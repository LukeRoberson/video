# Speakers

Here is a list of common speakers. This helps to get spelling right. Sometimes names will be in a different format (using middle names, etc); Use the format below.

Less common speakers, such as ones who are interviewed, are not listed here.

When added to a CSV, they are comma-separated, which means they need to be encased in double-quotes. This is so they're not seen as multiple separate fields.
