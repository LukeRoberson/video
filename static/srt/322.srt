1
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:03,710
How did it all get there?

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:06,190
These are the opening words of a booklet

3
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:08,789
that was published back in 1950

4
00:00:08,789 --> 00:00:13,550
and entitled Evolution versus the New World.

5
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:18,309
That booklet was just what our brothers needed at the time.

6
00:00:18,309 --> 00:00:20,989
For example, in 1954, a man in Algeria

7
00:00:20,989 --> 00:00:24,390
received a copy of the booklet from a friend.

8
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:27,070
He said, I devoured it.

9
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:29,589
And that booklet helped him to come to an appreciation

10
00:00:29,589 --> 00:00:34,149
of Jehovah as his creator, and he became our brother.

11
00:00:34,149 --> 00:00:40,270
Well, Evolution versus Creation is still an issue today.

12
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:42,710
And as touched on in some of our comments,

13
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:46,270
Jehovah's organization has provided additional tools

14
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:49,590
that help us both to strengthen our own faith

15
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:51,710
in Jehovah's our creator.

16
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:55,950
And also to help us aid others to come to know Jehovah

17
00:00:55,950 --> 00:01:01,030
as their all-wise and loving creator.

18
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:04,030
These tools help us to follow the instructions

19
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:10,359
that are found in 1 Peter 3, verse 15.

20
00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:12,159
Please open your Bibles to this scripture,

21
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:15,000
and as we read it, we'll notice two things.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,120
First of all, the scripture encourages us

23
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,719
to make a defense for our faith, and then it

24
00:01:19,719 --> 00:01:24,239
tells us the spirit in which we should make that defense.

25
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:29,079
1 Peter 3, verse 15 says,

26
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:32,680
But sanctify the Christ as Lord in your hearts.

27
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:36,159
Always ready to make a defense before everyone

28
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:40,400
who demands of you a reason for the hope you have,

29
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:45,159
but doing so with a mild temper and deep respect.

30
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:46,680
So there are two key points here.

31
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:51,040
First of all, we are expected to make a defense for our faith,

32
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:55,920
and that includes our faith in Jehovah as our creator.

33
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,319
Second, it tells us as we make that defense,

34
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:04,120
we should do it with a mild temper and deep respect.

35
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:07,599
Now, over the years, our message about evolution

36
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:10,599
and creation has not changed.

37
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:13,960
However, we have refined the methods

38
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:17,560
that we use to present that message.

39
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,680
The approach of the booklet evolution

40
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,000
versus the New World was very straightforward and direct.

41
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,080
And if you read it, you may say some parts of it

42
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,919
are even confrontational.

43
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:31,120
You can see that from the very title of the booklet,

44
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,879
evolution versus the New World.

45
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:38,120
Then on page three of that booklet, it says,

46
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:42,680
evolution and the Bible collide head on,

47
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,879
which survives the crash.

48
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:49,520
And it continues, evolution versus the New World,

49
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,159
which wins the war.

50
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:56,599
However, our discussions about evolution and creation

51
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:59,120
do not have to end in a collision

52
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,840
or going to war with the householder.

53
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,680
Really, what we need to do is establish

54
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,120
what are the facts and what do the facts reveal?

55
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:14,599
We may be surprised to find that there is even some common ground

56
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:17,479
that we have with those who believe in evolution.

57
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:21,840
For example, a witness student may read in his science textbook

58
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,879
claims that the earth and the solar system

59
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,319
are billions of years old.

60
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:31,039
Now, does this conflict with what the Bible teaches?

61
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:32,960
Not necessarily.

62
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:37,639
The Bible reveals that the earth and the solar system,

63
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:40,520
the universe, were in existence

64
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,960
before the beginning of the first creative day.

65
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:48,280
So these things could well be billions of years old.

66
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,120
What we need to do is determine the facts

67
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:56,240
and then base our conclusions on those facts.

68
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,080
And this is the approach that's taken

69
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:03,080
by two powerful brochures that we received back in 2010.

70
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,080
The one brochure is, was life created,

71
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,360
and the second, the origin of life,

72
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,840
five questions worth asking.

73
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,360
The approach of both these brochures

74
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,920
is positive and it's practical,

75
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,879
and they help us to answer the question,

76
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:24,160
how did it all get here?

77
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,920
For example, if we look at page two

78
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,120
of the was life created brochure,

79
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,480
under a heading entitled,

80
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,920
what is the purpose of this brochure?

81
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,040
It states the following.

82
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,680
It is not the purpose of this material

83
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,759
to ridicule the views either a fundamentalist

84
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,399
or of those who choose not to believe in God.

85
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:47,519
Rather, it is our hope that this brochure

86
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:51,639
will prompt you to examine again the basis

87
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:54,199
for some of your beliefs.

88
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:57,439
Then the brochure, the origin of life on page three,

89
00:04:57,439 --> 00:04:58,720
says this.

90
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:04,439
Sooner or later, all of us need to confront the question,

91
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:08,480
was life created or did it evolve?

92
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:11,240
This brochure will present just some of the evidence

93
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:15,879
that has led many to believe that life was created.

94
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:18,319
There's nothing confrontational about this,

95
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:22,920
we're simply being encouraged to examine the facts.

96
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,439
And after we've separated the fact from the fiction,

97
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:32,120
then we want to determine exactly what are

98
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,279
the needs of the householder.

99
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:36,800
It may not be necessary for us to go into

100
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,959
a detailed discussion about DNA or RNA

101
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:42,639
or pro-cariotic cells.

102
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,600
Now if we have to explain those things,

103
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:48,120
we're grateful that we have these two brochures to help us.

104
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,480
However in many cases, a simple illustration

105
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,720
may be all that is needed to convince our listeners

106
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,199
of the existence of a creator.

107
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:01,079
For example, a missionary in Cambodia

108
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:04,279
took his camera to a motorbike shop

109
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:05,800
and he asked the owner of the shop

110
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,000
to spread out the metal and plastic parts

111
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,800
of a small motorbike on the floor of the shop

112
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,399
and the missionary took a picture of those parts.

113
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:17,399
Then he would show that photograph to a householder

114
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:18,879
and ask them,

115
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,800
now do you think all these parts can just come together

116
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,680
and become a motorbike?

117
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,040
And the answer is of course not.

118
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,639
But then he shows them a second picture

119
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,959
with the shop owner standing amongst the parts

120
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,839
and then he asks them,

121
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:38,439
now do you think these parts can become a motorbike?

122
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:40,360
And the householder smiles and nods

123
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:43,040
and he gets the point.

124
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:46,600
So usually we're not talking to staunch evolution

125
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,519
as people who make it their life gold

126
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:52,680
or promote evolution and discredit the Bible.

127
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,519
For the most part, the people we talk to

128
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:57,360
have had the theory of evolution thrust at them

129
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,399
all their lives and they just need to know

130
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:02,439
and learn the truth.

131
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:05,279
So the foundation of our belief in Jehovah

132
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:09,839
as our creator is solid, it's based on fact.

133
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:13,120
And that same faith convinces us

134
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:18,120
that the promises of a righteous new world will come true.

135
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:22,399
Evolution offers no such future.

136
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:23,720
So with full confidence,

137
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:27,199
may we continue to uphold the sovereignty of Jehovah

138
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:30,959
and his creation and may we defend our faith

139
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:32,839
by sticking to the facts

140
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:35,160
and then presenting those facts

141
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:39,199
in the way that is understandable to our listeners.

142
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:43,360
If we do this, they too will recognize the truth

143
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,199
of Genesis chapter one, verse one.

144
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:49,399
In the beginning, God created.
