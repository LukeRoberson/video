1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:05,040
What does the master expect from us?

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:10,039
In Jesus' prophecy about the conclusion of the system of things,

3
00:00:10,039 --> 00:00:15,039
he not only gives us signs as to when the end would be close.

4
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:24,039
He also gives us pointed advice and counsel on how to be prepared and ready for Jehovah's Day.

5
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:29,039
What does the master expect from us when he comes?

6
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:36,039
Now we look at our text for today here on Matthew 24, verse 33.

7
00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:46,740
Jesus says likewise also you when you see all these things.

8
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:49,740
So obviously this applies to the anointed.

9
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:55,740
And the parables throughout Matthew 24 and 25 apply to the anointed.

10
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:59,740
Of course those of the other sheep can benefit greatly from the advice

11
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:04,739
because it will help them also to be in a state of preparedness

12
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:07,739
and to be acceptable to the master.

13
00:01:07,739 --> 00:01:10,739
Now he says here in our text,

14
00:01:10,739 --> 00:01:14,739
know that he is near at the doors.

15
00:01:14,739 --> 00:01:18,739
So when I see all these things, they will know.

16
00:01:18,739 --> 00:01:20,739
His coming is imminent.

17
00:01:21,739 --> 00:01:27,739
They will know that he is there to visit them and to take them.

18
00:01:27,739 --> 00:01:35,340
Now they are not afraid of this event because they love their master

19
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:40,340
and their master has taught them what they need to do to be acceptable

20
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:44,340
and they are determined to live up to those requirements.

21
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:51,620
What we would like to do now is focus on two of the lessons Jesus gave

22
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:54,620
these apostles during this prophecy.

23
00:01:54,620 --> 00:02:02,620
And the first one we would like to look at just very briefly is in Matthew 24 and verse 42.

24
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:07,620
It says keep on the watch.

25
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:11,620
And the second one is in verse 44.

26
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:16,620
It says prove yourselves ready.

27
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:20,620
Now these two work hand in hand with each other

28
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:28,620
and they are highlighted in Matthew 25 with the parable of the discrete virgins.

29
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:32,620
They kept on the watch by keeping their lamps burning

30
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:38,620
and they proved themselves ready by having additional oil for their lamps.

31
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:42,620
But now for us, how does that apply to us?

32
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,620
How do we do these two things?

33
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:47,620
Keep on the watch and prove ourselves ready.

34
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:51,620
Let's talk about the first one, keeping on the watch.

35
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:56,620
Now it is not possible to stay awake day after day, week after week.

36
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:59,620
So this is not a physical requirement.

37
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,620
It is much deeper.

38
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,620
It speaks about our attitude.

39
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,620
How do we feel on the inside?

40
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:11,620
Our inner response, do we really believe the master is coming?

41
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:16,620
Our convictions, do we know that this is the truth?

42
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:20,620
And the work we do is of utmost importance.

43
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:31,620
Our commitment to review people as precious to God and help them to come into a close relationship with Jehovah.

44
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:38,620
So our attitude is summarized by this expression keep on the watch.

45
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:42,620
As for the second one, prove yourselves ready.

46
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:45,620
Now this refers more to our actions.

47
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:48,620
We prove that we are ready.

48
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:53,620
For example, a man tells a woman he loves her.

49
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:57,620
That he will be loyal to her forever.

50
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,620
He marries her.

51
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:02,620
Does that prove his love?

52
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,620
Not totally.

53
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:11,620
He proves his love by loyalty sticking to her through the ups and downs of life.

54
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:16,620
So how do we prove that we are ready?

55
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:19,620
We prove it by our commitment.

56
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,620
Do we have enough oil?

57
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:23,620
Do we let our light shine?

58
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:26,620
Do we preach at every opportunity?

59
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:32,620
Do we relentlessly search for the sheep and spare no effort,

60
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:39,620
even make major sacrifices to help other people learn about Jehovah?

61
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:46,620
So these two aspects of Jesus gave us advice on very important our attitude and our actions.

62
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,620
These two need to come together.

63
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:53,620
Now there's a warning in this prophecy also given by Jesus.

64
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:59,620
Do not think for a moment that the end is far off.

65
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:04,620
It's an excellent principle in Ecclesiastes 11 verse 4

66
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:08,620
that shows how attitude and action work together

67
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:13,620
and how we need to view matters from Jehovah's perspective.

68
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:16,620
Ecclesiastes 11 verse 4.

69
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:20,339
It says,

70
00:05:20,339 --> 00:05:24,339
the one who watches the wind will not so seed

71
00:05:24,339 --> 00:05:27,339
and the one who looks at the clouds will not reap.

72
00:05:27,339 --> 00:05:29,339
So when a person looks at the wind,

73
00:05:29,339 --> 00:05:31,339
he says, oh, my seed is going to blow away.

74
00:05:31,339 --> 00:05:33,339
It's no point sewing today.

75
00:05:33,339 --> 00:05:36,339
Or if he watches the clouds,

76
00:05:36,339 --> 00:05:39,339
he's going to say, well, it looks like it's going to rain.

77
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:44,339
If I bring the harvest in now, it will get wet before I have time to put it in the storehouse

78
00:05:44,339 --> 00:05:48,339
so I don't think I will be reaping today.

79
00:05:48,339 --> 00:05:50,339
Now this has applied to us.

80
00:05:50,339 --> 00:05:55,339
While we have work to do, we have much work in the harvest to do.

81
00:05:55,339 --> 00:06:00,339
We cannot second guess when the master will come.

82
00:06:00,339 --> 00:06:02,339
He's given us work to do.

83
00:06:02,339 --> 00:06:07,339
It's our responsibility to do the work.

84
00:06:07,339 --> 00:06:14,339
It is his responsibility to look after the weather as to when the time will come.

85
00:06:14,339 --> 00:06:18,339
Do we really focus on that assignment we have to do?

86
00:06:18,339 --> 00:06:23,339
If we try to calculate exactly the moment when Christ will come,

87
00:06:23,339 --> 00:06:28,339
it will debilitate our efforts because Christ said, you know neither the hour.

88
00:06:28,339 --> 00:06:32,339
And at an hour you do not think to be it, he will come.

89
00:06:32,339 --> 00:06:34,339
And we have work to do.

90
00:06:34,339 --> 00:06:36,339
We're not on with our work.

91
00:06:36,339 --> 00:06:38,339
We know how to do it.

92
00:06:38,339 --> 00:06:40,339
We know what we must do.

93
00:06:40,339 --> 00:06:43,339
We work along with a faithful and discreet slave

94
00:06:43,339 --> 00:06:46,339
and who can ask for better companions.

95
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:50,339
So the two lessons, keep on the watch

96
00:06:50,339 --> 00:06:53,339
and prove yourselves ready.

97
00:06:53,339 --> 00:06:59,339
Are very important for us if we want to gain the pleasure and the approval of our master.

98
00:06:59,339 --> 00:07:03,339
Do not allow anything to get in the way.

99
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:07,339
Carefully examine our own personal attitude.

100
00:07:07,339 --> 00:07:10,339
Let us prioritize the preaching work.

101
00:07:10,339 --> 00:07:12,339
Spare no effort.

102
00:07:12,339 --> 00:07:18,339
Do not allow Satan and his schemes, his ideas to distract us.

103
00:07:18,339 --> 00:07:24,339
Remember, no one can prove our loyalty to Jehovah for us.

104
00:07:24,339 --> 00:07:27,339
That is something only we can do.

105
00:07:27,339 --> 00:07:32,339
And Jehovah, the judge of all the earth, can read hearts.
