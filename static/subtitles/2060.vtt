00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:15.949
At John 1520, Jesus said, Aslave is not greater than His Master.

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:21.350
If they have persecuted Me, they will also persecute You.

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:25.309
How will we react when we are mistreated?

00:00:25.309 --> 00:00:29.390
How will we find the strength to endure?

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.590
We have a record of faithful servants of old.

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:38.630
We know that Jehovah's people can endure.

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:44.350
But we also have the record of Jehovah's Witnesses in modern times.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:52.189
The following video draws on footage from two previously released videos by the organization.

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:55.869
It highlights two outstanding examples.

00:00:55.869 --> 00:01:02.390
Our brothers in Germany during World War II and our brothers in the former Soviet Union

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:05.629
in the years that followed the war.

00:01:05.629 --> 00:01:16.109
It also reveals the tactics that enemies of the truth consistently use to no avail against Jehovah's people.

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:21.950
Reviewing and meditating on the examples of these faithful brothers and sisters

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.310
will prepare us for what lies ahead,

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:33.620
will fill us with courage and will strengthen our faith.

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:39.900
On January 30, 1933, Adolf Hitler comes to power.

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.299
Hitler gave the people jobs.

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:47.500
He restored their faith in the Fatherland.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.459
He has hailed as their Savior.

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:56.459
But the witnesses could not give to a man what they believed belonged to God.

00:01:56.459 --> 00:02:00.620
Thus, the battle line was drawn over a simple greeting.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:05.620
Heil Hitler.

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:14.180
Jehovah's Witnesses refused to say a Heil Hitler because it meant salvation comes from Hitler.

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:19.219
At his job in a steel mill, one witness faced this test.

00:02:19.219 --> 00:02:24.860
I was the only one among 2000 who did not raise my hand and did not return the German salute.

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.780
Every day running the gauntlet since I was required to give the German salute and I simply said,

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.939
good day.

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:35.620
Children were drawn into the battle.

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.500
Six-year-old Paul Gerhard Kusaro, like other witness children,

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.699
was pressured by students and teachers.

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:49.939
As soon as I entered school, the head teacher and the pupils confronted me

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:53.860
and tried to make me say Heil Hitler.

00:02:53.860 --> 00:03:00.539
More than 800 children were taken away from their witness parents by the Gestapo.

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:02.860
In one German state after another,

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:10.490
the police shut down meetings of the witnesses and prohibit their door-to-door preaching.

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:16.289
At first, there were nasty words, sometimes a beating.

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:23.979
But soon enough, it led to the first arrests.

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:33.259
Starting in 1937, Jehovah's Witnesses were given a purple triangle as a sign.

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:42.310
Jehovah's Witnesses were the only religious group that made up a separate category of inmates.

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:49.310
The Jehovah's Witnesses received especially severe treatment.

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.310
The goal was to destroy this religious group.

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:58.659
There were to be no more witnesses in Germany.

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:03.580
The Nazis obsessed with breaking the Witnesses' tabern commitment

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.580
and made them an extraordinary offer.

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:10.139
Each witness could buy his freedom for a price,

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:13.419
his signature and his faith.

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:18.860
Witnesses and prisons and camps were repeatedly handed a piece of paper on a pen.

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:22.100
Very few signed.

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.100
When I was to be released from prison, I was given a paper to sign.

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.100
It required that I give up my faith

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.819
and recognize the German government as the highest authority,

00:04:32.819 --> 00:04:35.139
place myself under the Hitler government

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:39.899
and consider the Bible as a false doctrine.

00:04:39.899 --> 00:04:45.540
I said, that's out of the question.

00:04:45.579 --> 00:04:48.779
The unity among the sisters and the brothers

00:04:48.779 --> 00:04:51.459
that gave us so much strength.

00:04:51.459 --> 00:04:55.420
It was our aim to endure under all circumstances.

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:57.259
We never prayed to be set free.

00:04:57.259 --> 00:04:59.379
We prayed for strength to endure.

00:04:59.379 --> 00:05:01.259
Everything else was unimportant.

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:24.379
What mattered was standing up for Jehovah's Name.

00:05:24.379 --> 00:05:32.180
On February 19, 1951, the head of the security police presented a secret plan to Stalin.

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:38.220
All of Jehovah's Witnesses, including infants and pregnant women, would be exiled.

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:41.699
The plan was codenamed Operation North.

00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:46.060
Stalin approved it.

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:51.579
Interestingly, the witnesses were offered a way to avoid deportation.

00:05:51.579 --> 00:05:53.579
The manning charge of the deportation

00:05:53.579 --> 00:05:57.100
of our family tried to persuade father to sign a paper,

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:00.899
renouncing the organization of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:06:00.939 --> 00:06:04.939
Few witnesses, if any, accepted this offer.

00:06:04.939 --> 00:06:10.100
Once in Siberia, the witnesses were dropped off at settlements along the rail lines.

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:15.540
The majority of the witnesses were forced to cut trees.

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:18.420
We recalled the time when the Israelites lived in Egypt

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:20.500
and how they were forced to work.

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:23.139
We prayed, God, make our faith stronger,

00:06:23.139 --> 00:06:28.889
so that this work, which is beyond our strength, will not shake us.

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:33.329
Stalin's death in 1953 brought hope of relief.

00:06:33.329 --> 00:06:37.569
That relief would be a long time in coming.

00:06:37.569 --> 00:06:43.170
The Neurigin went on in the same course, they arrested and sentenced us.

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:48.420
Most arrested witnesses were sentenced to labor camps.

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:51.699
In court, they could not expect a fair trial.

00:06:51.699 --> 00:06:56.420
Guilty verdicts had already been decided upon.

00:06:56.420 --> 00:07:01.060
Under the crush of administration special re-education camps were set up,

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:04.500
designed to turn inmates from their beliefs.

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:09.779
During this period, propaganda films designed to discredit Jehovah's Witnesses

00:07:09.779 --> 00:07:13.060
were distributed throughout the USSR.

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:24.370
Whoever has studied persecution on the past

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:26.610
has seen that in one way or another,

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:29.490
persecution is always built on a lie.

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:33.300
The victim is slandered.

00:07:33.379 --> 00:07:35.779
Besides using propaganda, for many years,

00:07:35.779 --> 00:07:39.939
the KGB recruited informers to infiltrate witness congregations.

00:07:40.899 --> 00:07:46.579
For instance, in 1968, the KGB District Director offered Nikolai Bytkov an assignment.

00:07:47.699 --> 00:07:50.819
He requested me to spy on Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:07:52.579 --> 00:07:56.579
One witness booklet that compared the teaching of evolution with the Bible

00:07:56.579 --> 00:07:58.819
changed the KGB Informer's viewpoint.

00:07:59.699 --> 00:08:01.540
No one could answer that question.

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:03.699
How life appeared.

00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:10.129
In the Bible, I could find answers to those questions.

00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:16.529
In Kbarovsk in 1984, Nikolai Bytkov now abaptized witness

00:08:16.529 --> 00:08:20.449
and several fellow believers were accused of anti-Soviet activities.

00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:26.449
But the all-out attack on the witness's faith backfired on the persecutors.

00:08:28.939 --> 00:08:31.180
In Germany and in Soviet times,

00:08:31.259 --> 00:08:34.779
they thought that you could get rid of an idea by using extreme violence.

00:08:35.899 --> 00:08:40.539
But it turned out that when an idea is strong, it makes people strong.

00:08:40.539 --> 00:08:43.580
So the outcome was just the opposite of what was expected.

00:08:45.779 --> 00:08:50.899
In March 1991, Jehovah's Witnesses were legally registered in Russia.

00:08:53.389 --> 00:08:57.470
I think it is frightening, only if you've never faced difficulties.

00:08:58.190 --> 00:09:02.509
But once you face them, you know that special strength.

00:09:04.269 --> 00:09:11.070
When we rely on Jehovah, we ask for his guidance, we ask for his help, we will always get it.

00:09:34.139 --> 00:09:37.340
In addition to horrible physical treatment,

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:46.299
God's people faced slander, outright lies and fabrications, even in the form of propaganda films,

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:51.820
opposes attempted to infiltrate our brotherhood with informants.

00:09:53.100 --> 00:10:00.860
But as we saw in the example of Nikolai Bytkov, such devious plans are in vain when

00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:03.500
pitted against the truth from God's word.

00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:12.299
As Professor Nikolai Gjenko noted, when an idea is strong, it makes people strong.

00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:19.259
What idea can be stronger than the reality of our father, Jehovah,

00:10:19.259 --> 00:10:25.740
his reigning King Jesus Christ and his kingdom now poised to thwart all opposition.

00:10:26.379 --> 00:10:32.379
And so, what people can possibly be stronger than Jehovah's people.

00:10:32.379 --> 00:10:39.820
As our brothers in Russia and other areas of the earth face renewed opposition,

00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:47.100
and as we all face the prospect of being mistreated, just as our Master Jesus was,

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:54.779
we are determined to stand firm and remain faithful no matter what the enemies of truth attempt.
