00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:11.460
My name's Jonathan and I've been in Bethel for eight years.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.460
When I was young and people would ask me what my goals were,

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:15.060
I'd always say it was to find it.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:18.460
But I don't think I really knew what my goals were at that time.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.059
It took quite a while for me to find out what I really wanted to do.

00:00:23.059 --> 00:00:27.059
After I finished school, I did a course for two years in business studies

00:00:27.059 --> 00:00:29.059
and then I did work full time.

00:00:29.059 --> 00:00:31.059
But I think through my associations,

00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:33.659
I started realizing that really there's more

00:00:33.659 --> 00:00:36.460
that I could be doing in Jehovah's service.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.859
Because I wanted to taste what Bethel was like,

00:00:38.859 --> 00:00:40.460
it made me want to commute.

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.460
You can come as a visitor, you can come as a guest,

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.859
you can come to see friends that you've got in Bethel.

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:50.060
But it's not the same as actually being in Bethel

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.259
and working along with the brothers in the department.

00:00:53.259 --> 00:00:56.060
I really enjoy my assignment at Bethel.

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.060
So I hope to look after the accommodation.

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.659
We get requests from different members of the family to have personal guests.

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:04.859
We may receive requests from other branches

00:01:04.859 --> 00:01:08.859
and my job is to try and care for the accommodation needs.

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:12.859
It's a really great privilege to be able to work along and to help the family

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:14.859
and that is what our department does.

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:20.859
Something that I've always felt was it would be nicer to come to Bethel earlier.

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:22.859
I don't know why I waited till I was 23.

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:25.859
So if anyone else is thinking about what are they going to do,

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:27.859
should I try Bethel or just try it?

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:30.859
Because what you experience at Bethel, you'd not regret.
