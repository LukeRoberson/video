00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:13.859
Since my dedication and baptism, I have been serving in a territory where our work is under ban.

00:00:14.859 --> 00:00:22.859
When I was serving in the full-time ministry, I was assigned as a special pioneer to the territory where my future husband had been serving.

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.859
Then we got married, and now we are sharing in this special irony of service together.

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:34.859
We are persecuted, put on probation, and confronted by government officials.

00:00:34.859 --> 00:00:39.859
In difficult times, Jehovah personally assures me with the words from Isaiah.

00:00:39.859 --> 00:00:44.859
I will fortify you. Yes, I will help you.

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:56.719
The last time government officials came to our place, they took us to their office for questioning.

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:01.719
They said they had no choice, and we went in their car.

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:10.719
At that moment, I felt that Jehovah was not only giving me his holy spirit and wisdom, but also giving me the physical strength to go.

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:13.719
I was so thankful to him.

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:19.719
Indeed, on that day when we were taken in the car, I prayed to Jehovah.

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:23.719
Please help us to be able to give a witness about you.

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:26.719
A government official even said these words.

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:29.719
It's very interesting for us to talk with you.

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:35.719
When we talk with people of other faith, we never have our questions for the answer.

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:40.719
But you know the correct answers to our questions, and are capable of giving them.

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:47.719
Isaiah said to one five is a big help, because there, Jehovah is described as being like swooping birds.

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:50.719
After all, Jehovah is above me.

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:55.719
In this verse, he also promises that he will defend and save.

00:01:55.719 --> 00:02:04.719
Encounters with government officials and discussions with them have brought many blessings for our brothers, for our Bible students and for us.

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:11.719
But it has been a good opportunity for policemen too, because there are sincere ones among them who have a lot of questions.

00:02:11.719 --> 00:02:17.719
We have had good discussions, and I began to view them as my return visits.

00:02:17.719 --> 00:02:25.719
We have shared with our students how Jehovah is giving us strength, and how he is blessing us when we are talking with government officials.

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:29.719
As a result, they were able to stay strong in the faith.

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:34.719
After meeting with police, we never see that home trembling in fear.

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:43.719
On the contrary, we try to share in field service with our brothers and sisters even more, because it's also an encouragement for them.

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:49.719
We spend a lot of time sharing with them how Jehovah glorifies his name.

00:02:49.719 --> 00:02:58.719
In certain situations, through his words in the Psalms, Jehovah shows me that he is on my side, and I fully believe it.

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:05.719
Jehovah indeed is on my side, and he has shown me that people can do nothing to me.

00:03:05.719 --> 00:03:32.319
We participated with the construction when the Kingdom Hall was built the first time.

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:37.050
Everything was finished very nicely.

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:43.000
Then we were involved in the construction of the same Kingdom Hall the second time.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:53.000
And when we were close to the end of the construction and came to the construction site and saw everything burned out and ruined, we cried.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:00.889
So almost every day, unfriendly neighbors stopped us and continued to say to us,

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:04.889
stop your work, go out from our village.

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:10.419
In those moments, I just used to pray silently to Jehovah.

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:13.699
I was a bit afraid.

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:20.699
Since I had still fresh in my mind all the memory, the difficulties, and how the neighbors threw the stones at us.

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:28.389
But the words in Isaiah 41, verse 10, gave me strength.

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:33.389
Do not be afraid for I am with you. Do not be anxious for I am your God.

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:38.389
I will fortify you. I will really hold on to you with my right hand.

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:43.389
Reading these words always gave us power to continue our service.

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:48.389
I reflected on the words in AMIA 217.

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:51.389
Come, let us rebuild the walls of Jerusalem.

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:57.389
So that this disgrace will not continue. Jehovah wants this Kingdom Hall to be.

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:03.389
This is important to the people there. So I wanted their praise for Jehovah again.

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:07.389
It was more than clear that Jehovah is backing us.

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:14.389
The finished construction of that same Kingdom Hall the third time from floor to the roof in 45 days.

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:17.389
From human standpoint, this is not possible.

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:22.389
We worked closer with many elders and ministerial servants.

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:28.250
It was an enjoyable experience.

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:35.139
We felt Jehovah's hand. Jehovah's strength and our spirit.

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:40.610
He encouraged us and we felt that.

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:43.610
We cannot be silent. We have to praise God.

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:47.610
We see Him. We know Him.

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:57.610
Jehovah poured out His Holy Spirit and we gained confidence that Jehovah is always near and ready to help.

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:02.610
He is like a loving father holding us at our hands.

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:07.610
Endurance helped us to receive all the blessing we are experiencing now.

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:12.610
I am very much grateful to Jehovah God for all these blessings.

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:21.529
I realized more fully that for His name Jehovah becomes anything He wants.
