00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:08.199
We're also pleased to announce the release of a new brochure entitled answers to ten

00:00:08.199 --> 00:00:10.919
questions young people ask.

00:00:10.919 --> 00:00:18.199
The content of this 32-page full color brochure is based on articles in a wake and the

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:24.320
two volumes of questions young people ask, answers that work, as well as the young people

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.839
ask articles on the JW.org website.

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:34.359
This new brochure will be particularly helpful to those who speak a language in which that

00:00:34.359 --> 00:00:36.600
material is not available.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:43.280
However, all young people can benefit from this new brochure because the original articles

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.960
have been updated and rewritten.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.240
Each section of the brochure addresses one question.

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:56.759
After stating the question, the section begins with a pointed statement under the feature

00:00:56.759 --> 00:00:58.880
why it matters.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:05.920
Letting the reader know why that question is relevant, then what would you do scenario

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:12.760
is presented, putting the reader in a hypothetical situation related to the topic.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:18.959
After discussing various principles, scriptural advice directs the reader to the best answers

00:01:18.959 --> 00:01:21.959
for that particular question.

00:01:21.959 --> 00:01:27.040
The ten questions brochure is interactive, allowing the reader to write responses to

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.719
the various questions presented.

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:35.959
The final topic, how can the Bible help me, is designed to invite readers who are

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:40.439
not Jehovah's Witnesses to accept a Bible study.

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:46.920
The brochure makes numerous references to the JW.org website and directs readers to

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.840
more information that can be found there.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:56.200
Also, the brochure is designed in such a way that young people can be comfortable sharing

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.640
it with their peers and with others in the ministry.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:09.080
This brochure is already approved for translation into 324 languages.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:18.000
Of these languages, 223 do not produce a wake and 262 have not produced the young people

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.599
ask book.

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:26.199
So we expect that answers to ten questions young people ask will help many more use benefit

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:30.000
from the Bible's practical wisdom.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.400
Following this program, digital formats of the brochure will become available on the

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:42.479
JW.org website, the JW Library at and on Watchtower Online Library as they are produced

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:44.479
in each language.

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:50.319
Traditionally, printed copies of the brochure can be requested through your congregation

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:52.159
