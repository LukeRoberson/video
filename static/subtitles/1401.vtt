00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:24.449
Let's do this a bit of a neat freak you don't say

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:31.690
So last time we discussed how God created us to live forever which raises the question. Why do we die?

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:33.689
totally

00:00:33.689 --> 00:00:35.289
Totally what

00:00:35.289 --> 00:00:38.329
No, like I mean, I totally agree. That's what we talked about. Oh

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:41.329
Right

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:43.810
Let's open to Romans 5 verse 12

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:53.990
Wait, why don't I read it out loud so we can both enjoy it? That is why

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:00.829
Just as through one man sin entered into the world and death through sin and

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.430
So death spread to all men because they had all sinned

00:01:06.989 --> 00:01:09.069
Okay, hold it is Adam the one man

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:11.269
Exactly

00:01:11.269 --> 00:01:13.269
This doesn't make sense

00:01:13.629 --> 00:01:17.109
You said Adam was perfect. It wouldn't die. That's right

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.670
But then he sins and loses that

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:25.590
So what's that got to do with me? I die because he's stupid. Well

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:28.510
Maybe not how I would have put it

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.879
Maybe we can think of it this way when

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:39.159
When parents with a severe genetic defect have children what happens?

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.040
Usually the kids inherit it precisely

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:49.959
When Adam sinned that sin became like a genetic defect that caused sickness, aging and death

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.640
And since we're all his children. Oh

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:00.159
Brilliant I

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:01.680
Get it

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.400
Why don't we watch a little video that helps put it all together?
