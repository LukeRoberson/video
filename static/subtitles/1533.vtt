00:00:02.799 --> 00:00:04.799
My name is Abby.

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.799
These are my friends and family.

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:09.800
This is me and Laura.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:10.800
Laura's my sister.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.800
But up until a few months ago,

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:21.530
I didn't even know who she was.

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:25.530
It all began when I got lost going home in the subway.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.530
A woman was nice enough to help me out.

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.530
Her name was Laura.

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:35.509
She offered me a map,

00:00:35.509 --> 00:00:38.509
and I offered her a tract.

00:00:39.509 --> 00:00:41.509
But it turned out that she was a witness,

00:00:41.509 --> 00:00:51.270
and I was surprised to find out that she lived near my apartment.

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.270
It made me wonder, though.

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.270
I had never seen her at her congregation.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.200
Not long after that,

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.200
the clerks had me over for supper.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.200
They're awesome cooks,

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.200
and Brother Clark is an elder in my hall.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.200
I mentioned what happened to me on the subway,

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.200
and he knew Laura right away.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.200
He explained that she was in our congregation,

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.200
but had been feeling down for quite a while.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.200
She had become inactive,

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.200
and even though the brothers had been visiting her

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.200
and doing their best to help,

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.200
she just seemed to be stuck.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.200
So I asked if it would be okay for me to visit her.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.200
Brother Clark thought it was a great idea.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.200
I was going to help Laura.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.200
I knew we'd be best friends in no time.

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.310
But we weren't.

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.310
I was able to talk to her,

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.310
but it wasn't a good time.

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:58.450
And it didn't go well at all.

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.450
I felt so silly afterwards.

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.450
All I could think was,

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.450
who am I to jump in and try to fix things?

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.450
I have no idea what I'm doing.

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.449
I should have just left it to the elders.

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:12.449
If they hadn't been able to help her,

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:16.240
what chance did I have?

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.240
The next time I saw Brother Clark,

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.240
I explained what happened,

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.240
told him how I felt,

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.240
and just kept apologizing for everything.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.240
But he was an angry,

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.240
or disappointed, or anything.

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.240
Instead, he commended me for taking an interest in Laura.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.240
He told me that the elders weren't going to give up on her,

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.240
and that I should indeeder.

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.240
Then he showed me Jesus' illustration

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.240
in Luke chapter 15, verse 8.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.240
Talking about those who strayed from the flock,

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.240
he said,

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.240
or what woman who has ten-track macoins,

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.240
if she loses one of the dragmas,

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.240
does not light a lamp,

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:56.240
and sweep her house,

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:03.110
and search carefully until she finds it.

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.110
He told me that the obligation to help a weak Christian

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.110
was not beyond my abilities,

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:13.110
but that I had to be persistent and keep searching.

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.110
I realized that this wasn't just a coin,

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:30.020
or an heirloom.

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:32.020
I had lost my sister,

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.020
and I didn't even know it.

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:39.020
I knew that I had to do whatever I could to help.

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:42.020
But this time, I wanted to do it right.

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:45.020
So I did research,

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.020
and I prayed,

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.020
and I prepared.

00:03:49.020 --> 00:04:01.449
At first, I just tried to make up

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:07.009
for how things had gone last time.

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:09.009
She still didn't open up much,

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:13.979
but it was a start.

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:14.979
I kept coming,

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:20.339
and so did the elders.

00:04:20.339 --> 00:05:25.029
It took time,

00:05:25.029 --> 00:05:27.029
and it took effort,

00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:31.410
but we started to get to know each other better,

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:41.699
and she started to share more with me.

00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:49.769
Sometimes, out of discouragement or depression,

00:05:49.769 --> 00:05:52.769
she could say things she really didn't mean,

00:05:52.769 --> 00:05:54.769
wild talk.

00:05:54.769 --> 00:05:58.769
But I just tried to be a good listener.

00:05:58.769 --> 00:06:01.769
One time, I gave her a big hug,

00:06:01.769 --> 00:06:03.769
and told her,

00:06:03.769 --> 00:06:05.769
I love you so much.

00:06:05.769 --> 00:06:19.160
And in the end,

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.160
I discovered something very precious,

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.160
that our brothers and sisters

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:28.160
can become lost and need our help.

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.160
And we don't need to be elders,

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.160
just to listen,

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.160
and to love.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.160
I found Laura,

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:39.160
my lost sister,

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:42.160
and my new friend.
