00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:14.029
Jehovah gave us the Bible so that we could know him and love him.

00:00:14.029 --> 00:00:18.469
He wants us to become his friends.

00:00:18.469 --> 00:00:21.469
Jehovah made sure that the Bible would be available,

00:00:21.469 --> 00:00:25.469
no matter where people live or what language they speak.

00:00:25.469 --> 00:00:33.100
The Bible Museum, located at the branch office of Jehovah's Witnesses in Brussels, Belgium,

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.100
with the theme, the Bible and the low countries,

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:45.100
tells the fascinating story of Bible translation and production in the coastal region of Northwestern Europe.

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:51.100
In this museum, you will learn of honest-hearted people who came to love the Bible

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:59.000
and wanted to make it available to others.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Throughout the Middle Ages, the Roman Catholic Church feared the spread of Bibles in vernacular languages.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Understanding the Bible would have exposed the unchristian behavior of the Church.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
This led to cruel persecution of Bible translators.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:26.000
What role did the region of the low countries play in this overheated religious atmosphere?

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:34.000
By the 16th century, the city of Antwerp, Belgium, had become the leading commercial center of Western Europe,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Antwerp's relatively tolerant religious and political climate,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:45.000
made it an ideal hub for translating and printing Bibles in common everyday languages.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.000
About 270 printers, publishers and booksellers were located in this cosmopolitan city.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000
In addition, the significant seaport was perfect for smuggling Bibles to neighboring countries.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000
One of the many printers working in Antwerp was Jakob van Lee's belt.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.000
In 1526, he courageously published the first complete Bible in Dutch.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
This was one of the first Bibles printed in a single volume.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Van Lee's belt eventually printed a total of 19 Bible editions.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Despite the comparatively safe working conditions in Antwerp,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Bible publishers were not fully protected from the Church.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Van Lee's belt was condemned to death for including marginal notes in his final edition of the Dutch Bible,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
notes which the Catholic Church found offensive to their dogma.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.000
He was one of several Antwerp Bible printers who were executed for their work.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:53.000
A translator, who also published his work in Antwerp, was the French scholar Jacques Lafevre de Taple.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
He dedicated himself to restoring the original meaning of ancient writings

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
and studied closely the Latin Volgate Bible.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:12.000
He strongly believed in the right of every Christian to read and learn the Bible personally.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Therefore, the Fevre devoted all his energy to translating the Bible into French.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
It was the first complete Bible to be printed in this language.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:30.000
He was sure the Gospels would be, as he said, purely proclaimed throughout the world

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
so that people may no longer be led astray by alien doctrines of men.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Although his Bible translation initially was approved by the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:51.000
1546, the Fevre's second edition was placed on the Roman Catholic Church's index of forbidden books.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Another courageous man, one who translated the scriptures into English,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
was a clergyman and a scholar of Greek and Latin.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
The name of this man was William Tindale.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
He was passionate about God's word.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Tindale wrote,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:16.000
we must desire God to make us understand and feel wherefore the scripture was given

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
that we may apply the medicine of the scripture.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:26.000
For translating the New Testament into English, he was chased and hunted by church and state.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000
He sought refuge in various cities, including the city of Antwerp.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Here, he published a revised version of the New Testament

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:44.000
and his translation of the Pentateuch, where he used Jehovah's name for the first time in an English translation.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000
Tindale also was executed for his translation work.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Publishing Bibles in Spain was a very dangerous undertaking.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:05.000
For this reason, in 1543, the translator Francisco D'Anthinus had his New Testament in Spanish also printed in Antwerp.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:12.000
It was the first Spanish version to be translated directly from the original Greek text.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.000
He wrote,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:21.000
it seemed to me that I had but one task to commit to the press the work I had taken pains to produce

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:29.949
and then commended to God the father of the whole business for whose cause it had been made.

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:38.949
Francisco D'Anthinus was also arrested for his work, yet some copies of his New Testament made it to Spain.

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:45.949
It had a strong influence on other Spanish translations, such as the widely known Reyna Valera Bible,

00:05:45.949 --> 00:05:50.949
the first edition of which was also printed in the low countries.

00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:57.420
There are many more intriguing gems for you to discover in this museum,

00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:03.420
like the Antwerp Polyglot, which contains Bible text in five languages,

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:13.860
and the secretly produced Dutch Jehovah Bible, all printed in the low countries.

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:19.860
All these men displayed love for God's Word and Jehovah blessed their efforts

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:30.860
because the work that they did set in motion a series of events that have resulted in God's Word being available today in thousands of languages.

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:40.129
The Bible Museum in Belgium is one of our many museums around the world,

00:06:40.129 --> 00:06:46.129
each highlighting unique aspects of the fascinating history of God's Word.

00:06:46.129 --> 00:06:50.129
These exhibitions deepen our appreciation for the Bible,

00:06:50.129 --> 00:06:55.129
and the truthfulness of 1 Peter 1, 25, where it says,

00:06:55.129 --> 00:06:59.129
the saying of Jehovah and doers forever.
