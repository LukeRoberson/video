00:00:10.289 --> 00:00:17.609
How exciting it is to see millions who are streaming to Jehovah's Pure Worship today.

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.890
This is in fulfillment of Isaiah's prophecy.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:28.010
At chapter 2, verse 2, it says in the final part of the days, the mountain of the house

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:34.149
of Jehovah will become firmly established above the top of the mountains, and it will be

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:41.590
raised up above the hills, and to it all the nations will stream.

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:48.829
People worldwide recognize the superiority of Jehovah's Elevated Worship, and are eagerly

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:52.950
joining us in rendering sacred service to Jehovah God.

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:58.509
To assist in caring for the spiritual needs of this worldwide brotherhood, the governing

00:00:58.509 --> 00:01:04.230
body has established branch offices in 89 different countries.

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:09.250
Bethel family members serving full time at these facilities care for a variety of vital

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.069
assignments.

00:01:11.069 --> 00:01:16.049
As the preaching work continues to progress, and thousands more join us in worshipping

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.829
Jehovah, there's an increasing need for more volunteers to assist with the work done

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:27.349
at Bethel, and in other remote facilities such as translation offices.

00:01:27.349 --> 00:01:33.129
At the same time, the costs for expanding branch facilities to house more Bethelites

00:01:33.129 --> 00:01:36.670
may tax our available resources.

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.469
So how is the need for more workers being met?

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:46.230
In addition to those serving at Bethel full time, the personnel committee of the governing

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:51.750
body invites willing ones to serve as part-time commuters.

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:58.280
What are part-time commuters?

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:04.159
Part-time commuters live within commuting distance of Bethel, or a remote facility,

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:10.479
and arrange for their own accommodations, most of them work secretly to support themselves,

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:15.639
but have arranged their affairs to serve at Bethel a half day or more each week, traveling

00:02:15.639 --> 00:02:19.639
back and forth from their own homes.

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:24.879
They're assigned to care for a wide variety of Bethel assignments, including serving

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:29.199
as tour guides for the thousands of visitors touring Bethel.

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:35.800
They work in the computer department, food service, engineering, grounds maintenance, translation,

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:41.840
building services, and many, many other departments.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:51.639
As of March 2018, there are 9,500 part-time commuters serving worldwide.

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:56.599
What sacrifices do these hardworking brothers and sisters make to share in the work

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:59.439
being done at Bethel?

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:05.960
What adjustments have they made in their lives to make themselves available to serve?

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:11.680
When I first started coming to Bethel, I would get up at 4 in the morning to take 3 buses.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.479
Even though it was a long commute, I was happy to do it.

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:18.639
Our challenge is economic.

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:25.539
We already had a simple life, and we simplified further to be able to continue as commuters.

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:31.930
We have challenges, but we don't want to consider giving this up.

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:38.129
We constantly pray to Jehovah, and trust in him and continue our service.

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:46.090
We have seen that in both big and small challenges, Jehovah takes care of us.

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:53.409
In 2017, when the World Headquarters opened in Warwick, 161 part-time commuters made considerable

00:03:53.409 --> 00:04:02.009
sacrifices in order to extend warm hospitality to the 302,401 visitors.

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:08.090
What motivates brothers and sisters from around the world to make such exceptional sacrifices

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.009
just for the opportunity to serve part-time at Bethel?

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:21.529
Psalm 1103 assures us that Jehovah's people will offer themselves willingly on the day of

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:28.250
His military force, or as the footnote reads, on the day His army mobilizes.

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:33.449
The willing spirit of part-time commuters is certainly commendable.

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:37.970
How does this army of willing volunteers feel about their privilege to assist with the

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:39.689
work at Bethel?

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:42.529
Even on a part-time basis?

00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:47.089
What blessings do they feel they've received by making themselves available to serve in

00:04:47.089 --> 00:04:49.689
this way?

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:56.410
You get to work with lovely brothers and sisters, and the atmosphere is absolutely amazing.

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:02.009
Before coming to Bethel, I was very shy, but coming to Bethel and spending time with brothers

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:09.129
and sisters from different places, cultures, and ages has helped me to be more sociable,

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:17.600
and especially to see them as my family because they've been so kind to me.

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:22.160
One of the things that we really enjoy here is morning worship and the spiritual gems.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:23.680
I like to take notes.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:28.910
I have a notebook with points from almost all of them that we've watched.

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:33.509
Growing up, I didn't know much about Bethel, but I can see that Bethel has become a natural

00:05:33.509 --> 00:05:35.750
part of my daughter's lives.

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:39.550
And now my wife is also thinking about commuting to Bethel.

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:43.350
When you come home from work, you can be stressed out.

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:48.350
When you come home from working at Bethel, you feel uplifted and happy.

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:53.149
I'm so glad that I can continue serving as a pioneer in my congregation because of

00:05:53.149 --> 00:05:55.990
the hour credit I receive from Bethel.

00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:00.629
And now it's great to add variety to my service to Jehovah by combining pioneer service with

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:02.430
serving at Bethel.

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:07.709
One of the blessings that I particularly value and appreciate is to be able to take part

00:06:07.709 --> 00:06:10.709
in the spiritual growth of my family.

00:06:10.709 --> 00:06:14.990
For example, I have a seven-year-old sister.

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:19.189
And she noticed that now I go to work at Bethelmore.

00:06:19.189 --> 00:06:24.279
This has had a great impact on her.

00:06:24.279 --> 00:06:29.560
Actually, I think that her seeing me as an example to follow is the greatest blessing

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:33.920
I've had.

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:41.759
So much is being accomplished by happy and self-sacrificing part-time commuters worldwide.

00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:47.839
The psalmist was inspired to foretell that an army of willing volunteers would provide

00:06:47.839 --> 00:06:52.000
refreshing encouragement to God's people.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Psalm 1103 says,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.600
You have your company of young men and women.

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:02.079
Just like do-drops.

00:07:02.079 --> 00:07:08.240
This vivid word picture would instantly have reminded Israel of the life-sustaining moisture

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:13.439
that descended from lofty Mount Hermann in the north and settled as do-drops in the

00:07:13.439 --> 00:07:18.319
fertile, but arid lowlands of the promised land.

00:07:18.319 --> 00:07:19.879
How well?

00:07:19.879 --> 00:07:25.480
That describes the refreshing effect of the thousands of eager and energetic brothers

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:30.800
and sisters who are choosing to expand their service to Jehovah, including those serving

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:33.560
as part-time commuters.

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:39.639
They offer themselves willingly for the benefit of the worldwide brotherhood and to the

00:07:39.639 --> 00:07:41.680
praise of Jehovah's name.
