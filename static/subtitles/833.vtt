00:00:02.799 --> 00:00:07.799
Planning for the new Patterson Visitors Centre began in 2018.

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.800
A project development group was formed with a goal of starting construction,

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.800
but unforeseen challenges were about to occur.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.800
In March of 2020, an outbreak of COVID-19 in the New York area

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.800
caused Bethel to go into a full lockdown.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.800
How did the design group siege ahova's blessing on the project

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.800
during this unprecedented time?

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.109
Well, when Bethel locked down and suspended in-person meetings,

00:00:37.109 --> 00:00:40.109
so did the town of Patterson.

00:00:40.109 --> 00:00:44.109
This created a serious challenge for us to obtain the necessary approvals

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:47.109
and to keep the project moving forward.

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:50.109
So, with a threat of falling months behind,

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:53.109
we had to rely on Jehova and alter our approach.

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:58.109
So, a local elder was given permission to attend the town planning board meetings

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.109
in person once they opened up.

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:05.109
He allowed us as a design team to make a presentation effectively but remotely.

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:10.109
We saw Jehova's hand and his blessing on this entire arrangement.

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:13.109
So, through months of meetings, we were able to get the approvals needed

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:16.109
and then get a building permit to begin construction

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:22.450
all of this taking place during the lockdown.

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.450
Following all the local guidelines, the branch found a way

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.450
to bring skilled brothers and sisters into the Bethel bubble safely

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.450
so they could work on the project.

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:40.040
Jehova caused many volunteers to offer themselves willingly to help.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.040
Here we are building the Patterson Visitor Center

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:49.040
during a most unique time in history in the midst of a global pandemic.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.040
The Brotherhood has demonstrated a heart for the work.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.040
Through contributions, brothers and sisters offering their skills,

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.040
some of which are quite unique.

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:06.040
It's so encouraging to see how Jehova has come to our aid with supply issues

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:11.039
and how Bethel departments have cooperated and provided skilled people to help us.

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.039
It's been so encouraging.

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:19.039
All involved have seen Jehova's hand guiding the way through these challenging circumstances.

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:24.039
But some may wonder, at a time when guests are not allowed on Bethel property,

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:29.039
why is this Visitor Center so important to Jehova?

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:33.039
The physical buildings at Bethel are attractive.

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:37.039
But what's more valuable to Jehova is what happens inside.

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:44.039
It's the spiritual gift that he has in store for all who come to visit that is so important.

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:48.039
The Patterson Visitor Center is designed to be an immersive,

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:51.039
theocratic experience for everyone.

00:02:51.039 --> 00:03:09.900
The Patterson Visitor Center will feature three museums and a coin display.

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.900
Our feature museum will be a first-century Bible village.

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:26.930
The objective is to educate visitors about what life was like in the first century,

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.930
and thereby bring Bible accounts to life.

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.930
You will get a sense of what things were like when Jesus walked the earth.

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.930
Since the Israelites lived off the land,

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.930
the experience begins with an overview of the annual crop cycles

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:49.930
that form the core of so much of their daily activities.

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.930
Key agricultural tasks such as threshing, winoing, and grinding grain

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:00.659
will be illustrated with interactive displays.

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:06.659
We know you will find the exhibit components like the functioning olive press and wine press,

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:09.659
very interesting and informative.

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:28.449
The next stop will be a typical first-century market.

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:33.449
Here you will see some of the food and goods that would have been available

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:36.449
depending on the season of the year.

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:44.449
We next invite you into the residence and workshop spaces of a typical first-century Israelite family.

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:52.860
The manger, carpentry shop, weaving, and fabric-dying displays

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.860
will illustrate a number of Israelite activities.

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:04.860
The resident's courtyard area will show other regular home tasks like grain grinding and basket making.

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:10.860
We next invite you into a typical Israelite home and out onto a rooftop

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:16.379
overlooking the rest of the village.

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:20.379
Before you leave the residences, you will also see an upper room

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:26.110
that would have been in some of the Israelite homes.

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:32.110
The next area of the first-century Bible village that you can explore is the synagogue,

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:39.740
which was the center of worship and study in the Jewish community.

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:46.740
Next, a functioning pottery wheel in kiln will illustrate how pottery was made.

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:53.740
The last stop will take you to a lakeside where you will be able to board a first-century fishing boat

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:57.740
similar to the one that Jesus and His disciples used.

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:01.740
Here you can learn what was involved in commercial fishing.

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:25.420
This, and so much more, is waiting for you at the new Patterson Visitor Center.

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:33.420
We can't wait for you to come and see the beautiful spiritual gift that is waiting for you.

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:47.699
The new visitor center and museum are on course to be completed in the fall of 2023.

00:06:48.699 --> 00:06:53.699
When will guests be able to come back to Bethlehem and tour the new facility?

00:06:53.699 --> 00:06:56.699
We are going to have to wait and see.

00:06:56.699 --> 00:07:00.699
But one thing is, for sure, when the doors finally do open,

00:07:00.699 --> 00:07:06.699
anyone who makes the effort to come will receive a spiritual gift from Jehovah.

00:07:06.699 --> 00:07:11.699
The touring experience will prove to be a spiritual encouragement to the worldwide Brotherhood

00:07:11.699 --> 00:07:17.699
and promote pure worship to Jehovah's praise and honor in a very unique way.

00:07:17.699 --> 00:07:21.699
It will certainly be a must-see.

00:07:21.699 --> 00:07:26.699
Well, we've seen the blessings on this project and really all the people working hard on it.

00:07:26.699 --> 00:07:30.699
The facility is going to benefit thousands of future visitors.

00:07:30.699 --> 00:07:38.699
It's because all of us, either now or in the New World, need to be taught about the life and ministry of Jesus.

00:07:39.699 --> 00:07:45.699
For this reason, we're convinced of Jehovah's blessing on the project and his desire to have this facility built.

00:07:45.699 --> 00:07:52.699
It's Jehovah's desire that people come to his house and be refreshed and educated.

00:07:52.699 --> 00:07:58.699
It is our prayer that this new and thrilling visitor center will accomplish that.

00:07:58.699 --> 00:08:05.699
Yes, we'll come. They will be up built and they will draw closer to Jehovah God.
