WEBVTT

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:08.220
As Jehovah's people, we enjoy many undeserved and precious privileges.

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:14.619
Among them we bear Jehovah's name and render him sacred service.

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:20.899
As we carry out his will, he dignifies us in a very special way.

00:00:20.899 --> 00:00:28.940
At 1 Corinthians 3.9 the Apostle Paul under inspiration stated that we are God's fellow

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.339
workers.

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:37.979
What an honor to be a fellow worker with the Universal Sovereign, our loving Heavenly Father.

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:42.939
To build appreciation for the privilege of working with Jehovah, we're going to review events

00:00:42.939 --> 00:00:47.740
in the life of Jonathan, son of King Saul.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:56.659
1 Samuel 1445 describes Jonathan when it says, for it was with God that he acted this day.

00:00:56.659 --> 00:01:00.340
What was the background that led to this statement?

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:05.340
How did Jonathan act or work with Jehovah on that day?

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:09.659
What lessons can we learn from their working relationship?

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.930
And what blessings result from being a fellow worker with God?

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.810
Let us begin with some background.

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:26.450
1 Samuel 12 and 20 records the encouraging words spoken by the prophet Samuel to the nation

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.450
of Israel.

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.609
Do not be afraid.

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:36.930
Only do not turn away from following Jehovah and serve Jehovah with all your heart.

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:44.730
Verse 22 adds, for the sake of his great name, Jehovah will not abandon his people.

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:50.769
As long as they remain faithful, Jehovah would always be there to guide, protect, and

00:01:50.769 --> 00:01:53.049
rescue them.

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:57.569
These words no doubt strengthen Jonathan to carry out Jehovah's directive to subdue

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:03.079
the enemy nations and take possession of the Promised Land.

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:10.360
At 1 Samuel 13, we read that Jonathan was assigned 1000 men to attack a Philistine

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.159
garrison at Giebel.

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:18.439
Although poorly equipped, Jonathan and his men succeeded.

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:23.599
This victory strengthens Jonathan's confidence in Jehovah and provides a valuable lesson

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:25.960
for us.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:31.960
While we gain strength and courage from Jehovah's reassuring words in the scriptures, our confidence

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:37.840
in Jehovah's support becomes even stronger when we successfully carry out our assignments

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.659
that may seem overwhelming.

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:47.020
The account then relates how the Philistines were infuriated over their defeat and mounted

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.740
a massive counterattack.

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:54.939
They sent out raiding parties from their account at McMash near Jerusalem.

00:02:54.939 --> 00:03:01.819
Many as light men hid out of fear, and some even fled to the other side of the Jordan River.

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:06.780
In contrast, Jonathan remained courageous.

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:12.900
Permen to put a stop to the raids, he confronted the Philistine outpost at the ravine pass

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.219
of McMash.

00:03:15.219 --> 00:03:20.900
The approach was by way of a deep gorge with nearly vertical cliffs.

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:26.460
This would have seen next to impossible to someone unfamiliar with the area, but Jonathan

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:32.000
grew up in this territory and apparently knew it well.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.960
His knowledge of the surroundings provides another practical lesson.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:41.919
Whatever theocratic assignment we may be given, putting forth time and effort to get

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:47.759
to know that the terrain, so to speak, will contribute to our effectiveness.

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:52.240
When we show interest in our assigned work, we become even more effective fellow workers

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:55.180
of Jehovah.

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:00.990
Let's read as Jonathan prepares to take action against the Philistines.

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:05.990
First Samuel 146 states, so Jonathan said to his armor bearer,

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:11.750
come and let us cross over to the outpost of these uncircumcised men.

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.349
Perhaps Jehovah will act in our behalf.

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:19.790
For nothing can hinder Jehovah from saving by many or by few.

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:23.629
What contributed to his confidence in Jehovah?

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:29.069
Recall that he put faith in Jehovah's reassuring words to the prophet Samuel.

00:04:29.069 --> 00:04:31.069
Do not be afraid.

00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:37.189
For the sake of his great name, Jehovah will not abandon his people.

00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:43.790
He experienced Jehovah's support when he struck down the Philistine garrison at Giba.

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:47.629
Jonathan could also think back on Israel's history.

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:56.069
He could reflect on how Gideon and his 300 men were victorious over 135,000 Mideonites.

00:04:56.069 --> 00:05:04.149
He could meditate on Samson killing 1,000 Philistines with the jawbone of a donkey.

00:05:04.149 --> 00:05:09.629
Such examples would bolster his confidence that he was working with the Almighty God,

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:12.560
Jehovah.

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:17.439
We too can meditate on fellow workers of God recorded in the scriptures, as well as

00:05:17.439 --> 00:05:22.199
published life stories of modern-day faithful servants.

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:29.850
Such examples reinforce our faith in Jehovah as we rely on him for success.

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:36.569
Another lesson comes from the response of Jonathan's armor bearer at 1 Samuel 147.

00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:39.370
At this, his armor bearer said to him,

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:42.689
Do whatever your heart impels you to do.

00:05:42.689 --> 00:05:48.810
Turn wherever you wish, and I will follow you wherever your heart impels you.

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:55.329
It is unlikely that the attendant would have initiated this challenging mission on his own.

00:05:55.329 --> 00:06:01.540
Jonathan's confident lead was a positive motivating influence on the man.

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:07.220
What happens today when elders and overseers take the lead and display zeal in Jehovah's

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:10.180
work like Jonathan?

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:16.959
Others in the congregation are also motivated to action by their fine example.

00:06:16.959 --> 00:06:20.399
Let us now read verses 8-10.

00:06:20.399 --> 00:06:22.399
When Jonathan said,

00:06:22.399 --> 00:06:27.360
We will cross over to those men and reveal our presence to them.

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:28.680
If they say to us,

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.639
Stand still until we come to you,

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:35.199
We will stand where we are and not go up to them.

00:06:35.199 --> 00:06:36.519
But if they say,

00:06:36.519 --> 00:06:38.319
Come up against us,

00:06:38.319 --> 00:06:40.120
We will go up,

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:43.240
Because Jehovah will give them into our hand.

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.839
This will be our sign.

00:06:45.839 --> 00:06:50.720
Jonathan once again demonstrated humble reliance on Jehovah.

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:52.839
Earlier in Samuel's account,

00:06:52.839 --> 00:06:54.480
Jonathan is described as

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:58.879
Swifter than Eagles and mightier than the Lions.

00:06:58.879 --> 00:07:00.120
However,

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:06.839
These qualities and abilities did not cause him to be self-reliant or overconfident.

00:07:06.839 --> 00:07:12.060
He sought Jehovah's direction by means of a sign.

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:15.180
What a powerful reminder for us.

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:21.100
Regardless of any natural abilities, acquired skills or experience we may have,

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:26.339
The key to success is seeking Jehovah's guidance and support.

00:07:26.339 --> 00:07:29.899
We seek his direction through specific prayers,

00:07:29.899 --> 00:07:32.779
Bible reading and meditation,

00:07:32.779 --> 00:07:37.300
And applying direction from the faithful and discrete slave.

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:40.740
We also consult with longtime faithful brothers and sisters

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:49.540
who can share their rich experience as God's fellow workers.

00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:53.899
What else can we learn from Jonathan's account?

00:07:53.899 --> 00:07:58.220
Picking up at 1 Samuel 1412,

00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:00.379
Jonathan and his armor bearer

00:08:00.379 --> 00:08:03.379
advanced toward the Philistines.

00:08:03.379 --> 00:08:05.500
From their elevated location,

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:07.939
the Philistines shout to them.

00:08:07.939 --> 00:08:11.899
Come up to us and we will teach you a lesson.

00:08:11.899 --> 00:08:14.899
At once, Jonathan said to his armor bearer,

00:08:14.939 --> 00:08:20.500
follow me, for Jehovah will give them into the hand of Israel.

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:25.379
Jonathan had requested a specific sign, and he got it.

00:08:25.379 --> 00:08:32.220
But it meant advancing up a steep and treacherous incline right into the enemy hands.

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:36.139
Someone lacking complete trust in Jehovah might have said,

00:08:36.139 --> 00:08:38.179
before proceeding,

00:08:38.179 --> 00:08:41.100
perhaps we should ask for another sign,

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:42.940
but not Jonathan.

00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:46.620
Without hesitation, he told his attendant to follow him

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:50.980
because Jehovah would give the enemy into their hand.

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:53.340
When we received Jehovah's direction,

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:57.179
we should without hesitation put our hearts into the work,

00:08:57.179 --> 00:09:00.850
confident of Jehovah's backing.

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:03.129
What happened next?

00:09:03.129 --> 00:09:08.450
1 Samuel 14, 13 and 14 reports,

00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:12.049
and Jonathan climbed up on his hands and feet,

00:09:12.049 --> 00:09:15.090
and his armor bearer was behind him.

00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:18.250
And the Philistines began to fall before Jonathan,

00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:21.970
and his armor bearer was putting them to death behind him.

00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:25.610
In the first attack that Jonathan and his armor bearer made,

00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:28.889
they struck down about 20 men.

00:09:28.889 --> 00:09:34.370
Even after receiving a clear sign from Jehovah, it took great effort.

00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:37.450
They had to climb up on their hands and feet,

00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:42.330
exerting themselves vigorously over rugged terrain.

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:44.009
The lesson?

00:09:44.009 --> 00:09:48.809
Even when we receive clear direction and are ready to obey,

00:09:48.809 --> 00:09:53.090
caring out our assignments will not always be easy.

00:09:53.090 --> 00:09:55.529
We have to exert ourselves vigorously,

00:09:55.529 --> 00:10:02.159
being willing to work hard with all of our mind, heart, and strength.

00:10:02.159 --> 00:10:07.000
How did the Philistines react to seeing Jehovah's support for his people?

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.279
1 Samuel 14, 15 reads,

00:10:10.279 --> 00:10:15.559
then terror spread in the Phil camp and among all the people of the outpost,

00:10:15.559 --> 00:10:18.759
and even the raiding parties were terrified.

00:10:18.759 --> 00:10:24.120
The earth began quaking and a terror from God ensued.

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:29.000
The earthquake Jehovah caused melted the Philistines' hearts.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.000
Soon the Israelites, even those who had previously fled in fear,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.080
joined the victory battle over the Philistines.

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:41.600
Likewise, when we put our hearts into theocratic assignments,

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:45.200
Jehovah, our best fellow worker,

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:51.240
will always come through with whatever we need to accomplish his will.

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:56.080
But there's another lesson to be learned from this exciting Bible account.

00:10:56.080 --> 00:11:02.080
During the height of the battle, King Saul gave an unwise order, saying,

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:05.840
cursed is the man who eats any food before the evening

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:10.279
and until I have taken vengeance on my enemies.

00:11:10.279 --> 00:11:14.480
Jonathan, however, was not aware of his father's order

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:18.360
and ate some wild honey that he had found.

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:25.000
How did Saul react when he discovered that his own son had disobeyed him?

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.200
1 Samuel 14, 43, and 44 tells us,

00:11:30.279 --> 00:11:32.600
then Saul said to Jonathan,

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:35.879
tell me, what have you done?

00:11:35.879 --> 00:11:38.120
So Jonathan told him,

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:43.360
I merely tasted a little honey on the tip of the staff in my hand.

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:47.039
Here I am, I am ready to die.

00:11:47.039 --> 00:11:49.000
At this Saul said,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:55.080
thus may God do and may he add to it if you do not die, Jonathan.

00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:58.440
Imagine, after all that Jonathan had done

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:01.639
in risking his life and behalf of his people

00:12:01.639 --> 00:12:05.240
and seeing Jehovah grant so much success,

00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:10.159
he is now being condemned to death by his own father.

00:12:10.159 --> 00:12:18.519
How his heart must have sank in disbelief, disappointment, and sadness?

00:12:18.519 --> 00:12:22.679
Would Jehovah now abandon his loyal fellow worker?

00:12:22.679 --> 00:12:26.480
1 Samuel 14, 45 reads,

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:29.080
but the people said to Saul,

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:31.159
should Jonathan die?

00:12:31.159 --> 00:12:34.399
The one who brought this great victory to Israel?

00:12:34.399 --> 00:12:36.279
It is unthinkable,

00:12:36.279 --> 00:12:38.440
as surely as Jehovah is alive,

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:41.879
not even a single hair of his head should fall to the ground,

00:12:41.879 --> 00:12:46.600
for it was with God that he acted this day.

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:52.080
With that, the people rescued Jonathan, and he did not die.

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:56.000
Jonathan's success provided undeniable evidence

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.559
that he was truly Jehovah's fellow worker.

00:12:59.559 --> 00:13:03.639
Jehovah, who had been at Jonathan's side the whole time,

00:13:03.639 --> 00:13:06.000
saw everything that had happened

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:11.720
and would not allow his loyal worker to die at Saul's hands.

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:16.200
How comforting to know that when we faithfully carry out our assignments,

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:19.840
he will never forget our zealous efforts.

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:26.200
If someone as close as a father fails to see and appreciate the work we do in Jehovah's service,

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:28.639
or even turns against us,

00:13:28.639 --> 00:13:31.639
Jehovah will never forget our work.

00:13:31.639 --> 00:13:39.480
He will always be there to guide, support, protect, and bless us.

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:45.480
What a faith-building account we've considered in 1 Samuel 13 and 14.

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:49.600
Why not take the time to read these chapters for yourself?

00:13:49.639 --> 00:13:57.519
You'll be moved to imitate Jonathan's excellent example of loyalty, courage, and obedience.

00:13:57.519 --> 00:14:02.679
We want to be described just as Jonathan was at 1 Samuel 14, 45,

00:14:02.679 --> 00:14:07.360
for it was with God that he acted this day.

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:10.960
By continuing as industrious fellow workers with Jehovah,

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:14.080
we are assured that through faith and patience,

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:17.440
we will inherit the promise reward.
