00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:30.539
Welcome to the fifth session of our Pursue Peace Convention, which corresponds to the Sunday morning session on your program.

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.539
Our music video presentation is about to begin.

00:00:34.539 --> 00:00:39.539
As you watch, please notice how pursuing peace with God brings great happiness.

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:42.539
Please enjoy the presentation.

00:10:32.419 --> 00:10:34.419
Greetings brothers and sisters.

00:10:34.419 --> 00:10:42.419
What's your theme for this session and the next is taken from the inspired words found in Romans 15, verse 13, which says in part,

00:10:42.419 --> 00:10:48.419
May the God who gives hope, fill you with all joy and peace.

00:10:48.419 --> 00:10:54.419
We invite all to sing song number 101, working together in unity.

00:10:54.419 --> 00:12:55.129
Again, that's song number 101.

00:12:55.129 --> 00:13:01.129
Sometimes specific challenges can make it difficult for servants of Jehovah to pursue peace.

00:13:01.129 --> 00:13:05.129
What are these challenges and how can we overcome them?

00:13:05.129 --> 00:13:09.129
These questions will be answered in a seven-part symposium.

00:13:09.129 --> 00:13:18.129
We will consider how we can imitate the examples of those who reaped peace after first sowing it.

00:13:18.129 --> 00:13:26.129
To begin, let's give our attention to brother William Turner, a helper to this service committee as he presents the talk.

00:13:26.129 --> 00:13:40.649
How they sowed and reaped peace. Joseph and his brothers.

00:13:40.649 --> 00:13:47.649
The Bible contains many fundamental principles that a Christian can use every day to guide his life.

00:13:47.649 --> 00:13:56.649
For example, at Proverbs chapter 13 verse 20, we're told that if we walk with wise persons, we will become wise.

00:13:56.649 --> 00:14:02.649
Proverbs 28 states that if we're faithful, we will receive many blessings.

00:14:02.649 --> 00:14:07.649
Likely, you have Bible principles that you live by as well.

00:14:07.649 --> 00:14:16.649
However, as it pertains to pursuing peace, there is one essential principle that must be followed.

00:14:17.649 --> 00:14:19.649
Let's find out what it is.

00:14:19.649 --> 00:14:24.789
Turn with me please to Galatians chapter 6.

00:14:24.789 --> 00:14:33.259
And let's read the words of Galatians chapter 6 verses 7 and 8.

00:14:33.259 --> 00:14:35.259
Here we read,

00:14:35.259 --> 00:14:38.259
Do not be misled.

00:14:38.259 --> 00:14:40.259
God is not one to be mocked.

00:14:40.259 --> 00:14:45.259
For whatever a person is sowing, this he will also reap.

00:14:45.259 --> 00:14:51.259
Because the one sowing with a view to his flesh will reap corruption from his flesh.

00:14:51.259 --> 00:14:58.259
But the one sowing with a view to the spirit will reap everlasting life from the spirit.

00:14:58.259 --> 00:15:00.259
So the principle?

00:15:00.259 --> 00:15:04.259
We reap what we sow.

00:15:04.259 --> 00:15:06.259
You might think of a farmer.

00:15:06.259 --> 00:15:10.259
He knows that he must plant what he hopes to reap.

00:15:10.259 --> 00:15:14.259
He also knows that he will not reap fruitage right away.

00:15:14.259 --> 00:15:19.259
But he trusts that results will come in due time.

00:15:19.259 --> 00:15:22.259
It is similar with the quality of peace.

00:15:22.259 --> 00:15:27.259
The only way for us to reap peace is to sow it.

00:15:27.259 --> 00:15:35.259
And as we put in the work to achieve it, we trust that in due time, we will reap the benefits.

00:15:36.259 --> 00:15:42.259
In this symposium, we will consider viable and modern day accounts of how Jehovah s people,

00:15:42.259 --> 00:15:49.259
despite particular challenges, have reaped peace after first sowing it.

00:15:49.259 --> 00:15:55.259
Now one particular challenge to gaining peace is problems within the family.

00:15:55.259 --> 00:16:03.259
Because of imperfection, it s not uncommon to have disagreements, even tension from time to time.

00:16:03.259 --> 00:16:07.259
And family members may hurt one another in various ways.

00:16:07.259 --> 00:16:10.259
And usually such offenses are minor.

00:16:10.259 --> 00:16:13.259
And peace can quickly be sown and reaped.

00:16:13.259 --> 00:16:18.600
But what if the offense is more serious?

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:24.600
A family member says or does something that hurts us deeply.

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:32.600
Well, even then, it still may be possible to sow and reap peace.

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:38.600
We can prove this by considering the Bible account of Joseph and his brothers.

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:40.600
And we are familiar with the story.

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:44.600
Out of envy, Joseph s brothers sold him into slavery.

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:47.600
And this was by no means a minor offense.

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:50.600
It began with Joseph being led to Egypt.

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:54.600
Sometime later, he was falsely accused and thrown into prison.

00:16:54.600 --> 00:17:03.600
So for 13 years, Joseph suffered his treatment when he had done nothing to deserve it.

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:09.599
Now it could have been very easy for Joseph to feel that if he ever saw his brothers again,

00:17:09.599 --> 00:17:15.599
the best option for peace would be not to have any dealings with them at all.

00:17:15.599 --> 00:17:18.599
Perhaps we might feel the same way as well.

00:17:18.599 --> 00:17:21.599
But Joseph didn t do that.

00:17:21.599 --> 00:17:27.599
In fact, after some years passed, both Joseph and his brothers sold peace.

00:17:27.599 --> 00:17:29.599
Now note how this was done.

00:17:29.599 --> 00:17:40.609
Turn with me please to the 105th Psalm and note the 19th verse of Psalm 105.

00:17:40.609 --> 00:17:47.650
It says, until the time that his word proved true,

00:17:47.650 --> 00:17:52.650
the saying of Jehovah is what refined him.

00:17:52.650 --> 00:18:02.279
Joseph trusted in Jehovah to refine him, to shape his thinking and godly qualities.

00:18:02.279 --> 00:18:05.279
He refused to become bitter.

00:18:05.279 --> 00:18:10.279
In fact, how interesting it is to note that there is nothing in the scriptures to indicate

00:18:10.279 --> 00:18:15.279
that Joseph ever told anyone, not even Pharaoh,

00:18:15.279 --> 00:18:21.279
that his brothers were the ones who kidnapped him and sold him as a slave.

00:18:22.279 --> 00:18:24.279
And how about Joseph s brothers?

00:18:24.279 --> 00:18:28.279
Years after they had mistreated him, they met Joseph in Egypt.

00:18:28.279 --> 00:18:33.279
When Joseph tested them by giving the youngest brother Benjamin significantly more attention

00:18:33.279 --> 00:18:38.279
than he gave the others, he saw his brothers had changed.

00:18:38.279 --> 00:18:42.279
They had let go of envy.

00:18:42.279 --> 00:18:47.279
They showed genuine concern for their brother and for their father Jacob.

00:18:47.279 --> 00:18:53.279
Joseph realized that his brothers were repentant and he forgave them.

00:18:53.279 --> 00:18:58.279
And because Joseph and his brothers were willing to take steps to sow peace,

00:18:58.279 --> 00:19:06.279
they reaped the benefits and eventually were able to enjoy a harmonious relationship.

00:19:06.279 --> 00:19:13.069
Well, how can the example of Joseph and his brothers help us today?

00:19:13.069 --> 00:19:26.500
In the following dramatization, notice how a family member sows peace.

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:39.200
Every morning, and I mean every morning, there's Jeremy singing at the top of his lungs.

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:41.200
Okay, I wasn't the only one.

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:43.200
No, but you were the loudest.

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:46.200
Spoken like a true big brother.

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:51.200
I was always impressed with how close you two were.

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:56.200
Well, it wasn't always that way.

00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:58.200
No.

00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:01.200
I mean, it started out that way.

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:04.200
Nick and I, we weren't just brothers.

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:07.670
We were friends.

00:20:07.670 --> 00:20:10.670
But then the family business ran into trouble.

00:20:10.670 --> 00:20:17.500
And what started as a small disagreement just exploded.

00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:19.500
How are business works?

00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:22.500
Instead of criticizing, could you just once?

00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:26.779
Jeremy!

00:20:26.779 --> 00:20:29.779
Do you have any idea what this is going to cost us?

00:20:29.779 --> 00:20:31.779
I didn't have a choice. You went behind my back.

00:20:31.779 --> 00:20:34.779
What's your problem?

00:20:34.779 --> 00:20:36.779
You, you're the problem.

00:20:36.779 --> 00:20:50.579
We tried to work it out.

00:20:50.579 --> 00:20:55.460
But things just got worse.

00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:58.460
It was like a door slam shut between us.

00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:01.460
On the outside, I acted like everything was fine.

00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:14.230
But inside, I couldn't let it go.

00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:40.410
I felt like a total hypocrite and that had to change.

00:21:40.410 --> 00:21:46.410
I needed a lot of help from Jehovah to let go,

00:21:46.410 --> 00:21:56.359
to move on and make things right with Nick.

00:21:56.359 --> 00:22:01.109
It took a long time for the wounds to heal.

00:22:01.109 --> 00:22:11.670
And for us to trust each other, the way we used to.

00:22:11.670 --> 00:22:20.450
But we did.

00:22:20.450 --> 00:22:33.960
I'm so grateful that we made peace before the world turned upside down.

00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:37.960
So how can you and I imitate Joseph and his brothers?

00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:40.960
Let's discuss three steps.

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:46.960
The first step is found in Ephesians chapter 4, verse 32.

00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:48.960
Let's read that.

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:52.960
Ephesians 4, verse 32.

00:22:52.960 --> 00:23:00.099
But become kind to one another, tenderly compassionate,

00:23:00.099 --> 00:23:04.099
freely forgiving one another, just as God also by Christ,

00:23:04.099 --> 00:23:08.099
freely forgave you.

00:23:08.099 --> 00:23:13.099
So first, we must be ready to forgive.

00:23:13.099 --> 00:23:18.099
If we like grievances and resentment build up and develop in our hearts,

00:23:18.099 --> 00:23:22.099
it becomes even more difficult to be forgiving.

00:23:22.099 --> 00:23:26.099
Did you note in the video what started as a small disagreement

00:23:26.099 --> 00:23:31.099
between Nick and Jeremy exploded into something much bigger?

00:23:31.099 --> 00:23:33.099
Why?

00:23:33.099 --> 00:23:39.099
Jeremy could not let go of his resentment towards his brother.

00:23:39.099 --> 00:23:42.099
We must work to treat others in a forgiving way,

00:23:42.099 --> 00:23:45.099
just as Jehovah treats us.

00:23:46.509 --> 00:23:52.509
The second step, don't dwell on the offense.

00:23:52.509 --> 00:23:54.509
Proverbs 17 and 9 says,

00:23:54.509 --> 00:23:59.509
the one who keeps harping on a matter separates close friends.

00:23:59.509 --> 00:24:03.509
And isn't that how Jeremy described the relationship with his brother?

00:24:03.509 --> 00:24:07.509
It was a door slam shut between them.

00:24:07.509 --> 00:24:10.509
It wasn't until steps were taken to so peace,

00:24:10.509 --> 00:24:14.509
having that open, honest communication with each other,

00:24:14.509 --> 00:24:17.509
spending time together, working with each other in the ministry.

00:24:17.509 --> 00:24:22.509
Only then did things start to improve.

00:24:22.509 --> 00:24:24.509
And did you notice?

00:24:24.509 --> 00:24:28.509
Everything did not go back to normal right away.

00:24:28.509 --> 00:24:32.509
It took time to read peace.

00:24:32.509 --> 00:24:35.509
Time for those wounds to heal.

00:24:35.509 --> 00:24:38.509
Time to regain lost trust,

00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:42.920
so we can't look for miracles.

00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:46.920
But we should look for progress.

00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:49.920
Like the farmer, trust that.

00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:54.920
In new time, we will see results from our efforts.

00:24:54.920 --> 00:25:00.549
And here's where the all-important third step comes in.

00:25:00.549 --> 00:25:06.549
Ask Jehovah in prayer to help us to let go of resentment.

00:25:06.549 --> 00:25:09.549
Remember Psalm 105, 19?

00:25:09.549 --> 00:25:13.549
It was the sayings of Jehovah that helped refine Joseph

00:25:13.549 --> 00:25:16.549
to develop the qualities needed not to become bitter

00:25:16.549 --> 00:25:19.549
and to let go of any resentment.

00:25:19.549 --> 00:25:24.549
In the video, Jeremy acknowledged that he needed Jehovah's help,

00:25:24.549 --> 00:25:28.549
to let go and to move on.

00:25:28.549 --> 00:25:33.119
And Jehovah can do the same for us.

00:25:33.119 --> 00:25:35.119
It's not easy when we go through situations

00:25:35.119 --> 00:25:38.119
that threaten the peace of our family.

00:25:38.119 --> 00:25:41.119
But if we live by this fundamental principle,

00:25:41.119 --> 00:25:44.119
we reap what we sow.

00:25:44.119 --> 00:25:47.119
Then we can be assured that with the forgiving spirit,

00:25:47.119 --> 00:25:50.119
looking for opportunities to sow peace,

00:25:50.119 --> 00:25:53.119
and be seeking Jehovah for his help,

00:25:53.119 --> 00:25:55.119
that our efforts will be blessed.

00:25:55.119 --> 00:25:57.119
And in due time,

00:25:57.119 --> 00:26:00.119
we and our family can reap the benefits

00:26:00.119 --> 00:26:04.430
and enjoy true peace.

00:26:04.430 --> 00:26:07.430
For the Ronald Curzon, a helper to the Teaching Committee,

00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:10.430
will now present the next talk of this symposium,

00:26:10.430 --> 00:26:23.140
how they sowed and reaped peace to give you a nice.

00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:26.140
There is a battle that has lasted for centuries

00:26:26.140 --> 00:26:29.140
and continues down to our day.

00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:31.140
It's a battle of wills,

00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:35.140
the will of disobedient humans who fight against Jehovah's will.

00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:38.140
Rather than submitting or surrendering their will

00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:40.140
to do Jehovah's will,

00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:43.140
most humans refuse to make peace with him,

00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:46.140
becoming peace-breakers.

00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:48.140
On the other hand,

00:26:48.140 --> 00:26:50.140
millions throughout the centuries

00:26:50.140 --> 00:26:52.140
have humbly submitted to Jehovah's will,

00:26:52.140 --> 00:26:55.140
making his will their will,

00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:59.140
they are known as peace-makers.

00:26:59.140 --> 00:27:01.140
By sowing peace with Jehovah,

00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:03.140
they have reaped the benefits

00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:06.140
of having a close personal friendship with him,

00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:09.140
and the wonderful hope of living forever

00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:12.140
in a peaceful new world.

00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:14.140
Even so, we must admit,

00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:17.140
it can be difficult at times to accept

00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:20.140
and then follow Jehovah's direction,

00:27:20.140 --> 00:27:24.140
or direction that we may receive from his organization,

00:27:24.140 --> 00:27:27.140
especially if we don't understand the reasons

00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:29.140
behind the direction,

00:27:29.140 --> 00:27:32.140
or it's not what we might prefer.

00:27:32.140 --> 00:27:36.140
What is needed to sow and reap peace?

00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:38.140
Humility.

00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:41.140
Humility is defined as a lowliness of mind,

00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:44.140
freedom from pride or arrogance.

00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:47.140
A humble person is not self-willed,

00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:50.140
but they actively look for ways to sow peace

00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:53.140
with Jehovah and others.

00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:56.140
He's known as a peacemaker.

00:27:56.140 --> 00:28:01.140
What is the result of humility and sowing peace?

00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:05.140
Notice what Proverbs 22 in verse 4 says.

00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:09.140
The result of humility and the fear of Jehovah is

00:28:09.140 --> 00:28:14.140
reaping notice riches and glory and life.

00:28:14.140 --> 00:28:17.140
Yes, everlasting life.

00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:20.140
The Bible contains many fine examples

00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:22.140
of those who sowed and reaped peace

00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:26.140
by humbly submitting to Jehovah's will.

00:28:26.140 --> 00:28:29.140
Let's consider the example of the Ghibbia Knights.

00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:32.140
The Ghibbia Knights weren't they enemies

00:28:32.140 --> 00:28:34.140
of the Israelites?

00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:35.140
Yes.

00:28:35.140 --> 00:28:38.140
So how did they humbly sow and reap peace with Jehovah

00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:41.140
and with his people?

00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:44.140
As you recall, after Joshua led the Israelites

00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:47.140
across the Jordan River into the Promised Land,

00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:49.140
Jehovah directed them to remove

00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:52.140
the pagan Canaanite nations who dwelt there.

00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:56.140
This included the Ghibbia Knights.

00:28:56.140 --> 00:28:59.140
The account that Joshua 9 informs us

00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:02.140
that the Ghibbia Knights were plainly told

00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:05.140
that it was Jehovah's will that the Canaanites

00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:07.140
be annihilated.

00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:11.140
Israel's stunning victories over Jericho and AI

00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:15.140
made it very clear that Jehovah was fighting for his people.

00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:18.140
And the Ghibbia Knights did not want to be next.

00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:23.140
But what could they do if this was Jehovah's will?

00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:26.140
Well, they devised an interesting plan.

00:29:26.140 --> 00:29:28.140
They sent representatives to seek peace

00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:32.140
with the Israelites and thereby with Jehovah.

00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:34.140
According to verse 11,

00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:37.579
they were instructed,

00:29:37.579 --> 00:29:39.579
we will be your servants.

00:29:39.579 --> 00:29:42.579
Now make a covenant with us.

00:29:42.579 --> 00:29:45.579
So this is what they were to say as representatives.

00:29:45.579 --> 00:29:49.579
Verse 4 says that the Ghibbia Knights acted shrewdly

00:29:49.579 --> 00:29:51.579
by trying to trick the Israelites

00:29:51.579 --> 00:29:54.579
with their worn out clothing and provisions,

00:29:54.579 --> 00:29:56.579
pretending that they had traveled

00:29:56.579 --> 00:29:58.579
from a very distant land,

00:29:58.579 --> 00:30:01.579
but were actually just 20 miles away.

00:30:01.579 --> 00:30:03.579
Did their plan work?

00:30:03.579 --> 00:30:06.579
Despite their deception, yes,

00:30:06.579 --> 00:30:08.579
their plan was successful.

00:30:08.579 --> 00:30:10.579
In fact, in verse 15,

00:30:10.579 --> 00:30:14.579
Joshua made a covenant of peace with the Ghibbia Knights.

00:30:14.579 --> 00:30:18.579
Evidently, this was in harmony with Jehovah's will

00:30:18.579 --> 00:30:21.579
and reflected their humility and desire

00:30:21.579 --> 00:30:24.579
to seek peace with him and his people.

00:30:24.579 --> 00:30:27.579
They demonstrated their humility and submission

00:30:27.579 --> 00:30:31.579
to Jehovah's will and his representative, Joshua,

00:30:31.579 --> 00:30:35.579
by following whatever direction they received.

00:30:35.579 --> 00:30:38.579
In fact, notice the direction in verse 27.

00:30:38.579 --> 00:30:41.579
It says, Joshua made them gatherers of wood

00:30:41.579 --> 00:30:44.579
and drawers of water for the assembly

00:30:44.579 --> 00:30:47.579
and for Jehovah's altar.

00:30:47.579 --> 00:30:51.579
Although the Ghibbia Knight men were likely skilled warriors,

00:30:51.579 --> 00:30:53.579
they were happy and content

00:30:53.579 --> 00:30:56.579
to do whatever work they were given

00:30:56.579 --> 00:30:58.579
to support pure worship.

00:30:58.579 --> 00:31:02.579
Humbly following direction saved their lives

00:31:02.579 --> 00:31:05.579
and brought them peace.

00:31:05.579 --> 00:31:09.579
How can we imitate the Ghibbia Knights?

00:31:09.579 --> 00:31:13.579
By bringing our lives into harmony with Jehovah's will.

00:31:14.579 --> 00:31:17.579
For some, this may require making big changes,

00:31:17.579 --> 00:31:19.579
adjusting their thinking,

00:31:19.579 --> 00:31:21.579
giving up harmful practices

00:31:21.579 --> 00:31:24.579
and avoiding bad associates.

00:31:24.579 --> 00:31:27.579
We can also imitate the Ghibbia Knights by being willing

00:31:27.579 --> 00:31:31.579
to perform whatever assignments we are given,

00:31:31.579 --> 00:31:34.579
humbly to support pure worship.

00:31:34.579 --> 00:31:36.579
So the lesson is clear.

00:31:36.579 --> 00:31:42.579
Sewing and reaping peace requires humbly following direction.

00:31:42.579 --> 00:31:46.579
This lesson is highlighted in the following dramatization.

00:31:46.579 --> 00:31:49.579
Notice the benefits of submitting to Jehovah's direction.

00:31:49.579 --> 00:31:58.910
You see,

00:31:58.910 --> 00:32:05.259
pandemic lasted longer than any of us expected.

00:32:05.259 --> 00:32:07.259
In all the conflicting news reports,

00:32:07.259 --> 00:32:10.259
just added to the stress.

00:32:10.259 --> 00:32:12.259
Then my sister lost her job

00:32:12.259 --> 00:32:15.539
and had to move in with us.

00:32:15.539 --> 00:32:16.539
So yeah,

00:32:16.539 --> 00:32:19.539
it was me and Kelly,

00:32:19.539 --> 00:32:22.539
Nicole and Dad.

00:32:22.539 --> 00:32:24.539
Twenty seconds, son.

00:32:24.539 --> 00:32:26.539
Twenty seconds.

00:32:26.539 --> 00:32:39.059
Where's your mask?

00:32:39.059 --> 00:32:40.059
Don't worry.

00:32:40.059 --> 00:32:41.059
Here.

00:32:41.059 --> 00:32:42.059
You can use this one.

00:32:42.059 --> 00:32:44.059
I won't get near anyone.

00:32:44.059 --> 00:32:46.059
Gary.

00:32:46.059 --> 00:32:47.059
Listen.

00:32:47.059 --> 00:32:50.059
Nobody at the warehouse is wearing masks.

00:32:50.059 --> 00:32:53.059
And do you know how many people have actually gotten sick?

00:32:53.059 --> 00:32:54.059
Zero.

00:32:54.059 --> 00:32:56.059
So far,

00:32:56.059 --> 00:32:59.059
you saw the last governing body update.

00:32:59.059 --> 00:33:01.059
We can't let down our guard.

00:33:01.059 --> 00:33:02.059
Not now.

00:33:02.059 --> 00:33:03.059
Dad,

00:33:03.059 --> 00:33:04.059
I get it.

00:33:04.059 --> 00:33:06.660
Okay?

00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:07.660
Look,

00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:10.660
I think it's great that the brothers are trying to keep us safe.

00:33:10.660 --> 00:33:11.660
But...

00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:14.660
But what?

00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:18.660
Don't you think that they're, you know, overreacting?

00:33:18.660 --> 00:33:35.740
But of course,

00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:41.710
it wasn't the brothers who had the problem.

00:33:41.710 --> 00:33:42.710
It was me.

00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:46.180
A week later,

00:33:46.180 --> 00:33:48.180
I found out that a friend in our service group

00:33:48.180 --> 00:33:51.180
was in the hospital with COVID-19.

00:33:51.180 --> 00:33:53.549
He was young.

00:33:53.549 --> 00:33:55.549
And he'd been taking all the rape precautions.

00:33:55.549 --> 00:34:06.259
I had really let my guard down.

00:34:06.259 --> 00:34:10.260
Oh, it's not the time to slacken our hand

00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:13.260
when it comes to safety.

00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:16.260
Don't let your guard down.

00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:20.260
Don't think the virus can't affect you or your family.

00:34:20.260 --> 00:34:23.579
I saw how the organization

00:34:23.579 --> 00:34:26.579
was really trying to protect us.

00:34:26.579 --> 00:34:32.619
And how much my decisions were affecting others,

00:34:32.619 --> 00:34:38.250
including the people I love the most.

00:34:38.250 --> 00:34:40.250
As the pandemic dragged on,

00:34:40.250 --> 00:34:48.949
I learned the importance of being humble and obedient.

00:34:48.949 --> 00:34:50.949
Following Jehovah's direction

00:34:50.949 --> 00:34:52.949
didn't just help us stay safe.

00:34:52.949 --> 00:34:58.760
It brought us peace.

00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:11.059
What timely lessons, especially with all that we are facing today?

00:35:11.059 --> 00:35:12.059
Like Gary,

00:35:12.059 --> 00:35:15.059
there are times that we may need to adjust our thinking

00:35:15.059 --> 00:35:19.059
on matters and put aside our personal opinions and preferences

00:35:19.059 --> 00:35:23.059
so we can loyally and humbly follow Jehovah's direction.

00:35:23.059 --> 00:35:26.059
Or whatever direction we receive

00:35:26.059 --> 00:35:28.059
from his representatives,

00:35:28.059 --> 00:35:31.059
the faithful and discreet slave.

00:35:31.059 --> 00:35:33.059
Gary learned an important lesson.

00:35:33.059 --> 00:35:35.059
Humbly following direction

00:35:35.059 --> 00:35:38.059
doesn't just help our family stay safe.

00:35:38.059 --> 00:35:41.059
It brings us happiness and peace.

00:35:41.059 --> 00:35:45.059
A vital lesson for us today.

00:35:45.059 --> 00:35:48.059
What can help us to humbly follow direction now,

00:35:48.059 --> 00:35:50.059
as well as in the future?

00:35:50.059 --> 00:35:57.059
Note what the Apostle Paul said at Ephesians chapter 5 and verse 17.

00:35:57.059 --> 00:35:58.059
He says,

00:35:58.059 --> 00:36:00.059
stop being unreasonable,

00:36:00.059 --> 00:36:07.059
but keep perceiving what the will of Jehovah is.

00:36:07.059 --> 00:36:09.059
The Bible clearly shows

00:36:09.059 --> 00:36:11.059
God's thinking on matters.

00:36:11.059 --> 00:36:14.059
But what if it's not so clear to us?

00:36:14.059 --> 00:36:18.059
Or we struggle to fully grasp how it applies to us personally

00:36:18.059 --> 00:36:21.059
or in a given situation?

00:36:21.059 --> 00:36:23.059
What did Paul advise?

00:36:23.059 --> 00:36:27.059
He said keep perceiving what the will of Jehovah is.

00:36:27.059 --> 00:36:29.059
How can we do that?

00:36:29.059 --> 00:36:33.059
But just as a minor keeps digging deep below the surface of the ground

00:36:33.059 --> 00:36:35.059
to find precious gems,

00:36:35.059 --> 00:36:39.059
we must look beyond the surface of what we read in the Bible.

00:36:39.059 --> 00:36:43.059
This requires that we keep digging deep,

00:36:43.059 --> 00:36:48.059
carefully searching for gems in the form of Bible principles.

00:36:48.059 --> 00:36:52.059
Then, we must prayerfully meditate on what we find.

00:36:52.059 --> 00:36:58.059
Then, Jehovah's precious thoughts will become our thoughts.

00:36:58.059 --> 00:37:04.059
Perceiving Jehovah's thinking on matters will help us to avoid getting into a battle of wills,

00:37:04.059 --> 00:37:11.059
so we can follow His direction or whatever direction we receive from the governing body.

00:37:11.059 --> 00:37:13.059
Like the Ghibbi inites,

00:37:13.059 --> 00:37:19.059
may we be peacemakers by continuing to sow peace with Jehovah and His people.

00:37:19.059 --> 00:37:23.059
As we humbly make Jehovah's will our will,

00:37:23.059 --> 00:37:27.059
we will joyfully reap abundant peace forever.

00:37:27.059 --> 00:37:31.059
Brother Kenneth Flodin, a helper to the teaching committee,

00:37:31.059 --> 00:37:34.059
will now consider the next talk of the symposium.

00:37:34.059 --> 00:37:37.059
How they sowed and reap peace?

00:37:37.059 --> 00:37:38.059
Gideon.

00:37:38.059 --> 00:37:50.940
The man Gideon is the Bible example we will consider.

00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:55.940
But what is the challenge this talk intends to address?

00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:58.940
Are you ready for this?

00:37:58.940 --> 00:38:02.940
Difference is between fellow Christians.

00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:04.940
You might think, no, how can that be?

00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:10.940
Jesus said, the identify mark of His disciples will be the love among themselves, not the differences.

00:38:10.940 --> 00:38:12.940
And that is true.

00:38:12.940 --> 00:38:15.940
In our Christian Brotherhood, we feel the love.

00:38:15.940 --> 00:38:18.940
Love is prominent, it is dominant.

00:38:18.940 --> 00:38:23.940
But as individuals, we are drenched in imperfection.

00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:28.940
Differences will inevitably erupt.

00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:32.940
James 3-2 doesn't mention any words.

00:38:32.940 --> 00:38:35.940
It says, we all all stumble many times.

00:38:35.940 --> 00:38:37.940
Not constantly, not every day.

00:38:37.940 --> 00:38:41.940
But it acknowledges that we make mistakes many times.

00:38:41.940 --> 00:38:44.940
A brother or sister may say something to hurt us.

00:38:44.940 --> 00:38:49.940
Or maybe we push their emotional button with words, or they push ours.

00:38:49.940 --> 00:38:52.940
Usually it's not intentional.

00:38:52.940 --> 00:38:54.940
Often it's a misunderstanding.

00:38:55.940 --> 00:38:58.940
We or they say something in good faith.

00:38:58.940 --> 00:39:02.940
One thinks it's appropriate, the other does not.

00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:09.940
Or possibly what we said or did was perceived in a way that we could not even have imagined.

00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:11.940
But it happened.

00:39:11.940 --> 00:39:16.940
And now we must sow peace in order to reap peace.

00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:21.940
And when we plant seeds, some germinate much faster than others.

00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:27.940
In the opening talk of this symposium, it acknowledges that a farmer trusts

00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:30.940
he will see results in due time.

00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:36.440
If we find ourselves at odds with a fellow Christian,

00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:43.440
the Bible example of Gideon can help us to sow and reap peace.

00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:47.440
Now Gideon was at war with the Midianites.

00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:52.440
And he asked his fellow worshippers, the Ephraimites, to help chase them down.

00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:56.440
Judges chapter eight.

00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:58.440
They had tremendous success.

00:39:58.440 --> 00:40:00.440
We say great.

00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:03.440
But after the battle, the Ephraimites were offended.

00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:05.440
They tried to pick a fight with Gideon.

00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:10.440
They felt that Gideon did not call them into battles soon enough.

00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:12.440
Judges eight one.

00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:17.519
Then a minute of Ephraim said to him,

00:40:17.519 --> 00:40:19.519
what have you done to us?

00:40:19.519 --> 00:40:23.519
Why did you not call us when you went to fight against Midian?

00:40:23.519 --> 00:40:26.519
And they quarreled bitterly with him.

00:40:26.519 --> 00:40:30.519
Well, these are all armed fighting men.

00:40:30.519 --> 00:40:33.519
If this difference of opinion was allowed to escalate,

00:40:33.519 --> 00:40:35.519
it could go out of hand very quickly.

00:40:35.519 --> 00:40:41.519
In fact, in this case, hand-to-hand combat might have ensued.

00:40:41.519 --> 00:40:46.519
Instead, though, how did Gideon sow peace with words?

00:40:46.519 --> 00:40:49.519
Let's read verses two and three.

00:40:50.519 --> 00:40:52.519
Hey, Gideon said to them,

00:40:52.519 --> 00:40:55.519
what have I done compared with you?

00:40:55.519 --> 00:41:00.519
Are not the gleanings of Ephraim better than the great harvest of Abbeezer?

00:41:00.519 --> 00:41:05.519
It was into your hand that God gave Midian's princes Orab and Zeab.

00:41:05.519 --> 00:41:10.519
And what have I done compared with you?

00:41:10.519 --> 00:41:16.519
And notice, when he spoke this way, they calmed down.

00:41:17.519 --> 00:41:21.519
Now, in this case, the germination period was very short.

00:41:21.519 --> 00:41:26.519
Gideon sowed peace with well-choes and words,

00:41:26.519 --> 00:41:30.519
and he reaped peace in one conversation.

00:41:30.519 --> 00:41:33.519
Now, in the following dramatization,

00:41:33.519 --> 00:41:37.519
notice how a brother prevents a situation

00:41:37.519 --> 00:41:40.519
from escalating into a confrontation.

00:41:40.519 --> 00:41:52.860
And you know how jealous people are.

00:41:52.860 --> 00:41:57.860
When there's a need, our brother step up.

00:41:57.860 --> 00:42:01.860
So even though we had a lot of work to do back then,

00:42:01.860 --> 00:42:04.860
we always had willing workers.

00:42:04.860 --> 00:42:10.860
So many workers that some started to feel like they were being overlooked.

00:42:10.860 --> 00:42:17.059
Hey, Ray, what's up?

00:42:17.059 --> 00:42:21.059
Hey, Matt, I hear you're organizing the food distribution for our congregation.

00:42:21.059 --> 00:42:23.059
Yeah, try my best.

00:42:23.059 --> 00:42:25.059
Yeah, well, can I give you a hand?

00:42:25.059 --> 00:42:27.059
The truck's all ready to go.

00:42:27.059 --> 00:42:32.059
We actually finished just loading up for the day, so I think we're good.

00:42:32.059 --> 00:42:36.059
But wow, yeah, thank you very much for offering.

00:42:36.059 --> 00:42:39.059
Okay, when's the next run?

00:42:39.059 --> 00:42:42.059
You know what, Ray, we're about to pull out right now.

00:42:42.059 --> 00:42:44.059
Is it okay if I call you back?

00:42:44.059 --> 00:42:50.920
Yeah, sure.

00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:53.920
Ray was such a hard worker.

00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:56.920
More than most of us even realized.

00:42:56.920 --> 00:42:59.920
He put his heart into every assignment.

00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:05.489
But when I told him we already had all the help we needed,

00:43:05.489 --> 00:43:07.489
it didn't go the way I helped.

00:43:07.489 --> 00:43:09.489
Ray, I think you're muted.

00:43:09.489 --> 00:43:16.559
So what you're saying is you don't think I'm qualified to help out?

00:43:16.559 --> 00:43:18.559
No, no, we just...

00:43:18.559 --> 00:43:21.559
We know how hard you're working caring for your mom.

00:43:21.559 --> 00:43:24.559
Is Paul Thompson on your crew?

00:43:24.559 --> 00:43:26.559
Yeah, but...

00:43:26.559 --> 00:43:27.559
And Oliver Kagan.

00:43:27.559 --> 00:43:29.559
Oliver's my assistant, yes.

00:43:29.559 --> 00:43:31.559
You're just this work, man.

00:43:31.559 --> 00:43:35.559
I mean, you just use your friends and you shut the rest of us out.

00:43:35.559 --> 00:43:42.179
Don't you think I noticed how your brothers ignore me?

00:43:42.179 --> 00:43:49.090
Ray, why were you an apology?

00:43:49.090 --> 00:43:51.880
I'm so sorry.

00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:56.380
I should have spoke with you about this right from the start.

00:43:56.380 --> 00:43:59.380
You're working so hard taking care of your mom.

00:43:59.380 --> 00:44:03.380
The last thing we wanted to do was make things harder for you.

00:44:03.380 --> 00:44:05.380
But even more than that.

00:44:05.380 --> 00:44:08.380
We didn't want to have to ask you to do something.

00:44:08.380 --> 00:44:10.380
That would put you or your mother at higher risk.

00:44:10.380 --> 00:44:14.400
I know.

00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:18.349
I worry about that, too.

00:44:18.349 --> 00:44:20.349
Your mom?

00:44:20.349 --> 00:44:22.349
We wouldn't want anything to happen to her.

00:44:22.349 --> 00:44:25.349
She's one of our congregation treasures.

00:44:25.349 --> 00:44:27.349
I know.

00:44:27.349 --> 00:44:30.349
And you're not so bad, either.

00:44:30.349 --> 00:44:34.349
Seriously, you're such a good example.

00:44:34.349 --> 00:44:40.349
And think how Jehovah must feel when he sees all that you're doing.

00:44:40.349 --> 00:44:42.349
For us and for your mom.

00:44:42.349 --> 00:44:46.110
Thank you.

00:44:46.110 --> 00:44:48.110
That means a lot to me.

00:44:48.110 --> 00:44:51.110
If something comes up that I can help with then,

00:44:51.110 --> 00:44:54.110
even just a little, and I can do it from home.

00:44:54.110 --> 00:45:04.570
Two good brothers.

00:45:04.570 --> 00:45:06.570
But due to imperfection,

00:45:06.570 --> 00:45:11.570
they were both looking at the exact same situation from two different perspectives.

00:45:11.570 --> 00:45:16.570
Matt was well-intended in what he did for Ray.

00:45:17.570 --> 00:45:19.570
He realized he was caring for his early mother.

00:45:19.570 --> 00:45:21.570
He was trying to protect him.

00:45:21.570 --> 00:45:23.570
But Ray is offended.

00:45:23.570 --> 00:45:28.570
He even accused Matt of showing favoritism to his friends and ignoring others.

00:45:28.570 --> 00:45:31.570
Well, how did this calm down?

00:45:31.570 --> 00:45:34.570
Well, first of all, thankfully,

00:45:34.570 --> 00:45:40.570
Ray went directly to Matt and expressed his feelings between the two of them alone.

00:45:40.570 --> 00:45:43.570
Well, what did that allow for a follow?

00:45:43.570 --> 00:45:50.570
Well, Matt now had the opportunity to absorb and understand Ray's concerns.

00:45:50.570 --> 00:45:53.570
What a blessing that was.

00:45:53.570 --> 00:45:57.570
And so, what followed after that?

00:45:57.570 --> 00:46:00.570
Well, you remember when he grasped it,

00:46:00.570 --> 00:46:04.570
Matt paused and apologized.

00:46:04.570 --> 00:46:09.570
His words, like Gideon's, well-spoken, calmed Ray down.

00:46:09.570 --> 00:46:12.570
It was a short germination period.

00:46:12.570 --> 00:46:15.570
He sowed and reaped peace in one conversation.

00:46:15.570 --> 00:46:18.570
Well, how can we imitate Gideon

00:46:18.570 --> 00:46:22.570
when there's future differences with fellow worshippers?

00:46:22.570 --> 00:46:25.570
2 Timothy 224.

00:46:25.570 --> 00:46:30.570
And recall when the men of Ephraim confronted Gideon,

00:46:30.570 --> 00:46:32.570
they were confrontational.

00:46:32.570 --> 00:46:35.570
They were upset. They were rattling their sabers.

00:46:35.570 --> 00:46:38.570
But here, Paul,

00:46:38.570 --> 00:46:42.570
in effect summarizes for Christians, Gideon's demeanor.

00:46:42.570 --> 00:46:47.010
2 Timothy 224.

00:46:47.010 --> 00:46:50.010
For a slave of the Lord does not need to fight.

00:46:50.010 --> 00:46:52.010
You see, with words or swords.

00:46:52.010 --> 00:46:58.010
Instead, like Gideon, it says, but needs to be gentle toward all, qualified to teach.

00:46:58.010 --> 00:47:02.010
And notice this, showing restraint when wrong.

00:47:02.010 --> 00:47:05.010
That is not easy to do,

00:47:05.010 --> 00:47:11.010
but showing restraint when wrong is a means of sowing peace.

00:47:11.010 --> 00:47:15.010
Now, if it's just a minor offense, we might ask ourselves,

00:47:15.010 --> 00:47:20.010
can I put up with this slight to avoid a confrontation?

00:47:20.010 --> 00:47:24.010
But of course, in the case with Ray, he felt hurt deeply.

00:47:24.010 --> 00:47:27.010
Matt realized the perspective was different,

00:47:27.010 --> 00:47:31.010
but you remember in hindsight, Matt admitted,

00:47:31.010 --> 00:47:34.010
I should have talked to you first.

00:47:34.010 --> 00:47:38.010
With those words, he planted seeds of peace.

00:47:38.010 --> 00:47:44.010
Now, amazingly long before the first century, Gideon manifested

00:47:44.010 --> 00:47:49.010
later what became a Christian principle at Philippians 2.3.

00:47:49.010 --> 00:47:55.320
It says, with humility, consider others superior to you.

00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:58.320
Do you remember Gideon's exact expression?

00:47:58.320 --> 00:48:00.320
Twice, he said,

00:48:00.320 --> 00:48:04.320
what have I done compared to you?

00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:10.320
His humility calmed the Ephraimites down instantly.

00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:13.320
So what can we do?

00:48:13.320 --> 00:48:17.320
Well, we can apologize for our contribution to the difference,

00:48:17.320 --> 00:48:21.320
even if the apology is done on the other person's terms.

00:48:21.320 --> 00:48:23.320
We can pray for him.

00:48:23.320 --> 00:48:25.320
We can give a sincere compliment.

00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:27.320
Do something kind for the person.

00:48:27.320 --> 00:48:33.320
And if we have a discussion, may our words be gracious and toned kindly.

00:48:33.320 --> 00:48:36.320
Now, it would be nice if all the differences between Christians

00:48:36.320 --> 00:48:40.320
could have a short germination cycle.

00:48:40.320 --> 00:48:44.320
But due to circumstances, personalities,

00:48:44.320 --> 00:48:49.320
or the nature of the issue, that's not always possible.

00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:55.320
But may we each be determined to do our part to so peace,

00:48:55.320 --> 00:49:00.320
and like the farmer, expect peace in due time.

00:49:01.320 --> 00:49:09.699
And oh, how sweet restored peace truly is.

00:49:09.699 --> 00:49:11.699
And now, Brother Robert Lucioni,

00:49:11.699 --> 00:49:13.699
a helper for the Publishing Committee,

00:49:13.699 --> 00:49:16.699
will give the next talk of this symposium entitled,

00:49:16.699 --> 00:49:29.820
how they sowed and reap peace, Abigail.

00:49:29.820 --> 00:49:32.820
Pursuing peace can be a challenge.

00:49:32.820 --> 00:49:36.820
Because of our imperfections and the complexities of life,

00:49:36.820 --> 00:49:40.820
we have to work for peace, even under normal conditions.

00:49:40.820 --> 00:49:46.820
But pursuing peace becomes a greater challenge when it's one sided.

00:49:46.820 --> 00:49:50.820
At difficult, these arise in the family and in the congregation

00:49:50.820 --> 00:49:54.820
when one person pursues peace, but the other does not.

00:49:54.820 --> 00:49:57.820
For example, in the congregation, perhaps we have a friend

00:49:57.820 --> 00:50:01.820
who has a problem with another friend in the congregation,

00:50:01.820 --> 00:50:04.820
but does not do anything to reconcile the situation.

00:50:04.820 --> 00:50:09.820
Or in the family, a Christian mate may have difficulty pursuing peace

00:50:09.820 --> 00:50:13.820
if his or her spouse does not apply Bible principles.

00:50:13.820 --> 00:50:15.820
Well, what do we do then?

00:50:15.820 --> 00:50:21.820
Well, in those situations, the Bible account of Abigail may be helpful.

00:50:21.820 --> 00:50:25.820
And invite you to turn in your Bibles through 1 Samuel, chapter 25.

00:50:25.820 --> 00:50:29.820
And here we're introduced to Abigail and her husband, Nebel.

00:50:29.820 --> 00:50:31.820
And you notice here in verse 3,

00:50:31.820 --> 00:50:34.820
Nebel is described as harsh.

00:50:34.820 --> 00:50:39.820
In verse 25, Abigail describes him as senseless.

00:50:39.820 --> 00:50:44.820
In verse 17, his own worker describes him as worthless

00:50:44.820 --> 00:50:47.820
and says nobody can speak with him.

00:50:47.820 --> 00:50:50.820
Well, with a personality like that,

00:50:50.820 --> 00:50:54.820
it's not surprising that his name is streets, David's young man.

00:50:54.820 --> 00:50:57.820
And now David wants revenge.

00:50:57.820 --> 00:51:02.820
How do you pursue peace in a situation like that?

00:51:02.820 --> 00:51:04.820
What does Abigail do?

00:51:04.820 --> 00:51:06.820
Well, you think about it.

00:51:06.820 --> 00:51:08.820
What she could have done.

00:51:08.820 --> 00:51:11.820
See, Abigail could have done nothing.

00:51:11.820 --> 00:51:14.820
It's not hard to imagine that she had a difficult life as well,

00:51:14.820 --> 00:51:15.820
living with this man.

00:51:15.820 --> 00:51:18.820
She could have just stepped back, let David come through

00:51:18.820 --> 00:51:20.820
and do what he had in mind.

00:51:20.820 --> 00:51:24.820
Or she could have gone out to David and inflamed the situation,

00:51:25.820 --> 00:51:27.820
maybe describing what a terrible man he is

00:51:27.820 --> 00:51:30.820
and how he must treat her as well.

00:51:30.820 --> 00:51:34.820
See, either of these approaches could have made her life easier,

00:51:34.820 --> 00:51:36.820
but she didn't do that.

00:51:36.820 --> 00:51:40.820
Now, Abigail could not change her husband's ways,

00:51:40.820 --> 00:51:45.820
but she did what she could to diffuse an escalating conflict.

00:51:45.820 --> 00:51:48.820
In fact, notice her respectful, well chosen words.

00:51:48.820 --> 00:51:50.820
Let's go back to 1 Samuel 25.

00:51:50.820 --> 00:51:54.820
And let's read verses 27 through 31.

00:51:54.820 --> 00:52:00.300
Now, let this gift that your servant girl has brought to my Lord

00:52:00.300 --> 00:52:03.300
be given to the young man who are following my Lord.

00:52:03.300 --> 00:52:07.300
Pardon, please, the transgression of your servant girl.

00:52:07.300 --> 00:52:12.300
For Jehovah will without fail make for my Lord a lasting house.

00:52:12.300 --> 00:52:16.300
Because my Lord is fighting the wars of Jehovah.

00:52:16.300 --> 00:52:19.300
And no evil has been found in you all your days.

00:52:20.300 --> 00:52:25.300
When someone rises up to pursue you and seeks your life,

00:52:25.300 --> 00:52:28.300
the life of my Lord will be wrapped securely

00:52:28.300 --> 00:52:31.300
in the bag of life with Jehovah your God.

00:52:31.300 --> 00:52:33.300
But the lives of your enemies,

00:52:33.300 --> 00:52:36.300
he will hurl away like stones from a sling.

00:52:36.300 --> 00:52:40.300
And when Jehovah has done for my Lord all the good things he has promised,

00:52:40.300 --> 00:52:44.300
and he points you as leader over Israel,

00:52:44.300 --> 00:52:48.300
you will have no remorse or regret in your heart

00:52:48.300 --> 00:52:50.300
for shedding blood without cause.

00:52:50.300 --> 00:52:53.300
And for letting the hand of my Lord take revenge.

00:52:53.300 --> 00:52:57.300
When Jehovah confers good upon my Lord,

00:52:57.300 --> 00:53:00.300
remember your servant girl.

00:53:00.300 --> 00:53:02.300
And do you notice what Abigail does?

00:53:02.300 --> 00:53:04.300
She comes in with the gift.

00:53:04.300 --> 00:53:06.300
She bows down to David.

00:53:06.300 --> 00:53:09.300
She takes the blame for the situation herself.

00:53:09.300 --> 00:53:14.300
And she reasons with him using godly principles.

00:53:14.300 --> 00:53:19.300
Abigail's actions calm David and a verdict calamity.

00:53:19.300 --> 00:53:22.300
She pursued peace.

00:53:22.300 --> 00:53:26.300
But to do that, she had a look beyond her own feelings

00:53:26.300 --> 00:53:29.300
and consider what was best for Jehovah's name.

00:53:29.300 --> 00:53:32.300
And that is not always easy to do.

00:53:32.300 --> 00:53:34.300
But what was the result?

00:53:34.300 --> 00:53:39.300
Because she sowed peace, she pursued peace, she reaped peace.

00:53:39.300 --> 00:53:43.300
How can we benefit from Abigail's example?

00:53:43.300 --> 00:53:46.300
Why is it important to do so now?

00:53:46.300 --> 00:53:49.300
Let's look at the following dramatization.

00:53:49.300 --> 00:53:58.610
And later on, when things got even more intense,

00:53:58.610 --> 00:54:02.610
that's when our peace was really put to the test.

00:54:02.610 --> 00:54:08.610
Yeah, but Tim, you always found a way to keep us positive.

00:54:08.610 --> 00:54:13.610
Well, I learned a lot about that from my better half.

00:54:13.610 --> 00:54:16.610
Amy's always had a way of bringing people together.

00:54:16.610 --> 00:54:19.610
For example, just before the pandemic,

00:54:19.610 --> 00:54:22.610
there were these two pioneer sisters in our congregation.

00:54:22.610 --> 00:54:28.610
Becky was energetic, industrious, and fearless in her ministry.

00:54:28.610 --> 00:54:32.610
And Lena experienced self-sacrificing

00:54:32.610 --> 00:54:35.610
and such a good Bible teacher.

00:54:35.610 --> 00:54:43.829
But they didn't exactly get along.

00:54:43.829 --> 00:54:55.909
You ready to go?

00:54:55.909 --> 00:54:57.909
Are you okay?

00:54:57.909 --> 00:54:59.909
It's just it's Becky.

00:54:59.909 --> 00:55:02.909
She's just such a phantom pioneer.

00:55:02.909 --> 00:55:04.909
We never see her.

00:55:04.909 --> 00:55:08.909
I'm sorry, but she just needs to be serious about her ministry.

00:55:08.909 --> 00:55:10.909
She's been doing natural witnessing.

00:55:10.909 --> 00:55:12.909
I know, I know, an LDC, too, right?

00:55:12.909 --> 00:55:16.909
She does plumbing, concrete.

00:55:16.909 --> 00:55:20.909
She does have a lot of energy.

00:55:20.909 --> 00:55:22.909
Remember when we used to be like that?

00:55:22.909 --> 00:55:24.909
I don't know that I was ever like Becky.

00:55:24.909 --> 00:55:26.909
No, you weren't.

00:55:26.909 --> 00:55:28.909
You were Becky or the Becky.

00:55:28.909 --> 00:55:30.909
I couldn't keep up with you.

00:55:30.909 --> 00:55:32.909
Those long-service days in your little red car.

00:55:32.909 --> 00:55:40.579
That feels like a long time ago.

00:55:40.579 --> 00:55:44.579
You know, Becky reminds me a lot of you.

00:55:44.579 --> 00:55:48.579
I mean, both of us, 20 years ago.

00:55:48.579 --> 00:55:50.579
She's working so hard,

00:55:50.579 --> 00:55:54.579
and she's made so many sacrifices for the truth,

00:55:54.579 --> 00:55:57.579
just like you have.

00:55:57.579 --> 00:55:59.579
I think we should get together.

00:55:59.579 --> 00:56:01.579
The three of us.

00:56:01.579 --> 00:56:03.579
You should get to know her better.

00:56:03.579 --> 00:56:11.130
The next week, I had them both over to the house.

00:56:11.130 --> 00:56:15.409
And the more those two got to know each other,

00:56:15.409 --> 00:56:20.199
the closer they became.

00:56:20.199 --> 00:56:22.199
You know that proverb,

00:56:22.199 --> 00:56:25.199
the tongue of the wise is a healing?

00:56:25.199 --> 00:56:30.199
Amy taught me what that verse really means.

00:56:30.199 --> 00:56:33.199
Okay, everyone out.

00:56:33.199 --> 00:56:42.599
When everything changed,

00:56:42.599 --> 00:56:45.599
and we suddenly found ourselves locked up together,

00:56:45.599 --> 00:56:49.599
I tried to show that same spirit

00:56:49.599 --> 00:56:51.599
so that we could stay united.

00:56:51.599 --> 00:57:04.210
And with Jehovah's help, we did.

00:57:04.210 --> 00:57:13.420
Now, did you notice what our sister did and did not do?

00:57:13.420 --> 00:57:15.420
She could have done nothing.

00:57:15.420 --> 00:57:18.420
She could have let Lena, her service partner,

00:57:18.420 --> 00:57:20.420
cultivate those thoughts about Becky.

00:57:20.420 --> 00:57:24.420
Or, Amy could have poured fuel on the situation,

00:57:24.420 --> 00:57:26.420
maybe agreeing with Lena,

00:57:26.420 --> 00:57:30.420
or telling a few stories how Becky annoyed her as well.

00:57:30.420 --> 00:57:32.420
But she did not do that.

00:57:32.420 --> 00:57:36.420
See, Amy's desire to sow peace moved her to help Lena,

00:57:36.420 --> 00:57:39.420
see things from a different perspective.

00:57:39.420 --> 00:57:45.420
And as a result, the congregation benefited and reaped peace.

00:57:45.420 --> 00:57:50.420
Notice how the Apostle Paul explains this approach that we should take.

00:57:50.420 --> 00:57:55.420
Turning your Bibles to Romans, chapter 12 and verse 18.

00:57:55.420 --> 00:57:59.420
Romans, chapter 12 and verse 18.

00:57:59.420 --> 00:58:03.420
If possible, as far as it depends on you,

00:58:03.420 --> 00:58:06.420
be peaceable with all men.

00:58:06.420 --> 00:58:09.420
As far as it depends on you.

00:58:09.420 --> 00:58:12.420
See, our congregations, our families benefit

00:58:12.420 --> 00:58:17.420
when we sow seeds of peace before matters get out of hand.

00:58:17.420 --> 00:58:20.420
It's like seeing a small fire in our house.

00:58:20.420 --> 00:58:21.420
What do we do?

00:58:21.420 --> 00:58:23.420
Do we just ignore it?

00:58:23.420 --> 00:58:24.420
And hope it goes away?

00:58:24.420 --> 00:58:26.420
Do we fan the flames?

00:58:26.420 --> 00:58:28.420
Do we put fuel on it?

00:58:28.420 --> 00:58:29.420
No, we do something. Why?

00:58:29.420 --> 00:58:32.420
Because we know that if left unchecked,

00:58:32.420 --> 00:58:35.420
that fire could destroy our home.

00:58:35.420 --> 00:58:38.420
Well, as similar when we see problems

00:58:38.420 --> 00:58:40.420
that develop in peace being disrupted,

00:58:40.420 --> 00:58:42.420
we do the same. Why?

00:58:42.420 --> 00:58:45.420
Because we know that if we don't do something,

00:58:45.420 --> 00:58:47.420
and if it's left unchecked,

00:58:47.420 --> 00:58:53.420
that disturbance could destroy our family and the congregation.

00:58:53.420 --> 00:58:58.420
So the question is, how do we sow seeds of peace?

00:58:58.420 --> 00:59:01.420
Well, Abigail was a good example. Did you notice what she did?

00:59:01.420 --> 00:59:04.420
She considered how best to approach the situation.

00:59:04.420 --> 00:59:06.420
She was proactive.

00:59:06.420 --> 00:59:09.420
She didn't just hope it would go away on its own.

00:59:09.420 --> 00:59:13.420
She used respectful, soothing speech.

00:59:13.420 --> 00:59:17.420
She was careful not to fan the flames or add fuel to it.

00:59:17.420 --> 00:59:20.420
Oh, good steps we can take.

00:59:20.420 --> 00:59:23.420
And we have other resources to help us as well.

00:59:23.420 --> 00:59:26.420
We can do research in the Bible and in our publications

00:59:26.420 --> 00:59:30.420
to see how others have sowed peace in similar situations.

00:59:30.420 --> 00:59:34.420
And we can also consult with the elders.

00:59:34.420 --> 00:59:38.420
Now, we understand that this is especially a challenge

00:59:38.420 --> 00:59:41.420
if the situation isn't a family,

00:59:41.420 --> 00:59:43.420
as it was for Abigail.

00:59:43.420 --> 00:59:46.420
That is not easy at all.

00:59:46.420 --> 00:59:51.420
And in those situations, try to focus on your mate's good qualities,

00:59:51.420 --> 00:59:55.420
not on his or her irritating traits.

00:59:55.420 --> 00:59:58.420
But with all of this, we have to be realistic.

00:59:58.420 --> 01:00:02.420
Remember what the Apostle Paul said there is recorded in verse 18?

01:00:02.420 --> 01:00:08.420
He says, if possible, as far as it depends on you.

01:00:08.420 --> 01:00:11.420
So Paul was acknowledging that peace with others

01:00:11.420 --> 01:00:14.420
may not always be possible.

01:00:14.420 --> 01:00:15.420
So what do we do?

01:00:15.420 --> 01:00:17.420
We have to do the best that we can.

01:00:17.420 --> 01:00:21.420
And then we leave the rest in Jehovah's hands.

01:00:21.420 --> 01:00:28.420
So may we be determined to develop the practice of pursuing peace now.

01:00:28.420 --> 01:00:31.420
Whether we're in the congregation or in the family,

01:00:31.420 --> 01:00:36.420
we can be confident that if we sow peace, we will reap peace

01:00:36.420 --> 01:00:39.420
even if others don't respond.

01:00:39.420 --> 01:00:40.420
How?

01:00:40.420 --> 01:00:43.420
But we'll have peace with Jehovah, peace with ourselves,

01:00:43.420 --> 01:00:46.420
and the knowledge that we did the right thing.

01:00:46.420 --> 01:00:50.420
Additionally, when in the future,

01:00:50.420 --> 01:00:53.420
a force for peace is vitally needed,

01:00:53.420 --> 01:00:57.420
we will be prepared to provide it.

01:00:57.420 --> 01:01:01.420
For the William Mallenfond, a helper to the teaching committee,

01:01:01.420 --> 01:01:04.420
we'll now consider the next talk of this symposium,

01:01:04.420 --> 01:01:07.420
how they sowed and reap peace.

01:01:07.420 --> 01:01:08.420
Mephibashath.

01:01:08.420 --> 01:01:19.260
Inherited imperfection,

01:01:19.260 --> 01:01:24.260
we don't like it, but we all have it.

01:01:24.260 --> 01:01:30.260
And since imperfection means that everyone is less than perfect,

01:01:30.260 --> 01:01:34.260
we are bound to be treated unfairly at times,

01:01:34.260 --> 01:01:37.260
even by fellow Christians.

01:01:37.260 --> 01:01:41.260
In rare cases, one might become the victim of slander,

01:01:41.260 --> 01:01:44.260
or even fraud.

01:01:44.260 --> 01:01:47.260
Consider with me an account about slander

01:01:47.260 --> 01:01:52.260
that occurred in the nation of Israel in the days of King David.

01:01:52.260 --> 01:01:55.260
It's about a man named Mephibashath,

01:01:55.260 --> 01:02:00.260
who was slandered by a man named Zyba.

01:02:00.260 --> 01:02:05.260
Examining the way that Mephibashath handled this matter

01:02:05.260 --> 01:02:09.260
can be of real help to us to sow peace

01:02:10.260 --> 01:02:13.260
and to reap peace.

01:02:13.260 --> 01:02:17.260
Jonathan was Mephibashath's father,

01:02:17.260 --> 01:02:20.260
and King Saul was his grandfather.

01:02:20.260 --> 01:02:23.260
When Jonathan and Saul died,

01:02:23.260 --> 01:02:30.260
King David gave to Mephibashath all the land of his grandfather.

01:02:30.260 --> 01:02:33.260
David assigned Zyba as a servant

01:02:33.260 --> 01:02:38.260
to take care of the land that he had given to Mephibashath.

01:02:39.260 --> 01:02:43.260
Sometime later, a rebellion in David's household

01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:46.260
forced him to flee from Jerusalem,

01:02:46.260 --> 01:02:50.260
and Zyba went out to meet David.

01:02:50.260 --> 01:02:54.260
When David asked Zyba about Mephibashath

01:02:54.260 --> 01:02:59.260
and why he didn't come with Zyba to show his support for David,

01:02:59.260 --> 01:03:03.260
Zyba slandered Mephibashath,

01:03:03.260 --> 01:03:07.260
saying that he was seeking the kingship for himself.

01:03:08.260 --> 01:03:10.260
Sad to say,

01:03:10.260 --> 01:03:13.260
David believed the slander

01:03:13.260 --> 01:03:18.260
and gave Mephibashath's land to Zyba.

01:03:18.260 --> 01:03:23.260
Sometime later, Mephibashath met with King David

01:03:23.260 --> 01:03:28.260
and explained why he didn't show up to travel with him.

01:03:28.260 --> 01:03:32.260
He told David that Zyba had lied about him.

01:03:32.260 --> 01:03:36.260
Upon hearing Mephibashath's side of the story,

01:03:36.260 --> 01:03:43.260
David now decided that he and Zyba should share the land.

01:03:43.260 --> 01:03:47.260
Instead of complaining or seeking vengeance,

01:03:47.260 --> 01:03:54.260
Mephibashath displayed the spiritual qualities of a peacemaker

01:03:54.260 --> 01:03:57.260
and he was willing to be wronged.

01:03:57.260 --> 01:04:04.260
He said to David as recorded at 2 Samuel, chapter 19,

01:04:05.260 --> 01:04:07.260
and verse 30,

01:04:07.260 --> 01:04:10.260
these words,

01:04:10.260 --> 01:04:13.260
at this Mephibashath said to the king,

01:04:13.260 --> 01:04:16.260
let him take it all,

01:04:16.260 --> 01:04:22.260
now that my Lord the king has come to his house in peace.

01:04:22.260 --> 01:04:27.260
Yes, Mephibashath was more concerned about David's kingship

01:04:27.260 --> 01:04:31.260
than he was about himself.

01:04:31.260 --> 01:04:33.260
In the following dramatization,

01:04:33.260 --> 01:04:38.260
notice how a brother reacts to a perceived injustice

01:04:38.260 --> 01:04:44.260
and thereafter how he soes peace with his brothers.

01:04:44.260 --> 01:04:52.730
First time we met David,

01:04:52.730 --> 01:04:54.730
we were in chains.

01:04:54.730 --> 01:04:57.730
I'd seen a lot of things during my time as a guard,

01:04:57.730 --> 01:05:03.139
but nothing like the peace that you all had.

01:05:03.139 --> 01:05:05.139
Prison chains may be strong,

01:05:05.139 --> 01:05:09.139
but we all had something much stronger.

01:05:09.139 --> 01:05:12.139
But we had to work for that peace.

01:05:12.139 --> 01:05:14.139
Right, Phil?

01:05:14.139 --> 01:05:16.139
That's right.

01:05:16.139 --> 01:05:21.139
See, there was a misunderstanding,

01:05:21.139 --> 01:05:24.139
that God blown all out of proportion,

01:05:24.139 --> 01:05:28.769
and I didn't handle it the best.

01:05:28.769 --> 01:05:31.769
The more I tried to defend myself,

01:05:31.769 --> 01:05:34.769
the worse it became.

01:05:34.769 --> 01:05:38.769
Brothers, there must be some mistake.

01:05:39.769 --> 01:05:49.170
This isn't true, you know me.

01:05:49.170 --> 01:05:52.170
I wasn't prepared for how far I would go.

01:05:52.170 --> 01:05:54.170
There's one more announcement.

01:05:54.170 --> 01:06:00.170
Brother Philip Kim is no longer serving as an elder.

01:06:00.170 --> 01:06:08.840
The next few months were a real struggle.

01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:10.840
But by more details came to light,

01:06:10.840 --> 01:06:13.840
I thought I'd be reappointed,

01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:15.840
but I wasn't.

01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:26.010
I couldn't understand why.

01:06:26.010 --> 01:06:27.010
Phil, come on.

01:06:27.010 --> 01:06:41.820
I felt bitterness growing inside.

01:06:41.820 --> 01:06:44.820
Everything became about me,

01:06:44.820 --> 01:06:48.820
how I felt, what I deserved.

01:06:48.820 --> 01:06:51.820
It was like a fog that stopped me

01:06:51.820 --> 01:06:53.820
from seeing what Jehovah deserved,

01:06:53.820 --> 01:06:57.099
and I really needed his help.

01:06:57.099 --> 01:07:03.150
I found comfort in accounts of Jehovah's servants

01:07:03.150 --> 01:07:08.150
who were either misunderstood or misjudged,

01:07:08.150 --> 01:07:17.940
but maintained their loyalty to him.

01:07:17.940 --> 01:07:21.940
They helped me realize that it's a privilege

01:07:21.940 --> 01:07:24.940
just to be in Jehovah's organization.

01:07:24.940 --> 01:07:29.940
Being a peace with my brothers was more important

01:07:29.940 --> 01:07:32.940
than any appointed position.

01:07:32.940 --> 01:07:34.940
Without peace,

01:07:34.940 --> 01:07:37.940
I don't know how we could have managed what was to come.

01:07:37.940 --> 01:07:50.599
Our threat is fat today,

01:07:50.599 --> 01:07:52.599
and I'll be your secretary,

01:07:52.599 --> 01:07:57.070
just like Barrick was the Jeremiah.

01:07:57.070 --> 01:08:06.590
I don't know what I'd do without you.

01:08:06.590 --> 01:08:09.590
The question now for all of us is,

01:08:09.590 --> 01:08:14.590
how can we imitate the example of Mathibosheth?

01:08:14.590 --> 01:08:16.590
First of all,

01:08:16.590 --> 01:08:19.590
if you are the victim of minor gossip

01:08:19.590 --> 01:08:22.590
or rude treatment by someone,

01:08:22.590 --> 01:08:26.590
why not choose to let it pass

01:08:26.590 --> 01:08:29.590
and not make a big issue of it?

01:08:29.590 --> 01:08:33.590
Isn't that what first Peter 4.8 advises?

01:08:33.590 --> 01:08:36.590
First Peter 4.8 reads,

01:08:36.590 --> 01:08:43.590
above all things have intense love for one another,

01:08:43.590 --> 01:08:46.590
and then it tells us what our love can do.

01:08:46.590 --> 01:08:48.590
It says,

01:08:48.590 --> 01:08:53.590
because love covers a multitude of sins.

01:08:53.590 --> 01:08:57.590
Yes, love covers sins and imperfections,

01:08:57.590 --> 01:09:02.590
if we are willing to let love have its way.

01:09:02.590 --> 01:09:06.590
But what if you are the victim

01:09:06.590 --> 01:09:09.590
of a more serious injustice?

01:09:09.590 --> 01:09:11.590
For example, the brother in the video,

01:09:11.590 --> 01:09:14.590
he felt that he was a victim of injustice

01:09:14.590 --> 01:09:17.590
when he was deleted as an elder.

01:09:17.590 --> 01:09:20.590
He tried to clarify matters,

01:09:20.590 --> 01:09:24.590
but since he didn't get the response he was hoping for,

01:09:24.590 --> 01:09:27.590
he became very upset.

01:09:27.590 --> 01:09:29.590
He lost his peace,

01:09:29.590 --> 01:09:35.590
and he caused others to lose their peaceful relationship with him.

01:09:35.590 --> 01:09:38.590
To regain his peace,

01:09:38.590 --> 01:09:41.590
the brother dug into the scriptures,

01:09:41.590 --> 01:09:45.590
looking for examples he could benefit from,

01:09:45.590 --> 01:09:50.590
and he prayerfully looked to Jehovah to help him.

01:09:51.590 --> 01:09:55.590
He could see the importance of self-control

01:09:55.590 --> 01:09:58.590
and being guided by God's spirit.

01:09:58.590 --> 01:10:00.590
As a result,

01:10:00.590 --> 01:10:03.590
he was able to be at peace with himself,

01:10:03.590 --> 01:10:07.590
and so peace with his brothers.

01:10:07.590 --> 01:10:12.590
Now think for a moment about the unfair decision David made,

01:10:12.590 --> 01:10:18.590
when he told Mothibusheth that he and Zyba were to share the land.

01:10:19.590 --> 01:10:22.590
Zyba was the cause of the problem,

01:10:22.590 --> 01:10:24.590
not Mothibusheth,

01:10:24.590 --> 01:10:30.590
however, Mothibusheth displayed the qualities of a spiritual man

01:10:30.590 --> 01:10:34.590
by not looking out for his own interests,

01:10:34.590 --> 01:10:36.590
by being patient,

01:10:36.590 --> 01:10:40.590
and by not seeking vengeance.

01:10:40.590 --> 01:10:45.590
Read with me at 2 Samuel chapter 19,

01:10:45.590 --> 01:10:49.590
verse 25 through verse 28.

01:10:49.590 --> 01:10:52.590
2 Samuel 19, 25 through 28.

01:10:52.590 --> 01:10:54.590
It reads,

01:10:54.590 --> 01:10:56.590
When he came to Jerusalem,

01:10:56.590 --> 01:11:01.590
that is, Mothibusheth went to Jerusalem to meet the king.

01:11:01.590 --> 01:11:03.590
The king said to him,

01:11:03.590 --> 01:11:07.590
Why did you not go with me Mothibusheth?

01:11:07.590 --> 01:11:09.590
To this he said,

01:11:09.590 --> 01:11:11.590
My Lord, the king,

01:11:11.590 --> 01:11:13.590
my servant tricked me.

01:11:13.590 --> 01:11:15.590
For your servant had said,

01:11:15.590 --> 01:11:17.590
Let me get my donkey saddled,

01:11:17.590 --> 01:11:21.590
so that I may ride on it and go with the king.

01:11:21.590 --> 01:11:24.590
For your servant is crippled,

01:11:24.590 --> 01:11:28.590
but he slandered your servant to my Lord, the king.

01:11:28.590 --> 01:11:30.590
However, my Lord, the king,

01:11:30.590 --> 01:11:33.590
is like an angel of the true God.

01:11:33.590 --> 01:11:36.590
So do whatever seems good to you.

01:11:36.590 --> 01:11:42.590
All the household of my father could have been doomed to death by my Lord, the king,

01:11:42.590 --> 01:11:47.590
and yet you placed your servant among those eating at your table.

01:11:47.590 --> 01:11:53.590
So what right do I have to cry out further to the king?

01:11:53.590 --> 01:11:55.590
It's truly remarkable.

01:11:55.590 --> 01:11:59.590
Mothibusheth was grateful for what he had,

01:11:59.590 --> 01:12:01.590
and he was seeking nothing more.

01:12:01.590 --> 01:12:05.590
He enjoyed peace of mind and heart.

01:12:05.590 --> 01:12:11.590
If a matter involving slander or fraud arises today,

01:12:11.590 --> 01:12:18.590
a Christian may choose to follow Jesus' instructions at Matthew 18, 15, through 17.

01:12:18.590 --> 01:12:24.590
However, if for some reason following that procedure does not fully resolve the matter,

01:12:24.590 --> 01:12:28.590
he or she may choose to pursue it no further,

01:12:28.590 --> 01:12:35.590
and suffer loss rather than disturb the peace of the congregation.

01:12:35.590 --> 01:12:40.590
We can leave any unresolved issues with Jehovah,

01:12:40.590 --> 01:12:45.590
knowing that he sees what we do and what others do,

01:12:45.590 --> 01:12:50.590
and he will carry out justice at the right time.

01:12:50.590 --> 01:12:57.590
For our own benefit, we really must try to let go of resentment.

01:12:57.590 --> 01:13:01.590
When we do, we benefit ourselves.

01:13:01.590 --> 01:13:07.590
When we forgive, we forgive others, Jehovah forgives us.

01:13:07.590 --> 01:13:13.590
Now that doesn't mean that we minimize or excuse the wrong conduct of fellow believers, no.

01:13:13.590 --> 01:13:22.590
But it does mean that we imitate Mothibusheth by letting go of resentment and pursuing peace.

01:13:22.590 --> 01:13:29.590
We draw closer to Jehovah by following the advice at Psalm 55-22.

01:13:29.590 --> 01:13:35.590
Throw your burden on Jehovah, and he will sustain you.

01:13:35.590 --> 01:13:40.590
And never will he allow the righteous one to fall.

01:13:40.590 --> 01:13:43.590
And as Romans 15-13 assures us,

01:13:43.590 --> 01:13:52.970
Jehovah will fill you with all joy and peace by your trusting in Him.

01:13:52.970 --> 01:13:56.970
But the Joel Dalinger, a helper to the service committee,

01:13:56.970 --> 01:14:01.970
will now consider the next talk of this symposium.

01:14:01.970 --> 01:14:15.390
How they sowed and reaped peace, Paul and Barnabas.

01:14:15.390 --> 01:14:18.390
What's the next challenge we'll discuss?

01:14:18.390 --> 01:14:22.390
It's a disagreement between elders.

01:14:22.390 --> 01:14:25.390
If you're an elder, have you experienced that?

01:14:25.390 --> 01:14:29.390
Were voices raised? Did tempers flare?

01:14:29.390 --> 01:14:34.390
Has a friendship with a fellow elder cooled off?

01:14:34.390 --> 01:14:37.390
Though we rightly expect appointed brothers to be exemplary,

01:14:37.390 --> 01:14:43.390
the fact is, all of us, including elders, are still imperfect.

01:14:43.390 --> 01:14:47.390
Differences in backgrounds, personalities, experience, and opinions,

01:14:47.390 --> 01:14:49.390
can lead to disagreements.

01:14:49.390 --> 01:14:55.390
And a disagreement, if not resolved, can disrupt our peace and that of others.

01:14:55.390 --> 01:14:59.390
In this talk, we'll consider how two elders in the first century,

01:14:59.390 --> 01:15:03.390
Paul and Barnabas sowed and reaped peace.

01:15:03.390 --> 01:15:07.390
Let's see how their example can help appointed men today,

01:15:07.390 --> 01:15:12.390
including all of you dear elders, to resolve a disagreement.

01:15:12.390 --> 01:15:19.390
Please open your Bible with me to Acts 15 and read together verses 36 to 39.

01:15:19.390 --> 01:15:24.390
In the reading, please note the problem that arose between Paul and Barnabas.

01:15:24.390 --> 01:15:29.390
That's Acts 15 beginning at verse 36.

01:15:29.390 --> 01:15:33.390
After some days, Paul said to Barnabas,

01:15:33.390 --> 01:15:37.390
let us now return and visit the brothers in every one of the cities

01:15:37.390 --> 01:15:41.390
where we proclaim the word of Jehovah to see how they are.

01:15:41.390 --> 01:15:46.390
Barnabas was determined to take along John, who was called Mark.

01:15:46.390 --> 01:15:51.390
Paul, however, was not in favor of taking him along with them,

01:15:51.390 --> 01:15:54.390
seeing that he had departed from them in Pamphilia,

01:15:54.390 --> 01:15:57.390
and had not gone with them to the work.

01:15:57.390 --> 01:16:02.390
At this, there was a sharp burst of anger,

01:16:02.390 --> 01:16:05.390
so that they separated from each other,

01:16:05.390 --> 01:16:09.390
and Barnabas took Mark along and sailed away to Cyprus.

01:16:09.390 --> 01:16:11.390
What was the problem?

01:16:11.390 --> 01:16:16.390
These two elders strongly disagreed about whether to take Mark with them

01:16:16.390 --> 01:16:18.390
on their next missionary tour.

01:16:18.390 --> 01:16:23.390
Of course, expressing a difference of opinion is not always wrong,

01:16:23.390 --> 01:16:27.390
verse 7 of this same chapter reports that the apostles

01:16:27.390 --> 01:16:30.390
and older men in Jerusalem had an intense discussion

01:16:30.390 --> 01:16:33.390
that led to a good outcome.

01:16:33.390 --> 01:16:36.390
But in this case, what resulted?

01:16:36.390 --> 01:16:38.390
Please look again at verse 39.

01:16:38.390 --> 01:16:40.390
It would be nice to read,

01:16:40.390 --> 01:16:45.390
at this, Paul and Barnabas prayed to Jehovah and came to an agreement.

01:16:45.390 --> 01:16:49.390
Sadly, though, their discussion on this occasion

01:16:49.390 --> 01:16:55.390
led to a sharp burst of anger and they separated.

01:16:55.390 --> 01:17:01.390
As a result, their friendship was affected by a temporary strain.

01:17:01.390 --> 01:17:04.390
Why do we say temporary?

01:17:04.390 --> 01:17:10.390
Because in time, it appears that Paul and Barnabas put this matter behind them.

01:17:10.390 --> 01:17:13.390
A short time later, in Paul's letter to the Galatians,

01:17:13.390 --> 01:17:18.390
he wrote about Barnabas and the activity they had enjoyed together

01:17:18.390 --> 01:17:21.390
and Paul did not bring up their dispute.

01:17:21.390 --> 01:17:26.390
Also, when Paul later wrote to the Galatians and then to Timothy,

01:17:26.390 --> 01:17:29.390
Paul spoke well of Mark.

01:17:29.390 --> 01:17:32.390
In fact, in Paul's last inspired letter,

01:17:32.390 --> 01:17:34.390
the second to Timothy, he wrote this,

01:17:34.390 --> 01:17:39.390
bring Mark along with you, for he is helpful to me in the ministry.

01:17:39.390 --> 01:17:45.390
Yes, it seems that Paul and Barnabas resolved their disagreement.

01:17:45.390 --> 01:17:48.390
Now, let's think about that, brothers.

01:17:48.390 --> 01:17:50.390
What made that possible?

01:17:50.390 --> 01:17:52.390
It's this.

01:17:52.390 --> 01:17:55.390
Long before their disagreement,

01:17:55.390 --> 01:17:58.390
they had shared together in an exciting ministry.

01:17:58.390 --> 01:18:04.390
For years, they were united in what the Bible calls a bond of peace.

01:18:04.390 --> 01:18:08.390
So, even though their friendship experienced strain,

01:18:08.390 --> 01:18:14.390
the bond between them was strong, strong enough to withstand the stress.

01:18:14.390 --> 01:18:17.390
Well, let's bring this to our day.

01:18:17.390 --> 01:18:24.390
In the following dramatization, please notice how an elder shows peace.

01:18:24.390 --> 01:18:31.939
But you know there's more to the story?

01:18:31.939 --> 01:18:36.939
Phil didn't know just how tense things were between Tim and I.

01:18:36.939 --> 01:18:39.939
No idea.

01:18:39.939 --> 01:18:42.939
We never talked.

01:18:42.939 --> 01:18:46.939
I mean, really talked about it until it was too late.

01:19:00.319 --> 01:19:06.939
Look, we need to talk.

01:19:06.939 --> 01:19:09.939
I think we need to seriously reconsider Phil's qualifications.

01:19:09.939 --> 01:19:11.939
You know he's not the type of brother that...

01:19:11.939 --> 01:19:14.939
Enough. Enough about Phil.

01:19:14.939 --> 01:19:15.939
I know he's your friend.

01:19:15.939 --> 01:19:16.939
Friend.

01:19:16.939 --> 01:19:17.939
But the body agreed that...

01:19:17.939 --> 01:19:18.939
Friend?

01:19:18.939 --> 01:19:19.939
Friend?

01:19:19.939 --> 01:19:22.939
He's worked with us for years.

01:19:22.939 --> 01:19:26.939
The body decided unanimously that he should no longer serve.

01:19:26.939 --> 01:19:28.939
You pushed them.

01:19:31.500 --> 01:19:32.500
Excuse me?

01:19:32.500 --> 01:19:35.500
It's enough that we have those outside the congregation

01:19:35.500 --> 01:19:36.500
putting pressure on us.

01:19:36.500 --> 01:19:38.500
We do not need more in here.

01:19:38.500 --> 01:19:43.510
The conversation.

01:19:43.510 --> 01:19:44.510
The argument.

01:19:44.510 --> 01:19:46.510
It was terrible.

01:19:46.510 --> 01:19:50.789
We both said things we didn't mean.

01:19:50.789 --> 01:19:53.789
And after that, we both handled the situation poorly.

01:19:53.789 --> 01:20:33.300
We needed to make things right.

01:20:33.300 --> 01:20:34.300
It wasn't easy.

01:20:34.300 --> 01:20:39.920
But we talked it out.

01:20:39.920 --> 01:20:41.920
And we made peace.

01:20:41.920 --> 01:20:47.340
With Jehovah's help.

01:20:47.340 --> 01:20:49.340
Can you imagine what it would have been like in that cell block?

01:20:49.340 --> 01:20:51.340
If we hadn't.

01:20:51.340 --> 01:20:54.340
We finally told Phil the whole story.

01:20:54.340 --> 01:20:56.340
Once we were all roommates.

01:20:56.340 --> 01:20:57.340
Wow.

01:20:57.340 --> 01:21:03.409
Let's go sing.

01:21:03.409 --> 01:21:07.579
Our soul may cease.

01:21:07.579 --> 01:21:11.579
God's people are living in peace.

01:21:11.579 --> 01:21:17.090
With our eyes of faith.

01:21:17.090 --> 01:21:20.090
We see beyond the clouds.

01:21:20.090 --> 01:21:25.090
And know that the storm soon will see.

01:21:25.090 --> 01:21:46.819
Elders, here's the question before all of us now.

01:21:46.819 --> 01:21:50.819
How can we imitate Paul and Barnabas?

01:21:50.819 --> 01:21:51.819
First.

01:21:51.819 --> 01:21:54.819
As elders, we must apply scriptural counsel

01:21:54.819 --> 01:21:57.819
and our dealings with one another.

01:21:57.819 --> 01:22:00.819
In the video, we just saw how imperfection

01:22:00.819 --> 01:22:02.819
got the better of Tim and Carl.

01:22:02.819 --> 01:22:06.819
Their body language, choice of words, tone of voice.

01:22:06.819 --> 01:22:11.819
As Tim put it, the argument was terrible.

01:22:11.819 --> 01:22:13.819
But after the dispute.

01:22:13.819 --> 01:22:17.819
What did those two elders eventually do right?

01:22:17.819 --> 01:22:21.819
They applied scriptural counsel and made peace.

01:22:21.819 --> 01:22:25.819
For example, the divine counsel at James 3 and verse 17

01:22:25.819 --> 01:22:30.819
reminds all of us to be peaceable and reasonable.

01:22:30.819 --> 01:22:34.819
The watchtower once suggested how this could be applied to elders.

01:22:34.819 --> 01:22:35.819
I quote.

01:22:35.819 --> 01:22:39.819
Peace makers modestly express their thoughts.

01:22:39.819 --> 01:22:42.819
And then respectfully listen to those of others.

01:22:42.819 --> 01:22:44.819
Instead of insisting on his own way,

01:22:44.819 --> 01:22:49.819
a peacemaker will prayerfully consider his brother's viewpoint.

01:22:49.819 --> 01:22:51.819
If no Bible principle is violated,

01:22:51.819 --> 01:22:55.819
there is usually room for varied points of view.

01:22:55.819 --> 01:22:59.819
Experienced overseers know that preserving the peace

01:22:59.819 --> 01:23:04.819
is more important than getting one's own way.

01:23:04.819 --> 01:23:06.819
What a beautiful thought.

01:23:06.819 --> 01:23:08.819
So what's our first lesson?

01:23:08.819 --> 01:23:11.819
If we as elders apply scriptural counsel

01:23:11.819 --> 01:23:13.819
in our dealings with one another,

01:23:13.819 --> 01:23:16.819
we'll never allow a difference of opinion

01:23:16.819 --> 01:23:20.819
to become a cause for animosity.

01:23:20.819 --> 01:23:24.819
Romans 12 and verse 10 outlines a second lesson.

01:23:24.819 --> 01:23:27.819
Please open your Bible with me there.

01:23:27.819 --> 01:23:33.819
Under inspiration at Romans 12 and verse 10, Paul wrote this.

01:23:33.819 --> 01:23:39.819
In brotherly love, have tender affection for one another.

01:23:39.819 --> 01:23:44.819
In showing honor to one another, take the lead.

01:23:44.819 --> 01:23:49.819
Brothers, elders, now before life gets even more difficult,

01:23:49.819 --> 01:23:51.819
this is what we need to do.

01:23:51.819 --> 01:23:56.819
We need to strengthen love and affection for one another.

01:23:56.819 --> 01:24:01.819
We can do that by continuing to speak well of our fellow elders

01:24:01.819 --> 01:24:03.819
in public and in private,

01:24:03.819 --> 01:24:07.819
by resisting the urge to talk negatively to other elders

01:24:07.819 --> 01:24:09.819
about any disagreements that arise,

01:24:09.819 --> 01:24:14.819
and by regularly reflecting on our brothers good qualities

01:24:14.819 --> 01:24:17.819
and on our past service together.

01:24:17.819 --> 01:24:21.819
In the video, weren't we happy to see how Tim and Carl

01:24:21.819 --> 01:24:26.819
imitated Paul and Barnabas and eventually reaped peace?

01:24:26.819 --> 01:24:29.819
Though not easy, they applied scriptural counsel

01:24:29.819 --> 01:24:32.819
and resolved their problem.

01:24:32.819 --> 01:24:37.819
That warm smile on Carl's face, when he showed up at Tim's home,

01:24:37.819 --> 01:24:41.819
the dessert, perhaps Tim's favorite pie,

01:24:41.819 --> 01:24:46.819
the heart to heart talk, and their lasting friendship,

01:24:46.819 --> 01:24:48.819
even in prison,

01:24:48.819 --> 01:24:54.819
shows that they maintained their love and affection for each other.

01:24:54.819 --> 01:24:58.819
Dear brothers, elders, may we do likewise.

01:24:58.819 --> 01:25:02.819
Let's settle disagreements quickly and peacefully.

01:25:02.819 --> 01:25:06.819
When we do so, we'll reap not only peace,

01:25:06.819 --> 01:25:09.819
but we'll prove to be examples to the flock,

01:25:09.819 --> 01:25:13.819
just like Paul and Barnabas.

01:25:13.819 --> 01:25:15.819
Brother Stephen let a member of the governing body

01:25:15.819 --> 01:25:19.819
will now consider the final talk of this symposium

01:25:19.819 --> 01:25:22.819
how they sowed and reaped peace.

01:25:22.819 --> 01:25:33.270
Modern day examples.

01:25:33.270 --> 01:25:38.270
How do many people react when they see corruption and injustice?

01:25:38.270 --> 01:25:41.270
They become incensed, and they want to fix the problem.

01:25:41.270 --> 01:25:44.270
How do they try to fix the problem?

01:25:44.270 --> 01:25:48.270
By becoming involved in political efforts or social movements

01:25:48.270 --> 01:25:53.270
that claim to fight corruption and injustice?

01:25:53.270 --> 01:25:56.270
In contrast, why did Jehovah's Witnesses

01:25:56.270 --> 01:26:01.270
not get involved in political efforts or social movements?

01:26:01.270 --> 01:26:05.270
The simple answer, because they've learned from God's word

01:26:05.270 --> 01:26:10.270
that the problems of this world cannot be corrected.

01:26:10.270 --> 01:26:13.270
Ecclesiastes 115 says,

01:26:13.270 --> 01:26:17.270
what is crooked cannot be made straight.

01:26:17.270 --> 01:26:21.270
Sayings world around us is like the truck of a tree

01:26:21.270 --> 01:26:24.270
that has grown so crooked, twisted,

01:26:24.270 --> 01:26:28.270
nor old it cannot be made straight.

01:26:28.270 --> 01:26:31.270
Jehovah's Witnesses have learned it would be futile

01:26:31.270 --> 01:26:34.270
to spend our time in energy trying to correct

01:26:34.270 --> 01:26:38.270
what Jehovah tells us cannot be corrected.

01:26:38.270 --> 01:26:41.270
Additionally, Jehovah's Witnesses have learned

01:26:41.270 --> 01:26:47.270
how and where real peace can be found even now.

01:26:47.270 --> 01:26:51.270
In this regard, let's consider two modern day examples

01:26:51.270 --> 01:26:57.270
of ones who came to acquire Jehovah's thinking on this matter.

01:26:57.270 --> 01:27:03.270
Let's talk about as Hideo Nahokbria and Fratha Brun,

01:27:03.270 --> 01:27:05.270
now first as Hideo.

01:27:05.270 --> 01:27:08.270
Born in a remote part of East Timor,

01:27:08.270 --> 01:27:12.270
he experienced horrible guerrilla warfare during his childhood.

01:27:12.270 --> 01:27:15.270
Many of his neighbors disappeared or were killed,

01:27:15.270 --> 01:27:18.270
and he feared he would be next.

01:27:19.270 --> 01:27:22.270
But some years later he moved to the capital city

01:27:22.270 --> 01:27:27.270
and entered a university where he met many other use

01:27:27.270 --> 01:27:29.270
with background similar to his.

01:27:29.270 --> 01:27:32.270
He became part of a student group that was trying

01:27:32.270 --> 01:27:36.270
to achieve social change through political action.

01:27:36.270 --> 01:27:40.270
Many political demonstrations were organized,

01:27:40.270 --> 01:27:46.270
but most ended up in riots with many of his friends injured.

01:27:46.270 --> 01:27:48.270
Some were even killed.

01:27:48.270 --> 01:27:51.270
But then, through a relative who was studying

01:27:51.270 --> 01:27:54.270
with Jehovah's Witnesses, as Hideo started to study.

01:27:54.270 --> 01:27:58.270
Now here's what he said as he started this study.

01:27:58.270 --> 01:28:03.270
As I studied the Bible, I began to feel that I had never

01:28:03.270 --> 01:28:05.270
really known love.

01:28:05.270 --> 01:28:08.270
Despite my rough appearance and disposition,

01:28:08.270 --> 01:28:11.270
the Witnesses treated me with fellow feeling

01:28:11.270 --> 01:28:14.270
and brotherly affection.

01:28:14.270 --> 01:28:18.270
Well, soon he was baptized, became a regular pioneer,

01:28:18.270 --> 01:28:20.270
and he was so happy because now he knew

01:28:20.270 --> 01:28:23.270
he was truly helping people.

01:28:23.270 --> 01:28:27.270
He ended his life story with these words.

01:28:27.270 --> 01:28:32.270
In the past I felt angry, unloved, and unlovable.

01:28:32.270 --> 01:28:40.270
But thanks to Jehovah at last, I have found true love and peace.

01:28:40.270 --> 01:28:42.270
But now let's talk about Fratha.

01:28:43.270 --> 01:28:45.270
From an early age he was very upset

01:28:45.270 --> 01:28:49.270
by all the hatred, bloodshed, and war he saw around him.

01:28:49.270 --> 01:28:54.270
But especially he was disturbed by religion's role in all of this.

01:28:54.270 --> 01:28:57.270
He observed that much of this hatred, bloodshed, and war

01:28:57.270 --> 01:29:03.270
was encouraged, supported, or at least condoned by religion.

01:29:03.270 --> 01:29:08.270
But in 1955 he attended a Convention of Jehovah's Witnesses.

01:29:09.270 --> 01:29:13.270
And after the Convention he accepted a Bible study.

01:29:13.270 --> 01:29:16.270
Now during his studies he learned many wonderful things,

01:29:16.270 --> 01:29:18.270
but something he learned really motivated him.

01:29:18.270 --> 01:29:23.270
He learned the identity of the great prostitute,

01:29:23.270 --> 01:29:28.270
Bab and the Great, mentioned in Revelation 17 and 18.

01:29:28.270 --> 01:29:34.270
He learned that this prostitute is the world-empower-a-false religion.

01:29:34.270 --> 01:29:40.270
Then he was really amazed when he was shown Revelation 1824,

01:29:40.270 --> 01:29:44.270
which says in her the prostitute was found the blood

01:29:44.270 --> 01:29:48.270
of all those who have been slaughtered on the earth.

01:29:48.270 --> 01:29:53.270
So he learned that the world's religions could never be a force

01:29:53.270 --> 01:29:57.270
for international peace, because they take sides.

01:29:57.270 --> 01:30:01.270
They're divided, and they go to war.

01:30:02.270 --> 01:30:05.270
In contrast he saw that Jehovah's Witnesses

01:30:05.270 --> 01:30:11.270
are an international brotherhood that truly practices what Jesus taught.

01:30:11.270 --> 01:30:14.270
Freythe's progress was very fast.

01:30:14.270 --> 01:30:19.270
He got baptized, started pioneering, he attended the 50th class of Gilead.

01:30:19.270 --> 01:30:24.270
And as served many years in Guatemala helping people as he was helped

01:30:24.270 --> 01:30:29.270
to find the true source of peace.

01:30:29.270 --> 01:30:34.270
But now we ask, what are lessons we can learn from S. Hedio and Freythe,

01:30:34.270 --> 01:30:37.270
or many, but here are three big ones.

01:30:37.270 --> 01:30:44.270
Number one, we can never correct the corruption and injustice of this world

01:30:44.270 --> 01:30:49.270
by means of political efforts or social movements.

01:30:49.270 --> 01:30:52.270
That reminds me of the illustration of other years

01:30:52.270 --> 01:30:56.270
about trying to get rid of a problem with spider webs

01:30:56.270 --> 01:30:59.270
but being unable to get rid of the spider.

01:30:59.270 --> 01:31:01.270
You're not the webs down.

01:31:01.270 --> 01:31:04.270
Spider builds them right back, knock them down, builds them back.

01:31:04.270 --> 01:31:06.270
You never get rid of the problem.

01:31:06.270 --> 01:31:11.270
Well, in this illustration, Satan is the spider.

01:31:11.270 --> 01:31:15.270
And since he's the source of corruption and injustice,

01:31:15.270 --> 01:31:19.270
as long as he exists, the problem will exist.

01:31:19.270 --> 01:31:21.270
And little puny humans can't get rid of Satan.

01:31:21.270 --> 01:31:23.270
He's superhuman.

01:31:23.270 --> 01:31:27.270
So the solution must also be superhuman.

01:31:27.270 --> 01:31:30.270
And that's where God's kingdom comes in.

01:31:30.270 --> 01:31:34.270
God's kingdom can and will not only get rid of the webs,

01:31:34.270 --> 01:31:39.270
but the old spider Satan himself too.

01:31:39.270 --> 01:31:41.270
Now here's our second lesson.

01:31:41.270 --> 01:31:47.270
We must remember that political activism often leads to violence,

01:31:47.270 --> 01:31:50.270
which is the opposite of peace.

01:31:50.270 --> 01:31:52.270
We pursue peace, don't we?

01:31:52.270 --> 01:31:56.270
Not conduct that often leads to violence.

01:31:56.270 --> 01:32:01.270
Our third lesson, unlike the religions of this world,

01:32:01.270 --> 01:32:05.270
we must promote peace with all people,

01:32:05.270 --> 01:32:09.270
which definitely means we refuse to get involved in any way

01:32:09.270 --> 01:32:13.270
in the wars of Satan's world.

01:32:13.270 --> 01:32:17.270
That reminds me of an experience a young brother had in the ministry.

01:32:17.270 --> 01:32:20.270
A very emotional woman said to him,

01:32:20.270 --> 01:32:23.270
My son died.

01:32:23.270 --> 01:32:26.270
For you to have the freedom you have.

01:32:26.270 --> 01:32:30.270
Why won't you fight for your country?

01:32:30.270 --> 01:32:33.270
Well, very calmly, the young brother said,

01:32:33.270 --> 01:32:37.270
I'm very sorry about the loss of your dear son.

01:32:37.270 --> 01:32:43.270
But one thing I can guarantee you is that it was not one of Jehovah's Witnesses

01:32:43.270 --> 01:32:45.270
who killed your son.

01:32:45.270 --> 01:32:48.270
Now, I don't know if you can make that guarantee about your religion,

01:32:48.270 --> 01:32:51.270
but I can make that guarantee.

01:32:51.270 --> 01:32:53.270
Well, as it turned out, she was Catholic,

01:32:53.270 --> 01:32:57.270
so she definitely was unable to make that guarantee.

01:32:57.270 --> 01:33:03.270
So let's remember these three powerful lessons that we have discussed.

01:33:03.270 --> 01:33:07.270
But now we'd like to say to you dear interested ones in attendance,

01:33:07.270 --> 01:33:10.270
if you're not yet one of Jehovah's Witnesses,

01:33:10.270 --> 01:33:16.270
we warmly invite you to please study the Bible with us.

01:33:16.270 --> 01:33:21.270
See for yourself how genuine love is the best way of life

01:33:21.270 --> 01:33:27.270
and is the best way to deal with the problems that divide society today.

01:33:27.270 --> 01:33:34.270
Jesus made it crystal clear that the identified mark of true Christians is love.

01:33:34.270 --> 01:33:37.270
At John 1335, he said,

01:33:37.270 --> 01:33:46.270
by this all will know that you are my disciples if you have love among yourselves.

01:33:46.270 --> 01:33:48.270
So dear interested ones,

01:33:48.270 --> 01:33:55.270
say for yourself whether this genuine love exists among Jehovah's Witnesses.

01:33:55.270 --> 01:33:59.270
But now we say to those of you who are already Jehovah's Witnesses,

01:33:59.270 --> 01:34:06.270
please continue to cultivate and show love for the whole association of brothers.

01:34:06.270 --> 01:34:11.270
And doing so will require that you remain strictly neutral

01:34:11.270 --> 01:34:16.270
regarding the world's political affairs and other controversies.

01:34:16.270 --> 01:34:19.270
Just as our leader remained neutral.

01:34:19.270 --> 01:34:23.270
At John 1714, Jesus said of His disciples,

01:34:23.270 --> 01:34:26.270
they are no part of the world,

01:34:26.270 --> 01:34:30.270
just as I am no part of the world.

01:34:30.270 --> 01:34:34.270
So during discussions in the ministry or anywhere for that matter,

01:34:35.270 --> 01:34:41.270
remain strictly neutral on political topics.

01:34:41.270 --> 01:34:45.270
Take no position regarding what laws should be enacted,

01:34:45.270 --> 01:34:48.270
repealed, or changed,

01:34:48.270 --> 01:34:52.270
and don't pressure others to agree with your view.

01:34:52.270 --> 01:34:54.270
But to succeed in this,

01:34:54.270 --> 01:35:00.270
we must be careful not to allow the media of this world to manipulate our thinking.

01:35:00.270 --> 01:35:05.270
News broadcasts are often presented in a biased, opinionated way.

01:35:05.270 --> 01:35:09.270
So we've got to be careful not to adopt the bias of a commentator.

01:35:09.270 --> 01:35:12.270
Only if we keep our thinking neutral,

01:35:12.270 --> 01:35:17.270
will we be able to keep our speech and actions neutral also?

01:35:17.270 --> 01:35:18.270
And remember,

01:35:18.270 --> 01:35:22.270
your good example of showing love in Christian neutrality

01:35:22.270 --> 01:35:27.270
may attract honest hearted ones to the truth.

01:35:27.270 --> 01:35:29.270
But now we ask,

01:35:29.270 --> 01:35:33.270
what have we learned from this symposium?

01:35:33.270 --> 01:35:37.270
We'll let's highlight just one valuable takeaway lesson

01:35:37.270 --> 01:35:39.270
from each of our six parts.

01:35:39.270 --> 01:35:42.270
The first part, Joseph and his brothers,

01:35:42.270 --> 01:35:44.270
our lesson,

01:35:44.270 --> 01:35:49.270
so peace by letting go of resentment.

01:35:49.270 --> 01:35:52.270
The second part, the Gibbianites,

01:35:52.270 --> 01:35:55.270
humbly submit to Jehovah's will,

01:35:55.270 --> 01:36:00.270
even if it differs from what you prefer.

01:36:00.270 --> 01:36:02.270
The third part, Gideon.

01:36:02.270 --> 01:36:05.270
Prevent conflicts from escalating

01:36:05.270 --> 01:36:11.270
by choosing words that calm, reassure, and heal.

01:36:11.270 --> 01:36:13.270
The fourth part, Abigail.

01:36:13.270 --> 01:36:16.270
Do what you can to promote peace,

01:36:16.270 --> 01:36:20.270
and then leave matters with Jehovah.

01:36:20.270 --> 01:36:22.270
The fifth part, Muthibosheth,

01:36:22.270 --> 01:36:25.270
be willing to suffer loss

01:36:25.270 --> 01:36:28.270
rather than disturb the peace and the congregation.

01:36:28.270 --> 01:36:30.270
And just another thought in this,

01:36:30.270 --> 01:36:34.270
let's always remember that defending Jehovah's name and reputation

01:36:34.270 --> 01:36:40.270
is far more important than trying to defend her own name and reputation.

01:36:40.270 --> 01:36:42.270
Be willing to suffer loss

01:36:42.270 --> 01:36:46.270
rather than disturb the peace in the congregation.

01:36:46.270 --> 01:36:49.270
The sixth part, this part, modern day examples,

01:36:49.270 --> 01:36:53.270
serve the God of peace with His people,

01:36:53.270 --> 01:36:56.270
and you will have peace.

01:36:56.270 --> 01:36:58.270
Yes, during this symposium,

01:36:58.270 --> 01:37:00.270
we've learned many valuable lessons

01:37:00.270 --> 01:37:02.270
as to how we can sow peace.

01:37:02.270 --> 01:37:06.270
Let's all be determined to do so with all our heart.

01:37:06.270 --> 01:37:08.270
And what will be the final result?

01:37:08.270 --> 01:37:10.270
For the answer,

01:37:10.270 --> 01:37:13.270
let's watch the final dramatization

01:37:13.270 --> 01:37:15.270
of this symposium.

01:37:15.270 --> 01:37:22.229
There's one more story to tell.

01:37:24.579 --> 01:37:27.579
I didn't know it at the time,

01:37:27.579 --> 01:37:38.170
but seeds of truth were being planted in my heart.

01:37:38.170 --> 01:37:40.170
You were also different.

01:37:40.170 --> 01:37:44.479
I couldn't understand it.

01:37:44.479 --> 01:37:49.170
You were prisoners.

01:37:49.170 --> 01:37:50.170
Yes.

01:37:50.170 --> 01:37:56.869
But you felt free,

01:37:56.869 --> 01:38:02.840
truly free.

01:38:02.840 --> 01:38:05.840
After you were released,

01:38:05.840 --> 01:38:07.840
it became clear to me

01:38:07.840 --> 01:38:12.380
that you have God's blessing.

01:38:12.380 --> 01:38:17.220
And I wanted to know why.

01:38:17.220 --> 01:38:21.890
Phil, help me find the answer.

01:38:21.890 --> 01:38:24.890
And you will know the truth.

01:38:24.890 --> 01:38:30.029
And the truth will set you free.

01:38:30.029 --> 01:38:34.029
Phil encouraged me to make the truth my own.

01:38:34.029 --> 01:38:36.029
I had real trouble at first.

01:38:36.029 --> 01:38:40.310
With all the turmoil going on at the time,

01:38:40.310 --> 01:38:43.310
the idea of being peaceable

01:38:43.310 --> 01:38:48.619
and waiting on God's kingdom,

01:38:48.619 --> 01:38:50.619
it was hard to grasp.

01:38:50.619 --> 01:39:01.539
But with Jehovah's help,

01:39:01.539 --> 01:39:03.539
and the patience of these good people,

01:39:03.539 --> 01:39:09.300
I was baptized before the start of the Great Tribulation.

01:39:09.300 --> 01:39:21.649
Joseph, during our time in prison,

01:39:21.649 --> 01:39:23.649
the story of your life,

01:39:23.649 --> 01:39:25.649
your time in prison,

01:39:25.649 --> 01:39:27.649
and how Jehovah was always with you,

01:39:27.649 --> 01:39:31.649
became a real source of strength for us.

01:39:31.649 --> 01:39:33.649
I remember one day,

01:39:33.649 --> 01:39:36.649
Carl said,

01:39:36.649 --> 01:39:38.649
what did you say?

01:39:38.649 --> 01:39:40.649
I said, one day,

01:39:40.649 --> 01:39:42.649
we'll have a meal with Joseph.

01:39:42.649 --> 01:39:44.649
And we'll say,

01:39:44.649 --> 01:39:46.649
thank you.

01:39:46.649 --> 01:39:48.649
And here we are.

01:39:48.649 --> 01:39:51.649
Really, it's I who should thank you.

01:39:51.649 --> 01:39:54.649
Each and every one of your stories

01:39:54.649 --> 01:39:57.649
touches my heart.

01:39:57.649 --> 01:39:59.649
You know a lot about my life.

01:39:59.649 --> 01:40:01.649
But would it be alright

01:40:01.649 --> 01:40:03.649
if I shared a few more stories?

01:40:03.649 --> 01:40:05.649
Please, we have so many questions.

01:40:05.649 --> 01:40:07.649
Can you tell us about Egypt?

01:40:07.649 --> 01:40:09.649
We're all really like dreams.

01:40:09.649 --> 01:40:12.649
We got to talk about those dreams.

01:40:12.649 --> 01:40:16.649
You do have many questions.

01:40:16.649 --> 01:40:19.649
And I have many details to share.

01:40:19.649 --> 01:40:21.649
And thanks to our God, Jehovah,

01:40:21.649 --> 01:40:24.649
we have all the time we need.

01:40:47.770 --> 01:40:50.770
Have we discussed during this symposium?

01:40:50.770 --> 01:40:55.770
It's expressed at Galatians chapter 6, verse 7.

01:40:55.770 --> 01:40:58.770
For whatever a person is sewing,

01:40:58.770 --> 01:41:01.770
this he will also reap.

01:41:01.770 --> 01:41:04.770
If we sow tomato seed,

01:41:04.770 --> 01:41:07.770
we will always get tomato plants.

01:41:07.770 --> 01:41:10.770
Well, this unfailing fundamental truth applies to peace.

01:41:10.770 --> 01:41:12.770
If we sow peace,

01:41:12.770 --> 01:41:15.770
we will always reap peace.

01:41:15.770 --> 01:41:17.770
Although in some cases,

01:41:17.770 --> 01:41:20.770
it may take some time for the peace we sowed

01:41:20.770 --> 01:41:22.770
to bring good results.

01:41:22.770 --> 01:41:25.770
But if we persevere in sewing peace,

01:41:25.770 --> 01:41:28.770
we will reap peace of mind,

01:41:28.770 --> 01:41:30.770
peace with others,

01:41:30.770 --> 01:41:32.770
and most importantly peace with Jehovah,

01:41:32.770 --> 01:41:34.770
and we'll reap the reward

01:41:34.770 --> 01:41:36.770
of living forever in a world

01:41:36.770 --> 01:41:40.770
where there will be an abundance of peace.

01:41:40.770 --> 01:41:42.770
So let's be determined

01:41:42.770 --> 01:41:44.770
to sow peace now

01:41:44.770 --> 01:41:46.770
and we can reap peace forever.

01:41:46.770 --> 01:41:48.770
And if you think about it,

01:41:48.770 --> 01:41:50.770
that's a pretty good investment of our time

01:41:50.770 --> 01:41:52.770
and effort, isn't it?

01:41:52.770 --> 01:41:54.770
So peace now

01:41:54.770 --> 01:41:58.770
and reap peace forever.

01:41:58.770 --> 01:42:03.619
Thank you, brothers, for those practical talks.

01:42:03.619 --> 01:42:06.619
May we all remember these useful examples

01:42:06.619 --> 01:42:08.619
and sow peace now

01:42:08.619 --> 01:42:12.619
so that we can reap peace eternally.

01:42:12.619 --> 01:42:15.619
Let's sing together song number 28.

01:42:16.619 --> 01:42:18.619
Gaining Jehovah's Friendship.

01:42:18.619 --> 01:42:21.619
That's song number 28.
