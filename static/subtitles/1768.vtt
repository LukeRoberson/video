00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:12.060
I was born in 1943 as the eldest son of six siblings.

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:18.839
My father expected me to become a judge or a prosecutor.

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:26.359
I was baptized on October 24, 1959, during my first year of high school.

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:31.640
The more I did personal study, I came to the conclusion that rather than spending four

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:37.200
years in higher education, it would be more beneficial for me to pioneer while delving

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.840
deeper into the Bible through personal study.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:46.799
So instead of going to college, I began regular pioneering in February 1962 and 11 months

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:52.079
later in January 1963, I was assigned to serve as a special pioneer.

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.479
I was convinced that I had chosen the best path.

00:00:55.479 --> 00:01:00.640
That's why when I hear the successful careers my old classmates have had, I don't feel

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.119
jealous at all.

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:07.519
Instead, I think of how nice it would be if they too learned the Bible truths like I did.

00:01:07.519 --> 00:01:15.640
I was assigned to the traveling work in 1971, but due to adjustments in our organisation

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:21.200
and because of my conscientious objection to military service, I had to stop serving as

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:28.370
a travelling overseer on two separatications.

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:33.689
When I received a new assignment as a field instructor, I'd really enjoyed that work.

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:39.849
Before we were reassigned once again a special pioneer in September 2014, I was a bit disappointed

00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:45.329
at first since I really enjoyed teaching and I felt I could have continued as a field instructor

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.370
for another ten years.

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:52.849
Hoping to bring glory to Jehovah, I prayed earnestly to be able to use the experience I had gained

00:01:52.849 --> 00:01:57.890
over the years to bring glory to God and find interested ones.

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:03.090
Unexpectedly, I was blessed with ten great Bible studies and that renewed my love of

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.409
teaching.

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:10.449
We know that Jehovah gives each individual work that is perfectly suited to them.

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:16.169
We feel that serving a special pioneers, as we currently do, is a rewarding assignment

00:02:16.169 --> 00:02:23.210
that brings us happiness.

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:26.889
Looking back at all that has happened and counting all the years we've been in a special

00:02:26.889 --> 00:02:31.610
full-time service, we realise that together we have been serving for more than a hundred

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.490
years.

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:39.129
One thing I learned from this was that if you adhere to theocratic direction, many blessings

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:42.490
are sure to follow.

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:48.370
Just as he promised, Jehovah is given us everything we ever needed and more.

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.810
He gave us not just a hundredfold but a hundred times a hundredfold, brothers and sisters

00:02:53.810 --> 00:03:01.139
who were like family to us.

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:06.659
We got married on April 1st, 1968, so as of this year we have been married exactly

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:08.780
fifty years.

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:14.819
In June 2017, my wife was not feeling well and we went for a health check-up.

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:21.020
She was diagnosed with stage 4 bone cancer and it had spread all through her back.

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:26.099
She felt very weak and we had a very difficult time, but Jehovah gave us strength and wisdom

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:31.060
to endure and now her condition is more stable.

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.340
Now our health is not as good as it used to be, but thanks to the loving and firm special

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:41.180
pioneer arrangement, we were able to keep serving Jehovah faithfully without it being a burden.

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:46.259
Through economic troubles, health problems and all of the difficulties that we encountered,

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:49.539
we always felt that Jehovah was with us.

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:54.460
So we really feel that Jehovah has securely wrapped us in the bag of life and has watched

00:03:54.460 --> 00:04:03.340
over us throughout our lives, just as he had promised in 1 Samuel 2529.

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:08.099
These days we pray to Jehovah that we can serve him faithfully, survive Armageddon

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:13.620
together and enjoy everlasting life in the new system as an eternally married couple.
