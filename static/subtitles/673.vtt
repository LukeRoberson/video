WEBVTT

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:05.549
We departed JFK Airport on the evening of April 22

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.550
and arrived in Warsaw, Poland the next day.

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.550
Though parts of Warsaw date back to the medieval period

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:17.550
in the 13th and 14th centuries, it is very much a modern city.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.550
Shining new skyscrapers have mushroomed.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.550
As in every large city, Warsaw's inhabitants have to deal

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.550
with heavy traffic and noise.

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.550
So how refreshing it was to arrive at the branch office,

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.549
located in a small village, a few miles southwest of Warsaw.

00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:41.549
It is an attractive complex of buildings with a beautifully designed courtyard.

00:00:41.549 --> 00:00:48.549
It was a pleasure to meet the 148 members of the Bethel family in their department,

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:53.549
such as the laundry, the sign language department,

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:56.549
and the broadcasting department.

00:00:56.549 --> 00:01:02.549
The translation department has been very busy translating in three new languages,

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:06.549
Kazubian, Celesian, and Romani.

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:11.549
They produce the video, why study the Bible in these local languages.

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.549
It was thrilling to see people watching the video

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.549
in their mother tongues with tears in their eyes.

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:23.549
In March 2016, publishers in a small town preached

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.549
among the community of Roma people, inviting them to the memorial.

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:32.549
Twenty-four of them came or every fourth person in the town.

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.549
The talk given in Romani was transmitted from a congregation in London.

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:39.549
They were touched.

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:41.549
One young Roma man told the brothers,

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.549
this has reached my heart.

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:49.549
I would like to become God's servant to be God's child.

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:53.549
Though a large percentage of the Bethel family is young in years,

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.549
the old timers are treasured for their very rich history of faithfulness under trial.

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:06.060
Here are two widows, from left to right, Zovia Shider, and Anela Adak.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.060
They were able to assist Alice to identify brothers and sisters

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.060
in a photo of the Bethel family taken in 1992.

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.060
Both sisters' husbands had taken the lead in the Polish field

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.060
for many decades while under ban.

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.060
Sister Adak herself was in prison three times.

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:30.060
How did she keep herself strong during those difficult times?

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.060
She persistently prayed, and when she was permitted to go to the library,

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.060
she eagerly read the Bible there,

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.060
and would even memorize whole chapters.

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.060
You could not help but be inspired by these loyal humble sisters

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.060
whose faith conquered the world.

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:54.060
On Saturday, April 30, we traveled to the Warsaw Assembly Hall for the special meeting.

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.060
Practically the whole country was tied in by streaming via the Internet.

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:06.060
The total attendance was 118,725.

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:12.060
Has the newer generation of witnesses in Poland fully entered the door of activity

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:18.060
open to them in May 1989 when witnesses were legally recognized?

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.060
The Branch Committee confirmed that in 1989,

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.060
there were 91,000 kingdom publishers.

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.060
Today, there are over 122,000.

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:38.060
There is good potential for further growth since 191,524 attended the last memorial.

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:44.060
Also, many young ones are being taught to love Jehovah by their God-fearing parents.

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:49.060
Young ones are mastering up boldness to witness as this experience illustrates.

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:57.060
Natalie, a regular pioneer, studies the Bible with a woman who has an 11-year-old daughter, Michelle.

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:03.060
As school, Michelle was assigned to prepare a presentation on a religion of her choice.

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:09.060
Well, her mother and father grew up in families of witnesses, but never progressed to baptism.

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.060
Still, Michelle felt this was her religion.

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.060
She prepared slides and videos from our website.

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:23.060
Michelle's teacher was so impressed, she arranged for Natalie to come to further explain things.

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:28.060
Natalie conducted a question and answer session based on the Awake article

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:35.060
in the first issue of 2016 entitled, What Do You Know About Jehovah's Witnesses?

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:41.060
After the presentation, all were invited to come to the Kingdom Hall for a guided tour.

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:45.060
Twenty children and two teachers came to the Kingdom Hall.

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.060
They were shown all its features.

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:51.060
They saw the video, what happens at the Kingdom Hall.

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:56.060
The children were allowed to use the microphones to see what it's like to give a comment.

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:03.060
Since they had also visited a mosque and a church, they were asked what differences they noticed

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:06.060
between those places and the Kingdom Hall.

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:13.060
Their personal comments were very touching, including one boy who stated, You are so open to others.

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:17.060
At the end, much literature was placed.

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:20.060
11-year-old Michelle was very proud and happy.

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:25.060
Some students told her that her religion is really cool.

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:29.060
It was time to say goodbye to the Poland Bethel family.

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:33.060
Our next stop was Levive Ukraine.

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:38.060
Levive is considered Ukraine's most cultural and elegant city.

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:43.060
Being more than 750 years old, it has a lot of history behind it.

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:48.060
Just three miles north of Levive in the midst of a picturesque pine forest

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:52.060
is a lovely Ukraine branch office.

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:56.060
The beautiful grounds are well maintained by commuters and Bethelites.

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:59.060
We knew we were in for a wonderful visit

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:03.060
by the warm welcome we received on our arrival.

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:08.060
The branch committee is thrilled to see how Jehovah has blessed the work in this country.

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:12.060
In 1991, we were officially registered in Ukraine.

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:16.060
The door had swung wide open for the preaching work.

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:20.060
At that time, there were about 25,000 publishers.

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:25.060
Have the brothers vigorously entered that door of activity since that year?

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:27.060
They surely have.

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:31.060
Today, there are 141,000 publishers.

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:37.060
The 2016 memorial attendance was over 242,000.

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:39.060
Here you see the happy missionaries.

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:44.060
They have reason to be joyful considering the fertile territory in which they were.

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:48.060
At the special meeting, that originated at the Bethel Auditorium.

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:53.060
Brother Callisto gave a report on the activity of the branch.

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:57.060
Especially noteworthy were his comments about eastern Ukraine.

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:00.060
You likely remember that in 2014,

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:03.060
a conflict broke out in this region.

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:07.060
A ceasefire was declared in 2015,

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:11.060
but there still is much civil unrest in tension.

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:15.060
How have the almost 10,000 publishers in this region fared?

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:20.060
Brother Callisto interviewed one of the six courageous circuit overseers

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:22.060
who served in eastern Ukraine,

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:24.060
brother Ivan Nebara,

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:27.060
and his equally courageous wife Anna.

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:31.060
Brother Nebara informed us that for the first time in two and a half years,

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:34.060
they were able to hold a meeting with the pioneers.

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:37.060
Look at those happy faces.

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:43.060
Even though some of our dear brothers must travel long distances to meet at their kingdom hall,

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:46.060
they do so to keep themselves built up.

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:50.060
For example, during brother Nebara's visit,

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:52.060
this 91-year-old sister,

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:55.060
though living far from the kingdom hall,

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:58.060
was present at all the morning groups for service,

00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:01.060
and then would go out again in the afternoons.

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:04.060
Her faithfulness is a blessing to the brothers.

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:09.060
Many brothers live in areas where there is much devastation.

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:14.060
Roon buildings and fences riddled with bullet holes

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:18.060
remind them of the presence of the military.

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:21.060
Preaching from house to house has resumed,

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:25.060
and in some areas, public witnessing is possible.

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:29.060
Well, we were all encouraged by this report.

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:35.059
These special meeting talks were translated simultaneously into five languages,

00:08:35.059 --> 00:08:38.059
and were transmitted to all the congregations,

00:08:38.059 --> 00:08:41.059
including those in eastern Ukraine.

00:08:41.059 --> 00:08:45.059
We were pleased to hear the final attendance figure for the special meeting,

00:08:45.059 --> 00:08:50.059
a 144,944.

00:08:50.059 --> 00:08:55.059
The spirit of the Ukraine Bethel family is outstanding.

00:08:55.059 --> 00:08:59.059
There are many young ones, some relatively new in the truth,

00:08:59.059 --> 00:09:04.059
and others whose family members were exiled to Siberia during Stalin's time.

00:09:05.059 --> 00:09:09.059
The special meal with the family included a chorus

00:09:09.059 --> 00:09:17.980
and traditional Ukrainian folk dancing.

00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:20.980
It was a happy time for all.

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:24.980
So the day arrives for us to leave.

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:27.980
It was hard to leave these dear friends.
