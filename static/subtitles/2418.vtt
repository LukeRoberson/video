00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:13.750
I woke up this morning and dressed for the day

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:20.640
I prayed to Jehovah and went on my way

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:27.460
I was told not to preach but I cannot bear

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:35.350
God is my ruler rather than man

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.350
I like the breeze blowing out in the field

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.350
I feel peace riding

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.350
I know Jehovah's with me so why should I feel?

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:58.140
I know Jehovah's with me so why should I feel?

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:05.409
As I get back home and think about this day

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:12.420
I've been on the bench at so much to say

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:19.409
So I pray that I'll see him again this soon

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:25.680
I know it feels better if he had the truth

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:32.629
I like the breeze blowing out in the field

00:01:32.629 --> 00:01:36.629
I feel peace riding

00:01:36.629 --> 00:01:42.629
I know Jehovah's with me so why should I feel?

00:01:42.629 --> 00:01:50.060
I know Jehovah's with me so why should I feel?

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:59.540
Let's burn these words I will speak

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.540
I'll do my part

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.540
I'll spread his name the best that I can

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.539
And I will keep going right down to the end

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.539
Knowing my brothers are fighting this fight

00:02:12.539 --> 00:02:14.539
I'll strengthen my faith

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:16.539
Keep it alive

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:20.539
Trust in Jehovah as praise as I sing

00:02:20.539 --> 00:03:23.500
Knowing the new world he soon will get down to sleep tonight

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:29.550
I think Jehovah in turn out like

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:39.699
What tomorrow may bring I do not know

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:43.699
But I know that I won't face it alone

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:50.509
I like the breeze blowing out in the field

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:52.509
I feel peace

00:03:52.509 --> 00:04:06.770
I know Jehovah's with me so why should I feel?
