00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:08.070
put away from yourselves every kind of malicious bitterness, anger,

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:15.109
wrath, screaming, and abuse of speech, as well as everything injurious.

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:17.870
Did anyone start the day thinking,

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:22.269
I believe I'll show malicious bitterness to my brother today?

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:27.269
Of course not, and yet the potential is there, isn't it?

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.070
But genuine affection, fight, peace records.

00:00:32.869 --> 00:00:38.670
And affection grows when we really know our brothers and sisters well.

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:48.670
We remember their joys and pain, their selfless zeal,

00:00:48.670 --> 00:01:00.380
how they came to love Jehovah and what they endure.

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.179
I'll get back soon so I can.

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:03.179
I love you. Bye.

00:01:03.179 --> 00:01:05.180
Oh no.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:06.180
Oh my God.

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.180
I'm not taking good care of you.

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:09.180
Hey, you love?

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.180
Too sorry, got a run.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:12.180
Okay, I'll ring you about this week.

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.180
Thanks, love you both.

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:14.180
See you.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.180
Yeah, too.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.180
Better.

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.620
No, no.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.620
Hello, hey, you darling.

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.620
I'm so, so sorry.

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:24.620
Oh yeah.

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.620
It's not too bad.

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.620
I got this.

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.620
Oh, how are you, though?

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:32.620
Thank you.

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:33.620
I'm so, so sorry.

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:34.620
Poor thing.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:02:41.939
Let me clear this up.

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:42.939
Hello, everyone.

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:44.939
Haley from Genoa Design here.

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:47.939
Helping you to be effortlessly elegant.

00:02:47.939 --> 00:03:07.020
Can you believe how?

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.020
Haley's business feed.

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:22.090
When you look this good.

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:51.310
Bad news.

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:56.830
She's a sweetie.

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:59.830
Reminds me, I want to speak to her about a necklace.

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:00.830
You too.

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:02.830
You don't think she's showing off?

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:03.830
No.

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:06.830
Everyone thinks she's miswonderful.

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:08.830
She's starting to agree.

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:13.550
Is this just about Haley?

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:17.439
Seems it's all about Haley.

00:04:17.439 --> 00:04:21.649
Your tea's getting cold.

00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:27.430
And you're changing the subject.

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:32.430
No, but you've brought this up before.

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.430
What is it?

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:37.430
Your friends.

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.430
You pioneer together.

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:43.430
Yeah, and that's why I'm concerned.

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.430
Concern is good.

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.430
But...

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:52.430
Is there just a little bit of envy in there?

00:04:52.430 --> 00:05:07.009
Concerned.

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:09.009
Concern is good.

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:10.009
But...

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:14.009
Is there just a little bit of envy in there?

00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:18.279
I thought you would understand.

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:22.879
I think I understand your feelings.

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:24.879
Not about Haley.

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:27.879
I haven't seen all her posts.

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:29.879
There's nothing immoral is there.

00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:33.160
No.

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:34.160
Good.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.160
That's not like her.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:41.160
Now, if it's the case of her being more careful,

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:44.160
how she comes across, that's another matter.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.160
Why didn't you talk to her?

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:58.230
Emily, you are a beautiful, spiritual sister.

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:05.490
You know, for years,

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:11.629
I had a bad habit comparing myself to others.

00:06:11.629 --> 00:06:19.629
My own insecurity hurt me and my closest friends.

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:34.959
So, you don't think I should have spoken to Celia?

00:06:34.959 --> 00:06:37.959
I'm glad you've asked Celia about it.

00:06:37.959 --> 00:06:41.459
Tell me when you trust.

00:06:41.459 --> 00:06:43.459
What did she say?

00:06:43.459 --> 00:06:46.459
She definitely understands how I feel.

00:06:46.459 --> 00:06:49.350
Good.

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:52.350
How about Haley's posts?

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:57.350
She hasn't seen everything she has out there.

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:03.949
She did say that Haley needs to be more careful

00:07:03.949 --> 00:07:06.949
how she comes across.

00:07:06.949 --> 00:07:12.800
What did she suggest?

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:16.800
I should tell her that she needs to stop,

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:23.189
but I'm too worked up.

00:07:23.189 --> 00:07:31.339
Look, if Celia agrees that Haley's doing something she shouldn't,

00:07:32.339 --> 00:07:38.529
you should talk to her.

00:07:38.529 --> 00:07:49.170
You'll find the right time.

00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:51.170
Thanks for understanding.

00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:54.540
Can you say the prayer?

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:55.540
Sure.

00:07:55.540 --> 00:08:11.490
Jehovah, we would like to praise you for your generosity and kindness.

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:13.490
Especially as a pioneer.

00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:15.490
What kind of example is she setting?

00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:17.490
Has Emily stopped following her?

00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:20.490
No, not yet, but she probably will.

00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:22.490
Alistair, what do you think?

00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:24.490
About what?

00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:27.490
Haley's posts on a quick post.

00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:29.490
Is there a problem?

00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:31.490
Emily's told me.

00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:33.490
They're all just look at me.

00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:37.490
My clothes, my hair, my makeup,

00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:40.490
and even Celia agrees with her.

00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:47.490
Well, it's very easy to take things out of context on social media.

00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:50.490
I know that I've done that

00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:54.490
and realized later that I was wrong.

00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:57.490
Yeah, that's a good point.

00:08:57.490 --> 00:09:00.490
Listen, I don't want to pull you away,

00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:02.490
but if you have a minute,

00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:04.490
would you mind giving me a hand with these boxes?

00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:05.490
Sure.

00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:16.440
Thanks for your help.

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:18.440
No problem.

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:20.440
Jake, back in the hall,

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:23.440
I know you were just expressing concern,

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:25.440
but here's something to consider.

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:29.440
This principle is one of my favourites.

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:35.440
It's found in Proverbs chapter 18 and verse 17.

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:41.009
The first to state his case seems right

00:09:41.009 --> 00:09:44.009
until the other party comes and cross-examines it,

00:09:44.009 --> 00:09:51.679
and try to understand.

00:09:51.679 --> 00:09:57.679
It just means that sometimes we only hear one side of a story.

00:09:57.679 --> 00:10:00.679
And until we personally hear both,

00:10:00.679 --> 00:10:04.679
it's best not to draw any conclusions.

00:10:04.679 --> 00:10:06.679
And even then,

00:10:06.679 --> 00:10:08.679
if it's something negative,

00:10:08.679 --> 00:10:10.679
we wouldn't want to spread it.

00:10:10.679 --> 00:10:13.679
Any more than we want something spread about ourselves.

00:10:13.679 --> 00:10:19.779
I'm going to consider that.

00:10:19.779 --> 00:10:23.340
Thanks.

00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:25.340
I'm going to apologise to Harry and Marie

00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:30.649
and have Emily talk directly to Haley.

00:10:30.649 --> 00:10:33.960
Good idea.

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:48.620
Yes, Nana?

00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:49.620
Don't forget eggs to you.

00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:50.620
No, no, I didn't forget.

00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:51.620
Are you sure?

00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:52.620
No, I won't forget.

00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:53.620
Okay.

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:54.620
Okay, love you.

00:10:54.620 --> 00:11:12.490
Yeah, I've caught you.

00:11:12.490 --> 00:11:13.490
Do you have a minute?

00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:14.490
Hi, Emily.

00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:16.490
Can we talk later?

00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:18.490
I'm really struggling this morning.

00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:19.490
Do you know?

00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:20.490
It's just...

00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:22.490
You've been so busy and I've been waiting for the right moment.

00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:25.490
I really just like to address it.

00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:28.490
Okay, what's up?

00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:33.490
It's just that I've noticed you were post-lately on quick posts.

00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:34.490
What about them?

00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:37.490
Well, do you really think there's something

00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:39.490
that a pioneer should be posting?

00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:42.490
Wait, what are you talking about?

00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:45.490
Some people might think you're bragging.

00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:46.490
Some people.

00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:47.490
What people?

00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:48.490
It's a business account.

00:11:48.490 --> 00:11:49.490
I've got to show off my product.

00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:50.490
I know, I get that.

00:11:50.490 --> 00:11:51.490
It's just...

00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:52.490
I don't know.

00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:54.490
It could feel like you're drawing a little too much attention to yourself.

00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:55.490
Who would think like that?

00:11:55.490 --> 00:11:56.490
You.

00:11:56.490 --> 00:11:57.490
No.

00:11:57.490 --> 00:11:58.490
Not just me.

00:11:58.490 --> 00:11:59.490
It's Celia felt the same.

00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:01.490
You spoke to Celia about this.

00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:04.860
I didn't want to upset you.

00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:07.860
Jake said that I needed to say such everyone.

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:09.860
I think it's my poster in a proof.

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:11.860
Not everyone, Haley.

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:13.860
That's not what I'm saying at all.

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:15.860
You are such...

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:26.259
I'm just trying to help you if you were just listen to me.

00:12:26.259 --> 00:12:27.259
You're just...

00:12:27.259 --> 00:12:28.259
You're just...

00:12:28.259 --> 00:12:30.259
Oh, yeah, listen to me.

00:12:30.259 --> 00:12:33.830
And I expected more from you.

00:12:33.830 --> 00:12:36.830
Haley, what are you talking about?

00:12:36.830 --> 00:12:37.830
Gossiping.

00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:39.830
About my posts.

00:12:39.830 --> 00:12:47.580
You're that lonely that you've got nothing better to do.

00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:48.580
Haley?
