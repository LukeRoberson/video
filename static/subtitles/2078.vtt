00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:17.800
The Bethel Complex at Wal-Kill, New York is home to a printing operation that each year produces

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:25.800
in ships some 25 million pieces of Bible literature in over 175 languages.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:32.799
But today's large-scale operation at Wal-Kill had small beginnings, beginning stretching

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:34.799
back 50 years.

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:46.340
The Bellenora said around in this early 60s sometime about looking at getting another farm.

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:56.159
So one Saturday morning I called brother Lars and I said brother Lars and you won't take a trip with me.

00:00:56.159 --> 00:01:05.159
We only had brother and sister Dave Walker here at first and we had to feel the boys from Mountain Farm.

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:16.159
We wanted the farm for a hog house, a cow barn, the raised beef, the garden, milk house, all the things.

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:20.159
This was permanently going to be a farm close to New York.

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:36.459
This new property came to be known as Watchtower Farms.

00:01:36.459 --> 00:01:47.090
The first residence building was completed in 1968.

00:01:47.090 --> 00:02:00.140
In 1970 work began on a new building to house extensive printing facilities.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:08.889
Printing began with the March 1st 1973 issue of the Watchtower magazine.

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:15.889
In 1979 design began on the multi-language electronic publishing system known as MEPS.

00:02:15.889 --> 00:02:36.689
To date this computer system has contributed to the production of publications in over 700 languages.

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:44.689
Today with printing operations in full swing, Wallkill continues to function as a farm.

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:51.689
For five decades the complex at Wallkill has provided physical food for those working at Bethel.

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:59.689
And since 1973 it continues to produce spiritual nourishment for those yearning to hear the Bible's message.
