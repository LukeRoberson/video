00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:08.679
and in production the 2nd Corinthians. Paul wrote his 2nd inspired letter to the

00:00:08.679 --> 00:00:17.179
Corinthians some months after the congregation received his first. Titus had

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:21.179
been sent to Corinth to assist in the collection for the brothers in Judea and

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:26.579
possibly also to observe the Corinthians reaction to Paul's first inspired

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:34.020
letter to them. When Titus left Corinth, he traveled to meet Paul. Because Titus

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.700
brought a good report, Paul rejoiced and wrote to the Corinthians yet again.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:49.140
2 Corinthians has 13 chapters. In chapter 1, Paul refers to Jehovah as the

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.700
father of tender mercies and the God of all comfort who comforts us in all our

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:01.979
trials. In chapter 2, Paul reassures the congregation of his love for them,

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:08.459
mindful of the strong counsel he gave them in his first inspired letter. The

00:01:08.459 --> 00:01:12.340
wrongdoer who had been expelled from the congregation has now changed his ways

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:20.060
and should be forgiven and welcomed back. In chapter 3, Paul writes that being

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:27.409
adequately qualified as ministers comes from God. Chapter 4 describes the

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:33.969
ministry of the new covenant as a treasure in earthen vessels. Although we are

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:39.370
simply imperfect earthen vessels, the message we preach can bring everlasting

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:47.849
life to us and to those who listen to us. In chapter 5, Paul states, the love the

00:01:47.849 --> 00:01:54.090
Christ has compels us. We cannot accept the extraordinary love of Christ without

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:00.290
feeling compelled to live for him. His love motivates us to imitate his example.

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:07.180
Chapter 6 explains that fellowship between one who is a true Christian and one who

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:12.659
is not would be an uneven yoke. It could result only in harm to the Christian's

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:24.539
faith. Chapter 7 contrasts Godly sadness with the sadness of the world. Godly

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:30.099
sadness results when a person sees wrongdoing as a sin against God. This moves

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:36.780
the person to seek forgiveness and turn from his wrong course. The sadness of the

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:42.939
world is different. In this case, although a person may be sad that his wrongdoing

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:51.659
was exposed, he has no desire to gain God's forgiveness. In chapters 8 and 9, Paul

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:56.620
encourages the Corinthians to follow through with the relief ministry to help the

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:06.590
brothers experiencing adversity in Judea. Did you know? Paul used forms of the

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.949
same Greek word for ministry to describe the preaching and teaching work as

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:16.469
well as the work of providing relief. Thus, relief work is part of a Christian

00:03:16.469 --> 00:03:23.379
sacred service to Jehovah. Because of the bad influence of false apostles,

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:30.460
arguments are set forth in chapters 10 to 13 to counteract their teaching. Paul

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:35.659
reminds the congregation that scriptural truth can overturn strongly entrenched

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:45.509
doctrines, practices, and attitudes that reflect imperfect human wisdom. As you

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:51.349
read 2 Corinthians, note how Jehovah, the God of all comfort, strengthens and

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:56.949
sustains his servants. How genuine repentance leads to friendship with God. And

00:03:56.949 --> 00:04:02.430
how even fragile humans can proclaim the good news of God's kingdom.
