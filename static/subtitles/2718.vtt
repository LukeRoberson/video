00:00:01.169 --> 00:00:04.169
During the time when the Bible was written,

00:00:04.169 --> 00:00:09.169
many people had mistaken ideas about the shape of the earth.

00:00:10.169 --> 00:00:13.169
A theory written after the Bible was completed

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:17.170
was that the universe emerged from a cosmic egg

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.170
and that the earth is supported by various creatures.

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.170
In contrast, about the year 1473 BCE,

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.170
Moses wrote that the earth is suspended upon nothing.

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.170
And around the year 732 BCE,

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:38.170
the prophet Isaiah wrote that the earth is a circle or sphere.

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:43.170
These Bible writers contradicted ideas that were popular at the time.

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.170
It was some 200 years after Isaiah's day

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.170
that the Greek philosopher, Pythagoras,

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.170
may have proposed that the earth is a sphere.

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.170
And more than 3000 years passed

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.170
from Moses' writing until scientists, such as Isaac Newton,

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.170
realized that the earth seemed to hang upon nothing.
