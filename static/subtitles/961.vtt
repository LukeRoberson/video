00:00:01.229 --> 00:00:04.669
Pursuing peace can be a challenge.

00:00:04.669 --> 00:00:08.830
Because of our imperfections and the complexities of life,

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:13.230
we have to work for peace, even under normal conditions.

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.870
But pursuing peace becomes a greater challenge when it's one-sided.

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:22.789
Difficult these arise in the family and in the congregation

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:26.789
when one person pursues peace, but the other does not.

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.390
For example, in the congregation, perhaps we have a friend

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:33.990
who has a problem with another friend in the congregation,

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:37.350
but does not do anything to reconcile the situation.

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.829
Or in the family, a Christian mate may have difficulty pursuing peace

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:46.869
if his or her spouse does not apply Bible principles.

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:48.909
Well, what do we do then?

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:54.229
Well, in those situations, the Bible account of Abigail may be helpful.

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:58.310
And invite you to turn in your Bibles through 1 Samuel, chapter 25.

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:02.630
And here we're introduced to Abigail and her husband, Nebel.

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:07.150
And you notice here in verse 3, Nebel is described as harsh.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:12.310
In verse 25, Abigail describes him as senseless.

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.430
In verse 17, his own worker describes him as worthless

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.510
and says nobody can speak with him.

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.870
Well, with a personality like that,

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:27.189
it's not surprising that his name is Streets, David's young man.

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:30.430
And now David wants revenge.

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:35.230
How do you pursue peace in a situation like that?

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:37.670
What does Abigail do?

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.510
Well, you think about it, what she could have done.

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.870
See, Abigail could have done nothing.

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.230
It's not hard to imagine that she had a difficult life

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:48.989
as well living with this man.

00:01:48.989 --> 00:01:52.069
She could have just stepped back, let David come through

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:54.030
and do what he had in mind.

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.349
Or she could have gone out to David

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.109
and inflamed the situation,

00:01:58.109 --> 00:02:00.469
maybe describing what a terrible man he is

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:03.469
and how he mistreats her as well.

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:07.909
See, either these approaches could have made her life easier

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:09.789
but she didn't do that.

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:13.469
Now, Abigail could not change her husband's ways

00:02:13.469 --> 00:02:18.229
but she did what she could to diffuse an escalating conflict.

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:21.349
In fact, notice her respectful, well chosen words.

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:23.909
Let's go back to 1 Samuel 25

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:29.259
and let's read verses 27 through 31.

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:31.939
Now, let this gift that your servant girl

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:34.539
has brought to my Lord be given to the young man

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:36.860
who are following my Lord.

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.699
Pardon please, the transgression of your servant girl.

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:42.740
For Jehovah will without fail,

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.620
make for my Lord a lasting house

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.099
because my Lord is fighting the wars of Jehovah

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:52.939
and no evil has been found in you all your days.

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:57.740
When someone rises up to pursue you and seeks your life,

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.659
the life of my Lord will be wrapped securely

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:03.939
in the bag of life with Jehovah your God.

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:05.699
But the lives of your enemies,

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:08.500
he will hurl away like stones from a sling.

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:11.180
And when Jehovah has done for my Lord

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.340
all the good things he has promised

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.780
and he points you as leader over Israel,

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.460
you will have no remorse or regret in your heart

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:22.819
for shedding blood without cause

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:26.259
and for letting the hand of my Lord take revenge.

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:30.060
When Jehovah confers good upon my Lord,

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.060
remember your servant girl.

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.020
And do you notice what Abigail does?

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:37.020
She comes in with the gift.

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:38.979
She bows down to David.

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:42.139
She takes the blame for the situation herself

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:46.060
and she reasons with him using godly principles.

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:51.860
Abigail's actions calm David and a verdict calamity.

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.300
She pursued peace.

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:59.099
But to do that she had to look beyond her own feelings

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:02.180
and consider what was best for Jehovah's name.

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.699
And that is not always easy to do.

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:06.259
But what was the result?

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:09.460
Because she sowed peace, she pursued peace,

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:11.099
she reaped peace.

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.819
How can we benefit from Abigail's example?

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:18.740
Why is it important to do so now?

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:26.889
Let's look at the following dramatization.

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.370
And later on, when things got even more intense,

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.370
that's when our peace was really put to the test.

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:41.329
Yeah, but Tim, you always found a way to keep us positive.

00:04:41.329 --> 00:04:45.850
Well, I learned a lot about that from my better half.

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:48.970
Amy's always had a way of bringing people together.

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:52.170
For example, just before the pandemic,

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:55.490
there were these two pioneer sisters in our congregation.

00:04:55.529 --> 00:04:59.329
Becky was energetic, industrious, and fearless

00:04:59.329 --> 00:05:01.089
in her ministry.

00:05:01.089 --> 00:05:05.050
And Lena experienced self-sacrificing

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:06.730
and such a good Bible teacher.

00:05:08.209 --> 00:05:10.810
But they didn't exactly get along.

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:28.310
You ready to go?

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:29.310
Are you okay?

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:31.870
It's just, it's Becky.

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:34.829
She's just such a phantom pioneer.

00:05:34.829 --> 00:05:37.029
We never see her.

00:05:37.149 --> 00:05:39.389
I'm sorry, but she just needs me to be serious

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:40.870
about her ministry.

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:42.750
Oh, she's been doing nitro witnessing.

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:45.389
I know, I know, an LDC, too, right?

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:49.029
She does plumbing, concrete.

00:05:49.029 --> 00:05:51.110
She does have a lot of energy.

00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:55.149
I remember when we used to be like that.

00:05:55.149 --> 00:05:57.670
I don't know that I was ever like Becky.

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:59.389
No, you weren't.

00:05:59.389 --> 00:06:01.350
You were Becky or the Becky.

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:02.670
I couldn't keep up with you.

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:05.589
Those long service days in your little red car.

00:06:05.629 --> 00:06:12.939
That feels like a long time ago.

00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:15.980
You know, Becky reminds me a lot of you.

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:19.660
I mean, both of us, 20 years ago.

00:06:20.939 --> 00:06:23.060
She's working so hard,

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:26.779
and she's made so many sacrifices for the truth,

00:06:26.779 --> 00:06:27.779
just like you have.

00:06:30.339 --> 00:06:33.220
I think we should get together, the three of us.

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:40.680
You should get to know her better.

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:43.439
The next week, I had them both over to the house.

00:06:45.439 --> 00:06:47.759
And the more those two got to know each other,

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:53.459
the closer they became.

00:06:53.459 --> 00:06:56.819
You know that proverb, the tongue of the wise is a healing.

00:06:58.139 --> 00:07:00.500
Amy taught me what that verse really means.

00:07:02.939 --> 00:07:05.100
Okay, everyone out.

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:15.009
When everything changed,

00:07:15.009 --> 00:07:17.410
and we suddenly found ourselves locked up together,

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:20.290
I tried to show that same spirit

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:23.290
so that we could stay united.

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:35.930
And with Jehovah's help, we did.

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:45.110
Now, did you notice what our sister did and did not do?

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:47.110
And she could have done nothing.

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:50.110
She could have let Lena, her service partner,

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:52.110
cultivate those thoughts about Becky.

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:56.110
Or Amy could have poured fuel on the situation,

00:07:56.110 --> 00:07:58.110
maybe agreeing with Lena,

00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:01.110
or telling a few stories how Becky annoyed her as well.

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:03.110
But she did not do that.

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:09.029
See, Amy's desire to sow peace moved her to help Lena

00:08:09.029 --> 00:08:11.709
see things from a different perspective.

00:08:11.709 --> 00:08:16.709
And as a result, the congregation benefited and reaped peace.

00:08:17.509 --> 00:08:20.990
Notice how the Apostle Paul explains this approach

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:22.230
that we should take.

00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:26.589
If you turn to your Bibles to Romans, chapter 12 and verse 18.

00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:30.509
Romans, chapter 12 and verse 18.

00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:35.190
If possible, as far as it depends on you,

00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:37.470
be peaceable with all men.

00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:41.870
As far as it depends on you.

00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:45.029
See, our congregations, our families benefit

00:08:45.029 --> 00:08:50.029
when we sow seeds of peace before matters get out of hand.

00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:53.149
It's like seeing a small fire in our house.

00:08:53.149 --> 00:08:54.350
What do we do?

00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:56.029
Do we just ignore it?

00:08:56.029 --> 00:08:57.509
And hope it goes away?

00:08:57.509 --> 00:08:59.309
Do we fan the flames?

00:08:59.309 --> 00:09:00.389
Do we put fuel on it?

00:09:00.389 --> 00:09:01.389
No, we do something.

00:09:01.389 --> 00:09:02.149
Why?

00:09:02.149 --> 00:09:05.070
Because we know that if left unchecked,

00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:07.870
that fire could destroy our home.

00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:11.110
Well, as similar when we see problems

00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:13.669
that develop in peace being disrupted,

00:09:13.669 --> 00:09:14.509
we do the same.

00:09:14.509 --> 00:09:15.350
Why?

00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:17.750
Because we know that if we don't do something,

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:19.990
and if it's left unchecked,

00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:24.990
that disturbance could destroy our family and the congregation.

00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:27.149
So the question is,

00:09:27.149 --> 00:09:30.750
is how do we sow seeds of peace?

00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:32.190
Well, Abigail was a good example.

00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:33.750
Did you notice what she did?

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:37.110
Is she considered how best to approach the situation?

00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:38.789
She was proactive.

00:09:38.789 --> 00:09:41.950
She didn't just hope it would go away on its own.

00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:45.590
She used respectful, soothing speech.

00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:50.269
She was careful not to fan the flames or add fuel to it.

00:09:50.269 --> 00:09:52.789
Oh, good steps we can take.

00:09:52.789 --> 00:09:55.429
And we have other resources to help us as well.

00:09:55.429 --> 00:09:59.230
We can do research in the Bible and in our publications

00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:02.909
to see how others have sowed peace in similar situations.

00:10:02.909 --> 00:10:05.669
And we can also consult with the elders.

00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:11.190
Now, we understand that this is especially a challenge

00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:16.190
if the situation is in the family as it was for Abigail.

00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:18.629
That is not easy at all.

00:10:18.629 --> 00:10:20.470
And in those situations,

00:10:20.509 --> 00:10:24.110
try to focus on your mate's good qualities,

00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:28.070
not on his or her irritating traits.

00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:31.350
But with all of this, we have to be realistic.

00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:32.990
Remember what the Apostle Paul said there

00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:35.070
is recorded in verse 18?

00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:40.070
He says, if possible, as far as it depends on you.

00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:44.110
So Paul was acknowledging that peace with others

00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:46.830
may not always be possible.

00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:48.269
So what do we do?

00:10:48.309 --> 00:10:50.629
We have to do the best that we can.

00:10:50.629 --> 00:10:53.230
And then we leave the rest in Jehovah's hands.

00:10:54.149 --> 00:10:58.669
So may we be determined to develop the practice

00:10:58.669 --> 00:11:01.350
of pursuing peace now.

00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:04.470
At whether we're in the congregation or in the family,

00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:07.629
we can be confident that if we sow peace,

00:11:07.629 --> 00:11:11.669
we will reap peace even if others don't respond.

00:11:11.669 --> 00:11:12.789
How?

00:11:12.789 --> 00:11:14.629
Well, we'll have peace with Jehovah,

00:11:14.629 --> 00:11:17.269
peace with ourselves and the knowledge

00:11:17.269 --> 00:11:19.549
that we did the right thing.

00:11:19.549 --> 00:11:22.830
Additionally, when in the future,

00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:26.309
