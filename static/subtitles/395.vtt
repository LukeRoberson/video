00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.830
Our scripture texts is Matthew 10, 16.

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:06.710
We invite you to open to Matthew chapter 10.

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:10.830
We'll take a look at our text in the context.

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:14.269
Now, if you notice in the first few verses,

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:17.350
the 12 apostles are listed, but look at verse five.

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.390
These 12 Jesus sent out giving them these instructions.

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:25.949
And the instructions, as you'll see,

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.870
it included that initially just go to the house of Israel.

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:31.390
If you look at verse seven, it says,

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.829
preach the kingdom of the heavens.

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:34.869
Verse eight says,

00:00:34.869 --> 00:00:39.469
cure people, raise some dead ones, expel demons.

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:41.630
And then if you look at verse nine and 10,

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:45.469
it tells them to how their ministry's gonna be financed,

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:47.909
primarily by contributions.

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:49.789
And then verse 11 through 14,

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:51.469
he tells them about their territory.

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:54.789
He alludes to the door to door, house to housework,

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:59.829
how to follow up on interest, how to handle rejection.

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:03.670
But now we come to verse 16,

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.069
and it's a continuation of this meeting for service.

00:01:08.069 --> 00:01:10.709
And now Jesus tells them something

00:01:10.709 --> 00:01:13.430
that might be a little more intimidating

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.030
when they think about their upcoming role.

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.870
And so let's read verse 16 and its entirety.

00:01:20.629 --> 00:01:25.390
Look, I'm sending you out as sheep among wolves.

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.390
So prove yourselves cautious as serpents,

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.189
yet innocent as does.

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:33.750
So that was Jesus' introduction

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.390
to the following circumstances.

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.150
Look at verse 17.

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.989
You'll be handed over to courts and scourged.

00:01:41.989 --> 00:01:46.230
18 brought before governors and kings for being Christians.

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:49.469
Well, that was a lot for the apostles to absorb.

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:53.269
And we can just imagine them looking each other nervously,

00:01:53.269 --> 00:01:56.030
maybe some anxiety playing over their face.

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:58.349
His followers, though,

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.909
came to understand what Jesus meant in verse 16.

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.950
He used four different animal types.

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:11.870
He said, I'm sending you out as sheep among wolves.

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.150
Well, they would have immediately understood that illustration.

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.710
That was used in the Hebrew scriptures.

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:20.789
Psalm 100 verse three says,

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:24.110
we are his people, the sheep of his pastry, they understood.

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.069
And they would have understood the analogy of wolves.

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:31.310
They knew wolves were vicious predators on sheep,

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.270
so they got the picture.

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.990
We're not going to be well received by awe.

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:39.750
It was Jesus' way of warning them of potential trouble.

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.150
Well, what about this other analogy of serpents and doves?

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:49.270
You know, being described as a snake

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.430
was not complimentary back then, nor is it today.

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.830
So, why did Jesus say that?

00:02:56.669 --> 00:02:59.110
You know, probably the reason why it's not complimentary

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.430
is the original serpents reputation

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.870
when he wreaked havoc on the human race.

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:10.870
But our text says, be like serpents in what way.

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.310
Remember, Genesis described the serpent

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:18.110
as the most cautious of all the animals Jehovah had made.

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.870
That natural characteristic

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:23.870
is which Jesus was highlighting for his followers.

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.550
They were to be cautious in the ministry

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:29.430
particularly when facing opposition.

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.229
Well, our snakes really cautious.

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:36.669
You know, many of us don't even like to look at a snake,

00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:40.509
let alone carefully study its personality characteristics.

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.750
So, I'm going to quote a British zoologist.

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.990
He said that even when attacking an enemy,

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:50.789
a serpent is cautious.

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.069
He tries to make sure that his strike

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:57.830
is going to be accurate and deadly.

00:03:58.789 --> 00:04:00.909
And so, the zoologist said,

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:04.229
often they'll make several lunges toward the enemy

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:08.069
and yet they fall short on purpose.

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:11.389
And sometimes when they make their lunges,

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:12.509
they don't even open their mouth.

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:13.909
Why?

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:17.470
Because it's just practicing, it's being cautious.

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:23.069
And the same zoologist said that oftentimes at this point,

00:04:23.069 --> 00:04:28.069
you can see the snake sometimes carefully uncoiling himself

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:30.709
of being ready for a hasty departure

00:04:30.709 --> 00:04:33.149
if the enemy's too aggressive in return.

00:04:34.069 --> 00:04:35.949
The snake is being cautious.

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.470
And remember, Jesus was involved in the creation

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.470
of the serpent, so he would have well known

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:44.069
this cautious nature.

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:45.990
And that's what he said his followers

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.269
should try to include in their personality

00:04:49.269 --> 00:04:50.990
is exercising cautious,

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:55.029
particularly when facing wolf-like opposition.

00:04:55.029 --> 00:04:58.910
Well, how did Jesus balance that characteristic

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:02.110
by including the dove in the illustration?

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:06.310
Well, if we were all serpent and no dove,

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:12.310
then much of the warmth of sharing the good news would be lost.

00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:14.949
So Jesus included the dove.

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:17.389
And what's the natural characteristic of the dove?

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:22.870
Well, a dove is so soft, gentling appearance,

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:25.310
it has an appealing disposition.

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:27.949
In fact, the dove is so gentle and appealing

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:30.910
that it has actually earned the description

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:36.670
of being the sheep of the bird wool world.

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:39.509
So what an appropriate way for Jehovah to describe

00:05:39.509 --> 00:05:42.069
this other aspect of his followers.

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:46.149
But what's the downside of being all,

00:05:46.149 --> 00:05:48.709
lovey-dovey, no serpent?

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:51.389
Insight says,

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:54.149
does are quite trusting of humans

00:05:54.149 --> 00:05:58.910
and are rather easily entrapped or snared with a net.

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:00.790
So Jesus added this equation,

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:03.750
be cautious as serpents.

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:08.189
So in this way, our gentle Christian personality

00:06:08.189 --> 00:06:09.670
will not be taken advantage of.

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:12.990
We will not easily be trapped or ensnared.

00:06:14.149 --> 00:06:20.689
When we brought you to turn to Mark chapter 12,

00:06:20.689 --> 00:06:23.490
now we know that Jesus had dove like qualities.

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:26.290
He was gentle, he was kind, he was compassionate.

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:29.930
But was he cautious as a serpent?

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:31.170
Well, if you look at Mark 12,

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:33.290
the last sentence in verse 14,

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:38.290
is it lawful to pay head tax to Caesar or not?

00:06:39.209 --> 00:06:44.209
Well, these proud Jewish religious Pharisees,

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:47.209
they were trying to trap Jesus,

00:06:47.209 --> 00:06:50.490
get in to say something against Roman nationalism.

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:55.529
Well, the direct answer to that question

00:06:55.529 --> 00:06:59.329
from an innocent dove would be,

00:06:59.329 --> 00:07:02.810
yes, it's proper to pay taxes to Rome.

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:06.050
But that would have been a volatile response

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:08.290
as far as the Pharisees were concerned.

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:11.569
So notice how Jesus used caution,

00:07:11.569 --> 00:07:14.449
cautious as a serpent, verses 15 to 17,

00:07:14.449 --> 00:07:17.730
the Pharisees asked, should we pay or should we not pay?

00:07:18.689 --> 00:07:22.129
Well, detecting their hypocrisy, he said to them,

00:07:22.129 --> 00:07:24.129
why do you put me to the test?

00:07:24.129 --> 00:07:26.769
Bring me a denarius to look at.

00:07:26.769 --> 00:07:28.889
They brought him one and he said to them,

00:07:28.889 --> 00:07:31.689
whose image and inscription is this?

00:07:32.889 --> 00:07:34.769
They said to him, Caesars,

00:07:35.649 --> 00:07:40.329
Jesus then said, pay back Caesar's things to Caesar,

00:07:40.329 --> 00:07:45.329
but God's things to God, and they were amazed at him.

00:07:45.769 --> 00:07:47.410
They were amazed at him.

00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:50.649
Now, if he had innocently said, yes,

00:07:50.649 --> 00:07:53.649
pay the Romans the tax, they would have been infuriated,

00:07:53.649 --> 00:07:55.089
not amazed.

00:07:55.089 --> 00:08:01.199
Jesus defused the situation by using caution.

00:08:01.199 --> 00:08:03.199
Or what are some situations we might face

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:05.720
to be prudent, exercise caution?

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:09.240
Well, what is our conversations?

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:13.759
We need to avoid either praising or criticizing

00:08:13.759 --> 00:08:17.720
the policy of a political party or leader.

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:19.600
I'll follow in Jesus' example.

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:21.720
The comments are Romans 13.

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:25.439
We are to be respectful of superior authority,

00:08:25.439 --> 00:08:29.079
even if it's dishonest, corrupt, inept.

00:08:30.079 --> 00:08:33.679
At one brother, I won't say which country he's from,

00:08:33.679 --> 00:08:37.840
but he recently told me he said the greatest challenge

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:42.360
to my neutrality is not saying something negative

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:43.799
about the current government.

00:08:44.639 --> 00:08:46.559
I think we understand.

00:08:46.559 --> 00:08:49.720
Well, this is also true when speaking to refugees.

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:51.960
Many countries have thousands of refugees

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:55.639
pouring into their land because of opposition

00:08:55.639 --> 00:08:58.440
from some regime, ethnic attacks.

00:08:58.799 --> 00:09:01.679
And these ones likely are seething in pain

00:09:01.679 --> 00:09:05.279
and they want to talk about, besmirch the regime

00:09:05.279 --> 00:09:07.960
that's pushed them out of the country.

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:10.519
So how can we share the good news like a dove

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:15.879
and yet be cautious as serpents?

00:09:15.879 --> 00:09:17.960
Well, we need to be patient like a dove,

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:20.279
listen to the refugee and they will likely

00:09:20.279 --> 00:09:22.360
tell some of their horrors,

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:25.440
but now we need to be cautious as a serpent

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:29.200
by avoid getting involved in a discussion

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:31.519
of the political elements involved.

00:09:31.519 --> 00:09:34.039
Instead, follow the directions of the branch office,

00:09:34.039 --> 00:09:35.759
share the good news in such a way

00:09:35.759 --> 00:09:39.720
so as not to put yourself or others at risk.

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:41.960
And when talking to refugees,

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:44.039
it's good to exercise caution

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:50.200
when it comes to our clothing, jewelry, and our grooming,

00:09:50.759 --> 00:09:53.320
so that we're not offensive to their culture.

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:57.840
For example, in Myanmar, if a woman's clothing reveals,

00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:02.240
exposes her shoulder, that's viewed as quite offensive.

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:04.320
So when we're talking to refugees,

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:07.200
we need to be mindful of customs like that.

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:08.360
Well, how about the media?

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:13.440
Is there a need to be cautious as serpents?

00:10:14.759 --> 00:10:15.919
Well, you know, in some lands,

00:10:15.919 --> 00:10:20.080
they have state-controlled news reports

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:22.879
that are blatantly slanted.

00:10:22.879 --> 00:10:25.960
And sometimes your hope as witnesses

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:29.279
are slandered or ridiculous charges

00:10:29.279 --> 00:10:31.559
are trumped up against them.

00:10:31.559 --> 00:10:34.480
A dove could be ensnared by these reports,

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:37.960
start to tremble, but because of this council

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:41.480
from Jesus to also be cautious as serpents,

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:43.320
then we're not easily duped.

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:47.559
And how about, even in a free country,

00:10:47.559 --> 00:10:50.320
what about the news media in a free country?

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:53.759
Christians need to be careful not to adopt

00:10:53.759 --> 00:10:57.399
the bias of a particular news commentator.

00:10:57.399 --> 00:10:58.799
And instead of getting involved

00:10:58.799 --> 00:11:03.440
in the political leanings of that news broadcast,

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:06.039
we should remember the words of Paul

00:11:06.039 --> 00:11:08.120
at 2 Timothy 1-13.

00:11:09.559 --> 00:11:11.559
2 Timothy 1-13, he said,

00:11:11.559 --> 00:11:15.919
keep holding to the standard of wholesome words,

00:11:17.159 --> 00:11:22.159
with the faith and love that result from union with Christ Jesus.

00:11:23.759 --> 00:11:25.840
So in harmony with our text today,

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:28.399
if we're in union with Christ Jesus,

00:11:28.399 --> 00:11:32.440
then we need to prove ourselves cautious as serpents,

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:34.399
but innocent as doves.
