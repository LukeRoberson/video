WEBVTT

00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:08.900
We're so happy to have you join us again here on J.W. Broadcasting. In the

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:14.980
next hour we'll talk about how to become a better teacher of God's Word. And we

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:20.420
also joined the land in Isaac for some candid talk about the peer pressure

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:26.839
they faced in high school. We'll see an interview with Maria Kaloyanov, who

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:31.579
smuggled hundreds of pieces of Bible literature into communist Europe during

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:39.000
the 1960s. What motivated this young mother to risk imprisonment again and

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.799
again? And we'll enjoy a beautiful new music video that highlights how much

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:51.600
Jehovah appreciates the quality of our sacrifices even if we're limited and what

00:00:51.600 --> 00:01:18.280
we can do. This is the August 2023 edition of J.W. Broadcasting. How important

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:24.359
is the use of illustrations? Are they simply fluff in our teaching? One

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:30.719
definition of the English word fluff is this, something essentially trivial

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:37.480
and lacking importance or solid worth. Our illustrations trivial and of little

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:47.400
worth. Please follow along on screen as I read our theme scripture, Matthew 1334.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:54.359
All these things Jesus spoke to the crowds by illustrations. Indeed, without an

00:01:54.359 --> 00:02:01.799
illustration, he would not speak to them. We often call Jesus the great teacher.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:08.560
Illustrations were essential to fully grasp what was being taught. Now we

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.479
won't be spending a lot of time on the do's and don'ts of using illustrations.

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:19.840
Insight on the scriptures has a whole topic on illustrations and the apply

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.080
yourself to reading and teaching brochure has some helpful suggestions in lesson

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.680
eight. Let me remind you also of a talk that Brother

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:36.759
Splain of the governing body gave at the 2020 regional convention. The title was

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:42.719
improve your skills illustrating key points. It had some very practical

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:47.840
suggestions which I won't be repeating here. So perhaps you'll want to review

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:55.319
Brother Splain's talk in an upcoming family worship. At times the Bible actually

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:02.840
identifies Jesus expression as an illustration. Most of the time it does not. It

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.360
was just part of the way he spoke naturally. Illustrations flowed from him.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:15.969
Well, how did he come up with them so readily? Jesus was observant of what was

00:03:15.969 --> 00:03:22.210
happening around him. We too can be observant. This will help to train us to

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:27.969
think in illustrations. The bread and the wine used at the memorial of Christ

00:03:27.969 --> 00:03:32.969
death beautifully represented Jesus' perfect body and blood that would be

00:03:32.969 --> 00:03:39.289
given in behalf of sinful mankind. But we can learn something about our use of

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:44.250
illustrations by considering the circumstances of the Lord's evening meal.

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:51.530
Think about it. From years of attending Jesus knew what was going to be on the

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:57.530
Passover table that night. So he could have thought in advance of using those

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:03.810
emblems in that way. We don't know for sure. But what a simple logical and

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:10.090
indelible impression it made that night and continues to make on millions of

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:16.329
us some 2,000 years later. If we're going to give a talk or demonstration at

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:21.670
one of our meetings, we already know the topic. So we have the luxury of

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:27.970
thinking of an illustration in advance. But what if we're teaching a Bible

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:34.490
student and he asks us an unexpected question? At that moment you're likely

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:40.370
mentally consider your student, what you know about his work, his hobbies, or just

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:45.970
his daily life experiences, and an illustration may come to your mind on the

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:52.009
spur of the moment. Well, let's see how that latter process, an unexpected

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:59.290
situation, was faced by Jesus. In this case, we can understand his thought process

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:06.529
and coming up with masterful illustrations. In John chapter 4, he's the

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:12.050
count about the Samaritan woman at the well. John 434, Jesus used the

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:19.649
illustration of food. He said there, my food is to do the will of him who sent

00:05:19.649 --> 00:05:27.610
me and to finish his work. That's a simple, effective illustration. Why might he

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:33.769
have used the generic expression food instead of something more specific like

00:05:33.769 --> 00:05:40.209
my wine or my bread is to do the will of him who sent me? Well, let's look at

00:05:40.209 --> 00:05:46.810
the context. Interestingly, in quick succession, Jesus used two different

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:52.930
illustrations and in both cases, it seems from the context that he came up with

00:05:52.930 --> 00:06:00.329
these based on what was happening at the time. John 4.7 says, a woman of

00:06:00.329 --> 00:06:08.930
Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to her, give me a drink. Well, that set up

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:16.209
number one for an illustration about water. Verse 8 says, for his disciples had

00:06:16.209 --> 00:06:23.129
gone off into the city to buy food. That set up number two for an illustration

00:06:23.129 --> 00:06:29.490
about food. Now, Jesus didn't orchestrate all of this in advance. It was just

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:34.889
circumstantial that Jesus asked a woman who approached with a water jar to give

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:42.490
him a drink. But Jesus instantly thought and used the subject of water as an

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:51.649
illustration. Verse 10 says, if you had known of the free gift of God and who it is

00:06:51.649 --> 00:06:57.370
who says to you, give me a drink, you would have asked him and he would have given

00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:04.970
you living water. The illustration was spontaneous. It effectively led to a

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:13.769
fine witness about Jesus. Now, illustration number two, look at verse 27. Jesus

00:07:13.769 --> 00:07:19.329
is still talking to the woman when the disciples returned from the city. I do

00:07:19.329 --> 00:07:23.730
remember that verse 8 said that the disciples had gone into the city to buy

00:07:24.329 --> 00:07:32.970
food. So they come back and they have some food for Jesus. Going to verse 28, the

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:38.209
woman leaves, notice the disciples now say to Jesus, which is a set up for

00:07:38.209 --> 00:07:45.170
illustration number two. Not water, but food now becomes the topic of conversation.

00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:54.529
Verse 31. Meanwhile, the disciples were urging him, rabbi, eat. The word eat

00:07:54.529 --> 00:07:59.810
caused Jesus to think of the now famous illustration that we quote regularly.

00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:09.290
Verse 32, but he said to them, I have food to eat that you do not know about. Well,

00:08:09.329 --> 00:08:16.370
the disciples are puzzled. Verse 33. So the disciples said to one another, no one

00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:22.129
brought him anything to eat, did he? Jesus picking up on the topic at hand said

00:08:22.129 --> 00:08:28.850
to them, my food is to do the will of him who sent me and finished his work.

00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:35.610
Now, obviously Jesus did not choreograph all this in advance. But based on the

00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:42.450
circumstances at hand, he came up with illustrations that worked well in what

00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:50.169
way? Well, what's the point of similarity between God's will and food? Eating

00:08:50.169 --> 00:08:56.730
good food is enjoyable. It's satisfying. The point, Jesus enjoyed doing God's

00:08:56.730 --> 00:09:03.210
will. It was satisfying to him like eating a tasty meal. Another point of

00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:10.330
similarity. Food invigorates a person. Jesus was invigorated by that

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:15.730
conversation with a Samaritan woman. I'll glance back up at verses three through

00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:25.129
six. Says Jesus had left Judea on foot. Look at verse six. Now, Jesus tired

00:09:25.129 --> 00:09:30.610
out as he was from the journey was sitting at the well. It was about the six

00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:38.490
hour. However, after witnessing to the woman at the well, Jesus is invigorated. He

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:43.409
even alluded to the idea that the experience was more energizing than

00:09:43.409 --> 00:09:51.460
literal food. What if we learned thus far from the process? If you know beforehand,

00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:56.980
what will be discussed, that gives you the opportunity to think of an appropriate

00:09:56.980 --> 00:10:04.299
illustration in advance. If something comes up unexpectedly, often you can use

00:10:04.299 --> 00:10:09.340
what you've observed around you or what you already know to generate an

00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:17.700
effective illustration. You might be thinking, I'm not really creative. It takes a

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:22.500
while for me to think of an illustration, even when I know in advance that I

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:28.259
haven't assignment at the meeting. On the spot illustration, it's probably not

00:10:28.259 --> 00:10:35.659
going to happen for me with the way my brain works or doesn't work. Is there a way

00:10:35.659 --> 00:10:45.059
to train the brain to think in illustration mode? Yes. How? One way is by

00:10:45.059 --> 00:10:51.379
observing creation or man-made inventions, even when you don't have a talk to

00:10:51.379 --> 00:10:57.419
give, even when your children are not with you. Think about what you observe and

00:10:57.419 --> 00:11:03.860
reason out how it could be applied as a teaching lesson in the future. Write it

00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:09.580
down if you need to so as to remember it. One father told me that even when his

00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:15.379
children were not with him, he would look at creation and come up with a line of

00:11:15.379 --> 00:11:22.259
reasoning that might be helpful in the future. And he gave an example. He observed

00:11:22.259 --> 00:11:30.700
two kittens playing together. He reasoned. Do those kittens look happy? Yes. If

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:37.019
Jehovah knows what it takes to make two kittens happy, do you think he knows what

00:11:37.019 --> 00:11:44.259
it would take to make you happy? Well obviously a child would agree. So if Jehovah

00:11:44.259 --> 00:11:50.019
knows what it would take to make you happy, what should you do if Jehovah says to

00:11:50.019 --> 00:11:57.299
do something a certain way? Profound dad, do it Jehovah's way if you want to be

00:11:57.299 --> 00:12:03.820
happy. Now the beautiful reality, the golden moment, was when he saw one of his

00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:09.940
sons watching two squirrels and a tree chasing each other. He used the squirrels

00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:16.419
as his illustration, along with the prepared line of reasoning. Now his son

00:12:16.419 --> 00:12:23.500
still remembers that point many decades later. Jesus' brain thought

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:30.500
creatively when using illustrations. For another example, please turn with me to

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:42.779
John 142. Jesus changed Simon's name on the spot. John 142. And he and

00:12:42.779 --> 00:12:50.539
group led him Simon to Jesus. When Jesus looked at him, he said, you are Simon the

00:12:50.539 --> 00:12:58.460
son of John. You will be called Seifas, which is translated Peter. Now why did

00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:05.179
Jesus change his name to Seifas or Peter? It actually seems to be creative

00:13:05.179 --> 00:13:13.700
thinking. The Greek word for Peter is Petros, not Petra. Petra means rock mass

00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:18.019
and that applies to Jesus, the cornerstone, the head of the Christian

00:13:18.019 --> 00:13:25.019
congregation. However, Petros means a piece of rock. What a beautiful

00:13:25.019 --> 00:13:32.220
description of Peter. At times, Peter didn't seem to be dependable, but Jesus saw

00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:40.019
good qualities in him and gave him the name Peter, Petros, piece of rock. In

00:13:40.019 --> 00:13:46.059
effect, Jesus was saying that he would become as stable as a rock, and that's

00:13:46.059 --> 00:13:54.100
precisely what transpired. What a great word picture or illustration by Jesus. At

00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:59.899
Revelation 11, under inspiration to John, Jehovah said that that book of the

00:13:59.899 --> 00:14:07.580
Bible was a revelation by Jesus Christ, which God gave to him. The insight book

00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:13.379
says, the book of Revelation concludes the Holy Scriptures with one of the most

00:14:13.379 --> 00:14:21.100
outstanding concentrations of illustrations found in the entire Bible. You

00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:27.700
recall our theme is Matthew 1334. Without an illustration, he would not speak to

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:34.659
them. As another example, Jesus gave his famous sermon on the mountain. In Matthew

00:14:34.659 --> 00:14:39.980
chapter 7, the last chapter of that sermon, he used at least 10 different

00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:48.100
illustrations. Yes, without an illustration, he would not speak to them. Matthew

00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:53.860
chapter 728 sums up the sermon on the mountain, saying, when Jesus finished

00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:59.259
these sayings, the effect was that the crowds were astounded at his way of

00:14:59.259 --> 00:15:07.139
teaching. First Peter 221 says that Jesus left a model for us to follow his steps

00:15:07.139 --> 00:15:13.940
closely. That includes his art of teaching, which incorporated extensive use of

00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:20.659
illustrations. They were pithy and to the point. May each of us train ourselves to

00:15:20.659 --> 00:15:25.980
think that way and strive to improve our teaching skills by means of

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:34.559
illustrations. Jesus was able to reach hearts, not only by means of his teaching

00:15:34.559 --> 00:15:42.080
skills, but also because of his outstanding qualities. Think of his empathy, his

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:49.399
compassion, and fellow feeling just drew people to him like a magnet. What role

00:15:49.399 --> 00:15:55.080
can our empathy and fellow feeling play as we preach to others in this

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:59.759
loveless world? Take a look at the following dramatization.

00:15:59.759 --> 00:17:14.000
Okay, and everything, Bagel, with cream cheese and a large lady, 850. Oh, I think I've

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.480
forgot my pores. Not my problem. Come on, I'm young this time. I've been waiting

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:22.599
forever. And yet still not my problem. Are you serious? I can mean you demand

00:17:22.599 --> 00:17:29.440
you have to work. Next customer. Sorry, how much was her order? 850. Oh, I've got it.

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:41.099
And could you add a regular coffee with cream? Fine, 12 even. I just want to help. Thank

00:17:41.099 --> 00:17:46.299
you. Of course. How can I get you money to you? Yeah, don't worry about it. Okay, thank

00:17:46.299 --> 00:18:05.519
you. But if you'd like a little something encouraging to read on your way to work,

00:18:05.519 --> 00:18:39.130
you might enjoy this. I don't believe in God. May I ask why? I just don't. Thanks again.

00:18:39.130 --> 00:19:42.789
You're very sweet. How many years in the camp? 11. Will anyone else in your family be

00:19:42.789 --> 00:20:00.589
requesting resettlement? No. Why? They are all dead. I need a copy of your identity

00:20:00.589 --> 00:22:10.339
card. Never underestimate the power of empathy. Even the smallest gesture of kindness

00:22:10.339 --> 00:22:16.819
on our part can lead to someone opening their heart to the truth. The video also taught

00:22:16.819 --> 00:22:22.619
as something else. The ministry in all of its forms can have a cumulative effect on

00:22:22.619 --> 00:22:30.549
a person's heart, softening it over time to accept the Kingdom message. Of course,

00:22:30.549 --> 00:22:37.069
we have empathy not only for those in the field, but also for our own brothers and sisters.

00:22:37.069 --> 00:22:43.029
And that includes our young ones. Day after day, they have to deal with pure pressure at

00:22:43.029 --> 00:22:51.549
school and its intense. Take her from Milan and Isaac. They share their stories in this

00:22:51.549 --> 00:23:06.190
episode of my teen life. I went to a vocational school where I was able to fast track learning

00:23:06.190 --> 00:23:11.549
a trade. Unexpectedly, I finished at the top of my class. After that, my teachers and

00:23:11.549 --> 00:23:16.549
my classmates started to expect a lot more from me. They were saying, you're doing so

00:23:16.549 --> 00:23:22.430
well. You represent the school. You will have to work hard. You'll do great things. You'll

00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:27.430
go far. They were constantly putting pressure on me to go for higher education and to go

00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:33.670
to university. There was this girl in high school who was my age. She was very friendly.

00:23:33.670 --> 00:23:40.269
She always paid attention to me. She was a nice person. I also thought she was cute. My

00:23:40.269 --> 00:23:48.190
classmates were like, go talk to her. Or, hey, Isaac, do you know that she likes you?

00:23:48.190 --> 00:23:53.950
And so I wasn't sure what to do. Of course, when I chose to go to that school, higher education

00:23:53.950 --> 00:23:58.950
wasn't the reason. I wanted to fast track getting a trade and then starting a job so that

00:23:58.950 --> 00:24:05.789
I could earn my income. That's what I thought. It was a really difficult time for me.

00:24:05.789 --> 00:24:13.349
I remember praying to Jehovah in tears for hours. I didn't ask for advice. Didn't talk

00:24:13.349 --> 00:24:20.190
to friends or people I trusted about it, not even my parents. And little by little, I

00:24:20.190 --> 00:24:25.869
started to give into that pressure that I got because of this girl. In the end, we started

00:24:25.869 --> 00:24:35.359
to flirt with each other. We chatted and sent each other messages. When I prayed to

00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:40.799
Jehovah, I didn't feel completely comfortable. I thought, if I'm not doing what Jehovah is

00:24:40.799 --> 00:24:46.039
asking of me, if I'm not behaving how Jehovah expects me to behave, then how can I expect

00:24:46.039 --> 00:24:51.480
him to listen to my prayers or even consider them? I family never told me to go or not to

00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:58.559
go to university, but they reminded me of Jehovah's thinking. My dad read Proverbs 27 verse 11

00:24:58.559 --> 00:25:04.920
to me. What I was doing was a barrier between me and Jehovah. He helped me see that the

00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:10.599
decisions I make as a teenager affect Jehovah. At that time, there were many videos, articles

00:25:10.599 --> 00:25:15.440
and publications about this topic, reading experiences of those who went through similar

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:21.319
things, doing personal study on the subject, and talking with spiritually mature brothers

00:25:21.319 --> 00:25:27.240
while in the ministry was very helpful for me. Something that my parents did that helped

00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:32.759
me a lot was that they used the book Young People Ask in our Family Study. And there's

00:25:32.759 --> 00:25:44.519
a chapter that talks about peer pressure. Afterward, I was able to cope. What helped me the

00:25:44.519 --> 00:25:49.640
most was something I heard at a circuit assembly. The speaker said in his talk, yes, our young

00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:55.480
people have a lot of challenges right now. And when it comes to higher education, maybe their

00:25:55.480 --> 00:26:00.200
classmates and teachers are pressuring them, but you young people, it felt like he spoke

00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:05.720
to me personally. Your teacher or classmate might not even be part of your life in the future,

00:26:06.279 --> 00:26:11.720
but if you want Jehovah always to be in your life, then you need to make your decisions accordingly.

00:26:14.970 --> 00:26:22.299
It was like a light went on in my head. Now I was sure about what I needed to do.

00:26:23.259 --> 00:26:32.299
I had to speak to her. One day I prayed to Jehovah and got up the courage. I told her that it couldn't

00:26:32.299 --> 00:26:39.579
continue with us. Of course, explaining that to my classmates and to my teachers was a little hard.

00:26:39.579 --> 00:26:45.660
I mean, it was difficult for them to understand. Sure, I explained it, but they said, why would you do

00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:54.779
that? For whoever is in the same situation that I was in, the best thing to do is to talk to someone

00:26:54.779 --> 00:27:08.519
you trust. Tell them how you feel and ask for help. Our creator, Jehovah, is the one who thinks

00:27:08.519 --> 00:27:17.160
about me and loves me most. He hasn't deprived me of anything good. He always helps us and never

00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:46.359
leaves us. I am so grateful to Jehovah. Delan and Isaac both admitted that the pressure they faced

00:27:47.079 --> 00:27:53.720
was almost too much, almost got the best of them. What helped them turn the corner?

00:27:54.279 --> 00:28:01.240
Isaac said it was reaching out and getting help. If you're facing similar pressures in school,

00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:08.680
don't keep it to yourself. Talk to someone you trust. That can open the door to getting just

00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:17.720
to help you need. Now we'd like to share something special with you. A recent discovery that has

00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:26.200
rewritten a part of our Theocratic history. Enjoy the following story more than 80 years in the making.

00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:36.039
Jehovah's Witnesses love the Bible. Long before taking on the monumental task of Bible translation,

00:28:36.039 --> 00:28:40.039
they acquired licenses to print already existing translations of the Bible.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:47.400
And then in the 1950s, the Watchtower Bible and Trek Society printed the first Bible ever to be

00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:53.640
translated by Jehovah's Witnesses, the New World translation of the Holy Scriptures. At least,

00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:58.519
we thought it was the first Bible ever to be translated by Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:28:58.519 --> 00:29:04.599
Well, in the fall of 2017, the World Headquarters Museum Department received a Bible donated by

00:29:04.599 --> 00:29:11.640
a brother in Germany. A company in the Bible was letter-referring to a rare Bible printed in

00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:19.319
1934 at MacBook, the location of the Watchtower Bible and Trek Society's Germany branch and printer

00:29:19.319 --> 00:29:24.680
at that time. Little was known about this Bible. And to those who didn't know of it, it was

00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:30.200
thought of as something unapproved by the then president of the Society, Jeve Rutherford.

00:29:30.839 --> 00:29:36.359
By 1934, Adolf Hitler's campaign against Jehovah's Witnesses was well underway.

00:29:37.319 --> 00:29:43.160
Our religious activities were banned, 65 tons of literature had been seized and burned

00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:48.839
by Nazi authorities, and the branch office and printer at MacBook had already been confiscated

00:29:48.839 --> 00:29:57.579
and released several times. And this may explain why the MacBook Bible doesn't have a typical

00:29:57.579 --> 00:30:03.500
publisher's page listing of who published it, who translated when and where it was printed.

00:30:04.299 --> 00:30:11.660
But on the bottom of one of the last pages, there is just one line in small letters and in

00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:21.420
reads printed, Watchtower Bible and Trek Society MacBook. Interestingly, on September 13, 1934,

00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:26.619
the Ministry of the Interior of the German Government granted permission for the MacBook Office

00:30:26.619 --> 00:30:35.660
to resume the printing and distribution of bubbles. However, everybody knew that the facilities

00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:41.099
could be shut down again, perhaps permanently at any time. What really could be accomplished

00:30:41.099 --> 00:30:46.539
in the limited time they had? The MacBook Office informed Rutherford that they had

00:30:46.539 --> 00:30:52.059
possession of a new testament manuscript ready for printing, and additionally a translation

00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:59.500
of the old testament was nearly complete. In October 1934, Rutherford approved the printing of

00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:07.180
100,000 copies, but time was running out. For the Rutherford received the following

00:31:07.180 --> 00:31:14.779
letter dated August 6, 1935, and it says, In the afternoon of July 10, a number of officials

00:31:14.779 --> 00:31:20.619
of the secret police of Berlin and MacBook appeared and sealed the factory, rooms and offices

00:31:20.619 --> 00:31:25.660
at MacBook, closed all factory rooms, attached the property and money of the society.

00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:29.900
Several thousand bubbles were just being bound and the rest is printed.

00:31:30.859 --> 00:31:35.579
Sadly, only a small number of those bubbles actually made it out of the printer.

00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:44.220
In November 2017, after a careful surge, we were able to obtain three copies of the MacBook

00:31:45.019 --> 00:31:51.500
Bible. Little did we know what a treasured place in our organization's history of Bible translation

00:31:51.980 --> 00:31:58.779
and printing this Bible deserves. It's not a mere compilation of existing translations,

00:31:58.779 --> 00:32:06.059
but a fresher, a unique translation of the Bible. Jehovah's name is used extensively in the

00:32:06.059 --> 00:32:10.539
text of the Hebrew scriptures, as well as in footnotes of the Christian Greek scriptures.

00:32:10.859 --> 00:32:16.940
The MacBook Bible was also cited in German language editions of the Watchtower,

00:32:17.819 --> 00:32:24.700
and nearly a century later, the text can still be easily understood by the German reader.

00:32:25.339 --> 00:32:30.779
This Bible translation truly has a remarkable story. Its print run was small

00:32:31.420 --> 00:32:35.019
by normal Bible printing standards and its distribution was even smaller,

00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:40.460
and although it was produced in record time and under highly dangerous circumstances,

00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:44.940
it storyily forgotten for decades until it was rediscovered.

00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:52.299
The MacBook Bible is the first non-bible to be translated and published by Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:32:52.299 --> 00:32:58.700
predating the new world translation of the Holy Scriptures. It was able to survive in a time

00:32:58.779 --> 00:33:03.660
of Nazi government opposition, and is now part of our Bible museum at Warwick.

00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:11.259
This Bible truly is a testimony to the words we find in Isaiah 40 verse 8,

00:33:12.619 --> 00:33:16.460
but Jehovah's Word bliped eviction.

00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:30.400
Not even the thread of Nazi oppression stopped our brothers in Germany from doing what they

00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:37.200
could to make the Bible more available. Why not? Because as Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:40.480
we love the Bible and love teaching others about it.

00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:45.680
But what does it take to be a good teacher of God's Word?

00:33:47.279 --> 00:33:50.799
In a morning worship program, Brother Jeffrey Jackson,

00:33:50.799 --> 00:33:56.640
discussed what we can learn from the Apostle Paul and how to reach the heart.

00:33:57.599 --> 00:34:03.759
How would you define a good teacher? That's an interesting question, isn't it?

00:34:04.559 --> 00:34:10.559
For many of us, perhaps we might answer by saying what we think a good speaker is like.

00:34:10.559 --> 00:34:17.760
We might say the brother uses many illustrations in his talk or he was able to highlight a

00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:22.800
scripture that I've read many times and yet for the first time I've seen something interesting

00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:29.920
in that that I've never seen before. Or perhaps we might say that he was able to keep my interest

00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:36.639
right through the 60 minutes. Well, there are all sorts of different ways we could say that

00:34:36.639 --> 00:34:43.199
someone is a good teacher. Of course, the best compliment someone could receive is if they're

00:34:43.199 --> 00:34:49.039
told that their teaching is similar to that of Jesus Christ because we know he said a wonderful

00:34:49.039 --> 00:34:55.199
example for all of us. But as we're thinking about the qualifications for someone to be a good

00:34:55.199 --> 00:35:02.159
teacher, let's turn our attention to the words of the Apostle Paul. And if you turn with me please

00:35:02.159 --> 00:35:10.639
to 1 Thessalonians chapter 2 and verses 7 and 8. And here we see in addition to some of the

00:35:10.639 --> 00:35:17.440
matters that we just discussed, other aspects or other qualities that I required for someone really

00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:27.519
to be an effective teacher. So as 1 Thessalonians 2, 7 and 8. On the contrary, we became gentle

00:35:27.519 --> 00:35:34.880
in your midst as when a nursing mother tenderly cares for her own children. So having tender affection

00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:43.199
for you, we were determined to impart to you not only the good news of God, but also our very

00:35:43.199 --> 00:35:50.320
selves. You notice some of the qualities or attributes here that the Apostle Paul mentions

00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:57.360
as being very important with regard to our teaching. In verse 8, it mentions tender affection.

00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:04.639
So love is very much connected with someone having the ability to be a good teacher.

00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:11.199
In fact, to reach the heart of the student, we have to display love as well, don't we?

00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:18.159
Without reaching the heart of the student, if we're trying to teach, it's like enjoying a meal

00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:26.320
in a dream. There really is no benefit at all. So if we teach but don't reach the heart of the

00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:33.920
student, then it really is a very little value to the student. Then looking on, notice it says Paul

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:42.719
was determined to impart not just the message of the good news, but his very self. In other words,

00:36:42.719 --> 00:36:51.119
he put his whole heart into teaching others. Let's look up at verse 7 and I feel quite confident

00:36:51.119 --> 00:36:56.719
in saying that probably none of us would have listed this quality as being essential for a good

00:36:56.719 --> 00:37:05.119
teacher. How does he start? We became gentle in your midst. Now, honestly, that probably isn't the

00:37:05.119 --> 00:37:11.280
first quality that would come to your mind with regard to a teacher. But what's meant by this

00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:18.400
expression to be gentle? Well, one Bible scholar made this comment. He said this word that's

00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:26.639
translated gentle was frequently used by Greek writers as characterizing a nurse with

00:37:26.639 --> 00:37:34.559
trying children or a teacher with refractory scholars. Now, I had to look up the word refractory

00:37:34.559 --> 00:37:42.719
and add it to my vocabulary. It means basically difficult to control, resisting authority,

00:37:42.719 --> 00:37:51.679
unmanageable, unresponsive. Well, do we see an interesting thought here? This gentleness

00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:59.920
has a firmness and stability about it that isn't rocked or shaken easily by the negative

00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:07.360
response of the one that's being taught. Isn't that an interesting quality? And no doubt, we've

00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:13.599
all tried to display that perhaps as we're trying to teach someone something about the scriptures

00:38:13.599 --> 00:38:21.119
and we come across the thought that this person doesn't really accept it. We state the fact,

00:38:21.119 --> 00:38:27.440
we show our scripture, but still they may have a problem. Well, how do we react? You see, if we

00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:34.719
were to demand that they accept what we say because we said it or because the scriptures said,

00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:42.559
without reasoning with that person, then really we don't have that gentleness that the apostle Paul

00:38:42.559 --> 00:38:50.639
is referring to here. So that's the ability under pressure to in a lovingly way, in loving way

00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:58.079
convince someone of something that perhaps they're not so responsive to. Doesn't that open

00:38:58.079 --> 00:39:05.039
our minds to another aspect of what is involved with good teaching? Now, by contrast, if we look

00:39:05.039 --> 00:39:12.159
back at 1 Thessalonians chapter 2, we'll see that the apostle Paul, in verses 5 and 6,

00:39:12.159 --> 00:39:17.440
gives us a contrast about the type of things that we wouldn't want to do as a teacher.

00:39:18.639 --> 00:39:26.400
Let's read that in verse 5 and 6. In fact, you know that we never use flattering speech

00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:35.119
or put on any false front with greedy motives. God is witness. Nor have we been seeking glory from

00:39:35.119 --> 00:39:41.679
men, either from you or from others, but we could be an expensive burden as apostles of Christ.

00:39:43.199 --> 00:39:48.480
So what are these negative things that we certainly would want to avoid if we want to be an

00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:55.280
effective teacher? We'll notice that first one, flattering speech. Now, this reminds us of another

00:39:55.280 --> 00:40:02.880
scripture. Let's turn across to Proverbs chapter 28 and verse 23. And this is a good reminder for all

00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:12.079
of us. It says, whoever reproves a man, you know, or corrects his thinking, will afterward find

00:40:12.079 --> 00:40:19.840
more favor, favor than someone who flatters with his tongue. Do we see the point that's being made there

00:40:20.079 --> 00:40:29.280
that flattery is not really an effective way for us to gain someone's confidence, but rather

00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:35.920
honestly correcting the thinking of someone else. So with our Bible students or whatever level of

00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:42.639
teaching that we're doing, we need to remember the part of the process of teaching involves

00:40:42.719 --> 00:40:50.239
giving counsel or direction and correcting wrong viewpoints. For us not to do that in a loving way

00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:56.719
really shows that we don't love the person properly because we don't really want them to change

00:40:56.719 --> 00:41:04.000
their wrong thinking. So avoiding flattering speech is very important. Going back to first of

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:11.840
us, this alone in chapter 2, what's the second point that Paul mentions? A false front with greedy

00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:21.199
motives. So a false front pretending to be someone that you're not. So none of us would ever want to

00:41:21.199 --> 00:41:28.559
put across a self-righteous viewpoint to try and convince others that we are holier than they are.

00:41:29.199 --> 00:41:35.679
But as it says here, not to have that false front. And then mentions greedy motives. You see

00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:41.599
there is a marginal reference that takes us across to Acts chapter 20 verse 33.

00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:48.400
There the Apostle Paul says, I have desired no man's silver or gold or clothing.

00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:58.079
So certainly as a teacher of the good news, we wouldn't want to expect some benefits or something

00:41:58.079 --> 00:42:04.639
that we've come back to us by means of our teaching. There the Apostle Paul sets a good standard

00:42:04.639 --> 00:42:13.280
for us. And then in verse 6, he said he wasn't seeking the glory of men or as one translation says

00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:22.480
insisting on our own dignity. So it could be that if we're a teacher, we may feel that we

00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:29.280
deserve a certain measure of respect. Yes, our position is a little higher than the student.

00:42:30.239 --> 00:42:37.280
Now if we really feel that way deep inside, that's going to affect as our attitude with regard to

00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:44.000
being gentle, aren't it? Because if someone questions what we say or if it looks like they're not

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:51.039
dignifying us in a proper manner, then we will lose that firm gentleness that helps correct

00:42:51.039 --> 00:42:57.280
the thinking of others. Well, when we think about all these various attributes and qualities that

00:42:57.280 --> 00:43:02.960
are needed for us to be a good teacher, perhaps we might feel that there's a lot we can work on.

00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:08.639
I'm sure I feel that way as well. It's a continual battle, isn't it for us to continue to try and

00:43:08.639 --> 00:43:15.840
be effective teachers? But one word of encouragement we gained from the book of Philippians as a final

00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:24.719
description. Philippians chapter 2 and verse 13, for God is the one who for the sake of his good

00:43:24.719 --> 00:43:33.599
pleasure energizes you, giving you both notice the desire. Yes, so the desire for us to impart the

00:43:33.599 --> 00:43:41.199
truth in a loving manner to others and then also the power to act. So as we consider our teaching

00:43:41.599 --> 00:43:49.280
abilities, don't just think of techniques, but always remember, when we're a good teacher we need to

00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:55.519
be gentle in the midst of others and help them in a loving way to correct wrong thoughts.

00:43:57.119 --> 00:44:04.719
Like Jesus, Paul put his whole heart into his teaching. His concern for others moved him to share

00:44:04.719 --> 00:44:13.039
the good news with as many as possible. In modern times, many have shown that same spirit, moving

00:44:13.039 --> 00:44:20.239
them to preach even in the face of opposition. One of those sisters is Maria Kalunianov.

00:44:22.599 --> 00:44:31.719
So my mother was born in the country of Bulgaria in 1922 and in the early 50s, my family emigrated

00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:38.280
from Germany to the United States. We settled in New York City and it was there that my mother

00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:47.239
learned the truth. That's the first time I opened a Bible. I ended up in Revelation chapter 21,

00:44:48.039 --> 00:44:55.400
but what hit me was the point that they will not be sickness, sorrow, and death.

00:44:56.360 --> 00:44:57.159
Anymore.

00:44:58.119 --> 00:45:02.840
Anyone that comes into the truth wants to share that with their family.

00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:11.480
I had the desire to tell them the truth how they can get free from

00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:21.400
oppression and sickness and death. So she very much saw the deed and desired to have literature

00:45:22.039 --> 00:45:29.239
in the Bulgarian language. She was able to ask the brothers in Brooklyn, specifically offering

00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:37.960
could she translate some literature in Bulgaria? The brothers approved her to do that, starting out

00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:45.389
with some of the tracks. So Bulgaria was behind the Iron Curtain, a communist country,

00:45:46.030 --> 00:45:51.469
literature about God and the Bible is not acceptable and banned.

00:45:52.429 --> 00:45:59.150
And so you can't just mail it. So as literature became available, people have to take it in.

00:46:00.269 --> 00:46:04.110
My family was one of those families that volunteered to do that.

00:46:05.230 --> 00:46:11.949
We traveled into Bulgaria by train. We have a lot of luggage because every time we will go to

00:46:11.949 --> 00:46:16.190
Bulgaria we stay two and a half months. That was the summer vacation.

00:46:17.550 --> 00:46:24.590
In that luggage in various places, we put literature.

00:46:25.869 --> 00:46:33.630
Traveling into a country with banned literature is not without its problems or dangers.

00:46:34.349 --> 00:46:38.349
They knew that we had some literature and that was the track.

00:46:38.989 --> 00:46:46.429
My mother realized that we were going to be searched. We had the ability then

00:46:47.150 --> 00:46:54.590
to take the literature out of each luggage that we had hidden it and to put it into one small

00:46:54.590 --> 00:47:03.630
briefcase. And what we couldn't as unfolded tracks, we put around our arm with our overcoats

00:47:04.590 --> 00:47:13.230
over it. I was only worried about how I can hide that literature so he cannot find it.

00:47:13.230 --> 00:47:18.030
Because if he will find it, then really there are consequences.

00:47:18.829 --> 00:47:23.550
So as the guards would search through the luggage, they rifle through it. They don't straighten

00:47:23.550 --> 00:47:29.949
anything out. So my mother quickly thought and asked them, can I now go over there and straighten

00:47:29.949 --> 00:47:40.590
out what you've messed up? And they said, okay. And I took my tracks which I had around my hand

00:47:41.230 --> 00:47:49.949
and I put it in the already checked bag over there. One of the guards gets to the point that it's

00:47:49.949 --> 00:47:59.630
my little briefcase. He says, this is so small, nothing could be in here and he just takes it

00:47:59.630 --> 00:48:09.000
over there. The man who was looking up was getting very nervous because he knew we had something

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:18.400
but he was not able to find it. So in one trip years later, my mother was on her own.

00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:27.280
The officials at the border of Bulgaria found the literature. They arrested her. They put her in

00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:37.920
prison. They interrogated her for two weeks or more every day. And in time, the Bulgarian government

00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:44.400
had changed their mind and had decided that as a foreign national, they would just expel her from

00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:52.940
the country. To this day, my mother continues her spiritual routine of worshiping Jehovah,

00:48:53.659 --> 00:48:59.739
being at the meetings, preparing for the meetings, reading her Bible, and zealously sharing

00:48:59.739 --> 00:49:11.500
the truth with others. It helps me practically every minute in my life. And I want to use my last

00:49:11.500 --> 00:49:25.099
energy to make his will know. Once Mr. Kalunianoff heard the Bible's message, she just had to share it

00:49:25.099 --> 00:49:31.739
with those in her home country. As she's gotten older, her circumstances have changed,

00:49:32.380 --> 00:49:40.219
but not her determination. She still wants to do whatever she can, using her last energy as she

00:49:40.219 --> 00:49:47.820
put it to make God's will known. Do you have faithful ones like Mr. Kalunianoff in your congregation?

00:49:48.219 --> 00:49:56.940
Keep them in mind as you enjoy this month's music video. It's called Two Small Coins.

00:52:36.199 --> 00:54:03.019
What a beautiful reassurance that no matter what our limitations may be, our gifts have great

00:54:03.019 --> 00:54:11.980
value in Jehovah's eyes. For this month's video postcard, let's travel to a land of incredible

00:54:11.980 --> 00:54:21.579
scenic beauty, New Zealand. New Zealand has made up primarily of two main islands, about 1,600

00:54:21.579 --> 00:54:30.059
kilometers or more than 1,000 miles southeast of Australia. On those islands, you'll find snow-capped

00:54:30.059 --> 00:54:38.539
mountain ranges, crystal clear lakes, miles of beaches, and a sweeping coastline with many

00:54:38.539 --> 00:54:46.940
harbours and fjords. It's also an area of dramatic geothermal activity, with active volcanoes,

00:54:47.820 --> 00:54:55.900
geysers, bubbling mud pools, and one of the largest hot springs in the world, the fittingly

00:54:55.980 --> 00:55:04.940
named frying pan lake. Residents of New Zealand are often nicknamed Kiwis, a nod to one of the

00:55:04.940 --> 00:55:13.260
country's most unique indigenous birds, the long-build and flightless Kiwi. The good news first

00:55:13.260 --> 00:55:19.980
reached New Zealand in the late 1890s, when one local reader of the watchtower publications

00:55:19.980 --> 00:55:27.579
started preaching on his own. A few years later, coal porters from Australia and the United States

00:55:27.579 --> 00:55:34.780
arrived, and the good news began to spread. The early witnesses in New Zealand were intrepid

00:55:34.780 --> 00:55:43.260
preachers, crossing rugged terrain on foot, horseback, and bicycle to reach remote towns.

00:55:43.980 --> 00:55:49.900
One New Zealander, who became a zealous preacher in those early days, was William Berry,

00:55:50.539 --> 00:55:57.260
who read the six volumes of studies in the scriptures in 1909, and immediately recognized he

00:55:57.260 --> 00:56:05.820
had found the truth. He diligently taught the truth to his children, and in 1975, his son Lloyd Berry

00:56:05.820 --> 00:56:12.619
became a member of the governing body. The truth is also spread quickly among the Maori,

00:56:12.619 --> 00:56:19.659
the indigenous people of New Zealand. The first Maori language convention was held in 1928.

00:56:20.380 --> 00:56:26.539
Today, we have many Maori brothers and sisters who enjoy sharing their rich culture with others.

00:56:28.219 --> 00:56:35.420
Altogether, there are more than 15,000 publishers in New Zealand, preaching in 18 different languages,

00:56:36.139 --> 00:56:43.340
including New Zealand Sign Language. Here on the south island is the seaside town of Picton,

00:56:44.380 --> 00:56:50.300
and home for the Picton congregation. With a busy waterfront and ferry terminal,

00:56:51.099 --> 00:56:57.900
Picton welcomes many tourist and international workers, so there are plenty of opportunities

00:56:57.900 --> 00:57:03.820
for public witnessing. To reach those living in homes around the many bays of Picton,

00:57:04.699 --> 00:57:11.820
the preaching work involves using boats owned by brothers. The 39 publishers and pioneers

00:57:11.820 --> 00:57:18.940
in the Picton congregation send their love and greetings. From the world headquarters of

00:57:18.940 --> 00:57:25.019
Jehovah's Witnesses, this is, he has this is J.W. Broadcasting.
