00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.779
We met at a party when I was in the military.

00:00:03.779 --> 00:00:08.699
I was on the dance floor, and I saw

00:00:08.699 --> 00:00:13.699
Frenchy, and I was like, oh, I'm gonna talk to this girl right here.

00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:18.239
The whole time we were just smiling at each other.

00:00:18.239 --> 00:00:21.239
This instant attraction, it was mutual.

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:25.239
Gradually, we were living together

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:30.239
and a few months go by and things are going well

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:33.240
and then I find out I'm pregnant.

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:37.740
And he left.

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:42.250
I was shocked though I shouldn't have been,

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.250
but I was shocked.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.250
And truthfully, I was scared like,

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.250
what am I gonna do now?

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.250
I felt like a failure,

00:00:53.250 --> 00:01:00.539
and I kept asking myself, how did I let this happen?

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.539
I knew that I had to be there, and I wanted to be there.

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.540
I just didn't know how.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.540
We prayed together for the first time

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.540
as a couple.

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.540
That was a Friday night.

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.540
Saturday morning, we had a knock on the door.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.540
We decided to have a Bible study.

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.540
They had to study the chapter on family life and marriage.

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:30.540
At that moment, I knew that I wanted to have our relationship

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.540
be honorable before Jehovah.

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.540
You learned that Jehovah meant for marriage

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.540
just to be a permanent bond.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.540
The insecurities of every disagreement,

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.540
ending in a breakup or divorce,

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.540
all of that went away.

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:55.540
We started to see Jehovah's training in practical ways.

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:00.540
Just learning how to be a husband

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.540
who respected and cared for his wife,

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.539
we became partners, a team, a compliment,

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:15.539
and that was only because Jehovah taught us how to do it.

00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:18.539
Though it was difficult at the outset,

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:23.539
we made that decision to dedicate our life to do Jehovah's will.

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:28.650
We got baptized together.

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.650
We've been married 25 years,

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.650
and the insecurities are gone.

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.650
I focus on all the blessings that have come,

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.650
just for keeping Jehovah in our life,

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:51.210
and that's the best feeling in the world.

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:54.210
You can go go at it on your own,

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:56.210
but you'll never find the joy,

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:58.210
you'll never find the peace,

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:02.210
you'll never find the security that comes from doing it Jehovah's way.
