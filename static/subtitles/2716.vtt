00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:15.369
My whole life I wanted to be a teacher, it was very gratifying, but yet there was something

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:19.329
that was empty in my life.

00:00:19.329 --> 00:00:24.250
I would see children that were disabled.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:29.690
Not because they had done anything wrong, they were just born that way, and I thought

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:35.409
to myself, that doesn't make sense to me.

00:00:35.409 --> 00:00:37.810
God is a God of love.

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:41.890
I know God could fix all these things.

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.009
Why hasn't He?

00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:52.570
And then it was a child in my school that successfully got me the answers to my questions.

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:59.009
She asked me the question, do you know I'm one of Jehovah's Witnesses?

00:00:59.009 --> 00:01:02.689
Would you like to know more about Jehovah's Witnesses?

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:07.689
And I thought to myself, I do, I really do.

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:13.569
Why don't you come over and visit me someday and tell me about Jehovah's Witnesses?

00:01:13.569 --> 00:01:20.170
When she came back the next week, I sat there and listened, and she taught me things.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:27.810
She taught me how to look into my own Bible, to find the answers to questions.

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:37.650
And all of this Sutton, I'm getting answer after answer after answer, which for 25 years

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.730
I couldn't find these answers anywhere, and it was amazing to me.
