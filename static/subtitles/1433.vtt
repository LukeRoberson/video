00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:07.879
In the central Europe branch territory, a special campaign was organized.

00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:11.880
Actually, the School for Branch Committee members triggered an evaluation

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:18.879
how much territory in the countries we oversee is not really covered thoroughly.

00:00:18.879 --> 00:00:24.879
So we asked our circuit overseers to recommend us which sections of the congregations

00:00:24.879 --> 00:00:29.879
territory could be listed as so-called unassigned territory.

00:00:29.879 --> 00:00:35.880
All in all, we received over 11,000 territories from the congregations

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.880
with approximately 3 million inhabitants.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.880
So because of this grand scale, there was suddenly the idea

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.880
why not organizing a special preaching campaign to cover all these territories

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.880
on one single weekend.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.880
This was really exciting.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.880
And after getting the branch committee's approval,

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.880
the service department started to organize it.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.880
To be honest, at first, we were not really sure how the publishers

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.879
would react to such a campaign.

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.879
But we fully trusted in Jehovah and the response was stunning.

00:01:08.879 --> 00:01:14.879
Over 20,000 publishers participated and were assigned to all these territories

00:01:14.879 --> 00:01:16.879
throughout Germany.

00:01:16.879 --> 00:01:22.879
The campaign took place on one weekend in May 2017 and was especially successful

00:01:22.879 --> 00:01:31.849
in metropolitan areas, as in Berlin, Hamburg or DÃ¼sseldorf.

00:01:32.849 --> 00:01:35.849
At one door, a man just arrived.

00:01:35.849 --> 00:01:39.849
He wanted to open his shop where he sells Arabian specialties.

00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:42.849
We were able to show him a video in Arabic.

00:01:42.849 --> 00:01:45.849
Then he gave us his address and phone number.

00:01:45.849 --> 00:01:48.849
He also agreed to have someone visit him again.

00:01:48.849 --> 00:01:52.849
Yes, it's really a privilege to join in such a campaign

00:01:52.849 --> 00:01:55.849
and to see that every human is precious to Jehovah,

00:01:55.849 --> 00:01:58.849
no matter where they live or where they come from.

00:01:58.849 --> 00:02:02.849
Because of the need and the fantastic response in 2017,

00:02:02.849 --> 00:02:07.849
it was decided to repeat such a campaign in May 2018.

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:13.849
And this time it was expanded to Switzerland, Austria, Luxembourg and Lichtenstein.

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:19.849
And now imagine, over 32,000 publishers participated,

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:24.849
which is actually over 60% more than in May 2017.

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:28.849
This was really faith strengthening and again,

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:32.849
a lot of wonderful experiences very potted.

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:34.849
It's incredible.

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:38.849
No matter where you are in Berlin, you can see small groups of brothers everywhere.

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:40.849
That was really great.

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:44.849
In the ministry, we met a woman and she told us that she had just prayed for a Bible study.

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:51.849
We are now more than ever convinced that Jehovah leads all this work through his angels.

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:54.849
Today Sunday, we had a nice experience.

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:56.849
A woman called us from behind.

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:59.849
She had actually already passed us,

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:03.849
but she had a feeling she had to go back again. She told us later.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.800
After she had invited us to her home,

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.800
we exchanged our contact information

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.800
and could also fill in their online contact form.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.800
Had we been in the territory just one minute later,

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.800
we would never have made the contact.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.800
This must have been guided by the angels.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.800
Yesterday morning, while in the ministry,

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.800
a young man ran after us and asked us what we were doing.

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.800
We explained it to him.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.800
He asked us why there is still so much evil in the world then.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.800
In the afternoon, we were able to call on him again.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.800
We could start a Bible study right away

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.800
and arrange a return visit which we will make today.

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.800
Being together with friends is just so great.

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.800
You are out and about with a large group.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.800
You meet up again regularly to change partners

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.800
and to relate experiences.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.800
It's just great.

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.800
Thousands of videos were shown

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.800
and a lot of Bible studies were started.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.800
And what is very interesting,

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.800
a lot of publishers felt motivated

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.800
to expand the ministry after the campaign.

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.800
For sure, these preaching campaigns

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.800
truly prove that Jehovah and Jesus

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.800
are directing the preaching work

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.800
and the angels are helping us

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.800
in reaching out to all people.

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.800
We really have a lot of reasons

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.800
to be Jehovah's happy people.
