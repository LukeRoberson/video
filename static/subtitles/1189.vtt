00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:09.500
Every year we organize more than 150 regional conventions in our branch territory.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.859
Some convention locations are 50 kilometres or more away from the local congregations

00:00:14.859 --> 00:00:17.899
and the families are poor.

00:00:17.899 --> 00:00:24.649
Sometimes families have to work for two or more days to reach the convention location.

00:00:24.649 --> 00:00:29.809
Generally, the Convention Committee will request local elders to ask families who live

00:00:29.809 --> 00:00:34.850
in the town where the Convention is organized if they can accommodate brothers and sisters

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.609
coming for the Convention.

00:00:37.609 --> 00:00:42.289
But the problem is that these families are poor too.

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:51.020
Even in that poverty, they are willing to give everything they have.

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.619
I host brothers who come for the Convention.

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:59.380
I will sell one of my pigs or chickens and with that money, we can all have something

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:01.299
to eat.

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:03.979
I know Jehovah is a generous God.

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:11.609
I also want to show that love for those who draw close to Him.

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:16.609
The Book of Philippians chapter 4 verses 12 and 13 teaches me not only to focus on my

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:21.810
own needs but also on the needs of my brothers.

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.489
I take in guests so they can hear Jehovah's teaching.

00:01:25.489 --> 00:01:28.129
This gives me a lot of joy.

00:01:28.129 --> 00:01:32.530
The spiritual food that Jehovah provides for us is helpful in this life and in the life

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.689
we live in the future.

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:40.620
That's why I consider it more important than physical food.

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:45.060
In reality, hospitality is not about our material possessions.

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.859
It's about the heart.
