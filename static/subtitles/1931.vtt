00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:06.799
How heartwarming it's been to see millions take their stand for true worship.

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.320
Thousands more are joining us every week.

00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:16.480
Jehovah is speeding up the in-gathering work, and this makes us very happy.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:24.480
But who will work to provide the Bible's, Bible literature, and the audio and video publications

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.079
that sustain us spiritually and help us to accomplish our kingdom preaching and teaching work?

00:00:30.559 --> 00:00:39.119
Bethel is a unique place. It's where mature Christians render sacred service to Jehovah

00:00:39.119 --> 00:00:45.280
in close association with Christ's brothers. They minister to the needs of our worldwide

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:53.119
brotherhood and support the preaching work. The Bethel family is a group of dedicated,

00:00:53.119 --> 00:01:00.960
baptized servants of Jehovah who live and work together closely. So they experience in a special

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:11.680
way what Psalm 133 1 says. Look how good and how pleasant it is for brothers to dwell together in

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:18.640
unity. We're very pleased to see that many have expanded their service to Jehovah by making

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:25.680
themselves available for the special privilege of Bethel's service. Have you considered this

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:33.549
as a goal? Making yourself available for Bethel's service is like knocking on a door that leads to

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:41.469
many other privileges of service. Of course, to serve at Bethel requires a self-sacrificing spirit,

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:46.590
and a willingness to serve wherever there is a need in harmony with the attitude displayed by the

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:53.069
prophet Isaiah in Isaiah 6.8. Then I heard the voice of Jehovah saying,

00:01:53.870 --> 00:02:00.750
whom shall I send? And who will go for us? And I said, here I am, send me.

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:09.150
When Isaiah learned about an opportunity to do more in Jehovah's service, he responded eagerly,

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:14.189
even though he did not know exactly what he was going to be assigned to do. It was enough

00:02:14.189 --> 00:02:20.909
for him to know that Jehovah was extending an invitation to serve in a special way. And Isaiah

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:27.310
wanted to volunteer. The same spirit is shown by Bethel family members worldwide.

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:35.870
What especially motivates so many to serve at Bethel? Love for Jehovah moves us to put Kingdom

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:44.509
ahead of self-interest, as stated in the Proclaimers book page 295. This is not work in which they gain

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:50.509
personal prominence or material possessions. Their desire is to honor Jehovah, and they are

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:56.509
satisfied with the provisions made for them in the way of food, lodging, and a modest allowance

00:02:56.509 --> 00:03:04.590
for personal expenses. Are there any rewards that come from serving in this unique way? Those who

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:11.949
have offered themselves willingly for Bethel service have truly been blessed. The love and

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:18.349
unity we feel here is incomparable. It's not like in a company out in the world, because here you

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:27.009
can work with your friends every day. Like-minded people have the same goals and support each other.

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:33.090
That is what you can feel here. Maybe you're assigned a task that you've never performed before,

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:38.530
but there are many experienced brothers and sisters who can help professionally as well as

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:44.610
personally. Whether it's the consideration of the daily text or watched our study with the

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:49.650
Bethel family, listening to the practical, valuable comments of our brothers and sisters

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:54.849
is really refreshing. You really feel that they love Jehovah and their comments help you to feel

00:03:54.849 --> 00:04:03.219
the same. Here in Bethel you have the best employer that there is. Jehovah, no other employer is

00:04:03.219 --> 00:04:08.659
as grateful and considerate as he is. So out of love for Jehovah, you're simply happy to give

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:15.300
him your best. Whenever I think about what has been done at Bethel, publications are being produced

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:20.819
and shipped. Videos for our conventions are being made, and there is translation being done

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:28.339
into so many different languages. I keep getting goosebumps. No matter what I can do here, knowing that

00:04:28.579 --> 00:04:33.060
by doing it and supporting Christ's brothers makes me feel very, very good.

00:04:34.579 --> 00:04:43.220
So how does a young person qualify for Bethel service? My parents raised me to have a spiritual

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:50.500
focus. So in the school holidays or as growing up, our life revolved around the ministry, doing

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:57.860
spiritual activities and it really helped us keep focus spiritually as a family and helped me

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:05.459
stay focused on the goals that we wanted to achieve. I really enjoy reading, and one day my dad

00:05:05.459 --> 00:05:10.259
just said to me, why don't you read the Bible? I know it sounds obvious, but at that point I'd never

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:18.740
read it from Genesis to Revelation. So when I finish reading the Bible, it really changed my thinking

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:27.860
and it really proved the truth to myself, and this helped me to keep a spiritual focus,

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:34.819
and it really was the first step in reaching out and achieving the spiritual goals that I wanted

00:05:34.819 --> 00:05:40.019
to achieve. In the congregation I was able to help out with doing the magazines and the sound

00:05:40.019 --> 00:05:47.860
and the platform, and doing these privileges really helped me to build a good work ethic and

00:05:48.019 --> 00:05:53.379
given ways that I could give more to Jehovah. So the elders used to work with me a lot on the

00:05:53.379 --> 00:06:00.259
ministry, so when I'd get to feeling like, I can't do this or this is too much, it's too overwhelming

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:06.740
or I'd never be able to reach this goal. And elders showed me a scripture, the Bible where

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:14.660
Jehovah was encouraging Joshua to be courageous, and that really impacted me that I was able to

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:23.620
be courageous too, to reach my goal of Bethel. So when I visited Bethel, I saw that there were

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:32.100
no more people, and they had so many good qualities that I wanted to imitate, very hospitable,

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:39.699
very warm, very inviting, that helped me to want to reach my goal so I could be like that.

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:47.459
To serve at Bethel, there are qualifications that need to be met. You should have a deep love for

00:06:47.459 --> 00:06:53.379
Jehovah and the organization, which is demonstrated by living in harmony with Bible standards.

00:06:54.019 --> 00:07:01.139
You must have a fine reputation as a spiritual person. You should have respect for Jehovah's moral

00:07:01.139 --> 00:07:07.699
standards, avoiding uncleanness and sexual immorality. You should have a clean conscience before

00:07:07.699 --> 00:07:14.980
Jehovah and be at peace with yourself and with Jehovah's organization. Your dressing grooming

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:19.939
should be exemplary, befitting a Christian minister, even during leisure time,

00:07:20.819 --> 00:07:27.860
styles that are fattish or extreme, or that identify us with undesirable elements of the world

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:36.420
are not acceptable at Bethel. The applicant would not read, listen to, or view any type of material

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:43.220
that is inappropriate for a Christian. Such unhost some material certainly would include pornography,

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:49.139
debasing music, or any kind of entertainment that features sexual immorality,

00:07:49.139 --> 00:07:56.899
spiritism, or violence. Bethel applicants should be from 18 to 35 years of age.

00:07:57.699 --> 00:08:03.459
Occasionally, there is an opening for someone over 35 years of age who may have specialized

00:08:03.459 --> 00:08:09.620
skills that are needed at Bethel, such as those with certain technical or medical experience,

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:17.300
translation skills, or building trades such as plumbing, electrical, heavy equipment mechanic,

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:22.660
or carpentry. Those with such capabilities and training are welcome to apply.

00:08:24.259 --> 00:08:28.500
In view of the unique demands of a full-time assignment at Bethel,

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:35.139
you should be mentally and emotionally sound, physically strong, and able to work long hours.

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:41.700
You should be able to read, write, and speak the primary language of the branch territory.

00:08:42.419 --> 00:08:48.179
This will enable you to communicate well with others serving at Bethel to receive needed training

00:08:48.179 --> 00:08:55.460
and to work safely in the Bethel environment. Bethel applicants agree to serve for a minimum of one

00:08:55.460 --> 00:09:00.580
year. During which time you will receive training for continued Bethel service.

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:09.059
With regard to secular skills, we do not encourage individuals to obtain university education or

00:09:09.059 --> 00:09:13.700
training with the thought that this will improve their chances of being called into Bethel.

00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:20.740
The best way to prepare for Bethel service is to first serve in the full-time pioneer ministry.

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:27.620
The greatest need is for single brothers. However, all who meet the qualifications,

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:32.100
including sisters, are encouraged to apply for temporary volunteer service.

00:09:33.059 --> 00:09:37.539
Serving as a temporary volunteer at Bethel may open the way to other opportunities

00:09:37.539 --> 00:09:43.539
to expand your service to Jehovah. If you are interested in applying for Bethel service,

00:09:43.539 --> 00:09:47.379
you should make your desire known to your congregation service committee,

00:09:47.379 --> 00:09:54.179
who will provide you access to the online applications by means of my.jw.org.

00:09:54.740 --> 00:10:00.340
However, which application should you complete? Since there are two types of applications

00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:06.259
available, first give careful and prayerful consideration to your circumstances.

00:10:06.259 --> 00:10:12.179
Thereafter, decide whether you will complete the application for volunteer program A19,

00:10:12.179 --> 00:10:16.419
which is available for those interested in serving on a temporary basis,

00:10:16.419 --> 00:10:20.500
for as brief as one week or as long as several consecutive months.

00:10:21.299 --> 00:10:26.500
Or you may decide to complete the application to become a member of the worldwide order

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:33.059
of special full-time servants of Jehovah's Witnesses A8. This application is for those

00:10:33.059 --> 00:10:38.019
interested in serving on a long-term basis for one full year or longer.

00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:43.220
If the branch committee determines that there is a need for your services,

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:48.259
they will decide where you can best be used, whether it Bethel or perhaps on the

00:10:48.259 --> 00:10:54.019
Theocratic Construction Assignment. Submitting your application may open a door of

00:10:54.019 --> 00:10:59.059
opportunity to serve Jehovah and his organization in a variety of ways.

00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:09.820
Of course, not all of us who have such a self-sacrificing spirit have the circumstances in life

00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:18.700
to serve at Bethel, but we can encourage others who do. Parents follow the example of God-fearing

00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:26.139
parents such as Hannah and Alcena, who willingly made their son available for expanded

00:11:26.139 --> 00:11:32.379
theocratic privileges. Continue to place the goal of Bethel's service before your young ones

00:11:33.259 --> 00:11:39.259
and stimulate their interest in the full-time ministry by your example and your positive

00:11:39.259 --> 00:11:46.700
expressions. If possible, bring them on a tour of World Headquarters in New York, USA,

00:11:47.419 --> 00:11:54.139
or make arrangements to bring them on a tour of the Bethel in the branch territory in which you live.

00:11:55.259 --> 00:12:01.259
Such visits can help young ones to witness firsthand the work that's being done at Bethel

00:12:01.259 --> 00:12:08.220
to promote Kingdom interest. Elders, help young ones in your congregations who have the

00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:15.820
potential to expand their service to Jehovah to meet the qualifications. Jehovah continues to

00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:23.580
look for those willing to respond to his invitation to expand their service to him. As in Isaiah's

00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:32.059
day, he asks, whom shall I send and who will go for us? Will you answer as did the prophet,

00:12:32.059 --> 00:12:39.899
here I am, send me. We encourage you to progress to spiritual maturity and serve Jehovah whole

00:12:39.899 --> 00:12:47.659
soul. In due time, you may qualify to serve at Bethel or in another form of exciting theocratic

00:12:47.659 --> 00:12:54.059
service that permits you to use the health and strength that Jehovah's granted you in an expanded

00:12:54.059 --> 00:13:03.580
way all to his praise. Please be assured that we love you for the willing spirit you show as

00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:13.100
you continue to reach out in Jehovah's service.
