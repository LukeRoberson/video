00:00:01.139 --> 00:00:13.339
What mattered most to me was that everything was just right.

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:20.339
My apartment had to be spotless and the dining table had to be full with different types of food, completely full.

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:28.339
I was worried that our apartment wasn't big enough to accommodate guests, not even for a meal.

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:35.340
I was often wondering if we would have enough time for invitations or if it would be too stressful.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.340
Before my financial situation was much better, currently it's not good, but I manage.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:48.340
The brothers and sisters are such a precious gift from Jehovah. This is truly the family he gave us.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:54.340
The brothers and sisters have shown us so much love and I want to do all I can to express my gratitude.

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.340
The best way to do so is just by spending time together.

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.340
We're happy to take time for our brothers.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:07.340
There's so many of the friends live alone or just want someone to spend time with.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:13.340
It's nice when we can show hospitality in our homes, but I've learned that hospitality starts in the Kingdom Hall.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:19.340
After all, Jehovah has invited all of us to be his guests. I prefer to stand right by the entrance.

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:25.340
This way I can notice any interested ones that come to the meetings, a warm smile shows personal interest,

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.340
and lets them know I'm genuinely happy that they've come.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:36.340
The sisters and sisters in the congregation are my family. That is why I want to hug them, kiss them, ask them how they feel.

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.340
They should feel happy just as I am.

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:47.340
I am normally pretty tired after the meeting. I've had a long day and still have the rest of the week ahead of me.

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.340
But that is the case with the others too. Sometimes there are things they would like to share.

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.340
Taking the time to listen to them can really make their day.

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:04.340
I plan to invite four to five friends every other week. To my great joy, my plan came true within a year and a half.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.340
Everyone was invited and everyone came.

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.340
Brothers usually ask me what to bring. I say, don't bring anything. Just your beautiful smile.

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.340
And bring someone who you know very well, but who I don't know.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:23.340
There have been times after the meeting when we've said to each other, we just have to invite someone over.

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:29.340
Then we go around asking people sometimes for or more until we find someone who has time.

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:36.340
This has led to so many beautiful moments together. No one feels pressured or expects anything extravagant.

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:42.449
Everyone is relaxed and it feels like a calm evening with family.

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:46.449
One experience completely changed my view of hospitality.

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:54.449
A friend of mine called me and said, hey, I'm close by. Do you have time? Can I come over?

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:59.449
I thought, what am I supposed to cook? At that moment, the doorbell ring.

00:02:59.449 --> 00:03:06.449
My friend was already there. The only thing I could think of to cook was pasta with sauce.

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:15.449
When we sat down to eat, my friend said to me, Stephanie, pasta is my favorite food. There was a great moment.

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:19.449
I live a simple life. To host brothers, I need to spend some money.

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:25.449
However, there are leaflets with special offers. I check them to see what's discounted.

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:30.819
The friends are happy and I didn't spend a lot of money.

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:38.819
We've had several brothers spend an idea. They come for pioneer school, elder school and other theocratic projects.

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:46.819
It's so encouraging to see their positive attitude when they come home in the evenings. It's priceless.

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:53.819
They're energized from the school and they have so many upbuilding thoughts. Their positivity is contagious.

00:03:53.819 --> 00:04:00.580
Our apartment isn't very big, so we wondered where our guests could sleep.

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.580
We decided to turn the office into a guest room.

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:12.580
We had to move the desk into our room, but now we have space for an air mattress for our guests to sleep on.

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:14.580
It's a great solution.

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:18.579
I take photos of my guests and stick them into my photo album.

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:23.579
We live in such times when it's normal to get said sometimes. It happens to me too.

00:04:23.579 --> 00:04:28.579
My remedy for sadness is to take the photos, look at them. Remember our get-togethers.

00:04:28.579 --> 00:04:33.579
Remember our laughter. Remember the atmosphere we had, the experiences I heard.

00:04:33.579 --> 00:04:36.579
I meditate on them and that lifts me up again.

00:04:36.579 --> 00:04:40.579
When I see how happy my guests are, it makes me truly happy.

00:04:40.579 --> 00:04:47.579
Spending time together not only strengthens our friendships with each other, but also with Jehovah as well.

00:04:47.579 --> 00:04:53.579
We live in such insecure times. We really don't know what life situations we will face next.

00:04:53.579 --> 00:04:57.579
Not only are we affected by these situations, but others are also.

00:04:57.579 --> 00:05:04.579
Making the best out of the time we have together helps to build friendships strong and meaningful friendships.

00:05:04.579 --> 00:05:13.579
There are so many different personalities in the congregation and the time is coming when it will be essential for us to stick together.

00:05:13.579 --> 00:05:18.579
We will face more and more pressure in this system of things.

00:05:18.579 --> 00:05:27.579
But we will be ever more thankful for the friendships and the congregation that can help us to resist this pressure.

00:05:27.579 --> 00:05:33.579
Together we are stronger because we can all support and rely on each other.

00:05:33.579 --> 00:05:36.579
Thank you very much.
