00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.919
An introduction to the book of Zechariah.

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:13.519
Zechariah began to prophesy in Jerusalem in 520 BCE,

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:18.620
17 years after the return from Babylonian exile.

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:21.519
He prophesied for at least two years,

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:27.320
completing the book, bearing his name in 518 BCE.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.719
His work overlapped that of the prophet Haggai.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.920
The rebuilding of Jehovah's Temple was at a standstill.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:41.020
It appeared to observers that Jehovah had forsaken the city.

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:46.820
The people there were discouraged and focused on personal comforts.

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.520
Jehovah sent Zechariah to join the prophet Haggai

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:59.020
and encouraging the Jews to resume the temple construction despite all obstacles.

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:00.719
Did you know?

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.519
Solomon's Temple was completed in just over seven years.

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.019
In contrast, when Zechariah wrote his book,

00:01:09.019 --> 00:01:18.040
the reconstruction had been underway for about 20 years, but without completion.

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.739
The book of Zechariah contains 14 chapters.

00:01:22.739 --> 00:01:27.439
Chapters 1-6 set forth a series of intriguing visions

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:31.439
that ensured divine backing of the work of rebuilding the temple

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.540
and the return to pure worship.

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.239
For example, one vision features a woman named Wickedness

00:01:39.239 --> 00:01:44.840
who is put into a container and taken far away by two winged women.

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:51.140
This illustrates that Wickedness has no place among Jehovah's people.

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:56.340
Chapters 7-8 urge God's people to turn from unjust treatment of the poor

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.840
and to deal with one another in loyal love and mercy.

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:08.240
Chapter 10-4 tells Jehovah's turning his favorable attention to his repentant people.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:14.240
Zechariah also recorded several significant prophecies about the Christ.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:20.939
He indicated that the future King of God's kingdom would triumphantly enter Jerusalem on a donkey.

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:27.740
Zechariah foretold God's true shepherd would be betrayed for 30 pieces of silver.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.939
Zechariah also foretold details about this Messianic Shepherd's death.

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:39.340
Chapter 14 states that Jehovah forms a very great valley.

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.639
This valley is for the protection of his people

00:02:42.639 --> 00:02:49.189
and results in a complete triumph of true worship.

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:51.689
As you study the book of Zechariah,

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:56.490
notice how Jehovah makes his work succeed despite adversity,

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:59.990
how he describes the future King of his kingdom

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:04.889
and how his loyal subjects will remain safe in his valley of protection.
