00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:05.750
This level of design makes the best use of donated funds.

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:09.750
While experts vary on the exact percentages,

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.750
over the lifetime of a typical building,

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:19.750
operational and maintenance costs can be four to six times the initial construction costs.

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.750
So the more efficient the design and construction,

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.750
the more long-term savings are realized for the organization.

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.750
For instance, an independent energy consultant recently calculated

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:36.750
that we could expect to see savings of over $1 million annually

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.750
from the energy efficiency measures incorporated into our project

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.750
as compared to a standard construction of similar facilities.

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:52.750
But you may be curious as to what energy and environmental features

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:59.750
were incorporated into the Warwick project to earn these awards and save funds.

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.750
These features covered multiple aspects of design.

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.750
They basically fall into five categories,

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:13.750
landscaping, rainwater control, lighting control,

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.750
energy efficiency, and water usage.

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.750
With respect to the first category, landscaping,

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.750
a control system checks rainfall and local weather conditions

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.750
to determine how much water is needed in each irrigation zone.

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:37.750
And drought-resistant native plants and trees also reduce water needs.

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.750
The second category is rainwater control.

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.750
All rainwater from the roof and building surfaces

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.349
is treated with green roofs,

00:01:50.349 --> 00:01:58.969
buyer retention areas, permeable concrete paving,

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:06.409
underground sand filters, and stormwater plantages.

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:10.409
Yet a third category is lighting control.

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:16.409
Lighting sensors in perimeter window spaces are linked to a control system

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:20.409
that balance natural lighting with fluorescent lighting

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:24.409
while still permitting the occupant control as desired.

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:28.409
The fourth category is energy efficiency.

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:37.259
High efficiency HVAC equipment, boilers, and chillers were incorporated.

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:42.259
A geothermal well-feel consisting of some 120 wells

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:49.259
takes advantage of renewable energy to supplement building heating and cooling needs.

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:54.259
And with respect to our fifth category, water usage,

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:59.259
water is conserved in all the buildings by means of plumbing fixtures

00:02:59.259 --> 00:03:02.259
that use lower volumes of water.

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:07.259
As we stated earlier, the operation and maintenance expense

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:12.259
is the greatest part of a building's total cost.

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:17.259
To the extent that we practice water, lighting, and energy conservation

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:20.259
in our individual rooms and workplaces,

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:24.259
to that extent, we can have a personal share

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:28.259
in realizing the full benefit, potential, and purpose

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:32.259
of these new facilities at Wacul & Worry.
