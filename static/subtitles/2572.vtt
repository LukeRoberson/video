00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:14.460
My mom's always on it me about trying to make healthy choices when it comes to food

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:17.460
because of my little weakness.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.460
I really like junk food.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.460
So my diet, I usually break my diet.

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.460
Like I'm sitting around in a watching a movie or something

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:33.460
and you open a bag of chips and it kind of depends on how close the chips are to you.

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.460
But you just keep going and then you get to like the crummy chips at the bottom

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.299
and then you realize you're beating the whole thing.

00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:47.299
I think that young people don't take care of their health

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:51.299
because health is only something to worry about when you're old.

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:56.299
A lot of young people think that you only have to worry about health care after you get sick.

00:00:56.299 --> 00:01:00.299
You know, like if you're still young, you better live it up.

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:02.299
Eat what you want, do what you want.

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:09.299
People might hate each, I think it's more important to think of how the food that they're going to eat

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.299
is going to affect their body and whether it's going to be

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:17.299
have a beneficial effect or whether it's just absolutely rubbish

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:19.299
that they're putting into their body.

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:23.299
Though you may not be seeing too many bad effects now,

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:28.299
later in life, you might not be able to do as many things you want to.

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.299
First Timothy, four of his eight says that bodily training is beneficial.

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:40.299
What I think that scripture means is that it's to have been intended for us to be healthy.

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:45.299
What it means to me is really just keeping in shape,

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.299
not of indulging.

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:52.299
Because if we are healthy, we can get the full enjoyment out of luck.

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:56.299
We can, you know, do much more if we are in a healthy state.

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:00.299
After work, often I go for a run and it helps me to calm down,

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.299
relieve the stress of the day's work.

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:07.299
It comes to exercise, you know, we live at the coast,

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:11.300
so it's really nice to make use of outdoors.

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.300
I like swimming.

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.300
I like records boards also, squashes.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.300
You can have good health.

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.300
You can do it.

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.300
It's a matter of having a routine and goals.
