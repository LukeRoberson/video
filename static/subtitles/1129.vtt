00:00:02.259 --> 00:00:07.259
Since the beginning of Christianity, Christians have been persecuted.

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:13.259
Please locate with me 2 Corinthians chapter 11.

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:24.260
Paul experienced the persecution and referred to it in 2 Corinthians chapter 11 verses 23 to 25.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.260
And it says,

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.260
Are they ministers of Christ?

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
I reply like a madman.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.259
I am more outstandingly one.

00:00:33.259 --> 00:00:41.259
I've done more work, been imprisoned more often, suffered countless beatings and experienced many near deaths.

00:00:41.259 --> 00:00:47.259
Five times I received 40 strokes less one from the Jews.

00:00:47.259 --> 00:00:49.259
Three times I was beaten with rods.

00:00:49.259 --> 00:00:53.259
Once I was stoned, three times I experienced shipwreck.

00:00:53.259 --> 00:00:56.259
A night in the day I've spent in the open sea.

00:00:56.259 --> 00:01:07.019
Shortly after recounting his many difficulties in chapter 12 verse 10, Paul wrote,

00:01:07.019 --> 00:01:17.019
So I take pleasure in weaknesses, in insults, in times of needs, in persecutions and difficulties for Christ.

00:01:17.019 --> 00:01:22.329
For when I'm weak, I am powerful.

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:26.329
Of course, Paul took no pleasure in persecution itself.

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:35.329
But he rejoiced because of what can result from it, contributing to Jehovah's vindication.

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:43.329
Find the Philippians chapter 114 and then verse 18.

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:50.329
Persecution gives us also an opportunity to see Jehovah act in behalf of his people

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:53.329
and magnify his name.

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:56.329
It can lead to a fine witness.

00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:05.079
In Philippians 1 verse 14 and 18, Paul wrote,

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:11.080
Now most of the brothers in the Lord have gained confidence because of my prison bonds

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:18.080
and they are showing all the more courage to speak the word of God fearlessly.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:25.080
And verse 18, with what result, only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth,

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.080
Christ is being proclaimed and I rejoice over this.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.080
In fact, I will also keep on rejoicing.

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:39.520
Instead of weakening our relationship with Jehovah and our hope,

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.520
persecution can strengthen it.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:50.520
In the discussion recorded at Romans chapter 5, 3 and 4, Paul explains,

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.520
Let us exalt while intribulations.

00:02:54.520 --> 00:03:02.520
Endurance leads to an approved condition, the approved condition in turn to hope

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.520
and hope does not lead to disappointment.

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:13.520
There is no doubt that hope helps us mightily to endure persecution.

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.520
The Bible uses the word hope in different contexts.

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:24.520
It speaks of the hope of salvation, which can refer to spiritual salvation.

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.520
There is hope of surviving Armageddon.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:33.520
There is hope of everlasting life on the paradise earth.

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.520
There is hope of immortality in heaven.

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:46.520
What hope was he talking about in Romans chapter 5, 3 and 4, about the heavenly hope?

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.520
Look at the context.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:53.520
Romans 5, 2, and the second part of the verse says,

00:03:53.520 --> 00:04:00.520
Let us rejoice based on the hope of the glory of God.

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:04.520
All Christians in the first century had the heavenly hope.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:09.520
Their hope was not just that problems or well-conditions would be resolved

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.520
or that they would get healed from some sickness.

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:15.520
Their hope was the heavenly hope.

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:21.519
Colossians 1, 3 says, We always thank God when we pray for you

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:28.519
because of the hope that is being reserved for you in the heavens.

00:04:28.519 --> 00:04:35.519
Now please turn to Romans chapter 8, verse 20 and 21.

00:04:35.519 --> 00:04:45.519
The great crowd of Jehovah's Witnesses today hope that Jehovah will reward them in an earthly paradise.

00:04:45.519 --> 00:04:54.519
Paul pointed to that hope when he wrote in Romans chapter 8, verse 20 and 21.

00:04:56.769 --> 00:05:01.769
For the creation was subjected to futility, not by its own will,

00:05:01.769 --> 00:05:06.769
but through the one who subjected it on the basis of hope,

00:05:06.769 --> 00:05:13.769
that the creation itself will be also set free from enslavement to corruption

00:05:13.769 --> 00:05:20.209
and have the glorious freedom of the children of God.

00:05:20.209 --> 00:05:25.209
However, when Paul said in Romans chapter 12, verse 12,

00:05:25.209 --> 00:05:28.209
rejoice in the hope ahead.

00:05:28.209 --> 00:05:31.209
He meant the heavenly hope.

00:05:31.209 --> 00:05:36.209
But the other sheep also can rejoice in the hope that's ahead of them.

00:05:36.209 --> 00:05:41.209
So then we can all rejoice triumphantly.

00:05:41.209 --> 00:05:45.209
The world's hope is dark, your hope is bright,

00:05:45.209 --> 00:05:50.209
the world's hope is collapsing, your hope nearest fulfillment,

00:05:50.209 --> 00:05:57.209
the world's hope is based on credulity, your hope is based on faith,

00:05:57.209 --> 00:06:03.209
the world's hope leads to disappointment, your hope leads to success.

00:06:03.209 --> 00:06:07.209
For with the new world, so very near, our fondest hopes,

00:06:07.209 --> 00:06:14.209
whether heavenly or earthly, will soon be realized to our eternal satisfaction.

00:06:14.209 --> 00:06:19.209
Let's read together Titus chapter 2, verse 13,

00:06:19.209 --> 00:06:32.600
while we wait for the happy hope and glorious manifestation

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:36.600
of the great God and of our Savior Jesus Christ.

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:42.910
Furthermore, according to Romans 8, 24 and 25,

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:46.910
hope will help us to endure.

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:50.910
Hope that is seen is not hope.

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:53.910
But if we hope for what we do not see,

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:59.910
we keep on waiting for it with endurance, the Scripture says.

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:02.910
There are degrees of hope.

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:06.910
How can we strengthen or deepen our hope?

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:09.910
As to the term hope in the Bible,

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:11.910
the basic sense of the Greek term,

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:17.910
Elbis used here means expectation of good.

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:22.910
In this context, Paul mentions hope last in the series

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:27.910
after tribulation, endurance, and approved condition.

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:31.910
So he is obviously not referring to the initial hope

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:34.910
gained by accepting the good news from God.

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:38.910
Rather, he is referring to a reinforced hope

00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:42.910
that a Christian can gain after enduring.

00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:46.910
When a Christian faithfully endures trials,

00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:49.910
he realizes that he has God's approval.

00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:56.449
This realization strengthens his initial hope.

00:07:56.449 --> 00:08:03.449
Like Paul, we can rejoice despite persecution.

00:08:03.449 --> 00:08:07.449
We may encounter hateful words and actions at school,

00:08:07.449 --> 00:08:14.449
at work, in our family, or as a result of governmental restrictions.

00:08:14.449 --> 00:08:19.449
In Matthew, chapter 5, 11 and 12,

00:08:19.449 --> 00:08:25.449
in the sermon on the Mount, Jesus said the following.

00:08:25.449 --> 00:08:32.110
Happy are you when people reproach you and persecute you,

00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:37.110
and lyingly say every sort of wicked things against you for my sake.

00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:43.110
Rejoice and be overjoyed since your reward is great in the heavens.

00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:50.000
For in that way, they persecuted the prophets prior to you.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:57.000
As you watch the following video, note which provisions helped our brother and sister

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000
to rejoice despite this persecution.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:19.309
Early one morning, armed Russian special forces broke into my home.

00:09:19.309 --> 00:09:24.309
They handcuffed me and searched my place.

00:09:24.309 --> 00:09:27.309
They took me to the FSB office for interrogation.

00:09:27.309 --> 00:09:35.289
Two days later, the court sentenced me to pretrial detention.

00:09:35.289 --> 00:09:40.289
I was scared because I didn't know how I would be treated in prison.

00:09:40.289 --> 00:09:43.289
Threatening that things would get worse for me,

00:09:43.289 --> 00:09:47.289
the officer demanded that I incriminate myself, admit guilt,

00:09:47.289 --> 00:09:50.289
and give the names of my fellow believers.

00:09:50.289 --> 00:09:53.289
I also really missed my dear wife.

00:09:53.289 --> 00:09:55.289
It was so hard without her.

00:09:55.289 --> 00:09:59.289
For two months, I didn't have any spiritual food or a Bible.

00:09:59.289 --> 00:10:02.289
So I decided to make one.

00:10:02.289 --> 00:10:08.289
My wife sent me a notebook, and every day I wrote down verses that I was able to remember.

00:10:08.289 --> 00:10:13.289
After I had written about 500 verses, I was given a Bible.

00:10:13.289 --> 00:10:18.289
Because I was so spiritually hungry, I read it through in four months.

00:10:18.289 --> 00:10:21.289
During this time, I wrote letters to my wife and friends

00:10:21.289 --> 00:10:25.289
and shared interesting things that I learned from my reading.

00:10:25.289 --> 00:10:29.289
But the letters I received from my friends and my dear wife

00:10:29.289 --> 00:10:33.289
gave me the feeling that the brothers and sisters were so close to me,

00:10:33.289 --> 00:10:36.289
as if they were in the cells next to me.

00:10:36.289 --> 00:10:42.789
I wasn't lonely. I felt as if my friends were right there with me.

00:10:42.789 --> 00:10:46.789
Pre-trial detention isolates a person from society,

00:10:46.789 --> 00:10:50.789
but it's impossible to isolate someone from Jehovah.

00:10:50.789 --> 00:10:53.789
Throughout the day, I prayed to Jehovah many times,

00:10:53.789 --> 00:10:55.789
but I especially waited for bad time.

00:10:55.789 --> 00:10:58.789
When everyone was in bed and only the nightlight was on,

00:10:58.789 --> 00:11:02.789
I could talk to Jehovah as much as I wanted.

00:11:02.789 --> 00:11:06.789
There were times when I was all alone in the cell.

00:11:06.789 --> 00:11:09.789
And of course, I took advantage of the situation.

00:11:09.789 --> 00:11:16.789
I would get down on my knees and would literally cry as I prayed to Jehovah.

00:11:16.789 --> 00:11:20.789
I decided to write my requests to God on a sheet of paper

00:11:20.789 --> 00:11:23.789
and then mark off the ones that he answered.

00:11:23.789 --> 00:11:27.789
I was convinced that Jehovah was very close to me.

00:11:27.789 --> 00:11:31.789
I also quietly sang our songs throughout the day.

00:11:31.789 --> 00:11:35.789
But when I was all alone, I sang at the top of my voice.

00:11:35.789 --> 00:11:39.789
I also tried to give a witness whenever possible.

00:11:39.789 --> 00:11:41.789
We discussed a variety of topics,

00:11:41.789 --> 00:11:45.789
everything from tattoos to the King of the North.

00:11:45.789 --> 00:11:49.789
All my fears and anxieties were for nothing.

00:11:49.789 --> 00:11:56.789
I was in detention 343 days and not even a hair fell from my head.

00:11:56.789 --> 00:11:59.789
This was the most interesting year of my life,

00:11:59.789 --> 00:12:03.789
an excellent school to help refine my spiritual qualities.

00:12:03.789 --> 00:12:06.789
I have never felt so close to Jehovah.

00:12:06.789 --> 00:12:10.789
What a great honor to uphold God's sovereignty in this way.

00:12:10.789 --> 00:12:21.840
What is helping you today to rejoice despite any opposition

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:23.840
you may be experiencing now?

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:28.840
It is your relationship with Jehovah, the Brotherhood,

00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:35.659
your heavenly or earthly hope, all these things.

00:12:35.659 --> 00:12:41.659
Maybe rejoice in the love of Jehovah and our brothers.

00:12:41.659 --> 00:12:45.659
If you are enduring persecution, be assured that your brothers,

00:12:45.659 --> 00:12:49.659
not only your friends, not only brothers in your congregation

00:12:49.659 --> 00:12:53.659
but all around the earth are praying in your behalf.

00:12:53.659 --> 00:12:59.659
Angels observe you and feel proud if you stay faithful.

00:12:59.659 --> 00:13:05.659
You can greatly contribute to the encouragement of the faithful angels.

00:13:05.659 --> 00:13:09.659
Like Jehovah, Jesus and the angels,

00:13:09.659 --> 00:13:13.659
your brothers can take pride in you and rejoice

00:13:13.659 --> 00:13:19.659
because of your endurance and faith despite persecution.

00:13:19.659 --> 00:13:25.580
Brother William Turner and helper to the Service Committee

00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:28.580
will now present the next talk of this symposium

00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:31.580
we can rejoice despite hunger.
