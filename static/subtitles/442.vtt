00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:07.259
Now, my discussion is about the miracle of prayer.

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.539
What is one of the four most ways we draw close to?

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:16.219
We stay close to Jehovah by means of prayer.

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:23.219
In prayer, we experience Jehovah's love in a truly intimate way.

00:00:23.219 --> 00:00:30.219
The watchtower some years ago made this comment, be assured that through the miracle of prayer,

00:00:30.219 --> 00:00:33.820
Jehovah is able to listen to you.

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.579
And that's very appropriate to describe prayer as a miracle.

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:38.939
Let's think about it.

00:00:38.939 --> 00:00:44.899
You can pray in any language, even though, according to some linguists, there are more

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:48.780
than 6,800 languages spoken on the earth today.

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.740
Jehovah knows all those languages.

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:55.420
Now, we're impressed if a person knows two or three languages.

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.420
Jehovah knows every language.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:05.019
And that includes the perhaps 300 sign languages being used on earth today, according to one

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:06.019
encyclopedia.

00:01:06.019 --> 00:01:09.420
Jehovah knows every sign language.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:17.859
In fact, our prayer can be a silent prayer uttered only in the privacy of our heart.

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:23.500
Amazingly, if a faithful servant of Jehovah does not even know what to pray for because

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:31.340
of the perplexity of the situation or his mental anguish, according to Romans 8.26,

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.700
the Holy Spirit can, in effect, formulate a prayer in his behalf.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.579
Now, that is truly miraculous.

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:45.700
And as we know, Jehovah has not delegated the hearing of prayer to anyone, not even his

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.299
son.

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:55.219
From 65 to caused Jehovah the hearer of prayer, and hearer is singular.

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:57.420
But here's a question, what is prayer?

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.980
Well, some have defined it as talking to Jehovah.

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:04.980
But is that really accurate?

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:09.219
A go to Genesis chapter 3, please.

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:14.139
Let's use this scripture to answer that if it's just talking to Jehovah.

00:02:14.139 --> 00:02:23.219
Genesis chapter 3, verse 9, and Jehovah God kept calling to the man and saying to him,

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:25.419
where are you?

00:02:25.419 --> 00:02:32.819
Finally he, Adam, said, I heard your voice in the garden, but I was afraid because I

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.539
was naked, so I hid myself.

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:41.300
Well, clearly, Adam was talking to Jehovah, but it was not prayer.

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.979
We have numerous other examples in the Bible.

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:52.900
So appropriately, the insight book defines prayer as worshipful address to the true God.

00:02:52.900 --> 00:03:00.500
And then it adds, it involves devotion, trust, respect, and a sense of dependence on the

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.460
one to whom the prayer is offered.

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:04.699
So that's a very good point.

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:09.860
If we want Jehovah to view, our prayer is not just talking to him, but truly prayer

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:19.580
we've got to make sure it is worshipful address and that we attach devotion, trust, respect,

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.900
a deep sense of dependence on Jehovah.

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:29.580
And obviously, that would require that we prepare our hearts before we pray to Jehovah.

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.060
Ezra 7, 10, Ezra prepared his heart.

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.180
Well, we would do well to do the same.

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.139
But now here's another question.

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:39.819
What are the different types of prayer?

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:45.300
Well, our publications have explained there are basically four types of prayer.

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:51.419
We have petition, supplication, thanksgiving, and praise.

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:56.060
And if you boil it down even further, you can say there's two types of prayer.

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:02.939
Petition and thanksgiving because supplication is really a form of petition, just very deep

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:05.139
petition, but petition.

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:09.139
And praise is a form of thanksgiving.

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:13.139
Making Jehovah for being the God that he is.

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:18.939
But let's briefly talk about these four categories of prayer we can divide it into.

00:04:18.939 --> 00:04:21.300
Take first petition.

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:26.339
Just like it sounds, we're asking, we're requesting of Jehovah and Jehovah encourages

00:04:26.339 --> 00:04:30.100
us to ask him for our needs.

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:36.980
At Matthew 7, 7, Jesus said, keep on asking and it will be given you.

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:42.939
Keep on seeking and you will find, keep on knocking and it will be open to you.

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:48.259
And of course, Jesus gives us things we can pray for, our daily bread, forgiveness of

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:52.899
our sins, deliverance from the evil one as a few examples.

00:04:52.899 --> 00:04:55.779
But now let's take supplication.

00:04:55.779 --> 00:05:02.100
The watchtower explains, the word means earnest and treaty, besieging prayer.

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:09.540
It involves imploring God very earnestly as in time of great stress or peril.

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:16.420
If you want to think of a modern example of supplication, think of a wife's prayer the

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:22.899
night before her husband is executed for keeping his integrity.

00:05:22.899 --> 00:05:24.660
That would truly be supplication.

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:31.819
Now, let's go to thanksgiving as it sounds, it's the rendering of thanks to Jehovah.

00:05:31.819 --> 00:05:38.379
And how voluminous are the things for which we should express gratitude to Jehovah?

00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:46.699
Let me think about all the material physical gifts that not only make life possible, but

00:05:46.699 --> 00:05:49.579
make it enjoyable.

00:05:49.579 --> 00:05:54.379
Every good gift, every perfect present comes from Jehovah, James 117.

00:05:54.379 --> 00:06:00.000
And then what about the spiritual gifts, Jehovah showers upon us, the benefits of the

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:08.800
ransom sacrifice, the Holy Spirit, God's Word, the Christian congregation, our marvelous

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:12.800
kingdom hope, just to mention a few things.

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:20.120
It is only right that we thank Jehovah for the things he has done is doing and will yet

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.319
do in the future.

00:06:22.319 --> 00:06:29.879
As Paul said at Ephesians 520, we should be always giving thanks to our God and Father

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:32.199
for everything.

00:06:32.199 --> 00:06:34.720
But now let's move to praise.

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:42.720
Praise is a noble, exalted form of prayer, as we said before, closely related to thanksgiving.

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:48.639
We could look at it this way, thanksgiving, we thank Jehovah for the gifts he gives us.

00:06:48.639 --> 00:06:56.000
Praise we thank Jehovah for being the God he is and the qualities he has that we appreciate

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.600
so much see.

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:02.240
One brother said that praise is bragging on Jehovah.

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:08.639
And that really harmonizes with what Paul said at 1 Corinthians 131, the one who boasts,

00:07:08.639 --> 00:07:12.439
let him boast in Jehovah.

00:07:12.439 --> 00:07:14.879
Jehovah is above all others.

00:07:14.879 --> 00:07:18.720
He is certainly deserving of praise.

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:23.399
Exodus 15 and verse 11 tells us this.

00:07:23.399 --> 00:07:29.319
It says, Who among the gods is like you, O Jehovah?

00:07:29.319 --> 00:07:33.759
Who is like you, showing yourself mighty in holiness?

00:07:33.759 --> 00:07:39.720
The one to be feared with songs of praise, the one doing wonders.

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:46.160
Yes, Jehovah is worthy of our words and our songs of praise.

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:49.480
Well, there we have four types of prayer.

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:56.040
We mention petition, supplication, thanksgiving, and praise.

00:07:56.040 --> 00:08:03.079
And obviously, we should endeavor to try to balance our prayers using a combination of

00:08:03.079 --> 00:08:05.360
these different aspects of prayer.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:10.720
Now, if we're not careful, especially there's a danger that our prayers could become

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:14.439
lopsided with petition.

00:08:14.439 --> 00:08:17.120
Now that would be not good, would it?

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:23.759
In fact, I think of a survey that the awake commented on in watching the world, a survey

00:08:23.759 --> 00:08:29.839
among people who prayed, and among those who still pray, that survey showed that most

00:08:29.839 --> 00:08:34.000
of them, their prayers are only petition.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:40.039
And then it said, they view God as like a divine Santa Claus.

00:08:40.039 --> 00:08:43.759
Give me this, give me that, help me with this, do this for me.

00:08:43.759 --> 00:08:50.120
We wouldn't want our prayers to even slightly take on a selfish tenor like that.

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:55.480
And what probably is the weakest aspect of most prayers?

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:57.080
Probably praise.

00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:02.519
If we're not careful, our prayers could lack sufficient praise for Jehovah, and that would

00:09:02.519 --> 00:09:06.960
be sad because he is so deserving of praise.

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:12.279
Well, may we persevere in prayer, Romans 12-12.

00:09:12.279 --> 00:09:20.480
May we pray constantly, 1 Thessalonians 5-17, and may we strive to keep our prayers balanced

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:28.320
and heartfelt, truly worshipful address to our Heavenly Father, and this will help us

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:34.320
to draw close and stay close to our wonderful Heavenly Father.
