00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.750
You can hear the songbirds singing

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.750
And you watch the clouds roll by

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.750
Then you're walking in the valley

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.750
As the sun shines in a clear blue sky

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.750
You're welcoming your loved ones

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.750
And you can't believe

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:40.420
Yes, this earthly paradise

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.420
Was just around the corner

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:52.250
There's a house down in the valley

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.250
And a house high on

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:59.880
They're singing by the river

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.880
As the water flows and turns the milk

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.879
The golden fields are waiting

00:01:07.879 --> 00:01:11.879
Let the harvesting begin

00:01:11.879 --> 00:01:15.879
Once the world we're living in

00:01:15.879 --> 00:01:19.879
Was just around the corner

00:01:19.879 --> 00:01:23.879
It's great to share with friends who care

00:01:23.879 --> 00:01:27.879
The things that we looked forward to

00:01:27.879 --> 00:01:31.879
Now every tear has disappeared

00:01:31.879 --> 00:01:33.879
The world is young

00:01:33.879 --> 00:01:35.879
And life is new

00:01:35.879 --> 00:01:39.879
There's the sound of happy voices

00:01:39.879 --> 00:01:43.879
And the scent of new morn hay

00:01:43.879 --> 00:01:47.879
Now you're calling to your loved ones

00:01:47.879 --> 00:01:51.879
As you start another perfect day

00:01:51.879 --> 00:01:53.879
Then we thank for his tend

00:01:53.879 --> 00:02:03.609
Yes, the blessings we all share

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:07.609
Were just around the corner

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:12.229
A smile and say

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:16.229
How good to see your happy face

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:18.229
Because once it seemed

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:22.229
I only dreamed that you'd be in waste

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:27.610
Waiting round the corner

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.610
Is a world I long to see

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.610
It's a promise from Jehovah

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.610
It's a guarantee reality

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.610
And it's hard to get down hard in

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.610
When I think of what's in store

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.610
It's the day I'm waiting for

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.610
And it's just around the corner
