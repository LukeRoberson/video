00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:11.199
Jehovah God has the purpose of gathering His people out of Satan's world into His congregation.

00:00:11.199 --> 00:00:20.199
Christ Jesus promised us that He would be with us until the conclusion of the system of things.

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:28.199
When we see this huge organization worldwide, we know that Jesus is fulfilling His promise

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.200
and Jehovah is executing His purposes in a wonderful way.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:41.200
This huge organization has many services or ministries associated with it.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.200
It can only be accomplished by means of Jehovah.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:49.200
He is the orchestrator of this organization.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:01:00.200
The apostle Paul, here in 1 Corinthians chapter 12, explains in great detail how Jehovah organizes His organization.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:12.200
If we look at verse 14 of 1 Corinthians chapter 12, it says, indeed the body is made up not of one member but of many.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:24.200
So Paul is using the body, the human body as an analogy of the organization and it has many members.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.200
Each individual member is assigned a ministry.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.200
Let us read here verses 4 through 6.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:38.200
It says, now there are different gifts but there is the same spirit.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:45.200
And there are different ministries and yet there is the same Lord.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:54.200
And there are different activities and yet it is the same God who performs them all in everyone.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.200
This reminds us that this organization does not belong to any man.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.200
No human is putting it together.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.200
No human is moving it along.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.200
It is Jehovah God Himself.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:14.199
And we are held by Paul in this chapter to understand our relationship to one another.

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:19.199
Let us read here verses 17 and 19 and 21.

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:30.199
It says, 1 Corinthians 12, 17, if the whole body were an eye, where would the sense of hearing be?

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:35.199
If it were all hearing, where would the sense of smell be?

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:41.199
19, if they were all the same member, where would the body be?

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:53.199
And 21, the eye cannot say to the hand, I do not need you or again the head cannot say to the feet, I do not need you.

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:56.199
We all understand we need each other.

00:02:56.199 --> 00:03:02.199
We do different operations or ministries but we need each other very much.

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:11.199
And that is why it says in verse 20, now they are many members yet one body.

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:13.199
We are still one body.

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:16.199
We belong to the same congregation.

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:20.199
Now this brings us to the text for today in verse 22.

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:26.199
Where Paul says, on the contrary, the members of the body that seem to be weaker are necessary.

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:29.199
So weaker in this context, what does it mean?

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:35.199
It does not refer that this member is deficient or not able to do their work.

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:42.199
No, it just means that this member may be from a physical point of view, seem weaker.

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:52.199
Maybe we have an older brother suffering with some illness and he cannot do as much as he used to do.

00:03:52.199 --> 00:04:01.199
Does it mean that he is not fulfilling his assignment or that he does not fit into God's arrangement or that he is useless to Jehovah?

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:02.199
Not at all.

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:06.199
He may seem to be weaker.

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:11.199
But we understand how that works and we appreciate God's arrangement.

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:21.199
Look what says in verse 23, and the parts of the body that we think to be less honorable, we surround with greater honor.

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:26.199
So our unseemly parts are treated with greater modesty.

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:28.199
And this is God's arrangement.

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:33.199
Verse 24 says, whereas our attractive parts do not need anything.

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:45.310
Nevertheless, God has so composed the body, giving greater honor to the part that had a lack.

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:48.310
So there is no division in the body.

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:59.310
It cooperates. You do not have members looking down on others because of their inability or limited circumstances.

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:10.310
That's why it says in verse 25, so that there should be no division in the body, but his members should have mutual concern for one another.

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:14.680
How does this work?

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:19.680
How has Jehovah arranged and orchestrated this organization?

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:26.680
It's beautifully described by Paul in Ephesians chapter 4 and verse 16.

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:38.680
Now in verse 15, year in Ephesians 4, Paul says that, let us by love grow up in all things into him who is the head Christ.

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.680
Christ Jesus is the head.

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.680
There's no pyramid structure.

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:47.680
Christ said, your leader is one.

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:58.680
And then it says from verse 16, the first part of verse 16, it explains how Jehovah God organizes his people.

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:11.680
It says from him, from Christ, all the body is harmoniously joined together and made to cooperate through every joint that gives what is needed.

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:15.680
So it is harmoniously joined together.

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:22.680
It's like the human hand. The fingers are joined by the palm. The palm is joined to the wrist.

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:30.680
There is a harmonious joining together and then it says here they are made to cooperate.

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:35.680
So they have been designed to fit together, to cooperate, to work together.

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:37.680
This is what Jehovah God does.

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:41.680
But then the second part of the verse shows what we need to do.

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:50.680
It says we need to give what is needed and then it says when each respective member functions properly.

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:58.680
This contributes to the growth of the body as it builds itself up in love.

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:04.680
So that is our function, to give what is needed, to do what is required.

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:08.680
Jesus illustrated that so beautifully for us in John 13.

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:12.680
You remember the time when He washed the feet of the disciples.

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:29.589
We turned it to John 13 and if we look at verse 12 through 15, Jesus explained what He did and He explains the purpose of this.

00:07:29.589 --> 00:07:39.589
It says when now He had washed the feet and had put His outer garments on, He again reclined at the table and said to them,

00:07:39.589 --> 00:07:43.589
do you understand what I have done to you?

00:07:43.589 --> 00:07:49.589
You address me as teacher and Lord and you are correct for I am such.

00:07:49.589 --> 00:07:57.589
Therefore if I, the Lord and teacher washed your feet, you also should wash the feet of one another.

00:07:57.589 --> 00:08:04.589
Therefore I set the pattern for you that just as I did to you, you should also do.

00:08:04.589 --> 00:08:14.589
So imagine here is Jesus, the head of the congregation, got down on His knees and washed the feet of His disciples.

00:08:14.589 --> 00:08:20.589
And then He said we must follow that example.

00:08:20.589 --> 00:08:24.589
So what is the purpose of this arrangement?

00:08:24.589 --> 00:08:28.589
Each of us foot into God's arrangement.

00:08:28.589 --> 00:08:38.590
All of us have a function, a beautiful function that is to serve one another, give what is needed.

00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:44.590
As it is stated there in Ephesians, the final part of verse 16 as we read,

00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:52.590
this contributes to the growth of the body as it builds itself up in love.

00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:57.590
So Jehovah has made this wonderful arrangement of gathering His people together.

00:08:57.590 --> 00:09:05.590
He will take this organization, this congregation of people through into the righteous new system of things.

00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:16.590
We will experience wonderful blessings, but right now it is our opportunity to cooperate and to work together in love and unity.

00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:22.590
And that way whether we are weaker or stronger from a physical point of view does not matter.

00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:25.590
We are all part of the same body.
