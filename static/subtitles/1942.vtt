00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:09.619
Ever since the first humans rejected Jehovah God as ruler,

00:00:09.619 --> 00:00:13.619
our world has been plagued with evil and suffering.

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:16.620
But Jesus offered hope.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.620
He taught that as king of God's kingdom,

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:22.620
He would restore peace and justice to the earth.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.620
But when would that kingdom begin to rule?

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:29.620
According to the Bible, it is ruling right now.

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:31.620
How do we know that?

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:35.619
Consider what happened over 2,600 years ago.

00:00:35.619 --> 00:00:40.090
Jehovah God caused Nebuchadnezzar,

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.090
a king of ancient Babylon, to have a prophetic dream.

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.090
In the dream, Nebuchadnezzar saw a giant tree

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.090
that reached all the way to heaven.

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:55.090
The tree was cut down, but its stump was left in the ground.

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:01.090
After a period of seven times, the tree grew again.

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:06.090
The Bible indicates that this dream would have two fulfillments.

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.090
The first had to do with King Nebuchadnezzar himself.

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:15.090
He was very prominent, like the tree that reached all the way to heaven.

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.090
But he was cut down for seven times.

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:25.090
This happened when Nebuchadnezzar lost his sanity for seven years.

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.090
During that time, he was unable to rule this king.

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.430
At the end of the seven times, Nebuchadnezzar regained his sanity

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.430
and started ruling again.

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.430
That was the first fulfillment of this prophecy.

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.430
What was the second fulfillment?

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.430
It had to do with God's rulership.

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:54.430
The Bible says that kings in ancient Israel sat on Jehovah's throne.

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:00.430
In other words, they represented God and his rulership.

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:06.430
However, most of those kings became disobedient to Jehovah

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.430
and so did most of their subjects.

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:16.430
Because of their disobedience, God allowed the Israelites to be conquered by the Babylonians

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.430
who destroyed the city of Jerusalem in 607 BCE.

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:27.430
From that time on, no more kings represented Jehovah in Jerusalem.

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:34.430
Thus, 607 BCE marked the beginning of the seven times

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.430
or the period when God's rulership would be interrupted.

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.430
That period would last until Jehovah installed a new king to represent him.

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.430
This time, someone in heaven.

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.430
When would that happen?

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.430
In the second fulfillment of this prophecy,

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.430
the seven times must be more than seven literal years.

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.430
How do we know?

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:03.430
For one thing, nothing significant relating to God's rulership happened

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.430
seven years after Jerusalem was destroyed.

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:14.430
And centuries later, Jesus indicated that the seven times had not yet ended.

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.430
In a prophecy about the last days,

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.430
Jesus said that Jerusalem, or God's rulership,

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:28.430
would be trampled on by the nations until the appointed times of the nations are fulfilled.

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:34.430
The appointed times of the nations are the same as the seven times.

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.430
When would those times end?

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.430
The Bible book of Revelation says that

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:47.430
three and a half times equal 1,260 days.

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:53.430
So seven times is double that number, or 2,520 days.

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:58.430
In Bible prophecy, a day can represent a year.

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:03.430
That is the case with the prophecy about the seven times.

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:09.430
They represent 2,520 years.

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.430
Counting forward from 607 BCE,

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:19.430
2,520 years takes us to the year 1914,

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.430
the year that the seven times ended

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:27.430
and Jesus began ruling from heaven as king of God's kingdom.

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:33.430
That began a period that the Bible calls the last days.

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:38.430
Soon, Jesus will finish gathering the rest of his co-rollers

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.430
to join him in heaven.

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:47.430
God's kingdom will then undo every problem that afflicts us and our families.

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:54.430
Imagine living there under the rulership of a king who really cares about you.
