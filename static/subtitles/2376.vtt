00:00:10.859 --> 00:00:21.859
Every year, plants, bacteria, and algae Earth-wide make around 150 billion metric tons of food

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:28.539
for themselves and almost every other living thing on Earth.

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:31.899
How do they do it?

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:37.270
Photosynthesis.

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:43.149
In plants, this astonishingly intricate process takes place in a highly organized structure

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:50.509
called a chloroplast, where a green pigment, chlorophyll, and other pigments collect and

00:00:50.509 --> 00:00:57.679
use the energy from visible light with amazing efficiency.

00:00:57.679 --> 00:01:03.439
In photosynthesis, this energy is used to do something that happens nowhere else in the

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:10.480
natural world, split water into hydrogen ions and oxygen molecules.

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:15.400
Hydrogen ions combine with carbon dioxide to make sugar, which can be used by plants to

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:22.989
make all the other complex molecules that they need to grow.

00:01:22.989 --> 00:01:27.909
Most of the oxygen is expelled as an unused byproduct.

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:34.239
One that we can't move without.

00:01:34.239 --> 00:01:40.760
About half of the oxygen we and other organisms breathe comes from phytoplankton, microscopic

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:44.599
organisms that drift in the ocean.

00:01:44.599 --> 00:01:51.159
And the smallest one yet discovered, a cyanobacterium, is also the most abundant.

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:56.799
Though invisible to the naked eye, these bacteria alone produce around one fifth of the oxygen

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:59.319
on Earth.

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:06.799
Nearly all living things need oxygen, and they depend on other life forms to make it.

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:13.020
The amazingly complex process of combining carbon dioxide with the water that constantly

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:20.439
cycles on our planet and energy from the sun gives us every bite of food and every breath

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:23.759
of air we need.

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:25.520
What do you think?

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.120
Did photosynthesis evolve or was it designed?
