00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:10.009
How does it make you feel knowing God's support is real and that He's entrusted us to do the work we do?

00:00:11.169 --> 00:00:14.009
We know that song. We love that song.

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:18.129
But I'd be able to stop to meditate on the lyrics.

00:00:19.489 --> 00:00:21.489
How do we feel?

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.570
Because really, it's such a tremendous, amazing privilege that Jehovah has entrusted to his people

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:31.410
the work of kingdom preaching and disciple making.

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:38.049
Now, while the work at Bethel contributes to the preaching work in a very precious and unique way,

00:00:39.009 --> 00:00:44.289
we still recognize it's quite special to be able to assist someone in the ministry

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:50.689
and watch them progress to the point of making a dedication and symbolizing that by water baptism.

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:57.009
Our text comments mentions the qualities of gratitude and undeserved kindness.

00:00:57.729 --> 00:01:03.729
And these are good qualities because they're qualities that motivate us, that move us to action,

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.530
that touch our emotions. Now, why is this emotional investment so important

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:18.530
when it comes to our ministry? Well, think for example of our greatest teacher and preacher

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.730
whoever walked the earth and that is Jesus Christ. Turn with me and your Bibles,

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:33.019
please, to Luke chapter 19. And we'll just take a look at one instance of how Jesus demonstrated

00:01:33.019 --> 00:01:44.260
this love and concern. Luke chapter 19 verse 41, it says, and when he, that is Jesus,

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:52.819
got nearby, he viewed the city, Jerusalem, and wept over it.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:02.180
How interesting, Jesus' heart was filled with so much emotion that his eyes brimmed over

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:07.060
with tears when he contemplated the people, their rejection of the message,

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:14.180
the siege that was to follow. Doesn't I show his love for people? And obviously that love

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.300
was made evident the entire time that he was here on the earth.

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:24.340
Now, we may not give way to tears every time we go into our territory and engage in the ministry

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:30.659
but certainly we want to imitate Jesus' example because it's so vital that we have and demonstrate

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:37.460
love for people. It reminds me of a conversation I had with a missionary sister some time ago.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:42.020
And at the time she was reviewing her personal circumstances and she felt that at that time she

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:47.060
could comfortably handle 10 Bible studies. So I asked her how things were going. She said,

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:52.819
well, actually I have 20. She says I was able to get rid of six. She says, but I just can't turn

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:59.379
over these last four. She says there's such a part of my life. I just can't let them go.

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:06.979
I don't sound like a good problem to have, but doesn't it highlight her love for people? She was

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:15.060
emotionally invested. Now, we also have to admit that while preaching is a wonderful work,

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:23.460
actually carrying it out is not always easy to do. Perhaps at times we may feel like the prophet

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:29.219
Jeremiah. You recall when he was commissioned as a prophet, he gave Jehovah a number of reasons

00:03:29.219 --> 00:03:36.819
why he shouldn't be selected. He was too shy, too young, wasn't able to speak well. And then once

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:41.939
he got into his assignment and the opposition and the ridicule started, well, let's take note of

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:53.099
his feelings. Turn with me please to Jeremiah in chapter 20. Jeremiah in chapter 20 will begin with

00:03:53.099 --> 00:04:03.180
the B part of verse 8. For me, the word of Jehovah has been the cause of insults and jeering all day long.

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:11.659
So I said, I am not going to make mention of him. And I will speak no more in his name.

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:20.420
Have you ever had times where you felt like Jeremiah where we just didn't have the desire

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:26.740
or feel like speaking to others about Jehovah? And maybe it was for similar reasons.

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:36.540
We're shy. We feel nervous. People in the territory are indifferent. Or could it just be that we're

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:45.980
just tired? The energy that we feel we need, we just don't have it. As a normal to feel this way

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:53.819
at times, absolutely. But let's take note of what Jeremiah says next. Let's finish verse 9.

00:04:55.100 --> 00:05:02.779
He says, but in my heart, it became like a burning fire shut up in my bones. And I was tired of

00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:10.379
holding it in. I could no longer endure it. You notice it was Jeremiah's love for Jehovah, his

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:16.220
zeal for the truth, his strong spirituality. All of these were things that were able to help him

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:24.139
remain invested and be able to overcome any temporary discouragement he might have been feeling

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:30.860
at that time. So what can help us to stay invested to maintain our love for people?

00:05:31.819 --> 00:05:38.459
Well, there are many ways, but we'll discuss too. First, Jeremiah's example shows us that there

00:05:38.459 --> 00:05:47.339
is never a substitute for study of God's word. Did you notice what was that burning fire shut up

00:05:47.339 --> 00:05:56.939
in his bones? Verse 8 tells us it was the word of Jehovah. So it was Jeremiah's appreciation for

00:05:56.939 --> 00:06:03.100
the importance of his message that made him responsive to the encouragement he received

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:11.660
when he read God's word. And it works the same for us as well. Study of God's word helps to

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:17.100
reinforce our love for Jehovah. It's a constant reminder that we're living in the last days,

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:21.980
that we're deep in the time of the end, and we need to do all that we can to find those who are

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:30.060
rightly disposed for everlasting life. Yes, it is natural. We are going to experience discouragement

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:37.019
from time to time. But when we pray to Jehovah for help, you see, if his word is in our hearts,

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:43.899
then Jehovah can freely impart his Holy Spirit to us. He can give us what we need to be

00:06:43.899 --> 00:06:49.019
boldly preachers of the good news and be productive in our ministry.

00:06:50.699 --> 00:06:56.699
Now, the second thing that can help us is by applying the suggestions that are given to us by

00:06:56.699 --> 00:07:04.060
the slave to help us improve our ministry. Now, perhaps in the past, preaching may have been

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:09.660
difficult, maybe because of just pressure we put upon ourselves. Perhaps we may have felt that

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:14.699
we had to have the perfect presentation, or we had to place a certain amount of literature.

00:07:15.819 --> 00:07:19.899
But how loving it is that we see that with the various adjustments that have been made in our

00:07:19.899 --> 00:07:25.819
ministry, well, hopefully some of that anxiety has been lifted, because now we know our focus is on

00:07:25.819 --> 00:07:32.379
starting conversations. And with the help of prayer and God's spirit, we can see how that just

00:07:32.379 --> 00:07:38.139
naturally progresses into a witness. We just think back for a moment to the example of Jesus. We

00:07:38.139 --> 00:07:45.899
can only imagine how many preaching opportunities Jesus must have had just from starting conversations.

00:07:46.939 --> 00:07:51.180
Of course, the one we're most familiar with to John chapter four, the Samaritan woman at the

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:58.300
well, not only was that a great witness, but just think about all of those who became believers

00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:06.379
afterward. And all of that started simply from Jesus starting a conversation asking for water.

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:13.699
We may not always have as many opportunities as Bethel to engage in the house to house work as we

00:08:13.699 --> 00:08:20.819
would like, but certainly as we travel, as we move about, this can present greater opportunities

00:08:20.819 --> 00:08:26.100
to start conversations. In last month's meeting workbook, there was an article

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:32.580
starting conversations that can lead to a witness. And that article just provided many excellent

00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:39.220
practical suggestions that we can implement. So if we follow these suggestions, well,

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:45.220
this is a nice way that we can show and demonstrate our gratitude. We're making the best

00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:50.419
use of our time to start a witness. So as we mentioned, there are many ways that we can show our

00:08:50.419 --> 00:08:56.019
gratitude, but certainly these two, our study of God's Word, applying the suggestions to improve

00:08:56.019 --> 00:09:04.659
our ministry, our two ways that we can certainly implement. So an implementation of Jesus, Jeremiah,

00:09:04.659 --> 00:09:10.500
many other faithful witnesses of Jehovah, may we do what we can to show that we are invested,

00:09:11.059 --> 00:09:17.779
that we show our love for God, our love for people, as we appreciatively carry out our commission

00:09:17.779 --> 00:09:19.379
to preach the good news.
