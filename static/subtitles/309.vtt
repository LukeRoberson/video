00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:16.100
Hey Gabe!

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.100
Hey Olivia! How's it going?

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.100
Uh, you know, it's going good.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.100
Just doing another letter writing territory.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.100
So, you know how that is.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.100
Okay, well?

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.100
Yay!

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.100
Good to see you!

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.100
Hey Sue, it's good to see you too.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.100
Is that Gabe?

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.100
Oh hey baby, how's that though?

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.100
Hey mom, it's busy but great.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.100
I'm learning a lot.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.100
Oh look who just got home from work!

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.100
Hey Gabe!

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.100
Hey Max!

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.100
So, if it's possible,

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.100
can you send me some more of my things?

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.100
I can text you a list.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.100
Absolutely, I'll get right on it.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.100
Great, thank you so much.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.100
Olivia, I'll let you get back to letter writing.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.100
Great.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.100
Hey!

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.100
Alright, we'll let you go, love you!

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.100
Okay, love you too.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.100
Bye!

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.100
Bye!

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:07.359
So Olivia,

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:09.359
I thought that you enjoyed letter writing.

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:11.359
I don't know.

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:15.359
It just feels like another letter,

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:17.359
another envelope,

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:19.359
another envelope,

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:21.359
and another black hole.

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:22.359
Black hole?

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:24.359
Yeah, you know, stuff goes in,

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:27.359
but nothing ever comes out of it.

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:29.359
It's not that bad.

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:30.359
What do you mean?

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:34.359
You were just telling me that no one's responded to you.

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:35.359
Okay.

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:38.359
Yeah, I get a little antsy for replies.

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:41.359
Like I texted my old classmate Sarah,

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:45.609
but she just hasn't said anything back to me yet.

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:47.609
I just hope I didn't overdo it.

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:48.609
What do you think?

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:52.980
Is it too much?

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:54.980
Do you think it's too much?

00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:01.200
It's too much.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.200
Sure, so, uh...

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.200
Sure, so you get back to you.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:14.460
Alright.

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.460
Is everything on Gabe's list?

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.460
Thank you.

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.460
At least we'll have a little more room

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.460
for when your mom moves in.

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.460
Yeah.

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:28.460
Anyway, Gabe will love this.

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.460
He already told me how much he missed his fishing.

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:39.189
What if we do something a little different

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:40.189
for family worship this week?

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:41.189
Sure.

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:49.259
So, this is where you and Gabe would fish, right?

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:51.259
Yeah.

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:55.539
We learned a lot of lessons about fishing here.

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:56.539
So lately,

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:59.539
preachings felt like a black hole, right?

00:02:59.539 --> 00:03:02.539
We have the right equipment.

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:05.539
But what does a fisherman need more than anything?

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:12.020
Second Corinthians 6'4.

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:16.680
It says, but in every way we recommend ourselves

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.680
as God's ministers by...

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.680
Now, what is verse 6, say, Olivia?

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.680
It says, by purity, by knowledge, by patience.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.680
Patience.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.680
It helps us to keep trying,

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.680
again and again,

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.680
to not give up.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.680
And we're not casting into a black hole,

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.680
but into a blue sea full of deserving ones.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.680
Now, maybe we can't see it,

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.680
but Jehovah knows they're there.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.680
And it may take some time,

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:55.460
but if we're patient, together, we'll find them.

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:57.460
All right, Rian's got some great ideas

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:12.740
on how to make our letter writing.

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:14.740
Already for section 2, right?

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:15.740
Guess so.

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:16.740
Okay.

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:20.740
Well, first we'll see how false religion gets God totally wrong.

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:22.740
Did you get a chance to study?

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.740
Yeah, I...

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.740
I ran ahead.

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.740
Like, is... is everything okay?

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.740
I'm fine. Let's just...

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:33.740
get started.

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.740
Okay, so then we'll watch a video on churches

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:38.740
during World War II,

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:44.819
and why Jehovah will have no choice but to...

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:46.819
some things up.

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:48.819
What's wrong?

00:04:48.819 --> 00:04:50.819
I don't know, I just...

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:53.819
I read that all religions are false.

00:04:53.819 --> 00:04:55.819
Well, yeah, but you have to remember that...

00:04:55.819 --> 00:04:58.819
I don't know, it's just...

00:04:58.819 --> 00:05:01.620
what?

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.620
It's just all getting so...

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.620
so serious.

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:11.620
Well, yeah, it's life and death.

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:15.620
Why waste time on the study if she's not going to take it serious?

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:17.620
So you said all of that to her?

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:18.620
No.

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:20.620
Just the will, yeah, part.

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.620
But I wanted to.

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:26.620
She used to be so excited for study.

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:27.620
I don't know.

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:29.620
Maybe she's just not getting it.

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:32.620
I think she is learning.

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:34.620
Maybe it's just really thinking in.

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.620
If it's thinking in, then what's the problem?

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:48.509
Maybe it's me.

00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:51.509
You know what really helped me when I first started pioneering?

00:05:51.509 --> 00:05:56.509
I learned that Jesus had to be patient with His disciples.

00:05:56.509 --> 00:06:00.509
They weren't always ready to learn the things that He was teaching them.

00:06:00.509 --> 00:06:03.509
That means that we have to be patient with our Bible students, too.

00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:07.850
Let it reach your heart.

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:11.699
And be patient with yourself.

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:18.189
I was thinking a lot about our study.

00:06:18.189 --> 00:06:21.189
And I really wanted to know how...

00:06:21.189 --> 00:06:23.189
how you were feeling about it.

00:06:23.189 --> 00:06:27.910
As I was reading it had...

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:30.910
it finally hit me.

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:33.910
All the churches in the world are lying.

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:35.910
My mom's included.

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:39.910
And God's just going to destroy them all.

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:42.910
You know, maybe I'm just...

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:44.910
not ready for some of this.

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:52.389
I understand where you're coming from.

00:06:52.389 --> 00:06:58.389
Give yourself some time to learn why Jehovah's ways are just.

00:06:58.389 --> 00:07:01.389
The better you get to know Him,

00:07:01.389 --> 00:07:04.389
the more His teachings are going to touch your heart.

00:07:04.389 --> 00:07:09.079
Trust me.

00:07:09.079 --> 00:07:12.079
I promise you it'll be worth the wait.

00:07:15.149 --> 00:07:16.149
Okay.

00:07:16.149 --> 00:07:17.149
Yeah?

00:07:17.149 --> 00:07:18.149
Okay.

00:07:18.149 --> 00:07:21.149
So, let's get to know Jehovah better.

00:07:21.149 --> 00:07:46.279
Do you remember?

00:07:46.279 --> 00:07:48.279
He's just going to be working even more.

00:07:48.279 --> 00:07:49.279
I just don't know what.

00:07:49.279 --> 00:07:55.019
Could you...

00:07:55.019 --> 00:07:57.019
Are you still listening to me?

00:07:57.019 --> 00:07:59.970
Uh-huh.

00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:01.970
I don't have the support I need, you know?

00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:02.970
I know.

00:08:02.970 --> 00:08:03.970
And it never seems to end.

00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:06.970
I don't know why this keeps happening to me.

00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:08.970
I know it seems that way,

00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:15.310
but sometimes the decisions you make have consequences that don't go away.

00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:17.310
Excuse me?

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:22.819
Not everyone is perfect, like you.

00:08:22.819 --> 00:08:23.819
I'm sorry.

00:08:23.819 --> 00:08:25.819
That's not what I meant.

00:08:25.819 --> 00:08:26.819
I...

00:08:26.819 --> 00:08:28.819
I don't have time for this.

00:08:28.819 --> 00:08:32.669
I'm sorry, that's not what I meant.

00:08:32.669 --> 00:08:34.669
Everything okay?

00:08:34.669 --> 00:08:36.669
Dora just hung up on me.

00:08:36.669 --> 00:08:39.669
Well, maybe she was just having a bad day.

00:08:39.669 --> 00:08:42.669
Every day is a bad day for Dora.

00:08:42.669 --> 00:08:46.669
It's not my fault that she married that guy from work.

00:08:46.669 --> 00:08:48.669
I just wish she would have listened.

00:08:48.669 --> 00:09:01.340
She has made some bad decisions.

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:04.340
But that was years ago.

00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:05.340
Don't give up on her.

00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:07.340
I'm not giving up on her.

00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:09.340
I just need a break from her.

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:14.029
I know this isn't easy.

00:09:14.029 --> 00:09:20.029
But try and imagine what it must be like for her.

00:09:20.029 --> 00:10:22.190
Makes me think about first Thessalonians 5-11.

00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:28.470
Keep encouraging one another and building one another up,

00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:31.470
just as you were in fact doing.

00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:34.470
We can do so much good when we're patient,

00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:37.909
just like Jehovah is with us.

00:10:37.909 --> 00:11:00.059
Hiring was calling because I wanted to apologize for what I said.

00:11:00.059 --> 00:11:04.419
I'm sorry too.

00:11:04.419 --> 00:11:07.990
I um...

00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:10.990
I know that you're dealing with a lot right now.

00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:15.460
How much you left Jehovah?

00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:21.570
I just want you to know I'm always here for you.

00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:22.570
Thanks, Larry.

00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:27.129
That really means a lot to me.

00:11:27.129 --> 00:11:30.889
You know, um...

00:11:30.889 --> 00:11:33.889
I was thinking about going out to service tomorrow.

00:11:33.889 --> 00:11:35.889
Would you like to go with me?

00:11:35.889 --> 00:11:36.889
I'd love to go.

00:11:36.889 --> 00:11:46.059
So these are our public talk schedules.

00:11:46.059 --> 00:11:47.059
Wait.

00:11:47.059 --> 00:11:48.059
Hey, sister Jones.

00:11:48.059 --> 00:11:50.059
Hey, what are you two up to?

00:11:50.059 --> 00:11:53.059
Wayne's gonna be helping with public talk scheduling.

00:11:53.059 --> 00:11:54.059
Oh great.

00:11:54.059 --> 00:11:59.460
Wow, let y'all get to it.

00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:01.460
So, we already have these weeks scheduled.

00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:04.460
We just need to keep confirming with the speakers

00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:07.460
and quickly replacing any cancellations.

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:08.460
That's pretty important.

00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:10.460
I can totally do that.

00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:12.460
I actually asked some new ideas on how to handle that.

00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:14.460
Okay, good.

00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:15.460
Um...

00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:17.460
But a phone call should be found.

00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:18.460
Don't worry.

00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:20.460
It's not that hard I can handle it.

00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:24.460
Can I show you my idea on how to streamline the process?

00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:26.460
More than a phone call?

00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:27.460
Yeah.

00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:31.629
The speaker isn't here.

00:12:31.629 --> 00:12:32.629
I'm sorry, what?

00:12:32.629 --> 00:12:35.629
Did you call and confirm like I asked you to?

00:12:35.629 --> 00:12:38.230
No.

00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:46.629
But what can I do?

00:12:46.629 --> 00:12:48.629
Nothing now.

00:12:48.629 --> 00:12:53.799
I'll take care of it.

00:12:53.799 --> 00:12:56.799
Wayne forgot to confirm the speaker, so I have to give the talk now.

00:12:56.799 --> 00:13:17.419
You did a nice job on your part.

00:13:17.419 --> 00:13:21.700
Thanks.

00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:22.700
Wayne just forgot.

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:38.539
Hey, Gabe.

00:13:38.539 --> 00:13:41.370
Doing good.

00:13:41.370 --> 00:13:42.370
How are you?

00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:43.370
Good.

00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:46.799
I came on the...

00:13:46.799 --> 00:13:53.629
Oh, that's weird.

00:13:53.629 --> 00:13:55.629
That's my fault, Gabe.

00:13:55.629 --> 00:13:57.629
I completely forgot to send it.

00:13:57.629 --> 00:13:59.629
I can't believe I missed that.

00:13:59.629 --> 00:14:00.629
It's okay.

00:14:00.629 --> 00:14:01.629
I'm worried about it.

00:14:01.629 --> 00:14:02.629
It's not.

00:14:02.629 --> 00:14:03.629
You needed those things, Gabe.

00:14:03.629 --> 00:14:06.419
No, Max.

00:14:06.419 --> 00:14:16.259
I mean, everybody forgets.

00:14:16.259 --> 00:14:17.259
Thanks, Gabe.

00:14:17.259 --> 00:14:18.259
I'll get right on it.

00:14:18.259 --> 00:14:20.259
I gotta make a phone call.

00:14:20.259 --> 00:14:21.259
Okay.

00:14:21.259 --> 00:14:30.309
Things are getting pretty busy around here.

00:14:30.309 --> 00:14:32.309
I'm sorry about the mix up.

00:14:32.309 --> 00:14:33.309
It's okay, Wayne.

00:14:33.309 --> 00:14:35.309
We all forget things sometimes.

00:14:35.309 --> 00:14:46.809
You know, I want to apologize myself.

00:14:46.809 --> 00:14:48.809
I didn't mean to lose my patience.

00:14:48.809 --> 00:14:50.809
I shouldn't have reacted like that at the Kingdom Hall.

00:14:50.809 --> 00:14:54.470
I'm sorry.

00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:56.470
You know, when I first got this assignment,

00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:58.470
I made some mistakes myself.

00:14:58.470 --> 00:14:59.470
Really?

00:14:59.470 --> 00:15:01.470
Yeah, I really did.

00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:03.470
So I'll hide in schedule too soon.
