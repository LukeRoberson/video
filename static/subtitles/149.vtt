00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:06.879
In the book, inside on the Scriptures, under the heading Christian, it makes clear that

00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:12.560
claiming to be Christian requires more than simply a mere confession of faith.

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:17.879
It is more than being a nominal Christian, a Christian in name only.

00:00:17.879 --> 00:00:23.359
For example, according to the Bible, it is necessary that belief be demonstrated by

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:25.960
works, not just words.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:31.920
And since we were born as sinners, those who become Christians need to repent, to turn

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:38.920
around, to dedicate their lives to Jehovah, to worship and serve Him, and then to submit

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.920
to water baptism.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:47.479
They must keep themselves clean from fornication, from idolatry, and from consuming blood.

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:53.840
They are to strip off the old personality, including such things as fits of anger, obscene

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.159
talk, lying, stealing, drunkenness.

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:04.959
And as Galatians chapter 5 says, things like these, yes they are to bring their lives into

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:08.239
a court with Bible principles.

00:01:08.239 --> 00:01:13.799
Christians are to be kind and considerate, mild tempered and patient, and are to exercise

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.599
self-control.

00:01:15.599 --> 00:01:21.439
They provide and care for their own and love their neighbor as themselves.

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:23.920
What's a loss, isn't it?

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:29.760
It's not a matter of just glibly saying, I am a Christian.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:37.120
But despite all of those impressive characteristics that we just enumerated, what did Jesus say

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:43.120
the main identifying quality of a true Christian would be?

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.480
Most of you know the answer to that.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:52.840
But let's read it again from John 13, 34, and 35.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:58.519
It says, I am giving you a new commandment that you love one another, just as I have loved

00:01:58.519 --> 00:01:59.680
you.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.239
You also love one another.

00:02:02.239 --> 00:02:11.400
By this all will know that you are my disciples, if you have love among yourselves.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.199
Those are the theme verses for my discussion with you this month.

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:22.800
The topic is love, the identifying mark of a disciple of Jesus.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:31.360
Did you notice in verse 34 that Jesus said that he was giving them at that time a new commandment?

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.680
But it sounds like a very old commandment doesn't it?

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:41.080
Why over 1,500 years before Jesus said that the words we just read, the law given to Moses

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:49.000
said, you must love your fellow man as yourself, Leviticus 19, 18.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.120
So what was new about Jesus' command in John chapter 13?

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:02.960
He said that true Christians were to love each other just as I have loved you.

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.639
That is what was different.

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:07.520
That was new.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:14.599
Not just love the other person as you love yourself, but love him just like Jesus loved

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:17.000
his followers.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.039
Well what kind of love would that be?

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:22.479
Self-sacrificing love.

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:29.439
And usually we think of Jesus' ultimate sacrifice, his willingly giving his life so that we

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:33.360
might have the hope of everlasting life.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:39.280
But when you think about it, that aspect of Jesus' love was simplified and a self-sacrificing

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.080
death.

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:46.560
Now it's true that as a Christian we might, at some time, have to give our life for

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.240
a fellow Christian, but we hope it doesn't come to that.

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:58.120
So instead of talking about a self-sacrificing death, we want to discuss showing this new kind

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:03.319
of love as evidenced in a self-sacrificing life.

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:05.800
None necessarily are dead.

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:13.919
You see, Jesus' life, his three and a half year ministry, was a self-sacrificing life

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:16.040
of loving others.

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:24.240
In addition to doing good when something requires it, a true follower of Jesus is to take the

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:29.319
initiative to help others spiritually and otherwise.

00:04:29.319 --> 00:04:32.639
He has to work actively for their good.

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:36.079
They preaching and teaching are the good news to others.

00:04:36.079 --> 00:04:43.019
Some of whom may even be hostile is one of the greatest expressions of love, for it can

00:04:43.019 --> 00:04:46.319
result in everlasting life to the recipients.

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:53.600
However, according to Paul's words at First Thessalonians 2, verse 8, a true Christian

00:04:53.600 --> 00:05:02.439
must impart not only the good news of God, but also his very self in helping those who

00:05:02.439 --> 00:05:04.759
accept the good news.

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:11.600
It's that kind of love that Jesus said would be an identifying mark of his disciples,

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:19.079
not specifically that his followers would all be dying for each other, but more so that

00:05:19.079 --> 00:05:23.399
they would all be living for each other.

00:05:23.399 --> 00:05:29.639
Yes, displaying self-sacrificing love for one another every day of their lives.

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:36.000
The four gospels are a treasure trove of Jesus' self-sacrificing love, and yet they do

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.519
not cover his actions every day of his life as the Christ.

00:05:41.519 --> 00:05:48.759
History in a half-year ministry amounts to nearly 1,300 days of life and love.

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:55.199
The written record of Jesus' life is admittedly brief, but it is grand indeed.

00:05:55.759 --> 00:06:02.199
However, the reality of observing Jesus every day must have been far grander than what

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:04.160
we have in print.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:12.160
What we have in print might be likened to a photo album of Jesus' life, some snap shots.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:20.639
By comparison, what his apostles' experience with Jesus' day after day was like a continuous

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:24.399
video of his example of love.

00:06:24.399 --> 00:06:31.120
No wonder that at John, chapter 21, verse 25, the apostle said,

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:38.040
there are also many other things that Jesus did, which if ever they were written in full

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:45.399
detail, I suppose the world itself could not contain the scrolls written.

00:06:45.399 --> 00:06:48.879
It said there were many other things.

00:06:48.959 --> 00:06:56.319
Jesus did, not many other things that he said, but that he did.

00:06:56.319 --> 00:07:02.240
Yes, deeds or acts, demonstrating his self-sacrificing life of love.

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:08.480
We already mentioned the all-important preaching work as being an act of love on our part,

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:14.839
but how else do we manifest the most obvious trait of a genuine Christian?

00:07:14.839 --> 00:07:18.519
Love like Jesus had.

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:22.839
Let's start by thinking of the elders and the congregation.

00:07:22.839 --> 00:07:29.319
At the Philippians, chapter 2, verse 17, Paul said that he had poured himself out to

00:07:29.319 --> 00:07:33.199
the congregation like a drink offering.

00:07:33.199 --> 00:07:34.800
What did that mean?

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:40.399
It meant that he drained himself out, both physically and emotionally, to support the

00:07:40.399 --> 00:07:42.199
Philippians.

00:07:42.199 --> 00:07:47.319
Many of the elders in our congregations have the same self-sacrificing love for those

00:07:47.319 --> 00:07:49.000
under their care.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.680
They give of their time to shepherd and readjust those in need.

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:56.319
They take the lead in the ministry.

00:07:56.319 --> 00:08:00.199
They respond when there is a serious health issue or tragedy.

00:08:00.199 --> 00:08:06.319
They pour themselves out for the friends, thus identifying themselves as disciples of

00:08:06.319 --> 00:08:07.800
Christ.

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:13.800
But we do not have to be an elder to provide a word of encouragement to do it.

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:21.639
If we all keep focused on others in the congregation, not just ourselves, we will know who needs

00:08:21.639 --> 00:08:27.279
to be bolstered because of trials or circumstances that they face.

00:08:27.279 --> 00:08:31.800
Giving in this way is evidence of Christ's like love.

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:37.600
You may be thinking, but I am just a little old sister who finds it hard to squeeze out

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:40.799
a word of encouragement to others.

00:08:40.799 --> 00:08:44.639
Perhaps you do not have to say anything.

00:08:44.639 --> 00:08:49.759
Just be there at the meetings or in the service.

00:08:49.759 --> 00:08:53.080
When others see your face, they are encouraged.

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:58.519
Follow along as I read Acts chapter 28 and verse 15.

00:08:58.519 --> 00:09:04.399
It reads, from there, the brothers when they heard the news about us came as far as the

00:09:04.399 --> 00:09:09.159
marketplace of apias and three taverns to meet us.

00:09:09.159 --> 00:09:17.519
When catching sight of them, Paul thanked God and took courage.

00:09:17.519 --> 00:09:25.669
Paul took courage just by seeing the brothers who came out to meeting.

00:09:25.669 --> 00:09:30.669
You encourage your brothers and sisters by your presence.

00:09:30.669 --> 00:09:36.950
Please follow along as I read Philippians chapter 2, 1 through 4.

00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:41.509
Paul here describes it as encouragement in Christ.

00:09:41.509 --> 00:09:47.029
He says, if then there is any encouragement in Christ.

00:09:47.029 --> 00:09:55.950
If any consolation of love, if any spiritual fellowship, if any tender affection and compassion

00:09:55.950 --> 00:10:03.429
make my joy full by being of the same mind and having the same love, being completely

00:10:03.429 --> 00:10:09.750
united, having the one thought in mind, do nothing out of contentiousness or out of

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:13.429
egotism but with humility.

00:10:13.429 --> 00:10:20.950
Consider others superior to you as you look out not only for your own interests but also

00:10:20.950 --> 00:10:24.830
for the interests of others.

00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:29.909
Did you notice the self-sacrificing aspect of this love and encouragement?

00:10:29.909 --> 00:10:32.590
Yes, he talked about having love.

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:39.350
But then he said, not for your own interests but for the interests of others.

00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:46.830
That type of love in the interests of others is the identifying mark of true Christians.

00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:52.929
What about visiting the sick in your congregation or those who are housebound?

00:10:52.929 --> 00:10:57.070
Sometimes these dear ones are out of sight, out of mind.

00:10:57.070 --> 00:11:04.029
We visit with those we see when at the kingdom hall but do we think about those who are shut

00:11:04.029 --> 00:11:06.029
in?

00:11:06.029 --> 00:11:10.629
What was a major part of Jesus' loving acts went on earth?

00:11:10.629 --> 00:11:14.669
Our numerous accounts of Jesus and His apostles healing the sick.

00:11:14.669 --> 00:11:24.070
It's true that we cannot heal the sick but it is in our power to visit the sick.

00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:26.830
And what a healing that is to their spirit.

00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:34.950
It means so much when they are not just prayed for at a meeting but when those words of prayer

00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:42.590
are backed up with an act of love, a visit to them in person, that is Christ-like love

00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:45.470
in action.

00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:50.429
Why not scroll down the list of those in your service group with the thought and mind

00:11:50.429 --> 00:11:55.389
of checking on those who have been missing from the meetings?

00:11:55.389 --> 00:11:57.389
Do they need a meal?

00:11:57.389 --> 00:11:59.669
Do they need some help?

00:11:59.669 --> 00:12:01.309
Perhaps around the house?

00:12:01.309 --> 00:12:05.429
Do they need transportation to the doctor?

00:12:05.429 --> 00:12:10.350
Can we allow our love to expand to fill their needs?

00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:14.210
Contributing to the worldwide work which cares for the needs of our brothers around the

00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:17.389
world is another act of love.

00:12:17.389 --> 00:12:22.230
It demonstrates that we are a true disciple of Christ.

00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:30.230
Many of you have at your own expense traveled to far-flung places to help rebuild after

00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:32.830
a natural disaster has struck.

00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:39.110
The overwhelming response from the victims is evidence of your self-sacrificing life and

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:41.830
love for your brothers.

00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:49.230
It's hoped that the reminder of Jesus at John 1334 and 35 will be good for all of us,

00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:55.549
not just for this month, but for our whole course of life.

00:12:55.549 --> 00:13:00.830
You know, about one-third of the world's population claims to be Christian.

00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:08.029
But how many of them show self-sacrificing love outside of their immediate family?

00:13:08.029 --> 00:13:11.669
Most are like a baseball team in a uniform.

00:13:11.669 --> 00:13:17.549
They think having the word Christian emblazoned across the front of their uniform is all that

00:13:17.549 --> 00:13:18.549
is required.

00:13:18.549 --> 00:13:25.789
However, most of them simply sit on the bench or on a pew in church.

00:13:25.789 --> 00:13:29.269
And many do not even attend the game.

00:13:29.269 --> 00:13:32.629
They do not live the life of a Christian.

00:13:32.629 --> 00:13:40.230
Jesus made clear that being a true disciple of his is not merely wearing a uniform.

00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:42.669
Simply claiming to be his follower.

00:13:42.669 --> 00:13:51.789
No, it involves actively demonstrating works of love, swinging hard for the team, imitating

00:13:51.789 --> 00:13:59.429
the all-time greatest examples of love, Jehovah God and His Son, Jesus Christ.

00:13:59.429 --> 00:14:06.909
As Paul said at 2 Corinthians chapter 8, first aid, we need to test the genuineness

00:14:06.909 --> 00:14:08.149
of our love.

00:14:08.149 --> 00:14:14.029
Yes, we need to daily prove that we are a genuine disciple of Jesus.
