WEBVTT

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.960
Good day, brothers and sisters.

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.960
We will begin this convention session

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.960
by enjoying another music video presentation.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.960
This video highlights the power that faith can have in our lives.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.960
Please enjoy the video.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:10:36.250
Our opening song expresses our joy and practicing true worship.

00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:42.250
Let's sing song number 24 entitled Come to Jehovah's Mountain.

00:10:42.250 --> 00:13:27.460
That song number 24.

00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:30.460
Genuine faith moves us to action.

00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:34.460
This could be seen in the lives of our brothers and sisters Earthwide.

00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:41.460
Please enjoy the following video that features experiences from six different regions.

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:44.460
Let's see how our brothers are showing faith.

00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:56.539
They defeated kingdoms.

00:13:56.539 --> 00:13:59.539
Brought about righteousness.

00:13:59.539 --> 00:14:01.539
Obtained promises.

00:14:01.539 --> 00:14:04.539
Stopped the mouths of lions.

00:14:04.539 --> 00:14:07.539
Quenched the force of fire.

00:14:07.539 --> 00:14:10.539
Escaped the edge of the sword.

00:14:10.539 --> 00:14:13.539
From a weak state were made powerful.

00:14:13.539 --> 00:14:19.539
Became mighty in war, routed invading armies.

00:14:19.539 --> 00:14:26.539
Faith in Jehovah has allowed ordinary people to do extraordinary things.

00:14:26.539 --> 00:14:30.539
This kind of faith is still active today

00:14:30.539 --> 00:14:35.539
and still has the power to help us through any difficulty.

00:14:35.539 --> 00:14:38.539
So let's travel across the globe

00:14:38.539 --> 00:14:46.539
and see how deep reliance on Jehovah has helped many overcome their unique trials.

00:14:46.539 --> 00:14:52.539
As we visit each land, we'll enjoy a story of faith

00:14:52.539 --> 00:14:59.539
shared both from the perspective of close friends as well as the individuals involved.

00:14:59.539 --> 00:15:09.750
Now to our first destination.

00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:15.750
South Africa is full of contrasts and diversity.

00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:19.750
Big modern cities mix with poorer remote areas.

00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:22.750
For many volunteers in Kingdom Hall construction,

00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:25.750
this presents wonderful opportunities

00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:29.750
but also unique challenges that require faith in Jehovah.

00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:33.750
An example of that is our young friend, Nathla.

00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:39.750
My wife and I really appreciated the faith she showed to make herself available

00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:42.750
and to keep her joy in her assignment.

00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:47.750
I'm the only Jehovah's Witness in my family.

00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:52.750
What my mother desired the most for me was to grow up,

00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:58.750
go to college, and in time, get a high-paying job.

00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:04.029
My congregation was busy building a Kingdom Hall.

00:16:04.029 --> 00:16:07.029
So I would sometimes also go to help.

00:16:07.029 --> 00:16:14.500
I wanted to see and feel the joy that those brothers were having building Kingdom Halls.

00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:20.500
My mom didn't like it when she heard that I was going to help with Kingdom Hall construction.

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:24.500
She felt that I was wasting my time.

00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:30.980
When I arrived on site, everything I did was for the first time.

00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:35.980
I didn't have skills and I had never done this work before.

00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:37.980
It is not easy.

00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:43.980
Sometimes I get tired, mentally exhausted, and even physically exhausted.

00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:46.980
Sometimes it's difficult to even read the Bible.

00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:52.980
I just want to wash up and go to sleep.

00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:57.980
It was important for Nathla to find her spiritual balance

00:16:57.980 --> 00:17:04.980
because her spirituality was more important than working hard on site.

00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:08.980
I realized that I needed to be really determined

00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:12.980
because my spirituality was not the same as before.

00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:16.980
I saw that I needed to make a change.

00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:20.980
I made it a priority to read the Bible first

00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:23.980
and to think about the things I read.

00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:30.829
I also made sure that I was regular in going out in the ministry.

00:17:30.829 --> 00:17:37.829
Prayer helped a lot because prayer is the best way for me to tell Jehovah things that concern me.

00:17:37.829 --> 00:17:42.829
I have seen from myself how Jehovah God has sustained me.

00:17:42.829 --> 00:17:47.829
We've seen that she is much more balanced.

00:17:47.829 --> 00:17:52.829
My mom would phone and ask, Nathla, how is the project going?

00:17:52.829 --> 00:17:58.829
And then she would say, if this makes you happy, then I am also happy.

00:17:58.829 --> 00:18:02.829
At first, I had my fears, but faith made me confident

00:18:02.829 --> 00:18:08.829
that Jehovah God would always be there to support me in everything I do.

00:18:08.829 --> 00:18:32.220
Canada is a diverse country, both the landscape

00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:36.220
and because of immigration, the people in their languages.

00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:39.220
In order to share Bible truth with these ones,

00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:44.220
many brothers are learning a new language like my friend Shaquille.

00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:52.619
When Shaquille got invited to Bethel, I had the privilege of serving at Canada branch at the time.

00:18:52.619 --> 00:18:56.619
So it was such a pleasure to see this young man who had all these wonderful goals

00:18:56.619 --> 00:19:00.619
and to see one by one Jehovah opening those doors to him.

00:19:00.619 --> 00:19:04.619
He had made a promise to Jehovah as a young person.

00:19:04.619 --> 00:19:10.619
I want to help those that don't have anyone to help them.

00:19:10.619 --> 00:19:14.619
Jehovah saw good in me and he invested in me and he was very patient with me

00:19:14.619 --> 00:19:18.619
and I saw it through every brother and sister who sincerely reached out to help me.

00:19:18.619 --> 00:19:22.619
I'm meditating on Jehovah's qualities and you want to imitate him.

00:19:22.619 --> 00:19:25.619
You want to show the kindness that he's shown towards you towards others.

00:19:25.619 --> 00:19:29.619
So in foreign language, I feel like there's a giant opportunity to do that.

00:19:29.619 --> 00:19:32.619
I started to learn Punjabi and I never regretted it.

00:19:32.619 --> 00:19:35.619
It changed my service to Jehovah.

00:19:35.619 --> 00:19:45.430
There was a time period in my Bethel service when I was really, really sick

00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:49.430
and it was a kind of sickness where I didn't know why it was happening.

00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:52.430
No doctor could tell me why it was happening.

00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:58.430
It affected my physical appearance and it seemed like torment throughout each and every day.

00:19:58.430 --> 00:20:03.430
A lot of times I would have rather not been seen.

00:20:03.430 --> 00:20:07.430
So serving in foreign language now when you're one of the people who spiritually

00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:11.430
supposed to be strengthening others, you're going through a hard time yourself.

00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:14.430
That was a massive challenge for me.

00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:21.430
I think all of his friends just really appreciated the faith that he had to overcome that

00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:27.430
and even though it was a very low point in his life, he really hung on to Jehovah.

00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:31.430
If I'm in this assignment and I've seen that Jehovah's bless me,

00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:35.430
what would lead me to conclude that he's going to stop?

00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:40.430
He couldn't sleep. He just couldn't continue at Bethel either.

00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:44.430
I had left Bethel but still my health was decreasing and it was getting really bad.

00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:48.430
And it was getting to the point that doctors expressed concern about maybe

00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:51.430
an organ failing and things like that.

00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:55.430
But they did not give me any way out. I had no way out.

00:20:55.430 --> 00:21:01.430
He kept making progress even though there was certainly some really difficult times for him.

00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:05.430
I had to take a realistic approach towards my new situation

00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:10.430
and I had to figure out how am I going to put Kingdom interest first

00:21:10.430 --> 00:21:17.430
while materially taking care of myself and hopefully figuring out why I'm sick

00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:20.430
and if I can do anything about it.

00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:25.430
In the end he decided to stick with foreign language

00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:31.430
and something I really learned from Shaquille is that he really took the scriptures

00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:37.430
and made it personal. He would read it as if he was the person in the scriptures

00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:43.430
and he would meditate on it and now he could see how even though he didn't know the answers

00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:47.430
Jehovah would help him through his difficult times.

00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:52.430
So what am I going to do? I'm going to live up to what I promised to Jehovah.

00:21:52.430 --> 00:21:56.430
Today he serves with his wife in the Punjabi field.

00:21:56.430 --> 00:22:01.430
He's a loving shepherd and he even instructs Punjabi language classes.

00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:26.009
In Indonesia people work very hard.

00:22:26.009 --> 00:22:29.009
They seek stability through a secure job.

00:22:29.009 --> 00:22:33.009
This can have a powerful influence on the brothers and sisters

00:22:33.009 --> 00:22:37.009
because they may feel that they can't expand their ministry.

00:22:37.009 --> 00:22:42.009
When I met the Japanese girls they were working toward Pioneer service.

00:22:42.009 --> 00:22:45.009
When they started I asked them,

00:22:45.009 --> 00:22:49.009
would you like to be used more fully by Jehovah?

00:22:49.009 --> 00:22:52.009
I was confused.

00:22:52.009 --> 00:22:58.009
We felt that the Pioneer service itself was already a big accomplishment.

00:22:58.009 --> 00:23:03.009
I encouraged them to think about the school for Kingdom Evangelizers.

00:23:03.009 --> 00:23:08.009
I had never imagined applying for SKE.

00:23:08.009 --> 00:23:10.009
It was tempting.

00:23:10.009 --> 00:23:13.009
I wanted to be used by Jehovah,

00:23:13.009 --> 00:23:18.009
but what would happen to us after graduation?

00:23:18.009 --> 00:23:22.289
Where would we be assigned?

00:23:22.289 --> 00:23:26.599
What would be our assignment?

00:23:26.599 --> 00:23:30.680
We needed more faith,

00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:33.680
so we prayed a lot about that.

00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:38.680
Jehovah answered my prayers through the brothers and sisters in the congregation.

00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:43.119
Marta had a prestigious job.

00:23:43.119 --> 00:23:48.119
She was even being offered many scholarships so that she could pursue higher education

00:23:48.119 --> 00:23:51.119
and further advance her career.

00:23:51.119 --> 00:23:56.119
The brothers and sisters never criticized Marta's work choice.

00:23:56.119 --> 00:24:02.119
Rather they showed us the joys of serving Jehovah more fully.

00:24:02.119 --> 00:24:05.119
When I was still deciding what to do,

00:24:05.119 --> 00:24:08.119
some of them asked me about my spiritual goals,

00:24:08.119 --> 00:24:11.119
and what I could see myself doing,

00:24:11.119 --> 00:24:14.119
thinking about such questions,

00:24:14.119 --> 00:24:19.589
convinced me to choose SKE.

00:24:19.589 --> 00:24:22.589
They were invited to attend the school.

00:24:22.589 --> 00:24:25.589
They had to leave their jobs, their house,

00:24:25.589 --> 00:24:28.589
and the comforts of the place and city where they lived.

00:24:28.589 --> 00:24:31.589
They were assigned to a small congregation.

00:24:31.589 --> 00:24:38.589
They had to pray even more to ask Jehovah God for guidance and direction.

00:24:38.589 --> 00:24:44.589
Now they're serving in the traveling work, caring for a certain.

00:24:44.589 --> 00:24:49.589
We are fully convinced that it was not due to any greatness on our part,

00:24:49.589 --> 00:24:53.589
but because of Jehovah's help.

00:24:53.589 --> 00:24:56.589
If we want to be used by Jehovah,

00:24:56.589 --> 00:24:59.589
and if we want to serve him,

00:24:59.589 --> 00:25:03.589
Jehovah can use us in many different ways.

00:25:03.589 --> 00:25:26.569
BG is a beautiful place.

00:25:26.569 --> 00:25:34.200
However, one thing that is common here is poverty.

00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:40.200
That is the situation sister Baccata faces.

00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:45.930
My husband was a hard worker.

00:25:45.930 --> 00:25:47.930
While we were out in the water,

00:25:47.930 --> 00:25:50.930
he cried out from the mangroves.

00:25:50.930 --> 00:25:53.930
When I went and found him,

00:25:53.930 --> 00:25:58.930
I knew that it was a stroke.

00:25:58.930 --> 00:26:03.930
I had to take on both roles as husband and wife.

00:26:03.930 --> 00:26:05.930
I would farm.

00:26:05.930 --> 00:26:07.930
I would fish.

00:26:07.930 --> 00:26:10.930
It was a difficult life.

00:26:10.930 --> 00:26:18.640
One day, a sister was sick.

00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:22.640
Even though sister Baccata faced challenges,

00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:27.640
if there was any washing or cleaning needed for the sick sister,

00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:34.809
she was happy to go and help with that too.

00:26:34.809 --> 00:26:42.779
I think back to when a cyclone hit Kadavu, cyclone Kenny.

00:26:42.779 --> 00:26:46.779
I was scared by the damage it did to our house.

00:26:46.779 --> 00:26:50.779
Our outdoor kitchen was blown off.

00:26:50.779 --> 00:26:54.779
When I heard about the things that happened to the brothers,

00:26:54.779 --> 00:26:57.779
I felt so sorry for them.

00:26:57.779 --> 00:27:02.059
Their roofs were blown away,

00:27:02.059 --> 00:27:04.059
and the walls had fallen down.

00:27:04.059 --> 00:27:12.039
Just think about what sister Baccata did.

00:27:12.039 --> 00:27:16.349
She had 20 Fiji and dollars.

00:27:16.349 --> 00:27:19.349
That is the only money she had.

00:27:19.349 --> 00:27:25.779
But she decided to give all of that to the brothers.

00:27:25.779 --> 00:27:33.630
I didn't have any other way to help them.

00:27:33.630 --> 00:27:36.630
Jehovah is the God of love.

00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:39.630
Like it says at first on four and eight,

00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:42.630
his main quality is love.

00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:44.630
Because of that love,

00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:49.740
I gave the money from the bottom of my heart.

00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:53.740
I learned that even though we are poor,

00:27:53.740 --> 00:27:59.920
we can still be generous to sister brothers.

00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:01.920
The more I gave,

00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:05.920
the more Jehovah gave back to me.

00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:07.920
Till today,

00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:10.920
we've always had what we've needed.

00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:34.039
And through,

00:28:34.039 --> 00:28:36.039
like many places around the world,

00:28:36.039 --> 00:28:39.039
our brothers and sisters need to work hard.

00:28:39.039 --> 00:28:48.259
Benjamin and Doris have to make good use of their resources

00:28:48.259 --> 00:28:51.259
in order to provide for their family.

00:28:51.259 --> 00:28:57.079
We want to give our children a spiritual heritage.

00:28:57.079 --> 00:28:59.079
We want them to be able to serve Jehovah

00:28:59.079 --> 00:29:01.079
by watching how we are doing it.

00:29:01.079 --> 00:29:05.579
We watch a lot of videos that help us.

00:29:05.579 --> 00:29:09.579
We often remember the video about Abilio Anula.

00:29:09.579 --> 00:29:11.579
They also had three children.

00:29:11.579 --> 00:29:13.579
They moved to another place

00:29:13.579 --> 00:29:17.579
and grew up in a very nice spiritual atmosphere.

00:29:17.579 --> 00:29:19.579
They are serving Jehovah now as adults.

00:29:19.579 --> 00:29:23.250
So we asked ourselves,

00:29:23.250 --> 00:29:26.250
could we move to another place where the need is great?

00:29:26.250 --> 00:29:31.619
It takes faith to go to an unfamiliar place.

00:29:31.619 --> 00:29:35.619
When video on JW.org that helped us a lot

00:29:35.619 --> 00:29:38.619
was about the family from England that moved to Ecuador.

00:29:38.619 --> 00:29:40.619
First, they went for one month.

00:29:40.619 --> 00:29:43.619
So we said that we should also go as a first.

00:29:43.619 --> 00:29:46.619
Going to another country would have been exciting.

00:29:46.619 --> 00:29:48.619
It would have been super.

00:29:48.619 --> 00:29:54.619
But our economic situation wouldn't allow us to go that far.

00:29:54.619 --> 00:29:56.619
We took a trip together with our children

00:29:56.619 --> 00:30:00.619
to visit a territory that had a need, called Kalango.

00:30:00.619 --> 00:30:04.619
It takes about an hour and a half to get there.

00:30:04.619 --> 00:30:08.619
They liked the geography of the area in all the vegetation.

00:30:08.619 --> 00:30:11.619
There were many things that captured their attention.

00:30:11.619 --> 00:30:16.619
The things that I like in Kalango are playing and preaching.

00:30:16.619 --> 00:30:23.470
We were unable to move to the city of Kalango

00:30:23.470 --> 00:30:27.470
because of the economic situation that the people face there.

00:30:27.470 --> 00:30:29.470
It's hard to get a job there.

00:30:29.470 --> 00:30:31.470
So for that reason,

00:30:31.470 --> 00:30:36.470
we decided to travel to Kalango Friday, Saturday and Sunday.

00:30:36.470 --> 00:30:39.470
And work the other days here in Pachakamak.

00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:43.470
We have felt that Jehovah is helping us

00:30:43.470 --> 00:30:46.470
because he has made it possible to work here

00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:49.470
and the money that we earn in those days

00:30:49.470 --> 00:30:53.470
allows us to be with our brothers there.

00:30:53.470 --> 00:30:56.470
We needed to know how to keep things simple.

00:30:56.470 --> 00:31:00.470
We learned that from the videos on JW.org.

00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:03.470
The hard work that they do proves to me

00:31:03.470 --> 00:31:05.470
that they really love Jehovah.

00:31:05.470 --> 00:31:09.470
They fully trust that Jehovah is our father.

00:31:09.470 --> 00:31:10.470
He is the dad.

00:31:10.470 --> 00:31:14.470
And we know that dad always comes through for his children.

00:31:14.470 --> 00:31:18.470
And that faith is something that greatly motivates them.

00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:22.470
The videos on JW.org have given us the push that we needed.

00:31:22.470 --> 00:31:26.720
We needed those videos in order to take action

00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:29.720
and move to another area.

00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:49.160
Across Russia,

00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:55.160
our brothers have successfully faced decades of persecution and ban.

00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:59.160
The budden chucks, like so many families there,

00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:03.160
still face these challenges today.

00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:08.160
On June 12, 2018, at 5.30 a.m.,

00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:12.160
armed men burst into our home.

00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:18.660
They threw my husband to the floor and handcuffed him.

00:32:19.660 --> 00:32:21.660
Eventually, they sent my husband

00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:25.660
to a pretrial detention facility for 11 months.

00:32:25.660 --> 00:32:29.660
It was frightening just imagining certain things.

00:32:29.660 --> 00:32:33.660
She didn't find it easy and shed many tears.

00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:37.660
I was really worried about how I would care for the children

00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:42.660
and how I would fulfill their needs spiritually, emotionally, and physically.

00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:46.099
Prayer calmed me down.

00:32:47.099 --> 00:32:52.099
Because I wanted, of course, to react very emotionally to everything

00:32:52.099 --> 00:32:55.099
to the injustice that we were facing.

00:32:55.099 --> 00:32:58.099
When the court hearings were going on,

00:32:58.099 --> 00:33:00.099
brothers and sisters would come.

00:33:00.099 --> 00:33:08.009
It was such a support, so strengthening.

00:33:08.009 --> 00:33:11.009
On September 19, 2019,

00:33:11.009 --> 00:33:15.009
the court convicted my husband

00:33:15.009 --> 00:33:19.009
and sent him to a prison colony for three and a half years.

00:33:19.009 --> 00:33:28.180
In January 2020, a new disaster hit us.

00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:33.180
At 1 a.m., our house burned to the ground.

00:33:33.180 --> 00:33:37.180
We stood there near the house,

00:33:37.180 --> 00:33:42.180
and my son Igor suggested saying a prayer.

00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:47.180
I don't remember the prayer, but afterwards I felt calmer.

00:33:47.180 --> 00:33:50.180
Then cars started coming to the house.

00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:55.180
Our brothers and sisters, I was frozen, shaking from the cold.

00:33:55.180 --> 00:33:59.180
They dressed me like a small child.

00:33:59.180 --> 00:34:13.010
They brought us hot tea, food, everything of the highest quality.

00:34:13.010 --> 00:34:19.300
Just one month after the fire,

00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:22.300
when they took my husband to the prison colony,

00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:24.300
officers there beat him up.

00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:33.780
When I found out about it, it was so hard for me

00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:35.780
because I didn't know how to help my husband

00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:37.780
or how he was feeling.

00:34:37.780 --> 00:34:45.329
Tanya copes with hardships very courageously.

00:34:45.329 --> 00:34:49.329
I prayed to Jehovah sometimes all night.

00:34:49.329 --> 00:34:55.329
It felt as though Jehovah gave me pain killers to dull my pain.

00:34:55.329 --> 00:34:59.329
My husband, Alexey, tries to take care of us.

00:34:59.329 --> 00:35:02.329
In the pre-trial detention facility, for example,

00:35:02.329 --> 00:35:05.329
each day he wrote letters of encouragement to us,

00:35:05.329 --> 00:35:07.329
which we read together as a family.

00:35:07.329 --> 00:35:11.329
My dear family, remember the qualities that we need right now,

00:35:11.329 --> 00:35:17.329
endurance, courage, calmness, and most importantly, faith.

00:35:17.329 --> 00:35:21.329
I like the thought that after winter, summer always comes.

00:35:21.329 --> 00:35:24.329
After the night, the day arrives,

00:35:24.329 --> 00:35:26.329
and after the darkest days,

00:35:26.329 --> 00:35:30.329
there will definitely come a sunny one.

00:35:30.329 --> 00:35:32.329
Throughout all these trials,

00:35:32.329 --> 00:35:34.329
having a good spiritual schedule

00:35:34.329 --> 00:35:37.329
and reading the Bible has given me strength.

00:35:37.329 --> 00:35:42.329
Also, we prepare for meetings and participate in the ministry.

00:35:42.329 --> 00:35:45.329
I was really afraid to do it.

00:35:45.329 --> 00:35:50.329
But this situation has helped me to see Jehovah's support.

00:35:50.329 --> 00:35:53.329
I have realized that even in my circumstances,

00:35:53.329 --> 00:35:55.329
I can still help others.

00:35:55.329 --> 00:35:59.329
We know that Jehovah has already given us his support

00:35:59.329 --> 00:36:03.329
and we believe that he will continue to support us.

00:36:03.329 --> 00:36:06.329
Their example of courage and steadfast faith

00:36:06.329 --> 00:36:09.329
in the face of difficulties and trials

00:36:09.329 --> 00:36:11.329
proves that we can also remain faithful.

00:36:11.329 --> 00:36:13.329
We too can make Jehovah happy

00:36:13.329 --> 00:36:16.329
and continue to serve him without becoming discouraged.

00:36:16.329 --> 00:36:19.329
We have learned to trust more in Jehovah

00:36:19.329 --> 00:36:23.329
and not to panic when a difficult situation arises.

00:36:23.329 --> 00:36:26.329
These difficulties have made me stronger,

00:36:26.329 --> 00:36:29.329
helped me to overcome many of the fears I used to have,

00:36:29.329 --> 00:36:34.329
and strengthened my faith and my desire to help others.

00:36:34.329 --> 00:36:41.900
As we have seen,

00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:43.900
our brothers, the world,

00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:47.900
over continued to show strong faith.

00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:54.440
How did they do it?

00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:57.440
A regular study of God's Word,

00:36:57.440 --> 00:37:02.360
time spent in deep meditation,

00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:07.360
and seeking His direction in prayer.

00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:10.360
What did this allow them to accomplish?

00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:12.360
Through faith,

00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:15.360
our brothers handled theocratic building assignments,

00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:17.360
learned foreign languages,

00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:20.360
attended theocratic schools.

00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:23.360
Though poor, remain generous,

00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:26.360
served where the need was great,

00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:30.360
and preached despite persecution.

00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:34.360
And Jehovah knows we can do the same.

00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:39.360
Yes, if we let faith move us to action,

00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:43.360
those actions will strengthen our faith.

00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:52.289
Those experiences warm our hearts and move us

00:37:52.289 --> 00:37:55.289
to imitate the faith of our brothers and sisters.

00:37:55.289 --> 00:37:58.289
What are some ways in which we can do so?

00:37:58.289 --> 00:38:02.289
The following symposium will discuss five opportunities

00:38:02.289 --> 00:38:04.289
to show our faith,

00:38:04.289 --> 00:38:07.289
and it will help us to overcome obstacles

00:38:07.289 --> 00:38:09.289
that could hold us back.

00:38:09.289 --> 00:38:13.289
Each speaker will introduce the one to follow.

00:38:13.289 --> 00:38:15.289
Brother David Schaeffer,

00:38:15.289 --> 00:38:17.289
a helper to the teaching committee,

00:38:17.289 --> 00:38:20.289
will present the first talk entitled,

00:38:20.289 --> 00:38:23.289
Enter the Door to Activity in Faith,

00:38:23.289 --> 00:38:25.289
Learn a New Language.

00:38:25.289 --> 00:38:34.909
Can you see faith?

00:38:34.909 --> 00:38:37.909
Turn with me please to Mark 2,

00:38:37.909 --> 00:38:40.909
and notice what the Bible says about this.

00:38:40.909 --> 00:38:42.909
In this account, Jesus is teaching

00:38:42.909 --> 00:38:44.909
in a crowded house in Copernium,

00:38:44.909 --> 00:38:48.909
and Mark 2, 2 through 5, tells us,

00:38:48.909 --> 00:38:52.909
and so many gathered that there was no more room,

00:38:52.909 --> 00:38:54.909
not even around the door,

00:38:54.909 --> 00:38:57.909
and he began to speak the word to them.

00:38:57.909 --> 00:39:00.909
And they brought him a paralytic carried by four men,

00:39:00.909 --> 00:39:03.909
but they could not bring him right to Jesus

00:39:03.909 --> 00:39:05.909
because of the crowd.

00:39:05.909 --> 00:39:10.909
So they removed the roof above Jesus.

00:39:10.909 --> 00:39:12.909
And after digging and opening,

00:39:12.909 --> 00:39:16.909
they lowered the stretcher on which the paralytic was lying.

00:39:16.909 --> 00:39:20.909
When Jesus saw their faith,

00:39:20.909 --> 00:39:22.909
he said to the paralytic,

00:39:22.909 --> 00:39:25.909
child, your sins are forgiven.

00:39:25.909 --> 00:39:27.909
So yes, faith can be seen.

00:39:27.909 --> 00:39:29.909
It's seen in the way we act.

00:39:29.909 --> 00:39:31.909
Like other invisible things,

00:39:31.909 --> 00:39:34.909
faith is measured by its effects.

00:39:34.909 --> 00:39:38.909
In fact, James 226 says that faith

00:39:38.909 --> 00:39:41.909
without works is dead.

00:39:41.909 --> 00:39:45.909
The question is, can others see my faith?

00:39:45.909 --> 00:39:50.909
What effect is my faith producing in me?

00:39:50.909 --> 00:39:55.909
A turn with me pleased to 1 Corinthians chapter 16.

00:39:55.909 --> 00:39:58.909
One effect that faith has on people

00:39:58.909 --> 00:40:01.909
is that it moves them to expand their activity

00:40:01.909 --> 00:40:02.909
in Kingdom service.

00:40:02.909 --> 00:40:04.909
And notice how the Apostle Paul expressed this

00:40:04.909 --> 00:40:08.909
at 1 Corinthians 16-9.

00:40:08.909 --> 00:40:12.909
Because a large door that leads to activity

00:40:12.909 --> 00:40:17.909
has been open to me, but there are many composers.

00:40:17.909 --> 00:40:22.909
Paul took advantage of such opportunities to show his faith.

00:40:22.909 --> 00:40:26.909
Has Jehovah opened a door to activity for you?

00:40:26.909 --> 00:40:29.909
In this symposium, we're going to discuss five ways

00:40:29.909 --> 00:40:33.909
in which a temporary opportunity leading to great activity

00:40:33.909 --> 00:40:36.909
and making disciples might present itself.

00:40:36.909 --> 00:40:39.909
This could be in the form of learning a new language,

00:40:39.909 --> 00:40:41.909
moving where the need is greater,

00:40:41.909 --> 00:40:44.909
applying to attend the school for Kingdom evangelizers,

00:40:44.909 --> 00:40:47.909
assisting with a Theocratic building project

00:40:47.909 --> 00:40:51.909
or donating generously to support the Kingdom work.

00:40:51.909 --> 00:40:55.909
Now, why is faith needed to seize such opportunities?

00:40:55.909 --> 00:40:59.909
And what blessings do we receive when we do?

00:40:59.909 --> 00:41:04.909
First, why is faith needed to learn a new language

00:41:04.909 --> 00:41:06.909
in order to make disciples?

00:41:06.909 --> 00:41:09.909
A turn with me pleased to Zechariah chapter 8.

00:41:09.909 --> 00:41:12.909
A Zechariah chapter 8.

00:41:12.909 --> 00:41:16.909
It takes faith to discern that current events

00:41:16.909 --> 00:41:18.909
are fulfilling Bible prophecy.

00:41:18.909 --> 00:41:22.909
It takes faith to understand how we can act in harmony

00:41:22.909 --> 00:41:26.909
with God's purpose as revealed in that prophecy.

00:41:26.909 --> 00:41:30.909
A Zechariah 8.22 says,

00:41:31.909 --> 00:41:34.909
And many peoples and mighty nations

00:41:34.909 --> 00:41:39.909
will come to seek Jehovah of armies in Jerusalem

00:41:39.909 --> 00:41:43.909
and to beg for the favor of Jehovah.

00:41:43.909 --> 00:41:45.909
And verse 23 says,

00:41:45.909 --> 00:41:47.909
This is what Jehovah of army says.

00:41:47.909 --> 00:41:53.909
In those days, ten men out of all the languages of the nations

00:41:53.909 --> 00:41:55.909
will take hold.

00:41:55.909 --> 00:41:58.909
Yes, they will take firm hold of the robe of a Jew

00:41:58.909 --> 00:42:01.909
saying, We want to go with you

00:42:01.909 --> 00:42:06.909
for we have heard that God is with you people.

00:42:06.909 --> 00:42:10.909
Ten men, people who recognize

00:42:10.909 --> 00:42:12.909
that the only way to gain Jehovah's approval

00:42:12.909 --> 00:42:15.909
is to associate with those who already have it.

00:42:15.909 --> 00:42:18.909
The Jew also referred to here as

00:42:18.909 --> 00:42:21.909
you people, which people.

00:42:21.909 --> 00:42:24.909
Obviously not the people who refuse to pronounce God's name

00:42:24.909 --> 00:42:26.909
or those who remove it all together

00:42:26.909 --> 00:42:28.909
from their Bible translations.

00:42:28.909 --> 00:42:34.909
No, this refers to those who worship Jehovah by name.

00:42:34.909 --> 00:42:38.909
Spirit-annoyed Christians, the Israel of God,

00:42:38.909 --> 00:42:40.909
referred to at Galatians 6.16.

00:42:40.909 --> 00:42:45.909
And because ten can represent earthly completeness,

00:42:45.909 --> 00:42:48.909
the ten men represent all men and women

00:42:48.909 --> 00:42:51.909
who have the hope of living forever on earth.

00:42:51.909 --> 00:42:55.909
Now notice that they come not simply from all the nations,

00:42:55.909 --> 00:42:59.909
but from all the languages of the nations

00:42:59.909 --> 00:43:01.909
in order to learn Jehovah's requirements.

00:43:01.909 --> 00:43:06.909
Now how will they hear the voice of the Jew

00:43:06.909 --> 00:43:08.909
in their language?

00:43:08.909 --> 00:43:15.909
That might just be your door to activity.

00:43:15.909 --> 00:43:17.909
Now some might hesitate to learn a new language.

00:43:17.909 --> 00:43:19.909
Perhaps they hold back because of the time

00:43:19.909 --> 00:43:21.909
and energy that are required.

00:43:21.909 --> 00:43:23.909
Others feel that they lack the ability.

00:43:23.909 --> 00:43:25.909
That's true that before making any decision,

00:43:25.909 --> 00:43:27.909
we need to calculate the expense.

00:43:27.909 --> 00:43:30.909
The question here is one of faith.

00:43:30.909 --> 00:43:33.909
Can the God who gave ability to bezelil,

00:43:33.909 --> 00:43:36.909
who made the sun stand still for Joshua,

00:43:36.909 --> 00:43:39.909
who gave power to Sampson also give you

00:43:39.909 --> 00:43:42.909
the ability, time, and energy to help those

00:43:42.909 --> 00:43:47.909
who are begging for the favor of Jehovah?

00:43:47.909 --> 00:43:49.909
Remember Matthew 1720,

00:43:49.909 --> 00:43:53.909
if you have faith the size of a mustard grain,

00:43:53.909 --> 00:43:56.909
nothing will be impossible for you.

00:43:56.909 --> 00:43:59.909
And according to Philippians 2.13,

00:43:59.909 --> 00:44:02.909
Holy Spirit can give us even the desire

00:44:02.909 --> 00:44:06.909
to preach to those who speak another language.

00:44:06.909 --> 00:44:10.909
Is that Spirit drawing you now?

00:44:10.909 --> 00:44:13.909
Remember too that through his organization,

00:44:13.909 --> 00:44:15.909
Jehovah provides much help for those

00:44:15.909 --> 00:44:17.909
who are learning a new language.

00:44:17.909 --> 00:44:19.909
JW.org contains reading material,

00:44:19.909 --> 00:44:21.909
audio recordings, and videos,

00:44:21.909 --> 00:44:25.909
and more languages than any other website.

00:44:25.909 --> 00:44:28.909
Then we have the JW Language app,

00:44:28.909 --> 00:44:32.909
and language classes arranged by the branch office.

00:44:32.909 --> 00:44:35.909
When faith motivates us to make sacrifices

00:44:35.909 --> 00:44:37.909
to serve Jehovah,

00:44:37.909 --> 00:44:39.909
he will help us to succeed,

00:44:39.909 --> 00:44:43.909
and he will reward us with many blessings.

00:44:43.909 --> 00:44:45.909
For instance,

00:44:45.909 --> 00:44:48.909
a couple in their 60s kept finding Chinese people

00:44:48.909 --> 00:44:50.909
who accepted their invitations to attend

00:44:50.909 --> 00:44:52.909
congregation meetings.

00:44:52.909 --> 00:44:54.909
So they decided to learn Chinese,

00:44:54.909 --> 00:44:56.909
and within 10 years they studied

00:44:56.909 --> 00:45:00.909
with 112 Chinese people.

00:45:00.909 --> 00:45:02.909
Okay, but with so many languages,

00:45:02.909 --> 00:45:06.909
how do I know which language to start learning?

00:45:06.909 --> 00:45:09.909
Zechariah 822.

00:45:09.909 --> 00:45:12.909
Who is begging for the favor of Jehovah?

00:45:12.909 --> 00:45:15.909
You can learn about the needs in your area

00:45:15.909 --> 00:45:18.909
by consulting with the elders and the circuit overseer.

00:45:18.909 --> 00:45:20.909
In the following video,

00:45:20.909 --> 00:45:25.909
note how one couple responds to a need in the field.

00:45:25.909 --> 00:45:38.989
Oh, honestly, you shouldn't have.

00:45:38.989 --> 00:45:43.039
You're going to need it.

00:45:43.039 --> 00:45:47.039
Gabriel leaving to serve where the need is greater.

00:45:47.039 --> 00:45:49.039
Made us feel like we missed the chance

00:45:49.039 --> 00:45:51.039
to expand our ministry.

00:45:51.039 --> 00:45:56.050
Why don't we start now?

00:45:56.050 --> 00:45:57.050
We're not getting any younger.

00:45:57.050 --> 00:46:00.050
Yeah, we could ask the circuit overseer

00:46:00.050 --> 00:46:02.050
for our vice on his next visit.

00:46:02.050 --> 00:46:06.050
But I'm worried he's going to say

00:46:06.050 --> 00:46:09.050
we should join the new language group.

00:46:09.050 --> 00:46:12.050
It's a big need in our socket.

00:46:12.050 --> 00:46:14.050
We've never felt like the right people

00:46:14.050 --> 00:46:16.050
to serve in a foreign language.

00:46:16.050 --> 00:46:20.050
Brother Lindstrom shared Zechariah 823 with us,

00:46:20.050 --> 00:46:23.050
which helped us to see how we could have a hand

00:46:23.050 --> 00:46:26.050
in helping men out of all the languages of the nations.

00:46:26.050 --> 00:46:37.849
Learn about Jehovah.

00:46:37.849 --> 00:46:47.920
Learning was a struggle at first.

00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:50.920
But with Jehovah's help, we made progress.

00:46:50.920 --> 00:47:14.539
Slowly, even though the language was a challenge,

00:47:14.539 --> 00:47:34.119
loving our new family was not.

00:47:34.119 --> 00:47:36.119
Shukar Sabai.

00:47:36.119 --> 00:47:37.119
Shukar Sabai?

00:47:37.119 --> 00:47:40.119
My son, Tanoh Elliot.

00:47:40.119 --> 00:47:42.119
Dalai Jani Romani.

00:47:42.119 --> 00:47:43.119
Oh, yeah, Janava.

00:47:43.119 --> 00:47:45.119
Sari Siklin, Marijub.

00:47:45.119 --> 00:47:46.119
It's Vinny.

00:47:46.119 --> 00:47:47.119
Moment.

00:47:47.119 --> 00:47:48.119
I mean, don't.

00:47:48.119 --> 00:47:50.119
I don't understand.

00:47:50.119 --> 00:47:56.239
Morate, sonny.

00:47:56.239 --> 00:47:57.239
I'll cover.

00:47:57.239 --> 00:47:59.239
Say again what you say.

00:47:59.239 --> 00:48:01.239
I'm Shukar Sabai.

00:48:01.239 --> 00:48:04.239
I'm off Tanoh Elliot.

00:48:04.239 --> 00:48:06.239
He's the Verunava.

00:48:06.239 --> 00:48:09.239
Oh, Shasusus is the winner.

00:48:09.239 --> 00:48:11.239
Come on, Drei.

00:48:11.239 --> 00:48:13.239
Come on, Drei.

00:48:13.239 --> 00:48:14.239
Okay.

00:48:14.239 --> 00:48:16.239
Oh, thank you.

00:48:16.239 --> 00:48:20.250
It's true.

00:48:20.250 --> 00:48:22.250
We aren't getting any younger.

00:48:22.250 --> 00:48:28.190
And that's why we're so glad we took the chance

00:48:28.190 --> 00:48:30.190
to expand our ministry.

00:48:30.190 --> 00:48:37.769
Did you notice how Elliot and Karin showed faith

00:48:37.769 --> 00:48:39.769
and how they were blessed?

00:48:39.769 --> 00:48:41.769
They talked to their circuit overseer,

00:48:41.769 --> 00:48:44.769
who revealed a big need in a foreign language group

00:48:44.769 --> 00:48:46.769
in their circuit.

00:48:46.769 --> 00:48:49.769
He then showed them Zechariah 823.

00:48:49.769 --> 00:48:51.769
They read that scripture again later,

00:48:51.769 --> 00:48:54.769
and they prayed about it together,

00:48:54.769 --> 00:48:58.769
and then came the measurable effect of their faith.

00:48:58.769 --> 00:49:00.769
They put forth great efforts to learn.

00:49:00.769 --> 00:49:02.769
Then with humility and courage,

00:49:02.769 --> 00:49:05.769
they used their new language skills at the meetings

00:49:05.769 --> 00:49:07.769
and in the ministry.

00:49:07.769 --> 00:49:10.769
And they were able to help those who were begging

00:49:10.769 --> 00:49:12.769
for the favor of Jehovah.

00:49:12.769 --> 00:49:15.769
That's how it works.

00:49:15.769 --> 00:49:16.769
Simple?

00:49:16.769 --> 00:49:17.769
No.

00:49:17.769 --> 00:49:21.769
But if we invest the time and effort to learn a new language

00:49:21.769 --> 00:49:23.769
in order to do more for Jehovah,

00:49:23.769 --> 00:49:26.769
we can be confident that Jehovah will bless us

00:49:26.769 --> 00:49:28.769
with a rewarding ministry.

00:49:28.769 --> 00:49:30.769
As a couple from Britain said,

00:49:30.769 --> 00:49:33.769
the ministry in the foreign language field

00:49:33.769 --> 00:49:36.769
is one of the most exciting we've experienced

00:49:36.769 --> 00:49:40.769
during our 40 years of kingdom service.

00:49:40.769 --> 00:49:42.769
Why did they do it?

00:49:42.769 --> 00:49:45.769
Because people who are seeking Jehovah

00:49:45.769 --> 00:49:47.769
need to hear his requirements for life

00:49:47.769 --> 00:49:50.769
in words they can understand.

00:49:50.769 --> 00:49:52.769
A during a meeting held in Vietnamese,

00:49:52.769 --> 00:49:54.769
a man stood up and said,

00:49:54.769 --> 00:49:56.769
with tears in his eyes,

00:49:56.769 --> 00:49:58.769
thank you.

00:49:58.769 --> 00:50:00.769
Thank you for the efforts you are making

00:50:00.769 --> 00:50:02.769
to learn my difficult language.

00:50:02.769 --> 00:50:05.769
I am so grateful to learn many wonderful things

00:50:05.769 --> 00:50:08.769
from the Bible in my old age.

00:50:08.769 --> 00:50:12.769
After attending a circuit assembly in his native Albanian,

00:50:12.769 --> 00:50:14.769
a man in his 70s,

00:50:14.769 --> 00:50:16.769
living in New York City said,

00:50:16.769 --> 00:50:19.769
this is the best day of my life.

00:50:19.769 --> 00:50:21.769
He made arrangements that very day

00:50:21.769 --> 00:50:23.769
to start studying the Bible

00:50:23.769 --> 00:50:25.769
with a pioneer who had learned his language,

00:50:25.769 --> 00:50:27.769
and within just a few years,

00:50:27.769 --> 00:50:31.769
he began serving as a ministerial servant.

00:50:31.769 --> 00:50:35.769
These are blessings for exercising faith.

00:50:35.769 --> 00:50:40.769
Faith is measured by the way we act.

00:50:40.769 --> 00:50:45.769
Could you enter this door to activity and faith?

00:50:45.769 --> 00:50:47.769
Brother Samuel heard a member of the governing body

00:50:47.769 --> 00:50:50.769
will now consider the next talk of this symposium.

00:50:51.769 --> 00:50:53.769
Enter the door to activity and faith

00:50:53.769 --> 00:51:04.420
move to where the need is greater.

00:51:04.420 --> 00:51:06.420
Moving to serve for the need for kingdom preachers

00:51:06.420 --> 00:51:10.420
is greater can be intimidating.

00:51:10.420 --> 00:51:13.420
Before moving, we cannot know all the details

00:51:13.420 --> 00:51:16.420
of what our life will be like.

00:51:16.420 --> 00:51:18.420
However, the Bible can give us the wisdom

00:51:18.420 --> 00:51:21.420
to successfully meet any challenges

00:51:21.420 --> 00:51:24.420
we face after moving.

00:51:24.420 --> 00:51:26.420
We must put faith in it.

00:51:26.420 --> 00:51:29.420
Faith can motivate us to seize opportunities

00:51:29.420 --> 00:51:31.420
to serve Jehovah.

00:51:31.420 --> 00:51:35.420
Please locate Hebrews 11 to 8 through 10.

00:51:35.420 --> 00:51:38.420
Abram's willingness to leave

00:51:38.420 --> 00:51:40.420
what was comfortable and familiar

00:51:40.420 --> 00:51:42.420
and move to a new land

00:51:42.420 --> 00:51:44.420
when he was in his 70s

00:51:44.420 --> 00:51:49.420
was a powerful demonstration of faith.

00:51:49.420 --> 00:51:54.420
Let's read Hebrews 11, 8 through 10.

00:51:54.420 --> 00:51:57.420
By faith, Abraham, when he was called,

00:51:57.420 --> 00:52:00.420
obeyed by going out to a place

00:52:00.420 --> 00:52:03.420
he was to receive as an inheritance.

00:52:03.420 --> 00:52:07.420
He went out, although not knowing where he was going.

00:52:07.420 --> 00:52:09.420
By faith, he lived as a foreigner

00:52:09.420 --> 00:52:11.420
in the land of the promise

00:52:11.420 --> 00:52:13.420
as in a foreign land,

00:52:13.420 --> 00:52:16.420
living in tents with Isaac and Jacob,

00:52:16.420 --> 00:52:19.420
the airs with him of the very same promise.

00:52:19.420 --> 00:52:23.420
For he was awaiting the city having real foundations

00:52:23.420 --> 00:52:26.420
whose designer and builder is God.

00:52:26.420 --> 00:52:30.769
He didn't even know where he was being assigned.

00:52:30.769 --> 00:52:34.769
But he went based on his faith.

00:52:34.769 --> 00:52:38.769
He knew that the real life was not back home.

00:52:38.769 --> 00:52:41.769
It was not in his new assignment.

00:52:41.769 --> 00:52:46.769
He looked for the fulfillment of future promises.

00:52:46.769 --> 00:52:50.769
Did Abraham and Sarah face any difficulties along the way?

00:52:50.769 --> 00:52:52.769
Yes, they did.

00:52:53.769 --> 00:52:56.769
Unexpected circumstances were thrust upon them.

00:52:56.769 --> 00:52:59.769
But did Jehovah see them through?

00:52:59.769 --> 00:53:04.769
Find Genesis 20 verses 3 through 7.

00:53:04.769 --> 00:53:08.769
To protect his life, Abraham called Sarah his sister.

00:53:08.769 --> 00:53:14.769
So the king of Euror felt he could take her as his wife.

00:53:14.769 --> 00:53:18.769
This was a difficult time for Abraham and Sarah.

00:53:18.769 --> 00:53:21.769
Did Jehovah work things out?

00:53:21.769 --> 00:53:26.769
Let's read Genesis 20 verses 3 through 7.

00:53:26.769 --> 00:53:30.769
Afterward, God came by night to a Bimalak in a dream

00:53:30.769 --> 00:53:31.769
and said to him,

00:53:31.769 --> 00:53:35.769
Here you are as good as dead because of the woman

00:53:35.769 --> 00:53:39.769
whom you have taken since she is married

00:53:39.769 --> 00:53:42.769
and belongs to another man.

00:53:42.769 --> 00:53:45.769
However, a Bimalak had not gone near her.

00:53:45.769 --> 00:53:48.769
So he said, Jehovah,

00:53:48.769 --> 00:53:52.769
Will you kill a nation that is really innocent?

00:53:52.769 --> 00:53:55.769
Did he not say to me she is my sister

00:53:55.769 --> 00:53:59.769
and did she not say he is my brother?

00:53:59.769 --> 00:54:05.769
I did this with an honest heart and innocent hands.

00:54:05.769 --> 00:54:09.769
Then the true God said to him in the dream,

00:54:09.769 --> 00:54:12.769
I know that you did this with an honest heart.

00:54:12.769 --> 00:54:16.769
So I held you back from sinning against me.

00:54:16.769 --> 00:54:20.769
That is why I did not allow you to touch her.

00:54:20.769 --> 00:54:24.769
Now return the man's wife for he is a prophet

00:54:24.769 --> 00:54:26.769
and he will make supplication for you

00:54:26.769 --> 00:54:28.769
and you will keep living.

00:54:28.769 --> 00:54:31.769
But if you are not returning her,

00:54:31.769 --> 00:54:35.769
know that you will surely die.

00:54:35.769 --> 00:54:38.769
You and all who are yours.

00:54:38.769 --> 00:54:43.559
Jehovah will be with us too

00:54:43.559 --> 00:54:47.559
if we act in faith to expand our ministry.

00:54:47.559 --> 00:54:50.559
We will get through the surprises

00:54:50.559 --> 00:54:55.559
and enjoy the rewards of reaching out in this way.

00:54:55.559 --> 00:55:00.559
Although we cannot know all the challenges that we may encounter,

00:55:00.559 --> 00:55:04.559
we can take practical steps to choose a location

00:55:04.559 --> 00:55:08.559
and prepare to make adjustments.

00:55:08.559 --> 00:55:13.559
Do you remember Jesus' words at Luke chapter 14, verse 28?

00:55:13.559 --> 00:55:17.559
He indicated that a person who wanted to build a tower

00:55:17.559 --> 00:55:22.559
would first calculate the expense to see if he has enough to complete it.

00:55:22.559 --> 00:55:25.559
That was practical.

00:55:25.559 --> 00:55:32.559
And we can do the same when contemplating, relocating to where the need is greater.

00:55:32.559 --> 00:55:35.559
We can get a taste of the blessings we will experience

00:55:35.559 --> 00:55:40.559
by participating in preaching campaigns organized by the branch office

00:55:40.559 --> 00:55:44.559
or working seldom work territory.

00:55:44.559 --> 00:55:47.559
Might you have the circumstances to move

00:55:47.559 --> 00:55:49.559
or the need is greater?

00:55:49.559 --> 00:55:52.559
If you are interested in serving in another land,

00:55:52.559 --> 00:55:56.559
do careful research and speak to your congregation elders.

00:55:56.559 --> 00:56:00.559
They can forward your letter to the branch office of the country

00:56:00.559 --> 00:56:02.559
that interests you.

00:56:02.559 --> 00:56:05.559
If you are unable to move to another land,

00:56:05.559 --> 00:56:08.559
what is another option?

00:56:08.559 --> 00:56:11.559
You can, through your elders,

00:56:11.559 --> 00:56:14.559
write to the local branch office for information

00:56:14.559 --> 00:56:18.559
about congregations that have a need.

00:56:18.559 --> 00:56:21.559
Your circuit overseer can provide information

00:56:21.559 --> 00:56:25.559
about nearby congregations that may need help.

00:56:25.559 --> 00:56:28.559
In the following video, note how one brother

00:56:28.559 --> 00:56:34.559
overcame his fear of serving where the need is greater.

00:56:34.559 --> 00:56:37.559
If you told me two years ago

00:56:37.559 --> 00:56:41.559
that I'd be moving where the need was greater, I would have laughed.

00:56:41.559 --> 00:56:50.519
It all started when they announced a special preaching campaign.

00:56:50.519 --> 00:56:53.519
My friend Samuel encouraged me to apply with him.

00:56:53.519 --> 00:56:56.519
So, what do you think?

00:56:56.519 --> 00:57:01.519
Yeah, no, but you enjoy that.

00:57:01.519 --> 00:57:03.519
I know you're going to love it.

00:57:03.519 --> 00:57:05.519
That's why I got you a form as well.

00:57:05.519 --> 00:57:07.519
We can do this.

00:57:07.519 --> 00:57:14.530
I knew I could do more, but I was comfortable.

00:57:14.530 --> 00:57:17.530
I like doing things on my own terms.

00:57:17.530 --> 00:57:21.530
But really, I was afraid of the unknown.

00:57:21.530 --> 00:57:27.699
I needed to examine my heart.

00:57:27.699 --> 00:57:31.699
When I read about Abraham's faith at Hebrews 11-8,

00:57:31.699 --> 00:57:34.699
it's like the words jumped off the page.

00:57:34.699 --> 00:57:41.699
He went out, although not knowing where he was going.

00:57:41.699 --> 00:57:47.739
Who better to be in control of my life than Jehovah?

00:57:47.739 --> 00:57:49.739
A door was open to me.

00:57:49.739 --> 00:57:51.739
I just needed to go through it.

00:57:51.739 --> 00:57:55.739
And what I experienced changed my life.

00:57:55.739 --> 00:58:06.179
The results of the campaign were incredible.

00:58:06.179 --> 00:58:17.340
And the experience pushed me out of my comfort zone.

00:58:36.820 --> 00:58:48.369
I saw the ministry in a new way, and I wanted to do more.

00:58:48.369 --> 00:58:53.869
So I calculated the cost and worked with my local elders

00:58:53.869 --> 00:58:55.869
to write to the branch office.

00:58:55.869 --> 00:59:13.469
When I heard back with some suggestions, I prayed about it

00:59:13.469 --> 00:59:16.469
and did research before choosing.

00:59:16.469 --> 00:59:21.469
There were many unknowns, but I couldn't wait.

00:59:21.469 --> 00:59:24.469
It was hard to say goodbye to my friends.

00:59:24.469 --> 00:59:42.219
But I was ready for whatever Jehovah had installed me.

00:59:42.219 --> 00:59:46.219
Did you notice how faith was shown and what blessings resulted?

00:59:46.219 --> 00:59:52.530
The young brother admitted he was in a comfort zone.

00:59:52.530 --> 00:59:57.530
Another brother invited him to join in a special preaching campaign.

00:59:57.530 --> 01:00:01.530
Our brother was hesitant to reach out.

01:00:01.530 --> 01:00:04.530
However, he read about Abraham.

01:00:04.530 --> 01:00:06.530
What did he conclude?

01:00:06.530 --> 01:00:11.530
He said, who better to control my life than Jehovah?

01:00:11.530 --> 01:00:18.159
He thoroughly enjoyed the experience of the special campaign.

01:00:18.159 --> 01:00:20.159
It fired him up.

01:00:20.159 --> 01:00:25.159
And the next thing we know, he is relocating to another congregation

01:00:25.159 --> 01:00:28.159
that needed help.

01:00:28.159 --> 01:00:31.159
Although you will need to make sacrifices

01:00:31.159 --> 01:00:34.159
and you may face unexpected challenges,

01:00:34.159 --> 01:00:37.159
you will gain many blessings,

01:00:37.159 --> 01:00:41.159
drawing you ever closer to Jehovah.

01:00:41.159 --> 01:00:47.159
There is no need to worry about the good things you may be denied temporarily.

01:00:47.159 --> 01:00:51.159
Jehovah knows what you presently need

01:00:51.159 --> 01:00:56.159
and will supply it to you on time.

01:00:56.159 --> 01:01:00.159
Luke 12, 31, advises,

01:01:00.159 --> 01:01:02.159
keep seeking God's kingdom

01:01:02.159 --> 01:01:06.159
and all the things you need will be added to you.

01:01:06.159 --> 01:01:10.159
As a single person or as a family,

01:01:10.159 --> 01:01:15.159
consider if you can move to where the need is greater.

01:01:15.159 --> 01:01:20.980
Brother Mark Numer, a helper to the teaching committee,

01:01:20.980 --> 01:01:24.980
will now consider the next talk of this symposium.

01:01:24.980 --> 01:01:28.980
Enter the door to activity and faith,

01:01:28.980 --> 01:01:33.980
a plan for the school for a kingdom evangelizers.

01:01:33.980 --> 01:01:43.900
Proverbs chapter 10 verse 22 states,

01:01:43.900 --> 01:01:48.900
it is the blessing of Jehovah that makes rich and he adds no pain with it.

01:01:48.900 --> 01:01:52.900
Jehovah blesses those he loves with gifts of divine approval,

01:01:52.900 --> 01:01:55.900
guidance and spiritual prosperity.

01:01:55.900 --> 01:01:59.900
And when we enter a door of kingdom activity and faith,

01:01:59.900 --> 01:02:03.900
we are putting ourselves in line for a rich blessing from Jehovah.

01:02:03.900 --> 01:02:08.900
One of those doors is this school for kingdom evangelizers.

01:02:08.900 --> 01:02:12.900
Now, what just came to your mind when you heard that school?

01:02:12.900 --> 01:02:15.900
Did you think, well, that's a great school,

01:02:15.900 --> 01:02:18.900
if you have special circumstances to apply for it,

01:02:18.900 --> 01:02:23.900
or I'm too old for that, or I'm too young for that.

01:02:23.900 --> 01:02:25.900
I'm already serving with the need is great.

01:02:25.900 --> 01:02:27.900
I'm needed here.

01:02:27.900 --> 01:02:29.900
They could send me anywhere after the school

01:02:29.900 --> 01:02:33.900
and I'm not really comfortable with that.

01:02:33.900 --> 01:02:36.900
Those are honest feelings and understandable.

01:02:36.900 --> 01:02:41.900
But we want to be careful that feelings don't turn into stumbling stones

01:02:41.900 --> 01:02:45.900
that would prevent us from receiving a blessing from Jehovah.

01:02:45.900 --> 01:02:51.900
Let's use Timothy as an example of one who entered a door of kingdom activity

01:02:51.900 --> 01:02:55.900
and received Jehovah's rich blessing.

01:02:55.900 --> 01:02:58.900
Timothy received a personal invitation from the Apostle Paul

01:02:58.900 --> 01:03:01.900
to expand his ministry.

01:03:01.900 --> 01:03:05.900
At first glance, the two men probably looked nothing alike,

01:03:05.900 --> 01:03:07.900
so imagine that scene.

01:03:07.900 --> 01:03:09.900
Paul was older, a man of experience.

01:03:09.900 --> 01:03:14.900
Timothy was young probably in his late teens or early 20s.

01:03:14.900 --> 01:03:17.900
Paul was bold in his speech, tireless in his ministry,

01:03:17.900 --> 01:03:20.900
and resilient to opposition.

01:03:20.900 --> 01:03:25.900
Yet on the other hand, the scriptures indicate that young Timothy was perhaps shy,

01:03:25.900 --> 01:03:29.900
hesitant, and lacked self-confidence.

01:03:29.900 --> 01:03:34.900
What stumbling stones could have existed in Timothy's mind

01:03:34.900 --> 01:03:39.900
as he pondered Paul's invitation?

01:03:39.900 --> 01:03:44.900
Let's open our Bibles to 2 Timothy chapter 3 and read verse 10 and 11,

01:03:44.900 --> 01:03:46.900
and we'll find out.

01:03:46.900 --> 01:03:51.900
2 Timothy chapter 3, and we're going to read verse 10 and 11.

01:03:51.900 --> 01:03:55.900
Now notice that Paul wrote this to Timothy many years later,

01:03:55.900 --> 01:04:00.900
but let's see what we can learn, verse 10.

01:04:01.900 --> 01:04:06.900
But you have closely followed my teaching, my course of life,

01:04:06.900 --> 01:04:11.900
my purpose, my faith, my patience, my love, my endurance,

01:04:11.900 --> 01:04:16.900
the persecutions and sufferings, such as I experienced in now notice,

01:04:16.900 --> 01:04:21.900
Antioch, and Iconium, and in Listera.

01:04:21.900 --> 01:04:24.900
Now where was Timothy from?

01:04:24.900 --> 01:04:26.900
Listera.

01:04:26.900 --> 01:04:31.900
The young man likely witnessed how Paul suffered ruthless beatings in Listera

01:04:31.900 --> 01:04:33.900
at the hands of opposers.

01:04:33.900 --> 01:04:38.900
Can you feel Timothy's possible hesitation as he now looks at Paul,

01:04:38.900 --> 01:04:41.900
extending his hand out to him?

01:04:41.900 --> 01:04:46.900
Perhaps even eyeing the scars of Paul and Paul says, come with me.

01:04:46.900 --> 01:04:51.900
Timothy had to wonder, if I go with you, it's not going to be easy.

01:04:51.900 --> 01:04:55.900
Will I suffer as you suffered?

01:04:55.900 --> 01:05:01.900
Another possible stumbling stone for Timothy was the fact that he was already

01:05:01.900 --> 01:05:06.900
serving in a capable way in the newly formed congregation in Listera,

01:05:06.900 --> 01:05:09.900
and was well reported on by the brothers.

01:05:09.900 --> 01:05:14.900
And now Paul was asking him to leave it all, including his family and friends.

01:05:14.900 --> 01:05:18.900
Timothy could have reasoned, they need me, my mother needs me,

01:05:18.900 --> 01:05:21.900
my grandmother needs me here.

01:05:21.900 --> 01:05:25.900
Maybe I can join Paul in a few years when I gained more experience.

01:05:25.900 --> 01:05:31.179
And perhaps yet another stumbling stone for Timothy could have been the fact that

01:05:31.179 --> 01:05:35.179
he did not know where his assignment would take him.

01:05:35.179 --> 01:05:39.179
Listera was a small, rustic town secluded in a valley.

01:05:39.179 --> 01:05:44.179
He knew the people, the landscape, the food, the language, the culture.

01:05:44.179 --> 01:05:48.179
Timothy knew that accompanying Paul met venturing into the unknown.

01:05:48.179 --> 01:05:52.179
He had to wonder, and I'm really ready for this.

01:05:52.179 --> 01:05:59.179
I have a weak stomach, and it's already feeling weaker just thinking about going with Paul.

01:05:59.179 --> 01:06:02.179
Can you see yourself in Timothy?

01:06:02.179 --> 01:06:08.179
He no doubt had some real concerns before accepting Paul's offer.

01:06:08.179 --> 01:06:13.179
But what did Timothy's faith allow him to see?

01:06:13.179 --> 01:06:18.179
Well, let's read again Paul's words at 2 Timothy this time, verse 11,

01:06:18.179 --> 01:06:26.840
but verse 11, B, 2 Timothy, chapter 3, verse 11, B.

01:06:26.840 --> 01:06:30.840
I endured these persecutions, and now note this,

01:06:30.840 --> 01:06:35.840
and the Lord rescued me from them all.

01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:41.840
Timothy witnessed first hand how Jehovah rescued and strengthened Paul.

01:06:41.840 --> 01:06:45.840
So yes, in faith, Timothy did enter the door of activity,

01:06:46.840 --> 01:06:50.840
and he had worked with Paul together for many years.

01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:55.840
But think of the blessings he received because of his decision to join Paul.

01:06:55.840 --> 01:07:02.840
He observed how Paul navigated through each trial, how Paul kept his inner peace.

01:07:02.840 --> 01:07:07.840
Timothy saw not just the inconveniences or the sufferings of Paul,

01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:11.840
but he had observed Paul stabilizing joy,

01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:16.840
and he witnessed how Jehovah helped him each step of the way.

01:07:16.840 --> 01:07:21.840
With Jehovah's help, Timothy stretched beyond his somewhat shy hesitant nature

01:07:21.840 --> 01:07:29.840
to reach his full potential as a zealous overseer in support of the truth.

01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:46.329
Now in the following video, note what reasoning helped Gabriel decide to apply for the school for Kingdom evangelizers.

01:07:46.329 --> 01:07:51.329
At our convention, they had the meeting for the school for Kingdom evangelizers.

01:07:51.329 --> 01:07:54.329
My friend Anton asked if I was going to go.

01:07:54.329 --> 01:07:55.329
Thank you, Gabriel.

01:07:55.329 --> 01:07:56.329
Oh, hey Anton.

01:07:56.329 --> 01:07:57.329
Are you coming?

01:07:57.329 --> 01:07:58.329
To what?

01:07:58.329 --> 01:07:59.329
The ESK meeting.

01:07:59.329 --> 01:08:04.329
Oh, no, I wasn't planning on it, but...

01:08:04.329 --> 01:08:05.329
All right then.

01:08:05.329 --> 01:08:06.329
Yeah, sure. I'll go.

01:08:06.329 --> 01:08:07.329
Okay then.

01:08:07.329 --> 01:08:11.380
I'll have to wait a second.

01:08:11.380 --> 01:08:14.380
I went, but I felt conflicted.

01:08:14.380 --> 01:08:17.380
I thought I already have an assignment.

01:08:17.380 --> 01:08:19.380
One that I love.

01:08:19.380 --> 01:08:26.380
But I didn't fully understand the incredible privilege of attending ESK.

01:08:26.380 --> 01:08:30.380
I asked the circuit officer a few more questions,

01:08:30.380 --> 01:08:33.380
and it felt like this is it.

01:08:33.380 --> 01:08:38.380
It seemed right, and all I had to do was apply online.

01:08:38.380 --> 01:08:42.380
But that was months ago.

01:08:42.380 --> 01:08:44.380
So what's holding you back?

01:08:44.380 --> 01:08:46.380
I feel like Jehovah led me here.

01:08:46.380 --> 01:08:49.380
And I've never been happier.

01:08:49.380 --> 01:08:54.380
But now another door's opened, and the fear's back.

01:08:54.380 --> 01:08:57.380
It doesn't matter how far you've come.

01:08:57.380 --> 01:09:00.380
Fear in the unknown could be overwhelming.

01:09:00.380 --> 01:09:04.380
Sometimes you need a reminder that Jehovah's leading you in the right direction.

01:09:04.380 --> 01:09:07.380
Here's one to keep in mind.

01:09:07.380 --> 01:09:10.380
Philippians 4, 13.

01:09:10.380 --> 01:09:11.380
Read it.

01:09:11.380 --> 01:09:24.819
And just think about how far Jehovah's taking you.

01:09:24.819 --> 01:09:32.819
For all things, I have the strength through the one who gives me power.

01:09:32.819 --> 01:09:52.520
Jehovah is in control.

01:09:52.520 --> 01:10:09.270
What was I so afraid of?

01:10:09.270 --> 01:10:11.270
I'm bringing too much.

01:10:11.270 --> 01:10:14.270
Well, ESK is for two months.

01:10:14.270 --> 01:10:16.270
Oh, you were just delight you too.

01:10:16.270 --> 01:10:21.739
Bringing every last thing with you.

01:10:21.739 --> 01:10:24.739
Can I leave this with you?

01:10:24.739 --> 01:10:26.739
It's been on a few adventures,

01:10:26.739 --> 01:10:29.739
but it's still great for travel.

01:10:29.739 --> 01:10:31.739
Really? Yeah, please.

01:10:31.739 --> 01:10:41.869
Who knows? You might need it sometimes, too.

01:10:41.869 --> 01:10:45.869
Did you notice how faith was shown?

01:10:45.869 --> 01:10:48.869
Gabriel was in fear of the unknown.

01:10:48.869 --> 01:10:53.869
But Philippians 4 and verse 13 touched his heart, stirred his feelings,

01:10:53.869 --> 01:10:58.869
and helped him to trust in Jehovah and move forward in faith

01:10:58.869 --> 01:11:02.869
and apply for the school for kingdom evangelizers.

01:11:02.869 --> 01:11:05.869
If you choose to enter through the door of SKE,

01:11:05.869 --> 01:11:07.869
you will receive specialized training

01:11:07.869 --> 01:11:12.869
so that you can be used more fully by Jehovah and his organization.

01:11:12.869 --> 01:11:15.869
Remember, it's not a leap of faith

01:11:15.869 --> 01:11:18.869
with no idea of how things might turn out.

01:11:18.869 --> 01:11:21.869
It is an informed decision

01:11:21.869 --> 01:11:25.869
with a guaranteed outcome of blessings from Jehovah.

01:11:25.869 --> 01:11:30.869
Will you trust that Jehovah will help you every step of the way?

01:11:30.869 --> 01:11:33.869
If so, like Timothy,

01:11:33.869 --> 01:11:35.869
you will experience firsthand

01:11:35.869 --> 01:11:39.869
how the blessing of Jehovah makes rich.

01:11:39.869 --> 01:11:44.149
Brother Robert Lucioni, a helper to the publishing committee,

01:11:44.149 --> 01:11:48.149
will now consider the next talk of this symposium.

01:11:48.149 --> 01:11:51.149
Enter the door to activity and faith

01:11:51.149 --> 01:11:54.149
assist with a Theocratic Building Project.

01:11:54.149 --> 01:12:04.420
Would you like to assist with a Theocratic Building Project?

01:12:05.420 --> 01:12:09.420
You may see reports regarding branch construction and renovation

01:12:09.420 --> 01:12:12.420
or the need for new kingdom halls

01:12:12.420 --> 01:12:14.420
and remote translation offices.

01:12:14.420 --> 01:12:16.420
And this may cause you to wonder

01:12:16.420 --> 01:12:18.420
if you could have a share.

01:12:18.420 --> 01:12:21.420
Well, that is a wonderful goal.

01:12:21.420 --> 01:12:24.420
Now, as we've considered in this symposium,

01:12:24.420 --> 01:12:27.420
it takes faith to do more for Jehovah.

01:12:27.420 --> 01:12:30.420
Well, likewise, faith is required

01:12:30.420 --> 01:12:33.420
to share in a Theocratic Building Project.

01:12:33.420 --> 01:12:35.420
Now, why is that?

01:12:35.420 --> 01:12:37.420
Well, generally, there are two concerns.

01:12:37.420 --> 01:12:40.420
One, we may lack experience.

01:12:40.420 --> 01:12:43.420
We may feel that we do not have construction, design,

01:12:43.420 --> 01:12:46.420
engineering, or real estate experience,

01:12:46.420 --> 01:12:48.420
and thus we may feel inadequate

01:12:48.420 --> 01:12:53.420
to assist with a local design construction or other project.

01:12:53.420 --> 01:12:57.420
Or two, we may also realize that to begin assisting,

01:12:57.420 --> 01:13:01.420
generally, we do so on a temporary basis.

01:13:01.420 --> 01:13:04.420
Therefore, we may have concerns about leaving our job

01:13:04.420 --> 01:13:08.420
or our family for a period of time to assist.

01:13:08.420 --> 01:13:11.420
Well, if you can relate to those concerns

01:13:11.420 --> 01:13:13.420
and note out the example of Nehemiah

01:13:13.420 --> 01:13:15.420
will build your faith.

01:13:15.420 --> 01:13:20.420
Turn please to Nehemiah chapter 1, verse 2 and 3.

01:13:20.420 --> 01:13:23.420
Nehemiah 1, 2 and 3.

01:13:23.420 --> 01:13:27.420
At that time, Haneinai, one of my brothers,

01:13:27.420 --> 01:13:30.420
arrived with other men from Judah,

01:13:30.420 --> 01:13:32.420
and I asked him about the remaining Jews

01:13:32.420 --> 01:13:36.420
who had escaped the captivity and also about Jerusalem.

01:13:36.420 --> 01:13:40.420
They replied, those remaining there in the province

01:13:40.420 --> 01:13:44.420
who have survived the captivity are in a terrible situation

01:13:44.420 --> 01:13:48.420
and in disgrace, the walls of Jerusalem are broken down

01:13:48.420 --> 01:13:51.420
and its gates have been burned with fire.

01:13:51.420 --> 01:13:54.420
Nehemiah here is presented with a knee.

01:13:54.420 --> 01:13:55.420
What would he do?

01:13:55.420 --> 01:13:58.420
Would he say, oh, I hope those skilled brothers

01:13:58.420 --> 01:14:00.420
were in that situation one day.

01:14:00.420 --> 01:14:03.420
Look at chapter 2 and verse 5.

01:14:03.420 --> 01:14:05.420
I then said to the king,

01:14:05.420 --> 01:14:07.420
if it pleases the king

01:14:07.420 --> 01:14:10.420
and if your servant has found favor with you,

01:14:10.420 --> 01:14:13.420
send me to Judah to the city

01:14:13.420 --> 01:14:15.420
where my forefathers are buried

01:14:15.420 --> 01:14:18.420
so that I may rebuild it.

01:14:18.420 --> 01:14:19.420
Yes, Nehemiah was moved.

01:14:19.420 --> 01:14:21.420
He wanted to help.

01:14:21.420 --> 01:14:23.420
He saw an opportunity

01:14:23.420 --> 01:14:25.420
and demonstrated his faith.

01:14:25.420 --> 01:14:27.420
He took the initiative.

01:14:28.420 --> 01:14:32.420
Now, did it take faith for Nehemiah to take this step?

01:14:32.420 --> 01:14:33.420
Well, no doubt it did.

01:14:33.420 --> 01:14:35.420
Why do we say that?

01:14:35.420 --> 01:14:38.420
Well, first off, what was Nehemiah's work assignment?

01:14:38.420 --> 01:14:42.420
Was he the head of the King's construction project?

01:14:42.420 --> 01:14:46.420
Was he the leading architect or engineer or city planner?

01:14:46.420 --> 01:14:47.420
No.

01:14:47.420 --> 01:14:51.420
No, rather, he was the cup bearer to the king.

01:14:51.420 --> 01:14:52.420
You can picture him saying,

01:14:52.420 --> 01:14:54.420
well, I don't have the experience

01:14:54.420 --> 01:14:56.420
to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem.

01:14:56.420 --> 01:14:57.420
I don't know where to start.

01:14:57.420 --> 01:15:00.420
Maybe I best leave that to somebody else.

01:15:00.420 --> 01:15:02.420
No, rather, he saw the need.

01:15:02.420 --> 01:15:04.420
He had the circumstances to help

01:15:04.420 --> 01:15:07.420
and he acted on that need.

01:15:07.420 --> 01:15:09.420
At Nehemiah did not let his possible

01:15:09.420 --> 01:15:12.420
lack of experience hold him back.

01:15:12.420 --> 01:15:14.420
That took faith.

01:15:14.420 --> 01:15:18.420
Now, what about the fact that this was only a temporary assignment?

01:15:18.420 --> 01:15:20.420
Well, Nehemiah again was willing

01:15:20.420 --> 01:15:22.420
to leave his prestigious position

01:15:22.420 --> 01:15:24.420
as the cup bearer to the king.

01:15:24.420 --> 01:15:25.420
You think about it?

01:15:25.420 --> 01:15:27.420
He could have wondered whether his replacement

01:15:27.420 --> 01:15:30.420
would take over his position permanently.

01:15:30.420 --> 01:15:32.420
Would his nice job be there

01:15:32.420 --> 01:15:35.420
when he returned from Jerusalem?

01:15:35.420 --> 01:15:37.420
Well, Nehemiah showed faith

01:15:37.420 --> 01:15:40.420
that Jehovah had loyal love

01:15:40.420 --> 01:15:42.420
and would remember him.

01:15:42.420 --> 01:15:46.420
Notice his words in Nehemiah chapter 1 and verse 5.

01:15:46.420 --> 01:15:48.420
I said,

01:15:48.420 --> 01:15:50.420
Oh, Jehovah, the God of the heavens,

01:15:50.420 --> 01:15:53.420
the great and awe-inspiring God,

01:15:53.420 --> 01:15:55.420
who keeps his covenant

01:15:55.420 --> 01:15:58.420
and shows loyal love to those who love him

01:15:58.420 --> 01:16:01.420
and keep his commandments.

01:16:01.420 --> 01:16:02.420
Yes, Nehemiah was confident

01:16:02.420 --> 01:16:05.420
Jehovah would show loyal love.

01:16:05.420 --> 01:16:07.420
Jehovah would work things out.

01:16:07.420 --> 01:16:10.420
And what was the result of Nehemiah's faith?

01:16:10.420 --> 01:16:14.420
Well, although at first Nehemiah was not known as a builder,

01:16:14.420 --> 01:16:16.420
Jehovah used him in a mighty way

01:16:16.420 --> 01:16:18.420
to accomplish, as well.

01:16:18.420 --> 01:16:20.420
And Nehemiah contributed to the rebuilding

01:16:20.420 --> 01:16:22.420
of the walls of Jerusalem

01:16:22.420 --> 01:16:25.420
in significant ways.

01:16:25.420 --> 01:16:27.420
What's the lesson?

01:16:27.420 --> 01:16:30.420
Well, the lesson is we need faith

01:16:30.420 --> 01:16:31.420
if we are going to assist

01:16:31.420 --> 01:16:34.420
with a Theocratic building project.

01:16:34.420 --> 01:16:36.420
Now, primarily, we need brothers and sisters

01:16:36.420 --> 01:16:39.420
who have a strong relationship with Jehovah

01:16:39.420 --> 01:16:40.420
and a willing spirit.

01:16:40.420 --> 01:16:42.420
Those are the qualities we need.

01:16:42.420 --> 01:16:46.420
A construction or technical skills can be learned.

01:16:46.420 --> 01:16:49.420
And strong faith will give us the confidence

01:16:49.420 --> 01:16:51.420
that if we are invited,

01:16:51.420 --> 01:16:54.420
Jehovah will make us equal to the task

01:16:54.420 --> 01:16:57.420
and help us to develop the skills that are needed.

01:16:57.420 --> 01:17:00.420
And faith will also help us to trust

01:17:00.420 --> 01:17:04.420
that Jehovah will care for us when our assignment is over.

01:17:04.420 --> 01:17:06.420
In the following video,

01:17:06.420 --> 01:17:10.420
note how Sarah found the courage to assist

01:17:10.420 --> 01:17:20.500
in a Theocratic building project.

01:17:20.500 --> 01:17:23.500
When Alenda was invited to work for a few weeks

01:17:23.500 --> 01:17:25.500
on the upcoming construction projects,

01:17:25.500 --> 01:17:28.500
I was thrilled for their excitement,

01:17:28.500 --> 01:17:30.500
quickly turning to anxiety,

01:17:30.500 --> 01:17:33.500
because of what I had to do.

01:17:33.500 --> 01:17:40.100
I pray to Jehovah for weeks

01:17:40.100 --> 01:17:43.100
to give me the strength to have the conversation

01:17:43.100 --> 01:17:44.100
with my employer.

01:17:44.100 --> 01:17:57.699
All right, Sarah. Come in.

01:17:57.699 --> 01:17:58.699
So?

01:17:58.699 --> 01:17:59.699
I wanted to, first of all, say,

01:17:59.699 --> 01:18:01.699
thank you for taking it.

01:18:01.699 --> 01:18:04.699
I began to explain about the construction project

01:18:04.699 --> 01:18:07.699
and how I'd been invited to volunteer.

01:18:07.699 --> 01:18:10.699
So you want time off

01:18:10.699 --> 01:18:13.699
during the busiest time of our year?

01:18:13.699 --> 01:18:17.840
Well, yes.

01:18:17.840 --> 01:18:20.840
It's your choice, but under no circumstances

01:18:20.840 --> 01:18:22.840
will I hold your position.

01:18:22.840 --> 01:18:31.810
Suddenly, this beautiful privilege felt like a huge risk.

01:18:31.810 --> 01:18:35.810
Was I making my life more complicated by doing this?

01:18:35.810 --> 01:18:54.630
I read the account about the people in Nehemiah's day.

01:18:55.630 --> 01:18:59.630
Their will in spirit demonstrated faith

01:18:59.630 --> 01:19:02.630
and Jerusalem's walls were built by people

01:19:02.630 --> 01:19:09.699
who put their heart into the work.

01:19:09.699 --> 01:19:12.699
I didn't want to miss out on the opportunity

01:19:12.699 --> 01:19:14.699
to save Jehovah in that way.

01:19:14.699 --> 01:19:20.600
This is my resignation letter.

01:19:20.600 --> 01:19:22.600
I had to have faith that Jehovah

01:19:22.600 --> 01:19:25.600
would bless my decision.

01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:28.600
I'm not sure what the future holds when I get back,

01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:32.600
but I know Jehovah would take care of me.

01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:42.220
For now, I'm going to focus on putting my heart into the work.

01:19:42.220 --> 01:19:56.899
Can you relate to when Sarah went to meet her employer

01:19:56.899 --> 01:20:00.899
or how she struggled with the decision of what to do?

01:20:00.899 --> 01:20:02.899
Well, how did Sarah resolve her concerns?

01:20:02.899 --> 01:20:06.899
Well, remember she examined the example of Nehemiah and others

01:20:06.899 --> 01:20:08.899
and this gave her courage to act.

01:20:08.899 --> 01:20:12.899
And as a result, she enjoyed many blessings.

01:20:12.899 --> 01:20:14.899
Well, many of our brothers and sisters

01:20:14.899 --> 01:20:16.899
have made the same choice.

01:20:16.899 --> 01:20:19.899
For example, one couple had to give up their apartment

01:20:19.899 --> 01:20:23.899
and resign from their secular employment to help with the project.

01:20:23.899 --> 01:20:26.899
Now, they said they did feel some anxiety

01:20:26.899 --> 01:20:29.899
as the end of their six-month assignment near.

01:20:29.899 --> 01:20:32.899
But they trusted that Jehovah would help them

01:20:32.899 --> 01:20:34.899
and help he did.

01:20:34.899 --> 01:20:37.899
When they returned, they called their former employer

01:20:37.899 --> 01:20:40.899
and not only did he offer them their job back,

01:20:40.899 --> 01:20:42.899
but it was at better terms.

01:20:42.899 --> 01:20:45.899
And they said that within one week of returning back,

01:20:45.899 --> 01:20:48.899
they had found a new apartment.

01:20:48.899 --> 01:20:51.899
In another example, the local design construction department

01:20:51.899 --> 01:20:54.899
invited a brother to work for a few months on a project.

01:20:54.899 --> 01:20:58.899
Now, at the time, he was working full time with a major company.

01:20:58.899 --> 01:21:03.899
He had good benefits, a good salary, a company car, housing.

01:21:03.899 --> 01:21:06.899
He requested a leave of absence.

01:21:06.899 --> 01:21:08.899
They denied his request.

01:21:08.899 --> 01:21:12.899
Our brother decided to take the LDC assignment anyway.

01:21:12.899 --> 01:21:14.899
He was fired from his job.

01:21:14.899 --> 01:21:18.899
So what would he do after he completed his assignment?

01:21:18.899 --> 01:21:22.899
Well, he actually was able to find a part-time job

01:21:22.899 --> 01:21:24.899
that has allowed him to stay in full-time service.

01:21:24.899 --> 01:21:26.899
And now he is a pioneer.

01:21:26.899 --> 01:21:28.899
He and his wife are pioneers,

01:21:28.899 --> 01:21:30.899
and he's serving as a remote volunteer

01:21:30.899 --> 01:21:32.899
for a branch construction project.

01:21:32.899 --> 01:21:37.899
And similar stories are repeated over and over.

01:21:37.899 --> 01:21:40.899
Jehovah foretold that during these last days

01:21:40.899 --> 01:21:43.899
a great crowd would worship him acceptably.

01:21:43.899 --> 01:21:47.899
And the fulfillment of that prophecy has created an urgent need

01:21:47.899 --> 01:21:49.899
for more kingdom halls, assembly halls,

01:21:49.899 --> 01:21:53.899
branch facilities, remote translation offices.

01:21:53.899 --> 01:21:57.899
Now, we understand that the pandemic has limited

01:21:57.899 --> 01:22:01.899
theocratic building projects to some extent at this time.

01:22:02.899 --> 01:22:06.899
However, there is still much work to do now

01:22:06.899 --> 01:22:08.899
and on into the future.

01:22:08.899 --> 01:22:11.899
So if your health and circumstances permit,

01:22:11.899 --> 01:22:13.899
make yourself available.

01:22:13.899 --> 01:22:19.899
You can do so by filling out the A19 and DC50 applications.

01:22:19.899 --> 01:22:24.899
Your elders can help you to access these on JW.org.

01:22:24.899 --> 01:22:28.899
So if assisting with a Theocratic building project

01:22:28.899 --> 01:22:31.899
is your goal, you can be confident that you too

01:22:31.899 --> 01:22:34.899
will become powerful by faith.

01:22:34.899 --> 01:22:36.899
Take that leap.

01:22:36.899 --> 01:22:38.899
You will enjoy Jehovah's support

01:22:38.899 --> 01:22:42.899
and many, many blessings.

01:22:42.899 --> 01:22:44.899
Now, brother Gaius Glocken team,

01:22:44.899 --> 01:22:46.899
a helper to the publishing committee

01:22:46.899 --> 01:22:49.899
will consider the final talk of this symposium,

01:22:49.899 --> 01:22:52.899
enter the door to activity and faith,

01:22:52.899 --> 01:22:56.899
set something aside for Jehovah's work.

01:23:05.010 --> 01:23:07.010
There is no other organization

01:23:07.010 --> 01:23:10.010
that compares to Jehovah's organization.

01:23:10.010 --> 01:23:12.010
Everything the organization provides

01:23:12.010 --> 01:23:15.010
and helps with is free of charge.

01:23:15.010 --> 01:23:18.010
But Jehovah invites all of us to give to him

01:23:18.010 --> 01:23:20.010
or contribute our material resources

01:23:20.010 --> 01:23:23.010
according to what we personally decide.

01:23:23.010 --> 01:23:27.010
Now, why is this giving a matter of faith?

01:23:27.010 --> 01:23:29.010
Could it be that we hold back

01:23:29.010 --> 01:23:32.010
because one,

01:23:32.010 --> 01:23:34.010
we might feel that if we are generous,

01:23:34.010 --> 01:23:37.010
we might not have enough for our own needs.

01:23:37.010 --> 01:23:39.010
To think this way is understandable.

01:23:39.010 --> 01:23:41.010
Life is unpredictable,

01:23:41.010 --> 01:23:43.010
and nobody knows what the future holds

01:23:43.010 --> 01:23:47.010
and what our material needs might be tomorrow.

01:23:47.010 --> 01:23:50.010
Or could it be that we hold back too?

01:23:50.010 --> 01:23:52.010
Because we feel that our personal contribution

01:23:52.010 --> 01:23:56.010
is so small and therefore insignificant.

01:23:56.010 --> 01:23:59.010
Maybe we have very little material

01:23:59.010 --> 01:24:01.010
because we live in a poor country.

01:24:01.010 --> 01:24:05.010
Or we struggle to cover our expenses for other reasons.

01:24:05.010 --> 01:24:09.010
So we see that our giving really depends

01:24:09.010 --> 01:24:12.010
on how we connect this with Jehovah.

01:24:12.010 --> 01:24:14.010
Our view of Jehovah,

01:24:14.010 --> 01:24:16.010
our friendship with Jehovah

01:24:16.010 --> 01:24:19.010
needs to influence our actions

01:24:19.010 --> 01:24:22.010
and this requires faith.

01:24:22.010 --> 01:24:26.010
Therefore, let us briefly look at these two concerns

01:24:26.010 --> 01:24:28.010
that might impact our generosity

01:24:28.010 --> 01:24:31.010
and how faith can help us.

01:24:31.010 --> 01:24:34.010
Now, the first concern was the uncertainty

01:24:34.010 --> 01:24:36.010
of our own future needs.

01:24:36.010 --> 01:24:41.010
Please let us open our Bible to 1 Corinthians 16.

01:24:41.010 --> 01:24:43.010
Here in our theme scripture,

01:24:43.010 --> 01:24:44.010
the Apostle Paul,

01:24:44.010 --> 01:24:46.010
provides a principle to follow

01:24:46.010 --> 01:24:48.010
when we consider donations.

01:24:48.010 --> 01:24:50.010
This is 1 Corinthians 16,

01:24:50.010 --> 01:24:53.010
and we read verse 2.

01:24:53.010 --> 01:24:56.010
On the first day of every week,

01:24:56.010 --> 01:24:59.010
each of you should set something aside

01:24:59.010 --> 01:25:01.010
according to his own means

01:25:01.010 --> 01:25:03.010
so that collections will not take place

01:25:03.010 --> 01:25:05.010
when I arrive.

01:25:05.010 --> 01:25:08.010
So the Apostle Paul encouraged Christians

01:25:08.010 --> 01:25:10.010
to plan ahead to give.

01:25:10.010 --> 01:25:12.010
In other words, Paul wanted them

01:25:12.010 --> 01:25:14.010
to consider their circumstances

01:25:14.010 --> 01:25:17.010
and to decide on a certain contribution amount.

01:25:17.010 --> 01:25:19.010
Paul was convinced

01:25:19.010 --> 01:25:21.010
that this would not result

01:25:21.010 --> 01:25:23.010
in their lacking material necessities.

01:25:23.010 --> 01:25:25.010
He himself had experienced

01:25:25.010 --> 01:25:26.010
not from Jehovah,

01:25:26.010 --> 01:25:30.010
and he knew that God would care for them.

01:25:30.010 --> 01:25:33.010
Generous giving would further allow Jehovah

01:25:33.010 --> 01:25:37.420
to care for them in a generous way.

01:25:37.420 --> 01:25:39.420
Do we now see how planning ahead

01:25:39.420 --> 01:25:42.420
is an expression of our faith?

01:25:42.420 --> 01:25:43.420
When we do this,

01:25:43.420 --> 01:25:46.420
we are putting Jehovah to the test in a good way.

01:25:46.420 --> 01:25:48.420
We want to experience how it feels

01:25:48.420 --> 01:25:51.420
when Jehovah sees us setting the right priorities

01:25:51.420 --> 01:25:54.420
and in turn becomes our protector

01:25:54.420 --> 01:25:57.420
and our rewarder.

01:25:57.420 --> 01:25:59.420
Dear brothers and sisters,

01:25:59.420 --> 01:26:02.420
you are displaying this kind of faith.

01:26:02.420 --> 01:26:04.420
Many of you set something aside

01:26:04.420 --> 01:26:05.420
so that you can contribute

01:26:05.420 --> 01:26:08.420
when you come to the Kingdom Hall.

01:26:08.420 --> 01:26:10.420
Others consider their expenses

01:26:10.420 --> 01:26:11.420
and their financial means

01:26:11.420 --> 01:26:15.420
and they decide to regularly donate electronically.

01:26:15.420 --> 01:26:18.420
Even when circumstances have not allowed you

01:26:18.420 --> 01:26:20.420
to donate the way you've done in the past,

01:26:20.420 --> 01:26:24.420
you still find a way to give your contribution to Jehovah.

01:26:24.420 --> 01:26:29.420
Jehovah promised to care for our needs.

01:26:29.420 --> 01:26:32.420
Do we really believe that?

01:26:32.420 --> 01:26:34.420
If we do,

01:26:34.420 --> 01:26:39.420
our faith will help us to give generously.

01:26:39.420 --> 01:26:41.420
There was a second concern

01:26:41.420 --> 01:26:43.420
that might hold us back from giving generously.

01:26:43.420 --> 01:26:45.420
We might consider our circumstances

01:26:45.420 --> 01:26:48.420
and feel that the contribution we can make

01:26:48.420 --> 01:26:53.420
is so small that it makes no difference.

01:26:53.420 --> 01:26:57.420
Do you still have 1 Corinthians 16 verse 2 open?

01:26:57.420 --> 01:26:58.420
What did we read there?

01:26:58.420 --> 01:27:00.420
Let us read it again.

01:27:00.420 --> 01:27:04.420
1 Corinthians 16 verse 2.

01:27:04.420 --> 01:27:06.420
On the first day of every week,

01:27:06.420 --> 01:27:10.420
each of you should set something aside

01:27:10.420 --> 01:27:14.420
according to his own means.

01:27:14.420 --> 01:27:16.420
Did you notice Paul did not specify

01:27:16.420 --> 01:27:19.420
a certain minimum amount?

01:27:19.420 --> 01:27:20.420
And later,

01:27:20.420 --> 01:27:22.420
he mentioned that Macedonian Christians

01:27:22.420 --> 01:27:25.420
were in the poverty

01:27:25.420 --> 01:27:29.420
yet they backed for the privilege of giving.

01:27:29.420 --> 01:27:31.420
They were happy to give

01:27:31.420 --> 01:27:33.420
even beyond their means

01:27:33.420 --> 01:27:37.420
because they were giving to Jehovah.

01:27:37.420 --> 01:27:39.420
Being poor meant

01:27:39.420 --> 01:27:42.420
that they individually could not give much

01:27:42.420 --> 01:27:44.420
and yet they understood

01:27:44.420 --> 01:27:46.420
that giving materially

01:27:46.420 --> 01:27:50.420
is an expression of our worship.

01:27:50.420 --> 01:27:52.420
Many of you brothers and sisters

01:27:52.420 --> 01:27:54.420
are like those in Macedonia.

01:27:54.420 --> 01:27:56.420
You have very little

01:27:56.420 --> 01:27:58.420
and yet we see your faith

01:27:58.420 --> 01:28:00.420
by contributing generously

01:28:00.420 --> 01:28:03.420
according to your circumstances.

01:28:03.420 --> 01:28:07.420
No matter how small the amount might be,

01:28:07.420 --> 01:28:11.420
you imitate our generous God Jehovah.

01:28:11.420 --> 01:28:13.420
And you experience

01:28:13.420 --> 01:28:15.420
what one sister described in a letter.

01:28:15.420 --> 01:28:17.420
She wrote,

01:28:17.420 --> 01:28:19.420
all these years

01:28:19.420 --> 01:28:21.420
I have been unable to give

01:28:21.420 --> 01:28:23.420
but small amounts of money

01:28:23.420 --> 01:28:25.420
at the Kingdom Hall.

01:28:25.420 --> 01:28:27.420
Yet she continued,

01:28:27.420 --> 01:28:30.420
Jehovah God has given me back

01:28:30.420 --> 01:28:33.420
much more than I have given.

01:28:33.420 --> 01:28:39.189
Even our young children

01:28:39.189 --> 01:28:42.189
can learn to set something aside

01:28:42.189 --> 01:28:44.189
and give to Jehovah here

01:28:44.189 --> 01:28:46.189
for more weeks.

01:28:46.189 --> 01:28:48.189
We occasionally receive notes

01:28:48.189 --> 01:28:50.189
and letters from these young ones

01:28:50.189 --> 01:28:52.189
who want to give to Jehovah

01:28:52.189 --> 01:28:54.189
and they tell us how they appreciate

01:28:54.189 --> 01:28:56.189
what the organization is doing,

01:28:56.189 --> 01:28:58.189
especially the videos.

01:28:58.189 --> 01:29:01.189
This really touches our heart

01:29:01.189 --> 01:29:03.189
and we can only imagine

01:29:03.189 --> 01:29:07.600
how happy it must make Jehovah.

01:29:07.600 --> 01:29:09.600
Jehovah loves us

01:29:09.600 --> 01:29:12.600
forgiving the best that we have.

01:29:12.600 --> 01:29:15.600
We values even our small contributions.

01:29:15.600 --> 01:29:18.600
Even smaller nations do make a difference

01:29:18.600 --> 01:29:21.600
and are noticed by Jehovah.

01:29:21.600 --> 01:29:24.600
He sees our faith in action.

01:29:24.600 --> 01:29:26.600
In the following video,

01:29:26.600 --> 01:29:28.600
note what moved one couple

01:29:28.600 --> 01:29:38.600
to greater acts of generosity.

01:29:38.600 --> 01:29:40.600
When a disaster struck

01:29:40.600 --> 01:29:42.600
in the north of the country,

01:29:42.600 --> 01:29:45.600
we immediately answered the call for help.

01:29:45.600 --> 01:29:47.600
Seeing our brothers and sisters

01:29:47.600 --> 01:29:49.600
in need was heartbreaking.

01:29:49.600 --> 01:30:06.300
But what really touched our heart

01:30:06.300 --> 01:30:09.300
was the spirit of the local brothers and sisters.

01:30:09.300 --> 01:30:11.300
They were like the Macedonians.

01:30:11.300 --> 01:30:13.300
They didn't have much,

01:30:13.300 --> 01:30:36.039
but they gave generously from the heart.

01:30:36.039 --> 01:30:38.039
When we got home,

01:30:38.039 --> 01:30:40.039
Madeline and I resolved to show

01:30:40.039 --> 01:30:42.039
the same kind of spirit.

01:30:42.039 --> 01:30:48.340
First, our appreciation

01:30:48.340 --> 01:30:50.340
led us to review our contribution

01:30:50.340 --> 01:30:52.340
to the worldwide work.

01:30:52.340 --> 01:30:54.340
I've come up with this figure.

01:30:54.340 --> 01:30:55.340
Is this right?

01:30:55.340 --> 01:31:03.350
Yes.

01:31:03.350 --> 01:31:05.350
That's just like Jehovah.

01:31:05.350 --> 01:31:14.100
We looked for ways to be generous

01:31:14.100 --> 01:31:16.100
to those around us.

01:31:16.100 --> 01:31:29.979
We discovered that we had the means to give more,

01:31:29.979 --> 01:31:53.430
so we didn't hold back.

01:31:53.430 --> 01:31:55.430
And then our congregation was invited

01:31:55.430 --> 01:32:05.699
to help with a special preaching campaign.

01:32:05.699 --> 01:32:07.699
I think we could do a bit more.

01:32:07.699 --> 01:32:09.699
Could we push ourselves a bit further?

01:32:09.699 --> 01:32:10.699
I'd really like to.

01:32:10.699 --> 01:32:13.699
It was within our power to help.

01:32:13.699 --> 01:32:16.699
And that's exactly what we did.

01:32:16.699 --> 01:32:21.739
I'm begging too much.

01:32:21.739 --> 01:32:23.739
No, of course not.

01:32:23.739 --> 01:32:40.819
Did you notice what role faith played

01:32:40.819 --> 01:32:42.819
in this couple's giving?

01:32:42.819 --> 01:32:43.819
For example,

01:32:43.819 --> 01:32:46.819
they put their faith in Jehovah's promise

01:32:46.819 --> 01:32:48.819
to care for them in times of need.

01:32:48.819 --> 01:32:49.819
And so,

01:32:49.819 --> 01:32:51.819
they sat down and reconsider

01:32:51.819 --> 01:32:54.819
their ability to generously give.

01:32:54.819 --> 01:32:58.819
Prayerfully, they decided on their contribution.

01:32:58.819 --> 01:33:00.819
In line with our theme,

01:33:00.819 --> 01:33:03.819
they set something aside.

01:33:03.819 --> 01:33:05.819
Additionally,

01:33:05.819 --> 01:33:06.819
they shared materially

01:33:06.819 --> 01:33:08.819
with their brothers and sisters,

01:33:08.819 --> 01:33:09.819
food items,

01:33:09.819 --> 01:33:11.819
and a nice meal.

01:33:11.819 --> 01:33:13.819
They realized what a blessing it is

01:33:13.819 --> 01:33:15.819
to be used by Jehovah

01:33:15.819 --> 01:33:17.819
in caring for others.

01:33:17.819 --> 01:33:21.189
Brothers and sisters,

01:33:21.189 --> 01:33:23.189
we live in the most exciting time in history

01:33:23.189 --> 01:33:26.189
with never to be repeated opportunities

01:33:26.189 --> 01:33:29.189
to demonstrate our faith.

01:33:30.189 --> 01:33:33.189
It was Nepal compared this with a large door

01:33:33.189 --> 01:33:35.189
that opened up.

01:33:35.189 --> 01:33:38.189
Please think for a moment.

01:33:38.189 --> 01:33:41.189
Has the door to activity opened for you

01:33:41.189 --> 01:33:43.189
to learn a new language?

01:33:43.189 --> 01:33:45.189
Or does it look more like the door

01:33:45.189 --> 01:33:49.189
leads you to move to where the need is greater?

01:33:49.189 --> 01:33:51.189
Did this symposium remind you of the door

01:33:51.189 --> 01:33:54.189
that is open for you to receive training

01:33:54.189 --> 01:33:58.189
at the School for Kingdom Evangelizers?

01:33:58.189 --> 01:34:00.189
Or did it direct you to the door

01:34:00.189 --> 01:34:04.189
for assisting with a theoretical building project?

01:34:04.189 --> 01:34:06.189
And maybe this concluding part

01:34:06.189 --> 01:34:08.189
has reminded all of us

01:34:08.189 --> 01:34:11.189
of our privilege of generously supporting the Kingdom work

01:34:11.189 --> 01:34:13.189
by making donations,

01:34:13.189 --> 01:34:17.819
even if they are small.

01:34:17.819 --> 01:34:20.819
What door is open to you

01:34:20.819 --> 01:34:23.819
so that you are able to expand your ministry?

01:34:23.819 --> 01:34:26.819
Don't feel bad if you hesitate to end up

01:34:26.819 --> 01:34:27.819
this is normal,

01:34:27.819 --> 01:34:28.819
and yet please,

01:34:28.819 --> 01:34:32.819
do not delay entering unnecessarily.

01:34:32.819 --> 01:34:35.819
Don't think you can always reach out later.

01:34:35.819 --> 01:34:38.819
We all do not know what our life will be like tomorrow.

01:34:38.819 --> 01:34:39.819
In other words,

01:34:39.819 --> 01:34:41.819
the door to wonderful blessings

01:34:41.819 --> 01:34:43.819
that is open today

01:34:43.819 --> 01:34:46.819
might be close tomorrow.

01:34:46.819 --> 01:34:48.819
So be courageous

01:34:48.819 --> 01:34:52.819
and enter the door to activity in faith.

01:34:52.819 --> 01:34:54.819
And like many of your brothers and sisters

01:34:54.819 --> 01:34:57.819
who already made these steps in the past,

01:34:57.819 --> 01:35:00.819
you will have no regrets.

01:35:00.819 --> 01:35:02.819
Let us all demonstrate our faith

01:35:02.819 --> 01:35:04.819
by doing all that we can

01:35:04.819 --> 01:35:07.819
for our friend and God, Jehovah.

01:35:07.819 --> 01:35:11.819
And we will enjoy a rich life now

01:35:11.819 --> 01:35:15.819
and will be blessed with an ending life in the future.

01:35:17.739 --> 01:35:18.739
Thank you, brothers,

01:35:18.739 --> 01:35:20.739
for those practical suggestions

01:35:20.739 --> 01:35:25.699
on expanding our activity.

01:35:25.699 --> 01:35:27.699
Let's sing a song that reflects our desire

01:35:27.699 --> 01:35:30.699
to do all we can in Jehovah's service.

01:35:30.699 --> 01:35:33.699
Song number 84 is entitled

01:35:33.699 --> 01:35:35.699
reaching out

01:35:35.699 --> 01:35:37.699
that song number 84.
