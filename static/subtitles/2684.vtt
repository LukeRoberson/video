WEBVTT

00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:04.500
How blessed we are in Jehovah's organization,

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.199
to have so many men and women, both young and old,

00:00:08.199 --> 00:00:14.099
who want to use their lives to serve Jehovah with a whole heart.

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.100
The Bible commends that wonderful spirit.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.800
For example, at 1 Timothy chapter 3 and verse 1,

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.600
the Apostle Paul said,

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.899
if a man is reaching out to be an overseer,

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:31.699
he is desirous of a fine work.

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:33.299
Now commenting on this,

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:38.000
the May 15th, 2010 watchtower made this comment.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.899
It said,

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:43.899
a Christian man does not automatically become an overseer.

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:48.399
He must reach out for this fine work.

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:52.100
It includes serving fellow believers

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.200
by genuinely caring for their needs.

00:00:56.299 --> 00:01:00.100
A man who reaches out with proper motives

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.600
is not ambitious.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.799
Instead, he is filled with an unselfish desire

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.099
to benefit others.

00:01:10.099 --> 00:01:15.299
Well, we constantly need more brothers and sisters

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.099
who have that unselfish desire to want to serve others.

00:01:20.099 --> 00:01:21.900
We need more pioneers.

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.200
We need more missionaries.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.299
We need more circuit overseers.

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:27.000
We need more Bethelites.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.700
We need more elders and ministerial servants

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.500
and construction volunteers.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.299
The list just goes on and on.

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:38.000
That means that each one of us

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.099
need to constantly be considering

00:01:41.099 --> 00:01:45.299
what we can do to be of greater use to Jehovah

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.500
and to our brothers and sisters.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.599
Now this raises a question.

00:01:49.599 --> 00:01:52.400
What is the most important thing

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.000
that we need to grow spiritually?

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Well, what about knowledge?

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.099
Is knowledge the most important thing we need?

00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:03.000
Well, first Corinthians chapter eight

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.700
and verse one says,

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.700
knowledge puffs up

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.500
but love builds up.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.500
So we need to have knowledge

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.300
but it's not the most important thing.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.400
When Melinda Kiefer talked to Brother Russell

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.300
in 1907 about her desire

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.699
to enter the full time service,

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:25.199
she said that she felt that

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:27.300
she needed to gain more knowledge

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.300
before she could do that.

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.800
In fact, it was just the preceding year

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.699
that she had received literature of the Bible students.

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:38.000
But how did Brother Russell reply?

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.699
Here's what he said.

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:42.400
If you want to wait until you know it all,

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.400
you'll never get started

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.599
but you'll learn as you go along.

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:49.300
How true?

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.000
Well, is it faith or hope?

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.699
Well, we certainly need faith.

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:56.400
Hebrews 11 verse six says,

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.900
without faith it is impossible

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.599
to please God well.

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:05.599
And we certainly need hope.

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:08.400
Hebrews chapter six and verse 19 says

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.500
that our hope is an anchor for the soul

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.000
both sure and firm.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.699
But what is the greatest thing

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:22.400
that we need to grow spiritually

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.500
and be of greater use to our brothers and sisters?

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:26.500
Let's read it.

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:32.710
Let's go to 1 Corinthians chapter 13

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:37.409
and let's look here at verse 13.

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:38.009
It says,

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:40.810
now however, these three remain.

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.710
Faith, hope, love.

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:46.909
But the greatest of these

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:48.710
is love.

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:51.610
Now why is it that love

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.210
is the most important thing that we need

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:57.810
in order for in order to grow spiritually?

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.710
Well, it's because of what we read in our text this morning

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:03.310
at first John 4.8.

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.909
God is love.

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:08.909
Now commenting on this verse,

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:13.310
the June 1st 2002 watchtower made this comment.

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:14.009
It said,

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:17.810
so intense, so pure,

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.009
so perfect is God's love.

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:26.610
So thoroughly does it permeate his personality and actions

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.610
that it may rightly be spoken of,

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:31.209
that he may rightly be spoken of

00:04:31.209 --> 00:04:35.910
as the very personification of love.

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:39.810
Everything, everything that Jehovah does

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.709
is guided by love.

00:04:42.709 --> 00:04:46.410
So it's impossible for us to imitate Jehovah.

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.709
It's impossible for us to grow spiritually

00:04:49.709 --> 00:04:53.910
and it's impossible for us to be of use to Jehovah

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:57.009
if we are not motivated by love.

00:04:57.009 --> 00:05:01.410
In fact, the apostle Paul said in 1 Corinthians chapter 16

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:02.810
and verse 14,

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:08.009
let everything you do be done with love.

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:12.009
Well, Christian men and women who have that spirit

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:16.310
who are truly motivated and guided by love

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:19.410
are truly useful to our God Jehovah.

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:23.009
In fact, in Ephesians chapter 4,

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:27.110
the apostle Paul spoke about those who were gifts and men.

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:28.610
Now let's look at this together.

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:32.629
Ephesians chapter 4

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:37.129
and let's go to verse 11.

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:40.029
So here Paul lists off some of the assignments

00:05:40.029 --> 00:05:41.129
that these ones were given.

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:44.430
He says, and he gave some as apostles,

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:48.629
some as prophets, some as evangelizers,

00:05:48.629 --> 00:05:52.230
some as shepherds and teachers,

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:55.430
with a view to the readjustment of the holy ones

00:05:55.430 --> 00:06:00.430
for ministerial work to build up the body of the Christ.

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:03.629
Well, now we hear we heard there

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:06.230
a number of different assignments

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:08.930
within God's organization.

00:06:09.029 --> 00:06:11.529
But now how did these various ones

00:06:11.529 --> 00:06:15.129
come to have these assignments?

00:06:15.129 --> 00:06:16.529
Well, there's a clue.

00:06:16.529 --> 00:06:19.329
If you go down to verse 15, look what it says.

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:22.730
But speaking the truth,

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:25.529
let us, do you notice?

00:06:25.529 --> 00:06:30.529
Let us by love grow up in all things

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:35.430
into him who is the head Christ.

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:38.129
And then look at what it says at the end of verse 16.

00:06:39.129 --> 00:06:43.129
When each respective member functions properly,

00:06:43.129 --> 00:06:46.129
this contributes to the growth of the body

00:06:46.129 --> 00:06:50.129
as it builds itself up in love.

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:52.529
So now what's the point?

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:58.629
Spiritual growth has to take place in love

00:06:58.629 --> 00:07:00.129
and through love.

00:07:00.129 --> 00:07:02.730
That's why those brothers were appointed

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:04.829
to those responsibilities.

00:07:04.829 --> 00:07:08.029
They had that proper motivation.

00:07:08.129 --> 00:07:13.129
They were growing in love for God and their brothers.

00:07:13.129 --> 00:07:16.430
Well, otherwise, if that's not the case,

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:17.930
what happens?

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:20.930
Well, look at what the Apostle Paul said

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:24.029
in 1 Corinthians chapter 13.

00:07:24.029 --> 00:07:28.709
And this time, let's read those first three verses.

00:07:28.709 --> 00:07:31.209
1 Corinthians 13, verse 1.

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:35.709
If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels

00:07:35.709 --> 00:07:37.910
but do not have love,

00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:42.209
I have become a clanging gong or a clashing symbol.

00:07:43.209 --> 00:07:45.709
And if I have the gift of prophecy

00:07:45.709 --> 00:07:50.610
and understand all the sacred secrets and all knowledge,

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:54.509
and if I have all the faith so as to move mountains

00:07:55.509 --> 00:07:59.509
but do not have love, I am nothing.

00:08:00.509 --> 00:08:03.709
And if I give all my belongings to feed others

00:08:03.709 --> 00:08:07.410
and if I hand over my body so that I may boast

00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:12.209
but do not have love, I do not benefit at all.

00:08:13.509 --> 00:08:15.209
Well, what's the point?

00:08:15.209 --> 00:08:18.709
You see, Jehovah wants people who are not trying

00:08:18.709 --> 00:08:23.410
to impress other people who are not motivated

00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:27.709
by a desire to gain some privilege or some position.

00:08:27.709 --> 00:08:32.710
He wants people who love him with their whole heart

00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:36.309
and who have that same love for other people

00:08:36.309 --> 00:08:40.210
that both he and his son constantly manifest.

00:08:41.409 --> 00:08:46.409
Brother Valodia in Ukraine is an elder and a regular pioneer.

00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:51.110
Now, he along with nine other brothers

00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:54.710
volunteer to deliver food and medication

00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:58.509
to their fellow believers in one of the major cities there.

00:08:58.509 --> 00:09:00.610
Now, people in that city at this time

00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:04.809
are totally dependent on humanitarian aid

00:09:04.909 --> 00:09:08.409
because the shops and the drug stores are literally empty.

00:09:09.409 --> 00:09:12.610
They also bring gasoline to the local brothers

00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:15.909
who use their cars to help other brothers in that city,

00:09:16.809 --> 00:09:18.610
risking their lives.

00:09:18.610 --> 00:09:23.610
These 10 brothers travel to that city two or three times a week

00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:27.610
depending on when the heavy bombardment is occurring.

00:09:28.309 --> 00:09:32.309
They provide the brothers with their daily necessities

00:09:32.309 --> 00:09:35.909
and they also transport those who want to leave the area.

00:09:36.909 --> 00:09:39.909
Valodia says this, I'm not special.

00:09:41.009 --> 00:09:44.909
We're just helping one another and we feel Jehovah's support.

00:09:46.809 --> 00:09:50.009
What an amazing thing brothers and sisters it is

00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:52.309
to be one of Jehovah's witnesses

00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:56.610
and to be surrounded by men and women

00:09:56.710 --> 00:10:01.009
who are motivated by their deep love for Jehovah

00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:04.710
and an unselfish desire to serve others.

00:10:05.809 --> 00:10:11.509
May we each search for ways that we can grow by love

00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:15.009
into more and more useful tools

00:10:15.509 --> 00:10:19.809
in the hand of our marvelous, our amazing God, Jehovah.
