00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:20.109
At Acts 1 verse 8, Jesus foretold that the good news would be preached to the most distant

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:22.550
part of the earth.

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:30.269
In recent years, digital technology has greatly enhanced our global preaching work as well

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.950
as our Christian meetings.

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:40.429
More videos and digital publications are being produced by Jehovah's Witnesses than ever

00:00:40.429 --> 00:00:42.429
before.

00:00:42.429 --> 00:00:51.469
However, in some parts of the earth, our brothers and sisters have great difficulty accessing

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:58.359
this spiritual food.

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:03.840
If it is the monthly JW broadcast file, it will not download during the day.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.939
Basically, the speed is the main challenge.

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:13.299
Internet connectivity is better at night.

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:23.219
It will be easier to download the material if our stay-up late.

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:26.219
Internet data bundles are very expensive.

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:30.540
Sometimes we may buy them at 1 or 2,000 MW.

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.540
This is a lot of money.

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.140
Sometimes we weren't able to download the required publications because our priority

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.489
was to provide food for the family.

00:01:41.489 --> 00:01:48.450
It was difficult to have meaningful family worship because we didn't have videos to use.

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:57.030
In other words, we can say that we couldn't increase our intake of spiritual food.

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:03.629
The difficulty in the town of Lissala, where we live, is that the network is very bad.

00:02:03.629 --> 00:02:06.310
There are many artiges.

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:12.830
To get the publications and videos, I talked to a brother who was traveling to Kinshasa.

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.870
I gave him my tablet.

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:20.229
Now, imagine three weeks with no study publications and no videos.

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:25.030
I felt like I was working in vain.

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:32.229
To address these challenges, the governing body has lovingly provided a sample yet a

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:34.750
effective solution.

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.550
So this is it, JW Box.

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:42.229
It's innovative, affordable, and it can be set up in less than a minute.

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:48.030
You've connected to a USB device which is preloaded with our videos and publications.

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.750
And then you plug this into an external power source like a battery.

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:57.110
And then the brothers, they can use their personal devices to connect to it over Wi-Fi.

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.909
And because it's a local connection, it's fast.

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:09.830
The branch office preloads JW Boxes with approved content already publicly available on

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:18.069
JWU.org and JWU Library and then distributes them to the local congregations.

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:21.870
They're also used at assemblies and conventions.

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:28.150
At one convention, publishers downloaded a newly released New World Translation in their

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.870
language right at the convention site.

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:39.710
To keep the digital content up to date, the branch downloads new videos and digital publications

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:42.710
onto USB keys.

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:51.009
Local congregations receive these keys along with their literature shipment.

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:57.530
The materials we use for family worship have strengthened our family bond.

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.250
They make it easier for us to help our girls.

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:05.449
It makes it easier for them to give comments after watching the videos for the meetings.

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:10.729
Only watch the videos and say, Daddy, I want to make a contribution at the Kingdom Home.

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:15.129
That lets me know that the video touched her heart.

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:17.170
The videos have helped us a lot.

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:22.250
For example, at first it was very difficult for our child to learn songs from our songbook,

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.850
but because of the videos, it's easy for her.

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:31.410
Now our relationship with Jehovah is stronger, including with our family and our children.

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.290
I used my phone in the film industry and at the meetings.

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:38.649
And I used it to show videos to my friends at school.

00:04:38.649 --> 00:04:42.730
I started studying with them because of these videos.

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:47.250
So the videos that I showed them helped me to reach their hearts.

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:52.009
In my film service reports, I would leave the video section empty, but now it's no longer

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:53.009
empty.

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:54.930
I report many videos.

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:59.370
The people I started the Bible with are very interested in them and I now have several

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:03.290
studies because they like to watch these videos.

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:07.009
J.W. Box has been a great help to our family.

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:11.329
Because of the publications and videos we can download now.

00:05:11.329 --> 00:05:18.610
Our children are learning from the lessons shown in the Caleb and Sophia videos.

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:24.850
We appreciate this provision so much because it helps to get spiritual food into the

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:27.850
hands and the hearts of our brothers.
