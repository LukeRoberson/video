00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:08.640
During my time, the various years that I served as UN special rapporteur for freedom of

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:12.880
religion and belief, I've always been in touch with Joe with witnesses, including when

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:19.440
undertaking country-specific fact-finding missions because Joe with witnesses are one of

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:26.440
the communities very much under threat, but with little public attention giving to their

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:32.759
situation. So it's all the more important that we become aware of the dramas unfolding

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:40.359
there. I mean, if you have a look at the legislation extremism, everyone seems to agree,

00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:47.000
yeah, it's important that we combat extremist tendencies, but it remains totally undefined,

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:55.640
so really serving as a proxy, as an entry point, as an excuse for whatever the authorities

00:00:55.719 --> 00:01:03.399
wish to do. And Joe with witnesses have been the ideal scape quote, because many people

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.120
feel a bit suspicious because Joe with witnesses are active, they do missionary work, not

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.760
everyone likes it, even though it's totally peaceful, in exercise of their freedom of

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:17.879
a literal belief. If Joe with witnesses are extremists, I think we all are. I mean, this is really

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:25.879
the example of a legislation which is so vaguely circumscribed that it really gives the

00:01:25.879 --> 00:01:33.480
authorities carte blanche to go after wherever they wish. It creates a climate of intimidation

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:38.280
of threat, and of course it goes against the spirit and the letter of human rights.

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.799
So people in Russia, but also the international community, really have to pay a lot of attention

00:01:44.519 --> 00:01:50.200
to what is going on there. This is really something where also Russian citizens, all of them

00:01:50.680 --> 00:02:00.200
are concerned, because the more the space for minorities will be shrinking, the more democracy

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:07.959
itself will in the end be at risk. Either we have the space where freedom of religion or belief

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:15.400
can manifest itself free from coercion, free from intimidation, free from absurd threats in the

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:22.599
name of fighting extremism, or the space will shrink more and more. And this is something we have

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:32.360
observed in many countries. So any particular religious community being targeted scapegoated

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:38.360
by the state will shrink the space for all. So it's also in the interest of other religious

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:45.879
communities, including the majority, to have that space for the free articulation of faith,

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:52.439
because only free articulation of faith is authentic faith. So in the end, this is also in the

00:02:52.439 --> 00:03:02.439
interest of the majority, even though not everyone may see it that way.
