00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.620
It was when my husband was really opposed.

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:11.619
One night, he put a knife to his stomach and said,

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:15.619
will you choose me or the truth?

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.620
My husband was cooperative.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.620
He would wave goodbyes we went to the meetings.

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:27.620
But he wasn't interested at all.

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:34.619
I felt really jealous when I saw families sitting together at assemblies.

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:43.090
Because of work and taking care of his mother, my husband gradually started missing meetings.

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:49.090
Some in our congregation, with good intentions, pointed it out to him.

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:55.090
But the way they did this made him feel misunderstood and discouraged.

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.090
And he put the Bible and the publications away.

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:04.090
I also had times when I wanted to drift away with him.

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.230
I was really happy when I learned the truth.

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:17.230
In my zeal, I bombarded my husband with information and that made him worry that I had turned into a fanatic.

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:25.480
I think he was genuinely concerned for his family and thought that I had joined a weird religion.

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:32.299
One family in the congregation often invited us to meals and outdoor activities.

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.299
I think my husband appreciated those small acts of kindness.

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:43.299
I also tried to show that I appreciated him through my speech and conduct.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:52.840
When my children and I applied what we learned in our lives, I think he gradually became interested in the truth.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.840
The words, safeguard your heart, caught my eye.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:05.840
I decided to try and keep my heart and my children's hearts towards Jehovah.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:14.840
When I went out in the ministry with my children, I would point out various aspects of God's creation around us.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:22.840
And before my husband would come home from work, I made it a habit to teach them God's word.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.840
I made a conscious effort to see myself in paradise with my husband.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.840
This strengthened my resolve to never leave the truth.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.840
I wrote caring notes to my husband when I went to the meetings.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.840
I was convinced that he would come back one day.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.840
And he did come back.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.840
I did not leave Jehovah and so Jehovah never abandoned me.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.840
My husband never embraced the truth.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.840
However, right now, all five of my children are in the truth.

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.840
And I feel really blessed.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:17.840
Being able to serve Jehovah as a family, along with my husband, the joy and appreciation just keep dwelling up.
