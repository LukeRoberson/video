00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:05.589
Worrying doesn't help us.

00:00:05.589 --> 00:00:08.789
No need really to worry what could happen.

00:00:08.789 --> 00:00:11.789
Even if it happens, let Jehovah show

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:14.029
how he can handle the situation.

00:00:14.029 --> 00:00:18.030
He can actually do it in ways you could never expect.

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:21.829
We are Yusuf and Paulina Halme.

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:24.230
We loved our assignment in Finland branch.

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.269
We had a wonderful friends.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.070
Our families, they were very close.

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.910
We had a time to be with them often.

00:00:32.869 --> 00:00:36.149
In 2014, we got the yearbook

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.630
and that had an account of Sierra Leone.

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:41.670
And I was reading that account

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.350
and I remember saying a couple of times to Paulina,

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:45.990
this would be a tough place.

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.670
After coming back from Gilead, I couldn't believe it.

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.950
We got a letter saying that we have been reassigned

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:55.310
to Sierra Leone branch.

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:58.509
And it was a huge change for us.

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:02.189
Then what we did, we googled Sierra Leone

00:01:02.189 --> 00:01:06.189
and what we saw, it was only about a civil war

00:01:06.829 --> 00:01:08.750
that took place years ago.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.390
Ebola outbreak was starting in West Africa.

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.269
Some of our relatives were worried about that.

00:01:15.269 --> 00:01:18.989
That was our impression, first impression, about the country.

00:01:18.989 --> 00:01:21.790
We were terrified and we couldn't sleep.

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:23.629
We just prayed whole night.

00:01:23.629 --> 00:01:26.829
And really, with the reassignment our greatest fear

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.390
was my father.

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.909
He had been terminally ill about two years.

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:35.349
And we knew that at some point ill, it will get worse.

00:01:35.349 --> 00:01:38.989
He would need more help and also use his mother.

00:01:38.989 --> 00:01:42.030
So are we able to travel back to Finland?

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.989
It's so expensive and we didn't have savings.

00:01:44.989 --> 00:01:47.829
So although we have all those fears,

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:50.829
after praying about it a lot,

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:53.950
we just realized that we cannot say no.

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.629
And we realized that this assignment is from Jehovah.

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:59.469
Let's go there.

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:00.549
Let's get to the work.

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:02.349
Let's give our best to it.

00:02:03.989 --> 00:02:06.590
Then actually in three months,

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.110
our greatest fear, it came through.

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.229
It really happened that a user's mom,

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:16.590
she called us and she told us that user's father's situation

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:17.789
it has changed.

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:21.469
So we started immediately to check flights.

00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:25.430
And then the next call was that he had passed away.

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.110
We were able to get flights, fly back to home

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.750
and support my mother, help with the funeral.

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:39.590
We were so happy when we finally got back to Sierra Leone

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.830
and now we thought that we can focus to our assignment

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.550
and our work at Bethel.

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.310
Then one day we got another Skype call from my father

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.550
and then he told that he's diagnosed with extremely aggressive cancer

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.389
and he's in hospital now.

00:02:56.389 --> 00:03:02.830
And he asked us to come back to Finland for visit.

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.270
We had a beautiful 10 days together with my father.

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.150
But then finally he passed away.

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.550
Yeah, that was really the lowest point in our life.

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.069
That came out of the clue, we were not expecting it.

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:19.229
We had two videos to take care of.

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:26.159
So we were really thinking if we can continue in our assignment in Sierra Leone.

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:31.159
At that time, one of our favorite scriptures was Isaiah 3015

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:36.159
that your strength will be in keeping calm and showing trust.

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:40.319
And when we poured our hearts to Jehovah in prayer,

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:48.039
we could so well see how Jehovah helped us to stay calm and have peace.

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:51.159
And we got some good advices from much of brothers

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:53.680
not to make any quick decisions.

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.960
So we put our trust to Jehovah

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.520
and we could just see that it was Jehovah's will

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:01.840
that we continue in our assignment in Sierra Leone.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:09.280
The fact is that really the blessings always surpass any of the challenges.

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.240
And we have come to love our assignment in Sierra Leone.

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.519
Our brothers and sisters, they're so faithful in Sierra Leone

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:19.519
despite their problems and challenges.

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:22.399
They give a beautiful example for us.

00:04:22.399 --> 00:04:26.279
Being in the country, where there's a lot of potential, a lot of work.

00:04:26.279 --> 00:04:29.759
You can have as many Bible studies as you can conduct.

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:32.319
So it's just a preaching paradise.

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.000
Going through these experiences,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.399
we are so happy that Jehovah is a writer of our story.

00:04:39.399 --> 00:04:42.360
And for sure, there's a happy end.

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.160
If he wants to take you there, go there.

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:47.560
See what Jehovah has in mind for you.

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.519
And then you can really taste and see that Jehovah is good.
