00:00:01.679 --> 00:00:09.080
Some of us have been in the truth for 40 years, 50 years, 60 years, or more.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:14.679
During our life we may have been confronted with various tests or challenges.

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:24.179
Still, we did not and we do not give up the truth and our precious relationship with our heavenly Father.

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:29.179
Also, we do not give up preaching the Word of God.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:36.280
Second Corinthians chapter 4, 16 is the theme Scripture I selected for this talk.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.880
Please locate that with me.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:44.700
Second Corinthians 4, 16.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.000
It says,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.299
Therefore, we do not give up.

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:52.799
But even if the man we are outside is wasting away,

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:59.560
certainly the man we are inside is being renewed from day to day.

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:03.460
As it said, we do not give up.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.459
And we do not give in when it comes to temptations.

00:01:07.459 --> 00:01:15.459
First Peter 3, 6 encourages us to not give in to fear.

00:01:15.459 --> 00:01:21.359
Deuteronomy 13, 6 tells the Israelites that when a false prophet becomes active,

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:27.340
you must not give in to him or listen to him.

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:31.439
In the sermon on the mount according to an alternate rendering,

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:41.239
Jesus told his listeners to pray to Jehovah to not allow us to give in to temptation.

00:01:41.239 --> 00:01:46.540
On one occasion, Peter encouraged others, quote, first Peter 3, 6,

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.540
Do not give in to fear.

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:55.040
We do give ear when somebody gives us good counsel.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:01.040
We give serious thought when somebody wants to help us.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.340
We give comfort to those in need.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.939
In the first century, Paul gave comfort to the congregation in Corinth.

00:02:09.939 --> 00:02:14.840
Please find second Corinthians 4, 1,

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.639
with me and we can read together.

00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:22.389
And it says there.

00:02:22.389 --> 00:02:26.590
Therefore, since we have this ministry

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:34.020
through the mercy that was shown us, we do not give up.

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.319
So who were the we, the anointed?

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:46.520
Second Corinthians 3, verse 3 tells the Corinthians,

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.819
there was the words of Paul,

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:55.020
that they are like a letter of Christ written by him and his friends as ministers

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:00.120
inscribed with the spirit of our living God.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:06.419
The Apostle then, in verse 5, humbly acknowledges that the fact that he and the Corinthians

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:11.120
were qualified came from God and in verse 6,

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:19.520
that he has adequately qualified Christians to be ministers of a new covenant.

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:23.520
What did Paul refer to when he said in verse 1?

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.719
Since we have this ministry,

00:03:27.719 --> 00:03:34.919
he referred to the ministry of that new covenant of which he was just talking about.

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:42.319
Please follow the reading of 2nd Corinthians chapter 3, verses 5 and 6,

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:44.520
where it says,

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:52.120
not that we ourselves are adequately qualified to consider that anything comes from us,

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.520
but our being adequately qualified comes from God,

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:04.419
who has indeed adequately qualified us to be ministers of a new covenant,

00:04:04.419 --> 00:04:09.830
not of a written code but of spirit.

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:13.629
In 2nd Corinthians 3, 18, he says,

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:20.629
and all of us, while we reflect like mirrors the glory of Jehovah.

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:24.930
Well, who did he refer to when he wrote all of us?

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.529
He meant all of the anointed.

00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:31.329
In chapter 4, verse 1, he says,

00:04:31.329 --> 00:04:38.129
therefore, since we have this ministry through the mercy that was shown us,

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:40.329
the expression, therefore,

00:04:40.329 --> 00:04:48.029
refers back to the reason and motivation for the anointed, not to give up.

00:04:48.029 --> 00:04:57.129
In chapter 3, verse 18, he refers to the anointed as being transformed from one degree of glory to another,

00:04:57.129 --> 00:05:03.029
culminating in the glory they receive when entering heaven.

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:08.430
Since the anointed are progressing from glory to glory until going to heaven,

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:14.629
they have a strong motivation not to give up, but endure.

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:20.730
Since there is such a precious price or reward ahead of them,

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:26.029
understandably, Paul said in chapter 4, verse 1,

00:05:26.029 --> 00:05:30.329
therefore, we do not give up.

00:05:30.329 --> 00:05:34.430
Also in 2nd Corinthians 4, 16, Paul wrote,

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:38.870
therefore, we do not give up.

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:45.069
In the 3rd chapter, Paul contrasts the old covenant that was stripped of glory

00:05:45.069 --> 00:05:48.870
with the new covenant that would, like verse 10 and 11,

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:55.769
says, Excel with greater glory, a glory that would remain.

00:05:55.769 --> 00:05:58.769
In 2nd Corinthians 3, 12, says,

00:05:58.769 --> 00:06:02.170
since we have such a hope,

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:05.569
what hope? The heavenly hope.

00:06:05.569 --> 00:06:09.769
Did you note the similarity with chapter 4, verse 1?

00:06:09.769 --> 00:06:14.769
It said, since we have this ministry.

00:06:14.769 --> 00:06:17.769
What ministry was Paul referring to?

00:06:17.769 --> 00:06:22.370
Was he referring to field ministry in a general sense?

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:28.769
No. He referred to the ministry of the new covenant.

00:06:28.769 --> 00:06:36.370
In chapter 3, verse 7, he then calls the ministry of the new covenant a treasure.

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:40.269
Since we have this treasure, he said,

00:06:40.269 --> 00:06:43.470
not just any treasure.

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:47.569
It was a great incentive for the anointed in the 1st century

00:06:47.569 --> 00:06:52.870
to not give up in view of this treasure of the new covenant

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:56.170
that involves progressive glory.

00:06:56.170 --> 00:07:01.769
Paul wrote, therefore, we do not give up.

00:07:01.769 --> 00:07:05.069
Also the context of the next verses

00:07:05.069 --> 00:07:08.569
shows that Paul was writing about the heavenly calling

00:07:08.569 --> 00:07:12.170
that the new covenant made possible.

00:07:12.269 --> 00:07:17.170
What Paul wrote is a strong incentive for anointed today

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:20.870
to not give up.

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:24.170
What about the great crowd of other sheep?

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:26.970
Paul did not have the great crowd in mind

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:32.470
when he wrote the words of 2nd Corinthians, chapter 3 and 4.

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:35.670
In the introduction to his letter, he referred to

00:07:35.769 --> 00:07:39.269
quote, all the holy ones.

00:07:39.269 --> 00:07:43.769
In 2nd Corinthians 1, 21 and 22, he says,

00:07:43.769 --> 00:07:46.769
quote, who anointed us is God.

00:07:46.769 --> 00:07:51.639
He has also put his seal on us.

00:07:51.639 --> 00:07:56.040
However, the great crowd is a recipient of the radiant blessings

00:07:56.040 --> 00:08:00.139
of the ministry of the new covenant.

00:08:00.139 --> 00:08:03.540
Some time ago, the watchtower made a general application

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:06.740
and principle to the great crowd.

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:10.939
Just like the anointed have the treasure of the new covenant

00:08:10.939 --> 00:08:14.540
and its ministry, the great crowd considers

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:18.540
their ministry also a treasure.

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:22.139
The great crowd is also determined not to give up

00:08:22.139 --> 00:08:25.740
in view of the beautiful hope to live forever

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:28.740
in paradise on earth.

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:34.340
And all of us, no matter what hope, have to endure.

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:38.440
Paul wrote in 2nd Corinthians, chapter 4, verse 8,

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:44.240
that we are hard pressed, some more than others.

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:50.139
Please find Psalm 90 was 10.

00:08:50.139 --> 00:08:53.639
None of us are exempt from the pressures

00:08:53.639 --> 00:08:58.240
that can cause discouragement.

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:00.840
And it says there,

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:03.940
span of our life is 70 years,

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:06.440
or 80 if one is especially strong,

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:10.039
but they are filled with trouble and sorrow.

00:09:10.039 --> 00:09:16.009
They quickly pass by and away we fly.

00:09:16.009 --> 00:09:19.210
Because of the pressures of life and disappointments,

00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:21.909
most of us grow weary at times.

00:09:21.909 --> 00:09:24.710
But we must remember that God never promised

00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:29.309
that we would have a problem-free life in this old system.

00:09:29.309 --> 00:09:31.809
Even in the first century, God's servants faced

00:09:31.809 --> 00:09:36.710
adversities, including persecution and poverty.

00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:42.009
Jehovah does allow his servants to be tempted and tested.

00:09:42.009 --> 00:09:44.509
For the time of the end, he also foretold

00:09:44.509 --> 00:09:49.009
earthquakes, wars, increased lawlessness,

00:09:49.009 --> 00:09:54.210
and pestilences according to Luke 21, 11.

00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:58.509
In Revelation, he foretold that a figurative horseman

00:09:58.509 --> 00:10:03.110
on a pale horse will kill a large amount of people.

00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:05.509
This happened for decades now,

00:10:05.509 --> 00:10:09.710
but started with a Spanish flu at the end of World War I,

00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:14.210
where an estimated 500 million were affected,

00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:17.509
one third of a man kind of that time,

00:10:17.509 --> 00:10:21.509
and about 50 million died.

00:10:21.509 --> 00:10:25.009
Satan exploits our moments of discouragement

00:10:25.009 --> 00:10:27.309
just as a lion takes advantage of an animal

00:10:27.309 --> 00:10:29.809
when it is most vulnerable.

00:10:29.809 --> 00:10:32.909
But we will not give up.

00:10:32.909 --> 00:10:37.009
We will not give up if others disappoint us.

00:10:37.009 --> 00:10:40.210
In Bible times, even the most faithful servants of Jehovah

00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:44.409
may have felt weighed down at times.

00:10:44.409 --> 00:10:49.809
I have grown weary with my sying, wrote David.

00:10:49.809 --> 00:10:53.009
All night long, I make my couch swim

00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:58.210
with my tears I make my own dive-on overflow.

00:10:58.210 --> 00:11:01.309
Why did David feel that way?

00:11:01.309 --> 00:11:07.110
Because of all those showing hostility to me, he explained.

00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:11.110
The hurtful actions of others caused David such pain of heart

00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:13.909
that his tears flowed freely.

00:11:13.909 --> 00:11:17.610
Still, David did not draw away from Jehovah

00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:21.309
because of what fellow humans had done to him.

00:11:21.409 --> 00:11:25.409
And neither do we.

00:11:25.409 --> 00:11:28.409
Similarly, the words or actions of others

00:11:28.409 --> 00:11:31.909
may cause as much pain of heart.

00:11:31.909 --> 00:11:34.210
There exists the one speaking thoughtlessly

00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:40.110
as with the stabs of swords as Proverbs 12, 18.

00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:43.409
When the thoughtless one is a Christian brother or sister,

00:11:43.409 --> 00:11:46.610
the stab wound can go deep.

00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:49.509
The human tendency may be to take offense,

00:11:49.509 --> 00:11:52.509
perhaps harboring resentment.

00:11:52.509 --> 00:11:54.409
This is especially true if we feel

00:11:54.409 --> 00:11:58.909
that we have been treated unkindly or unjustly.

00:11:58.909 --> 00:12:02.409
We may find it hard to talk to the offender.

00:12:02.409 --> 00:12:06.909
We might even deliberately avoid him or her.

00:12:06.909 --> 00:12:11.409
Wait down with resentment, some have given up

00:12:11.409 --> 00:12:15.809
and have stopped coming to Christian meetings.

00:12:15.809 --> 00:12:19.809
How can we avoid playing into the devil's hands

00:12:19.809 --> 00:12:23.210
when others disappoint or hurt us?

00:12:23.210 --> 00:12:26.909
We must try not to harbore resentment.

00:12:26.909 --> 00:12:32.009
It can hurt us so much that we start suffering from depression.

00:12:32.009 --> 00:12:35.710
Instead of giving into depression or aggression,

00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:38.710
take the initiative to make peace

00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:42.710
or settle matters as quickly as possible.

00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:45.710
Colossians 3, 13 urges us,

00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:49.809
continue forgiving one another freely

00:12:49.809 --> 00:12:56.470
if anyone has a cause for a complaint against another.

00:12:56.470 --> 00:12:59.669
We do not have to fall prey to Satan.

00:12:59.669 --> 00:13:03.570
Jehovah and Jesus are on our side.

00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:07.169
How can we find encouragement to endure?

00:13:07.169 --> 00:13:11.470
Jehovah deeply cares about those who may be discouraged.

00:13:11.570 --> 00:13:18.769
Acts 17, 27 shows he is not far off from each one of us.

00:13:18.769 --> 00:13:21.470
Jehovah comforts and strengths of us

00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:26.970
through loving brothers and through his spirit and his word.

00:13:26.970 --> 00:13:32.370
Reading the Bible daily and meditating upon it helps.

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:35.970
The publications have encouraged us to read the Bible

00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:38.669
through once a year.

00:13:38.669 --> 00:13:44.480
Why not make it your resolve to try such a program?

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:48.080
National Dory and anointed brother from Albania

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:51.580
who persevered on the ban said,

00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:56.879
My goal was to read the Bible for at least one hour each day

00:13:56.879 --> 00:14:03.750
which I did for some 60 years before my eyesight failed.

00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:06.350
Was he bragging when saying this?

00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:09.649
No, it helped him not to give up

00:14:09.649 --> 00:14:14.399
under the extreme communist dictatorship.

00:14:14.399 --> 00:14:17.799
We do not necessarily expect you to read the Bible

00:14:17.799 --> 00:14:19.799
for one hour each day,

00:14:19.799 --> 00:14:23.899
but we encourage you to read it through in one year

00:14:23.899 --> 00:14:28.799
and read it slowly enough that you can meditate on it.

00:14:28.799 --> 00:14:32.000
About 20 minutes a day provides ample opportunity

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.500
to read and meditate on what you read.

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:38.399
If you read so you hear your own voice,

00:14:38.399 --> 00:14:44.399
it will help you to read slower and to meditate.

00:14:44.399 --> 00:14:48.000
We also find encouragement through his organization,

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.899
things we read in the literature or magazines

00:14:50.899 --> 00:14:55.600
and we greatly benefit from the congregation meetings.

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:59.799
We also benefit from sweet association with our brothers.

00:14:59.799 --> 00:15:02.600
We live or we are television,

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:07.600
so do not give up.

00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:14.100
When they shepherd also a big help for many to persevere.

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:18.600
Publishers in our congregation do a lot to strengthen us.

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:20.600
According to Hebrews 10.25,

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:25.100
it is God's will that we keep encouraging one another

00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:30.600
and doing so is more urgent now than ever before.

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:37.100
Let us always keep in mind the inspired words of 2 Thessalonians 3.13.

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:44.100
For you apart, brothers, do not give up in doing good.

00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:47.100
Galatians 6.9 similarly says,

00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:51.100
quote, let us not give up in doing what is fine.

00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:55.440
For in due time we will reap.

00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:58.440
What do we conclude from this?

00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:03.440
It is the words of our theme text, 2 Corinthians 4.16.

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:06.440
We do not give up.
