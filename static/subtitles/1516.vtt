This animation depicts what Zechariah may have seen as he approached the entrance to the temple.

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:13.349
Entrance was possible through one the court of women.

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:19.859
Zechariah would have seen two, the altar of burnt offering,

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:41.310
three, the entrance to the holy, and four, the sea of cast metal.

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:46.310
Some sources say that the temple built by Herod was 15 stories high.

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:57.109
Apparently, the facade surrounding the front doors of the temple was plated with gold.

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:11.379
The entrance faced east, so light from the rising sun would have been reflected with dazzling brilliance.
