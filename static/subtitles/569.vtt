00:00:01.649 --> 00:00:07.049
We'd like to read today's text in its entirety from Matthew 1810,

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:13.140
see that you do not despise one of these little ones.

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:20.940
For I tell you that their angels in heaven always look upon the face of my father who is in heaven.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:26.339
Now, we would like to discuss two questions in connection with this text.

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:31.940
First of all, who are these little ones and how does Jesus identify them?

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:37.939
And second, how is Jehovah caring for the little ones of the earth today?

00:00:37.939 --> 00:00:41.939
Well, first, who are the little ones mentioned in our text?

00:00:41.939 --> 00:00:49.439
The book, Jesus the Way, connects Matthew 18 with the accounts in Mark and Luke.

00:00:49.439 --> 00:00:57.439
And in the accounts in Mark and Luke, it explained that before the question that they asked Jesus,

00:00:57.439 --> 00:01:01.439
they had been arguing about who was the greatest.

00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:05.439
So then at Matthew 181, they asked Jesus directly,

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:09.939
who really is the greatest in the kingdom of the heavens?

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:15.939
Well, Jesus used this opportunity to teach them an unforgettable lesson.

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:20.439
He took a young child and stood it in their midst and said,

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:26.939
unless you turn around and become as young children, you will never enter the kingdom.

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:32.439
He used this child as an object lesson to adjust their thinking.

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:37.939
In verse 6, he speaks about these little ones who have faith in me.

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:42.939
And in verse 10, he said, do not despise these little ones.

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:52.439
The 2015 watchtower said that they are those who may seem unimportant from the standpoint of the world.

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:59.439
Now, when Jesus said these things, he was probably pointing to that child who was still in their midst.

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:05.939
And that child represented all humble disciples who put faith in Jesus.

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:15.939
And one reference says to despise the little ones here is to treat them as of no real significance.

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:20.439
Now, immediately after telling the disciples not to despise the little ones,

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:26.439
Jesus gave the touching illustration of a shepherd who had a hundred sheep.

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:31.939
But he does not despise or view as insignificant even one of those sheep.

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:40.439
He searches everywhere for the lost sheep who has strayed from the flock or who hasn't joined the flock yet.

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:47.939
So that leads us to our second question, how is Jehovah caring for little ones of the earth today?

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:57.939
For a few minutes, let's think about how Jehovah has opened the way for little ones on the continent of Africa to become part of his flock.

00:02:57.939 --> 00:03:03.439
Now, Africa is home to about one-third of the world's languages.

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:09.439
And we translate at least some Bible literature in over 350 African languages.

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:15.439
And part of the new world translation is now available in 90 of those languages.

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:19.740
Now, many of those indigenous languages are not taught in school.

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:27.539
In fact, the watchtower is often the only regular source of literature or reading material.

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:34.939
Now, many in Africa who speak the official languages like English, French, Portuguese, or Swahili

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:39.740
tend to view the local indigenous languages as somewhat inferior.

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:46.840
In fact, churches often limit their services to the official or the national languages.

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:57.240
But that's understandable because those who attend a church are usually just passive participants, maybe singing a song or two.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:05.240
But due to educational and economic factors, many millions, and especially those in the rural areas and the villages,

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:11.240
don't know well the official languages, or they may not even know them at all.

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:17.240
But that does not stop Jehovah from finding his sheep who speak those languages.

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:20.240
He draws them to himself.

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:29.240
The governing body recently gave approval to produce the enjoy life forever book in the watchtower magazine in the Havu,

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.240
Kanyok and Kanande languages of Congo.

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:39.240
And listen to how it affects those who hear Jehovah's voice in their own language.

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:47.740
Now, Habakkuk is a Kanande speaking brother who first heard the truth in Swahili, one of the national languages of Congo.

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.740
But he struggled to make progress because he didn't know Swahili well.

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.740
He said, I grew up speaking Kanande.

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:00.240
But I thought it was a sin to speak Kanande at the Kingdom Hall.

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:07.240
When we started having meetings in Kanande, I realized that it was not a sin against Jehovah to speak it.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:13.740
In our territory, people are used to speaking Kanande, and I now have six Bible studies.

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:20.740
I'm thankful to preaching Kanande because I find many people who are interested in learning the Bible.

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:31.740
A Kanyok sister named Kafia said, it was hard for me to progress to baptism in Chaluba, which is another national language of Congo.

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.740
It was not really my language.

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:41.240
But when I saw the listen to God brochure in Kanyok, even the title touched my heart.

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:44.740
I take pleasure in my personal study now.

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:46.740
I feel comfortable praying.

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:50.240
It feels like I'm talking to my father who is listening.

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.740
I progressed to baptism in 2022.

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:58.240
When preaching in Kanyok, I can see the interest of people in my neighborhood.

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:06.240
Often, I hear them say how they now see that God understands their language of Kanyok.

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:11.740
And then finally, Anita, an 18-year-old Havu speaking sister, said,

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:19.740
I started studying in 2020 in Swahili, and I made progress at the speed of a tortoise.

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:27.740
Upon seeing my Bible's teacher arriving, fear would overwhelm me because it was so hard for me to study in Swahili.

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:33.740
When I started studying the Bible and attending meetings in Havu, I was no longer scared.

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:40.740
I enjoyed my Bible study, gave comments at meetings, and recently I was baptized.

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:43.740
My relationship with Jehovah has become strong.

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:52.740
My prayers are deeper now because I tell Jehovah everything in my heart without fear of making mistakes like I did in Swahili.

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:55.740
I am comfortable preaching in Havu.

00:06:55.740 --> 00:07:01.740
I no longer fear that people will laugh at me as was the case in Swahili.

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:16.740
So these are just a few examples, but the thousands of Bible studies being conducted in these and other native languages of Congo testify that Jehovah is giving attention to these little ones.

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:25.740
Now, in addition to these languages, we produce material for the deaf in 22 sign languages of Africa.

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:30.740
And one of the little ones who uses Zimbabwean sign language said,

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:40.740
do not forget to tell the brothers that when we see the work behind the conventions and the enjoy life forever book, this message comes through again and again.

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:45.740
Jehovah loves the deaf. Jehovah loves the deaf.

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:55.740
These few expressions illustrate why we conduct meetings and produce literature in so many languages of Africa as well as other parts of the earth.

00:07:55.740 --> 00:08:00.740
It's evidence that Jehovah is caring for these little ones.

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:09.740
Now, in many of these local and sign language congregations, there are often just hundreds of publishers rather than many thousands.

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:15.740
Translation teams are often quite small, like these Havu and Kanyok teams.

00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:30.740
And obviously they can't produce everything we receive in English, but they work hard because they realize how much their audience needs the basic material they translate in order to come to know Jehovah.

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:43.740
These translators are highly motivated, much like a sister who some years ago was interpreting nearly every talk to a very small deaf audience at an international convention.

00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:50.740
Brother Milton Henshel noticed how hard she was working and he asked one of the brothers, what gives her the stamina?

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:58.740
The reply, one of the deaf sisters in the audience is her mother and she doesn't want her to miss anything of the program.

00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:06.740
Well, our translators in Africa and worldwide feel the same about their audiences.

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:19.740
And we also keep in mind what Jesus said in part B of our text that their angels in heaven always look upon the face of my father who is in heaven.

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:24.740
And the study note on this verse has an interesting statement.

00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:37.740
Jesus' statement about these little ones, namely his disciples and their angels does not necessarily mean that each devoted Christian has a special guardian angel assigned to him.

00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:49.740
But angels are looking out for the spiritual welfare of true Christians as a whole and take an active interest in each of Christ's disciples.

00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:59.740
So we're privileged to work along with these angels and the faithful slave who shared Jesus' view that's stated at the end of today's text comments.

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:08.740
It is not a desirable thing for my father who is in heaven for even one of these little ones to perish.
