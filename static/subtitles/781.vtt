00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:09.369
Well, you brothers and sisters from the 155th class of Gilead are not only about to graduate but will soon be heading toward your

00:00:09.369 --> 00:00:15.429
assignments, which we know you'll enjoy. But life, being what it is, you know,

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:23.489
problems occasionally arise. And one problem you might personally encounter somewhere down the road is

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.989
difficulty understanding and adjustment to an organizational or

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:35.990
theocratic arrangement. It could be a change in our preaching methods, or in congregation

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:43.549
operations, or in branch procedures, or something like that. Now normally we appreciate these

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:51.549
organizational refinements in harmony with Isaiah 67 and yet our publications and even the

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:57.549
Bible itself acknowledged that at some point any one of us might find it hard to make

00:00:57.549 --> 00:01:04.549
that transition from the way we had been doing something to the way we're now instructed

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:11.109
to do it. Now why would we find it difficult? Because it affects us personally. It changes

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:18.109
where we serve or what we do. Maybe that. Maybe not that. Maybe it's just that mentally

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.950
we're finding it hard to grasp the sense behind the change. Well, we're loyal. We're

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:32.950
going to cooperate, but our brain keeps saying, why are we going in this direction? It seems

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:39.950
to me we should be going in that direction instead. Well, if we have been given new direction,

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:50.709
and mentally we're strongly inclined otherwise, then we have a problem, but we also have a solution.

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:59.150
And that's at Philippians chapter 3. Can we go there? Now here Paul discusses a problem

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:05.629
that existed back there in some congregations. Now was it a big problem in Philippi apparently

00:02:05.629 --> 00:02:12.629
not, but anticipating that it might be a problem for some individuals there. Paul addresses

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:19.430
it right here in Philippians chapter 3 verse 15 and 16. It says, therefore let those of

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:26.430
us who are mature, be of this mental attitude. And if you are mentally inclined otherwise

00:02:26.469 --> 00:02:33.469
in any respect, God will reveal the above attitude to you at any rate to the extent with

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:40.469
made progress. Let us go on walking orderly in this same course. What is Paul talking

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:47.710
about? A major organizational adjustment, the shift from the Mosaic law to Christianity.

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:58.229
And Paul for one understood it. He was not mentally inclined otherwise. He left behind

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:06.349
his attachment to the law. Any personal advantages that it was bringing him may be along the lines

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:11.789
of prominence prestige among the Jews, left it all behind. That was Paul. But it took

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:18.789
some Jewish Christians years to grow to the point where they could leave that law behind

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:25.789
and fully adopt all aspects of Christianity. Why did it take them so long? Now it's easy

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:36.110
for us to say, well, they were stubborn. They had a bad attitude. And some of them

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:43.110
did. There were some, for example, who wanted to hold on to parts of the law just to avoid

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:51.710
persecution. So you had things like that going on. But think also of this. Prior to Christianity,

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:58.430
the Mosaic law was Jehovah's arrangement for worship. So there must have been some Jewish

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:04.949
worshipers who before becoming Christian were very loyal to the Mosaic law. And being

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:11.270
of the loyal sort, what do you think they did? Just obey the law? No, they'd have taken

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:18.269
it further. They'd have worked hard to cultivate a strong appreciation for the law, a deep

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:23.509
love for the way different features of the law reflected Jehovah's personality, his ways,

00:04:23.509 --> 00:04:29.509
his thinking. Perhaps some invested years bringing their appreciation up to that high level

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:36.750
and now that they had the law suddenly goes out of effect, you can appreciate why it might

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:43.430
have been hard for some loyal ones to process this change mentally. Could something like

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:49.189
that happen today? Yes, it could. Maybe you're taught years ago. This is how we preach

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:56.189
and this is why. Or this is how the congregation handles certain situations and this is why.

00:04:56.589 --> 00:05:02.509
Or this is how we view certain branch procedures and this is why it is the very best way. Now,

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:09.389
being of the loyal sort, what did you do? You made it all your own, not just the arrangement

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:14.189
itself, but the reasoning behind the arrangement. If somebody came along and challenged it,

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:22.189
you loyally defended it. And maybe it took you years to bring your appreciation up to that high

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:31.230
level, but loyally you did. And now that you did, the arrangement changes. And maybe even the

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:38.350
reasoning behind the arrangements. Well, like some of those early Jewish Christians, your very

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:45.470
loyalty to a previous theocratic arrangement might make it hard to grasp immediately the wisdom

00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:51.709
behind the new adjustment. Well, like we said, that's the problem. What's the solution? What can

00:05:51.709 --> 00:05:59.709
we actually do about it? Three things. And all three are right there in the verses we just read.

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:08.029
First, be patient. What do Paul say there in verse 15? Therefore, let those of us who are

00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:14.269
mature be of this mental attitude and if you're mentally inclined otherwise, God will reveal the above

00:06:14.269 --> 00:06:20.430
attitude to you. So if you've made an earnest endeavor, a prayerful endeavor to get the sense

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:28.670
behind a change. And for now, you just can't set it aside. Be patient because the day will come.

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:39.629
Maybe sooner, but maybe later when the pieces finally fall into place for you and you grasp the

00:06:39.629 --> 00:06:48.829
wisdom behind the adjustment. Now number two, walk orderly. What does that mean? The study note for

00:06:48.829 --> 00:06:55.230
verse 16 explains that walking orderly has to do with moving forward unitedly as Christians.

00:06:55.230 --> 00:07:00.670
So in the context of what we're talking about right now, walking orderly means support the new

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:08.029
arrangement without resisting, without complaining. Because what does complaining and resisting do? It's

00:07:08.029 --> 00:07:16.269
it's walking disorderly. It's promoting disunity. So no, we walk orderly. We support the arrangement.

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:24.189
Now number three, stay busy in your theocratic routine because there in verse 16, Paul encourages

00:07:24.189 --> 00:07:31.870
all of the Philippians to keep making progress. Now the same is true of all of us. Certainly,

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:37.629
there are many aspects of the truth that we do appreciate. We do understand and we're making

00:07:37.629 --> 00:07:44.990
progress. Good. Put your mind and heart there, right? Rather than continuing to obsess over something

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:53.149
that you just can't understand for now, stay busy on your assignment and stay absorbed in your

00:07:53.149 --> 00:08:03.149
weekly spiritual routine. It brings immediate contentment. Let's reveal. If we ever have a problem

00:08:05.149 --> 00:08:10.509
understanding and adjustment to a theocratic arrangement, we also have a solution.

00:08:11.149 --> 00:08:20.589
Philippians 316, be patient, walk orderly, and stay busy in our theocratic routine.

00:08:21.949 --> 00:08:30.750
Now I would like to conclude by illustrating that last point, the value of staying busy in our

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:36.110
theocratic routine. Because it is the solution, not just to what we're talking about right now,

00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:41.629
it is the solution to several situations in life. Now the illustration is one that I heard several

00:08:41.629 --> 00:08:51.309
years ago at a Gillian graduation program. One of your instructors told us about the old steamboats

00:08:51.309 --> 00:08:56.429
that used coal for fuel, right? So upstairs you had the captain in the crew, downstairs you have

00:08:56.429 --> 00:09:03.230
these men busy shoveling coal into the ship's boiler, right? Now imagine one of these workers puts

00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:07.950
his shovel down and he approaches a coworker and says, hey, did I just detect the ship

00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:14.750
starting to make a left turn? That does not seem right to me. Seems that at this point of the trip,

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:20.590
we should be moving straight forward, not changing direction. I wonder if the captain really knows

00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:24.830
what he's doing. You know what? I'm going to go upstairs and have a word with the captain. Now at

00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:31.870
this point the speaker stopped describing the scene. He just leaned forward close to the microphone

00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:42.669
and he simply said, shovel the coal. Oh, that's you and me, right? That's you and me. We are shoveling

00:09:42.669 --> 00:09:48.750
the coal. We're busy doing the work, Jehovah assigned us to do. That's what we're absorbed in.

00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:54.830
We let Jehovah take care of Isaiah 60, 17, the copper, the gold, the silver. We take care of the coal

00:09:54.830 --> 00:10:04.190
by staying absorbed and busy in our theocratic routine. And then as Jehovah navigates his

00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:13.549
organization, he'll also navigate us to the right attitude, to contentment and to that most

00:10:13.549 --> 00:10:25.629
wonderful adjustment of all from this system to life in the new world.
