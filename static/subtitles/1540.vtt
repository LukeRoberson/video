00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:23.980
That's my roommate, Camille, and, well, that's me.

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.980
I haven't felt like myself recently.

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.979
I started regular pioneering a couple of years ago.

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:42.960
At first, I was really zealous, but somewhere down the line, I lost that good feeling.

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:50.539
Soon, I was losing my joy for almost everything.

00:00:50.539 --> 00:01:00.539
I honestly didn't know what was wrong.

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:06.299
It wasn't like I was doing anything bad.

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:15.480
I thought, maybe I'm just tired.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:20.329
But it wasn't getting better.

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:24.670
I tried to assess what was going on with myself.

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.670
I felt love for Jehovah.

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.670
I felt love for the congregation.

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.980
But I felt unmotivated in my service.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:48.219
I felt like something was missing.

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:51.219
My enthusiasm waned.

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:53.219
My meeting attendant suffered too.

00:01:53.219 --> 00:02:03.430
Thankfully, the loving elders in my congregation noticed.

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:12.610
And help was on the way.

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:19.800
The brothers visited to see how I was doing.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.139
They really listened to me.

00:02:24.139 --> 00:02:27.139
And they asked about my spiritual routine.

00:02:27.139 --> 00:02:30.139
Well, I read the Bible every day.

00:02:30.139 --> 00:02:34.139
But I admitted, I'm not a natural study person.

00:02:34.139 --> 00:02:39.139
They reminded me about the example of Mary, Jesus' mother.

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:42.139
At first, I didn't see the link.

00:02:42.139 --> 00:02:46.139
But as we read from the Bible, it became more clear.

00:02:46.139 --> 00:03:00.740
Mary was known for being a faithful woman.

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:11.580
But what kept her faith strong?

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:18.580
The Bible account said that Mary paid careful attention to words that had deep spiritual meaning.

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:24.580
And later took time to meditate during conclusions in her heart.

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:44.620
By meditating on spiritual themes, Mary strengthened her faith and zeal for serving Jehovah.

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.620
I understand now.

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.620
I was reading spiritual food, but I wasn't taking time to digest it.

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.620
So it wasn't sinking down into my heart.

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.620
As a result, I was on a direct path to spiritual burnout.

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:05.620
If I didn't change something quick, I began by taking control of my busy schedule.

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:10.620
I made it a priority to start my day with Bible reading.

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:15.620
I sought out quiet places, or I could meditate on what I read.

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:23.620
Meaningful Bible study reinvigorated my passion for serving Jehovah.

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:32.420
And prayerful meditation helped me to refocus.

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:39.420
Over time, making these changes helped me to find joy in my service to Jehovah again.

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:53.939
The Bible says, when we make time to read and meditate on spiritual things,

00:04:53.939 --> 00:04:58.939
we will become like a tree planted by streams of water,

00:04:58.939 --> 00:05:05.939
with foliage that never withers and everything we do will succeed.
