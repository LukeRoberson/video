00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:06.769
How do many people react when they see corruption and injustice?

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:10.250
They become insensed, and they want to fix the problem.

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:12.490
How do they try to fix the problem?

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:19.250
By becoming involved in political efforts or social movements that claimed a fight, corruption

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.730
and injustice.

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:27.929
In contrast, why did Jehovah's Witnesses not get involved in political efforts or social

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:29.489
movements?

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:34.810
The simple answer, because they've learned from God's word that the problems of this

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:38.250
world cannot be corrected.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:46.130
Ecclesiastes 115 says, What is crooked cannot be made straight.

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:52.490
Sayings world around us is like the truck of a tree that has grown so crooked, twisted,

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:56.490
norlled it cannot be made straight.

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:02.210
Jehovah's Witnesses have learned, it would be futile to spend our time and energy, trying

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.609
to correct what Jehovah tells us cannot be corrected.

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:14.129
Additionally, Jehovah's Witnesses have learned how and where real peace can be found even

00:01:14.129 --> 00:01:15.810
now.

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:22.609
In this regard, let's consider two modern-day examples of ones who came to acquire Jehovah's

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:25.769
thinking on this matter.

00:01:25.769 --> 00:01:34.170
Let's talk about As Hideo Nahokbria and Fratha Brun, now first As Hideo.

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:41.290
Born in a remote part of East Timor, he experienced horrible guerrilla warfare during his childhood.

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:47.290
Many of his neighbors disappeared or were killed, and he feared he would be next.

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:53.209
But some years later he moved to the capital city and entered a university where he met

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.769
many other use with background-similared yes.

00:01:57.769 --> 00:02:03.689
He became part of a student group that was trying to achieve social change through political

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.370
action.

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:13.210
Many political demonstrations were organized, but most ended up in riots with many of his

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.009
friends injured.

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:17.050
Some were even killed.

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:22.009
But then through a relative who was studying with Jehovah's Witnesses as Hideo started

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:23.009
to study.

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:27.090
Now, here's what he said as he started to study.

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:34.569
As I studied the Bible, I began to feel that I had never really known love.

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:40.330
Despite my rough appearance and disposition, the Witnesses treated me with fellow feeling

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:41.849
and brotherly affection.

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:48.009
Well, soon he was baptized, became a regular pioneer, and he was so happy because now

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.250
he knew he was truly helping people.

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.210
He ended his life story with these words.

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:01.449
In the past I felt angry, unloved, and unlovable.

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:08.289
But thanks to Jehovah at last I have found true love and peace.

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:11.490
But now let's talk about Fratha.

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:16.650
From an early age he was very upset by all the hatred, bloodshed, and war he saw around

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:22.650
him, but especially he was disturbed by religion's role in all of this.

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:28.729
He observed that much of this hatred, bloodshed, and war was encouraged, supported, or at

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:32.129
least condoned by religion.

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:39.849
But in 1955 he attended a convention of Jehovah's Witnesses, and after the convention he accepted

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:41.569
a Bible study.

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:46.409
Now during his studies he learned many wonderful things, but something he learned really motivated

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:47.409
him.

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:54.729
He learned the identity of the great prostitute, Bab and the Great, mentioned in Revelation

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:56.969
chapter 17 and 18.

00:03:56.969 --> 00:04:03.129
He learned that this prostitute is the world-empower-a-false religion.

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:11.370
Then he was really amazed when he was shown Revelation 1824, which says in her the prostitute

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:17.449
was found the blood of all those who have been slaughtered on the earth.

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:24.730
So he learned that the world's religions could never be a force for international peace,

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:30.370
because they take sides, they're divided, and they go to war.

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:37.009
In contrast he saw that Jehovah's Witnesses are an international brotherhood that truly

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:40.089
practices what Jesus taught.

00:04:40.089 --> 00:04:42.889
Both of those progress was very fast.

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:48.689
He got baptized, started pioneering, he attended the 50th class of Gilead, and has served many

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:58.129
years in Guatemala helping people as he was helped to find the true source of peace.

00:04:58.129 --> 00:05:03.930
But now we ask, what are lessons we can learn from his Hideo and Freytha, who are many,

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:06.329
but here are three big ones.

00:05:06.329 --> 00:05:15.089
Number one, we can never correct the corruption and injustice of this world by means of political

00:05:15.089 --> 00:05:18.569
efforts or social movements.

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:23.370
That reminds me of the illustration of other years about trying to get rid of a problem

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:27.170
with spider webs, but being unable to get rid of the spider.

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:29.610
You're not the webs down.

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:32.250
Spider builds them right back, knock them down, builds them back.

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:33.769
You never get rid of the problem.

00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:41.610
Well, in this illustration, Satan is the spider, and since he's the source of corruption

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:47.410
and injustice, as long as he exists, the problem will exist.

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:50.009
And little puny humans can't get rid of Satan.

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:51.769
He's superhuman.

00:05:51.769 --> 00:05:59.209
So the solution must also be superhuman, and that's where God's kingdom comes in.

00:05:59.209 --> 00:06:06.129
It's kingdom can and will not only get rid of the webs, but the old spider Satan himself

00:06:06.129 --> 00:06:07.129
too.

00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:09.850
Now here's our second lesson.

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:17.170
We must remember that political activism often leads to violence, which is the opposite

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:18.730
of peace.

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:21.009
We pursue peace, don't we?

00:06:21.009 --> 00:06:24.889
Not conduct that often leads to violence.

00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:32.810
Our third lesson, unlike the religions of this world, we must promote peace with all

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:40.490
people, which definitely means we refuse to get involved in any way in the wars of Satan's

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:41.490
world.

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:45.209
That reminds me of an experience a young brother had in the ministry.

00:06:45.209 --> 00:06:51.730
A very emotional woman said to him, My son died.

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:57.810
For you to have the freedom you have, why won't you fight for your country?

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:05.490
Well, very calmly, the young brother said, I'm very sorry about the loss of your dear son.

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:12.410
But one thing I can guarantee you is that it was not one of Jehovah's Witnesses who killed

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:13.410
your son.

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:18.689
Now, I don't know if you can make that guarantee about your religion, but I can make that guarantee.

00:07:19.649 --> 00:07:26.370
Well as it turned out, she was Catholic, so she definitely was unable to make that guarantee.

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:32.050
So let's remember these three powerful lessons that we have discussed.

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:36.889
But now we'd like to say to you dear interested ones in attendance, if you're not yet one

00:07:36.889 --> 00:07:44.810
of Jehovah's Witnesses, we warmly invite you to please study the Bible with us.

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:51.449
See for yourself how genuine love is the best way of life and is the best way to deal

00:07:51.449 --> 00:07:55.610
with the problems that divide society today.

00:07:55.610 --> 00:08:03.050
Jesus made it crystal clear that the identified mark of true Christians is love.

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:12.490
At John 1335 he said, By this all will know that you are My disciples if you have love

00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:14.649
among yourselves.

00:08:14.649 --> 00:08:21.649
So dear interested ones, see for yourself whether this genuine love exists among Jehovah's

00:08:21.649 --> 00:08:23.610
Witnesses.

00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:29.889
But now we say to those of you who are already Jehovah's Witnesses, please continue to cultivate

00:08:29.889 --> 00:08:35.610
and show love for the whole association of brothers.

00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:41.529
And doing so will require that you remain strictly neutral regarding the world's political

00:08:41.529 --> 00:08:45.049
affairs and other controversies.

00:08:45.049 --> 00:08:53.129
Just as our leader remained neutral, at John 1714, Jesus said of His disciples, They are

00:08:53.129 --> 00:08:59.610
no part of the world, just as I am no part of the world.

00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:06.769
So during discussions in the ministry or anywhere for that matter, remain strictly neutral

00:09:06.769 --> 00:09:09.690
on political topics.

00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:16.850
Make no position regarding what law should be enacted, repealed, or changed, and don't

00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:20.769
pressure others to agree with your view.

00:09:20.769 --> 00:09:26.730
But to succeed in this, we must be careful not to allow the media of this world to manipulate

00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:28.889
our thinking.

00:09:28.889 --> 00:09:34.409
News broadcasts are often presented in a biased, opinionated way.

00:09:34.409 --> 00:09:37.730
So we've got to be careful not to adopt the bias of a commentator.

00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:43.970
Only if we keep our thinking neutral, we'll be able to keep our speech and actions neutral

00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:45.730
also.

00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:51.809
And remember, your good example of showing love and Christian neutrality may attract

00:09:51.809 --> 00:09:55.970
honest-hearted ones to the truth.

00:09:55.970 --> 00:10:01.009
But now we ask, What have we learned from this symposium?

00:10:01.649 --> 00:10:07.850
We'll let's highlight just one valuable takeaway lesson from each of our six parts.

00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:18.370
The first part, Joseph and his brothers, our lesson, So Peace by Letting Go of Resentment.

00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:26.169
The second part, The Gibbianites, humbly submit to Jehovah's will, even if it differs

00:10:26.169 --> 00:10:28.490
from what you prefer.

00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:36.649
The third part, Gideon, prevent conflicts from escalating by choosing words that calm,

00:10:36.649 --> 00:10:39.929
reassure, and heal.

00:10:39.929 --> 00:10:47.250
The fourth part, Abigail, do what you can to promote peace, and then leave matters with

00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:48.730
Jehovah.

00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:55.330
The fifth part, Mephiba Sheth, be willing to suffer loss rather than disturb the peace and

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:57.169
the congregation.

00:10:57.169 --> 00:11:01.450
And just another thought on this, let's always remember that defending Jehovah's name and

00:11:01.450 --> 00:11:08.570
reputation is far more important than trying to defend her own name and reputation.

00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:14.529
Be willing to suffer loss rather than disturb the peace in the congregation.

00:11:14.529 --> 00:11:22.129
The sixth part, this part, modern day examples, serve the God of peace with His people, and

00:11:22.129 --> 00:11:24.169
you will have peace.

00:11:24.889 --> 00:11:29.889
Yes, during this symposium, we've learned many valuable lessons as to how we can so

00:11:29.889 --> 00:11:30.889
peace.

00:11:30.889 --> 00:11:34.850
Let's all be determined to do so with all our heart.

00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:37.370
And what will be the final result?

00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:49.379
For the answer, let's watch the final dramatization of this symposium.

00:11:49.379 --> 00:11:52.720
There's one more story to tell.

00:11:52.720 --> 00:12:06.230
I didn't know it at the time, but seeds of truth were being planted in my heart.

00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:08.830
You were also different.

00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:15.659
I couldn't understand it.

00:12:15.659 --> 00:12:31.159
You were prisoners, yes, but you felt free, truly free.

00:12:31.159 --> 00:12:41.139
After you were released, it became clear to me that you have God's blessing, and I wanted

00:12:41.139 --> 00:12:42.139
to know why.

00:12:42.139 --> 00:12:50.100
Phil, help me find the answer.

00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:58.110
And you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.

00:12:58.110 --> 00:13:01.230
Phil encouraged me to make the truth my own.

00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:06.110
I had real trouble at first.

00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:13.149
With all the turmoil going on at the time, the idea of being peaceable and waiting on

00:13:13.149 --> 00:13:25.960
God's kingdom, it was hard to grasp.

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:35.220
But with Jehovah's help and the patience of these good people, I was baptized before

00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:47.159
the start of the Great Tribulation.

00:13:47.159 --> 00:13:54.240
Joseph, during our time in prison, a story of your life, your time in prison, and how

00:13:54.240 --> 00:14:00.159
Jehovah was always with you became a real source of strength for us.

00:14:00.159 --> 00:14:07.279
I remember one day, Carl said, what did you say?

00:14:07.279 --> 00:14:14.559
I said, one day, we'll have a meal with Joseph, and we'll say, thank you.

00:14:14.559 --> 00:14:20.720
And here we are, really, it's I who should thank you.

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:26.039
Each and every one of your stories touches my heart.

00:14:26.039 --> 00:14:31.600
You know a lot about my life, but would it be all right if I shared a few more stories?

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:33.679
Please, we have so many questions.

00:14:33.679 --> 00:14:35.440
Can you tell us about Egypt?

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:36.840
What was Pharaoh really like?

00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:37.840
Dreams.

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:41.639
We got to talk about those dreams.

00:14:41.639 --> 00:14:48.039
You do have many questions, and I have many details to share.

00:14:48.039 --> 00:15:02.519
And thanks to our God, Jehovah, we have all the time we need.

00:15:02.519 --> 00:15:05.120
What a touching video.

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:12.759
If we hold heartedly so peace, we'll save ourselves and those who listen to us.

00:15:12.759 --> 00:15:19.279
But what fundamental truth from our great God have we discussed during this symposium?

00:15:19.279 --> 00:15:27.960
This expressed at Galatians 6, verse 7, for whatever a person is sewing, this he will

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:30.399
also reap.

00:15:30.399 --> 00:15:35.080
If we sow tomato seed, we will always get tomato plants.

00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:39.519
Well, this unfailing fundamental truth applies to peace.

00:15:39.519 --> 00:15:44.159
If we sow peace, we will always reap peace.

00:15:44.159 --> 00:15:50.720
Although in some cases it may take some time for the peace we sowed to bring good results.

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:58.320
But if we persevere in sewing peace, we will reap peace of mind, peace with others, and

00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:04.519
most importantly peace with Jehovah, and we'll reap the reward of living forever in a world

00:16:04.519 --> 00:16:08.919
where there will be an abundance of peace.

00:16:08.919 --> 00:16:15.600
So let's be determined to sow peace now so we can reap peace forever, and if you think

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:21.120
about it, that's a pretty good investment of our time and effort, isn't it?

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:26.559
sow peace now, and reap peace forever.
