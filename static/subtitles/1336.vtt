00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:14.759
The story of Armenia is a story of faith, the faith of courageous brothers and sisters who endured mob violence,

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:25.320
protests, and threats from those who do not know God, the faith of young brothers who were imprisoned

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:35.140
because they refused to compromise their neutrality, and the faith of lawyers who defended them when they were arrested.

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:43.420
In the early part of this period, the work operated out of the office in a local brother's home.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.420
Today, the story is much different.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:58.420
On May 14, 2016, our brothers in Armenia were delighted to dedicate a group of new facilities to accommodate future growth.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:16.170
A branch facility, mainly located on six floors of a local building, a new assembly hall, and also a school facility.

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:26.170
The dedication week started off with a welcome night where many traveled long distances to attend, and some had not seen each other for a long time.

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:33.170
Well, we've never been to Armenia before, and meeting the brothers and sisters was such an experience.

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.170
They gave us a really warm welcome.

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:50.170
When I was 90, I decided no more Armenia, and now I'm 96 and you've said you're going to Armenia. What a blessing!

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:58.170
It was amazing to see so many brothers and sisters from different countries, and we're enjoying them very, very nice time with them.

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.700
Thanks to Jehovah, we really enjoyed this.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:11.699
But the spiritual gems that we all enjoyed the most were during the dedication program held at the end of the week.

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:21.699
The program was filled with reports and interviews that touched our hearts, and brothers' plane of the governing body gave the dedication talk.

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:32.699
Is it your desire to dedicate the branch facilities, the assembly hall, and the school facility to Jehovah today?

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:41.659
We could never have imagined such a thing happening five years ago.

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:49.659
In the time that we arrived at the airport, we saw the brothers wholly holding up the JW dot org sign with their badges.

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:52.659
We were just so overwhelmed, so moved.

00:02:52.659 --> 00:03:02.659
And I could feel as if I'm in the paradise today, because we have so many guests from different countries, and I could see their happy faces.

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:21.659
For many years to be in courts, in legal battles, for our brothers as conscientious objectors, or to go to the court for fighting a case, for just one kingdom hall, and suddenly to have branch and assembly hall and school facilities right away,

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:24.659
that's for me it's kind of unbelievable.

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:29.659
Today is great day for Jehovah's people in Armenia.

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:42.319
Truly, Jehovah has seen the faithful obedience of our brothers and sisters in Armenia.

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:50.319
We have witnessed Jehovah open the floodgates of the heavens and actually empty out a blessing until there is no more want.
