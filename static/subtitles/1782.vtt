00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:09.220
When a person makes a sacrifice, they give up something for something that they consider is of higher value.

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:16.219
What kind of a price tag can you put on your child's love for Jehovah?

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:22.219
What kind of a price tag can you put on serving Jehovah whole soul as a family?

00:00:22.219 --> 00:00:29.219
When I found out that we were going to have a family, it was overwhelming for me.

00:00:29.219 --> 00:00:34.219
When you come into the truth, we weren't witnesses when I was a child.

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:39.219
Sometimes you're exposed to things that leave you with baggage.

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:42.219
Leave you unsure of yourself.

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:47.219
You need constant reassurance that you're going to be okay.

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.219
You can take care of any situation that comes along.

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:54.219
My dad, he gave me all I needed.

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:56.219
He loved me so much.

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:02.219
I would take my mother's knitting yarn and tie it to his door handle after he went to sleep.

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:09.219
I would run it across the hall to my bedroom and tie it to my big toe so that when he opened his door in the morning, I would wake up.

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:11.219
I could be with him.

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:17.219
That love that I had for my dad, I wanted them to love Jehovah that much.

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:24.219
I wanted a string tied around their hearts right to Jehovah so that he was the one motivating them.

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:28.219
And he was the one waking them up spiritually every day.

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:35.219
I loved to teach the children things and I would do it at any available moment.

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:40.219
And then of course at night as a family, usually on our bed we would read our Bible together.

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:48.219
It was the glue that kept us tied to Jehovah and kept us tied to each other.

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:53.219
Judges 7, Gideon said, watch me and do what I do.

00:01:53.219 --> 00:02:02.219
So I knew that if we wanted the children to live the truth, that we had to live it with them.

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.219
It couldn't be something that we just taught them.

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:11.219
We had to live our life of service to Jehovah with them.

00:02:11.219 --> 00:02:16.219
Jesus said obviously we can't slave for two masters.

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:20.219
And I've tried to do that and believe me it does not work.

00:02:21.219 --> 00:02:26.219
Like any father, I wanted to have a home for my family.

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:32.219
My profession was building houses, but that cost me my pioneering.

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:37.219
And so I decided I had to equip building houses.

00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:38.219
And so I did.

00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:46.219
I started to do remodeled jobs and we looked for a place that we could afford that would sustain us in the full-time service.

00:02:46.219 --> 00:02:51.219
And Jehovah provided exactly what we needed.

00:02:51.219 --> 00:02:58.219
One of the highlights of raising the children was the annual visits to unassigned territory.

00:02:58.219 --> 00:03:01.219
The success in the ministry was phenomenal.

00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:07.219
So we decided as a family to take on the challenge of learning Spanish.

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:13.219
We had a large Spanish speaking population in our territory and in the surrounding territories.

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:18.219
And there was no group or congregation to help them.

00:03:18.219 --> 00:03:25.219
When we would go out of the country to preach, we would often stay with family members of our Bible students,

00:03:25.219 --> 00:03:31.219
our brothers and sisters in these countries, and some very humble surroundings.

00:03:32.219 --> 00:03:41.219
And we took advantage of the hospitality that they offered us because we wanted to live the culture with them.

00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:47.219
It just opened our eyes to a world that we never knew existed.

00:03:47.219 --> 00:03:59.219
Our family was able to progress and flourish spiritually because of a concentrated effort with John and I.

00:03:59.219 --> 00:04:02.219
We've been there to fill in all of the cracks.

00:04:02.219 --> 00:04:11.219
He always made it so easy to love him, to love the children, and to really focus on spiritual things.

00:04:11.219 --> 00:04:20.220
When we prayed to Jehovah thinking about our family being able to serve him like this, we just say thank you.

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:32.220
We just try in some way to express how deeply we feel about this privilege that we have to be with Carson and Cherstee and Andrea Dimo.

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:48.220
We don't deserve any of these blessings from Jehovah, but somehow he's blessed our efforts and he's given us an opportunity to smile and reflect on all of the things that he's done for us.

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:58.220
And what can we do to repage Jehovah but just keep going, keep trying, and keep moving forward until we're on the other side.
