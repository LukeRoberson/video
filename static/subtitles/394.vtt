00:00:01.419 --> 00:00:06.980
By the time the Apostle Peter wrote the words of today's text, individuals who were Jews,

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:13.619
proselytes, Samaritans, and Gentiles had been brought into the Christian congregation as God's

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:17.260
people, the spiritual Israel of God.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:22.300
In the verse before today's text, Peter outlined what their mission was.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.579
Let's open to 1 Peter chapter 2 and read of that.

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:31.989
It's in verses 9 and 10 of 1 Peter 2.

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:39.590
He wrote, but you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:45.469
special possession, that you should declare abroad the excellencies of the one who called

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:51.109
you out of darkness into his wonderful light, for you were once not a people, but now you

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:53.310
are God's people.

00:00:53.310 --> 00:01:00.909
And of course, this refers to the spirit anointed members of the congregation who would be responsible

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:04.709
for glorifying Jehovah's name as his witnesses.

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:10.189
And this harmonizes with what Peter had said years earlier in the first century governing

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:14.430
body meeting as reported in Acts chapter 15.

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:21.790
So let's turn there, Acts 15, and we will begin with verse 14.

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:26.269
It says, Simeon has related thoroughly how God, for the first time, turned his attention

00:01:26.269 --> 00:01:31.069
to the nations to take out of them a people for his name.

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:35.709
And with this, the words of the prophets agree, just as it is written, after these things,

00:01:35.709 --> 00:01:39.909
I will return and raise up again the tent of David that has fallen down.

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:45.269
I will rebuild his ruins and restore it so that the men who remain may earnestly seat

00:01:45.269 --> 00:01:51.269
Jehovah together with people of all the nations, people who are called by my name, says

00:01:51.269 --> 00:01:55.629
Jehovah, who is doing these things.

00:01:55.629 --> 00:02:01.950
Now what about the rest of us who are not anointed Christians, but who call ourselves Jehovah's

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:02.950
witnesses?

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.310
Are we also God's people, well, most certainly?

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.550
And what a proud honor it is for us to bear the name of the only true God.

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:18.030
But with that name, goes responsibility, one that other religious groups do not want

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.030
to take on.

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:25.069
You see, we are under obligation to bear witness to Jehovah, to tell the truth about

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:31.189
him, and to expose false teachings that misrepresent Jehovah.

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:36.789
And a classic example of an unscriptural dogma that God's people have exposed is the

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:42.550
Trinity, which reminds me of another hoax that fooled many people who should have known

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:43.550
better.

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:52.830
It's the true story about a man named Van Migren, a Dutch artist born in 1889, who perpetrated

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:58.069
what may have been the most sensational art hoax of all time.

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:02.229
You see, he never won the critical acclaim that he thought he was due as an artist.

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:07.870
So to get back at the art critics, he decided to demonstrate his talent by producing a

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:13.949
painting that would fool them all, and he set out to imitate the famous 17th century

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:18.069
Dutch Impressionist Johannes Vermeer.

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:23.870
Well Van Migren spent four years figuring out how to make a new painting look 300 years

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.389
old.

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:26.830
The canvas was easy part.

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:31.389
He just took a lesser known painting from the 17th century and removed the picture.

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:35.710
His biggest problem was getting oil paint to harden thoroughly, which usually takes

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:37.430
50 years.

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:43.669
He solved it by mixing his pigments with a synthetic resin instead of oil and then baking

00:03:43.669 --> 00:03:45.469
the canvas.

00:03:45.469 --> 00:03:51.189
Well Van Migren produced six paintings that were passed off as Vermeer's.

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:57.909
His greatest soul in 1937, it was entitled Christ and the Disciples at Emmaus.

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:03.669
The most authoritative art historian of the day said it was a genuine Vermeer masterpiece

00:04:03.669 --> 00:04:09.310
untouched on the original canvas and that it had no restoration done to it.

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.189
But in reality, it was a fake.

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:17.629
The critic's opinion was taken as gospel in the art world so much that this critic had

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:21.310
been nicknamed the Pope.

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.470
Eventually though a chemical analysis proved the paint contained an ingredient that had

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:30.649
not been discovered until two centuries after Vermeer died and that's what exposed Van

00:04:30.649 --> 00:04:33.509
Migren as a fraud.

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:37.949
There's something similar when I'm during the apostasy that took place after the death

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:39.790
of the Apostles.

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:46.670
Less than 300 years after the Bible was completed, a Trinitarian added to 1 John 5, 7 the words

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:54.029
in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost, and these three are one.

00:04:54.029 --> 00:04:59.949
However, this addition does not appear in the oldest Greek manuscripts proving it's

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:03.069
a fake, it's a corruption of God's Word.

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:07.870
And yet for centuries, the Church's propagated the Trinity doctrine.

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:14.470
As recently as the 19th century, almost all Bible translations had this spurious addition.

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:22.310
As late as 1897, Pope Leo XIII upheld the corrupted text of the Latin Vulgate.

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:26.910
Interestingly, the new Catholic encyclopedia comments on this and says, a Trinitarian dogma

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:34.110
is in the last analysis a late fourth century invention among the Apostolic fathers there

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:39.029
had been nothing even remotely approaching such a mentality or perspective.

00:05:39.029 --> 00:05:46.750
Well, Jehovah's anointed witnesses firmly rejected Christenham's Trinity dogma.

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:52.949
In 1915, the Watchtower exposed the foolishness of teaching a doctrine that contradicts the

00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:54.389
Bible.

00:05:54.389 --> 00:06:00.189
The Watchtower said, in what a jumble of contradictions and confusion do they find themselves who

00:06:00.189 --> 00:06:04.269
say that Jesus and the Father are one God?

00:06:04.269 --> 00:06:08.589
This would involve the idea that our Lord Jesus acted the hypocrite one on earth and only

00:06:08.589 --> 00:06:13.589
pretended to address God in prayer when He Himself was the same God.

00:06:13.589 --> 00:06:19.069
The Father has always been immortal, hence could not die, how then could Jesus have died?

00:06:19.069 --> 00:06:22.269
The Scriptures declare, however, that He did die.

00:06:22.269 --> 00:06:26.269
If they admit that Jesus really died, they take the other horn of the dilemma.

00:06:26.269 --> 00:06:31.350
For believing that there are three gods are all one person as many do, when Jesus died,

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:33.310
they must all three have died.

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:36.230
If they all died, who raised them to life?

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:38.750
How foolish all this sounds.

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:43.189
Shall we thus contradict the apostles and prophets in Jesus Himself and ignore reason and

00:06:43.189 --> 00:06:48.910
common sense in order to hold to a dogma handed to us from the dark superstitious past

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:51.589
by a corrupt apostate church?

00:06:51.589 --> 00:06:55.339
Nay says the Watchtower.

00:06:55.339 --> 00:07:02.300
Well, Jehovah's people continue to uphold the excellencies of the only true God.

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:07.220
Whether in ancient times as with the natural Israelites or in modern times with spiritual

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:11.620
Israel, Jehovah's words through Isaiah are still true.

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:16.500
Look at it in Isaiah chapter 43 and verse 21.

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:22.459
And of course we know in Isaiah chapter 43, Jehovah declares, you are my witnesses.

00:07:22.459 --> 00:07:30.379
And in verse 27 or verse 21, He says, the people whom I formed for myself, so that they

00:07:30.379 --> 00:07:34.180
might declare my praise.

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:41.860
And the effort that Jehovah's witnesses, God's people, have put forth to expose Bible teachings

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:47.220
that are false, to teach the truth about Jehovah, and to sanctify God's name, has taken

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:51.300
on proportions never attained by any other religious group.

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:54.060
And Jehovah takes notice of that.

00:07:54.060 --> 00:08:04.670
Look at Malachi, the third chapter, Malachi chapter 3, beginning with verse 16, Malachi

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:06.709
316.

00:08:06.709 --> 00:08:12.149
At that time, those who feared Jehovah spoke with one another, each one with his companion,

00:08:12.149 --> 00:08:15.189
and Jehovah kept paying attention and listening.

00:08:15.189 --> 00:08:20.430
And a book of remembrance was written before him for those fearing Jehovah and for those

00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:25.990
meditating, or the footnote says, possibly treasuring his name.

00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:33.070
And they will be mine, says Jehovah of armies in the day when I produce a special property.

00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:40.590
So Jehovah truly does love those who fear him and treasure his name, making them truly

00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:41.590
God's people.
