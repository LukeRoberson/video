WEBVTT

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:14.259
It was now Tishray, the start of a month-long festival.

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:19.260
We had just rebuilt the wall of Jehovah's Great City.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:25.260
Now, it was time to rebuild the spirituality of his chosen people.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.260
Many did not know God's law.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:36.740
Who better to help us gain understanding than a man who had come before me? Ezra.

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:43.079
The regulations and judicial decisions of Jehovah.

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.079
He and other Levites read aloud from the law of Moses.

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:55.859
They not only read it, they explained it, putting meaning into it.

00:00:55.859 --> 00:01:00.859
As a people, we began to understand how badly we had disappointed Jehovah

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:07.239
by working on the Sabbath, offering lame sacrifices,

00:01:07.239 --> 00:01:11.239
and divorcing our wives to marry foreign women.

00:01:11.239 --> 00:01:14.239
It hurt our hearts.

00:01:14.239 --> 00:01:19.239
But by reading God's law, we were learning to beat Jehovah's people again.

00:01:19.239 --> 00:01:22.239
It's not mourn or weep.

00:01:22.239 --> 00:01:27.239
Now that you know what displeases God, you can do what pleases Him.

00:01:27.239 --> 00:01:29.239
So go.

00:01:29.239 --> 00:01:31.239
Eat the choice things.

00:01:31.239 --> 00:01:33.239
And drink what is sweet.

00:01:33.239 --> 00:01:36.239
And send portion to those who have nothing.

00:01:36.239 --> 00:01:38.239
And do not feel sad.

00:01:38.239 --> 00:01:42.239
For the joy of Jehovah is your stronghold.

00:01:42.239 --> 00:01:53.379
We followed Jehovah's instructions to observe the festival of booths.

00:01:53.379 --> 00:02:15.180
We spent days rejoicing and giving thanks for Jehovah's blessing.

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:22.780
Then on the 24th day, we assembled to read God's law, to confess our sins,

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.919
and to weep over our wrongdoing.

00:02:26.919 --> 00:02:39.009
We made a binding agreement in writing.

00:02:39.009 --> 00:03:05.879
We resolved to obey Jehovah's law.

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:07.879
Some soon forgot their promise.

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:08.879
Pilate.

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:18.870
Put them in a bag.

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:24.360
Fast, it's hard to carry.

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.360
You hear about Nehemiah's latest idea?

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.360
I mean a plan to repopulate Jerusalem?

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.360
I mean this ridiculous proposal, the force families to move into the city,

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.250
one out of ten by lot.

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:38.250
Yes, I heard.

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.250
And I had to be one who was chosen.

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.250
Why me?

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.250
Does he care what this does to landholders like me?

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:51.530
Oh, so when are you supposed to move?

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:52.530
Move?

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:53.530
I'm not moving anywhere.

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.530
I have a right to live where I choose, and so do you.

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:58.530
I wasn't selected.

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:59.530
Not yet, you mean.

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.530
And when you are, I need you to join me in refusing to move.

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:12.419
Rayham, the king sent Nehemiah here to rebuild the city.

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:16.500
Nehemiah is the governor.

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.500
Governors come, governors go.

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.500
The king is waiting for Nehemiah to return, and when he does,

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.500
things will get back to normal.

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.500
Even when Nehemiah goes back, Jehovah will still be here.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.500
It is his will that Jerusalem be rebuilt.

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.850
Don't you believe that?

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:36.850
So you will go alone, Nehemiah.

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:38.850
How can you be so ungrateful?

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:46.990
Rayham, your ring.

00:04:46.990 --> 00:05:01.180
What was that all about?

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.180
Rayham refuses to move into Jerusalem.

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:10.569
And he wants us to support him.

00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:11.569
What did you say?

00:05:11.569 --> 00:05:16.420
I told him Nehemiah is doing job as well.

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:20.899
Rayham doesn't understand how happy he could be.

00:05:20.899 --> 00:05:23.899
He would just follow Jehovah's direction.

00:05:23.899 --> 00:05:29.870
So we will move if we are selected.

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:32.250
Yes.

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:37.329
I'd rather be like Nehemiah.

00:05:37.329 --> 00:05:39.329
Like Rayham.

00:05:39.329 --> 00:05:41.329
Do you agree?

00:05:41.329 --> 00:05:51.829
Yes.

00:05:51.829 --> 00:05:54.829
At the inauguration of the walls,

00:05:54.829 --> 00:05:58.829
we filled Jerusalem with songs of praise and thanksgiving to God.

00:05:58.829 --> 00:06:07.370
Our great joy could be heard from far away.

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:14.300
When I finally returned to the king,

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.300
I thought about that day often.

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:18.300
With what I know now,

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:20.300
I wish I had never left.

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:35.839
Jehovah raised up a messenger

00:06:35.839 --> 00:06:39.839
who chronicled the themes that happened in Jerusalem during my absence.

00:06:39.839 --> 00:06:43.180
His name was Malachi.

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:51.540
Tobiah, despite not being a Jew,

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:53.540
still found his way into the temple.

00:06:53.540 --> 00:07:00.970
He utilized his Jewish family ties to take advantage of the other Jews.

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:03.970
What brings you to the temple?

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:04.970
It's ten some time.

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:05.970
I just wanted to see you.

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:09.970
Oh, and to bring you this small gift.

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:14.310
Tobiah, you are always so generous.

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:16.310
It's nothing really.

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:19.310
Um, is there nothing I can do for you?

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:21.310
Well, since you asked,

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:23.310
there's one little thing you can do.

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:25.310
Tell me, what can I do for you?

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:28.310
Well, speaking of family,

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:30.310
when our relatives,

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:31.310
here's a mine, I mean,

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:33.310
visit from Samaria.

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:36.310
It would be so nice to have a place to eat with them.

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:39.310
You know, right here in the temple, that is.

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:42.310
After all, they worshiped Jehovah too.

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:44.310
Well, often.

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:47.310
Okay, well, sometimes.

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:49.310
A room in the temple?

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:51.310
But you know, I can't do that.

00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:55.879
That is all the rooms are in use.

00:07:55.879 --> 00:07:57.879
All of them.

00:07:57.879 --> 00:07:59.879
Aren't some of them just store rooms?

00:07:59.879 --> 00:08:04.290
But those are provisions for the Levites.

00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:06.290
But can't you clear one out for me?

00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:08.290
Just one.

00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:10.290
I only need one.

00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:13.290
But what will Nehemiah say?

00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:15.290
What difference does it make?

00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:18.290
Nehemiah is far away in Shushan.

00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:20.290
But what if he finds out?

00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:22.290
Who is going to tell him?

00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:23.290
Are you going to tell him?

00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:24.290
No, no.

00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:26.290
Then, my worry.

00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:45.360
So once again, our high priest has given into Tobiah.

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:46.360
Where should I put this grade?

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:47.360
There's room here.

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:48.360
Be careful.

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:52.210
I've got it.

00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:53.210
Look who's coming.

00:08:53.210 --> 00:09:00.039
Can you hurry, please?

00:09:00.039 --> 00:09:01.039
Once they get out of our way.

00:09:01.039 --> 00:09:04.039
Let's, uh, let's set the table here.

00:09:04.039 --> 00:09:07.039
And then the chairs kind of along the wall.

00:09:07.039 --> 00:09:09.039
Tobiah, tell me, please.

00:09:09.039 --> 00:09:11.039
Where should we store provisions now?

00:09:11.039 --> 00:09:12.039
Wherever you want.

00:09:12.039 --> 00:09:14.039
That's your problem.

00:09:14.039 --> 00:09:16.039
And move along.

00:09:16.039 --> 00:09:19.039
Like now, please.

00:09:19.039 --> 00:09:25.899
All right, so.

00:09:25.899 --> 00:09:28.899
How could Eliaship let anyone?

00:09:28.899 --> 00:09:32.899
Let a lone man like Tobiah take over a room for his own use?

00:09:32.899 --> 00:09:37.899
After all that Nehemiah did to preserve the sacredness of the temple.

00:09:37.899 --> 00:09:40.899
Most people don't give ties anymore anyway.

00:09:40.899 --> 00:09:43.899
If we want to eat, we need to go tend our own flocks in the fields.

00:09:43.899 --> 00:09:46.899
It's of no value to serve God.

00:09:46.899 --> 00:09:49.899
Wait, brothers.

00:09:49.899 --> 00:09:52.899
We can't let their wrong acts take away our joy.

00:09:52.899 --> 00:09:53.899
Why not?

00:09:53.899 --> 00:09:55.899
How have we benefited from serving Jehovah?

00:09:55.899 --> 00:09:56.899
Yes.

00:09:56.899 --> 00:09:59.899
And does in the scriptures say take good care of your sheep?

00:09:59.899 --> 00:10:06.950
It also says a faithful man will receive many blessings.

00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:08.950
We must wait on Jehovah.

00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:12.950
In time, he will straighten everything out.

00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:18.679
Malakai saw how far the people had fallen.

00:10:18.679 --> 00:10:22.679
The Levites, once the proud keepers of Jehovah's standards,

00:10:22.679 --> 00:10:26.679
now found themselves questioning the value of their own service.

00:10:54.299 --> 00:10:58.840
Young man, I'll offer a sheep.

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:03.840
The bigger the offering, the bigger the blessings.

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:10.470
And besides, you know what's more impressive to the neighbors, huh?

00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:12.470
Thank you. I already have an offer.

00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:14.470
Yes, yes, but look.

00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:16.470
You seem like a nice man.

00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:19.470
So today for you a special price, huh?

00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:21.470
Hardly more than you paid for these duffs.

00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:23.470
Come take a look.

00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:27.419
That sheep is blind.

00:11:27.419 --> 00:11:29.419
And look at how it works.

00:11:29.419 --> 00:11:33.419
Young man, that's absolutely normal for this breed.

00:11:33.419 --> 00:11:37.419
God's loss is not to offer blind, lame or sick animals.

00:11:37.419 --> 00:11:41.419
If ever I can afford to offer a sheep, it'll be a sound one.

00:11:41.419 --> 00:11:44.419
Don't waste your money. She's a fine sheep at a fine price.

00:11:44.419 --> 00:11:45.419
I have to go.

00:11:45.419 --> 00:11:47.419
Be practical.

00:11:47.419 --> 00:11:52.940
Besides, it's only a tradition.

00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:55.940
Temple services are not the same.

00:11:55.940 --> 00:12:03.620
It's as if they don't even think about Jehovah.

00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:06.620
Jehovah, what's wrong?

00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:11.279
Jehovah, what happened?

00:12:12.779 --> 00:12:28.299
How's Reham? Certificate of divorce.

00:12:28.299 --> 00:12:36.009
I tried to be a good wife, but it wasn't enough.

00:12:36.009 --> 00:12:38.009
Reham sent me away.

00:12:38.009 --> 00:12:40.009
Don't fear Jehovah.

00:12:40.009 --> 00:12:43.009
You can live here with us.

00:12:43.009 --> 00:12:45.009
We can all share.

00:12:45.009 --> 00:12:48.009
Oh God, it's all my fault.

00:12:48.009 --> 00:12:51.009
You mustn't think that way.

00:12:51.009 --> 00:12:54.009
I said I didn't give him children.

00:12:54.009 --> 00:12:56.009
Wither without children.

00:12:56.009 --> 00:13:01.289
Marriage is sacred. Trust in Jehovah.

00:13:01.289 --> 00:13:03.289
He will never send you away.

00:13:03.289 --> 00:13:43.250
Reham, we had a visitor last night.

00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:48.480
It was your wife.

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:51.860
Or should I say your former wife?

00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:55.860
Reham, don't you care how you've hurt your innocent mate?

00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:57.860
How can you be so hard-hearted?

00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:00.860
Look, Moses said if you find something indecent with your wife,

00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:02.860
a man must write a certificate of divorce,

00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:04.860
hand it to her, and dismiss her.

00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:08.860
If giving me no children is an indecent, then what is?

00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:11.860
Besides, I'm tired of living with her.

00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:13.860
I'm marrying Gisla today.

00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:15.860
Gisla.

00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:18.860
That mobile girl?

00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:20.860
I heard you bind yourself with an oath and a curse

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:22.860
not to take away from the nations.

00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:25.860
God's law says they will turn your sons away from following me

00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:27.860
to serve other gods.

00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:29.860
Then Jehovah's anger will blaze against you.

00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:32.860
Who are you to counsel me?

00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:36.860
Every man must find his own joy and I intend to find mine.

00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:40.860
Reham, only Jehovah can give true joy.

00:14:40.860 --> 00:15:06.870
Do you really think you can give yourself more joy than he can?

00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:11.870
Jehovah, why do we treat each other so treacherously,

00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:13.870
profaning your covenant?

00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:32.600
Malachi, say to the priests who are despising my name,

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:36.600
a son honors a father and a servant his master.

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:42.600
So if I am a father, where is the honor do me?

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:47.600
And if I am a master, where is the fear do me?

00:15:47.600 --> 00:16:01.820
My good man.

00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:03.820
My good man, we see you have no offer to him.

00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:31.909
I have you, Levites, despised Jehovah's name.

00:16:31.909 --> 00:16:33.909
despised it.

00:16:33.909 --> 00:16:34.909
How?

00:16:34.909 --> 00:16:38.909
You present a blind, lame or sick animal as a sacrifice?

00:16:38.909 --> 00:16:40.909
And say that it is nothing bad?

00:16:40.909 --> 00:16:42.909
Should Jehovah accept it from your hand?

00:16:42.909 --> 00:16:44.909
What's the meat is in our pot?

00:16:44.909 --> 00:16:46.909
No one can tell if it was lame or sound.

00:16:46.909 --> 00:16:48.909
What about Jehovah?

00:16:48.909 --> 00:16:50.909
Can he tell the difference?

00:16:50.909 --> 00:16:53.909
One day, Jehovah will come to his temple.

00:16:53.909 --> 00:16:56.909
He will cleanse you sons of Levi by fire.

00:16:56.909 --> 00:16:58.909
Malachi, what's gotten into you?

00:16:58.909 --> 00:17:03.909
Why should you complain when everyone else approves?

00:17:03.909 --> 00:17:07.910
Oh, priests, if you refuse to take it to heart, says Jehovah,

00:17:07.910 --> 00:17:13.910
I will send on you the curse and I will turn your blessings into curses.

00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:19.910
Return to me and I will return to you, says Jehovah.

00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:21.910
How are we supposed to return?

00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:24.910
Will a mere human rob God?

00:17:24.910 --> 00:17:27.910
But you are robbing me, says Jehovah.

00:17:27.910 --> 00:17:32.910
How have we robbed him in the tithes and in the contributions you are robbing me?

00:17:32.910 --> 00:17:37.910
Yes, the entire nation is, says Jehovah, bring the entire tithe into the storehouse.

00:17:37.910 --> 00:17:39.910
So there may be food in my house.

00:17:39.910 --> 00:17:41.910
And test me out, please.

00:17:41.910 --> 00:17:44.910
And see whether I will not open to you the floodgates of the heavens

00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:48.910
and pour out on you a blessing until there is nothing lacking.

00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:54.829
And there's another thing you do so that he no longer looks favorably on anything you offer.

00:17:54.829 --> 00:17:56.829
Why not?

00:17:56.829 --> 00:17:59.829
Because you betray the wife of your youth.

00:17:59.829 --> 00:18:02.829
Although she's your partner, your legal wife.

00:18:02.829 --> 00:18:07.829
There are some who don't do that because they have what remains of the spirit.

00:18:07.829 --> 00:18:10.829
So guard yourselves respecting your spirit.

00:18:10.829 --> 00:18:15.619
Do not deal treacherously with the wife of your youth.

00:18:15.619 --> 00:18:20.619
For I hate divorce, says Jehovah, the God of Israel.

00:18:20.619 --> 00:18:23.619
The lips of a priest should safeguard knowledge.

00:18:23.619 --> 00:18:26.619
And people should seek the law from his mouth.

00:18:26.619 --> 00:18:30.619
But you, you have made many stumble.

00:18:30.619 --> 00:18:43.259
Jehovah's message revealed the problem was in their hearts.

00:18:43.259 --> 00:18:51.309
In spite of that, Malachi sought out those who found joy in doing what was right.

00:18:51.309 --> 00:19:06.460
Pilate.

00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:07.460
Azuba.

00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:09.460
Don't despair.

00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:13.460
You will see the distinction between the righteous and the wicked.

00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:17.460
Between one who serves God and one who doesn't.

00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:19.460
You must be a prophet.

00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:21.460
I served Jehovah as you do.

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:25.460
And I can tell you that when you speak with one another about Jehovah,

00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:27.460
he pays attention.

00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:37.079
A book is written before him of those who fear him and meditate on his name.

00:19:37.079 --> 00:19:53.539
May Jehovah be with you.

00:19:53.539 --> 00:19:56.539
For years, I was away from Jerusalem.

00:19:56.539 --> 00:20:00.539
But my heart was always with my people.

00:20:00.539 --> 00:20:03.539
I requested to return to them.

00:20:03.539 --> 00:20:06.539
But what I found shocked me.

00:20:06.539 --> 00:20:10.180
A lie ship.

00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:11.180
May you have peace.

00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:13.180
Yeah, Maya.

00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:15.180
I wasn't expecting it.

00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:17.180
Where are the Levites and the Singers?

00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:20.180
Some of them are away right now.

00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:22.180
Away?

00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:23.180
Why are they away?

00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:26.099
Padaya is here.

00:20:26.099 --> 00:20:28.099
Padaya.

00:20:28.099 --> 00:20:30.099
Showed Governor Nehemiah around.

00:20:30.099 --> 00:20:35.839
Excuse me, please.

00:20:35.839 --> 00:20:37.839
Of course.

00:20:37.839 --> 00:20:46.089
Padaya, tell me about the temple services.

00:20:46.089 --> 00:20:48.089
Do you have all the provisions that you need?

00:20:48.089 --> 00:20:51.089
Governor Nehemiah, we have nearly no provisions at all.

00:20:51.089 --> 00:20:52.089
How can that be?

00:20:52.089 --> 00:20:57.089
For a long time, the priests and the Levites have not taken their duties seriously.

00:20:57.089 --> 00:21:00.089
When the people saw that, they stopped bringing in tithes.

00:21:00.089 --> 00:21:05.089
Without the tithes, most Levites and singers returned to their fields.

00:21:05.089 --> 00:21:07.089
Why have you not returned?

00:21:07.089 --> 00:21:10.339
My Lord, I'm getting by.

00:21:10.339 --> 00:21:13.339
I've always believed that Jehovah helps those who trust in him.

00:21:13.339 --> 00:21:17.339
I know he will correct things in his time.

00:21:17.339 --> 00:21:21.339
Did Alayashib not tell the people to bring your provisions?

00:21:21.339 --> 00:21:26.339
In your absence, the prophet Malachi warned him and all the priests.

00:21:26.339 --> 00:21:32.339
But Alayashib, he took our storeroom, emptied it of our provisions.

00:21:32.339 --> 00:21:35.339
He gave it to Baya to use as a dining hall.

00:21:35.339 --> 00:21:50.329
Padaya, help us get rid of these things.

00:21:50.329 --> 00:22:01.740
What are you doing? Alayashib?

00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:03.740
What have you been doing?

00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:06.740
Why have you in the deputy rulers neglected the House of God?

00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:11.740
You and they please cleanse this room and replace the utensils.

00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:12.740
Yes, ma'am.

00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:15.740
And gather all the Levites, the singers, the deputy rulers to me.

00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:17.740
I'm assigning them all back to their posts.

00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:22.740
Padaya, I'm placing you, Shalamai, and Zaidak in charge of the storeroom.

00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:23.740
Hainan will be your assistant.

00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:26.740
It's your responsibility to distribute provisions to your brothers.

00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:29.740
Yamai, wait a second.

00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:30.740
Let me explain.

00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:34.740
I will tell all Judah to bring in the tent of the grain,

00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:37.740
the new wine, and the oil.

00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:39.740
I can explain.

00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:42.119
No way.

00:22:42.119 --> 00:22:57.180
Do remember me, oh my God.

00:22:57.180 --> 00:23:02.180
Do not wipe out my acts of loyal love for the House of my God.

00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:11.660
Not only have they neglected Jehovah's House,

00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:14.660
some of the Jews continued to conduct business on the Sabbath.

00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:19.289
A day Jehovah had declared as holy.

00:23:19.289 --> 00:23:24.259
Where are you selling today?

00:23:24.259 --> 00:23:29.259
Only the best quality fish from tired.

00:23:29.259 --> 00:23:31.259
What are you doing?

00:23:31.259 --> 00:23:33.259
Do you not care that this is the Sabbath?

00:23:33.259 --> 00:23:40.720
Yamai, what is this evil thing you're doing?

00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:42.720
That's why God brought disaster on the city.

00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:44.720
People think it's acceptable now.

00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:46.720
What does Jehovah think?

00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:49.720
I stopped the buying and selling,

00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:54.720
and ordered the doors closed so as to keep the Sabbath day holy.

00:23:54.720 --> 00:24:07.099
But the following week, the merchants try it again.

00:24:07.099 --> 00:24:09.099
What's the meaning of this?

00:24:09.099 --> 00:24:11.099
I had to sleep on the ground last night.

00:24:11.099 --> 00:24:13.099
You know God's law?

00:24:13.099 --> 00:24:14.099
No work?

00:24:14.099 --> 00:24:15.099
No business?

00:24:15.099 --> 00:24:17.099
On the Sabbath?

00:24:17.099 --> 00:24:18.099
Go!

00:24:18.099 --> 00:24:21.099
You know the Levi's guard the gates and keep the Sabbath holy.

00:24:21.099 --> 00:24:23.099
Don't let anyone in.

00:24:23.099 --> 00:24:36.650
This too, remember to my credit, oh my God,

00:24:36.650 --> 00:24:40.650
and show me pity according to your abundant loyal love.

00:24:40.650 --> 00:24:48.000
There was another thing that I had to do.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:53.230
Come back here.

00:24:53.230 --> 00:24:56.230
You have to listen to me, I'm your father.

00:24:56.230 --> 00:24:58.230
What's wrong with your children?

00:24:58.230 --> 00:25:01.230
They don't like coming to the temple.

00:25:01.230 --> 00:25:03.230
Oh, sweetie.

00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:05.230
Why don't you like it?

00:25:05.230 --> 00:25:07.230
So what got you?

00:25:07.230 --> 00:25:13.259
Come back here now!

00:25:13.259 --> 00:25:15.259
I'm sorry, my lord.

00:25:15.259 --> 00:25:18.740
My wife speaks very little Hebrew.

00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:19.740
Did you not swear?

00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:22.740
Never to marry someone who doesn't serve Jehovah?

00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:25.740
Yeah, Maya, nobody cares.

00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:27.740
Did you not?

00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:28.740
Yes, yes.

00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:32.740
Why have you ignored the command of Jehovah and your own oath?

00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:33.740
Let me go.

00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:36.740
No wonder your children don't love Jehovah.

00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:40.740
Did you imagine that you could succeed without Jehovah's blessing?

00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:42.740
I prayed for Jehovah's blessing.

00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:43.740
Did you?

00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:45.740
But you didn't obey him.

00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:53.329
Rahim, how can Jehovah bless something that is against his will?

00:25:53.329 --> 00:25:55.329
Why was I surprised?

00:25:55.329 --> 00:26:00.329
The people were just following the bad example of those taking the lead.

00:26:00.329 --> 00:26:03.329
Eliaship's grandson married to Horonite.

00:26:03.329 --> 00:26:05.329
The daughter of Sin Ballet.

00:26:05.329 --> 00:26:19.400
Have you no respect for God's law?

00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:21.400
You should not give your daughters their sons.

00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:25.400
Nor accept any of their daughters for your sons.

00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:28.869
Or yourselves.

00:26:28.869 --> 00:26:34.720
Was it not because of these that King Solomon sinned?

00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:36.720
Grandfather, say something.

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:37.720
Be still in my son.

00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:49.039
Is it not something unheard of for you to commit this great evil by marrying foreign women?

00:26:49.039 --> 00:26:52.349
You have to file the priesthood.

00:26:52.349 --> 00:26:54.349
You may not serve as a priest.

00:26:54.349 --> 00:26:56.349
Nor remain in Jerusalem.

00:26:56.349 --> 00:27:02.670
Fine.

00:27:02.670 --> 00:27:04.670
I'll go to Samaria.

00:27:04.670 --> 00:27:06.670
They're more tolerant there.

00:27:06.670 --> 00:27:13.450
But he's my grandson.

00:27:13.450 --> 00:27:17.450
Then why did you allow him to disregard Jehovah's laws?

00:27:17.450 --> 00:27:20.819
You know.

00:27:20.819 --> 00:27:25.819
Our temple services are what preserves our relationship with God.

00:27:25.819 --> 00:27:28.819
But as soon as I left,

00:27:28.819 --> 00:27:33.579
all of you, you let it fall apart.

00:27:33.579 --> 00:27:47.039
It took some time,

00:27:47.039 --> 00:27:51.039
but true worship was restored.

00:27:51.039 --> 00:28:08.380
When I look back on all that Jehovah enabled us to do,

00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:15.279
despite the opposition we faced,

00:28:15.279 --> 00:28:21.279
I recommend we turn the accusation of the sedition against Nehemiah.

00:28:21.279 --> 00:28:24.279
Next sound they hear will be our battle cry.

00:28:24.279 --> 00:28:28.279
Are you gonna wait until they start killing us?

00:28:28.279 --> 00:28:30.279
The bad influences we avoided.

00:28:30.279 --> 00:28:32.279
I have a right to live where I choose.

00:28:32.279 --> 00:28:33.279
And so do you.

00:28:33.279 --> 00:28:35.279
I need you to join me in refusing to move.

00:28:35.279 --> 00:28:36.279
Don't waste your money.

00:28:36.279 --> 00:28:37.279
Be practical.

00:28:37.279 --> 00:28:39.279
Besides, it's only a tradition.

00:28:39.279 --> 00:28:41.279
If we want to eat,

00:28:41.279 --> 00:28:43.279
we need to attend our own flocks and fields.

00:28:43.279 --> 00:28:45.279
It's of no value to serve God.

00:28:45.279 --> 00:28:47.279
The sleepless nights.

00:28:47.279 --> 00:28:50.279
We must go to Jerusalem to keep an eye on Nehemiah.

00:28:50.279 --> 00:28:52.279
Don't you see these people hate what we're doing?

00:28:52.279 --> 00:28:53.279
They hate us.

00:28:53.279 --> 00:28:56.279
They have to live and work around them like we do.

00:28:56.279 --> 00:28:58.279
The sweat and toil.

00:28:58.279 --> 00:29:00.279
Besides, this work is too much for us.

00:29:00.279 --> 00:29:01.279
We're worn out.

00:29:01.279 --> 00:29:03.279
Why do we need a wall anyway?

00:29:03.279 --> 00:29:06.279
I just remember the joy we felt.

00:29:06.279 --> 00:29:10.910
Because we were serving Jehovah the right way.

00:29:10.910 --> 00:29:18.230
We thought we were just working on a wall.

00:29:18.230 --> 00:29:28.880
But Jehovah was rebuilding our faith.

00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:31.880
I'll never forget how Jehovah brought us together

00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:33.880
to accomplish his will.

00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:41.549
He taught us to rely on him.

00:29:41.549 --> 00:29:43.549
And he strengthened us.

00:29:43.549 --> 00:29:45.549
Eat the choice things.

00:29:45.549 --> 00:29:47.549
And drink what is sweet.

00:29:47.549 --> 00:29:49.549
And send portion to those who have nothing.

00:29:49.549 --> 00:29:52.549
And do not feel sad.

00:29:52.549 --> 00:29:56.549
For the joy of Jehovah is your stronghold.

00:29:56.549 --> 00:30:09.369
Do remember me favorably.

00:30:09.369 --> 00:30:10.369
Oh my God.

00:30:10.369 --> 00:30:24.880
Nehemiah was a man of courage.

00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:28.880
He could have stayed in the luxurious palace of Shushan

00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:32.880
and served Jehovah from there, but he didn't.

00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:37.880
When a need arose, he was ready to make the long journey

00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:40.880
to Jerusalem to support his brothers.

00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:42.880
But it wouldn't be easy.

00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:46.880
First he had to ask the king of Persia to let him go.

00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:50.880
What helped Nehemiah to be a courageous person for Jehovah?

00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:55.880
Did he rely on his personality or his good record with the king?

00:30:56.880 --> 00:31:00.319
Let's watch this part again.

00:31:00.319 --> 00:31:03.319
The place where my forefathers are buried lies in ruins.

00:31:03.319 --> 00:31:05.319
And its gates have been consumed by fire.

00:31:05.319 --> 00:31:07.319
Nehemiah, what is this?

00:31:07.319 --> 00:31:10.319
Speak frankly, what are you seeking?

00:31:10.319 --> 00:31:16.019
At once I prayed to the God of the heavens

00:31:16.019 --> 00:31:22.220
if it pleases the king.

00:31:22.220 --> 00:31:25.220
And if your servant has found favor with you,

00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:31.170
send me to Judah to the city where my forefathers are buried

00:31:31.170 --> 00:31:33.170
and let me rebuild it.

00:31:33.170 --> 00:31:41.630
You may go.

00:31:41.630 --> 00:31:43.630
Jehovah was with us.

00:31:43.630 --> 00:31:52.119
Nehemiah immediately and humbly prayed to Jehovah,

00:31:52.119 --> 00:31:54.119
the true source of courage.

00:31:54.119 --> 00:31:58.119
In fact, he prayed repeatedly throughout his assignment

00:31:58.119 --> 00:32:01.119
and Jehovah blessed his efforts.

00:32:01.119 --> 00:32:04.119
So lesson number one for us today.

00:32:04.119 --> 00:32:08.119
When times are hard, we may be quick to lean on Jehovah.

00:32:08.119 --> 00:32:11.119
But what if things are going well?

00:32:11.119 --> 00:32:14.119
Are we still reliant on Jehovah?

00:32:14.119 --> 00:32:18.119
Or might we find ourselves becoming complacent?

00:32:18.119 --> 00:32:23.119
Perhaps even saying, things are good in my life now.

00:32:23.119 --> 00:32:26.119
I know there's a need to get to work.

00:32:26.119 --> 00:32:30.119
But I've been serving Jehovah for many years now.

00:32:30.119 --> 00:32:32.119
I've done my part.

00:32:32.119 --> 00:32:35.119
Let someone else do it.

00:32:35.119 --> 00:32:38.119
Will Jehovah bless such an attitude?

00:32:38.119 --> 00:32:42.119
Wouldn't it be better to turn to Jehovah in prayer,

00:32:42.119 --> 00:32:48.119
asking him to give you the courage and joy to continue to reach out

00:32:48.119 --> 00:32:51.119
in your service to him?

00:32:51.119 --> 00:32:58.119
You just might be surprised at the door Jehovah opens for you.

00:32:58.119 --> 00:33:01.119
Now, once Nehemiah arrived in Jerusalem,

00:33:01.119 --> 00:33:05.119
he didn't just give orders, did he?

00:33:05.119 --> 00:33:10.119
The Bible says that he daily worked alongside his fellow Israelites

00:33:10.119 --> 00:33:15.119
from the break of dawn until the stars came out.

00:33:15.119 --> 00:33:20.119
In a similar way, when we show a self-sacrificing spirit,

00:33:20.119 --> 00:33:26.119
Jehovah will give us the energy needed to carry out the task at hand.

00:33:26.119 --> 00:33:31.119
The Israelites completed the wall building project in just 52 days.

00:33:31.119 --> 00:33:39.119
What an amazing feat, especially in the face of continual opposition.

00:33:39.119 --> 00:33:42.119
At first, it came in the form of mocking.

00:33:42.119 --> 00:33:46.119
Then the opposers threatened to attack.

00:33:46.119 --> 00:33:51.119
There were Samaritans in the North, Ammonites in the East,

00:33:51.119 --> 00:33:56.119
Arabs in the South, and Ashtadites in the West.

00:33:56.119 --> 00:34:00.119
Jerusalem was surrounded by enemies.

00:34:00.119 --> 00:34:04.119
It could have been easy to feel trapped and to give in to fear.

00:34:04.119 --> 00:34:06.119
What did Nehemiah do?

00:34:06.119 --> 00:34:09.119
Well, what was his pattern?

00:34:09.119 --> 00:34:11.119
In his own words, he says,

00:34:11.119 --> 00:34:15.119
we prayed to our God.

00:34:15.119 --> 00:34:19.119
Then Nehemiah strengthened the people by telling them

00:34:19.119 --> 00:34:23.119
do not be afraid of them.

00:34:23.119 --> 00:34:28.119
Remember Jehovah, who is great and awe-inspiring.

00:34:28.119 --> 00:34:31.119
And so they kept building.

00:34:31.119 --> 00:34:35.119
After Nehemiah's enemies realized that their open threats had failed,

00:34:35.119 --> 00:34:37.119
did they give up?

00:34:37.119 --> 00:34:38.119
No.

00:34:38.119 --> 00:34:42.119
They now turn to other forms of opposition.

00:34:42.119 --> 00:34:49.119
In fact, they tried three different schemes to sidetrack Nehemiah from the work.

00:34:49.119 --> 00:34:51.119
Did you notice them?

00:34:51.119 --> 00:34:53.119
Let's watch the video again.

00:34:53.119 --> 00:35:02.010
They asked to meet Nehemiah halfway.

00:35:02.010 --> 00:35:05.010
Tell this to Nehemiah.

00:35:05.010 --> 00:35:11.010
Come and let us set a time to meet together in the valley plain of Ono.

00:35:11.010 --> 00:35:17.400
They're trying to lure me away from Jerusalem to do the harm.

00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:20.400
They spread false rumors.

00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:24.400
Geesham, it's time to implement your plan.

00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:28.400
Tobiah, write this down.

00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:31.400
Among the nations, it has been heard.

00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:40.400
And Geesham is also saying that you and the Jews are scheming to rebel.

00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:43.400
That is why you are building the wall.

00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:49.099
And they used a traitor to try and trick Nehemiah.

00:35:49.099 --> 00:35:51.099
They're coming to kill you.

00:35:51.099 --> 00:35:56.099
By night, we must go into the temple and close the doors.

00:35:56.099 --> 00:35:59.099
Shemaah, should a man like me run away?

00:35:59.099 --> 00:36:01.099
You don't understand.

00:36:01.099 --> 00:36:04.099
What would that do to the spirit of the entire nation?

00:36:04.099 --> 00:36:06.099
It's the only safe place.

00:36:06.099 --> 00:36:09.099
Besides, I'm not a priest.

00:36:09.099 --> 00:36:12.099
If I entered the temple, that would be valid reason to kill me.

00:36:12.099 --> 00:36:15.099
I will not go in.

00:36:15.099 --> 00:36:17.099
That decision would be foolish, Nehemiah.

00:36:17.099 --> 00:36:25.659
Oh, I see.

00:36:25.659 --> 00:36:30.659
Tobiah and San Ballet put you up to this dint they you hypocrite.

00:36:30.659 --> 00:36:32.659
Made you hover remember them?

00:36:32.659 --> 00:36:36.659
And all of you false prophets who keep trying to frighten me.

00:36:36.659 --> 00:36:37.659
Come here Nehemiah.

00:36:37.659 --> 00:36:44.039
We have work to do.

00:36:44.039 --> 00:36:47.039
Three schemes, three failures.

00:36:47.039 --> 00:36:50.039
So lesson number two.

00:36:50.039 --> 00:36:59.039
Like Nehemiah, we might encounter opposers who scheme to bring our loyal service to a halt.

00:36:59.039 --> 00:37:03.039
Some may invite us to meet them halfway, so to speak.

00:37:03.039 --> 00:37:09.039
They may try to convince us that if we served Jehovah with just a little less zeal,

00:37:09.039 --> 00:37:14.039
we could pursue worldly goals at the same time.

00:37:14.039 --> 00:37:18.039
However, because God's kingdom comes first in our lives,

00:37:18.039 --> 00:37:22.039
we can be like Nehemiah and refuse to compromise.

00:37:22.039 --> 00:37:25.039
We know where this world's hidden.

00:37:25.039 --> 00:37:30.929
Opposers also spread false accusations against us.

00:37:30.929 --> 00:37:34.929
In some lands, we're accused of posing a threat to the state.

00:37:34.929 --> 00:37:39.929
Some accusations have been successfully rebutted in court.

00:37:39.929 --> 00:37:47.929
But whatever the outcome, we're confident that Jehovah will direct matters according to his will.

00:37:47.929 --> 00:37:53.929
Opposition may also come from those who pretend to serve Jehovah.

00:37:53.929 --> 00:37:59.929
Just as a fellow Jew tried to get Nehemiah to break God's law to save his life,

00:37:59.929 --> 00:38:06.929
so former witnesses may try to get us to compromise in one way or another.

00:38:06.929 --> 00:38:12.929
However, we reject apostates because we know that our lives are saved,

00:38:12.929 --> 00:38:17.929
not by breaking God's laws, but by keeping them.

00:38:17.929 --> 00:38:23.929
Each time Nehemiah refused to fall into their trap, why?

00:38:23.929 --> 00:38:26.929
Because he had a brilliant mind? No.

00:38:26.929 --> 00:38:34.929
It was because he relied on Jehovah and Jehovah gave him the insight needed

00:38:34.929 --> 00:38:38.929
to see through their deceptions.

00:38:38.929 --> 00:38:42.929
After the walls built, Nehemiah left Jerusalem for a while.

00:38:42.929 --> 00:38:46.929
But what did he find on his return?

00:38:46.929 --> 00:38:53.929
Instead of coming back to find true worship thriving, he found it barely surviving.

00:38:53.929 --> 00:38:59.929
All the work that he had done to help the people to trust Jehovah.

00:38:59.929 --> 00:39:02.929
How do you think he felt?

00:39:02.929 --> 00:39:06.929
He could have said, that's it. I'm out.

00:39:06.929 --> 00:39:10.929
Let someone else clean this up and walk away.

00:39:10.929 --> 00:39:13.929
But did he? Let's watch again.

00:39:13.929 --> 00:39:17.929
Why have you and the deputy rulers neglected the House of God?

00:39:17.929 --> 00:39:20.929
You and they please cleanse this room.

00:39:20.929 --> 00:39:26.929
You know God's law, no work, no business on the Sabbath.

00:39:26.929 --> 00:39:27.929
Go!

00:39:27.929 --> 00:39:33.929
Did you not swear, never to marry someone who doesn't serve Jehovah?

00:39:33.929 --> 00:39:38.929
Then why have you ignored the command of Jehovah and your own oath?

00:39:38.929 --> 00:39:44.929
Also, the Lyashib's grandson married a Hora Knight. The daughter of San Ballet.

00:39:44.929 --> 00:39:52.489
You should not give your daughters their sons, nor accept any of their daughters for your sons.

00:39:52.489 --> 00:39:59.489
You have to file the priesthood. You may not serve as a priest, nor remain in Jerusalem.

00:39:59.489 --> 00:40:05.489
It took some time, but true worship was restored.

00:40:05.489 --> 00:40:13.289
Nehemiah didn't walk away, did he?

00:40:13.289 --> 00:40:17.289
No, he persevered in his assignment. Why?

00:40:17.289 --> 00:40:21.289
Because he held on to his joy.

00:40:21.289 --> 00:40:27.289
You see, his main source of joy came not from his accomplishments,

00:40:27.289 --> 00:40:33.289
not from the security of walls, nor even from what others were doing.

00:40:33.289 --> 00:40:37.289
From where does true joy come?

00:40:37.289 --> 00:40:45.289
Nehemiah himself told us, the joy of Jehovah is your stronghold.

00:40:45.289 --> 00:40:48.289
So here's lesson number three for us.

00:40:48.289 --> 00:40:57.289
Despite challenges and setbacks, we can be joyful because true joy comes from a good relationship with Jehovah.

00:40:57.289 --> 00:41:01.289
Nehemiah was a man like you and me.

00:41:01.289 --> 00:41:08.289
Remember, he didn't have Jehovah's power displayed supernaturally to him like Moses and Joshua did.

00:41:08.289 --> 00:41:17.289
But what did he have? He had prayer. He had faith. And he had trust.

00:41:17.289 --> 00:41:24.289
Those were his tools. And there's no doubt that Jehovah was active on behalf of Nehemiah,

00:41:24.289 --> 00:41:27.289
guiding and blessing his efforts.

00:41:27.289 --> 00:41:34.289
We have those same tools today. Pray to Jehovah, put faith in him,

00:41:34.289 --> 00:41:38.289
and trust that he will bless yourself sacrificing efforts,

00:41:38.289 --> 00:41:44.289
just as Jehovah gave Nehemiah the courage, the energy, the insight,

00:41:44.289 --> 00:41:50.289
and the perseverance to carry out his assignment, he'll do the same for you.
