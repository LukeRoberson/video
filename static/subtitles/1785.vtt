00:00:01.389 --> 00:00:09.390
Approaching strangers and engaging them in conversation about the Bible can be a challenge.

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:10.390
Why?

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:16.390
One reason is because some of us are more reserved than others.

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.390
We are pleased to introduce Sister Lorraine E. Jackson.

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:25.390
Sister Jackson has been serving for many years in special full-time service

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.390
and visiting a variety of lands with her husband Jeffrey.

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:38.640
Sister Jackson, at first, when you learned the truth in Fiji as a young person,

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.640
how did you feel about sharing in the ministry?

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.640
Brother Malin Flandt, I am shy and reserved by nature.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:54.640
And I remember that when I first learned that Jehovah wants us to preach his good news,

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:00.640
I was excited, but even more so, I was terrified.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:08.640
I understood that preaching would mean approaching strangers and trying to have conversations with them,

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.640
often when they least expected it.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.640
And really all I wanted to do was just be quiet and be on my own.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.640
I think there are many brothers and sisters who feel the same way.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.640
What helped you to share in the ministry more fully?

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.640
I think the main thing that has helped me is relying on Jehovah's help through prayer.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.640
Like many others, I talked to Jehovah constantly about my struggles.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:44.640
The struggle to say the right thing, the struggle to not show fear in my manner or my voice.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.640
The struggle to remember the right scriptures to use and to use them will.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:56.640
And of course, if someone is rude to try and remain calm and kind.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.640
Your words are appreciated.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:05.640
Tell us, what are some of the things that bring you joy in the ministry?

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:11.639
The things that bring you joy are the very things I could not have done without Jehovah's help.

00:02:11.639 --> 00:02:18.639
Things like conversing freely with people, strangers, about Jehovah and the Bible.

00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:22.639
And then having the opportunity to see people's eyes light up,

00:02:22.639 --> 00:02:27.639
when they read or understand the Bible verse for the first time,

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:29.639
I think those are really precious.

00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:33.639
And of course, helping a Bible student works through a problem

00:02:33.639 --> 00:02:36.639
and then also trying to become their friend.

00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:41.639
I think things like these really show Jehovah's power and support

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:44.639
and all I can do is thank him for them.

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:48.639
That's very encouraging for all of us, Sister Jackson.

00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:56.639
My final question is, how do you feel about participating in various aspects of the ministry?

00:02:56.639 --> 00:03:02.639
I know I still lack so much, but I'm so grateful for the opportunity I've been given

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:05.639
to participate in various aspects of the ministry,

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:10.639
because they've allowed me to help others start their own journeys

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:17.639
to becoming Jehovah's friend and also give me an opportunity to work with Jehovah

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:20.639
and really rely on him.

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:28.639
I feel the ministry helps one, especially if one is shy, to focus on others,

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:32.639
on Jehovah, on Jesus, on people and their needs,

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:36.639
and not so much on one's own limitations.

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:40.639
It's true, I'm still very reserved and shy,

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:44.639
and as those close to me know, some days are good,

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:49.639
and other days I feel like hiding somewhere and not saying much.

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:53.639
However, the ministry has helped me manage my shyness

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:58.639
and has helped train me to accept other assignments of service.

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:03.639
I am convinced that anyone, whether a timid or otherwise,

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:06.639
can rejoice in the ministry,

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:12.639
provided they rely constantly on Jehovah and focus on him.

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:18.639
Thank you very much, Sister Jackson, for such encouraging expressions of faith.

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:23.269
Jehovah is there to help us.

00:04:23.269 --> 00:04:28.269
If we trust in him and put forth a sincere effort to give of ourselves

00:04:28.269 --> 00:04:31.269
in the preaching activity.
