00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:07.730
Brother Mark Sanderson has labored over his material and is looking forward to

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:14.810
presenting his talk. It's entitled, Your Labor is not in vain. Brother Sanderson,

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:24.210
you have our ears. The date was September 8th, 1922, Cedar Point, Ohio. Brother

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.969
Rutherford, before that assembled crowd, said those words that still ring in

00:00:28.969 --> 00:00:36.170
our ears. He said, Behold, the King reigns. You are his publicity agents.

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:45.530
Therefore, advertise, advertise, advertise the King and his kingdom. Well, what a

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:52.090
call to action that was by Brother Rutherford. And in those few words, Brother

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:58.570
Rutherford showed that he recognized something that is very important. The

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:04.930
faithful men and women that were in that audience, and so many others who have

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:11.329
followed them since, were to be Jehovah's publicity agents. They were to be

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:18.489
preachers and teachers of the good news of God's kingdom. Now, that's a simple

00:01:18.489 --> 00:01:27.209
fact, but it reveals something amazing about our Heavenly Father, Jehovah. Although

00:01:27.209 --> 00:01:37.409
He is so almighty, although just one angel could kill 185,000 in one night, we

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.530
know Jehovah could use any miraculous means in order to accomplish this

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:51.849
preaching work. But how has Jehovah chosen to accomplish it? By using imperfect

00:01:51.849 --> 00:01:59.489
ordinary men and women like you and like me in order to accomplish the greatest

00:01:59.489 --> 00:02:05.769
preaching work that has ever been accomplished in history? It reminds us of what

00:02:05.769 --> 00:02:09.889
the Apostle Paul wrote here in 1 Corinthians chapter 1. Will you open your

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:20.699
Bibles and read it with me? 1 Corinthians 1 in verse 26, the Apostle Paul said,

00:02:21.219 --> 00:02:25.699
For you see his calling of you, brothers, that there are not many in a

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:33.139
wise and a fleshly way, not many powerful, not many of noble birth. But God

00:02:33.139 --> 00:02:39.060
shows the foolish things of the world to put the wise men to shame. And God

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.780
shows the weak things of the world to put the strong things to shame. And God

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.860
shows the insignificant things of the world. And the things looked down on. The

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:56.580
things that are not to bring to nothing the things that are so that no one might

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:04.099
boast in the sight of God. Well, perhaps those in Corinth thought that being a

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:10.060
new movement that the Jehovah would raise up people who are powerful, people from

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:16.580
important families, people who had great worldly wisdom, but that was not the

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:21.659
means that Jehovah was going to use. He was going to use people who were

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:29.300
described as unlettered and ordinary. Well, for what purpose? Well, really to

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:35.460
magnify him, to magnify his almightiness, that he could use these imperfect

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:42.099
people to accomplish this tremendous work. And really, so that no human could

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:46.620
ever boast in what was accomplished. Well, when those words of Brother

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:52.020
Brotherford went out, that call to action, our brothers got busy. Brother

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:58.060
Melvin Sargent, who was baptized in 1912, and who was present there in Cedar Point

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:03.580
to hear those words, said this, those of us inside the Lord's organization have

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:10.020
tried in every way possible to turn their attention to the message of life. We

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:16.740
have used slogans, full-page advertisements, radio, sound cars, portable

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:22.819
phonographs, gigantic conventions, parades of information walkers carrying

00:04:22.819 --> 00:04:29.620
signs, and a growing army of house to house ministers. How true? And perhaps

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:34.139
some of you shared in some of those different activities and you used those

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:41.620
tools. Well, what about today? Today, brothers, we have amazing tools to help

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.540
us to accomplish the work. Things that we could never even have imagined,

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:55.139
JW.org, the JW Library app, our language app, JW Broadcasting, as well as

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:59.779
literature that's now available in literally hundreds and hundreds of

00:04:59.779 --> 00:05:08.019
languages. But, brothers, no matter how wonderful any of these tools are, no

00:05:08.019 --> 00:05:15.139
matter how many tools we ever produce, we cannot forget one simple point, tools

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:23.939
need users. And that means that every one of you, every publisher of the good

00:05:23.939 --> 00:05:30.980
news of God's kingdom, is absolutely essential, is absolutely needed to

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:45.750
accomplish this work. Do you agree with me? And we have to say that as a

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:51.709
governing body, as we travel, we see you preaching boldly from house to house.

00:05:51.709 --> 00:05:57.750
We see your literature carts and airports on public corners in train stations.

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:03.990
The work that you are accomplishing is amazing. And you are to be commended for

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:08.670
your hard work in preaching. It's much like the Apostle Paul said here in

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:16.990
1 Corinthians chapter 15 and verse 58. He said, therefore my beloved brothers be

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:23.509
steadfast, immovable, always having plenty to do in the work of the Lord,

00:06:23.509 --> 00:06:30.110
knowing that your labor is not in vain in connection with the Lord. Well,

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:35.110
that's what you're doing. You see, you have plenty to do in the work of the

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:42.430
Lord. But let's ask another question. We know, of course, that our labor is not

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:49.790
in vain. But could we, from time to time, come to that wrong conclusion? Could we

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:56.709
begin to think that our labor really is in vain? Well, let's consider three

00:06:56.709 --> 00:07:02.470
different areas where we might wrongfully come to that conclusion. Here's the

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:11.870
first. With the advancing age, with increasing health challenges, we may begin to

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:19.189
think, well, my voice is really very, very small. I really cannot contribute very

00:07:19.189 --> 00:07:25.149
much anymore to the preaching of the good news. Well, if that's the way you may

00:07:25.269 --> 00:07:31.189
have felt, it might be encouraging to think about what we did today, the release of our

00:07:31.189 --> 00:07:39.629
brand new songbook. Now, isn't it true? We love to listen to our choral singing. But

00:07:39.629 --> 00:07:45.189
now, when you listen to that choral singing, what is it that makes it beautiful? Is it

00:07:45.189 --> 00:07:53.189
the fact that there's two or three loud booming voices that overpower everyone? No. The

00:07:53.189 --> 00:08:00.670
beauty lies in all of the voices coming together, harmonizing, making beautiful

00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:07.910
music that praises Jehovah. So, what can we learn from that? Well, you see, whether

00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:16.509
our voice is loud or whether our voice is very soft or very small, we all can

00:08:16.509 --> 00:08:22.449
contribute to this wonderful chorus that's being sung around this earth to praise

00:08:22.449 --> 00:08:28.449
Jehovah. And as brothers explained so nicely mentioned in his talk, the principle of

00:08:28.449 --> 00:08:35.929
2 Corinthians chapter 8 and verse 12 must be very powerful in our minds. You see there,

00:08:35.929 --> 00:08:43.730
the Apostle Paul said, for if the readiness is there first, it is especially acceptable

00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:50.289
according to what a person has and not according to what a person does not have. When,

00:08:50.289 --> 00:08:55.090
now, of course, we apply that to many different types of giving. We apply it to our literal

00:08:55.090 --> 00:09:02.009
contributions of material things, but we also can apply it to our use of our time, our

00:09:02.009 --> 00:09:08.370
energy, our abilities, everything that we give for the preaching of this good news.

00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:15.769
So the question is, not what do you not have, but the question is what do you have? Do

00:09:15.769 --> 00:09:23.330
you have a voice? Well, whether it's strong or soft, use it. Continue to use it to praise

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:30.929
Jehovah. If you use sign language to communicate, well, then use your hands to be able to

00:09:30.929 --> 00:09:37.649
tell others about the good news of God's kingdom. Just recently, a brother sent me an experience

00:09:37.649 --> 00:09:46.929
of a Bible student in India who is both deaf and also was born with no arms. Now, how can

00:09:46.929 --> 00:09:53.850
this man communicate? Can you imagine? He's learned to do sign language with his feet,

00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:59.570
and he is able to communicate and express his voice in that way. Isn't that wonderful?

00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:08.250
We can use what we have to praise Jehovah. And I have to say, the governing body deeply

00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:14.529
appreciate all of the hard work that you, brothers, are doing, whether your voices loud

00:10:14.529 --> 00:10:21.009
and strong or quite weak. We appreciate every one of you and the work that you're doing

00:10:21.009 --> 00:10:25.690
in preaching the good news of God's kingdom.

00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:32.769
But now, let's talk about a second area where we might think that our labor is in vain.

00:10:32.769 --> 00:10:39.289
This is when we say, well, someone's work is really far better than mine. They can do

00:10:39.289 --> 00:10:46.570
so much more than I can. Well, it is a human tendency for us to want to compare ourselves

00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:52.409
with others. But what is the counsel that we have from God's Word in this regard? Let's

00:10:52.409 --> 00:11:07.019
read Galatians chapter 6, and verse 4, Galatians 6, and verse 4 says, but let each one examine

00:11:07.019 --> 00:11:15.340
his own actions. And then he will have cause for rejoicing in regard to himself alone and

00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:23.659
not in comparison with the other person. Yes, we have to look at what we can do and what we can

00:11:23.659 --> 00:11:30.460
contribute to the work ourselves. And in this regard, we have a beautiful example that comes

00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:35.899
from our modern day history that I'd like to share with you. It's the example of a brother

00:11:35.899 --> 00:11:43.980
named Adolf Weber. Now, brother Weber was baptized in Allegheny, Pennsylvania all the way back

00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:51.899
in the year 1890. Now, that's a long time ago, isn't it? Now, who was this man? He was a Swiss

00:11:51.899 --> 00:11:57.980
woodcutter. He had come to America, and he worked with brother Russell as a gardener.

00:11:59.019 --> 00:12:03.419
He obtained a very deep knowledge of the scriptures from working with brother Russell.

00:12:04.139 --> 00:12:10.940
After a time, brother Weber wanted, with all his heart, to go back to Europe and begin preaching

00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:18.139
in the French language territories. But now, who was he? Well, the yearbook, I'll quote it,

00:12:18.139 --> 00:12:22.539
I won't try to make any judgments because I didn't know what brother Weber. But here's what it said.

00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:30.860
Brother Weber was a simple man of peasant-like appearance. Well, if you see his picture in the

00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:38.940
Proclamers book, you might agree with that. But at the same time, the yearbook said he was a devout

00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:46.860
mature Christian who knew well the English, French, and German languages. In fact, he translated

00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:53.019
the studies in the scriptures and other early publications into French. Well, as soon as he got

00:12:53.019 --> 00:13:00.620
back to Switzerland, brother Weber got busy. He placed advertisements in French language religious

00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:05.899
newspapers and magazines for volume one of the studies in the scriptures and other books of

00:13:05.899 --> 00:13:12.379
brother Russell. Well, as a result, people began to order brother Russell's publications. They

00:13:12.379 --> 00:13:19.740
began to subscribe to the Watchtower in French. Brother Weber went on big preaching campaigns.

00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:25.820
He would go through Switzerland, placing tracts. He would go to France and Belgium. And he would

00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:31.980
meet with people who had ordered literature or who had subscribed for the Watchtower, all the while

00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:41.580
supporting himself by doing woodcutting or gardening. But now, were all of these efforts blessed by

00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:49.580
Jehovah? Yes, because throughout that territory in Switzerland, in France and Belgium, many began to

00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:58.860
associate and began to serve Jehovah. But then what happened? In 1912, brother Russell was on a trip

00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:06.299
through Europe. And he decided to arrange to open a French language office in Geneva, Switzerland.

00:14:07.259 --> 00:14:12.220
And so, when brother Russell looked at the candidates available, he felt that there were other

00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:20.139
brothers who were better educated who should now take over the work. Well, now, how would that affect

00:14:20.139 --> 00:14:26.700
brother Weber? Hear this humble man who had worked so hard to get everything established. Now, being

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:33.820
asked as it were to turn over the reins, well, brother Weber didn't hesitate a bit. The

00:14:34.059 --> 00:14:42.220
yearbook says he gladly stepped down in favor of the more educated brothers. Well, was he discouraged?

00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:48.379
Did he give up? Did he try to compare himself with those other men? No, the yearbook went on to say

00:14:48.379 --> 00:14:54.539
that he kept a good spirit. He continued making his pilgrim visits to the congregations and visiting

00:14:54.539 --> 00:15:01.419
the isolated brothers who spoke French. But what happened? Do you know the end of the story?

00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:09.179
Well, just after a few years, those well-educated brothers who had been placed in charge of the work. Do

00:15:09.179 --> 00:15:17.100
you know what happened to them? They all proved to be unfaithful. And what happened? Well, where's

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:25.340
brother Weber? We have to go and find this dear humble man bringing him back. He has to go and

00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:31.259
strengthen the brothers, encourage them, readjust them, which he gladly did.

00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:38.220
Despite the many challenges that this brother experienced, he continued to strengthen and fortify

00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:46.059
the brothers until he finished his earthly course sometime about the year 1947. What's the lesson

00:15:46.059 --> 00:15:54.620
that we can learn? See, brother Weber demonstrated the truth of Galatians chapter 6 and verse 4. He proved

00:15:54.620 --> 00:16:01.980
what his own work was. He was content to be a lesser one and to use his abilities and his

00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:08.700
spirituality to be a source of encouragement to others. He did not spend all of his time comparing

00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:16.539
himself with others, but he brought what he had and he used it to honor Jehovah. Well, his labor

00:16:16.539 --> 00:16:23.419
was not in vain. Do you know in the area where he opened up the work so long ago, there are well

00:16:23.419 --> 00:16:31.580
over 100,000 publishers who are praising Jehovah's name. What a powerful lesson we can learn

00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:39.820
from this simple, humble brother, Adolf Weber. But now let's talk about our final area where we

00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:48.139
might begin to think that our labor is in vain. Perhaps some of you here have been serving at

00:16:48.139 --> 00:16:56.139
Bethel for decades, many, many years, and now you have been reassigned to the field. Others of you

00:16:56.139 --> 00:17:03.100
may be circuit overseers who have reached the age of 70, and now you've begun to serve as regular

00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:10.539
or as special pioneers. Well, now should any of you in that situation feel that your labors have

00:17:10.539 --> 00:17:21.579
been in vain? Absolutely not. Quite frankly, brothers, if possible, all of us at Bethel should return

00:17:21.579 --> 00:17:29.660
to the field, if it were possible. Because what did Jesus say at Matthew 9 and verse 37? Yes,

00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:39.019
the harvest is great, but the workers are few. Therefore beg the master of the harvest to send out

00:17:39.019 --> 00:17:47.259
workers into his harvest. Yes, the workers are needed out in the field. And these dear brothers

00:17:47.259 --> 00:17:53.900
and sisters who have returned to the field who are now in the pioneer service, they are accomplishing

00:17:53.900 --> 00:18:01.019
tremendous work. Just as the Gilead School now has been designed to train special full-time

00:18:01.019 --> 00:18:07.980
servants to strengthen and stabilize, what now these ones who have returned to the field are

00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:15.019
having a powerful strengthening effect on the congregations. They're sharing their experience,

00:18:15.019 --> 00:18:21.500
their maturity, the many wonderful lessons that they learned from all of those years either in

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:28.059
Bethel service or in traveling work. Now, you know the governing body receives many letters from

00:18:28.059 --> 00:18:33.660
the field, many letters of appreciation, but I'd like to just quote from one that we recently

00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:40.859
received, a sister wrote to the governing body and she said this, I want to thank you for sending

00:18:40.859 --> 00:18:47.740
into the field those who have served in special full-time service. Well, I cannot imagine how hard

00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:55.980
the decision must have been. I know I have benefited beyond words from having such dear ones in my

00:18:55.980 --> 00:19:04.539
congregation. They are truly a treasure from Jehovah, what a blessing to all those that have such

00:19:04.539 --> 00:19:13.099
ones in their congregation. I thank you so much. Well, now that's just one letter, but those words

00:19:13.099 --> 00:19:19.259
have been echoed by publishers in this country and all around the world who have received these

00:19:19.259 --> 00:19:25.660
well, a qualified individuals coming to their congregation. So, dear brothers and sisters,

00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:31.819
we'd like to say to all of those of you who have been reassigned, how much we love you,

00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:40.539
how much we respect you, how much we appreciate your work, your labor is not in vain.

00:20:00.119 --> 00:20:05.960
Well, it truly is thrilling to be a part of Jehovah's organization at this time. From those small

00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:14.039
beginnings back in 1922 to today, it's amazing to see what has been accomplished. Now, more than

00:20:14.039 --> 00:20:22.680
eight million publishers of the good news, our magnificent, our wonderful God, Jehovah, has chosen

00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:30.920
to accomplish this tremendous preaching work using ordinary imperfect people. And we have been given

00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:38.359
the tremendous privilege to be His fellow workers. Brothers, are you determined to continue to

00:20:38.359 --> 00:21:09.609
preach along with us until we say that this work is finally completed? Then may all of us have

00:21:09.609 --> 00:21:17.690
plenty to do in the work of the Lord with full confidence that our labor will never be in vain.

00:21:29.369 --> 00:21:35.210
We certainly want to thank Mark for that fine talk, and it's encouraging to know that our

00:21:35.210 --> 00:21:43.930
labor will never be in vain. So, Jehovah remembers us for the efforts that we put forth in our service,

00:21:44.730 --> 00:21:53.849
and he remembers us for good. Next, we have Brother Garrett Loosh with a rousing subject force.

00:21:54.650 --> 00:22:04.250
The theme is be a conqueror. The English word conqueror refers to one that conquers.

00:22:05.049 --> 00:22:14.170
To conquer means to defeat someone or something. The Spanish explorers and warriors who successfully

00:22:14.170 --> 00:22:22.809
conquered much of America in the 16th century are called conquistadores or conquerors. One of them

00:22:22.809 --> 00:22:32.730
was Hernán Cortés who conquered the Aztec Empire. At the peak, the Spanish Empire ruled over 19.4

00:22:32.730 --> 00:22:45.369
million square kilometers or 7.5 million square miles. But who conquered more land than the

00:22:45.369 --> 00:22:54.250
Spanish, the Mongols, and the British? At its greatest extent, the British Empire was known as

00:22:54.250 --> 00:23:03.849
the largest empire in history as it covered more than 13 million square miles or 33.7 million

00:23:03.849 --> 00:23:12.730
square kilometers, which is approximately a quarter of the Earth's total land area. Despite its

00:23:12.730 --> 00:23:19.369
overseas holdings, it was barely bigger than the Mongol Empire under Kublai Khan.

00:23:20.490 --> 00:23:28.970
The British Empire was bigger only because of its overseas land holdings. The Mongols were a

00:23:28.970 --> 00:23:34.250
nomadic people who originated from the grassland plateau of what is today Mongolia

00:23:34.890 --> 00:23:43.130
in Central and Northeast Asia. Their speedy conquest beginning in the early 13th century of our

00:23:43.130 --> 00:23:51.529
common era changed the face of Asia in half of Europe. In just 25 years, the Mongols subjugated

00:23:51.529 --> 00:23:59.130
the inhabitants of more territories than the Romans had conquered in four centuries.

00:23:59.609 --> 00:24:08.250
At the peak of their power, they ruled from Vietnam to Hungary a distance of about 5,500 miles

00:24:08.250 --> 00:24:20.569
or 8,700 kilometers. And from Siberia to India, the largest contiguous land empire in recorded

00:24:20.650 --> 00:24:29.900
history, including modern times. Then there was Hitler who saw himself as a world conqueror.

00:24:30.619 --> 00:24:37.819
He promoted the slogan, today, Germany belongs to us, tomorrow, the whole world.

00:24:39.099 --> 00:24:49.200
His attempt to conquer the world failed miserably. How about the conquest in Biber times?

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:55.759
After the exodus of the Israelites from Egypt in 513 before our common era,

00:24:55.759 --> 00:25:02.559
Jehovah told the Israelites to conquer the land of Canaan. They were afraid and disobeyed

00:25:03.359 --> 00:25:07.200
besides Moses, only Joshua and Caleb were willing to fight.

00:25:08.319 --> 00:25:14.720
Number 1330 says, then Caleb tried to calm the people as they stood before Moses by saying,

00:25:14.799 --> 00:25:21.680
let us go up immediately and we are sure to take possession of it because we can surely conquer it.

00:25:24.029 --> 00:25:29.309
For the lack of faith, the Israelites had to wander for 40 years in the wilderness,

00:25:29.309 --> 00:25:34.029
after that they conquered Canaan during a period of about five years.

00:25:35.789 --> 00:25:41.549
In King Jehosophad's day, Jehovah caused a victory over the Ammonites, Moabites and

00:25:41.549 --> 00:25:49.309
Edomites from Seir and Alliance of Nations. Israel did not conquer in their own strength,

00:25:49.309 --> 00:25:56.430
but Jehovah gave them the victory by confusing the enemy alliance so they killed each other,

00:25:56.430 --> 00:26:06.000
according to 2 Chronicles chapter 21 through 4. What about the conquest in the time of the end?

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:12.240
Do you know a world conqueror that conquered a larger area than the Mongols and the British

00:26:13.359 --> 00:26:22.319
empires? Well, Revelation 6 verse 2 gives the answer. We can read about that conqueror.

00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:32.559
And I saw and looked a white horse and the one seated on it had a bow and a crown was given him,

00:26:32.559 --> 00:26:40.400
well we know that, refers to Jesus, and he went out conquering and to complete his conquest.

00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:52.319
Well, Jesus now rules over the whole earth. When did he go out to conquer in 1914 of our

00:26:52.319 --> 00:27:00.240
common era, and when will he complete his conquest at Armageddon? Who did Jesus already conquer?

00:27:01.599 --> 00:27:07.680
First he conquered Satan and the demons throwing them out of heaven and restricting their movements

00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:13.759
to the earth and its vicinity. This war is described in Revelation chapter 12.

00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:24.960
But in 1914 his conquest was not complete yet. At Armageddon it will be. Satan will be thrown into

00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:32.960
an abyss of inactivity and at the end of the 4,000 years he will be totally destroyed.

00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:41.759
What a conquest that will be. At Armageddon also all human governments will likewise be conquered.

00:27:43.759 --> 00:27:51.279
Let's read Revelation chapter 17 verse 4. We'll find this prophecy.

00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:09.599
It says to the one, these will battle with the lamb, but because he is Lord of lords and king of kings,

00:28:09.599 --> 00:28:16.720
the lamb will conquer them. Also those with him who are called and chosen and faithful,

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:28.279
anointed Christians will do so. How about spiritual conquests? In Revelation chapter 2 and 3,

00:28:28.279 --> 00:28:39.000
seven times Jesus says with reference to the one who conquers. One example is Revelation 321.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:46.920
It says to the one who conquers I will grant to sit down with me on my throne, just as I conquered

00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:55.720
and sat down with my father on his throne. How do the anointed conquer even right now before Armageddon?

00:28:56.680 --> 00:29:03.000
They conquer by remaining loyal to Jehovah. They conquer due to their faith, due to their love for

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:09.960
Jehovah and Jesus. They also conquer the evil with the good in everyday life.

00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:18.839
What about the great crowd mentioned in Revelation chapter 7? Talking about the situation

00:29:18.839 --> 00:29:28.200
on earth under the misionic kingdom, Revelation 21 7 says, to anyone thirsting, I will give from

00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:37.480
the spring of water of life free. Anyone conquering will inherit these things, and I will be his God

00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:46.960
and he will be my son. The Revelation climax book, therefore, says on page 304,

00:29:47.920 --> 00:30:00.299
the great crowd too must conquer. Even children can be conquerors. When a child is

00:30:00.299 --> 00:30:07.579
shoved by a sibling, usually the child's first reaction is to shove back. Sadly, such behavior is

00:30:07.579 --> 00:30:14.940
not limited to children. Many adults act similarly. When offended by someone, they want to get even

00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:23.500
granted. Most adults will not give a literal shove, but many will push back in more subtle ways.

00:30:24.299 --> 00:30:31.819
Whatever method is used, the intent is the same, to retaliate. Although the urge to get even

00:30:31.819 --> 00:30:39.420
as deep seated, true Christians resist giving in to that urge. Instead, they strive to follow the

00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:52.059
Apostle Paul's admonition of Romans 12-17, return evil for evil to no one. Paul explains in detail

00:30:52.059 --> 00:31:03.180
how all of us can conquer in everyday life. He wrote in Romans 12-20-21, if your enemy is hungry,

00:31:03.819 --> 00:31:09.420
feed him, if he's thirsty, give him something to drink. For by doing this, you will heap fiery

00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:18.140
coals upon his head. Do not let yourself be conquered by the evil, but keep conquering the evil

00:31:18.140 --> 00:31:27.740
with the good back to your children. How can you conquer the evil with the good if a sibling or

00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:37.660
a classmate says something or does something unkind? You conquer by not retaliating. A worldly

00:31:37.660 --> 00:31:44.859
nursery rhyme puts it this way, tit for that, you kill my dog, I kill you cat, maybe some of you

00:31:44.859 --> 00:31:56.200
know that. But Jesus tells us to forgive. Do something good, pray for the other child.

00:31:58.039 --> 00:32:02.440
Because another has made a mistake, is no reason for us to make one also, is it?

00:32:03.079 --> 00:32:12.119
Jehovah does not want us to retaliate. In 1 Thessalonians 5-15, it says, see that no one renders

00:32:12.119 --> 00:32:20.200
injury for injury to anyone else, but always pursue what is good toward one another and to all others.

00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:27.039
Therefore, children, are you willing to conquer the evil with the good?

00:32:27.759 --> 00:32:37.839
We want to commend you for your effort to do that. You are making Jehovah's heart glad this way.

00:32:37.839 --> 00:32:49.789
How can we all conquer spiritually? We do so by not retaliating. This is the way of love. Many came

00:32:49.789 --> 00:32:56.509
into the truth because of a Christian mate doing good to an unbelieving mate for decades, although

00:32:56.589 --> 00:33:02.990
having been treated terribly. In the domestic setting, a wife who shows genuine kindness,

00:33:02.990 --> 00:33:07.950
there has been, after he makes unpleasant comments about her beliefs or yells at her,

00:33:08.829 --> 00:33:17.150
may well diffuse a potentially explosive situation, such sisters conquer evil with good.

00:33:18.109 --> 00:33:26.509
We want to commend all of you who are not giving up on your unbelieving marriage mate.

00:33:29.839 --> 00:33:34.720
If you show understanding and compassion to the person who is treating you badly,

00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:41.279
you might make him or her want to learn more about the Bible, more about Jehovah. No matter what

00:33:41.279 --> 00:33:49.839
she responds, you are mild and kind. Actions and words make the person wonder why you are different.

00:33:50.960 --> 00:34:05.920
1 Peter 3, 4 refers to the quote, incorruptible adornment of the quiet and mild spirit, quiet and mild

00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:14.269
spirit. On one island, the Pentecostal woman started to study the Bible, but her

00:34:15.150 --> 00:34:21.070
opposed her husband did, of course, not like it. He even threatened the elders.

00:34:22.190 --> 00:34:26.829
But then he fell sick. It was taken to a hospital where he fell into a coma.

00:34:28.030 --> 00:34:33.630
When he eventually regained consciousness, two sisters visited and brought him some soup,

00:34:34.349 --> 00:34:40.429
which he first thought was for his wife. No, the soup is for you, said the sisters.

00:34:41.869 --> 00:34:48.989
That touched me deeply, he recalls. No Pentecostal had visited me, yet two of Jehovah's

00:34:48.989 --> 00:34:57.869
witnesses. The very people I had strongly opposed brought me a meal. He recovered from his illness.

00:34:57.869 --> 00:35:07.179
He studied twice a week and was baptized in 1998. Do you want to hear another soup experience?

00:35:09.949 --> 00:35:15.150
Two brothers in Russia were preaching from house to house one morning. A woman listened to their

00:35:15.150 --> 00:35:21.550
introduction and then excused herself. She returned with a pot of boiled red beet soup.

00:35:22.349 --> 00:35:28.349
And through this on the brothers, adding angrily, do not visit me again.

00:35:30.110 --> 00:35:34.510
The brothers returned home to change their clothes and then continued their activity.

00:35:35.230 --> 00:35:38.429
Later that day, they went to the market to order

00:35:41.070 --> 00:35:47.710
ingredients needed for a good portion. That evening, they visited the same woman again.

00:35:48.590 --> 00:35:54.750
They told her that this time they came not to preach, but to compensate her for the loss of the

00:35:54.750 --> 00:36:01.309
her family's food, knowing that the soup she had wasted might have been the entire family meal.

00:36:03.150 --> 00:36:08.829
Then they handed her the food stuff that they had purchased. The woman was so surprised that

00:36:08.829 --> 00:36:15.710
she invited the brothers in to talk. In time, a Bible study was started with this woman.

00:36:18.489 --> 00:36:25.130
When non-witnesses treat us badly, it is to be expected. But when problems occur with a spiritual

00:36:25.130 --> 00:36:31.210
brother or sister, the pain can be much deeper. One brother recalled,

00:36:31.210 --> 00:36:35.849
my biggest hurdle when coming into the truth was accepting the fact that Jehovah's people are

00:36:36.650 --> 00:36:42.889
not perfect. Thus, if a fellow Christian, especially one with privileges in the congregation,

00:36:42.889 --> 00:36:49.769
is thoughtless in and acts in an un-Christian way, it can hurt us. How can such things occur

00:36:49.769 --> 00:36:56.730
among Jehovah's people, some may ask? Actually, such things did occur even among anointed Christians in

00:36:56.730 --> 00:37:05.929
the days of the Apostles. How should we respond when we are affected? We can forgive and we can

00:37:05.929 --> 00:37:14.730
pray for them. This way, we prove ourselves to be conquerors. We call the experience of Joseph.

00:37:15.530 --> 00:37:21.130
His brothers dealt cruelly with him, but he conquered the bad they did to him with good,

00:37:21.130 --> 00:37:30.329
resulting in happiness for all and certainly also for Jehovah. Brothers in Nazi times and in

00:37:30.329 --> 00:37:37.929
concentration camps did not retaliate when mistreated by SS officers. Because of that, some of the

00:37:37.929 --> 00:37:46.409
SS officers came into the truth. Some officers in camps preferred to be shaved by the brothers,

00:37:46.409 --> 00:37:51.769
only the brothers. As they were nervous, if other prisoners would do it,

00:37:52.570 --> 00:37:58.250
fearing that one would perhaps retaliate and cut the throat in the revenge.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:08.519
Twelve sisters were in the camp of Birkenau only a few days, then they were taken to another camp

00:38:08.519 --> 00:38:16.280
Auschwitz to work in the homes of SS officers. They wanted only Jehovah's witnesses for that,

00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:22.679
these officers. They were afraid of having others working in their households. They trusted that

00:38:22.679 --> 00:38:32.199
the sisters would not try to poison them. In the 1960s, I met Franz Desch from Yenbach, Austria.

00:38:32.199 --> 00:38:38.440
He was taken to the Gusion concentration camp. There, he was able to study the Bible with an

00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:47.000
SS officer. How much progress was made? Well, imagine the great joy of both of them, when some

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:58.760
years later, they met as brothers at the convention. Now let's talk about conquering opposition today.

00:39:00.039 --> 00:39:06.119
The pressures of life in this wicked system can make people feel angry, although we are kind,

00:39:06.119 --> 00:39:11.480
peaceful and law abiding. Jehovah's enemies launched vicious attacks against us,

00:39:12.039 --> 00:39:18.519
like some people in lands such as Russia, some slanderers in the press or even in courts.

00:39:19.239 --> 00:39:26.519
Some governments have banned the God's people, and Jesus said that his followers are to expect that.

00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:33.880
In the future, as the great tribulation gets closer, we may have to face even more opposition.

00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:44.199
How should we react? Romans 12, 17, never return evil for evil in word or deed.

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:51.239
Regardless of what the devil and his agents bring upon us, by conquering the evil with the good,

00:39:51.239 --> 00:39:59.880
we can give a fine witness. An important key is using gracious speech, Proverbs 25-15.

00:40:00.679 --> 00:40:10.639
A mild tongue itself can break a bone. Jesus is the best example of not retaliating when the

00:40:10.639 --> 00:40:17.199
Apostle Peter cut off the ear of Malkus in the Garden of Gethsemane. Jesus reproved him and healed

00:40:17.199 --> 00:40:24.719
Malkus. He did good to Malkus, although he was a member of that mob that had come to arrest Jesus.

00:40:26.719 --> 00:40:37.360
Well, Jesus was perfect. We are not, but we need to conquer also ourselves. We need to conquer

00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:44.880
wrong attitudes or bad habits that we might have. To conquer also means, according to

00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:52.880
a dictionary, to gain control of a problem or difficulty through great effort. Many of us,

00:40:52.880 --> 00:41:00.559
when we came into the truth, have conquered the smoking habit, overuse of alcohol or drug addiction

00:41:00.639 --> 00:41:09.679
with great effort. Then there's the bad habit of viewing pornography. According to one estimate,

00:41:09.679 --> 00:41:23.039
the number of pornographic emails that are sent daily amount to 2.5 billion or 1.7 million per minute.

00:41:23.039 --> 00:41:35.760
Great effort is needed to conquer the addiction of viewing pornography. After baptism,

00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:43.760
there may be more things to conquer like over-eating, violent temper, the inclination to gossip,

00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:54.219
perhaps truthfully, but negatively about others. It also includes conquering an exaggerated fear of

00:41:54.300 --> 00:42:01.980
men. Faith in Jehovah will help you to conquer such fears. Governments may try to restrict freedom

00:42:01.980 --> 00:42:10.139
to worship God, and we may even feel not sure about our own lives. But remember, the antidote to fear of

00:42:10.139 --> 00:42:20.380
man is faith in Jehovah. 1 John 5, 5 asks, who can conquer the world? Is it not the one who has

00:42:20.380 --> 00:42:30.539
faith that Jesus is the Son of God? The previous verse verse 4 says, and this is the conquest that

00:42:30.539 --> 00:42:40.059
has conquered the world, our faith. In view of the matchless power, Jehovah could force us to conquer

00:42:40.059 --> 00:42:48.940
every weakness without having to struggle or to learn from our mistakes. But why does he not do so?

00:42:49.739 --> 00:42:56.860
Jehovah has given us the precious gift of free will. By choosing to do God's will and by working

00:42:56.860 --> 00:43:03.019
hard to do so, we show the depth of our love for Jehovah and our desire to please him.

00:43:05.820 --> 00:43:13.739
We are conquerors even now. Jesus did not say he will conquer at the end of the system of things.

00:43:13.739 --> 00:43:20.860
He said that he already had conquered when he was on earth. John 1633 says,

00:43:20.860 --> 00:43:27.820
in the world you will have tribulation, but take courage. I have conquered the world.

00:43:30.199 --> 00:43:38.679
In the verse before, Jesus said, the father is with me, John 1632. So, yes, Jehovah helped him to

00:43:38.679 --> 00:43:45.639
conquer. Jesus did not have to fight alone and neither do we have to fight alone. Jehovah and

00:43:45.639 --> 00:43:53.159
Jesus are on our side to support us. Paul said, Jehovah is my helper. I will not be afraid.

00:43:53.159 --> 00:44:03.480
What can man do to me? Hebrews 136. Be determined to keep conquering the world.

00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:11.079
Winning one fight is not enough. We have to keep fighting. To conquer is a continuous action.

00:44:11.079 --> 00:44:19.559
We need endurance. Second Corinthians 4.16 Paul said, we do not give up.

00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:28.039
The Spanish, the Mongols and the British did not conquer their territories in a day or week

00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:39.159
or a month. Similarly, Romans 12-21 says, do not let yourself be conquered, but keep conquering the

00:44:39.159 --> 00:44:49.179
evil with the good. Continuous action. Here's a true of us. Since we're much weaker than Jesus

00:44:49.179 --> 00:44:55.179
and since we're imperfect, we can conquer the evil. We can conquer the world, but we cannot

00:44:55.260 --> 00:45:07.099
conquer Satan. First John 2.14 says, I write you, young men, because you are strong,

00:45:07.099 --> 00:45:14.780
and the word of God remains in you and listen. You have conquered the wicked one.

00:45:15.820 --> 00:45:22.780
Yes, they have conquered Satan back in the first century. We can do the same today. We will not

00:45:22.860 --> 00:45:29.739
be able to conquer Satan out of his existence. Soon, though, Jehovah will use Jesus and

00:45:29.739 --> 00:45:35.340
the anointed to throw Satan and the demons into an abyss of inactivity, and at the end of the

00:45:35.340 --> 00:45:45.980
millennium they will crush Satan's head completely, according to Romans 16-20. Satan and the demons

00:45:45.980 --> 00:45:58.239
are not conquerors of God's people. They are losers. Jehovah will also direct Christ Jesus to

00:45:58.239 --> 00:46:08.730
crush and put an end to all human political systems. They also will end up being losers. Now,

00:46:09.530 --> 00:46:22.010
read Romans chapter 8, 37 to 39, and this assures all faithful ones. It says,

00:46:26.119 --> 00:46:33.000
in all these things, we are coming off completely victorious through the one who loved us,

00:46:33.639 --> 00:46:39.239
for I'm convinced that neither death nor life, no angels, no governments, no things now,

00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:46.119
things to come, no powers, no height, no depths. Now, any other creation will be able to separate us

00:46:46.119 --> 00:46:58.119
from God's love that is in Christ Jesus, our Lord. In review, be assured that we can spiritually

00:46:58.119 --> 00:47:06.039
conquer the world by remaining loyal to Jehovah, to Jesus and the kingdom. We can spiritually conquer

00:47:06.039 --> 00:47:15.480
evil by our faith, by our love, and by doing good. Second, we can also spiritually conquer

00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:23.239
our own bad habits or wrong attitudes. Third, we can spiritually conquer Satan the devil,

00:47:24.119 --> 00:47:33.960
and we can do it even now. Fourth, finally, Jesus and the anointed will completely conquer Satan,

00:47:33.960 --> 00:47:42.599
the demons, and all human governments in opposition to Jehovah at Armageddon, the climax of the

00:47:42.599 --> 00:47:52.440
coming Great Tribulation. What strong encouragement we have to continue to be conquerors.

00:48:00.940 --> 00:48:08.380
Thank you very much, Brother Loach. We needed those words of encouragement to be world conquerors.

00:48:08.380 --> 00:48:16.219
We appreciate your help. Now, pay close attention to Brother Jeffrey Jackson.

00:48:17.420 --> 00:48:26.219
As expected, he has an intriguing title for us. Expect the unexpected.

00:48:31.659 --> 00:48:38.699
I'm sure every one of us here today would agree that this year's regional convention program was

00:48:38.699 --> 00:48:59.840
absolutely fantastic. And probably one of the most common comments that have been made is that

00:48:59.840 --> 00:49:07.039
many brothers and sisters have said, this convention has truly prepared us for the Great Tribulation.

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:14.800
And we certainly feel that way. But as our minds think about the Great Tribulation and the

00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:21.679
importance of Jesus' words, it's true at times that our imagination perhaps becomes very active.

00:49:22.239 --> 00:49:30.719
We have maybe have questions. How long will be the Great Tribulation? How will it affect me personally?

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:42.860
Would I be able to get my medication? What about my cat? Well, the short answer to all those

00:49:42.860 --> 00:49:54.460
intriguing questions is we don't know. But there is something that we do know beyond any doubt whatsoever.

00:49:54.460 --> 00:50:03.980
Let's turn to the book of 2nd Peter, chapter 2 and verse 9. And this fact fills us with confidence

00:50:03.980 --> 00:50:12.219
as we look to the future to the outbreak of the Great Tribulation. So 2nd Peter, chapter 2 and verse 9.

00:50:13.659 --> 00:50:22.300
There it tells us. So then Jehovah knows how to rescue people of Godly devotion out of trial.

00:50:23.420 --> 00:50:31.260
Yes, brothers and sisters, we know Jehovah. We know his record. We have studied the scriptures.

00:50:32.219 --> 00:50:38.380
And we totally believe that no matter what happens, even though we don't know the details of what

00:50:38.380 --> 00:50:46.380
the future holds, we believe that Jehovah knows how to rescue righteous persons. And we've seen

00:50:46.380 --> 00:50:54.940
time and time again how Jehovah does the unexpected. When we look through the scriptures,

00:50:54.940 --> 00:51:03.579
that point is emphasized over and over again. There are two scriptures that help to fortify

00:51:03.659 --> 00:51:09.420
this faith and belief that we have. Let's look at them together. The first one is found in the book

00:51:09.420 --> 00:51:21.980
of Ephesians. Ephesians chapter 3 and verse 20. Ephesians 3 verse 20. Hear the apostle Paul under

00:51:21.980 --> 00:51:28.940
inspiration tells us, now to the one who can, according to his power that is operating in us,

00:51:29.739 --> 00:51:40.300
do more than super abundantly beyond all the things we ask or conceive. Now this is a fantastic

00:51:40.300 --> 00:51:46.300
expression in the writing department. If we were to write this, I'm sure the proofreaders would

00:51:46.300 --> 00:51:56.000
correct it, but this is under inspiration. First start, let's think of the word super abundantly.

00:51:56.079 --> 00:52:04.800
Now the proofreaders may tell us for a start, abundant is enough, but here we have super abundantly.

00:52:05.920 --> 00:52:14.239
Now it doesn't stop there, does it? Because Paul then says under inspiration, more than super abundantly.

00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:23.679
And it gets even better beyond all the things we ask or conceive. This is certainly making the

00:52:23.679 --> 00:52:32.480
point, isn't it? And what is the point? That Jehovah can do things beyond what we would expect.

00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:41.760
It's so interesting for us to note that Jehovah does not limit himself to what we ask for in our

00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:49.599
prayers. And we can be happy of that because he goes beyond anything that we could ever think of

00:52:49.599 --> 00:52:57.280
to solve our problems. So it's true at times we may see no way out of our problems. We may feel

00:52:57.280 --> 00:53:04.880
overwhelmed, but remember what does it say here? Jehovah has the power to do more than super abundantly

00:53:04.880 --> 00:53:12.320
beyond all the things we ask or conceive. Now the second scripture is in the book of Philippians,

00:53:13.119 --> 00:53:22.570
chapter 4 and verse 6. Here again, we're told, do not be anxious over anything,

00:53:23.369 --> 00:53:29.849
but in everything by prayer and supplication, along with thanksgiving, let your petitions be made

00:53:29.849 --> 00:53:38.250
known to God, and the peace of God that now notice again, surpasses all understanding.

00:53:39.050 --> 00:53:46.570
Will guard your hearts and your mental powers by means of Christ Jesus? Have you noticed

00:53:46.570 --> 00:53:52.650
in several of the talks today, the point has been made over and over again that this

00:53:52.650 --> 00:53:59.050
pressure of possession that we have is our relationship with Jehovah. We need to trust him.

00:53:59.050 --> 00:54:04.409
Now when the peace of God comes to us because of praying to Jehovah and trusting him,

00:54:04.409 --> 00:54:13.289
what does it say here? Then that surpasses all understanding. Other translations put it this way,

00:54:13.289 --> 00:54:22.090
surpasses all our dreams, excels all human planning is more wonderful than we can imagine.

00:54:23.449 --> 00:54:28.969
Truly brothers and sisters, we don't need to know all the details of what the future holds.

00:54:29.769 --> 00:54:35.210
We know that our loving God Jehovah will do things in a wonderful way.

00:54:36.250 --> 00:54:45.289
Yes, he does the unexpected and he does it with style. That's the amazing thing.

00:54:46.650 --> 00:54:51.530
As we read through the scriptures, we see this over and over again. Let's think about

00:54:52.170 --> 00:55:00.489
Haman back in the days of Esther and Mordecai. Haman had a lot of money, a lot of influence,

00:55:00.489 --> 00:55:08.489
and a plan he wanted to commit genocide to destroy all of God's people, and it looked like the

00:55:08.489 --> 00:55:18.329
plan was going to succeed. But Haman didn't know what Jehovah had in mind. Esther, Mordecai were in

00:55:18.409 --> 00:55:24.969
place and how things turned out. The very day that the Jews should have been slaughtered and

00:55:24.969 --> 00:55:33.690
completely eradicated was the day that their enemies were killed instead. But as we read through those

00:55:33.690 --> 00:55:41.929
events, Jehovah did so many unexpected things. Personally, I just love chapter 6. Right in the middle

00:55:42.010 --> 00:55:48.889
of this intrigue where we see what Jehovah is preparing, then there's an account about the king

00:55:48.889 --> 00:55:55.369
not being able to sleep. Isn't it wonderful? You see, Haman comes in at the wrong time for Haman.

00:55:57.719 --> 00:56:05.800
He assumes wrongly that the king is going to bless him. And what's the result? He has to be

00:56:05.800 --> 00:56:14.300
humiliated, walking around in front of Mordecai on a horse, wearing the king's clothes. That's

00:56:14.300 --> 00:56:24.670
style. Jehovah didn't have to do that, but when we look back on it, that really is style, isn't it?

00:56:25.949 --> 00:56:32.989
And we can be sure that Jehovah will continue to do these things for his people. Recently, of course,

00:56:32.989 --> 00:56:39.469
we just watched that beautiful presentation with regard to Hezekiah. Didn't that full length

00:56:39.469 --> 00:56:46.269
movie help us to imagine exactly what happened at that time? But in the case of Hezekiah,

00:56:46.269 --> 00:56:54.429
what did he do in the time leading up to that event? Well, he fortified the city, he stopped

00:56:54.429 --> 00:57:00.110
up the well so the Assyrians wouldn't be able to get water. He did all sorts of things to plan.

00:57:01.150 --> 00:57:08.190
And yet, none of that was needed. Why? He didn't realize what Jehovah is going to do. The

00:57:08.190 --> 00:57:14.110
unexpected. We didn't even expect it when we saw that angel in the movie. Did we?

00:57:15.869 --> 00:57:23.230
What a wonderful presentation it was. But you see, Jehovah again did the unexpected. None of his

00:57:23.230 --> 00:57:29.550
people were thinking that Jehovah would do that. And yet, he had the situation under control.

00:57:30.429 --> 00:57:35.550
And of course, time and time again as we look through the scriptures, we see this emphasized

00:57:36.190 --> 00:57:40.909
Moses and Israelites, if we were standing with them there on the shores of the Dead Sea,

00:57:40.909 --> 00:57:47.230
where the Egyptians coming behind us, who of us would have ever guessed that Jehovah is now

00:57:47.230 --> 00:57:54.030
going to part the Red Sea? I mean, that was unexpected. It was also unexpected that the Egyptians

00:57:54.030 --> 00:58:02.429
would be so stupid to follow the Israelites. And yet it resulted in a wonderful victory for Jehovah's

00:58:02.429 --> 00:58:08.829
people. You see, expect the unexpected when it comes to what Jehovah does.

00:58:10.190 --> 00:58:15.309
Now, thinking back to what the Apostle Paul was inspired to say to the brothers in Philippi,

00:58:16.030 --> 00:58:20.989
let's think about the setting of when he wrote that and a little bit of the background.

00:58:21.949 --> 00:58:30.190
The Apostle Paul said, basically, don't worry, pray, because Jehovah can do the unexpected.

00:58:30.670 --> 00:58:38.269
Well, was Paul perhaps writing that particular time as an academic sitting behind a desk,

00:58:39.150 --> 00:58:46.110
someone who is testing out something he doesn't really know about? Of course not. We remember back

00:58:46.110 --> 00:58:53.550
at that time in 60 to 61 CE, the Apostle Paul was imprisoned and wrong. He'd already experienced

00:58:53.550 --> 00:58:59.789
many, many different hardships. He, you, what it was like to be in the time of trial.

00:59:00.750 --> 00:59:05.230
But even the very fact that he was writing to the brothers in Philippi is of interest.

00:59:05.949 --> 00:59:10.989
Let's just refresh our memories about this. You'll see the record in Acts 16.

00:59:12.349 --> 00:59:19.389
But what actually happened 10 years before Paul wrote the letter to the brothers in Philippi?

00:59:20.349 --> 00:59:27.230
Well, Paul was in Asia Minor. He was going, trying to find somewhere where the Holy Spirit would

00:59:27.230 --> 00:59:34.670
allow him to preach. So he went to one location, no. Went to another location, no. Eventually,

00:59:34.670 --> 00:59:43.389
arrives at Troas. And there, one evening, he sees a Macedonian man. And what does he say,

00:59:44.349 --> 00:59:51.630
step over to Macedonia? Well, Paul naturally assumed this was Johova's direction.

00:59:52.190 --> 00:59:58.429
And immediately, he made plans to step over to Macedonia. And this actually started the

00:59:58.429 --> 01:00:06.590
preaching work in Europe. Well, he arrived first at the seaport of Neapolis and then made his way

01:00:06.590 --> 01:00:13.869
to Philippi. Well, immediately there was some success. Some started to accept the message.

01:00:14.829 --> 01:00:22.269
But what happened shortly thereafter? Well, as we already mentioned today, the account tells us that

01:00:22.269 --> 01:00:29.469
Paul and Silas were beaten up and thrown into a dungeon, into a prison. Now, if you were Paul

01:00:30.269 --> 01:00:37.309
and you were sitting there in prison with your back painting, singing songs to bring yourself comfort,

01:00:37.309 --> 01:00:46.190
perhaps would you think this, what is Johova doing? I mean, I was in Asia Minor. I could have

01:00:46.190 --> 01:00:53.230
preached anywhere in Asia Minor, but no. The vision sets step over into Macedonia. Now, I'm

01:00:53.230 --> 01:01:01.070
assuming there's a big door of activity open, but now here I am in prison. Why did Johova

01:01:01.070 --> 01:01:06.989
direct me to come here? I'm sure I think most of us would probably start thinking along that line

01:01:06.989 --> 01:01:12.989
and perhaps we discouraged. Perhaps at times you've felt you followed Johova's direction and then

01:01:12.989 --> 01:01:20.429
you've had problems. So we used to understanding that situation. But what happened that very night?

01:01:20.750 --> 01:01:28.510
An earthquake. The doors of the prison open up. The jailer and his family accept the truth. And then

01:01:28.510 --> 01:01:35.550
this is where it proves that Johova has style. Those magistrates apologize. The Paul Paul says,

01:01:35.550 --> 01:01:47.260
no, you take us out and you escort us out of the city. Now, that's style. And as we read,

01:01:47.260 --> 01:01:54.380
what do we notice? I imagine this in my mind, it says Paul said goodbye to Lydia. And I imagine,

01:01:54.380 --> 01:01:59.659
maybe I'm wrong, but I'm imagining the magistrates standing outside Lydia's home waiting for Paul to

01:01:59.659 --> 01:02:06.619
say goodbye and then continuing to escort them out of the city. Now, not only is that style,

01:02:06.619 --> 01:02:13.099
but it was practical because it appears that perhaps Luke, the doctor, was left to stay there

01:02:13.099 --> 01:02:18.860
in Philippi and established the congregation. And no doubt those magistrates would have thought

01:02:18.860 --> 01:02:26.860
twice before they did anything bad to the Christians after that. But what's the point? At times,

01:02:26.860 --> 01:02:33.980
we may feel that there's no way out of our problems. But surely the lesson that we learn over and

01:02:33.980 --> 01:02:41.179
over and over again is that Johova can turn things completely around. Yes, even though we may

01:02:41.179 --> 01:02:47.980
speculate and think, what if maybe he'll do this? In the end, when we look back on events,

01:02:47.980 --> 01:02:55.659
we can't help but be impressed with how Johova handles things. He has everything and under control.

01:02:56.460 --> 01:03:02.699
So that brings us back to the regional convention, the Sunday program. We all enjoyed that's

01:03:02.699 --> 01:03:09.500
imposing of talks with the little videos dealing with the great tribulation. Maybe for most of us,

01:03:09.500 --> 01:03:15.500
it took us a while to work out what were they doing in the basement. Usually, by the time there was a

01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:21.980
knock, then we started to realize that it was at the time of the great tribulation. And with

01:03:21.980 --> 01:03:29.019
excitement, we watched as that door opened and there the police, the military were facing our brothers

01:03:29.019 --> 01:03:37.500
and sisters. And you were waiting, will the angel come and take them out? Will fire come from heaven?

01:03:37.500 --> 01:03:48.219
And we were left hanging. Why? The simple answer? We don't know. But one thing is for sure,

01:03:48.219 --> 01:03:58.059
if Johova is on our side, we do not need to fear men. Yes, it's true. We don't know all the details

01:03:58.059 --> 01:04:04.059
of the great tribulation. We don't know exactly what's going to happen in the future. But we do know

01:04:04.139 --> 01:04:10.139
that our loving Heavenly Father, Johova God, has everything under control. Yes, he has

01:04:10.139 --> 01:04:44.010
styled, so we can expect the unexpected. I used to give talks like that when I was young.

01:05:02.570 --> 01:05:10.559
We have another blessing. It has to be presented by the tongue of brother Anthony Morse.

01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:19.679
Listen carefully as he develops the theme, run to Johova. I had to say I remember those talks.

01:05:21.679 --> 01:05:38.110
I miss them so much, Sam. Expect the unexpected. Thank you very much.

01:05:43.929 --> 01:05:45.690
Now I have to get very serious.

01:05:55.130 --> 01:06:03.130
Johova and his holy word forewarned us to expect ridicule for our conviction that he's going to

01:06:03.130 --> 01:06:10.489
destroy Satan's wicked system of things. Quoting scripture, where is this promised presence of his

01:06:10.570 --> 01:06:16.730
all things are continuing exactly as they were from creations beginning? In other words,

01:06:16.730 --> 01:06:22.809
everything's the same. Nothing's really changed. Our things really the same.

01:06:24.170 --> 01:06:27.929
Well, here in the United States, among the many shootings, I'm thinking of the one

01:06:28.650 --> 01:06:35.369
not too long ago down in Dallas, Texas, and this man was shooting at police officers and they caught

01:06:35.369 --> 01:06:41.050
video of it, and people didn't know what the shooting was about or who was particular target,

01:06:41.050 --> 01:06:48.570
so they started to run. They didn't know where they were running, but they were just looking for safety.

01:06:49.769 --> 01:06:56.489
So running, looking for safety, panic was in their faces. You could see it on the video.

01:06:57.849 --> 01:07:04.170
Now, during these final days of Satan's rule all over the world, people are frightened.

01:07:05.130 --> 01:07:11.530
They don't know where to go to be safe, but we have something that direct them to turn to

01:07:11.530 --> 01:07:20.329
Proverbs chapter 18, and this is where we have a theme for this final talk here at our annual

01:07:20.329 --> 01:07:31.210
meeting. Proverbs 18 and verse 10. The name of Johova is a strong tower into it, the righteous one

01:07:31.210 --> 01:07:39.929
runs, and receives protection. Yes, as wickedness advances from bed to worse, we have to

01:07:39.929 --> 01:07:47.369
run to Johova to be protected, to be safe. And once we're in the tower to remain there, that means

01:07:47.369 --> 01:07:54.730
we look to Johova in faith and obedience, and we recognize how important it is to faithfully

01:07:54.730 --> 01:08:02.889
represent that name. So the purpose of this talk is to encourage all of us to run to Johova,

01:08:02.889 --> 01:08:09.929
the ones of us that have run to him, don't lose heart, and be busy teaching others that they

01:08:09.929 --> 01:08:18.810
better run to Johova before it's too late. Now, the end is very close in its obvious. Why is it

01:08:19.689 --> 01:08:24.970
obvious? Well, we're going to review some fundamental truths that are so spiritually fortifying,

01:08:25.609 --> 01:08:33.050
and you really can't review them often enough. Matthew chapter 24, and we're going to

01:08:35.449 --> 01:08:45.050
clearly emphasize why we know we're close. Matthew 24, after Jesus here, that has mentioned what's

01:08:45.050 --> 01:08:51.689
going to happen to the temple. And of course, he gets the third verse here, where the disciples

01:08:51.689 --> 01:08:57.770
and private approach him, which repeated James, John, and Andrew, and they want to know, when will

01:08:57.770 --> 01:09:03.529
these things be, and what will be the sign of your presence, and of the conclusion of the system of

01:09:03.529 --> 01:09:10.970
things? So this presence, referring to Jesus' enthronement as King and his royal visit to this

01:09:11.930 --> 01:09:17.289
earth. Now, what stands out that we have the increase of lawlessness, and you might keep in mind,

01:09:17.930 --> 01:09:25.449
that's not just criminal lawlessness, that's disdain for Johova's law. See, people forget that,

01:09:25.449 --> 01:09:32.810
and look at the disdain for Johova's law. Now, after he emphasizes in verse 36 that no human's

01:09:32.810 --> 01:09:40.569
going to know the day or the hour, notice what Jesus stated, verse 37, for just as the days of

01:09:40.569 --> 01:09:48.569
Noah were, so the presence of the Son of Man will be, for as they were on those days, before the

01:09:48.569 --> 01:09:54.250
flood eating and drinking, men marrying, and women being given in marriage, until the day that Noah

01:09:54.250 --> 01:10:01.529
entered into the ark, and they took no note, until the flood came and swept them all away, so the

01:10:01.529 --> 01:10:09.930
presence of the Son of Man will be. So there we have this clear comparison, he goes back to the days

01:10:09.930 --> 01:10:18.409
of Noah, and they took no note, and we see the same today, while we rejoice with the thousands

01:10:18.409 --> 01:10:24.329
that are dedicating themselves to Johova God and getting baptized each year, the fact is,

01:10:24.329 --> 01:10:30.409
all over the earth, by far the majority, take no note. They're busy about, they're daily affairs,

01:10:32.409 --> 01:10:39.130
and they're not interested. They don't want to run to Johova, it just doesn't have any appeal.

01:10:39.930 --> 01:10:48.890
To make such changes. Now, what sometimes seems to be forgotten is, found here in Genesis chapter 6,

01:10:48.890 --> 01:10:57.609
why did Johova take the action? Genesis chapter 6, let's remind ourselves of what really

01:10:58.489 --> 01:11:06.649
brought this to a head, to where Johova took action, and it's connected with our day,

01:11:07.369 --> 01:11:16.090
because this is what's motivating him to soon take action. Here we find Genesis 6 and verse 5,

01:11:17.609 --> 01:11:24.729
consequently, Johova saw that man's wickedness was great on the earth, and that every inclination

01:11:24.729 --> 01:11:30.729
of the thoughts of his heart was only bad all the time. Now notice this, it's very significant,

01:11:31.689 --> 01:11:39.529
verse 11, but the earth had become ruined in the sight of the true God. Why? The earth was filled

01:11:40.569 --> 01:11:49.689
with violence. Sound familiar? The earth was filled with violence. It stayed that way for some time,

01:11:49.689 --> 01:11:55.930
and then finally, Johova is fed up with the violence, and notice verse 13,

01:11:56.890 --> 01:12:06.489
after that God said to Noah, I have decided to put an end to all flesh because the earth is full

01:12:06.489 --> 01:12:16.489
of violence on account of them, so I'm bringing them to ruin together with the earth, full of violence.

01:12:17.369 --> 01:12:25.529
See, same thing today, this earth is full of violence, but that's what moved Johova to act,

01:12:26.090 --> 01:12:32.329
and then the violence continued in chapter 7 verse 1, go into the ark, after the years of

01:12:32.329 --> 01:12:42.649
constructing it, Johova had had enough of the violence. Now this is pertinent. In 1987, the May 15th

01:12:42.649 --> 01:12:50.970
Watchtower, page 20, paragraph 18, made this profound statement related to the flood in connecting

01:12:51.050 --> 01:12:58.170
it with our day. Many of those who died in the flood, no doubt considered themselves nice people,

01:12:59.289 --> 01:13:05.609
not being involved in the violence that filled society in those days, but just being nice did

01:13:05.609 --> 01:13:14.489
not save them. By their apathy, they condoned the evil of their day. The crucial thing was that

01:13:14.489 --> 01:13:23.050
they did not run to Johova. They did not listen when God servants spoke, so they did not take the

01:13:23.050 --> 01:13:33.609
proper steps for survival. And that's where we are now. See, people must understand, we have to

01:13:33.609 --> 01:13:41.289
preach and teach them, they need to run to Johova now before it's too late. And during his presence

01:13:41.289 --> 01:13:47.050
all through these decades ruling in the midst of his enemies, you have to accept the fact that

01:13:47.050 --> 01:13:56.810
the degree of violence at this point is mind-numbing. It's all over the earth, violence. And it

01:13:56.810 --> 01:14:03.930
isn't just because the media and the internet and such, it's just filled with violence.

01:14:04.729 --> 01:14:10.090
So that keep in mind, and we see that today, and something else Jesus connected when he was

01:14:10.090 --> 01:14:18.810
comparing his presence with the days of Noah, and note this here in Luke 17, and this is the second

01:14:18.810 --> 01:14:28.199
thing that just makes it very obvious, we are so close and Johova is going to take action.

01:14:30.199 --> 01:14:36.520
And this is his judgment now. We would have people in general, some countries would find

01:14:36.600 --> 01:14:42.760
what we're going to discuss here, hate mongering, but we will never water down,

01:14:43.239 --> 01:14:49.640
Johova's word. It's sticking close with it. These are the words of Jesus Christ. They want to take

01:14:49.640 --> 01:14:57.770
issue with him. Let him go ahead. Luke chapter 17, the Pharisees want to know when the kingdom's

01:14:57.770 --> 01:15:05.449
coming. Now in verse 26 of Luke 17, he makes the connection about the days of Noah, which we just

01:15:05.449 --> 01:15:14.250
addressed and how he entered into the ark. Now let's read 28 through 30, likewise. Just as it

01:15:14.250 --> 01:15:18.729
occurred in the days of Lot, they were eating, they were drinking, they were buying, they were selling,

01:15:18.729 --> 01:15:23.930
they were planning, they were building. But on the day that Lot went out of Sodom,

01:15:24.649 --> 01:15:32.329
it rained fire and sulfur from heaven and destroyed them all. It will be the same on that day

01:15:33.289 --> 01:15:42.109
when the Son of Man is revealed. Oh, yeah. When Jesus is revealed at the great tribulation,

01:15:42.829 --> 01:15:51.680
that's it. Johova's fed up with the sexual depravity as well. Now two other Bible writers

01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:58.319
connect these two events and that's why we see how close where if you look at the world today,

01:15:58.399 --> 01:16:06.560
it's right before our eyes. Notice Jude here. Let's turn over to Jude and he's inspired to

01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:21.930
encourage us, especially those who have already run to Johova. Jude 6, and we're going to read

01:16:23.770 --> 01:16:33.689
6 in the letter Jude. In the angels who did not keep their original position, but for

01:16:33.689 --> 01:16:41.130
sook their own proper dwelling place, he has reserved with eternal bonds in dense darkness

01:16:41.930 --> 01:16:50.250
for the judgment of the great day. So here we have it. This was a perversion, unnatural,

01:16:50.970 --> 01:16:58.170
and he's addressing this. Johova's inspired Jude to write this. These disobedient angels,

01:16:58.170 --> 01:17:05.130
they materialize bodies as we all know and cohabited with women and they produced offspring,

01:17:05.130 --> 01:17:13.449
half human, half demon. Very difficult time for the earth and Johova found that despicable. Now,

01:17:14.810 --> 01:17:21.130
this part of what happened prior to the flood of Noah's day is connected with verse 7,

01:17:21.609 --> 01:17:27.930
this sexual depravity, let's read verse 7, in the same manner,

01:17:29.770 --> 01:17:38.170
Sodom and Gomorrah, and the cities around them also gave themselves over to gross sexual

01:17:38.170 --> 01:17:46.329
immorality and pursued unnatural, fleshly desires. They are placed before us as a warning example

01:17:47.289 --> 01:17:56.489
by undergoing the judicial punishment of everlasting fire. So, Johova doesn't mention any words here.

01:17:57.289 --> 01:18:03.689
This sexual depravity found in the cities throughout this earth, he's had enough of it,

01:18:04.649 --> 01:18:10.649
and you'd have to admit that just like the scriptures bring out in Genesis,

01:18:11.609 --> 01:18:21.369
chapter 13 and 18, Johova said this cry of complaint was going up, and all of the perverted ones,

01:18:21.369 --> 01:18:30.409
and not just Sodom and Gomorrah, but the cities nearby, and this cry of complaint was just too much

01:18:30.409 --> 01:18:37.289
for Johova to take and he took action. See, however, what about our day? Well, the sexual depravity,

01:18:37.449 --> 01:18:49.770
they don't think they're depraved, and our saying so is judgmental, offensive, at least to them,

01:18:50.970 --> 01:18:56.250
and we don't intend to try to deliberately offend people, we just, this is what the scriptures

01:18:56.250 --> 01:19:05.369
teach. It's perverted, and we support Johova's judgment on that. However, the spirit of Satan's

01:19:05.449 --> 01:19:12.329
world is how foolish to believe that the story of the flood and the story of Sodom and Gomorrah are true.

01:19:13.449 --> 01:19:25.289
You people are foolish. Well, these stories are true, and Peter really makes it very clear here,

01:19:25.289 --> 01:19:36.199
as he's inspired to write this second Peter and the second chapter, and so we loved Johova for

01:19:36.199 --> 01:19:40.920
inspiring him to make this so clear, because it helps us to understand how close we are,

01:19:42.039 --> 01:19:50.439
and see second Peter 2, 4, through 6. Certainly, God did not reframe from punishing the angels

01:19:50.439 --> 01:19:55.479
who sinned, but through them into tiredness, supporting them in chains of dense darkness to be

01:19:55.479 --> 01:20:02.119
reserved for judgment, and he did not reframe from punishing an ancient world, but kept Noah,

01:20:02.199 --> 01:20:07.800
a preacher of righteousness, safe, with seven others when he brought a flood upon a world of

01:20:07.800 --> 01:20:15.640
ungodly people. Now notice this for found point, verse 6, and by reducing the cities of Sodom and

01:20:15.640 --> 01:20:24.039
Gomorrah to ashes, he condemned them setting a pattern for ungodly people of things to come.

01:20:24.840 --> 01:20:33.800
That's the pattern. All these ungodly people, what Johova did in the flood as well as in the

01:20:34.760 --> 01:20:41.319
day of Sodom and Gomorrah and judged them there, there's the pattern. That's their future if they

01:20:41.319 --> 01:20:50.199
choose not to run to Johova. So considering this scriptural evidence, the earth is filled with

01:20:50.279 --> 01:20:56.520
violence and sexual depravity, it's just so clear we're so close to the great tribulation

01:20:57.560 --> 01:21:02.439
and contemplating what may occur and it connects with brother Jackson's comments about the great

01:21:02.439 --> 01:21:08.920
tribulation. We just need to trust in Johova with all our heart and not lean on our own understanding.

01:21:08.920 --> 01:21:16.600
Say, and how reassuring to know that very soon no one will worry about their safety or the

01:21:16.600 --> 01:21:22.920
safety of their loved ones. The violence of the last days will be done away with all the sexually

01:21:22.920 --> 01:21:30.760
immoral people who brazenly flaunt our precious Johova's laws will be destroyed just as they were

01:21:30.760 --> 01:21:39.800
in Sodom and Gomorrah. So rest assured, Johova, here's our cry of complaint, do not lose heart.

01:21:39.800 --> 01:21:46.520
All you righteous worshipers of the true God remember, the name of Johova is a strong tower

01:21:46.600 --> 01:22:20.520
into it, the righteous runs and receives protection. Thank you very much for the

01:22:20.520 --> 01:22:27.880
more. So that was a fine conclusion to this wonderful program. We have received blessings of

01:22:27.880 --> 01:22:38.600
galore in the form of things that are true, serious concern, righteous, chase, lovable,

01:22:39.560 --> 01:22:46.920
well spoken on, virtuous, praiseworthy, good, and acceptable.

01:22:48.680 --> 01:22:56.279
We already announced that depending on the direction you will be going when you leave the building,

01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:04.520
you can use the side doors onto Pavonia Avenue or go through the main lobby and exit through the

01:23:04.600 --> 01:23:19.289
front. Well, is there any other announcement that I can make? Yes, there is. In fact, the governing

01:23:19.289 --> 01:23:28.489
body requested that the following announcement be made today. Are you ready? Well, let me set the

01:23:28.489 --> 01:23:37.449
stage for the announcement. As you might have guessed, there have been many questions and some

01:23:37.529 --> 01:23:45.050
wild speculations about the upcoming dedication program for the Wal-Kill and Warwick completed

01:23:45.050 --> 01:23:52.569
facilities. You're about to get the definitive answer. Our announcement reads this way.

01:23:53.930 --> 01:23:58.970
The governing body is pleased to inform you that the new facilities at Wal-Kill and Warwick will

01:23:58.970 --> 01:24:05.529
be dedicated in conjunction with the annual meeting program on October the 7th, 2017.

01:24:05.770 --> 01:24:12.970
The annual meeting and dedication program will originate from world headquarters in the auditorium

01:24:12.970 --> 01:24:22.010
at Warwick. Hence the number of attendees that will enjoy it live in the auditorium will be

01:24:22.010 --> 01:24:28.970
limited. However, the governing body has approved that the program will be streamed to all

01:24:28.970 --> 01:24:35.289
Bethel facilities in the United States and all assembly halls in the United States, including

01:24:35.289 --> 01:24:42.649
here at the Jersey City assembly hall. In this way, it is hoped that all who volunteered to work

01:24:42.649 --> 01:24:48.649
on the Wal-Kill and Warwick projects will be able to attend the annual meeting and the dedication

01:24:48.649 --> 01:24:57.050
program associated therewith. However, the program will not be streamed to other branch offices

01:24:57.050 --> 01:25:02.409
or assembly halls in other lands. The United States Branch Committee will be providing more

01:25:02.409 --> 01:25:09.130
details about the arrangements in due time. Again, the dedication of Wal-Kill and Warwick

01:25:09.130 --> 01:25:16.729
facilities will be in connection with the annual meeting on October the 7th, 2017. Your

01:25:16.729 --> 01:25:44.640
brothers, the governing body of Jehovah's Witnesses. That brings us to the conclusion of our program,

01:25:44.640 --> 01:25:52.079
and I invite all of you to stand and sing another of our new songs. We know it for the time being

01:25:52.079 --> 01:26:01.039
as song number 136. The kingdom is in place and let it come. Please sing this majestic song with

01:26:01.039 --> 01:26:09.199
full throat just as it deserves. Song number 136.
