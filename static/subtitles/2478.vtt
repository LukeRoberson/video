WEBVTT

00:00:08.939 --> 00:00:10.939
You got this for him.

00:00:10.939 --> 00:00:12.939
Go, go, go.

00:00:12.939 --> 00:00:13.939
Yes.

00:00:13.939 --> 00:00:18.089
Bro, that was good.

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:55.539
His friends.

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:59.200
When we see throughout the Gospel accounts

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.200
that those who chose to be a friend to Jesus

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.200
gain the best friend possible.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:15.290
Oh, you like to draw?

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.290
I like your notes.

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.290
Really cool.

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:21.290
Mom taught me.

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.290
They just helped me remember.

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.290
Me too.

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.290
So, looks like we have a talk together.

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:30.290
Yeah.

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.290
I'll get in touch to practice soon.

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.290
Lydia, we're leaving.

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.290
Well, I gotta go.

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:37.290
See you later, Sophia.

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:43.280
Hey, bro.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.280
Hey, good to see you.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.719
I'm glad I was on your team.

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:52.719
My favorite thing was the Safari Treehouse.

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:56.719
Yeah, it had all the cool jungle animals on the wall.

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:59.719
Timmy, I didn't think your team was gonna make it.

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:04.719
I love my prize.

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:06.719
You got a prize?

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:11.129
We all did.

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:28.419
Okay, kids.

00:02:28.419 --> 00:02:30.419
Settle down.

00:02:30.419 --> 00:02:31.419
Time to get started.

00:02:31.419 --> 00:02:39.770
We have a lot to talk about today.

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.770
Before we begin, for those of you that participated

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:44.770
in the Science Club this weekend,

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:48.770
we will be having another camping trip.

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.770
But only the ones with the highest score on the math project

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:53.770
will be selected to go.

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.770
More on that after class.

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:56.770
Hey.

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:57.770
Now, today.

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:58.770
We need you in our club.

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.770
You're good at science.

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:02.770
We have another trip coming up.

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:25.439
So, anyway, all the kids had badges and prizes and stuff.

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:28.439
And it sounded like a lot of fun.

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:32.689
And it seems like they really need my help.

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:37.759
Hmm, I see.

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:40.759
Oh, you see what's wrong with the car?

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:42.759
No, I wish.

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:45.759
No, I see why you want to be in the club.

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:47.759
You do?

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:48.759
Of course.

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:51.759
We all want to have friends and do fun things.

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:54.759
Please, would you mind moving the light over here?

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:55.759
Uh, right there.

00:03:55.759 --> 00:04:01.689
Thank you.

00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:08.110
I just wish I had some kid friends.

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:11.110
Johova wants you and me to have friends.

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.110
But the question you need to ask yourself is,

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:17.389
who should be my friend?

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:21.670
Let's talk about it at our next family worship.

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:27.199
How about you go do some research on Martha?

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:30.990
And I will talk Caleb too.

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:32.990
And then we can come back together

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:38.509
and talk about it as a family.

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:40.509
Sofia, are you ready?

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:42.949
Yeah.

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:48.949
Martha, a Jewish, a sister of Lazarus, and Mary.

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:53.519
They lived in Bethany.

00:04:53.519 --> 00:04:57.519
A village about two miles away from Jerusalem.

00:04:57.519 --> 00:05:00.519
Which was probably Jesus' home base

00:05:00.519 --> 00:05:02.519
when he came down from Galilee.

00:05:02.519 --> 00:05:04.519
Martha liked to cook.

00:05:04.519 --> 00:05:06.519
Yes, she did.

00:05:06.519 --> 00:05:09.800
And she would cook for Jesus

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.800
and all his disciples when they would visit.

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.360
That would have been a lot of food.

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.360
Yes.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.360
And a lot of work.

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:26.360
But if they work together, they make it a success.

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:30.360
However, some of their friends felt differently about Jesus.

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:42.000
Martha makes the best apricot cakes.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
It's just a fact.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
You always praise me too much, Talia.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
Well, if it gets me more apricot cakes,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
I will continue to praise you.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.009
Oh, Talia, did you hear?

00:05:56.009 --> 00:05:58.009
The teacher Jesus.

00:05:58.009 --> 00:06:00.009
He's coming back to visit.

00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:02.009
The man from Galilee?

00:06:02.009 --> 00:06:06.009
Are you hosting him again?

00:06:06.009 --> 00:06:08.009
Yes, I am.

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:10.009
Actually, it's tonight.

00:06:10.009 --> 00:06:12.959
Gotta talk.

00:06:12.959 --> 00:06:16.959
The Pharisees in Jerusalem, they don't approve of that man.

00:06:16.959 --> 00:06:20.959
I am not sure it's such a good idea for you to be known as his friend.

00:06:20.959 --> 00:06:28.319
Okay, well, I guess I better be getting home.

00:06:28.319 --> 00:06:29.319
See you too later.

00:06:29.319 --> 00:06:54.370
Martha, Jesus is here.

00:06:54.370 --> 00:07:48.550
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:50.550
Let me get this straight.

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:55.550
He wanted you and Mary to sit and learn about God just like the men.

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:59.550
The teacher instructing women, a woman's job,

00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:02.550
is to provide food for her household.

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:04.550
That's true.

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:07.550
A good woman prepares herself for hard work.

00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:11.550
That's valuable. That's you, Martha.

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:14.550
Don't let this Jesus ruin you with his ideas.

00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:40.500
Lazarus, kind of you.

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:42.500
How is he doing?

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:44.500
Not well.

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:46.500
I sent word to Jesus.

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:48.500
He will help my brother.

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:50.500
You sent word to Jesus?

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:53.500
Have you still not heard?

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:56.500
He's angering people with his shocking speech.

00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:59.500
He's claiming to be God's son.

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:01.500
He's crazy.

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:04.500
He's loyal to Jehovah, and he is our friend.

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:19.429
Sadly, Lazarus died.

00:09:19.429 --> 00:09:22.429
But do you remember what happened next?

00:09:22.429 --> 00:09:27.429
Jesus came back to Bethany and was erected Lazarus.

00:09:28.429 --> 00:09:31.429
Jesus was a real friend.

00:09:31.429 --> 00:09:35.429
He cared about Martha, Mary, and Lazarus.

00:09:35.429 --> 00:09:39.429
And he showed them what kind of friend Jehovah can be to us.

00:09:39.429 --> 00:09:42.429
But that's not where this story ends.

00:09:42.429 --> 00:09:45.429
Do you know what some people did after that?

00:09:45.429 --> 00:09:49.429
Many of the Jews who saw what he did put faith in him.

00:09:49.429 --> 00:09:52.429
But some of them went off to the Pharisees

00:09:52.429 --> 00:09:55.429
and told them what Jesus had done.

00:09:55.429 --> 00:09:57.429
Why did they do that?

00:09:57.429 --> 00:10:01.429
Because not even seeing Jesus bring someone back to life

00:10:01.429 --> 00:10:04.429
was enough to convince them that he was the Christ.

00:10:04.429 --> 00:10:09.450
They seemed like Martha's friends.

00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:14.240
But they hated Jesus.

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:20.860
How do you think Martha dealt with her unbelieving friends?

00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:22.860
Jesus is the Christ.

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:24.860
The resurrection and the life.

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:27.860
He is the Son of God.

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:33.960
And he is my friend.

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:36.960
You've been kind to me in the past.

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:39.960
But you don't believe Jesus' teachings.

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:41.960
We cannot be friends.

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:56.100
Martha stuck with Jesus and his friends.

00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:59.100
They helped her become Jehovah's friend.

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:18.159
So Sophia, what do you think Jehovah's teaching you about friendship?

00:11:18.159 --> 00:11:22.440
That I have to choose my friends carefully.

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:25.440
And how can you know if someone should be your friend?

00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:32.799
If they help me be Jehovah's friend,

00:11:32.799 --> 00:11:35.799
I'm not going to join the club.

00:11:35.799 --> 00:11:37.799
That's my girl.

00:11:37.799 --> 00:11:40.799
We are so proud of you, Sophia.

00:11:40.799 --> 00:11:43.799
And Jehovah is proud of you too.

00:11:43.799 --> 00:11:46.799
Now, how about you go finish up your homework?

00:11:46.799 --> 00:11:49.799
Mum tells me we have a guest coming over.

00:11:49.799 --> 00:11:50.799
Okay.

00:11:50.799 --> 00:12:02.929
Jehovah, please help me find a good friend.

00:12:02.929 --> 00:12:10.500
Someone who loves you.

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:18.190
Please, you are my friend.

00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:19.190
I talk.

00:12:28.049 --> 00:12:29.049
Do you like turtles?

00:12:29.049 --> 00:12:31.049
I love turtles.

00:12:31.049 --> 00:12:38.299
I've got something I want to show you.

00:12:38.299 --> 00:12:50.100
It is so cute.

00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:53.100
You know, Sophia, I think we're going to be friends.

00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:56.340
Yep, definitely friends.
