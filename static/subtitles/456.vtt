00:00:01.179 --> 00:00:04.740
During this COVID pandemic,

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.320
it's not hard for negative feelings

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.660
to begin to form in our minds.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.580
We may begin to think a lot about things

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.800
that we were able to do in the past.

00:00:16.739 --> 00:00:17.699
For us at Bethel,

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.059
maybe it's thinking about some of the speaking assignments

00:00:21.059 --> 00:00:23.140
that we had in various congregations

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.859
being with different brothers and sisters

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.100
and getting to meet different ones.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.539
Maybe we even think about when we served

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.780
as Bethel representatives at circuit assemblies

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.899
or regional conventions with large, large crowds

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:39.420
of our brothers and sisters.

00:00:40.299 --> 00:00:42.780
Elders in the field may think about the work

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.100
that they did for many, many years

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.259
on convention committees or in organizing large departments

00:00:49.259 --> 00:00:51.939
either at conventions or at assemblies.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.939
Pioneers might be thinking about what they did

00:00:55.939 --> 00:01:00.100
during the special metropolitan public witnessing program

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.619
or just in public witnessing in general.

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:05.980
And then there's all of the pioneers

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:09.620
that have commuted to Bethel some for many years

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.019
to support our work.

00:01:12.019 --> 00:01:16.579
Well, all of these involve different assignments,

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:20.459
but there's one thing that they all have in common.

00:01:20.459 --> 00:01:24.980
We all have had to hit the pause button

00:01:25.019 --> 00:01:29.379
on all of these assignments that we loved so much.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.579
Well, sometimes we may begin to ask ourselves,

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:37.060
does the fact that I no longer can do these assignments

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:42.060
that I loved so much mean that somehow I've lost value

00:01:42.379 --> 00:01:45.219
that I'm not as precious to Jehovah anymore?

00:01:46.739 --> 00:01:49.859
Well, this is where our text can be so helpful to us.

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:51.299
Let's read it again.

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.019
Let's go in our Bibles to Philippians.

00:01:55.379 --> 00:02:00.859
Chapter two, and let's read together verses five to seven.

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:02.980
Let's read all three verses.

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:06.299
It says, keep this mental attitude in you

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.139
that was also in Christ Jesus,

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:12.580
who although he was existing in God's form

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.539
gave no consideration to a seizure,

00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:18.780
namely that he should be equal to God.

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.780
No, but now let's focus on this.

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.780
No, but he emptied himself and took a slave's form

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.020
and became human.

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:34.819
When I was just a few words there,

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.659
but can you imagine what was involved in that last expression?

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:44.340
He emptied himself and took a slave's form.

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:49.219
It's really hard for us even to begin to imagine

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:52.419
the position that Jesus occupied in the heavens

00:02:52.419 --> 00:02:54.099
before he came to earth.

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:55.819
Maybe we get a little glimpse of it.

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:57.060
If we go in our Bibles,

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:03.650
let's read together Colossians, chapter one,

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.289
and let's look at verse 15.

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:08.889
Now speaking about Jesus, it says,

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:12.610
he is the image of the invisible God,

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.129
the firstborn of all creation.

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:17.770
Because by means of him,

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:21.050
all other things were created in the heavens

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.889
and on the earth, the things visible and the things invisible,

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:27.770
whether they are thrones or lordships

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:29.930
or governments or authorities,

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.930
all other things have been created through him and for him.

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:39.610
Also, he is before all other things

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:44.090
and by means of him, all other things were made to exist.

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:48.250
Well, yes, as the master worker,

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:53.250
Jesus was used by his father in the creation of the universe

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.969
and all of the things in it.

00:03:55.969 --> 00:03:57.889
John chapter one, verse three,

00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:01.930
says, all things came into existence through him

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.930
and apart from him, not even one thing came into existence.

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:13.090
What an amazing role Jesus played in heaven.

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.889
But Jesus was willing to give up that position in heaven

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:22.889
and accept the assignment that Jehovah had for him here on the earth.

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:27.730
But now what did accepting that assignment involve?

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:29.810
Now let's look at three different things.

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.370
We might be finding the lockdown challenging,

00:04:35.329 --> 00:04:39.569
especially after seven months, but consider this.

00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:43.050
Jesus had to be in the womb of Mary

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.370
as a helpless embryo for nine months.

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.649
Can you imagine what a change that was for him?

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:51.730
Let's consider a second thing.

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:56.209
Jesus had been the spokesman for Jehovah in heaven.

00:04:56.209 --> 00:05:00.449
But now Jesus would have to learn to speak

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:03.290
and be taught by imperfect humans.

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:06.050
Let's consider a third one.

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:10.569
In heaven, his associates had been faithful, powerful,

00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:12.290
heavenly spirit creatures.

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:15.329
But now on earth, who were his associates?

00:05:16.209 --> 00:05:19.170
Fisherman, former prostitutes,

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:24.050
just the very common, simple, humble people,

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:29.050
who the Pharisees in John chapter seven in verse 49 called a curse.

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:32.930
Well, what do you think?

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:37.329
Was that a major change for Jesus to leave his heavenly position

00:05:37.329 --> 00:05:38.970
and come to the earth?

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:43.970
He truly emptied himself as Philippians two verse seven says.

00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:46.050
But now, here's the question.

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:51.089
Did Jesus feel that somehow he had lost value with Jehovah

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:55.250
because he had gone through such a huge change in his assignment?

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:58.930
And now was a human on earth, not for a moment.

00:06:00.129 --> 00:06:00.769
But why?

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:03.490
Well, would you open your Bibles?

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:09.629
Let's read together this thought in the book of John chapter eight.

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:15.069
And let's look, let's look together here at verse 29.

00:06:15.949 --> 00:06:17.709
Jesus said,

00:06:17.709 --> 00:06:22.110
and the one who sent me is with me.

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:26.430
He did not abandon me to myself

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:30.910
because I always do the things pleasing to him.

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:33.069
Isn't that a beautiful verse?

00:06:33.069 --> 00:06:37.069
You see, Jesus knew that the work that he was doing

00:06:37.069 --> 00:06:40.589
was the work his father had asked him to do.

00:06:40.589 --> 00:06:44.029
It was not the same work that he had done

00:06:44.189 --> 00:06:49.470
when he was in heaven, but he was still always doing the things

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:51.069
that were pleasing to his father.

00:06:51.949 --> 00:06:55.149
And for that reason, Jesus knew in his heart

00:06:55.949 --> 00:06:59.870
that Jehovah God would certainly never abandon him.

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:05.550
He kept busy working hard in his present assignment,

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:09.310
not focusing on what he had done in the past.

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:13.310
When our brothers and sisters, what do we learn from this?

00:07:14.829 --> 00:07:19.230
We've all had some changes, some of them even major changes

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:21.310
in our assignments because of the pandemic.

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:25.069
But our primary goal has never changed.

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:30.189
Just like Jesus, we continually seek to do the things

00:07:30.189 --> 00:07:32.670
pleasing to our Heavenly Father, Jehovah.

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:35.790
Now, we can't go from door to door right now

00:07:36.509 --> 00:07:38.189
and we can't do public witnessing

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:42.029
and we can't meet at our kingdom halls or assembly halls and so on.

00:07:42.829 --> 00:07:46.829
But because we all love Jehovah,

00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:50.829
we find ways even in the midst of this pandemic

00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:52.829
to do things that please him.

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:55.790
Now, the Watchtower made an interesting comment.

00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:59.709
The Watchtower of August 2020, page 25.

00:07:59.709 --> 00:08:00.509
Here's what it said.

00:08:01.949 --> 00:08:05.550
Do you get discouraged because you currently do not have

00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:08.350
the same privileges of service that you had in the past?

00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:13.790
If so, you will be happier if you change your focus

00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:17.629
and concentrate on what you can do right now

00:08:18.509 --> 00:08:20.990
to serve Jehovah and your brothers.

00:08:21.629 --> 00:08:25.470
Stay busy using your gifts and abilities to help others

00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:29.629
and you will find joy as you build up the congregation.

00:08:30.829 --> 00:08:32.909
Well, that's what we're all trying to do.

00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:36.990
And Jehovah loves us because we're trying.

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:39.470
And he blesses our efforts.

00:08:40.029 --> 00:08:43.870
Now, take this experience that one sister had in the United States.

00:08:44.509 --> 00:08:48.110
She had sent out some letters as a part of her ministry

00:08:48.669 --> 00:08:51.710
and imagine how surprised this dear sister was

00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:55.710
to receive a letter from a lady that we're going to call Mary.

00:08:56.830 --> 00:08:58.190
Here's what this letter said.

00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:04.350
Hello, my name is Mary and I want to thank you for sending me a beautiful letter.

00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:08.750
I was at Jehovah's Witness between the ages of 9 and 12.

00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:11.309
My mother was a full-time pioneer.

00:09:12.509 --> 00:09:16.110
I was, we would go door to door daily.

00:09:16.669 --> 00:09:20.909
But as young as I was and already having the taste of birthdays and holidays,

00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:23.789
I left my mom to live with my dad.

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:27.549
My mom pioneered for over 25 years.

00:09:27.549 --> 00:09:29.389
She died in 2007.

00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:32.750
Though at my young age, I was not close to her.

00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:35.710
In my adult years, we became best friends.

00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:41.309
To her dying days, she would tell me, Mary, return to Jehovah.

00:09:42.429 --> 00:09:45.149
I just never felt I could live up to the standards.

00:09:45.149 --> 00:09:46.750
I didn't want to be a hypocrite.

00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:48.750
That's my big issue and not studying.

00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:50.429
You can't keep one toe in.

00:09:50.429 --> 00:09:51.710
It's all or nothing.

00:09:53.149 --> 00:09:55.470
After my mom died at her memorial,

00:09:56.190 --> 00:09:57.950
she had a sister give me a Bible.

00:09:58.509 --> 00:10:00.590
And on the front of the Bible, she inscribed,

00:10:01.149 --> 00:10:03.070
to Mary, from mom,

00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:06.029
returned to me in paradise.

00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:09.710
I want to see her so bad.

00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:13.149
And I know the only way to do so is to return to Jehovah.

00:10:13.149 --> 00:10:14.509
But I get scared.

00:10:14.509 --> 00:10:15.870
What if I can't do it right?

00:10:16.429 --> 00:10:17.629
I don't want to mess up.

00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:22.830
Every night, I say my prayers to Jehovah as I have done.

00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:25.870
But on August 19, 2020, I said my prayers.

00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:27.789
But this time I asked Jehovah,

00:10:27.789 --> 00:10:30.830
Jehovah, you know how I feel and you know my heart.

00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:34.830
I want to connect to a church or a religion to praise you.

00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:36.509
I said, Jehovah, you know me.

00:10:36.509 --> 00:10:40.590
It almost has to be a brick to hit me to understand what's right.

00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:48.029
On August 20, the very next day, I went to get the mail and I received your letter.

00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:50.269
I could not believe it.

00:10:50.269 --> 00:10:51.470
I was so shocked.

00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:55.389
I actually sat down and thought, wow, now what do I do?

00:10:55.950 --> 00:10:59.950
Jehovah answered, now I need to follow through and I'm nervous.

00:11:01.309 --> 00:11:04.429
I hope that you can help me take the steps I need to take.

00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:09.389
Again, I'm scared, but I hope that I can make the changes I need to make.

00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:11.789
Sincerely, Mary.

00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:15.789
Well, that's the power of one letter.

00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:18.269
It's true.

00:11:18.269 --> 00:11:22.590
We've had to press that pause button on many of the assignments

00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:24.429
that we have just loved doing.

00:11:24.909 --> 00:11:27.470
But does that mean that we've lost value with Jehovah?

00:11:28.669 --> 00:11:31.070
Jehovah is still with us.

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:37.549
We have not lost any value with him and he is not going to abandon us.

00:11:37.549 --> 00:11:40.350
So what do we need to do like Jesus?

00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:43.309
Let's not focus on what we used to do.

00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:50.830
But instead, let's do everything we can do right now to do all the things pleasing

00:11:50.830 --> 00:11:53.470
to our wonderful Heavenly Father, Jehovah.
