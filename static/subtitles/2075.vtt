00:00:01.899 --> 00:00:07.900
The squib complex was purchased by the Society back in 1969.

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:12.900
At that time, of course, all the printing in the United States was done here in Brooklyn.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:22.100
Jehovah's Witnesses have always been interested in advertising.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:42.170
So it seemed natural that we'd want to advertise the watch tower on one of our buildings here in New York City.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:52.740
The sign is constructed from aluminum sheeting, and the letters were made right on the 12th floor of the 30 building.

00:00:52.740 --> 00:01:01.049
They were heavy, and so we had to handle them very gingerly, making sure that we didn't damage any of the tubes.

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:10.150
And one by one, we hoisted them up in position on the structure.

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:27.189
A couple of us went across the river, including the artist that had laid out the sign originally.

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:34.260
And we went over to one of the peers in Manhattan.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:39.260
We thought that we'd had better check it carefully to make sure the spacing of the letters were correct.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:45.260
That his binoculars, he could look at the sign carefully.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:52.260
So once we had everything in place, brothers proceeded to bolt all the letters in position.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:02:02.109
He thought it was quite amazing that anyone who had no experience in building on signs would tackle such a huge job.

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:17.840
It was pretty scared about trying to go up to the watch tower sign when they first talked about it.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:24.400
What made me have more confidence is knowing that other girls have done it.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:39.680
I'm in the electrical department, and I changed lights throughout the 25, 30 Columbia Heights buildings.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.680
And one of the things I get a chance to do is change the lights on the watch tower sign.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:03:01.150
I think the most interesting story is about the watch tower sign is just that it has become a place that people are used to seeing.

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:21.860
Every time you walk to Brooklyn Bridge and Tourist, especially when we have visitors come down, witnesses, but even local, they know where watch tower is because the sign is here.

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:28.860
As for his future, it will probably remain with that building as long as we remain with that building.
