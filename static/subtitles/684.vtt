WEBVTT

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.539
We live in very stressful times.

00:00:10.539 --> 00:00:17.620
First Peter 5.8 indicates that Satan the Devil is bitterly angry and walks about like a

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:20.500
roaring lion.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:27.100
Throughout the Bible, we learn that God-fearing worshipers of Jehovah in the past face circumstances

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.420
that produce anxiety.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:41.380
For example at Psalm 132, King David asks, How long will I have anxious concern with grief

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:45.420
in my heart each day?

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:56.750
Please find with me Luke 22, verses 42 through 44.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:02.710
Even Jesus, a perfect man, experienced the agony of intense anxiety on the night of

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.510
his betrayal.

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:08.510
Here is what he prayed in Luke 22, 42.

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:18.590
Father, if you want to remove this cup from me, nevertheless let not my will, but yours

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.730
take place.

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.129
He knew what he was in for.

00:01:25.129 --> 00:01:27.769
Well, what happened?

00:01:27.769 --> 00:01:29.010
Verse 43.

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:36.650
Then an angel from heaven appeared to him and strengthened him.

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.370
An angel was dispatched to encourage Jesus.

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:44.569
Did that instantly erase his anxious concerns?

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:45.569
No.

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:48.569
Let's read verse 44.

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:57.409
But he was in such agony that he kept praying more earnestly and his sweat became as

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:03.569
drops of blood falling to the ground.

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:06.810
Have you ever been that anxious about anything?

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.530
Your sweat becoming drops of blood probably not.

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:18.770
But you did not have the salvation of the world of mankind on your shoulders.

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:28.090
The point is that all of Jehovah's servants in these last days will have bouts of anxiety.

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:35.289
For many around the world it might be the high cost of food, clothing and shelter.

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:42.050
In the wake of the pandemic this anxiety likely is being experienced by more of our brothers

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:46.810
than would normally be the case.

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:52.770
Some of you live in neighborhoods with a high crime rate and violence all around.

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:59.969
Others face temptations from workmaids or schoolmaids to be dishonest or immoral.

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:08.250
In their family issues, health issues, emotional issues, the deaths of loved ones, all of these

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.569
can be causes for anxiety.

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:18.569
Still others of our brothers and sisters face mistreatment and abuse from family members,

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:26.889
governmental oppression, and from false religious elements that foment hate and prejudice.

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:36.289
The title of this talk is, strive for calm when facing anxious times.

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:39.289
Is calm even possible?

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:43.449
Jehovah came to the assistance of his servants in the past.

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:51.169
Today he makes it possible for us to gain a measure of calm when facing distress or anxiety.

00:03:51.169 --> 00:03:59.099
Locate 1 Peter 5, 6 and 7, please.

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:04.180
Verse 7 describes an action we can take with our anxiety.

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.979
Let's read verses 6 and 7.

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:15.979
Humble yourselves, therefore under the mighty hand of God, so that he may exalt you in

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:27.139
due time, while you throw all your anxiety on him, because he cares for you.

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:30.500
Did you notice the time element in verse 6?

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:39.620
It is said that Jehovah will exalt you in due time, so not necessarily immediately.

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:45.019
If you're facing anxious moments, what do you do in the meantime?

00:04:45.019 --> 00:04:55.540
It is the action that's described in verse 7, throw all your anxiety on Jehovah.

00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:00.459
If we throw something, what are we left holding in our hand?

00:05:00.459 --> 00:05:02.100
Nothing.

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:06.220
We don't keep the anxiety bottled up inside ourself.

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:11.259
We throw all of it on our God.

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:17.220
You might be thinking, my anxiety is so heavy and burdensome, I can't even pick it up,

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:19.899
let alone throw it anywhere.

00:05:19.899 --> 00:05:32.600
Let's look at a related scripture in the book of Psalms, Psalm 37.5.

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:39.680
Instead of throw, it uses the word commit, verse 5.

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:49.100
Commit your way to Jehovah, rely on him and he will act in your behalf.

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:51.939
It said commit your way.

00:05:51.939 --> 00:05:58.980
The footnote says this could be translated, roll your way up on Jehovah.

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:06.939
So if your anxiety seems too heavy to throw on Jehovah, give it a push, try rolling it

00:06:06.939 --> 00:06:09.100
on him.

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:17.300
How do we throw commit or roll our anxious thoughts on Jehovah?

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:23.509
Let's open our Bibles to Philippians 4, verses 6 and 7.

00:06:23.509 --> 00:06:34.470
Do not be anxious over anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication, along with thanksgiving,

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:43.389
let your petitions be made known to God, and the peace of God that surpasses all understanding

00:06:43.389 --> 00:06:52.620
will guard your hearts and your mental powers by means of Christ Jesus.

00:06:52.620 --> 00:07:03.019
We throw our role or anxiety on Jehovah by means of fervent prayer.

00:07:03.019 --> 00:07:06.180
Pour your heart out to God.

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:12.220
You can tell Jehovah anything, even if it is embarrassing to you.

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:18.699
Remember, Jehovah is not going to tell anyone about it.

00:07:18.699 --> 00:07:23.060
Go our role it on him.

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:27.500
And what did verse 7 say would be the result of such prayers?

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:30.259
It said the peace of God.

00:07:30.259 --> 00:07:34.259
He has a calm tranquility.

00:07:34.259 --> 00:07:41.500
Comes over us when we fully trust Jehovah's power to sustain us.

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:45.019
How else can our heart calm down?

00:07:45.019 --> 00:07:50.720
Pour your anxiety with trusted friends in the congregation, including an elder you

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:53.139
feel comfortable with.

00:07:53.139 --> 00:08:01.019
Hebrews 10-25 says, When we meet together, we receive encouragement.

00:08:01.019 --> 00:08:08.740
Or in these uncertain times, instead of meeting together, it might be letters, emails,

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:17.500
or texts from your concern to brothers and sisters will have a similar effect.

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:25.860
What else can have a calming effect on us, reading applicable portions of God's word and

00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:28.779
meditating on them?

00:08:28.779 --> 00:08:43.470
For example, Isaiah 41, Is this describing walking hand in hand with God, or is this describing

00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:50.230
Jehovah reaching into your life and saving you from calamity and anxiety?

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:54.990
Let's compare two verses in Isaiah 41.

00:08:54.990 --> 00:09:02.070
Notice his promise in verse 10, Do not be afraid, for I am with you.

00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:06.269
Do not be anxious, for I am your God.

00:09:06.269 --> 00:09:15.590
I will fortify you, yes I will help you, I will really hold on to you with my right hand

00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:19.649
of righteousness.

00:09:19.649 --> 00:09:25.370
Did you notice Jehovah tells you not to be afraid or anxious?

00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:27.169
Why?

00:09:27.169 --> 00:09:32.250
Because he will hold on to you with his right hand.

00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:41.610
In verse 11 and 12, it describes some tragic circumstances we might face in life.

00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:51.250
Now verse 13, For I, Jehovah, your God, am grasping your right hand, the one saying to

00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:59.159
you, Do not be afraid, I will help you.

00:09:59.159 --> 00:10:01.240
Did you see the point?

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:04.799
This is not describing a stroll with God.

00:10:04.799 --> 00:10:09.960
This is not describing walking hand in hand with God.

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:14.559
This is a rescue mission by God.

00:10:14.559 --> 00:10:21.440
If it was a casual stroll with God, your left hand would be in his right hand.

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:31.000
But the two verses say that Jehovah grasps your right hand and with his right hand.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000
It is as if Jehovah is facing you.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.480
He sees your dire plight.

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:47.320
He reaches out with his right hand and grasp your right hand and pulls you up out to safety.

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:53.830
Specific Bible verses, calm us down and reassure us.

00:10:53.830 --> 00:11:00.750
The three aspects we've considered, one prayer, two encouragement from our brothers and

00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:07.669
three, meditating on the scriptures, were mentioned by four brothers in Russia who have

00:11:07.669 --> 00:11:11.149
been convicted to prison senses.

00:11:11.149 --> 00:11:17.200
Please watch the following video.

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:23.919
I was detained at the airport at 4 in the morning, right at the checking desk an FSB officer

00:11:23.919 --> 00:11:30.639
came up to us and said that investigative measures were being taken against us.

00:11:30.639 --> 00:11:36.000
There was a knock at the door and I understood that they had come for me.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.080
It all happened very quickly.

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:43.679
First they detained us, then they handcuffed us, then they searched us.

00:11:43.679 --> 00:11:49.159
A jeep with tinted windows blocked the road, then with shouts of, stay where you are.

00:11:49.159 --> 00:11:53.799
They twisted my arms and threw me onto the hood of my automobile.

00:11:53.799 --> 00:11:58.480
The next day, a court imposed preventive measures on me and I was taken to the pretrial detention

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:01.559
facility in Habarovsk.

00:12:01.559 --> 00:12:06.799
I was taken to a dark room in the prison and shot in, then I got on my knees and prayed

00:12:06.799 --> 00:12:11.919
to Jehovah telling him that I wanted to stand firm in the face of the trials and remain

00:12:11.919 --> 00:12:16.960
faithful to him.

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:23.440
When I was in the detention cell, every evening I prayed for my friends, my wife, my children,

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:30.480
everyone I know and tried to think about their circumstances and pray specifically.

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:36.080
I started praying to Jehovah for help with tears because things were getting very difficult

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:37.159
for me.

00:12:37.159 --> 00:12:42.759
But then things started changing, which as I understood, Jehovah had already arranged

00:12:42.759 --> 00:12:44.519
at the start of that day.

00:12:44.519 --> 00:12:50.240
I prayed for boldness and to be courageous, calm and kind and Jehovah gave me the strength

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:51.240
for that.

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:56.159
I felt calm when I talked with them and I didn't feel afraid of consequences or anything.

00:12:56.159 --> 00:13:01.600
I prayed to Jehovah and asked him to show me that he was close by, that he was doing something

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:05.440
and that the whole situation was under his control.

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:09.039
And the first letter I received that morning was about the sun.

00:13:09.039 --> 00:13:13.879
Interestingly, I had read a lot of articles about the sun and understood that Jehovah's

00:13:13.879 --> 00:13:18.240
immense strength and power are manifested in it.

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:24.460
But that day I especially felt it.

00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:29.899
The first letters that I received were about God's qualities and about the qualities that

00:13:29.899 --> 00:13:33.659
I needed to display in that specific situation.

00:13:33.659 --> 00:13:36.539
They weren't just encouraging to me.

00:13:36.539 --> 00:13:40.379
They were also fine witnesses to the administration.

00:13:40.379 --> 00:13:44.539
The guards who were amazed, they asked Vanya, who is writing to you from Krasnodar, I've

00:13:44.539 --> 00:13:47.019
got friends there and then about other places.

00:13:47.019 --> 00:13:50.019
They wrote to me from friends from America.

00:13:50.019 --> 00:13:55.820
The letters enabled them to see that the situation is under the control of a huge number of

00:13:55.820 --> 00:14:00.100
people who know about me, about my circumstances.

00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:03.740
The actions I've been carefully observed by many people.

00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:09.539
Talks, topics for talks, items for meetings, these are things I took from the letters that

00:14:09.539 --> 00:14:12.580
I received each day.

00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:18.220
From one letter I would take, for example, material for a 10 minute talk and from another I could

00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:19.860
make a public talk.

00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:22.659
This I was able to collect quotes from various letters.

00:14:22.659 --> 00:14:25.100
I eventually had an entire library.

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:30.820
I was able to compare and collect information and then conduct high quality, excellent personal

00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:35.100
study that helped me keep in step with the organization at that time.

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:38.100
A boy drew a picture and sent it to me.

00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:45.139
He wrote, if you remain faithful, you will be in the new world.

00:14:45.139 --> 00:14:49.820
An elderly sister began to let her with these warm words.

00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:52.860
Greetings, my son.

00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:56.850
She shared her feelings with me.

00:14:56.850 --> 00:15:03.500
He later came at one of the most difficult times for me.

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:15.220
I felt that Jehovah comforts us in a special way through letters.

00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:17.379
I met the following schedule.

00:15:17.379 --> 00:15:25.299
I got up early in the morning at 5'30, while everyone else in the cell was snoozing and

00:15:25.299 --> 00:15:30.500
all was quiet, I was able to read the Bible.

00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:33.700
I would think a great deal about a particular verse.

00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:38.340
The more I reflected on it, the more I saw how beautiful it was.

00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:43.139
By the end of the day the verse would have become stunningly beautiful and unique to me.

00:15:43.139 --> 00:15:48.259
Then I understood that a good heart is warmed, not by the amount that you take in, but by

00:15:48.259 --> 00:15:51.340
the amount you can retain in your heart.

00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:56.220
When you read the Bible in a pre-trial detention cell, it takes on a new meaning.

00:15:56.220 --> 00:16:02.659
When I read a book of Acts, the things that happened to Paul became especially understandable,

00:16:02.659 --> 00:16:10.690
strengthened me, and showed me that I could get through these times just as he did.

00:16:10.690 --> 00:16:14.570
Mordecai's experience from the Bible went to my heart.

00:16:14.570 --> 00:16:18.929
After Heyman had made an agreement with the king to destroy the Israelites, he went

00:16:18.929 --> 00:16:21.730
out and met Mordecai.

00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:27.450
And it says that Mordecai did not rise and did not tremble.

00:16:27.450 --> 00:16:33.889
The main point is that now, just as then, as with Mordecai, we don't tremble.

00:16:33.889 --> 00:16:38.889
When applying the three elements of prayer, encouragement from our brothers, and meditating

00:16:38.889 --> 00:16:43.250
on God's word, what did that produce?

00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:47.649
It helped the brothers to be calm and trust in Jehovah.

00:16:47.649 --> 00:16:56.360
Let's look at the final scripture for this talk.

00:16:56.360 --> 00:17:00.720
Please find Isaiah, chapter 30, verse 15.

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:05.640
What a beautiful verse for us to keep in mind when facing these anxious times.

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:11.680
Unfortunately, the Israelites were not willing to listen to this profound directive from

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:13.839
Jehovah.

00:17:13.839 --> 00:17:19.480
Please read it with me, Isaiah 30, 15.

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:25.619
For this is what the sovereign Lord, Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel says,

00:17:25.619 --> 00:17:31.539
By returning to me and resting, you will be saved.

00:17:31.539 --> 00:17:42.960
Your strength will be in keeping calm and showing trust, but you were unwilling.

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:45.720
What about us?

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:49.559
Will we be willing or unwilling?

00:17:49.559 --> 00:17:55.359
As we face these anxious times and even more turbulent times ahead, will we take to

00:17:55.359 --> 00:18:00.079
the heart Jehovah's admonition?

00:18:00.079 --> 00:18:05.400
Did you notice where your strengths of character and fortitude will come from?

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:11.640
It is by keeping calm and showing trust.

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:18.680
And that, brothers and sisters, is our twenty-twenty-one year text.

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:26.799
Your strength will be in keeping calm and showing trust, Isaiah 30, 15.

00:18:26.799 --> 00:18:30.400
We will face anxious times ahead.

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:37.519
By means of prayer, encouragement from each other, and leaning on God's insightful word,

00:18:37.519 --> 00:18:41.599
what can we experience during these last days?

00:18:41.599 --> 00:18:48.279
We can keep a sense of calm and fully trust in the sovereign of the universe.

00:18:48.279 --> 00:18:50.799
Our great God, Jehovah.
