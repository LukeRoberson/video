WEBVTT

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:26.190
We extend a warm welcome to one and all.

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:31.989
In this session, which corresponds to the Saturday afternoon portion of the program,

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:37.990
we will learn what we individually can do to pursue peace with others.

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:42.270
We will begin with a music video presentation.

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:48.950
The video will encourage us to welcome others into our peaceful worldwide brotherhood.

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:49.950
Please enjoy!

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:19.090
To his word and to loving truth, he offers to us all.

00:01:19.090 --> 00:02:54.460
With thankfulness of heart, we respond to his call.

00:02:54.460 --> 00:08:46.460
At the scene, far nothing vain.

00:08:46.460 --> 00:10:18.409
Please join in singing song number 29, entitled Living Up to Our Name.

00:10:19.409 --> 00:10:21.409
Song number 29.

00:10:21.409 --> 00:12:58.389
At times, our imperfections can disrupt our peace and that of others.

00:12:58.389 --> 00:13:03.389
During the next symposium, we will consider things we must avoid

00:13:03.389 --> 00:13:07.389
in order to cultivate peaceful relationships.

00:13:07.389 --> 00:13:13.389
Please give your attention to brother Harold Corcorn, a helper to the publishing committee

00:13:13.389 --> 00:13:16.389
as he develops the theme,

00:13:16.389 --> 00:13:29.070
put away peace records, inappropriate boasting.

00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:34.070
What comes to your mind when you hear the expression put away?

00:13:34.070 --> 00:13:39.070
You may think of related expressions such as cast aside,

00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:45.450
dispose of, discard, get rid of.

00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:49.450
What did we have to put away to become a Christian?

00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:55.450
The Bible in the book of Ephesians chapter 4 and verse 22 provides the answer.

00:13:55.450 --> 00:13:58.450
That's Ephesians 4, 22.

00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:06.450
You were taught to put away the all personality that conforms to your former course of conduct

00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:11.450
and that is being corrupted according to its deceptive desires.

00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:15.450
So we had to put away the all personality.

00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:20.450
But it's one thing to put it away, it's something else to keep it away.

00:14:20.450 --> 00:14:26.450
And that's why in the very next verse, verse 23 Paul encourages us to do this

00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:33.450
and you should continue to be made new in your dominant mental attitude.

00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:38.450
That's so important to keep it away because the all personality has traits

00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:42.450
that can become peace records.

00:14:43.450 --> 00:14:50.450
This symposium will consider five peace records that we should put away and keep away.

00:14:50.450 --> 00:14:54.450
Each talk will include the following main points.

00:14:54.450 --> 00:14:58.450
Number one, it will define the peace record.

00:14:58.450 --> 00:15:02.450
Number two, it will explain how it wrecks peace.

00:15:02.450 --> 00:15:07.450
And number three, we will consider how to put it away.

00:15:07.450 --> 00:15:11.450
What is the very first one we're going to talk about?

00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:15.450
It is inappropriate boasting.

00:15:15.450 --> 00:15:18.450
What is inappropriate boasting?

00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:24.450
Basically it's self-praise and the Bible condemns self-praise.

00:15:24.450 --> 00:15:27.450
Notice Proverbs chapter 27 and verse 2.

00:15:27.450 --> 00:15:35.450
Let someone else praise you and not your own mouth, others, and not your own lips.

00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:40.759
Self-praise is an evidence of pride.

00:15:40.759 --> 00:15:44.759
That causes one to elevate himself above others.

00:15:44.759 --> 00:15:51.759
Some might develop an unhealthy pride about their accomplishments, even in the ministry.

00:15:51.759 --> 00:15:54.759
It happened in the first century.

00:15:54.759 --> 00:15:59.759
Paul had to write the Corinthian congregation about the dissensions that they were having,

00:15:59.759 --> 00:16:01.759
the lack of peace they were experiencing.

00:16:01.759 --> 00:16:02.759
Why?

00:16:02.759 --> 00:16:08.759
Well, some of the congregation were popped up in pride about themselves or other men.

00:16:08.759 --> 00:16:13.759
Such as Paul, Apollos, Cephas.

00:16:13.759 --> 00:16:17.759
They were giving too much attention to themselves and to other men.

00:16:17.759 --> 00:16:22.230
Well, how could that happen today?

00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:26.230
Well, let's imagine a group of brothers talking, and one in the group says,

00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:33.230
with Jehovah's help and with diligent prayer and effort, I finally got a Bible study.

00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:37.230
But right away, another one in the group proudly declares,

00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:45.230
I have four Bible studies, two are attending meetings, and one will soon be baptized.

00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:49.480
Could such a statement be a peace record?

00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:54.480
How does inappropriate boasting wrecked peace?

00:16:54.480 --> 00:17:01.480
Well, it's not wrong to take pleasure in our work and to thank Jehovah for the success that we may have.

00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:09.480
But inappropriate boasting about our accomplishments can stir up competition, envy, and rivalry.

00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:15.480
We must remember that self-promotion does not originate with our Heavenly Father, the God of Peace.

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:17.480
Where does it originate?

00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:20.480
1 John 2 16 says,

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:25.480
The showy display of one's means of life does not originate with the Father,

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:28.480
but originates with the world.

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:33.480
And wouldn't you not agree that the world is filled with self-praise?

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:36.480
Even on their social media, we see this.

00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:43.480
Some of the material that people post on the social media is designed to make the one appear very important.

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:52.480
And it is a showy display of their accomplishments, material possessions, or their expensive vacations that they enjoy.

00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:57.480
In other words, it's all about look at me.

00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:04.480
Well, we want to avoid getting caught up in the world's spirit of self-promotion that wrecks peace.

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:12.890
To illustrate just how devastating the peace record inappropriate boasting can be,

00:18:12.890 --> 00:18:16.890
let's briefly consider the Bible character, Haiman.

00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:21.890
He was a proud and haughty man, and he boasted a lot.

00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:27.890
Esther chapter 5 tells us that he was boasting with his family and friends about his wealth, his many sons,

00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:30.890
how the king had promoted him to a high station.

00:18:30.890 --> 00:18:37.890
He was above all the other servants, and they'd had a special meal or banquet with the king and queen.

00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:47.359
But Haiman was hateful and arrogant, and he was plotting to kill Jehovah's Faithful Servant Mardekai.

00:18:47.359 --> 00:18:52.359
But his scheme and his attitudes were exposed and what happened.

00:18:52.359 --> 00:18:58.359
The very stake that Haiman had built to hang Mardekai on, he was hung on.

00:18:59.359 --> 00:19:01.359
And it reminds us, doesn't it?

00:19:01.359 --> 00:19:05.359
At Isaiah chapter 29 and verse 20, the Bible says,

00:19:05.359 --> 00:19:09.359
the bolster will come to his finish.

00:19:09.359 --> 00:19:15.359
So because of the devastating effects that improper boasting can have on ourselves and others,

00:19:15.359 --> 00:19:20.359
we do not even want to give the impression of boasting.

00:19:20.359 --> 00:19:28.359
In the following traumatization, notice how a sister's action are misunderstood as boasting.

00:19:28.359 --> 00:19:41.299
What's away from yourselves every kind of malicious bitterness, anger, wrath, screaming and abusive speech,

00:19:41.299 --> 00:19:44.299
as well as everything injurious?

00:19:44.299 --> 00:19:47.299
Did anyone start the day thinking,

00:19:47.299 --> 00:19:51.299
I believe I'll show malicious bitterness to my brother today?

00:19:52.299 --> 00:19:57.299
Of course not, and yet the potential is there, isn't it?

00:19:57.299 --> 00:20:01.299
But genuine affection, fight, peace records,

00:20:01.299 --> 00:20:07.299
and affection grows when we really know our brothers and sisters well.

00:20:07.299 --> 00:20:16.650
We remember their joys and pain, their selfless zeal,

00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:21.650
how they came to love Jehovah.

00:20:21.650 --> 00:20:24.650
And what, they endure.

00:20:24.650 --> 00:20:30.680
I'll get back it since I can.

00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:31.680
I love you. Bye.

00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:33.680
Oh no.

00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:34.680
Oh my God.

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:35.680
Oh my God.

00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:36.680
I'm all looking good to him.

00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:37.680
He'll be enough.

00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:39.680
Too sorry. Got a run.

00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:41.680
Okay, I'll ring you about this week.

00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:42.680
Thanks. Love you both.

00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:43.680
See you.

00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:44.680
Yeah, too.

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:46.680
Better.

00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:47.680
No, no.

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:49.680
Hello, Hailey Darling.

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:52.680
I'm so, so sorry.

00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:55.680
It's not too bad.

00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:58.930
I got this.

00:20:58.930 --> 00:21:00.930
Oh, how are you though?

00:21:00.930 --> 00:21:02.930
Thank you. I'm so sorry.

00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:04.930
Poor thing. Let me clear this up.

00:21:04.930 --> 00:22:14.210
Hello, everyone. Hailey from Genoa Design here,

00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:17.210
helping you to be effortlessly elegant.

00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:36.460
Can you believe how?

00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:37.460
Hailey's business feed.

00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:59.809
When you look this good.

00:22:59.809 --> 00:23:01.809
Was the sister in this video,

00:23:01.809 --> 00:23:03.809
are you posting inappropriately?

00:23:03.809 --> 00:23:04.809
No.

00:23:04.809 --> 00:23:07.809
She was a humble servant of Jehovah,

00:23:07.809 --> 00:23:11.809
kindly and patiently helping her elderly relative.

00:23:11.809 --> 00:23:14.809
But do you recall her business website

00:23:14.809 --> 00:23:18.809
and the presentation she made about her jewelry products?

00:23:18.809 --> 00:23:20.809
She said,

00:23:20.809 --> 00:23:22.809
when you look this good,

00:23:22.809 --> 00:23:25.809
you feel great.

00:23:25.809 --> 00:23:28.809
Her Christian sister was upset

00:23:28.809 --> 00:23:31.809
and she looked at those comments

00:23:31.809 --> 00:23:34.809
and her actions to be boastful.

00:23:34.809 --> 00:23:37.809
Well, this video reminds us to think about

00:23:37.809 --> 00:23:39.809
how our words and our actions

00:23:39.809 --> 00:23:41.809
may appear to others.

00:23:41.809 --> 00:23:44.809
So now we're going to get to the question,

00:23:44.809 --> 00:23:48.809
how do we put away inappropriate boasting?

00:23:48.809 --> 00:23:51.809
A key point that we must always remember

00:23:51.809 --> 00:23:53.809
to help us to do just that

00:23:53.809 --> 00:23:56.809
is recorded in the book of 1 Corinthians,

00:23:56.809 --> 00:23:58.809
chapter 4, and verse 7,

00:23:58.809 --> 00:24:01.809
1 Corinthians 4, 7.

00:24:01.809 --> 00:24:04.809
For who makes you different from another?

00:24:04.809 --> 00:24:08.809
Indeed, what do you have that you did not receive?

00:24:08.809 --> 00:24:11.809
If, in fact, you did receive it,

00:24:11.809 --> 00:24:15.809
why do you boast as though you did not receive it?

00:24:15.809 --> 00:24:17.809
What's the point of this scripture?

00:24:17.809 --> 00:24:20.809
We do not want to boast about ourselves

00:24:20.809 --> 00:24:23.809
but give all credit to Jehovah

00:24:23.809 --> 00:24:25.809
for the good that we can do.

00:24:25.809 --> 00:24:29.809
Now, some people are proud about their good looks,

00:24:29.809 --> 00:24:31.809
their popularity, their wealth,

00:24:31.809 --> 00:24:34.809
their position, their physical strength,

00:24:34.809 --> 00:24:37.809
musical ability.

00:24:37.809 --> 00:24:38.809
But remember,

00:24:38.809 --> 00:24:42.809
King David of Ancient Israel had all of those assets.

00:24:42.809 --> 00:24:44.809
But throughout his entire life,

00:24:44.809 --> 00:24:47.809
he never became a boastful person.

00:24:47.809 --> 00:24:50.809
He remained humble. Why?

00:24:50.809 --> 00:24:53.809
In Psalm 113, 5-8,

00:24:53.809 --> 00:24:57.809
David gave all credit to Jehovah.

00:24:57.809 --> 00:24:59.809
He said, in his case,

00:24:59.809 --> 00:25:02.809
Jehovah stooped down and took this lonely one

00:25:02.809 --> 00:25:06.809
and raised him up to sit with nobles.

00:25:06.809 --> 00:25:09.809
And on every occasion that he had,

00:25:09.809 --> 00:25:11.809
David would always say,

00:25:11.809 --> 00:25:12.809
praise Jehovah,

00:25:12.809 --> 00:25:16.809
boast about his holy name.

00:25:16.809 --> 00:25:18.809
Well, we like David,

00:25:18.809 --> 00:25:20.809
should boast in Jehovah.

00:25:20.809 --> 00:25:22.809
The Apostle Paul encourages to do that

00:25:22.809 --> 00:25:24.809
at 1 Corinthians 131.

00:25:24.809 --> 00:25:26.809
The one who boasts,

00:25:26.809 --> 00:25:28.809
let him boast in Jehovah.

00:25:28.809 --> 00:25:31.809
What does that mean?

00:25:31.809 --> 00:25:35.809
It means that we boast in the privilege of knowing the true God

00:25:35.809 --> 00:25:39.809
and of being able to be used by him to accomplish his will.

00:25:39.809 --> 00:25:46.369
Now, another way that we can put away in proper boasting

00:25:46.369 --> 00:25:49.369
is to not talk about ourselves

00:25:49.369 --> 00:25:51.369
but to acknowledge the good

00:25:51.369 --> 00:25:54.369
and the fine qualities that our fellow workers have.

00:25:56.619 --> 00:25:59.619
Humble and modest people don't brag about what they do,

00:25:59.619 --> 00:26:02.619
but they turn their attention to their fellow workers

00:26:02.619 --> 00:26:04.619
and see how Jehovah is using them

00:26:04.619 --> 00:26:07.619
and blessing them in his service.

00:26:07.619 --> 00:26:09.619
And when we do that,

00:26:09.619 --> 00:26:12.619
that creates a very peaceful, happy environment.

00:26:12.619 --> 00:26:18.089
Well, may we continue to put away and keep away

00:26:18.089 --> 00:26:20.089
inappropriate boasting,

00:26:20.089 --> 00:26:21.089
self-praise?

00:26:21.089 --> 00:26:22.089
How?

00:26:22.089 --> 00:26:24.089
By giving praise and thanks

00:26:24.089 --> 00:26:27.089
and honor to Jehovah for our accomplishments

00:26:27.089 --> 00:26:29.089
and by commending our fellow workers

00:26:29.089 --> 00:26:31.089
for all the good qualities they have

00:26:31.089 --> 00:26:34.089
and how Jehovah is using them in his service.

00:26:34.089 --> 00:26:36.089
By doing so,

00:26:36.089 --> 00:26:39.089
we will preserve our precious possession of peace

00:26:39.089 --> 00:26:42.089
with Jehovah and with our brothers.

00:26:42.089 --> 00:26:46.460
Brother Seth Hyatt,

00:26:46.460 --> 00:26:48.460
a helper to the service committee,

00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:51.460
will now present the next talk of this symposium,

00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:53.460
put away peace records,

00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:54.460
envy.

00:26:54.460 --> 00:27:04.329
What is envy?

00:27:04.329 --> 00:27:06.329
Do you know?

00:27:06.329 --> 00:27:08.329
It's important that we be able to identify

00:27:08.329 --> 00:27:10.329
the symptoms of envy.

00:27:10.329 --> 00:27:12.329
Why?

00:27:12.329 --> 00:27:16.329
Because envy is an expression of hatred.

00:27:16.329 --> 00:27:19.329
It's an enemy of peace.

00:27:19.329 --> 00:27:21.329
And if left unchecked,

00:27:21.329 --> 00:27:25.329
it can result in spiritual death.

00:27:25.329 --> 00:27:27.329
As described in the Bible,

00:27:27.329 --> 00:27:30.329
envy has two symptoms.

00:27:30.329 --> 00:27:33.329
The first is probably more familiar.

00:27:33.329 --> 00:27:39.329
An envious person wants what someone else has.

00:27:39.329 --> 00:27:45.329
It's the second symptom that makes envy especially dangerous.

00:27:45.329 --> 00:27:50.329
An envious person not only wants what someone else has,

00:27:50.329 --> 00:27:54.329
he doesn't want the other person to have it.

00:27:54.329 --> 00:27:56.329
Here's an example.

00:27:56.329 --> 00:27:58.329
In the first century,

00:27:58.329 --> 00:28:01.329
Jewish religious leaders envied Jesus,

00:28:01.329 --> 00:28:06.329
because Jesus was much appreciated by the common people.

00:28:06.329 --> 00:28:08.329
Jesus dealt with people,

00:28:08.329 --> 00:28:10.329
including lowly ones,

00:28:10.329 --> 00:28:12.329
in a way that dignified them.

00:28:12.329 --> 00:28:16.329
As a result, he was appreciated.

00:28:16.329 --> 00:28:19.329
The religious leaders envied him.

00:28:19.329 --> 00:28:23.329
But rather than adjusting their own way of dealing with people,

00:28:23.329 --> 00:28:27.329
they attacked Jesus verbally.

00:28:27.329 --> 00:28:31.329
In an effort to destroy his good reputation,

00:28:31.329 --> 00:28:34.329
they spread malicious slander.

00:28:34.329 --> 00:28:38.329
Not only did they want what Jesus had,

00:28:38.329 --> 00:28:41.329
they didn't want Jesus to have it.

00:28:41.329 --> 00:28:46.329
No wonder envy is listed as one of the works of the flesh in Galatians,

00:28:46.329 --> 00:28:49.329
chapter 5, verse 21.

00:28:49.329 --> 00:28:55.329
It's a dangerous quality that we need to avoid.

00:28:55.329 --> 00:29:00.670
How does envy disrupt peace?

00:29:00.670 --> 00:29:10.210
Envy undermines damages or even destroys relationships.

00:29:10.210 --> 00:29:14.210
In the family and in the congregation.

00:29:14.210 --> 00:29:21.210
Consider the example of Jacob and his 12 sons.

00:29:21.210 --> 00:29:27.210
Jacob had special affection for one of his sons, Joseph.

00:29:27.210 --> 00:29:30.210
As a result, Joseph's brothers became envious.

00:29:30.210 --> 00:29:33.210
How did the envy manifest itself?

00:29:33.210 --> 00:29:36.210
What was the fruitage?

00:29:36.210 --> 00:29:38.210
Well, they dealt treacherously with Joseph,

00:29:38.210 --> 00:29:40.210
selling him into slavery.

00:29:40.210 --> 00:29:42.210
And as if that weren't bad enough,

00:29:42.210 --> 00:29:47.210
they compounded their wrong by lying to Jacob,

00:29:47.210 --> 00:29:50.210
telling him that Joseph was dead.

00:29:50.210 --> 00:29:53.210
According to the Bible account,

00:29:53.210 --> 00:29:57.210
Jacob refused to be comforted.

00:29:57.210 --> 00:30:01.210
He mourned Joseph for years.

00:30:01.210 --> 00:30:05.210
What a terrible consequence of envy.

00:30:05.210 --> 00:30:12.210
It's clear that envy allows no room for love, compassion, or kindness.

00:30:12.210 --> 00:30:16.210
Those qualities go out the window.

00:30:16.210 --> 00:30:22.210
And they're replaced by qualities such as hatred, strife,

00:30:22.210 --> 00:30:25.940
fits of anger.

00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:29.940
Can envy disrupt the peace of a congregation?

00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:33.940
Consider the examples of Korah, Daithun, and Abairun.

00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:40.940
They envied Moses and Aaron in the congregation of Israel.

00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:44.940
How did that envy manifest itself?

00:30:44.940 --> 00:30:49.940
Well, they began to speak negatively, critically of Jehovah's representatives,

00:30:49.940 --> 00:30:56.940
even accusing Moses of playing the prince and lifting himself up above the others.

00:30:56.940 --> 00:31:05.940
They forgot that Jehovah had put Moses and Aaron in their positions of responsibility.

00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:11.940
How did Jehovah react to that manifestation of envy?

00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:16.940
He destroyed those three men and all who supported them

00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:20.940
for a time the congregation was robbed of its peace,

00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:26.940
and the account certainly provides some insight into Jehovah's view of envy.

00:31:26.940 --> 00:31:32.940
Now, by this point, you're no doubt thinking I would never want something so badly

00:31:32.940 --> 00:31:37.940
that I would damage someone else to get it.

00:31:37.940 --> 00:31:39.940
But we're all imperfect.

00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:44.940
We have a treacherous heart, and envy is insidious.

00:31:44.940 --> 00:31:56.779
In the following dramatization, notice how envy threatens to disrupt peace.

00:32:03.099 --> 00:32:15.410
Really bad news.

00:32:15.410 --> 00:32:20.579
She's a sweating.

00:32:20.579 --> 00:32:23.579
Reminds me, I want to speak to her about a necklace.

00:32:23.579 --> 00:32:24.579
You too.

00:32:24.579 --> 00:32:26.579
You don't think she's showing off?

00:32:26.579 --> 00:32:27.579
No.

00:32:27.579 --> 00:32:30.579
Everyone thinks she's mis-wonderful.

00:32:30.579 --> 00:32:32.579
She's starting to agree.

00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:40.059
Is this just about Haley?

00:32:40.059 --> 00:32:44.230
Seems it's all about Haley.

00:32:44.230 --> 00:32:48.819
Your tea's getting cold.

00:32:48.819 --> 00:32:51.819
And you're changing the subject.

00:32:51.819 --> 00:32:56.819
No, but you've brought this up before.

00:32:56.819 --> 00:33:00.809
What is it?

00:33:00.809 --> 00:33:03.809
Your friends, you pioneer together.

00:33:03.809 --> 00:33:07.809
Yeah, and that's why I'm concerned.

00:33:07.809 --> 00:33:16.809
It's only good, but is there just a little bit of envy in there?

00:33:16.809 --> 00:33:29.500
What did you notice?

00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:34.500
Well, Emily is suffering from an onset of envy.

00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:40.500
Did you notice how she questioned Haley's motives?

00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:45.500
And potentially called Haley's reputation into question.

00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:51.160
It could happen to any one of us.

00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:56.160
So how do we battle and conquer envy?

00:33:56.160 --> 00:34:00.160
By cultivating two beautiful qualities.

00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:04.160
Humility and contentment.

00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:08.159
Let's see what the Bible has to say about humility.

00:34:08.159 --> 00:34:11.159
Turn with me, please, to Philippians chapter 2.

00:34:11.159 --> 00:34:17.500
And we're going to begin reading in verse 3.

00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:20.500
Philippians chapter 2, verse 3.

00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:27.969
Do nothing out of contentiousness or out of egotism.

00:34:27.969 --> 00:34:29.969
What is egotism?

00:34:29.969 --> 00:34:34.969
Well, it's having an exaggerated opinion of oneself.

00:34:34.969 --> 00:34:39.969
Do you think that the religious leaders in Jesus' day,

00:34:39.969 --> 00:34:45.969
Joseph's brothers, Korah, Nathan, and Abiram,

00:34:45.969 --> 00:34:47.969
had this affliction?

00:34:47.969 --> 00:34:53.969
Did they have an exaggerated view of themselves without question?

00:34:53.969 --> 00:34:57.969
But it's an affliction that could affect any one of us.

00:34:57.969 --> 00:34:59.969
What is the solution?

00:34:59.969 --> 00:35:04.969
Well, Paul continues, but with humility or lowliness of mind,

00:35:04.969 --> 00:35:07.969
consider others superior to you,

00:35:07.969 --> 00:35:14.969
or consider others as more important than yourself.

00:35:14.969 --> 00:35:21.969
Now, that kind of mindset allows a person to do what stated in verse 4.

00:35:21.969 --> 00:35:25.969
As you look out not only for your own interests,

00:35:25.969 --> 00:35:30.969
but also for the interests of others.

00:35:30.969 --> 00:35:35.969
A humble person looks out for others.

00:35:35.969 --> 00:35:40.969
He doesn't feel that he deserves more than others.

00:35:40.969 --> 00:35:42.969
Contentment.

00:35:42.969 --> 00:35:45.969
A content person is satisfied with what he has.

00:35:45.969 --> 00:35:50.969
He doesn't compare his privilege or his possession

00:35:50.969 --> 00:35:54.969
with another person's privilege or possession.

00:35:54.969 --> 00:35:57.969
He's content.

00:35:57.969 --> 00:36:00.969
Humility, contentment.

00:36:00.969 --> 00:36:05.969
With Jehovah's help, we can cultivate these beautiful qualities,

00:36:05.969 --> 00:36:10.969
qualities that leave no room for envy.

00:36:10.969 --> 00:36:16.969
And in doing so, we promote peace, inner peace, peace in our family,

00:36:16.969 --> 00:36:19.969
and peace in the congregation.

00:36:19.969 --> 00:36:25.969
And you can be sure that Jehovah appreciates that.

00:36:25.969 --> 00:36:29.969
Brother Gaius Glockentine, a helper to the publishing committee,

00:36:29.969 --> 00:36:33.969
will now present the next talk of this symposium.

00:36:33.969 --> 00:36:37.969
Put away peace records, dishonesty.

00:36:37.969 --> 00:36:49.650
What comes to your mind when you hear the word dishonesty?

00:36:49.650 --> 00:36:53.650
Maybe you think of Satan the father of the lie,

00:36:53.650 --> 00:36:56.650
or an aniahs in his wife comes to your mind.

00:36:56.650 --> 00:37:00.650
They lost their lives because of lying.

00:37:00.650 --> 00:37:03.650
We do not want to imitate such ones.

00:37:03.650 --> 00:37:06.650
We avoid lying.

00:37:06.650 --> 00:37:12.650
Is that, though, as far as our honesty goes?

00:37:12.650 --> 00:37:16.650
Our holy God, Jehovah, wants us to be holy as well.

00:37:16.650 --> 00:37:21.650
That is why He urged the ancient Israelites not to deceive others,

00:37:21.650 --> 00:37:26.650
as mentioned in Leviticus 19, verse 11.

00:37:26.650 --> 00:37:32.650
Does this not add some color to honesty?

00:37:32.650 --> 00:37:37.650
This honesty includes, and please take note of this definition,

00:37:37.650 --> 00:37:42.650
intentionally leading someone to a wrong conclusion.

00:37:42.650 --> 00:37:45.650
For example, by twisting the truth,

00:37:45.650 --> 00:37:48.650
or by providing only certain details,

00:37:48.650 --> 00:37:51.650
we endanger our peace with others.

00:37:51.650 --> 00:37:53.650
Why can we say so?

00:37:53.650 --> 00:37:58.650
How does this honesty wreck peace?

00:37:58.650 --> 00:38:03.650
Peace and a peaceful relationship are built on trust.

00:38:03.650 --> 00:38:08.650
Trusting someone makes you feel safe and secure.

00:38:08.650 --> 00:38:11.650
Put you at ease.

00:38:11.650 --> 00:38:15.650
There is no peace without trust.

00:38:15.650 --> 00:38:18.650
How do we develop trust?

00:38:18.650 --> 00:38:22.650
Trust is the result of spending time together,

00:38:22.650 --> 00:38:24.650
speaking the truth with one another.

00:38:24.650 --> 00:38:27.650
We trust people that act unselfishly

00:38:27.650 --> 00:38:32.650
and do not use crooked speech as the Bible puts it.

00:38:32.650 --> 00:38:37.650
If someone deceived us only once or was dishonest in another way,

00:38:37.650 --> 00:38:41.650
we might start to question everything they say.

00:38:41.650 --> 00:38:44.650
One single act of dishonesty may be enough.

00:38:44.650 --> 00:38:47.650
It can ruin their reputation.

00:38:47.650 --> 00:38:50.960
As bad as this is,

00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:55.960
this honesty has the potential to create even greater damage.

00:38:55.960 --> 00:39:01.960
This honesty can be compared with a highly contagious virus.

00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:06.960
This honesty breeds this honesty.

00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:10.960
People who have contact with deceitful dishonest person

00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:13.960
are in danger of being infected.

00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:18.960
This honesty might not only wreck one relationship,

00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:20.960
but multiple relationships,

00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:27.619
putting the unity and peace of the whole group at risk.

00:39:27.619 --> 00:39:32.619
This reminds us of the relationship between Laban and Jacob

00:39:32.619 --> 00:39:34.619
and the Bible book of Genesis.

00:39:34.619 --> 00:39:37.619
Based on the agreement with Laban,

00:39:37.619 --> 00:39:40.619
Jacob worked hard for seven years

00:39:40.619 --> 00:39:43.619
in order to marry Laban's daughter Rachel.

00:39:43.619 --> 00:39:46.619
And despite this high price,

00:39:46.619 --> 00:39:48.619
that Jacob had to pay,

00:39:48.619 --> 00:39:55.619
those years seemed for him just like a few days.

00:39:55.619 --> 00:39:57.619
Sadly, instead of Rachel,

00:39:57.619 --> 00:40:01.619
he received the older daughter Leah as wife.

00:40:01.619 --> 00:40:05.619
So now, Leah was also part of the deception.

00:40:05.619 --> 00:40:09.969
What was the result after Jacob had found out

00:40:09.969 --> 00:40:11.969
that Laban tricked him?

00:40:11.969 --> 00:40:13.969
The trust was gone.

00:40:13.969 --> 00:40:16.969
The relationship had suffered to a great degree.

00:40:17.969 --> 00:40:21.969
This honesty wrecked the peace in those relationships.

00:40:21.969 --> 00:40:27.969
And so the following seven years of work for Rachel were bitter.

00:40:27.969 --> 00:40:32.969
And Laban's dishonesty emboldened him to continue in his course.

00:40:32.969 --> 00:40:36.969
He unfairly jained Jacob's rages ten times.

00:40:36.969 --> 00:40:39.969
He deceived Jacob.

00:40:39.969 --> 00:40:42.969
Because of Laban's dishonesty,

00:40:42.969 --> 00:40:45.969
the peace and the whole family was disrupted.

00:40:45.969 --> 00:40:52.920
Let us now continue to watch the next segment of the dramatization.

00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:56.920
We left Emily and Celia sitting in a coffee shop.

00:40:56.920 --> 00:41:00.920
Please watch carefully and notice how Emily is tempted

00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:02.920
to alter the truth.

00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:09.110
I am concerned.

00:41:09.110 --> 00:41:11.110
Concern is good.

00:41:11.110 --> 00:41:16.110
But is there just a little bit of Emily in there?

00:41:16.110 --> 00:41:21.219
I thought you would understand.

00:41:21.219 --> 00:41:25.760
I think I understand your feelings.

00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:27.760
Not about Hailey.

00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:30.760
I haven't seen all her posts.

00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:33.760
There's nothing immoral is there.

00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:35.760
No.

00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:36.760
Good.

00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:38.760
That's not like her.

00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:43.760
Now, if it's the case of her being not careful,

00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:46.760
how she comes across, that's another matter.

00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:49.760
Why don't you talk to her?

00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:55.619
Maybe.

00:41:55.619 --> 00:42:03.619
Emily, you are a beautiful spiritual sister.

00:42:03.619 --> 00:42:08.219
You know, for years,

00:42:08.219 --> 00:42:15.300
I had a bad habit comparing myself to others.

00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:22.300
My own insecurity hurt me and my closest friends.

00:42:22.300 --> 00:42:36.570
So you don't think I should have spoken to Celia?

00:42:36.570 --> 00:42:39.570
Oh, I'm glad you've asked Celia about it.

00:42:39.570 --> 00:42:41.570
Tell me when you trust.

00:42:41.570 --> 00:42:45.170
What did she say?

00:42:45.170 --> 00:42:48.170
She definitely understands how I feel.

00:42:48.170 --> 00:42:49.170
Good.

00:42:49.170 --> 00:42:54.179
How about Hailey's posts?

00:42:54.179 --> 00:42:58.179
She hasn't seen everything she has out there.

00:42:58.179 --> 00:43:01.179
Hmm.

00:43:01.179 --> 00:43:06.179
She did say that Haley needs to be more careful

00:43:07.179 --> 00:43:09.179
how she comes across.

00:43:09.179 --> 00:43:15.159
What did she suggest?

00:43:15.159 --> 00:43:19.159
I should tell her that she needs to stop,

00:43:19.159 --> 00:43:25.579
but I'm too worked up.

00:43:25.579 --> 00:43:34.730
Look, if Celia agrees that Haley's doing something she shouldn't,

00:43:34.730 --> 00:43:40.920
you should talk to her.

00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:51.619
You'll find her at a time.

00:43:51.619 --> 00:43:52.619
Thanks for understanding.

00:43:52.619 --> 00:43:55.320
I'm hungry.

00:43:55.320 --> 00:43:57.320
Can you say the prayer?

00:43:57.320 --> 00:44:00.690
Sure.

00:44:00.690 --> 00:44:12.019
Jehovah, we would like to praise you for your generosity and kindness.

00:44:12.019 --> 00:44:16.019
Did you notice how Emily just heard what you wanted to hear?

00:44:16.019 --> 00:44:21.019
In talking to her husband, Jake, she painted an incomplete picture.

00:44:21.019 --> 00:44:27.019
She did not relate that Celia had no opinion about the social media posts of Haley.

00:44:27.019 --> 00:44:30.019
And contrary to what she told her husband,

00:44:30.019 --> 00:44:35.019
Celia did not encourage her to tell Haley to stop.

00:44:35.019 --> 00:44:38.019
Our brothers and sisters deserve the truth.

00:44:38.019 --> 00:44:41.019
But Emily didn't relate that, did she?

00:44:41.019 --> 00:44:48.019
She was dishonest, something that can have a damaging effect as we will see later.

00:44:48.019 --> 00:44:54.019
Jehovah wants us to put away this peace record, this honesty.

00:44:54.019 --> 00:44:59.019
He wants us to always be truthful, even in small matters.

00:44:59.019 --> 00:45:04.019
Therefore, how do we put away this honesty?

00:45:05.019 --> 00:45:09.019
Let us please turn to Ephesians chapter 4.

00:45:09.019 --> 00:45:14.019
Here, the Apostle Paul reminds us of a reason to be honest.

00:45:14.019 --> 00:45:20.019
This is Ephesians chapter 4, and we want to read verse 25.

00:45:20.019 --> 00:45:25.300
Therefore, now that you have put away this seed,

00:45:25.300 --> 00:45:34.300
each one of you speak truth with his neighbor because we are members belonging to one another.

00:45:35.300 --> 00:45:41.300
Did you notice why we put away this seed and speak truth with one another?

00:45:41.300 --> 00:45:46.300
Paul says, because we are members belonging to one another,

00:45:46.300 --> 00:45:52.300
in other words, Paul reminds us of the fact that this honesty affects others,

00:45:52.300 --> 00:45:55.300
our brothers, our relationship with them.

00:45:55.300 --> 00:46:01.300
So then, knowing this, how can we put away this honesty?

00:46:01.300 --> 00:46:08.300
The answer is by considering the consequences of this honesty and honesty.

00:46:08.300 --> 00:46:12.300
This will help us to do the right thing.

00:46:12.300 --> 00:46:16.300
Now, what are the consequences of dishonesty?

00:46:16.300 --> 00:46:20.300
As we have seen in the case of Laban and Jacob,

00:46:20.300 --> 00:46:24.300
it will disrupt the peace with others.

00:46:24.300 --> 00:46:27.300
And since Jehovah hates this honesty,

00:46:27.300 --> 00:46:32.900
it will also disrupt our peace with Jehovah.

00:46:32.900 --> 00:46:38.900
On the other hand, what are the consequences of honesty?

00:46:38.900 --> 00:46:42.900
While this honesty might seem in the moment to be the easier way out,

00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:48.900
in the long run, honest people enable us to have good friends.

00:46:48.900 --> 00:46:50.900
They want to enjoy peace as well,

00:46:50.900 --> 00:46:56.900
and therefore they are also searching for someone they can trust.

00:46:56.900 --> 00:47:03.900
In this way, we are like body members belonging to one another.

00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:09.900
And even more importantly, we will enjoy a good conscience.

00:47:09.900 --> 00:47:12.900
Peace with God.

00:47:12.900 --> 00:47:18.900
Let us therefore put away this peace record dishonesty by sticking to the truth,

00:47:18.900 --> 00:47:20.900
even in small things.

00:47:20.900 --> 00:47:25.900
Dear brothers and sisters, Jehovah knows that for us imperfect humans,

00:47:25.900 --> 00:47:28.900
this is not always easy.

00:47:28.900 --> 00:47:37.900
Yet he promises to help us and to bless every step we take to build trust and peace

00:47:37.900 --> 00:47:41.900
and not to wreck it.

00:47:41.900 --> 00:47:45.900
Brother Patrick LaFranca, a helper to the personnel committee,

00:47:45.900 --> 00:47:48.900
will now present the next talk of this symposium,

00:47:48.900 --> 00:48:01.199
put away peace records, harmful gossip.

00:48:01.199 --> 00:48:07.199
Do you gossip? No? Well, whenever we share any news about others,

00:48:07.199 --> 00:48:09.199
that is a form of gossip.

00:48:09.199 --> 00:48:11.199
Because we are interested in others,

00:48:11.199 --> 00:48:15.199
we might say, I am really concerned about Brother Smith's health.

00:48:15.199 --> 00:48:20.199
Or did you hear about Sister Brown's experience in the ministry?

00:48:20.199 --> 00:48:24.199
Is this type of gossip harmful? Generally not.

00:48:24.199 --> 00:48:26.199
Still, we need to be careful.

00:48:26.199 --> 00:48:31.199
At 1 Timothy 513, Paul spoke out against certain sisters,

00:48:31.199 --> 00:48:36.199
who were gossipers and medallers in other people's affairs.

00:48:36.199 --> 00:48:41.199
We do not need to know and share everything we know about what's happening

00:48:41.199 --> 00:48:43.199
in other people's lives.

00:48:43.199 --> 00:48:48.199
What if, for example, Brother Smith did not want others to know details

00:48:48.199 --> 00:48:50.199
about his health problem?

00:48:50.199 --> 00:48:53.199
We need to respect the privacy of others.

00:48:53.199 --> 00:48:58.199
Or what if talking about Sister Brown's experience turns into,

00:48:58.199 --> 00:49:02.199
oh, you know, she always brags about her success in the ministry?

00:49:02.199 --> 00:49:06.199
When I talk about others, turns negative.

00:49:06.199 --> 00:49:08.199
It can develop into slander.

00:49:08.199 --> 00:49:12.199
Slander is making deliberate fault statements that damage

00:49:12.199 --> 00:49:15.199
another's reputation.

00:49:15.199 --> 00:49:20.199
Let's now consider how harmful gossip wrecks peace.

00:49:20.199 --> 00:49:24.199
If you have spread harmful gossip about someone,

00:49:24.199 --> 00:49:26.199
and he hears about it,

00:49:26.199 --> 00:49:28.199
when you see him the next time,

00:49:28.199 --> 00:49:31.199
what will be the look on his face?

00:49:31.199 --> 00:49:37.199
Please read with me Proverbs 25-23.

00:49:37.199 --> 00:49:41.199
The North Wind brings a downpour,

00:49:41.199 --> 00:49:46.199
and a gossiping tongue brings an angry face.

00:49:46.199 --> 00:49:52.199
The North Wind in Palestine brought dark clouds and rain.

00:49:52.199 --> 00:49:57.199
Likewise, when the one you gossiped about catches wind of this,

00:49:57.199 --> 00:49:59.199
and he sees you,

00:49:59.199 --> 00:50:02.199
he will have a gloomy, angry face.

00:50:02.199 --> 00:50:07.199
There will be a storm and a chilled relationship.

00:50:07.199 --> 00:50:09.199
Now, when that happens,

00:50:09.199 --> 00:50:13.199
you may feel very badly and apologize,

00:50:13.199 --> 00:50:16.199
but you may have damaged his reputation

00:50:16.199 --> 00:50:20.199
in a way that may be difficult to undo.

00:50:20.199 --> 00:50:24.199
Listen to this old Jewish story.

00:50:24.199 --> 00:50:26.199
A man went about town,

00:50:26.199 --> 00:50:29.199
slandering the town's wise man.

00:50:29.199 --> 00:50:32.199
Later, the malicious gossiper realized his wrong

00:50:32.199 --> 00:50:36.199
and went to the wise man and asked for his forgiveness.

00:50:36.199 --> 00:50:40.199
He offered to do whatever was needed to make a man's.

00:50:40.199 --> 00:50:43.199
The wise man made one request.

00:50:43.199 --> 00:50:48.199
He told the gossiper to take a feather pillow, cut it open,

00:50:48.199 --> 00:50:51.199
and scatter the feathers to the wind.

00:50:51.199 --> 00:50:54.199
The gossiper was puzzled by this request,

00:50:54.199 --> 00:50:56.199
but he did as instructed.

00:50:56.199 --> 00:50:59.199
Then he returned to the wise man.

00:50:59.199 --> 00:51:01.199
Am I now forgiven, he asked?

00:51:01.199 --> 00:51:05.199
First, go and gather all the feathers.

00:51:05.199 --> 00:51:07.199
The wise man responded,

00:51:07.199 --> 00:51:08.199
but how can I?

00:51:08.199 --> 00:51:11.199
The wind has already scattered them.

00:51:11.199 --> 00:51:13.199
The wise man replied,

00:51:13.199 --> 00:51:18.199
it is as difficult to repair the damage done by your words

00:51:18.199 --> 00:51:21.199
as it is to recover the feathers.

00:51:21.199 --> 00:51:24.199
Yes, once spoken,

00:51:24.199 --> 00:51:27.199
hurtful words cannot be retrieved.

00:51:27.199 --> 00:51:31.199
Let's not scatter feathers in the wind.

00:51:31.199 --> 00:51:33.199
If we spread rumors,

00:51:33.199 --> 00:51:38.199
it can seriously disturb the peace of many in the congregation.

00:51:38.199 --> 00:51:44.199
We find an example of this at Acts 21 verses 20 and 21.

00:51:44.199 --> 00:51:49.199
The older men of the Jerusalem congregation explained to Paul

00:51:49.199 --> 00:51:53.199
that some Jews had spread a rumor among Jewish Christians

00:51:53.199 --> 00:51:56.199
that he had been teaching an apostasy,

00:51:56.199 --> 00:51:59.199
speaking against the law of Moses.

00:51:59.199 --> 00:52:03.199
Of course, this was a twisting of the facts.

00:52:03.199 --> 00:52:06.199
Paul never spoke disrespectfully of the law.

00:52:06.199 --> 00:52:08.199
He even went to synagogues

00:52:08.199 --> 00:52:12.199
where he reasoned on the basis of the Hebrew scriptures.

00:52:12.199 --> 00:52:17.199
Such stories could have led some newly converted Jewish Christians

00:52:17.199 --> 00:52:21.199
to think that Paul did not respect God's arrangements,

00:52:21.199 --> 00:52:25.199
and this could have seriously disrupted the peace of the congregation.

00:52:25.199 --> 00:52:28.199
In the following dramatization,

00:52:28.199 --> 00:52:31.199
notice the effect that harmful gossip

00:52:31.199 --> 00:52:34.199
can have on the peace in a congregation.

00:52:34.199 --> 00:52:37.480
Can you believe that?

00:52:37.480 --> 00:52:39.480
Especially as a pioneer.

00:52:39.480 --> 00:52:42.480
What kind of example is she setting?

00:52:42.480 --> 00:52:44.480
Has Emily stopped following her?

00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:46.480
No, not yet, but she probably will.

00:52:46.480 --> 00:52:48.480
Alistair, what do you think?

00:52:48.480 --> 00:52:50.480
About what?

00:52:50.480 --> 00:52:53.480
Haley's posts on Quickpost.

00:52:53.480 --> 00:52:55.480
Is there a problem?

00:52:56.480 --> 00:52:58.480
Emily's told me.

00:52:58.480 --> 00:53:00.480
They're all just look at me,

00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:03.480
my clothes, my hair, my makeup,

00:53:03.480 --> 00:53:07.480
and even senior agrees with her.

00:53:07.480 --> 00:53:13.480
Well, it's very easy to take things out of context on social media.

00:53:13.480 --> 00:53:16.480
I know that I've done that

00:53:16.480 --> 00:53:20.480
and realize later that I was wrong.

00:53:20.480 --> 00:53:23.480
Yeah, that's a good point.

00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:27.480
Listen, I don't want to pull you away,

00:53:27.480 --> 00:53:29.480
but if you have a minute,

00:53:29.480 --> 00:53:31.480
would you mind giving me a hand with these boxes?

00:53:31.480 --> 00:53:42.369
Sure.

00:53:42.369 --> 00:53:43.369
Thanks for your help.

00:53:43.369 --> 00:53:44.369
No problem.

00:53:44.369 --> 00:53:46.369
Jake, back in the hall,

00:53:46.369 --> 00:53:49.369
I know you were just expressing concern,

00:53:49.369 --> 00:53:52.369
but here's something to consider.

00:53:52.369 --> 00:53:56.369
This principle is one of my favourites.

00:53:56.369 --> 00:54:02.369
It's found in Proverbs chapter 18 and verse 17.

00:54:02.369 --> 00:54:07.000
The first to state his case seems right

00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:11.000
until the other party comes and cross-examines it.

00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:17.639
Let me try and understand.

00:54:17.639 --> 00:54:20.639
It just means that sometimes

00:54:20.639 --> 00:54:24.639
we only hear one side of a story.

00:54:24.639 --> 00:54:27.639
And until we personally hear both,

00:54:27.639 --> 00:54:30.639
it's best not to draw any conclusions.

00:54:30.639 --> 00:54:32.639
And even then,

00:54:32.639 --> 00:54:35.639
if it's something negative,

00:54:35.639 --> 00:54:37.639
we wouldn't want to spread it.

00:54:37.639 --> 00:54:40.639
Any more than we want something spread about ourselves.

00:54:40.639 --> 00:54:46.670
I'm going to consider that.

00:54:46.670 --> 00:54:47.670
Thanks.

00:54:47.670 --> 00:54:54.579
I'm going to apologise to Harry and Marie

00:54:54.579 --> 00:54:57.579
and have Emily talk directly to Haley.

00:54:57.579 --> 00:55:07.219
Good idea.

00:55:07.219 --> 00:55:09.219
Did you notice what Jake said

00:55:09.219 --> 00:55:12.219
after the elder graciously helped him reason

00:55:12.219 --> 00:55:15.219
on Proverbs 18, 17?

00:55:15.219 --> 00:55:16.219
He said,

00:55:16.219 --> 00:55:18.219
I had not considered that.

00:55:18.219 --> 00:55:20.219
Yes.

00:55:20.219 --> 00:55:23.219
Jake just did not stop and think

00:55:23.219 --> 00:55:27.219
before he said those negative things about Haley.

00:55:27.219 --> 00:55:30.219
So how can we put away harmful gossip

00:55:30.219 --> 00:55:32.219
before it begins?

00:55:32.219 --> 00:55:39.400
Let's read Proverbs 15, 28.

00:55:39.400 --> 00:55:41.400
The heart of the righteous one

00:55:41.400 --> 00:55:43.400
meditates before answering.

00:55:43.400 --> 00:55:45.400
But the mouth of the wicked

00:55:45.400 --> 00:55:49.400
blurs out bad things.

00:55:49.400 --> 00:55:52.400
So before we say bad things about others,

00:55:52.400 --> 00:55:55.400
we need to meditate.

00:55:55.400 --> 00:55:58.400
This does not mean a long drawn out process.

00:55:58.400 --> 00:56:01.400
It just requires a little thought.

00:56:01.400 --> 00:56:04.400
What thoughts could have stopped Jake

00:56:04.400 --> 00:56:07.400
from repeating his wife's negative view

00:56:07.400 --> 00:56:10.400
of Haley's post?

00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:12.400
He could have asked himself,

00:56:12.400 --> 00:56:15.400
is what I am about to say true?

00:56:15.400 --> 00:56:18.400
Is it kind, loving?

00:56:18.400 --> 00:56:20.400
How will Harry and Marie

00:56:20.400 --> 00:56:22.400
view Haley

00:56:22.400 --> 00:56:26.400
if they hear those negative things about her?

00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:28.400
Another principle that will help us

00:56:28.400 --> 00:56:30.400
to put away harmful gossip

00:56:30.400 --> 00:56:33.400
is the so-called Golden Rule

00:56:33.400 --> 00:56:36.400
as recorded at Luke 631.

00:56:36.400 --> 00:56:37.400
Jesus said,

00:56:37.400 --> 00:56:40.400
just as you want men to do to you

00:56:40.400 --> 00:56:43.400
do the same to them.

00:56:43.400 --> 00:56:46.400
This means showing empathy,

00:56:46.400 --> 00:56:49.400
putting ourselves in the place of the other person,

00:56:49.400 --> 00:56:50.400
asking ourselves,

00:56:50.400 --> 00:56:52.400
how would I feel

00:56:52.400 --> 00:56:56.710
if someone said this about me?

00:56:56.710 --> 00:56:58.710
One situation that may tempt us

00:56:58.710 --> 00:57:01.710
to engage in harmful gossip

00:57:01.710 --> 00:57:05.710
is when we believe we have been wronged by someone.

00:57:05.710 --> 00:57:07.710
Instead of applying the counsel

00:57:07.710 --> 00:57:10.710
at Matthew 5.23 and 24

00:57:10.710 --> 00:57:12.710
and chapter 18 verse 15

00:57:12.710 --> 00:57:15.710
to talk to the person privately,

00:57:15.710 --> 00:57:17.710
let's start talking about it to others

00:57:17.710 --> 00:57:19.710
who are not involved.

00:57:19.710 --> 00:57:23.710
Imagine if after finally talking with the person

00:57:23.710 --> 00:57:27.710
you find out he actually did not wrong you at all.

00:57:27.710 --> 00:57:31.710
You have made the situation much worse.

00:57:31.710 --> 00:57:33.710
But whether we are right or wrong,

00:57:33.710 --> 00:57:36.710
engaging in hurtful speech

00:57:36.710 --> 00:57:41.440
will never improve a situation.

00:57:41.440 --> 00:57:44.440
Gossip requires a speaker

00:57:44.440 --> 00:57:46.440
and a listener.

00:57:46.440 --> 00:57:50.440
Is it wrong to listen to harmful gossip?

00:57:50.440 --> 00:57:51.440
Yes.

00:57:51.440 --> 00:57:55.440
Note what Proverbs 174 says.

00:57:55.440 --> 00:57:58.440
A wicked man pays attention

00:57:58.440 --> 00:58:00.440
to hurtful speech

00:58:00.440 --> 00:58:02.440
and a deceptive man

00:58:02.440 --> 00:58:05.440
listens to a malicious tongue.

00:58:05.440 --> 00:58:07.440
Think about that.

00:58:07.440 --> 00:58:09.440
In God's eyes,

00:58:09.440 --> 00:58:12.440
if we listen to hurtful, malicious speech,

00:58:12.440 --> 00:58:15.440
we too bear a heavy responsibility

00:58:15.440 --> 00:58:17.440
by listening to the gossiper,

00:58:17.440 --> 00:58:20.440
we are encouraging him to go on.

00:58:20.440 --> 00:58:23.440
So what should you do?

00:58:23.440 --> 00:58:26.440
Without taking on an air of self-righteousness,

00:58:26.440 --> 00:58:28.440
you could simply say,

00:58:28.440 --> 00:58:31.440
let's change the subject.

00:58:31.440 --> 00:58:35.440
Or I don't really feel comfortable talking about this.

00:58:35.440 --> 00:58:40.440
After all, she is not here to defend herself.

00:58:40.440 --> 00:58:44.440
And if we find that her brother or sister likes to gossip,

00:58:44.440 --> 00:58:48.440
we may find it easier to avoid harmful gossip

00:58:48.440 --> 00:58:53.440
by stopping close association with that person.

00:58:53.440 --> 00:58:56.440
Proverbs 20 verse 19,

00:58:56.440 --> 00:58:59.440
frankly, councils do not associate

00:58:59.440 --> 00:59:03.440
with one who loves to gossip.

00:59:03.440 --> 00:59:05.440
So dear friends,

00:59:05.440 --> 00:59:08.440
let's put away harmful gossip

00:59:08.440 --> 00:59:13.440
doing so we will maintain our precious peace and unity.

00:59:14.440 --> 00:59:18.440
Brother Kenneth Cook, a member of the governing body,

00:59:18.440 --> 00:59:22.440
will now present the final talk of this symposium,

00:59:22.440 --> 00:59:24.440
put away peace records,

00:59:24.440 --> 00:59:34.960
uncontrolled anger.

00:59:34.960 --> 00:59:37.960
Satan is the main peace record.

00:59:37.960 --> 00:59:41.960
The scriptures tell us that he is driven by great anger.

00:59:41.960 --> 00:59:45.960
His anger is malicious and uncontrolled.

00:59:45.960 --> 00:59:48.960
Would any sound-minded God-fearing person

00:59:48.960 --> 00:59:52.960
allow himself to reflect Satan's vicious anger?

00:59:52.960 --> 00:59:54.960
Of course not.

00:59:54.960 --> 00:59:57.960
That is why all true servants of God are determined

00:59:57.960 --> 01:00:00.960
to put away uncontrolled anger.

01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:03.960
But apart from uncontrolled anger,

01:00:03.960 --> 01:00:05.960
is all anger bad?

01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:08.960
The Bible does not condemn all anger.

01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:12.960
It teaches us that anger is wrong when it is uncontrolled

01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:14.960
or unjustified.

01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:18.960
In Ephesians 426, God's Word tells us to be wrathful,

01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:21.960
but it adds do not sin.

01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:24.960
At times, anger may simply be a strong feeling

01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:28.960
that comes into us because of being upset or annoyed

01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:31.960
by something that we see as being wrong.

01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:34.960
That in itself is not bad.

01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:39.960
But what makes anger bad is when it fills a person's heart.

01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:42.960
And here she just loses control of it.

01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:43.960
That happens.

01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:48.960
It may cause a person to act without a sound mind.

01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:50.960
Those who continue to lash out in anger

01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:53.960
will not gain salvation.

01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:57.960
Galatians 520 lists fits of anger among the works of the flesh

01:00:57.960 --> 01:01:02.960
that will prevent a person from inheriting God's kingdom.

01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:06.960
There will be no place for such ones in God's new world.

01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:09.960
A brief review of how uncontrolled anger wrecks peace

01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:14.960
for ourselves and others will highlight why this is so.

01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:18.960
Uncontrolled anger harms both the angry person

01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:20.960
as well as those around him.

01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:23.960
We read at Proverbs 29-22

01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:26.960
that an angry person stirs up strife

01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:30.960
adding that he commits many transgressions.

01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:34.960
One of these many sins is abusive speech.

01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:38.960
We must work to show restraint when speaking with workmates,

01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:40.960
with strangers in the ministry,

01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:44.960
with our brothers and sisters in the congregation,

01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:46.960
and with our family members.

01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:49.960
Bad feelings must be controlled.

01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:55.960
Abusive speech, ridicule, contempt, and hateful anger are wrong.

01:01:55.960 --> 01:01:59.960
Giving vent to such feelings can destroy precious friendships

01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:03.960
with other people and with Jehovah.

01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:05.960
Don't be like a volcano.

01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:07.960
That will not quiet down.

01:02:07.960 --> 01:02:10.960
Just like an erupting volcano

01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:12.960
will harm those living around it.

01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:15.960
So too a person who expresses intense anger

01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:18.960
will harm those living around him.

01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:23.960
He also damages himself in what way?

01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:28.960
Acting on anger often leads to even more aggression.

01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:32.960
So then uncontrolled anger can also affect our own peace.

01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:36.960
It can cause us to do something that we will later regret.

01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:39.960
It can have a negative effect on our health.

01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:43.960
Medical studies show that uncontrolled anger can cause

01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:46.960
high blood pressure and respiratory problems.

01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:49.960
It can also affect the liver and pancreas.

01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:53.960
And such anger can cause digestive problems.

01:02:53.960 --> 01:02:55.960
When a person becomes angry,

01:02:55.960 --> 01:02:58.960
he or she will not always think clearly.

01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:03.960
After a fit of rage, a person may become depressed.

01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:07.960
No wonder we read at Proverbs 14 and verse 30

01:03:07.960 --> 01:03:12.960
that a calm heart gives life to the body.

01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:15.960
The disastrous consequences of uncontrolled anger

01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:20.960
are illustrated in God's word by the actions of Simeon

01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:24.960
and Levi, sons of the patriarch Jacob.

01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:27.960
When they learned that their sister Dino was violated

01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:29.960
by a man named Shikam,

01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:32.960
we read a Genesis 34 and verse 7

01:03:32.960 --> 01:03:36.960
that they were offended and very angry.

01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:38.960
Now they had a valid reason to be angry,

01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:41.960
but they took their anger too far.

01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:43.960
It was uncontrolled.

01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:46.960
Simeon and Levi took vengeance on Shikam.

01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:48.960
Using deception,

01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:53.960
they attacked and killed every male in Shikam city.

01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:56.960
Then, along with the other sons of Jacob,

01:03:56.960 --> 01:03:58.960
they plundered it and took the women

01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:01.960
and little children captive.

01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:06.960
Dino's tragic experience must have grieved Jacob greatly,

01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:11.960
yet he condemned his son's uncontrolled anger.

01:04:11.960 --> 01:04:14.960
Simeon and Levi tried to justify their actions,

01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:16.960
but that was not the end of the matter

01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:20.960
because Jehovah was also displeased.

01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:23.960
For this reason, Jacob later foretold

01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:26.960
that the descendants of Simeon and Levi

01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:30.960
were to be scattered among the tribes of Israel.

01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:34.960
Their uncontrolled anger brought disfavor from God

01:04:34.960 --> 01:04:37.960
and from their father, Jacob.

01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:41.960
We're wise to pay attention to such scriptural accounts

01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:44.960
and put away uncontrolled anger

01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:47.960
and all of the harm that it brings.

01:04:47.960 --> 01:04:49.960
In the following dramatization,

01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:52.960
notice how a person might be tempted

01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:54.960
to give in to anger.

01:04:54.960 --> 01:05:04.440
Yes, Nana?

01:05:04.440 --> 01:05:05.440
Don't forget eggs.

01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:07.440
No, no, I didn't forget.

01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:08.440
Are you sure?

01:05:08.440 --> 01:05:09.440
No, I won't forget.

01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:10.440
Okay.

01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:11.440
Okay, love you.

01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:28.090
Bye.

01:05:28.090 --> 01:05:29.090
Finally, I've caught you.

01:05:29.090 --> 01:05:30.090
Do you have a minute?

01:05:30.090 --> 01:05:31.090
Oh, hi Emily.

01:05:31.090 --> 01:05:33.090
Can we talk later?

01:05:33.090 --> 01:05:35.090
I'm really struggling this morning.

01:05:35.090 --> 01:05:37.090
Dino, it's just, you've been so busy

01:05:37.090 --> 01:05:39.090
and I've been waiting for the right moment.

01:05:39.090 --> 01:05:42.090
I really just like to address it.

01:05:42.090 --> 01:05:45.090
Okay, what's up?

01:05:45.090 --> 01:05:46.090
It's just that I've noticed

01:05:46.090 --> 01:05:50.090
you were post-lately on quick posts.

01:05:50.090 --> 01:05:51.090
What about them?

01:05:51.090 --> 01:05:53.090
Well, do you really think

01:05:53.090 --> 01:05:56.090
there's something that a pioneer should be posting?

01:05:56.090 --> 01:05:58.090
What are you talking about?

01:05:58.090 --> 01:06:01.090
Some people might think you're bragging.

01:06:01.090 --> 01:06:03.090
Some people.

01:06:03.090 --> 01:06:04.090
What people?

01:06:04.090 --> 01:06:05.090
It's a business account.

01:06:05.090 --> 01:06:06.090
I've got to show off my product.

01:06:06.090 --> 01:06:07.090
I know, I get that.

01:06:07.090 --> 01:06:08.090
I don't know.

01:06:08.090 --> 01:06:09.090
It could feel like you're drawing

01:06:09.090 --> 01:06:11.090
a little too much attention to yourself.

01:06:11.090 --> 01:06:12.090
Who would think like that?

01:06:12.090 --> 01:06:13.090
You.

01:06:13.090 --> 01:06:14.090
No.

01:06:14.090 --> 01:06:15.090
Not just me.

01:06:15.090 --> 01:06:16.090
Celia felt the same.

01:06:16.090 --> 01:06:18.090
You spoke to Celia about this.

01:06:18.090 --> 01:06:21.429
I didn't want to upset you.

01:06:21.429 --> 01:06:22.429
Jake said that I needed to take.

01:06:22.429 --> 01:06:24.429
Jake said everyone.

01:06:24.429 --> 01:06:26.429
I think it's my poster in a prove.

01:06:26.429 --> 01:06:28.429
Not everyone, Hailey.

01:06:28.429 --> 01:06:30.429
That's not what I'm saying at all.

01:06:30.429 --> 01:06:32.429
You are such.

01:06:32.429 --> 01:06:40.710
I'm just trying to help you.

01:06:40.710 --> 01:06:42.710
If you were just listen to me.

01:06:42.710 --> 01:06:44.710
You're just, you're listening to me.

01:06:44.710 --> 01:06:48.150
Oh, yeah, listen to me.

01:06:48.150 --> 01:06:50.150
And they expected more from you.

01:06:50.150 --> 01:06:53.150
Hailey, what are you talking about?

01:06:53.150 --> 01:06:54.150
Gossiping.

01:06:54.150 --> 01:06:56.150
About my posts.

01:06:56.150 --> 01:06:58.150
You're that lonely.

01:06:58.150 --> 01:07:03.670
You've got nothing better to do.

01:07:03.670 --> 01:07:04.670
Hailey.

01:07:04.670 --> 01:07:21.590
Were you left feeling a bit tense?

01:07:21.590 --> 01:07:26.590
If so, you know what uncontrolled anger can lead to.

01:07:26.590 --> 01:07:30.590
Now that we've defined uncontrolled anger

01:07:30.590 --> 01:07:33.590
and considered what it can lead to,

01:07:33.590 --> 01:07:35.590
the next question is,

01:07:35.590 --> 01:07:39.590
how can we put away uncontrolled anger?

01:07:39.590 --> 01:07:44.590
First, we need to recognize the danger of uncontrolled anger.

01:07:44.590 --> 01:07:46.590
Proverbs 25-28 states,

01:07:46.590 --> 01:07:50.590
that as a city broken through without a wall,

01:07:50.590 --> 01:07:54.590
is the man who cannot control his temper.

01:07:54.590 --> 01:07:58.590
Strong city walls were vital in ancient times.

01:07:58.590 --> 01:08:01.590
Without them, a city would quickly fall to invaders,

01:08:01.590 --> 01:08:02.590
likewise.

01:08:02.590 --> 01:08:05.590
So will those who cannot control their temper.

01:08:06.590 --> 01:08:10.590
By losing control, they make themselves vulnerable

01:08:10.590 --> 01:08:13.590
to the invasion of wrong thoughts,

01:08:13.590 --> 01:08:16.590
thoughts that can cause them to hurt themselves,

01:08:16.590 --> 01:08:17.590
and others.

01:08:17.590 --> 01:08:21.590
Uncontrolled anger can do just that.

01:08:21.590 --> 01:08:24.590
Next, after recognizing the danger,

01:08:24.590 --> 01:08:28.590
we must pause and then deal with the anger

01:08:28.590 --> 01:08:32.590
before it causes us to do something that we will regret.

01:08:32.590 --> 01:08:34.590
When anger grows within us,

01:08:34.590 --> 01:08:38.590
we should recall what happened with Simeon and Levi.

01:08:38.590 --> 01:08:42.590
We might also recall what happened in the video dramatization

01:08:42.590 --> 01:08:44.590
that we just viewed.

01:08:44.590 --> 01:08:46.590
You see, in each case,

01:08:46.590 --> 01:08:49.590
pausing before reacting out of anger

01:08:49.590 --> 01:08:51.590
may have spared much pain and heartache.

01:08:51.590 --> 01:08:52.590
True?

01:08:52.590 --> 01:08:57.590
That is why we have this warning at Proverbs 17 and verse 14.

01:08:57.590 --> 01:09:00.590
Before the quarrel breaks out,

01:09:00.590 --> 01:09:02.590
take your leave.

01:09:02.590 --> 01:09:05.590
With that in mind, each of us should ask himself,

01:09:05.590 --> 01:09:10.590
do I tend to jump to conclusions when I don't have all the facts?

01:09:10.590 --> 01:09:14.590
If so, can I take my leave and put away anger

01:09:14.590 --> 01:09:17.590
before it starts to build up?

01:09:17.590 --> 01:09:21.590
The inspired advice found that James 1 and verse 19

01:09:21.590 --> 01:09:23.590
will help us to do so.

01:09:23.590 --> 01:09:27.590
But only if we make a sincere and determined effort

01:09:27.590 --> 01:09:29.590
to apply what it says.

01:09:29.590 --> 01:09:31.590
Let's read that verse.

01:09:31.590 --> 01:09:34.590
James 1 and verse 19.

01:09:34.590 --> 01:09:38.590
And here we find some simple steps to help us put away

01:09:38.590 --> 01:09:40.590
uncontrolled anger.

01:09:40.590 --> 01:09:43.590
It says, no this, my beloved brothers.

01:09:43.590 --> 01:09:51.590
Everyone must be quick to listen, slow to speak, slow to anger.

01:09:51.590 --> 01:09:55.590
If we ask Jehovah to help us with this,

01:09:55.590 --> 01:09:58.590
namely to be quick to listen, slow to speak,

01:09:58.590 --> 01:10:02.590
slow to anger, he will assist us to do so.

01:10:02.590 --> 01:10:05.590
He will help us to see the facts of a matter,

01:10:05.590 --> 01:10:10.590
show understanding, and then put away uncontrolled anger.

01:10:10.590 --> 01:10:15.590
A word of caution, though, to succeed in doing our part,

01:10:15.590 --> 01:10:19.590
we must choose our associates wisely.

01:10:19.590 --> 01:10:22.590
We could undermine all of our good work

01:10:22.590 --> 01:10:26.590
and Jehovah's help in controlling our anger

01:10:26.590 --> 01:10:29.590
if we choose associates who are arrogant,

01:10:29.590 --> 01:10:34.590
opinionated, or quick to become angry.

01:10:34.590 --> 01:10:37.590
Regarding someone who is disposed to rage,

01:10:37.590 --> 01:10:44.590
Proverbs 22, verse 25 warns, never learn his ways.

01:10:44.590 --> 01:10:47.590
Well, we've enjoyed another outstanding series of talks

01:10:47.590 --> 01:10:52.590
that should help us to keep awake, maintain fine conduct,

01:10:52.590 --> 01:10:56.590
and escape the judgment that will soon come in on this world.

01:10:56.590 --> 01:10:59.590
As this symposium has emphasized,

01:10:59.590 --> 01:11:03.590
we must do our utmost to continue to put away peace records,

01:11:03.590 --> 01:11:08.590
such as inappropriate boasting, envy, dishonesty,

01:11:08.590 --> 01:11:12.590
harmful gossip, and uncontrolled anger.

01:11:12.590 --> 01:11:15.590
If we have a problem with any of the peacemaking qualities

01:11:15.590 --> 01:11:18.590
that we have discussed in this symposium,

01:11:18.590 --> 01:11:23.590
seek Jehovah's hope to change, and then work at it.

01:11:23.590 --> 01:11:27.590
Our sincere efforts to pursue peace with our brothers

01:11:27.590 --> 01:11:30.590
and our sisters will influence how earnestly

01:11:30.590 --> 01:11:35.590
we are awaiting Jehovah's Day and his promised new world.

01:11:35.590 --> 01:11:39.590
Yes, our genuine efforts will affect our hearts

01:11:39.590 --> 01:11:42.590
and will be noticed by our Heavenly Father.

01:11:42.590 --> 01:11:45.590
Then, in his great mercy,

01:11:45.590 --> 01:11:49.590
Jehovah will consider us to be, as his word says,

01:11:49.590 --> 01:11:53.590
spotless and unblemished and in peace,

01:11:53.590 --> 01:11:57.590
both with him and with our fellow worshipers.

01:11:57.590 --> 01:12:04.189
Thank you, brothers, for helping us to strengthen our bond of unity.

01:12:04.189 --> 01:12:12.729
Since the rebellion in Eden, peace among mankind as a whole has been lost.

01:12:12.729 --> 01:12:16.729
Despite this, Jehovah has given peace

01:12:16.729 --> 01:12:19.729
to those who trust in him.

01:12:19.729 --> 01:12:22.729
How has he done so in the past?

01:12:22.729 --> 01:12:26.729
And how does this strengthen our faith in him today?

01:12:26.729 --> 01:12:30.729
We invite you to enjoy part one of the documentary,

01:12:30.729 --> 01:12:35.729
Jehovah guides us in the way of peace.

01:12:35.729 --> 01:12:50.029
Peace must be sought above all.

01:12:50.029 --> 01:12:53.029
Our military forces are committed to peace.

01:12:53.029 --> 01:12:56.029
We have chosen peace.

01:12:56.029 --> 01:13:00.029
Our wish, our prayer, is for peace.

01:13:00.029 --> 01:13:03.029
We join for peace.

01:13:03.029 --> 01:13:07.630
We pray for peace.

01:13:07.630 --> 01:13:12.630
For thousands of years, humans have tried to find peace.

01:13:12.630 --> 01:13:19.880
Peace as individuals.

01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:25.140
Peace as families.

01:13:25.140 --> 01:13:36.310
Peace for the entire human race.

01:13:36.310 --> 01:13:39.310
We want to lay the foundation of peace for generations to come.

01:13:39.310 --> 01:13:41.310
We want to do the hard work now.

01:13:41.310 --> 01:13:45.310
So our children and our grandchildren can grow up in a peaceful world.

01:13:45.310 --> 01:13:50.350
The future we want.

01:13:50.350 --> 01:13:55.300
Opportunity and security for our families.

01:13:55.300 --> 01:13:58.300
A rising standard of living.

01:13:58.300 --> 01:14:08.520
A sustainable, peaceful planet for our kids.

01:14:08.520 --> 01:14:13.239
All that is within our reach.

01:14:13.239 --> 01:14:22.539
Yet, despite humans' best efforts, peace has been elusive.

01:14:43.539 --> 01:14:49.539
For millenniums, rulers and governments have tried to achieve peace through treaties,

01:14:49.539 --> 01:15:04.039
resolutions, summits, and ironically, war.

01:15:04.039 --> 01:15:09.039
Our peace as humans is more fragile than ever.

01:15:09.039 --> 01:15:13.039
Man's efforts to bring about lasting peace have failed.

01:15:13.039 --> 01:15:16.039
Time and time again.

01:15:16.039 --> 01:15:19.039
This isn't surprising to us.

01:15:19.039 --> 01:15:27.039
Jeremiah 1023 tells us it does not belong to man to direct his step.

01:15:27.039 --> 01:15:32.039
Humans were simply not designed to rule themselves.

01:15:32.039 --> 01:15:42.039
Good health, safety, overall well-being, these are becoming harder to find as we move further into what the Bible refers to as the last days.

01:15:42.039 --> 01:15:48.039
As long as human rule continues, disunity will continue.

01:15:48.039 --> 01:15:53.039
It's true that global peace cannot be obtained by human efforts alone.

01:15:53.039 --> 01:15:58.039
But those who are close to God can find peace of mind right now.

01:15:58.039 --> 01:16:01.039
As they have 48, 17, and 18 says,

01:16:01.039 --> 01:16:04.039
I, Jehovah, am your God.

01:16:04.039 --> 01:16:07.039
The one teaching you to benefit yourself.

01:16:07.039 --> 01:16:10.039
The one guiding you in the way you should walk.

01:16:10.039 --> 01:16:14.039
If only you would pay attention to my commandments.

01:16:14.039 --> 01:16:18.039
Then your peace would become just like a river.

01:16:18.039 --> 01:16:25.039
It's only Jehovah who has the ability to guide humans to real lasting peace.

01:16:25.039 --> 01:16:29.039
He promises he will bring this about until this happens.

01:16:29.039 --> 01:16:34.039
Jehovah continues to provide ways for us to experience peace now.

01:16:34.039 --> 01:16:36.039
How does he do that?

01:16:36.039 --> 01:16:40.039
By giving us the peace of God, that surpasses all understanding.

01:16:40.039 --> 01:16:57.439
We aren't the only ones whose peace has been challenged.

01:16:57.439 --> 01:17:05.439
God's Word is filled with accounts of faithful servants, whose peace was challenged by the dominating forces of their day.

01:17:05.439 --> 01:17:16.439
As we study and meditate on these accounts, the lessons we learn from them help us to trust in Jehovah as he guides us to peace.

01:17:16.439 --> 01:17:23.439
Understanding how these accounts related Jehovah's purpose to bring peace, I means it as Messianic Kingdom, gives us confidence.

01:17:23.439 --> 01:17:29.439
That his purpose never fails and he will support and guide us on into the future.

01:17:29.439 --> 01:17:35.439
One of Jehovah's prophets who learned this lesson firsthand was Jonah.

01:17:35.439 --> 01:17:39.439
Jonah lived in the 9th century BCE.

01:17:39.439 --> 01:17:44.439
Jehovah signed Jonah to go to Nineveh, a city of the Assyrian Empire.

01:17:44.439 --> 01:17:51.439
Based on what he knew about Nineveh, Jonah considered this to be an intimidating and threatening assignment.

01:17:52.439 --> 01:18:00.439
The Assyrians are known as fierce warriors, and Nineveh itself is later described as a city of bloodshed.

01:18:00.439 --> 01:18:15.180
So you can understand Jonah's trepidation when Jehovah asks him to proclaim a judgment message against this imposing city and its pagan inhabitants.

01:18:15.180 --> 01:18:27.659
In an attempt to find peace, Jonah decides to go far away from Nineveh and boards a boat headed for Tarshish.

01:18:27.659 --> 01:18:31.659
Tarshish is generally associated with modern-day Spain.

01:18:31.659 --> 01:18:39.600
So from Israel, this is the complete opposite direction of Nineveh.

01:18:39.600 --> 01:18:42.600
Jonah found anything but peace.

01:18:42.600 --> 01:19:08.859
Now this was no ordinary storm.

01:19:08.859 --> 01:19:12.859
It was so severe that the ship was in danger of being wrecked.

01:19:12.859 --> 01:19:28.600
The crew cried out to their gods, but Jonah knew the true source of the storm.

01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:33.600
And now he accepts personal responsibility for the situation.

01:19:33.600 --> 01:19:38.600
Lift me up and throw me into the sea, and the sea will calm down for you.

01:19:38.600 --> 01:19:43.600
But I know that it's because of me that this violent storm has come upon you.

01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:51.229
Can you imagine the courage it took for Jonah to make this request?

01:19:51.229 --> 01:19:58.229
He had no way of knowing if Jehovah would save him, but he did not want others to perish on his account.

01:20:10.449 --> 01:20:14.449
In his mercy, Jehovah spares Jonah's life.

01:20:14.449 --> 01:20:16.449
How much to live?

01:20:16.449 --> 01:20:19.449
What will be common with me?

01:20:19.449 --> 01:20:27.449
When faced with a difficult assignment, Jonah got up to run away from Jehovah to Tarshish.

01:20:27.449 --> 01:20:32.449
Jonah's conscience had to bother him. He had to be questioning his decision.

01:20:32.449 --> 01:20:38.449
He tried to take matters into his own hands, tried to find his own peace.

01:20:39.449 --> 01:20:43.449
Where does he find himself in the belly of a fish?

01:20:43.449 --> 01:20:46.449
Yet he calls to Jehovah in a moment of despair.

01:20:46.449 --> 01:20:58.000
Oh, Jehovah, out of the depths of the grave, I cry to you for help.

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:06.819
Please hear my voice. What I have vowed, I will pay.

01:21:06.819 --> 01:21:13.449
Jonah could have reasoned that this was the end of his assignment as Jehovah's Prophet.

01:21:13.449 --> 01:21:21.100
After all, he did disobey direction.

01:21:21.100 --> 01:21:27.100
So likely he was surprised to hear the word of Jehovah come to him a second time.

01:21:27.100 --> 01:21:45.329
Bow to him over the great city and proclaim to her the message that I tell you.

01:21:45.329 --> 01:21:51.819
Yes, yes, thank you.

01:21:51.819 --> 01:22:06.289
At first, Jonah trusted in himself and didn't understand that Jehovah would protect him from the violent assyrians.

01:22:06.289 --> 01:22:09.289
But after being given a second chance, what happens?

01:22:09.289 --> 01:22:16.289
Well, then he puts aside his human concerns and looks to Jehovah for protection.

01:22:16.289 --> 01:22:30.479
In just 40 days more, Nineveh will be overthrown.

01:22:30.479 --> 01:22:35.479
Jehovah, the true God has spoken, this city will be destroyed.

01:22:35.479 --> 01:22:38.479
Nineveh will be overthrown.

01:22:38.479 --> 01:22:41.479
True God will overthrow Nineveh.

01:22:41.479 --> 01:22:52.189
Eventually, the king himself repents and orders everyone to Nineveh to do the same.

01:22:52.189 --> 01:22:56.189
Jonah learned a valuable lesson from this experience.

01:22:56.189 --> 01:23:05.189
By recently running away from Nineveh, he chose to trust in himself rather than putting his trust in Jehovah.

01:23:05.189 --> 01:23:13.210
Are you Jonah? Mommy said he saved us.

01:23:13.210 --> 01:23:17.210
No, Jehovah saved you.

01:23:17.210 --> 01:23:21.869
I was just a messenger.

01:23:21.869 --> 01:23:29.470
Jonah learned that without a doubt, Jehovah protects those who trust and obey him.

01:23:29.470 --> 01:23:36.470
If Jehovah's asked you to do something, if he's asked me to do something, if he's leading us,

01:23:36.470 --> 01:23:40.470
he absolutely will guide us through it.

01:23:40.470 --> 01:23:43.470
Jonah's account proves this.

01:23:43.470 --> 01:23:49.470
Although the Ninevites were spared, because they repented, that's true.

01:23:49.470 --> 01:23:54.470
Aceria later returned to its evil wicked ways.

01:23:54.470 --> 01:24:00.470
About a century after Jonah's judgment message, King Sanakarab of Assyria,

01:24:00.470 --> 01:24:06.470
brought his armies against the cities of Judah, including the city he wanted most.

01:24:06.470 --> 01:24:09.779
Jerusalem.

01:24:09.779 --> 01:24:15.779
King Hezekiah of Judah was an outstanding king who held fast to Jehovah.

01:24:15.779 --> 01:24:23.779
From the beginning of his reign, he proved to be zealous for true worship, not only in Judah, but in all of Israel.

01:24:23.779 --> 01:24:27.779
Hezekiah had done so much to stand up for pure worship.

01:24:27.779 --> 01:24:38.170
Yet now he is faced with the prospect of a siege against Jerusalem by Sanakarab's armies.

01:24:38.170 --> 01:24:43.170
Hezekiah agrees to pay Sanakarab a tribute in return for peace.

01:24:43.170 --> 01:24:53.909
The armies continue their conquests, as Sanakarab and his men besieged the strongly fortified city of Lakeish.

01:24:53.909 --> 01:25:02.909
From here, Sanakarab sends a part of his army, as well as military chiefs to Jerusalem in an attempt to demand surrender.

01:25:02.909 --> 01:25:07.909
The spokesman for the group was the Rapshaqah, who spoke Hebrew fluently.

01:25:07.909 --> 01:25:12.909
He loudly ridiculed Hezekiah and taunted Jehovah,

01:25:12.909 --> 01:25:17.909
boasting that Jehovah was no match against King Sanakarab.

01:25:17.909 --> 01:25:20.909
Imagine what these soldiers must have been thinking.

01:25:20.909 --> 01:25:25.909
Sanakarab's armies were on a war path, taking city after city.

01:25:25.909 --> 01:25:31.289
To Hezekiah, this was a defining moment.

01:25:31.289 --> 01:25:36.289
He had to decide if he would trust in himself or trust in Jehovah.

01:25:36.289 --> 01:25:47.279
My brothers, we must remember that Jehovah is fully able to rescue us just as he has in times past.

01:25:48.279 --> 01:25:54.550
Will you not even now face the facts?

01:25:54.550 --> 01:26:01.550
We are trapped. These Syrians are at our gate and you clink to the belief that nothing bad will happen.

01:26:01.550 --> 01:26:05.550
You will destroy everything you so hope to preserve.

01:26:05.550 --> 01:26:07.550
The Temple of Jerusalem, our very life.

01:26:07.550 --> 01:26:08.550
Shedna.

01:26:08.550 --> 01:26:11.550
I'm not blind to the dangers that we face.

01:26:11.550 --> 01:26:13.550
I too am afraid.

01:26:13.550 --> 01:26:17.550
But if Jehovah allows Jerusalem to fall so be it.

01:26:17.550 --> 01:26:20.550
How can we give up what belongs to Jehovah?

01:26:20.550 --> 01:26:23.899
So as a man of faith,

01:26:23.899 --> 01:26:28.899
Hezekiah focused on Jehovah's ability to save his people

01:26:28.899 --> 01:26:32.899
despite Sanakarab's continued advances toward Jerusalem.

01:26:32.899 --> 01:26:38.029
I'm curious about this.

01:26:38.029 --> 01:26:40.029
King of yours.

01:26:40.029 --> 01:26:43.029
What does he think will come to save him from me?

01:26:43.029 --> 01:26:48.079
Jehovah, your God.

01:26:48.079 --> 01:26:50.079
Is weak!

01:26:51.079 --> 01:26:56.079
He will cringe before my God, Asher.

01:26:56.079 --> 01:27:02.619
Hezekiah remained determined to trust in Jehovah.

01:27:02.619 --> 01:27:07.619
This decision required a tremendous amount of faith,

01:27:07.619 --> 01:27:15.619
especially with more than 185,000 Assyrian soldiers headed towards Jerusalem.

01:27:18.819 --> 01:27:21.819
Instead of trusting in Himself,

01:27:21.819 --> 01:27:27.819
He continued to look for Jehovah as the source of true peace,

01:27:27.819 --> 01:27:30.819
even as an attack seemed imminent.

01:27:30.819 --> 01:27:45.010
And Jehovah again showed just how insignificant human rulers are in comparison to Him.

01:27:45.010 --> 01:28:07.479
Hezekiah learned that when a way out seems impossible,

01:28:07.479 --> 01:28:11.479
trust in Jehovah always leads to success.

01:28:11.479 --> 01:28:15.479
Jehovah rewarded that trust with victory over the Assyrians.

01:28:15.479 --> 01:28:20.479
This is a lesson we can apply now and in the near future.

01:28:20.479 --> 01:28:24.479
There may be situations where true worshipers seem trapped.

01:28:24.479 --> 01:28:28.479
But never forget, Jehovah is all-powerful.

01:28:28.479 --> 01:28:30.479
He's leading His people,

01:28:30.479 --> 01:28:33.479
and we can follow His guidance with full confidence.

01:28:33.479 --> 01:28:38.479
Jehovah will protect those who trust in Him at Armageddon.

01:28:38.479 --> 01:28:43.479
Jerusalem remains safe against attack for the time being.

01:28:43.479 --> 01:28:46.479
But peaceful conditions didn't last long.

01:28:46.479 --> 01:28:53.140
Asekiah's son, Manasa, did what was detestable in the eyes of Jehovah.

01:28:53.140 --> 01:28:59.140
He brought back veil worship and personally took its vialist practices to extremes,

01:28:59.140 --> 01:29:04.140
even putting a carved image of a false god right inside Jehovah's Temple.

01:29:05.140 --> 01:29:11.140
So here you have a king who's supposed to be protecting the people from idolatrous influence,

01:29:11.140 --> 01:29:15.140
doing the exact opposite, building altars to false gods.

01:29:15.140 --> 01:29:21.140
He even went so far as to pass His own sons through the fire, sacrificing them to these gods.

01:29:21.140 --> 01:29:26.140
The peace with God that Hezekiah worked so hard to achieve for the nation

01:29:26.140 --> 01:29:30.140
is now reversed by the actions of His Son.

01:29:30.140 --> 01:29:34.140
Because of this, Jehovah punished Manasa severely.

01:29:34.140 --> 01:29:38.140
He allowed the king of Assyria to take him captive to Babylon.

01:29:38.140 --> 01:29:43.140
While in captivity, Manasa ultimately repented.

01:29:43.140 --> 01:29:48.140
He humbled himself, and he stayed faithful right to the end of his life.

01:29:48.140 --> 01:29:49.140
Grandfather.

01:29:49.140 --> 01:29:53.140
We can imagine him impressing the importance of faithfulness to Jehovah

01:29:53.140 --> 01:29:56.140
on his young grandson, Josiah.

01:29:56.140 --> 01:30:02.579
Listen to me, Jehovah is holy,

01:30:02.579 --> 01:30:08.579
and you must serve him the way he wants us to,

01:30:08.579 --> 01:30:14.470
all other gods, a powerless.

01:30:14.470 --> 01:30:22.470
Yet in spite of all this, the people still thought that they could serve Jehovah and Bale.

01:30:22.470 --> 01:30:28.470
So after becoming king, Josiah started a campaign against idolatry.

01:30:28.470 --> 01:30:30.470
I've seen this cheaper.

01:30:30.470 --> 01:30:33.739
I think I'll leave it.

01:30:33.739 --> 01:30:41.590
We start here.

01:30:41.590 --> 01:31:01.359
We will do to every false god in the land.

01:31:01.359 --> 01:31:09.949
He tore down altars used for false worship, sacred poles, images, and statues.

01:31:09.949 --> 01:31:12.949
He was intent on cleansing the land of idolatry.

01:31:12.949 --> 01:31:20.949
He showed remarkable courage to stand up for true worship at a time when few were doing so.

01:31:20.949 --> 01:31:24.949
There's no doubt this was a difficult task.

01:31:24.949 --> 01:31:28.949
At times, he may have even wondered if he was doing the right thing.

01:31:29.949 --> 01:31:36.869
It's possible, Jehovah provided Josiah with assurance from the Prophet Jeremiah.

01:31:36.869 --> 01:31:38.869
This is what Jehovah says.

01:31:38.869 --> 01:31:44.869
Look, a son named Josiah will be born to the house of David,

01:31:44.869 --> 01:31:49.869
and he will sacrifice on you the priests of the high places,

01:31:49.869 --> 01:31:53.869
those making sacrificial smoke on you,

01:31:53.869 --> 01:31:58.979
and he will burn human bones on you.

01:31:58.979 --> 01:32:09.979
That prophecy made over 300 years earlier confirmed that Josiah was the one prophesied to act against false worship.

01:32:09.979 --> 01:32:15.979
This may have given Josiah even greater incentive and courage to continue his campaign,

01:32:15.979 --> 01:32:18.979
which now included repairing the temple.

01:32:18.979 --> 01:32:25.979
These actions contributed to the peaceful conditions that elevated pure worship.

01:32:25.979 --> 01:32:28.979
Josiah did so much to restore pure worship.

01:32:28.979 --> 01:32:33.979
That is why we love him, yet the people's heart condition remained polluted,

01:32:33.979 --> 01:32:37.979
so the nation required severe discipline.

01:32:37.979 --> 01:32:42.979
Jeremiah prophesied a conquest of the Babylonians against Judah.

01:32:42.979 --> 01:32:46.979
All this land will be reduced to ruins,

01:32:46.979 --> 01:32:52.979
and this land and its inhabitants will have to serve the king of Babylon for 70 years.

01:32:52.979 --> 01:32:56.979
Daniel himself may have heard Jeremiah speak those words,

01:32:56.979 --> 01:33:03.300
and he certainly saw it come true as he and his family were exiled to Babylon.

01:33:03.300 --> 01:33:05.300
Talk about peace being interrupted.

01:33:05.300 --> 01:33:14.050
Daniel was a young Judean prince taken from his homeland, separated from his family,

01:33:14.050 --> 01:33:19.050
but being chosen to receive special training in the court of King Nebuchadnezzar,

01:33:19.050 --> 01:33:22.050
represented another set of challenges.

01:33:22.050 --> 01:33:28.050
The entire way of Babylonian life was contrary to a Daniel knew growing up in Judah,

01:33:28.050 --> 01:33:35.050
but Daniel was determined not to pollute himself, with foods Jehovah would not approve of.

01:33:35.050 --> 01:33:39.619
And Jehovah blessed Daniel's determination to be faithful,

01:33:39.619 --> 01:33:44.619
as he was selected to serve as one of King Nebuchadnezzar's wise men.

01:33:44.619 --> 01:33:57.619
Nebuchadnezzar was a warrior king intent on building a great empire.

01:33:58.619 --> 01:34:05.619
After he officially took the throne in 624 BCE, his domain grew with each conquest.

01:34:05.619 --> 01:34:11.600
Babylon became an epicenter of trade and commerce.

01:34:11.600 --> 01:34:18.600
Nebuchadnezzar undertook huge building projects throughout the city, which made the city seem impregnable.

01:34:18.600 --> 01:34:23.600
Imagine the sense of security, the inhabitants of Babylon must have felt,

01:34:23.600 --> 01:34:28.140
what safely behind the city's walls.

01:34:28.140 --> 01:34:35.140
Nebuchadnezzar attributed the prosperity and security all around him to the power of his false gods.

01:34:35.140 --> 01:34:39.140
The chief of these false gods was Marduk, the god of war.

01:34:39.140 --> 01:34:45.699
Yet these false gods and their priests would prove worthless.

01:34:45.699 --> 01:34:50.699
One night, King Nebuchadnezzar had a strange dream.

01:34:50.699 --> 01:35:05.600
Hey, may you live on forever.

01:35:05.600 --> 01:35:06.600
Relate the dream to your service.

01:35:06.600 --> 01:35:08.600
We will tell the interpretation.

01:35:08.600 --> 01:35:09.600
No.

01:35:09.600 --> 01:35:14.600
If you don't make the dream known to me, along with the interpretation, you'll be dismembered.

01:35:14.600 --> 01:35:18.600
And your houses will be turned to public latrines.

01:35:18.600 --> 01:35:22.600
There is not a man on earth who can do with the King demands.

01:35:22.600 --> 01:35:24.600
What the King is asking is difficult.

01:35:24.600 --> 01:35:25.600
No one exists.

01:35:25.600 --> 01:35:35.810
Can tell this to the King except the gods.

01:35:35.810 --> 01:35:36.810
Seize them.

01:35:36.810 --> 01:35:39.630
Kill them!

01:35:39.630 --> 01:35:43.130
Kira.

01:35:43.130 --> 01:35:44.130
You're in danger.

01:35:44.130 --> 01:35:45.130
Why what happened?

01:35:45.130 --> 01:35:46.130
He hears.

01:35:46.130 --> 01:35:48.130
But the wise man angered the King.

01:35:48.130 --> 01:35:50.130
Everyone's to be executed by dawn.

01:35:50.130 --> 01:35:54.130
Bring Hanna and I, Michelle, and Ezraia here.

01:35:54.130 --> 01:35:56.130
I'll try to learn more.

01:35:56.130 --> 01:36:01.130
This edict to kill all the wise men would also include Daniel and his companions.

01:36:01.130 --> 01:36:04.130
So let's look at this from Daniel's perspective.

01:36:04.130 --> 01:36:11.130
Here he is, young man in a foreign land, serving in the court of one of the most powerful and violent men alive.

01:36:11.130 --> 01:36:16.130
And that man is now demanding that someone in effect read his mind.

01:36:16.130 --> 01:36:22.300
Tell me my dream and tell me what it means.

01:36:22.300 --> 01:36:23.300
Okay.

01:36:24.300 --> 01:36:27.300
Interpretations belong to my God, Jehovah.

01:36:27.300 --> 01:36:30.300
He knows your dream and what it means.

01:36:30.300 --> 01:36:34.449
Well, where is your God?

01:36:34.449 --> 01:36:37.689
Where?

01:36:37.689 --> 01:36:39.689
I believe that he...

01:36:39.689 --> 01:36:42.689
I know that he will reveal it to me.

01:36:42.689 --> 01:36:44.689
Please, give me time.

01:36:44.689 --> 01:36:51.279
Daniel is not acting on previous experience.

01:36:51.279 --> 01:36:55.279
He hasn't received interpretations of dreams from Jehovah.

01:36:55.279 --> 01:37:02.279
Instead, he is acting on faith, faith that he had learned by studying the sacred books of his time.

01:37:02.279 --> 01:37:11.279
These books likely included the inspired writings of Moses and David Solomon, Isaiah, Jeremiah, and other prophets.

01:37:11.279 --> 01:37:14.279
Oh, we can only imagine Daniel.

01:37:14.279 --> 01:37:23.279
Pouring over these scrolls, opening up his heart to Jehovah begging Jehovah to give him wisdom and understanding, he loved it.

01:37:23.279 --> 01:37:33.279
And there's no doubt that as Daniel studied these accounts, his faith was strengthened and his bond with Jehovah drew even closer.

01:37:33.279 --> 01:37:43.279
Even though Daniel knew nothing of King Nebuchadnezzar's dream, he was fully convinced that Jehovah would reveal the dream and its interpretation.

01:37:43.279 --> 01:37:47.279
And proved to be Daniel's salvation.

01:37:47.279 --> 01:37:52.279
Do we know exactly which accounts Daniel was able to draw from at this time?

01:37:52.279 --> 01:37:58.279
It's impossible to say for a certainty, but we do know he had access to the books.

01:37:58.279 --> 01:38:01.279
He references the prophecies of Jeremiah.

01:38:01.279 --> 01:38:06.279
Daniel could see how Jehovah blessed faithful, obedient men in the past.

01:38:06.279 --> 01:38:11.279
So by asking Nebuchadnezzar for time, he wasn't looking to buy himself another day of life.

01:38:11.279 --> 01:38:16.279
He was allowing Jehovah to reward his faith by revealing the dream to him.

01:38:16.279 --> 01:38:22.939
Daniel strikes a balance here.

01:38:22.939 --> 01:38:31.939
Although he is confident that Jehovah will reveal the dream to him, he isn't casual in the way he handled the situation.

01:38:31.939 --> 01:38:35.939
He did what any God-fearing man would do here.

01:38:35.939 --> 01:38:39.939
He approached Jehovah in prayer.

01:38:39.939 --> 01:38:44.939
Oh Jehovah, surely you didn't bring us here just to die.

01:38:44.939 --> 01:38:47.939
What will people say?

01:38:47.939 --> 01:38:54.939
We told them that you are the God of the heavens, the only God who can reveal secrets.

01:38:54.939 --> 01:39:00.500
Please, vindicate yourself.

01:39:00.500 --> 01:39:43.189
The man from the axiles of Judah, who can make known the interpretation to the King.

01:39:43.189 --> 01:39:47.369
I know who he is.

01:39:47.369 --> 01:39:51.369
Can you really make known to me the dream that I saw and its interpretation?

01:39:51.369 --> 01:40:09.800
There is a God in the heavens who is a revealer of secrets.

01:40:09.800 --> 01:40:18.710
And he has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar what is to happen in the final part of the days.

01:40:18.710 --> 01:40:20.710
This is your dream.

01:40:20.710 --> 01:40:39.649
You saw an immense image.

01:40:39.649 --> 01:40:42.649
That image was standing in front of you.

01:40:42.649 --> 01:40:50.300
You yourself are the head of gold.

01:40:50.300 --> 01:40:55.300
After you, another kingdom will rise and fear you to you.

01:40:55.300 --> 01:40:58.300
Then another kingdom.

01:40:58.300 --> 01:41:03.300
A third one of copper that will rule over the whole earth.

01:41:03.300 --> 01:41:10.220
As for the fourth kingdom, it will be strong like iron.

01:41:10.220 --> 01:41:13.220
The kingdom will be divided.

01:41:13.220 --> 01:41:18.220
And as the toes of the feet were partly of iron and partly of clay,

01:41:18.220 --> 01:41:26.479
so the kingdom will be partly strong and partly fragile.

01:41:26.479 --> 01:41:31.479
This took a tremendous amount of faith and courage on the part of Daniel.

01:41:31.479 --> 01:41:34.479
Now we may find our peace threatened.

01:41:34.479 --> 01:41:37.479
Our very lives might be on the line.

01:41:37.479 --> 01:41:43.479
In that moment, we can turn to Jehovah God in prayer, opening up our hearts,

01:41:43.479 --> 01:41:47.479
confident that He will support us.

01:41:47.479 --> 01:41:52.479
Like both Daniel and Jonah, we've been given an assignment to proclaim a message.

01:41:52.479 --> 01:41:57.479
This requires courage to speak out boldly concerning Jehovah's judgments

01:41:57.479 --> 01:42:00.479
against those who oppose his sovereignty.

01:42:00.479 --> 01:42:07.479
Both of these prophets are excellent examples of Jehovah backing those who trust in Him.

01:42:07.479 --> 01:42:12.479
Jehovah will always be with us as long as we have faith in Him.

01:42:12.479 --> 01:42:17.479
When we face situations that seem impossible as in the case with Hezekiah,

01:42:17.479 --> 01:42:23.479
we have the ability to tap into the most powerful force there is.

01:42:23.479 --> 01:42:26.479
As this system comes to a close,

01:42:26.479 --> 01:42:32.479
we will find ourselves in situations that test our courage and threaten our peace.

01:42:32.479 --> 01:42:37.479
We will have to stand up for pure worship, just like Josiah,

01:42:37.479 --> 01:42:39.479
and this will be unpopular.

01:42:39.479 --> 01:42:44.479
But with Jehovah on our side, we can face those situations with confidence.

01:42:44.479 --> 01:42:48.479
He's all powerful, and He's going to help us through it.

01:42:48.479 --> 01:42:51.479
Now here's the interesting thing.

01:42:51.479 --> 01:42:59.479
Some of the prophecies that Daniel recorded applied not only to the future of the Babylonian Empire,

01:42:59.479 --> 01:43:05.479
but also outline world events to our day and beyond.

01:43:05.479 --> 01:43:12.479
And these events are being fulfilled right before our very eyes.

01:43:12.479 --> 01:43:23.130
What a motivating presentation.

01:43:23.130 --> 01:43:26.130
Even when our peace is threatened,

01:43:26.130 --> 01:43:31.130
we can focus on how our integrity relates to Jehovah's purpose,

01:43:31.130 --> 01:43:35.130
and we can endure with joy.

01:43:35.130 --> 01:43:39.130
We look forward to watching part two of this important consideration

01:43:39.130 --> 01:43:42.130
during the final session of our convention.

01:43:42.130 --> 01:43:47.130
Now let's sing together song number 130, entitled,

01:43:47.130 --> 01:43:51.130
Be Forgiven, that song number 130.
