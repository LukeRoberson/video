Hello. Who is it? Hey, hi. How are you? Okay, come on up.

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:23.160
My name is Enrique Torres Jr. I live in Staten Island, New York, and I have the privilege

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:44.310
to serve in the Mid-Anon congregation. First 40 years of my life were martyred in a lifestyle

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:54.219
that was horrendous. A judge stated that I had a propensity for criminality. Well, no

00:00:54.219 --> 00:01:07.180
doubt he was describing a vicious person. I said, you, I was hanging around with the

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:15.870
wrong kind of people that led me into a life of crime and debauchery. This captain in

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:23.170
our prison came up with a psychological plan to take the individuals that had the potential

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:31.689
for leadership and put him in isolation. I wind up a via a mountain. Can you imagine they

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:40.189
were getting beat up? It was becoming too much for me, the screams and so forth. I said,

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:50.799
this continuum, I'm not going to survive here. I did get in contact with my father and

00:01:50.799 --> 00:02:00.900
he told me, never forget your hope. That was his name. And that's all I got out of it.

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:06.379
I knew that there was nobody that could help me but God. So that's when I found myself

00:02:06.379 --> 00:02:13.300
in prayer to Jehovah. I vowed that I would make it my business to learn more about him

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:19.219
than just his name. At that time, that's all I knew. I got some literature. I got the

00:02:19.219 --> 00:02:28.500
Bible too. Jehovah became all meaningful to me. That's when he became real to me. That

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:35.259
was the first 40 years of my life. But the last 40 years of my life with Jehovah's

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:43.620
training from his organization, my personality, it was transformed. The blessings that I have

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:50.819
received has been in the area of my field service and also my teaching ability, which has

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:58.060
helped me to be able to draw closer to Jehovah. I was privileged to become a ministerial

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:07.659
servant for many years, field service overseer for many more years. One of the main challenges

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:18.020
that I'm facing is that I have developed cancer and have gone through four cancer operations

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:27.819
and also some chemotherapy. Without relying upon Jehovah to help me to overcome these challenges,

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:35.080
there's no doubt in my mind that I never would have been able to make it. I would recommend

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:43.120
to avoid that trap that I fell into hanging around with street gangs and then getting

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:50.120
involved in burglaries, robberies, with some progression. It was not all anything of

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:59.080
value at all. Instead, what it brought me was a lot of grief, mental scars and also a lot

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:07.330
of trouble for my conscience. Study God's Word, the Bible, so that you may be able to see

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:13.250
what Jehovah has in store for the future and also you'll be able to see that he's a

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:19.449
kind, merciful, loving God that doesn't want no one to be destroyed but wants them to

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:29.550
have life. Parents, never give up on your children. Jehovah, I never gave up on me. And

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:38.269
he rescued me from the spiritual darkness that I was in and he brought me into his light and

00:04:38.269 --> 00:04:46.350
to his wonderful organization and I give him all the credit for that and when I speak to people,

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:52.829
that's what I tell him. It was a means, Jehovah that's done all of this and it could do

00:04:52.829 --> 00:04:55.629
that for you too if you give him an opportunity.
