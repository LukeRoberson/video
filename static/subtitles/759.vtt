WEBVTT

00:00:01.139 --> 00:00:07.139
Well, in any graduation program, we get to the point where the principal talk or the

00:00:07.139 --> 00:00:12.140
main talk is given, and this time we have a special privilege of having a long time

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:18.140
member of the governing body, brother Samuel Hood, speak to us, and the subject that he has

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:26.140
a very interesting subject any day now. Brother Hood, please.

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:33.140
You will be going home or to a new assignment. We want you to know that you will be missed.

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:40.640
It was good for the Bethel family to have you with us. It was a blessing from Jehovah.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:47.640
Like a pregnant woman, your bellies are swell to the limit. All the signs tell you that

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:55.640
maybe is about to be born. You're rushed to see the doctor. He examines you, and you ask,

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:04.640
when? He says, any day now. Your minds and hearts are about to burst with spiritual

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:13.640
things to deliver to others. Yes, this is a day for delivering. Your spiritually

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:20.640
is contagious. When you walk into a room, you bring sunshine with you. Notice what

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:28.640
Jesus said to some of His followers. Matthew 5, 14 through 16, you are the light of the

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:35.640
world. The city cannot be hid when located on a mountain. People light a lamp and

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:44.640
set it not under a basket, but on the lampstand, and it shines on all those in the house.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:51.640
Likewise, let your light shine before men, so that they may see your fine works and give

00:01:51.640 --> 00:02:00.640
glory to your father who is in the heavens. First of all, your spiritual brothers and

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:10.639
sisters are in the house with you. Shine on them, but don't limit it to them. We want

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:17.639
others to see the light. For the past five months, you have been studying the

00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:27.240
personality of Jehovah, and talking to Him by means of prayer. While it's true,

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:34.240
humans cannot see the literal person, Jehovah. For Jehovah God to set down a

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:41.240
description of Himself in spirit terms would be like trying to explain colors to a

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:49.610
person born blind. You have been asking for Him to help you in your studies, and He

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:57.610
has helped you. Without His help, you would not be graduating. Now you're ready.

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:07.610
As never before to let your light shine on your fleshly family members, your Bible

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:15.610
students, and your spiritual brothers and sisters. But don't make it so bright and

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:24.610
intense that you put out the eyes of those around you. Turn the wick down in your

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:33.610
lamp. There is no need to say every time. We were taught this in Gilead. We were

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:40.610
taught this in one of our Gilead classes. A member of the governing body called this

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:48.629
to our attention in a lecture he gave. You knew some things before you come to

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:56.629
Gilead. You knew God's name is Jehovah, and that it is unique, meaning the only

00:03:56.629 --> 00:04:09.229
one of its kind. My name is Sam. Samuel or Sammy. It is not unique. There are many

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:16.230
others with the same name. I was named after my father's brother, Uncle Sam.

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:24.230
Did you get that? Uncle Sam. I did not name myself. A baby doesn't say when eight

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:33.279
months in his mother's womb. Mommy, when I get out, call me Sammy. God Almighty

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:44.279
chose His name, Jehovah. He named Himself. That is different. That is unique.

00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:53.279
You, Gilead students, soon to be Gilead graduates, no Jehovah, but not completely,

00:04:53.279 --> 00:05:03.279
not the whole person, just the fringe. Compare what you see to an ornamental edging of hanging

00:05:03.279 --> 00:05:13.810
threads of a garment. You don't see the whole garment. Romans 11, 33 to 36 says,

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:20.810
Oh, the depth of God's riches and wisdom and knowledge. How unsearchable His judgments

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:30.810
are, and beyond treason out His ways are. For who has come to know Jehovah's mind,

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:39.810
or who has become His advisor, or who has first given to Him so that it must be

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:49.810
repaid to Him, because from Him and by Him and for Him are all things, to Him be

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:53.810
the glory forever. Amen.

00:05:53.810 --> 00:06:03.810
Job 36, 26 tells us, Yes, God is greater than we can know. The number of His years

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:11.810
is beyond comprehension. No matter how much knowledge we have accumulated in our brain,

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:23.810
it amounts to a grain of sand on a seashore when we live forever. Forever, that is an

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:35.810
interesting word. It is defined as never ending, incessantly ceaseless. That's enough to

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:44.810
blow an imperfect man's mind away, but not Jehovah's mind, and he promises obedient humans

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:54.480
ever lasting, never ending life. I'm going to read a scripture to you without

00:06:54.480 --> 00:07:01.480
revealing where it is found in the Bible. It is one of the first that captured my

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:08.480
attention back in 1956. Now, that was before any of you were born. With that I

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:19.480
heard a loud voice from the Sronesee. Look, the tet of God is with mankind, and He will

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:27.480
reside with them, and they will be His people, and God Himself will be with them, and He

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:35.480
will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more. Neither

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:46.480
were morning nor outcry nor pain be anymore. The former things have passed away.

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:55.480
Where in the Bible? Revelation 21, 3 and 4. I knew you would know that one. We were

00:07:55.480 --> 00:08:02.480
limited to how much knowledge our brains can understand and sort out correctly. Yes,

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:12.480
one day we will know much more than we know today, but we will not know it all.

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:24.240
That's good. You will never be a know it all. Now is the time to let your light shine.

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:31.240
Our work at the present is to inform people that the kingdom of God, the heaven of

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:38.240
the government, is the only remedy to the woes of mankind that is causing so much

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:47.899
suffering and death. Inform people of the kingdom, but don't blind them with your

00:08:47.899 --> 00:08:55.899
bright light of knowledge learned at Gilead. A little light will be enough for them to

00:08:55.899 --> 00:09:04.179
see where to go. When I was in the army, in Germany, years ago, I drove a truck

00:09:04.179 --> 00:09:12.179
with five men inside and M-101 howitzer artillery gun attached to the rear of the

00:09:12.179 --> 00:09:19.179
truck. We traveled during a pitch dark night with no lights used. We could only

00:09:19.179 --> 00:09:30.179
see the tail light of the vehicle in front. That was enough light to follow. Keep in

00:09:30.179 --> 00:09:38.179
mind there may not be enough time left for your students and new brothers and

00:09:38.179 --> 00:09:48.179
sisters to learn all that you know. Feed them not a heavy meal of steak and baked

00:09:48.179 --> 00:09:59.879
potatoes, but an appetizer to stimulate the juices in the mouth. Any day now nations

00:09:59.879 --> 00:10:06.879
will cause the peoples who are looking to them for guidance to think they have

00:10:06.879 --> 00:10:15.879
finally established peace. The need for peace is already being talked about by

00:10:15.879 --> 00:10:25.379
national leaders. We're not fooled by this sham cry of peace and security. First

00:10:25.379 --> 00:10:34.379
Cecilonian 5.3 says, whenever it is that they are saying peace and security, then

00:10:34.379 --> 00:10:43.379
sudden destruction is to be instantly on them. Just like birth pains on a pregnant

00:10:43.379 --> 00:10:52.379
woman, and they will, by no means, escape. Jehovah will have the political powers of

00:10:52.379 --> 00:11:00.379
this world turn against Babylon the Great. That's false religion. After they see the

00:11:00.379 --> 00:11:10.379
hand-write on the wall for her and destroy her, sudden destruction, instantly. It

00:11:10.379 --> 00:11:17.379
won't take long. Her supporters will cry out weeping and mourning and say,

00:11:17.379 --> 00:11:29.379
too bad, too bad. But we will be thinking, I'm glad, I'm glad. Revelation 18

00:11:29.379 --> 00:11:38.379
20 says, be glad over her. Oh heaven, also you holy ones and apostles and

00:11:38.379 --> 00:11:46.379
prophets, because God has pronounced His judgment on her in your behalf. Are you

00:11:46.379 --> 00:11:57.759
ready? Are you ready to be glad over her destruction? I think you are, but I can't

00:11:57.759 --> 00:12:05.759
make that determination. We will know if we were ready as Jehovah

00:12:05.759 --> 00:12:12.759
protects us when the nations turn their guns on us.

00:12:12.759 --> 00:12:19.759
Now is the time for us to continue strengthening our faith and trust in Jehovah's

00:12:19.759 --> 00:12:33.159
love for us. Study, meditate, associate, and preach the kingdom. Young David, when

00:12:33.159 --> 00:12:42.570
facing Goliath had five smooth stones in his pouch, pouch of his shepherd's

00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:51.980
bag, he only used one, but he was prepared in case he needed more. When we read

00:12:51.980 --> 00:13:00.980
the Bible and meditate on it, our figurative heart absorbs God's word, like

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:07.980
putting symbolic stones in our figurative heart. This gives us the inner

00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:13.980
strength we need to preach the kingdom message now and to proclaim the

00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:21.980
hard-hitting judgment message that we may deliver in the near future. The

00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:31.799
day for salvation will be closed any day now. When Noah had gathered all the

00:13:31.799 --> 00:13:37.799
creatures that Jehovah had designated, along with all necessary food needed for

00:13:37.799 --> 00:13:45.799
all in the ark, they went into the ark. Note it was Jehovah that closed the door,

00:13:45.799 --> 00:13:54.799
not Noah. Genesis 7 and 16 says, so they went in male and female of every sort

00:13:54.799 --> 00:14:02.799
of flesh, just as God had commanded him. After that, Jehovah shut the door behind

00:14:02.799 --> 00:14:09.799
him. We don't take it upon ourselves to close the door to salvation. Jehovah shuts

00:14:09.799 --> 00:14:16.799
the door and we can't push it open to let mom or anyone else in. You

00:14:16.799 --> 00:14:21.799
Gileadites are professional preachers and teachers. You have received training

00:14:21.799 --> 00:14:26.799
that not many of your brothers and sisters will have the privilege to receive

00:14:26.799 --> 00:14:34.799
this side of Armageddon. Yes, without a doubt, you are wiser now than you used

00:14:34.799 --> 00:14:43.799
to be, but not as wise as Jesus was when He said, what I teach is not mine, but

00:14:43.799 --> 00:14:54.799
belongs to Him who sent me, John 7, 16. We believe Jehovah sent you to Gilead.

00:14:54.799 --> 00:15:01.799
Keep foremost in mind that what you teach belongs to Jehovah and conduct

00:15:01.799 --> 00:15:09.799
yourselves in a manner that displays that. Let your light shine not too bright,

00:15:09.799 --> 00:15:32.909
just a flicker as needed before night falls, any day now. Don't worry brother,

00:15:32.909 --> 00:15:37.909
heard those one people leaving because they were upset with your talk. That's

00:15:37.909 --> 00:15:42.909
the students going backstage. Brotherhood, we love the talk. It was classic

00:15:42.909 --> 00:15:47.909
heard and we really enjoyed the points you brought out. It was very comforting for

00:15:47.909 --> 00:15:52.909
me because this is the first time we've had two Jeffries on the same program, but

00:15:52.909 --> 00:15:57.909
speaking on behalf of the other members of the governing body, we know there is only

00:15:57.909 --> 00:16:05.909
one unique Samuel heard and we love you for it. Well, now we have this part

00:16:05.909 --> 00:16:10.909
where we give you some statistics before we get into the really interesting things.

00:16:10.909 --> 00:16:19.909
The number of students in this class, 24, the average age, 42.8, the average

00:16:19.909 --> 00:16:28.909
years baptized, 26.5, the average years in full-time service, 19.4, the average

00:16:28.909 --> 00:16:34.909
years in special full-time service, 14.4. And then the number of languages spoken

00:16:34.909 --> 00:16:42.909
by the 24 students, 17. That's very interesting. Another interesting feature

00:16:42.909 --> 00:16:49.909
to our program today is that we have for the first time the opportunity to find

00:16:49.909 --> 00:16:55.909
out how many are tied in with the live stream on JW stream. So we can actually

00:16:55.909 --> 00:17:00.909
give you some idea of how many were listening live to the program. And we

00:17:00.909 --> 00:17:05.910
thank those that are tied in for taking the time to put in the attendance

00:17:05.910 --> 00:17:13.910
figures. So first of all, from Canada, Bethel, we had 398 in attendance.

00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:20.910
The United States, Bethel, including remote offices, we had 5,463.

00:17:20.910 --> 00:17:33.910
Then live audience via JW stream, 42,558 in 132 countries.

00:17:33.910 --> 00:17:48.910
So that makes for a total of 48,419. Probably most of us on the program are so glad

00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:55.279
we didn't know so many were listening. We have some greetings from near and

00:17:55.279 --> 00:18:00.279
far, just quickly to go through some of the comments. The Australasia branch

00:18:00.279 --> 00:18:06.279
send their warmest love and Christian greetings. The Benin branch refers to

00:18:06.279 --> 00:18:12.279
Isaiah, chapter 26, verse 12. And there they quote Jehovah saying everything we

00:18:12.279 --> 00:18:17.279
have, sorry, not Jehovah, but the Israelites saying everything we have done,

00:18:17.279 --> 00:18:22.279
you have accomplished for us. And that captures the thought, doesn't it? Britain

00:18:22.279 --> 00:18:27.279
mentions how the students will have beautiful memories and new friendships that

00:18:27.279 --> 00:18:32.279
will continue on and they'll treasure for many years. Central African Republic

00:18:32.279 --> 00:18:39.279
expresses their deepest gratitude because for the first time a couple from the

00:18:39.279 --> 00:18:44.279
Central African Republic has been able to attend Gilead. The Czech Slovak branch

00:18:44.279 --> 00:18:50.279
had 115 Bethelites there, send their love and greetings, the Dominican Republic,

00:18:50.279 --> 00:18:58.279
France, Haiti, Japan, Kazakhstan, the list goes on and on. Mozambique, Peru,

00:18:58.279 --> 00:19:06.279
the Philippines, Senegal, South Africa, Spain, Turkey, and also our brothers

00:19:06.279 --> 00:19:12.279
in Ukraine. Let me read what they say. As you put your increased knowledge and

00:19:12.279 --> 00:19:18.279
strengthening face to work, you will certainly prove to be a source of great

00:19:18.279 --> 00:19:24.279
comfort to your fellow believers and your assignments. This is all important in

00:19:24.279 --> 00:19:30.279
these very last days of the system of things. As we have witnessed in our branch

00:19:30.279 --> 00:19:36.279
territory in the recent months of the ongoing war, we wish you Jehovah's rich

00:19:36.279 --> 00:19:48.960
blessing. Don't we appreciate those greetings? Now we've got to the point

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:53.960
where we have the opportunity to present the diplomas and brother David

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:59.960
Schaefer, help it to the teaching committee is here with his high-pressure job

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:05.960
and he has the very interesting assignment of naming the families who,

00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:10.960
the brothers and sisters, some of them have a little difficult names to pronounce,

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:15.960
but I'm sure you'll be good Dave. And then he has to give me the envelope

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:20.960
to pass on. So handing over to you. So first we have Brother and Sister

00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:24.960
Ischi. They'll return to the Turkey branch. Brother Ischi has been appointed

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:37.519
to serve on the branch committee. Brother and Sister Matoška will return to

00:20:37.519 --> 00:20:48.500
the Czech Slovak branch. Brother and Sister Mkumukely will return to the

00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:59.319
South Africa branch. Brother Wade Drago will return to the Benin branch.

00:20:59.319 --> 00:21:14.980
Brother and Sister Pelyas will return to the Peru branch. Brother and Sister

00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:18.980
Pair will return to the France branch. Brother Pair has been appointed

00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:28.480
to serve on the branch committee. Brother and Sister Piscopo will return to

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:32.480
the Australasia branch. Brother Piscopo has been appointed to serve on the branch

00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:48.170
committee. Brother Ramos will return to the United States branch. Brother

00:21:48.170 --> 00:21:52.170
and Sister Salvador will return to the Mozambique branch. Brother Salvador

00:21:52.170 --> 00:22:02.349
has been appointed to serve on the branch committee. Brother and Sister Sohnto

00:22:02.349 --> 00:22:06.349
will return to the Benin branch. Brother Sohnto has been appointed to serve

00:22:06.349 --> 00:22:15.809
to serve on the Branch Committee.

00:22:15.809 --> 00:22:18.009
Brother and sister Swach Sunt will return

00:22:18.009 --> 00:22:27.609
to the Central Africa Republic Branch.

00:22:27.609 --> 00:22:29.609
Brother and sister Swares will return

00:22:29.609 --> 00:22:42.720
to the Columbia Branch.

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:44.960
And thanks very much, Brother Schaefer,

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:51.539
who will return to Wallwick.

00:22:51.539 --> 00:22:55.660
Well, I have the pleasure now to introduce you

00:22:55.660 --> 00:23:11.680
to the graduates of the 150-second class of Gilead.

00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:14.960
And at this point, we have a letter that's going to be read

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:19.039
by Brother Jason Piscobo, who's returning to Australasia,

00:23:19.039 --> 00:23:29.230
and he's reading this letter on behalf of this class.

00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:34.269
Dear brothers of the governing body and the Bethel family,

00:23:34.269 --> 00:23:37.309
with what will I repay Jehovah for all the good

00:23:37.309 --> 00:23:39.630
that he has done for me?

00:23:39.630 --> 00:23:44.829
How fittingly these words of Psalm 116, verse 12,

00:23:44.829 --> 00:23:48.029
describe the sentiments of each one of us

00:23:48.029 --> 00:23:51.230
at the end of this wonderful journey.

00:23:51.309 --> 00:23:54.670
Our hearts are simply bursting in appreciation

00:23:54.670 --> 00:23:58.269
to our loving grand instructor, Jehovah.

00:23:58.269 --> 00:24:01.710
Prior to coming to Gilead, we strived to develop

00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:04.670
a close relationship with our Heavenly Father.

00:24:04.670 --> 00:24:07.869
However, over the past five months,

00:24:07.869 --> 00:24:12.509
our eyes have been opened even further to God's glory

00:24:12.509 --> 00:24:15.230
as we have delved into the deeper facets

00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:19.390
of his personality through the pages of his word.

00:24:19.390 --> 00:24:22.990
How fascinating it has been to see how Jehovah

00:24:22.990 --> 00:24:28.269
is not a God of random acts, but one who causes to become

00:24:28.269 --> 00:24:34.670
patiently revealing his diversified wisdom in so many ways.

00:24:34.670 --> 00:24:37.549
As we contemplate the things we have learned,

00:24:37.549 --> 00:24:40.990
our feelings are like those of Job who said,

00:24:40.990 --> 00:24:48.589
my ears have heard about you, but now I do see you with my eyes.

00:24:48.670 --> 00:24:51.549
What a privilege it has been to be instructed

00:24:51.549 --> 00:24:54.589
by you dear brothers of the governing body,

00:24:54.589 --> 00:24:58.670
your humility, modesty, unity,

00:24:58.670 --> 00:25:01.630
and deep love for Jehovah in his sheep

00:25:01.630 --> 00:25:05.869
were clearly evident in both your words and demeanor.

00:25:06.670 --> 00:25:11.309
How touching it was for us to see, although you were so busy,

00:25:11.309 --> 00:25:15.069
you selflessly took out time out of your schedules

00:25:15.069 --> 00:25:17.230
to teach and encourage us.

00:25:17.789 --> 00:25:21.869
We are convinced that Jehovah is using you dear brothers

00:25:21.869 --> 00:25:25.630
in a powerful way to direct the earthly part of his organization,

00:25:26.509 --> 00:25:30.430
and it is our prayer that he continue to provide you

00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:34.269
with his dynamic Holy Spirit to carry out your assignment.

00:25:35.950 --> 00:25:39.789
We have developed a special fondness for those selected to teach us.

00:25:40.750 --> 00:25:43.789
Their teaching did not limit itself to the classroom,

00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:48.990
like Gideon who said, watch me and do exactly what I do,

00:25:49.630 --> 00:25:52.269
they were living examples of the things they taught.

00:25:53.390 --> 00:25:56.430
Their council was always given in love,

00:25:56.430 --> 00:26:00.750
and their experiences always accompanied valuable life lessons.

00:26:01.630 --> 00:26:06.349
We love you dear brothers and will treasure the time we had with you.

00:26:07.869 --> 00:26:10.910
We also love and treasure the dear brothers and sisters

00:26:10.910 --> 00:26:12.829
of the United States Bethel family.

00:26:13.869 --> 00:26:18.269
Our training began even before ever stepping foot in the classroom.

00:26:19.069 --> 00:26:22.990
From the moment we arrived, we experienced your love and hospitality,

00:26:24.269 --> 00:26:27.630
prior to coming to Gilead, we'd heard about your love,

00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:30.910
but now we have seen and felt it.

00:26:32.109 --> 00:26:35.710
You, brothers and sisters, truly are a gift from Jehovah,

00:26:35.710 --> 00:26:38.750
and we thank you from the bottom of our hearts.

00:26:40.029 --> 00:26:42.670
Now, as we move on to our various assignments,

00:26:43.309 --> 00:26:50.029
the words of the Apostle Paul at 2 Corinthians 6-1 echo in our minds and hearts

00:26:50.029 --> 00:26:55.710
as he urged fellow Christians not to accept the undeserved kindness of God and miss its purpose.

00:26:56.910 --> 00:27:01.549
The purpose of Gilead is to strengthen and stabilize the brotherhood,

00:27:02.109 --> 00:27:04.430
and that is our determination.

00:27:05.470 --> 00:27:11.390
Like the Apostle Paul, we are determined to impart to our brothers not only the things that we

00:27:11.390 --> 00:27:19.470
have learned, but also our very selves, all to the glory and honor of our Heavenly Father, Jehovah.

00:27:20.670 --> 00:27:28.670
Please accept this expression of our warm love for you, your brothers, the 150-second class of Gilead.

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:47.039
Well, it's been a privilege to be able to come and visit you and give some lectures for your Gilead

00:27:47.039 --> 00:27:52.880
class, and I've always enjoyed it, but now I have a special privilege to speak first time

00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:59.680
to the graduates of the 150-second class. That seems an awesome thought, doesn't it?

00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:05.599
And we're glad that you made it this far. We know there's been a lot of hard work that's gone into it.

00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:13.440
So what final comments will we like to give you? We've had so many good things on the program,

00:28:13.519 --> 00:28:20.240
already today, haven't you? And even if we were a little bit overwhelmed and you were worried about

00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:24.880
certain aspects of the program, at least you can watch it on J.W. Broadcasting later

00:28:25.839 --> 00:28:31.519
and get the main points. But remember, in the beginning, we talked about the need for us to be

00:28:31.519 --> 00:28:40.799
modest, to be enthusiastic, but patient. And we remember how Jesus said a wonderful example for us in

00:28:41.759 --> 00:28:48.640
acknowledging humbly that he had an assignment and that he put that assignment first in his life.

00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:55.519
But he also showed wonderful balance, didn't he? When the Sorrow of Phoenician woman begged him to

00:28:55.519 --> 00:29:01.359
help her because of her expression of faith in accepting him as the Messiah, he was willing to

00:29:01.359 --> 00:29:09.200
be flexible. And she got what a wonderful blessing she got. And then the Roman officer,

00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:17.440
the Samaritan woman, all these people were ones who really technically weren't part of his

00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:23.920
territory and yet they got wonderful blessings because they asked especially for some help.

00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:30.000
Well, what's the lessons for us? Well, maybe before we go on to the lessons, we could think of

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:36.400
some of the other non-Isolites who gained some benefit from Jesus' ministry. Who else would you

00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:46.240
think of? What about Pontius Pilate and those in his court when he had all these discussions?

00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:53.200
Well, now I'm not telling you that Pontius Pilate benefited from it, but we do see that he had a

00:29:53.200 --> 00:30:01.279
wonderful opportunity, didn't he? Because he is a sort of person, a very violent man, a person who

00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:08.319
at the drop of a hat had someone executed and yet what do we see over and over again? He seemed to

00:30:08.319 --> 00:30:14.720
try and avoid sentencing Jesus to death. Well, we know that something impressed him. Again,

00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:19.680
is this one of the times when Jesus spoke in Greek to him or some other language? Who knows?

00:30:20.319 --> 00:30:28.000
I'm not speculating. But we do know that he was very impressed. And what about those that were

00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:36.240
there listening? There was a lot going on. Well, remember later when Jesus actually died, there was

00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:44.880
a Centurion. And the Centurion acknowledged that this was the Son of God. The study note, if you

00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:51.519
check it later, says, maybe he was there with Pontius Pilate. That makes sense, doesn't he? He was

00:30:51.519 --> 00:31:00.240
perhaps in charge of organizing this. So that man got a tremendous benefit from at least seeing

00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:07.279
Jesus and hearing his testimony. And on his right was someone who gained benefit. And then finally,

00:31:07.279 --> 00:31:11.680
what about those two Roman soldiers that witnessed the resurrection? Now, they didn't have a

00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:17.920
chance to talk to Jesus as far as we know, but they did see the angel roll back the stone. What

00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:24.240
is the impact that would have had on their lives? So thinking about these ones that we've just

00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:29.759
discussed, what do we see? Well, when you go back to your assignments, as we mentioned,

00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:36.160
there'll be the temptation to get yourself involved with everything he's going on to visit the

00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:43.119
90 islands to get a ship. No, I know you're not going to do that. But the temptation will be there

00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:50.319
to sort of see the need to help as many people as possible. But what's the point? Remember,

00:31:50.319 --> 00:31:56.240
you have an assignment. Each one of you now has a specific assignment. Put that first, be faithful,

00:31:56.960 --> 00:32:02.480
loyal to Jehovah. Apply all these things that you've not only heard in Gilead, but also in today's

00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:09.440
program. And there'll be patient. Leave it to Jehovah. Remember, it's Jehovah's work, isn't it?

00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:14.000
I remember one dear brother of the governing body made the comment once, you know, when he was

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:22.559
facing a difficult situation. He just looked and said, it's Jehovah's problem. And that's what we

00:32:22.559 --> 00:32:30.240
need to recognize. Some things we leave to Jehovah. So as you go, we wish you Jehovah's blessing.

00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:40.799
Remember, be enthusiastic. But also, be patient.
