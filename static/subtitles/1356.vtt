00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:06.370
Jehovah's people have always considered the studying of his word to be an essential part

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:08.210
of life.

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.929
God's law to Israel commanded that the King must read from the law all the days of his

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.370
life so that he may learn to fear Jehovah his God.

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:22.609
In the Mayan territories of Yucatan, Mexico, our brothers are helping people learn to

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:26.010
read God's word for themselves.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.010
People's lives change when they can finally read the Bible on their own, and more readily

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:43.750
learn to fear Jehovah their God.

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:49.909
One out of every six people on earth doesn't know how to read.

00:00:49.909 --> 00:00:59.090
Jehovah's Witnesses around the world have organized literacy classes to help such ones.

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.609
I don't like to read.

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:09.290
I used to sleep at the meetings.

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:18.849
In our territory, most people speak the Mayan language, but very few can read it.

00:01:18.849 --> 00:01:23.609
On occasion I would give a talk, and when I would cite a scripture, most of the audience

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:28.569
would look it up, but then I would see a blank stare on their face because they couldn't

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:30.290
read the text.

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:38.049
I was moved to learn how to read because I wanted to learn about Jehovah and study his

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:40.569
word the Bible.

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:45.969
So a sister came to my house to teach me.

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:50.209
Literacy classes are often conducted on an individual level.

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:56.569
After a person has had their Bible study, they can spend some time to practice reading skills.

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:03.969
When the local elders notice that there are many that can benefit from this training,

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:08.129
they can schedule a larger class at the Kingdom Hall.

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:13.169
The study material used for this purpose is the brochure, apply yourself to reading and

00:02:13.169 --> 00:02:14.169
writing.

00:02:14.169 --> 00:02:20.530
It's available in 30 languages in the Central America branch territory.

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.250
Other study materials can be used as well, as long as they help the development of the

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.610
students enrolled in the class.

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.729
And we use a board on which we write, for instance, words that are difficult to pronounce.

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:40.169
This helps in the reading of complicated words.

00:02:40.169 --> 00:02:43.530
There are some who are, well, very quick learners.

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.930
On the other hand, others go word by word, but as they practice, they start getting the

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.449
hang of it.

00:02:52.449 --> 00:03:00.370
I'm good at masonry work, but learning to read is not easy.

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.050
Reading at his age is a big challenge.

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.610
You need to understand that each student learns differently.

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.129
With some, you need to be very patient.

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:17.530
The first word I learned to write was Jehovah.

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.289
It's like this, I tell him.

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:24.169
He says it's because you're not being patient with me.

00:03:24.169 --> 00:03:28.129
Having a sense of humor is a big help in the learning process, so it's not to focus

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:31.370
on errors and mistakes.

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:37.969
Since 1946, when records began being taken in Mexico, more than 152,000 people have learned

00:03:37.969 --> 00:03:41.569
to read and write thanks to these training efforts.

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:46.050
The Secretary of Public Education in the state of Mexico has recognized the work and the

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:51.530
great help these literacy classes have been to the local citizens.

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:55.770
The skills they learn help in their day-to-day life, but also it helps them to learn more about

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:00.210
Jehovah and to be able to teach others.

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:07.289
I used to have to memorize everything I was going to say, but now I can read short scriptures

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:12.370
to people directly from the Bible.

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:17.490
As the students progress in the class, they demonstrate the words found at 1 Timothy

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:25.449
415, which says in part, so that your advancement may be plainly seen by all people.

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:30.730
And these benefits are plainly seen in the students.

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:37.370
My husband was an alcoholic, he smoked, and he used bad language, but he made big changes

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:38.689
in his life.

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:46.170
When we see that this training has been a big help, we really see these great blessings.

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:52.449
Reading helped me to get baptized.

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:57.730
Helping other people to improve their reading skills makes me feel very happy.

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:02.930
I feel great because I see on their face the joy they get from reading and understanding

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:04.170
the information.

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:09.410
Well, I've benefited so much.

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:13.970
For instance, now we read the Bible together as a family.

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:17.290
It makes me very happy.

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:19.370
We're more united as a family.

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:26.730
Our children respect my husband more like the father he is.

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:31.290
Now I'm a ministerial servant.

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:38.410
When I go preaching door to door, some people say, I don't know how to read.

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:48.410
But then I tell them, I didn't know either, but I learned about Jehovah, and you can too.

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:51.689
If I learned to read, anybody can.
