00:00:01.649 --> 00:00:06.650
We are living in a time where there is very little wholesome entertainment available for families.

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:15.650
That is why the animated videos, such as the Become Jehovah's Friend series and the Whiteboard animations, have become so popular.

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:22.649
However, are these merely entertaining videos for our children to enjoy watching over and over? No.

00:00:22.649 --> 00:00:30.649
These animations are touching the hearts of our young ones. They are drawing closer to their Heavenly Father as they learn his qualities and see his love for them.

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:35.649
In fact, we have received hundreds of letters of appreciation from them.

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:38.649
Why don't we let the children tell us how they feel?

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:41.649
Thank you for making the video about Caleb.

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:47.649
I like the way Caleb acts and plays with Jehovah. I'll try to be like him. I love Jehovah.

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:50.649
My favorite one is the new one on Courage.

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:54.649
I like it because I try to witness at school and it helps me a lot.

00:00:54.649 --> 00:01:00.649
I love how it shows kids like me that it's important to pay attention at the movies.

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:03.649
Dear brothers and sisters, I am seven years old.

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:09.650
I am very happy to send you this donation so that you can make more Caleb videos.

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.650
And I would like it if Caleb could have a winner dog named Lula.

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:21.650
I feel like when I leave the show, I think I'll go back.

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.650
Yeah, I hope so.

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.650
I wish you all the best.

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.650
I wish you all the best.

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.650
I love you so much.

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.650
I love you so much.

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.650
I love you so much.

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.650
I love you so much.

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:59.790
Because that's nice and helps them feel better.

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.790
I love you so much.

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:10.789
A player means bow your head close your eyes.

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.789
And talk to Jehovah.

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:33.840
No, don't quit.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.840
Other than that, I can forgive freely.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.840
And I'm making joy when you're happy.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:50.620
You have to keep your room neat and clean just like Jehovah.

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.620
Keep all his things clean.

00:02:54.620 --> 00:04:11.530
These videos are clearly reaching the hearts of our children.

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:17.529
They have also been very effective in the ministry, both formally and informally.

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:21.529
One day while we were shopping, the lady at the store said to my son,

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:23.529
don't forget the magic words.

00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:25.529
Please and thank you.

00:04:25.529 --> 00:04:27.529
No, said Benjamin.

00:04:27.529 --> 00:04:31.540
Magic is from Satan.

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.540
Please and thank you are from Caleb.

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.540
Who is Caleb, she asked?

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:40.540
Using my phone, Benjamin showed her several videos, others approached.

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:44.540
She asked how to download the videos and I showed her JW.org.

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:48.540
She wrote it down so she could show the videos to her own children.

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:53.540
In the last few years, we've been showing the whiteboard videos in the schools.

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:57.540
The police were also doing presentations in schools about bullies.

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:00.540
And so the school asked us if we had anything under subject.

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:03.540
That how to beat a bully video was perfect.

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:09.180
The teachers and the parents had very positive comments about it.

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:14.180
My daughter Cindy is diagnosed with autism, so her communication is limited.

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:17.180
When the video, Jehovah will help you be bold came out.

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.180
She watched it twice.

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:24.180
She stood up, went to get her book, learn from the great teacher, and said to me,

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:28.180
Carolina, get upset, take it, sad.

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:30.180
School.

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:42.180
The next day at school when her schoolmate arrived, Cindy gave her the book and told her,

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.180
no sad, it's from Jehovah.

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:49.180
I was surprised to see the reaction the video had on Cindy.

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:53.180
Even with her disability, my daughter was preaching.

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:59.180
I use the whiteboard animation videos as visual aids to support some of the subjects I teach,

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:03.180
such as getting along with one another and civics.

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:09.180
In a lot of schools, putting into practice moral values has really gone downhill.

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:15.620
So these videos are salvaging and inculcating real moral values.

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:19.620
What a powerful witness these are proving to be.

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:23.620
But it's not just the children who are benefiting.

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:26.620
That story, which is a light go.

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:31.620
She knew what could help him name, but she was holding back.

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:34.620
What I appreciate is that sometimes, you know, I also hold back.

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:38.620
I think of when it comes to certain aspects of the ministry.

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:42.620
It's quite nerve-wracking to be able to approach a business territory.

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:50.620
So what motivates me to do now is to see how I can take a great advantage of that part of the ministry.

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:53.620
Like what was shown in the video, praying.

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:58.620
I pray to Jehovah, ask him to be bold to take the fear out of your heart as it were.

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:00.620
And then prepare my presentation.

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:03.620
Do everything I can on my part.

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:11.120
And then go for it.

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:17.120
And I become Jehovah's friend video.

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:23.120
It shows a good role model for us regarding discipline.

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:28.120
The animated video I found most practical for us as a newly married couple

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:31.120
is the one entitled Be Social Network Smart.

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:35.120
There's some very practical advice about the use of time,

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:40.120
as well as the dangers associated with social media and social network.

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:50.519
So we applied the counsel from the video to not let our online life get in the way of our real life.

00:07:50.519 --> 00:07:57.519
There are things I can learn from the video, from Caleb and Sophia's parents.

00:07:58.519 --> 00:08:04.519
When they discipline their children, they always use the Bible.

00:08:04.519 --> 00:08:12.519
It is beneficial for all the people, not only for children.

00:08:12.519 --> 00:08:19.519
One thing we've learned from Sophia is to prepare for full service before going out.

00:08:19.519 --> 00:08:22.519
That pen that Sophia had was very nice.

00:08:22.519 --> 00:08:24.519
I had a butterfly, I really like it.

00:08:24.519 --> 00:08:27.519
I wouldn't mind getting one of those for myself.

00:08:27.519 --> 00:08:36.519
As we have seen, these animated videos are powerful tools that reach hearts and change lives.

00:08:36.519 --> 00:08:43.519
What a gift from Jehovah, yet another way all can come to know and love him more fully.

00:08:43.519 --> 00:08:46.519
How do these videos make you feel?

00:08:46.519 --> 00:08:51.519
I feel really touched when I watch these videos.

00:08:52.519 --> 00:09:00.519
It's just over how can you tell the organizers and such good ideas for the children around the world

00:09:00.519 --> 00:09:06.519
and for me to know all about these things that you have taught us.

00:09:06.519 --> 00:09:08.519
It's so amazing.

00:09:10.519 --> 00:09:18.519
I always thank Jehovah and the governing body for making these wonderful videos for children.

00:09:18.519 --> 00:09:21.519
Thank you, Jehovah, so much.

00:09:23.519 --> 00:09:35.519
Jehovah, God, please help us make more Caleb and Sophia videos because my whole family really loved them and me.

00:09:35.519 --> 00:09:39.519
Isaiah 30 verses 20 and 21 says in part,

00:09:39.519 --> 00:09:45.519
you will see your grand instructor with your own eyes and your own ears will hear a word saying,

00:09:45.519 --> 00:09:48.519
this is the way, walking it.

00:09:48.519 --> 00:09:56.519
Yes, with our own eyes and ears, we are learning from our grand instructor in unique and delightful ways.
