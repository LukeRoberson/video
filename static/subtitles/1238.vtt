Jehovah loves children, and he has shown this by providing help and guidance for them down to our day.

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:18.230
For example, at the 1978 Victoria's Faith International Convention, this release entitled My Book of Bible Stories

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.230
was soon treasured by young ones around the world.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:29.230
Over the years, it's helped millions to come to love Jehovah and become his faithful worshippers.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.479
The story that always meant a lot to me was that of Samson, especially the images that we had in the My Book of Bible Stories

00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:40.479
that were so vivid to see the strength that Jehovah gave him and the way he supported him.

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:46.479
But at the same time, the story always carried that if you were no beating to Jehovah, you lost that blessing and that strength.

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:51.479
So I think it's a young one growing up in the truth, especially when you went to school and you had to stand out and be different

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:55.479
to remember that Jehovah could support you and give you that kind of extraordinary strength.

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:59.479
It gave you the power that you needed to make that stand.

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:07.480
Even earlier, the watch tower began a series of articles that became the basis for the book listening to the great teacher.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:13.480
And later, that was rewritten and re-illostrated to become learn from the great teacher.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.480
The totals is what kind of qualities and friends you'd have.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:24.480
I like chapters 35 called We Can Wake Up From Just because I used to be afraid and now I know that Jesus will resurrect us no matter what.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.480
And so I'm not afraid anymore.

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:35.480
In 2006, The Awake magazine started including numerous activities and puzzles for children of various ages.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:50.480
JW.org expanded on this content to include over 40 Bible character cards, illustrated Bible stories, games, coloring activities, and two series entitled My Bible Lessons for Younger Children,

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.480
and teach your children for those slightly older.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:01.480
And who can forget to become Jehovah's Friend video series with Caleb and Sophia?

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.480
The video helped me to be bold for Jehovah.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:10.479
There's this little booklet, Sash Magazine, called My Bible Lessons that I remember when I was younger.

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:16.479
Things to be thankful about, like the paradise and what Jehovah gave us and friends.

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:21.479
But what has Jehovah provided for teens and teens?

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:29.479
In the early 70s, articles were written to help those in this age group to cope with the challenges of becoming an adult.

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:40.479
These later became the basis for the books Your Youth Getting The Best Out of It, and more recently, questions young people ask, answers that work.

00:02:40.479 --> 00:03:00.479
Add to that the ever expanding online content, such as answers to 10 questions young people ask, the video series, what your peers say, as well as whiteboard animations and feature length films designed to tackle serious and sometimes emotional subjects.

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:05.479
When I was in middle school, I used to be bullied and it was harsh.

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:11.479
Once that video came out, I mean, how was this amazing? It felt like Jehovah was literally talking to me.

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:24.259
Yes, Jehovah loves young ones, and he continues to express that love with an abundance of wonderful gifts.

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:35.259
People of all ages, but especially young ones, will enjoy this new 240 page book containing 103 lessons.

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:45.259
The artwork is new and has been extensively researched, bringing the Bible to life and capturing the feelings of those depicted.

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:53.259
Parents will appreciate that each section starts with a preview of the key lessons you can emphasize.

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:59.259
Each lesson includes review questions and a caption scripture that summarizes it.

00:03:59.259 --> 00:04:07.259
For example, the caption scripture for the lesson Hannah prays for a son is Matthew 7, verse 7.

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:13.259
Keep on asking and it will be given you. Keep on seeking and you will find.

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:23.259
This scripture serves as the main theme of this account, allowing you to help your child focus on the key lesson of the story.

00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:35.259
Our hope is that all ages will enjoy this gift from our loving Father Jehovah as we all discover new lessons we can learn from the Bible.
