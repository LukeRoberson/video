00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:07.129
This book of the law should not depart from your mouth,

00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:11.130
and you must read it in an undertone day and night

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.130
in order to observe carefully all that is written in it,

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:18.129
for then your way will be successful,

00:00:18.129 --> 00:00:22.129
and then you will act wisely.

00:00:22.129 --> 00:00:26.129
The Bible is enjoyed in many different formats,

00:00:26.129 --> 00:00:33.270
one of which is the audio edition of the New World Translation.

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.270
The news, according to Matthew.

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.270
But how is it produced?

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.270
Let's take a closer look.

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.270
When we first heard that the governing body wanted

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.270
to record the revised edition of the New World Translation,

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.270
I think all of us knew that it was going to be a big job.

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.270
The narrator is one voice,

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:59.840
and all the other characters are a different voice.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.840
It's not a dramatic Bible reading,

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.840
but it's a reading with a high level of realism.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.840
There's no music, no sound effects, just voices.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.840
We were surprised to find out how many characters

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.840
there were in the Bible. Well, the Bible is a really big book.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.840
I don't think any of us realized how big of a job it would be.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.840
This is not a little project. This is huge.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.209
The research really is one of the items

00:01:27.209 --> 00:01:30.209
that are a very fundamental basic.

00:01:30.209 --> 00:01:33.209
They are very important to get the facts together.

00:01:33.209 --> 00:01:36.209
The Bible is true life,

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:38.209
but it's what really happened to real people.

00:01:38.209 --> 00:01:42.209
We had to break down who the voices were.

00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:46.209
And then we had to give each character a unique name to identify him.

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:48.209
If he's not named in the Bible,

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:50.209
we have to just give them descriptions

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:54.209
that are in the context like third Jew or first in the crowd.

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:58.209
We're given a room, a fair-sized room,

00:01:58.209 --> 00:02:01.209
and we used it to make a list

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:04.209
of all of the characters in all four gospels.

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:07.209
We began with a book of Matthew,

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:11.210
and we had to determine the parallel accounts

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.210
between the different gospel writers.

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.210
You'll have to use the same voice for a character.

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.210
If he appears in one book,

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.210
he needs to be the same character in the other books.

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:22.210
Like in Matthew 21,

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:26.210
we have this report where Matthew simply says,

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:28.210
well, the disciples said,

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:30.210
the fig tree has with it.

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.210
But who are the disciples?

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:34.210
Did they all say it at the same time?

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:36.210
So if you check in Mark, for example,

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.210
Mark is very specific.

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:41.210
He says, Peter said the fig tree has with it.

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:45.210
The art department took those maps and charts in the appendix

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:48.210
and blew them up into poster size for us

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:51.210
as we were deciding who said what and where they were

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:53.210
and how to name the characters.

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:55.210
It was very helpful to have that.

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:57.210
What kind of attributes they have,

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.210
age, where they were from,

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:04.210
what kind of traits they were expressing in their quotations?

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:08.210
When the Bible talks about Jehovah speaking,

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:11.210
well, was it really Jehovah himself who spoke?

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:15.210
Well, something we know that at least at three occasions

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:17.210
it was Jehovah who spoke.

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:18.210
This was when Jesus was on earth.

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:20.210
We compiled most of the research

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:23.210
and then it was forwarded on to writing research.

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:26.210
We have a large library here in Bethel

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:30.210
that is focusing especially on biblical subjects.

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.210
And we are using this quite a bit

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:35.210
because we need to make sure that what we say is solid.

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:38.210
We are people for Jehovah

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:41.210
and everything we say is based on the Bible.

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:44.210
We don't want to read too much into Bible accounts

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:48.210
and we don't want to read it in a way that steers incorrectly.

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:54.030
Because so many voices were needed for the project,

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.030
we realized that we wouldn't be able to restrict ourselves

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.030
to using just readers at Patterson

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.030
where our audio video studios are.

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.030
So we didn't really have a good place anymore in Brooklyn

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.030
but we wanted some place close to the governing body.

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.030
New York City is a very noisy place.

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.030
So we hunted all over the buildings.

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:15.030
We finally found in the basement of the 25 Columbia Heights

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.029
building a quiet place.

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:19.029
That's where we are right now.

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:24.730
We are in the underground to start with, who's in Bethel?

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:27.730
We have an audition bank here in an audio video.

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:29.730
We poured through hundreds of auditions.

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:31.730
We had a brother from Africa.

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:33.730
We got audition over the internet.

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:35.730
He's sitting there reading into a mic.

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:37.730
I'm watching him.

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:41.730
By the time we tallied all of the characters for the entire Bible,

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:44.730
we realized we had about a thousand characters.

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:47.730
So a thousand voices that will need to find

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:53.779
there was a reading seminar at which we were taught

00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:56.779
about every aspect of reading.

00:04:56.779 --> 00:04:59.779
And that was very effective because it reminded us

00:04:59.779 --> 00:05:03.779
of a lot of things, do's and don'ts for effective reading.

00:05:03.779 --> 00:05:05.779
It really gave me the confidence and understanding that

00:05:05.779 --> 00:05:07.779
but I think I can do this.

00:05:07.779 --> 00:05:09.779
Some of the roles are very small.

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:12.779
Those short, very short passages,

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:18.779
those one sentence lines that we would call a person in for

00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:21.779
were some of the hardest to coach.

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:25.779
When I initially was asked to participate in the Bible reading,

00:05:25.779 --> 00:05:27.779
I was so excited.

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:29.779
And then I thought it was one line and I thought,

00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:31.779
okay, well, it won't be too bad.

00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:32.779
It'll be easy.

00:05:32.779 --> 00:05:35.779
And then so I listened to the Bible reading seminar

00:05:35.779 --> 00:05:39.779
and really helped me to take it more seriously.

00:05:39.779 --> 00:05:42.779
We would even ask the readers to study this over.

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:47.779
You only have one sentence, but study all about this character.

00:05:47.779 --> 00:05:49.779
I read the chapter.

00:05:49.779 --> 00:05:53.779
I read the insight book and I realized that this is

00:05:53.779 --> 00:05:56.779
more than just saying one line.

00:05:56.779 --> 00:06:00.779
What we have found is that it's a good idea to provide the reader

00:06:00.779 --> 00:06:03.779
with a script that has been customized.

00:06:03.779 --> 00:06:05.779
I have the word written out phonetically so that you know

00:06:05.779 --> 00:06:07.779
better how to pronounce it.

00:06:07.779 --> 00:06:08.779
I would say Solomon.

00:06:08.779 --> 00:06:10.779
Solomon, who's he?

00:06:10.779 --> 00:06:11.779
That kind of thing.

00:06:11.779 --> 00:06:14.779
So anyway, they help you pronounce Solomon.

00:06:14.779 --> 00:06:18.779
And they were very careful to make the pronunciation was accurate

00:06:18.779 --> 00:06:21.779
and it would be consistent and accurate all the way

00:06:21.779 --> 00:06:24.779
through the Bible reading from begin to end.

00:06:24.779 --> 00:06:31.079
Every morning, we prepare the studio for recording.

00:06:31.079 --> 00:06:33.079
We'll go in, turn on the lights, turn on all the equipment,

00:06:33.079 --> 00:06:36.079
make sure that we have water, hot and cold for the reader.

00:06:36.079 --> 00:06:38.079
One of the things we learn in the seminar was the importance

00:06:38.079 --> 00:06:40.079
of staying hydrated.

00:06:40.079 --> 00:06:44.079
Sometimes we can use vinegar or honey, a little bit of lemon.

00:06:44.079 --> 00:06:46.079
So when the character comes in, we try to help them

00:06:46.079 --> 00:06:48.079
to kind of think about the context.

00:06:48.079 --> 00:06:51.079
Of course, they've already done that in their own research and practice.

00:06:51.079 --> 00:06:54.079
But a little bit more about maybe the motive of the character.

00:06:54.079 --> 00:06:57.079
How would they have felt in this particular instance?

00:06:57.079 --> 00:06:59.079
How would they say this line?

00:06:59.079 --> 00:07:02.079
But we also want to make sure that brothers and sisters feel really comfortable.

00:07:02.079 --> 00:07:07.079
And it often takes a long time to get them to relax.

00:07:07.079 --> 00:07:13.079
In the control room, there are basically three roles and the reader.

00:07:13.079 --> 00:07:17.079
The follower is responsible to make sure that all of the content is there.

00:07:17.079 --> 00:07:19.079
To make sure that no words are missing.

00:07:19.079 --> 00:07:27.079
During the recording, the audio engineer is listening for anything that will distract the listeners, stomach noises or shirt noise.

00:07:27.079 --> 00:07:29.079
If the brother is wearing suspenders.

00:07:29.079 --> 00:07:32.079
The coach is responsible for the quality of teaching.

00:07:32.079 --> 00:07:36.079
I love watching the coach try to get the right emotion out of the reader.

00:07:36.079 --> 00:07:40.079
So then you might read a line and he'll say, can you say that again with a smile?

00:07:40.079 --> 00:07:43.079
And it's amazing because then it sounds more joyful.

00:07:43.079 --> 00:07:46.079
And then once you capture the emotion, then it naturally comes out.

00:07:46.079 --> 00:07:49.079
You're not trying to copy what he's told you to say.

00:07:49.079 --> 00:07:54.079
What we have usually a person do is start with one emotion that you're sad.

00:07:54.079 --> 00:07:57.079
And then add each emotion on top.

00:07:57.079 --> 00:08:02.079
That ends up getting a very complex delivery of a line.

00:08:02.079 --> 00:08:05.079
There's so many possible ways to say one line.

00:08:05.079 --> 00:08:11.079
I didn't even realize how many you think you know how the character said it.

00:08:11.079 --> 00:08:14.079
And then the coach will give you a suggestion.

00:08:14.079 --> 00:08:18.079
The Bible, of course, is filled with all different kinds of personalities.

00:08:18.079 --> 00:08:21.079
And the Bible is full of bad characters.

00:08:21.079 --> 00:08:26.079
When I got my assignment and found out what I was supposed to read,

00:08:26.079 --> 00:08:33.080
I really stopped because at Bethel and with everybody else, we're supposed to be encouraging to other people.

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:40.080
And here is a fella who is talking disrespectfully to Jehovah.

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:44.080
And I had to stop and think.

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:47.080
These brothers were all mature Christian men.

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:52.080
They had their personalities refined for years and years, this new personality.

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:58.080
To make those expressions the way they were by these contrary critters,

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:01.080
you had to think and put your heart into it.

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:03.080
And sometimes when I pushed it a little too much, they said,

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:05.080
come on, cool little, little bit.

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:07.080
That's not exactly what we want.

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:14.080
But I tried to be the bad guy when I was supposed to be.

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:21.500
So the editing process actually begins during the recording.

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:24.500
And then when we get done recording, perhaps a chapter,

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:27.500
we'll take down the best takes of every verse

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:30.500
because the reader and the coach can then listen back and see,

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:31.500
okay, do we like how it sounds?

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:34.500
We use professional software to do the editing.

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:36.500
And that means we do all the spacing that's needed.

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:38.500
We pull in all the characters for a specific chapter

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:41.500
because we record each voice individually.

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:44.500
It's not a group of people around the microphone having the conversation.

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:46.500
So each character is done.

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:49.500
And then if there's multiple voices in a chapter,

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:51.500
then we pull them all together.

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:54.500
Once we started editing together these chapters,

00:09:54.500 --> 00:10:01.500
beautiful artwork of truth is you're seeing like the context jump out

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:06.500
and for us to then feel it and move us as, you know,

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:09.500
the reader of God's Word, here of God's Word.

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:16.679
The comment I've heard over and over again is,

00:10:16.679 --> 00:10:21.679
it's brought the Bible to life in my mind and heart.

00:10:21.679 --> 00:10:28.679
And it has encouraged us to meditate deeper into God's Word.

00:10:28.679 --> 00:10:32.679
Having the different characters read the voices

00:10:32.679 --> 00:10:35.679
is going to be such a comfort to all of us.

00:10:35.679 --> 00:10:39.679
I think that this is really going to make Bible reading exciting.

00:10:39.679 --> 00:10:44.679
So now the Bible is alive and what a difference it makes.

00:10:44.679 --> 00:10:46.679
I think they're going to love it.
