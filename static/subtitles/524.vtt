00:00:01.679 --> 00:00:08.279
With these two words for our text today, Jehovah brought Tabitha and Dorcas back to life.

00:00:08.279 --> 00:00:15.679
And as our commenters also pointed out, the resurrection of the dead has to be one of the most amazing miracles

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:17.679
I mentioned in the Bible.

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:22.679
The restoration of a human body or the formation of a new body,

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:28.179
and then the putting of the memories and everything that was that person back into it,

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:34.679
is just an amazing demonstration of the power of chemistry and biology and physics,

00:00:34.679 --> 00:00:42.679
what Jehovah understands about life in the universe in a way that just is amazing to us.

00:00:42.679 --> 00:00:49.179
Of course, we're amazed by modern technology, maybe smartphones and computers and modern medicine,

00:00:49.179 --> 00:00:54.679
but those things pale in comparison when we think about the power and understanding

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:59.179
that it takes for Jehovah to resurrect a human being.

00:00:59.179 --> 00:01:06.680
In fact, for many people, the idea of the resurrection of the dead really seems far-fetched.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:12.680
Maybe the stuff of science fiction, or maybe they may even think it's just a wishful thinking.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:21.680
So how can we build our faith and confidence in the resurrection and help others to have faith and confidence in this wonderful hope as well?

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.680
Well, we'll discuss just a couple of ways.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:32.680
First, we can reason it out by meditating on Jehovah's creative power and who he is.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:39.680
Let's consider a couple of examples of men that reasoned that Jehovah must be capable of the resurrection,

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.680
even though there hadn't been any resurrections up to that point.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.680
Let's consider Abraham.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.680
If we look at Hebrews chapter 11 and verse 19,

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:58.680
when Jehovah had asked him to offer up Isaac his son as a sacrifice, notice how he reasoned.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:05.680
Hebrews 11.19, but he reasoned that God was able to raise him up even from the dead,

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.680
and he did receive him from there in an illustrative way.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:15.680
Yes, Abraham was able to reason on the fact that Jehovah was the creator

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.680
and the fact that he had restored Sarah's reproductive power.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.680
He had resurrected basically her ability to have children.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:30.680
He concluded that even if he should follow through with sacrificing Isaac,

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.680
that Jehovah could and would bring him back from the dead.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.680
Well, that knowledge certainly would have strengthened him

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:44.680
and strengthened his resolve to do something that must have been an extremely difficult thing to ask a father

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.680
to put basically his son to death.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:57.680
But that hope, that strength of resolve that he had was bolstered by the fact that he understood Jehovah could bring him back from the dead.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.680
He reasoned on it.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.680
Or Job, he believed in the resurrection.

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.680
Job 14, 14 and 15.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.680
Notice how Job reasons on Jehovah's capability.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.680
Job 14, 14 and 15.

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.680
If a man dies, can he live again?

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:23.680
I will wait all the days of my compulsory service until my relief comes.

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.680
You will call, and I will answer you.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.680
You will long for the work of your hands.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:38.680
So we keep in mind that Job wrote these words after the death of his attend children.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:44.680
Now the pain and suffering of having just one child die for parents is a really tragic.

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:50.680
But ten children, that's an unbelievable burden of grief.

00:03:50.680 --> 00:04:00.680
But Job reasoned that if he, as their father, missed his ten children so much that he was sure that Jehovah

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.680
also longed for them and missed them as well.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:15.680
Even though he had ten more children later, we can be sure that Job was looking forward to seeing his other dead lost children in the resurrection.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:24.680
Now that's the first way of just reasoning on Jehovah's capability knowing who he is and understanding that he has the capability to perform resurrection.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.680
The second way is reading accounts of actual resurrection in the Bible.

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.680
Elijah resurrected a child.

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.680
Elijah resurrected a child.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.680
Elijah resurrected a man even after he was dead.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.680
A man got thrown on his dead bones and got resurrected.

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:53.680
Jesus resurrected the widow of name's son, a gerious daughter, and then also Jesus resurrected Lazarus.

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.680
And then we have Jehovah resurrecting Jesus.

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:05.680
And then we have Peter resurrecting Tabitha or Dorcas in our text for today and then Paul resurrecting Young Uticus.

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.680
Now if we look at these resurrections, we learn several things from them.

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:15.680
Some children were resurrected, which is certainly comforting for parents who lost children.

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.680
Some older ones, Tabitha and Lazarus.

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:26.680
One resurrection was done by dead bones. The prophet even wasn't there, so no one could claim he worked that one out.

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:38.680
So the purpose of the miracles of the resurrection recorded in the Bible was to really build faith that Job and Jesus can and will perform resurrections.

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:43.680
I really like the way the Apostle Paul says in Acts chapter 17 and verse 31,

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:49.680
that Jesus' resurrection provided a guarantee to all men.

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:54.680
It's like recording those resurrections in the Bible, Jehovah is saying,

00:05:54.680 --> 00:06:01.680
I guarantee you I can do this. Not only could you reason on it, but I'm demonstrating that I can do this.

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:05.680
See, if death is really like the pause button on a remote,

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:13.680
the resurrection by Jehovah is like him pressing the play button to resume their life.

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:24.680
So we can reason on the fact that Jehovah has the creative ability and the ability like Abraham and Job did to perform resurrections,

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:28.680
and we can read about the actual resurrections that Jehovah performed.

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:34.680
Both of us give us knowledge and faith in the resurrection.

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:39.680
But how does knowledge and faith in the resurrection hope actually help us today?

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:43.680
Well, knowledge gives us power and strength and courage.

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:49.680
To illustrate, one day as a young boy I was out in the field ministry and I was going up to a door,

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:57.680
and this ferocious dog came from out of nowhere just teeth and all coming right at me and I ran from my life.

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:04.680
And I got a little ways from him and I hear this thunk and I realized, ah, that sounds like a chain.

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:08.680
I turned around and sure enough, he's chained right there. He couldn't go any further.

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:20.680
Well, now with the knowledge that he's chained and can't go any further, I could walk so my courageously up to the door and I give my presentation.

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:28.680
See Satan snarls, he barks, he threatens, but in the end Jehovah limits him like a strong chain what he can do.

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:36.680
I mean, even if Satan succeeds in killing us before the end of this system or we die before the end of this old system,

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:39.680
Jehovah gives us the hope of the resurrection.

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:47.680
He lets us know that ferocious death cannot cause us or our loved ones any permanent harm.

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:59.680
Any harm caused by death is temporary. It's like that pause on the remote and Jehovah can easily just press play.

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:04.680
Today's text is only two words, but it has tremendous power.

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:07.680
I want you to try this and see how it makes you feel.

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:18.680
Instead of today's text saying, Tabitha rise, I'd like you to put the name of a person you really want to see back in the resurrection alive once more.

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:29.680
And here Jesus say, your mother's name, rise, your father, rise, your beloved husband or wife, rise.

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:36.679
Our texts for today may only be two words, but what hope and courage they give us.
