00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:07.490
Well, obviously our text today deals with the refreshing way that Jehovah deals with us and

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:11.730
While I was researching this I came across a

00:00:12.689 --> 00:00:20.690
Unwatched our article. It was back in 1998 and it covered the subject of respecting and dignifying others and being

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:22.769
refreshing to them

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:29.250
But it was sobering because on the very first page of that article there was a picture of a slave ship and

00:00:29.969 --> 00:00:33.329
And I wondered, well, why is that there? Well, the article commented

00:00:34.049 --> 00:00:40.289
The slave trade was among the darkest episodes and man's inhumane treatment of his fellow man

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:48.689
One of the most egregious examples of man stripping another man of his personal dignity and respect

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:52.130
Not refreshing at all

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.369
stripping a person of dignity and respect is devastating

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.049
But the interesting thing is that though the atrocities connected with the slave trade

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.170
are abolished in most lands

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.969
Well the stripping of human dignity it still exists today, but it's just more subtle

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:20.209
The world is ruled by Satan the devil and he wants nothing more than to put us on that ship

00:01:20.849 --> 00:01:24.129
stripping us of our personal dignity and respect

00:01:24.849 --> 00:01:29.090
Many of our brothers and sisters who work secularly they have to deal with this every day

00:01:30.209 --> 00:01:33.250
Some of our brothers are persecuted around the world

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.450
Satan tries to strip them of their dignity

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:42.370
He takes our loved ones away from us so that we feel lost and hopeless

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:49.569
And through sickness and old age and other unpleasant human experiences

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:54.049
He tries to make us feel worthless and unwanted

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.489
He wants to strip us of every ounce of dignity that we have

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.969
Not at all to be refreshing

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:06.370
And that's why our text today is so refreshing

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:15.090
Note the contrast of how Jehovah and his organization treat us and how we feel as result of that treatment

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:21.250
If you're still in Deuteronomy 32, let's read verse 2 in its entirety

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:26.930
It says my instruction will fall as the rain

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.689
My words will trickle as the dew

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.610
As gentle rains upon grass and as copious showers upon vegetation

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:39.569
That's refreshing

00:02:39.889 --> 00:02:42.129
Do is a pretty amazing thing

00:02:43.169 --> 00:02:45.169
It's an atmospheric phenomenon

00:02:45.969 --> 00:02:51.650
Jehovah has designed the atmosphere so that when it cools during the night under certain conditions

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:54.770
It reaches what is known as the dew point

00:02:55.889 --> 00:03:01.409
This is the temperature at which the air can no longer hold onto its moisture

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:07.729
And so it deposits it onto surfaces that are cooler than the surrounding air

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:11.169
One article said this about dew

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:21.009
In a way it seems as if the greenery has shed tears of joy in greeting the sunrise

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:23.889
That's pretty refreshing

00:03:23.969 --> 00:03:29.650
And isn't that a beautiful word picture of how Jehovah refreshes us with his word

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:36.689
As these gentle principles permeate and penetrate our mind and heart

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:41.490
You know Jesus is a perfect reflection of his father Jehovah

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:47.409
And Jesus extended to us a very refreshing invitation familiar to us

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:49.729
It's recorded in Matthew 11

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:51.729
28 and 29

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:53.250
You remember it

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:54.689
Jesus says

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:56.689
Come to me

00:03:56.689 --> 00:03:57.729
Come to me

00:03:57.729 --> 00:04:01.090
All who are toiling and loaded down

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.490
And I will refresh you

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:07.330
Take my yoke upon you and learn from me

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.449
For I am mild tempered and lowly in heart

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:14.370
And you will find refreshment for yourselves

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.170
For my yoke is kindly and my load is light

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:20.850
So when we feel distressed

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:22.610
Jesus says

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:24.290
Come to him

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:26.689
Jesus says I will refresh you

00:04:26.689 --> 00:04:27.730
And in fact

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:29.009
Jesus is saying

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:32.290
Let me take you for a walk in the dew

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:36.209
So that you can find the refreshment that you need

00:04:37.089 --> 00:04:41.490
Now there are an abundance of examples of how Jesus refreshed others

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:43.810
One of the most touching to me

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:49.889
Was the example of when Peter encountered Jesus

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:52.290
After

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:54.449
His denial of Jesus

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:56.449
It's a familiar examples

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:59.970
But it touches me because you can empathize with Peter

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:02.610
Sometimes

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.850
I have said and done some of the

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:07.810
Dumbest things

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:09.089
But you can't take it back

00:05:09.089 --> 00:05:11.810
You can't change it right away

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:13.730
And no doubt Peter felt that way

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:15.089
When he denied Jesus

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:18.689
That account is recorded in Matthew chapter 26

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:22.290
Jesus was of course reaching the end of his life on earth

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:24.370
And he was providing his disciples

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:27.569
And his apostles with some excellent counsel and admonition

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:31.329
And chapter 26 verse 31

00:05:31.329 --> 00:05:33.329
He tells them that they're all going to stumble

00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:35.009
In fact

00:05:35.009 --> 00:05:37.490
It's prophesied that this is going to happen

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:40.129
But Peter says in verse 33

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:41.329
Oh no

00:05:41.329 --> 00:05:42.610
Oh no not me Lord

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:45.649
It made these others might stumble but not me

00:05:45.649 --> 00:05:47.410
Oh no not that will never happen

00:05:48.689 --> 00:05:50.769
Well Jesus says in verse 34

00:05:50.769 --> 00:05:53.410
Truly I say to you on this night

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:54.610
Peter

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:56.050
Before rooster crows

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:58.449
You will disown me three times

00:05:59.649 --> 00:06:00.689
But Peter says oh no

00:06:00.689 --> 00:06:02.209
Verse 35 oh no

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:04.209
Even if I die

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:06.610
I will never disown you

00:06:07.649 --> 00:06:08.769
Well, we know what happened

00:06:09.649 --> 00:06:12.209
And the account says in verse 75

00:06:12.209 --> 00:06:13.970
That after Peter's denial

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:16.610
He went outside and wept bitterly

00:06:17.089 --> 00:06:18.449
Peter was depressed

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:20.449
And there's no evidence

00:06:21.089 --> 00:06:23.089
That Peter ever had a chance

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:26.290
To explain himself before Jesus passed away

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:29.490
No doubt in his mind

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:32.209
He wondered would Jesus ever forgive me

00:06:32.769 --> 00:06:33.569
For what I did

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:36.529
Peter was so depressed

00:06:37.329 --> 00:06:38.370
Was he able to eat

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:40.930
Was he able to sleep

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:46.610
Did he want to go on living with this on his conscience

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:47.649
Conscience

00:06:47.649 --> 00:06:50.290
This was no doubt one of the lowest points

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:52.209
In Peter's life

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:54.209
And you can be sure

00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:58.129
That Satan was doing his best

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:00.930
To put his foot on Peter's neck

00:07:01.569 --> 00:07:05.089
And choke all the everlasting life out of him

00:07:06.209 --> 00:07:08.769
He sought to strip him of all of his hope

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:11.009
All of his dignity

00:07:11.009 --> 00:07:13.009
All of his respect

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:15.810
Well a few days later Peter's sadness

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:20.129
Melt's away because Jesus appears before the apostles

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:22.850
But Jesus did something first

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:25.089
Very touching and very private

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:28.689
First Corinthians 15 5 mentions

00:07:29.009 --> 00:07:32.290
That Jesus appeared to seaface or Peter

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:34.449
First then to the 12

00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:37.730
So Jesus appeared to Peter

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:41.089
Evidently when Peter was all alone

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:43.970
Picture that for just a moment

00:07:45.329 --> 00:07:47.649
Picture that refreshing encounter

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:50.930
The details of that reunion

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:52.850
Have not been recorded for us

00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:55.810
They're left between Jesus and Peter

00:07:57.170 --> 00:07:59.649
What did Jesus say when he saw Peter

00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:04.610
Oh there's Mr. Denyme three times

00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:07.569
I told you that you were going to deny me

00:08:08.529 --> 00:08:10.610
Well I seriously doubt that that happened

00:08:11.089 --> 00:08:13.250
Jesus no doubt took Peter

00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:15.970
For a refreshing walk in the dew

00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:19.490
He must have patiently listened

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:23.730
As Peter poured out his heart in sorrow and tears

00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:25.490
More than anything else

00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:28.529
Peter just wanted to be forgiven by his master

00:08:28.529 --> 00:08:30.370
And no doubt

00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:34.049
Jesus extended that forgiveness to Peter

00:08:34.049 --> 00:08:36.370
And he shared with him some refreshing words

00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:37.730
We don't even know what they are

00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:40.210
But they are probably words that

00:08:40.929 --> 00:08:43.570
Peter will remember for the rest of his spiritual life

00:08:44.529 --> 00:08:48.289
That was probably the first good night's sleep Peter had in days

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:50.929
Well what's the lesson

00:08:50.929 --> 00:08:53.250
Well today we live in critical times

00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:56.049
Hard to deal with many of our brothers and sisters

00:08:56.049 --> 00:08:57.970
In the field and right here in Bethel

00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:03.169
Feel weighed down by anxieties of the system of things

00:09:03.169 --> 00:09:07.970
Others of us are burdened with distressing personal circumstances

00:09:08.769 --> 00:09:11.090
Will let God's word

00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:14.289
Let the examples of faithful men like Jesus

00:09:14.289 --> 00:09:16.690
The apostles the prophets

00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:18.850
And others let them refresh you

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:21.889
Let them take you for a walk in the dew

00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:26.450
Jehovah is reassuring us now more than ever before

00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:27.970
That he cares about us

00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:31.009
And he is going to personally take our hand

00:09:31.009 --> 00:09:32.769
Through these difficult times

00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:36.929
Also sometimes brothers will unburden themselves to us

00:09:37.649 --> 00:09:41.250
Well like Christ lighten their load be an empathetic listener

00:09:41.889 --> 00:09:45.809
Now we can't solve every problem but we can listen to every problem

00:09:45.809 --> 00:09:47.570
Listening shows that we care

00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:52.210
In preparing this material there's an outstanding article

00:09:52.210 --> 00:09:54.450
April 2020 watch tower

00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:58.529
The title is listen learn and show compassion

00:09:58.529 --> 00:10:00.210
If you have an opportunity

00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:03.090
Take time to review that beautiful suggestions

00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:05.970
On how we can be refreshing to others
