00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:08.980
When Jehovah God asked Eve, what is this that you have done?

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:14.980
She replied, as recorded a Genesis 313, the serpent deceived me.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:20.980
So I ate. Yes, as far as Eve knew,

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.980
she was misled or thoroughly deceived as the Scriptures state

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:31.980
by a literal serpent that she could see and that spoke to her.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.979
However, we know that lurking behind the scene there in the Garden of Eden

00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:40.979
was really the original serpent, Satan the Devil,

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:44.979
just as Revelation 129 tells us.

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:49.979
But you know, many people scoff about the idea of the Devil.

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:53.979
This calls to mind what Dennis Rougemont, he's a Swiss writer,

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:56.979
what he had to say about the Devil.

00:00:56.979 --> 00:01:01.979
He wrote, Satan's first trick is his incognito.

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:05.980
God says, I am He who is.

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:10.980
But the Devil says, my name is nobody.

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:14.980
There is nobody whom should you be afraid of?

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:18.980
Are you going to tremble before the non-existent?

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:23.980
The writer continues by saying that the Devil has them,

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:26.980
that is, people who don't believe that he exists,

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:30.980
he has them exactly where he wants them.

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:37.980
He vanishes in his success and his triumph is his incognito.

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.980
So it's really just as the poet declared many years ago,

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:47.980
the Devil's finest trick is to persuade you that he does not exist.

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.980
Of course, we know he exists,

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.980
and that he's behind all of the misery, the hate,

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.980
and the violence that has taken place on the earth

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:02.980
from the time of the death of Abel down to the present time.

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:06.980
It's interesting to note, Satan started in the Garden of Eden

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:10.979
by misleading one woman.

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.979
Now, Revelation 129 says, he's misleading.

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:20.979
The entire inhabited earth, what a tremendous contrast that is.

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:23.979
So how does he do it?

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:27.979
How does he mislead people today?

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:30.979
Basically, it's the same way that he misled Eve.

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:34.979
Turn to 2 Corinthians chapter 11 and verse 3.

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:37.979
Notice what Paul wrote.

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:39.979
He explains it nicely.

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:42.979
He says, to the Corinthians, but I am afraid

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:47.979
that somehow as the serpent seduced Eve by its cunning,

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:52.979
and now here's the main point, your minds might be corrupted

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:57.979
away for the sincerity and the chastity that are due to Christ.

00:02:57.979 --> 00:03:03.979
Yes, it's the mind that becomes infected with wrong thinking.

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:07.979
The wrong thinking comes from Satan the Devil.

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:12.979
The serpent got Eve to fix her attention or her mind

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:15.979
on what was contrary to God's will.

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:19.979
What was unlawful then became desirable,

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:22.979
and once her mind was corrupted,

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:27.979
she was easily drawn into an actual act of sin.

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:30.979
Satan operates the same way today.

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:33.979
He may not speak through a serpent,

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:38.979
but he does have visible agents on the earth.

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:40.979
In Jesus' day, we know the religious leaders

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:42.979
were Satan's visible agents.

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:44.979
He called them children of the devil,

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:47.979
and that they wanted to do the will of their father.

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:53.979
So today, individuals and organizations make themselves

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:58.979
Satan's agents by promoting his lies.

00:03:58.979 --> 00:04:00.979
That's what takes place.

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:10.639
First Timothy, chapter 4, verses 1 and 2,

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:15.639
and this makes the point clear how humans become Satan's agents.

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:19.639
Paul wrote, however, the inspired word clearly says

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:23.639
that in later times, we could say we live in later times,

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:26.639
some will fall away from the faith,

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:31.639
paying attention to misleading inspired statements

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:34.639
and teachings of demons.

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:37.639
Now who's doing this teaching of demons?

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:44.639
Verse 2, by means of the hypocrisy of men who speak lies,

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:48.639
whose conscience is seared as with the branding iron.

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:52.639
Yes, so people who promote Satan's viewpoints,

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:57.639
who promote lawlessness, sexual immorality, and spiritism,

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:00.639
they're the channel that Satan has used in addition

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:03.639
to the channels that are available to him

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:05.639
in the form of worldly organizations.

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:10.639
For example, this system's politics, religion, commerce,

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:13.639
and entertainment, and it must be said,

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:19.639
entertainment is playing an outsized role in being the voice

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:23.639
for Satan, the devil, and promoting sexual immorality

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:25.639
and spiritism.

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:30.639
So we have to work to protect ourselves against such things.

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:36.639
The watchtower of April 2019, page 23, paragraph 12,

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:39.639
encourages us to ask ourselves these questions.

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:42.639
It's all in connection with this point about spiritism,

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:45.639
occult practices.

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:50.639
Do I read books, magazines, or articles on the internet

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:52.639
about the occult?

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:56.639
What about the music I listen to?

00:05:56.639 --> 00:06:02.639
The movies and TV shows I watch, or the video games I play,

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:07.639
does any of my entertainment involve spiritism?

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:09.639
That's the key question.

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:13.639
Does it feature such things as vampires, zombies,

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:15.639
or the paranormal?

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:21.639
Does it portray magic, spells, or curses, as harmless fun?

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:25.639
But it balances itself out beautifully here,

00:06:25.639 --> 00:06:28.639
because then it goes on to say that not all entertainment

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:31.639
that features fantasies or fairy tales

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:34.639
is necessarily connected to spiritism.

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:37.639
So this is where we have to use our good judgment,

00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:39.639
and really we're responsible for what we watch,

00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:42.639
for what we read, for what we listen to.

00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:44.639
The ultimate responsibility is our,

00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:46.639
so we want to use good judgment,

00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:48.639
and we want to make good choices

00:06:48.639 --> 00:06:51.639
that will keep us as far away as possible

00:06:51.639 --> 00:06:55.639
from anything to do with the occult.

00:06:55.639 --> 00:07:00.639
The Principle is said forth in Deuteronomy,

00:07:00.639 --> 00:07:03.639
Deuteronomy chapter 13.

00:07:03.639 --> 00:07:06.639
And this is what Jehovah said to the Israelites,

00:07:06.639 --> 00:07:09.639
that we could really apply the principles to our day also,

00:07:09.639 --> 00:07:12.639
and to practices that actually occur.

00:07:12.639 --> 00:07:16.639
Deuteronomy 13 will read verses 1 through 3.

00:07:17.639 --> 00:07:22.639
In case a prophet, or one who foretells by dreams,

00:07:22.639 --> 00:07:28.639
arises in your midst, and gives you a sign or a portant,

00:07:28.639 --> 00:07:33.639
and the sign or the portant about which he spoke to you comes true,

00:07:33.639 --> 00:07:36.639
while he is saying, now notice this connection,

00:07:36.639 --> 00:07:41.639
what he prophesied came true, but what's he telling the people?

00:07:41.639 --> 00:07:44.639
He's saying, let us walk after other gods,

00:07:44.639 --> 00:07:49.639
gods that you have not known, and let us serve them.

00:07:49.639 --> 00:07:52.639
Will Jehovah's words to his people?

00:07:52.639 --> 00:07:55.639
You must not listen to the words of that prophet,

00:07:55.639 --> 00:07:59.639
or that dreamer, for Jehovah your God is testing you,

00:07:59.639 --> 00:08:02.639
to know whether you love Jehovah your God

00:08:02.639 --> 00:08:06.639
with all your heart and all your soul.

00:08:06.639 --> 00:08:10.639
So that is the direction we get from Jehovah,

00:08:10.639 --> 00:08:13.639
but did you notice in the scriptural account?

00:08:14.639 --> 00:08:19.639
What the dreamer, what he prophesied apparently,

00:08:19.639 --> 00:08:24.639
could come true, but we have to remember predictions

00:08:24.639 --> 00:08:27.639
that are based on methods of divination

00:08:27.639 --> 00:08:31.639
and that are designed to take us away from Jehovah,

00:08:31.639 --> 00:08:35.639
they come from one source, the demons.

00:08:35.639 --> 00:08:38.639
They're deceiving, or they're trying to deceive us,

00:08:38.639 --> 00:08:41.639
and turn us away really from serving Jehovah God

00:08:41.639 --> 00:08:43.639
and come enthralled with this idea.

00:08:43.639 --> 00:08:46.639
Oh, it all came true, what was foretold?

00:08:46.639 --> 00:08:49.639
No, that is not the key point, the key point is,

00:08:49.639 --> 00:08:52.639
who is saying these things?

00:08:52.639 --> 00:08:55.639
We listen to Jehovah God.

00:08:55.639 --> 00:08:59.639
On the other hand, also, we do whatever we can

00:08:59.639 --> 00:09:03.639
to awaken people about the truth, about Jehovah God.

00:09:03.639 --> 00:09:06.639
We want to help people to free themselves from spiritism,

00:09:06.639 --> 00:09:11.639
from demonism, want them to know what the purpose is

00:09:11.639 --> 00:09:14.639
that Jehovah God has for us on this earth.

00:09:14.639 --> 00:09:16.639
And it's so simple really in the end

00:09:16.639 --> 00:09:18.639
as to what the source of spiritism is.

00:09:18.639 --> 00:09:20.639
After all, the dead are really dead.

00:09:20.639 --> 00:09:21.639
We know that.

00:09:21.639 --> 00:09:25.639
The occult is nothing more than dealing with the demons,

00:09:25.639 --> 00:09:28.639
whatever form it may take.

00:09:28.639 --> 00:09:33.639
Revelation chapter 22, verse 15 tells us this.

00:09:34.639 --> 00:09:37.639
Outside, it says, this is outside of New Jerusalem,

00:09:37.639 --> 00:09:41.639
out of God's favor, outside are the dogs,

00:09:41.639 --> 00:09:44.639
that is, those who practice disgusting things,

00:09:44.639 --> 00:09:47.639
and those who practice spiritism,

00:09:47.639 --> 00:09:50.639
and those who are sexually immoral,

00:09:50.639 --> 00:09:53.639
and the murderers, and the idolaters,

00:09:53.639 --> 00:09:57.639
and everyone who loves and practices lying.

00:09:57.639 --> 00:10:00.639
A lot of people fall into that category.

00:10:01.639 --> 00:10:05.639
So how wonderful it is that the Bible helps us to draw

00:10:05.639 --> 00:10:10.639
close to Jehovah while putting us on guard against spiritism

00:10:10.639 --> 00:10:14.639
and all other forms of demon propaganda.
