00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:07.879
Our text today says that a true friend loves at all times.

00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:12.880
So what is a true friend?

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:19.879
Jesus helps us to understand this at John 15, this is 12 to 14.

00:00:19.879 --> 00:00:25.769
Let us read that, John 15, 12 to 14.

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.769
Here he says, this is my commandment that you love one another.

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.770
Just as I have loved you, no one has loved greater than this

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.770
that someone should surrender his life in behalf of his friends.

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.770
You are my friends if you do what I am commanding you.

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.770
You see those two elements there, one is to give our life.

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.770
On behalf of our friends and the other one is to love as Jesus loves us.

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.769
Now giving our life for our friend, that is big.

00:01:06.769 --> 00:01:08.769
It's a big challenge.

00:01:08.769 --> 00:01:14.769
But before we can develop that kind of love, we need to learn something else.

00:01:14.769 --> 00:01:21.769
Let us turn you to 1st Peter chapter 1, where this is explained by Peter very well.

00:01:21.769 --> 00:01:25.769
1st Peter chapter 1 and verse 22.

00:01:25.769 --> 00:01:35.109
He says this, now that you have purified yourselves by your obedience to the truth

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:40.109
with unhypocritical, brotherly affection as the result.

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:45.109
Love one another intensely from the heart.

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:48.109
You see what that other element is?

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:52.109
Unhypocritical, brotherly affection.

00:01:53.109 --> 00:02:02.549
And this intense love is not a cold, reasoned love for our brothers in general.

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.549
Something that we have for all our brothers.

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:13.550
But we reserve warm, personal affection, brotherly affection only for those who are close to us.

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:19.550
You see it will be kind of hypocritical to say, I will give my life for my brother.

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.830
But I cannot be nice to him.

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.830
Intense love requires effort.

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:34.830
We need to expand our heart, widen it out, to include not only those whom we like,

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.830
but also those whom we maybe don't like so much.

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:44.830
Now does this mean that we have to be close friends with everyone?

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:52.830
What Jehovah in Jesus knows knows that it is impossible for us to be close associates with everyone

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.830
and to spend all our time entertaining people.

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:59.830
That is not what brotherly affection means.

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:06.830
Brotherly affection means that we change on the inside.

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:12.830
We expand our heart to embrace all the friends of Jesus.

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:14.830
No, don't lose heart.

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:16.830
Jesus said the standard.

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:23.830
He knows that we can succeed and that we will succeed.

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:34.830
What we would like to do now is discuss how we can develop intense love by means of forgiveness and by means of prayer.

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:36.830
So let's take forgiveness first.

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:40.830
First Peter 4 verse 8 says this.

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.830
First Peter 4 and verse 8.

00:03:43.830 --> 00:04:00.870
He says, above all things, have intense love for one another because love covers a multitude of sins.

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:09.870
Now we are imperfect and the reality is that we are going to fail our friends at some time and they will fail us.

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.870
And what could be the result?

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:12.870
What hurt feelings?

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:18.870
But let's also read here, Proverbs 18 verse 19.

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.870
Here in Proverbs 18 verse 19 it says,

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:34.699
The brother offended is more unyielding than a fortified city and they are disputes like the bars of a fortress.

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:43.699
Well, when our feelings are hurt, we tend to put up defenses like a bars of a fortress.

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:47.699
So how can we remove that bar of fortress?

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:51.699
Well, for one thing, an apology will go a long way.

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:57.699
But we may say, well, I'm hurt, my brother offended me.

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:00.699
Why do I have to apologize?

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:03.980
I don't do anything wrong.

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:08.980
Well, if we want the friendship to continue, we have no choice.

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:13.980
And the longer we put it off, the worse it gets.

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:16.980
Let's take the example of Jesus.

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:19.980
Peter denied Jesus three times.

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:23.980
He even swore that he was no friend of Jesus.

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:28.449
Now Jesus was right there hearing all of this.

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:32.449
But afterwards Jesus removed those barriers.

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:36.449
He opened the way for them to be reconciled.

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:40.449
After his resurrection, he spoke to the woman and he told them,

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:45.449
go and tell the disciples and Peter.

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:47.449
So he singled Peter out.

00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:55.449
He gave him a special invitation and Jesus met with Peter.

00:05:55.449 --> 00:06:05.449
Can you imagine how Peter feels to this day about that friendship that Jesus reestablished with him?

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:09.449
And not only did he reestablish that friendship,

00:06:09.449 --> 00:06:14.449
he used him in very many powerful ways.

00:06:14.449 --> 00:06:16.449
So what do we learn from this?

00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:20.449
It is not realistic to expect too much from our friends.

00:06:20.449 --> 00:06:22.449
We're all imperfect.

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:25.449
Don't give up on your friend.

00:06:25.449 --> 00:06:26.449
Forgive.

00:06:26.449 --> 00:06:30.449
Open the door of your heart wide.

00:06:30.449 --> 00:06:37.449
Forgiveness is essential if imperfect people are going to have lasting friendships.

00:06:37.449 --> 00:06:41.449
Now the second one is that of prayer.

00:06:41.449 --> 00:06:46.790
In 1 Peter 4, verse 7, it says,

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:50.790
the second part, be vigilant with a view to prayers.

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:59.790
So practically, how do prayers help us to acquire brotherly affection?

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:03.790
Well, we have brothers coming from all over the world.

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:07.790
And their culture might be quite different from ours.

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:12.790
And we may find it difficult to understand the thinking of some.

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:18.790
Their behavior may be strange, unusual, not quite what we expected to happen.

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:24.790
We may even feel, well, he's not really my kind of person.

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:28.790
Well, take the matter in prayer to Jehovah.

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:31.790
Just mention the brother's name.

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:34.790
Explain the problem as we see it.

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:37.790
And then ask for Jehovah to help you.

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:40.790
What will Jehovah do?

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:45.790
Jehovah will help us to change how we feel about our brother.

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:52.790
And Jehovah can give us the desire and the power to change our attitude.

00:07:52.790 --> 00:08:01.790
And pray again until we begin to see our brother as Jehovah sees our brother.

00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:07.790
If Jehovah loves my brother, who am I to withhold my friendship?

00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:11.790
Jehovah's judgment surely are better than mine.

00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:15.790
So then in summary, two important ways to be a friend.

00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:19.790
Forgive as Jehovah has forgiven us.

00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:25.790
And secondly, pray that Jehovah will open our hearts wide.

00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:29.790
So why do we need real friends now?

00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:37.139
Well, our text for today says it's a brother who is born for times of distress.

00:08:37.139 --> 00:08:43.139
Time of the greatest distress the world has ever seen is upon us.

00:08:43.139 --> 00:08:46.139
Will we be true friends then?

00:08:46.139 --> 00:08:50.139
Only if we are true friends now.

00:08:50.139 --> 00:08:56.139
Have intense love for all of Jesus' friends.

00:08:56.139 --> 00:09:00.139
And they will trust you when it matters.

00:09:00.139 --> 00:09:08.139
And this friendship, we will be friends, not only through Armageddon, but to all eternity.
