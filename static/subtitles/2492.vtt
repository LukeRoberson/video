00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:07.650
So, you are excited to go out in service.

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:09.449
Do you think you are ready?

00:00:10.449 --> 00:00:12.050
Not so fast.

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:15.650
Before you go in the ministry, there's a few things we need to go over.

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.649
First, we must learn the three P's.

00:00:18.649 --> 00:00:20.649
The three P's?

00:00:20.649 --> 00:00:21.649
Yes.

00:00:21.649 --> 00:00:26.649
Preparation, personal appearance, and proper behavior.

00:00:26.649 --> 00:00:29.649
First, preparation.

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:33.649
Preparation is the first pillar of success in the ministry.

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.450
Every job requires the proper tools.

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.850
When it comes to tools for preaching, the variety might seem intimidating,

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.450
but never fear.

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.850
We have the teaching toolbox.

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.450
Finding the right tools is easier than ever.

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.450
Once you have your tools, make sure and practice your presentation

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:55.250
before you leave the house.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.560
We don't want to be preparing on the doorstep.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.560
Now that you are well prepared,

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.359
it's time to talk about...

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:06.959
Personal appearance.

00:01:06.959 --> 00:01:11.359
How we look is very important because we represent Jehovah.

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:17.560
Getting ready for the ministry, we need to make sure our appearance is saying the right things.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.560
Jehovah wants your appearance to be well arranged and modest.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:27.930
What that means is that we look and smell clean.

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.730
Our clothes fit well, but not too well.

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:35.129
Our hair is done.

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:38.530
And we are enjoying too much attention to ourselves.

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.530
Looking sharp, my son.

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.129
Now it's time to talk about...

00:01:43.129 --> 00:01:45.129
Proper behavior.

00:01:45.129 --> 00:01:49.730
Our conduct while in the ministry is another way we can bring praise to Jehovah.

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.730
So make sure you are on your best behavior.

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.329
Avoid talking or laughing loudly.

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:57.129
Playing around.

00:01:57.129 --> 00:02:00.730
Or intruding on anyone's property or privacy.

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:04.530
Also, no eating at the door.

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.129
Remember, when we go door to door, people see us.

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.729
And good behavior gives a good witness.

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:16.930
We would never want to give anyone a reason to find fault with our ministry.

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.129
Can I go downstairs now?

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:21.930
Yes, looks like you are ready.

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.789
It's time to put the three P's to the test.

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:29.389
Hi, my name's Caleb. What's your name?

00:02:29.389 --> 00:02:32.389
Hi, Caleb. My name is...
