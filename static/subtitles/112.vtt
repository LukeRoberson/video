00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:03.910
Welcome to JW Broadcasting.

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:06.910
Here's a glimpse of what's ahead.

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:10.910
What do you do when a situation seems hopeless?

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.910
We'll meet three young people from Congo Kinshasa

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.910
whose Christian hopes stabilize them when disaster struck.

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:21.910
Does the stress of this world sometimes follow you home

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:23.910
and weigh on your marriage?

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.910
We'll examine a Bible principle that can strengthen your relationship

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:32.909
and preserve your home as a haven of peace.

00:00:32.909 --> 00:00:35.909
If we have doubts from time to time,

00:00:35.909 --> 00:00:37.909
they need not weaken us.

00:00:37.909 --> 00:00:42.909
Our music video this month will inspire us to feed our faith.

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:48.909
This is the March 2024 edition of JW Broadcasting.

00:00:48.909 --> 00:01:11.659
Our theme this month is Feed Your Hope.

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:15.659
Hope is essential for peace, happiness, courage,

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.659
and life.

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:19.659
But what is hope?

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:21.659
When the Bible uses the word hope,

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.659
it's referring not only to the desire for something good,

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:29.659
but also to the basis for believing it will happen.

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:34.659
So hope is more than just wishful thinking or even expectation.

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:36.659
It's based on fact.

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.659
There's evidence to back it up.

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:42.659
Thus true hope can come only from the one who has the power

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.659
to fulfill whatever he promises.

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.659
Jehovah God.

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:50.659
Jehovah provides hope in abundance.

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:56.659
Notice what Romans 1513 says about Jehovah.

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:02.659
May the God who gives hope fill you with all joy and peace

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:06.659
by your trusting in him so that you may abound in hope

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.659
with power of Holy Spirit.

00:02:09.659 --> 00:02:15.659
Yes, Jehovah gives us what we need to abound in hope.

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:20.659
And yet the Apostle Paul also wrote as recorded at Colossians 123

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:24.659
that a Christian could be shifted away from the hope.

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:27.659
So we must never take our hope for granted.

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:29.659
We need to feed it.

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:31.659
What do you need to feed?

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:32.659
Hope.

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:36.659
Two things are mentioned at Romans 154.

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:41.659
For all the things that were written beforehand were written

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:46.659
for our instruction so that through our endurance

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:52.659
and through the comfort from the scriptures we might have hope.

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:56.659
So did you notice what feeds hope?

00:02:56.659 --> 00:03:02.659
Our endurance and the comfort from the scriptures.

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:07.659
What we take into our minds is vital to keeping our hope strong.

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:11.659
For example, recall what happened shortly after Jesus was executed

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:14.659
as recorded in Luke chapter 24.

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:17.659
This is part of the conversation between an unidentified traveler

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:20.659
and the disheartened disciples.

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:24.659
The disciples were beside themselves with grief over Jesus' death.

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:27.659
The traveler, though, was in fact the resurrected Jesus.

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:30.659
The disciples didn't yet realize this.

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:34.659
So they said, as recorded at Luke 2421,

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:38.659
but we were hoping that this man was the one

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:40.659
who was going to deliver Israel.

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:42.659
Yes, and besides all these things,

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:46.659
this is the third day since these things occurred.

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:51.659
The scripture shows just how susceptible we can be to discouragement

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:55.659
when things don't turn out as we expect.

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:58.659
But notice what Jesus did to help them.

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:01.659
Verses 25 through 27.

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:03.659
So he said to them,

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:05.659
oh, senseless ones,

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:09.659
and slow of heart to believe all the things the prophets have spoken.

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:13.659
Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer these things

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:15.659
and to enter into his glory?

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:18.660
And starting with Moses,

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.660
and all the prophets,

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.660
he interpreted to them things pertaining to himself

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.660
in all the scriptures.

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.660
So how did Jesus feed their hope?

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.660
First, by showing them that they were right

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:36.660
to hope in the fulfillment of the scriptures,

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:41.660
and then by teaching them how those scriptures had been fulfilled.

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:44.660
Can we do the same today?

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:45.660
Yes.

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.660
When we're facing challenges that threaten our hope,

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.660
we should ask Jehovah for guidance

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:52.660
by means of his Holy Spirit,

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:54.660
and then with the help of the publications

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.660
of the faithful and discrete slave,

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.660
we should meditate carefully

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.660
on how the scriptures are being fulfilled.

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:05.660
It can be difficult to find time for this in these hectic days.

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.660
There are so many claims on our attention,

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:10.660
so many things to know and do.

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:13.660
But what you take into your mind

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:18.660
is vital to keeping your hope alive.

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:21.660
The humanitarian crises facing mankind today

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:24.660
make any one of us feel anxious.

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.660
Experts in fields of technology, finance,

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.660
and government have found it necessary to coin new words

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:33.660
to convey the gravity of the situation.

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:40.660
In 2023, the word polycrisis began to soar in usage.

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:44.660
A polycrisis refers to many global threats

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:46.660
happening at the same time.

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:49.660
The overlapping of health emergencies,

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:53.660
climate change, wars, forced migrations, natural disasters,

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:58.660
and economic collapse all happening simultaneously.

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:04.660
A polycrisis could throw a person off balance spiritually.

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:07.660
But as students of Jesus sign of the last days,

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:09.660
we have fully anticipated

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:12.660
that there would be many serious problems

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:15.660
facing mankind at the same time

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:18.660
and on an unprecedented scale.

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:21.660
But isn't it interesting that the world itself

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:23.660
has seen fit to come up with an expression

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:26.660
that adequately matches what we are going through?

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:28.660
Whether they realize it or not,

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:33.660
they're acknowledging that Jesus' words are being fulfilled.

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:37.660
So rather than become eaten up by anxiety,

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:41.660
we can find hope in these very same facts

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:47.660
if we meditate on the fulfillment of the scriptures.

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:52.660
The scriptures contain the promise of God,

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:56.660
a promise of salvation.

00:06:56.660 --> 00:07:00.660
Jehovah God will bring to ruin those ruining the earth.

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:04.660
There is going to be a resurrection.

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:06.660
Death will be no more.

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:08.660
The righteous will possess the earth

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:11.660
and they will live forever on it.

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:14.660
Understanding how the scriptures apply

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:18.660
and how they're fulfilled builds our faith.

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:22.660
The stronger our faith is, the stronger our hope will be,

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:26.660
because faith is the assured,

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:32.660
the assured expectation of what is hoped for.

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:35.660
Do you think often about your hope?

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:39.660
Do you meditate on what it means?

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:42.660
First Thessalonians 5.8 says,

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:47.660
let us put on the hope of salvation as a helmet.

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:50.660
As a helmet protects the head,

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:53.660
so hope protects the mind.

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:56.660
Who of us does not need such a helmet?

00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:59.660
Perhaps you have a favorite Kingdom song

00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:01.660
or original song from JW.org

00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:05.660
that keeps Jehovah's promises shining brightly in your mind.

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:08.660
When you recall that song,

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:12.660
your hope which in turn guards your thinking.

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:16.660
Our hope has to be so real to us

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:19.660
that we can see ourselves in the new world no longer

00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:22.660
battling illness and depression,

00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:26.660
but waking up each day with better hearing, better vision,

00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:29.660
better looks, better outlooks,

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:32.659
no longer mourning the death of those we love,

00:08:32.659 --> 00:08:37.659
but rather experiencing the thrill of seeing them come back to life.

00:08:37.659 --> 00:08:41.659
What's the longest life span you've ever heard of?

00:08:41.659 --> 00:08:45.659
What's the greatest number you can think of?

00:08:45.659 --> 00:08:47.659
Now combine the two concepts,

00:08:47.659 --> 00:08:49.659
living for...

00:08:49.659 --> 00:08:51.659
Well, we could attempt to explain

00:08:51.659 --> 00:08:54.659
Googleplexes of galactic millenniums,

00:08:54.659 --> 00:08:55.659
but the fact is,

00:08:55.659 --> 00:08:59.659
no matter how great a period of time you can possibly fathom,

00:08:59.659 --> 00:09:01.659
Jehovah promises us life

00:09:01.659 --> 00:09:04.659
that cannot be defined by any number

00:09:04.659 --> 00:09:06.659
because it never stops.

00:09:06.659 --> 00:09:08.659
That's what the Bible means

00:09:08.659 --> 00:09:12.659
by its many references to everlasting life.

00:09:12.659 --> 00:09:16.659
Visualize a project

00:09:16.659 --> 00:09:20.659
that would take several thousand years to plan and complete.

00:09:20.659 --> 00:09:24.659
What kind of forests would you like to grow?

00:09:24.659 --> 00:09:28.659
Imagine having millions of years to observe,

00:09:28.659 --> 00:09:32.659
analyze and draw new conclusions from Jehovah's activities

00:09:32.659 --> 00:09:34.659
and creative works.

00:09:34.659 --> 00:09:36.659
What possibilities exist

00:09:36.659 --> 00:09:38.659
for an earth filled with loyal,

00:09:38.659 --> 00:09:40.659
loving people who cooperate

00:09:40.659 --> 00:09:44.659
with the many systems Jehovah has created?

00:09:44.659 --> 00:09:48.659
What kind of knowledge would you like to acquire

00:09:48.659 --> 00:09:50.659
that is currently out of reach

00:09:50.659 --> 00:09:52.659
because of our limited lifespan?

00:09:52.659 --> 00:09:54.659
What will it be like

00:09:54.659 --> 00:09:58.659
to build on the knowledge of hundreds of generations?

00:09:58.659 --> 00:10:00.659
Picture whom you will meet

00:10:00.659 --> 00:10:02.659
in the resurrection.

00:10:02.659 --> 00:10:04.659
Yes, we think of family members

00:10:04.659 --> 00:10:06.659
and faithful ones of old,

00:10:06.659 --> 00:10:08.659
but consider what it will be like

00:10:08.659 --> 00:10:12.659
to understand how you are related to every person

00:10:12.659 --> 00:10:16.659
on this planet all the way back to the beginning.

00:10:16.659 --> 00:10:20.659
Imagine all intelligent creation

00:10:20.659 --> 00:10:22.659
in heaven and on earth united

00:10:22.659 --> 00:10:26.659
as one happy family praising Jehovah.

00:10:26.659 --> 00:10:30.230
Is this just wishful thinking?

00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:32.230
Happy thoughts?

00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:34.230
A dream?

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:36.230
No.

00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:38.230
This is hope.

00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:40.230
It's meditation on the promise

00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:42.230
of God who cannot lie,

00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:44.230
meditation on what he has done

00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:46.230
to fulfill his promise,

00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:48.230
providing the ransom,

00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:50.230
and establishing a heavenly kingdom

00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:52.230
that will bring mankind back to perfection.

00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:54.230
Meditation on Jehovah's personality.

00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:58.230
A personality revealed in his creative works

00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:00.230
in the Scriptures

00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:02.230
and mirrored perfectly by his only begotten Son.

00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:04.230
A personality we know,

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:06.230
not only through deep study,

00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:10.230
but also through our own experience.

00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:12.230
And this leads us

00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:14.230
to the second way we feed our hope.

00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:18.230
Recall that Romans 154 said that there are two ways

00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:20.230
to feed your hope

00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:22.230
through the comfort from the Scriptures

00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:26.230
but also through our endurance.

00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:28.230
How does endurance

00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:30.230
feed your hope?

00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:32.230
Well, notice what Paul said about this

00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:34.230
back at Romans chapter 5,

00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:36.230
verses 3 through 5.

00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:39.860
Not only that,

00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:41.860
but let us rejoice

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:43.860
while in tribulations.

00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:45.860
Since we know

00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:47.860
that tribulation

00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:49.860
produces endurance,

00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:51.860
endurance in turn,

00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:53.860
an approved condition,

00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:55.860
the approved condition in turn hope.

00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:57.860
And the hope

00:11:57.860 --> 00:11:59.860
does not lead to disappointment.

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:01.860
Now the hope mentioned here

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:05.860
is referring not to our initial hope.

00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:07.860
We already had that when we learned the promise

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:09.860
of God contained in the Scriptures.

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:11.860
That's why Paul begins verse 3 with the words

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:13.860
not only that.

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:15.860
Yes, not only

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:17.860
do we rejoice in our initial hope

00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:19.860
but we rejoice in our reinforced hope.

00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:21.860
Hope made even stronger

00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:23.860
through new experiences with Jehovah

00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:25.860
as our personal helper.

00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:27.860
Now the only way

00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:29.860
to understand this process fully

00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:31.860
is by going through it.

00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:33.860
What's been your experience?

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:35.860
What have you done

00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:37.860
when undergoing tribulation?

00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:39.860
No doubt you turned to Jehovah

00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:41.860
for help.

00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:43.860
And then what happened?

00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:45.860
He helped you.

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:47.860
True, the trial might not have

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:49.860
disappeared,

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:51.860
but you discovered

00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:53.860
that you somehow had the strength

00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:55.860
to endure it or

00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:57.860
the wisdom to manage it

00:12:57.860 --> 00:12:59.860
or practical aid

00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:01.860
or encouragement at just the right time

00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:03.860
or the courage

00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:05.860
to continue bearing witness to the truth.

00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:07.860
How did you feel

00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:09.860
in that moment?

00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:11.860
Did you sense

00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:13.860
that Jehovah heard

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:15.860
your prayer?

00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:17.860
Did you perceive Jehovah

00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:19.860
reassuring you that you

00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:21.860
have a relationship

00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:23.860
when you go through that

00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:25.860
even once

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:27.860
you no longer wonder

00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:29.860
whether you could endure a crisis.

00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:31.860
You know you can

00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:33.860
with Jehovah's help.

00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:35.860
That is hope.

00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:37.860
Not simply a desire

00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:39.860
for something good

00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:41.860
but the basis for believing

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:43.860
it will happen.

00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:45.860
Many of our dear brothers and sisters

00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:47.860
have built up a lifetime

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:49.860
experience.

00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:51.860
That is why their hope

00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:53.860
hasn't weakened

00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:55.860
despite waiting for the new world for decades.

00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:57.860
To the contrary,

00:13:57.860 --> 00:13:59.860
their hope has been strengthened

00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:01.860
through experience.

00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:03.860
They know first hand

00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:05.860
what Romans 5-3-5 is talking about.

00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:07.860
And likely you do as well.

00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:09.860
Thank God for hope.

00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:11.860
Jehovah is the God who gives hope.

00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:13.860
May we never become

00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:15.860
shifted away from our hope.

00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:17.860
When difficulties arise

00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:19.860
feed your hope.

00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:21.860
Continue to meditate on the comfort

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:23.860
from the Scriptures.

00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:25.860
Keep trusting in Jehovah for strength

00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:27.860
and wisdom.

00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:29.860
And each day take note

00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:31.860
of how He reassures you

00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:33.860
that hope.

00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:37.860
Your hope is real.

00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:39.860
You can read

00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:41.860
and listen to so many accounts

00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:43.860
right here on JW.org

00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:45.860
and the Scriptures

00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:47.860
and sisters who are going through

00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:49.860
this exact process.

00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:51.860
Let's hear from three young people

00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:55.620
in Congo, Kinshasa right now.

00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:57.620
We began to hear a lot

00:14:57.620 --> 00:15:01.190
of noise outside.

00:15:01.190 --> 00:15:03.190
When I came out,

00:15:03.190 --> 00:15:05.190
I saw volcano fire.

00:15:05.190 --> 00:15:07.190
I saw many people running.

00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:09.190
I was the only grown-up

00:15:09.190 --> 00:15:11.190
at home at the time.

00:15:11.190 --> 00:15:13.190
I was very afraid

00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:15.190
because it was my first time seeing

00:15:15.190 --> 00:15:16.190
such a disaster.

00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:18.190
But it became worse

00:15:18.190 --> 00:15:20.190
in July 2017.

00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:27.919
So we left

00:15:27.919 --> 00:15:29.919
and our goods were destroyed.

00:15:29.919 --> 00:15:36.529
When we heard that

00:15:36.529 --> 00:15:38.529
there would be war at our village,

00:15:38.529 --> 00:15:40.529
people were very afraid.

00:15:40.529 --> 00:15:44.639
We didn't take many things

00:15:44.639 --> 00:15:46.639
and we went to Uganda.

00:15:46.639 --> 00:15:52.539
In the morning,

00:15:52.539 --> 00:15:54.539
we were informed that our house was

00:15:54.539 --> 00:15:56.539
among the houses destroyed by the volcano.

00:15:56.539 --> 00:16:00.539
This news affected us very much

00:16:00.539 --> 00:16:02.539
because when we left,

00:16:02.539 --> 00:16:04.539
we took nothing.

00:16:04.539 --> 00:16:06.539
So we lost everything.

00:16:06.539 --> 00:16:08.539
When we were running away,

00:16:08.539 --> 00:16:10.539
my father said that we must go

00:16:10.539 --> 00:16:13.820
to the beach to look for a boat.

00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:17.940
He was on a motorbike.

00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:19.940
He had an accident

00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:21.940
and he was wounded.

00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:23.940
That wound made him suffer

00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:25.940
for a time.

00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:32.100
And that led to his death.

00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:34.100
We fled from Bukwa

00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:36.100
to Bunya.

00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:41.299
We were very afraid

00:16:41.299 --> 00:16:43.299
because in Bunya,

00:16:43.299 --> 00:16:45.299
we didn't have a field

00:16:45.299 --> 00:16:47.299
and we didn't have a house.

00:16:47.299 --> 00:16:49.299
So we wondered

00:16:49.299 --> 00:16:53.789
how will we live in Bunya?

00:16:53.789 --> 00:16:55.789
The way present sisters helped me

00:16:55.789 --> 00:16:57.789
strengthened my faith.

00:16:57.789 --> 00:17:01.549
That strong faith made me joyful.

00:17:01.549 --> 00:17:03.549
When we came back to Congo,

00:17:03.549 --> 00:17:05.549
I continued studying

00:17:05.549 --> 00:17:14.210
until I got baptized.

00:17:14.210 --> 00:17:16.210
Jehovah's organization

00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:18.210
did much, very much for us.

00:17:18.210 --> 00:17:20.210
First, they took care of us spiritually

00:17:20.210 --> 00:17:22.210
and physically.

00:17:22.210 --> 00:17:24.210
And second,

00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:26.210
they gave us a place to live,

00:17:26.210 --> 00:17:28.210
a home.

00:17:28.210 --> 00:17:30.210
Because of that,

00:17:30.210 --> 00:17:36.940
I am so thankful to Jehovah.

00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:38.940
What helped at that period of time

00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:40.940
was the thought we find

00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:42.940
at Psalm 46, 1 and 2.

00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:44.940
That scripture shows

00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:46.940
that God is our refuge.

00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:50.579
So we have nothing to fear,

00:17:50.579 --> 00:17:52.579
even though the world changes.

00:17:52.579 --> 00:17:54.579
And even though the mountain

00:17:54.579 --> 00:17:56.579
topples to the depths of the sea,

00:17:56.579 --> 00:17:58.579
we cannot fear.

00:17:58.579 --> 00:18:00.579
And I saw the fulfillment

00:18:00.579 --> 00:18:02.579
of that scripture in my life.

00:18:02.579 --> 00:18:12.319
Even though I had

00:18:12.319 --> 00:18:14.319
difficult circumstances in my life,

00:18:14.319 --> 00:18:16.319
I cannot give up.

00:18:16.319 --> 00:18:19.599
I will serve Jehovah

00:18:19.599 --> 00:18:21.599
for all my life.

00:18:21.599 --> 00:18:25.039
Now I'm feeling very well.

00:18:25.039 --> 00:18:28.700
I am very happy

00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:30.700
to be in Jehovah's organization.

00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:32.700
I'm determined to serve Jehovah

00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:34.700
for all my days

00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:36.700
and to keep my integrity.

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:38.700
I decided to show Jehovah

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:40.700
the same love and happiness

00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:42.700
shown to me.

00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:44.700
Now I'm a regular pioneer.

00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:46.700
Now I'm an auxiliary pioneer.

00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:52.059
Now I'm a regular pioneer

00:18:52.059 --> 00:18:54.059
and a ministerial servant

00:18:54.059 --> 00:18:56.059
in our congregation.

00:18:56.059 --> 00:18:58.059
I also work as a remote volunteer

00:18:58.059 --> 00:19:09.569
for Bethel.

00:19:09.569 --> 00:19:11.569
Esperance and Moes

00:19:11.569 --> 00:19:13.569
trusted in Jehovah during a time

00:19:13.569 --> 00:19:15.569
of great distress.

00:19:15.569 --> 00:19:17.569
And their hope grew stronger

00:19:17.569 --> 00:19:21.140
as a result.

00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:23.140
Every time we see Jehovah

00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:25.140
fulfill a promise,

00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:27.140
its strengthens our hope.

00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:29.140
In this episode of Our History

00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:31.140
and Motion, see how

00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:33.140
Theocratic building projects show

00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:37.630
evidence of Jehovah's blessing.

00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:39.630
To advance true worship

00:19:39.630 --> 00:19:41.630
and spread the good news,

00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:45.200
build.

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:47.200
Theocratic building projects

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:49.200
strengthen our faith

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:51.200
and feed our hope.

00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:53.200
How?

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:55.200
Let's see in this episode of

00:19:55.200 --> 00:20:06.029
Our History and Motion.

00:20:06.029 --> 00:20:08.029
In ancient times,

00:20:08.029 --> 00:20:10.029
Nehemiah was moved to exclaim

00:20:10.029 --> 00:20:12.029
the good hand of my God was upon me.

00:20:12.029 --> 00:20:14.029
Yes,

00:20:14.029 --> 00:20:16.029
against daunting odds,

00:20:16.029 --> 00:20:18.029
Jehovah provided what was needed

00:20:18.029 --> 00:20:20.029
at the right time

00:20:20.029 --> 00:20:22.029
the same has proved true

00:20:22.029 --> 00:20:24.029
in modern times.

00:20:24.029 --> 00:20:26.029
As the significant year

00:20:26.029 --> 00:20:28.029
1914 approached,

00:20:28.029 --> 00:20:30.029
the Bible students,

00:20:30.029 --> 00:20:32.029
as we were then called,

00:20:32.029 --> 00:20:34.029
prepared for an all-out preaching

00:20:34.029 --> 00:20:36.029
campaign to publicize

00:20:36.029 --> 00:20:38.029
the long hope for fulfillment

00:20:38.029 --> 00:20:40.029
of Bible prophecy.

00:20:40.029 --> 00:20:42.029
So in 1909,

00:20:42.029 --> 00:20:44.029
CT Russell moved world headquarters

00:20:44.029 --> 00:20:46.029
from Pennsylvania

00:20:46.029 --> 00:20:48.029
to Brooklyn, New York.

00:20:48.029 --> 00:20:50.029
The United Buildings,

00:20:50.029 --> 00:20:52.029
renamed Bethel,

00:20:52.029 --> 00:20:54.029
and the Brooklyn Tabernacle

00:20:54.029 --> 00:20:56.029
accommodated the increased workload.

00:20:56.029 --> 00:20:58.029
At the time, though,

00:20:58.029 --> 00:21:00.029
some thought the preaching work

00:21:00.029 --> 00:21:02.029
would end with the birth

00:21:02.029 --> 00:21:04.029
of the kingdom in 1914.

00:21:04.029 --> 00:21:06.029
Little did they realize

00:21:06.029 --> 00:21:08.029
how much work remained to be done.

00:21:08.029 --> 00:21:10.029
Opposition to the

00:21:10.029 --> 00:21:12.029
kingdom works sparked

00:21:12.029 --> 00:21:14.029
by World War I,

00:21:14.029 --> 00:21:16.029
peaked with the imprisonment

00:21:16.029 --> 00:21:18.029
of the wartime shortages of supplies.

00:21:18.029 --> 00:21:20.029
It appeared impossible

00:21:20.029 --> 00:21:22.029
to continue operations in Brooklyn.

00:21:22.029 --> 00:21:24.029
The Brooklyn Tabernacle was sold.

00:21:24.029 --> 00:21:26.029
But efforts to sell

00:21:26.029 --> 00:21:28.029
124 Columbia Heights

00:21:28.029 --> 00:21:30.029
failed.

00:21:30.029 --> 00:21:32.029
Jehovah had plans for it.

00:21:32.029 --> 00:21:34.029
The 1920s

00:21:34.029 --> 00:21:36.029
saw a renewed zeal

00:21:36.029 --> 00:21:38.029
for the ministry,

00:21:38.029 --> 00:21:40.029
and consequently a massive increase

00:21:40.029 --> 00:21:42.029
in the publication

00:21:42.029 --> 00:21:44.029
and distribution of books

00:21:44.029 --> 00:21:46.029
in New York.

00:21:46.029 --> 00:21:48.029
The decision was made

00:21:48.029 --> 00:21:50.029
to print it ourselves.

00:21:50.029 --> 00:21:52.029
This required an expanded presence

00:21:52.029 --> 00:21:54.029
in Brooklyn.

00:21:54.029 --> 00:21:56.029
After outgrowing a small

00:21:56.029 --> 00:21:58.029
printer-intermented building,

00:21:58.029 --> 00:22:00.029
then outgrowing another,

00:22:00.029 --> 00:22:02.029
construction commenced

00:22:02.029 --> 00:22:04.029
on a new eight-story factory

00:22:04.029 --> 00:22:06.029
just a few blocks away

00:22:06.029 --> 00:22:10.849
from the expanded Brooklyn Bethel.

00:22:10.849 --> 00:22:12.849
Just over a decade later,

00:22:12.849 --> 00:22:14.849
during World War II,

00:22:14.849 --> 00:22:16.849
there was no time

00:22:16.849 --> 00:22:18.849
as concentration camps

00:22:18.849 --> 00:22:20.849
and persecution of our brothers

00:22:20.849 --> 00:22:22.849
increased around the world.

00:22:22.849 --> 00:22:24.849
Despite that,

00:22:24.849 --> 00:22:26.849
the number of kingdom publishers

00:22:26.849 --> 00:22:28.849
doubled during the war.

00:22:28.849 --> 00:22:30.849
Jehovah knew this was

00:22:30.849 --> 00:22:32.849
no time to slow down.

00:22:32.849 --> 00:22:34.849
In 1940,

00:22:34.849 --> 00:22:36.849
construction began

00:22:36.849 --> 00:22:38.849
on a three-story building

00:22:38.849 --> 00:22:40.849
at Kingdom Farm

00:22:40.849 --> 00:22:42.849
in South Lansing, New York.

00:22:42.849 --> 00:22:43.849
But what would it be used for?

00:22:43.849 --> 00:22:45.849
In 1943,

00:22:45.849 --> 00:22:47.849
the war had made building

00:22:47.849 --> 00:22:49.849
materials extremely scarce.

00:22:49.849 --> 00:22:51.849
But the brothers had already

00:22:51.849 --> 00:22:53.849
finished construction.

00:22:53.849 --> 00:22:55.849
Jehovah wanted it used

00:22:55.849 --> 00:22:57.849
as a school to train missionaries.

00:22:57.849 --> 00:22:59.849
The Watchtower Bible School

00:22:59.849 --> 00:23:01.849
of Gillian.

00:23:01.849 --> 00:23:03.849
This marked the beginning

00:23:03.849 --> 00:23:05.849
of a period of astounding growth.

00:23:05.849 --> 00:23:07.849
To keep pace

00:23:07.849 --> 00:23:09.849
with the ever-increasing demand

00:23:09.849 --> 00:23:11.849
for Bible literature,

00:23:11.849 --> 00:23:13.849
it was a factory building.

00:23:13.849 --> 00:23:15.849
Eventually, the printer

00:23:15.849 --> 00:23:17.849
complex covered five city blocks.

00:23:17.849 --> 00:23:19.849
In a 22-year period,

00:23:19.849 --> 00:23:21.849
the number of kingdom publishers

00:23:21.849 --> 00:23:23.849
worldwide tripled.

00:23:23.849 --> 00:23:25.849
In 1971,

00:23:25.849 --> 00:23:27.849
a printer was constructed

00:23:27.849 --> 00:23:29.849
at Watchtower Farms in upstate New York

00:23:29.849 --> 00:23:31.849
and has expanded

00:23:31.849 --> 00:23:33.849
several times over the years

00:23:33.849 --> 00:23:35.849
to increase its printing capacity.

00:23:35.849 --> 00:23:37.849
By the mid-1980s,

00:23:37.849 --> 00:23:39.849
from Argentina to Zimbabwe,

00:23:39.849 --> 00:23:41.849
we expanded our facilities

00:23:41.849 --> 00:23:43.849
at more than 40 branches

00:23:43.849 --> 00:23:45.849
around the world.

00:23:45.849 --> 00:23:47.849
As stated in the January

00:23:47.849 --> 00:23:49.849
1st 1986 Watchtower,

00:23:49.849 --> 00:23:51.849
there appears to be no

00:23:51.849 --> 00:23:53.849
end to the modern day expansion.

00:23:53.849 --> 00:23:55.849
Jehovah's organization

00:23:55.849 --> 00:23:57.849
is building

00:23:57.849 --> 00:23:59.849
for an eternal future.

00:23:59.849 --> 00:24:01.849
Currently,

00:24:01.849 --> 00:24:03.849
in Africa,

00:24:03.849 --> 00:24:05.849
13 branch facilities

00:24:05.849 --> 00:24:07.849
need to be enlarged or renovated.

00:24:07.849 --> 00:24:09.849
Over 50 approved

00:24:09.849 --> 00:24:11.849
remote translation office projects

00:24:11.849 --> 00:24:13.849
are being developed.

00:24:13.849 --> 00:24:15.849
And in order to keep up

00:24:15.849 --> 00:24:17.849
with publisher growth,

00:24:17.849 --> 00:24:19.849
over five major

00:24:19.849 --> 00:24:21.849
kingdom hall projects

00:24:21.849 --> 00:24:23.849
need to be completed

00:24:23.849 --> 00:24:25.849
every single day.

00:24:25.849 --> 00:24:27.849
We are producing more videos,

00:24:27.849 --> 00:24:29.849
all of which feed our hope.

00:24:29.849 --> 00:24:31.849
That means we need more studio space.

00:24:31.849 --> 00:24:33.849
Since 2015,

00:24:33.849 --> 00:24:35.849
studios have been constructed

00:24:35.849 --> 00:24:37.849
in Canada,

00:24:37.849 --> 00:24:39.849
Britain,

00:24:39.849 --> 00:24:41.849
South Africa,

00:24:41.849 --> 00:24:43.849
and most recently,

00:24:43.849 --> 00:24:45.849
Australasia,

00:24:45.849 --> 00:24:47.849
where the good news,

00:24:47.849 --> 00:24:49.849
according to Jesus,

00:24:49.849 --> 00:24:51.849
is being produced.

00:24:51.849 --> 00:24:53.849
And coming soon,

00:24:53.849 --> 00:24:55.849
the new media center

00:24:55.849 --> 00:24:59.849
at Ramapo, New York.

00:24:59.849 --> 00:25:01.849
We have overwhelming evidence

00:25:01.849 --> 00:25:03.849
that Jehovah directs his people's

00:25:03.849 --> 00:25:05.849
efforts to build

00:25:05.849 --> 00:25:07.849
an advanced kingdom

00:25:07.849 --> 00:25:17.980
interests.

00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:19.980
But our most important

00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:21.980
building effort will always

00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:23.980
be our faith.

00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:25.980
Have you ever wondered

00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:27.980
if you could endure

00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:29.980
a severe trial,

00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:31.980
such as persecution?

00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:33.980
Please listen,

00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:35.980
as Brother Mark Sanderson

00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:37.980
of the governing body explains

00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:39.980
how we can receive peace

00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:41.980
from the situation.

00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:43.980
Our text this morning

00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:45.980
is so encouraging

00:25:45.980 --> 00:25:47.980
and so strengthening for us.

00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:49.980
It reminds us

00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:51.980
of a special type of peace

00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:53.980
that we can experience

00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:55.980
that's not dependent

00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:57.980
on our circumstances

00:25:57.980 --> 00:25:59.980
or on what's going on

00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:01.980
around us.

00:26:01.980 --> 00:26:03.980
How would you define

00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:05.980
that peace of God

00:26:05.980 --> 00:26:07.980
that's referred to in our text?

00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:09.980
Exactly is it?

00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:11.980
When our insight volume 2,

00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:13.980
page 592,

00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:15.980
says this,

00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:17.980
the peace of God

00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:19.980
that is the calmness

00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:21.980
and tranquility that result

00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:23.980
from a Christian's

00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:25.980
precious relationship

00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:27.980
with Jehovah God,

00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:29.980
guards his heart

00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:31.980
and mental powers

00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:33.980
from becoming anxious

00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:35.980
about his needs.

00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:37.980
Jehovah God provides for his servants

00:26:37.980 --> 00:26:39.980
and answers

00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:41.980
their prayers.

00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:43.980
This puts his heart and mind

00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:45.980
at rest.

00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:47.980
So now what do you understand

00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:49.980
from that definition?

00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:51.980
When if you look at Philippians

00:26:51.980 --> 00:26:53.980
chapter 4 and look at verses 6

00:26:53.980 --> 00:26:55.980
and 7 together,

00:26:55.980 --> 00:26:57.980
we understand from those verses

00:26:57.980 --> 00:26:59.980
that when we pour out

00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:01.980
our heart to Jehovah,

00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:03.980
when we supplicate him,

00:27:03.980 --> 00:27:05.980
when we beg him

00:27:05.980 --> 00:27:07.980
for his help.

00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:09.980
And when we do so with a thankful spirit,

00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:11.980
always being grateful for the good things

00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:13.980
that Jehovah gives us,

00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:15.980
being confident

00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:17.980
that he will bless us

00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:19.980
and he will help us,

00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:21.980
we can receive from Jehovah

00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:23.980
that wonderful calmness

00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:25.980
and tranquility that puts our minds

00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:27.980
and hearts to rest.

00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:29.980
Now as Paul goes on to say

00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:31.980
there in verse 7,

00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:33.980
that peace of God

00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:35.980
surpasses all understanding.

00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:37.980
Now let's look

00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:39.980
at some examples.

00:27:39.980 --> 00:27:41.980
First of all in the scriptures

00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:43.980
where we see individuals

00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:45.980
who experience that peace of God.

00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:47.980
Now first of all, let's go to Daniel chapter 3.

00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:51.829
Daniel chapter 3.

00:27:51.829 --> 00:27:53.829
And let's go down here

00:27:53.829 --> 00:27:55.829
in verse 16.

00:27:55.829 --> 00:27:57.829
And of course, now this is the account

00:27:57.829 --> 00:27:59.829
of Shadrach, Misha,

00:27:59.829 --> 00:28:01.829
and Abednego.

00:28:01.829 --> 00:28:03.829
And when it became evident

00:28:03.829 --> 00:28:05.829
that the Shadrach, Misha,

00:28:05.829 --> 00:28:07.829
and Abednego would not do this,

00:28:07.829 --> 00:28:09.829
they were brought before the king.

00:28:09.829 --> 00:28:11.829
Here's what they said.

00:28:11.829 --> 00:28:13.829
Look at verse 16.

00:28:13.829 --> 00:28:15.829
Oh, Nebuchadnezzar,

00:28:15.829 --> 00:28:17.829
we have no need to answer you

00:28:17.829 --> 00:28:19.829
in this matter.

00:28:19.829 --> 00:28:21.829
If it must be,

00:28:21.829 --> 00:28:23.829
our God whom we serve

00:28:23.829 --> 00:28:25.829
is able to rescue us

00:28:25.829 --> 00:28:27.829
from the burning fiery furnace,

00:28:27.829 --> 00:28:29.829
okay, and to rescue us

00:28:29.829 --> 00:28:30.829
from your hand.

00:28:30.829 --> 00:28:32.829
But even if he does not,

00:28:32.829 --> 00:28:34.829
let it be known to you, O king,

00:28:34.829 --> 00:28:38.829
that we will not serve your gods,

00:28:38.829 --> 00:28:40.829
or worship the image of gold

00:28:40.829 --> 00:28:42.829
that you have set up.

00:28:42.829 --> 00:28:44.829
Well now the Bible doesn't record

00:28:44.829 --> 00:28:46.829
the prayer, the Shadrach, Misha,

00:28:46.829 --> 00:28:48.829
and Abednego said.

00:28:48.829 --> 00:28:50.829
But when you listen to their words,

00:28:50.829 --> 00:28:52.829
do you hear their calm?

00:28:52.829 --> 00:28:54.829
Do you hear the tranquility

00:28:54.829 --> 00:28:56.829
in their voices?

00:28:56.829 --> 00:28:58.829
There's no panic here.

00:28:58.829 --> 00:29:00.829
There's no terror.

00:29:00.829 --> 00:29:02.829
They speak confidently

00:29:02.829 --> 00:29:04.829
and calmly with full trust

00:29:04.829 --> 00:29:06.829
in Jehovah.

00:29:06.829 --> 00:29:10.829
Well, as you look on to verse 19,

00:29:10.829 --> 00:29:12.829
you'll see that Nebuchadnezzar

00:29:12.829 --> 00:29:14.829
becomes furious at this.

00:29:14.829 --> 00:29:16.829
And he has the furnace heated seven times,

00:29:16.829 --> 00:29:18.829
hotter than normal.

00:29:18.829 --> 00:29:20.829
Verse 22 says that when the,

00:29:20.829 --> 00:29:22.829
that the king's command was so harsh

00:29:22.829 --> 00:29:24.829
and the furnace was so hot

00:29:24.829 --> 00:29:26.829
that the men

00:29:26.829 --> 00:29:28.829
who were to throw a Shadrach,

00:29:28.829 --> 00:29:30.829
Misha, Abednego, and they were all killed

00:29:30.829 --> 00:29:32.829
because the furnace was so hot.

00:29:32.829 --> 00:29:34.829
Brothers, this is,

00:29:34.829 --> 00:29:36.829
this is real.

00:29:36.829 --> 00:29:38.829
This is real persecution.

00:29:38.829 --> 00:29:40.829
This is real fire.

00:29:40.829 --> 00:29:42.829
But what happens?

00:29:42.829 --> 00:29:44.829
Look at verse 24.

00:29:44.829 --> 00:29:46.829
Nebuchadnezzar looks in the fire.

00:29:46.829 --> 00:29:48.829
He says, did we not tie up three men

00:29:48.829 --> 00:29:50.829
and throw them in the fire?

00:29:50.829 --> 00:29:52.829
Yes.

00:29:52.829 --> 00:29:54.829
He says, look,

00:29:54.829 --> 00:29:56.829
we're talking about free

00:29:56.829 --> 00:29:58.829
in the midst of the fire.

00:29:58.829 --> 00:30:00.829
And they are unharmed.

00:30:00.829 --> 00:30:02.829
And the fourth one looks like a son of the God,

00:30:02.829 --> 00:30:04.829
like a son of the gods.

00:30:04.829 --> 00:30:06.829
When you talk about

00:30:06.829 --> 00:30:08.829
peace of God,

00:30:08.829 --> 00:30:10.829
three men walking about

00:30:10.829 --> 00:30:12.829
in the fiery furnace,

00:30:12.829 --> 00:30:14.829
I wonder what they were saying.

00:30:14.829 --> 00:30:16.829
Well, what are you going to do today, Shadrach?

00:30:16.829 --> 00:30:18.829
What are we going to do when we get out of this fiery furnace?

00:30:18.829 --> 00:30:20.829
You see, not,

00:30:20.829 --> 00:30:22.829
not in terror,

00:30:22.829 --> 00:30:24.829
of comeness.

00:30:24.829 --> 00:30:26.829
That's the peace of God.

00:30:26.829 --> 00:30:28.829
What about Jehoshaphat?

00:30:28.829 --> 00:30:32.829
In 2 Chronicles chapter 20.

00:30:32.829 --> 00:30:34.829
Let's look at this one too.

00:30:34.829 --> 00:30:36.829
2 Chronicles chapter 20.

00:30:36.829 --> 00:30:40.240
Now you'll see here,

00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:42.240
Jehoshaphat and the people of Judah

00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:44.240
are surrounded by enemy armies.

00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:48.240
Verse 12, look at what he says in his prayer.

00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:50.240
We are powerless

00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:52.240
before this large crowd

00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:53.240
that is coming against us.

00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:55.240
We do not know what we should do,

00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:59.240
but our eyes are toward you.

00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:01.240
Imagine the concern in his heart.

00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:03.240
Look at verse 13.

00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:05.240
You see, it says that all those of Judah

00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:07.240
were standing before Jehovah,

00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:09.240
including their little ones,

00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:11.240
their wives, and their children.

00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:13.240
See, Jehoshaphat was

00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:15.240
perhaps a little bit

00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:17.240
in a state of anxiety here,

00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:19.240
saying Jehovah, we just don't know what to do.

00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:21.240
But just like Philippians 4, 6, and 7 says,

00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:23.240
Jehoshaphat supplicated Jehovah.

00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:25.240
He begged him for his help.

00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:27.240
He had a thankful heart,

00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:29.240
even recounting the ways that Jehovah

00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:31.240
had blessed the nation.

00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:33.240
And what happened?

00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:35.240
Well, the message came from Jehovah in verse 15.

00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:37.240
Do not be afraid or be terrified

00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:39.240
because of this large crowd.

00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:41.240
For the battle is not yours,

00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:43.240
but God's.

00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:45.240
And verse 17.

00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:47.240
Jehovah told him,

00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:49.240
you will not need to fight this battle.

00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:51.240
Take your position.

00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:53.240
Stand still.

00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:55.240
See the salvation of Jehovah in your behalf.

00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:59.240
Do not be afraid or be terrified.

00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:01.240
Well, there's immediately

00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:03.240
a different spirit in Jehoshaphat.

00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:05.240
You can tell that he's experienced

00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:07.240
the peace of God because

00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:09.240
look at verse 20 and 21.

00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:11.240
Immediately says to the people,

00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:13.240
listen to me, oh Judah,

00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:15.240
and you inhabitants of Jerusalem.

00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:17.240
Put faith in Jehovah our God

00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:19.240
so that you may be able to stand firm.

00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:21.240
Put faith in his prophets

00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:23.240
and you will be successful.

00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:25.240
And then he appointed

00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:27.240
men to go out and sayings

00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:29.240
and go before the armies of Israel

00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:31.240
as they praised Jehovah.

00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:33.240
Well, as a result, of course,

00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:35.240
the nation was saved.

00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:37.240
Jehoshaphat experienced

00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:39.240
that calmness,

00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:41.240
that tranquility,

00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:43.240
that comes from the peace

00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:45.240
that only God can give.

00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:47.240
Well, the same is true in our modern times.

00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:49.240
In the 1975,

00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:51.240
your books, a beautiful experience

00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:53.240
about our dear brother,

00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:55.240
Daniel Sidlik, who served on the governing body.

00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:57.240
He was jailed

00:32:57.240 --> 00:32:59.240
because of his Christian neutrality

00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:01.240
in 1944.

00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:03.240
On his first night in prison,

00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:05.240
he was lying on top of his bunk

00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:07.240
and he was listening

00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:09.240
as the steel gates.

00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:11.240
He says like rumbling thunder

00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:13.240
rolled to a close.

00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:15.240
One by one, the sound of those gates

00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:17.240
came closer and closer

00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:19.240
until his cell gate

00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:21.240
quivered and then rolled

00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:23.240
slowly shut.

00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:25.240
He said suddenly

00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:27.240
an overwhelmingly

00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:29.240
sickening sensation

00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:31.240
swept over me,

00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:33.240
which made me feel trapped

00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:35.240
without a way out.

00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:37.240
Then, just as quickly

00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:39.240
followed another sensation

00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:41.240
equally overwhelming,

00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:43.240
which made me feel great peace and joy,

00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:45.240
the kind of peace

00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:47.240
that the Bible speaks about,

00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:49.240
the peace of God

00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:51.240
that surpasses

00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:53.240
all understanding.

00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:55.240
Isn't that wonderful?

00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:57.240
How about this one?

00:33:57.240 --> 00:33:59.240
This is a farewell letter

00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:01.240
that a young brother wrote

00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:03.240
to his parents

00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:05.240
during the time of Nazi Germany.

00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:07.240
This is what he wrote to them.

00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:09.239
It is now nine o'clock

00:34:09.239 --> 00:34:11.239
on the day of my trial,

00:34:11.239 --> 00:34:13.239
but I must wait till 1130.

00:34:13.239 --> 00:34:15.239
I am writing these lines

00:34:15.239 --> 00:34:17.239
in a solitary cell of the

00:34:17.239 --> 00:34:19.239
state military court.

00:34:19.239 --> 00:34:21.239
I have such peace,

00:34:21.239 --> 00:34:23.239
which is really hardly believable,

00:34:23.239 --> 00:34:25.239
but I have also committed all

00:34:25.239 --> 00:34:27.239
to the Lord so that I can calmly wait

00:34:27.239 --> 00:34:29.239
for that hour.

00:34:29.239 --> 00:34:31.239
Then, at 1230, he continued his letter.

00:34:31.239 --> 00:34:33.239
It's all over now.

00:34:33.239 --> 00:34:36.239
In view of the fact that I maintained my objection,

00:34:36.239 --> 00:34:38.239
the death sentence was decreed.

00:34:38.239 --> 00:34:40.239
I listened,

00:34:40.239 --> 00:34:42.239
and then after I had spoken the words,

00:34:42.239 --> 00:34:44.239
be thou faithful unto death,

00:34:44.239 --> 00:34:46.239
and a few other words of our Lord,

00:34:46.239 --> 00:34:48.239
it was all over.

00:34:48.239 --> 00:34:50.239
But never mind that now.

00:34:50.239 --> 00:34:52.239
I have such peace,

00:34:52.239 --> 00:34:54.239
such tranquility

00:34:54.239 --> 00:34:56.239
that you can't possibly imagine.

00:34:56.239 --> 00:34:58.239
Isn't that amazing?

00:34:58.239 --> 00:35:00.239
The peace of God

00:35:00.239 --> 00:35:02.239
came upon that dear brother

00:35:02.239 --> 00:35:04.239
before he was executed.

00:35:04.239 --> 00:35:06.239
Well, now in Russia,

00:35:06.239 --> 00:35:08.239
our brothers are facing armed

00:35:08.239 --> 00:35:10.239
and masked men,

00:35:10.239 --> 00:35:12.239
breaking down their doors of their homes,

00:35:12.239 --> 00:35:14.239
doing home searches,

00:35:14.239 --> 00:35:16.239
breaking up meetings, court cases,

00:35:16.239 --> 00:35:18.239
imprisonment.

00:35:18.239 --> 00:35:20.239
But there are so many wonderful experiences

00:35:20.239 --> 00:35:22.239
of how Jehovah has given the peace of God

00:35:22.239 --> 00:35:24.239
to our brothers.

00:35:24.239 --> 00:35:26.239
During one search on a brother's home,

00:35:26.239 --> 00:35:28.239
the brother began to worry

00:35:28.239 --> 00:35:30.239
in feeling anxiety.

00:35:30.239 --> 00:35:32.239
He prayed to Jehovah,

00:35:32.239 --> 00:35:34.239
I don't know what to do.

00:35:34.239 --> 00:35:36.239
But then the investigator

00:35:36.239 --> 00:35:38.239
doing the home search

00:35:38.239 --> 00:35:40.239
began looking at the magnets

00:35:40.239 --> 00:35:42.239
on the brother's refrigerator,

00:35:42.239 --> 00:35:44.239
and loudly and expressively

00:35:44.239 --> 00:35:46.239
read the inscription on one of the fridge magnets,

00:35:46.239 --> 00:35:48.239
do not be anxious

00:35:48.239 --> 00:35:51.679
for I am your God.

00:35:51.679 --> 00:35:53.679
The brother, right away,

00:35:53.679 --> 00:35:55.679
understood what he needed to do.

00:35:55.679 --> 00:35:57.679
Well, brothers, what's the point?

00:35:57.679 --> 00:36:01.679
Regardless of what may be happening around us,

00:36:01.679 --> 00:36:03.679
what persecution we may face,

00:36:03.679 --> 00:36:07.679
how challenging the situation may be.

00:36:07.679 --> 00:36:09.679
If we supplicate Jehovah

00:36:09.679 --> 00:36:11.679
with a thankful heart,

00:36:11.679 --> 00:36:13.679
he will give us a precious gift,

00:36:13.679 --> 00:36:15.679
the peace of God

00:36:15.679 --> 00:36:19.679
that surpasses all understanding.

00:36:19.679 --> 00:36:21.679
How refreshing

00:36:21.679 --> 00:36:23.679
that if we look to Jehovah

00:36:23.679 --> 00:36:25.679
for the way out of a trial,

00:36:25.679 --> 00:36:27.679
he'll help us to endure

00:36:27.679 --> 00:36:31.019
with inner peace and calm.

00:36:31.019 --> 00:36:33.019
Something that could disturb our inner peace

00:36:33.019 --> 00:36:37.019
is conflict in a marriage.

00:36:37.019 --> 00:36:39.019
How can respect

00:36:39.019 --> 00:36:41.019
help a couple reduce conflict

00:36:41.019 --> 00:36:43.019
and maintain peace?

00:36:43.019 --> 00:36:45.019
Let's see in this episode of

00:36:45.019 --> 00:36:47.019
For a Happy Marriage.

00:36:47.019 --> 00:37:06.559
Respect.

00:37:06.559 --> 00:37:09.809
Sometimes

00:37:09.809 --> 00:37:11.809
we work so hard to show it

00:37:11.809 --> 00:37:15.789
but receive little in return.

00:37:15.789 --> 00:37:33.219
The question is

00:37:33.219 --> 00:37:35.219
does it really have to be that way

00:37:35.219 --> 00:37:37.219
at home?

00:37:37.219 --> 00:37:50.099
We might need to change habits

00:37:50.099 --> 00:37:52.099
that we learn growing up

00:37:52.099 --> 00:38:01.260
or we may realize

00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:05.260
that we need to change our choice of entertainment.

00:38:05.260 --> 00:38:07.260
While it may not be easy,

00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:09.260
it is possible to cultivate

00:38:09.260 --> 00:38:13.260
the mutual respect we once had.

00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:15.260
A helpful principle

00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:17.260
was stated long ago in the Bible.

00:38:17.260 --> 00:38:19.260
Just as you want others to do

00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:29.820
to you, do the same way to them.

00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:48.610
Husbands especially need to feel respected.

00:38:48.610 --> 00:38:52.610
But wives also need to feel valued.

00:38:52.610 --> 00:38:54.610
Loved.

00:38:54.610 --> 00:38:58.610
And heard by their husbands.

00:38:58.610 --> 00:39:00.610
If we start by doing things

00:39:00.610 --> 00:39:02.610
that show we honor our mate,

00:39:02.610 --> 00:39:04.610
we'll create an atmosphere

00:39:04.610 --> 00:39:06.610
where respect can grow.

00:39:06.610 --> 00:39:19.900
Always remember to consider

00:39:19.900 --> 00:39:21.900
how your words

00:39:21.900 --> 00:39:25.820
will affect your mate.

00:39:25.820 --> 00:39:32.460
Whether in public

00:39:32.460 --> 00:39:35.869
or even in private.

00:39:35.869 --> 00:39:37.869
If you must correct a matter,

00:39:37.869 --> 00:39:39.869
wait until you're alone.

00:39:39.869 --> 00:39:41.869
Use a kind tone

00:39:41.869 --> 00:39:43.869
and gentle speech.

00:39:43.869 --> 00:39:45.869
Even when you disagree,

00:39:45.869 --> 00:40:01.809
keep showing that you value your mate's opinion.

00:40:01.809 --> 00:40:03.809
Think about everything your spouse does.

00:40:03.809 --> 00:40:08.460
Both the big things

00:40:08.460 --> 00:40:12.460
and the little things.

00:40:12.460 --> 00:40:14.460
To take good care of your family,

00:40:14.460 --> 00:40:28.079
try not to focus

00:40:28.079 --> 00:40:30.079
on your mate's flaws.

00:40:30.079 --> 00:40:37.900
Commend.

00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:57.730
More than you criticize.

00:40:57.730 --> 00:40:59.730
Until you're made every day,

00:40:59.730 --> 00:41:03.730
something specific you appreciate about them.

00:41:03.730 --> 00:41:05.730
Peace is the beautiful result

00:41:05.730 --> 00:41:07.730
when both husband and wife

00:41:07.730 --> 00:41:09.730
show respect to the person

00:41:09.730 --> 00:41:11.730
who deserves it most.

00:41:11.730 --> 00:41:15.329
One another.

00:41:15.329 --> 00:41:17.329
Here are three questions for you to discuss

00:41:17.329 --> 00:41:19.329
that can help to build respect in your marriage.

00:41:19.329 --> 00:41:21.329
This is simply a chance

00:41:21.329 --> 00:41:25.329
to openly express how each of you feels.

00:41:25.329 --> 00:41:27.329
Be ready to listen

00:41:27.329 --> 00:41:29.329
and willing to change.

00:41:29.329 --> 00:41:31.329
So, if it's convenient,

00:41:31.329 --> 00:41:33.329
pause this video now

00:41:33.329 --> 00:41:39.840
and really talk.

00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:41.840
Did you catch that?

00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:43.840
For a happy marriage,

00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:45.840
show respect to the person

00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:47.840
who truly deserves it,

00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:51.150
your mate.

00:41:51.150 --> 00:41:53.150
Even if a couple works well together,

00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:55.150
children may demand greater teamwork.

00:41:55.150 --> 00:41:59.150
Note the way the Macias family is teaching their son

00:41:59.150 --> 00:42:03.150
with special needs to build a relationship with Jehovah.

00:42:03.150 --> 00:42:05.150
So, when I saw my son

00:42:05.150 --> 00:42:07.150
for the first time,

00:42:07.150 --> 00:42:09.150
I saw his big eyes open.

00:42:09.150 --> 00:42:11.150
I just thought, Jehovah,

00:42:11.150 --> 00:42:13.150
what a blessing he's given to me.

00:42:13.150 --> 00:42:15.150
I couldn't believe that this was

00:42:15.150 --> 00:42:17.150
our boy.

00:42:17.150 --> 00:42:19.150
It was overwhelming.

00:42:19.150 --> 00:42:21.150
When I was told

00:42:21.150 --> 00:42:23.150
that Jaden is autistic,

00:42:23.150 --> 00:42:25.150
I didn't know what it was.

00:42:25.150 --> 00:42:27.150
So, I immediately started

00:42:27.150 --> 00:42:29.150
doing my homework.

00:42:29.150 --> 00:42:31.150
I need to know what it is

00:42:31.150 --> 00:42:33.150
so I can succeed

00:42:33.150 --> 00:42:35.150
because I love this boy

00:42:35.150 --> 00:42:37.150
and I don't want to fail him.

00:42:37.150 --> 00:42:39.150
Being a new mom,

00:42:39.150 --> 00:42:41.150
I started doing the research

00:42:41.150 --> 00:42:43.150
and talking to my pediatrician.

00:42:43.150 --> 00:42:45.150
Every day was like a mystery

00:42:45.150 --> 00:42:47.150
and you need that time to process together

00:42:47.150 --> 00:42:49.150
and we're like,

00:42:49.150 --> 00:42:51.150
it was key to talk to Jehovah

00:42:51.150 --> 00:42:53.150
because this can be overwhelming,

00:42:53.150 --> 00:42:55.150
just trying to understand

00:42:55.150 --> 00:42:57.150
the challenges that you have

00:42:57.150 --> 00:42:59.150
to prepare yourself for

00:42:59.150 --> 00:43:01.150
to endure as an advocate

00:43:01.150 --> 00:43:03.150
for your child.

00:43:03.150 --> 00:43:05.150
I think being present

00:43:05.150 --> 00:43:07.150
in our case has been very important

00:43:07.150 --> 00:43:09.150
with Jaden

00:43:09.150 --> 00:43:11.150
because there's just glimpses

00:43:11.150 --> 00:43:13.150
of his personality

00:43:13.150 --> 00:43:15.150
that you're able to capture

00:43:15.150 --> 00:43:17.150
and you might not see it again.

00:43:17.150 --> 00:43:19.150
So, those are the things

00:43:19.150 --> 00:43:21.150
that drive us.

00:43:21.150 --> 00:43:23.150
We've been fortunate

00:43:23.150 --> 00:43:25.150
enough to have such a

00:43:25.150 --> 00:43:27.150
strong set of friends

00:43:27.150 --> 00:43:29.150
they're the ones that call us

00:43:29.150 --> 00:43:31.150
and say,

00:43:31.150 --> 00:43:33.150
are you doing?

00:43:33.150 --> 00:43:35.150
You know, outside

00:43:35.150 --> 00:43:37.150
of Jaden,

00:43:37.150 --> 00:43:39.150
how are you doing?

00:43:39.150 --> 00:43:41.150
What's keeping you going?

00:43:41.150 --> 00:43:43.150
You know, those are

00:43:43.150 --> 00:43:45.150
the things that really

00:43:45.150 --> 00:43:47.150
stay with us

00:43:47.150 --> 00:43:49.150
and help us just keep moving

00:43:49.150 --> 00:43:51.150
along and show you

00:43:51.150 --> 00:43:53.150
along.

00:43:53.150 --> 00:43:55.150
Jaden's vocabulary is

00:43:55.150 --> 00:43:57.150
limited. If he's angry,

00:43:57.150 --> 00:43:59.150
we ask him, are you feeling

00:43:59.150 --> 00:44:01.150
angry? Yes, angry.

00:44:01.150 --> 00:44:03.150
Well, why?

00:44:03.150 --> 00:44:05.150
I don't know.

00:44:05.150 --> 00:44:07.150
Okay. Well, what happened?

00:44:07.150 --> 00:44:09.150
I'll take a picture

00:44:09.150 --> 00:44:11.150
with my phone. You see?

00:44:11.150 --> 00:44:13.150
You don't look happy.

00:44:13.150 --> 00:44:15.150
You know?

00:44:15.150 --> 00:44:17.150
And then I'll find a picture

00:44:17.150 --> 00:44:19.150
with him happy. I'm like,

00:44:19.150 --> 00:44:21.150
that's Jaden right there

00:44:21.150 --> 00:44:23.150
and then we work at it.

00:44:23.150 --> 00:44:25.150
But I think it helps him to see it

00:44:25.150 --> 00:44:27.150
because he sees himself

00:44:27.150 --> 00:44:30.590
and with Jaden

00:44:30.590 --> 00:44:32.590
reading words, writing words

00:44:32.590 --> 00:44:34.590
is not really the thing

00:44:34.590 --> 00:44:36.590
that's going to cement

00:44:36.590 --> 00:44:38.590
anything into his heart or brain.

00:44:38.590 --> 00:44:40.590
So, most of it is going to be

00:44:40.590 --> 00:44:42.590
drawn or acted out.

00:44:42.590 --> 00:44:44.590
And he loves the Sophia

00:44:44.590 --> 00:44:46.590
and Kayla videos. When that came,

00:44:46.590 --> 00:44:48.590
we were just so grateful to Jehovah

00:44:48.590 --> 00:44:50.590
because it really felt like

00:44:50.590 --> 00:44:52.590
it was made for us.

00:44:52.590 --> 00:44:54.590
We had the illustrated

00:44:54.590 --> 00:44:56.590
Bible stories. It had dialogue,

00:44:56.590 --> 00:44:58.590
an action tile. I would act

00:44:58.590 --> 00:45:00.590
those out with him.

00:45:00.590 --> 00:45:02.590
When we prepare for assembly,

00:45:02.590 --> 00:45:04.590
we sing the songs

00:45:04.590 --> 00:45:06.590
throughout the whole program

00:45:06.590 --> 00:45:08.590
so that he feels that he has

00:45:08.590 --> 00:45:10.590
an idea of what's coming.

00:45:10.590 --> 00:45:12.590
And we realized we need to move

00:45:12.590 --> 00:45:14.590
to the English congregation

00:45:14.590 --> 00:45:16.590
so that Jaden could thrive.

00:45:16.590 --> 00:45:18.590
It's been a fun ride

00:45:18.590 --> 00:45:20.590
with getting Jaden to comment

00:45:20.590 --> 00:45:22.590
at meetings, telling the friends,

00:45:22.590 --> 00:45:24.590
hey, you know, he wants to come

00:45:24.590 --> 00:45:26.590
but it's going to be

00:45:26.590 --> 00:45:28.590
maybe something you don't understand.

00:45:28.590 --> 00:45:30.590
And they were so good about it.

00:45:30.590 --> 00:45:32.590
That constant support

00:45:32.590 --> 00:45:34.590
was enough for him to want to do it on his own.

00:45:34.590 --> 00:45:36.590
So, he knows that we have to share our faith.

00:45:36.590 --> 00:45:38.590
He knows that others don't have our hope.

00:45:38.590 --> 00:45:40.590
So, that means we're publishers to get that done.

00:45:40.590 --> 00:45:42.590
So, we help them to get to that place.

00:45:42.590 --> 00:45:44.590
He's going to talk about his faith.

00:45:44.590 --> 00:45:46.590
He's going to share it the way he can.

00:45:46.590 --> 00:45:48.590
He wants to get baptized.

00:45:48.590 --> 00:45:54.429
Yeah, I think that, you know,

00:45:54.429 --> 00:45:56.429
when we make it to the new world,

00:45:56.429 --> 00:45:58.429
he's going to know everything

00:45:58.429 --> 00:46:00.429
that's been done to get us there

00:46:00.429 --> 00:46:07.199
and to be there as a family.

00:46:07.199 --> 00:46:18.480
I score, sir. So many.

00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:20.480
I think of

00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:27.010
us being over hill for some reason.

00:46:27.010 --> 00:46:31.010
And think of him being between us

00:46:31.010 --> 00:46:35.010
because that's how he's kind of the dynamic.

00:46:35.010 --> 00:46:37.010
Him holding us and saying we did it.

00:46:37.010 --> 00:46:39.010
We did it together.

00:46:39.010 --> 00:46:41.010
Jehovah is giving us the best gift,

00:46:41.010 --> 00:46:43.010
which is our son, Jaden.

00:46:43.010 --> 00:46:47.980
You'll be glad to know

00:46:47.980 --> 00:46:49.980
that shortly after this video was filmed,

00:46:49.980 --> 00:46:51.980
Jaden symbolized his dedication

00:46:51.980 --> 00:46:53.980
by water baptism.

00:46:53.980 --> 00:46:58.900
Have you ever had a doubt

00:46:58.900 --> 00:47:00.900
that weakened your faith?

00:47:00.900 --> 00:47:02.900
Do you struggle to believe

00:47:02.900 --> 00:47:04.900
that God loves you?

00:47:04.900 --> 00:47:06.900
This month's music video

00:47:06.900 --> 00:47:08.900
encourages us to face those doubts

00:47:08.900 --> 00:47:10.900
with Jehovah's help.

00:47:10.900 --> 00:47:14.429
He's a true

00:47:14.429 --> 00:47:16.429
that this is the path

00:47:16.429 --> 00:47:18.429
I should choose.

00:47:18.429 --> 00:47:20.429
I asked myself

00:47:20.429 --> 00:47:26.539
I had a mind full of questions

00:47:26.539 --> 00:47:28.539
and not to mention

00:47:28.539 --> 00:47:30.539
this world didn't help

00:47:30.539 --> 00:47:34.500
but I made the time

00:47:34.500 --> 00:47:38.500
to prove I really have the truth

00:47:38.500 --> 00:47:45.139
when I have to deal

00:47:45.139 --> 00:47:49.139
with what distorts my view.

00:47:49.139 --> 00:47:51.139
This is what I do.

00:47:51.139 --> 00:51:09.489
My hope is guaranteed.

00:51:09.489 --> 00:51:11.489
Jehovah always gives us

00:51:11.489 --> 00:51:13.489
just what we need.

00:51:13.489 --> 00:51:15.489
True hope is built

00:51:15.489 --> 00:51:17.489
on the promises of a God

00:51:17.489 --> 00:51:19.489
who simply cannot lie.

00:51:19.489 --> 00:51:21.489
Whether we are young or old,

00:51:21.489 --> 00:51:23.489
our hope can stabilize us

00:51:23.489 --> 00:51:25.489
through both man-made conflict

00:51:25.489 --> 00:51:27.489
or natural disasters.

00:51:27.489 --> 00:51:29.489
Theocratic building projects

00:51:29.489 --> 00:51:31.489
are tangible evidence

00:51:31.489 --> 00:51:33.489
that the God of hope is speeding

00:51:33.489 --> 00:51:35.489
up the global preaching work

00:51:35.489 --> 00:51:37.489
before the end comes.

00:51:37.489 --> 00:51:39.489
And when we apply Bible principles

00:51:39.489 --> 00:51:41.489
in our marriage,

00:51:41.489 --> 00:51:43.489
our hope is strengthened

00:51:43.489 --> 00:51:45.489
as we see how Jehovah's word promotes peace

00:51:45.489 --> 00:51:47.489
in our home.

00:51:47.489 --> 00:51:49.489
Our postcard this month

00:51:49.489 --> 00:51:51.489
is from a country that's been called

00:51:51.489 --> 00:51:53.489
of the volcanoes,

00:51:53.489 --> 00:51:55.489
El Salvador.

00:51:55.489 --> 00:51:57.489
Of its 20 youngest volcanoes,

00:51:57.489 --> 00:51:59.489
some are still active.

00:51:59.489 --> 00:52:01.489
The picturesque lake

00:52:01.489 --> 00:52:03.489
Quatapeque was formed

00:52:03.489 --> 00:52:05.489
when a group of volcanoes collapsed,

00:52:05.489 --> 00:52:07.489
allowing rainwater to fill the crater.

00:52:07.489 --> 00:52:09.489
Despite its mountainous terrain,

00:52:09.489 --> 00:52:11.489
El Salvador is known

00:52:11.489 --> 00:52:13.489
for its agriculture,

00:52:13.489 --> 00:52:15.489
especially coffee.

00:52:15.489 --> 00:52:17.489
The fertile volcanic soil

00:52:17.489 --> 00:52:19.489
produces a highly sought-after coffee

00:52:19.489 --> 00:52:21.489
in its sweetness,

00:52:21.489 --> 00:52:23.489
notes of chocolate

00:52:23.489 --> 00:52:25.489
and caramel

00:52:25.489 --> 00:52:27.489
and gentle acidity.

00:52:27.489 --> 00:52:29.489
El Salvador is

00:52:29.489 --> 00:52:31.489
Central America's smallest country

00:52:31.489 --> 00:52:33.489
and also its most densely populated.

00:52:33.489 --> 00:52:35.489
Jehovah's Witnesses

00:52:35.489 --> 00:52:37.489
have been active in the country

00:52:37.489 --> 00:52:39.489
since the first missionaries

00:52:39.489 --> 00:52:41.489
arrived in 1945.

00:52:41.489 --> 00:52:43.489
Those intrepid missionaries

00:52:43.489 --> 00:52:45.489
faced the daunting task

00:52:45.489 --> 00:52:47.489
of declaring the good news

00:52:47.489 --> 00:52:49.489
before and people are kind

00:52:49.489 --> 00:52:51.489
and industrious, very hospitable

00:52:51.489 --> 00:52:53.489
and ready to talk about the Bible.

00:52:53.489 --> 00:52:55.489
Those first seeds

00:52:55.489 --> 00:52:57.489
of kingdom truth grew rapidly

00:52:57.489 --> 00:52:59.489
and in 1972,

00:52:59.489 --> 00:53:01.489
Jehovah's Witnesses gained

00:53:01.489 --> 00:53:03.489
legal recognition.

00:53:03.489 --> 00:53:05.489
Today, the more than

00:53:05.489 --> 00:53:07.489
37,000 publishers

00:53:07.489 --> 00:53:09.489
conduct almost 20,000 Bible studies.

00:53:09.489 --> 00:53:11.489
They preach in Spanish,

00:53:11.489 --> 00:53:13.489
Salvador in sign language

00:53:13.489 --> 00:53:15.489
and Mandarin Chinese

00:53:15.489 --> 00:53:17.489
and they declare the good news

00:53:17.489 --> 00:53:19.489
to inmates in 20 different prisons.

00:53:19.489 --> 00:53:23.489
Nearly one in seven publishers

00:53:23.489 --> 00:53:25.489
serves as a pioneer.

00:53:25.489 --> 00:53:27.489
This past service year saw

00:53:27.489 --> 00:53:29.489
more than a 20% increase

00:53:29.489 --> 00:53:31.489
in total hours spent preaching.

00:53:31.489 --> 00:53:33.489
The brothers enjoy harbor witnessing

00:53:33.489 --> 00:53:35.489
in the coastal town of

00:53:35.489 --> 00:53:37.489
Acahulta.

00:53:37.489 --> 00:53:39.489
The El Boquerón congregation

00:53:39.489 --> 00:53:41.489
is located in the coffee-growing region

00:53:41.489 --> 00:53:43.489
of El Progreso la Libertad.

00:53:43.489 --> 00:53:45.489
After a delicious cup

00:53:45.489 --> 00:53:47.489
in the morning,

00:53:47.489 --> 00:53:49.489
the brothers walk from house to house

00:53:49.489 --> 00:53:51.489
and farm to farm.

00:53:51.489 --> 00:53:53.489
They conduct on average 50 Bible studies

00:53:53.489 --> 00:53:55.489
and this past year,

00:53:55.489 --> 00:53:59.489
174 attended the memorial.

00:53:59.489 --> 00:54:01.489
The 66 publishers

00:54:01.489 --> 00:54:03.489
of the El Boquerón congregation

00:54:03.489 --> 00:54:05.489
send their warm Christian love

00:54:05.489 --> 00:54:07.489
and affection.

00:54:07.489 --> 00:54:09.489
From the world headquarters

00:54:09.489 --> 00:54:11.489
of Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:54:11.489 --> 00:54:13.489
W Broadcasting.
