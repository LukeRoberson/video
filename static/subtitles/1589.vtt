00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:16.190
Thanks.

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:17.190
You're Lily, right?

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.190
Yeah, and you're Sean.

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:20.190
Yeah, I've seen you around.

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:23.190
You play a good basketball.

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:24.190
Thanks.

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:25.190
So do you.

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.190
So you want to hang out some time?

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:28.190
Sure.

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:36.979
My name is Lily, and I sort of have this problem.

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:42.420
There's a boy named Sean that recently moved to our school.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.420
I know I'm not supposed to like anyone who's not a witness.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.420
The trouble was he is a witness.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.420
Sean and his family moved into our congregation.

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.420
And the more I saw of him, the more I liked him.

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:32.200
Like I said, I had a problem.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:40.390
Every day I see couples my age at school.

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.739
To me, they look happy.

00:01:44.739 --> 00:01:50.549
Honestly, I wanted that happiness too.

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:58.010
My parents noticed my problem too.

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.010
And talked about it that night.

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:07.150
I'm pretty soon.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.150
I didn't feel alone anymore.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:15.150
The next day, my mom invited me to go with her to run an errand.

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.150
Afterward, we went to a little cafe.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.150
She asked me how things were going.

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.150
At first, I didn't want to tell her.

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.150
But she made me feel really comfortable.

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.150
So I told her my feelings for Sean.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.150
Expecting her to think that of me.

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.150
But she didn't.

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.150
Everything you're feeling is naturally.

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.150
I remember having the same feelings when I was your age too.

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.150
Really?

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:44.150
It's true.

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.150
That's just how Jehovah created us honey.

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:53.150
And because he created us, he knows the best way for us to be happy.

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.150
And that's all he wants for us.

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.150
And that's all daddy, and I want for you too.

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.150
She didn't scold me.

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.150
She didn't make me feel embarrassed.

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:10.150
And most importantly, she didn't seem to be in a rush.

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.150
My mom wasn't the only one helping me.

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.150
My dad was preparing to help me with my problem too.

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.150
That evening, we had family worship.

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.150
And once again, they just let me talk.

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.150
I told me I didn't have to hold back.

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:27.150
So I didn't.

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.150
I just don't know what to do.

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.150
Lily, thank you for telling us how you feel.

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.150
Let me ask you something.

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:41.150
Why do you think Jehovah created us with these natural feelings toward the opposite sex?

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.150
So that one day a man or woman can marry.

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.150
That's right.

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:51.150
In fact, a good marriage is like two skaters on the ice.

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.150
A beautiful performance can seem effortless, but is it really?

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.150
No.

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:01.150
No one would even attempt that without practice, a capable partner,

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.150
or the right kind of guidance, right?

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.150
Yeah.

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.150
Well, it's the same with a good marriage, sweetie.

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.150
It doesn't just happen.

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:16.149
It too depends on a good partner, coordinated effort,

00:04:16.149 --> 00:04:21.149
but most importantly, wise counsel from Jehovah.

00:04:21.149 --> 00:04:28.149
In fact, could you please turn with me to Psalm chapter 32 and verse 8,

00:04:28.149 --> 00:04:30.149
and read that for us?

00:04:30.149 --> 00:04:31.149
Sure.

00:04:31.149 --> 00:04:37.149
It says, I will give you insight and instruct you in the way you should go.

00:04:37.149 --> 00:04:41.149
I will give you advice with my eye upon you.

00:04:41.149 --> 00:04:44.149
Lily, Jehovah loves us very much.

00:04:44.149 --> 00:04:49.149
And if we listen to him, we'll make good decisions in our life

00:04:49.149 --> 00:04:52.149
with absolutely no regrets.

00:04:52.149 --> 00:04:56.149
We talk some more, and then I got some homework.

00:04:56.149 --> 00:05:00.149
My dad gave me some articles he printed out for me to read.

00:05:00.149 --> 00:05:03.850
So I did.

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:07.850
As I read the words and started meditating on them,

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:10.850
I realized something.

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:14.850
By holding off dating a little longer, I wasn't missing out.

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:21.019
Rather, I was preparing myself.

00:05:21.019 --> 00:05:26.019
I could use the time now to focus on something much more important.

00:05:26.019 --> 00:05:30.019
My relationship with Jehovah.

00:05:30.019 --> 00:05:35.019
I could also gain Christian qualities and experience that will help me later

00:05:35.019 --> 00:05:38.019
if I ever do get married.
