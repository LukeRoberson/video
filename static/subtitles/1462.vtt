00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:36.509
The wonderful truths about Jehovah and his purples have touched the hearts of millions

00:00:36.509 --> 00:00:51.179
of people of life.

00:00:51.179 --> 00:00:57.420
This has moved many to visit the branch offices of Jehovah's Witnesses in countries around

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:06.510
the world.

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.549
Why are such branch offices necessary?

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:25.019
In order for life-giving truths to reach everyone, the preaching work must be organized.

00:01:25.019 --> 00:01:36.980
A branch committee oversees all Bethel operations.

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:49.780
These brothers also look after the preaching work throughout the branch territory.

00:01:49.780 --> 00:02:11.009
Our translation teams translate articles and videos into several local languages.

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:31.409
These are recorded and made available on JW4 or sent electronically for printing.

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:37.409
The activity of traveling overseas as well as nearly 200 special pioneers and missionaries

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:43.620
is coordinated by the service department.

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:50.099
These brothers also take care of organizing the more than 130 congregations throughout

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:59.080
the branch territory.

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:09.009
With the growth of Kingdom interests, comes a constant need for more theocratic buildings.

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:14.449
The local design and construction department cares for construction projects such as Kingdom

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:16.449
Halls and Assembly Halls.

00:03:16.449 --> 00:04:00.060
It also cares for operating and maintaining these buildings.

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:05.300
Jehovah's Witnesses have a deep respect for life and one of the best possible medical

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:06.460
care.

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:13.139
The hospital information deck provides assistance with non-blood medical management.

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:23.459
It coordinates with hospital leaders on committees and cooperative doctors around the country.

00:04:23.459 --> 00:04:29.060
A lack of transport and poor road conditions make it really a challenge for HRC members

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.660
to travel around the country to visit the hospitals and the clinics.

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:37.740
But their self-sacrificing spirit and the love they have for the brothers, along with

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:43.180
some fine medical presentations, have really had a positive effect on many doctors and

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:48.300
hospital staff who are now willing to use non-blood treatment in working with our brothers

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:49.899
and sisters.

00:04:49.899 --> 00:04:55.459
So we can honestly say that we have seen Jehovah's rich bless in and direction on the work

00:04:55.459 --> 00:05:13.199
of the HRC brothers.

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:18.959
All who live and work here are part of what we call the Bethel family.

00:05:18.959 --> 00:05:37.949
We call it a family because that is how we truly feel about one another.

00:05:37.949 --> 00:05:46.019
Just as you have your family worship every week, so the better family does the same.

00:05:46.019 --> 00:05:51.180
We have the morning worship program.

00:05:51.180 --> 00:06:08.939
We also have the weekly watchtower study.

00:06:08.939 --> 00:06:13.139
Please help to keep the family spiritually strong.

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:24.310
They also help keep the family united.

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:36.250
Some Bethelites work in offices.

00:06:36.250 --> 00:07:33.050
Others work in supportive departments.

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:38.170
Regardless of what job we are assigned, why are we willing and happy to be doing this

00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:41.189
work?

00:07:41.189 --> 00:07:47.629
Because it is a sacred service, it helps to promote the fathering of kingdom interests

00:07:47.629 --> 00:07:51.069
and brings glory and honor to our God, Jehovah.
