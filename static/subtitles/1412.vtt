00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.810
Everything's big, with cream cheese and a large laddy, 850.

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.810
I think I forgot my pores.

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:16.810
Not my problem.

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.810
Come on, I'm yelled at time. I've been waiting forever.

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:20.810
And yet, still not my problem.

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.810
Are you serious? I can bring you the money after work.

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:26.810
Next customer.

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:27.810
Sorry, how much was her order?

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:28.810
850.

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:29.810
Oh, I've got it.

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.810
And could you add a regular coffee with cream?

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.810
Fine. 12 even.

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.709
Do I know you?

00:01:38.709 --> 00:01:39.709
No.

00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:40.709
I just want to help.

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:41.709
Thank you.

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:42.709
Of course.

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:44.709
How can I get you money to you?

00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:45.709
Yeah, don't worry about it.

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:47.709
Okay, thank you.

00:01:47.709 --> 00:02:07.340
But if you'd like a little something encouraging to read on your way to work, you might enjoy this.

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:14.009
I don't believe in God.

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:17.009
May I ask why?

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:36.789
I just don't.

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:40.460
Thanks again. You're very sweet.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:03:37.050
How many years in the camp?

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.050
11.

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:44.669
Will anyone else in your family be requesting resettlement?

00:03:44.669 --> 00:03:48.430
No.

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:49.430
Why?

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:55.530
They are all dead.

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:56.530
Killed.

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:01.789
I need a copy of your identity card.

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:25.610
It's all yours.

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:26.610
Country!
