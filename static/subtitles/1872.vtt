WEBVTT

00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:05.820
Before we begin our program this morning, we have an announcement.

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:10.060
We want all to hear, take note of.

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:18.179
We would like to remind you that no video streaming or recordings of any kind are permitted.

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:27.660
Any notes taken, whether hard copy or electronic, should not be forwarded to anyone else.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:34.850
So we know that you'll take note of that announcement.

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:43.380
Now that you're all seated, we'll ask you to stand.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:53.380
And sing song number 75, our reasons for joy, based on Matthew chapter 5, verse 12,

00:00:53.380 --> 00:03:14.979
that song number 75.

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:22.259
Our song gave us a question that it's impossible for us to answer at this stage.

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:27.780
And that is how deep are his thoughts.

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:36.819
Jehovah thinks deeply, and none of us have that ability to match the thinking of God.

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:42.139
Everything started with a thought from the Jehovah.

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:48.460
He thought about creating, and the first creation, as we all know, was the Logus.

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:55.379
And then after the Logus, we find myriads of angels being created by God.

00:03:55.379 --> 00:04:04.020
And of course, Jesus right alongside their with him, listening, watching, doing what God has him to do.

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:11.979
And then finally, there comes another thought, and that is mankind, to be placed on this earth.

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:14.819
But first of all, there has to be an earth.

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:21.019
So God brings about that creation, and that we have a beautiful earth here today.

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:25.339
It's going to be much prettier in the days ahead.

00:04:25.339 --> 00:04:31.060
And the crowning, of course, of the earth's creation is that of man himself.

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:37.579
We were created in the image of God, and we thanked Jehovah for that wonderful thought,

00:04:37.579 --> 00:04:41.899
that entered his mind, to create a beautiful planet,

00:04:41.899 --> 00:04:50.980
and then to put each one of us on it, along with billions of others.

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:58.420
So this is a wonderful day for us to start off thinking about the thoughts that originate with Jehovah.

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:07.420
This is graduation day for the 137th class of Gilead, and what a day is going to be.

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:11.540
Jehovah always thinks good thoughts, never bad thoughts.

00:05:11.579 --> 00:05:13.740
His thoughts are always good.

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:19.980
And we strive to think like God, but we just can't master such thinking.

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:22.980
Open your Bibles, please, to Isaiah.

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:28.740
And let's look at the 55th chapter, verses 8 and 9.

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:34.139
It says, for my thoughts are not your thoughts, and your ways are not my ways,

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:35.860
declared Jehovah.

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:41.699
For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so my ways are higher than your ways,

00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:45.139
and my thoughts than your thoughts.

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:53.139
So we strive to think like God, and He will help us to do just that.

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:58.339
But now to benefit from God's thinking, His thoughts, we need to love them.

00:05:58.339 --> 00:06:00.420
It's not just to hear them.

00:06:00.459 --> 00:06:06.300
It's not just to receive them, but it's to love the thinking of God.

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:12.379
And how can we love the thinking of God if we fail to meditate on the thoughts of God?

00:06:12.379 --> 00:06:20.180
So we have to let them sink down deep into our hearts, the wonderful thinking of God.

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:24.019
So we should feel about them just like the Psalmists did.

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:25.459
And how did the Psalmist feel?

00:06:25.459 --> 00:06:32.139
Well, let's turn to the Book of Psalms, the 139 Psalm, and look at verse 17.

00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:36.699
Now just the first part of verse 17.

00:06:36.699 --> 00:06:40.899
So to me, how precious your thoughts are.

00:06:40.899 --> 00:06:46.420
Oh God, how vast is the sum of them?

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:50.819
Is that the way you feel you gilly at this graduate soon?

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:56.819
That they're precious, these thoughts that originate with God.

00:06:56.819 --> 00:07:00.100
His thoughts are above ours.

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:03.939
There's no way that we can reach the thinking of God.

00:07:03.939 --> 00:07:08.740
But we strive desperately to do just that.

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:13.779
But before we start down any road, we need to ask ourselves this question.

00:07:13.779 --> 00:07:15.420
Where does the road lead me?

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:18.709
Where am I going?

00:07:18.709 --> 00:07:21.980
How will I end up?

00:07:22.019 --> 00:07:27.060
What's there at the end of the road?

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:28.779
Well, we need to ask God.

00:07:28.779 --> 00:07:30.980
We need to get God's thoughts on it.

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:32.740
We're starting down the road.

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:39.100
Now we need to find out from Jehovah just to where this road that I'm about to take is going to lead me.

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:49.620
For several months, you students sitting down here in front of me have been filling your minds with God's thoughts.

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:55.220
Now before you ever got here, you were filling your mind to a degree with God's thoughts.

00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:58.579
But it's increased hasn't it since you've been here.

00:07:58.579 --> 00:08:02.100
You've got a deeper appreciation of the thinking of God.

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:04.899
And you've found that through a study of the Bible.

00:08:04.899 --> 00:08:14.660
So that's why you're here so that you can follow the line of reason in thinking that originates in the mind of God.

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:22.019
Now like the rest of us, you've only scratched the surface of the mind of God.

00:08:22.019 --> 00:08:23.899
Just the surface.

00:08:23.899 --> 00:08:29.339
In fact, Job 26, 14 says, the fringes of his way.

00:08:29.339 --> 00:08:30.819
What does that mean?

00:08:30.819 --> 00:08:32.620
Well, you haven't gone very far.

00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:40.659
You're just on the border, just the edge of his ways, his thinking.

00:08:40.659 --> 00:08:43.779
Here's an example.

00:08:43.779 --> 00:08:52.100
You may be walking by a restaurant and you get a tantalizing smell that comes out of the restaurant.

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:56.259
Maybe it's a bread baking, wonderful smell, isn't it?

00:08:56.259 --> 00:09:00.539
But you want to do a little bit more than just smell the aroma.

00:09:00.539 --> 00:09:03.899
You want to taste the product.

00:09:03.899 --> 00:09:05.299
And that's what we want to do.

00:09:05.299 --> 00:09:08.179
But right now, we're just at the fringes.

00:09:08.179 --> 00:09:10.500
We've just scratched the surface.

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:14.259
We're just smelling.

00:09:14.259 --> 00:09:25.740
We're going to take some time to move inside the mind of God and really taste what it is all about.

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:33.500
We're going to have to leave here knowing a lot more than we did when we came.

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:34.740
And we will.

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:41.340
We can't attend the meeting without appreciating the Word of God just a little bit more than we did before.

00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:43.940
We walked through the door.

00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:47.570
But now you're going to graduate today.

00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:49.009
It's no doubt about that.

00:09:49.009 --> 00:09:53.450
But it will not be from high school in the college.

00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:59.629
It will be from preschool to kindergarten.

00:09:59.629 --> 00:10:02.330
That's all.

00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:08.490
You know another word for kindergarten, children, if all it means children.

00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:12.929
Usually from four to six years old, they tell us.

00:10:12.929 --> 00:10:15.490
That's kindergarten.

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:19.690
Well, we're all children in the eyes of God.

00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:21.970
So we invite you.

00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:24.129
Sit back with the rest of us.

00:10:24.129 --> 00:10:27.370
Relax and listen.

00:10:27.370 --> 00:10:37.940
Add a little more to what you already know from the bottomest pit called the mind of God.

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:43.179
To continue with our program this morning, we invite you to think about the following theme.

00:10:43.179 --> 00:10:46.820
The fruitage of the spirit is patience.

00:10:46.820 --> 00:11:11.789
This will be presented by brother John Larson, a United States branch committee member.

00:11:11.789 --> 00:11:16.429
It's the fourth listed aspect of the fruitage of the spirit and the only one that changed

00:11:16.429 --> 00:11:20.190
in English with the revision of the New World translation.

00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:23.269
And that quality is patience.

00:11:23.269 --> 00:11:28.230
But the thrust of this talk is the application of that quality in two areas.

00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:35.269
Number one, patience with Jehovah, number two, patience with ourselves.

00:11:35.269 --> 00:11:37.230
Now we talk about patience with Jehovah.

00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:39.909
That might sound a little sacrilegious.

00:11:39.909 --> 00:11:46.750
After all, Jehovah is very patient with us, but in what way are we patient with him?

00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:53.070
It's in the manner that's described for us here in the book of 1 Peter, chapter 5.

00:11:53.070 --> 00:12:00.259
1 Peter, chapter 5, and verse number 10.

00:12:00.259 --> 00:12:06.779
1 Peter 5, 10, it says, but after you have suffered a little while, the God of all undeserved

00:12:06.779 --> 00:12:12.100
kindness who called you to his everlasting glory and union with Christ will himself finish

00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:13.539
your training.

00:12:13.539 --> 00:12:15.259
He will make you firm.

00:12:15.259 --> 00:12:16.980
He will make you strong.

00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:19.419
He will firmly ground you.

00:12:19.419 --> 00:12:25.340
Now what a blessing we have to have the God of all undeserved kindness serve as our

00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:26.340
trainer.

00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:30.779
And likely you felt that way during these past five months in Gilead.

00:12:30.779 --> 00:12:36.379
But did you notice at the beginning of the verse, it also says after you have suffered

00:12:36.379 --> 00:12:41.620
a little while, maybe you felt a little of that during the past five months too.

00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:44.100
But the thought is, this is a process.

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:51.580
It involves suffering at times and it requires patience with our trainer, Jehovah.

00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:54.700
And how important is that quality?

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:59.220
So we'd like to just focus briefly on one individual who went through this training

00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:00.779
process.

00:13:00.779 --> 00:13:06.220
And we can read about him a little further back in the book of Hebrews, chapter 6, and

00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:09.759
verse 15.

00:13:09.759 --> 00:13:15.899
Hebrews, chapter 6, and verse 15.

00:13:15.899 --> 00:13:21.980
So after Abraham had shown patience, he obtained this promise.

00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:23.179
See how important it was?

00:13:23.299 --> 00:13:29.059
It meant the reward for him, obtaining the promise, the exercise of this quality.

00:13:29.059 --> 00:13:35.019
And we learn a lot about this quality of patience from Abraham in his life.

00:13:35.019 --> 00:13:41.220
For example, when Jehovah told Abraham that he was going to have a child by his wife,

00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:45.059
Sarah, the account says that Abraham laughed.

00:13:45.059 --> 00:13:51.620
And then it says he asked the question, will a man a hundred years old have a child born

00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:52.899
to him?

00:13:52.899 --> 00:13:57.899
And will Sarah, a woman ninety years old, give birth?

00:13:57.899 --> 00:14:02.700
Now the scriptures assure us that Abraham was not wavering in the lack of faith.

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:09.940
But he must have wondered, how in the world is this going to happen given our circumstances?

00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:14.899
A little later, Jehovah's angel approached Abraham and told him what Jehovah was going

00:14:14.899 --> 00:14:17.220
to do to Sodom and Gomorrah.

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:23.500
Now Abraham had a boatload of questions, including, will the judge of all the earth not do it

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:25.620
is right?

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:31.659
But Jehovah was training him, and Abraham was patiently learning from Jehovah.

00:14:31.659 --> 00:14:37.419
And then one day, when Jehovah came to him and said, take please your only son whom you

00:14:37.419 --> 00:14:45.039
so love and offer him up as a burn offering, no questions.

00:14:45.039 --> 00:14:52.840
Abraham as Romans chapter 4 verse 21 tells us, was fully convinced that what he had promised

00:14:52.840 --> 00:15:00.279
he was also able to do, including resurrecting his son Isaac from the dead if necessary.

00:15:00.279 --> 00:15:03.759
Abraham was learning from his trainer.

00:15:03.759 --> 00:15:08.559
Now you friends have gone through a five month training program with the God of all undeserved

00:15:08.559 --> 00:15:09.919
kindness.

00:15:09.919 --> 00:15:15.600
Some of you will be sent to a foreign assignment where you're going to have to adjust to a different

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:19.600
culture, different ways of doing things.

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:25.720
Others of you may return to your previous assignment, but with different responsibilities.

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:31.440
And definitely all of you with much higher expectations for yourself.

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:36.759
But remember, the fruitage of the Spirit is patience.

00:15:36.759 --> 00:15:42.399
The kind of patience that Abraham manifested while Jehovah, his trainer, was making him

00:15:42.399 --> 00:15:44.879
firm and strong.

00:15:44.879 --> 00:15:50.039
And that relates to our second point, which is patience with yourselves.

00:15:50.039 --> 00:15:57.120
Because Abraham, he faced conflict in his family, strains in his marriage.

00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:03.080
He had his own human weaknesses, all of this requiring patience with himself.

00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:08.200
Now maybe when you get to your assignment, the way that you're adjusting to a completely

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:14.159
new environment, new culture, new way of doing things, or if you return where you came

00:16:14.159 --> 00:16:18.879
from, maybe the way you're adapting with all these higher expectations for yourself is

00:16:18.879 --> 00:16:21.240
not what you hope for.

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:25.399
And you could, in effect, throw your hands in the air and say, with all this beautiful

00:16:25.399 --> 00:16:29.759
training that I had in Gilead, what's wrong with me?

00:16:29.759 --> 00:16:32.840
Or even what's wrong with our marriage?

00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:37.360
You know, my wife and I recently returned from a year and a half assignment in Mexico,

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:38.360
a year and a half.

00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:41.440
That's not a long time compared with many right here in this audience who have served

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:43.879
a whole lot longer in a foreign assignment.

00:16:43.879 --> 00:16:47.559
But it was our first time to experience such a thing.

00:16:47.559 --> 00:16:53.759
And it was a beautiful experience, but early on in the process, we were, after a week

00:16:53.759 --> 00:17:00.519
of adapting to new culture, a different way of doing things, completely different environment.

00:17:00.519 --> 00:17:05.599
And Friday evening, Tamara and I had a little blow-up between ourselves, one of the most

00:17:05.599 --> 00:17:08.079
difficult nights in our marriage.

00:17:08.079 --> 00:17:11.599
But you know, we learned two things from that experience.

00:17:11.599 --> 00:17:19.150
Number one, we came to find out that our reactions were more normal than we knew.

00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:21.910
And we might just illustrate it with a little house plant.

00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:26.849
What happens when you take a house plant up by the roots, you put it in a new pot with

00:17:26.849 --> 00:17:29.309
completely different soil?

00:17:29.309 --> 00:17:32.589
As you wonder if the thing is going to survive, don't you?

00:17:32.589 --> 00:17:37.750
But gradually, it starts to acclimate to the soil, it starts to grow in flourish.

00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:39.910
The same is true with you.

00:17:39.910 --> 00:17:44.910
To expect that we're going to take on a new assignment or even return to a previous

00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:51.390
assignment with all these higher expectations and hit the ground running, so to speak, it's

00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:53.470
just not realistic.

00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:57.029
And we are not immune to human feelings.

00:17:57.029 --> 00:18:03.230
So there's no need to throw our hands up in the air or lose patience with ourselves.

00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:09.109
Your reactions will probably be more normal than you know.

00:18:09.109 --> 00:18:14.509
The second thing that we learned from that experience is going back to Hebrews chapter

00:18:14.509 --> 00:18:16.509
6.

00:18:16.509 --> 00:18:22.269
You notice in verse 11, it mentions the word industriousness.

00:18:22.269 --> 00:18:29.390
And then verse 12, it says, so that you may not become sluggish, but be imitators of those

00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:34.710
who threw faith and patience in here at the promises.

00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:39.309
You know, the hardest thing that we could have done the next morning was go out and service,

00:18:39.309 --> 00:18:42.269
but it was the best thing that we could have done.

00:18:42.269 --> 00:18:47.869
And it taught us that Jehovah can continue to mold us and refine us if we don't get down

00:18:47.869 --> 00:18:53.349
on ourselves, but we keep doing what we know we're supposed to be doing.

00:18:53.349 --> 00:19:00.269
To expect perfection out of yourself is totally unrealistic and only leads to disappointment.

00:19:00.269 --> 00:19:03.950
The fruitage of the Spirit is patience.

00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:07.750
And this patience with Jehovah and with ourselves, what does it result in?

00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:13.190
Well, you may have noticed the first text that we read that last phrase in first Peter

00:19:13.269 --> 00:19:19.069
chapter 5 verse 10 was added with the revision of the New World translation, wasn't it?

00:19:19.069 --> 00:19:22.470
He will firmly ground you.

00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:26.549
It may remind you of the illustration of the little plant.

00:19:26.549 --> 00:19:32.710
Your roots will go deep, keeping you stable and balanced while your trainer makes you

00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:34.950
firm and strong.

00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:41.829
And meanwhile, as the God of all the undeserved kindness finishes your training, remember

00:19:41.829 --> 00:19:44.430
the fruitage of the Spirit is patience.

00:19:44.430 --> 00:20:02.369
I certainly want to thank you, brother Larson, for those fine thoughts.

00:20:02.369 --> 00:20:07.769
Get our graduation program off to a very fine start.

00:20:07.769 --> 00:20:12.089
Next on the program, we have brother Anthony Mars, who serves as a member of the governing

00:20:12.089 --> 00:20:13.769
body.

00:20:13.769 --> 00:20:19.170
And his theme is may your heart remain humble and live forever.

00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:28.819
I invite you to take your copy of the Bible, or you may be using a tablet.

00:20:28.819 --> 00:20:36.819
And turn to Psalm 22, this is where we find the scriptural thought for the theme of this

00:20:36.819 --> 00:20:46.079
particular talk on the program, Psalm 22.

00:20:46.079 --> 00:20:55.460
And you'll notice the beat part of verse 26, Psalm 22 and the beat part of verse 26.

00:20:56.900 --> 00:21:04.500
Those seeking Jehovah will praise him and notice, may you enjoy life forever.

00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:10.140
And then if you take it literally, soon to be graduates, notice the footnote, may your

00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:12.819
heart live forever.

00:21:12.819 --> 00:21:18.140
So we are emphasizing the figure of heart.

00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:24.900
Nonetheless, there are many hearts right here that the literal heart may beat forever.

00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:29.900
You might not have to experience it as there will be a great crowd survive the great

00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:35.700
tribulation, but primarily we're addressing the figure of heart.

00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:42.059
So if your figure of heart is going to live forever, then you have to be humble.

00:21:42.059 --> 00:21:46.660
And that means you're going to be advancing as a Christian.

00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:50.859
And if you're not humble, you can't advance.

00:21:50.859 --> 00:21:53.579
You lose your usefulness to Jehovah God.

00:21:53.579 --> 00:21:58.940
And that's happened to some fine individual brothers and sisters over the years I've

00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:01.299
seen with my own eyes.

00:22:01.299 --> 00:22:09.259
And it's quite interesting what Peter had to say and we know how often we go to his example,

00:22:09.259 --> 00:22:11.539
the voice of experience, if you will.

00:22:11.539 --> 00:22:16.059
And let's look at his second letter here, second Peter chapter one.

00:22:16.059 --> 00:22:22.539
And this has to do with, when you get to your assignments to continue to advance, it's

00:22:22.539 --> 00:22:27.740
a very serious and grave issue.

00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:37.329
Now second Peter chapter one and verse nine, Peter writes for anyone, so that covers everybody

00:22:37.329 --> 00:22:43.569
listening, lacking these things is blind, shutting his eyes to the light, and has become

00:22:43.569 --> 00:22:46.690
forgetful of his cleansing from his sins of long ago.

00:22:46.690 --> 00:22:55.009
And what comes to mind right away likely is what's these things that makes him blind

00:22:55.009 --> 00:22:58.490
if he's not adhering to him, lacking them.

00:22:58.490 --> 00:23:05.089
Well I call these the blueprints for life versus 5th or 8th of the same chapter.

00:23:05.089 --> 00:23:13.609
They're listed nicely, faith virtue, knowledge, self-control, endurance, godly devotion,

00:23:13.609 --> 00:23:16.690
brotherly affection and love.

00:23:16.690 --> 00:23:20.970
So this is a deliberate blindness on our part.

00:23:20.970 --> 00:23:25.609
This is where you make the choice to no longer advance as a Christian.

00:23:25.609 --> 00:23:30.210
And the Watchtower decades ago was very straightforward on this matter.

00:23:30.210 --> 00:23:39.410
And I'm going to read it right from the May 1st, 1980 Watchtower page 24, very frank.

00:23:39.410 --> 00:23:45.369
The individual who fails to make spiritual progress, whose profession of faith lacks

00:23:45.369 --> 00:23:50.369
the footage of a Christlike personality is spiritually blind.

00:23:50.369 --> 00:23:53.250
Pretty straightforward, don't you agree?

00:23:53.250 --> 00:23:55.769
Now notice it gets stronger.

00:23:55.769 --> 00:23:59.170
He does not see what it means to be a Christian.

00:23:59.170 --> 00:24:06.450
This blindness is deliberate for his acceptance of the good news required that he continue

00:24:06.450 --> 00:24:09.730
to work in becoming more like his master.

00:24:09.730 --> 00:24:11.450
Whoa.

00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:19.369
That's so rare isn't anyone listening that that doesn't hit right between the eyes.

00:24:19.369 --> 00:24:24.529
It's very humbling to try to be like Christ Jesus.

00:24:24.529 --> 00:24:31.569
And yet it's a good thing, I was really proud of Brother Lars and my to confess to this

00:24:31.569 --> 00:24:32.890
huge audience.

00:24:32.890 --> 00:24:36.950
Don't you love them?

00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:44.269
And I'm not doing any confessing so, so don't worry.

00:24:44.269 --> 00:24:53.150
Maybe I'll interview Brother Jackson and let him confess a little bit.

00:24:53.150 --> 00:24:59.750
But the honesty there to advance, and that's what James talked about, confessing her sins

00:24:59.750 --> 00:25:06.390
to one another, while a proud man could never do what John just did.

00:25:06.390 --> 00:25:09.990
Because the sin of pride is something we want to caution you about, not that I've seen

00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:14.430
this in the class, I'm not saying that, but the sin of pride leads to arrogance.

00:25:14.430 --> 00:25:21.269
So we're going to give you an extreme example and scripture of what it can end up like.

00:25:21.269 --> 00:25:26.309
You can see pride, it's just like rose bush, it looks beautiful.

00:25:26.309 --> 00:25:31.269
But if a worm gets in there and starts getting to the root of the rose bush, it will bloom

00:25:31.269 --> 00:25:35.390
for a while, looks nice as soon as it's dead.

00:25:35.390 --> 00:25:37.390
That's what pride does.

00:25:37.390 --> 00:25:44.509
And turn to Acts chapter 12 when you see, this is an extreme example.

00:25:44.509 --> 00:25:50.829
Even though we've had some presumptuous people in this organization years past that kind

00:25:50.829 --> 00:26:03.309
of remind me of this individual, Acts chapter 12, and verse 21 through 23.

00:26:03.309 --> 00:26:05.630
Acts 12, 21.

00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:12.009
On a set day, Hared clothed himself with royal raiment and sat down on the judgment seat

00:26:12.009 --> 00:26:14.910
and began giving them a public address.

00:26:14.910 --> 00:26:20.190
Now Josephus reveals, and this was in the imitate of faith publication, that it was made

00:26:20.190 --> 00:26:27.710
out of silver, this is a garment, so that when the sun hit him, he just glistened.

00:26:27.710 --> 00:26:33.589
So not only was his speech going on, but he looked like a star.

00:26:33.589 --> 00:26:43.589
And so 22, then the people who were assembled began shouting, a God's voice and not a man's.

00:26:43.589 --> 00:26:45.069
How do you think he felt at that moment?

00:26:45.069 --> 00:26:46.069
Yeah, yeah.

00:26:46.069 --> 00:26:47.069
Got that right.

00:26:47.069 --> 00:26:51.789
Because there are a lot of men that really think of themselves as God's.

00:26:51.789 --> 00:26:56.470
Well, how did Jehovah react?

00:26:56.470 --> 00:27:03.230
Verse 23, instantly, the angel of Jehovah struck him, and here's why, lesson, because

00:27:03.230 --> 00:27:06.750
he did not give the glory to God.

00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:12.420
And he was eaten up with worms and died.

00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:20.019
This egomaniac suffered this gruesome death because of the sin of pride, and in his case

00:27:20.019 --> 00:27:25.500
it elevated all the way to arrogance.

00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:29.700
This is an absolute egomaniac.

00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:34.940
Now let's contrast him with Peter, and we're going to serve this picture.

00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:41.099
Look at the screen, the others are listening in, and we'll be able to not have to worry

00:27:41.099 --> 00:27:42.099
about that.

00:27:42.099 --> 00:27:47.019
So look at the picture here, and this is an imitate of faith publication.

00:27:47.099 --> 00:27:51.900
This is that experience, and it's so sobering.

00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:55.500
Now Peter loved Jesus.

00:27:55.500 --> 00:28:00.299
Jesus loved Peter, but he also loved him enough to rebuke him when necessary.

00:28:00.299 --> 00:28:07.299
So this is the occasion when he points at him, and he looked at his disciples, and he says,

00:28:07.299 --> 00:28:11.660
don't get behind me Satan, because you don't think God's thoughts.

00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:14.420
You think those of men.

00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:17.299
So he let him have it right between the eyes.

00:28:17.299 --> 00:28:25.019
Now good question, how did Peter react from this rebuke?

00:28:25.019 --> 00:28:28.319
Did he get angry?

00:28:28.319 --> 00:28:29.319
Did he?

00:28:29.319 --> 00:28:30.319
Sulk?

00:28:30.319 --> 00:28:36.440
No, he took it like a spiritual man, and he corrected himself.

00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:43.839
So keep this thought in mind, it was in the imitate, the faith book, and this goes for

00:28:43.839 --> 00:28:45.680
all of us.

00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:52.799
All those who follow Christ will need correction at times, only if we humbly accept discipline

00:28:52.799 --> 00:28:58.599
and learn from it, can we continue to grow closer to Jesus Christ and his Father, Jehovah

00:28:58.599 --> 00:28:59.599
God?

00:28:59.599 --> 00:29:06.960
See, because human thinking can sometimes take priority over godly thinking, you might

00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:12.000
even sincerely feel like you're trying to help, but you can become a proponent of Satan's

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:15.200
purpose if you're not careful.

00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:21.279
See, good warning, avoid it like the plague.

00:29:21.279 --> 00:29:34.509
Now note Peter's counsel here in 1 Peter chapter 5, 1 Peter chapter 5, and we want you

00:29:34.509 --> 00:29:41.630
to take this inspired thought with you to your assignments, and it's good reminder for

00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:47.509
all of us, 1 Peter chapter 5 verse 5.

00:29:47.509 --> 00:29:54.869
In the same way, you younger men be in subjection to the older men, notice, but all of you

00:29:54.869 --> 00:29:59.950
clothe yourselves with humility toward one another, and he gives the reason because God

00:29:59.950 --> 00:30:05.549
opposes the haughty ones, but he gives undeserved kindness to the humble ones.

00:30:05.549 --> 00:30:08.509
The humble hearts will live forever.

00:30:08.509 --> 00:30:14.029
See, that's why we can treat you to remain humble and your hearts will live forever.

00:30:14.029 --> 00:30:20.309
So you actually, every day, every waking moment, as soon as you get up in the morning,

00:30:20.309 --> 00:30:25.829
clothe yourself with humility, get ready for the day, put it on, and you're going to have

00:30:25.829 --> 00:30:31.269
a better day because you're clothe with humility.

00:30:31.269 --> 00:30:36.109
A lot of things can happen wherever you are serving, but if you're clothe with humility,

00:30:36.109 --> 00:30:38.390
it's going to make it easier to bear.

00:30:38.589 --> 00:30:47.869
So, something else that some don't seem to get clear in their minds, would you really

00:30:47.869 --> 00:30:50.390
want God opposing you?

00:30:50.390 --> 00:30:54.470
Well, if you lack humility, guess what?

00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:58.789
And I've noticed this, frankly, you're just for Bethel's service, and I love the privilege

00:30:58.789 --> 00:31:01.430
to serve with Bethel.

00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:04.670
If you don't have humility, you can't stay here.

00:31:04.670 --> 00:31:07.029
You're going to be miserable.

00:31:07.029 --> 00:31:14.890
You've got to overseer's everywhere, everywhere, okay, where you're going, you know?

00:31:14.890 --> 00:31:20.730
So, but the humble love it, and I look at him, if you're not happy at Bethel, I mean other

00:31:20.730 --> 00:31:26.890
than you're having an off day, that's human, probably you've got a humility problem.

00:31:26.890 --> 00:31:35.130
Most of the time, the humble love sacred service, and can put up with just about anything.

00:31:35.130 --> 00:31:36.130
See?

00:31:36.369 --> 00:31:41.569
Don't be like this elder many decades ago, not a long time ago.

00:31:41.569 --> 00:31:48.769
So, the circuit officer and the elders on the body have concluded amongst other things,

00:31:48.769 --> 00:31:54.410
but a major factor of disqualifying him is he's not humble.

00:31:54.410 --> 00:32:00.569
So, he's appealing and he writes in, so it gets to the service department.

00:32:00.569 --> 00:32:06.009
Dear brothers, they've removed me, and I want to appeal, because one of the things

00:32:06.049 --> 00:32:09.890
they've said is that I lack humility.

00:32:09.890 --> 00:32:20.880
And brothers, I am the humblest man I know, who's in his letter, you can't make this stuff

00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:21.880
up.

00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:27.359
So, not a good thing.

00:32:27.359 --> 00:32:31.799
He was deleted.

00:32:31.799 --> 00:32:39.240
How much better to go by that beautiful wise Scottish proverb?

00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:47.799
Some power the gift would give us to see ourselves as others see us, from many a blunder,

00:32:47.799 --> 00:32:50.000
it would free us.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:54.759
Think about it, avoid a lot of blunders.

00:32:54.759 --> 00:32:58.960
And I have learned things from people that didn't like me.

00:32:58.960 --> 00:32:59.960
Can you believe it?

00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:05.759
But I thought, well, let me look at it.

00:33:05.759 --> 00:33:10.920
So you grow spiritually, so I'll be careful, especially some of you getting an added

00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:18.559
amount of responsibility in your assignment, and just word of caution, my experience, and

00:33:18.559 --> 00:33:22.079
I think my fellow members of the governing body would agree.

00:33:22.079 --> 00:33:26.640
I'll find out if they don't later.

00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:31.079
The more responsibility I've received in the earthly part of God's organization over

00:33:31.079 --> 00:33:36.480
the years, the less authority I realize I have.

00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:40.160
And you don't get more responsibility than being a member of the governing body.

00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:48.319
But I, in the rest of us, feel the same way because we know who the real authority is.

00:33:48.319 --> 00:33:53.359
Christ Jesus is in charge on Wednesdays in our committee meeting days.

00:33:53.359 --> 00:33:54.359
Really?

00:33:54.359 --> 00:33:56.559
Jehovah's in charge.

00:33:56.559 --> 00:33:58.160
So keep that in mind.

00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:00.400
You get more responsibility.

00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:05.000
Remember the authority lies in Christ Jesus and Jehovah God.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:11.199
When you get direction from the faithful and discrete slave, just say, God, help me to

00:34:11.199 --> 00:34:15.000
do and implement this decision, say.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:21.400
And we just entreat you, may your hearts remain humble, and may you enjoy life forever.

00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:43.739
We say we want to thank you by the morse for that most humbling talk.

00:34:43.739 --> 00:34:49.900
For the next few minutes, we encourage you, Gilead students, to ponder on the next theme.

00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:56.820
He does not give the spirit sparingly, which will be presented by one of your instructors,

00:34:56.820 --> 00:35:00.539
Brother Michael Burnett.

00:35:00.539 --> 00:35:06.539
In my hand here, I have your photo album, and in reading it, looking it over, the last

00:35:06.539 --> 00:35:12.900
page was something I felt was significant, especially in connection with this talk.

00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:15.739
This is what you said in conclusion.

00:35:15.739 --> 00:35:19.500
You said we spent five beautiful months together.

00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:23.460
We become close friends, and we can agree with that.

00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:26.420
We've learned how to serve Jehovah in a better way.

00:35:26.420 --> 00:35:33.019
So when we have some difficulties or doubts, ask yourself this.

00:35:33.019 --> 00:35:34.619
Is it easy?

00:35:34.619 --> 00:35:35.699
No.

00:35:35.699 --> 00:35:37.340
Is it possible?

00:35:37.340 --> 00:35:40.539
You say yes.

00:35:40.539 --> 00:35:41.860
Because and how?

00:35:41.860 --> 00:35:43.900
Because of Holy Spirit.

00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:48.780
And that really fits in nicely with this talk, because you are a product of Holy Spirit

00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:49.780
as it were.

00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:53.820
Your success is based on Jehovah's Holy Spirit.

00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:59.659
Now when you think about when you first came to Gilead, and you met the student body,

00:35:59.659 --> 00:36:05.420
and you started thinking and talking about yourselves and things that maybe you have experienced,

00:36:05.420 --> 00:36:09.900
or they have experienced, then probably you begin to think, who am I?

00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:12.739
Why am I even here?

00:36:12.739 --> 00:36:18.139
But in addition to that, when you saw the curriculum, you probably went, oh my!

00:36:18.139 --> 00:36:21.340
The reports, how am I going to do this?

00:36:21.340 --> 00:36:27.500
Then the instructors came in, and we put you at peace.

00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:32.739
But you know, there may be added responsibilities that have already been alluded to, and we

00:36:32.739 --> 00:36:38.380
wanted to consider an example of a man who took on added responsibility and how he was

00:36:38.380 --> 00:36:40.179
able to cope with it.

00:36:40.179 --> 00:36:41.739
His name is Bezilell.

00:36:41.739 --> 00:36:52.239
So if you open your Bibles to Exodus, Exodus 35, we're going to consider what experience

00:36:52.239 --> 00:36:59.800
that he had, what responsibility that he took on, and how he was appointed to oversee

00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:02.239
the construction of the Tabernacle.

00:37:02.239 --> 00:37:10.300
This is Exodus 35, and we're starting with verse 30.

00:37:10.300 --> 00:37:17.000
Then Moses said to the Israelites, see Jehovah has chosen Bezilell, the son of your

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:24.280
eye, the son of her of the tribe of Judah, he has filled him with the Spirit of God.

00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:31.320
Now notice what that Spirit would enable him to do, giving him wisdom, understanding,

00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:38.239
knowledge of every sort of craftsmanship, for making artistic designs, for working with

00:37:38.239 --> 00:37:45.519
gold, silver, and copper, for cutting, setting stones, and for making all kinds of artistic

00:37:45.519 --> 00:37:53.159
wood products, revised Bibles says to make ingenious products of every sort.

00:37:53.159 --> 00:37:58.400
And he's put into his heart to teach, he and a whole lab, the son of a hisomac, of the

00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:00.239
tribe of Dan.

00:38:00.239 --> 00:38:05.840
He's filled them with skill to do all the work of a craftsman, an embroiderer, and a weaver

00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:13.119
using blue thread, purple wool, scarlet material, fine linen, of a loom worker.

00:38:13.119 --> 00:38:18.119
These men will do every sort of work and prepare every sort of design.

00:38:18.119 --> 00:38:21.280
So this is the official appointment to build the tabernacle.

00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:27.400
Now can you imagine how immense that project would be, and yet he accepted it, because

00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:31.239
Jehovah says, I'm going to give you my Spirit.

00:38:31.239 --> 00:38:33.960
Did he have any ability in this before?

00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:34.960
We don't know.

00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:39.480
He may have learned a trade in Egypt, but we do know this, and that is if you turn back

00:38:39.480 --> 00:39:00.199
to Exodus chapter 1, Exodus 1, we're looking at verse 13 regarding his employment.

00:39:00.199 --> 00:39:05.000
Consequently, the Egyptians forced the Israelites into harsh slavery.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:13.159
They made their life bitter with hard labor as they worked with clay, mortar, and bricks.

00:39:13.159 --> 00:39:15.719
So he was a brick maker.

00:39:15.719 --> 00:39:17.679
We do know that.

00:39:17.679 --> 00:39:27.599
And yet when you go back to Exodus 35, it's in verse 31 that Jehovah says, I will give

00:39:27.599 --> 00:39:33.239
you the wisdom, the ability that you need, even if you're not an artisan as it were,

00:39:33.239 --> 00:39:35.519
or a craftsman.

00:39:35.519 --> 00:39:41.880
Verse 31 says, he filled him with the Spirit of God giving him wisdom, understanding, and

00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:45.559
knowledge of every sort of craftsmanship.

00:39:45.559 --> 00:39:49.320
And his work was beautiful and long-lasting.

00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:53.440
For 500 years it existed, or a little under 500 years.

00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:56.639
But now look at verse 34.

00:39:56.639 --> 00:40:05.480
In addition to him being a craftsman, Jehovah in verse 34 put it into his heart to teach.

00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:08.440
And that's what we have tried to do too here at Gilead.

00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:11.679
We've tried to put it in your heart to teach.

00:40:11.679 --> 00:40:16.880
Not just run through the scriptures, one after the other, but take a set of scriptures,

00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:23.119
analyze them for brevity, clarity, and principled application.

00:40:23.119 --> 00:40:26.360
And that's what we want you to do when you go back to the field.

00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:28.840
This is the way that we want you to teach.

00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:32.119
And if you will, then you'll fulfill your commission.

00:40:32.119 --> 00:40:38.000
And that is to stabilize and strengthen the field and branch organization.

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:43.199
Your effects will be long-lasting and appreciated.

00:40:43.199 --> 00:40:49.039
But when you take on new responsibilities, you may feel overwhelmed, maybe Bezel did.

00:40:49.039 --> 00:40:51.400
You may say, well, I'm just a bricklayer.

00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:53.519
That's all I am.

00:40:53.519 --> 00:40:57.920
But we want to take you back to theocratic organization.

00:40:57.920 --> 00:41:02.480
Remember in theocratic organization, we talked about a man named RJ Martin.

00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:06.840
He was the factory overseer down in Brooklyn in the 20s.

00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:11.679
And this is what he says about a responsibility that he was given.

00:41:11.679 --> 00:41:18.719
He says this, a big rotary press came into our hands, came into the hands that knew nothing

00:41:18.719 --> 00:41:21.800
about its construction and operation.

00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:23.360
And that may be true of you in the future.

00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:28.000
You may be given a responsibility that you know nothing about.

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:32.199
But the Lord knows how to quicken the minds of those who have committed their all to him.

00:41:32.199 --> 00:41:34.000
You see, that's the point.

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:37.519
They've committed their all to him.

00:41:37.519 --> 00:41:41.159
In a very few weeks, we were able to make the press hum.

00:41:41.159 --> 00:41:45.840
It's still humming, doing the work that even its makers never knew it could do.

00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:50.400
Jehovah's continued to bless such efforts to this very day.

00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:56.320
So just remember, it was Jehovah's spirit who in heightened, which in heightened Bezel's

00:41:56.320 --> 00:42:01.320
ability, his natural ability was heightened by Holy Spirit.

00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:04.280
He elevated his natural ability.

00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:07.519
And Jehovah will do the very same thing for you brothers.

00:42:07.519 --> 00:42:09.199
Now what about you sisters?

00:42:09.199 --> 00:42:11.519
Is there anything here for you?

00:42:11.519 --> 00:42:20.619
Well, let's go back to Exodus 35.

00:42:20.619 --> 00:42:26.119
We're going to focus in on verse 25, okay?

00:42:26.119 --> 00:42:32.000
All the skilled women, and you're skilled, spun with their hands, and they brought what

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:38.719
they had spun, blew thread, purple wool, scarlet material, and fine linen.

00:42:38.719 --> 00:42:46.440
And again, it says in verse 26, and all the skilled women whose hearts impelled them, spun

00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:49.159
the goat hair.

00:42:49.159 --> 00:42:54.400
Now if you go back to verse 35, this all fits.

00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:58.039
You see, they supported the work that O'Holiab taught.

00:42:58.039 --> 00:43:05.119
And Bezel El, 35, he's filled them, that's Bezel El and O'Holiab, with skilled to do all

00:43:05.119 --> 00:43:08.800
the work of a craftsman, and then all this embroidering.

00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:14.159
So these skilled women supported the building project.

00:43:14.159 --> 00:43:16.559
And that's exactly what you've done.

00:43:16.559 --> 00:43:20.519
All of you, gillied sisters, are skilled women.

00:43:20.519 --> 00:43:22.039
And here's the point.

00:43:22.039 --> 00:43:26.239
If you didn't support your husbands, your husbands would not be here.

00:43:26.239 --> 00:43:33.119
The reason your husbands are going through gillied is because of you, your skilled women.

00:43:33.119 --> 00:43:37.849
I think this quote here from the watchtower puts it nicely.

00:43:37.849 --> 00:43:42.849
Jehovah gives his servants enough of his spirit to do the work that they're given to do.

00:43:42.849 --> 00:43:47.969
He does not give them an inadequate measure of his spirit so that they're hampered in

00:43:47.969 --> 00:43:50.809
the work that he's assigned to them.

00:43:50.809 --> 00:43:58.489
Based on John 3 and verse 34, Jehovah does not give the spirit sparingly.

00:43:58.489 --> 00:44:00.409
He gives you what you need.

00:44:00.409 --> 00:44:02.210
So what's the point?

00:44:02.210 --> 00:44:06.360
Take note of this, okay?

00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:08.559
This is important.

00:44:08.559 --> 00:44:11.440
You may see this again.

00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:13.000
Here's the point.

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:18.519
Tempor your natural abilities with humility and an obedient spirit.

00:44:18.519 --> 00:44:22.150
I'll repeat that.

00:44:22.150 --> 00:44:27.750
Tempor your natural abilities with humility and an obedient spirit.

00:44:27.750 --> 00:44:30.989
And if you do, Jehovah will give you his spirit fully.

00:44:30.989 --> 00:44:48.860
Thank you, brother Burnett, we'd certainly be lost without God's spirit.

00:44:48.860 --> 00:44:52.460
We all need it, appreciate it.

00:44:52.460 --> 00:44:57.260
For the next theme on our program, we have a question for you.

00:44:57.260 --> 00:45:00.019
Will you dance with me?

00:45:00.019 --> 00:45:02.940
No, not with me.

00:45:02.940 --> 00:45:06.780
Let's see what this means as another of the instructors from the Theacradi Schools

00:45:06.780 --> 00:45:07.780
Department.

00:45:07.780 --> 00:45:14.420
Brother Mark Numer explains this intriguing question.

00:45:14.420 --> 00:45:20.019
He was about 37 years old, a monarch, a celebrated soldier, a fearless

00:45:20.019 --> 00:45:22.179
commander of mighty men.

00:45:22.179 --> 00:45:29.460
But on this occasion, he chooses no royal garments, no crown, no grand entrance, nor does

00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:35.340
he care if his expression of zeal for true worship causes others to lose respect for

00:45:35.340 --> 00:45:36.340
him.

00:45:36.340 --> 00:45:41.780
And we're referring to the time period when King David brought the Ark of the Covenant

00:45:41.780 --> 00:45:43.420
to Jerusalem.

00:45:43.420 --> 00:45:48.579
Now I know we discussed this briefly in class, but we didn't finish.

00:45:48.579 --> 00:45:49.860
And now we will.

00:45:49.860 --> 00:45:50.860
Why?

00:45:50.860 --> 00:45:56.500
Because this inspired account has lessons that you need to learn and take to your assignments.

00:45:56.500 --> 00:46:02.820
So let's open our Bibles now to 2nd Samuel, chapter 6, and we'll begin by reading verse

00:46:02.820 --> 00:46:12.909
14, 2nd Samuel, chapter 6, and verse 14.

00:46:12.909 --> 00:46:17.230
David was dancing around before Jehovah with all his might.

00:46:17.230 --> 00:46:24.389
All the while David wore a linen effort, a linen robe.

00:46:24.389 --> 00:46:31.349
David took off his imperial garb, put on this plain linen garment, an ordinary man among

00:46:31.349 --> 00:46:33.469
ordinary people.

00:46:33.469 --> 00:46:39.710
Verse 15 shows it was joyful, shouting, and sounds of the horn imagine the smiles on the

00:46:39.710 --> 00:46:45.070
faces of people as they watch their king dance with them and come down to earth to their

00:46:45.070 --> 00:46:47.389
level.

00:46:47.389 --> 00:46:52.389
Verse 20, now Michael, his wife, comes into the picture.

00:46:52.389 --> 00:47:01.110
She ridicules David's humility and says to him, now, and you danced with the slave girls

00:47:01.110 --> 00:47:11.750
of your servants, you danced with these lowly people, how embarrassing, how humiliating,

00:47:11.750 --> 00:47:16.309
David, what were you thinking?

00:47:16.309 --> 00:47:20.230
And maybe David was thinking this.

00:47:20.230 --> 00:47:29.789
I will honor these servants of mine the same way that Jehovah honors me, and perhaps he

00:47:29.789 --> 00:47:36.670
reflected when Jehovah honored him as a little boy, a shepherd boy, a nobody.

00:47:36.670 --> 00:47:42.989
And then he said to himself, how pleased Jehovah would be if I, the king, honor these

00:47:42.989 --> 00:47:48.590
hard working servants, these slave girls, they work so hard.

00:47:48.590 --> 00:47:54.789
What effect do you think it had on these slave girls, a humility of David on these slave

00:47:54.789 --> 00:47:55.789
girls?

00:47:55.789 --> 00:47:56.789
What effect do you think it had?

00:47:56.789 --> 00:47:59.150
Would they ever forget that day?

00:47:59.150 --> 00:48:00.989
They will talk about that day.

00:48:00.989 --> 00:48:04.829
They will tell their children, they will tell their grandchildren, do you know, I danced

00:48:04.829 --> 00:48:10.309
with the king, and the children would say, no, mother, you didn't dance with the king.

00:48:10.309 --> 00:48:14.429
That's King David, I'm telling you, the king danced with me.

00:48:14.429 --> 00:48:15.429
No.

00:48:15.429 --> 00:48:16.429
Well, what did he wear?

00:48:16.429 --> 00:48:20.989
He took off his imperial garb and he put on that linen robe and he came down to earth

00:48:20.989 --> 00:48:22.670
and he danced with us.

00:48:22.670 --> 00:48:25.030
I will never forget that day.

00:48:25.030 --> 00:48:29.949
The king danced with me.

00:48:29.949 --> 00:48:31.349
Application to you.

00:48:31.349 --> 00:48:34.789
Will you dance with the slave girls?

00:48:34.789 --> 00:48:40.510
That's the question and your attitude and how you treat others will cry resounding

00:48:40.510 --> 00:48:45.070
yes or no to that very question.

00:48:45.070 --> 00:48:54.829
For example, will you be known as one who was helpful to those with little or no responsibility?

00:48:54.829 --> 00:49:00.829
Will you choose your friends based solely on their positions in the organization or will

00:49:00.829 --> 00:49:06.989
you value others because of their spiritual qualities?

00:49:06.989 --> 00:49:12.469
If you discern that you can make someone's life easier and make their work more effective,

00:49:12.469 --> 00:49:14.469
what will you do?

00:49:14.469 --> 00:49:17.989
Will you say, wasn't easy for me?

00:49:17.989 --> 00:49:22.269
I didn't have it easy in the past, why should you have it easy?

00:49:22.269 --> 00:49:28.190
You know, I had it tough in the past, I did without, now it's your turn.

00:49:28.190 --> 00:49:29.750
Will you do that?

00:49:29.750 --> 00:49:34.989
Will you rise above such fleshly thinking and be helpful?

00:49:34.989 --> 00:49:39.389
If you're at Bethel, will you take an interest in those in the field?

00:49:39.389 --> 00:49:44.389
For instance, will you, if you know someone who has had a difficult week, a difficult

00:49:44.389 --> 00:49:49.510
month in the field, will you make contact with them, give them a word of encouragement?

00:49:49.510 --> 00:49:54.550
In other words, will you be so absorbed in your work and your own problems that you

00:49:54.550 --> 00:49:58.429
fail to notice the little sheep saying to you?

00:49:58.429 --> 00:50:01.949
Will you dance with me?

00:50:01.949 --> 00:50:07.349
And imagine the positive effect you can have on others, a field worker saying, the office

00:50:07.349 --> 00:50:08.869
called me.

00:50:08.869 --> 00:50:09.869
They did?

00:50:09.869 --> 00:50:10.869
Yes.

00:50:10.869 --> 00:50:14.150
To give encouragement, they wanted to check on me.

00:50:14.150 --> 00:50:18.869
Imagine the Bethelite saying, my overseer visited me, they did.

00:50:18.869 --> 00:50:19.869
He did?

00:50:19.869 --> 00:50:20.869
Why?

00:50:20.869 --> 00:50:23.789
Well, not to counsel me, but to shepherd me.

00:50:23.789 --> 00:50:25.750
They actually read a scripture with me.

00:50:25.750 --> 00:50:27.389
They gave some encouraging words.

00:50:27.389 --> 00:50:29.389
They wanted to know how I was doing.

00:50:29.389 --> 00:50:33.869
He acknowledged my difficult situation and asked if there was anything he could do to

00:50:33.869 --> 00:50:34.869
help.

00:50:34.869 --> 00:50:38.630
He acknowledged that and said, thank you for your endurance and your hard work under

00:50:38.630 --> 00:50:41.150
these circumstances.

00:50:41.150 --> 00:50:45.789
He sought me out in the dining room and said, will you eat lunch with me?

00:50:45.789 --> 00:50:54.630
These are some of the ways you say, yes, one asked, will you dance with me?

00:50:54.630 --> 00:50:58.309
Now as a sister, how are you involved?

00:50:58.309 --> 00:51:04.070
How will you treat those dancing with the slave girls?

00:51:04.070 --> 00:51:08.030
Now Michael, she ridiculed David Zeal.

00:51:08.030 --> 00:51:10.190
She ridiculed his humility.

00:51:10.190 --> 00:51:13.789
She felt his actions were inappropriate and undignified.

00:51:13.789 --> 00:51:22.429
You learn a vital lesson there when your husband performs menial tasks or works hard so

00:51:22.429 --> 00:51:26.989
as not to show himself superior to others.

00:51:26.989 --> 00:51:27.989
Thank Jehovah.

00:51:27.989 --> 00:51:30.510
You have a spiritual husband.

00:51:30.510 --> 00:51:31.510
Thank Jehovah.

00:51:31.510 --> 00:51:35.309
You have a husband that wants to imitate Jehovah God.

00:51:35.309 --> 00:51:37.750
And when you do, you encourage him.

00:51:37.750 --> 00:51:39.150
You help him.

00:51:39.150 --> 00:51:42.909
You show a similar attitude of humility, too.

00:51:42.909 --> 00:51:46.230
And in this way, do you know what you do?

00:51:46.230 --> 00:51:47.989
You become a dancer.

00:51:47.989 --> 00:51:54.300
And you dance as a lowly slave girl.

00:51:54.300 --> 00:51:58.539
What else can we learn from David's example?

00:51:58.539 --> 00:52:01.659
Let's read verse 22.

00:52:01.659 --> 00:52:10.260
Same chapter, second Samuel 6, this time, verse 22, speaking to Michael, he says, now.

00:52:10.260 --> 00:52:13.059
And you think that was something?

00:52:13.059 --> 00:52:17.139
I will humble myself even more than this.

00:52:17.139 --> 00:52:21.059
And become low even in my own eyes.

00:52:21.059 --> 00:52:23.460
The slave girls, yes, that was one thing.

00:52:23.460 --> 00:52:29.579
But I'm going to continue to become low in my own eyes.

00:52:29.579 --> 00:52:34.059
You see, David was not just willing to be humble on this one occasion.

00:52:34.059 --> 00:52:36.699
He wanted to maintain that humility.

00:52:36.699 --> 00:52:41.300
It wasn't as if David said, you know, now I dance with the slave girls.

00:52:41.300 --> 00:52:42.300
It was a great show.

00:52:42.300 --> 00:52:43.739
I showed my humility.

00:52:43.739 --> 00:52:44.579
Everybody saw me.

00:52:44.579 --> 00:52:45.900
It's public.

00:52:45.900 --> 00:52:47.099
That was great.

00:52:47.099 --> 00:52:51.780
Now it's time for me to put on my royal garments, get my crown, show people who's in charge

00:52:51.780 --> 00:52:52.780
around here.

00:52:52.780 --> 00:52:54.699
I'm boss.

00:52:54.699 --> 00:52:57.500
But I put on a great show.

00:52:57.500 --> 00:52:59.500
No, no.

00:52:59.500 --> 00:53:05.099
David was determined to continue to show this type of humility.

00:53:05.099 --> 00:53:06.500
And he did just that.

00:53:06.500 --> 00:53:10.739
He kept on serving Jehovah with humility.

00:53:10.739 --> 00:53:20.500
So, years later, David humbled himself by showing loyal love to Mfibesheth.

00:53:20.500 --> 00:53:24.300
Now loyal love is that love that is unique.

00:53:24.300 --> 00:53:28.659
It's the love that descends from top to bottom.

00:53:28.659 --> 00:53:33.619
We think about loyalty, we think about the attitude of one lower in rank toward a superior,

00:53:33.619 --> 00:53:38.139
but not with the biblical expression of loyal love.

00:53:38.139 --> 00:53:40.019
It is just the opposite.

00:53:40.019 --> 00:53:44.139
It's the powerful being loyal to the weak, the needy, and the dependent.

00:53:44.139 --> 00:53:49.460
David understood this and was not embarrassed to have this crippled Mfibesheth eat at his

00:53:49.460 --> 00:53:55.699
table with handsome, absalom and beautiful Tamar and muscular Joab.

00:53:55.699 --> 00:54:04.300
No wonder Jehovah God loved David and called him a man agreeable to my heart.

00:54:04.300 --> 00:54:05.300
Why?

00:54:05.300 --> 00:54:09.099
Because David was imitating Jehovah.

00:54:09.099 --> 00:54:10.780
Why do we say that?

00:54:10.780 --> 00:54:17.019
Because again, the basic idea of I will become low.

00:54:17.019 --> 00:54:26.300
That expression is also used at Psalm 113, 6 and 7, the same idea to describe how Jehovah

00:54:26.300 --> 00:54:30.659
comes down in rank to deal with lowly people.

00:54:30.659 --> 00:54:38.699
So David was imitating Jehovah on a continual basis, not just a one-time act.

00:54:38.699 --> 00:54:42.619
He maintained that lowly spirit throughout his life.

00:54:42.619 --> 00:54:47.780
When his dignity was shredded, when his reputation was disgraced, when his authority was challenged,

00:54:47.780 --> 00:54:54.699
when his kingship was threatened, when his very life was on the line, David didn't change.

00:54:54.699 --> 00:54:57.380
This is the big point for you.

00:54:57.380 --> 00:54:58.380
Why?

00:54:58.380 --> 00:55:01.179
Because this is what happens.

00:55:01.179 --> 00:55:02.619
You come to Gilead.

00:55:02.619 --> 00:55:05.179
You learn these wonderful things.

00:55:05.179 --> 00:55:11.019
You apply these Bible principles and you say how great it would be if everyone applied

00:55:11.019 --> 00:55:12.300
these things.

00:55:12.300 --> 00:55:15.300
If everyone did this, it would be utopia.

00:55:15.300 --> 00:55:18.940
And you're convinced that this is right and it is.

00:55:18.940 --> 00:55:20.619
You graduate.

00:55:20.619 --> 00:55:27.699
You return to your assignments and you realize some are doing the opposite of what you have

00:55:27.699 --> 00:55:30.099
been taught.

00:55:30.099 --> 00:55:34.739
After a year or two, you realize, my, these are the ones with the privileges.

00:55:35.619 --> 00:55:37.460
And a measure of authority.

00:55:37.460 --> 00:55:39.460
Hmm.

00:55:39.460 --> 00:55:41.940
What I learned in Gilead, that was good.

00:55:41.940 --> 00:55:42.940
That was great.

00:55:42.940 --> 00:55:44.139
That was perfect.

00:55:44.139 --> 00:55:47.659
That was ideal for a classroom setting.

00:55:47.659 --> 00:55:50.980
But it doesn't work in the real world.

00:55:50.980 --> 00:55:53.420
Now what will you do?

00:55:53.420 --> 00:55:57.940
You could begin to say, I'm trying so hard to apply this.

00:55:57.940 --> 00:55:59.500
No one else is doing it.

00:55:59.500 --> 00:56:03.739
Why should I continue to work so hard?

00:56:03.739 --> 00:56:06.699
What will you do in that situation?

00:56:06.699 --> 00:56:14.139
Will you allow the imperfections of others to sway your lowly attitude?

00:56:14.139 --> 00:56:19.300
Or will you continue to imitate Jehovah God?

00:56:19.300 --> 00:56:21.980
Continue in the way of humility.

00:56:21.980 --> 00:56:27.940
Your goal is to imitate Jehovah God and to act the way he wants you to act.

00:56:27.940 --> 00:56:31.460
And even though it might hurt, even though you might get pinched in the machinery, even

00:56:31.460 --> 00:56:38.619
though it might not be easy, you want to be convinced that ultimately, if you do what

00:56:38.619 --> 00:56:44.019
your Jehovah God wants you to do, if you imitate him and not be molded by the imperfections

00:56:44.019 --> 00:56:48.739
of others, it will work out well for you.

00:56:48.739 --> 00:56:59.019
Do not give up in doing what is right and applying the Bible principles as you've been taught.

00:56:59.019 --> 00:57:01.900
So what do we want you to remember?

00:57:01.900 --> 00:57:08.780
This, go to your assignments dressed in a plain linen robe.

00:57:08.780 --> 00:57:15.219
No crown, no royal garments, no grand entrance, remain humble.

00:57:15.219 --> 00:57:24.500
And remember, with more responsibility, it is a victory to do no harm.

00:57:24.500 --> 00:57:34.380
You do no harm when you view yourself as a nobody, because a nobody does not hurt anybody.

00:57:34.380 --> 00:57:39.380
When you think you're a somebody, you hurt everybody.

00:57:39.380 --> 00:57:44.860
Display loyal love by dancing with the slave girls.

00:57:44.860 --> 00:57:50.900
Make it your aim to continue to treat Jehovah's sheep the way he would treat Jehovah, the

00:57:50.900 --> 00:57:53.780
way he would treat his people.

00:57:53.780 --> 00:58:00.460
And be assured, it is our prayer that Jehovah give you the humility and the wisdom needed

00:58:00.460 --> 00:58:24.280
to say yes when the slave girl asks you, will you dance with me?

00:58:24.280 --> 00:58:29.460
I'm not much on dancing, but I'm going to try that.

00:58:29.460 --> 00:58:33.059
Thank you very much, Brother Newmare.

00:58:33.059 --> 00:58:39.019
For the next part on the program, I have a question for all present.

00:58:39.019 --> 00:58:42.659
Will you sing with me?

00:58:42.659 --> 00:58:48.639
You have to rise to do it.

00:58:48.639 --> 00:58:59.300
So stand and sing song number 108, praise Jehovah for his kingdom based on Revelation 21-2.

00:58:59.300 --> 01:01:22.670
That is song number 108.

01:01:22.670 --> 01:01:31.670
Please be seated.

01:01:31.670 --> 01:01:36.789
To continue with our program, we would now like to invite Brother William Samuelson, who

01:01:36.789 --> 01:01:41.110
serves as an instructor for the Theocratic schools department.

01:01:41.110 --> 01:01:55.199
He will present the following theme, witnessing on every appropriate occasion.

01:01:55.199 --> 01:02:00.280
Our primary way of witnessing is, of course, the door-to-door ministry.

01:02:00.280 --> 01:02:07.480
And Paul said an excellent example in doing this, but he did not limit his ministry to just

01:02:07.480 --> 01:02:10.519
door-to-door or house-to-house.

01:02:10.519 --> 01:02:18.960
Acts 17-17 comments on his taking advantage of an opportunity to witness in the marketplace.

01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:24.559
He was waiting for Silas and Timothy to join him in Athens, and he went to the marketplace

01:02:24.559 --> 01:02:30.599
and the count says he would reason with those who happened to be on hand.

01:02:30.599 --> 01:02:36.719
Well our Gilead students did likewise, even before coming to Gilead, but during the last

01:02:36.719 --> 01:02:41.599
five months they have had some excellent experiences in the field ministry.

01:02:41.599 --> 01:02:47.079
We want you to observe some of these as we re-enact them and pick out the lessons that

01:02:47.079 --> 01:02:51.559
might be helpful to you in your ministry.

01:02:51.559 --> 01:02:58.719
To start with, we're going to see Brother and Sister Van Ling at a public witnessing table

01:02:58.719 --> 01:03:02.639
by a bridge over the Hudson River in Pekipsi.

01:03:02.639 --> 01:03:10.610
Give them your attention.

01:03:10.610 --> 01:03:12.929
What makes a good friend?

01:03:12.929 --> 01:03:14.730
Yes, hello sir.

01:03:14.730 --> 01:03:15.690
What do you think?

01:03:15.690 --> 01:03:17.090
What makes a good friend?

01:03:17.090 --> 01:03:21.010
Oh, if he is honest, I think, and a good company.

01:03:21.010 --> 01:03:22.010
You're absolutely right.

01:03:22.010 --> 01:03:25.329
It's very important to become and make good friends.

01:03:25.329 --> 01:03:26.329
Do you know what?

01:03:26.329 --> 01:03:30.849
The Bible also has some very nice principles to become and make very good friends.

01:03:30.849 --> 01:03:34.929
In fact, this magazine talks about it, and you can take a free copy if you want to.

01:03:34.929 --> 01:03:35.929
No, no, thank you.

01:03:35.929 --> 01:03:37.849
I've already read your magazines before.

01:03:37.849 --> 01:03:38.849
No, thanks.

01:03:38.849 --> 01:03:41.250
Oh, you're more than welcome, but may I ask you a question?

01:03:41.250 --> 01:03:42.250
Yes.

01:03:42.250 --> 01:03:44.130
I hear some kind of a familiar accent.

01:03:44.130 --> 01:03:45.130
Where do you come from?

01:03:45.130 --> 01:03:46.130
From Italy.

01:03:46.130 --> 01:03:47.130
From Italy.

01:03:47.130 --> 01:03:48.130
Isn't that nice?

01:03:48.130 --> 01:03:49.130
We're also from Europe.

01:03:49.130 --> 01:03:50.130
We're from the Netherlands.

01:03:50.130 --> 01:03:51.130
From Netherlands?

01:03:51.130 --> 01:03:52.130
Yeah.

01:03:52.130 --> 01:03:56.570
It's funny because I just come back from a vacation trip there because my son is living

01:03:56.570 --> 01:03:57.570
in Netherlands.

01:03:57.570 --> 01:03:58.570
Wow.

01:03:58.570 --> 01:03:59.570
Really?

01:03:59.570 --> 01:04:02.769
We are living here just for a couple of months to receive missionary training.

01:04:02.769 --> 01:04:03.769
Missionary training.

01:04:03.769 --> 01:04:05.489
What a coincidence.

01:04:05.489 --> 01:04:10.329
My son there in Netherlands is missionary for an evangelical church.

01:04:10.329 --> 01:04:14.809
And he told me that he has quite often a contact with Jehovah's Witnesses.

01:04:14.809 --> 01:04:19.130
And I think, yes, next week, he has an appointment with one of you.

01:04:19.130 --> 01:04:20.130
Isn't that nice?

01:04:20.130 --> 01:04:21.130
No, you can see.

01:04:21.130 --> 01:04:26.650
We are all over the world talking to people about the Bible, Bible principles, and so if

01:04:26.650 --> 01:04:29.210
you have any questions, please feel free to ask.

01:04:29.210 --> 01:04:33.849
We would like to do, but you know, we are very busy for the moment because tomorrow we

01:04:33.849 --> 01:04:34.849
will get married.

01:04:34.849 --> 01:04:35.849
Really?

01:04:35.849 --> 01:04:44.199
That is really amazing.

01:04:44.199 --> 01:04:45.199
Congratulations.

01:04:45.199 --> 01:04:50.480
You know, my husband and I, we are married for 21 years and we really enjoy that because

01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:55.000
you know, it's nice to share things with each other, especially when it's spiritual

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:57.000
things.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:58.000
Well, I do have a question.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.079
I see you are wearing a wedding ring.

01:05:00.079 --> 01:05:03.599
And so, do Jehovah's Witnesses wear it on their left hand, or are they right hand?

01:05:03.599 --> 01:05:09.199
Well, you know, it has no special meaning, but what is important to us is that you apply

01:05:09.199 --> 01:05:13.639
Bible principles in your life and that is really what makes the success of your marriage.

01:05:13.639 --> 01:05:16.480
Oh, that's what we would like also.

01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:18.320
Are you here often?

01:05:18.320 --> 01:05:22.599
Well, we are here today, but we don't know when we will be back again, but you know,

01:05:22.599 --> 01:05:24.320
we live not too far away in Patterson.

01:05:24.440 --> 01:05:28.199
Ah, yes, I know your complex is Patterson, Wal-Kill.

01:05:28.199 --> 01:05:34.360
I've already been there for business reason and I'm always amazed how clean everything

01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:35.360
is there.

01:05:35.360 --> 01:05:40.159
Well, that is nice, but if you like, you can come and visit us and we'll give you a tour

01:05:40.159 --> 01:05:42.519
and if you have some questions, we'll answer them.

01:05:42.519 --> 01:05:45.360
Okay, I know where Patterson is and we will try to do so.

01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:46.679
Okay, I'll have to be one.

01:05:46.679 --> 01:05:47.679
Thank you.

01:05:47.679 --> 01:05:48.679
Have a nice day.

01:05:48.679 --> 01:05:49.679
Thank you.

01:05:49.880 --> 01:05:57.840
And we thank all of you for that fine reenactment.

01:05:57.840 --> 01:06:02.400
Later, this couple did visit the table again.

01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:06.360
Their first visit, they didn't find the vanlings, but on their second visit, they did,

01:06:06.360 --> 01:06:11.679
and this time, they placed the Bible Teachbook with a couple.

01:06:11.679 --> 01:06:17.800
Well, another appropriate occasion to give witness is working business territory.

01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:22.000
In this reenactment, we're going to see Brother and Sister Herady

01:06:22.039 --> 01:06:27.320
and how they were able to preach with success in an Asian food store

01:06:27.320 --> 01:06:33.079
in spite of many customers apparently judging by the impatience of some of these customers,

01:06:33.079 --> 01:06:34.920
this is a New York store.

01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:54.900
Hey, this is nice shop.

01:06:54.900 --> 01:06:56.780
So much is your food.

01:06:56.780 --> 01:06:58.380
We are from Japan.

01:06:58.380 --> 01:07:00.699
Do you have many Japanese customers?

01:07:00.699 --> 01:07:02.059
Yes, time to time.

01:07:02.059 --> 01:07:03.059
It's that store.

01:07:03.059 --> 01:07:05.300
I'm sure they love this store.

01:07:05.300 --> 01:07:05.900
Thank you.

01:07:05.900 --> 01:07:06.659
Here you are.

01:07:06.659 --> 01:07:07.659
Thank you.

01:07:11.500 --> 01:07:14.300
I'd like to give you this invitation.

01:07:14.300 --> 01:07:20.139
Next week, we will have a special convention about Bible at this address.

01:07:20.139 --> 01:07:21.980
Thank you.

01:07:21.980 --> 01:07:27.059
But sorry, me and my husband, we work in this store for a whole day.

01:07:27.059 --> 01:07:28.820
We don't have any vacation.

01:07:28.820 --> 01:07:32.460
We are so busy, so I don't think I can make it.

01:07:32.460 --> 01:07:33.460
Okay, I see.

01:07:33.460 --> 01:07:35.179
You are busy.

01:07:35.179 --> 01:07:36.579
Are you Chinese?

01:07:36.579 --> 01:07:38.059
No, I'm from Laos.

01:07:38.059 --> 01:07:40.260
Wow, are you Russian?

01:07:41.260 --> 01:07:42.260
Wow.

01:07:42.260 --> 01:07:45.500
So now all the other customers are gone.

01:07:45.500 --> 01:07:50.260
If you have three minutes, I have a show to video that I would like to show you.

01:07:50.260 --> 01:07:52.059
Would you like to watch it?

01:07:52.059 --> 01:07:53.059
Sure.

01:07:53.059 --> 01:07:58.739
Now, early ocean lady, watched with close attention the video, why study the Bible?

01:07:58.739 --> 01:08:01.980
Let's see how that conversation continues.

01:08:01.980 --> 01:08:04.500
How do you feel about this video?

01:08:04.500 --> 01:08:05.500
It's very nice.

01:08:05.500 --> 01:08:06.500
It's my language.

01:08:06.500 --> 01:08:07.500
Yes.

01:08:07.579 --> 01:08:11.179
Do you think it would be good to think about these things?

01:08:11.179 --> 01:08:12.420
Yes, I think so.

01:08:12.420 --> 01:08:13.900
It's nice.

01:08:13.900 --> 01:08:16.939
I would like to give you this draft too.

01:08:16.939 --> 01:08:23.739
You think this QR code, you can go to our website, vcojw.org.

01:08:23.739 --> 01:08:26.060
The ocean language is also available.

01:08:26.060 --> 01:08:27.060
Really?

01:08:27.060 --> 01:08:28.060
Even the ocean language?

01:08:28.060 --> 01:08:29.060
Yeah.

01:08:29.060 --> 01:08:30.060
Okay, I'll check it.

01:08:30.060 --> 01:08:31.060
Okay.

01:08:31.060 --> 01:08:32.060
Please enjoy it.

01:08:32.060 --> 01:08:38.109
You can find so many good things in Laos and there.

01:08:38.109 --> 01:08:43.869
No, brother and sister Rady didn't leave the store in their mind.

01:08:43.869 --> 01:08:46.229
They were back to further that interest.

01:08:46.229 --> 01:08:49.729
Let's observe next visit.

01:08:49.729 --> 01:08:52.130
Today too, we buy this.

01:08:52.130 --> 01:08:53.130
Okay.

01:08:53.130 --> 01:08:55.729
By the way, did you check out that site?

01:08:55.729 --> 01:08:56.729
Yes.

01:08:56.729 --> 01:08:58.729
There are really many Laos and information.

01:08:58.729 --> 01:08:59.729
I really enjoyed it.

01:08:59.729 --> 01:09:00.729
Wow.

01:09:00.729 --> 01:09:01.729
I'm glad to hear that.

01:09:01.729 --> 01:09:05.770
But today you have so many customers, right?

01:09:05.770 --> 01:09:06.770
Yes.

01:09:06.890 --> 01:09:09.810
Today, I'd like to give you these magazines.

01:09:09.810 --> 01:09:12.449
I choose these magazines for you.

01:09:12.449 --> 01:09:13.449
Thank you.

01:09:13.449 --> 01:09:14.449
Stress?

01:09:14.449 --> 01:09:16.050
It's necessary for me.

01:09:16.050 --> 01:09:17.489
I read it later.

01:09:17.489 --> 01:09:20.289
Enjoy it.

01:09:20.289 --> 01:09:21.289
Very good.

01:09:21.289 --> 01:09:33.079
Brother and sister Rady, and by the way, they did get a different fish.

01:09:33.079 --> 01:09:38.560
And they were also able to find a good news brochure in Laos and which impressed the

01:09:38.560 --> 01:09:41.319
lady very much.

01:09:41.319 --> 01:09:47.880
Familiar scriptures, Acts 20, and as we mentioned, that verse shows the primary way in which we

01:09:47.880 --> 01:09:51.119
carry on our ministry, House to House.

01:09:51.119 --> 01:09:56.359
While our Gilead students were alert to every upper appropriate occasion while in the House

01:09:56.359 --> 01:10:03.600
to House of Industry, let's see how sister Cardoso's noticing the accent of her householder

01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:09.399
led to a fine witness.

01:10:09.399 --> 01:10:10.399
Good morning.

01:10:10.399 --> 01:10:11.399
How are you today?

01:10:11.399 --> 01:10:12.399
I'm fine.

01:10:12.399 --> 01:10:13.399
Thank you.

01:10:13.399 --> 01:10:14.399
Good.

01:10:14.399 --> 01:10:15.399
My name is Jessica, and this is my friend Amber.

01:10:15.399 --> 01:10:18.279
And we'd just like to share a nice thought with you from the Bible.

01:10:18.279 --> 01:10:19.279
The Bible?

01:10:19.279 --> 01:10:20.279
No.

01:10:20.279 --> 01:10:23.960
You want to talk to my wife, but she is not at home today.

01:10:23.960 --> 01:10:24.960
OK.

01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:25.960
Maybe I can talk to her another time.

01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:26.960
But can I ask you a question?

01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:27.960
Do you speak Portuguese?

01:10:27.960 --> 01:10:28.960
Yes, I do.

01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:29.960
So do I.

01:10:29.960 --> 01:10:30.960
Where are you from?

01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:31.960
Mozambique.

01:10:31.960 --> 01:10:32.960
Oh, I'm from Angola.

01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:35.359
My husband and I have lived there for quite some time.

01:10:35.359 --> 01:10:37.000
We're also from Africa.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.920
Maybe I could bring him by sometime to meet you, would that be OK?

01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:40.920
Sounds good.

01:10:40.920 --> 01:10:41.920
OK.

01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:42.920
Ciao.

01:10:42.920 --> 01:10:43.920
Ciao.

01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:49.119
Now, this man didn't seem particularly interested in the truth, but let's see what

01:10:49.119 --> 01:10:56.239
took place with that bit of information, how it helped for the next visit.

01:10:56.239 --> 01:10:57.239
Bondeia.

01:10:57.239 --> 01:10:58.239
Bola.

01:10:58.239 --> 01:10:59.239
Bondeia.

01:10:59.239 --> 01:11:00.239
My name is Orlando.

01:11:00.239 --> 01:11:01.239
Hi.

01:11:01.239 --> 01:11:02.239
I'm from Orlando.

01:11:02.239 --> 01:11:03.239
I hear you're from Angola.

01:11:03.239 --> 01:11:04.239
It's true.

01:11:04.239 --> 01:11:07.439
I lived there since 1995, and my wife taught me that you are from Mozambique.

01:11:07.439 --> 01:11:11.960
It's so good to meet someone here from another Portuguese speaking country in Africa.

01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:13.760
Do you live here for a long time?

01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:17.680
I am from Mozambique, but you're now for 20 years.

01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:23.079
Oh, I can imagine, Fernando, you have been through a lot during your youth, you must

01:11:23.079 --> 01:11:28.560
have seen the colonial war, the civil war, and a lot of broken promises.

01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:31.600
Yes, many, many problems.

01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:34.239
Have you ever wondered, Fernando?

01:11:34.239 --> 01:11:36.640
Why God allows all this suffering?

01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:42.079
You know, I think something is out there, but I do not know if it is God.

01:11:42.079 --> 01:11:45.720
You must have given a lot of thought to it, and I'm happy to know that you believe that

01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:47.520
there is something.

01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:51.399
Wouldn't it be reasonable to believe that if there is a God, he would let us know about

01:11:51.399 --> 01:11:52.399
him?

01:11:52.399 --> 01:11:54.960
Let me share scripture with you.

01:11:54.960 --> 01:12:02.319
And second Timothy, 316, says, all scripture is inspired of God.

01:12:02.319 --> 01:12:06.159
So the Bible claims to be the inspired book of God, and the next time I would like to show

01:12:06.239 --> 01:12:10.800
you what convinced me that the Bible is really a book of God, and I would like to show you

01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:13.319
a brief video, why we should study the Bible.

01:12:13.319 --> 01:12:14.319
What do you think, Fernando?

01:12:14.319 --> 01:12:15.319
Sounds good.

01:12:15.319 --> 01:12:16.800
See you next time.

01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:17.800
Ciao.

01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:18.800
Ciao.

01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:24.880
No, Father and Sister Cardozo, how did this experience continue, and some interesting

01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:26.800
side point?

01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:30.479
After we spoke to him, we were able to go to the house and meet his wife, and we found

01:12:30.479 --> 01:12:34.960
out that she's already studying the Bible with the Portuguese congregation, and she told

01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:38.960
us while we were talking to him, she was looking through the window, watching us, and she

01:12:38.960 --> 01:12:41.840
was hoping that her husband would show interest in the truth.

01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:45.600
So she was very happy to find out that the conversation had gone so well.

01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:47.760
So what happened when you went back, Orlando?

01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:52.239
The next time we visited him, we were able to show him the why study the Bible video,

01:12:52.239 --> 01:12:54.439
and I think it was a turning point.

01:12:54.439 --> 01:12:59.239
From there on, he showed far more interest than we were even able to establish a doorstep

01:12:59.239 --> 01:13:00.239
study with him.

01:13:00.239 --> 01:13:01.239
Excellent.

01:13:01.239 --> 01:13:02.560
And it's still progressing.

01:13:02.560 --> 01:13:03.800
It's still progressing.

01:13:03.800 --> 01:13:13.930
Thank you very much.

01:13:13.930 --> 01:13:19.689
While doing our house to house ministry, we should not ignore people that we may meet

01:13:19.689 --> 01:13:21.489
on the street.

01:13:21.489 --> 01:13:26.329
It may be a fine opportunity to give a witness to them as well.

01:13:26.329 --> 01:13:29.329
Now this is exactly what Sister Nielsen did.

01:13:29.329 --> 01:13:30.329
Let's observe.

01:13:30.329 --> 01:13:35.329
Hey, Amber, this woman looks Arabic, and I speak Arabic.

01:13:35.329 --> 01:13:36.970
What do you say she'll be speaking to her?

01:13:36.970 --> 01:13:37.970
Yes, absolutely.

01:13:37.970 --> 01:13:38.970
Okay.

01:13:39.250 --> 01:13:41.329
Peace be upon you.

01:13:41.329 --> 01:13:42.329
Peace be upon you.

01:13:42.329 --> 01:13:43.090
Peace be upon you.

01:13:43.090 --> 01:13:43.609
Okay, thank you.

01:13:43.609 --> 01:13:44.770
Our name is Kamila.

01:13:44.770 --> 01:13:45.770
What's your name?

01:13:45.770 --> 01:13:46.970
I'm Jamala Tasharraf.

01:13:46.970 --> 01:13:55.470
I'm actually the reason why I stopped you is because I have this magazine that I would

01:13:55.470 --> 01:13:57.430
like to present to you.

01:13:57.430 --> 01:13:58.449
I can see that you are Muslim, right?

01:13:58.449 --> 01:13:59.449
Yes.

01:13:59.449 --> 01:14:00.449
Where are you from?

01:14:00.449 --> 01:14:01.449
I'm from Yemen.

01:14:01.449 --> 01:14:03.149
Oh, nice to meet you.

01:14:03.149 --> 01:14:06.510
This magazine is about prayer.

01:14:06.510 --> 01:14:07.510
We Muslims.

01:14:07.510 --> 01:14:14.529
we pray five times a day. Thank you. Very nice. The conversation continues. Our

01:14:14.529 --> 01:14:21.369
sisters make an appointment with Jamal to meet the following week and a few

01:14:21.369 --> 01:14:26.930
visits later. They're into a Bible study in the Good News brochure. Let's look

01:14:26.930 --> 01:14:32.869
in on one of those studies. So Jamala, after we read this scripture, don't you

01:14:32.869 --> 01:14:38.670
think it's wonderful that God loves us so much? I never thought about that, but

01:14:38.670 --> 01:14:43.829
this is all written in the Quran. I don't need the Bible. Okay. I know many Muslims

01:14:43.829 --> 01:14:49.430
say this, but maybe I can ask you a question if you permit me. The Quran is

01:14:49.430 --> 01:14:54.029
written for Muslims, right? Yes. So how would you feel if I as a Christian touched

01:14:54.029 --> 01:14:59.069
the Quran? No, no, no. You cannot do that. Okay. But you see the Bible is for

01:14:59.069 --> 01:15:04.510
everybody. So what it says here in the Bible that applies to you too. You can

01:15:04.510 --> 01:15:10.750
hold it if you want. That means that God's thoughts about you are not of

01:15:10.750 --> 01:15:16.109
calamity as it says in the scripture. He wants you to have success in life. And the

01:15:16.109 --> 01:15:20.989
only way we can have success in life is to get to know God's personality. And when

01:15:20.989 --> 01:15:25.350
we read in the Bible, we come to know His personality. This is the reason why we

01:15:25.350 --> 01:15:29.670
go around and talk to people because in that way we can help people to get to

01:15:29.670 --> 01:15:35.270
love Him. But I don't know. I don't think that's possible to to love God or to

01:15:35.270 --> 01:15:41.789
get to know Allah. We cannot see Him. Yes, but think about this. Is it really

01:15:41.789 --> 01:15:46.869
impossible for us humans to love someone that we haven't seen? What about all

01:15:46.869 --> 01:15:51.430
those who write letters to each other? And they fall in love on the basis of

01:15:51.430 --> 01:15:54.710
those letters, even though they live in two different countries, they've never seen

01:15:54.710 --> 01:15:59.069
each other or those who fall in love on the internet. I mean, I don't

01:15:59.069 --> 01:16:06.789
recommend it. But it does show. It does show that we humans, we are capable of

01:16:06.789 --> 01:16:11.109
loving someone that we haven't seen, right? It's not safe to love someone on the

01:16:11.109 --> 01:16:17.069
internet. But when it comes to loving God who's perfect and who only wants the

01:16:17.069 --> 01:16:21.789
best for us, there's nothing safe for us humans. This is the only way we can

01:16:21.789 --> 01:16:28.710
become happy. So when you study the Bible, you find reasons, so many reasons to

01:16:28.710 --> 01:16:34.270
love God. And actually, next time we could take up the subject about God's name,

01:16:34.270 --> 01:16:39.510
would you like that? That sounds so interesting. You made me think maybe I should get

01:16:39.510 --> 01:16:50.229
to know the Bible a little bit better. Thank you, sisters, very much. And

01:16:50.829 --> 01:16:55.750
Camila and Camila had many good studies over the summer, and that interest is

01:16:55.750 --> 01:17:01.949
also continuing. At times in our House to House work, we find people that are

01:17:01.949 --> 01:17:07.989
at the moment busy. How can we turn that into an appropriate occasion to

01:17:07.989 --> 01:17:13.550
witness? Sister Chung, you had an experience with that. Tell us about it. In our

01:17:13.550 --> 01:17:17.630
House to House Ministry, we've met a Chinese woman who cannot speak English

01:17:17.670 --> 01:17:22.789
very well. And since she was working in her garden, she was very busy. So we

01:17:22.789 --> 01:17:26.829
briefly explained the purpose of our visit and gave her the latest

01:17:26.829 --> 01:17:31.989
magazines and made arrangement for a return visit. Okay, show us what happened

01:17:31.989 --> 01:17:43.689
on that return visit. Mrs. Rose, thank you for inviting us come in. We

01:17:43.689 --> 01:17:46.930
very nice to meet you again because last week you heard that you went to see

01:17:46.930 --> 01:17:52.090
your daughter, right? Yes, she is pregnant, but the doctor said she could

01:17:52.090 --> 01:18:02.850
lose this baby. I'm so bullied because she lost her first baby. You think that

01:18:02.850 --> 01:18:09.689
about three years ago, my husband died. I'm so sorry to hear that. It's very hard

01:18:09.689 --> 01:18:14.970
to imagine how could you deal with so many things. I'm so sorry. This is why

01:18:14.970 --> 01:18:19.569
today we are here. You'd like to show you very encouraging, very comfortable

01:18:19.569 --> 01:18:25.770
news from the Bible. Can you do that? Yes, actually, my daughter also going to

01:18:25.770 --> 01:18:33.369
church every week and she gave me a big Chinese Bible, but I never opened it

01:18:33.369 --> 01:18:38.529
yet. Oh, it's very glad to hear that you have your own Bible. Would you mind

01:18:38.529 --> 01:18:48.529
bring out the Bible? This is convenient for you. Okay, let me see. Where it is?

01:18:48.529 --> 01:19:00.289
Here it is. It's a really big Bible. It's really big. Thank you for bringing out this.

01:19:00.289 --> 01:19:06.970
Mrs. Rose, have you ever thought about God has a name? God has a name? Yes,

01:19:06.970 --> 01:19:12.569
everyone has a name. You and me also have a name. Likewise, God also has a name.

01:19:12.569 --> 01:19:20.609
And Bible tells us what it is. So let's open the Bible, scripture, Psalms, chapter 83,

01:19:20.609 --> 01:19:28.449
verse 18. Would you please read here? Okay, this is the very first time to open my

01:19:28.449 --> 01:19:36.210
Bible and read it. May people know that you, whose name is Jehovah, you along

01:19:36.210 --> 01:19:42.369
are the most high over all the earth. Thank you for a nice reading. Did you notice

01:19:42.369 --> 01:19:50.770
the, what is the name of God? Jehovah, Jehovah, is this God's name? Yes, Jehovah,

01:19:50.770 --> 01:19:56.529
this is the God's name. And the scripture keeps saying he along are the most high

01:19:56.529 --> 01:20:02.770
over all the earth. It means he knows, he understands everything what we are

01:20:03.170 --> 01:20:10.050
facing daily, including you and your family. And he really cares about you. So today I brought

01:20:10.050 --> 01:20:18.369
a brochure. The name is Good News from God. He has good news for you. And this is a copy for you.

01:20:18.369 --> 01:20:24.930
Thank you. And here, this brochure is very simply designed to help people to learn about God

01:20:24.930 --> 01:20:31.409
and the Bible. And his second page tells us how can you benefit from this brochure? And how can

01:20:31.489 --> 01:20:38.609
you find the scripture from your own Bible by yourself? So can we study together? I would love to.

01:20:40.609 --> 01:20:53.420
Thank you, Sister Chung and your assistants. Sister Chung's kind manners, her readiness to use

01:20:53.420 --> 01:21:01.340
the householder's Bible. Certainly on this occasion made the day. Well, on rare occasions,

01:21:01.340 --> 01:21:07.659
we may find an appropriate occasion to witness even if we aren't the one to start the conversation.

01:21:08.859 --> 01:21:15.659
Let's see what happened as Brother Nielsen. Dennis was returning to his car in a parking lot

01:21:15.659 --> 01:21:24.220
after making a return visit. Hello. Hello. How are you? I'm fine with you. I'm fine. My name is

01:21:24.220 --> 01:21:35.180
Dennis. This is Aaron. Do I know you? No. I'm just being friendly. Oh, that's so nice of you.

01:21:35.180 --> 01:21:39.739
We don't meet a lot of friendly people these days. Don't you agree? Yes, but I think it's important

01:21:39.739 --> 01:21:45.260
to be friendly. I agree. You know, we actually share a wonderful magazine with people about what makes

01:21:45.260 --> 01:21:52.300
a real friend. That magazine is very interesting. My wife and I actually want to quit smoking.

01:21:52.939 --> 01:21:58.060
Ah, you speak about the watchtower about God's view of smoking. Yes. That's a very good goal.

01:21:58.699 --> 01:22:05.579
Yes. Want to do it because of our son. Want to change our lives completely. I don't want my son

01:22:05.579 --> 01:22:11.100
to grow up with bad parents. We live in a bad way. We're so smoking. We're in his in our own health.

01:22:11.899 --> 01:22:17.739
That's very good. You know, this magazine, it's going to help you. There's also a scripture in the

01:22:17.739 --> 01:22:22.539
Bible that speaks about God's view of smoking. I think it will help you too. It's a second

01:22:22.539 --> 01:22:31.500
Corinthians chapter 1 and verse chapter 7 and verse 1. Can I read it to you? Okay. Thanks. See,

01:22:31.500 --> 01:22:38.619
it says, let us cleanse ourselves of every defilement of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in

01:22:38.619 --> 01:22:44.619
the fear of God. So this scripture says that if we should be acceptable to God, we should cleanse

01:22:44.619 --> 01:22:51.100
ourselves of every defilement of the body. What do you think? Does smoking defile our body?

01:22:51.819 --> 01:22:58.140
Yes. That's why I want to quit. And that's very good. And you know, knowing that God wants you to

01:22:58.140 --> 01:23:04.539
quit smoking, that will help you to do it. But it seems like you're in a hurry. Yes. I'm waiting for

01:23:04.539 --> 01:23:11.260
my wife who will live as soon as she comes. Ah, okay. So maybe I can just show you our website.

01:23:11.260 --> 01:23:17.420
If you take the magazines on the back, you can see this QR code. If you scan it with your phone,

01:23:17.420 --> 01:23:21.979
it will bring you directly to our website. Maybe Aaron can show you on his phone how to do it.

01:23:21.979 --> 01:23:30.800
I'll be happy to show you. It's very easy, you see? You just scan the code and the webpage

01:23:30.800 --> 01:23:36.880
appears automatically. Very easy. And you know in this website, you can find many good things from

01:23:36.960 --> 01:23:43.600
the Bible about how to attain a happy family. And you said you have a son? Yes. And on this webpage,

01:23:43.600 --> 01:23:48.319
JW.org, there are many nice videos for children. I'm sure your son will like them.

01:23:49.359 --> 01:23:54.800
But Ivan, I would love to continue this conversation another time and explain to you what God's

01:23:54.800 --> 01:24:01.199
promise for us is for the future. Could we do that? Yeah, welcome. I leave it number 89. Ah, thanks.

01:24:01.520 --> 01:24:15.489
Thank you, brothers. Did you notice how quickly Dennis picked up on what interested the man?

01:24:16.130 --> 01:24:22.130
Wasn't the article on stress, but the one on tobacco. He went back the following Sunday and was

01:24:22.130 --> 01:24:28.850
happy to cultivate Ivan's interest even further. Well, at times, we call on a person that may have

01:24:28.850 --> 01:24:34.850
showed some interest. And when we get back, we find a different member of the family. Could this

01:24:34.850 --> 01:24:41.010
be a good opportunity to witness? Well, let's see what happened when brother and sister Kassush found

01:24:41.010 --> 01:24:53.890
this situation. Come in. Hello. Hello. My name is Daniel. My name is Yustena. I'm Emmy. Nice

01:24:53.890 --> 01:24:58.850
to meet you. Nice to meet you, Emmy. We see that you are very busy today. Oh, yes. You know,

01:24:58.850 --> 01:25:04.050
we're three kids. It's a lot of work. Yeah, it's not easy. So we'll be brief. We've spoken with

01:25:04.050 --> 01:25:09.890
your husband recently and he said that you're from Gambia. Am I right? Actually, he is from Gambia

01:25:09.890 --> 01:25:15.649
and then from the USA. Where are you from? We are from Poland. And you know, we left your husband

01:25:15.649 --> 01:25:21.890
with a question who really rules this world? What is your opinion? Oh, for me, that's clear. It's

01:25:21.890 --> 01:25:29.409
Satan. Yes, you're right. And please, look what the Bible says about Satan's future here.

01:25:30.369 --> 01:25:39.569
For his part, the God who gives peace will crush Satan under your feet shortly. Did you notice

01:25:39.569 --> 01:25:46.210
what will happen with Satan? He will be destroyed? Yes, again, right. And please listen to the short

01:25:46.210 --> 01:25:54.130
comment about his scripture. Empowered by God, Jesus will destroy Satan. Then God will rule mankind

01:25:54.130 --> 01:25:59.250
and restore the human race to the life of happiness and peace he originally intended.

01:26:00.130 --> 01:26:06.689
Did you do you think that is possible? Yes, actually, I am praying for the peace not only for my

01:26:06.689 --> 01:26:13.489
family, but for others as well. It's wonderful. We see that you are very religious person. This book,

01:26:13.489 --> 01:26:19.489
what does the Bible really teach, provides us much more information. It answers very important

01:26:20.289 --> 01:26:26.050
questions what is God's purpose for the earth. So the next time we gladly show you the Bible-based

01:26:26.050 --> 01:26:33.329
answer. And this book is for you. Really? Can I give it? Yes, you can. Is it really mine? Yes, you know,

01:26:33.329 --> 01:26:39.010
I'm so happy to have this book. You know, my friend Brenda, she has this book and I know it speaks

01:26:39.010 --> 01:26:44.289
about family life that the husband is the head of the family. Now, I'm so happy I have my own copy.

01:26:44.289 --> 01:26:49.489
And we are sure you will make very good use of it. Sure. So is it okay for you if you come the

01:26:49.489 --> 01:26:55.569
next Saturday, exactly the same time? Yes, sure. So see you on Saturday. And please say hello to your

01:26:55.569 --> 01:27:10.420
husband, Mr. Sanku. I will. Goodbye. Thank you. Thank you. It's evident that when we try to witness

01:27:10.420 --> 01:27:16.819
two different members of the family, we expand our territory. We increase the opportunities to

01:27:16.819 --> 01:27:25.140
give a good witness. Well, now we're going to look at a situation. It occurs for all of us from

01:27:25.140 --> 01:27:31.859
time to time, not the same situation, however. But informal witnessing also presents a fine

01:27:31.859 --> 01:27:37.699
opportunity to spread the good news. We have a brother and sister, Sisaber. They used an

01:27:37.699 --> 01:27:42.659
opportunity to witness when having breakfast in their hotel just before coming to Gilead.

01:27:43.619 --> 01:27:49.779
So are you here to visit New York City? No, not really Fernando. We got invited to a

01:27:49.779 --> 01:27:55.140
Bible school in Patterson. So today we are off of five months of studying the Bible to Patterson.

01:27:55.140 --> 01:28:00.739
We're really excited and happy. Oh, that's interesting. Yeah. And how is it with you, Kamolatino?

01:28:00.739 --> 01:28:06.180
Most probably you believe in the Bible and God, don't you? Yes, of course. I believe in God, but

01:28:06.739 --> 01:28:13.779
you know, I have a little daughter and she always asked me, Papa, does God exist? How do you know

01:28:13.779 --> 01:28:19.539
if you don't see him? You know what? I really don't know what to tell her. But I would like to give

01:28:19.539 --> 01:28:26.659
some answer for her. I can imagine. It's not an easy question. You know, I have here a card. Look,

01:28:27.699 --> 01:28:35.300
in this card, you would find a lot of very interesting response to your questions.

01:28:35.300 --> 01:28:41.380
You would find also some downloads, but also you would find a page especially for the kids to

01:28:41.380 --> 01:28:47.619
answer those kind of questions. You know, Fernando, I'm sure you would love it. Oh, especially for

01:28:47.619 --> 01:28:52.739
kids. They have very beautiful animations on that page. They're short and they teach really

01:28:52.739 --> 01:29:09.699
good lessons. I have even one here. Have a look. And shoppers, stop by our bakery for today's

01:29:10.100 --> 01:29:51.619
special. Time to check out. No candy today. If you steal, will you be Jehovah's friend?

01:29:52.739 --> 01:30:14.140
Do you want to be Jehovah's friend? Oh, this is beautiful. I've been looking for a long time

01:30:14.140 --> 01:30:19.260
for some guidance for my family. And you know what? Just recently, we talked about it with my wife.

01:30:19.979 --> 01:30:24.859
We feel very lonely and talk looking for a chance. You know, Fernando, you are more than

01:30:24.859 --> 01:30:31.180
being venido any time in our kingdom halls here. Oh, I know one in Elisabeth. Yeah,

01:30:31.180 --> 01:30:36.460
yeah, exactly. For sure, you find really good friends there. Why don't you just have a look?

01:30:36.460 --> 01:30:42.300
It's without any commitment. Okay, I will tell to my wife about it. Thank you for the website.

01:30:42.300 --> 01:30:49.100
And tonight, I will watch some with my family. Thank you. Thank you. Now,

01:30:49.899 --> 01:30:55.579
brothers and sisters, the Saber had an unexpected result from this. Tell us about it.

01:30:55.579 --> 01:31:01.579
Yeah, because of that conversation, another waiter approached me and I found out that he speaks Arabic,

01:31:01.579 --> 01:31:07.579
so I passed him on to Karim. And then we started discussing Elisabeth. He realized we were talking

01:31:07.579 --> 01:31:12.699
about God, so he was very interested. And as we happened to have some Arabic magazines,

01:31:12.699 --> 01:31:17.739
so I give it to him. And as a matter of fact, the next day, he was flying back to Egypt to get

01:31:17.739 --> 01:31:23.979
married. So he said, well, we chitchat at a bit. And then he took a lot of Arabic magazine,

01:31:23.979 --> 01:31:28.939
and he took them to Egypt as a gift for his new family. Thank you very much.

01:31:29.899 --> 01:31:47.260
Informal witnessing and have wide results. As beneficial as our demonstrations are at our service

01:31:47.260 --> 01:31:56.220
meeting, generally, they're prepared, presented, and we learn much from them. However, what we saw

01:31:56.220 --> 01:32:03.979
here were actual experiences reenacted. We hope that you've found some things that you can use

01:32:03.979 --> 01:32:12.619
in your ministry, not just to take every opportunity to preach, but the lessons, how they did it,

01:32:12.619 --> 01:32:20.380
where they did it. These will be invaluable as you too use every appropriate occasion to bear

01:32:20.380 --> 01:32:47.779
witness. We certainly want to thank you, brother Samerson. That was most encouraging. I used to be

01:32:47.779 --> 01:32:54.960
in karma up here. I didn't find anybody, but now I'm going to work harder. They're out there. We

01:32:54.960 --> 01:33:02.319
just have to find them. For the next part, we invite brother William Nantes, who works in the

01:33:02.319 --> 01:33:08.640
service department, to conduct an interview with two couples from this class of Gilead. The couples

01:33:08.640 --> 01:33:18.079
are Harrison and Snellia Mosseko. I said that right, didn't I? And, of course, Dennis and

01:33:18.159 --> 01:33:27.359
Camilla Nielsen. Brother Nalky's theme is, continue available for Kingdom of Service.

01:33:29.630 --> 01:33:36.750
All who are invited to Gilead at present are already serving as special full-time servants.

01:33:36.750 --> 01:33:43.310
It may be in the traveling work, Bethel service, or as-field missionaries. They have thus made

01:33:43.390 --> 01:33:53.069
themselves available. As Isaiah 6.8 says, they've said, here I am, send me. They have also shown that

01:33:53.069 --> 01:33:59.390
they wish to continue being available for Kingdom of Service because they've come to Gilead

01:33:59.390 --> 01:34:05.869
and have gone through the course here. For a few minutes, we will be visiting with these two

01:34:06.829 --> 01:34:15.710
couples, brother and sister Mosseko, Harrison and Snellia, served as Bethelites in Malawi, Bethel,

01:34:15.710 --> 01:34:24.189
in East Africa. Brother and sister Nielsen, Dennis and Camilla are serving as field missionaries

01:34:24.189 --> 01:34:32.750
with the Arabic-speaking group in Parma, Italy. And as we visit with them, we'll be asking first

01:34:32.750 --> 01:34:39.869
some experiences from their former assignments, and second, how Gilead has helped prepare them

01:34:39.869 --> 01:34:46.430
for continued availability for Kingdom service. Snellia, we'd like to talk with you.

01:34:46.430 --> 01:34:54.350
We understand you were born while our work was under ban in Malawi. Tell us how long was the ban?

01:34:55.229 --> 01:35:03.949
Well, the ban was from 1967 to August 1993, so it was about 26 years long.

01:35:04.989 --> 01:35:09.550
And what was it like as a youth growing up and our work being banned?

01:35:10.270 --> 01:35:18.430
Since I was born during the ban, to me life seemed normal. All I knew is we attend meetings at midnight

01:35:19.229 --> 01:35:30.079
and we don't sing at meetings and we upload by rubbing our hands like this until 1993 when the

01:35:30.079 --> 01:35:36.880
ban was lifted and then the first missionaries came. And right away I joined with them in

01:35:36.880 --> 01:35:42.159
street witnessing, which I liked so much. Midnight meetings, we'll have to think on that.

01:35:42.640 --> 01:35:53.359
But now we understand too that as you approach the end of school, you wanted to regular pioneer.

01:35:53.359 --> 01:35:59.840
You turned in an application, you were approved as a pioneer, but you never took up the pioneer

01:35:59.840 --> 01:36:06.159
service. What happened? So what happened is that a few months before finishing high school,

01:36:06.159 --> 01:36:11.760
I applied to start regular pioneering in the math of September, that was 1996.

01:36:12.479 --> 01:36:20.640
So while I was waiting for the approval, I would visit Bethel very often just to check if they have

01:36:20.640 --> 01:36:28.000
wake or they need help or just to let them know that I'm available. So I'll do that many times.

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:35.199
So one day I was invited as a temporary Bethelite and by the time the appointment for regular

01:36:35.199 --> 01:36:41.760
pioneering came, I was already in Bethel and which was my goal. I wanted really to say what Bethel.

01:36:42.720 --> 01:36:48.800
And we're glad you've been there ever since. But Harrison, we understand you were born in Zambia

01:36:48.800 --> 01:36:58.560
and yet now you're in Malawi serving. Can you explain? So in the 60s, before the work was banned in Malawi,

01:36:59.279 --> 01:37:05.039
the Malawi branch was responsible for translating the Chichewa language publications,

01:37:06.399 --> 01:37:11.119
which is the language that is spoken in Malawi parts of Zambia and parts of Mozambique.

01:37:12.159 --> 01:37:17.359
Now when the work was under banned in Malawi, that translation department was moved to Zimbabwe

01:37:17.359 --> 01:37:23.199
branch. Later it was moved to Zambia branch. It was during that time when it was in Zambia that I

01:37:23.199 --> 01:37:31.439
joined the translation of the Chichewa team as a translator. And when the ban was lifted in Malawi,

01:37:31.439 --> 01:37:37.279
it was decided that this team for the Chichewa language moves back to Malawi where it originally

01:37:37.279 --> 01:37:43.840
came from. And so we moved altogether as a team in 1997. And in Malawi, I met my wife,

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:50.640
Nadia. And what joys have you had in Bethel service in Malawi in addition to gaining a wife?

01:37:54.000 --> 01:38:02.239
Just as a translator sitting down every day and discussing God's word and various publications

01:38:02.239 --> 01:38:08.479
of the faithful and discrete slave brings me a measurable joy in my heart. And so when the branch

01:38:08.560 --> 01:38:13.920
committee invited us to apply for Gilead, we couldn't help but wonder how will this work,

01:38:13.920 --> 01:38:18.640
how will this training prepare our hearts for the work that we have ahead and we just couldn't

01:38:18.640 --> 01:38:27.039
wait to come. And Dennis and Camila, you hold the recently you've been serving as field missionaries

01:38:27.039 --> 01:38:34.319
in Italy among the Arabic speaking group. Previously we understand you pioneered for several years

01:38:34.399 --> 01:38:40.560
in Egypt while our work was under more severe restrictions at the time. You mentioned that there

01:38:40.560 --> 01:38:47.680
were several occasions when you felt sure you saw Jehovah's Hand in Matters. Can you explain one

01:38:47.680 --> 01:38:56.000
of those? Yes, one example of this was at a time we were in Denmark to work. And during that time

01:38:56.000 --> 01:39:01.439
there was a very strong pressure from the government more than the usual. They would usually

01:39:01.439 --> 01:39:06.960
tab our phones and they would send agents to follow us on the street. But at this particular time

01:39:06.960 --> 01:39:14.319
they were doing many more things to disturb us. And in addition to that we also had a political

01:39:14.319 --> 01:39:20.960
conflict that broke out between Egypt and Denmark. Because Denmark, a Danish newspaper had printed

01:39:20.960 --> 01:39:29.439
some drawings that was offensive to the Muslims. So in the airport we would always be pulled aside

01:39:29.520 --> 01:39:36.239
in the passport control and our bags would be searched in and out. But with this political conflict

01:39:36.239 --> 01:39:40.880
we were very much afraid about what was going to happen. Maybe they would interrogate us.

01:39:40.880 --> 01:39:45.039
And if they did that, which they had a good reason to run these circumstances,

01:39:45.039 --> 01:39:50.640
it would really increase the problems for us. So I remember in the flight back we were praying and

01:39:50.640 --> 01:39:56.159
praying to Jehovah for his help and wisdom to face this problem that we had. And then what happened?

01:39:56.159 --> 01:40:00.720
You will not believe it. When we arrived in the airport a big surprise awaited us.

01:40:01.359 --> 01:40:08.880
The whole computer system had broken down. And they just had to check all the passports manually.

01:40:08.880 --> 01:40:14.000
So they couldn't see that we were supposed to be stopped and taken aside. So they just let everybody in

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:22.640
and that included us. Now more recently you've transferred into the field missionary work.

01:40:23.359 --> 01:40:29.279
And this was a change from pioneering. What challenges has that presented for you?

01:40:30.239 --> 01:40:35.600
For me personally, when you have to start living as a special full-time minister,

01:40:36.159 --> 01:40:41.119
my obedience to Jehovah and the organization was put a little bit to the test.

01:40:42.319 --> 01:40:49.439
Because there are some restrictions that you have to submit. And suddenly decisions that

01:40:49.520 --> 01:40:54.800
me and Dennis, we would usually just do us personally. Now suddenly other people are making those

01:40:54.800 --> 01:41:01.439
decisions for us. So there was some personal freedom that we had to sacrifice. And what can happen

01:41:01.439 --> 01:41:06.960
is that one puts too much focus on the sacrifices and then forget about the blessings that comes.

01:41:07.600 --> 01:41:13.279
So I learned that it was very important for me to be obedient and to enjoy, especially in the

01:41:13.279 --> 01:41:18.640
beginning where it's maybe a little bit difficult. But I found out that you cannot serve as a special

01:41:18.640 --> 01:41:25.199
full-time minister if you're not obedient to Jehovah. Dennis, how about you, especially with the

01:41:25.199 --> 01:41:33.520
field being quite different from everyone around you speaking Arabic? Yes, I feel I've learned to

01:41:33.520 --> 01:41:38.800
be satisfied with the place that Jehovah gives me in his organization and to have my heart

01:41:38.800 --> 01:41:45.920
where my feet are. Because in the beginning when we came from Egypt to Italy, Egypt was a place

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:52.159
with a tremendous need. And in all my imperfection in the beginning I felt a little bit misplaced in

01:41:52.159 --> 01:41:58.640
Italy. I was continually looking back. I felt that I could do much more in Egypt than I could do in

01:41:58.640 --> 01:42:07.520
Italy. But with prayer and with study and with discussions with Camilla, slowly I started to realize

01:42:07.520 --> 01:42:12.479
and learn that it's not really important where I served Jehovah. It's just important that I serve

01:42:12.479 --> 01:42:19.039
him wholeheartedly where he wants me to be. We certainly appreciate these expressions that you've

01:42:19.039 --> 01:42:25.920
shared with us. But now let's come forward to Gilead. How has it helped and assisted you to

01:42:25.920 --> 01:42:34.640
continue being available for full-time service? Asnolia? Spending five months of deep Bible study

01:42:34.640 --> 01:42:41.119
has reviewed areas in my service that I need to work on, especially on the wise use of time.

01:42:41.840 --> 01:42:48.159
Before coming to Gilead, I used to feel that I had very limited time for deep personal Bible study

01:42:48.159 --> 01:42:53.279
and meditation, especially after waking for the whole day. For example, Mondays,

01:42:53.920 --> 01:43:00.800
after Monday night was our study, for me that was it. I thought I'm so tired, I don't think I can

01:43:00.800 --> 01:43:07.439
study anything else. But the training at Gilead has actually helped me to see that I can do much more

01:43:08.079 --> 01:43:15.199
because when we finish the Monday, the washed our study, we go back to the rooms. What do we do? We

01:43:15.199 --> 01:43:23.680
study for an hour, two hours, sometimes three hours. So it's the same thing even for midweek meetings,

01:43:23.680 --> 01:43:30.239
for example, Wednesday. Before coming to Gilead, I used to feel that I prepared for the meetings

01:43:30.239 --> 01:43:35.680
and I've worked for the whole day. Now I am back from the meetings. I don't think I'll study

01:43:35.680 --> 01:43:42.159
anything else. But the training here has helped me to see that I can still study something

01:43:42.159 --> 01:43:46.960
because that's what we do. When we come back from the meetings, when Wednesday evening,

01:43:46.960 --> 01:43:55.600
we study for an hour or more. So I can say the training has pushed my limits far beyond what I

01:43:55.600 --> 01:44:01.279
thought I could do. So as a result, the quality of my relationship with Jehovah has improved.

01:44:02.239 --> 01:44:06.399
Thank you. You caused all of us to stop and think about our own schedules.

01:44:07.199 --> 01:44:11.520
And Camila, I believe there are a couple areas where you've benefited.

01:44:12.159 --> 01:44:18.560
Yeah, I learned that it was because I obeyed Jehovah that I'm happy today because when we obeyed

01:44:18.560 --> 01:44:25.520
Jehovah, Jehovah blesses us with joy. And before Gilead, for example, I had this wrong idea that

01:44:25.600 --> 01:44:32.479
my joy was based on shifting circumstances. So for example, I would think I will be happy if this

01:44:32.479 --> 01:44:38.800
and this happens to me. But this is not where our joy comes from. We just need to obey Jehovah

01:44:38.800 --> 01:44:46.159
and become his friend. And it's not about being used by him either because Jehovah can use

01:44:46.159 --> 01:44:52.800
anybody. As we've learned in our studies, he used Cyrus, Nebuchadnezzar, and some Roman

01:44:52.800 --> 01:44:59.199
emperors, but they were not his friends. So being Jehovah's friend is really our biggest privilege.

01:44:59.920 --> 01:45:05.840
And of course, here at Gilead, I've had also situations where I had to obey Jehovah because I'm Danish.

01:45:06.880 --> 01:45:14.720
And as a Dane, we are not as social people as maybe people from the warmer countries like Italy.

01:45:15.439 --> 01:45:24.079
Before Gilead, I would keep my social life at a level where I could handle it. But here at Bethel

01:45:24.079 --> 01:45:31.119
and at Gilead, I have people all around me all the time. So I had been thinking, oh, I can't do

01:45:31.119 --> 01:45:36.239
this, I can't do this, but I started to change my thinking. And I said to myself, I can do this

01:45:36.239 --> 01:45:43.039
which Jehovah's help. And now after I've been here for five months, I love having people around me.

01:45:43.119 --> 01:45:46.239
And I find that I'm very social. So it's like being a new person.

01:45:48.319 --> 01:45:53.039
Thank you. And Dennis, what benefits have you reflected upon?

01:45:53.760 --> 01:45:57.279
I feel I've learned to face challenges and problems more in Jehovah's way.

01:45:58.399 --> 01:46:05.119
During the school, I have these aha moments where a light ball went on and I recognize some of the

01:46:05.119 --> 01:46:11.439
situations that we discussed as situations that I had faced before, but I didn't deal with in the

01:46:11.520 --> 01:46:18.479
best way. One example of this was before Gilead, many times when I didn't have a lot of results in

01:46:18.479 --> 01:46:24.319
my service, I could get very discouraged. And the problem was that I focused way too much on

01:46:24.319 --> 01:46:29.600
results. Of course, I knew that Jehovah doesn't view it this way, but I couldn't really get my

01:46:29.600 --> 01:46:36.640
attitude changed. But then during Gilead, we have discussed this subject time and again. And

01:46:36.720 --> 01:46:43.520
this has really changed my attitude to this subject. One scripture that really made a big

01:46:43.520 --> 01:46:51.439
big impression on me was Sikharaya, or Sifanaya 317, because it says that Jehovah shouts with joy

01:46:51.439 --> 01:46:58.880
over us when we do his will. And the application was for the service. And the application was that he

01:46:58.880 --> 01:47:05.840
also shouts with joy when we in service, no matter what the results are. So if I'm in service and the

01:47:05.840 --> 01:47:11.199
results aren't great, I should remember that Jehovah is shouting with joy because I'm showing my

01:47:11.199 --> 01:47:17.279
love to him. And I should do the same. I should be so happy that he's sitting there shouting with

01:47:17.279 --> 01:47:25.520
joy. Ererson, we're very interested in your comments. Going through Gilead for me was like having

01:47:25.520 --> 01:47:31.279
a hard-to-hard conversation with a loving father, receiving commendation, as well as encouragement

01:47:31.279 --> 01:47:39.039
to do well. We spent many hours looking closely at examples of faith, both in Bible times and

01:47:39.039 --> 01:47:44.800
in the modern-day history of Jehovah's people. And each one of those men and women were a success

01:47:44.800 --> 01:47:51.760
story, regardless of their circumstances in life. Abraham, for example, he went wherever Jehovah

01:47:51.760 --> 01:47:58.319
told him to go and he did whatever Jehovah asked him to do. But does that mean that his life was

01:47:58.319 --> 01:48:05.199
problem-free? No, he experienced heartache from things happening within his family, things that

01:48:05.199 --> 01:48:12.239
problems coming from outside his family, yet did Abraham ever doubt whether Jehovah was still supporting

01:48:12.239 --> 01:48:19.840
him or whether Jehovah would fulfill his promise to him? Hebrews chapter 6 and verse 15 says,

01:48:20.640 --> 01:48:29.760
After Abraham had shown patience, he received this promise. Patient endurance with faith.

01:48:30.479 --> 01:48:38.319
Gilead has really helped me to deeply appreciate these wonderful qualities. And with Jehovah's help,

01:48:38.319 --> 01:48:43.760
we want to make our life a success story just like that of Abraham and other faithful servants of

01:48:43.760 --> 01:48:50.960
Jehovah. And we know all four of you will as well as the other soon-to-be graduates of the 137th

01:48:50.960 --> 01:48:57.359
class. We pray Jehovah's blessing with you as you continue to make yourselves available for

01:48:57.359 --> 01:49:18.350
kingdom service. Well done, brother, knockies. And we certainly appreciate it here and from the

01:49:18.350 --> 01:49:26.350
couples that you interviewed. We now invite you to exercise your legs and vocal cords by standing

01:49:26.989 --> 01:49:38.750
and singing song number 94, content with God's good gifts based on James 117. That's song number 94.

01:49:38.750 --> 01:52:36.420
Please be seated. Our concluding talk on the program will be presented by brother Stephen

01:52:36.420 --> 01:52:44.100
Latin, member of the governing body. So please give your attention to this invitation. Observe

01:52:44.100 --> 01:53:00.659
intently the birds of heaven. Have you ever found yourself amused or even amazed at an animal?

01:53:02.100 --> 01:53:08.420
Has an animal ever taught you anything? Well, probably you would answer those questions, yes.

01:53:09.539 --> 01:53:17.699
In fact, periodically, God's word encourages us to observe various plants, various animals,

01:53:18.420 --> 01:53:27.220
and learn various lessons from them. For example, at Job 127, it says, ask please the animals

01:53:28.180 --> 01:53:38.260
and they will instruct you. Proverbs 66, go to the ant, Eulazy one, observe its ways and become wise.

01:53:39.140 --> 01:53:46.100
One more example, Matthew 628, take a lesson from the lilies. Notice how they grow.

01:53:47.060 --> 01:53:54.340
Well, that's just a few examples. Now, during this discussion though, we're going to focus on a study

01:53:54.340 --> 01:54:02.340
of birds. In fact, at times in the scriptures, either directly or indirectly, we're encouraged

01:54:02.340 --> 01:54:08.420
to learn valuable lessons from birds. The Bible actually makes hundreds of references

01:54:09.220 --> 01:54:16.500
to either specific species or to bird kind in general. And if you think about it, a lot of these

01:54:16.500 --> 01:54:22.420
scriptures wouldn't even make any sense unless we were keen observers of the habits of these birds.

01:54:22.420 --> 01:54:30.100
For example, Isaiah 38, 14, King Hezekiah made this comment. He said, like the swift or the thrush,

01:54:31.060 --> 01:54:37.939
so I keep chirping. I keep cuing like the dove. That wouldn't make sense unless you knew something

01:54:37.939 --> 01:54:47.539
about those types of birds. Or the psalmist at Psalm 102, 6 and 7. He says, I resemble the pelican

01:54:47.539 --> 01:54:55.699
of the wilderness. I'm like a little owl among the ruins. I lie awake. I'm like a solitary bird

01:54:55.699 --> 01:55:03.699
on a roof. As you know, Jehovah himself at times is likened to a bird. For example, in

01:55:04.579 --> 01:55:13.220
Deuteronomy chapter 32, Psalm 91, he's likened to an eagle. Or what about Isaiah 31, 5? It says,

01:55:13.220 --> 01:55:24.020
like swooping birds, so Jehovah of armies will defend Jerusalem. Sometimes the Bible outright

01:55:24.020 --> 01:55:32.659
tells us to pay attention to observed birds learn valuable lessons. For example, open up to Luke

01:55:32.659 --> 01:55:40.979
chapter 12, please. And notice what Jesus tells us here in this scripture. Luke chapter 12.

01:55:42.739 --> 01:55:53.710
And please, let's take a look at verse 24. Here Jesus says, consider the ravens. They neither

01:55:53.710 --> 01:56:03.630
so see nor reap. They have neither barn nor storehouse. Yet God feeds them. Are you not worth

01:56:03.630 --> 01:56:10.430
much more than birds? Well, those at first word consider. That's really a command, isn't it?

01:56:11.069 --> 01:56:19.149
It means to observe them, scrutinize, take notice of them. Go to Matthew chapter 6. Now here's

01:56:19.149 --> 01:56:26.029
our theme scripture for this talk. A very similar scripture. But notice what Jesus advises in this

01:56:26.029 --> 01:56:36.430
scripture. Matthew chapter 6, verse 26, he says, observe intently the birds of heaven. They do not

01:56:36.430 --> 01:56:45.310
so see or reap or gather into storehouses. Yet your heavenly father feeds them. Are you not worth

01:56:45.310 --> 01:56:54.750
more than they are? Well, interesting, isn't it? It's a beautiful illustration about how precious

01:56:54.750 --> 01:57:00.430
God's people are to Him. And that's certainly as true of you dear Gilea students, how precious.

01:57:00.430 --> 01:57:07.470
And we never need be anxious about how we're going to obtain life's necessities. But notice those

01:57:07.470 --> 01:57:14.670
first two words there, observe intently. That means more than just a casual glance, does it? It means

01:57:14.670 --> 01:57:22.670
to inspect closely to scrutinize carefully. And that's really what Jesus is saying here in this

01:57:22.670 --> 01:57:29.470
scripture. Let's go to a Job chapter 12, please. We touched on this verse, but not going to read it

01:57:29.470 --> 01:57:38.399
in this entirety. And very interesting what we're told here. Job 12, verse 7, your Job says,

01:57:39.199 --> 01:57:47.840
however, ask please the animals and they will instruct you. Also the birds of the heavens

01:57:48.880 --> 01:57:57.520
and they will tell you. So here under inspiration, Job is saying now, ask a bird and it will tell you.

01:57:58.239 --> 01:58:04.319
Obviously you can't literally ask a bird a question and have it given intelligent answer.

01:58:04.560 --> 01:58:14.800
This asking and telling obviously is figurative, isn't it? See, you ask by studying that bird carefully.

01:58:15.520 --> 01:58:22.640
They tell by the lessons imparted to you as a result of that. Now, one specific type of bird

01:58:23.199 --> 01:58:27.520
that we're going to talk about basically for the rest of our discussion, that we can ask

01:58:28.479 --> 01:58:36.079
and have it tell us many valuable lessons is the geese. Now, we're going to talk about the geese. In

01:58:36.079 --> 01:58:42.640
fact, we're going to identify and discuss briefly seven lessons to be learned. And we really feel

01:58:42.640 --> 01:58:48.319
these lessons will be valuable for you dear Gilead students soon to be graduates. In fact,

01:58:48.319 --> 01:58:57.760
for all of us, we can get these seven lessons. Now, lesson number one, as Jehovah feeds the geese,

01:58:58.960 --> 01:59:05.600
he will definitely provide for you. In fact, that was a point Jesus made, wasn't it? Jehovah feeds

01:59:05.600 --> 01:59:10.159
the birds. Now, it's true, they don't plant, they don't cultivate, they don't gather into a barn.

01:59:11.520 --> 01:59:16.800
Geese couldn't even do that if they had the capability to do it because they don't stay in one spot.

01:59:17.760 --> 01:59:23.920
They migrate, they move, but yet Jehovah feeds them all along the way, doesn't he? They will descend

01:59:24.960 --> 01:59:33.359
to a pond, a field, they will dine on food and drink, and then they continue their journey.

01:59:33.359 --> 01:59:41.279
And what did Jesus say? Remember what he said? In Matthew 626, you're worth more than birds.

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:47.119
All right, like even better, what Jesus said in Luke 1224, we read earlier, he said,

01:59:47.119 --> 01:59:54.800
you are worth much more than birds. I like that extra word that's slapped in there and that to

01:59:54.800 --> 02:00:00.159
scripture. So you're worth much more than birds. Jehovah does this for the birds, he's certainly

02:00:00.159 --> 02:00:06.720
going to take care of you. So never doubt for a moment the promise of Jehovah through Jesus

02:00:07.359 --> 02:00:12.560
that if you seek first the kingdom and that's what you're doing. See, you're spending your whole

02:00:12.560 --> 02:00:18.159
life in doing that, that Jehovah is certainly going to provide for you. These other things

02:00:19.199 --> 02:00:25.760
will be added to you. And that would be the food, drink, clothing, shelter, these things we need.

02:00:25.760 --> 02:00:33.840
We'll be added. Scripture didn't say, maybe good chance probably. We'll be 100% guaranteed

02:00:33.840 --> 02:00:42.479
no chance for it not to happen. In fact, open up to 1 Timothy chapter 5 and let's get an interesting

02:00:42.479 --> 02:00:47.119
extended application of this familiar scripture. And I think it'll even give you a more conviction

02:00:48.079 --> 02:00:54.720
Jehovah is certainly going to take care of you in every way. 1 Timothy chapter 5, please,

02:00:54.720 --> 02:01:00.880
and let's read verse 8. It says, certainly, if anyone does not provide for those who are

02:01:00.880 --> 02:01:10.720
his own and especially for those who are members of his household, he has disowned the faith and is

02:01:10.720 --> 02:01:18.239
worse than a person without faith. Now, we know how we normally apply this. See, a father who doesn't

02:01:18.239 --> 02:01:24.000
take care of his household members, he's worse than a man without faith. One translation says,

02:01:24.079 --> 02:01:30.399
worse than an atheist. Now, that's pretty bad, isn't it? But have you ever thought of applying this

02:01:30.399 --> 02:01:39.600
scripture to Jehovah in an extended application? Is he not our father? Are we not members of his

02:01:39.600 --> 02:01:46.800
household? In fact, in 1 Timothy 315, it refers to us as being in God's household. We ought to know

02:01:46.800 --> 02:01:51.520
how to conduct ourselves in God's household. Now, do you think Jehovah is not going to take care

02:01:51.520 --> 02:01:57.840
of members of his household? I mean, this scripture we just read would actually be self-condimming

02:01:57.840 --> 02:02:03.039
of Jehovah. See, he inspired the Apostle Paul to write this scripture, make it part of his holy

02:02:03.039 --> 02:02:10.640
word. If he didn't apply it to himself in principle, this scripture would be self-condimming of Jehovah.

02:02:10.640 --> 02:02:17.199
Never could that happen. Never has that happened as song number 60 in our songbook. It says,

02:02:17.199 --> 02:02:25.840
he will not fail to care for all his own. And he has a perfect record, doesn't he? A perfect

02:02:25.840 --> 02:02:32.640
record of doing that so never question this. But of course, we have to do our part. Now again,

02:02:32.640 --> 02:02:38.960
if you think about the geese, it's true, Jehovah feeds the geese, but does he airlift the food to

02:02:38.960 --> 02:02:46.640
them in mid-flight? No, they have to go down, they have to search for food, they have to fly back

02:02:46.720 --> 02:02:53.359
up to the proper altitude, they have to resume their V formation and they have to continue their

02:02:53.359 --> 02:02:58.079
journey. A lot of hard work, isn't it? But they do their part, Jehovah certainly does his. You

02:02:58.079 --> 02:03:03.600
seek first the kingdom, then Jehovah is certainly going to actually do more than his part.

02:03:04.239 --> 02:03:08.800
That's always the case, isn't it? What does that mean? Well, he's going to always provide all your

02:03:08.800 --> 02:03:14.880
true needs, but actually he will provide some of your wants. That's how generous Jehovah is. Maybe

02:03:14.960 --> 02:03:21.600
not all your wants, because then would be spoiled children, wouldn't we? And Jehovah doesn't want

02:03:21.600 --> 02:03:28.800
spoiled children, see? We don't want to be a spoiled child. But he's so generous, not only

02:03:28.800 --> 02:03:33.920
all your true needs, but even some of your wants. Well, let's get our second lesson.

02:03:35.359 --> 02:03:44.319
As geese must fly in formation, you must always treasure and stay in your place in Jehovah's

02:03:44.399 --> 02:03:50.960
organization. Now scientists have determined that the V formation serves two very important

02:03:50.960 --> 02:03:58.319
purposes. First, it can serve their energy. Second, it enables the geese to keep track of every

02:03:58.319 --> 02:04:08.399
bird in the group and respond quickly if the birds in the front change direction, speed or altitude.

02:04:08.479 --> 02:04:16.880
See, they can respond very easily with that V formation. So they're able to not only migrate,

02:04:16.880 --> 02:04:22.399
but they stay in formation and they help each other that way. Now, there might be an individual

02:04:22.399 --> 02:04:32.000
geese who would prefer relaxing on some warm beach rather than exerting himself vigorously in this

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:37.920
cold high altitude, but to leave his place in that formation. That could be disastrous, couldn't.

02:04:38.720 --> 02:04:44.640
Well, the same with you. You must treasure your place, stay in your place. Now, how do you do this?

02:04:45.359 --> 02:04:50.800
Well, the watchtower sometime ago said two things are important. Of course, being obedient,

02:04:51.439 --> 02:04:58.880
submissive to theocratic direction, but also staying busy in Jehovah's service. And there's two ways

02:04:59.840 --> 02:05:07.439
we show that we are cherishing our place in Jehovah's organization. It's true, sometimes you may

02:05:07.439 --> 02:05:14.880
think that direction coming from the organization will not work as well as maybe a personal idea you

02:05:14.880 --> 02:05:28.340
have, but then you remember that personal idea hadn't been approved. And as we said, Jehovah blesses

02:05:28.340 --> 02:05:34.100
obedience. If we think about ones who didn't cherish their place in Jehovah's organization,

02:05:34.100 --> 02:05:40.180
you might think of Satan, of course, the demons, Azaya, King Saul, modern day apostates.

02:05:41.220 --> 02:05:47.539
Now, they forfeited many blessings first and foremost, Jehovah's favor for not appreciating their

02:05:47.539 --> 02:05:55.539
place in Jehovah's organization. In contrast, Jesus, for billions of years, he's appreciated his

02:05:55.539 --> 02:06:03.300
place, hasn't he? So by being obedient, staying busy, then we are not only flying. You could say

02:06:03.300 --> 02:06:10.979
we're flying in formation. Now, here's the third lesson we can get. As geese and flight often

02:06:10.979 --> 02:06:18.420
hawk to encourage each other to keep going, you must be alert to encourage your brothers to keep

02:06:18.420 --> 02:06:24.180
going. Now, let's talk about this for a moment. Apparently, according to ornithologists, they

02:06:24.180 --> 02:06:31.140
hawk for several reasons, but one reason is to encourage those in the front to keep up their speed.

02:06:32.180 --> 02:06:39.140
And actually what happens if the lead goose tires, he'll drop back in formation and that leaves

02:06:39.779 --> 02:06:46.420
other geese in the front. See, and then now he's hawking to encourage them. So we take turns,

02:06:46.420 --> 02:06:53.060
don't we? And encouraging each other to keep going, keep up our speed, don't give up, move ahead.

02:06:54.420 --> 02:06:59.380
Like manner, there are many ways we can do that. See, we can do that by our expressions before and

02:06:59.380 --> 02:07:07.779
after the meetings. We can do that by our comments during the meeting, our well-prepared talks during

02:07:07.779 --> 02:07:13.859
the meeting, even our singing. Even though we may think our singing is not that melodious at times,

02:07:13.859 --> 02:07:21.329
but more like that hawk we were talking about. But these are just examples of how we encourage

02:07:22.050 --> 02:07:28.529
our brothers. Well, let's get a fourth lesson to be learned. And this is quite touching to

02:07:28.529 --> 02:07:35.729
think about, according to eyewitnesses, if a goose tires and has to actually land,

02:07:36.930 --> 02:07:43.170
observers have seen that two other geese go down with that one and stay with support,

02:07:43.170 --> 02:07:49.970
protect that one until he's able to return to the flock. Well, similarly, you have deep affection

02:07:49.970 --> 02:07:55.970
for your brothers and sisters, and especially in time of need. See, in time of need, say,

02:07:55.970 --> 02:08:01.329
you're going to rally to support and protect these ones. If you notice a brother or sister,

02:08:01.329 --> 02:08:07.569
and this includes others in special full-time service, if you notice someone who's wounded,

02:08:08.289 --> 02:08:17.170
or sick, some way physically, emotionally, we know you're going to take the time to provide

02:08:17.170 --> 02:08:21.970
practical assistance to help this one. In fact, we want to commend you in advance. We know you're

02:08:21.970 --> 02:08:28.289
going to do that. See, you're going to support and rally and help these ones. It was a very interesting

02:08:28.289 --> 02:08:35.810
experience in the watchtower. This was the August 15, 2005 watchtower talking about supporting

02:08:35.810 --> 02:08:42.130
our brothers in time of need. But it was about a missionary and synagogue who studied with a young

02:08:42.130 --> 02:08:50.210
woman, and that young woman had contracted HIV from her unbelieving husband. Well, after her

02:08:50.210 --> 02:08:57.810
husband died, the sister was baptized, and she became our sister. But shortly after that,

02:08:57.810 --> 02:09:04.369
her health failed, and she was hospitalized with AIDS. Well, the missionary sister stated,

02:09:04.369 --> 02:09:11.250
the hospital staff did their best, but they were few and number. So volunteers from the congregation

02:09:11.329 --> 02:09:16.850
supplemented what the hospital staff could do. But the sister, herself, the missionary sister,

02:09:17.489 --> 02:09:23.890
said at times she even slept on a mat beside the bed of this new sister and helped to take care of

02:09:23.890 --> 02:09:32.850
her until she died. Now, the hospital doctor in charge, he couldn't believe it. He said, I can't

02:09:32.850 --> 02:09:38.289
understand this. Here you are. You're not even related to this person. You're not even from the

02:09:38.369 --> 02:09:47.170
same country. You're not even the same color. And yet, here you risk yourself to help this person.

02:09:47.170 --> 02:09:55.329
Why? Well, the sister explained that this is my sister. I love her. We're as close as if we had

02:09:55.329 --> 02:10:01.729
the same mother and father. What a tremendous witness was given. And a watchtower ended up by saying

02:10:01.729 --> 02:10:07.890
incidentally, there were no ill effects suffered by that missionary sister as a result of her loving

02:10:07.890 --> 02:10:15.729
care of that new sister. Well, let's get our fifth lesson. When geese notice something strange,

02:10:16.689 --> 02:10:24.130
you know what they do? They sound the warning. Similarly, we know that you're going to be alert

02:10:24.130 --> 02:10:29.010
to sound the warning when appropriate. Let's talk about this. The awake had a little article

02:10:29.010 --> 02:10:36.930
watching the world entitled guard geese. And it talked about how the US Army, quote, recruited

02:10:37.810 --> 02:10:44.609
a gaggle of 900 geese to watch their communications radar and air defense equipment was located in

02:10:44.609 --> 02:10:51.649
Germany. The spokesman for the command said, whenever geese notice something strange, they make a

02:10:51.649 --> 02:10:59.890
lot of noise. And it's true. They have acute hearing. And if they notice something strange,

02:10:59.890 --> 02:11:07.409
they make a lot of noise by hissing, honking, and flapping their wings. Well, similarly, like manner,

02:11:08.130 --> 02:11:15.649
if you notice problems looming in the congregation, we know you're going to, in a spirit of

02:11:15.649 --> 02:11:20.609
mildness, you're going to sound the warning. You're going to try to help. If you see, as mentioned

02:11:20.609 --> 02:11:27.890
in Galatians 6.1, that a brother or sister has taken a false step before they're even aware of it.

02:11:28.770 --> 02:11:32.930
In a spirit of mildness, you're going to try to readjust that one. And quickly, because you notice

02:11:32.930 --> 02:11:41.329
the scripture said, if they take a false step, it didn't say steps. It didn't say a false path,

02:11:42.289 --> 02:11:46.770
a false step. They're not even aware of it. You try to readjust them in a spirit of mildness.

02:11:47.409 --> 02:11:54.130
Similarly, in the territory, we know that you're going to sound the warning loudly concerning

02:11:54.130 --> 02:12:00.369
Jehovah's coming day. And in fact, it's urgent for all of us to do this, isn't it? Because in a fact,

02:12:00.850 --> 02:12:07.170
you could say the sword of Armageddon has already cast a shadow, hasn't it? So we want to sound

02:12:07.250 --> 02:12:13.649
the warning. Well, lesson number six. As geese can fly over very high mountains to reach their

02:12:13.649 --> 02:12:20.770
destination, you must be able to overcome even lofty obstacles with Jehovah's help.

02:12:21.810 --> 02:12:28.289
Sometimes even it looks like they're insurmountable. But with Jehovah's help, you can do it.

02:12:28.289 --> 02:12:34.449
They awake, again, talked about geese some years ago. It said, possibly the greatest known recorded

02:12:34.449 --> 02:12:40.850
height attained by birds in flight was that achieved some years ago by a flock of geese and

02:12:40.850 --> 02:12:48.930
migration across the lofty Himalayas. All that, or at that time, the week says, scientists were

02:12:48.930 --> 02:12:56.609
photographing the sun over India when they saw these geese flying in the formation at the height

02:12:56.609 --> 02:13:04.050
of Mount Everest, almost 29,000 feet high. Amazing, isn't it? And then it was interesting that

02:13:04.050 --> 02:13:10.770
we ended up by saying, can these high flying geese even fly higher? If necessary, the wake said

02:13:10.770 --> 02:13:16.369
quite possibly they can. We really don't know how high they can go. Well, it's the same with us,

02:13:16.369 --> 02:13:25.729
isn't it? We can overcome anything with Jehovah's help. See, if we rely on Him, as Isaiah 4031 says,

02:13:25.729 --> 02:13:32.529
we can soar on wings like eagles, or adaptor for this talk, we can soar on wings like geese.

02:13:33.729 --> 02:13:39.810
See, you can do it with Jehovah's help. Matthew 1720, Jesus said, with enough faith,

02:13:40.689 --> 02:13:46.930
you can even transfer mountains. And we heard experiences on this program, didn't we? Of ones that

02:13:46.930 --> 02:13:54.850
overcome different obstacles, even apparently insurmountable obstacles with Jehovah's help.

02:13:54.850 --> 02:14:00.210
Now, one more lesson we want to get here number seven, as geese are monogamous,

02:14:01.329 --> 02:14:09.729
you dear Gileus students who are married must remain strictly loyal to your mates. And it's

02:14:09.729 --> 02:14:16.050
true, geese have one mate for life. According to ornithologists, if one of the pair dies,

02:14:16.050 --> 02:14:21.890
the surviving goose might accept another mate, but usually they remain single. Well, very interesting,

02:14:21.890 --> 02:14:28.770
isn't it? Characteristic of this creation of Jehovah. Well, in like manner, you 23 married couples

02:14:29.729 --> 02:14:37.569
in our class. You are faithful. You are loyal to your mates. And we know you're going to continue

02:14:37.569 --> 02:14:43.649
that way, and we commend you also for this. In fact, all 48 of you in the class are sterling

02:14:43.649 --> 02:14:51.569
examples in loyalty, which is an essential quality for any Christian, especially a graduate

02:14:51.569 --> 02:14:58.369
of Gileus. Micah 6, 8. Remember what the question is asked there? What is Jehovah requiring of you?

02:14:59.250 --> 02:15:06.689
And then among the things listed to cherish loyalty. And that means more than just be loyal out

02:15:06.689 --> 02:15:14.850
of sense of duty, or under compulsion, say, it means to relish, to highly value,

02:15:15.970 --> 02:15:22.210
to cherish, see, it's more than just doing it because you have to do it. You love this quality,

02:15:22.210 --> 02:15:28.529
see? And we know you're going to continue as loyal servants of Jehovah. So there we have seven

02:15:28.529 --> 02:15:36.289
valuable lessons from this, just one creation of Jehovah God, just in quick review, as Jehovah feeds

02:15:36.289 --> 02:15:43.649
the geese. Never doubt. He's going to fully take care of you. You're worth a whole lot more than

02:15:43.649 --> 02:15:51.010
birds. Number two is geese must stay in formation. You must cherish and stay in your place

02:15:51.649 --> 02:15:57.729
in Jehovah's organization. Three, as geese often hawk to encourage each other to keep going,

02:15:58.770 --> 02:16:05.090
you must be alert to encourage your brothers not to give up to keep going. Number four,

02:16:05.890 --> 02:16:12.770
touchingly, if one goose has to land, two, have been observed to go down and stay with that one

02:16:12.770 --> 02:16:18.689
until he can return to the flock. So be alert because of your affection for your brothers to support,

02:16:18.689 --> 02:16:26.289
protect, especially in time of need. Five, as geese sound a warning when they notice something strange,

02:16:27.329 --> 02:16:32.770
be sure to sound that warning, but with a spirit of mildness in the congregation,

02:16:33.569 --> 02:16:40.930
and especially in your territory. And number six, as geese can fly over very high mountains,

02:16:40.930 --> 02:16:49.969
get to their destination, you can overcome any obstacle with Jehovah's help. And number seven,

02:16:49.969 --> 02:16:56.770
our last one, as geese or monogamous, you must be strictly loyal to your mates.

02:16:57.969 --> 02:17:00.930
Well, I'm sure if you made a study of geese, you'd come up with some more lessons.

02:17:01.170 --> 02:17:08.450
More, in addition to these seven, we've discussed see. And these kind of lessons can make us wise,

02:17:08.450 --> 02:17:16.049
can't they? Open up to Job, chapter 35, and notice what a lie he under inspiration had to say about

02:17:16.049 --> 02:17:26.020
this. Job 35, please, verse number 11, here a lie he starts out, he says, he, Jehovah,

02:17:26.500 --> 02:17:36.659
teaches us more than the beast of the earth. And notice this, he makes us wiser than the birds of

02:17:36.659 --> 02:17:44.260
the heavens. And it's really true. See, this quote, wisdom of the birds is because of really,

02:17:44.260 --> 02:17:51.860
they're being instinctively wise, Proverbs 30, verse 24. But see, your wisdom is a result of

02:17:52.659 --> 02:18:01.780
prayerful effort, Jehovah's blessing on that effort. At Matthew 626, when Jesus said to observe

02:18:01.780 --> 02:18:06.739
intently the birds of heaven, he didn't specify what type of bird did he? I mean, you can make a

02:18:06.739 --> 02:18:15.860
study of stork, swallows, pelicans, peacocks, eagles. What about a woodpecker? Did you know a

02:18:15.860 --> 02:18:19.860
woodpecker can strike his head 22 times a second on solid wood, not even get a headache?

02:18:22.180 --> 02:18:31.870
You've got to be some valuable lessons to learn from the woodpecker. And then think about other

02:18:31.870 --> 02:18:39.069
types of animals. You could make a study of all other types of animals that Jehovah's made,

02:18:39.069 --> 02:18:42.670
and you could learn valuable lessons from them. And in the new world, you'll have plenty of time

02:18:42.670 --> 02:18:49.309
to do that, won't you? You'll have plenty of time to study Jehovah's creation, learn these lessons.

02:18:49.309 --> 02:18:56.909
But in the meantime, let's, in imitation of geese, let's continue to cherish our place in

02:18:56.909 --> 02:19:06.750
Jehovah's organization and encourage each other to keep going as we continue our migration from

02:19:06.750 --> 02:19:13.469
this old system of things to the new world, that new world comprised of the new heavens and new

02:19:14.190 --> 02:20:25.540
earth in which perfect righteousness will dwell. When I was behind the curtain, I was beginning to

02:20:25.540 --> 02:20:30.020
get an attitude because you didn't applaud like that. For me, I thought you were applauding for

02:20:30.020 --> 02:20:42.700
brother let. What an outstanding talk brother let gave us. When I grow up, I'm going to give a

02:20:42.700 --> 02:20:56.670
talk just like that. Now we have some greetings from near and far. We're not going to read everything

02:20:56.750 --> 02:21:02.510
they said, but just tell you that they love you very much. And here they are, Bolivia,

02:21:04.430 --> 02:21:12.590
Brazil. By the way, we had first missionary couple in 46 years present, Bulgaria,

02:21:14.030 --> 02:21:23.549
one couple, one single brother, Central America, Central Europe, Chile, France, Georgia, Haiti,

02:21:24.190 --> 02:21:36.750
Japan, Kenya, Korea, and not just the brothers there at the branch, but also 600 of your brothers

02:21:36.750 --> 02:21:46.620
in prisons and their 11 greetings to you. Malawi and Myanmar, we have two couples from Myanmar here

02:21:46.620 --> 02:21:58.540
in the class, Netherlands, Sierra Leone, Slovakia. That's quite a few that are interested in what's

02:21:58.540 --> 02:22:27.819
going on here. Now we would like to introduce to you the 137th class of Gilead. The time has arrived

02:22:27.819 --> 02:22:35.500
now for us to present diplomas to these beautiful brothers and sisters and to assist me we have

02:22:35.500 --> 02:22:43.340
brother Kenneth Flodina, a helper to the teaching committee. And he does such a good job that we're

02:22:43.340 --> 02:22:53.120
going to let him name these people and the country they're from and where they're going.

02:22:54.879 --> 02:23:07.170
He's really a helper. A couple is Isak and Ruth Asava from Ethiopia and they're returning to

02:23:07.170 --> 02:23:24.909
Ethiopia. And next we have Yaddi Binov from the Slovak Republic. He's being assigned to Bulgaria.

02:23:33.329 --> 02:23:37.729
And this is Orlando and Jessica Cardoso from Angola returning to Angola.

02:23:46.350 --> 02:24:04.030
Jinho and Suyong Chang from Taiwan returning to Taiwan. And this is Oliak and Juliana Chuprina from

02:24:04.030 --> 02:24:19.280
Russia going back to Russia. This is a David and Esther Dantin from Belgium returning to Belgium.

02:24:28.129 --> 02:24:42.979
Robert and Luba Delahi from Georgia, the country of Georgia, back to Georgia. We have now Seth

02:24:42.979 --> 02:24:57.620
and Gina Fleming from Hong Kong and they're being assigned to South Korea. Jerry and Doris

02:24:57.620 --> 02:25:11.120
Florencia from Papua New Guinea returning to Papua New Guinea. And this is Gorigey and Maria

02:25:11.120 --> 02:25:27.250
Gogovi from Bulgaria returning to Bulgaria. We have with us here Duane and Amber Heaton. They're from

02:25:27.250 --> 02:25:30.530
Canada and they're going to receive a special assignment in a foreign country.

02:25:40.159 --> 02:25:57.840
Hajima and Aki Hariday from Japan being assigned to Myanmar. Sai and Nunu, Alwa from Myanmar returning to

02:25:57.840 --> 02:26:14.799
Myanmar. Now we have with us Lovemore and Vim Bai Jumbaya from Zimbabwe returning to Zimbabwe.

02:26:23.739 --> 02:26:28.379
Desmond and Amelia Jones from Sierra Leone returning to Sierra Leone.

02:26:37.010 --> 02:26:51.700
Sifis and Carol Kalinda from Zambia returning to Zambia. This is Daniel and Yustena Kauswish from

02:26:51.700 --> 02:27:18.799
Poland returning to Poland. This is Jocamo Mfei from Italy being assigned to Colombia. Who was that?

02:27:23.200 --> 02:27:37.620
This is Harrison and Snolia Miseko from Malawi going back to Malawi. Dennis and Kamilia

02:27:37.620 --> 02:27:41.700
Mielsen from Italy and they're going to receive a special assignment in a foreign country.

02:27:51.250 --> 02:27:57.569
This is Simone and Serena Seman from Canada. They too will receive a special assignment in a foreign

02:27:57.569 --> 02:28:21.520
country. Now we have with us Karim and Nadia Ciseber from Germany returning to Germany. Dalton

02:28:22.639 --> 02:28:38.180
and Erica Timura from Brazil returning to Brazil. Michael and Edwina Van Ling from Netherlands returning

02:28:38.180 --> 02:29:21.389
to the Netherlands. Asatra and Seraa Visasuk from Thailand returning to Thailand. It's a beautiful

02:29:21.389 --> 02:29:34.559
class isn't it? Beautiful. Begods people. Go on with the brotherhood. Now we're going to invite brother

02:29:34.559 --> 02:29:50.319
Orlando Cardosa from Angola and he's going to read a letter from the class to the governing body

02:29:50.319 --> 02:29:58.319
and to the Bethel family. Dear brothers and sisters. A joke chapter 36 verse 22 reread,

02:29:59.120 --> 02:30:07.760
look, God is exalted in His power. What instructor is like Him? These words hold the dear place in

02:30:07.760 --> 02:30:15.040
our hearts. For the last five months we have seen with our own eyes how Jehovah is the best

02:30:15.120 --> 02:30:22.239
educator. His instruction comes from many sources which includes you, our dear governing body and you

02:30:22.239 --> 02:30:30.079
the Bethel family. We will forever thank Jehovah for the training you have imparted to us.

02:30:31.600 --> 02:30:37.680
The living example of the governing body, your humility and modesty and conducting yourselves

02:30:37.680 --> 02:30:44.559
as lesser ones has shown us that Jehovah is the one driving the chariot. And as you have repeatedly

02:30:44.559 --> 02:30:52.159
told us in class, Jehovah is absolutely in charge of the organization. Your example reminds

02:30:52.159 --> 02:31:00.239
us to direct all attention to Jehovah. You continually pour yourselves out as a drink offering

02:31:00.239 --> 02:31:05.760
in behalf of Jehovah's people, earth-wide and still you lovingly set aside time to teach us

02:31:05.760 --> 02:31:14.719
personally. For your limitless love and sterling example will be forever grateful. We will never

02:31:14.719 --> 02:31:20.479
stop praying for you that Jehovah continues to strengthen you in your work as the faithful and

02:31:20.479 --> 02:31:28.479
discreet slave. Our new friends here at Bethel have shared in instructing us as well. Your deep

02:31:28.479 --> 02:31:35.360
personal interest in each one of us has not gone unnoticed. We were so nervous but from the day we

02:31:35.360 --> 02:31:42.079
arrived you welcomed us into your family with open arms. Yes, we slowed you down in the food lines,

02:31:42.719 --> 02:31:49.600
in the hallways and in the commissary, but you always met us with a warm smile reassuring us

02:31:49.600 --> 02:31:56.479
of your love. Thank you for not only providing us with delicious meals, clean rooms and clothing,

02:31:57.040 --> 02:32:00.479
but teaching us how to sew on buttons and remove stains from our ties.

02:32:00.559 --> 02:32:08.000
And what a blessing to be here during the international convention season. To witness your love and

02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:15.760
hospitality for the worldwide brotherhood. What an example you are to imitate. We will always

02:32:15.760 --> 02:32:23.600
have fond memories of our time with you. Our instructors are truly gifts in man.

02:32:24.159 --> 02:32:33.840
We were met each day with a hearty good morning, a warm smile, a thoughtful look and of course

02:32:33.840 --> 02:32:41.760
a written exercise. By putting meaning into and taking us on an in-depth study of the Bible,

02:32:42.559 --> 02:32:48.799
you have helped change who we are. The Bible is more alive than ever before.

02:32:48.879 --> 02:32:56.479
How we enjoyed learning to stop and think in terms of Bible principles, practical ways to put

02:32:56.479 --> 02:33:02.239
others ahead of ourselves and ways to imitate Christ by showing love to Jehovah's sheep.

02:33:04.000 --> 02:33:10.239
You prepared us to expect challenges in our assignments and when confronted with tests of faith,

02:33:11.200 --> 02:33:23.680
we will remember easy no possible yes with Jehovah's help. You freely shared with us your personal

02:33:23.680 --> 02:33:31.600
experiences and listened to ours. The time we shared with you will always be precious to us.

02:33:32.239 --> 02:33:39.520
We love you dear brothers. At Nehemiah chapter 2 verse 18, the Israelites responded to the

02:33:39.520 --> 02:33:45.840
encouragement and training they had received by decisively saying, let us get up and we must build.

02:33:47.280 --> 02:33:53.920
Through gildier training and to find example of the Bethel family, our hands have been strengthened

02:33:53.920 --> 02:34:00.399
to stabilize the modern day worlds of Jehovah's precious organization. Jehovah brought us here to make

02:34:00.399 --> 02:34:10.239
us strong, reliable and trustworthy for the work ahead. He has done his part. We are determined to

02:34:10.239 --> 02:34:16.959
do our part and allow our grand instructor to finish our training. Your brothers and sisters

02:34:16.959 --> 02:34:49.780
of the 137th class of Gilead. Certainly, I want to thank you, Brother Cardoso, for those thoughts

02:34:49.780 --> 02:34:58.579
of appreciation from this beautiful 137th class of Gilead. He has been a good,

02:34:58.579 --> 02:35:06.819
full and refreshing graduation of this class of Gilead. Our minds are bubbling over with enthusiasm,

02:35:07.940 --> 02:35:14.420
love for Jehovah and appreciation for all that he does for us every given day.

02:35:16.559 --> 02:35:26.000
Some of our thoughts may still be lying on just the surface of our minds. They have not penetrated

02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:35.600
very deep within, but they will in time if we work at it. So we encourage you Gilead students,

02:35:35.600 --> 02:35:45.040
especially to spike them down deep into your heart these thoughts of Jehovah. That takes repetition.

02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:53.200
It's not something that just takes one blow, but it may take several blows in order to get them

02:35:53.200 --> 02:35:58.479
down where you want them to be. It sort of reminds me when I was a young boy growing up,

02:35:59.360 --> 02:36:10.770
we lived near the railroad. We lived on the other side of the tracks. But I could see the railroad

02:36:10.770 --> 02:36:20.690
men working often, and they would be setting rails into the ties. They would have long spikes,

02:36:20.690 --> 02:36:28.450
and it would take two men with hammers. One would strike the head of the nail, the next man would

02:36:28.450 --> 02:36:35.170
strike the head of the nail, and it took several blows in order to get the nail fastened into the

02:36:35.170 --> 02:36:41.809
spike. If it was not fastened tightly and deep, while when the locomotives would come over,

02:36:41.809 --> 02:36:47.649
the rail, while then the rails would jump, and eventually the rail would fly off,

02:36:47.649 --> 02:36:53.729
and there would be a serious train wreck. Well, we don't want any serious thing to happen to our

02:36:53.729 --> 02:37:00.129
minds and hearts, but we want to make sure that we have the truth down deep within, and then the

02:37:00.129 --> 02:37:05.729
devil is not going to be able to remove it from us quickly. We'll be able to put up a hard

02:37:05.729 --> 02:37:11.409
fight for the faith. So we want you to think about these things that you've been learning for

02:37:11.409 --> 02:37:20.850
the past few weeks here at the Gilead School. Take the time to spike them down deep into your heart,

02:37:21.729 --> 02:37:26.530
and in order to remember the school, keep thinking about what you have learned

02:37:27.489 --> 02:37:39.940
and let's you forget. Keep spiking. Let God's thoughts occupy your mind daily. It's not just a

02:37:39.940 --> 02:37:45.860
one-time thing. You come to school, you go to your assignment, you forget what you've learned.

02:37:46.819 --> 02:37:53.940
No, you need what you've learned. We all need what we learn. So we have to keep meditating

02:37:54.020 --> 02:38:02.370
on these things regularly. Now this is a contrast with the people prior to the flood of Noah's

02:38:02.370 --> 02:38:11.090
Day. For instance in Genesis chapter 6, verse 5, we're reminded of them, it's not good for us,

02:38:11.809 --> 02:38:19.489
but it's a reminder. It says, every inclination of the thoughts of his heart was only bad all the time.

02:38:19.489 --> 02:38:29.090
Now that's the way it was prior to the flood, but we want our thoughts to be good, thoughts,

02:38:29.969 --> 02:38:36.209
not bad thoughts. Now we're not to conclude from this that bad thoughts will not enter the mind.

02:38:37.250 --> 02:38:42.930
As long as we're imperfect, surrounded by an imperfect world, we're going to have bad thoughts

02:38:42.930 --> 02:38:47.729
across the mind, but we have to push them out. Get rid of them right away. Don't let them

02:38:47.729 --> 02:38:56.700
linger and fester and destroy our spirituality with God. Don't think seriously about wrong thoughts.

02:38:57.420 --> 02:39:05.420
Remove them quickly. But the thoughts that come from God, we want to think seriously about them

02:39:06.139 --> 02:39:16.659
regularly. Now we can't say that all the thoughts are extremely bad thoughts that come in,

02:39:16.659 --> 02:39:22.979
even though they're not from God. Sometimes the thoughts are just human thoughts. They're not

02:39:22.979 --> 02:39:28.979
God's thoughts, and that's what he told us earlier on in Isaiah that his thoughts are much higher

02:39:28.979 --> 02:39:34.340
than our thoughts and his ways are much higher than our ways. So we can't to get around that,

02:39:35.620 --> 02:39:45.860
but we want to work hard at thinking in a righteous way. And we have an example here in the

02:39:45.860 --> 02:39:52.100
Bible. Now of course you students were not asked to bring your Bible up here. So just to sit there

02:39:52.100 --> 02:40:00.510
quietly and listen. This is Matthew chapter 16. Now this was read earlier by one of the brothers,

02:40:00.510 --> 02:40:06.510
and I thought then he's still in my thunder, but not really. He went off in a different

02:40:06.510 --> 02:40:16.510
to vain. I'm taking you. But here in Matthew chapter 16 verses 21, 22 and 23, it says from that

02:40:16.510 --> 02:40:23.309
time forward, Jesus began explaining to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many

02:40:23.309 --> 02:40:28.670
things from the elders and chief priests and scribes and be killed. And on the third day,

02:40:28.670 --> 02:40:35.870
he raised up. At this Peter took him aside and began to review him saying, be kind to yourself,

02:40:35.870 --> 02:40:43.629
Lord, you will not have this happen to you at all. But turning his back, he said to Peter,

02:40:44.590 --> 02:40:52.270
get behind me, Satan, you're a stumbling block to me because you think not God's thoughts,

02:40:53.149 --> 02:41:05.389
but those of men. Peter was not altogether bad. He was just off track a little bit,

02:41:05.469 --> 02:41:12.430
and Jesus had to set him straight. Jesus knew that he had to die. Peter didn't understand that

02:41:12.430 --> 02:41:22.190
clearly, but Jesus reminded him of that. That way he was thinking was not the way God wanted him to

02:41:22.190 --> 02:41:29.870
think at the time. He's not thinking according to God's mind, but he's thinking according to

02:41:29.870 --> 02:41:36.270
a fleshly way of thinking. He is parroting the thoughts of Satan, the devil. And that's the

02:41:36.270 --> 02:41:41.870
reason why he tells him, get behind me, Satan. And of course, Peter took the counsel of the heart,

02:41:41.870 --> 02:41:48.909
didn't he? And he was corrected. We should lay our thoughts alongside God's and we'll see that

02:41:48.909 --> 02:41:56.350
ours will melt away into nothing, into insignificance and a hurry. Now we can think we're headed

02:41:56.350 --> 02:42:02.750
in the right direction, but we're not. And we'll remind of that too in the Bible in Proverbs 14 12,

02:42:02.750 --> 02:42:10.909
says there is a way that seems right to a man, but in the end it leads to death. So we can think

02:42:10.909 --> 02:42:18.829
we're right when we're wrong. It's unwise on our part. Any one of us to follow our heart no matter

02:42:18.829 --> 02:42:29.329
where it leads you. No, it can lead us into trouble and eventual death. You students have a lot

02:42:29.329 --> 02:42:37.969
to think about. So we say to you meditate on what you put into your hearts in the days ahead,

02:42:37.969 --> 02:42:44.370
follow God's thoughts and you will be a blessing. You'll be a blessing to your brothers,

02:42:45.329 --> 02:42:51.090
but not only to your brothers, you'll be a blessing to many others. That's why we say,

02:42:52.049 --> 02:43:23.659
think God's thoughts as much as you can. You good-looking people. Now it's time to share the

02:43:23.659 --> 02:43:29.100
attendance with you if you've got your pens out. You're able to jot it down,

02:43:29.100 --> 02:43:45.979
tablets, whatever you're using. Brooklyn, 3,096. Canada, 504. Jamaica, 97. Fort Lauderdale, Florida,

02:43:46.700 --> 02:44:03.540
10. 10. There are brothers. They're tuned in. Patterson, 3,789. Puerto Rico, 113.

02:44:04.500 --> 02:44:18.579
Wal-Kill, 3,024. Warwick, 1,700. Now add those up real quick. 12,333. Beautiful, isn't it?

02:44:18.579 --> 02:44:45.299
Well, why don't you act like it is. Well, this is the last one. What is the last one? The song you

02:44:45.379 --> 02:44:51.379
are now invited to stand and sing. Now wait a minute. It's the last one in the songbook.

02:44:52.579 --> 02:44:59.299
Song number 135 and During to the Inn, Matthew 2413. And after the song,

02:44:59.860 --> 02:45:07.540
Brother Stanley Weigel, who works with the U.S. Writing Desk, will lead us in our closing prayer.

02:45:07.540 --> 02:45:09.620
Now song number 135.
