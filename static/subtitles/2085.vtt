WEBVTT

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:18.589
know I've had an illness, but I'm getting along all right. There's a little tumor here in the brain,

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:31.780
which the doctors are treating, and whatever comes one way or the other, but it has been

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:41.060
wonderful to work with you all these years, and I enjoy the tremendously, and I'm very

00:00:41.060 --> 00:01:03.070
grateful to you all that I could come to this meeting. Like CT Russell before him,

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:09.549
Brother Noor had an exceptional gift for organizing the Kingdom work. That set the stage for the

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:15.549
amazing growth that the organization experienced during the closing decades of the 20th century.

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:24.109
Nathan Noor died on June 8, 1977. Note what Brother Albert Schroeder, a fellow member of the

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:31.230
Governor Body, wrote about him. As the society's principal administrator, there have come to be over 90

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:37.629
branches. Brother Noor has proved to be the right, theocratic entrepreneur for this period of

00:01:37.629 --> 00:01:45.629
Jehovah's Kingdom work. Brother Noor helped to clarify the role of the governing body and its

00:01:45.629 --> 00:01:52.510
committees. Headquarters representatives were sent out to various branches. Branches were better

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:59.549
organized. Bodies of elders were appointed in various congregations. Training programs were

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:06.189
instituted. Schools were established. Due to the organizational growth, the number of

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:12.270
conventions being held worldwide, now numbered into the hundreds. And the governing body members

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:18.990
wanted to be present at as many of those conventions as possible. For example, at the 1969 Peace

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:24.110
on Earth International Convention, a governing body member would fly to the convention city for

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:31.150
the opening day, catch a flight to another convention city, and then return to the original city so

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:37.949
that he could speak on the closing day. In the 1970s and 80s, many existing branches with printing

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:43.870
and shipping capabilities needed to expand. To ensure that the worldwide supply of spiritual food

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:49.789
would flow uninterrupted, no matter what may happen on the world scene. At times there were more

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:55.710
than 20 branch construction or expansion projects going on simultaneously. And the governing

00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:01.550
body was very interested in each one and eager to dedicate the new facilities once completed.

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:10.990
For me, it was always very encouraging to have contact to the brothers of the governing body,

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:18.669
to see their great zeal and their loving interest in the brothers behind the iron curtain.

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:31.389
1977, something outstanding happened. In 1977, it was possible for brothers Jerez,

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:39.789
friends, and Siddlik to visit the brothers in Poland. So it was the first time, the first time

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:46.270
that members of the governing body could visit the country behind the iron curtain.

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:54.990
They spoke to many overseers, pioneers, and long-time witnesses that was, of course, a wonderful

00:03:54.990 --> 00:04:01.949
experience. One year after this visit, brothers Jerez, along with Brother Henshel, were able to get

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:07.469
an appointment with government officials to promote a more tolerant attitude of Jehovah's

00:04:07.469 --> 00:04:12.189
organization and the work that Jehovah's Witnesses were doing in Eastern Europe, and especially

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:19.389
in Poland. Now mind you, this was all taking place some 10 years prior to the fall of communism

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:25.069
in Eastern Europe. They took various steps to meet with the local brothers in person,

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:30.509
and Brother Barry of the governing body had the opportunity to hold a secret meeting in the

00:04:30.509 --> 00:04:36.589
city of Leningrad with Brother Kose, who was responsible for the activity in the territory. Brother Kose

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:41.790
said that he received tremendous encouragement from that discussion, from the conversation with Brother

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:48.750
Barry. And it was interesting that it wasn't until after that meeting that Brother Kose found out

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:54.750
that he had been talking to a member of the governing body. The brothers in Eastern Europe really

00:04:54.750 --> 00:05:01.230
needed help to resist decades of satanic efforts to destroy their fate in Jehovah, and weaken the

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:08.029
unity and confidence in his organization. And the members of the governing body showed a very

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:16.430
deep appreciation for the brothers who kept the communication to the brothers behind the iron

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:22.829
curtain, because you have to imagine how to get the spiritual food there. They had to be willing

00:05:22.829 --> 00:05:33.629
on a personal risk to visit and to bring the spiritual food towards there, not just to the

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:41.470
countries right close, but down there to the brothers down there to Siberia.

00:05:42.829 --> 00:05:50.860
In the second half of the 1980s, the iron curtain began to open up. There was a sense of freedom in

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:57.420
the air. The brothers in Eastern Europe could feel that freedom. As the government's

00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:05.180
granted permission, the governing body organized conventions in Eastern Black countries, for example,

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:12.779
in Poland and Czechoslovakia. And when bands were lifted, the members of the governing body

00:06:13.259 --> 00:06:20.699
travelled many times, then in all the countries, it was possible, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Czechoslovakia,

00:06:20.699 --> 00:06:26.379
Russia, Ukraine, and to the Baltic States, and also to Belarus.

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:33.740
In November 1989, the Berlin Wall came down. Well, this was a great turning point in the history

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:39.339
of the 20th century, but it also meant greater freedom for our brothers. The governing body

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:44.620
sprung into action. They wanted to go and accelerate the work there, so brother-gerus,

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:48.699
as well as other members of the governing body, closely supervised the work. Therefore,

00:06:48.699 --> 00:06:53.980
the number of visits they made, well, they just skyrocketed. In the fall of 1989,

00:06:54.459 --> 00:06:59.500
brothers Milton Henshel and Theodor Gerus had the unique opportunity of visiting the brothers

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:05.819
in the Soviet Union for the first time. The brothers really wanted to study the situation on the ground.

00:07:06.779 --> 00:07:14.060
They met with all of the elders, circuit overseers, district overseers, and members of the country

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:25.980
committee. It was like one big shepherding visit. So, it's on Europe. 1991 was the stage for three

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:33.420
international conventions, with the subject lovers of godly freedom, but of course, besides these

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:42.060
international conventions, other open conventions. So, not in secret. No, open conventions were

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:50.779
held in the first time in the former Soviet Union, in Estonia, in Russia, and the Ukraine.

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:58.939
Just imagine, after decades of such difficult persecution, we experience the opportunity to be

00:07:58.939 --> 00:08:04.060
together with our worldwide brotherhood, and to see the brothers from the governing body.

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:11.100
It was an unforgettable time. It was the happiest of times. It was super.

00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:22.939
One outstanding convention was held in Zagreb. Yes, it was a loving and a courageous decision

00:08:22.939 --> 00:08:31.420
of the governing body. To go there, despite the uncertainty of the political situation in the

00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:41.820
country, and to maybe coming up a civil war. This convention was the only public event that was

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:49.820
allowed by the government in the city of Zagreb. All other public events were cancelled, but the

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:57.019
convention of Jehovah's Witnesses was not. Police men and soldiers signed to keep security in

00:08:57.019 --> 00:09:05.179
order in the stadium. They were astonished that Serbian, Kuwait's, Slovenians, Montenegro's, Bosnians

00:09:05.179 --> 00:09:14.860
were sitting together in peace and in unity. At those international conventions in Eastern Europe,

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:21.259
members of the governing body gave the final motivating talk. And those talks, given less than

00:09:21.259 --> 00:09:27.980
five months after the thrill of obtaining legal recognition for our work in the Soviet Union,

00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:32.299
strengthened and encouraged our brothers for trials they would face in the future.

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:36.700
It's plain to see that the governing body of years passed,

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:43.500
expanded themselves to no well the appearance of the flock. They poured themselves out like a drink

00:09:44.059 --> 00:09:51.259
in order to take good care of the sheep. The same deep love and tender concern for you,

00:09:51.259 --> 00:09:58.059
the sheep of the Great Shepherd's flock has been evident throughout modern times right down to this day.
