00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:10.109
At Psalm 68 verse 5, Jehovah is called a father of the fatherless.

00:00:10.109 --> 00:00:12.710
Are you a fatherless child?

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:20.030
Or do you have a fatherless child or fatherless children in your congregation?

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:26.589
You may be wondering what do we mean by fatherless child?

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:32.469
Well, in the context of our discussion, we're talking about young people who have only

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:37.469
one believing parent, one parent in the truth.

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.990
Now that allows for a spectrum of possibilities.

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:44.030
It could be a single parent family.

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:51.590
It could be a religiously divided family, and especially when the unbeliever is opposed.

00:00:51.590 --> 00:01:01.560
It could even include a situation where only one parent is actively serving Jehovah.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:07.000
I was five years old when my mother learned the truth from the Bible.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.439
For some years I lived in a religiously divided home, and eventually my mother became a single

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.760
parent, and we dealt with those circumstances.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:25.040
There are many of us here at Bethel, in the field pioneering, serving as missionary,

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:34.680
circuit overseers, construction workers, many of us who experienced similar circumstances.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.840
Interestingly in the Bible, Jehovah saw fit to include the life experience of a young

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.599
man who grew up in a religiously divided home.

00:01:45.599 --> 00:01:47.120
Timothy.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:56.519
The Bible describes him as having a believing Jewish mother, but a Greek father.

00:01:56.519 --> 00:02:02.200
He had only one parent who served Jehovah.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:09.879
Now we know that his mother Eunus and his grandmother Lojas were instrumental in helping

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:13.960
him become well-founded in the truth.

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:20.159
But the scriptures indicate others had a share in his spiritual advancement as well.

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:24.800
And that's where all of us come into this conversation.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:33.639
All of us like Jehovah need to appreciate the fatherless children and our congregations.

00:02:33.639 --> 00:02:37.719
We should view them as modern-day Timothy's.

00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:39.919
How do we do that?

00:02:39.919 --> 00:02:45.000
Well we can learn a lot from the Apostle Paul.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:54.360
Late in the year 49 or early 50 CE, the Apostle Paul on his second missionary journey visited

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:01.080
the city of Listera, and there he observed Timothy.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:07.520
Not just in a casual way, Paul really saw Timothy.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:15.240
He observed his potential and he took the initiative to provide training so that Timothy

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:19.000
could realize that potential.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.319
That's a beautiful example for us.

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:32.479
We need to take note of and encourage the fatherless children in our midst.

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:39.599
The Apostle Paul set a nice example in something that he wrote to Timothy.

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:49.800
In the year 65 CE, Paul was a prisoner in Rome with no prospect of being released.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:54.560
In fact, his death was imminent.

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:01.080
Come to write one more letter, to whom did he write?

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:06.479
To Timothy, his beloved child in the faith.

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:12.319
And what did he have to say to Timothy in this last inspired letter?

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:13.879
Let's read it together.

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:24.079
Second Timothy, chapter 1, 2 Timothy, chapter 1 verse 5.

00:04:24.079 --> 00:04:31.439
For I recall your unhypocritical faith, which dwelled first in your grandmother Loas

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:39.360
and your mother Unas, but which I am confident is also in you.

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.040
Did you notice what Paul did?

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:51.519
In just a few words, he commended and expressed confidence in Timothy.

00:04:51.519 --> 00:04:55.839
But he also commended Timothy's mother and grandmother, didn't he?

00:04:55.839 --> 00:04:59.759
For their unhypocritical faith.

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:07.600
For Loas and Unas, serving Jehovah was not playhacking, their faith was genuine.

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:13.459
What a blessing for Timothy that proved to be.

00:05:13.459 --> 00:05:24.339
Well, in a similar way, we can offer specific, sincere heartfelt commendation to fatherless

00:05:24.339 --> 00:05:33.579
children and their parents and commend them for what they're able to do, include them

00:05:33.579 --> 00:05:38.939
in spiritual and recreational activities.

00:05:38.939 --> 00:05:44.300
When I was a boy, my grandmother used to pick me up every Saturday morning and take me

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.620
in the ministry.

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:52.379
I never had to wonder if she was coming, and I never had to wonder who I would work with.

00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:59.779
The book study conductor, an older brother, would always include my grandmother and me in

00:05:59.779 --> 00:06:02.699
the group with him and his wife.

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:06.500
I cherish those memories.

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:13.100
Pay close attention now, as some who grew up in single-parent homes explained how they

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:21.819
were encouraged to be successful fighters for the faith.

00:06:21.819 --> 00:06:25.060
It felt like a bad dream.

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:28.980
Our family were really zealous in the truth.

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:34.220
We were playing downstairs one day, and Mum came down to tell us she was leaving Jehovah

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:39.699
and leaving Dad, saying goodbye to Mum, that was the hardest day of my life.

00:06:40.259 --> 00:06:45.139
My mother and father became inactive when I was about four years old.

00:06:45.139 --> 00:06:48.660
My father was never really around.

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:53.379
When my Mum started to learn the truth, my Dad said she was forbidden from studying.

00:06:53.379 --> 00:06:57.660
If we were to go to the meetings, he would take us out forcibly.

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:01.420
He became verbally and physically abusive to my Mum.

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:04.860
My parents' breakup was very tough.

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:09.139
It was a struggle for my Mum to raise two boys on her own.

00:07:09.139 --> 00:07:14.259
She would work two or three jobs, and serving Jehovah just took a back seat.

00:07:14.259 --> 00:07:18.139
When my parents divorced, my Mum was very depressed.

00:07:18.139 --> 00:07:23.300
She did the best she could, but Jehovah did an intent for mothers to fill both roles

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:25.420
as parents.

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:29.699
My sisters and I, we made a conscious choice that we weren't going to make the same

00:07:29.699 --> 00:07:32.420
bad choices that Mum did.

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:38.300
We realised that it's up to us, so I dedicated my life to Jehovah and was baptized when

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:40.100
I was 15.

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:45.019
We thrived spiritually when we didn't have the opposition from Dad.

00:07:45.019 --> 00:07:47.740
Now we can go out and service, go to the meetings freely.

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:51.980
We didn't have to hide our literature for fear he would rip them up.

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:58.100
When I was around 15 years old, my Mum took us to the meeting, and she was determined

00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:00.459
that this was going to be her last meeting.

00:08:00.459 --> 00:08:02.980
It was the night of a local needs party.

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:09.259
It was the right time Jehovah just opened my Mum's heart, why?

00:08:09.259 --> 00:08:13.100
After that experience, it was like she was a new woman.

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:15.779
My sisters and I have always been a team.

00:08:15.779 --> 00:08:20.300
We pioneered together, we moved to Cambodia to serve as negrators together.

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:25.300
They're both in special full-time service with their husbands in Cambodia, and I've been

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:30.540
serving here in Myanmar Bethel along with my husband for just over 11 years now.

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:33.460
My Mum set a stellar example for me to follow.

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:37.379
Her relationship with Jehovah was always above everything else.

00:08:37.379 --> 00:08:42.580
It was her example that helped me to set and reach spiritual goals.

00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:47.899
I started pioneering during my senior year of high school, in nearly 20 years of full-time

00:08:47.899 --> 00:08:53.580
service, spending most of that time at Brooklyn Bethel and Warwick with my wife.

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:58.299
My Mum had a very strong influence on theocratic goals.

00:08:58.299 --> 00:09:03.379
My wife and I had the privilege of attending the first school, the Kingdom Evangelisers,

00:09:03.379 --> 00:09:07.100
and currently we're serving in the circuit work.

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:10.419
No one needs to be defined by their negative circumstances.

00:09:10.419 --> 00:09:14.620
First Peter 5-10 says, God Himself will complete your training.

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:20.059
It might be tough at times, but what Jehovah's help you can succeed.

00:09:20.059 --> 00:09:24.620
It reminds me of what David said in the 27th Psalm in verse 10.

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:31.620
He said, even if my father or mother abandoned me, Jehovah would take me in.

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:35.460
That was definitely the case in my situation.

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:39.100
Jehovah doesn't define us by our upbringing or our past.

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:42.220
He sees our potential, so it's up to us.

00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:48.720
With Jehovah we can be anything we want to be.

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:53.200
Well we appreciate those beautiful expressions.

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:57.639
So those of you who are fatherless children.

00:09:57.679 --> 00:10:01.080
How do you see yourself?

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:04.360
Do you see yourself as Jehovah sees you?

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:08.679
As a unique individual with potential?

00:10:08.679 --> 00:10:13.559
Certainly you're not inferior in any way because of your circumstance.

00:10:13.559 --> 00:10:18.159
Did you appreciate the comments made by those in the video?

00:10:18.159 --> 00:10:23.120
Your circumstances don't have to define you.

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:34.679
We would add this, your unique experience in life gives you a unique perspective and

00:10:34.679 --> 00:10:40.480
Jehovah may be able to use you to help others.

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:43.000
So be a Timothy.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:49.879
At a young age, relatively speaking, Timothy was a spiritual man entrusted with responsibility.

00:10:49.879 --> 00:10:55.720
The Apostle Paul described him as having a disposition like no one else's.

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:59.000
Timothy cared for others.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.799
You can do the same.

00:11:00.799 --> 00:11:01.799
Reach out.

00:11:01.799 --> 00:11:10.559
Be a pioneer, a Bethelite, a field missionary, a construction worker, a circuit overseer.

00:11:10.559 --> 00:11:18.639
You young brothers qualify and reach out to be a ministerial servant and then an elder.

00:11:18.639 --> 00:11:21.759
The opportunities are endless.

00:11:21.759 --> 00:11:26.399
Allow Jehovah to use you.

00:11:26.399 --> 00:11:32.960
And continue to cultivate appreciation for your loyal parent.

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:38.720
I know I appreciate my mother very much for her fine example of faith through a number

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:41.919
of very trying circumstances.

00:11:41.919 --> 00:11:48.000
We don't take the faithfulness of our single parents for granted.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:57.159
Well, in conclusion, we want to assure you that you can be a successful fighter for the

00:11:57.159 --> 00:12:00.559
faith, just as Timothy was.

00:12:00.559 --> 00:12:08.159
We have confidence in you and we pray Jehovah's continued rich blessing on your service

00:12:08.159 --> 00:12:10.480
to him.

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:16.480
Father Joel Dalinger, a helper to the service committee, will consider the final talk of

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:18.440
this symposium.

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:22.720
Successful fighters for the faith, single Christians.
