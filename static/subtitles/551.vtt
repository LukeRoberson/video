00:00:01.169 --> 00:00:10.169
Now, we are talking about worldly desires and worldly desires may entice us to do wrong for selfish advantage.

00:00:10.169 --> 00:00:17.170
An expression of this selfishness is the worldly desire of instant gratification.

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:23.170
Our theme today is therefore, reject the desire of instant gratification.

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.170
We will answer two questions.

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:29.170
Why is instant gratification a problem?

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:36.170
And how does God undeserved kindness help us to resist instant gratification?

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.170
To our first question, why is instant gratification a problem?

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.170
What is instant gratification?

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:51.170
Now, instant or immediate gratification means exchanging a future benefit

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:57.170
in order to obtain a less rewarding but more immediate benefit.

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.170
A prominent example is Esau.

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:06.170
He was willing to trade his birthright with its future blessings for a quick meal.

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:12.170
While this example shows that the desire of immediate gratification has always existed,

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.170
today it's more of a problem, why?

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:24.170
Because technology and social media with the world at our fingertips makes it harder to delay gratification,

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.170
everything is possible and without rating.

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:37.170
For instance, almost all advertisements contain offers for paying later or loan financing.

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.170
So why wait and save before buying?

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:51.170
Sadly, many ignore the warning in Proverbs 22 verse 7 and experience the consequences of being a slave to the lender.

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.170
Or another example.

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.170
Think of the effect instant gratification can have on relationships.

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:06.170
If we are upset with somebody, it might us make feel good to send an angry text message.

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:14.169
However, we know that first taking the time to examine our feelings, the feelings of the other,

00:02:14.169 --> 00:02:21.169
and followed then by a face-to-face communication is the better and more successful course,

00:02:21.169 --> 00:02:24.169
although more time consuming.

00:02:24.169 --> 00:02:25.169
A third example.

00:02:25.169 --> 00:02:31.169
Today you can easily find a marriage partner by using the internet.

00:02:31.169 --> 00:02:34.169
By doing this, creating instant gratification.

00:02:34.169 --> 00:02:39.169
Yet statistics reveal the short lifespan of those relationships.

00:02:39.169 --> 00:02:42.169
Jehovah on the other hand highlights the value of patience.

00:02:42.169 --> 00:02:48.169
It takes time to get to know ourselves, to get to know the prospective partner,

00:02:48.169 --> 00:02:51.169
and to prepare a healthy relationship.

00:02:51.169 --> 00:02:59.169
This makes a successful marriage much more likely, resulting in lasting benefits.

00:02:59.169 --> 00:03:04.169
These were just a few examples of the attitude that has shaped our modern world.

00:03:04.169 --> 00:03:12.169
Yes, we live in a society that is governed by greed with its bad consequences.

00:03:12.169 --> 00:03:22.169
That brings us to our second question, how does God's undeserved kindness help us to resist instant gratification?

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:26.169
Let us please open to our text for today.

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:32.169
This is Titus chapter 2 to find out why do we talk about God's undeserved kindness?

00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:37.169
Let us read here Titus chapter 2 beginning with verse 11.

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:46.169
There we read, for the undeserved kindness of God has been manifested, bringing salvation to all sorts of people.

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:53.169
And now our days text comes, it, the undeserved kindness of God,

00:03:53.169 --> 00:03:59.169
trains us to reject ungodliness and worldly desires.

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:05.169
Did you notice what helps us to reject worldly desire?

00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:10.169
It is, according to verse 11, God's undeserved kindness.

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:14.169
Yet what exactly is God's undeserved kindness?

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:21.170
And how does it help us to reject the desire of instant gratification?

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:28.170
Now the world translated here with undeserved kindness conveys the thought of a free gift,

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:34.170
of something that is unearned and unmerited.

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:37.170
This gift is expressed in various ways.

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:45.170
And here in verse 11 Paul refers to the greatest expression of this godly undeserved kindness,

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:47.170
the ransom sacrifice of Jesus.

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:57.170
Jehovah forgives us our sins which opens the door to many other wonderful blessings, for example.

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:02.170
We can enjoy a wonderful close relationship with Jehovah.

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:08.170
This good relationship will enable us to resist pressure.

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:09.170
How?

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:13.170
Let us illustrate this by means of a situation in David's life.

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:18.170
For quite some time David had to flee from Saul.

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:26.170
Now if we turn to 1 Samuel chapter 24, we see that David was hiding in the cave.

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:30.170
And it was this cave that King Saul entered to rest.

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:38.170
Would David now give in to the temptation and to kill Saul and to end the time of being in the wilderness,

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:41.170
and now finally reign as King?

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:44.170
Let us read here in 1 Samuel 24 verse 4,

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:50.170
and see how David's man encouraged him to find instant gratification.

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:53.170
Here in verse 4 we read, David's man said to him,

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:57.170
this is the day on which Jehovah is saying to you,

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:00.170
look I'm giving your enemy into your hand,

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:05.170
and you can do to him whatever seems good to you.

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:07.170
So what would David do?

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:11.170
We know that David resisted the temptation.

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:12.170
But why?

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:13.170
Let's look in verse 6.

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:15.170
Here we read,

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:19.170
he, David said to his man, it is unthinkable from Jehovah's standpoint

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:23.170
that I should do such a thing to my Lord, the anointed of Jehovah,

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:29.170
by lifting my hand against him for he is the anointed of Jehovah.

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:35.170
Jehovah, David enjoyed a close relationship with Jehovah.

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:40.170
He knew God's thinking and he was able to apply Godly principles.

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:47.170
The many prayers recorded in the Bible show us that David put all his trust on Jehovah.

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:54.170
This made him read, he chose delayed gratification.

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:59.170
Now how are we equipped to resist the worldly desire of instant gratification?

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:04.170
Remember, if we approach our close friend Jehovah,

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:08.170
according to Philippians 4 verse 6 and 7 in prayer,

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:12.170
then his peace will guard our heart.

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:16.170
And then we further prepare our hearts by our regular studies.

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:20.170
They help us to get acquainted with Jehovah's principles.

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:24.170
So then if we want something instantly,

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:28.170
at a price that could endanger our good priorities in our life,

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:34.170
then our close relationship with Jehovah helps us to choose the long term benefit

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:38.670
over instant gratification.

00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:43.670
A second way, how the undeserved kindness of God helps us to resist instant gratification

00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:48.670
is looking into the future and seeing the bigger picture.

00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:51.670
This is what Jesus did.

00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:56.670
In Hebrews 12 verse 2, the Apostle Paul described Jesus' future,

00:07:56.670 --> 00:08:00.670
the joy that was set before him.

00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:03.670
Jesus saw his future in heaven,

00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:08.670
and he did not give in to create immediate relief.

00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:13.670
Take the example when Satan offered to him all the kingdoms.

00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:15.670
Jesus understood the bigger picture.

00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:18.670
He understood his role in God's purpose,

00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:23.670
and this allowed him to resist the temptation

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:28.670
and to not go for the immediate benefit, but resist the offer.

00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:31.670
So I'll be not doing the same.

00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:35.669
We visualise ourselves being in Jehovah's New World.

00:08:35.669 --> 00:08:41.669
Well, coming loved ones, teaching them, keeping this conviction,

00:08:41.669 --> 00:08:48.669
this hope alive helps us to resist the desire of instant gratification

00:08:48.669 --> 00:08:52.669
and to wait for the long term benefit.

00:08:52.669 --> 00:08:54.669
So in conclusion,

00:08:54.669 --> 00:08:59.669
resisting the desire of instant gratification helps us to make wise decisions

00:08:59.669 --> 00:09:02.669
when it comes to material pursuits or relationships.

00:09:02.669 --> 00:09:07.669
Jehovah's undeserved kindness and form of a close relationship helps us

00:09:07.669 --> 00:09:10.669
to prepare our heart today.

00:09:10.669 --> 00:09:16.669
And the gift of our wonderful whole helps us to see ourselves in the future,

00:09:16.669 --> 00:09:22.669
with all the benefits that are outweigh by far instant gratification.
