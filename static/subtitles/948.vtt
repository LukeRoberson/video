00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:11.869
My father always taught me that we need a God in our life in order for there to be peace.

00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:15.669
And he always wanted to know, can Christians go to war?

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:21.910
How is this consistent with the gospel of Jesus Christ?

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.429
But the pastor could never give us an answer.

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:28.750
And so I thought I'd have to look to politics to find it.

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:36.100
A lot of peace movements were being formed at that time, so I joined one of them.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:44.659
We decided where the protest marches would be, which pamphlets we would use.

00:00:44.659 --> 00:00:49.700
But after the protests were over, everyone was so excited.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.939
And they all started applauding and cheering for the leaders.

00:00:53.939 --> 00:00:57.619
I thought, that's not what I wanted.

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:59.539
I don't want to honor people.

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:03.020
I want to have world peace.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:09.939
And that still hasn't happened yet.

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:13.420
Then I started to feel very alone.

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.019
And it made me feel unsafe in this world.

00:01:16.019 --> 00:01:22.159
With no peace in sight, I thought, what is the purpose of life?

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:27.909
While visiting friends for coffee, I saw a man I'd never met before.

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:34.519
My friends told me he wanted to talk to us about the Bible.

00:01:34.519 --> 00:01:38.000
So I asked him, sir, what do you think?

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.079
Can Christians join the military?

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:49.569
And the man said, no, that's not allowed because the Bible says you should love your enemy.

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:58.780
It made me think about what my father always said, that when he got to bring peace, then

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.819
a really nice lady came to my door and she had an orange book in her hand.

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:15.150
And it said, true peace and security, after reading it, I thought, this is it.

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:21.439
This is the organization that truly wants peace.

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:25.840
So I went to those involved in the peace movement.

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.400
I told them that I believe that God will change this world into a beautiful earth where

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.750
they'll be true peace.

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.189
They all looked at me like I had lost my mind.

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:39.629
I was so happy with my new life.

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:44.469
I felt like I was part of a family who truly cared about one another and really wanted peace

00:02:44.469 --> 00:02:50.789
with each other.

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:58.229
Isaiah 14 verse 7 had a major impact on my life because there are God promises, a calm

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:59.229
and peaceful world.
