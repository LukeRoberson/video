00:00:01.229 --> 00:00:13.330
The governing body, when they had in mind reformating or redesigning the website, realized

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:18.809
that this was the front door to our organization for many new persons.

00:00:18.809 --> 00:00:24.170
The motivation behind making all these adjustments for the new website, primarily we had in

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:29.010
mind to reach as many as possible with the good news of the kingdom.

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.810
This is a worldwide organization, the preaching work is being done in all kinds of lands.

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:47.560
The website has helped me to become a better teacher.

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:54.560
Now I'm able to preach to students from the university, including those that speak other languages.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:01:06.810
They can use everyday tools such as their cell phones or tablets to choose topics that interest them at the time convenient for them.

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:14.810
I work as a taxi driver and I share the Bible's message by introducing our JW.org site to the passengers.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:21.810
Young people often have smartphones, so when I tell them our website address, they look it up immediately.

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.810
I have interesting conversations with people using recent issues of our magazines.

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:33.730
When they suggest that they download their very own copy, they do it right on the spot.

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:38.730
I wanted to show the video about bullying because it's very good.

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:44.730
I gave my teacher a piece of paper and he said, hmm, maybe we can watch it.

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:51.730
I chose to show the class the video my student recommended because it's a topic relevant to all children.

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:55.730
I think the QR code is a really good way to introduce people to the website.

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:02.730
The fact they can take a shot of the QR code and immediately they can have information in their own language right there is really appealing for them.

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:13.419
I usually take the subway to work and at times I witness to people sitting next to me showing them our website online.

00:02:13.419 --> 00:02:20.419
Using the website helps me to enjoy the ministry because it enables me to approach people more freely.

00:02:20.419 --> 00:02:28.830
When I'm browsing the website if I find an interesting article for a return visit or a Bible study, I can just send it to them in a link.

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:41.900
We wanted to make it easy to use and appealing so the persons could find out who your harvest witnesses are, what we believe and how they can contact us.

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.900
For many years I've had been attending church but I had many questions that I've been unanswered.

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:54.900
So I decided to search on the internet for my answers and I ended up with the jdw.org link.

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.900
It was a breath of fresh air, very simple to understand.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:10.150
Because I'm 78 years old, I didn't think I could use it. I thought it was made for young people.

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.150
My grandchildren helped me to use the website.

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:20.150
I can listen to the publications and I can have the text size increased so that I can see it properly.

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:31.659
Now that we've seen the results of this new redesigned website, we can honestly say that it has gone beyond anything that we hope for.

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:46.939
This website is a powerful tool and Jehovah God has blessed us and my question to you would be, are you using it to the full?
