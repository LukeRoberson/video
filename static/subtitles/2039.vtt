00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:10.539
An introduction to the Bible, the Bible is a collection of ancient writings or books

00:00:10.539 --> 00:00:14.580
that contain God's message for all people.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:20.100
This message was put down in writing by approximately 40 different men.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:27.820
It was written in Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek using Hebrew letters and Greek letters.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:33.979
The writers came from many different backgrounds and lived in various places throughout the

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:37.060
ancient Near East and Southern Europe.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.219
Yet everything in the Bible harmonizes.

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:43.619
There are no contradictions.

00:00:43.619 --> 00:00:49.100
By various means God put His thoughts into the minds of these writers.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.899
That is why the Bible says that all scripture is inspired of God.

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.899
People writing began in 1513 BCE.

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:03.299
It continued for the next 1,600 years.

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:09.750
The last books of the Bible to be written were completed about 98 CE.

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.030
The Bible's 66 books are grouped into two main sections.

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:20.030
The Hebrew Scriptures, often called the Old Testament and the Christian Greek Scriptures,

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.370
commonly called the New Testament.

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:29.609
The Hebrew Scriptures make up the first 39 books of the Bible.

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:35.290
The Pentateuch, or first five books, describe the creation of all things and the founding

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.810
of the ancient nation of Israel.

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:44.730
The historical books show how, after the nation of Israel enters the Promised Land, Israel

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:52.489
is unfaithful to God and is taken into exile but eventually returns to its homeland.

00:01:52.489 --> 00:01:58.730
The poetic books feature sacred songs and practical wisdom for daily living.

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:04.209
The prophetic books foretell future events and contain instructions and warnings for God's

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:06.010
people.

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:11.009
The last 27 books of the Bible make up the Christian Greek Scriptures.

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:19.210
First, there are the four Gospels, a history of Jesus' earthly life and ministry.

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:25.530
Then Acts of Apostles narrates the history of the early Christian congregation.

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:32.210
There are 21 letters that contain practical counsel and encouragement for Christians.

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:40.379
The last book, Revelation, contains a series of prophetic visions.

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:47.139
In the Bible, God identifies Himself as the Creator, outlines His purpose, and reveals

00:02:47.139 --> 00:02:53.740
His personal name, Jehovah, shown here in ancient Hebrew lettering.

00:02:53.740 --> 00:03:01.460
Did you know, unlike any other book, the Bible magnifies God's name, Jehovah.

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:08.120
It mentions His name over 7,000 times, more than any other name.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:14.800
Jehovah's purpose is for all intelligent creatures to live forever under His rulership.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:22.000
In early in human history, Jehovah's sovereignty, or right to rule, was challenged by a rebellious

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.039
spirit creature called Satan, who spoke by means of a snake.

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:33.840
How Jehovah will clear His name and restore His rulership by means of His kingdom is the

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.680
theme of the Bible.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:43.520
To answer Satan's accusations, Jehovah allows humans to pursue their own course.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.879
He's a disastrous human rule follow.

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:53.360
Meanwhile, Jehovah arranges to accomplish His purpose by means of a Savior, the Messiah,

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.759
who will eventually become King of God's kingdom.

00:03:57.759 --> 00:04:03.159
In time, Jehovah reveals who this Messiah will be.

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:08.960
Jesus, a spirit son of God, is miraculously born as a human.

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:15.400
He teaches people about Jehovah and sacrifices His life to save mankind.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.800
God then resurrects Jesus back to heavenly life.

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:26.480
The Bible says that Jesus rids the heavens of all those who do not support God's sovereignty.

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:33.519
As King of God's kingdom, Jesus is joined by 144,000 co-rulers who have been bought from

00:04:33.519 --> 00:04:35.879
the earth.

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:40.480
His kingdom will restore the earth to ideal conditions.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.720
Jehovah's purpose will be fulfilled.

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:49.800
All faithful intelligent creatures will unites worship Him forever as their one true God

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.920
and sovereign.

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:59.360
As you read and study the Bible, note its internal harmony and practical wisdom, as well

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.519
as how each book contributes to its overall theme.

00:05:03.519 --> 00:05:08.720
The vindication of Jehovah's name, which will be accomplished by means of His heavenly

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:13.360
kingdom in the hands of His only begotten Son, Jesus Christ.
