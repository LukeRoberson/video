00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:04.750
Why does God permit human suffering?

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:07.750
Well, that's an easy one, isn't it?

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:11.750
It's one of the first things we learned when we got the truth.

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:16.750
How many times have we explained from the scriptures that Jehovah's sovereignty

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:21.750
needs to be vindicated because the devil challenged it?

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.750
And his name needs to be sanctified because Satan has reproached it.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:36.750
And lovers of Jehovah need to keep integrity, remain faithful, under difficult circumstances

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.750
because Satan holds no one loves Jehovah or his sovereignty that much.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:48.750
Yes, if there's anything we know how to explain from our years of study of the scriptures,

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.750
it is why God permits human suffering.

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.750
And yet, when we're the ones suffering, when we ourselves encounter trial

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.750
some situations, an amazing thing happens.

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.750
We start to ask, well, why is Jehovah permitting this?

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.750
Have I displeased him? Have I lost his favor?

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.750
Is Jehovah punishing me for something?

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:19.750
In other words, why is Jehovah permitting my human suffering?

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.750
And we know the answer. It's the same answer.

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:29.750
It's just that as humans, it is so easy for us to lose focus when we're the ones suffering.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.750
It's easy for us to get absorbed in our own problems, our troubles,

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:39.750
even to the point where relatively minor issues loom large in our mind

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.750
and we temporarily lose perspective.

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.750
Even so, if we look outside ourselves

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:55.750
and view our personal circumstances in the light of Jehovah's purpose to vindicate his sovereignty

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.750
things make more sense.

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.750
We feel a little better.

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.750
We're even in a better position to cope.

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:09.750
Therefore, when we catch ourselves becoming overly self-absorbed,

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.750
we need to give ourselves an important reminder.

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:20.750
Namely, the big issue is Jehovah's purpose to vindicate his sovereignty

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:27.750
which we support by remaining faithful under difficult circumstances.

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.750
It's not new light.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.750
It's one of the first things we learned when we got the truth

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.750
but it does remind us why we do not expect Jehovah to shield us

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.750
from all difficulties in this system.

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.750
As our kingdom's song number 17 says,

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.750
Soldiers of Judd do not seek a life of ease.

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.750
Not in this system.

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:56.750
No, now is the time to uphold Jehovah's sovereignty by our integrity.

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:03.750
Well, what can help us not just grasp that perspective but call it to mind as needed?

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.750
That's what this talk is about.

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.750
And we're going to approach it with three questions.

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:17.750
First, what are some Bible accounts that can remind us to view our circumstances

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.750
in the light of Jehovah's purpose to vindicate his sovereignty?

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:31.750
Number two, does the great importance of Jehovah's sovereignty render us unimportant to God?

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:37.750
And number three, how can you and I best uphold Jehovah's sovereignty?

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.750
So first, some Bible accounts starting with this one.

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.750
Who said these sharp cutting words?

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.750
The injury done to me is your fault.

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.750
May Jehovah judge between me and you.

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:50.750
Who said that?

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:52.750
Well, I think you know.

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.750
But let's get the context.

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:00.750
Genesis 16.5 gives us the quote in its entirety.

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:08.509
Genesis 16.5 says,

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:10.509
At this, Sarah, I said to Abram,

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:13.509
the injury done to me is your fault.

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:16.509
I was the one who put my servant in your arms,

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:20.509
but when she realized that she was pregnant, she began to despise me.

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:25.509
May Jehovah judge between me and you.

00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:31.509
So this was Sarah speaking to Abraham.

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:35.509
Is this the same Sarah who called Abraham my Lord in her heart?

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:38.509
The very one.

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:42.509
So why was she so upset in this instance?

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:45.509
Well, we know Jehovah had promised Abraham offspring.

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:48.509
Sarah got to reasoning that she was past childbearing age.

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:52.509
She offered her servant Heygar as a concubine for Abraham.

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:59.509
Nowhere do the scriptures condemn that decision as faithless or immoral,

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:06.509
even so to give her husband a child by means of another woman

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:10.509
that could not have been an easy thing for Sarah to do.

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:14.509
And then on top of that, Heygar uses her pregnancy as a reason

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:17.509
to treat Sarah as inferior.

00:05:17.509 --> 00:05:25.509
All of this put a new tension into the home of Abraham and Sarah,

00:05:26.509 --> 00:05:31.509
an ongoing domestic strain that they had to live with no doubt

00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:34.509
over some period of time.

00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:37.509
Now what do you think was harder for Abraham and Sarah to live with?

00:05:37.509 --> 00:05:38.509
Dwelling intense?

00:05:38.509 --> 00:05:40.509
Or this?

00:05:40.509 --> 00:05:42.509
It was a trial.

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:45.949
So here's a question.

00:05:45.949 --> 00:05:51.949
Couldn't Jehovah have spared Abraham and Sarah a lot of grief

00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:59.949
by telling Abraham early on that the mother of the promised offspring

00:05:59.949 --> 00:06:01.949
would be Sarah, right?

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:07.949
How many times had Jehovah spoken to Abraham about this promised offspring?

00:06:07.949 --> 00:06:12.949
And yet he did not disclose that Sarah would be the mother until Ishmael

00:06:12.949 --> 00:06:15.949
was in his early teens?

00:06:15.949 --> 00:06:18.949
What happened there?

00:06:18.949 --> 00:06:23.949
At the very least, couldn't Jehovah have intervened when Sarah began

00:06:23.949 --> 00:06:26.949
to offer Heygar as a concubine for Abraham?

00:06:26.949 --> 00:06:31.949
Why didn't Jehovah say anything or do anything?

00:06:31.949 --> 00:06:33.949
Well, the Bible doesn't tell us.

00:06:33.949 --> 00:06:37.949
But when we give ourselves that important reminder to view this account

00:06:37.949 --> 00:06:41.949
in the light of Jehovah's purpose, what do we see?

00:06:41.949 --> 00:06:46.949
We see that those periodic communications from Jehovah to Abraham

00:06:47.949 --> 00:06:53.949
were not about sparing Abraham from difficulties.

00:06:53.949 --> 00:06:55.949
Domestic or otherwise?

00:06:55.949 --> 00:06:57.949
No.

00:06:57.949 --> 00:07:02.949
Those communications from Jehovah to Abraham were about furthering Jehovah's

00:07:02.949 --> 00:07:05.949
developing purpose.

00:07:05.949 --> 00:07:10.949
Outside of that, Abraham and Sarah had to do pretty much like other servants of God

00:07:10.949 --> 00:07:13.949
work through life's difficulties.

00:07:13.949 --> 00:07:18.949
And live as best they could with the decisions they've made.

00:07:18.949 --> 00:07:25.949
In other words, Abraham's role did not exempt him from suffering.

00:07:25.949 --> 00:07:32.949
It meant just the opposite, remaining faithful to Jehovah despite the suffering.

00:07:32.949 --> 00:07:35.949
And Abraham and Sarah did that.

00:07:35.949 --> 00:07:40.949
They continued to worship Jehovah faithfully through the hardships

00:07:40.949 --> 00:07:46.949
and Jehovah treasured their integrity, even calling Abraham my friend.

00:07:46.949 --> 00:07:48.949
Here's the point.

00:07:48.949 --> 00:07:52.949
This account involving Abraham and Sarah takes us back to the important reminder

00:07:52.949 --> 00:07:58.949
that the big issue really is Jehovah's purpose to vindicate his sovereignty,

00:07:58.949 --> 00:08:05.949
which we support by remaining faithful under difficult circumstances.

00:08:06.949 --> 00:08:12.949
So perhaps like Abraham, you're suffering the undesirable results of a decision

00:08:12.949 --> 00:08:15.949
that you made in the past.

00:08:15.949 --> 00:08:19.949
Not necessarily a poor decision or a wrong decision.

00:08:19.949 --> 00:08:23.949
It could have been, we're imperfect, but it might have just been a decision

00:08:23.949 --> 00:08:25.949
that you made in good faith.

00:08:25.949 --> 00:08:27.949
You even prayed about it.

00:08:27.949 --> 00:08:33.950
But now, in retrospect, you look back and you feel that if you had only known

00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:41.259
undesirable consequences that would ensue, you'd have made a different choice.

00:08:41.259 --> 00:08:45.259
Now you pray that Jehovah will relieve you of its ongoing ramifications,

00:08:45.259 --> 00:08:48.259
but there is no relief in sight.

00:08:48.259 --> 00:08:52.259
Why is Jehovah permitting this to go on?

00:08:52.259 --> 00:08:54.259
Because you've displeased him?

00:08:54.259 --> 00:08:56.259
Because you lost his favor?

00:08:56.259 --> 00:08:58.259
No.

00:08:58.259 --> 00:09:04.259
Now you are upholding Jehovah's sovereignty by serving him faithfully

00:09:04.259 --> 00:09:13.269
under difficult circumstances and Jehovah treasures your integrity.

00:09:13.269 --> 00:09:18.269
Now this next Bible account involves one of Jehovah's faithful servants

00:09:18.269 --> 00:09:24.269
who agonized over a situation that existed only in his own mind.

00:09:24.269 --> 00:09:30.480
Let's read about it at Genesis chapter 37.

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:36.480
Here we read about Jacob who was told that Joseph his favorite son was dead.

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:44.860
We read his response that Genesis 37 verses 34 and 35.

00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:50.860
It says, with that Jacob ripped his garments apart and put sack cloth around his waist

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:54.860
and mourned his son for many days.

00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:58.860
And all his sons and all his daughters kept trying to comfort him,

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:05.860
but he kept refusing to take comfort, saying, I will go down into the grave morning my son

00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:09.860
and his father continued weeping for him.

00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:17.860
So yes, Jacob was profoundly affected by the apparent death of his son.

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:23.860
As any parent would be, the fact that he had many other children

00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:28.860
did not eliminate his grief, but here's the irony.

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:30.860
Joseph was not dead.

00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:32.860
He was alive.

00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:34.860
Jacob didn't know that.

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:37.860
He believed Joseph was dead.

00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:45.860
And so he went through all the stages of grief just as if Joseph had actually died.

00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:47.860
So here's our question.

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:54.860
Couldn't Jehovah have spared Jacob this heartache by appearing to him in a dream

00:10:54.860 --> 00:11:01.860
as he had on previous occasions and just told him?

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:07.860
Jacob have no fear. Joseph's alive. Why didn't Jehovah do that?

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:10.860
Again, the Bible doesn't tell us.

00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:16.860
But when we give ourselves that important reminder to view this account in the light

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:19.860
of Jehovah's purpose, what do we see?

00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:27.860
We see that Jehovah's occasional communications with Jacob were not about shielding him from hardship.

00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:33.860
Jacob's role in Jehovah's purpose did not mean being exempt.

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:38.860
It meant serving Jehovah despite the hardships

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:44.860
because those communications from Jehovah to Jacob were about Jehovah's furthering purpose

00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:46.860
in which Jacob had a role.

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:50.860
But it meant remaining faithful under hardship.

00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:53.860
And Jacob did that.

00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:56.860
Jacob did not abandon Jehovah.

00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:57.860
He didn't reason look.

00:11:57.860 --> 00:12:01.860
If Jehovah cannot protect my son on a simple errand out there,

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:05.860
then he's no more powerful than the gods of the nations.

00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:06.860
No.

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:12.860
Jacob kept serving Jehovah even with tears

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:15.860
and Jehovah treasured his integrity.

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:22.860
Centuries later, Jehovah was still calling himself the god of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:29.860
Here's the point. This account about Jacob takes us back to the important reminder

00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:36.860
that the big issue really is Jehovah's purpose to vindicate his sovereignty,

00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:42.860
which we support by remaining faithful under difficult circumstances.

00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:45.860
So perhaps like Jacob,

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:51.860
you might be going through a period where you're serving Jehovah with tears.

00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:54.860
It could be due to the loss of a loved one in death.

00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:57.860
It could be due to the loss of a loved one to Satan's world,

00:12:57.860 --> 00:13:05.860
or it could even be a problem that exists primarily in the mind, like ongoing depression.

00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:09.860
Why is Jehovah permitting this to go on?

00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:10.860
He's punishing me.

00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:11.860
I've lost his favor.

00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:12.860
I've displeased him.

00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:13.860
No.

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:20.860
You are upholding Jehovah's sovereignty by continuing to serve him faithfully

00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:23.860
under difficult circumstances.

00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:27.860
And Jehovah treasures your integrity.

00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:32.450
Now this third account is a little different.

00:13:32.450 --> 00:13:37.450
It's about a man whose biggest test of integrity might lie ahead

00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:41.450
in the New World, and that would be Euryah, who will inevitably learn

00:13:41.450 --> 00:13:45.450
that David had relations with his wife, and then married her,

00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:50.450
and he will learn another detail, one that might just drive home to him,

00:13:50.450 --> 00:13:53.450
just how cruelly he was betrayed.

00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:57.450
Now as we read about it in 2 Samuel 11,

00:13:57.450 --> 00:14:03.450
imagine yourself as Euryah in the New World,

00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:06.450
reading these words for the first time.

00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:11.820
2 Samuel 11 verses 14 and 15.

00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:16.820
So in the morning, David wrote a letter to Jehovah

00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:19.820
and sent it by the hand of Euryah.

00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:24.820
He wrote in the letter, put Euryah in the front lines where the fighting is the fiercest,

00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:29.820
then retreat from behind him so that he will be struck down and die.

00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:35.820
So yes, Euryah will learn that letter that he personally

00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:44.820
delivered to Jehovah, and that he evidently didn't take a peek at along the way,

00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:50.820
contained orders for his own death signed by David.

00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:53.820
Will Euryah forgive repentant David?

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:56.820
Could be a test for him, couldn't it?

00:14:56.820 --> 00:15:02.820
But that may not be Euryah's biggest spiritual challenge.

00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:08.820
What about reconciling himself with the fact that Jehovah?

00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:13.820
Jehovah allowed these things to happen to him and then forgave David,

00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:16.820
and then allowed David to retain the kingship.

00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:19.820
How will Euryah feel about that?

00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:26.820
How will he feel about the fact that Jehovah exalted David to one of the most honored individuals

00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:28.820
in the Bible record?

00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:33.820
Seems as if every king thereafter was graded as either good or bad,

00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:38.820
depending on how close he came to David's example.

00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:44.820
And how will Euryah feel about the fact that Jehovah chose Solomon,

00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:52.820
a son by David and Bathsheba, to become the next king and to write Bible books?

00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:54.820
Will Euryah take the position?

00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:58.820
If that's the kind of God Jehovah is, if that's his idea of justice,

00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:01.820
I want nothing further to do with him.

00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:06.820
Will he nurture the attitude that I guess from Jehovah's viewpoint,

00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:11.820
if you're a Jew like David, you can do anything you want, and it's all right.

00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:16.820
But if you're a man of the nations like me, a hitite, you just don't count.

00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:20.820
Or will Euryah do like first Peter 5.6 says,

00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:25.820
humble yourself under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt you in due time.

00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:34.820
Yes, will Euryah humbly endeavor to see his betrayal in the light of Jehovah's purpose

00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:38.820
and then work to further that purpose?

00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:44.820
Well, of course, we don't know whether these matters will even be issues for Euryah in the New World.

00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:46.820
The Bible doesn't comment on that.

00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:50.820
The thing is though, when we read this account through the eyes of Euryah,

00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:53.820
like we just did, what stands out?

00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:55.820
What just jumps off the page?

00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:58.820
Well, Euryah was cruelly betrayed.

00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:02.820
He was a victim of a horrible injustice.

00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:06.819
But when we give ourselves that important reminder

00:17:06.819 --> 00:17:12.819
to view this account in the light of Jehovah's purpose, what do we see?

00:17:12.819 --> 00:17:16.819
That it wasn't about Euryah or his life or his wife.

00:17:16.819 --> 00:17:23.819
It was about Jehovah's purpose, which guarantees that God will in due time

00:17:23.819 --> 00:17:29.819
more than compensate for all the injustices experienced in this system.

00:17:29.819 --> 00:17:31.819
Here's the point.

00:17:31.819 --> 00:17:35.819
This account involving Euryah takes us back to the important reminder

00:17:35.819 --> 00:17:40.819
that the big issue really is Jehovah's purpose to vindicate his sovereignty,

00:17:40.819 --> 00:17:46.819
which we support by remaining faithful under difficult circumstances.

00:17:46.819 --> 00:17:52.819
So at times we might feel that like Euryah, at least to some extent,

00:17:52.819 --> 00:17:58.819
we've been mistreated, misunderstood, or overlooked in some way.

00:17:58.819 --> 00:18:04.819
But we don't allow that to distance us from Jehovah or from his organization.

00:18:04.819 --> 00:18:11.819
Rather, we wait on Jehovah to resolve issues in his two-time, in his way.

00:18:11.819 --> 00:18:18.819
Yes, from all three of these accounts, and from other accounts that we don't have time to analyze tonight,

00:18:18.819 --> 00:18:22.819
we learn that the big issue is Jehovah's purpose.

00:18:22.819 --> 00:18:27.819
Now, it's true we could locate other Bible accounts that,

00:18:27.819 --> 00:18:31.819
well, where Jehovah did preserve his people, spared them from calamity,

00:18:31.819 --> 00:18:34.819
and it did not seem to directly relate to his purpose.

00:18:34.819 --> 00:18:38.819
But those seemed to be the exception, not the rule.

00:18:38.819 --> 00:18:42.819
For the most part, Jehovah's ancient servants had to live through

00:18:42.819 --> 00:18:48.819
an endure in justice, oppression, difficult circumstances in the home,

00:18:48.819 --> 00:18:53.819
health problems, and hardships, even heartaches.

00:18:53.819 --> 00:18:58.819
Jehovah's servants had to endure them, and so it is today.

00:18:59.819 --> 00:19:05.819
We do not expect Jehovah to shield us from all difficulties in this system.

00:19:05.819 --> 00:19:08.819
Rather, we remain faithful through the hardships.

00:19:08.819 --> 00:19:12.819
We remind ourselves that Jehovah's purpose is the big issue,

00:19:12.819 --> 00:19:15.819
and everything else is secondary at best.

00:19:15.819 --> 00:19:23.819
Even our eternal salvation is secondary to the vindication of Jehovah's sovereignty.

00:19:24.819 --> 00:19:32.819
And our eternal salvation is also secondary to the sanctification of God's name.

00:19:32.819 --> 00:19:34.819
It's not new light.

00:19:34.819 --> 00:19:38.819
It's one of the first things we learned when we got the truth,

00:19:38.819 --> 00:19:43.819
but it's an important reminder we need to give ourselves on occasion,

00:19:43.819 --> 00:19:46.819
because it is key to answering that question.

00:19:46.819 --> 00:19:50.819
Why is Jehovah permitting my human suffering?

00:19:51.819 --> 00:19:56.819
Not because you displeased him, not because you lost his favor,

00:19:56.819 --> 00:20:00.819
but because you're upholding Jehovah's sovereignty by your integrity

00:20:00.819 --> 00:20:04.819
and Jehovah treasures your faithfulness.

00:20:04.819 --> 00:20:10.799
Well, let's move on to our second question.

00:20:10.799 --> 00:20:15.799
Does this great importance of Jehovah's sovereignty render us unimportant to Jehovah?

00:20:15.799 --> 00:20:21.799
Does it mean that he's calloused to our sufferings insensitive to our feelings?

00:20:21.799 --> 00:20:24.799
Not in the least.

00:20:24.799 --> 00:20:28.799
Jehovah was very sensitive to Abraham's feelings,

00:20:28.799 --> 00:20:32.799
even blessing Ishmael on Abraham's account.

00:20:32.799 --> 00:20:35.799
And Jehovah was very sensitive to Sarah.

00:20:35.799 --> 00:20:40.799
He loved her and dignified her as the mother of the promised offspring.

00:20:40.799 --> 00:20:50.799
And what tender regard Jehovah showed for Jacob by arranging for him to be reunited with Joseph for many years.

00:20:50.799 --> 00:20:54.799
Jehovah is sensitive to your feelings too.

00:20:54.799 --> 00:20:59.799
What though about that statement that we made just moments ago

00:20:59.799 --> 00:21:07.799
that our eternal salvation is secondary to Jehovah's vindication and sanctification?

00:21:07.799 --> 00:21:11.799
Does that statement belittle our salvation?

00:21:11.799 --> 00:21:15.799
Does it render our salvation unimportant?

00:21:15.799 --> 00:21:18.799
Does it put our salvation at risk?

00:21:18.799 --> 00:21:23.799
As if to suggest, well, should the day ever come when Jehovah has to choose between vindication and salvation,

00:21:23.799 --> 00:21:25.799
we're all going to lose.

00:21:25.799 --> 00:21:27.799
Well, of course it doesn't mean that.

00:21:27.799 --> 00:21:30.799
But let's explain.

00:21:30.799 --> 00:21:36.799
In his great love, Jehovah has deliberately arranged matters

00:21:36.799 --> 00:21:44.799
so that the eternal salvation of faithful humans is part of the vindication of his sovereignty

00:21:44.799 --> 00:21:47.799
and the sanctification of his name.

00:21:47.799 --> 00:21:51.799
So let me repeat that because it's fundamental to this point.

00:21:51.799 --> 00:22:05.799
Jehovah has deliberately arranged matters so that the salvation of obedient humans is part of his vindication and salvation.

00:22:05.799 --> 00:22:09.799
Now, so let's read 2 Peter 3.

00:22:09.799 --> 00:22:14.529
We read this during the Watchtower study.

00:22:14.529 --> 00:22:17.529
We're going to look at a different aspect of it just now.

00:22:17.529 --> 00:22:25.769
2 Peter 3.13 says, but there are new heavens and a new earth

00:22:25.769 --> 00:22:29.769
that we are awaiting according to his promise.

00:22:29.769 --> 00:22:33.769
And in these, righteousness is to dwell.

00:22:33.769 --> 00:22:39.769
So here we have one of numerous Bible verses that impress upon us

00:22:39.769 --> 00:22:45.769
that the eternal salvation of obedient humans into new heavens or new earth.

00:22:45.769 --> 00:22:48.769
That's a promise from Jehovah.

00:22:48.769 --> 00:22:52.769
This isn't something that he mentions in passing or casually.

00:22:52.769 --> 00:22:55.769
It's a promise.

00:22:55.769 --> 00:23:01.769
And so our question, would Jehovah's name be sanctified

00:23:01.769 --> 00:23:06.769
if having made these promises, Jehovah was to be little salvation

00:23:06.769 --> 00:23:09.769
by failing to bring it about?

00:23:09.769 --> 00:23:13.769
Would that sanctified Jehovah's name?

00:23:13.769 --> 00:23:15.769
Wouldn't it really have the opposite effect?

00:23:15.769 --> 00:23:20.769
Justifying the devil and reproaching God's name by calling God a liar?

00:23:20.769 --> 00:23:23.769
Wouldn't it provide ammunition for these opposers who say,

00:23:23.769 --> 00:23:25.769
where's this promise presence of his?

00:23:25.769 --> 00:23:27.769
See, there it is.

00:23:27.769 --> 00:23:34.769
Jehovah has deliberately arranged matters so that salvation,

00:23:34.769 --> 00:23:40.769
the eternal salvation of obedient humans is part of the sanctification of his name.

00:23:40.769 --> 00:23:44.769
You could say that Jehovah has put salvation in a very safe place

00:23:44.769 --> 00:23:50.769
because it's part of the sanctification of his name.

00:23:50.769 --> 00:23:55.769
It is also part of the vindication of his sovereignty.

00:23:55.769 --> 00:24:03.079
So salvation is something that Jehovah cares about very much.

00:24:03.079 --> 00:24:06.079
He cares about our salvation.

00:24:06.079 --> 00:24:08.079
Why? Because he loves us so much.

00:24:08.079 --> 00:24:10.079
Nobody loves us like Jehovah.

00:24:10.079 --> 00:24:13.079
Not our parents, not our friends, not our mates.

00:24:13.079 --> 00:24:17.079
No one loves us like Jehovah.

00:24:17.079 --> 00:24:20.079
But all that love from Jehovah,

00:24:20.079 --> 00:24:24.079
the tender regard he has for each of his human servants,

00:24:24.079 --> 00:24:27.079
that desire he has to listen to our prayers

00:24:27.079 --> 00:24:31.079
and to bless us beyond anything we could ever deserve,

00:24:31.079 --> 00:24:36.079
all that love from Jehovah is part of his sovereignty.

00:24:36.079 --> 00:24:38.079
It's part of the way he rules.

00:24:38.079 --> 00:24:42.079
It's part of the very sovereignty that he's vindicating.

00:24:42.079 --> 00:24:43.079
Here's the point.

00:24:43.079 --> 00:24:47.079
The importance of Jehovah's sovereignty does not render us

00:24:47.079 --> 00:24:50.079
or our salvation unimportant to him.

00:24:50.079 --> 00:24:55.079
In stating that our salvation is secondary to Jehovah's sanctification

00:24:55.079 --> 00:24:58.079
and vindication, we're not belittling salvation.

00:24:58.079 --> 00:25:03.079
We are simply keeping vindication and salvation in proper perspective

00:25:03.079 --> 00:25:06.079
and giving ourselves the important reminder

00:25:06.079 --> 00:25:11.079
that the vindication of Jehovah's sovereignty is the big issue.

00:25:11.079 --> 00:25:15.059
Let's move on.

00:25:15.059 --> 00:25:17.059
Our third question.

00:25:17.059 --> 00:25:23.059
How can we each support and uphold Jehovah's sovereignty?

00:25:23.059 --> 00:25:26.059
Well, we've already talked about one way, haven't we?

00:25:26.059 --> 00:25:27.059
By integrity.

00:25:27.059 --> 00:25:29.059
So let's talk about a second way.

00:25:29.059 --> 00:25:34.059
By maintaining joy in Bethel service.

00:25:34.059 --> 00:25:39.059
Or we could say maintaining joy in sacred service overall.

00:25:39.059 --> 00:25:44.759
Psalm 102 says serve Jehovah with rejoicing.

00:25:44.759 --> 00:25:49.759
Deuteronomy 712 says you must rejoice in all your undertakings.

00:25:49.759 --> 00:25:54.759
Nehemiah 810 says the joy of Jehovah is your stronghold.

00:25:54.759 --> 00:25:58.759
Peter, James, Paul, Jesus himself.

00:25:58.759 --> 00:26:03.759
Counseled Christians to rejoice even under difficult circumstances.

00:26:03.759 --> 00:26:06.759
The question is why?

00:26:06.759 --> 00:26:10.759
What is so important about joy?

00:26:10.759 --> 00:26:15.759
And what's it to do with the all-important issue of Jehovah's sovereignty?

00:26:15.759 --> 00:26:20.759
Well, one long time member of the Bethel family put it this way.

00:26:20.759 --> 00:26:24.759
So suppose Jehovah said to Satan about you

00:26:24.759 --> 00:26:27.759
or about another of his faithful servants,

00:26:27.759 --> 00:26:29.759
there is my faithful servant.

00:26:29.759 --> 00:26:33.759
He kept integrity to the end and Satan said, that's true.

00:26:34.759 --> 00:26:37.759
But he hated every minute of it.

00:26:37.759 --> 00:26:41.759
He was miserable all the time.

00:26:41.759 --> 00:26:45.759
What would that say about Jehovah's sovereignty?

00:26:45.759 --> 00:26:49.759
What would that say about Jehovah's way of ruling?

00:26:49.759 --> 00:26:53.579
Now it's true what we said earlier.

00:26:53.579 --> 00:26:55.579
We all pass through periods of time

00:26:55.579 --> 00:26:58.579
where we serve Jehovah with tears.

00:26:58.579 --> 00:27:00.579
And that's not because of Jehovah's way of ruling.

00:27:00.579 --> 00:27:03.579
That's because we live in the devil's world.

00:27:03.579 --> 00:27:05.579
So we serve with tears, at least we serve.

00:27:05.579 --> 00:27:07.579
We keep integrity, we're faithful.

00:27:07.579 --> 00:27:09.579
Jehovah loves us for that.

00:27:09.579 --> 00:27:10.579
He treasures it.

00:27:10.579 --> 00:27:13.579
He keeps our tears in his skin bottle.

00:27:13.579 --> 00:27:15.579
We go through those periods.

00:27:15.579 --> 00:27:19.579
But as a general pattern,

00:27:19.579 --> 00:27:23.579
we give the best answer and the best support to Jehovah's sovereignty

00:27:23.579 --> 00:27:26.579
if we learn to serve him with joy.

00:27:26.579 --> 00:27:32.579
Not just the natural joy that can be acquired from self-help

00:27:32.579 --> 00:27:36.579
or acquired by rising above adversity,

00:27:36.579 --> 00:27:38.579
but codly joy.

00:27:38.579 --> 00:27:40.579
The joy of Jehovah,

00:27:40.579 --> 00:27:43.579
the joy that comes from knowing we have his approval

00:27:43.579 --> 00:27:47.579
and from immersing ourselves in his service.

00:27:47.579 --> 00:27:49.579
So again, while in principle,

00:27:49.579 --> 00:27:51.579
we're talking about sacred service in general,

00:27:51.579 --> 00:27:55.579
since most of us here tonight are members of the Bethel family,

00:27:55.579 --> 00:27:56.579
regular or temporary,

00:27:56.579 --> 00:27:59.579
let's take a few minutes to discuss the question,

00:27:59.579 --> 00:28:06.579
how can we maintain joy in our Bethel service despite its challenges?

00:28:06.579 --> 00:28:09.579
Now some who have never served the Bethel might just shake their heads

00:28:09.579 --> 00:28:11.579
at a question like that and wonder,

00:28:11.579 --> 00:28:14.579
how could anybody serve in a happy place like this

00:28:14.579 --> 00:28:18.579
and not be joyful all the time?

00:28:18.579 --> 00:28:21.579
But we who serve here know,

00:28:21.579 --> 00:28:25.579
it's a happy place, joyful, no question.

00:28:25.579 --> 00:28:30.579
And yet our joy can be challenged in a variety of ways.

00:28:30.579 --> 00:28:35.119
Well, not only do we appreciate that,

00:28:35.119 --> 00:28:39.119
so do many brothers and sisters who used to serve at Bethel in the past.

00:28:39.119 --> 00:28:41.119
You must have had that experience.

00:28:41.119 --> 00:28:45.119
Yes, where you sit back with a brother, a sister,

00:28:45.119 --> 00:28:47.119
a couple who used to serve here,

00:28:47.119 --> 00:28:49.119
and you get to talking about Bethel,

00:28:49.119 --> 00:28:52.119
and they understand you completely.

00:28:52.119 --> 00:28:54.119
They remember they haven't forgotten.

00:28:54.119 --> 00:28:57.119
If you told them that you recently participated in a room bid,

00:28:57.119 --> 00:28:59.119
and you accidentally inverted the figures

00:28:59.119 --> 00:29:03.119
and obtained the worst room on that list,

00:29:03.119 --> 00:29:06.119
they would feel your pain.

00:29:06.119 --> 00:29:09.119
I think if you told them you cleaned a couple of hamburgers last week,

00:29:09.119 --> 00:29:11.119
they didn't know what that put you through.

00:29:11.119 --> 00:29:15.119
You risked your life for that food injury.

00:29:15.119 --> 00:29:18.119
But they would remember.

00:29:18.119 --> 00:29:21.119
Many years ago, I remember a member of the Bethel family telling me

00:29:21.119 --> 00:29:23.119
that in some respects,

00:29:23.119 --> 00:29:25.119
Bethel was more difficult than the many years

00:29:25.119 --> 00:29:29.119
they'd spent as prisoners in Germany during the Holocaust.

00:29:29.119 --> 00:29:35.490
Well, how was that statement meant to be understood?

00:29:35.490 --> 00:29:37.490
And what way could Bethel be harder?

00:29:37.490 --> 00:29:40.490
Here's how it was explained to me.

00:29:40.490 --> 00:29:43.490
As a prisoner, it was always easy to know

00:29:43.490 --> 00:29:46.490
what Jehovah wanted you to do.

00:29:46.490 --> 00:29:48.490
Sometimes it was difficult to do the right thing,

00:29:48.490 --> 00:29:52.490
but to know what the right thing was was simple.

00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:55.490
The issue was as clear as black and white.

00:29:55.490 --> 00:29:57.490
It was what today we would call a no-brainer,

00:29:57.490 --> 00:30:01.490
but at Bethel, facing things like,

00:30:01.490 --> 00:30:03.490
what does Jehovah want me to do?

00:30:03.490 --> 00:30:05.490
How does he want me to balance my work assignment

00:30:05.490 --> 00:30:07.490
with my field ministry,

00:30:07.490 --> 00:30:09.490
with my other congregation activity,

00:30:09.490 --> 00:30:12.490
with my personal study, my marriage,

00:30:12.490 --> 00:30:14.490
a time for necessary rest,

00:30:14.490 --> 00:30:16.490
seems like no matter how many different ways

00:30:16.490 --> 00:30:18.490
I try to balance it out,

00:30:18.490 --> 00:30:22.490
I'm always left feeling like something spiritual

00:30:22.490 --> 00:30:24.490
is being neglected.

00:30:24.490 --> 00:30:26.490
Well, all this to say,

00:30:26.490 --> 00:30:28.490
Bethel life has its challenges,

00:30:28.490 --> 00:30:33.490
and of course, most of the trials we face are more serious

00:30:33.490 --> 00:30:37.490
and painful than the ones we've described as examples.

00:30:37.490 --> 00:30:40.490
Some of our trials are large.

00:30:40.490 --> 00:30:43.490
Others are smaller, but significant.

00:30:43.490 --> 00:30:47.490
Some of our trials are common to all mankind.

00:30:47.490 --> 00:30:50.490
Others are unique to serving here,

00:30:50.490 --> 00:30:53.490
but it takes a spiritual person

00:30:53.490 --> 00:30:56.490
to make a success of Bethel service

00:30:56.490 --> 00:30:58.490
and to maintain joy,

00:30:58.490 --> 00:31:00.490
despite the challenges.

00:31:00.490 --> 00:31:02.490
Well, that just brings us right back to our question.

00:31:02.490 --> 00:31:04.490
How can we maintain joy at Bethel

00:31:04.490 --> 00:31:05.490
despite the challenges?

00:31:05.490 --> 00:31:13.799
Let's turn to Romans chapter 11.

00:31:13.799 --> 00:31:17.799
These inspired words that Romans 11-13 were Paul wrote,

00:31:17.799 --> 00:31:20.799
now I speak to you who are people of the nations

00:31:20.799 --> 00:31:23.799
seeing that I'm in a puzzle to the nations,

00:31:23.799 --> 00:31:27.799
I glorify my ministry.

00:31:27.799 --> 00:31:30.799
And now we ask,

00:31:30.799 --> 00:31:34.240
what ministry?

00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:37.240
What ministry did Paul glorify?

00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:40.240
To what ministry did he have reference

00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:42.240
to the ministry in general,

00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:44.240
the preaching and teaching work worldwide?

00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:45.240
No.

00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:48.240
In context, Paul had reference

00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:52.240
to his particular specific assignment

00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:55.240
within that great ministry.

00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:57.240
Paul was an apostle to the nations,

00:31:57.240 --> 00:32:01.240
and he treasured that assignment.

00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:04.240
He magnified it as the footnote says.

00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:07.240
He valued it as a high privilege.

00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:09.240
Not that he thought his assignment

00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:11.240
made him better than other Christians.

00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:13.240
Not that he looked down on others.

00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:16.240
Paul did not glorify himself,

00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:19.240
but he glorified his ministry.

00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:22.240
He made no apologies there.

00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:25.240
Paul did not view his ministry

00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:28.240
as an apostle to the nations as less honorable

00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:32.240
than say witnessing exclusively to Jews,

00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:35.240
something that Paul probably could have done very well,

00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:38.240
given his former history as a Pharisee.

00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:42.240
And Paul did not view his apostleship to the nations

00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:45.240
as less honorable than organizing the work globally

00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:49.240
from Jerusalem with the apostles and the older men there.

00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:54.240
He viewed his assignment as a privilege of the highest order.

00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:56.240
He learned to carry it out skillfully

00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:58.240
and to benefit others.

00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:01.240
Paul appreciated the supreme value of the assignment

00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:04.240
that he was given.

00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:08.240
And that's how we need to feel about our assignment,

00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:10.240
Bethel's service.

00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:12.240
As Paul glorified his ministry,

00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:15.240
we need to treasure our assignment.

00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:17.240
If you are serving here at Bethel,

00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:20.240
that is a special assignment.

00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:22.240
Treasure it, magnify it, don't minimize it,

00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:24.240
not even in your mind,

00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:27.710
because we will lose our joy,

00:33:27.710 --> 00:33:30.710
and we'll lose perspective.

00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:33.710
If we ever start to believe in our hearts,

00:33:33.710 --> 00:33:36.710
that Bethel's service is somehow less honorable,

00:33:36.710 --> 00:33:38.710
less important, less spiritual,

00:33:38.710 --> 00:33:42.710
than all those other full-time privileges out there.

00:33:43.710 --> 00:33:46.710
Now, of course, we know that each of us

00:33:46.710 --> 00:33:49.710
needs to have a personal share in the actual field service

00:33:49.710 --> 00:33:53.710
and other essential spiritual activity.

00:33:53.710 --> 00:33:55.710
And we want to.

00:33:55.710 --> 00:33:57.710
We have our heart in those things.

00:33:57.710 --> 00:34:00.710
But that should be a given.

00:34:00.710 --> 00:34:04.710
It remains that properly motivated our work here at Bethel

00:34:04.710 --> 00:34:07.710
is sacred full-time service.

00:34:07.710 --> 00:34:09.710
Whatever your specific assignment at Bethel,

00:34:09.710 --> 00:34:12.710
it is a special part of getting the good news-preached

00:34:12.710 --> 00:34:13.710
earth-wide.

00:34:13.710 --> 00:34:15.710
Here's the point.

00:34:15.710 --> 00:34:17.710
Bethel's service counts.

00:34:17.710 --> 00:34:19.710
That does mean we can count our Bethel time

00:34:19.710 --> 00:34:21.710
on a field service report.

00:34:21.710 --> 00:34:23.710
I already checked the new addition

00:34:23.710 --> 00:34:26.710
of the organized book.

00:34:26.710 --> 00:34:30.710
No, but reminding ourselves that Bethel's service

00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:34.710
is a spiritual privilege and treating it as such,

00:34:34.710 --> 00:34:36.710
that's key to maintaining joy.

00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:39.710
Joy that outweighs the challenges.

00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:44.710
Joy that coupled with integrity upholds Jehovah's

00:34:44.710 --> 00:34:45.710
sovereignty.

00:34:45.710 --> 00:34:51.659
Now, some have voiced the concern,

00:34:51.659 --> 00:34:56.659
how can I have joy in my specific Bethel assignment?

00:34:56.659 --> 00:35:00.659
And why remind myself of how important it is

00:35:00.659 --> 00:35:03.659
when at any given time in the future,

00:35:03.659 --> 00:35:07.659
for all I know, I might receive a different assignment

00:35:07.659 --> 00:35:11.659
outside of Bethel or inside job change.

00:35:11.659 --> 00:35:16.659
And it's a big subject, but just in the context of this talk,

00:35:16.659 --> 00:35:19.659
we've discussed how Jehovah dealt with Abraham,

00:35:19.659 --> 00:35:22.659
Sarah, Jacob,

00:35:22.659 --> 00:35:27.659
and how Jehovah did not tell them everything.

00:35:27.659 --> 00:35:32.659
They served Jehovah with what he had disclosed to them,

00:35:32.659 --> 00:35:36.659
confident that he would take care of their yet uncertain future.

00:35:36.659 --> 00:35:38.659
Now, that's the way Jehovah works.

00:35:38.659 --> 00:35:41.659
Even perfect Adam and Eve were not told everything

00:35:41.659 --> 00:35:44.659
that Jehovah had in mind for them and for the earth.

00:35:44.659 --> 00:35:47.659
They were basically told this is your assignment for now.

00:35:47.659 --> 00:35:49.659
And so it is with us.

00:35:49.659 --> 00:35:53.659
Jehovah does not tell us everything.

00:35:53.659 --> 00:35:55.659
Yes, he tells the outcome from the beginning

00:35:55.659 --> 00:35:57.659
when it has to do with his purpose,

00:35:57.659 --> 00:36:01.659
but he does not tell you or me what we will be doing

00:36:01.659 --> 00:36:05.659
and how we will be serving him next year,

00:36:05.659 --> 00:36:09.659
the following year, or the year after that.

00:36:09.659 --> 00:36:12.659
That is not how Jehovah deals with us.

00:36:12.659 --> 00:36:15.659
It is not how he gives us joy.

00:36:15.659 --> 00:36:18.659
It is not how he gives us his peace.

00:36:18.659 --> 00:36:21.659
How does he do it then?

00:36:21.659 --> 00:36:24.659
Well, rather than making our joy dependent

00:36:24.659 --> 00:36:27.659
on a certain job assignment or type of work or privilege,

00:36:27.659 --> 00:36:30.659
Jehovah wants us to look to him for joy

00:36:30.659 --> 00:36:34.659
on our current assignments as we serve him a day at a time.

00:36:34.659 --> 00:36:39.659
Psalm 37.4 says, find exquisite delight in Jehovah.

00:36:39.659 --> 00:36:45.659
Footnote says, find your greatest joy in Jehovah.

00:36:45.659 --> 00:36:48.659
That's the way Jehovah gives us joy.

00:36:48.659 --> 00:36:53.659
And it is the only way to maintain joy in sacred service,

00:36:53.659 --> 00:36:56.659
any form of sacred service.

00:36:56.659 --> 00:37:00.659
Now it also means we need to do like Psalm 73.26 says,

00:37:00.659 --> 00:37:06.659
make Jehovah the rock of our heart, the source of our emotional stability.

00:37:06.659 --> 00:37:10.659
It's natural for us to feel apprehensive for our future,

00:37:10.659 --> 00:37:15.659
especially in a climate of rapid change.

00:37:15.659 --> 00:37:18.659
I don't think any of us are immune to these feelings,

00:37:18.659 --> 00:37:21.659
but if we give into uncontrolled worry,

00:37:21.659 --> 00:37:26.659
we will not only suffer emotionally and maybe physically too,

00:37:27.659 --> 00:37:32.659
but more important, we'll miss an opportunity to make Jehovah our reason

00:37:32.659 --> 00:37:34.659
for feeling secure and safe.

00:37:34.659 --> 00:37:37.659
And we can't afford to miss an opportunity to do that.

00:37:37.659 --> 00:37:38.659
Why not?

00:37:38.659 --> 00:37:40.659
Why do we need to seize every opportunity

00:37:40.659 --> 00:37:44.659
to practice making Jehovah our confidence?

00:37:44.659 --> 00:37:49.659
Because at some point, every one of us of the other sheep

00:37:49.659 --> 00:37:53.659
will be either at the brink of Armageddon or in the grave

00:37:53.659 --> 00:37:58.659
and in either situation, only Jehovah can save us.

00:37:58.659 --> 00:38:00.659
And he will.

00:38:00.659 --> 00:38:05.659
But we need to use every opportunity now to make him our reason

00:38:05.659 --> 00:38:08.659
for feeling safe, stable and secure.

00:38:08.659 --> 00:38:14.659
We need to make our personal tie with Jehovah stronger than anything else.

00:38:14.659 --> 00:38:16.659
Here's the point.

00:38:16.659 --> 00:38:19.659
Let's treasure our Bethel service.

00:38:19.659 --> 00:38:23.659
Let's find joy in our specific assignments,

00:38:23.659 --> 00:38:27.659
but let's make Jehovah our refuge.

00:38:27.659 --> 00:38:32.659
With Jehovah is our strength and an imitation of the Apostle Paul.

00:38:32.659 --> 00:38:36.659
We can glorify and magnify any aspect of the ministry

00:38:36.659 --> 00:38:41.510
to which we may be assigned.

00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:42.510
Well, it's been a lot of words.

00:38:42.510 --> 00:38:44.510
Can we summarize this talk?

00:38:44.510 --> 00:38:47.510
I won't say in one word or less.

00:38:55.519 --> 00:38:58.519
Can we summarize this talk in a sentence?

00:38:58.519 --> 00:39:01.519
A long sentence.

00:39:01.519 --> 00:39:02.519
Maybe this way.

00:39:02.519 --> 00:39:06.519
Whenever we get to wondering why is Jehovah permitting my human suffering,

00:39:06.519 --> 00:39:09.519
we can give ourselves an important reminder to view matters

00:39:09.519 --> 00:39:13.519
in the light of Jehovah's purpose to vindicate his sovereignty,

00:39:13.519 --> 00:39:18.519
which we support by our integrity and joyful service.

00:39:18.519 --> 00:39:23.519
Now, a final point in conclusion.

00:39:25.829 --> 00:39:27.829
Let's not forget that Jehovah's permission

00:39:27.829 --> 00:39:29.829
of human suffering is temporary

00:39:29.829 --> 00:39:33.829
and that he will abundantly reward those who uphold his sovereignty.

00:39:33.829 --> 00:39:38.829
But meditating on the reward can help us to remain faithful

00:39:38.829 --> 00:39:40.829
and to maintain joy.

00:39:40.829 --> 00:39:45.829
Some to whom we preach find the new world hard to believe.

00:39:45.829 --> 00:39:48.829
To them, it's too good to be true.

00:39:48.829 --> 00:39:53.829
Just a fantasy that's not worth wasting time dreaming about it.

00:39:53.829 --> 00:39:57.829
But when you know the truth, isn't it so?

00:39:57.829 --> 00:40:00.829
This is the world that's hard to believe.

00:40:00.829 --> 00:40:04.110
We believe it only because we're here.

00:40:04.110 --> 00:40:05.110
We can't deny it.

00:40:05.110 --> 00:40:07.110
It's all too real to us.

00:40:07.110 --> 00:40:09.110
But imagine yourself describing this world

00:40:09.110 --> 00:40:13.110
to someone born in the paradise earth.

00:40:13.110 --> 00:40:17.110
What might that person say to you in return?

00:40:17.110 --> 00:40:19.110
Maybe something like this.

00:40:19.110 --> 00:40:21.110
Are you sure you're not exaggerating?

00:40:21.110 --> 00:40:24.110
Could it have been as bad as you described?

00:40:24.110 --> 00:40:31.110
How could anyone live every day under such stressful circumstances?

00:40:31.110 --> 00:40:33.110
Conceivably.

00:40:33.110 --> 00:40:35.110
Someone might say something like that

00:40:35.110 --> 00:40:38.110
because this is the world that's hard to believe.

00:40:38.110 --> 00:40:42.110
Jehovah's promised new world will simply be normal.

00:40:42.110 --> 00:40:47.110
Really, everything about it, the endless life, the vibrant health,

00:40:47.110 --> 00:40:51.110
the pleasant associations, the uninhibited relationship with Jehovah.

00:40:51.110 --> 00:40:53.110
All that is normal.

00:40:53.110 --> 00:40:58.519
That is the life for which we're designed.

00:40:58.519 --> 00:41:02.519
And that is the life that Jehovah promises

00:41:02.519 --> 00:41:05.519
to those who uphold his sovereignty.

00:41:05.519 --> 00:41:08.519
Now, Satan says he has something better.

00:41:08.519 --> 00:41:10.519
Come under my sovereignty, he says,

00:41:10.519 --> 00:41:13.519
I will let you design your own moral code.

00:41:13.519 --> 00:41:16.519
You'll be happier, really?

00:41:16.519 --> 00:41:18.519
Even if Satan could do it,

00:41:18.519 --> 00:41:21.519
and he can't come close to what Jehovah is going to accomplish.

00:41:21.519 --> 00:41:24.519
But just for the sake of our increment,

00:41:24.519 --> 00:41:26.519
if he could do it, if he could match it,

00:41:26.519 --> 00:41:29.519
if he could produce a world without sorrow,

00:41:29.519 --> 00:41:32.519
without sickness, without death.

00:41:32.519 --> 00:41:36.519
It would still be a world without Jehovah.

00:41:36.519 --> 00:41:39.519
And lovers of Jehovah find that offensive.

00:41:39.519 --> 00:41:41.519
We don't want it.

00:41:41.519 --> 00:41:43.519
We want Jehovah ruling over us.

00:41:43.519 --> 00:41:46.519
We want God's sovereignty.

00:41:46.519 --> 00:41:48.519
And we show it now

00:41:48.519 --> 00:41:52.519
by our integrity and joyful service.

00:41:52.519 --> 00:41:54.519
So let us as often as necessary

00:41:54.519 --> 00:41:56.519
give ourselves this important reminder

00:41:56.519 --> 00:41:59.519
now is the time to support the big issue

00:41:59.519 --> 00:42:01.519
Jehovah's sovereignty.
