00:00:01.139 --> 00:00:07.860
One benefit to reading God's word is that it allows us to see a full range of Jehovah's feelings and

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.140
reactions when it comes to the conduct and actions of his servants and others.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.500
For example, the Bible describes Jehovah as being grieved and

00:00:18.899 --> 00:00:21.460
saddened toward the wickedness in Noah's day.

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.460
He felt compassion for a lot.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
And when speaking about his son,

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.539
the study note to Matthew chapter 3 verse 17 says,

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:37.219
Jesus was one with whom God was well pleased in whom he took great delight.

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:45.299
If we look at the other end of the spectrum with the nation of Israel, for example, at times the Bible says,

00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:50.579
Jehovah's anger flared or he was very angry with them.

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.340
But when it comes to Solomon,

00:00:55.299 --> 00:01:01.460
how does the Bible describe Jehovah's reaction to Solomon breaking the law mentioned in today's text?

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:11.489
Turn with me, pleasing your Bibles to first Kings chapter 11 and we get the answer in first Kings chapter 11

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:19.150
verses 9 and 10.

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.150
There it says

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.989
Jehovah became

00:01:22.989 --> 00:01:28.909
furious at Solomon because his heart had inclined away from Jehovah the God of Israel.

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:36.349
Who had appeared to him twice and had warned him about this very thing that he should not go after other gods.

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:40.590
But he did not obey what Jehovah had commanded.

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.870
Can you imagine Jehovah being furious at us for something we had said or done?

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.109
Of course, we recognize when the Bible speaks about Jehovah being angry or furious,

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:58.030
these feelings are always expressed in a controlled manner.

00:01:58.989 --> 00:02:03.230
The inside book states that God's anger is always justified,

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.310
does not stem from a momentary whim to be later regretted,

00:02:08.189 --> 00:02:15.469
and is always under control and in harmony with the attributes of love, wisdom, and justice.

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.349
So with that in mind, why did Jehovah react the way he did towards Solomon?

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:25.469
Let's go back to verse 9.

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:31.870
Verse 9 says that Jehovah appeared to Solomon twice.

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:36.909
The first time is mentioned in first Kings chapter 3.

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.590
Their Solomon was at the start of his kingship and Jehovah appears to him in a dream and

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.270
invites him to make a request.

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:51.870
Verses 7 through 9, Solomon acknowledges his young, inexperienced, so he requests wisdom.

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.189
And we know what happened.

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:00.430
Jehovah blesses him for his thought process, he gives him a wise and understanding heart,

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.310
and then he generously adds prosperity and wealth.

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:13.629
But Jehovah also outlines for Solomon a path, a path to help him remain successful.

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:18.110
No verse 14 of chapter 3, he said,

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:24.430
And if you walk in my ways by keeping my regulations and my commandments

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:30.750
just as David your father walked, I will also give you a long life.

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:33.710
Very loving on Jehovah's part.

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:37.789
Interestingly, if you look at verse 1,

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:45.629
prior to Jehovah appearing to Solomon, Solomon had already taken a foreign wife

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:47.710
by Mary and Pharaoh's daughter.

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.150
And yet, there's no indication that Jehovah turned away from him,

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:58.669
that he abandoned him, quickly rejected him as king, or strongly disciplined him.

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:01.550
Now you think about that.

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:06.430
Once Jehovah granted Solomon with the wisdom he requested,

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:13.949
do you think Solomon ever reflected on his actions and realized he was a recipient of Jehovah's

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:22.910
mercy? Did that ever cause him to dig deeper into God's word, to try to find ways to apply

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:29.230
what he learned from that point forward? We know that there were periods of Solomon's life where

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:36.079
he did follow God's laws and regulations, and Jehovah blessed him, but he wasn't consistent.

00:04:37.439 --> 00:04:43.759
He couldn't maintain it. Could he have rationalized that there were some things in the law that

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:49.579
just didn't apply to him? Well, is there a lesson for us?

00:04:51.579 --> 00:04:58.300
Can we think of a time or times when Jehovah has appeared to us, figuratively speaking?

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:06.860
Maybe like Solomon, we were inexperienced in some way. Perhaps we showed poor judgment on a matter,

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:10.139
or something caused us to develop a negative attitude.

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:16.699
And then we heard a nice point at a congregation meeting. We came across something in our personal

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:23.980
study. Were perhaps in the spirit of Galatians 6.1, someone showed loving concern, brought the

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:31.180
matter to our attention, and then from the scriptures outlined a path for us that would help us to be

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:35.980
successful. Is that your Holbo can bring matters to our attention in any number of ways?

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:46.480
But what is our response? How will his feelings be affected? With all of the direction and

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:51.839
admonition we get, it could be easy at times to rationalize that there are some things that

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:59.680
just don't apply to us, or even justify in our minds that something is not as bad as Jehovah says it

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:05.920
is. Well, certainly Solomon's example shows us that that kind of thinking can be deceptive,

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:13.759
and could lead us into a gradual departure from God's requirements. Why can we say that?

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:21.680
Let's look at the second time Jehovah appeared to Solomon. That's in 1 Kings 9.

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:27.680
At this point Solomon has completed the building of the temple and other building projects.

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:34.399
So this is likely 20 years later from when Jehovah first appeared to Solomon. So Solomon is not a

00:06:34.399 --> 00:06:42.000
young king anymore. At this point, he's experienced, he's seasoned, he's accomplished, and when

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:48.079
Jehovah appears to him, he indicates that he has not forgotten Solomon. He's still with him. He

00:06:48.079 --> 00:06:55.040
has not forgotten Solomon's temple inauguration prayer years earlier, and then in verses 4 through 9,

00:06:55.600 --> 00:07:02.399
he again reminds Solomon of the need to stay faithful, just as his father David had done.

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:07.439
But he also gives the warning. If Solomon and the people chose not to obey,

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:12.879
Jehovah warned that they would be cut off, and he would bring calamity upon them.

00:07:14.639 --> 00:07:21.439
How would Solomon respond this time? Sometimes when we're older, the longer we live,

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:28.800
the more likely we are to reflect on our lives. Do you think Solomon did that at this point?

00:07:29.759 --> 00:07:35.439
Do you think Solomon ever wondered why does Jehovah keep bringing this matter to my attention?

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:43.199
Did he ever reflect on why Jehovah loved his father David so much, and then looked for ways to

00:07:43.199 --> 00:07:50.800
imitate his example? What was evident was that Solomon became complacent in his worship,

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:57.600
and he took one fall step after another. Mary and one pagan wife was bad enough,

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:03.759
but when all was said and done, 700 wives, many of who were pagan,

00:08:04.639 --> 00:08:10.079
300 concubines, following other gods, establishing high places for false worship.

00:08:11.519 --> 00:08:17.040
You see Solomon took disobedience and disregard for Jehovah's laws to another level.

00:08:18.319 --> 00:08:24.480
So taking all of this into account, can we understand why Jehovah felt the way he did,

00:08:25.439 --> 00:08:28.800
and why his fury towards Solomon was justified?

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:38.720
How can this Bible account help us? It should help us to be determined not to become complacent

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:45.519
in our worship. Solomon's actions were not casual mistakes. This was a progressive,

00:08:46.159 --> 00:08:53.039
sinking into disobedience. So may we you and I be sensitive to Jehovah's direction,

00:08:53.039 --> 00:08:57.840
be sensitive to his reminders, look for ways that we can make practical application

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:04.720
of what he says in our life. We can also use this account to hide and strengthen our appreciation

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:10.799
for Jehovah's love and mercy. Whether we're relatively new in the truth or we've been serving Jehovah

00:09:10.799 --> 00:09:18.559
for decades, our imperfection may cause us to make mistakes from time to time, to do things that

00:09:18.559 --> 00:09:25.250
may disappoint Jehovah, possibly even anger him. But here's a comforting thought.

00:09:26.769 --> 00:09:36.850
Anger is not a dominant quality of Jehovah. He's a happy God, slow to anger, abundant in loving

00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:43.330
kindness. And when he sees that we're putting forth the effort to fear him, we just think of how

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:50.289
that makes him feel and how that magnifies his name. He really is a sobering thought that

00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:57.649
as insignificant imperfect humans, you and I can do things to move or affect the feelings

00:09:58.450 --> 00:10:07.490
of the highest personage in the universe for good or for bad. Well, may those things we do always

00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:15.250
be for good so that Jehovah can feel about us the way that he did his son, that we are ones with whom

00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:24.610
God is well pleased and brings joy to his heart.
