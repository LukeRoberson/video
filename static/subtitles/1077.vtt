00:00:01.389 --> 00:00:05.389
Have you experienced an unexpected financial setback?

00:00:05.389 --> 00:00:08.390
Is your child struggling to resist peer pressure

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:11.390
or unwholesome influences from the Internet?

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:15.390
Have you been diagnosed with a life-threatening disease?

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:19.390
Life in this wicked system can seem like a dark wilderness

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.390
that we may feel alone discouraged

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.390
and we just don't know where to turn.

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.390
This is why more than ever,

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.390
we need to strengthen our faith in God's Word.

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.390
When we study the Bible and take it to heart,

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.390
our faith in God grows and something amazing happens.

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.390
Let's find out what that is.

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.390
First Thessalonians chapter 2, and let's read verse 13.

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.390
First Thessalonians 2, 13.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:51.390
Indeed, that is why we also thank God unceasingly

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.390
because when you received God's Word,

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.390
which you heard from us,

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.390
you accepted it not as the Word of men,

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.390
but just as it truthfully is as the Word of God,

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.390
which is also at work in new believers.

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.390
How does God's Word work in us?

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.390
It has already transformed us into faithful servants of Jehovah God,

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.390
but it also gives us the power to remain strong

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.390
under difficult circumstances.

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.390
This subject is timely because we live in a world

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.390
where so many plant seeds have doubt about the Bible.

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.390
They say it is something outdated or inaccurate.

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.390
It is our determination not to allow the world's mistaken views

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.390
to erode our faith in the Bible.

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.390
In this talk, we're going to look at three proofs

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.390
to help us maintain our love and confidence in God's inspired Word.

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.390
It's prophecies, what it says about the earth,

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.390
and it's survival against all odds.

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.390
Let's take the first point, Bible prophecies.

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:09.389
Beyond man's reach is the ability to foresee the future in detail.

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:11.389
Only Almighty God can do this.

00:02:11.389 --> 00:02:17.389
For example, secular history tells us that in the year 539 BCE,

00:02:17.389 --> 00:02:21.389
a man named Cyrus conquered the land of Babylon

00:02:21.389 --> 00:02:24.389
and allowed thousands of Jewish captives to return home

00:02:24.389 --> 00:02:27.389
to restore true worship in Jerusalem.

00:02:27.389 --> 00:02:30.389
The Bible also tells us about these events

00:02:30.389 --> 00:02:33.389
with one notable exception.

00:02:33.389 --> 00:02:38.389
While secular history recounts these events after they happened,

00:02:38.389 --> 00:02:42.389
the Bible foretold these events before they took place.

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:45.389
In fact, some 200 years before.

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:48.389
Let's take a closer look and see for ourselves.

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:52.389
Let's turn to Isaiah, chapter 44.

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:58.389
Isaiah, chapter 44, and we're going to read verses 27 and 28.

00:02:58.389 --> 00:03:00.389
And as we read these verses,

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:09.310
please take special notice of how many times the Word will appear.

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.310
The one saying to the deep waters, be evaporated,

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.310
and I will dry up your rivers.

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.310
The one saying of Cyrus, he is my shepherd,

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.310
and he will completely carry out all my will.

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.310
The one saying of Jerusalem, she will be rebuilt,

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.310
and of the temple, your foundation will be laid.

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.310
This isn't Jehovah God just guessing

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.310
or trying to figure out the future.

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.310
He's decided what will happen and he will make it happen.

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.310
How could the Bible predict this kind of detail

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.310
some 200 years in advance?

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.310
There is only one explanation.

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.310
Turn a couple of chapters over to Isaiah, chapter 46,

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.979
and let's read verse 10.

00:03:59.979 --> 00:04:02.979
From the beginning, I foretell the outcome.

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:06.979
And from long ago, the things that have not yet been done.

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:10.979
I say, my decision will stand,

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:14.979
and I will do whatever I please.

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:18.980
It's fulfilled prophecies like these

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:23.980
that build trust and confidence in God's Word.

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:26.980
Now another reason we have faith in the Bible

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.980
is because of what it says about the earth.

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:33.980
Let's consider an example at Job, chapter 26,

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.980
and let's read verse 7.

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:42.699
Job, chapter 26, and verse 7.

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:46.699
He stretches out the northern sky over empty space,

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:51.699
suspending the earth upon nothing.

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:56.699
Now this was stated some 3,500 years ago.

00:04:56.699 --> 00:04:59.699
Job statement would have appeared ridiculous

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:01.699
to the Greek philosopher, Aristotle,

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:04.699
who taught that an object must rest upon

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:07.699
or be attached to something or else it will fall.

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:10.699
It was not until 1687

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:13.699
that the scientist Isaac Newton explained

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:17.699
that the earth is held in orbit by an invisible force

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:21.699
appearing as if it were suspended on nothing.

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:23.699
Now how did the Bible know the truth

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:25.699
more than 3,000 years ago?

00:05:25.699 --> 00:05:27.699
The answer,

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:29.699
it is the Word of God,

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:32.699
and God cannot lie.

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:35.699
Let's take our third line of evidence,

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:39.699
and that is the Bible's survival.

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:42.699
Although the original books of the Bible have disappeared,

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:45.699
accurate copies of the Bible manuscripts

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:47.699
have survived to our day,

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:50.699
despite natural decay, fierce opposition,

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:53.699
and deliberate tampering with its message.

00:05:53.699 --> 00:05:56.699
Isaiah chapter 40 in verse 8 tells us,

00:05:56.699 --> 00:05:58.699
the Word of our God,

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:01.699
endures forever.

00:06:01.699 --> 00:06:03.699
The Bible has not endured,

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:05.699
as a mere museum display,

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:07.699
its message has endured.

00:06:07.699 --> 00:06:10.699
That inspired message has been conveyed

00:06:10.699 --> 00:06:12.699
in over 3,000 languages.

00:06:12.699 --> 00:06:17.699
This is irrefutable proof of its divine origin.

00:06:17.699 --> 00:06:21.699
The following video presents additional evidence

00:06:21.699 --> 00:06:24.699
that the Bible is God's Word.

00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:26.699
Please pay attention to this.

00:06:26.699 --> 00:06:32.680
The Bible is a book of facts.

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:34.680
It's about real people,

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:37.680
real events, real history, and real places.

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.680
In the Hebrew scriptures,

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:44.680
there are at least 53 people confirmed archaeologically.

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:48.680
One example is Pharaoh Shishak of Egypt.

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:51.680
The Bible mentions his invasion of Judah,

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.680
specifically dating it

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:57.680
in the fifth year of Judean king Rehupua.

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:59.680
For a long time,

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.680
the only record of that invasion

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:04.680
was the one found in the Bible.

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:07.680
Then, a relief on the wall of a temple

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:09.680
at Karnak, Egypt, was discovered,

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:13.680
depicting Shishak with captives.

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:17.680
It also records names of conquered Israelite towns,

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:21.680
many of which have been identified with biblical sites.

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:25.680
It also mentions the field of Abram,

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:28.680
the earliest reference in Egyptian records

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:32.680
to the biblical patriarch Abram.

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:35.680
This strengthens our confidence in faith

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:38.680
in the Bible as God's Word.

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:41.680
The Bible was written on perishable materials,

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:44.680
such as papyrus and parchment.

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:47.680
While no originals are known to exist today,

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:50.680
the number of ancient copies available now

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:52.680
is staggering,

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:55.680
some 11,000 Hebrew and Greek manuscripts,

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:59.680
more than for any other ancient piece of literature.

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:02.680
By comparing the earliest,

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:04.680
most authoritative manuscripts,

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:07.680
scholars can identify inaccuracies

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:10.680
and mistakes that have crept in.

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:13.680
But the vast majority of differences

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:16.680
do not change the meaning at all.

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:18.680
One example is found at Luke 417,

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:23.680
which says that Jesus opened the skull of Isaiah.

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:28.680
But some manuscripts say that he unrolled the skull.

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:32.679
But isn't the meaning the same?

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:36.679
God's message has even survived changes in language.

00:08:36.679 --> 00:08:39.679
Writers of the Christian Greek scriptures

00:08:39.679 --> 00:08:41.679
quoted the Hebrew scriptures,

00:08:41.679 --> 00:08:44.679
but often from the Greek Septuric translation.

00:08:44.679 --> 00:08:47.679
At times, they paraphrased such quotations

00:08:47.679 --> 00:08:49.679
using slightly different wording,

00:08:49.679 --> 00:08:52.679
but the message remained the same.

00:08:52.679 --> 00:08:54.679
And most of Jesus' words,

00:08:54.679 --> 00:08:56.679
likely spoken in 1st century Hebrew,

00:08:56.679 --> 00:08:59.679
were recorded in Greek.

00:08:59.679 --> 00:09:02.679
Still, his message is clear.

00:09:02.679 --> 00:09:05.679
Today, at least parts of God's word

00:09:05.679 --> 00:09:09.679
can be read in more than 3,000 languages.

00:09:09.679 --> 00:09:13.679
The Bible's survival reveals a puzzling paradox.

00:09:13.679 --> 00:09:16.679
Throughout history, people were willing to die

00:09:16.679 --> 00:09:20.679
to preserve the Bible and make it available to everyone.

00:09:20.679 --> 00:09:22.679
Others were willing to kill,

00:09:22.679 --> 00:09:26.679
to prevent access to it and wipe it out of existence.

00:09:26.679 --> 00:09:27.679
Why?

00:09:27.679 --> 00:09:29.679
It's the book's content.

00:09:29.679 --> 00:09:31.679
God's word is alive,

00:09:31.679 --> 00:09:33.679
and exerts power.

00:09:33.679 --> 00:09:37.679
It changes people's lives in ways that some welcome,

00:09:37.679 --> 00:09:41.679
but others resist violently at times.

00:09:41.679 --> 00:09:45.679
For example, responding to Roman Emperor Diocletians

00:09:45.679 --> 00:09:48.679
edict in 3 or 3 CE

00:09:48.679 --> 00:09:51.679
to destroy the sacred scriptures by fire,

00:09:51.679 --> 00:09:55.679
Felix, the bishop of Tibyuka, reportedly said,

00:09:55.679 --> 00:09:59.679
it is better for me to be burned than the sacred scriptures.

00:09:59.679 --> 00:10:02.679
He paid with his life.

00:10:02.679 --> 00:10:07.679
Efforts to destroy God's message for mankind continue today,

00:10:07.679 --> 00:10:11.679
but the word of our God endures forever.

00:10:11.679 --> 00:10:17.179
Wasn't that faith strengthening to see more evidence

00:10:17.179 --> 00:10:20.179
that the Bible is God's word?

00:10:20.179 --> 00:10:23.179
How can we strengthen our conviction in God's word?

00:10:23.179 --> 00:10:27.179
We can do so by creating study projects to build our faith.

00:10:27.179 --> 00:10:30.179
One fascinating project involves the prophecy

00:10:30.179 --> 00:10:33.179
at Genesis chapter 3 and verse 15.

00:10:33.179 --> 00:10:35.179
Perhaps you can quote it by heart,

00:10:35.179 --> 00:10:39.179
but have you ever sat down and taken the time to make a timeline?

00:10:39.179 --> 00:10:42.179
Listing key scriptures that show how God bit by bit

00:10:42.179 --> 00:10:44.179
shed light on the individuals

00:10:44.179 --> 00:10:47.179
and the arrangement referred to in this verse.

00:10:47.179 --> 00:10:50.179
When we take time to really study the Bible

00:10:50.179 --> 00:10:54.179
and meditate on these golden threads running through the Bible,

00:10:54.179 --> 00:10:57.179
our faith in God's word will be strengthened.

00:10:57.179 --> 00:11:00.179
Have you had doubts about something?

00:11:00.179 --> 00:11:02.179
Then write it down.

00:11:02.179 --> 00:11:05.179
Then use our research tools such as the study Bible,

00:11:05.179 --> 00:11:09.179
JW Library, watch our online library to dig deeper.

00:11:09.179 --> 00:11:11.179
It's worth the effort.

00:11:11.179 --> 00:11:13.179
And if you're a parent,

00:11:13.179 --> 00:11:15.179
help your children come to know

00:11:15.179 --> 00:11:19.179
and fall in love with the author of the Bible.

00:11:19.179 --> 00:11:24.549
We are so close to begin the real life in the new world,

00:11:24.549 --> 00:11:28.549
now is the time to strengthen our trust and confidence in the Bible.

00:11:28.549 --> 00:11:31.549
When we have strong faith in God's word,

00:11:31.549 --> 00:11:34.549
we can feel as did our young brother Ruslan,

00:11:34.549 --> 00:11:36.549
from Turkmenistan,

00:11:36.549 --> 00:11:40.549
who faces his second prison term because of his faith.

00:11:40.549 --> 00:11:42.549
He declared,

00:11:42.549 --> 00:11:46.549
I have strong faith that Jehovah will reward me

00:11:46.549 --> 00:11:48.549
where there is a strong hope,

00:11:48.549 --> 00:11:50.549
there is endless joy,

00:11:50.549 --> 00:11:52.549
where there is joy,

00:11:52.549 --> 00:11:54.549
there is strength and endurance,

00:11:54.549 --> 00:11:58.549
and a strong person can never be broken.

00:11:58.549 --> 00:12:01.549
You too will never be broken

00:12:01.549 --> 00:12:05.549
if you maintain your faith in God's word.

00:12:05.549 --> 00:12:08.549
Brother Samuel heard of the governing body

00:12:08.549 --> 00:12:12.549
will now present the next talk on this symposium,

00:12:12.549 --> 00:12:16.549
why we have faith in God's moral standards.
