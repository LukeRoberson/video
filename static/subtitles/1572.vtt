00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:13.740
Please find yourself. It's time to start our graduation program.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.579
We never dreamed this would happen.

00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:22.780
This is a very special day. All of us have been anxiously waiting for. We're happy to see

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:23.780
all of you.

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:28.320
It all started a few years ago.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.079
If you'd like to have the circuit over here and is white for a meal, please see.

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:37.079
It was during that visit and this question.

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:46.159
This theme on Tuesday is, what lessons can we learn from Philip, the evangelizer?

00:00:46.159 --> 00:00:52.399
What could we learn from Philip? Honestly, we were already busy with the right things.

00:00:52.399 --> 00:01:02.700
Lily and the girls helped out wherever they could. I worked on Kingdom Hall maintenance

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:16.299
projects and we had a regular schedule for the ministry. But like in a lot of places,

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:28.340
when someone showed interest, it was tough to find them again. I wondered if our spiritual

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:45.599
routine needed an update. Looking forward to that talk, I decided we'd research Philip

00:01:45.599 --> 00:02:01.560
for Family Worship, Acts 6. Philip was one of seven brothers selected to distribute

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:20.250
food to Christian widows in Jerusalem. That was an important assignment. He did so much

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:41.990
more than that.

00:02:41.990 --> 00:03:12.539
This is interesting. Because of the persecution, Philip had to flee from Jerusalem to Samaria.

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:37.199
Samaria hadn't accepted the word of Jehovah yet, but Philip saw that trial as a spiritual

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:50.219
opportunity. Samaria was largely untouched by the preaching work. Philip declared the

00:03:50.219 --> 00:04:08.159
good news sell asleep and many believed and got baptized. Some time later, an angel spoke

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:32.879
with him. He told Philip to get up and go to the south. That led him to find the Ethiopian

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:39.550
unique and preach in other cities. Philip was willing to serve wherever there was

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:45.269
a need. And he always kept that evangelizing spirit. Some 20 years later, he was still

00:04:45.269 --> 00:04:58.589
known as the evangelizer. By that time, his life had changed. He was a family man with

00:04:58.589 --> 00:05:07.310
four daughters. But that didn't stop him from showing hospitality when Paul and his

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:19.699
companions came to visit. Visits like that must have been full of spiritual lessons for

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:32.040
his daughters. That night, we came up with a few things we wanted to do. We started

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:41.879
by having the circuit over here to lunch. We had it made time for that in a while.

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:58.300
Alex and Carla's experiences made the girls excited to reach their own spiritual goals.

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:10.610
But like Philip, changes came that we didn't expect. I was out of work for a few months.

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:23.220
It was a stressful time. But also a spiritual opportunity. I could visit people at different

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:36.500
times of the day. We tried to make the most of the situation and preach zealously.

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:47.790
Like Philip, in here we are. Watching our girls graduate from the school for Kingdom

00:06:47.790 --> 00:07:02.980
evangelizers. Those few lessons made a big difference for this family of evangelizers.
