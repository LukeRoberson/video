00:00:02.189 --> 00:00:05.190
And in production to the letter of James,

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:12.949
there is strong evidence that the James who wrote this inspired letter was Jesus' half-brother.

00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:18.780
James wrote the letter before 62 CE.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.780
He was living in Jerusalem at the time.

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:30.079
The letter stresses the need to display faith and endurance amid trials,

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:34.079
to avoid sins that lead to divine disapproval,

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.189
and to prove our faith by our works.

00:00:39.189 --> 00:00:46.189
Like Jesus, James used many simple yet powerful illustrations drawn from common things,

00:00:46.189 --> 00:00:50.189
waves of the sea, flowers and trees,

00:00:50.189 --> 00:00:53.189
a man looking at himself in a mirror,

00:00:53.189 --> 00:00:57.189
and material riches that perish.

00:00:57.189 --> 00:01:00.189
The letter of James has five chapters.

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:07.189
Chapter 1 reminds us to keep asking God for wisdom, doing so in faith.

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:14.189
And that the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea driven by the wind and blown about.

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:21.189
Chapter 2 contains strong counsel for those favoring the wealthy over the poor,

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:28.189
thus creating class distinctions and violating the royal law of neighborly love.

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:33.189
Did you know James often eludes to the sermon on the Mount.

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:38.189
For example, he says that we can have joy when persecuted.

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.189
We must do the will of God, not simply hear it.

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:49.239
And if we want God to forgive us, we must forgive others.

00:01:49.239 --> 00:01:56.239
In Chapter 3, James uses a variety of comparisons to illustrate our need to control our tongue,

00:01:56.239 --> 00:02:00.239
especially as this true of teachers of God's word.

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:06.709
James compares the tongue to such things as the bridle of a horse,

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:12.710
the rudder of a ship, a fire and a spring of water.

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:19.710
Chapter 4 explains that wicked conduct has its roots in fleshly desires.

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:28.710
James also states, whoever wants to be a friend of the world is making himself an enemy of God.

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:36.710
On the other hand, when we oppose the devil and draw close to God, he will draw close to us.

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:44.710
Chapter 5 tells us that the rich and powerful who oppress others will have to answer to Jehovah.

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:48.710
James also highlights the importance of patience.

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:52.710
Just as a farmer patiently waits for rain,

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:58.710
we must patiently wait for God to fulfill his promises and connection with Christ.

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:08.469
In the meantime, anyone who becomes spiritually sick should seek help from the congregation elders.

00:03:08.469 --> 00:03:16.469
The elders' loving use of God's word and their prayers of faith can help us sick one to become well.

00:03:16.469 --> 00:03:23.469
As you read the letter of James, note how we should never blame Jehovah for our trials.

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:31.469
How we should take great care to control our tongue and how we should be patient as we await God's kingdom.
