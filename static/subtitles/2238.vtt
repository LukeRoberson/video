00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:11.789
In carrying out the commission to preach the good news of God's kingdom, Jehovah's Witnesses

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:17.929
have published hundreds of books and distributed millions of copies throughout the world.

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:23.030
Of these, one particular book stands above all the rest.

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:28.350
This book has a long history and was the triumph of years of research.

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:34.670
The book we are talking about is the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures.

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:40.990
It is a record of the sacred writings of God and held by some to be among the best translations

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:44.149
of the Bible ever produced.

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:46.469
But how did it come to be?

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:52.229
And what makes it important for those interested in the truth about God?

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:57.950
By the mid-19th century, Bible translations into English were readily available.

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:02.509
Charles Tase Russell used a variety of Bibles in his research.

00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:08.430
He shared his suggestions with the readers of the magazine Zion's Watchtower.

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.189
Writing in 1880, Russell recommended to other Bible students the emphatic Diaglot and

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:19.269
versions done by Tishendorf and the American Bible Union.

00:01:19.269 --> 00:01:26.189
By 1884, Russell, along with others interested in promoting Bible education, legally registered

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.909
the Zion's Watchtower Tract Society.

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:36.269
Zion's Watchtower grew to become a Bible distributor as a service to its readers.

00:01:36.269 --> 00:01:40.269
The society drew attention to informative Bible translations.

00:01:40.269 --> 00:01:46.269
In fact, they bought large quantities so as to get good rates and then made them available

00:01:46.269 --> 00:01:49.469
at greatly reduced cost.

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:54.989
A Bible student could purchase editions such as The King James Bible and the so-called

00:01:54.989 --> 00:01:56.989
Teacher's Bibles.

00:01:56.989 --> 00:02:04.670
These were The King James translation along with a concordance, maps, and marginal references.

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:11.349
The emphatic Diaglot, it featured a Greek to English interlinear rendering.

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:17.669
Leicester's translation, it placed English text alongside the Hebrew.

00:02:17.669 --> 00:02:22.949
Also the Newberry Bible, which had marginal references that drew attention to the occurrences

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:27.990
of the divine name Jehovah in the original language.

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:33.750
Tishendorf's New Testament, it had footnote references that clarified the variations in

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.710
ancient Greek Bible manuscripts.

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:42.949
Zion's Watchtower Society arranged for a special printing of the New Testament by Joseph

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:44.430
Rothram.

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:51.229
This was the first time a Bible was published bearing the society name.

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:59.389
In 1896, the corporation legally changed its name to the Watchtower Bible and Track Society.

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:03.349
This organization did not print and bind Bibles at that time.

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:07.310
Instead, it arranged with commercial firms to do that work.

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:15.509
However, it can be said that the organization was an active publisher of Bible translations.

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:21.550
In time, the organization would take the production of Bible translations into its own hands.

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:27.789
In December 1926, the Watchtower printed and bound the emphatic Diaglot in its concord

00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:30.550
street factory.

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:37.229
It would be in 1942 when a complete Bible, the King James with marginal references, was

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:39.270
produced.

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:45.069
As useful as these various publications were, the organization was determined to convey

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:50.439
God's word in the best manner possible.

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:57.360
At Yankee Stadium, on Wednesday, August 2, 1950, then President of the Watchtower Bible

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:05.039
and Track Society, Nathan Nor revealed to the 82,075 in attendance that something new had

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:06.879
been obtained.

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:11.639
The accumulation of years of modern Bible scholarship was bearing fruit.

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:23.819
But now, it has the extreme pleasure of relating to the international, the opposite,

00:04:23.819 --> 00:04:29.939
the increase in the assembly of the Jewish citizens, the no-world translation of the

00:04:29.939 --> 00:04:48.899
Christians.

00:04:48.899 --> 00:04:53.339
The scholarship for the New World Translation would continue with the gradual publication

00:04:53.339 --> 00:04:56.100
of the Hebrew Scriptures.

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:01.699
The Bible would be released in sections over the span of the next 11 years, culminating

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:06.339
in a single volume produced in 1961.

00:05:06.339 --> 00:05:14.339
The cost to obtain this complete New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures, one dollar.

00:05:14.339 --> 00:05:20.660
At last, a translation that sincere Bible students could be confident in.

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:24.779
In the past, many of the brothers and sisters have had to use the Bible that Christenham

00:05:24.779 --> 00:05:26.300
has translated.

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:30.660
And because of Christenham's belief in the Trinity, Hell, Fire and other things, the

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:35.139
brothers continually, when they're reading the text, I have to ask themselves the question,

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:38.300
does it really say this in the original language?

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:43.220
But now that they have a Bible, whether it's in English or another language, that has

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:49.259
been prepared by Jehovah's organization, by those who understand the Scriptures, that

00:05:49.259 --> 00:05:50.860
breeds confidence.

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:54.379
And the brothers, when they read the Bible, they don't have to be thinking about, does

00:05:54.379 --> 00:06:00.019
it really say this, but they can start to think about, what does this mean for me?

00:06:00.019 --> 00:06:06.180
The original New World Translation Committee left behind an amazing legacy of Bible scholarship.

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:11.420
These are some of the documents produced by the Committee over a 12-year period.

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:18.899
This is essentially the entire Bible produced painstakingly by manual typewriter and hand.

00:06:18.899 --> 00:06:26.459
When you open these binders, you gain insight on a tremendous work done decades ago.

00:06:26.459 --> 00:06:32.060
For example, on the first page of Genesis, the handwritten note of when the translation

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:41.779
work began on this portion of Scripture, 11.30 a.m. Tuesday, February 12, 1952.

00:06:41.779 --> 00:06:49.100
Genesis 2.4, the first occurrence of God's name, Jehovah, in the Bible.

00:06:49.259 --> 00:06:59.339
Handwritten marginal references of Romans chapter 1, handwritten edits that would ultimately

00:06:59.339 --> 00:07:02.540
be used in the final production.

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:08.620
Genesis 1.4, after that, God saw that the light was good.

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:16.300
Genesis 2.5, now there was as yet no shrub of the field found in the earth.

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:20.860
And so the work would go through 66 books of the Bible.

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:28.459
They did this work without computers, without all the electronic reference items that we have these days.

00:07:28.459 --> 00:07:33.500
And yet when we look at how they consistently tried to translate God's Word in a manner

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:37.740
that would be clear and understandable and yet still faithful to the original,

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:41.500
personally, it amazes me how they were able to accomplish it.

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:45.259
But on the other hand, I shouldn't be amazed because I know it was Jehovah's spirit

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:49.420
that was with those brothers that helped them in that regard.

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:54.939
All this work was accomplished by a committee of Bible scholars who wish to remain anonymous.

00:07:55.660 --> 00:08:00.459
Their desire was that this Bible should bring attention to God and not to them.

00:08:01.339 --> 00:08:05.259
Without question, the translation's greatest accomplishment

00:08:05.259 --> 00:08:09.579
is the conscientious effort to render God's name, Jehovah,

00:08:09.579 --> 00:08:13.259
in all the places it would have been featured in the original writings.

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:17.899
The New World translation was not the first to present God's name,

00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:24.459
but it perhaps became the first to be consistent with its renderings in both the Hebrew

00:08:24.459 --> 00:08:26.379
and Greek portions of the Bible.

00:08:27.259 --> 00:08:31.660
The Greek scripture rendering of Jehovah has brought criticism from some.

00:08:32.379 --> 00:08:37.340
The critics claim that Jesus' followers would have observed the Jewish superstition

00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:39.659
that forbids the speaking of God's name.

00:08:40.539 --> 00:08:45.740
It should be noted that other translations of the Bible also render the name Jehovah

00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:51.019
in the Greek scriptures. The reason for doing so is very logical.

00:08:51.019 --> 00:08:54.460
We see that Jehovah's name clearly is in the Hebrew text.

00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:57.980
So quotations are made from the Hebrew Bible.

00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:00.059
They should be there in the Greek text as well.

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:07.019
So by Jehovah's people being honest in trying to do what they see needs to be done,

00:09:07.019 --> 00:09:11.820
no matter what the world may offer as an opinion, that builds confidence as well in the

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:17.580
translation. When we see how the New World translation really holds Jehovah's name up on high,

00:09:18.379 --> 00:09:23.580
that warms our hearts and helps us to get to know Jehovah's as a person and as a friend.

00:09:25.179 --> 00:09:30.379
The New World translation did not go unnoticed by those interested in Bible scholarship.

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:36.539
This work reflects an honest endeavor to achieve an understanding of the text that is as

00:09:36.539 --> 00:09:43.340
accurate as possible. I have never discovered in the New World translation any biased intent to

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:50.220
read something into the text that it does not contain. The most scholarly Bible ever produced

00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:57.019
is the New World Translation Reference Edition of 1984, containing the most advanced study aids.

00:09:58.059 --> 00:10:02.700
Evidence of the depth of research available is the fact that at some of the organization's

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:09.419
Bible schools, students will spend five to two hour sessions learning its marginal references,

00:10:09.419 --> 00:10:16.299
footnotes, and appendices. The results are more than just an academic appreciation of the translation.

00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:24.220
The attention to detail touches hearts. When the class finishes, usually the reaction of the

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:31.340
students is they're totally amized and that is a joyous occasion when we see the practical benefit

00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:36.539
that it's not an academic feature is not just something to look at for the sake of studying,

00:10:36.539 --> 00:10:41.419
but something that will help them every day of their lives so that they can search the scriptures

00:10:41.419 --> 00:10:49.500
more thoroughly. This afternoon we release the New World Translation, the complete Bible,

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:58.059
both in the Slovak and in the Czech languages. Since 1961, the New World Translation has been

00:10:58.059 --> 00:11:08.649
released in over 120 languages with a printing of over 200 million. The means by which it is offered

00:11:08.649 --> 00:11:21.259
includes printed books, sound recordings, internet pages, and by means of video,

00:11:22.539 --> 00:11:30.230
sign languages for the deaf. While it certainly stands as an achievement of great scholarship,

00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:36.629
more than that. The New World Translation has been instrumental in bringing millions of

00:11:36.629 --> 00:11:43.590
honest-hearted persons to an accurate knowledge of the truth. All thanks and praise go to the

00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:52.710
author of the Bible, our God, Jehovah.
