00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:05.740
When I was young, I had an internal struggle.

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:08.740
I was studying, but I was just doing it for my mom.

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:11.740
Just like any typical kid I didn't want to stand out

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:13.740
or be different.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.739
I walked ten minutes to school, ten minutes to the Kingdom Hall,

00:00:16.739 --> 00:00:19.739
lived right in my territory.

00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:21.739
So it was like in the little bubble.

00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:26.739
So it's common to just bump into your classmates or people, you know.

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:29.739
I didn't know what their reaction would be.

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:32.740
Sometimes you imagine people laughing at you.

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:37.020
I was afraid of endangering the friendship.

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.020
Because I was raised in a religiously divided household,

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.020
I always knew I had a choice.

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:47.549
But at the same time, I would feel bad if I didn't defend my face

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:49.549
and my conscience would bother me.

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:50.549
So it was always a struggle.

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:52.549
I knew what the right thing to do was,

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:55.929
but I didn't have the courage to do the right thing.

00:00:55.929 --> 00:00:58.929
I still clearly remember when I was twelve.

00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:01.929
Just one day out of the blue, I picked up a magazine on my own

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:04.930
and read it from cover to cover for the first time.

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:06.930
And that left a deep impression.

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:07.930
It just touched my heart that day.

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.930
And then I thought, oh, there must be other books that I'm missing out.

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.930
So I just started reading other publications.

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.930
The brothers and sisters' experiences really touched my heart.

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.930
I was always amazed the courage they had

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.930
and I always wanted to imitate that.

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.930
When my mom's Bible teacher started studying with me

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.930
and helped me to meditate more on what I had learned,

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.930
and she introduced the inside book to me.

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:34.930
And that tool really helped me to dig deeper

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:36.930
as I was doing personal study.

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.930
After doing it little by little,

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.930
I realized that studying is enjoyable,

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.930
especially when you study just for yourself.

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.930
To deepen your faith in Jehovah

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.930
and gave me the courage that I needed.

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:52.930
At the beginning of every school year,

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.930
I would introduce myself as one of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:56.930
It was not easy.

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:58.930
I would always pray.

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:00.930
Especially the night before that.

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.930
And in every year, it got easier and easier.

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.930
It took courage, but Jehovah helped me.

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.930
Classmates asked what I did over the weekend.

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:10.930
I would always mention spiritual activities

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:12.930
and they would tell me their problems.

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.930
And I would try to always think of a Bible principal

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.930
or an article that could help them.

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.930
One time the class was given the assignment

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.930
to pick a topic for a persuasive speech.

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.930
So I decided to use that opportunity to give a witness.

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.930
And chose the topic evolution versus creation.

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.930
The more I defended my faith, the more I realized

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.930
there was nothing to be afraid of.

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.930
After all, none of my classmates or teachers

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.930
ever had a bad reaction like I imagined they would.

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.930
I was able to regular auxiliary throughout high school.

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.930
That definitely served as a protection.

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.930
And kept me busy and right after high school

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.930
I was able to start regular pioneering.

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.930
One blessing is being able to have a good conscience.

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.930
Knowing I didn't try to hide who I am,

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.930
just to fit in.

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.930
It wasn't easy at first, but gradually I realized

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.930
that having a relationship with Jehovah

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.930
is something to be proud of.
