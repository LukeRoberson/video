00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:09.279
Our text for discussion today here in Matthew 6 verse 33 contains two parts.

00:00:09.279 --> 00:00:12.439
The first part is what we have to do.

00:00:12.439 --> 00:00:18.640
It says, keep on then seeking first the kingdom and his righteousness.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:24.640
The second part is what your hovered will do and all these other things will be added

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.760
to you.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:34.140
We think carefully about these words, Jesus actually was educating his disciples to make

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.079
a dramatic change in their lifestyle.

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:39.880
What do we mean by that?

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:48.799
Well look at verse 31, he says, so never be anxious and say, what are we to eat, or what

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:53.079
are we to drink, or what are we to wear?

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:55.320
Did Jesus say never?

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.960
Yes, but those are the things we normally do.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.000
We are anxious about our existence.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.719
And Jesus recognizes that most people are that way.

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:15.120
He says in verse 32, for all these other things the nations are eagerly pursuing.

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:24.000
But then he says, your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.079
Here in this chapter Jesus outlines a number of very important principles that actually

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:38.840
change the way we look at life and the way we see our existence in relationship to Jehovah

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.319
God.

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:48.599
He puts service to Jehovah in the first place, regardless of our circumstances.

00:01:48.599 --> 00:01:50.799
Let us have a look at two of these principles.

00:01:50.799 --> 00:02:01.239
The one is here in Matthew 6 verse 24, he says, no one can slave for two masters.

00:02:01.239 --> 00:02:06.799
For either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will stick to the one and despise

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:08.599
the other.

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:13.680
You cannot slave for God and for riches.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.120
It is just not possible.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.520
Some have tried, but they failed.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.639
Right and approach Jesus and said to him, I will give you riches.

00:02:23.639 --> 00:02:27.840
I will give you all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.680
Of course Jesus refused.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:30.879
Why?

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:35.240
Because he knew there was a price attached to it.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.479
What is the price?

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:38.479
Worship.

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:41.000
The vided worship, which is impossible.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.039
He knew it is impossible to worship both Jehovah and riches.

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:59.110
In verse 21, Jesus says, for where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:09.629
The second principle is in verse 25, and this account, I say to you, stop being anxious

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:15.710
about your lives as to what you will eat or what you will drink or about your bodies as

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:17.789
to what you will wear.

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:27.479
And here is the principle, does not life mean more than food and the body more than clothing.

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:29.879
You can have a storehouse full of food.

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:34.120
If you don't have life, you cannot eat it.

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:40.680
You can have a warehouse full of clothes, but if there is no body, you cannot wear it.

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:46.000
Jesus illustrated this principle beautifully in Luke.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:57.639
Turn to Luke, chapter 12, and from verse 16, with that he told him an illustration saying,

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:00.520
the land of a rich man produced well.

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:05.840
So he began reasoning within himself, what should I do now that I have nowhere to gather

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:06.840
my crops?

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.080
Then he said, I'll do this.

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:13.280
I'll tear down my storehouses and build bigger ones.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.000
And there I will gather all my grain and all my goods.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.519
And I will say to myself, you have many good things stored up for many years.

00:04:22.519 --> 00:04:26.720
Take it easy, eat, drink, enjoy yourself.

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:31.720
But God said to him, an unreasonable one.

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:37.120
This night they are demanding your life from you, who then is to have the things you

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.399
stored up.

00:04:39.399 --> 00:04:48.120
So it goes with a man who stores up treasurer for himself, but is not rich toward God.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:55.319
Jesus didn't say this man was dishonest, or that he never thought about God.

00:04:55.319 --> 00:05:00.600
The mistake the man made was his priorities were wrong.

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:05.560
He focused primarily on amassing wealth.

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.439
He did not do what it says in verse 21.

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:11.879
He did not store up treasurer for himself.

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:17.240
He stored up treasurer for himself, but did not store up treasurer with God in heaven.

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.560
He was not rich toward God.

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.040
And that is the key element, isn't it?

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:30.079
Our service to Jehovah God, our life for Jehovah, that is the key element.

00:05:30.079 --> 00:05:36.879
And as Jesus says in verse 15, the second part of verse 15, because even when a person

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:44.920
has an abundance, his life does not result from the things he possesses.

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:49.800
So these are the two very important principles we've covered.

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:56.600
First of all, make our service to God the priority and not amassing wealth.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:04.240
And the second one, keep on then seeking first the kingdom and God's righteousness.

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:07.519
And all these other things will be added to you.

00:06:07.519 --> 00:06:13.720
We do not know precisely when the end will come, but we want to keep on seeking first the

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:14.720
kingdom.

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:21.040
Rather than putting our trust in the securities of this world, we want to put our trust

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:23.360
in our heavenly Father.

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.040
Jehovah gives everything.

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:30.600
He gives more than what we need.

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:37.120
When it leases as 5 verse 19, it summarizes this whole principle.

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:42.120
It establishes the truth, the reality of the matter.

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:46.439
It says it leases as 5 verse 19.

00:06:46.439 --> 00:06:54.079
Also, when the true God gives a man riches and material possessions, along with the

00:06:54.079 --> 00:07:03.600
ability to enjoy them, he should take his reward and rejoice in his hard work.

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:06.079
This is the gift of God.
