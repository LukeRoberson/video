00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:16.250
Authority. That word alone makes some cringe uncomfortably due to abuses at seemingly

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:23.809
all levels. In fact, a modern trend of thinking is to question all authority and to respect

00:00:23.809 --> 00:00:31.050
none. This attitude has permeated society and is viewed as the norm today. Such a spirit

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:39.929
can be infectious like a disease and can distort our own view of submitting to authority.

00:00:39.929 --> 00:00:47.530
What about the expression godly authority? Does that sound more palatable to you and

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:55.969
even more importantly, is there any indication in God's word that shows how Jehovah feels

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:04.250
about loyal submission to his authority? A sobering yet gripping account in the Bible

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:11.569
book of Numbers, Chapter 16, commands our attention. The following drama will present

00:01:11.569 --> 00:01:19.530
these events and their significant effects on the nation of Israel. As you watch, try to

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:28.370
determine which character best represents your deepest feelings about authority. How

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:37.370
is godly authority demonstrated among humans? Also try to see how many different aspects of

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:45.969
loyalty you can identify as this struggle between right and wrong unfolds before you. At

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:51.450
the conclusion of this drama, we will discuss these questions and their application for

00:01:51.450 --> 00:03:56.979
us today. And now our drama presentation, Respect Jehovah's Authority. Your father must

00:03:56.979 --> 00:04:02.659
be really proud of you. Thank you Uncle Cana. You've become a great musician. No, an excellent

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:09.340
musician. You have a future at the tabernacle. You've all taught me so much. I just was grandfather

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:14.939
here to see which I've learned. You know, your grandfather Korra built that heart for me when I

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:20.459
was about your age. It's been in the family a long time now. I know. Fathers told me many times that

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:25.100
grandfather taught all of you how to play and how grandfather was at Moses's side when Jehovah

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:30.620
directed the execution of the idolaters after the Exodus. At that time he was quite a force for

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:37.819
righteousness. But he usually doesn't say much else. Sometimes he gets the saddest look on his face.

00:04:40.019 --> 00:04:47.540
Kind of like the one you have now. Well, my son, it was a long story behind this look on my face.

00:04:48.899 --> 00:04:55.620
Your father and I don't talk about it much anymore. Back then you were too young to understand what

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:01.620
was going on or why things had to happen the way they did. But you're not a little boy anymore,

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:09.240
are you? So why don't I try to fill in some of the gaps, huh? You see, your grandfather Korra

00:05:09.319 --> 00:05:15.560
wasn't assistant to the priests like I am and like you will be one day. In fact, he was the first

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:22.519
cousin of Moses. Now, Jehovah used Moses to deliver us miraculously from slavery to the Egyptians,

00:05:22.519 --> 00:05:27.560
opening the Red Sea right before us. That's an experience I'll never forget. Everyone says

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:33.959
what an awesome day that was. I remember when we were little, father always tell us the story of

00:05:33.959 --> 00:05:39.399
Jehovah delivering it to the Red Sea, who was one of my favorites and still is. Yes.

00:05:40.439 --> 00:05:45.720
But shortly afterwards, many didn't continue to appreciate all that Jehovah had done for us.

00:05:46.839 --> 00:05:50.439
After the Exodus, Jehovah spoke to us by means of Moses saying,

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:55.639
if you will strictly obey my voice and will indeed keep my covenant,

00:05:56.519 --> 00:05:59.879
then you will certainly become my special property out of all other peoples.

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:05.560
Now, we had no problem in answering unanimously. All that Jehovah spoke and we are willing to do.

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:11.959
But little did we know that real challenges would be awaiting us during our wilderness trek.

00:06:18.139 --> 00:06:19.339
Let's go in the back.

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:33.449
Now it's perfect.

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:34.250
Ready.

00:06:35.769 --> 00:06:38.089
This is last one.

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:47.079
And then, Jehovah told Moses, stretch your hand out over the sea so that the waters may come back

00:06:47.079 --> 00:07:01.339
over the Egyptians. And the waters covered the war chariots and the cavalry men belonging to

00:07:01.339 --> 00:07:03.980
pharaoh, and not so much as one of them was left.

00:07:04.939 --> 00:07:14.810
Fun. Let's do it again.

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:18.889
So this time, I want to be Moses. Only if you fill the water jug.

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:20.649
Because I did it last time.

00:07:34.889 --> 00:07:39.449
I can't believe my ears. You should at least try to understand why your father opposes Moses,

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:42.569
that people are fed up with Moses' authority.

00:07:42.569 --> 00:07:47.129
Haven't you noticed all the murmuring and complaining lately?

00:07:48.009 --> 00:07:51.769
Don't you see that Moses and his clan exceed their authority over Jehovah's people?

00:07:52.569 --> 00:07:57.290
And I don't like the way you speak. You're a Levite like us, our cousin.

00:07:57.850 --> 00:08:00.250
You know that Jehovah appointed Moses and Aaron,

00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:04.649
and that Moses is actually Jehovah's choice to lead our nation to the Promised Land.

00:08:04.649 --> 00:08:09.769
But Elcana, as my uncle Kora, your father has repeatedly stressed the whole assembly

00:08:09.769 --> 00:08:14.970
all of them are holy. Why should Moses and Aaron lift themselves up above the congregation of Jehovah?

00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:18.089
Hasn't Kora himself worshipped Jehovah for many years?

00:08:18.889 --> 00:08:21.050
Even under the hardships of slavery in Egypt.

00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:25.689
And he was privileged to witness the miraculous deliverance of our nations through the red sea.

00:08:25.769 --> 00:08:31.850
By the hand of Moses, he even lifted up his voice and sang praising Jehovah for having destroyed

00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:34.730
the Egyptian pursuer in the very same sea.

00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:40.090
Yes, Abiasif, and don't forget, your father proved his loyalty to Jehovah by sharing

00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:44.490
in the execution of God's judgment against the calf-worshiping Israelites at Mount Sinai.

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:47.610
I still remember her father, along with the rest,

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:52.730
faster the camp of Israel and killed 3,000 idolaters with a sword in obedience to Jehovah.

00:08:52.809 --> 00:08:58.649
But now, exactly my point, Asir, would you consider such a tested and true Levite a rebel,

00:08:58.649 --> 00:09:00.250
a person disloyal to Jehovah?

00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:03.769
Kora only tries to be balanced, reasonable.

00:09:03.769 --> 00:09:05.850
I have to disagree with you, Amzai.

00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:10.409
Everybody who knows Moses well will agree that he is by far the meekest of all men.

00:09:10.409 --> 00:09:13.450
And we've seen how Moses always asks for Jehovah's direction.

00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:16.409
And then just obediently follows through.

00:09:16.409 --> 00:09:18.970
So Amzai, whose will is actually carried out?

00:09:19.529 --> 00:09:22.169
That of Moses or that of Jehovah?

00:09:22.169 --> 00:09:23.610
Supposedly Jehovah's will.

00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:25.690
That is the real issue before us.

00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:28.889
In the first place, it was Jehovah who appointed Moses

00:09:28.889 --> 00:09:31.769
in order to glorify his own holy name before Pharaoh,

00:09:31.769 --> 00:09:35.049
to lead us out of slavery into the promised land.

00:09:35.049 --> 00:09:40.009
We all know the reservations Moses initially had when Jehovah asked him to speak to Pharaoh.

00:09:40.009 --> 00:09:40.730
That's true.

00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:44.009
If I remember correctly, Moses replied that he wasn't a fluent speaker,

00:09:44.009 --> 00:09:46.330
that he was slow of mouth and slow of tongue.

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:49.929
He even asked Jehovah if someone else could be used to save our people.

00:09:49.929 --> 00:09:54.090
It was then that he appointed his brother, Aaron, as a mouth to Moses.

00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:58.570
Isn't it clear, then, Amzai, that both Moses and Aaron have not arbitrarily

00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:00.730
lifted themselves up above the congregation?

00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:03.610
And if anyone objects to their authority,

00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:06.490
you and someone who in the past has been faithful in loyal,

00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:09.210
whose authority do you think he's actually challenging?

00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:11.850
Well, I know I have to answer Jehovah's authority.

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:15.129
However, in my eyes, Moses' leadership is a failure.

00:10:15.129 --> 00:10:16.649
Why are we in the promised land yet?

00:10:16.649 --> 00:10:18.330
Uncle, uncle, guess who I am.

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:19.529
Why, I don't know.

00:10:19.529 --> 00:10:20.409
I'm Moses.

00:10:20.409 --> 00:10:22.169
And on the water of the Red Sea,

00:10:22.169 --> 00:10:24.570
crashing down on the Egyptians.

00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:28.090
What time in time when Jehovah rescued us in the Egyptians

00:10:28.090 --> 00:10:30.490
and opened the water of the Red Sea before us?

00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:31.210
Yeah.

00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:33.049
That certainly was a day to remember.

00:10:33.049 --> 00:10:36.090
You and your friends will have to show us this great act of Jehovah one day.

00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:38.090
But now it's almost time for the evening meal.

00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:40.330
Please go wash yourself up and have your little friends help you

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:41.690
fill one of the water, Jocs.

00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:43.210
As you say, Father.

00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:45.929
No, no, one of the clean ones at the back of the tent.

00:10:45.929 --> 00:10:46.889
Yes, Father.

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:55.110
Would you three claim that Moses and Aaron are always right?

00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:56.549
Don't they make mistakes?

00:10:56.549 --> 00:10:57.750
Of course they do.

00:10:57.750 --> 00:11:00.950
Because obviously they're imperfect men like the rest of us.

00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:04.309
Jehovah surely is aware of their mistakes more than any of us.

00:11:04.309 --> 00:11:07.350
Like when Moses got married to that Kushite woman.

00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:11.269
It's a disgrace that we're led by a man whose wife is not even a daughter of Abraham.

00:11:11.269 --> 00:11:14.710
Yes, but support our worships Jehovah the same as we do.

00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:18.149
And remember what happened when Mary and Aaron began to speak against Moses

00:11:18.149 --> 00:11:19.269
on account of his wife?

00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:21.909
Yes, and don't you think it was reasonable for them to ask

00:11:21.909 --> 00:11:24.549
if it was just by Moses alone that Jehovah had spoken?

00:11:24.549 --> 00:11:26.470
Was it not by them also he had spoken?

00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:30.629
Jehovah was listening Amzai, and he immediately made known his view of matters.

00:11:30.629 --> 00:11:33.909
God said about Moses, he is being entrusted with all my house.

00:11:33.909 --> 00:11:35.750
Mouth to mouth, I speak to him.

00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:37.669
Then Jehovah pointedly asked,

00:11:37.669 --> 00:11:41.590
why then did you not fear to speak against my servant, against Moses?

00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:45.190
And for her rebellion, Miriam was struck with leprosy for seven days.

00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:47.509
Remember, we couldn't pull away until she recovered

00:11:47.669 --> 00:11:49.509
and was able to come back into the camp.

00:11:49.509 --> 00:11:53.029
Aaron had to admit that turning against Jehovah's appointed one

00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:56.629
was a sin, a foolish act.

00:11:57.429 --> 00:11:59.350
He learned a very important lesson.

00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:02.230
I wish our father would learn the same.

00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:03.669
Anyway, that was in the past.

00:12:04.309 --> 00:12:06.389
There's something about you three I don't understand.

00:12:06.950 --> 00:12:10.549
How can you side with Moses against your own father who gave you life?

00:12:11.269 --> 00:12:13.909
The law specifically says you should honor your father.

00:12:14.789 --> 00:12:17.269
I'd expect you to be loyal and support your father,

00:12:17.269 --> 00:12:18.629
at least out of respect for him.

00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:20.230
How could you, Amzai?

00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:21.750
Make no mistake about it.

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:23.190
This isn't easy for us.

00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:25.590
We love our father, but we're not blind.

00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:30.789
And it's very painful to see him follow a course of stubborn opposition to Jehovah.

00:12:30.789 --> 00:12:33.750
But it's not just a question of taking sides with me or men,

00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:36.070
be it father or Moses or Aaron.

00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:39.269
We simply want to remain faithful to the one who appointed Moses.

00:12:39.269 --> 00:12:43.509
Jehovah, so the whole matter boils down to how can I put it

00:12:43.509 --> 00:12:47.110
to loyalty, loyalty to our father and to family,

00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:48.470
or loyalty to Jehovah?

00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:53.990
It grieves us to see our father being swayed by what appears to be wrong motives.

00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:55.029
Wrong motives?

00:12:55.029 --> 00:12:55.990
Here's something new.

00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:57.590
What do you mean by that, Alcana?

00:12:57.590 --> 00:12:59.590
Of course, I can't read my father's heart.

00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:01.830
And I in no way want to show disrespect for him.

00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:05.269
But lately, he seems to enjoy all the attention that

00:13:05.269 --> 00:13:07.350
Nathan, a Byron, and Ann, paid to him.

00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:13.110
I wonder if, evidently, he's not content with the place our family has in God's arrangement.

00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:15.750
It's not a small thing to be teachers of Jehovah's Law.

00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:19.190
And to carry the furniture and utensils of the tabernacle.

00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:23.590
Sadly, though, it seems that our father no longer finds satisfaction in serving us

00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:26.629
an assistant to Aaron and his priestly sons.

00:13:26.629 --> 00:13:31.350
What about Nathan, a Byron and Ann, who are distinguished leaders of the Rubenites,

00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:34.710
as well as the 250 other chiefdans, men of fame?

00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:36.710
They all seem to agree with Korah.

00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:39.990
Again, Amsai, you have to think about their possible motives.

00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:44.789
Could it be that since Ruben was the first born son of her forefather Jacob,

00:13:44.789 --> 00:13:50.470
some of these descendants of Ruben's may resent Moses exercising authority over them?

00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:54.309
And don't forget that our family camps near the Rubenites.

00:13:54.309 --> 00:13:59.429
There seems to be considerable inner change of thought between our father

00:13:59.429 --> 00:14:01.269
and certain prominent men of Ruben.

00:14:01.269 --> 00:14:05.509
I'm very much afraid that things will soon get out of hand.

00:14:05.509 --> 00:14:07.190
Why do you have to be so narrow-minded?

00:14:07.190 --> 00:14:08.950
Maybe it's time for a change.

00:14:09.269 --> 00:14:09.990
Change is good.

00:14:10.549 --> 00:14:12.950
I wonder what you're going to do when it comes to a showdown.

00:14:12.950 --> 00:14:17.110
As far as I'm concerned, Amsai, I cherish the honor that has been given to our family,

00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:19.509
serving Jehovah faithfully according to his arrangement.

00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:23.299
I feel the same, cousin.

00:14:23.299 --> 00:14:26.820
A dang Jehovah's courtyard is better than a thousand elsewhere.

00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:29.620
We have chosen to stand at the threshold in the house of our God,

00:14:30.259 --> 00:14:32.659
rather than to move about in the tense of wickedness.

00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:34.500
Watch, don't spell it.

00:14:35.779 --> 00:14:39.299
And now, Amsai, it's good for you to be here with us.

00:14:39.379 --> 00:14:42.259
Won't you please join my brothers and family for the evening meal?

00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:44.580
The first part of the meal is ready.

00:14:45.379 --> 00:14:46.419
Thank you, Alcana.

00:14:51.419 --> 00:14:52.620
We have been here too long.

00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:53.899
We know that I make decisions.

00:14:53.899 --> 00:14:55.259
Our decision has been wasted.

00:14:55.259 --> 00:14:56.220
I know leaders.

00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:57.340
Someone courageous.

00:14:57.340 --> 00:14:58.220
We need to get somebody.

00:14:59.179 --> 00:15:05.929
We need a man of action.

00:15:07.450 --> 00:15:08.809
We have been here too long.

00:15:08.809 --> 00:15:10.730
Sick of Moses not knowing what to do.

00:15:11.690 --> 00:15:12.409
We need to wake.

00:15:13.129 --> 00:15:14.490
We need a new leader.

00:15:14.490 --> 00:15:15.289
Man of courage.

00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:20.120
Someone who knows that I make decisions.

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:22.919
Peace to you, my brothers.

00:15:22.919 --> 00:15:24.919
Peace to you, Alcora.

00:15:24.919 --> 00:15:26.519
You can just in time.

00:15:26.519 --> 00:15:28.440
We were discussing your courage

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:30.840
and how you fearlessly resist Moses

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:32.279
and the number of issues.

00:15:32.279 --> 00:15:34.200
This is the kind of leadership we need.

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:37.720
Men like you are not intimidated by Moses and his clan.

00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:39.000
It's time to act.

00:15:39.559 --> 00:15:41.639
What happened to leadership in our nation?

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:45.799
I don't believe that Moses enjoys the confidence of the people anymore.

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:49.480
Look how often the people have to resort to complaining.

00:15:49.559 --> 00:15:51.240
And then when you think of the appointment

00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:52.919
of his brother Aaron as high priest,

00:15:52.919 --> 00:15:53.799
that makes you sick.

00:15:53.799 --> 00:15:55.639
My brothers, you are right.

00:15:56.519 --> 00:15:58.679
The next high priest would be half my age.

00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:01.879
Moses did not even consider me worthy

00:16:01.879 --> 00:16:03.240
to be a head of our own family.

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:04.519
The co-thites.

00:16:04.519 --> 00:16:06.519
He appointed Eli Zaytan.

00:16:06.519 --> 00:16:08.279
And man younger than me.

00:16:08.279 --> 00:16:11.000
Is it just by Moses alone that Jehovah speaks?

00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:13.480
No, what about Moses?

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:16.039
He's almost right there.

00:16:16.039 --> 00:16:19.720
Moses obviously delays it,

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:22.279
bringing us into the land that God has promised us.

00:16:22.919 --> 00:16:25.639
And yet, he says it's because of the people.

00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:39.419
Sadly, it seemed that my father and his associates

00:16:39.419 --> 00:16:41.259
had decided to question the authority

00:16:41.259 --> 00:16:43.500
of the ones whom Jehovah had appointed.

00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:44.460
Moses and Aaron.

00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:47.500
But a new situation would soon give them

00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:50.299
an opportunity to express their feelings openly.

00:16:51.419 --> 00:16:52.379
What happened next?

00:16:53.419 --> 00:16:56.059
Well, Jehovah directed Moses to send men

00:16:56.059 --> 00:16:57.340
to spy out the land of Canaan.

00:16:58.139 --> 00:17:00.700
But after 40 days, they returned and reported,

00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:02.940
we entered into the land to which you sent us out.

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:05.740
Nevertheless, we're not able to go up against the people

00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:07.660
because they are stronger than we are.

00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:09.819
And they kept on bringing forth to the sons

00:17:09.819 --> 00:17:11.180
of Israel a bad report.

00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:14.059
Then all the assembly raised their voice

00:17:14.059 --> 00:17:15.900
and continued giving vent to their voice

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:17.500
and weeping all through that night.

00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:21.740
And all the sons of Israel began to murmur

00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:23.660
against Moses and Aaron.

00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:33.240
I'm not staying.

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:34.839
This place makes me sick.

00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:39.380
Our wives and our little ones will become plunders.

00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:41.700
Why did we die in the land of Egypt?

00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:45.180
It's better than to...

00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:45.740
Hear me!

00:17:46.619 --> 00:17:48.220
Let us appoint a head

00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:49.980
and let us return to Egypt!

00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:57.690
This route to spy out is a very, very good land.

00:17:57.690 --> 00:17:59.690
A land that is flowing with milk and honey.

00:18:00.170 --> 00:18:02.490
Only against Jehovah do not rebel.

00:18:02.490 --> 00:18:05.450
And you do not you fear the people of the land

00:18:05.450 --> 00:18:06.730
for they are bred to us.

00:18:07.529 --> 00:18:09.369
My brothers, my brothers,

00:18:09.369 --> 00:18:11.130
these men will lead you to your death.

00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:12.329
Do not listen to them.

00:18:12.329 --> 00:18:14.650
Be of good courage, my brothers.

00:18:14.650 --> 00:18:17.210
Do not condemn God as having told you lies.

00:18:17.210 --> 00:18:19.130
Trust in Jehovah to help us

00:18:19.130 --> 00:18:21.609
and follow those whom he has appointed as leaders,

00:18:21.609 --> 00:18:23.450
even Moses and Aaron.

00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:25.130
Do not listen to them.

00:18:25.130 --> 00:18:26.890
These men deserve to die.

00:18:27.690 --> 00:18:28.650
Master them!

00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:54.089
Hear this word of Jehovah.

00:18:55.130 --> 00:18:57.450
All the while, Jehovah has heard your voice

00:18:58.250 --> 00:18:59.609
and he has become indignant.

00:19:00.809 --> 00:19:01.450
And he says,

00:19:02.170 --> 00:19:04.170
how long will this evil assembly

00:19:04.890 --> 00:19:07.529
have this murmuring that they are carrying on against me?

00:19:08.410 --> 00:19:11.369
I have heard the murmurings of the sons of Israel

00:19:11.369 --> 00:19:12.890
that they are murmuring against me.

00:19:13.690 --> 00:19:16.329
As I live is the utterance of Jehovah.

00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:19.930
If I shall not duty you just that way,

00:19:20.009 --> 00:19:21.690
is you have spoken in my ears.

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:27.000
In this wilderness,

00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:29.079
your carcasses will fall.

00:19:29.799 --> 00:19:32.839
Yes, all your registered ones,

00:19:32.839 --> 00:19:33.880
of all your number,

00:19:34.519 --> 00:19:36.200
from 20 years old upward,

00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:39.160
you who have murmured against me,

00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:42.039
not one among these men

00:19:42.039 --> 00:19:45.559
of this evil generation will see the good land

00:19:45.559 --> 00:19:47.480
that I swore to give to your fathers.

00:19:48.279 --> 00:19:49.799
Except Caleb,

00:19:50.519 --> 00:19:51.720
the son of Jaffana,

00:19:52.359 --> 00:19:53.319
and Joshua,

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:54.519
the son of none.

00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:59.160
As for your little ones of whom you said,

00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:00.359
plunder they will become,

00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:04.200
and your sons who today do not know good or bad,

00:20:04.759 --> 00:20:06.119
these will go in there.

00:20:06.359 --> 00:20:08.119
And to them I will give it,

00:20:08.119 --> 00:20:10.279
and they will take possession of it.

00:20:10.279 --> 00:20:13.160
Whereas the carcasses of you yourselves

00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:14.839
will fall in this wilderness.

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:27.109
Jehovah for Esmosis,

00:20:27.109 --> 00:20:29.190
that we may be reconciled to him,

00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:31.029
that he might permit us to wander no longer

00:20:31.029 --> 00:20:32.309
in the wilderness,

00:20:32.309 --> 00:20:33.990
but be still cities upon us.

00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:37.029
We shall go up and fight,

00:20:37.910 --> 00:20:43.140
ages men,

00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:46.019
for tomorrow we shall go up against the Canaanites.

00:20:53.339 --> 00:20:54.539
Jehovah said to me,

00:20:55.259 --> 00:20:57.660
say to them you must not go up and fight,

00:20:57.660 --> 00:20:59.740
because I am not in your midst,

00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:03.180
that you may not be defeated before your enemies.

00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:04.619
Go ahead on your swordsmen.

00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:08.140
Do not listen to Moses.

00:21:08.859 --> 00:21:16.519
Listen up, order the Canaan.

00:21:17.559 --> 00:21:24.519
Listen to Moses.

00:21:24.519 --> 00:21:27.880
That you are overstepping the order of Jehovah.

00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:29.319
You will not succeed.

00:21:30.359 --> 00:21:31.880
Do not go up,

00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:34.440
because Jehovah is not in your midst,

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:38.200
that you may not be defeated before your enemies.

00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:40.440
We shall fight for the Amalekites,

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.559
and the Canaanites are there before you,

00:21:43.559 --> 00:21:45.720
and you are certain to fall by the sword.

00:21:47.079 --> 00:21:49.000
Because for the reason,

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.640
that you turn back from following Jehovah,

00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:55.160
Jehovah will not continue with you.

00:21:56.519 --> 00:21:57.640
Turn it on!

00:21:57.640 --> 00:21:59.160
Jehovah is with us!

00:22:00.359 --> 00:22:20.390
To the top of the mountain,

00:22:21.109 --> 00:22:24.950
but the Ark of Jehovah's Covenant and Moses didn't move away from the midst of the camp.

00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:29.349
The Amalekites and the Canaanites who were dwelling in that mountain

00:22:30.069 --> 00:22:32.150
came on down and began striking them,

00:22:32.789 --> 00:22:34.869
and went scattering them as far as Horma.

00:22:36.549 --> 00:22:38.710
How far my father and the rest

00:22:39.430 --> 00:22:40.789
had drawn away from Jehovah.

00:22:44.309 --> 00:22:47.509
You see, although they were making great professions of faith,

00:22:48.309 --> 00:22:51.910
their murmuring and fault-finding with Jehovah's appointed servants

00:22:51.910 --> 00:22:54.309
was bringing them into open opposition.

00:22:54.309 --> 00:23:01.500
You were young then,

00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:05.099
but remember what agony our family went through?

00:23:06.539 --> 00:23:09.019
Some insisted that we had to follow Korra,

00:23:09.019 --> 00:23:10.460
after all he was our father.

00:23:11.579 --> 00:23:13.660
Our loyalty was on the line.

00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:36.119
And so young,

00:23:37.079 --> 00:23:40.839
I know his father must be grieving right now.

00:23:41.559 --> 00:23:44.599
So this young man grew up to become a fine soldier.

00:23:45.799 --> 00:23:50.920
Our defeat in no way should be taken as evidence that Jehovah is supposed to us.

00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:53.400
It's because of Moses that we suffer this defeat.

00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:55.799
Nathan, how can you say that?

00:23:56.440 --> 00:24:01.079
Korra said it's because we've permitted Moses to continue to impose himself

00:24:01.079 --> 00:24:02.759
and his own will upon the people.

00:24:02.759 --> 00:24:03.319
That's right.

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:06.039
If you listened to Jehovah's express warning through Moses,

00:24:06.039 --> 00:24:08.279
you would not have got up against the Canaanites.

00:24:08.279 --> 00:24:10.279
You would not have suffered this defeat.

00:24:10.279 --> 00:24:13.160
It's to our advantage to be our own master

00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:15.079
and to take to ourselves a new leader.

00:24:15.079 --> 00:24:20.009
A point, a new leader has gone too far.

00:24:20.009 --> 00:24:26.819
We've been fit to lead the people.

00:24:26.819 --> 00:24:30.819
Now that we are rejoicing in our deliverance from the Egyptians,

00:24:30.819 --> 00:24:33.619
why should we bear the tyranny of Moses over us?

00:24:33.619 --> 00:24:34.819
Right.

00:24:35.539 --> 00:24:38.660
And allow ourselves to be so deluded by him?

00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:49.380
Is this a viewpoint you may share with my father, Korra?

00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:53.380
Everyone knows that we live and move in act according to Moses' pleasure.

00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:56.500
Moses would have us believe the God foretells what concerns us

00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:58.579
only out of kindness to Moses.

00:24:58.579 --> 00:25:01.700
I see if we are not all the children of Abraham.

00:25:02.259 --> 00:25:08.299
As made Moses alone, the author of all the knowledge that we have

00:25:08.299 --> 00:25:10.299
and that we must still learn it from him.

00:25:10.299 --> 00:25:15.900
It's a very sad thing we have enacted before this,

00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:18.460
but have allowed Moses to seek glory for himself.

00:25:18.539 --> 00:25:21.660
Amzai, could I speak with you for a moment, please?

00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:31.589
As you say, cousin, what is it now?

00:25:31.589 --> 00:25:35.430
Amzai, why do you keep speaking so bitterly against Moses?

00:25:35.430 --> 00:25:38.710
It's because I'm no longer deceived by his persuasive words.

00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:41.750
It's his clever speech that has allowed him to obtain his authority

00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:44.549
under the pretense that he's following God's command.

00:25:44.549 --> 00:25:47.190
And now a bias if he's given the priesthood to Aaron.

00:25:47.190 --> 00:25:49.029
How can you speak this way, Amzai?

00:25:49.029 --> 00:25:51.269
We both have the great privilege of being set apart for...

00:25:51.269 --> 00:25:54.150
True a bias if, but why his own brother Aaron?

00:25:54.150 --> 00:25:57.029
It only gives cause for suspicion on the part of the older man.

00:25:57.029 --> 00:26:00.230
Are there not others among the Levites that are as well qualified as Aaron?

00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:02.470
Would you promote Korra to this office?

00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:04.390
Indeed a bias if and why not?

00:26:04.390 --> 00:26:06.710
Is not Korra equal to Moses himself?

00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:08.789
I hate to say it, but it's obvious.

00:26:08.789 --> 00:26:11.829
My father is only interested in his own advancement.

00:26:11.829 --> 00:26:14.309
Would you sit in judgment of your own father

00:26:14.309 --> 00:26:15.750
and older man who's interested?

00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:18.309
Amzai, come, please.

00:26:18.309 --> 00:26:20.470
Why should we quarrel between ourselves?

00:26:21.190 --> 00:26:22.390
Is it not a time to...

00:26:22.390 --> 00:26:23.990
It's a time for us to act.

00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:28.309
And act quickly before we suffer another such defeat as our valiant man.

00:26:28.309 --> 00:26:31.509
Oh my cousin, what's going to happen?

00:26:31.509 --> 00:26:33.430
May you have peace, Korra.

00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:34.869
Peace to you too, my brothers.

00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:38.630
We're growing restless, Korra.

00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:41.509
The defeat we have suffered at the hands of the Amalekites

00:26:41.509 --> 00:26:45.190
and the Canaanites have cost us to weave before Jehovah.

00:26:46.309 --> 00:26:50.230
But in account of Moses, Jehovah will not listen to our voice.

00:26:50.950 --> 00:27:06.839
Makes a show of goodness and of compliance with Jehovah's will.

00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:10.440
He uses persuasion rather than force.

00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:15.400
And by his secret cunning, it has become wickedly powerful.

00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:20.759
As he has exalted Aaron, his brother in the same way.

00:27:21.559 --> 00:27:22.920
Truly spoken.

00:27:24.119 --> 00:27:27.720
Though it is proper for the people to punish such men,

00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:32.680
even while they think their wicked designs are kid's seal from us.

00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:34.119
They should be punished.

00:27:34.119 --> 00:27:43.109
Ah, it's all there is nothing left for them to do.

00:27:47.109 --> 00:27:50.950
You son of Levi, hear me now.

00:27:50.950 --> 00:27:58.950
Is Moses able to give any just causes to why he has bestowed a priesthood on Aaron and his sons?

00:27:58.950 --> 00:28:06.549
To bestow that honor on one of the tribe of Levi.

00:28:07.269 --> 00:28:09.109
Am I not also of that tribe?

00:28:12.539 --> 00:28:19.430
Though taking upon myself that dignity of this high office,

00:28:20.710 --> 00:28:25.109
unless it were urged upon me by the people,

00:28:25.109 --> 00:28:37.220
determined to bestow this honor on the tribe of the firstborn.

00:28:38.259 --> 00:28:41.140
This summer from the tribe of Rubin would have it justly.

00:28:42.099 --> 00:28:44.259
The day thing and the fire in what happened.

00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:47.619
We're there, the oldest men of the tribe of Rubin.

00:28:48.579 --> 00:28:49.619
Men of great wealth.

00:28:50.579 --> 00:28:51.380
Men of fame.

00:28:59.049 --> 00:29:11.529
Full assembly are up.

00:29:11.529 --> 00:29:19.349
And Jehovah's Day should you lift yourselves up above the congregation of Jehovah.

00:29:20.789 --> 00:29:24.230
O Chora, both you and all those with you.

00:29:25.109 --> 00:29:30.390
These 250 men of the sons of Israel are chieftains of the assembly.

00:29:31.029 --> 00:29:32.950
Some in ones of the meeting men of fame.

00:29:33.670 --> 00:29:34.630
But in the morning,

00:29:35.430 --> 00:29:41.589
Jehovah will make known who belongs to him and who is holy and who must come near to him

00:29:41.589 --> 00:29:45.509
and whomever he may choose, this one will come near to him.

00:29:46.390 --> 00:29:46.869
Do this.

00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:53.829
Take fireholders for yourselves, you and your entire assembly and put fire in them

00:29:53.829 --> 00:29:57.829
and place incense on them before Jehovah tomorrow.

00:29:59.029 --> 00:30:03.349
And it must occur that the man whom Jehovah will choose,

00:30:03.349 --> 00:30:05.109
he is the holy one.

00:30:06.069 --> 00:30:06.869
It is well.

00:30:08.069 --> 00:30:08.950
It is well.

00:30:10.069 --> 00:30:12.069
Joshua, here I am, my lord.

00:30:12.710 --> 00:30:15.829
Nathan and a biome are not presently with this assembly.

00:30:16.710 --> 00:30:21.829
Go and ask them please to come up also that they may hear the word of Jehovah.

00:30:21.829 --> 00:30:22.710
As you say, my lord.

00:30:27.180 --> 00:30:29.420
Listen, please, you sons of Levi.

00:30:30.140 --> 00:30:35.819
Is it such a little thing for you men that the God of Israel has separated you from the

00:30:35.819 --> 00:30:42.940
assembly of Israel to present you to himself, to carry on the service of Jehovah's Tabernacle

00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:46.779
and to stand before the assembly and to minister to them

00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:52.700
and that he should bring you and all your brothers, the sons of Levi, with you near.

00:30:53.339 --> 00:30:56.859
So must you men also try to secure the priesthood?

00:30:57.660 --> 00:31:03.900
For that reason, you and all your assembly who are gathering together are against Jehovah.

00:31:04.619 --> 00:31:10.220
As for Aaron, what is he that you men should murmur against him?

00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:31.430
When, Joshua, have Nathan and a biome, the sons of Eliab come up?

00:31:31.430 --> 00:31:32.470
No, my lord.

00:31:32.470 --> 00:31:35.109
Here's the word of Nathan and a biome.

00:31:35.109 --> 00:31:36.950
We're not going to come up.

00:31:36.950 --> 00:31:41.430
Is it so little of thing that you've brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey

00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:46.390
to put us to death in the wilderness that you should also try to play the prince over us to the limit?

00:31:47.109 --> 00:31:51.269
As it is, you've not brought us up into any land that is flowing with milk and honey

00:31:51.269 --> 00:31:54.230
that you might give us an inheritance of field and vineyard.

00:31:54.230 --> 00:31:57.029
Is it the eyes of those men that you want to bore out?

00:31:57.910 --> 00:32:00.789
So they said, we are not going to come up.

00:32:04.970 --> 00:32:09.289
Old Jehovah, do not turn to look at their grain offering.

00:32:10.170 --> 00:32:15.130
Not one male ass of theirs have I taken away, nor have I harmed one of them.

00:32:15.130 --> 00:32:22.329
Cora, you and all your assembly, be present before Jehovah.

00:32:22.329 --> 00:32:26.170
You and they and Aaron, tomorrow.

00:32:27.049 --> 00:32:32.890
And it must occur that the man whom Jehovah will choose, he is the holy one.

00:32:33.529 --> 00:32:36.490
Yes, let Jehovah choose.

00:32:42.420 --> 00:32:45.380
Is enough of you, you sons of Eliab.

00:32:46.099 --> 00:33:02.970
Hi, very good.

00:33:02.970 --> 00:33:05.450
All you saw the fingers, all the different chords.

00:33:06.410 --> 00:33:08.089
Oops, let's try that again.

00:33:10.890 --> 00:33:11.450
My brother.

00:33:12.089 --> 00:33:13.049
Uncle Okina.

00:33:14.089 --> 00:33:20.009
By now, the men are assembling before the tent of meeting, before the face of Jehovah.

00:33:21.289 --> 00:33:24.329
This is a very sad day for a nation and our tribe, my brother.

00:33:26.009 --> 00:33:27.210
What's happening, father?

00:33:28.650 --> 00:33:30.730
We're waiting on a judgment from Jehovah, my son.

00:33:31.289 --> 00:33:34.250
Now, please go say with your mother, we'll finish your lesson a little later.

00:33:34.250 --> 00:33:35.130
Yes, father.

00:33:35.130 --> 00:33:35.930
Thank you, my son.

00:33:39.049 --> 00:33:41.690
Wait, thank you very much for helping me, my dear.

00:33:41.690 --> 00:33:43.369
Do you want to help me make a blanket?

00:33:43.369 --> 00:33:44.569
Can I pick the colors?

00:33:44.569 --> 00:33:45.369
Of course you can.

00:33:47.049 --> 00:33:48.490
Amzai, shim.

00:33:49.210 --> 00:33:53.369
Amzai, it pleases my heart greatly to see that you have enjoying Cora.

00:33:53.369 --> 00:33:56.170
You didn't present yourself before Jehovah, the tent of meeting.

00:33:56.170 --> 00:33:58.809
I wouldn't present myself as a candidate for the priesthood.

00:33:58.809 --> 00:34:02.410
Nevertheless, I don't oppose Cora and his assembly for their right to do so.

00:34:02.410 --> 00:34:04.650
I don't think you understand how serious this is.

00:34:04.650 --> 00:34:06.730
They're awaiting a sign from Jehovah himself.

00:34:07.369 --> 00:34:10.730
Moses hasn't revealed to us what it'll be, but I'm afraid our father's

00:34:10.730 --> 00:34:12.889
hactor presumptiousness isn't going to go unpunished.

00:34:13.530 --> 00:34:17.050
And now, Moses will present himself before the tents of Nathan and Abiram

00:34:17.050 --> 00:34:19.050
that they too might hear the word of Jehovah.

00:34:19.050 --> 00:34:21.530
I'd also hear what it is, Moses would say to him.

00:34:21.530 --> 00:34:25.289
I, from my part, don't deny Nathan and Abiram the right to do what they've done.

00:34:25.289 --> 00:34:28.809
But Amzai, they've denied the word of God spoken by Moses.

00:34:28.809 --> 00:34:30.730
Does Jehovah speak only by Moses?

00:34:31.369 --> 00:34:33.369
Are we also a part of Israel?

00:34:33.369 --> 00:34:37.289
How do you know Jehovah doesn't also speak through Cora, Nathan, and Abiram?

00:34:37.289 --> 00:34:38.409
They're older men too.

00:34:38.409 --> 00:34:40.170
They came with this out of Egypt.

00:34:40.170 --> 00:34:42.250
Isn't Moses a man just like us?

00:34:42.250 --> 00:34:46.250
Please, Amzai, beware of the rebellious talk of Nathan and Abiram.

00:34:46.969 --> 00:34:50.570
It would seem that Jehovah's preparing to answer those questions himself.

00:34:50.570 --> 00:34:55.289
You didn't send up with Cora, but how are you going to send when Nathan and Abiram are called to account?

00:34:56.170 --> 00:34:58.250
We shall see. We shall see.

00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:57.159
Turn aside, please, from before the tents of these wicked men.

00:35:57.159 --> 00:36:02.519
Cora, Nathan and Abiram, do not touch anything that belongs to them,

00:36:02.519 --> 00:36:05.159
that you may not be swept away in all their sin.

00:36:05.159 --> 00:36:06.599
He can't be talking about us.

00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:09.480
Uh-huh, and who else do we have here?

00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:11.320
The so-called sons of Cora?

00:36:15.050 --> 00:36:19.050
Have you also been taken in by Moses' fear-inspiring threats?

00:36:20.650 --> 00:36:24.300
You claim to keep the law.

00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:26.059
There's not the law, say, honor your father.

00:36:26.059 --> 00:36:27.500
Yes, you sons of Cora.

00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:29.179
Why are you not with your father now?

00:36:29.179 --> 00:36:35.139
And where it's Abiram?

00:36:35.139 --> 00:36:38.340
The first three demand exclusive devotion to Jehovah's.

00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:40.980
Jehovah himself is still in the midst of Israel.

00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:43.539
Separate yourselves while there is time.

00:36:43.539 --> 00:36:57.900
Among the tribe of Rubin, you exercise no authority here.

00:36:57.900 --> 00:36:59.900
You separate yourselves from our midst.

00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:22.679
By this, you will know that Jehovah has sent me to do all these deeds,

00:37:22.679 --> 00:37:24.280
that it's not of my own heart.

00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:29.000
If it's according to the death of all mankind, that these people will die,

00:37:29.719 --> 00:37:32.039
and with the punishment of all mankind,

00:37:32.039 --> 00:37:34.039
that punishment will be brought upon them,

00:37:34.679 --> 00:37:37.159
then it is not Jehovah that is sent.

00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:41.480
But if it's something created, that Jehovah will create,

00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:43.320
and the ground has to open its mouth,

00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:46.679
and swallow up them, and everything that belongs to them,

00:37:47.239 --> 00:37:49.480
and they have to go down alive into sheol,

00:37:50.119 --> 00:37:53.480
then you will know for certain that these men

00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:56.199
have treated Jehovah disrespectfully.

00:37:56.760 --> 00:40:20.869
And the earth went covering them over so that they perished from the midst of the camp.

00:40:22.150 --> 00:40:24.070
And fire came out from Jehovah,

00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:27.750
and proceeded to consume your grandfather,

00:40:27.750 --> 00:40:29.989
and the 250 men offering incense.

00:40:30.869 --> 00:40:33.429
These perished in the rebellious talk of Korah.

00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:40.940
This was one of the darkest times ever for our family,

00:40:41.659 --> 00:40:43.179
and really for the entire nation.

00:40:44.460 --> 00:40:46.539
It was something we didn't recover from quickly.

00:40:49.260 --> 00:40:49.980
So my son,

00:40:50.940 --> 00:40:53.900
that's why your father's face sometimes looks sad

00:40:53.900 --> 00:40:55.500
when we talk about your grandfather.

00:40:57.099 --> 00:40:59.659
I understand that now more than ever before, Uncle,

00:41:00.619 --> 00:41:04.300
but my son, we have to make sure that sadness

00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:06.619
doesn't cause us to forget what really happened here.

00:41:08.059 --> 00:41:13.019
My father and his companions actually rebelled against Jehovah's authority.

00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:17.099
Their envy, pride, and ambition led to rebellion,

00:41:17.179 --> 00:41:19.900
and in the end, they brought this honor upon themselves.

00:41:21.179 --> 00:41:24.619
My father saw glory, but his glory was short-lived.

00:41:26.059 --> 00:41:29.739
I'm glad, though, that my brothers and I took the right side of the issue.

00:41:29.739 --> 00:41:32.440
It must have been hard, though.

00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:34.760
Yes, it was.

00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:37.960
But that helps us to understand how important it is,

00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:41.559
that we not allow friendships or family

00:41:42.039 --> 00:41:46.440
to take priority over our relationship with Jehovah and our obedience to him.

00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:49.559
That's what fathers always told me.

00:41:49.559 --> 00:41:51.000
Hmm, yes.

00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:57.480
Ultimately, successful direction for us humans comes from Jehovah.

00:41:58.440 --> 00:42:01.639
We should trust completely in his choices of appointed ones.

00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:06.199
You see, respect for those whom Jehovah has appointed

00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:09.320
shows respect for Jehovah's authority.

00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:13.449
Thank you for sharing that with me, Uncle.

00:42:14.650 --> 00:42:16.650
It really helps you put all the pieces together.

00:42:17.610 --> 00:42:18.570
You're welcome, my son.

00:42:19.929 --> 00:42:21.530
Now, what do you say we get back to our arrangement?

00:42:22.250 --> 00:42:22.969
Let's see.

00:42:22.969 --> 00:42:23.690
Where do we stop?

00:42:24.969 --> 00:42:27.210
We were at the beginning of the second verse, Uncle.

00:42:27.210 --> 00:42:28.010
Ah, yes.

00:42:28.010 --> 00:42:28.570
Here we are.

00:42:29.769 --> 00:42:30.090
Ready?

00:42:31.289 --> 00:42:31.769
Ready.

00:42:32.170 --> 00:42:32.489
Go.

00:43:13.750 --> 00:43:20.869
A tragic lesson for those involved in the rebellion and a costly one for the nation of Israel.

00:43:22.150 --> 00:43:28.389
As you watched these events unfold, with which drama character did you identify?

00:43:29.590 --> 00:43:36.389
It is easy to say that we would be just like the sons of Korah rather than to be like their

00:43:36.389 --> 00:43:38.949
father are like days in an abiram.

00:43:40.070 --> 00:43:48.469
But which drama characters best represent who we are in the deep recesses of our heart?

00:43:49.989 --> 00:43:51.510
Jude, verse 11 says,

00:43:52.309 --> 00:43:57.269
Too bad for those who have perished in the rebellious talk of Korah.

00:43:58.230 --> 00:44:02.550
Yes, the negative talk of Korah had infected others.

00:44:03.510 --> 00:44:11.190
Sadly, some in the Christian congregation today have lent an ear to the rebellious and poisonous talk

00:44:11.190 --> 00:44:14.150
of those who do not respect Jehovah.

00:44:15.110 --> 00:44:21.829
Perhaps swayed by that person's years of dedicated service or by his prominence in the congregation.

00:44:22.949 --> 00:44:30.389
But we should remember that Korah 2 had been a long time loyal servant of God.

00:44:31.349 --> 00:44:39.269
So to glibly say, I am loyal is not an assurance that we will be obedient and submissive.

00:44:40.389 --> 00:44:47.829
It is too bad that some in modern times have perished spiritually because of the influential thinking

00:44:47.829 --> 00:44:49.110
of treacherous hearts.

00:44:50.309 --> 00:44:55.750
Respecting Jehovah's authority also involves another important factor, loyalty.

00:44:56.710 --> 00:45:02.150
How many different aspects of loyalty did you count in the drama?

00:45:03.110 --> 00:45:06.710
Two, three, five?

00:45:07.909 --> 00:45:14.949
There were six different areas where in Korah and the other rebels failed the test of loyalty.

00:45:16.949 --> 00:45:20.710
First, they did not loyally support Godly authority.

00:45:21.670 --> 00:45:22.869
So am I?

00:45:22.869 --> 00:45:24.469
Whose will is actually carried out?

00:45:25.030 --> 00:45:27.670
That of Moses or that of Jehovah?

00:45:27.670 --> 00:45:29.110
Supposedly Jehovah's will.

00:45:31.340 --> 00:45:36.699
Isn't it clear, then, am I, that both Moses and Aaron have not arbitrarily lifted themselves

00:45:36.699 --> 00:45:37.980
up above the congregation?

00:45:38.699 --> 00:45:43.260
And if anyone objects to their authority, you and someone who in the past has been faithful and loyal?

00:45:43.739 --> 00:45:46.460
Whose authority do you think he's actually challenging?

00:45:46.460 --> 00:45:49.099
Well, I know I have to answer Jehovah's authority.

00:45:49.099 --> 00:45:51.980
However, in my eyes, Moses' leadership is a failure.

00:45:54.019 --> 00:46:01.380
As back then, today, Jehovah appoints imperfect men to take the lead in the congregation.

00:46:01.940 --> 00:46:09.059
Of necessity, then, loyalty to Jehovah means to avoid resisting the decisions of elders in the

00:46:09.059 --> 00:46:16.260
congregation. We must believe that Jehovah is aware of all issues and circumstances.

00:46:17.059 --> 00:46:18.900
Oftentimes, we are not.

00:46:21.190 --> 00:46:22.789
What was the second test?

00:46:23.750 --> 00:46:27.110
You son of Levi, hear me now.

00:46:28.309 --> 00:46:35.030
Is Moses able to give any just causes to why he has bestowed a priesthood on Aaron and his sons?

00:46:36.150 --> 00:46:42.699
God has determined to bestow that honor on one of the tribe of Levi.

00:46:43.340 --> 00:46:45.179
Am I not also of that tribe?

00:46:48.619 --> 00:46:55.579
Though I have not taken upon myself the dignity of this high office,

00:46:56.539 --> 00:47:01.340
unless it were urged upon me by the people.

00:47:04.340 --> 00:47:10.260
We need to counteract the spiritual viruses of pride, ambition, or jealousy.

00:47:10.980 --> 00:47:14.099
What is the antidote to such destructive motives?

00:47:14.980 --> 00:47:18.659
Love, because love does not get puffed up.

00:47:20.340 --> 00:47:25.699
The next test of loyalty involved the rebel's reaction to the deficiencies of Moses and Aaron.

00:47:27.619 --> 00:47:30.260
Would you three claim that Moses and Aaron are always right?

00:47:30.820 --> 00:47:32.260
Don't they make mistakes?

00:47:32.260 --> 00:47:36.099
Of course they do, because obviously they're imperfect men like the rest of us.

00:47:36.739 --> 00:47:40.019
Jehovah surely is aware of their mistakes more than any of us.

00:47:40.019 --> 00:47:45.059
Like, when Moses got married to that Kushite woman, it's a disgrace that we're led by a man whose

00:47:45.059 --> 00:47:46.900
wife is not even a daughter of Abraham.

00:47:48.659 --> 00:47:52.900
When we come face to face with the imperfections of those with responsibility,

00:47:53.539 --> 00:47:54.659
how do we react?

00:47:55.619 --> 00:48:00.260
In the fourth chapter of Ephesians, gifts in men, yes, in perfect men,

00:48:00.980 --> 00:48:04.739
are for the purpose of readjusting us and building us up.

00:48:05.380 --> 00:48:06.500
Verse 13 says,

00:48:07.059 --> 00:48:15.139
Until we all attain to a full grown man, to the measure of stature that belongs to the fullness of the

00:48:15.139 --> 00:48:23.619
Christ. As a human, Jesus loyally supported Jehovah's arrangement, even though the deficiencies of

00:48:23.619 --> 00:48:26.500
those around him were readily apparent.

00:48:27.860 --> 00:48:34.179
Fourth, despite the fact that Jehovah had protected and sustained them, the nation of Israel began to

00:48:34.179 --> 00:48:50.789
murmur and complain. Let us appoint a head and let us return to Egypt!

00:48:52.150 --> 00:48:56.789
Be of good courage, my brother. Do not condemn God as having told you lies?

00:48:56.789 --> 00:49:01.190
Trust in Jehovah to help us and follow those whom he has appointed as leaders,

00:49:01.190 --> 00:49:06.230
even Moses and Aaron. Do not listen to them. These men deserve to die.

00:49:08.420 --> 00:49:14.500
In the congregation today, a complaining spirit is easy to spot in others,

00:49:15.139 --> 00:49:22.500
but it can be transparent when we are the source. We need to submerge and drown all

00:49:22.500 --> 00:49:28.980
complaining and murmuring. The Apostle Paul urged Christians to keep doing all things free

00:49:29.059 --> 00:49:35.460
from murmurings. Unlike the Israelites, we should not lose sight of the fact that the

00:49:35.460 --> 00:49:42.579
temporary inconveniences we experience in this system are minor when compared with the rich

00:49:42.579 --> 00:49:49.780
blessings of God's new world. What did you identify as the fifth test of loyalty?

00:49:49.780 --> 00:49:54.900
Moses and his clan. It's time to act. What happened to leadership in our nation?

00:49:55.460 --> 00:49:59.139
I don't believe that Moses enjoys the confidence of the people anymore.

00:49:59.860 --> 00:50:03.219
And then when you think of the appointment of his brother Aaron as high priest,

00:50:03.219 --> 00:50:09.059
that makes you sick. My brothers, you are right. The next high priest would be half my age.

00:50:10.099 --> 00:50:14.900
Moses did not even consider me worthy to be head of our own family, the co-thites.

00:50:14.900 --> 00:50:21.059
He appointed Eli Zafan and man younger than me. Because it's just by Moses along that Jehovah's

00:50:21.059 --> 00:50:30.409
speak. Remember Cora was upset at the thought of a younger man being given more responsibility

00:50:30.409 --> 00:50:37.449
than himself. So although Cora desired more privileges, it was for the wrong reasons.

00:50:38.010 --> 00:50:43.929
On the other hand, his sons were content to serve merely as assistance to the priests.

00:50:45.289 --> 00:50:51.610
It is a beautiful thing to see loyal ones who have learned to blossom in the soil

00:50:51.690 --> 00:51:00.789
where they are planted. The sixth and final lesson learned from the drama can be a difficult test

00:51:00.789 --> 00:51:08.389
of loyalty. You're among a tribe of Rubin. You exercise no authority here. You separate yourself

00:51:08.389 --> 00:51:29.989
from our midst. The sons of Cora suffered the loss of their father and other close friends

00:51:29.989 --> 00:51:36.070
and family members. Today, Christians may suffer painful personal losses too,

00:51:37.030 --> 00:51:44.230
but friendships or family ties should never take precedence over our loyalty to God.

00:51:45.110 --> 00:51:51.670
It can be difficult to bring the wrongdoing of a friend to light, or to support the elders

00:51:51.670 --> 00:52:00.469
as they readjust a family relative. However, Psalm 1825 says, with someone loyal,

00:52:00.550 --> 00:52:09.849
Jehovah will act in loyalty. So again, we ask, which drama character did you identify with?

00:52:11.369 --> 00:52:18.570
Deep within your person. Throughout our lives, we will have opportunities to evaluate ourselves

00:52:18.570 --> 00:52:25.849
on this matter. So the next time things do not go as you expect, analyze what you feel

00:52:26.570 --> 00:52:35.610
surfacing from deep inside, a tendency toward murmuring, is pride pushing away good motive?

00:52:37.289 --> 00:52:46.090
Are we subtly taking on the character of Cora, Nathan, or a Byron? Instead, may we all identify

00:52:46.090 --> 00:52:53.130
with the sons of Cora, like the nation of Israel we are poised at the threshold of God's new world.

00:52:54.010 --> 00:53:00.650
Before entering, you may face issues that test your loyalty, even affecting your life and that

00:53:00.650 --> 00:53:08.409
of your family. Be determined to stay focused on the bigger issue of God's sovereignty. Yes,

00:53:08.969 --> 00:53:15.369
respect Jehovah's authority. In so doing, you have the prospect of becoming perfect sons and

00:53:15.369 --> 00:53:23.610
daughters of Jehovah, being showered with his blessings for all eternity.
