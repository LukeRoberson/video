00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:08.210
impossible. It will never happen. Not in a million years. Have you ever thought

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:13.330
that way about someone coming into the truth? Well, that might be our limited view

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:19.489
of a person. But how does Jehovah view him or her? And what is his view of all

00:00:19.489 --> 00:00:27.789
humans, even faithless ones? Notice his limitless view at 1 Timothy chapter 2

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:34.030
in verse 4. There it says, whose will is that all sorts of people should be saved

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:41.789
and come to an accurate knowledge of truth. So what is Jehovah's desire? It's his

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:48.630
will that all hear the message and be allowed to make changes and be saved. Now to

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:53.630
us that might be impossible, but we know with God all things are possible. He

00:00:53.630 --> 00:01:00.070
can stir the heart and he can motivate anyone. While it's true that faith is not

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:05.909
the possession of all people, it is a possession of millions around the world and

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.950
it can be for those who choose to acquire it. We know the Bible contains many

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:17.150
examples of men and women who at one time lacked faith, but later acquired it.

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:24.069
And the same is true today. It's not impossible. This symposium will help us

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:31.109
to remember this fact. Faithless people can acquire faith if we have Jehovah's

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:38.230
view and allow all sorts of people to hear God's word and make adjustments. We

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:45.069
will discuss four groups of people in this symposium, the Ninevites, Jesus

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:51.189
fleshly brothers, prominent ones, and non-religious people. And in each one of

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:56.030
these symposium talks, we'll consider what help former unbelievers to acquire

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:02.989
faith and what we can learn. First, let's consider the example of the Ninevites.

00:02:02.989 --> 00:02:08.310
As you recall, they are a Syrians or were a Syrians who lived in the capital

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.750
city of Ninevah and was founded by Nimrod. It was referred to as the city of

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:19.069
bloodshed. With that history and backdrop, we can imagine what the people were

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:26.469
like. They worshiped gods of war. War was their religion. Yes, they were aggressive,

00:02:26.469 --> 00:02:30.909
they were violent people, and they took pleasure in sadistically torturing

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:35.949
their captives. Well, their reputation was known by all the surrounding nations

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:41.789
including God's people. So that's why Jehovah sent his prophet Jonah to go

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:48.229
there and proclaim their destruction. As we noticed this first video, imagine how

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:51.830
Jonah must have felt going into Ninevah, going through the streets and

00:02:51.830 --> 00:04:10.199
observing the people of Ninevah, contemplating his warning message. How did

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:16.040
Jonah view his assignment? Well, at this time he did not have Jehovah's view. He

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:20.240
was afraid of the Ninevites, maybe what they thought of him or what they would

00:04:20.439 --> 00:04:26.600
do once they heard his message. Well, Jonah was human. He had feelings like ours.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:32.720
A human tendency is to judge people on what we see or what we hear about them. If

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:38.839
you were alive then and Jehovah gave you this assignment instead of Jonah, how

00:04:38.839 --> 00:04:42.800
might you have reacted? Would you have thought about the Ninevites and their

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:48.000
cruelty and their wickedness and say, they can change or would you feel it's

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:54.160
impossible? It'll never happen. Not in a million years. Well, that's how Jonah

00:04:54.160 --> 00:05:00.560
felt. But Jehovah corrected his view of his assignment as well as the people.

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:06.160
And he took that message and that counsel from Jehovah to heart and he

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:12.120
proclaimed the message to the people of Ninevah. He certainly got the Ninevites

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.199
attention, but he might have thought to himself, well, this is the end for me.

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:26.889
But how did they respond? Notice Jonah chapter 3 and verse 5. It says, and the men

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:33.449
of Ninevah put faith in God. So this surprise even Jonah himself, the king made

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:38.009
a proclamation for all the people what they should do to demonstrate their faith.

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:44.810
Notice verse 8 says, let them be covered with sackcloth, both man and beast, and let

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:50.089
them call out earnestly to God and turn from their evil ways and from the

00:05:50.089 --> 00:05:55.250
violence they practice. Who knows whether the true God may reconsider what he

00:05:55.250 --> 00:06:03.089
intends to do and turn from his burning anger so that we may not perish? What

00:06:03.089 --> 00:06:09.290
helped the Ninevites to change to acquire faith? It was a direct result of

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:15.850
Jonah accomplishing his assignment, boldly preaching God's message. They were

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:22.689
given the opportunity to change and to Jonah's surprise, they did. But Jonah had

00:06:22.689 --> 00:06:27.170
to make changes too. He had to take his limited view of his assignment and the

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:32.209
people and change it to the limitless view that Jehovah had, that people can

00:06:32.209 --> 00:06:38.649
change and Jehovah can stir their hearts. And Jonah had to look at himself and

00:06:38.649 --> 00:06:44.170
re-look at his assignment. He was not the judge, he was not the jury, he was a

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:50.689
messenger. Having Jehovah's view changes everything. How we view others, how we

00:06:50.689 --> 00:06:56.930
view ourselves, how we view our assignments today. We are ministers who have a

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:04.209
message. We're not the judges. Well, Jehovah is the judge and how did he judge

00:07:04.209 --> 00:07:11.250
the Ninevites worthy of being saved and have his mercy? Notice, Jonah chapter

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:18.250
three and they're in verse 10. It says, when the true God saw what they did and

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:23.490
how they had turned back from their evil ways, he reconsidered the calamity that

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:31.139
he said he would bring on them and he did not bring it. In the following video

00:07:31.180 --> 00:08:24.389
notice the changes that the Ninevites made and how they benefited. Are you Jonah?

00:08:24.389 --> 00:08:39.720
I am. Thank you. Well, the Ninevites certainly changed from the first video

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:44.639
that we watched. Changes they made on the inside allowed them to make changes

00:08:44.639 --> 00:08:48.879
on the outside, how they viewed their fellow Ninevites and how they treated them.

00:08:48.879 --> 00:08:55.679
Even their dispositions changed from gloomy unhappy faces to smiling, happy

00:08:55.679 --> 00:09:01.039
ones. They were appreciative of Jonah's warning message as well as Jehovah's

00:09:01.039 --> 00:09:08.559
mercy. What's the lesson for us? The same lesson that Jonah learned. We need to

00:09:08.559 --> 00:09:14.080
show compassion as Jehovah does. This means more than just noticing that someone

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:19.759
needs help, but taking the time and having the desire to try to relieve that

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:27.039
pain helped them. How can we imitate Jehovah's compassion today? It's by putting

00:09:27.039 --> 00:09:33.840
compassion into action and we do this by our preaching and we do this to all

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:39.759
persons giving them an opportunity to change and not be judgmental by viewing

00:09:39.759 --> 00:09:46.639
them as potential sheep as our future brother or sister. Like the Ninevites,

00:09:46.639 --> 00:09:51.919
many today are taught wrong beliefs and attitudes from childhood and it may be

00:09:51.919 --> 00:09:58.399
difficult to change but not impossible. What can help them change?

00:09:58.399 --> 00:10:07.200
Hebrews 412 says the word of God can help. The word of God is alive and exerts power.

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:13.279
Many of us are living proof of the Bible's power to change us. Before learning

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:20.240
the truth, some of us might have been violent, immoral, faithless. But as the Apostle Paul says,

00:10:20.879 --> 00:10:28.080
that is what some of you were. They change back then. People are changing today with the help

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:34.320
of God's Word and His Holy Spirit. We can help others change. We cannot read hearts,

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:39.840
but we know that Jehovah can and he can stir the heart, motivate anyone.

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:49.519
What can we do in the meantime? We can remember to follow what Romans chapter 10 and verse 16 says,

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:54.240
our assignment is to be a messenger. Notice verse 16,

00:10:55.600 --> 00:11:00.000
nevertheless, they did not all obey the good news. For Isaiah says,

00:11:00.559 --> 00:11:06.559
Jehovah, who has put faith in the thing heard from us? So faith follows the thing heard.

00:11:07.519 --> 00:11:12.960
In turn, what is heard is through the word about Christ. Faith follows the things heard.

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:19.279
What motivated the Ninevice to change, it was only after they heard Jonas' warning message.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:26.399
It is our hope and prayer that many will put faith in God because of the warning message that we give.

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:33.360
So may we be like Jonah, be compassionate, but bold, and preaching the good news to all.

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:40.159
And who knows, faith may follow the things heard. Remember, it is possible.

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:44.159
Faithless people can acquire faith.

00:11:45.759 --> 00:11:50.159
Brother Mark Sanderson, a member of the governing body, will now consider the next part of this

00:11:50.159 --> 00:12:02.320
symposium. Remember, faithless people can acquire faith, Jesus, fleshly brothers.
