00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:24.399
Samuel was only my age when Jehovah spoke to him.

00:00:24.399 --> 00:00:28.399
He respected Eli but he had to stand up for what's right.

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:41.219
I never thought that I'd have to do something similar.

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:48.299
I loved my brother and I always wanted to be like him.

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:52.299
But those pictures of him partying with kids from school

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:58.250
showed he was living a double life.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.250
I didn't want to get him in trouble.

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:10.760
I knew I had to say something.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:28.640
I told him he had to tell mom and dad.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:40.859
He warned me not to tell him.

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:44.859
But Samuel was courageous and did not hide anything.

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:58.799
And Jehovah himself was with him.

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:08.770
I couldn't hide this.

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:10.770
Talking to my parents wasn't easy.

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:16.520
But I knew it was the right thing to do.

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:27.550
Of course we were proud of Danny.

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.500
But...

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.500
At the time we were a little distracted.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.500
Maybe somehow it was all just a misunderstanding.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:52.050
We needed to know what was going on.

00:02:52.050 --> 00:03:07.069
We just wanted to help him.

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:19.159
We couldn't help but blame ourselves for what was happening.

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:32.240
Then we thought back to Samuel's example.

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:39.750
Samuel, you need to listen to us.

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.750
You're getting old, Samuel.

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.750
And your sons are not like you.

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.750
They cheat and they take pride.

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.750
Look, Vangel, it was rules.

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.750
Any way they please.

00:03:51.750 --> 00:04:04.530
Even Faithful Samuel had sons who deviated from Jehovah's standards.

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.969
We wanted to help our son.

00:04:07.969 --> 00:04:10.969
Just as Samuel didn't alter his course.

00:04:10.969 --> 00:04:12.969
And Jehovah stood by him.

00:04:12.969 --> 00:04:21.019
We knew if we did things his way, he'd stand by us.
