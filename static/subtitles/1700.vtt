00:00:19.089 --> 00:00:23.089
I sweated blood to train myself in martial arts.

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:30.100
So when I joined a big competition, I won the fight.

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.100
My life changed.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.100
I became a bodyguard of a well-known politician

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.100
and taught martial arts to some popular celebrities.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.090
My students, my boss, and his family,

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:53.960
they all became part of my life.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.960
But I was still looking for something.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:11.250
One day, some Jehovah's Witnesses came by and gave me a tract.

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:18.459
I was surprised and really happy to learn God's name.

00:01:18.459 --> 00:01:23.459
I thought this could be what I've been looking for.

00:01:23.459 --> 00:01:32.019
So I accepted a Bible study and I realized that I owed everything to God.

00:01:32.019 --> 00:01:49.650
When I attended my first meeting, I saw how humble and caring the witnesses were.

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:59.500
But my neighbors made fun of me.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:05.159
I wanted to beat them because I knew I could.

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:15.599
I was ashamed that I couldn't do anything to defend Jehovah's name.

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:20.849
Then one morning, before going to the meeting,

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:25.849
for the first time, I approached Jehovah in prayer,

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:28.849
asking him to give me courage.

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:30.849
I couldn't do it alone.

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:39.050
After that prayer, I felt that Jehovah really strengthened me.

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:45.050
And I humbly told the neighbors that I was going to the Kingdom Hall.

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:54.340
Since then, I've always prayed to Jehovah when making decisions.

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.340
I needed to leave martial arts.

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:14.289
I had to quit my job as a bodyguard and stop carrying guns.

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:17.289
Doing his will wasn't always easy.

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:21.289
But Jehovah gave me the courage to do so.

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:29.789
My boss asked me to visit him.

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:34.789
He offered me a new car and doubled my salary.

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:41.030
His offer was very tempting.

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:47.030
So I went to the washroom and intensely prayed again to Jehovah for courage.

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:55.039
Jehovah, help me please, I said.

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:58.039
I can't do this on my own.

00:03:58.039 --> 00:04:07.419
In the end, I chose Jehovah.

00:04:07.419 --> 00:04:13.419
Jehovah is more precious to me than anything this world could offer.

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:16.420
I told him.

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:22.819
Sorry, but I'm not accepting your offer.

00:04:22.819 --> 00:04:28.000
It felt like losing a family and death.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Eventually, I got baptized.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000
I realized that it didn't matter what people thought about me.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000
It's how Jehovah sees me that matters.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Now, I am very grateful to be with the brothers in serving Jehovah.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:55.490
I am now serving as a regular pioneer.

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:59.490
And this is the life that I had been looking for.
