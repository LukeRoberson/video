00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:08.380
If money was no object, I would definitely get a car.

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:10.380
A really nice guitar.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.380
A nice mountain bike. A nice computer.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.380
A nice house.

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.379
A plane ticket to Fiji.

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:17.379
Nice wardrobe for a clothes.

00:00:17.379 --> 00:00:19.379
A week travel, travel, travel.

00:00:19.379 --> 00:00:20.379
A jet.

00:00:20.379 --> 00:00:23.379
A first class ticket to Brownwell.

00:00:23.379 --> 00:00:25.379
Technology as much as I can find.

00:00:25.379 --> 00:00:27.379
I'll get word in. All of it.

00:00:27.379 --> 00:00:37.030
Please, at least chapter 7 verse 12, says that money is for protection.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.030
We do need money in life for food, shelter and clothing.

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:46.030
But the rest of the verse just kind of is a thought that really wisdom is more important.

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:52.520
It's just all about keeping it in a balance.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:01:02.299
Spending uncontrollably is like driving blind because you don't know the consequences of your rational spending.

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:08.299
You really aren't even looking where you're going and you could potentially be heading to a disaster.

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:11.299
The Bible tells us to calculate the expense.

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:14.299
So we have to watch our spending.

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:22.299
I think that having a credit card can be a trap because you wind up spending money you don't have.

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:29.760
Pay your credit card bills as soon as possible, pay it in full.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:30.760
Don't.

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.760
Ever lend your credit card to a friend.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.760
That's just asking for trouble.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:41.760
If you can just control your initial reaction, if you resist,

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.760
when you finally get home, you can ask yourself, do I really need that?

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.760
I don't mean to.

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.760
It's always been the case where you go out.

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.760
You've got your goal in mind, something else catches your eye.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:59.760
And before you know it, you're leaving the shop with something that you might not have even knew existed.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.140
But now that you've seen it, you want to do.

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.139
It's extremely important to learn how to manage money while you're still at home.

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:12.139
If you left the house unprepared, it's like being thrown in the deep end of a pool and not knowing how to swim.

00:02:12.139 --> 00:02:14.139
Ultimately, you just drown.

00:02:14.139 --> 00:02:21.139
While you're at home, you have limited expenses, so that will allow you to focus on budgeting your funds.

00:02:21.139 --> 00:02:24.139
And then once you leave home because you practice that while you're at home,

00:02:24.139 --> 00:02:28.139
when you have additional things to spend on, you're going to be ready.
