00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:08.349
Now we'll be able to custom make some backgrounds that actually look like Bible lands.

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:14.349
And so the good news according to Jesus Project is the perfect candidate for the use of virtual production.

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:21.350
A video wall will be installed and ready for use at the Australasia branch in early 2024.

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:33.490
There's many formats out there in the world of Jesus' life and how it's depicted.

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:38.490
But how film is so accurate, the research and effort that's gone into it and has made it.

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:42.490
So close to the Bible, it's going to make such a difference.

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:46.490
They're going to see Jesus what he was truly like.

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:50.490
They're going to affect hearts and it's really going to help them to see Jehovah as well.

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:56.490
As we've been working with the good news according to Jesus Project, we've run into a few challenges to see the least.

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:02.490
Right from the start, we had fires, we've had floods, we've had a pandemic.

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:06.489
Due to a number of restrictions that were taking place at the time, things were delayed.

00:01:06.489 --> 00:01:09.489
They even came a point where it just completely starts.

00:01:09.489 --> 00:01:17.489
We did wonder how we were going to be able to produce this video and the time frames that we needed to do so.

00:01:17.489 --> 00:01:27.219
We had to pick and choose which scenes that we had to shoot first because construction was trying to keep up with our film schedule.

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:31.219
So trying to manage those two together was quite difficult.

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:35.219
Some of the challenges also are depicting miracles.

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:39.219
How are you going to depict some of the various illnesses and diseases?

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:46.219
How to film scenes like the miraculous catch of fish and Jesus walking on water in a realistic way?

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:57.219
It's a weighty responsibility, but there's also the amazing joy of being able to learn more about Jesus just through the process of trying to put it on film.

00:01:57.219 --> 00:02:02.219
The Bible accounts that we are trying to depict involve a lot of animals.

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:08.219
The weight was part of the culture at the time, so we're really trying to incorporate that into this production.

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:15.219
We've had donkeys, shape, pigeons, and even camels here at the branch on set.

00:02:15.219 --> 00:02:22.219
They need to be trained to work with actors, trained to be ridden. They need to be familiarized with the sets.

00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:27.219
You actually start to see a bond established between the animals and the actors.

00:02:27.219 --> 00:02:35.219
Fortunately, many of our brothers and sisters at work in farmlands and rural Australia had many of these animals that they were willing to make available for us.

00:02:35.219 --> 00:02:44.219
There's a sister in a nearby rural congregation that has volunteered to help raise the pigeons that we're going to use in the temple scenes and other areas.

00:02:44.219 --> 00:02:50.219
The shape loved to be around kids, and I love to be around the cost members, and it really does make a difference.

00:02:50.219 --> 00:03:00.259
All of those animals essentially lend themselves to the realism of the sets that we're in and help bring the Bible accounts to life.

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:04.259
So one particular episode required the Judean wilderness.

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:11.259
After reviewing a few options here within the country of Australia, we saw that it wasn't as feasible as we would have liked to put it to be.

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:17.259
After presenting the information to our brothers in oversight, we got a response that we didn't anticipate.

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:20.259
They came back asking, what about Israel?

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:26.259
A small crew traveled to Israel and actually filmed in the real Judean wilderness.

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:28.259
The local branch office provided support.

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:36.669
A number of scenes were filmed, and now when reviewing the material, we see Jehovah blessing that arrangement.

00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:41.669
The backlog is a huge film set. It has five historical areas.

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:44.669
We have the temple area and the temple slab.

00:03:44.669 --> 00:03:48.669
Jerusalem area. There's Kena, or Galilee.

00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:53.669
And then there's Capernaum, including a little beach area, and Nazareth.

00:03:53.669 --> 00:04:00.669
The backlog has roads, mounds, just landscapes so that we can have a variety of filming.

00:04:00.669 --> 00:04:03.669
It was designed in a way where you can point the camera anywhere.

00:04:03.669 --> 00:04:07.669
So it just helps you immerse yourself into the story and the life of Jesus.

00:04:07.669 --> 00:04:12.669
This is a world that you've never seen before.

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:18.670
What's different about those sets there in Australia that we're typically using here is they have to last a lot longer.

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:26.670
To cover the entire span of the gospel accounts requires many, many years of recordings.

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:30.670
The brothers and sisters, they've shown amazing skill.

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:33.670
And they've worked through some very challenging conditions.

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:37.670
We've had heat, we've had rain. It's been dusty out here.

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:41.670
It's been muddy at times, but they've worked through all of it.

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:49.670
And whilst the end product is this beautiful set, it's going to bring the ministry of Jesus Christ to life in an incredibly realistic way.

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:55.670
While construction was going, a contractor came in to the back lot to see the construction brothers.

00:04:55.670 --> 00:05:00.670
He spoke to one of the brothers and tears and asked what was this all about.

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:03.670
And we explained what we were trying to achieve.

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:06.670
And with tears, he said, I come from Israel.

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:09.670
And this looks just like my home.

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:18.670
Seeing someone who has no idea about this project to come in and see how accurate it was really shows me how Jehovah is really looking after this project.

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:23.670
It isn't any one of us that have made this a success. It's Jehovah the whole way.

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:28.670
As we study these Bible accounts and figure out ways to bring them to life on the screen,

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:32.670
it's teaching us to get into the motivations of who these people were.

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:42.670
Our goal is to take them from being just characters in black and white on the printed page into real people that you're going to know and love for the rest of your life.

00:05:52.339 --> 00:05:57.990
Roll camera, roll audio! Action!
