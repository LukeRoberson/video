WEBVTT

00:00:10.699 --> 00:00:13.539
I have to give you an A plus on that.

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:23.850
Well done, you may be seated now, please.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.690
We'll get to enjoy now the final talk on our program,

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:32.890
Brother Mark Sanderson of the Governing Body.

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.490
We'll give this talk and appropriately his theme,

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:41.689
how will you strengthen your brothers?

00:00:41.689 --> 00:00:45.280
Brother Sanderson.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:52.520
Jehovah is the great strengthener and stabilizer of his people.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.920
Even just by being present on this very, very happy occasion,

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.520
the graduation of the 140th class of the Watchtower Bible

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:08.560
School of Gilead, we feel Jehovah strengthening us.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:15.239
We feel fortified just by our presence at this wonderful event.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.280
But this truly is the will of God.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.879
It is Jehovah's will that his people should be strengthened,

00:01:24.879 --> 00:01:28.439
that they should be made strong in the faith.

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:34.519
And what a beautiful expression we read in Isaiah, chapter 40.

00:01:34.519 --> 00:01:38.280
Here, Jehovah expresses this in such beautiful words.

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.920
Isaiah 40 and verse 28.

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:45.920
Do you not know?

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.760
Have you not heard?

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.920
Jehovah, the creator of the ends of the earth,

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.719
is a God for all eternity.

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:57.079
He never tires out or grows weary.

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:00.920
His understanding is unsearchable.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.799
He gives power to the tired one.

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:07.480
And full might to those lacking strength.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.759
Boys will tire out and grow weary.

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.879
And young men will stumble and fall.

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:17.719
But those hoping in Jehovah will regain power.

00:02:17.719 --> 00:02:20.879
They will soar on wings like eagles.

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:24.000
They will run and not grow weary.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.360
They will walk and not tire out.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.479
Yes, Jehovah wants to strengthen his people.

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:37.639
And he has so many wonderful tools at his disposal

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:39.879
to accomplish that purpose.

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:43.039
But one of those wonderful tools,

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:45.599
one that he has used in such a mighty way,

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:49.840
is of course, the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.960
And back in 2011, you may know that the purpose of the Gilead

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.159
School was somewhat adjusted by the governing body.

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:02.240
So what is the purpose of the Gilead School today?

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.280
Well, here's what the governing body said.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.800
The school is to provide intensive training

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.639
to experienced and well-qualified special full-time servants

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:18.680
who have already proven that they are mature Christians.

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.800
These individuals will be in a fine position

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:28.680
to stabilize and strengthen the field and branch organization

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.360
and to help their brothers to learn

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:37.120
and to adhere to scriptural and theocratic direction.

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:42.800
Well, that's why you students of the 140th class are here.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.199
You're people just like that.

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:51.199
You are experienced and well-qualified special full-time servants.

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:54.280
And that is something your instructors have commented on

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.800
over and over again.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.080
Well, we're delighted to see that.

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:03.280
But now, on this day, when now you're going to graduate,

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.680
how appropriate it is for us to pause for a moment

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:13.240
and think, how will you live up to the purpose of your coming

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:15.919
to Gilead, the purpose of your schooling?

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:22.040
In other words, how are you going to strengthen your brothers?

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.240
Well, now let's talk about several simple things

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.120
that you can do to strengthen your brothers

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.360
when you return to your assignment.

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.800
Now, here's the first we're going to discuss.

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:41.560
You want to teach obedience, both by word and by example.

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:48.519
Now, when we discuss obedience, our minds immediately turn to Jesus Christ.

00:04:48.519 --> 00:04:52.639
In the insight volume, volume two, page 60,

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:57.639
under the subheading, his vital place in God's purpose.

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:02.759
Here's just a few comments that are made concerning Jesus.

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:07.160
It says, he was the central figure in the outworking

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:14.480
of all God's purposes, the focal point of all prophecies,

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:19.439
the solution to all problems Satan's rebellion raised.

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:22.639
He was the foundation upon which God

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:26.879
would build all future arrangements for the eternal good

00:05:26.879 --> 00:05:32.600
of his universal family in heaven and in earth.

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:37.959
Wow, what a tremendous role was assigned to Jesus.

00:05:37.959 --> 00:05:42.199
What a tremendous place he has.

00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:44.920
But in spite of that, in spite of the fact

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:50.720
that Jesus had this tremendous privilege given to him by Jehovah,

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:54.040
Jesus fully relied on his father.

00:05:54.040 --> 00:06:05.050
What did he say here in John chapter 12 and verse 49?

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:17.939
John chapter 12, verse 49, Jesus says,

00:06:17.939 --> 00:06:21.980
for I have not spoken of my own initiative,

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:26.100
but the father who sent me himself has himself given me

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:32.019
a commandment about what to say and what to speak.

00:06:32.019 --> 00:06:36.500
And I know that his commandment means everlasting life.

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:42.860
So whatever I speak, I speak just as the father has told me.

00:06:42.899 --> 00:06:44.459
Isn't it amazing?

00:06:44.459 --> 00:06:47.899
You know, in spite of the fact that Jesus had this huge place

00:06:47.899 --> 00:06:52.699
in Jehovah's arrangement, he was never self-willed.

00:06:52.699 --> 00:06:56.180
He never spoke of his own initiative,

00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:00.100
but as he said, he fully relied on his father.

00:07:01.339 --> 00:07:05.259
Well now, this was not just obedience in word.

00:07:05.259 --> 00:07:09.459
This was not just obedience in what Jesus taught,

00:07:09.459 --> 00:07:12.540
but this was obedience in everything that Jesus did

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:15.500
because at John chapter 8 and verse 29,

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:17.379
what did Jesus say?

00:07:17.379 --> 00:07:22.220
I always do the things pleasing to my father.

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:27.620
Well now, even when Jesus had come to a place

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:31.339
where obedience meant that he was going to have to die

00:07:31.339 --> 00:07:34.540
a very painful, agonizing death

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:37.420
that would bring humiliation before men,

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:41.699
we know Jesus did not waver for a moment.

00:07:41.699 --> 00:07:45.339
His obedience was rock solid.

00:07:45.339 --> 00:07:47.980
And in prayer in Matthew chapter 26,

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:50.180
what did Jesus say to his father?

00:07:51.779 --> 00:07:56.300
These beautiful words, Matthew 26 in verse 42,

00:07:57.939 --> 00:08:02.779
my father, if it is not possible for this to pass away

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:08.060
unless I drink it, let your will take place.

00:08:08.939 --> 00:08:13.699
Yes, Jesus, even when facing such a difficult situation,

00:08:13.699 --> 00:08:17.620
what was foremost in his mind being obedient,

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:21.379
fulfilling the will of his father?

00:08:21.379 --> 00:08:25.540
Well now, why was Jesus so concerned

00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:28.139
about obedience to his father?

00:08:28.139 --> 00:08:31.019
Why was this such an issue for him?

00:08:31.019 --> 00:08:35.340
Well, let's read what Jesus had said here in John chapter 14

00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:39.620
because this really helps us to understand

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:42.580
what is behind this obedience of Christ.

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:48.580
John 1431, Jesus says, but for the world to know

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:54.379
that I love the father, I am doing just

00:08:54.379 --> 00:08:57.899
as the father has commanded me to do.

00:08:57.899 --> 00:09:02.899
Well, you see, Jesus' obedience was not something mechanical.

00:09:03.139 --> 00:09:07.139
It was not a matter of just checking things off a list.

00:09:07.139 --> 00:09:12.139
It wasn't something petty, but it was completely related

00:09:12.299 --> 00:09:14.899
to his love for Jehovah.

00:09:14.899 --> 00:09:18.139
And he wanted to demonstrate that love

00:09:18.139 --> 00:09:21.580
by being completely obedient to everything

00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:23.259
that Jehovah had asked of him.

00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:26.659
But in demonstrating that obedience,

00:09:26.659 --> 00:09:31.019
Jesus taught us something about our love for God

00:09:31.019 --> 00:09:35.299
because in verse 21 here in this same chapter, John 14,

00:09:35.299 --> 00:09:36.740
what did Jesus say?

00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:42.379
Whoever has my commandments and observes them

00:09:42.379 --> 00:09:46.379
is the one who loves me.

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:50.419
Then he said, in turn, whoever loves me

00:09:50.419 --> 00:09:52.740
will be loved by my father.

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:57.740
And I will love him and will clearly show myself to him.

00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:00.379
Well, obviously, you see, obedience

00:10:00.419 --> 00:10:03.019
is so much more than just a simple act.

00:10:03.019 --> 00:10:07.899
It's so completely tied in to our love for God,

00:10:07.899 --> 00:10:12.899
to our love for Jehovah and even for his love for us.

00:10:14.539 --> 00:10:17.860
Well, it's no wonder then that Jesus continuously

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:22.100
talked about obedience and even in his great commission

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:25.620
in Matthew, chapter 28, verses 19 and 20,

00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:29.500
so often we just remember the basics of what Jesus said.

00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:32.220
We think about go and make disciples

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:34.740
and we think about baptizing them

00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:37.659
and we think about teaching them.

00:10:37.659 --> 00:10:40.019
But what was it that we were to teach them?

00:10:41.299 --> 00:10:45.980
Teach them to observe or to be obedient

00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:49.220
to all the things I have commanded you.

00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:53.860
Jesus knew that our obedience would lead to our being faithful

00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:57.460
and having a loving, wonderful relationship with God

00:10:57.460 --> 00:11:00.299
that would even lead to everlasting life.

00:11:00.299 --> 00:11:04.059
And as the congregations in the first century applied this,

00:11:04.059 --> 00:11:05.379
well, what was the result?

00:11:05.379 --> 00:11:09.059
You see, in Acts chapter 16, what does the Bible tell us?

00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:17.690
Acts 16 and verse four, as they traveled on through the cities,

00:11:17.769 --> 00:11:20.529
they would deliver to them for observance,

00:11:20.529 --> 00:11:24.169
the decrees that had been decided on by the apostles

00:11:24.169 --> 00:11:27.009
and the elders who were in Jerusalem.

00:11:27.009 --> 00:11:31.769
Then indeed, the congregations continued to be made firm

00:11:31.769 --> 00:11:36.769
in the faith and to increase in number from day to day.

00:11:37.009 --> 00:11:39.850
Well, you see, verse four, as they were traveling,

00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:41.490
you noticed that expression.

00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:44.529
They would not just deliver the decrees,

00:11:44.529 --> 00:11:48.330
but it says they would deliver them for observance.

00:11:49.289 --> 00:11:52.370
They would deliver them to be obeyed by the brothers.

00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:56.490
They would help them to be obedient to those directives

00:11:56.490 --> 00:12:00.769
and the result was spiritual prosperity.

00:12:00.769 --> 00:12:03.769
The congregations were made firm in the faith

00:12:03.769 --> 00:12:07.090
and they continued to grow from day to day.

00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:11.690
Well, brothers, what's the lesson that you want to learn

00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:13.889
about being obedient?

00:12:13.889 --> 00:12:17.409
Well, the majority of you are presently serving

00:12:17.409 --> 00:12:20.289
in branch offices and you're going to return

00:12:20.289 --> 00:12:24.370
and serve in branch offices around this earth.

00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:26.649
You're going to have an opportunity there

00:12:26.649 --> 00:12:30.370
to teach your brothers the beautiful lesson of obedience,

00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:33.970
but please don't go around giving lectures.

00:12:35.409 --> 00:12:37.370
Don't go around teaching everyone,

00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:39.769
telling them, you need to be obedient.

00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:46.450
But by your example, show your love for Jehovah

00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:49.330
by being obedient and your example,

00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:52.289
even in being obedient in small things,

00:12:52.289 --> 00:12:55.889
you can have such a powerful effect on others.

00:12:55.889 --> 00:12:57.570
This point was just brought home to me

00:12:57.570 --> 00:13:00.009
in a very unique way recently.

00:13:00.009 --> 00:13:02.210
I was with some friends at this special convention

00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:05.889
in Columbia and of course Monday and after the convention,

00:13:05.889 --> 00:13:08.129
we were all very tired.

00:13:08.129 --> 00:13:09.809
But yet we knew the right thing to do

00:13:09.809 --> 00:13:12.090
was to go out in the ministry.

00:13:12.090 --> 00:13:14.490
And so we went with a small congregation

00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:17.690
and went in door-to-door service.

00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:20.610
And as we were going from house to house,

00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:24.730
something was happening behind us that I never even saw.

00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:26.850
A brother and I were having a very nice conversation

00:13:26.850 --> 00:13:30.889
with a woman, but behind us apparently a car

00:13:30.889 --> 00:13:33.370
had pulled up with all tinted windows.

00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:34.809
And the brothers were very worried

00:13:34.809 --> 00:13:37.330
about what exactly this car was there for.

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:41.090
And so some of the brothers kind of got in between me

00:13:41.090 --> 00:13:42.090
and the car.

00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:46.450
And so when the man jumped out, they immediately asked him,

00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:48.730
well, sir, what do you want?

00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:50.450
What are you looking for?

00:13:50.450 --> 00:13:52.529
And the man said, well, you know,

00:13:52.529 --> 00:13:54.769
are you Jehovah's Witnesses?

00:13:54.769 --> 00:13:57.090
And they said, yes, we are.

00:13:57.090 --> 00:13:58.610
He said, well, you know, I used to study

00:13:58.610 --> 00:14:02.809
with Jehovah's Witnesses, but I don't study anymore.

00:14:02.809 --> 00:14:07.500
But I do watch JW Broadcasting.

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:10.500
Is that the man from JW Broadcasting?

00:14:16.629 --> 00:14:19.350
Well, the brother said, yes, it is.

00:14:20.950 --> 00:14:25.029
Well, the man says, you know, I cannot believe it.

00:14:25.029 --> 00:14:29.309
I cannot believe that those men on JW Broadcasting

00:14:29.309 --> 00:14:32.159
go from door to door.

00:14:32.159 --> 00:14:35.320
And so he not only made a very nice donation

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:39.720
to the organization, but he also said that he would be present

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:42.240
for the district or the regional convention

00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:44.759
that was to be held the next weekend.

00:14:44.759 --> 00:14:46.799
Well, you know, we were tired.

00:14:46.799 --> 00:14:48.000
We just did a simple thing.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.679
We went out in the ministry.

00:14:49.679 --> 00:14:51.840
We had no idea the effect it would have.

00:14:52.759 --> 00:14:56.120
So you don't need to do anything that's amazing

00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:57.679
or over the top.

00:14:57.679 --> 00:15:01.519
You see, just doing simple acts of obedience

00:15:01.519 --> 00:15:04.519
can teach our brothers so many wonderful things.

00:15:04.519 --> 00:15:09.120
Help them to be obedient, help them to love Jehovah

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:10.480
and you will strengthen them.

00:15:11.879 --> 00:15:14.639
Now, the second point I'd like to discuss with you

00:15:14.639 --> 00:15:19.480
is use your training and your abilities to build up

00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:21.759
and never to tear down.

00:15:22.759 --> 00:15:27.440
Now, the Apostle Paul was a tremendous strengthener

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:29.120
of God's people.

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:31.000
And you notice the comment that he made

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.200
in 2 Corinthians chapter 10.

00:15:34.559 --> 00:15:36.799
He makes this comment several times actually

00:15:36.799 --> 00:15:45.820
in the book of 2 Corinthians, but in chapter 10 and verse 8,

00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:49.779
he mentions about midway down the verse, this expression.

00:15:49.779 --> 00:15:53.980
He says, the authority that the Lord gave us

00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:58.980
to build you up and not to tear you down.

00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:01.820
Well, Paul was conscious of this.

00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:06.820
He wanted to use his words to build up and not tear down.

00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:07.899
Well, now, why is this something

00:16:07.899 --> 00:16:11.139
that you would want to consider right now before you go home?

00:16:12.419 --> 00:16:14.539
Well, while at Gilead, you have been surrounded

00:16:14.539 --> 00:16:17.740
by very mature, experienced men and women

00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:19.379
who are mature Christians.

00:16:20.379 --> 00:16:23.379
You've also had teaching from perhaps some of

00:16:23.379 --> 00:16:26.139
the best teachers that we have here in the organization.

00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:29.940
And you've been present in this marvelous,

00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:32.940
Bethel complex of Patterson that is run

00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:36.299
with such efficiency, just a wonder to behold.

00:16:37.259 --> 00:16:40.580
But you see now, you've been set up

00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:45.259
because now when you return home, oh my, how easy

00:16:45.259 --> 00:16:47.259
it will be to make comparisons.

00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:52.860
And if you're not careful, you could become a critic.

00:16:54.179 --> 00:16:57.940
Now this is something that we all need to be concerned about

00:16:57.940 --> 00:17:01.419
because in the world today, there is a very cynical,

00:17:01.419 --> 00:17:03.340
critical spirit.

00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:07.779
And we're not in any doubt as to who is behind this spirit.

00:17:07.779 --> 00:17:11.140
We remember that Revelation chapter 12, verse 10,

00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:13.059
describes Satan in what way?

00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:17.900
It says that he is the accuser of our brothers

00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:21.819
who accuses them day and night before our God.

00:17:21.819 --> 00:17:26.819
Well, what a disrespectful, what a contemptuous,

00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:30.579
scornful spirit the devil has.

00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:35.940
Well, sadly, because his spirit is so prevalent in this earth,

00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:37.740
people now today have come to think

00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:42.740
that a kind of cynical, critical attitude is almost intelligent.

00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:47.339
It's the sign of sophistication of being well educated.

00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:51.099
Well, brothers, fight that spirit.

00:17:51.099 --> 00:17:52.500
Fight against it.

00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:56.980
That critical spirit originates with Satan

00:17:56.980 --> 00:17:58.460
and not with Jehovah.

00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:03.619
To build up something meaningful, something even beautiful,

00:18:03.619 --> 00:18:05.140
takes time.

00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:06.700
It takes effort.

00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:08.539
It takes patience.

00:18:08.539 --> 00:18:10.380
It takes hard work.

00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:13.940
Not so with tearing down.

00:18:14.859 --> 00:18:16.859
It's not difficult to destroy.

00:18:17.859 --> 00:18:20.819
You can take a wrecking ball

00:18:20.819 --> 00:18:22.779
and you can look at the most beautiful building

00:18:22.779 --> 00:18:26.059
that took many decades and hard work

00:18:26.059 --> 00:18:28.779
and much intelligence to construct in a few minutes.

00:18:28.779 --> 00:18:32.420
You can knock it right down to the ground with nothing left.

00:18:33.859 --> 00:18:37.180
Well, brothers, don't use your talents that way.

00:18:38.019 --> 00:18:42.299
And if you ever feel tempted to let that wrecking ball swing,

00:18:42.299 --> 00:18:43.660
stop it.

00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:46.380
Stop it before it begins to swing

00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:50.059
so that you'll never, ever use your talents,

00:18:50.059 --> 00:18:53.259
your abilities, your training to destroy,

00:18:53.259 --> 00:18:55.380
or tear down others.

00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:58.339
In this regard, Job said something

00:18:58.339 --> 00:18:59.700
that we can really learn from.

00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:03.779
And this is where the New World translation really comes to life.

00:19:03.779 --> 00:19:07.180
This revised edition, we just love reading it, don't we?

00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:10.259
But the book of Job has just been opened up to us.

00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:14.900
And here in Job chapter 16 and verse four,

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:18.420
notice what Job says.

00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:20.819
He says to his comforters,

00:19:20.819 --> 00:19:23.900
I could also speak as you do.

00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:26.220
If you were in my place,

00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:29.740
I could make persuasive speeches against you

00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:31.539
and shake my head at you.

00:19:32.579 --> 00:19:34.660
When I'll think about this for a minute,

00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:37.980
you see, when you go back to your assignments,

00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:40.099
many of the brothers and sisters you'll deal with,

00:19:40.099 --> 00:19:42.059
of course, they haven't had the opportunity

00:19:42.059 --> 00:19:43.059
to go to Gilead.

00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:47.619
And many of them, they may be struggling with health problems,

00:19:47.619 --> 00:19:50.660
they may be struggling to try to look after their families,

00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:51.619
their children.

00:19:52.619 --> 00:19:55.980
So they're not going to have all of the advantages

00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:58.339
that you have had spiritually.

00:19:58.339 --> 00:20:02.019
Well, how easy it would be if they traded places with you

00:20:02.019 --> 00:20:04.180
for them to shake their head at you

00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:06.180
and be critical, like Job says.

00:20:07.259 --> 00:20:10.220
But what was the resolve that Job had made?

00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:12.940
You see here in verse five, he says,

00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:16.579
instead though, I would strengthen you

00:20:16.579 --> 00:20:18.859
with the words of my mouth

00:20:18.859 --> 00:20:23.059
and the consolation of my lips would bring relief.

00:20:24.019 --> 00:20:26.500
What a beautiful expression.

00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:29.380
Well, when you go home, you're going to see

00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:32.579
so many who can benefit from your love.

00:20:32.579 --> 00:20:35.819
Resist the temptation to criticize them.

00:20:35.819 --> 00:20:40.819
Resist the temptation to let that wrecking ball swing at them.

00:20:40.819 --> 00:20:44.619
But instead, use your training, use your abilities,

00:20:44.619 --> 00:20:48.819
use your talents to build up and strengthen your brothers,

00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:52.619
and as you do, you'll have a powerful effect on them

00:20:52.619 --> 00:20:55.140
and they will feel strengthened.

00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:57.140
You know, when I was especially pioneering

00:20:57.140 --> 00:21:00.019
in Newfoundland on the island in Canada,

00:21:01.339 --> 00:21:04.900
we were in an assignment that was very, very isolated.

00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:08.140
And in order to get some strength,

00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:09.700
we would always arrange our schedule

00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:13.859
so that on our work day, we would go to the next town

00:21:13.859 --> 00:21:17.259
where our nearest congregation was almost two hours away.

00:21:17.259 --> 00:21:19.299
And there, there was a special pioneer couple

00:21:19.299 --> 00:21:22.579
who had been special pioneering for decades.

00:21:22.579 --> 00:21:25.460
And we would go there and just have an inner change

00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:27.339
of encouragement with them.

00:21:27.339 --> 00:21:31.900
And the spiritual conversation, their experiences,

00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:34.740
the thoughts they had learned from their personal study,

00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:37.299
you know, it was just as though we were getting a shot

00:21:37.299 --> 00:21:39.619
in the arm and by the time we left,

00:21:39.619 --> 00:21:43.460
we felt strengthened and upbuilt.

00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:46.019
Well, you see, the organization, Jehovah's organization,

00:21:46.019 --> 00:21:50.539
has given you this training, this wonderful gift.

00:21:50.539 --> 00:21:52.380
Use it in that way.

00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:54.900
Use it to build up and strengthen the brothers

00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:56.059
wherever you go.

00:21:56.900 --> 00:22:01.900
And finally, be firmly rooted in Christ Jesus.

00:22:04.299 --> 00:22:06.819
You won't remember every lecture that you heard

00:22:06.819 --> 00:22:08.380
while you were at Gilead.

00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:09.859
You won't remember every thought

00:22:09.859 --> 00:22:11.740
that was discussed in every lesson.

00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:15.940
You probably won't remember this talk.

00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:20.099
But if Christ's example and his teachings

00:22:20.099 --> 00:22:25.099
have been deeply embedded into your mind and into your heart,

00:22:26.259 --> 00:22:31.259
then just like the roots of a plant, nourish and stabilize it,

00:22:32.259 --> 00:22:36.299
well, Christ's example and his teachings will nourish

00:22:36.299 --> 00:22:38.460
and stabilize you.

00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:42.740
And his example and his ministry will teach you

00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:46.140
what you need to do to strengthen your brothers.

00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:48.500
And whenever you're at a loss and you're trying to figure out

00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:49.779
what could I say?

00:22:49.779 --> 00:22:51.299
What could I do to help?

00:22:51.299 --> 00:22:54.140
You'll go back to those roots of Christ Jesus

00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:56.900
and he will teach you.

00:22:56.900 --> 00:22:59.900
And you will know exactly what to do.

00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:05.519
It's just as Paul said in Colossians chapter two,

00:23:05.519 --> 00:23:08.200
in Colossians chapter two in verse six.

00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:12.839
He said, therefore, just as you have accepted

00:23:12.839 --> 00:23:17.839
Christ Jesus the Lord, go on walking in union with Him,

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:23.440
being rooted and built up in Him and being stabilized

00:23:24.039 --> 00:23:28.079
in the faith just as you were taught at Gilead.

00:23:28.079 --> 00:23:30.799
No, sorry, just as you were taught

00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:34.960
and overflowing with thanksgiving.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.599
Well, remember, it is the will of Jehovah

00:23:39.599 --> 00:23:42.160
that his people should be strengthened.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.079
And Jehovah is allowing you to have the privilege

00:23:46.079 --> 00:23:49.160
to help him, to strengthen his people.

00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:51.440
How are you going to do it?

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:55.319
Teach obedience by word and by example.

00:23:56.599 --> 00:24:00.079
Avoid the tendency to become a critic.

00:24:00.079 --> 00:24:02.440
Use your training and abilities to build up

00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:07.440
and not to tear down and be firmly rooted in Christ Jesus.

00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:10.799
His example will always show you the way

00:24:10.799 --> 00:24:14.400
to strengthen and stabilize your brothers.

00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:18.039
We truly love each and every one of you.

00:24:18.039 --> 00:24:22.680
Major Jehovah, go with you, may he richly bless you

00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:56.269
as you work hard to strengthen your brothers.

00:24:56.269 --> 00:24:59.750
Well, that taught definitely strengthen us

00:24:59.750 --> 00:25:03.470
and gave us some practical ways we can strengthen others.

00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:05.509
Thank you very much, brother Sanderson.

00:25:06.509 --> 00:25:10.309
Well, at this time, we're going to share with you

00:25:10.309 --> 00:25:12.309
some greetings.

00:25:12.309 --> 00:25:16.910
And because of time, we're going to just read one sentence

00:25:16.910 --> 00:25:18.710
from each one of these beautiful greetings

00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:19.910
that we've received.

00:25:21.109 --> 00:25:23.509
So first, we have Angola.

00:25:24.910 --> 00:25:28.390
We wish that the graduates continue experiencing

00:25:28.390 --> 00:25:31.109
Jehovah's richest blessings in their assignments

00:25:31.109 --> 00:25:33.309
while they humbly serve others

00:25:33.309 --> 00:25:37.269
and reflect even better God's wonderful qualities

00:25:37.269 --> 00:25:39.029
in their lives.

00:25:39.029 --> 00:25:43.390
Argentina, we're very happy to send our love and greetings

00:25:43.390 --> 00:25:48.309

00:25:57.789 --> 00:26:01.269
in order to shoulder weightier responsibilities

00:26:01.269 --> 00:26:05.069
in the organization, Burundi.

00:26:05.069 --> 00:26:09.509
Your brothers extend to you, your family and guests,

00:26:09.509 --> 00:26:16.910
warmest Christian greetings from Burundi, the heart of Africa,

00:26:16.910 --> 00:26:18.150
Canada.

00:26:24.869 --> 00:26:27.430
and will make Jehovah's heart rejoice

00:26:27.430 --> 00:26:31.470
by living and sharing what you have learned.

00:26:31.470 --> 00:26:35.309
Central Europe, you dear graduates

00:26:35.309 --> 00:26:39.630

00:26:39.630 --> 00:26:42.109
and may you fill the realm of your assignment

00:26:42.109 --> 00:26:45.509
with this wonderful fragrance of truth leading

00:26:45.509 --> 00:26:51.910

00:26:56.789 --> 00:27:00.190
and deep love on the graduation program

00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:05.829
of the 140th class of Gilead, Dominican Republic.

00:27:05.829 --> 00:27:08.069
The Dominican Republic branch family

00:27:08.069 --> 00:27:10.869
sends its warmest love and greetings

00:27:10.869 --> 00:27:15.269
to the three graduating students from our branch

00:27:15.269 --> 00:27:23.589
and the entire class, glad they added that,

00:27:23.589 --> 00:27:28.230
and all assembled on this joyous day

00:27:28.230 --> 00:27:31.509

00:27:43.589 --> 00:27:47.190
Ghana, as you depart from your Gilead training,

00:27:47.190 --> 00:27:50.549
our sentiments toward you are similar to those expressed

00:27:50.549 --> 00:27:54.069
by Jesus when he prayed in behalf of his apostles

00:27:54.069 --> 00:27:57.230
that your faith may not give out

00:27:57.230 --> 00:28:00.509
and that you will strengthen your brothers.

00:28:01.349 --> 00:28:02.670
That sounds familiar, doesn't it?

00:28:02.670 --> 00:28:03.950
Strengthen your brothers.

00:28:05.269 --> 00:28:09.710

00:28:14.630 --> 00:28:17.269

00:28:47.309 --> 00:28:51.950
Korea, we along with 500 brothers in prison in Korea

00:28:51.950 --> 00:28:54.470
for keeping Christian neutrality

00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:59.150
pray that Jehovah richly bless you graduates.

00:29:02.430 --> 00:29:06.390
our worldwide search for his precious sheep

00:29:06.390 --> 00:29:10.670
and may this special occasion begin a new day

00:29:10.670 --> 00:29:15.829
for the 140th class of Gilead as they continue their search

00:29:15.829 --> 00:29:18.470
with even greater zeal.

00:29:18.470 --> 00:29:22.349
Macedonia, our hearts go out to you students

00:29:22.349 --> 00:29:27.349
and our feelings for you are well described in Colossians 1.9

00:29:27.630 --> 00:29:30.349
where it says, we pray for you,

00:29:30.349 --> 00:29:34.069
asking that you may be filled with the accurate knowledge

00:29:34.069 --> 00:29:38.589
of his will in all wisdom and spiritual comprehension.

00:29:39.589 --> 00:29:43.630
Micronesia, we are sure that your training has helped you

00:29:43.630 --> 00:29:46.349
to have a tongue of those taught

00:29:47.349 --> 00:29:51.109
and are even more qualified to answer the tired one

00:29:51.109 --> 00:29:54.829
with the right word, Isaiah 54.

00:29:55.910 --> 00:29:59.789
Mozambique, Gilead graduates have been sent

00:29:59.789 --> 00:30:04.789
to Mozambique since 1991, but now for the first time

00:30:06.190 --> 00:30:09.390
we had the privilege to send three brothers

00:30:09.390 --> 00:30:12.349
from Mozambique to this class.

00:30:13.470 --> 00:30:17.349
Philippines, the Philippines branch rejoices with you

00:30:17.349 --> 00:30:20.269
as you pass this Theocratic milestone

00:30:20.269 --> 00:30:24.950
and your life of service to him, Romania.

00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:28.109
While we wait for Jehovah to reveal his purpose,

00:30:28.109 --> 00:30:31.910
we are determined to walk with you in the spiritual light

00:30:31.910 --> 00:30:35.990
that he is abundantly pouring upon us.

00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:40.990
And one more, Russia, we are certain that you will enjoy

00:30:40.990 --> 00:30:45.990
richly, Jehovah's blessing and your assignments

00:30:46.509 --> 00:30:49.630
and be a source of strength and encouragement

00:30:49.630 --> 00:30:53.109
in your congregations and territories.

00:30:53.109 --> 00:31:08.940
Well, we're happy to receive those greetings.

00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:12.940
But now we're gonna get a look at the entire 140th class

00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:30.220
of Gilead, and you know one thing I've noticed,

00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:33.859
and if you look closely, you'll probably notice it too,

00:31:33.859 --> 00:31:38.019
that these 48 students look a lot smarter

00:31:38.019 --> 00:31:42.759
than they did five months ago.

00:31:42.759 --> 00:31:46.640
But now to give you an overview, here are a few statistics

00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:49.720
regarding this handsome class that you're looking at.

00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:56.440
We have 48 students, and among them, 16 married couples,

00:31:57.640 --> 00:32:02.240
12 single brothers, four single sisters.

00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:04.680
They come from 29 countries,

00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:08.559
and they're being assigned to 28 different countries.

00:32:08.559 --> 00:32:13.400
So these well-trained soon-to-be graduates

00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:16.400
are gonna be dispersed to the ends of the earth.

00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:21.400
The average age 42 and a half, how I'd like to be 42 again.

00:32:25.890 --> 00:32:30.329
Their average year's in the truth, 25.2.

00:32:30.329 --> 00:32:35.089
Their average year's in full-time service, 20.3.

00:32:35.089 --> 00:32:39.210
So they're relatively young, but they're quite experienced.

00:32:39.210 --> 00:32:42.450
Really, they've spent 80% of their time in the truth

00:32:42.450 --> 00:32:46.369
in the full-time service, 20 of their 25 years in the truth,

00:32:46.369 --> 00:32:49.930
20 years in full-time service,

00:32:49.930 --> 00:32:56.140
and I'm sure Brother Stovall will appreciate that statistic.

00:32:56.140 --> 00:33:00.619
On our table, you can see we have some envelopes,

00:33:00.619 --> 00:33:03.059
and these are not just ordinary envelopes.

00:33:03.059 --> 00:33:06.619
They contain your precious diplomas.

00:33:06.619 --> 00:33:09.500
There's also a class photo in there,

00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:11.539
and there's a letter of encouragement

00:33:11.539 --> 00:33:13.220
from the teaching committee.

00:33:13.220 --> 00:33:16.420
So at this point, we're gonna ask you to come up

00:33:16.539 --> 00:33:18.059
and get your envelopes,

00:33:18.059 --> 00:33:22.339
but Brother Ron Kursin, a helper to the teaching committee,

00:33:22.339 --> 00:33:23.900
is gonna help me.

00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:25.940
Now, he's got the hard part.

00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:28.900
So he's gonna pronounce all of the names properly.

00:33:30.539 --> 00:33:31.859
He's gonna get it right.

00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:37.099
And he's gonna mention where you're assigned.

00:33:37.099 --> 00:33:40.740
And really, all I have to do is hand the envelopes

00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:43.900
to them, shake their hands, and wish them Jehovah's blessing.

00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:46.819
Life is good.

00:33:46.819 --> 00:33:55.269
But one by one, we'll have our single ones come,

00:33:56.470 --> 00:34:00.109
and a couple by couple in the case of couples.

00:34:00.109 --> 00:34:04.710
So please, Brother Kursin, help me out.

00:34:04.710 --> 00:34:06.470
Let us begin.

00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:08.190

That's the easiest time I've ever done that.

00:38:57.110 --> 00:39:03.030
But it was really a pleasure to be able to give these special envelopes to these.

00:39:03.030 --> 00:39:05.110
We're going to call them now graduates.

00:39:05.110 --> 00:39:06.269
They no longer students.

00:39:06.269 --> 00:39:12.070
They've got their diplomas in their hands and their gillied graduates.

00:39:12.070 --> 00:39:19.389
And the governing body is so happy to be able to give these students, they worked hard

00:39:19.389 --> 00:39:26.550
and they've reached this theocratic milestone in their theocratic career.

00:39:26.550 --> 00:39:33.670
But now at this point, we're going to ask Brother Tony Tibedo to represent the class

00:39:33.670 --> 00:39:36.590
by reading the class letter.

00:39:36.590 --> 00:39:43.309
And really this will be Brother Tibedo's first assignment as a gillied graduate.

00:39:43.309 --> 00:39:56.989
So Brother Tibedo, please let us hear this letter that you've written.

00:39:56.989 --> 00:40:03.909
Dear members of the governing body and the Bethel family, Psalm 145, seven states, they

00:40:03.909 --> 00:40:08.909
will bubble over as they recall your abundant goodness and they will shout joyfully because

00:40:08.909 --> 00:40:11.590
of your righteousness.

00:40:11.590 --> 00:40:16.309
Five months of gillied school has filled us with many reasons to thank Jehovah for his

00:40:16.309 --> 00:40:18.030
goodness.

00:40:18.030 --> 00:40:22.670
The in-depth study of the Bible has touched our hearts, making us more determined to

00:40:22.670 --> 00:40:27.110
shout joyfully about our God, Jehovah.

00:40:27.110 --> 00:40:31.909
Having fellow students from all parts of the earth with a great variety of cultures, languages

00:40:31.909 --> 00:40:37.949
and backgrounds provided further reasons to thank Jehovah.

00:40:37.949 --> 00:40:43.030
The school has allowed us to observe firsthand how you dear brothers of the governing body

00:40:43.030 --> 00:40:49.869
show genuine humility, heartfelt devotion to Jehovah and a willingness to give of yourselves

00:40:49.869 --> 00:40:53.590
in behalf of the worldwide work.

00:40:53.590 --> 00:40:59.750
We want to thank each of you for taking time to personally visit us in our classroom.

00:40:59.750 --> 00:41:05.989
You instilled in us the importance of seeking God's direction and doing His will in all aspects

00:41:05.989 --> 00:41:07.829
of our lives.

00:41:07.829 --> 00:41:13.920
We are truly grateful for this opportunity.

00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:18.119
During our time here, you precious brothers and sisters of the Bethel family have faced

00:41:18.119 --> 00:41:25.360
considerable adjustments to your routine, your assignments and your work locations.

00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:31.519
Change can be intimidating, yet you handle these adjustments as spiritually mature people,

00:41:31.519 --> 00:41:34.320
fully supporting the direction given.

00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:38.679
This has made a deep impression on us and strengthening our confidence in theocratic

00:41:38.679 --> 00:41:40.360
order.

00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:44.360
Our love for you has truly grown.

00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:49.480
Despite these challenges, you still took time to show an active interest in us by your

00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:54.679
warm welcome, your loving support and your encouraging words.

00:41:54.679 --> 00:41:59.360
You have truly been gracious hosts.

00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:03.679
Some forty verse five highlights that Jehovah's wonderful works and his thoughts toward

00:42:03.679 --> 00:42:07.079
us would be too numerous to recount.

00:42:07.079 --> 00:42:12.920
The material we covered in our preparation at night, you dear instructors helped us to

00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:16.599
uncover in the classroom the next day.

00:42:16.599 --> 00:42:21.639
You're in sight and your enthusiasm for the material was evident in the way you directed

00:42:21.639 --> 00:42:27.239
our attention to Jehovah, His qualities and His Word.

00:42:27.239 --> 00:42:31.559
By drawing us out, you took us out of our comfort zone and helped us to make personal

00:42:31.559 --> 00:42:35.480
application in our thinking and our attitude.

00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:39.880
Since we only scratched the surface, we look forward to discovering more of Jehovah's

00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:47.440
wonderful works in the days to come by taking the time to meditate on each verse we read.

00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:53.199
Gilead has highlighted that all of us have a place in Jehovah's organization.

00:42:53.199 --> 00:42:59.440
Our role is to now humbly serve in that place, giving whole-hearted support to Jehovah

00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:02.320
and His organization.

00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:07.800
Five months have passed quickly and shortly it will be time to do what Jesus told his disciples

00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:10.679
at Matthew 2646.

00:43:10.679 --> 00:43:13.320
Get up, let us go.

00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:19.800
Jesus was determined to move forward, maintaining His integrity, whatever challenges He awaited

00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:21.119
Him.

00:43:21.119 --> 00:43:28.440
We too are determined to apply the many lessons we have learned from all of you and most importantly

00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:34.159
to imitate more fully the examples of Jehovah and Jesus.

00:43:34.159 --> 00:43:40.519
Now more than ever, our resolve is to do as stated at Psalm 10433.

00:43:40.519 --> 00:43:43.920
We will sing to Jehovah throughout our lives.

00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:49.519
We will sing praises to our God as long as we live.

00:43:49.519 --> 00:43:52.920
Our brothers and sisters, the 140th class of Gilead.

00:43:52.920 --> 00:44:25.530
Well, that was a beautiful letter and you say you enjoyed being with us for five months.

00:44:25.530 --> 00:44:27.809
We have to say it was mutual.

00:44:27.809 --> 00:44:34.329
We truly enjoyed having all of you with us for these five months and we truly prayed

00:44:34.329 --> 00:44:37.929
Jehovah's blessing on each and every one of you.

00:44:37.929 --> 00:44:43.369
But now in conclusion, I have five more minutes, according to our schedule, even though we're

00:44:43.369 --> 00:44:52.190
over time to speak just a little bit more to you graduates.

00:44:52.190 --> 00:44:55.949
Now I would like to talk about what we mentioned in the beginning.

00:44:55.949 --> 00:45:01.789
We mentioned three precious expressions that we encourage you to use generously.

00:45:01.789 --> 00:45:11.469
Well we'd like to add one more, one more precious expression and it is Jehovah loves you.

00:45:11.469 --> 00:45:16.349
We encourage you to generously use that expression toward others.

00:45:16.349 --> 00:45:23.190
Now think about it because of their experiences in life, many of our brothers have a hard

00:45:23.190 --> 00:45:27.909
time really understanding and truly appreciating how much Jehovah loves them.

00:45:27.909 --> 00:45:35.110
I mean, if you think about it, some even have a hard time thinking of a father in a loving

00:45:35.110 --> 00:45:41.829
way because of perhaps painful memories of their father treating them badly.

00:45:41.829 --> 00:45:49.510
Our three great enemies, Satan, this unloving world around us and our imperfect flesh

00:45:49.510 --> 00:45:56.789
make it a challenge at times for us to be assured of Jehovah's love for us.

00:45:56.789 --> 00:46:05.469
It's so easy to believe Satan's lies that were unloved and perhaps even unlovable.

00:46:05.469 --> 00:46:10.949
So our brothers, each and every one of them and each and every one of us, we need that

00:46:10.949 --> 00:46:12.949
reassurance, don't we?

00:46:12.949 --> 00:46:16.030
That Jehovah loves us, see.

00:46:16.030 --> 00:46:24.550
And those words are powerful in countering Satan's efforts to convince us otherwise.

00:46:24.550 --> 00:46:30.869
Think of the experience was in the watchtower, a life story of a brother named George Warren

00:46:30.869 --> 00:46:32.269
Chuck.

00:46:32.269 --> 00:46:33.269
That was interesting.

00:46:33.269 --> 00:46:40.670
He was just a young boy, he explains, 13 years old, and he was expelled from school because

00:46:40.670 --> 00:46:43.469
he wouldn't salute the flag.

00:46:43.469 --> 00:46:46.869
But he was happy because he kept his integrity.

00:46:46.869 --> 00:46:52.949
In fact, he couldn't wait to tell his congregation book study conductor about his integrity.

00:46:52.949 --> 00:46:58.230
His congregation book study conductor was a big pioneer brother named Ben.

00:46:58.230 --> 00:47:01.590
Now George describes what happened.

00:47:01.590 --> 00:47:02.590
Here's what he said.

00:47:02.590 --> 00:47:13.469
He said, when I saw him, Ben, in the kingdom hall, I shouted, I'm expelled from school.

00:47:13.469 --> 00:47:17.349
But I did not salute the flag.

00:47:17.349 --> 00:47:27.590
Then put his arm around me, smiled and said, for sure, Jehovah loves you.

00:47:27.590 --> 00:47:31.510
How those words motivated me?

00:47:31.510 --> 00:47:36.710
And then George describes how just a short time later he was baptized.

00:47:36.710 --> 00:47:40.110
So they had a powerful effect on this young man.

00:47:40.110 --> 00:47:42.389
There's another experience, it was very interesting.

00:47:42.389 --> 00:47:51.469
In the 2003 yearbook, a report from the Marshall Islands, it was about a missionary sister

00:47:51.469 --> 00:47:58.909
who was assigned or asked to study with an inactive sister to try to help her make some spiritual

00:47:58.909 --> 00:47:59.909
progress.

00:47:59.909 --> 00:48:03.510
But she wasn't really getting anywhere with this inactive sister.

00:48:03.510 --> 00:48:11.630
So the yearbook explains that she asked this inactive sister, how do you feel when others

00:48:11.630 --> 00:48:15.590
tell you that they love you?

00:48:15.590 --> 00:48:24.070
Not getting a response for a moment, finally Puzzle, she replied, no one has ever told me

00:48:24.070 --> 00:48:26.309
that.

00:48:26.309 --> 00:48:33.829
The missionary sister then leaned over, hugged her and said, I love you.

00:48:33.829 --> 00:48:37.190
And Jehovah loves you even more.

00:48:37.789 --> 00:48:43.070
Well, the yearbook explains that that inactive sister began to cry.

00:48:43.070 --> 00:48:46.110
Her attitude towards Jehovah was completely changed.

00:48:46.110 --> 00:48:48.590
She began to make spiritual progress.

00:48:48.590 --> 00:48:54.510
Reading the Bible daily, attending the meetings, she even began to auxiliary pioneer and

00:48:54.510 --> 00:48:56.909
later became a regular pioneer.

00:48:56.909 --> 00:49:01.869
And the yearbook explains that since then, she's been conducting many Bible studies, helping

00:49:01.869 --> 00:49:03.269
many people.

00:49:03.269 --> 00:49:07.150
And you can be sure she uses those words.

00:49:07.150 --> 00:49:10.510
Jehovah loves you with her Bible students.

00:49:10.510 --> 00:49:17.110
So please generously use those words to reassure our brothers.

00:49:17.110 --> 00:49:21.909
In fact, now we have four precious expressions, don't we?

00:49:21.909 --> 00:49:23.670
Well done.

00:49:23.670 --> 00:49:26.110
I'm sorry.

00:49:26.110 --> 00:49:28.309
I love you.

00:49:28.309 --> 00:49:31.070
And Jehovah loves you.

00:49:31.070 --> 00:49:35.630
We encourage you to generously use those in your assignments.

00:49:35.630 --> 00:49:44.829
And if you do, you're assured of Jehovah's promise at Proverbs 11, verse 25, Jehovah assures

00:49:44.829 --> 00:49:49.510
the generous person will prosper.

00:49:49.510 --> 00:49:55.389
And whoever refreshes others will himself be refreshed.

00:49:55.389 --> 00:50:00.909
May Jehovah make each one of you spiritually prosper.

00:50:00.909 --> 00:50:08.630
May he refresh you, as you refresh others, and generously using those expressions.

00:50:08.630 --> 00:50:30.800
Use them in your assignments wherever you go.

00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:38.719
We're very happy to report that here at Patterson, we had 3,609 in attendance.

00:50:38.719 --> 00:50:45.440
All our satellite locations combine the attendance 9,988.

00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:55.760
So that gives us a grand total attendance of 13,597 for this joyous occasion.

00:50:55.760 --> 00:51:02.760
Well, we've had a wonderful time, but now let's stand and sing a song.

00:51:02.760 --> 00:51:05.239
And then we'll thank Jehovah for this program.

00:51:05.239 --> 00:51:08.880
But we get to sing another one of the beautiful new songs we have.

00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:11.000
We are enjoying so much.

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:14.480
This one is song number 144.

00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:16.840
It means their life.

00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:22.559
And then after that song, Brother Patrick LaFranca, who serves as a helper to the personnel

00:51:22.559 --> 00:51:26.400
committee, will lead us in our closing prayer.

00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:31.119
So that song number 144, it means their life.
