00:00:41.009 --> 00:00:45.369
Before, we had the written watchtower, but I couldn't understand it.

00:00:45.369 --> 00:00:48.409
In the meeting, I couldn't really grasp everything either,

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:51.409
so I didn't feel confident to raise my hand in comment.

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:54.810
I tried to study the magazine, but I couldn't understand it,

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:57.090
and neither could the other deaf brothers.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.929
At the meetings, it was frustrating not being able to understand.

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:06.010
From the very beginning, we saw Jehovah's Hand in Matters.

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.409
In 1996, we went from being a small group to a congregation,

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.810
and then more groups were formed in different parts of the country,

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.810
and later even assemblies were interpreted in proven sign language.

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.209
However, we realized that our deaf brothers and sisters

00:01:22.209 --> 00:01:24.209
couldn't progress any further,

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:28.010
and this was because they didn't have an official translation

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.010
of the watchtower magazine in their own language.

00:01:33.209 --> 00:01:35.810
The deaf wanted to participate in the meetings,

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.010
but they always had to rely on us to understand the publications.

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.010
It was just so frustrating for them.

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.409
A lot of them didn't even want a copy of the publication

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:55.569
because they felt powerless to understand it.

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:57.769
For many years, the deaf brothers begged,

00:01:57.769 --> 00:01:59.769
please, we want the watchtower.

00:01:59.769 --> 00:02:02.170
We need to prepare in our own language.

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.969
We even received videos from different parts of the country

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:08.370
saying, ask the branch committee, the governing body,

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:11.169
we need the watchtower, please.

00:02:11.169 --> 00:02:12.770
When the letter arrived saying,

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.770
yes, you can translate the watchtower.

00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:16.770
We were jumping with joy.

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.169
We wanted to shout out loud and tell them,

00:02:19.169 --> 00:02:21.770
brothers, here is your watchtower.

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.370
But we had to control ourselves and wait

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.370
for the moment of the official announcement

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.370
when Jehovah would say, here's your gift, the watchtower.

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:55.740
When they made the announcement about the new watchtower

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.740
in sign language, the brothers were jumping out of their seats.

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:02.740
The whole place was just electric.

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:04.740
Everyone was cheering.

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.740
The watchtower in Peruvian sign language?

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:12.740
Wow, I was so happy I started to cry.

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:16.740
There are many benefits from having the watchtower in Peruvian sign.

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:18.740
The brothers can download it from the website

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:20.740
two months ahead of time and prepare without stress.

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:24.740
Another excellent benefit is now the elders who are deaf,

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:26.740
can study, understand the watchtower,

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:29.740
and prepare in order to conduct it at the meeting

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:32.740
because it's in their own language.

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:34.740
Now, not only can our deaf brothers and sisters

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.740
receive their own spiritual food directly

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:40.740
from the official translation of the watchtower magazine,

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.740
but even better, they receive the spiritual food

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:48.740
at the same time as any other language group in the world.

00:03:48.740 --> 00:04:03.900
When I view the watchtower,

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.900
I can understand everything.

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.900
My heart is overflowing with happiness.

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.900
I'm so thankful to Jehovah for this support.

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.899
What I'm learning now is helping me to progress spiritually.

00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:21.899
I am very happy that now I can deepen my friendship with Jehovah.

00:04:21.899 --> 00:04:24.899
Now that we have the watchtower in Peruvian sign language,

00:04:24.899 --> 00:04:28.899
I'm so excited and it touches my heart.

00:04:28.899 --> 00:04:30.899
It's the best feeling in the world

00:04:30.899 --> 00:04:35.899
that all my deaf brothers and sisters can understand just like I can.

00:04:35.899 --> 00:04:38.899
The spiritual light is progressively getting brighter

00:04:38.899 --> 00:04:40.899
and brighter for us.

00:04:40.899 --> 00:04:43.899
It's obvious that Jehovah's spirit is guiding the work.

00:04:43.899 --> 00:04:47.899
At last, this light is reaching our hearts.

00:04:47.899 --> 00:04:51.899
Now all the deaf and pruer benefitting from this blessing.

00:04:51.899 --> 00:04:56.899
We are so, so thankful to you, Jehovah.
