WEBVTT

00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:10.009
Well, in just a few minutes' time, we have a very special part of our program that has been prepared for us.

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:13.009
It's a special musical interlude.

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:20.010
If we could mention this year, although every year it's very important for us to sit respectfully and listen to it,

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:26.010
this year even more so because, as you realize, we have four new songs.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.010
And our musical interlude will include the four new songs.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:42.009
So believe me, it is very beneficial for all of us to sit respectfully and just absorb the music so that we're ready for the first song

00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:49.369
because we're going to start with the hardest one.

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:56.369
So the music program, as part of our program, will start in just a few seconds' time.

00:00:56.369 --> 00:10:52.389
Beautiful new kingdom songs for us to sing, and we look forward to hearing you sing those songs today.

00:10:52.389 --> 00:10:57.389
Well, we wish you warm welcome to all those here in our auditorium at Patterson,

00:10:57.389 --> 00:11:03.389
as well as all the various locations tied in here in the United States, as well as Canada,

00:11:03.389 --> 00:11:12.389
and also all our dear brothers and sisters around the world who will be watching this program on JW Broadcasting in a few days' time.

00:11:12.389 --> 00:11:15.389
We have a lot of good things to look forward to.

00:11:15.389 --> 00:11:19.389
But as a reminder, before we actually start with our song,

00:11:19.389 --> 00:11:24.389
you may realize on the back of your lapel card there's a special instruction,

00:11:24.389 --> 00:11:29.389
and we're not going to ask you to take it out, I'll read it to you.

00:11:29.389 --> 00:11:35.389
It says, as a reminder, it's requested that no flash cameras be used during the program.

00:11:35.389 --> 00:11:41.389
Any picture taken without flash must be taken from your seat location.

00:11:41.389 --> 00:11:45.389
No recordings of any kind of permitted.

00:11:45.389 --> 00:11:54.389
Cellular telephones, electronic tablets or similar devices should not be used to transmit any part of the program.

00:11:54.389 --> 00:11:59.389
Program notes with a hard copy or electronic should not be distributed to others.

00:11:59.389 --> 00:12:11.600
And of course it goes without saying that we want to make sure that any cellular phones or other devices are turned off so that they don't disturb others.

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:20.600
Well, we have an opportunity now to join together, to join our voices and singing one of the new songs.

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:27.600
It's song 142, the title of which is preaching to all sorts of people.

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:36.600
At the conclusion of the song, Brother Seth hired a helper to the service committee will offer the prayer, so song 142.

00:12:36.600 --> 00:15:30.850
Privilege, it is for us to be gathered here together with the students, soon to be graduates of the 138th Class of Gilead.

00:15:30.850 --> 00:15:39.850
We know you're probably very nervous, it's a very special day for you, we want you to relax and enjoy the graduation program.

00:15:39.850 --> 00:15:46.850
As you realize, you'll have talks given to you by members of the governing bodies, some helpers to governing body committees,

00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:53.850
and some of the instructors also have some final words that they would like to share with you.

00:15:53.850 --> 00:15:59.850
But at the start I have an opportunity to be able to talk to you a little bit about the future.

00:15:59.850 --> 00:16:07.850
See at this point, I'm sure you'll all agree with me, you've learnt so much, you've studied so much.

00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:12.850
Before you came to Gilead, you thought you knew about personal study, didn't you?

00:16:12.850 --> 00:16:19.850
Now you have a totally different viewpoint when it comes to what personal study involves.

00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:25.850
So now that you've gained all this instruction, what next?

00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:36.850
As you go to your assignment, whether it be returning back to where you came from or to a new assignment, what will you do with what you've learnt?

00:16:36.850 --> 00:16:48.850
Well the answer to that question, we could find in the words of the Apostle Paul, to Timothy, if you'd like to turn with me, to 2 Timothy chapter 2 and verse 2.

00:16:48.850 --> 00:17:00.850
And we could say this is the prayer of the governing body as well, that you will follow the instructions given here, 2 Timothy chapter 2, verse 2.

00:17:00.850 --> 00:17:15.849
And the things you heard from me that were supported by many witnesses, these things entrust to faithful men who in turn will be adequately qualified to teach others.

00:17:15.849 --> 00:17:25.849
Now whether your brothers or sisters, this information that you have is something that you can entrust to others.

00:17:25.849 --> 00:17:36.849
In Greek it basically means to set before others, but in English it's a very nice expression isn't it, to entrust to others.

00:17:36.849 --> 00:17:44.849
It denotes a measure of confidence or trust in the person that you're giving this information to.

00:17:44.849 --> 00:17:59.849
And in this way as you help others, strengthen others, perhaps many of whom cannot speak in English, so they would never have an opportunity to come here to Gilead, they can gain benefits from the beautiful experiences you've had.

00:17:59.849 --> 00:18:08.849
That of course is very opposite to the world, we now have people tend to not want to give out their experience to others.

00:18:08.849 --> 00:18:15.849
In fact in the Pacific we have an expression that literally means someone keeps the word to himself.

00:18:15.849 --> 00:18:25.849
And certainly none of us would want to be like that, to infer that we have some secret knowledge or special training that nobody else can gain.

00:18:25.849 --> 00:18:35.849
Because the truth of the matter is most of the material that you've discussed is from God's word, the Bible or from the publications that explain it.

00:18:35.849 --> 00:18:40.849
And of course most of those are available to the brothers in the various language groups.

00:18:40.849 --> 00:18:53.849
So with that in mind, for you to be able to entrust to others what you've learned, it requires that you have the correct viewpoint with regard to privileges.

00:18:53.849 --> 00:18:59.849
Now you could perhaps take the viewpoint, well now I've received this special training.

00:19:00.849 --> 00:19:07.849
I'm going back or going to a new assignment, now I am the one who should receive the privileges.

00:19:07.849 --> 00:19:13.849
I mean who else? I'm the one who's been trained.

00:19:13.849 --> 00:19:24.849
But rather than feel that way, how important it is for us to treasure privileges but not hoard them.

00:19:25.849 --> 00:19:33.849
You see, to treasure means to value, to hoard means to collect things that are valuable and hide them.

00:19:33.849 --> 00:19:42.849
So never hoard privileges, thinking that you're the only person on the surface of the earth who qualifies to have the privilege.

00:19:42.849 --> 00:19:50.849
But be willing to train others, not afraid of the fact that perhaps later they will get some of your privileges.

00:19:51.849 --> 00:19:59.849
And let's face it, maybe they'll do even a better job of caring for those privileges if you train them correctly.

00:19:59.849 --> 00:20:04.849
Now with that in mind, I thought we might think of the example of the Prophet Moses.

00:20:04.849 --> 00:20:08.849
Moses had many wonderful privileges.

00:20:08.849 --> 00:20:14.849
But perhaps we could just think of one example involving the tent of meeting.

00:20:15.849 --> 00:20:18.849
Now which tent of meeting are we talking about?

00:20:18.849 --> 00:20:21.849
Well you might be thinking, oh it's the sanctuary.

00:20:21.849 --> 00:20:23.849
No.

00:20:23.849 --> 00:20:27.849
And inside volume it explains there were actually two tents of meeting.

00:20:27.849 --> 00:20:32.849
Turn with me please to the book of Exodus chapter 33.

00:20:32.849 --> 00:20:40.849
And here it describes what happened when Moses came down from Mount Sinai and what he did at that point.

00:20:40.849 --> 00:20:44.849
Exodus 33 and verse 7.

00:20:44.849 --> 00:20:59.849
Now Moses took notice his tent, so Moses' personal tent, and pitched it outside the camp at some distance from the camp.

00:20:59.849 --> 00:21:02.849
And he called it a tent of meeting.

00:21:02.849 --> 00:21:09.849
Everyone inquiring of Jehovah would go out to the tent of meeting which was outside the camp.

00:21:09.849 --> 00:21:15.849
Now by contrast you remember the sanctuary was placed right in the middle of the camp.

00:21:15.849 --> 00:21:18.849
But here Moses had a special privilege.

00:21:18.849 --> 00:21:26.849
His personal tent was set up outside the camp and that became a tent of meeting.

00:21:26.849 --> 00:21:29.849
Now what sort of privileges were associated with this?

00:21:29.849 --> 00:21:32.849
Just imagine if it was your tent.

00:21:32.849 --> 00:21:35.849
Well let's read on verses 8-11.

00:21:35.849 --> 00:21:44.849
As soon as Moses went out to the tent all the people would rise and stand at the entrance of their own tents.

00:21:44.849 --> 00:21:48.849
And they would gaze after Moses until he entered into the tent.

00:21:48.849 --> 00:21:50.849
Can you visualize that?

00:21:50.849 --> 00:21:52.849
Here's this tent outside the camp.

00:21:52.849 --> 00:21:54.849
Moses goes to it.

00:21:54.849 --> 00:21:59.849
Everyone goes out of the tents and gazes at Moses.

00:21:59.849 --> 00:22:10.849
Verse 9, as soon as Moses would go into the tent the pillar of cloud would come down and stand at the entrance of the tent while God spoke with Moses.

00:22:10.849 --> 00:22:13.849
Do you see a privilege here?

00:22:13.849 --> 00:22:15.849
The cloud, the pillar of cloud.

00:22:15.849 --> 00:22:18.849
Just above whose tent?

00:22:18.849 --> 00:22:20.849
Moses' tent.

00:22:20.849 --> 00:22:21.849
We read on.

00:22:21.849 --> 00:22:30.849
When all the people saw the pillar of cloud standing at the entrance of the tent each of them rose and bowed down at the entrance of his own tent.

00:22:30.849 --> 00:22:36.849
Jehovah spoke to Moses face to face just as one man would speak to another man.

00:22:36.849 --> 00:22:41.849
What a wonderful privilege Moses had.

00:22:41.849 --> 00:22:51.849
In the few months before the tabernacle was built his tent became, you might say, the center of worship.

00:22:51.849 --> 00:22:57.849
All eyes were upon Moses and his tent.

00:22:57.849 --> 00:23:04.849
Can you imagine that pillar of cloud there hovering over the entrance of his tent?

00:23:04.849 --> 00:23:06.849
But then what happened?

00:23:06.849 --> 00:23:12.849
Well as time went on Jehovah told Moses about the building of the tabernacle.

00:23:12.849 --> 00:23:17.849
The tabernacle was completed and then what happened?

00:23:17.849 --> 00:23:34.259
Well let's turn across to Exodus 40 and verses 34 and 35.

00:23:34.259 --> 00:23:37.259
And the cloud began to cover the tent of meeting.

00:23:37.259 --> 00:23:40.259
Now this is the tabernacle, not Moses' tent.

00:23:40.259 --> 00:23:44.259
And Jehovah's glory filled the tabernacle.

00:23:44.259 --> 00:23:50.259
Moses was not able to go into the tent of meeting because the cloud remained over it.

00:23:50.259 --> 00:23:54.259
And Jehovah's glory filled the tabernacle.

00:23:54.259 --> 00:23:57.259
So what had happened?

00:23:57.259 --> 00:24:06.259
Well instead of having the privilege of the pillar of cloud there above his own personal tent,

00:24:06.259 --> 00:24:11.259
now that shifted right to the center of the camp.

00:24:11.259 --> 00:24:17.259
No longer were all eyes turned to Moses and his place of resonance.

00:24:17.259 --> 00:24:24.259
Not only that, we noticed at this point he wasn't even allowed to go into the inner part of the tabernacle.

00:24:24.259 --> 00:24:29.259
Because there's a question as to whether he was ever allowed later to go in again.

00:24:29.259 --> 00:24:37.259
One option has been mentioned that perhaps he went into the holy and stood before the curtain and spoke to Jehovah.

00:24:37.259 --> 00:24:41.259
But we can't be dogmatic about what happened.

00:24:41.259 --> 00:24:49.259
One thing we do know though is that Aaron was then installed as a high priest along with his sons as priests.

00:24:49.259 --> 00:24:51.259
So what happened?

00:24:51.259 --> 00:24:55.259
Basically Moses lost a privilege.

00:24:55.259 --> 00:25:01.259
It was transferred over to Aaron to represent the Israelites in worship.

00:25:01.259 --> 00:25:04.259
And Moses' tent, what happened to it?

00:25:04.259 --> 00:25:08.259
Well, it no longer had a pillar of cloud over it.

00:25:08.259 --> 00:25:18.259
But the lesson is, do we hear of Moses complaining and saying things were a lot better when they used my tent?

00:25:18.259 --> 00:25:26.259
Did he complain about the fact that now he was no longer the center of worship than everyone was looking to him?

00:25:26.259 --> 00:25:29.259
No, we have no indication of that at all.

00:25:29.259 --> 00:25:39.259
Why? Because Moses was happy to work with Jehovah's arrangement to see his brother get extra privileges and to see an arrangement set in place.

00:25:39.259 --> 00:25:42.259
Do we see the lesson for us today?

00:25:42.259 --> 00:25:47.259
You see, Jehovah's arrangement is for us to train others.

00:25:47.259 --> 00:25:51.259
And as we train them, they become qualified.

00:25:51.259 --> 00:25:54.259
And perhaps then they can train others.

00:25:54.259 --> 00:25:59.259
We should never, ever, ever hoard those privileges.

00:25:59.259 --> 00:26:07.259
And think, I can't train this person too much, otherwise they may take over the privilege that I have.

00:26:07.259 --> 00:26:13.259
Treasure whatever privilege you have, but never hoard privileges.

00:26:13.259 --> 00:26:21.259
Yes, be sure to entrust to faithful persons the beautiful things that you've learned here at Gilead.

00:26:21.259 --> 00:26:24.259
Well, we have many good things to share with you.

00:26:24.259 --> 00:26:26.259
And we've just started our program.

00:26:26.259 --> 00:26:30.259
The next brother in our program is Brother Kenneth Flodin.

00:26:30.259 --> 00:26:32.259
He's a helper to the teaching committee.

00:26:32.259 --> 00:26:40.259
And Brother Flodin is going to ask you the question, will you be frightened by the sound of a leaf?

00:26:57.640 --> 00:27:08.640
As you know, the focus of Gilead is to train students so that they will be able to strengthen and stabilize God's people.

00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:15.640
Well, that's quite a responsibility for you to carry with you to your respective assignments.

00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:24.640
And in the future, you will face some circumstances that might be intimidating, even frightening.

00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:28.640
Please find the book of Leviticus 26.

00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:31.640
Leviticus 26.

00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:35.640
And most of this book is legislative writing.

00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:42.640
But the all scripture book says of chapter 26, the book of Leviticus reaches its climax in this chapter.

00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:48.640
Jehovah here lists the rewards for obedience and the punishments for disobedience.

00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:53.640
Now look at Leviticus 26, verse 3.

00:27:53.640 --> 00:28:03.640
It says, if you continue walking in my statutes and keeping my commandments and carrying them out, I will give you showers of rain at their proper time.

00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:10.640
And then at this blessing, after blessing that would come to them, if they kept Jehovah's commandments.

00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:19.640
If they did what was expected of them, no matter how intimidating or threatening circumstance might seem to be.

00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:24.109
Well, what about you students of Gillian?

00:28:24.109 --> 00:28:28.109
For five months, you've considered the commandments of Jehovah.

00:28:28.109 --> 00:28:38.109
But you will you fully carry out what is expected of you, no matter how intimidating or frightening circumstances might seem.

00:28:38.109 --> 00:28:42.109
Well, what if the Israelites shirk the responsibility?

00:28:42.109 --> 00:28:45.109
They did not live up to Jehovah's expectations.

00:28:45.109 --> 00:28:51.109
Well, in verses 15 to 34, it describes the calamities that would befall them.

00:28:51.109 --> 00:28:58.160
One thing slaughtered by their enemies, desolating of Jerusalem.

00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:03.160
But then it does say that some would survive that calamity.

00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:07.599
But how did Jehovah describe them?

00:29:07.599 --> 00:29:12.599
Read now with me, Leviticus 26, 36.

00:29:12.599 --> 00:29:20.680
As for those who survive, I will fill their hearts with despair in the lands of their enemies.

00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:27.680
And the sound of a blowing leaf will cause them to flee.

00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:33.680
And they will flee like someone running from the sword and fall without anyone pursuing them.

00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:41.680
Scared of their own shadow, what a ludicrous word picture running scared from a dried-up leaf.

00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:49.680
Well, when you students get to your assignments, no matter what challenges you face, will you be intimidated?

00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:51.680
Will you be frightful?

00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:53.680
Face them.

00:29:53.680 --> 00:30:01.660
With Jehovah's help, just you them as a mere shriveled-up leaf.

00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:12.660
Well, since your primary role is to strengthen and stabilize God's people, then you students should not be content to be merely a faithful missionary.

00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:15.660
Or a faithful Bethelite.

00:30:15.660 --> 00:30:18.660
What did Paul expect of Timothy?

00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:32.660
He expected him to take the lead in the congregations, spearhead the work, to wrestle down thorny issues to set matter straight, not just placidly faithful.

00:30:33.660 --> 00:30:40.660
In fact, in 1 Timothy 412, Timothy was told, become an example to the faithful ones.

00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:51.140
You, soon to be graduates, you're to become an example to the faithful ones in your branch territory.

00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:56.450
But what if the Israelites shirk the responsibility?

00:30:56.450 --> 00:30:59.450
They didn't live up to Jehovah's standards.

00:30:59.450 --> 00:31:04.450
Well, exactly what we said, they would have calamity.

00:31:05.450 --> 00:31:08.450
Live up to which Jehovah expects of you.

00:31:08.450 --> 00:31:12.450
Well, what are some of these circumstances that might be intimidating or frightening?

00:31:12.450 --> 00:31:19.450
In Matthew 10, Jesus said, you will be brought before governors and kings for my sake.

00:31:19.450 --> 00:31:22.450
Then He said, don't be anxious.

00:31:22.450 --> 00:31:25.450
Do not be frightened at the sound of a leaf.

00:31:25.450 --> 00:31:32.700
So yes, some of you will actually deal with government officials for the sake of the good news.

00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:38.700
This stability of a government is another real factor in some of the countries to which you will go.

00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:48.700
And Satan uses the wind of nationalism to blow a leaf, to foment opposition because of our neutral stand.

00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:58.700
Will you, brothers and sisters, be an example to the faithful ones, not frightened by the sound of a leaf?

00:31:58.700 --> 00:32:04.700
The missionary couple was assigned to a densely populated city.

00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:09.700
And they became so fearful of being mugged that it affected their ministry.

00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:12.700
They talked about leaving their assignment.

00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:19.700
But now some years later, still there, they look back and they feel sheepish, embarrassed at the way they acted.

00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:24.700
You see, momentarily, scared by a leaf.

00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:35.700
Another situation that you may face is sometimes lies are promoted by false religion, picked up on by the news media and spread.

00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:38.700
Well, this can rattle some of our fellow witnesses.

00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:42.700
They feel intimidated. They don't want to go out in the ministry, face that music.

00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:48.700
Take an uncowering stand in the face of lies.

00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:53.700
God's organization is depending on you to be an example to the faithful ones.

00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:58.700
Or it is after occurs the branch committee might assign you to organize the relief work.

00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:06.700
Or to shepherd those who suffered loss of home or family members' lives have been lost.

00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:13.700
Intimidating face it, view it as the sound of a rustling leaf.

00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:17.700
Well, how about this one? Some of you might become a member of the branch committee.

00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:22.700
You say, oh, that seems like such a daunting responsibility.

00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:33.680
It is. But with Jehovah's help, your anxiety will shrivel and be gone with the wind.

00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:38.680
Well, now it's for a moment. Think of the personality of the Apostle Paul.

00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:43.680
His life was like late autumn in a windstorm.

00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:53.680
Leaves swirled around him. But not intimidated, he became a tower of strength, stabilizing all the brothers.

00:33:53.680 --> 00:34:00.680
Become Paul to those in your branch territory, even as he imitated the Christ.

00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:05.680
Please now turn with me to 1 Corinthians, excuse me, 2 Corinthians chapter 1.

00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:14.960
Let's look at an example of a frightening situation that Paul faced and how he gave all credit to Jehovah and the prayers of others.

00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:17.960
2 Corinthians 1 starting in verse 8.

00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:26.070
It says, for we do not want you to be unaware brothers of the tribulation we experience in the province of Asia.

00:34:27.070 --> 00:34:34.070
We were under extreme pressure beyond our own strength so that we were very uncertain even of our lives.

00:34:34.070 --> 00:34:39.070
In fact, we felt that we had received the sentence of death.

00:34:39.070 --> 00:34:45.070
This was so that we would trust not in ourselves, but in the God who raises up the dead.

00:34:45.070 --> 00:34:49.070
Paul thought the only way out of this situation would be my resurrection.

00:34:50.070 --> 00:34:51.070
Verse 10.

00:34:51.070 --> 00:34:55.070
From such great risk of death he did rescue us and will rescue us.

00:34:55.070 --> 00:34:59.070
And our hope is in him that he will also continue to rescue us.

00:34:59.070 --> 00:35:03.070
You also can help us by your supplications for us.

00:35:03.070 --> 00:35:06.070
What were the circumstances that were so dreadful?

00:35:06.070 --> 00:35:09.070
Turn to Acts chapter 19.

00:35:09.070 --> 00:35:13.070
Some Bible scholars feel it was the riot and emphasis.

00:35:13.070 --> 00:35:18.070
Now you recall those who were making shrines for the goddess Artemis.

00:35:18.070 --> 00:35:23.070
They thought that they were going to lose their business because of the preaching of Paul and his companions.

00:35:23.070 --> 00:35:27.070
So pick it up with me in Acts 19, 29 and 30.

00:35:27.070 --> 00:35:33.739
It says, so the city became filled with confusion and altogether they rushed into the theater,

00:35:33.739 --> 00:35:39.739
dragging along with them gays and areas of Tarkas, Macedonians, traveling companions of Paul.

00:35:39.739 --> 00:35:43.739
What was Paul intimidated by this mob?

00:35:44.739 --> 00:35:45.739
Verse 30.

00:35:45.739 --> 00:35:49.739
For his part, Paul was willing to go inside to the people.

00:35:49.739 --> 00:35:52.739
But the disciples would not permit him.

00:35:52.739 --> 00:35:56.739
Well then verse 34 says that for two solid hours they shouted,

00:35:56.739 --> 00:36:03.739
great is Artemis, the goddess of Ephesus, great is Artemis, the goddess of Ephesus, two hours.

00:36:03.739 --> 00:36:06.739
What an intimidating circumstance.

00:36:06.739 --> 00:36:11.739
But Paul handled it like a leaf in the wind.

00:36:11.739 --> 00:36:14.739
But you remember in 2 Corinthians 1 it said,

00:36:14.739 --> 00:36:18.739
we felt that we had received the sentence of death.

00:36:18.739 --> 00:36:24.739
So there's another possibility that might be more in keeping with the gravity of Paul's words.

00:36:24.739 --> 00:36:27.739
And this has to do when Paul was defending the resurrection.

00:36:27.739 --> 00:36:30.739
1 Corinthians 1532.

00:36:30.739 --> 00:36:33.739
You remember he said, if like other men,

00:36:33.739 --> 00:36:41.739
I have fought wild beasts in Ephesus of what good is it to me.

00:36:41.739 --> 00:36:47.739
So it may be that Paul actually faced wild beasts in the stadium in Ephesus,

00:36:47.739 --> 00:36:49.739
terrifying indeed.

00:36:49.739 --> 00:36:55.739
If so, he gave all credit to Jehovah for his rescue.

00:36:55.739 --> 00:36:59.739
We certainly hope you won't be facing wild beasts anytime soon.

00:36:59.739 --> 00:37:04.739
But the point is that after that harrowing experience was put in the past,

00:37:04.739 --> 00:37:10.239
Paul viewed it as a sound of a leaf.

00:37:10.239 --> 00:37:11.239
He moved on.

00:37:11.239 --> 00:37:15.239
He gave all credit to Jehovah and the prayers of others.

00:37:15.239 --> 00:37:18.239
And actually when we face and go through a harrowing,

00:37:18.239 --> 00:37:20.239
maybe an intimidating circumstance,

00:37:20.239 --> 00:37:24.239
it actually gives us more and more confidence in Jehovah for future events.

00:37:24.239 --> 00:37:26.239
And as that would Paul said, remember he said,

00:37:26.239 --> 00:37:30.239
from such a great risk of death he did rescue me.

00:37:30.239 --> 00:37:33.239
But then with full confidence he said, and will rescue me.

00:37:33.239 --> 00:37:39.840
And our hope is in him that he will also continue to rescue us.

00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:43.840
Well, we will make supplication that Jehovah continue with you,

00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:46.840
the 138th class of Gilead.

00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:50.840
And no matter what you face in your future assignments,

00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:54.840
become an example to the faithful ones.

00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:56.840
And do not.

00:37:56.840 --> 00:38:00.840
Do not be frightened by the sound of a leaf.

00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:18.230
I'm sure we all appreciated those very interesting descriptions for us.

00:38:18.230 --> 00:38:23.230
Well, the next part of our program involves a talk by a member of the governing body,

00:38:23.230 --> 00:38:25.230
Brother Mark Sanderson.

00:38:25.230 --> 00:38:28.230
And he has an intriguing title for his talk.

00:38:28.230 --> 00:38:31.230
What are you looking for?

00:38:31.230 --> 00:38:35.539
What are you looking for?

00:38:35.539 --> 00:38:38.539
This is a very important question,

00:38:38.539 --> 00:38:42.539
because what you're looking for will greatly affect

00:38:42.539 --> 00:38:44.539
what you will find.

00:38:44.539 --> 00:38:50.539
A fundamental truth is stated in the Bible at Proverbs chapter 13 and verse 12.

00:38:50.539 --> 00:38:52.539
It says there,

00:38:52.539 --> 00:38:57.539
expectation postponed is making the heart sick.

00:38:57.539 --> 00:39:01.539
Well, that's how some people go through their whole life,

00:39:01.539 --> 00:39:07.539
really feeling heart sick, feeling disappointed and why.

00:39:07.539 --> 00:39:10.539
Well, people often look for things,

00:39:10.539 --> 00:39:12.539
they're focused on goals,

00:39:12.539 --> 00:39:15.539
and try to achieve them that are very unrealistic,

00:39:15.539 --> 00:39:19.539
or that are not truly worthwhile.

00:39:19.539 --> 00:39:24.539
The Pew Center for Research asked a group of 18 to 25-year-olds

00:39:24.539 --> 00:39:29.539
what was the most important goal of their generation?

00:39:29.539 --> 00:39:33.539
More than 80% said getting rich.

00:39:33.539 --> 00:39:37.539
The second answer was getting famous.

00:39:37.539 --> 00:39:41.539
Well, most of those people were looking for something

00:39:41.539 --> 00:39:43.539
that they would never find.

00:39:43.539 --> 00:39:47.539
They were going to end up disappointed.

00:39:47.539 --> 00:39:51.539
So, what are you looking for?

00:39:51.539 --> 00:39:54.539
Now, it's interesting that in essence this is the question

00:39:54.539 --> 00:40:01.539
that Jesus posed to the crowds concerning John the baptizer in Luke chapter 7.

00:40:02.539 --> 00:40:06.539
Now, here in Luke chapter 7 and verse 24,

00:40:06.539 --> 00:40:08.539
you'll see about midway down through the verse,

00:40:08.539 --> 00:40:10.539
Jesus posed this question.

00:40:10.539 --> 00:40:11.539
He said,

00:40:11.539 --> 00:40:14.539
what did you go out into the wilderness to see?

00:40:14.539 --> 00:40:18.539
A read being tossed by the wind?

00:40:18.539 --> 00:40:21.539
Well, now one reference work regarding this verse says

00:40:21.539 --> 00:40:25.539
that the region of the country in which John preached

00:40:25.539 --> 00:40:29.539
produced great quantities of reads or canes

00:40:29.539 --> 00:40:34.539
of a light fragile nature that were easily shaken by the wind.

00:40:34.539 --> 00:40:41.539
This, therefore, became an image of a light changing in constant man.

00:40:41.539 --> 00:40:44.539
Well, some people love that, don't they?

00:40:44.539 --> 00:40:47.539
They love a circular reasoning that just goes around and around,

00:40:47.539 --> 00:40:50.539
never comes to any solid conclusion.

00:40:50.539 --> 00:40:53.539
Now, if that's what the people were looking for,

00:40:53.539 --> 00:40:55.539
when they went out to see John,

00:40:55.539 --> 00:40:58.539
some wishy-washy philosopher,

00:40:58.539 --> 00:41:01.539
they were going to be very much disappointed.

00:41:01.539 --> 00:41:03.539
John was nothing like that.

00:41:03.539 --> 00:41:07.539
He was a strong man with a solid message.

00:41:07.539 --> 00:41:10.539
He was not a read blowing in the wind.

00:41:10.539 --> 00:41:11.539
He was firm.

00:41:11.539 --> 00:41:12.539
He was stable.

00:41:12.539 --> 00:41:14.539
He was upright.

00:41:14.539 --> 00:41:17.539
Well, then what did Jesus ask next?

00:41:17.539 --> 00:41:20.539
Luke chapter 7, verse 25.

00:41:20.539 --> 00:41:24.539
He says, what then did you go out to see?

00:41:24.539 --> 00:41:27.539
A man dressed in soft garments?

00:41:27.539 --> 00:41:33.539
Why those wearing splendid dress and living in luxury are in royal houses?

00:41:33.539 --> 00:41:35.539
Well, that's what some people like, isn't it?

00:41:35.539 --> 00:41:40.539
They want to see someone who has a very, very impressive appearance.

00:41:40.539 --> 00:41:43.539
Well, if the Jews who went out to see John

00:41:43.539 --> 00:41:47.539
were looking for a man that would be in a luxurious palace,

00:41:47.539 --> 00:41:51.539
wearing splendid dress, well, again,

00:41:51.539 --> 00:41:53.539
they were going to be very disappointed.

00:41:53.539 --> 00:41:55.539
You remember John's garment?

00:41:55.539 --> 00:41:57.539
What was it made of?

00:41:57.539 --> 00:41:58.539
Camels hair.

00:41:58.539 --> 00:42:02.539
In fact, one reference work says,

00:42:02.539 --> 00:42:04.539
it was a rough, harsh,

00:42:04.539 --> 00:42:08.539
the very cheapest kind of material.

00:42:08.539 --> 00:42:10.539
And what was John eating?

00:42:10.539 --> 00:42:15.539
Well, his diet was locusts and wild honey,

00:42:15.539 --> 00:42:18.539
hardly a palace.

00:42:18.539 --> 00:42:22.539
Well, then what did Jesus say next in verse 26?

00:42:23.539 --> 00:42:27.539
Really, then, what did you go out to see?

00:42:27.539 --> 00:42:29.539
A prophet?

00:42:29.539 --> 00:42:34.539
Yes, I tell you, and far more than a prophet.

00:42:34.539 --> 00:42:37.539
Well, those who went out to see a prophet,

00:42:37.539 --> 00:42:41.539
they were not going to be disappointed.

00:42:41.539 --> 00:42:46.539
In fact, John was even more than what such ones were expecting.

00:42:46.539 --> 00:42:49.539
He was the forerunner of the Messiah,

00:42:49.539 --> 00:42:52.539
the one who would teach people Jehovah's ways

00:42:52.539 --> 00:42:55.539
and introduce them to the Lamb of God

00:42:55.539 --> 00:42:58.539
who would take away the sins of the world.

00:42:58.539 --> 00:43:01.539
Honest-hearted people who were looking for the Messiah

00:43:01.539 --> 00:43:04.539
and who wanted to do the will of Jehovah

00:43:04.539 --> 00:43:07.539
would not be disappointed by this experience.

00:43:07.539 --> 00:43:11.539
This is exactly what they were looking for.

00:43:11.539 --> 00:43:16.539
Well, now, brothers, what's the lesson here for us?

00:43:16.539 --> 00:43:20.539
As Gilead students, you're about to graduate today.

00:43:20.539 --> 00:43:23.539
You're about to go on to your assignments.

00:43:23.539 --> 00:43:25.539
What are you looking for?

00:43:25.539 --> 00:43:28.539
And what are you going to see?

00:43:28.539 --> 00:43:30.539
Well, no doubt when you came,

00:43:30.539 --> 00:43:34.539
you had certain expectations about what Gilead would be like.

00:43:34.539 --> 00:43:36.539
What your training would be like.

00:43:36.539 --> 00:43:40.539
And even about what your assignments would be.

00:43:40.539 --> 00:43:44.539
What if you were expecting that Gilead would bring you

00:43:44.539 --> 00:43:47.539
a certain measure of prominence,

00:43:47.539 --> 00:43:50.539
or even a certain measure of prestige?

00:43:50.539 --> 00:43:55.539
Well, no doubt you're going to be greatly disappointed.

00:43:55.539 --> 00:43:57.539
And why do we say that?

00:43:57.539 --> 00:44:02.539
Well, let's look at what Jesus said here at Luke chapter 12

00:44:02.539 --> 00:44:09.260
and verse 48.

00:44:09.260 --> 00:44:14.139
Luke chapter 12 and verse 48.

00:44:14.139 --> 00:44:16.139
Jesus said,

00:44:17.139 --> 00:44:20.139
Indeed, looking at about the middle of the verse,

00:44:20.139 --> 00:44:24.139
indeed, everyone to whom much was given,

00:44:24.139 --> 00:44:27.139
much will be demanded of him.

00:44:27.139 --> 00:44:30.139
And the one who was put in charge of much

00:44:30.139 --> 00:44:34.139
will have more than usual demanded of him.

00:44:34.139 --> 00:44:37.139
Well, that's really the reality of it.

00:44:37.139 --> 00:44:40.139
Instead of gaining more prestige or prominence,

00:44:40.139 --> 00:44:43.139
from now on, you may find that people are going to expect

00:44:43.139 --> 00:44:45.139
even more of you.

00:44:45.139 --> 00:44:47.139
They're going to watch your example.

00:44:47.139 --> 00:44:49.139
They're going to listen to the talks that you give.

00:44:49.139 --> 00:44:53.139
They're going to look at what you accomplish in the ministry.

00:44:53.139 --> 00:44:56.139
And you know, brothers, what we would like is for them to look at you

00:44:56.139 --> 00:44:58.139
and say,

00:44:58.139 --> 00:45:03.139
Oh, that brother or that sister went through Gilead.

00:45:03.139 --> 00:45:07.139
And not that brother went through Gilead.

00:45:07.139 --> 00:45:16.139
We want your training to be a blessing to you and to the brothers

00:45:16.139 --> 00:45:18.139
and sisters in the field.

00:45:18.139 --> 00:45:22.139
And I have to say the governing body has truly been delighted

00:45:22.139 --> 00:45:26.139
with the level of maturity and experience of the students

00:45:26.139 --> 00:45:29.139
who've been coming to Gilead and of the wonderful work

00:45:29.139 --> 00:45:32.139
that all of you have been accomplishing or has been accomplished

00:45:32.139 --> 00:45:36.139
and we know you're going to accomplish when you get to your assignments.

00:45:37.139 --> 00:45:41.139
Well, what if you were expecting an enlarged assignment?

00:45:41.139 --> 00:45:45.139
It could happen some of you may get an enlarged assignment.

00:45:45.139 --> 00:45:50.139
But the reality is most of you are going to return to the assignment

00:45:50.139 --> 00:45:52.139
that you had before.

00:45:52.139 --> 00:45:56.139
However, what if when you came to hear to Gilead,

00:45:56.139 --> 00:46:02.139
you were expecting to use your training to help honest-hearted people

00:46:02.139 --> 00:46:08.139
to grow spiritually, to help them to learn the things that you are taught,

00:46:08.139 --> 00:46:13.139
to love them and to support them so that they can endure the trials

00:46:13.139 --> 00:46:18.139
that they're facing right now and the trials that they're going to have to face in the future,

00:46:18.139 --> 00:46:24.139
to assist them, to strengthen their faith just as you have had your faith

00:46:24.139 --> 00:46:27.139
strengthen here during the program.

00:46:27.139 --> 00:46:30.139
Well, if that's what you were looking for,

00:46:30.139 --> 00:46:35.139
if that's what you were expecting, you will not be disappointed.

00:46:35.139 --> 00:46:41.139
You're going to find a bumper crop of honest-hearted people who need your love,

00:46:41.139 --> 00:46:46.139
who need your faith, who need your friendship.

00:46:46.139 --> 00:46:51.139
And as you work hard to help them, you're going to fulfill the real purpose

00:46:51.139 --> 00:46:59.139
of your coming to Gilead to strengthen and to stabilize the field and branch organization.

00:47:00.139 --> 00:47:07.139
So remember, what you are looking for will greatly affect what you're going to find.

00:47:07.139 --> 00:47:11.139
Ask yourself, what am I really looking for?

00:47:11.139 --> 00:47:15.139
Look to be the humble servant of your brothers and sisters

00:47:15.139 --> 00:47:20.139
and do the very best you can to accomplish the will of Jehovah.

00:47:20.139 --> 00:47:25.139
And then you will never be disappointed with what you find.

00:47:25.139 --> 00:47:41.219
Thank you so much, Brother Sanderson, for that very interesting talk.

00:47:41.219 --> 00:47:45.219
And now we all know what we should be looking for.

00:47:45.219 --> 00:47:48.219
Well, next on our program, you're going to hear from one of our instructors

00:47:48.219 --> 00:47:51.219
from the Theocratic Schools Department.

00:47:51.219 --> 00:47:59.900
And Brother James Cuthan is going to talk to us on the theme, Feed the Hungry.

00:47:59.900 --> 00:48:06.900
It has been said that there's more hunger for love and appreciation in this world

00:48:06.900 --> 00:48:09.900
than there is for bread.

00:48:09.900 --> 00:48:13.900
I'm sure every one of us can think of a time when a dear brother or dear sister

00:48:13.900 --> 00:48:18.900
said just the right words of encouragement or commendation to us.

00:48:18.900 --> 00:48:24.900
And we felt so uplifted, why it was if our spirit soared.

00:48:24.900 --> 00:48:28.900
Why? Why does it have that effect on us?

00:48:28.900 --> 00:48:35.900
It has that effect because every human needs to feel love, recognition,

00:48:35.900 --> 00:48:38.900
and appreciation.

00:48:38.900 --> 00:48:44.900
Everyone, everyone that lives now, everyone that ever lived needs to feel it.

00:48:44.900 --> 00:48:47.900
And that included the perfect man Jesus.

00:48:47.900 --> 00:48:56.900
Open your Bibles, please, to this special occasion that is recorded for us in Matthew chapter 3.

00:48:56.900 --> 00:49:01.900
And you will recognize this as the events surrounding Jesus' baptism.

00:49:01.900 --> 00:49:07.900
Jesus now would embark upon a three and a half year ministry.

00:49:07.900 --> 00:49:11.900
And it would be a very special time, but a crucial time in his life.

00:49:11.900 --> 00:49:13.900
He would face opposition.

00:49:13.900 --> 00:49:17.900
He would face persecution. He would face temptation from the devil.

00:49:17.900 --> 00:49:22.340
And it would end in a magnetizing death.

00:49:22.340 --> 00:49:25.340
He knew that. And so did Jehovah.

00:49:25.340 --> 00:49:28.340
What did Jehovah do for his son?

00:49:28.340 --> 00:49:32.340
Read along with me verses 16 and 17.

00:49:32.340 --> 00:49:35.340
Matthew chapter 3.

00:49:35.340 --> 00:49:41.340
It says, after being baptized, Jesus immediately came up from the water and look.

00:49:41.340 --> 00:49:43.340
The heavens were opened up.

00:49:43.340 --> 00:49:47.340
And he saw God's spirit descending like a dove and coming upon him.

00:49:47.340 --> 00:49:50.340
Look, also a voice from the heavens said,

00:49:50.340 --> 00:49:57.340
This is my son, the beloved, whom I have approved.

00:49:57.340 --> 00:50:00.340
What do you think that meant to Jesus?

00:50:00.340 --> 00:50:06.340
To have the heavens opened up and his perfect mind now recalls his pre-human existence.

00:50:06.340 --> 00:50:12.340
And then, then for the first time of only three times,

00:50:12.340 --> 00:50:15.340
God's own voice is heard by a human.

00:50:15.340 --> 00:50:17.340
And what does he say?

00:50:17.340 --> 00:50:22.340
He says, This is my son, the beloved.

00:50:22.340 --> 00:50:26.550
I have approved.

00:50:26.550 --> 00:50:28.550
What did that mean to Jesus?

00:50:28.550 --> 00:50:32.550
Knowing that Jesus had his father's love and approval,

00:50:32.550 --> 00:50:39.550
he could face opposition and criticism with courage and with confidence.

00:50:39.550 --> 00:50:42.550
And knowing that he had his father's love and approval,

00:50:42.550 --> 00:50:48.550
he could maintain balance and emotional stability even in the face of death.

00:50:48.550 --> 00:50:52.550
You see, all of us are strengthened by kind words of commendation.

00:50:52.550 --> 00:50:57.550
In fact, this graduation program itself is an opportunity for governing body members,

00:50:57.550 --> 00:51:06.550
and their helpers, and your instructors to offer you students a sincere, well done.

00:51:06.550 --> 00:51:13.550
Of course, there would be no greater blessing than to know that we have Jehovah's approval.

00:51:13.550 --> 00:51:17.550
And Jehovah wants us to know that we do.

00:51:17.550 --> 00:51:22.550
We know he does because of what he inspired David to write.

00:51:22.550 --> 00:51:30.550
These very encouraging words found in Psalm, the fifth Psalm, actually.

00:51:30.550 --> 00:51:38.960
Chapter 5 and verse 12.

00:51:38.960 --> 00:51:42.960
He writes, For you will bless anyone righteous, so Jehovah,

00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:48.960
you will surround them with approval as with a large shield.

00:51:48.960 --> 00:51:51.960
A large shield. A large shield of approval.

00:51:51.960 --> 00:51:54.960
A large shield would cover the whole person.

00:51:54.960 --> 00:51:57.960
A large shield would protect the whole body.

00:51:57.960 --> 00:51:59.960
And that's what we need.

00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:04.960
We need a large shield to protect us from all of Satan's burning missiles.

00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:07.960
But how does Jehovah provide that?

00:52:07.960 --> 00:52:14.960
He provides it through his word, of course, through his organization, through his Holy Spirit.

00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:18.960
But there's also another very important way.

00:52:18.960 --> 00:52:24.960
And that is encapsulated in a Bible principle that's found in Proverbs chapter 3.

00:52:24.960 --> 00:52:30.780
You can read it in verse 27.

00:52:30.780 --> 00:52:38.380
Proverbs 3, 27 says, Do not withhold good from those to whom you should give it,

00:52:38.380 --> 00:52:42.380
if it is within your power to help.

00:52:42.380 --> 00:52:44.380
It's within your power.

00:52:44.380 --> 00:52:48.380
Jehovah has given the ability to do good to others to you.

00:52:48.380 --> 00:52:51.380
It's in your hand.

00:52:51.380 --> 00:52:54.380
You can encourage others.

00:52:54.380 --> 00:53:00.380
Kind words are so easy to speak, and yet words have power.

00:53:00.380 --> 00:53:06.380
Words can change lives, move hearts, inspire hope.

00:53:06.380 --> 00:53:13.380
We are surrounded by a world that's increasingly self-centered, fault-finding, and thankless.

00:53:13.380 --> 00:53:16.380
Our brothers and sisters need to feel love and appreciate it.

00:53:16.380 --> 00:53:19.380
They need to be sincerely commended.

00:53:19.380 --> 00:53:27.380
And when we do that, we uplift them, we encourage them, and praise helps all of us to do our very best.

00:53:27.380 --> 00:53:32.380
So, do you want to be a strengthening aid to your brothers?

00:53:32.380 --> 00:53:34.380
Appreciate them.

00:53:34.380 --> 00:53:37.380
Do you want to motivate and encourage others?

00:53:37.380 --> 00:53:39.380
Approve them.

00:53:39.380 --> 00:53:43.380
Do you want to build others up in their self-worth, their self-esteem, their self-confidence?

00:53:43.380 --> 00:53:45.380
Applaud them.

00:53:45.380 --> 00:53:53.380
Do you want to strengthen the warmth and security and appreciation among your fellow Bethel family members?

00:53:53.380 --> 00:53:57.380
And in your congregation, acknowledge them.

00:53:57.380 --> 00:54:03.380
Train yourself to look for the good and others, and then freely give voice to the positive.

00:54:03.380 --> 00:54:12.380
Remember, Jehovah sees even the tiniest of effort in his service, and he counts it as an act of worship.

00:54:12.380 --> 00:54:20.380
A sincere word of commendation will let our brothers know that someone cares, a notice, and that what they did was worth the effort.

00:54:20.380 --> 00:54:26.690
Seek once all of God's people to feel unworthy and unloved.

00:54:26.690 --> 00:54:31.690
Do not let that happen to your brothers. Feed the hungry.

00:54:31.690 --> 00:54:37.690
Use what you've learned in the last five months to counteract the schemes of the devil.

00:54:37.690 --> 00:54:46.690
Use the power given you to strengthen God's organization to create a sense of belonging, of being a part of the greatest family on the face of the earth.

00:54:46.690 --> 00:54:49.690
Build up the brotherhood.

00:54:49.690 --> 00:54:52.690
You can do it one person at a time.

00:54:52.690 --> 00:55:01.699
Give attention to each one, young and old, each brother, each sister, each youth, every child.

00:55:01.699 --> 00:55:04.699
Help all to feel Jehovah's love and approval.

00:55:04.699 --> 00:55:07.699
By all means, feed the hungry.

00:55:07.699 --> 00:55:12.699
Do it zealously. Do it with generous amounts of love and sincere commendation.

00:55:12.699 --> 00:55:16.699
And you will be a constant source of strength and encouragement to others.

00:55:16.699 --> 00:55:19.699
You will be happier. You will be successful in your assignment.

00:55:19.699 --> 00:55:28.699
And most important of all, you will be imitating our God Jehovah, who generously expresses his approval for all of his faithful servants.

00:55:28.699 --> 00:55:48.789
For Brother Kothan, it would be negligent on my part if I didn't say, well done.

00:55:48.789 --> 00:55:51.789
So I was listening.

00:55:51.789 --> 00:55:54.789
And we appreciate very much those reminders.

00:55:54.789 --> 00:55:58.789
Well, the next speaker on our program is Brother Mark de Mare.

00:55:58.789 --> 00:56:06.789
As you realize, as one of your Gilead instructors, Brother de Mare has selected a very intriguing theme for his discussion.

00:56:06.789 --> 00:56:10.789
It's good to the last drop.

00:56:10.789 --> 00:56:19.000
As a chosen vessel, the Apostle Paul suffered for Christ's name.

00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:25.000
And yet after some 30 years of spiritual warfare, he writes his friends.

00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:29.000
And he sums up what defined his life.

00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:34.000
He sums up, this is who I am. This is what I am all about.

00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:45.260
Listen to what he reveals at Philippians chapter 2 and verse 17.

00:56:45.260 --> 00:56:53.260
Philippians 2, 17. However, even if I'm being poured out like a drink offering on the sacrifice,

00:56:53.260 --> 00:56:58.260
and the Holy service to which your faith has led you, I am glad.

00:56:58.260 --> 00:57:07.260
And I rejoice with you, pouring himself out, like a drink offering, and then says, I am glad.

00:57:07.260 --> 00:57:13.260
It's as if Paul was saying, I've received great satisfaction in pouring myself out for others.

00:57:13.260 --> 00:57:17.260
It was worth it. It was worth going the extra mile.

00:57:17.260 --> 00:57:22.260
It was worth being completely spent in behalf of kingdom interests.

00:57:22.260 --> 00:57:27.260
Anyone can give the minimum. Anyone can get by with doing the basics.

00:57:27.260 --> 00:57:32.260
But not Paul. Why? Because of the payoff.

00:57:32.260 --> 00:57:41.260
Verse 18. In the same way, you also should be glad and rejoice with me.

00:57:41.260 --> 00:57:48.260
Paul understood that his example of himself pouring himself out, not only honored Jehovah God,

00:57:48.260 --> 00:57:56.260
but it strengthened others and encouraged others so that they too could reevaluate their motives for serving God.

00:57:56.260 --> 00:58:02.260
So Paul never quit. He loved pouring himself out in behalf of kingdom interests.

00:58:02.260 --> 00:58:10.260
It's who he was. In fact, as we will see in our discussion, he was good to the last drop.

00:58:10.260 --> 00:58:18.260
Now let's rewind, Paul's life. After his baptism, he goes into Arabia.

00:58:18.260 --> 00:58:29.260
No doubt to find a quiet place where he could meditate on the scriptures, think deeply about spiritual things reflect on what proved Jesus to be the Messiah.

00:58:29.260 --> 00:58:34.260
This would prepare him for his future work and his commission.

00:58:35.260 --> 00:58:40.260
After his time in Arabia, then he goes into the regions of Syria and Selisia.

00:58:40.260 --> 00:58:51.260
He evidently experienced many hardships during these very early years, such as being in prison, mistreated, beaten with rods and shipwrecked more than once.

00:58:51.260 --> 00:58:57.260
All of this before he began his missionary career.

00:58:57.260 --> 00:59:03.260
But he didn't reason. If this is what it means to be a chosen vessel for Christ, I quit.

00:59:03.260 --> 00:59:10.260
I'm done with this. All of this suffering for what? No. He didn't adopt that attitude.

00:59:10.260 --> 00:59:16.260
Paul was determined to pour himself out. Come what may.

00:59:16.260 --> 00:59:26.260
What about you? In your early years, you too have endured hardships and trials for Christ. We know that.

00:59:26.260 --> 00:59:33.260
Some of you even as teenagers had to struggle and wrestle to stay with the truth. We know that.

00:59:33.260 --> 00:59:38.260
That's why we love you and appreciate you so much. You did not quit.

00:59:38.260 --> 00:59:43.260
You paid a price to sit in those seats at Gilead. Those seats were not free.

00:59:43.260 --> 00:59:48.260
The only free seats were the photodrama of creation. You didn't get free seats.

00:59:48.260 --> 00:59:55.260
In fact, the price tag on those seats were your loyalty, your love, your devotion, your integrity,

00:59:55.260 --> 01:00:00.260
your endurance for Jehovah God and his Theocratic organization.

01:00:00.260 --> 01:00:06.260
And your Arabia? Your Arabia has been Gilead school.

01:00:06.260 --> 01:00:13.260
A place that has enabled you to think deeply on how God's Word affects your feelings for your Heavenly Father.

01:00:13.260 --> 01:00:23.260
And because of this divine education, you are now prepared to continue to pour yourselves out in support of Jehovah God

01:00:23.260 --> 01:00:26.260
as Theocratic organization and Kingdom interest.

01:00:26.260 --> 01:00:35.260
To even a greater extent, your Arabia has prepared you for the work ahead.

01:00:35.260 --> 01:00:43.739
Well, let's go back to Paul and see what lessons his life can now teach you.

01:00:43.739 --> 01:00:53.739
After Arabia, after his previous trials in Syria, Paul continues to please Jehovah by pouring himself out into the missionary work

01:00:53.739 --> 01:01:00.739
not an easy task. He only had Matthew's gospel as an inspired writing in the Christian era.

01:01:00.739 --> 01:01:07.739
So Paul had to hammer out problems regarding unrepentant wrongdoers and marriage and singleness and, oh,

01:01:07.739 --> 01:01:11.739
there was the matter of circumcision.

01:01:11.739 --> 01:01:18.739
But what does this have to do with Paul pouring himself out to the last drop?

01:01:19.739 --> 01:01:21.739
Let's find out.

01:01:21.739 --> 01:01:28.739
The question was, should Gentile Christians be circumcised?

01:01:28.739 --> 01:01:32.739
The issue persisted for 13 years.

01:01:32.739 --> 01:01:38.739
Now, in the year 49, CE, the matter finally goes to the governing body in Jerusalem.

01:01:38.739 --> 01:01:42.739
Imagine how Paul anticipated this day.

01:01:42.739 --> 01:01:46.739
Recommendations were submitted. The issue was in the hands of the right people.

01:01:46.739 --> 01:01:51.739
Now, Paul can participate in the discussion. The congregations are a buzz.

01:01:51.739 --> 01:01:55.739
And now, the decision is made.

01:01:55.739 --> 01:02:05.530
In Acts chapter 15 and verse 23, here it is, very clear.

01:02:05.530 --> 01:02:11.530
Everyone's focused on this decision. Verse 23, the apostles and the elders, your brothers,

01:02:11.530 --> 01:02:18.530
and anti-oxerians, who are from the nations,

01:02:18.530 --> 01:02:23.530
who are from the nations, that is Gentile Christians.

01:02:23.530 --> 01:02:29.530
The decision, according to Acts chapter 15, is you Gentile Christians from the nations.

01:02:29.530 --> 01:02:34.530
You do not need to be circumcised. Good.

01:02:34.530 --> 01:02:38.530
But what about Jewish Christians?

01:02:38.530 --> 01:02:43.530
You see, the decision had not specifically covered that aspect of the question.

01:02:43.530 --> 01:02:51.530
So some Jewish Christians kept insisting that it was necessary to be circumcised in order to be saved.

01:02:51.530 --> 01:02:59.530
Now, Paul could have reasoned if the brothers could have made my work a lot easier

01:02:59.530 --> 01:03:05.530
if they just made the call that it was not a requirement for Jewish Christians to get circumcised.

01:03:05.530 --> 01:03:09.530
That's all they would have had to have done.

01:03:09.530 --> 01:03:12.530
But the issue dragged on for years.

01:03:12.530 --> 01:03:15.530
Why did Jehovah and Christ let it play out this way?

01:03:15.530 --> 01:03:21.530
We don't know, but what we do know, and here's the lesson for you, Paul did not complain.

01:03:21.530 --> 01:03:24.530
Paul did not stop working.

01:03:24.530 --> 01:03:29.530
Rather, Paul went on record by writing powerful letters to the congregations demonstrating

01:03:29.530 --> 01:03:34.530
his backing in support of the governing body's decision.

01:03:34.530 --> 01:03:38.530
What an example we want you to learn.

01:03:38.530 --> 01:03:40.530
How does it apply?

01:03:40.530 --> 01:03:45.530
No, you're not inspired to write letters, but by your speech, your attitude, your conduct,

01:03:45.530 --> 01:03:53.530
you'll go on record as to where you stand in support of the governing body's decisions.

01:03:53.530 --> 01:03:58.530
Will you always understand the reasons behind why a certain decision was made?

01:03:58.530 --> 01:04:04.530
Merger of branches, adjustments to Bethel Department's decisions regarding resources or personnel

01:04:04.530 --> 01:04:07.530
or why a situation is allowed to continue.

01:04:07.530 --> 01:04:09.530
Probably not.

01:04:09.530 --> 01:04:15.530
But whether you are a brother, sister, married, single,

01:04:15.530 --> 01:04:22.530
each one of you have this unique opportunity as a Gilead graduate to pour yourself out

01:04:22.530 --> 01:04:27.530
as a drink offering in support of the decisions that are made.

01:04:27.530 --> 01:04:36.780
Now, that is an offering that Jehovah God is well pleased to accept.

01:04:36.780 --> 01:04:38.780
Let's move forward in time.

01:04:38.780 --> 01:04:44.780
Now, Paul for years is pouring his heart and soul into his missionary work,

01:04:44.780 --> 01:04:49.780
which included near-death experiences, even as was explained by Brother Flo Dean.

01:04:49.780 --> 01:04:52.780
Now, he finishes his third missionary tour.

01:04:52.780 --> 01:04:59.780
He barely escaped with his life from that frenzied mob and emphasis and a plot to kill him in Corinth.

01:04:59.780 --> 01:05:07.780
Imagine what his life was like, pouring himself out constantly in his missionary career.

01:05:07.780 --> 01:05:11.780
And yet a big test still awaits him.

01:05:11.780 --> 01:05:15.780
This time, it comes from headquarters.

01:05:15.780 --> 01:05:20.780
He comes to Jerusalem after his third missionary tour.

01:05:20.780 --> 01:05:24.780
He's relating these encouraging experiences to the brothers.

01:05:24.780 --> 01:05:31.780
And now, what happens instead of putting a wreath on his head after his third tour?

01:05:31.780 --> 01:05:38.780
They listen to his experiences and in chapter 21 and in verse 21 of the book of Acts,

01:05:38.780 --> 01:05:40.780
what do they do?

01:05:40.780 --> 01:05:41.780
21, 21.

01:05:41.780 --> 01:05:49.659
We have heard it rumored about you that you are teaching all the Jews among the nations

01:05:49.659 --> 01:05:52.659
and apostasy from Moses.

01:05:52.659 --> 01:05:56.659
All that he did, Paul, we hear rumors about you.

01:05:56.659 --> 01:06:03.659
What you're saying about the law, some brothers think we might lack respect from Moses and our spiritual heritage.

01:06:03.659 --> 01:06:05.659
So, Paul, this is what we counsel you.

01:06:05.659 --> 01:06:06.659
You do this.

01:06:06.659 --> 01:06:10.659
You take four Jewish Christians, go to the temple in order to complete their vow.

01:06:10.659 --> 01:06:18.659
So, everyone, verse 24, everyone will know that there's nothing to the rumors they are told about you.

01:06:18.659 --> 01:06:21.909
How could he have responded here?

01:06:21.909 --> 01:06:22.909
Now, wait.

01:06:22.909 --> 01:06:24.909
Rumors about me?

01:06:24.909 --> 01:06:26.909
I just finished three missionary tours.

01:06:26.909 --> 01:06:28.909
I'm pouring myself out for the truth.

01:06:28.909 --> 01:06:30.909
I almost get killed in Ephesus.

01:06:30.909 --> 01:06:34.909
My sacrifice seems unappreciated and my good work is not acknowledged.

01:06:34.909 --> 01:06:36.909
Rumors about me?

01:06:36.909 --> 01:06:38.909
I'm the problem.

01:06:38.909 --> 01:06:39.909
No.

01:06:39.909 --> 01:06:42.909
The problem is those Jewish believers in the Mosaic law.

01:06:42.909 --> 01:06:47.909
Go tell them that the law was nailed to the stake in 33 CE.

01:06:47.909 --> 01:06:51.909
And then have them read my letter to the Romans where I proved we're not under the law.

01:06:51.909 --> 01:06:54.909
When he could have mumbled under his breath.

01:06:54.909 --> 01:06:58.909
And if we fixed this back in 49, we wouldn't even be talking about.

01:06:58.909 --> 01:07:05.460
But, Paul did not take that stand.

01:07:05.460 --> 01:07:06.460
This is the point.

01:07:06.460 --> 01:07:07.460
He didn't take that posture.

01:07:07.460 --> 01:07:11.460
Again, he cooperates with the brothers taking the lead.

01:07:11.460 --> 01:07:12.460
Why?

01:07:12.460 --> 01:07:19.460
Because he realizes that even if he was misunderstood, it's his loyalty, his obedience and his respect for theocratic order,

01:07:19.460 --> 01:07:22.460
that was part of his sacrifice.

01:07:22.460 --> 01:07:28.460
That was his drink offering that he was pouring out that he knew would gain Jehovah God's smile of approval.

01:07:28.460 --> 01:07:31.460
That's what defined him.

01:07:31.460 --> 01:07:33.460
That was Paul.

01:07:33.460 --> 01:07:39.460
So, when you go through difficulties, your motives are brought to the fore.

01:07:39.460 --> 01:07:42.460
You might feel you're not appreciated at times.

01:07:42.460 --> 01:07:44.460
Your hard work might not be recognized.

01:07:44.460 --> 01:07:49.460
Or a decision that is made might cause you inconvenience.

01:07:49.460 --> 01:07:56.460
Or at times, even something might seem inconsistent with your sense of justice.

01:07:56.460 --> 01:08:04.460
And when it does, you must realize you're not seeing things the way Jehovah sees it.

01:08:04.460 --> 01:08:09.460
Apply the Bible principles that you learned in school and watch them work.

01:08:09.460 --> 01:08:15.460
Why does Jehovah God use an eagle as a symbol of divine wisdom?

01:08:15.460 --> 01:08:17.460
Why?

01:08:17.460 --> 01:08:21.460
Because of the eagle's amazing ability to see into the future.

01:08:21.460 --> 01:08:24.460
Likewise, or see into the distance.

01:08:24.460 --> 01:08:29.460
Likewise, Jehovah God, in a similar sense, sees far into the distance.

01:08:29.460 --> 01:08:35.460
So, he can allow a situation to develop that you might not fully understand.

01:08:35.460 --> 01:08:49.460
It's under such circumstances that you yourself show yourself to be a spiritual person by continuing to pour yourself out in support of the Kingdom work.

01:08:49.460 --> 01:08:55.460
Next, Paul goes into custody, shipped off to Rome, stands trial before Caesar.

01:08:55.460 --> 01:08:57.460
After two years, he's released.

01:08:57.460 --> 01:08:59.460
Is it time for him to relax?

01:08:59.460 --> 01:09:01.460
Does he live a normal life?

01:09:01.460 --> 01:09:03.460
No. He pushes on.

01:09:03.460 --> 01:09:05.460
He resumes his missionary service.

01:09:05.460 --> 01:09:09.460
It's the Kingdom work that defines his life.

01:09:09.460 --> 01:09:13.460
Shortly before his death, he writes his last letter.

01:09:13.460 --> 01:09:19.460
He tells Timothy, I'm being poured out like a drink offering.

01:09:19.460 --> 01:09:21.460
He says it again.

01:09:21.460 --> 01:09:24.460
I've run the race to the finish.

01:09:24.460 --> 01:09:29.460
During the twilight of his life, Paul is still going.

01:09:29.460 --> 01:09:33.460
He was good to the last drop.

01:09:33.460 --> 01:09:39.460
Like Paul, your willingness to pour yourselves out on behalf of the Kingdom,

01:09:39.460 --> 01:09:49.460
behalf of the interests of Jehovah God, shows that your desire to please Jehovah and Christ is what defines you.

01:09:49.460 --> 01:09:51.460
What do you want to remember?

01:09:51.460 --> 01:09:53.460
This.

01:09:53.460 --> 01:09:59.460
One, keep going back to Arabia to immerse yourself in God's Word.

01:09:59.460 --> 01:10:09.460
Two, go on record by standing in support of Jehovah God and his faithful and discrete slave.

01:10:09.460 --> 01:10:15.460
And three, when you're dried up with nothing else to give,

01:10:15.460 --> 01:10:22.460
beg Jehovah to replenish your desire to pour yourself out into his work

01:10:22.460 --> 01:10:29.460
and may he strengthen each and every one of you to be good to the last drop.

01:10:29.460 --> 01:10:45.430
Thank you very much, brother Numer, for pouring yourself into that talk.

01:10:45.430 --> 01:10:49.430
And we certainly hope you know where near your last drop.

01:10:49.430 --> 01:10:54.430
But we appreciated the fine, interesting comments in that talk as well.

01:10:54.430 --> 01:10:57.430
But we've had a wonderful start to our program.

01:10:57.430 --> 01:11:01.430
There's been all sorts of interesting things already we've discussed.

01:11:01.430 --> 01:11:05.430
But now's an opportunity for us to sing another song.

01:11:05.430 --> 01:11:08.430
And just two things before we stand to sing the song.

01:11:08.430 --> 01:11:15.430
First of all, we'd like to mention to you and also to those who will be watching this on JW Broadcasting

01:11:15.430 --> 01:11:21.430
that will still be a few more weeks before the sheet music and the songs are uploaded.

01:11:21.430 --> 01:11:28.430
So for those watching via JW Broadcasting, listen carefully.

01:11:28.430 --> 01:11:34.430
For those of us here, keep your copy of the songs.

01:11:34.430 --> 01:11:39.430
The second thing I want to mention is how wonderful the singing was for the first song.

01:11:39.430 --> 01:11:45.430
It was just so encouraging to hear that beautiful song, song so beautifully.

01:11:45.430 --> 01:11:48.430
Well, now's the opportunity for us to stand.

01:11:48.430 --> 01:11:52.430
Most of us here probably are either pioneers or have pioneered.

01:11:52.430 --> 01:11:59.430
And we're going to sing song 140, the life of a pioneer, song 140.

01:11:59.430 --> 01:14:50.500
If you'd like to be seated again, it was beautiful.

01:14:50.500 --> 01:14:56.100
It's to express how we feel about the pioneer work.

01:14:56.100 --> 01:15:03.439
Well, the next part of our program involves experiences that the students have had.

01:15:03.439 --> 01:15:08.439
So we look forward to one of the Gilead instructors, Brother Michael Burnett,

01:15:08.439 --> 01:15:13.439
and the theme that he's selected for this interview of the experiences

01:15:13.439 --> 01:15:25.100
using the language of the heart being alert.

01:15:25.100 --> 01:15:27.100
That was so tough.

01:15:27.100 --> 01:15:28.100
It was.

01:15:28.100 --> 01:15:32.100
I still can't understand the difference between compassion and empathy.

01:15:32.100 --> 01:15:34.100
Yeah, in English, just the same to me.

01:15:34.100 --> 01:15:36.100
I don't know the difference.

01:15:36.100 --> 01:15:40.100
David, I hope I know how to show kindness,

01:15:40.100 --> 01:15:44.100
but writing the definition on a piece of paper, that's really difficult.

01:15:44.100 --> 01:15:45.100
All right.

01:15:45.100 --> 01:15:46.100
I knew I'd find you in the library.

01:15:46.100 --> 01:15:47.100
How's everyone?

01:15:47.100 --> 01:15:48.100
Well, brother Burnett.

01:15:48.100 --> 01:15:50.100
How was the written exercise?

01:15:50.100 --> 01:15:52.100
Oh, it was a little bit tricky.

01:15:52.100 --> 01:15:53.100
Really?

01:15:53.100 --> 01:15:54.100
I'm trying to forget it.

01:15:54.100 --> 01:15:58.100
I wrote the right answer for the wrong question.

01:15:58.100 --> 01:15:59.100
It happens.

01:15:59.100 --> 01:16:03.100
You know, brother Burnett, if that exercise were in our language,

01:16:03.100 --> 01:16:06.100
own language, that would be much more easy.

01:16:06.100 --> 01:16:09.100
I mean, you're saying if you were in Russian, you'd do better.

01:16:09.100 --> 01:16:10.100
Why not?

01:16:10.100 --> 01:16:11.100
Okay.

01:16:11.100 --> 01:16:16.100
It reminds me of the lecture we had yesterday regarding the tongue of the heart

01:16:16.100 --> 01:16:20.100
and how people do much better when you speak their language to convey the truth.

01:16:20.100 --> 01:16:25.100
And that's true, brother Burnett, because I had a very nice experience with Russian woman.

01:16:25.100 --> 01:16:26.100
I would like to show you.

01:16:26.100 --> 01:16:27.100
Da.

01:16:27.100 --> 01:16:34.159
Hello, a learner.

01:16:34.159 --> 01:16:36.159
It's lovely to see you again.

01:16:36.159 --> 01:16:38.159
This is my friend Anura.

01:16:38.159 --> 01:16:40.159
Hello, my name is Anura.

01:16:40.159 --> 01:16:41.159
Oh, здравствуйте!

01:16:41.159 --> 01:16:43.159
Вы говорите по-русски!

01:16:43.159 --> 01:16:47.159
Как приятно встретить человека, который говорит на Твоём родном языке?

01:16:47.159 --> 01:16:51.159
А мне как приятно говорить в доля дома тоже на одном языке.

01:16:51.159 --> 01:16:52.159
You found a person who is speaking Russian.

01:16:52.159 --> 01:16:56.159
Isn't it lovely to talk to someone in the language of your heart?

01:16:56.159 --> 01:16:57.159
Yes.

01:16:57.159 --> 01:16:58.159
It's a call to the outside coming.

01:16:58.159 --> 01:16:59.159
Thank you.

01:16:59.159 --> 01:17:00.159
Thank You.

01:17:00.159 --> 01:17:04.159
You know, I don't have much time because I need to pay a lunch.

01:17:04.159 --> 01:17:05.159
Oh, don't worry.

01:17:05.159 --> 01:17:06.159
It will not take too much.

01:17:06.159 --> 01:17:09.159
But by the way, what are you doing here?

01:17:09.159 --> 01:17:18.539
You know, the thing that we are invited to Bible school, and there are a lot of people

01:17:18.539 --> 01:17:24.140
from different countries in our class, for example, from 29 countries.

01:17:24.140 --> 01:17:29.460
Wow, yes, and the purpose of the school is to teach us the Bible so that we could speak

01:17:29.460 --> 01:17:33.460
with people about God.

01:17:33.460 --> 01:17:37.859
Oh, you know, actually I don't believe in God as a person.

01:17:37.859 --> 01:17:40.859
I know there is something who is great power.

01:17:40.859 --> 01:17:43.539
Maybe we were brought here from different planets.

01:17:43.539 --> 01:17:47.260
I'd like to watch some program about the universe.

01:17:47.260 --> 01:17:50.020
Maybe I will believe in God if I see him.

01:17:50.020 --> 01:17:51.020
Very interesting.

01:17:51.020 --> 01:17:55.939
Folks, thank you very much for sharing that, but look around you.

01:17:55.939 --> 01:17:59.420
Everything was created, but people create things too.

01:17:59.420 --> 01:18:03.060
Yes, you're right, they create, but what do they use?

01:18:03.060 --> 01:18:05.699
They think they are already created by someone.

01:18:05.699 --> 01:18:06.699
Oh, I understand.

01:18:06.699 --> 01:18:10.060
And you want to say that all things created by God.

01:18:10.060 --> 01:18:11.060
You know what?

01:18:11.060 --> 01:18:17.699
As you said that you like to watch some films about the universe and so on.

01:18:17.699 --> 01:18:22.819
I have a book, it's called, is there a creator that cares about us?

01:18:22.819 --> 01:18:27.020
And this book contains so much scientific information.

01:18:27.020 --> 01:18:32.619
I like this book very much, it's so interesting, and I can find it in Russian and bring it

01:18:32.619 --> 01:18:33.619
to you.

01:18:33.619 --> 01:18:34.619
Yeah, it's good.

01:18:34.619 --> 01:18:36.619
What time do you want me to bring it?

01:18:36.859 --> 01:18:38.859
Any afternoon will be okay.

01:18:38.859 --> 01:18:41.100
So next Sunday afternoon, is it okay?

01:18:41.100 --> 01:18:42.100
Yeah.

01:18:42.100 --> 01:18:43.100
That's good.

01:18:43.100 --> 01:18:44.100
Thank you.

01:18:44.100 --> 01:18:45.100
See you.

01:18:45.100 --> 01:18:46.100
Nice to know.

01:18:46.100 --> 01:18:47.100
The tongue of the heart.

01:18:47.100 --> 01:18:51.880
How nice.

01:18:51.880 --> 01:18:55.520
So were you able to take the creator book back in Russian?

01:18:55.520 --> 01:19:03.520
Not that week, as I promised, but I found in Russian Bible, and I took that book in English

01:19:03.520 --> 01:19:05.359
and brought her.

01:19:05.359 --> 01:19:10.920
And when I found it in Russian, I visited her and apologized, explained why it took

01:19:10.920 --> 01:19:12.560
to a long time.

01:19:12.560 --> 01:19:19.920
And I said that since I'm in English congregation, I had to ask brothers and sisters from Russian

01:19:19.920 --> 01:19:21.199
congregation.

01:19:21.199 --> 01:19:28.239
So when she heard that there is people that are speaking in Russian, she wanted to go

01:19:28.239 --> 01:19:29.239
to the meeting.

01:19:29.239 --> 01:19:30.720
I didn't even invite her.

01:19:30.720 --> 01:19:32.199
That is very nice.

01:19:32.199 --> 01:19:33.199
Very nice.

01:19:33.199 --> 01:19:36.840
Very persistent, consistent, and you spoke the tongue of the heart.

01:19:36.840 --> 01:19:37.840
Well done.

01:19:37.840 --> 01:19:38.840
Yes.

01:19:38.840 --> 01:19:39.840
And that was very interesting.

01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:40.840
And you know Brother Brunette?

01:19:40.840 --> 01:19:42.720
Gwen also has a very nice experience.

01:19:42.720 --> 01:19:43.720
Really?

01:19:43.720 --> 01:19:48.640
When the brothers found out that I was assigned to the Piquitzi area, they sent me two territories

01:19:48.640 --> 01:19:50.119
with Albanian addresses.

01:19:50.119 --> 01:19:51.119
Good.

01:19:51.119 --> 01:19:55.520
And one morning, we've been doing the addresses, and we haven't found anybody in.

01:19:55.520 --> 01:20:00.920
Finally, we met a woman, but she said she wasn't Albanian, but it turned out well.

01:20:00.920 --> 01:20:01.920
I'd like to see you.

01:20:01.920 --> 01:20:13.000
Hello.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:14.000
Hello.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:15.000
Oh, hi.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:16.800
Can I just ask you a question, please?

01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:19.439
Are there any Albanians living in this block?

01:20:19.439 --> 01:20:20.439
In this block?

01:20:20.439 --> 01:20:21.439
No.

01:20:21.439 --> 01:20:22.439
No Albanians.

01:20:22.439 --> 01:20:23.439
Oh, that's such a shame.

01:20:23.439 --> 01:20:24.439
Why?

01:20:24.439 --> 01:20:30.560
Well, I've lived in Albania for 12 years, and I was so hoping to meet an Albanian family,

01:20:30.560 --> 01:20:33.880
especially with the subject that we were talking about today.

01:20:33.880 --> 01:20:34.880
What's that about?

01:20:34.880 --> 01:20:35.880
Happiness.

01:20:35.880 --> 01:20:38.560
I mean, we all want to be happy, don't we?

01:20:38.560 --> 01:20:41.680
And even if we are happy, we want to be happy yet.

01:20:41.680 --> 01:20:47.279
But maybe I can ask you, what do you think are some of the keys that can help us find

01:20:47.279 --> 01:20:49.119
true happiness today?

01:20:49.119 --> 01:20:50.119
True happiness.

01:20:50.119 --> 01:20:51.119
Hmm.

01:20:51.119 --> 01:20:52.840
A good family, a nice job, perhaps?

01:20:52.840 --> 01:20:54.520
Those things are important.

01:20:54.520 --> 01:20:59.880
And I know while I was in Albania, I noticed that for the Albanians, the family was something

01:20:59.880 --> 01:21:05.600
very important, trying to keep them close together, but today it's not easy, especially

01:21:05.600 --> 01:21:10.640
with the fact that many have to leave the country to maybe work abroad.

01:21:10.640 --> 01:21:16.079
But we were highlighting some principles from the holy scriptures from our creator that

01:21:16.079 --> 01:21:20.000
can help us to find even more happiness today.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:25.319
You know, I said to you that there are no Albanians here, but actually I'm Albania.

01:21:25.319 --> 01:21:26.319
That's wonderful.

01:21:26.319 --> 01:21:29.000
But I don't speak any of Albania, I'm country, sorry.

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:30.000
Don't worry.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
I have the magazines in English as well.

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:33.000
Really?

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:34.000
Yeah.

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.840
It's speaking about keys to family happiness.

01:21:36.840 --> 01:21:39.800
I'm sure you'd really enjoy eating it.

01:21:39.800 --> 01:21:42.880
And I ask you, what part of Albania do you come from?

01:21:42.880 --> 01:21:44.479
I'm from Ulcin, Montenegro.

01:21:44.479 --> 01:21:46.079
Oh, it's beautiful there.

01:21:46.079 --> 01:21:47.880
I love the beaches I've been.

01:21:47.880 --> 01:21:48.880
Yeah.

01:21:48.880 --> 01:21:50.560
Do you have families still there?

01:21:50.560 --> 01:21:51.720
My entire family is there.

01:21:51.720 --> 01:21:53.520
You know, I'm alone in the United States.

01:21:53.520 --> 01:21:57.279
Oh, it must be very difficult being such a long way away from your family.

01:21:57.279 --> 01:21:58.279
Yeah, it is.

01:21:58.279 --> 01:22:00.960
I'm sorry, I never introduced myself.

01:22:00.960 --> 01:22:01.960
My name's Gwen.

01:22:01.960 --> 01:22:02.960
Can I ask your name?

01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:03.960
Afredita.

01:22:03.960 --> 01:22:04.960
Oh, Afredita.

01:22:04.960 --> 01:22:05.960
Nice to meet you.

01:22:05.960 --> 01:22:06.960
Nice to meet you.

01:22:06.960 --> 01:22:07.960
Lovely meeting you.

01:22:07.960 --> 01:22:09.800
I'll be back in the area again.

01:22:09.800 --> 01:22:14.960
And I'd love to show you something so positive for the future that God's promised us, that

01:22:14.960 --> 01:22:16.960
can touch us and our families.

01:22:16.960 --> 01:22:19.399
Is the morning all the afternoon better?

01:22:19.399 --> 01:22:21.199
Usually, afternoon is better for me.

01:22:21.199 --> 01:22:23.479
OK, I'll try next Sunday afternoon.

01:22:23.479 --> 01:22:24.479
Looking forward to it.

01:22:24.479 --> 01:22:25.479
OK, bye-bye.

01:22:25.479 --> 01:22:26.479
Good for you, Gwen.

01:22:26.479 --> 01:22:27.479
Thank you.

01:22:27.479 --> 01:22:28.479
Very nice.

01:22:28.479 --> 01:22:36.789
And the nice thing is that you got to talk to her in the tongue of the heart.

01:22:36.789 --> 01:22:37.789
English.

01:22:37.789 --> 01:22:38.789
That's right.

01:22:38.789 --> 01:22:39.789
Yeah.

01:22:40.189 --> 01:22:42.310
So you've been able to call back?

01:22:42.310 --> 01:22:43.829
That's, I tried a couple of times.

01:22:43.829 --> 01:22:47.029
She was quite hard to find in, but I did get a good result.

01:22:47.029 --> 01:22:47.909
I'll show you again.

01:22:47.909 --> 01:22:54.250
Let's see.

01:22:54.250 --> 01:22:55.250
Gwen, what?

01:22:55.250 --> 01:22:56.250
Good, Dita.

01:22:56.250 --> 01:22:57.250
How are you?

01:22:57.250 --> 01:22:58.250
Good, good.

01:22:58.250 --> 01:22:59.250
How are you?

01:22:59.250 --> 01:23:00.250
Fine, thank you.

01:23:00.250 --> 01:23:02.050
You know, you're very fortunate to find me at home.

01:23:02.050 --> 01:23:04.329
I was just getting ready to go out.

01:23:04.329 --> 01:23:09.489
I appreciate that because I try quite a few times, so I know you're a really busy person.

01:23:09.489 --> 01:23:13.329
But have you got five minutes for me to show you that interesting point?

01:23:13.329 --> 01:23:14.329
Sure.

01:23:14.329 --> 01:23:19.729
I brought a little brochure with me that's entitled Good News from God, and I've got a

01:23:19.729 --> 01:23:21.250
copy for you as well.

01:23:21.250 --> 01:23:22.250
Thank you.

01:23:22.250 --> 01:23:23.250
OK.

01:23:23.250 --> 01:23:28.850
And if we have a read of the first paragraph together, what strikes you as being something

01:23:28.850 --> 01:23:29.850
that's good news?

01:23:29.850 --> 01:23:34.529
Well, the last sentence is, you will relieve mankind of the causes of suffering.

01:23:34.529 --> 01:23:36.130
That sounds very good.

01:23:36.130 --> 01:23:37.649
That's something that we need, don't we?

01:23:37.649 --> 01:23:38.649
Yes.

01:23:38.649 --> 01:23:42.010
But how do we know that it's God that's promised us that?

01:23:42.010 --> 01:23:46.090
If you notice here, there's a scripture, and I'll show you what it says.

01:23:46.090 --> 01:23:49.970
It's Jeremiah 29, verse 11.

01:23:49.970 --> 01:23:53.409
So after reading that, what does God promise us?

01:23:53.409 --> 01:23:55.489
A future and a hope.

01:23:55.489 --> 01:23:56.489
That's right.

01:23:56.489 --> 01:24:01.489
Isn't that wonderful to think that our creator has promised that for us?

01:24:01.489 --> 01:24:04.250
But how is he going to bring it about?

01:24:04.250 --> 01:24:07.850
Because it's something so different from what we see today.

01:24:07.850 --> 01:24:11.529
The next paragraph tells us, but you said you only had five minutes.

01:24:11.529 --> 01:24:12.529
Yes.

01:24:12.529 --> 01:24:15.329
I'll leave the brochure for you to read by yourself.

01:24:15.329 --> 01:24:20.170
And then next Sunday, I'll come again, and I'll show you what the scriptures say on

01:24:20.170 --> 01:24:21.170
the subject.

01:24:21.170 --> 01:24:22.170
OK.

01:24:22.170 --> 01:24:23.170
Sounds great.

01:24:23.170 --> 01:24:24.170
OK.

01:24:24.170 --> 01:24:25.170
That's all I asked for.

01:24:25.170 --> 01:24:26.170
Thank you.

01:24:26.170 --> 01:24:31.880
Good reasoning, Gwen.

01:24:31.880 --> 01:24:32.880
Very nice.

01:24:32.880 --> 01:24:33.880
So what is her progress now?

01:24:33.880 --> 01:24:39.680
Well, I managed to start a study with Aphrodita, and she also wanted her mum to know about

01:24:39.680 --> 01:24:40.680
it as well.

01:24:40.680 --> 01:24:45.079
I mentioned that I was here at Patterson, and she said she'd actually visited Patterson

01:24:45.079 --> 01:24:48.920
when she was a little girl, but she can't remember much about it.

01:24:48.920 --> 01:24:52.600
So I've invited her to come, and she's going to come with her mother as well.

01:24:52.600 --> 01:24:53.600
Good.

01:24:53.600 --> 01:24:54.600
Can you bring her around like a meter?

01:24:54.600 --> 01:24:55.600
I'd love that.

01:24:55.600 --> 01:24:56.600
That's great.

01:24:56.600 --> 01:24:57.600
That's great.

01:24:57.600 --> 01:25:01.000
And she also asked, when I go back to Albania, could I give her my Albanian telephone

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:05.479
number so that her mum can keep in contact with me because she's in Toronto, too?

01:25:05.479 --> 01:25:06.479
What a nice experience.

01:25:06.479 --> 01:25:07.479
Thank you.

01:25:07.479 --> 01:25:10.680
Mireille, I'm just going to print up those references for the next lesson.

01:25:10.680 --> 01:25:12.079
I'll do a copy for you as well.

01:25:12.079 --> 01:25:13.079
Thank you.

01:25:13.079 --> 01:25:14.079
Thank you, Mireille.

01:25:14.079 --> 01:25:15.079
See you in class, OK?

01:25:15.079 --> 01:25:16.079
See you.

01:25:16.079 --> 01:25:18.880
So, Mireille, I understand that you found someone who speaks Arabic.

01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:19.880
Yes, I did.

01:25:19.880 --> 01:25:22.560
It was two Lebanese men who work in a daddy.

01:25:22.560 --> 01:25:25.880
Now, a local sister had been taking the magazines in Arabic.

01:25:25.880 --> 01:25:30.079
Once she took me with her, and when I went, the conversation just started up naturally

01:25:30.079 --> 01:25:32.399
because we speak the same language.

01:25:32.399 --> 01:25:36.279
But the store was busy at that time, so we just gave them two magazines.

01:25:36.279 --> 01:25:38.920
One of them, his name is Khalid, he took them.

01:25:38.920 --> 01:25:40.760
And we promised to return.

01:25:40.760 --> 01:25:43.079
I did return with a couple from the congregation.

01:25:43.079 --> 01:25:44.079
We also had lunch.

01:25:44.079 --> 01:25:46.079
You know, you can't resist the food.

01:25:46.079 --> 01:25:53.119
But we also, I had in mind one article that is interesting for people from our area.

01:25:53.119 --> 01:25:56.600
And I got it ready, and I was waiting for a good time to talk to him.

01:25:56.600 --> 01:25:57.600
Can I show you what happened?

01:25:57.600 --> 01:25:58.600
Thank you.

01:25:58.600 --> 01:26:11.529
Thank you.

01:26:11.529 --> 01:26:12.529
Thank you.

01:26:12.529 --> 01:26:13.529
Thank you.

01:26:13.529 --> 01:26:14.529
Thank you.

01:26:14.529 --> 01:26:25.930
This article, I think it's interesting for people from our area.

01:26:25.930 --> 01:26:26.930
What do you think?

01:26:26.930 --> 01:26:30.729
Will we ever have one government for the whole world?

01:26:30.729 --> 01:26:31.729
One government?

01:26:31.729 --> 01:26:32.729
Yes.

01:26:32.729 --> 01:26:33.729
I don't think so.

01:26:33.729 --> 01:26:34.729
Why not?

01:26:34.729 --> 01:26:35.729
What if this government will be bad?

01:26:35.729 --> 01:26:36.729
Yes.

01:26:36.729 --> 01:26:37.729
You're all right.

01:26:37.729 --> 01:26:39.729
That would be harmful.

01:26:39.729 --> 01:26:42.329
But what if God is the one who got that government?

01:26:42.329 --> 01:26:44.329
Wouldn't that be good for us?

01:26:44.529 --> 01:26:45.930
This is a good idea.

01:26:45.930 --> 01:26:48.729
Actually, this is the message that we preach.

01:26:48.729 --> 01:26:52.729
And as you can see here, this message is found in God's Word.

01:26:52.729 --> 01:26:54.930
God's prophets wrote about it.

01:26:54.930 --> 01:27:03.729
And both of us, Muslims and Christians, we believe that God will act at one time, that He gave us signs for that time when He will act.

01:27:03.729 --> 01:27:09.529
And if we look around us now with all the problems, don't you think that this time might be now?

01:27:09.529 --> 01:27:10.529
Yes.

01:27:10.529 --> 01:27:11.529
You're right.

01:27:11.529 --> 01:27:12.529
Okay.

01:27:12.529 --> 01:27:13.529
Customers have come in.

01:27:13.529 --> 01:27:14.529
I don't want to keep.

01:27:14.529 --> 01:27:15.529
You will continue later.

01:27:15.529 --> 01:27:16.529
Wow.

01:27:16.529 --> 01:27:18.529
That was really good, but I am well done.

01:27:18.529 --> 01:27:19.529
Well done.

01:27:19.529 --> 01:27:20.529
Very good.

01:27:20.529 --> 01:27:22.529
Well, what a lovely meal that was.

01:27:22.529 --> 01:27:25.529
Should I go and get the car and I'll bring it out and pick up your girls?

01:27:25.529 --> 01:27:26.529
Okay.

01:27:26.529 --> 01:27:27.529
I'll try to wrap up and then I'll meet you.

01:27:27.529 --> 01:27:28.529
I'll get the car.

01:27:28.529 --> 01:27:33.369
Thank you.

01:27:33.369 --> 01:27:35.369
May I have a box for the leftovers, please?

01:27:35.369 --> 01:27:36.369
Yes.

01:27:36.369 --> 01:27:37.369
Thank you.

01:27:37.369 --> 01:27:41.369
You know, I really enjoyed when witnesses come here.

01:27:41.369 --> 01:27:42.369
They always do.

01:27:42.369 --> 01:27:44.369
And I think you are good people.

01:27:44.369 --> 01:27:45.369
Thank you.

01:27:45.369 --> 01:27:46.369
Thank you, Card.

01:27:46.369 --> 01:27:48.369
And a small truck.

01:27:48.369 --> 01:27:50.369
They sent me from Canada after dining here.

01:27:50.369 --> 01:27:51.369
Oh, that's nice.

01:27:51.369 --> 01:27:52.369
Ah, yes.

01:27:52.369 --> 01:27:54.369
Distracted advertising is our website.

01:27:54.369 --> 01:27:55.369
Yes, I'm agree.

01:27:55.369 --> 01:27:56.369
Witnesses are good people.

01:27:56.369 --> 01:27:58.369
I used to live in Michigan.

01:27:58.369 --> 01:28:03.369
And I know that one couple who became believers and witnesses helped them.

01:28:03.369 --> 01:28:08.369
You know, living according to God's word and listening to Him improves our lives.

01:28:08.369 --> 01:28:14.369
Because can you imagine, for example, if a father is an alcoholic and then the Bible God's

01:28:14.369 --> 01:28:18.369
help helps him to overcome his addiction, how much would that help his family?

01:28:18.369 --> 01:28:20.369
Wouldn't their lives improve so much?

01:28:20.369 --> 01:28:21.369
Yes, it will.

01:28:21.369 --> 01:28:22.369
Exactly.

01:28:22.369 --> 01:28:25.369
So when will you come to study Bible with me?

01:28:25.369 --> 01:28:31.369
Well, I can return with my brothers maybe next week, but we won't take too much of your time

01:28:31.369 --> 01:28:33.369
because this is our workplace.

01:28:33.369 --> 01:28:34.369
Okay.

01:28:34.369 --> 01:28:35.369
Thank you.

01:28:35.369 --> 01:28:36.369
Wow.

01:28:36.369 --> 01:28:43.329
That's incredible.

01:28:43.329 --> 01:28:46.329
All of you are starting Bible studies.

01:28:46.329 --> 01:28:48.329
I know the store owners are busy.

01:28:48.329 --> 01:28:50.329
So what's the progress of this call?

01:28:50.329 --> 01:28:58.329
Well, when I returned the next time, the chef, Haile, turned out to have read our books back in Lebanon.

01:28:58.329 --> 01:29:02.329
But because of the workload, he finds it hard to study.

01:29:02.329 --> 01:29:08.329
So we agreed that we would just only take 10 minutes every week just to do a quick discussion.

01:29:08.329 --> 01:29:10.329
And then that's what we've been trying to do.

01:29:10.329 --> 01:29:12.329
Progress in the tongue of the heart.

01:29:12.329 --> 01:29:13.329
Good for you.

01:29:13.329 --> 01:29:14.329
Thank you.

01:29:14.329 --> 01:29:18.329
I know, even when you can't speak the language of the heart,

01:29:18.329 --> 01:29:24.329
learning a few greetings and introduction in the language of the people can make a lot of difference.

01:29:24.329 --> 01:29:25.329
That's true.

01:29:25.329 --> 01:29:34.329
I remember when I was here, one of the Saturdays, the brothers told me that we'll be preaching in a territory that has some Spanish-speaking families.

01:29:34.329 --> 01:29:39.329
I can't speak Spanish, but I thought of learning a few greetings and introduction in Spanish.

01:29:39.329 --> 01:29:40.329
Nice.

01:29:40.329 --> 01:29:41.329
This is what happened in my room.

01:29:41.329 --> 01:29:42.329
Thank you.

01:29:42.329 --> 01:29:50.329
That morning, while I was getting ready for the field service, I decided to learn greetings in Spanish.

01:29:50.329 --> 01:30:01.329
I started with pulling up the JW language app, JW language app, and I started with hello in Spanish.

01:30:01.329 --> 01:30:06.119
Now, how do I say hello?

01:30:06.119 --> 01:30:07.119
Hola.

01:30:07.119 --> 01:30:08.119
Hola.

01:30:08.119 --> 01:30:09.119
Hola.

01:30:09.119 --> 01:30:12.430
Hola.

01:30:12.430 --> 01:30:13.430
Hola.

01:30:13.430 --> 01:30:14.430
Hola.

01:30:14.430 --> 01:30:15.430
Hola.

01:30:15.430 --> 01:30:16.430
Hola.

01:30:16.430 --> 01:30:19.430
That I also thought of, my name is.

01:30:19.430 --> 01:30:21.430
My name is.

01:30:21.430 --> 01:30:23.430
Me llamo.

01:30:23.430 --> 01:30:24.430
Mijamo.

01:30:24.430 --> 01:30:25.430
Me llamo.

01:30:25.430 --> 01:30:26.430
Me llamo.

01:30:26.430 --> 01:30:27.430
Oh.

01:30:27.430 --> 01:30:32.590
Me llamo.

01:30:32.590 --> 01:30:34.590
Okay.

01:30:34.590 --> 01:30:36.590
I think I'm good.

01:30:36.590 --> 01:30:38.590
Very good.

01:30:38.590 --> 01:30:44.869
So, that's great, Dave.

01:30:44.869 --> 01:30:46.869
So, with a confidence of each other,

01:30:46.869 --> 01:30:55.869
So, with the confidence of the JW language app, I went out in the field ministry that morning and you can't believe it.

01:30:55.869 --> 01:31:00.869
Right on the sidewalk, a man walked by using what I learned with the JW language app.

01:31:00.869 --> 01:31:03.869
I was able to start a Bible study right there.

01:31:03.869 --> 01:31:07.979
This is what I learned.

01:31:07.979 --> 01:31:09.979
He looks Spanish.

01:31:09.979 --> 01:31:11.979
Is it Spanish?

01:31:11.979 --> 01:31:12.979
What?

01:31:12.979 --> 01:31:14.979
What are you looking at?

01:31:14.979 --> 01:31:15.979
Hola.

01:31:15.979 --> 01:31:17.979
Hola.

01:31:17.979 --> 01:31:18.979
Comestas.

01:31:18.979 --> 01:31:19.979
Bien.

01:31:19.979 --> 01:31:22.979
Mayama David.

01:31:22.979 --> 01:31:24.979
A blue standing glass.

01:31:24.979 --> 01:31:26.979
CC, I do speak English.

01:31:26.979 --> 01:31:27.979
Wow.

01:31:27.979 --> 01:31:30.979
I have a message from God for you.

01:31:30.979 --> 01:31:31.979
Hmm.

01:31:31.979 --> 01:31:32.979
I know God.

01:31:32.979 --> 01:31:35.979
But what is the message about?

01:31:35.979 --> 01:31:39.979
God wants you to be his friend.

01:31:39.979 --> 01:31:41.979
Interesting.

01:31:41.979 --> 01:31:43.979
But how is that possible?

01:31:43.979 --> 01:31:44.979
Wow.

01:31:44.979 --> 01:31:45.979
I'll show you.

01:31:45.979 --> 01:31:50.979
Here in the Bible, it is 6th chapter 12 by 13.

01:31:50.979 --> 01:31:51.979
Do you mind reading?

01:31:51.979 --> 01:31:52.979
No.

01:31:52.979 --> 01:31:53.979
I can read.

01:31:53.979 --> 01:31:54.979
Okay.

01:31:54.979 --> 01:32:02.979
The conclusion of the matter, everything having been heard is, feel the true God and keep his commandments.

01:32:02.979 --> 01:32:05.979
For this is the whole obligation of man.

01:32:05.979 --> 01:32:06.979
Wonderful.

01:32:06.979 --> 01:32:10.979
If you notice carefully, there are two expressions.

01:32:10.979 --> 01:32:13.979
One, fear the true God.

01:32:13.979 --> 01:32:16.979
Two, keep his commandments.

01:32:16.979 --> 01:32:24.979
If you are able to do this, God will be so real to you that he will become a friend.

01:32:24.979 --> 01:32:25.979
Interesting.

01:32:25.979 --> 01:32:30.979
But fear God, be close to him.

01:32:30.979 --> 01:32:32.979
We cannot see God.

01:32:32.979 --> 01:32:34.979
I agree with you.

01:32:34.979 --> 01:32:39.979
And most people have had this discussion with, they feel the same way.

01:32:39.979 --> 01:32:40.979
You can't see God.

01:32:40.979 --> 01:32:42.979
How can you fear him?

01:32:42.979 --> 01:32:46.979
As Jehovah's Witnesses, we have a program that can help.

01:32:46.979 --> 01:32:49.979
We call it Bible Study.

01:32:49.979 --> 01:32:51.979
Here is a Bible Study Earth.

01:32:51.979 --> 01:32:54.979
What does the Bible really teach?

01:32:54.979 --> 01:33:01.979
If you look at the table of content, you will notice that there are like 19 chapters.

01:33:01.979 --> 01:33:08.979
And all these chapters were prepared to help you draw clues to God, even when you can't see Him.

01:33:08.979 --> 01:33:13.380
Have a look.

01:33:13.380 --> 01:33:15.380
I would like to know this answer.

01:33:15.380 --> 01:33:18.380
Why does God allow suffering?

01:33:18.380 --> 01:33:22.380
Wow, that seems to be a subject of the heart for you.

01:33:22.380 --> 01:33:27.380
I would have loved to demonstrate how this Bible Study program works.

01:33:27.380 --> 01:33:29.380
But you know we are on the sidewalk.

01:33:29.380 --> 01:33:30.380
How about this?

01:33:30.380 --> 01:33:31.380
I keep it there to you.

01:33:31.380 --> 01:33:36.380
Next week, just about this time, 3 p.m. but at your home.

01:33:36.380 --> 01:33:38.380
Then I'll demonstrate this Bible Study for you.

01:33:38.380 --> 01:33:39.380
How about that?

01:33:39.380 --> 01:33:41.380
Okay, you can come.

01:33:41.380 --> 01:33:45.380
My house is that house, white house number 138.

01:33:45.380 --> 01:33:47.380
Oh, 138.

01:33:47.380 --> 01:33:54.380
Okay, so by next week, by Saturday, 3 p.m., I will be at your home.

01:33:54.380 --> 01:33:57.380
And then we will have a Bible Study.

01:33:57.380 --> 01:34:00.380
Like I said, my name is David.

01:34:00.380 --> 01:34:02.380
My name is Haul.

01:34:02.380 --> 01:34:03.380
Hasta la vista.

01:34:03.380 --> 01:34:04.380
Hasta la vista.

01:34:04.380 --> 01:34:08.939
Hasta la vista.

01:34:08.939 --> 01:34:16.470
Muito gracias.

01:34:16.470 --> 01:34:17.470
That was very good.

01:34:17.470 --> 01:34:18.470
Very nice, David.

01:34:18.470 --> 01:34:22.470
So that language, really, has proven to be a blessing.

01:34:22.470 --> 01:34:25.470
Yes, it was really a wonderful blessing.

01:34:25.470 --> 01:34:26.470
I had confidence.

01:34:26.470 --> 01:34:33.470
And like we promised Raul, we went back next Saturday and wanted to demonstrate a Bible Study

01:34:33.470 --> 01:34:35.470
where you can't believe it.

01:34:35.470 --> 01:34:36.470
Raul was waiting.

01:34:36.470 --> 01:34:41.470
His wife, his mother, who can speak English and his two children.

01:34:41.470 --> 01:34:43.470
We demonstrated the Bible Study for Raul.

01:34:43.470 --> 01:34:46.949
But we noticed all of them were so interested in a Bible study.

01:34:46.949 --> 01:34:48.949
They were so excited.

01:34:48.949 --> 01:34:52.710
And then we decided to have a Bible study for each one of them.

01:34:52.710 --> 01:34:57.069
And today, all five of them are regular Bible students.

01:34:57.069 --> 01:34:58.229
That's incredible.

01:34:58.229 --> 01:34:58.750
Good for you.

01:34:58.750 --> 01:34:59.949
You're over-splashing.

01:34:59.949 --> 01:35:01.149
Thank you.

01:35:01.149 --> 01:35:06.760
Thank you very much.

01:35:06.760 --> 01:35:08.760
Thank you very much.

01:35:08.760 --> 01:35:10.520
Hello, hello, friends.

01:35:10.520 --> 01:35:12.000
You were still here.

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.560
It's time for Brassam Lawson to begin his class.

01:35:14.560 --> 01:35:15.319
Brassam Lawson?

01:35:15.319 --> 01:35:15.800
Yes.

01:35:15.800 --> 01:35:16.319
Sorry.

01:35:16.319 --> 01:35:17.319
I'm out of time.

01:35:17.399 --> 01:35:18.199
Thank you.

01:35:18.199 --> 01:35:18.840
OK, see you.

01:35:18.840 --> 01:35:20.399
See you.

01:35:20.399 --> 01:35:21.399
Hi, Brassam Lawson.

01:35:21.399 --> 01:35:22.079
Who do you think?

01:35:22.079 --> 01:35:22.600
I mean, who are you?

01:35:22.600 --> 01:35:24.039
You have a very well-entry speaking nowadays.

01:35:24.039 --> 01:35:24.720
Try it.

01:35:24.720 --> 01:35:25.520
I think we should go to Ghana.

01:35:25.520 --> 01:35:26.720
I do.

01:35:26.720 --> 01:35:27.399
That's good.

01:35:27.399 --> 01:35:28.880
So how are things?

01:35:28.880 --> 01:35:30.680
Oh, everything is fine, Brassam Lawson.

01:35:30.680 --> 01:35:33.039
Well, there's some interest being discussed here.

01:35:33.039 --> 01:35:34.880
Yes, we were talking about the language of the heart

01:35:34.880 --> 01:35:38.239
and each one of these students speaks it for a night.

01:35:38.239 --> 01:35:39.399
Oh, sorry.

01:35:39.399 --> 01:35:40.239
Oh, sorry.

01:35:40.239 --> 01:35:40.880
Oh, good.

01:35:40.880 --> 01:35:42.479
Discussing about something?

01:35:42.479 --> 01:35:43.920
Yeah, we're just talking about the students

01:35:43.920 --> 01:35:45.640
who went back to Brassam Lawson's class.

01:35:45.640 --> 01:35:50.159
We're talking about the studies they've started in the language of the heart, the languages

01:35:50.159 --> 01:35:51.159
they speak.

01:35:51.159 --> 01:35:52.159
Interesting.

01:35:52.159 --> 01:35:56.479
Robert, you know, speaking of language of the heart, I didn't go to this experience like

01:35:56.479 --> 01:35:57.479
that.

01:35:57.479 --> 01:36:03.779
But I had a similar one, being a lead and prepared with magazines on hand, even in a coffee

01:36:03.779 --> 01:36:04.779
shop.

01:36:04.779 --> 01:36:05.779
Really?

01:36:05.779 --> 01:36:09.279
I saw a gentleman passing, and I detected that he guessed that the magazine, I used that

01:36:09.279 --> 01:36:10.279
opportunity.

01:36:10.279 --> 01:36:12.279
You want to see what happened?

01:36:12.279 --> 01:36:21.399
Good.

01:36:21.399 --> 01:36:22.399
This will be a nice picture.

01:36:22.399 --> 01:36:23.399
Nice.

01:36:23.399 --> 01:36:24.640
Another one.

01:36:24.640 --> 01:36:26.640
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

01:36:26.640 --> 01:36:27.640
Good afternoon.

01:36:27.640 --> 01:36:34.630
Oh, you can see for your life, I can take a picture of you, if you like.

01:36:34.630 --> 01:36:35.630
Amazing.

01:36:35.630 --> 01:36:36.630
Thanks for that.

01:36:36.630 --> 01:36:52.800
Oh, what a nice picture.

01:36:52.800 --> 01:36:53.800
You are welcome.

01:36:53.800 --> 01:36:55.600
Thank you very much.

01:36:55.600 --> 01:36:59.640
By the way, have you pleased head of a government soon to come?

01:36:59.640 --> 01:37:01.039
That is free of corruption?

01:37:01.039 --> 01:37:03.479
No, I never heard about that.

01:37:03.479 --> 01:37:05.119
Oh, I have that.

01:37:05.119 --> 01:37:06.119
Look at this magazine.

01:37:06.119 --> 01:37:08.439
A government free of corruption.

01:37:08.439 --> 01:37:10.479
It features an article.

01:37:10.479 --> 01:37:16.359
And based on March 26, verses 9 and 10, where he says, taught us to pray for God's kingdom

01:37:16.359 --> 01:37:17.359
to come.

01:37:17.359 --> 01:37:19.119
Look at six points.

01:37:19.119 --> 01:37:24.359
That sets God's government clearly different from human rulership.

01:37:24.359 --> 01:37:32.600
Power, ruler, stability, the next page, laws, motifs, and subjects.

01:37:32.600 --> 01:37:37.199
I know you want to live in a society free of corruption, and you see the clear distinction

01:37:37.199 --> 01:37:40.199
between human rulership and God's government.

01:37:40.199 --> 01:37:41.199
So interesting.

01:37:41.199 --> 01:37:42.199
Very take it.

01:37:42.199 --> 01:37:46.640
I can see you are so much interested in the Bible discussion, and we want you to learn more

01:37:46.640 --> 01:37:48.359
about the Bible.

01:37:48.359 --> 01:37:54.680
This card will direct you to our website, JW.org, and you will have all your Bible questions

01:37:54.680 --> 01:37:55.680
answered.

01:37:55.680 --> 01:37:56.680
Thank you.

01:37:56.680 --> 01:37:57.680
Where are you from?

01:37:57.680 --> 01:37:58.680
We are from Ghana.

01:37:58.680 --> 01:37:59.680
Oh, Ghana.

01:37:59.680 --> 01:38:01.680
Yeah, we came here from the Bible school.

01:38:01.680 --> 01:38:02.680
Yes.

01:38:02.680 --> 01:38:03.680
Okay, Bible school?

01:38:03.680 --> 01:38:04.680
What school?

01:38:04.680 --> 01:38:05.680
Yes.

01:38:05.680 --> 01:38:06.680
It's five months course.

01:38:06.680 --> 01:38:07.680
Yes.

01:38:07.680 --> 01:38:13.399
To appreciate, understand, and apply the Bible in our lives, so we can also effectively teach

01:38:13.399 --> 01:38:14.399
other people.

01:38:14.399 --> 01:38:15.399
It's important.

01:38:15.399 --> 01:38:16.399
Yes.

01:38:16.399 --> 01:38:20.159
Is there any way we can get in contact with you so that this conversation can continue?

01:38:20.159 --> 01:38:21.159
Yeah, sure.

01:38:21.159 --> 01:38:22.159
I would like to.

01:38:22.159 --> 01:38:23.159
Can I give you my phone number?

01:38:23.159 --> 01:38:24.159
That would be excellent.

01:38:24.159 --> 01:38:25.159
Okay.

01:38:25.159 --> 01:38:26.159
This is my phone number.

01:38:26.159 --> 01:38:27.159
That's my name.

01:38:27.159 --> 01:38:28.159
David.

01:38:28.159 --> 01:38:29.159
Good.

01:38:29.159 --> 01:38:30.159
I'm Freeman Abe, and my wife is Miriam Agri.

01:38:30.159 --> 01:38:31.159
Okay.

01:38:31.159 --> 01:38:32.159
Okay.

01:38:32.159 --> 01:38:33.159
Good at any time.

01:38:33.159 --> 01:38:34.159
Thank you very much, David.

01:38:34.159 --> 01:38:35.159
Okay.

01:38:35.159 --> 01:38:37.359
You can't, or an evening or something?

01:38:37.359 --> 01:38:38.359
Even today.

01:38:38.359 --> 01:38:40.880
No, I'm going somewhere, but if you like, you can call me by 4 p.m.

01:38:40.880 --> 01:38:41.880
That would be excellent.

01:38:41.880 --> 01:38:42.880
David.

01:38:42.880 --> 01:38:43.880
Thank you very much.

01:38:43.880 --> 01:38:53.430
Thank you.

01:38:53.430 --> 01:38:54.430
But that's it, Freeman.

01:38:54.430 --> 01:38:55.430
That's it.

01:38:55.430 --> 01:38:57.189
You were alert and prepared, and you paid off.

01:38:57.189 --> 01:38:58.189
Yes.

01:38:58.189 --> 01:38:59.189
So, what's the progress of this call?

01:38:59.189 --> 01:39:04.270
Robert Nets, I called him that very evening, and we started studying the back of the magazine

01:39:04.270 --> 01:39:09.390
about reasons for living in the existence of a creator, and believe it, we are studying

01:39:09.390 --> 01:39:10.390
on phone.

01:39:10.390 --> 01:39:11.390
Really?

01:39:11.390 --> 01:39:12.390
That's amazing.

01:39:12.390 --> 01:39:13.390
That's amazing.

01:39:13.390 --> 01:39:15.470
That's the idea of being alert.

01:39:15.470 --> 01:39:19.829
It reminds me of an experience ahead with the sister from my congregation when I went

01:39:19.829 --> 01:39:21.350
with her to a return visit.

01:39:21.350 --> 01:39:22.350
Okay.

01:39:22.350 --> 01:39:23.350
It was during the week of Halloween.

01:39:23.350 --> 01:39:24.350
Would you like to see her?

01:39:24.350 --> 01:39:25.350
Turned out?

01:39:25.350 --> 01:39:26.350
Yes, please.

01:39:26.350 --> 01:39:36.470
Hello.

01:39:36.470 --> 01:39:37.470
Hello.

01:39:37.470 --> 01:39:38.470
Good morning.

01:39:38.470 --> 01:39:39.470
Good morning.

01:39:39.470 --> 01:39:41.310
I'm Sony, and this is my friend, Hugh.

01:39:41.310 --> 01:39:42.310
Nice to meet you.

01:39:42.310 --> 01:39:46.149
We spoke to your mother last week from the Bible, and she asked that we could come back

01:39:46.149 --> 01:39:47.989
and continue in our conversation.

01:39:47.989 --> 01:39:49.310
So we came to see her, please.

01:39:49.310 --> 01:39:50.310
Oh, yes.

01:39:50.310 --> 01:39:51.310
I remember that now.

01:39:51.310 --> 01:39:52.310
I'm sorry.

01:39:52.310 --> 01:39:53.310
I was sitting in at the moment.

01:39:53.310 --> 01:39:54.310
She went out to church.

01:39:54.310 --> 01:39:55.310
Okay.

01:39:55.310 --> 01:39:56.310
I see.

01:39:56.310 --> 01:39:57.310
Anywhere where she comes back.

01:39:57.310 --> 01:39:58.310
Could you please stay here?

01:39:58.310 --> 01:39:59.310
Yeah.

01:39:59.310 --> 01:40:00.310
No problem.

01:40:00.310 --> 01:40:01.310
Okay.

01:40:01.310 --> 01:40:02.310
Thank you very much.

01:40:02.310 --> 01:40:03.310
All right.

01:40:03.310 --> 01:40:04.310
Goodbye.

01:40:04.310 --> 01:40:05.310
Nice meeting you.

01:40:05.310 --> 01:40:06.310
Likewise.

01:40:06.310 --> 01:40:07.310
Before we leave, I would like to show you a short video.

01:40:07.310 --> 01:40:10.310
It's only three minutes long, and it has the title, Why Study the Bible?

01:40:10.310 --> 01:40:11.310
Yeah, sure.

01:40:11.310 --> 01:40:25.039
From the moment we can talk, we ask questions.

01:40:25.039 --> 01:40:26.039
So what do you think of it?

01:40:26.039 --> 01:40:27.039
Yeah.

01:40:27.039 --> 01:40:28.039
That was a pretty interesting video.

01:40:28.039 --> 01:40:32.560
As you can see, the Bible can help us find answers to questions we have in life.

01:40:32.560 --> 01:40:36.880
For example, this week I've noticed people around us celebrating Halloween.

01:40:36.880 --> 01:40:39.560
So it means they're thinking about their dead ones.

01:40:39.560 --> 01:40:46.399
Have you ever wondered what hope is there for our family members or friends or that?

01:40:46.399 --> 01:40:47.399
That's a good question.

01:40:47.399 --> 01:40:49.119
I'd like to know more about that.

01:40:49.119 --> 01:40:53.279
Well, you'd be very happy to know that the Bible gives an answer to that question.

01:40:53.279 --> 01:40:56.640
I have with me this brochure, Good News from God.

01:40:56.640 --> 01:41:01.800
When it's less than six, the title is what hope is there for the dead.

01:41:01.800 --> 01:41:08.079
So I'll be very happy to come next Saturday morning to check with you what the Bible gives

01:41:08.079 --> 01:41:09.640
as an answer to that question.

01:41:09.640 --> 01:41:10.640
Yeah, that would be great.

01:41:10.640 --> 01:41:11.640
Come.

01:41:11.640 --> 01:41:21.279
Thanks.

01:41:21.279 --> 01:41:23.760
Very, very quick thinking on your part, Hughes.

01:41:23.760 --> 01:41:27.319
The thing I liked is that even though the original householder wasn't there, you took advantage

01:41:27.319 --> 01:41:29.600
of the situation you were alert and prepared.

01:41:29.600 --> 01:41:30.600
Very nice.

01:41:30.600 --> 01:41:35.239
Yes, and you know, it turned out well because we studied the Bible study with him.

01:41:35.239 --> 01:41:36.239
It's amazing.

01:41:36.239 --> 01:41:40.520
After a few weeks, he gave me his phone number, which proved to be very helpful in this

01:41:40.520 --> 01:41:45.640
cold winter because some Saturdays, we could not go out because of the storm and I could

01:41:45.640 --> 01:41:47.520
conduct that study on the phone.

01:41:47.520 --> 01:41:52.159
It's amazing the number of studies that have been started or conducted here.

01:41:52.159 --> 01:41:55.239
And you know, Rachel had a similar experience with being alert.

01:41:55.239 --> 01:42:00.159
Yeah, I was working with a sister who has a magazine, who's with a lady.

01:42:00.159 --> 01:42:02.359
I would like to show you what happened.

01:42:02.359 --> 01:42:14.819
Please.

01:42:14.819 --> 01:42:15.819
How are you doing?

01:42:15.819 --> 01:42:16.819
Good.

01:42:16.819 --> 01:42:17.819
You are welcome.

01:42:17.819 --> 01:42:18.819
Oh, thank you.

01:42:18.819 --> 01:42:19.819
Today I'm with Rachel.

01:42:19.819 --> 01:42:20.819
Rachel?

01:42:20.819 --> 01:42:21.819
Christian.

01:42:21.819 --> 01:42:22.819
Nice to meet you.

01:42:22.819 --> 01:42:23.819
Rachel.

01:42:23.819 --> 01:42:24.819
Thank you.

01:42:24.819 --> 01:42:25.819
Thank you.

01:42:25.819 --> 01:42:31.220
You know, we have some new issues of magazine and this is about a government free of corruption

01:42:31.220 --> 01:42:33.220
and I'm sure you will enjoy it.

01:42:33.220 --> 01:42:34.220
Thank you so much.

01:42:34.220 --> 01:42:35.220
Okay.

01:42:35.220 --> 01:42:36.220
Thank you.

01:42:36.220 --> 01:42:37.220
Thank you.

01:42:37.220 --> 01:42:38.220
I really read it later.

01:42:38.220 --> 01:42:39.220
Okay.

01:42:39.220 --> 01:42:40.220
Have a nice day.

01:42:40.220 --> 01:42:41.220
Thank you.

01:42:41.220 --> 01:42:42.220
Bye.

01:42:42.220 --> 01:42:43.220
Bye.

01:42:43.220 --> 01:42:44.220
I can see that you really like your friends.

01:42:45.220 --> 01:42:47.220
Good friends warm the heart.

01:42:47.220 --> 01:42:48.220
I too.

01:42:48.220 --> 01:42:49.220
I too, Rachel.

01:42:49.220 --> 01:42:53.220
Do you know that these words are similar with what is written in the Bible?

01:42:53.220 --> 01:42:54.220
Really?

01:42:54.220 --> 01:42:55.220
Yes.

01:42:55.220 --> 01:42:56.220
Here.

01:42:56.220 --> 01:42:57.220
In 1217.

01:42:57.220 --> 01:42:58.220
17.

01:42:58.220 --> 01:43:05.220
It says, a true friend shows love at all times and he's the brother who is born for times

01:43:05.220 --> 01:43:07.220
of this way.

01:43:07.220 --> 01:43:08.220
Hmm.

01:43:08.220 --> 01:43:09.220
Rachel.

01:43:10.220 --> 01:43:15.220
You know, nowadays it is not easy to find good friends.

01:43:15.220 --> 01:43:17.220
People are no sincere.

01:43:17.220 --> 01:43:20.220
We don't know who you can really trust.

01:43:20.220 --> 01:43:21.220
That is true.

01:43:21.220 --> 01:43:24.220
You are absolutely right.

01:43:24.220 --> 01:43:29.220
The good thing is since the Bible speaks about two friends.

01:43:29.220 --> 01:43:34.220
That means you can still find some who are really true friends.

01:43:34.220 --> 01:43:42.220
But before that, why not ask ourselves how can I personally be such a true friend to others?

01:43:42.220 --> 01:43:43.220
Hmm.

01:43:43.220 --> 01:43:46.880
It is not easy, Rachel.

01:43:46.880 --> 01:43:50.880
Really, to become such only the Bible can help you.

01:43:50.880 --> 01:43:58.880
That's why when our men visit you again, not just limit yourself in taking matters, which is fine.

01:43:58.880 --> 01:44:02.880
But take a few times each week to really study the Bible with her.

01:44:02.880 --> 01:44:04.880
It will help you a lot.

01:44:07.640 --> 01:44:09.640
I would like to study the Bible.

01:44:09.640 --> 01:44:10.640
Oh, very nice.

01:44:10.640 --> 01:44:14.640
And I would like you to come to study with me.

01:44:14.640 --> 01:44:15.640
Okay.

01:44:15.640 --> 01:44:21.640
Is it possible for you to come on Wednesday and I would like to give you my phone number.

01:44:21.640 --> 01:44:23.640
Let me give you my phone number.

01:44:23.640 --> 01:44:24.640
Sure.

01:44:24.640 --> 01:44:25.640
Thank you so much.

01:44:25.640 --> 01:44:28.640
What about Wednesday, 4 p.m. or in the morning?

01:44:28.640 --> 01:44:30.640
It is okay in the afternoon.

01:44:30.640 --> 01:44:31.640
Okay.

01:44:31.640 --> 01:44:35.270
Good.

01:44:35.270 --> 01:44:36.270
That's my phone number.

01:44:36.270 --> 01:44:37.270
Thank you.

01:44:37.270 --> 01:44:38.270
Thank you so much.

01:44:38.270 --> 01:44:39.270
Thank you so much.

01:44:39.270 --> 01:44:40.270
You will see us on Wednesday.

01:44:40.270 --> 01:44:41.270
Thank you, Rachel.

01:44:41.270 --> 01:44:42.270
I'll see you.

01:44:42.270 --> 01:44:43.270
Bye.

01:44:43.270 --> 01:44:52.010
Bye-bye.

01:44:52.010 --> 01:44:53.010
Very good.

01:44:53.010 --> 01:44:55.010
You and your husband are quick thinkers.

01:44:55.010 --> 01:44:57.010
And you know what I've been at.

01:44:57.010 --> 01:45:03.010
The sister contacted me recently and she said the lady is studying the Bible with her.

01:45:03.010 --> 01:45:06.010
Even with the opposition of her sons.

01:45:06.010 --> 01:45:07.010
Huh.

01:45:07.010 --> 01:45:08.010
It's amazing.

01:45:08.010 --> 01:45:13.010
Several things I've learned from your students today and that is to be prepared, to be alert,

01:45:13.010 --> 01:45:17.010
to be persistent, and to speak the tongue of the heart as I speak and teach.

01:45:17.010 --> 01:45:18.010
Very nice.

01:45:18.010 --> 01:45:21.010
Talking about speaking, we need to get back to class.

01:45:21.010 --> 01:45:23.010
Thank you very much, Robinette.

01:45:23.010 --> 01:45:55.550
That part of our program was brought to us by the developers of JW Language.

01:45:55.550 --> 01:45:59.550
So we hope that encourages everyone to continue to use it.

01:45:59.550 --> 01:46:01.550
Well, thank you very much, Brother Burnett.

01:46:01.550 --> 01:46:05.550
That was a very interesting and encouraging part of our program.

01:46:05.550 --> 01:46:09.550
Now we're going to get to know some of the students a little better.

01:46:09.550 --> 01:46:14.550
Brother William Turner, who is a helper to the service committee of the governing body.

01:46:14.550 --> 01:46:18.550
I will take the lead in interviewing some of the students.

01:46:18.550 --> 01:46:40.189
And the theme is selected is keep contributing to the good news.

01:46:40.189 --> 01:46:43.189
And Philippians chapter one, verses three through five.

01:46:43.189 --> 01:46:50.189
The Apostle Paul was moved to give thanks to Jehovah for the brother and sisters in Philippa.

01:46:50.189 --> 01:46:53.189
For their contributions to the good news.

01:46:53.189 --> 01:47:00.189
Or as the footnote mentions for their furthering, the participation in furthering the good news.

01:47:00.189 --> 01:47:09.189
And to those of you here in this class of Gilead, we too are very thankful for your contributions that you have made in furthering the good news.

01:47:09.189 --> 01:47:16.189
And we're confident that as long as you continue, the Jehovah is going to bless your future efforts.

01:47:16.189 --> 01:47:20.189
And I highlight this, we have the opportunity to speak with four of our students,

01:47:20.189 --> 01:47:26.189
Sister Gwen Williams, Sister Rachel and Brother Hughes, Cabochua, and Brother Trent Edson.

01:47:26.189 --> 01:47:29.189
And let's just start with Brother and Sister Cabochua.

01:47:29.189 --> 01:47:32.189
Now you serve as couple family members in Congo.

01:47:32.189 --> 01:47:35.189
And Sister Cabochua, you serve as one of the compositors.

01:47:35.189 --> 01:47:38.189
Can you tell us a little bit as to what your work entails?

01:47:38.189 --> 01:47:42.189
Composition is between translation and printing.

01:47:42.189 --> 01:47:51.189
We make publications in the local languages look the same as the English publications with pictures and captions.

01:47:51.189 --> 01:47:53.189
Very nice, sounds like a nice assignment.

01:47:53.189 --> 01:47:59.189
Now you mentioned an experience that really highlighted why your work is so important to you. Can you share that with us?

01:47:59.189 --> 01:48:07.189
Yes, one secret overseer told us that in their territory there is a man who knows witnesses for many years.

01:48:07.189 --> 01:48:13.189
But refuses to study the Bible because he said God does not love them.

01:48:13.189 --> 01:48:19.189
If he does, why should they study the Bible using publications in another language?

01:48:19.189 --> 01:48:24.189
Now that the branch decided to translate some publication in that language,

01:48:24.189 --> 01:48:31.189
such as listen to God and live forever brochure upon receiving his uncopy domain explain.

01:48:31.189 --> 01:48:36.189
Now God has turned his attention to us so he's studying the Bible.

01:48:36.189 --> 01:48:41.189
Very nice, really highlights the impact of learning one's language and the mother tongue, doesn't it?

01:48:41.189 --> 01:48:43.189
Thank you for sharing that.

01:48:43.189 --> 01:48:48.189
Brother, you serve as the secretary to the branch committee.

01:48:48.189 --> 01:48:51.189
Can you tell us a little bit as to what your work entails?

01:48:51.189 --> 01:48:54.189
Well, in general, it's paperwork.

01:48:54.189 --> 01:49:05.189
But it also involves giving myself and my time to have these brothers of the branch committee have what they need to make appropriate decisions for the branch territory.

01:49:05.189 --> 01:49:14.189
And I remember that it has happened because of emergencies in the country such as unrest or legal issues.

01:49:14.189 --> 01:49:21.189
I had to work until late in the evening gathering the information they need to ask for direction from the governing body.

01:49:21.189 --> 01:49:27.189
So because of that, I can say that my assignment is mainly a same day service.

01:49:27.189 --> 01:49:34.189
Because if you wait until tomorrow, tomorrow will come with other emergencies and anxieties and the work we pile up.

01:49:34.189 --> 01:49:44.189
And apart from that, there is also a lot of interaction between our office and brothers and sisters who come for questions or personal concerns.

01:49:44.189 --> 01:49:51.189
So it gives me an opportunity to contribute to the good news by working for the joy of my brothers and sisters.

01:49:51.189 --> 01:49:58.189
Because happy Bethelites are productive ones and productive Bethelites are a blessing for the whole branch territory.

01:49:58.189 --> 01:50:03.189
Very true, very nice. And no doubt those happy Bethelites appreciate your same day service.

01:50:03.189 --> 01:50:05.189
Also appreciate your sacrifice.

01:50:05.189 --> 01:50:10.189
But that's a new serve as a Bethel family member in Australia.

01:50:10.189 --> 01:50:15.189
But perhaps you can tell us, what was it that made you want to apply for a Bethel service?

01:50:15.189 --> 01:50:19.189
I was originally pioneering maybe five or six years in my hometown.

01:50:19.189 --> 01:50:23.189
I was enjoying the ministry, my work was good, employment was good as well.

01:50:23.189 --> 01:50:25.189
I was very comfortable in what I was doing.

01:50:25.189 --> 01:50:28.189
That was probably the problem. I eventually felt a little bit too comfortable.

01:50:28.189 --> 01:50:30.189
Feller had to stretch myself a bit more.

01:50:30.189 --> 01:50:34.189
Very interesting. So now if we understand you were less and that means that you were serving Jehovah.

01:50:34.189 --> 01:50:38.189
You were doing quite well. You were already in full-time service.

01:50:38.189 --> 01:50:42.189
But yet you still felt that you could contribute more.

01:50:42.189 --> 01:50:44.189
He was. It was time to reach out.

01:50:44.189 --> 01:50:47.189
Very interesting. Do you feel that Jehovah blessed your efforts?

01:50:47.189 --> 01:50:50.189
Yeah, I've thoroughly enjoyed Bethel service.

01:50:50.189 --> 01:50:54.189
I've served in the Australian branch for the last 12 years, seven years in the laundry.

01:50:54.189 --> 01:50:57.189
The last five in the service department loved all of it.

01:50:57.189 --> 01:51:01.189
Very nice. And thank you also for the nice reminder for us.

01:51:01.189 --> 01:51:04.189
Not to become too comfortable in this system. Nice admonition.

01:51:04.189 --> 01:51:09.189
Assist Williams says, we've heard you are serving in Albania.

01:51:09.189 --> 01:51:13.189
You are at the Bethel there. You also feel missionary in Albania.

01:51:13.189 --> 01:51:15.189
We know your origin is from England.

01:51:15.189 --> 01:51:16.189
That's right.

01:51:16.189 --> 01:51:18.189
That's quite a move.

01:51:18.189 --> 01:51:22.189
So can you tell us what challenges you encountered by making such a move?

01:51:22.189 --> 01:51:27.189
Well, I first decided to move for a time to Albania to learn the language.

01:51:27.189 --> 01:51:30.189
Because in England I was finding it very difficult to learn it.

01:51:30.189 --> 01:51:33.189
The first congregation that I was in,

01:51:33.189 --> 01:51:36.189
there was just one family that spoke English.

01:51:36.189 --> 01:51:38.189
But they took me under their wing. They cared for me.

01:51:38.189 --> 01:51:44.189
But it still was very challenging trying to communicate with the brothers and sisters on the ministry.

01:51:44.189 --> 01:51:48.189
But also learning the culture and the customs in Albania.

01:51:48.189 --> 01:51:50.189
It took time. Very nice.

01:51:50.189 --> 01:51:55.189
And do you also feel that Jehovah has blessed your efforts for putting forth such an effort?

01:51:55.189 --> 01:52:00.189
Most definitely. After a year and a half I was invited to stay as a special pioneer.

01:52:00.189 --> 01:52:04.189
And I've had the most amazing 12 years there.

01:52:04.189 --> 01:52:09.189
The brothers and sisters are so warm and they've got such a zeal for the ministry.

01:52:09.189 --> 01:52:11.189
They just make you want to love them.

01:52:11.189 --> 01:52:13.189
And it's just been the most fantastic time.

01:52:13.189 --> 01:52:16.189
And there's still so much work to do there as well.

01:52:16.189 --> 01:52:19.189
Oh, that is fantastic. Thank you for sharing that with us.

01:52:19.189 --> 01:52:25.189
So clearly all of you have had various circumstances and situations in your special full-time service.

01:52:25.189 --> 01:52:29.189
And now you've received this wonderful invitation to come to Gilea.

01:52:29.189 --> 01:52:33.189
Now that you've completed the end of your Gilea training,

01:52:33.189 --> 01:52:38.189
what lessons have you learned that will now help you to keep contributing to the good news?

01:52:38.189 --> 01:52:40.189
Maybe we'll just start with you.

01:52:40.189 --> 01:52:43.189
Well, the lesson on faith really touched me.

01:52:43.189 --> 01:52:45.189
He brews 11 verse 4.

01:52:45.189 --> 01:52:47.189
We have the definition of faith.

01:52:47.189 --> 01:52:55.189
But we learned that faith is that total confidence or trust that Jehovah knows what's best for us.

01:52:55.189 --> 01:52:59.189
It's always in our best interest and it will result in our happiness.

01:52:59.189 --> 01:53:07.189
So at times when I really don't feel qualified or I don't know why I'm going to be doing a particular assignment,

01:53:07.189 --> 01:53:12.189
that's the time that I have to have faith in Jehovah that he'll help me.

01:53:12.189 --> 01:53:17.189
And through our study of the prophets, we learned that the prophets were just humble men.

01:53:17.189 --> 01:53:21.189
We had Amos, he was a herdsman, but Jehovah empowered him.

01:53:21.189 --> 01:53:26.189
There was Hosea, he had a really difficult assignment, but Jehovah helped him.

01:53:26.189 --> 01:53:32.189
Then there was Abraham, he just had that total confidence in Jehovah.

01:53:32.189 --> 01:53:39.189
And they accomplished wonderful things because it wasn't in their strength, but it was their faith in Jehovah.

01:53:39.189 --> 01:53:47.189
So those times that are going to come when I don't understand the whole picture or I don't feel that I'm really strong enough,

01:53:47.189 --> 01:53:54.189
that's going to be the perfect opportunity that I can demonstrate my total faith in Jehovah.

01:53:54.189 --> 01:54:02.189
And Gilead showed me that through studying these examples, I can dig deep and I can build up my confidence

01:54:02.189 --> 01:54:10.189
so that I can work along with Jehovah and his organization in my assignment today and whatever I must to do in the future.

01:54:10.189 --> 01:54:13.189
That's standing very nice about you sister.

01:54:13.189 --> 01:54:16.189
For me it was the lesson about prayer.

01:54:16.189 --> 01:54:24.189
In Mark 1.35, it says that Jesus went to an isolated place in order to pray.

01:54:24.189 --> 01:54:39.189
So Jesus acknowledged that a person need a private time for himself to think, to meditate, to examine himself deeply, to pray in order to have a personal contentment.

01:54:39.189 --> 01:54:50.189
Such an intimate time with Jehovah, where you pull out your heart to him and you examine yourself deeply, should be scheduled.

01:54:50.189 --> 01:55:01.189
So despite my busy program here, I do my best to have every day my intimacy time with Jehovah and I really love it.

01:55:01.189 --> 01:55:05.189
When I finish, I feel like I'm a new person.

01:55:05.189 --> 01:55:10.189
Doing this will help me, will keep me in peace with Jehovah.

01:55:10.189 --> 01:55:19.189
And whenever I am in peace with Jehovah, I will also be in peace with my brothers and sisters and that will contribute to the good news.

01:55:19.189 --> 01:55:22.189
Very nice. What a nice gym you've given us.

01:55:22.189 --> 01:55:27.189
Scheduled time to pray. It's a nice reminder. Thank you for that. How about you really ask?

01:55:27.189 --> 01:55:31.189
I think for me, it was learning where real joy comes from.

01:55:31.189 --> 01:55:42.189
Joy that's not fickle, that that can't be stolen away from me. And what we learned in class was that real joy comes from sensing and valuing Jehovah's approval.

01:55:42.189 --> 01:55:46.189
This scripture that really brought it home for me was Luke chapter 10 and verse 20.

01:55:46.189 --> 01:55:50.189
And this is where Jesus sent out the disciples. They've had an amazing day in the ministry.

01:55:50.189 --> 01:55:56.189
They come back to Jesus. They're so happy and they say even the demons were casting them out too.

01:55:56.189 --> 01:56:02.189
And Jesus says, well, that's okay. That's good. He says, but don't be happy about that.

01:56:02.189 --> 01:56:09.189
Be happy because your names have been inscribed in the heavens. You're saying, don't base all of your joy on these results that you're getting because those results will change.

01:56:09.189 --> 01:56:16.189
You won't always have that. Think about how your father feels about you because you're doing his work.

01:56:16.189 --> 01:56:23.189
That was a lesson for me that I needed to learn and it's made me resolve to base my joy in future.

01:56:23.189 --> 01:56:33.189
Not just on my work assignment or other circumstances that might change, but really from just dwelling on how Jehovah feels, how he's pleased if I just do what he asks of me.

01:56:33.189 --> 01:56:42.189
Very nice. Thank you. For me, it's stressed the importance of maintaining balance between my work and my brotherly love.

01:56:42.189 --> 01:56:49.189
Because as we reach the end of this system of things, Jehovah is speeding up his work as Isaiah 60, verse 22 says,

01:56:49.189 --> 01:57:00.189
so we have to expect to work more and more under pressure. And usually when we are under pressure among the first things we tend to sacrifice are our relationship with others.

01:57:00.189 --> 01:57:13.189
So Gilead is stressed in me that I should never let the devil weaken my love for my brothers and sisters and slow down the preaching of the good news.

01:57:13.189 --> 01:57:20.189
We considered for that example of King Saul, who spent his whole energy and time chasing after David.

01:57:20.189 --> 01:57:26.189
So he basically confused who the enemy was and meanwhile the Philistines got into the land.

01:57:26.189 --> 01:57:36.189
So it was a lesson for me to deepen my love for my brothers and sisters, focus on the qualities and reject any thoughts of self-importance.

01:57:36.189 --> 01:57:41.189
Very nice, very practical. So sound like you've all learned some fantastic lessons from Gilead.

01:57:41.189 --> 01:57:48.189
We heard about prayer, being able to strengthen our faith, improving in our joy and brotherly love.

01:57:48.189 --> 01:57:58.189
And we also appreciate the fact that you gave us scriptural references as well, because now you've given all of us something that we can meditate and think about. So we thank you for that.

01:57:58.189 --> 01:58:08.189
I want to last question, perhaps on a more intimate level, what would you say Gilead has done as far as your personal relationship with Jehovah?

01:58:08.189 --> 01:58:12.189
And perhaps brothers, just to convince why we can start with you with this question.

01:58:12.189 --> 01:58:20.189
Gilead helped me to see Jehovah as a real person and a close friend of mine.

01:58:20.189 --> 01:58:34.189
I see the true fullness of Psalm 139 verse 3, which says, you are familiar with all my ways. Only a father and a close friend can be such.

01:58:34.189 --> 01:58:37.189
So is Jehovah Tomina.

01:58:37.189 --> 01:58:46.189
And for me, it was really my intimacy time with Jehovah as a shepherd as Psalm 23 verse 5 shows.

01:58:46.189 --> 01:58:58.189
So I felt myself as a lamp in Jehovah's hands is examining me, seeing where I have any cuts and applies oil to prevent from any parasite.

01:58:58.189 --> 01:59:07.189
So I could see where I need to improve in my faith, in my patience, in my love for my brothers and sisters.

01:59:07.189 --> 01:59:13.189
Very nice. Since the Williams and brothers, and when this question came up, very interesting, both of you mentioned prayer.

01:59:13.189 --> 01:59:18.189
And then you took it in two different slides. So maybe I can you share your thoughts with us.

01:59:18.189 --> 01:59:24.189
Yes, we had a beautiful lesson on prayer and the question was asked, do you linger in prayer?

01:59:24.189 --> 01:59:30.189
I'm the type of person that in the beginning, I find it quite difficult to open up and express myself.

01:59:30.189 --> 01:59:33.189
So this lesson really touched me.

01:59:33.189 --> 01:59:41.189
It explained that the longer you talk to somebody, you become more relaxed and then you open up and you speak about things.

01:59:41.189 --> 01:59:50.189
At Psalm 62.8, it says that we need to pour out our heart to Jehovah, and that's something that takes time.

01:59:50.189 --> 01:59:57.189
So lingering in prayer with Jehovah, it's helped me to talk about everything that's happened during the day.

01:59:57.189 --> 02:00:05.189
And to see where I need to make changes, because it's helped me to understand what I think and really feel about certain issues.

02:00:05.189 --> 02:00:13.189
And I've talked with Jehovah even about things that I didn't actually want to mention, but now I know what I've got to work on.

02:00:13.189 --> 02:00:22.189
Jehovah wants me to succeed. He's like that friend that's trying to draw out things to get really to the bottom of the problem.

02:00:22.189 --> 02:00:31.189
He's helped his faithful ones in the past, and he wants to help me as well, and that's so warming, and it's brought me so much closer to Jehovah.

02:00:31.189 --> 02:00:34.189
Oh, beautiful. Thank you for sharing that.

02:00:34.189 --> 02:00:43.189
Before coming to Gilead, I really didn't know what it meant to supplicate Jehovah, to beg him for his help to really surrender to him in prayer.

02:00:43.189 --> 02:00:56.189
But as the Gilead course kept going, I began to see the enormity of things on the inside that I needed to change and also realize that in my own strength, I'd been unable to improve in these areas.

02:00:56.189 --> 02:01:08.189
For the first time, I started to realize that I needed to implore Jehovah for his Holy Spirit to help me try and shift some of these things, which I just couldn't do by myself.

02:01:08.189 --> 02:01:17.189
I've still got a long way to go with those things, but what I have learned is the power that fervent prayer to Jehovah has to bring me closer to him.

02:01:17.189 --> 02:01:26.189
Fantastic. Well, we have truly appreciated hearing from all of you, and we especially appreciate your beautiful heartfelt expressions.

02:01:26.189 --> 02:01:41.189
You know, it's interesting in verse 6 of Philippians chapter 1, Paul told those Christians that Jehovah started a good work in them, and after listening to all of your expressions, we are confident that Jehovah has indeed started a good work in you as well.

02:01:41.189 --> 02:01:54.840
And our prayer is that Jehovah continue to be with you, that he guides you, and that he blesses you, as you all continue to keep contributing to the good news.

02:01:54.840 --> 02:02:11.829
We'd like to thank you very much, Brother Turner, for those very meaningful interviews and the points that we gained from them.

02:02:11.829 --> 02:02:26.829
Well, now's another opportunity for us to stand and sing a song of praise to Jehovah, and a very nice song has been selected in harmony with the preaching work, song 141, searching for friends of peace.

02:02:26.829 --> 02:05:37.159
You can be seated again. What a beautiful song to encourage us to keep on going in that preaching work.

02:05:37.159 --> 02:05:48.159
When now we've come to a highlight of our program, the main talk that's going to be given, and we've privileged to have with us a member of the governing body by the Samuel Hood.

02:05:48.159 --> 02:06:09.840
He's going to talk to us on the theme, keep your eyes on Jehovah. Some may wonder, like the young man did just a few minutes ago, how can we keep our eyes on Jehovah when it's impossible for us to see him?

02:06:10.840 --> 02:06:18.840
Well, that last statement is true. It is impossible for mankind to look upon the creator, Jehovah.

02:06:18.840 --> 02:06:33.840
And we know that to be so, because of what Jehovah told Moses many years ago, he said in short, you cannot see my face, for no man can see me and live.

02:06:34.840 --> 02:06:46.840
So when we pray, we see no form. We can imagine a form of our God, Jehovah.

02:06:47.840 --> 02:07:04.840
So what do we do while we think in the terms of his magnificence and his marvelous qualities? And we can't number all of the fine qualities that are housed in the Jehovah God.

02:07:04.840 --> 02:07:14.840
So we are walking then by faith and not by sight. The human eye was not created to see God.

02:07:14.840 --> 02:07:28.840
We have no reason to believe that ever in the future, that humans would be able to look upon Jehovah God. He's just too glorious.

02:07:28.840 --> 02:07:41.840
But Jehovah created the human eye to behold many wonderful things. He wanted man to see the beauty that's all around him here on the planet Earth.

02:07:41.840 --> 02:07:53.840
To accomplish that, he formed the light. That's why the Bible says, let there be light, then there was light.

02:07:54.840 --> 02:08:24.279
Whatever obstructed the sun's rays from reaching the earth, God removed and brought about light. Light furnishes the many hues that delight the eyes of man, the beautiful green grass and green leaves, the variety of colorful birds, fish, vegetables, snow,

02:08:24.279 --> 02:08:48.029
snow, and all more snow, some say and few pray, no more snow, please today. Now snow is wonderful and we appreciate it very much.

02:08:48.029 --> 02:08:56.029
But being as frail as we are, sometimes we can get a little too much.

02:08:56.029 --> 02:09:08.029
But the question still lingers, how does mankind see Jehovah if not with the little eye? Well, it's with the eyes of the heart.

02:09:08.029 --> 02:09:16.029
That's what Paul said in his letter to the Ephesians, Ephesians chapter 1, in verse 18, the eyes of the heart.

02:09:17.029 --> 02:09:26.029
How do we see God, then, while we see God by coming to know Him and appreciating the fine qualities that belong to Him?

02:09:26.029 --> 02:09:41.029
You may recall Jesus' statement in his prayer before leaving the earth. He says, this means everlasting life. They're coming to know you, praying to his father, Jehovah.

02:09:41.029 --> 02:09:49.029
So that's one way that we're able to see God by coming into a knowledge of Him, coming to know Him.

02:09:49.029 --> 02:10:03.029
And as a result of your schooling, all of you here on the front rows, undoubtedly you know Him as never before.

02:10:03.029 --> 02:10:14.029
But not like you should know Him or not like you will know Him in the future.

02:10:15.029 --> 02:10:24.029
But today we must keep our eyes fixed on Jehovah to observe what he wants to be done in accomplishing his will.

02:10:24.029 --> 02:10:39.420
We rivet our eyes on Jehovah that way. Eyes of servants look to the hand of the master. So our eyes look to our God, Jehovah.

02:10:39.420 --> 02:10:50.760
Open your Bibles, please, to the 123rd Psalm, beautiful expressions here in the 123rd Psalm.

02:10:50.760 --> 02:10:58.039
First two verses, to you I raise my eyes, you who are informed in the heavens.

02:10:58.039 --> 02:11:07.039
As the eyes of servants look to the hand of their master and the eyes of a servant girl to the hand of her mistress.

02:11:08.039 --> 02:11:15.039
So our eyes look to Jehovah our God until he shows us favor.

02:11:15.039 --> 02:11:21.640
In whatever we're doing, we want Jehovah's blessing.

02:11:21.640 --> 02:11:28.640
We want to hear His well done. So we must look to Him for that blessing.

02:11:28.640 --> 02:11:33.640
And the Proverbs and interesting statement is made that we've read many, many times.

02:11:34.640 --> 02:11:39.640
He says, trust in Jehovah with all your heart and do not rely on your own understanding.

02:11:39.640 --> 02:11:43.640
But it's the next verse that we want to underscore here today.

02:11:43.640 --> 02:11:48.640
In all your ways, take notice of Him.

02:11:48.640 --> 02:11:53.640
And He will make your past straight, beautiful Proverbs 3.

02:11:53.640 --> 02:12:05.369
And we think back when Moses died, Joshua may have felt alone.

02:12:05.369 --> 02:12:08.619
But he wasn't alone.

02:12:08.619 --> 02:12:13.619
Jehovah assured him that he was with him.

02:12:13.619 --> 02:12:18.979
Look at Joshua 1.9, please.

02:12:18.979 --> 02:12:24.979
It says, have I not commanded you be courageous and strong?

02:12:24.979 --> 02:12:27.979
Do not be struck with terror or fear.

02:12:27.979 --> 02:12:36.319
For Jehovah your God is with you wherever you go.

02:12:36.319 --> 02:12:39.319
Now we don't know where all of you are going.

02:12:39.319 --> 02:12:42.319
But you know where you're going.

02:12:42.319 --> 02:12:45.319
A few of you will be going to a new place.

02:12:45.319 --> 02:12:47.319
Not many of you.

02:12:47.319 --> 02:12:53.850
Why? Well, your branch didn't want you to leave. That's why.

02:12:53.850 --> 02:12:55.850
So they said send them back.

02:12:55.850 --> 02:13:01.609
So we're going to send you back to the branch.

02:13:01.609 --> 02:13:12.319
But we must say this to you, wherever you go, you're not alone.

02:13:12.319 --> 02:13:15.319
Look for Jehovah and you will find him.

02:13:15.319 --> 02:13:17.319
He is not hiding.

02:13:17.319 --> 02:13:22.020
He will let himself be found by you.

02:13:22.020 --> 02:13:27.020
When I was preparing this talk, I thought that my little niece and nephew years ago,

02:13:27.020 --> 02:13:31.619
when I was a teenager, I had a great time with them.

02:13:31.619 --> 02:13:34.619
They were twins, a little boy, a little girl.

02:13:34.619 --> 02:13:40.619
And about the age of two, I would play hide and seek with them.

02:13:40.619 --> 02:13:44.960
Now I could hide from them and they'd never find me.

02:13:44.960 --> 02:13:47.960
They're just too little.

02:13:47.960 --> 02:13:53.779
But I always kept one leg out.

02:13:53.779 --> 02:13:56.779
Why? I wanted them to find me.

02:13:56.779 --> 02:14:00.779
Because it delighted their heart to find me.

02:14:00.779 --> 02:14:04.779
Well, Jehovah, in a sense, keeps one leg out.

02:14:04.779 --> 02:14:08.779
He wants us to find him. He's not going to hide from us.

02:14:08.779 --> 02:14:11.779
But like in hide and seek, we have to search.

02:14:11.779 --> 02:14:14.779
Those little children had to search for me.

02:14:14.779 --> 02:14:19.779
So we have to search for Jehovah, but he will let himself be found.

02:14:19.779 --> 02:14:21.779
How do we know that?

02:14:21.779 --> 02:14:25.779
Well, 1 Chronicles chapter 28, verse 9 tells us,

02:14:25.779 --> 02:14:31.779
if you search for him, he will let himself be found by you.

02:14:31.779 --> 02:14:35.779
And it's repeated again in 2 Chronicles 15, too.

02:14:35.779 --> 02:14:40.779
So we say, search for Jehovah in his written word, the Bible.

02:14:40.779 --> 02:14:47.729
Make it your aim to keep him well in view.

02:14:47.729 --> 02:14:51.729
Do not lose sight of God's words.

02:14:51.729 --> 02:14:53.729
His sayings.

02:14:53.729 --> 02:15:03.890
We can liken the Bible to an open window for us to see Jehovah

02:15:03.890 --> 02:15:06.890
and keep him in view.

02:15:06.890 --> 02:15:10.890
We open the pages of the Bible, we look right into heaven,

02:15:10.890 --> 02:15:15.890
right into the throne of God, many, many times.

02:15:15.890 --> 02:15:19.890
And we do not have to be in Daniel in order for that to happen.

02:15:19.890 --> 02:15:23.890
We can be in Matthew, we can be in Mark and Luke and Acts,

02:15:23.890 --> 02:15:26.890
and all the other pages of the Bible.

02:15:26.890 --> 02:15:32.890
Because God is there, Jehovah is present.

02:15:32.890 --> 02:15:37.890
And he wants us to see him by coming to know him.

02:15:37.890 --> 02:15:41.890
And what we see strithens our faith.

02:15:41.890 --> 02:15:46.239
And not only that, but it makes us happy.

02:15:46.239 --> 02:15:51.869
And that is a goal worth working for.

02:15:51.869 --> 02:15:53.869
To be happy.

02:15:53.869 --> 02:15:56.869
That's really what everyone on earth wants to be.

02:15:56.869 --> 02:15:58.869
They want to be happy.

02:15:58.869 --> 02:16:01.869
I've never met a man or a woman yet to tell me,

02:16:01.869 --> 02:16:06.239
I just love being said.

02:16:06.239 --> 02:16:12.239
No, all of us rejoice when something happens

02:16:12.239 --> 02:16:15.239
that creates happiness within us.

02:16:15.239 --> 02:16:19.239
And didn't Jesus make this interesting statement years ago?

02:16:19.239 --> 02:16:26.680
Happy are the eyes that see the things you are seeing.

02:16:26.680 --> 02:16:29.680
You're seeing so many things.

02:16:29.680 --> 02:16:32.680
We're seeing things today that our brothers and sisters

02:16:32.680 --> 02:16:34.680
in the years going by couldn't see.

02:16:34.680 --> 02:16:37.680
We have the broadcasting, beautiful arrangement,

02:16:37.680 --> 02:16:42.680
for us to see things that people in the past couldn't see.

02:16:42.680 --> 02:16:46.680
And as united as this, brought us closer together

02:16:46.680 --> 02:16:50.680
as a result of that broadcasting.

02:16:50.680 --> 02:16:53.680
Individuals tell us as members of the governing body,

02:16:53.680 --> 02:16:56.680
we would never feel so close to you.

02:16:56.680 --> 02:17:11.809
And they show up at taking so many pictures.

02:17:11.809 --> 02:17:19.399
We just feel as being persecuted for righteousness, say.

02:17:19.399 --> 02:17:23.870
We stand up there in green.

02:17:23.870 --> 02:17:28.469
When we look at Jesus, we are in a sense seen gone.

02:17:28.469 --> 02:17:30.469
In fact, Philip said to Jesus,

02:17:30.469 --> 02:17:34.469
Lord, show us the Father and it is enough for us.

02:17:34.469 --> 02:17:38.469
Jesus said to him, even after I have been with you men

02:17:38.469 --> 02:17:42.469
for such a long time, Philip, have you not come to know me?

02:17:42.469 --> 02:17:47.469
And then he says, whoever has seen me has seen the Father also.

02:17:47.469 --> 02:17:52.469
How is it you say, show us the Father?

02:17:52.469 --> 02:17:57.469
Now of course today we can't see Jesus either,

02:17:57.469 --> 02:18:00.469
as human here on the earth.

02:18:00.469 --> 02:18:03.469
He's a glorified spirit creature.

02:18:03.469 --> 02:18:08.469
And the Bible tells us that he dwells in unapproachable light.

02:18:08.469 --> 02:18:10.469
But we do benefit.

02:18:10.469 --> 02:18:15.469
We benefit from an afterglow

02:18:15.469 --> 02:18:18.469
when we zero in on his life and ministry

02:18:18.469 --> 02:18:21.469
as related in the gospels.

02:18:21.469 --> 02:18:23.469
What do we mean by an afterglow?

02:18:23.469 --> 02:18:28.469
Well, a lingering impression of his past brilliance.

02:18:28.469 --> 02:18:30.469
That flashes before us constantly.

02:18:30.469 --> 02:18:33.469
We open the pages of the Bible.

02:18:33.469 --> 02:18:36.469
So that's how we see Jesus.

02:18:36.469 --> 02:18:40.469
When we follow Jesus steps closely, where do they lead us?

02:18:40.469 --> 02:18:42.469
Why right out into the ministry?

02:18:42.469 --> 02:18:47.469
That's what Jesus did as a man here on the earth.

02:18:47.469 --> 02:18:51.809
And we are following his steps closely.

02:18:51.809 --> 02:18:56.809
We're dogging his steps as best we can,

02:18:56.809 --> 02:19:00.809
helping people find the road to life,

02:19:00.809 --> 02:19:04.809
assisting those who have found it to stay on it.

02:19:04.809 --> 02:19:07.809
That's a big job too.

02:19:07.809 --> 02:19:12.809
Jesus kept his eyes on Jehovah and copied what he saw.

02:19:15.670 --> 02:19:19.670
So we want to keep our eyes on Jesus, copy what we see.

02:19:19.670 --> 02:19:22.670
Try to mimic him.

02:19:22.670 --> 02:19:27.670
Be as much like the Christ as is possible for us this day

02:19:27.670 --> 02:19:33.000
in our imperfect state.

02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:36.000
Well, what did Jesus do with the spiritual food

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:38.000
his father had given him?

02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:45.000
He shared it with those who were spiritually hungry in his day.

02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:48.000
What do we do with the food that we receive?

02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:52.000
We share it with those who are hungry.

02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:55.000
Those who are conscious of their spiritual need,

02:19:55.000 --> 02:19:57.000
they want to be fed.

02:19:57.000 --> 02:19:59.000
So we share what we have within.

02:19:59.000 --> 02:20:01.000
And we have a lot.

02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:04.760
We have an abundance today.

02:20:04.760 --> 02:20:07.760
It just keeps rolling in.

02:20:07.760 --> 02:20:10.760
The governing body of the most of our time

02:20:10.760 --> 02:20:16.760
has spent reading what writing produces.

02:20:16.760 --> 02:20:18.760
What is it writing produces?

02:20:18.760 --> 02:20:20.760
Spiritual food.

02:20:20.760 --> 02:20:22.760
It just rolls in.

02:20:22.760 --> 02:20:26.760
Page after page after page.

02:20:26.760 --> 02:20:31.040
We spend a weekend reading.

02:20:31.040 --> 02:20:33.040
Well, that's the food.

02:20:33.040 --> 02:20:36.040
Jehovah's one pouring it out.

02:20:36.040 --> 02:20:39.040
We can't stop reading it and passing it on to the Brotherhood.

02:20:39.040 --> 02:20:41.040
It has to go out.

02:20:41.040 --> 02:20:43.040
It's food.

02:20:43.040 --> 02:20:47.040
So we just proper cells up.

02:20:47.040 --> 02:20:51.000
And read.

02:20:51.000 --> 02:20:54.000
And when we get tired of reading, we read some more.

02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:58.719
It just rolls in.

02:20:58.719 --> 02:21:00.719
Jehovah's prepared us for something.

02:21:00.719 --> 02:21:03.719
I think you know what it is.

02:21:03.719 --> 02:21:07.719
It's the end of this world and the bright new one.

02:21:07.719 --> 02:21:09.719
It's getting us ready.

02:21:09.719 --> 02:21:10.719
It's never before.

02:21:10.719 --> 02:21:12.719
Can't you sort of feel it?

02:21:12.719 --> 02:21:15.719
It's right on us, isn't it?

02:21:15.719 --> 02:21:21.719
And the Bible tells us we don't know the day of the hour.

02:21:21.719 --> 02:21:26.719
It's going to come suddenly when we least expect it.

02:21:26.719 --> 02:21:28.719
It's going to come.

02:21:28.719 --> 02:21:31.719
So you just keep expecting it and it won't come.

02:21:31.719 --> 02:21:38.639
But when we stop, when we least expect it, then here it is.

02:21:38.639 --> 02:21:41.639
What a day that would be.

02:21:41.639 --> 02:21:44.639
So feed the people in your territory.

02:21:44.639 --> 02:21:48.639
Share the truth, the spiritual food generously with the poor people

02:21:48.639 --> 02:21:52.639
caught up in Satan's system of things.

02:21:52.639 --> 02:21:57.639
The Bible tells us the generous person will be blessed

02:21:57.639 --> 02:22:00.639
for he shares his food with the poor.

02:22:00.639 --> 02:22:07.129
Share your food with the poor.

02:22:07.129 --> 02:22:10.129
Doesn't matter what they look like, where they live.

02:22:10.129 --> 02:22:12.129
It's the person not the place.

02:22:12.129 --> 02:22:14.129
It's the heart and not the face.

02:22:14.129 --> 02:22:18.889
God's message to all people we extend.

02:22:18.889 --> 02:22:20.889
I heard that somewhere.

02:22:20.889 --> 02:22:25.780
Beautiful song, isn't it?

02:22:25.780 --> 02:22:31.780
And when we get ready to play it, we just hear the friends kind of laugh.

02:22:31.780 --> 02:22:32.780
They're getting ready for it.

02:22:32.780 --> 02:22:35.780
They know that this is a little different than the normal.

02:22:35.780 --> 02:22:41.010
But it's good.

02:22:41.010 --> 02:22:45.010
When we look at Jehovah and Jesus, we see beautiful qualities.

02:22:45.010 --> 02:22:49.010
And one outstanding quality that we see is humility.

02:22:49.010 --> 02:22:53.090
It stands out.

02:22:53.090 --> 02:22:58.090
Jesus bent down, washed the feet of the prideful disciples of He is.

02:22:58.090 --> 02:23:00.090
Now why bring that up?

02:23:00.090 --> 02:23:04.090
Well, when you get to your assignments back home or elsewhere,

02:23:04.090 --> 02:23:06.090
display humility.

02:23:06.090 --> 02:23:14.649
We say, don't strut like a peacock displaying your beautiful feathers

02:23:14.649 --> 02:23:17.649
you have acquired here at Gilead School.

02:23:17.649 --> 02:23:24.219
Your brothers and sisters would see that the school has added

02:23:24.219 --> 02:23:30.219
to your humility if you show yourself to be humble.

02:23:30.219 --> 02:23:38.219
They'll see that the school has intensified the beauty attached to your humility.

02:23:38.219 --> 02:23:41.219
Your knowledge may have deepened a little while at school,

02:23:41.219 --> 02:23:45.219
but that is not the first thing that your brothers and sisters should see

02:23:45.219 --> 02:23:47.219
when you get back.

02:23:47.219 --> 02:23:53.850
You're not the only one who knows how to do things.

02:23:53.850 --> 02:23:59.850
So have confidence in your brothers and sisters ability to do things.

02:23:59.850 --> 02:24:03.850
Jehovah had confidence in his angels, didn't he?

02:24:03.850 --> 02:24:06.850
When he asked them, who will fool Ahad?

02:24:06.850 --> 02:24:09.850
One stood out, said, I'll fool him.

02:24:09.850 --> 02:24:11.850
Well, how are you going to fool him?

02:24:11.850 --> 02:24:13.850
This is what I'm going to do.

02:24:13.850 --> 02:24:14.850
We'll go do it.

02:24:14.850 --> 02:24:23.260
Now Jehovah could have fooled Ahad in the best way possible,

02:24:23.260 --> 02:24:26.260
but he didn't take that upon himself.

02:24:26.260 --> 02:24:32.260
He let somebody else of a lesser station do it.

02:24:32.260 --> 02:24:34.260
Can you do that when you get back home?

02:24:34.260 --> 02:24:39.260
Rather than always be out and front in the limelight,

02:24:39.260 --> 02:24:43.260
can you patch your brother on the back well done?

02:24:43.260 --> 02:24:48.260
There's more than one way of doing something.

02:24:48.260 --> 02:24:51.260
Let his way rule today.

02:24:51.260 --> 02:24:53.260
Here's a beat tomorrow.

02:24:53.260 --> 02:24:57.260
That's humility, and that's what we're talking about.

02:24:57.260 --> 02:25:00.260
In the days ahead, we may be surrounded by our enemies,

02:25:00.260 --> 02:25:03.260
and we don't know what to do.

02:25:03.260 --> 02:25:06.260
Well, thank you back to Gilead.

02:25:06.260 --> 02:25:09.260
Did Gilead give us a formula?

02:25:09.260 --> 02:25:16.260
What did brother Samuelson, Numer, Burnett, Kothon, Stovol say?

02:25:16.260 --> 02:25:21.010
I can't remember.

02:25:21.010 --> 02:25:24.010
Where do we turn our eyes?

02:25:24.010 --> 02:25:27.010
Well, they had a situation back years ago,

02:25:27.010 --> 02:25:30.010
2nd Chronicles chapter 20.

02:25:30.010 --> 02:25:33.010
Oh, our God, will you not execute judgment on them

02:25:33.010 --> 02:25:36.010
for we are powerless before this large crowd

02:25:36.010 --> 02:25:38.010
that is coming against us,

02:25:38.010 --> 02:25:41.010
and we do not know what we should do.

02:25:41.010 --> 02:25:43.010
Now notice the next line.

02:25:43.010 --> 02:25:45.010
This is 2nd Chronicles 2012.

02:25:45.010 --> 02:25:49.010
But our eyes are toward you.

02:25:49.010 --> 02:25:51.010
So turn your eyes towards Jehovah.

02:25:51.010 --> 02:25:54.010
If you run into a stalemate,

02:25:54.010 --> 02:25:57.010
you can't know whether to go to the left or to the right,

02:25:57.010 --> 02:25:59.010
straight ahead, back up,

02:25:59.010 --> 02:26:01.010
then turn your eyes, heaven,

02:26:01.010 --> 02:26:03.010
turn your eyes to Jehovah.

02:26:03.010 --> 02:26:04.010
Look up.

02:26:04.010 --> 02:26:06.010
Keep your eyes on Jehovah.

02:26:06.010 --> 02:26:08.010
Open your eyes wide.

02:26:08.010 --> 02:26:13.469
Don't squint.

02:26:13.469 --> 02:26:19.950
You're on the front line.

02:26:19.950 --> 02:26:21.950
Battling was Satan the devil.

02:26:21.950 --> 02:26:23.950
His ungodly system of things.

02:26:23.950 --> 02:26:28.950
Don't let the devil and this world shake your faith

02:26:28.950 --> 02:26:30.950
out of your minds and hearts.

02:26:30.950 --> 02:26:33.950
King David was tested by the devil

02:26:33.950 --> 02:26:35.950
by his own shortcomings

02:26:35.950 --> 02:26:36.950
and by the sins of others.

02:26:36.950 --> 02:26:38.950
But he never lost faith.

02:26:38.950 --> 02:26:39.950
Why?

02:26:39.950 --> 02:26:41.950
Well, let him tell you.

02:26:41.950 --> 02:26:45.950
He says, I keep Jehovah before me constantly

02:26:45.950 --> 02:26:48.950
because he is at my right hand.

02:26:48.950 --> 02:26:50.950
I will never be shaken.

02:26:50.950 --> 02:26:53.950
Beautiful Psalm 168.

02:26:53.950 --> 02:26:56.950
He had clear sharp vision.

02:26:56.950 --> 02:26:59.950
And I needed to walk safely

02:26:59.950 --> 02:27:01.950
through this dark and dismal world

02:27:01.950 --> 02:27:04.950
in these last days.

02:27:04.950 --> 02:27:07.950
Well, let's don't look at the things

02:27:07.950 --> 02:27:10.950
and God's word with a blank stare

02:27:10.950 --> 02:27:13.950
that is motionless.

02:27:13.950 --> 02:27:15.950
But see with the heart

02:27:15.950 --> 02:27:17.950
the things contained in the Bible.

02:27:17.950 --> 02:27:20.950
In fact, it's good to let the Bible

02:27:20.950 --> 02:27:25.389
serve as a flashlight

02:27:25.389 --> 02:27:29.389
beamed toward Jehovah.

02:27:29.389 --> 02:27:35.149
And to keep the switch turned on.

02:27:35.149 --> 02:27:36.149
Not off.

02:27:36.149 --> 02:27:40.799
And Jehovah will show you the way.

02:27:40.799 --> 02:27:42.799
Follow Jesus' example.

02:27:42.799 --> 02:27:44.799
Be generous with the truth that you have.

02:27:44.799 --> 02:27:47.799
Now, the school has taught you many fine things.

02:27:47.799 --> 02:27:50.799
Don't let them go to your head

02:27:50.799 --> 02:27:54.799
so as to make it swell with pride.

02:27:54.799 --> 02:27:56.799
Be the humble person.

02:27:56.799 --> 02:27:58.799
Your brothers expect you to be.

02:27:58.799 --> 02:28:01.799
You don't have to be a star.

02:28:01.799 --> 02:28:03.799
Just a fellow player on the team.

02:28:03.799 --> 02:28:05.799
Jesus is a star.

02:28:05.799 --> 02:28:07.799
Follow His moves.

02:28:07.799 --> 02:28:12.799
And you will always keep your eyes on Jehovah.

02:28:12.799 --> 02:28:39.540
Well, we'd like to thank you very much, Brother Hood,

02:28:39.540 --> 02:28:41.540
for that excellent talk.

02:28:42.540 --> 02:28:44.540
We may just like to mention, Brother Hood

02:28:44.540 --> 02:28:47.540
will not be available for photographs afterwards.

02:28:47.540 --> 02:28:51.239
The writing committee has just delivered

02:28:51.239 --> 02:28:54.239
insight one and two for him to check

02:28:54.239 --> 02:29:04.530
to see if any adjustments need to be made.

02:29:04.530 --> 02:29:07.530
Well, we certainly have had a rich

02:29:07.530 --> 02:29:09.530
spiritual program, haven't we?

02:29:09.530 --> 02:29:11.530
Something that we've all enjoyed.

02:29:11.530 --> 02:29:14.530
At this point, normally we give you a few statistics

02:29:14.530 --> 02:29:16.530
because we know there are those that always

02:29:16.530 --> 02:29:19.530
love to hear the statistics.

02:29:19.530 --> 02:29:22.530
So the total number of students in this class,

02:29:22.530 --> 02:29:26.530
the 138th class, 48,

02:29:26.530 --> 02:29:30.530
the number of married couples, 16,

02:29:30.530 --> 02:29:35.530
the number of single brothers, 12,

02:29:35.530 --> 02:29:40.530
the number of single sisters, 4,

02:29:40.530 --> 02:29:43.530
and you may like to note that prior to this class,

02:29:43.530 --> 02:29:46.530
the last single sister to attend Gilead

02:29:46.530 --> 02:29:49.530
was in the 83rd class of Gilead,

02:29:49.530 --> 02:29:53.530
and she graduated on September 6, 1987,

02:29:53.530 --> 02:29:55.530
almost 28 years ago.

02:29:55.530 --> 02:29:57.530
So I'm very happy to have some single sisters

02:29:57.530 --> 02:29:59.530
with us here in Gilead.

02:29:59.530 --> 02:30:13.290
The average age, 40.3 years,

02:30:13.290 --> 02:30:16.290
average years, baptised 24 years,

02:30:16.290 --> 02:30:19.290
and the average years in full-time service,

02:30:19.290 --> 02:30:22.290
19.5 or 19.5 years.

02:30:22.290 --> 02:30:25.290
So this class of Gilead,

02:30:25.290 --> 02:30:28.290
certainly already has had a lot of experience,

02:30:28.290 --> 02:30:30.290
and they've brought that experience with them

02:30:30.290 --> 02:30:33.290
and has gained a lot since.

02:30:33.290 --> 02:30:35.290
We have some greetings.

02:30:35.290 --> 02:30:38.290
There are so many branches that have written in

02:30:38.290 --> 02:30:39.290
with their greetings we've done.

02:30:39.290 --> 02:30:43.290
We couldn't possibly read all of what they've said.

02:30:43.290 --> 02:30:45.290
There are some branches perhaps that haven't

02:30:45.290 --> 02:30:47.290
sent in greetings and their students.

02:30:47.290 --> 02:30:49.290
Don't be discouraged students.

02:30:49.290 --> 02:30:51.290
They're waiting to see you when you get back home,

02:30:51.290 --> 02:30:54.290
and then they'll tell you how much they love you.

02:30:55.290 --> 02:30:57.290
So just to list some of the countries

02:30:57.290 --> 02:31:00.290
that have sent in these greetings, Angola,

02:31:00.290 --> 02:31:02.290
and they mention how happy they are

02:31:02.290 --> 02:31:04.290
that for the second time in their history,

02:31:04.290 --> 02:31:08.290
they have a student attending the Gilead school.

02:31:08.290 --> 02:31:13.290
Benin, Britain, Bolivia, Brazil,

02:31:13.290 --> 02:31:19.290
and Brazil mentions after a drought of almost 50 years,

02:31:19.290 --> 02:31:22.290
and they're not talking about rain.

02:31:22.290 --> 02:31:25.290
We've had the privilege of sending a second couple

02:31:25.290 --> 02:31:27.290
in less than a year.

02:31:27.290 --> 02:31:30.290
I think they're trying to tell us something.

02:31:30.290 --> 02:31:33.290
But they also mentioned that last service year,

02:31:33.290 --> 02:31:37.290
they had 29,870 baptized,

02:31:37.290 --> 02:31:40.290
and they're attendance at the memorial,

02:31:40.290 --> 02:31:44.290
1,728,208.

02:31:44.290 --> 02:31:46.290
That's quite outstanding.

02:31:46.290 --> 02:31:49.290
Bulgaria sends their love as those Burundi,

02:31:49.290 --> 02:31:55.290
Cameroon, France, Georgia, Haiti, Kazakhstan,

02:31:55.290 --> 02:32:02.290
Liberia, Macedonia, Madagascar, Myanmar, Nigeria,

02:32:02.290 --> 02:32:05.290
Russia sends their love, and they mentioned just

02:32:05.290 --> 02:32:08.290
in January 2015 alone,

02:32:08.290 --> 02:32:11.290
over 10 million pieces of literature

02:32:11.290 --> 02:32:13.290
were distributed throughout Russia,

02:32:13.290 --> 02:32:16.290
and there's been a 5% increase in the number of publishers.

02:32:16.290 --> 02:32:18.290
Isn't that wonderful to hear?

02:32:18.290 --> 02:32:28.909
And also, we have greetings from Ukraine.

02:32:28.909 --> 02:32:31.909
Isn't it nice to know we're part of a global brotherhood

02:32:31.909 --> 02:32:34.909
that our brothers in all these different countries

02:32:34.909 --> 02:32:36.909
are thinking not only about this class of Gilead,

02:32:36.909 --> 02:32:39.909
but about us here at the graduation?

02:32:39.909 --> 02:32:45.370
Well, we've seen some of the students,

02:32:45.370 --> 02:32:47.370
but now it's the opportunity to introduce

02:32:47.370 --> 02:32:56.180
to you the 138th class of Gilead.

02:32:56.180 --> 02:32:58.180
Now, for any chairman on the program,

02:32:58.180 --> 02:33:01.180
this is the most dangerous part of the assignment,

02:33:01.180 --> 02:33:04.180
because the chances are we'll get the assignments

02:33:04.180 --> 02:33:07.180
mixed up with the names and so on.

02:33:07.180 --> 02:33:09.180
So that's why I'm so happy to have brother David Schaefer here

02:33:09.180 --> 02:33:12.180
with us, is a helper to the teaching committee,

02:33:12.180 --> 02:33:16.180
and he's going to announce the names and the assignment,

02:33:16.180 --> 02:33:19.180
and then I'll pass on the diplomas.

02:33:19.180 --> 02:33:22.180
So David, let's hope you get it right.

02:33:22.180 --> 02:33:25.180
Please, if you'd start.

02:33:25.180 --> 02:33:28.180
And first, we have brother and sister Abbey,

02:33:28.180 --> 02:33:38.600
and they'll be returning to Ghana.

02:33:38.600 --> 02:33:46.790
Brother Acebes will be returning to the Philippines.

02:33:46.790 --> 02:33:47.790
Very good.

02:33:47.790 --> 02:33:49.790
We have brother and sister Davies,

02:33:49.790 --> 02:33:59.079
and they're returning to Australia.

02:33:59.079 --> 02:34:01.079
And here we have brother Edson,

02:34:01.079 --> 02:34:03.079
and he's returning to Australia.

Here we have brother Fomine,

02:34:10.719 --> 02:34:12.719
and he's returning to Russia.

02:34:12.719 --> 02:34:22.399
And here we have brother François,

02:34:22.399 --> 02:34:29.879
and he's returning to Haiti.

02:34:29.879 --> 02:34:31.879
Here we have brother Shoaneli,

02:34:31.879 --> 02:34:41.049
and he's returning to Argentina.

02:34:41.049 --> 02:34:45.049
Brother and sister Hollis will be serving in Ukraine.

02:34:45.049 --> 02:34:55.360
Brother Yavanovich will be returning to Macedonia.

02:34:55.360 --> 02:35:09.629
Brother and sister Gabychoa will be returning to Congo.

02:35:09.629 --> 02:35:19.200
Brother Kim will be serving in South Korea.

02:35:19.200 --> 02:35:28.319
Brother Kucho di Enko will be serving in Ukraine.

02:35:28.319 --> 02:35:31.319
Brother and sister Lee will be returning to Britain.

Brother and sister Nying will be returning to Myanmar.

02:35:49.680 --> 02:35:59.219
Brother and sister Namba will be serving in Asia.

02:35:59.219 --> 02:36:09.010
Brother and sister Niel will be returning to Liberia.

02:36:09.010 --> 02:36:18.739
Brother Nwagu will be returning to Nigeria.

02:36:18.739 --> 02:36:26.729
Sister Razook will be returning to Lebanon.

02:36:26.729 --> 02:36:35.500
Brother and sister Hodoriges will be returning to Brazil.

02:36:35.500 --> 02:36:48.120
Brother Sehulia will be returning to Central African Republic.

02:36:48.120 --> 02:36:57.239
Brother Soba will be returning to Papua New Guinea.

02:36:57.239 --> 02:37:04.649
Brother Sona will be returning to Angola.

02:37:04.649 --> 02:37:13.579
Sister Fan Lovidan will be returning to Bulgaria.

02:37:13.579 --> 02:37:16.579
Sister Williams will be returning to Albania.

02:37:16.579 --> 02:37:24.959
And brother and sister Woru will be returning to Benin.

02:37:24.959 --> 02:37:37.010
Well, at this point we're going to ask for the dial clock to read a class letter for us.

02:37:37.010 --> 02:37:52.870
To the governing body and the United States Bethel family, dear brothers.

02:37:52.870 --> 02:38:00.870
From the moment we walked into your home, you opened your arms wide and embraced us into your family.

02:38:00.870 --> 02:38:10.870
Your smiles, personal interest, and the many loving gestures have been proof of your spirituality and deep love.

02:38:11.870 --> 02:38:16.870
You have cared for all our needs and have done so much to assist us in practical ways.

02:38:16.870 --> 02:38:24.870
We cannot express how this helped us settle our nerves, gave us strength, and warmed our hearts.

02:38:24.870 --> 02:38:29.870
You're doing so enabled us to concentrate on our journey through God's Word.

02:38:29.870 --> 02:38:36.870
We wish to especially thank our dear brothers and the governing body for allowing the opportunity for single brothers and sisters,

02:38:36.870 --> 02:38:42.870
along with married couples, to benefit from this rich theocratic training.

02:38:42.870 --> 02:38:50.870
The variety of backgrounds and circumstances of our fellow classmates has enriched our learning experience.

02:38:50.870 --> 02:38:55.870
Your heartfelt talks have opened up our eyes to the deeper things of God's Word.

02:38:55.870 --> 02:39:00.870
An example of you and your wives has taught us so much.

02:39:00.870 --> 02:39:05.870
You give of yourselves tirelessly with such a joyful spirit.

02:39:05.870 --> 02:39:11.309
It is our desire to keep imitating the spirit you show.

02:39:11.309 --> 02:39:18.309
We appreciate it that our instructors have shown the same spirit as Paul, who in writing to the Thessalonians said,

02:39:18.309 --> 02:39:29.309
we were determined to impart to you not only the good news of God, but also our very selves because you became beloved to us.

02:39:29.309 --> 02:39:38.309
Your personal interest in each student, as well as your giving spirit, have provided us with a beautiful example to follow.

02:39:38.309 --> 02:39:42.309
You have skillfully done your part.

02:39:42.309 --> 02:39:45.309
Now it is time for us to do ours.

02:39:45.309 --> 02:39:50.309
We recognize that the one who deserves all our praise and gratitude is Jehovah.

02:39:50.309 --> 02:39:58.309
During the past 20 weeks, he has become even more real and dear to each of us as our love for him has deepened.

02:39:58.309 --> 02:40:02.309
It is now our resolve to keep building on this.

02:40:02.309 --> 02:40:10.309
We deem it an honor to serve the most high along with you, with heartfelt love, the 130th class of Gilead.

02:40:10.309 --> 02:40:20.899
We certainly appreciated that very meaningful letter.

02:40:20.899 --> 02:40:28.899
Well, it's my privilege now to speak to you as a first person, speaking to you as graduates of the 138th class.

02:40:28.899 --> 02:40:35.899
And just finally, what we'd like to remind you about are the words that we mentioned in the beginning of our program.

02:40:35.899 --> 02:40:45.899
Remember, we discussed 2nd Timothy, chapter 2, about the need to entrust this information to other faithful persons,

02:40:45.899 --> 02:40:50.899
whether your brothers or sisters, you have that opportunity to be able to help them.

02:40:50.899 --> 02:40:59.899
And I thought we might just take our bibles. I know you haven't got yours there, so you can just sit back and listen to this final part.

02:40:59.899 --> 02:41:08.899
But if we look at 2nd Timothy again, we see a couple of things that help us with regard to the application of what Paul said to Timothy.

02:41:08.899 --> 02:41:14.899
So reading again, verse 2, it said, the things you heard from me that were supported by many witnesses,

02:41:14.899 --> 02:41:22.899
these things in trust to faithful men, who in turn will be adequately qualified to teach others.

02:41:22.899 --> 02:41:28.899
Well, what did Paul have in mind and what does the governing body have in mind for you as well?

02:41:28.899 --> 02:41:36.899
Well, in the same chapter in verse 14, he says, keep reminding them of these things.

02:41:36.899 --> 02:41:49.899
So part of your work isn't necessarily for you to astound the brothers and sisters with all sorts of new, mysterious, wonderful things that you may have heard while you've been here a gillian.

02:41:49.899 --> 02:41:53.899
Shock tactics are not mentioned here in this verse.

02:41:53.899 --> 02:42:00.899
So a lot of what you will be doing will be just reminding the brothers of things that they've already heard.

02:42:00.899 --> 02:42:09.899
Then it goes on to say instructing them, or as the footnote says, bearing thorough witness to them before God.

02:42:09.899 --> 02:42:17.899
Then it goes on to say not to fight about words, something of no usefulness at all, because it harms those listening.

02:42:17.899 --> 02:42:25.899
So don't get sidetracked with pedantics, all the little details, just encourage the brothers.

02:42:25.899 --> 02:42:28.899
And encourage them by means of your example.

02:42:28.899 --> 02:42:36.899
Sometimes it may be easy and you may be tempted to say, or in gillian we learnt this, or in gillian we learnt.

02:42:36.899 --> 02:42:42.899
After a little while, if you say that a number of times, you know what the brothers will be thinking?

02:42:42.899 --> 02:42:46.899
If they say that one more time.

02:42:46.899 --> 02:42:53.899
And the point is, for the brothers it could be a little discouraging because they can't come to gillian.

02:42:53.899 --> 02:42:55.899
They probably will never come to gillian.

02:42:55.899 --> 02:43:01.899
And it seems now that they're relying on you as the only contact with gillian to enlighten them.

02:43:01.899 --> 02:43:12.899
How much better to go to God's Word, to go to the Watchtower Library, to go to things that have already been published, and share those things with the brothers.

02:43:12.899 --> 02:43:18.899
And then the focus is not on you as an individual, but rather on Jehovah and his organisation.

02:43:18.899 --> 02:43:20.899
And then that way they can be strengthened.

02:43:20.899 --> 02:43:26.899
But most of all, make sure you set an excellent example for them to follow.

02:43:26.899 --> 02:43:39.899
And that's what verse 15 says, do your utmost to present yourself a proof to God, a workman with nothing to be ashamed of, handling the Word of the Truth.

02:43:39.899 --> 02:43:43.899
Well, it's our confidence that you will do that.

02:43:43.899 --> 02:43:52.899
The instructors here at Gillian have been willing to entrust to you these wonderful things that have been passed on to them.

02:43:52.899 --> 02:44:00.899
So as you go to your assignments, whether you're returning home or going to a new assignment, we wish you Jehovah's blessing.

02:44:00.899 --> 02:44:07.899
And may you keep in mind the need to entrust these sayings and teachings to other faithful ones.

02:44:07.899 --> 02:44:17.500
Well, to conclude our program, we have the attendance figures.

02:44:17.500 --> 02:44:25.500
And you may like to take a note of these. Canada tells us they had 494 attendance.

02:44:25.500 --> 02:44:30.500
The United States, if we break it up into the various facilities.

02:44:30.500 --> 02:44:40.500
Patterson, here in Patterson we had 3,708 in Brooklyn, 3,302.

02:44:40.500 --> 02:44:44.500
Wal-Kill had 2,761.

02:44:44.500 --> 02:44:48.500
Wal-Wick had 2,249.

02:44:48.500 --> 02:44:52.500
Florida for Lauderdale, 105.

02:44:52.500 --> 02:44:56.500
Florida Palm Coast, 201.

02:44:56.500 --> 02:45:00.500
The Newberg Assembly Hall, 1,210.

02:45:00.500 --> 02:45:03.500
Jamaica, 76.

02:45:03.500 --> 02:45:06.500
Puerto Rico, 100.

02:45:06.500 --> 02:45:12.500
It makes a total for the United States branch territory of 13,712.

02:45:12.500 --> 02:45:16.500
The grand total, 14,206.

02:45:16.500 --> 02:45:20.500
That's 1,900 more than last time.

02:45:20.500 --> 02:45:38.959
Well, it's certainly our wish and desire that Jehovah will bless these graduates of the 138th class

02:45:38.959 --> 02:45:41.959
and that they will continue to stand firm.

02:45:41.959 --> 02:45:47.959
And it's appropriate that we conclude by seeing, song 139,

02:45:47.959 --> 02:45:49.959
teach them to stand firm.

02:45:49.959 --> 02:45:53.959
At the conclusion of the song, brother William Malafond,

02:45:53.959 --> 02:46:00.959
who's a teacher for many years with SIA helper for many years to the teaching committee,

02:46:00.959 --> 02:46:02.959
will offer the final prayer.

02:46:02.959 --> 02:46:04.959
So song 139.
