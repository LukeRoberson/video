00:00:10.449 --> 00:00:19.449
The rest of it, he makes into a God, he worships it.

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:28.949
He prays to it and says, save me, for you are my God.

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.949
That's not right.

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:34.950
If we're going to worship Jehovah, then we need to go to the temple.

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:35.950
Grandfather said that.

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:37.950
Never mind what your grandfather said.

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.950
You can be loyal to Jehovah and to Bel, or any other God at the same time.

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.950
When the king does not search for Jehovah, everyone suffers.

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:51.950
What if you're wrong? What if Bel worship is important?

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.950
I want to finish the cleansing work my grandfather started.

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:57.950
It's my brother down as easily as they think.

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:08.780
He's endangering himself, his family, and our entire nation.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.780
Jehovah have I gone too far.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.780
What if just I was right? Right about what?

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.780
What if there really is only one Jehovah?

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:31.579
Long it takes.
