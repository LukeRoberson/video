00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:08.039
From the beginning, Jehovah has always cared about people.

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:13.619
Sadly, many of them have caused him great pain,

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:28.769
but some have made him very happy.

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:52.090
Jesus always made Jehovah happy.

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.689
Satan didn't like this.

00:00:54.689 --> 00:00:59.390
He tried everything to get Jesus to do what was wrong.

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.590
If you are a son of God,

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.390
tell these stones to become loves of bread.

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.890
It is written, man must not live on bread alone.

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:33.450
If you are a son of God, throw yourself down.

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.150
For the angels will carry you on their hands.

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:43.930
So you may not strike your foot against the stone.

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.859
Prove it to them.

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:48.659
Again, it is written,

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:59.560
you must not put you over your God to the test.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:07.930
See all this glory.

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.330
It is mine,

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.460
and I give it to whoever I wish.

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:18.120
And all these things,

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:26.849
if you fall down and do an act of worship to me.

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:28.849
Go away, Satan.

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:30.150
For it is written,

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.650
it is Jehovah your God, you must worship.

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.150
And it is to him alone,

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:39.289
you must render sacred service.

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:43.389
Jesus was determined to make Jehovah happy.

00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:46.090
But this story isn't over.

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:47.990
This is your story, too.

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:51.150
Do you mean that?

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:57.639
Well, what you do can make Jehovah happy.

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:01.639
Our text this morning, Proverbs 27-11.

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:03.439
Do you remember what that says?

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:04.439
Oh, yeah.

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:05.340
It says,

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.639
be wise my son and make my heart rejoice.

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:11.039
Good memory is of you.

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:13.939
That scripture is talking about you.

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:16.139
What you do every day,

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:17.939
not only big things,

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:19.939
but also small things you do

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:42.590
can make his heart rejoice.

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:45.490
Remember today's text, children.

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:50.169
I know you'll make Jehovah happy.

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:51.169
Let's pray.

00:03:51.169 --> 00:04:00.250
Okay, kids.

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:01.849
It's a pop quiz today.

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:06.180
Yes.

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:07.379
Now, Sophia,

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:08.979
if you ace this test,

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:10.979
you'll be number one in the whole class.

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:58.930
Number one in the whole class.

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:00.129
Hey, Caleb.

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:03.699
You want to play?

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:09.300
It's fun.

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.800
Get it.

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.100
He's a loser.

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.600
Let me play with it.

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.300
Are you going to play or not?

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:43.120
You're going to play?
