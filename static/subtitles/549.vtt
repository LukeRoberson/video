00:00:01.649 --> 00:00:08.529
Now, let us consider the question, how does Jehovah care for those who are humble?

00:00:08.529 --> 00:00:14.769
Now, humility is a quality that is part of our figurative heart, and just like other

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:24.210
qualities of the heart like kindness, mildness, patience, humility is a quality that we cannot

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.649
see.

00:00:26.649 --> 00:00:32.289
And so, have you ever said about a brother or sister in your congregation or hear that

00:00:32.289 --> 00:00:33.689
battle?

00:00:33.689 --> 00:00:38.890
That brother or that sister is so humble.

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:46.329
Now what made you say that did you see a little cloud filled with humility, hovering

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:48.009
above the brother or sister?

00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:53.130
No, but you must have seen something that made you conclude that a brother or sister

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:54.130
is humble.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.090
What was that something?

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:05.170
Now to answer, think of this comparison, imagine you walk into a store and you see a display

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.730
of boxes with chocolate.

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:14.370
The boxes look nice, but you wonder, what's the quality of the chocolates?

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:19.730
Then a store clerk gives you a chocolate as a sample.

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:21.049
You taste it?

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:22.930
That's good.

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.250
Now you know what is in the box.

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.890
So what's the lesson of this little story?

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:37.489
Well, just like tasting a sample chocolate reveals the quality of the chocolate in the

00:01:37.489 --> 00:01:48.049
box, so seeing an act of humility reveals the depth of humility in someone's heart.

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:56.329
After all, if we don't prove by words or by actions our humility, no one will know that

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:58.209
we have it.

00:01:58.209 --> 00:02:07.489
So when do we have opportunities to give out samples so to speak of our humility?

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:14.129
Now the Watchtower article that is the source of today's comments mentions three situations

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:19.210
that may test the depth and January nurse of our humility.

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:27.330
The three situations are when we receive counsel, when others receive privileges of surface,

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:33.169
or when we receive, when we face new circumstances.

00:02:33.169 --> 00:02:38.449
Now today's comments focus on the third situation.

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:43.129
They focus on the changes of assignments that have been received by a good number of

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:48.490
traveling overseers and their wives, better lights, brothers and sisters in other forms

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:55.610
of full-time service as well as by coordinators of the body of elders.

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:02.449
Now why can we say that these brothers and sisters offered a beautiful sample of their

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:08.650
humility by accepting their changes of assignment?

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.330
To answer, note this quote from the Watchtower comments.

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:18.689
Such adjustments were not easy for these brothers and sisters to make.

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:24.569
Obviously they felt attached to their former assignments in many cases, one that they had

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:27.370
cherished for years.

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:35.370
Some went through a grieving process as they adjusted to their new circumstances.

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.530
A grieving process.

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:44.330
The Watchtower does not often use that expression, but in the case of those who were asked to

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:51.569
give up an assignment that they dearly loved, it is a proper expression to use.

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:57.849
Though facing new circumstances was difficult, these brothers and sisters who used to serve

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:04.449
at battle in the traveling work accepted the change with humility.

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:07.969
Now how did Jehovah help them?

00:04:07.969 --> 00:04:15.009
Now we find an answer that Isaiah 57 verse 15, which is the text for today.

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:18.970
Now in the beginning of the verse, Isaiah is speaking.

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:28.170
He says about Jehovah, for this is what the high and lofty one says, who lives forever and

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:30.930
whose name is Jehovah.

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:34.410
Now then Jehovah begins to speak.

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:40.449
He confirms what Isaiah said, but adds a surprising thought to what Jehovah says.

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:51.930
I reside in the high and holy place, but also with those crust and lowly in spirit.

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.970
Now let's pause here for a moment.

00:04:54.970 --> 00:05:00.370
One Bible reference work says that if you reside or dwell mentioned in the beginning of

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:06.889
the sentence is implied in the second part of the sentence, so we could read the sentence

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:08.810
as follows.

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:18.490
I reside in the high and holy place, but I also reside with those crust and lowly in spirit.

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:22.170
Now think about this statement made by Jehovah.

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:26.290
Is it not amazing and heartwarming?

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:30.050
Note the combination of qualities that he expresses.

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:35.410
He is high and holy, but also nearby and humble.

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:43.329
He is mighty and powerful, but also attentive and tender in his feelings with lowly ones.

00:05:43.329 --> 00:05:50.730
Now also note this, Jehovah did not say I see those who are lowly.

00:05:50.730 --> 00:06:00.009
He did not say I hear those who are lowly, but he said I reside with those who are lowly.

00:06:01.009 --> 00:06:05.050
Now to understand this verse better, let us consider a few questions.

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:09.850
First, what is the meaning of reside?

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:17.449
Well, one Bible dictionary defines the Hebrew word translated reside as settle down.

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:23.129
Now what comes to your mind when you hear the expression settle down?

00:06:23.129 --> 00:06:28.209
Does the word make you think of a visitor who rushes in and leaves quickly?

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:39.250
No, instead it makes us think of a visitor who settles in an easy chair, leans back and takes his time to stay with us.

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:47.730
In Jehovah's case, he resides or settled down for the visit with us by means of his holy spirit.

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:49.329
Another question.

00:06:49.329 --> 00:06:53.250
What does Jehovah do when he resides with us?

00:06:53.329 --> 00:06:55.009
Now note the last part of the verse.

00:06:55.009 --> 00:06:58.529
There you see another word that is mentioned two times.

00:06:58.529 --> 00:07:10.529
We read to revive the spirit of the lowly and to revive the heart of those being crushed.

00:07:10.529 --> 00:07:16.370
Now, to revive means to raise from discouragement and depression.

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:29.660
Thus, in this precious scripture, Jehovah promises that he will take his time to be with his humble servants who are discouraged or even crushed.

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:34.139
And why does Jehovah reside with us when we are discouraged?

00:07:34.139 --> 00:07:39.500
To help us to regain the inner peace and the inner strength that we need to deal with,

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:45.339
challenging circumstances and to continue serving Jehovah with joy.

00:07:45.339 --> 00:07:59.819
Now, that is the way in which Jehovah cares for all his humble servants and that is also the way in which Jehovah helped our brothers and sisters who humbly accepted the chains of assignment.

00:07:59.819 --> 00:08:11.819
Jehovah gently helped them to let their feelings of sadness fade away and to embrace the joys that were waiting in their new assignment.

00:08:11.819 --> 00:08:22.779
Now, one couple who received a new assignment related how an illustration helped them to keep in mind what had changed and what had not changed.

00:08:22.779 --> 00:08:25.339
The couple said,

00:08:25.339 --> 00:08:28.420
we think of a parent and children.

00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:33.179
A parent may decide to move a child from one bedroom to another room in the house,

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:40.139
but the child still lives in the same house and receives the same love and care from the parent.

00:08:40.139 --> 00:08:43.179
And then the couple added.

00:08:43.179 --> 00:08:49.820
Likewise, Jehovah may decide to move his servants from one form of full-time service to another one,

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:58.379
but they still live in the same house, so to speak, and receive the same love and protection from Jehovah.

00:08:58.379 --> 00:09:04.299
Indeed, as that couple observed, our assignments made chains,

00:09:04.299 --> 00:09:09.580
but the love that we receive from Jehovah does not change.

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:13.139
In fact, when we show humility,

00:09:13.139 --> 00:09:20.220
Jehovah's warm feelings toward us are bound to increase.

00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:23.299
So what did we consider?

00:09:23.299 --> 00:09:28.500
Jehovah cares for all his servants who are humble.

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:33.019
When you observe that we are overwhelmed with sadness,

00:09:33.019 --> 00:09:38.500
Jehovah will reside with us in order to revive us.

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:42.740
Our brothers and sisters who have humbly accepted a change of assignment

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:49.740
experience how Jehovah helped them to overcome their initial feelings of disappointment.
