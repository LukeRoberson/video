00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.400
It had been 18 years since my last visit to Indonesia.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.399
How had Indonesia changed in the past two decades?

00:00:18.399 --> 00:00:22.399
Since the band was lifted in 2001, let's find out.

00:00:22.399 --> 00:00:26.399
Our trip started with the world's longest flight,

00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:31.399
19 hours non-stop from New York to Singapore.

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:35.399
Then one more flight from Singapore to Jakarta.

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:40.399
Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia, is a bustling metropolis

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:47.090
with a population of over 10 million people.

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:52.399
Once hidden away, our branch office now occupies

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:58.399
the 31st floor in one of the most modern office buildings in Jakarta.

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:03.399
We had the opportunity to spend a week with nearly 100 members

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:05.400
of the Indonesian Bethel family.

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:15.310
We enjoyed our association, worship, and delicious meals together each day.

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.310
Well, first of all, I would like to convey to you

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.310
love and greetings from the governing body.

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:27.310
There were also upbuilding meetings held with each of the various departments.

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:33.310
On Saturday, January 12, 2019, a special meeting was held.

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.310
Over 31,000 people throughout the country

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.849
were able to benefit from the program.

00:01:40.849 --> 00:01:43.849
An update on our activities within Indonesia

00:01:43.849 --> 00:01:46.849
was shared with the brothers and sisters.

00:01:46.849 --> 00:01:51.849
This included a presentation about a special preaching campaign.

00:01:51.849 --> 00:01:55.849
From August 18 to September 2, 2018,

00:01:55.849 --> 00:02:02.849
the Asian Games, a large multi-sport event, was held in Indonesia.

00:02:02.849 --> 00:02:05.849
Jehovah's Witnesses made a special effort to share the good news

00:02:05.849 --> 00:02:08.849
with people from various cultures.

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:13.849
This included many from countries where our activity is limited.

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:17.849
Hundreds of publishers participated in public witnessing

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:23.849
at over 30 locations using literature in 21 languages.

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:28.849
A great witness was given to people from various countries,

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:30.849
tribes, and languages.

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:39.650
Additionally, an update was shared on the tragic events

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:45.650
of September 28, 2018, when a 7.7 magnitude earthquake

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:51.400
and tsunami struck Indonesia.

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.400
The brothers at the branch rang into action.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.400
They took care of both the physical and the spiritual needs

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.400
of the brothers and sisters affected by this disaster.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.400
I'm very grateful to Jehovah, the brothers from the branch office

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.400
and others whose prayers, examples, and presents

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.400
will help us to endure and keep on relying on Jehovah no matter what.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.900
We never felt alone.

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.900
I was so joyful to feel the evidence of Jehovah's love.

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.900
This experience has helped me to see that Jehovah is a real God.

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.900
I felt as David did when he said at Psalm 103.2.

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.900
Let me praise Jehovah. May I never forget all that he has done.

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:44.180
These reports were very faith-strengthening.

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.180
It was encouraging to see how Jehovah has blessed the work in Indonesia.

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:55.180
Since the band was lifted in 2001, the preaching work has accelerated

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.180
and the hard work of the brothers is clearly evident.

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:06.969
By the end of the week, we embraced old friends and made many new ones.

00:04:06.969 --> 00:04:10.969
As the visit ended, it was hard to say goodbye.

00:04:10.969 --> 00:04:15.969
But as we boarded the plane home, we took with us encouragement

00:04:15.969 --> 00:04:20.970
and experiences that we will cherish for years to come.
