00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:04.750
Who are the princes that are to be a hiding place from the wind?

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:08.750
And who will the princes be in the future?

00:00:09.789 --> 00:00:16.629
Isaiah 321, it says look, a king will reign for righteousness, and

00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:26.030
princes will rule for justice, and then our text for today, and each one will be like a hiding place from the wind, a place of concealment from the rain storm.

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:32.070
Well, in our publications, most often the application of the king is Christ Jesus, and

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.429
His reign for righteousness began in 1914.

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.229
Well, who are the princes?

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:45.670
Well, we've consistently indicated that these are the appointed elders in the congregation since 1914.

00:00:46.429 --> 00:00:54.350
And as our text indicated under Jesus' direction, they are to be a hiding place from the wind and rainstorms of Satan's depressing system.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:05.230
But volume 1 of Isaiah prophecy book chapter 25 says, right now, in this time of world of stress, there is a need for princess.

00:01:05.709 --> 00:01:16.549
Yes, elders who will pay attention to all the flock, such princes must meet the qualifications set out in 1 Timothy 3 through 7, the qualifications for elders.

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.670
So who will the princes be in the future after Armageddon?

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.790
Well, just a few sentences later, Isaiah prophecy volume 1 says,

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:39.790
princes, elders who are of the other sheep are being trained as a developing chieftain class, so that after the great tribulation qualified ones from among them.

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:52.189
So not all elders, but from among them will be ready for appointment to serve in an administrative capacity in the new earth, and then it sites Ezekiel 44, the vision of the chieftain class.

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.150
Well, the Hebrew word for prince and chieftain basically makes them synonymous.

00:01:58.109 --> 00:02:04.590
So who would be of the chieftain class in the new world, princes after Armageddon?

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:15.710
Well, find Psalm 45 16 with me, Psalm 45, this again mentions a king in princes, well, who will these princes be?

00:02:16.669 --> 00:02:21.949
If you glance at verse 15, it mentions the king's palace, but then in verse 16 it says,

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:33.629
your, so the kings, your sons will take the place of your forefathers, you will appoint them as princes in all the earth.

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:41.389
Well, when Jesus was on earth, his forefathers were faithful men of old Abraham, Isaac, David, and the like.

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.110
So in the future, when he resurrects them to a paradise earth, they in effect become his sons.

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:56.270
So some princes that will have this administrative capacity in the new earth come from those faithful men of old after the resurrected.

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:05.469
However, the book Holy Spirit, the force behind the coming new order said this, there are already be princes on earth before them.

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:14.430
So before the faithful men of old are resurrected, who it says, those men from among the great crowd of tribulation survivors,

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:21.870
who have been appointed as such at the start of the new world, and then it cites Isaiah 32 of text.

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:31.629
So who will these be, helpers of the governing body, branch committee members, circuit over serious?

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:38.669
Did you notice I'm 45 16 said you will appoint them as princes.

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:45.389
So those who will be princes in the new earth will be appointed by Jesus when they're needed.

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:58.270
One publication said, after Armageddon, we can be confident that Christ will see to it the right men are appointed to represent the kingdom government for he will be taking a direct hand in earth affairs.

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:08.669
And similarly, the 2006 watchtower said, since Jesus Christ himself will appoint the princely representatives.

00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:11.469
So we look forward to that glorious time.

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:14.990
But now we'd like to change directions a little bit.

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:26.110
As we said, we usually infer that Isaiah 32, 1 through 2 is the responsibility of elders that meet the qualifications in 1st Timothy 3, 2 through 4.

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:32.269
So we invite you to turn there to 1st Timothy 3, and we're going to start with verse 2.

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:39.889
But my question is directed to you sisters.

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:50.269
For your age and time and the truth, if you had been born a male, would you currently be a ministerial servant or elder?

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:59.310
You might be thinking, what kind of a question is that? I'm not a male, I'm a female, I'm happy, and 1st Timothy 3 does not apply to me.

00:05:00.269 --> 00:05:02.269
Well, let's look back at the verses.

00:05:02.269 --> 00:05:06.269
You'll see that these are not strictly male oriented qualifications.

00:05:06.269 --> 00:05:11.470
They're basic Christian qualifications, 1st Timothy 2, 3, and 4.

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:16.029
If we made a similar statement about Christian women, would it make sense?

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:19.149
Now, I'm not going to misquote scripture.

00:05:19.149 --> 00:05:25.470
I'm just going to take this list and turn it into a statement for Christian sisters.

00:05:26.029 --> 00:05:27.230
Does it still make sense?

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:31.709
The Christian woman should therefore be irreprehensible.

00:05:31.709 --> 00:05:41.389
A wife of one husband, moderate inhabits, sound in mind, orderly, hospitable, qualified to teach,

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:47.949
not a drunkard, not violent, but reasonable, not quarrelsome, not a level of money,

00:05:47.949 --> 00:05:51.550
a woman presiding over her own household in a fine manner.

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:55.709
We see that statement makes sense for sisters too, doesn't it?

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:59.870
Now, some sisters may say, well, you know, young brothers,

00:06:00.509 --> 00:06:03.550
they're always being encouraged to reach out to be ministerial servants.

00:06:04.269 --> 00:06:09.069
And ministerial servants, usually a couple of times a year, they're reviewed

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:14.829
to see if they match the qualifications of an elder to a reasonable degree.

00:06:15.709 --> 00:06:19.870
And if they don't, usually some point the elders are there encouraging them to improve,

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:23.550
but as a sister, I never get that kind of encouragement to improve to reach out.

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:27.230
Well, if you think about the sisters in your congregation,

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:31.709
isn't it true that they're at different levels of Christian progress?

00:06:31.709 --> 00:06:38.509
Some are beautiful examples of mature Christian sisters who meet these qualifications very well.

00:06:38.509 --> 00:06:40.910
Others could improve.

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:46.750
Well, 35 years ago, there were two married sisters who were pining on our congregation,

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:49.870
and they were excellent example of Christian women.

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:52.670
They were good students and teachers of the Bible.

00:06:53.389 --> 00:06:54.750
Extremely hospitable.

00:06:55.709 --> 00:06:59.310
And when someone was sick or in the hospital, they were at their side supportive.

00:06:59.949 --> 00:07:03.550
A younger sister had a struggle with her ministry or with her children.

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:06.029
They were right there encouraging with sage advice.

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:08.269
And they were very submissive.

00:07:08.269 --> 00:07:11.389
They didn't overstep a good judgment discernment.

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:15.550
Well, 35 years later, when their names come up in a conversation,

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:19.149
everyone is still benefiting from their fine example.

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:24.189
So sisters, no, you do not reach out for the position of overseer,

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:32.990
but you can reach out to enhance in yourself the 13 or 14 qualifications there in 1 Timothy 3, 2, 3, 4.

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:36.509
Why not take them one by one, see what our publications have said,

00:07:36.509 --> 00:07:39.310
how we can manifest them to a greater degree?

00:07:41.439 --> 00:07:42.560
Titus chapter 2

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:46.959
isn't appropriate for sisters to consider Christian qualities.

00:07:46.959 --> 00:07:50.639
When Titus chapter 2 verse 2, it lists some qualities for men to consider.

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:58.800
But then verse 3 says like wise, meaning similarly, let the aged women be reverent and behave,

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:00.800
you're not given to wine and so forth.

00:08:01.759 --> 00:08:06.720
So you sisters, no, you will not be appointed a princess.

00:08:09.439 --> 00:08:14.319
But you will be highly regarded by others in the congregation and by the sovereign of the

00:08:14.319 --> 00:08:24.319
universe, Jehovah.
