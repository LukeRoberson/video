00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.480
We live in a world full of events that cause suffering to millions of people.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.479
We're not completely surprised because we are living in the last days.

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:40.479
But suffering can and has turned many away from God.

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:43.479
They blame Him. They're angry at Him.

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:46.479
So how do our brothers and sisters cope?

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:49.479
The Apostle Paul was familiar with suffering.

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:53.479
When he wrote his second letter to Timothy, Paul was in prison.

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:56.479
What did he say about the subject?

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:59.479
Second Timothy 1 verse 8, Paul says,

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:06.480
Take your part in suffering adversity for the good news by relying on the power of God.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.480
The context shows that we suffer because of our Christian faith,

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:15.480
but it stands true that God's power can help us through any adversity.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.480
That's why today we want to interview Gilead students from two countries

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.480
that have experienced adversity.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.480
Venezuela and Rwanda.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.480
And see through the interviews how God's power helped them to endure

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.480
and to thrive spiritually.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:52.650
First, please welcome Gilead and Elis Muitinesa from the beautiful country of Rwanda.

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.650
Welcome Gilead and Elis.

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:56.650
It's nice to spend some time with you both.

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:57.650
Thank you.

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.650
Now, understand that you were born and raised in Rwanda

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.650
and now you serve at the branch.

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.650
Tell us a little bit about your country.

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.650
Rwanda is called the land of a thousand years.

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:15.650
Within one country, you will see rainforests,

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.650
volcanoes, mountains, and nice valleys.

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.650
We have an amazing Wari Dreyftoon.

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.500
That is amazing.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.500
And what about the people?

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.500
People are very warm, respectful and hospitable.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.500
In fact, it's very easy to start a Bible conversation with people you meet.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.500
Oh, enjoyable.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.500
In this picture, what's happening with you and the children?

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.500
In this village, it was the first time these children were watching the video

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.500
of Caliban Sophia and they were very happy.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.500
That's precious.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.500
When we hear Rwanda, many of us can't help,

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.500
but think back to that terrible time,

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.500
the genocide against the Tutsi.

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.500
Can you explain what happened?

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.500
It was frightening.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:11.500
It was reported that as many as a million people were killed

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.500
including 400 of our brothers and sisters.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:21.500
And this happened in a short span of just a hundred days.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:27.500
I can't imagine anybody going through such horror.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:34.500
And that was 1994, which means this year marks exactly 30 years since that event.

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.500
How old were you then?

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.500
We were teenagers, 15 years, 16 years.

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.500
To go through that as a youth, as a teenager,

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.500
how terrifying.

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.500
What helped you to cope?

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.500
For me, my parents were Jehovah's Witnesses

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.500
and they set a very good example for us.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.500
I was one of 10 children, but my parents took in my young cousin.

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.500
But they also opened their home for more children.

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.500
They took 11 more.

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.500
And in the family, in total, we were 25.

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.500
Why did your parents take in the other children?

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.500
Unfortunately, they were all found by the genocide.

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.500
25 children.

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.500
That's a lot of miles to feed.

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.500
Yes, I remember one time my mom made chicken

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:25.500
and she cut the chicken into 25 different pieces

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.500
and put them on a platter.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.500
Then she told all children to close their eyes

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.500
and pick a piece of chicken.

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.500
So wherever you pick, you pick.

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.500
And where did you all sleep at night?

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.500
Every evening, we would lay mattresses in no rooms

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.500
so that the kids could get where to sleep.

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.500
Thank you for describing that life to us.

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.500
Was it hard for you?

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.500
No, it was not hard because of two reasons.

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:55.500
First of all, the whole country was in the same situation.

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.500
Second, my parents will get some financial help

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.500
and the elders in the congregation told them

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.500
that this was from the worldwide brotherhood

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.500
of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:09.500
And to see this as a young person,

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.500
it really touched me, Brother Clark.

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.500
I was wondering how brothers and sisters

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.500
who I never met before were helping me.

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.500
I was really touched.

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.500
That is the power of God,

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.500
working through our loving worldwide brotherhood.

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.500
Beautiful.

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.500
What was your experience, did you, darling?

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:33.500
I was also shown so much love this time.

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:36.500
For me, my parents were not in the truth

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:40.500
and I was just an unbakedized publisher.

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:43.500
Still, the elders came to me

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.500
and provided me with material assistance

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.500
for food and clothing.

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:51.500
In fact, I got my first suit jacket

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.500
for the meeting from them.

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.500
I remember thinking,

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:56.500
why me?

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.500
I'm not yet even baptized.

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:01.500
But they remembered me.

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:03.500
Seeing Jehovah's love

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:07.500
like this affected me deeply.

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.500
That's encouraging.

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:12.500
Now, here's a picture of you on the left,

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:14.500
in a suit jacket.

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:16.500
How old are you there?

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:17.500
They are.

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.500
I am around 18.

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:20.500
And who's that with you?

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.500
That's my cousin.

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:24.500
And my Bible teacher.

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:25.500
Your cousin taught you the Bible?

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:26.500
Yes.

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:28.500
How's he doing today?

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:29.500
He's doing very well.

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:33.500
In fact, he's here with us during our graduation.

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:34.500
Today?

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:35.500
Yes.

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:37.500
Welcome, cousin.

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:41.500
What a moment for you and a moment for you, too.

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:43.500
And how's your family doing, Elise?

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:45.500
I'm happy to say that all my siblings

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:48.500
and my wee-dod mom served Jehovah.

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:49.500
Beautiful.

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:51.500
Now, how many sisters do you have?

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:54.500
Four sisters and their families.

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:56.500
And how many brothers?

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:57.500
Five.

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:59.500
Five brothers and their families.

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:02.500
And they're all doing well spiritually.

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:05.980
What a blessing.

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:09.980
If we could go back to the events of 1994,

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:12.980
when the genocide stopped,

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:15.980
what happened to our brothers and sisters?

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:18.980
Something amazing happened.

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:20.980
You see,

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:23.980
years before the genocide,

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:28.980
there were some brothers living outside the country as refugees.

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:30.980
During the genocide,

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:33.980
more brothers fled the country.

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:35.980
So after the genocide,

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:38.980
the Erdas helped those brothers

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:40.980
to find their way back home.

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:43.980
Then after, they started shepherding everyone

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:45.980
to promote unity.

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:46.980
How good.

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:50.980
But if they're all Rwandan brothers and sisters,

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:53.980
then why were the elders focusing on unity?

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:56.980
They were strong feelings for those who fled the country

00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:58.980
and those who stayed.

00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:02.980
But the Erdas used Bible accounts

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:04.980
and the Bible principles

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:05.980
to help them see

00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:08.980
that freeing was a personal decision.

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:11.980
And this helped the brothers

00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:13.980
to unite Mokitri.

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:14.980
I see.

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:17.980
Again, the power of God working through the elder arrangement

00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:19.980
to unify them.

00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:22.980
And were the results of all that shepherding?

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:24.980
Yes.

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:28.980
You see, the genocide was stopped in the dry 1994.

00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:30.980
A few months later,

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:34.980
in December, we tried off our first assembly.

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:39.980
3,000 people came from all the corners of the country.

00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:43.980
The local authorities saying this, they stopped us.

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:46.980
They were saying it was not safe yet.

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:50.980
But I remember that before leaving the assembly grounds,

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:53.980
we were hugging and hugging

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:56.980
and we could see love and unity

00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:58.980
among our brothers and sisters.

00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:00.980
We never forget that.

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:02.980
That is beautiful.

00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:05.980
Did the genocide cause our brothers and sisters

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:07.980
to slow down in their ministry?

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:08.980
Slow down?

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:10.980
No way, my brother.

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:13.980
When you see Jehovah's love like this,

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:15.980
you feel like a Jeremiah.

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:17.980
You cannot hold it in.

00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:18.980
Yeah, it's true.

00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:19.980
It's not easy to explain,

00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:22.980
but the more Satan tries to make you fear,

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:24.980
the more courage Jehovah gives you.

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:26.980
And it's like fire inside

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:29.980
you want to preach the good news to others.

00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:30.980
That's good to hear.

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:33.980
And what's the result of that fire and zeal?

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:37.980
In 1994, we were 2,500 publishers in Rwanda.

00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:40.980
But now we are over 33,000 publishers.

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:42.980
And looking at the latest report,

00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:46.980
we've had a worldwide increase of almost 2%,

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:47.980
which is great.

00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:49.980
But in that same time, five years,

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:52.980
Rwanda has had over 8% increase.

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:55.980
The publishers in Rwanda are thriving.

00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:58.980
In fact, Rwanda is not occurred

00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:00.980
only the land of thousands here.

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:04.980
It is also called the land of thousands of miles.

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:06.980
Like your smiles right now.

00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:08.980
Thank you so much, brother and sister Muaytenezah,

00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:11.980
for encouraging us, strengthening us.

00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:14.980
We pray that Jehovah continue to bless you

00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:16.980
and the brothers and sisters in Rwanda.

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:17.980
Thank you.

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:18.980
Thank you.

00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:21.980
Next, let's interview Ronald Rodriguez

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:24.980
from the beautiful country of Venezuela.

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:42.370
Ronald, it's nice to have you here.

00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:43.370
Thank you.

00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:45.370
Tell us a little bit about your life.

00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:48.370
I was raised in the truth by good parents.

00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:51.370
I go baptized out of a young age.

00:10:51.370 --> 00:10:52.370
I have a picture of that.

00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:53.370
Would you like to say it?

00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:54.370
I would.

00:10:54.370 --> 00:10:59.370
That's me in Caracas, the capital city of Venezuela.

00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:02.370
It was exactly the day I go baptized.

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:04.370
As you can see, I was very little.

00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:05.370
I was just 10 years old.

00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:07.370
Very nice, Ronald.

00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:11.370
May I ask what motivated you to get baptized at that age?

00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:13.370
It was definitely my parents' example.

00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:17.370
I watched how they kept their loyalty and integrity to Jehovah

00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:19.370
despite facing difficult challenges.

00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:21.370
So that example really impressed me.

00:11:21.370 --> 00:11:22.370
Very nice.

00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:24.370
And this is your parents now?

00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:26.370
They are my parents.

00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:28.370
Gracias, mama, a papa.

00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:31.370
They did a good job raising their children.

00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:33.370
And now you work at the branch?

00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:34.370
How long have you been there?

00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:36.370
For about six years.

00:11:36.370 --> 00:11:38.370
And currently I work in the PID.

00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:40.370
A public information department.

00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:42.370
And what do you do in that department?

00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:47.370
In that department, we assist with providing information about our activities

00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:52.370
to government officials, to the media, and also to those in the academic field.

00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:54.370
Well, thank you for your hard work.

00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:59.370
Now, this picture is you at Bethel with some members of the family?

00:11:59.370 --> 00:12:01.370
Yes, that's at my office.

00:12:02.370 --> 00:12:05.370
You see there is one of my fellow Bethelites in Venezuela.

00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:08.370
And that picture has a special meaning for me.

00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:12.370
Do you see the sister on the left at the front?

00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:14.370
She was Janice Bladwood.

00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:18.370
She was one of the first missionaries that came to Venezuela from Gilead.

00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:19.370
One of the first?

00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:20.370
Yes.

00:12:20.370 --> 00:12:21.370
It was in the 50s.

00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:22.370
Wow.

00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:26.370
And she would come to our office every Thursday for a coffee break.

00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:28.370
And she was full of stories.

00:12:29.370 --> 00:12:36.370
So she would tell us beautiful experience they had when she came to Venezuela with other sisters.

00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:40.370
And so every time that we had a question about our theocratic history,

00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:42.370
she was there to answer the question.

00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:44.370
What a rich heritage you have.

00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:46.370
Yeah, we really loved her visits.

00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:50.370
Unfortunately, she passed away recently last November.

00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:51.370
You're going to miss her?

00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:52.370
Yeah, definitely.

00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:55.370
Because we treasure good memories with her.

00:12:56.370 --> 00:13:01.370
By the way, Ronald's not only smiling in pictures, he's always smiling.

00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:07.809
In fact, you think that he was from Rwanda, the land of a thousand smiles.

00:13:07.809 --> 00:13:10.809
But seriously, it has not always been smiles for you.

00:13:10.809 --> 00:13:11.809
You've had some challenges.

00:13:11.809 --> 00:13:12.809
Would you like to explain?

00:13:12.809 --> 00:13:13.809
Sure.

00:13:13.809 --> 00:13:17.809
I always wanted to attend a theocratic school.

00:13:17.809 --> 00:13:20.809
In 2018, I was invited to SKE.

00:13:20.809 --> 00:13:25.809
But at the same time, I received an excellent paint-up offer.

00:13:25.809 --> 00:13:26.809
It was super good.

00:13:26.809 --> 00:13:32.809
But I turned it down because I didn't want anything to prevent me from going to SKE.

00:13:32.809 --> 00:13:37.809
The thing was that five days before the start of the classes, the school was canceled.

00:13:37.809 --> 00:13:38.809
Cancelled?

00:13:38.809 --> 00:13:39.809
Yes.

00:13:39.809 --> 00:13:40.809
How did you feel?

00:13:40.809 --> 00:13:43.809
Well, honestly, it was hard time for me.

00:13:43.809 --> 00:13:45.809
I felt depressed.

00:13:45.809 --> 00:13:47.809
I didn't know what to do.

00:13:47.809 --> 00:13:51.809
Yeah, you had no school and no job offer anymore.

00:13:51.809 --> 00:13:53.809
So what did you do?

00:13:53.809 --> 00:13:57.809
I was just doing some little jobs, whatever I could find.

00:13:57.809 --> 00:13:59.809
That would be stressful.

00:13:59.809 --> 00:14:01.809
Why did they cancel the school?

00:14:01.809 --> 00:14:04.809
It was because of the economic situation in the country.

00:14:04.809 --> 00:14:13.809
I would say that between the years 2017 to 2019, those years were particularly difficult for us in Venezuela.

00:14:13.809 --> 00:14:17.809
Due to hyperinflation, foot shortages were very common.

00:14:17.809 --> 00:14:23.809
Well, we understand inflation, but can you explain how hyperinflation would affect you personally?

00:14:23.809 --> 00:14:32.809
Because the prices for basic things like food, medicines, or clothing, those prices could increase dramatically.

00:14:32.809 --> 00:14:37.809
For example, what I could afford in the morning, I could not afford by the end of the day.

00:14:37.809 --> 00:14:40.809
And the following day, the price would increase again.

00:14:40.809 --> 00:14:41.809
That's unbearable.

00:14:41.809 --> 00:14:49.809
Yeah, and during that time for me, especially 2017, 2018, I was pioneering and struggling to make ends meet.

00:14:49.809 --> 00:14:54.809
But I got to see how Jehovah was there for me personally.

00:14:54.809 --> 00:15:03.809
One of the most special things I remember, it was one moment that I didn't have a money to eat enough food for two days.

00:15:03.809 --> 00:15:08.809
So I was worried and emotionally I was not feeling well.

00:15:08.809 --> 00:15:13.809
But I remember that I set a prayer to Jehovah just in that moment.

00:15:13.809 --> 00:15:15.809
And it was amazing.

00:15:15.809 --> 00:15:20.809
Just within minutes of that prayer, I received a call from a sister.

00:15:20.809 --> 00:15:23.809
And she was asking me a really surprising question.

00:15:23.809 --> 00:15:25.809
What is your bank account number?

00:15:25.809 --> 00:15:27.809
She wanted to send you funds.

00:15:27.809 --> 00:15:28.809
Yes.

00:15:28.809 --> 00:15:32.809
And she told me that it was from our brothers and sisters from all the countries.

00:15:32.809 --> 00:15:36.809
They sent some of money to be divided between five people.

00:15:36.809 --> 00:15:39.809
And I was selected to be the fifth person.

00:15:39.809 --> 00:15:40.809
We were the fifth.

00:15:40.809 --> 00:15:41.809
Yes.

00:15:41.809 --> 00:15:43.809
It was very special for me.

00:15:43.809 --> 00:15:47.809
It provided for my meals for a whole week.

00:15:47.809 --> 00:15:52.809
And the answer to that prayer is something that I cannot forget.

00:15:52.809 --> 00:16:00.809
No, just moments after praying and you get an answer, that's the power of God affecting you in a very personal way.

00:16:00.809 --> 00:16:02.809
Well, that is really encouraging.

00:16:02.809 --> 00:16:05.809
What else helped you through that period of anxiety?

00:16:05.809 --> 00:16:06.809
I love nature.

00:16:06.809 --> 00:16:11.809
And like Rwanda Venezuela has many beautiful landscapes all in one country.

00:16:11.809 --> 00:16:13.809
We have spectacular beaches.

00:16:13.809 --> 00:16:17.809
We have deserts, jungles, mountains.

00:16:17.809 --> 00:16:23.809
And I know that many people have probably heard about the famous Angel Falls.

00:16:23.809 --> 00:16:27.809
And for me, I found a place that I could really enjoy.

00:16:27.809 --> 00:16:31.809
There in Caracas, the capital, we have a mountain.

00:16:31.809 --> 00:16:33.809
It is called El Avila.

00:16:34.809 --> 00:16:36.809
That was a very special place for me.

00:16:36.809 --> 00:16:40.809
I would hike up that mountain very often.

00:16:40.809 --> 00:16:45.809
Because I found that being out there into help us, beautiful creation,

00:16:45.809 --> 00:16:48.809
it helped me to get closer to Jehovah.

00:16:48.809 --> 00:16:53.809
And when I was there talking to Jehovah, all my insight is that it just went away.

00:16:53.809 --> 00:16:55.809
And I was calm and refreshed.

00:16:55.809 --> 00:17:00.809
I'm glad you found a spot you could go where it was just you and Jehovah alone.

00:17:00.809 --> 00:17:02.809
We all need that.

00:17:02.809 --> 00:17:03.809
Very good.

00:17:03.809 --> 00:17:07.809
Meanwhile, how are the brothers and sisters coping through this anxiety?

00:17:07.809 --> 00:17:09.809
That's incredible to me.

00:17:09.809 --> 00:17:16.809
I would see the brothers and sisters openly sharing the little they had with one another.

00:17:16.809 --> 00:17:18.809
And sometimes it was very little.

00:17:18.809 --> 00:17:20.809
But they were just sharing that.

00:17:20.809 --> 00:17:21.809
Very nice.

00:17:21.809 --> 00:17:23.809
What is she holding?

00:17:23.809 --> 00:17:24.809
That's a vegetable.

00:17:24.809 --> 00:17:26.809
We call that auyama in Venezuela.

00:17:26.809 --> 00:17:29.809
But honestly, I never remembered the name in English.

00:17:29.809 --> 00:17:31.809
It looks like a squash.

00:17:31.809 --> 00:17:33.809
I think it's that.

00:17:33.809 --> 00:17:41.809
It was a disaster relief program that the branches started to encourage the brothers and sisters to start growing food.

00:17:41.809 --> 00:17:44.809
So if you have a farm, grow food and share with...

00:17:44.809 --> 00:17:46.809
No, not necessarily.

00:17:46.809 --> 00:17:49.809
You could participate with or without experience.

00:17:49.809 --> 00:17:50.809
Anybody.

00:17:50.809 --> 00:17:51.809
Anybody, yeah?

00:17:51.809 --> 00:17:55.809
And if you did have experience, you were given some training.

00:17:55.809 --> 00:17:59.809
Not just in lands, but also in balconies, in gardens.

00:17:59.809 --> 00:18:01.809
So basically everywhere.

00:18:01.809 --> 00:18:04.809
So get some dirt and start planting.

00:18:04.809 --> 00:18:05.809
Yes.

00:18:05.809 --> 00:18:07.809
How did they respond to that encouragement?

00:18:07.809 --> 00:18:08.809
It was contagious.

00:18:08.809 --> 00:18:11.809
You would see the brothers enjoying that activity.

00:18:11.809 --> 00:18:13.809
They were so happy doing that.

00:18:13.809 --> 00:18:14.809
That's beautiful.

00:18:14.809 --> 00:18:18.809
There's again God's power working through His organization.

00:18:18.809 --> 00:18:21.809
And the brothers and sisters are responding.

00:18:21.809 --> 00:18:22.809
Yes.

00:18:22.809 --> 00:18:23.809
That's wonderful.

00:18:23.809 --> 00:18:28.809
Especially for brothers and sisters who had no jobs or lost their jobs.

00:18:28.809 --> 00:18:36.809
Yeah, that point is very interesting because many of the brothers or sisters were in that situation without jobs.

00:18:36.809 --> 00:18:38.809
But they didn't give into despair.

00:18:38.809 --> 00:18:40.809
They decided to pioneer.

00:18:40.809 --> 00:18:43.809
That example really touches my heart.

00:18:43.809 --> 00:18:49.809
So they're going through adversity, but they're thinking, what more can I do for Jehovah?

00:18:49.809 --> 00:18:51.809
That is so encouraging.

00:18:51.809 --> 00:18:52.809
Yes.

00:18:52.809 --> 00:18:54.809
Ronald, did you ever get to SK?

00:18:54.809 --> 00:18:57.809
I did, but I guess what?

00:18:57.809 --> 00:18:58.809
What happened?

00:18:58.809 --> 00:19:02.809
I received an excellent paying job offer at the same time again.

00:19:02.809 --> 00:19:03.809
Again.

00:19:03.809 --> 00:19:08.809
And this time you thought maybe I should hang on to the job in case they cancel the school?

00:19:08.809 --> 00:19:09.809
Absolutely not.

00:19:09.809 --> 00:19:17.809
Because that amazing job offer came at the same time that everyone in the country was struggling to get a decent job.

00:19:17.809 --> 00:19:21.809
And I had this new invitation for going to this school.

00:19:21.809 --> 00:19:24.809
So I knew who was behind the temptation.

00:19:24.809 --> 00:19:27.809
And I knew it was not Jehovah, of course.

00:19:27.809 --> 00:19:30.809
So I didn't accept that job offer.

00:19:30.809 --> 00:19:32.809
I went to SK and it was wonderful.

00:19:32.809 --> 00:19:33.809
Well done.

00:19:33.809 --> 00:19:36.809
And after graduation, what was your assignment?

00:19:36.809 --> 00:19:43.809
Well, I received an assignment, but three days after the graduation, that was changed.

00:19:43.809 --> 00:19:46.809
And that time I was invited to go to Bethel.

00:19:46.809 --> 00:19:48.809
I was really not expecting that.

00:19:48.809 --> 00:19:53.809
Especially because I was asked to work in departments that I didn't have any experience in.

00:19:53.809 --> 00:19:54.809
Like PID.

00:19:54.809 --> 00:19:55.809
Yes.

00:19:55.809 --> 00:20:01.809
And my first assignment was in hospital information department, no experience.

00:20:01.809 --> 00:20:08.809
So for both assignments, I felt very unqualified, asking myself how am I going to do this?

00:20:08.809 --> 00:20:12.809
But then I realized something.

00:20:12.809 --> 00:20:16.809
Does I have seen Jehovah's steady hand before in my life?

00:20:16.809 --> 00:20:20.809
I would experience that again for this new chapter, and I have.

00:20:20.809 --> 00:20:25.809
I like that expression. Jehovah's steady hand, three times of anxiety.

00:20:25.809 --> 00:20:30.809
Now, for our brothers and sisters, currently, is it any better?

00:20:30.809 --> 00:20:32.809
In some ways, things have improved.

00:20:32.809 --> 00:20:37.809
But honestly, we will need to hope to permanently fix the situation.

00:20:37.809 --> 00:20:41.809
However, spiritually, our brothers are thriving in Venezuela.

00:20:41.809 --> 00:20:42.809
Really?

00:20:42.809 --> 00:20:43.809
Yes.

00:20:43.809 --> 00:20:46.809
Because we have so many pioneers, so many publishers.

00:20:46.809 --> 00:20:50.809
It's so common and so encouraging that you go to a congregation.

00:20:50.809 --> 00:20:56.809
And you see that 30 or 40% of the publishers are serving as regular pioneers.

00:20:56.809 --> 00:21:02.809
And I can tell you that personally, what really impresses me is that it's not just the older ones,

00:21:02.809 --> 00:21:05.809
but also the young ones, our pioneer.

00:21:05.809 --> 00:21:10.809
In Venezuela, now we have hundreds of pioneers under the age of 15, for example.

00:21:11.809 --> 00:21:16.809
So, older ones and younger ones relying on the power of God to get through this adversity

00:21:16.809 --> 00:21:19.809
as they remain zealous for the ministry.

00:21:19.809 --> 00:21:20.809
That is so encouraging.

00:21:20.809 --> 00:21:24.809
Yes, that's why I love my brothers and sisters in Venezuela.

00:21:24.809 --> 00:21:25.809
They keep enduring.

00:21:25.809 --> 00:21:29.809
And we have wonderful association, good time together.

00:21:29.809 --> 00:21:32.809
I'm so sure that's because we have been through so much together.

00:21:32.809 --> 00:21:33.809
I agree.

00:21:33.809 --> 00:21:37.809
You have a shared experience where you've bonded together through adversity

00:21:37.809 --> 00:21:42.809
and you're thriving spiritually and staying close together.

00:21:42.809 --> 00:21:44.809
Ronald, this has been so encouraging.

00:21:44.809 --> 00:21:47.809
Thank you very much for strengthening our faith.

00:21:47.809 --> 00:21:52.809
And we pray that Jehovah continue to bless you and the brothers and sisters in Venezuela as well.

00:21:52.809 --> 00:21:54.809
Thank you.

00:21:54.809 --> 00:21:59.809
Now, let's interview Dimitri and Elsa Litzios from Greece.

00:21:59.809 --> 00:22:16.079
Welcome, Dimitri and Elsa.

00:22:16.079 --> 00:22:17.079
Happy to have you here.

00:22:17.079 --> 00:22:18.079
Thank you.

00:22:19.079 --> 00:22:25.079
The last inside story, we got a tour of some of the Bible lands in what is now Turkey.

00:22:25.079 --> 00:22:30.079
So, we thought, because you're from Greece, could we see some of the Bible lands from your country too?

00:22:30.079 --> 00:22:32.079
Of course.

00:22:32.079 --> 00:22:36.079
We have many places in Greece that are mentioned in the Bible.

00:22:36.079 --> 00:22:41.079
And when you see these ancient sites, they really help make Bible come alive.

00:22:41.079 --> 00:22:42.079
That's right.

00:22:42.079 --> 00:22:46.079
That's why we have prepared a video that we can show to everyone.

00:22:46.079 --> 00:22:47.079
Can we see it now?

00:22:47.079 --> 00:22:48.079
Yes.

00:22:48.079 --> 00:22:49.079
Of course.

00:22:49.079 --> 00:22:51.490
Please enjoy.

00:22:51.490 --> 00:22:57.490
Paul spent much of his second and third missionary tours in Greece and Macedonia.

00:22:57.490 --> 00:22:58.490
That's right.

00:22:58.490 --> 00:23:03.490
Let's take a walk back in time alongside the Apostle Paul.

00:23:03.490 --> 00:23:10.490
Paul began his second missionary tour in Apolis, which is the modern day city of Cavala.

00:23:10.490 --> 00:23:13.490
He came here by boat from Troas.

00:23:13.490 --> 00:23:16.490
Do you remember what brought Paul here?

00:23:16.490 --> 00:23:20.490
He received a vision in which a Macedonian man entrusted him.

00:23:20.490 --> 00:23:24.490
Step over into Macedonia and help us.

00:23:24.490 --> 00:23:28.490
And so Paul answered the call and came here.

00:23:28.490 --> 00:23:29.490
That's right.

00:23:29.490 --> 00:23:32.490
From here, Paul traveled to Philippine.

00:23:32.490 --> 00:23:40.490
This took him about three or four hours as he crossed the mountain range between the two cities.

00:23:40.490 --> 00:23:45.490
Located in the eastern region of Macedonia, this city was privileged to be the first in Europe

00:23:45.490 --> 00:23:50.490
to hear Paul preach the good news around 50 CE.

00:23:50.490 --> 00:23:54.490
And things went really well at first.

00:23:54.490 --> 00:23:59.490
It was here that Lydia and her entire family became believers.

00:23:59.490 --> 00:24:05.490
But soon, Paul faced adversity when he was thrown into prison, along with his friend Silas.

00:24:05.490 --> 00:24:11.490
Interestingly, you can still see ruins of an ancient prison in Philippine.

00:24:11.490 --> 00:24:18.490
While we cannot say for sure, it is possible that Paul and Silas stayed here overnight.

00:24:18.490 --> 00:24:24.490
But by the power of God, they were miraculously released.

00:24:24.490 --> 00:24:30.490
Also in Philippine, you can walk along the famous road called the Via Ignatia.

00:24:30.490 --> 00:24:37.490
This was the first major Roman highway built outside of Rome, linking Europe with Asia.

00:24:37.490 --> 00:24:44.490
Next, Paul and Silas arrived in Thessalonica, the city where I was born.

00:24:44.490 --> 00:24:49.490
Paul's first two letters were addressed to the congregation here.

00:24:49.490 --> 00:24:56.490
Not long after that, Paul and Silas arrived in Berea, and they had a very good experience here.

00:24:56.490 --> 00:25:03.490
Yes, the Bible tells us that the Bereans accepted the world with the greatest ignorance of mind,

00:25:03.490 --> 00:25:08.490
carefully examining the scriptures daily to see whether these things were true.

00:25:08.490 --> 00:25:11.490
And as a result, many became believers.

00:25:11.490 --> 00:25:15.490
Today, ancient Berea is known as Berea.

00:25:15.490 --> 00:25:22.490
You can visit a synagogue that was built around 1850 CE on top of the ruins of an ancient synagogue.

00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:26.490
Perhaps Paul preached right here.

00:25:26.490 --> 00:25:28.490
One day, we'll find out.

00:25:28.490 --> 00:25:32.490
After Berea, Paul had his south towards Athens.

00:25:32.490 --> 00:25:39.490
By Paul's time, this city was known primarily as the center of Greek learning, literature and art.

00:25:39.490 --> 00:25:46.490
It was home to famous philosophers such as Socrates, Plato and Aristotel.

00:25:46.490 --> 00:25:49.490
It was also a very religious city.

00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:55.490
I was found in temples, public squares and on the streets.

00:25:55.490 --> 00:26:00.490
People regularly prayed to the gods before engaging in many activities.

00:26:00.490 --> 00:26:06.490
Yes, and it was here at the Ereopagus, or Mars Hill, as it is sometimes called,

00:26:06.490 --> 00:26:11.490
that Paul gave an eloquent witness about the unknown god.

00:26:11.490 --> 00:26:19.490
In fact, today, you can see a bronze plaque on Mars Hill that includes these speeds of the Apostle Paul.

00:26:19.490 --> 00:26:23.490
And finally, we come to Corinth, to the far south.

00:26:23.490 --> 00:26:28.490
This city was a busy crossroads for commerce and trading.

00:26:28.490 --> 00:26:35.490
You can see ruins of the judgment seat known as the Bima, temples and many other things here.

00:26:35.490 --> 00:26:42.490
In fact, during class, we used our study Bible media to see and learn more about Corinth.

00:26:42.490 --> 00:26:45.490
There is a lot there if you like history.

00:26:45.490 --> 00:26:51.490
Well, we hope you enjoyed traveling with us in some of the Apostle Paul's footsteps.

00:26:51.490 --> 00:26:58.490
Today, our brothers and sisters in Greece are working very hard in imitation of the Apostle Paul.

00:26:58.490 --> 00:27:01.490
And they joyfully sent you Mars love.

00:27:01.490 --> 00:27:10.819
That was fantastic.

00:27:10.819 --> 00:27:12.819
Thank you so much for showing that.

00:27:12.819 --> 00:27:13.819
Our pleasure.

00:27:13.819 --> 00:27:19.819
And it's nice to see modern-day Paul's and Silas' and Lidias, Zealous and the Preaching Work.

00:27:19.819 --> 00:27:23.819
Please send our love back to the brothers and sisters in Greece for us.

00:27:23.819 --> 00:27:25.819
Thank you.

00:27:25.819 --> 00:27:27.819
Did you enjoy that video?

00:27:28.819 --> 00:27:31.819
And what did you think of the two interviews?

00:27:31.819 --> 00:27:35.819
What helped our brothers and sisters to cope through that adversity?

00:27:35.819 --> 00:27:43.220
Remember, 2 Timothy 1 verse 8, it was by the power of God.

00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:46.220
Are you suffering through adversity right now?

00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:54.220
Know that Jehovah sees you and that his mighty arm will help you to endure with patience and with joy.

00:27:54.220 --> 00:27:59.220
Our brothers and sisters in Venezuela and Rwanda are an encouraging example to us.

00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:06.220
They saw the power of God help them, and in many ways it was through the organization and the loving brotherhood.

00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:11.220
Stay close with Jehovah's organization, remain united with the brotherhood,

00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:17.220
and we will endure any adversity that comes our way until our reward comes.

00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:22.220
We look forward to seeing you again on the next episode of The Inside Story.
