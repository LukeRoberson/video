00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:14.849
Many people equate drinking with having a good time, but at Proverbs 2332, the Bible says

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.649
that alcohol can bite like a snake.

00:00:18.649 --> 00:00:22.170
Are there laws on drinking alcohol where you live?

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:30.789
If so, you could be fined, be sentenced to community service, lose your freedom to drive,

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:33.570
or even go to jail.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.969
Even if none of those things happen, alcohol can lower your inhibitions, and not in a good

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:39.969
way.

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:45.210
Under the influence, you could say or do things you'll later regret.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.609
But what if you're at a party, and unexpectedly find that some are drinking and heading for

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:51.609
trouble?

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:53.929
What would you do?

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:59.009
The Bible says that an intelligent person sees trouble coming and avoids it.

00:00:59.009 --> 00:01:00.810
Stop and think.

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.530
What might happen if you stay?

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.849
How could you leave before trouble comes without inviting ridicule?

00:01:08.849 --> 00:01:10.370
Here's a tip.

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:15.900
Make a plan with your parents to call or text if you need to leave early.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.019
How about this?

00:01:18.019 --> 00:01:21.579
What would you do if someone pressures you to drink?

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:27.180
At Romans 616, the Bible indicates that when you let others control your decisions, you

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.019
become their slave.

00:01:30.019 --> 00:01:35.980
You could just follow along and let your peers rule your life, or you could give a firm

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:42.980
response, perhaps something like no thanks, or sorry, I'm not into that.

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:47.340
What if you're out with friends and realize the driver's been drinking?

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.540
According to the Bible, the person who spends time with fools will fare badly.

00:01:52.540 --> 00:02:00.099
What could happen if you let that person drive you home?

00:02:00.099 --> 00:02:02.140
What are their options do you have?

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.140
Try this.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:09.020
Avoid situations where you'll be with a driver who has a reputation for drinking and driving.

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.099
Always have a plan B for transportation.

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:17.500
Remember, you don't have to drink to have a good time, and you don't have to associate

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.020
with people who think that you do.

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.620
Have the courage to think past the drink.
