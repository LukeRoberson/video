00:00:01.169 --> 00:00:08.109
After 57 years of marriage, Edward and Gwen are still deeply in love, what's their secret?

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:16.949
While they say their relationship is built on noticing, thinking about, and enjoying each other's good qualities.

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.350
And that makes sense, right? Because that's how our relationship with Jehovah works as well.

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:29.190
James 4 and 8 says, draw close to Jehovah, and he will draw close to you.

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:37.189
As we take steps towards Jehovah, he reciprocates, and he takes steps towards us.

00:00:37.189 --> 00:00:40.149
Well, what kind of steps should we take?

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:43.350
Hebrews 11 and 6 explains it this way.

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.750
It says,

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.630
moreover, without faith, it is impossible to please God well,

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.710
for whoever approaches God must believe that He is,

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:01.429
and that He becomes the rewarder of those earnestly seeking Him.

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:07.430
Now, relationships are built on trust, and trust is really an act of faith.

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:15.750
So, if we want to get closer to Jehovah, we have to earnestly seek Him, Paul says.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.510
We need to be more curious, more open-minded, and show more courage.

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.230
Moses did this so well.

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:33.109
Let's see how, in his life, applying these three steps allowed him to draw very close to Jehovah.

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:38.310
Step number one, be more curious. Moses searched all his life for Jehovah,

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.709
and his curiosity opened the door to all sorts of rewarding experiences.

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:44.549
Let's consider just one example.

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:51.590
Open your Bibles again with me to Exodus chapter 3 and verse 3,

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:58.310
and notice his reaction when he sees that thornbush burning in the wilderness and not burning up.

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.269
In verse 3, we read,

00:02:01.269 --> 00:02:08.150
I will go over to inspect this unusual site to see why the thornbush does not burn up.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.479
Now, we all know what happens next.

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:16.560
It leads to a life-changing conversation with Jehovah,

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.960
but did you notice his curiosity?

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.759
I'm not sure. I would have done that, would you?

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:29.759
40 years earlier, Acts 7.23 says it came into his heart to make a visit on his brothers,

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:31.520
the Israelites who were slaves.

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:37.520
And again, less than a year later, after the thornbush incident,

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:43.360
Moses is recorded as Exodus 33, 18, as asking Jehovah,

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.919
please show me your glory.

00:02:46.719 --> 00:02:48.159
Now, do you see the pattern here?

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.319
Moses was curious in a very good way.

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:56.080
He wanted to know more about Jehovah and his qualities.

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.439
He wasn't shy about asking Jehovah questions.

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:02.400
The watchtower once said,

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:09.680
knowing Jehovah will reward an inquiring mind in ways that no other information can.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.280
Isn't that beautiful?

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.479
So if we want to know Jehovah better,

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:19.680
we have to be careful not to let our upbringing, education,

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.199
responsibilities dull our curiosity.

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:26.479
Be more observant like Moses was,

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:29.199
and learn to ask Jehovah sincere questions.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.280
Our curiosity will draw us irresistibly closer to Jehovah.

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.520
Step number two is to be more open-minded.

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:42.400
Moses wasn't dogmatic.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.159
He was open to whatever Jehovah would reveal about himself.

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:52.400
And this open-mindedness allowed their relationship to go to another level.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.159
Let's look at another example.

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:58.080
Open your Bibles again with me this time to Exodus,

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.400
Chapter 24.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.960
And here, Jehovah invites Moses, Aaron,

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:08.159
Aaron's two sons, and seventy of the older men,

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:11.039
to approach Mount Sinai.

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:13.120
Now notice what happens next in verse 10.

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:17.860
And they saw the God of Israel.

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:22.660
Under his feet was what seemed like a sapphire pavement,

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.459
and it was as pure as the heavens themselves.

00:04:26.339 --> 00:04:29.300
He did not harm the distinguished men of Israel,

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.699
and they saw a vision of the true God and ate and drank.

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:36.420
What an amazing experience that was.

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:41.139
It is one of only a very few occasions in the Bible

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:44.740
where humans were privileged to see a vision of Jehovah's glory.

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:47.540
Who could forget something like that?

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:49.860
But what happens?

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:52.420
Seven days later,

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:55.379
Jehovah calls Moses back up into the mountain.

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:57.779
He's there for 40 days and 40 nights,

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.060
while Aaron and the elder stay behind.

00:05:02.019 --> 00:05:05.779
A few weeks pass, and while Moses is learning more

00:05:05.779 --> 00:05:07.540
about Jehovah on the mountain,

00:05:08.259 --> 00:05:12.579
the people convince Aaron and the older men to make a golden calf.

00:05:14.019 --> 00:05:17.779
How could this have happened after seeing that divine vision?

00:05:18.899 --> 00:05:20.500
What were these older men thinking?

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:24.019
While insight on the scriptures explains,

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:30.339
though Jehovah instructed the Israelites to throw away the dungy idols of Egypt,

00:05:30.899 --> 00:05:32.019
they failed to do so.

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:37.060
The making of a golden calfer worship likely reflects

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:42.500
the Egyptian animal worship that had infected some Israelites.

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:47.459
Idols and images are a snare,

00:05:47.459 --> 00:05:49.939
whether they're physical or mental.

00:05:50.899 --> 00:05:55.459
To really know Jehovah, we have to be open-minded.

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.420
All too often, we project our own opinions, biases,

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:02.579
preconceptions on others.

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:08.500
We have our pet ideas, our cherished interpretations,

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:15.300
and personal sensitivities that were instilled in us by our parents or education or culture.

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:18.740
We may not even be aware that they're there.

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:24.980
But we can't make Jehovah into who we think he is.

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:29.939
We have to let go of those preconceived notions that may be keeping us from

00:06:29.939 --> 00:06:37.139
discovering who he really is, which leads us to step three, show more courage.

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:46.019
Moses often shows experiences where he could do things together with Jehovah.

00:06:46.019 --> 00:06:48.259
He didn't let his fears hold him back.

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:55.620
Those who did lost out on wonderful opportunities to get to know Jehovah better.

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:57.540
Let's look at one more example of this.

00:06:58.259 --> 00:07:03.860
Open your Bibles this time to Exodus 20 and we'll read together verse 19

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:11.350
after the awe-inspiring demonstration of Jehovah's power at Mount Sinai.

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:15.189
Notice what the people say to Moses here in verse 19.

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:21.379
You speak with us, and we will listen.

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:27.300
But do not let God speak with us for fear that we may die.

00:07:29.379 --> 00:07:30.980
The people are afraid.

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:32.740
Moses tries to encourage them.

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:35.939
He tells them in the next verse, don't be afraid.

00:07:35.939 --> 00:07:37.860
Jehovah's just testing you.

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:40.980
This is a wonderful opportunity to get to know him better.

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:43.860
But the people don't get it.

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:48.100
Verse 21 says they kept standing at a distance.

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:50.259
But what about Moses?

00:07:51.699 --> 00:07:56.500
That verse says he went near to the dark cloud where the true God was.

00:07:56.899 --> 00:07:59.779
He may have been a little scared too.

00:07:59.779 --> 00:08:01.540
It took courage to do that.

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:04.500
But he wanted to spend more time with Jehovah.

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:10.180
In fact, at Jehovah's invitation, he later goes right on up into the mountain,

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:17.220
into those clouds, and twice spends 40 days and 40 nights listening and talking with God.

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:20.819
Can you imagine what an experience that was?

00:08:20.819 --> 00:08:22.980
Maybe he'll tell us more about it in the new world.

00:08:23.699 --> 00:08:29.379
How sad though that the other Israelites missed out on that opportunity.

00:08:30.579 --> 00:08:34.500
Who knows how that experience might have strengthened their faith?

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:39.220
Instead, the majority never made it into the promised land.

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:43.460
They died in the wilderness because of a lack of faith.

00:08:45.059 --> 00:08:50.340
One scholarly reference on Exodus 6, 2 and 3 says this,

00:08:50.419 --> 00:08:57.460
to know Jehovah's name is something very different from knowing the four letters of which it

00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:07.059
is composed. It is to know by experience that Jehovah really is what his name declares him to be.

00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:11.620
Well, our situation today is similar to the Israelites.

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:19.940
Every day consciously or unconsciously, we make choices about how we will spend our time and who

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:24.740
we will spend our time with. Choose wisely, brothers and sisters.

00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:31.860
Whenever you have the opportunity to do something with Jehovah, don't hesitate. Just do it.

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:36.500
It takes strong faith to get to know Jehovah well.

00:09:37.779 --> 00:09:44.179
We need to ask him more questions. We need to be willing to discover who he really is.

00:09:45.139 --> 00:09:52.179
And we need to overcome our fear or we'll end up missing out on opportunities to get to know him better.

00:09:53.700 --> 00:10:01.379
Moses got so close to Jehovah the Bible says that it was as if he could see the one who is invisible.

00:10:02.259 --> 00:10:07.139
Perhaps no one on earth before Jesus had a closer relationship with God.

00:10:08.259 --> 00:10:13.539
Well, you can draw closer to Jehovah too and he will take steps to draw closer to you

00:10:13.539 --> 00:10:21.460
if you earnestly seek him. Just like Edward and Gwen built a loving and enduring

00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:27.139
marriage by noticing, thinking about and enjoying the company of each other,

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:35.940
we can get to know Jehovah better by being more curious, more open-minded and showing more courage.
