00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:08.039
Welcome to the December 2024 edition of J.W. Broadcasting.

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:33.409
The 144th annual meeting of the Watchtower Bible and Trek Society of Pennsylvania

00:00:33.409 --> 00:00:38.409
was held on October 5, 2024.

00:00:38.409 --> 00:00:43.409
The program featured encouraging spiritual talks and videos.

00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:48.409
Please enjoy the first part of the annual meeting.

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:52.409
So what an eventful year it has been.

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:55.409
As expressed at Psalm 65 verse 11,

00:00:55.409 --> 00:01:01.409
Jehovah has indeed crowned the year with goodness in a spiritual sense.

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:06.409
Since our last annual meeting, Jehovah has directed his people in many different ways,

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:08.409
reflecting his love and wisdom.

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:14.409
Of course, the most significant occurrence is that we've welcomed back thousands

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:17.409
who had been removed from the congregation.

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:23.409
And certainly there has been great joy in heaven, but here on earth as well.

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:26.409
We're delighted to have these dear ones back with us once again.

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:41.019
Wouldn't you agree?

00:01:41.019 --> 00:01:44.019
Also, we were thrilled by this year's conventions,

00:01:44.019 --> 00:01:49.019
featuring the good news according to Jesus, as we saw in the video Prelude.

00:01:49.019 --> 00:01:53.019
And we just completed a global campaign to start Bible studies.

00:01:53.019 --> 00:01:58.019
We see the growth that's taking place in the field.

00:01:58.019 --> 00:02:03.019
And in other news, there's a new product in the Bethel Commissary, beard butter.

00:02:03.019 --> 00:02:09.460
Not to be confused with the butter that you spread on your toast.

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:15.460
Yes, adjustments to our dress and grooming were also a highlight of the year.

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.460
Additionally, less than a year ago, the PVC opened for tours.

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:25.770
Not to be confused with polyvinyl chloride for all you plumbers out there.

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.770
No, we're talking about the PVC, the Patterson Visitors Center.

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.770
Here's an experience from the first century village.

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:40.770
A young girl was very impressed by the village and was trying to just understand, comprehend what she was seeing around her.

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.770
She noticed all the costume, detentance, walking around, demonstrating trades.

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.770
Or just speaking with the visitors, she asked her mother,

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.770
are these resurrected ones?

00:02:51.770 --> 00:03:02.539
A young boy about 10 was with his family and enjoyed seeing a brother in costume demonstrating the wine press.

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:07.539
Well, the family continued walking through the marketplace and then into the courtyard.

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:10.539
But the little boy kept coming back. He kept coming back to the wine press.

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:14.539
And the costume detentant told him, you must really enjoy it here.

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:21.539
And he said, yes, then the boy paused and he said, I'm from the future.

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:39.629
He went on to show his phone to the attendant and show how he has the Bible on it.

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:48.629
The attendant explained, he'd seen others come through the village with such devices, but he only reads Hebrew.

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:54.629
The young brother looked at him and said, I have the Bible in many languages.

00:03:54.629 --> 00:04:00.629
So the young brother put himself into the spirit of the time period and was quite affected by the impact of the Bible village.

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:04.629
So no doubt you too will enjoy your tour if you haven't already gone.

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:09.629
Even if it's a return visit, you'll still be delighted to see people from the first century.

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:15.879
Now, in years gone by, brother Russell Kerzen, many of you remember him.

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:24.879
He was sort of like the Bethel historian because he would relate specific events that occurred on that day to the morning worship chairman

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:28.879
who often would share them then with the Bethel family.

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:32.879
Well, today is October 5th.

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:34.879
So put on your thinking caps for a moment.

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:42.160
What note were the events in history have occurred on October 5th?

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:47.160
Does Mini, Mini, Tickle and Parsons ring a bell?

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:58.160
Yes, the handwriting on the wall appeared in Bell Shazard's palace on October 5th, 539 BCE, according to the Gregorian calendar.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.160
But what about in our common era?

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:13.160
In the month of October 1924, Jehovah's people were busy distributing around the world a printed resolution entitled Ecclesiastics Indicted.

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:17.160
Now, this is a copy of that tract, life size.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:22.160
Imagine distributing this tract to people in your territory or putting it in their doors.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:27.699
The introduction to the resolution stated the following.

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:32.699
The indictment herein is laid chiefly against the clergy.

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:46.699
Showing that they have fallen before the temptations of Satan proved unfaithful to the Lord and to the responsibility resting upon them, and that this is the chief cause of the world's present deplorable state.

00:05:46.699 --> 00:05:51.699
Strong words from the organization back in 1924.

00:05:51.699 --> 00:05:55.699
Point number three of the resolution stated this.

00:05:55.699 --> 00:06:06.699
That they, the clergy, have failed and refused to preach to the people the message of Messiah's kingdom and to point them to the evidences relating to his second presence.

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:21.699
And being unwilling to wait the Lord's due time to set up his kingdom and being ambitious to appear wise and great they have together with their co-conspirators claimed the ability to set up God's kingdom on earth without God.

00:06:21.699 --> 00:06:28.699
And have endorsed the League of Nations and declared it to be the political expression of God's kingdom on earth.

00:06:28.699 --> 00:06:37.699
They're by breaking their allegiance to the Lord Jesus Christ and declaring their allegiance to the devil, the God of evil.

00:06:37.699 --> 00:06:46.420
And to this end, they have advocated and sanctified war, turned their church edifices into recruiting stations.

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:49.420
Does that sound like any of the churches in modern times?

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:57.420
Acted as recruiting officers for pay and preached men into the trenches there to suffer and die.

00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:03.420
Quite a resolution ecclesiastics indicted.

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:09.420
Nothing has changed. The clergy still teach lies, foment war, and failed to preach the good news.

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:13.420
They're still riding on the back of the beast, too.

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:19.420
Well, back in 1924, is reported in the October 2024 study edition of the watchtower.

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:30.420
In the small town of Cleveland, Oklahoma, brother Frank Johnson finished distributing the tracks 20 minutes before he was to be picked up by other publishers.

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:37.420
Well, he couldn't just wait out in the open because men from the town were angered and they were seeking to find him.

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:42.420
So, brother Johnson decided to hide in a nearby church.

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:51.420
Finding it empty, he left copy of ecclesiastics indicted in the preacher's Bible and at each seat.

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:59.420
He exited the churches quickly as he had come. Well, he still had some time, so he visited two more churches following a similar pattern.

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:02.420
Frank rushed back to the spot where he was to be picked up.

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:06.420
He hid behind a fuel station, keeping an eye out for the men who were with him.

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:15.420
The men drove by but they didn't see him. As soon as they were gone, Frank's fellow preachers who had been witnessing nearby arrived to pick him up and they all drove off together.

00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:22.420
Now, as they were leaving town, one of the brothers recalled, we passed by the three churches.

00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:26.420
There were as many as 50 people standing out in front of each church.

00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:30.420
Some of the people were reading the track, others were holding it up for the preacher to see.

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:39.419
Well, we had a very close call, he said, but we thanked Jehovah our God for his protection and the knowledge to outwit these enemies of the kingdom.

00:08:39.419 --> 00:08:52.419
So, that's part of our theocratic history. Your theocratic history, you continue to preach with the same boldness. Those were exciting times, but we too are living and exciting times.

00:08:52.419 --> 00:09:05.419
On October 5th, 2002, it was announced at the annual meeting that printing operations in the United States would be moved from Brooklyn to Walkill.

00:09:05.419 --> 00:09:07.419
Amazing.

00:09:07.419 --> 00:09:11.419
October 5th, 2013, what happened?

00:09:11.419 --> 00:09:19.419
Likely, you recall Brother Jackson released the revised New World Translation in English. Amazing.

00:09:19.419 --> 00:09:23.419
October 5th, 2019, what happened?

00:09:23.419 --> 00:09:31.419
The Ramapo project was announced. Amazing. Jehovah continues to bless his organization.

00:09:31.419 --> 00:09:34.419
Well, what will we hear today?

00:09:34.419 --> 00:09:44.419
Calls to action, kind reminders, exciting announcements, praise to Jehovah?

00:09:44.419 --> 00:09:49.419
Absolutely. And a few surprises along the way, so don't change the channel.

00:09:49.419 --> 00:10:00.179
Ten years ago, at the annual meeting of 2014, we were introduced to the first epic episode of the series Become Jehovah's Friend.

00:10:00.179 --> 00:10:05.179
And it was entitled, Jehovah will help you be bold.

00:10:05.179 --> 00:10:12.179
Since that time, five additional epic episodes have been released, including Make Jehovah Happy.

00:10:12.179 --> 00:10:19.179
Jehovah forgives. Does Jehovah answer prayers? Who should be my friend and you are precious to Jehovah?

00:10:19.179 --> 00:10:27.179
How these videos have helped our young ones and really all of us to visualize Bible accounts and heavenly realities?

00:10:27.179 --> 00:10:34.179
Well, we're happy to inform you that another epic episode will soon be ready for release, but not just yet.

00:10:34.179 --> 00:10:41.179
But we can show you the trailer to increase anticipation. Its entitled Become Jehovah's Friend, The Greatest Act of Love.

00:10:41.179 --> 00:10:43.179
Let's watch.

00:10:43.179 --> 00:10:59.419
I miss her so much. Hey, soon we're having a memorial. And you have to come. It's the most important event.

00:10:59.419 --> 00:11:05.779
He loves all of us. He loves you.

00:11:05.779 --> 00:11:12.779
Soon, Jesus will resurrect people. And because he died for us, we can only live forever.

00:11:12.779 --> 00:11:15.779
He's the greatest gift anyone could give us.

00:11:15.779 --> 00:11:18.779
Mom, should we get ready for the memorial?

00:11:18.779 --> 00:11:21.779
Let's do it. Yay!

00:11:21.779 --> 00:11:51.000
As we all go home tonight, think about what Jesus' sacrifice means to you.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000
Certainly, we anticipate the release of the full length episode.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:00.000
Well, the next part of our program is a symposium from three members of the governing body.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
Each speaker will introduce the next.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:10.000
But the first talk of our symposium will be given by the longest serving member of the governing body, Brother Garrett Lush.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:15.000
The past July, he completed 30 years serving on the governing body.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:20.000
Brother Lush will now discuss the theme, Our Privilege, to glorify Jehovah.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:31.389
As you can see, this is Amira.

00:12:31.389 --> 00:12:40.870
Did you look into Amira before you came here?

00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:47.870
Perhaps judging by your neat and clean appearance, you obviously did.

00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:55.870
Ancient mirrors were generally made of metal, such as bronze or copper, even silver and gold.

00:12:55.870 --> 00:13:05.870
They had to be highly polished, but still did not have as fine reflecting surface as do glass mirrors.

00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:11.870
This is why the Apostle Paul said in 1 Corinthians 13-12,

00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:19.870
for now we see an easy outline by means of the metal mirror.

00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:26.870
Probably only in the first century, gas mirrors were introduced.

00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:34.870
In the scriptures, we find two figurative uses of the term mirror.

00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:41.870
For instance, in James, chapter 1, verses 22 to 25, it says,

00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:49.870
however, become doers of the word and not heroes only, deceiving yourselves with false reasoning.

00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:58.870
For if anyone is a hero of the word and not a doer, this is like a man looking at his own face in Amira,

00:13:58.870 --> 00:14:07.120
for he looks at himself and he goes away and immediately forgets what sort of person he is.

00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:16.120
The one who peers into the perfect law that belongs to freedom and continues in it has become not a forgetful hero,

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:24.750
but a doer of the work, and he will be happy in what he does.

00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:35.750
And the Apostle Paul showed that Christians reflect like mirrors the glory of Jehovah in their ministry.

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:41.750
In chapter 3, he wrote chapter 3 and verse 18,

00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:55.779
and all of us, while we with unveiled faces, reflect like mirrors the glory of Jehovah,

00:14:55.779 --> 00:15:05.779
but transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another, exactly as it's done by Jehovah the Spirit.

00:15:05.779 --> 00:15:17.779
And in chapter 6, verse 1, he says, therefore, since we have this ministry through the mercy that was shown us, we do not give up.

00:15:17.779 --> 00:15:26.779
So God's word is compared to a mirror that we can use to examine ourselves.

00:15:26.779 --> 00:15:36.779
On the other hand, also Christians themselves are compared to a mirror, a mirror that reflects Jehovah's glory.

00:15:36.779 --> 00:15:40.779
So how do the Scriptures use the word glory?

00:15:40.779 --> 00:15:46.159
Well, there are different types of glory.

00:15:46.159 --> 00:15:56.159
In 1 Corinthians chapter 15, verses 40 to 44, it says, and there are heavenly bodies and earthly bodies,

00:15:56.159 --> 00:16:03.159
but the glory of the heavenly bodies is one sort, and that of the earthly bodies is a different sort.

00:16:03.159 --> 00:16:10.159
The glory of the sun is one sort, the glory of the moon is another, and the glory of the stars is another.

00:16:10.159 --> 00:16:17.159
In fact, star differs from another star in glory, so it is with a resurrection of the dead.

00:16:17.159 --> 00:16:21.159
It is shown in corruption, it's raised up in corruption.

00:16:21.159 --> 00:16:25.159
It's shown in dishonor, it's raised up in glory.

00:16:25.159 --> 00:16:30.159
It's shown in weakness, it's raised up in power.

00:16:30.159 --> 00:16:35.159
It's shown a physical body, it's raised up a spiritual body.

00:16:37.889 --> 00:16:42.889
Now, let's discuss five types of glory.

00:16:42.889 --> 00:16:48.889
Of course, Jehovah has and deserves the highest degree of glory.

00:16:48.889 --> 00:16:55.889
Then there's the glory of Jesus, which is second to the one of God.

00:16:55.889 --> 00:17:03.889
In John 1, 14, it says, so the word became flesh and resided among us, and we had the view of His glory.

00:17:03.889 --> 00:17:13.890
A glory that such as belongs to an only begotten son from the Father, and He was full of divine favor and truth.

00:17:13.890 --> 00:17:15.890
John 1, 14.

00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:25.200
The Bible shows that Jesus was given more glory after His resurrection than He had before He came to the earth.

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:34.200
It says, Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels, now crowned with glory,

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:37.200
and honor for having suffered death.

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:40.200
Hebrews 2 verse 9.

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:47.200
The third point, anointed Christians also have a measure of glory.

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:56.200
Jude 8 says that in the first century there were some that were speaking abusively of glorious ones.

00:17:56.200 --> 00:18:00.200
Who were the glorious ones in the first century?

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:03.200
Anointed overseers.

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:08.200
They had a measure of glory when they lived on earth.

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:10.200
Number 4.

00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:13.200
When taken to heaven, all anointed.

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:18.200
Not only anointed overseers will receive everlasting glory.

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:21.200
Second Timothy 2 10 says, quote,

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:27.200
For this reason I go on enduring all things for the sake of the chosen ones,

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:37.480
so that they too may obtain the salvation that is through Christ Jesus along with everlasting glory.

00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:44.480
But we have today not a few, but many glorious ones sitting even in the audience right here.

00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:46.480
How so?

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:53.480
Because the expression glorious ones refers also to elders with an earthly hope.

00:18:53.480 --> 00:19:04.480
The watchdog in 1997, September 1, page 16 verse 14 says, quote,

00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:09.480
Christian elders represent the glorious Jehovah God and His Son,

00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:15.480
and as a result have certain glory conferred upon them.

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:19.480
True, they make mistakes as did Peter himself,

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:27.480
but the Scriptures urged members of the congregation to be submissive to such glorious ones.

00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:29.480
End of quote.

00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:32.480
And number 5.

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:37.480
There's the glorious good news, no matter what hope we have.

00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:42.480
We glorify Jehovah through our preaching and teaching.

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:49.480
Second Corinthians 4, 3, and 4 says, in fact, the good news we declare is veiled.

00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:54.480
It is veiled among those who are perishing among the God over the system of things,

00:19:54.480 --> 00:20:06.660
has blinded the minds of the unbelievers so that the illumination of the glorious good news about the Christ might not shine through.

00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:10.660
How can we all glorify Jehovah?

00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:16.660
Not only overseers and other adults in the congregation reflect Jehovah's glory,

00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:20.660
also children can do so.

00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:24.660
Children, are you aware of it?

00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:29.660
You too, yes, we all can glorify Jehovah.

00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:33.660
How? In at least six ways.

00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:41.660
For starting with 1.1, we glorify Him through our prayers,

00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:46.660
and then also by singing kingdom songs.

00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:52.660
Another point, we glorify Him by accumulating accurate knowledge.

00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:56.660
Second Corinthians 4.6 therefore says,

00:20:56.660 --> 00:21:00.660
for God is the one who said, let the light shine out of darkness,

00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:10.660
and He is shown on our hearts to illuminate them with the glorious knowledge of God by the face of Christ.

00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:15.660
Further, we glorify Jehovah by our Christian conduct.

00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:19.660
Yes, we absorb this light of glorious knowledge of God,

00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:25.660
and transform our lives according to it, it brings glory to Jehovah God.

00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:30.660
Once conduct can cause also others to give glory to God.

00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:36.660
Our conduct is not perfect, we all know that, still Jehovah accepts us.

00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:46.660
However, that does not excuse us from keeping ourselves as mirrors in a clean and polished shape as much as we can.

00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:54.660
In the dark, no mirror reflects anything except darkness.

00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:59.660
A mirror does not have any glory or light in itself.

00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:08.660
Similarly, we are aware that any glory we might have is just a reflection of God's glory.

00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:12.660
First Peter chapter 12 says,

00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:19.660
maintain your conduct fine among the nations so that when they accuse you of being wrongdoers,

00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:22.660
they may be eyewitnesses of your fine works.

00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:30.609
And as a result, glorify God in the day of His inspection.

00:22:30.609 --> 00:22:35.609
Further, we glorify Him by doing good to others.

00:22:35.609 --> 00:22:45.609
In Matthew 516, in the sermon on the Mount, Jesus Himself showed that preaching and teaching is not enough.

00:22:45.609 --> 00:22:49.609
We need to do good things to others, aside from it.

00:22:49.609 --> 00:22:54.609
We need to love our neighbors, including those in our workplace.

00:22:54.609 --> 00:23:02.609
This may prompt people who are not witnesses of Jehovah to glorify God as Jesus put it.

00:23:02.609 --> 00:23:10.609
And I quote, let your light shine before me so that they may see you of fine works.

00:23:10.609 --> 00:23:17.609
So it's not just preaching, fine works, and give glory to your father who is in the heavens.

00:23:17.609 --> 00:23:26.500
What's another way we all can reflect the glory of Jehovah like mirrors?

00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:29.500
We glorify Him by our preaching and teaching.

00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:38.500
We want to conduct many Bible studies and want to impart the glorious knowledge of God to others.

00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:41.500
For God is the one who said, let the light shine out of darkness.

00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:48.500
And He has shown on our hearts to illuminate them, says Paul in 2 Corinthians 4, 6.

00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:56.500
And He continues, illuminate them with the glorious knowledge of God by the face of Christ.

00:23:57.500 --> 00:24:05.500
Many of us who are older had the privilege of reflecting the glory of Jehovah for perhaps decades.

00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:16.500
Jehovah has allowed us not only the privilege of proclaiming the message of the kingdom but also some have served as elders, pioneers, missionaries,

00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:22.500
Bethelites, construction servants, circuit overseers or branch committee members.

00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:28.500
These are ways that we have reflected the glory of Jehovah.

00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:32.500
What a privilege we've had to do so, haven't we?

00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:37.500
In spite of all these privileges, we maintain a humble spirit.

00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:44.500
We appreciate that the privileges we have enjoyed are an undeserved kindness from Jehovah.

00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:52.500
Having enjoyed so many privileges, what unique responsibility do we as older ones now have?

00:24:52.500 --> 00:25:01.500
We must allow the next generation to come up so they too can enjoy unique privileges in glorifying Jehovah.

00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:12.500
They are the next generation of like circuit overseers, Bethelites, missionaries, construction servants, branch committee members and so on.

00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:19.500
We want them to have the marvelous privilege that we have enjoyed as well.

00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:34.500
That means we must look for ways to teach them, to train them, to encourage them so that they may use their youth and strength and ability to glorify Jehovah.

00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:42.099
What a privilege we have is older ones to train and teach younger ones.

00:25:42.099 --> 00:25:55.099
With that in mind, it is a pleasure to announce that two additional brothers have been appointed to serve as members of the governing body.

00:25:55.099 --> 00:26:13.660
Well, brothers, brothers of Jody, Jedily and Jacob Rump.

00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:20.660
Both brothers are anointed Christians who have a long history of loyal service to Jehovah.

00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:27.660
Brother Jedily began his full-time service in 1989 and Bethel service in 1990.

00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:33.660
Brother Rump began his full-time service in 1995 and Bethel service in 2020.

00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:39.660
Both brothers served as helpers to the service committee of the governing body for a while.

00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:46.660
We thank our Heavenly Father Jehovah for raising up such faithful men to share in the work of the governing body.

00:26:46.660 --> 00:27:05.019
We pray that Jehovah will reachly bless brothers Jedily and Rump and their wives.

00:27:05.019 --> 00:27:09.019
We all worship our glorious God, Jehovah.

00:27:09.019 --> 00:27:12.019
We have the glorious good news to spread.

00:27:12.019 --> 00:27:17.019
Our whole life is for the glory of His praise.

00:27:17.019 --> 00:27:28.019
Paul wrote in 1 Corinthians 1031, whether you are eating or drinking or doing anything else, do all things for God's glory.

00:27:29.019 --> 00:27:39.019
Will you endeavor to reflect like a mirror Jehovah's glory by making the truth manifest in word and example?

00:27:39.019 --> 00:27:41.019
What a privilege.

00:27:41.019 --> 00:27:53.019
At the end of the millennium, faithful ones on earth will receive and display a measure of glory as perfect sons and daughters of Jehovah.

00:27:54.019 --> 00:28:08.019
It says in Romans 821, the creation itself will also be set free from enslavement to corruption and have the glorious freedom of the children of God.

00:28:08.019 --> 00:28:12.019
So keep polishing that mirror.

00:28:12.019 --> 00:28:22.019
Look at the mirror of God's word every day and like a mirror reflect God's glory by what you say and do.

00:28:22.019 --> 00:28:29.019
Appreciate your privilege to glorify Jehovah God, help young ones to take on privileges of service.

00:28:29.019 --> 00:28:35.019
We trust your will and we wish you Jehovah's rich blessing in this endeavor.

00:28:35.019 --> 00:28:59.279
So keep polishing, keep reflecting the light.

00:28:59.279 --> 00:29:09.279
But how can you, our young ones, glorify Jehovah by serving, for instance, at Bethel and in theocratic construction?

00:29:09.279 --> 00:29:14.279
What opportunities are available for younger ones today?

00:29:14.279 --> 00:29:33.279
For the answers to these questions, let us now give our attention to Brother Jeffrey Winder, a member of the governing body who will share the next talk in this symposium entitled Opportunities to glorify Jehovah at Bethel and in theocratic construction.

00:29:33.279 --> 00:29:48.579
Over 2,700 years ago, Jehovah God inspired the faithful man Isaiah to utter a prophecy that you and I are seeing fulfilled before our eyes.

00:29:48.579 --> 00:30:01.619
It's found in Isaiah chapter 60. I invite you to turn there with me. Isaiah 60 and let's read together verse 22.

00:30:01.619 --> 00:30:12.210
That verse says, the little one will become a thousand and the small one, a mighty nation.

00:30:12.210 --> 00:30:24.579
I myself Jehovah will speed it up in its own time, like passengers in a car that is increasing in speed.

00:30:24.579 --> 00:30:29.579
Do you sense the momentum of what Jehovah's organization is doing today?

00:30:29.579 --> 00:30:46.259
Jehovah is accomplishing a tremendous work worldwide and all in connection with the kingdom preaching work.

00:30:46.259 --> 00:30:55.259
And in the face of satanic attack and the wickedness of the last days, what Jehovah is accomplishing truly glorifies his name.

00:30:55.259 --> 00:31:03.730
But because so much work is being done, there is a need for more workers to keep up with this work.

00:31:03.730 --> 00:31:11.730
And in this talk, we're specifically going to talk about the needs at Bethel and in theocratic construction.

00:31:11.730 --> 00:31:24.730
Well, what is the need? In Bethel, we have a constant need for spiritually qualified men and women who can help carry the load of the ever increasing and complex work.

00:31:24.730 --> 00:31:43.730
And there is a particular need for young brothers who can apply to come to Bethel and be trained and in time qualified to serve as overseers or to take the lead in departments such as the service department or public information department, hospital information department and many others.

00:31:43.730 --> 00:31:50.730
We need brothers who can in time qualify to serve on branch committees.

00:31:50.730 --> 00:32:02.730
And even in branches where the Bethel family is small, we need young brothers to apply because the brothers and sisters who have been carrying the load for years, we love them, but they're getting older.

00:32:02.730 --> 00:32:09.730
And they have a zeal for the work, but they recognize the need to train others so that Jehovah's work can continue.

00:32:12.140 --> 00:32:27.140
And what about theocratic construction? Well, there too, there continues to be a need for spiritually qualified men and women who can help carry the tremendous amount of work that is taking place and facility construction worldwide.

00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:39.140
And there too, we need spiritually qualified men who can be trained in time to take the lead as trade overseers to serve as construction committee members and care for other assignments.

00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:51.140
But how much work is there to do in theocratic construction? Just to give you a glimpse, consider some of the needs for kingdom halls in a few countries in Africa.

00:32:51.140 --> 00:33:03.140
Congo reports a deficit of nearly 1900 new kingdom halls. Zambia reports a need for over 900 new kingdom halls.

00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:16.140
Mozambique and Angola each have a need for almost 500 kingdom halls. In a Nigeria, they have on their books a need for 2000 renovations of kingdom halls in addition to the new ones that they need.

00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:27.140
And that's not to mention all the work taking place and major branch construction, the construction of remote translation offices, school facilities, assembly halls, and more.

00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:42.140
Is there a need? Absolutely. Young ones, especially you young ones in your teens thinking about how you will use your life, can you get involved in the Bethel work and theocratic construction work?

00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:51.140
Should you? If you do, what will your life be like? Would you live to regret it?

00:33:51.140 --> 00:33:58.140
Or is it possible that it would lead to a most fulfilling life in this system of things?

00:33:58.140 --> 00:34:11.139
Well, to help answer those questions, we invite you to watch the following video, which highlights comments from ones who, when they were young, made the decision to get involved in Bethel work or theocratic construction work.

00:34:11.139 --> 00:34:23.139
Watching this video could be like looking at your life in fast forward. If you choose the course that these ones chose, how would that turn out for you?

00:34:23.139 --> 00:34:24.139
Let's watch.

00:34:24.139 --> 00:34:44.199
My name is Pavel. I serve at the Finland branch.

00:34:44.199 --> 00:34:48.199
My name is Brad Berkwin. I'm serving in the Congo.

00:34:48.199 --> 00:34:50.199
My name is Gina Slay.

00:34:50.199 --> 00:34:55.199
My name is Christopher Slay. And we serve in the Nigeria branch.

00:34:55.199 --> 00:34:58.199
My name is Karen Ferro. I live in Argentina.

00:34:58.199 --> 00:35:06.199
I grew up in a sign language congregation because I have deaf parents. And when I saw the sign language department for the first time, I was so impressed by it.

00:35:06.199 --> 00:35:11.199
And so I developed my first love for Bethel's service.

00:35:11.199 --> 00:35:20.199
As a young man, there was a lot of discussions with my father. He wanted really what amounted to a normal life in this system.

00:35:20.199 --> 00:35:30.199
I think the contrast for me was the joy of being a fellow worker with Jehovah in the preaching work and just to feel that close friendship with him.

00:35:30.199 --> 00:35:37.199
I drifted from my goal and from serving Jehovah because I didn't have friends in the congregation. I only had friends in school.

00:35:37.199 --> 00:35:45.199
I said, Jehovah, I want to start serving you. I want to give you my all. But tell me how. Give me a kick.

00:35:45.199 --> 00:35:51.199
The first step I took to be able to serve was when I was 18. I filled out a form to make myself available.

00:35:51.199 --> 00:35:58.199
There was a construction project in my circuit. So with my older sister and two friends, we started to work there.

00:35:58.199 --> 00:36:02.199
It was relatively near us, so we supported the whole project.

00:36:02.199 --> 00:36:11.199
I would say getting closer to happy pioneers. I realized I was in the truth. They are in the truth, but they are happier than me.

00:36:11.199 --> 00:36:15.199
So I started regular auxiliary pioneering, then regular pioneering.

00:36:15.199 --> 00:36:22.199
In our congregation, there was a special pioneer couple. Before that, they served at Bethel and therefore they had a lot of experience.

00:36:22.199 --> 00:36:27.199
I asked them questions, so I want to serve in Bethel. What do I need to do? Tell me.

00:36:27.199 --> 00:36:41.610
When I thought of Bethel, I knew single sisters were serving there. When I became aware of the construction work, I made myself available to increase my service.

00:36:41.610 --> 00:36:51.610
Serving Jehovah, as full as you can, is not a matter of just drudgery and sacrifices in this system.

00:36:51.610 --> 00:36:55.610
It's actually the best way of life we can live right now.

00:36:55.610 --> 00:37:01.610
Taste and see that Jehovah is good. That will not fail.

00:37:01.610 --> 00:37:08.610
Be constantly active in serving Jehovah. Sometimes it may seem that it's not much fun.

00:37:09.610 --> 00:37:17.610
Perhaps it may seem boring. But actually, serving Jehovah brings so much joy and many blessings.

00:37:17.610 --> 00:37:27.610
At Genesis 48-15, there it refers to Jehovah as being the true God who has been shepherding me during all my life until this day.

00:37:27.610 --> 00:37:34.610
Jacob realized that Jehovah had taken him to a spiritual place that he would never have been able to go to on his own.

00:37:34.610 --> 00:37:37.610
And I feel that Jehovah has done that with me.

00:37:37.610 --> 00:37:59.260
These friends are serving all over the globe, aren't they? Some in their home ranch territories, others in foreign assignments.

00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:12.260
But how did they describe their life? Was it drudgery and sacrifice and regret? No. Each one of them in one way or another said it is the best way of life that they could live.

00:38:12.260 --> 00:38:19.260
And didn't you love what Karen said? Jehovah can take you to a spiritual place that you could never get to on your own.

00:38:20.260 --> 00:38:25.260
Why do these ones find so much joy in their service?

00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:31.260
Well, one reason is because they know they are filling a clear need in Jehovah's work.

00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:40.260
And in this way, they're working shoulder to shoulder with God and Christ in a work that is important to them. And that brings meaning to their life.

00:38:41.260 --> 00:38:46.260
A second reason why they find so much joy is highlighted for us in the book of Psalms.

00:38:46.260 --> 00:38:55.760
I invite you to turn with me, please, to Psalm 145. And let's read together Psalm 145 in verse 2.

00:38:58.960 --> 00:39:07.960
That verse says, all day long, I will praise you. I will praise your name forever and ever.

00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:19.960
In Bethel and theocratic construction assignments, you have the opportunity to serve Jehovah all day, every day to praise Jehovah, to glorify him with all your strength.

00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:28.960
So all day of every day of your life, you are engaged in theocratic activities. And that brings contentment and joy as well.

00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:43.960
Did you notice how each one of them got started? In many cases, it was someone else in the congregation or in the circuit that encouraged them to get involved in local projects, to turn in their application and then their journey just continued from there.

00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:51.960
Well, young brothers and sisters, we want you to be able to get involved in this exciting work as early as possible.

00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:59.300
And so I have an exciting announcement to read. It reads this way.

00:39:59.300 --> 00:40:13.300
We are pleased to inform you that the governing body has decided to reduce the minimum age requirement to enter Bethel service or to assist with theocratic construction projects from 19 to 18 years of age.

00:40:13.300 --> 00:40:43.639
It goes on this adjustment is effective immediately. Why the change? Here are three reasons based on Bible principles. Reason number one.

00:40:43.639 --> 00:40:58.639
Jehovah is blessing his people with growth. Paul stated in Colossians one six that the good news is bearing fruit and increasing in all the world. So it is also doing among you.

00:40:58.639 --> 00:41:06.639
Today, we are thrilled to see how the good news continues to bear fruit and how much growth is taking place.

00:41:06.639 --> 00:41:18.639
We also see Jehovah's spirit at work in you young ones and we want to open up to you the opportunity to enter special forms of service as soon as possible.

00:41:18.639 --> 00:41:29.639
Reason number two. Our current and future needs require more young brothers to make themselves available for expanded theocratic service. Why?

00:41:29.639 --> 00:41:40.639
Proverbs 2029 says that the glory of young men is their strength. There is a regular need for your help to handle important assignments.

00:41:40.639 --> 00:41:47.639
And reason number three. We want you to benefit as soon as possible from additional theocratic training.

00:41:47.639 --> 00:42:00.639
Paul said in Philippians three eight. What is more, I do indeed also consider all things to be lost on account of the excelling value of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord.

00:42:00.639 --> 00:42:13.639
Our heartfelt desire is for as many of you young ones as possible to experience the unique and special training of excelling value that is available at Bethel and on theocratic construction projects.

00:42:13.639 --> 00:42:24.639
It will accelerate your training and developing spiritual qualities equip you to handle more responsibility in the congregation and to address needs at Bethel and in the field.

00:42:24.639 --> 00:42:36.639
So young ones, we encourage you to prayerfully consider whether you can make yourself available to enjoy the special privilege of service and isn't that exciting.

00:42:36.639 --> 00:43:01.119
So truly young ones, we encourage you to take advantage of this opportunity, get glorified Jehovah by getting involved in Bethel work and theocratic construction as soon as possible.

00:43:01.119 --> 00:43:12.360
Some of you, especially you sisters, might have noticed that some of our comments were weighted more toward encouraging the young brothers to apply.

00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:20.360
And the reason for that is because of the need that we have for these brothers to take the lead and direct the work as they grow and receive training.

00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:29.360
But we would be a miss if we did not acknowledge the hard work and self-sacrifice of the young sisters in the organization.

00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:39.360
The fact is you're doing it, you're there, you are with us at Bethel, you are fully involved in theocratic construction around the world, many of you courageously accepting foreign assignments.

00:43:39.360 --> 00:44:00.179
And we truly love you for your example and your life of self-sacrifice.

00:44:00.179 --> 00:44:03.179
And now a word to the parents.

00:44:03.179 --> 00:44:11.179
We know that you parents, you love your children and you want the very best future possible for your young ones.

00:44:11.179 --> 00:44:19.179
And so we encourage you set goals of full-time service in front of your children and help them to achieve these goals.

00:44:19.179 --> 00:44:26.179
And will you miss them if they should be called to Bethel or they go off on a kingdom hall assignment somewhere, of course you will.

00:44:26.179 --> 00:44:33.179
But don't hold them back and insist that they stay home with you for fear of missing them.

00:44:33.179 --> 00:44:37.179
You may be depriving them of the most fulfilling life.

00:44:37.179 --> 00:44:40.179
But rather, can you be like Hannah?

00:44:41.179 --> 00:44:50.210
Turn with me please to 1 Samuel 1, 1 Samuel 1, 28.

00:44:50.210 --> 00:44:55.210
Jehovah blessed Hannah with his son and what did she say? What did she do?

00:44:55.210 --> 00:45:01.210
1 Samuel 1, 28, she says, I in turn now lend him to Jehovah.

00:45:01.210 --> 00:45:06.210
For all his days he is lent to Jehovah.

00:45:06.210 --> 00:45:11.210
Can you lend your son or daughter to Jehovah?

00:45:11.210 --> 00:45:16.210
Why do we say lend? It's because Jehovah will give them back to you.

00:45:16.210 --> 00:45:22.210
In the new world you will have an eternity to spend with your family together in paradise.

00:45:22.210 --> 00:45:25.210
But right now we have a work to do.

00:45:25.210 --> 00:45:32.840
So we thank you for training your young ones to take the lead in full-time service.

00:45:32.840 --> 00:45:36.840
Now a comment to our elders and circuit overseers.

00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:44.840
What can you brothers do to help the young ones on the path to serving Jehovah full-time in Bethel and in theocratic construction?

00:45:44.840 --> 00:45:47.840
Are you encouraging Bethel service?

00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:54.840
Are you helping the young ones to learn how to get involved in local projects with their local design construction department?

00:45:54.840 --> 00:45:59.840
School counselors are charting a path for our young ones in school.

00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:02.840
Shouldn't we be doing the same?

00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:07.840
To illustrate the impact that you brothers can have on the lives of these young ones.

00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:11.840
A brother that works with us at Warwick told us his experience.

00:46:11.840 --> 00:46:21.840
And he said when he was a teenager he wanted to go to Bethel but he hesitated because he wasn't sure if he could do it and he didn't know if there really was a need.

00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:31.840
But his circuit overseers saw his potential and gave him a Bethel application and persisted in encouraging him until he could see the need and he turned in his application.

00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:37.840
Well now he's been serving for some years, he's married now and he and his wife are making a fantastic contribution.

00:46:37.840 --> 00:46:45.840
But are there ones like that in your congregation, in your circuit that maybe just on the fence and would benefit from some encouragement?

00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:50.840
You can truly make a difference in how these young ones use their lives.

00:46:50.840 --> 00:47:01.469
And finally a comment to the current generation who is carrying the load of oversight in Bethel and in theocratic construction.

00:47:01.469 --> 00:47:11.469
We thank you for your years of service and to contemplate what Jehovah has been able to accomplish with your help is just fantastic.

00:47:11.469 --> 00:47:20.469
And now we thank you for training the next generation so that the work can continue and Jehovah can continue to get his work done.

00:47:20.469 --> 00:47:28.469
And we know that you desire to continue in the work. You have a zeal for the work and to feel productive and have accomplishment and feel valued.

00:47:28.469 --> 00:47:39.469
Well that's very much connected to our joy. We understand that but as we get older we know that there is a need to train the next generation so Jehovah's work can continue.

00:47:39.469 --> 00:47:46.469
And we know that you love Jehovah more than you do your personal privileges.

00:47:46.469 --> 00:47:53.469
And truly we still want you involved. The young ones need your experience and your advice.

00:47:53.469 --> 00:47:58.469
And young ones are wise to recognize how much they can benefit from your wisdom.

00:47:58.469 --> 00:48:05.469
But we thank you for being ready to hand the job to these ones and then help them to succeed.

00:48:05.469 --> 00:48:13.739
Well to conclude we'd like to just mention one more prophecy that we are seeing fulfilled before our eyes.

00:48:13.739 --> 00:48:23.369
In this case it's in the book of Psalms and we invite you to turn to the 110th Psalm.

00:48:23.369 --> 00:48:26.369
Psalm 110 in verse 3 says this.

00:48:26.369 --> 00:48:32.369
Your people will offer themselves willingly on the day of your military force.

00:48:32.369 --> 00:48:36.369
You have your company of young men just like do jobs.

00:48:36.369 --> 00:48:44.369
Well as we've discussed Jehovah is speeding up the work and so therefore there is a need for more workers.

00:48:44.369 --> 00:48:53.369
Jehovah is willing to train you and in trust you and Jehovah's organization is making arrangements for you to get involved as early as possible.

00:48:53.369 --> 00:49:02.369
Well this verse reassures us that you young ones will respond. In fact you are responding. This verse is being fulfilled.

00:49:02.369 --> 00:49:13.369
May you personally share in the fulfillment of this verse by taking advantage of opportunities to glorify Jehovah in Bethel and in theocratic construction.

00:49:13.369 --> 00:49:34.969
But Bethel and theocratic construction is only part of the work. Is there continued to be a need for more workers in the field?

00:49:34.969 --> 00:49:42.969
Well please give your attention to Brother Mark Sanderson who will speak on the theme opportunities to glorify Jehovah in the field.

00:49:43.969 --> 00:49:56.969
It was 140 years ago in 1884 when Zion's Watchtower Track Society was legally incorporated.

00:49:56.969 --> 00:50:05.969
Now I know there are many great beards here but I understand that none of you were present on that occasion.

00:50:05.969 --> 00:50:08.969
That's reassuring.

00:50:08.969 --> 00:50:18.969
It was just as Zechariah chapter 4 in verse 10 says. It was a day of small beginnings. Really just a handful.

00:50:18.969 --> 00:50:26.969
But what has Jehovah accomplished in the field in the last 140 years?

00:50:26.969 --> 00:50:39.969
Today we have nearly 9 million who are preaching the good news of God's kingdom in some 240 lands and with publications in more than 1000 languages.

00:50:39.969 --> 00:50:45.969
Brothers aren't we moved to glorify Jehovah for what he has accomplished?

00:50:45.969 --> 00:51:01.639
But how did we get to this point?

00:51:01.639 --> 00:51:09.639
And what has been a major factor in the global expansion that Jehovah's organization has experienced?

00:51:09.639 --> 00:51:18.530
And what opportunities are open in the field for our young ones? Please watch.

00:51:18.530 --> 00:51:25.530
When you think of a missionary, perhaps you think of someone older who has been preaching for many years.

00:51:25.530 --> 00:51:31.530
But of course many were very young when they started.

00:51:31.530 --> 00:51:40.530
In fact in the mid to late 1940s 30% of the missionaries sent from Gilead were under 24 years of age.

00:51:40.530 --> 00:51:49.530
They were young, energetic, full of life, willing to accept assignments around the world and they accomplished incredible things.

00:51:49.530 --> 00:51:58.530
For instance in 1943 we were preaching in 54 lands and the number of publishers was still relatively small.

00:51:58.530 --> 00:52:06.530
Jehovah blessed their hard work and zeal. In just five years the number of publishers worldwide nearly doubled.

00:52:06.530 --> 00:52:16.530
By 1953 it had doubled again and the reach of Jehovah's organization expanded to 143 lands.

00:52:16.530 --> 00:52:24.530
That 10 year burst of activity laid the foundation for Jehovah's organization to grow into what it has become today.

00:52:24.530 --> 00:52:33.530
Over 8 million people spread across 239 lands reaching billions with the truth.

00:52:33.530 --> 00:52:44.530
Young missionaries have directly contributed to the fulfillment of Jesus' words, preaching the good news of the kingdom for a witness to all the nations.

00:52:44.530 --> 00:52:53.530
But over 80 years have passed. Perhaps you're thinking. Is there still a need for missionaries today?

00:52:53.530 --> 00:53:06.260
What do the facts show? We see tremendous growth and potential for more growth around the world.

00:53:06.260 --> 00:53:17.260
What has happened just during the past service year? Mozambique had an all-time peak in memorial attendance of well over 400,000.

00:53:17.260 --> 00:53:22.260
That's more than four times the number of publishers in that land.

00:53:22.260 --> 00:53:32.260
Angola averaged over 900 new missionaries a month. Excuse me, new publishers a month. That's a lot. Wow.

00:53:32.260 --> 00:53:40.260
The Congo branch averaged more than 1300 new publishers a month.

00:53:40.260 --> 00:53:48.260
And in Philippines, on average, more than 1000 were baptized every month.

00:53:48.260 --> 00:53:57.260
Or brothers and sisters, in these places that are experiencing rapid growth, there is a huge need for more missionaries.

00:53:57.260 --> 00:54:05.260
But there are also needs in other lands. Many countries have been blessed to have long-time missionaries who have done excellent work.

00:54:05.260 --> 00:54:17.260
But many of those faithful ones have now passed on. Others have had to leave their assignments because of having to care for aging relatives or because of their own health challenges.

00:54:17.260 --> 00:54:26.260
So here's the question. Is there still a need for missionaries today? The answer is absolutely yes.

00:54:26.260 --> 00:54:40.260
There is a tremendous work to be accomplished in the world in missionary service. And enthusiastic and zealous young people are still being sent out every year to serve as missionaries.

00:54:40.260 --> 00:54:49.260
For example, recently, the Service Committee sent 36 new missionaries to Madagascar and 10 to Latvia.

00:54:50.260 --> 00:54:59.820
Well now, how do these young missionaries feel about their privilege of service? Let's watch.

00:54:59.820 --> 00:55:10.820
Our main preaching need at the moment in Madagascar is training of new ones. We have new publishers who are not even baptized yet, have been progressive Bible studies.

00:55:10.820 --> 00:55:15.820
So we were very happy to receive new young missionaries being assigned.

00:55:15.820 --> 00:55:21.820
We now branch committee learned that we will get some new missionaries to Latvia. We were really thrilled.

00:55:21.820 --> 00:55:29.820
We were three years special pioneers and later we received this letter. I was thinking, Latvia, what do you know about Latvia?

00:55:29.820 --> 00:55:34.820
My legs was trembling, but then I say, it's exciting.

00:55:34.820 --> 00:55:41.820
For me, it's still like a dream and sometimes I'm asking friends, is it really real?

00:55:41.820 --> 00:55:48.820
I was expecting maybe somewhere in Africa and they said, no, no, you will have beautiful snow.

00:55:48.820 --> 00:55:54.820
We really felt these new missionaries invigorating the field. Their enthusiasm is really pushing the work forward.

00:55:54.820 --> 00:55:59.820
Now many publishers are more active in service and by any spirit is increasing.

00:55:59.820 --> 00:56:08.820
I thought you was blessing in our assignment, especially by the children in our congregation. When they hug you, you feel like home and the language doesn't matter anymore.

00:56:08.820 --> 00:56:14.820
I love my mission or the assignment because it has opened my eyes to something beautiful.

00:56:14.820 --> 00:56:18.820
The ministry is simply amazing.

00:56:18.820 --> 00:56:27.820
Being a missionary is something special, but on the other hand, it's quite a normal Christian life focused on the preaching and enjoy everyday life.

00:56:27.820 --> 00:56:33.820
It's okay to be afraid, to have doubts, but give your whole world a chance.

00:56:33.820 --> 00:56:37.820
Being a missionary is the biggest experience in my life.

00:56:37.820 --> 00:56:43.820
My assignment strengthened my spirituality because now I know I'm not afraid of more difficult tasks.

00:56:43.820 --> 00:56:46.820
I agree.

00:56:46.820 --> 00:57:07.210
So we need many more young people to take up missionary service. Well, that raises the question, how do you become a missionary?

00:57:07.210 --> 00:57:16.210
Well, the first step is to enter full-time service. And then, after you've been in full-time service for two years, what do you need to do?

00:57:16.210 --> 00:57:25.210
You need to apply for the school for kingdom evangelizers. SKE is the door to missionary service.

00:57:25.210 --> 00:57:34.210
You also need to have the spirit of Isaiah when he said, here I am, send me willing to go wherever the organization might assign you.

00:57:34.210 --> 00:57:44.210
After you graduate SKE, you could receive an assignment to serve as a temporary special pioneer in your home country so that you can gain experience.

00:57:44.210 --> 00:57:52.210
And if you do well in that assignment, you could receive an assignment to serve as a missionary in another country.

00:57:52.210 --> 00:58:01.210
Missionary service is a thrilling opportunity to bring the good news to honest-hearted people in another part of the world.

00:58:01.210 --> 00:58:08.210
We need young people who want to go and make disciples of people of all the nations.

00:58:08.210 --> 00:58:19.210
Well, how old do you need to be to apply for the school for kingdom evangelizer?

00:58:19.210 --> 00:58:34.210
Well, we're very pleased to announce today that the governing body has decided that young brothers and sisters, 21 years of age or older, may now apply to attend SKE.

00:58:34.210 --> 00:58:55.059
Isn't that exciting and wonderful? But many of you young ones right now are serving where the need is greater.

00:58:55.059 --> 00:59:06.059
Perhaps even in another country, that's wonderful. But we encourage you now to apply for the school for kingdom evangelizers.

00:59:06.059 --> 00:59:14.059
You see, this will allow the organization to see where you could best be used in the worldwide field.

00:59:14.059 --> 00:59:21.059
Young brothers and sisters, please, seize this wonderful opportunity.

00:59:21.059 --> 00:59:30.059
But what about those of us who are a bit older? What can we do to help these young people?

00:59:30.059 --> 00:59:36.059
Let's be generous in training them and in sharing with them our experience.

00:59:36.059 --> 00:59:45.059
Let's help them to grow and encourage them to reach out for these wonderful opportunities to glorify Jehovah.

00:59:45.059 --> 00:59:55.059
When I was just 19 years old, a brother invited me to attend my very first annual meeting. It was a special one.

00:59:55.059 --> 01:00:03.059
The 100th anniversary of the Watchtower Bible and Track Society held in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

01:00:03.059 --> 01:00:17.800
I was so excited, I thought I died and went to heaven.

01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:31.800
I couldn't believe that that brother would invite me to attend when I was so young. But the encouragement from that experience has stayed with me right up until this very moment.

01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:40.800
Brothers and sisters, what will you do? What will you do to encourage a young person to glorify Jehovah?

01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:46.800
Certainly, Jehovah will bless you if you look for ways to do so.

01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:54.800
Well, the preaching work is more urgent than ever before. Will you read with me Romans chapter 10, please?

01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:59.800
Romans chapter 10 and verse 13.

01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:09.800
It says, for everyone who calls on the name of Jehovah will be saved. However, how will they call on him if they have not put faith in him?

01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:18.800
How in turn will they put faith in him about whom they have not heard? How in turn will they hear without someone to preach?

01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:23.800
How in turn will they preach unless they have been sent out?

01:01:23.800 --> 01:01:33.800
Just as it is written, how beautiful are the feet of those who declare good news of good things?

01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:43.800
We need young ones, as verse 15 says, to be sent out to preach the good news. We need young ones to service pioneers and special pioneers and missionaries.

01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:48.800
We need them to apply for the school for kingdom evangelizers.

01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:58.800
So, Jehovah has accomplished an amazing work over these past 140 years. He's blessed the day of small beginnings.

01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:17.130
But, brothers and sisters, the work is not over yet. Do you agree?

01:02:17.130 --> 01:02:24.130
There are exciting opportunities for our beautiful young people. So, young ones, what will you do?

01:02:24.130 --> 01:02:29.130
You can now apply for Bethel and construction service at age 18.

01:02:29.130 --> 01:02:34.130
You can apply for the school for kingdom evangelizers at age 21.

01:02:34.130 --> 01:02:41.130
Put yourself in Jehovah's hands. Make yourself available. You will never regret it.

01:02:41.130 --> 01:02:48.130
And may we as older ones do everything in our power to encourage and train these young people.

01:02:48.130 --> 01:02:53.130
Yes, as Brother Loch said, let's keep polishing those mirrors.

01:02:53.130 --> 01:03:02.130
Let's keep looking for ways to expand our ministry and to glorify our wonderful, our amazing God, Jehovah.

01:03:02.130 --> 01:03:24.409
What a thrilling symposium. We're delighted to have two new members of the governing body and we're delighted by the adjustments to the age requirements for Bethel service and for the school for kingdom evangelizers.

01:03:24.409 --> 01:03:29.409
Did those changes come as a bit of a surprise to you?

01:03:29.409 --> 01:03:34.409
Well, that's sort of related to the next talk on our program.

01:03:34.409 --> 01:03:46.219
Brother Jeffrey Jackson will discuss the theme, don't be surprised by sudden changes. Brother Jeff, you have a attention.

01:03:46.219 --> 01:03:54.219
Well, I'm sure we all agree with this fact. In recent years, there have been a lot of changes.

01:03:54.219 --> 01:04:00.219
Even since the last annual meeting, there have been many changes.

01:04:00.219 --> 01:04:05.219
Some of them, perhaps, are little surprising or may seem to be sudden.

01:04:05.219 --> 01:04:18.219
But you know, brothers and sisters, when we look back on how these changes have come, we can see that Jehovah has gradually prepared us for each of these adjustments and changes.

01:04:18.219 --> 01:04:24.940
Let's review some of the recent changes we've had.

01:04:24.940 --> 01:04:29.940
What changes have we seen with regard to our understanding of Bible teachings?

01:04:29.940 --> 01:04:36.940
At the 2021 annual meeting, we received an adjusted understanding of John 529.

01:04:36.940 --> 01:04:43.940
It was explained that the resurrection of judgment will not be a judgment of condemnation.

01:04:43.940 --> 01:04:47.940
Rather, it will be more like a period of probation.

01:04:47.940 --> 01:04:55.940
The unrighteous mention at Acts 24-15 will have an opportunity to gain everlasting life.

01:04:55.940 --> 01:05:01.940
But their names will not be written in the book of life at the time of their resurrection.

01:05:01.940 --> 01:05:13.940
To have their names eventually written in that book, these ones will need to respond positively to the great educational work that will take place during the thousand-year reign.

01:05:13.940 --> 01:05:25.940
Then, at the annual meeting in 2023, we gained enhanced insight into what we do know and what we don't know concerning Jehovah's judgments.

01:05:25.940 --> 01:05:35.940
We learned that the door of opportunity for people to take a stand for the kingdom does not shut when the Great Tribulation starts with the destruction of false religion.

01:05:35.940 --> 01:05:46.940
At that time, perhaps some will be like the Egyptians in Moses' day who took a last-minute stand and joined the Exodus of God's people.

01:05:46.940 --> 01:05:56.940
At the same annual meeting, we adjusted our views with regard to Jehovah's judgments of those who died in the flood and those who were destroyed in Sodom and Gomorrah.

01:05:57.940 --> 01:06:04.940
Also, at that annual meeting, an adjustment was made regarding the reporting of our time and activity and our preaching work.

01:06:04.940 --> 01:06:12.940
Instead of focusing on reports, we tried to make good use of every opportunity to witness.

01:06:12.940 --> 01:06:17.940
Then we received the 2024 governing body update, number two.

01:06:18.940 --> 01:06:27.940
In that update, we saw the need to adjust how we interact with those who have committed serious sins and have been removed from the congregation.

01:06:27.940 --> 01:06:31.940
What other major adjustments have we recently seen?

01:06:31.940 --> 01:06:40.940
In our preaching work, the emphasis now is on studying Bible studies and making disciples, not on distributing literature.

01:06:41.940 --> 01:06:49.940
To that end, the focus is on studying meaningful conversations, not just on using memorized presentations.

01:06:49.940 --> 01:06:54.940
Were you surprised by these adjustments? Perhaps so.

01:06:54.940 --> 01:07:05.480
But as we look back, we see how one adjustment and understanding gradually helped us with the next adjustment.

01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:17.480
Isn't it true that gradually Jehovah has prepared us, and when we look back on it, we see how logical this training has been to refine our understanding?

01:07:17.480 --> 01:07:22.480
But events in the world likewise have changed.

01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:28.480
It's true sometimes in the world you have sudden changes, for example, the pandemic.

01:07:28.480 --> 01:07:33.480
But oftentimes, change in the world is gradual.

01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:41.480
Isn't it true with regard to the view of morality, homosexuality, abortion?

01:07:41.480 --> 01:07:46.480
Even what's acceptable and not acceptable with regard to conduct?

01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:50.480
All of that has happened gradually in the world.

01:07:50.480 --> 01:08:01.480
And it's not until you look back and see how different the world is today with regard to those matters that we see that there have been a lot of changes.

01:08:01.480 --> 01:08:18.479
But this can be dangerous, because as things gradually change, we may get used to gradual change and forget that there are some sudden changes about to occur.

01:08:18.479 --> 01:08:25.479
Let's take our Bibles, please, and if you turn with me to the book of Luke chapter 21.

01:08:25.479 --> 01:08:30.479
Now, this is an example of sudden change.

01:08:30.479 --> 01:08:40.479
In Luke chapter 21, notice that in verse 34, the words of our Lord Jesus have recorded, and He said in verse 34,

01:08:40.479 --> 01:08:50.479
but pay attention to yourselves that your hearts never become weighed down with overeating and heavy drinking and anxieties of life.

01:08:50.479 --> 01:09:03.479
And suddenly, suddenly, that they be instantly, instantly upon you.

01:09:04.479 --> 01:09:13.479
It's interesting to note that Jesus had already said that this day he was referring to would occur at a time that we don't think is likely.

01:09:13.479 --> 01:09:18.479
So what lesson do we learn from what Jesus said?

01:09:18.479 --> 01:09:24.479
It's a warning, isn't it, that we can't just sit back and think, well, things are gradually going to develop.

01:09:24.479 --> 01:09:29.479
We know which way it's going, and maybe it's not going to happen yet.

01:09:29.479 --> 01:09:37.479
We've got a little bit more wiggle room there with regard to the schedule, but you see that's dangerous thinking.

01:09:37.479 --> 01:09:47.479
Now, what we're going to do is consider two examples of areas where perhaps we could be a little guilty with regard to that.

01:09:47.479 --> 01:09:55.479
For example, our view with regard to the number of anointed ones remaining on the earth.

01:09:55.479 --> 01:10:03.479
Now, for many years, what did we think? We thought, well, that number, we go down and down and down and down.

01:10:03.479 --> 01:10:11.479
Now, I don't know about you, but me, when that report came out, just how many partakers.

01:10:11.479 --> 01:10:24.479
And what were we thinking? Well, probably, maybe we didn't say it, but we think the number will go down, down, down, down, down, and there'll be just a couple of old guys in a wheelchair.

01:10:25.479 --> 01:10:34.479
Who will get their reward? Well, I'm exaggerating, but that was sort of the feeling, wasn't it?

01:10:34.479 --> 01:10:43.479
But now, what have we seen in recent years? Those numbers have gone up and up.

01:10:43.479 --> 01:10:48.479
And not only that younger brothers have been appointed on the governing body.

01:10:48.479 --> 01:10:53.479
Now, I know what you're all thinking to new ones, how old are they?

01:10:53.479 --> 01:11:00.479
We know. You're not Googling now, but you will be.

01:11:00.479 --> 01:11:08.479
But you see, we need to be careful about what we're thinking with regard to the number of anointed ones left on earth.

01:11:08.479 --> 01:11:16.479
You see, 19 years ago, I was appointed on the governing body, even I thought I was too young.

01:11:16.479 --> 01:11:27.760
Now, they tell me I'm not so young anymore. But do we see the point, what does the Bible actually tell us with regard to this?

01:11:27.760 --> 01:11:34.760
Well, it doesn't say the number would just dwindle down to just having a few older ones left. No.

01:11:34.760 --> 01:11:42.760
The great crowd of other sheep will be judged on the basis of how they deal with Christ's brothers.

01:11:42.760 --> 01:11:55.760
So that means the faithful and discreet slave, as well as all the anointed throughout the earth, will continue to be active in doing the work and wanting and needing your support.

01:11:55.760 --> 01:12:02.760
Ride up until the time that suddenly they will be reassigned.

01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:13.760
And isn't that what Matthew 24 verse 31 says? There will be a gathering, the final gathering of the anointed from all different parts of the earth.

01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:23.760
So for us to think, well, there's some new ones on the governing body, they don't look too old. Maybe we've got a little bit extra time.

01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:35.760
Now, Jehovah is making sure that the faithful and discreet slave is continuing to work and is effective right up until that time of reassignment.

01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:47.760
So that's one subject. The second subject we'd like to talk about is our view with regard to the start of the great tribulation, with the destruction of Babel on the Great.

01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:57.760
When we look through the scriptures in Revelation chapter 16, what does it tell us that the waters would gradually dry up?

01:12:57.760 --> 01:13:13.760
Yes, churches are losing support in some countries. For example, Europe. It wasn't that long ago that most nations in Europe were very religious, but now people are turning their backs on religion.

01:13:13.760 --> 01:13:24.760
But at the same time, when we look at Africa and South America, we see that religion still has a strong influence.

01:13:24.760 --> 01:13:34.760
So now, what could be that little voice in our mind saying? Well, yeah, we see it's going in the right direction, but maybe not just yet.

01:13:34.760 --> 01:13:37.760
We've got a little bit more time left.

01:13:38.760 --> 01:13:48.760
But again, we need to remember what the scriptures tell us. And if you turn with me this time, please, to Revelation chapter 17.

01:13:48.760 --> 01:13:57.760
This is one of the chapters that describes the destruction of false religion, or in other words, when the Great Tribulation starts.

01:13:57.760 --> 01:14:04.760
So let's read Revelation 17 and verse 17, and note please what it tells us.

01:14:04.760 --> 01:14:18.760
For God put it into their hearts to carry out His thought. Yes, to carry out their one thought by giving the kingdom to the wild beast until the words of God will have been accomplished.

01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:30.760
Now, what is this one thought? Well, up to now, we've said the one thought is their desire to turn on false religion.

01:14:30.760 --> 01:14:38.760
And we can understand that because the context is talking about the destruction of false religion.

01:14:38.760 --> 01:14:44.760
But you see, if you look back at that verse, what is the one thought?

01:14:44.760 --> 01:14:50.760
Now, this means we have to adjust our understanding, another change.

01:14:50.760 --> 01:15:05.760
What does it say? The one thought refers to the nations being willing to hand over power, their political power, to the scarlet colored wild beasts in the United Nations.

01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:10.760
Let me repeat it, because you're in shock now, and you need to write this down.

01:15:10.760 --> 01:15:22.760
The one thought refers to the nations being willing to hand over power to the United Nations. Now, why is that exciting?

01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:28.760
Well, the fact that nations will eventually turn on religion really isn't that surprising, is it?

01:15:28.760 --> 01:15:34.760
We're gradually, we've seen that happening. We see which way it's going.

01:15:34.760 --> 01:15:45.760
But what about nations empowering the United Nations, handing over their personal political power so the United Nations has more power?

01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:52.760
It has teeth, as it were, at the moments like a teethless, toothless organization, isn't it?

01:15:52.760 --> 01:16:00.760
That seems unbelievable. No nation does that. But what is it that happens?

01:16:00.760 --> 01:16:10.760
It is an act of God. Jehovah puts that one thought into the minds of the nations.

01:16:10.760 --> 01:16:22.760
Yes, they will empower the United Nations so that the United Nations will be in a position to take action against false religion.

01:16:22.760 --> 01:16:30.760
Now, this adjustment in understanding also means that we have to adjust our understanding of verses 12 and 13.

01:16:30.760 --> 01:16:36.760
So if you're in Revelation 17, please let's look at verses 12 and 13.

01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:44.760
The ten horns that you saw mean ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom.

01:16:44.760 --> 01:16:52.760
But they do receive authority as kings for one hour with a wild beast.

01:16:52.760 --> 01:17:00.760
These have one thought so they give their power and authority to the wild beast.

01:17:00.760 --> 01:17:10.760
So up to now, we've assumed these ten kings which represent all the political powers and governments in the world at the moment,

01:17:10.760 --> 01:17:18.760
that they did this during the last days by supporting first of all the League of Nations and then the United Nations.

01:17:18.760 --> 01:17:24.760
But now, what do we understand this to be? See, we understand verse 17.

01:17:24.760 --> 01:17:36.760
Well, there will come a time when all political powers on earth, which includes many who have never been part of the seven world powers,

01:17:36.760 --> 01:17:48.760
they will see that they need to collectively pull their power by giving it to the United Nations to try and solve some of the problems in the world.

01:17:48.760 --> 01:17:54.760
And they will rule, notice what does this say for one hour, just a short period of time.

01:17:54.760 --> 01:18:11.760
So this newly-empowered United Nations from that time on will rule collectively for a short time but it will enable them to destroy false religion and fight against Jesus and Jehovah's people.

01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:29.649
Now, isn't that exciting? But now, we're back to our subject again. You see, gradually things happen.

01:18:29.649 --> 01:18:37.649
So we might say, well, yes, gradually I see battle on the greats losing influence in some places, maybe not yet.

01:18:37.649 --> 01:18:45.649
But don't expect that you'll see governments gradually wanting to give over power. They don't want to do that.

01:18:45.649 --> 01:18:58.649
It takes an act of God. Jehovah will put it into their hearts. This will occur with suddenness. Yes, then the Great Tribulation will start.

01:18:58.649 --> 01:19:08.649
A sudden change, not something that happens gradually. So what have we learned in our discussion? Well, yes, some things change gradually.

01:19:08.649 --> 01:19:15.649
But brothers and sisters, remember, there are some sudden things that are about to occur.

01:19:15.649 --> 01:19:28.649
Let's remember the two things as a reminder. First of all, the remaining anointed ones will suddenly be taken to heaven while they are still very active.

01:19:28.649 --> 01:19:37.649
The second one, Jehovah will suddenly move the nations to give their political power to the United Nations.

01:19:37.649 --> 01:19:45.649
So what's the takeaway? Don't be complacent. Don't think, oh, this is going to gradually change.

01:19:45.649 --> 01:19:54.649
No, some things won't gradually change. They will occur suddenly as acts of God.

01:19:54.649 --> 01:20:14.050
So be ready and don't be surprised by sudden change.

01:20:14.050 --> 01:20:20.050
Thank you, brother Jeff. You've given us much to think about. We'll probably have to watch that talk a few times to get all the points.

01:20:20.050 --> 01:20:30.050
What a faith strengthening program. The second part of the annual meeting will be featured as the broadcast for next month.

01:20:30.050 --> 01:20:39.050
Now it's time for our video postcard. Let's visit our brothers and sisters in Italy.

01:20:39.050 --> 01:20:55.050
This is a land of rich history, vibrant culture and spectacular natural beauty, from Leicomo and the Dolomites in the north to the islands of Sicily and Sardinia in the south.

01:20:55.050 --> 01:21:01.050
Christianity found an early foothold in Italy and spread rapidly.

01:21:01.050 --> 01:21:12.050
Paul's journeys took him to Syracuse, Regium, known as the radio today, Rome and Puthiola, near Naples.

01:21:12.050 --> 01:21:23.050
The preaching work began in modern-day Italy in 1891 when brother C. T. Russell visited the small town of Pina Rolo.

01:21:23.050 --> 01:21:33.050
The first congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses was formed here in 1908. Meetings were first held at the homes of two sisters.

01:21:33.050 --> 01:21:48.050
Just as in the first century, our brothers in the 20th century faced stiff opposition, the fastest government and the clergy suppressed the work of Jehovah's Witnesses for decades.

01:21:48.050 --> 01:21:51.050
But our brothers persevered.

01:21:51.050 --> 01:22:08.050
For example, in 1925, our brothers disguised the first assembly as a wedding in this hotel and brought a remedio cumineti and sister Albina Proti were actually married during the assembly.

01:22:08.050 --> 01:22:21.050
Today, the Italy brand supports more than 250,000 publishers in Italy and the tiny Republic of San Marino, which is boarded by Italy on all sites.

01:22:21.050 --> 01:22:36.050
Our brothers preached in ancient villages like Alberaballo, known for limestone dwellings called Trulli, and they publicly witnessed in iconic cities such as Florence and Venice.

01:22:36.050 --> 01:22:49.050
To assist congregations in Rome and Milan in the ministry, a special initiative in 2023 encourage neighboring congregations to preach in those cities on weekends.

01:22:49.050 --> 01:22:57.050
Almost 13,000 publishers participated, and 63 new Bible studies were started.

01:22:57.050 --> 01:23:05.050
Many refugees have come to Italy from Africa, Asia and Eastern Europe.

01:23:05.050 --> 01:23:21.050
To help our brothers learn to preach in a foreign language, the Italy brands organized 420 courses in 35 languages, including Amharic, Singalese, Tui and Ukrainian.

01:23:21.050 --> 01:23:34.050
Of course, our postcards from Italy would not be complete without talking about food, a delightful and important element of Italian culture and tradition.

01:23:34.050 --> 01:23:48.050
Along with its many wines, Italy is known for its regional cuisines, including pizzas, pastas and cheeses such as Parmesan and hand-made mozzarella.

01:23:48.050 --> 01:23:58.050
The brothers and sisters from the Pina Role sued the congregation, sent us their warm love and greetings.

01:23:58.050 --> 01:24:05.050
From the world headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses, this is JW Broadcasting.
