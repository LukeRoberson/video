00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.080
When I was growing up my parents always used to say

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.960
Pray about your spiritual goals

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.620
work hard and

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:22.660
then

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:24.660
Let Jehovah do the rest

00:00:24.899 --> 00:00:33.140
So that's what I did

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.460
And wow did Jehovah pour out the blessing?

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:42.149
I even got invited to a branch construction project and

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:45.329
I was pretty excited

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:49.520
At first

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.640
Don't get me wrong. It was a privilege to be there

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.399
But the work was harder than I thought it would be

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:07.189
There were a lot of new skills to learn and I have to admit I

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:09.909
Really wanted to impress my overseer

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:14.599
So I pushed hard

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.849
Maybe a little too hard

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:26.480
See all that up there that only stick them down

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:30.599
Okay, do you think you can wrap this up before tomorrow? Sure thing. I'm on it

00:01:31.239 --> 00:01:34.000
You can grab gin and young to give you a hand with the lift

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.239
Jins a pro he'll help you out. Got it

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:44.010
The job didn't look that hard and I mean I had the training

00:01:44.849 --> 00:01:46.370
so

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:50.609
If I had waited for them there was no way we were going to get this done today

00:01:51.129 --> 00:02:31.300
The fact is I had caused some real damage

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.099
And I made more work for everyone

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.620
Ian are you okay?

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:41.699
Yes, I'm fine

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:52.740
Do you have a minute to talk in my office? I felt like such a loser

00:02:53.419 --> 00:03:06.439
The brothers talked to me and they were nice about it, but I was still left thinking

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.240
What am I doing here?

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:11.319
Maybe I should just go home

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.400
James 3 2 says

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.000
4 real stumble many times

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:25.360
But the real question is when we stumble and it is going to happen. What should we do then?

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:29.770
Yes, Jake

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:37.849
When dad was teaching me to ride my bike, I fell a lot and it was hard

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.250
But I just kept getting up and trying again

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:44.889
And now I can ride pretty fast

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:48.330
So you just have to get back up when you fall

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:52.090
Yes, that's right, that was a great comment

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:55.449
Wow, Jake, that's it

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:59.770
I had to swallow my pride and just get back up

00:04:06.469 --> 00:04:10.949
I realized I needed to be more focused on the seriousness of my assignment

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:13.509
And not so focused on myself

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.709
And instead of trying to do everything myself

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:21.509
I set more realistic expectations

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:24.870
About what I could do and what I couldn't

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.600
I had a lot to learn

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.040
So I kept working and learning

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:42.420
And after a while, I even got to help train some of the new volunteers

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.959
In the end, I was so thankful to Jehovah

00:04:47.959 --> 00:04:55.399
for helping me understand that in the race for life, none of us are going to cross the finish line without stumbling

00:04:56.839 --> 00:05:01.240
The important thing is to get back up and just keep going

00:05:01.399 --> 00:05:11.399
So you just have to get back up and just keep going

00:05:11.399 --> 00:05:21.399
So you just have to get back up and just keep going
