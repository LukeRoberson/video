00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:10.460
And in production to the book of Jonah, Jehovah assigned the prophet Jonah to deliver a

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:16.820
warning to the Assyrian city of Nineveh.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:23.260
Jonah prophesied sometime during the reign of Israel's King Jerobo in the Second.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:29.500
Jonah wrote the book, bearing his name, about 844 BCE.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:36.740
This was about 100 years before Assyria took Israel into exile, and some 200 years before

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:43.009
Nehom foretold the destruction of the Assyrian city of Nineveh.

00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:48.530
Jonah lived about the time of Amos, who also prophesied in the Northern Kingdom of Israel,

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.219
and Joel, who prophesied in Judah.

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.140
The book of Jonah has four chapters.

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:02.659
In chapters 1 and 2, we learn of Jonah receiving an assignment from Jehovah to go to Nineveh.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:08.980
Overwhelmed, Jonah evades the assignment by boarding a ship headed for Tarshish.

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:13.859
Jehovah causes a terrible storm to come up at sea.

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:21.180
Jonah knows that he is responsible for the storm and tells the sailors to throw him overboard.

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.780
When they do, the storm abates.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.379
Jehovah sends a huge fish to swallow Jonah.

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:37.500
From inside the fish's belly, Jonah prays to Jehovah, and his prayer is heard.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:44.939
Jehovah then commands the fish and it vomits Jonah out onto dry land.

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.700
Did you know?

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.819
Jesus foretold that he would die and be resurrected on the third day.

00:01:51.819 --> 00:02:01.170
He called this the sign of Jonah the prophet, alluding to Jonah's deliverance from the huge fish.

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.409
Chapter 3 describes how Jonah carries out his assignment.

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:10.930
He preaches the message that Nineveh will soon be overthrown.

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:19.569
To Jonah's surprise, however, the Nineveh's repent, and Jehovah mercifully spares them.

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:24.889
Chapter 4 reveals that instead of rejoicing over the repentance of the Nineveh's,

00:02:24.889 --> 00:02:28.610
Jonah becomes angry.

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:34.669
He sets up a shelter outside the city to see what will happen.

00:02:34.669 --> 00:02:46.050
Jehovah uses a bottle-gourd plant and a worm to teach Jonah a valuable lesson in loyal love and mercy.

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:52.849
As you read the book of Jonah, note how Jonah accepted correction and fulfilled his assignment.

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:58.289
How Jehovah displayed loyal love and mercy toward the repentant Nineveh's.

00:02:58.289 --> 00:03:03.729
And how Jesus used Jonah's experience to fertile his own death and resurrection,

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:07.889
which opens the way to everlasting life under God's kingdom.
