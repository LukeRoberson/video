The trunk of the African elephant is an impressive multi-tool.

00:00:32.429 --> 00:00:35.549
It is both flexible and strong.

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.990
It can pick up a blade of grass or uprooted tree.

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:54.880
Some elephants can use their trunks to feed themselves around 270 kilograms of vegetation

00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:16.480
every day. With their trunks they can suck water like a straw, spray like a fountain

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:30.450
and swim with a snorkel. The trunk can give a gentle touch, give a strong push

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:35.200
or sound a warning trumpet.

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:43.840
Engineers at Maya the elephant trunks remarkable flexibility. This comes from having no bone.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:53.599
Instead, it contains about 150,000 muscle units, an incredible marriage of strength and structure.

00:01:54.799 --> 00:02:01.280
Inspired by the elephant's trunk, researchers are designing robots for the future with greater flexibility.

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:09.120
Industrial design often can be made better by copying the perfectly beautiful solutions

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:12.800
in the natural world. What do you think?

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:20.750
Did the elephant's trunk evolve? Or...
