00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:07.879
I started studying the Bible with Jehovah's Witnesses when I was 14.

00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:13.880
The moment I realized that God did exist, I was so happy and prayed saying,

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.879
I just assume you didn't exist, please forgive me.

00:00:18.879 --> 00:00:23.879
Right away, I told my family that I wouldn't be able to join the Christmas

00:00:23.879 --> 00:00:27.879
and birthday parties we cherished.

00:00:27.879 --> 00:00:32.880
My mother called all our relatives and spoke to them in tears

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.880
as she told them that her daughter had joined a terrible religion.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:42.880
She even told my study conductor to give back her daughter.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.880
She felt like I was taken from her.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:54.880
When I observed those things, at times, I felt as if I was doing something wrong.

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.819
But then, I knew that if I compromised, Jehovah would be sad.

00:01:05.819 --> 00:01:08.819
Jehovah had kindly let me know the truth.

00:01:08.819 --> 00:01:16.859
I strongly felt that in order to please him, I should not give up.

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:19.859
It would have been easy if I had given up then.

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:25.859
Yet I knew that if I did, I wouldn't be able to draw my parents to the truth.

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:29.859
I knew I could get emotional if I tried to talk with them face to face,

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:32.859
so I wrote them letters instead.

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:40.859
I prayed and prayed and kept telling my mother how much I appreciated her.

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:46.859
Gradually, she realized that she hadn't lost her daughter and she was relieved.

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:54.859
Now, someone is calling on her and we have a very peaceful and pleasant relationship.
