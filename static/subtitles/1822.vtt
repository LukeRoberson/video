00:00:01.649 --> 00:00:20.120
On July 24, 1958, I got baptized, and on November 5, 1958, I already got arrested for refusal to do military service.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:26.120
The second time I was convicted was again for refusal to do military service.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:31.120
The next court trial took place in 1963.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:35.119
I got seven years and five years exiled.

00:00:35.119 --> 00:00:41.119
They added three years that I did not serve for refusal to go to the army.

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:46.259
I was taken to Mordovia.

00:00:46.259 --> 00:00:53.259
This was the first camp where all believers were put amongst them 360 of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:00:53.259 --> 00:01:01.259
The detentions were very strict, because around this time the governments and party politics changed.

00:01:01.259 --> 00:01:08.269
They decided that prisoners must suffer hunger.

00:01:08.269 --> 00:01:11.269
The food Russians were cut.

00:01:11.269 --> 00:01:16.269
This was very difficult, very difficult I must say.

00:01:16.269 --> 00:01:18.269
And the winters can be cold.

00:01:18.269 --> 00:01:28.250
Even in March, he could get his cold as 35 degrees Celsius, minus 35.

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:35.250
Spiritual things were for all of us, the brothers in this camp, top priority.

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:44.250
First of all, all 360 people were divided into four congregations, and every congregation was divided into groups.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:50.250
Every congregation had responsible brothers as overseers, and so had every group.

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:58.250
We conducted the study not just once a week, we conducted the study every day, every day.

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:05.620
And brothers took this very seriously. We had no time for any worldly thoughts.

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:11.620
Every Saturday and Sunday we had a very powerful choir, men's voices.

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:19.620
When we were singing, we stationed guards near the oversight house where supervisors were on duty.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:30.620
And if one of them came out, it was signalled from one brother to the next, so that if he or they came closer, we would already be gone.

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:37.620
But the most interesting thing was, we were singing in the zone, we were the prisoners.

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:43.620
But our listeners were outside, they were sitting up in the trees.

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:52.620
The children of the supervisors, officers and guards, and they were listening to our choir.

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.620
All together during that time, I was in seven prison camps.

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:07.060
I spent about 13 years there, and another five years in exile in Siberia.

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:14.060
But when I was convicted the last time, the head of the interrogation department came into my cell and said,

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:21.060
Victor, when you finish all your prison terms, you will have nothing at all, no family, no children.

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:26.060
I smiled at him and asked, how do you know this citizen lieutenant colonel?

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:31.060
I don't know it either, but I do trust in Jehovah.

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:38.370
Today I do have a family, and do have my wife, my children.

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:55.139
We continue to serve Jehovah, and my greatest joy is when my six-year-old granddaughter stands next to me in the Kingdom Hall and sings songs that praise Jehovah.

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:59.139
Well, to make it simple, I would put it this way.

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:03.139
Preserve your love for Jehovah and for your brothers.

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:08.139
Joy in Jehovah's service. Never lose it.

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:15.139
We will not fear anything bad, neither cold nor hunger, nothing.
