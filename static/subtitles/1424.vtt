00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:05.860
Have you ever considered helping out in the foreign language field?

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:09.699
Perhaps there is a need in your local circuit.

00:00:09.699 --> 00:00:15.699
All over the earth, the organization provides language courses

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:21.100
with a goal of reaching every nation, tribe, tongue, and people

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.699
with a good news of God's Word.

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:30.699
Brother Juan Carlos JacÃ³n serves as a special pioneer

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:36.700
in the rapidly growing Shwar language field in Ecuador.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:41.700
He was recently asked to attend a course at the local branch

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.700
to become a language teacher so that he could help

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:53.960
willing publishers learn the language.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:09.959
No, it has been said before, this is a language of the devil

00:01:09.959 --> 00:01:13.959
that it should be forgotten.

00:01:13.959 --> 00:01:19.040
It serves no purpose.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:29.140
But to Jehovah, no nation is insignificant.

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:40.099
I grew up in an area of the Ecuadorian jungle where there is a large community of Shwar people.

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:50.040
Like many native languages, Shwar is very complex.

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.040
We need many, many workers in the field, but if we don't give them a foundation,

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:00.040
if we don't help them or give them a little push, it's difficult for them to enter this field.

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:13.889
I received an invitation to attend a seminar for language instructors.

00:02:13.889 --> 00:02:22.889
There were 58 students in the class representing 16 different languages or language groups.

00:02:22.889 --> 00:02:30.889
You are in the cutting edge of language instruction.

00:02:30.889 --> 00:02:35.889
We are learning fantastic teaching techniques, real techniques that work.

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:45.199
The instructor told us how humor helps our minds to create a world of connections

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:49.199
which stimulates our brain.

00:02:49.199 --> 00:03:05.080
I never learned to draw well.

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:12.080
We draw a scene and starting with our native language, along with large gestures.

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:19.080
We act out a dialogue, little by little, we convert the scene into the new language.

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:44.780
What scares me that I've never done this before?

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:49.900
This will be my first time.

00:03:49.900 --> 00:04:05.289
I don't have any experience teaching languages.

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:16.319
Although I felt intimidated by this, I knew that with Jehovah, all things are possible.

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:35.060
Welcome to the first day of the Shwar Language Course.

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:44.060
The techniques they offered us in the course were like a box of tools that we need to study more carefully

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:50.069
and see how to apply them in each circumstance.

00:04:50.069 --> 00:04:59.069
When we are in the territory, we see how people's eyes light up when they learn the name of God.

00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:04.069
Alverque, I just see that there is so much need for them to learn the truth.

00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:09.069
That has motivated us to come here and continue serving here.

00:05:09.069 --> 00:05:21.360
Since God has created us, we know that He will never abandon us.

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:25.360
He thinks about us all the time and He loves us very much.

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.360
I didn't know that before.

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:35.360
I feel so happy now because I can really understand the word of God.

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:44.360
Being in an isolated group far from other congregations, my wife and I have felt every day how real Jehovah is.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:51.360
Jehovah is now looking and giving his attention to these small places no matter how small they are.

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:59.360
If people have a good heart and want to serve Jehovah, He will send workers to give the help that is needed.

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:06.360
And in reality, this moves us to say to Him with all of our heart.

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.360
Thank you, Jehovah.
