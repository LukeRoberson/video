00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:06.929
Our brothers and sisters in Brazil experienced an opportunity to make special efforts in

00:00:06.929 --> 00:00:12.769
their preaching work when the Olympic and Paralympic Games were held there in August and

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:15.890
September of 2016.

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:22.809
Close to 15,000 athletes from approximately 205 countries were present along with many

00:00:22.809 --> 00:00:33.850
visitors.

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.570
More than 1 million tourists were present at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, and

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.929
among them were around 410,000 foreigners.

00:00:43.929 --> 00:00:48.530
In an effort to teach these ones about the Bible, Jehovah's Witnesses engaged in a special

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.170
public witnessing campaign.

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:58.729
To reach as many people as possible, we set up 268 cards, not only were the games were

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:02.250
held, but also throughout the city of Rio de Janeiro.

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.129
That way, we were able to reach people from even far away islands like Vanuatu, which

00:01:07.129 --> 00:01:09.489
is one of the islands of the Pacific.

00:01:09.489 --> 00:01:23.260
Delegates from that island picked up publications from our witnessing cards.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.739
We made efforts to put the stands and cards as close as possible to the places where the

00:01:27.739 --> 00:01:29.340
brothers would work.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.859
Thanks to Jehovah, we were able to get a strategic location near the entrance to the arenas,

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:41.019
which we didn't think would be possible.

00:01:41.019 --> 00:01:46.340
We planned to have 1,500 volunteers, but we got 4,000 volunteers.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.780
We asked for help from other cities, other states, and also from foreign language congregations.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:58.939
So for us, this was beyond our expectations.

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:03.180
During the Olympics, more than 1 million people passed through the harbor here, and thanks

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.259
to Jehovah, we were able to set up more than 40 cards in the immediate harbor area and

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.620
placed almost 20,000 pieces of literature.

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.020
To refill the cards, we used a quadrucicle that picked up the publications at the support

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:22.469
hub and took them to the brothers' ethical cards.

00:02:22.469 --> 00:02:27.789
The media provided extensive coverage with more than 26,000 press professionals involved,

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:33.110
and security was also reinforced with more than 22,000 military personnel.

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:40.030
The work of our brothers certainly did not go unnoticed.

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:45.509
We were at the cart when suddenly a police car full of officers stopped in front of us.

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:49.110
I was worried they were going to ask us questions or make us leave.

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.710
But then they got out of the car, came towards us, and one of them picked up the Bible Teach

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:58.069
book, and without saying anything to us told the others,

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:01.069
didn't I tell you I was going to find them here?

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:04.030
You can take these publications, they're free.

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:10.729
These books would teach you amazing things.

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:19.090
This campaign helped overcome prejudices, both with the authorities and people in general,

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.810
because they were able to see the international scope of our work.

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.689
And this became especially clear when it came to the officials because they allowed the

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:33.740
brothers to put the cards as close as possible to the arenas where the games were being held.

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:39.379
In all, more than 85,000 publications and more than 10 languages were distributed by

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:44.099
means of the 268 cards scattered throughout the city.

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:50.219
Over a year of planning went into preparing for this event and produced excellent results.

00:03:50.219 --> 00:03:55.020
Our international preaching work was made known to thousands present at the Olympic Games,

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:59.219
and most importantly, it gave a great shout of praise to our God, Jehovah.
