00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:06.690
These are very practical comments, and they all tie in well with what the Apostle Paul was trying to tell

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.089
those in the Ephesian congregation about

00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:13.849
Examining themselves the same way we have to do today

00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:21.269
Examining ourselves so that we please Jehovah if you'd like please open up to Ephesians chapter 5 and we'll read verse 10

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:24.870
Which is our theme scripture?

00:00:25.129 --> 00:00:27.129
Ephesians chapter 5 and verse 10

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:31.710
It says keep on making sure of what is acceptable to the Lord and

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.950
And then it goes on in verse 11 and

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.270
Stop sharing in the unfruitful works that belong to the darkness rather

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:42.829
Expose them for what they are

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.390
So it's very clear to us in this chapter of Ephesians chapter 5

00:00:48.869 --> 00:00:53.549
That there are things that Jehovah views as acceptable and he views as

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:55.509
unacceptable

00:00:55.509 --> 00:00:58.310
Jehovah's standard of what is unacceptable is

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.670
Is outlined in quite a few of the verses in chapter 5 here if you would just scan through

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:11.150
Verse 3 4 and 5 we'll see that unwholesome talk about sex shameful conduct

00:01:11.829 --> 00:01:14.590
Obsying and gesting and then verse 18

00:01:15.069 --> 00:01:20.269
Drunkenness. Well, these are things that will bar us from God's kingdom

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.829
When you think about entertainment today

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:26.510
It's merely impossible to try to find something that is acceptable

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.349
To Jehovah that does not have immoral sex

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:31.390
pornography

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.390
spiritism and violence

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.269
Satan has thoroughly saturated all forms of the media

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:42.189
So thoroughly that it's in our literature and movies. It's in electronic games or

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:45.670
Everything that we can think of Satan has infiltrated

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.030
Yes, he knows that Jehovah hates these things and

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:55.790
He doesn't mind if part of our heart hates these things as long as part of our heart

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:59.750
Loves these things. So we do well to ask ourselves

00:02:00.269 --> 00:02:06.430
Does the entertainment that I choose does it help me in my being acceptable to Jehovah?

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:08.830
Does it help me to

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.750
Have the qualities that the Jehovah endures in us and will draw closer to us?

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:22.150
Well the spirit of the world reflects rebellion of the Bible which outlines Jehovah's qualities and his standards

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:30.349
We want to show respect for the Bible which teaches us to love what Jehovah loves and hate what he hates

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:36.870
And what will help us to do this and resist the spirit of the world and draw closer to Jehovah and be

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.750
Acceptable to him. Let's notice verse 17 chapter 5 and verse 17

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:51.090
It says on this account stop being unreasonable, but he perceiving what the will of Jehovah is

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:55.969
We need to constantly think what would Jehovah want me to do?

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.330
Well, verse 1 and verse 2 helps us to appreciate this

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:06.930
It says become imitators of God as beloved children and go on walking in love just as the Christ also loved us

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:12.090
He gave himself up for us as an offering and a sacrifice a sweet

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:20.930
Fragments to God. So bottom line we need to imitate Jehovah and Jesus our sacrifices need to be acceptable

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:26.770
To Jehovah as was Jesus. What made Jesus so pleasing?

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:29.169
Well, he did everything

00:03:29.169 --> 00:03:31.530
Way Jehovah wanted him to do in fact

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.129
He said something that we want to say one day

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:39.849
I always do the things pleasing to him and one day in perfection. We will be able to say that

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:44.090
Jesus was pleasing in his word and his deed and his actions

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:48.409
Well, how can we imitate Jesus and thus imitate Jehovah?

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:50.889
Well, let's briefly discuss three ways

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:52.650
first

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.650
Pray for God's Holy Spirit

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:59.210
When confronted with trials what did Jesus do? He did not rely on himself

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:06.330
He petitioned Jehovah for help. So if we're struggling with a temptation a certain fleshly weakness

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:13.530
It's vital that we do the same and we can also talk to the elders our loving shepherds who will pray with us and

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.529
They will definitely help us to remain faithful with words of encouragement

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.649
Number two, obey Jehovah

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:28.610
Completely Jesus always did things that were pleasing to his father Luke 22 42 said

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:36.009
Let not my will but yours take place remember. There's no substitute for obedience

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:38.970
We cannot be acceptable without obedience

00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:42.370
Number three, no the scriptures well

00:04:43.089 --> 00:04:52.170
Jesus used God's word as his authority his whole life revolved around knowing and obeying and encouraging others about God's laws

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:56.730
We all have busy schedules. We have work to do busy in a congregation

00:04:57.649 --> 00:05:03.370
It's more than just trying to find time to dig deep in the God's word. We must make the time

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:11.290
So what do our schedules tell us about our love for Jehovah our love for his word

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:13.810
Do we read the Bible daily?

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:21.569
And if we do how much time do we take to let it sink into our mind and our heart and to meditate?

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:29.490
Are we content with just looking at the basics the surface or digging deep and deep below the surface?

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:33.850
It's vital that we train our minds and our hearts

00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:36.730
But it takes time and it takes effort

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:41.089
Just as a marathon runner must devote much time and effort to his

00:05:41.769 --> 00:05:47.529
Training to run a race in fact as we know Christians are likened to running a race and it's a race for life

00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:51.490
Let's see what the Apostle Paul had to tell us if we go over to first Corinthians

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:56.120
First Corinthians chapter nine

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:00.759
Scripture we know very well and we'll start in verse 24

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:06.399
There's a few key elements that we would like to extract as we're reading these verses here Paul said

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:11.839
Do you know that the runners in a race all run but only one receives the prize?

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.560
Running such a way that you may win it

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:21.199
Now everyone competing in a contest exercises self-control in all things

00:06:21.199 --> 00:06:25.319
There's a key of course they do not receive a crown that can perish

00:06:25.439 --> 00:06:27.439
But one that does not perish

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:35.360
Therefore the way I am running is not aimlessly the way I am aiming my blows is so as not to strike

00:06:35.839 --> 00:06:40.040
Striking the air, but I pommel my body and the footnote says

00:06:40.519 --> 00:06:46.360
Punish strictly discipline and lead it as a slave so that after I have preached to others

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:53.399
I myself should not become disapproved or the footnote says disqualified somehow

00:06:54.839 --> 00:06:58.480
So we definitely want to have self-control like a runner

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:05.319
We need to say no to Satan's world and yes to things that are acceptable to Jehovah and we definitely want to

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:09.600
Make sure that we are acceptable and never to be disapproved

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:12.800
Perhaps we can illustrate this in a

00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:20.680
1994 New York City marathon. There was a young man named Hermann Silva and he ran an outstanding race

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:28.519
In fact, there was only a half mile to the finish line in Central Park and somehow he got distracted. He took the wrong path

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:32.560
Did he lose the race? Well the lead runner took over?

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:38.879
Well, he he got redirected. He went back on the path. He began to run faster and faster

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.480
He passed up the lead runner and he won the New York City Marathon in two seconds

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.360
What does this tell us it tells us that sometimes we can lose our focus

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:54.519
We can be sidetracked or we could get involved in unacceptable conduct

00:07:54.759 --> 00:08:00.519
But allow God's word and loving shepherds to readjust our course never give up

00:08:01.279 --> 00:08:03.279
Just a few years later after that

00:08:03.279 --> 00:08:09.160
1997 Hermann began running again in a New York City Marathon. He thought he had this one all

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:12.120
In in the bag. He thought he was gonna win this race

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:20.000
But he started to run slower. He began to dehydrate it instead of taking just a few seconds to hydrate

00:08:20.439 --> 00:08:24.439
He skipped that. He thought he could do it. Well, what could this tell us?

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:32.279
Well, we cannot afford to take shortcuts. We need to have a regular intake of spiritual food to keep pace with Jehovah's

00:08:32.279 --> 00:08:35.799
Organization. We do this by what the commenters told us today

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:42.440
That is a regular intake of God's word and meditation as we run the Christian course the race for life

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.879
Remember, it's not the speed. It's the direction. That's what matters the most

00:08:47.879 --> 00:08:52.240
I mean, we always run it in such a way that is acceptable to Jehovah
