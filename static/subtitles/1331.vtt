00:00:08.529 --> 00:00:12.529
I think when most think of Puerto Rico, they think of sun,

00:00:12.529 --> 00:00:16.530
beach, mofongo, good food.

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:19.530
Just beautiful, loving, and joyful people.

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:23.530
But they don't realize there's a lot of spiritual activity

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:26.530
that's been taking place on this island for a decade.

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:28.530
And our goal is to make sure everybody on the island

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.530
knows about this beautiful work taking place.

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:35.530
Jesus said that we would be one flock, one shepherd.

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.530
And sometimes if you live on an island in the middle of the ocean,

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.530
you may feel a little bit isolated.

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.530
But when the whole world comes to town,

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.530
and you get to experience it on your own soil,

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.530
it is just a tremendous experience.

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.530
And that's what we've seen here in Puerto Rico.

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.530
The brothers have just been so excited about the program.

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.530
You can see Jehovah really is blessed

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.530
the brothers and sisters in Puerto Rico.

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.530
Having delegates coming from the different countries,

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.530
from Cuba, Brazil, Guyana, the United States,

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.530
and it's drawn them together in love.

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.530
It's just been like a big hug for the whole branch territory.

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.530
We have many of them.

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:14.530
Welcome, brothers.

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.530
We hope you will enjoy the spiritual food.

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.530
We love you very much.

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.530
Well, we heard about the convention here.

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.530
And so we applied immediately

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.530
because we had been here 50 years before

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.530
to the first international convention here.

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.530
Brother Nore encouraged us to go into Spanish.

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.530
So we did 50 years ago.

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.530
We wanted to come back.

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.530
Well, I think of the work of the brothers and sisters

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.530
that put into preparing for this convention.

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.530
We think of the negotiations that were taking place

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.530
for over a year ago.

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.530
And then the preparation for the delegates,

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.530
all the work with the audio and video.

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.530
It really shows what these brothers have done

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.530
and all the crews and their families

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.530
in making this happen.

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.530
And that just, that's a lot of love.

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:00.530
Excellent.

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.530
The brothers have gone above and beyond.

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.530
Nothing has stood underway.

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.530
Well, as soon as I came through the door

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.530
from the baggage claim area,

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.530
there was a huge group of brothers and sisters

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.530
and everyone applauding.

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.530
And it just made us feel like one big family.

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.530
Besides the overwhelming heat,

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.530
it was the overwhelming love.

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.530
I feel like it's been a lesson in hospitality.

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.530
You know, because the friends have been just so welcoming.

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.530
And I feel like it's just made an imprint on my heart.

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.530
Well, I think the Puerto Rican and really the Caribbean spirit

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.530
is a lot of enthusiasm, a lot of hugging,

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.530
a lot of kissing, a lot of love.

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.530
When there's two Puerto Ricans together,

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.569
they sound like ten.

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:45.569
I already crazed so much.

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:47.569
You have made me cry again.

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:49.569
Thank you.

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:50.569
Thank you.

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:56.280
Thank you.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.280
When I'm on stage signing,

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.280
I see brothers crying.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.280
And I realize that I'm doing this

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.280
for Jehovah and the brothers.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.280
The highlight for me is always going out in the ministry

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.280
and the countries that we visit.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.280
That's a memory that I'll take home with me.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.280
Because when we unite together in doing our preaching work,

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.280
that's like the best form of unity that we can have.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.280
We knock at the door and there came a lady

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.280
and we invited her to the convention.

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.280
And she said,

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.280
Oh, I think I can make it on Friday.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.280
I came because of an invitation that I received,

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.280
which is this one.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.280
Actually, she called me this morning at 6.30 a.m.

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.280
I was not going to answer the phone because I did.

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.280
It was she that she was telling me that she was coming.

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.280
I like the theme of the resurrection very much

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.280
because, well, it's been two years.

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:09.280
I lost my father and I haven't been able to get over that.

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.280
It helped me think more about God

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:18.040
and it gives me comfort to know that my dad is okay.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.040
This convention is so beautiful.

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:25.220
It moves you to the core.

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:28.220
You know, at this convention, we learned about loyalty

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.220
and we learned that loyalty is really an aspect of love.

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.220
And so we had an opportunity to show our love

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.220
for our brothers, our love for Jehovah

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.220
and it helped us to understand loyalty in just a whole different way.

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.220
And I think when the brothers go home,

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:50.220
that picture of their desire to be loyal to Jehovah,

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.220
to be loyal to our brotherhood,

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.220
is going to be fixed in their mind.

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:57.220
It's going to be something unforgettable.
