00:00:04.139 --> 00:00:09.810
Every day, we see patterns in the world around us.

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:13.810
They testify to the careful design and hard work that produced them.

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:22.109
But what about the patterns that are not made by man, but appear in the natural world?

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.109
What do they reveal?

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:28.969
Consider the snowflake.

00:00:28.969 --> 00:00:34.969
These tiny crystals are formed when water vapor in a cloud condenses directly into ice.

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:41.340
As the crystals grow, delicate and beautiful patterns emerge.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:53.100
Look more closely at the pattern within a single snowflake.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:01:00.100
The crystal and arms branch, then branch again and again at increasingly smaller sizes.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:12.819
Mathematicians studying this concept of self-similarity use the term fractal to describe a shape that has a consistent, repeated pattern at multiple scales.

00:01:12.819 --> 00:01:17.819
Where else can fractal patterns be seen in the natural world?

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:21.819
Trees can demonstrate a degree of self-similarity.

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:27.819
The trunk splits into limbs, which split into branches, then twigs, and so on.

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:33.069
We see a similar type of fractal pattern in the leaves of a fern.

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:41.069
A different type of pattern, but one that is also a fractal, can be seen in the shell of the chambered nautilus.

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:50.069
As it grows, the nautilus builds new larger chambers and seals off the older, smaller ones that it no longer needs.

00:01:50.069 --> 00:02:00.069
The result is a spiral that is fractal in nature, maintaining a similar shape as it increases in size.

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:10.069
Natural spiral patterns of this type can be observed in many places, from the cloud formations of a hurricane to tiny shells on the beach.

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:22.069
From the arrangement of the stars in a galaxy to the seeds on a sunflower head, what causes these spiral patterns?

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:29.069
In the case of the sunflower, it has to do with the specific angle at which new plant growths form.

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:37.069
This angle, approximately 137.5 degrees, is sometimes called the golden angle.

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:46.069
It results in an ideally compact arrangement with no wasted space and creates distinct spiral patterns.

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:59.740
If the sunflower grew not at the golden angle, but at a different angle, for example 140 degrees, we would see radial arms instead, and the seed arrangement would not be as efficient.

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:10.740
As we look even closer, we can discern a fascinating mathematical relationship between this golden angle and a series of numbers called the Fibonacci sequence.

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:17.740
In this progression, each number is determined by adding the previous two numbers together.

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:24.740
Interestingly, these Fibonacci numbers can often be observed in plants.

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:31.740
This sunflower has 34 spirals in one direction and 55 going the other way.

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:35.740
Both of these numbers are in the Fibonacci sequence.

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:47.210
A pineapple will often have 8 or 13 spirals. Flowers with a spiral growth pattern tend to have a Fibonacci number of petals.

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:51.210
Why are these numbers significant?

00:03:52.210 --> 00:04:04.900
As the Fibonacci sequence progresses, the relationship between successive numbers comes closer and closer to defining the exact value of the golden angle.

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:17.899
This intriguing mathematical relationship between the golden angle of plant growth and the number of resulting spirals reminds us that the patterns we see in the natural world are not merely accidental.

00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:31.170
Each one is a reflection of order and careful design, as we take time to examine these patterns more closely.

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:49.310
We are filled with a sense of wonder at the workmanship of their designer, Jehovah God, for his invisible qualities are clearly seen from the world's creation onward, because they are perceived by the things made.
