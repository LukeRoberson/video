WEBVTT

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:11.220
But now continuing down this path that Brother Morah started us on, Brother Sanderson is going to develop the theme.

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:14.220
Are you ready?

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:19.219
And we'll find out what we're supposed to be ready for in this talk, Brother Sanderson.

00:00:19.219 --> 00:00:27.219
And to begin his part, please look at the monitors. There's a short video clip at the beginning of his part.

00:00:27.219 --> 00:00:55.460
Are you ready? What you just saw occurred in the Kastroma region on Russia.

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:08.459
The home of a very young couple was raided. And why? Simply because they wanted to worship the only true and living God, Jehovah.

00:01:09.459 --> 00:01:18.459
Now, why is this of interest to all of us who are here today? And why is it that we all need to be ready?

00:01:19.459 --> 00:01:28.459
Well, Daniel, chapter 11, foretold a rivalry between two kings, the King of the North and the King of the South.

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:36.459
This rivalry has stretched out over thousands of years, and it continues down to our day.

00:01:37.459 --> 00:02:01.459
The King of the North has manifested a hatred for God's people. For example, in the 20th century, and particularly during the time of the Second World War, when Nazi Germany was acting then as the King of the North, we remember there was a high concentration of anointed Christians in the area that was being ruled over by Nazi Germany.

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:17.460
Well, how did the King of the North treat them? We remember. They were cruelly persecuted, sent to concentration camps. And as a result of this, as foretold in Daniel chapter 11 and verse 31,

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:29.460
persecution from that German King of the North resulted in the removal of what Daniel 1131 calls the constant feature.

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:40.460
That is, the public preaching activity of God's people was suspended for a period of time. Well, what happened when the Second World War ended?

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:49.460
A new King of the North emerged. And who was that? Well, of course, it was the Soviet Union and its allies.

00:02:49.460 --> 00:03:01.460
And they too, cruelly persecuted God's people. They banned our worship of Jehovah. They imprisoned many in work camps and exiled our brothers to Siberia.

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:10.460
But what happened? In time, as Daniel chapter 11 and verse 34 says,

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:21.460
a little help was given. Now, what was that little help that was given? Well, as the Soviet Union collapsed,

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:33.460
bands were lifted across the former territories of the Soviet Union, as well as in other lands that formerly had been a part of the eastern block behind the Iron Curtain.

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:49.460
Well, what happened then? As we well know, the preaching work opened up in that whole region of the earth and hundreds of thousands of honest-hearted ones flocked to Jehovah's organization.

00:03:50.460 --> 00:04:07.460
Well, now, brothers, where do we find ourselves now? Well, as Brother Morris so beautifully explained, after prayerful consideration, the governing body believes that Russia and its allies today represent the King of the North.

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:28.459
And that pushing that we are seen between the King of the North and the King of the South through these trade wars and cyber espionage and even through Russia's seizure of neighboring territories such as Crimea demonstrate that we are living at a time when this prophecy is undergoing fulfillment.

00:04:28.459 --> 00:04:36.459
Well, is there anything more that the governing body can say at this time about Daniel chapter 11?

00:04:37.459 --> 00:04:51.939
Let's consider together the words of Daniel chapter 11 and verse 41. It says, he will also enter into the land of the decoration.

00:04:51.939 --> 00:05:04.470
Now, let's stop there. We have long held that the land of the decoration is the spiritual estate of Jehovah's people.

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:13.470
Well, what have we seen over the last approximately 18 months in the country of Russia? Please watch.

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:27.470
On April 20, 2017, Russia's Supreme Court ruled to terminate the activity of all legal entities of Jehovah's witnesses in Russia and to confiscate their property.

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:39.470
On May 25, 2017, Dennis Christensen was the first brother to be arrested following the Supreme Court ban. He has been in detention since then.

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:53.470
After over 20 court sessions, his trial continues. On July 17, 2017, the Supreme Court rejected our appeal against the ban.

00:05:53.470 --> 00:06:04.470
On December 14, 2017, authorities broke into the assembly hall in St. Petersburg and took control of the property.

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:15.470
Legal proceedings to seize hundreds of kingdom halls have begun. The branch property is now officially registered in the name of the Russian Federation.

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:27.470
On December 20, 2017, the Leningrad Regional Court upheld an earlier ruling that declared the New World Translation extremist.

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:45.339
And it just continues. Just look at these faces. These are the faces of some of the 71 brothers and sisters who are presently under criminal investigation in Russia.

00:06:45.339 --> 00:06:53.339
21 are presently imprisoned. 15 more are under house arrest.

00:06:53.339 --> 00:07:02.339
Now, brothers, what can we say about all of these events that have taken place in such a short period of time?

00:07:02.339 --> 00:07:12.339
Well, truly, if you're a student of the history of God's organization, you can say these events are unprecedented in our history.

00:07:12.339 --> 00:07:21.339
We have never seen a country or a territory with 175,000 witnesses of Jehovah go under ban.

00:07:21.339 --> 00:07:32.339
We've not seen such a large branch seized by a government as well as all of our kingdom halls and even declaring the New World Translation extremist.

00:07:32.339 --> 00:07:37.339
Well, then based on all of these events, what can we say?

00:07:37.339 --> 00:07:52.339
The governing body believes that these and other actions of Russia and its allies constitute a part of the fulfillment of the king of the North entering the land of decoration.

00:07:52.339 --> 00:08:05.339
Well, now what can we expect? It would not be surprising if Russia and its allies continue to persecute God's people and that that persecution spreads to other lands.

00:08:05.339 --> 00:08:20.339
Already just a little more than one week ago on September 26, 2018, the Supreme Court of the Donetsk People's Republic, that's one of the breakaway republics from Ukraine,

00:08:20.339 --> 00:08:27.339
declared the religious association of Jehovah's Witnesses to be extremist.

00:08:27.339 --> 00:08:32.340
When our brothers, this raises a very important question.

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:39.840
Does this mean that the attack of Gog of May Gog has begun?

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:49.440
Well, we're not ready to tell you. Pay attention. The annual meeting is not yet over.

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:55.440
By the end of this meeting, you will have the answer to that important question.

00:08:55.440 --> 00:09:00.440
But let's come back to our question. Are you ready?

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:16.440
Of course, we want to be ready when persecution comes. And quite frankly, brothers, when ban or opposition comes on a level like we have seen in Russia, there are things that we need to know in order to be ready.

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:19.440
Let's consider four.

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:27.440
The first, we must follow direction from Jehovah's Organization. Hebrews chapter 13 verse 17 says,

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:33.440
be obedient to those taking the lead among you and why?

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:43.440
Because Jehovah will use his appointed channel to provide us with the direction that we need so that we can maintain our spirituality.

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:56.440
And, brothers, it is vital that we adhere to that direction closely in order to preserve our spirituality and the spirituality of others who may worship with us.

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:59.440
Here's the second.

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:07.440
Don't panic. Trust in Jehovah. And don't ban yourself.

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:13.440
Now, what does Deuteronomy chapter 7 and verse 21 tell us about our opposers?

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:19.440
It says, do not be struck with terror because of them.

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:26.440
For Jehovah, your God is with you a great and awe-inspiring God.

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:31.440
You see, our opposers would love for us to panic.

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:39.440
They would love for us to hear the report that 21 of our brothers are in prison and, as a result, become terrified.

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:44.440
They would like for us to stop meeting together, to stop preaching the good news.

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:50.440
In effect, we could actually ban ourselves.

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:55.440
But what does Isaiah chapter 28 and verse 16 say?

00:10:55.440 --> 00:11:01.440
It says, no one exercising faith will panic.

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:05.440
So, brothers, we must not panic.

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:13.440
Yes, it's true. There are 21 of our dear brothers and sisters in Russia that are in prison at the present time.

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:21.440
But on the other hand, think about how many tens of thousands of our brothers who are not in prison.

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:26.440
You see, that's what we need to focus our minds on.

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:34.440
And what if we do face arrest or imprisonment because we faithfully serve our God, Jehovah?

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:40.440
Then we must remember that Jehovah will be there to support us.

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:44.440
In fact, I would just love to be able to tell you more.

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:51.440
But our brothers in prison in Russia and many other places are doing just fine.

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:57.440
And why are they doing fine? Because Jehovah God is with them.

00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:08.440
There is no prison wall that can be built so high, so wide, or so strong, that it can cut us off from our Heavenly Father, Jehovah.

00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:34.730
Number three, protect your spiritual food.

00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:41.730
Brothers, have a secure place in mind to hide your Bible and other precious spiritual food,

00:12:41.730 --> 00:12:44.730
whether in printed or in electronic form.

00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:49.730
If you're worshiping Jehovah right now in a country where the work is under ban,

00:12:49.730 --> 00:12:57.730
do not leave your spiritual food where it can easily be discovered and taken away.

00:12:58.730 --> 00:13:03.730
Number four, at first Peter, chapter 1, and verse 22,

00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:08.730
the Bible tells us to love one another intensely from the heart.

00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:12.730
And our brothers in countries where the work is under ban or doing just that.

00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:20.730
In many court hearings in Russia, our brothers have risked their safety to be in the courtroom to support their brothers.

00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:25.730
And when the brothers were charged and when they emerged from the courtroom,

00:13:25.730 --> 00:13:29.730
what did those brothers who were there to support them do? Just watch.

00:13:29.730 --> 00:14:24.720
Are you determined, brothers and sisters, to be like our brothers and sisters in Russia,

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:31.720
and to stand together as one and support one another through the challenging times that will be coming in the future?

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:50.330
Then remember these practical steps. Follow direction.

00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:55.330
Don't panic. Trust in Jehovah and don't ban yourself.

00:14:55.330 --> 00:15:01.330
Protect your spiritual food and support your brothers and sisters.

00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:04.330
Stand together with them as one.

00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:09.330
If we are all determined to do these practical things right now,

00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:13.330
then my dear brothers and sisters, you are ready.

00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:36.799
Thank you so much, brothers and sisters, and for lighting that fire under us.

00:15:36.799 --> 00:15:39.799
In a good way.

00:15:39.799 --> 00:15:48.799
And also, thank you so much for removing the veil concerning the King of the North entering the land of the decoration.

00:15:48.799 --> 00:15:52.799
But now we'd like to say, if at all possible,

00:15:52.799 --> 00:15:55.799
do not go to the restroom during this next talk.

00:15:55.799 --> 00:16:06.500
If you do, you're going to really miss something.

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:12.500
So, brother Jeffrey Jackson is going to give us the powerful top now.

00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:17.500
They will have to know that I am Jehovah.

00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:24.379
So we're all thinking of that very important question.

00:16:24.379 --> 00:16:29.379
Has the attack of Gog of May Gog already started?

00:16:29.379 --> 00:16:34.379
The simple answer is no. Not yet.

00:16:34.379 --> 00:16:36.379
Why can we say that?

00:16:36.379 --> 00:16:39.379
Well, if you turn with me again to Daniel chapter 11,

00:16:39.379 --> 00:16:43.379
and I'm sure many of us will be turning there in the next few weeks,

00:16:43.379 --> 00:16:48.379
thinking over and over again about the significance of these explanations.

00:16:48.379 --> 00:16:58.379
You'll notice what is happening now is part of the fulfillment of Daniel 11 verse 40 through 43.

00:16:58.379 --> 00:17:03.379
But you'll also notice that it continues on with verses 44 and 45.

00:17:03.379 --> 00:17:11.380
Now these two verses apply to something that will occur after the start of the Great Tribulation.

00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:16.380
And as we've understood up to now and continue to understand,

00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:23.380
the attack of Gog of May Gog does not occur before the outbreak of the Great Tribulation.

00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:29.380
In fact, it doesn't even start just as the Great Tribulation commences.

00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:34.380
But rather, it is toward the end of the Great Tribulation.

00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:38.380
So what do we know about the attack of Gog of May Gog?

00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:41.380
What will lead up to that?

00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:46.380
Well, let's consider this visual timeline to help us.

00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:53.289
Over the centuries, Babel on the Great,

00:17:53.289 --> 00:17:56.289
the world empire of false religion,

00:17:56.289 --> 00:18:00.289
has committed spiritual immorality with the kings of the earth.

00:18:00.289 --> 00:18:09.660
In the near future, these religious leaders could very well have a part in causing people to say

00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:13.660
that they have attained a measure of peace and security.

00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:15.660
What happens next?

00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:23.970
Jehovah will put it into the hearts of the nations to empower the United Nations to attack Babel on the Great.

00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:31.140
The Great Tribulation starts at this point.

00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:37.140
However, this will not be the attack of Gog of May Gog on God's people.

00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:41.019
How do we know?

00:18:41.019 --> 00:18:47.019
Jesus said that the days of this initial attack would be cut short on the kind of the chosen ones.

00:18:47.019 --> 00:18:51.019
That is, Jesus spurred anointed brothers still on earth.

00:18:51.019 --> 00:18:56.450
During all these events,

00:18:56.450 --> 00:19:02.450
Jehovah's people will continue to enjoy the spiritual prosperity that they have experienced

00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:08.700
ever since pure worship was reestablished in 1919.

00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:12.700
But whatever respite we may experience at that time,

00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:24.710
will only be the calm before the storm, the final storm.

00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:28.710
Our spiritual prosperity will not go unnoticed.

00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:30.710
How can it?

00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:34.710
All other religious organizations will have been destroyed.

00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:40.710
We will be the only ones on this planet who are openly serving God.

00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:43.960
Gog of May Gog.

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:46.960
A coalition of all the nations.

00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:50.960
Yes, a combination of the King of the North, the King of the South,

00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:56.960
and all other nations will make plans to attack God's people.

00:19:56.960 --> 00:20:00.960
At that time, we will stand out as different

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:03.960
and will appear to be defenseless.

00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:18.400
For this reason, Gog will devise an evil plan in a futile attempt to wipe out pure worship from the earth.

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:25.400
But in his rage, Gog will not take into consideration one vital fact.

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:32.220
His attack on God's people is an attack on Jehovah himself.

00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:35.220
What a mistake that will be.

00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:39.220
Gog will enrage the sovereign of the universe.

00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:42.220
Almighty God.

00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:47.730
This will start the battle of Armageddon.

00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:50.730
During the war of the great day of God Almighty,

00:20:50.730 --> 00:20:54.730
Jehovah will use his heavenly forces.

00:20:54.730 --> 00:21:00.730
Included among these will be all of the 144,000

00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:05.730
who by that time will have received their heavenly reward.

00:21:05.730 --> 00:21:08.730
Then, in a spectacular way,

00:21:08.730 --> 00:21:14.730
Jehovah will no doubt unleash both natural and supernatural forces

00:21:14.730 --> 00:21:19.730
to protect his loyal servants and eliminate his enemies.

00:21:19.730 --> 00:21:30.799
That destruction of the wicked will usher in the thousand-year reign of Jesus Christ.

00:21:30.799 --> 00:21:34.799
After the final test at the end of the thousand years,

00:21:34.799 --> 00:21:36.799
what will be the situation?

00:21:39.049 --> 00:21:44.049
All creation in heaven and on earth will be completely united

00:21:44.049 --> 00:21:50.049
in the pure worship of our loving heavenly Father Jehovah.

00:21:50.049 --> 00:21:52.049
Hallelujah.

00:21:52.049 --> 00:21:54.049
What a time that will be.

00:21:54.049 --> 00:22:20.930
We look forward to the time when you're there and you'll say,

00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:22.930
this is it.

00:22:22.930 --> 00:22:26.930
But in the meantime, as we think to the future

00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:31.930
and we realize that God of May, God will attack God's people.

00:22:31.930 --> 00:22:34.930
This coalition of all the nations of the earth,

00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:37.930
the Kingdom of the North and the Kingdom of the South,

00:22:37.930 --> 00:22:39.930
should we dread anything?

00:22:39.930 --> 00:22:41.930
Should we be fearful about that?

00:22:41.930 --> 00:22:46.930
Well, let's turn to the book of Ezekiel, Ezekiel chapter 38.

00:22:46.930 --> 00:22:50.930
And let's read for ourselves the reassurance that we get from these words.

00:22:51.930 --> 00:22:56.930
Ezekiel 38, let's start with verses 18 and 19.

00:22:56.930 --> 00:23:01.930
On that day, the day when God invades the land of Israel,

00:23:01.930 --> 00:23:03.930
declares the sovereign Lord Jehovah,

00:23:03.930 --> 00:23:06.930
my great rage will flare up.

00:23:06.930 --> 00:23:11.930
In my zeal, in the fire of my fury, I will speak.

00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:16.930
And in that day, there will be a great earthquake in the land of Israel.

00:23:16.930 --> 00:23:19.930
Then verses 21 through 23.

00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:24.930
I will call for a sword against him and all my mountains,

00:23:24.930 --> 00:23:26.930
declares the sovereign Lord Jehovah.

00:23:26.930 --> 00:23:30.930
Every man's sword will be against his own brother.

00:23:30.930 --> 00:23:35.930
I will bring my judgment against him with pestilence and bloodshed,

00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:39.930
and I will rain down a torrential downpour and hellstones,

00:23:39.930 --> 00:23:43.930
and fire, and sulfur on him, and on his troops,

00:23:43.930 --> 00:23:46.930
and on the many peoples with him.

00:23:46.930 --> 00:23:51.930
But I will certainly magnify myself and sanctify myself

00:23:51.930 --> 00:23:56.930
and make myself known before the eyes of many nations,

00:23:56.930 --> 00:24:01.930
and they will have to know that I am Jehovah.

00:24:01.930 --> 00:24:04.930
Aren't those words reassuring?

00:24:04.930 --> 00:24:09.930
Yes, Jehovah will turn his rage on God of my God,

00:24:09.930 --> 00:24:15.930
because he upholds his name and protects his name people.

00:24:15.930 --> 00:24:18.930
So we have nothing to dread.

00:24:18.930 --> 00:24:23.930
Over the past few years, you probably noticed that a number of the annual meetings

00:24:23.930 --> 00:24:28.930
we've had some clarifications with regard to the prophecy of Ezekiel.

00:24:28.930 --> 00:24:34.930
Wouldn't it be nice if we had all those clarifications together in one location?

00:24:34.930 --> 00:24:39.930
Well, you'll be pleased to know ten years ago.

00:24:39.930 --> 00:24:44.930
In the year 2008, the governing body commission, the writing committee,

00:24:44.930 --> 00:24:48.930
to stop preparing a book on the prophecy of Ezekiel.

00:24:48.930 --> 00:24:57.400
Of course, in the meantime, the text of the book of Ezekiel was refined and revised,

00:24:57.400 --> 00:25:02.400
and many, many things have happened on the world scene.

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:04.400
Do we have to wait another ten years?

00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:07.400
I'm not even going to go down that track with you.

00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:12.400
You'll be pleased to know that today we're releasing a brand new publication,

00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:16.400
the pure worship of Jehovah restored at last.

00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:42.519
Now, you all seem very excited about this. All you saw is a front cover.

00:25:42.519 --> 00:25:47.519
What can we expect when we open the pages of this new publication?

00:25:47.519 --> 00:25:54.519
Well, let's take a sneak preview of what you'll find in this publication.

00:25:54.519 --> 00:26:01.519
First of all, you'll be happy to see that it contains all the recent clarifications

00:26:01.519 --> 00:26:06.519
that we've had with regard to our understanding of the book of Ezekiel.

00:26:06.519 --> 00:26:11.519
And we can say there are a few more clarifications as well in this book,

00:26:11.519 --> 00:26:16.519
the pure worship of Jehovah restored at last.

00:26:16.519 --> 00:26:24.519
On pages 238 through 240, you will find a summary of clarifications,

00:26:24.519 --> 00:26:29.519
so no doubt most of us will be turning their first to read through those.

00:26:30.519 --> 00:26:36.519
Numerous charts and timelines appear throughout the book.

00:26:36.519 --> 00:26:43.519
The teaching boxes help us gain a deeper understanding of Ezekiel and his writings.

00:26:43.519 --> 00:26:52.569
These are designed to help us to get the overall background and setting of these prophecies.

00:26:52.569 --> 00:26:57.569
Scattered throughout this book are beautiful illustrations,

00:26:57.569 --> 00:27:07.569
illustrations that bring to life the fascinating prophecies that Ezekiel was inspired to record all for our benefit.

00:27:07.569 --> 00:27:11.569
As you meditate on these instructive pieces of art,

00:27:11.569 --> 00:27:17.569
you will no doubt start to visualize for yourselves the exciting visions

00:27:17.569 --> 00:27:44.740
and the amazing things that Ezekiel describes in this prophetic book.

00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:49.740
Brother Lett will tell you when you'll receive your copies.

00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:51.740
Now I know all of you thinking at this point,

00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:56.740
okay, you can go now, we'd like to hear when we're going to get them.

00:27:56.740 --> 00:27:59.740
But before we finish this part,

00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:07.740
we'd like to mention that in the digital version of this publication, there's a new feature.

00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:10.740
There are 22 chapters in the book,

00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:17.740
but at the beginning of each chapter, there's a little video clip that introduces the chapter.

00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:24.740
And these video clips are presented by either members of the governing body or helpers to the governing body.

00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:27.740
Would you like to see a little summary of some of those?

00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:43.619
Pure worship of Jehovah, restored at last.

00:28:43.619 --> 00:28:47.619
What spiritual gems will we find in this book?

00:28:47.619 --> 00:28:50.619
Will there be clarifications of understanding?

00:28:50.619 --> 00:28:52.619
Yes.

00:28:52.619 --> 00:28:56.619
Will we see beautiful illustrations of vivid prophetic visions?

00:28:56.619 --> 00:29:00.619
Yes. The better you understand Bible principles,

00:29:00.619 --> 00:29:08.619
the greater will be your desire to reject Satan's traps and to give Jehovah exclusive pure worship.

00:29:08.619 --> 00:29:17.619
Why do the faces of a man, a lion, a bowl, and an eagle especially reflect Jehovah's strength and mightiness?

00:29:17.619 --> 00:29:21.619
What does the chariot that Ezekiel saw represent?

00:29:21.619 --> 00:29:23.619
And how do we know that?

00:29:23.619 --> 00:29:27.619
What promises of restoration did Jehovah make through Ezekiel?

00:29:27.619 --> 00:29:32.619
And how had they been fulfilled on true Christians during the last days?

00:29:32.619 --> 00:29:38.619
What can we learn from Ezekiel's prophecy about Jerusalem's destruction?

00:29:38.619 --> 00:29:45.619
How does Ezekiel's vision of the man with the secretaries in corn highlight Jehovah's mercy?

00:29:46.619 --> 00:29:52.619
What lies ahead for false religion and what actions should we take now?

00:29:52.619 --> 00:29:56.619
Jehovah asked the prophet Ezekiel to do some strange things,

00:29:56.619 --> 00:30:01.619
but they conveyed an important message that has meaning for us today.

00:30:01.619 --> 00:30:06.619
Do you enjoy picturing yourself and your loved ones in paradise?

00:30:06.619 --> 00:30:13.619
A study of Ezekiel's visionary river will help you to make that picture even more vivid.

00:30:13.619 --> 00:30:21.619
It's true that understanding Bible prophecy requires humility, hard work, and Holy Spirit,

00:30:21.619 --> 00:30:24.619
but the rewards are worth the effort.

00:30:24.619 --> 00:30:27.619
The material you're about to discuss will give you courage,

00:30:27.619 --> 00:30:32.619
and it will help you to do your part in upholding pure worship.

00:30:32.619 --> 00:30:38.619
The better you understand this material, the stronger your determination will be

00:30:38.619 --> 00:30:42.619
to give Jehovah pure worship.

00:30:42.619 --> 00:30:46.619
We now hope that what you've learned from the pure worship book

00:30:46.619 --> 00:30:53.619
will strengthen your determination to give Jehovah what he so richly deserves.

00:30:53.619 --> 00:30:55.619
Your exclusive worship.

00:30:55.619 --> 00:31:11.609
May this new publication enhance our appreciation for pure worship.

00:31:11.609 --> 00:31:18.609
May it continue to build within us a feeling of urgency with regard to the times in which we're living,

00:31:18.609 --> 00:31:24.609
and may it help us to have a longing for the time when all creation in heaven and earth

00:31:24.609 --> 00:31:30.609
will not only know Jehovah, but love and worship him for all eternity.

00:31:30.609 --> 00:31:53.140
What a powerful part, Brother Jackson, and we thank you very much.

00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:58.140
And thank you for removing the veil from God,

00:31:58.140 --> 00:32:05.140
a coalition of nations including the King of the North and the King of the South.

00:32:06.140 --> 00:32:12.140
But now regarding our wonderful publication for the Jackson told you about,

00:32:12.140 --> 00:32:16.140
and he put the pressure on me, I gotta give you the right announcement this time.

00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:19.140
So here's the right announcement.

00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:26.140
The pure worship book in English will be made available on JW.org,

00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:34.140
Watchtower Online Library and JW Library on Monday, October the 8th, 2018.

00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:37.140
So Monday's gonna be a big day.

00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:42.140
If you will be making use of a hard copy of this publication,

00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:52.140
one copy of the printed edition will be available after the program at the various annual meeting locations,

00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:59.140
including the main lobby of your complex for those watching from their personal rooms.

00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:05.140
Additional printed copies may be requested through the congregations,

00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:09.140
including the large print edition.

00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:13.140
But now we move to our final talk.

00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:17.140
And Brother David's plan is gonna give us this comforting talk.

00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:22.140
Do not be anxious for I am your God.

00:33:22.140 --> 00:33:26.140
And Jehovah knows we need this comforting talk

00:33:26.140 --> 00:33:32.140
after the powerful preceding trilogy we just heard.

00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:37.259
So Brother's playing, please.

00:33:37.259 --> 00:33:47.589
I told some of the brothers that my job is to cheer you up after the preceding talks.

00:33:47.589 --> 00:33:53.349
Well, bad things happen.

00:33:53.349 --> 00:33:59.349
They happen to us, and they happen to those we love.

00:33:59.349 --> 00:34:06.349
So here's the question, is it possible to remain calm

00:34:06.349 --> 00:34:10.349
when it seems that our life is being turned upside down?

00:34:10.349 --> 00:34:12.349
And the answer is yes.

00:34:12.349 --> 00:34:17.349
And let's consider four reasons why we say that.

00:34:17.349 --> 00:34:22.349
And this is simple because all of these reasons are contained in one Bible verse,

00:34:22.349 --> 00:34:27.349
Isaiah chapter 41 and verse 10.

00:34:27.349 --> 00:34:30.349
That's Isaiah chapter 41.

00:34:30.349 --> 00:34:39.920
If you can't find Isaiah, try Isaiah chapter 41 verse 10.

00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:43.920
Four reasons why we can become.

00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:48.920
It says, do not be afraid for I am with you.

00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:53.920
Do not be anxious for I am your God.

00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:55.920
I will fortify you.

00:34:55.920 --> 00:34:58.920
Yes, I will help you.

00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:04.920
I will really hold on to you with my right hand of righteousness.

00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:06.920
You can leave your Bibles open.

00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:10.920
We're going to be returning to this book, and we're going to be staying in Isaiah

00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:13.920
for the duration of this talk.

00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:18.920
Now, more than 100 years after these words were written down,

00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:23.920
a very bad thing happened.

00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:28.920
The King of Babylon invaded the city of Jerusalem.

00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:36.920
And the Bible says of him that he felt no compassion for young man or virgin, old or infirm.

00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:41.920
He burned down the house of the true God, tore down the wall of Jerusalem,

00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:49.920
burned all its fortified towers with fire, and destroyed everything of value.

00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:52.920
Now, there were survivors.

00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:57.920
Bear in mind, we're not talking about our friends, Daniel, Ezekiel, Shade Rack,

00:35:57.920 --> 00:35:58.920
Meshach and Abednego.

00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:01.920
They were already in Babylon, but there were survivors.

00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:07.920
But can you picture in your mind's eye what was happening to the survivors?

00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:10.920
Just try to picture it.

00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:17.920
There they are, bound in chains, being dragged through the rubble,

00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:20.920
the smoldering rubble of the Holy City.

00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:24.550
Can you see them?

00:36:24.550 --> 00:36:32.550
Can you see them pass a widow who is cradling the lifeless body of her only son?

00:36:32.550 --> 00:36:38.550
Now a soldier approaches, and he orders the woman to drop her son and get on her feet.

00:36:38.550 --> 00:36:39.550
But she can't.

00:36:39.550 --> 00:36:51.550
She just can't let go of her son, her precious son, with one stroke, the soldier ends her life.

00:36:51.550 --> 00:36:55.550
And those looking on wonder what fate awaits them.

00:36:55.550 --> 00:37:06.550
And you can imagine faithful ones among them, repeating the words of Jehovah by means of Isaiah over and over again.

00:37:06.550 --> 00:37:08.550
Do not be anxious.

00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:11.550
Do not be anxious.

00:37:11.550 --> 00:37:13.550
I am your God.

00:37:13.550 --> 00:37:16.550
I will fortify you.

00:37:16.550 --> 00:37:19.550
I will hold on to you.

00:37:19.550 --> 00:37:26.550
Well, those same words have been a source of great encouragement to Jehovah's people throughout the ages,

00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:29.550
and they can be a source of strength for us today.

00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:33.550
So let's take a closer look at Isaiah chapter 41 and verse 10,

00:37:33.550 --> 00:37:40.550
and discuss the four reasons why we needn't be overly anxious when bad things happen.

00:37:40.550 --> 00:37:46.550
So keep your Bibles open to Isaiah, and let's look at the first reason.

00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:51.550
What does Jehovah say for I am with you?

00:37:51.550 --> 00:37:55.550
Now what's the first word in that phrase?

00:37:55.550 --> 00:37:57.550
I.

00:37:57.550 --> 00:38:01.550
Jehovah doesn't say, don't be anxious because you're a real smart.

00:38:01.550 --> 00:38:03.550
You'll figure something out.

00:38:03.550 --> 00:38:05.550
No.

00:38:05.550 --> 00:38:09.550
We needn't be anxious if Jehovah is with us.

00:38:09.550 --> 00:38:15.550
If we put our trust completely in Jehovah, that's the very best way to calm our fears.

00:38:16.550 --> 00:38:21.550
And that's been repeated to us during the program of this convention.

00:38:21.550 --> 00:38:25.550
And now, isn't Jehovah just interested in the big picture?

00:38:25.550 --> 00:38:30.550
Is Jehovah really interested in you and your problems?

00:38:30.550 --> 00:38:33.550
Yeah, sure, is the Israelites that he is.

00:38:33.550 --> 00:38:41.550
Just turn to Isaiah 43, and notice what he says in verse 2.

00:38:41.550 --> 00:38:51.789
He's speaking to you, when you pass through the waters, I will be with you.

00:38:51.789 --> 00:38:55.789
And through the rivers, they will not flood over you.

00:38:55.789 --> 00:38:59.789
When you walk through the fire, you will not be scorched.

00:38:59.789 --> 00:39:03.789
Nor will the flame sing you.

00:39:03.789 --> 00:39:07.789
Now, Jehovah doesn't say there won't be challenges.

00:39:07.789 --> 00:39:12.789
There will be rivers, but Jehovah will not allow those rivers to flood over us.

00:39:13.789 --> 00:39:21.789
There will be fire, but Jehovah will not allow the flames to consume us.

00:39:21.789 --> 00:39:26.789
Jehovah has the power over fire and water.

00:39:26.789 --> 00:39:28.789
And Jehovah says that he will be with us.

00:39:28.789 --> 00:39:31.789
So we will leave every trial.

00:39:31.789 --> 00:39:37.789
We will go out of every trial with our integrity intact with the help of Jehovah.

00:39:37.789 --> 00:39:39.789
But Jehovah does something else.

00:39:39.789 --> 00:39:46.789
Jehovah can also help quiet our fears, so that we're not afraid of the trials that be set us.

00:39:46.789 --> 00:39:51.789
Now, this was evident in the case of a sister named Yoshiko.

00:39:51.789 --> 00:39:55.789
The doctor gave her very bad news.

00:39:55.789 --> 00:39:58.789
She had only a few months to live.

00:39:58.789 --> 00:40:01.789
But Jehovah was with her.

00:40:01.789 --> 00:40:05.789
What did he do? Did he provide a miraculous cure?

00:40:05.789 --> 00:40:08.789
No. Her daughter said,

00:40:08.789 --> 00:40:13.789
we were impressed with how calm Mom was.

00:40:13.789 --> 00:40:17.789
We truly saw that Jehovah gave her inner peace.

00:40:17.789 --> 00:40:27.789
Well, I'm sure you could relate many, many experiences where Jehovah has given you that same piece of God that has helped you to endure trials.

00:40:27.789 --> 00:40:29.789
Now, let's note the second reason.

00:40:29.789 --> 00:40:32.789
Go back to Isaiah 41, 10.

00:40:32.789 --> 00:40:36.789
And let's note the second reason why we can remain calm.

00:40:37.789 --> 00:40:43.789
He says, do not be anxious for I am your God.

00:40:43.789 --> 00:40:50.789
Now, in this verse, the word for be anxious, conveys the thought of looking over your shoulder and expecting trouble,

00:40:50.789 --> 00:40:53.789
or being in a constant state of alarm.

00:40:53.789 --> 00:40:56.789
Now, is that really helpful?

00:40:56.789 --> 00:41:00.789
Reminds me of the American writer Mark Twain.

00:41:00.789 --> 00:41:05.789
He said, I'm an old man, and I've known many troubles.

00:41:05.789 --> 00:41:08.789
Most of it never happened.

00:41:08.789 --> 00:41:10.789
And that's really true, isn't it?

00:41:10.789 --> 00:41:15.789
So often, the things that we expect to happen, the things that we worry about, don't happen at all.

00:41:15.789 --> 00:41:17.789
What was the point?

00:41:17.789 --> 00:41:22.789
Nothing is gained by trying to imagine what a form persecution might take,

00:41:22.789 --> 00:41:25.789
or how we might react under a certain trial.

00:41:25.789 --> 00:41:26.789
Why?

00:41:26.789 --> 00:41:32.789
Because we know our God, and we know what Jehovah can do for us.

00:41:32.789 --> 00:41:34.789
How do we know that?

00:41:34.789 --> 00:41:36.789
Because of His past record.

00:41:36.789 --> 00:41:40.789
We've seen how He has already intervened in our life.

00:41:40.789 --> 00:41:43.789
He's done it before, and He can do it again.

00:41:43.789 --> 00:41:45.789
Remember the song?

00:41:45.789 --> 00:41:48.789
You promised Him in prayer to do His will.

00:41:48.789 --> 00:41:52.789
He helped you then, and He will help you still.

00:41:52.789 --> 00:41:54.789
And that is so true.

00:41:54.789 --> 00:41:58.789
Now, think about the first trial that you encountered when you were coming into the truth.

00:41:58.789 --> 00:42:01.789
Maybe it was your relatives.

00:42:01.789 --> 00:42:07.789
You were studying, and you were wondering how you were going to break the news to your relatives

00:42:07.789 --> 00:42:10.789
that you were studying with Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:42:10.789 --> 00:42:18.789
And you begged Jehovah to give you just the right words so that you'd know how to break the news.

00:42:18.789 --> 00:42:21.789
It didn't go well.

00:42:21.789 --> 00:42:26.139
And you felt as if you were walking through fire.

00:42:26.139 --> 00:42:28.139
But did the fire consume you?

00:42:28.139 --> 00:42:31.139
Oh, no, look at you. You're here.

00:42:31.139 --> 00:42:33.139
Jehovah helped you.

00:42:33.139 --> 00:42:37.139
He gave you the peace of God, and He helped you to endure.

00:42:37.139 --> 00:42:41.139
And now you have a better relationship with your relatives,

00:42:41.139 --> 00:42:45.510
as long as you don't talk about the truth.

00:42:45.510 --> 00:42:49.510
He helped you then, and He will help you still.

00:42:49.510 --> 00:42:53.510
Well, looking back, you might not see that as a very difficult test,

00:42:53.510 --> 00:42:56.510
because since that time you've been through a lot worse.

00:42:56.510 --> 00:42:59.510
But it was a test, nevertheless.

00:42:59.510 --> 00:43:01.510
And you passed that test successfully.

00:43:01.510 --> 00:43:04.510
And so, when you went through much worse later,

00:43:04.510 --> 00:43:08.510
you were able to encounter that test and pass it, because your faith was stronger.

00:43:08.510 --> 00:43:13.510
Jehovah has built your faith little by little.

00:43:13.510 --> 00:43:16.510
Now, Jehovah won't always remove our problems.

00:43:16.510 --> 00:43:21.510
If you have a problem, and there's something you can do about it,

00:43:21.510 --> 00:43:24.510
then pray for wisdom.

00:43:24.510 --> 00:43:28.510
If there's nothing you can do about the problem, pray for peace.

00:43:28.510 --> 00:43:31.510
But in any case, pray.

00:43:31.510 --> 00:43:37.510
The next best thing to solving a problem is not to be worried about the problem.

00:43:37.510 --> 00:43:44.510
Now, let's go back to verse 10, and consider the third assurance that we get from Jehovah.

00:43:44.510 --> 00:43:47.510
He says, I will fortify you.

00:43:47.510 --> 00:43:51.510
Yes, I will help you.

00:43:51.510 --> 00:43:54.510
Now, what does that word fortify mean?

00:43:54.510 --> 00:43:57.510
It means to make us stronger.

00:43:57.510 --> 00:44:04.510
Now, this morning, we've heard a lot that could be scary on some levels.

00:44:04.510 --> 00:44:11.510
And we might catch ourselves saying, I don't think I'd do it very well under persecution.

00:44:11.510 --> 00:44:14.510
What's wrong with that statement?

00:44:14.510 --> 00:44:21.510
I don't think I would do well under persecution.

00:44:21.510 --> 00:44:25.510
Jehovah's not in the picture, and yet he should be.

00:44:25.510 --> 00:44:29.510
He says, we have to face persecution alone.

00:44:29.510 --> 00:44:33.510
Jehovah says that he is going to fortify us.

00:44:33.510 --> 00:44:38.510
He is going to give us the inner strength that we didn't know we had

00:44:38.510 --> 00:44:42.510
because we don't have it if we're not facing persecution.

00:44:42.510 --> 00:44:47.510
You may not be strong enough to encounter persecution now if you're not going through it.

00:44:47.510 --> 00:44:54.510
But when the time comes, and it will come, Jehovah will give you the strength you need.

00:44:54.510 --> 00:44:57.510
He says, I will fortify you.

00:44:57.510 --> 00:45:00.510
I will make you strong.

00:45:00.510 --> 00:45:04.510
Well, let's consider the last phrase in verse 10.

00:45:04.510 --> 00:45:10.510
Jehovah says, I will really hold on to you with my right hand of righteousness.

00:45:10.510 --> 00:45:15.510
Now, the watchtower of July 2016 clarified this verse for us.

00:45:15.510 --> 00:45:22.510
We used to often think of ourselves walking hand in hand with Jehovah.

00:45:22.510 --> 00:45:25.510
But that's not really what he's talking about.

00:45:25.510 --> 00:45:26.510
How do we know?

00:45:26.510 --> 00:45:30.510
Well, it's because of what he says in verse 13.

00:45:30.510 --> 00:45:37.510
It says, for I, Jehovah, your God, am grasping your right hand.

00:45:37.510 --> 00:45:40.510
But what does he say at the end of verse 10?

00:45:40.510 --> 00:45:45.510
I will hold on to you with my right hand of righteousness.

00:45:45.510 --> 00:45:50.510
If we were walking side by side with Jehovah, our right hand would be in his left hand.

00:45:50.510 --> 00:45:52.510
Our left hand would be in his right hand.

00:45:52.510 --> 00:45:58.510
But he says, no, I will hold on to you with my right hand and I will hold on to your right hand.

00:45:58.510 --> 00:46:00.510
So what is the picture?

00:46:00.510 --> 00:46:04.510
You're down and you can't get up.

00:46:04.510 --> 00:46:07.510
And Jehovah God extends his right hand.

00:46:07.510 --> 00:46:09.510
And what do you do?

00:46:09.510 --> 00:46:13.510
Don't just lie there.

00:46:13.510 --> 00:46:15.510
Extend your right hand.

00:46:15.510 --> 00:46:18.510
Allow Jehovah to help you to get up.

00:46:18.510 --> 00:46:21.510
Maybe you're battling depression right now.

00:46:21.510 --> 00:46:28.510
Or perhaps you've lost a cherished privilege of service and you just can't get over it.

00:46:28.510 --> 00:46:33.510
Extend your right hand and allow Jehovah to help you.

00:46:33.510 --> 00:46:36.510
Maybe he'll use an elder as his right hand man.

00:46:36.510 --> 00:46:44.510
But he's going to use somebody to help you if only you are willing to accept the help that Jehovah will give.

00:46:45.510 --> 00:46:47.510
Well, there they are.

00:46:47.510 --> 00:46:52.510
For reasons why we can keep calm, no matter what the future holds.

00:46:52.510 --> 00:46:55.510
Jehovah says, I am with you.

00:46:55.510 --> 00:46:58.510
He says, I am your God.

00:46:58.510 --> 00:47:04.510
I will fortify you and I will hold on to you with my right hand.

00:47:04.510 --> 00:47:07.510
What a beautiful assurance that is.

00:47:07.510 --> 00:47:13.510
And we're going to have a whole year to consider these words in depth.

00:47:13.510 --> 00:47:17.510
Because part of this text, as you have probably guessed,

00:47:17.510 --> 00:47:23.889
constitutes our year text for the year 2019.

00:47:23.889 --> 00:47:46.610
And here it is, do not be anxious for I am your God.

00:47:46.610 --> 00:47:51.610
Thank you so much, Brothers Plain, for that balsam of Gilead.

00:47:52.610 --> 00:47:57.610
And also we appreciate that year text, Isaiah 4110,

00:47:57.610 --> 00:48:03.610
but a beautiful scripture will focus on during 2019.

00:48:03.610 --> 00:48:10.610
But now I've been apportioned five minutes for some concluding comments.

00:48:10.610 --> 00:48:17.610
And even though we're over time, I'm going to take my five minutes.

00:48:18.610 --> 00:48:30.219
I'll probably hear about it later though from the governing body.

00:48:30.219 --> 00:48:34.219
So if I leave out of here real quick after the program,

00:48:34.219 --> 00:48:38.820
you'll know what the problem is.

00:48:38.820 --> 00:48:41.820
But near the beginning of our program,

00:48:41.820 --> 00:48:48.820
we focus just for a few minutes on appreciating our spiritual paradise.

00:48:48.820 --> 00:48:52.820
And to substantiate how truly parodisec it is,

00:48:52.820 --> 00:48:56.820
we made comparisons between that original paradise,

00:48:56.820 --> 00:48:59.820
our spiritual paradise.

00:48:59.820 --> 00:49:02.820
And we discussed seven similarities.

00:49:02.820 --> 00:49:04.820
Now just to review,

00:49:04.820 --> 00:49:08.820
our spiritual paradise, like the Garden of Eden, exists on a land.

00:49:08.820 --> 00:49:12.820
It is filled with beautiful plants and trees.

00:49:12.820 --> 00:49:16.820
It has abundant food and refreshing water.

00:49:16.820 --> 00:49:19.820
It has many harmless animals.

00:49:19.820 --> 00:49:24.820
It needs maintenance and it has boundaries.

00:49:24.820 --> 00:49:28.820
But just briefly, let's discuss one more,

00:49:28.820 --> 00:49:30.820
an eighth similarity.

00:49:30.820 --> 00:49:39.820
Our spiritual paradise is expanding to embrace more and more people.

00:49:39.820 --> 00:49:43.820
Originally, Jehovah intended the Garden of Eden to expand, didn't he?

00:49:43.820 --> 00:49:46.820
We know that Jehovah told him,

00:49:46.820 --> 00:49:49.820
and Genesis 128 become fruitful,

00:49:49.820 --> 00:49:51.820
become many.

00:49:51.820 --> 00:49:54.820
Fill the earth and subdue it.

00:49:54.820 --> 00:49:57.820
So as Adam and Eve had children,

00:49:57.820 --> 00:50:00.820
as their children had children,

00:50:00.820 --> 00:50:03.820
the Garden of Eden would become too small eventually,

00:50:03.820 --> 00:50:05.820
it would have to grow.

00:50:05.820 --> 00:50:08.820
It would have to expand, bigger and bigger.

00:50:08.820 --> 00:50:11.820
And finally, the east would meet the west,

00:50:11.820 --> 00:50:13.820
the north would meet the south,

00:50:13.820 --> 00:50:16.820
the planet earth would become the Garden of Eden.

00:50:16.820 --> 00:50:19.820
But now we know that original procedure,

00:50:19.820 --> 00:50:21.820
Jehovah had in mind,

00:50:21.820 --> 00:50:24.820
you could say was blocked by the rebellion in the Garden of Eden.

00:50:24.820 --> 00:50:27.820
Of course, Jehovah's original purpose,

00:50:27.820 --> 00:50:30.820
for the earth to be a paradise like the Garden of Eden,

00:50:30.820 --> 00:50:32.820
certainly will be accomplished.

00:50:32.820 --> 00:50:34.820
But now, here is the point.

00:50:34.820 --> 00:50:38.820
Just as Jehovah intended the Garden of Eden to expand,

00:50:38.820 --> 00:50:43.820
he desires our spiritual paradise to expand,

00:50:43.820 --> 00:50:46.820
to embrace more and more people.

00:50:46.820 --> 00:50:48.820
And that definitely is happening, isn't it?

00:50:48.820 --> 00:50:52.820
As all of us focus on making disciples,

00:50:52.820 --> 00:50:56.820
and right now our spiritual paradise embraces

00:50:56.820 --> 00:51:00.820
some eight and a half million sheep-like individuals.

00:51:00.820 --> 00:51:04.820
And only Jehovah knows how many more will come into it

00:51:04.820 --> 00:51:07.820
before the Great Tribulation begins

00:51:07.820 --> 00:51:11.820
as all of us do our best to make disciples.

00:51:11.820 --> 00:51:13.820
And Jehovah expects us to do that,

00:51:13.820 --> 00:51:18.820
to do our very best to expand this spiritual paradise,

00:51:18.820 --> 00:51:21.820
this wonderful, beautiful place where we are.

00:51:21.820 --> 00:51:26.820
And this will happen until we know the spiritual paradise

00:51:26.820 --> 00:51:28.820
will go through the Great Tribulation,

00:51:28.820 --> 00:51:32.820
and then resurrected ones and ones born in the New World

00:51:32.820 --> 00:51:34.820
will come into the spiritual paradise

00:51:34.820 --> 00:51:38.820
if they exercise faith in Jehovah's provisions.

00:51:38.820 --> 00:51:40.820
But there'll be many, it'll do that.

00:51:40.820 --> 00:51:43.820
They'll come into the spiritual paradise that will happen

00:51:43.820 --> 00:51:48.820
over and over again until the spiritual paradise

00:51:48.820 --> 00:51:53.820
will cover the entire planet and this exquisite paradise

00:51:53.820 --> 00:51:57.820
will actually be more beautiful, more exquisite

00:51:57.820 --> 00:52:02.820
than the literal paradise that will coexist with it.

00:52:02.820 --> 00:52:05.820
So there we have eight similarities between

00:52:05.820 --> 00:52:09.820
the original paradise, our spiritual paradise.

00:52:09.820 --> 00:52:11.820
And we never want to take it for granted.

00:52:11.820 --> 00:52:14.820
And as we touched on a little bit in the beginning,

00:52:14.820 --> 00:52:20.820
we never want to allow Satan to do what he did to Adam and Eve.

00:52:20.820 --> 00:52:23.820
He got them out of their wonderful place, didn't he?

00:52:23.820 --> 00:52:27.820
Well, he's trying to lure us out of the boundaries

00:52:27.820 --> 00:52:31.820
of our wonderful exquisite spiritual paradise,

00:52:31.820 --> 00:52:34.820
but we are not going to let him do this.

00:52:34.820 --> 00:52:38.820
And we're determined we're going to help others

00:52:38.820 --> 00:52:42.820
that are of honest heart, join us in this spiritual paradise.

00:52:42.820 --> 00:52:47.820
And this wonderful annual meeting has truly helped us

00:52:47.820 --> 00:52:52.820
in this regard. I know all of us are so happy we were here.

00:52:52.820 --> 00:52:55.820
Now there's many things you could do on a Saturday,

00:52:55.820 --> 00:53:00.070
but we did the best thing we could have done on this Saturday.

00:53:00.070 --> 00:53:05.070
We were here at this wonderful annual meeting.
