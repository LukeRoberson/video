00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:06.070
Out of the over 100,000 publishers in South Korea,

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:11.070
there are more than 40,000 zealous regular pioneers.

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.070
What efforts have they made to reach more people

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.070
in frequently worked territory?

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.070
Let's find out.

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.070
I started pioneering less than a year after I got baptized.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.070
So I was eager to sharpen my preaching skills.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.070
I really wanted to share my hope with others.

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.070
But it's so hard to meet people at their homes during the day.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.070
And even if we do meet them, it's not easy to start a conversation.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:42.070
Our congregation organized convenience store witnessing from 7am to 9am.

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.070
So I thought this might be a good way to reach people

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.070
and have meaningful conversations.

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.670
But the thing is, I'm not a morning person.

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.670
So getting up early was not easy.

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.670
So I had to make some adjustments.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.670
I tried not to make plans or stay up late the night before.

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:08.239
The sample presentations from our meetings were also very helpful.

00:01:08.239 --> 00:01:13.239
In the past, I hardly got the chance to open the Bible while I was preaching.

00:01:13.239 --> 00:01:17.239
But now, I have a few Bible studies.

00:01:17.239 --> 00:01:22.239
Even the time we spend traveling from one convenience store to the next

00:01:22.239 --> 00:01:24.239
is very uplifting spiritually,

00:01:24.239 --> 00:01:27.239
because we use that time to share our preaching skills

00:01:27.239 --> 00:01:29.239
and build each other up.

00:01:29.239 --> 00:01:32.239
Having a regular share in convenience store witnessing

00:01:32.239 --> 00:01:35.239
has allowed me to be more productive in the ministry.

00:01:35.239 --> 00:01:38.239
I feel like I'm progressing spiritually

00:01:38.239 --> 00:01:42.239
and becoming a better minister of the good news.

00:01:42.239 --> 00:01:46.239
On weekdays, I work to support my family.

00:01:46.239 --> 00:01:50.239
So I would usually go out and field service on the weekends.

00:01:50.239 --> 00:01:53.239
But it wasn't easy to find people at their homes

00:01:53.239 --> 00:01:56.239
because they usually make plans and go out.

00:01:56.239 --> 00:02:00.239
And you know, it's hard to get excited about the preaching work

00:02:00.239 --> 00:02:03.239
when you're not meeting many people.

00:02:03.239 --> 00:02:06.239
I wanted to set a good example for my family,

00:02:06.239 --> 00:02:11.240
but I found it a real challenge to maintain my zeal for the ministry.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:16.240
So I began to regularly participate in evening witnessing

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.240
on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Fridays.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.240
I usually get off work around 5 p.m.

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.240
After a long day at work,

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:31.240
it's not always easy to get dressed to go out in the field ministry.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.240
But I kept up with my return visits

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.240
and had some really encouraging experiences.

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.240
A young man I had been visiting accepted a Bible study

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.240
and he's making fine progress.

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:48.240
My children were able to see how much joy I get from the ministry.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.240
And so now, they too are able to give a bold witness

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.240
in their own words, even in the face of opposition.

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.240
I am very proud of my children, training and teaching them

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.240
how to make effective return visits and Bible studies

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.240
brings me great joy.

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:09.240
We serve in a small rural town where many leave home early in the morning

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.240
to work in the field and they return late at night.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:16.240
So it's not easy to find people at home during the daytime.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.240
And even if we do find them at their doors,

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.240
it's not easy to develop a meaningful Bible-based conversation.

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.240
Let alone make return visits and conduct Bible studies with them.

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:30.240
After returning home from preaching at night, I would ask myself,

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.240
did I have a meaningful share in the ministry today?

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.240
It's a small rural town.

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:41.240
So many people are concerned about what their neighbors would think if they talked with us.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.240
So even those who are interested in learning more about the Bible

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:49.240
were reluctant to have Bible discussions with us.

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:53.240
It was really unfortunate.

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:57.240
We tried to figure out the right time to call on people.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:01.240
And we found out that many householders are more relaxed

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:09.240
than willing to talk about the Bible if we visit them around 9 or 10 o'clock in the evening.

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.240
I gave much thought on how I could help my Bible students

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.240
have a regular intake of spiritual food.

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:19.240
One of my students worked from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m.

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:23.240
so I asked her if we can arrange to study early in the morning.

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.240
She agreed.

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.240
I often tell my Bible students,

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:32.240
just call me whenever you have a little time to talk.

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.240
When I get those calls, no matter what time it is,

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.240
it's time to rush out that door.

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:43.290
There was one elderly lady who was in her early 80s

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:47.290
who had attended church all her life.

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:49.290
To accommodate her needs,

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:56.290
I visited her around 9 or 10 o'clock in the evening for our Bible studies.

00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:00.290
I come home feeling tired and hungry,

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:05.290
but the satisfaction of knowing that I've helped her learn more about the truth

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:09.290
enables me to maintain my joy.

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:14.290
Now I'm able to conduct about 12 Bible studies.

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:18.290
I try to become all things to people of all sorts

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:21.290
in order to look after their needs.

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:25.290
And it brings me great satisfaction and joy to see my studies make progress

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:30.290
because that's really how Jehovah wants us to be carrying out our ministry.

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:38.160
You might feel that you've worked every corner of your home territory

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:44.160
but just like a literal fisherman adapts to the time when the fish are biting,

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.160
we need to work when people can be found.

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:51.160
Cast your nets into productive waters.

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:55.160
Our sister arranged her schedule to call on her Bible student

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.160
at 9 or 10 in the evening.

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.160
Of course, we want to use good judgment to call it times

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:05.160
that are both practical and safe for our territory.

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:11.160
But by being adaptable to when, where, or how we preach the good news,

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:16.160
we may yield good results like our fellow witnesses in South Korea.

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:21.160
This will help us to have a meaningful share in the all-important work

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:26.160
of finding those who are rightly disposed for everlasting life.
