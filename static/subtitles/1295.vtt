00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:14.089
In 1946, the first missionaries arrived in Peru and the good news spread quickly in the Spanish

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:20.809
field. However, centuries of mistreatment caused many catch-wa-speaking people to regard

00:00:20.809 --> 00:00:28.449
outsiders with reservation and mistrust. Over the decades, interested ones had to study

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:35.369
in Spanish in order to learn the truth, even if it wasn't their first language. It's true

00:00:35.369 --> 00:00:41.009
that many catch-wa-speakers also understand Spanish. It's the language commonly used

00:00:41.009 --> 00:00:46.570
in business and taught in school. However, it was noted that although they understood

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:54.240
the words we were teaching, the Bible's message didn't easily reach the heart. The good

00:00:54.240 --> 00:01:00.399
news still had to be preached, not only in every nation, but to all tribes and peoples

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:07.519
and tongues. In 1992, the branch office in Peru received permission to translate literature

00:01:07.519 --> 00:01:14.480
into catch-wa and start up preaching initiative to test the response in the field. When catch-wa-speakers

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:21.079
were approached with a warm greeting and presentation in their own language, it made a remarkable difference.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:35.000
People started responding favorably to the message and many Bible studies were started.

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:57.640
Gradually, translators realized that it was necessary to translate into other catch-wa languages.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.439
Just as there are a variety of cultures within Peru, there are also a variety of catch-wa

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:08.039
languages spoken. Translation teams were established where three of these languages are spoken,

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:20.310
an ayakucho, kusko, and watas. In 2013, permission was granted to build two new remote translation

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:27.669
offices, one in kusko and another in ayakucho. Many local and international brothers volunteered

00:02:27.669 --> 00:02:34.069
to help on the building projects. Whether rain or shine, they worked together with the joyful

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:56.069
spirit. By early 2016, the new offices were ready to operate. On May 1st, 2016, brother Jeffrey

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:01.669
Jackson of the governing body delivered the dedication talk of these new facilities to a delighted

00:03:01.669 --> 00:03:09.750
audience from around the country. We promise to use these buildings exclusively for

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:16.949
Jehovah's praise and glory. Do you accept that resolution?

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:36.620
These facilities are like gifts from Jehovah. Not only are the new offices clean and beautiful,

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.219
but they're specifically designed for the translation work.

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:48.060
One of the most important features of the new office is, therefore, is the audio recording studio,

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:54.460
equipped with a special soundproof room, where high-quality recordings are produced.

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:18.250
Children and older ones alike are captivated by videos of Juan Sito and Anita,

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:26.089
the catch-wa version of Caleb and Sofia. Just as when a tree grows and flourishes when

00:04:26.089 --> 00:04:32.410
provided with an ample supply of water, congregations have been growing and being fortified

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:40.730
by an increasing flow of spiritual food in their own language. This great in-gathering of the

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:46.970
catch-wa people to Jehovah's organization truly contributes to the fulfillment of the

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:54.089
Prophecy at Revelation 7.9. Look, a great crowd out of all nations and tribes and peoples

00:04:54.089 --> 00:05:02.329
and tongues standing before the throne and before the Lamb.
