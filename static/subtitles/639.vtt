00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:10.710
So, what does it take to help someone become firmly grounded in the truth?

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.710
Let's focus on three things.

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:22.710
Cooperating with divine direction, loving the truth, and loving people who love the truth.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:29.710
Let's go back to the year 50CE and see what we can learn from Paul's ministry in Macedonia.

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.710
Now, Paul began his second missionary tour around 49CE.

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.710
In Listera, he and Silas found Timothy, who Paul met, on his first visit.

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.710
But now, Timothy is ready to accompany them on their journey.

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:54.710
From map B13 in your study Bible, you can see that they visited Iconium and Pasidian Antioch.

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:02.710
But then you see the big purple swoop, purple representing Paul's second journey.

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:09.709
The map indicates no stops between Antioch and Troas, just a swoop.

00:01:09.709 --> 00:01:11.709
What does it represent?

00:01:11.709 --> 00:01:14.709
Obedience to divine direction.

00:01:14.709 --> 00:01:23.709
Acts 16-8 through 10 tells us that they tried to preach in Asia, but were forbidden by Holy Spirit.

00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:30.709
Then they tried to preach in Bethinia, but again Jesus used the Holy Spirit to block them.

00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:34.709
So they turned west and went all the way to Troas on the coast.

00:01:34.709 --> 00:01:43.709
This is where they met up with Luke, and it's in Troas that they received divine direction to step over into Macedonia.

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:49.709
They wasted no time, they stepped onto a ship, and they sailed over to Macedonia.

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:53.709
It's now spring or early summer, 50 CE.

00:01:53.709 --> 00:02:02.709
Within a year, Paul formed congregations in Philippi, Thessalonica, and Berea, cities of Macedonia.

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:05.709
But how did he do it?

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:16.020
It's turned to Acts chapter 17, and here we see Paul's love for the truth, shine through Acts chapter 17.

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.020
I begin in verse 1.

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:29.710
They now traveled through Ampifilus, and Apollonia, and came to Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue of the Jews.

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:45.710
So according to Paul's custom, he went inside to them, and for three Sabbaths, he reasoned with them from the Scriptures, explaining and proving by references that it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead.

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:47.710
Today's text.

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:52.710
Well, here we see Paul in the synagogue in Thessalonica.

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.710
He has their attention. Why?

00:02:54.710 --> 00:03:05.710
He's using God's inspired word. Paul loves these truths. You can see it in his eyes, and he's forming an attachment for these new disciples.

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:08.710
Is Jason in this picture?

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:18.710
Aristarchus, Demus, Secundus, all those believers came from Thessalonica, but there's a problem.

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:23.710
This was not Paul's synagogue, and the Jews were getting jealous.

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:28.710
At Acts chapter 17 and verse 5, they began persecuting the new believers.

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:30.710
Persecution.

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:44.710
Paul had been opposed in Philippi, and now here in Thessalonica as he would be in Berea as well, in short order he would be whisked away from Macedonia altogether.

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:55.710
So to stabilize those new congregations, Paul left Luke in Philippi, Silas, in Berea, and Timothy in Thessalonica.

00:03:55.710 --> 00:04:04.710
With trained representatives in each new congregation, could Paul now forget about Macedonia?

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:10.710
Well, turn with me please to 1 Thessalonians chapter 2 and verse 17.

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:14.710
This is where we see Paul's love for the brothers.

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:20.709
When Timothy came to Paul and Corinth and reported on the brothers in Thessalonica, it moved Paul to write,

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:32.709
what was very likely his first inspired letter, and in this letter he reveals where his heart was, 1 Thessalonians 2, 17.

00:04:32.709 --> 00:04:46.709
When we were separated, that's a powerful word, associated with parents bereaved of their children, indicating the strong bond Paul felt for his spiritual family.

00:04:46.709 --> 00:04:55.709
And we were separated from you, brothers, for just a short time, in person, not in our hearts.

00:04:55.709 --> 00:04:59.709
Yes, Paul's heart was still with the congregation in Thessalonica.

00:04:59.709 --> 00:05:05.709
In fact, he reveals, because of our strong desire, we made every effort to see you in person.

00:05:05.709 --> 00:05:13.709
For this reason, we wanted to come to you. Yes, I, Paul, tried, not just once but twice.

00:05:13.709 --> 00:05:19.709
But yet Satan cut across our path.

00:05:19.709 --> 00:05:24.709
Well, by this point, Paul had tried to go back twice, but his efforts were hindered.

00:05:24.709 --> 00:05:33.709
Would he mistake that as divine indication that his work in Macedonia was finished?

00:05:33.709 --> 00:05:41.709
No. Paul knew the difference between divine direction and satanic opposition.

00:05:41.709 --> 00:05:47.709
And he did not give up. Impaled by Jehovah's Spirit, Paul wrote this letter.

00:05:47.709 --> 00:05:54.709
And in his love for the congregation, and with his love for the truth, he reminds the Thessalonians of their hope.

00:05:54.709 --> 00:06:08.709
In verse 19, he mentions Christ's presence. In this one brief letter, he talks about Christ's presence more than he would in all 13 of his other inspired letters combined.

00:06:08.709 --> 00:06:15.709
Why? Because these persecuted Christians in Thessalonica needed to be reminded of their hope.

00:06:15.709 --> 00:06:20.709
They needed to wear it like a helmet and let it guard their thinking.

00:06:20.709 --> 00:06:27.709
And the encouragement worked. So, Satan used a different tactic.

00:06:27.709 --> 00:06:33.709
Speculators tried to twist, Paul's word. Why did he mention Christ's presence so much?

00:06:33.709 --> 00:06:44.709
Might this prove that the presence has already begun? Possibly there was even a letter wrongly attributed to Paul that was being interpreted to mean that the day of Jehovah had arrived.

00:06:44.709 --> 00:06:51.709
Well, what could Paul do about this? He wrote his second inspired letter.

00:06:51.709 --> 00:07:04.709
When it he had managed the brothers not to be quickly shaken from their reason, because Jehovah's Day would not come unless the apostasy comes first.

00:07:04.709 --> 00:07:15.709
The apostasy. Those words, completely harmonized with Jesus' illustration about the wheat and the weeds.

00:07:15.709 --> 00:07:26.709
The prophecy recorded in Matthew's Gospel, which had been in circulation for nearly 10 years when Paul wrote second Thessalonians.

00:07:26.709 --> 00:07:40.709
It's also in second Thessalonians that we learn that this apostasy would eventually set in because people did not accept the love of the truth.

00:07:40.709 --> 00:07:47.709
Meanwhile, though, Paul and the other apostles would act as a restraint against apostasy by fostering love for the truth.

00:07:47.709 --> 00:08:07.709
Yes, by Paul's example, in constantly meditating on the scriptures, reasoning from them, explaining them, and proving with references he equipped the brothers to withstand the opposition, they would face.

00:08:07.709 --> 00:08:14.709
As it turns out, Paul did return to Macedonia two more times, and what did he find?

00:08:14.709 --> 00:08:29.709
Strong congregations, exemplary in their love, unselfish in their generosity, giving even beyond their actual ability, their example, inspires Christians to this very day.

00:08:30.709 --> 00:08:56.710
So what does it take to help others become well-grounded in the truth, persistence in obeying divine direction, helping others to love the truth as we do, and loving those who love the truth, even when we're separated by circumstances remaining attached at heart?

00:08:56.710 --> 00:09:05.710
May we continue to follow this example of genuine love as we carry out our sacred service today.
