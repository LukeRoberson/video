00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:18.920
Colors fade on man-made materials, for example paint and clothing, yet for many species

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.089
of birds this isn't the case.

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:28.699
Their feathers remain permanently bright and vivid.

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:31.820
What's their secret?

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:37.579
Researchers examining the feathers of the Eurasian J discovered their colors are generated

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:43.460
primarily by small changes in feather structure, as opposed to pigment.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:50.219
Surface variations scatter the reflected light, which produces the hues we see.

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:56.020
And since this structure doesn't change with age, the colors never fade.

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:02.359
This discovery opens a whole new world of possibilities.

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:08.480
Dr. Andrew Parnell states, if nature can assemble this material on the wing, then we should

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.840
be able to do it synthetically.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.760
Researchers are now working to produce materials that mimic this.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.760
This could lead to paints that never fade, and perhaps even fabrics that look new and

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.359
vibrant, wash after wash.

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:26.079
What do you think?

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:30.920
Did the unfading color of bird feathers come about by evolution?

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.040
Or was it designed?
