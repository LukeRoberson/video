00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:09.509
Our Texas morning is taken from the article why we keep bearing much fruit.

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:19.149
And the article offered four major reasons why you and I preach today.

00:00:19.149 --> 00:00:27.730
The first reason given was to glorify Jehovah and to sanctify His name before mankind.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:36.409
The second reason given was to show our heart-thought-love for Jehovah and for Jesus.

00:00:36.409 --> 00:00:43.689
And the third reason given was we preach to give a warning.

00:00:43.689 --> 00:00:49.490
And it was none of those three that I was going to emphasize in my discussion today.

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:53.329
I wanted to talk about the fourth reason.

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:59.210
We preach because we love our neighbor.

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.170
We love our neighbor.

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:09.969
To watch our study article made a very powerful point that shows what's involved in showing

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:16.489
our love for our neighbor this way, here's what it stated.

00:01:16.489 --> 00:01:24.810
We are moved by such love to endure in this work, recognizing that people may have a change

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.650
of heart when their circumstances change.

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.209
Now what does this thought register in us?

00:01:34.209 --> 00:01:39.090
It helps us to see why we should always be positive and enthusiastic when it comes

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.930
to sharing in the preaching work.

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:49.530
We don't know what the person to whom we are going to speak is thinking at that particular

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.810
visit.

00:01:51.810 --> 00:02:00.049
The study article used an example of a jailer at the time that Paul and Silas were

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:06.890
arrested in Philippi, what happened while they were there in jail, there was an earthquake.

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:13.810
And things shook, and the jailer thought that all the prisoners had been shaken out

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.289
of their shackles and they were able to get out of there.

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:27.289
And so the account in Acts chapter 16 verse 26 says this.

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:36.719
The jailer feared that the prisoners had fled and was about to kill himself.

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:47.289
But Paul called out, do not hurt yourself, the distressed jailer asked, what must I do

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:50.409
to get saved?

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:55.810
And Paul inside this toll and believe in the Lord Jesus and you will get saved.

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.960
Now we learned something from this.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:06.439
Sometimes we can meet people and because of their current circumstance, we don't get

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:08.680
a listening ear.

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:11.280
Look what happened to this jailer.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:17.479
He was making sure everybody was soundly bound in the jail.

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:24.120
But then when his earthquake came, he had a change of thought because of this change of

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.159
circumstance.

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:30.439
So what should we learn from this?

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:35.000
That can happen when it comes to our preaching activity too.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:41.280
And that's why in our midweek meeting, we have all of these demonstrations of how we

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:47.439
can go about in our preaching work to try to touch the hearts of people.

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:55.080
Now some individuals today have not responded to the Bible's message before when we call

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.560
them on them.

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:02.439
But they may have a change of heart and look for help when their world is suddenly shaken

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:03.439
like this.

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:09.400
Jailers were always shaken when that earthquake took place.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:15.840
So we never know when something like this is happening in a life of people.

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:21.920
And that's why when we go, we should always have that positive state of mind.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:27.639
I'm reminded of an experience I heard some time ago.

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:32.199
This sister had been to a house in her territory a number of times.

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:40.079
And every time she returned, this woman at the house was very rude.

00:04:40.079 --> 00:04:47.199
But this day, she knocked on the woman's door and the same woman answered.

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:54.040
And here's what the woman said to our sister, I've been waiting for you to return.

00:04:54.040 --> 00:05:02.160
She was shocked to hear this woman who'd always been so rude, make such an expression.

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.959
And here's what she said.

00:05:03.959 --> 00:05:09.800
The woman said, I had a relative in another part of the country call me.

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:15.920
And that relative told me that if I would invite you in, when you came, you would take

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:23.279
my Bible and show me in my own Bible that hell is not a place of fire and torment.

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:27.819
I want you to show me that.

00:05:27.819 --> 00:05:35.459
And it resulted not only in showing but a productive Bible study for this woman.

00:05:35.459 --> 00:05:44.420
Now what else could change a person's whole attitude toward us in our preaching work?

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:51.740
One could have been diagnosed with a very serious illness or they may be heartbroken over

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:58.339
losing a loved relative or family member in death.

00:05:58.339 --> 00:06:05.459
When such events take place, some distressed individuals may ask us questions about the

00:06:05.459 --> 00:06:07.740
meaning of life.

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:12.180
And at one time those were questions they ignored.

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:19.379
We might call it their door or even be working on a job with them when they have this negative

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:25.779
experience in their life, like an earthquake, that the jailer experience.

00:06:25.779 --> 00:06:32.579
But it's our love for people that moves us to take advantage of the opportunities that

00:06:32.579 --> 00:06:40.699
we have to help people when they're in that proper mode in attitude for receiving the

00:06:40.699 --> 00:06:43.660
message.

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:49.779
This particular article that we're studying today mentioned a pioneer brother.

00:06:49.779 --> 00:06:52.980
He had been a pioneer for some 34 years.

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:58.579
And here's what the article quoted him as saying, capturing this point that we're making

00:06:58.579 --> 00:07:00.899
here this morning.

00:07:00.899 --> 00:07:09.740
He said, today, more than ever, many people feel emotionally low.

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:13.660
So our objective is to keep preaching.

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:16.500
Jehovah brings forth the fruitage.

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:22.139
We are his and the angels, fellow workers.

00:07:22.139 --> 00:07:26.899
I put a little emphasis on that point because we should always think of that.

00:07:26.899 --> 00:07:30.620
We're not ever in the service by ourselves.

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:32.819
Jehovah is interested in those people.

00:07:32.819 --> 00:07:35.459
The angels are interested in those people.

00:07:35.459 --> 00:07:41.459
And they know things about those people that we don't know because they're invisible

00:07:41.459 --> 00:07:47.579
presence and their personal interests in mankind.

00:07:47.579 --> 00:07:54.740
And so as Elvar said, Jehovah brings forth the fruitage.

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:59.259
We are his and the angels, fellow workers.

00:07:59.259 --> 00:08:05.180
Another pioneer, been pioneering 34 years, Robert, was quoted as saying, to work along

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:12.500
with angels who know what is going on in the householder's lives is exciting.

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:19.660
Have you ever thought of that as you go forth into the preaching work that you have angelic

00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:25.420
company and those angels know what's going on?

00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:32.059
Back in 2008, we had an awake article and the article was entitled, can the problem

00:08:32.059 --> 00:08:35.940
of crime be solved?

00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:41.059
That was February 2008.

00:08:41.059 --> 00:08:51.620
And the writer of the article, Criminal Mind, was written by a doctor Stantonese, same

00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:55.259
now.

00:08:55.259 --> 00:09:01.779
And in the article, it told us to consider the example of a woman who had been molested

00:09:01.779 --> 00:09:04.220
as a child.

00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:10.059
She took up drugs, she abused alcohol, used tobacco.

00:09:10.059 --> 00:09:20.259
And at the time that the article was written, she was serving a life sentence in prison.

00:09:20.259 --> 00:09:24.179
But while in prison, she began to study with us.

00:09:24.179 --> 00:09:30.539
See that prison circumstance changed her vantage point and her viewpoint.

00:09:30.539 --> 00:09:39.139
And anyhow, she studied with us and she took the heart which she was learning.

00:09:39.139 --> 00:09:46.860
And the article says, now she's no longer a slave to destructive thinking and vices.

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:56.659
One of her favorite Bible texts is 2 Corinthians 3, 17, which states, now Jehovah is the Spirit.

00:09:56.659 --> 00:10:03.299
And where the Spirit of Jehovah is, there is freedom.

00:10:03.299 --> 00:10:06.779
So we love the people out there.

00:10:06.779 --> 00:10:10.700
That's why we don't give up in our efforts to help them.

00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:16.299
That's why we keep getting in our midweek meeting, this encouragement to keep preaching

00:10:16.299 --> 00:10:26.799
and to have a positive attitude because we don't know who or what kind of individual

00:10:26.799 --> 00:10:31.240
we're going to be talking to at each door.

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:34.639
And so we should always have that positive attitude.
