WEBVTT

00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:05.960
I'd like to talk about the translation of our publications, and there's a particular

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:10.039
aspect of translation I'd like to comment on.

00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:14.000
Now I know that quite a number of you have moved to a country where your mother tongue

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.719
isn't spoken, either defined work, or to serve or the need is greater, and others are

00:00:19.719 --> 00:00:26.079
serving right at home, but in foreign language congregations.

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:30.519
At times you may have compared an article in your mother tongue with the same article

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:35.880
in your second language, and found differences in the translation, and you might wonder

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:36.880
why that is.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:42.920
Oh, we'd never conclude that the translators had been unfaithful, or careless, or that

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.479
they were running ahead of the organization.

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:49.479
No, we trust our hardworking brothers and sisters.

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:54.679
So we know there must be good reasons for the differences, and the purpose of this brief

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:59.039
discussion is to suggest what some of those reasons might be.

00:00:59.119 --> 00:01:04.079
First, a word about one of the principles our translators follow.

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:09.760
They're expected not only to render the thought in the English text accurately, but also

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.719
to keep in mind the way people speak.

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:19.719
So accuracy, clarity, and naturalness are needed while maintaining the dignity of our

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:21.680
message.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:28.799
Now what's involved in preparing a translation does both accurate and natural.

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.359
It's not as if the translators are like the Jewish scribes who made copies of the Hebrew

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:34.760
scriptures.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:39.920
To make sure that the copies they made were accurate in every detail, they would count

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:46.640
not only every word, but also every letter they copied from the source text.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.400
Translation's not like that.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.599
It's not as if there must be seven words in the target language if there are seven words

00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:54.599
in the English.

00:01:54.599 --> 00:01:59.439
Every word in the English may not be translated, but the complete thought of the English has

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:01.879
to be there.

00:02:01.879 --> 00:02:05.799
English makes effective use of repetition.

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:07.799
What do we mean by that?

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:13.599
Well, you can write one sentence in English, then repeat the same thought in slightly different

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:16.840
words in the next sentence, and it sounds fine.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.639
But in some languages, to repeat a thought would be viewed as poor writing, and that wouldn't

00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:24.759
reflect well on our publications.

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:32.439
So in such cases, the translators are allowed to combine the two sentences into just one sentence

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:35.960
as long as the thought is completely conveyed.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:41.599
Or they might make two sentences out of one long English sentence if that's more natural

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:43.120
in the language.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:48.939
So you can't always compare the length of an English paragraph with the length of the

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:56.419
paragraph in the target language and say, hey, this paragraph is shorter than that paragraph.

00:02:56.419 --> 00:03:01.180
Sometimes we hear brothers who have learned a second language say, I don't see why the translators

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.099
didn't follow the English word for word.

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:07.460
After all, you can say that in the language.

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:13.460
Well, you may have the words, yet may be possible to say that.

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:18.539
But what a literal translation sounds strange to native speakers.

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:23.819
No matter how well a foreigner has learned a language, native speakers who speak the

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:29.340
language well are usually the best judges of what is natural.

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.659
Modesty will help foreign speakers to recognize that.

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:38.860
There's another thing that foreign speakers need to be aware of.

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:43.460
If they're vocal in their criticism of a certain translation, how would that affect

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:48.580
the confidence of native speakers who have to rely on the translation for their spiritual

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:49.580
food?

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:56.780
Of course, nobody's perfect, and as long as translation is done by imperfect people,

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:58.659
it won't be perfect.

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:05.500
But rest assured that our translators take their work very seriously.

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.539
The subject of translation is complex, and I'm sure no expert.

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:14.300
Let's hear from some brothers who have worked in the field for many years and see what

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:15.819
we can learn.

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:24.720
Meet Nick Alaris, Nick XRKS, and Sake Moray.

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:32.639
As we have just heard, the goal of translators is to convey ideas accurately, naturally,

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:33.639
and clearly.

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:36.839
This isn't an easy thing to do.

00:04:36.839 --> 00:04:40.600
Let's discuss a few of the challenges of translation.

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:47.959
We will focus on three areas and see why translators make the choices they do.

00:04:47.959 --> 00:04:53.959
Bible expressions, illustrations, and vocabulary.

00:04:53.959 --> 00:04:57.759
So our first point is Bible expressions.

00:04:57.759 --> 00:05:04.920
Nick, could you please tell us why translating some expressions in the Bible can be very

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:05.920
challenging?

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:12.319
Well, before our brothers and sisters receive the New World Translation in their language,

00:05:12.319 --> 00:05:16.279
they have to use Bibles produced by Christendom.

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:23.360
Often these Bibles contain false religious ideas and terms that reflect those ideas.

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:29.000
So when we produce the New World Translation, great care has to be taken not to allow such

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.920
terms to distort our translation.

00:05:32.399 --> 00:05:40.000
Can you give us an example of an expression that was translated the wrong way in the Bibles

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.439
produced by Christendom?

00:05:41.439 --> 00:05:45.800
Well, one example is the term Holy Spirit.

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:52.600
In many Bibles produced by Christendom, the term gives the idea of a spirit creature

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:58.920
in heaven, even a Holy Ghost, sometimes even a Holy Demon.

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:02.560
That must be very confusing to the readers.

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.519
But what can the translators do about that?

00:06:05.519 --> 00:06:09.959
In many languages, our translators have found that the closest way to translate Holy Spirit

00:06:09.959 --> 00:06:13.959
is to say Holy Power or Holy Force.

00:06:13.959 --> 00:06:18.680
This may sound very different, but it conveys the same idea.

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:23.100
And even the English New World Translation describes the term Holy Spirit as God's

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:29.180
active force, at Genesis 1-2, while other English translations say God's Holy Spirit.

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:30.180
Good.

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:38.019
So now the brothers can use an expression that is understood by the field and the audience.

00:06:38.019 --> 00:06:41.139
But it must be a wonderful thing to have the New World Translation.

00:06:41.139 --> 00:06:43.899
Yes, it's a wonderful thing.

00:06:43.899 --> 00:06:48.019
But still, the brothers have to get used to the new terms.

00:06:48.019 --> 00:06:53.740
Remember that they've been using the original terms in their local Bibles for years to

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:59.459
teach people the truth, but as they get used to the new terminology and their personal

00:06:59.459 --> 00:07:05.620
study at meetings and in the ministry, they begin to see the benefits of the new terms

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:09.500
and afterward they really embrace the New World Translation.

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:10.500
Thank you.

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:15.060
Now, let us go to the second challenge, illustrations.

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:19.779
Why are illustrations particularly difficult to translate?

00:07:19.779 --> 00:07:24.459
An illustration that works in one culture might not work in another.

00:07:24.459 --> 00:07:27.980
Illustrations are only effective if the reader can relate to them.

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:31.660
And that's why Jesus used illustrations based on everyday things that his audience

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:36.180
was familiar with, such as farming, building, fishing.

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:40.459
And today our publications use illustrations that people can relate to.

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:46.379
I remember an article I discussed the need for us to be patient in difficult situations.

00:07:46.379 --> 00:07:50.100
And it used the illustration of a driver who is stuck in traffic.

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:54.379
Now, one translation team wrote to the translator help desk and they explained that most of

00:07:54.379 --> 00:07:57.500
the readers were not familiar with traffic jams.

00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:01.500
For someone who lives in a big city, that sounds unbelievable, but it's true.

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:04.300
So the team wanted to use a different illustration.

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:09.339
They are familiar with the idea of people standing in long lines waiting for their maze

00:08:09.339 --> 00:08:12.459
or corn to be ground at the milling machine.

00:08:12.459 --> 00:08:16.819
And this illustration was approved because it would help the readers get the point

00:08:16.819 --> 00:08:18.740
they need to be patient.

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:24.339
Now, these are completely different illustrations, but the point or the message is the same.

00:08:24.339 --> 00:08:27.180
For example, then about being patient.

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:33.019
Now, when we read in our language edition of the Watchtower or other publication,

00:08:33.019 --> 00:08:36.820
a different illustration than the one we read in English,

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:41.860
we can be confident that the translators received approval to make this adjustment

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:44.100
so that the right messages conveyed.

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:45.539
Well, that was very helpful.

00:08:45.539 --> 00:08:46.659
Thank you.

00:08:46.659 --> 00:08:50.700
Now, let us go to our third challenge, that of vocabulary.

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:54.779
That is the words that are used in a language.

00:08:54.779 --> 00:09:00.139
Now, we might assume that for every important word in our language,

00:09:00.139 --> 00:09:04.179
that they will be an exact equivalent in another language.

00:09:04.179 --> 00:09:07.980
Well, translation is much more complicated than that.

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:10.700
Take, for example, the word piece.

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:15.860
Some years back, we had a convention about godly peace.

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:19.539
And one might think, well, that's an easy word to translate.

00:09:19.539 --> 00:09:25.019
But that word was used about 350 times in talks on the convention,

00:09:25.019 --> 00:09:28.620
sometimes referring to peace between God and man,

00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:33.139
sometimes referring to peace in family or with our neighbors,

00:09:33.139 --> 00:09:36.139
and other times referring to peace of mind.

00:09:36.139 --> 00:09:39.700
Now, in some language, there's simply no way to use one word

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:42.740
to convey all those aspects of peace,

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:46.980
because they have one word for the kind of peace that God gives,

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:51.740
a different word when there's no war in a country, that kind of peace,

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:56.340
and a different word to indicate that people are getting along with one another.

00:09:56.340 --> 00:10:02.539
So those translators need to understand the point of each usage in the context

00:10:02.539 --> 00:10:06.179
and then convey the right translation accordingly.

00:10:06.179 --> 00:10:09.580
Now, it opens our mind to how wonderfully Jehovah made us,

00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:14.899
with the capacity to think and feel and have many concepts and ideas,

00:10:14.899 --> 00:10:19.860
and to have the ability to express it in our language,

00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:22.299
in other words, use words for that.

00:10:22.299 --> 00:10:25.340
But we express them in so many different ways.

00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:26.899
Yes, this is so true.

00:10:26.899 --> 00:10:30.460
Every language has its own vocabulary and way of expressing things.

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:34.100
What I find very interesting is how other languages render

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:36.980
standard expressions that we use as Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:41.299
for example, field service, circuit overseer, kingdom hold,

00:10:41.299 --> 00:10:42.779
special pioneer.

00:10:42.779 --> 00:10:45.460
Those expressions were first used in English,

00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:48.820
and then translators had to come up with equivalents in their languages

00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:50.059
so that it would make sense.

00:10:50.059 --> 00:10:52.700
But that wouldn't be difficult, would it be?

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:57.340
Because for the word kingdom, surely we have another word and another language,

00:10:57.340 --> 00:11:00.500
and for the word hall, we have an equivalent word,

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:04.980
and all you have to do is put the two words together to translate kingdom all.

00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:09.019
They may have the words, but a literal translation of kingdom hold

00:11:09.019 --> 00:11:11.379
could mean something totally different.

00:11:11.379 --> 00:11:13.620
Now, some countries still have a king.

00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:18.220
In those places, this kingdom hold could mean government office,

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:22.460
or it could mean hall belonging to the kingdom of Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:24.460
so that would be totally misleading.

00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:28.299
And that's why the governing body has given approval to say

00:11:28.299 --> 00:11:31.019
the meeting place of Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:11:31.019 --> 00:11:33.779
or the hall of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:11:33.779 --> 00:11:37.139
Even though the expressions sound a little bit different,

00:11:37.139 --> 00:11:41.340
the basic intent is the same, and people get the right idea.

00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:46.539
So it is obvious that the challenges of translation are huge.

00:11:46.539 --> 00:11:51.019
But now the question, how can a newly formed translation team,

00:11:51.019 --> 00:11:54.419
or one in a very remote location,

00:11:54.419 --> 00:12:01.419
have the confidence and have the assurance that they produce the highest standard possible?

00:12:01.419 --> 00:12:05.779
Well, all translation teams, regardless of size or location,

00:12:05.779 --> 00:12:09.899
benefit from regular communication with the writing committee of the governing body.

00:12:09.899 --> 00:12:15.379
Well, we understand that the governing body directs matters from headquarters.

00:12:15.379 --> 00:12:19.259
But do they really know what the translators are doing?

00:12:19.259 --> 00:12:22.259
Well, the writing committee trusts the translators.

00:12:22.259 --> 00:12:26.580
But at the same time, they don't try to micromanage their work.

00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:30.179
What they have done is set in place training programs

00:12:30.179 --> 00:12:34.100
to teach translators basic translation principles

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:37.659
to help them to understand how to apply those principles

00:12:37.659 --> 00:12:40.019
when translating the publications.

00:12:40.019 --> 00:12:46.259
And this ensures that the same message is being conveyed regardless of language.

00:12:46.259 --> 00:12:52.860
And when they're not sure that their solution is exactly right on target,

00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:57.340
they can write to the writing committee and ask for direction to inquire

00:12:57.340 --> 00:13:01.860
whether this solution conveys the right idea and the context.

00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:06.740
Also, the writing committee answers hundreds of translation questions every week

00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:09.340
as part of the ongoing training of the teams.

00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:11.539
All of the translators have access to these answers

00:13:11.539 --> 00:13:13.620
so that they can learn from one another

00:13:13.659 --> 00:13:17.139
on how to solve problems which are delicate and difficult.

00:13:17.139 --> 00:13:20.379
And this effective communication system really helps

00:13:20.379 --> 00:13:23.419
to unify the thinking of all the translators

00:13:23.419 --> 00:13:26.220
and make sure that they all produce the same message.

00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:30.100
And that unifies the thinking of the worldwide field.

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:36.179
Well, thank you very much for explaining those factors affecting translation.

00:13:36.179 --> 00:13:40.940
And it is impressive that Jehovah has an arrangement in place

00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:45.539
that reverses the effect of Bable.

00:13:45.539 --> 00:13:50.740
And it is also so wonderful that by means of his Holy Spirit,

00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:54.620
Jehovah unifies his people around the earth

00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:58.379
regardless of what language they use.

00:13:58.379 --> 00:13:59.940
Thanks, brothers.

00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:03.460
You've given us an even deeper appreciation for all the work involved

00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:06.299
in making a quality translation.

00:14:06.299 --> 00:14:09.299
I learned a lot, and I'm sure our audience did, too.
