00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:05.780
The theme of our broadcast is a very comforting one.

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:10.779
Being securely wrapped in the bag of life with Jehovah.

00:00:10.779 --> 00:00:16.780
Perhaps the thought of being securely wrapped makes us think of a safely swaddled baby

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:20.780
or being enveloped in the warm blanket on a cold night.

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:26.780
In the Bible, these words were uttered by the woman Abigail to Jehovah's servant David.

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:30.780
To understand the meaning of the words and their importance today,

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:34.780
let's review the context the first Samuel chapter 25.

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.780
David and 600 of his men were dwelling as fugitives.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.780
They eventually encountered men who worked as shepherds for Abigail's husband, Navel.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:51.780
David and his men began to help guard Navel's flocks and serve as a protective wall for Navel's flocks and servants

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.780
against thieves and invaders who roamed through the wilderness.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.780
It was likely challenging to find enough food for 600 soldiers.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.780
So David decided to send 10 of his men to kindly ask Navel for food

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.780
in repayment for the services that they had performed.

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.780
But at first Samuel, chapter 25, verse 10,

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.780
and 11, note Navel's reply.

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.780
Navel answered David's servants,

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.780
who is David?

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.780
And who is the son of Jesse?

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.780
Nowadays, many servants are breaking away from their masters.

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.780
Do I have to take my bread and my water and the meat that I butchered from my shears

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.780
and give it to men who come from who knows where?

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.780
This was not the response that David and his men were expecting to hear.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.780
The Bible describes Navel as a very harsh, worthless man,

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.780
and this is certainly evidence by his reply.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.780
He screamed insults at the messengers and ridiculed David,

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.780
comparing him to a runaway servant.

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.780
So David decided to take matters into his own hands

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:11.780
and resolve the situation the way many people today might by fighting.

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.780
In verse 13, he has 400 of his men prepared themselves for battle

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:22.780
with one mission to wipe out every male in Navel's household.

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.780
Eventually, we're getting back to Abigail about what her husband had done.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.780
Without telling Navel, she gathered an abundance of food and went out to meet David.

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.780
When she met up with him, she poured out her hearted length,

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.780
asking David to forgive her personally and making a powerful plea for mercy

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.780
on behalf of her husband and her household.

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.780
She acknowledged that Navel was a foolish and senseless man.

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.780
So she urged David not to take any action that might bring blood guilt upon him

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.780
or cause him to be affected by a troubled conscience.

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:04.780
As Abigail concluded her appeal to David, notice what she tells him in verse 29,

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.780
the theme of our discussion.

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.780
When someone rises up to pursue you and seeks your life,

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:18.780
the life of my Lord will be wrapped securely in the bag of life with Jehovah your God.

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.780
But the lives of your enemies, he will hurl away like stones from a slink

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:30.090
just as we might wrap up something valuable in order to protect and preserve it.

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:35.090
Abigail was telling David that is how his life would be in Jehovah's hands.

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.090
Jehovah would protect and preserve David's life from his enemies

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.090
as long as he did not seek to save himself by personal efforts.

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:51.090
But waited on Jehovah, trusting in the one to whom he owed his life.

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.090
What lessons can we learn from this account?

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:00.090
As David saw, his relationship with Jehovah was a protection.

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:05.090
In verse 32, he acknowledges that God had sent Abigail with the warning.

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:13.090
We learn that Jehovah's spiritual protection for us is related to the quality of our relationship with him.

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:19.089
That's why the Bible tells us at James chapter 4, verse 8,

00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:25.089
draw close to God and he will draw close to you.

00:04:25.089 --> 00:04:33.089
Jehovah invites us to draw near to him because he wants to receive us into his favor as his friends.

00:04:33.089 --> 00:04:37.089
When we dedicate our lives and vow to serve him unconditionally,

00:04:37.089 --> 00:04:43.089
we gain an approved standing with him where figuratively put in that bag of life.

00:04:43.089 --> 00:04:47.089
And as we work to develop a close personal relationship with him,

00:04:47.089 --> 00:04:51.089
then we can experience Jehovah's friendship and protection.

00:04:51.089 --> 00:04:59.089
We would never want to restrict Jehovah's protection by not looking to him for guidance or relying on our own thinking.

00:04:59.089 --> 00:05:06.089
Now, can we think of areas or situations that might require us to wait on Jehovah?

00:05:06.089 --> 00:05:11.089
Perhaps we're experiencing literal opposition at work or at school.

00:05:11.089 --> 00:05:16.089
Like Abigail, he might face the challenge of living with a difficult marriage made.

00:05:17.089 --> 00:05:23.089
Maybe we're battling a health issue and loyalty is needed regarding our medical choices.

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:30.089
Or it may be that we live in a country where we cannot preach freely or we face opposition for our beliefs.

00:05:30.089 --> 00:05:37.089
Really, it could be any number of situations, but it is our response,

00:05:37.089 --> 00:05:44.089
the way we handle the situation, that indicates how much we are allowing Jehovah to help us.

00:05:44.089 --> 00:05:53.089
Do we trust him enough that we can leave the matter in his hands and see how he works things out in our behalf?

00:05:53.089 --> 00:05:58.089
We have to manifest Christian qualities in order to do that.

00:05:58.089 --> 00:06:03.089
Think about what qualities displayed by Abigail and David impress you most.

00:06:03.089 --> 00:06:08.089
To that come to mind, our patience and reasonableness.

00:06:08.089 --> 00:06:18.089
Patience is closely connected with endurance and enables one to put up with difficult circumstances while maintaining a positive attitude.

00:06:18.089 --> 00:06:25.089
Reasonableness describes a person who is fair, considerate, willing to yield to others.

00:06:25.089 --> 00:06:28.089
How well this describes Abigail.

00:06:28.089 --> 00:06:32.089
It must have been quite a challenge to live with someone like Nebel.

00:06:32.089 --> 00:06:38.089
But nowhere do we read that she was ever disrespectful of him or that she belittled him.

00:06:38.089 --> 00:06:42.089
Even when she referred to him as senseless in verse 25,

00:06:42.089 --> 00:06:51.089
from Jehovah's standpoint, her comments were proper because Nebel's actions put his entire household in danger.

00:06:51.089 --> 00:06:53.089
How about David?

00:06:53.089 --> 00:07:00.089
He was in a position of authority, but he showed great patience and reasonableness in listening to Abigail

00:07:00.089 --> 00:07:03.089
and having the good sense to know that she was right.

00:07:03.089 --> 00:07:09.089
That's not always easy to do when the heat of the moment or when we're upset.

00:07:09.089 --> 00:07:14.089
Perhaps you recall that our don't give up regional convention last year.

00:07:14.089 --> 00:07:18.089
When discussing 2nd Peter chapter 1 verses 5 through 8,

00:07:18.089 --> 00:07:24.089
we learned a nice formula that can help us to cultivate and strengthen Christian qualities.

00:07:24.089 --> 00:07:29.089
We were encouraged to study them, meditate on them,

00:07:30.089 --> 00:07:32.089
and put them into practice.

00:07:32.089 --> 00:07:37.089
If we apply this formula with the qualities of patience and reasonableness,

00:07:37.089 --> 00:07:41.089
it can help us to endure our trials successfully.

00:07:41.089 --> 00:07:46.089
And we're confident that Jehovah will supply us with whatever power we need

00:07:46.089 --> 00:07:53.089
so that we will not tire out as we continue to endure and put our trust in him.

00:07:53.089 --> 00:07:59.089
In addition to developing these qualities, something else that can help us is our spiritual routine.

00:07:59.089 --> 00:08:06.089
Our consistent routine of study, meeting attendance, and the ministry will help us remain busy.

00:08:06.089 --> 00:08:11.089
Stay active and make good decisions.

00:08:11.089 --> 00:08:17.089
We'll have no time to become curious or occupy with the things this world has to offer.

00:08:17.089 --> 00:08:21.089
It's good to remember the people during the days of Haggai.

00:08:22.089 --> 00:08:27.089
When the Jews lost their focus and started neglecting Jehovah's temple,

00:08:27.089 --> 00:08:31.089
they lost his blessing and protection spiritually.

00:08:31.089 --> 00:08:34.090
And what was the result?

00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:39.090
Well, notice how Haggai draws our attention to a different type of bag,

00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:44.090
at Haggai chapter 1 verse 6.

00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:48.090
You have so much seed, but you harvest little.

00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:52.090
You eat, but it is not to satisfaction.

00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:56.090
You drink, but you do not drink your fill.

00:08:56.090 --> 00:09:00.090
You put on clothing, but no one gets warm.

00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:06.090
The one who hires himself out puts his wages in a bag full of holes.

00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:11.090
The Jews sowed seed, but had a meager harvest.

00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:14.090
They lacked enough food to satisfy their needs.

00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:18.090
They were unable to clothe themselves with warm garments.

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:21.090
Because Jehovah withheld his blessings,

00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:28.090
Haggai rightly compared them to a man who puts his wages in a bag full of holes.

00:09:28.090 --> 00:09:33.090
Imagine the disappointment of discovering that hard-earned wages

00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:37.090
had gradually disappeared through a leaking bag.

00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:41.090
Of course, our focus is not material prosperity,

00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:45.090
because whether we have an abundance of material things or not,

00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:49.090
if we fail to receive Jehovah's blessing,

00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:52.090
our spirituality is jeopardized.

00:09:52.090 --> 00:09:57.090
So we must be determined to never lose our focus

00:09:57.090 --> 00:10:01.090
and keep Jehovah in the forefront of our lives.

00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:04.090
When we examine the life of David,

00:10:04.090 --> 00:10:07.090
it's evident that he enjoyed a preserved

00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:10.090
and protected relationship with God.

00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:12.090
When we read the book of Psalms,

00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:17.090
take note of how David describes Jehovah's protective care.

00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:21.090
In Psalm 18, Psalm 31,

00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:24.090
and Psalm 34, as he went through distresses,

00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:27.090
just beautiful accounts.

00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:31.090
Now, did David always do everything the right way?

00:10:31.090 --> 00:10:35.090
No. Think of his encounter with Navel.

00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:38.090
While his angry reaction was understandable,

00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:42.090
his way of expressing it was not correct.

00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:45.090
But David learned from his mistakes,

00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:49.090
and each new trial that he went through strengthened his relationship

00:10:49.090 --> 00:10:52.090
with Jehovah even more.

00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:55.090
For example, after the ordeal with Navel,

00:10:55.090 --> 00:10:59.090
a short time later, David married Abigail.

00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:01.090
They were still fugitives,

00:11:01.090 --> 00:11:04.090
but he found a king that befriended them,

00:11:04.090 --> 00:11:07.090
and gave David's men and family a land to dwell in.

00:11:07.090 --> 00:11:10.090
One day, while all the men were away,

00:11:10.090 --> 00:11:13.090
the Amalakites raided and burned the city

00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:18.090
and carried off all the men's wives, children, and flocks.

00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:21.090
Upon returning and seeing what had happened,

00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:24.090
David and his men wept.

00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:26.090
Grief quickly turned to bitterness,

00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:30.090
and David's men spoke of stoning him.

00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:33.090
This was likely quite stressful for David.

00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:36.090
He was concerned for the safety of his family,

00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:40.090
and likely he was frustrated that his men had turned on him.

00:11:40.090 --> 00:11:45.090
Maybe he felt disrespected again as he had with Navel.

00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:49.090
So how would he handle this situation?

00:11:49.090 --> 00:11:56.090
We get a glimpse of David's feelings at 1 Samuel, chapter 30, verse 6.

00:11:56.090 --> 00:12:00.659
David was very distressed,

00:12:00.659 --> 00:12:02.659
because the men were talking of stoning him,

00:12:02.659 --> 00:12:05.659
for all the men had become very bitter

00:12:05.659 --> 00:12:08.659
over the loss of their sons and daughters.

00:12:08.659 --> 00:12:14.659
But notice, how did David handle the situation?

00:12:14.659 --> 00:12:17.659
The verse continues,

00:12:17.659 --> 00:12:22.659
but David strengthened himself by Jehovah his God.

00:12:22.659 --> 00:12:25.659
How did he do this?

00:12:25.659 --> 00:12:27.659
Verse 8 says,

00:12:27.659 --> 00:12:32.659
David inquired of Jehovah.

00:12:32.659 --> 00:12:37.659
This time, David has a different thought process and response.

00:12:37.659 --> 00:12:42.659
Immediately, he remembers to consult Jehovah.

00:12:42.659 --> 00:12:45.659
Isn't this a nice reminder that when you and I

00:12:45.659 --> 00:12:48.659
are going through difficult trials and situations,

00:12:48.659 --> 00:12:51.659
we want to immediately pray to Jehovah

00:12:51.659 --> 00:12:55.659
and seek his direction through the pages of his word, the Bible.

00:12:55.659 --> 00:13:01.659
This is essential for our spiritual protection.

00:13:01.659 --> 00:13:03.659
So in review,

00:13:03.659 --> 00:13:06.659
as we face difficult situations in life,

00:13:06.659 --> 00:13:09.659
may we look for opportunities to show and develop

00:13:09.659 --> 00:13:14.659
our Christian qualities, such as patience and reasonableness.

00:13:14.659 --> 00:13:18.659
These qualities show Jehovah that we want to be like him,

00:13:18.659 --> 00:13:20.659
that we have the mental disposition of Christ,

00:13:20.659 --> 00:13:25.659
and that we will allow him to guide us constantly.

00:13:25.659 --> 00:13:30.659
Next, may we keep focused and busy in the work of the Lord,

00:13:30.659 --> 00:13:33.659
by drawing close to Jehovah through prayer,

00:13:33.659 --> 00:13:35.659
and engaging in spiritual activities,

00:13:35.659 --> 00:13:39.659
we make the best of our situation now.

00:13:39.659 --> 00:13:41.659
But we will also find,

00:13:41.659 --> 00:13:44.659
everlasting protection in Jehovah's hands,

00:13:44.659 --> 00:13:46.659
safely swaddled,

00:13:46.659 --> 00:13:50.659
and securely wrapped in his bag of life.
