00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:08.369
My name is Yaroslav Dovanic.

00:00:08.369 --> 00:00:11.369
I received my degree from the biology department

00:00:11.369 --> 00:00:16.370
of the Ujgorod State University and specialized in zoology.

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:20.370
I love nature very much and want to protect it.

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:24.370
The evolutionary theory, in my opinion, quite reasonably argued

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:28.370
that there is no creator, that everything was shaped

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:32.369
by a series of random changes and combinations.

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.369
I was unable to prove this, but I believed it.

00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:39.369
And that is why I was an evolutionist.

00:00:39.369 --> 00:00:44.380
I was a staunch evolutionist.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.380
While working in the Carpathian biosphere reserve

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.380
and studying how ecological systems function,

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:55.380
I studied nature through the lens of the evolution theory.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.920
When I studied nature through this lens,

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.920
I began to notice things that contradicted the theory of evolution.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.920
I found things that couldn't have been formed by natural selection.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:16.629
As I started to wonder about this, whether there is a creator,

00:01:16.629 --> 00:01:21.629
I began to discover more facts contradicting the theory of evolution.

00:01:21.629 --> 00:01:26.629
Can anyone say that some computer programs appeared simply by chance?

00:01:26.629 --> 00:01:30.629
In contrast, evolutionists would like us to believe

00:01:30.629 --> 00:01:34.629
that DNA was formed by evolution to illustrate.

00:01:35.629 --> 00:01:38.629
Say you take some letter blocks,

00:01:38.629 --> 00:01:41.629
pour them onto the table,

00:01:41.629 --> 00:01:46.629
and the Encyclopedia Britannica is formed.

00:01:46.629 --> 00:01:53.629
There is an even smaller probability that DNA originated by evolution.

00:01:53.629 --> 00:01:56.629
When I started to seriously consider the possibility

00:01:56.629 --> 00:02:00.629
that the world might have been created,

00:02:00.629 --> 00:02:05.900
I began to meditate about the following.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.900
I knew that religion explains that the world was created by God.

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:14.900
So I decided to examine different religious teachings,

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:21.080
including what the Bible says, about how God created the world.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.080
The Bible is very old, thousands of years old,

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.080
and yet its contents are accurate and authentic to this day.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.080
And the Bible contains many prophecies.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:38.360
These are the foretelling of events.

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.740
They were to occur in the distant future,

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.740
sometimes many centuries in the future.

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:51.740
History confirms that they have been fulfilled exactly as the Bible foretold.

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:58.740
So these predictions must have been made by someone whose abilities are far greater than man's.

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:05.810
This proves that the author of the Bible is not man,

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.810
but someone who is far wiser and has abilities which man lacks.
