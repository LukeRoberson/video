00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:11.130
welcome dear brothers and sisters to our program. Today we'll consider how we can

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:19.129
use Bible principles to make good decisions. But first let's enjoy some encouraging

00:00:19.129 --> 00:00:26.969
updates. We're pleased to share news about two recent special conventions. On the weekend of

00:00:26.969 --> 00:00:36.609
May 23 through 25, 2025, a special convention was held in Santa Cruz, Bolivia. This was the

00:00:36.609 --> 00:00:45.450
largest theocratic event ever held in Bolivia. Over 1900 delegates came from some 10 countries.

00:00:45.450 --> 00:01:00.729
The peak attendance was 19,233 and 277 got baptized. Then on June 13 through 15, a special

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:11.170
convention was held in Tirana, Albania. The peak attendance was 8,987 including nearly 2,000

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:19.450
delegates from 17 countries. This was the largest convention of Jehovah's Witnesses ever held in

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:31.250
Albania and 83 were baptized. What a delight to see Jehovah's people sharing together in pure

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:43.969
worship. These occasions remind us of the words of Psalm 133 1. Look how good and how pleasant it is

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:54.769
for brothers to dwell together in unity. But now let's discuss how we as Christians can make wise

00:01:54.769 --> 00:02:05.010
decisions using Bible principles rather than relying on a list of rules. Consider this simple

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:15.250
illustration as children our parents gave us rules to keep us safe. They likely said always hold my

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:25.330
hand when crossing the street. Our parents made that rule to protect us from real danger. But as

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:36.050
we got older we no longer needed to hold mom or dad's hand. Did the danger go away? No. Instead we

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:44.770
learned to look at the traffic in front of us and cross the road safely. After all it would seem

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:52.610
odd if a healthy 30-year-old man still needed to hold his mother's hand to cross the street.

00:02:54.689 --> 00:03:03.090
Likewise, mature Christians don't need a rule for every situation. Instead we look at each

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:12.610
situation and consider Bible principles. If no Bible law is directly involved then we use our

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:21.810
Bible-train conscience to make a good decision. For example consider the use of symbols or customs

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:31.729
that may have roots in false religion. In our vast organization that spans 240 lands

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:38.129
can you imagine how many different symbols and customs our brothers encounter?

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:46.129
How can we make good decisions above the use of a certain symbol or custom?

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:57.090
Well here are three basic principles to consider. Number one, would Jehovah be offended by this?

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:09.250
At 2 Corinthians 6.17 Jehovah gives us clear direction. Therefore get out from among them and separate

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:18.370
yourself says Jehovah and quit touching the unclean thing and I will take you in. This principle

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:26.769
emphasizes that Christians must stay far away from any similar custom related to false religion

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:39.889
or spiritism. Number two, how would this affect others in the congregation? Romans 14, 19 and 21

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:48.370
remind us so then let us pursue the things making for peace and the things that build one another

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:56.610
up. It is best not to eat meat or drink wine or do anything over which your brother stumbles.

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:05.810
Even if a symbol or custom isn't wrong in itself we need to consider how others in the congregation

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:13.970
might view it. We would never want our actions to offend others needlessly.

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:22.370
At the same time as mature Christians we respect the right that others have to make their own

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:33.250
decisions based on their Bible-trained conscience. Number three, how is this symbol or custom viewed by

00:05:33.329 --> 00:05:44.689
people in my culture or community? The Bible principle? First Corinthians 9, 20, 21 and 23.

00:05:45.649 --> 00:05:53.730
To the Jews I became as a Jew in order to gain Jews. To those under law I became as under law

00:05:54.449 --> 00:06:02.689
though I myself am not under law in order to gain those under law. To those without law

00:06:02.769 --> 00:06:10.290
I became as without law although I am not without law toward God but under law toward Christ

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:18.529
in order to gain those without law. But I do all things for the sake of the good news in order to

00:06:18.529 --> 00:06:25.810
share it with others. The principle here is that we take into account how others feel about

00:06:26.449 --> 00:06:34.449
and view matters. Knowing how a certain symbol or custom is viewed in our own country or community

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:41.730
is very important. Something that is very offensive in our land or culture

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:48.370
may be viewed as completely innocent in another land or culture.

00:06:49.009 --> 00:06:57.009
Back in 1976, the Awake magazine posed this important question.

00:06:58.689 --> 00:07:06.050
What should be a Christian's attitude towards shapes and designs that have at some time or place

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:11.810
been connected with false religion? This question may be involved when you choose

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:19.649
wallpaper for your home, the print on a necktire dress or jewelry such as cufflinks,

00:07:19.649 --> 00:07:27.009
a bracelet or a necklace to purchase. It may even be of concern regarding the design of lamps or

00:07:27.009 --> 00:07:33.569
dishes. You might wonder, is this design somehow connected with idolatrous worship?

00:07:34.529 --> 00:07:41.410
Then it offered this key thought. Many times a design will change in significance

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:47.970
according to location and time. A certain shape may have a particular meaning to an observer

00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:55.170
at one time and place, but a different meaning to an observer elsewhere or in another age.

00:07:55.970 --> 00:08:02.689
So the Christian needs to be primarily concerned about what? Not what a certain symbol or design

00:08:02.689 --> 00:08:09.250
possibly meant thousands of years ago or how it might be thought of on the other side of the world,

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:17.329
but what it means now to most people where he lives. The article gave examples of common symbols

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:25.009
that at one time were associated with false worship, but no longer have that meaning today.

00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:33.409
The examples mentioned included the heart, the floor deli, and the pomegranate.

00:08:34.529 --> 00:08:40.690
The article concluded with this practical advice, with so many different designs,

00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:46.769
having been used in false worship, if a person went to the trouble and took the time,

00:08:46.769 --> 00:08:53.889
he might find an undesirable connection with almost every design he sees around him.

00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:59.169
But why do that? Would it not be needlessly upsetting?

00:09:00.049 --> 00:09:06.690
And is that the best use of one's time and attention? If a particular design or shape is commonly

00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:12.370
understood where you live to be a religious symbol, there is good reason to avoid it.

00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:18.690
Or if many people locally have become especially sensitive about some shape or decoration,

00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:26.049
the mature Christian might choose to shun it so as to avoid needless disturbance or stumbling.

00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:33.009
Those are helpful principles, aren't they? The same is true with customs.

00:09:34.289 --> 00:09:43.330
The way they are viewed can change over time. The awake of January 8, 2000 featured an article

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:55.090
entitled, a balanced view of popular customs. It observed customs have been profoundly influenced

00:09:55.090 --> 00:10:03.490
by religion. Many, in fact, arose from old superstitions and non-biblical religious ideas.

00:10:04.690 --> 00:10:12.049
The article mentions several examples. Some of these customs may have had false religious origins,

00:10:12.929 --> 00:10:20.529
yet the article noted. Over the years, however, the religious associations have faded,

00:10:20.529 --> 00:10:28.129
and today, these practices and customs have no religious significance. Then it asked,

00:10:28.129 --> 00:10:34.610
so what should a Christian primarily be concerned about? Although there may be reason to examine

00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:40.690
the origin of a particular custom, in some cases, it is more important to consider what the

00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:49.649
custom means to people at the time and in the place where one now lives. If a custom has unscriptural

00:10:49.649 --> 00:10:55.570
or otherwise negative connotations during a particular period of the year, or under certain

00:10:55.570 --> 00:11:04.049
circumstances, Christians may wisely decide to avoid it at that time. What are some common examples

00:11:04.129 --> 00:11:15.490
today? What about covering your mouth when yawning? In ancient times, some people did so because they

00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:25.330
thought it would prevent one soul from escaping. But what about today? Today it is commonly viewed as

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:34.289
a way of being polite and does not have a spiritistic meaning. What about wedding rings?

00:11:35.169 --> 00:11:43.009
Some historians claim wedding rings have pagan roots. Yet today, most people simply view

00:11:43.009 --> 00:11:52.929
wedding rings as a sign that the wearer is married. An example that illustrates the importance of

00:11:52.929 --> 00:12:01.409
timing is string lights. Many Bethelites here at Warwick enjoy putting white string lights on

00:12:01.409 --> 00:12:13.409
their balconies as decorations, except during November and December. Why not then? Because in this

00:12:13.409 --> 00:12:21.409
region of the world, string lights are closely associated with Christmas, a false religious holiday.

00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:30.529
So our Bethel family avoids even the appearance of participating in that false religious celebration.

00:12:32.289 --> 00:12:41.649
Another example is toasting our clinking glasses. For years, Jehovah's Witnesses have avoided this

00:12:41.649 --> 00:12:50.370
practice because it may have had origins in false religion. However, now, in most places,

00:12:51.169 --> 00:13:01.009
toasting our clinking glasses no longer has any religious association. It is viewed simply as a

00:13:01.009 --> 00:13:09.490
friendly custom. Therefore, after a prayerful consideration, the governing body has concluded

00:13:10.289 --> 00:13:16.690
that there is no need to make a rule regarding toasting and clinking glasses.

00:13:17.649 --> 00:13:24.929
Each Christian should use the principles that we have discussed in this update and his own

00:13:24.929 --> 00:13:34.210
Bible-trained conscience to make a good decision. What does this mean? Are we saying that toasting

00:13:34.210 --> 00:13:45.009
is okay now at all times and in every situation? Of course not. We are simply saying that there is

00:13:45.009 --> 00:13:54.129
no need to make a rule. Each Christian will need to use Bible principles to make a good decision

00:13:54.769 --> 00:14:04.129
in each instance. Since there are so many different situations it could arise in the 240 lands where

00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:14.450
Jehovah's people serve, what a blessing that Jehovah has given us these Bible principles.

00:14:16.529 --> 00:14:26.850
Let's briefly review them. First and most important, we love Jehovah and always want to

00:14:26.929 --> 00:14:33.809
please him. So we might ask ourselves, would Jehovah be offended by the toast?

00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:40.370
For example, is it associated with a religious or nationalistic holiday?

00:14:41.889 --> 00:14:51.730
Or is it a simple expression or gesture promoting friendship or health? Second,

00:14:52.690 --> 00:14:58.929
we love our brothers and sisters and would not want to needlessly offend them.

00:15:00.289 --> 00:15:09.570
We respect their feelings and their conscience. And third, because we love Jehovah and people,

00:15:10.529 --> 00:15:18.690
we are sensitive to how any custom is viewed in our own local culture or community.

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:30.129
Well, what have we learned? Jehovah doesn't burden us with endless rules. Instead, he lovingly

00:15:30.129 --> 00:15:40.450
provides principles in his word. These help us make wise, thoughtful, and loving decisions regarding

00:15:40.529 --> 00:15:49.490
symbols and customs. We're also reminded to respect the conscience of others and avoid imposing

00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:58.450
our personal views on others. Jehovah has given us freedom, and we respect the freedom that others

00:15:58.450 --> 00:16:09.809
have too. By applying Bible principles with love and discernment, we remain united and avoid

00:16:09.809 --> 00:16:19.970
stumbling others. What is our earnest prayer? It is just as the Apostle Paul expressed at Ephesians 4.13

00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:29.009
that we all attain to the oneness of the faith and of the accurate knowledge of the Son of God

00:16:29.809 --> 00:16:38.850
to being a full-grown man, attaining the measure of stature that belongs to the fullness of the

00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:48.610
Christ. Brothers and sisters, please know that we love you all very much.
