00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:11.660
Going back to prison is never easy, especially to a prison like Lamodello, the model prison in Barcelona.

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:17.660
This large penitentiary was built a century ago, with the intention of reforming criminals.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.660
But sadly, it never lived up to its name.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:26.660
Even suicides or murders were not uncommon in the galleries of this prison.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:32.659
This fearsome place was a staging prison, where young brothers from the Barcelona area were taken.

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:35.659
Once they refused military service.

00:00:35.659 --> 00:00:45.659
During the 1960s and 1970s, they were housed here for weeks, sometimes months, before being sent to military prisons.

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:53.659
In the fall of 2023, several former conscientious objectors decided to return.

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:58.659
These witnesses had been jailed in this prison some 50 years ago.

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:09.659
It was a bittersweet return for all of them, but they had a story to tell, and an exhibition at this former prison enabled them to do so.

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:22.060
Let us follow José Luis, a former inmate of this prison, as he accompanies a group of teenage witnesses who visit the exhibition.

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:27.060
It was a bitter return for José Luis in several ways.

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.060
He showed his young friends the same galleries where he was imprisoned.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:42.060
They entered the same cells where he had been housed, and he pointed out the booths where he had spoken to his young wife.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.060
This return to the prison triggered unpleasant flashbacks for José Luis.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:55.060
He recalled the fear and the loneliness he felt when he found himself thrust into this frightening environment.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:01.569
Let us listen in as he explains his experiences.

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:06.569
José Luis, how did you feel when you arrived in prison?

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:11.569
The worst moment I remember was arriving at Lamavela.

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:16.569
I still remember the sound of my cell door closing for the first time.

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:23.569
It was an extremely loud clang, and it was like that every day.

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:33.569
Every time the guard closed the door, it made me remember where I was, locked up and isolated.

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:37.569
There were other sounds that made me feel anxious.

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:47.900
Sometimes I would hear threats, or the screams of someone who was being beaten up, especially at night.

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.900
My life was reduced to a small space that I had to share with someone else.

00:02:52.900 --> 00:03:01.610
Who could be dangerous if I didn't treat him right?

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:08.610
But it was also a sweet return for José Luis. He had reason to look back with pride.

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.610
But José Luis, after so many years, how do you feel now?

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:21.610
As the years go by, the wounds have healed, and I have been able to overcome the trauma of my time in prison.

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.610
When I returned to the prison, I felt a deep satisfaction.

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:31.610
I had passed the test, and my faith was strong.

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:38.610
On the other hand, I had played a small part in getting recognition for conscientious objection in Spain.

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:45.610
It was definitely worth it. I did what José expected of me, and he protected me.

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:50.610
I feel as James said, we consider happy those who've endured.

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:54.610
Jehovah is very tender in affection and merciful.

00:03:54.610 --> 00:04:02.520
José Luis was also delighted to explain to his teenage friends,

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:07.520
who these days face different trials, how he could remain faithful.

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:13.520
And José Luis, how did you manage to keep your faith so strong in a place like this?

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:18.519
Well, at that time, we young brothers knew that this test would come.

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:23.519
So we tried to build ourselves up spiritually beforehand.

00:04:23.519 --> 00:04:30.519
Before coming here, I packed a Bible, which was confiscated when I arrived.

00:04:30.519 --> 00:04:34.519
But then, they gave it back to me at my request.

00:04:34.519 --> 00:04:42.519
And I must say that this Bible was a blessing for me, and I still keep it as a treasured possession.

00:04:42.519 --> 00:04:47.519
I also prayed to Jehovah, as I had never prayed before.

00:04:47.519 --> 00:04:52.519
And especially at night, I poured out my heart to Jehovah,

00:04:52.519 --> 00:04:57.519
and he helped me to clear my trouble thoughts and to completely rely on him.

00:04:57.519 --> 00:05:04.800
We were also able to preach from time to time, when other prisoners asked us why we were here.

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:11.779
The so-called model prison never lived up to its name,

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:18.779
but it did provide a setting where faithful brothers displayed a model of true Christian integrity.

00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:25.779
And the lessons that ones like José Luis himself learned can be passed on to the younger generation.

00:05:25.779 --> 00:05:33.779
No doubt about it, young witnesses today can also discover that happy are those who have endured.
