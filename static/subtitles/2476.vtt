00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:15.230
Wow that looks like me. I have a question. What is it my dear?

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:21.629
How do you get baptized? That's a good question. And an important one.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:26.760
I'm looks so young in this picture. Hey

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.280
Yes, you can be young like your mother

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.880
What matters is that you love Jehovah and

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.649
And when to follow Jesus teachings closely

00:00:40.689 --> 00:00:45.810
You can show that you want to get baptized by what you do like obeying your parents

00:00:47.409 --> 00:00:49.409
Learn about Jehovah by reading the Bible

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:56.770
That will help you obey Jehovah and avoid things that Jehovah hates

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.450
Then you'll want to share your faith with others

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:04.930
Especially in the ministry

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.879
And at the meetings

00:01:08.879 --> 00:01:11.200
Make friends with others who love Jehovah

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:14.879
And most importantly

00:01:14.879 --> 00:01:16.879
Tell Jehovah in prayer

00:01:16.879 --> 00:01:18.879
That you want to serve him forever

00:01:19.519 --> 00:01:21.519
That's why we get baptized in public

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.519
It shows others that we've dedicated our lives to Jehovah

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.680
That's so cool. Would you like to get baptized one day?

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.959
Why don't you learn a little more about the steps for baptism

00:01:35.599 --> 00:01:37.760
And share it with us at family worship

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.480
Okay
