00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.779
Welcome to JW Broadcasting.

00:00:03.779 --> 00:00:07.780
In this month's program, we'll see how Jehovah shepherds us

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:09.779
through any challenge.

00:00:09.779 --> 00:00:12.779
Here are some highlights of what's ahead.

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:15.779
In the exciting conclusion to Luda's story,

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:20.780
she must overcome her fears to make a stand for God's Kingdom.

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:23.780
Where can we find the strength to make needed changes?

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:28.780
A highly trained soldier tells us why he decided to leave the military

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:31.780
after learning the truth.

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:36.780
And our music video reminds us that joy and peace are possible now

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.780
as we wait for the real life to come.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.780
This is the May 2024 edition of JW Broadcasting.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:01:05.700
What do you see when you look at this picture?

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.700
Do you see yourself in it?

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.700
You should, but why?

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.700
This picture helps us to visualize the beautiful description

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.700
of Jehovah, founded Isaiah 40, verse 11.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.700
Like a shepherd, he will care for his flock.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.700
With his arm, he will gather to gather the lambs.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.700
And in his bosom, he will carry them.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.700
He will gently lead those nursing their young.

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.700
Jehovah bears many titles in the Bible,

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.700
but the designation shepherd is among the most tender.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.700
Like a shepherd, Jehovah says he will carry his lambs in his bosom,

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.700
illustrating his tender love and care for each one of his precious sheep.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.700
Look again at the picture.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.700
Is it hard for you to see yourself as a lamb nestled in the bosom of our shepherd Jehovah?

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.700
We know that many of you dear brothers and sisters are coping

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.699
with very difficult challenges day after day

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:12.699
in this cruel wicked world.

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:15.699
Such challenges can make it difficult for you to feel

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:20.699
like a lamb safe and secure in the bosom of our shepherd.

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:24.699
Please be assured that Jehovah is fully aware

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:27.699
of every challenge you face.

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:30.699
Why can you be so sure?

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:35.699
Let's read what David, the writer of Psalm 23, verse 4 says,

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:38.699
Though I walk in the valley of deep shadow,

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:40.699
I fear no harm.

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:47.699
For you are with me, your rod and your staff reassure me.

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:53.699
Much like a physical valley located deep in the shadows of nearby mountains,

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:58.699
a figurative valley can be used to describe a low point in one's life

00:02:58.699 --> 00:03:03.699
when we're feeling down, gloomy, or in a dark place.

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:10.699
When David wrote this Psalm, he was feeling down at a low point in his life.

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:14.699
Well, what valley of deep shadow are you currently going through?

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:19.699
Are you feeling overwhelmed with trying to provide for your family's needs?

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:24.699
Dealing with a serious health issue such as cancer?

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:30.699
Exhausted because you're caring for your mate or a parent with dementia?

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:33.699
Trying to cope with the death of a loved one?

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:39.699
Baddling feelings of loneliness, worthlessness, or anxiety?

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:42.699
Or facing persecution?

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:49.699
It's so difficult to remain positive when facing the darkest days of our life.

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:51.699
But there's a bright side.

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:53.699
What is that?

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:58.699
Jehovah is aware of the mountain-like obstacles that cause you to feel low

00:03:58.699 --> 00:04:01.699
as if you were in a valley of deep shadow.

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:06.699
He not only sees your pain, but he's ready to come to your rescue,

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:13.699
lift you up with his strong arms and embrace you like that lamb in the picture.

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:18.699
Psalm 23 is one of the most well-known passages in the Bible

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:25.699
and beautifully describes the loving way that our shepherd Jehovah leads, protects,

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:28.699
and feeds his precious sheep.

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:32.699
As we consider these three ways that Jehovah cares for us,

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:36.699
look for the answers to the following questions.

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:38.699
What does Jehovah do?

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:40.699
How does he do it?

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:43.699
And what do you need to do?

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:45.699
The first way.

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:48.699
Our shepherd leads us.

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:52.699
At Psalm 231, the theme of our discussion,

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:55.699
David expressed with full confidence,

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:57.699
Jehovah is my shepherd.

00:04:57.699 --> 00:04:59.699
I will lack nothing.

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:03.699
As a young man, David proved to be a capable shepherd

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:07.699
who tenderly cared for and protected his entire flock

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:12.699
and cared for the specific needs of each sheep.

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:17.699
Here in Psalm 23, David portrays himself not as a shepherd,

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:22.699
but as a humble sheep under the loving care of Jehovah,

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:26.699
affectionately calling him my shepherd.

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:31.699
During his lifetime, David experienced many highs and lows,

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:36.699
peaks, valleys, joys, and disappointments.

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:40.699
But whatever value of deep shadow he faced,

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:44.699
David always relied on his shepherd to lead him to safety

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:50.699
and provide exactly what he needed when he needed it.

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:53.699
With complete trust and confidence, he said,

00:05:53.699 --> 00:05:56.699
I will lack nothing.

00:05:56.699 --> 00:06:02.699
No wonder Psalm 23 has been called a psalm of assurance or trust.

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:06.069
What does our shepherd do?

00:06:06.069 --> 00:06:09.069
Verses 2 and 3 answer.

00:06:09.069 --> 00:06:12.069
In grassy pastures, he makes me lie down.

00:06:12.069 --> 00:06:16.069
He leads me to well-watered resting places.

00:06:16.069 --> 00:06:18.069
He refreshes me.

00:06:18.069 --> 00:06:23.069
He leads me in the paths of righteousness for the sake of his name.

00:06:23.069 --> 00:06:27.069
The watchtower once explained, David here paints a scene of

00:06:27.069 --> 00:06:32.069
contentment, refreshment, and security.

00:06:32.069 --> 00:06:37.069
Jehovah leads us to grassy pastures and tranquil waters.

00:06:37.069 --> 00:06:41.069
The Hebrew word rendered pastures can mean pleasant place.

00:06:42.069 --> 00:06:45.069
If we humbly follow our shepherd,

00:06:45.069 --> 00:06:49.069
he will lead us to a pleasant place where we can feel secure

00:06:49.069 --> 00:06:55.069
and have peace of mind, even when we're going through a valley of deep shadow.

00:06:55.069 --> 00:06:58.069
How does Jehovah lead us?

00:06:58.069 --> 00:07:02.069
By means of his word, he teaches us how to make wise decisions

00:07:02.069 --> 00:07:05.069
that lead to paths of righteousness,

00:07:05.069 --> 00:07:10.069
a life course that is pleasing to him and brings us happiness.

00:07:11.069 --> 00:07:15.069
He sets a course and a pace that we're able to follow,

00:07:15.069 --> 00:07:19.069
never expecting us to do more than we're able.

00:07:19.069 --> 00:07:24.069
Jehovah also leads us by means of undershepherds, the elders,

00:07:24.069 --> 00:07:29.069
who tenderly care for us spiritually, emotionally, and physically,

00:07:29.069 --> 00:07:33.069
so that we will lack nothing.

00:07:33.069 --> 00:07:35.069
What do you need to do?

00:07:35.069 --> 00:07:38.069
If you're going through a valley of deep shadow,

00:07:38.069 --> 00:07:43.069
search our many publications for specific Bible principles

00:07:43.069 --> 00:07:47.069
and helpful advice that can shed light on your present circumstances

00:07:47.069 --> 00:07:51.069
and provide practical ways to overcome difficulties

00:07:51.069 --> 00:07:55.069
or give you the patience to endure.

00:07:55.069 --> 00:08:00.069
Many find encouragement and comfort watching JW Broadcasting.

00:08:00.069 --> 00:08:03.069
In fact, one sister said,

00:08:03.069 --> 00:08:07.069
JW Broadcasting has helped me to be more positive.

00:08:07.069 --> 00:08:10.069
When I get lonely or discouraged,

00:08:10.069 --> 00:08:15.379
I find an encouraging talk or a morning worship program to watch.

00:08:15.379 --> 00:08:21.379
Are you benefiting from the monthly broadcasts, videos, and uplifting songs?

00:08:21.379 --> 00:08:26.379
The second way, our shepherd protects us.

00:08:26.379 --> 00:08:30.379
Let's read the second half of verse four.

00:08:30.379 --> 00:08:34.379
Your rod and your staff reassure me.

00:08:34.379 --> 00:08:39.379
David used a shepherd's rod and staff to illustrate Jehovah's protective care.

00:08:39.379 --> 00:08:43.379
Ancient shepherds used a rod to protect their sheep from predators,

00:08:43.379 --> 00:08:48.379
such as lions, bears, wolves, and snakes.

00:08:48.379 --> 00:08:54.379
They also used a staff to guide their sheep, gently nudging them in the right direction.

00:08:54.379 --> 00:08:59.379
Interestingly, some staffs had a hook at the end of the long stick

00:08:59.379 --> 00:09:06.379
that helped them as a shepherd gently draw back a sheep, strain, or nibbling into danger,

00:09:06.379 --> 00:09:10.379
guiding them back to the protection of the flock.

00:09:10.379 --> 00:09:16.379
The sheep certainly did not fear that the shepherd would use his rod or staff to beat them.

00:09:16.379 --> 00:09:19.379
What does Jehovah do?

00:09:19.379 --> 00:09:24.379
Our loving shepherd stands ready to use his figure of rod and staff to warn

00:09:24.379 --> 00:09:28.379
and protect us from predators seeking to harm us,

00:09:28.379 --> 00:09:36.379
especially from Satan, who in the Bible is portrayed as a vicious lion and a cunning serpent.

00:09:36.379 --> 00:09:43.379
Jehovah also has appointed elders in the congregation to warn and protect us from harmful influences

00:09:43.379 --> 00:09:48.379
and from taking a dangerous path in this wicked world.

00:09:48.379 --> 00:09:53.379
No doubt, you're filled with heartfelt appreciation and are comforted knowing

00:09:53.379 --> 00:10:01.379
that Jehovah is always on the lookout to use his figure of rod and staff to warn and protect us,

00:10:01.379 --> 00:10:03.379
not to beat us.

00:10:03.379 --> 00:10:08.379
If you strayed or nibbled away from the flock for whatever reason,

00:10:08.379 --> 00:10:16.379
please listen to Jehovah as he speaks to you through his written word, the Bible, and our brotherhood.

00:10:16.379 --> 00:10:22.379
Humbly follow the gentle nudging to lead you back to the safety of the congregation,

00:10:22.379 --> 00:10:30.379
where you'll enjoy lush, grassy pastures and refreshing well-watered resting places.

00:10:30.379 --> 00:10:39.379
Elders, you are entrusted with a privilege, but a heavy responsibility to protect Jehovah's precious sheep,

00:10:39.379 --> 00:10:42.379
whom he's placed under your care.

00:10:42.379 --> 00:10:50.379
We take this opportunity to express our sincere appreciation for those of you who use your figure of rod and staff

00:10:50.379 --> 00:10:59.379
to protect the sheep, never making them feel beaten down, but truly loved and appreciated.

00:10:59.379 --> 00:11:02.379
How does Jehovah protect us?

00:11:02.379 --> 00:11:06.379
He protects us as a group or flock.

00:11:06.379 --> 00:11:11.379
Satan will never succeed in wiping Jehovah's sheep from the earth.

00:11:11.379 --> 00:11:15.379
Jehovah also protects each sheep individually.

00:11:15.379 --> 00:11:17.379
How?

00:11:17.379 --> 00:11:21.379
Most important, he protects us spiritually.

00:11:21.379 --> 00:11:24.379
The draw close to Jehovah book explains,

00:11:24.379 --> 00:11:31.379
our loving God protects us from spiritual harm by equipping us with what we need in order to endure trials

00:11:31.379 --> 00:11:34.379
and to safeguard our relationship with him.

00:11:34.379 --> 00:11:42.379
Jehovah thus works to preserve our life, not just for a few short years, but for eternity.

00:11:43.379 --> 00:11:53.379
How reassuring that Jehovah makes sure that we have everything we need so that we will in effect lack nothing?

00:11:53.379 --> 00:11:56.379
What do you need to do?

00:11:56.379 --> 00:12:02.379
Take full advantage of the many provisions Jehovah makes available to protect us spiritually.

00:12:02.379 --> 00:12:09.379
Prayer, fellow worshippers, and timely spiritual food, which we'll discuss next.

00:12:10.379 --> 00:12:11.379
The third way.

00:12:11.379 --> 00:12:14.379
Our shepherd feeds us.

00:12:14.379 --> 00:12:18.379
Psalm 23 verses 5 and 6 reassures us,

00:12:18.379 --> 00:12:22.379
you prepare a table for me before my enemies.

00:12:22.379 --> 00:12:24.379
You refresh my head with oil.

00:12:24.379 --> 00:12:27.379
My cup is well filled.

00:12:27.379 --> 00:12:32.379
Surely goodness and loyal love will pursue me all the days of my life,

00:12:32.379 --> 00:12:36.379
and I will dwell in the house of Jehovah for all my days.

00:12:36.379 --> 00:12:38.379
What does Jehovah do?

00:12:38.379 --> 00:12:42.379
David now describes our shepherd as a generous host,

00:12:42.379 --> 00:12:50.379
who spreads before us his invited guests delicious and nutritious food and drink in great abundance.

00:12:50.379 --> 00:12:53.379
How does Jehovah feed us?

00:12:53.379 --> 00:12:58.379
Through the Faithland Discrete Slave, Jehovah gives us timely publications,

00:12:58.379 --> 00:13:04.379
as well as rich spiritual programs at our meetings, assemblies, conventions,

00:13:04.379 --> 00:13:08.379
JW broadcasting, governing body updates,

00:13:08.379 --> 00:13:13.379
along with encouraging songs and videos, and so much more.

00:13:13.379 --> 00:13:17.379
Truly, the slave is giving us food at the proper time,

00:13:17.379 --> 00:13:20.379
what we need when we need it.

00:13:20.379 --> 00:13:24.379
We certainly lack nothing spiritually.

00:13:24.379 --> 00:13:27.379
What do you need to do?

00:13:27.379 --> 00:13:32.379
Show your appreciation for the food the slave provides by eating it

00:13:32.379 --> 00:13:37.379
and never being fussy, picky, or selective in your eating habits.

00:13:37.379 --> 00:13:43.379
Remember, the Bible and Bible-based publications are ways that Jehovah speaks to us

00:13:43.379 --> 00:13:48.379
in effect saying, this is the way, walk in it, my precious sheep.

00:13:48.379 --> 00:13:53.379
As we read the Bible and meditate on the verses that touch our heart,

00:13:53.379 --> 00:13:58.379
we'll be better equipped to correct any faulty thinking that could lead us

00:13:58.379 --> 00:14:07.379
to dark feelings of anxiety, loneliness, worthlessness, anger, or resentment.

00:14:07.379 --> 00:14:13.379
Like David, be determined to dwell in the house of Jehovah for all your days.

00:14:13.379 --> 00:14:18.379
Continue attending our upbuilding meetings, assemblies, and conventions

00:14:18.379 --> 00:14:23.379
where we receive spiritual nourishment and protection.

00:14:23.379 --> 00:14:27.379
A sister who has traversed various valleys of deep shadow

00:14:27.379 --> 00:14:32.379
expressed what helps her to stay focused and keep on enduring.

00:14:32.379 --> 00:14:34.379
She said,

00:14:34.379 --> 00:14:36.379
depressive thoughts are not trustworthy.

00:14:36.379 --> 00:14:42.379
They are the product of a treacherous heart that distorts our thinking abilities.

00:14:42.379 --> 00:14:48.379
But because I trust Jehovah completely, each Bible verse proves to be

00:14:48.379 --> 00:14:56.379
like a solid stepping stone that enables me to gradually climb out of my many valleys of deep shadow.

00:14:56.379 --> 00:15:02.379
Our sister expressed so well how we feel about our loving shepherd

00:15:02.379 --> 00:15:09.379
who promises to help us successfully navigate through any valley of deep shadow.

00:15:09.379 --> 00:15:13.379
Isn't this a beautiful picture of a shepherd with his sheep?

00:15:13.379 --> 00:15:18.379
It's a door in the governing body conference room since the 1970s.

00:15:18.379 --> 00:15:23.379
It's a visual reminder of the importance of their work as shepherds.

00:15:23.379 --> 00:15:28.379
Brother Loach, a member of the governing body since 1994,

00:15:28.379 --> 00:15:34.379
recently explained what this inspiring painting has meant to him throughout the decades.

00:15:34.379 --> 00:15:37.379
Enjoy the following video segment.

00:15:37.379 --> 00:15:44.379
His painting in the governing body conference room shows the shepherd and his sheep

00:15:44.379 --> 00:15:51.379
and the shepherd is caring for the sheep and they feel obviously comfortable and protected.

00:15:51.379 --> 00:15:57.379
And they do that despite, as you can see in the background, stormy weather.

00:15:57.379 --> 00:16:00.379
But the sheep feel just fine.

00:16:00.379 --> 00:16:03.379
In connection with the application in the Bible,

00:16:03.379 --> 00:16:09.379
the Bible shows that Jehovah God is a shepherd and cares for us as his sheep.

00:16:09.379 --> 00:16:13.379
But so is Jesus Christ. He is called the fine shepherd.

00:16:13.379 --> 00:16:23.379
And what are shepherds to do? Well, shepherds lead the sheep, feed the sheep,

00:16:23.379 --> 00:16:32.379
shepherds protect the sheep, but then shepherds also care for injured or ailing sheep.

00:16:32.379 --> 00:16:36.379
But the fact is that all of God's people are sheep.

00:16:36.379 --> 00:16:44.379
And so we have the privilege to follow the lead of Jehovah and Jesus and the elders

00:16:44.379 --> 00:16:49.379
and work together in unity. At the governing body meeting,

00:16:49.379 --> 00:17:00.379
we sometimes look at the picture and we try to apply what is implied in the painting

00:17:00.379 --> 00:17:05.380
to our work with the congregations and the worldwide flock.

00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:09.380
Thank you, brother Loach, for sharing those encouraging comments with us.

00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:15.380
How reassuring it is to know that our loving shepherds on the governing body

00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:21.380
take their responsibility to lead, protect, and feed you, me,

00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:24.380
and all of Jehovah's precious sheep very seriously.

00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:29.380
May we all continue to humbly and obediently follow their lead

00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:33.380
as we follow closely the lead of our great shepherd Jehovah

00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:38.380
and in the footsteps of our fine shepherd and King Jesus.

00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:45.380
Never forget that Jehovah is not just our shepherd, he is your shepherd,

00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:52.380
he is my shepherd, with Jehovah our shepherd leading, protecting, and feeding us.

00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:58.380
We can face a future with complete confidence and echo the words that David used to introduce

00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:03.380
this beautiful and reassuring psalm, the words contained at Psalm 23.

00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:08.380
Jehovah is my shepherd, I will lack nothing.

00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:14.789
One of the many valleys of deep shadow that we can pass through is war.

00:18:14.789 --> 00:18:20.789
Along with physical and emotional strain, it can threaten our loyalty to God's kingdom.

00:18:21.789 --> 00:18:26.789
How can we overcome fear and stand with Jehovah?

00:18:26.789 --> 00:18:30.789
The following dramatization takes us into the heart of a conflict

00:18:30.789 --> 00:18:35.789
and is based on the real life experiences of some of our brothers and sisters.

00:18:35.789 --> 00:18:43.789
Though I walk in the valley of deep shadow, I fear no harm for you are with me.

00:18:43.789 --> 00:19:19.890
Those words felt new when the fighting started again.

00:19:19.890 --> 00:19:23.890
But the family that took us in was a gift from Jehovah,

00:19:23.890 --> 00:19:37.240
while we waited for the trains to start running again.

00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:39.240
We tried our best to help others.

00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:48.259
They're nearly finished, I'm going to go help them clean up.

00:19:48.259 --> 00:19:58.859
Luda.

00:19:58.859 --> 00:20:00.859
Yaki.

00:20:00.859 --> 00:20:03.859
I know her from school.

00:20:03.859 --> 00:20:10.640
This is my brother Pablo, he protects this whole area.

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:13.640
I'm surprised you're still here.

00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:15.640
You too.

00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:18.640
Why? I stayed to help the fight.

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:20.640
Where else would I be?

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:22.640
Oh, no, I just meant...

00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:23.640
This is our home.

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:28.269
Everybody has to do their part to support the war.

00:20:28.269 --> 00:20:32.339
I'm...

00:20:32.339 --> 00:20:42.089
You're what?

00:20:42.089 --> 00:20:44.089
Jesus Jehovah.

00:20:44.089 --> 00:20:46.089
They don't care about the country.

00:20:46.089 --> 00:20:49.089
Oh, the cowards.

00:20:49.089 --> 00:21:03.069
Your people should be shot.

00:21:03.069 --> 00:21:08.329
Let's go.

00:21:08.329 --> 00:21:09.329
I just froze.

00:21:09.329 --> 00:21:14.559
Fear is natural.

00:21:14.559 --> 00:21:19.150
We all get afraid.

00:21:19.150 --> 00:21:23.150
But let's look at what Jesus told us.

00:21:23.150 --> 00:21:31.119
However, when they hand you over,

00:21:31.119 --> 00:21:36.119
do not become anxious about how or what you are to speak.

00:21:36.119 --> 00:21:41.119
For what you are to speak will be given you in that hour.

00:21:41.119 --> 00:21:46.119
So, let's talk about what you can say,

00:21:46.119 --> 00:21:52.119
because when you have Jehovah's thoughts in here,

00:21:52.119 --> 00:21:55.119
you will always give you the words when you need them.

00:21:55.119 --> 00:22:09.740
Today is the day we'll try to leave.

00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:12.740
We have brothers and sisters waiting for us.

00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:16.740
After all these weeks, it may finally happen.

00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:23.700
At your tickets, an ID ready.

00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:35.819
One at a time.

00:22:35.819 --> 00:22:37.819
Go ahead, I'm right behind you.

00:22:37.819 --> 00:22:43.700
Leaving the country?

00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:45.700
Yes.

00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:49.700
Me, my mother and my grandma are leaving.

00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:52.700
We're giving priority to the week and sick.

00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:55.700
And there's a lot you can do here.

00:22:55.700 --> 00:22:57.700
Don't you care about your country?

00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:11.740
I respect our country, but I am loyal to God.

00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:15.740
I support God's kingdom first.

00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:17.740
I think we make you stay.

00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:19.740
Go back.

00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:21.740
Hold on.

00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:25.369
God's kingdom?

00:23:25.369 --> 00:23:29.769
Did you say God's kingdom?

00:23:29.769 --> 00:23:34.529
My father, he was one of you.

00:23:34.529 --> 00:23:44.529
I don't agree with your beliefs.

00:23:44.529 --> 00:23:47.529
But I know you're good people.

00:23:47.529 --> 00:23:54.980
So you and your family get on the train.

00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:56.980
Do not become anxious.

00:23:56.980 --> 00:24:00.980
For what you are to speak will be given you.

00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:03.980
I didn't know how Jehovah would do it.

00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:06.980
But I put my trust in him.

00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:10.980
And he showed me that I have nothing to fear.

00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:20.650
Our shepherd has promised to give us the right words at the right time.

00:24:20.650 --> 00:24:25.650
Inscribe his thoughts on your heart now before the trial.

00:24:25.650 --> 00:24:27.650
And you'll have nothing to fear.

00:24:27.650 --> 00:24:31.650
As Yerg began to study the Bible with Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:24:31.650 --> 00:24:34.650
God's thoughts were inscribed on his heart.

00:24:34.650 --> 00:24:40.650
He needed to make a choice, serving the army, or serve God.

00:24:40.650 --> 00:24:44.650
How would he find the strength to completely change his life?

00:24:44.650 --> 00:24:45.650
Let's see.

00:24:45.650 --> 00:24:50.019
I was born in the northern of Germany.

00:24:50.019 --> 00:24:53.019
I didn't have a very good relationship to my father,

00:24:53.019 --> 00:24:56.019
because he drank a lot.

00:24:56.019 --> 00:24:59.019
And very often he was mean to me.

00:24:59.019 --> 00:25:03.019
On the other hand, my mother really, she was kind, lovely.

00:25:03.019 --> 00:25:08.019
And I can tell you, I love my mother from the bottom of my heart.

00:25:09.019 --> 00:25:14.019
One day, the doctors diagnosed it that she has cancer.

00:25:14.019 --> 00:25:19.019
And only a few days later, she died, and she was gone.

00:25:19.019 --> 00:25:22.019
And this was for me, horrible, I tell you.

00:25:22.019 --> 00:25:27.980
I feel completely empty, no hope, angry.

00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:30.980
I couldn't understand, really, I couldn't get it.

00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:34.980
How a God can be so painful to others,

00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:37.980
and take the best of what I had in my life, just take it away.

00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:44.119
I hate everything around me.

00:25:44.119 --> 00:25:46.119
I will never trust anyone.

00:25:46.119 --> 00:25:51.119
And especially, I lost also the trust completely in God.

00:25:51.119 --> 00:25:55.119
And therefore, I decide to go to the German Air Force.

00:25:55.119 --> 00:25:59.460
It starts with a basic training.

00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:02.460
So the ideas we have to follow orders,

00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:04.460
doesn't matter what happens.

00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:08.460
So a special training was also hand-to-hand combat.

00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:10.460
And this gives you a lot of confidence.

00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:13.460
You're saying nobody can hurt you once again.

00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:15.460
You feel very strong.

00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:20.460
I remember some situation we were outside in the woods,

00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:22.460
and this was part of a survival training.

00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:27.460
I felt inextractible and were very proud of myself.

00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:30.460
So a little later, on my military career,

00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:34.460
I was working with a missile launch crew.

00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:40.460
One day, I realized that just with one launch of this missile,

00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:45.460
I could be responsible for to kill thousands of people.

00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:47.460
When all this comes to my mind,

00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:52.460
I start to think, is it possible there is a God existing?

00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:57.460
And when so, how would he think about my work what I'm doing here?

00:26:57.460 --> 00:27:00.460
There was in my family my aunt,

00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:02.460
and once she told me,

00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:08.460
Dear, if someday you will like to know something more about God about the Bible,

00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:10.460
you have to contact Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:13.460
They know exactly what is the prophecy from the Bible,

00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:15.460
and this can give you hope.

00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:17.460
And from there on, I studied the Bible,

00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:20.460
and also I came to the meetings from them.

00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:24.460
So in one meeting, my wife, Alvia, sitting beside me,

00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:27.460
I was sure I have to make a big change.

00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:31.460
To be together with these people who loves Jehovah God,

00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:36.460
and I am still working for the German Air Force.

00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:39.900
I decided, officially,

00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:44.900
refuse the military service because my country was in buzz on me.

00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:48.900
I felt very confident that this was the right decision to do.

00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:50.900
So at that core day,

00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:52.900
and this was surprising for me,

00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:57.900
they told me that my request will be rejected.

00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:02.900
If I refuse to go on with my military service,

00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:04.900
I will be sent to prison.

00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:06.900
I really didn't know what to do.

00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:11.900
And then I saw that Jehovah took over.

00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:13.900
My side commander told me,

00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:14.900
Do you know what?

00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:15.900
I have a solution for you.

00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:18.900
You can appeal the court decision.

00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:21.900
He offered me an office job.

00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:26.900
So the only thing I have to do was a paperwork,

00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:28.900
and a shift from eight hours.

00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:30.900
I was finished after two hours.

00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:31.900
I was done with this.

00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:33.900
Six months.

00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:35.900
Five days a week.

00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:36.900
Six hours a day.

00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:38.900
I was just starting and studying.

00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:42.900
I felt not only that I drove closer to Jehovah.

00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:46.900
I also was convinced now that in the past time,

00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:49.900
I was just relying on myself.

00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:50.900
I trust only me.

00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:55.900
But now I got the opportunity to lay everything

00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:58.900
what I needed to Jehovah.

00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:02.900
Evie and I, we got really deeply discussions.

00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:04.900
I am prison, and she alone.

00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:09.900
I was wondering how she could take care on herself.

00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:11.900
If I have to go to prison,

00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:15.900
we still, we stick to Jehovah and to his ways.

00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:19.859
So if the court arrived,

00:29:19.859 --> 00:29:21.859
I asked Jehovah,

00:29:21.859 --> 00:29:23.859
please Jehovah, give me the strength,

00:29:23.859 --> 00:29:25.859
and also the wisdom and the right words

00:29:25.859 --> 00:29:28.859
to bring glory fire on his name.

00:29:28.859 --> 00:29:30.859
After the hearing,

00:29:30.859 --> 00:29:33.859
the providing judge told me,

00:29:33.859 --> 00:29:35.859
when the decision is made,

00:29:35.859 --> 00:29:37.859
it will be final.

00:29:37.859 --> 00:29:39.859
So back in my unit,

00:29:39.859 --> 00:29:41.859
the next days, they were horrible.

00:29:41.859 --> 00:29:45.859
One day, my side commander came in into my office,

00:29:45.859 --> 00:29:48.859
and he got a very, very serious face.

00:29:48.859 --> 00:29:49.859
Wow.

00:29:49.859 --> 00:29:50.859
I knew what was coming up.

00:29:50.859 --> 00:29:53.859
I was seeing me already behind the bars.

00:29:54.859 --> 00:29:56.859
Then surprising, he told me,

00:29:56.859 --> 00:30:00.859
hey, this is a set news for me.

00:30:00.859 --> 00:30:02.859
The decision is made.

00:30:02.859 --> 00:30:04.859
You are free to go.

00:30:04.859 --> 00:30:08.859
And I will lose my best officer what I have.

00:30:08.859 --> 00:30:10.859
In this moment,

00:30:10.859 --> 00:30:13.859
well, I remember the tears comes out.

00:30:13.859 --> 00:30:15.859
I couldn't hide it back.

00:30:15.859 --> 00:30:18.859
And I was so thankful to Jehovah,

00:30:18.859 --> 00:30:20.859
and I felt really,

00:30:20.859 --> 00:30:22.859
as the best decision I made

00:30:22.859 --> 00:30:24.859
to stick to Jehovah,

00:30:24.859 --> 00:30:26.859
and not to man.

00:30:26.859 --> 00:30:28.859
So Elvian I,

00:30:28.859 --> 00:30:30.859
we dedicated our life,

00:30:30.859 --> 00:30:32.859
completely to Jehovah,

00:30:32.859 --> 00:30:34.859
and now, because the privilege to serve him,

00:30:34.859 --> 00:30:36.859
almost 50 years together.

00:30:36.859 --> 00:30:38.859
The scripture,

00:30:38.859 --> 00:30:40.859
at Isaiah 40,

00:30:40.859 --> 00:30:41.859
verses 10 and 11,

00:30:41.859 --> 00:30:43.859
comes really to my mind.

00:30:43.859 --> 00:30:45.859
Jehovah will come with power,

00:30:45.859 --> 00:30:46.859
like a shepherd,

00:30:46.859 --> 00:30:48.859
he will care for his flock,

00:30:48.859 --> 00:30:50.859
but certainly he did.

00:30:50.859 --> 00:30:53.859
It doesn't matter what Satan ever brings to you.

00:30:53.859 --> 00:30:55.859
This relationship with Jehovah

00:30:55.859 --> 00:30:57.859
leads always to success.

00:30:57.859 --> 00:31:03.099
As Brother Hoekker gradually progressed spiritually,

00:31:03.099 --> 00:31:07.099
he made decisions to match God's standards.

00:31:07.099 --> 00:31:09.099
He specifically asked Jehovah

00:31:09.099 --> 00:31:12.099
for the power to follow through on his decisions.

00:31:12.099 --> 00:31:15.099
And we're happy that with time,

00:31:15.099 --> 00:31:16.099
and Jehovah's help,

00:31:16.099 --> 00:31:18.099
he was able to bring his life in harmony

00:31:18.099 --> 00:31:21.099
with Jehovah's standards.

00:31:21.099 --> 00:31:24.099
But what if our choice is not about right,

00:31:24.099 --> 00:31:25.099
or wrong?

00:31:25.099 --> 00:31:29.099
What if it's more about choosing from many options?

00:31:29.099 --> 00:31:32.099
In this episode of Lessons from the Watchtower,

00:31:32.099 --> 00:31:36.099
see how these young people were able to use Bible principles

00:31:36.099 --> 00:31:38.099
when choosing employment.

00:31:38.099 --> 00:31:54.289
When I first started having some health problems,

00:31:54.289 --> 00:31:57.289
my biggest concern was my goals.

00:31:57.289 --> 00:32:01.910
With health situations,

00:32:01.910 --> 00:32:05.910
it's easy to get overwhelmed.

00:32:05.910 --> 00:32:08.910
I had to find a part-time job

00:32:08.910 --> 00:32:11.910
that is agreeable to my pioneering schedule

00:32:11.910 --> 00:32:15.859
and to my energy levels.

00:32:15.859 --> 00:32:17.859
I was offered after high school the opportunity

00:32:17.859 --> 00:32:22.859
to attend a prestigious university for no cost.

00:32:22.859 --> 00:32:25.859
But Jehovah invites you to rely on him,

00:32:25.859 --> 00:32:30.710
not to rely on yourself.

00:32:30.710 --> 00:32:33.710
Growing up, my family didn't have a lot materially.

00:32:33.710 --> 00:32:36.710
It caused me to have a tendency

00:32:36.710 --> 00:32:40.710
to want to rely on myself instead of Jehovah.

00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:43.710
I realized that I needed to have more trust in Jehovah,

00:32:43.710 --> 00:32:48.710
and that was going to require working on my faith.

00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:51.710
These relates were given a wonderful provision from Jehovah

00:32:51.710 --> 00:32:54.710
when they were hungry in a need of food of mana,

00:32:54.710 --> 00:32:58.059
and they had to show contentment

00:32:58.059 --> 00:33:02.059
throughout the whole 40 years of them being in the wilderness.

00:33:02.059 --> 00:33:05.059
It's not ideal to have to cut back on things

00:33:05.059 --> 00:33:06.059
for financial reasons,

00:33:06.059 --> 00:33:09.059
but being okay with it and adapting to it

00:33:09.059 --> 00:33:11.059
that shows Jehovah that we're content

00:33:11.059 --> 00:33:13.059
with what he's given us,

00:33:13.059 --> 00:33:15.059
and it helps us to be able to enjoy life

00:33:15.059 --> 00:33:18.059
and enjoy our full-time ministry that way.

00:33:18.059 --> 00:33:20.059
I appreciated David's example

00:33:20.059 --> 00:33:24.059
because he stuck to Jehovah through several trials,

00:33:24.059 --> 00:33:27.059
and each time he saw Jehovah's hand,

00:33:27.059 --> 00:33:30.059
and I thought that must have impressed on him,

00:33:30.059 --> 00:33:32.059
the importance of relying on Jehovah,

00:33:32.059 --> 00:33:35.059
and it probably helped him to have faith

00:33:35.059 --> 00:33:39.059
that Jehovah was going to be there again the next time.

00:33:39.059 --> 00:33:41.059
We were pioneering in our hometown.

00:33:41.059 --> 00:33:43.059
We had everything we needed.

00:33:43.059 --> 00:33:47.059
I was set up with a job where I could work three days a week,

00:33:47.059 --> 00:33:49.059
and it was the perfect pioneer job,

00:33:49.059 --> 00:33:50.059
but we wanted something more,

00:33:50.059 --> 00:33:53.059
so we decided to move where the need was greater

00:33:53.059 --> 00:33:54.059
in the Chinese field.

00:33:54.059 --> 00:33:56.059
I decided to find a part-time job

00:33:56.059 --> 00:33:59.059
that provided the means necessary

00:33:59.059 --> 00:34:02.059
to pay for things like food and clothing,

00:34:02.059 --> 00:34:04.059
but really it was going to provide me with an opportunity

00:34:04.059 --> 00:34:06.059
to focus on that service to Jehovah.

00:34:06.059 --> 00:34:10.059
After some time, I realized that the job I had originally taken

00:34:10.059 --> 00:34:14.059
was not providing what I needed anymore.

00:34:14.059 --> 00:34:16.059
A change was necessary.

00:34:16.059 --> 00:34:19.059
So another opportunity came up

00:34:19.059 --> 00:34:21.059
to pursue higher education.

00:34:21.059 --> 00:34:22.059
While I was considering my options

00:34:22.059 --> 00:34:24.059
a friend recommended a job

00:34:24.059 --> 00:34:27.059
that required a little bit of vocational training,

00:34:27.059 --> 00:34:33.420
but would pay to cover my expenses.

00:34:33.420 --> 00:34:38.420
Psalm 23 and verse 1 has absolutely been true for us.

00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:41.420
There's never been a moment where we went hungry.

00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:46.420
There's never been a moment where we didn't have what we needed.

00:34:46.420 --> 00:34:49.420
And challenges have come up.

00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:52.420
He's always led us through those challenges

00:34:52.420 --> 00:34:54.420
and helped us to overcome.

00:34:54.420 --> 00:34:57.420
I was able to find a way to work remotely from home

00:34:57.420 --> 00:34:59.420
so I could control my energy level

00:34:59.420 --> 00:35:03.420
and I could control my own schedule.

00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:06.420
Ministry has been such a comfort

00:35:06.420 --> 00:35:08.420
since a spare back as I can remember

00:35:08.420 --> 00:35:10.420
for any child we face.

00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:14.420
Just going in service, we always come home smiling.

00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:18.420
For us, it was always, if you can do it, do it

00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:22.420
because it will make you happy and will make life more enjoyable.

00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:25.420
Working at the Assembly Hall is an enormous privilege.

00:35:25.420 --> 00:35:28.420
It's great to work in Jehovah's organization

00:35:28.420 --> 00:35:31.420
and see how it works to receive training.

00:35:31.420 --> 00:35:34.420
And at the same time, it's an opportunity

00:35:34.420 --> 00:35:38.420
to meet even more people who are all putting Jehovah first.

00:35:38.420 --> 00:35:42.420
Looking back on it, I realized that Jehovah gave us that time

00:35:42.420 --> 00:35:45.420
to work for him so that he could show his power to us

00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:47.420
in a way that was undeniable.

00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:49.420
When this watchtower came out, I said,

00:35:49.420 --> 00:35:52.420
everything is true.

00:35:52.420 --> 00:35:54.420
Every single principle,

00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:56.420
the taste and see that Jehovah is good

00:35:56.420 --> 00:35:59.420
and Jehovah is my shepherd, I'll lack nothing.

00:35:59.420 --> 00:36:01.420
It's all true.

00:36:01.420 --> 00:36:22.380
My experience, my life, has been a testimony to that.

00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:26.380
These young ones have lives filled with purpose and joy

00:36:26.380 --> 00:36:29.380
and are truly lacking nothing good.

00:36:29.380 --> 00:36:33.380
And did you notice how they worked in harmony with their prayers?

00:36:33.380 --> 00:36:36.380
Brother Let discussed specific ways

00:36:36.380 --> 00:36:38.380
we can work with Jehovah's hand

00:36:38.380 --> 00:36:41.380
in this morning worship program.

00:36:41.380 --> 00:36:43.380
The theme for this discussion

00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:48.380
is Jehovah's hand is awe-inspiring.

00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:52.380
The human hand is an amazing creation.

00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:56.380
It enables us to apply the power of our arm

00:36:56.380 --> 00:36:59.380
in very dexterous and versatile ways.

00:36:59.380 --> 00:37:02.380
We can swing a sledgehammer.

00:37:02.380 --> 00:37:04.380
We can thread a tiny sewing needle.

00:37:04.380 --> 00:37:10.380
The human hand is far superior to any animal's hand.

00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:15.380
One advantage, only humans have an opposing thumb

00:37:15.380 --> 00:37:19.380
that can easily touch our four other fingers.

00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:22.380
To illustrate the human hand superiority,

00:37:22.380 --> 00:37:25.380
imagine an ape whose hand you see here,

00:37:25.380 --> 00:37:29.380
trying to take a pin and precisely sign his name,

00:37:29.380 --> 00:37:33.380
or trying to throw a curveball with a baseball.

00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:37.380
But as amazing as the human hand is,

00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:41.380
Jehovah's hand is far more amazing.

00:37:41.380 --> 00:37:45.380
In fact, it is awe-inspiring.

00:37:45.380 --> 00:37:47.380
But what is Jehovah's hand?

00:37:47.380 --> 00:37:49.380
Well, here's one definition.

00:37:49.380 --> 00:37:53.380
Jehovah's hand is his ability to apply the great power

00:37:53.380 --> 00:37:57.380
of his Holy Spirit in various ways.

00:37:57.380 --> 00:38:00.380
In fact, let's discuss four examples

00:38:00.380 --> 00:38:03.380
of Jehovah using his awe-inspiring hand

00:38:03.380 --> 00:38:07.380
to apply the great power of his Holy Spirit.

00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:10.380
And then, after we discuss each one,

00:38:10.380 --> 00:38:13.380
we'll comment just briefly on how we can work in harmony

00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:16.380
with this specific use of Jehovah's hand.

00:38:16.380 --> 00:38:18.380
Now, let's go to Proverbs 21.

00:38:18.380 --> 00:38:22.380
Today's scripture text, let's read it again.

00:38:22.380 --> 00:38:28.380
Proverbs 211, a king's heart is like streams of water

00:38:28.380 --> 00:38:31.380
in Jehovah's hand.

00:38:31.380 --> 00:38:35.380
He directs it wherever he pleases.

00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:37.380
Now, what is this telling as well?

00:38:37.380 --> 00:38:39.380
In order to accomplish his will,

00:38:39.380 --> 00:38:41.380
Jehovah can maneuver the heart

00:38:41.380 --> 00:38:43.380
of any government official

00:38:43.380 --> 00:38:46.380
to do something or not do something.

00:38:46.380 --> 00:38:48.380
Now, here's one Bible example.

00:38:48.380 --> 00:38:51.380
Persian king artiser Z's

00:38:51.380 --> 00:38:54.380
granted all of Ezra's requests.

00:38:54.380 --> 00:38:56.380
Amazingly, he did this.

00:38:56.380 --> 00:39:00.380
About going to Jerusalem and advancing pure worship.

00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:03.380
Well, what motivated the king's heart to do this?

00:39:03.380 --> 00:39:05.380
Ezra knew whether credit belonged.

00:39:05.380 --> 00:39:08.380
At Ezra 727, he said,

00:39:08.380 --> 00:39:11.380
may Jehovah be praised?

00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:13.380
Who put it into the heart of the king

00:39:13.380 --> 00:39:17.380
to beautify the house of Jehovah in Jerusalem?

00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:19.380
Now, that's just one Bible example of many

00:39:19.380 --> 00:39:21.380
that could be discussed.

00:39:21.380 --> 00:39:22.380
But now, a question,

00:39:22.380 --> 00:39:24.380
how can we work in harmony

00:39:24.380 --> 00:39:27.380
with this use of Jehovah's hand?

00:39:27.380 --> 00:39:28.380
Well, for one thing,

00:39:28.380 --> 00:39:30.380
we can pray,

00:39:30.380 --> 00:39:32.380
if it be Jehovah's will,

00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:34.380
that he maneuver the hearts

00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:36.380
of government officials

00:39:36.380 --> 00:39:38.380
to make decisions

00:39:38.380 --> 00:39:41.380
that will benefit Jehovah's people.

00:39:41.380 --> 00:39:43.380
We can also pray for Jehovah

00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:45.380
to move the hearts of officials

00:39:45.380 --> 00:39:49.380
to treat our imprisoned brothers kindly.

00:39:49.380 --> 00:39:52.380
And that's in harmony with Hebrews 13-3,

00:39:52.380 --> 00:39:54.380
with beautiful scripture,

00:39:54.380 --> 00:39:56.380
keep in mind those in prison,

00:39:56.380 --> 00:40:00.380
as though you were imprisoned with them.

00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:01.380
Isn't that interesting?

00:40:01.380 --> 00:40:03.380
Keep in mind those in prison,

00:40:03.380 --> 00:40:06.380
as though you were imprisoned with them.

00:40:06.380 --> 00:40:08.380
Now, let's go to Isaiah 41,

00:40:08.380 --> 00:40:10.380
and we'll get our second example

00:40:10.380 --> 00:40:13.380
of how Jehovah can use his hand.

00:40:13.380 --> 00:40:15.380
Isaiah 41, verse 10,

00:40:15.380 --> 00:40:18.380
the B part, Jehovah says,

00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:21.380
I will really hold on to you

00:40:21.380 --> 00:40:25.380
with my right hand of righteousness.

00:40:25.380 --> 00:40:27.380
Then look at verse 13,

00:40:27.380 --> 00:40:29.380
for I, Jehovah your God,

00:40:29.380 --> 00:40:32.380
am grasping your right hand.

00:40:32.380 --> 00:40:34.380
The one saying to you,

00:40:34.380 --> 00:40:36.380
do not be afraid,

00:40:36.380 --> 00:40:37.380
I will help you.

00:40:37.380 --> 00:40:39.380
Now, interestingly,

00:40:39.380 --> 00:40:41.380
this scripture is not talking about Jehovah,

00:40:41.380 --> 00:40:43.380
taking his right hand

00:40:43.380 --> 00:40:45.380
and grabbing our left hand,

00:40:45.380 --> 00:40:47.380
as would be true in walking side-by-side,

00:40:48.380 --> 00:40:49.380
but rather,

00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:50.380
Jehovah takes his right hand,

00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:51.380
grabs our right hand,

00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:52.380
as would be true,

00:40:52.380 --> 00:40:54.380
of Jehovah pulling us up

00:40:54.380 --> 00:40:56.380
and out of a pit.

00:40:56.380 --> 00:40:58.380
So what do we learn from this,

00:40:58.380 --> 00:41:02.380
that Jehovah can rescue us

00:41:02.380 --> 00:41:04.380
from any situation,

00:41:04.380 --> 00:41:06.380
no matter how hopeless,

00:41:06.380 --> 00:41:09.380
how desperate it might seem.

00:41:09.380 --> 00:41:10.380
But now, a question,

00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:12.380
how can we work in harmony

00:41:12.380 --> 00:41:15.380
with this specific use of Jehovah's hand?

00:41:15.380 --> 00:41:17.380
Well, for one thing,

00:41:17.380 --> 00:41:19.380
we can supplicate Jehovah

00:41:19.380 --> 00:41:21.380
to rescue us

00:41:21.380 --> 00:41:24.380
in time of test trial temptation.

00:41:24.380 --> 00:41:26.380
And then,

00:41:26.380 --> 00:41:27.380
we can avail ourselves

00:41:27.380 --> 00:41:29.380
of the help that comes our way,

00:41:29.380 --> 00:41:31.380
in effect reaching out with our right hand

00:41:31.380 --> 00:41:34.380
and grasping Jehovah's right hand.

00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:36.380
But now, let's go to Psalm 145,

00:41:36.380 --> 00:41:38.380
our third example,

00:41:38.380 --> 00:41:41.380
Psalm 145,

00:41:41.380 --> 00:41:44.380
verse number 16 of Jehovah,

00:41:44.380 --> 00:41:45.380
it says,

00:41:45.380 --> 00:41:47.380
you open your hand

00:41:47.380 --> 00:41:50.380
and satisfy the desire

00:41:50.380 --> 00:41:53.380
of every living thing.

00:41:53.380 --> 00:41:55.380
Now, what is this telling us?

00:41:55.380 --> 00:41:57.380
Well, Jehovah can use his hand

00:41:57.380 --> 00:42:00.380
to express tremendous generosity.

00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:01.380
It's true,

00:42:01.380 --> 00:42:03.380
this scripture will be completely fulfilled

00:42:03.380 --> 00:42:04.380
in the New World,

00:42:04.380 --> 00:42:05.380
but even now,

00:42:05.380 --> 00:42:07.380
Jehovah freely uses his hand

00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:09.380
to express generosity.

00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:11.380
He is the most magnanimous giver

00:42:11.380 --> 00:42:13.380
in the universe.

00:42:13.380 --> 00:42:15.380
Nothing stingy

00:42:15.380 --> 00:42:17.380
or tightfisted about Jehovah.

00:42:17.380 --> 00:42:19.380
He gives emotionally,

00:42:19.380 --> 00:42:21.380
he gives materially,

00:42:21.380 --> 00:42:23.380
especially spiritually.

00:42:23.380 --> 00:42:25.380
The ground we walk on,

00:42:25.380 --> 00:42:27.380
the food we eat,

00:42:27.380 --> 00:42:29.380
the air we breathe,

00:42:29.380 --> 00:42:31.380
all come from Jehovah.

00:42:31.380 --> 00:42:33.380
That makes me think of the atheist

00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:34.380
who arrogantly said,

00:42:34.380 --> 00:42:36.380
I don't need God.

00:42:36.380 --> 00:42:38.380
I don't need anybody.

00:42:38.380 --> 00:42:40.380
I don't need anything.

00:42:40.380 --> 00:42:43.380
And then he took a deep breath,

00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:46.380
how short-sighted indeed.

00:42:46.380 --> 00:42:49.380
But now our question is,

00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:51.380
how can we work in harmony

00:42:51.380 --> 00:42:53.380
with this use of Jehovah's hand?

00:42:53.380 --> 00:42:55.380
Well, by being generous toward others,

00:42:55.380 --> 00:42:57.380
being willing to give

00:42:57.380 --> 00:43:00.380
unstentingly of our time,

00:43:00.380 --> 00:43:02.380
energy resources.

00:43:02.380 --> 00:43:04.380
And think about this,

00:43:04.380 --> 00:43:06.380
if we are close-fisted with others,

00:43:06.380 --> 00:43:08.380
not only are we not

00:43:08.380 --> 00:43:10.380
imitating our generous God,

00:43:10.380 --> 00:43:12.380
as beloved children,

00:43:12.380 --> 00:43:14.380
but Jehovah can't put anything

00:43:14.380 --> 00:43:16.380
in our hand.

00:43:16.380 --> 00:43:18.380
On the other hand,

00:43:18.380 --> 00:43:20.380
if we're open-handed,

00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:22.380
with others,

00:43:22.380 --> 00:43:24.380
now Jehovah can't put something

00:43:24.380 --> 00:43:26.380
in our hand.

00:43:26.380 --> 00:43:28.380
Well, let's identify one more way

00:43:28.380 --> 00:43:30.380
Jehovah uses his hand.

00:43:30.380 --> 00:43:32.380
Let's go to Exodus chapter 15,

00:43:32.380 --> 00:43:34.860
please.

00:43:34.860 --> 00:43:36.860
And verse 6,

00:43:36.860 --> 00:43:38.860
the B part.

00:43:38.860 --> 00:43:39.860
Your right hand,

00:43:39.860 --> 00:43:41.860
O Jehovah,

00:43:41.860 --> 00:43:44.860
can shatter an enemy.

00:43:44.860 --> 00:43:46.860
What do we learn?

00:43:46.860 --> 00:43:48.860
He reminds us of how many times

00:43:48.860 --> 00:43:50.860
in the past Jehovah has used his hand

00:43:50.860 --> 00:43:53.860
to smash to irreparable pieces

00:43:53.860 --> 00:43:55.860
his enemies.

00:43:55.860 --> 00:43:56.860
And it assures us

00:43:56.860 --> 00:43:58.860
he will do so

00:43:58.860 --> 00:44:00.860
in an even more all-inspiring way

00:44:00.860 --> 00:44:02.860
in the near future,

00:44:02.860 --> 00:44:04.860
during the Great Tribulation.

00:44:04.860 --> 00:44:06.860
Jehovah will use his hand

00:44:06.860 --> 00:44:09.860
to maneuver many of the wicked,

00:44:09.860 --> 00:44:11.860
to actually use their physical hands

00:44:11.860 --> 00:44:14.860
to slaughter each other.

00:44:14.860 --> 00:44:16.860
And then he will use his hand

00:44:16.860 --> 00:44:18.860
to wheel the forces of nature,

00:44:18.860 --> 00:44:20.860
to use the immortal Christ,

00:44:20.860 --> 00:44:22.860
the immortal 144,000,

00:44:22.860 --> 00:44:24.860
the mighty angels,

00:44:24.860 --> 00:44:26.860
he will use them

00:44:26.860 --> 00:44:28.860
to sweep away,

00:44:28.860 --> 00:44:30.860
sweep out of existence,

00:44:30.860 --> 00:44:32.860
the rest of the wicked,

00:44:32.860 --> 00:44:35.860
along with this entire wicked system.

00:44:35.860 --> 00:44:37.860
How can we work in harmony

00:44:37.860 --> 00:44:39.860
with this use of Jehovah's hand?

00:44:39.860 --> 00:44:41.860
Well, one way, very important,

00:44:41.860 --> 00:44:43.860
we can work hard

00:44:43.860 --> 00:44:44.860
to help people

00:44:44.860 --> 00:44:46.860
take a stand with Jehovah,

00:44:46.860 --> 00:44:47.860
learn the truth,

00:44:47.860 --> 00:44:49.860
so they don't have to be removed

00:44:49.860 --> 00:44:52.860
by Jehovah's all-mighty hand.

00:44:52.860 --> 00:44:54.860
And this brings great delight

00:44:54.860 --> 00:44:56.860
to Jehovah when we do this,

00:44:56.860 --> 00:44:58.860
because Jehovah takes no delight

00:44:58.860 --> 00:45:00.860
and even the death of the wicked.

00:45:00.860 --> 00:45:02.860
But what he takes delight in

00:45:02.860 --> 00:45:04.860
is that someone wicked turns back

00:45:04.860 --> 00:45:05.860
from his way

00:45:05.860 --> 00:45:08.860
and keeps living.

00:45:08.860 --> 00:45:11.860
Well, we have now discussed four ways

00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:14.860
Jehovah can use his all-inspiring hand,

00:45:14.860 --> 00:45:16.860
maneuver government officials,

00:45:16.860 --> 00:45:18.860
according to his will,

00:45:18.860 --> 00:45:20.860
rescue his people,

00:45:20.860 --> 00:45:22.860
give generously,

00:45:22.860 --> 00:45:25.860
shatter his enemies.

00:45:25.860 --> 00:45:27.860
Now, the Bible does describe many other ways

00:45:27.860 --> 00:45:29.860
Jehovah uses his hand,

00:45:29.860 --> 00:45:31.860
so why not make identifying

00:45:31.860 --> 00:45:33.860
some of these other ways

00:45:33.860 --> 00:45:35.860
a future study project?

00:45:35.860 --> 00:45:37.860
I'll give you a little bit of homework.

00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:39.860
But may all of us

00:45:39.860 --> 00:45:41.860
be determined

00:45:41.860 --> 00:45:43.860
to use our physical

00:45:43.860 --> 00:45:45.860
and figurative hand

00:45:45.860 --> 00:45:47.860
to always work in harmony

00:45:47.860 --> 00:45:51.860
with Jehovah's all-inspiring hand.

00:45:51.860 --> 00:45:53.860
Jehovah's hand

00:45:53.860 --> 00:45:55.860
truly is all-inspiring.

00:45:55.860 --> 00:45:59.860
It is done and will do amazing things.

00:45:59.860 --> 00:46:01.860
It will lead us to tranquil waters,

00:46:01.860 --> 00:46:05.860
even if our lives feel like a raging sea.

00:46:05.860 --> 00:46:07.860
This month's music video

00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:09.860
is an uplifting reminder

00:46:09.860 --> 00:46:11.860
of the peace we can have now

00:46:11.860 --> 00:46:14.860
thanks to our shepherd.

00:46:14.860 --> 00:46:17.860
I open my eyes

00:46:17.860 --> 00:46:28.699
to there's nothing to fear

00:46:28.699 --> 00:50:29.030
and everyone is...

00:50:29.030 --> 00:50:31.030
Soon will come the day

00:50:31.030 --> 00:50:33.030
when every one of Jehovah's sheep

00:50:33.030 --> 00:50:35.030
will experience goodness all their days.

00:50:35.030 --> 00:50:37.030
Until then,

00:50:37.030 --> 00:50:39.030
what must we do?

00:50:39.030 --> 00:50:41.030
Stay in the shepherd's warm embrace.

00:50:41.030 --> 00:50:43.030
In his arms,

00:50:43.030 --> 00:50:45.030
he protects us from dangers,

00:50:45.030 --> 00:50:47.030
small and large.

00:50:47.030 --> 00:50:49.030
In his pastures,

00:50:49.030 --> 00:50:51.030
he feeds us nourishing

00:50:51.030 --> 00:50:53.030
spiritual food,

00:50:53.030 --> 00:50:55.030
so we have the strength to make a stand.

00:50:55.030 --> 00:50:57.030
With his hand,

00:50:57.030 --> 00:50:59.030
he gives generously,

00:50:59.030 --> 00:51:01.030
so we lack nothing good.

00:51:01.030 --> 00:51:03.030
Before we conclude,

00:51:03.030 --> 00:51:05.030
let's visit Lichtenstein,

00:51:05.030 --> 00:51:07.030
located between Switzerland

00:51:07.030 --> 00:51:09.030
and Austria.

00:51:09.030 --> 00:51:11.030
It may be long in name,

00:51:11.030 --> 00:51:13.030
but it's small in size.

00:51:13.030 --> 00:51:15.030
As its sixth smallest country

00:51:15.030 --> 00:51:17.030
in the world,

00:51:17.030 --> 00:51:19.030
it has a population of just

00:51:19.030 --> 00:51:21.030
over 39,000 people.

00:51:21.030 --> 00:51:23.030
Despite being flanked

00:51:23.030 --> 00:51:25.030
by snowy mountains on the east

00:51:25.030 --> 00:51:27.030
and south,

00:51:27.030 --> 00:51:29.030
the cities in the valleys below

00:51:29.030 --> 00:51:31.030
enjoy a comfortable climate

00:51:31.030 --> 00:51:33.030
with a warm air called

00:51:33.030 --> 00:51:35.030
Fernwinds,

00:51:35.030 --> 00:51:37.030
flowing downward from the summits.

00:51:37.030 --> 00:51:39.030
If you're interested

00:51:39.030 --> 00:51:41.030
in trekking the rugged terrain,

00:51:41.030 --> 00:51:43.030
be sure to have a hearty meal beforehand.

00:51:43.030 --> 00:51:45.030
You can try Rebel,

00:51:45.030 --> 00:51:47.030
a traditional dish

00:51:47.030 --> 00:51:49.030
made with cornmeal,

00:51:49.030 --> 00:51:51.030
served with applesauce,

00:51:51.030 --> 00:51:53.030
making it a filling and hearty snack.

00:51:53.030 --> 00:51:55.030
The 95 publishers here

00:51:55.030 --> 00:51:57.030
trek the country

00:51:57.030 --> 00:51:59.030
and dispense

00:51:59.030 --> 00:52:01.030
and they also make a small

00:52:01.030 --> 00:52:03.030
journey to Switzerland for their

00:52:03.030 --> 00:52:05.030
meetings.

00:52:05.030 --> 00:52:07.030
The closest kingdom hall is right

00:52:07.030 --> 00:52:09.030
along the border.

00:52:09.030 --> 00:52:11.030
Although most of the population

00:52:11.030 --> 00:52:13.030
is Roman Catholic,

00:52:13.030 --> 00:52:15.030
our brothers still average

00:52:15.030 --> 00:52:17.030
26 Bible studies.

00:52:17.030 --> 00:52:19.030
But the path to preaching

00:52:19.030 --> 00:52:21.030
has not always been smooth.

00:52:21.030 --> 00:52:23.030
Our history of preaching

00:52:23.030 --> 00:52:25.030
is full of uphill battles.

00:52:25.030 --> 00:52:27.030
Starting in the 1920s,

00:52:27.030 --> 00:52:29.030
our literature,

00:52:29.030 --> 00:52:31.030
whether it was from house to house

00:52:31.030 --> 00:52:33.030
or even by letter.

00:52:33.030 --> 00:52:35.030
At one point,

00:52:35.030 --> 00:52:37.030
all the publishers preaching

00:52:37.030 --> 00:52:39.030
in the country were arrested

00:52:39.030 --> 00:52:41.030
and detained on a bus.

00:52:41.030 --> 00:52:43.030
What did they do?

00:52:43.030 --> 00:52:45.030
They sang out to Jehovah,

00:52:45.030 --> 00:52:47.030
undeterred,

00:52:47.030 --> 00:52:49.030
and with dictators rising to power

00:52:49.030 --> 00:52:51.030
in the 1930s,

00:52:51.030 --> 00:52:53.030
they courageously used the pamphlet

00:52:53.030 --> 00:52:55.030
fascism or freedom.

00:52:55.030 --> 00:52:57.030
They were unstoppable.

00:52:57.030 --> 00:52:59.030
Like the warm winds

00:52:59.030 --> 00:53:01.030
blowing in from the mountains,

00:53:01.030 --> 00:53:03.030
the love of our brothers

00:53:03.030 --> 00:53:05.030
and sisters can be felt

00:53:05.030 --> 00:53:07.030
everywhere.

00:53:07.030 --> 00:53:09.030
It's seen in their regular family

00:53:09.030 --> 00:53:11.030
worship evenings,

00:53:11.030 --> 00:53:13.030
before and after the meetings,

00:53:13.030 --> 00:53:15.030
and in their singing to Jehovah.

00:53:15.030 --> 00:53:17.030
And they wish to send that love

00:53:17.030 --> 00:53:19.030
to you, the Worldwide Brotherhood.

00:53:19.030 --> 00:53:21.030
From the World Headquarters

00:53:21.030 --> 00:53:23.030
of Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:25.030
the Worldwide Brotherhood.
