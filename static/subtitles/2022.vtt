00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:06.290
and introduction to the book of Job.

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.289
This book is grouped with four other poetic books,

00:00:09.289 --> 00:00:12.289
and it is among the oldest books in the Bible.

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:19.269
It was completed by Moses about 1473 BCE,

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:24.269
toward the end of the Israelites' 40-year trek in the wilderness.

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.269
The man Job lived in us.

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:29.269
Sham, a forefather of Abraham,

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:33.270
was likely an ancestor of Job as well.

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.270
Even though Job was not an Israelite, he was a worshiper of Jehovah.

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:44.280
Job was very wealthy.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.280
He had many servants and owned thousands of sheep, camels, and other livestock.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.280
He and his wife had ten children, and he was highly respected in his community.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:03.280
However, all of this was lost because of a series of tragic events.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.280
At the time Job's trials took place,

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.280
Jehovah said that there was no one like Job on the earth.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:16.280
Therefore, we can place these events after the death of the faithful man Joseph,

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.280
but before Moses became leader over Israel.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.280
The book of Job contains 42 chapters.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.280
Chapters 1 and 2 reveal events that took place in the heavens.

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:37.280
Satan challenged Jehovah and claimed that Job would not remain faithful when faced with adversity.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:44.280
Chapters 3 to 31 contained several rounds of debates between Job and his three companions,

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.280
Ella Faz, Bill Dad, and so far.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:55.280
Ella Faz ridiculed Job's integrity and implied that man is useless to God.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:01.280
Bill Dad suggested that Job was suffering as punishment for his sins.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.280
So far, harshly insinuated that Job was wicked.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.280
Job attempted to defend himself from these accusations,

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:16.280
but in doing so, he made incorrect statements about Jehovah.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:23.280
In Chapters 32 to 37, after listening to a Job and his companions had to say,

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.280
the young man Ella who offers wise counsel.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:34.280
Then in Chapters 38 to 41, Jehovah, speaking out of a windstorm,

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.280
corrects Job's thinking with thought-provoking questions about creation.

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.419
Did you know?

00:02:42.419 --> 00:02:47.419
The book of Job describes the earth as suspended upon nothing,

00:02:47.419 --> 00:02:51.419
a fact that was not widely recognized until centuries later.

00:02:51.419 --> 00:02:59.090
In the final chapter, God commands Job's three companions to offer a sacrifice

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:04.090
and tells them that Job will pray in their behalf.

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.090
Jehovah then restored Job's health and reputation,

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:14.090
gave him double the wealth he had before, blessed him with seven more sons and three more daughters,

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:20.090
and allowed him to live for an additional 140 years.

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.090
As you read this book, pay attention to how this account proves

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.090
that Jehovah is not the cause of human suffering.

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:34.090
How events in the heavens help us to understand the issue of universal sovereignty,

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:40.090
and how the outcome of Job's trials gives us a glimpse of future Kingdom blessings

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.090
for those who remain loyal to Jehovah.
