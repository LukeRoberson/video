00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:08.779
On May 6th, just a few short months ago, the Bethel family had the pleasure of being introduced to you.

00:00:08.779 --> 00:00:22.780
The 156th class of Gilead, and it was heartwarming for us to hear each of you share with us sincere expressions of gratitude for the opportunity to come to Gilead.

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:26.780
It's always refreshing, isn't it, to hear someone say thank you?

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:34.780
Yet the Bible very frankly describes a number who displayed a callous spirit of ingratitude.

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.780
For most of these of course was Jehovah's chief adversary.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:50.780
The Watchtower 2005, the October 15th issue says, instead of being grateful, Satan became puffed up with pride and began to despise God's way of ruling.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.780
And then there's our first parents, Adam and Eve.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:06.780
Similarly, the Watchtower of 2000, the November 15th issue said, most individuals flatly refused to serve God, their spirit is one of, in gratitude.

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.780
Satan enticed Adam and Eve into such a way of thinking, end of quote.

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:21.780
Why did these perfect individuals make the decisions they did? They failed to cultivate a grateful heart.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:30.780
The Bible encourages us to do that. In 1 Thessalonians 5-18, give thanks for everything that is God's will for you.

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.780
Colossians 3-15, show yourselves thankful.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:41.780
Psalm 92-1, it is good to give thanks to Jehovah.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:49.780
And to cultivate refers to the preparation of the soil before planting and then nurturing the resulting crop.

00:01:49.780 --> 00:02:03.780
Interestingly, the nation of Israel was told to leave their fields follow, uncultivated every seven years, to allow the soil to regenerate to regain its vitality.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:14.780
But the soil of our heart is very different, isn't it? It's always fertile. Something is always growing there. It must never lie, follow.

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:23.780
If we complacently allow gratitude to wither, what will grow in the untended soil of our heart?

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:33.780
Weeds of selfish ingratitude. That's what happened to Israel as a nation despite the warning Moses gave to them.

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:52.780
In Deuteronomy chapter 6 and in chapter 8, Moses said, when Jehovah your God brings you into the land he swore to your forefathers, when you have eaten and become satisfied and have an abundance of everything, be careful not to forget Jehovah your God.

00:02:52.780 --> 00:03:03.780
Jehovah knew they had a tendency, a disposition to take for granted what he had given to them, to forget what he had done for them despite his efforts to remind them.

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:13.780
Sadly, as Psalm 106-13-21 says, they quickly forgot what he did, they forgot God their Savior.

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:20.780
Now it's easy for us today to look back and shake our heads and disapprove of the whole of Israel was so ungrateful.

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:29.780
But isn't it true we have the same inclination sometimes to forget what Jehovah has done for us, to take for granted what he has done for us?

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:38.780
So we begin to see that there's this close relationship, this interaction between gratitude and memory.

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:49.780
To cultivate a grateful heart we do that by remembering, reflecting, recalling, recounting with appreciation what Jehovah has done for us.

00:03:49.780 --> 00:04:01.780
Now certainly that includes what is done for us as a people collectively, but your gratitude is something very personal between you and your father.

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.780
What has Jehovah done for you?

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.780
Now the Psalmist recognized the need to cultivate this type of gratitude.

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.780
Look please at Psalm 143 and verse number 5.

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.779
The Psalmist says, I remember the days of old.

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:27.779
I meditate on all your activity. I eagerly ponder over the work of your hands.

00:04:27.779 --> 00:04:36.779
Well we follow that good example by regularly taking the time to reflect on the many things for which we're grateful, even physically listing them.

00:04:36.779 --> 00:04:43.779
That's not a meaningless simplistic exercise as we see our lists grow longer and longer, what happens?

00:04:43.779 --> 00:04:51.779
Well a seed is planted, appreciation takes root, gratitude flourishes.

00:04:51.779 --> 00:05:02.779
On June 25th of this year our dear sister, Julia Globa, was convicted by a Russian court and sentenced to a suspended prison sentence.

00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:11.779
As she writes, every evening I make a list of things that I experience that day, blessings.

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:16.779
Then I take time to thank Jehovah for these expressions of his love.

00:05:16.779 --> 00:05:20.779
After all, why do we use lists? Isn't it so we don't forget?

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:26.779
We got all kinds of lists, guests list and to-do list and punch list and shopping list.

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:30.779
We've got bucket lists, wish lists.

00:05:30.779 --> 00:05:33.779
How do we decide what goes on our list?

00:05:33.779 --> 00:05:36.779
Well we do a sort of mental inventory, don't we?

00:05:36.779 --> 00:05:41.779
Or we may physically look in the refrigerator, look in our kitchen pantry.

00:05:41.779 --> 00:05:44.779
We do an inspection of our kingdom hall.

00:05:44.779 --> 00:05:47.779
The shopping won't get done by itself.

00:05:47.779 --> 00:05:50.779
The kingdom hall won't get fixed by itself.

00:05:50.779 --> 00:05:54.779
Our heart will not become grateful by itself.

00:05:54.779 --> 00:05:58.779
We must search the pantry of our personal experiences.

00:05:58.779 --> 00:06:04.779
And when we do what we find there, what many obvious things, we're grateful for life.

00:06:04.779 --> 00:06:10.779
We're grateful for having a measure of health, for being drawn into Jehovah's organization.

00:06:10.779 --> 00:06:16.779
We're grateful for our faithful, a governing body, for our rich spiritual food, our hope for the future,

00:06:16.779 --> 00:06:21.779
our original songs. The list can become quite substantial, won't it?

00:06:21.779 --> 00:06:30.779
And the longer we linger in this grateful mindset, other less obvious things may find their way on our list.

00:06:30.779 --> 00:06:34.779
For instance, are we grateful for God's laws?

00:06:34.779 --> 00:06:38.779
You know our youngsters enjoy roller coasters.

00:06:38.779 --> 00:06:45.779
And instead of clutching the bar, we often see them with their arms up in the air to increase the thrill of the ride.

00:06:45.779 --> 00:06:48.779
Why are they so confident?

00:06:48.779 --> 00:06:55.779
Well, they know that they're securely anchored in their seat by reliable safety device, our harness.

00:06:55.779 --> 00:07:01.779
What I think you'll agree that our lives in this system are much like roller coasters.

00:07:01.779 --> 00:07:08.779
With many unexpected, unanticipated, and disconcerting twists and turns.

00:07:08.779 --> 00:07:16.779
But because we're firmly anchored by the reliable standards and direction from God's word,

00:07:16.779 --> 00:07:19.779
we feel free to in effect enjoy the ride.

00:07:19.779 --> 00:07:24.779
We feel confident that whatever we encounter, Jehovah is going to guide us safely through.

00:07:24.779 --> 00:07:28.779
Yes, we're grateful for God's laws.

00:07:28.779 --> 00:07:33.779
Now, what about counsel, correction, even discipline?

00:07:33.779 --> 00:07:35.779
Are we grateful for that?

00:07:35.779 --> 00:07:42.779
Well, it's true Hebrews 12-11 says that no discipline seems for the present to be joyous, but it is painful.

00:07:42.779 --> 00:07:46.779
But remember what Psalm 141-5 says.

00:07:46.779 --> 00:07:48.779
Should the righteous one strike me?

00:07:48.779 --> 00:07:50.779
It would be an act of loyal love.

00:07:50.779 --> 00:07:59.779
Should he approve me, it would be like oil on my head, refreshing and curative, which my head would never refuse.

00:07:59.779 --> 00:08:09.060
When I was a young teenager, I got into the bad habit of using big words when I would comment at the congregation watchtower study.

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:15.060
I was showing off until my big brother, gently elbowed me.

00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:21.060
And without a word, he pointed in his Bible to 1 Corinthians 149.

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:24.060
Now, you remember what that says, right?

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:31.060
It says, unless you use speech easily understood, how will anyone know what is being said?

00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:34.059
You will be speaking to the air.

00:08:34.059 --> 00:08:39.059
Well, I don't mind telling you that that scriptural counsel stung a little bit.

00:08:39.059 --> 00:08:42.059
And like we often do, I found fault with a counselor.

00:08:42.059 --> 00:08:47.059
I remember saying to myself, well, you're not a dad, you're just my brother.

00:08:47.059 --> 00:08:51.059
But here I am 50 years later, I still remember the counsel.

00:08:51.059 --> 00:08:53.059
I'm still trying to apply it.

00:08:53.059 --> 00:08:57.059
It's a gift, a counsel, a correction.

00:08:57.059 --> 00:09:02.059
Even discipline, we're truly welcome for a well-deserved direction.

00:09:02.059 --> 00:09:07.059
As we reflect on the innumerable reasons we have to be thankful,

00:09:07.059 --> 00:09:11.059
well, we're moved to respond as the Psalmist did.

00:09:11.059 --> 00:09:13.059
Psalm 116-12.

00:09:13.059 --> 00:09:20.059
With what will I repay Jehovah for all the good he's done for me?

00:09:20.059 --> 00:09:26.059
Of course, our foremost reason, our motive for cultivating a grateful heart,

00:09:26.059 --> 00:09:28.059
is to imitate our Father.

00:09:28.059 --> 00:09:31.059
Jehovah has a grateful heart.

00:09:31.059 --> 00:09:33.059
How do we know?

00:09:33.059 --> 00:09:37.059
Well, remember that gratitude is linked to memory.

00:09:37.059 --> 00:09:43.059
And Hebrews 6 and verse 10 assures us that Jehovah is not unrighteous so as to forget

00:09:43.059 --> 00:09:47.059
your work and the love you showed for his name.

00:09:47.059 --> 00:09:51.059
So Jehovah is grateful for your hard work.

00:09:51.059 --> 00:09:54.059
He's grateful that you came to Gilead.

00:09:54.059 --> 00:10:01.059
He is going to, as a result of his gratitude, reward you in ways that are unimaginable.

00:10:02.059 --> 00:10:06.059
To faithful Israelites, he promised in Deuteronomy 282,

00:10:06.059 --> 00:10:14.059
all these blessings will come upon you and overtake you because you keep listening to the voice of Jehovah your God.

00:10:14.059 --> 00:10:17.059
And to me, this is an intriguing choice of words.

00:10:17.059 --> 00:10:19.059
What does it mean to overtake?

00:10:19.059 --> 00:10:21.059
The definition?

00:10:21.059 --> 00:10:25.059
Catch up with and pass while traveling in the same direction.

00:10:25.059 --> 00:10:27.059
So think about what Jehovah is telling us.

00:10:27.059 --> 00:10:35.059
Even if a person for some inexplicable reason would try to avoid, to outrun, to evade Jehovah's blessing,

00:10:35.059 --> 00:10:37.059
he would not be able.

00:10:37.059 --> 00:10:40.059
Jehovah's blessing would always overtake him.

00:10:40.059 --> 00:10:46.059
So you can be confident that as you continue to travel in the same direction with Jehovah,

00:10:46.059 --> 00:10:51.059
as you'll draw close to him, he in turn is going to draw close to you.

00:10:51.059 --> 00:10:55.059
He's going to richly bless you and why?

00:10:55.059 --> 00:10:58.059
Because you cultivate a grateful heart.
