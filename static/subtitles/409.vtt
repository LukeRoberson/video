00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:08.609
In a recent poll, over 6,000 people surveyed worldwide were asked to rank what they felt

00:00:08.609 --> 00:00:10.769
were keys to happiness.

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:18.250
Now, interest was that only 16% believed that one's faith or religious beliefs had any

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.050
impact or bearing on their personal happiness.

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:28.370
Now, the words of today's text, as we know, are part of Jesus' sermon on the Mount.

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:34.770
And he begins this by letting us know what is needed in order to be truly happy.

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.450
But in his discussion, Jesus explained something quite different from that poll.

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:46.490
He explains that our happiness is directly connected to our faith and to our relationship

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:48.329
with God.

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.250
I invite you to turn with me in your Bibles.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:59.020
We're going to consider portions of this account to Matthew chapter 5.

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:06.739
And let's begin with the reading of Matthew chapter 5 verse 3.

00:01:06.739 --> 00:01:12.500
Happy are those conscious of their spiritual need since the kingdom of the heavens belongs

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.859
to them.

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:16.260
Notice the start.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:23.540
Happy are those conscious of their spiritual need, or as the footnote says, or those who

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.980
are beggars for the Spirit.

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:34.859
A literal beggar is likely painfully aware of his need for physical food.

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:39.299
And isn't that exactly how you and I have to be conscious of our spiritual need?

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.260
You see, we have to beg Jehovah for his Holy Spirit.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.219
And you notice this point is highlighted again.

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:53.180
If you look in verse 6, the thought of hungering and thirsting for divine guidance, begging to

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.620
be led in the right way to allow Jehovah Spirit to be operative upon us.

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.739
And in our lives.

00:01:59.739 --> 00:02:03.900
And of course, we do this by taking advantage of spiritual provisions.

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.979
So reading and meditating on God's Word, having a regular study program.

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.259
And of course, constantly going to Jehovah in prayer.

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:19.780
When we do this, all of this shows that we are putting our complete dependence and reliance

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.139
upon Jehovah.

00:02:22.139 --> 00:02:27.580
And of course, as we beg for Holy Spirit, and we work to apply the things that we learn

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.620
well, obviously now we're happy because it helps us to become better individuals.

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.419
And we're better able to display various aspects of the fruitage of the Spirit.

00:02:38.419 --> 00:02:41.500
And this becomes evident in our dealings with others.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.740
Jesus mentioned some of these qualities in His sermon.

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:49.219
For example, you look in verse 5, we develop the quality of mildness.

00:02:49.219 --> 00:02:53.979
Verse 7, we're able to be merciful with others.

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:59.699
And in verse 9, we're peaceable or we're peace makers.

00:02:59.699 --> 00:03:05.419
So we're the ones that go about working to initiate peace with one another.

00:03:05.419 --> 00:03:09.060
And being in such a large family certainly can't we see the benefit of this.

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.580
The more that we're able to integrate these qualities into our dealings with one another,

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.780
the happier we're going to be.

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.979
And of course, the happier our Bethel family will be as they deal with one another.

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:25.740
Our next concern is our text for today, verse 8.

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:30.860
And here in verse 8, we're helped to examine our motives for serving God.

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:35.939
As our commenters mentioned, being pure and hard has to do with what we are on the inside.

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:41.500
So it's our motives, it's our affections, it's our desires.

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:47.060
And can't we say, aren't we happiest when we know that we're serving Jehovah with a clean conscience

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:53.860
and that everything that we do is motivated by our sincere love and gratitude for Him?

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.699
You know, the interesting thing about Jesus' terminal of the mount was that as he spoke

00:03:57.699 --> 00:04:02.460
with these large crowds that gathered from all over,

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:07.939
likely the majority of the people in the crowds were happy.

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:11.939
They were probably very excited, they were able to make this journey.

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:16.860
They were thrilled about the possibility of beating Jesus and learning about Him,

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:22.899
but many of them had probably been healed by Him and cured of some sickness and infirmity.

00:04:22.899 --> 00:04:29.779
But despite all of that joy and excitement, Jesus was helping them to see that real happiness,

00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:37.579
genuine happiness, was more than how they felt or what they were doing at present.

00:04:37.579 --> 00:04:43.139
Happiness was not just a joyous occasion, it was more than just a good time with others.

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:45.259
It went much deeper than that.

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:51.379
It involved their contentment, satisfaction, fulfillment, and life.

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:56.939
And all of those things are directly related to one's relationship with God.

00:04:56.939 --> 00:05:02.660
That's why if we go back to chapter 6, even if you look in verses 10 and 11,

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:10.699
it's amazing how members of our brotherhood can experience hurt, disappointment, ridicule,

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:16.579
even severe persecution, and yet they're able to remain remarkably happy.

00:05:16.579 --> 00:05:18.180
Why?

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:23.660
It's because of their relationship and service to Jehovah.

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:28.019
Now, this sermon on the Mount was not the only time that Jesus focuses on this point.

00:05:28.019 --> 00:05:33.300
If we look at another account, if you turn with me please to Luke chapter 11.

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:38.300
And here we'll see another account where Jesus shows the connection between happiness

00:05:38.339 --> 00:05:40.660
and one's relationship with Jehovah.

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:48.689
Luke chapter 11, and we'll look at verse 27.

00:05:48.689 --> 00:05:52.850
Jesus now, as he was saying these things, a woman from the crowd called out to him,

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:58.329
happy is the wound that carried you and the breasts that nursed you.

00:05:58.329 --> 00:06:03.769
But Jewish women desire the privilege of being the mother of a prophet and particularly the Messiah.

00:06:03.769 --> 00:06:08.490
So this woman must have thought, what a privilege for Mary.

00:06:08.529 --> 00:06:14.250
How happy she must have been to be the mother of Jesus Christ.

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:16.529
And likely she was.

00:06:16.529 --> 00:06:19.089
But yet, what did Jesus do?

00:06:19.089 --> 00:06:26.810
Notice how he gently corrects the woman and directs her attention as to the true source of happiness.

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:28.850
Verse 28.

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:38.209
But he said, no, rather, happy are those hearing the word of God and keeping it.

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:44.769
So again, Jesus emphasizes that true happiness is not found in any physical ties.

00:06:44.769 --> 00:06:46.529
It's not found in privileges.

00:06:46.529 --> 00:06:49.209
It's not found in accomplishments.

00:06:49.209 --> 00:06:55.250
True happiness is found in being a true faithful servant of God.

00:06:55.250 --> 00:07:00.529
Because likely Jesus knew if we were to gauge our happiness on any of these other things,

00:07:00.529 --> 00:07:05.610
you see, our life becomes one giant rollercoaster of events.

00:07:05.649 --> 00:07:12.329
It's basically a bunch of highs and lows and we're just waiting for the next big thing in life to make us happy.

00:07:12.329 --> 00:07:14.569
That's a very tough way to live.

00:07:14.569 --> 00:07:16.930
It's a stressful way to live.

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:21.290
Well, Jesus and his father, they don't want us to live this way.

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:26.009
How interesting our watchtower for this week really helped to capture this point.

00:07:26.009 --> 00:07:33.529
And didn't we learn that we cannot gauge happiness by what we have, by what we do,

00:07:33.529 --> 00:07:36.009
even by where we serve?

00:07:36.009 --> 00:07:36.930
Because isn't it true?

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:41.250
The reality is there are some things that are just not in our control.

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:46.449
And as our watchtower so nicely highlighted, our circumstances can always change.

00:07:46.449 --> 00:07:53.850
And that's going to affect, expand, or limit what we're able to do in Jehovah's service.

00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:58.089
If we just go back for a minute to that survey that was taken.

00:07:58.129 --> 00:08:06.889
The top answer on the list is to far as what made one happy was family and relationships.

00:08:06.889 --> 00:08:15.689
And doesn't that really highlight the disconnect when a person does not view Jehovah as family?

00:08:15.689 --> 00:08:19.370
When they don't see him as their heavenly father.

00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:25.410
So don't we rejoice in the fact we cherish the fact that actually that Jehovah is our father.

00:08:25.449 --> 00:08:27.250
And he's a happy God.

00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:30.129
And he wants us to be happy as well.

00:08:30.129 --> 00:08:34.490
Jehovah is certainly appreciative of anything that we're able to do in his service

00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:37.289
according to our circumstances and our abilities.

00:08:37.289 --> 00:08:41.090
And we rejoice in the fact that our faith is strong.

00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:45.769
And we are happy genuinely happy.

00:08:45.769 --> 00:08:46.769
Why?

00:08:46.769 --> 00:08:49.730
Because we have a good relationship with God.

00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:53.250
And this is a relationship that allows us to learn about him.

00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:57.649
That allows us to be fellow workers with him in our Christian ministry.

00:08:57.649 --> 00:09:04.129
And ultimately gives us the tremendous privilege to bear and to carry his name.
