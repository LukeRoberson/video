00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:19.289
It's hard to face this life with all we see

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:25.699
To not focus on the uncertainty

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:32.899
And if she starts at times we all may feel

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:39.700
But when we pray, his promise is real

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:47.509
He gives us peace like a river

00:00:47.509 --> 00:00:54.320
He's like a cool general

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:02.729
Reticarious dance drum

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:14.299
His peace will flow forever

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:18.299
Yes peace like a river

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:35.560
So pour out your heart to him in prayer

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.060
You hold us listening

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.060
He's always there

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:49.299
Comfort us in God our heart and mine

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:53.810
I'm failing love from him

00:01:53.810 --> 00:02:03.439
He gives us peace like a river

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:11.139
He's like a cool general

00:02:11.139 --> 00:02:19.539
Reticarious dance drum

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:31.020
His peace will flow forever

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.020
Yes peace like a river

00:02:35.020 --> 00:03:08.509
He's like a river

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:15.439
He's like a core

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:24.340
Reticarious dance drum

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:35.939
His peace will flow forever

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:40.340
Yes peace like a river
