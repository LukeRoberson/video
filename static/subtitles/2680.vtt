00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:21.879
In the 15th year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar,

00:00:21.879 --> 00:00:25.960
when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea,

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.879
Herod was district ruler of Galilee.

00:00:29.879 --> 00:00:31.879
Philip, his brother, was district ruler

00:00:31.879 --> 00:00:36.469
of the country of Iteria and Trachonitis,

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:44.299
and Lysanius was district ruler of Abelene

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:50.460
in the days of chief priest Annus and of Caeophus.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.619
God's declaration came to John,

00:00:55.859 --> 00:01:03.280
the son of Zechariah, the wilderness.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.040
This man came as a witness

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:15.310
in order to bear witness about the light

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.790
so that people of all sorts

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.140
might believe through him.

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.670
He was not that light,

00:01:26.670 --> 00:02:36.139
but he was meant to bear witness about that light.

00:02:36.139 --> 00:02:40.340
In those days,

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.020
John the Baptist came preaching

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.949
in the wilderness of Judea.

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:55.439
Repent for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:13.520
So he went into all the country around the Jordan,

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.719
preaching baptism in symbol of repentance

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:26.419
for forgiveness of sins.

00:03:26.419 --> 00:03:28.099
Just as it is written in the book

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:32.289
of the words of Isaiah the prophet,

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:35.409
a voice of one crying out in the wilderness,

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:38.810
prepare the way of Jehovah,

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:45.509
make his roads straight,

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:49.580
every valley must be filled up,

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:54.860
and every mountain and hill leveled.

00:03:54.860 --> 00:04:00.219
The crooked ways must become straight

00:04:00.219 --> 00:04:14.930
and the rough ways smooth,

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:16.970
and all flesh will see

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:33.129
the salvation of God.

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:36.569
Now John was clothed with camel's air

00:04:36.649 --> 00:04:39.730
and had a leather belt around his waist.

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:56.750
His food was locusts and wild honey

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:00.670
then the people of Jerusalem and all Judea

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:03.230
and all the country around the Jordan

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:12.300
were going out to him

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.620
and they were baptized by him in the Jordan River.

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:37.730
Openly confessing their sins

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:40.529
when he caught sight of many of the Pharisees

00:05:40.529 --> 00:05:47.740
and Sadducees coming to the baptism.

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:48.740
He said to them,

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:51.740
You offspring of vipers

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:57.399
who has warned you to flee from the coming wrath.

00:05:59.399 --> 00:06:10.819
Therefore, produce fruit that befits repentance,

00:06:10.819 --> 00:06:13.819
do not presume to say to yourselves,

00:06:13.819 --> 00:06:15.819
we have Abraham as our Father.

00:06:15.819 --> 00:06:20.259
For I say to you,

00:06:20.259 --> 00:06:24.259
that God is able to raise up children for Abraham

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:26.259
from these stones.

00:06:28.629 --> 00:06:34.939
The axe is already lying at the root of the trees,

00:06:34.939 --> 00:06:38.699
every tree then that does not produce fine fruit.

00:06:40.300 --> 00:07:20.160
It's to be cut down and thrown into the fire

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:21.839
and the crowns were asking him,

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:24.879
what then should we do?

00:07:26.639 --> 00:07:30.879
Let the man who has two garments share with the man who has none

00:07:31.879 --> 00:07:34.240
and let the one who has something to eat do the same.

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:38.240
Even tax collectors came to be baptized.

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:40.240
Teacher!

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:42.240
What should we do?

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:56.379
Do not demand anything more than the tax rate.

00:07:56.379 --> 00:08:02.420
Also, those in military service were asking him,

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:07.740
what should we do to not harass anybody

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:09.740
or accuse anybody falsely

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:14.269
but be satisfied with your provisions?

00:08:14.269 --> 00:08:19.000
Now the people were in expectation

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
and all of them were reasoning in their hearts about John.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.730
May he perhaps be the Christ?

00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:32.730
John gave the answer, saying to all,

00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:34.730
I, for my part,

00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:38.899
baptized you with the water

00:08:38.899 --> 00:08:40.899
that the one stronger than I am is coming,

00:08:40.899 --> 00:08:44.899
the less of whose sandals I am not worthy to one die.

00:08:44.899 --> 00:08:47.899
He will baptize you with holy spirit

00:08:47.899 --> 00:08:49.899
and with fire,

00:08:49.899 --> 00:08:51.899
his winnowing shovel is in his hand

00:08:51.899 --> 00:08:55.899
to clean up his dressing floor completely,

00:08:55.899 --> 00:08:59.899
and together the wheat into his stoy else.

00:08:59.899 --> 00:09:05.580
But the chaff,

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:38.600
he will burn up with fire that cannot be put out.

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:41.600
He also gave many other exhortations

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:47.009
and continued declaring good news to the people.

00:09:47.009 --> 00:11:50.590
Then Jesus came from Galilee

00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:56.759
to the Jordan to John

00:11:56.759 --> 00:11:58.759
in order to be baptized by him.

00:11:58.759 --> 00:12:06.120
But the latter tried to prevent him.

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:11.610
I'm the one who needs to be baptized by you.

00:12:11.610 --> 00:12:15.019
Are you coming to me?

00:12:15.019 --> 00:12:21.370
Let it be this time.

00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:24.370
For in that way, it is suitable for us

00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:26.370
to carry out all that is righteous.

00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:35.340
Then he quit preventing him,

00:12:35.340 --> 00:13:22.440
after being baptized.

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:25.440
Jesus immediately came up from the water.

00:13:25.440 --> 00:14:07.730
Heavens were opened up

00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:13.490
and he saw God's spirit descending

00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:16.490
like a dove

00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:24.440
and coming upon him.

00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:29.440
Also, a voice from the heavens said,

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:32.440
This is my son,

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:35.440
the beloved whom I have...

00:14:35.440 --> 00:15:21.990
And immediately,

00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:23.990
the spirit impelled him

00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:25.990
to go into the wilderness

00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:37.429
so he continued in the wilderness for forty days,

00:15:37.429 --> 00:15:40.429
being tempted by Satan.

00:15:40.429 --> 00:15:43.429
He was with the wild beasts.

00:15:43.429 --> 00:15:53.840
But the angels were ministering to him.

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:57.220
When Jesus began his work,

00:15:57.220 --> 00:15:59.220
he was about thirty years old,

00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:03.840
being the son,

00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:05.840
as the opinion was,

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:07.840
of Joseph,

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:10.840

00:20:24.339 --> 00:20:29.819
son of Adam,

00:20:29.819 --> 00:20:52.460
of God.

00:20:52.460 --> 00:21:10.170
After he had fasted,

00:21:10.170 --> 00:21:12.170
for forty days,

00:21:12.170 --> 00:21:17.180
and forty nights,

00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:18.180
he felt hungry,

00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:46.289
the tempter approached.

00:21:46.289 --> 00:21:55.240
If you are son of God,

00:21:55.240 --> 00:22:01.950
tell these stones,

00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:03.950
to become loaves of bread,

00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:12.539
it is written,

00:22:12.539 --> 00:22:14.539
man must live not on bread alone,

00:22:14.539 --> 00:22:21.440
but on every word that comes

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:43.500
from Jehovah's mouth.

00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:44.500
Then the devil took him along

00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:46.500
into the holy city,

00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:47.500
and he stationed him

00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:49.500
on the battlement of the temple,

00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:52.500
and said to him,

00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:56.500
If you are a son of God,

00:22:56.500 --> 00:23:01.359
throw yourself down,

00:23:01.359 --> 00:23:04.359
for it is written,

00:23:04.359 --> 00:23:06.359
he will give his angels

00:23:06.359 --> 00:23:09.359
a command concerning you,

00:23:09.359 --> 00:23:12.359
and they will carry you on their hands,

00:23:12.359 --> 00:23:15.359
so that you may not strike your foot

00:23:15.359 --> 00:23:17.359
against the stones.

00:23:17.359 --> 00:23:20.359
Again, it is written,

00:23:20.359 --> 00:23:22.359
you must not put Jehovah

00:23:22.359 --> 00:23:42.119
your God to the test.

00:23:42.119 --> 00:23:46.009
So he brought him up,

00:23:46.009 --> 00:23:48.009
and showed him all the kingdoms

00:23:48.009 --> 00:23:50.009
of the inhabited earth,

00:23:50.009 --> 00:24:09.549
in an instant of time.

00:24:09.549 --> 00:24:12.549
Then the devil said to him,

00:24:12.549 --> 00:24:16.549
I will give you all this authority,

00:24:16.549 --> 00:24:21.059
and their glory,

00:24:21.059 --> 00:24:26.559
because it has been handed over to me,

00:24:26.559 --> 00:24:30.559
and I give it to whoever I wish,

00:24:30.559 --> 00:24:38.099
if you therefore,

00:24:38.099 --> 00:24:41.099
do an act of worship,

00:24:41.099 --> 00:24:43.099
before me,

00:24:43.099 --> 00:24:46.740
it will all be yours.

00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:48.740
Go away, Satan,

00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:50.740
for it is written,

00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:52.740
it is Jehovah your God,

00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:53.740
you must worship,

00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:55.740
and it is to him alone,

00:24:55.740 --> 00:25:02.380
you must render sacred service.

00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:04.380
Then,

00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:31.619
the devil left him.

00:25:31.619 --> 00:25:32.619
Angels came,

00:25:43.119 --> 00:25:45.119
and began to minister to him.

00:25:45.119 --> 00:27:30.059
This is the witness John gave,

00:27:30.059 --> 00:27:32.059
when the Jews sent priests

00:27:32.059 --> 00:27:34.059
and Levites from Jerusalem

00:27:34.059 --> 00:27:40.599
to ask him,

00:27:40.599 --> 00:27:42.599
Who are you?

00:27:42.599 --> 00:27:44.599
And he admitted it,

00:27:44.599 --> 00:27:46.599
and did not deny it.

00:27:46.599 --> 00:27:48.599
I am not the Christ.

00:27:48.599 --> 00:27:50.599
What then?

00:27:50.599 --> 00:27:52.599
Are you Elijah?

00:27:52.599 --> 00:27:56.579
I am not.

00:27:56.579 --> 00:27:58.579
Are you the prophet?

00:27:58.579 --> 00:28:00.579
No.

00:28:00.579 --> 00:28:03.579
Who are you?

00:28:03.579 --> 00:28:04.579
Tell us,

00:28:04.579 --> 00:28:07.579
so that we may give an answer to those who sent us.

00:28:07.579 --> 00:28:19.700
What do you say about yourself?

00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:23.339
I am a voice,

00:28:24.339 --> 00:28:27.339
of someone crying out in the wilderness,

00:28:27.339 --> 00:28:30.339
make the way of Jehovah's straight,

00:28:30.339 --> 00:28:33.339
just as Isaiah the prophet said.

00:28:33.339 --> 00:28:37.339
Now those sent were from the Pharisees,

00:28:37.339 --> 00:28:40.339
so they questioned him.

00:28:40.339 --> 00:28:42.339
Why then do you baptize,

00:28:42.339 --> 00:28:46.339
if you are not the Christ or Elijah or the prophet?

00:28:46.339 --> 00:28:49.339
I baptize in water,

00:28:49.339 --> 00:28:51.339
understanding among you,

00:28:51.339 --> 00:28:53.339
not know,

00:28:53.339 --> 00:28:55.339
the one coming behind me,

00:28:55.339 --> 00:29:01.019
the lace of whose sandal,

00:29:01.019 --> 00:29:03.019
I am not worthy to untie.

00:29:03.019 --> 00:29:27.690
These things took place in Bethany across the Jordan,

00:29:27.690 --> 00:29:32.920
where John was baptizing.

00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:54.940
The next day, he saw Jesus coming toward him.

00:29:54.940 --> 00:30:07.829
See, the Lamb of God,

00:30:07.829 --> 00:30:13.200
who takes away the sin of the world.

00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:15.200
This is the one,

00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:17.200
about whom I said behind me,

00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:20.200
as a man was advanced in front of me,

00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:22.200
for he existed before me.

00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:25.200
Even I did not know him,

00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:28.200
but the reason why I came baptizing in water

00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:32.509
was so that he might be made manifest to Israel.

00:30:32.509 --> 00:30:35.509
I viewed the Spirit coming down as a dove,

00:30:35.509 --> 00:30:37.509
out of heaven,

00:30:37.509 --> 00:30:40.509
and it remained upon him.

00:30:40.509 --> 00:30:42.509
Even I did not know him,

00:30:42.509 --> 00:30:45.509
but the very one who sent me to baptizing water said to me,

00:30:45.509 --> 00:30:49.509
whoever it is upon whom you see the Spirit coming down and remaining.

00:30:49.509 --> 00:30:51.509
This is the one,

00:30:51.509 --> 00:30:54.509
who baptizes in Holy Spirit.

00:30:54.509 --> 00:30:57.509
And I have seen it,

00:30:57.509 --> 00:30:59.509
and I've given witness,

00:30:59.509 --> 00:31:21.460
that this one is the Son of God.

00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:25.380
Again, the next day,

00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:32.089
John was standing with two of his disciples,

00:31:32.089 --> 00:31:34.089
and as he looked at Jesus walking,

00:31:34.089 --> 00:31:36.089
he said,

00:31:36.089 --> 00:31:39.089
See, the Lamb of God,

00:31:39.089 --> 00:31:46.309
when the two disciples heard him say this,

00:31:46.309 --> 00:31:49.910
they followed Jesus,

00:31:49.910 --> 00:32:10.730
then Jesus turned,

00:32:10.730 --> 00:32:12.730
and seeing them following,

00:32:12.730 --> 00:32:14.730
he said to them,

00:32:14.730 --> 00:32:17.730
What are you looking for?

00:32:17.730 --> 00:32:25.400
Rabbi, where are you staying?

00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:27.400
Come, and you'll see.

00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:32.940
So they went,

00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:34.940
and saw where he was staying,

00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:37.940
and they stayed with him that day.

00:32:37.940 --> 00:32:39.940
It was about the tenth hour.

00:32:39.940 --> 00:32:44.740
Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter,

00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:47.740
was one of the two who heard what John said,

00:32:47.740 --> 00:32:54.309
and followed Jesus.

00:32:54.309 --> 00:32:59.329
He first found his own brother, Simon.

00:32:59.329 --> 00:33:11.259
We have found the Messiah,

00:33:11.259 --> 00:33:19.660
and he led him to Jesus.

00:33:19.660 --> 00:33:33.539
And you, Simon,

00:33:33.539 --> 00:33:34.539
the Son of John,

00:33:34.539 --> 00:33:41.369
will be called Seifas.

00:33:41.369 --> 00:33:55.740
The next day,

00:33:55.740 --> 00:33:57.740
he wanted to leave for Galilee.

00:33:57.740 --> 00:34:10.179
Jesus then found,

00:34:10.179 --> 00:34:11.179
Philip,

00:34:11.179 --> 00:34:14.480
and said to him,

00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:17.889
Be my follower.

00:34:17.889 --> 00:34:21.550
Now Philip was from Bethseder,

00:34:21.550 --> 00:34:24.550
from the city of Andrew and Peter.

00:34:24.550 --> 00:34:30.389
Philip found,

00:34:30.389 --> 00:34:32.389
Nathaniel.

00:34:32.389 --> 00:34:39.579
Nathaniel.

00:34:39.579 --> 00:34:40.579
We have found the one,

00:34:40.579 --> 00:34:42.579
of whom Moses,

00:34:42.579 --> 00:34:44.579
in the law and the prophets wrote,

00:34:44.579 --> 00:34:45.579
Jesus,

00:34:45.579 --> 00:34:47.579
the Son of Joseph,

00:34:47.579 --> 00:34:49.579
from Nazareth.

00:34:49.579 --> 00:34:55.739
Can anything good come out of Nazareth?

00:34:55.739 --> 00:35:22.760
Come and see.

00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:24.760
Jesus saw Nathaniel coming toward him,

00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:26.760
and said about him.

00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:28.760
See,

00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:30.760
truly,

00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:31.760
an Israelite,

00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:34.760
in whom there is no deceit.

00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:35.760
How do you know me?

00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:45.980
Before Philip called you,

00:35:45.980 --> 00:35:47.980
while you're under the fig tree.

00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:49.980
I saw you.

00:35:49.980 --> 00:36:04.460
Rabbi,

00:36:04.460 --> 00:36:07.460
you are the Son of God.

00:36:07.460 --> 00:36:11.460
You are King of Israel.

00:36:11.460 --> 00:36:12.460
Do you believe,

00:36:12.460 --> 00:36:15.460
because I told you I saw you're under the fig tree?

00:36:15.460 --> 00:36:18.460
You will see things greater than these.

00:36:18.460 --> 00:36:21.460
It was truly I say to you, man.

00:36:21.460 --> 00:36:24.460
You will see heaven opened up,

00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:25.460
and the angels of God

00:36:25.460 --> 00:36:27.460
are sending and descending,

00:36:27.460 --> 00:36:28.460
to the Son of Man.

00:36:28.460 --> 00:37:03.800
And on the third day,

00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:06.800
a marriage feast took place,

00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:21.059
in Cana of Galilee,

00:37:21.059 --> 00:37:27.860
and the mother of Jesus was there.

00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:29.860
Jesus and his disciples

00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:31.860
were also invited to the marriage feast,

00:37:31.860 --> 00:38:25.340
on the wine-red short.

00:38:25.340 --> 00:38:28.340
The mother of Jesus said to him,

00:38:28.340 --> 00:38:37.059
they have no wine.

00:38:37.059 --> 00:38:45.019
Why has that of concern to me to you?

00:38:45.019 --> 00:39:21.679
My hour has not yet come.

00:39:21.679 --> 00:39:25.019
His mother said to those serving.

00:39:25.019 --> 00:39:32.210
Do whatever he tells you.

00:39:32.210 --> 00:39:35.210
Now there were six stone water jars sitting there,

00:39:35.210 --> 00:39:39.210
as required by the purification rules of the Jews.

00:39:39.210 --> 00:39:42.210
Each able to hold two or three liquid measures.

00:39:42.210 --> 00:39:49.739
Fill the jars with water.

00:39:49.739 --> 00:41:15.170
So they filled them

00:41:15.170 --> 00:41:16.170
to the brim.

00:41:16.170 --> 00:41:55.610
Draw some out,

00:41:55.610 --> 00:42:17.480
and take it to the director of the feast.

00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:19.480
So they took it.

00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:39.780
When the director of the feast

00:42:39.780 --> 00:42:43.780
tasted the water that had now been turned into wine,

00:42:43.780 --> 00:42:45.780
not knowing where it came from,

00:42:45.780 --> 00:42:48.780
although the servants who had drawn out the water knew.

00:42:48.780 --> 00:42:59.940
The director of the feast called the bridegroom

00:42:59.940 --> 00:43:00.940
and said to him,

00:43:00.940 --> 00:43:06.349
everyone else looked out the fine wine first.

00:43:06.349 --> 00:43:09.349
And when people are intoxicated,

00:43:09.349 --> 00:43:31.219
the inferior you have saved the fine wine until now.

00:43:31.219 --> 00:43:34.219
Jesus did this encana of Galilee

00:43:34.219 --> 00:43:36.219
as the beginning of his signs,

00:43:36.219 --> 00:43:50.070
and he made his glory manifest,

00:43:50.070 --> 00:43:53.070
and his disciples put their faith in him.

00:43:53.070 --> 00:44:12.480
After this,

00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:14.480
he and his mother,

00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:17.480
and his brothers and his disciples,

00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:19.480
went down to Capernaum,

00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:26.960
but they did not stay there many days.

00:44:26.960 --> 00:45:36.780
Now the Passover of the Jews was near,

00:45:36.780 --> 00:45:38.780
and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.

00:45:38.780 --> 00:46:31.280
He found in the temple,

00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:33.280
those selling cattle,

00:46:33.280 --> 00:46:35.280
and sheep,

00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:37.280
and doves.

00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:42.989
For a sheep of this quality,

00:46:42.989 --> 00:46:43.989
why do you ask for more?

00:46:43.989 --> 00:46:45.989
That is the price.

00:46:45.989 --> 00:46:47.989
This is all we have.

00:46:47.989 --> 00:47:10.250
Money brokers in their seats.

00:47:10.250 --> 00:48:39.420
After making a whip of ropes,

00:48:39.420 --> 00:48:48.239
he drove all those with the sheep and cattle

00:48:48.239 --> 00:48:49.239
out of the temple,

00:48:49.239 --> 00:48:59.789
and he poured out the coins of the money changes,

00:48:59.789 --> 00:49:21.250
turned their tables,

00:49:21.250 --> 00:49:23.250
and he said to those selling the doves.

00:49:23.250 --> 00:49:26.849
Take these things away from here.

00:49:26.849 --> 00:49:47.059
Stop making a house of my father.

00:49:47.059 --> 00:49:49.059
A house of commerce.

00:49:49.059 --> 00:49:56.159
His disciples recalled that it is written,

00:49:56.159 --> 00:50:01.570
the zeal for your house will consume me.

00:50:01.570 --> 00:50:11.469
What sign can you show us

00:50:11.469 --> 00:50:16.519
since you're doing these things?

00:50:16.519 --> 00:50:19.519
Tehran, this temple,

00:50:19.519 --> 00:50:23.519
in three days, I will raise it up.

00:50:23.519 --> 00:50:28.519
This temple was built in 46 years.

00:50:28.519 --> 00:50:32.519
And will you raise it up in three days?

00:50:32.519 --> 00:50:35.519
But he was talking about the temple of his body.

00:50:35.519 --> 00:50:40.960
When, though, he was raised up from the dead,

00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:44.960
his disciples recalled that he used to say this,

00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:47.960
and they believed in this scripture,

00:50:47.960 --> 00:50:49.960
and what Jesus had spoken,

00:50:49.960 --> 00:51:20.739
when he was in Jerusalem at the festival of the Passover.

00:51:20.739 --> 00:51:23.739
Many people put their faith in his name,

00:51:23.739 --> 00:51:25.739
when they saw the signs that he was performing,

00:51:25.739 --> 00:51:58.730
but Jesus would not entrust himself to them,

00:51:58.730 --> 00:52:02.360
because he knew them all,

00:52:02.360 --> 00:52:27.260
and because he did not need to have anyone there witness about man.

00:52:27.260 --> 00:52:32.079
For he knew what was in man.
