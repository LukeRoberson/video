00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.850
It was really nice of Maria to invite me in service,

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:34.630
but I already have plans with Sarah.

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:36.630
We have similar service schedules,

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.630
and we really enjoy working together.

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:51.719
I try to get most of my time during the week.

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.109
Anyone made plans to work together?

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:01.109
Though I do meet with the group sometimes on Saturday.

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.109
Sister Martin, can you...

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:10.980
Thanks everyone. Anyone made plans to work together?

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:15.670
Okay, Joanna, you can work with Sarah.

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:25.060
Anyone made plans to work together?

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.060
Could I work with Alicia?

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.060
Uh-huh.

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.060
Okay.

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.060
Joanna, could you two work together, please?

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.060
I'd love to, but I've just arranged to work with Sarah.

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.060
I'm so sorry.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.060
No problem.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.060
Maria, could you work with this sister?

00:01:42.060 --> 00:02:05.670
While doing my Bible reading that night,

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.669
I was really affected by the words found

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:12.669
at 2nd Corinthians 6, 12, and 13.

00:02:12.669 --> 00:02:16.669
You are restricted in your own tender affections.

00:02:16.669 --> 00:02:24.340
Open your heart's wide.

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.340
It struck me that some in the congregation

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.340
missed out on a beautiful blessing

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.340
by drawing away from the Apostle Paul.

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:40.090
I realized I was limiting my joy as well

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.090
by not working with more in the ministry.

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.090
I was going through the motions of pioneering,

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.090
but I was stuck in the same routine.

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.090
How are you, Maria?

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:53.090
Good.

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.090
And you?

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.090
Let me ask you something.

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.090
Could you join me on a Bible study Saturday?

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.090
Oh, I'd love that.

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:59.090
That's great.

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.090
So later we'll make the arrangements, okay?

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.090
Exactly.

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:15.169
My student liked Maria and Isabelle so much.

00:03:15.169 --> 00:03:19.169
I really learned a lot from them.

00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:29.099
I started going out regularly on the weekends.

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:31.099
Anyone made plans to work together?

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:34.099
And working with different ones in the ministry.

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:41.000
And I learned more about Sister Martin

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
after one day in the ministry

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000
than I had in years of seeing her at meetings.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Sarah and I still enjoy working together.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
But I found that by working with a variety of friends,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
my own joy has increased.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:14.840
I'm so glad I opened my heart wide.
