00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:23.699
Caring for the needs of my family is a source of great joy.

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:34.189
That was the life that was.

00:00:34.189 --> 00:00:43.030
One drunk driver and my wife was gone.

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.030
Our two children had lost their loving mother.

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:57.280
The doctors were hopeful that my son might regain the use of his legs.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:05.230
But in the meantime, we needed to adjust to this new situation.

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:12.230
My mum was such a support both emotionally and practically.

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:20.180
She helped with the children whilst I went to work.

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.180
That way I was able to care for the family's physical needs.

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:30.299
It wasn't easy.

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:42.819
I don't know what I would have done without her.

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:46.819
My fellow elders were loving and considerate too.

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:50.819
They offered to lighten some of my congregation responsibilities.

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:55.829
But I just wanted to keep busy.

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.829
I tried to keep on top of everything.

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:03.829
But spiritually things began to slip.

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:08.830
On more than one occasion, I had to ask others to cover my meeting parts.

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:09.830
Hello.

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:10.830
Hi Simon.

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.240
Oh hi I'm so sorry.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.240
I've been held up at work again.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.240
Could you cover the treasure's item for me tonight?

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.620
I'll see what I can do.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.909
Thank you.

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:34.169
I was just too tired to prepare for family worship.

00:02:34.169 --> 00:02:36.169
And the results were obvious.

00:02:36.169 --> 00:02:55.460
Everything seemed overwhelming.

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.460
Even the simple things were a struggle.

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:06.629
The meeting was great.

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:07.629
But that...

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:18.180
It's demonstration tonight.

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:28.330
Oh sorry.

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.330
Something had to give.

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.330
Maybe I needed to step aside as an elder.

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.330
I needed help.

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:41.330
So I reached out to a good friend, Simon.

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:44.330
I explained everything.

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.330
He really listened.

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.330
He empathised and commended me for my efforts.

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:53.330
Then shared Philippians one, ten with me.

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:57.330
That you may make sure of the more important things.

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:02.330
Oliver, it's especially during challenging times

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.330
that we need to make sure of the important things.

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:11.060
And the key to doing that is balance.

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.060
Come over here.

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:20.060
Simon used a simple illustration that changed my perspective.

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.060
Just as a wheel can be out of balance.

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:29.060
A sudden change in our circumstances can put us out of balance.

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:35.060
But skilled mechanics can use small weights to rebalance the wheel.

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.060
The machine told Simon where to position the small weight

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.060
so that the wheel could run smoothly again.

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.060
I got the point.

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.060
Regaining balance might not involve big changes.

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.060
Just a few smaller ones.

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:58.970
Balance comes when we exercise faith.

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:07.430
Hebrews 116 reminded me that Jehovah is the rewarder of those earnestly seeking him.

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:11.430
And James 317 says,

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:14.430
The wisdom from above is reasonable.

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:20.430
I realise that my family's spiritual needs are one of the more important things.

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:24.430
And it's okay to ask others for support.

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:37.050
Applying these Bible principles helped me regain my joy.

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:40.050
Our circumstances may change,

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:46.029
but our Christian priorities do not.

00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:54.069
They keep us anchored to our living hope.

00:05:54.069 --> 00:05:56.069
Thanks to Jehovah,

00:05:56.069 --> 00:06:01.069
I was able to provide for my own in the most important ways.
