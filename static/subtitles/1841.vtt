00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:07.780
At 6am my husband and I were woken up by a loud bang on the door.

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:13.779
As soon as my husband had opened the door, people burst in shouting, everyone on the floor.

00:00:13.779 --> 00:00:20.780
I saw them taking my husband into the kitchen and heard them very aggressively ordering him to do something.

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:25.780
Then I heard some noise and I realized that he was being beaten.

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:29.780
My husband Felix and I were on our way back from the shopping mall

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:31.780
to the car park.

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:39.780
A jeep with tinted windows blocked our path and people with weapons jumped out shouting, on the ground, don't move.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.780
We were thrown against the vehicle.

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:50.020
Felix was sent to a pretrial detention facility where he spent a year.

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:57.020
From the very first bang on the door I began praying to Jehovah for wisdom, calmness and for holy spirit

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:03.020
so that I could make the right decisions and act in the right way and for the whole day I was praying.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:08.019
Jehovah answered all my prayers and I felt that he was close at my side.

00:01:08.019 --> 00:01:18.810
Before each court hearing when I was very afraid and felt overwhelmed by emotion and couldn't calm myself down,

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.500
it was prayer that helped me to settle down.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:32.500
When they took us for interrogation I started panicking and at that moment I realized that I needed to meditate on something positive.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:41.500
So I thought I need to sing our songs and just one song came into my mind, he will make you strong.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.500
It really strengthened me.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.500
Those words about how a Jehovah gave his son for us, shows he loves us and will never leave us.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:57.019
Brothers and sisters pray and tell me that they are praying for me.

00:01:57.019 --> 00:02:02.019
It gives me the feeling that I am part of a large family.

00:02:02.019 --> 00:02:08.860
After the interrogation he was sent home.

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.860
My husband and I continued to stick to our spiritual routine.

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.860
We continued to conduct family worship and we are always in the ministry.

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.860
Our brothers and sisters constantly support us.

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:31.430
They write kind words, they commend us, they send us encouraging scriptures from the Bible.

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:41.430
In September 2019 Felix was found guilty and sentenced to three years in a general regime colony.

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.430
When he and the other brothers arrived there they were beaten up by officers from the colony.

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:53.509
Felix told me that he prayed while he was being beaten.

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:58.509
And he noticed that at that moment he stopped feeling the pain.

00:02:58.509 --> 00:03:07.229
While he is behind bars Felix tries to conduct family worship with me by letters.

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:12.229
He picks certain themes and some specific questions.

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:20.110
Then I do research in the publications and send back what I find.

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.110
The scripture at Isaiah 30 really strengthens me.

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:29.110
Where it says that your strength will be in keeping calm and showing trust.

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:37.110
Although I tend to worry I understood that calmness is expressed by fully trusting in Jehovah.

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:48.900
I have become stronger because thanks to Jehovah in a way I have developed almost a shell against the difficulties that used to scare me.

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:55.900
That confidence and faith help me. Jehovah was with me and he will remain close by me.

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:01.900
And we will be made stronger thanks to him and we will get through these trials.
