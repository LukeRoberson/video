00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:05.990
It felt like a bad dream.

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:09.990
Our family were really zealous in the truth.

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.990
We were playing downstairs one day,

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.989
and Mom came down to tell us she was leaving Jehovah and leaving Dad.

00:00:16.989 --> 00:00:20.989
Saying goodbye to Mom, that was the hardest day of my life.

00:00:20.989 --> 00:00:25.989
My mother and father became inactive when I was about four years old.

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:28.989
My father was never really around.

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:31.989
When my mom started to learn the truth,

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:34.990
my dad said she was forbidden from studying.

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:38.990
If we were to go to the meetings, he would take us out forcibly.

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:42.990
He became verbally and physically abusive to my mom.

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.990
My parents' breakup was very tough.

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:49.990
It was a struggle for my mother to raise two boys on her own.

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:54.990
She would work two or three jobs and serving Jehovah just took a back seat.

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:58.990
When my parents divorced, my mom was very depressed.

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:00.990
She did the best she could,

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:05.989
but Jehovah didn't intend for mothers to fill both roles as parents.

00:01:05.989 --> 00:01:08.989
My sisters and I, we made a conscious choice

00:01:08.989 --> 00:01:12.989
that we weren't going to make the same bad choices that Mom did.

00:01:12.989 --> 00:01:15.989
We realized that it's up to us.

00:01:15.989 --> 00:01:20.989
So I dedicated my life to Jehovah and was baptized when I was 15.

00:01:20.989 --> 00:01:25.989
We thrived spiritually when we didn't have the opposition from Dad.

00:01:26.989 --> 00:01:29.989
Now we can go out and service, go to the meetings freely.

00:01:29.989 --> 00:01:32.989
We didn't have to hide our literature for fear he would rip them up.

00:01:32.989 --> 00:01:37.989
When I was around 15 years old, my mother took us to the meeting

00:01:37.989 --> 00:01:41.989
and she was determined that this was going to be her last meeting.

00:01:41.989 --> 00:01:44.989
It was the night of a local needs party.

00:01:44.989 --> 00:01:48.989
It was the right time Jehovah just opened my mother's heart.

00:01:48.989 --> 00:01:51.989
Why? After that experience,

00:01:51.989 --> 00:01:54.989
it was like she was a new woman.

00:01:54.989 --> 00:01:56.989
My sisters and I have always been a team.

00:01:56.989 --> 00:01:58.989
We pioneered together,

00:01:58.989 --> 00:02:01.989
we moved to Cambodia to serve as their greatest together.

00:02:01.989 --> 00:02:03.989
They're both in special full-time service

00:02:03.989 --> 00:02:05.989
with their husbands in Cambodia.

00:02:05.989 --> 00:02:07.989
And I've been serving here in Myanmar Bethel,

00:02:07.989 --> 00:02:11.990
along with my husband for just over 11 years now.

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.990
My mom set a stellar example for me to follow.

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.990
Her relationship with Jehovah was always above everything else.

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.990
It was her example that helped me to set and reach spiritual goals.

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.990
I started pioneering during my senior year of high school

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.990
in nearly 20 years of full-time service,

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:34.990
spending most of that time at Brooklyn Bethel and Warwick with my wife.

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:38.990
My mother had a very strong influence on theocratic goals.

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:41.990
My wife and I had the privilege of attending the first school,

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:43.990
the Kingdom Evangelizers,

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:47.990
and currently we're serving in the circuit work.

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:50.990
No one needs to be defined by their negative circumstances.

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:52.990
First Peter 5-10 says,

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:55.990
God himself will complete your training.

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:57.990
It might be tough at times,

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.990
but what Jehovah's help you can succeed.

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:04.990
It reminds me of what David said in the 27th Psalm in verse 10.

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.990
He said,

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:09.990
even if my father or mother abandoned me,

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:11.990
Jehovah would take me in.

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:15.990
That was definitely the case in my situation.

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:19.990
Jehovah doesn't define us by our upbringing or our past.

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:21.990
He sees our potential,

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.990
so it's up to us.

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:25.990
With Jehovah, we can be anything we want to be.
