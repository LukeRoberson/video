00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:24.660
The locals call this Bowden's Pool,

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.739
after the Germanic pagan god,

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:30.820
who was credited with creating earth, sky, man, and woman.

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.259
The water is the source of the river lip,

00:00:34.259 --> 00:00:37.140
which flows from the spar town of Bad Lipspringer,

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.899
into the Rhine and the industrial areas of the Ruhr Valley.

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:43.780
Today, it's a peaceful and prosperous little town,

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.539
just as it was 60 years ago,

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.939
when France and Hilder Kusserer arrived here

00:00:47.939 --> 00:00:49.380
with our 11 children.

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.700
What began as a peaceful ittle became an epic battle

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.060
between good and evil,

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:58.179
as the Kussero's defied Hitler and the Nazi regime.

00:00:59.299 --> 00:01:02.820
France and Hilder Kusserer were married in 1911,

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.420
three years before the Great War that traumatized Europe.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.659
France Kusserer fought for his country,

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:10.900
but his life and beliefs were transformed.

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.549
The Kussero's story has been lovingly

00:01:17.629 --> 00:01:21.230
chronicled by the eldest of the 11 children, Anne Marie,

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:22.670
now aged 78.

00:01:28.209 --> 00:01:32.609
Anne Marie's parents were born into a comfortably off Protestant environment,

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:36.609
but the First World War and a chance meeting with the Jehovah's Witness

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:38.370
dramatically changed their lives.

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.489
France, at post office Clark and Hilder,

00:01:41.489 --> 00:01:42.930
a former school teacher,

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.689
became full-time missionaries

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:47.329
for the International Bible Students Association.

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.129
They came to this house on the outskirts of Bad Lipspringer,

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.010
to set up congregations in Northwest failure.

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:58.049
No Kussero's live here today,

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.450
but when members of the family do return,

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.650
they're a vivid memories.

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:05.170
Mike Delena is the Kussero's fourth daughter.

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.010
What are your early memories of this house?

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.569
It was so nice. We played here in the garden.

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:14.210
And this little piece and then there,

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:15.969
also we had some trees,

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:18.449
these apples and some fruits.

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:23.409
We had some potatoes,

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:27.169
these salad and different things.

00:02:29.169 --> 00:02:31.330
We played, we danced together,

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.569
and then they took some flowers,

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:36.449
they made a ring on the head.

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:45.409
Then we went down with these to the river,

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:48.370
to the river to bring the geese,

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.169
and they have to, they cooked.

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:52.849
Swim? No, swim?

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:55.090
All the two, yes, and we swam all the way.

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:56.289
You took the geese for a swim?

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:57.650
Yeah, yeah.

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.610
And on the way, they took the grass and they ate,

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:01.889
and they had many fun.

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.669
It's a long time since I was here,

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:13.389
not since 1939, I think.

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:16.030
The doors seem bigger then.

00:03:20.189 --> 00:03:22.270
Hans Werner, now 63,

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:24.110
was the Kussero's 10th child.

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:29.550
It was a very happy time.

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.550
Especially as I had so many brothers and sisters.

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.750
Everything was happy until I went to school.

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:37.150
That was bad of course.

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:40.990
Every day when children went to school,

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:46.030
they sought in advance what will happen today?

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:47.150
What will happen today?

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.229
I remember many things.

00:03:51.789 --> 00:03:54.110
I remember how strong we were,

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:56.270
how we didn't salute the flag,

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:57.069
how we wouldn't say,

00:03:57.229 --> 00:04:01.150
how we acted a bit differently from other pupils.

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.550
Some days, their hearts and teachers were like a devil,

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:08.830
and he took my hand.

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:09.469
He said,

00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:12.349
Hi, Hitler, I, Hitler, and beat me.

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:13.469
What are you so frightened?

00:04:13.469 --> 00:04:16.509
They would hit you, did you never say hi, Hitler?

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:18.350
No, no, we never said.

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:19.870
Because my father said,

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:20.910
look,

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.790
Hi, Hitler means the salvation comes from Hitler.

00:04:26.589 --> 00:04:28.269
Is we learned survival?

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.870
The high, the salvation comes by Jesus Christ.

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:39.339
The Kussero's house was known as the golden age.

00:04:39.339 --> 00:04:42.699
A huge sign advertising the Jehovah's Witness magazine

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:45.740
was emblazoned in gold letters outside their home.

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:50.540
Inside, the parents gave the children their love and their time.

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.420
And they taught the Bible and music,

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:56.139
lessons which would have a lifetime's impact.

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:49.180
The Kussero's then and now firmly believe the creder

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:50.779
the Jehovah's Witnesses

00:05:50.779 --> 00:05:53.259
that our world now influenced by Satan

00:05:53.259 --> 00:05:56.779
will soon be transformed into the 1,000-year reign of Christ,

00:05:56.779 --> 00:05:58.220
promised in the Bible.

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:07.920
The evil will die,

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:11.279
whilst the good and faithful will be physically reborn

00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:12.480
into paradise.

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:40.560
It was for morning to the evening visiting people

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:43.680
who like to know what the Bible says

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:46.639
about preaching or missionary work.

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:48.879
They like to receive me.

00:06:50.959 --> 00:06:53.680
Much of the literature distributed by the Kussero's

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.920
came from the Witnesses headquarters in New York.

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.439
In Germany, the Witnesses were a very small sect

00:06:59.439 --> 00:07:01.360
of just 20,000 people,

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:05.279
and yet Hitler saw the movement as a rival ideology to the Nazis.

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:09.360
So he set out to seize their literature and wreck the organisation.

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:12.560
So where were the books and the literature?

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:13.360
Where was it?

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:14.560
Also, here also.

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.399
On the under the stairs?

00:07:16.399 --> 00:07:17.279
Yes, there.

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:19.600
And also up here.

00:07:20.639 --> 00:07:23.600
And how many times did the police come to the house?

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:26.560
Oh, many, many times.

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:28.319
And they hit them here?

00:07:28.319 --> 00:07:29.199
Here?

00:07:29.199 --> 00:07:29.839
Yes.

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:33.120
Here, here are these tiny,

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:35.839
tibre doors of the,

00:07:35.839 --> 00:07:37.759
yeah, on the roof.

00:07:37.759 --> 00:07:39.680
And since the books here,

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:43.920
10 metres long,

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:45.360
here, 10 metres,

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:46.639
and the Bücheran,

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:50.399
and then we put the stones into the light

00:07:50.399 --> 00:07:52.879
and threw them over.

00:07:52.879 --> 00:07:53.680
Here.

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:58.399
And here was a balcony,

00:07:58.399 --> 00:07:59.839
and once again a balcony,

00:07:59.839 --> 00:08:01.519
we had to go very carefully.

00:08:01.519 --> 00:08:02.480
They came,

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:04.319
how many times did you say?

00:08:04.319 --> 00:08:06.639
18 times,

00:08:06.639 --> 00:08:08.879
16, 17, 18s.

00:08:08.879 --> 00:08:11.279
And they always searched in this area?

00:08:11.279 --> 00:08:13.279
Not found the books.

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:16.800
The Nazis weren't easily dissuaded.

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:20.639
The Golden Age sign on the Kustro's house was blacked out.

00:08:20.639 --> 00:08:23.839
But although the witnesses had been officially banned,

00:08:23.839 --> 00:08:27.519
the family maintained their religious activities in secret.

00:08:27.519 --> 00:08:29.120
She said,

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:33.519
Magdalena, you go behind three, four metre behind me.

00:08:33.519 --> 00:08:35.120
You carry the Bible

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:37.120
that I have nothing in my hand,

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:39.919
and she spoke with the people.

00:08:40.879 --> 00:08:44.000
And there were one man.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.679
I don't know what he,

00:08:45.679 --> 00:08:46.720
he was a stranger.

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:49.600
He didn't belong to Batlif Springer.

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:51.440
And he denounced us.

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:53.120
He calls the police.

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:55.600
In 1936, six,

00:08:55.600 --> 00:09:01.360
the first time my mother was arrested to Parabond.

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:04.799
This was the first time.

00:09:04.799 --> 00:09:08.639
Franz and Hilda Kussero were among the hundreds of Jehovah's Witnesses

00:09:08.639 --> 00:09:12.320
arrested by the Gestapo in 1936.

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:15.120
They were briefly reunited in 1937

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:18.879
when this last complete family photograph was taken.

00:09:18.879 --> 00:09:20.000
Later that year,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.279
that sun's secret died in a swimming accident.

00:09:23.279 --> 00:09:27.120
His death signaled the end of the ittle.

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:30.399
By now, most Germans were wallowing in nationalistic pride

00:09:30.399 --> 00:09:32.720
and revived economic fortune.

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:34.960
Communists, gypsies, homosexuals,

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:36.799
dissidents, the handicapped,

00:09:36.799 --> 00:09:38.240
and above all the Jews

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:43.940
were hunted down, even in Batlif Springer.

00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:47.940
Today, the town memorializes its former Jewish residents.

00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:49.860
Little more than 50 years ago,

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:54.940
they were handing them out and bane for their blood.

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:56.940
It seems a long while ago,

00:09:56.940 --> 00:10:02.879
for the moment, dissidents are tolerated.

00:10:02.879 --> 00:10:06.559
Jehovah's Witnesses can sell their magazine, the watchtower,

00:10:06.559 --> 00:10:11.919
and openly recruit converts.

00:10:11.919 --> 00:10:16.399
In the 1930s, this street in Parabond was dominated by the prison,

00:10:16.399 --> 00:10:19.360
and this is where the Kusaroes were jailed.

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:22.399
Witnesses began to lose their jobs and pensions.

00:10:22.399 --> 00:10:25.279
The Gestapo stepped up their surveillance,

00:10:25.279 --> 00:10:29.279
but the Kusaro's garden was still supplying fresh produce.

00:10:29.279 --> 00:10:31.120
The three youngest members of the family

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:32.960
were being well cared for.

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:34.960
They were the next target.

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:44.559
At that time, I was ill and didn't go to school.

00:10:44.559 --> 00:10:47.360
I was lying in bed here.

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:54.399
Suddenly, a car drove up.

00:10:54.399 --> 00:10:56.320
There seemed to be two civilians in it.

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:58.320
I could see them from the window.

00:11:03.519 --> 00:11:06.960
They burst in and wanted me to go with them.

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:09.360
They hesitated because I was ill.

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:11.600
And for appearances, Sake took me to a doctor

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:14.240
to see if I could be taken away.

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:20.000
I had to go to the doctor to see if I could be taken away.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.840
Then, they collected my sister and brother from school.

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:24.960
And we left.

00:11:33.919 --> 00:11:36.080
We were taken from school.

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:39.519
My brother, who was ill, was collected from home.

00:11:39.519 --> 00:11:42.559
And we were taken by two policemen

00:11:42.559 --> 00:11:44.240
to the orphanage in Dorsten.

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:53.200
I can still remember how I vomited all over the jacket

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:55.039
of one of the policemen.

00:11:55.039 --> 00:11:58.720
It took a lot of effort to clean it up once the car stopped.

00:12:01.519 --> 00:12:04.799
Then the journey continued to Dorsten and the orphanage.

00:12:12.639 --> 00:12:15.919
In the morning, he again told us to give the Hitler salute.

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:20.960
And when we refused, he took us into a room,

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:24.480
laid us across the table and beat us black and blue.

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:27.840
It was bad.

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:35.120
We took a shower every evening.

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:37.840
And when the female head of the house saw us,

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:41.600
she made us bathe separately so that the other children would not see.

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:44.080
It was very bad.

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:47.919
When the Second World War began,

00:12:47.919 --> 00:12:51.600
the two-old is Kusaro daughters Anne Marie and Valtraud,

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:54.399
escaped surveillance and left to find jobs in Berlin.

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:56.960
It was more difficult for their brothers.

00:12:57.519 --> 00:12:59.279
In December 1939,

00:12:59.279 --> 00:13:03.120
Wilhelm, after refusing military service, was thrown into jail.

00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:07.220
Dear parents, brothers and sisters,

00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:10.500
all of you know how much you mean to me.

00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:15.220
And I am repeatedly reminded of this every time I look at our family photograph.

00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:17.779
How harmonious things always were at home.

00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:24.340
Nonetheless, above all else, we must love God as our fiora Jesus Christ commanded.

00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:27.860
If we stand up for him, he will reward us.

00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:31.940
As predominantly Aryan Germans,

00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:35.460
Jehovah's Witnesses were sometimes allowed the privilege of a Nazi trial.

00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:40.019
Later, Wilhelm's court appointed lawyer, Dr. James Raw,

00:13:40.019 --> 00:13:40.899
wrote to the family.

00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:47.620
I had long conversations with your son before his trial and admired his calm confidence of

00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:52.179
faith. He never wavered, although he was severely pressed for more quarters.

00:13:53.059 --> 00:13:56.340
He calmly accepted the announcement of the eye of his execution,

00:13:56.899 --> 00:14:02.259
refusing again to change his mind, that is, to abandon his faith and save his life.

00:14:04.179 --> 00:14:07.860
On the morning of the execution, I took his hand and said in consolation,

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:13.620
Mr. Kusaro, you have been wonderfully strong, remain strong now.

00:14:14.179 --> 00:14:19.539
He squeezed my hand and smilingly replied, no doctor, don't be troubled.

00:14:20.179 --> 00:14:24.740
I am gaining everlasting life. All this is only a change.

00:14:26.019 --> 00:14:28.340
He asked me to send you his greetings.

00:14:29.379 --> 00:14:33.059
He stood upright when facing death and was dead at once.

00:14:37.279 --> 00:14:41.360
Unable to browbeat the witnesses, the Nazis tried lies and subterfuge.

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:46.799
With an elaborate ritual of deceit, they issued certificates and reports,

00:14:46.799 --> 00:14:50.399
declaring that Wilhelm Kusaro had died a hero's death,

00:14:50.399 --> 00:14:52.480
fighting for Hitler and the Third Reich.

00:14:57.250 --> 00:15:01.490
For some unknown reason, the Nazis allowed the family to collect Wilhelm's body from

00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:07.009
Munster Prison, where he'd been shot. His sister, Valtraald, helped arrange the funeral.

00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:14.370
It shocked me, dear, but Wilhelm was too, until the days.

00:15:15.009 --> 00:15:27.169
I have seen the body in the little hall there, and he was in a private suite or a suite,

00:15:27.809 --> 00:15:38.129
and until here, Löcher, the bullet holes, and the blood was in the mouth.

00:15:38.850 --> 00:15:47.409
There was a big funeral with a secret police around and then with persons in uniform policemen.

00:15:48.210 --> 00:15:58.850
And my brother Karl had said some words, and later my brother Karl,

00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:07.490
because he spoke a few words and the prayer Gestapo kept him.

00:16:08.850 --> 00:16:14.850
Karl, son number three, was the next arrested. He was brutally tortured in Dakar and Saxon

00:16:14.929 --> 00:16:20.850
House and concentration camps. In April 1941, the Gestapo swooped again.

00:16:21.649 --> 00:16:25.970
After a brief release from jail, France and Hilder Kusaro were re-arrested,

00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:31.649
as were their daughters Hildegard and Magdalena. Nazi tenants took over the house

00:16:31.649 --> 00:16:37.730
that once proclaimed the dawning of a golden age. The Kusaroes were sent to concentration camps,

00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:43.250
where the witnesses were forced to wear distinctive insignia. The Jews wore a yellow star,

00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:52.129
the witnesses, a purple triangle. When we went through the concentration camp, we saw

00:16:53.090 --> 00:17:00.129
this purple triangle, then I knew there's my sister. I said, hello sister, how are you?

00:17:00.129 --> 00:17:06.289
What's your name? Where you come from? The witnesses fed better in the camps than many prisoners.

00:17:07.009 --> 00:17:11.009
Absolute conviction in their faith and strict discipline helped them a rail.

00:17:11.809 --> 00:17:16.849
Soon Magdalena was joined at Ravensbrook by her mother and her sister Hildegard.

00:17:16.849 --> 00:17:24.369
I saw my mother, I was so happy and she told me everything she was happy and it was really good

00:17:24.369 --> 00:17:30.289
because I had swollen arms, I couldn't walk, I couldn't dress myself because of this sickness,

00:17:30.930 --> 00:17:38.130
was home or something. And my mother, she dressed me, she made my hair.

00:17:39.089 --> 00:17:44.769
Despite the evil and hardship at Ravensbrook, Fra Kusaro kept her faith. Her son,

00:17:44.769 --> 00:17:50.210
Wilhelm, had given his life for the faith and younger brother Wolfgang, when called for military

00:17:50.210 --> 00:17:56.210
service, showed true Kusaro defiance. I was brought up as one of Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:17:56.210 --> 00:18:02.529
according to God's word contained in the Holy Scriptures. The greatest and most holy law he

00:18:02.529 --> 00:18:08.369
gave mankind is, you shall love your God above all else and your neighbor as yourself.

00:18:09.650 --> 00:18:17.569
Other commandments read, you must not kill. Did our creator have all this written down for the trees?

00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:27.230
Just as Jesus Christ and his disciples were persecuted, so our God's people also persecuted

00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:34.190
today, I know for sure that if Jesus Christ were to live on earth today, he would be persecuted

00:18:34.269 --> 00:18:44.980
just as he was then. Wolfgang was beheaded on March 28, 1942. The night before he wrote,

00:18:46.579 --> 00:18:51.940
My dear parents and my dear brothers and sisters, I shall leave you as your third son and brother

00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:58.019
early in the morning. Be not sad. The time will come when we shall be together again. Those

00:18:58.019 --> 00:19:07.700
who sow with tears will reap with joy. In James 1 verse 12 it says, blessed is the man that

00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:13.779
endures temptation. For when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which Jehovah has

00:19:13.779 --> 00:19:20.259
promised to them that love him. In this faith and in this conviction, I go from you. Your son and

00:19:20.259 --> 00:19:31.329
brother, Wolfgang. By now, Valtralt had returned from Berlin, a managed to find work in this

00:19:31.329 --> 00:19:39.170
floor shop in Paddeborn. She was ordered to greet customers with the Hild Hitler salutation.

00:19:39.250 --> 00:19:53.809
She refused. After being given eight days to change her mind, she still refused and was arrested

00:19:53.809 --> 00:20:00.769
and imprisoned in Paddeborn and told to make ammunition. I cannot work for the war.

00:20:00.769 --> 00:20:08.529
This I cannot work, this for the war. My brother is killed, this shot. My other brother is beheaded.

00:20:08.529 --> 00:20:18.210
My three sisters, little ones, the Gestapo have kept me and my other brother in concentration

00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:25.809
camp. My mother in concentration camp, my two sisters and also my father in prison. No, I cannot make it.

00:20:27.569 --> 00:20:34.289
By 1944, just one member of the Cusero family was free and Marie, who was still in Berlin.

00:20:35.089 --> 00:20:50.130
Every week, I had with me in my apartment some persons to have a Bible study. And therefore,

00:20:50.130 --> 00:20:56.049
I was arrested, there must be a person who has observed us.

00:20:59.259 --> 00:21:04.779
The Nazis had rounded up every single member of the family. Some were dead and the future for

00:21:04.779 --> 00:21:11.819
the rest uncertain. Yet they had a lifeline. Unlike all other prisoners, Jehovah's witnesses could

00:21:11.819 --> 00:21:16.619
secure their release simply by signing a declaration that they'd abandoned their faith.

00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:27.279
Of the thousands arrested, only a handful did so. I was not ready to sign. I thought

00:21:27.359 --> 00:21:40.720
I have think over my parents, my little children. I mean my brothers and my sisters. They are so

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:49.920
faithful, so obedient. All were so we all were separated. We were all separated. And when I

00:21:50.000 --> 00:22:02.640
now am free, what should I do? My conscience, I have sought it over. It is impossible to be

00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:13.680
unfaithful. How could I sign that I am not a witness? How could I leave my face? Never, never, never.

00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:22.079
In April 1945, Ravenbrook concentration camp was liberated. Hilda Kusaro and her daughters were

00:22:22.079 --> 00:22:28.079
released. Imprisonment had strengthened their faith and morally the witnesses had defeated the

00:22:28.079 --> 00:22:34.559
Nazis. Hilda was reunited with her husband and with the surviving members of the family rebuilt

00:22:34.559 --> 00:22:41.680
their lives. Although they never returned to their golden age home, they always remained faithful

00:22:41.759 --> 00:22:48.000
Jehovah's witnesses. They were back in a Germany where the Protestant and Catholic churches were still

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:54.400
the predominant religious groups. Despite rebellion and martyrdom by some believers, most church

00:22:54.400 --> 00:23:00.559
leaders had bowed the knee to the Nazis. Hitler confirmed a Catholic was never excommunicated.

00:23:01.119 --> 00:23:05.359
The church was silent whilst millions of Jews and others died.

00:23:06.319 --> 00:23:11.200
Among the organized Christian religions in Germany, it was only the Jehovah's witnesses who

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:16.799
refused any compromise at all with Hitler and the Nazis. Like the first Christians, they too

00:23:16.799 --> 00:23:23.279
were reviled and ridiculed and they were martyred. Among the millions who perished in the Holocaust,

00:23:23.279 --> 00:23:29.279
there were some 5,000 Jehovah's witnesses. And yet those who survived still proclaimed there is

00:23:29.279 --> 00:23:39.279
a purpose to all this. There is a God.
