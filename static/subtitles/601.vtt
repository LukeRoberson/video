00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:09.259
What weighs three pounds, requires 10 watts of energy, can perform 10,000 trillion calculations

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:16.579
a second, and has a data storage capacity that some scientists say cannot even be measured.

00:00:16.579 --> 00:00:20.699
Is it the latest computer, electronic device?

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.019
No.

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:28.379
It is the human brain, and our brain is truly amazing.

00:00:28.379 --> 00:00:35.899
Each of its 100 billion nerve cells has thousands of connections to other cells, so our brain

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:38.619
not only stores information.

00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:43.820
It can also use that information to reason and make decisions.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.100
Today our text is from Chapter 6 of Deuteronomy.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.700
Please open your Bibles to that chapter and keep a marker there we're going to refer to

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.500
it a number of times.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:01:01.820
Deuteronomy Chapter 6 illustrates the capacity of our brain to process and store information.

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.099
It also contains some helpful memories.

00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:08.900
Today's text is Verse 7, which is about child training.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:14.980
But that is only a part of the lessons we can learn from this chapter.

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:22.099
Look at verses 1 to 3, and as we read them, picture yourself standing before Moses

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:24.659
and listening to this exhortation.

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.140
Deuteronomy Chapter 6 verses 1 to 3.

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.700
It says, now these are the commandments, the regulations, and the judicial decisions

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.859
that Jehovah your God has given to teach you, so that you may observe them

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:41.780
when you cross over into the land that you are to take possession of.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:47.859
In order that you may fear Jehovah your God and keep all his statutes and his commandments

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:54.900
that I am commanding you, you, your son, and your grandson, all the days of your life

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:01.219
so that you may live a long time and you must listen to Israel and carefully observe them

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:05.939
so that you may prosper and become very many in the land flowing with milk and honey

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:11.300
just as Jehovah the God of your forefathers has promised you.

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:17.060
Just think, the Israelites were not following along in their own copy of the Bible.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.300
They weren't taking notes on paper or an electronic tablet.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.979
They had to use the God-given capacity of their brains to the fall.

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:30.819
They had to concentrate on what was being said, take it to heart,

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:35.860
and then remember all those commandments, regulations, and judicial decisions.

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:42.020
They had to meditate on how this information affected their personal relationship with Jehovah

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.979
and then they had to act on what they heard and teach it to their children.

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.020
That was a tall order.

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.740
How could they remember all of that information?

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.900
Well, it will help if we understand just how our memories work.

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.979
First of all, our memory involves three stages,

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:06.740
processing, storing, and retrieving information.

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:11.300
Second, there are three basic kinds of memory.

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:15.620
We have sensory memory, short-term memory, and long-term memory.

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:22.580
Sensory memory is a memory that receives information through the senses.

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:29.219
We remember how something smells, what it looks like, how does it feel?

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.699
Short-term memory may be called our working memory.

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:38.979
It helps us to retain small amounts of information for a brief period of time,

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:40.900
like when we're dialing a phone number.

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.979
Our long-term memory is needed to store information indefinitely.

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:55.219
The February 2009 issue of Awake contained an article you can improve your memory,

00:03:55.219 --> 00:04:00.020
and it listed eight principles for putting information into our long-term memory.

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:06.099
Let's consider how the Israelites might have applied four of these principles

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:08.580
as they listen to Moses' reading of the law.

00:04:09.219 --> 00:04:13.939
I think you'll find these memory principles helpful to retain Bible instruction

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:18.740
and to benefit from the training that we receive here at Bethel and in the congregation.

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.339
The first principle is interest.

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:28.500
The Israelites could remind themselves of the reasons for wanting to remember what Moses

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:34.100
was telling them, and a primary reason is given right here in Deuteronomy, chapter 6, verse 5,

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:35.459
where it says,

00:04:36.899 --> 00:04:43.459
You must love Jehovah your God with all your heart and all your soul and all your strength.

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:50.100
Yes, a keen interest in Jehovah's instruction was essential in order for the Israelites

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.819
to maintain a close relationship with Jehovah.

00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:56.019
Another principle is attention.

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:03.139
One authority said most memory failures actually represent failures in attention.

00:05:03.939 --> 00:05:09.220
So the Israelites needed to listen carefully and not let anything distract them.

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:15.220
Resetation is another principle that means to repeat things out loud,

00:05:15.939 --> 00:05:19.620
and that strengthens the connections between the brain cells,

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:23.620
and that's exactly what today's text is encouraging us to do.

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:29.220
Deuteronomy 6, verse 7 says you must inculcate them in your sons and speak of them,

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:32.660
or recite them on various occasions.

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:36.740
A fourth principle is visualization.

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:41.779
That means to make a mental picture of what we want to remember.

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:46.420
So as the Israelites heard, Moses speak the words of verse 7.

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:50.980
No doubt they could picture in their own minds opportunities that they would have

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:53.779
to speak of these things to their own children.

00:05:54.660 --> 00:06:01.220
So by all means go back to that February 2009 awake and learn how you can benefit from all eight

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:02.899
of the memory principles.

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:08.899
But now let's look at Deuteronomy 6, verses 8 and 9.

00:06:08.899 --> 00:06:12.420
These verses describe another memory aid.

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:15.300
Let's read Deuteronomy 6, 8, and 9.

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:20.740
It says tie them as a reminder on your hand, and they must be like a headband

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:21.699
on your forehead.

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:26.259
Write them on the doorpost of your house and on your gates.

00:06:27.459 --> 00:06:33.300
Yes, writing things down, taking notes is a good memory aid,

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:37.300
but we don't want to make the mistake of the Jewish religious leaders.

00:06:37.779 --> 00:06:44.100
Sometime after their return from Babylonian exile, they began to apply these words literally.

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:48.180
So they wrote down scripture citations, put them into leather cases,

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:51.300
and then attach those cases to their arms in their forehead.

00:06:53.509 --> 00:06:57.350
But they did this just to draw attention to themselves.

00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:03.910
They failed to understand the clear direction of Deuteronomy 6, verse 6, where it says,

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:08.550
these words that I am commanding you today must be on your heart,

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:11.029
not on your arm, not on your forehead.

00:07:11.589 --> 00:07:17.430
Or as Proverbs 7, 3 says, write them on the tablet of your heart.

00:07:18.389 --> 00:07:24.069
By taking God's instructions to heart, we will have God's laws and principles to guide us

00:07:24.069 --> 00:07:31.350
at all times. Our actions, not a leather case on the body or a plaque that we put on our doorpost,

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:38.149
will be visible evidence that we respect God's word and we apply it personally and as a family.

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:43.509
So does this mean it's wrong for us to have a scripture citation on our desk,

00:07:43.509 --> 00:07:49.589
or perhaps on our refrigerator? No, we even display the year text in our kingdom halls.

00:07:50.709 --> 00:07:55.350
When the printer brothers in Japan had the privilege of printing the first complete Japanese

00:07:55.350 --> 00:08:03.509
New World translation 40 years ago in 1982, they put the citation of Ezra 7, verse 6 on the

00:08:03.509 --> 00:08:11.350
side of the press. And they did this as a reminder that they were sharing in a sacred work that started

00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:19.829
thousands of years earlier, making copies of God's inspired word. As the pages of the Bible

00:08:19.829 --> 00:08:27.189
rolled off the press, the brothers were encouraged by the example of the copyist Ezra to do their best.

00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:36.309
How so? The footnote for Ezra 7, verse 6 in the revised Bible doesn't describe Ezra just as a

00:08:36.309 --> 00:08:45.190
copyist. It says he was a skilled copyist of God's word, so the pressman endeavored to follow Ezra's

00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:53.750
example. So as we take in instruction from God's word and receive training for our sacred service,

00:08:53.750 --> 00:09:00.789
let's apply the memory principles that we learn from Deuteronomy chapter 6. Let's put our 100

00:09:00.789 --> 00:09:07.429
billion nerve cells to work, to process and store that information, and thereby strengthen our

00:09:07.429 --> 00:09:17.909
relationship with Jehovah and do our best in his service.
