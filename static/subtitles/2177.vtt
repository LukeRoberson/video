00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:22.800
I'm writing these letters to Russia because sometimes back here in Malawi we had the same problem

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:29.199
so I'm feeling sorry for my brothers there. As a family we want to join our brothers and sisters

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:34.960
all while writing letters to Russian government to allow them to have a freedom of worship.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:41.600
We feel for our brothers in Russia because we know what the brothers went through in this country

00:00:41.679 --> 00:00:47.520
and so we certainly want to do our best to give support to this letter writing campaign

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:52.320
and so that our brothers in Russia will feel that we're right behind them.

00:00:53.039 --> 00:01:00.399
When the work was under ban in Malawi, brothers were all over the world wrote letters to the government

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:07.920
so we feel the same that if we write letters to Russia the brothers there will know that we love

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:14.079
them too. It's a privilege because it's something that we can physically do.

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:22.480
We pray fervently by the situation but when we actually write a letter we show that we are

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.040
prepared to put ourselves out to do so and it's a great privilege.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:33.439
I was born in the refugee camp in Mozambique. My parents had it to free Malawi because our freedom

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:39.760
of worship was severe restricted. I feel strongly about this letter writing campaign to our

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:45.040
brothers in Russia because it's good a good meaning to me it really happened here the very same

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:52.900
thing that's happening in Russia it happened here. One thing that helped my parents to remain

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:59.540
strong during the ban here in Laon was knowing that they are not alone. So writing in behalf of

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.579
our brothers and sisters in Russia who helped them to have strong faith to know that

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:13.490
brothers and sisters are allowed to love them. Our grandparents used to tell stories about

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:19.810
the restrictions that they had they couldn't meet freely as we're doing now and they had to meet

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:29.710
at night time. I grew up in Estonia during Soviet occupation and I was literally now freedom

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:35.389
of religion that's time. My father and my grandfather's family were deported to Siberia because of

00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:42.430
being she was with me. And there is a reason why I feel that I really want to write the letter to

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:49.550
Russian government and support my brothers this way. As Jova's people who are like one body

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:54.189
when one member of their body is in pain the whole body feels the pain. That's the more we are

00:02:54.189 --> 00:02:58.909
feeling about our brothers in Laxia. The Bible first and with the chapter two this one and two

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:04.030
encourages us that prayers and desessions should be made on behalf of authorities and people

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.509
in their positions so that our brothers and sisters can go on leading a common quiet life.

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:16.110
I feel that writing these letters it really unites me with my brothers and sisters everywhere in the world.
