00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:06.299
Welcome back to our Declare the Good News Convention.

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.300
I'm sure you enjoyed yesterday's sessions.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.300
How exciting it was to see the first segment of our feature drama,

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.300
The Good News, according to Jesus.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.300
What was your favorite scene?

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:25.300
Was it going inside the Holy of the Temple where the aged priest Zechariah

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.300
offered incense to God?

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.300
Or seeing the angel Gabriel tells Zechariah

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.299
that his barren wife Elizabeth would give birth to a boy named John.

00:00:36.299 --> 00:00:39.299
Remember the doubt that Zechariah expressed

00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:42.299
and how that cost him the loss of his speech

00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:45.299
until after the child was born?

00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:50.299
Or was your favorite scene when Gabriel announced to the Virgin Mary

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:53.299
that miraculously she was to become pregnant

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:56.299
and give birth to God's son?

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:58.299
Let's watch that scene again.

00:00:58.299 --> 00:01:01.299
And note what the angel told Mary about the child

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:03.299
who was to be born to her.

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:10.650
Greetings, you highly favored one.

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.650
Jehovah is with you.

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.730
But she was deeply disturbed at his words

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:23.730
and tried to understand what kind of greeting this might be.

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:26.730
Do not be afraid, Mary.

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:33.329
For you have found favor with God and look.

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:37.329
You will become pregnant

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:44.280
and give birth to a son and you are to name him.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:52.909
Jesus, this one will be great

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:56.909
and will be called son of the most high.

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:02.909
And Jehovah God will give him the throne of David his father.

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:08.449
And he will rule his king over the house of Jacob forever

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:17.750
and there will be no end to his kingdom.

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.750
How is this to be?

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.750
Since I am not having sexual relations with a man.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.289
Holy Spirit will come upon you

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:32.289
and the power of the most high will overshadow you.

00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:35.289
And for that reason,

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:38.289
the one who was born will be called holy.

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:48.159
God's son and look, Elizabeth, your relative,

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:51.159
has also conceived the son.

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:53.159
In her old age.

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:59.539
And this is the sixth month for her, the so-called barren woman.

00:02:59.539 --> 00:03:07.469
For no declaration will be impossible for God.

00:03:07.469 --> 00:03:12.979
Look, Jehovah's slave girl,

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:15.979
it happened to me according to your declaration.

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:41.949
What did Gabriel tell Mary?

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:43.949
He said of Jesus,

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:47.949
Jehovah God will give him the throne of David his father

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:50.949
and he will rule his king.

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:53.949
And there will be no end to his kingdom.

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:57.949
That was glorious good news.

00:03:57.949 --> 00:04:00.949
Jehovah was making it known that his own son

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:03.949
would serve as mankind's future ruler.

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:08.949
That shows the intense interest that Jehovah has in us.

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:11.949
That he would have his own beloved son

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:14.949
take over rulership of the earth.

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:19.949
What will we see today in the good news according to Jesus?

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:22.949
For one thing, the exciting event,

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:25.949
when Jehovah's angel declares to the shepherds

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:28.949
who are out in the fields with their flocks,

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:34.949
the good news of a great joy that all the people will have.

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:38.949
And then we'll watch and listen as those shepherds

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:43.949
are privileged to see and hear a multitude of angels

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:45.949
praising Jehovah.

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:48.949
That will be a sight to see.

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:50.949
After the drama,

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:54.949
six speakers will explain to us various prophecies

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:57.949
that were fulfilled regarding the manner

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:00.949
and timing of Jesus' birth.

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:03.949
Of course, the newborn Jesus grows up

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:06.949
to be the Christ, the promised Messiah.

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:08.949
By his teachings,

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:12.949
Jesus reveals Jehovah's provision for our salvation.

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:18.949
He gives up his perfect human life in behalf of mankind.

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:22.949
And then he's resurrected back to heaven

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:26.949
to become the chosen king of God's kingdom.

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:29.949
In future episodes,

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:32.949
we'll see Jesus begin his earthly ministry.

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:35.949
What would be his mission?

00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:39.949
One Sabbath day when he was in the synagogue in Nazareth,

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:42.949
Jesus read from the scroll of Isaiah

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:46.949
and applied those prophetic words to himself.

00:05:46.949 --> 00:05:52.949
Luke 4 verses 18 and 19 quotes Jesus as he read.

00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:55.949
Jehovah's spirit is upon me

00:05:55.949 --> 00:06:00.949
because he anointed me to declare good news to the poor.

00:06:00.949 --> 00:06:03.949
He sent me to proclaim liberty to the captives

00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:06.949
and a recovery of sight to the blind

00:06:07.949 --> 00:06:10.949
to send the crushed ones away free

00:06:10.949 --> 00:06:14.949
to preach Jehovah's acceptable year.

00:06:14.949 --> 00:06:17.949
Then Jesus said today,

00:06:17.949 --> 00:06:22.949
this scripture that you just heard is fulfilled.

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:24.949
Shortly after that,

00:06:24.949 --> 00:06:27.949
as reported at Luke 4 verse 43,

00:06:27.949 --> 00:06:29.949
Jesus told his disciples

00:06:29.949 --> 00:06:32.949
what would be the theme of his preaching.

00:06:32.949 --> 00:06:34.949
He said,

00:06:34.949 --> 00:06:38.949
I must declare the good news of the kingdom of God

00:06:38.949 --> 00:06:42.949
because for this I was sent.

00:06:42.949 --> 00:06:46.949
Why would Jesus say that he must declare the good news?

00:06:46.949 --> 00:06:49.949
On another occasion he explained,

00:06:49.949 --> 00:06:53.949
for the world to know that I love the Father,

00:06:53.949 --> 00:06:58.949
I am doing just as the Father has commanded me to do.

00:06:58.949 --> 00:07:01.949
It was out of his deep love for Jehovah

00:07:01.949 --> 00:07:04.949
that Jesus felt a strong desire to tell others

00:07:04.949 --> 00:07:07.949
about his Heavenly Father.

00:07:07.949 --> 00:07:13.949
Jesus also wanted to counteract the lies Satan had been promoting.

00:07:13.949 --> 00:07:16.949
During his short earthly ministry,

00:07:16.949 --> 00:07:18.949
Jesus said a zealous example

00:07:18.949 --> 00:07:22.949
in trying to help people put faith in the good news.

00:07:22.949 --> 00:07:24.949
Luke 8 verse 1 reports

00:07:24.949 --> 00:07:27.949
that he traveled from city to city

00:07:27.949 --> 00:07:29.949
and from village to village

00:07:29.949 --> 00:07:33.949
preaching and declaring the good news of the kingdom of God

00:07:33.949 --> 00:07:36.949
and the 12 were with him.

00:07:36.949 --> 00:07:39.949
Because of that fine example,

00:07:39.949 --> 00:07:42.949
those who learned from Jesus in the first century

00:07:42.949 --> 00:07:46.949
wasted no time in imitating his zeal.

00:07:46.949 --> 00:07:51.949
Acts 5 verse 42 tells us that every day in the temple

00:07:51.949 --> 00:07:55.949
and from house to house they continued without let up,

00:07:55.949 --> 00:08:01.949
teaching and declaring the good news about the Christ Jesus.

00:08:01.949 --> 00:08:06.949
And so we must also be eager to declare the same good news.

00:08:06.949 --> 00:08:09.949
Happily though, as we preach,

00:08:09.949 --> 00:08:16.949
we can add the fact that Jesus is now ruling as our king in heaven.

00:08:16.949 --> 00:08:20.949
What will help us to imitate Jesus' zeal for the ministry?

00:08:20.949 --> 00:08:23.949
Prayerful meditation.

00:08:24.949 --> 00:08:29.949
Jesus took time to pray and to ponder in private.

00:08:29.949 --> 00:08:32.950
He had observed that people were skinned

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:35.950
and thrown about like sheep without a shepherd,

00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:39.950
seeing people being maltreated and neglected,

00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:42.950
stirred Jesus' compassion for them,

00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:45.950
and the desire to help them.

00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:48.950
We also can compassionately reflect

00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:51.950
on how much the people in our territory

00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:54.950
need to hear the good news.

00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:56.950
And we can think about the fact that

00:08:56.950 --> 00:09:00.950
living as we are in the last days of this system of things,

00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:03.950
there's not much time left for people to respond

00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:06.950
to our preaching efforts.

00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:11.950
Many kingdom publishers find that praying and meditating

00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:13.950
even for a few moments,

00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:15.950
right before sharing in the ministry,

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:19.950
helps them to preach with greater zeal and boldness.

00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:23.950
It deepens their desire to serve Jehovah,

00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:25.950
sharpens their spiritual focus,

00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:28.950
and strengthens their determination

00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:33.950
to continue preaching regardless of the reaction they get.

00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:36.950
May today's program stir in you

00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:40.950
and even greater desire to proclaim the good news

00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:43.950
of salvation day after day.

00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:48.950
Now, please enjoy the continuation of episode 1

00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:52.950
of the good news according to Jesus.

00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:55.950
Part 2 centers on the second chapters

00:09:55.950 --> 00:09:59.950
of both Luke's Gospel and Matthews.

00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:02.950
Let's watch the conclusion of episode 1,

00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:05.950
the true light of the world.
