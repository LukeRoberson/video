00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:06.330
There is a saying that experience is the best teacher.

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.330
But that is not really accurate.

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.330
Experience is often the hard way to learn.

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:19.329
Brother Fernando Casillas was born in Mexico,

00:00:19.329 --> 00:00:25.329
but when he was a baby, his family moved to the United States.

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:32.329
The neighborhood he grew up in had a lot of gang influence.

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:36.329
This had a very negative impact on him,

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.329
but despite these circumstances,

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:47.079
notice how the truth attracted him.

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:51.079
I used to love violence. I dreamed of violence.

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:53.079
My gang was my religion.

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:56.079
I went into the prison system at a young age.

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:59.079
At first, they sent me to a juvenile facility,

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:01.079
but I got kicked out of there for a ride.

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.079
Basically, they deemed me a threat to the safety and security of the institution,

00:01:06.079 --> 00:01:08.079
the guards and other inmates,

00:01:08.079 --> 00:01:13.079
and were sent to solitary confinement to finish off my prison term.

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:18.079
Me thinking I was violent back then was nothing compared to what I came out with.

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:23.079
Basically, what you try to come out to be is the best killer out of all.

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:32.400
After my incarceration, I was deported to Mexico.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.400
I used to carry a weapon with me everywhere I went.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.400
After a while, we started getting involved with bad people.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.400
Eventually, my girlfriend got in trouble.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.400
Once that was over, she saw a kingdom hall.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.400
My girlfriend had been to meetings as a child,

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.400
so she basically dragged me to the kingdom hall.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.400
They treated me nice,

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.400
and that's when I started to get to know Omar.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.400
So I started hanging around with him and his wife,

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.400
me and my girlfriend at the time,

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.400
going to meetings,

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.400
but it wasn't until I found out this guy used to be one of my rivals.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.400
I was very, very upset.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.400
I'll be trade because he never told me.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.400
Everything that was going through my head was,

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.400
I got to find a way to get him over here so I can hurt him.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.400
After thinking about all the things that I wanted to do to him,

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.400
and I'd run into it through my head over and over again,

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.400
I decided to just stay friends with him.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.400
And eventually, we decided to start studying together.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.400
Being the way I was is I thought that there's no way

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.400
a God can forgive me.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.400
The scripture in Isaiah 557 really helped me,

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.400
where it says, let the wicked man leave his way

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.400
and the evil man his thoughts.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.400
Let him return to Jehovah, who will have mercy on him.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.400
It's time when by, I started understanding clearly

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.400
that Jehovah does forgive.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.400
By that time, I had already kind of made a decision

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.400
that I was done with doing time in prison.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.400
I just decided to cut all ties with everybody

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.400
that had anything to deal with anything illegal.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.400
It felt like a free person.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.400
And after progressing, including the habits that I had

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.400
of smoking and drinking a lot,

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.400
I became an unbaptized publisher.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.400
But my father passed away.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.400
I started hanging around with bad association again

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.400
and eventually I had my privileges removed.

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.400
And as that was happening, Satan attacked me again.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.400
So one day, my wife was crossing the border

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.400
to go take care of some paperwork for her, the kids.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.400
It was a surprise by the Border Patrol

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.400
telling her that there's drugs in the vehicle.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.400
We did not know that the previous owner

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.400
had stashed drugs in the truck.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.400
Even though later, they proved that the drugs

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.400
were not my wife, and she was released,

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.400
but they still decided to keep my kids.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.400
What I was thinking of doing was going back

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.400
to my old ways, organizing a plot with my old friends

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.400
to bring my kids back to Mexico to me.

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.400
But I decided to rely on Jehovah instead

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.400
and on the brothers.

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.400
Coming to visit me on a regular basis,

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.400
give me encouraging thoughts of how Jehovah

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.400
would take care of everything.

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.400
Eventually, our kids will return to us

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.399
with Jehovah's help.

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:19.399
After a little struggle, of course,

00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:21.399
I had my privileges back.

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:25.399
A few months later, I was baptized.

00:04:25.399 --> 00:04:29.399
I'm not happier now than when I was back then.

00:04:29.399 --> 00:04:32.399
One day, as I was preaching in the rehab centers,

00:04:32.399 --> 00:04:36.399
I ran into a person I once knew before growing up.

00:04:36.399 --> 00:04:38.399
Once he found out who I was,

00:04:38.399 --> 00:04:41.399
he says, you're the reason why I left town.

00:04:41.399 --> 00:04:44.399
Every time you would see me, you would shoot at me.

00:04:44.399 --> 00:04:47.399
So after a while, I was able to convince him

00:04:47.399 --> 00:04:51.399
that actually my purpose there was not to hurt him anymore,

00:04:51.399 --> 00:04:54.399
but to teach him the truth

00:04:54.399 --> 00:04:57.399
and how to gain everlasting life.

00:04:57.399 --> 00:04:59.399
I'm no longer a violent person.

00:04:59.399 --> 00:05:03.399
I enjoy the privileges that Jehovah now gives me.

00:05:03.399 --> 00:05:05.399
I have not been serving as a ministerial servant

00:05:05.399 --> 00:05:07.399
for the past two years.

00:05:07.399 --> 00:05:11.399
I am in charge of the accounting for the Kingdom Hall

00:05:11.399 --> 00:05:14.399
instead of stealing money as I used to do before.

00:05:14.399 --> 00:05:17.399
What I do for living is I do gardening work.

00:05:17.399 --> 00:05:19.399
Now, I don't carry around lives,

00:05:19.399 --> 00:05:22.399
but I carry around my tools.

00:05:22.399 --> 00:05:25.399
You could say that I did beat my pistols

00:05:25.399 --> 00:05:28.399
into plushers now, or weedwacker, or lawnmower.

00:05:28.399 --> 00:05:32.399
I'm glad that I'm now serving

00:05:32.399 --> 00:05:36.399
a great God who is loving, caring, and forgiving.

00:05:36.399 --> 00:05:45.550
Fernando and his family are serving

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:49.550
in an English congregation in Mexico.

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:52.550
With everything brother Cassias went through,

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:57.550
he could say that Jehovah is the best teacher.

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:00.550
If you listen to Jehovah,

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:04.550
you won't have to learn the hard way.

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:08.550
Jehovah is the one teaching you

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:11.550
to benefit yourself.
