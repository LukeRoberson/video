WEBVTT

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:09.169
We're very happy to have hundreds of thousands of children associated with our congregations

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:11.169
worldwide.

00:00:11.169 --> 00:00:15.250
You can be assured Jehovah loves every one of those children.

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:17.449
Well, how can we say that?

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:23.629
Well, one reason is that every child owes its name to Jehovah God because he's the

00:00:23.629 --> 00:00:30.250
originator of life and, in fact, the originator of the family unit as well.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:37.250
When Jesus was in heaven, he recognized and observed Jehovah's intense love for children.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:44.450
And when Jesus walked the earth, he reflected those same qualities towards children.

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:52.049
The Psalmist beautifully expresses Jehovah's feelings about children in the 127th Psalm

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:53.049
in verse 3.

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:55.210
And let's read that.

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:02.340
Psalm 127 and verse 3.

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.340
Jesus says, Look, sons are an inheritance from Jehovah.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.140
The fruit of the womb is a reward.

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:18.180
So not only are children a blessing or a reward, the Scripture indicates that they are an

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.379
inheritance as well.

00:01:20.379 --> 00:01:25.299
Yes, they are a gift to you from Jehovah.

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:31.780
A person who hopes to inherit something usually prepares to receive it and then takes good

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.420
care of it afterwards.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.819
I'm sure that's exactly what you parents want to do with your children.

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:44.579
While children can bring much joy, they can also cause frustration.

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:51.579
So the question is, How can you find joy in your children despite living in a stressful

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:55.019
world?

00:01:55.019 --> 00:02:01.420
One suggestion is to view your children the way Jehovah does.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.420
These are special gifts to you from Him.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.419
Love them, make them feel loved.

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:14.180
It's not enough for you to know you love your own children, they need to know it.

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:20.780
They will not know it unless you find ways to show your love to them.

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.740
And as with any gift, there's a responsibility to take care of it.

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:33.500
If we go back to the 127 Psalm, notice the illustration that King Solomon uses to explain

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.539
this responsibility.

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:44.509
It's in verses 4 and 5, Psalm 127, 4 and 5.

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:51.629
It says like arrows in the hand of a mighty man, so are the sons of one's youth.

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:58.800
Happy is the man who fills his quiver with them, they will not be put to shame.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:04.719
So children are likened to arrows and parents to mighty warriors.

00:03:04.719 --> 00:03:11.120
So a warrior will take the arrow and he will carefully aim it so he hits the target.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.840
What's the same with you parents?

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:20.719
We encourage you carefully direct your children in a way that, so to speak, you hit the target

00:03:20.719 --> 00:03:27.719
so your children can have a happy fulfilling life of serving Jehovah God.

00:03:27.719 --> 00:03:30.879
So what can help you to do that?

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:38.319
Pray to Jehovah to help you build and maintain a strong relationship with your children.

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:44.360
This closeness will help them to respond favorably to your good direction.

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:52.159
Yes, the way you treat your children is going to affect not only their future, but your happiness

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:54.360
as well.

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:59.520
Now there are five suggestions that might be of assistance and building and maintaining

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.639
this strong relationship with your children.

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:10.759
The first one, tell your children you love them, or you might say, well, that's not the

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:11.759
way I was raised.

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:18.920
Well, maybe not, but learn from the example of Jehovah God because Jehovah openly expressed

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:22.560
his affection for his son, Jesus.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:31.399
No matter how you were brought up, learn to express openly your feelings towards your children.

00:04:31.399 --> 00:04:39.720
One father said this, I have found that children are a bit like some flowers.

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:45.600
Just as these little plants turn toward the sun to receive light and warmth, children

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:54.579
look to their parents for love and for reassurance that they are welcome members of the family.

00:04:54.579 --> 00:05:00.300
They don't make your children have to ask you, Mom, Dad, do you love me?

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:01.300
No.

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:08.519
On a regular basis, let your words support the fact that you love them.

00:05:08.519 --> 00:05:15.839
Now another way to build a strong relationship with your children is to give them your time.

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:19.639
That's going to be a challenge in the world we're living in now.

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:24.079
But don't you think your children are worth meeting that challenge?

00:05:24.079 --> 00:05:30.959
It's going to require good organization on your part and maybe even making some sacrifices,

00:05:30.959 --> 00:05:34.079
giving up some things that you enjoy doing.

00:05:34.079 --> 00:05:42.800
But spend a lot of time talking to your children, eating with your children, playing with your children.

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:50.800
It's up to you parents to figure out how you can give your time to your children.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:06:00.319
A mother once asked her children, if you could have anything you wanted, what would you like most?

00:06:00.319 --> 00:06:06.920
All four responded, more time with Mom and Dad.

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:14.399
Yes, so show your children how important they are to you by spending time with them.

00:06:14.399 --> 00:06:19.639
But you know there's more than necessary just to physically be around them

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:22.759
that leads us to our third suggestion.

00:06:22.759 --> 00:06:27.600
Listen to your children and acknowledge their feelings.

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:32.560
So when communicating with your children, don't dominate the conversations.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.399
Let them talk.

00:06:34.399 --> 00:06:37.879
Listen carefully and respectfully.

00:06:37.879 --> 00:06:41.079
Try to understand how they feel.

00:06:41.079 --> 00:06:45.519
And when they express themselves and their emotions, their thoughts and sometimes

00:06:45.519 --> 00:06:51.560
and maybe in extreme terms, well, don't respond in a similar way.

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:55.000
Proverbs 16, 23 says,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.839
the heart of the wise one gives his mouth insight.

00:06:59.839 --> 00:07:07.519
So parents work hard at patiently trying to understand why your child feels the way they do

00:07:07.519 --> 00:07:10.560
and how you can be of help.

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:15.180
One father expressed the matter this way,

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:20.060
since Jehovah allows me to pour out my heart to him in prayer,

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:29.779
I think it is only fair that I allow my children to pour out their positive and negative feelings to me.

00:07:29.779 --> 00:07:36.100
Also, listen to your children and acknowledge their feelings.

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:42.699
Now the fourth suggestion that may help to maintain a strong relationship with your children

00:07:42.699 --> 00:07:47.220
is do not expect them to be adults.

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:50.500
Remember the Bible says, through use,

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:57.699
a person's perceptive powers are trained to distinguish between right and wrong.

00:07:57.699 --> 00:08:00.259
Well, that's going to take time.

00:08:00.259 --> 00:08:04.420
The Bible also speaks of the trait of the babe,

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:10.500
the foolishness of boyhood and the vanity of adolescence.

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:14.579
So as your children are going through these various stages,

00:08:14.579 --> 00:08:21.579
recognize their limitations and don't expect them to be little adults.

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:23.819
Now the fifth suggestion,

00:08:23.819 --> 00:08:26.860
when disciplining your children,

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:29.980
always show love and discernment.

00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:34.860
Now this is supported by Ephesians chapter 6 and verse 4,

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:39.740
because there it tells parents not to be irritating your children,

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:45.340
but to bring them up in the discipline and admonition of Jehovah.

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:49.019
Says no secret formulas are how to accomplish this,

00:08:49.019 --> 00:08:52.620
especially since every child is different.

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:58.059
So parents, we encourage you give thought to the manner of your discipline,

00:08:58.059 --> 00:09:02.220
always showing love and discernment.

00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:09.580
So there are five suggestions that will help you to build a strong relationship with your children

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:16.460
that will help them to respond to your good training.

00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:20.460
Now what effect will that have upon you parents?

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:29.100
Well, please read with me Proverbs chapter 23 and 24 and 25.

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:34.379
Proverbs 23, 24 and 25.

00:09:34.379 --> 00:09:39.179
It says the Father of a righteous one will surely be joyful,

00:09:39.179 --> 00:09:43.740
whoever Father is a wise son will rejoice in him.

00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:46.940
Your Father and your mother will rejoice,

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:51.259
and she who gave birth to you will be joyful.

00:09:51.259 --> 00:09:55.100
So the greatest joy that a parent can have

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:58.860
is to see their children turn out to be righteous

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:02.460
and wise servants of Jehovah God.

00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:06.940
It's going to take time and effort on your part to accomplish that,

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:11.419
but we encourage you don't give up on these precious gifts

00:10:11.419 --> 00:10:15.179
that you have received from Jehovah.

00:10:15.179 --> 00:10:18.299
Have you watched the following dramatization?

00:10:18.299 --> 00:10:23.580
Notice how the parents rejoice in their children.

00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:32.899
Thank you. I love you. I love you too. Show time.

00:10:32.899 --> 00:10:41.820
Him, I'm death. Got a shower before us then.

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:45.419
Girls, you need to finish the kitchen now. No, we don't have any time.

00:10:45.419 --> 00:10:49.980
We just got home. No discussion. No excuses.

00:10:49.980 --> 00:11:02.320
Now. Okay, thanks.

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:05.919
I did tell them to leave the kitchen spot with, didn't I?

00:11:05.919 --> 00:11:13.149
Yeah, they needed to hear that. True.

00:11:13.149 --> 00:11:23.870
It's just overall, they are. I know. I know.

00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:29.389
They were auxiliary pioneering during the circuit overseas visit.

00:11:29.389 --> 00:11:38.529
They really put themselves out for others.

00:11:38.529 --> 00:12:05.789
Including you. I mean us.

00:12:05.789 --> 00:12:12.220
Ever want to take them for granted?

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:15.820
Girls, I felt the big mess earlier.

00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:21.580
Thanks for cleaning that up. Your mom and I, we were upset,

00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:26.580
but we really want you to know that...

00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:28.820
You are gifts from Jehovah.

00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:34.500
Precious gifts. We both cherish. We love you very much.

00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:46.139
What your mom said.

00:12:46.139 --> 00:12:50.220
Did you notice how the parents rejoiced in their children?

00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:53.899
Even though the daughters needed some counsel and some discipline,

00:12:53.899 --> 00:12:57.340
it didn't overshadow all their good qualities.

00:12:57.340 --> 00:13:02.059
No, but these parents, they made comments like they never wanted to take the

00:13:02.059 --> 00:13:06.299
girls for granted. And they cherished these girls.

00:13:06.299 --> 00:13:10.220
In fact, they openly expressed that they loved them.

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:15.340
Now, it was apparent this family had cultivated joy.

00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:19.740
And we're confident that you as parents also are working hard

00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:23.100
at cultivating joy in your family.

00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:29.019
Some things that will help you is to be sure to tell your children you love them.

00:13:29.019 --> 00:13:32.379
Give them your time. Listen to them.

00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:37.820
I acknowledge their feelings. Don't expect them to be adults

00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:42.779
and train them with love and discernment.

00:13:42.779 --> 00:13:45.820
These suggestions are going to help you to

00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:52.059
aim your children to an everlasting future of serving Jehovah God.

00:13:52.059 --> 00:13:56.779
And as you put forth all this effort to assist your children,

00:13:56.779 --> 00:14:01.980
you'll be able to rejoice in them. These precious gifts

00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:08.100
that you have inherited from Jehovah. Brother Ronald Kerzan,

00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:12.820
a helper to the teaching committee, will now present the final talk of this

00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:17.059
symposium. Cultivate joy in your family.

00:14:17.059 --> 00:14:21.620
Young ones rejoice in your parents.
