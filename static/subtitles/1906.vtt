WEBVTT

00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:08.980
Welcome. In this program, we're going to talk about the importance of adapting as Jehovah's

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:17.179
chariot moves. But first, here are a few updates. Earlier this year, the governing body

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:24.179
approved for branch visits to resume during the 20-23 service year. The service committee

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:31.179
assigns governing body members to make shepherding visits on branches. It also assigns headquarters

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:38.420
representatives to visit branches. This is similar to when circuit overseers visit congregations,

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:45.859
except that the governing body members and headquarters representatives visit branches.

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:53.579
As of November 28, over 15 of these visits have already taken place this service year.

00:00:53.579 --> 00:01:00.380
These visits have resulted in tremendous interchange of encouragement for all involved and have

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:08.299
strengthened our unity. We've also heard positive comments about the special meetings with

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:14.859
pioneers that are held in conjunction with circuit assemblies. When Pioneer in New York said,

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:22.060
I attended the first in-person pioneer meeting and three years at the Queen's Assembly Hall today.

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:29.739
I couldn't hold back tears a couple of times because our father deeply understood what we went

00:01:29.739 --> 00:01:38.700
through during the pandemic. Jehovah is good indeed. No doubt, many of our pioneers around the

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:47.900
globe feel similarly. It's also encouraging to hear that the local design construction work is

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:54.540
moving ahead, where there are no government restrictions Kingdom Hall construction groups have

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:05.340
restarted. What theocratic construction is on the horizon? We now need over 15,700 new Kingdom Halls

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:13.099
and major renovations around the world. We need these Kingdom Halls for our in-person meetings.

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:21.180
To begin addressing these needs over 1,600 projects worldwide are planned for this year alone.

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:27.419
And branches are also working hard to prepare facilities for in-person circuit assemblies and

00:02:27.419 --> 00:02:34.620
theocratic schools starting in January 2023. Can you make yourself available to help with

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:42.060
theocratic construction? Ask your congregation elders for more information. It's wonderful to see

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.659
young people assisting with the work. Think of the training they're receiving now that they'll

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:55.500
be able to use during the great rebuilding work after Armageddon. We have another exciting update

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:04.219
regarding freedom of worship. As Jesus foretold at Matthew 10, 22, we face much opposition.

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:14.060
Jesus said, and you will be hated by all people on account of my name. To assist Jehovah's people,

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:20.620
we have recently established the Freedom of Worship Office at the Central Europe branch.

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:27.580
This Headquarters Department will coordinate our efforts to defend our worship in Europe.

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:34.620
Now, you might be wondering, the work has been established throughout Europe for many years,

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:43.740
so is this really needed? Yes, it is. For example, recently the government of Norway

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:50.379
decided that Jehovah's Witnesses would no longer receive certain state benefits that are provided

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:57.740
to all registered religions. Here to explain more about this is Brother Jagen Pedersen.

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:04.379
We were shocked when we received a letter from government authorities in Oslo, Norway

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:08.139
threatening to remove our registration as a religious community.

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:15.259
Jehovah's Witnesses have been actively preaching the good news in Norway for more than 120 years.

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:23.100
In fact, Jehovah's Witnesses suffered for their faith under the Nazi occupation of Norway during World War Two.

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:29.660
Commenting on how Jehovah's Witnesses were the only religious group who stood firm against the Nazis,

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:36.139
a previous minister for religion exclaimed, people throughout the country should know about this,

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:42.860
especially young ones would benefit from this information. We've always been known as good

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:49.980
citizens. In fact, a public report stated that Jehovah's Witnesses are careful to obey the laws

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:57.339
of the land. Now they've suspended our grants while there are over 700 religious communities

00:04:57.339 --> 00:05:05.660
who continue to receive such state benefits. This decision is unconstitutional and an unprecedented

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:12.379
attack on religious freedom in Norway. With the assistance of the newly established

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:19.019
Freedom of Warship Office, we're pursuing legal remedies. At the same time, we're pursuing

00:05:19.019 --> 00:05:25.500
dialogue with government officials and we pray that this situation will be amicably resolved.

00:05:27.019 --> 00:05:32.540
Thank you, Brother Pedersen. The authorities in Norway have threatened to

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:39.500
remove our legal registration because of our scriptural beliefs and practices regarding

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:46.939
disfellowshipping. In the future, various governments will challenge our freedom of Warship.

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:55.579
They may pressure us to change our scriptural beliefs, but we're certainly not going to do that.

00:05:57.259 --> 00:06:02.060
As Brother Pedersen mentioned, efforts are being made to address this issue.

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:08.379
In the meantime, please make it a matter of prayer.

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:16.709
At the beginning of the pandemic, many activities were quickly suspended.

00:06:17.589 --> 00:06:23.589
But now, as we're coming out of the pandemic, many activities are quickly resuming.

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:30.870
And this is no surprise because Jehovah's celestial chariot moves swiftly like lightning.

00:06:31.509 --> 00:06:37.269
Notice how this is described at Ezekiel chapter 1, verses 16 and 17.

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:44.550
Here, Ezekiel gets an awe-inspiring glimpse of the chariot. He describes it this way.

00:06:45.589 --> 00:06:50.550
The wheels and their structure appeared to glow like chrysalite, and the four of them looked

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:56.949
alike. Their appearance and structure looked as though a wheel were within a wheel. When they moved,

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:01.990
they could go in any of the four directions without turning as they went.

00:07:03.269 --> 00:07:09.189
What an amazing vision of the heavenly part of Jehovah's universal organization.

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:17.269
The pure worship book explains, Jehovah's chariot perfectly reflects the reasonable,

00:07:17.269 --> 00:07:23.430
adaptable God who is in control of it. As his very name suggests,

00:07:24.069 --> 00:07:28.870
he can become anything that is needed in order to accomplish his purpose.

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:35.350
Never should we worry that our God will be late in responding to our needs,

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:41.750
or that his organization will fail to adapt to some new challenge arising in the volatile world

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:50.470
around us. We do well to remember that Jehovah's organization is active ever on the move.

00:07:50.629 --> 00:07:55.750
We have certainly experienced the truth of these words during the pandemic.

00:07:57.589 --> 00:08:02.709
Thank you for the fine spirit you show as we all adapt to these changes.

00:08:04.629 --> 00:08:10.709
Earlier in the pandemic, we couldn't meet together in person, but as a result of faithfully

00:08:10.709 --> 00:08:16.470
following the chariot, we adapted and used video conferencing for our meetings in ministry.

00:08:16.629 --> 00:08:24.550
Thankfully, circumstances are different now. We rejoice to be able to meet in person again.

00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:31.910
Back in July, the governing body prepared an announcement that was read in all congregations about

00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:38.230
attending in-person meetings. Do you recall some of the key points from that announcement?

00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:45.190
The announcement began in reviewing the results of resuming in-person congregation meetings.

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:50.389
It is evident that Jehovah is clearly blessing this arrangement.

00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:56.470
We thank Jehovah for the opportunity to greet our brothers and sisters face-to-face,

00:08:57.029 --> 00:09:03.590
sing songs of praise to Jehovah harmoniously and make other appropriate expressions of Christian

00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:10.389
affection once again. After more than two years of not being able to meet together at our Kingdom

00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:18.070
Halls, we have renewed appreciation for in-person Christian meetings that lift our spirits and

00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:24.149
strengthen our faith during these difficult times. The announcement continued,

00:09:25.269 --> 00:09:30.789
we acknowledge that because of advanced age, infirmities or other circumstances,

00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:36.950
some may be limited in their ability to attend meetings in person. For such ones,

00:09:37.669 --> 00:09:44.549
please keep in mind the loving reminder at Hebrews 6-10. For God is not unrighteous so as to

00:09:44.549 --> 00:09:50.950
forget your work, and the love you showed for His name by ministering and continuing to minister

00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:59.590
to the Holy Ones. Jehovah will never forget you in your faithful service. You continue to show your

00:09:59.590 --> 00:10:05.669
love for His name as you regularly attend and participate in meetings on Zoom. And this is

00:10:05.669 --> 00:10:12.950
such an encouragement to the congregation. Now, some of us got used to doing everything on Zoom.

00:10:14.309 --> 00:10:20.950
I know for me only for Jehovah would I have done what we needed to do during the pandemic.

00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:28.710
As soon as we could, I was so happy to go back to the Kingdom Hall. There really is nothing like

00:10:28.789 --> 00:10:35.190
being together with our brothers and sisters in person. I appreciate that others can't,

00:10:35.909 --> 00:10:43.909
but I was happy to get back to the hall many feel the same way. Let's hear some of our brothers and

00:10:43.909 --> 00:10:52.730
sisters feel about being back in person at the Kingdom Hall. I was so sad when they announced that

00:10:52.730 --> 00:11:03.720
we would stop having meetings at the Kingdom Hall because of COVID. I felt trapped because I couldn't

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:12.870
go to the Kingdom Hall anymore to be fed spiritually. For two years, the faithful slave made arrangements

00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:23.259
for us to listen to the meetings over the radio. Since I did not have a radio, I went to different

00:11:23.259 --> 00:11:31.690
brothers' homes to listen to the meetings. Then, the elders arranged to start having meetings on Zoom.

00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:36.970
I do not have a smartphone, so I had to go to the homes of those in the congregation.

00:11:37.769 --> 00:11:43.049
Sometimes, after arriving, I would find out that their internet data bundle was used up.

00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:49.370
This made the pandemic very difficult for me. When I heard the news that the faithful

00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:55.610
and discreet slave decided to resume in-person meetings, I was just so happy.

00:11:58.889 --> 00:12:03.450
Now I can see the brothers and sisters that I had not seen during the pandemic.

00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:09.850
I am back to the Kingdom Hall. I am back where I can have my spiritual food the way I've always enjoyed it.

00:12:11.450 --> 00:12:18.889
To not be able to go to the hall was a challenge for me. It wasn't easy, but I appreciated Zoom

00:12:18.889 --> 00:12:25.210
because we kept being fed spiritually, and that was a blessing. But still, I missed the people.

00:12:25.769 --> 00:12:31.129
When I heard we're going back to in-person, I was so excited. I was like a child

00:12:31.129 --> 00:12:38.809
and going into a candy store. I was so excited. It was great. It really was energizing. You felt

00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:46.490
alive again. We all have challenges. We're tired. So, who doesn't need to be energized?

00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:52.409
We all do. And so, to come to the Kingdom Hall, there's no question. I am going to the meeting.

00:12:53.289 --> 00:12:58.409
You're with the older friends, even older than me, and younger ones,

00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:05.210
little children that come running up to you. That just brings joy to your heart, a smile on your face.

00:13:05.769 --> 00:13:10.809
And I think that's the experience Jehovah wants us to have as a brotherhood,

00:13:10.809 --> 00:13:15.610
so I feel more fulfilled by being at the Kingdom Hall. I'm happy.

00:13:17.909 --> 00:13:26.149
It's heartwarming to hear their expressions. We've received many positive reports about in-person

00:13:26.149 --> 00:13:31.110
meetings. For example, the Burundi branch recently wrote,

00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:39.350
the decision to return to in-person meetings has been a great blessing to our brothers and sisters

00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:47.029
in Burundi. Although they did what they could to connect virtually, the reality was that many

00:13:47.029 --> 00:13:55.029
just did not have the circumstances to do so. Since resuming in-person congregation meetings,

00:13:55.029 --> 00:14:00.629
our attendance has increased tremendously throughout the country. For example,

00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:06.789
in one congregation, the attendance was 140 persons when the meetings were held virtually.

00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:15.590
But after resuming in-person meetings at the Kingdom Hall, the attendance is now 227.

00:14:17.669 --> 00:14:22.870
Continuing with the announcement, we want to draw your attention to this one comment.

00:14:23.029 --> 00:14:29.269
After acknowledging those with advanced-age infirmities and other circumstances that

00:14:29.269 --> 00:14:36.950
may prevent them from attending meetings in-person, the announcement included this thought-provoking

00:14:36.950 --> 00:14:44.309
statement. On the other hand, some brothers and sisters, younger and in good health,

00:14:44.309 --> 00:14:51.669
have more favorable circumstances that may allow them to attend Christian meetings regularly

00:14:52.389 --> 00:14:59.590
at the Kingdom Hall. However, it has been observed that some have developed a tendency

00:14:59.590 --> 00:15:05.110
to attend meetings on a video conference when, according to their circumstances,

00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:11.269
they could be physically at the Kingdom Hall. That's what the announcement said.

00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:20.070
It's something we can continue to reflect on. The chariot is moving. We're getting ready for

00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:28.149
in-person circuit assemblies and regional conventions. So now is an excellent time to evaluate our

00:15:28.149 --> 00:15:36.789
attitude about in-person meetings. Again, we appreciate that some cannot attend in-person,

00:15:37.509 --> 00:15:45.190
but on the other hand, maybe some could? What will help each of us to honestly evaluate our

00:15:45.190 --> 00:15:53.750
personal circumstances? Well, the announcement drew our attention to three verses that express

00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:59.909
Jehovah's thinking on this important matter. Let's read just one of those verses at

00:16:00.629 --> 00:16:11.190
Psalm 22-22. I will declare your name to my brothers in the midst of the congregation. I will praise

00:16:11.269 --> 00:16:19.350
you how we cherish our opportunities to be in the midst of the congregation at in-person meetings.

00:16:20.789 --> 00:16:29.669
The announcement concluded by saying, strong faith and endurance are required to face deteriorating

00:16:29.669 --> 00:16:36.470
world conditions. So we take this opportunity to warmly commend you, dear brothers and sisters,

00:16:37.029 --> 00:16:46.309
for your faithfulness, love, and heartfelt desire to praise our glorious God, Jehovah. We love you

00:16:46.309 --> 00:16:53.590
very much. Our brothers and sisters in Ukraine have faced especially challenging circumstances

00:16:54.470 --> 00:17:02.149
when it comes to holding in-person meetings. Recently, approximately 100 congregations in Ukraine

00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:10.869
were approved to resume in-person meetings where it was safe to do so. The brothers and sisters

00:17:10.869 --> 00:17:19.269
responded enthusiastically. Notice some of their expressions which highlight the joy and benefits

00:17:19.269 --> 00:17:27.910
of in-person meetings. A sister, named Svetlana, says, when the announcement was read about the

00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:35.509
return to in-person meetings, the first thing I did was thank Jehovah in fervent prayer.

00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:43.990
Meetings at the Kingdom Hall refresh and give emotional strength. The hugs and conversations

00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:51.829
improve my mood and give me the needed support. This is especially the case after spending hours

00:17:51.910 --> 00:18:03.220
in basements and hearing bombs explode. Nadia states, I compare online meetings to rescue boats,

00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:11.539
helping us to stay afloat. Attending in-person meetings feels like being aboard a huge cruise ship.

00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:18.980
The war is taking an emotional and physical toll on all of us, but when I am in the Kingdom Hall,

00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:23.460
I forget about my problems, my worries, and even the war.

00:18:25.539 --> 00:18:31.940
Brother Stenna's love, who got baptized during the pandemic, without ever having attended a meeting

00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:38.339
at the Kingdom Hall, says, I am a modern person and found our Zoom meetings okay.

00:18:39.619 --> 00:18:46.019
But I did not expect that the atmosphere in the Kingdom Hall would be so overwhelming.

00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:52.660
I also find it easier to follow the presented material and to remember it.

00:18:55.079 --> 00:18:59.400
We're encouraged by the determination of our brothers and sisters in your crane

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:04.680
to attend in-person meetings despite the many challenges they face.

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:10.200
Their expressions echo the words of Psalm 122, verse 1.

00:19:10.519 --> 00:19:17.000
I rejoiced when they said to me, let us go to the house of Jehovah.

00:19:18.119 --> 00:19:22.920
What have we learned from this update? As we've seen from Ezekiel's vision,

00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:28.359
we must always be ready to adapt when Jehovah's chariot moves.

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:33.960
We do so not only by attending meetings and participating in the Field Ministry,

00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:39.079
but also by staying up to date with our spiritual feeding program.

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:47.799
By keeping pace with Jehovah's chariot, we show that we respect and have confidence in Jehovah.

00:19:49.319 --> 00:19:54.839
As a result, we enjoy what is stated at Psalm 29, verse 11.

00:19:56.039 --> 00:20:01.720
Jehovah will give strength to his people. Jehovah will bless his people with peace.

00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:09.799
Yes, by being part of Jehovah's organization, we share in the strength and peace
