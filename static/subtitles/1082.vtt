00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:04.240
Please take your seats.

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:11.339
We extend the warm welcome to all who accepted an invitation to join us for this convention.

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:19.440
Today, many have been persuaded that happiness can be found by pursuing material wealth.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.940
But do such riches bring true joy?

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.940
If not, what does?

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:32.939
A take note of the Bible-based answers and real life experiences presented in the following discourse entitled

00:00:32.939 --> 00:00:36.939
Enjoy riches without pain, how?

00:00:36.939 --> 00:00:41.939
This talk will be given by brother Jeffrey Jackson of the governing body.

00:00:41.939 --> 00:00:52.100
Brother Jackson, you have our attention.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.100
Do you want to be rich?

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.100
Most persons would immediately answer, of course I do.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:06.099
Because they think of being rich means that they will enjoy life and have happiness and contentment.

00:01:06.099 --> 00:01:09.099
But let's ask a second question.

00:01:09.099 --> 00:01:13.099
What are you willing to do to become rich?

00:01:13.099 --> 00:01:16.099
Now that's a lot harder to answer, isn't it?

00:01:16.099 --> 00:01:20.099
As you think about the importance of that question,

00:01:20.099 --> 00:01:24.099
let's read a very important warning that the Bible gives us.

00:01:24.099 --> 00:01:31.099
If you'd like to take your Bibles, please, and will turn together to the first book of Timothy,

00:01:31.099 --> 00:01:37.099
1 Timothy, chapter 6, and verses 9 and 10.

00:01:37.099 --> 00:01:39.099
And this is the warning.

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:45.099
But those who are determined to be rich fall into temptation and a snare,

00:01:45.099 --> 00:01:52.099
and many senseless and harmful desires that plunge men into destruction and ruin.

00:01:52.099 --> 00:01:57.099
For the love of money is a root of all sorts of injurious things.

00:01:57.099 --> 00:02:02.099
And by reaching out for this love, some have been led astray from the faith

00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:07.099
and have stabbed themselves all over with many pains.

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:11.099
Well that certainly is a very important warning, isn't it?

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:17.099
When we look at it, we see that below the Bible acknowledges that money is useful.

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:24.099
It highlights here the love of money, or in other words those who are determined to be rich.

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:27.099
And notice at the end, there are verse 10.

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:33.099
It says this can lead to persons being stabbed all over with many pains.

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:40.099
In other words, they have gained, but they also have pain along with it.

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:47.099
But there's something else that can cause problems for those who have a love for money.

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:54.099
They may sacrifice their health, they may sacrifice their family life, and even their standards.

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:58.099
But the Bible highlights yet something else that they need to be careful about.

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:03.099
And at this time, if we turn our Bibles to the book of Proverbs,

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:09.099
please turn with me to Proverbs chapter 28 and verse 20.

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:14.099
That's Proverbs 28, verse 20.

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:18.099
A faithful man will receive many blessings.

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:24.099
But the one hastening to get rich, or in other words in a hurry, he wants quickly to get rich.

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:29.099
What does it say? Well that person will not remain innocent.

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:36.099
And isn't that true? That many people steal, lie, cheat.

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:44.099
They even prostitute themselves, and others kill other persons just to get rich.

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:50.099
So truly, these are important questions for each one of us to think about.

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:58.099
But why does the Bible highlight so strongly this warning about trying to get rich?

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:05.099
Well one of the reasons is that the Bible highlights the deceptive power of riches.

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:11.099
Now you might be wondering, what does that mean, the deceptive power of riches?

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:14.099
Well maybe we could illustrate it this way.

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:18.100
Imagine you wake up in the middle of a dark night.

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:25.100
The wind is blowing strongly, the rain is falling heavily, and you start to worry about flooding.

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.100
Then you see that there's no electricity.

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:32.100
So you start to grow up around and you find the flashlight.

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:37.100
So all of a sudden you feel like you have some help because you can see what's happening.

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:42.100
But as you try to turn it on, there's no light.

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:46.100
So then you remember, I just bought some batteries.

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:51.100
And as you grow up around in the drawer, you find, here I've got a battery.

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:57.100
So you put them in with the hope that this will now give you light.

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:02.100
But the batteries are dead. Perhaps there's a problem with them.

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:06.100
That is the deceptive power.

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:11.100
You put your reliance on something and it doesn't help you.

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:16.100
Well in a similar way, money can have that same type of deceptive power.

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:20.100
We might look at it, we might think, yes, this will help me.

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:24.100
But what happens in times of trouble?

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:31.100
So the Bible helps us to see that money doesn't always give us the hope that we need in times of problems.

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:35.100
Let's just think about three different areas of life.

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:42.100
First of all, money doesn't automatically mean that we have genuine security.

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:49.100
I'm sure you'll agree, the more money we have, perhaps the more security that we need to have to protect it.

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:54.100
But if we think about this, the Bible clearly highlights the problem.

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:58.100
And this time, if you'd like to turn with me to the book of Proverbs,

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:02.100
but we're going to read Proverbs chapter 18.

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:07.100
So please turn there to Proverbs 18 and verse 11.

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:13.100
And notice this very interesting word picture that the Bible uses here.

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:17.100
The wealth of the rich is his fortified city.

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:23.100
It is like a protective wall in his imagination.

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:27.100
Now that is very thought provoking, isn't it?

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:33.100
Perhaps we could illustrate it this way, a person may pay a lot of money every month

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:38.100
for a security firm to care for his home and his family.

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:41.100
And each night, he may sleep very soundly.

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:46.100
But what if he found out later that this was a fake company?

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:48.100
There were no security guards.

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:50.100
He was just paying money for nothing.

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:56.100
That security would be only security in his imagination, wouldn't it?

00:06:56.100 --> 00:07:02.100
The Bible also highlights another aspect of this, and I'm sure you'll agree with these comments

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:07.100
in chapter 23 of the same book, the book of Proverbs.

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:12.100
Proverbs 23 and verses 4 and 5.

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:16.100
It starts with this very good warning.

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:20.100
Do not wear yourself out to gain wealth.

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:23.100
Stop and show understanding.

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:26.100
Now notice the word picture.

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:31.100
When you cast your eyes on it that is on wealth or money,

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:33.100
it's not there.

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:39.100
For it will surely sprout wings like an eagle and fly off into the sky.

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:42.100
Now I'm sure you've experienced that, haven't you?

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:44.100
Your paycheck comes.

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:46.100
You think, yes, I've got some money.

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:49.100
You turn your back and all of a sudden it's gone.

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:51.100
There's not enough money.

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:57.100
And in a bigger sense, in recent times we've seen how money can be devalued.

00:07:57.100 --> 00:08:03.100
How even precious commodities such as oil and gold can lose their value.

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:08.100
It reminds me a number of years ago someone gave me this bank note.

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:11.100
And looking at it and reading it it says,

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:19.100
I promise to pay the bearer on demand 20 billion dollars.

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:24.100
Well, in outward appearances it looks like I'm quite wealthy.

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:29.100
But you probably guessed that if I were to present this and demand payment,

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:35.100
I really wouldn't get much from it because this money has been devalued.

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:40.100
So in a similar way, just like the batteries that don't work,

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:46.100
money at times does not give us the security that we want.

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:51.100
Now a second area in which money can't automatically give us what we want

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:56.100
is with regard to happiness and contentment.

00:08:56.100 --> 00:09:01.100
Yes, money doesn't automatically bring happiness and contentment.

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:06.100
You've probably seen accounts of persons who appear to be very successful.

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:08.100
They're famous, they have money.

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:13.100
And yet when they're interviewed they talk about how lonely they feel

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:16.100
and how meaningless their lives are.

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:19.100
And that's exactly what the Bible tells us.

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:24.100
It mentions that someone who accumulates a lot of money

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:28.100
isn't ever really satisfied with what they've already got.

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:30.100
They want more.

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:31.100
Isn't that true?

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:34.100
We've heard accounts of persons one way or another

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:38.100
who have accumulated billions of dollars.

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:41.100
But they just keep on accumulating money,

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:47.100
even though they couldn't use all that money in 10 or 20 lifetimes.

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:53.100
The Bible also tells us that oftentimes a rich person stays awake at night

00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:56.100
worrying about his money.

00:09:56.100 --> 00:10:00.100
But you know there's another area that is even more important

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:03.100
than those first two areas of life.

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:10.100
And that is money cannot automatically bring God's blessings.

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:13.100
Now that's an interesting thought.

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:15.100
Why can we say that?

00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:19.100
Well let's look to the words of our Lord Jesus Christ.

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:22.100
These are recorded for us in the book of Matthew.

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:26.100
So please turn with me to Matthew chapter 6.

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:30.100
And we're going to read verse 24.

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:35.100
These words of Jesus were part of the Sermon on the Mount.

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:38.100
Notice what Jesus says.

00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:42.100
Matthew 6 verse 24.

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:46.100
Well that says it very clearly, doesn't it?

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:49.100
You see, we have to make a choice.

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:53.100
We can't serve God and riches at the same time.

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:57.100
So this would affect our services.

00:10:57.100 --> 00:11:02.100
We can't serve God and riches at the same time.

00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:07.100
We can't serve God and riches at the same time.

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:13.100
So this would affect our service and our love of God.

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:16.100
So looking at those three areas of life,

00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:20.100
we see that money can be like that dead battery.

00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:24.100
It doesn't necessarily give us genuine security.

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:28.100
It doesn't necessarily give us happiness and contentment.

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:33.100
And it can interfere with our relationship with God.

00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:35.100
Now let's look at a video.

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:40.100
And we're going to see in this video how two individuals are affected

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:48.840
by this love for material things or for money.

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:53.840
I thought happiness was all about money

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:56.840
and getting to buy whatever I wanted.

00:11:56.840 --> 00:12:04.539
I was really into fashion.

00:12:04.539 --> 00:12:07.539
I was always thinking about what I was going to get next

00:12:07.539 --> 00:12:11.539
and I didn't mind putting an extra overtime to get it.

00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:19.980
My day ended with me taking the last train home,

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:24.980
eating, and then bed at one or two o'clock in the morning.

00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:28.980
But this affected me mentally and physically.

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:33.980
I'd wake up in the middle of the night with panic attacks.

00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:36.980
I felt so lost and confused.

00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:46.009
Everything I'd worked for was for nothing.

00:12:46.009 --> 00:12:50.009
My motive for shopping was when and doubt by...

00:12:50.009 --> 00:12:57.090
I bought a lot of things, powerful motorcycles, a house, cars.

00:12:57.090 --> 00:13:03.429
I was totally absorbed in work and sometimes worked all night.

00:13:03.429 --> 00:13:07.480
I somehow made it to meetings.

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:11.480
But after they ended, I'd leave right away.

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:15.480
I didn't show interest in anyone, not even my wife.

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:18.480
All I ever talked about was work.

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:22.480
And I showed a real lack of consideration for my wife.

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:28.480
I was really blunt with her and there was a constant back and forth between us.

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:31.480
And we had a strained relationship.

00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:33.480
We weren't happy.

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:37.480
We just felt stress, stress, and more stress.

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:39.480
Everything seemed pointless.

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:49.899
What did we see in that video?

00:13:49.899 --> 00:13:55.899
You'll notice that both those individuals really enjoyed going after money.

00:13:55.899 --> 00:13:57.899
They wanted to be rich.

00:13:57.899 --> 00:14:01.899
But did they receive happiness and contentment?

00:14:01.899 --> 00:14:02.899
No.

00:14:02.899 --> 00:14:05.899
There were problems that came along with it.

00:14:05.899 --> 00:14:09.899
They gained some things but with pain.

00:14:09.899 --> 00:14:14.899
So considering all these factors we've just discussed,

00:14:14.899 --> 00:14:18.899
does it mean that it's wrong for us to want to be rich?

00:14:18.899 --> 00:14:20.899
Not at all.

00:14:20.899 --> 00:14:23.899
Now that may sound like a contradiction.

00:14:23.899 --> 00:14:27.899
But let's have a look at another scripture in the book of Proverbs.

00:14:27.899 --> 00:14:31.899
At this time we'll turn to Proverbs chapter 10.

00:14:31.899 --> 00:14:39.899
In chapter 10 verse 22, notice it talks about a different sort of riches.

00:14:39.899 --> 00:14:40.899
What is it?

00:14:40.899 --> 00:14:44.899
Well, let's read it in Proverbs 10-22.

00:14:44.899 --> 00:14:49.899
It is the blessing of Jehovah that makes one rich.

00:14:49.899 --> 00:14:52.899
And he adds no pain with it.

00:14:52.899 --> 00:14:58.899
Did you notice what is it that really brings us true riches?

00:14:58.899 --> 00:15:01.899
It's the blessing of Jehovah.

00:15:01.899 --> 00:15:07.899
Yes, the blessings that we gain from God are true riches.

00:15:07.899 --> 00:15:10.899
Because notice what it says at the end of that verse.

00:15:10.899 --> 00:15:13.899
He adds no pain with it.

00:15:13.899 --> 00:15:17.899
So it's gain without pain.

00:15:17.899 --> 00:15:20.899
But when we think about this, we might ask,

00:15:20.899 --> 00:15:25.899
how could we ever accumulate these type of riches?

00:15:25.899 --> 00:15:29.899
Well, our Lord Jesus Christ answered this in the Sermon on the Mount.

00:15:29.899 --> 00:15:35.899
And if you turn back with me to that chapter we already referred to, Matthew chapter 6.

00:15:35.899 --> 00:15:43.899
You'll notice here that Jesus describes to us how we can obtain these genuine riches.

00:15:43.899 --> 00:15:48.899
Matthew 6, 19 through 21.

00:15:48.899 --> 00:15:54.899
Stop storing up for yourselves treasures on the earth, where mouth and rust consume,

00:15:54.899 --> 00:15:57.899
and where thieves break in and steal.

00:15:57.899 --> 00:16:02.899
Rather, store up for yourselves treasures in heaven,

00:16:02.899 --> 00:16:08.899
where neither mouth nor rust consumes, and where thieves do not break in and steal.

00:16:08.899 --> 00:16:14.899
For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.

00:16:14.899 --> 00:16:17.899
Do we see what Jesus is telling us here?

00:16:17.899 --> 00:16:22.899
Not to just strive after getting material riches here on the earth,

00:16:22.899 --> 00:16:27.899
but notice he says that we should store up treasures in heaven.

00:16:27.899 --> 00:16:31.899
Now this is not talking about an offshore bank account.

00:16:31.899 --> 00:16:40.899
Rather, it's talking in a symbolic way about how we can build up as it were a good relationship with God

00:16:40.899 --> 00:16:43.899
by means of the things that we do.

00:16:43.899 --> 00:16:46.899
Yes, these are true treasures.

00:16:47.899 --> 00:16:50.899
But now when we think about the life of Jesus Christ,

00:16:50.899 --> 00:16:53.899
He lived by these things that He preached.

00:16:53.899 --> 00:16:58.899
He didn't try to accumulate all these material things in His life.

00:16:58.899 --> 00:17:04.900
No, He focused on serving His Heavenly Father, Jehovah.

00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:11.900
He wasn't distracted by greed or by some desire for personal fame and glory.

00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:15.900
No, He focused on building up these treasures in heaven.

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:21.900
You might remember, even at one time in His life, Satan the devil tried to tempt Him.

00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:25.900
Do you remember one of those temptations involved this very fact

00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:30.900
that Jesus resisted the desire to accumulate material things?

00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:34.900
Let's turn our Bibles this time to the Book of Matthew.

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:39.900
And we look at one of the temptations as recorded here by Matthew.

00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:45.900
It's Matthew chapter 4 and verses 8 through 10.

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:52.900
And here we told, again the devil took Him along to an unusually high mountain

00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:56.900
and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.

00:17:56.900 --> 00:17:58.900
And He said to them,

00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:05.900
all these things I will give you if you fall down and do an act of worship to Me.

00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:09.900
Then Jesus said to Him, go away, Satan.

00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:13.900
For it is written, it is Jehovah your God, you must worship.

00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:19.900
And it is to Him alone, you must render sacred service.

00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:28.900
So Jesus clearly rejected this temptation to accept from Satan all these riches and glories of the world.

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:32.900
His focus was on serving Jehovah.

00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:35.900
And that was the wise thing to do.

00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:40.900
If you stop and think about it, you see, if riches and the glory of the world

00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:47.900
are the very things that make us happy, then why was Satan willing to give all that away?

00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:52.900
Obviously, it hadn't given Him the happiness, He wanted something else, didn't He?

00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:59.900
Jesus selected the right thing to build up treasures in heaven.

00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:06.900
So if we worship Jehovah and obey Him, we can expect to get our lives enriched

00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:10.900
by these wonderful things that Jehovah gives us.

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:15.900
What are some of the symbolic riches we could say that we can again, even now?

00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:19.900
Well, let's think about five different things.

00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:23.900
The first one is in a well-known scripture in the book of Psalms.

00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:27.900
So please, turn with Me to Psalm 83.

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:33.900
Psalm 83, and we're going to read verse 18.

00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:44.900
May people know that you, whose name is Jehovah, you alone are the most high over all the earth.

00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:49.900
So what's the first of these things that can enrich our lives?

00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:51.900
It's knowing God.

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:55.900
You see, many people like to know the rich and famous.

00:19:55.900 --> 00:20:01.900
But just think of it, we have the privilege of coming to know the sovereign of the universe.

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:08.900
Yes, by learning about Him and getting to know Him, our lives truly become rich.

00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:14.900
Now, in addition to that, we become worshipers of Jehovah.

00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:22.900
And that includes us in a worldwide brotherhood, a brotherhood that comes from all sorts of nations

00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:25.900
and racial backgrounds and languages.

00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:33.900
And yet, even this global brotherhood is united in love, the love of serving Jehovah God.

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:37.900
So that's something that enriches our lives as well.

00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:42.900
A third point is that even though we're living in difficult times,

00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:47.900
when we follow the advice and direction given to us by Jehovah through His Word, the Bible,

00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:51.900
then we can attain a measure of happiness right now.

00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:58.900
For example, the Bible gives us advice on how to be good fathers and mothers and children,

00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:03.900
and that can add to happiness, love, and unity in the family.

00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:10.900
But something else that's important that enriches our lives, we have hope.

00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:12.900
Yes, hope for the future.

00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:16.900
Even though we're living in a world that's dominated by wicked people,

00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:20.900
the Bible tells us about what's going to happen in the future.

00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:23.900
Please turn with me back to the book of Psalms.

00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:29.900
This time we're going to read Psalm 37 and verse 22.

00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:32.900
Notice the promise that's given here.

00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:40.759
Those blessed by Him, that is, Jehovah, will possess the earth.

00:21:40.759 --> 00:21:45.759
But those cursed by Him will be done away with.

00:21:45.759 --> 00:21:51.759
So the Bible promises us that in the future there'll be a big change here on earth.

00:21:51.759 --> 00:21:56.759
And only those who love God will possess the earth.

00:21:56.759 --> 00:21:59.759
What a beautiful hope.

00:21:59.759 --> 00:22:04.759
Now the fifth point is the wonderful promise that the Bible gives us,

00:22:04.759 --> 00:22:10.759
that those who we love have already died will have the opportunity of being resurrected,

00:22:10.759 --> 00:22:13.759
or in other words, being brought back to life.

00:22:13.759 --> 00:22:15.759
Notice the promise of Jesus.

00:22:15.759 --> 00:22:19.759
It's recorded in John chapter 5.

00:22:20.759 --> 00:22:29.299
So please turn with me to John chapter 5 and verses 28 and 29.

00:22:29.299 --> 00:22:31.299
This is Jesus' promise.

00:22:31.299 --> 00:22:35.299
Do not be amazed at this, for the hour is coming,

00:22:35.299 --> 00:22:41.299
in which all those in the memorial tombs will hear His voice and come out.

00:22:41.299 --> 00:22:45.299
Those who did good things to a resurrection of life,

00:22:45.299 --> 00:22:50.299
and those who practice while things to a resurrection of judgment.

00:22:51.299 --> 00:22:54.299
What beautiful hopes these are.

00:22:54.299 --> 00:23:00.299
A hope for a change in the world, and a hope for those who have died to come back

00:23:00.299 --> 00:23:03.299
and live again in a paradise.

00:23:03.299 --> 00:23:08.299
Those are the things that can enrich our lives right now.

00:23:08.299 --> 00:23:12.299
So let's think back to those two individuals in the video.

00:23:12.299 --> 00:23:14.299
How could they change their lives?

00:23:14.299 --> 00:23:18.299
So instead of trying to pursue after material riches,

00:23:19.299 --> 00:23:22.299
they could achieve these true riches.

00:23:22.299 --> 00:23:29.799
Let's watch and see.

00:23:29.799 --> 00:23:35.799
I realized that I hadn't been caring for myself on the inside,

00:23:35.799 --> 00:23:40.799
so I decided to read the Bible all over again.

00:23:40.799 --> 00:23:46.799
I was especially moved by how Jehovah repeatedly tried to help the Israelites,

00:23:46.799 --> 00:23:49.799
despite all their failures.

00:23:49.799 --> 00:23:57.940
This reminded me that Jehovah had been expressing His love for me all along.

00:23:57.940 --> 00:24:00.940
I couldn't hold back my tears.

00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:05.940
I decided that I'd live the rest of my life for Him.

00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:14.589
I adjusted my work and made the ministry the focal point in my life.

00:24:14.589 --> 00:24:20.589
When I get to share a Bible scripture with someone and see it make an impact on them,

00:24:20.589 --> 00:24:23.589
I feel truly happy.

00:24:30.289 --> 00:24:34.289
I saw some brothers from the congregation playing soccer with a young boy

00:24:34.289 --> 00:24:38.289
who had just lost his father.

00:24:38.289 --> 00:24:41.289
They were trying to comfort him by spending time with him.

00:24:41.289 --> 00:24:46.339
When I saw them showing personal interest in someone

00:24:46.339 --> 00:24:50.339
and considering others' feelings, it really impressed me.

00:24:50.339 --> 00:24:55.339
And I thought, I want to use my time like that as well.

00:24:55.339 --> 00:24:57.339
A scripture in the Bible says,

00:24:58.339 --> 00:25:01.339
there is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving.

00:25:01.339 --> 00:25:04.339
The more I practiced it, the happier I became.

00:25:04.339 --> 00:25:08.339
I became convinced that this really is the truth.

00:25:08.339 --> 00:25:11.339
Now, when my wife and I spend time together,

00:25:11.339 --> 00:25:14.339
I am better able to really understand her

00:25:14.339 --> 00:25:18.339
and have come to realize how much she means to me.

00:25:18.339 --> 00:25:28.859
I am so thankful that Jehovah has taught me the truth.

00:25:28.859 --> 00:25:32.859
So how did these two individuals gain true riches?

00:25:33.859 --> 00:25:36.859
By focusing on serving Jehovah God,

00:25:36.859 --> 00:25:40.859
by telling others the good news about what's in the Bible

00:25:40.859 --> 00:25:43.859
and by sharing good things with others.

00:25:43.859 --> 00:25:50.859
Yes, if we've started in a life course that involves just looking for material riches,

00:25:50.859 --> 00:25:54.859
we too can change and follow their example.

00:25:54.859 --> 00:25:57.859
But what about the future?

00:25:57.859 --> 00:26:00.859
What true riches are ahead of us in the future

00:26:00.859 --> 00:26:04.859
if we continue to have a good relationship with Jehovah God?

00:26:04.859 --> 00:26:10.859
I'd like to turn your attention to a beautiful prophecy in the book of Revelation.

00:26:10.859 --> 00:26:15.859
Please, take your Bibles and turn to this book Revelation.

00:26:15.859 --> 00:26:21.859
We're going to look at chapter 21 and verses 3 through 5.

00:26:21.859 --> 00:26:24.859
As we read these words,

00:26:24.859 --> 00:26:29.859
imagine if you would please what a beautiful place the world will be

00:26:29.859 --> 00:26:33.859
when Jehovah God makes it into a paradise.

00:26:33.859 --> 00:26:39.210
That's Revelation 21, 3 through 5.

00:26:39.210 --> 00:26:42.210
With that I heard a loud voice from the Throne say,

00:26:42.210 --> 00:26:45.210
look, the 10th of God is with mankind,

00:26:45.210 --> 00:26:49.210
and He will reside with them, and they will be His people,

00:26:49.210 --> 00:26:52.210
and God Himself will be with them,

00:26:52.210 --> 00:26:56.210
and He will wipe out every tear from their eyes,

00:26:56.210 --> 00:26:58.210
and death will be no more,

00:26:58.210 --> 00:27:02.210
neither will morning or acry, nor pain be any more.

00:27:02.210 --> 00:27:05.210
The former things have passed the way,

00:27:05.210 --> 00:27:08.210
and the one seated on the Throne said,

00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:11.210
look, I'm making all things you.

00:27:11.210 --> 00:27:17.210
Also, He says, right for these words are faithful and true.

00:27:17.210 --> 00:27:20.210
What a beautiful promise this is.

00:27:20.210 --> 00:27:23.210
In other words, in the future,

00:27:23.210 --> 00:27:25.210
this earth will be turned into a paradise,

00:27:25.210 --> 00:27:27.210
and notice it says no more tears,

00:27:27.210 --> 00:27:30.210
no more morning or outcry,

00:27:30.210 --> 00:27:34.210
and also notice it says no more pain.

00:27:34.210 --> 00:27:38.210
These are the blessings that come from Jehovah God.

00:27:38.210 --> 00:27:42.210
But how will people feel at that particular time?

00:27:42.210 --> 00:27:47.210
Let's turn our Bibles to our final scripture in the book of Isaiah.

00:27:47.210 --> 00:27:50.210
Isaiah chapter 65,

00:27:50.210 --> 00:27:54.210
and we're going to start reading at verse 17.

00:27:55.210 --> 00:27:58.210
In the beginning of verse 17,

00:27:58.210 --> 00:28:01.210
it mentions about the new heavens and new earth,

00:28:01.210 --> 00:28:04.210
the Jehovah is planning to bring about.

00:28:04.210 --> 00:28:08.210
But notice the last part of verse 17,

00:28:08.210 --> 00:28:13.210
and the former things will not be called to mind,

00:28:13.210 --> 00:28:16.210
nor will they come up into the heart.

00:28:16.210 --> 00:28:18.210
What a wonderful blessing that is.

00:28:18.210 --> 00:28:20.210
That's something that money can't buy.

00:28:20.210 --> 00:28:25.210
In other words, no matter what traumatic experiences we've had in this life,

00:28:25.210 --> 00:28:28.210
no matter what pain we've experienced,

00:28:28.210 --> 00:28:31.210
those things will be healed.

00:28:31.210 --> 00:28:33.210
No more pain at all.

00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:38.210
What a beautiful promise from our loving Heavenly Father, Jehovah.

00:28:38.210 --> 00:28:42.210
And notice if we look down to verses 21 through 23,

00:28:42.210 --> 00:28:46.210
some of the activities that people will be engaged in.

00:28:46.210 --> 00:28:49.210
They will build houses and live in them,

00:28:49.210 --> 00:28:52.210
and they will plant vineyards and eat their fruitage.

00:28:52.210 --> 00:28:55.210
They will not build for someone else to inhabit,

00:28:55.210 --> 00:28:58.210
nor will they plant for others to eat.

00:28:58.210 --> 00:29:02.210
For the days of my people will be like the days of a tree,

00:29:02.210 --> 00:29:08.210
and the work of their hands my chosen ones will enjoy to the full.

00:29:08.210 --> 00:29:10.210
They will not toil for nothing,

00:29:10.210 --> 00:29:13.210
nor will they bear children for distress,

00:29:13.210 --> 00:29:18.210
because they are the offspring made up of those blessed by Jehovah,

00:29:18.210 --> 00:29:22.210
and their descendants with them.

00:29:22.210 --> 00:29:26.210
What a wonderful time that will be.

00:29:26.210 --> 00:29:30.210
And that can be part of the riches that you can attain.

00:29:30.210 --> 00:29:34.210
Yes, what should be the determination of each one of us?

00:29:34.210 --> 00:29:38.210
We don't want to strive after fake riches,

00:29:38.210 --> 00:29:42.210
riches that just give us gain with pain.

00:29:42.210 --> 00:29:46.210
Rather, let us strengthen our relationship with our Heavenly Father, Jehovah,

00:29:46.210 --> 00:29:51.210
and in this way we truly will reach out for the real riches,

00:29:51.210 --> 00:29:57.349
those that we gain without pain.

00:29:57.349 --> 00:30:03.349
Thank you, Brother Jackson, for identifying the riches that bring true joy.

00:30:03.349 --> 00:30:10.349
Around the earth, millions are learning how Bible teachings lead to genuine happiness.

00:30:10.349 --> 00:30:13.349
If you would like to have Bible discussions,

00:30:13.349 --> 00:30:16.349
free of charge at a time and place convenient for you,

00:30:16.349 --> 00:30:19.349
please inform one of Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:30:19.349 --> 00:30:26.349
or you might simply visit jw.org and fill out an online request for a Bible study.

00:30:26.349 --> 00:30:32.349
We will be happy to arrange for one of Jehovah's Witnesses to supply you with more details about

00:30:32.349 --> 00:30:38.349
how you can increase your knowledge of the Bible and its author, Jehovah God.

00:30:38.349 --> 00:30:46.069
What an encouraging session of Bible-based instruction this has been.

00:30:46.069 --> 00:30:50.069
We look forward to the thrilling finale in the next session,

00:30:50.069 --> 00:30:54.069
but now we invite you to stand if possible,

00:30:54.069 --> 00:31:01.069
and join in singing song number 84 entitled Reaching Out.

00:31:01.069 --> 00:31:07.069
This song reminds us of the joy that comes from helping others to draw close to God.

00:31:07.069 --> 00:31:11.069
Again, that song number 84.
