00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:09.519
Many years ago, I started working at a firm and I helped the sister to get a position at the same firm.

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:18.519
As time went on, I may have come to the wrong conclusion, but I felt that the sister wanted to be in charge.

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:21.519
I didn't feel very happy about it.

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:29.519
A few months later, I was retrenched from work. I felt very hurt.

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:36.520
My mother always told me to be the lesser one and just to let things go.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.520
So I kept quiet and I left the firm.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:48.520
Due to certain circumstances, we changed congregations, so we didn't see each other anymore.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:57.520
During those years, at meetings or reading the Bible, we are regularly reminded to be forgiving.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:06.519
It felt to me like a stab in my heart, because I knew we had to apply this counsel.

00:01:06.519 --> 00:01:15.760
Being at the convention, every time it made me a bit nervous.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:23.760
Because I basically had to prepare myself, should I bump into her, how I was going to handle it.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:28.760
It did ruin the spiritual atmosphere of the convention.

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:36.709
Soon after my mother passed away, we had our regional convention.

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:45.709
I was very emotional. I saw the sister standing and I wondered to myself what is going to happen now.

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:51.709
She came up to me, she gave me a hug and a small present.

00:01:51.709 --> 00:02:01.709
That particular day, I definitely felt relieved and I felt I could now make peace.

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:11.710
If both of us had applied earlier their advice given in Colossians 3 vs 13 by being forgiving,

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:17.710
neither of us would have had to carry this emotional burden for so many years.

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:27.750
Now I am very happy to say, Mona and I are good friends today.

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.750
We served together in the same congregation as elders,

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.750
and the relationship I have today with Louise is that we are friends.

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:41.750
But when we transferred it to the workplace, that beautiful friendship began to fade.

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:47.750
Well, as a builder, I'm old school and used to being in charge.

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.750
Perhaps I was too proud, but somebody couldn't come and tell me how to do certain things.

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.750
Since I was a crew leader, I said right from the start.

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.750
So, what is he doing here?

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.750
Does he have any right to an opinion about this?

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.750
So I made sure to push the brothers side completely.

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:12.750
I can remember that when I entered the kingdom hall through one door and I saw Brother Louise,

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:18.750
I would look for any possible excuse to avoid him, and I wouldn't even say hello.

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.750
Neither of us said hello.

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:28.750
For me, the internal battle between the fleshly minded person and the spiritual person was a very tough battle.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:35.750
It was like that for several years, and now I think I wasted time.

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:42.750
Something that would have helped me to maintain peace and unity with my brother would have been to be obedient to what Jehovah says,

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:48.750
to what the Bible says, to what we hear at the meetings.

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.750
Sadly, I wasn't obedient.

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:57.750
The lesson that I've learned from this is that Jehovah is always right.

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:03.750
In the exact moment when something happens, we should immediately act.

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.750
Carlos Henry himself was the one that then stopped me and told me,

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.750
we can't keep going on like this.

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:15.750
He took a very important step so that we could sort things out.

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:20.750
To be happy, you have to apply the principles you find in God's Word.

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:29.750
The words at Romans chapter 14 verse 19 encourage us to pursue the things making for peace.

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:35.750
What I would have done differently is that I wouldn't have let time go by.

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:41.750
Instead, I should have sought out the brother more promptly and restored that friendship again.

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:46.750
Although it's true that you can't recover time, you can recover a brother.

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:53.750
My relationship once again with Luis is that we are friends and he's a true friend.
