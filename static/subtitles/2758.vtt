00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:06.280
Hey, hobby.

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:07.280
Hey Ben, how you doing?

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:08.279
Good, how's the job going?

00:00:08.279 --> 00:00:09.279
Oh, machines running great.

00:00:09.279 --> 00:00:11.480
Ben, I did have a question on the specs for the Harrison job.

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:12.279
Can we take a quick look?

00:00:12.279 --> 00:00:12.779
Yeah.

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:16.339
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:00:16.339 --> 00:00:17.339
You need a hand?

00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:18.339
No, I'm good.

00:00:18.339 --> 00:00:31.609
What happened, guys?

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:33.609
We got to do something out.

00:00:33.609 --> 00:00:35.609
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:00:35.609 --> 00:00:45.030
Did...

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.030
I'm pretty sure that...

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.030
I would just say it's not working.

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.030
Whatever you do, don't tell Victor what happened.

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.700
We just got this set up last month.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.700
Why would it just stop working?

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.700
It could happen.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.700
Ugh.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.510
You can actually smell the coffee.

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:19.510
I'll talk to Victor.

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.010
Don't throw yourself under the bus, man.

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:23.510
We'll help you get this cleaned up.

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.010
No one will have to know.

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.510
This is one of the most expensive units in the shop.

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.010
You take the blame?

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:34.459
And you just make it yourself look bad.

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:36.459
No, it's okay.

00:01:36.459 --> 00:01:38.459
It was a mistake.

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:40.459
I'll explain it.

00:01:40.459 --> 00:01:42.459
We need to get this back online.

00:01:42.459 --> 00:02:15.500
In the end, I think Victor actually appreciated my honesty.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.500
And he wasn't the only one.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.500
Mark had some questions.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.500
And we had a great discussion.
