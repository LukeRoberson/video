00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.849
Jehovah design marriage is a beautiful and rewarding relationship between a husband and a wife.

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:13.849
When a husband and wife fulfill their God-given roles and they treat each other with love and respect,

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:17.850
their marriage is a wonderful and intimate friendship.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:25.850
A marriage that has good patterns shaped by Jehovah's principles looks like this well-balanced family circle.

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:31.850
But if a married couple over time has set bad patterns in how they deal with each other,

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:36.850
this is often the result. The life's going to be a bit rough for them.

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.850
Let's consider what Jehovah says about the roles of husband and wife,

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.850
and then discuss how love and respect are real keys to a happy marriage.

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.850
So what roles did Jehovah give to the man and woman in marriage?

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.850
Well, Jehovah places the husband as head of the family.

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.850
Ephesians 5.23 says a husband is head of his wife.

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.849
So that means the husband makes final decisions for the family,

00:01:06.849 --> 00:01:10.849
and his decisions will reflect his love for his wife, his children,

00:01:10.849 --> 00:01:15.849
and his understanding of their spiritual, physical, and emotional needs.

00:01:16.849 --> 00:01:23.849
At 1 Corinthians 11 and verse 3, we get a sense, though, of how Jehovah feels about the husband's role.

00:01:23.849 --> 00:01:27.849
And as we read this together, I want you to imagine Jehovah saying to husbands,

00:01:27.849 --> 00:01:34.849
yes, your head of the family, but I want you to know that the head of every man is the Christ,

00:01:34.849 --> 00:01:38.849
and in turn the head of a woman is the man.

00:01:38.849 --> 00:01:42.849
Sounds a lot like a father-in-law speaking to the groom.

00:01:42.849 --> 00:01:49.849
You can marry my daughter, but you better treat her good because you're responsible to me.

00:01:49.849 --> 00:01:53.849
Well, Jehovah is giving a very clear message for husbands.

00:01:53.849 --> 00:01:58.849
Jehovah will hold you accountable to him for how you treat your wife.

00:01:58.849 --> 00:02:02.849
It's something for us husbands to think about, isn't it?

00:02:02.849 --> 00:02:05.849
Well, what about the role of a wife?

00:02:05.849 --> 00:02:09.849
Jehovah assigned wives as a beloved partner to her husband,

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:12.849
and as partners, they can discuss important family matters

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:16.849
and work together to make their marriage a success.

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:19.849
Jehovah placed the woman under the headship of the man,

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:24.849
and as such, her role is to be in subjection to him.

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:28.849
At Ephesians 5 and verse 22, it says,

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:33.849
Let wives be in subjection to their husbands as to the Lord.

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:37.849
Subjection. Set a certain way, it almost sounds bad.

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:39.849
You have to be in subjection.

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:44.849
But is the subjection of a Christian wife to a Christian husband a bad thing?

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:50.849
No. See, subjection as described in the Bible is not about being subservient.

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:53.849
It's about her role in the marriage.

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:58.849
Your partners, each with a beautiful role to fulfill.

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:02.849
We could illustrate it with watching a couple ice skating.

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:05.849
As they move gracefully across the ice,

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:11.849
Do you think to yourself, how come they never let her hold him over her head?

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:14.849
Well, no, you look at him, you look at her,

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:18.849
it's obvious who should hold who over their head.

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:22.849
Well, just as we admire and respect a woman's role as an ice skating partner,

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:27.849
a husband deeply loves and appreciates his wife's role as his partner

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:31.849
as they work gracefully together to make their marriage a success.

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:36.849
Well, now that we've briefly reviewed the roles for husbands and wives,

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:42.849
let's read together a key scriptural principle at Ephesians 5 and verse 33

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:50.849
that shows how Jehovah wants husbands and wives to fulfill their roles in marriage.

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:54.849
Ephesians 5 and verse 33.

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:58.849
Each one of you must love his wife as he does himself.

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:04.849
On the other hand, the wife should have deep respect for her husband.

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:09.849
Well, the obvious message in this scripture is that husbands should love their wives

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:12.849
and wives should respect their husbands.

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:19.850
However, there's another way to look at this scripture and learn something about husbands and wives.

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:23.850
Jehovah God is telling us what each mate needs.

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:27.850
Men need respect and women need love.

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:33.850
Now, this is not to say that men don't need love and women don't need to be respected.

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:38.850
However, it does mean that men tend to emphasize respect and status

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:44.850
and women often emphasize intimacy, connection, and love.

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:53.850
This perfect principle can help us to understand why our husband or wife may act or feel a certain way.

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:58.850
Now, this difference in emphasis affects many areas of married life.

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:11.850
Let's consider three examples of how this powerful scriptural principle of love and respect can give us insight into how a husband and wife talk to each other,

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:16.850
how they solve problems, and how they act in the company of others.

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:20.850
Let's consider our first example, how they talk to each other.

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:24.850
Now, since a wife's emphasis is on being loved,

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:30.850
her conversations often stress friendship and connection when she talks to her husband.

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:36.850
She's eager to share the details of her life with him and in this way become closer to him.

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:41.850
She wants him in turn to share with her the details of his day in life.

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:51.850
Husbands, your wife feels loved when you learn to communicate with her in a way that tells her you truly care about her.

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:56.850
She places great emphasis on conversation and sharing her life with you,

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:00.850
and likewise you sharing your life with her.

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:06.850
For example, a wife tells her husband about something that happened to her that day.

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:13.850
He grows impatient with the story and interrupts or changes the subject or offers a quick solution.

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:15.850
How does she feel?

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:21.850
Why can't he listen to the whole story? Has he lost interest in me?

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:27.850
It's important that husbands give their wives their full attention as they speak.

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:33.850
After a long day at work, his mind may be focused on events that happen to him that day,

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:41.850
and he may, without realizing it, feel that the events or conversation of his wife aren't on important subjects.

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:47.850
So he may be inclined to play down the events in her life as unimportant or trivial,

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:53.850
while events he talks about are substantial and important because they happen to him.

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:57.850
Well, such a feeling over time can truly discourage a wife.

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:06.850
A husband's disinterest in her stories and events of her life feels a lot like disinterest in her.

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:11.850
The advice of Proverbs 20 and verse 5 is good for husbands.

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:15.850
It says, the thoughts of a man, or we could say in this case,

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:22.850
women's heart are like deep waters, but the discerning man draws them out.

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:25.850
That's great advice for husbands.

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:30.850
Husbands, when you draw your wife out, let her speak from her heart.

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:35.850
That's an indication of great love and affection for your dear wife.

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:40.850
Men, on the other hand, often view conversation differently.

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:43.850
A husband comes home and his wife asks, how was your day?

00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:46.850
He says, it was okay, nothing special.

00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:49.850
But later than at night, when they're with a group of friends,

00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:52.850
he tells a story about what happened at work.

00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:58.850
And she wonders, well, why didn't he tell me that when I asked about his day?

00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:04.850
Well, since a man's emphasis is on respect, they often use conversation

00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:07.850
to establish respect and status with others.

00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:10.850
A husband may feel that his wife already respects him,

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:13.850
so there's no need to tell her the story.

00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:18.850
Wives, you can encourage your husband to share his life with you

00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:21.850
by being interested in his work and activities.

00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:25.850
If you tell him, don't talk to me about all that work stuff with me,

00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:30.850
he won't, and you'll cut yourself off from a part of his life.

00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:33.850
Show him you're proud of what he does to support the family.

00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:37.850
Be interested in what happened to him, how he feels about things

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:39.850
or challenges that he overcame.

00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:43.850
While you may not find his work all that interesting,

00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:46.850
remember, it is important to him.

00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:51.850
Let's consider our second example, how they solve problems.

00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:54.850
Now, I want you to imagine a husband and wife, they're in a car,

00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:57.850
they're looking for an address, and they're lost.

00:08:57.850 --> 00:09:02.850
And the wife suggests that they ask someone for directions.

00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:05.850
She's thinking, why won't he ask?

00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:09.850
He's thinking, why can't he just let me find it?

00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:13.850
You see, since the man's emphasis is on respect,

00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:17.850
he's trying to avoid looking lost to a stranger.

00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:21.850
The act of asking someone else for directions

00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:24.850
may make him feel like he's in a lower position.

00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:27.850
Finding their way is a challenge to him,

00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:31.850
and he wants to show his wife that he can find it on his own.

00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:34.850
For the woman, such an idea may not come to mind.

00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:37.850
She may view it as a simple interchange between them and a stranger.

00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:41.850
They get help in directions, and they find out where they're going.

00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:46.850
At 1 Corinthians chapter 7 and verse 33, Jehovah tells us,

00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:52.850
but the married man is anxious, how he may gain the approval of his wife.

00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:57.850
Wives your husband is anxious to have your approval and respect.

00:09:57.850 --> 00:10:00.850
But on balance, husbands have to be careful

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:04.850
that an emphasis on respect doesn't become unreasonable.

00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:08.850
It won't hurt us to ask for directions or help at times.

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:11.850
On the other hand, a wife needs to be careful

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:15.850
that she doesn't show impatience by her words or tone

00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:18.850
as her husband works his way through a problem.

00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:21.850
A wife who clearly understands her husband's desire

00:10:21.850 --> 00:10:25.850
to solve problems for the family will understand his actions

00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:28.850
and will do her part to support him,

00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:31.850
even in the little things around the home.

00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:34.850
Now this support, in the little areas of life,

00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:37.850
builds his confidence in her support

00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:43.850
and can be a major factor in whether a husband takes the lead in larger matters.

00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:46.850
Our third and final example,

00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:49.850
how they act in front of others.

00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:53.850
Have you ever seen a couple where one of them is telling a story

00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:57.850
and the other is constantly correcting the details

00:10:57.850 --> 00:11:00.850
or the husband is trying to give some direction

00:11:00.850 --> 00:11:03.850
and the wife corrects or challenges the direction?

00:11:03.850 --> 00:11:07.850
Or the husband is telling others some unflattering story

00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:10.850
that hurts his wife's feelings.

00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:16.850
How can Ephesians 533 help a wife in these situations?

00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:19.850
Well, since a husband's emphasis is on respect,

00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:25.850
he'll be much more sensitive to comments his wife may make in front of others.

00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:28.850
It can hurt a husband deeply

00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:32.850
when his wife openly challenges him in front of others.

00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:38.850
Proverbs 31 and verse 12 has this advice for wives.

00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:44.850
She rewards him with good, not bad, all the days of her life.

00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:47.850
So when in public or when others are around,

00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:49.850
even close family and children,

00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:53.850
try not to openly disagree with him, correct him,

00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:56.850
or attempt to take over what he's doing.

00:11:56.850 --> 00:11:59.850
How you speak to your husband in front of others

00:11:59.850 --> 00:12:03.850
is a great way to show your deep respect for him.

00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:06.850
It also builds respect for him and others,

00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:10.190
including any children in the family.

00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:16.190
Well, how can Ephesians 533 help a husband act in front of others?

00:12:16.190 --> 00:12:18.190
Well, when in public,

00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:24.190
husbands will want to act like the husband in Proverbs 31 and verse 28.

00:12:24.190 --> 00:12:29.190
It says her husband rises up and praises her.

00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:32.190
It's common today for husbands to make fun of,

00:12:32.190 --> 00:12:36.190
or even say demeaning things about their wives.

00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:40.190
But since a wife places so much emphasis on connection and friendship,

00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:45.190
she can really be hurt when demeaning remarks are said to get a laugh.

00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:47.190
It makes her feel awful.

00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:51.190
Husbands, your wife considers you her best friend,

00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:53.190
the one she shares everything with.

00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:58.190
If you break that trust, she feels unloved and hurt.

00:12:58.190 --> 00:13:02.190
Now, the best time to bring matters to each other's attention

00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:04.190
is when you're in private,

00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:06.190
or if needed, when you can talk in such a way

00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:09.190
that others cannot hear what's being said.

00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:14.190
In this way, a wife shows deep respect for her husband

00:13:14.190 --> 00:13:18.700
and the husband shows his love for his wife.

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:22.700
So in review, we've considered just three situations

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:28.700
that the principle of love and respect can help us to have a successful marriage,

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:31.700
how husband and wife talk to each other,

00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:33.700
how they solve problems,

00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:37.700
and how they act in the company of others.

00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:39.700
A good marriage is hard work.

00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:42.700
How was your marriage?

00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:45.700
Would you say that you've developed good patterns

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:48.700
or bad patterns in dealing with each other?

00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:51.700
When was the last time you talked as a couple

00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:55.700
about love and respect for each other?

00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:59.700
Jehovah's perfect advice at Ephesians 533

00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:04.700
can help the marriage of two imperfect people.

00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:06.700
In just a few words in this verse,

00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:08.700
Jehovah is sharing with us a key principle

00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:10.700
of how he designed marriage.

00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:15.700
He's telling us what each needs and places emphasis on.

00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:18.700
Husbands put emphasis on being respected

00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:22.700
and wives put emphasis on being loved.

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:25.700
And this principle forms a key part

00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:28.700
of the divine pattern for marriage.

00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:33.700
If you want your marriage to operate as Jehovah designed,

00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:38.700
then work hard to apply his perfect principle of love

00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:41.700
and respect in your marriage.
