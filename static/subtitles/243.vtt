My name is Marcus I've got a good life and a good family but lately I'm really

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:27.050
having a tough time. Mom was baptized a few years ago as one of Jehovah's

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:32.189
witnesses. She studies the Bible with me and the two of us go to meetings and

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:42.689
out in the ministry together but I'm being pulled in other directions. My dad

00:00:42.689 --> 00:00:47.909
owns his own business and he takes care of us. He's always telling me success

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:53.090
as security. He seems pretty sure that sports and going to college will

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:59.740
prepare me for the real world. He's not a witness and I'm not always

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:05.579
sure how he feels about my Bible study. I guess we've avoided talking about it.

00:01:05.579 --> 00:01:14.379
My brother Todd and I used to hang out a lot but he doesn't have much time for

00:01:14.379 --> 00:01:21.500
me anymore especially when Amy calls. He says if I get baptized I won't be allowed

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:29.250
to have any fun. My cousins live two doors down for years they'd come back after

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:37.290
school but lately they've been into some stuff that I know was wrong. It's hard to

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:48.239
say no. I was starting to get really confused. My household was divided and

00:01:48.239 --> 00:02:06.739
so was I. My tough day was about to get worse. It was meeting it for mom and I but dad

00:02:06.739 --> 00:02:13.500
wanted me to stay for a big party with his family. I hate feeling like I

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:22.169
constantly disappoint him. As it turned out Jeremy was visiting for the first

00:02:22.169 --> 00:02:27.669
time since going to Bethel. Mom said that his family was just like ours and

00:02:27.669 --> 00:02:33.789
that his decision to serve Jehovah took courage. He wrote a scripture from

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:39.969
1 Peter chapter 5 humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God so

00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:46.930
that he may exalt you in due time. I thought about it but I guess I didn't

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:53.430
really understand what he was saying. That weekend Jeremy asked her work with me

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:59.310
in field service. We talked more about how 1 Peter chapter 5 helped him decide

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:05.509
what to do. His heart was divided but he said that humbling himself met doing

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:10.590
God's will and then trusting that Jehovah could make his heart catch up later.

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:17.509
He knew Jehovah cared for him and that there were only two choices. Jehovah's

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:24.750
way or Satan's. Then he read verse 9 to me but take your stand against him

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:34.580
firm in the faith and he asked me to do two things when I got home. First he said

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:40.699
I should pray about my situation and second he said that I should try and think

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:50.400
of a Bible character who took a stand for Jehovah Timothy took a stand and chose

00:03:50.400 --> 00:04:00.389
spiritual goals. Explaining that to his father would have taken courage talking

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:09.020
to my dad would be tough just another time he'd be disappointed in me but Timothy's

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:14.659
example and Jeremy's encouragement helped me realize exactly what I had to do.

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:24.600
It wasn't easy dad loves me but I know he doesn't fully understand my choice but

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:30.079
I explained how my Bible study has already helped me at school I've been offered

00:04:30.079 --> 00:04:37.560
drugs approached by girls tempted to fight but I've resisted it all and that made

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:48.829
that think I know that won't be our last conversation but it's a start I know

00:04:48.829 --> 00:04:54.910
which way to go now I've chosen Jehovah's way and my heart is no longer

00:04:54.910 --> 00:05:01.910
divided and I'm convinced Jehovah is with me.
