WEBVTT

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:16.679
We were at the meeting of our congregation in the city of Aurel.

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:20.679
But then one of our ministerial servants came running to me and said,

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:22.679
Dennis, you have to go in the hallway.

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:29.679
Okay, okay, I went then in the corridor and there were people standing there in masks.

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:34.679
A lot of police officers and a lot of FSB people.

00:00:34.679 --> 00:00:38.679
They showed their ideas and said that they were going to search our hall.

00:00:38.679 --> 00:00:44.859
I certainly didn't know exactly what to do in that situation.

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:47.859
I mean, this is the first time for me.

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:51.859
But I know one thing that I'm an elder in this congregation.

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:56.859
I'm the shepherd of my brothers and sisters and I must keep them safe and try to keep them calm.

00:00:56.859 --> 00:01:01.859
And then I was sure that the situation would be resolved sooner or later.

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:05.859
They behaved very rudely at first.

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:10.859
But then after a few minutes, they completely calmed down,

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:16.859
sat there in the front row and looked at me with very strange faces as if they said,

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:19.859
look, what are we even doing here?

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:23.859
Here are grandmothers, women and children.

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:29.579
Well, it's all peaceful and quiet.

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.579
I was sure everything was legal on our part.

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.579
When they told me, so, Dennis, we'll take you in for two days.

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:39.579
I thought, well, it's no big deal.

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:41.579
It's going to be resolved.

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.579
Two days is something I can live with.

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:46.579
Other brothers and sisters were in prison before me.

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:48.579
And I could do it too.

00:01:48.579 --> 00:02:00.450
And I was sure too that Jehovah was protecting me.

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.450
I think it was 11 o'clock in the evening.

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.450
They took me to the cell.

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.450
I arrived in my suit.

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.449
I had a jacket, a tie, a shirt.

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:16.449
And you might say that the other prisoners looked at me like I was from the moon.

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:18.449
I didn't know what lay ahead of me.

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:21.449
I also have no experience of being in prison.

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:25.449
But I decided that, okay, I need to take the first step.

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:30.449
Then I came to the other prisoners and said, hello, my name is Dennis.

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:38.680
The hardest part was being separated from my wife, Irina.

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.680
I was really worried about her health.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.680
Does she have what she needs materially?

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.680
Are they hounding her as well?

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.680
Would she end up next to me in prison?

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.680
A lot of thoughts were on my mind.

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:01.530
And that's why the first two months were the hardest for me.

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:07.530
The detention center is located so that you can't generally see the prisoners, right?

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.530
I tried to find a place where I could see his window.

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.530
And just from his window, he could see me well.

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.530
And so we agreed that I would go there.

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.969
Dennis told me what time.

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:24.969
That was my favorite time.

00:03:24.969 --> 00:03:26.969
You might say of the whole day.

00:03:26.969 --> 00:03:29.969
I was looking forward to 1 pm.

00:03:29.969 --> 00:03:31.969
My opportunity to see Irina.

00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:35.969
It was only five to ten minutes.

00:03:35.969 --> 00:03:39.969
For two years, we had this routine.

00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:42.969
Irina came every day.

00:03:42.969 --> 00:03:52.969
In the snow, in the rain, bright sunshine, no matter what the weather was, every day she was there.

00:03:52.969 --> 00:03:57.969
It was our little secret, which we reveal now.

00:03:57.969 --> 00:04:02.969
For two years, we didn't tell it to anyone at all.

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:07.759
He used to write me really funny letters.

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:13.759
Draw some funny drawings to make me laugh a little bit and cheer me up.

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:19.759
Because we are that sort of family that we are always laughing and making jokes.

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:23.759
I really tried my best to be a good husband.

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:29.759
When I was in the detention center, I tried to call her twice a month.

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:38.019
I tried to write her letters five times a week.

00:04:38.019 --> 00:04:44.019
I would be thinking beforehand all day before the call about what I want to tell my wife.

00:04:44.019 --> 00:04:47.019
What do we want to talk about on the phone?

00:04:47.019 --> 00:04:49.019
What are interesting topics?

00:04:49.019 --> 00:04:51.019
What funny things happened to me?

00:04:51.019 --> 00:04:53.970
What good things?

00:04:53.970 --> 00:05:03.970
I wanted my dear Irina to feel that she was the most beloved wife on earth.

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:08.970
I wrote about different spiritual questions that I read in the Bible.

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:10.970
I wrote a little bit about love.

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:15.079
I mean, that's important.

00:05:15.079 --> 00:05:19.079
But that's also why, in principle, it turned out where we will.

00:05:19.079 --> 00:05:26.379
I had friends supporting me, coming over, visiting.

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:30.379
I got a lot of letters and so did Denis.

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:32.379
They were people who said,

00:05:32.379 --> 00:05:36.379
whenever you are having a hard time, you can call and text,

00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:37.379
we'll come over.

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:39.379
We could go on a walk with you.

00:05:39.379 --> 00:05:43.379
We could take you shopping so you wouldn't feel lonely.

00:05:43.379 --> 00:05:47.379
They offered all sorts of help and I'm very grateful to them.

00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:51.379
And they were even sisters who cooked for me.

00:05:51.379 --> 00:06:00.680
It was a very great encouragement to me when the brothers in the congregation prayed for my husband and also for me.

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:05.680
They asked that Jehovah would give us the strength to endure everything

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:10.680
that we would be able to keep our joy in spite of this situation.

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.680
And that was very nice.

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:16.680
I felt that they cared for me personally.

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:20.680
I was very worried about my pioneer ministry

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:24.680
because I was so busy with different matters.

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:28.680
I didn't know how I could find time for the ministry.

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.680
So I talked to Jehovah about this,

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.680
that I wanted to continue to pioneer.

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:36.680
And he answered my prayers in a very interesting way.

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:41.680
The best preaching territory I've ever had was the detention center.

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:44.680
I met a lot of interesting people there,

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:48.680
because I spent hours waiting in line to leave food for my husband.

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:51.680
Sometimes two, three or four hours.

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:54.680
The longest I waited was five and a half hours.

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:58.680
So I had the opportunity to talk to different people.

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:01.680
And people came not only from Adol,

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:06.680
but also from different cities, villages, and even countries.

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:12.680
And it was unique, because many people had never even heard of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:17.680
And I was very grateful to Jehovah for giving me the opportunity

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:20.680
to serve him even in such circumstances.

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:23.680
I understood that Jehovah truly understood me,

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:28.680
understood my needs, so much that he fulfilled all my desires.

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:33.680
Even in the smallest detail, he understands what is important to me,

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:40.699
what is valuable, and he is ready to provide it for me.

00:07:40.699 --> 00:07:43.699
It's early spring, it's still cold,

00:07:43.699 --> 00:07:46.699
and there are no leaves on the trees yet.

00:07:46.699 --> 00:07:52.699
There is still this dirty snow, and somehow I don't like this time.

00:07:52.699 --> 00:07:56.699
I remember looking out the window and talking to Jehovah.

00:07:56.699 --> 00:07:59.699
I said, Jehovah, somehow I feel sad.

00:07:59.699 --> 00:08:03.699
I want something beautiful, I want beauty.

00:08:03.699 --> 00:08:08.699
Well, I talked to Jehovah, and the next day, one of the sisters

00:08:08.699 --> 00:08:13.699
from our congregation came and gave me a big bouquet of flowers.

00:08:13.699 --> 00:08:17.699
And interestingly enough, that wasn't the only gift,

00:08:17.699 --> 00:08:20.699
because as soon as those flowers wilted,

00:08:20.699 --> 00:08:22.699
another sister brought the next bouquet.

00:08:22.699 --> 00:08:26.699
And this went on until it was beautiful outside,

00:08:26.699 --> 00:08:28.699
when the leaves were already blooming,

00:08:28.699 --> 00:08:34.779
when the flowers in the front gardens were blossoming.

00:08:34.779 --> 00:08:38.779
I viewed my time in prison, and in the colony,

00:08:38.779 --> 00:08:41.779
as my assignment from Jehovah.

00:08:41.779 --> 00:08:45.779
I was sent there not only to serve my sentence,

00:08:45.779 --> 00:08:51.779
I was sent there to preach, to talk about Jehovah,

00:08:51.779 --> 00:08:56.779
about the Bible, about Jesus, about the kingdom of God

00:08:56.779 --> 00:08:59.779
to other people who may be couldn't listen at home,

00:08:59.779 --> 00:09:02.779
because they're in prison.

00:09:02.779 --> 00:09:07.779
I decided right away that sadness and discouragement were not for me.

00:09:07.779 --> 00:09:11.779
Well, it's not the best place on earth to be in prison, right?

00:09:11.779 --> 00:09:13.779
It really, really isn't.

00:09:13.779 --> 00:09:16.779
But people live here too, and life goes on.

00:09:16.779 --> 00:09:18.779
With the help of Jehovah, his spirit,

00:09:18.779 --> 00:09:23.779
it's also possible here to experience peace and joy of heart to be happy.

00:09:23.779 --> 00:09:30.620
Doing the court sessions,

00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:33.620
I tried really hard to show the brothers and sisters

00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:37.620
that came to support me, that I was doing well.

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:43.620
And so, yes, I often talk to them in the court, smile at them.

00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:49.620
Sometimes, I also showed the children's drawings that I had.

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:54.620
I really wanted to strengthen and encourage them,

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:58.620
so that they could understand that, yes, Jehovah is with me,

00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:00.620
and if something happens to other people,

00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:05.620
our brothers and sisters, yes, they shouldn't be afraid.

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:09.620
Dear brothers and sisters, I really appreciate your support.

00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:13.620
I'm very happy for open your letters, for all your thoughts,

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:15.620
for all your prayers.

00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:17.620
I really appreciate it a lot.

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:19.620
I try to do my best,

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:22.620
and I try to show Jehovah the best way that I could.

00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:25.620
I will do that forever.

00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:29.620
And I also really liked my husband's attitude,

00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:32.620
that he was a real shepherd to the sheep.

00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:35.620
Because those people who came to the hearings,

00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:40.620
they would live in such good spirits, uplifted.

00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:44.620
And they would tell everybody how interesting it was in court.

00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:47.620
And so, they kind of energized other people

00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:51.620
and encouraged them to come to the hearings.

00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:56.620
I started praying diligently about learning to love my enemies.

00:10:56.620 --> 00:11:01.620
Because now I had to communicate a lot with the investigative committee,

00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:04.620
with the FSB, with the courts,

00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:07.620
with the employees of the detention center.

00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:12.620
And this is the kind of place where people are not very friendly.

00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:15.620
It's amazing how Jehovah answered this prayer.

00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:20.620
For example, the head of the detention center treated me very well.

00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:22.620
He said, how can I help you?

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:24.620
What can I do for you?

00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:28.960
If you need help, always come to me.

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:30.960
The thing I realized is,

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:34.960
that all judges, prosecutors, detention center staff

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:39.960
are ordinary people who need to hear the good news.

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:42.960
And I tried to show them, by my behavior,

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:49.059
that Jehovah's Witnesses are peaceful people.

00:11:49.059 --> 00:11:54.059
Doing the trial, I particularly remember the support of the brothers and sisters.

00:11:54.059 --> 00:11:57.600
It's wonderful.

00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:01.600
And it would have been a lot harder without that.

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:04.600
I had a lot of court sessions.

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:07.600
At least 75.

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:10.600
I really appreciate it. Thank you.

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:13.600
There were brothers and sisters at every hearing.

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:15.600
But I always thought,

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:21.600
if you only knew how much it means to me to have you here.

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:23.600
Sometimes there were a lot.

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:26.600
But the whole was overcrowded.

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:30.600
And I know too that many of them has sacrificed their time,

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:32.600
asked to leave work,

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:38.580
just to be there to strengthen and support me.

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:43.580
Sometimes brothers and sisters also attended the hearings from other cities.

00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:47.580
And sometimes, maybe they wrote a little sign.

00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:50.580
A sign that says, we're from such and such a city.

00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:53.580
Hang in there, Danish. We love you.

00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:54.580
And so on.

00:12:54.580 --> 00:13:00.690
It was very encouraging to me.

00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:03.690
And I thought, oh yes, life is hard.

00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:05.690
But they took the time.

00:13:05.690 --> 00:13:08.690
Time to be there for me in these tough times.

00:13:08.690 --> 00:13:10.690
It's just wonderful.

00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:12.690
It's amazing.

00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:31.200
This is a VP State.

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:33.200
But thank you everybody for coming.

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:37.200
I'm very happy that you're here. Thank you.

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:40.200
When I got my final sentence of six years,

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:43.200
then there were a lot of people in the audience.

00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:50.200
Most of them were human rights activists, journalists,

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:54.799
and our brothers and sisters.

00:13:54.799 --> 00:13:57.799
I was also prepared for this, for this verdict.

00:13:57.799 --> 00:14:00.799
And it wasn't some kind of surprise to me.

00:14:00.799 --> 00:14:03.799
I took the verdict completely calmly.

00:14:03.799 --> 00:14:06.799
Of course, separation from my husband is terrible.

00:14:06.799 --> 00:14:16.700
When I came to the prison,

00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:19.700
I remember one incident in particular,

00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:22.700
talking to the deputy head of the prison.

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:25.700
He knew I was from Denmark.

00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:28.700
He knew I was one of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:29.700
He said to me,

00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:32.700
Danish, well, yes, in Denmark,

00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:34.700
you have a different prison system.

00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:38.700
But here in Russia, a man has to suffer in prison.

00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:41.700
In this prison, you won't preach.

00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:44.700
Here you won't talk to others about your faith,

00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:45.700
about the Bible.

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:47.700
Do you understand that?

00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:52.879
I understood that they wanted to break me.

00:14:52.879 --> 00:14:55.879
It was especially clear to me

00:14:55.879 --> 00:15:00.879
when they sent me to the punishment cells again and again.

00:15:00.879 --> 00:15:04.580
I was worried about my husband

00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:06.580
when he was in the punishment cell

00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:10.580
and not being able to talk on the phone at all.

00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:13.580
For eight months, we didn't talk to each other.

00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:14.580
We only had letters.

00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:16.580
How I dealt with it,

00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:18.580
well, here again,

00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:21.580
I decided a long time ago

00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:25.580
that sadness and discouragement were not for me.

00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:28.580
I really avoided these thoughts.

00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:31.580
I was very strict about my attitude

00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:33.580
because I knew basically,

00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:35.580
as it says in Proverbs,

00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:37.580
if you are sad,

00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:40.580
then your strength also disappears.

00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:43.580
And I knew it would be a long struggle

00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:45.580
and I wanted to endure.

00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:51.509
When I came to the prison,

00:15:51.509 --> 00:15:53.509
I didn't have a Bible.

00:15:53.509 --> 00:15:56.509
But when I went to the library,

00:15:56.509 --> 00:15:58.509
what Bible did I find there?

00:15:58.509 --> 00:16:00.509
Health of the New World Translation.

00:16:00.509 --> 00:16:02.509
I took it right away.

00:16:02.509 --> 00:16:04.509
The first part is the Russian Synodal.

00:16:04.509 --> 00:16:07.509
The second part is the New World Translation.

00:16:07.509 --> 00:16:12.139
I tried to read the Bible every day,

00:16:12.139 --> 00:16:14.139
like I was supposed to,

00:16:14.139 --> 00:16:16.139
and to meditate.

00:16:16.139 --> 00:16:18.139
I did have a special notebook

00:16:18.139 --> 00:16:20.139
where I wrote down good thoughts

00:16:20.139 --> 00:16:22.139
from the Bible that would strengthen me.

00:16:22.139 --> 00:16:26.100
When the mind is overflowing

00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:28.100
with these positive thoughts,

00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:32.100
then there's no room for negative thoughts.

00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:34.100
So, every morning,

00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:36.100
after the morning check,

00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:39.100
I would then have my Bible reading.

00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:43.100
Bible verses help me to stay calm and joyful.

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:47.139
For example,

00:16:47.139 --> 00:16:51.139
I often remembered Isaiah chapter 30, verse 15,

00:16:51.139 --> 00:16:54.139
where it says that we have to keep calm

00:16:54.139 --> 00:16:56.139
and trust in Jehovah,

00:16:56.139 --> 00:16:58.139
and that is our strength.

00:16:58.139 --> 00:17:05.450
Another scripture is Romans chapter 12, verse 21,

00:17:05.450 --> 00:17:09.450
where it says that we need to conquer evil with good.

00:17:09.450 --> 00:17:11.450
Why is that important?

00:17:11.450 --> 00:17:16.730
Because the prison world is not kindergarten.

00:17:16.730 --> 00:17:18.730
There are real criminals,

00:17:18.730 --> 00:17:20.730
people who behave badly.

00:17:20.730 --> 00:17:24.730
I tried not to act like the other prisoners.

00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:27.730
Not to be aggressive,

00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:30.730
I was constantly thinking about that.

00:17:30.730 --> 00:17:33.730
What I see is bad.

00:17:33.730 --> 00:17:35.730
I have to conquer this,

00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:37.730
not with evil, but with good.

00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:43.000
I have to remain a Christian.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000
Another scripture that has also strengthened me

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000
is Psalm 84, verse 11,

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000
which says that those who act blamelessly,

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.000
Jehovah does not deprive them of blessings.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.000
This means that if we do the right thing,

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.000
even though everyone else around you does their own thing,

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000
Jehovah does not rub us off our blessings.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.569
Of course, in difficult situations,

00:18:11.569 --> 00:18:13.569
you absolutely have to pray,

00:18:13.569 --> 00:18:16.569
because you can't calm down without it.

00:18:16.569 --> 00:18:18.569
Sometimes, when I was having a hard time,

00:18:18.569 --> 00:18:20.569
I prayed more than once.

00:18:20.569 --> 00:18:25.569
I tried to make my prayers more specific.

00:18:25.569 --> 00:18:28.569
I thought a little bit beforehand about

00:18:28.569 --> 00:18:31.569
what I wanted to talk to Jehovah about.

00:18:31.569 --> 00:18:37.029
One sister wrote me in the letter.

00:18:37.029 --> 00:18:42.029
If you want your prayers to mean something to Jehovah,

00:18:42.029 --> 00:18:45.029
then they must mean something to you too.

00:18:45.029 --> 00:18:49.029
And very often, I prayed that I had peace in my heart,

00:18:49.029 --> 00:18:52.029
that Jehovah would help me to keep my joy,

00:18:52.029 --> 00:18:54.029
to be happy,

00:18:54.029 --> 00:18:57.029
because I wanted it to be that way.

00:18:57.029 --> 00:19:01.470
Sometimes, when we were standing, doing the morning check,

00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:04.470
the other prisoners would say to me,

00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:07.470
Dennis, you are smiling again.

00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:09.470
What are you thinking about?

00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:10.470
And then I said,

00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:13.470
I just remember something good, something nice.

00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:16.470
And everybody was laughing at me then.

00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:20.980
Although prison and the colony,

00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:23.980
yes, they're not the best places on earth,

00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:26.980
but they're not the worst either.

00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:30.980
And when you remember why you were there,

00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:32.980
and when you're busy,

00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:34.980
busy doing good things,

00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:37.980
maybe you're writing letters to other people,

00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:40.980
to brothers, sisters, children, the elderly,

00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:43.980
and maybe when you're preaching, yes,

00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:47.980
then it's really an opportunity to be happy.

00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:51.980
That's the joy that all of us are supposed to have.

00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:54.980
It's not connected to what's around us.

00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:57.980
It's connected to what's inside you.

00:19:57.980 --> 00:19:59.980
I often thought, too,

00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:02.980
yes, okay, you can steal my freedom.

00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:05.980
Yes, you can make me not see my family,

00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:10.980
not to be able to hug them as often as I'd like.

00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:12.980
But inside,

00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:15.980
I will not let you steal my peace.

00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:18.980
I will not let you steal my joy.

00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:21.980
I want to be happy, to serve you over,

00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:23.980
to do as he wants,

00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:25.980
because he's a happy father,

00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:26.980
and I love him.

00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:32.539
And actually, I realized right away

00:20:32.539 --> 00:20:37.539
that you can't feel sorry for yourself in any way and think,

00:20:37.539 --> 00:20:39.539
why did this happen to us?

00:20:39.539 --> 00:20:41.539
These are very bad thoughts,

00:20:41.539 --> 00:20:43.539
and I tried to reject these thoughts

00:20:43.539 --> 00:20:45.539
as soon as they appeared,

00:20:45.539 --> 00:20:49.539
and replace them with something positive.

00:20:49.539 --> 00:20:51.539
And it worked.

00:20:51.539 --> 00:20:54.539
Daniels once wrote this interesting phrase.

00:20:54.539 --> 00:20:57.539
If you want to be happy, make others happy.

00:20:57.539 --> 00:21:00.539
And that thought helped me a lot.

00:21:00.539 --> 00:21:03.539
So this verse is also very dear to me.

00:21:03.539 --> 00:21:06.539
2 Corinthians 1, 3 and 4.

00:21:06.539 --> 00:21:10.539
Praise to be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,

00:21:10.539 --> 00:21:12.539
the Father of tender mercies,

00:21:12.539 --> 00:21:14.539
and the God of all comfort,

00:21:14.539 --> 00:21:18.539
who comforts us in all our trials,

00:21:18.539 --> 00:21:21.539
so that we may be able to comfort others

00:21:21.539 --> 00:21:23.539
in any sort of trial

00:21:23.539 --> 00:21:26.539
with the comfort we receive from God.

00:21:26.539 --> 00:21:28.539
This verse helped me to understand

00:21:28.539 --> 00:21:31.539
that I don't need to focus on my own problems,

00:21:31.539 --> 00:21:34.539
but having received comfort from God,

00:21:34.539 --> 00:21:36.539
I need to go and comfort others,

00:21:36.539 --> 00:21:39.539
because there were so many people around me

00:21:39.539 --> 00:21:42.539
who needed help, needed to be reassured,

00:21:42.539 --> 00:21:45.539
needed kind words and joy.

00:21:45.539 --> 00:21:47.539
And I was always busy.

00:21:47.539 --> 00:21:50.539
I was always looking for opportunities to help someone,

00:21:50.539 --> 00:21:53.539
who to visit, who to bring groceries to,

00:21:53.539 --> 00:21:56.539
or to visit the sick.

00:21:56.539 --> 00:22:00.539
It was difficult when I was in the pre-trial detention.

00:22:00.539 --> 00:22:04.539
After all, it's a pre-trial detention center

00:22:04.539 --> 00:22:07.539
that meant that everything I said there

00:22:07.539 --> 00:22:10.539
could have been used against me.

00:22:10.539 --> 00:22:13.539
Then when I was in the prison camp,

00:22:13.539 --> 00:22:15.539
I had a little more freedom.

00:22:15.539 --> 00:22:18.539
Because in the prison camp, there's an opportunity

00:22:18.539 --> 00:22:21.539
to get a personal visit for three days.

00:22:21.539 --> 00:22:24.539
That means that my wife can come and visit me.

00:22:24.539 --> 00:22:26.539
There you can go in your own clothes.

00:22:26.539 --> 00:22:28.539
You can cook your own food.

00:22:28.539 --> 00:22:30.539
Well, I'm socialized.

00:22:30.539 --> 00:22:34.539
And I was perfectly aware that my dear wife

00:22:34.539 --> 00:22:37.539
works very, very hard outside.

00:22:37.539 --> 00:22:40.539
She's always busy, like a bee.

00:22:40.539 --> 00:22:44.539
So I made a routine that when she came,

00:22:44.539 --> 00:22:46.539
I'd prepare the food.

00:22:46.539 --> 00:22:48.539
I'd cook.

00:22:48.539 --> 00:22:50.539
I'd wash the dishes.

00:22:50.539 --> 00:22:53.539
I wanted her to feel like my guest,

00:22:53.539 --> 00:22:57.539
to enjoy, to rest, to come home.

00:22:57.539 --> 00:23:00.539
I really needed that at the time.

00:23:00.539 --> 00:23:03.539
And when I came to the prison,

00:23:03.539 --> 00:23:05.539
it was certainly a joyful time.

00:23:05.539 --> 00:23:08.539
We had a lot of fun those three days.

00:23:08.539 --> 00:23:10.539
I was so grateful to my husband

00:23:10.539 --> 00:23:14.539
that he took very good care of me.

00:23:14.539 --> 00:23:17.539
Honestly, our relationship became stronger

00:23:17.539 --> 00:23:19.539
when Denis was in prison

00:23:19.539 --> 00:23:22.539
because I had never heard so many loving expressions

00:23:22.539 --> 00:23:24.539
from my husband.

00:23:24.539 --> 00:23:33.480
I have a Bible example

00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:36.480
that I hold even more dear now

00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:40.480
than I did at the beginning of my imprisonment.

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:43.480
It's of course the Apostle Paul.

00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:46.480
Because when I read his letters now,

00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:49.480
which he wrote while he was in prison,

00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:51.480
I sometimes feel that I have

00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:53.480
exactly those kinds of thoughts.

00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:59.849
I feel like I understand him even more.

00:23:59.849 --> 00:24:01.849
And I really wanted to be like him

00:24:01.849 --> 00:24:03.849
and to act like him.

00:24:03.849 --> 00:24:06.849
What was Paul doing when he was in prison?

00:24:06.849 --> 00:24:09.849
He tried to preach, talk to others,

00:24:09.849 --> 00:24:12.849
but what else did he do?

00:24:12.849 --> 00:24:14.849
He wrote letters.

00:24:14.849 --> 00:24:16.849
And so that was the motivation for me.

00:24:16.849 --> 00:24:18.849
I had a goal.

00:24:18.849 --> 00:24:21.849
I tried to write three letters a day.

00:24:21.849 --> 00:24:24.849
I wanted to strengthen others.

00:24:24.849 --> 00:24:26.849
I wanted to encourage them.

00:24:26.849 --> 00:24:28.849
I wanted to spread a little bit of joy

00:24:28.849 --> 00:24:31.849
because I love my brothers and sisters so much.

00:24:31.849 --> 00:24:36.220
A member of the prison staff said to me,

00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:40.220
Denis, I can see that you're very joyful.

00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:44.220
I said, yes, I'll be free soon.

00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:48.220
All my thoughts are there right now.

00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:50.220
It's like I'm not here.

00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:53.220
I'm already out there.

00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:55.220
Then he said to me, look Christensen,

00:24:55.220 --> 00:24:57.220
you've never been here.

00:24:57.220 --> 00:25:00.220
You've always been on the outside.

00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:02.220
You've always been free.

00:25:02.220 --> 00:25:07.589
You've always been joyful and happy.

00:25:07.589 --> 00:25:10.589
I've also imagined that day many times

00:25:10.589 --> 00:25:12.589
when I go out,

00:25:12.589 --> 00:25:15.589
when I see my brothers and sisters again,

00:25:15.589 --> 00:25:24.640
my family, and when I hug them.

00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:26.640
I'm in the car then, handcuffed,

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:27.640
driving around,

00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:38.690
and I see all of our dear brothers and sisters out there.

00:25:38.690 --> 00:25:41.690
Even though I only saw them for five seconds,

00:25:41.690 --> 00:25:44.690
even though I only heard them for five seconds,

00:25:44.690 --> 00:25:46.690
it's really strengthened me.

00:25:46.690 --> 00:25:49.690
I can just say that my heart was jumping with joy

00:25:49.690 --> 00:25:54.690
and I'm very grateful to these brothers and sisters.

00:25:54.690 --> 00:25:58.690
I was amazed at the number of people who were already there.

00:25:58.690 --> 00:26:01.690
They got there early and they were people

00:26:01.690 --> 00:26:04.690
from completely different cities.

00:26:04.690 --> 00:26:06.690
They prepared posters.

00:26:06.690 --> 00:26:08.690
They blew up balloons.

00:26:08.690 --> 00:26:11.690
They gave me a lot of flowers,

00:26:11.690 --> 00:26:14.690
just huge bouquets of flowers,

00:26:14.690 --> 00:26:16.690
and they said very beautiful words.

00:26:16.690 --> 00:26:20.690
So it's unique that you are not alone in this situation

00:26:20.690 --> 00:26:24.690
that really we are one big family.

00:26:24.690 --> 00:26:30.509
After that, we had an eight-hour ride to the airport.

00:26:30.509 --> 00:26:34.180
It was very exciting that, yes,

00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:36.180
we were going to the airport soon.

00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:38.180
It's all over,

00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:41.180
and I can be with Irina again.

00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:44.180
When we were right in Moscow at the airport,

00:26:44.180 --> 00:26:48.180
then Irina met me with my lawyer and the airport police.

00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:52.180
Well, actually it was okay, but a little tough.

00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:58.829
Okay, I was in this car.

00:26:58.829 --> 00:27:00.829
When we were at the airport,

00:27:00.829 --> 00:27:02.829
I saw that some people

00:27:02.829 --> 00:27:04.829
they smiled at me a lot.

00:27:04.829 --> 00:27:06.829
And then you right away

00:27:06.829 --> 00:27:09.829
that these were our brothers and sisters

00:27:09.829 --> 00:27:11.829
and the immigration officer

00:27:11.829 --> 00:27:13.829
he looked around like that and said,

00:27:13.829 --> 00:27:15.829
are these all yours?

00:27:15.829 --> 00:27:18.829
And they said, yeah, they are friends.

00:27:18.829 --> 00:27:23.829
And then, Dennis went to hug everybody.

00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:29.140
There were so many of our friends at the airport.

00:27:29.140 --> 00:27:32.140
And I'll tell you, if I smiled before,

00:27:32.140 --> 00:27:35.140
I smiled even more than

00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:37.140
it felt so good.

00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:44.259
And it shows one more thing

00:27:44.259 --> 00:27:47.259
that what a love we have between us.

00:27:47.259 --> 00:27:49.609
It's real.

00:27:49.609 --> 00:27:51.609
I'm crying, I'm sorry.

00:27:51.609 --> 00:28:22.509
Well, first of all, I would like to say that

00:28:22.509 --> 00:28:25.509
today is a happy day.

00:28:25.509 --> 00:28:28.509
A happy day because I at least

00:28:28.509 --> 00:28:30.509
got free from the prison.

00:28:30.509 --> 00:28:34.509
And I came home to Copenhagen, Denmark,

00:28:34.509 --> 00:28:37.509
where I can again be together

00:28:37.509 --> 00:28:40.509
with my friends and my beloved family.

00:28:40.509 --> 00:28:42.509
I would also like to say that

00:28:42.509 --> 00:28:46.509
I'm very glad and I appreciate all that

00:28:46.509 --> 00:28:48.509
that all the brothers and sisters

00:28:48.509 --> 00:28:52.509
have done for me in these five years.

00:28:52.509 --> 00:28:56.509
I had no brothers and sisters close to me.

00:28:57.509 --> 00:29:01.509
I've been, you can say, alone for five years in prison,

00:29:01.509 --> 00:29:03.509
but I never felt alone.

00:29:03.509 --> 00:29:07.509
I'm home and freedom with my family, with my wife,

00:29:07.509 --> 00:29:09.509
but my thoughts also goes

00:29:09.509 --> 00:29:13.509
to all our dear brothers and sisters in Russia

00:29:13.509 --> 00:29:16.509
because many of them are still suffering.

00:29:16.509 --> 00:29:18.509
I've always felt that Jehovah's Hand

00:29:18.509 --> 00:29:20.509
was never too short,

00:29:20.509 --> 00:29:23.509
to save, to support and to help.

00:29:23.509 --> 00:29:26.509
And I'm sure, 100% sure,

00:29:26.509 --> 00:29:28.509
that this will also happen to them.

00:29:28.509 --> 00:29:30.509
Many people ask me,

00:29:30.509 --> 00:29:34.509
oh, Dennis, as the prison time crossed you,

00:29:34.509 --> 00:29:36.509
did they break you?

00:29:36.509 --> 00:29:39.509
No way, never, ever.

00:29:39.509 --> 00:29:42.509
I had that goal that I will go out of prison

00:29:42.509 --> 00:29:45.509
even more stronger in a spiritual way

00:29:45.509 --> 00:29:48.509
that I was in when they put me in.

00:29:48.509 --> 00:29:49.509
And you know what?

00:29:49.509 --> 00:29:52.509
I am more determined than ever

00:29:52.509 --> 00:29:54.509
to be faithful to Jehovah,

00:29:54.509 --> 00:29:56.509
more determined to preach the good news,

00:29:56.509 --> 00:29:59.509
to help other brothers and sisters

00:29:59.509 --> 00:30:02.509
and other people to gain our goals.

00:30:02.509 --> 00:30:04.509
The goal is eternal life in paradise

00:30:04.509 --> 00:30:06.509
where we all have the opportunity

00:30:06.509 --> 00:30:09.509
to serve and preach Jehovah forever.

00:30:09.509 --> 00:30:12.509
So no, I'm not broken, no, I'm not crossed,

00:30:12.509 --> 00:30:20.599
I'm still here, I'm back.

00:30:20.599 --> 00:30:23.599
Now we're back in Denmark.

00:30:23.599 --> 00:30:25.599
Here we have to start a new life,

00:30:25.599 --> 00:30:28.599
start from scratch.

00:30:28.599 --> 00:30:32.599
I know it's not going to be all smooth sailing for Irina,

00:30:32.599 --> 00:30:34.599
but I will be there for her,

00:30:34.599 --> 00:30:38.599
I will definitely support her, help her,

00:30:38.599 --> 00:30:42.599
and I will continue to try to be a good husband,

00:30:42.599 --> 00:30:45.599
and will continue to show that I love her

00:30:45.599 --> 00:30:47.599
and will take care of her.

00:30:47.599 --> 00:30:56.869
We had an invaluable and unique experience

00:30:56.869 --> 00:31:00.869
that we really want to use to help others.

00:31:04.210 --> 00:31:07.210
We really want our brothers and sisters to know

00:31:07.210 --> 00:31:09.210
that it is possible to survive

00:31:09.210 --> 00:31:11.210
and that Jehovah is near,

00:31:11.210 --> 00:31:16.549
and you should never give up, you should never lose heart.

00:31:16.549 --> 00:31:18.549
I have learned to trust Jehovah

00:31:18.549 --> 00:31:20.549
and to rely on him completely,

00:31:20.549 --> 00:31:26.549
and not doubt that he will find the best way out of any situation.

00:31:26.549 --> 00:31:31.549
Jehovah showed that he will always help.

00:31:31.549 --> 00:31:34.549
I can tell you that all these trials,

00:31:34.549 --> 00:31:40.460
they strengthen my faith.

00:31:40.460 --> 00:31:43.460
I've seen that Jehovah is right beside me.

00:31:43.460 --> 00:31:47.460
I've seen that Jesus leads our organization

00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:49.460
in a wonderful way,

00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:51.460
and is a very caring King,

00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:54.460
because there were different needs,

00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:55.460
He made them all,

00:31:55.460 --> 00:31:57.460
there were different problems,

00:31:57.460 --> 00:32:00.460
but He helped me to cope with them.

00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:05.460
So yes, it was as if Jehovah became more real to me.

00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:14.319
You could say that prison is a very good school

00:32:14.319 --> 00:32:17.319
to polish your Christian qualities.

00:32:17.319 --> 00:32:24.859
Jehovah also knows that we are only little people.

00:32:24.859 --> 00:32:29.859
He won't expect more of you than you can give or do,

00:32:29.859 --> 00:32:33.529
and that's enough.

00:32:33.529 --> 00:32:35.529
Use what you can in all situations,

00:32:35.529 --> 00:32:37.529
is do what you can,

00:32:37.529 --> 00:32:39.529
and Jehovah takes care of the rest.

00:32:39.529 --> 00:32:44.609
I'm out now, and I'm very happy about that,

00:32:44.609 --> 00:32:47.609
but my prayers from my brothers and sisters,

00:32:47.609 --> 00:32:50.609
who are still in prison, haven't changed.

00:32:50.609 --> 00:32:54.609
On the contrary, I pray for them even more now,

00:32:54.609 --> 00:32:57.609
because I know what they are facing there.

00:32:57.609 --> 00:33:02.839
It's not always easy,

00:33:02.839 --> 00:33:07.839
but I'm also sure that Jehovah helps them as he helps me.
