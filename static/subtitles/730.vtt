00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:04.549
The Bible is a wonderful book.

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:08.550
It's a book that we should just enjoy reading.

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:14.550
So for this talk, I thought I'd give a couple of suggestions for adding to our reading pleasure.

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:16.550
Here's the first.

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.550
Don't pass quickly over the details.

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.550
Stop and investigate.

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.550
And at times, you'll be very glad you did.

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.550
Now let's take an example.

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.550
You're reading in the book of First Chronicles.

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.549
Now there are a lot of names in First Chronicles.

00:00:33.549 --> 00:00:36.549
And you come across the name, Human.

00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:42.549
If you were just interested in covering material, you'd probably pass over it and go on to the next verse.

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:44.549
But you're not in a rush.

00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:47.549
And you notice a cross reference beside the name.

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:50.549
It refers to you to First Chronicles 633.

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:52.549
So you decide to investigate.

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:57.549
And in doing so, you'll learn something heartwarming about Jehovah.

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:58.549
Let's do that.

00:00:58.549 --> 00:01:00.549
First Chronicles chapter 6.

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:03.549
I'll give you a moment.

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:08.079
And verse 33.

00:01:08.079 --> 00:01:09.079
It says,

00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:13.079
These are the men who served with their sons.

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:22.079
Of the co-affights, human, the singer, son of jewel, son of Samuel.

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:26.079
So this human was Samuel's grandson.

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:30.079
Now what do we know about his family situation?

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:34.079
Well, his father, Joel and his uncle, Abija, were judges.

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.079
But they had a terrible reputation.

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.079
They'd rule in your favor if you could pay enough.

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:42.079
But if you were poor, forget it.

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:45.079
And the whole country knew about it.

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:51.079
At one point, the Bible says that all the elders of Israel came to Samuel and said

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:55.079
they didn't want Joel and Abija as judges anymore.

00:01:56.079 --> 00:01:58.079
They wanted a king.

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.079
Jehovah was furious.

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.079
And he couldn't have been too happy with Joel and Abija either.

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:12.080
Now can you imagine the effect that this corruption had on the reputation of human's family?

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.080
The shame?

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.080
But like Hezekiah,

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.080
human didn't allow his father's, by example, to paralyze him.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.080
Human developed his own personal relationship with Jehovah.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.080
How do we know?

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.080
We followed a few clues.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.080
We followed a few cross-references.

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.080
And we came to Frisk Chronicles chapter 25 and verse 5.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.080
Let's do that.

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.080
Frisk Chronicles chapter 25 and verse 5.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.080
And again, we're trying to find something more about human.

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.080
It says all of these were sons of human,

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.080
a visionary of the king and matters pertaining to the true God to his glory.

00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:01.080
Thus the true God gave human 14 sons and three daughters.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.080
Did you see it?

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.080
A visionary of the king.

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.080
What was a visionary?

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.080
It was a kind of prophet.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.080
Now let's see.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.080
Samuel was a prophet.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.080
And now, human was a prophet.

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.080
Do you see what's heartwarming?

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:24.080
Jehovah was dealing with human in much the same way he had dealt with his grandfather.

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:30.080
Jehovah does not hold the sins of the fathers against the sons.

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.080
That is something very, very nice to remember.

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.080
And can you see where this example would help some people, you know?

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:44.080
Some, even in full-time service, have a hard time with it because they had a rough family background.

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.080
And they may feel that they're worthless.

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.080
Mary is a case in point.

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.080
I'm going to call her Mary.

00:03:51.080 --> 00:04:00.080
Now, Mary's father was so violent that at times Mary, her mom and her siblings had to get up in the middle of the night and run for their lives.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:04.080
And to the neighbors, they were that family.

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.080
To make it worse, they were poor.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.080
So all this made Mary feel worthless.

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.080
Until?

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.079
Until the day when she started studying with the witnesses.

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:23.079
She developed her own relationship with Jehovah and she accepted him as her father.

00:04:23.079 --> 00:04:26.079
And today, Mary's a pioneer.

00:04:26.079 --> 00:04:28.079
How does she feel about her life?

00:04:28.079 --> 00:04:30.079
Here's what she wrote.

00:04:30.079 --> 00:04:35.079
Jehovah is constantly looking for those who want a friendship with him.

00:04:35.079 --> 00:04:37.079
And here's a touching point.

00:04:37.079 --> 00:04:41.079
He's even looking into the hearts of children.

00:04:41.079 --> 00:04:42.079
Isn't that nice?

00:04:42.079 --> 00:04:44.079
Now, there are two lessons here.

00:04:44.079 --> 00:04:50.079
As humans' example shows, our family background doesn't define who we are.

00:04:50.079 --> 00:04:53.079
Jehovah will deal with us as individuals.

00:04:53.079 --> 00:04:56.079
And a second example, one for the elders.

00:04:56.079 --> 00:04:57.079
Be like Jehovah.

00:04:57.079 --> 00:05:01.079
Treat each member of the family as an individual.

00:05:01.079 --> 00:05:04.079
Don't lump them all in together.

00:05:04.079 --> 00:05:06.079
Not at our second point.

00:05:06.079 --> 00:05:09.079
We can make our Bible reading more enjoyable.

00:05:09.079 --> 00:05:13.079
If we try to fill in the blanks, then that's something that our Bible dramas do.

00:05:13.079 --> 00:05:15.079
They fill in the blanks for us.

00:05:15.079 --> 00:05:16.079
Now, let's illustrate.

00:05:16.079 --> 00:05:22.079
Let's consider the example of Queen Esther and the King's Son.

00:05:22.079 --> 00:05:24.079
Now, you remember the story.

00:05:24.079 --> 00:05:28.079
King of Hazueras, who was understood to be Xerxes I,

00:05:28.079 --> 00:05:32.079
was displeased with Queen Vashtai and he decided he was going to replace her.

00:05:32.079 --> 00:05:38.079
So a call went out, enter the whole Persian Empire for the most beautiful women

00:05:38.079 --> 00:05:40.079
to be brought to the palace.

00:05:40.079 --> 00:05:43.079
And Esther was among them.

00:05:43.079 --> 00:05:47.079
Now, the women were placed under the care of a man named Haggai,

00:05:47.079 --> 00:05:51.079
and his job was to get them ready to meet the King.

00:05:51.079 --> 00:05:55.079
Well, when we read Esther chapter 2 and verse 9,

00:05:55.079 --> 00:05:57.079
we smell trouble.

00:05:57.079 --> 00:05:58.079
Let's read it.

00:05:58.079 --> 00:06:03.079
And you see if you can figure out what trouble is looming here.

00:06:03.079 --> 00:06:07.079
Esther chapter 2 and verse 9.

00:06:07.079 --> 00:06:11.079
Remember, we're trying to fill in the blanks, we'll try to imagine.

00:06:11.079 --> 00:06:16.079
Now, the young woman, Esther, was pleasing to him, Haggai,

00:06:16.079 --> 00:06:20.079
and won his favor.

00:06:20.079 --> 00:06:23.079
Now, this is a competition.

00:06:23.079 --> 00:06:25.079
Keep that in mind. This is a competition.

00:06:25.079 --> 00:06:30.079
So he promptly arranged for her beauty treatments and her diet.

00:06:30.079 --> 00:06:34.079
Wait a minute. That's another detail we'll have to pursue some time.

00:06:34.079 --> 00:06:38.079
Esther was Jewish. She was trying to hide the fact that she was Jewish.

00:06:38.079 --> 00:06:40.079
And there were so many things that Jews couldn't eat.

00:06:40.079 --> 00:06:42.079
How did she handle that?

00:06:42.079 --> 00:06:44.079
That's for another day. That's Karyon.

00:06:44.079 --> 00:06:46.079
And talking about Haggai, it says,

00:06:46.079 --> 00:06:51.079
he assigned it to her seven selected young women from the King's house.

00:06:51.079 --> 00:06:59.079
He also transferred her and her young attendants to the best place in the house of the women.

00:07:00.079 --> 00:07:03.079
Do you smell trouble? You see the problem?

00:07:03.079 --> 00:07:05.079
Peripherential treatment.

00:07:05.079 --> 00:07:07.079
This is a competition.

00:07:07.079 --> 00:07:11.079
Probably there's a lot of jealousy going on among the candidates.

00:07:11.079 --> 00:07:16.079
And now Haggai is doing everything in his power to help Esther to win the King's heart.

00:07:16.079 --> 00:07:21.079
How do you suppose that went down? It could have led to big trouble.

00:07:21.079 --> 00:07:23.079
And here's another factor.

00:07:23.079 --> 00:07:25.079
What about the King's wives?

00:07:25.079 --> 00:07:27.079
Now, there was only one Queen.

00:07:27.079 --> 00:07:32.079
But a haziurus had many wives. Some say he had 330 wives.

00:07:32.079 --> 00:07:35.079
Now, when Vashthai was deposed,

00:07:35.079 --> 00:07:41.079
who do you suppose expected to become the Queen, the number two wife?

00:07:41.079 --> 00:07:45.079
And yet, instead of going into the harem and choosing someone,

00:07:45.079 --> 00:07:49.079
they went outside the palace even to women who didn't have a royal blood.

00:07:49.079 --> 00:07:53.079
How do you suppose that went down?

00:07:53.079 --> 00:07:55.079
And now think about this.

00:07:55.079 --> 00:08:00.079
Some scholars believe that although Vashthai was deposed as Queen,

00:08:00.079 --> 00:08:02.079
she didn't leave the palace,

00:08:02.079 --> 00:08:05.079
that she just couldn't ever see the King again.

00:08:05.079 --> 00:08:08.079
If she was still there as some scholars believe,

00:08:08.079 --> 00:08:11.079
was she plotting in the background?

00:08:11.079 --> 00:08:15.079
This could have been a very difficult situation.

00:08:15.079 --> 00:08:20.079
But Esther, two verse 15, tells us something very interesting about Esther.

00:08:20.079 --> 00:08:24.519
We're going to read just the end of verse 15.

00:08:24.519 --> 00:08:27.519
Esther too, at the end of verse 15,

00:08:27.519 --> 00:08:29.519
it says, all a while,

00:08:29.519 --> 00:08:35.519
Esther was winning the favor of everyone who saw her.

00:08:35.519 --> 00:08:38.519
Esther avoided the landmines.

00:08:38.519 --> 00:08:39.519
What does that tell us?

00:08:39.519 --> 00:08:41.519
She was not only a very beautiful woman,

00:08:41.519 --> 00:08:44.519
she had a beautiful, godly personality,

00:08:44.519 --> 00:08:47.519
a winning personality.

00:08:47.519 --> 00:08:51.519
Well, we said this was about Esther and the King's son.

00:08:51.519 --> 00:08:55.519
Who is the King's son, the heir?

00:08:55.519 --> 00:08:58.519
Well, we met him at the convention this past summer.

00:08:58.519 --> 00:09:01.519
He was the man who was so nice to Nehemiah.

00:09:01.519 --> 00:09:02.519
Artazerxes.

00:09:02.519 --> 00:09:05.519
And if the historians have their facts straight,

00:09:05.519 --> 00:09:08.519
Artazerxes would have been only three years old

00:09:08.519 --> 00:09:12.519
when Esther married his father.

00:09:13.519 --> 00:09:16.519
Now, history tells us that as King's approach ago,

00:09:16.519 --> 00:09:19.519
Artazerxes had a very nice personality.

00:09:19.519 --> 00:09:21.519
He was mild, peaceable kind,

00:09:21.519 --> 00:09:25.519
so unlike his father, who had a terrible temper.

00:09:25.519 --> 00:09:29.519
We have to ask, did Esther have anything to do

00:09:29.519 --> 00:09:32.519
with the pleasant disposition of Artazerxes?

00:09:32.519 --> 00:09:35.519
Maybe she did. Who knows?

00:09:35.519 --> 00:09:37.519
We're using our imagination.

00:09:37.519 --> 00:09:40.519
We're trying to fill in the blanks.

00:09:40.519 --> 00:09:43.519
Well, we haven't discussed anything earth-shaking here,

00:09:43.519 --> 00:09:45.519
and that isn't the point of this talk.

00:09:45.519 --> 00:09:50.519
But if you investigate the details and fill in the blanks,

00:09:50.519 --> 00:09:54.519
it'll contribute to the pleasure you derive from reading the Bible.

00:09:54.519 --> 00:09:58.519
And if Bible reading is a pleasant experience for you,

00:09:58.519 --> 00:10:04.519
you'll have no trouble to arrange a schedule of daily Bible reading.

00:10:04.519 --> 00:10:06.519
Enjoy!
