00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:08.330
Over 100 years ago, on October 31, 1916,

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.330
Brother Charles Taze Russell was traveling on a train

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.330
as part of a lecture tour across the United States,

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:21.329
quite unexpectedly and at the young age of 64,

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:23.329
Brother Russell died.

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:27.329
For years, he had been traveling continually.

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:29.329
You know, it's been said

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:34.329
that Brother Russell covered more than a million miles.

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:37.329
Now, of course, some of you may have accomplished that feat,

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:40.329
but at that time, of course, we're not talking about air travel.

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:44.329
Brother Russell had to accomplish that by train and ship

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:47.329
and goodness knows what other means, quite an accomplishment.

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:53.329
In addition to that, he had delivered more than 30,000 sermons,

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:55.329
lectures and talks.

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:58.329
He had written books and other material,

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:02.329
totaling over 50,000 pages.

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:05.329
Yet, despite all of the privileges that he had enjoyed,

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:09.329
his tremendous Bible knowledge and the powerful way

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:15.329
that Jehovah had used him in just a moment he was gone.

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:19.329
It really illustrates the truth of what James says here

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:22.329
in James chapter 4, verses 13 and 14.

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:25.329
Let's read this together.

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:28.329
James 4, verse 13.

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:31.329
Says, come now, you who say today or tomorrow

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:34.329
will travel to this city and will spend a year there

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:38.329
and we will do business and make some profit.

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:42.329
Whereas you do not know what your life will be like tomorrow.

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.329
For you are a mist that appears for a little while

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:49.329
and then disappears.

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:50.329
Well, that's true.

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:53.329
You see, really no matter what privileges we may enjoy,

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:58.329
how skilled a teacher we may be, what knowledge we've accumulated,

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:04.329
we're all just like a mist appearing for a while and then disappearing.

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:09.330
Well, this is an idea that occurs over and over again in the scriptures

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.330
and really with the purpose of encouraging all of us

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.330
to take a close and sober and serious look

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.330
at the way that we use our lives.

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:25.330
And even more importantly, how we use them to serve Jehovah.

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.330
In Luke chapter 12, you'll remember that Jesus taught

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.330
an illustration regarding a rich man.

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:32.330
Do you remember this?

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.330
Let's open our Bibles and read it together.

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.669
Luke chapter 12 and verse 16.

00:02:38.669 --> 00:02:41.669
Now, just before we read it, you'll remember that the purpose

00:02:41.669 --> 00:02:45.669
of Jesus giving this illustration was to emphasize the importance

00:02:45.669 --> 00:02:47.669
of being rich toward God.

00:02:47.669 --> 00:02:50.669
Now, let's read what he says here in verse 16.

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:53.669
The land of a rich man produced well.

00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:56.669
So he began reasoning within himself.

00:02:56.669 --> 00:03:00.669
What should I do now that I have nowhere to gather my crops?

00:03:00.669 --> 00:03:02.669
Then he said, I will do this.

00:03:02.669 --> 00:03:06.669
I will tear down my storehouses and build bigger ones.

00:03:06.669 --> 00:03:10.669
And there I will gather all my grain and all my goods.

00:03:10.669 --> 00:03:13.669
And I will say to myself, you have many good things

00:03:13.669 --> 00:03:15.669
stored up for many years.

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:16.669
Take it easy.

00:03:16.669 --> 00:03:17.669
Eat.

00:03:17.669 --> 00:03:18.669
Drink.

00:03:18.669 --> 00:03:20.669
Enjoy yourself.

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:24.669
But God said to him, unreasonable one.

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:28.669
This night they are demanding your life from you.

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:32.669
Who then is to have the things you stored up?

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:36.669
So it goes with a man who stores up treasure for himself

00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:40.669
but is not rich toward God.

00:03:40.669 --> 00:03:43.669
Well, what was the problem with this man?

00:03:43.669 --> 00:03:48.669
In the 2007 watchtower, August 1st, issue,

00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:50.669
this illustration was discussed.

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:55.669
And the watchtower said that the rich man's plan provided

00:03:55.669 --> 00:03:59.669
really only a false sense of security.

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:02.669
Practical, as it might have seemed to him,

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:06.669
it left out one vital element, God's will.

00:04:06.669 --> 00:04:09.669
The man was only thinking about himself,

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:13.669
how he would be able to take his ease and eat, drink,

00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:15.669
and enjoy himself.

00:04:15.669 --> 00:04:18.670
He thought that because he had many good things,

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:21.670
he would also have many years.

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:23.670
Isn't that an interesting point?

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:26.670
You see, he thought the abundance of things that he possessed

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:30.670
would somehow equate to the length of his life.

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:33.670
But the watchtower went on to say, too bad for him.

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:36.670
Things did not work out that way.

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:38.670
Just as Jesus said earlier,

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:41.670
even when a person has an abundance,

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:46.670
life does not result from the things he possesses.

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:49.670
Well, that brings us back to James 4.

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:51.670
Let's go back there again.

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:54.670
And look at what verse 15 says.

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:58.670
You see, after commenting on how our life is just like a mist appearing,

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:01.670
then verse 15 says, instead,

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:04.670
you should say, if Jehovah wills,

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:08.670
we will live and do this or that.

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:10.670
You see, the Bible makes it clear,

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:13.670
we should never ever develop overconfidence,

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:16.670
overconfidence in anything in our position,

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:19.670
our knowledge, our wisdom, our wealth,

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:24.670
but instead, you see, have complete confidence in Jehovah.

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:26.670
But really, our only hope,

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:30.670
our only confidence is with Jehovah.

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:34.670
Now, this applies not just to our view of life itself,

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:38.670
but really also to our view of all of our activities.

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:41.670
You see, in that verse in James 4,

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:43.670
it says not just about our life,

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:47.670
but about whether we will do this or do that.

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:52.670
So it really applies to all of the different things that we do every day.

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:57.670
Recently, we've been hearing reports of increasing persecution

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:01.670
in various lands, including Russia.

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:03.670
Now, when we hear those reports,

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:05.670
perhaps we begin to think right away

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:09.670
that this is something that could only happen in a faraway land.

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:13.670
You see, in countries like United States and Canada,

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:15.670
those who are listening to this program,

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:18.670
perhaps we have the attitude that,

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:21.670
well, this freedom of worship that we enjoy

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:23.670
is always going to be here,

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:25.670
and it will never change.

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:29.670
But it's interesting to consider what happened in one case

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:33.670
in 1972 in the country of Singapore.

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:37.670
On January 12, 1972,

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:42.670
a missionary who was serving at the branch received a letter suddenly,

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:44.670
delivered and delivered to him,

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:47.670
saying that he was banished from the country

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:49.670
and must leave within two weeks.

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:54.670
Now, this brother had been serving there peacefully for 23 years.

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:57.670
Everything going along very smoothly.

00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:01.670
Two days later, the Kingdom Hall was padlocked.

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:04.670
All the literature was banned in the country.

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:07.670
The bank accounts that belonged to the branch

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:10.670
and to the congregation were all seized.

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:14.670
Well, suddenly and very unexpectedly,

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:20.670
our work and all of our activities had been banned in that country.

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:22.670
Well, now, what do we learn from this?

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:26.670
Is it to teach us that we should live in some kind of morbid fear

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:30.670
that our work is going to be banned at any moment?

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:34.670
Well, what's the real reality of what happened in Singapore?

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:40.670
How did those unexpected events affect our brothers in that land?

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:42.670
Well, they were not broken.

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:46.670
Looking to Jehovah with complete confidence,

00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:49.670
they continued to find ways to worship Jehovah,

00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:55.670
and Jehovah has blessed their efforts right up until this present day.

00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:59.670
So, brothers, it's true, as James chapter 4 teaches us,

00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:04.670
life in this system is really filled with uncertainty.

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:08.670
But if we have made Jehovah our confidence

00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:11.670
and if we are truly rich toward God,

00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:14.670
then really whatever may come,

00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:17.670
whatever situation may befall us,

00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:20.670
even our untimely death,

00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:25.670
we are completely and totally safe with Jehovah.

00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:29.670
And he is the one because we have made our confidence

00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:32.669
who will care for us in every way.
