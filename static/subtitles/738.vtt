00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:07.620
There are many people who love to boast.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.900
Politicians frequently boast about what they have done and what they promise to do for

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.419
their constituents.

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:21.100
And businessmen, they love to boast about how successful they are and how much money

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.620
they are making.

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:28.140
And athletes, you know, athletes are prideful, many of them.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.219
And they boast about the events that they've been great in, they've won.

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:38.539
In fact, you know, it's an interesting to note that in the highly competitive sports

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:42.740
world, there is an expression for great achievers.

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:52.340
The expression is goat, G-O-A-T, greatest of all time.

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:59.020
Can you imagine people thinking that somehow they have been the greatest of all time?

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:05.700
When we hear the words greatest of all time, only one person comes to mind.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:12.140
He was the greatest man who ever lived truly the greatest of all time, Jesus Christ.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:20.859
And His greatness had nothing to do with politics, business, or playing games.

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:30.019
But it had everything to do with praising Jehovah and boasting in Jehovah God.

00:01:30.019 --> 00:01:38.379
Jesus knew the counsel that's recorded at Jeremiah, chapter 9, verses 23 and 24.

00:01:38.379 --> 00:01:44.019
And this scripture, this text is beautiful, Jeremiah 9, 23 and 24.

00:01:44.019 --> 00:01:46.299
It says,

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:49.739
This is what Jehovah says.

00:01:49.739 --> 00:01:54.340
Let not the wise man boast about his wisdom.

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.019
Let not the mighty man boast about his mightiness.

00:01:59.019 --> 00:02:04.019
And let not the rich man boast about his riches.

00:02:04.019 --> 00:02:13.340
But let the one boasting boast about this, that he has insight and knowledge of me, that

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:22.620
I am Jehovah, the one showing loyal love, justice, and righteousness in the earth.

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:30.340
For in these things I take delight, declares Jehovah, isn't that beautiful?

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:36.020
So to boast in Jehovah really means that we take pride in our God, Jehovah, we're proud

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.219
to bear His name.

00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:40.819
We rejoice in His reputation.

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:47.060
We've got it in the scriptures, and we can see it in the organization today.

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:54.659
And Jehovah takes delight when we boast in Him in His provisions, in His justice, His

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:58.740
promises, and in His loyal love.

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:07.099
So you students of the 150th class of Gilead, students soon to be graduates, I should add,

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:11.379
you've got a lot of reasons to boast in Jehovah God.

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:15.900
And you know that throughout His ministry, Jesus boasted in Jehovah.

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.219
If you examine closely the scriptures and things that Jesus said, you'll be able to see

00:03:20.219 --> 00:03:24.939
on many occasions how He boasted in Jehovah.

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:29.699
Just to give you one example, remember when the rich young ruler approached Jesus and

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:33.780
he says, oh, good teacher to the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.900
And what did Jesus say?

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.699
Why do you call me good?

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:43.780
Nobody is good except one God.

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:49.900
That was a wonderful boast in Jehovah God, glorifying Him.

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.979
So you students can boast in Jehovah, you've been doing it for a long time, but because

00:03:54.979 --> 00:04:00.819
now though you have the privilege of going out, fulfilling an assignment, and showing

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:06.900
how much you really do rely on Jehovah God, you can boast because you've experienced

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:12.060
what Jesus declared a John chapter 8, verse 32.

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.500
Jesus said, and you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.300
Well, that's something we all know.

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:26.500
But don't minimize it, appreciate the freedom you have right now because you know the truth.

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:31.420
You've been set free from the lives of this world that hold people in bondage about

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:34.899
false beliefs in life and death.

00:04:34.899 --> 00:04:39.100
You're free from human thinking that man is going to remedy the problems of this old

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.379
world, and we know they can't do it.

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:43.259
They haven't got the wherewithal to do it.

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:49.420
No man can really direct his own steps, not even a perfect man.

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:53.139
Jehovah can deliver his people too.

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:59.139
Even where we're under severe persecution, Jehovah can intervene whenever he sees fit

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:01.579
to do so.

00:05:01.579 --> 00:05:06.699
You can boast also in another thing that your slaves of Jehovah, now you're in a unique

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:11.579
position because very few slaves are allowed to choose their master.

00:05:11.579 --> 00:05:13.259
But you've done it.

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:19.259
You've chosen Jehovah God to be your master and to be a slave to him.

00:05:19.459 --> 00:05:24.259
You know that Jehovah is with you and you're happy and you're willing slaves of Jehovah

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:26.459
and of Jesus Christ.

00:05:26.459 --> 00:05:33.980
And it's a remarkable slavery, really, because no one has the freedom that we enjoy in our

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:36.060
slavery to Jehovah God.

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:43.420
We're so free and able to do so many things, serving Jehovah, but all the while enjoying

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:47.300
the good life that God has given to us.

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:52.139
You can boast also in the brotherhood that you can gather together in assemblies to

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:55.740
praise Jehovah God and you know Jesus words are true.

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:57.779
Two or three are gathered in His name.

00:05:57.779 --> 00:05:59.100
There He is in our midst.

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:06.019
So whether it's tens of thousands gathered together at a big convention or two or three

00:06:06.019 --> 00:06:12.060
gathering together secretly, you know that Jesus Christ is there with you.

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:15.819
You can also boast in the great privilege you have through prayer.

00:06:15.819 --> 00:06:18.139
Just think about it for a moment.

00:06:18.139 --> 00:06:22.699
You can talk to the Almighty Creator of the universe personally.

00:06:22.699 --> 00:06:28.379
That is really something quite remarkable, but that is a privilege we have and we boast

00:06:28.379 --> 00:06:33.980
in the privilege we have of addressing Jehovah, asking Him for His help for His Spirit to

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:37.620
guide us, His strength and protection.

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:42.259
And there's something else too that I find fascinating that you can boast in.

00:06:42.259 --> 00:06:48.819
You can boast it because you bear the fear inspiring name, Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:06:48.819 --> 00:06:50.740
Think about that.

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:58.459
You're carrying Jehovah's name and how grateful really we are that back in 1931, the

00:06:58.459 --> 00:07:04.540
visible part of Jehovah's organization adopted the name Jehovah's Witnesses and it's not

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:07.500
just the name of a religion.

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:10.500
It's a description of what people do.

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:13.579
They live their lives to honor Jehovah God.

00:07:13.579 --> 00:07:17.620
They are living witnesses of the Creator.

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:22.939
That is a privilege that we have and that separates us from all religion on the earth.

00:07:22.939 --> 00:07:28.139
And there's no other religion that wants that name anyhow, but we're delighted that we

00:07:28.139 --> 00:07:35.459
have it and they regret perhaps a few that they didn't listen to or adopted.

00:07:35.459 --> 00:07:42.180
We are God's name people and at 1 Chronicles chapter 16, verse 10, it says this,

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:49.139
boast about His holy name, let the hearts of those seeking Jehovah rejoice.

00:07:49.139 --> 00:07:57.379
And if you examine synonyms, rejoice is a synonym in certain cases for boast to boast in

00:07:57.379 --> 00:07:59.459
Jehovah.

00:07:59.459 --> 00:08:04.819
And you can boast over the fact that Jehovah has allowed you a very special privilege.

00:08:04.819 --> 00:08:08.620
You can see the unseen.

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:10.899
Not all people can do that.

00:08:10.899 --> 00:08:15.060
Division of many people in this world is limited just to just the physical that they see

00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:19.019
before them, but they can't see the unseen.

00:08:19.019 --> 00:08:24.899
I remember a man who said, what has God ever done for me?

00:08:24.899 --> 00:08:29.220
That poor man, he was blind, totally blind spiritually.

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:35.539
He enjoyed food, drink, the things the earth provides, but he couldn't see behind those

00:08:35.539 --> 00:08:36.940
physical things.

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:43.259
He couldn't see that there had to be a wonderful creator who provided all of these things

00:08:43.259 --> 00:08:45.860
for him.

00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:48.659
You can see the unseen.

00:08:48.659 --> 00:08:52.299
You see Jesus Christ ruling as King in the heavens.

00:08:52.299 --> 00:08:54.100
You see the new world that's coming.

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:57.059
You see the resurrection of the dead.

00:08:57.059 --> 00:09:03.139
You see the functioning of Jehovah God's Holy Spirit on His people today.

00:09:03.139 --> 00:09:08.700
Finally, you know very well that we've only touched on a few things that you can boast

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:14.539
in, but you want to continue doing that, boasting in Jehovah.

00:09:14.539 --> 00:09:18.100
And right now, I know all of you students, you feel great.

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:19.580
You've completed your course.

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:20.580
You've done it.

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:26.460
You're graduating from Gilead School, and now the doors of future activity are swinging

00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:28.779
open to you.

00:09:28.779 --> 00:09:39.379
So as you undertake your assignments, whatever and wherever they may be, do these things please,

00:09:39.379 --> 00:09:49.299
stay humble, be happy, and work hard, and always esteem highly the great honor and privilege

00:09:49.299 --> 00:09:53.059
you have to boast in Jehovah.
