00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:05.009
Our theme this month is Christian neutrality.

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.009
What it means, what it takes, and why we choose it.

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:13.009
What is your opinion?

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:15.009
Where do you stand?

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:19.010
Can one person make a difference in countering injustice?

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:22.010
When we hear people discussing political topics,

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.010
we might at first think their conversation is purely philosophical.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.010
But when injustice threatens our loved ones,

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.009
it can seem personal.

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.009
We expect that people will be divided over political ideology.

00:00:37.009 --> 00:00:41.009
Revelation, chapters 8 through 13, 4 told that in the last days,

00:00:41.009 --> 00:00:45.009
government would be the burning issue among mankind,

00:00:45.009 --> 00:00:49.009
and that people would feel pressured to take sides.

00:00:49.009 --> 00:00:52.009
The question each of us needs to ask himself is,

00:00:52.009 --> 00:00:58.009
how do I respond when people debate solutions to serious injustices?

00:00:59.009 --> 00:01:05.010
As Christians, we're most interested in the example of Christ.

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.010
If ever there was a person who could make a difference in countering injustice,

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.010
it was Jesus.

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.010
He felt deep compassion for people.

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.010
And with his abilities to feed the hungry, heal the sick,

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.010
raise the dead, and reach hearts with his winsome words,

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:26.010
Jesus could have exerted invincible influence in the realm of politics.

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.010
He certainly had the opportunity to do so.

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:33.010
Satan was pleased to offer him all the kingdoms of the inhabited earth

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.010
in an exchange for one active worship.

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:38.010
But Jesus wouldn't accept it.

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:42.010
Neither did he assert that Satan had no authority to make such an offer.

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:46.010
Later, Jesus' own countrymen tried to make him king.

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:49.010
But he rejected that too.

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:55.010
Later still, someone asked him whether it was lawful to pay taxes to the Roman government.

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:59.010
Again, Jesus didn't take sides.

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:06.010
He refused to become a world ruler, a national leader, or a political activist.

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:10.009
Did that mean that Jesus didn't care that he had no opinion?

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.009
Did the contrary?

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:15.009
Jesus cared more deeply than we can fathom.

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:21.009
And by treating people fairly, Jesus promoted justice at the most fundamental level.

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:26.009
Still, his principle focus was on teaching people about the kingdom of God

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:30.009
which would eliminate injustice for all time.

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:36.009
So what did Jesus indicate should be our position regarding human governments?

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:41.009
We learn from Jesus' response to the question about Roman taxation

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:47.009
as recorded at Mark 12 verses 15 through 17.

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:50.009
Bring me a denarius to look at.

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:51.009
They brought one.

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:53.009
And he said to them,

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:56.009
whose image and inscription is this?

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:58.009
They said to him, Caesars.

00:02:58.009 --> 00:03:00.009
Jesus then said,

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:03.009
pay back Caesar's things to Caesar,

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:06.009
but God's things to God.

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:10.009
What are Caesar's things?

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:13.009
At Romans chapter 13 verses 1 through 7,

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:19.009
the Apostle Paul lists tax, tribute, fear, and honor.

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:25.009
Notice, too, that Jesus said to pay back Caesar's things.

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:27.009
What does that imply?

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:29.009
That Caesar, the ruling authority of the day,

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:31.009
had issued valuable things.

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:33.009
Coins, for example,

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:38.009
thus Caesar had the right to ask for some of those coins back.

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:42.009
This enabled the state to continue rendering necessary services.

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:45.009
Jesus acknowledged that.

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:48.009
On the other hand, our most valuable possessions

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:50.009
are grants from God Himself.

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:52.009
Such gifts as our heart,

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:55.009
our life, our mind, and our strength.

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:58.009
We can't give those things back to Caesar

00:03:58.009 --> 00:04:01.009
because Caesar didn't grant them to us in the first place.

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:04.009
We rightly give those things back to God

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:08.009
in the form of our dedication and our love.

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:10.009
Regarding our love for God,

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:15.009
Jesus said at Mark chapter 12 and verse 30.

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:19.009
You must love Jehovah your God with your whole heart

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:23.009
and with your whole soul and with your whole mind

00:04:23.009 --> 00:04:27.009
and with your whole strength.

00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:31.009
So the love we give back to God is total.

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:36.009
No bodily part, function, capacity, or desire being left out.

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:41.009
Those who love God take the side of Jesus,

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:45.009
whom Jehovah has appointed as King.

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:48.009
But how would Jesus' disciples defend his kingdom

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:51.009
when people opposed it?

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:53.009
We gain insight from events that occurred

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:56.009
on the last night of Jesus' life on Earth.

00:04:56.009 --> 00:04:59.009
Recall from Matthew chapter 26

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:02.009
that when a large crowd with swords and clubs

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:04.009
came to arrest Jesus,

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:07.009
Peter drew his sword and struck the slave

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:10.009
of the high priest taking off his ear.

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:13.009
John reports that the slave's name was Malkus.

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:16.009
Luke adds that Jesus touched the man's ear

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:18.009
and healed him.

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:19.009
Imagine that.

00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:22.009
Jesus bore no ill will toward the men

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:24.009
taking him into custody.

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:28.009
Further, according to Matthew chapter 26 verse 52,

00:05:28.009 --> 00:05:30.009
Jesus told Peter,

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:32.009
return your sword to its place,

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:35.009
for all those who take up the sword

00:05:35.009 --> 00:05:38.009
will perish by the sword.

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:42.009
Why did Jesus disapprove of Peter's brave act?

00:05:42.009 --> 00:05:44.009
For the same reason that he had avoided

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:47.009
the political process all the way up to that point?

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:49.009
Jesus explained this when he appeared

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:52.009
before Pontius Pilate later that night.

00:05:52.009 --> 00:05:56.009
At John chapter 18 verse 36,

00:05:56.009 --> 00:05:58.009
we read,

00:05:58.009 --> 00:06:03.009
My kingdom is no part of this world.

00:06:03.009 --> 00:06:07.009
Yes, because Jesus' kingdom is not of human origin,

00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:10.009
it doesn't need human defenses.

00:06:10.009 --> 00:06:13.009
How can we be sure that this is what Jesus meant?

00:06:13.009 --> 00:06:18.009
Look closely at the rest of John chapter 18 verse 36.

00:06:18.009 --> 00:06:21.009
If my kingdom were part of this world,

00:06:21.009 --> 00:06:23.009
my attendance would have fought

00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:26.009
that I should not be handed over to the Jews,

00:06:26.009 --> 00:06:32.009
but as it is, my kingdom is not from this source.

00:06:32.009 --> 00:06:34.009
So as Christians,

00:06:34.009 --> 00:06:38.009
what is our position where political matters are concerned?

00:06:38.009 --> 00:06:41.009
We are neutral.

00:06:41.009 --> 00:06:45.009
Sometimes people misunderstand this few point.

00:06:45.009 --> 00:06:47.009
Some have concluded that because we don't promote

00:06:47.009 --> 00:06:49.009
one human government,

00:06:49.009 --> 00:06:52.009
that we must be promoting another human government.

00:06:52.009 --> 00:06:54.009
In the 1950s,

00:06:54.009 --> 00:06:56.009
now the Republic of Congo,

00:06:56.009 --> 00:06:58.009
authorities falsely accused Jehovah's Witnesses

00:06:58.009 --> 00:07:00.009
of being communists.

00:07:00.009 --> 00:07:02.009
But during the 1970s,

00:07:02.009 --> 00:07:05.009
when Congo adopted a communist form of government,

00:07:05.009 --> 00:07:07.009
the new authorities found fault with us

00:07:07.009 --> 00:07:09.009
for not being communists.

00:07:09.009 --> 00:07:12.009
Today, however, and for nearly three decades,

00:07:12.009 --> 00:07:14.009
Jehovah's Witnesses have enjoyed legal status

00:07:14.009 --> 00:07:16.009
in the Republic of Congo.

00:07:16.009 --> 00:07:20.009
And whereas some have perceived our Christian neutrality

00:07:20.009 --> 00:07:22.009
as sheer apathy,

00:07:22.009 --> 00:07:26.009
others construe our position as a threat.

00:07:26.009 --> 00:07:29.009
Let's address both of these viewpoints.

00:07:29.009 --> 00:07:33.009
First, there is a big difference between Christian neutrality

00:07:33.009 --> 00:07:35.009
and apathy.

00:07:35.009 --> 00:07:38.009
Apathy is defined as a lack of interest,

00:07:38.009 --> 00:07:40.009
enthusiasm or concern.

00:07:40.009 --> 00:07:43.009
But we certainly don't lack interest in people,

00:07:43.009 --> 00:07:45.009
nor are we insensitive to their feelings,

00:07:45.009 --> 00:07:48.009
like Jesus we strive to alleviate people's suffering

00:07:48.009 --> 00:07:50.009
by helping them in practical ways,

00:07:50.009 --> 00:07:53.009
while teaching them about the only kingdom

00:07:53.009 --> 00:07:55.009
that can eliminate injustice.

00:07:55.009 --> 00:07:58.009
By teaching people from God's word,

00:07:58.009 --> 00:08:00.009
we endeavor to change hearts,

00:08:00.009 --> 00:08:02.009
not political institutions.

00:08:02.009 --> 00:08:04.009
We feel this approach is realistic

00:08:04.009 --> 00:08:08.009
because mankind's main problems are not political,

00:08:08.009 --> 00:08:11.009
but moral.

00:08:11.009 --> 00:08:13.009
But why can it be said that Jehovah's Witnesses

00:08:13.009 --> 00:08:15.009
are not a threat,

00:08:15.009 --> 00:08:17.009
but rather an asset?

00:08:17.009 --> 00:08:20.009
We conscientiously obey the laws.

00:08:20.009 --> 00:08:23.009
We support our communities through volunteer service

00:08:23.009 --> 00:08:26.009
or compulsory civilian service where that exists,

00:08:26.009 --> 00:08:29.009
and we pay our taxes.

00:08:29.009 --> 00:08:33.009
It's true we don't vote for political parties or candidates,

00:08:33.009 --> 00:08:35.009
but neither do we disrupt elections

00:08:35.009 --> 00:08:38.009
or interfere with those who choose to vote.

00:08:38.009 --> 00:08:40.009
It's true we don't lobby, campaign,

00:08:40.009 --> 00:08:42.009
or run for government office,

00:08:42.009 --> 00:08:44.009
but neither do we criticize those in power,

00:08:44.009 --> 00:08:46.009
undermine their policies,

00:08:46.009 --> 00:08:49.009
or demonstrate for political change.

00:08:49.009 --> 00:08:51.009
It's true we won't salute a flag,

00:08:51.009 --> 00:08:53.009
but neither will we burn a flag,

00:08:53.009 --> 00:08:54.009
spit on a flag,

00:08:54.009 --> 00:08:57.009
or disparage the nation that a flag represents,

00:08:57.009 --> 00:09:00.009
even in lands where these are considered

00:09:00.009 --> 00:09:03.009
protected expressions of freedom.

00:09:03.009 --> 00:09:06.009
It's true we don't sing national anthems,

00:09:06.009 --> 00:09:09.009
but neither do we discourage others from singing,

00:09:09.009 --> 00:09:12.009
nor do we make a public spectacle of not singing.

00:09:12.009 --> 00:09:15.009
We simply don't participate.

00:09:15.009 --> 00:09:18.009
It's true we wouldn't kill people in war,

00:09:18.009 --> 00:09:21.009
but neither would we attack people at home.

00:09:21.009 --> 00:09:24.009
So while we don't promote any political position,

00:09:24.009 --> 00:09:27.009
neither do we condemn any political position,

00:09:27.009 --> 00:09:28.009
even in our heart.

00:09:28.009 --> 00:09:32.009
That is what neutrality means.

00:09:32.009 --> 00:09:35.009
We don't take sides.

00:09:35.009 --> 00:09:39.009
But what if the demands of the state

00:09:39.009 --> 00:09:43.009
can flicked with the commands of Jesus?

00:09:43.009 --> 00:09:45.009
There's a Bible principle for that.

00:09:45.009 --> 00:09:48.009
Are you thinking of what it says at Acts chapter 5

00:09:48.009 --> 00:09:50.009
verses 28 and 29,

00:09:50.009 --> 00:09:54.009
that we must obey God as ruler rather than men?

00:09:54.009 --> 00:09:57.009
This is not disregard for the state,

00:09:57.009 --> 00:10:00.009
but rather reverence for God.

00:10:00.009 --> 00:10:04.009
If the state demands that we do what God forbids,

00:10:04.009 --> 00:10:07.009
or refrain from doing what God commands,

00:10:07.009 --> 00:10:12.009
then we believe God would consider that an invalid request.

00:10:12.009 --> 00:10:15.009
Now one might say,

00:10:15.009 --> 00:10:17.009
I can imagine some situations

00:10:17.009 --> 00:10:20.009
where that viewpoint could get you into trouble.

00:10:20.009 --> 00:10:24.009
Jesus foretold as much at Matthew chapter 24 verse 9,

00:10:24.009 --> 00:10:25.009
where he said,

00:10:25.009 --> 00:10:30.009
you will be hated by all the nations on account of my name.

00:10:30.009 --> 00:10:33.009
More specifically at Revelation chapter 2 and verse 10,

00:10:33.009 --> 00:10:36.009
Jesus said that some of his disciples

00:10:36.009 --> 00:10:38.009
would be thrown into prison.

00:10:38.009 --> 00:10:41.009
Not all of us, but some.

00:10:41.009 --> 00:10:44.009
So we're not disappointed if we don't get thrown into prison,

00:10:44.009 --> 00:10:47.009
but neither are we discouraged if we do.

00:10:47.009 --> 00:10:51.009
Our minds turn to the thousands of brothers and sisters

00:10:51.009 --> 00:10:53.009
who have been sentenced to prison over the years

00:10:53.009 --> 00:10:55.009
for their Christian neutrality.

00:10:55.009 --> 00:10:57.009
We are proud of them.

00:10:57.009 --> 00:10:59.009
We pray for them.

00:10:59.009 --> 00:11:02.009
We know that Jehovah is pleased with them.

00:11:02.009 --> 00:11:07.009
Their endurance under trial spells victory for all of us.

00:11:07.009 --> 00:11:09.009
How so?

00:11:09.009 --> 00:11:14.009
To the congregation in Ephesus, Paul wrote,

00:11:14.009 --> 00:11:17.009
I ask you not to give up on account of my tribulations

00:11:17.009 --> 00:11:23.009
in your behalf for these mean glory for you.

00:11:23.009 --> 00:11:25.009
Paul wrote these words while he himself

00:11:25.009 --> 00:11:28.009
was under house arrest in Rome.

00:11:28.009 --> 00:11:34.009
In what sense did Paul's tribulations mean glory for the Ephesians?

00:11:34.009 --> 00:11:38.009
In that his perseverance in ministering despite trials

00:11:38.009 --> 00:11:41.009
showed the congregation that the privileges they enjoyed

00:11:41.009 --> 00:11:44.009
as Christians were of the highest importance.

00:11:44.009 --> 00:11:48.009
If Paul had just given up, what would that have implied?

00:11:48.009 --> 00:11:52.009
That their faith, their ministry, and their hope in God's kingdom

00:11:52.009 --> 00:11:54.009
were not so valuable after all.

00:11:54.009 --> 00:11:58.009
Instead, Paul's endurance exalted Christianity.

00:11:58.009 --> 00:12:03.009
It demonstrated that remaining faithful is worth any sacrifice.

00:12:03.009 --> 00:12:06.009
In like manner, the endurance of our dear brothers

00:12:06.009 --> 00:12:10.009
and sisters in prison proves that their hope is alive

00:12:10.009 --> 00:12:13.009
and that the kingdom they represent is real.

00:12:13.009 --> 00:12:19.009
They have an identity as envoys, not of any human government,

00:12:19.009 --> 00:12:23.009
but of the heavenly kingdom, a kingdom that will reward them

00:12:23.009 --> 00:12:27.009
with everlasting life in a world without war.
