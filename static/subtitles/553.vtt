00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:11.740
Trust in Jehovah and do what is good and act with faithfulness, Psalm 37.3.

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:18.140
The Watchtower study article that introduced this as the year text for 2017

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:23.679
opened up a beautiful and practical way of thinking about how to manage problems in life.

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:29.480
Recognize what you cannot do and trust in Jehovah.

00:00:29.559 --> 00:00:35.060
Recognize what you can do and do that.

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:40.859
Now, the article gave us a number of examples of people who did that in a variety of circumstances.

00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:47.359
Noah recognized that he could not force wicked people to accept his message.

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:52.600
He had no control over when the flood would come.

00:00:52.679 --> 00:01:00.679
But he could faithfully proclaim the warning message, and he could build the ark.

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:07.640
So he focused on doing those things, trusting in Jehovah for the rest.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:15.560
A King David, after sinning, seriously recognized that he couldn't undo what he had done.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.760
Neither could he escape the consequences for what he had done.

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:28.439
But he could avail himself of Jehovah's arrangements, accept correction, and move forward.

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.599
And as we take ourselves through that exercise, we can apply that way of thinking

00:01:32.599 --> 00:01:36.000
to any number of situations that we face in life.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.560
Recognize what you cannot do and trust in Jehovah.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.200
Recognize what you can do and do that.

00:01:45.239 --> 00:01:52.319
And also, think about Bible examples of people who were in a situation that you can identify with.

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:59.959
For instance, say you have an enormously difficult task to accomplish in a very short period of time.

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:03.439
Can you think of someone in the Bible who faced a similar situation?

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:05.840
Many possibilities come to mind.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:11.840
But let's focus on 2 Chronicles chapter 14, the account of ASA.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:25.919
2 Chronicles 14, 9 says, later, 0, the Ethiopian came against them with an army of 1,000,000 men and 300 chariots.

00:02:25.919 --> 00:02:28.159
How big was ASA's army?

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:33.280
Verse 8 says, 580,000 men with hand weapons.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.800
So 0's army was almost twice as large and far better equipped.

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.360
What would ASA do?

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.800
Verse 11.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.199
ASA then called to Jehovah his God and said,

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:52.479
O Jehovah, it does not matter to you whether those you help are many or have no power.

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:58.319
Help us, O Jehovah, our God, for we are relying on you.

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:04.479
And in your name we have come against this crowd, O Jehovah, you are our God.

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:10.080
Do not let mortal man prevail against you.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:16.719
Now, ASA knew that he could not turn 0 away in his own power.

00:03:16.719 --> 00:03:22.319
He knew he could not fight a million man army with 300 chariots and win.

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:25.919
So he left the impossible to Jehovah.

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:29.520
But what could ASA do?

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.560
Notice verses 12 through 14.

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:39.199
And as you read this, notice what Jehovah gets the credit for and what ASA gets the credit for.

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:48.080
So Jehovah defeated the Ethiopians before ASA and before Judah and the Ethiopians fled.

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:54.560
And ASA and the people with him pursued them as far as Giroir.

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.919
And the Ethiopians continued falling.

00:03:57.919 --> 00:04:07.199
And ASA continued gathering much spoil, much of which he later sacrificed to Jehovah.

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:12.400
So when faced with an impossible task, ASA recognized what he could not do, trusted in Jehovah.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.160
But he also recognized what he could do and he did that.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:25.610
Now, did Jehovah actually need ASA's military force more on that in a minute?

00:04:26.329 --> 00:04:30.970
But first, how can we apply Psalm 373 today?

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.569
Are you facing a difficult work assignment, a challenging personality,

00:04:34.569 --> 00:04:38.170
dynamic health crisis, a financial shortfall?

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:42.009
No doubt this Psalm 373 process can help you think productively.

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:49.290
Because of an accident, a brother in the Midwest lost a well-paying job that he held for 14 years.

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:51.769
Now his family had no income.

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:53.769
They supplicated Jehovah.

00:04:53.769 --> 00:04:55.610
They trusted in Jehovah.

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:01.370
First and foremost, but was there anything that they could actually do in conjunction with that?

00:05:02.329 --> 00:05:05.050
Yes, they cut down on their expenses.

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:08.329
They gleaned in nearby fields.

00:05:08.329 --> 00:05:14.089
They fished for their food with help from the congregation and taking some part time work

00:05:14.089 --> 00:05:15.209
when it became available.

00:05:15.209 --> 00:05:19.610
This family of four managed a year after the accident.

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:25.529
The mother said, we can fool ourselves into thinking that we are relying on Jehovah.

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:32.329
When we are really relying upon our own abilities, our mate, or our job,

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:38.009
we, though, really learned to trust just him.

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:40.410
That is, Jehovah.

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:44.490
These other things can be taken out of the way, but Jehovah never left us.

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:50.250
Not for one moment, though we have just the bare necessities our relationship with Jehovah as

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:52.170
a family is much closer.

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:55.050
Candid observation.

00:05:56.009 --> 00:05:59.449
Trust in Jehovah do what is good.

00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:06.490
It seems like a simple equation, but how easy it could be to mistake the do what is good

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:11.209
part for trusting in our own abilities?

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:17.209
What happened to Asa more than a decade after his smashing

00:06:17.769 --> 00:06:21.209
victory over the million Ethiopians?

00:06:21.209 --> 00:06:25.209
2 Chronicles chapter 16 verse 1.

00:06:25.209 --> 00:06:26.170
1 through 3.

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:32.170
He faces another confrontation in the 36th year of the reign of King Asa.

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:38.250
King Bayesha of Israel came up against Judah and began to build up Rema to prevent anyone from

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:41.209
going out or coming in to King Asa of Judah.

00:06:42.089 --> 00:06:44.730
What would Asa do in this case?

00:06:45.209 --> 00:06:51.930
At that, Asa brought out silver and gold from the treasuries of Jehovah's house.

00:06:53.529 --> 00:06:55.769
So he is spending Jehovah's money.

00:06:56.569 --> 00:06:58.889
Surely he consulted God about that.

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:07.689
And the King's house and sent them to King Ben Haydad of Syria, who was dwelling in Damascus,

00:07:07.689 --> 00:07:12.889
saying, there is a treaty between me and you and between my father and your father.

00:07:12.889 --> 00:07:14.810
I'm sending you silver and gold.

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:21.610
Come, break your treaty with the King Bayesha of Israel so that he will withdraw from me.

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:24.410
What was Asa thinking?

00:07:25.449 --> 00:07:28.410
Did he consider Bayesha not much of a threat?

00:07:29.209 --> 00:07:31.529
Was he thinking he was smart enough to outmaneuver him?

00:07:32.649 --> 00:07:34.410
Did his strategy work?

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:38.410
Reading through verses 4 through 6, it might at first appear that his plan was successful.

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:41.370
But what was the problem?

00:07:42.329 --> 00:07:46.970
Haneinai explains in verses 7 through 9.

00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:52.649
At that time, Haneinai the seer came to King Asa of Judah and said to him,

00:07:53.529 --> 00:08:03.290
because you relied on the King of Syria and did not rely on Jehovah your God.

00:08:04.329 --> 00:08:08.250
The army of the King of Syria has escaped out of your hand.

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:12.410
We're not the Ethiopians and the Libyans of very great army,

00:08:13.129 --> 00:08:15.370
with many chariots and horsemen.

00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:21.209
But because you relied on Jehovah, he gave them into your hand.

00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:26.810
For the eyes of Jehovah are roving about through all the earth to show his strength in

00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:29.769
behalf of those whose heart is complete toward him.

00:08:29.769 --> 00:08:36.009
You have acted foolishly in this matter, and from now on there will be wars against you.

00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:39.129
What can we learn from this account?

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:42.330
Remember, Jehovah.

00:08:43.289 --> 00:08:45.850
Remember what Jehovah has done for you in the past.

00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:47.769
Continue to rely on him today.

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:52.169
Doing what is good is really an act of faith.

00:08:52.169 --> 00:08:57.529
It's evidence of participation of our desire to receive Jehovah's blessing.

00:08:58.169 --> 00:09:01.529
But we don't outgrow trusting in Jehovah.

00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:07.370
Jehovah is looking for opportunities to show his strength in behalf of those whose

00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:08.889
heart is complete toward him.

00:09:08.889 --> 00:09:11.370
And that brings us to the account of Ace's son,

00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:12.409
Jehoshaphat.

00:09:12.409 --> 00:09:16.809
Jehoshaphat doubled Ace's army to exceed a million.

00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:23.610
Yet he found himself terrified by the onslaught of Moab-Amen in the mountainous region of Seer.

00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:24.330
What did he do?

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:26.169
He trusted in Jehovah.

00:09:26.169 --> 00:09:27.450
What good could he do?

00:09:28.409 --> 00:09:33.129
Fighting in that instance would have been an act of disobedience because Jehovah told them simply to go out,

00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:35.929
stand still, and don't be afraid.

00:09:36.730 --> 00:09:37.610
So they sang.

00:09:39.129 --> 00:09:45.690
Doing what is good is a reflection of our faith and our desire for Jehovah's blessing.

00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:50.730
And when that is the motive, it results in a resounding victory.

00:09:51.529 --> 00:09:55.450
Let's go out and have a resounding victory today.
