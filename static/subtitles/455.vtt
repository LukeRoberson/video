00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:06.690
What made Ezra such a sterling example of faith and trust in God?

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.189
More importantly, how can you and I?

00:00:09.189 --> 00:00:16.190
How can we imitate the total reliance that Ezra put on Jehovah God and in his word?

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:17.690
Well, let's find out.

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:19.690
Let's examine Ezra chapter 7.

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:22.690
Let's open our Bibles to Ezra chapter 7.

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:25.690
And we're going to look at verse 6 and 7.

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:33.350
Now, verse 6, it says Ezra came up from Babylon.

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.350
So that's where he lived.

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.350
Remember, he was under the Meadow Persian Empire at the time.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.350
And he lived there, and he was well versed in the law, skilled copious.

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:54.350
But verse 7, it says that he went up to Jerusalem now in the seventh year of King Artisercis.

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:01.350
Now, the seventh year of King Artisercis would be the year 468 BCE.

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:08.349
So as a reference point, we have 607 BCE when Jerusalem was destroyed,

00:01:08.349 --> 00:01:13.349
537 when the Jews returned to their homeland in Jerusalem,

00:01:13.349 --> 00:01:18.349
515 under the encouragement of Haggai and Zechariah,

00:01:18.349 --> 00:01:21.349
and the Jews rebuilt the temple to Jehovah.

00:01:21.349 --> 00:01:25.349
Now, at that time Ezra probably wasn't even born yet.

00:01:25.349 --> 00:01:32.349
So he enters into the picture here in the year 468 BCE.

00:01:32.349 --> 00:01:38.349
But the question is, what would have moved Ezra to want to move to Jerusalem?

00:01:38.349 --> 00:01:43.349
He was probably about 30 years old when he made this move.

00:01:43.349 --> 00:01:49.349
And he wanted to advance pure worship, even as it mentions in verse 10,

00:01:49.349 --> 00:01:55.349
that he wanted to teach the regulations and judgments in Israel, but what would have moved him to do that?

00:01:55.349 --> 00:02:00.349
Ezra would have lived during the time period of Esther and Mordekai.

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:05.349
And that was the time period when Haman tried to exterminate the Jews.

00:02:05.349 --> 00:02:12.349
Now, that was in the year 484 BCE, and Ezra was a teenager at that time.

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:16.349
So he would have seen firsthand how Jehovah defended his people,

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:19.349
how Jehovah strengthened and cared for his people.

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:22.349
This event, this national crisis,

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:27.349
would have made an indelible impression and imprint on that young man's mind and heart.

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:31.349
And no doubt he said to himself, when I get of age, I want to go to Jerusalem.

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:35.349
I want to be there to help and advance pure worship.

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:38.349
So that's what he decided to do.

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:43.349
However, it wasn't easy for Ezra to make this move to Jerusalem.

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:47.349
And that's where we come to verse 10.

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:53.349
Ezra had prepared his heart to consult the law of Jehovah,

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:57.349
so to prepare his heart, what did Ezra have to do?

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:59.349
How did he prepare his heart?

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:02.349
We must have asked himself questions.

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:05.349
Why do I want to go to Jerusalem?

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:09.349
Is it just to make a name for myself or is it to honor Jehovah?

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:11.349
How do I feel about going there?

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:14.349
How do I feel about leaving my family and my friends

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:18.349
in this comfortable way of life that I have here in Babylon?

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:22.349
And I'm going to leave it all behind, I'm going to move to this distant land

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:26.349
and to live under circumstances that would be difficult.

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:30.349
So he's preparing his heart by asking himself these questions.

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:36.349
But he was desirous of putting Jehovah's work first.

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:39.349
Now notice here in verse 10, it says,

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:45.349
and then he wanted to consult the law of Jehovah.

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:47.349
That's why we love Ezra.

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:49.349
He consults the law of Jehovah.

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:52.349
That was his love. That was his first priority.

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:57.349
He didn't consult the arithmetic, the astronomy, the history,

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:00.349
the chronology, and the geography of Babylon.

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:03.349
No, it was the law of Jehovah.

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:06.349
In fact, Ezra had deep respect for that law of Jehovah.

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:09.349
He's the one who wrote first and second chronicles.

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:12.349
It shows that he was a deep student of God's word.

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:15.349
If you're familiar with Psalm 119 and 18,

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:18.350
you can imagine him saying before studying,

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:23.350
open my eyes so that I may see clearly the wonderful things of your law.

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.350
That's Ezra.

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:29.350
And when we think about him and how he meditated deeply

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:31.350
on the information that he gathered,

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:34.350
he gathered information about the kings of Judah,

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:35.350
about the priesthood.

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:39.350
That was his interest to track the line leading to the Messiah.

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:42.350
But he did more than just gather facts.

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.350
He applied what he learned.

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.350
It touched his heart.

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:47.350
How do we know?

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:50.350
Notice in verse 10, it said,

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:56.350
after consulting the law of Jehovah and to practice it.

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:00.350
To practice it, Ezra was ready to act upon what he studied.

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:03.350
What he learned stirred his feelings, touched his emotions,

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:06.350
and moved him to draw closer to Jehovah God.

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:09.350
That was his whole goal of studying.

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:11.350
And then he acted to help his brothers.

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:12.350
He did move to Jerusalem.

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:14.350
He acted. He did it.

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:19.350
In spite of the inconveniences and the problems that he would be facing.

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:24.350
But now let's look at chapter 8 and verse 22.

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:27.350
Just to highlight again how he was moved by what he read.

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:30.350
It's just not a fact-finding mission.

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:33.350
Chapter 8, verse 22.

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:37.350
It says here that he was ready to leave Babylon

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:39.350
and move to Jerusalem.

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:41.350
And speaking to the king, he said,

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:44.350
I was ashamed to ask the king for soldiers

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:47.350
and horsemen to protect us against the enemies along the way.

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:49.350
I'm ashamed to do that.

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:52.350
Because we had said to the king the good hand of our God

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:54.350
is over all those seeking him.

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:58.350
His strength is against all those that are against him.

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:00.350
I was ashamed.

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:01.350
What's the point?

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:05.350
Well, as he again tracked those Judean kings

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:07.350
because that's what first and second Chronicle does.

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:11.350
It tracks the Judean kings leading to the Messiah.

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:15.350
So imagine how he meditated when he got to David

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:18.350
or Hezekiah.

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:20.350
185,000 Assyrians killed in one night.

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:22.350
What about Josiah?

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:23.350
What about Asa?

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:25.350
A million Ethiopians killed.

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:27.350
What about Jehoshaphat?

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:30.350
Combined enemies of Moab and Edom and so forth.

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:33.350
And Amen came up against Jehoshaphat.

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:35.350
And yet Jehovah defended them.

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:37.350
He had this in his mind.

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:39.350
And that's why he said, I'm ashamed

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:41.350
because of what I've studied.

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:44.350
No, I don't need an escort, dear king.

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:46.350
Jehovah is going to be with us.

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:49.350
So it just shows the same point for us when we study.

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:51.350
And it's part of our worship.

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:54.350
And we study to draw close to Jehovah God.

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:58.350
Not simply to gather facts, but to allow our attachment

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:01.350
to Jehovah God to get stronger.

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:03.350
Example, the Watchtower study.

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:05.350
Yes, we study the Watchtower.

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:07.350
But is it just to find an answer?

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:09.350
Is it that I need to make a comment?

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:12.350
That's not why we study the Watchtower magazine.

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:14.350
It's part of pure worship.

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:16.350
It's being fed by the faithful and discreet slave.

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:17.350
We read the Watchtower.

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:19.350
We open the scriptures to draw close to Jehovah God.

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:22.350
And in the meantime, yes, I found an answer.

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:23.350
I can make a comment.

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:27.350
But our primary goal is to feed our hearts.

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:29.350
How do I feel about what I'm reading?

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:30.350
We prepare our hearts.

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:33.350
What is my motive in studying the lesson?

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:37.350
Each time we open up God's word, our attitude should be like...

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:39.350
Like Samuel, who was told,

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:45.350
speak Jehovah for your servant is listening.

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:49.350
Ezra also was given insight and understanding.

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:52.350
And that enabled him to be a blessing to the nation

00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:54.350
as he dug deep into God's word.

00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:58.350
For example, chapter 9 and verse 2.

00:07:58.350 --> 00:08:00.350
He recognized when he got there to Jerusalem

00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:04.350
that the Holy offspring was being mingled with the pagan nations.

00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:06.350
The men were marrying these pagan women.

00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:10.350
Ezra saw the disastrous consequences.

00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:14.350
You're going to mingle the holy seed along with pagan women.

00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:18.350
You're going to assimilate the whole nation into a pagan environment.

00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:20.350
You're going to merge true worship.

00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:23.350
It could vanish from the earth in time if not careful.

00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:26.350
You wouldn't be able to locate the Messiah, the lineage,

00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:28.350
is either the line of David.

00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:30.350
What we don't know is you have the tribe of Judah.

00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:32.350
We don't know. Ezra saw that.

00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:37.350
And he acted because of the insight that Jehovah God gave him.

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:40.350
Now, notice chapter 10 and verse 1.

00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:45.350
Because it again gives us insight into the beauty of Ezra's personality.

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:50.350
When he did act on it and got rid of those foreign wives,

00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:52.350
chapter 10 and verse 1.

00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:56.350
His humble confession before Jehovah God.

00:08:56.350 --> 00:09:00.350
And what happens when he humbly prays to Jehovah?

00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:04.350
A large crowd of men and women and children of Jerusalem

00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:07.350
gathered around him and were weeping.

00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:09.350
That's Ezra.

00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:13.350
They did not cringe and retreat before a tyrant.

00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:17.350
Rather, they were drawn to a loving shepherd.
