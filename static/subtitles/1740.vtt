WEBVTT

00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:05.570
Although our financial contributions are important,

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:09.570
those that volunteer on construction projects

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.570
know that money alone cannot make it successful.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.570
We met a brother from Micronesia

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.609
who has a experience with such projects,

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:24.210
and he has seen what he believes

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.850
is clearly Jehovah's Hand in Matters.

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.850
The buildings that we construct

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.850
are vital in accomplishing Jehovah's will.

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:38.850
Without the financial support

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.850
from the brothers and sisters,

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.850
we wouldn't have the funds needed

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:44.850
to make these projects happen,

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.850
but Jehovah's support far outweighs

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.850
any financial support that's given.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.850
You can't replace that with anything.

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.850
My name is Travis Brooks.

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.850
My wife, Lacey, and I serve in Micronesia.

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.850
Our assignment is serving in the LDC department,

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.849
which is a local design construction department.

00:01:05.849 --> 00:01:08.849
We care for all the islands of Micronesia.

00:01:08.849 --> 00:01:10.849
It covers the same distance

00:01:10.849 --> 00:01:12.849
from California to New York,

00:01:12.849 --> 00:01:15.849
but if you took all those islands and put them together,

00:01:15.849 --> 00:01:17.849
they would be smaller than the state of Rhode Island,

00:01:17.849 --> 00:01:23.120
so it's very vast and spread out.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.120
We've seen Jehovah's Hand

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.120
many times throughout the years

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.120
on our projects.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.120
One that stands out to us

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:35.120
is the riot congregation in particular.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.120
This congregation had been meeting in a house

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.120
for a number of years,

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.120
and they'd have 70, 80, 90,

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.120
and attendance at times,

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.120
but they would sit outside

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.120
because they couldn't fit in the house,

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.120
and many of them would listen through the window

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.120
or observe through the door,

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.120
through the rain,

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.120
and they'd have a tarp set up

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.120
just to try to keep dry.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.120
So we found this piece of property,

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.120
but the problem was that the government

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.120
had just placed a ban on

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.120
dredging sand and coral

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.120
out of the ocean or off the beaches.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:06.120
Without having that,

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.120
we wouldn't be able to mix our concrete

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.120
to accomplish our project.

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.120
So there was one company on the island

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.120
that had stockpiled sand and aggregate.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.120
We had gone to them a number of times

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.120
telling them asking them

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.120
if we could purchase just eight yards

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.120
of cement for our footings

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.120
so that we could at least get started.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.120
And they kept denying our request

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.120
and the construction overseer and myself

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.120
decided we'd go one more time

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.120
to that cement company

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.120
and plead our case with them.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.120
And we pulled into the parking lot

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.120
of the company and discussed

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.120
maybe what we could say

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.120
to convince them to at least sell us

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.120
the eight yards that we needed.

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.120
We made it a matter of prayer again

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.120
and we both exited the vehicle

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.120
and as we were approaching

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.120
the doors of the company

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.120
as the blue pickup pulled in

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.120
and kind of intercepted us.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.120
The gentleman, local man,

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.120
hopped out of his truck

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.120
and said,

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.120
can I help you?

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.120
And he was the man who was in charge.

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.120
Well, we explained our situation

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.120
and he said,

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.120
well, you'll have your concrete

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.120
the next morning.

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.120
What was interesting about that

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.120
and which really made us feel like

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.120
Jova had a hand in the matter

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.120
was that gentleman had just flown

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.120
in the night before

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.120
from another island.

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.120
He'd been gone for quite some time.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.120
He had pulled in,

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.120
talked to us,

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.120
and then hop back in his truck

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.120
and drove away.

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.120
So we wondered,

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.120
why did he pull in in the first place?

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.120
Well, we didn't want to argue with it.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.120
We just took advantage of the situation

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.120
and the next morning,

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.120
seven o'clock, the truck rolled in

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.120
and we poured our fillings.

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.120
So we kept moving forward

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.120
with the project until we got to that stage

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.120
where we would need to fill

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.120
the blockwork with 80 yards of sand

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.120
on an island with no sand.

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.120
So again, we made it a matter of prayer

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.120
and knew that if, again,

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.120
Jova wanted to build,

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.120
it would be built.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.120
So we scoured the island again

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.120
to see if there was anybody willing

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.120
and we were unsuccessful.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.120
So on our way back to the construction site

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.120
and the construction overseer

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.120
and I stopped at a store

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.120
to purchase something.

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.120
And we were talking to the gentleman

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.120
behind the counter,

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.120
explaining the situation to him

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.120
and the man asked,

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.120
well, how much sand do you need?

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.120
And we told him,

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.120
oh, 80 yards,

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.120
which is quite a bit.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.120
And the man said,

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.120
well, I have 90 yards in my backyard.

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.120
I don't have anything to do with it.

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.120
So you're more than welcome to it.

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.120
And he said, when do you need it?

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.120
He said, well, we need it tomorrow morning.

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.120
And the man said, well, I have a dump truck too.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.120
So I'll see you in the morning.

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.120
Well, the next morning he showed up

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.120
and we were able to fill that area

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.720
and move on with the project.

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.720
Another experience that really stands out to me is

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.720
an experience we had on the island of Yap.

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.720
We were doing a renovation

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.720
of a remote translation office

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.720
and an extension of the Kingdom Hall

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.720
because of the growth that they've had in the congregation.

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.720
They've outgrown their Kingdom Hall.

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.720
So for that extension,

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:20.720
we would need cement and sand for backfill.

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.720
And again, this was an island,

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.720
which is ironic that you can't really get sand on,

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.720
because there's no companies that sell it.

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.720
So what you do is you go from village to village,

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.720
asking the village chief

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:37.720
if he would be willing to sell sand off of his beach.

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.720
Well, after visiting all the villages,

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:44.720
no one was willing to sell any of their sand that we needed.

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.720
Until we reached the last village,

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.720
which was willing to sell the sand.

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.720
But the problem was there was a dispute

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.720
between two chiefs that bordered that beach.

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:55.720
And one chief said,

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:57.720
though, that's my sand, the other one,

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:58.720
said it was his sand.

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.720
Well, they couldn't come to an agreement,

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:03.720
so they weren't willing to sell the sand to us.

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.720
So we were at the stage

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.720
where we were getting ready to need it

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.720
a few days so we could move forward

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.720
with the extension of the Kingdom Hall.

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.720
At that point, things got worse

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:16.720
because there was a typhoon approaching the island.

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.720
So we just had the construction crew stop work.

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.720
So the next morning,

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:23.720
we were able to get in contact

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:25.720
with a construction overseer on the island.

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:28.720
And he said, I've got really good news.

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:29.720
There was no damage.

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:32.720
The storm took a turn just before it hit the island

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.720
and just grazed it.

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:36.720
He says, I have some other good news.

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:40.720
And I just got a call from the village chiefs.

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.720
Apparently, the storm surge

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:45.720
had washed up a bunch of sand

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:47.720
over their road to their villages

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:49.720
and they had no way of removing it.

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:52.720
So they said, we have plenty of sand.

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:54.720
Can you come and help us get rid of it?

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:56.720
So we ended up having enough sand

00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:00.800
for the rest of the project.

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.800
Jehovah's Blessing

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.800
is the most important thing

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:05.800
that we can have on our projects

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.800
from the start to the finish.

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:10.800
There will be no obstacle

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:12.800
that can be put before you,

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.800
that you can't overcome.

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:16.800
And we've seen that time and again.

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:19.800
The finances is an important part of the project

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:21.800
to include when you're thinking about

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:23.800
what projects you're going to do next

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:25.800
and how you're going to accomplish it.

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.800
But financial support

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:29.800
doesn't create the loving atmosphere

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:31.800
that we find on these projects.

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:33.800
It doesn't create unity.

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:35.800
It doesn't motivate ones

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:37.800
to want to serve Jehovah

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.800
and work hard day in and day out

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:41.800
together with their brothers and sisters.

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:44.800
That's where Jehovah's Spirit comes in.

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.800
That's what's moving our brothers and sisters.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:49.800
That's what motivates us to work hard together.

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:51.800
Without Jehovah's Hand in it,

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:52.800
like we've seen,

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:56.800
we wouldn't accomplish what we've been able to accomplish.
