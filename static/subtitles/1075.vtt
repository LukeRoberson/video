00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:05.910
Many people believe in God, in what sense?

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.910
They believe that there must exist a God, a Creator.

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:13.910
She illogicals them to believe this.

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:14.910
Why?

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.910
Because of being aware that there is creation.

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:24.910
If the Creator would not exist, no creation would exist.

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:30.320
Why? Because nothing comes from nothing.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.320
This is also why we know that God has always existed.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.320
If there would have been a time when He did not exist,

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.700
then nothing would exist today.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:49.700
The fact that creation exists proves there must be a Creator.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.700
It also shows that God exists from all eternity.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:59.700
Although with our imperfect human mind, we have a hard time grasping this.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:04.040
We are the product of His creation.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.040
But is it enough to believe in Him as the Creator?

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.040
Because without Creator there could be no creation?

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.040
No.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.040
Is it enough for a child to believe He has a Father?

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.040
Because without Father He would not exist?

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.040
No.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.040
A child should love His Father.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:32.040
A Father normally loves and cares for His children.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.040
The Creator, our Father, not only cares about His creation,

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:44.040
but He also loves us and cares for us as individuals.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.040
He cares about you.

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.040
Jehovah God loves you.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.040
Do you love Him?

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.040
Are you a lover of God?

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.040
This is not automatic.

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.040
The Apostle Paul says in 2 Timothy 3, 4,

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:10.039
that most people in this time of the end would be lovers of pleasures

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:14.580
rather than lovers of God.

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.580
Sometimes we may have feelings of worthlessness

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.580
and such feelings could dampen our zeal in serving Jehovah.

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.580
Dampen our love or even could cause us to stop serving Him.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:35.580
Therefore we need to build up and deeply our love and trust in Jehovah.

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.080
Jehovah loves mankind.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.080
What evidence is there for that?

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.080
We see Jehovah's love in nature.

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:53.080
He created numerous trees, plants and flowers so that we can enjoy them.

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.080
He created for us not only things that we need to keep living,

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:04.080
but things that impress our hearts with awe and love for God,

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.080
the giver of every good gift.

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:14.520
Man is not able to create one single animal or even fruit and flower.

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:22.520
The things God created help us to live and enjoy living for as long as we do.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:28.520
But Jehovah loves mankind so much that he gave his firstborn spirit son

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:35.520
whom we came to know as Jesus Christ, as ransom for the sins of us imperfect humans,

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:43.520
for those who love Him so they may live and enjoy God's love forever.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:49.219
Although the first humans rebelled against Jehovah God,

00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:57.219
Jehovah knew that there would be many others who would choose to serve Him out of love.

00:03:57.219 --> 00:04:02.219
Please turn with me to John chapter 6.

00:04:02.219 --> 00:04:10.819
You are listening in to this program is proof not only of your love for Jehovah God and Jesus,

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:17.819
but also of their love for you as an individual.

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:25.639
In John chapter 6, 44, Jesus said,

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:31.639
No man can come to me unless the father who sent me draws him.

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:39.779
The scriptures show that Jehovah has given humans free will.

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:44.779
Everyone has a choice when it comes to serving Him.

00:04:44.779 --> 00:04:51.779
God gently draws to Himself those who have a heart that is rightly disposed.

00:04:51.779 --> 00:04:59.180
Jehovah does so through the Bible's message and through His Holy Spirit.

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:02.180
How does Jehovah draw us?

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:10.180
The Greek verb rendered draw is used in reference to hauling in a net of fishes.

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:16.180
Does Jehovah drag us against our will, forcing us to serve Him?

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:22.180
No. Jehovah gave us free will so He does not force our heart open.

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:26.180
One scholar puts it this way.

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:31.180
There is no handle on the outside of the door of the human heart.

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:35.910
It must be open from within.

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:46.769
Jehovah searches through the billions of hearts in this world looking for individuals who are inclined toward Him.

00:05:46.769 --> 00:05:50.769
When He finds such a person, He responds in a touching way.

00:05:50.769 --> 00:05:54.769
Are you such a person?

00:05:54.769 --> 00:05:57.769
We trust you are.

00:05:57.769 --> 00:06:06.769
Jehovah gently attracts or tugs at the heart of ones who are rightly disposed.

00:06:06.769 --> 00:06:14.769
Jehovah does so in two ways through the Bible's message of good news and through His Holy Spirit.

00:06:14.769 --> 00:06:19.769
When Jehovah sees a heart that is responsive to Bible truth,

00:06:19.769 --> 00:06:28.050
He uses His Spirit to help the individual to grasp and apply that truth in his life.

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:37.050
Without divine help, we could never become genuine followers of Jesus and devoted worshipers of Jehovah.

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:46.050
Jehovah draws people because he sees something good in their heart and cares about them as individuals.

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:57.050
Does knowing that Jehovah cares about His worshipers as individuals move you to want to open the door of your heart and open it wide?

00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:13.110
As you watch the following video, notice how a brother named Carlos came to appreciate that Jehovah is the loving father whom he had always yearned for.

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:24.459
When I went through difficult times during my childhood, Jehovah was like my father. He was my refuge.

00:07:24.459 --> 00:07:35.889
The first memory I have of my dad is when I went to visit him in the prison where he was being held.

00:07:35.889 --> 00:07:45.490
I asked Jehovah so many times for my dad to come back home.

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:51.899
One day, my mom said, Dad's coming home today.

00:07:51.899 --> 00:07:55.899
I went to school and when I came back, he was there.

00:07:55.899 --> 00:07:59.899
I thought he was finally back for good and that it would be forever.

00:07:59.899 --> 00:08:17.060
But soon after that, I heard my mom and my grandmother crying and they started to explain that my dad was back in prison.

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:29.300
From then on, I felt hatred, resentment and anger toward my dad and also towards Jehovah.

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:34.299
I started to take drugs, to leading in moral and violent lifestyle.

00:08:34.299 --> 00:08:44.700
One day, a couple of sisters gave me a magazine.

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:48.700
As I was looking through it, I saw the experience of all Dustin.

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:58.549
I began to think about the times during my childhood when I would take refuge in Jehovah and would feel the same way Dustin did.

00:08:58.549 --> 00:09:05.899
I would say, Jehovah is there. He hasn't abandoned me. Dustin never doubted Jehovah's love.

00:09:05.899 --> 00:09:10.659
Right up into the day he died.

00:09:10.659 --> 00:09:14.659
That very night, I prayed to Jehovah.

00:09:14.659 --> 00:09:24.600
I asked him to forgive me because it wasn't his fault.

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:28.600
That night, I poured out all my feelings through Jehovah.

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:39.100
That burden that I felt was finally gone.

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:42.100
I felt Jehovah's love every step of the way.

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:45.100
He showed it through the brothers who didn't judge me for what I had done.

00:09:45.100 --> 00:10:01.980
It doesn't matter how many problems we have or how far we've drifted away from Jehovah.

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:12.139
He never abandoned us.

00:10:12.139 --> 00:10:18.139
Jehovah has lovingly helped many brothers and sisters because of his love for them.

00:10:18.139 --> 00:10:26.139
This can reassure you that Jehovah will help you as well because Jehovah loves you too.

00:10:26.139 --> 00:10:32.389
Did you notice how Jehovah demonstrated his love for Carlos?

00:10:32.389 --> 00:10:37.389
Through his worshipers, Jehovah lovingly cared for this young man.

00:10:38.389 --> 00:10:43.960
Please turn with me to Psalm 119.

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:49.960
Jehovah had not forgotten Carlos, even though he had strayed for a time.

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:56.960
This reminds us of the words in Psalm 119 verse 176.

00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:00.960
I have strayed like a lost sheep.

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:06.960
Search for your servant, for I have not forgotten your commandments.

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:14.960
There are indications that Psalm 119 may have been written by young Prince Hezekiah.

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:20.960
Hezekiah poured out his heart to Jehovah and Jehovah responded.

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:29.960
Brothers and sisters, please pour out your heart to Jehovah and take note of how he will answer your prayers.

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:36.460
Please turn with me to Ephesians chapter 3.

00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:43.460
Jehovah can and will intervene positively in your life.

00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:48.460
Notice what it says at Ephesians 3 verse 20.

00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:53.460
Now to the one who can, according to his power that is operating in us,

00:11:53.460 --> 00:12:02.870
do more than super abundantly beyond all the things we ask or conceive.

00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:12.870
The expression, his power that is operating in us, is this not something very encouraging and faith strengthening?

00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:19.870
His power is not just operating in us, but operating in us super abundantly.

00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:27.870
No, but more than super abundantly beyond what we can envision or comprehend.

00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:32.870
He will draw close to you, says James 4 verse 8.

00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:40.870
Whether he wrote Psalm 119 or not, Hezekiah strengthened his faith in Jehovah and trusted him.

00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:50.220
He did so even though he was surrounded by false worshipers and may have been ridiculed by members of the royal court.

00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:53.220
Jehovah blessed Hezekiah.

00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:57.220
If you trust Jehovah, he will bless you as well.

00:12:57.220 --> 00:13:05.220
With reliance on God, you too can endure trials as integrity keepers.

00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:14.220
Apply Bible principles in your life and see how following Jehovah's advice will always work out for your good.

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:25.559
Strong faith in God's love helps us to see beyond our imperfections or negative experiences that we may have had in the past.

00:13:25.559 --> 00:13:32.559
We see ourselves the way Jehovah sees us as cherished part of his household.

00:13:32.559 --> 00:13:38.559
We are a family member of Jehovah's family.

00:13:38.559 --> 00:13:48.559
Notice the encouragement we received, Psalm 119 verse 132.

00:13:48.559 --> 00:13:56.320
Faith in God's love gives us the confidence that we need to keep going.

00:13:56.320 --> 00:14:01.320
In Psalm 119, verse 32, it says,

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:14.200
I will eagerly pursue the way of your commandments because you may groom for it in my heart.

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:19.200
The footnote says, or possibly you make my heart have the confidence.

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:23.200
We will be able to endure any trial.

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:28.200
Are there things that can separate us from Jehovah's love toward us?

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:34.450
Do you recall what we are told at Romans chapter 8?

00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:40.450
Nothing can separate us from Jehovah's love toward us.

00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:50.450
Let's read this together in Romans chapter 8 and 35 to 39.

00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:58.899
Who will separate us from the love of the Christ?

00:14:58.899 --> 00:15:05.899
Will tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or hunger, or nakedness, or danger, or sword?

00:15:05.899 --> 00:15:11.899
Just as it is written, for your sake we are being put to death all day long.

00:15:11.899 --> 00:15:17.899
We have been accounted as sheep for slaughtering on the contrary.

00:15:17.899 --> 00:15:25.899
All these things we are coming off completely victorious through the one who loved us.

00:15:25.899 --> 00:15:30.899
For I am convinced that neither death nor life, nor angels, nor governments,

00:15:30.899 --> 00:15:35.899
nor things now, nor things to come, nor powers, nor height, nor depths, nor any other creation,

00:15:35.899 --> 00:15:45.889
will be able to separate us from God's love that is in Christ Jesus, our Lord.

00:15:45.889 --> 00:15:54.889
But there are things that can diminish or kill our love for Jehovah, so we need to be careful.

00:15:54.889 --> 00:16:05.889
This symposium has reminded us of why we have faith in God's existence, His Word, His moral standards, and His love.

00:16:05.889 --> 00:16:14.889
As the world around us grows more hopeless, we are determined to become more and more powerful by faith,

00:16:14.889 --> 00:16:20.389
about Abraham, Romans 420 says.

00:16:20.389 --> 00:16:26.389
But because of the promise of God, He did not waver in a lack of faith,

00:16:26.389 --> 00:16:31.389
but He became powerful by His faith, giving God glory.

00:16:31.389 --> 00:16:36.389
Similarly, Jehovah has also given promises to us,

00:16:36.389 --> 00:16:45.389
and as He progressively fulfills them, we become more and more powerful by our faith and give glory,

00:16:45.389 --> 00:16:48.389
to Jehovah God.
