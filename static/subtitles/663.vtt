00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.250
And March of this year, Connie and I had the privilege of visiting the branches in Ecuador and Chile.

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:10.849
Our first stop was Chile.

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:17.250
The country of Chile measures 2,700 miles from its northernmost point to its southernmost.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.850
So if we could take the country of Chile and lay it across the contiguous United States,

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:28.850
Chile would come only about 100 miles short of meeting the United States distance from end to end.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:35.649
This geography provides for a remarkable variety of climates and landscapes within the country.

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:44.450
The branch office is located in the capital city Santiago, where about 130 brothers and sisters are serving.

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:49.350
One of the first to preach in Chile was an anointed sister, K. Palm.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.450
Originally from Germany, she arrived in Chile in 1936,

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:59.450
and she preached from Chile's northernmost town to its southernmost.

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:06.250
She showed remarkable courage and zeal as a single sister to preach over those thousands of miles.

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:15.849
Sister Palm witnessed to those in sulfur camps in the Andes Mountains, men in silver mines, sheep ragers, and many others.

00:01:15.849 --> 00:01:21.849
Interestingly, not too long ago, Sister Palm's niece, who is not one of Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:01:21.849 --> 00:01:25.849
approached a metropolitan witnessing card in Germany.

00:01:25.849 --> 00:01:30.750
And she said that she had heard about her aunt and some of the work that she had done in Chile,

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.549
and she was planning a visit to that country.

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:42.250
So the brothers contacted the Chile branch, and the branch arranged for those who knew a lot about Sister Palm to spend time with this niece.

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:47.950
And she learned all about her aunt's hard work and courageous activity throughout Chile.

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:53.150
And the niece was moved to hear about all of her aunt's hard work.

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.349
When Sister Palm arrived in Chile, there were 50 publishers in the country.

00:01:57.349 --> 00:02:03.450
And last year, the peak number of publishers was about 78,500.

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.450
Jehovah certainly blessed the work.

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.650
One of the territories assigned to the Chile branch is Easter Island,

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:15.949
located more than 2,000 miles off the Chilean coast.

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:22.849
And although being a remote island in the South Pacific, the good news is reaching that part of the Earth.

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:30.150
For example, notice the experience of this sister, Sister Patricia Riroco.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.150
A number of years ago, when Patricia was studying and decided to get baptized,

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.650
her mother was so upset and so opposed, she put Patricia out of the house.

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.750
And when Patricia's father approved of her decision to get baptized,

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:48.819
her mother threw the husband out too.

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:57.120
Years went by and in 2010, Patricia suffered the loss of her son in a tragic accident.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:03.719
But when her mother saw the kindness and the love and the support from the brothers to her daughter,

00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:06.319
she began studying the Bible.

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:10.020
And as for Patricia, despite the problems she's had,

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:13.819
she is enjoying very much serving as a translator,

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:17.819
helping our literature to get into the Rapa, a Rapa Nui language,

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:20.919
one of the two languages spoken on this island.

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:24.819
She loves translating, she feels so fulfilled in doing it,

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:26.620
and she sees the results.

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.520
In the past, some of her Bible students stopped studying,

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.020
but when Patricia had some literature in their own language, Rapa Nui,

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:37.819
she went back, they resumed the studying, and the students said,

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:41.020
we're finally understanding the truth.

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:48.620
On March 14th, a special meeting was held, originated from the L-Trabel assembly hall shown here.

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.620
In addition to those in attendance at the assembly hall,

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.819
for the first time in Chile's history,

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:58.120
the special meeting was streamed throughout the entire branch territory.

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:03.020
The total attendance was 97,809.

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:05.419
And at the conclusion of our visit,

00:04:05.419 --> 00:04:10.919
the Bethel family in Chile requested that their warm love and greetings be shared with all of you.

00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:14.919
Our next stop was Ecuador.

00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:18.319
The branch is located near the city of Guayaquil,

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:22.519
and as you can see, it's well maintained and it's a beautiful setting.

00:04:22.519 --> 00:04:27.319
There are about 190 brothers and sisters working there at Bethel.

00:04:27.319 --> 00:04:30.319
We'd like to share some experiences from Ecuador with you.

00:04:30.319 --> 00:04:34.019
The first is from the city of Coenca.

00:04:34.019 --> 00:04:39.019
A woman there entered the business place of a brother a few years ago,

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.819
and she noticed the track, the end of false religion.

00:04:43.819 --> 00:04:46.420
She picked it up and said to the brother,

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:49.420
how wonderful this is going to be when this happens,

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:52.819
and especially to those Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:55.620
I can't stand them.

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:00.319
The brother asked the woman if she had ever had an opportunity to talk with Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:02.720
and she said, no, nor do I want to.

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.519
I wish they would disappear.

00:05:04.519 --> 00:05:06.620
They're always coming to my door.

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.220
I never listened to them, and I never will.

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:13.819
The brother said, well, I have some news for you.

00:05:13.819 --> 00:05:16.220
I'm one of Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:19.319
and she was so shocked and so ashamed

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:23.220
that she left immediately without saying another word.

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:27.319
But the next day, she came back to our brother's business place

00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:31.120
to apologize, and she wanted the track.

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.319
And the brother also placed with her

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:35.720
my book of Bible stories.

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:37.519
And she said, well, how much does this cost?

00:05:37.519 --> 00:05:38.920
And he says, well, there's no cost.

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:40.019
Why don't you read it?

00:05:40.019 --> 00:05:44.620
If you enjoy it, you can bring back a donation to the worldwide work.

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:47.720
Well, a week later, she came back with a donation,

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:51.720
and she says, this book is fabulous.

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:56.319
My husband is reading it to our children every night.

00:05:56.319 --> 00:06:01.019
Well, due to work issues, the woman and her family moved to another city.

00:06:01.019 --> 00:06:03.019
But when the brother was saying goodbye to her,

00:06:03.019 --> 00:06:05.220
he says, now I have a request.

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:07.620
The next time witnesses call it your home

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:11.420
and your new place, listen to them.

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:17.220
Well, about three years went by, and at an assembly,

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:22.420
this woman with her children came up to the brother and said,

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:26.720
I'm the woman who said, I can't stand Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.819
But she says, I complied with your request.

00:06:29.819 --> 00:06:32.319
When they knocked on my door, I listened.

00:06:32.319 --> 00:06:36.519
I enjoyed it, and look, here I am at this assembly.

00:06:36.519 --> 00:06:39.120
My husband supports us in our Bible study.

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:45.620
They regularly attend meetings and their family is showing clear love for Jehovah.

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:49.920
Another experience is about metropolitan preaching work.

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:55.720
A man walked by the cart and the signs at the cart caught his attention.

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:58.519
He turned around and began to look at it.

00:06:58.519 --> 00:07:00.720
And the sister there approached him

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.920
and asked if he needed some information.

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:06.519
And he says, well, no, I'm going to undercover policeman.

00:07:06.519 --> 00:07:07.920
I never come down this way.

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:10.420
I don't know why I came down this way today.

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:13.620
But this cart caught my attention.

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:16.220
Well, that led to a 45-minute discussion,

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:19.620
and our sister was able to explain a lot of answers

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:21.319
for his Bible questions.

00:07:21.319 --> 00:07:23.920
Well, the next day, this policeman came back

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:26.319
and a brother at the carts had a study with him

00:07:26.319 --> 00:07:29.220
for a half hour in the Bible Teachbook.

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:32.220
The brother made arrangements to the meeting at his home to continue the study

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:37.019
and as the man was leaving the cart, he took the family happiness book.

00:07:37.019 --> 00:07:40.819
But he sat down just a little away from the cart began reading it.

00:07:40.819 --> 00:07:44.519
And just a little while later, the brother at the cart looked over there

00:07:44.519 --> 00:07:48.319
and this man was witnessing to other people in the street

00:07:48.319 --> 00:07:51.420
about what he had been learning.

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:58.019
Well, sometimes the response at these carts may not be a Bible study,

00:07:58.019 --> 00:08:00.819
but it may be funny sometimes.

00:08:00.819 --> 00:08:04.620
A missionary at a stand noticed a woman staring intently

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:10.420
at the cover of an awake magazine that showed a woman holding a child.

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:15.220
And this woman stared so long at the cover of this awake

00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:21.120
that the missionary thought, wow, this woman must have a very profound question on her mind.

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:24.819
So he went up to her and he says, what are you thinking?

00:08:24.819 --> 00:08:30.620
She pointed to the woman on the magazine cover and said, I've been wondering,

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:40.950
how can I achieve the same hair color as this woman?

00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:44.250
All sorts of responses.

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:49.149
On March 21st, a special meeting was held at the assembly hall near the branch.

00:08:49.149 --> 00:08:53.049
And for the first time in Ecuador's history, the special meeting was streamed

00:08:53.049 --> 00:08:59.850
throughout the entire country, a total of 115,453 attended.

00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:03.850
And a highlight of Ecuador's theoretical history was the international convention

00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:07.450
that was held there in January this year.

00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:11.450
And it was just an evidence of Jehovah's continued blessing of the work there

00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:16.649
since the preaching work started there back in 1935.

00:09:16.649 --> 00:09:21.049
Well, back in 1994, November, brother Hinchel was in Ecuador

00:09:21.049 --> 00:09:24.950
and he was there to dedicate some expanded branch facilities.

00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:30.350
And he alluded to the growth in his dedication talk back there in 1994.

00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:34.649
At that time, when he was there, there were 26,000 publishers in Ecuador.

00:09:34.649 --> 00:09:39.149
And today, there are over 85,500.

00:09:39.149 --> 00:09:44.549
Please give your attention to this brief video that will show little excerpts

00:09:44.549 --> 00:09:49.350
from brother Hinchel's talk at that dedication program back in 1994

00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:54.350
and then will lead right on into some scenes from this year's International Convention in Quito.

00:09:54.350 --> 00:10:13.320
The real pleasure to be with the Beffel families and the brothers

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:20.820
and brothers of the people who have been here for the past 246 years.

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:28.759
It's a great pleasure to be with the brothers and brothers of the people

00:10:28.759 --> 00:11:47.200
who have been here for the past 246 years.

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:52.200
The grand total 148,246.

00:11:52.200 --> 00:12:03.590
Well, it was a real pleasure to be with the Beffel families

00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:05.289
and the brothers in these two countries.

00:12:05.289 --> 00:12:06.889
We thoroughly enjoyed it.

00:12:06.889 --> 00:12:10.590
And all along the way, they expressed sincere appreciation for all the work

00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:13.590
the governing body is doing in their behalf and the support

00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:15.690
that the Beffel family here provides as well.

00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:19.889
So to all of you, warm loving greetings from Chile and Ecuador.
