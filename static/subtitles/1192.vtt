00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:07.870
Throughout my childhood, I didn't receive the love a child should have from his family.

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:12.869
I lost my father to alcoholism when I was very young.

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:15.869
And then my older brother committed suicide.

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:18.870
I had to raise myself.

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:24.870
Growing up, I was often beaten and I saw scenes of horrible violence.

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:27.870
As a result, I became a drug addict.

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:32.869
This loveless upbringing made me a very violent person,

00:00:32.869 --> 00:00:36.869
unable to love and trust anyone.

00:00:36.869 --> 00:00:38.869
I was depressed.

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:44.869
I couldn't have a normal, happy life like everyone else.

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:49.869
One night, Joseph came home, completely drunk.

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:52.869
He set the apartment on fire.

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:55.869
And in one night, we lost everything we had.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.280
I had been studying the Bible for just a few months

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.280
when the sister gave me an envelope full of cash.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.280
The local congregation wanted to help us buy

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.659
well, everything we had lost.

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:19.659
I thought it's incredible that people who don't even know me

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:23.659
can show such deep love and affection.

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:26.659
So I met with two brothers that same evening

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:30.659
and I asked them, can God really forgive my sins?

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:36.099
They showed me first Corinthians 6, 9 through 11.

00:01:36.099 --> 00:01:41.099
At that moment, I realized that I could change.

00:01:41.099 --> 00:01:43.099
I had found the truth.

00:01:43.099 --> 00:01:46.099
With Joseph's help, I was able to give up drugs,

00:01:46.099 --> 00:01:50.099
alcohol and cigarettes in three months.

00:01:50.099 --> 00:01:54.859
Today, I'm a very happy man.

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:57.859
I have learned to trust people,

00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:02.859
to become a loving husband and a caring father.

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:05.859
Despite my loveless upbringing,

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:08.860
Jehovah showed me that love never fails.
