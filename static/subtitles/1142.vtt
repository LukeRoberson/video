00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:09.820
For anyone to become a servant of Jehovah, they must have God's word deeply implanted

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:11.900
in their hearts.

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.699
Now why is it so necessary for us to understand that?

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:20.660
And what skills will help us to reach the heart of our students?

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.420
Jesus gave an indication in His illustration of the Sore.

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:31.940
It's found in Matthew chapter 13, and we'll read verse 19.

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:41.259
It says, where anyone hears the word of the kingdom, but does not get the sense of it,

00:00:41.259 --> 00:00:47.539
the wicked one comes and snatches away what has been sown in his heart.

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:55.659
So the word of the kingdom is likened to seeds and the soil to the figurative heart.

00:00:55.659 --> 00:00:59.259
Now the figurative heart represents what a person is inside.

00:00:59.259 --> 00:01:05.459
It involves his feelings, his affections, his desires, his motives, also what he thinks

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:10.340
about and how those thoughts affect decisions in his life.

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:16.420
If you look back at verse 19, Jesus said that the seed in this case didn't grow because

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:21.099
the individual didn't get the sense of the good news.

00:01:21.099 --> 00:01:27.299
Now Jesus has given all of us this assignment to make disciples of people of all nations

00:01:27.379 --> 00:01:28.980
and baptizing them.

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:35.260
So our teaching needs to help our students get the sense of the good news, and that's

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.219
going to move them to action.

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:46.340
Proverbs chapter 3 and verse 1 highlights an importance of this type of teaching to us.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.939
It's Proverbs 3 and verse 1.

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:58.379
Jesus says, my son, do not forget my teaching and may your heart observe my commandments.

00:01:58.379 --> 00:02:04.219
So obedience to God must come from the heart as it indicates.

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:11.219
So brothers and sisters, it's our responsibility to learn how to reach the heart of our students

00:02:11.219 --> 00:02:17.979
so that their thinking, their feelings, their reasonings will move them to be obedient

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:20.219
to Jehovah God.

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:26.379
As you watch the following dramatization, notice how Nita strives to reach the heart of

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:29.819
her Bible student.

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:33.500
Think any more about what we talked about on Monday?

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.500
I did.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.659
But why would Jehovah make a rule like that?

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:41.340
No sex unless you're married.

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:50.539
It's totally okay, it might seem odd, but what quality do you most appreciate about Jehovah?

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:53.620
His love, me too.

00:02:53.620 --> 00:03:02.680
So if he truly loves us, look at what he tells us at Isaiah 48 verse 17.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:10.699
I Jehovah am your God, your God, Jade.

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:17.259
The one teaching you to benefit yourself, the one guiding you in the way you should walk.

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:26.870
I don't get it, it just doesn't make sense.

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:37.150
Does a little child always understand why mum and dad warns them not to do certain things?

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.150
Probably not.

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.550
So why all the rules and warnings?

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:46.849
Well, they love them, don't they?

00:03:46.849 --> 00:04:01.770
And so if Jehovah loves you, it often takes time to appreciate why Jehovah asked certain things of us.

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:13.870
But if we really love him, we'll have faith that what he asks is for the best.

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.540
The real question is, do you trust him?

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:26.040
I won't do.

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.040
I really do.

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:42.399
This was a good example of how a Bible study conductor reaches the heart of a student.

00:04:42.399 --> 00:04:50.399
Anita was calmly helping Jade to link what she was learning in her study to her relationship with Jehovah God.

00:04:50.399 --> 00:04:58.399
It was not an intellectual exercise, so to speak, helping her to gain more knowledge about a certain subject.

00:04:58.399 --> 00:05:03.399
Now it's really helping the student to connect the dots, so to speak.

00:05:03.399 --> 00:05:09.399
See how the material applies to decisions that they're making in their life.

00:05:09.399 --> 00:05:16.399
Throughout the Bible study, we want to constantly direct attention to Jehovah God.

00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:21.399
And if we're talking too much as the teacher, it's going to be hard to accomplish that.

00:05:21.399 --> 00:05:34.399
Your effective use of questions can help them connect their Bible knowledge that they're receiving to the qualities of Jehovah God that's going to make them love him.

00:05:34.399 --> 00:05:40.399
This is such as his love, his goodness, and his righteousness.

00:05:40.399 --> 00:05:45.399
Here's an example of a question that might be used.

00:05:45.399 --> 00:05:51.399
Why do you think Jehovah would forbid a certain action?

00:05:51.399 --> 00:05:59.399
See, that kind of question is helping your student begin to understand the thinking of Jehovah God on matters.

00:05:59.399 --> 00:06:03.399
Did you notice it was not a yes or no question?

00:06:03.399 --> 00:06:07.399
The question actually started with why.

00:06:07.399 --> 00:06:17.399
And now that forces the student to go to another level of their thought process to explain the reason Jehovah forbids certain actions.

00:06:17.399 --> 00:06:23.399
And that's a very good method of reaching the heart of a student.

00:06:23.399 --> 00:06:26.399
Here's an example of another question.

00:06:26.399 --> 00:06:31.399
How does this show you that Jehovah is a loving father?

00:06:31.399 --> 00:06:34.399
There again, not a yes or no question.

00:06:34.399 --> 00:06:38.399
It's this time started with how.

00:06:38.399 --> 00:06:47.399
And that now requires the student to identify the evidence that proves that Jehovah is a loving father.

00:06:47.399 --> 00:06:53.399
Did you notice in the video that neatest questions were touching Jade's heart?

00:06:53.399 --> 00:07:01.399
She was skilled at her choice of questions, but also in the tone of voice when she was asking those questions.

00:07:01.399 --> 00:07:05.399
She was not hurried or impatient to get an answer.

00:07:05.399 --> 00:07:10.399
She quietly waited for Jade to meditate on the question.

00:07:10.399 --> 00:07:16.399
Her method of teaching demonstrated a Bible principle that would be helpful for us to review.

00:07:16.399 --> 00:07:25.399
And it's found in Proverbs chapter 20 and verse 5.

00:07:25.399 --> 00:07:30.399
And Proverbs 20 and verse 5.

00:07:30.399 --> 00:07:39.399
It says, the thoughts of a man's heart are like deep waters, but the discerning man draws them out.

00:07:39.399 --> 00:07:44.399
And so the thoughts of a student are not always easily discernible.

00:07:44.399 --> 00:07:53.399
Yes, it really takes a skilled teacher to draw those out like deep waters the verse indicates.

00:07:53.399 --> 00:08:02.399
Through tactful questions then, you can help your student to examine how they feel about what they are learning.

00:08:02.399 --> 00:08:06.399
Some simple questions will help you do that.

00:08:06.399 --> 00:08:19.399
For instance, how do you feel about or what convinces you that or how would you react if?

00:08:19.399 --> 00:08:25.399
See, those are excellent questions to help to draw up the inner feelings of your student.

00:08:25.399 --> 00:08:33.399
Now there's a caution in this process because generally it's going to take time to gain the trust of the student,

00:08:33.399 --> 00:08:37.399
so they'll be comfortable expressing their feelings.

00:08:37.399 --> 00:08:48.399
As the students love for Jehovah increases, they'll be motivated to make changes in their lives to please Jehovah God.

00:08:48.399 --> 00:08:57.399
First John 5 verse 3 says, this is what the love of God means that we observe His commandments.

00:08:57.399 --> 00:09:03.399
So obedience to His commandments then is linked to love for Him.

00:09:03.399 --> 00:09:14.399
And then addition, love for fellow humans, love for the Bible teachings that they're learning is going to help them to make any needed adjustments to their thinking.

00:09:14.399 --> 00:09:24.399
Rather than shame your student, help them to reason on the benefits of correcting wrong viewpoints.

00:09:24.399 --> 00:09:28.399
Do you recall how Nida handled the situation with Jade?

00:09:28.399 --> 00:09:37.399
When Jade said Jehovah's Law against having sex before marriage was totally archaic.

00:09:37.399 --> 00:09:48.399
Well, instead of scolding her, Nida skillfully used an example of a child not understanding the rules and regulations of the parent.

00:09:49.399 --> 00:10:05.970
And you could see as she was discussing that Jade started to make the connection that Jehovah's Law is really an expression of His love for her just as a parent loves their child.

00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:13.970
Once the student develops this relationship with Jehovah God and desires to make Jehovah's heart happy,

00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:25.539
that's going to be the strongest motive for the individual to make whatever changes are necessary in their life to please Jehovah.

00:10:25.539 --> 00:10:34.539
While it is a privilege to be involved in the work of making disciples, Jehovah wants us to also enjoy this work.

00:10:34.539 --> 00:10:37.539
That was certainly the case with the Apostle Paul.

00:10:38.539 --> 00:10:44.539
Open your Bible to 1 Thessalonians chapter 2, 19 and 20.

00:10:44.539 --> 00:10:52.539
And let's see how he felt about God's message changing the lives of those that he preached to.

00:10:52.539 --> 00:10:56.539
It's 1 Thessalonians 2, 19 and 20.

00:10:56.539 --> 00:11:06.159
For what is our hope or joy or crown of exultation before our Lord Jesus at His presence?

00:11:06.159 --> 00:11:13.159
Is it not in fact you? You certainly are our glory and joy.

00:11:13.159 --> 00:11:26.159
Few joys in life can compare with helping someone come to an accurate knowledge of the truth and watch them to progress to dedication and baptism.

00:11:26.159 --> 00:11:35.159
We are so thankful to receive Jehovah's Holy Spirit and His guidance in helping us in this disciple making work.

00:11:35.159 --> 00:11:42.159
But we too must do our part indiligently improving in our skills.

00:11:42.159 --> 00:11:53.159
As this six-part symposium has highlighted, as we do our part improving our teaching skills and all aspects of our ministry,

00:11:53.159 --> 00:11:59.159
we will find greater joy as God's fellow workers.
