00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:05.940
In our ministry, we try to find people no matter what obstacles lie ahead.

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.939
Unlike Nicaragua, a group of missionaries, pioneers and publishers traveled by boat

00:00:11.939 --> 00:00:17.940
to teach Bible truth to families living on hundreds of tiny islands near the city of Granada.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.940
Lake Nicaragua is the largest freshwater lake in all of Central America.

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:29.940
Here you will see stunning natural beauty and a fisherman or two.

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:38.820
But perhaps most important of all are those who are fishing for men.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.820
Reaching on a boat all day sounds very romantic, but it actually involves many, many challenges.

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.820
The person has to have a blob experience and knowledge to know where all the rocks under the water

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.820
and be able to drive safely.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:58.820
We don't have to learn just one route, we have to learn every route to reach everyone in these 365 islands.

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:06.680
I remember that one time they came, the wind was really blowing hard

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.680
and the driver ran into a big rock.

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.680
Then one of the young women aboard fell into the water.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.680
A lot of the challenges have to deal with the cost because a cost here in the boat

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.680
we had to be very well organized to find out our date.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.680
Sometimes you will go a whole morning and maybe only talk to two people.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:30.680
But sometimes when they would come to study with us, well, we didn't want to

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.680
and we would tell them that we weren't going to study.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.680
The brothers and sisters still found the encouragement to endure and many blessings as well.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.680
One thing that helps us to keep our zeal even though it's not always easy

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.680
is thinking about how much people need to learn about Jehovah

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.680
and learn about his kingdom and what's going to happen in the future.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.680
A very special scripture for me is Acts 1 verse 8,

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.680
which says that the Jews will be preached to the most distant part of you.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.680
Some older ones have helped us recognize how important modesty is to recognize your limitations

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:09.680
and to work within those boundaries and that way you can actually last longer in preaching in a territory

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:13.680
that's a bit more difficult to actually get to everything.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.680
My husband and I have benefited from being here together

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.680
because we've learned to work as a team.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:27.680
It feels good to know that we spent our years where we were able to use our energy

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.680
and all of our efforts to really be useful.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:37.680
Something that I have learned in this assignment is that it's very important not to give up.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.680
It taught me the need to be very adaptable, very patient, tolerant,

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.680
not only with the other brothers but also with myself.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:53.680
It really touched our hearts to see the enormous effort they made just to visit us at our homes.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:03:01.090
We told them, yes, we are going to study with you because you show a lot of love in coming

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.090
all the way here to our homes.

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:11.090
We were living the best of lives, so knowing Jehovah has helped us to be more united as a family,

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.090
especially for my mom and my brothers.

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:20.689
Thanks to Jehovah into the island preaching work, my sons are baptized,

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:26.770
and my husband is an unbaptized publisher.

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:32.770
I learned the truth when some brothers came down here to the islands and began to preach to us.

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:38.770
Jehovah is real to them now, and I often think of this scripture in HG27 that says

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:43.770
these are the desirable things of the nations, the questions, and they are very precious to us.

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:48.770
People would talk about the witnessing in the islands because it was a very touristy area,

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:53.770
so we would have boats going by full of tourists, and part of the tour was,

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:56.770
that's Jehovah's Witnesses preaching in their boat.

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:03.129
That's the little floating king in hall where they need it.

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:08.129
So Jehovah's name has really been made known in the islands and people now know who they are.

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:15.300
Jehovah has certainly blessed the effort of those brothers and sisters.

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:19.300
In seven years of preaching, over 100 studies were started.

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:23.300
27 have become publishers, and 10 were baptized.
