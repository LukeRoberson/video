00:00:01.899 --> 00:00:08.099
Well, this day has finally arrived, and you've made it.

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:13.339
Now, for some of you, it is a return trip home.

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:17.820
For others, you're off to a new home.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:25.019
But no matter where you're going, one thing is for sure, and that is all of you, all

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.420
of you are about to begin a new chapter in your life.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.579
Now, while that realization can spark feelings of excitement, it can also spark a little

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:39.700
anxiety as well.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.100
Questions may be swirling in your mind.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.179
Who really am I now?

00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:51.820
Will I be able to fulfill all that would be expected of me?

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.179
Can I really do this?

00:00:55.179 --> 00:01:02.380
If you find any of these feelings bubbling up inside of you, then remember this.

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.140
You are not alone.

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:11.700
Throughout time, faithful servants of God have had those same feelings.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.260
Let's take a closer look at one of them by turning to the Bible book that bears his

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.849
name, Jeremiah.

00:01:20.849 --> 00:01:28.730
Jeremiah, chapter 1, notice what he says beginning in verse 4.

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:38.209
He said, the word of Jehovah came to me saying, before I formed you in the womb, I knew you.

00:01:38.209 --> 00:01:41.890
And before you were born, I sanctified you.

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:47.730
I made you a prophet to the nations.

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:54.930
And I was Jeremiah flattered by the fact that Jehovah saw such potential in him, quite

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.450
the opposite.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:06.409
Notice his response in verse 6, but I said, alas, O sovereign Lord, Jehovah, I do not know

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:10.889
how to speak for I am just a boy.

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:18.250
In other words, I do not think I am qualified for what you are asking me to do.

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.729
But notice what Jehovah does, verse 9.

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:28.289
Then Jehovah stretched out his hand and touched my mouth.

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:36.090
And Jehovah said to me, I have put my words in your mouth.

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:45.370
Jehovah was reassuring, Jeremiah, don't worry, I have got this and you.

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:52.490
Well the nervous prophet accepted his assignment, and admittedly it was not always easy.

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:59.810
At times he met with fierce opposition, he was mobbed, imprisoned, left to die in the mud

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:05.889
at the bottom of an empty system, clearly he went through a lot.

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:11.860
And at one point he even thought about quitting.

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:20.659
Notice what he says in chapter 20, chapter 20, the middle of verse 8.

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:27.780
He said for me, the word of Jehovah has been the cause of insults and jeering all day long.

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:34.259
So I said, I am not going to make mention of him and I will speak no more in his name.

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:46.050
Like Jeremiah, we too may have our moments when we feel like giving up is the answer.

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:56.969
But let's read on the middle of verse 9, but in my heart, it, the message that he had

00:03:56.969 --> 00:04:02.009
been proclaiming, it became like a burning fire shut up in my bones.

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.009
And I was tired of holding it in.

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:08.449
I could no longer endure it.

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:11.289
Now what happened here?

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:20.329
Despite the hardships, clearly the boy had become the bold prophet of Jehovah.

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:23.930
But my question to you is how did that happen?

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.689
Jeremiah himself tells us at verse 11.

00:04:27.689 --> 00:04:35.689
He says, Jehovah was with me like a fearsome warrior.

00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:43.009
And with the fearsome warrior at his side, Jeremiah went from being unable to speak to being

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:46.769
unable to hold it in.

00:04:46.769 --> 00:04:52.089
He experienced a 180 degree change.

00:04:52.089 --> 00:04:55.009
And he knew exactly who was responsible for it.

00:04:55.089 --> 00:05:02.610
He tells us in our theme scripture text for this talk, same chapter, chapter 20 verse 7.

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:12.089
He says, you, you have fooled me, oh Jehovah, and I, I was fooled.

00:05:12.089 --> 00:05:16.290
You used your strength against me and you prevailed.

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:22.649
Jehovah had fooled Jeremiah in a positive way.

00:05:22.649 --> 00:05:27.050
And Jeremiah reached what he thought was his limit.

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:35.040
Jehovah proved stronger than Jeremiah's weaknesses and empowered him to continue.

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:41.439
He was able to make the 180 because he first of all accepted the assignment.

00:05:41.439 --> 00:05:44.680
Secondly, he trusted in Jehovah.

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:50.879
And third, he allowed time for God's spirit to work on him.

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:58.720
And if you think Jeremiah was an isolated case, think again, Moses did the 180.

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:06.439
He went from a man's slow of speech to becoming a mighty leader of an entire nation.

00:06:06.439 --> 00:06:09.040
Jonah did the 180.

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:16.240
He went from a man running away from his assignment in the opposite direction to becoming a bold

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:19.319
preacher to the Ninevites.

00:06:19.319 --> 00:06:22.000
Peter did the 180.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.959
He went from denying the Christ three times to becoming the rock that Jesus always knew

00:06:27.959 --> 00:06:30.040
he could be.

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.959
So what about you?

00:06:31.959 --> 00:06:37.480
Have you ever been fooled by Jehovah?

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:43.800
I'd like to read to you a few words that I recently received from a Gilead graduate.

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:46.600
She said this.

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:51.399
And we heard the news that we were being assigned to a country that had its fair share

00:06:51.399 --> 00:06:55.079
of poverty, instability, and sickness.

00:06:55.079 --> 00:07:05.160
I felt like saying to Jehovah, are you sure you want to send me there?

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:08.399
I don't like bugs.

00:07:08.399 --> 00:07:11.920
And I'm scared of being sick.

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:16.759
When the date of our departure came, I still remember all the tears I shed when saying

00:07:16.759 --> 00:07:20.560
goodbye to my home and friends.

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:27.199
Well she accepted their assignment, time went by, several years later, she and her husband

00:07:27.199 --> 00:07:31.560
received a new assignment to serve in a different country.

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:34.399
Notice what she says next.

00:07:34.399 --> 00:07:39.399
If I thought leaving the United States was the hardest thing I would ever do, I was

00:07:39.399 --> 00:07:43.439
completely fooled.

00:07:43.439 --> 00:07:52.120
Because the sadness I felt when I had to leave those new friends was indescribable.

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:55.920
I had never cried so much in my life.

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:58.920
She goes on to sum up her experience this way.

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:04.439
She said, Jehovah taught me a lesson in the most loving way.

00:08:04.439 --> 00:08:12.600
Before Gilead, I was putting myself in a box, the what I can do box.

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:20.290
But I wasn't thinking that the person who knows best where I fit is Jehovah.

00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:25.930
Is as if he said, you're not only going to adapt to your new assignment, you're going

00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:30.730
to love it so much you will never want to leave.

00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:32.450
And that's exactly what happened.

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:38.570
I came to truly love the people in our assignment and I can honestly say that these past few

00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:41.490
years have been some of my happiest.

00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:48.330
Now I'm not so afraid of change as before.

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:54.570
I just trust in Jehovah, trusting in the process.

00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:56.730
Amazing, isn't it?

00:08:56.730 --> 00:09:00.450
She too made the 180.

00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:08.090
She had been fooled by Jehovah just like Jeremiah and she came out stronger and happier

00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:10.250
as a result.

00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:12.529
Why did that happen?

00:09:12.529 --> 00:09:17.490
Because when we are fooled by Jehovah, three significant things happen.

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:20.649
First, we draw closer to Him.

00:09:20.649 --> 00:09:26.049
Secondly, we discover new joys that perhaps we never saw coming.

00:09:26.049 --> 00:09:34.330
And third, we open the door to receiving additional training from Jehovah.

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:38.889
In conclusion, just love the people.

00:09:38.889 --> 00:09:41.450
Then they will love you.

00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:45.970
Then you will love your assignment.

00:09:45.970 --> 00:09:52.409
Be willing to walk through the doors wherever they take you.

00:09:52.409 --> 00:09:58.690
If the fearsome warrior by your side, you cannot fail.

00:09:58.690 --> 00:10:03.570
Always welcome the chance to be fooled by Jehovah.

00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:09.289
Because it means that you are about to experience something pretty magnificent and guess what?

00:10:09.289 --> 00:10:11.730
It has been tailor-made just for you.
