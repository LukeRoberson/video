00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.059
we must know Jehovah well.

00:00:06.059 --> 00:00:09.060
That means knowing his thinking on matters.

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:12.060
We should welcome such an examination

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:15.060
and make any necessary changes.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:21.059
For example, let's read 1 Corinthians 15 and verse 33 together.

00:00:21.059 --> 00:00:24.750
Here we read,

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.750
Do not be misled.

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.750
Bad associations spoil useful habits.

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.750
As familiar as that principle is,

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.750
can you think of an area in your life

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:41.340
where it's difficult to apply?

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.340
Hey, John.

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:43.340
I know it's not unusual,

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.340
but there's no one entertained those clients tonight.

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:46.340
So can you do it?

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:47.340
Thanks.

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:54.630
Till then, it wasn't my usual thing.

00:00:54.630 --> 00:01:07.810
But I need to support my family.

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:20.280
And these aren't really my friends.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.560
I can handle it, I think.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.560
We're faced with bad associations in subtle ways.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.560
This may require us to ask additional questions of ourselves.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.560
Are we letting in bad association through social media?

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.560
Perhaps we can think of another way of bad association.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:46.379
I don't think so.

00:01:46.379 --> 00:01:50.379
Except for some friends for my old congregation.

00:01:50.379 --> 00:01:51.379
Wow.

00:01:51.379 --> 00:01:54.379
They're not doing so well spiritually.

00:01:54.379 --> 00:01:59.379
But if I stay connected and see what they're doing,

00:01:59.379 --> 00:02:01.379
maybe I can help them.

00:02:01.379 --> 00:02:03.379
This can affect us.

00:02:03.379 --> 00:02:07.379
Maybe it's something very specific.

00:02:07.379 --> 00:02:18.050
Or maybe bad association is coming from a place we never expected.

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.710
I only join games with witness friends, I know.

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:28.710
But sometimes they connect with people I don't know.

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.710
Who pick games?

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:36.750
I'm not sure we should play.

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.699
But maybe my friends know them.

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:43.699
So they're probably okay.

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:47.699
Vital that we avoid bad associations.

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:51.699
Now as we resume in Psalm 26.

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:58.189
I thought that talk didn't apply to me.

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:02.189
But can I really handle bad association?

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:05.189
If I take a stand, I may lose my job.

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:15.900
But that's being anxious about tomorrow.

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.900
Jesus said, so never be anxious.

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.900
And say, what are we to eat?

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:21.900
Or what are we to drink?

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.900
Or what are we to wear?

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.900
Jehovah knows I need a job.

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:35.900
And I need to set a good example for when my children face bad association.

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:44.319
1 Corinthians 1533.

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:47.319
My friends' posts are getting worse.

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:52.319
They're pictures and comments.

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:57.139
2 Timothy 216.

00:03:57.139 --> 00:04:02.139
But reject empty speeches that violate what is holy.

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:07.139
For they will lead to more and more ungodliness.

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:12.900
I'm letting them share empty speeches with me online.

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.900
I will try to help them while I still can.

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.899
But following their posts is not the way to do it.

00:04:18.899 --> 00:04:27.160
I told Mom what's been happening when I came with my friends.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.160
She gave me good ideas on what to look for in the research guide.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.889
Christian life.

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:38.490
Association.

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:43.149
Is your recreation beneficial?

00:04:43.149 --> 00:04:45.149
Who are my companions?

00:04:45.149 --> 00:04:51.750
It says, who are the ones I want to share my leisure time with?

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:56.750
Does he have the same Bible-based values and morals that I have?

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:58.750
Good question.

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:01.750
I don't even know who they are sometimes.

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:05.750
Psalm 11963 says,

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:10.750
I am a friend of all who fear you and of those who keep your orders.

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:16.259
But if I only know them online,

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:21.459
I can't know if they feared Jehovah.

00:05:21.459 --> 00:05:25.459
Let's turn in our Bibles to the book of 1 Timothy chapter 1.

00:05:25.459 --> 00:05:28.459
Verse number 5.

00:05:28.459 --> 00:05:32.160
And notice how it reads.

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:37.160
Really, the objective of this instruction is love out of a clean heart

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:43.160
and out of a good conscience and out of faith without hypocrisy.

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:51.160
We train our conscience with Bible principles that reveal Jehovah's thinking.

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:56.600
There may be several principles needed for our unique problem.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.600
But when we find and apply them,

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:04.600
we'll enjoy a clean heart, man, a good conscience.
