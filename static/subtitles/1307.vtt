00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:10.939
In 2013, our English-hunted Bibles were revised, and shortly thereafter, the Braille Bibles

00:00:10.939 --> 00:00:14.779
were approved to be revised when English and Portuguese.

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:17.059
We knew it was going to be a large job.

00:00:17.059 --> 00:00:22.739
We were having problems with the pages either tearing or coming completely out of the Bible.

00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:27.899
We tried changing the paper to see if that would be a simple solution, and we had a brother

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:30.420
who is blind come in and help us.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.219
We would be able to test the paper in the machine and actually walk it right over to the

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:40.020
brother, and he gave us immediate feedback on adjustments to the machine, or if it wasn't

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.899
working at all.

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:49.619
During our testing, we tried about 25 different types of paper, but we ended up coming back

00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:54.219
to the idea that the binding was the best way to find a durable solution.

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:59.820
The result is that the durability is 400% stronger than it was before.

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.260
We can pick up an entire book by holding just one page.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.099
In the Literature Production Office, we have ones who receive the requests for the Braille

00:01:09.099 --> 00:01:10.099
Bibles.

00:01:10.099 --> 00:01:14.939
We have ones who review these requests as they come into the system, and then we have

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.219
a separate set of brothers who make sure that all the materials are here on time.

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:24.219
We get our orders from the office, and then the office will then tell us how many to make,

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:26.780
maybe the specific volume number.

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.579
Braille Bibles come from the Wal-Kill Prennery on the Braille production floor.

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:34.340
Right at the end of the machine, we have a Braille paper roll.

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.060
We make sure that there's nothing wrong with that roll, and then it gets fed into the machine.

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.459
It creates braille on both sides of the page, and after that it gets cut and punched.

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:49.420
We gather it, do some quality inspection, we'll bind it together, we'll rivet each section

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.340
into a binder that has been pre-labeled with the volume number, do an inspection on it,

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.859
pop it in a box, and then send it out the door.

00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:01.939
To produce the English Bible and Braille, it takes about four and a half hours, which

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:07.219
then breaks out into 28 volumes, and the Portuguese Bible and Braille takes closer to five and

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:11.539
a half hours, and that breaks out into 32 volumes.

00:02:11.539 --> 00:02:15.460
We did not start production with Genesis because we wanted the brothers and sisters to

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.139
be able to receive the volume that would be on the congregation Bible reading schedule

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:20.979
at our midweek meetings.

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:26.939
So as we receive the files for each volume, it's being printed and sent out to our brothers

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:29.219
and sisters.

00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:34.500
It's important to me to be able to read God's Word rather than just listening because

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:40.180
I am a visual person, so the eyesight is gone, but I'm still visual.

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.500
I learn better from reading than I do from listening.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.860
In my mind, when I'm listening, my mind wonders, but when I'm reading, I can stop and meditate

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.500
on what I'm studying that helps me with my relationship with Jehovah.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.139
It has helped me a lot because a lot of things I don't have to look up because it's in plain

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:00.139
English.

00:03:00.139 --> 00:03:05.780
They have so many things in this new Bible that I can use, like the outline.

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.060
I can get that outline and find something fast.

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.539
It has the appendix, it has the word index, the glossary.

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:18.300
During the time of the memorial, I was able to read the events of the last week of Jesus

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:19.780
life.

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:30.419
I really enjoy reading with one hand and pulling the other hand down and reading the fun notes.

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:37.419
I can participate more in the midweek meeting, for instance, in the section digging for spiritual

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:38.419
gyms.

00:03:38.419 --> 00:03:42.979
The brothers always get someone from the audience to read the scriptures.

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:48.300
So once I got the new Bible, I could raise my hand and go out and to read.

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.539
And so the whole meeting opened up.

00:03:51.539 --> 00:04:04.020
The revised edition helps me be more effective as a me and helps me to find exactly what I need.

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:07.699
Before the revision, when he'd have a part on the meeting, he would have to get his

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:12.620
brailler out and have me dictate one sentence at a time so he could type it all out what

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.300
he was going to use in his part.

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:19.939
So this is nice because he has the right wording that all the friends have.

00:04:19.939 --> 00:04:22.180
I like to carry it from house to house.

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:27.939
So I can only take the one volume because they're huge, but whatever the initial call is,

00:04:27.939 --> 00:04:33.819
I can take that scripture and see if the householder will let me read a scripture for them.

00:04:33.819 --> 00:04:38.579
It means so much to be able to read the scriptures, to do the personal study.

00:04:38.579 --> 00:04:43.259
I am very thankful for all the work our brothers have done up in Wal-Kill.

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:51.259
I really appreciate the effort that they've all gone through because that's a lot of work.

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:55.459
Then Jehovah's organization, they care for everyone.

00:04:55.459 --> 00:04:59.860
I was so thankful that they had the Braille Bible for the blind.

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.899
That's what draws me closer to Jehovah.

00:05:02.899 --> 00:05:06.740
Being able to study his word and look the scriptures up.

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:09.699
The new Bible is personal to me.

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:13.779
I feel like it was a personal answer to your prayer, Jehovah.

00:05:13.779 --> 00:05:16.980
Supplied it because that's the main thing I wanted to read.

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:20.860
And I am so thankful to Jehovah.
