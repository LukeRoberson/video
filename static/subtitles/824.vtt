00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:09.189
We live in a time that will end in final judgment by means of God's kingdom.

00:00:09.189 --> 00:00:16.289
Jesus described this time when He gave His disciples a prophetic sign regarding His invisible presence

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.589
at the conclusion of the system of things.

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:27.489
Since His prophecy applies to our day, we should be very interested in its details.

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:33.189
It also points to a bright future for those who heed its warnings.

00:00:33.189 --> 00:00:42.890
We find the prophecy in Matthew chapter 24 and 25, Mark chapter 13 and Luke chapter 21.

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.289
After revealing many of the things that would occur,

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.890
Jesus provided warnings for His disciples by means of three parables.

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.590
First, He gave the parable of the virgins.

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:05.290
Then, the parable of the talents, and finally, the parable of the sheep and the goats.

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:12.489
The parable will show how a person's behavior will affect his or her final judgment.

00:01:12.489 --> 00:01:17.790
The two parables apply to those, the first two, to those with a heavenly hope,

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.989
and the third parable applies to those with an earthly hope.

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:30.989
Yet, no matter what our hope may be, all of us can learn from the warnings found in Jesus parables.

00:01:30.989 --> 00:01:34.790
Let's start with the third parable.

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.989
In the parable of the sheep and goats,

00:01:37.989 --> 00:01:45.390
Jesus described the final judgment for sheep-like ones and goat-like ones during the Great Tribulation.

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.090
As Jehovah's appointed Judging King,

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.290
Jesus will be completely righteous in the judgment that He gives.

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:55.590
As a thorough judge,

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.489
He is already observing the actions, attitudes, and speech of all people,

00:02:01.489 --> 00:02:06.689
including how they treat His anointed brothers.

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.090
By the start of the Great Tribulation,

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:16.189
Jesus will have identified those who are sheep-like or goat-like in their conduct and attitude.

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:21.490
From that time onward, those who are goat-like will not seek to change.

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:27.289
However, those who are sheep-like and who have the hope of living forever on earth

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:35.289
will need to remain faithful in order for Jehovah to keep their names in the book of life.

00:02:35.389 --> 00:02:37.889
Then, just before Armageddon,

00:02:37.889 --> 00:02:43.689
God's Son will pass final judgment on all those then living here on earth.

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:49.889
Persons who are judged to be righteous will enter into everlasting life on earth

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:55.490
with a marvelous reward for those who keep their integrity.

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:59.990
Although Jesus' third parable applies to those who hope to live on the earth,

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:05.389
anointed ones too must listen to the warning message found in that parable.

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:07.389
How so?

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:13.389
Because Jesus is observing their actions, attitudes, and speech as well,

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:17.990
they too must prove to be righteous and faithful.

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:21.590
Still, a few questions remain.

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.990
For example, how are anointed Christians undergoing a period of judgment today?

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:30.889
And what warnings did Jesus provide for them?

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:38.990
We find the answers to both questions in the first two parables of Matthew chapter 25.

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:41.289
To prepare us for this review,

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:46.090
let's briefly consider how anointed Christians are chosen.

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:51.289
We'll start by looking at a lesson from ancient times.

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:54.789
When the priesthood was established in ancient Israel,

00:03:54.889 --> 00:03:58.490
Jehovah decided who would serve as high priest,

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:02.090
as well as the underpriests at the tabernacle.

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:08.389
Exodus 281 tells us that he selected Aaron along with his sons.

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:12.490
No one could rightly question Jehovah's choice

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:17.189
and those chosen had to prove worthy of their calling.

00:04:17.189 --> 00:04:19.790
Similar to what he did back then,

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:24.290
Jehovah chooses those who will serve as priest in heaven.

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:29.790
He began by selecting Jesus to serve as high priest.

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:32.790
Although Jesus was a perfect man,

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:36.290
he did not choose that role for himself.

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:39.689
We read at Hebrews 5 and verse 5,

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:46.189
that the Christ did not glorify himself by becoming a high priest.

00:04:46.189 --> 00:04:50.389
Likewise, those who will serve as priest in heaven

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:54.089
do not choose themselves for this assignment.

00:04:54.089 --> 00:04:59.490
They are selected by Jehovah and anointed with his Holy Spirit.

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:04.089
He knows each one whom he has anointed for this service.

00:05:04.089 --> 00:05:09.689
How do faithful anointed ones view their heavenly calling?

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:12.889
When a person is anointed by God,

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:16.990
he or she knows without doubt that it is from Jehovah

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:21.990
and that one accepts Jehovah's choice with gratitude.

00:05:22.089 --> 00:05:24.689
Instead of feeling proud or haughty,

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:30.389
anointed ones strive to imitate Jesus' example of humility.

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:33.889
They are helped to do so by keeping in mind

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:39.889
the lessons and warnings that are found in Jesus' parables for them.

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:44.990
It is not worthy that just before relating his parables,

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:48.689
Jesus spoke about a faithful and discreet slave

00:05:48.689 --> 00:05:51.589
who would distribute spiritual food at the proper time

00:05:51.589 --> 00:05:54.290
during the last days.

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:58.790
That slave pictures a small group of anointed Christian men

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:01.790
today, the governing body.

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:03.189
For their faithful service,

00:06:03.189 --> 00:06:05.790
Jesus said that there would be a reward,

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:09.589
but he also provided a warning.

00:06:09.589 --> 00:06:11.189
He spoke about what would happen

00:06:11.189 --> 00:06:15.189
if that slave ever lost sight of Jesus' future return

00:06:15.189 --> 00:06:18.290
and started to mistreat his fellow slaves.

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:20.889
If that were to happen,

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:24.189
that slave would be viewed as evil

00:06:24.189 --> 00:06:27.490
and would as Matthew 2451 states

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:31.790
be punished with the greatest severity.

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:35.990
Please note that Jesus was not prophesying

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:38.990
that there would be an evil slave.

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:42.689
This is a warning, not a prophecy.

00:06:43.689 --> 00:06:46.889
What was the warning that the faithful slave

00:06:46.889 --> 00:06:48.790
needs to remain watchful?

00:06:49.689 --> 00:06:52.389
Yet it is not just the faithful and discreet slave

00:06:52.389 --> 00:06:54.990
who must remain watchful.

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:56.490
By means of his parables,

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:59.490
Jesus warned that all anointed ones

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:02.889
must likewise prove to be discreet,

00:07:02.889 --> 00:07:05.790
faithful, and watchful.

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:08.689
Now, how did Jesus make his point?

00:07:09.689 --> 00:07:11.990
In the parable of the virgins,

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:14.189
Jesus spoke of ten virgins

00:07:14.189 --> 00:07:16.790
who went out to meet a bridegroom.

00:07:16.889 --> 00:07:18.689
They hoped to accompany the bridegroom

00:07:18.689 --> 00:07:20.689
into his marriage feast.

00:07:20.689 --> 00:07:24.689
Jesus described five of the virgins as discreet

00:07:24.689 --> 00:07:26.990
and five as foolish.

00:07:28.089 --> 00:07:30.689
The Greek word used for discreet

00:07:30.689 --> 00:07:33.490
conveys the idea of understanding,

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:35.990
forethought, discernment,

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:38.589
and wisdom in a practical sense.

00:07:39.689 --> 00:07:43.290
So, the discreet virgins were wise

00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:45.290
and they showed this by being ready

00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:49.189
when the bridegroom arrived in the middle of the night.

00:07:49.189 --> 00:07:51.689
They had lamps to light their way

00:07:51.689 --> 00:07:54.990
and Matthew 25 verse 4 adds

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:57.389
that the discreet virgins took oil

00:07:57.389 --> 00:08:01.089
in their flasks along with their lamps.

00:08:01.089 --> 00:08:04.689
So, they had the means to keep their lamps burning.

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:08.490
Because they proved to be ready,

00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:10.089
they could follow the bridegroom

00:08:10.089 --> 00:08:12.589
into his marriage feast.

00:08:12.689 --> 00:08:15.889
This action depicts genuine anointed ones

00:08:15.889 --> 00:08:18.990
entering into their heavenly reward.

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:20.589
They will be judged as worthy

00:08:20.589 --> 00:08:25.389
to join the bridegroom Jesus in his heavenly kingdom.

00:08:25.389 --> 00:08:28.889
But what about the foolish virgins?

00:08:28.889 --> 00:08:31.389
Well, unlike the discreet virgins,

00:08:31.389 --> 00:08:32.990
the foolish ones were not ready

00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:35.090
when the bridegroom arrived.

00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:36.990
Their lamps died out.

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:37.789
As a result,

00:08:37.789 --> 00:08:39.789
they could not follow the bridegroom

00:08:39.789 --> 00:08:43.090
and enter into his marriage feast.

00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:45.690
When they later tried to do so,

00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:48.889
they heard the bridegroom tell them,

00:08:48.889 --> 00:08:50.190
I do not know you.

00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:54.190
What is the lesson and warning

00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:56.190
that Jesus was illustrating?

00:08:57.289 --> 00:08:59.690
He was showing that only anointed Christians

00:08:59.690 --> 00:09:02.389
who keep on the watch and prove to be ready

00:09:02.389 --> 00:09:04.690
will follow him into the reward.

00:09:05.889 --> 00:09:07.090
Notice though,

00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:08.389
that Jesus did not say

00:09:08.389 --> 00:09:10.990
that there would be a large number of foolish ones

00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:12.289
who would be unprepared

00:09:12.289 --> 00:09:14.190
when he comes in this way

00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:16.490
at the great tribulation.

00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:17.690
Here too,

00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:19.389
this is a warning,

00:09:19.389 --> 00:09:20.590
not a prophecy.

00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:23.789
We're not focused on five of them being discreet

00:09:23.789 --> 00:09:25.889
and five of them being foolish.

00:09:26.889 --> 00:09:29.289
Jesus was simply letting anointed ones know

00:09:29.289 --> 00:09:30.490
what would happen

00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:33.389
if they failed to keep on the watch.

00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:37.190
That is a sobering thought.

00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:40.990
Whether our hope is heavenly or earthly,

00:09:40.990 --> 00:09:43.590
all true Christians should listen

00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:47.789
to the warning found in the parable of the virgins.

00:09:47.789 --> 00:09:49.789
We must keep on the watch

00:09:49.789 --> 00:09:51.990
and always be ready

00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:54.690
to carry out our service to God.

00:09:56.289 --> 00:09:58.789
Now after using the parable of the virgins

00:09:58.789 --> 00:10:00.990
to emphasize the need to be discreet,

00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:03.789
Jesus related a parable

00:10:03.789 --> 00:10:06.590
that highlights the need to be faithful.

00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:10.190
It is the parable of the talents or money.

00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:12.590
In this parable,

00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:14.690
Jesus tells about two slaves

00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:16.990
who were faithful to their master

00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:18.789
and one slave who was not.

00:10:19.789 --> 00:10:23.389
How did the two slaves prove to be faithful?

00:10:23.389 --> 00:10:24.990
Well, the faithful slaves worked hard

00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:26.190
to increase the money

00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:28.789
that their master entrusted to their care

00:10:28.789 --> 00:10:30.990
just before he traveled abroad.

00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:33.690
When he returned,

00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:36.389
the faithful slaves had more to give back

00:10:36.389 --> 00:10:38.190
than what they had received

00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:41.190
and they were blessed for doing so.

00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:44.190
But what about the third slave, the sluggish one?

00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:47.490
What did he do with what he had received?

00:10:48.490 --> 00:10:51.389
While the sluggish slave buried what he had been given

00:10:51.389 --> 00:10:54.889
and failed to increase his master's talents,

00:10:54.889 --> 00:10:56.190
when the master returned,

00:10:56.190 --> 00:10:59.990
that slave had nothing additional to give to his master.

00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:02.090
He even tried to blame the master

00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:04.289
calling him a demanding man.

00:11:05.289 --> 00:11:06.590
As a result,

00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:09.889
that slave did not receive greater blessings.

00:11:09.889 --> 00:11:12.289
More than that,

00:11:12.289 --> 00:11:15.789
what he had been given was taken away from him

00:11:15.789 --> 00:11:18.889
and he was cast out of the master's household.

00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:22.590
What did the master's response mean

00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:24.789
for each of his slaves

00:11:24.789 --> 00:11:26.889
and whom do they picture today?

00:11:28.690 --> 00:11:30.190
The two faithful slaves

00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:31.990
depict anointed Christians

00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:36.289
who prove to be valued members of the master's household.

00:11:36.289 --> 00:11:38.889
The master, Jesus,

00:11:38.889 --> 00:11:42.990
invites them to enter into the joy of their master.

00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:47.090
That joy pictures their heavenly reward.

00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:48.590
On the other hand,

00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:51.190
the bad example of the sluggish slave

00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:54.190
provides a warning for anointed ones.

00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:55.090
How so?

00:11:56.590 --> 00:12:00.490
If anointed ones do not remain alert and watchful,

00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:04.490
they could become self-satisfied with what they have received.

00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:08.690
They might not extend themselves in kingdom service.

00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:11.490
They could lose sight of their responsibilities

00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:15.690
and fail to do a second Peter 1 verse 10 urges

00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:17.889
where they are told to make the calling

00:12:17.889 --> 00:12:20.889
and choosing sure for themselves.

00:12:21.889 --> 00:12:24.889
If any of them become like the sluggish slave,

00:12:24.889 --> 00:12:28.289
they would not be approved to enter into the heavenly kingdom

00:12:28.289 --> 00:12:32.090
and share in the joy of the master.

00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:33.789
Once again,

00:12:33.789 --> 00:12:36.490
Jesus was providing a warning,

00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:38.090
not a prophecy.

00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:40.490
Clearly, all anointed Christians

00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:44.889
must strive to be both discreet and faithful.

00:12:46.389 --> 00:12:49.490
Whether our hope is heavenly or earthly,

00:12:49.490 --> 00:12:51.889
all true Christians are determined

00:12:51.889 --> 00:12:54.490
to remain faithful to Jehovah.

00:12:54.490 --> 00:12:57.490
We are secure in our relationship with him.

00:12:58.490 --> 00:13:00.789
We're not concerned if Jehovah chooses

00:13:00.789 --> 00:13:04.690
to anoint some faithful ones in more recent years.

00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:09.490
We recall what Jesus said regarding the 11th hour workers

00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:11.990
in his illustration about the vineyard.

00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:16.389
You can read about it in Matthew chapter 20.

00:13:16.389 --> 00:13:20.590
Those who were invited to work in the vineyard later in the day

00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:23.789
received the same reward from the master of the vineyard

00:13:23.789 --> 00:13:28.090
as those who were invited to work in it earlier in the day.

00:13:28.190 --> 00:13:30.490
Likewise, Jehovah and his son know

00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:32.889
how many anointed ones to call

00:13:32.889 --> 00:13:36.789
in order to complete the number of 144,000

00:13:36.789 --> 00:13:39.690
before the end comes.

00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:42.190
But no matter when they are selected,

00:13:42.190 --> 00:13:45.490
each anointed one who is judged to be faithful

00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:48.789
will receive the heavenly reward.

00:13:48.789 --> 00:13:49.789
Now with that in mind,

00:13:49.789 --> 00:13:52.889
let's consider Matthew chapter 24

00:13:52.889 --> 00:13:55.389
and verses 40 and 41.

00:13:56.389 --> 00:13:58.889
And as we do, we'll see how these verses

00:13:58.889 --> 00:14:02.590
connect to Jesus' parables for the anointed.

00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:07.090
Matthew 24 verse 40, it reads.

00:14:07.090 --> 00:14:09.490
Then two men will be in the field.

00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:13.490
One will be taken along and the other abandoned.

00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:16.389
Two women will be grinding at the hand mill.

00:14:16.389 --> 00:14:22.860
One will be taken along and the other abandoned.

00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:26.659
Did you notice some similarities to the parables?

00:14:26.759 --> 00:14:29.659
Jesus spoke of two men working in a field

00:14:29.659 --> 00:14:33.059
and of two women working at a hand mill.

00:14:33.059 --> 00:14:37.059
Outwardly, they appear to be the same.

00:14:37.059 --> 00:14:41.960
But in each case, Jesus said that one would be taken along

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:43.860
and the other abandoned.

00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:48.360
He then urged his followers to keep on the watch therefore

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:52.360
because you do not know on what day your Lord is coming.

00:14:53.259 --> 00:14:55.960
Jesus said something very similar

00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:59.259
after relating the parable of the virgins.

00:14:59.259 --> 00:15:03.759
In both examples, he provided a warning.

00:15:03.759 --> 00:15:05.559
Since the parable of the virgins

00:15:05.559 --> 00:15:08.259
applies to anointed Christians,

00:15:08.259 --> 00:15:10.059
do Jesus' comments about those

00:15:10.059 --> 00:15:13.460
who are taken along also apply to the anointed?

00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:15.059
It appears that they do.

00:15:15.059 --> 00:15:20.259
And here again, Jesus was providing a warning.

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:22.759
In his great prophecy regarding the conclusion

00:15:22.759 --> 00:15:24.659
of the system of things,

00:15:24.659 --> 00:15:27.860
we find that Jesus lovingly highlights

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:30.659
both the good news of the kingdom

00:15:30.659 --> 00:15:33.559
as well as warning messages for all people,

00:15:33.559 --> 00:15:35.960
including his followers.

00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:40.659
Down to this day, our message follows the same pattern.

00:15:40.659 --> 00:15:45.259
It is both one of salvation, as well as one of warning.

00:15:45.259 --> 00:15:47.759
And we must continue to do all that we can

00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:50.659
to deliver Jesus' twofold message

00:15:50.659 --> 00:15:54.659
and help others to act on it while there is still time.

00:15:54.659 --> 00:15:59.659
Clearly, Jehovah and his son want us to remain discreet,

00:15:59.659 --> 00:16:03.759
faithful and on the watch.

00:16:03.759 --> 00:16:06.360
So what have we considered?

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:08.960
Some of the virgins in Jesus' illustration

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:11.259
found out that the door was shut

00:16:11.259 --> 00:16:13.360
and they heard the bridegroom tell them,

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:15.759
I do not know you.

00:16:15.759 --> 00:16:18.860
One of the slaves in Jesus' illustration of the talents

00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:21.360
did not enter into his master's joy

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:25.059
but was thrown outside into the darkness.

00:16:25.059 --> 00:16:29.860
Jesus also indicated that not all would be taken along

00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:31.960
into the heavenly reward.

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:35.860
What a serious warning for those who have the heavenly hope.

00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:40.659
Even so, we are confident that the full number of them

00:16:40.659 --> 00:16:42.860
will be filled.

00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:45.460
Truly, this is a time of judgment

00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:47.360
for all of God's people,

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:48.860
including the righteous sheep

00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:52.059
who yearn to live forever on earth.

00:16:52.059 --> 00:16:55.059
But there is no reason for any of us to fear

00:16:55.059 --> 00:16:58.559
the final judgment that is yet ahead.

00:16:58.559 --> 00:17:02.059
Our loving Heavenly Father promises to give us power

00:17:02.059 --> 00:17:04.460
beyond what is normal

00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:09.160
so that we may, as Luke 21 verse 36 says,

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:13.759
succeed in standing before the Son of Man.

00:17:13.759 --> 00:17:18.759
So then, whether our hope is heavenly or earthly,

00:17:18.759 --> 00:17:22.960
we must heed the warnings found in Jesus' parables

00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:27.460
and thereby keep our names written in the book of life.
