00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:07.889
First, let's talk about apostasy, and we'll call it spiritual poison.

00:00:07.889 --> 00:00:10.650
Now, think about poison.

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.089
What's the best way to avoid being poisoned?

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:18.890
Well, we have to recognize poison when we see it, and then avoid it.

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:24.089
And the same principle applies to teachings that could destroy our faith.

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:27.250
And that's not always easy.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.969
Now, not many of our brothers and sisters would deliberately get involved with apostates,

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:34.450
but it could happen without our realizing it.

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:39.810
Now, we receive letters at times from brothers and sisters who were troubled by something

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:47.210
they saw on a web page, an accusation, a rumour about the society or about the organization,

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:52.649
and the problem is they had no idea that apostates were behind it.

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.210
It's tricky, because the apostates don't advertise you are now on an apostate web

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.210
page.

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:05.250
They often pose as sincere witnesses who just have questions or concerns.

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.010
And some who aren't really apostates can cause just as much trouble as the apostates do

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.769
by their negative talk and criticism.

00:01:12.769 --> 00:01:16.290
Brothers, we need to be on the alert.

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.129
This is serious.

00:01:19.129 --> 00:01:24.329
Suppose that out of curiosity, you get into a discussion forum with individuals who claim

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:25.730
to meet your home as witnesses.

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:26.730
Now, maybe they are.

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:27.730
Maybe they aren't.

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:28.730
You don't know.

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:29.730
You've never met them.

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.090
And someone starts asking questions.

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.810
What did you think of last month's broadcast?

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.530
Did you really find it encouraging?

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.849
Or do you think the brothers who write watched our articles are living in the real world?

00:01:41.849 --> 00:01:45.810
I wonder if they realize just how hard it is out here.

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.250
And then a few others join in with their own negative comments.

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.689
Now you don't know whether these individuals are apostates or just brothers and sisters

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.409
who are in serious spiritual trouble.

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:59.170
But does it matter?

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.409
How does it make you feel?

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:07.730
When you leave the forum, do you feel up-built, determined to expand your ministry?

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:11.729
More convinced than ever that Jehovah has an organization that you love and that you're

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:16.810
delighted to be a part of you feel honored to be a part of that organization?

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.889
Or does the experience leave you sad?

00:02:20.889 --> 00:02:25.150
Un-easy, uncomfortable.

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.909
Now someone might say, I need to get involved in that forum so I can help those people.

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:33.430
They shouldn't be together.

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.669
Even if they are apostates, they're not good for one another.

00:02:37.669 --> 00:02:42.750
Staying in that forum to help someone is like holding his hand while he drinks poison

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.310
and then having some yourself so he doesn't have to drink alone.

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.229
We need to follow the advice recorded at Romans chapter 16 and verse 17.

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:59.789
Now think of this imaginary forum that we just described in the light of Romans chapter 16 and

00:02:59.789 --> 00:03:00.789
verse 17.

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:05.990
I remember there's all kinds of negative top flying around in this forum.

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:07.830
You don't know who's behind it.

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.629
And here's what it says in Romans 16 verse 17.

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:21.990
Now I urge you brothers to keep your eye on those who create divisions and causes

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:29.870
for stumbling contrary to the teaching that you have learned and avoid them.

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.789
Now think about that forum.

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:35.430
Does it create divisions?

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.270
Yes.

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:39.150
Is it a cause for stumbling?

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:40.750
Could be.

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.550
Is it contrary to what we have learned?

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:46.229
Do we even have to answer that question?

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:51.069
Now whether it's intended or not, the effect will be to weaken our faith.

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:52.069
So what do we do?

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:54.750
What does Paul tell us to do here at the end of verse 17?

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.789
He says, avoid them.

00:03:56.789 --> 00:04:05.620
No, I'd like to say a kind word to some who may be involved in discussion forums.

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.539
You may like to use this medium to blow off steam, so to speak.

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:14.139
Maybe there are little things in the congregation that are happening that you wonder about or

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:20.019
decisions the elders have made that you wonder about and so you get involved in the forum

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:23.819
and you blow off steam and after that you feel better.

00:04:23.819 --> 00:04:26.100
But what about others in the forum?

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.379
How do they feel?

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:32.899
Wouldn't you feel awful if negative comments you made were responsible for someone leaving

00:04:32.899 --> 00:04:34.699
the truth?

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:37.060
I know you wouldn't want that to happen.

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:42.939
So please, please be careful about what you say.

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:47.060
Now another person might say, well I can see where those warnings about apostates applied

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:51.500
to so-and-so, he's weak, but don't worry about me, I'm spiritually strong, I can handle

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.699
it.

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:57.500
That's like a weightlifter, thinking that he can drink a vile of poison and it won't

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.740
hurt him because he's so big and strong.

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:07.500
We are not so strong, so spiritual, so intelligent, that we can't be affected by the poison of

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:08.980
apostate ideas.
