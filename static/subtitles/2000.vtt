00:00:01.899 --> 00:00:05.900
an introduction to the book of Matthew.

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.900
Matthew was working as a tax collector and cavernium

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.900
when he was invited by Jesus to become a disciple.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.900
Later, after the Passover of 31 CE,

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.899
he was also chosen as one of the twelve apostles.

00:00:19.899 --> 00:00:24.899
Matthew personally witnessed most of Jesus' three-and-a-half-year ministry.

00:00:24.899 --> 00:00:27.899
And around the year of 41 CE,

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:31.899
he was the first to write an account of Jesus' life and teachings.

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:35.899
His account would eventually become one of the four Bible books,

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:39.899
along with Mark, Luke, and John, known as the Gospels.

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:46.899
The book of Matthew focuses on the time period between 2 BCE and 33 CE.

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:49.899
It includes events just before Jesus' birth

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:54.899
and ends with Jesus' command to go make disciples.

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.899
Did you know? Although Matthew is the first book of the Christian Greek scriptures,

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:03.899
there is evidence that it was originally written in Hebrew.

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.900
Some time later, Matthew himself may have translated his gospel into Greek.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.900
The book has been divided into 28 chapters.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.900
In the first 18 chapters,

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.900
much of the content is arranged by subject,

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.900
focusing on the teachings found in Jesus' public discourses.

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.900
Starting in chapter 19, however,

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.900
Matthew turns his attention to the last days of Jesus' ministry

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.900
and generally relates the events in the order that they happened.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.900
About 40% of Matthew's gospel is unique,

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.900
describing events and details not found in the other three gospels.

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.900
It begins with Abraham,

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.900
and lists the family line of Jesus through his adoptive father Joseph,

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.900
proving that Jesus is the legal heir of King David.

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.900
It provides a thorough account of Jesus' sermon on the mount,

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.900
and it also includes many of Jesus' illustrations,

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.900
such as the wheat and the weeds,

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.900
the pearl of high value, and the dragnet.

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.900
Matthew's account greatly emphasizes

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.900
that the theme of Jesus' teaching was the Kingdom of the heavens.

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:14.900
To help readers identify Jesus as the promised Messiah,

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.900
this book includes numerous direct quotes and references

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.900
from many books in the Hebrew Scriptures.

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.900
No wonder Matthew has been described as a bridge

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.900
between the Hebrew and Christian Greek Scriptures.

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.900
As you enjoy your study of Matthew,

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.900
note how the gospel establishes Jesus' legal right to David's throne,

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.900
emphasize his Christ teachings, and highlights God's Kingdom.
