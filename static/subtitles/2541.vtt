00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:06.040
Have you ever stopped at the end of the day and ask yourself that question?

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:08.580
Who is it that touched me today?

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.500
Not in a physical sense

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:14.259
but in a way that really

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.660
truly matters.

00:00:17.059 --> 00:00:19.059
Who left an impression on me?

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.500
Who reminded me of something that I had forgotten?

00:00:23.219 --> 00:00:28.300
Something about kindness, something about faith, something about love?

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.299
It's easy to go throughout our daily interactions with people

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:37.299
and forget about just that, the people.

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:44.299
A conversation in the hallway and email exchange, a casual remark from a coworker,

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:48.299
all of these moments can go unnoticed.

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:54.299
And yet, each one holds potential, each one holds promise.

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:59.299
The challenge isn't whether we're going to encounter people because that's going to happen.

00:00:59.299 --> 00:01:03.299
In Jehovah's organization, it's all about the people.

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:09.299
But it's whether you're going to let the people touch you in a way that makes a difference.

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:14.299
Jesus understood the value of human connection

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:19.299
as busy as he was with the weight of the world on his shoulders.

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:23.299
Jesus always took time for people.

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.299
He took time for the leper as well as the rich young ruler.

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:36.299
Jesus took time for the old and the young, the rich and the poor, the Jew and the Greek.

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:42.299
Jesus sought to see others as his Heavenly Father saw them.

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.299
And he took time to try to understand people.

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:49.299
What makes them tick?

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:53.299
Jesus genuinely wanted to see people.

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:55.299
He wanted to see people.

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:58.299
He wanted to see their struggles.

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:01.299
He wanted to experience their faith.

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:06.299
He wanted to understand their untold stories.

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.300
Let's take one account that highlights this.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.300
It's recorded in the book of Mark chapter 5.

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.300
This is another day for Jesus, filled with people.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.300
Jesus and his disciples had just returned from the decapolis.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.300
They'd landed on the northwestern shore of the sea of Galilee.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:30.300
There were more people when he got to the shore waiting for him.

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:35.300
And among the people was a synagogue ruler whose name was Jairus.

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:40.300
He was desperate to see Jesus because his daughter was sick.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.740
And he wanted Jesus to come and help his daughter.

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:48.740
Now, as Jesus walked with Jairus to his home,

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.740
another story unfolds.

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:56.740
It's a story that had been 12 years in the making.

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:03.740
Let's pick up the reading at verses 25 and 26 of Mark chapter 5.

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:04.740
It says,

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:09.740
Now, there was a woman who had a flow of blood for 12 years.

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:13.740
She had suffered much at the hands of many physicians

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:16.740
and had spent all her resources.

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:20.740
And she was no better, but rather had become worse.

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:25.740
What a difficult situation it was for this poor woman,

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:31.740
the toll this disease must have taken on her body and her mind.

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:35.740
Every day when she went to bed, she knew that when she woke up,

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:40.740
she would be faced with this burden to greet her.

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.740
She felt trapped. She felt imprisoned.

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:49.740
The constancy of this chronic illness was enough to drive her to madness.

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:56.740
This woman was damaged physically, emotionally, mentally,

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:58.740
and even financially.

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:05.740
But she had enough faith to touch the fringes of Jesus garment

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:10.740
and she was healed as you see in verses 27 to 29.

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:18.740
But note Jesus' reaction when she touched him, verses 30 to 33.

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:23.740
Immediately, Jesus realized in himself that power had gone out of him.

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.740
And he turned around in the crowd and asked,

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.740
Who touched my outer garments?

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.740
But his disciples said to him,

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:37.740
You see the crowd pressing in on you and you ask, Who touched me?

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.740
However, he was looking around to see who had done this.

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.740
The woman frightened and trembling,

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.740
knowing what had happened to her came and fell down before him

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.740
and told him the whole truth.

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:56.149
Who touched my outer garments?

00:04:56.149 --> 00:04:59.149
Who touched me?

00:04:59.149 --> 00:05:05.149
The implications of those questions are far-reaching.

00:05:05.149 --> 00:05:10.149
Jesus was literally wondering who touched him in a physical sense,

00:05:10.149 --> 00:05:17.149
but it was more than just the physical touch that Jesus was interested in.

00:05:17.149 --> 00:05:24.149
Verse 30 says that when she touched Jesus, he realized that power had gone out from him.

00:05:24.149 --> 00:05:30.149
So Jesus did not directly heal this woman as he did in other instances,

00:05:30.149 --> 00:05:33.149
such as when he reached out to touch the hand of the leper,

00:05:33.149 --> 00:05:36.149
or he reached out to touch the eyes of the blind man.

00:05:36.149 --> 00:05:39.149
He knew that this healing was different.

00:05:39.149 --> 00:05:44.149
This was the direct work of his father, Jehovah.

00:05:44.149 --> 00:05:49.149
Jehovah healed this woman and Jesus wanted to know who it was

00:05:49.149 --> 00:05:56.149
that his heavenly father was so interested in that he would be willing to heal this woman in this way.

00:05:56.149 --> 00:05:58.149
Jehovah knew her story.

00:05:58.149 --> 00:06:01.149
Jesus wanted to know it too.

00:06:01.149 --> 00:06:07.149
So in verse 33, Jesus listened to the whole truth,

00:06:07.149 --> 00:06:16.149
and Jesus got to understand why his father loved this woman so much.

00:06:16.149 --> 00:06:19.149
What was the whole truth?

00:06:19.149 --> 00:06:22.149
What was her name?

00:06:22.149 --> 00:06:25.149
How old was she?

00:06:25.149 --> 00:06:27.149
Was she ever married?

00:06:27.149 --> 00:06:32.149
Did her husband leave her because of her illness?

00:06:32.149 --> 00:06:35.149
Did her children abandon her?

00:06:35.149 --> 00:06:39.149
We only know what is recorded in the gospel accounts.

00:06:39.149 --> 00:06:48.149
But whatever the whole truth was, Jesus allowed that woman to express her whole story,

00:06:48.149 --> 00:06:53.149
and it moved him not to chastise her because she broke a law,

00:06:53.149 --> 00:07:05.009
but it moved her or him to love her because now he knew who she was because she touched him.

00:07:05.009 --> 00:07:12.009
About 15 years ago, I was in a class with presiding overseers as they were known at the time,

00:07:12.009 --> 00:07:16.009
and I noticed a brother in the front of the class who never answered.

00:07:16.009 --> 00:07:18.009
He never raised his hand.

00:07:18.009 --> 00:07:24.009
He was very disengaged, and mostly he just stared at the whiteboard.

00:07:24.009 --> 00:07:28.009
So I said to myself, I wonder what he's thinking.

00:07:28.009 --> 00:07:34.009
It's so sad he's missing out on all this good education.

00:07:34.009 --> 00:07:41.009
Then the instructor asked the question, how many of you had challenges coming to school?

00:07:41.009 --> 00:07:47.009
Lo and behold, he raises his hand, and the instructor calls on him.

00:07:47.009 --> 00:07:51.009
We're shocked waiting for what he's going to say.

00:07:51.009 --> 00:07:54.009
This is what he said.

00:07:54.009 --> 00:08:02.009
Brothers, I have a serious brain disease, and only have months to live.

00:08:02.009 --> 00:08:08.009
My only prayer was just to live long enough to attend this class.

00:08:08.009 --> 00:08:15.009
It's been hard to concentrate, but I'm here and I'm thankful.

00:08:15.009 --> 00:08:23.009
Today is Thursday, and if I die today, I'll die the happiest man who ever lived.

00:08:23.009 --> 00:08:28.629
I misjudged that man.

00:08:28.629 --> 00:08:36.629
I viewed him as disinterested and disengaged, and he was struggling just to stay alive.

00:08:36.629 --> 00:08:39.629
He touched me that day.

00:08:39.629 --> 00:08:43.629
He touched me in a way I will never forget.

00:08:43.629 --> 00:08:50.629
Every brother or sister who comes into your life is like a book that contains a beautiful story.

00:08:50.629 --> 00:08:57.629
Take time to open the book, ask them questions, thumb through the pages of their life.

00:08:57.629 --> 00:09:02.629
You'll be amazed at what you learn and what you come to love about them,

00:09:02.629 --> 00:09:06.629
because now you know their story.

00:09:06.629 --> 00:09:11.629
You know why Jehovah loves them.

00:09:11.629 --> 00:09:14.629
But remember, not everyone is the same.

00:09:14.629 --> 00:09:20.629
Some will tell you the whole story, and you wonder, is there any end to this story?

00:09:20.629 --> 00:09:26.629
But then others will tell you very little because they're very private, but that's okay.

00:09:26.629 --> 00:09:29.629
Everyone's touch is different.

00:09:29.629 --> 00:09:35.629
Just take the initiative and be satisfied with whatever they are willing to give you.

00:09:35.629 --> 00:09:38.629
Let's go back to Mark chapter 5.

00:09:38.629 --> 00:09:45.629
After Jesus was touched by this woman's whole story, note what Jesus did to touch her.

00:09:45.629 --> 00:09:47.629
Verse 34.

00:09:47.629 --> 00:09:53.629
He said to her, daughter, your faith has made you well.

00:09:53.629 --> 00:09:59.629
Go in peace. Be healed from your grievous sickness.

00:09:59.629 --> 00:10:03.629
Jesus did more than heal her body.

00:10:03.629 --> 00:10:08.629
He or his tender words healed her mind and her heart.

00:10:08.629 --> 00:10:11.629
He restored that woman's dignity.

00:10:11.629 --> 00:10:17.139
He made her feel good about herself.

00:10:17.139 --> 00:10:20.139
Class 157 in the days ahead.

00:10:20.139 --> 00:10:27.139
Work to foster an atmosphere in your assignment where people feel valued,

00:10:27.139 --> 00:10:32.139
where they feel appreciated, where their presence really means something.

00:10:32.139 --> 00:10:34.139
Listen to their whole story.

00:10:34.139 --> 00:10:38.139
Let their stories deepen your empathy.

00:10:38.139 --> 00:10:41.139
Let their faith strengthen your heart.

00:10:41.139 --> 00:10:47.139
Let their struggles help you to realize that we're all in this together.

00:10:47.139 --> 00:10:49.139
That's what Jesus did.

00:10:49.139 --> 00:10:51.139
That's what we can do.

00:10:51.139 --> 00:10:59.899
So when this day ends and you're getting ready for bed, take a moment to think.

00:10:59.899 --> 00:11:04.899
Think about someone that came into your life today.

00:11:04.899 --> 00:11:08.690
How did they touch you?

00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:13.690
But here's an even better question for you to contemplate in the days ahead.

00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:17.690
When you are in your assignment, Class 157,

00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:22.690
whose life will you take time to touch?
