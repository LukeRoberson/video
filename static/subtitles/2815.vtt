00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:09.380
Welcome. We're happy to share some encouraging updates with you.

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:16.500
Since our last update, two special conventions were held in Harare, Zimbabwe, and one was

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:26.980
held in Colombo, Sri Lanka. They combined peak attendance was over 64,600 at these locations,

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:38.659
and 1,330 were baptized. More than 7,000 delegates came from over 20 lands. Beginning with the

00:00:38.659 --> 00:00:48.179
2026 convention series, the term special conventions will be replaced with international conventions.

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:57.060
We'll have international conventions of varying sizes each year. As announced in our last update,

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:04.900
we'll hold 19 international conventions around the world in 2026.

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.700
Delegates will enjoy sharing in the field ministry,

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:16.900
associating with local brothers and sisters, and taking part in other activities.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:26.900
In August 2025, a new visitor's center was opened at the Central Europe branch office,

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:35.700
located in Shelter's Germany. Let's take a look. A highlight of the visitor's center is the new

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:42.019
Bible Museum, featuring the theme, and there was light, the history of the Bible in German.

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:50.260
This unique Bible Museum tells the story of the rich history and enduring impact of the German Bible.

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:57.780
Visitors can see rare and fascinating Bibles produced during the very early years of Bible printing.

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:04.980
Visitors will see how the Bible was initially printed in Latin, but later began to be printed

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:11.620
in the German language. The museum also shows how the printing and distribution of the German Bible

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.939
stimulated the production of the Bible in other European languages.

00:02:17.139 --> 00:02:23.620
Local news media covered the museum opening and highlighted the museum's educational value.

00:02:24.419 --> 00:02:31.139
We invite you to visit this new museum at the Central Europe branch office. You can request a

00:02:31.139 --> 00:02:43.659
tour via jw.org. As Jehovah's people, we view the Bible as more than a vital piece of history.

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:53.819
It's more than just a good book. We need Jehovah's direction, just like we need food, clothing,

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:58.620
and shelter. That's how Jehovah created us.

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:07.580
Jesus highlighted this truth in a simple but powerful statement recorded at Matthew 5-3.

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:16.139
Happy are those conscious of their spiritual need since the kingdom of the heavens belongs to them.

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:23.900
To be truly happy, we must be aware of our spiritual need and take steps to satisfy it.

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:30.060
But what does it mean to be conscious of our spiritual need?

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:38.780
The original Greek expression conveys the idea of being a beggar for the spirit.

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:47.900
Picture a person in rags, crouched on a street corner. He's weak from hunger and exposed to

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:56.219
the elements. He begs for help to improve his lot in life. Now what's the point?

00:03:57.259 --> 00:04:06.620
A person who is conscious of his spiritual need knows that he needs Jehovah's help and he eagerly

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:14.780
seeks it. What qualities must we have in order to be conscious of our spiritual need?

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:22.540
Let's see what we learn from the account of the Phoenician woman. It's described at Matthew

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:32.139
chapter 15 verses 22 through 28. Notice how she approached Jesus and interacted with him.

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:40.139
It says, and look, a Phoenician woman from that region came and cried out. Have mercy on me,

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:47.980
Lord, son of David. My daughter is cruelly demon possessed, but he did not say a word in

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:57.339
answer to her. So his disciples came and began to urge him, send her away, because she keeps cried out

00:04:57.339 --> 00:05:05.980
after us. He answered, I was not sent to anyone except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel,

00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:16.459
but the woman came and did obeisance to him, saying, Lord, help me. In answer, he said,

00:05:16.459 --> 00:05:23.660
it is not right to take the bread of the children and throw it to the little dogs. She said, yes,

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:31.259
Lord, but really the little dogs do eat of the crumbs falling from the table of their masters.

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:39.980
Then Jesus replied to her, oh woman, great is your faith. Let it happen to you as you wish.

00:05:40.939 --> 00:05:48.220
And her daughter was healed from that hour on. This woman was a Gentile, a Phoenician.

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:59.259
Yet she approached Jesus with a desperate plea. Have mercy on me. At first Jesus didn't respond.

00:05:59.819 --> 00:06:04.939
Then he said, he was sent only to the lost sheep of Israel.

00:06:05.819 --> 00:06:14.699
And finally, he used an illustration that likened her to a little dog. How would you have

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:24.300
reacted? Would you have felt insulted or even given up? This woman didn't. She showed three

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:33.259
beautiful qualities that can help us to satisfy our spiritual need. Here they are, humility,

00:06:34.939 --> 00:06:46.459
persistence and faith. Because she was humble, she didn't argue or take offense. She accepted

00:06:46.459 --> 00:06:57.899
her position and still appealed to Jesus' mercy. She was persistent. She kept asking

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:07.980
even when the disciples urged Jesus to send her away. And she had strong faith. She believed

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:13.420
Jesus could help her, even if all she got were the crumbs of his attention.

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:23.500
Jesus was so moved by her faith that he did something remarkable. He healed her daughter,

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:32.779
even though she was not an Israelite. This account teaches us that Jehovah and Jesus are eager

00:07:32.779 --> 00:07:40.379
to help those who are truly conscious of their spiritual need. Like the Phoenician woman,

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:53.980
we must develop humility, persistence and faith. Earlier, we likened our spiritual need to our

00:07:53.980 --> 00:08:05.100
physical needs, things like food, clothing and shelter. But how can we gain spiritual food,

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:12.779
clothing and shelter? Let's see how Jehovah provides these for us. First,

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:22.540
let's think about spiritual food. Before Jesus ascended to heaven, he told the apostle Peter,

00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:31.740
feed my little sheep. Peter did just that. Jehovah even urged him to write two letters that

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:42.620
became part of the Bible. But Peter also needed to nourish himself with spiritual food. For example,

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:52.299
he studied the inspired letters that the apostle Paul wrote. Peter acknowledged that some of the

00:08:52.299 --> 00:09:04.139
things Paul wrote about were hard to understand amen. But Peter didn't give up. He had faith

00:09:04.139 --> 00:09:13.259
that Jehovah would help him to understand and apply the solid food in those inspired letters.

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:23.659
Like Peter, we must regularly feed on the truths of God's Word. We must develop an appetite

00:09:23.659 --> 00:09:32.139
for a solid spiritual food, truths that may be hard to understand at first. Of course, this takes

00:09:32.139 --> 00:09:42.379
time and effort, but it's worth it. His strengthens our love for Jehovah and it motivates us to tell

00:09:42.379 --> 00:09:52.639
others about him. What about the spiritual clothing? At Colossians 3, 9 and 10, the apostle Paul

00:09:52.639 --> 00:10:01.279
wrote, strip off the old personality with its practices and clothe yourselves with the new

00:10:01.279 --> 00:10:09.279
personality. Paul lived those words. Before he was a Christian, he had a hot temper.

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:16.879
Acts 9-1 says that he was so angry with the disciples of Jesus that he was

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:26.480
breathing threat and murder against them. After Saul had a miraculous vision of Jesus,

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:34.960
he was moved to repent. But his work didn't end there. Paul had to keep pummeling his body,

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:42.559
fighting his imperfections. And with Jehovah's help, he stripped off his negative traits.

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:54.159
He clothe himself with the new personality. We want to do the same. No matter how long we've

00:10:54.159 --> 00:11:02.159
been serving Jehovah, we need to keep working at it. At times, we might become discouraged. We

00:11:02.159 --> 00:11:11.039
thought we had already stripped it all off. And then we noticed that some part of that old

00:11:11.039 --> 00:11:21.759
personality has reappeared. What do we do? We keep stripping it off and keep putting on the new

00:11:21.759 --> 00:11:32.240
personality. That's the wonderful spiritual clothing that Jehovah supplies. To be truly happy,

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:42.399
we need more than spiritual food and spiritual clothing. What do we need? We also need spiritual

00:11:42.399 --> 00:11:51.279
shelter. King David spoke about it at Psalm 27-5. Speaking of Jehovah, David wrote,

00:11:52.000 --> 00:12:02.000
for he will hide me in his shelter on the day of calamity. He will conceal me in the secret

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:11.120
place of his tent. High on a rock, he will place me. When David obeyed Jehovah, he was protected

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:19.360
from the harm that comes to those who willfully stand. But when David ignored God's standards,

00:12:20.159 --> 00:12:28.799
Jehovah did not shelter him from the consequences. We can imitate David by seeking Jehovah's

00:12:28.799 --> 00:12:37.840
counsel when we make decisions. At times, we may suffer hardship, not because Jehovah has failed

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:47.039
to shelter us, but because we've made poor decisions. At other times, we may face trials

00:12:47.039 --> 00:12:58.000
through no fault of our own. What do we do then? We pour out our heart to Jehovah in prayer. And

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:07.600
what does Jehovah do? He guards our hearts and our thoughts. He'll protect us from anything that

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:18.740
could permanently harm our faith. We're grateful that Jehovah provides spiritual food, clothing,

00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:29.700
and shelter. Thanks to Jehovah, we have everything we need to survive. And to be truly happy,

00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:40.419
remember Jesus' words at Matthew 5-3? Happy are those conscious of their spiritual need. To help

00:13:40.419 --> 00:13:51.779
us remember this key to happiness. Matthew 5-3 has been chosen as the year text for 2026.

00:13:52.659 --> 00:14:02.980
May we never forget these vital words. Happy are those conscious of their spiritual need.

00:14:03.779 --> 00:14:13.539
We're also excited to announce a new original song based on Matthew 5-3. It's entitled My

00:14:13.539 --> 00:14:25.379
Spiritual Need. This new song beautifully expresses our desire to keep feeding our faith and walking

00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:34.820
with Jehovah. We look forward to singing this new song together at the upcoming annual meeting.

00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:48.580
It will become song 162 in our songbook. It's now available for download in English and in a number

00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:55.539
of other languages. Additional languages will be added as they become available.

00:14:57.139 --> 00:15:06.419
Remember brothers, to be conscious of our spiritual need, we must remain humble, be persistent,

00:15:07.299 --> 00:15:16.100
and have strong faith in our God, Jehovah. With the help of those wonderful qualities,

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:24.820
we will feel our spiritual need every day. And once more, we'll be truly happy.

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:37.299
Brothers and sisters, we love you all very much. From the world headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses,
