00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:08.000
He is famously the object and not the subject of a Bible account.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:17.300
We easily sympathize with him because we can understand his emotions and feelings at the time.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:26.399
Yet his response is that which provides a powerful life lesson in our service to God.

00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:33.310
We're introduced to him in the book of Mark chapter 14.

00:00:33.409 --> 00:00:39.259
Mark chapter 14 beginning in verse 50.

00:00:39.259 --> 00:00:44.659
Verse 50 picks up the account of Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane.

00:00:44.659 --> 00:00:53.159
And we read of the 11 faithful apostles and they all abandoned him and fled.

00:00:53.159 --> 00:01:01.060
However, a certain young man wearing only a fine linen garment over his naked body began to follow him nearby

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:07.760
and they tried to seize him, but he left his linen garment behind and got away naked.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:13.560
The young man in this verse is understood to be John Mark.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.379
And notice John Mark's outstanding quality.

00:01:18.379 --> 00:01:26.680
When the apostles all fled, it says John Mark followed nearby.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.879
What tremendous courage of this young man.

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:37.579
While the great man, the apostles fled, Mark stayed and he followed nearby.

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:41.780
Now, interestingly, we know that Peter eventually also followed,

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:50.480
but notice this about Peter in verse 54, but Peter from a good distance followed.

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.680
John Mark followed nearby.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:02:00.879
In this, we see not only the courage of John Mark, but we also see his devotion to Jesus.

00:02:00.879 --> 00:02:05.379
To what extent he knew Jesus or had interactions with Jesus, we don't know.

00:02:05.379 --> 00:02:14.020
But he did have some and his devotion and courage for his master is unquestionable here.

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.819
The scriptures also describe Mark.

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:19.120
John Mark has a strengthening aid and a great comfort.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.419
Those were the observations of him later in his life.

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.319
And we do know from the scriptures that John Mark worked in the background

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:35.719
for some very big personalities, the Apostle Paul, the Apostle Peter and Barnabas.

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:39.719
John Mark initially caught the attention of the apostles of Paul and Barnabas

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:42.719
when he was in Jerusalem.

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:50.219
Paul or Saul at the time and Barnabas came there in 46 CE.

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:55.120
And they took John Mark with them to the exciting assignment of Antioch

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:01.120
where Christianity was beginning to flourish and John Mark was brought along with them.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:06.819
Later in the year 47, John Mark is selected to go with Barnabas and Saul

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:09.319
on the first missionary tour.

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:15.280
It's described for us in the book of Acts chapter 13.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.080
In Acts chapter 13, verses 4 and 5, it says,

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.580
So these men, that is Barnabas and Saul, sent out by Holy Spirit,

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:29.180
went down to Salusia and from there they sailed away to Cyprus.

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.979
When they arrived in Salamis, they began proclaiming the word of God

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:33.979
and the synagogues of the Jews.

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:37.780
They also had John as an attendant.

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.979
John Mark.

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:45.280
He is described here as an attendant, the footnote says an assistant.

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.979
The writer of Acts uses a very interesting word here for attendant

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:53.379
and it's a Greek word that literally means an under-roar.

00:03:53.379 --> 00:04:01.479
An under-roar was a man who worked below the decks on a large Roman naval vessel.

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:03.080
He would be below deck.

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:07.780
He would have to row in unison in cooperation with his fellow rowers

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:12.379
and he would have to follow the pace set by the captain.

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:15.979
Why would this term be used for John Mark in this instance?

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:22.180
Well, the clue comes from verse 4 where it says they sailed away to Cyprus.

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:27.480
So the metaphor of an under-roar now takes on greater meaning.

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.579
Incidentally, the same term is used by the Apostle Paul

00:04:30.579 --> 00:04:34.579
when he refers to himself as a servant of God or an attendant

00:04:34.579 --> 00:04:36.980
in 1 Corinthians chapter 4.

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:38.480
Why would that be significant?

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.779
Why use it in 1 Corinthians?

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:43.379
Because in one of the bays next to Corinth,

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:48.379
the large ships of the Roman navy took port there

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:54.579
and so again the metaphor of the under-roar would take on great meaning.

00:04:54.579 --> 00:05:00.579
Well, the infamous event occurred in Acts chapter 15,

00:05:00.579 --> 00:05:06.379
the event which Barnabas or a part of me, John Mark was an object of.

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:12.579
Notice in Acts chapter 15, beginning in verse 37 it says,

00:05:12.579 --> 00:05:17.180
Barnabas was determined to take along John who was called Mark.

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:21.079
Paul, however, was not in favor of taking him along with them,

00:05:21.079 --> 00:05:24.079
seeing that he had departed from them in Pamphilia

00:05:24.079 --> 00:05:26.980
and had not gone with them to the work.

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:29.980
At this, there was a sharp burst of anger

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:32.079
so that they separated from each other

00:05:32.079 --> 00:05:37.779
and Barnabas took Mark along and sailed away to Cyprus.

00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:41.879
Denied an opportunity, denied a privilege.

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:44.480
What does Mark do?

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:49.079
It says he sailed away with Barnabas to Cyprus.

00:05:49.079 --> 00:05:53.779
Mark kept active in Jehovah's service.

00:05:53.779 --> 00:05:56.180
How does he do that?

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:01.579
Paul, pardon me, John Mark was not so concerned about a lost privilege

00:06:01.579 --> 00:06:08.089
that he failed to appreciate the opportunities that were in front of him.

00:06:08.089 --> 00:06:11.490
Well, while he's sailing away and working,

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:12.790
what's Paul doing?

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:16.689
Verse 41, 40 and 41 say Paul selected Silas.

00:06:16.689 --> 00:06:22.889
41 says he went through Syria and Salisia strengthening the congregations.

00:06:22.889 --> 00:06:28.990
Now, as you carry on in chapter 16, we find him arriving in Derbe and Listera.

00:06:29.089 --> 00:06:34.290
And verse 3, pardon me, verse 1 says he met Timothy, a disciple.

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:35.990
Verse 3, what happens?

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:43.189
Paul expressed a desire for Timothy to join him.

00:06:43.189 --> 00:06:46.519
Mark's replacement.

00:06:46.519 --> 00:06:50.220
Interestingly, as Paul now begins to travel with Timothy,

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:56.019
we find that the Apostle Paul writes to the Thessalonians within a year.

00:06:56.019 --> 00:07:03.519
And in 1 Thessalonians 1 verse 1, Paul's greeting is from Paul, Silas, and Timothy.

00:07:03.519 --> 00:07:09.019
2 Thessalonians, 2 from Paul, Silas, and Timothy.

00:07:09.019 --> 00:07:13.420
I wonder how Timothy's, pardon me, I wonder how Mark's feeling at this point.

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:20.220
Five years later, he writes to the Corinthians, and again, now it's from Paul and Timothy.

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:26.019
During all this time where Timothy is rising, what's Mark doing?

00:07:26.019 --> 00:07:28.019
He's rowing.

00:07:28.019 --> 00:07:33.920
Mark is continually faithfully serving Jehovah 11 years later in the year 60 to 61

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:37.120
when Paul was in Rome, who was with him?

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:39.120
John Mark.

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:45.120
And when Paul wrote letters to various congregations, he describes John Mark.

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:48.720
In fact, in one of the letters in sending greetings, this is in Colossians,

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:52.819
he makes reference to the fact that he had wanted to send John Mark

00:07:52.819 --> 00:07:57.519
as a personal representative to the congregations.

00:07:57.519 --> 00:08:03.620
And that indicates to us what kind of man Mark was and what reputation he had.

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:08.120
A personal representative was someone who was deeply trusted

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:12.819
and he would have to represent Paul before the congregations that he would visit.

00:08:12.819 --> 00:08:15.720
That is the reputation of John Mark.

00:08:15.819 --> 00:08:20.819
You know, there's no record in the scriptures of the challenges that John Mark faced

00:08:20.819 --> 00:08:22.019
in his ministry.

00:08:22.019 --> 00:08:26.220
There's no shipwrecks, no beatings, no hunger, no left for dead for John Mark,

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:30.920
but there is one challenge that he faced that is shared with us.

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:38.120
And that is his difficulty or the challenge with the Apostle Paul, his brother.

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:41.820
And yet clearly, there were no hard feelings between these two men,

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:44.120
even though there was a difference.

00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:48.820
In fact, Paul's final words chronologically in the book of 2 Timothy chapter 4

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:52.419
in reference to John Mark, he tells Timothy,

00:08:52.419 --> 00:08:59.899
bring Mark, he's helpful, the underroer, John Mark.

00:08:59.899 --> 00:09:02.899
Interestingly, for all that we know about Timothy,

00:09:02.899 --> 00:09:08.500
there are no words recorded of Timothy's in the scriptures.

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:12.399
And yet, John Mark wrote a gospel.

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:17.700
And as a typical underroer, he never mentioned his name.

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:22.700
So when we put the pieces together of what is shared of John Mark in the scriptures,

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:28.100
we get a portrait of a man who was one zealous for promoting the good news

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:33.299
in the worldwide field and to happy to serve others.

00:09:33.299 --> 00:09:37.500
This alone is worthy of our imitation.

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:40.200
But there is more.

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:47.899
In your future, you may be the object caught up in a Paul and Barnabas moment.

00:09:47.899 --> 00:09:54.899
You may face changed circumstances due to health or family issues.

00:09:54.899 --> 00:09:59.700
You may be the one who has to work in the shadow of Timothy.

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:04.799
A door may close for you or be closed for you.

00:10:04.799 --> 00:10:09.799
But like Mark, do not be so concerned about lost privileges

00:10:09.799 --> 00:10:15.399
that you fail to appreciate the opportunities that are right in front of you.

00:10:15.399 --> 00:10:21.000
May you, like Mark, keep your heart and your hands strong.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
Keep them on the oars.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:29.000
Work in unison, cooperate with your brothers and sisters for the master.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.200
May you, like Mark, be the underroer.
