00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:09.539
When someone loses a spouse, they are a widower.

00:00:09.539 --> 00:00:13.539
When someone loses their parents, they're an orphan.

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:19.460
But there's no word for when you lose your children.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:30.539
In 1948, I was born in a rendered Minnesota.

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.539
We'd ever had a Bible in our house.

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:36.539
I asked my dad one time about God and he said,

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:38.539
God knows everything.

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:43.539
In the lesson, my dad had heartening of the arteries.

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:48.539
In 1962, he died of heart attack.

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.539
I just turned 13 and my parents were so close that my mother,

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:57.539
who had colon cancer, she gave up the will to live.

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.539
So in February, the next year, she died.

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:05.540
About 1972, that's when I met Pam.

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.540
I was born in Portland, Oregon.

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.540
I was one of those high-strung children.

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.540
I still am.

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.540
I worried about a lot of things.

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.540
I already had two children by the time I met Larry

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.540
and I didn't want them to inherit a world

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.540
that was just filled with killing each other.

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.540
I joined a lot of the movements.

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.540
I marched in the peace marches with thousands and thousands of people.

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.540
I thought, well, I'll go door to door for this particular canopy

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.540
because he's anti-war.

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.540
All these things I was doing to put forth all this effort

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.540
to change things, it wasn't working.

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.260
Pam and I had gotten married.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:56.260
Nicky was born and we were just the static, very happy.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.260
He had this group and we took him to the hospital.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.260
And there was a doctor there and he diagnosed it

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.260
as a taxia telling detasies.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.259
And it's a progressive disorder.

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:15.020
There's no cure for it.

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.020
Pam was pregnant the second time and he had the familial Thomas.

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:25.020
And he, too, had this condition of a taxia.

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.020
I cried.

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.020
I cried and cried.

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.020
I cried my eyes out during that time.

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:38.750
So the witnesses found me

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.750
and they just kept calling and talking to me and being so kind to me

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.180
when we studied that.

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.180
Jesus talked about that little sparrow even is important to him

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.180
and how much more important a human is.

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.180
So that meant a lot to me.

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:03.930
After Pam was baptized, I could see changes

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.930
that this was good for the family.

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.930
Once we were in the congregation, everybody loved them

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.930
and all the friends were wonderful.

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.930
She told me that I could study with any brother in the hall that I wanted.

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.930
Just go ask them.

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:19.930
So I did.

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.930
That helped me to be a better father.

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:29.349
And to be a better husband.

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:33.349
In 1986, October of that year,

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:35.349
our oldest boy, Niggie,

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:38.349
he fell asleep in death.

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:43.849
He was 13 when he died.

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:49.349
Our youngest boy, Nate, was 16 when he died.

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:51.349
Debbie, she had melanoma

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:55.349
and had gone into her brain and she had brain tumors.

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:58.349
Well, she didn't last but a couple months

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:02.349
and she fell asleep in death.

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:04.349
There we were.

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:09.240
We had a complete empty nest.

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:13.240
And about that time, Pam got diagnosed with breast cancer.

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:15.240
The first came with therapy.

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:17.240
There were two just about killed me.

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:19.240
It came early close

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:22.240
because it was hard to even breathe sometimes.

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:27.550
Two bites of breast cancer is to kept on pioneering.

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.550
When Larry got hurt,

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.550
following that through the ceiling,

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.550
the whole left side of his face

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:36.550
hit the corner of the metal wood stove

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:38.550
and broke it all the way through.

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:43.550
He had to be fed by a tube through a little opening in his teeth.

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:45.550
Second Corinthians,

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.550
the first chapter verses three and four

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:50.550
talks about the God of all comfort.

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.550
It's easy to be comfortable

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:56.500
when everything's going well.

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.500
When these kind of things happen

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.500
to find true comfort

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:16.800
is within Jehovah's organization.

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.800
You can go through something

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.800
and you can still keep a Theocratic routine.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:31.100
A Theocratic routine is what helps us to endure.

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:37.100
We knew that we would like to end this system of things as pioneers.

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:41.100
Larry and their answers together almost every single day.

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:44.100
We found that pioneering together

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:48.100
and having Bible studies together is very powerful.

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:53.100
We've helped on a regional building project together.

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:57.100
It's a wonderful spiritual time.

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:59.100
You don't rely on yourself.

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:02.100
You have to rely on Jehovah.

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:04.100
When Jehovah loves you,

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:06.100
he takes care of you,

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:09.660
keeps you on your feet.

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:11.660
Every day I remember my children.

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:13.660
You don't forget the people you love.

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:15.660
And if you love Jehovah,

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:17.660
you won't forget him.

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:19.660
God is love.

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:23.660
And that love is what helps us to be able to endure.
