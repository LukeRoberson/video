00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.789
Part of me, good women.

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:31.589
I heard that Jesus the Nazarene is somewhere in the area.

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:32.789
Have you seen him?

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:35.289
Why are you seeking him out?

00:00:35.289 --> 00:00:37.390
Are you one of his disciples?

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:38.890
Are you one of his servants?

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.390
My dear woman, from what I hear the size of the crowds

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.390
will not allow you to come near Jesus.

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.590
Do not even dream of meeting him.

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.390
Sisters, sisters, where is your love of strangers?

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.390
Please excuse the rudeness.

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.490
How can we be of assistance?

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:58.789
Come, sit here with us.

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:01.189
Thank you.

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:04.290
I have an urgent need to meet the Lord Jesus.

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.890
Well, I'm not sure he's any kind of Lord,

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.989
but I can tell you I've heard no reports about Jesus being around here.

00:01:10.989 --> 00:01:13.189
Are you related to him?

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:14.489
No.

00:01:14.489 --> 00:01:18.189
But I heard that he's curing the sick.

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:22.489
And I'm a very sick woman.

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.489
I've suffered from a flow of blood for some 12 years.

00:01:27.489 --> 00:01:32.469
I've been unable to get a cure from anyone.

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:38.569
And I've suffered so much at the hands of many physicians.

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:43.870
All of my money has been spent on this dreadful condition.

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:47.870
And after all these efforts, am I better?

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:49.469
No.

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:53.629
I've become worse.

00:01:53.629 --> 00:02:00.030
When I heard about Jesus and the miracles that he has performed,

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.230
I knew he must be from God.

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:05.629
I have faith in his power.

00:02:05.629 --> 00:02:13.629
He can heal me, even if I could touch just the fringes of his outer garment.

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:23.620
I will get well, surely die.

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:29.520
Teacher, teacher, again, I plead with you.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.620
My little daughter is extremely ill.

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.120
Please, come and put your hands on her so she may get well and live.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.120
Please, come to my house.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.719
Jesus, this is Jeris, one of the presiding officers of the synagogue.

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:47.120
He has been begging for your help.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.020
Jeris, where is your daughter?

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.520
Please, take me to her.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:51.919
She's a beautiful girl.

00:02:51.919 --> 00:02:53.719
She's my only daughter.

00:02:53.719 --> 00:02:56.319
She's only 12 years old and she is dying.

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:59.120
Please, come quickly.

00:02:59.219 --> 00:03:00.719
I will come.

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:16.439
Please, lead the way.

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:18.840
Who touched my outer garments?

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.840
Who touched me?

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.039
Not me, my Lord.

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:25.240
Peter, James, did one of you touch me?

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.340
No, my Lord.

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.240
Jesus, surely you can see the crowds pressing in on you.

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:30.039
Can you ask?

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:30.740
Who touched me?

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:32.039
Someone touched me.

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:34.639
For I know that power went out of me.

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:46.590
Woman, did you touch the Lord?

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.689
I have touched you.

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:56.500
I merely touched the fringes of his outer garments.

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.199
Have no fear.

00:03:58.199 --> 00:04:00.400
You've done nothing wrong.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.139
Tell me, why did you touch my garment?

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:11.139
My Lord, I have been very ill for 12 years.

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:15.039
Many physicians have treated me.

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:19.040
I have spent all that I had trying to find a cure,

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.839
but my condition got no better.

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:24.639
Rather, I got worse.

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:27.240
I've heard about you.

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.540
I have faith in you.

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:33.740
I knew that if I could just touch the fringes

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.040
of your outer garment, I could get well.

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.439
Forgive me.

00:04:38.439 --> 00:04:42.600
I just wanted to get well.

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.600
Take courage, daughter.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:54.029
Your faith has made you well.

00:04:54.029 --> 00:04:57.230
Go in peace and be healed from your grievous sickness.
