00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:04.759
Welcome to JW Broadcasting.

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:09.859
We have some encouraging things to look forward to in this month's program.

00:00:09.859 --> 00:00:13.560
We'll hear the experiences of Sister Agapeta Reis.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.660
As a Christian wife and mother,

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.960
she successfully met the challenges of raising a family by applying Bible principles.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.359
What helped her to remain steadfast throughout her life?

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:31.359
How can you maintain focus even after you achieve a spiritual goal?

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:35.659
Could subtle temptations and distractions take you off course?

00:00:35.659 --> 00:00:40.340
We'll discuss an important quality that can help you.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.240
Parents are proud of young ones who give their best to Jehovah.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.740
Their feelings are a reflection of how Jehovah feels.

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:53.340
And are the inspiration for this month's music video.

00:00:53.340 --> 00:01:16.829
This is JW Broadcasting for August 2017.

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:23.430
The complexity found in nature has inspired amazing achievements in technology.

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.329
But it has also moved people to ask,

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:28.730
was it designed?

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:33.629
That's the title of an awake series that first appeared in 2008.

00:01:33.629 --> 00:01:38.329
It's been a powerful tool to turn people's attention to Jehovah,

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:41.329
the creator of all things.

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:45.430
We're pleased to introduce the first in an exciting new video series

00:01:45.430 --> 00:02:12.580
based on those articles.

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:19.180
The trunk of the African elephant is an impressive multi-tool.

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.180
It is both flexible and strong.

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.879
It can pick up a blade of grass,

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:33.780
or uprooted tree.

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.479
Some elephants can use their trunks to feed themselves

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:51.879
around 270 kilograms of vegetation every day

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:53.680
with their trunks.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:03:01.650
They can suck water like a straw,

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.650
spray like a fountain,

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:11.530
and swim with a snorkel.

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.979
The trunk can give a gentle touch.

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:20.060
Give a strong push,

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.860
or sound a warning trumpet.

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.560
Engineers admire the elephant trunks remarkable flexibility.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.060
This comes from having no bone.

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:36.960
Instead, it contains about 150,000 muscle units,

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:41.460
an incredible marriage of strength and structure.

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:43.960
Inspired by the elephant's trunk,

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:48.860
researchers are designing robots for the future with greater flexibility.

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.460
Industrial design often can be made better

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:58.259
by copying the perfectly beautiful solutions in the natural world.

00:03:58.259 --> 00:04:01.060
What do you think?

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:06.800
Did the elephant's trunk evolve?

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:13.379
Or?

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:15.979
This new video series can help you see the proof

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:19.279
that there is a creator.

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:21.980
It can especially help you young ones to recognize

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:26.579
and reject the false teaching of evolution.

00:04:26.579 --> 00:04:29.379
Use these new videos in your personal study

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:32.879
and share them with classmates and teachers.

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:35.279
They'll help you give an effective witness

00:04:35.279 --> 00:04:37.879
and bring honor to Jehovah.

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:43.379
You'll find them in the video on demand section of JW Broadcasting.

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:45.379
Young ones need strong faith

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:48.480
in this difficult system of things.

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.480
But they are not alone.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:53.680
They have Jehovah's Holy Spirit,

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.480
a congregation of brothers and sisters,

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:00.879
and very often loving Christian parents.

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:02.680
In Monterey, Mexico,

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.079
sister Agapeta Reyes set a beautiful example

00:05:06.079 --> 00:05:09.379
in building up the faith of her children.

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:18.980
What circumstances made that effort a special challenge?

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:24.170
It's not easy raising kids in the truth,

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:30.879
and I had ten.

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:33.980
I learned the truth when I was 19.

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:36.279
Some witnesses came to preach in our town

00:05:36.279 --> 00:05:39.579
and my father offered them a place to stay.

00:05:39.579 --> 00:05:42.079
He spoke with them all through the night

00:05:42.079 --> 00:05:45.680
and then announced excitedly that he had found the truth.

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.879
Eventually, I was baptized in the 1950s.

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:52.579
My husband was favorable towards the truth,

00:05:52.579 --> 00:05:55.680
but got involved in political affairs in the community

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:59.779
and from there, he began his political career.

00:05:59.779 --> 00:06:02.480
When I read 1 Peter 3.1 and 2,

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:06.279
I understood that I needed to be in subjection to my husband

00:06:06.279 --> 00:06:08.879
with the hope that he could be won over without a word

00:06:08.879 --> 00:06:11.279
by means of my conduct.

00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:12.779
When my children were young,

00:06:12.779 --> 00:06:16.480
I made a weekly Bible study program for each of them.

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:18.680
And as they grew up, the older kids helped me

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.480
with their younger siblings.

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:22.480
I remember, Mom,

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:25.680
always made an effort to teach me how to preach.

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:28.079
I would write presentations for the ministry

00:06:28.079 --> 00:06:29.980
on pieces of paper,

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:31.279
and the kids would practice

00:06:31.279 --> 00:06:34.180
while they did their chores around the house.

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:38.379
We set aside time one day a week for our family study.

00:06:38.379 --> 00:06:40.980
You could be anything, a sack of potatoes,

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:43.279
a sack of flour, or a house plant.

00:06:43.279 --> 00:06:44.279
She would tell me,

00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:47.680
imagine that this is a person you meet and feel serious.

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:49.279
What would you say to them?

00:06:49.279 --> 00:06:51.379
When I finished, she would say to me,

00:06:51.379 --> 00:06:53.079
the way you did it just now,

00:06:53.079 --> 00:06:56.279
do it like that when you go out in the ministry.

00:06:56.279 --> 00:07:00.980
My mom was very creative.

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:06.519
She would assign us to play the part of different Bible characters.

00:07:07.519 --> 00:07:13.519
My mom taught us to appreciate the truth through her example.

00:07:13.519 --> 00:07:16.920
I served as a regular pioneer for many years,

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:20.920
and I encouraged my kids to reach out for spiritual goals.

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:23.220
My daughter left home at the age of 18

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:25.819
to serve as a special pioneer.

00:07:25.819 --> 00:07:28.519
Later, my oldest son did the same.

00:07:28.519 --> 00:07:31.019
These two proved to be excellent examples

00:07:31.019 --> 00:07:34.220
for their younger brothers.

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:37.220
Raising my son, Noe, was a challenge.

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:39.720
He was the youngest and at a very young age,

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:42.920
he was diagnosed with epilepsy.

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:45.120
Despite his limitations,

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:47.920
he was able to serve as a ministerial servant

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:50.420
and regular pioneer.

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:53.420
He fought his illness for more than 40 years

00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:57.560
before passing away recently.

00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:02.160
Losing my husband and death dealt me another blow.

00:08:02.259 --> 00:08:05.860
Now, my health and my memory are fading.

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:09.060
I can't do as much in the ministry as before.

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:12.060
But even so, thanks to the help of the brothers

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:17.939
and the congregation, I'm not giving up.

00:08:17.939 --> 00:08:20.540
Even though my husband was not a witness,

00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:24.139
I respected him as the head of the family.

00:08:24.139 --> 00:08:26.139
I will never forget the moment

00:08:26.139 --> 00:08:29.740
when my husband asked me to study the Bible with him.

00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:33.240
I remember that my eldest son gave the talk

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:37.340
and his father was among the candidates for baptism.

00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:40.740
42 years after I received the kingdom message,

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:43.340
my husband was baptized.

00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:47.440
Another great blessing was seeing my children grow in the truth

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:51.139
and use their youth to serve Jehovah.

00:08:51.139 --> 00:08:53.940
Some have served as special pioneers,

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:57.740
circuit overseers, or in Bethel.

00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:01.539
If it wasn't for her help and the support of my siblings,

00:09:01.539 --> 00:09:05.740
perhaps we wouldn't be part of the organization today.

00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:12.740
But thanks to her, we started out on the best course in life.

00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:17.539
Words cannot express how grateful I am to her.

00:09:17.539 --> 00:09:20.840
I now find great joy in seeing my grandchildren

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:25.139
and great-grandchildren follow their parents example.

00:09:25.139 --> 00:09:27.240
Thinking about all I have experienced

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:30.139
in over 60 years of service to Jehovah,

00:09:30.139 --> 00:09:32.840
raising my 10 children in the truth,

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:35.539
my husband becoming a servant of Jehovah

00:09:35.539 --> 00:09:39.639
and seeing 30 members of my family and full-time service.

00:09:39.639 --> 00:09:44.139
I can do nothing but thank Jehovah for his blessings.

00:09:44.139 --> 00:09:55.960
It's been worth all the effort.

00:09:55.960 --> 00:10:02.559
Sister Reyes continues to serve Jehovah faithfully at 86 years of age.

00:10:02.559 --> 00:10:07.559
Have you personally experienced some of her more difficult struggles?

00:10:07.559 --> 00:10:13.159
She's felt the heartbreak of losing her husband and child in death.

00:10:13.159 --> 00:10:16.059
In recent years, she's battled failing hell.

00:10:16.059 --> 00:10:18.259
But through all of that,

00:10:18.259 --> 00:10:23.659
Sister Reyes remains a motivating example for Christian women.

00:10:23.659 --> 00:10:28.259
Her story is an excellent start to our discussion.

00:10:28.259 --> 00:10:33.960
The theme for our program is The Women Proclaiming the Good News.

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:36.860
Sadly, throughout human history,

00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:42.259
women have been subjected to injustice, violence, and abuse.

00:10:42.259 --> 00:10:44.259
Why is that?

00:10:44.259 --> 00:10:46.860
The Bible explains.

00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:52.259
In the latter part of Genesis 3 and verse 16,

00:10:52.259 --> 00:10:55.259
notice what God says.

00:10:55.259 --> 00:11:02.299
Your longing will be for your husband and he will dominate you.

00:11:02.299 --> 00:11:06.799
When God said that Adam would dominate his wife,

00:11:06.899 --> 00:11:11.899
God was not indicating his approval of the subjugation of women by man.

00:11:11.899 --> 00:11:17.799
He was simply for telling the sad consequences of sin on the first couple.

00:11:17.799 --> 00:11:24.100
So abuse of women is a direct outcome of a sinful nature of humans,

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:26.799
not of God's will.

00:11:26.799 --> 00:11:28.700
Right down to our day,

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:34.600
rarely have women been accorded the dignity that God wants them to receive.

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:39.399
However, Jehovah makes clear in his word the Bible

00:11:39.399 --> 00:11:43.200
that women and men have equal standing before him.

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:44.600
In fact,

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:50.899
he indicated that women would play a vital role in the outworking of his purpose.

00:11:50.899 --> 00:11:57.000
Our theme is based on Psalm 68 and verse 11.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.200
Let's read it.

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:01.899
Jehovah gives the command.

00:12:01.899 --> 00:12:06.399
The women proclaiming the good news are a large army.

00:12:06.399 --> 00:12:08.399
Those words were inspired by God,

00:12:08.399 --> 00:12:13.549
but what did the Psalmist have in mind when he pinned them?

00:12:13.549 --> 00:12:21.950
The context of Psalm 68 shows that David was praising Jehovah as a God of saving acts.

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:24.850
From the time of their Exodus from Egypt,

00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:29.149
the men of Israel often had to fight against enemy nations.

00:12:29.149 --> 00:12:31.149
With Jehovah's help,

00:12:31.149 --> 00:12:32.649
they defeated them.

00:12:32.649 --> 00:12:38.450
And the entire nation would then rejoice over the victory Jehovah had given them.

00:12:38.450 --> 00:12:42.450
The first of the victory celebrations recorded in the Bible

00:12:42.450 --> 00:12:46.450
was at the time that Jehovah gave his people the victory over Pharaoh

00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:49.649
and the Egyptians who were pursuing them.

00:12:49.649 --> 00:12:55.350
Exodus chapter 15 verses 20 and 21

00:12:55.350 --> 00:13:00.049
tells what happened after this miraculous victory.

00:13:00.049 --> 00:13:03.950
Then Miriam, the prophetess, Aaron's sister,

00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:06.149
took a tambourine in her hand,

00:13:06.149 --> 00:13:10.950
and all the women followed her with tambourines and with dances.

00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:14.149
Miriam sang in response to the men,

00:13:14.149 --> 00:13:16.149
saying to Jehovah,

00:13:16.149 --> 00:13:19.649
for he has become highly exalted.

00:13:19.649 --> 00:13:24.250
The horse and its rider he has hurled into the sea.

00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:26.549
Picture that scene.

00:13:26.549 --> 00:13:30.950
There were an estimated three million people in the nation of Israel.

00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:32.549
Imagine,

00:13:32.549 --> 00:13:34.750
out of that large number,

00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:39.049
all the women were dancing and singing praises to Jehovah.

00:13:39.049 --> 00:13:43.450
That was undoubtedly a large army.

00:13:43.450 --> 00:13:48.549
What a great shout of praise to Jehovah that was.

00:13:48.549 --> 00:13:52.750
Another example was when King Saul and his general David returned from victory

00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:55.350
over the Philistines.

00:13:55.350 --> 00:14:03.549
Let's read the account at 1 Samuel chapter 18 and verse 6.

00:14:03.549 --> 00:14:07.850
When David and the others would return from striking down the Philistines,

00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:12.350
the women would come out from all the cities of Israel with song and dances

00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:15.750
to meet King Saul with tambourines,

00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:19.149
with rejoicing and with lutes.

00:14:19.149 --> 00:14:24.350
Notice that the account says that the women came out of all the cities

00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:28.850
to greet them with music, song and dance.

00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:34.250
Occasions such as these were not simply expressions of rejoicing

00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:37.450
that originated with human emotion.

00:14:37.450 --> 00:14:40.250
Recall that under inspiration, David said,

00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:43.350
Jehovah gives the command.

00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:46.149
The women proclaiming the good news are a large army.

00:14:46.149 --> 00:14:49.649
Yes, and Jehovah value their expressions of praise

00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:55.250
just as they value the contributions of the men who had engaged in battle.

00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:57.850
What about today?

00:14:57.850 --> 00:15:02.250
The report for the 2017 service year

00:15:02.250 --> 00:15:06.049
shows that there were over 8.3 million publishers

00:15:06.049 --> 00:15:10.049
proclaiming the good news throughout the earth.

00:15:10.049 --> 00:15:12.850
Keep in mind that in most lands,

00:15:12.850 --> 00:15:18.450
it is not unusual for our dear sisters to make up over half of our special pioneers

00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:23.549
and nearly three quarters of those who serve in the regular pioneer work.

00:15:23.549 --> 00:15:29.350
In addition, many other sisters are wholeheartedly spreading the good news of the kingdom

00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:33.649
to the best of their ability within their circumstances.

00:15:33.649 --> 00:15:35.950
There are many single parent families

00:15:35.950 --> 00:15:42.250
where our sisters are providing materially and spiritually for their children.

00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:47.149
Many of our faithful single sisters are expending themselves in Jehovah's service

00:15:47.149 --> 00:15:50.750
in theocratic construction and maintenance work,

00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:54.549
Bethel service, and serving where the need is greater,

00:15:54.549 --> 00:15:59.049
which includes serving in foreign language fields.

00:15:59.049 --> 00:16:02.850
Faithful wives loyalty support their husbands

00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:06.649
as well as fulfill their own roles as preachers and teachers.

00:16:06.649 --> 00:16:13.450
Yes, how Jehovah must be pleased to see all of you who serve in various ways.

00:16:13.549 --> 00:16:17.049
And we're grateful for the warm spirit

00:16:17.049 --> 00:16:22.750
and positive influence our dear sisters have on our congregations.

00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:30.149
Clearly, Jehovah values this large army of sisters.

00:16:30.149 --> 00:16:33.049
But I see take note of the individual circumstances

00:16:33.049 --> 00:16:36.549
and sacrifices of each sister.

00:16:36.549 --> 00:16:39.049
We do not have to wonder.

00:16:39.049 --> 00:16:47.649
By means of his word, Jehovah makes it evident that he sees and appreciates each of his servants.

00:16:47.649 --> 00:16:53.149
For example, did you notice when we read the scripture in Exodus chapter 15

00:16:53.149 --> 00:16:58.250
that Miriam was described as a prophetess?

00:16:58.250 --> 00:17:04.049
Evidently, she was privileged to be used as an instrument of divine communication.

00:17:04.049 --> 00:17:07.750
In some instances, this no doubt included singing songs

00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:10.950
that were inspired by Jehovah.

00:17:10.950 --> 00:17:15.849
Miriam was not the only one in the scriptures with this designation.

00:17:15.849 --> 00:17:21.250
Other women in the Bible records, such as Anna and Isaiah's wife,

00:17:21.250 --> 00:17:25.349
were also spoken of as prophetesses.

00:17:25.349 --> 00:17:32.349
In the book of Judges, another faithful servant, Deborah, is identified.

00:17:32.349 --> 00:17:39.849
Let's read Judges chapter 4 verses 4 and 5.

00:17:39.849 --> 00:17:46.450
Now, Deborah, a prophetess, a wife of Lapidoth, was judging Israel at that time.

00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:50.849
She used to sit under Deborah's palm tree between Rayma and Bethel

00:17:50.849 --> 00:17:53.250
in the mountainous region of Ephraim.

00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:56.650
The Israelites would go up to her for judgment.

00:17:56.650 --> 00:18:00.349
Evidently, Deborah was assigned a subtle disputes

00:18:00.349 --> 00:18:06.730
that arose among Israelites by giving Jehovah's answer to problems that came up.

00:18:06.730 --> 00:18:12.329
Much later in Israel's history, during the reign of faithful King Josiah,

00:18:12.329 --> 00:18:15.730
Haldah served as a prophetess.

00:18:15.730 --> 00:18:21.529
At 2 Kings chapter 22 and verse 8,

00:18:21.529 --> 00:18:28.029
we read that while the temple was being repaired, the original book of the law was found.

00:18:28.029 --> 00:18:36.430
When it was read to Josiah, he was distraught at seeing how far off the nation had strayed from Jehovah's law.

00:18:36.430 --> 00:18:45.029
At verse 13, he directed the priest, the secretary, and other influential men.

00:18:45.029 --> 00:18:52.029
Go, inquire of Jehovah in my behalf, in behalf of the people,

00:18:52.029 --> 00:18:58.529
and at behalf of all Judah concerning the words of this book that has been found.

00:18:58.529 --> 00:19:01.029
How did they accomplish this?

00:19:01.029 --> 00:19:03.730
Verse 14 continues,

00:19:03.730 --> 00:19:14.230
So, he'll cia the priest, a hikeum, acbor, shafen, and asiah, went to Haldah the prophetess.

00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:19.029
It's interesting that Jehovah used this faithful woman to convey his direction

00:19:19.029 --> 00:19:26.009
and that prominent men in priests sought her divinely inspired advice.

00:19:26.009 --> 00:19:32.509
The Christian Greek scriptures, however, do not permit sisters to serve in such a capacity as did Deborah

00:19:32.509 --> 00:19:36.509
and other prophetesses in the nation of Israel.

00:19:36.509 --> 00:19:47.809
However, Titus chapter 2 verses 3 and 4 encourages older women to display spiritual qualities

00:19:47.809 --> 00:19:52.009
so that they may advise the younger women in spiritual matters.

00:19:52.009 --> 00:19:55.309
Let's read those verses.

00:19:55.309 --> 00:20:01.509
Likewise, let the older women be reverent in behavior, not slanders,

00:20:01.509 --> 00:20:08.509
not enslaved to a lot of wine, teachers of what is good, so that they may advise the younger women

00:20:08.509 --> 00:20:12.509
to love their husbands, to love their children.

00:20:12.509 --> 00:20:16.509
How we appreciate the spiritually mature sisters among us

00:20:16.509 --> 00:20:23.509
who provide such fine assistance to younger sisters or those who are newer in the truth.

00:20:23.509 --> 00:20:28.509
However, today, Jehovah has delegated authority to men.

00:20:29.009 --> 00:20:38.509
They scripturally qualify to serve as elders and ministerial servants in order to serve, guide, and protect his people.

00:20:38.509 --> 00:20:44.509
It is obvious that this is not due to a lack of respect for the gifts of our sisters in the congregation.

00:20:44.509 --> 00:20:50.509
In fact, many responsible brothers will acknowledge that they have benefited from the experience

00:20:50.509 --> 00:20:56.509
and practical wisdom of our humble spiritually mature sisters.

00:20:56.509 --> 00:21:05.509
Finally, think of the outstanding faith of another woman mentioned in the Bible, Mary.

00:21:05.509 --> 00:21:15.509
What an awesome responsibility Jehovah entrusted her with, Mary, and raising his own son as a human.

00:21:15.509 --> 00:21:22.509
We can only imagine the thoughts that were going through her mind when she was told of this assignment.

00:21:22.509 --> 00:21:31.509
But the account in Luke, chapter 1, tells us much about her spirituality.

00:21:31.509 --> 00:21:42.509
In verse 38, after the angel Gabriel finished speaking with her, Mary's response was simply,

00:21:43.509 --> 00:21:51.509
Look, Jehovah's slave girl may it happen to me according to your declaration.

00:21:51.509 --> 00:21:58.509
She must have wondered how Jehovah would accomplish these things, but she was humble and obedient.

00:21:58.509 --> 00:22:04.509
Faithful men such as Moses and Jeremiah hesitated when given a challenging assignment from God.

00:22:04.509 --> 00:22:11.759
Not Mary. What a beautiful example she set for all of us, men and women.

00:22:11.759 --> 00:22:16.759
Clearly, Jehovah has always highly valued women.

00:22:16.759 --> 00:22:22.759
And we are privileged to serve today with millions of hardworking sisters.

00:22:22.759 --> 00:22:30.759
How pleased Jehovah must be to see dear sisters serving him humbly and faithfully.

00:22:30.759 --> 00:22:39.759
We urge you sisters, please keep up your good work and continue to be a positive influence in the congregation.

00:22:39.759 --> 00:22:46.759
God has indeed granted you faithful women the privilege of participating in the fulfillment of the psalmist words.

00:22:46.759 --> 00:22:55.579
Jehovah gives the command, the women proclaiming the good news are a large army.

00:22:55.579 --> 00:23:00.579
Thousands of our sisters have been active for many years in that large army of women.

00:23:01.579 --> 00:23:10.579
Bertil Coppelian, a special pioneer in West Virginia in the United States, entered the full-time service in 1958.

00:23:10.579 --> 00:23:15.579
In that time, she has helped more than 60 people to baptism.

00:23:15.579 --> 00:23:22.579
How has her outlook toward the ministry kept her going for almost 60 years?

00:23:22.579 --> 00:23:39.119
My father was opposed to the truth as I was growing up, but my mother was very, very zealous.

00:23:39.119 --> 00:23:43.119
I knew that things my mother was teaching me was the truth.

00:23:43.119 --> 00:23:47.119
I knew that this was what I was going to do.

00:23:47.119 --> 00:23:52.119
And it was not easy, but we did it.

00:23:52.119 --> 00:24:01.119
I was daddy's girl, but my mom made sure that I and my siblings knew the truth.

00:24:01.119 --> 00:24:09.119
She studied with us when no other children in the congregation had Bible studies at home.

00:24:09.119 --> 00:24:16.119
Of course, we kind of kicked and didn't like it, but it was glad she did it.

00:24:17.119 --> 00:24:21.119
My mother was a very, very positive person.

00:24:21.119 --> 00:24:29.119
And although she had the opposition, I saw how she dealt with it and how firm and determined she was.

00:24:29.119 --> 00:24:33.359
That was something she taught us.

00:24:33.359 --> 00:24:36.359
It's a mindset.

00:24:36.359 --> 00:24:39.359
You know, your mind is a wonderful thing.

00:24:39.359 --> 00:24:44.359
It can really influence you toward good, or maybe not so good.

00:24:44.359 --> 00:24:53.359
And so then I was determined in my mind that I was going to serve job of them.

00:24:53.359 --> 00:24:57.359
In our congregation, there were brothers and sisters of the anointed.

00:24:57.359 --> 00:25:03.359
They were always very kind to me, and they encouraged me.

00:25:03.359 --> 00:25:09.359
I worked in service with them, and I thought, that's the way I want to be.

00:25:09.359 --> 00:25:13.710
Children like attention.

00:25:13.710 --> 00:25:20.710
And so then if you give them attention, you talk with them and ask if you could work with them in the ministry.

00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:25.710
Then help them prepare a presentation and go over it and over it.

00:25:25.710 --> 00:25:31.710
And so that they're ready for the ministry, and then they'll enjoy it more.

00:25:31.710 --> 00:25:36.710
That was one of the things that the anointed in the congregation where I was.

00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:43.970
They paid attention to me, and I loved it.

00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:49.970
How I learned to teach was I think about the person, and I think about their situation.

00:25:49.970 --> 00:25:53.970
And I try to think in my mind what they are thinking.

00:25:53.970 --> 00:26:01.970
And I work on that and think of what kind of scriptures I could find to help them.

00:26:01.970 --> 00:26:10.970
And so then I try to pattern our studies to incorporate some of those things.

00:26:10.970 --> 00:26:16.950
Here's always challenges.

00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:21.950
Some of the winters right on the lake where I lived were very harsh.

00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:31.950
And my trailer was parked in such a way that every time the wind blew and the snow came and the ice came, it sealed the door.

00:26:31.950 --> 00:26:41.950
And so then I carried a big knife in my car, and I would have to cut around the door to get the door to open, break the ice seal.

00:26:41.950 --> 00:26:45.390
It was interesting.

00:26:45.390 --> 00:26:50.390
I had some opposition in the territories, and one was this lady was very irate.

00:26:50.390 --> 00:26:54.390
And she went to kick me, and she kicked me right in the stomach.

00:26:54.390 --> 00:26:57.390
And so then anyway, I dismissed myself.

00:26:57.390 --> 00:27:01.390
Then, a while later, it was time to work the territory again.

00:27:01.390 --> 00:27:04.390
Nobody wanted to go there, and we didn't have do-not-calls.

00:27:04.390 --> 00:27:08.390
I don't think at that time, at least there wasn't any in the territory.

00:27:08.390 --> 00:27:13.390
So then anyway, I called by, and I mentioned to her, oh, hello there.

00:27:13.390 --> 00:27:17.390
I know I've had the opportunity to talk with you before.

00:27:17.390 --> 00:27:18.390
Yes, she remembered.

00:27:18.390 --> 00:27:24.529
And I said, well, perhaps we were having a bad day then.

00:27:24.529 --> 00:27:31.529
I hit a low where I had a few Bible studies, and I prayed diligently to Jehovah.

00:27:31.529 --> 00:27:36.529
Jehovah helped me, I need Bible studies, and then you have to be out there looking for them.

00:27:36.529 --> 00:27:43.529
And well, I've lost my father, my mother, my sister, my brother.

00:27:43.529 --> 00:27:52.529
Well, naturally you feel at a loss, but Jehovah strengthened me, and the friends strengthened me.

00:27:52.529 --> 00:27:55.529
I kept busy in the ministry.

00:27:55.529 --> 00:28:00.529
But again, it goes back to that mindset, are you going to let the challenge beat you,

00:28:00.529 --> 00:28:02.529
or are you going to beat the challenge?

00:28:02.529 --> 00:28:08.509
You and Jehovah can beat the challenge.

00:28:08.509 --> 00:28:12.509
You know, discouragement is one of Satan's biggest tools.

00:28:12.509 --> 00:28:18.509
I always tell myself, I'm not going to let Satan beat me down.

00:28:18.509 --> 00:28:23.509
As far as health is concerned, my everyday health is very good.

00:28:23.509 --> 00:28:26.509
And I have a leg that drives me crazy.

00:28:26.509 --> 00:28:37.920
I think back of Jacob, he serves Jehovah with a limp, and then I think of Paul.

00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:42.609
And so then those things keep you humble.

00:28:42.609 --> 00:28:51.079
I've prayed and prayed and prayed about it, but just like with the Apostle Paul, it didn't disappear.

00:28:51.079 --> 00:28:55.079
And so then I just say, patch me up till I'm again.

00:28:55.079 --> 00:28:57.079
It'll disappear then.

00:28:57.079 --> 00:29:02.079
If your mind is made up, that this is what you're going to do, this is your life,

00:29:02.079 --> 00:29:05.079
this is what Jehovah wanted you to do.

00:29:05.079 --> 00:29:07.079
And so then you do it.

00:29:07.079 --> 00:29:13.390
I've seen how he's kept me going.

00:29:13.390 --> 00:29:21.799
You know that I've needed work, I've needed money, I've needed strength,

00:29:21.799 --> 00:29:27.799
I've needed companionship because a lot of times I'm in the ministry by myself, I talk to Jehovah.

00:29:27.799 --> 00:29:31.799
And so then he's always there for me.

00:29:31.799 --> 00:29:37.799
I definitely want to keep pioneering or serving Jehovah the best I can.

00:29:37.799 --> 00:29:50.799
Regardless of what comes up, there is nothing more joyful than to see that you have helped somebody live forever.

00:29:50.799 --> 00:30:00.000
Well, how much better could it be?

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:05.000
Sister Caperian had a profound effect on those she witnessed too.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:11.000
I know this because she found me in the door-to-door ministry when I was 14 years old.

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:15.000
At that age, I had the goal to be a doctor.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.000
One night after the meeting, Bertiel said to me,

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:24.000
well, you know, in the new world we won't need doctors because Jesus will do all the healing.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:32.000
Honestly, that hit me hard because I wanted to help people as well as provide for my mother.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:37.000
But she added what we will need is teachers.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.000
I thought that was a good idea.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:45.000
Still focused on a career, I had one type of teacher in mind, but she had another.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:52.000
Through her patience and reasoning, she helped me to become the most important kind of teacher,

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:55.000
a teacher of God's word.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:00.000
Is there someone like Sister Caperian in your congregation?

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:07.000
We are grateful for these sisters, zealous spirit, and for the personal interests they show toward us.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:10.000
And we're sure Jehovah values them like we do.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:16.279
One of Sister Caperian's strengths is her perseverance.

00:31:16.279 --> 00:31:26.279
Perseverance means to continue resolutely in the face of adversity, being tenacious, not giving up.

00:31:26.279 --> 00:31:34.279
If not careful, we could reach a spiritual goal only to let something distract us away from it.

00:31:34.279 --> 00:31:39.279
And this dramatization, a young sister is pioneering and working toward new goals.

00:31:39.279 --> 00:31:53.359
How though is she in danger of losing her focus?

00:31:53.359 --> 00:31:58.359
When I started learning sign language, it just seemed to come natural for me.

00:31:58.359 --> 00:32:11.559
After I transferred to the congregation, I remember feeling so happy.

00:32:11.559 --> 00:32:26.250
I was pioneering and really enjoying this new way of communicating.

00:32:26.250 --> 00:32:36.380
It's funny how the thing you love can also be the thing that tests you.

00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:42.710
Soon I took the test for a sign language interpreter.

00:32:42.710 --> 00:32:45.710
I couldn't believe I passed.

00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:51.069
I loved my new job.

00:32:51.069 --> 00:32:57.400
My hope was that it would support my pioneering.

00:32:57.400 --> 00:33:04.400
And maybe allow me to travel one day to a country and preach where there was a need for sign language.

00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:09.099
My boss was very happy with my work.

00:33:09.099 --> 00:33:12.099
So much so that he began to give me more.

00:33:12.099 --> 00:33:21.599
Everyone seemed appreciative.

00:33:21.599 --> 00:33:23.599
And the extra money didn't hurt.

00:33:23.599 --> 00:33:40.730
It was handling it all fine.

00:33:40.730 --> 00:33:45.200
Okay, for a while.

00:33:45.200 --> 00:34:34.110
My boss asked me to work full time for a few months to get some extra training.

00:34:34.110 --> 00:34:45.309
The race could help me with planning my trip abroad.

00:34:45.309 --> 00:34:48.309
I knew my parents would be concerned.

00:34:48.309 --> 00:34:52.619
I knew because I felt it too.

00:34:52.619 --> 00:34:55.619
I was already dragging physically.

00:34:55.619 --> 00:34:59.619
But then again, it would only be for a few months.

00:34:59.619 --> 00:35:02.619
I was really torn.

00:35:02.619 --> 00:35:07.619
Dad kindly commended me for having good goals and trying my best to work toward them.

00:35:07.619 --> 00:35:12.619
Then he showed me a scripture that really helped me.

00:35:12.619 --> 00:35:15.619
First Timothy 416.

00:35:15.619 --> 00:35:19.619
Pay constant attention to yourself and to your teaching.

00:35:19.619 --> 00:35:22.619
Persevere in these things.

00:35:22.619 --> 00:35:28.900
For by doing this, you will save both yourself and those who listen to you.

00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:35.559
He helped me to see that Timothy set spiritual goals for himself growing up.

00:35:35.559 --> 00:35:37.559
But Paul was now telling him,

00:35:37.559 --> 00:35:39.559
don't stop.

00:35:39.559 --> 00:35:44.360
Even though Timothy was a grown spiritual man,

00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:48.360
Paul encouraged him to continue setting new spiritual goals.

00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:57.079
In fact, to persevere in them was I persevering in.

00:35:57.079 --> 00:36:14.889
I kindly turned down the offer and explained to my boss that I'd like to keep my hours to a minimum.

00:36:14.889 --> 00:36:25.960
So I could support my number one job.

00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:30.820
Might take me longer to save my money,

00:36:30.820 --> 00:36:39.820
but I'll make that trip one day with Jehovah's help and a little perseverance.

00:36:39.820 --> 00:36:45.639
It's interesting that the skills he used to expand her ministry

00:36:45.639 --> 00:36:50.639
and support her pioneering became her distraction.

00:36:50.639 --> 00:36:53.639
That wasn't easy for her to see it first.

00:36:53.639 --> 00:36:56.639
Who helped her to see the problem clearly?

00:36:56.639 --> 00:37:02.639
It was her parents, especially her spiritually minded father.

00:37:02.639 --> 00:37:07.639
The interest you family had show in your daughters is well worth the effort.

00:37:07.639 --> 00:37:11.639
It can point them in the right direction when they need guidance.

00:37:11.639 --> 00:37:19.639
Everything you do for them shows how precious they are to you and to Jehovah.

00:37:19.639 --> 00:37:22.639
And that's the feeling expressed in the music video.

00:37:22.639 --> 00:37:48.099
Precious daughter.

00:41:13.889 --> 00:41:22.889
The Apostle John wrote that he had no greater joy than to hear that his spiritual children continued walking in the truth.

00:41:22.889 --> 00:41:30.170
You fathers feel that same joy when you see your daughters mature as Christian women.

00:41:30.170 --> 00:41:36.170
Raising your children to love Jehovah is just one of the many things you do for your family.

00:41:36.170 --> 00:41:44.170
At a Bethel morning worship, brother let focused on the special relationship between a husband and wife.

00:41:44.170 --> 00:41:49.170
What can a husband do to show that he shares Jehovah's view of his wife?

00:41:49.170 --> 00:41:58.170
My theme for this little discussion is husbands love your wife as yourself.

00:41:59.170 --> 00:42:03.170
What did Jesus say was the second greatest commandment?

00:42:03.170 --> 00:42:05.170
Well, you're familiar with it.

00:42:05.170 --> 00:42:13.170
In Matthew 22, 39, he said, you must love your neighbor as yourself.

00:42:13.170 --> 00:42:18.170
Now, what an excellent illustration is contained in this second greatest commandment.

00:42:18.170 --> 00:42:23.170
If you think about it, we just naturally inherently love ourselves, don't we?

00:42:23.170 --> 00:42:25.170
And we show that love in many ways.

00:42:25.170 --> 00:42:32.170
So Jesus is saying work hard to show the same love for others you show for yourself.

00:42:32.170 --> 00:42:39.170
But now thinking of husbands as addressed in our theme, who is a husband's closest neighbor?

00:42:39.170 --> 00:42:41.170
Well, his wife.

00:42:41.170 --> 00:42:50.170
So especially must the husband work hard to show the love he shows for himself just naturally to show that love for his wife.

00:42:50.170 --> 00:42:56.170
Now, what are some specific ways that husbands just naturally love themselves?

00:42:56.170 --> 00:42:58.170
Let's talk about five.

00:42:58.170 --> 00:43:03.170
And undoubtedly, you could think of many others that could be discussed during this discussion.

00:43:03.170 --> 00:43:08.170
But number one, a husband feeds himself.

00:43:08.170 --> 00:43:19.170
Ephesians 5 verse 29 says in part, for no man ever hated his own body, but he feeds it.

00:43:19.170 --> 00:43:23.170
Well, what does loving our wife now as ourself require?

00:43:23.170 --> 00:43:32.170
Well, for one thing, we certainly would make sure we provide the food and other material needs that our wife has.

00:43:32.170 --> 00:43:38.170
And regarding this, I think of our brothers in concentration camps in Nazi Germany.

00:43:38.170 --> 00:43:40.170
Food was very scarce.

00:43:41.170 --> 00:43:51.170
But our brothers even then from their meager food ration would share food with other brothers, even in some cases with worldly people.

00:43:51.170 --> 00:43:59.170
Well, similarly, a husband would do without himself, if necessary, in order to provide what his wife really needs.

00:43:59.170 --> 00:44:07.170
But even more importantly, in extended application, he would make sure that she is well fed spiritually.

00:44:07.170 --> 00:44:19.170
He must make sure that she has opportunity to benefit from periods of personal study, congregation meetings, assemblies, conventions, and family worship.

00:44:19.170 --> 00:44:24.170
But now let's talk about a second way that a husband just naturally loves himself.

00:44:24.170 --> 00:44:27.170
We cherish ourselves.

00:44:27.170 --> 00:44:37.170
Ephesians 529 says in part, for no man ever hated his own body, but he cherishes it.

00:44:37.170 --> 00:44:40.170
Now, what does cherish mean?

00:44:40.170 --> 00:44:46.170
Well, according to the dictionary, it means to treat with affection and tenderness.

00:44:46.170 --> 00:44:50.170
Treasure, value, attach importance to.

00:44:50.170 --> 00:44:58.170
See, because of this feeling we have toward ourselves, we try to get rest when we're sick or tired.

00:44:58.170 --> 00:45:01.170
We try to be with friends and loved ones.

00:45:01.170 --> 00:45:06.170
We play games, we exercise, we do things we enjoy periodically.

00:45:06.170 --> 00:45:08.170
We treat ourselves, don't we?

00:45:08.170 --> 00:45:11.170
Because we cherish ourselves.

00:45:11.170 --> 00:45:15.170
So, what does loving our wife as our self require?

00:45:15.170 --> 00:45:19.170
Well, certainly means more than just being able to put up with our mate.

00:45:19.170 --> 00:45:26.170
It means cherishing her, cultivating affection, fondness for her.

00:45:26.170 --> 00:45:28.170
I think of this.

00:45:28.170 --> 00:45:37.170
In Proverbs 831, it says that Jesus in His prehuman existence was fond of humans.

00:45:37.170 --> 00:45:47.170
Now, don't you think that fondness He had for us made it easier for him to come to the earth, take the difficult assignment He took, and even die for us because He was fond of us?

00:45:47.170 --> 00:46:02.170
Well, similarly, if wives are cherished by their husbands, if their husbands are fond of their wives, it'll make it so much easier to forgive them, to even die for them if necessary in the future.

00:46:02.170 --> 00:46:11.170
But if we're going to have this proper feeling like Jehovah, we have to focus on the good qualities of our wife.

00:46:11.170 --> 00:46:14.170
See, not the flaws, the imperfections.

00:46:14.170 --> 00:46:24.170
And as one of the brothers commented on, I love the thoughts in the Watchtower comments, love is best sensed when it is expressed.

00:46:24.170 --> 00:46:34.170
How vital that marriage mates not allow the activities of daily life to rob them of exchanging expressions of affection.

00:46:34.170 --> 00:46:39.170
And now let's get a third way that husbands just naturally love themselves.

00:46:39.170 --> 00:46:42.170
We adorn ourselves.

00:46:42.170 --> 00:46:51.170
First Timothy 2.9 speaks of women adorning themselves in appropriate dress. Well, husbands try to do the same thing.

00:46:51.170 --> 00:47:02.170
And in adorning ourselves, we try to cover over, minimize our flaws, cover our bulges, our blemishes.

00:47:02.170 --> 00:47:05.170
We try to make ourselves look as good as possible, don't we?

00:47:05.170 --> 00:47:13.170
Well, what does loving our wife as ourself require? For one thing, we certainly wouldn't shine a spotlight on her flaws.

00:47:13.170 --> 00:47:19.170
We wouldn't do this in the presence of others. We would try hard not to even do it in her own mind.

00:47:19.170 --> 00:47:32.170
Rather, we seek to cover over minor sins and transgressions as encouraged at Proverbs 1911, where it says it is beauty to overlook and offense.

00:47:32.170 --> 00:47:41.170
So we work hard to adorn our wives. Make her look as good as possible in the eyes of others, even in her own mind.

00:47:41.170 --> 00:47:46.170
Well, let's get a fourth way that husbands just naturally love themselves.

00:47:46.170 --> 00:47:51.170
We take steps to heal ourselves when we're sick or injured.

00:47:51.170 --> 00:48:02.170
Mark 526 talks about a woman who was very sick. She suffered at the hands of many physicians. She's been all her resources. She didn't eat better. She got worse.

00:48:02.170 --> 00:48:09.170
But the point is, she was really trying hard to heal herself. Well, husbands try to do the same thing.

00:48:09.170 --> 00:48:18.170
So if we're sick or injured, we try to get extra rest. We'll buy medicine. We'll take vitamins. We'll make an appointment with a doctor.

00:48:18.170 --> 00:48:27.170
We'll pursue therapy. See, we try to get well. What does loving our wife has our self required then?

00:48:27.170 --> 00:48:33.170
Well, we would certainly do all within our power if she's sick or injured. Try to help her get well.

00:48:33.170 --> 00:48:39.170
But even more importantly, if she happens to be ailing somewhat spiritually, we would do everything.

00:48:39.170 --> 00:48:46.170
We can possibly do to help her get well spiritually. What would be something perhaps we could do?

00:48:46.170 --> 00:48:55.170
Well, Proverbs 18 says the tongue of the wise is a healing. So the using of wise expressions.

00:48:55.170 --> 00:49:05.170
Also, Proverbs 1624, pleasant sayings are a honeycomb, sweet to the soul, and a healing to the bones.

00:49:05.170 --> 00:49:11.170
So pleasant sayings, we would use these to try to help her get well spiritually.

00:49:12.170 --> 00:49:17.170
But now here's one more of fifth way that husbands just naturally love themselves.

00:49:17.170 --> 00:49:22.170
We make allowances excuses if we make mistakes.

00:49:22.170 --> 00:49:32.170
Husbands who make mistakes are often heard blaming it on their heredity or maybe the environment.

00:49:32.170 --> 00:49:39.480
Their blood sugar level. How much sleep they got or didn't get the night before.

00:49:39.480 --> 00:49:42.480
The weather and so forth.

00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:48.480
We tend to well understand our own limitations, don't we? And we allow for that.

00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:53.480
Well, what about loving our wife as herself? We'd make the same allowances for her.

00:49:53.480 --> 00:49:59.480
Being positive, imputing good motives to her. If she speaks a little roughly,

00:49:59.480 --> 00:50:07.480
absolutely thoughtlessly, we'll try to discern the feelings behind the words or actions.

00:50:07.480 --> 00:50:14.480
We'll make allowances, especially if we can discern that she's under some kind of emotional pressure.

00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:18.480
We'll make that allowance for her like we would for ourselves.

00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:22.480
Well, there we have five ways that husbands show love for ourselves.

00:50:23.480 --> 00:50:29.480
We feed, cherish, adorn, try to heal ourselves.

00:50:29.480 --> 00:50:34.480
And we make allowances excuses when we make mistakes.

00:50:34.480 --> 00:50:43.480
Let's work hard to show the same love, those five areas for our dear beloved wives.

00:50:43.480 --> 00:50:48.480
And I'm sure as we said, you can think of other ways that husbands just naturally love themselves.

00:50:49.480 --> 00:50:51.480
But what a rich illustration Jesus gave.

00:50:51.480 --> 00:50:55.480
And interestingly, he took it even a step further.

00:50:55.480 --> 00:51:00.480
He further expanded the illustration in John 13 and verse 34.

00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:02.480
You're familiar with this.

00:51:02.480 --> 00:51:12.480
1334, he said, I'm giving you a new commandment that you love one another just as I have loved you.

00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:15.480
You also love one another.

00:51:15.480 --> 00:51:23.480
So he's saying that we should even have deeper love for our brothers, which would definitely include our Christian wives,

00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:26.480
deeper love than we have for ourselves.

00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:35.480
And that deeper love would move us to treat our dear wives even better than we treat ourselves.

00:51:36.480 --> 00:51:42.480
Husbands, we know your wife will never grow tired of your efforts to apply that counsel.

00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:51.480
Really, the whole family benefits when each member loves their closest neighbors as themselves.

00:51:51.480 --> 00:51:57.480
And when a family is happy and spiritually strong, they can do so much for Jehovah.

00:51:58.480 --> 00:52:09.480
At the Scandinavia branch, families from 19 congregations in Denmark, Norway and Sweden participated in children's courses to record theocratic music.

00:52:09.480 --> 00:52:16.480
The children worked hard to prepare for each session, but that meant hard work for the parents too.

00:52:16.480 --> 00:52:27.630
The results, however, are a course of praise to Jehovah.

00:52:28.630 --> 00:52:32.630
You get so happy when you sing with others.

00:52:32.630 --> 00:52:40.360
Jehovah created us like that.

00:52:40.360 --> 00:52:42.360
The birds also sing.

00:52:42.360 --> 00:52:45.360
I feel that Jehovah is proud of me.

00:52:45.360 --> 00:52:53.360
The Scandinavia branch offers 9 languages in audio and video production.

00:52:53.360 --> 00:53:06.360
In the three largest languages, Swedish, Norwegian and Danish, there are also three children courses that help us with the recordings of the songs for the become Jehovah's Friend series.

00:53:06.360 --> 00:53:12.360
First, I listen very carefully to the American adult chorus.

00:53:12.360 --> 00:53:20.360
I try to spot where they breathe, where they pause, and the overall mood in their way of singing.

00:53:20.360 --> 00:53:23.360
Then, I listen to the music we have received.

00:53:26.360 --> 00:53:36.360
I have a piano at home to practice the voices and figure out where the high notes and low notes are, where the challenging parts are, and how I can pass this on to the children.

00:53:36.360 --> 00:53:47.360
I also think about what the goal with the recording is, how other children who listen to the song can feel the same joy as we feel when we are singing and recording it.

00:53:50.360 --> 00:53:59.360
Before the children arrive, we make sure that all the equipment is prepared and tested, so everything is ready when they come here.

00:53:59.360 --> 00:54:13.360
When we receive the assignment to participate in the recordings of a new song, I feel that our girls have been full of initiative to practice, and we have made it our custom to sing the songs and our family worship.

00:54:14.360 --> 00:54:22.360
When we are driving to the RTO for the recordings and on other occasions, we usually sing in the car.

00:54:22.360 --> 00:54:28.360
I like to sing the songs because they are good and have nice melodies.

00:54:31.360 --> 00:54:35.360
I especially like the new songs, because they are so different.

00:54:35.360 --> 00:54:42.360
One has African drums in it, and the next is a bit Irish, and like you are walking in a valley and on a mountain.

00:54:44.840 --> 00:54:51.840
Alma plays the cello, and has asked to get the sheet music for the new kingdom songs, which are her favorites right now.

00:54:52.840 --> 00:55:00.280
It's been a challenge for Andre and me, because we are not that musical.

00:55:00.280 --> 00:55:07.280
There is also a serious part, so we start with a prayer to Jehovah.

00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:17.280
Then we watch the video and talk about the point of the video, and how other children and families can benefit when listening to them.

00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:24.280
Then we need to loosen up a bit, so we warm up with some exercises, and then we are ready to sing.

00:55:52.269 --> 00:55:59.269
It is clear to us that they appreciate their privilege more and more. They actually see it as praise to Jehovah.

00:56:00.269 --> 00:56:06.269
The joy they have of singing for Jehovah rubs off and asks who work with them.

00:56:06.269 --> 00:56:16.550
When the children sing with joy and express themselves freely, it has an effect on us as parents and the ones in the congregation.

00:56:16.550 --> 00:56:24.550
Jehovah becomes happy when he sees it, and also when he brothers and sisters and children become happy.

00:56:25.550 --> 00:56:30.550
It is fun to make the recordings, you get so happy, and then it's more fun to sing at meetings.

00:56:34.309 --> 00:56:39.309
I see more clearly why we sing, and why it is a part of our worship.

00:56:41.309 --> 00:56:47.309
We don't go there just to spend time with our friends. We go there to sing. It is a part of praising Jehovah.

00:56:48.309 --> 00:56:50.309
Singing is like a prayer to him.

00:56:51.309 --> 00:56:59.309
I have been humming the songs, and people around me wonder what it is I am always humming, so it has helped me.

00:56:59.309 --> 00:57:02.309
And it is an easy way to give a witness.

00:57:02.309 --> 00:57:05.309
My faith in Jehovah is stronger now.

00:57:05.309 --> 00:57:07.309
Yes, it is a gap.

00:57:07.309 --> 00:57:11.309
I think that I am happier than Jehovah after I began singing.

00:57:11.309 --> 00:57:17.309
You understand that singing is a huge part of our worship, and Jehovah wants us to use it.

00:57:17.309 --> 00:57:27.440
When children sing out joyfully to Jehovah, they draw closer to him.

00:57:27.440 --> 00:57:32.440
The choruses in Scandinavia are a good example of that fact.

00:57:32.440 --> 00:57:38.440
Their excitement for singing even gave them opportunities to witness to their classmates.

00:57:38.440 --> 00:57:48.440
You probably already include singing as part of your family worship and agree that we feel a special warmth when the family sings to Jehovah together.

00:57:48.440 --> 00:57:58.880
As you look ahead at the August midweek meetings, you'll notice a part for the week of August 28 that asks,

00:57:58.880 --> 00:58:02.880
when can I next serve as an auxiliary pioneer?

00:58:02.880 --> 00:58:09.880
You'll want to prepare by watching the video with Jehovah, I can do almost anything.

00:58:09.880 --> 00:58:16.880
It's a live story of Sister Sabina Hernandez, which appeared in the December 2015 program.

00:58:16.880 --> 00:58:21.880
You'll find it in the video on demand section under interviews and experiences.

00:58:21.880 --> 00:58:28.880
At the midweek meeting, you'll be ready to share how Sabina's example encouraged you.

00:58:28.880 --> 00:58:38.880
Our program has shown us how much Jehovah values what women do in the family, in the congregation, and in the ministry.

00:58:38.880 --> 00:58:45.880
To all of our sisters, please be assured that we love you.

00:58:45.880 --> 00:58:50.880
And it's our prayer that Jehovah continues to bless your work.

00:58:50.880 --> 00:58:55.880
We want to conclude with greetings from our brothers and sisters on the island of Sipan.

00:58:55.880 --> 00:59:04.880
Part of Micronesia in the Western Pacific Ocean, Sipan is a popular destination for thousands of tourists.

00:59:04.880 --> 00:59:10.880
But make no mistake, this is a preacher's paradise.

00:59:10.880 --> 00:59:25.880
After early opposition to the preaching work, the truth is now flourishing with an average of 200 kingdom publishers in three congregations throughout the island, including 33 regular pioneers.

00:59:25.880 --> 00:59:34.880
The relaxing atmosphere and tropical climate make public witnessing cards an effective way to reach the hearts of receptive ones.

00:59:35.880 --> 00:59:47.880
The large numbers of tourists, many from Asian lands, are finding our literature in Japanese, Korean, Tagalog, Chinese, and other languages.

00:59:47.880 --> 00:59:54.880
Among the first baptized publishers in Sipan are faithful sisters who are now in their 80s.

00:59:54.880 --> 00:59:58.880
Sister Tyco Castro was baptized in 1970.

00:59:58.880 --> 01:00:02.880
And Tamasamoffness was baptized in 1973.

01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:10.880
They continue to be zealous kingdom proclaimers and are fine examples of the women proclaiming the good news.

01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:21.880
We send our love and greetings to these congregations in Sipan and warmly commend them for their positive spirit and hard work to make Jehovah's name known.

01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:29.880
Thank you for watching. From the World Headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses, this is JW Broadcasting.
