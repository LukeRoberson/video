00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:53.670
She said she had forgotten about our invitation.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:03.549
This wasn't the first time.

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:07.549
Why does she do this again and again?

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:14.549
I said in my heart that I could never forgive her.

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:21.370
Will you forgive her?

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:23.370
Of course I will.

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:27.370
A Christian usually knows the right thing to do.

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:32.370
But doing the right thing, that's different.

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:37.319
I found what I needed.

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:39.319
I knew I would forgive my sister,

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:43.319
but the article reminded me how to handle it.

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:45.319
Three points.

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:49.319
One, promptly.

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:51.319
I couldn't wait.

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:55.319
I needed to talk with her as soon as she could.

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:57.319
Two,

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:01.319
I shouldn't talk to others about it.

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:05.319
I must do it privately.

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:10.819
And three, peacefully.

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:12.819
Rather than accusing her,

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:15.819
I should simply express how I feel.

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:21.990
And I also need to listen patiently to my sister.

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:28.550
I needed to act right away.
