00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:14.699
What is there to look forward to?

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:21.129
I've been thinking about this for a while now.

00:00:21.129 --> 00:00:27.129
Recently, a huge typhoon hit our area and inflicted severe damage.

00:00:27.129 --> 00:00:37.750
Now, three generations of our family are temporarily living together in a small apartment.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:51.899
Somehow, our family is keeping up our spiritual routine.

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:58.899
But to be honest,

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:04.239
our hearts aren't really in it.

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:10.239
We lost some close friends, our house, and the car.

00:01:10.239 --> 00:01:21.049
From that day on, it's like we can't think or feel anything.

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:38.510
We are just going through the motions.

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:50.930
A brother from the disaster relief committee visited us.

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:56.930
He really listened to how we felt and gave us comfort from the Bible.

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:07.859
That evening, my son and I discussed how we can help our family.

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:17.659
We found a scripture at Jeremiah chapter 29 verse 11,

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:19.659
which says,

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:25.659
For I will know the thoughts that I'm thinking toward you, declares Jehovah.

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:30.659
Thoughts of peace and not of calamity.

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:34.659
To give you a future and a hope,

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:42.409
Jehovah is looking at our future and our hope.

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:45.409
Not just what we are facing now.

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:53.750
We thought about Moses' example.

00:02:53.750 --> 00:03:19.139
By faith, Moses looked intently toward the payment of the reward.

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:24.449
We finally saw what we should do.

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:57.580
The next day, we all tried to envision the future paradise.

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:01.580
We all felt a ray of hope into our hearts.

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:10.979
What is there to look forward to?

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:14.979
I've been thinking about it for a while now.

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:21.980
When we dwell on the disaster, what we lost and just what we see before our eyes,

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:27.980
then we can so easily be discouraged and lose joy.

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:32.980
But when we look toward the reward that Jehovah will give us

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:37.980
and the future that Jehovah has in store for us,

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.980
even in such hard times,

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.980
we can rejoice in the hope.

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:59.069
Know the answer.

00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:06.069
Yes, what I look forward to is our wonderful future.
