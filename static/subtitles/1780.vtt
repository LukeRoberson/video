00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:06.040
Proverbs 35 and 6 made a tremendous impression on me.

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:10.039
Trust in Jehovah with all your heart.

00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:13.039
When I was younger, I probably said,

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:16.039
All right, let me try it and see if it works.

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:19.039
As much as I loved what I was learning from Jehovah,

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:24.039
I was still leaning a lot of my own understanding.

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:27.039
Obviously, when we make decisions in our lives,

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:30.039
a spiritual person, they review and think,

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:32.039
Let's do this Jehovah's way.

00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:36.039
And that was something that I had lost sight of at that moment in my life.

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:44.009
There was considerable opposition to the work.

00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:48.009
We expected when we did street work.

00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:52.009
We might be picked up and taken a jail.

00:00:52.009 --> 00:00:59.009
But Jehovah's organization had explained to us how we were to hand-lit.

00:00:59.009 --> 00:01:03.009
I do remember when the police finally picked me up

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:05.010
and they drove me down to Chicago.

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.010
It was about an hour's drive.

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.010
And they asked me, So what did you do wrong?

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.010
So I had one hour to witness to them.

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:18.010
And as I recall, I kept track of it and I counted the time too.

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:24.010
Things didn't disturb us because we were being trained by Jehovah's organization.

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:27.010
We knew what to do.

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:31.010
So I ended up in a jail in Chicago for a weekend.

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:35.010
There was nothing I could do about it.

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:37.010
So I put up with them.

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:43.349
So I was home for a day or two and then I went back to my assignment and I kept on working.

00:01:43.349 --> 00:01:48.349
Left the rest in Jehovah's hands and they handled it very nicely.

00:01:48.349 --> 00:01:57.420
Whether we were in jail or whether we were not.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.420
Eventually, I stumbled upon the punk rock anarchist scene.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.420
And this really called out to me because here I can be myself.

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.419
I can establish my own standards.

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:18.419
But that scene eventually led me down to a very dark path of immorality, drug abuse, drunkenness, and a lot of violence.

00:02:18.419 --> 00:02:28.379
I felt lonely, I felt betrayed, I felt nothing made sense.

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:35.379
I remember thinking back on that when I was learning about Jehovah and how simple things were,

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:39.379
I decided to give Jehovah another shot.

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:46.379
Reading Matthew 1624 hit me really hard or where it says to disown yourself.

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:52.379
Because I knew that scripture but I still haven't really focused on what it meant for me.

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:59.379
I knew I had to let go of certain parts of my personality of my old lifestyle.

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:03.379
Never really given Jehovah a complete fair chance.

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:08.379
And so I started applying more fully to principles I found, so I trust in Jehovah more.

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:11.379
Very quickly things started falling into place.

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:17.379
The determination that I had to serve him, the changes that I needed to make, changes that I never thought I could.

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:29.469
I felt that spiritual progress was appointments and assignments.

00:03:29.469 --> 00:03:35.360
I think pride got the best of me there.

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:41.360
Very shortly after we got to the congregation in Brooklyn, I'm out in service with the coordinator.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:48.990
And he says to me, the letter came back and you weren't recommended as a servant.

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:51.990
Do you know what happened?

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:55.990
So I said, well, you know, I think those brothers have some problems over there.

00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:02.240
And he said, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, stop for a second here.

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:06.240
You don't need to tell me anything negative about the brothers in that hall.

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:12.240
Focus on what you need to do and Jehovah will take care of the rest of it.

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:16.240
It really did feel like Jehovah was just saying, okay, stop.

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:19.240
Right now you need to focus on you.

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:29.240
And that really just allowed me to relax and focus on what was really a lot more important than whether I had a certain position in Jehovah's organization.

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:38.240
The humility and the patience and the love and the adjustments that I needed to make being a more obedient servant of Jehovah.

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:45.240
Those were the things that were so important that I had forgotten about for a while.

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:51.240
All the time that I spent pursuing my own interests, it always led to disappointment.

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:59.240
And now that I've learned about Jehovah and living by his principles, I have been having the time of my life.

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:12.240
To know that Jehovah just simply wants to make me the best version of me and teach me to enhance my personality and to become better, that really endeared me to Jehovah.

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:19.240
Jehovah really cared about me enough to mold my thinking.

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:23.240
It was kind of like my life was back into focus.

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:28.240
And I was able to just relax and serve Jehovah happily.

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:33.240
And then of course the blessing started really pouring in after that.

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:40.240
Everything I've done connected with the truth, I have enjoyed every speck of it.

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:50.290
You might have some great idea, but I found out you do things Jehovah's way.

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:54.290
And the end result is nothing but good.
