00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:05.940
The Saul of Saddo.

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.939
That is what my husband was called.

00:00:08.939 --> 00:00:17.660
He seriously considered having all the witnesses expelled from this island.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.660
He was even planning to purchase an island and have them move there.

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:32.890
If he learned the witnesses were preaching in Saddo, he immediately set out to stop them

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.890
and possibly took our brother to the seashore.

00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:06.579
Even so, I never considered giving up.

00:01:06.579 --> 00:01:09.579
Eventually, he decided to divorce me.

00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:21.510
He told the children, choose who do you want to live with, your mother or me.

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:29.510
I gave our children whatever they wanted, but my wife gave them the rod of discipline.

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.510
They all made the same choice.

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:39.790
They chose me.

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:47.040
I was 100% sure that they would choose me, but they chose my wife.

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.040
They chose the rod over money.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.040
Why?

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.040
How come?

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.040
It was a mystery.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.040
So I didn't divorce her, but looked into the Bible instead.

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:07.540
He gradually made spiritual progress, joined the ministry school,

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.539
and received his first assignment.

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:17.169
But then he got a phone call from the Minister of Agriculture

00:02:17.169 --> 00:02:22.169
and was invited to come up to Congress to make a report.

00:02:22.169 --> 00:02:26.169
It was just on the day of his assignment.

00:02:26.169 --> 00:02:34.430
This is quite an honor, so I plan to give the report to the Congress priority

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.430
and refuse the assignment on the school.

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.430
But that morning, I found a letter on the shoebox.

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.960
It was from the children.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.960
It said, we are all looking forward to Daddy's talk.

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:59.879
I thought to myself, which is more valuable, giving a speech before Congress,

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:03.879
or a talk before my family who are looking forward to it so much,

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:11.210
I called the Minister and turned down his offer.

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:16.210
It ruined my relationship of cooperation with the politician.

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:25.590
But I thought that the bond with my family was more valuable.

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.590
When I think about it, it was a tireless love, care,

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:34.590
and respect my family showed that won me over.

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:41.590
Since I always came home late from work, my wife and children made message notebooks

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:51.669
in order to keep good communication with me to our kind daddy, welcome home.

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:56.669
Tomorrow you have to go far. It must be hard. Please take care.

00:03:56.669 --> 00:04:02.979
Our greatest hope is that you study the Bible soon.

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:11.210
They are so caring and affectionate.

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:15.210
I just did what I thought I ought to.

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:21.209
From the beginning, I was confident that my husband would become a Jehovah's Witness.

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:27.209
And Jehovah would never abandon such a pure and gentle man.

00:04:27.209 --> 00:04:36.670
Isn't it only natural that I would want to show love and respect to win over such a man?

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:50.980
Now, just as our children dreamed, we are praising Jehovah as a family.

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:54.980
And I am enjoying pioneering with my wife.

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:59.980
Our children have expanded their ministry to serve in countries where the need is greater.

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:12.490
We are enjoying Jehovah's blessings.

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:16.490
My husband was called the Saul of Sado.

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:22.490
But now, in this island where he tried to expel Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:28.490
he loves Christian friends and zealously preaches the Bible truth.

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:33.899
I am so thankful to Jehovah.

00:05:33.899 --> 00:05:38.899
The Saul of Sado has become a pioneer in Sado.
