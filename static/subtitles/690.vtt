00:00:11.859 --> 00:00:16.859
The Philippines' archipelago is composed of over 7,000 islands.

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:22.859
It spans an area of about 1,850 kilometers from north to south,

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.859
and some 1,125 kilometers from east to west.

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:33.859
In the large cities, people often crowd into jeepneys for public transportation.

00:00:33.859 --> 00:00:39.859
In the vast rural areas, farming and fishing are common occupations.

00:00:39.859 --> 00:00:42.859
Rice is normally served at every meal.

00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:44.859
Sea food too is very common,

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:50.859
along with vegetables and such unique fruits as mango steam, jackfruit and durian.

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:57.350
How has Jehovah's name been glorified in these islands?

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:05.980
In 1912, CT Russell stopped in Manila and gave a talk on the subject where are the dead?

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:14.900
The Watchtower reported that there were present about 1,000 Filipino young men ages from 18 to 30,

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.900
who understand English and who gave the very closest attention.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:25.900
Several decades later, in 1947, the first Gilead graduates arrived.

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:31.900
In 1954, Raymond Leach and Denton Hopkinson also arrived.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.900
Brother Hopkinson entered the circuit work at age 22,

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.900
and now serves on the branch committee.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:44.569
The number of publishers when I first arrived was 20,000 in the Philippines.

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:51.569
Now it's more than 240,000, so I would never have believed it at that time.

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:58.569
Brother Hironimo lastima helped to spread the truth in the mountains, even though there were dangers.

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:03.569
They said that don't go to the remote display, there are still hundreds there.

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:09.569
We complied with the admonition and still my head is still here.

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.569
The sisters were effective in teaching the truth to the local people.

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:19.569
Then in turn, the locals were baptized and became pioneers.

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:24.569
They understood the culture of their own people and knew how to witness effectively.

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:27.569
Sister Nora Fajardo was among them.

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:34.569
Although we are just two, we are very brave, pristingly, useless,

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:46.569
to all the people, to the whole world, to give us power to do the work of the cybermaking.

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:51.569
Through such efforts, the number of publishers continued to increase,

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:55.569
surpassing 77,000 by 1975.

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:58.569
In November 2022,

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:05.569
for the first time, over 240,000 publishers reported field service activity.

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:10.569
Also, over 210,000 Bible studies were conducted.

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:15.569
All of this, as we were coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic.

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:20.569
Recently, when a girl named Stephanie saw the books and magazines at a literature cart,

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:26.569
she told her mother that she already finished reading the publications they picked up previously.

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:30.569
Stephanie asked for a copy of Enjoy Life Forever,

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:35.569
a Bible study was offered, and with her parents' permission, Stephanie accepted.

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:40.569
Later, she learned God's personal name Jehovah.

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:44.569
Now, every time she prays, she uses God's name.

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:47.569
Stephanie continues with her study of the Bible.

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:53.849
From January 16th through the 27th, 2023,

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:55.849
the Philippines received a branch visit.

00:03:55.849 --> 00:04:01.849
In connection with the visit, a special meeting was held at the Metro Manila Assembly Hall

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:03.849
in Sunday, January 22nd.

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:10.129
This was the first large in-person event in nearly three years.

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:15.129
Total attendance was 341,643,

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:19.129
around 100,000 more than the number of publishers.

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:23.129
After the program, we enjoyed a special meal and musical program.

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:33.240
The Philippines' Bethel family is happy and colorful.

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:38.240
Each day, we enjoyed association, worship, and delicious food.

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:43.240
We also met with each of the departments to provide encouragement.

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:49.240
What a joy it is to be part of our united, loving, international family.

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:53.240
How true are the words of Isaiah 24-15?

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:58.240
In the islands of the sea, they will glorify the name of Jehovah.

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:07.240
In the islands of the sea, they will glorify the name of Jehovah.
