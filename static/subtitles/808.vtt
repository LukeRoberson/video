00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:05.679
Jesus said, as recorded at Matthew 11.27,

00:00:05.679 --> 00:00:09.160
no one fully knows the Father,

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.359
except the Son,

00:00:11.359 --> 00:00:17.059
and anyone to whom the Son is willing to reveal Him.

00:00:17.059 --> 00:00:19.660
This teaches us two things.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:25.600
First, that it is possible for us to know the Father fully.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.839
And second, that Jesus is the key to knowing Jehovah.

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:37.740
Jesus clearly identified his role in revealing the Father.

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.240
On his last night here on Earth,

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:46.079
he told his apostles as recorded at John 146,

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.320
I am the way and the truth and the life.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:56.619
No one comes to the Father except through me.

00:00:56.619 --> 00:01:00.960
Only through Jesus can we truly know the Father

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.500
and have an approved relationship with Him.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.799
Earlier at the Transfiguration,

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.159
Jehovah confirmed Jesus' pivotal role

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.500
when he instructed Peter James and John

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.000
to listen to Jesus.

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.840
For over a century,

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.319
the fateful and discreet slave

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:25.799
has provided a wide range of study aids

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.280
to help us learn about the life, ministry,

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.599
and teachings of Jesus Christ.

00:01:32.599 --> 00:01:36.280
These gifts enrich our study of God's Word.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.439
They shed light on the world he lived in.

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.760
The places he walked.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.510
The towns where he preached.

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.989
The landscapes he saw.

00:01:50.989 --> 00:01:53.629
The foodie ate.

00:01:53.629 --> 00:01:59.430
And even the seasons in which various events took place.

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.189
These printed publications are more than just words on a page.

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:07.109
They illuminate Jesus' personality

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:09.389
and reveal his qualities,

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:13.270
which mirror those of his Heavenly Father.

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.509
We learn about Jesus' compassion,

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.389
self-sacrifice, humility, power,

00:02:21.389 --> 00:02:25.590
boldness, courage, and love.

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:28.710
More importantly,

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.150
focusing on Jesus' teachings and example,

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.990
draws closer to the one who sent Him.

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.550
Our meetings, assemblies, and conventions

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.550
also deepen our love and appreciation for God's Son.

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:45.669
In more recent years,

00:02:45.669 --> 00:02:48.990
Jehovah's Organization has used video

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:53.990
to reach the hearts of all those attending our conventions.

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.030
But how can we continue to help honest-hearted ones

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.629
to understand Jesus' role as King and High Priest

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:07.270
and to help them acquire the mind of Christ?

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:13.229
Well, bringing events of Jesus' ministry to life on screen

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:18.229
or the printed page is not without its challenges.

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:22.860
As you know, the governing body

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.020
had those full-costum dramas for years at conventions

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:30.539
that never was Jesus depicted.

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:33.139
And you can understand the challenge

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:34.860
who's gonna play Jesus.

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.699
Can you imagine trying to select brothers

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:43.699
in, say, 200, 300, even more different places

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.219
to play the role of Jesus Christ?

00:03:47.219 --> 00:03:49.219
But then finally, for a certainty,

00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:52.780
he made him Lord and Christ, part one, part two.

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.539
We went ahead, governing body,

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:56.819
proved it, go ahead, let's have that.

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:58.139
And it worked very well.

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:01.219
When you see Jesus with the woman

00:04:01.219 --> 00:04:04.939
that had a flow of blood and the tenderness in our video

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:08.780
of Jesus dealing with that woman and her fear

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.620
and yet her confidence that she could be healed by Him

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.500
and the way Jesus treated her,

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:17.579
that conveyed something that we would not always bring up

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:19.740
in our imagination.

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:23.100
So once we saw the reaction from the brothers and sisters,

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.579
how their hearts were touched by this presentation,

00:04:26.579 --> 00:04:29.259
we could see this is a very effective way

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:31.259
to portray Jesus' teachings.

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:34.259
What could boost your spirituality more

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:37.500
than actually seeing the scriptures come alive?

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:43.220
But now, here is a very exciting announcement.

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.620
The governing body is pleased to announce

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.779
that a very special video series about Jesus

00:04:52.779 --> 00:04:54.699
is currently being developed.

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:58.980
Work is underway to develop and produce

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:03.980
a new live action dramatic series on Jesus Christ.

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:07.860
The title of the series is,

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.220
the good news according to Jesus.

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:15.259
This series will combine the strengths

00:05:15.259 --> 00:05:19.300
of all our preceding research and study tools

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:23.779
with the power of the moving image

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:25.699
and will enable the viewer to gain

00:05:25.699 --> 00:05:30.699
an even deeper understanding of Jesus' life and ministry,

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:35.100
which in turn increases our knowledge of Jehovah.

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:39.860
Although other religious and commercial institutions

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:44.180
have produced various films on the life of Jesus,

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:46.019
these have often been tainted

00:05:46.019 --> 00:05:48.740
by unscriptural views of Jesus,

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:53.740
or they have placed excessive emphasis on violence

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:59.339
and existing video productions focus on one Bible book

00:05:59.339 --> 00:06:03.819
at a time, or only on specific episodes

00:06:03.819 --> 00:06:05.660
of Jesus' ministry on earth.

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:09.939
The good news according to Jesus, however,

00:06:09.939 --> 00:06:14.620
will show all the events of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.420
in the order in which they happened,

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:20.740
and in as much of the rich detail,

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:25.220
as current research and Bible understanding will allow.

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:28.699
Often a presentation like the one

00:06:28.699 --> 00:06:33.540
you're about to see is shown after a feature-linked drama

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:35.180
is released.

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:39.139
Such behind-the-scenes videos help us to understand

00:06:39.139 --> 00:06:44.139
and appreciate various facets of the video-making process.

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:49.500
Today, however, we are giving you a preview,

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:53.699
a first look at an upcoming convention project

00:06:53.699 --> 00:06:56.019
that will take years to complete.

00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:00.420
In view of the large scope of this project,

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:04.459
we encourage you to make it a matter of earnest prayer

00:07:04.459 --> 00:07:09.860
to Jehovah and please support it

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:13.220
according to your circumstances.

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:19.480
Would you like to see what episode one might look like?

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:21.879
To provide an advanced impression of the look

00:07:21.879 --> 00:07:24.160
and feel of an episode,

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:28.160
audio video services prepare storyboards.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.480
We're pleased to share with you now

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:50.079
an excerpt from an animated storyboard.

00:07:50.279 --> 00:07:53.439
Assuming that he was in the group traveling together,

00:07:53.439 --> 00:07:54.800
they went to Dave's journey

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:56.560
and then began to search for him

00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:05.220
among the relatives and acquaintances,

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:07.339
but not finding him.

00:08:07.339 --> 00:08:32.340
They returned to Jerusalem and made a diligent search for him.

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:37.659
Well, after three days, they found him in the temple,

00:08:37.659 --> 00:08:40.580
sitting in the midst of the teachers and listening to them

00:08:41.659 --> 00:08:46.519
and asking them questions.

00:08:46.519 --> 00:08:50.039
But all those listening to him were in constant amazement

00:08:50.039 --> 00:08:54.830
at his understanding and his answers.

00:08:54.830 --> 00:09:06.789
Now when his parents saw him, they were astounded.

00:09:06.789 --> 00:09:10.870
Child, why did you treat us this way?

00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:15.350
Here, your father and I have been frantically looking for you.

00:09:16.509 --> 00:09:18.950
Why were you looking for me?

00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:22.149
Did you not know that I must be in the house of my father?

00:09:23.149 --> 00:09:25.350
However, they did not understand

00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:26.590
what he was saying to them.

00:09:27.629 --> 00:09:30.870
Then he went down with them and returned to Nazareth

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:32.549
and he continued subject to them.

00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:47.259
Also, his mother carefully kept all these sayings in her heart.

00:09:47.259 --> 00:09:50.259
And Jesus went on progressing in wisdom

00:09:50.259 --> 00:09:53.379
and in physical growth and in favor

00:09:53.379 --> 00:09:58.269
with God and men.

00:09:58.269 --> 00:10:01.669
The true light that gives light to every sort of man

00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:08.700
was about to come into the world.

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:10.899
Of course, this is not the final video.

00:10:11.899 --> 00:10:16.899
Rather, it's an example of how the words on a page

00:10:16.899 --> 00:10:18.659
can come to life.

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:23.379
Preparing simple basic drawings to convey the idea

00:10:23.379 --> 00:10:27.700
of a video is one of the early visual tools

00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:30.220
used during the approval process.

00:10:31.139 --> 00:10:35.740
The animatic review is a very early milestone

00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:38.259
for the visual storytelling.

00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:41.940
But how has the project been developed?

00:10:42.899 --> 00:10:45.700
What direction has the governing body given

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:49.259
for bringing events in Jesus' life to the screen?

00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:54.620
So first of all, the governing body approved the concept

00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:56.980
of producing a production like this.

00:10:57.980 --> 00:10:59.899
But there were some questions.

00:10:59.899 --> 00:11:00.980
How do you do it?

00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:05.179
So three options were given to the governing body.

00:11:05.179 --> 00:11:08.059
The first option was for us just to have

00:11:08.059 --> 00:11:10.899
a theatrical stage production,

00:11:10.899 --> 00:11:13.620
similar to what we'd already done.

00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:18.620
The second set of options involved having a narrator speak

00:11:20.179 --> 00:11:23.259
and just read the sections of Scripture

00:11:23.259 --> 00:11:25.419
and in the background to have acting,

00:11:25.419 --> 00:11:28.259
but not actually to have Jesus speaking

00:11:28.259 --> 00:11:31.460
or those involved with Jesus speaking.

00:11:32.299 --> 00:11:34.340
And then finally, the third option,

00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:36.659
which is, of course, the hardest

00:11:36.659 --> 00:11:41.659
and involves a lot of work is to do a real life drama.

00:11:42.539 --> 00:11:45.220
So we were interested to see how the governing body

00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:46.980
would feel about this.

00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:49.740
And what a joyous time it was to see the brothers say,

00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:52.460
we want the best for the brotherhood.

00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:56.539
We want them to be able to see the power and impact

00:11:56.539 --> 00:11:58.299
of what Jesus taught.

00:11:58.299 --> 00:12:00.500
Yes, we want the third option.

00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:04.059
So then we realized there's a lot of work ahead.

00:12:04.059 --> 00:12:08.220
It's easy to think the inspired text is there,

00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:10.059
what's to write.

00:12:10.059 --> 00:12:13.419
But it's not as simple as just taking a little half hour

00:12:13.419 --> 00:12:15.899
chunks out of the four gospel accounts

00:12:15.899 --> 00:12:19.340
and throwing them on script and filming them.

00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:21.740
Which gospel account do you use?

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:24.379
Do you use Matthew's account, Mark's, Luke's?

00:12:24.379 --> 00:12:27.620
So very quickly, we saw the need to lay each

00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:31.700
of the four gospel accounts side by side

00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:36.820
and decide which account in every case, every event

00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:40.340
gives us the fullest picture, the most details.

00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:43.259
So even if you can't say everything that appears

00:12:43.259 --> 00:12:45.740
in all four accounts, you use the one

00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:48.139
to carry the bulk of the story.

00:12:48.139 --> 00:12:50.620
The others provide the rest of the details

00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:52.139
that we'll actually see.

00:12:52.139 --> 00:12:54.940
The brothers who help write the dramas,

00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:57.899
they have a tremendous amount of work to do.

00:12:57.899 --> 00:13:00.580
But then there also are those who do the research

00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:03.059
just to make sure little details are correct,

00:13:03.059 --> 00:13:05.379
whether it be the shoes a person has on

00:13:05.379 --> 00:13:07.500
or whether he even wears shoes.

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:13.379
When you show something on film, you are committing yourself.

00:13:13.379 --> 00:13:16.740
You are saying this is the explanation.

00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:19.580
Or in some cases, the application,

00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:22.379
it goes beyond illustration, it's the explanation,

00:13:22.379 --> 00:13:24.220
it's the way to understand what happened.

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:26.860
And that is what sticks with people's memories.

00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:30.820
So it's a huge responsibility to get that right.

00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:34.899
So our research department already has a lot of information.

00:13:34.899 --> 00:13:39.059
But doing something like this is yet another step

00:13:39.059 --> 00:13:42.059
down the path of being very, very difficult

00:13:42.059 --> 00:13:44.620
because there are a lot more questions come up.

00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:46.179
How are we going to depict the devil?

00:13:46.179 --> 00:13:48.139
How do you show Jesus walking on water?

00:13:48.179 --> 00:13:51.820
What footwear was allowed in the soarig?

00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:53.179
And what's a soarig?

00:13:53.179 --> 00:13:56.940
Research is pivotal in this.

00:13:56.940 --> 00:14:00.100
So you make a decision about what to depict.

00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:04.259
But then there are details when it comes to

00:14:04.259 --> 00:14:08.539
not just telling it, not just reading what happened,

00:14:08.539 --> 00:14:12.419
but now that you have to show what happened,

00:14:12.419 --> 00:14:13.659
how do you do that?

00:14:13.659 --> 00:14:15.340
If you take something that's static,

00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:17.580
like a piece of artwork that's well researched,

00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:21.059
solid sources, and now you bring it to life.

00:14:21.059 --> 00:14:24.500
In many respects, more research needs to go into this

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:28.299
so that everything is looked at from various angles.

00:14:28.299 --> 00:14:32.539
So let me explain the challenge we have with John Chapter 6.

00:14:32.539 --> 00:14:36.179
If we look at map 3B in the appendix section,

00:14:36.179 --> 00:14:39.740
just imagine we have the sea of Galilee here.

00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:41.539
Now, according to what it shows us,

00:14:41.539 --> 00:14:46.340
we have magnet in here on this side of the sea of Galilee.

00:14:46.379 --> 00:14:48.379
And up here we have Capernaum.

00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:52.340
Now, according to what this tells us,

00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:55.860
Jesus performed his miracle across on this side

00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:57.500
of the sea of Galilee,

00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:00.539
and then the apostles traveled by boat

00:15:00.539 --> 00:15:02.379
to this general area.

00:15:02.379 --> 00:15:04.019
Of course, Jesus joined up with them

00:15:04.019 --> 00:15:06.100
when he walked on the water.

00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:08.259
So according to John Chapter 6,

00:15:08.259 --> 00:15:10.940
Jesus starts to teach the crowd

00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:13.899
as he was walking along the sea shore.

00:15:13.899 --> 00:15:16.740
But by the end of John Chapter 6,

00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:20.220
we see that Jesus is actually speaking of that time

00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:21.779
here in Capernaum.

00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:24.659
So the question comes up,

00:15:24.659 --> 00:15:27.860
what part of the dialogue was actually stated

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:30.100
here in the synagogue in Capernaum,

00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:32.860
and what part was stated along the sea shore

00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:34.620
as he was walking along?

00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:38.419
So we'll have to do some research into John Chapter 6

00:15:38.419 --> 00:15:41.940
and see where is a good break for us to realize

00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:44.940
what words were actually said there in the synagogue.

00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:46.220
That's the challenge.

00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:48.820
We need for the friends to be able to watch

00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:52.899
this video series and feel they're actually there.

00:15:52.899 --> 00:15:55.299
And what they are seeing is as close to the way

00:15:55.299 --> 00:15:57.779
it must have been as we can possibly make it.

00:15:57.779 --> 00:16:01.019
And the role of research helps us to ensure that.

00:16:02.059 --> 00:16:04.980
With scripts being developed and approved,

00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:07.740
the production team continues work

00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:11.500
with a visual look and feel of the series.

00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:13.860
So when we found out that the project involved

00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:15.700
the entirety of Jesus' ministry,

00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:17.299
it was simply overwhelming.

00:16:17.299 --> 00:16:18.620
Once we've read our script,

00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:22.779
we go into a phase where we start working with storyboards.

00:16:22.779 --> 00:16:25.659
Storyboards are kind of like first pass

00:16:25.659 --> 00:16:28.340
at what this story might look like.

00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:31.860
That's compiled into what's called an animatic,

00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:33.580
which is a type of video.

00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:36.340
So you've got an aeration, you've got dialogue,

00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:39.940
and you've got music, but it's to these cartoon boards.

00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:42.179
It's great because it gets you prepared

00:16:42.179 --> 00:16:45.100
so that on set, the challenges don't just pop up,

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:48.500
you can anticipate them.

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:50.580
Concept art is a communication tool

00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:52.820
to help us to get all in the same page.

00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:58.620
Concept art helps us to get the mood of it, the lighting,

00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:01.220
to experience it maybe from a perspective

00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:03.019
that we hadn't thought of it before.

00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:08.059
The story of Jesus' ministry isn't just dry, cold facts.

00:17:08.059 --> 00:17:10.380
It's actually human stories.

00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:13.019
When we see how different people respond

00:17:13.019 --> 00:17:15.019
and react to Jesus' ministry,

00:17:15.019 --> 00:17:17.980
how they're shaped and molded by what the experience,

00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:20.619
that's essentially that character's arc.

00:17:20.619 --> 00:17:23.859
We go in and say, okay, where does our character start?

00:17:23.859 --> 00:17:25.339
How does he grow?

00:17:25.339 --> 00:17:28.660
And where is he by the end of this series?

00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:31.660
By seeing his struggles, seeing his challenges,

00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:33.940
it makes that character more relatable.

00:17:34.859 --> 00:17:37.940
As years of development passed,

00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:42.819
the immense gop of this project came into clear focus.

00:17:42.819 --> 00:17:47.339
A natural question arose, where would we record it?

00:17:47.339 --> 00:17:50.220
When we were doing the production of Jonah,

00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:52.539
we used parts of Southern California,

00:17:52.539 --> 00:17:54.819
and we thought that would be a very good location.

00:17:54.819 --> 00:17:57.380
So that was proposed to the governing body,

00:17:57.380 --> 00:18:00.299
and they said, thank you very much,

00:18:00.299 --> 00:18:03.180
but we would rather that you use existing

00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:05.779
Bethel facilities that would be available

00:18:05.819 --> 00:18:08.859
and that maybe has not been utilized to its full potential.

00:18:08.859 --> 00:18:12.619
So we worked with worldwide design construction,

00:18:12.619 --> 00:18:16.180
and they provided a list of some of the branches that had space.

00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:18.140
And as we were doing so,

00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:21.660
it came to our attention that in Australasia,

00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:25.380
the printer was about to be phased out.

00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:30.380
At the end of 2015, the printing work was moved to Japan.

00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:32.339
The press was in put up for sale.

00:18:32.339 --> 00:18:34.619
It sold about three years later.

00:18:34.619 --> 00:18:37.019
So now we had this big warehouse space,

00:18:37.019 --> 00:18:38.700
just what we needed for a studio.

00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:44.019
We just were stunned to think that such a project

00:18:44.019 --> 00:18:45.500
could be accomplished here,

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:49.660
but I think we've also seen so many evidences of Jehovah's blessing

00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:52.339
on this project that it's very clear

00:18:52.339 --> 00:18:53.500
it's something he wants.

00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:56.180
The temporary accommodation here at the branch

00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:58.140
was due for demolition,

00:18:58.140 --> 00:19:01.579
and I mean, like the build-ozes were almost at the gate.

00:19:01.579 --> 00:19:04.220
So we were able to stop those build-ozes,

00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:08.140
and as a result, we're currently renovating those residents.

00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:10.579
Jehovah's hem was definitely in that experience

00:19:10.579 --> 00:19:13.740
without the stopping of that demolition.

00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:15.619
We wouldn't have had enough accommodation

00:19:15.619 --> 00:19:17.500
to look after this project.

00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:21.660
It was as if Jehovah was dropping this option in our laps

00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:25.940
with all the criteria that we needed to do this project.

00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:28.980
With the primary location selected,

00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:32.299
production design helps take a concept

00:19:32.299 --> 00:19:34.299
and make it a reality.

00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:37.259
Our goal as production design

00:19:37.259 --> 00:19:40.819
is to immerse the audience in the story.

00:19:40.819 --> 00:19:42.500
If they have that sense,

00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:47.299
now they're paying attention to what's being set on screen,

00:19:47.299 --> 00:19:50.180
what they can learn, what they can benefit from it.

00:19:51.779 --> 00:19:53.700
It's one thing to design something,

00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:56.819
but then to execute that design is all another thing.

00:19:56.819 --> 00:19:58.619
Even like with the throne room,

00:19:58.619 --> 00:20:00.579
this actually is too much work.

00:20:00.579 --> 00:20:02.220
We have to simplify it.

00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:04.180
Do we need to show three walls?

00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:06.539
Can we just get away with building two walls

00:20:06.539 --> 00:20:09.660
and have the same effect, the same production quality?

00:20:10.539 --> 00:20:15.660
Usually we design a set, we build a set, we fill in the set,

00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:17.579
and then we turn the set down.

00:20:17.579 --> 00:20:20.339
Put this project unique in that we're not doing that.

00:20:20.339 --> 00:20:23.420
These buildings, these structures that we're going to be filming

00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:25.779
are going to last for years.

00:20:25.779 --> 00:20:27.980
And so they have to be built that way.

00:20:28.019 --> 00:20:32.339
So how do we combine modern day building standards

00:20:32.339 --> 00:20:33.500
to make it last,

00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:36.299
but still make it look like an old ancient building

00:20:36.299 --> 00:20:38.779
that was built 2,000 years ago?

00:20:38.779 --> 00:20:41.779
We were looking for a certain type of finish,

00:20:41.779 --> 00:20:42.859
concrete finish.

00:20:42.859 --> 00:20:47.259
Through a website, we found there was a company over in Perth

00:20:47.259 --> 00:20:49.579
that was able to achieve this.

00:20:49.579 --> 00:20:52.619
And after calling them, find out their brothers.

00:20:52.619 --> 00:20:55.220
And those brothers have been able to come over

00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:57.099
and help us with their expertise

00:20:57.099 --> 00:20:59.299
to get the right type of finish.

00:20:59.299 --> 00:21:02.980
The support from all those under the Australasia branch

00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:06.700
territory has been faith strengthening.

00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:08.779
So one of the biggest needs we probably

00:21:08.779 --> 00:21:11.500
have at the moment would be auditioning.

00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:15.140
We absolutely need more volunteers for acting.

00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:17.339
It's a unique and new form of sacred service

00:21:17.339 --> 00:21:20.819
is something that probably most never thought they would ever

00:21:20.819 --> 00:21:24.700
do or be asked to do, but there is definitely a need.

00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:26.619
The more that can make themselves available

00:21:26.619 --> 00:21:28.140
through this auditioning process,

00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:31.220
allows us to have the right people and the roles.

00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:35.259
One fundamental principle that underlies any good acting

00:21:35.259 --> 00:21:36.299
is empathy.

00:21:36.299 --> 00:21:37.940
It's something that we all learn as Christians.

00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:41.380
It's not about showing the behavior in big ways.

00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:43.220
It's about understanding who the character is.

00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:45.099
And then it kind of exudes naturally.

00:21:45.099 --> 00:21:47.299
Jehovah's organization will always train us

00:21:47.299 --> 00:21:51.140
and Jehovah's spirit will make us ready for the task

00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:52.579
that's ahead of us.

00:21:52.579 --> 00:21:54.140
It's simple training,

00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:56.779
but it's definitely designed to help somebody

00:21:56.779 --> 00:21:59.500
get comfortable in front of a camera,

00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:01.779
performing in front of many people,

00:22:01.779 --> 00:22:04.299
and being able to relax, being able to be themselves.

00:22:04.299 --> 00:22:07.259
To see our brothers and sisters offering themselves,

00:22:07.259 --> 00:22:12.539
putting themselves out in this way is wonderful.

00:22:12.539 --> 00:22:15.339
When this project was first discussed,

00:22:15.339 --> 00:22:18.180
it kind of felt like so far into the future

00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:19.779
and almost in a possibility.

00:22:19.779 --> 00:22:24.500
It was so big in scope, but now it's actually happening.

00:22:24.539 --> 00:22:27.220
And you see Jehovah's blessing on the planning,

00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:32.579
on the construction, on the people.

00:22:32.579 --> 00:22:34.420
Will there be challenges?

00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:35.539
Oh, yeah.

00:22:35.539 --> 00:22:39.220
Guaranteed, but if Jehovah wants something done,

00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:40.420
that's what happens.

00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:42.740
We have things at the right time,

00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:44.099
and that's what we've done.

00:22:44.099 --> 00:22:46.539
We've advanced now to where we're able to do it

00:22:46.539 --> 00:22:49.019
in such a wonderful way for the whole world.

00:22:49.019 --> 00:22:51.299
We are working with the best words

00:22:51.299 --> 00:22:54.579
that have ever been spoken on this planet.

00:22:54.579 --> 00:22:57.579
Words that have power and meaning.

00:22:57.579 --> 00:23:00.579
This is such a huge endeavor,

00:23:00.579 --> 00:23:04.819
and yet Jehovah has shown us his direction all along.

00:23:04.819 --> 00:23:06.619
It needs to be done,

00:23:06.619 --> 00:23:08.940
with this project being blessed by Jehovah,

00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:10.579
that's what's going to happen.

00:23:10.579 --> 00:23:14.539
The genuine good news according to Jesus.

00:23:14.539 --> 00:23:18.430
That's what we're going to have.

00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:22.549
It's clear that Jehovah is blessing

00:23:22.549 --> 00:23:25.990
this tremendous undertaking.

00:23:26.029 --> 00:23:28.829
The good news according to Jesus

00:23:28.829 --> 00:23:33.150
will help all of us to teach the truth about Jesus,

00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:36.309
and it will help us to deepen our own appreciation

00:23:36.309 --> 00:23:40.029
for his loving, sacrifice, and behalf of all mankind.

00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:45.990
Jesus said, as recorded at John 14, 13, and 14,

00:23:47.349 --> 00:23:52.549
whatever you ask in my name, I will do this

00:23:52.549 --> 00:23:55.069
so that the Father may be glorified

00:23:55.069 --> 00:23:57.269
in connection with the Son.

00:23:57.269 --> 00:24:01.549
If you ask anything in my name, I will do it.

00:24:02.829 --> 00:24:05.470
Thus, our sincere prayer

00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:10.470
is that this multi-year project will be a grand success,

00:24:10.869 --> 00:24:13.509
and will result in the salvation

00:24:13.509 --> 00:24:17.589
of many more true disciples to the praise

00:24:17.589 --> 00:24:19.430
of Jehovah's great name.

00:24:20.349 --> 00:24:23.950
Thank you all for your continued prayers and support.

00:24:24.869 --> 00:24:26.630
Thank you for encouraging yet others

00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:29.829
to support this project with their prayers,

00:24:29.829 --> 00:24:32.630
talents, time, and assets.

00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:34.710
Thank you to our dear brothers and sisters

00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:39.309
in Austral, Asia as well, for your willing spirit.

00:24:40.309 --> 00:24:44.150
All of us eagerly await what the future holds

00:24:44.150 --> 00:24:47.230
for this good work ahead of us.

00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:52.869
The prologue to the book, Come Be My Follower states this.

00:24:54.390 --> 00:24:58.150
Jehovah said to his only begotten Son to the earth

00:24:58.150 --> 00:25:00.950
to give his life as a ransom.

00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:05.950
In addition to dying for us, that Son showed us how to live.

00:25:06.670 --> 00:25:10.589
With each step he took, he kept his integrity

00:25:10.589 --> 00:25:14.349
and brought joy to his Father's heart.

00:25:14.349 --> 00:25:18.789
Jesus also showed us how to be like his Father.

00:25:18.789 --> 00:25:21.349
The ways and the will of the Father

00:25:21.349 --> 00:25:26.349
found perfect expression in the words and deeds of the Son.

00:25:29.150 --> 00:25:34.150
If we want to draw closer to Jehovah and know him fully,

00:25:34.750 --> 00:25:39.349
we must continue to learn more about his Son.

00:25:39.349 --> 00:25:43.349
May this new video series help us to grow and love

00:25:43.349 --> 00:25:48.349
for the Son and our loving Father, Jehovah.
