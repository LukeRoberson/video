00:00:01.139 --> 00:00:04.179
What is envy? Do you know?

00:00:04.179 --> 00:00:08.820
It's important that we be able to identify the symptoms of envy.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.019
Why? Because envy is an expression

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:17.420
of hatred. It's an enemy of peace

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.339
and if left unchecked, it can result in spiritual

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:26.359
death. As described in the Bible,

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:31.059
envy has two symptoms. The first is probably more

00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:38.020
familiar, an envious person wants what someone else has.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:43.939
It's the second symptom that makes envy especially dangerous.

00:00:43.939 --> 00:00:49.100
An envious person not only wants what someone else has,

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.100
he doesn't want the other person to have it.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.820
Here's an example. In the first century,

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.100
Jewish religious leaders envy Jesus

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:05.219
because Jesus was much appreciated by the common people.

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:09.140
Jesus dealt with people, including lolley ones,

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.459
in a way that dignified them. As a result,

00:01:12.459 --> 00:01:15.060
he was appreciated.

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.859
The religious leaders envied him,

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:22.819
but rather than adjusting their own way of dealing with people,

00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:29.939
they attacked Jesus verbally in an effort to destroy his good reputation.

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.459
They spread malicious slander.

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:37.140
Not only did they want what Jesus had,

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.340
they didn't want Jesus to have it.

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.579
No wonder envy is listed as one of the works of the flush

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.819
in Galatians chapter 5 verse 21.

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:55.680
It's a dangerous quality that we need to avoid.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.659
How does envy disrupt peace?

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:09.259
Envy undermines damages or even destroys relationships

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.659
in the family and in the congregation.

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:20.219
Consider the example of Jacob and his 12 sons.

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:26.219
Jacob had special affection for one of his sons, Joseph.

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:29.500
As a result, Joseph's brothers became envious.

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:35.099
How did the envy manifest itself? What was the fruitage?

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:37.419
Well, they dealt treacherously with Joseph

00:02:37.419 --> 00:02:41.580
selling him into slavery. And as if that weren't bad enough,

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.460
they compounded their wrong by lying to Jacob,

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.900
telling him that Joseph was dead.

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:56.379
According to the Bible account, Jacob refused to be comforted.

00:02:56.379 --> 00:03:03.740
He mourned Joseph for years. What a terrible consequence of envy.

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:11.419
It's clear that envy allows no room for love, compassion, or kindness.

00:03:11.419 --> 00:03:14.699
Those qualities go out the window.

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:19.819
And they're replaced by qualities such as a hatred,

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:28.060
strife, fits of anger. Can envy disrupt the peace of a congregation?

00:03:28.219 --> 00:03:31.580
Consider the examples of Korah, Daithun, and Abairun.

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:37.979
They envied Moses and Aaron in the congregation of Israel.

00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:42.939
How did that envy manifest itself?

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:47.580
Well, they began to speak negatively, critically of Jehovah's

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.740
representatives, even accusing Moses of playing the prince

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:54.460
and lifting himself up above the others.

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:01.419
They forgot that Jehovah had put Moses and Aaron

00:04:01.419 --> 00:04:03.580
in their positions of responsibility.

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.740
How did Jehovah react to that manifestation of envy?

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:15.500
He destroyed those three men and all who supported them

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.459
for a time the congregation was robbed of its peace,

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:23.899
and the account certainly provides some insight into Jehovah's view

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:30.220
of envy. Now, by this point, you're no doubt thinking I would never want

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.939
something so badly that I would damage someone else to get it,

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:40.060
but we're all imperfect. We have a treacherous heart,

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:45.899
and envy is insidious. In the following dramatization,

00:04:46.459 --> 00:04:50.620
notice how envy threatens to disrupt peace.

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:13.470
Clearly, bad news.

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:22.129
She's a sweating. It reminds me I want to speak to her about a necklace.

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:24.930
You too. You don't think she's showing off?

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:31.009
No. Everyone thinks she's miswonderful. She's starting to agree.

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:39.939
Is this just about Haley? It seems it's all about Haley.

00:05:42.829 --> 00:05:48.819
Your tea's getting cold, and you're changing the subject.

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:53.779
No, but you've brought this up before.

00:05:55.699 --> 00:06:01.870
What is it? Your friends, you pioneered together.

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:03.790
Yeah, and that's why I'm concerned.

00:06:06.029 --> 00:06:13.949
Concern is good, but is there just a little bit of envy in there?

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:32.300
What did you notice? Well, Emily is suffering from an onset of envy.

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:37.100
Did you notice how she questioned Haley's motives?

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:43.980
And potentially called Haley's reputation into question.

00:06:46.399 --> 00:06:48.160
It could happen to any one of us.

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:53.759
So how do we battle and conquer envy?

00:06:54.720 --> 00:07:01.519
By cultivating two beautiful qualities, humility and contentment.

00:07:02.959 --> 00:07:06.160
Let's see what the Bible has to say about humility.

00:07:06.879 --> 00:07:13.040
Turn with me, please, to Philippians chapter 2, and we're going to begin reading in verse 3.

00:07:16.209 --> 00:07:26.180
Philippians chapter 2 verse 3 do nothing out of contentiousness or out of egotism.

00:07:27.139 --> 00:07:32.980
What is egotism? Well, it's having an exaggerated opinion of oneself.

00:07:34.339 --> 00:07:40.339
Do you think that the religious leaders in Jesus' day, Joseph's brothers,

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:49.459
Korah, Nathan, and Abiram had this affliction? Did they have an exaggerated view of themselves

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:57.620
without question? But it's an affliction that could affect any one of us. What is the solution?

00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:06.899
Well, Paul continues, but with humility or lowliness of mind, consider others superior to you,

00:08:06.899 --> 00:08:11.620
or consider others as more important than yourself.

00:08:12.579 --> 00:08:19.220
Now, that kind of mindset allows a person to do what stated in verse 4,

00:08:20.259 --> 00:08:27.379
as you look out not only for your own interests, but also for the interests of others.

00:08:29.379 --> 00:08:38.019
A humble person looks out for others. He doesn't feel that he deserves more than others.

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:48.899
A content person is satisfied with what he has. He doesn't compare his privilege or his possession

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:58.820
with another person's privilege or possession. He's content. Humility, contentment.

00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:04.259
With Jehovah's help, we can cultivate these beautiful qualities,

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:12.179
qualities that leave no room for envy. And in doing so, we promote peace,

00:09:13.059 --> 00:09:21.700
inner peace, peace in our family, and peace in the congregation. And you can be sure that Jehovah

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:29.779
appreciates that. Brother Gaius Glockentine, a helper to the publishing committee, will now present

00:09:29.779 --> 00:09:39.779
the next talk of the symposium. Put away peace records. Dis-honesty.
