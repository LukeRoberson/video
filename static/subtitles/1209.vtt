00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:06.290
Culture in my island is very strong.

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:10.669
For example, the head of the family can choose the family's religion

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:13.169
and also who they will marry.

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:21.510
One day, many family members of a boy that my father wanted me to marry

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.609
came to visit my father.

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.750
The purpose was that they could request that we would be married.

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.590
I respectfully explain that I could not do that.

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:35.869
So my father started beating me.

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:40.030
The first blow with the rod was very painful.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:46.229
But Jehovah helped me by moving Mama to act as if she would help him to beat me.

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:50.509
But instead, she didn't actually beat me.

00:00:50.509 --> 00:00:58.390
For six months, he imprisoned me in the house and he assigned me various hard jobs to do.

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:03.869
The thing that was the most difficult for me was not being with the brothers and sisters

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:06.709
doing spiritual activities for Jehovah.

00:01:06.709 --> 00:01:12.510
But what really strengthened me was the gift of prayer.

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.230
I would pray constantly and talk to Jehovah through prayer.

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:24.189
When I would do the meetings by myself, I would make a schedule on Saturday night.

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:28.189
Then on Sunday, when all my family went to church,

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:35.670
I would start by praying, singing, read the paragraph, raise my hand,

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.450
and I would answer the questions myself.

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.890
It was as if I was with my brothers and sisters at the meeting.

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:51.609
Also, I would wait to see my younger cousins every Sunday as they walked by,

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:56.609
because I knew they would visit my studies and return visits.

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:59.650
I just went to the kitchen to wait.

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:06.730
I waited for them and watched them go by, looking forward to being able to see them.

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:11.650
Even though they didn't see me, only I saw them.

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:17.210
And when they passed by, I saw that they went to preach where the Bible students were.

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:21.729
I really felt strengthened, happy.

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:28.729
During those trials I had to endure, there were times I was very scared, frightened.

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.250
I really needed the courage that Jehovah supplies.

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.849
That is why I begged Jehovah for courage.

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:43.889
And immediately, Jehovah gave me courage so that I didn't have to be afraid anymore.

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:48.449
I had peace and I was able to endure those trials.

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:50.650
By helping me to endure that test,

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.930
Jehovah helped me to experience the blessings that I'm having today.

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:07.250
Now, I am really happy.

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:13.449
In 2013, we decided to make a move from the United States to the Marshall Islands.

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:18.090
We have a combined family, nine children and 24 grandchildren.

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.530
We had a middle-income family,

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.330
and you know, you have everything at your disposal.

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:31.090
It was a big adjustment to move where we knew that we wouldn't have those conveniences.

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.370
Life here is very different from the United States.

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.449
Many of the houses don't have kitchens or indoor bathrooms.

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:43.009
And so even the house that we rented, there was no stove or refrigerator.

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:46.250
I was very apprehensive about making the move.

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:49.569
It's a little bit harder for older ones to learn a little language.

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:52.849
And so how would I be able to conduct Bible studies?

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:58.729
How would I be able to, as an elder, to be able to help out within the congregation?

00:03:58.729 --> 00:04:01.969
I had one study who had a really fierce dog,

00:04:01.969 --> 00:04:05.849
and I really didn't want to go back to that house.

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:10.250
But I went back to have the Bible study, and I didn't see the dog.

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.129
So I asked her, well, where is the dog?

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:15.129
And she said, my uncle ate him.

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:19.569
At 2 Chronicles 157, it says that, do not be discouraged.

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:22.569
There exists a reward for your activity.

00:04:22.569 --> 00:04:25.490
And so we visited and asserted ourselves in the work.

00:04:25.529 --> 00:04:29.529
So immediately we had like 10 Bible studies in two weeks.

00:04:29.529 --> 00:04:36.730
But the benefit of that is we would go over maybe chapter 1, 10 times.

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:40.370
And so through repetition and through due diligence,

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.850
it really facilitated us learning the language

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:46.290
and being able to use it to start with people

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:49.089
and help them to come to know your home.

00:04:49.089 --> 00:04:51.009
I'm a bit afraid of water.

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:52.649
We're on an island.

00:04:52.649 --> 00:04:56.410
You know, here I'm surrounded by water, and I cannot swim.

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:00.449
I had a campaign recently to preach through the outer islands.

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:03.850
So I have to think about the people.

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:08.529
When I think about their desire to learn more about God,

00:05:08.529 --> 00:05:12.209
their love for God, their love and respect for the Bible,

00:05:12.209 --> 00:05:17.370
it really motivates me to keep going, in spite of my fears.

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:20.529
And when you think about going from door to door,

00:05:20.529 --> 00:05:24.490
and every person will stop, stop what they're doing

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:26.129
to talk to you about God.

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:27.930
They'll accept the literature.

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:29.769
They want Bible studies.

00:05:29.769 --> 00:05:32.649
It's really a pioneer's dream.

00:05:32.649 --> 00:05:35.730
Their desire, their love for the truth

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:39.170
and wanting to know about Jehovah, that's an additional blessing.

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:41.689
That is encouraging strength in us.

00:05:41.689 --> 00:05:43.610
She says, it's a pioneer dream.

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:45.569
I say it's a pioneer's paradise.
