00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.349
Now let us consider two questions.

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:09.349
What do we have in common with Noah?

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:14.349
And how does his example apply to us?

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:20.350
Well, like Noah, we fully trust that Jehovah will fulfill his promise to end all wickedness

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:25.350
and that he will do so at exactly the right time.

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.350
Now, what help Noah to build his trust in Jehovah's promises?

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:34.350
One factor that must have helped him was his upbringing.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.350
Now, to confirm that statement, we will consider two of Noah's relatives

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.350
and no doubt they had a big influence on him.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:50.350
First, Noah must have received a godly upbringing from his father, Lamek.

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:57.350
The inside book states with certainty, Lamek had faith in God.

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:04.349
But how does the Bible indicate that Lamek and likely also his wife had strong faith in Jehovah?

00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:07.349
One indication is found in Genesis chapter 5.

00:01:07.349 --> 00:01:10.349
So let us consider that chapter for a moment.

00:01:10.349 --> 00:01:19.349
Now, if you would take the time, perhaps later today, to read verses 6 to 31 in chapter 5,

00:01:19.349 --> 00:01:25.349
you will know that these verses contain a list of eight fathers and eight sons.

00:01:25.349 --> 00:01:34.349
The list starts with father Seth and his son Inos and ends with father Lamek and his son Noah.

00:01:34.349 --> 00:01:40.349
Now, in this list, Lamek stands out from all other fathers.

00:01:40.349 --> 00:01:41.349
Why so?

00:01:41.349 --> 00:01:50.349
Of all eight fathers, only Lamek provides a reason for why he named his son in the way he did.

00:01:50.349 --> 00:01:55.349
Then we read that reason in verses 28 and 29.

00:01:55.349 --> 00:02:02.349
There it says, Lamek lived for 182 years and then became father to a son.

00:02:02.349 --> 00:02:04.349
He named him Noah.

00:02:04.349 --> 00:02:06.349
Now, let us pause you for a moment.

00:02:06.349 --> 00:02:12.349
The footnote gives us the likely meaning of the name Noah as rest or consolation.

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:14.349
But then comes the most significant part.

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:20.349
Lamek goes on to explain why he gave his son the name consolation.

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:23.349
In verse 29, Lamek adds,

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:28.349
this one will bring us comfort, or as the footnote says, relief from our labor

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:36.349
and from the painful toil of our hands because of the ground that Jehovah has cursed.

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:39.349
Now, note the expressions that Lamek used.

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:42.349
Painful toil.

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:45.349
The ground that Jehovah cursed.

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:51.349
So, Lamek's words show that he looked back to what had happened in the garden of Eden.

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:56.349
In fact, he used the very same words, cursed ground.

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:01.349
Pain that Jehovah had used when he told Adam after the rebellion.

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:04.349
Cursed is the ground on your account.

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:07.349
In pain, you will eat its produce.

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:13.349
By repeating Jehovah's words, Lamek indicated that he realized that the rebellion of Adam and Eve

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:20.349
had sentenced humans to pain from which there seemed no relief or comfort.

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:26.349
Indeed, Lamek had meditated on Jehovah's words.

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:33.349
But Lamek looked back not only to a dark time, but also forward to a bright time.

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:38.349
In the first part of verse 29 he said about his son,

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:42.349
this one will bring us comfort from our labor.

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:50.349
So clearly, Lamek hoped that his son Noah would be instrumental in bringing relief to men's situation.

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:57.349
Now, Lamek's words were much more than a warm sentiment expressed by a father to his son.

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:02.349
What is the real significance of Lamek's words about Noah?

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:10.349
But the inside book further states that Lamek's words were an inspired revelation of God's purpose and will.

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:17.350
So Lamek's words expressed Jehovah's thoughts and feelings about Noah.

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:24.350
Now Noah's father died five years before the flood, but his prophecy came true.

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:29.350
When did it happen? The watchtower of 2017 states,

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:37.350
Jehovah inspired Lamek to utter a prophecy about Noah and that prophecy came true after the flood.

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.350
When exactly did it come true?

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.350
We find the answer that Genesis 8 verse 21.

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:49.350
Shortly after the flood, when Noah offered burnt offerings to God, Jehovah said in his heart,

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:56.350
never again will I curse the ground on men's account.

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:03.350
Indeed, Noah had lived up to the meaning of the name that he had received from his father.

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:09.350
Because of Noah's faith and action, Jehovah used him to bring relief.

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:14.350
Now, how does this account of Noah and his father apply to us?

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:21.350
Well, like Noah in the past, many of us have had the privilege to be raised by Godly parents.

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:27.350
And we know that by serving Jehovah wholeheartedly, we bring great joy to the heart of our parents.

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:38.350
They are happy that we serve at assembly halls, at RTOs, at construction project, maintenance sites, at battle and in the local congregations.

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:54.350
And much like Lamek did in the past, Godly parents today pray to Jehovah that the sacred service that their children give at these locations may indeed bring comfort and relief to many.

00:05:55.350 --> 00:06:03.350
And for those of us who's Godly parents already fell asleep in death, well, we longed for the time when they come back to life and paradise,

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:08.350
and we can relate to them that we used our life fully in Jehovah's service.

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:20.350
How happy they will be when they hear that Godly training that they gave us helped us to build our faith in God's promises and to serve five Armageddon.

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:32.350
And likewise, we can imagine that when Noah is raised to life in paradise, he will long for the moment that he can tell to his father how he endure till the end of that old system and survive the flood.

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:43.350
And just think how happy Lamek will be when he hears that his son did indeed bring comfort and relief to many.

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:56.350
Now besides Lamek, who is the second relative who must have strengthened Noah trust in Jehovah's promises and in his protection, in his assurance to protect his servants?

00:06:56.350 --> 00:07:06.350
Well, here is a clue. Both Noah and his second relative are described in exactly the same way in the Bible.

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:18.350
In Genesis chapter 6 we read, Noah walked with the true God. In Genesis chapter 5 we read, Inok walked with the true God.

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:33.350
Inok was Noah's great grandfather. Now that Jehovah moved the writer of Genesis to describe these two men in exactly the same manner indicates that Noah had much in common with his great grandfather.

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:49.350
Now it's true that Noah never met Inok because Inok died before Noah was born. But Noah's father, life, overlapped for more than 100 years with that of Inok.

00:07:49.350 --> 00:08:03.350
So we can imagine that Lamek must have told stories to Noah about his grandfather how Inok prophesied courageously while surrounded by ungodly people, how these people hated Inok to the point that they wanted to kill him.

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:15.350
But despite being in danger, as we read in Genesis 5 verse 22, Inok continued to walk with the true God and Jehovah protected Inok.

00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:26.350
Well, as Noah listened to these stories and reflected on Inok's faith and courage, his desire to follow in Inok's footsteps no doubt grew stronger and stronger.

00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:40.350
In fact, Noah's faith became so strong that he continued to walk with God for 600 years until the time of the flood, in spite of the ungodly and violent people around him.

00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:52.350
Now, just as Noah must have been strengthened by the faith of his forefather, some of us may be the third or the fourth generation in our family who served Jehovah.

00:08:52.350 --> 00:09:04.350
If that's the case with you, your parents or grandparents likely told you stories about your relatives who served Jehovah perhaps way back in the time of brother Retaphord or even earlier.

00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:14.350
And as you listen to these stories about your faithful relatives, your desire to walk in their footsteps grew stronger and stronger.

00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:19.350
What though if we are not part of a family with a long line of witnesses?

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:30.350
Well, we too are encouraged by the examples of our brothers and sisters of previous generations when we read their life stories as found in the watchtower.

00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:36.350
As we learn about their courage and endurance, their stories strengthen our faith.

00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:54.350
Indeed, the examples of God's servants in the past as recorded in the Bible in our family history or in the life stories found in the watchtower help us to trust fully in the fulfillment of Jehovah's promises.

00:09:54.350 --> 00:10:05.350
In turn, that trust strengthens us to do what? To imitate Noah and walk with God not just now but forever.
