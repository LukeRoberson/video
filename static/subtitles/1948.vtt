00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:15.689
All human life, what we do, experience and feel, happens here in a small corner of the

00:00:15.689 --> 00:00:20.530
universe.

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:28.050
The more we learn, the more we wonder about the world and our place in it.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:34.219
Does life have a purpose?

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:37.840
Where did life come from?

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.710
Why are we here?

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:47.570
We may look for meaning in the path we choose in life.

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:57.460
One that makes a difference in the world, or that might provide us with a secure future.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:04.370
And we may center our life on close relationships with family and friends.

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:12.109
But do these things in themselves bring lasting satisfaction?

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:19.709
Often the most we can hope to accomplish is to leave behind a fading memory of who we

00:01:19.709 --> 00:01:25.840
were and what we did.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:35.000
What is the key to finding lasting enjoyment and purpose in life?

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:44.500
The Bible says that we are created with a spiritual need, just like our need for food.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:52.980
If we do not satisfy our spiritual hunger, we will never feel truly fulfilled.

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:59.579
And the invite says to know him and through his word the Bible, to learn how to get the

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.299
most out of life.

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:12.379
He says, I, Jehovah, am your God, the one teaching you to benefit yourself, the one guiding

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:21.180
you in the way you should walk, if only you would pay attention to my commandments.

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:27.020
Then your peace would become just like a river.

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:39.069
And your righteousness, like the waves of the sea, to worship God and to benefit from

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:50.419
his guidance, is the real purpose of life and he doesn't want our life to end.

00:02:50.419 --> 00:03:01.819
If we accept that truth, we can have a life with a real purpose, both now and forever.

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:10.259
