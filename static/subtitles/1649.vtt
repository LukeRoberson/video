00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:20.070
The Doverning Body and the Writing Committee take the responsibility of translating God's word very seriously.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:34.070
As we'll see in this report, the Bible translation done by Jehovah's people has played a key role in making Jehovah's word widely available in simple, clear language that touches the hearts of sincere people.

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:45.070
In 2021, we reached an exciting milestone. The New World translation is now available in whole or in part in well over 200 languages.

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.070
Let's look at a few key landmarks along the way.

00:00:48.070 --> 00:01:01.479
In 1950, my mother and her family were at Yankee Stadium when Brother Nor released the New World Translation. It was something unforgettable for them.

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:07.480
Years later, when I heard the recording of Brother Nor's talk, I understood why.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:25.650
But now, to the international, the opposite increase the assembly of Jehovah's Witnesses, the No-Wild translation of the Christian speech section.

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:35.540
No wonder he said, it gives me extreme pleasure to release the New World translation.

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:52.540
Brother Nor was overjoyed to release a translation that was not tainted with false religion, that restored Jehovah's holy name to its rightful place, and it was translated by anointed brothers of Christ.

00:01:53.540 --> 00:02:04.540
Back then, most English-speaking people used the King James Bible. It used old-fashioned words like thee and thou, that were hard to understand.

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:13.539
The New World translation was so much clearer and it restored Jehovah's name to its rightful place seven thousand times.

00:02:13.539 --> 00:02:21.539
The same need existed in other languages too. So what began to produce the New World translation in additional languages?

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:25.539
It was a slow, painstaking process.

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:32.539
Some early editions of the New World translation were taking over 20 years to complete.

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:47.539
But since 1989, the governing body always assigns a team of translators who encourage each other to keep moving through the 66 books and over 31,000 verses.

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:55.539
When a translator learns that he has been assigned to work with a Bible translation team, he is overwhelmed.

00:02:55.539 --> 00:03:00.539
One said, I couldn't sleep for many nights, I even had nightmares.

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:10.539
It is a tremendous challenge to fully understand the meaning of every part of the text before he starts translation.

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:25.539
Imagine trying to replicate a food recipe, but you do not have the original ingredients. You need to use substitutes, but still create the same taste and flavor.

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:33.539
Translating the Bible is something like that. You cannot use the original ingredients, the Hebrew and Greek words.

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:42.539
However, using the words in your language, you want to recreate the same meaning and emotional impact as the original verse.

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:54.539
The governing body recognizes what a responsible project this is, so they arrange specialized training to guide translators and to assure them of Jehovah's support.

00:03:54.539 --> 00:04:04.539
More than 130,000 questions from Bible translators have been answered in the past 30 years or so.

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:13.539
And these answers are not only provided to the teams that ask the questions, but to all Bible translation teams.

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:21.540
This approach made the translators work much easier, but the focus on Bible translation was about to intensify.

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:36.540
The governing body became aware of some difficult problems that some of our brothers were facing, particularly with certain language groups, you had just one Bible for a family or group or even for a congregation, and they had to share that one Bible.

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:50.540
In addition to that, some languages did have new translations of the Bible, they were available, but they not only took Jehovah's name out, but they replaced it with the name of a local deity.

00:04:50.540 --> 00:05:01.540
So back in 2004, the governing body decided to expand Bible translation work so that more and more languages could have the new world translation.

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:11.540
With the governing body's clear direction, Bible translation picked up speed. Then came the landmark 2013 annual meeting.

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:18.540
And we're pleased to announce at this annual meeting that the work on this revision recently was completed.

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:24.540
You don't have to wait at all. Here it is that revised edition of the new world translation.

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:39.209
We think you're going to find that this application is going to be the ideal digital companion to the Bible that you now have in your hand.

00:05:39.209 --> 00:05:51.620
The simpler 2013 English text sets a pattern for translators because it places greater emphasis on meaning rather than on words.

00:05:51.620 --> 00:06:00.620
Let's look at first Peter 5.2. I'm going to read it from the previous edition of the new world translation, and on the screen you'll see the revised version.

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:06.620
Shepherd, the flock of God in your care, not under compulsion, but willingly.

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:11.620
Did you notice anything different? Serving as Overseers has been added.

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:22.620
We never had those words in the new world translation before because the word translated serving as Overseers didn't appear in the Greek text that was used as a basis for it.

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:30.620
However, since then, an older copy of First Peter was uncovered, and it does contain the word.

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:35.620
It appears that the word was removed from some later manuscripts of the 4th century.

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:40.620
Why would anyone remove the word? Scholars have suggested a possibility.

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:48.620
In verse 1, Peter addresses the elders. And then in verse 2, he calls them Overseers.

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:55.620
That proves that the same person can be both an elder and an Overseer. The Catholic Church disagrees.

00:06:55.620 --> 00:07:01.620
In the Catholic Church, an elder is equated with a priest and an Overseer is much more important.

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:07.620
He's equated with a bishop and to them a priest, a lonely priest, can't also be a bishop.

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:15.620
So when the Catholic copyists came to verses 1 and 2, they must have thought that the church couldn't be wrong, so the Bible must be wrong.

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:18.620
And they took it out.

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:25.620
Did Jehovah's people hear if there's a difference between what we believe and what the Bible says, we will change.

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:27.620
We leave the Bible alone.

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:34.620
When I think back to the very evening when I realized that I have been given the truth, I recall thinking to myself,

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:41.620
Jehovah's witnesses have the truth, and so they must have the very best Bible translation.

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:47.620
And so that was the first thing I asked for. I wanted my own copy of the New World Translation.

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:53.620
And so now, when I have the privilege to release a new language edition of the New World Translation,

00:07:53.620 --> 00:08:00.620
and I see the joy on the faces of the friends, I can connect directly to that because that's exactly how I felt.

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:04.620
I just love releasing the New World Translation in another language.

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:12.620
Sometimes it's very exciting because the brothers don't think they're able to even receive the printed copy in time for the release.

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:19.620
In a couple of cases, they received the shipment of the Bible just the day before the release talk.

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:27.620
See, you can imagine, the brothers were totally excited, and then when they received it, that excitement was really enhanced.

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:36.620
The day I had the privilege to release the evade New World Translation in Ghana, we traveled to the assembly hall for the program.

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:44.620
As we neared the assembly hall, here there were many people with little stands alongside the road trying to sell things to the brothers.

00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:50.620
Many were selling Bibles because our brothers did not have the New World Translation.

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:59.620
It made me so happy to think that this was the last day our brothers would be forced to buy an inferior quality Bible translation.

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:05.620
Now, they would have the New World Translation.

00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:13.620
Every copy of the New World Translation that is printed or downloaded has the potential to change someone's life.

00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:18.620
Out preaching and teaching work is more important than ever.

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:21.620
Jehovah provides the tools we need.

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:27.620
As we use them, we make Bible truths widely available in hundreds of languages.

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:32.620
We help people to understand the truth and let it reach their hearts.

00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:38.620
Thus, in a mighty way, the word of Jehovah keeps growing and prevailing.
