WEBVTT

00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.019
Welcome to this month's edition of JW Broadcasting.

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:08.019
Here are just a few highlights that we have in store for you.

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:13.019
Do you feel that you've missed past opportunities to do more for Jehovah?

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.019
Or do you feel that your age or present circumstances keep you from reaching out?

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:23.019
We'll see how one couple learned that there may be doors of activity available

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:26.019
to those with a willing spirit.

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:30.019
Have you ever received an assignment that you felt was overwhelming?

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:34.020
Brother and sister Hollimey serving in West Africa

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.020
will share what helped them accept such an assignment

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.020
and remain spiritually strong through difficult times.

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:47.020
And if you're a regular pioneer, what role do you have in strengthening the congregation?

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:51.020
You'll find this dramatization very insightful.

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:59.020
Our focus is on our ministry in this May 2018 edition of JW Broadcasting.

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:21.609
To set this stage for the experiences in our program,

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:24.609
I'd like to talk to you for a few minutes on the theme,

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:28.609
Invigorate your ministry, how?

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:32.609
You dear brothers and sisters are having a regular share in the preaching work

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:35.609
and just think of the results.

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:40.609
Each year, about two billion hours are spent in the ministry.

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:43.609
Millions of Bible studies are conducted

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:47.609
and those being baptized number into the hundreds of thousands.

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:53.609
If you are a kingdom publisher, you have had a share in those thrilling statistics.

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:59.609
But there's a potential danger with so much to do in our life,

00:01:59.609 --> 00:02:05.609
not just in the ministry, but also with secular work, family responsibilities,

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:10.610
for some even health issues, we can get into a rut.

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.610
It's not always easy to detect it first,

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.610
because in this age of technology, we always feel busy.

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.610
But what consumes our day?

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:27.610
Watch this one minute video and try to detect what's going on in the life of one brother.

00:02:27.610 --> 00:03:05.539
His life is in a rut. Try to figure out why.

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:49.740
Would you say that this brother's life is in a rut?

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:53.740
Oh, he's active all day. He always has something to do.

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:58.740
But it says if his mind has been kidnapped by his devices.

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:02.740
Have you ever had the experience of reading an email

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:05.740
while someone is trying to tell you something?

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:09.740
It can be embarrassing when you realize that they've asked you a question

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:11.740
and they're waiting for an answer,

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:15.740
but you have no idea what they asked. It's embarrassing, right?

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:21.740
But what if the person who is trying to speak to you is Jehovah?

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:24.740
Even though we aren't doing anything wrong,

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.740
our daily routine can occupy our attention so much

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:34.740
that we are not able to hear the refreshing words of Jehovah.

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.740
That can happen to any one of us.

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:40.740
Even our spiritual activity can get into a rut.

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.740
One Christian sister described it this way.

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:49.740
I would go out in service, go to meetings, study, pray.

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:55.740
But I did it all on automatic control, never feeling anything.

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.740
Have you ever felt that way?

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.740
Do you see all the happy servants of Jehovah

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:05.740
who's experiences appear on JW Broadcasting?

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:09.740
And you say to yourself, why can't I find that joy?

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:12.740
Why is my ministry in a rut?

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:15.740
Perhaps you feel like a remote control train

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.740
that goes around and around on a track,

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:21.740
working the same territory with the same partner,

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:24.740
saying the same thing at each door.

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:28.740
Of course, there's nothing wrong with being in a good routine.

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:32.740
But being in a rut can sap our energy

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:35.740
and take the joy out of our service.

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:39.740
We can even come to view our ministry as boring.

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:43.740
Of course, we feel invigorated when we get good results.

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:46.740
We meet an interested person going from door to door.

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:48.740
We're invigorated.

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:50.740
And an active person approaches the cart

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.740
and wants to get in touch with the local congregation.

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:55.740
We're even more invigorated.

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:57.740
We start a Bible study.

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:59.740
We're on top of the world.

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:01.740
I'm sure you'll agree.

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:04.740
All those outcomes are good reasons for joy.

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:08.740
The problem is that we're not always in control

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:10.740
of getting those outcomes.

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:13.740
In real life, we may spend an entire morning

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:17.740
in the door-to-door work without meeting an interested person.

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:20.740
We may spend months making return visits

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:22.740
without starting a study.

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:26.740
And once again, our ministry can get into a rut.

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:28.740
Now, don't misunderstand.

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:31.740
It's not that we're doing anything wrong.

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:35.740
But we're not getting the full joy out of doing what's right.

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:39.740
Of course, Satan would love it if our service to Jehovah

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:41.740
were to fall into a rut.

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:44.740
He would love it if we lost our joy.

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:48.740
If we lose our joy, we lose hope.

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:50.740
We lose strength.

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:54.740
And we might even begin to feel like giving up.

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:57.740
The point is, brothers and sisters,

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:01.740
if you feel that your ministry has fallen into a rut,

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:04.740
don't be discouraged and don't give up,

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:07.740
there are ways that we can invigorate our ministry

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:11.740
and serve Jehovah with renewed joy.

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:15.740
To illustrate that, maybe you've had the frustrating experience

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:19.740
of locking yourself out of your house or apartment.

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:23.740
Of course, with a key, opening the door is simple.

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:26.740
A locked door might seem like an obstacle,

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:29.740
but it isn't if you have the key.

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:33.740
And the same is true with invigorating our ministry.

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:35.740
If we've fallen into a rut,

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:39.740
if we've lost that feeling of joy in our service,

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:44.740
there are a number of keys that can help us unlock the door.

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:46.740
Let's look at one.

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:52.740
Open your Bible to 1 Corinthians chapter 16 verses 8 and 9.

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:54.740
Now, in these verses,

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:58.740
the Apostle Paul was presented with the key of opportunity

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:01.740
and he used it to open a door.

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:05.740
1 Corinthians 16, 8 and 9 says,

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:11.740
but I am remaining in Ephesus until the festival of Pentecost

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:18.740
because a large door that leads to activity has been open to me.

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:21.740
Here, the Apostle Paul found a key

00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:24.740
and it didn't require moving to another location.

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:28.740
In this case, the key was to stay where he was

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:33.740
but to take fuller advantage of an opportunity right before him.

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:37.740
Sometimes, the key to getting out of a rut in our ministry

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:42.740
is to take advantage of opportunities we have right where we are.

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:48.740
For example, have you considered auxiliary pioneering or regular pioneering?

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:55.740
What about learning a foreign language with the goal of helping a nearby group or congregation?

00:08:55.740 --> 00:09:00.740
Opening one door often leads to other doors of opportunity.

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:04.740
For example, a brother named Jacob wrote this,

00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:09.740
When I was seven, many of my classmates were Vietnamese.

00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:12.740
I wanted to tell them about Jehovah,

00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:16.740
so after a while, I made plans to learn their language.

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:19.740
For the most part, I learned by comparing the English

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:22.740
and Vietnamese editions of the watchtower.

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:27.740
I also made friends in a nearby Vietnamese language congregation.

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:30.740
When I was 18, I started pioneering.

00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:33.740
Later, I attended the Bible School for Single Brothers.

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:37.740
This helped me with my present pioneer assignment

00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:41.740
where I am the only elder in a Vietnamese language group.

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:46.740
Many Vietnamese people are amazed that I have learned their language.

00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:50.740
They invite me in, and often I can study the Bible with them.

00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:54.740
Some have progressed to baptism.

00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:59.740
The point is, our ministry is what we make it.

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:03.740
If we allow ourselves to remain in a rut, it will be boring.

00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:08.740
If we use our keys, if we take advantage of opportunities that present themselves,

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:13.740
we will invigorate our ministry and give it new meaning.

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:17.740
This doesn't always involve putting in more time in the ministry.

00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:21.740
It could mean that we simply make the best use of our time

00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:25.740
as Ephesians chapter 5 and verse 16 says.

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:31.740
In fact, there is a saying, don't work harder, work smarter.

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:36.740
The key to working smarter could be as simple as switching things up a bit.

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:43.740
For example, could we work with different publishers instead of the same one all the time?

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:46.740
Could we try a different approach to our presentation,

00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:50.740
perhaps making better use of the Bible or our videos?

00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:53.740
Could we engage in other aspects of the ministry,

00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:56.740
such as cart witnessing or phone witnessing?

00:10:56.740 --> 00:11:03.740
Could we use our time more effectively to reach people when they are most likely to be home?

00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:08.740
Here's something else we could do to unlock a door and invigorate our ministry.

00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:16.740
Open your Bible to Acts chapter 16 verses 9 and 10.

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:22.740
Now here the Apostle Paul found a unique way to unlock a door to greater joy.

00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:25.740
Acts 16, 9 and 10 says.

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:29.740
And during the night, a vision appeared to Paul.

00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:33.740
A Macedonian man was standing there urging him and saying,

00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:37.740
step over into Macedonia and help us.

00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:42.740
As soon as he had seen the vision, we tried to go into Macedonia

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:49.740
drawing the conclusion that God had summoned us to declare the good news to them.

00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:56.740
Notice, Paul didn't think of all the reasons he couldn't step into Macedonia.

00:11:56.740 --> 00:12:01.740
No, he took action as soon as he was presented with the opportunity.

00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:06.740
Paul unlocked the door to invigorate his ministry.

00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:12.740
Sometimes, we think that only those who are young can reach out to pioneer

00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:14.740
or to serve where the need is greater.

00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:17.740
But that's not always the case.

00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:22.740
You parents may be able to unlock a door of opportunity for yourselves

00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:27.740
and think of the example you set for your children when you do so.

00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:32.740
That's what a mother named Tara discovered.

00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:38.740
I started pioneering when my youngest daughter was in elementary school, she says.

00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:43.740
It was important to me that my children see me serving Jehovah

00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:49.740
to the best of my ability as I encouraged them to reach out.

00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:54.740
Tara's husband, Anthony, saw the effect that his wife's pioneering had

00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:57.740
and in time, he too joined the ranks.

00:12:57.740 --> 00:12:59.740
This is what he said.

00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:06.740
When Tara became a pioneer, it made an immediate impact on daughter's number one and number two,

00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:09.740
and they became pioneers.

00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:14.740
When I became a pioneer, daughters number three and number four followed.

00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:23.740
I wish I had pursued full-time service sooner as it made a huge impact on the spirituality of the family.

00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:29.740
I can relate to this experience because of the good example of my parents.

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:35.740
My mother was baptized in Canada in 1940 when she was 16.

00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:40.740
Jehovah's Witnesses had just been banned in Canada.

00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:45.740
Her father had already died and her mother was opposed at that time.

00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:51.740
The brothers had very little money, but they encouraged my mother to pursue spiritual goals.

00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:59.740
With that encouragement, she started pioneering in 1942 while the ban was still on in Canada.

00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:06.740
In 1947, she was invited to become a special pioneer in the province of Quebec.

00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:14.740
At that time, special pioneers were required to spend 200 hours each month in the ministry.

00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:20.740
With basically no money and no family support, she accepted that assignment.

00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:26.740
This picture was taken when she and her pioneer partner were boarding the train to Quebec.

00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:33.740
Whenever I see this picture, it reminds me of the intrepid spirit that my mother had,

00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:40.740
not being afraid to take on a challenging assignment, but putting complete trust in Jehovah.

00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:45.740
That spirit encourages me even to this day.

00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:47.740
My father has that same spirit.

00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:55.740
In the summer of 1976, when I was 11 years old, a new arrangement was announced at our district convention,

00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:58.740
auxiliary pioneering.

00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:04.740
You could be an auxiliary pioneer if you could devote 60 hours in one month to the ministry.

00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:09.740
The month of October 1976 had five weekends.

00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:15.740
My father encouraged our whole congregation to try auxiliary pioneering that month.

00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:21.740
So many brothers and sisters, including me, decided to get a taste of pioneering.

00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:26.740
It was a wonderful experience that I will never forget.

00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:35.740
Parents, your good example will help your children to have a living ministry of their own that they will love.

00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:42.740
Brothers and sisters, if you find yourself in a rut, there's no reason to stay there.

00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:50.740
We've discussed several ways to reinvigorate our ministry, and with Jehovah's help, we will be successful.

00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:57.740
Now, let's meet a few brothers and sisters who have expanded and invigorated their ministry.

00:15:57.740 --> 00:16:00.740
We're sure you'll appreciate their stories.

00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:05.740
Our first experience comes from Brazil, in South America.

00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:13.740
Cristiano and Joanna Suza found the key to invigorating their ministry in a congregation letter,

00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:19.740
encouraging individuals to apply for the School for Kingdom Evangelizers.

00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:24.740
What new blessings did they experience by reaching out?

00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:36.299
We had our own house, a certain amount of comfort.

00:16:36.299 --> 00:16:41.299
My husband had a stable job, and I was doing a lot where we were.

00:16:41.299 --> 00:16:45.299
I had Bible studies, I was already a regular pioneer.

00:16:45.299 --> 00:16:50.580
So I thought I was doing enough. It was fine to stay there.

00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:56.580
We often see the younger ones going to Bethel, going to serve as special pioneers.

00:16:57.580 --> 00:17:03.580
And once we reached our 40s, I thought that since we're getting older, we wouldn't be able to reach out and do more for Jehovah.

00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:11.579
But after a letter was read to the congregations, that was really the starting point for us to see that we could do more for Jehovah.

00:17:11.579 --> 00:17:16.579
When I heard that there was a school for couples up to 65 years old, I said,

00:17:17.579 --> 00:17:19.579
Cristiano, it's now or never.

00:17:19.579 --> 00:17:23.579
So immediately at the first convention that held a meeting for interested couples,

00:17:23.579 --> 00:17:29.579
we attended the meeting and realized that out of the requirements there was one that my husband didn't meet yet,

00:17:29.579 --> 00:17:33.579
which was two years as a regular pioneer.

00:17:33.579 --> 00:17:36.579
So I thought, why not?

00:17:36.579 --> 00:17:39.579
After the convention, I applied to be a regular pioneer.

00:17:39.579 --> 00:17:42.579
So we made plans to attend the school.

00:17:43.579 --> 00:17:50.579
But we didn't want to stay there waiting to be accepted, as there were no guarantees of being accepted in the same year in which we applied.

00:17:50.579 --> 00:17:54.579
We sold our house, and two weeks later we had sold all the furniture.

00:17:54.579 --> 00:17:58.579
So we made arrangements to serve where the need was greater.

00:17:58.579 --> 00:18:03.589
We took only what was necessary in our car.

00:18:03.589 --> 00:18:07.589
But what is necessary is always too much when you get to the territory.

00:18:07.589 --> 00:18:10.589
You realise you didn't even need everything you took.

00:18:10.589 --> 00:18:13.589
We were really excited because we knew the brothers were expecting us.

00:18:14.589 --> 00:18:21.589
There was a gas station that belonged to a brother, and when we arrived the whole congregation was waiting for us there to welcome us.

00:18:21.589 --> 00:18:22.589
Nine people.

00:18:22.589 --> 00:18:26.589
And that had a great impact on us because we could see the expression on their faces.

00:18:26.589 --> 00:18:28.589
It was if they were asking for help.

00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:33.990
They helped us a lot.

00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:39.990
I can only say that they helped us more than we helped them.

00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:45.880
Now they would be able to have regular meetings.

00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:50.880
The public talk every week, you know, we were in São Paulo and we had all the meetings.

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:55.880
But in these remote areas they need spiritual food from Jehovah so much.

00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:58.880
But there needs to be people willing to go and help.

00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:05.079
Then one day we had a wonderful surprise.

00:19:05.079 --> 00:19:07.079
A brother called me and said,

00:19:07.079 --> 00:19:10.079
Cristiano, have you checked your emails?

00:19:10.079 --> 00:19:14.079
We'd received a letter inviting us to the school.

00:19:14.079 --> 00:19:17.079
The school really is a gift from Jehovah.

00:19:17.079 --> 00:19:24.079
I've encouraged others I know to attend the school because you really feel how Jehovah cares for his organisation.

00:19:24.079 --> 00:19:29.549
And a small thing we can do is simply give our best.

00:19:29.549 --> 00:19:32.549
And the school helps us to do just that.

00:19:32.549 --> 00:19:34.549
Find out what is our best.

00:19:34.549 --> 00:19:40.119
We were assigned to a congregation called Itido Su.

00:19:40.119 --> 00:19:44.119
The brothers are very loving and we're really happy in our assignment.

00:19:44.119 --> 00:19:50.019
I do miss my house.

00:19:50.019 --> 00:19:54.019
It's nice to have your own house and not to have to worry about paying rent.

00:19:54.019 --> 00:19:57.019
I miss my hairdresser.

00:19:57.019 --> 00:20:02.019
But nothing compares to the blessings and the joy that comes from serving where there's a need.

00:20:02.019 --> 00:20:10.400
This joy helps us to combat any home sickness we feel and stops us from developing any desire to go back home.

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:14.289
In the big city everything's very rushed.

00:20:14.289 --> 00:20:17.289
I would only see my wife when I got home from work.

00:20:17.289 --> 00:20:20.289
I'd be tired and then also have to care for coronagational matters.

00:20:21.289 --> 00:20:23.289
So there wasn't much time for us to be together.

00:20:23.289 --> 00:20:25.289
Now it's completely different.

00:20:25.289 --> 00:20:30.289
We have much more time during the ministry, in the congregation, being together at home.

00:20:30.289 --> 00:20:36.269
So for us as a family it's been very positive, very good.

00:20:36.269 --> 00:20:41.269
We're not tired, we're not old in the sense of saying that we've got no more to give.

00:20:41.269 --> 00:20:44.269
We really believe we can do more for Jehovah.

00:20:44.269 --> 00:20:47.269
And we want to do more for Jehovah.

00:20:47.269 --> 00:20:50.269
The school is proof that he wants us to do more.

00:20:50.269 --> 00:20:54.269
We want to use our life to the full to serve Jehovah wherever he sends us.

00:20:54.269 --> 00:20:56.269
We're willing to go.

00:20:56.269 --> 00:21:02.269
We feel it's the only way to say a big thank you to Jehovah for everything he's done for us.

00:21:02.269 --> 00:21:08.269
The territory, school, the brothers and Bible students.

00:21:08.269 --> 00:21:10.269
We're better way to thank Jehovah.

00:21:10.269 --> 00:21:27.329
Do you feel the way that brother and sister Sosa felt that you've missed the chance to do more for Jehovah?

00:21:27.329 --> 00:21:33.329
They learned there were doors of opportunity accessible to them if they were willing to reach out.

00:21:33.329 --> 00:21:38.329
Their choice to make themselves available resulted in rich blessings.

00:21:38.329 --> 00:21:42.329
But did you notice when those blessings started?

00:21:42.329 --> 00:21:46.329
Before the school they chose to serve where the need was greater.

00:21:46.329 --> 00:21:53.329
This had a profound effect on them, deepening their appreciation for spiritual provisions.

00:21:54.329 --> 00:22:05.329
If you desire to enliven your ministry by means of theocratic education, consider ways you can prepare your heart before you attempt.

00:22:05.329 --> 00:22:14.329
The Sosa's example proves that even the road to expanding our ministry can be deeply satisfying.

00:22:14.329 --> 00:22:22.329
When we're faced with challenging assignments, Reliance on Jehovah is of utmost importance.

00:22:22.329 --> 00:22:26.329
In what ways can we show that Reliance?

00:22:26.329 --> 00:22:36.329
I have the pleasure of introducing you to a friend of mine, Shane Brady, who is presently serving along with his wife, Yolanda, at the branch in Finland.

00:22:36.329 --> 00:22:40.329
Brother Shane Brady and I previously worked together at the Canada branch.

00:22:40.329 --> 00:22:51.329
Shane has been involved in legally defending our brothers for the past 22 years in many countries, including Armenia, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan.

00:22:51.329 --> 00:22:56.329
Shane, it's good to see you. How are you doing?

00:22:56.329 --> 00:22:59.329
Doing very well. It's great to see you too, Mark.

00:22:59.329 --> 00:23:08.329
Shane, we want to ask you what have been some of the challenges that you've faced in accepting these assignments in various countries in the world?

00:23:08.329 --> 00:23:13.329
Well, there certainly have been a few challenges. One is frequent travel.

00:23:13.329 --> 00:23:18.329
Another is language. Each country that we assist has its own language.

00:23:18.329 --> 00:23:29.329
Some court cases are very stressful. And at times we've faced firsthand the hatred of our composers.

00:23:29.329 --> 00:23:35.329
Yes. And you know, Shane, in spite of all that, you and your wife have always been willing to go on these assignments.

00:23:35.329 --> 00:23:38.329
We appreciate your spirit so much.

00:23:38.329 --> 00:23:46.329
Is there an experience that you can share with us that would give us a taste of the kind of situations that you've had to deal with in these countries?

00:23:46.329 --> 00:23:56.329
Well, there have been many experiences. One experience that comes to mind a few months ago, there was a special pioneer, a case was started against him.

00:23:56.329 --> 00:24:02.329
And if the decision was negative, it could be, have very serious consequences for our work in that country.

00:24:02.329 --> 00:24:06.329
So we did our best to present a strong defense.

00:24:06.329 --> 00:24:11.329
But as the trial progressed, things didn't seem to be going so well.

00:24:11.329 --> 00:24:20.329
Last day of the trial, everything changed. We presented a motion and we asked the judge to terminate the case against the brother.

00:24:20.329 --> 00:24:30.329
Personally, I didn't think it would actually work. But one older brother that we worked with over the years, he always told us we need to give you hope of something to bless. And so we did.

00:24:30.329 --> 00:24:38.329
And the results were quite unexpected. When we made the motion, the judge turned to the prosecutor asked, well, what's your opinion?

00:24:38.329 --> 00:24:44.329
And to our surprise, the prosecutor agreed with our request. And he even went beyond what we asked.

00:24:44.329 --> 00:24:50.329
He said to the judge that the government official that started the case against our brother should be punished.

00:24:50.329 --> 00:24:54.329
Well, the judge agreed the case was terminated.

00:24:54.329 --> 00:24:59.329
When we were walking out of the courtroom, I looked at the other brothers with me and we all said the same thing.

00:24:59.329 --> 00:25:04.329
Like, what happened? Well, it was obvious. Jehovah had intervened.

00:25:04.329 --> 00:25:11.329
That's a wonderful shame. I wish we had more time to hear many more experiences. But could you just share at least one more with us?

00:25:11.329 --> 00:25:23.329
Sure. In another land, where our work is not recognized on the night of the memorial, a number of the brothers were arrested for so-called illegal religious activity.

00:25:23.329 --> 00:25:32.329
They were all convicted of trial. So we arrangements were made to appeal each of those cases. And they were heard before a different appeal court judge.

00:25:32.329 --> 00:25:41.329
What at first seemed quite negative, the loss of trial turned out to be an amazing result. Let me give you just one example.

00:25:41.329 --> 00:25:48.329
In one of the appeals as we were presenting the appeal, not not long into the case, the appeal court judge stopped us.

00:25:48.329 --> 00:25:54.329
And he began to ask us many questions about about the Bible, about what Jehovah's Witnesses believe.

00:25:54.329 --> 00:26:03.329
So for quite some time, we answered these biblical questions. And then the case continued. And then after some minutes, the judge stopped us again.

00:26:03.329 --> 00:26:15.329
And this time the judge said, I remember reading in the Bible, the judge said this, I remember reading in the Bible that Jesus said, if they have persecuted me, they will persecute you also.

00:26:15.329 --> 00:26:19.329
So we said to the judge, yes, indeed, that Jesus said that.

00:26:19.329 --> 00:26:29.329
And the judge asked, do you think that's the reason why Jehovah's Witnesses are having problems in this region? Well, what could we say but agree with the judge?

00:26:29.329 --> 00:26:35.329
But that wasn't the end of it. As the case continued, a few minutes more, the judge stopped us again.

00:26:35.329 --> 00:26:46.329
And this time the judge said, you know, I'm not sure if Jesus said this. It's in the Bible where he said, where there are two or three gathered together, there I am in your midst.

00:26:46.329 --> 00:26:58.329
But indeed, those are Jesus words. And the judge looked out at this old courtroom, which was filled with our brothers and sisters. And he said, well, Jesus must be in our midst today.

00:26:58.329 --> 00:27:11.329
We felt like breaking into applause. At the end of the court hearing, the judge ruled in our favor, acquitted the brother and the judges and all of the other cases were also acquitted our brothers. It was just a thrilling experience.

00:27:11.329 --> 00:27:28.329
That's wonderful. That's wonderful. And thank you so much for sharing those experiences. You know, despite the challenges that you've had to face, how do you feel about the way you and Yolanda have benefited from being involved in accepting these challenging assignments in various parts of the world?

00:27:28.329 --> 00:27:39.329
We have benefited in so many ways, Mark. Our relationship with Jehovah has has deepened. Certainly our trust in Jehovah has has been strengthened.

00:27:39.329 --> 00:27:47.329
And we've experienced firsthand the love of the amazing worldwide brotherhood. Could I just share one experience about that?

00:27:47.329 --> 00:27:49.329
Please, please do.

00:27:49.329 --> 00:28:00.329
Two years ago we were involved in a case where police had raided a congregation meeting in one country. They had brutally beaten the brothers, threatened the sisters. It was just terrible.

00:28:00.329 --> 00:28:13.329
Some weeks later, in the court case that continued or started against the brothers, the police brought against the brothers. During that court case, the police repeatedly tried to arrest me and another brother I was working with over two days.

00:28:13.329 --> 00:28:23.329
They were trying to arrest us. Even in the courthouse, they tried to detain and arrest us. And all this all through this, my wife Yolanda was watching what was happening.

00:28:23.329 --> 00:28:37.329
We know what was so remarkable was despite the brutal treatment our brothers and sisters had endured just a few weeks earlier at the hands of these very same police officers, those dear brothers and sisters came to our aid.

00:28:37.329 --> 00:28:46.329
They were like a wall of protection around us and they would not leave our side until the ordeal was done. It was love and action.

00:28:46.329 --> 00:28:54.329
So to answer your question, we have benefited in so many ways. We don't regret for a moment, accepting this thrilling assignment.

00:28:54.329 --> 00:29:05.329
Well, thank you so much, Shane. Please give our love to Yolanda as well. We appreciate the tremendous work that you're accomplishing and majorhovah's spirit continue to be with you.

00:29:05.329 --> 00:29:10.329
It's our privilege. We look forward to continuing to work with you, Mark.

00:29:10.329 --> 00:29:16.329
Well, now what if getting yourself out of a rut takes longer than expected?

00:29:16.329 --> 00:29:22.329
We're going to meet a couple from Italy who had the goal to participate in a special preaching campaign.

00:29:22.329 --> 00:29:32.329
These campaigns can be a life-changing experience for the publishers involved, pushing them sometimes far out of their comfort zone.

00:29:32.329 --> 00:29:43.329
However, the DJ Chintos faced trying circumstances that prevented them from participating, but they did not stop knocking on this door of opportunity.

00:29:43.329 --> 00:29:52.430
We live in a beautiful quiet town in central Italy between the sea and the mountains.

00:29:52.430 --> 00:29:56.430
We have many friends, some of whom are good cooks.

00:29:56.430 --> 00:30:07.279
We have been serving for some years in a Romanian language congregation and we preach to people who have moved to Italy to seek a better life.

00:30:08.279 --> 00:30:13.279
When we heard the announcement about the special campaign, we looked at each other and said,

00:30:13.279 --> 00:30:17.650
Let's go!

00:30:17.650 --> 00:30:28.059
A large door of activity was opening up to us, but there was a problem, my job.

00:30:28.059 --> 00:30:32.059
I would need a month's leave of absence and that would be difficult.

00:30:32.059 --> 00:30:41.059
We prayed, we did research, and during family worship, we decided that in order to participate, I would ask for a one-month leave from work.

00:30:41.059 --> 00:30:47.440
But Jehovah had something else in mind that would create the right circumstances for us.

00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:54.170
When I arrived at work the next day, I found an unexpected situation.

00:30:54.170 --> 00:31:00.170
Because of the failing economy, my boss gave me and some other employees a letter of dismissal.

00:31:00.170 --> 00:31:03.170
I was not at all worried.

00:31:03.170 --> 00:31:13.210
I trusted in Jehovah and I knew that this new situation would allow me to participate in the campaign.

00:31:13.210 --> 00:31:17.210
Participating in this campaign is a dream come true.

00:31:17.210 --> 00:31:26.519
We wanted to participate in 2013, but unfortunately things in life do not always go as we would like.

00:31:26.519 --> 00:31:34.849
We received some truly shocking news.

00:31:34.849 --> 00:31:38.849
My father had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.

00:31:38.849 --> 00:31:42.849
Emotionally, it was not easy.

00:31:42.849 --> 00:31:48.849
The tranquility we had dreamed and hope for was almost gone.

00:31:48.849 --> 00:31:55.849
The only thing that could help me at that moment was the hope for what Jehovah promises us.

00:31:55.849 --> 00:32:01.849
In addition to my father's death, I began to experience panic attacks.

00:32:01.849 --> 00:32:05.849
I was afraid of something that didn't exist.

00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:13.480
I was afraid of not being able to move on.

00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:18.480
The kind of emotion that leaves a lump in your throat and you can't even breathe.

00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:25.480
I realized that only Jehovah could help me feel the void that I felt.

00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:32.480
After a family worship, Fabio and I decided to turn in our regular pioneer applications.

00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:37.480
I felt Jehovah at my side, embracing and supporting me.

00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:41.480
In the end, they turned out to be the three most beautiful years of our lives,

00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:45.480
which also allowed us to participate in this beautiful campaign.

00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:54.849
In Romania, there are many isolated territories that local brothers cannot work due to the great distances to be covered.

00:32:54.849 --> 00:33:05.940
It is really exciting to reach many people by traveling on dirt roads that are often muddy.

00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:19.500
The people are generous, hospitable and genuine.

00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:39.019
They almost always invite us into their homes and are willing to talk to us.

00:33:39.019 --> 00:33:46.019
Talking to people who do not know Jehovah and who are still very much interested in doctrinal topics is really exciting.

00:33:46.019 --> 00:33:55.819
Experiencing firsthand a culture different from ours,

00:33:55.819 --> 00:34:00.819
seeing people who live a more simple life and trying to understand their needs

00:34:00.819 --> 00:34:03.819
is an experience that we will take with us.

00:34:03.819 --> 00:34:08.820
And it will help us to preach more effectively in our assigned congregation territory in Italy.

00:34:08.820 --> 00:34:20.579
Now we are stronger than when we left home.

00:34:20.579 --> 00:34:27.880
This experience has made us love the ministry even more.

00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:31.880
We look forward to returning to our home territory with renewed zeal.

00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:40.070
We are certain that Jehovah will guide us to further service opportunities

00:34:40.070 --> 00:34:48.039
in order to help others know his wonderful purposes.

00:34:48.039 --> 00:34:53.039
What blessings did this couple experience by staying focused on their goal?

00:34:53.039 --> 00:34:56.039
It brought them the joy of full-time service.

00:34:56.039 --> 00:35:02.039
Not even the threat of unemployment caused them to waver in their determination to participate.

00:35:02.039 --> 00:35:10.039
After the campaign, they returned to their home territory with a renewed energy and zeal.

00:35:10.039 --> 00:35:15.039
When we stay focused on Jehovah, even in the most trying of circumstances,

00:35:15.039 --> 00:35:21.039
it will strengthen our resolve to serve him faithfully.

00:35:21.039 --> 00:35:28.039
Youso and Paulina Halme, a couple from Finland now serving in Sierra Leone in West Africa,

00:35:28.039 --> 00:35:33.039
were invited to accept an assignment that seemed overwhelming.

00:35:33.039 --> 00:35:38.039
What happened when some of their worst fears came true?

00:35:38.039 --> 00:35:44.039
How did Jehovah provide the power beyond what is normal to help them to endure?

00:35:44.039 --> 00:35:49.219
Worrying doesn't help us.

00:35:49.219 --> 00:35:52.219
No need really to worry what could happen.

00:35:52.219 --> 00:35:57.219
Even if it happens, let Jehovah show how he can handle the situation.

00:35:57.219 --> 00:36:02.219
He can actually do it in ways you could never expect.

00:36:02.219 --> 00:36:05.219
We are Youso and Paulina Halme.

00:36:05.219 --> 00:36:10.219
We loved our assignment in Finland branch. We had a wonderful friends.

00:36:10.219 --> 00:36:16.219
Our families were very close. We had a time to be with them often.

00:36:16.219 --> 00:36:23.219
In 2014, we got the yearbook and that had an account of Sierra Leone.

00:36:23.219 --> 00:36:27.219
I was reading that account and I remember saying a couple of times to Paulina,

00:36:27.219 --> 00:36:33.219
this would be a tough place. After coming back from Gilead, I couldn't believe it.

00:36:33.219 --> 00:36:39.219
We got a letter saying that we have been reassigned to Sierra Leone branch.

00:36:39.219 --> 00:36:42.219
It was a huge change for us.

00:36:42.219 --> 00:36:50.219
Then what we did, we googled Sierra Leone and what we saw it was only about a civil war.

00:36:50.219 --> 00:36:52.219
That took place years ago.

00:36:52.219 --> 00:36:56.219
Ebola outbreak was starting in West Africa.

00:36:56.219 --> 00:36:59.219
Some of our relatives were worried about that.

00:36:59.219 --> 00:37:02.219
That was our first impression about the country.

00:37:02.219 --> 00:37:07.219
We were terrified and we couldn't sleep with just pray whole night.

00:37:07.219 --> 00:37:12.219
Really, with the reassignment our greatest fear was my father.

00:37:12.219 --> 00:37:18.219
He had been terminally ill about two years and we knew that at some point it will get worse.

00:37:18.219 --> 00:37:22.219
He would need more help and also use his mother.

00:37:22.219 --> 00:37:25.219
So are we able to travel back to Finland?

00:37:25.219 --> 00:37:28.219
It's so expensive and we didn't have savings.

00:37:28.219 --> 00:37:34.219
So although we have all those fears, after praying about it a lot,

00:37:34.219 --> 00:37:37.219
we just realized that we cannot say no.

00:37:37.219 --> 00:37:41.219
And we realized that this assignment is from Jehovah.

00:37:41.219 --> 00:37:47.219
Let's go there. Let's get to the work. Let's give our best to it.

00:37:47.219 --> 00:37:52.219
Then actually in three months, our greatest fear, it came through.

00:37:52.219 --> 00:38:01.219
It really happened that a user's mom called us and told us that a user's father's situation has changed.

00:38:01.219 --> 00:38:04.219
So we started immediately to check flights.

00:38:04.219 --> 00:38:09.219
And then the next call was that he had passed away.

00:38:09.219 --> 00:38:18.519
We were able to get flights, fly back to home and support my mother, help with the funeral.

00:38:18.519 --> 00:38:22.519
We were so happy when we finally got back to Sierra Leone.

00:38:22.519 --> 00:38:28.519
And now we thought that we can focus to our assignment and our work at Bethel.

00:38:29.519 --> 00:38:32.519
Then one day we got another Skype call from my father.

00:38:32.519 --> 00:38:37.519
And then he told us that he's diagnosed with extremely aggressive cancer.

00:38:37.519 --> 00:38:39.519
And he's in hospital now.

00:38:39.519 --> 00:38:43.519
And he asked us to come back to Finland for visits.

00:38:43.519 --> 00:38:49.730
We had a beautiful 10 days together with my father.

00:38:49.730 --> 00:38:51.730
But then finally he passed away.

00:38:51.730 --> 00:38:55.730
Yeah, that was really the lowest point in our life.

00:38:55.730 --> 00:38:58.730
That came out of the clue. We were not expecting it.

00:38:59.730 --> 00:39:02.730
We had two videos to take care of.

00:39:02.730 --> 00:39:09.489
So we were really thinking if we can continue in our assignment in Sierra Leone.

00:39:09.489 --> 00:39:14.489
At that time, one of our favorite scriptures was Isaiah 30-15

00:39:14.489 --> 00:39:19.489
that your strength will be in keeping calm and showing trust.

00:39:19.489 --> 00:39:23.489
And when we poured our hearts to Jehovah in prayer,

00:39:23.489 --> 00:39:28.489
we could so well see how Jehovah helped us to stay calm

00:39:28.489 --> 00:39:31.489
and have peace.

00:39:31.489 --> 00:39:34.489
And we got some good advice from much of brothers,

00:39:34.489 --> 00:39:36.489
not to make any quick decisions.

00:39:36.489 --> 00:39:39.489
So we put our trust to Jehovah.

00:39:39.489 --> 00:39:45.489
And we could just see that it was Jehovah's will that we continue in our assignment in Sierra Leone.

00:39:45.489 --> 00:39:52.489
The fact is that really the blessings always surpass any of the challenges.

00:39:52.489 --> 00:39:56.489
And we have come to love our assignment in Sierra Leone.

00:39:56.489 --> 00:40:02.489
Our brothers and sisters, they are so faithful in Sierra Leone despite their problems and challenges.

00:40:02.489 --> 00:40:05.489
They give a beautiful example for us.

00:40:05.489 --> 00:40:09.489
Being in the country where there's a lot of potential, a lot of work.

00:40:09.489 --> 00:40:13.489
You can have as many Bible studies as you can conduct.

00:40:13.489 --> 00:40:16.489
So it's just a preaching paradise.

00:40:16.489 --> 00:40:22.489
Going through these experiences, we are so happy that Jehovah is a writer of our story.

00:40:22.489 --> 00:40:25.489
And for sure, there's a happy end.

00:40:25.489 --> 00:40:28.489
If he wants to take you there, go there.

00:40:28.489 --> 00:40:30.489
See what Jehovah has in mind for you.

00:40:30.489 --> 00:40:37.920
And then you can really taste and see that Jehovah is good.

00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:39.920
Despite heart-breaking challenges,

00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:42.920
the hallmissar Jehovah's loving support,

00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:45.920
and they did not give up.

00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:48.920
When we extend ourselves for Jehovah,

00:40:48.920 --> 00:40:54.920
we can be confident that he will help us in good times and in difficult times.

00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:59.920
We learned that we are safe with Jehovah, come what may.

00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:03.920
What quality do you need to serve in a foreign land,

00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:06.920
like Brother and Sister Deja Chinto,

00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:08.920
or to face the fear of the unknown,

00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:11.920
like Brother and Sister Hallmay?

00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:14.920
We need courage.

00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:16.920
As was announced last year,

00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:20.920
courage is this year's regional convention theme.

00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:24.920
The drama presentation will focus on a Bible character

00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:29.920
that needed great courage to accomplish his ministry.

00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:33.920
It's our pleasure to present a preview of the drama,

00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:39.920
the story of Jonah, a lesson in courage and mercy.

00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:46.699
Popus is your prophet.

00:41:46.699 --> 00:41:50.329
I was a prophet.

00:41:50.329 --> 00:41:53.329
I tried to run away from Jehovah.

00:41:53.329 --> 00:41:57.329
But when is Jehovah ever asked a prophet to go to a foreign land,

00:41:57.329 --> 00:42:01.329
to preach judgment against it?

00:42:01.329 --> 00:42:03.329
Where about the people?

00:42:03.329 --> 00:42:05.329
The worship gods of war.

00:42:05.329 --> 00:42:09.119
What do you think they're like?

00:42:09.119 --> 00:42:16.730
So, what will you do now?

00:42:16.730 --> 00:42:21.480
You need to go back inside, Joanna.

00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:23.480
No, we can talk to Father.

00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:25.480
Joanna, I can't go to Nineveh.

00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:26.480
I just can't do it.

00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:28.480
You're Jehovah's prophet.

00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:30.480
Not anymore.

00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:34.369
Go home, Joanna.

00:42:34.369 --> 00:42:54.000
The depths of the grave.

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.000
I cry to you for help.

00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:10.190
Be kind of me.

00:43:10.190 --> 00:43:14.190
No doubt you eagerly anticipate this year's regional convention program

00:43:14.190 --> 00:43:18.190
held around the world starting this month.

00:43:18.190 --> 00:43:21.190
Many of the segments on our program thus far

00:43:21.190 --> 00:43:25.190
have featured some aspect of preaching in a foreign land.

00:43:25.190 --> 00:43:29.190
If current circumstances don't permit you to serve in this capacity,

00:43:29.190 --> 00:43:33.190
be assured that there's much you can do in your home territory

00:43:33.190 --> 00:43:35.190
to revive your ministry.

00:43:35.190 --> 00:43:41.190
For example, out of the over 100,000 publishers in South Korea,

00:43:41.190 --> 00:43:46.190
there are more than 40,000 zealous regular pioneers.

00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:52.190
What efforts have they made to reach more people in frequently work territory?

00:43:52.190 --> 00:43:55.190
Let's find out.

00:43:55.190 --> 00:43:59.190
I started pioneering less than a year after I got baptized.

00:43:59.190 --> 00:44:02.190
So I was eager to sharpen my preaching skills.

00:44:02.190 --> 00:44:05.190
I really wanted to share my hope with others.

00:44:05.190 --> 00:44:08.190
But it's so hard to meet people at their homes during the day.

00:44:08.190 --> 00:44:13.190
And even if we do meet them, it's not easy to start a conversation.

00:44:13.190 --> 00:44:18.190
Our congregation organized convenience store witnessing from 7am to 9am.

00:44:18.190 --> 00:44:21.190
So I thought this might be a good way to reach people

00:44:21.190 --> 00:44:25.820
and have meaningful conversations.

00:44:25.820 --> 00:44:28.820
But the thing is, I'm not a morning person.

00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:31.820
So getting up early was not easy.

00:44:31.820 --> 00:44:34.820
So I had to make some adjustments.

00:44:34.820 --> 00:44:40.420
I tried not to make plans or stay up late the night before.

00:44:40.420 --> 00:44:45.420
The sample presentations from our meetings were also very helpful.

00:44:45.420 --> 00:44:50.420
In the past, I hardly got the chance to open the Bible while I was preaching.

00:44:50.420 --> 00:44:54.420
But now, I have a few Bible studies.

00:44:54.420 --> 00:44:58.420
Even the time we spend traveling from one convenience store to the next

00:44:58.420 --> 00:45:01.420
is very uplifting spiritually,

00:45:01.420 --> 00:45:05.420
because we use that time to share our preaching skills and build each other up.

00:45:05.420 --> 00:45:08.420
Having a regular share in convenience store witnessing

00:45:08.420 --> 00:45:11.420
has allowed me to be more productive in the ministry.

00:45:11.420 --> 00:45:14.420
I feel like I'm progressing spiritually

00:45:14.420 --> 00:45:18.420
and becoming a better minister of the good news.

00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:22.420
On weekdays, I work to support my family.

00:45:22.420 --> 00:45:26.420
So I would usually go out and field service on the weekends.

00:45:26.420 --> 00:45:30.420
But it wasn't easy to find people at their homes,

00:45:30.420 --> 00:45:33.420
because they usually make plans and go out.

00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:37.420
And you know, it's hard to get excited about the preaching work

00:45:37.420 --> 00:45:40.420
when you're not meeting many people.

00:45:40.420 --> 00:45:43.420
I wanted to set a good example for my family,

00:45:43.420 --> 00:45:48.420
but I found it a real challenge to maintain my zeal for the ministry.

00:45:49.420 --> 00:45:53.420
So I began to regularly participate in evening witnessing

00:45:53.420 --> 00:45:56.420
on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Fridays.

00:45:56.420 --> 00:46:00.420
I usually get off work around 5 p.m.

00:46:00.420 --> 00:46:02.420
After a long day at work,

00:46:02.420 --> 00:46:07.420
it's not always easy to get dressed to go out in the field ministry.

00:46:07.420 --> 00:46:10.420
But I kept up with my return visits

00:46:10.420 --> 00:46:13.420
and had some really encouraging experiences.

00:46:13.420 --> 00:46:17.420
A young man I had been visiting accepted a Bible study

00:46:17.420 --> 00:46:19.420
and he's making fine progress.

00:46:19.420 --> 00:46:24.420
My children were able to see how much joy I get from the ministry.

00:46:24.420 --> 00:46:27.420
And so now, they too are able to give a bold witness

00:46:27.420 --> 00:46:31.420
in their own words, even in the face of opposition.

00:46:31.420 --> 00:46:35.420
I am very proud of my children, training and teaching them

00:46:35.420 --> 00:46:38.420
how to make effective return visits and Bible studies

00:46:38.420 --> 00:46:41.420
brings me great joy.

00:46:41.420 --> 00:46:45.420
We serve in a small rural town where many leave home early in the morning

00:46:45.420 --> 00:46:48.420
to work in the field and they return late at night.

00:46:48.420 --> 00:46:52.420
So it's not easy to find people at home during the daytime.

00:46:52.420 --> 00:46:54.420
And even if we do find them at their doors,

00:46:54.420 --> 00:46:58.420
it's not easy to develop a meaningful Bible-based conversation.

00:46:58.420 --> 00:47:02.420
Let alone make return visits and conduct Bible studies with them.

00:47:02.420 --> 00:47:06.420
After returning home from preaching at night, I would ask myself,

00:47:06.420 --> 00:47:09.420
did I have a meaningful share in the ministry today?

00:47:09.420 --> 00:47:12.420
It's a small rural town.

00:47:12.420 --> 00:47:15.420
So many people are concerned about what their neighbors would think

00:47:15.420 --> 00:47:17.420
if they talked with us.

00:47:17.420 --> 00:47:21.420
So even those who are interested in learning more about the Bible

00:47:21.420 --> 00:47:25.420
were reluctant to have Bible discussions with us.

00:47:25.420 --> 00:47:29.420
It was really unfortunate.

00:47:29.420 --> 00:47:33.420
We tried to figure out the right time to call on people.

00:47:33.420 --> 00:47:36.420
And we found out that many householders are more relaxed

00:47:36.420 --> 00:47:39.420
than willing to talk about the Bible.

00:47:39.420 --> 00:47:45.420
So if we visit them around 9 or 10 o'clock in the evening,

00:47:45.420 --> 00:47:48.420
I gave much thought on how I could help my Bible students

00:47:48.420 --> 00:47:51.420
have a regular intake of spiritual food.

00:47:51.420 --> 00:47:55.420
One of my students worked from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m.

00:47:55.420 --> 00:47:59.420
So I asked her if we can arrange to study early in the morning.

00:47:59.420 --> 00:48:01.420
She agreed.

00:48:01.420 --> 00:48:03.420
I often tell my Bible students,

00:48:03.420 --> 00:48:08.420
just call me whenever you have a little time to talk.

00:48:09.420 --> 00:48:12.420
When I get those calls, no matter what time it is,

00:48:12.420 --> 00:48:17.500
it's time to rush out that door.

00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:20.500
There was one elderly lady who was in her early 80s

00:48:20.500 --> 00:48:24.500
who had attended church all her life.

00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:29.500
To accommodate her needs, I visited her around 9 or 10 o'clock

00:48:29.500 --> 00:48:33.500
in the evening for our Bible studies.

00:48:33.500 --> 00:48:37.500
I come home feeling tired and hungry,

00:48:37.500 --> 00:48:42.500
but the satisfaction of knowing that I've helped her learn more about the truth

00:48:42.500 --> 00:48:45.500
enables me to maintain my joy.

00:48:45.500 --> 00:48:50.750
Now I'm able to conduct about 12 Bible studies.

00:48:50.750 --> 00:48:54.750
I try to become all things to people of all sorts

00:48:54.750 --> 00:48:57.750
in order to look after their needs.

00:48:57.750 --> 00:49:01.750
And it brings me great satisfaction and joy to see my studies make progress

00:49:01.750 --> 00:49:06.750
because that's really how Jehovah wants us to be carrying out our ministry.

00:49:08.750 --> 00:49:14.539
You might feel that you've worked every corner of your home territory,

00:49:14.539 --> 00:49:19.539
but just like a literal fisherman adapts to the time when the fish are biting,

00:49:19.539 --> 00:49:22.539
we need to work when people can be found.

00:49:22.539 --> 00:49:26.539
Cast your nets into productive waters.

00:49:26.539 --> 00:49:33.539
Our sister arranged her schedule to call on her Bible student at 9 or 10 in the evening.

00:49:33.539 --> 00:49:38.539
Of course, we want to use good judgment to call it times that are both practical

00:49:38.539 --> 00:49:41.539
and safe for our territory.

00:49:41.539 --> 00:49:47.539
But by being adaptable to when, where or how we preach the good news,

00:49:47.539 --> 00:49:52.539
we may yield good results like our fellow witnesses in South Korea.

00:49:52.539 --> 00:49:57.539
This will help us to have a meaningful share in the all-important work

00:49:57.539 --> 00:50:02.539
of finding those who are rightly disposed for everlasting life.

00:50:02.539 --> 00:50:08.889
Regular pioneers work in a powerful way to help their brothers and sisters

00:50:08.889 --> 00:50:11.889
get the most out of their ministry.

00:50:11.889 --> 00:50:17.889
But does that mean that they're impervious to being in a rut, as mentioned earlier?

00:50:17.889 --> 00:50:22.889
In the following dramatization, see how one pioneer sister comes to realize

00:50:22.889 --> 00:50:26.889
the need to adjust her approach to the field ministry.

00:50:26.889 --> 00:50:46.019
It was really nice of Maria to invite me in service,

00:50:46.019 --> 00:50:51.260
but I already have plans with Sarah.

00:50:51.260 --> 00:51:04.780
We have similar service schedules, and we really enjoy working together.

00:51:04.780 --> 00:51:17.699
I try to get most of my time during the week.

00:51:17.699 --> 00:51:23.059
Anyone made plans to work together?

00:51:23.059 --> 00:51:26.059
Though I do meet with the group sometimes on Saturday.

00:51:26.059 --> 00:51:33.960
Sister Martin, thanks everyone.

00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:35.960
Anyone made plans to work together?

00:51:35.960 --> 00:51:41.659
Okay, Joanna, you can work with Sarah.

00:51:41.659 --> 00:51:51.019
Anyone made plans to work together?

00:51:51.019 --> 00:51:53.019
Could I work with Alicia?

00:51:53.019 --> 00:51:55.019
Uh-huh.

00:51:55.019 --> 00:51:58.019
Joanna, could you two work together, please?

00:51:58.019 --> 00:52:02.019
I'd love to, but I've just arranged to work with Sarah.

00:52:02.019 --> 00:52:04.019
I'm so sorry.

00:52:04.019 --> 00:52:06.019
No problem.

00:52:06.019 --> 00:52:08.019
Maria, could you work with this sister?

00:52:08.019 --> 00:52:31.780
While doing my Bible reading that night,

00:52:31.780 --> 00:52:38.780
I was really affected by the words found at 2nd Corinthians 6, 12, and 13.

00:52:38.780 --> 00:52:42.780
You are restricted in your own tender affections.

00:52:42.780 --> 00:52:44.780
Open your heart's wide.

00:52:44.780 --> 00:52:55.550
It struck me that some in the congregation missed out on a beautiful blessing

00:52:55.550 --> 00:52:58.550
by drawing away from the Apostle Paul.

00:52:58.550 --> 00:53:06.170
I realized I was limiting my joy as well,

00:53:06.170 --> 00:53:10.170
by not working with more in the ministry.

00:53:10.170 --> 00:53:13.170
I was going through the motions of pioneering,

00:53:13.170 --> 00:53:16.170
but I was stuck in the same routine.

00:53:16.170 --> 00:53:18.170
How are you, Maria?

00:53:18.170 --> 00:53:19.170
Good.

00:53:19.170 --> 00:53:20.170
And you?

00:53:20.170 --> 00:53:21.170
Let me ask you something.

00:53:21.170 --> 00:53:23.170
Could you join me on a Bible study Saturday?

00:53:23.170 --> 00:53:24.170
Oh, I'd love that.

00:53:24.170 --> 00:53:25.170
That's great.

00:53:25.170 --> 00:53:27.170
So later we'll make the arrangements, okay?

00:53:27.170 --> 00:53:28.170
Exactly.

00:53:36.250 --> 00:53:41.250
My student liked Maria and Isabelle so much.

00:53:41.250 --> 00:53:44.250
I really learned a lot from them.

00:53:44.250 --> 00:53:55.230
I started going out regularly on the weekends.

00:53:55.230 --> 00:53:57.230
Anyone made plans to work together?

00:53:57.230 --> 00:54:04.300
And working with different ones in the ministry.

00:54:04.300 --> 00:54:09.300
And I learned more about Sister Martin after one day in the ministry

00:54:09.300 --> 00:54:14.300
than I had in years of seeing her at meetings.

00:54:14.300 --> 00:54:18.300
Sarah and I still enjoy working together.

00:54:18.300 --> 00:54:22.300
But I found that by working with a variety of friends,

00:54:22.300 --> 00:54:37.619
my own joy has increased.

00:54:37.619 --> 00:54:41.619
I'm so glad I opened my heart wide.

00:54:41.619 --> 00:54:52.110
Joanna came to realize that her privilege of full-time service

00:54:52.110 --> 00:54:55.110
was more than just hours and a schedule.

00:54:55.110 --> 00:54:58.110
By working with a variety of sisters in the ministry

00:54:58.110 --> 00:55:01.110
and supporting her field service group,

00:55:01.110 --> 00:55:04.110
she could strengthen and encourage others.

00:55:04.110 --> 00:55:07.110
It was within her power to help,

00:55:07.110 --> 00:55:09.110
but with what result?

00:55:09.110 --> 00:55:12.110
It rejuvenated her ministry.

00:55:12.110 --> 00:55:17.110
We truly appreciate the love and sacrifice of our pioneers.

00:55:18.110 --> 00:55:22.110
Have you been inspired to make a change in your ministry?

00:55:22.110 --> 00:55:26.110
Whether big or small, at home or abroad,

00:55:26.110 --> 00:55:29.110
we can find the satisfaction that comes from

00:55:29.110 --> 00:55:32.110
re-envigorating our ministry.

00:55:32.110 --> 00:55:35.110
That's the theme featured in the music video entitled,

00:55:35.110 --> 00:55:37.110
I'm Making a Change.

00:55:37.110 --> 00:56:00.579
My serving Jehovah through the same routine.

00:56:00.579 --> 00:56:15.699
The things that I'm doing in a change

00:56:15.699 --> 00:59:43.929
are taking some changes along for trusting in you.

00:59:43.929 --> 00:59:46.929
The governing body deeply appreciates the work

00:59:46.929 --> 00:59:48.929
of each kingdom publisher.

00:59:48.929 --> 00:59:52.929
You dear brothers and sisters are having a regular share

00:59:52.929 --> 00:59:55.929
in the preaching work, and we commend you for that.

00:59:55.929 --> 00:59:59.929
You can be sure that God is not unrighteous

00:59:59.929 --> 01:00:01.929
so as to forget your work,

01:00:01.929 --> 01:00:04.929
and the love you showed for His name,

01:00:04.929 --> 01:00:08.929
as the Bible says at Hebrews chapter 6 and verse 10.

01:00:08.929 --> 01:00:12.929
Just knowing that can help us to take a fresh look

01:00:12.929 --> 01:00:15.929
at our ministry and can invigorate us

01:00:15.929 --> 01:00:19.929
to participate to the fullest extent.

01:00:19.929 --> 01:00:25.929
To conclude, we bring you greetings from Bosnia and Herzegovina.

01:00:25.929 --> 01:00:28.929
This mountainous region has a rich history

01:00:28.929 --> 01:00:31.929
as a traditional meeting place between Eastern

01:00:31.929 --> 01:00:35.929
and Western cultures dating from the Middle Ages.

01:00:35.929 --> 01:00:39.929
Because of the diverse religious beliefs within the country,

01:00:39.929 --> 01:00:44.929
the 1,160 publishers must adapt their preaching methods

01:00:44.929 --> 01:00:48.929
to appeal to the hearts of those who listen.

01:00:48.929 --> 01:00:53.929
This is the city of Mostar, which sits on the Neretva River.

01:00:53.929 --> 01:00:58.929
The Neretva River flows for nearly 230 kilometers

01:00:58.929 --> 01:01:01.929
or almost 144 miles.

01:01:01.929 --> 01:01:06.929
Mostar was a former front line during the wars of the 1990s

01:01:06.929 --> 01:01:10.929
and many buildings still bear the marks of the intense fighting

01:01:10.929 --> 01:01:12.929
that took place.

01:01:12.929 --> 01:01:16.929
Likewise, the aftermath left many people in this region

01:01:16.929 --> 01:01:19.929
with emotional and mental scars.

01:01:19.929 --> 01:01:22.929
Our brothers and sisters are working hard

01:01:22.929 --> 01:01:27.929
to bring the hope of something good to those in need.

01:01:27.929 --> 01:01:32.929
In the 1930s, a pioneer brother named Alfred Tuchek

01:01:32.929 --> 01:01:36.929
spearheaded the preaching work in the city of Mostar.

01:01:36.929 --> 01:01:41.929
He was actually one of the first in the former Yugoslavia to pioneer.

01:01:41.929 --> 01:01:46.929
Today, the congregation in Mostar has about 60 publishers,

01:01:46.929 --> 01:01:51.929
including nine pioneers and four field missionaries.

01:01:51.929 --> 01:01:56.929
They bring their warm love and greetings to all of us around the world.

01:01:56.929 --> 01:02:00.929
This is JW Broadcasting from the World Headquarters

01:02:00.929 --> 01:02:03.929
of Jehovah's Witnesses.
