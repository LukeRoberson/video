00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:06.320
the city of Rome.

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:11.400
This video depicts some key features of Rome, including apartment blocks, as they may

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.599
have looked in the Apostle Paul's day.

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:23.000
Seen here are one, the Via Apia, or Appian Way, two, the Circus Maximus, three Palatine

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:31.679
Hill, four, the Temple of Caesar, five Roman theaters, six, the Pantheon, and seven, the

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.359
Cyber River.

00:00:34.359 --> 00:00:41.079
The famous Roman Colosseum is not shown because it was not built until late in the first century.

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:46.600
Rome, the capital city of the Empire, was located on the Cyber River and was built on an area

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.640
that has seven hills.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.600
As the Roman Empire flourished, the city expanded.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.799
This is the Via Apia.

00:00:54.799 --> 00:01:05.340
Paul travelled on this road to reach Rome.

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:09.180
This is the Circus Maximus, the city's first circus.

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.140
It existed in Paul's day.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:22.310
Some Christians likely died in this arena.

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.230
By the middle of the first century CE, Rome may have had a population of around one

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:32.310
million people, including a large Jewish population.

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:39.390
This is the Cyber River and three of Rome's theaters, the Theatre of Mocellus, the Theatre

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.909
of Balbus, and the Theatre of Pompey.

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.670
Admittance to the theaters was free.

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.909
Events included debates, trials, musical performances, and plays.

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:56.750
The entertainment was at times violent and immoral.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:05.629
For good reason, Paul encouraged the Christians in Rome to abhor what is wicked, Romans 12-9.

00:02:05.629 --> 00:02:11.870
This is the Pantheon, a temple dedicated to the gods.

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.909
The first Christians in Rome, likely were Jews and proselytes who had been in Jerusalem

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:23.150
on Pentecost 33 CE and had heard Peter and the other disciples preach.

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:30.560
These new disciples would have brought the good news with them when they returned to Rome.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:42.699
This is the Temple of Caesar, built to honor Julius Caesar.

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:45.139
This is Palatine Hill.

00:02:45.139 --> 00:02:48.699
The city was apparently founded on this location.

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:57.819
Caesar Augustus had a palace here, and successive emperors expanded it.

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:04.620
The congregation in Rome was surrounded by political, religious, and immoral influences.

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.900
Even so, Paul wrote that the faith of those disciples was talked about throughout the

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.939
whole world, Romans 1-8.
