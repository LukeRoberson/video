00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:11.869
In the circuit work, we visit several poor communities in the city of Rio de Janeiro.

00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:14.869
One of the challenges we face here is security.

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:25.870
In these communities, there are a lot of conflicts and shootings between rival drug cartels,

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:28.870
and between gang members and the police.

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:38.070
It's common for us to see armed gang members when we're preaching.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.829
And often they're taking drugs.

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:45.829
When we're visiting the congregations in these communities,

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:50.829
the brothers really take care of us and don't let us out of their sight.

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:54.829
They're always thinking about our safety because we're not locals,

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:59.829
and it's possible that some gang members may not like us being there.

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:08.290
Most of these communities have a lot of steps to walk up and down.

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.290
And many of our brothers have physical limitations.

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:18.590
However, just knowing that our brothers are always close by

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.590
gives us the strength to continue serving them in the circuit.

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:30.099
All of these acts of love, whether large or small,

00:01:30.099 --> 00:01:34.099
really motivate us to keep working for Jehovah.

00:01:34.099 --> 00:01:40.340
We owe a lot to the brothers and sisters

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.340
for helping us get through all of these situations.
