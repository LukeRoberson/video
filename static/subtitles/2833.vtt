Cutsworth says, remember, then, your grand creator in the days of your youth before the days of your stress calm.

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:21.140
In the days of distress, they arrived early on Jared at 11.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:26.140
Jared was diagnosed with lymphoma cancer in the middle of 1991.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:38.140
We started trying to figure out how we could get him the treatment that he needed, of course, but in no way would we accept a blood transfusion and neither would Jared.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:45.140
But Jared was in the hospital, child protection services did investigate us. They were concerned there was negligence.

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.140
It was just adding to the pain.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.140
The way it turned out, they backed completely away from that.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.140
They realized we hadn't been negligent.

00:00:53.140 --> 00:01:17.140
So as we face different situations, we'd pray at the time not to have miraculous answers, but for Jehovah to open our eyes and to be able to find things and it seemed as though he was really directing us so that we could take care of ourselves spiritually through this situation as well as take Jared's medical needs.

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:24.140
I remember many times falling on my knees and praying and thinking this is it.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:30.140
I'm test to be on what I can bear and Jehovah would strengthen me.

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:36.140
And someone would come or they would say something and they fed us.

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.140
The brother made a schedule and he said, you're going to feed these friends.

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:48.140
And the brothers' instructions were, you don't bring it and just drop the food. You stay with those friends.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:53.140
It made me cry, the love, and the caring that we experienced.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:02:02.140
One time I remember the hallways of this hospital, 1,500 miles away from our home, started filling up with people.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.140
To me, that's answering prayers too.

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:15.139
It was hard for us to get out of the hospital. So they recorded talks. They would look us in the eye and they'd say, now you need to listen to this.

00:02:15.139 --> 00:02:18.139
It will keep you strong.

00:02:18.139 --> 00:02:27.139
Jared was worried about us and he made it clear. He was going to be fine. He just didn't know if we were going to be.

00:02:27.139 --> 00:02:36.139
He died in June of 1992. He was at home.

00:02:36.139 --> 00:02:50.629
And the last thing he said to us was, work hard so we can all be together again.

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:56.629
It's numbing because it's almost like you're living in nightmare.

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:05.379
Because you never think that those things all happened to you. But it did.

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:11.379
I didn't want people to see me cry. I didn't want pity.

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:21.680
I didn't. Because of that, those negative feelings, my imagination, were in wild.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:30.680
What helped me, I know was Gary putting into my heart and mind that this is a fight.

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.680
It's been a challenge for all mankind that if you make a heart on them, they don't love you.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:43.280
Satan said that about Jehovah and individuals. So I would be giving into that.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:49.280
The strong feelings I had and my sorrow almost made me stop.

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:55.280
I prayed a lot to go back to the kingdom all. The congregation cried.

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:01.280
They lost a little boy. It wasn't just Gary and Beth. They lost a little boy.

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:13.370
They cried. I didn't feel alone. We hugged, we cried together.

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:19.370
It really benefited us to get right back in the spiritual focus and get our mind up ourselves.

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:24.370
And I could have gave in to my pain and thought, well, I'm too heartbroken.

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:29.370
It made me have more joy because I realize that now they have all.

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:37.370
People around us were vital. The support system Jehovah has. And his word, his spirit.

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.370
Jehovah answered those prayers.

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:46.370
Our goal was really to stay in the full-time ministry. Maybe doing something else.

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:50.370
But we never, ever thought we would be in the circuit work.

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:58.370
But to have our daughter working with her husband in the circuit work, it's almost hard to believe it's happening.

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:02.370
We look forward to seeing Jared again having him back with us.

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:07.370
So I'm waning and I know I'm not going to be disappointed.

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:14.370
How encouraging to know that Gary and Beth are able to take vacation time to travel occasionally to see their daughter

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:19.370
and her husband who are also serving in the traveling work.

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:31.370
And did you notice how Gary, Beth and Jared felt Jehovah's loving support as they prayed throughout this heart-wrenching trial?

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:36.370
They asked for wisdom when seeking medical treatment for Jared.

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:44.370
Jehovah put his arms around them and listened when they felt overwhelmed with grief and negative feelings.

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:53.370
He strengthened Jared's hope in the resurrection and helped brother and sister-sector stay spiritually strong.

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:59.370
Can there be any doubt that Jehovah was answering their prayers?

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:09.370
Doesn't that strengthen our conviction that Jehovah will also answer Jared's prayer that they all will be together again?
