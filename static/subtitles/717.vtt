00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:12.980
The theme of my opening talk to you dear Gilead students, and really for all of us, is imitate Jesus' modesty.

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.980
Now, first, we ask, what is modesty?

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:29.980
Well, a common definition found in our publications is being aware of our own limitations, and Jesus, of course, set a perfect example in always being aware

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:48.979
of his own limitations. Undoubtedly, Jesus was very familiar with Jehovah's thinking on this quality, such as expressed at Micah's chapter 6 verse 8, which was written about 700 years before Jesus came to the earth, so he certainly would have been familiar with this.

00:00:48.979 --> 00:01:02.979
But if you recall, the question is asked, what is Jehovah requiring of you, and then part of the answer to walk in modesty with your God?

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:12.980
And there's an exclamation point after that expression. Jehovah would not just like to see it in us, he's requiring it.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:21.980
What is Jehovah requiring of you? Jesus knew it was not optional, but a requirement that we be modest in walking with our God.

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:31.980
Now, since Jesus is our perfect role model, let's discuss four areas in which we can imitate his modesty.

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:36.980
And we know that'll be helpful to you dear students, really for all of us.

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:57.980
Number one, Jesus was always aware that he had authority limitations. Now, you remember the account in Matthew chapter 20, when James and John tried to use their mother to get some special positions in the kingdom for them.

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:11.979
Remember, they had her ask her, say to Jesus, give the word that these two sons of mine may sit down one at your right hand and one at your left in your kingdom.

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:22.979
Remember that? But what was Jesus answer? To sit down at my right hand and my left is not mine to give.

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:31.979
But it belongs to those for whom it has been prepared by my father. Now, that's interesting. Jesus gave many gifts, didn't he?

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:43.979
He gave a lot of wine to a newly married couple at their wedding feast. He gave the gift of healing to thousands, probably. He fed thousands. He gave them food.

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:57.979
He gave a widow or son back after he died. But Jesus knew to give away the second and third highest positions in the kingdom was beyond the scope of his authority.

00:02:57.979 --> 00:03:02.979
And he acknowledged that very clearly, didn't he? Well, that's a fine lesson for us, isn't it?

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:09.979
There are many things that are within the scope of our authority. And we can go ahead and take the initiative and do those things.

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:23.979
See, but there are many other things that are outside the scope of our authority. For example, you wives. You know, there are many things in the family that have to be decided by the husband, not within your authority.

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:33.979
You brothers know there are many decisions that are made in the congregation that can't be made by you must be made by the body of elders.

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:51.979
We all know that in our Bethel department, there are many things required permission from our overseer. If some of you brothers here in our class end up later serving on branch committees, then you will need to clearly learn the parameters of your authority.

00:03:51.979 --> 00:04:00.979
See what you can handle and what really needs to be handled by the branch committee or maybe even taken to the governing body.

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:10.979
In areas such as the foregoing, all of us need to carefully learn what falls within our authority and what falls outside of our authority.

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:21.980
And if we're in doubt, it's better to check, isn't it? It's better to check if we're in doubt. We don't have the attitude. It's easier to get forgiveness than permission.

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:25.980
See, that's not a good attitude, is it?

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:33.980
Now, another aspect of Jesus having authority, limitations, open up to John chapter 12.

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:40.980
And here's an interesting thought that Jesus made John chapter 12.

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:58.980
In verse 49, he said, for I have not spoken of my own initiative, but the father who sent me has himself given me a command about what to say and what to speak.

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:04.980
Now, you could say, according to that, Jesus had speaking authority limitations, didn't he?

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:10.980
He had no authority to go beyond what his father had taught him.

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:16.980
He had no authority to teach others things that originate in his own mind and a heart.

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:22.980
He wouldn't go beyond that. He had authority limitations. Well, even more so in that, shouldn't that be true of us?

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:37.980
We have no authority to give our opinions on matters, but we have to make sure when we speak that what we say is solidly based on the scriptures and what's been provided by the faithful slave.

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:42.980
But now, let's go to our second area. We can learn modesty from Jesus.

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:52.980
He always remembered his lesser importance compared to Jehovah's much greater importance.

00:05:52.980 --> 00:06:04.980
How unlike Satan the devil, you could say he has not one modest bone in his spirit body, figuratively speaking, of course.

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:15.980
But no modesty in Satan the devil say, but Jesus refused to accept titles that belong to Jehovah. Why do you call me good?

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:23.980
Nobody is good except one God. He always gave the credit, the glory to Jehovah.

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:32.980
He said the son cannot do a single thing of his own initiative. But only what he sees the father doing. He never boasted.

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:48.980
He was always willing to put Jehovah's will ahead of his own will. He made the comment, father, if it is not possible for this to pass away unless I drink it, let your will take place.

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:58.980
And think about this. He had never tried to draw attention to himself by means of high sounding vocabulary or even by means of his dress and grooming.

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:07.980
See if he would have had some unusual dress or grooming, would you just have needed to kiss him to identify which one he was?

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:14.980
He could have said the one you're looking for is the only one in the group wearing a bright purple robe.

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:21.980
Or the only one in the group has a halibar mustache. See, he wouldn't have to kiss to identify.

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:30.980
And if you look at the pictures in our publications with Jesus in the 12th, it would be hard to describe which one he was.

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:36.980
He modestly blended in with all of the others. See, now what a fine example for us.

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:47.980
When others try to praise us, including our Bible students, we should modestly redirect that praise to where it belongs.

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:54.980
We should always give credit to Jehovah for what we accomplish. I mean, we accomplish it, but give Jehovah the credit.

00:07:54.980 --> 00:08:02.980
See, first Corinthians 4.7, what do you have that you did not receive?

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:08.980
If, in fact, you did receive it, why do you boast? There's, oh, you did not receive it.

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:16.980
And in the same harmony or same vein with that scripture, we try hard not to boast.

00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:24.980
Remembering Proverbs 27 to let someone else praise you and not your own mouth.

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:29.980
We do our best to put Jehovah's preferences ahead of our own preferences.

00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:39.980
We endeavor not to draw attention to ourselves by high sounding vocabulary or even immodest dress and grooming.

00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:43.980
But let's go to a third area we can learn modesty from Jesus.

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:51.980
He knew there are some things he was not entitled to know, at least not at the time.

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:55.980
Open up to Matthew 24, please.

00:08:55.980 --> 00:09:04.980
Now we're familiar with this scripture, but Matthew 2436 noticed Jesus' words concerning that day and hour.

00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:14.980
Nobody knows neither the angels of the heavens nor the Son, but only the Father.

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:23.980
Now think about it. If Jesus was content with having knowledge limitations concerning confidential things,

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:27.980
then even more so. Shouldn't that be the case with us?

00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:35.980
See, we should strive very hard not to ever try to get to know confidential things. We're not entitled to know.

00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:39.980
And we certainly shouldn't reveal confidential things.

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:43.980
And what a protection it is I was thinking for you dear wives of elders.

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:48.980
If someone asked you about a certain confidential matter, do you know anything about this?

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:52.980
Now if you know what you shouldn't, it's very awkward, isn't it?

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:59.980
You either got to be untruthful or you got to reveal that your husband didn't keep confidentiality.

00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:03.980
But if you don't know, that should be the case.

00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:08.980
Now with a clear conscience, you can answer that question with a resounding no.

00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:12.980
No, I do not know anything about that.

00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:20.980
You dear elders would not try to obtain confidential information in the congregation or at Bethel,

00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:31.980
you're not entitled to know. Like Jesus, all of us should be content to wait for information to be revealed to us at the proper time.

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:39.980
And if you think about it in some cases, it may mean that we will have to be content to never know certain things.

00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:44.980
Now let's get to our last area, this fourth area we can learn modesty from Jesus.

00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:53.980
And that is, he was always aware of his need to fully rely on Jehovah.

00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:59.980
Even though he was perfect, he did not rely on his own strength.

00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:02.980
Open please to Hebrews chapter 5.

00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:06.980
This is a beautiful scripture about this perfect son of God.

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:11.980
What is said about him, Hebrews chapter 5 verse 7.

00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:21.980
During his life on earth, Christ offered up supplications and also petitions.

00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:30.980
And notice with strong out Christ and tears to the one who was able to save him out of death.

00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:35.980
And he was favorably heard for his godly fear.

00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:44.980
And that interesting, during his life on earth, it didn't say just a few times, one or two times, during his life.

00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:49.980
He petitioned in his plural and he gave supplications again, plural.

00:11:49.980 --> 00:12:00.980
And what were the intensities of those supplications and petitions with strong out Christ and tears, he called for help.

00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:09.980
And Jehovah heard him say, if you think of the word outcry, that means a cry out loud, isn't it?

00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:14.980
A strong outcry, very loud to cry out loud.

00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:23.980
And then you add tears to that, it really indicates the intensity, how he really called on Jehovah to help him.

00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:26.980
That's an interesting thought, isn't it?

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:36.980
Additionally, when Jehovah sent Jesus, younger angelic brothers to come and help him in times of need, he didn't say, well, I don't need help.

00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:39.980
Privately, I'm okay.

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:41.980
I've got this.

00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:48.980
No, he knew he needed help and he graciously accepted that and appreciated that help.

00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:56.980
Think about this, even with Jehovah's help, he was modestly realistic of what he expected of himself.

00:12:56.980 --> 00:12:58.980
You ever thought about that?

00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:03.980
With Jehovah's help, he still modestly realistic, he could only accomplish so much.

00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:09.980
As an example, during his three and a half year ministry, he knew there's only so many he could reach, only so many people.

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:11.980
So why is he, what do you?

00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:15.980
He modestly trained and entrusted others to do the preaching work.

00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:24.980
And even said about them, as recorded at John 1412, that they would do works greater than his works.

00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:30.980
They would reach a greater number of people, a greater area, a greater period of time.

00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:41.980
Now, think about this, if the perfect Son of God feared to rely on his own strength, we should be scared to death to do that.

00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:44.980
We do not rely on our own strength.

00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:54.980
Never should we pridefully hold back from supplicating and petitioning Jehovah with strong outcries and tears.

00:13:54.980 --> 00:14:00.980
May we modestly accept the help Jehovah provides through our brothers and sisters.

00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:06.980
May we be modestly realistic of even what we expect of ourselves.

00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:15.980
If we imitate Jesus' modesty, these four areas we've discussed, what a protection it will be.

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:20.980
It will protect us from many snares of the devil.
