December 18, 2021 saw the fulfillment of what many deaf people in Germany had wished for.

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:19.539
Two complete Bible books, the Gospels of Matthew and John, were released in German Sign Language.

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:26.539
According to 1 Timothy 2 verse 4, Jehovah wants all people to come to an accurate knowledge of the truth.

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:31.539
Up to now, there were just individual Bible verses and a few videos in German Sign Language.

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:35.539
But often the entire context of a Bible passage was unclear.

00:00:35.539 --> 00:00:41.539
And that's exactly why the two newly released Bible books in German Sign Language are so valuable.

00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:47.539
A hearing person tends to think that just by reading a verse, the correct conclusion can be drawn.

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:49.539
But for a deaf person that is not the case.

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:54.539
For example, John 4 verse 36 mentions gathering fruit for everlasting life.

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:00.539
A deaf person now thinks a fruit can give me everlasting life. Where can I get that fruit?

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:06.540
Through the Sign Language translation, it's now much easier to understand that it's about bringing people to the truth.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.540
So that they can live forever and we as well.

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.540
It's always exciting for us to hear about the challenges people in our branch territory have to face.

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.540
And they are still able to get to know the truth.

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.540
When I was just 9 years old, I already wanted to become a nun.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.540
Because I thought that nuns are closer to Jesus.

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.540
I was always fascinated by Jesus, the Bible, and God.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.540
And I enjoyed looking at my children's Bible.

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.540
A friend of mine at school and her parents were very religious.

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.540
And they studied the Bible a lot. I liked that.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.540
Through her, I heard about the Christian Association of the Deaf.

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.540
And I also became a member of that organization.

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.540
They discussed a lot of things, but I didn't find any answers to my questions.

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:57.540
After I left that organization, it looked like I would never find the true path to God and his son Jesus.

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.540
In the door to door ministry, the brothers used books as a basis.

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.540
And then had to sign the individual paragraphs themselves.

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.539
A short time later, Jehovah's Witnesses came to my door.

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.539
I thought they had made up the name Jehovah themselves.

00:02:12.539 --> 00:02:18.539
When they showed me that God's name is in the Bible and that there is no such thing as hell,

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:21.539
I was very surprised and invited them in.

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:26.539
We talked for five hours. I was so relieved and wanted to know more.

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:30.539
That's why I started a personal Bible course with witnesses.

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:35.539
And I received answers to all my questions, exactly what I'd been looking for.

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:38.539
However, it wasn't all that easy.

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:42.539
The text was read and then signed. It was very tiring to follow.

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:47.539
But since I knew that this was the truth, it was worth all the effort.

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:51.539
It was also difficult later when I wanted to find out something for myself.

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:55.539
Ever since I was a child, I didn't like reading.

00:02:55.539 --> 00:03:02.539
There is no other religious organization in Germany that has published entire books of the Bible in German Sign Language.

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:08.539
With Jehovah's support, our team has put together a truly beautiful Bible translation.

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:14.539
This translation is reliable and dignified, exactly what we would expect of God's Word.

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:24.780
I'm so thankful to Jehovah and I was overjoyed as the two gospels, Matthew and John were released in German Sign Language.

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:30.780
I had searched long for answers and now Jehovah has given me this wonderful gift.

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:41.780
I can hardly wait to use the Bible in the field ministry and to show other deaf ones God's Word, not as text, but sign in their language.
