00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:09.080
Well, dear brothers and sisters, it is my very great pleasure to welcome you all for this graduation program of the

00:00:09.439 --> 00:00:13.759
142nd class of the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:28.399
We have a satellite locations tied in across the United States branch territory as well as our dear brothers in Canada

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:32.479
And of course in time we expect that this will also be shown to our brothers via

00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:37.719
JW Broadcasting. So what a large audience will benefit from our program today?

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:45.840
Well, you students are truly loved. I checked with the Bethel office just yesterday and found out that guests have come

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.679
from 40 different countries to be a part of this graduation program. Isn't that wonderful?

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:03.619
So we're very much looking forward to this spiritual feast that's about to take place.

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.780
So now if you're able let's stand and sing song number 54

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.379
this is the way and then following the song

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:19.140
brother Robert Butler a helper to the publishing committee of the governing body will offer our opening prayer song 54

00:01:19.620 --> 00:03:54.159
our marvelous god Jehovah

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:59.199
has the greatest and most far reaching vision

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:03.360
in Job chapter 28 and verse 24

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:11.520
we read for he looks to the ends of the earth and he sees everything under the heavens

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:17.120
well recognizing Jehovah's Almighty power and his perfect

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.920
penetrating vision

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:28.480
It's not surprising that the Psalmist prayed to Jehovah and expressed this in Psalm 119 and verse 18

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.680
Now notice this very beautiful and heartfelt request that the Psalmist made

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:36.319
He said

00:04:36.319 --> 00:04:43.680
open my eyes so that I may see clearly the wonderful things from your law

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:51.680
well now Jehovah has truly fulfilled this prayerful request in our day

00:04:52.560 --> 00:05:00.319
even though at 2nd Corinthians chapter 4 4 tells us that Satan the devil has blinded the minds of the unbelievers

00:05:00.959 --> 00:05:06.639
Jehovah is opening up the spiritual eyes of honest hearted ones

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:11.199
so that they can see the truth that's coming from his word

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:18.560
and it is truly amazing to see how honest hearted ones around this earth are receiving spiritual

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:24.879
sight from God just take this one experience in May 2015

00:05:25.839 --> 00:05:31.040
a Lutheran priest visited the Finland branch office with a pioneer couple

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:37.360
at Bethel she was deeply impressed with the warm loving atmosphere that she saw

00:05:38.319 --> 00:05:43.439
after a month she attended the imitate Jesus convention from Friday to Sunday

00:05:44.319 --> 00:05:49.680
her workmates at the church asked her to take good notes of the program and to share them

00:05:49.680 --> 00:06:00.800
which she did in December 2015 she visited the bishop and resigned from her office after 27

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:08.639
years of service as an active priest the bishop started to cry when she closed the door

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:15.439
after resigning she sent out this message i have just resigned from the church

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:21.120
now it is time for a new life under Jehovah's wise protection

00:06:22.319 --> 00:06:29.360
in January of 2016 she started serving as an unbaptized publisher and last year at the regional

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:36.879
convention she was baptized she's now serving as an auxiliary pioneer on a continuous basis

00:06:36.879 --> 00:06:43.120
and she says that she wants to have a share in public witnessing with carts close to the church

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:50.160
where she served for decades when i was in this interesting though this is the last comment

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:57.600
this dear sister mate she said as a young girl i made a promise to serve God but it wasn't

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:05.040
until now that i actually realized how God wanted to be served aren't we glad to welcome this

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:19.790
sister into our worldwide brotherhood but going back to that scriptural thought in Psalm 119 verse 18

00:07:20.589 --> 00:07:26.509
this is not simply the prayer of honest hearted ones who are in the world really brothers this

00:07:26.509 --> 00:07:35.550
is our prayer you see we all want Jehovah to open up our eyes and help us to see his word clearly

00:07:36.269 --> 00:07:42.910
now why is that so necessary for all of us well let's just take one simple example from the

00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:51.149
scriptures of the faithful man Samuel now Samuel was obviously a very spiritual man he was a person

00:07:51.149 --> 00:07:56.430
that was used throughout his life in Jehovah's service but if you look at this account in first

00:07:56.430 --> 00:08:04.750
Samuel chapter 16 you'll remember that here uh Jehovah was sending Samuel to anoint one of the

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:11.069
sons of Jesse to become king now if you look at verse 7 look what Jehovah says to Samuel

00:08:11.709 --> 00:08:22.670
do not pay attention to his appearance and how tall he is for i have rejected him for the way

00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:31.790
man sees is not the way God sees because mere man sees what appears to the eyes but Jehovah sees

00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:38.269
into the heart well now do you see the point do you see why we need to beg Jehovah to open our

00:08:38.269 --> 00:08:45.070
eyes and help us to see clearly his word you see our imperfection affects our vision doesn't it

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:55.789
our culture the way we were raised our fleshly inclinations can all distort our vision we so much

00:08:55.789 --> 00:09:04.429
need Jehovah God to open our eyes and help us so that we can see matters clearly well for the past

00:09:04.429 --> 00:09:12.110
74 years Gilead school has been a wonderful tool to help find spiritual men and women

00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:19.950
to focus and sharpen their spiritual vision now during your five and a half months of schooling

00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:27.789
you've had the pleasure to study God's word now this has not been just a dry academic exercise but

00:09:27.789 --> 00:09:34.909
really what you've done is you focused a light upon God's word the Bible now we're not talking

00:09:34.909 --> 00:09:41.470
about a little flashlight we're talking about a flood light and what has happened as a result

00:09:42.269 --> 00:09:49.629
well Jehovah has helped you to see yourself he's helped you to see the scriptures he's helped you

00:09:49.629 --> 00:09:58.269
to see your brothers he's helped you to see your assignments much more clearly through the enlightening

00:09:58.269 --> 00:10:06.110
influence of his precious word the Bible well as a result of all of that you are no longer the people

00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:14.669
you were when you arrived at Gilead you have changed but now what are you going to do with this

00:10:14.669 --> 00:10:21.389
wonderful gift that you have been given by Jehovah this expanded spiritual vision which has

00:10:21.389 --> 00:10:29.149
been extended to you well when you think about Gilead this school is something that is very close

00:10:29.149 --> 00:10:37.950
to our hearts as Jehovah's people it's tied up with our spiritual parents our spiritual grandparents

00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:46.909
with the foundation of the work in so many countries of this earth there is a wonderful spiritual

00:10:46.909 --> 00:10:55.789
legacy associated with Gilead well what do you want to do you want to become a part of that legacy

00:10:55.789 --> 00:11:02.909
you want to take the gift that you have been given by Jehovah and use it to strengthen and stabilize

00:11:02.909 --> 00:11:09.070
the congregations the fields the branch offices where you are going to serve and what a group

00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:15.950
you're going to join let me just give you some statistics at the present time Gilead graduates are

00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:25.470
serving in many fields of service for example 915 are serving as Bethelites 880 serve as field

00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:36.190
missionaries 496 serve as circuit overseers or wives of circuit overseers 244 serve as members

00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:44.750
of branch or country committees four serve as governing body helpers and two are members of the

00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:52.429
governing body well when you think of all of these individuals who are working hard to advance

00:11:52.429 --> 00:11:59.470
kingdom interests around the world how much we want to praise our magnificent our wonderful

00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:05.789
God Jehovah for what he's done by means of the Gilead school and by means of his organization to

00:12:05.789 --> 00:12:21.899
open our eyes and help us to see his word clearly don't you agree brothers well I'm sure all of us

00:12:21.899 --> 00:12:27.019
are looking forward to hearing where our students are going to be going but before we reach that

00:12:27.019 --> 00:12:33.100
part in our program it's appropriate that we hear a number of talks that are going to give

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:40.059
words of counsel words of encouragement even words of comfort that will build up not only

00:12:40.059 --> 00:12:46.139
the students but all of us who will hear this program first of all we're privileged to hear from

00:12:46.139 --> 00:12:52.220
a member of the governing body brother Stephen let he is going to speak to us this morning on the

00:12:52.299 --> 00:13:13.019
theme imitate Jehovah's use of memory brother let as you know Ephesians 5 1 tells us to become

00:13:13.019 --> 00:13:22.940
imitators of God as beloved children and if we think about it absolutely everything we can learn

00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:30.779
about Jehovah's worthy of imitation and that includes his use of memory as we will discuss during

00:13:30.779 --> 00:13:38.779
this talk but now first we ask what do we mean by memory well what encyclopedia says this

00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:49.980
memory is the faculty of the mind by which information is encoded stored and retrieved but

00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:58.299
unfortunately most of us struggle with remembering things we want to remember and not remembering

00:13:58.299 --> 00:14:05.659
things we would like to forget see we remember what we want to forget we don't remember what we

00:14:05.659 --> 00:14:16.139
want to remember it's a struggle isn't but if you think about it to illustrate this I can't remember

00:14:16.139 --> 00:14:22.940
where I left my glasses where did I leave my glasses but I do remember in detail how you

00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:35.419
offended me 20 years ago by the way when someone comes up to me at a convention or assembly and says

00:14:35.419 --> 00:14:43.899
do you remember my name I say well brother I remember your last name or I remember your first name

00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:55.340
but I don't remember your last name your first name is brother right well feel free to use that

00:14:55.419 --> 00:15:05.279
little trick if you want to but even though it is a real challenge for us as imperfect humans with

00:15:05.279 --> 00:15:12.799
imperfect memories to imitate Jehovah's perfect use of his perfect memory we should work hard to

00:15:12.799 --> 00:15:20.559
try to do so in fact we're going to discuss four ways in which Jehovah uses his memory that we

00:15:20.559 --> 00:15:27.679
would do well to imitate now the first one let's identify what it is and you dear Gilead

00:15:27.679 --> 00:15:33.919
students if you really work in these four areas it will help you in your assignments but now go to

00:15:33.919 --> 00:15:45.019
Hebrews chapter six please and let's read verse number 10 it says for God is not unrighteous so

00:15:45.019 --> 00:15:55.580
as to forget your work and the love you showed for his name by ministering and continuing to minister

00:15:56.059 --> 00:16:02.460
to the holy ones so you notice according to this scripture Jehovah does not forget he always

00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:10.539
remembers our love for him and our hard work in behalf of kingdom interest in fact the insight book

00:16:11.419 --> 00:16:19.100
an individual's record of fine works are like riches deposited with a creator in heaven

00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:27.179
so if you think about it every time that you go out in the ministry attend a meeting help build a

00:16:27.179 --> 00:16:34.139
kingdom hall unselfishly help someone in need it's like you make a deposit in that great heavenly

00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:43.899
Jehovah's memory and he never forgets it and he shows his appreciation how so well he remembers

00:16:43.899 --> 00:16:50.700
to hear our prayers he remembers to give us holy spirit he remembers to rescue us from anything

00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:58.220
that could harm us spiritually but now the question how can we imitate this first example of Jehovah's

00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:07.019
use of memory well as Jehovah doesn't forget our love for him our hard work we don't want to forget

00:17:07.019 --> 00:17:15.900
Jehovah's love for us and his hard work in our behalf he works so tirelessly you could say in our

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:21.660
behalf doesn't he as we said remembering our prayers giving us holy spirit helping us we don't

00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:27.180
want to forget that especially we want to remember all the times Jehovah's helped us in the past

00:17:28.059 --> 00:17:33.900
and we know he's not going to abandon us now he's going to help us now we want to be like David

00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:42.059
he said Jehovah who rescued me from the claws of the lion and the bear he is the one who will

00:17:42.059 --> 00:17:48.779
rescue me from the hand of this Philistine he remembered how Jehovah always helped him he knew

00:17:48.779 --> 00:17:55.259
Jehovah would help him now in extended application we don't want to take for granted the hard work

00:17:55.259 --> 00:18:01.579
and the love that others are showing for Jehovah and we want to from time to time commend him and

00:18:01.579 --> 00:18:08.220
support them the hardworking elders hardworking ministerial servants of pioneers parents trying to

00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:15.660
raise their children properly children trying to keep their integrity to Jehovah see take note of

00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:22.539
that remember that commend and support but now let's get a second way that Jehovah uses his

00:18:22.539 --> 00:18:35.099
memory let's go to Luke chapter 20 and verse number 28 or verse 38 it is it says he is a god not of

00:18:35.099 --> 00:18:44.380
the dead but of the living for they are all living to him now what do we learn well Jehovah completely

00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:52.700
remembers faithful ones who have died they're living in his memory and appropriately these ones

00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:59.660
are referred to as being in the memorial tombs because Jehovah's memory is involved now how can we

00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:05.819
imitate this example of Jehovah's use of memory well we don't want to forget these faithful ones

00:19:05.819 --> 00:19:13.180
who have died either and we have a lot of life stories for example in our publications to help us

00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:18.779
remember them and they're good qualities they're good examples that we can keep learning from for

00:19:18.779 --> 00:19:27.900
example former members of the governing body such as brother Klein other members of the anointed

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:36.220
or ones of the anointed sister Gertrude pet singer George Lindell Bennett Brickle ones that had the

00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:42.779
earthly hope life stories about them for the George couch Max Max Larson Robert Walent and of

00:19:42.779 --> 00:19:49.259
course the Bible as you know contains numerous examples of ones who have died that we don't want

00:19:49.259 --> 00:19:56.460
to forget we want to keep reading about them meditating on their example and learning from them

00:19:57.180 --> 00:20:05.180
well let's get a third way now that Jehovah uses his memory let's go to Joshua chapter 21

00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:12.140
and we'll read verse 45 Joshua 21 verse 45

00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:21.420
not a promise failed out of all the good promises that Jehovah had made to the house of Israel

00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:29.980
all of them came true now this scripture and several others shows Jehovah never forgets his promises

00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:39.740
he remembers them and he fulfills all of his promises doesn't he in contrast speaking of politicians

00:20:40.859 --> 00:20:48.299
one writer made a comment they promised the moon but once they get into office they do well to

00:20:48.299 --> 00:20:57.980
deliver a moon beam well others have what has been labeled selective memory or selective amnesia

00:20:57.980 --> 00:21:03.819
has been labeled see regarding promises they've made but not Jehovah and of course as Jehovah's

00:21:03.819 --> 00:21:11.019
children we want to imitate him remember our promises what promise especially our dedication promise

00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:21.980
in our dedication vow we promise to do Jehovah's will unreservedly we promised that we would put

00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:28.619
Jehovah's will ahead of our own will that's what we promised and what what is the duration of this

00:21:28.619 --> 00:21:35.099
promise this most important promise we ever made well forever what if we die we're resurrected

00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:41.579
well you're gonna have to get rebabtized when you're resurrected or rededicate your life

00:21:41.579 --> 00:21:50.539
did you know your dedication baptism endure even death and resurrection so he expects this to

00:21:50.539 --> 00:21:57.019
to fulfill that promise we have made now those of us that are married he expects us to fulfill

00:21:57.019 --> 00:22:03.259
our marriage vows maybe we've made other promises to Jehovah for example here at Gilead school

00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:12.940
you may have made promises to Jehovah well he expects us to remember and fulfill those promises

00:22:13.579 --> 00:22:19.339
but now let's get one more way a fourth way Jehovah uses his memory let's go to Isaiah 43 please

00:22:20.859 --> 00:22:29.740
and this scripture will help us identify it Isaiah 43 verse 25 Jehovah says I am the one

00:22:30.539 --> 00:22:41.819
who is blotting out your transgressions for my own sake and I will not remember your sins now very

00:22:41.819 --> 00:22:50.299
interesting when Jehovah forgives us in he refuses to remember he to recall it to ever

00:22:50.299 --> 00:22:57.259
hold that sin against the person say he chooses not to remember that sin the watchtower some years

00:22:57.259 --> 00:23:07.099
ago said Jehovah quote will never call to mind our forgiven sins now that's amazing use of memory

00:23:07.099 --> 00:23:16.619
isn't truly amazing why does Jehovah choose you could say to delete our forgiven sins well is it

00:23:16.619 --> 00:23:24.140
because he wants to make more room in his memory no Jehovah has unlimited memory doesn't

00:23:24.859 --> 00:23:32.859
he calls all the trillions of stars by name I have a hard time calling by name the some 20 commenters

00:23:32.859 --> 00:23:41.420
at the Monday night Bethel family watchtower study Jehovah remembers in full detail the billions

00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:48.859
who are in the memorial tunes so memory capacity is not the problem isn't Jehovah forgives

00:23:49.579 --> 00:23:59.339
and forgets because of his love and mercy but now how can we imitate Jehovah here well we want to

00:23:59.339 --> 00:24:06.859
work hard to freely forgive as Jehovah does but then we want to work hard to try to delete that

00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:13.819
forgiven sin from our memories how do you delete something from your memory well you refuse to

00:24:13.819 --> 00:24:22.460
replay it reveal it in contrast if you want to remember something you you do review it don't you

00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:28.380
like if you want to remember someone's name you you keep repeating that to yourself you want to

00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:35.339
remember a scripture a word in a language you're trying to learn on the other hand if you don't

00:24:35.339 --> 00:24:40.299
want to remember something you refuse to replay it you dismiss that thought like an immoral

00:24:40.299 --> 00:24:48.220
thought as an example the same way with forgiven sins we refuse to replay them we do our best as

00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:55.660
second Corinthians 10 five says to bring every thought into captivity make it obedient to the Christ

00:24:56.539 --> 00:25:02.779
well we have four ways Jehovah uses his memory there we've now discussed did you get them

00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:10.220
he remembers our love for him and our hard work in behalf of kingdom interest we want to

00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:16.700
remember his love hard work in our behalf and it by extension the love and hard work of others

00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:22.460
too he never forgets faithful ones who have died well we don't want to forget them either by means

00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:30.220
of the Bible by means of life stories we can remember these ones and learn from them three he

00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:38.539
always remembers his promises and fulfills them we want to do the same for he chooses not to remember

00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:46.859
completely forget our forgiven sins we want to work hard to do the same thing may we remember

00:25:47.819 --> 00:25:56.109
to forget you have to think about that well likely you can think of other aspects of Jehovah's

00:25:56.190 --> 00:26:01.549
use of memory that would be worthy of imitation in fact i'm going to give you students that as a

00:26:01.549 --> 00:26:08.910
homework assignment come up with some other examples of how Jehovah uses his memory that we can imitate

00:26:08.910 --> 00:26:18.910
and i'll get you started Psalm 103 14 says Jehovah remembers that we are dust now how can we imitate

00:26:18.910 --> 00:26:25.150
that aspect of Jehovah's memory now you're used to homework assignments you've had them for five

00:26:25.150 --> 00:26:35.869
months now you have another assignment but may Jehovah bless each of you dear ones as you strive with

00:26:35.869 --> 00:26:54.930
the help of Holy Spirit to imitate Jehovah's use of memory well we sincerely thank you brother

00:26:54.930 --> 00:27:02.210
led for that fine talk and you can be certain that we will remember it well next we're privileged to

00:27:02.210 --> 00:27:07.250
hear from brother saki mirei a helper to the writing committee of the governing body

00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:12.690
brother mirei is going to speak to us on the subject with the measure that you measure out

00:27:19.890 --> 00:27:30.210
we know that you as students truly appreciate the privilege to go through Gilead to learn so many

00:27:30.210 --> 00:27:38.369
things and during this time you have been given many things many gifts as it were

00:27:39.569 --> 00:27:48.369
and we know this scripture says every good and perfect gift comes from Jehovah

00:27:49.569 --> 00:27:58.210
but now how should we view this gift that you have received the Bible helps us in a very

00:27:58.210 --> 00:28:11.309
interesting way in Ephesians chapter 4 Ephesians chapter 4 and it says here in verse 7 now undeserved

00:28:11.309 --> 00:28:21.950
kindness was given to each one of us according to how the Christ measured out the free gift so it is

00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:32.670
a free gift we didn't earn it we didn't deserve it but nevertheless it came from the Christ and he

00:28:32.670 --> 00:28:42.269
measured it out to us very kindly measured it out to us now what is the purpose of this gift

00:28:43.230 --> 00:28:58.750
why did we get this gift he goes on to explain here in chapter 4 verse 8 that he turns these individuals

00:28:59.470 --> 00:29:08.509
that receive these gifts into gifts they become gifts of men and now we look at verse 10

00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:20.990
what is the purpose is so that he might give fullness to all things now Christ gives out this gift in

00:29:20.990 --> 00:29:31.549
many different ways many different manifestations of his gift for instance looking at verse 11 some

00:29:31.549 --> 00:29:39.950
apostles prophets evangelizers shepherds and teachers the purpose that each of these gifts

00:29:41.150 --> 00:29:49.309
will share what they have in order to help every member of the congregation if you look here

00:29:49.309 --> 00:29:56.509
on verses 12 and 13 we read from the last part of verse 12 to build up the body of the Christ

00:29:56.509 --> 00:30:05.630
until we all attain to the oneness of the faith and of the accurate knowledge of the Son of God

00:30:06.990 --> 00:30:15.710
to being a full grown man attaining the measure of stature that belongs to the fullness of the Christ

00:30:17.309 --> 00:30:25.549
this is wonderful isn't it just to think that Christ Jesus has given you this wonderful gift

00:30:25.549 --> 00:30:33.390
this ability to build up the rest of the congregation that is your obligation and your responsibility

00:30:36.930 --> 00:30:44.769
in 1st Peter chapter 4 and verse 10 an additional aspect about this gift is given to us

00:30:44.769 --> 00:30:53.970
let us read that 1st Peter chapter 4 and verse 10 it says to the extent that each one has received the

00:30:53.970 --> 00:31:03.730
gift use it in ministering to one another as fine stewards of God's undeserved kindness

00:31:04.769 --> 00:31:14.690
that is expressed in various ways so this is our opportunity to use this gift as a distributor

00:31:14.690 --> 00:31:22.930
an administrator of God's undeserved kindness but this gift is very different from a normal gift

00:31:22.930 --> 00:31:29.569
that we would receive why would this gift be different normally when you get a gift what do you

00:31:29.569 --> 00:31:39.390
do you look at this gift and you think I wonder what's in it I wonder if I'm going to like it I wonder

00:31:39.390 --> 00:31:46.750
how I will use it that's normally the case but with this gift we receive we receive the gift

00:31:47.549 --> 00:31:56.269
and we just simply give it on without opening the gift this is our obligation with this gift

00:31:56.269 --> 00:32:03.309
we've received Christ Jesus helps us to understand how to administer this gift and we turn to Luke

00:32:03.309 --> 00:32:25.410
chapter 6 verses 32 to 37 Luke 6 starting with verse 32 if you love those loving you

00:32:26.369 --> 00:32:33.250
of what credit is it to you for even the sinners love those loving them and if you do good to those

00:32:33.250 --> 00:32:42.369
doing good to you of what credit is it to you even the sinners do the same also if you lend to those

00:32:42.369 --> 00:32:50.690
from whom you expect repayment of what credit is it to you even sinners lend to sinners so that they

00:32:50.690 --> 00:33:03.009
may get back as much on the contrary continue to love your enemies and to do good and to lend

00:33:03.809 --> 00:33:13.329
without hoping for anything back and your reward will be great and you will be sons of the most

00:33:13.329 --> 00:33:25.650
high for he is kind toward the unthankful and wicked continue being merciful just as your father

00:33:25.650 --> 00:33:34.609
is merciful moreover stop judging and you will by no means be judged and stop condemning and you

00:33:34.609 --> 00:33:48.369
will by no means be condemned keep on forgiving and you will be forgiven so we cannot be judges

00:33:49.250 --> 00:33:57.809
of those to whom we give the gift we are not judges we are not condemning people our whole purpose

00:33:57.809 --> 00:34:04.450
of administering this gift that we've received is to do so without any prejudice

00:34:05.089 --> 00:34:15.570
we do not judge the worthiness of the recipient we only take on our responsibility our dignity that

00:34:15.570 --> 00:34:25.489
we have been given by Jehovah that of passing on the gift the second part apart from being

00:34:25.489 --> 00:34:32.449
completely unprejudiced the second part as we must give freely and generously now we get to verse

00:34:32.449 --> 00:34:44.289
37 excuse me verse 38 practice giving and people will give to you they will pour into your laps of

00:34:44.289 --> 00:34:55.409
fine measure press down shaken together and overflowing for with the measure that you are measuring

00:34:55.409 --> 00:35:06.369
out they will measure out to you in return so Jehovah God is extremely generous he makes the

00:35:06.369 --> 00:35:14.929
sun shine and the rain come upon righteous and the unrighteous and as Paul says he himself

00:35:15.730 --> 00:35:27.650
gives life and breath and all things to everyone and Jehovah is very interested in how we administer

00:35:27.650 --> 00:35:35.329
the gifts given into our hand that's why he says with a measure you measure out he is very

00:35:35.329 --> 00:35:43.570
interested to see whether we do so very carefully this is like the example of parents that train their

00:35:43.570 --> 00:35:49.170
children to make a contribution that the kingdom all they give the child a little bit of money

00:35:49.170 --> 00:35:53.889
and they tell him go and put it in the contribution box now he expects the child to go and put it in

00:35:53.889 --> 00:35:58.690
the contribution box right not to keep it for himself you doesn't also doesn't expect the child to

00:35:58.690 --> 00:36:05.250
collect all the contributions over a long period of time and then go make some big donation no

00:36:05.969 --> 00:36:11.090
the parents are actually giving the contribution and they expect their child to do it the way they

00:36:11.090 --> 00:36:19.409
tell them take it go and put it in the contribution box now and so it is with Jehovah he is giving us

00:36:19.409 --> 00:36:28.369
this gift that we need pass it on it is not for us to look and to hold onto this gift so here's

00:36:28.369 --> 00:36:38.369
the lesson be careful very careful that you do not control the gift that Jehovah gives you too

00:36:38.369 --> 00:36:47.250
closely remember the gift has to be passed on otherwise we will lose Jehovah's favor we cannot

00:36:47.250 --> 00:36:56.929
bury the talent in the ground as it were we receive it we must spend it as much as we treasure it

00:36:56.929 --> 00:37:04.690
we cannot hold onto it and so now we come to the key statement here with a measure you are

00:37:04.690 --> 00:37:16.539
measuring out makes us sons of the most high we cannot be more generous than Jehovah but does

00:37:16.539 --> 00:37:26.139
your generosity match the generosity of Jehovah in your case generosity has to become a habit for

00:37:26.139 --> 00:37:35.820
us a way of life and here's another very important aspect Jehovah's giving not just anything he gives

00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:46.300
the very best he doesn't hold back he gives us the very best let us read these most profound words

00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:59.920
in Romans chapter 8 and in verse 32 since he did not even spare his own son but handed him over

00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:07.599
for us all will he not also along with him kindly it gives us all other things

00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:18.159
so Jehovah gives it all principle for us with a measure we measure out it will be measured out to us

00:38:18.159 --> 00:38:26.800
this is an eternal truth we can count on it you've been given much don't hold back give it all

00:38:27.519 --> 00:38:36.159
give your best the benefit is not in using the gift the benefit is in giving the gift

00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:55.940
for with a measure you measure out it will be measured out to you and we thank you very much

00:38:55.940 --> 00:39:01.139
brother Marie for the beautiful gift that you gave us now we're looking forward to hearing from

00:39:01.139 --> 00:39:06.340
another helper to the writing committee brother Robert Soranco he's going to speak to us today

00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:18.800
on the theme is it all about you it is a rare privilege to be invited to attend the Watchtower

00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:26.559
Bible School of Gilead and and at 74 year history only about 9,000 students have graduated from

00:39:26.559 --> 00:39:32.719
this school well now at its current pace of two classes a year how long do you think it would

00:39:32.719 --> 00:39:41.679
take for all 67,000 special full-time servants in the world to be able to attend Gilead over 600

00:39:41.679 --> 00:39:49.679
years so we rejoice with you students for having been able to enjoy this excellent privilege

00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:58.559
but now we have to be cautious when we think about the word privilege one dictionary says it is a

00:39:58.559 --> 00:40:05.440
right that is given to some people and not to others so if not careful we could wrongly assume

00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:11.360
that receiving this or certain other privileges in Gilead's organization somehow elevates us

00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:17.840
above the rest of Jehovah's faithful servants and then by thinking that we could start to believe

00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:26.079
that it is all about us but is it the same dictionary says that privilege can also mean a special

00:40:26.079 --> 00:40:33.119
opportunity to do something and that is what we need to focus on whenever we receive a privilege in

00:40:33.119 --> 00:40:40.960
God's service the opportunity it gives us to serve there was an incident with Jesus Apostles at

00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:47.760
Nicely Illustrates this if you open your Bibles please to Matthew the 19th chapter Matthew chapter

00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:54.480
19 and keep your Bibles open there it was the year 33 of our common era just days before Jesus

00:40:54.480 --> 00:41:00.559
life in ministry would come to an abrupt end he and his disciples were traveling to Jerusalem for

00:41:00.559 --> 00:41:07.039
the Passover and a rich young ruler runs up to Jesus and asks what he has to do to gain everlasting

00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:12.559
life and Jesus explained but the wealthy man was dismayed when he found out that he would have to

00:41:12.559 --> 00:41:20.000
sell his belongings give to the poor and follow Christ well taking this all in one of Jesus

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:26.960
Apostles pointed out that they had given up their former vocations to follow Christ this is

00:41:27.039 --> 00:41:37.119
Matthew 19 verse 27 then Peter said in reply look we have left all things and followed you what

00:41:37.119 --> 00:41:46.480
then will there be for us in modern parlance Peter was asking what's in it for us well Jesus

00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:52.639
doesn't leave them wondering because in verse 28 he promises them that when he gets in his kingdom

00:41:52.639 --> 00:41:59.280
they eventually will sit on thrones with him and you can be sure that that prospect really stuck

00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:05.199
in their minds and they must have dwelled on it as they continued on their journey to Jerusalem

00:42:06.159 --> 00:42:11.360
but a short time later look at what happens in Matthew chapter 20 verse 20

00:42:13.519 --> 00:42:17.519
then the mother of the sons of Zebedee approached him with her sons doing obeisance

00:42:18.079 --> 00:42:23.119
and asking for something from him he said to her what do you want

00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:30.320
she replied to him give the word that these two sons of mine may sit down one at your right hand

00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:36.960
and one at your left in your kingdom well James and John probably put their mother up to that

00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:43.039
and how clever they must have thought they were that they got to Jesus with their requests before

00:42:43.039 --> 00:42:49.679
Peter or the others did and what was the reaction of the rest look at verse 24 when the 10 others

00:42:49.679 --> 00:42:55.280
heard about it they became indignant at the two brothers they were upset with James and John

00:42:55.280 --> 00:43:02.400
for trying to reserve for themselves the best thrones in the kingdom and they probably also wish

00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:10.000
they had thought the idea first well even before this we know the apostles had argued among themselves

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:17.199
as to which one was the greatest so do you see what their problem was it was all about them

00:43:17.599 --> 00:43:24.159
these 12 men already enjoyed the special privilege of having been chosen to be an apostle of Christ

00:43:24.159 --> 00:43:30.159
they were told of a future amazing privilege to sit on the thrones in the heavenly kingdom

00:43:30.159 --> 00:43:36.239
and now they're trying to secure something even more for themselves and what must have made this

00:43:36.239 --> 00:43:42.239
especially disheartening to Jesus is what occurred just moments before look at verse 17

00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:48.880
while going up to Jerusalem Jesus took the twelve disciples aside privately and said to them on the

00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:55.679
road look we are going up to Jerusalem and the son of man will be handed over to the chief priests

00:43:55.679 --> 00:44:02.239
and the scribes they will condemn him to death and hand him over to men of the nations to be mocked

00:44:02.239 --> 00:44:11.599
and scourged and executed on a stake with all that Jesus had on his mind preparing himself

00:44:11.599 --> 00:44:16.639
mentally and emotionally for what they had the last thing he should have been troubled with

00:44:16.639 --> 00:44:24.480
was the apostles posturing themselves for some sort of greatness but Jesus patiently took them

00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:32.480
aside to impress upon them the right attitude verse 25 but Jesus called them to him and said

00:44:33.199 --> 00:44:39.360
you know that the rulers of the nations lorded over them and the great men wheeled authority over

00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:46.079
them this must not be the way among you but whoever wants to become great among you must be your

00:44:46.079 --> 00:44:54.000
minister and whoever wants to be first among you must be your slave just as the son of man came

00:44:54.000 --> 00:45:01.519
not to be ministered to but to minister and to give his life as a ransom in exchange for many

00:45:03.119 --> 00:45:09.280
yes when Jesus came to earth it was to minister it was to serve others he was not aspiring to

00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:16.159
any positions of honor or prestige and Jesus disciples needed that same disposition they needed

00:45:16.159 --> 00:45:22.719
to appreciate that the greatest person in the kingdom must be the one who humbly serves others

00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:29.599
you see Jehovah bestows privileges on us not to give us some sense of entitlement

00:45:30.559 --> 00:45:36.239
but to create opportunities for us to be more useful in our service to God

00:45:37.119 --> 00:45:43.199
to show that Jesus really meant what he said notice what happened next and by now there within

00:45:43.199 --> 00:45:50.639
a day's journey of Jerusalem verse 29 as they were going out of Jericho a large crowd followed him

00:45:50.639 --> 00:45:57.199
and looked to blind men sitting beside the road heard that Jesus was passing by and cried out

00:45:57.840 --> 00:46:05.599
lord have mercy on a son of David but the crowd rebuked them telling them to keep silent

00:46:06.239 --> 00:46:10.719
yet they cried all the louder saying lord have mercy on a son of David

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:20.800
so Jesus stopped called them and said what do you want me to do for you they said to him lord let

00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:27.039
our eyes be open moved with pity Jesus touched their eyes and immediately they recover their

00:46:27.039 --> 00:46:34.719
sight and they followed him imagine again how much was weighing on Jesus's heart at that very

00:46:34.719 --> 00:46:41.199
moment you see he knew he was about to enter the final week of his earthly life that

00:46:42.559 --> 00:46:48.239
intense suffering and a cruel death awaited him and that his integrity to God was going to be put

00:46:48.239 --> 00:46:53.679
on the line and yet he does not ignore the insistent cries of these desperate men

00:46:55.360 --> 00:47:00.960
did you notice on verse 32 what Jesus asked the two blind men he said what do you want

00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:10.880
me to do for you now what might we be tempted to say if we see someone approaching us

00:47:12.239 --> 00:47:18.960
and wanting to ask a favor or our help for something well if we suspect that the request will be

00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:24.239
too distasteful or time consuming to fulfill we might want to reserve for ourselves the opportunity

00:47:24.239 --> 00:47:30.400
to delegate the task to someone else so we might just say what do you want but not Jesus

00:47:31.360 --> 00:47:37.760
and on ever so many occasions he was deeply moved to serve the needs of others because it was never

00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:46.159
all about him what a good lesson for us always to imitate you see we can approach life expecting

00:47:46.159 --> 00:47:53.519
to be a personal privilege or like Christ we can use the opportunities we are given to serve and

00:47:53.519 --> 00:48:00.079
whatever capacity we are allowed to do that in Jehovah's organization and for you dear

00:48:00.079 --> 00:48:05.679
members of the one hundred forty second class of Gilead we believe that you were already manifesting

00:48:05.679 --> 00:48:11.440
that Christ-like spirit in your assignment and that's why you were chosen to attend this one

00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:17.280
hundred forty second class of Gilead never lose that spirit now soon you're going to go off with

00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:22.320
diploma in hand aren't you maybe to take on even more responsibility than you had before

00:48:23.679 --> 00:48:29.760
and Jehovah has reserved a place for you to serve him in his organization we are confident you

00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:36.079
will remember it has not been all about you rather it has been about how you will use the fine

00:48:36.079 --> 00:48:44.480
education you have received now at Gilead as an opportunity to continually humbly serving others

00:48:44.480 --> 00:49:00.719
and for that Jehovah will richly bless you we thank you very much brother Sarenko for those very

00:49:00.719 --> 00:49:07.360
heartwarming and very meaningful thoughts well now we're going to begin to hear some comments and

00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:12.320
thoughts from the instructors of the Gilead school first we're going to hear from brother William

00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:22.659
Samuelson he's going to speak to us on the subject perfected into one some years ago back in the

00:49:22.659 --> 00:49:33.940
1700s Thomas Payne an American writer said it's not in numbers but in unity that great strength lies

00:49:35.300 --> 00:49:40.900
well that reminded me of a medical emergency that arose at a district convention some years ago

00:49:41.780 --> 00:49:48.820
a brother leaving the stadium got to the sidewalk and fell to the ground or to the sidewalk

00:49:49.059 --> 00:49:58.179
apparently with a heart attack or possibly a stroke two ambulances eventually arrived and the

00:49:58.179 --> 00:50:04.500
two drivers got into a heated argument over who had the authority or jurisdiction to transport

00:50:04.500 --> 00:50:13.219
our brother to the nearest emergency ward well what was it that kept these two drivers from being

00:50:13.219 --> 00:50:23.860
effective at their job was a lack of unity so thinking how can you promote unity in your job

00:50:23.860 --> 00:50:30.260
in your assignment that you'll be going to well there are many number of ways and the list that

00:50:30.260 --> 00:50:38.500
I'm going to give you is just three and it is by no means exhaustive good communication avoid

00:50:38.579 --> 00:50:47.460
promoting a personal agenda and if given oversight work within the boundaries of the assignment

00:50:48.019 --> 00:50:56.980
and work hard to be skilled at it good communication at the time of the emergency that I just

00:50:56.980 --> 00:51:07.380
mentioned an unauthorized person called 911 now that lack of communication the unauthorized

00:51:07.380 --> 00:51:13.619
person really should have communicated with the attendance already on duty assigned to that

00:51:13.619 --> 00:51:22.019
particular job there were EMTs there but he saw what he thought was a serious situation called 911

00:51:22.900 --> 00:51:31.219
now that resulted in 911 sending the second ambulance we'll talk about that a little later

00:51:32.179 --> 00:51:40.179
got to thinking about a Bible account a huge project that failed because of lack of communication

00:51:40.900 --> 00:51:46.980
now you probably think of any number and the one I'm going to talk about we usually think of

00:51:46.980 --> 00:51:53.300
in a negative way but turned to Genesis chapter 11 and we're going to look at verses six through

00:51:53.300 --> 00:51:57.940
eight particularly they won't read all of it but just a few little excerpts from it

00:51:58.500 --> 00:52:05.780
in verse five Jehovah went down to see the city and the tower the city and tower of Bable they had a

00:52:05.780 --> 00:52:14.659
project Jehovah said look they are one people they're united one language and this is what they've

00:52:14.659 --> 00:52:23.139
started to do now nothing that they have in mind will be impossible for them because they had

00:52:23.219 --> 00:52:29.460
communication they were able to understand each other so Jehovah confused their languages but now

00:52:29.460 --> 00:52:36.900
notice in verse eight he scattered them over the entire face of the earth and they gradually left

00:52:36.900 --> 00:52:49.219
off building the tower because they couldn't communicate the project failed well when we examine

00:52:49.300 --> 00:52:57.619
our own situation the scriptures tell us Paul wrote to the Philippians look out not only for your

00:52:57.619 --> 00:53:04.659
own interests but also for the interests of others how will you know what is in the best

00:53:04.659 --> 00:53:10.980
interests of others if you don't communicate with them if you don't talk to them if you don't

00:53:10.980 --> 00:53:16.579
find out what their preferences are they're thinking their abilities and once you find out what

00:53:16.579 --> 00:53:25.699
these are then you act in harmony with that and you look for their interests rather than your own

00:53:27.539 --> 00:53:36.739
the second point avoid promoting a personal agenda personal agenda was defined this way in one

00:53:36.739 --> 00:53:45.219
publication an ambitious scheme or plan of action designed to make things work out for your benefit

00:53:45.219 --> 00:53:55.219
or your convenience or so that you can gain control control seems to sometimes be a dominant thing

00:53:56.019 --> 00:54:03.940
well in our initial illustration or example our two drivers both had a personal agenda the first

00:54:03.940 --> 00:54:11.860
ambulance had been radioed for and was on site because it had been employed by the convention

00:54:11.940 --> 00:54:17.780
it was there for just such an emergency and obviously that driver felt that he had jurisdiction

00:54:18.820 --> 00:54:27.940
but you remember our unauthorized brother called 911 now 911 dispatched an ambulance and our

00:54:27.940 --> 00:54:34.179
brother had collapsed on the sidewalk so he felt because it wasn't inside the stadium it was on

00:54:34.179 --> 00:54:42.420
the sidewalk and because he had been dispatched by 911 he had jurisdiction so the two of them had

00:54:42.420 --> 00:54:47.780
their own agenda of course our four brothers laying here not knowing what's happening to him

00:54:48.739 --> 00:54:55.539
well I got to thinking about others in the Bible that have gone out for their own agenda Satan

00:54:55.539 --> 00:55:00.900
obviously tops the list he had an agenda he wanted to worship but what about Kora,

00:55:00.900 --> 00:55:11.619
Nathan the Byron if you turn to numbers chapter 16 8 down through 11 but we're not going to read

00:55:11.619 --> 00:55:19.699
all of that you remember the account in fact I think you studied it in detail but in verse 8

00:55:20.980 --> 00:55:28.340
Moses said to Kora listen please you sons of Levi does it seem to you such a little thing

00:55:28.420 --> 00:55:35.780
that the God of Israel has separated you from the assembly of Israel and allowed you to approach him

00:55:35.780 --> 00:55:41.619
in order to perform the service of Jehovah's Tabernacle and to stand before the assembly in other

00:55:41.619 --> 00:55:47.780
words you've been given a special privilege now does that seem like such a little thing to you

00:55:48.579 --> 00:55:55.619
in verse 10 he said so that you also must try to secure the priesthood well if you think about

00:55:55.619 --> 00:56:03.139
this matter of a personal agenda in your assignments you can contribute much to the unity of the

00:56:03.139 --> 00:56:08.659
group you're with the branch the department but if you start thinking about how this is going to

00:56:08.659 --> 00:56:15.219
give honor and glory to you you could start thinking about getting as much responsibility as you can

00:56:16.019 --> 00:56:23.300
working for your own interests rather than the interests of others getting or developing a personal

00:56:23.300 --> 00:56:31.139
agenda so in addition to the special privileges you have and full-time service must you also try to

00:56:31.139 --> 00:56:39.780
get something else try to get something greater two others that fell victim to this were James

00:56:39.780 --> 00:56:47.619
and John turned to the book of Mark and again we're just going to glance at a couple of

00:56:47.619 --> 00:56:52.659
the scriptures a couple of the verses here you remember and the brothers wrinkle already commented on

00:56:52.659 --> 00:56:58.260
this account and James and John and one kind of said they got their mother to do it but you know

00:56:58.260 --> 00:57:07.219
they knew Jesus knew he answered them and they said teacher verse 35 chapter 10 teacher we want you to

00:57:07.219 --> 00:57:14.019
do for us whatever we ask of you we have got a personal agenda we want to sit in your right hand

00:57:14.019 --> 00:57:20.099
and on your left we want to have honor we want to have authority you say we want this well without

00:57:20.659 --> 00:57:28.340
doing all of the details here verse 41 what did it do to the unity of the group of the 12

00:57:29.460 --> 00:57:36.980
verse 41 when the 10 others heard about it they became indignant at James and John

00:57:37.940 --> 00:57:44.659
yeah it didn't help the unity of the group with a personal agenda and so it is with you

00:57:45.539 --> 00:57:53.300
if you promote a personal agenda it's not going to help the unity of the department or the branch

00:57:53.300 --> 00:58:03.059
that you're serving with might think in conclusion of an illustration of an orchestra

00:58:03.539 --> 00:58:12.420
before a performance all of the instruments in an orchestra generally adjust to a single pitch

00:58:13.139 --> 00:58:21.139
one generated sometimes by an electronic tone generator now once they have been tuned to a single

00:58:21.139 --> 00:58:28.659
tone all of the instruments are automatically tuned to each other and so it is if you listen to

00:58:28.659 --> 00:58:37.219
the one tone you will all be tuned together you remember Jesus in his prayer to his father in

00:58:37.219 --> 00:58:46.340
John 17 before his death he prayed that they would be in union that they would be together as one

00:58:46.340 --> 00:58:55.380
if you turn to John 17 and verse 21 he said so that they may all be one in his prayer to his father

00:58:55.380 --> 00:59:03.139
just as you father are in union with me in other words in united one that they also may be in

00:59:03.139 --> 00:59:10.340
union with us so that the world may believe that you sent me but now drop down to verse 23

00:59:12.340 --> 00:59:20.420
in union with them and you I in union with them and you in union with me in order that they

00:59:20.420 --> 00:59:30.659
may be perfected into one now notice the footnote on perfected into one it says or be

00:59:30.659 --> 00:59:40.900
completely unified so for stability in the branch the department whatever your assignment is unity

00:59:40.900 --> 00:59:48.340
is a must has to be just as you've done for the past 20 weeks we encourage you to continue

00:59:48.820 --> 00:59:58.019
to work together united perfectly completely united perfected into one as Gilead graduates

00:59:58.019 --> 01:00:04.900
make sure you do your part to help your brothers and sisters become perfected into one

01:00:15.619 --> 01:00:20.820
we thank you very much brother Samuelson for those very practical comments I know the students

01:00:20.820 --> 01:00:26.099
are going to benefit from them well now we're looking forward to hearing a talk from another of

01:00:26.099 --> 01:00:32.500
our Gilead instructors brother Mark new mayor his theme for us today is see the cause

01:00:34.989 --> 01:00:42.429
well this is a time of great change of for Jehovah's people and you students have seen it firsthand

01:00:43.230 --> 01:00:48.909
by being invited to Gilead in fact some of you will receive a change of assignment

01:00:50.030 --> 01:00:57.550
after Gilead and still others might receive a change in their circumstances once they get

01:00:57.550 --> 01:01:04.510
back to their branch territory so change will be a part of your life and although change can

01:01:04.510 --> 01:01:12.909
be good many find unexpected change stressful or even unsettling we may find ourselves asking

01:01:12.909 --> 01:01:22.829
why me and that question is not a sign of weak faith rather it is healthy to ask why because

01:01:22.909 --> 01:01:32.269
when you ask the question why you usually begin to explore the cause behind the change

01:01:33.789 --> 01:01:41.550
now a careful study of Bible history reveals that Jehovah God is a master of change he loves change

01:01:42.429 --> 01:01:49.389
in fact when we studied the new world translation appendix a4 what did we learn we learned

01:01:49.389 --> 01:01:59.949
that Jehovah causes or sets in motion anything he wants to happen in order to fulfill his purpose

01:02:01.630 --> 01:02:08.429
now we might accept that Jehovah permits this or that when it comes to problems in this imperfect

01:02:08.429 --> 01:02:15.550
system of things and perhaps situations that ones go through because of imperfection true

01:02:16.510 --> 01:02:25.150
but what about when adjustments are made within Jehovah's Theocratic organization now what

01:02:26.190 --> 01:02:33.230
if we have a difficult time adjusting to a change because it doesn't match our thinking

01:02:34.429 --> 01:02:40.590
should we automatically conclude that Jehovah is simply permitting this change

01:02:41.070 --> 01:02:50.110
or is he in fact causing it to happen well I want to consider two Bible accounts with you

01:02:50.110 --> 01:03:00.960
that's going to help answer that question first one second Chronicles chapter 11 this setting

01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:07.280
is when the ten tribes withdrew their support from Rehoboam they made Jeroboam their king

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:14.800
Rehoboam wanted those ten tribes back no doubt thinking they have no right to break away

01:03:15.599 --> 01:03:22.239
who do they think they are in fact breaking away or splitting the 12 tribes would only create

01:03:22.239 --> 01:03:29.920
an abrupt change to a stable arrangement which originated with God since the days of Moses

01:03:30.639 --> 01:03:35.039
I want them back this was unexpected unsettling for Rehoboam

01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:45.920
and then Jehovah God sends his prophet Shemaya to Rehoboam second Chronicles chapter 11 let's

01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:54.940
read verse 4 this is what Jehovah says you must not go up and fight against your brothers Rehoboam

01:03:55.739 --> 01:04:03.900
each of you return to his house for I Jehovah have caused this to happen I have caused this to happen

01:04:04.059 --> 01:04:14.139
Rehoboam I have caused this split to happen Rehoboam I caused it and anything that I caused can only

01:04:14.139 --> 01:04:22.139
have good results it's going to be good I cause it it's going to be good and we too can discern

01:04:22.139 --> 01:04:30.539
the possible benefits of this split think about it individual Israelites in either kingdom now

01:04:30.539 --> 01:04:35.179
would have an opportunity to demonstrate if they would personally uphold true worship at the

01:04:35.179 --> 01:04:40.940
temple regardless of which king was ruling and regardless of which territory they lived in

01:04:42.539 --> 01:04:51.659
Jehovah's patience is mercy his protection will be magnified as he now dealt with two kingdoms

01:04:51.739 --> 01:05:01.500
instead of one but we may wonder since Jehovah caused this why did the apostasy occur afterwards

01:05:02.460 --> 01:05:10.380
well Jehovah intended this this split to be a mere governmental division in organizational

01:05:10.380 --> 01:05:15.820
adjustment not a departure from true worship as centered at the temple in Jerusalem

01:05:16.460 --> 01:05:24.940
if Jeroboam had continued faithful that separate kingdom of Israel would have continued right

01:05:24.940 --> 01:05:30.539
alongside the kingdom of Judah they would have worked together to honor and praise Jehovah God

01:05:30.539 --> 01:05:37.900
that would have been wonderful Jehovah would have made sure of that so Jehovah didn't cause the

01:05:37.900 --> 01:05:46.539
apostasy these problems or human flaws resulted when Rehoboam and Jeroboam failed to

01:05:46.539 --> 01:05:55.739
see that Jehovah expected obedience no matter where they lived that's the point they failed to

01:05:55.739 --> 01:06:03.179
cooperate with the new reality and reap the benefits from what Jehovah was causing to happen

01:06:03.179 --> 01:06:10.860
so what first lesson do we want you to think about to learn to have etched into your memory

01:06:12.699 --> 01:06:20.619
when Jehovah causes a change it can only be for the good all we need to do is cooperate with

01:06:20.619 --> 01:06:31.019
the change and see the cause or see what Jehovah is setting in motion and then look to him for a

01:06:31.019 --> 01:06:42.989
blessing on the outcome see this divine precedent teaches us that it is vital for you for me vital

01:06:42.989 --> 01:06:53.949
to distinguish the perfect cause of Jehovah from the imperfect flaws of humans who failed to

01:06:53.949 --> 01:07:03.710
cooperate with what Jehovah God is doing that's point number one let's go on to our second example

01:07:03.710 --> 01:07:12.269
this one has to do with Joseph the setting is when Joseph was in Egypt and he's making himself known

01:07:12.269 --> 01:07:27.360
to his brothers Genesis chapter 45 let's open our Bibles there chapter 45 verse seven notice what

01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:37.199
Joseph says to his brothers how he words this but God sent me ahead of you sent me ahead of you

01:07:37.199 --> 01:07:43.920
in order to preserve for you a remnant there was a purpose on the earth and to keep you alive by a

01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:51.920
great deliverance do we see that Jehovah didn't merely permit him to go to Egypt but he caused Joseph

01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:59.519
to go to Egypt I sent you I caused you to go ahead to preserve a remnant you see Joseph's arrival in

01:07:59.519 --> 01:08:07.039
Egypt was part of Jehovah's purpose in creating the conditions that would result in preserving the

01:08:07.039 --> 01:08:18.880
offspring that would lead to the Messiah however Jehovah causing a change at times the consequences

01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:26.079
of that change are not what we expect and that's what we have to think about he causes the change

01:08:26.079 --> 01:08:32.319
but the consequences might not but what be what we expect for example think about Joseph he

01:08:32.319 --> 01:08:40.399
becomes a slave didn't expect that went to prison I don't expect this I'm initially I'm treated

01:08:40.399 --> 01:08:49.279
severely I didn't like that see Joseph suffered many human injustices or flaws along the way

01:08:51.039 --> 01:08:58.640
now he could have easily resisted proudly reason now hold on here me a slave a slave the prophetic

01:08:58.640 --> 01:09:05.439
dreams I received as a young man indicated that others would bow down to me I don't see anyone

01:09:05.439 --> 01:09:11.600
bowing down to me I'm bowing down to others as a slave this doesn't make sense this is not turning

01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:19.920
out the way I have expected or preferred in fact some 13 years would pass before Joseph would

01:09:19.920 --> 01:09:29.680
experience relief the changes in his life are unexpected unclear and unsettling but he didn't ask

01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:37.680
Jehovah what are you doing to me rather he humbly asked what are you doing with me

01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:47.600
so unlike proud Reha Bohm and Jeroboam Joseph could see the cause what Jehovah was setting in motion

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:54.000
not the human flaws he could discern the special work to which he had been appointed

01:09:54.560 --> 01:10:01.279
why he even reassured his brothers that Jehovah had directed and caused his relocation to Egypt

01:10:01.279 --> 01:10:06.560
and it served for the preservation of his family and for all the families of the earth he got that

01:10:08.319 --> 01:10:16.720
and what's the lesson you really need to think about our personal response personal response

01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:26.399
to what Jehovah causes reveals a lot about our humility and our patience our attitude our

01:10:26.399 --> 01:10:36.239
response can lead to a spiritual fall or success now let's get specific with you how can you

01:10:36.239 --> 01:10:44.880
apply this there may be a time when organizational adjustments make it seem that Jehovah has

01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:54.000
handcuffed your talents clipped your wings and maybe this adjustment that you're undergoing it just

01:10:54.000 --> 01:11:01.119
doesn't match your thinking what are you going to do then now what happens don't let pride get in the

01:11:01.119 --> 01:11:08.479
way if you let pride get in the way you could actually delay the fruitage of organizational decisions

01:11:08.479 --> 01:11:13.840
and that's not what you've been trained to do at Gilead it's just the opposite we've talked for

01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:21.119
months about how you need to get on board with the with the organization direction but now imagine

01:11:21.119 --> 01:11:26.720
if you begin to doubt that instruction from headquarters don't really apply to to our country

01:11:27.359 --> 01:11:33.199
oh these instructions they won't work here oh they we're different we do things different the

01:11:33.199 --> 01:11:38.239
brothers in New York they really not they don't understand our circumstances we should apply it

01:11:38.239 --> 01:11:46.239
in a different way you see what have you just done if that type of thinking begins to take root

01:11:46.239 --> 01:11:55.039
you will only hesitate to implement or have heartedly support the direction received and that's

01:11:55.039 --> 01:12:03.680
not what you've been trained to do so you understand how this might apply in the future and voicing such

01:12:03.680 --> 01:12:11.439
doubts can only create an unhealthy spirit and weaken your brothers instead try to see what

01:12:11.439 --> 01:12:18.960
Jehovah is really causing to happen what is he causing to happen Jehovah God is training you to

01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:25.520
better refine such qualities as obedience and patience and loyalty so that you can be used that

01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:35.300
much more for Jehovah's purpose honoring glory for your spiritual health you want to view decisions

01:12:35.300 --> 01:12:42.260
as from Jehovah causing his will to take place even if it is not convenient or you don't immediately

01:12:42.260 --> 01:12:51.939
discern the real benefits there is no spiritual risk in whole heartedly supporting decisions made by

01:12:51.939 --> 01:13:01.779
Jehovah's spirit directed organization see the cause not the flaws there's plenty of human

01:13:01.779 --> 01:13:08.979
flaws to concentrate on get away from that see what Jehovah's setting in motion once you see it

01:13:08.979 --> 01:13:14.979
help others to see it like Joseph use your words to reassure and strengthen your brothers and

01:13:14.979 --> 01:13:20.180
then you know what you'll become a part of what will you become a part of as brothers Anderson said

01:13:21.140 --> 01:13:29.380
that Gilead legacy so stay with that understanding stay with that attitude stay with that motive

01:13:29.380 --> 01:13:39.220
let's distill our discussion down to three points one be careful not to assume that Jehovah's

01:13:39.220 --> 01:13:46.100
permitting just permitting an organizational adjustment when in reality he is far more likely

01:13:46.100 --> 01:13:56.420
causing it to happen too when Jehovah causes a change it can only be for good and three don't be

01:13:56.420 --> 01:14:04.500
quick to see the human flaws it takes patience and humility to work along with Jehovah God as he

01:14:04.500 --> 01:14:14.979
progressively causes his purpose to go forward your maturity your love for Jehovah God his way of

01:14:14.979 --> 01:14:20.739
doing things has been clearly manifest while you've attended Gilead school and that's why Jehovah

01:14:20.819 --> 01:14:30.020
God loves you that's why we love you so maintain this spirit as you work along with God's unfolding

01:14:30.020 --> 01:14:38.500
purpose for it is this attitude that will lead to your spiritual success it is this attitude that

01:14:38.500 --> 01:14:58.989
will help you to continue to see the cause well we thank you very much brother new mayor for that

01:14:58.989 --> 01:15:03.710
excellent discourse well now you have an opportunity to participate in the program

01:15:03.710 --> 01:15:09.470
