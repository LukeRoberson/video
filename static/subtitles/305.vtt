00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:08.789
Irene, you look so handsome.

00:00:08.789 --> 00:00:10.789
No, no, no, no.

00:00:10.789 --> 00:00:13.789
Those came out so nice.

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:15.789
I think it's you.

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:23.820
Let me see if you're still somewhere else.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.820
Sorry, Olivia.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:26.820
Are you okay?

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:27.820
Yeah, it's okay, Sue.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:29.820
I'm so sorry, boys.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.820
Um, I'm almost dead.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:32.820
That was the last box.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.060
Dad, are there some wedding photos?

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:38.060
Let me see.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.060
Look at this.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:01:06.180
Olivia?

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.719
I know.

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:10.719
This is all new, baby.

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:21.870
Be patient.

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:22.870
Can I cut in?

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:23.870
Yeah, sure.

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.700
Thanks.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:50.040
What's wrong?

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.040
Where's the desk?

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.040
We had to get rid of it.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.040
This one's better for everyone.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.040
You mean it's better for him?

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.040
For Max?

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.040
What are you saying?

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.040
What do you care?

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.040
Don't talk to me like that.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.040
Get back here.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:36.150
Hey, Olivia.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.150
What do you think about the desk?

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.150
Come here, sweetie.

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:51.139
Come here.

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:54.139
So you never forget that I love you.

00:02:54.139 --> 00:03:10.740
I hope you like it.

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.740
It's okay, Mom.

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:13.740
You didn't know.

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:16.740
Dad did that for her just before he died.

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:28.300
Anything I can do to help.

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.300
Romans 1210.

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.300
And showing honor to one another.

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.300
Take the lead.

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:49.949
Olivia, I made your favorite tonight.

00:03:49.949 --> 00:04:03.469
Thank you.

00:04:03.469 --> 00:04:07.469
I wanted to tell you I didn't handle that so well today.

00:04:07.469 --> 00:04:14.960
You had good reason to be upset about the desk.

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:19.879
Mom, you didn't know.

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:22.879
It's just one of those things that Dad did just for me.

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:32.660
I know he's my subdad now, but I just wish he would have checked first.

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:34.660
It wasn't Max.

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:36.660
It was me.

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.660
I wanted a surprise Max with a place for him to do his work.

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:47.939
So he didn't make you get rid of the desk?

00:04:47.939 --> 00:04:48.939
No.

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:56.939
I just thought you both didn't care.

00:04:56.939 --> 00:05:23.930
I will never, ever stop caring about you.

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:24.930
Hey, Steve.

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:30.069
Yeah, I'm sorry I was late to the meeting.

00:05:30.069 --> 00:05:35.699
I should have been there to help out with my assignment.

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:41.769
Yeah, we got delayed.

00:05:41.769 --> 00:05:42.769
We're late.

00:05:42.769 --> 00:05:50.850
Let's go, kids.

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:52.850
Yeah, family's fine.

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:55.850
Everybody's adjusting really well.

00:05:55.850 --> 00:06:02.199
Anyone see my glasses?

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:05.889
Anyone?

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:15.939
I mean, we might be a little out of sync, but I don't know.

00:06:15.939 --> 00:06:23.519
Every family has their issues, right?

00:06:23.519 --> 00:06:27.410
You got on sign off?

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:31.939
Hey, well, thanks for understanding.

00:06:31.939 --> 00:06:33.939
All right.

00:06:33.939 --> 00:06:35.939
Okay, take care.

00:06:35.939 --> 00:06:36.939
All right, bye-bye.

00:06:36.939 --> 00:07:11.740
I don't know.

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:13.740
What do you think?

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:14.740
We all have to work on it.

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:16.740
I know I need to.

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:19.740
Why don't we approach it that way with the kids?

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:21.740
Just be open with them.

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:23.740
That sounds like a good idea.

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:31.149
Okay, so Irene and I have been talking about communication

00:07:31.149 --> 00:07:34.149
in our family.

00:07:34.149 --> 00:07:38.149
We want to talk about our phones and other devices.

00:07:38.149 --> 00:07:40.149
You're not talking about me, are you?

00:07:40.149 --> 00:07:41.149
I don't know that.

00:07:41.149 --> 00:07:45.149
I know that we can all be more balanced, but you can't take them away.

00:07:45.149 --> 00:07:47.149
I haven't done anything bad.

00:07:47.149 --> 00:07:48.149
I have responsibilities.

00:07:48.149 --> 00:07:49.149
Hold on.

00:07:49.149 --> 00:07:50.149
You're always on your phone, too.

00:07:50.149 --> 00:07:51.149
That's true.

00:07:51.149 --> 00:07:52.149
It's okay.

00:07:52.149 --> 00:07:54.149
Let's just talk about it.

00:07:54.149 --> 00:07:56.720
All right.

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:58.720
Sue.

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:05.699
Can you read Ephesians 5, 15, and 16 for us, please?

00:08:05.699 --> 00:08:09.699
So keep strict watch that how you walk is not as unwise,

00:08:09.699 --> 00:08:12.699
but as wise persons,

00:08:12.699 --> 00:08:14.699
keeping the best use of your time,

00:08:14.699 --> 00:08:16.699
because the days are wicked.

00:08:16.699 --> 00:08:31.560
So, how do you think we're doing with our phones and other devices?

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:34.559
It isn't that what you're doing on your devices is wrong.

00:08:34.559 --> 00:08:40.559
Exactly, but could it be taking time away from more important things,

00:08:40.559 --> 00:08:42.559
like talking to each other,

00:08:42.559 --> 00:08:54.659
and in that way affecting even how we're talking to each other?

00:08:54.659 --> 00:08:55.659
Yeah.

00:08:55.659 --> 00:08:59.909
I think it'd be smart to have some boundaries then.

00:08:59.909 --> 00:09:06.320
Yeah, okay.

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:10.169
Okay.

00:09:10.169 --> 00:09:12.580
Okay.

00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:20.470
Let's talk about how we can do that.

00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:21.470
I love you.

00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:22.470
Hey.

00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:28.740
Evidently, I haven't figured out how to talk to her about her clothes yet.

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:30.740
I need your help.

00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:37.000
I got this one.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:42.000
I know, but it's all about good spiritual judgment.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000
Do you think that these trends reflect Jehovah's view of respectable dress?

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:59.850
I know that you'll do the right thing.

00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:03.419
While we're all here,

00:10:03.419 --> 00:10:06.419
I know we all have different views on punctuality,

00:10:06.419 --> 00:10:09.419
but I really need your help,

00:10:09.419 --> 00:10:13.419
so I can take care of some of my responsibilities.

00:10:13.419 --> 00:10:17.139
You think we can meet in the middle?

00:10:17.139 --> 00:10:18.139
Yeah.

00:10:18.139 --> 00:10:19.139
All right.

00:10:19.139 --> 00:10:20.139
Great.

00:10:20.139 --> 00:10:46.580
The last few weeks of family worship have been nice.

00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:48.580
Right?

00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:50.580
Yeah.

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:53.580
All these things we ask in praying, Jesus' name.

00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:54.580
Amen.

00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:59.100
Amen.

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:00.100
Okay, this week.

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:03.100
We are in chapter five.

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:04.100
Yeah.

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:05.100
That's right.

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:07.100
And last week gave bread, so this week...

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:09.100
It's suster.

00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:10.100
That's right.

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:12.700
It's suster.

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:14.700
Okay, the point here is that when it comes...

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:15.700
Honey.

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:19.700
Maybe an illustration would be better.

00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:22.700
Okay.

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:24.700
It's like a bird.

00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:27.700
Well, hopefully I was able to clear that up for you a little bit of Olivia.

00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:28.700
Yeah, thank you.

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:31.700
Well, actually, Max, that's not true.

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:37.490
We had an updated understanding in the recent watch tower.

00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:43.000
Thanks.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
I think they went really well.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.250
Right?

00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:50.250
Um...

00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:54.840
Actually...

00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:58.529
Hey.

00:11:58.529 --> 00:12:29.620
Maybe we can talk about it later.

00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:30.620
Want some tea?

00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:31.620
Sure.

00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:40.750
Hey, babe.

00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:41.750
You and me.

00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:42.750
We're a team, right?

00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:44.750
Yeah, of course.

00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:49.190
When I read this, I thought about us.

00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:57.649
So that they are no longer two, but one flesh.

00:12:57.649 --> 00:13:04.600
I know before you had to shoulder everything yourself for so long.

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:06.600
And you did great.

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:11.600
You've been raising two beautiful spiritual kids on your own.

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:14.169
But now you have me.

00:13:14.169 --> 00:13:16.169
Yeah, I do.

00:13:16.169 --> 00:13:20.700
So, do you think sometimes we're not a team?

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:23.700
Well, it's just sometimes during a family worship.

00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:25.700
I get excited and I jump in.

00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:26.700
I know.

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:30.700
I'm just so used to doing it after all these years.

00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:33.700
I know you're not trying to take over and listen.

00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:34.700
I love the way you teach.

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:39.700
I see how you can reach the kids in ways that I can't.

00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:41.700
Just let me guide it.

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:44.700
And I'll make sure you can do that.

00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:45.700
Thanks, honey.

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:47.700
Thanks for your patience.

00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:49.700
No, thank you for your patience.

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:56.370
I'm a work in progress, but we make a great team.

00:13:56.370 --> 00:14:00.370
Why don't we look at what we're going to cover before our next family worship?

00:14:00.370 --> 00:14:01.370
That sounds great.

00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:10.779
Hi.

00:14:10.779 --> 00:14:12.779
Hi, babe.

00:14:12.779 --> 00:14:23.529
So, what's for family worship this week?

00:14:23.529 --> 00:14:25.529
I think I got some good ideas.

00:14:25.529 --> 00:14:26.529
Yeah.

00:14:26.529 --> 00:14:27.529
Mm-hmm.

00:14:27.529 --> 00:14:30.529
Thank you for reading that.

00:14:30.529 --> 00:14:35.179
She's got to ask the question.

00:14:35.179 --> 00:14:36.179
We'll just do that.

00:14:36.179 --> 00:14:42.330
So, a paragraph 13 of 14, how can we be generous?

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:44.610
Anybody?

00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:52.610
Now, the footnote that we just read really helps us to appreciate the definition of that quality.

00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:57.610
Without the definition, we're left to wonder exactly what it is and how it connects

00:14:57.610 --> 00:15:03.039
to the other things that we've discussed this evening.

00:15:03.039 --> 00:15:06.039
Again, can you go ahead and read the next one for us?

00:15:06.039 --> 00:15:14.940
The Bible contains many examples of submissive individuals.

00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:22.139
So, are there examples?

00:15:22.139 --> 00:15:23.139
Sue?

00:15:23.139 --> 00:15:24.139
Yeah.

00:15:24.139 --> 00:15:25.139
That's right.

00:15:25.139 --> 00:15:28.139
When we talk about examples, where do we start?

00:15:28.139 --> 00:15:30.139
There's examples in the past.

00:15:30.139 --> 00:15:33.139
There's even examples presently.

00:15:33.139 --> 00:15:37.139
And we could even be examples.

00:15:37.139 --> 00:15:39.139
That's the power of them.

00:15:39.139 --> 00:15:45.000
Let's keep going.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:55.509
That was a lot of reading.

00:15:55.509 --> 00:15:57.509
I know, right?

00:15:57.509 --> 00:15:59.509
I want to enjoy family worship.

00:15:59.509 --> 00:16:06.509
But I feel like the things that we are covering are just really not what I need right now.

00:16:06.509 --> 00:16:09.759
Yeah.

00:16:09.759 --> 00:16:12.759
You know, I just don't know if this is what they need right now.

00:16:12.759 --> 00:16:16.809
We'll keep working on it.

00:16:16.809 --> 00:16:32.379
March 15, 2014, Watch Tower.

00:16:32.379 --> 00:16:37.860
Family worship, can you make it more enjoyable?

00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:42.860
The worship of Jehovah should not be boring.

00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:50.340
Address the needs of each family member.

00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:52.340
Babe, what do our kids need?

00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:56.779
What's actually going on in their lives?

00:16:56.779 --> 00:17:01.379
Family worship needs to include that.

00:17:01.379 --> 00:17:05.380
Maybe we need to pay more attention to what's going on with them.

00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:06.380
Talk to them.

00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:11.200
Listen to them.

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:13.200
When will you send your link to a great Watch Tower article?

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:15.200
I can't wait to read it.

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:20.819
Max and I changed our approach.

00:17:20.819 --> 00:17:27.750
We found out what mattered to our kids.

00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:33.559
Like friends.

00:17:33.559 --> 00:17:35.559
Adjusting to a blended family.

00:17:35.559 --> 00:17:46.650
Dating.

00:17:46.650 --> 00:17:51.650
So we turned things around and used family worship to focus on what our kids really needed.

00:17:51.650 --> 00:18:09.470
And to prepare ourselves for possible future trials.

00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:25.869
Good night, tell.

00:18:25.869 --> 00:18:26.869
Good night.

00:18:26.869 --> 00:18:28.869
Good night.

00:18:30.869 --> 00:18:33.869
Family worship was cool.

00:18:33.869 --> 00:18:35.869
It was.

00:18:35.869 --> 00:18:37.869
I'm glad you liked it.

00:18:37.869 --> 00:18:38.869
Thank you.

00:18:38.869 --> 00:18:40.869
Good night, Cha.

00:18:40.869 --> 00:18:42.869
Good night.

00:18:42.869 --> 00:18:44.869
Hey, guess what?

00:18:44.869 --> 00:18:45.869
What?

00:18:45.869 --> 00:18:46.869
What?

00:18:46.869 --> 00:18:49.869
I applied to Bethel.

00:18:49.869 --> 00:18:50.869
You did?

00:18:50.869 --> 00:18:51.869
Yep.

00:18:51.869 --> 00:18:54.869
That's really exciting.

00:18:54.869 --> 00:18:56.869
I'm proud of you.

00:18:56.869 --> 00:19:00.819
Thanks.

00:19:00.819 --> 00:19:01.819
Congratulations.

00:19:01.819 --> 00:19:02.819
Thank you.

00:19:02.819 --> 00:19:08.440
Hey, selfie time, everybody.

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:09.440
All right, on three.

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:11.440
We're going to say Bethel, okay?

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:12.440
All right.

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:15.440
One, two, three.

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:17.440
Bethel.

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:38.700
We've come a long way.

00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:55.769
And through it all, Jehovah has taught us to love.

00:19:55.769 --> 00:19:59.769
And he's given our family peace.
