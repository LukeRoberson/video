00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:18.579
At times I felt scared inside

00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:21.940
Only looking for a place to hide

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:25.460
The world made me feel different

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.100

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.219

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.140
That he'd come to my defense his love

00:00:37.679 --> 00:00:43.280
I can't because he gave me courage

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.000
When I was feeling weak

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.520
Courage when I could not speak

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.640
Courage in my dark is not

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:59.810
Courage is stand up tall

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:03.170
Courage is the face it all

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.290
Courage is the trust him with my lies

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.579
Your hope is always by my side

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:29.760
His ways of he'll take and understand

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:41.010
His worth a sacrifice

00:01:41.010 --> 00:02:06.530
Even fire will be

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:27.389
Because he'll give you courage

00:02:28.349 --> 00:03:15.460
Courage is the trust him with

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:19.460
He gave me courage when I was feeling weak

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:23.460
Courage when I could not speak

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:30.849
Courage in my dark is not

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:32.849
Courage is stand up tall

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:36.849
