00:00:04.269 --> 00:00:09.849
Hey, Sophia.

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:10.849
That's okay.

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:25.879
So, what happened after the meth test?

00:00:25.879 --> 00:00:30.190
I tried to get rid of the answer, but...

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:33.189
Hey, why didn't you take the answer?

00:00:33.189 --> 00:00:34.189
Yeah!

00:00:34.189 --> 00:00:37.189
You gave me the best in the class.

00:00:37.189 --> 00:00:40.189
Some things are just more important.

00:00:40.189 --> 00:00:41.189
Like what?

00:00:41.189 --> 00:00:50.179
Like being honest.

00:00:50.179 --> 00:00:53.740
Come on.

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:58.740
Sophia, if you did take the answers, who would know?

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.740
Jehovah.

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.739
But why obey God if we can't even see Him?

00:01:05.739 --> 00:01:17.650
Well...

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.019
Can I show Zoe that Jehovah sees us?

00:01:21.019 --> 00:01:22.019
Hmm.

00:01:22.019 --> 00:01:24.019
We don't see Jehovah.

00:01:24.019 --> 00:01:27.019
But how do you know He's there?

00:01:27.019 --> 00:01:29.019
From the Bible.

00:01:29.019 --> 00:01:32.019
But Zoe just started learning.

00:01:32.019 --> 00:01:33.019
True.

00:01:33.019 --> 00:01:37.019
Can you think of something from Jehovah she's already seen?

00:01:37.019 --> 00:01:42.790
Creation.

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:49.290
It's the last paragraph here.

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.290
God is the one who made all these things.

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.290
God made the heavens and the earth.

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.290
He made people too.

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:01.049
What are your favorite things that God made?

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.459
Well...

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:06.459
I love sunsets.

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:08.460
Fruit.

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.460
Playing with my dog.

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.460
And my mom.

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:13.460
Ah.

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.460
Jehovah made those things because he loves you.

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.830
Even though I can't see him,

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.830
my favorite things remind me that Jehovah sees me.

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.830
And that you always want to listen to him.
