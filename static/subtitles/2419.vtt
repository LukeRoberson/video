00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:23.300
In the whole of humankind, be sure you'll never find someone who can't say, I never

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:33.420
stumbled in my life, and now this time it's you, but there's something you can do.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:43.820
And from the experience and take the help of our loving God provides, get back up when

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:55.060
you're down, you can turn this around, get back up, stand up tall, you can learn, just

00:00:55.060 --> 00:01:03.179
reach out, take his hand, he'll raise you up, make you stand, and one thing that's for

00:01:03.179 --> 00:01:24.379
sure, you'll be stronger than before, if you learn from a fall.

00:01:24.379 --> 00:01:34.709
Another dawn is breaking, and your heart, but you can't go back in time, you have to

00:01:34.709 --> 00:01:45.150
see it through, stop and think it over, and take it to your home, his word is there to

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:56.319
guide you, to pick you up, and show you what to do, back up when you're down, you can

00:01:56.319 --> 00:02:07.620
turn this around, get back up, stand up tall, you can learn, just reach out, take his

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:26.909
hand, he'll raise you up, make you stand, he's stronger than his word, his love is

00:02:27.030 --> 00:03:20.419
greater than our hearts, you make him turn this around, get back up, take his hand,

00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:28.620
it's for sure, you'll be stronger.
