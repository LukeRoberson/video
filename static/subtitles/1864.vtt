00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:05.589
It's been three days since the bomb started to fall

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.750
When the fighting got closer we hit

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.129
But I'm not sure how much longer we can stay here

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:22.710
Some in the congregation plan to leave the country

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.210
Mother says we'll try to when the shilling comes down, but it feels like it may never stop

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:33.070
Jehovah can you still see us?

00:00:33.789 --> 00:00:37.390
Luda you can finish this we have a little more

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.240
Always writing like your father

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:54.600
Thank you grandma. No, you're worried about our brothers and sisters

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.960
Don't remember the days text

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:02.719
No weapon formed against you will have any success

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:05.439
That's right

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:08.359
When we were under ban

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.439
Satan did everything to break our faith

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:14.079
For decades

00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:17.239
But he couldn't stop us preaching. You know why?

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.049
No

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:24.670
Nothing can take Jehovah's law away from his people

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:29.030
They tried but we just threw closer to him

00:01:29.629 --> 00:01:32.939
Jehovah cared for us then

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.700
And he still does

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:38.579
Even if we lose our lives

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.780
That weapon will have no success because of the resurrection

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.900
Luda

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.540
It's time we have to go now

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:08.050
It took forever to get to the station

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:14.599
One by one trains left the city

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:18.699
There were so many people

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.300
so much fear

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.539
Many of the brothers were arrested because they would not fight

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.180
But a few were with us

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.699
The soldier will need to see your IDs. Let's make a line

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.009
Hours felt like days

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.490
I didn't know if we would get on

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:56.699
There's no more room from you back to the shelter now

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:06.509
We can try again tomorrow

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:21.729
This way, please

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:25.569
Jehovah will care for us. This is just a delay not a defeat

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:33.259
Come, please. I'll have to go check on the others

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.580
But I'll text you the moment we know more

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:54.610
What are you thinking about?

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:57.569
I wish Papa were here with us

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:01.169
I know you do

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.810
Your father knew you so well

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:06.449
I miss them too

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:14.110
When it hurts, I think of Jehovah's special promise

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:16.829
To care for us

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.660
Do you remember?

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:21.860
Yes

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.180
Psalms 68.5

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:29.139
A father of the fatherless

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.620
I want to trust him

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:36.819
You can

00:04:36.819 --> 00:04:42.300
The trains have stopped

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.300
Shelling destroy some of the tracks

00:04:44.939 --> 00:04:46.939
What?

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:53.069
Are we trapped?

00:04:53.069 --> 00:04:55.069
Don't worry dear

00:04:55.069 --> 00:04:57.069
But we just know we are here

00:04:57.069 --> 00:04:59.069
Jehovah won't forget us

00:05:00.269 --> 00:05:01.470
Let's pray

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:17.360
We're here. We're over here

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.360
Okay

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.360
I'm sorry it took so long

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.360
Did you hear about the trains?

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.360
Don't worry, there is good news

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.980
We couldn't leave

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:31.980
But brothers and sisters in a safe part of the city

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:33.980
Open their homes to us

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:39.980
I learned that a war can't stop Jehovah

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:43.980
He'll always find a way to care for his people

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:47.980
Nothing can take Jehovah's love away

00:05:51.569 --> 00:05:53.569
I don't know where he will guide us

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:56.370
But I trust him
