00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:12.199
In this talk, we want you to understand the sustaining power of loyal love, because it

00:00:12.199 --> 00:00:21.219
is this quality loyal love and its power that will help you face future trials and challenges

00:00:21.219 --> 00:00:23.859
with confidence in Jehovah.

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:30.980
Well, you perhaps remember the definition of loyal love from a written review, but it's

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:38.979
this, it is love motivated by a strong commitment and a deep attachment.

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:45.380
And here's how King David described loyal love that existed between him and Jehovah.

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.219
He said at Psalm 63-8,

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:50.820
I cling to you.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.659
Your right hand keeps holds fast on me.

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:57.299
Now this is loyal love.

00:00:57.299 --> 00:01:02.420
I cling to you, you hold on to me.

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:08.180
Now in the first century, a woman, a woman who's set an outstanding example of clinging

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.980
to Jehovah is Anna.

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:13.219
How so?

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:14.620
Let's find out.

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:21.739
We open our Bibles to Luke 2, we're going to read verse 36 and 37 and see what lesson

00:01:21.739 --> 00:01:28.099
we can learn and apply to you.

00:01:28.099 --> 00:01:33.260
Now there was a prophetess Anna, the daughter of Fanuel, of Asher's tribe.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:38.180
This woman was well along in years and had lived with her husband for seven years after

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:39.819
they were married.

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:43.540
And she was a widow now 84 years old.

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:49.780
She was never missing from the temple, rendering sacred service day and night with fasting

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.260
and supplications.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.379
Well, here we have it.

00:01:54.379 --> 00:01:57.819
Everything we know about Anna is right here.

00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:00.099
Luke recorded it.

00:02:00.099 --> 00:02:06.099
She was 84 years old when Luke introduces her to us.

00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:11.580
Likely she hadn't lived long enough to become a follower of Jesus to be anointed with Holy

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.740
Spirit or to enjoy preaching the good news of the kingdom.

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.300
That's it.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:24.139
If we stop right there, but what if we don't?

00:02:24.139 --> 00:02:26.580
What if we dig deeper?

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:27.699
What will we learn?

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:28.699
That will help you.

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:32.020
Well, let's do that.

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:37.469
Anna was born about 86 BCE.

00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:44.990
When she was 23 years old, Jerusalem was filled with violence and divisions.

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:47.509
Jewish leaders such as the Maccabees were at war.

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:52.870
Roman forces under the leadership of a soldier named Pompey came to restore order and in

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:59.150
the process, some 12,000 Jews reportedly died.

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:05.750
It is possible that Anna's husband was one of these victims.

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:11.990
Then when Anna was 47 years old, the Romans appointed Herod as King of Judea.

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:13.150
Herod?

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.389
This man was not a descendant of David.

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:17.550
He was not even in Israelite.

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.550
He was an itemite.

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:23.990
The itemites were sworn enemies of true worship.

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:30.990
Now on top of that, the hypocritical Jewish religious leaders made life hard for people,

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:33.789
including widows like Anna.

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:37.909
So now Anna watches as Jehovah's House of Prayer.

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:42.710
The place she cherished became a cave of robbers.

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:46.710
Pure worship is withering on the vine.

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:48.710
What will Anna do?

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:50.750
She could have been stumbled.

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:52.430
She could have reasoned.

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.590
I supported true worship on my life.

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:00.030
I believe the Messiah would come and the prophecies would come.

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.909
I go to the temple every day.

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:03.830
I've done everything right.

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:05.669
But things have only gotten worse.

00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:07.430
God lets my husband die.

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.389
An itemite is rebuilding the temple.

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:12.030
What's happening?

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.550
Has Jehovah left us?

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:17.829
Should I leave to?

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:19.110
Anna could have given up.

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:20.110
Walked away.

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:21.110
It became bitter.

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:23.110
But she didn't.

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:24.110
Why?

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:25.589
Why?

00:04:25.589 --> 00:04:28.990
It was the roots of her loyal love.

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:34.430
That sustaining power of loyal love went deep and it wrapped around Jehovah.

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:39.990
And she had the power to keep clinging to him under those circumstances.

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:44.670
Anna was determined to serve Jehovah to the best of her ability.

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:47.110
What did she do again?

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.029
She had verse 37.

00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:53.389
She was never missing from the temple.

00:04:53.389 --> 00:05:03.519
She was in the right place, rendering sacred service day and night doing the right thing,

00:05:03.519 --> 00:05:08.800
with fasting and supplications with the right attitude.

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:15.600
She was doing the right thing in the right place with the right attitude.

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:21.160
Something could stop this seemingly fragile servant of God from clinging to her closest

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.839
friend, Jehovah.

00:05:23.839 --> 00:05:35.120
In effect, Anna was saying, I cling to you, Jehovah, and her loyal love was noticed.

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:42.360
Chapter 2 and verse 38, it reveals that Anna was present when the baby Jesus was brought

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.560
to the temple.

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:48.399
And when she saw that baby, what did she begin to do in verse 38?

00:05:48.399 --> 00:05:55.120
It says, she came near, she began giving thanks to God, speaking about the child to all

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:59.279
who are waiting for Jerusalem's deliverance.

00:05:59.279 --> 00:06:01.959
Can you sense her joy?

00:06:01.959 --> 00:06:06.480
Can you feel the joy she had at seeing and perhaps even holding that little baby the future

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:08.160
Messiah?

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:14.319
This was something that this elderly woman had never expected in her lifetime.

00:06:14.319 --> 00:06:22.360
The child in front of her was proof, tangible proof, concrete evidence that Jehovah had

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:29.399
not abandoned his people, and he did not abandon Anna.

00:06:29.399 --> 00:06:42.839
So not only had Anna clung to Jehovah, Jehovah held onto her and rewarded her.

00:06:42.839 --> 00:06:47.240
This is loyal love.

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:56.199
Anna's faithful record is so well known that some fifty years later, fifty years later

00:06:56.199 --> 00:07:00.279
or so Luke was compelled to write about her.

00:07:00.279 --> 00:07:02.000
Where did Luke get his information?

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.680
Who did he talk to?

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:07.240
Did he talk to Mary interview her or some of the older ones?

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:08.800
There was this woman, Anna.

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:09.959
She was at the temple.

00:07:09.959 --> 00:07:11.600
She would never leave.

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:13.759
We don't know.

00:07:13.759 --> 00:07:21.560
But what we do know is that Jehovah inspired Luke to record and to document her life in

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:26.439
his word so that we could be taught lessons.

00:07:26.439 --> 00:07:33.040
And here we are, some two thousand years later, and we are using her life as an example

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:40.250
of commitment and unbreakable integrity for you students to imitate.

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:46.209
So what can you learn from Anna's example?

00:07:46.209 --> 00:07:49.810
You may suffer loss of one kind or another.

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:53.970
You will come face to face with the imperfections of others.

00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:59.290
Your feelings may get hurt, and you might find yourself coping with an unexpected change

00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:02.689
in your life that is not pleasant.

00:08:02.689 --> 00:08:08.569
Or you may feel that you are a victim of an injustice or a serious misunderstanding from

00:08:08.569 --> 00:08:11.610
within the organization.

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:13.730
What will you do?

00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:16.189
This is what you will do.

00:08:16.189 --> 00:08:21.550
You will cling to Jehovah, and you will experience him holding on to you.

00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:22.870
You cling to him.

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:25.949
He holds on to you.

00:08:25.949 --> 00:08:32.830
For example, I recall a time when a brother serving in a foreign field due to a misunderstanding

00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:38.590
lost of his privileges as an elder, and he felt the decision was unfair.

00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:45.309
He was deeply hurt, but his wife, he and his wife never stopped clinging to Jehovah and

00:08:45.309 --> 00:08:48.789
their spiritual routine.

00:08:48.789 --> 00:08:53.590
Then at a regional convention, a brother approached him and thanked him for the talk that he

00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:55.149
gave on the program.

00:08:55.149 --> 00:09:01.789
Well, he volunteered in the cleaning department, but he hadn't given a talk.

00:09:01.789 --> 00:09:08.710
Then the brother, as said to this former elder, when I see your smile and positive attitude,

00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:17.309
yes, you gave a talk, and it was on loyalty, and it was loud and clear.

00:09:17.309 --> 00:09:23.870
So the former elder now relates, the experience taught me and my wife that every challenge

00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:31.389
or misfortune does not need to represent a threat to our spiritual well-being.

00:09:31.389 --> 00:09:36.870
We've come to view rejection failure or being misunderstood as normal episodes in the

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:40.990
lives of competent, healthy people.

00:09:40.990 --> 00:09:44.750
Instead of being crushed, we grew.

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:52.230
You see, the couple looked beyond their hardships, and they clung to Jehovah.

00:09:52.230 --> 00:10:04.450
How by imitating Anna, they were never missing from true worship in the right place, rendering

00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:11.889
sacred service day and night, doing the right thing, with fasting and supplications, and

00:10:11.889 --> 00:10:20.570
sometimes those supplications involved tears, but with the right attitude and Jehovah held

00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:24.570
on to them and never let go.

00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:27.769
The brother is still serving in the foreign field.

00:10:27.769 --> 00:10:34.940
He's an elder again and giving memorable talks.

00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:40.710
So what do we want you to remember from this talk?

00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:43.789
We want you to remember this.

00:10:43.789 --> 00:10:50.269
When you come face to face with future trials and you will, or challenges in your life,

00:10:50.269 --> 00:11:02.440
and you will, this is what happens in life, be in the right place, do the right thing,

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:04.720
with the right attitude.

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:13.360
By doing this, you declare Jehovah, I cling to you, and I trust you hold on to me.
