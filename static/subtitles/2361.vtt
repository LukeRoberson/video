00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:14.869
You're at the Kingdom Hall about to give a public talk.

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:18.870
Will the audience listen to what you have to say?

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:23.030
Much depends on how you introduce your subject.

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:29.989
An effective introduction arouses interest, identifies your subject, and shows why the

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:33.390
subject is important to your listeners.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.259
Let's give our brother an opportunity to introduce his subject.

00:00:39.259 --> 00:00:45.259
As the meeting chairman mentioned, we're going to talk about death and what it means to

00:00:45.259 --> 00:00:47.420
you and me.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.740
Let's read a scripture at Ecclesiastes95.

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.380
So what do you think?

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.340
Did the speaker identify his subject?

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.340
Yes.

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.579
Did he arouse interest?

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.420
Not so much.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.579
Did he show why the subject is important?

00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:09.500
No.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.340
So how might he approach the subject differently?

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.739
Let's watch.

00:01:15.739 --> 00:01:21.980
Throughout all of human history, not one person has escaped death.

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:28.540
The lives of some people are cut short suddenly by unexpected events or illness.

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.420
Have you ever lost a loved one in death?

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.939
If so, you know how painful that is.

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:42.540
But how can something that causes so much pain be a normal, natural part of life?

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.900
The Bible is the key to understanding why we die.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:53.379
Where we go when we die and how death will be reversed.

00:01:53.379 --> 00:01:57.219
Let's consider each of those points.

00:01:57.219 --> 00:02:01.540
You can apply this principle to any subject when giving a talk.

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:06.420
But how can you effectively introduce a subject in the ministry?

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.699
Remember of course that in most cases you're a complete stranger to the householder.

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:13.259
Try not to startle the person.

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:16.780
Identify yourself early in the conversation.

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:22.699
To determine what a person might be interested in, observe his activities or surroundings.

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:28.580
You might begin by asking a question or making a brief comment about those things.

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.539
Let's consider one example.

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:36.509
Hi, my name's Jill.

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:39.629
I'm here to talk about God's purpose for the future.

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:46.789
The Bible says here, sorry, but I don't have time to talk.

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:49.990
Was the introduction effective?

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:56.990
The householder didn't want to continue the conversation, so apparently the introduction didn't arouse interest.

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:05.210
How might the publisher have handled the situation better?

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:06.650
Good morning.

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.770
You have a beautiful garden.

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.330
It must take a lot of work.

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:13.729
It sure does.

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:16.330
Well, your work is certainly paying off.

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:17.330
Thank you.

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.650
By the way, my name's Jill, and this is Tammy.

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:21.889
I'm Emily.

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:26.490
Emily, you work so hard to care for the garden you planted.

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:34.629
Do you think that God cares the same way about this planet that he created?

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:39.110
Because the publisher took into account the interests of the householder,

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:45.030
she increased the chances of starting a conversation and sharing the kingdom message.

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.909
This can also be done in urban areas where people expect you to get right to the point.

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:57.710
In such settings, try to include a thought-provoking statement or a question in your introduction.

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:05.909
Effective introductions are the first step toward productive conversations and presentations of the good news.
