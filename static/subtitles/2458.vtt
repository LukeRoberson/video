00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:05.419
We will start our program by visiting the South Africa branch.

00:00:05.419 --> 00:00:10.980
The work there has increased tremendously in the past few years, and the branch is now

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.300
expanding to support the growth.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:20.379
Globally, the good news is published in over 800 languages.

00:00:20.379 --> 00:00:23.940
Almost 300 of those languages are spoken in Africa.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:29.620
The South Africa branch supports printing, purchasing, building design, and audio video production

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:30.940
in the region.

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:36.820
The literature is printed and packed for over 15,000 congregations in 20 countries.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:42.060
To keep up with this demand, printing and shipping teams run two shifts per day.

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.500
And in peak periods, the press works around the clock.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.740
To help speed up work in the boundary and shipping departments, we have automated and mechanized

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:52.619
many work processes.

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:58.140
Arrangements are underway to install a second printing press, but with all this increase

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.939
storage spaces become very limited.

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:03.939
So the shipping department needs a larger warehouse.

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:09.099
The Regional Audio Video Center supports all languages in Africa with producing audio

00:01:09.099 --> 00:01:10.859
and video items.

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:14.900
They are currently busy with an extensive training program.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:20.780
And soon, recording facilities will be set up in over 100 different locations on this

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:21.780
continent.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.700
The results are wonderful.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.340
Five years ago, none of our videos were released in any of the languages of Africa.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:37.019
Now, 300 languages have permission to produce audio and video publications.

00:01:37.019 --> 00:01:42.099
Recently, a branch video team has been established to assist in providing video material for

00:01:42.099 --> 00:01:45.459
JWL.org and for JW Broadcasting.

00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:51.379
Due to this growing demand for audio and video publications, new facilities are needed.

00:01:51.379 --> 00:01:56.500
In order to support these increases, the branch is busy with a large expansion project.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.540
Doing so in an ecologically sensitive residential area and without interrupting publication

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.780
production is challenging.

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:10.099
The first part of the expansion project is a five-story building with 48 new residence

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:11.099
rooms.

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:15.060
Now, this building is scheduled to be completed by May of 2015.

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.340
The major part of the expansion project is the shipping warehouse.

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.060
Now, this is a massive building.

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.939
It's 210 meters long, 70 meters wide and 15 meters high.

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:30.419
And perhaps just to put that into perspective, you could park three Boeing 747s inside of

00:02:30.419 --> 00:02:31.419
this building.

00:02:31.419 --> 00:02:35.620
Ajoining the warehouse is an administration building that will house the regional audio

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.699
video centre.

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:42.419
Included will be state-of-the-art recording studios and editing facilities.

00:02:42.419 --> 00:02:46.860
When designing these buildings, attention was given to making them environmentally friendly,

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:52.099
energy efficient and also pleasant for the brothers and sisters who will be working inside.

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:56.060
The concrete structure of the warehouse has been designed in such a way that in the future

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.659
additional suspended slabs for officers could be added if the use of the building ever

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:02.060
needs to change.

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.219
This is what we call future-proofing a building.

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:10.060
The branch road system is also being upgraded to allow all of the literature to be transported

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:15.219
safely and efficiently between the printries and the new warehouse building.

00:03:15.219 --> 00:03:19.740
The windwater runoff from the roads, roofs and paving all of these new buildings and areas

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:23.620
is going to be directed into a large stormwater attenuation pond.

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.740
And from there the water will slowly be discharged into a local stream.

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:31.500
Solar roof panels are being installed in various places around the branch to harvest some

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:37.139
of the beautiful sunshine that we have and added as electricity into the Bethel power grid.

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:41.819
The last phase of the project will be to upgrade the printry in preparation for a second

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:43.860
man-rolling printing press.

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.419
A new visitors deck will be added and when you come on tour you will be able to have

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:50.939
a bird's eye view of all of the action down at the process.

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:56.060
The building project has been contracted to several construction companies to speed up

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:57.379
the schedule.

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:02.419
At the peak of construction 700 contract workers will be on site.

00:04:02.419 --> 00:04:07.780
We also have a large group of brothers and sisters from 21 different countries to assist

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:14.139
with project management, quality control, mechanical and electrical installation and some

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:17.139
of the finishes and build the straights.

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:22.620
On weekends volunteers from local congregations come into a sense with site preparation

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.699
between the different phases.

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:30.980
The good news reached Africa more than 100 years ago since then it has grown in many receptive

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:31.980
parts.

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:39.060
Currently 3.5 million Bible studies have been conducted in Africa that is 30 percent

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.060
of the global figure.

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:46.540
This certainly shows that Jehovah is drawing people from every nation, tribe and tongue

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:51.790
to bring in praise.

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:53.990
Exciting developments indeed.

00:04:53.990 --> 00:05:00.069
We are happy to see how the Kingdom Preaching work is speeding up all over the world.

00:05:00.069 --> 00:05:05.149
And you may have noticed that we decided to use outside contractors to help with this

00:05:05.149 --> 00:05:07.389
particular project.

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:12.829
Although we generally use our own construction workers, it can sometimes be beneficial to

00:05:12.829 --> 00:05:16.990
use contractors on a case by case basis.

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:21.829
At times that can speed up a project and result in savings.
