WEBVTT

00:00:00.820 --> 00:02:28.289
Hey Dad, what type of who is this?

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:33.539
This is Tamboti, you know?

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:36.539
Jehovah made this strong and durable.

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:39.539
Hey, just like you, Mombi.

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:41.539
Just like you, Dad.

00:02:41.539 --> 00:03:03.340
Come back again.

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:27.479
Let's try this.

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:28.479
Hey, see?

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:31.479
Oh, Mombi.

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:32.479
How are you, sir?

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:33.479
How are you?

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:34.479
How are you?

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:35.479
How are you, sir?

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:37.479
How are you doing?

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:38.479
How was your day?

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:39.479
Good.

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:40.479
Good.

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:41.479
How about service?

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:42.479
Oh, wonderful.

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:44.479
Parvamos, are you still coming for dinner tonight?

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:45.479
Of course.

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:46.479
Guess what?

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:47.479
He's staying for family worship, too.

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:48.479
Yes.

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:49.479
You're no cool with dropping off when we finish.

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:50.479
Oh, okay.

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:51.479
Thanks, you're no cool.

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:53.479
You know the invitation is still open for you.

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:54.479
Thanks so much for money.

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:55.479
Yeah.

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:56.479
Okay.

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:57.479
All right, brothers.

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:58.479
The brothers have a good one.

00:03:58.479 --> 00:03:59.479
Okay, see you soon.

00:03:59.479 --> 00:04:01.479
So, it's the head to the family, too.

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:06.419
Braja.

00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:07.419
Hey, see for it.

00:04:07.419 --> 00:04:12.800
How are you doing?

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:13.800
Good.

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:14.800
How are you two doing?

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.800
Oh, the baby kept me up all night.

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.800
Kicking again, huh?

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:20.800
Yes.

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.800
How's the family doing today?

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.800
Oh, they're doing good.

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:25.800
Oh.

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.800
A money is making dinner.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.800
We have family worship today, too.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:32.800
Oh.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:33.800
Yeah.

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.800
We have such good parents.

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.800
Always teaching.

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.800
Oh.

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.800
It takes a lot of patience and practice.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:44.800
But don't worry.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.800
You're going to be a great mother.

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.800
I can already tell.

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:49.800
Thank you.

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:50.800
And you won't be alone.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.800
We'll be here to help you.

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.800
We want to help you teach your child about Jehovah.

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.800
You're part of our family now.

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:59.800
Thank you.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:00.800
Yeah.

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.800
See for it.

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:04.800
Hey, I'm money.

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:05.800
How are you doing?

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:06.800
I'm doing good.

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:07.800
Yeah, good.

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.800
Are you going to be staying for dinner?

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:10.800
No, no, no.

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.800
I just wanted to say hi.

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.800
Are we still on for a Bible Saturday tomorrow?

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:16.800
Yes, I'm looking forward to it.

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:17.800
Okay.

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:18.800
Okay.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:19.800
All right.

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:20.800
See you.

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:21.800
Bye, see you for it.

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:22.800
Bye.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:23.800
See you tomorrow.

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.899
See you.

00:05:27.899 --> 00:05:28.899
You're doing so great with her.

00:05:28.899 --> 00:05:29.899
Thank you.

00:05:29.899 --> 00:05:33.500
Can't wait to see her get baptized.

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:34.500
I pray so.

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:35.500
Yeah.

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.500
Let me go finish up dinner.

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:38.500
Okay.

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.500
I'll come inside and help you.

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:47.620
You're smelling good.

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:48.620
Thank you.

00:05:52.620 --> 00:06:02.639
Oh, good.

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:05.430
Good.

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:06.430
How are you?

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:07.430
Wow.

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:09.430
Going to every day.

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:10.430
Oh.

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:11.430
Good.

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:12.430
Yeah.

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:14.430
Don't be here.

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:16.430
That's my brother.

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:18.430
Hey, someone brings you back.

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:21.430
Give this to the family, of course.

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:23.430
Plus, I wanted to bring you a gift, too.

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:24.430
Oh.

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:25.430
Yeah.

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:26.430
And we need to talk.

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:27.430
Have something for us to talk about.

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:28.430
Okay, kids.

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:29.430
Let's go.

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:30.430
Let's get some privacy.

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:31.430
Okay.

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:34.430
You don't have to bring a gift every time you come to visit.

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:35.430
I want to.

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:36.430
My brother.

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:38.430
Here.

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:39.430
This is nice.

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:40.430
Thank you.

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:41.430
You're welcome.

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:42.430
This is too much.

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:44.430
Amani, this is nothing.

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:46.430
I actually got an upgrade.

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:48.430
You can use this one.

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:49.430
Okay.

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:52.430
I'm glad you like it.

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:55.430
Amani, there's something we have to talk about.

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:58.100
Let me ask.

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:00.100
How steady has your work been lately?

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:06.230
My carpentry work is being slow.

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:09.230
But we're getting by.

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:12.230
You know, my mom and I, we sell a woodcarb inside the market

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:14.230
for some extra income.

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:16.230
Wow.

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:22.879
Amani, look how you've done on our land.

00:07:25.579 --> 00:07:27.579
You're a good carpenter.

00:07:27.579 --> 00:07:30.579
You built this house.

00:07:30.579 --> 00:07:34.579
And you have a beautiful family, too.

00:07:34.579 --> 00:07:36.579
It's mom and dad who are alive.

00:07:36.579 --> 00:07:39.579
They will be very proud of you.

00:07:42.579 --> 00:07:44.579
We know what I'm thinking, Amani.

00:07:44.579 --> 00:07:49.579
With your skillset, you could have more.

00:07:49.579 --> 00:07:53.579
I'm talking about real security for you and the family.

00:07:53.579 --> 00:07:57.860
A real government carpentry contract.

00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:05.850
See, just look here.

00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:09.850
This is the amount we can't be making.

00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:10.850
Yes.

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:12.850
Yes, for real.

00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:17.850
All you need to do, Amani, is just...

00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:19.850
Yeah.

00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:21.850
Not a party card.

00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:25.259
You know I can't sign this.

00:08:25.259 --> 00:08:26.259
Wait.

00:08:26.259 --> 00:08:29.259
You didn't sign me up, did you?

00:08:29.259 --> 00:08:31.259
I know what you're thinking about, Amani.

00:08:31.259 --> 00:08:35.259
See, you don't have to involve yourself with the political ideas.

00:08:35.259 --> 00:08:38.259
You don't even have to attend any of the rallies.

00:08:38.259 --> 00:08:40.259
You know what, forget it.

00:08:40.259 --> 00:08:42.259
I'll take care of this one.

00:08:42.259 --> 00:08:44.259
Basically, you'll be working for me.

00:08:44.259 --> 00:08:46.259
So, don't worry about the card.

00:08:46.259 --> 00:08:50.259
All I need you to do is just sign here.

00:08:50.259 --> 00:08:55.259
And this becomes a reality for us.

00:08:55.259 --> 00:09:01.779
Amani, you know I love you.

00:09:01.779 --> 00:09:08.080
And if you become successful, I will be very happy.

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:11.620
I have to get back.

00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:14.620
But just think about it.

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:19.120
And think about the family, too.

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:44.250
So, tonight, we're going to continue with our study of the account of Joseph.

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:48.250
Remember last week we discussed how Joseph was wrongly accused?

00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:53.250
And yet, he was able to make peace with his brothers.

00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:56.250
Thank you, Dad. She needs to hear this.

00:09:57.250 --> 00:10:00.980
Papa Musa.

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:05.980
Yes, may I share a voice that has always been a lot to me.

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:07.980
Please do.

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:11.580
This is one of my favorites.

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:17.519
Psalm 37 verse 5.

00:10:17.519 --> 00:10:21.519
Commit your way to Jehovah.

00:10:21.519 --> 00:10:24.519
Relay on him.

00:10:24.519 --> 00:10:30.110
And he will act in your behalf.

00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:35.110
For me, this is exactly what Joseph had to do.

00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:41.110
But do you remember how long Joseph had to endure,

00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:45.110
slavery, and imprisonment in Egypt?

00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:47.110
13 years.

00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:49.110
Yes, Maombi.

00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:55.110
Even longer than you have been alive.

00:10:55.110 --> 00:11:03.059
So, what helped Joseph to be patient all those years?

00:11:03.059 --> 00:11:07.080
Well, think back to the first.

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:11.080
Commit your way to Jehovah.

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:15.080
Joseph didn't know how everything would turn out.

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:18.080
And a lot of things were out of his control.

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:22.080
When Joseph committed his way to Jehovah,

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:25.080
Jehovah always acted in his behalf.

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:28.080
Even in prison.

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:32.460
Jehovah was always with him.

00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:35.460
If we prayerfully rely on Jehovah,

00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:40.460
Jehovah will act in our behalf.

00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:43.460
That's a beautiful point, Musa.

00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:45.460
Thank you.

00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:50.460
So, children, how can we apply that verse today?

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:53.460
Well, we can pray to Jehovah for courage.

00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:56.460
Just like Joseph did in the original song.

00:11:56.460 --> 00:11:59.460
Can we sing it tonight?

00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:01.460
Yes, Zawadi.

00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:03.460
A little later though.

00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:05.460
But you're right, Maombi.

00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:09.460
Prayer is very essential, especially for a family

00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:12.460
if we're going to endure these last days.

00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:14.460
What about Uncle Danil?

00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:16.460
Does he pray to Jehovah?

00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:18.460
No, maybe.

00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:22.460
But we can't look into his heart.

00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:24.460
Yeah.

00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:27.460
Musa taught us both when we were boys.

00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:29.460
So he knows about Jehovah.

00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:36.120
But no one can make him love Jehovah.

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:39.120
Yes, I remember those days.

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:44.120
Your father and uncle Danil, they were trouble.

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:49.620
Both of them were so independent.

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:54.480
I wish I had done more to help Danil.

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:58.269
We haven't given up on him yet.

00:12:58.269 --> 00:13:01.269
Okay, children, let's keep digging.

00:13:01.269 --> 00:13:03.269
Let's continue with the account of Joseph

00:13:03.269 --> 00:13:07.269
to see what else we can learn from the second part.

00:13:07.269 --> 00:13:10.269
Can we take turns as characters?

00:13:10.269 --> 00:13:12.269
How to read Joseph's part?

00:13:12.269 --> 00:13:14.269
Okay, let's do that.

00:13:14.269 --> 00:13:16.269
Genesis chapter 40.

00:13:16.269 --> 00:13:18.269
And Zawadi will be Joseph.

00:13:18.269 --> 00:14:58.860
No.

00:14:58.860 --> 00:14:59.860
Appreciate it.

00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:04.259
No, thank you.

00:15:04.259 --> 00:15:07.080
Come on, Maombi.

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:12.879
Free shirts.

00:15:12.879 --> 00:15:14.879
Dad, can I play some music?

00:15:14.879 --> 00:15:15.879
Sure, grab it.

00:15:15.879 --> 00:15:29.419
Nah.

00:15:29.419 --> 00:15:32.899
There's no need to worry.

00:15:32.899 --> 00:15:33.899
Okay.

00:15:33.899 --> 00:15:36.899
Will they come here?

00:15:36.899 --> 00:15:37.899
No.

00:15:37.899 --> 00:15:39.899
These are just threats.

00:15:39.899 --> 00:15:40.899
Rumors.

00:15:40.899 --> 00:15:42.899
There's nothing to it.

00:15:42.899 --> 00:15:44.899
Listen, change the station.

00:15:44.899 --> 00:15:45.899
Why don't you play some music?

00:15:45.899 --> 00:16:19.740
We humbly come before you.

00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:21.740
In the name of your son, Jesus Christ.

00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:22.740
Amen.

00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:23.740
Amen.

00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:28.740
Thank you, brother, so much for making the time to come tonight.

00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:31.740
So we can talk about an important matter.

00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:35.740
As you are aware, the branch has recommended that we meet

00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:41.019
and discuss the possibility of several unrest in our area.

00:16:41.019 --> 00:16:45.649
You know, just yesterday, the marketplace was buzzing.

00:16:45.649 --> 00:16:48.649
There will always be rumors surrounding the elections.

00:16:48.649 --> 00:16:52.649
But you know, we had some reports on the radio.

00:16:52.649 --> 00:16:55.649
I want us to see what the threat is in our area

00:16:55.649 --> 00:16:57.649
and what we can do for their friends.

00:16:57.649 --> 00:17:00.649
So we can help them if they decide to flee.

00:17:00.649 --> 00:17:05.650
Did they direct us to leave or ask us to think about it?

00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:08.650
Well, they have advised us to have a plan.

00:17:08.650 --> 00:17:12.650
The way people are feeling about the current leadership now

00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:16.650
is just a matter of time that I conflict to come in this area.

00:17:16.650 --> 00:17:20.650
The safety of the congregation is the concern.

00:17:20.650 --> 00:17:22.650
Yes, I agree with that.

00:17:22.650 --> 00:17:25.650
You know, I've heard about the violence of these militias

00:17:25.650 --> 00:17:26.650
towards other tribes.

00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:29.650
But is it worth alarming the congregation?

00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:34.650
Has anyone actually seen anything out of the ordinary here?

00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:36.650
This is serious.

00:17:36.650 --> 00:17:38.650
Whether it's smoke, there's fire.

00:17:38.650 --> 00:17:39.650
I'm sorry.

00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:41.650
That's what I'm trying to say.

00:17:41.650 --> 00:17:45.650
Telling the friends to flee now?

00:17:45.650 --> 00:17:49.650
Brothers, I've been through this before.

00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:51.650
And trust me.

00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:54.650
There isn't even smoke here.

00:17:54.650 --> 00:17:56.650
Doesn't this seem a bit hasty?

00:17:56.650 --> 00:18:03.359
Yes, it seems so.

00:18:03.359 --> 00:18:08.359
Brothers, we may differ in our opinions.

00:18:08.359 --> 00:18:15.380
But remember, we are still one body.

00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:22.250
And think about the times that we live in.

00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:25.250
These are the last of the last days.

00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:31.660
So we expect that these conditions would increase.

00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:38.750
Proverbs 22, verse 3.

00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:44.750
Remember, it tells us the shoe one sees the danger

00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:49.019
and conceals himself.

00:18:49.019 --> 00:18:59.230
So it is true to prepare the congregation mentally and spiritually.

00:18:59.230 --> 00:19:05.519
Thank you so much, Musa.

00:19:05.519 --> 00:19:10.519
You've helped us to have a unified thought in this matter.

00:19:10.519 --> 00:19:16.519
So if it is okay with you, brothers, I have an exit plan.

00:19:16.519 --> 00:19:19.519
I brought the map of our territory

00:19:19.519 --> 00:19:21.519
and where the brothers and sisters live

00:19:21.519 --> 00:19:23.519
and where they can't flee to.

00:19:23.519 --> 00:19:44.849
Let's look at it together.

00:19:44.849 --> 00:20:05.589
Time for bed.

00:20:05.589 --> 00:20:07.589
I'm keeping it going.

00:20:07.589 --> 00:20:08.589
It's getting late.

00:20:08.589 --> 00:20:09.589
Time for bed.

00:20:09.589 --> 00:20:10.589
Okay.

00:20:10.589 --> 00:20:11.589
Okay.

00:20:11.589 --> 00:20:12.589
Good night.

00:20:12.589 --> 00:20:13.589
Good night.

00:20:13.589 --> 00:20:22.779
Manny, wake up.

00:20:22.779 --> 00:20:25.779
We have to go right now.

00:20:25.779 --> 00:20:27.779
I've been through this before.

00:20:27.779 --> 00:20:28.779
And trust me.

00:20:28.779 --> 00:20:30.779
There isn't even smoke here.

00:20:30.779 --> 00:20:35.700
You okay?

00:20:46.490 --> 00:20:51.900
I keep thinking about what my family experienced when I was young.

00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:54.900
We had to run for our safety.

00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:57.900
At least that's what we thought we were doing.

00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:01.900
But when we left, we lost everything.

00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:05.500
For what?

00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:07.500
For nothing.

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:10.500
And just like that, the conflict passed.

00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:14.779
That was it.

00:21:14.779 --> 00:21:18.859
Is that happening now?

00:21:18.859 --> 00:21:20.859
Would we have to flee?

00:21:20.859 --> 00:21:22.859
We received the reaction from the branch.

00:21:22.859 --> 00:21:29.019
Those brothers are so far away though.

00:21:29.019 --> 00:21:34.880
I keep wondering if they have been overly cautious.

00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:39.130
Maybe for the brothers in the city.

00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:41.130
But for us here,

00:21:41.130 --> 00:21:49.660
it's that the right decision.

00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:52.660
Would we have to go to a camp?

00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:54.660
I think about Musa.

00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:57.660
He would not be able to make such a trip.

00:21:57.660 --> 00:22:02.329
I'm thinking about Sifah too.

00:22:02.329 --> 00:22:07.329
You know around the elections, these tensions always seem to pop up.

00:22:07.329 --> 00:22:10.329
But overall,

00:22:10.329 --> 00:22:15.500
things are pretty stable around here, don't you think?

00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:17.500
I mean, dunia.

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:21.880
Dunia offered me a contract.

00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:27.160
This work is guaranteed.

00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:32.160
Amani, this is more money than we've ever had.

00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:35.160
This could be a blessing from Jehovah.

00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:38.160
He wouldn't have this great buy.

00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:42.160
If we were to leave now, this opportunity would go with it.

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:46.910
The door would be shut.

00:22:46.910 --> 00:22:49.910
The whole point of us building this house

00:22:49.910 --> 00:22:53.910
was to give our children a better life.

00:22:53.910 --> 00:23:04.859
I just don't want them to experience what I went through.

00:23:04.859 --> 00:23:06.859
Trust me.

00:23:06.859 --> 00:23:10.859
In a couple of weeks, this time we'll just blow over.

00:23:10.859 --> 00:23:12.859
You think so?

00:23:12.859 --> 00:23:13.859
Yeah.

00:23:13.859 --> 00:23:14.859
Just wait.

00:23:14.859 --> 00:23:15.859
You see.

00:23:15.859 --> 00:23:53.500
Me?

00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:54.500
Yes, sir.

00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:55.500
Nice to meet you.

00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:56.500
Your brother sent me.

00:23:56.500 --> 00:23:57.500
Yeah.

00:23:57.500 --> 00:23:58.500
For the stools, right?

00:23:58.500 --> 00:23:59.500
For the stools.

00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:00.500
Let me get them for you.

00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:01.500
Yes.

00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:02.500
Your brother said you did good work.

00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:03.500
Of course, I do by myself.

00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:04.500
Got my tooth right here.

00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:05.500
Nice.

00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:06.500
Yeah, here you go.

00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:07.500
How much for four of them?

00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:08.500
For the four?

00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:09.500
105.

00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:10.500
105.

00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:11.500
105.

00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:12.500
Can we do 100?

00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:13.500
You know, I'll take 100.

00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:14.500
100?

00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:15.500
Okay.

00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:16.500
I appreciate it.

00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:17.500
All right.

00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:18.500
Have a good one.

00:24:28.069 --> 00:24:29.069
Good dance for Raja.

00:24:29.069 --> 00:24:31.069
Papa Musa.

00:24:31.069 --> 00:24:32.069
Children.

00:24:32.069 --> 00:24:33.069
How are you all?

00:24:33.069 --> 00:24:34.069
Good.

00:24:34.069 --> 00:24:35.069
Very wonderful.

00:24:35.069 --> 00:24:37.069
Look like you're ready for school, huh?

00:24:37.069 --> 00:24:39.069
Now pack your book back so we can go.

00:24:39.069 --> 00:24:40.069
Okay.

00:24:40.069 --> 00:24:41.069
How are you, my dear?

00:24:41.069 --> 00:24:42.069
Good.

00:24:42.069 --> 00:24:43.069
It's good to see you.

00:24:43.069 --> 00:24:44.069
It's a beautiful day.

00:24:44.069 --> 00:24:45.069
Mm-hmm.

00:24:45.069 --> 00:24:47.069
Ah, Jehovah is good to us.

00:24:47.069 --> 00:24:48.069
I was wondering.

00:24:48.069 --> 00:24:49.069
It's a money.

00:24:49.069 --> 00:24:50.069
No.

00:24:50.069 --> 00:24:52.069
He's putting in another long day at the market.

00:24:52.069 --> 00:24:54.069
Ah, shame.

00:24:54.069 --> 00:24:56.069
I was hoping I could talk with him.

00:24:57.069 --> 00:24:59.069
Yeah, he's been on my mind lately.

00:24:59.069 --> 00:25:02.069
You know, I'm kind of worried about him too.

00:25:02.069 --> 00:25:07.069
All they talk about fleeing is bringing back a lot of bad memories for him.

00:25:07.069 --> 00:25:08.069
Yes, yes.

00:25:08.069 --> 00:25:10.069
I remember those days.

00:25:10.069 --> 00:25:11.069
It was tough on them.

00:25:11.069 --> 00:25:12.069
Yeah.

00:25:12.069 --> 00:25:15.069
But it looks like things are coming down.

00:25:15.069 --> 00:25:16.069
Getting back to normal.

00:25:16.069 --> 00:25:18.069
So I'm thankful for that.

00:25:18.069 --> 00:25:22.069
Well, that's what I wanted to talk to a money about.

00:25:22.069 --> 00:25:26.069
You see, some of their family has their deciding to leave.

00:25:26.069 --> 00:25:27.069
Really?

00:25:27.069 --> 00:25:28.069
Why?

00:25:28.069 --> 00:25:33.069
Do you think things are getting worse?

00:25:33.069 --> 00:25:36.069
You never know about these things.

00:25:36.069 --> 00:25:38.069
But we have to remain watchful.

00:25:38.069 --> 00:25:47.309
This is News Radio 93.6.

00:25:47.309 --> 00:25:50.309
As an update to our reporting from yesterday,

00:25:50.309 --> 00:25:55.309
the leaders from both sides have agreed to meet and discuss bringing peace to the region.

00:25:56.309 --> 00:25:58.309
The talks are set for tomorrow morning.

00:25:58.309 --> 00:26:01.309
Now let's go to our correspondent who's asked you to be.

00:26:01.309 --> 00:26:04.309
And we ask who led up to these negotiations.

00:26:04.309 --> 00:26:06.309
What can you tell us?

00:26:06.309 --> 00:26:07.309
Yes.

00:26:07.309 --> 00:26:10.309
Many have been fleeing the violence to find tape here across the borders.

00:26:10.309 --> 00:26:54.299
But with peace talks...

00:26:54.299 --> 00:26:55.299
You got this?

00:26:55.299 --> 00:26:56.299
Yep.

00:26:56.299 --> 00:27:55.470
Let's do it.

00:27:55.470 --> 00:27:56.470
We need to go.

00:27:56.470 --> 00:27:57.470
Damn.

00:27:57.470 --> 00:27:58.470
We just got here.

00:27:58.470 --> 00:27:59.470
I know.

00:27:59.470 --> 00:28:03.000
We are leaving.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.000
We're near.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.000
My brother, how are you?

00:28:10.579 --> 00:28:11.579
To meet this man.

00:28:12.579 --> 00:28:13.579
Bakari!

00:28:13.579 --> 00:28:14.579
No, Bakari!

00:28:14.579 --> 00:28:16.579
I wanted to talk to you about it.

00:28:16.579 --> 00:28:17.579
You meet him first.

00:28:17.579 --> 00:28:19.579
To meet my man.

00:28:19.579 --> 00:28:21.579
That's my brother.

00:28:21.579 --> 00:28:23.579
So...

00:28:23.579 --> 00:28:25.579
You are a man.

00:28:25.579 --> 00:28:27.579
Yes.

00:28:27.579 --> 00:28:29.579
I hear you are quite talented.

00:28:29.579 --> 00:28:30.579
Very much.

00:28:30.579 --> 00:28:31.579
Thank you.

00:28:32.579 --> 00:28:34.579
We're excited to work with you.

00:28:34.579 --> 00:28:38.220
And that must be your boy.

00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:39.220
Hello.

00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:40.220
Hey.

00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:44.220
Are you ready to work with your dad before this new work

00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:46.220
and huge contract coming his way?

00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:49.220
You are our country's future.

00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:50.220
Remember that.

00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:51.220
Thank you.

00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:53.220
Listen, Dania.

00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:54.220
I'm sorry.

00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:56.220
I appreciate this offer.

00:28:57.220 --> 00:28:59.220
But I can't accept it.

00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:02.220
He doesn't know what it's saying now.

00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:04.220
We can't still work out the details.

00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:05.220
And then...

00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:06.220
He'll come back.

00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:07.220
He's okay.

00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:10.220
See all those people out there?

00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:11.220
Yeah.

00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:13.220
They would love to work with me.

00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:16.220
This is not an offer you refuse.

00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:18.220
And you...

00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:22.220
You said this was all done and you had it all covered.

00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:23.220
He'll be fine.

00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:24.220
Fix it!

00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:26.220
And don't waste my time.

00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:28.220
Benia, you have to let me explain.

00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:30.220
Explain what, Amani.

00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:32.220
How could you embarrass me like that in front of him?

00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:33.220
You don't understand.

00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:34.220
Understand what?

00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:37.220
This is a lifetime deal for the family.

00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:39.220
You see why I don't bring big contract to you?

00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:46.940
I can't believe you.

00:29:46.940 --> 00:29:47.940
How could you refuse that?

00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:48.940
Hold on, hold on.

00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:49.940
In front of him.

00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:52.940
I can't believe this.

00:29:56.019 --> 00:29:57.019
You're cold, dude.

00:29:57.019 --> 00:30:00.140
You're cold, dude.
