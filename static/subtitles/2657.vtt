00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.720
The seahorse has a very unusual feature for a fish,

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.720
a prehensal or grasping tail.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.719
This tail can anchor the seahorse to one spot,

00:00:18.719 --> 00:00:21.719
resisting the ocean currents that surround it.

00:00:21.719 --> 00:00:26.440
How does it work?

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.440
The cross section of the seahorse's tail is square,

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.439
not round like that of most other animals with gripping tails.

00:00:33.439 --> 00:00:35.439
In contrast with the round shape,

00:00:35.439 --> 00:00:38.439
this square shape allows the tail to contact a greater area

00:00:38.439 --> 00:00:40.439
of the surface being gripped,

00:00:40.439 --> 00:00:43.439
making it more difficult to dislodge.

00:00:43.439 --> 00:00:49.439
It can also twist and untwist with minimal energy.

00:00:49.439 --> 00:00:52.439
In addition, the tail of the seahorse is encased

00:00:52.439 --> 00:00:56.439
in overlapping bony plates with many joints.

00:00:56.439 --> 00:00:59.439
When subjected to a potentially harmful force,

00:00:59.439 --> 00:01:03.439
the plates slide over one another, absorbing the energy.

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:07.439
This can prevent damage to the seahorse's spinal column.

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.439
The design of the seahorse's tail could be applied

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.439
to search and rescue robots,

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:15.439
which need to be strong and capable of bending

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:18.439
and twisting in tight spaces.

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:22.439
The same properties could be useful in some surgical equipment.

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.439
According to Professor Ross Hatton,

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:27.439
human engineers tend to build things that are stiff

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:29.439
so they can be controlled easily,

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:33.439
but nature makes things just strong enough not to break

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:36.439
and then flexible enough to do a wide range of tasks.

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:39.439
That's why we can learn a lot from animals

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:43.439
that will inspire the next generations of robotics.

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.439
What do you think?

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:50.439
Did the seahorses tail evolve or was it designed?
