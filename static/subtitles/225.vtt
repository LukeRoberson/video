00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:14.300
The governing body would like to share with the Bessel family some information on the reasons behind a number of major decisions affecting the worldwide work and particularly those in special full-time service.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:22.300
As you know in the next few months a good number of special full-time servants will be returning to the ranks of the regular pioneers.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.300
Why is this necessary?

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:34.299
First we would like to make clear that we are confident that Jehovah is richly blessing the worldwide work.

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:40.299
Also the financial support of our brothers has in no way diminished.

00:00:40.299 --> 00:00:52.299
In fact we have even seen a fine increase in contributions since the May 2015 program on JW Broadcasting.

00:00:52.299 --> 00:01:01.299
However as the global preaching work has expanded over the past several years our expenses have greatly increased.

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:06.299
For instance we have experienced a tremendous growth in personnel.

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:16.299
As of September the 1st 2015 we reached 83,790 in special full-time service.

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:23.299
Can you imagine the cost involved to care for so many special full-time servants?

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:29.299
At the same time many of our major branch facilities are more than 30 years old.

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:34.299
These offices require extensive maintenance and renovation.

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:39.299
In some cases new branch facilities are needed.

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:46.299
Also consider that we will soon have literature available in some 850 languages.

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:54.799
This translation work requires additional facilities and personnel.

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:59.799
Finally consider the thousands of kingdom halls that we need to construct.

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:09.800
Not just in lands with limited resources but in Europe and the United States where one kingdom hall may cost more than a million dollars.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:21.719
It was obvious to the governing body that we could not expect our brothers to continually increase their donations.

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:28.719
We needed to reduce expenses. To accomplish this we would need to reduce personnel.

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:31.719
Reduce the number of publications we are printing.

00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:41.719
Put some non-essential construction projects on hold and reduce or eliminate various services at Bethel.

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:45.719
What has been the response to these adjustments?

00:02:45.719 --> 00:02:54.719
We have been overwhelmed by the positive willing spirit of all you dear brothers and sisters to make these adjustments a success.

00:02:54.719 --> 00:02:58.719
We have truly felt your whole hearted support.

00:02:59.719 --> 00:03:08.719
Therefore we now look to Jehovah to bless these adjustments so that we can move ahead with the all important preaching work.

00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:13.719
All to the glory and praise of our magnificent God.

00:03:13.719 --> 00:03:23.719
We trust that these comments will help you to understand our current situation and to know that we truly love and appreciate each one of you.

00:03:23.719 --> 00:03:29.719
With all good wishes your brothers governing body of Jehovah's Witnesses.
