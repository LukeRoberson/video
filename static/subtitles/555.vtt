00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:06.719
To begin our discussion of the text, we invite you to go back to Hebrews chapter 6 and verse 10.

00:00:06.719 --> 00:00:10.720
And let's look at the early part of that verse.

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.720
Hebrews 6 10 says,

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:19.719
For God is not unrighteous so as to forget your work and the love you showed for His name.

00:00:19.719 --> 00:00:25.719
For a few moments we'd like to talk about Jehovah not being unrighteous.

00:00:25.719 --> 00:00:28.719
The opposite of unrighteous would be righteous.

00:00:28.719 --> 00:00:31.719
Well, what does righteous mean?

00:00:31.719 --> 00:00:38.719
It's a person who, in the case of Jehovah, always does the right thing.

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:42.719
He's never acting in an unjust manner.

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.719
He's always fair. He's always going to do the right thing.

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:52.719
And that's the point that Deuteronomy chapter 32 and verse 4 shares with us.

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:55.719
The rock perfect is His activity.

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:58.719
For all His ways are justice.

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:05.719
A God of faithfulness who is never unjust righteous and upright is He.

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:08.719
So we concur with the feelings of Abraham.

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:12.719
Remember his conversation with Jehovah about Simon Gomorrah?

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:16.719
What did Abraham say about Jehovah doing the right thing?

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:19.719
He said it, Genesis chapter 18,

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:27.719
It is unthinkable that you would act in this way by putting the righteous man to death with the wicked.

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:29.719
And he said it again.

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:31.719
It is unthinkable of you.

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:32.719
And then he says,

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:36.719
Will not the judge of all the earth do what is right?

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:40.719
So one of the most encouraging aspects of this text is,

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:42.719
Jehovah can be relied on.

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:44.719
He doesn't change.

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:50.719
He is not going to forget and act in a way other than what is the right and the fair thing to do.

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:54.719
And that reassures us greatly, doesn't it?

00:01:54.719 --> 00:02:05.719
And we do our very best to imitate Jehovah in this matter of recognizing to the proper degree and commending to the proper degree our fellow workers and showing appreciation.

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:07.719
What can help us do this?

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:13.719
We invite you to open your Bibles to the book of 1 Peter chapter 3.

00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:15.719
And let's look at verse 8.

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:18.719
That's 1 Peter chapter 3 and verse 8.

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:27.719
Notice some qualities that are essential to our being able to imitate Jehovah in showing respect and appreciation.

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:28.719
It says,

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:32.719
Finally, all of you have unity of mine,

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:34.719
fellow feeling,

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:36.719
brotherly affection,

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:38.719
tender compassion,

00:02:38.719 --> 00:02:40.719
and humility.

00:02:40.719 --> 00:02:44.719
Now, how will these qualities help us to imitate Jehovah?

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:48.719
Well, let's talk just for a moment about fellow feeling.

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:55.719
How could that help us not take for granted what our brothers and sisters do as our fellow workers?

00:02:55.719 --> 00:03:01.719
Well, we might begin to ask ourselves some questions as we observe our hardworking fellow workers.

00:03:01.719 --> 00:03:03.719
We could pick out someone and say,

00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:07.719
How would I feel if I had that assignment?

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:09.719
How hard that must be?

00:03:09.719 --> 00:03:13.719
Look at their unselfishness that they show.

00:03:13.719 --> 00:03:16.719
How tired they must be at times.

00:03:16.719 --> 00:03:21.719
And look at how long they've been hailing the same assignment for so long.

00:03:21.719 --> 00:03:23.719
And then we could ask ourselves,

00:03:23.719 --> 00:03:26.719
If I had that assignment to perform,

00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:30.719
How would I feel if someone recognized me with proper commendation?

00:03:30.719 --> 00:03:33.719
And then we could ask ourselves,

00:03:33.719 --> 00:03:37.719
How would I feel if no one never said anything?

00:03:37.719 --> 00:03:42.719
That fellow feeling helps us to understand what we would need

00:03:42.719 --> 00:03:44.719
and how our brothers would need the same.

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:48.719
It reminds us of Matthew chapter 7 and verse 12, doesn't it?

00:03:48.719 --> 00:03:51.719
All things, therefore, that you want men to do to you,

00:03:51.719 --> 00:03:56.719
you must also do to them.

00:03:56.719 --> 00:03:58.719
Now, in this connection,

00:03:58.719 --> 00:04:03.719
there was a motivational trainer who worked in the secular field,

00:04:03.719 --> 00:04:08.719
and he talked about the relationship between employers and employees.

00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:11.719
Well, we're not employers and employees, we're fellow workers.

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:13.719
But there's a principle here.

00:04:13.719 --> 00:04:15.719
He said often when dealing with companies,

00:04:15.719 --> 00:04:18.720
he would often hear the complaint from the employees

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.720
that their employer rarely, if ever, committed them.

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.720
And he said in his studies,

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.720
that is sometimes legitimate.

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.720
But he said, what bothered the employees the most was,

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.720
they felt there was a lack of personal interest.

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.720
Well, how does that relate?

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.720
Well, when we have fellow feeling,

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.720
brotherly affection,

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.720
we're going to take a personal interest in our brothers.

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.720
And we're going to view them as having value and worth.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.720
It will affect how we talk to them, how we treat them,

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.720
how we show them that we honor them and respect them,

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.720
and we value them.

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.720
When we do that,

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.720
we don't always have to say, thank you,

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.720
they know that we love them and appreciate them,

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.720
by the way we deal with them.

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.720
However, the fact is,

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.720
if we have brotherly affection and fellow feeling

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.720
and tender compassion in our heart for our fellow workers,

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.720
what's going to happen?

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.720
What does Luke 645 say?

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.720
A good man brings good out of the good treasure of his heart,

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:29.720
and out of the heart's abundance is mouth speeds.

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:31.720
So we can't help,

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:34.720
but just express how we feel about each other

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:37.720
when those qualities are in our heart.

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.720
And in this way,

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.720
we're imitating Jehovah,

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:44.720
who always does the right thing in dealing with us.

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:50.060
But now let's take a few moments to talk about a situation

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:55.060
where we may not always think that recognition or commendation

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:58.060
would be appropriate.

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:00.060
Let's take, for example,

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:03.060
one of our fellow workers

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:05.060
could be a brother or a sister,

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:07.060
but in this case, we're going to use a brother,

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:11.060
and this brother has served faithfully for many years.

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:15.060
Conscientious, trustworthy, spiritual,

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:18.060
he's poured his heart into his assignment,

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:22.060
and then due to negligence,

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:25.060
a lapse in good judgment,

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:29.060
or caving into a fleshly weakness,

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:33.060
he is counseled, perhaps even disciplined,

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:37.439
and even loses a privilege of service.

00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:41.439
Now, what might that person be going through?

00:06:41.439 --> 00:06:44.439
Well, in this case, let's say that this person,

00:06:44.439 --> 00:06:46.439
our fellow worker,

00:06:46.439 --> 00:06:49.439
is humble, he was honest,

00:06:49.439 --> 00:06:52.439
he admitted his mistake, he sought help,

00:06:52.439 --> 00:06:54.439
he accepted the counsel,

00:06:54.439 --> 00:06:57.439
but now he's having to deal with putting his hand

00:06:57.439 --> 00:07:00.439
to the plow and move ahead, he doesn't want to stop.

00:07:00.439 --> 00:07:04.100
He has a great attitude.

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:09.100
Well now, what could be commended in this situation?

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:13.100
Well, he certainly would want to commend for negligence,

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:15.100
or lack of good judgment,

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:18.100
or failing to exercise self-control.

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:21.100
But what does Jehovah see in this person now,

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:23.100
with the good attitude that we describe?

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:26.100
The honesty, the humility, the endurance,

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:29.100
the determination to move forward?

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:32.100
Well, Jehovah loves that person.

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:35.100
Jehovah loves that person when he discipline them.

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:39.100
And then in Hebrews chapter 12, verses 12 and 13,

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:43.100
Jehovah says to those who have gone through a difficult time like that,

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:47.100
strengthen the hands that hang down in the feeble knees,

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:51.100
and keep making straight paths for your feet

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:54.100
so that you make it healed.

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:57.100
So Jehovah still loves that person.

00:07:57.100 --> 00:08:01.100
And now this reminds us too of King David

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:05.100
after his sins in Psalm 40, verse 12,

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:08.100
and notice the feeling that he had.

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:14.100
He said, so many of my errors overwhelm me that I cannot see my way.

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:16.100
They are more numerous than the hairs of my head,

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:19.100
and I have lost heart.

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:23.100
But then in the next Psalm, Psalm 41,

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:25.100
he says, as for me,

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:31.100
you Jehovah uphold me because of my integrity.

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:35.100
You will keep me in your presence forever.

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:37.100
So what do our brothers need at a time like that?

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:40.100
When their attitude is good,

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:42.100
they need to be reminded that we love them

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:44.100
just as Jehovah loves them.

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:47.100
And we commend them for their honesty and their humility

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:51.100
and their stick-tuitiveness and not quitting.

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:55.100
And we know that Jehovah views them as precious,

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:57.100
especially with their good attitude.

00:08:57.100 --> 00:09:00.100
And all those treasures that they had stored up in heaven

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:02.100
prior to their difficulty,

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:05.100
has Jehovah thrown those treasures out?

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:08.100
No, he still retains them,

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:11.100
and he's more than happy for them to start putting more treasures

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:15.100
up in heaven because he appreciates it very much.

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:19.100
So like Paul said to the congregation in Corinth

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:22.100
at 2 Corinthians 2 6 through 8,

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:25.100
after the man who sinned seriously was repentant,

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:28.100
what did Paul say?

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:30.100
This rebuke given by the majority

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:32.100
is sufficient for such a man.

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:34.100
And then he goes on to say,

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:39.100
I therefore exhort you to confirm your love for him.

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:43.100
And one way we can do that is by appropriately

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:48.100
and to the proper degree at the right time,

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:51.100
commending him for his excellent attitude

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:54.100
and his willingness not to stop.

00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:57.100
Well, that's just another example of how

00:09:57.100 --> 00:10:00.100
Jehovah doesn't forget works of his servants

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:02.100
and neither should we.

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:04.100
So in imitation of Jehovah,

00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:08.100
let's always strive to do the right thing, the fair thing.

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:11.100
Let's have the fellow feeling as we do,

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:14.100
let's continue with it, the compassion

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:16.100
and the love for each other.

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:19.100
And then that would automatically make others feel

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:21.100
needed, wanted and appreciated,

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:24.100
and we can add to that by expressions from our heart,

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:28.100
telling them directly how much we value them.

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:32.100
By doing this, we will be imitating our appreciative God

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:37.100
who always does the right thing to those who serve Him.
