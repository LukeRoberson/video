00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:21.629
Jehovah cherishes all who serve him loyally, regardless of their circumstances.

00:00:21.629 --> 00:00:27.670
Do you truly understand why Jehovah loves those who situation in life may be very different

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:29.949
from your own?

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:38.100
If so, you are in a much better position to show them your love and support.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.740
Please listen closely as Brother William Mellonfont, a helper to the Teaching Committee, begins

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:50.380
this symposium with the talk, successful fighters for the faith, those with unbelieving

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.219
mates.

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:55.659
Each speaker will then introduce the one to follow.

00:00:55.659 --> 00:01:05.260
Brother Mellonfont, you have our attention.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:15.459
Jehovah God's inspired word makes this significant declaration at Titus, chapter 2, and

00:01:15.459 --> 00:01:17.060
verse 11.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.019
It reads,

00:01:19.019 --> 00:01:27.819
For the undeserved kindness of God has been manifested, bringing salvation to all sorts

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:29.140
of people.

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.700
Yes, to all sorts of people.

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:40.140
This was true in the first century, and it's true today more than ever before.

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:46.260
We are a worldwide brotherhood made up of all sorts of people who have come to a knowledge

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:52.900
of the truth, and we have made the decision to serve Jehovah.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.780
In this symposium, we will discuss three sorts of people.

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:07.500
First, those whose mates are not yet Jehovah's Witnesses, second, those who are being raised

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:16.139
by one believing parent or relative, and third, those who are single.

00:02:16.139 --> 00:02:21.860
Many brothers and sisters who find themselves in these situations are successfully putting

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:28.300
up a hard fight for the faith as stated in Jude, verse 3.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:33.539
And all of them are valuable assets to the congregation.

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:41.460
So as we discuss each situation during this symposium, please focus your attention on those

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:47.900
who are in the congregation that you attend and ask yourself.

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:55.580
How can I show my appreciation for brothers and sisters who have these circumstances?

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:04.580
And ask yourself, if I am in one of the situations being discussed, what will help me to continue

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.800
to fight successfully for the faith?

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:16.159
This talk will focus on Christians with unbelieving mates.

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:22.280
For a well-known example, we look back to the first century to a woman named Eunice, the

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.599
mother of Timothy.

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:31.879
She is referred to in Acts 161, which says that Timothy was the son of a believing Jewish

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:35.919
woman, but of a Greek father.

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:42.199
So it refers to Eunice as a believing woman, but it does not refer to Timothy's father

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:44.520
as a believing man.

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:49.680
The point is that Timothy's father was not a Christian.

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:55.900
Nevertheless, Eunice, his mother, along with Lois, his grandmother, taught Timothy the

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:03.199
holy writings, the truth as found in God's Word.

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:12.080
When we speak of unbelieving mates, we recognize that their circumstances are not all the same.

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.519
Some non-witness mates oppose true worship.

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:24.639
Others are indifferent, and others may be tolerant, even somewhat interested and supportive,

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:29.720
but they may not be progressing toward baptism.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:36.160
Some mates of believers are baptized, but they have weakened spiritually.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:44.120
They may no longer be regular at meetings, go in service, or participate in family worship.

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:52.639
And last of all, sad to say, some mates are disfellowshipped, but we never give up on

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:59.480
unbelieving mates, and we always hope that any who are disfellowshipped will come to

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:06.360
their senses, repent, and return to Jehovah.

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:12.000
Is there something that we as publishers in the congregation can do to show appreciation

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.879
for fellow believers whose mates are not yet serving Jehovah?

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:19.800
Yes, there is.

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:27.680
And the Apostle Paul tells us at Philippians chapter 3, verse 17, that we can learn from

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:31.519
their good example and imitate them.

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:36.279
Philippians chapter 3, verse 17 says,

00:05:36.279 --> 00:05:44.759
"...unitedly become imitators of me, brothers, and keep your eye on those who are walking

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:50.920
in a way that is in harmony with the example we set for you."

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:59.839
So Paul tells us to look closely at his example and the fine example of others in the congregation.

00:05:59.839 --> 00:06:06.920
Among those setting a fine example are brothers and sisters who have unbelieving mates.

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:11.759
They have worked hard to maintain a strong relationship with Jehovah.

00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:17.720
They have cultivated self-discipline to keep a good schedule of theocratic activities.

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:25.720
And many have become proficient in balancing family obligations with spiritual pursuits.

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:31.160
It's not easy, but they are doing it.

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:36.399
So how should we view them and treat them?

00:06:36.399 --> 00:06:41.199
We do what Philippians chapter 2, verse 4 tells us to do.

00:06:41.199 --> 00:06:48.920
We look out not only for our own interests, but also for the interests of others.

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:53.160
That means that we show concern for their well-being.

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:56.079
We treat them with respect.

00:06:56.079 --> 00:06:58.639
We certainly do not ignore them.

00:06:58.639 --> 00:07:05.040
We recognize that as spiritual people, they have much to offer.

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:12.839
Isn't it wonderful that we are family and we belong to one another?

00:07:12.839 --> 00:07:17.720
We take brothers and sisters who have unbelieving mates into account.

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:24.120
And we look out for their interests as the scripture states because we love them and

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:27.160
we see their good qualities.

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:31.600
So what can we do?

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:37.240
Whenever possible, we should include them in our activities.

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:40.680
But what else can we do?

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:47.040
We can show interest in their mates and try to help them spiritually.

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:56.000
For example, if circumstances allow, invite them with their mates for a meal or to a gathering.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.600
You know that friendliness and upbuilding conversation can have a powerful effect on a person's

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:03.680
heart.

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:11.199
As you watch the following video, think about how you can show appreciation for any in your

00:08:11.199 --> 00:08:18.399
congregation whose mates are not presently serving Jehovah.

00:08:18.399 --> 00:08:23.079
It was when my husband was really opposed.

00:08:23.079 --> 00:08:33.039
One night, he put a knife to his stomach and said, will you choose me or the truth?

00:08:33.039 --> 00:08:36.240
My husband was cooperative.

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:40.759
He would wave goodbyes we went to the meetings.

00:08:40.759 --> 00:08:45.320
But he wasn't interested at all.

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:53.009
I felt really jealous when I saw families sitting together at assemblies.

00:08:53.009 --> 00:09:00.610
Because of work and taking care of his mother, my husband gradually started missing meetings.

00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:05.850
I'm in our congregation with good intentions pointed it out to him.

00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:11.929
But the way they did this made him feel misunderstood and discouraged.

00:09:11.929 --> 00:09:15.450
And he put the Bible and the publications away.

00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:23.629
I also had times when I wanted to drift away with him.

00:09:23.629 --> 00:09:27.549
I was really happy when I learned the truth.

00:09:27.549 --> 00:09:33.149
In my zeal, I bombarded my husband with information and that made him worry that I had turned

00:09:33.149 --> 00:09:36.070
into a fanatic.

00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:41.389
I think he was genuinely concerned for his family and thought that I had joined a weird

00:09:41.389 --> 00:09:44.700
religion.

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:50.100
One family in the congregation often invited us to meals and outdoor activities.

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:55.100
I think my husband appreciated those small acts of kindness.

00:09:55.100 --> 00:10:02.149
I also tried to show that I appreciated him through my speech and conduct.

00:10:02.149 --> 00:10:08.549
When my children and I applied what we learned in our lives, I think he gradually became interested

00:10:08.549 --> 00:10:11.309
in the truth.

00:10:11.309 --> 00:10:16.070
The words safeguard your heart caught my eye.

00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:24.669
I decided to try and keep my heart and my children's hearts towards Jehovah.

00:10:24.669 --> 00:10:30.549
When I went out in the ministry with my children, I would point out various aspects of God's

00:10:30.549 --> 00:10:33.309
creation around us.

00:10:33.309 --> 00:10:38.830
And before my husband would come home from work, I made it a habit to teach them God's

00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:40.629
word.

00:10:40.629 --> 00:10:47.110
I made a conscious effort to see myself in paradise with my husband.

00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:52.230
This strengthened my resolve to never leave the truth.

00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:57.269
I wrote caring notes to my husband when I went to the meetings.

00:10:57.269 --> 00:11:02.789
I was convinced that he would come back one day.

00:11:02.789 --> 00:11:05.549
And he did come back.

00:11:05.549 --> 00:11:12.389
I did not leave Jehovah and so Jehovah never abandoned me.

00:11:12.389 --> 00:11:15.950
My husband never embraced the truth.

00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:26.110
However, right now, all five of my children are in the truth and I feel really blessed.

00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:33.230
Being able to serve Jehovah as a family, along with my husband, the joy and appreciation

00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:38.820
just keep dwelling up.

00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:42.620
What did we learn from the video?

00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:48.740
We learned that believing mates who display fine Christian qualities can have a positive

00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:53.179
influence on mates who are not yet serving Jehovah.

00:11:53.179 --> 00:11:59.220
So what will help you to keep on fighting for the faith?

00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:04.059
Wisdom and strength that only Jehovah can provide.

00:12:04.059 --> 00:12:12.379
Remember, his power is unlimited and he finds pleasure in showing favor to those who trust

00:12:12.379 --> 00:12:14.899
in him.

00:12:14.899 --> 00:12:20.740
So you know that he loves you and that he listens to sincere prayers from those who want

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:24.669
to do things his way.

00:12:24.669 --> 00:12:31.710
The combination of God's love, prayer and his spirit can give you the strength and the

00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:38.789
wisdom you need to maintain a balanced routine of spiritual activities while making sure to

00:12:38.789 --> 00:12:44.149
care for your family responsibilities.

00:12:44.149 --> 00:12:50.950
In the video, the believing mates took advantage of all the spiritual food that was available

00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:53.990
to build themselves up.

00:12:53.990 --> 00:13:00.590
And Jehovah helped them to display the spiritual qualities of patience and tact.

00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:07.190
You know as well as I do that at times we may not be as tactful as we should be.

00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:14.549
Being patient and tactful is not always easy, especially when you're tired and feel

00:13:14.549 --> 00:13:19.470
disappointed by your mates' words or actions.

00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:27.590
And yet, regardless of your situation, Jehovah can supply you with the power to keep setting

00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:37.129
a fine example as you keep on praying that your mate will eventually respond to the truth.

00:13:37.129 --> 00:13:46.370
First Peter, chapter three, verses one and two, first Peter, three, one and two.

00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:51.529
We find this very wise and practical counsel.

00:13:51.529 --> 00:14:00.210
First Peter, three, one and two reads, in the same way you wives be in subjection to your

00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:08.009
husbands, so that if any are not obedient to the Word, they may be one without a Word

00:14:08.009 --> 00:14:11.610
through the conduct of their wives.

00:14:11.610 --> 00:14:20.049
Because of having been eyewitnesses of your chaste conduct together with deep respect.

00:14:20.049 --> 00:14:22.610
Isn't that wonderful?

00:14:22.610 --> 00:14:27.570
The counsel that Peter gives is tested and true.

00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:35.330
This application has helped an untold number of unbelieving mates to accept the truth.

00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:42.929
And when you think about it, it truly is amazing how deep respect and fine conduct can

00:14:42.929 --> 00:14:49.289
win over an unbelieving mate without a Word being spoken.

00:14:49.289 --> 00:14:54.610
Of course, as you work what is good towards your mate, there undoubtedly will be opportunities

00:14:54.610 --> 00:15:01.649
to speak about the truth and provide spiritual assistance when circumstances permit and

00:15:01.649 --> 00:15:04.370
it seems appropriate.

00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:12.590
So keep on setting a fine example and praying that your mate will respond to the truth.

00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:19.549
Have faith in the inspired words that Paul wrote at 1 Corinthians chapter seven and

00:15:19.549 --> 00:15:21.830
verse sixteen.

00:15:21.830 --> 00:15:30.070
1 Corinthians seven sixteen and remember to continue to show a positive attitude towards

00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:31.990
your mate.

00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:39.750
1 Corinthians seven sixteen poses two questions, but with a positive slant, chapter seven

00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:47.669
and verse sixteen read, for wife, how do you know whether you will save your husband?

00:15:47.669 --> 00:15:53.350
For husband, how do you know whether you will save your wife?

00:15:53.350 --> 00:16:00.750
Yes, this text is telling us to remain positive about the possibility of a mate taking the

00:16:00.750 --> 00:16:02.509
truth.

00:16:02.509 --> 00:16:09.190
And it is a fact that many unbelieving mates have accepted the truth because of observing

00:16:09.190 --> 00:16:13.629
a husband or a wife who follows God's direction.

00:16:13.629 --> 00:16:22.190
Therefore, we continue to hope, wholeheartedly, that in time unbelieving mates will respond

00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:27.629
to the truth and find pleasure in serving Jehovah.

00:16:27.629 --> 00:16:35.909
As you apply divine counsel from God's Word, be assured that with Jehovah's help, you can

00:16:35.909 --> 00:16:45.600
continue to be a successful fighter for the faith and bring honor to Jehovah God.

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:51.720
Brother Seth Hyatt, a helper to the service committee, will consider the next talk.

00:16:51.720 --> 00:17:04.920
Successful fighters for the faith, those being raised by single parents.

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:12.720
At Psalm 68 verse five, Jehovah is called a father of the fatherless.

00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:15.319
Are you a fatherless child?

00:17:15.319 --> 00:17:22.640
Or do you have a fatherless child or fatherless children in your congregation?

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:29.200
You may be wondering, what do we mean by fatherless child?

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:35.880
Well in the context of our discussion, we're talking about young people who have only one

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:40.079
believing parent, one parent in the truth.

00:17:40.079 --> 00:17:43.599
Now that allows for a spectrum of possibilities.

00:17:43.599 --> 00:17:46.680
It could be a single parent family.

00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:54.279
It could be a religiously divided family and especially when the unbeliever is opposed.

00:17:54.279 --> 00:18:04.170
It could even include a situation where only one parent is actively serving Jehovah.

00:18:04.170 --> 00:18:09.569
I was five years old when my mother learned the truth from the Bible.

00:18:09.569 --> 00:18:16.009
For some years I lived in a religiously divided home and eventually my mother became a single

00:18:16.009 --> 00:18:21.369
parent and we dealt with those circumstances.

00:18:21.369 --> 00:18:27.890
There are many of us here at Bethel, in the field pioneering, serving as missionary, circuit

00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:37.329
overseers, construction workers, many of us who experienced similar circumstances.

00:18:37.329 --> 00:18:43.490
Being lay in the Bible, Jehovah saw fit to include the life experience of a young man

00:18:43.490 --> 00:18:48.049
who grew up in a religiously divided home.

00:18:48.049 --> 00:18:59.130
Timothy, the Bible describes him as having a believing Jewish mother, but a Greek father.

00:18:59.130 --> 00:19:04.809
He had only one parent who served Jehovah.

00:19:04.809 --> 00:19:12.490
Now we know that his mother, Yunus and his grandmother, Lojas, were instrumental in helping

00:19:12.490 --> 00:19:16.609
him become well-founded in the truth.

00:19:16.609 --> 00:19:22.809
But the scriptures indicate others had a share in his spiritual advancement as well.

00:19:22.809 --> 00:19:27.450
And that's where all of us come into this conversation.

00:19:27.450 --> 00:19:36.250
All of us, like Jehovah, need to appreciate the fatherless children and our congregations.

00:19:36.250 --> 00:19:40.329
We should view them as modern-day Timothy's.

00:19:40.329 --> 00:19:41.569
How do we do that?

00:19:41.569 --> 00:19:47.609
Well, we can learn a lot from the Apostle Paul.

00:19:47.609 --> 00:19:57.009
Late in the year 49 or early 50 CE, the Apostle Paul on his second missionary journey visited

00:19:57.009 --> 00:20:03.650
the city of Lystra and there he observed Timothy.

00:20:03.650 --> 00:20:10.130
Not just in a casual way, Paul really saw Timothy.

00:20:10.130 --> 00:20:17.849
He observed his potential and he took the initiative to provide training so that Timothy

00:20:17.849 --> 00:20:21.609
could realize that potential.

00:20:21.609 --> 00:20:24.930
That's a beautiful example for us.

00:20:24.930 --> 00:20:35.089
We need to take note of and encourage the fatherless children in our midst.

00:20:35.089 --> 00:20:42.210
The Apostle Paul set a nice example in something that he wrote to Timothy.

00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:52.450
In the year 65 CE, Paul was a prisoner in Rome with no prospect of being released.

00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:57.170
In fact, his death was imminent.

00:20:57.170 --> 00:21:03.690
Time to write one more letter, to whom did he write?

00:21:03.690 --> 00:21:09.089
To Timothy, his beloved child in the faith.

00:21:09.089 --> 00:21:14.930
And what did he have to say to Timothy in this last inspired letter?

00:21:14.930 --> 00:21:16.529
Let's read it together.

00:21:16.529 --> 00:21:26.680
Timothy chapter 1, 2 Timothy chapter 1 verse 5.

00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:34.160
For I recall your unhypocritical faith, which dwelled first in your grandmother Loas and

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:41.960
your mother Unas, but which I am confident is also in you.

00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:45.640
Did you notice what Paul did?

00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:54.119
In just a few words, he commended and expressed confidence in Timothy.

00:21:54.119 --> 00:21:58.400
But he also commended Timothy's mother and grandmother, didn't he?

00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:02.319
For their unhypocritical faith.

00:22:02.319 --> 00:22:10.160
For Loas and Unas, serving Jehovah was not playhacking, their faith was genuine.

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:16.039
What a blessing for Timothy that proved to be.

00:22:16.039 --> 00:22:26.960
Well, in a similar way, we can offer specific, sincere, heartfelt commendation to fatherless

00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:36.200
children and their parents and commend them for what they're able to do, include them

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:41.559
in spiritual and recreational activities.

00:22:41.559 --> 00:22:46.920
When I was a boy, my grandmother used to pick me up every Saturday morning and take me

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:49.240
in the ministry.

00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:55.000
I never had to wonder if she was coming, and I never had to wonder who I would work with.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:02.240
The book study conductor, an older brother, would always include my grandmother and me

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:05.319
in the group with him and his wife.

00:23:05.319 --> 00:23:09.119
I cherish those memories.

00:23:09.119 --> 00:23:15.720
Pay close attention now, as some who grew up in single-parent homes explained how they

00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:24.460
were encouraged to be successful fighters for the faith.

00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:27.660
It felt like a bad dream.

00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:31.579
Our family were really zealous in the truth.

00:23:31.579 --> 00:23:36.819
We were playing downstairs one day, and Mum came down to tell us she was leaving Jehovah

00:23:36.819 --> 00:23:42.339
and leaving Dad, saying goodbye to Mum, that was the hardest day of my life.

00:23:42.859 --> 00:23:47.740
My mother and father became inactive when I was about four years old.

00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:51.259
My father was never really around.

00:23:51.259 --> 00:23:55.980
When my Mum started to learn the truth, my Dad said she was forbidden from studying.

00:23:55.980 --> 00:24:00.259
If we were to go to the meetings, he would take us out forcibly.

00:24:00.259 --> 00:24:04.019
He became verbally and physically abusive to my Mum.

00:24:04.019 --> 00:24:07.460
My parents' breakup was very tough.

00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:11.740
It was a struggle for my Mum to raise two boys on her own.

00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:16.859
She would work two or three jobs, and serving Jehovah just took a back seat.

00:24:16.859 --> 00:24:20.740
When my parents divorced, my Mum was very depressed.

00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:25.900
She did the best she could, but Jehovah did an intent for mothers to fill both roles

00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:28.019
as parents.

00:24:28.019 --> 00:24:32.940
My sisters and I, we made a conscious choice that we weren't going to make the same bad

00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:35.019
choices that Mum did.

00:24:35.019 --> 00:24:40.900
We realised that it's up to us, so I dedicated my life to Jehovah and was baptized when

00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:42.700
I was 15.

00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:47.619
We thrived spiritually when we didn't have the opposition from Dad.

00:24:47.619 --> 00:24:50.220
Now we can go out and service, go to the meetings freely.

00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:54.579
We didn't have to hide our literature for fear he would rip them up.

00:24:54.579 --> 00:25:00.700
When I was around 15 years old, my Mum took us to the meeting, and she was determined

00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:03.059
that this was going to be her last meeting.

00:25:03.059 --> 00:25:05.579
It was the night of a local needs party.

00:25:05.579 --> 00:25:11.859
It was the right time Jehovah just opened my Mum's heart, why?

00:25:11.859 --> 00:25:15.700
After that experience, it was like she was a new woman.

00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:18.380
My sisters and I have always been a team.

00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:22.900
We pioneered together, we moved to Cambodia to serve as negrators together.

00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:27.900
They're both in special full-time service with their husbands in Cambodia, and I've been

00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:33.140
serving here in Myanmar Bethel along with my husband for just over 11 years now.

00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:36.059
My Mum set a stellar example for me to follow.

00:25:36.059 --> 00:25:39.980
Her relationship with Jehovah was always above everything else.

00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:45.180
It was her example that helped me to set and reach spiritual goals.

00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:50.500
I started pioneering during my senior year of high school, in nearly 20 years of full-time

00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:56.180
service, spending most of that time at Brooklyn Bethel and Warwick with my wife.

00:25:56.180 --> 00:26:00.900
My Mum had a very strong influence on theocratic goals.

00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:05.980
My wife and I had the privilege of attending the first school, the Kingdom Evangelizers,

00:26:05.980 --> 00:26:09.700
and currently we're serving in the circuit work.

00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:13.019
No one needs to be defined by their negative circumstances.

00:26:13.019 --> 00:26:17.859
First Peter 5-10 says, God Himself will complete your training.

00:26:17.859 --> 00:26:22.660
It might be tough at times, but what Jehovah's help you can succeed.

00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:27.220
It reminds me of what David said in the 27th Psalm in verse 10.

00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:34.259
He said, even if my father or mother abandoned me, Jehovah would take me in.

00:26:34.259 --> 00:26:38.059
That was definitely the case in my situation.

00:26:38.059 --> 00:26:41.700
Jehovah doesn't define us by our upbringing or our past.

00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:44.859
He sees our potential, so it's up to us.

00:26:44.859 --> 00:26:51.359
With Jehovah we can be anything we want to be.

00:26:51.359 --> 00:26:55.799
Well we appreciate those beautiful expressions.

00:26:55.799 --> 00:27:00.279
So those of you who are fatherless children.

00:27:00.319 --> 00:27:03.720
How do you see yourself?

00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:06.960
Do you see yourself as Jehovah sees you?

00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:11.200
As a unique individual with potential?

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:16.160
Certainly you're not inferior in any way because of your circumstance.

00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:20.759
Did you appreciate the comments made by those in the video?

00:27:20.759 --> 00:27:25.759
Your circumstances don't have to define you.

00:27:25.759 --> 00:27:30.960
You've circumstances and upbringing do not have to define you.

00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:37.319
We would add this, your unique experience in life gives you a unique perspective and

00:27:37.319 --> 00:27:43.079
Jehovah may be able to use you to help others.

00:27:43.079 --> 00:27:45.599
So be a Timothy.

00:27:45.599 --> 00:27:52.519
At a young age, relatively speaking, Timothy was a spiritual man entrusted with responsibility.

00:27:52.519 --> 00:27:58.359
The Apostle Paul described him as having a disposition like no one else's.

00:27:58.359 --> 00:28:01.640
Timothy cared for others.

00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:03.440
You can do the same.

00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:04.440
Reach out.

00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:13.200
Be a pioneer, a Bethelite, a field missionary, a construction worker, a circuit overseer.

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:21.240
You young brothers qualify and reach out to be a ministerial servant and then an altar.

00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:24.359
The opportunities are endless.

00:28:24.359 --> 00:28:29.039
Allow Jehovah to use you.

00:28:29.039 --> 00:28:35.599
And continue to cultivate appreciation for your loyal parent.

00:28:35.599 --> 00:28:41.359
I know I appreciate my mother very much for her fine example of faith through a number

00:28:41.359 --> 00:28:44.519
of very trying circumstances.

00:28:44.519 --> 00:28:50.599
We don't take the faithfulness of our single parents for granted.

00:28:50.599 --> 00:28:59.759
Well, in conclusion, we want to assure you that you can be a successful fighter for the

00:28:59.759 --> 00:29:03.160
faith, just as Timothy was.

00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:10.759
We have confidence in you and we pray Jehovah's continued, rich blessing on your service

00:29:10.759 --> 00:29:13.079
to him.

00:29:13.079 --> 00:29:19.079
Brother Joel Dalinger, a helper to the service committee, will consider the final talk of

00:29:19.079 --> 00:29:32.579
this symposium, successful fighters for the faith, single Christians.

00:29:32.579 --> 00:29:39.380
In this symposium, we've been reminded that Jehovah cherishes and empowers those

00:29:39.380 --> 00:29:41.859
who serve him loyally.

00:29:41.859 --> 00:29:47.940
In this concluding part of this symposium, we'll focus on single brothers and sisters.

00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:49.940
Let's answer three questions.

00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:55.579
First, how do we know that married and single Christians all have an honored place in

00:29:55.579 --> 00:29:57.099
the congregation?

00:29:57.099 --> 00:30:04.380
Second, how can we show that we value and support our fellow believers who are not married?

00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:12.420
And third, if you're single, how can you be a successful fighter for the faith?

00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:18.980
To begin, let's briefly consider Jehovah's view of married and single Christians.

00:30:18.980 --> 00:30:23.539
One thing we love about our God is that Jehovah is not partial.

00:30:23.539 --> 00:30:28.980
Regardless of a person's nationality or skin color, anyone who wishes can serve him

00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:30.700
acceptably.

00:30:30.700 --> 00:30:38.339
Jehovah's impartiality also means that he does not favor married or single Christians

00:30:38.339 --> 00:30:40.819
one over the other.

00:30:40.819 --> 00:30:44.900
The remaining single, or getting married, is a personal choice.

00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:51.460
And nowhere does the Bible state that our value to Jehovah is linked to being either single

00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:53.380
or married.

00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:58.220
For example, at Matthew chapter 19 and verse 12, Jesus said that some of his followers

00:30:58.220 --> 00:31:02.859
would choose to remain single on account of the kingdom.

00:31:02.859 --> 00:31:08.900
He then went on to say, let the one who can make room for it make room for it.

00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:11.619
Now think about that for a moment.

00:31:11.619 --> 00:31:17.339
If a Christian younger or older chooses to remain single for the sake of the kingdom,

00:31:17.339 --> 00:31:23.380
Jehovah and Jesus respect such a decision, and they appreciate the good motive behind

00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:26.099
that personal choice.

00:31:26.099 --> 00:31:30.980
Other Christians are unmarried due to circumstances in life.

00:31:30.980 --> 00:31:36.299
For example, some faithful Christians in the congregation are too young to marry.

00:31:36.460 --> 00:31:40.980
The apostles have lost a maid due to death or divorce.

00:31:40.980 --> 00:31:48.099
The Apostle Paul maintained God's impartial view of both single and married Christians.

00:31:48.099 --> 00:31:54.460
Like Jesus, Paul did not teach that Christians should marry or that they should remain single.

00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:58.740
In commenting on Paul's first inspired letter to the Corinthians, the watchtower back

00:31:58.740 --> 00:32:08.380
in 2012 said this, really, both marriage and singleness can be described as gifts from God.

00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:13.940
Jehovah does not view singleness as a cause for shame or grief.

00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:17.339
Singleness may bring a Christian certain advantages.

00:32:17.339 --> 00:32:22.259
An unmarried Christian who is not weighed down with family responsibilities may have more

00:32:22.259 --> 00:32:27.539
time and energy to devote to God's service than a married Christian.

00:32:27.539 --> 00:32:34.380
Of course, single Christians do not view themselves as better than married Christians for this reason.

00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:39.019
The Bible's message, Jehovah's thinking is clear, isn't it?

00:32:39.019 --> 00:32:46.579
Married and single Christians all can have an honored place in the congregation.

00:32:46.579 --> 00:32:49.140
Now let's consider our second question.

00:32:49.140 --> 00:32:57.339
How can we who are married show that we value and support fellow believers who are not married?

00:32:57.339 --> 00:33:04.460
Please open your Bible with me to 1 Corinthians chapter 12 and notice verse 25.

00:33:04.460 --> 00:33:10.980
In the context, we notice that Paul is emphasizing that in the Christian congregation, we need

00:33:10.980 --> 00:33:11.980
one another.

00:33:11.980 --> 00:33:14.420
We depend on one another.

00:33:14.420 --> 00:33:19.099
Just as we need all the parts of our literal body, our eyes, our hands, and our feet,

00:33:19.099 --> 00:33:24.099
all Christians, single and married are valued and needed.

00:33:24.099 --> 00:33:29.500
So how can we show that we appreciate our single brothers and sisters?

00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:32.500
Let's read verse 25.

00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:37.740
So that there should be no division in the body, and here's the point, but its members

00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:43.140
should have mutual concern for one another.

00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:48.859
The study edition of the New World Translation says that this expression have mutual concern

00:33:48.859 --> 00:33:53.819
for one another could also be rendered as be anxious over one another.

00:33:53.819 --> 00:33:56.579
Well, the lesson is clear.

00:33:56.579 --> 00:34:01.940
Married Christians, we show appreciation for single brothers and sisters when we show

00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:08.340
concern for their welfare, whether that's spiritually or physically.

00:34:08.340 --> 00:34:13.860
We do not ignore them, we don't look down on them, nor do we treat them as if we have

00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:17.260
very little in common with them.

00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:22.500
In this regard, the Apostle Paul said an example worthy of imitation.

00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:27.860
He was keenly interested in Timothy's spiritual health and progress.

00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:34.179
Those single, Paul saw potential in Timothy and invested in that spiritual man.

00:34:34.179 --> 00:34:36.820
And what happened as a result?

00:34:36.820 --> 00:34:44.539
An inexperienced, young single Christian became an excellent overseer.

00:34:44.539 --> 00:34:49.260
And when the two of them, Paul and Timothy were no longer traveling together, Paul continued

00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:52.699
to show genuine interest in Timothy's welfare.

00:34:52.699 --> 00:34:58.139
We know that because he wrote two letters that Jehovah has preserved for our benefit in

00:34:58.139 --> 00:35:00.139
the Holy Scriptures.

00:35:00.139 --> 00:35:06.019
Now can you imagine how Timothy must have felt to have received a letter from his older

00:35:06.019 --> 00:35:08.059
friend Paul?

00:35:08.059 --> 00:35:14.300
For just a moment, let's put ourselves in Timothy's sandals as we listen to just a few lines

00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:17.420
from Paul's first letter.

00:35:17.420 --> 00:35:24.380
To Timothy, a genuine child in the faith, may you have undeserved kindness and mercy and

00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:28.780
peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.

00:35:28.780 --> 00:35:32.500
A little later in the letter, Timothy would have read this,

00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:38.019
this instruction I entrust to you, my child Timothy, in harmony with the prophecies

00:35:38.019 --> 00:35:45.139
that were made about you, that by these you may go on waging the fine warfare.

00:35:45.139 --> 00:35:51.099
Then there was this encouragement, do not neglect the gift in you that was given you

00:35:51.099 --> 00:35:56.579
through a prophecy when the body of elders laid their hands on you.

00:35:56.579 --> 00:36:02.940
Do you think those words of encouragement reassured Timothy and made him feel appreciated

00:36:02.940 --> 00:36:04.739
without a doubt?

00:36:04.739 --> 00:36:11.260
In the same letter Paul went on to express concern about Timothy's frequent cases of sickness.

00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:16.960
Paul's concerned for Timothy's welfare, his spiritual and physical welfare, no doubt

00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:22.340
touched Timothy's heart and encouraged him to move forward in Jehovah's service.

00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:27.460
And Paul's example touches our heart as well.

00:36:27.460 --> 00:36:33.820
We may be moved to ask ourselves, is there more I can do to look out for the needs of

00:36:33.820 --> 00:36:39.179
single ones who are exerting themselves in God's service?

00:36:39.179 --> 00:36:49.579
Do I wrongly view single ones as incomplete, inferior, or lacking, or do I show them honor?

00:36:49.579 --> 00:36:54.300
As a traveling overseer, Timothy was a success.

00:36:54.300 --> 00:37:00.940
Paul did not look down on him, rather Paul chose Timothy, a single Christian for weighty

00:37:00.940 --> 00:37:07.300
assignments, and gave him the training he needed in order to succeed.

00:37:07.300 --> 00:37:13.099
Today I'm sure you and I can think of many practical ways that we can demonstrate our

00:37:13.099 --> 00:37:19.219
concern for the welfare of our fellow believers who are unmarried.

00:37:19.219 --> 00:37:26.260
The August 2020 issue of the Watchtower provided this reminder in a study article, I read.

00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:31.059
We do well to keep in mind that those some single Christians have made it a personal

00:37:31.059 --> 00:37:33.500
goal to remain unmarried.

00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:38.980
Other Christians would like to marry, but they simply have not found the right person.

00:37:38.980 --> 00:37:42.659
Still others may have lost their mate in death.

00:37:42.659 --> 00:37:47.739
In any case, should those in the congregation feel the need to ask single Christians why

00:37:47.739 --> 00:37:54.260
they are not married, or to offer help to find a mate?

00:37:54.260 --> 00:37:58.500
Can we reason on Jehovah's thinking as found in the Scriptures?

00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:00.900
We know the answer to that question.

00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:05.739
We do not need to ask single ones when they are getting married, nor do we need to pair

00:38:05.739 --> 00:38:09.980
them up with other single ones if they have not requested our help.

00:38:09.980 --> 00:38:17.460
Instead, we should look for ways to commend them, for their fine example, and assure them

00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:21.219
that we love and appreciate them.

00:38:21.219 --> 00:38:25.739
In the following dramatization, please note what an elder learned about the challenges

00:38:25.739 --> 00:38:30.389
faced by single ones.

00:38:30.389 --> 00:38:34.389
Brothers, it's hard to believe this is our last time together.

00:38:34.389 --> 00:38:40.150
Wow, we have the Peck Agenda, so let's get started.

00:38:40.150 --> 00:38:45.070
This is our last week with our Circuit Overseer before he leaves us for his new Circuit

00:38:45.070 --> 00:38:46.070
assignment.

00:38:46.070 --> 00:38:52.510
Rick's been a great Circuit Overseer, spiritually mature, experienced, and patient with

00:38:52.510 --> 00:38:53.510
us.

00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:54.510
Tom?

00:38:54.510 --> 00:38:55.510
You thought?

00:38:55.510 --> 00:39:03.829
Rick is single, and sadly, there were plenty times we turned that gift into a challenge,

00:39:03.829 --> 00:39:05.829
ever since his first visit.

00:39:05.829 --> 00:39:06.829
Hello, Jeff.

00:39:06.829 --> 00:39:20.150
Yeah, have a minute.

00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:21.150
Oh, that.

00:39:21.150 --> 00:39:22.150
Longing night.

00:39:22.150 --> 00:39:23.150
My washing machine is a clanker.

00:39:23.150 --> 00:39:32.710
I just assumed a single brother had lots of free time.

00:39:32.710 --> 00:39:37.349
I didn't know how much he had to do on his own.

00:39:37.349 --> 00:39:40.550
But there was a lot more I didn't understand.

00:39:40.550 --> 00:39:42.550
I got it, yes.

00:39:42.550 --> 00:39:43.550
Hello, bye.

00:39:43.550 --> 00:39:44.550
Hey.

00:39:44.550 --> 00:39:45.550
Look.

00:39:45.550 --> 00:39:53.519
They have something there.

00:39:53.519 --> 00:39:55.559
It sounds like a great Bible study.

00:39:55.559 --> 00:39:57.360
I can't wait to meet her.

00:39:57.360 --> 00:39:58.360
Thank you for that.

00:39:58.360 --> 00:39:59.360
See you then.

00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:00.360
See ya.

00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:01.360
That's you.

00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:02.360
That's you.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:07.519
I don't know what you're waiting for.

00:40:07.519 --> 00:40:09.519
For what?

00:40:09.519 --> 00:40:10.519
Come on.

00:40:10.519 --> 00:40:13.800
A single Circuit Overseer, a Pioneer Sister.

00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:19.000
You've got to be looking for a CEO wife.

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:23.480
Well, the teasing was so inappropriate.

00:40:23.480 --> 00:40:29.170
And was there at every visit.

00:40:29.170 --> 00:40:38.300
Then there were those trying to be, how should I say, helpful?

00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:43.260
Look, you want to meet them.

00:40:43.260 --> 00:40:47.579
And so I invite them for lunch Saturday.

00:40:47.579 --> 00:40:49.980
Rick never asked for that help.

00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:53.539
All it did was put him and plenty of sisters

00:40:53.539 --> 00:40:55.780
in an awkward situation.

00:40:55.780 --> 00:41:00.539
That's what he dealt with week after week.

00:41:00.539 --> 00:41:04.139
We all failed at times to see past the single person

00:41:04.139 --> 00:41:09.059
to the spiritual man giving Jehovah his best.

00:41:09.059 --> 00:41:10.619
We'll miss you.

00:41:10.619 --> 00:41:15.099
Just maybe not as much as some of the sisters.

00:41:15.099 --> 00:41:17.579
I didn't want to make that mistake again

00:41:17.579 --> 00:41:19.860
with any single brother or sister.

00:41:19.860 --> 00:41:22.420
Rick, Jeff, thank you.

00:41:22.420 --> 00:41:24.219
I learned a lot from you.

00:41:24.219 --> 00:41:27.139
And I hope Jehovah blesses you wherever you go.

00:41:27.139 --> 00:41:32.750
Thanks, Ray.

00:41:32.750 --> 00:41:36.150
Let's now consider our final point.

00:41:36.150 --> 00:41:42.510
If you're single, you too can be powerful by faith.

00:41:42.510 --> 00:41:44.309
But how?

00:41:44.309 --> 00:41:47.469
A great help in building faith is by setting

00:41:47.469 --> 00:41:50.469
and reaching spiritual goals.

00:41:50.469 --> 00:41:53.909
Of Abraham, Romans chapter 4 and verse 20 says,

00:41:53.909 --> 00:41:57.510
because of the promise of God, he did not waver

00:41:57.510 --> 00:41:59.550
in a lack of faith.

00:41:59.550 --> 00:42:03.429
Like Abraham, we encourage you single brothers and sisters

00:42:03.429 --> 00:42:07.070
to frequently meditate on God's promises.

00:42:07.070 --> 00:42:11.030
Thinking often about how Jehovah has kept every promise

00:42:11.030 --> 00:42:15.190
to us in the past, how he's keeping his promises now,

00:42:15.190 --> 00:42:18.190
surely encourages us to remember that he

00:42:18.190 --> 00:42:23.150
will keep every promise that he has made for our future.

00:42:23.150 --> 00:42:26.710
Doing so strengthens our faith.

00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:29.949
Like Jesus, like Paul, like Timothy.

00:42:29.949 --> 00:42:32.750
Talk about Jehovah's promises with others

00:42:32.789 --> 00:42:36.550
by zealously sharing in the field ministry.

00:42:36.550 --> 00:42:39.909
And please, do not isolate yourself

00:42:39.909 --> 00:42:42.510
from others in the congregation, thinking

00:42:42.510 --> 00:42:45.349
that you have very little to contribute.

00:42:45.349 --> 00:42:48.670
No, you have much to contribute

00:42:48.670 --> 00:42:53.269
as a faithful brother or sister in the Christian congregation.

00:42:53.269 --> 00:42:56.949
We warmly encourage you to reach out and associate

00:42:56.949 --> 00:42:59.949
with spiritually mature ones in your congregation,

00:42:59.949 --> 00:43:02.550
whether single or married.

00:43:02.550 --> 00:43:06.110
Like Timothy, ponder over these things.

00:43:06.110 --> 00:43:09.030
Be absorbed in spiritual pursuits

00:43:09.030 --> 00:43:14.269
so that your advancement may be plainly manifest to all.

00:43:14.269 --> 00:43:18.190
Remember, you are needed and loved.

00:43:20.190 --> 00:43:21.750
Well, what have all of us learned

00:43:21.750 --> 00:43:24.869
in this faith, strengthening and encouraging symposium?

00:43:25.869 --> 00:43:30.070
Please open your Bible with me to Hebrews chapter 11.

00:43:30.110 --> 00:43:32.230
Starting in verse 4, you'll notice,

00:43:32.230 --> 00:43:36.110
as you scan the verses, that many familiar names

00:43:36.110 --> 00:43:39.190
of men and women of faith are outlined for us.

00:43:39.190 --> 00:43:43.590
There's Abel and Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Sarah,

00:43:43.590 --> 00:43:47.309
Rahab, Gideon, and David, and many more.

00:43:48.269 --> 00:43:49.429
All of these men and women

00:43:49.429 --> 00:43:52.070
had different circumstances in life.

00:43:52.070 --> 00:43:53.469
It's true.

00:43:53.469 --> 00:43:56.269
But what did they all have in common?

00:43:56.269 --> 00:43:59.989
Notice Hebrews chapter 11 and verse 34.

00:43:59.989 --> 00:44:02.269
In the middle of the verse, it tells us,

00:44:02.269 --> 00:44:06.030
they were made powerful.

00:44:06.030 --> 00:44:10.949
Yes, they were made powerful by faith.

00:44:10.949 --> 00:44:13.150
And the same is happening today,

00:44:13.150 --> 00:44:18.150
in every congregation of Jehovah's people, earth wide.

00:44:18.150 --> 00:44:22.110
Young ones, older ones, men and women,

00:44:22.110 --> 00:44:25.269
regardless of our family circumstances,

00:44:25.269 --> 00:44:29.269
all of us are being made powerful by faith.

00:44:29.309 --> 00:44:32.070
So dear brothers and sisters,

00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:37.070
please be assured that we love you and appreciate you.

00:44:37.309 --> 00:44:39.989
And may Jehovah bless your efforts

00:44:39.989 --> 00:44:46.110
to be a successful fighter for the faith.

00:44:46.110 --> 00:44:49.349
Thank you, brothers, for those loving talks.

00:44:50.750 --> 00:44:53.789
The time has now arrived for the baptism discourse.

00:44:54.789 --> 00:44:57.150
We invite all baptism candidates

00:44:57.150 --> 00:44:58.989
to pay particular attention.

00:44:59.989 --> 00:45:03.989
And the days ahead, how can you further strengthen your faith?

00:45:05.309 --> 00:45:08.949
Why can you be confident that Jehovah will reward your faith?

00:45:10.590 --> 00:45:12.829
Listen closely to the answers presented

00:45:12.829 --> 00:45:14.949
in the discourse entitled,

00:45:14.949 --> 00:45:18.269
exercising faith means everlasting life.

00:45:19.309 --> 00:45:21.989
The talk will be given by Brother John Echron,

00:45:21.989 --> 00:45:31.260
a helper to the coordinators committee.

00:45:31.260 --> 00:45:33.860
All of us around the world rejoice

00:45:33.900 --> 00:45:36.300
with you baptismal candidates.

00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:39.300
This is a very special occasion for you.

00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:42.059
Today you will join millions of your brothers and sisters

00:45:42.059 --> 00:45:44.980
in a very special relationship with Jehovah.

00:45:46.340 --> 00:45:48.059
I want you to imagine for a moment

00:45:48.059 --> 00:45:51.059
that you're in a very large stadium,

00:45:51.059 --> 00:45:53.139
and there's eight and a half million

00:45:53.139 --> 00:45:56.300
of your brothers and sisters all in this stadium

00:45:56.300 --> 00:45:59.980
clapping and so happy to see the stand

00:45:59.980 --> 00:46:01.940
you're taking for Jehovah today.

00:46:02.940 --> 00:46:06.019
Some of you are young ones that are raised in the truth

00:46:06.019 --> 00:46:08.380
and you're sitting with your parents and family.

00:46:09.380 --> 00:46:12.099
Others of you may have known the truth years ago

00:46:12.099 --> 00:46:14.059
and have recently returned to Jehovah.

00:46:15.059 --> 00:46:17.579
Others may have learned the truth recently

00:46:17.579 --> 00:46:20.019
and even under these unusual circumstances

00:46:20.019 --> 00:46:22.380
of a pandemic in Zoom meetings

00:46:22.380 --> 00:46:26.300
have come to the point of dedicating your life to Jehovah.

00:46:27.579 --> 00:46:29.659
Whatever your circumstances,

00:46:29.659 --> 00:46:32.619
we are so happy that you've made the decision

00:46:32.619 --> 00:46:33.820
to get baptized.

00:46:34.900 --> 00:46:38.980
Now the theme of our talk with you baptism candidates

00:46:38.980 --> 00:46:42.619
is exercising faith means everlasting life.

00:46:43.739 --> 00:46:46.980
There's two key words here, exercising and faith.

00:46:48.099 --> 00:46:51.780
Faith is your trust and confidence in Jehovah

00:46:51.780 --> 00:46:53.820
and his promises.

00:46:53.820 --> 00:46:57.380
And exercising your faith is living your life

00:46:57.380 --> 00:46:58.500
to do God's will.

00:47:00.019 --> 00:47:03.420
You've shown your faith by working hard

00:47:03.420 --> 00:47:05.539
to qualify for baptism today.

00:47:06.940 --> 00:47:10.820
Now faith is a little bit like building a wood fire.

00:47:10.820 --> 00:47:12.179
If you want to build a fire,

00:47:12.179 --> 00:47:15.500
you first have to collect some small pieces of wood

00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:17.579
and then later you need to have on hand

00:47:17.579 --> 00:47:20.860
some larger pieces of wood to keep the fire going.

00:47:22.219 --> 00:47:27.059
Likewise, your baptism today is the start of your fire of faith.

00:47:28.059 --> 00:47:31.219
Now it's not easy to start a fire at times.

00:47:31.219 --> 00:47:35.019
The wood may be wet, the wind keeps blowing out your flame.

00:47:36.139 --> 00:47:37.900
Likewise, it may not have been easy for you

00:47:37.900 --> 00:47:39.699
to get the fire of your faith started.

00:47:40.659 --> 00:47:43.380
You have taken the time and effort

00:47:43.380 --> 00:47:46.059
to build your fire of faith.

00:47:47.380 --> 00:47:50.139
Now you need to keep that fire of faith burning.

00:47:50.980 --> 00:47:52.340
Why?

00:47:52.340 --> 00:47:55.380
Well, because our faith can become weak

00:47:55.420 --> 00:47:59.059
unless we work to keep it strong.

00:47:59.059 --> 00:48:02.219
On one occasion, Jesus said to some of his disciples

00:48:02.219 --> 00:48:03.420
that they had little faith.

00:48:03.420 --> 00:48:10.610
Let's look at that in Matthew chapter 17 and verse 20.

00:48:10.610 --> 00:48:12.250
Matthew 17, 20.

00:48:13.929 --> 00:48:15.210
He said to them,

00:48:15.210 --> 00:48:17.489
because of your little faith,

00:48:17.489 --> 00:48:19.409
for truly I say to you,

00:48:19.409 --> 00:48:22.969
if you have faith the size of a mustard grain,

00:48:22.969 --> 00:48:24.849
you will say to this mountain,

00:48:24.849 --> 00:48:27.650
move from here to there and it will move.

00:48:27.650 --> 00:48:30.570
And nothing will be impossible for you.

00:48:32.250 --> 00:48:33.690
Jesus was letting them know

00:48:33.690 --> 00:48:36.690
that they needed to make their faith stronger.

00:48:37.650 --> 00:48:39.889
Now after a fire gets started,

00:48:39.889 --> 00:48:43.170
it can often get very large and very hot.

00:48:43.170 --> 00:48:47.010
But if there's no wood added to the fire, what happens?

00:48:47.010 --> 00:48:50.849
It soon goes out and turns to just cold ashes.

00:48:51.969 --> 00:48:57.130
So in order for us to keep our fire of faith burning,

00:48:57.130 --> 00:48:58.730
we need to keep feeding it.

00:48:59.889 --> 00:49:03.050
Likewise, your fire of faith needs constant attention

00:49:03.050 --> 00:49:05.130
to keep burning hot and bright.

00:49:06.210 --> 00:49:08.530
Let's consider three questions.

00:49:09.610 --> 00:49:13.409
One, how can you feed your fire of faith?

00:49:13.409 --> 00:49:18.130
Two, what does it mean to exercise faith?

00:49:18.130 --> 00:49:22.570
And three, how will Jehovah reward your faith?

00:49:24.090 --> 00:49:26.010
Before we answer those questions, though,

00:49:26.010 --> 00:49:28.730
we will talk to two baptized witnesses

00:49:28.730 --> 00:49:32.489
who have taken steps to make their faith stronger.

00:49:34.050 --> 00:49:36.449
First, let's talk to Yoni Palmo.

00:49:37.409 --> 00:49:38.690
Brother Palmo and his wife,

00:49:38.690 --> 00:49:41.010
Ellie, serve at Bethel in Finland

00:49:41.010 --> 00:49:44.650
and he has faithfully served Jehovah for 60 years.

00:49:44.650 --> 00:49:46.010
And I want you to note,

00:49:46.010 --> 00:49:49.730
what help Brother Palmo face a test of his faith

00:49:49.730 --> 00:49:51.329
early in his binary?

00:49:52.449 --> 00:49:54.409
Brother Palmo, can you recall a time

00:49:54.409 --> 00:49:55.809
when you had little faith?

00:49:56.889 --> 00:49:59.210
Yes, I can recall,

00:50:00.210 --> 00:50:04.809
when I was 17, I moved to serve as an auxiliary pioneer

00:50:05.809 --> 00:50:09.570
with an isolated group far away from my home.

00:50:11.010 --> 00:50:13.809
There, I faced very religious people

00:50:13.809 --> 00:50:17.730
who were convinced that we witnesses were wrong

00:50:17.730 --> 00:50:19.969
and that I was badly misled.

00:50:20.969 --> 00:50:23.969
There are questions about cryptos

00:50:23.969 --> 00:50:26.969
I never encountered in my former territory.

00:50:27.969 --> 00:50:31.969
The people were very convincing with their arguments

00:50:31.969 --> 00:50:34.969
and I felt confused and lost.

00:50:36.369 --> 00:50:39.969
I asked myself, are there other questions, too?

00:50:39.969 --> 00:50:41.570
I don't have answers, too.

00:50:42.570 --> 00:50:47.570
And this started little, my little watering me

00:50:47.570 --> 00:50:49.570
and tested my faith.

00:50:50.969 --> 00:50:53.369
So there you were, young and isolated

00:50:53.369 --> 00:50:55.369
with all those questions.

00:50:55.369 --> 00:50:58.369
What did you do to strengthen your faith?

00:50:58.369 --> 00:51:01.369
I didn't have bound volumes,

00:51:01.369 --> 00:51:05.969
nor was the library or those kinds of tools.

00:51:05.969 --> 00:51:09.369
So I wrote a letter to my Leslie Brothers

00:51:09.369 --> 00:51:11.769
who at that time went prison

00:51:11.769 --> 00:51:14.369
because of refusing military service.

00:51:15.369 --> 00:51:19.369
I knew that they had all of our literates there

00:51:19.369 --> 00:51:25.719
and they were studying every day the Bible-like scholars.

00:51:26.119 --> 00:51:29.119
They saw my situation

00:51:29.119 --> 00:51:34.119
and they sent me a letter with answers to all my questions.

00:51:34.920 --> 00:51:38.719
I was so happy and thank to Hova

00:51:38.719 --> 00:51:41.320
it really strengthened my faith.

00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:46.519
Kehova used your brothers in prison to help you.

00:51:46.519 --> 00:51:48.519
So how do you think you benefited

00:51:48.519 --> 00:51:49.920
from strengthening your faith?

00:51:51.320 --> 00:51:55.320
This experience was decisive, a hallmark

00:51:55.320 --> 00:51:57.719
to my whole spiritual life.

00:51:57.719 --> 00:52:01.320
I understood the value of accurate knowledge

00:52:01.320 --> 00:52:04.920
and I studied to collect a library of my own.

00:52:05.920 --> 00:52:08.719
I still have my early library

00:52:08.719 --> 00:52:13.860
and to me it is something very special.

00:52:13.860 --> 00:52:17.260
This experience happened 56 years ago

00:52:17.260 --> 00:52:21.460
and since then I have not had any such doubts.

00:52:21.460 --> 00:52:26.059
The Hova has given us all the answers we need to know

00:52:26.059 --> 00:52:29.460
and even if there are questions

00:52:29.460 --> 00:52:33.059
we don't have answers to at the moment.

00:52:33.059 --> 00:52:37.059
I have faith that they will be answered by the Hova

00:52:37.059 --> 00:52:38.860
in his new time.

00:52:40.179 --> 00:52:41.739
Thank you, Brother Palmo.

00:52:41.739 --> 00:52:44.380
Your experience really helps us to appreciate

00:52:44.380 --> 00:52:51.239
the Bible's answers to life's most complex questions.

00:52:51.239 --> 00:52:53.639
Next we can talk to Frankie Brown.

00:52:53.639 --> 00:52:56.440
Brother Brown and his wife Karen serve at Bethel

00:52:56.440 --> 00:52:58.440
in the United States.

00:52:58.440 --> 00:53:00.239
And I want you to pay close attention

00:53:00.239 --> 00:53:02.639
to what helped Brother Brown to make the decision

00:53:02.639 --> 00:53:05.440
to dedicate his life to Jehovah.

00:53:05.440 --> 00:53:07.639
Brother Brown, can you recall a time

00:53:07.639 --> 00:53:10.239
when you had little faith?

00:53:10.239 --> 00:53:13.440
Until the age of 12, I was raised by my grandmother

00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:15.639
who studied with Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:53:15.639 --> 00:53:17.840
This is how I was introduced to the truth

00:53:17.840 --> 00:53:20.639
and I studied off and on growing up.

00:53:20.639 --> 00:53:23.639
At 17, like many young people,

00:53:23.639 --> 00:53:27.440
I faced a decision of what to do with my life after school.

00:53:27.440 --> 00:53:29.840
Many around me just assumed I'd go off to college

00:53:29.840 --> 00:53:31.639
and pursue a career.

00:53:31.639 --> 00:53:33.639
However, for my study of the Bible,

00:53:33.639 --> 00:53:37.639
I knew I had another choice to make to serve Jehovah.

00:53:37.639 --> 00:53:39.840
This was a big decision for me.

00:53:39.840 --> 00:53:43.039
At times, I had no idea what I wanted to do.

00:53:43.039 --> 00:53:46.440
I was inexperienced and unsure about whose advice to take.

00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:50.440
The Bibles or that of well-meaning family and friends.

00:53:50.440 --> 00:53:54.840
That's quite a challenging decision for you at that age to make.

00:53:54.840 --> 00:53:57.639
What did you do to strengthen your faith?

00:53:57.639 --> 00:54:00.440
I realized that I needed to know Jehovah better

00:54:00.440 --> 00:54:02.639
and what was involved in serving him.

00:54:02.639 --> 00:54:06.440
So I resumed my Bible study and attendance at Christian meetings.

00:54:06.440 --> 00:54:09.239
I also began to do personal study.

00:54:09.239 --> 00:54:12.440
One personal study project was Psalm 119.

00:54:12.440 --> 00:54:15.039
This beautiful Psalm helped me to view Jehovah

00:54:15.039 --> 00:54:17.639
as the loving father I never had.

00:54:17.639 --> 00:54:21.039
It also helped me to see the wisdom of living in harmony

00:54:21.039 --> 00:54:23.039
with the Bible standards.

00:54:23.039 --> 00:54:26.639
For example, Psalm 119.99 says,

00:54:26.639 --> 00:54:30.039
I have more insight than all my teachers

00:54:30.039 --> 00:54:33.639
because I ponder over your reminders.

00:54:33.639 --> 00:54:36.840
Essentially, the Psalmist was saying that Jehovah

00:54:36.840 --> 00:54:39.440
was his guidance counselor.

00:54:39.440 --> 00:54:42.440
Also, I benefited from the good example

00:54:42.440 --> 00:54:45.639
of the brothers and sisters in my congregation.

00:54:45.639 --> 00:54:48.840
They had already made the decision to serve Jehovah.

00:54:48.840 --> 00:54:52.840
And from their life, it was obvious they were truly happy

00:54:52.840 --> 00:54:54.840
and had a meaningful life.

00:54:54.840 --> 00:54:57.639
This convinced me that serving Jehovah

00:54:57.639 --> 00:55:00.239
that was the best way to use my life.

00:55:00.239 --> 00:55:03.239
I thanked Jehovah for their good example

00:55:03.239 --> 00:55:08.239
and for their efforts to help me at a time when I needed more faith.

00:55:08.239 --> 00:55:11.239
Your personal study and help from the brothers and sisters

00:55:11.239 --> 00:55:14.639
in your congregation really helped you.

00:55:14.639 --> 00:55:18.639
So how do you think you benefited from strengthening your faith?

00:55:18.639 --> 00:55:21.440
I got baptized, started pioneering,

00:55:21.440 --> 00:55:24.239
and some years later was invited to Bethel.

00:55:24.239 --> 00:55:28.440
From my youth onward, I have found security and stability

00:55:28.440 --> 00:55:30.840
in my relationship with Jehovah.

00:55:30.840 --> 00:55:34.239
When I look back on my decision to dedicate my life to Jehovah

00:55:34.239 --> 00:55:38.239
without a doubt, that's the best decision I've ever made.

00:55:38.239 --> 00:55:41.639
Whether young or old, Jehovah will not let you down

00:55:41.639 --> 00:55:44.039
when you need him the most.

00:55:44.039 --> 00:55:48.840
Thank you, Brother Brown, you made a good choice.

00:55:48.840 --> 00:55:51.039
Let's go back to our three questions.

00:55:51.039 --> 00:55:53.440
Consider our first question.

00:55:53.440 --> 00:55:57.440
How can you feed the fire of your faith?

00:55:57.440 --> 00:56:01.239
Well, the Bible is our main source of fuel

00:56:01.239 --> 00:56:04.239
to feed the fire of our faith.

00:56:04.239 --> 00:56:07.639
To feed the fire of our faith, we need to do two things.

00:56:07.639 --> 00:56:12.239
We need to read God's Word and meditate on it.

00:56:12.239 --> 00:56:17.039
Now, reading God's Word is like adding wood to our fire.

00:56:17.039 --> 00:56:21.639
And meditation is a lot like fanning the flames.

00:56:21.639 --> 00:56:24.239
Let's discuss these one at a time.

00:56:24.239 --> 00:56:31.440
First, let's use the example of the Psalmist in Psalm chapter 1

00:56:31.440 --> 00:56:34.239
verses 1 through 3.

00:56:34.239 --> 00:56:39.320
Psalm chapter 1 verses 1 through 3.

00:56:39.320 --> 00:56:42.719
Happy is the man who does not walk according to the advice

00:56:42.719 --> 00:56:47.119
of the wicked, and does not stand on the path of sinners,

00:56:47.119 --> 00:56:50.119
and does not sit in the seat of scoffers.

00:56:50.119 --> 00:56:53.320
But his delight is in the law of Jehovah,

00:56:53.320 --> 00:56:58.519
and he reads his law in an undertone day and night.

00:56:58.519 --> 00:57:02.519
He will be like a tree planted by streams of water,

00:57:02.519 --> 00:57:05.519
a tree that produces fruit in its season,

00:57:05.519 --> 00:57:07.920
the foliage of which does not wither,

00:57:07.920 --> 00:57:11.920
and everything he does will succeed.

00:57:11.920 --> 00:57:15.119
Well, we want to be like that man in this Psalm.

00:57:15.119 --> 00:57:18.519
His delight is in the law of Jehovah.

00:57:18.519 --> 00:57:23.119
When we find delight or pleasure in reading God's Word,

00:57:23.119 --> 00:57:26.719
it's not like we have to read God's Word,

00:57:26.719 --> 00:57:30.119
we want to read God's Word.

00:57:30.119 --> 00:57:33.920
He reads his law day and night.

00:57:33.920 --> 00:57:38.719
Jehovah wants us to read his Word often.

00:57:38.719 --> 00:57:43.119
Prayer is when we speak to Jehovah.

00:57:43.119 --> 00:57:47.920
But reading the Bible is when he speaks to us.

00:57:47.920 --> 00:57:50.320
I'd like you to notice the beautiful mental picture

00:57:50.320 --> 00:57:54.619
that Isaiah gives us of how Jehovah speaks to us

00:57:54.619 --> 00:57:59.619
in Isaiah chapter 30 and verse 21.

00:57:59.619 --> 00:58:03.619
Isaiah chapter 30 and verse 21.

00:58:03.619 --> 00:58:06.820
And your own ears will hear a word behind you saying,

00:58:06.820 --> 00:58:11.719
this is the way, walk in it in case you should go to the right

00:58:11.719 --> 00:58:16.119
or in case you should go to the left.

00:58:16.119 --> 00:58:22.219
Well, why do we hear Jehovah's voice behind us instead of in front of us?

00:58:22.219 --> 00:58:25.219
Well, for one thing, Jehovah's words in the Bible

00:58:25.219 --> 00:58:28.420
were written many years ago or we could say

00:58:28.420 --> 00:58:32.420
in the time or past behind us.

00:58:32.420 --> 00:58:35.219
But there's another way to visualize this verse.

00:58:35.219 --> 00:58:38.820
Maybe you've been with a group with some small children

00:58:38.820 --> 00:58:42.820
and you're walking somewhere where often are the children.

00:58:42.820 --> 00:58:47.719
They're out in front running ahead, even if they don't really know where they're going.

00:58:47.719 --> 00:58:51.119
And what do the parents behind have to do?

00:58:51.119 --> 00:58:53.920
Well, they have to call to them and say, no, no, no, not that way.

00:58:53.920 --> 00:58:56.719
We're going to the left here and the children run back

00:58:56.719 --> 00:59:00.920
and that's the direction that they go in.

00:59:00.920 --> 00:59:05.920
Surely we want to listen carefully for Jehovah's voice behind us

00:59:05.920 --> 00:59:10.719
helping us to make the right decisions.

00:59:10.719 --> 00:59:15.420
Try to schedule Bible reading as part of your daily routine.

00:59:15.420 --> 00:59:18.820
As a suggestion, you can use the schedule for Bible reading

00:59:18.820 --> 00:59:21.420
that's found on jdb.org.

00:59:21.420 --> 00:59:24.619
To find it, type schedule for Bible reading

00:59:24.619 --> 00:59:27.820
in the search field at the top right.

00:59:27.920 --> 00:59:32.119
If you read just three to five chapters every day,

00:59:32.119 --> 00:59:37.320
you can complete the entire Bible in just one year.

00:59:37.320 --> 00:59:40.619
But simply reading God's Word is not enough.

00:59:40.619 --> 00:59:45.619
You need to meditate on what you're reading.

00:59:45.619 --> 00:59:50.920
Or why should you meditate on what you read in God's Word?

00:59:50.920 --> 00:59:55.119
Well, it's because knowing what the right thing is to do

00:59:55.219 --> 00:59:59.019
and doing it are not the same.

00:59:59.019 --> 01:00:02.519
Meditation is the process of converting knowledge.

01:00:02.519 --> 01:00:08.920
That is what we know into wise decisions and actions.

01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:13.420
The Bible often associates meditation with the heart.

01:00:13.420 --> 01:00:15.219
Now why is that?

01:00:15.219 --> 01:00:17.719
Because meditation can convert knowledge.

01:00:17.719 --> 01:00:20.619
That is what we know into feelings.

01:00:20.619 --> 01:00:24.420
And it is those feelings that drive our actions

01:00:24.420 --> 01:00:26.619
and decisions.

01:00:26.619 --> 01:00:31.119
We could kind of think of meditation like a bridge.

01:00:31.119 --> 01:00:33.820
On this side of the river, we have knowing

01:00:33.820 --> 01:00:35.420
what is the right thing to do.

01:00:35.420 --> 01:00:39.219
And on this side, we have actually doing it.

01:00:39.219 --> 01:00:43.019
Meditation is the bridge that closes the gap

01:00:43.019 --> 01:00:45.920
between knowing and doing.

01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:48.019
And if we find ourselves always kind of knowing

01:00:48.019 --> 01:00:51.619
what the right thing is to do, but not actually doing it,

01:00:51.619 --> 01:00:55.920
meditation is the bridge to help us close that gap

01:00:55.920 --> 01:01:00.230
between knowing and doing.

01:01:00.230 --> 01:01:03.329
Well, how can you meditate on God's Word?

01:01:03.329 --> 01:01:06.429
Well, after reading a portion of the Bible

01:01:06.429 --> 01:01:09.130
or one of our publications,

01:01:09.130 --> 01:01:13.530
take a few moments to think deeply about what you have read.

01:01:13.530 --> 01:01:15.429
Ask yourself,

01:01:15.429 --> 01:01:21.079
what do I learn about Jehovah when I read this account?

01:01:21.079 --> 01:01:25.579
How does this account make me feel about Jehovah?

01:01:25.579 --> 01:01:28.179
How can I apply this in my life?

01:01:28.179 --> 01:01:33.429
Or how can I use this to help others?

01:01:33.429 --> 01:01:36.329
So let's review our first question.

01:01:36.329 --> 01:01:40.530
How can you feed the fire of your faith?

01:01:40.530 --> 01:01:46.230
Read and meditate on God's Word each day.

01:01:46.230 --> 01:01:48.829
Let's look at our second question.

01:01:48.829 --> 01:01:53.230
What does it mean to exercise faith?

01:01:53.230 --> 01:01:56.130
Well, Jesus told us that more was required

01:01:56.130 --> 01:01:58.530
than just believing in Him.

01:01:58.530 --> 01:02:01.329
Let's read John chapter 3 and verse 16

01:02:01.329 --> 01:02:07.699
to see the emphasis that Jesus put on exercising faith.

01:02:07.699 --> 01:02:11.199
John chapter 3 and verse 16.

01:02:11.199 --> 01:02:13.500
For God loved the world so much

01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:16.099
that He gave His only begotten Son

01:02:16.099 --> 01:02:20.300
so that everyone exercising faith in Him

01:02:20.300 --> 01:02:26.699
might not be destroyed but have ever lasting life.

01:02:26.699 --> 01:02:31.800
So what then does it mean to exercise faith?

01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:35.099
A study note on this verse explains

01:02:35.099 --> 01:02:38.099
to exercise faith includes the idea

01:02:38.099 --> 01:02:41.599
of demonstrating one's strong beliefs or faith

01:02:41.599 --> 01:02:45.099
by obeying God.

01:02:45.099 --> 01:02:47.400
Now Abraham was a powerful example

01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:50.900
of proving his faith by obedience.

01:02:50.900 --> 01:02:54.699
Let's look at a very wonderful description

01:02:54.699 --> 01:02:58.699
of Abraham's faith in James chapter 2

01:02:58.699 --> 01:03:03.139
and verses 21 through 23.

01:03:03.139 --> 01:03:08.179
James chapter 2 verses 21 through 23.

01:03:08.179 --> 01:03:11.980
Was not Abraham our father declared righteous by works

01:03:11.980 --> 01:03:15.679
after he offered up Isaac his son on the altar?

01:03:15.679 --> 01:03:19.980
You see that his faith was active along with his works

01:03:19.980 --> 01:03:24.079
and his faith was perfected by his works.

01:03:24.079 --> 01:03:27.079
And the scripture was fulfilled that says

01:03:27.079 --> 01:03:30.380
Abraham put faith in Jehovah

01:03:30.380 --> 01:03:33.980
and it was counted to him as righteousness

01:03:33.980 --> 01:03:40.320
and he came to be called Jehovah's Friend.

01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:45.219
One way read and we meditate on the account of Abraham

01:03:45.219 --> 01:03:48.619
we can feel the emotions that he must have felt

01:03:48.619 --> 01:03:52.219
and being asked to offer up his son Isaac,

01:03:52.219 --> 01:03:56.019
the only son that he and Sarah had.

01:03:56.019 --> 01:03:59.820
How could Abraham make such a very difficult decision?

01:03:59.820 --> 01:04:01.219
Well long before this,

01:04:01.219 --> 01:04:02.820
Abraham had made a decision

01:04:02.820 --> 01:04:04.519
that he would obey Jehovah

01:04:04.519 --> 01:04:07.320
and serve him in everything.

01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:09.619
And that decision years before

01:04:09.619 --> 01:04:11.619
to obey Jehovah and all things

01:04:11.619 --> 01:04:14.420
helped Abraham to make all the other decisions

01:04:14.420 --> 01:04:16.719
in life clear what he should do.

01:04:16.719 --> 01:04:18.920
He did not always have to consider

01:04:18.920 --> 01:04:22.719
should I do what Jehovah asks or not?

01:04:22.719 --> 01:04:27.519
As difficult a request as it was to offer up his son

01:04:27.519 --> 01:04:29.420
Abraham did not delay

01:04:29.420 --> 01:04:36.059
and took action immediately to obey Jehovah's request.

01:04:36.059 --> 01:04:37.860
Now by your baptism today

01:04:37.860 --> 01:04:39.559
you're telling everyone

01:04:39.559 --> 01:04:44.059
that you have dedicated your life to Jehovah

01:04:44.159 --> 01:04:46.159
to serve and obey him

01:04:46.159 --> 01:04:49.159
for the rest of your life.

01:04:49.159 --> 01:04:52.460
Now let's consider three scriptures

01:04:52.460 --> 01:04:55.659
and see how you can show your faith

01:04:55.659 --> 01:04:58.260
by your actions.

01:04:58.260 --> 01:04:59.960
Once we read each scripture

01:04:59.960 --> 01:05:02.360
we'll consider each scripture is part

01:05:02.360 --> 01:05:04.260
of your dedication promise

01:05:04.260 --> 01:05:08.260
and how you can show your faith in action.

01:05:08.260 --> 01:05:14.710
Our first scripture is Hebrews chapter 10 and verse 25.

01:05:14.710 --> 01:05:21.760
Hebrews chapter 10 and verse 25.

01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:24.159
Not forsaking our meetings together

01:05:24.159 --> 01:05:26.059
as some have the custom,

01:05:26.059 --> 01:05:28.059
but encouraging one another

01:05:28.059 --> 01:05:34.239
and all the more so as you see the day drawing near.

01:05:34.239 --> 01:05:36.239
Your dedication promise

01:05:36.239 --> 01:05:40.940
I will attend all meetings, assemblies and conventions.

01:05:40.940 --> 01:05:43.940
Well how do you show that by faith in action?

01:05:43.940 --> 01:05:45.940
Well you really need a job

01:05:45.940 --> 01:05:48.039
but you say no to a job

01:05:48.039 --> 01:05:52.039
that would mean that you would regularly miss meetings.

01:05:52.039 --> 01:05:53.539
You don't have to decide

01:05:53.539 --> 01:05:55.739
should I go to meetings or not?

01:05:55.739 --> 01:05:58.039
You've already made that decision

01:05:58.039 --> 01:06:01.039
when you dedicated yourself to Jehovah.

01:06:02.239 --> 01:06:03.539
Our second scripture

01:06:03.539 --> 01:06:09.340
Romans chapter 10 and verse 10.

01:06:09.340 --> 01:06:14.989
Romans chapter 10 and verse 10.

01:06:14.989 --> 01:06:19.489
For with the heart one exercises faith for righteousness

01:06:19.489 --> 01:06:21.190
but with the mouth

01:06:21.190 --> 01:06:25.690
one makes public declaration for salvation.

01:06:25.690 --> 01:06:27.789
So your dedication promise

01:06:27.789 --> 01:06:31.489
I want everyone to know about Jehovah.

01:06:31.489 --> 01:06:33.590
Your faith in action?

01:06:33.590 --> 01:06:34.889
Well going to bed early

01:06:34.889 --> 01:06:38.590
so that you can get up for field service the next morning.

01:06:38.590 --> 01:06:41.889
Auxiliary pioneering when you can.

01:06:41.889 --> 01:06:44.289
You schedule field service first

01:06:44.289 --> 01:06:47.989
and then other activities later in the day

01:06:47.989 --> 01:06:50.389
or adapting to different forms of the ministry

01:06:50.389 --> 01:06:55.239
like telephone witnessing or letter writing.

01:06:55.239 --> 01:06:56.840
Our third scripture

01:06:56.840 --> 01:07:03.000
Mark chapter 11 and verse 24.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:12.750
Mark chapter 11 and verse 24.

01:07:12.750 --> 01:07:14.449
This is why I tell you

01:07:14.449 --> 01:07:17.449
all the things you pray and ask for

01:07:17.449 --> 01:07:20.449
have faith that you have received them

01:07:20.449 --> 01:07:23.949
and you will have them.

01:07:23.949 --> 01:07:25.550
Well your dedication promise

01:07:25.550 --> 01:07:29.650
I will constantly seek Jehovah's direction in prayer.

01:07:29.650 --> 01:07:31.849
Your faith in action

01:07:31.849 --> 01:07:35.449
when you're tempted to play a violent video game

01:07:35.449 --> 01:07:39.349
you reject that game and play something else.

01:07:39.349 --> 01:07:41.449
When faced with a serious illness

01:07:41.449 --> 01:07:43.550
you pray for calm and wisdom

01:07:43.550 --> 01:07:46.349
to make good decisions.

01:07:46.349 --> 01:07:49.150
When you feel yourself getting angry with someone

01:07:49.150 --> 01:07:53.550
you pray for self control.

01:07:53.550 --> 01:07:56.050
Now we could use many more scriptures

01:07:56.050 --> 01:07:58.250
and we could give you many more examples

01:07:58.349 --> 01:08:00.150
of how you can exercise

01:08:00.150 --> 01:08:03.349
and show your faith by your actions.

01:08:03.349 --> 01:08:04.949
The point is

01:08:04.949 --> 01:08:06.550
that you baptismal candidates

01:08:06.550 --> 01:08:08.349
have dedicated your life

01:08:08.349 --> 01:08:11.750
to Jehovah and to do his will.

01:08:11.750 --> 01:08:15.150
This one decision to dedicate your life

01:08:15.150 --> 01:08:17.850
and to live by his standards

01:08:17.850 --> 01:08:21.149
sets the spiritual and moral foundation

01:08:21.149 --> 01:08:23.149
for all the decisions you will make

01:08:23.149 --> 01:08:26.489
from this day forward.

01:08:26.489 --> 01:08:29.090
So let's review our second question

01:08:29.090 --> 01:08:32.689
what does it mean to exercise faith?

01:08:32.689 --> 01:08:39.250
We show our faith by our obedience to God.

01:08:39.250 --> 01:08:43.210
Now let's go to our third question

01:08:43.210 --> 01:08:48.199
how will Jehovah reward your faith?

01:08:48.199 --> 01:08:51.000
Jehovah loves his faithful worshipers

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:52.699
he wants the best for us

01:08:52.699 --> 01:08:56.199
and he wants us to be happy.

01:08:56.199 --> 01:08:58.699
Jehovah sees every time you do something

01:08:58.699 --> 01:09:00.199
to demonstrate your faith

01:09:00.199 --> 01:09:01.500
to show faith in action

01:09:01.500 --> 01:09:04.600
to be obedient to him.

01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:08.100
Now some feel that God or Jehovah

01:09:08.100 --> 01:09:11.199
is always watching out for the bad things they do.

01:09:11.199 --> 01:09:13.100
Maybe keeping a ledger track

01:09:13.100 --> 01:09:16.800
of all these things bad that a person does.

01:09:16.800 --> 01:09:18.399
But Jehovah is not doing that.

01:09:18.399 --> 01:09:20.100
He's actually looking for the good

01:09:20.100 --> 01:09:23.800
and rejoicing in the good that we are doing.

01:09:23.800 --> 01:09:25.199
We could kind of illustrate it

01:09:25.199 --> 01:09:26.899
the way that many of us

01:09:26.899 --> 01:09:29.100
are taking so many pictures these days.

01:09:29.100 --> 01:09:31.699
We all have phones, cameras.

01:09:31.699 --> 01:09:33.399
We're taking lots of pictures.

01:09:33.399 --> 01:09:35.399
And maybe you've noticed that at one point

01:09:35.399 --> 01:09:37.800
you take a picture of one of your friends

01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:40.100
and they have kind of a funny look on their face

01:09:40.100 --> 01:09:43.699
or they are in the middle of eating something.

01:09:43.699 --> 01:09:46.199
If you show your friend that picture

01:09:46.199 --> 01:09:47.899
what do they often say?

01:09:47.899 --> 01:09:50.100
Could you please delete that?

01:09:50.100 --> 01:09:53.199
That's not the picture they want you to show

01:09:53.199 --> 01:09:54.199
to other people.

01:09:54.199 --> 01:09:56.899
And that's not the picture you want to show of them.

01:09:56.899 --> 01:09:58.800
Now I want you to imagine for a moment

01:09:58.800 --> 01:10:04.199
that Jehovah has a digital photo album of you.

01:10:04.199 --> 01:10:08.000
Which pictures do you think he's keeping there?

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.600
The ones where we made serious mistakes?

01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:14.100
The ones where we did something dumb?

01:10:14.100 --> 01:10:17.300
No, based on your repentance

01:10:17.300 --> 01:10:18.600
and the ransom sacrifice.

01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:19.699
Those are deleted.

01:10:19.699 --> 01:10:21.699
They're gone.

01:10:21.699 --> 01:10:24.300
He has in his photo album of you

01:10:24.300 --> 01:10:26.199
the beautiful pictures,

01:10:26.199 --> 01:10:28.399
the beautiful moments that he's proud of

01:10:28.399 --> 01:10:32.399
that you showed your faith in action.

01:10:32.399 --> 01:10:36.699
Jehovah wants to reward your faith.

01:10:36.699 --> 01:10:41.399
In Hebrews chapter 11 and verse 6

01:10:41.399 --> 01:10:44.600
we can see how Jehovah feels about his servants

01:10:44.600 --> 01:10:48.300
by what he says here about rewarding them.

01:10:48.300 --> 01:10:51.800
Hebrews chapter 11 and verse 6.

01:10:51.800 --> 01:10:53.699
Moreover, without faith

01:10:53.699 --> 01:10:57.000
it is impossible to please God well

01:10:57.100 --> 01:10:59.199
for whoever approaches God

01:10:59.199 --> 01:11:01.000
must believe that he is

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.600
and that he becomes the rewarder

01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:08.510
of those earnestly seeking him.

01:11:08.510 --> 01:11:11.510
So when listing all these other examples of faith

01:11:11.510 --> 01:11:13.810
there in chapter 11 of Hebrews,

01:11:13.810 --> 01:11:16.510
the Apostle Paul pauses for a moment

01:11:16.510 --> 01:11:20.810
to remind us that Jehovah becomes the rewarder

01:11:20.810 --> 01:11:24.210
of those earnestly seeking him.

01:11:24.210 --> 01:11:27.010
Now when you take the time

01:11:27.010 --> 01:11:29.510
and effort to build a fire,

01:11:29.510 --> 01:11:32.609
what reward do you get in return?

01:11:32.609 --> 01:11:35.909
Well, you get the warmth and light of that fire.

01:11:35.909 --> 01:11:39.810
You can keep yourself and others warm by the fire.

01:11:39.810 --> 01:11:42.909
And a fire gives off a beautiful light

01:11:42.909 --> 01:11:46.409
that can be very welcome on a dark night.

01:11:46.409 --> 01:11:48.210
The sounds of a crackling fire

01:11:48.210 --> 01:11:52.689
can make us feel safe and happy.

01:11:52.689 --> 01:11:55.090
How will Jehovah reward

01:11:55.189 --> 01:11:56.689
his faithful worshippers

01:11:56.689 --> 01:11:59.189
for their fire of faith?

01:11:59.189 --> 01:12:01.090
Well, ultimately he will reward us

01:12:01.090 --> 01:12:03.489
with everlasting life.

01:12:03.489 --> 01:12:04.489
During his ministry,

01:12:04.489 --> 01:12:06.689
Jesus repeatedly promised

01:12:06.689 --> 01:12:07.989
that his faithful servants

01:12:07.989 --> 01:12:11.500
would get everlasting life.

01:12:11.500 --> 01:12:15.500
Just as Jehovah provided the rewards of a wood fire,

01:12:15.500 --> 01:12:17.500
he also provides many gifts

01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:19.300
that come when we build

01:12:19.300 --> 01:12:22.300
and feed our fire of faith.

01:12:22.300 --> 01:12:23.500
Consider some of the rewards

01:12:23.500 --> 01:12:25.699
that Jehovah gives us now.

01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:29.300
The reward of his word, the Bible,

01:12:29.300 --> 01:12:31.800
gives us the best advice for life.

01:12:31.800 --> 01:12:33.000
It lights our way

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:37.100
in a spiritually dark world.

01:12:37.100 --> 01:12:38.600
The reward of the ministry

01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:42.699
the most satisfying work that we can do.

01:12:42.699 --> 01:12:45.899
The reward of Holy Spirit,

01:12:45.899 --> 01:12:49.000
a powerful helper in times of trials.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:53.600
Remember you are never alone.

01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:56.100
And the reward of our loving group

01:12:56.100 --> 01:12:58.399
of brothers and sisters around the world,

01:12:58.399 --> 01:13:03.470
a source of great warmth and comfort.

01:13:03.470 --> 01:13:04.569
In conclusion,

01:13:04.569 --> 01:13:07.569
let's review our three questions.

01:13:07.569 --> 01:13:12.369
One, how can you feed your fire of faith?

01:13:12.369 --> 01:13:17.069
Read and meditate on God's word each day.

01:13:17.069 --> 01:13:21.369
Two, what does it mean to exercise faith?

01:13:21.369 --> 01:13:26.680
We show our faith by our obedience to God.

01:13:26.680 --> 01:13:31.979
And three, how will Jehovah reward your faith?

01:13:31.979 --> 01:13:36.020
Everlasting life.

01:13:36.020 --> 01:13:38.119
Please take note of this day.

01:13:38.119 --> 01:13:39.020
Remember it.

01:13:39.020 --> 01:13:40.819
Write it down.

01:13:40.819 --> 01:13:44.020
Each time you hear baptism talk in the future,

01:13:44.020 --> 01:13:47.520
take that opportunity to reflect on your baptism

01:13:47.520 --> 01:13:50.020
and the many blessings that you have received

01:13:50.020 --> 01:13:52.520
because of the decision that you made

01:13:52.520 --> 01:13:56.819
to dedicate your life to Jehovah.

01:13:56.819 --> 01:14:00.819
Jehovah, want you to be happy and to enjoy life.

01:14:00.819 --> 01:14:03.720
All eight and a half million plus

01:14:03.720 --> 01:14:05.119
of your brothers and sisters

01:14:05.119 --> 01:14:06.920
that are watching this program

01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:09.520
are with you and heart and mind

01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:13.250
and we want you to be happy.

01:14:13.250 --> 01:14:14.949
Keep clear in mind, though,

01:14:14.949 --> 01:14:16.850
that happiness is not something

01:14:16.850 --> 01:14:19.050
that you can buy for yourself

01:14:19.050 --> 01:14:20.949
or get for yourself

01:14:20.949 --> 01:14:24.449
or you can't get it by loving yourself.

01:14:24.449 --> 01:14:26.550
Just like the warmth and light

01:14:26.550 --> 01:14:29.550
are byproducts of a wood fire,

01:14:29.550 --> 01:14:32.649
so to happiness is a byproduct

01:14:32.649 --> 01:14:34.750
of faith and love

01:14:34.750 --> 01:14:38.050
for others and for Jehovah.

01:14:38.050 --> 01:14:40.149
We could say that happiness

01:14:40.149 --> 01:14:45.819
is the warmth and glow from love's fire.

01:14:45.819 --> 01:14:47.619
The world will tell you

01:14:47.619 --> 01:14:49.220
you can follow your dreams.

01:14:49.220 --> 01:14:52.220
You can be anything you want to be.

01:14:52.220 --> 01:14:57.220
But it is far better to let Jehovah dream for you.

01:14:57.220 --> 01:14:59.619
Your life serving Jehovah

01:14:59.619 --> 01:15:02.619
can be far greater than anything

01:15:02.619 --> 01:15:05.619
you could dream up for yourself.

01:15:05.619 --> 01:15:08.020
Please, from this day forward,

01:15:08.020 --> 01:15:11.020
be determined to keep feeding

01:15:11.020 --> 01:15:15.529
and exercising your faith.

01:15:15.529 --> 01:15:18.329
Thank you, brother Ekran.

01:15:18.329 --> 01:15:19.829
Again, this year,

01:15:19.829 --> 01:15:21.529
the circumstances for baptism

01:15:21.529 --> 01:15:24.430
will vary in each location.

01:15:24.430 --> 01:15:25.930
Be assured that your elders

01:15:25.930 --> 01:15:27.729
have made suitable provisions

01:15:27.729 --> 01:15:29.930
in accord with local circumstances

01:15:29.930 --> 01:15:32.130
for candidates to be baptized

01:15:32.130 --> 01:15:35.229
after the conclusion of this session.

01:15:35.229 --> 01:15:39.529
And now, let's sing together song number 79,

01:15:39.529 --> 01:15:42.430
teach them to stand firm.

01:15:42.430 --> 01:15:44.130
After the song,

01:15:44.130 --> 01:15:45.630
you may have the prayer offered

01:15:45.630 --> 01:15:47.430
from your own location.

01:15:47.430 --> 01:15:50.430
Again, that song number 79.
