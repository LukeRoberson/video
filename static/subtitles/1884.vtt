00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:08.070
This is our seventh video update since the start of the pandemic.

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:14.830
This one is about a very special topic, you precious young ones.

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:16.989
How are you doing?

00:00:16.989 --> 00:00:21.829
We want to commend you for being active in the ministry.

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:26.030
Not only that, but attending meetings and reading the Bible.

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:29.710
Many of you have even got baptized during the pandemic.

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.670
We're so proud of you.

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.670
But we're also concerned about you.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:46.350
We've heard that many of you are struggling with only seeing your friends on a screen and not in person.

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.109
Some of you are dealing with a lack of structure in your life.

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:55.909
And for many of you, even school is different now.

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.750
We know this must be a hard time for you.

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.590
You're not alone.

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.829
Many young ones are facing the same challenges.

00:01:06.829 --> 00:01:15.319
As you watch this video, see if you can relate to how these young ones feel.

00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:17.920
Sometimes I struggle with the negative attitude

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.120
making that coronavirus will never end.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.439
My normal routine has completely changed.

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:26.040
It's a very unusual situation.

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:32.920
At first, I was kind of just sitting around all day, being lazy, wishing I could hang out with my friends like I used to.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:39.719
I would stay up late and sleep in, and I was losing track of time.

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:44.599
Now being able to access each of my friends has been a real talent.

00:01:44.599 --> 00:01:51.000
Now that I'm spending more time with my family, and I'm much more likely to get irritated quickly.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.840
Kids my age are always anxious when their parents go to work.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.879
They keep thinking, are they going to get infected?

00:01:57.879 --> 00:02:04.040
One of my biggest concerns was that I would infect my family, especially my grandparents.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:10.379
When homeschooling started, I found it very difficult to study all on my own.

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:17.599
I felt overwhelmed and ended up not being able to do anything.

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:22.919
I struggled with telephone witnessing because I was afraid of the reaction I would get from people.

00:02:22.919 --> 00:02:27.000
Phone witnessing is a lot scarier than letter writing for me.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.960
My timing for me is actually going down.

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.199
This made me feel really sad.

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:35.719
When we were told that we could no longer attend meetings as usual,

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:40.520
it was like someone said, you may not see your family.

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:47.930
I've really missed being able to hug my brothers and sisters and friends from the congregation.

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:53.770
Did some of those comments hit home with you and your family?

00:02:53.770 --> 00:03:02.330
Why don't you pause this video and think about it or talk about it with your family?

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:13.530
For example, which of those challenges did you identify with the most?

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.729
We hope you had a good chat about the challenges you're dealing with.

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:21.930
We feel for you, Jehovah does too.

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:28.969
He knows this is tough and has promised to help us through difficult times.

00:03:28.969 --> 00:03:35.530
Let's read what he promised at Isaiah 41-10.

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:41.129
Isaiah 41-10, do not be afraid for I am with you.

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:45.930
Do not be anxious for I am your God.

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.930
I will fortify you.

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.250
Yes, I will help you.

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:58.090
I will really hold on to you with my right hand of righteousness.

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.169
Did you catch that?

00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:03.449
Jehovah has got you by the hand.

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:08.810
And he's not going to let go during this pandemic.

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:14.009
He can give you the strengths you need to control your thinking

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:19.050
and to make the best of your circumstances.

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:29.379
In this next video, listen to what's helping other young people to deal with these challenges.

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:34.500
For those having a tough time, I would encourage them to not look back at what they can't do

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.180
but look at the new opportunities they have now.

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.779
Making a plan helped me to be organized in my daily life.

00:04:41.779 --> 00:04:45.300
I made it to do list, for example, which was extremely helpful.

00:04:48.579 --> 00:04:52.259
I decided I would study not because my parents told me to,

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:54.259
but to be able to serve Jehovah.

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:56.339
That boosted my morale.

00:04:58.259 --> 00:05:03.939
If I am frustrated or bored, doing something creative helps.

00:05:03.939 --> 00:05:09.540
Having creative outlets helped me to realize that I don't need to be with my friends all the time.

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:14.740
So I started painting, sewing, learning a new language, a new instrument,

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:16.740
and cooking and baking a lot more.

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.220
Arguments with my brother, they happen.

00:05:19.939 --> 00:05:26.579
But when we deliver food or do good for others, we both feel good about it and we bond more.

00:05:26.579 --> 00:05:31.860
Talk to your parents because the more you keep something inside, the worse you're going to feel.

00:05:32.579 --> 00:05:35.540
Do not be afraid to talk about your feelings with someone else.

00:05:36.339 --> 00:05:38.819
It's not a weakness, but a sign of strength.

00:05:40.019 --> 00:05:41.939
I'm thinking about what to do.

00:05:41.939 --> 00:05:45.779
Whatever feelings you have, even if sometimes you don't understand them yourself,

00:05:46.339 --> 00:05:50.259
pour them out to Jehovah, he will always help at the right time.

00:05:52.259 --> 00:05:53.699
I talked to my parents.

00:05:53.699 --> 00:05:58.100
They gave me some practical suggestions on how I could spend more time in the ministry,

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:01.540
such as later writing and sitting in on other people's judges.

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:06.100
I was able to talk to a friend at school about Jehovah.

00:06:06.579 --> 00:06:11.939
She joined one of our Zoom meetings and even gave a comment during the watchtower study,

00:06:11.939 --> 00:06:13.540
which I was really happy about.

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:22.019
During this pandemic, a lot of things have changed on this earth, but we don't have to be afraid.

00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:34.339
We can succeed and we will be able to enjoy that beautiful life and paradise.

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:40.779
Those young ones said that might help you.

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:45.500
Which solutions do you think could work for you?

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:54.220
Go ahead and pause this video and think about it or talk about it with your family.

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:56.699
We'll give you a moment now.

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:04.759
Did you come up with any good ideas?

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:06.519
I'm sure you did.

00:07:06.839 --> 00:07:15.160
One of the keys to coping with this pandemic is doing what it says at Philippians 1-10.

00:07:16.439 --> 00:07:20.759
There we read, make sure of the more important things.

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:26.519
What are some of those more important things?

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:36.759
The basics, the Bible reading, prayer, field service, and of course family worship.

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:42.040
How about a personal study? That's important too.

00:07:43.399 --> 00:07:51.560
The young people's textbooks are a great place to find topics that may be affecting you right now.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.600
Some young ones have started reading life stories.

00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:00.120
One young sister reads a different one every day.

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:07.720
It's like traveling the globe and hearing firsthand how others have dealt with challenges.

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:14.040
You can find those articles on Watchtower Online Library.

00:08:14.759 --> 00:08:16.680
Just type in life stories.

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:20.360
Here's something else to think about.

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:27.720
What practical steps can we take when feeling alone or lonely?

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:33.720
Remember what Proverbs 181 says? Let's read it.

00:08:34.519 --> 00:08:45.080
Whoever isolates himself, that is, keeps to himself, rejects all practical wisdom.

00:08:46.279 --> 00:08:51.399
If you're feeling alone, it's practical wisdom to reach out to others.

00:08:52.279 --> 00:08:59.240
You may find that some good conversation or laughter with your friends from the congregation

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:04.840
even over the phone is just what the doctor ordered.

00:09:06.039 --> 00:09:13.960
Another way we can show practical wisdom is by learning from the good examples of other young ones.

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:21.399
You know some young people are in prison for their faith. Others are awaiting trial.

00:09:22.679 --> 00:09:28.840
What helps them to cope? You'll find out in this interview with sister Daria

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:36.120
Dilova from Russia. When she was just 18, her home was rated,

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:42.440
and the government started a criminal investigation against her and her mom.

00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:56.389
They rated our home on August 1, 2018. My feelings on the time probably both fear and shock.

00:09:56.950 --> 00:10:01.029
They told my mom that I needed to be rescued from the mire.

00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:06.789
Otherwise, I would have no future, no job, no family, nothing.

00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:12.309
They opened a criminal case against me and I was found guilty.

00:10:12.309 --> 00:10:17.590
Mom was given a two-year conditional sentence and I received one year.

00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:23.429
After a short time, they started another criminal case against me and now we scored proceedings

00:10:23.429 --> 00:10:29.480
are ongoing. I was afraid they would send my mom and me to prison.

00:10:30.279 --> 00:10:36.600
So, to somehow a lady fear, I tried to spend more time in personal study.

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:41.480
That way, even if they did imprison me, I would have more to meditate on.

00:10:42.759 --> 00:10:47.720
Second Chronicles chapter 20 verse 17 encouraged me. It says,

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:52.759
take your position, stand still and see the salvation of Jehovah in your behalf.

00:10:52.759 --> 00:10:57.159
That means not just entrusting Jehovah with your problems,

00:10:57.159 --> 00:11:00.519
but it also means waiting for him to act.

00:11:01.399 --> 00:11:04.759
At the convention that took place shortly before we were rated,

00:11:04.759 --> 00:11:09.879
it was an interesting point made about how humans are actually 80% of water.

00:11:09.879 --> 00:11:16.279
So, when they took me into the interrogation room, I sat down and looked at the interrogator.

00:11:16.279 --> 00:11:22.360
And in my mind, I drew a dotted line and filled him up 80% with water.

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:24.600
And when he started saying things like,

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:26.840
Dasha, you've got no future.

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:29.320
Always so was him feeling out with water.

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:32.600
In short, his threats didn't bother me.

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:37.399
Because I felt Jehovah's support during those trials,

00:11:37.399 --> 00:11:40.360
I'm no longer afraid to face new ones.

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:42.679
I'm sure that Jehovah will support me.

00:11:42.679 --> 00:11:45.080
He scared me not to come in a way that I expect,

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:48.840
but I know that it will always be in a way that glorifies him.

00:11:48.919 --> 00:11:52.679
And that's a guarantee that everything will be okay for me.

00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:04.860
Isn't it encouraging to see how Daria has kept her integrity and defended her faith?

00:12:06.139 --> 00:12:08.860
Well, I've enjoyed talking to you young ones,

00:12:09.659 --> 00:12:12.860
but I'd like to talk to the rest of the family for a moment,

00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:16.539
since this pandemic has brought challenges to them too.

00:12:18.379 --> 00:12:21.659
Parents, many of you have been busier than ever,

00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:28.059
supporting your children with their remote schooling while also working and maintaining

00:12:28.059 --> 00:12:32.700
your homes and keeping up with your schedule of theocratic activities.

00:12:33.659 --> 00:12:36.379
You're trying to juggle at all.

00:12:37.259 --> 00:12:39.980
We love you for it, Jehovah does too.

00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:44.299
What's going to help us all get through?

00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:48.059
This is a good spiritual routine.

00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:53.820
Parents, we commend you for keeping family worship regular.

00:12:54.779 --> 00:13:00.299
From time to time, can you include to some extended family members,

00:13:00.299 --> 00:13:04.379
our friends, by video conference, or by telephone?

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:08.139
They'll love that also, and so will you.

00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:16.299
It warms our hearts to see all that you young ones are doing to stay close to Jehovah during

00:13:16.299 --> 00:13:23.820
this time. In spite of all that's going on, you're continuing to grow spiritually.

00:13:24.539 --> 00:13:31.340
We're very proud of you, and you can be sure that Jehovah is proud of you too.

00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:39.019
We want to extend the warm love of the governing body to every one of you.

00:13:39.019 --> 00:13:49.019
From the World Headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses, this is J. W. Broadcaste.
