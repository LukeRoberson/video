00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:17.000
Through Isaiah, Jehovah promised to feed his servants, physically and spiritually.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:35.939
Today, Jehovah invites us to a banquet that is spiritually nourishing.

00:00:35.939 --> 00:00:52.969
Bible-based videos and publications draw us close to God and satisfy our hunger for truth.

00:00:52.969 --> 00:01:07.670
In the New World, abundant healthy food will be more than a promise.

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.670
It will be a reality.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:35.709
There will be an abundance of grain on the earth.

00:01:35.709 --> 00:01:38.709
On the top of the mountains, it will overflow.

00:01:38.709 --> 00:01:48.459
Do you long for a home of your own?

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:57.379
Jehovah promised the returning exiles that they would build and enjoy comfortable dwellings.

00:01:57.379 --> 00:02:15.500
Jehovah likewise cares for us whether we lose our home or we are taken from it.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:35.270
Above all, true worship provides spiritual security that is found nowhere else.

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:42.270
The spiritual home we have now reminds us that Jehovah will give us a physical place to call home.

00:02:42.270 --> 00:03:14.180
In the New World, they will build houses and live in them.

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:27.210
How would you feel during a long journey where you might meet wild animals and criminals along the road?

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:37.650
Jehovah assured the returning exiles that they would return in safety and dwell in peace.

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:53.159
In the spiritual paradise we enjoy right now, people who were once violent have learned to be humble, loving and peaceable.

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:59.209
Imagine the peace that will reign in God's New World, where we can wander this beautiful glows, explore every corner and admire the handiwork of the true God with no fear.

00:04:59.209 --> 00:05:11.259
They will do no harm nor cause any ruin in all my holy mountain says Jehovah.

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:21.779
Clear instruction from Jehovah.

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:34.250
Draws us close to him and maintains spiritual health.

00:05:34.250 --> 00:06:00.550
While false teachings hold many in the grip of spiritual darkness, Jehovah offers true freedom.

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:19.829
The spiritual health we enjoy now reminds us that perfect physical and mental health await us in paradise.

00:06:29.120 --> 00:07:02.860
Imagine waking every day, feeling clean, healthy, happy, and full of the joy of life.

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:15.350
Jehovah promises, no resident will say, I am sick.

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:19.350
Jehovah fulfilled his word to the exiles.

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:25.350
He restored that ruin nation as if bringing it back to life.

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:36.399
In 1919, Jehovah did something similar.

00:07:36.399 --> 00:07:52.019
He released his modern day people from spiritual captivity and energized them to preach.

00:07:52.019 --> 00:08:22.540
Just as Jehovah raised his people from figurative death, so will he reverse the effects of literal death?

00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:32.860
Indeed, God will swallow up death forever.

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:57.710
Imagine living longer than any tree.

00:08:57.710 --> 00:08:59.710
Death will be no more.
