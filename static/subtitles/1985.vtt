00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:12.660
And in production to second Timothy, this letter was written by the Apostle Paul in Rome about 65 CE.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:20.660
Emperor Nero had begun persecuting Christians, and Paul was again a prisoner in Rome.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.660
During his first imprisonment, he was under house arrest.

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.660
This time his situation was far more serious.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.659
He was not only in chains, but he was also facing imminent death.

00:00:34.659 --> 00:00:42.299
Paul wrote this warm letter to Timothy to encourage him to stir up like a fire,

00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:48.299
the gift of God that he received, to do his utmost to remain approved by God,

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:53.299
and to flee from the improper desires of youth.

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:57.299
Second Timothy has four chapters.

00:00:57.299 --> 00:01:04.299
Paul opens his letter with warm encouragement for Timothy, who may still be an Ephesus.

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:09.299
Paul mentions that some brothers in Asia have turned away from him,

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:16.299
but he commends on a cipherus, who courageously searched for Paul to minister to him.

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:24.299
In chapter 2, Paul tells Timothy to teach other faithful men the many things he learned from Paul.

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:33.299
The Apostle urges Timothy to reject foolish and ignorant debates, knowing that they produce fights.

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.299
Did you know?

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:42.299
Paul's second letter to Timothy is the last of 14 books that the Apostle was inspired to write,

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.299
over a period of about 15 years.

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:50.299
He wrote at least five of those books while he was in confinement in Rome.

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:59.730
The book of Hebrews being written either shortly before or shortly after his release.

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:07.730
In chapter 3, Paul foretells what people in general will be like during the last days of Satan's world.

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:12.729
Paul then reminds Timothy that the Scriptures, which are inspired of God,

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:15.729
are able to make him wise for salvation.

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:28.960
Paul also says that all those desiring to live with godly devotion and association with Christ Jesus will be persecuted.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:34.960
In chapter 4, Paul solemnly charges Timothy to preach the word urgently,

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.960
because the time is coming when some will reject the truth,

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.960
preferring to have their ears tickled with false stories.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:52.300
Paul then indicates that his death is near, so he asks Timothy to come to him quickly and to bring Mark along.

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:57.129
As you read Paul's second letter to Timothy,

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:06.129
note how Paul, despite facing imminent death, was primarily concerned about others, especially his beloved Timothy.

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:12.129
How all those desiring to live with godly devotion will be persecuted.

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:21.129
And how, like Paul and Timothy, we should fully accomplish our ministry as we keep our focus on God's kingdom.
