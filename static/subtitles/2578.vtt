00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:05.780
An introduction to the Book of Exodus.

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:12.779
Exodus was written by Moses in the wilderness of Sinai in 1512 BCE,

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:15.779
a year after the Israelites left Egypt.

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:23.780
The book covers a period of 145 years, from Joseph's death in 1657 BCE,

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:28.780
to the construction of the Tabernacle in 1512 BCE.

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:34.780
Exodus tells us how Jehovah delivered the Israelites from slavery in Egypt,

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:41.780
how he organized them into a nation, and how he taught them how to worship him.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.780
Exodus has 40 chapters.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.780
In chapter 1, we learned that the Israelites have increased at an extraordinary rate,

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.780
causing Pharaoh to subject them to harsh slavery.

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:03.780
Chapters 2 to 4 relate events around Moses' birth, his adoption by Pharaoh's daughter,

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.780
and his flight to the land of Midian after killing an Egyptian who was oppressing a Hebrew.

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.780
Many years later, Jehovah commissioned Moses to lead Israel out of Egypt.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.780
In chapter 7 through 10, Moses, using his brother Aaron as spokesman,

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:28.780
repeatedly tells Pharaoh to send Israel away, but Pharaoh refuses to do so.

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.780
Jehovah responds by bringing ten plagues on Egypt.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.780
These include turning the Nile River into blood, covering the land with frogs,

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.780
and inflicting boils on man and beast.

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.780
In chapter 12, God institutes the Passover.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:52.780
He also brings the tenth and final plague, the death of the firstborn,

00:01:52.780 --> 00:02:00.780
a humiliated Pharaoh whose son is among the dead at last tells the Israelites to leave.

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:07.780
In chapter 13, by means of a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night,

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.780
Jehovah leads his people to freedom.

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:17.780
In chapters 14 and 15, Pharaoh foolishly pursues the Israelites,

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.780
but Jehovah drowns him in the red sea along with his military force.

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.780
Moses and the Israelites then sing a victory song to Jehovah.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:33.639
Did you know Through Moses, Jehovah told Pharaoh,

00:02:33.639 --> 00:02:38.639
for this very reason I have kept you in existence to show you my power

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:42.639
and to have my name declared in all the earth.

00:02:42.639 --> 00:02:45.639
God's name did become widely known.

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:51.639
Even 40 years later, the people of Canaan, including Rehab of Jericho,

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:54.639
recalled the events at the red sea.

00:02:54.639 --> 00:03:01.639
More important, Pharaoh's humiliating ends serves notice on all who defy Jehovah,

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:05.210
including Satan.

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:09.210
In chapter 16, Jehovah provides the Israelites with mana,

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:13.210
which becomes their main food during their wilderness trek.

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:17.210
In chapter 19, Moses ascends Mount Sinai,

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:22.210
where God promises that if the Israelites strictly obey him,

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:27.210
they will become to him a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:32.210
In chapter 20, the people witness thunder and lightning,

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:37.210
the sound of a horn, and smoke coming from Mount Sinai,

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:40.210
as God gives the Ten Commandments.

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:46.210
In chapter 24, Moses reads the book of the covenant to the people.

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:51.210
They respond, all that Jehovah has spoken we are willing to do.

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:55.210
Chapters 25 to 40 deal largely with the priesthood,

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:59.210
the construction of the tabernacle, the arc of the covenant,

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:03.210
the lampstand, and other sacred items.

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:08.210
Chapters 28 and 29 focus on the attire of the priests

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:11.210
and the installation of the priesthood.

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:16.209
The high priest's attire includes an effort and a turbine with a golden plate,

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:22.209
engraved on the plate, are the words holiness belongs to Jehovah.

00:04:22.209 --> 00:04:26.209
In chapter 32, while Moses is on Mount Sinai,

00:04:26.209 --> 00:04:32.209
the people make a golden calf and worship it with dancing and singing.

00:04:32.209 --> 00:04:36.209
When Moses returns, he burns and crushes the idol,

00:04:36.209 --> 00:04:41.209
scatters the powder on the water, and makes the Israelites drink it.

00:04:41.209 --> 00:04:45.209
In chapter 34, Moses, again on Mount Sinai,

00:04:45.209 --> 00:04:50.209
hears Jehovah declare his name and attributes.

00:04:50.209 --> 00:04:56.209
Chapter 40 tells us that the pillar of cloud covers the completed tabernacle,

00:04:56.209 --> 00:04:59.209
which fills with God's glory.

00:04:59.209 --> 00:05:05.120
As you read the book of Exodus,

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:09.120
note how Jehovah can humiliate the proud and arrogant,

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.120
observe how he uses the humble and meek,

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.120
and see how his deliverance of Israel strengthens our faith

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.120
and our future deliverance by means of God's kingdom.
