00:00:01.169 --> 00:00:08.169
Our text today highlights the importance of consoling which basically conveys the idea

00:00:08.169 --> 00:00:14.490
to soothe and courage uplift fortify.

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.010
It also encourages us to support the weak and the basic meaning of that expression support

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:28.370
the weak is to hold fast to, cleave to the person that's needing assistance.

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:31.969
By doing that, we are certainly imitating Jehovah, aren't we?

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:38.969
At Psalm 34, 18, it says, Jehovah is close to the broken hearted, he's right there.

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.729
He saves those who are crushed in spirit.

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:45.969
He lifts up those who are depressed.

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:52.609
Well what can help us to imitate Jehovah to the best of our ability and consoling, supporting,

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:55.409
and doing all that with patience?

00:00:55.409 --> 00:00:59.250
Well one thing that will certainly help is the relationship between the one giving the

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.689
assistance and the one receiving it.

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:06.689
If there's friendship there, it makes a big difference.

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.730
Because the one receiving the help feels comfortable, they may have something very embarrassing

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:19.290
or sensitive to talk about, and doing so with a true trusted friend makes it a lot easier.

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.250
And the one rendering the assistance, if he's a friend, then it doesn't come across like

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:33.989
he's interrogating or he's investigating something, but rather he's showing genuine interest.

00:01:33.989 --> 00:01:39.030
Well building up an understanding of the background of each other certainly helps, doesn't it?

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.870
That's what friends do.

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:44.670
We understand a lot about that person, don't we?

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:51.989
For example, what could build up our desire to be consoling, to be supportive, and to do

00:01:51.989 --> 00:01:53.909
it with patience?

00:01:53.909 --> 00:02:00.150
With the background, here are just a few examples of background that can motivate us to do just

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.790
what our text says today.

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.390
Here they are.

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.150
Did they grow up in a dysfunctional family?

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:11.990
Was one of their parents an alcoholic?

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.990
Did the mother or father abandon them when they were young?

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:22.590
Did a beloved family member turn against the truth and is now a bitter opposer?

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.150
There could be many other reasons.

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:32.629
But such background gives us not only the desire to help with the willingness and the ability

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:37.270
to do it in a way that will be most helpful.

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:43.349
Now one thing we have to keep in mind about the variety of things that require assistance

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:48.349
is based on something that said in Romans chapter 8 and verse 22, and we invite you to

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:50.469
open your Bibles there.

00:02:50.469 --> 00:02:57.310
Romans chapter 8 and verse 22, and this will help us to appreciate that regardless of the

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.509
problem, there is a common reason for it.

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:08.830
Romans 8, 22 Paul is talking about the bad effects that have come from the Adam's sin, and

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.750
here's what he says.

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:18.110
For we know that all creation keeps on groaning together and being in pain together

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.789
until now.

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:28.069
That pain and groaning as descendants of Adam's can manifest itself in physical ailments,

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:33.110
like heart trouble, diabetes, cancer or others.

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.870
But it's not limited to physical ailment.

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:44.310
Emotional and mental issues also arise because of being descendants of Adam.

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:49.550
And so just as we had never looked down or condemned someone who had a physical ailment,

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:54.409
we would never want to do that with some time that's going through an emotional issue,

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:59.750
such as depression or another mental illness.

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:04.069
And one of the things that we want to do for those regardless of what their needs may

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:09.469
be is to use the scriptures and to be a good shepherd.

00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:15.469
Consistors can help other sisters, friends can help friends, elders of course have that

00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:18.670
responsibility to help everyone too.

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:22.750
But now there's something that we need to keep in mind when we're trying to help.

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:27.750
And it's recorded for us in Proverbs chapter 12 and verse 18.

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.110
And we invite you to turn there, Proverbs 12, 18.

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:36.470
We want to help, we want to console, we do not want to hurt.

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:38.670
Proverbs 12, 18.

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:47.470
Notless speech is like the stabs of a sword, but the tongue of the wise is a healing.

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:53.069
So our desire is to console, to support, to uplift, to cheer up, not to make them

00:04:53.069 --> 00:04:55.149
at or worse.

00:04:55.149 --> 00:04:59.470
So thoughtful speech is a key.

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:04.509
Now just illustrate how much pain can be caused if that's not done.

00:05:04.509 --> 00:05:09.829
Notice the expressions of one of our Christian sisters who went through a period of depression.

00:05:09.829 --> 00:05:12.430
She said this.

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:15.629
One lesson I'll never forget.

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:18.230
I learned empathy.

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:24.189
Before I used to think that all you had to do was to pump yourself up and get going.

00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:28.990
So I never had much fellow feeling for others who were sick.

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:30.949
Now I know.

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:34.310
And some of the friends told me to snap out of it.

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:37.750
There wasn't anything that I wanted to do more.

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:41.629
But at that point, I had no control.

00:05:41.629 --> 00:05:44.310
Their comments really hurt.

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:54.829
Well, how sad, in an effort to help, we unintentionally can inflict more pain by thoughtless speech.

00:05:54.829 --> 00:05:57.350
What can help us to prevent thoughtless speech?

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:03.230
Now we can consider these questions based on Bible principles.

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:10.350
Is what I'm about to say true, kind, necessary?

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:13.949
How would I feel if someone said that to me?

00:06:13.949 --> 00:06:16.509
Will it show respect?

00:06:16.509 --> 00:06:21.009
Is this the right setting to even bring it up at all?

00:06:21.009 --> 00:06:28.730
Thinking before we speak can do a lot to do healing rather than to inflict more pain.

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:34.370
And in this connection in helping to press ones, patience is required.

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:36.370
Perhaps you've experienced this.

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:42.329
Someone that's suppressed may pour out their feelings with great feeling and intensity.

00:06:42.329 --> 00:06:43.689
We listen.

00:06:43.689 --> 00:06:45.569
We offer encouragement.

00:06:45.569 --> 00:06:50.649
And then a short time later, they're back with the same intense feelings and concerns

00:06:50.649 --> 00:06:54.810
as if it had never been discussed before.

00:06:54.810 --> 00:07:00.290
This is required to keep consoling and to keep supporting.

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:06.170
In doing so, we would imitate Jehovah at Limitations 3, 22 and 23.

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:09.209
The Bible says about Jehovah.

00:07:09.209 --> 00:07:14.769
It is because of Jehovah's loyal love that we have not come to our finish.

00:07:14.769 --> 00:07:18.009
For his mercies never end.

00:07:18.009 --> 00:07:20.930
They are new each morning.

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:24.290
Your faithfulness is abundant.

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:28.209
Jehovah gives us help every day.

00:07:28.209 --> 00:07:34.470
And though it's not easy, we want to be just as patient and just as consoling and just

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:38.329
as helpful as Jehovah.

00:07:38.329 --> 00:07:44.410
Well after listening and offering thoughtful, scriptural advice, the scriptures are powerful,

00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:49.209
but sometimes something more than that is needed for someone who's depressed.

00:07:49.209 --> 00:07:51.250
Why do we say that?

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:59.769
Luke 531, Jesus said this, those who are healthy do not need a physician, but those who

00:07:59.769 --> 00:08:04.089
are ill do.

00:08:04.089 --> 00:08:08.329
Depression may not be because of some temporary disappointment or a temporary feeling of

00:08:08.329 --> 00:08:11.209
low or discouragement.

00:08:11.209 --> 00:08:13.649
It might be more clinical.

00:08:13.649 --> 00:08:19.649
It might have been inherited as part of a family trait or weakness.

00:08:19.649 --> 00:08:25.930
And scriptures alone, although very valuable, will not be all the help they need.

00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:32.210
In some cases, seeking medical attention is the course of wisdom and perhaps in some

00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:34.210
cases even medication.

00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:39.169
Well, if a person is in that situation, what should they do?

00:08:39.169 --> 00:08:42.129
They've been helped, but they're still needing more help.

00:08:42.129 --> 00:08:48.970
Well, with humility and modesty, recognizing their limitations, they will seek the help

00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:55.039
they need, not only spiritually, but medically.

00:08:55.039 --> 00:08:59.159
Well there's one thing about it, living in these last days, all of us are going to go periods

00:08:59.159 --> 00:09:01.919
of time where we need encouragement.

00:09:01.919 --> 00:09:10.080
In fact, we may be encouraging somebody today and next week we need it.

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:16.720
That's why the Apostle Paul and process only in chapter 5 and verse 11 said, keep encouraging

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:25.720
one another and building one another up just as in fact you are doing.

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:31.120
And if we do that, then we can help each of us endure through these last days to the

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:38.879
point where, as far told by Isaiah, no one will say I'm sick, either spiritually, mentally,

00:09:38.879 --> 00:09:41.240
emotionally or physically.

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:48.679
So in line with today's text, let us keep what we're doing, speak consolingly to those

00:09:48.679 --> 00:09:53.960
who are depressed, support the week, be patient toward all.
