00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:16.629
Whoa, I love you broke my toy I mean to I'm sorry. You always say that

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:20.190
Well, I am sorry. Well that won't fix my toy

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:22.750
What's wrong, children?

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:24.750
He broke my toy. I told him not to touch it

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.429
I said I was sorry you always say you're sorry, okay, okay children

00:00:34.119 --> 00:00:38.640
So Caleb broke your heart, but that's not all he did. He ate my ice cream

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.560
He went into my room without asking and he scribbled on my song book

00:00:43.759 --> 00:00:47.740
Well, I am sorry

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.380
Sophia, can you think of anything you have done wrong?

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:54.740
Well, I forgot to make up my bed

00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:59.380
Elast my homework and I then do the dishes

00:01:06.019 --> 00:01:09.140
Yes, it's not easy to remember our mistakes

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:17.849
But are you sorry? Do you know what Jehovah does when we are truly sorry?

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.090
He reminds us at Ephesians 432

00:01:22.769 --> 00:01:26.370
It says God freely forgave you

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.329
Sophia

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:31.329
What does it mean to freely forgive?

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:56.459
I'm sorry Sophia. It's okay Caleb. I forgive you. Oh good, children

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:59.180
That makes Jehovah very happy

00:01:59.739 --> 00:02:01.739
Anybody know where the mess came from?

00:02:02.739 --> 00:02:04.739
Uh-oh
