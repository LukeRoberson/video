00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:09.390
During the past five years, over 1.3 million faithful ones have symbolized their dedication

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:11.750
to Jehovah by water baptism.

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:19.129
That's an average of over 700 each day, and among those courageously taking their stand

00:00:19.129 --> 00:00:25.390
for true worship are thousands of children, teenagers, and young adults.

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:31.289
Young brothers and sisters, we know it is not always easy to serve Jehovah and live

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.469
up to your dedication.

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:39.310
Like older ones, you need to be encouraged and strengthened spiritually.

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:46.310
With that in mind, our theme this month is young ones, become an example to the faithful

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:47.310
ones.

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:54.070
It is based on the inspiring true life story of a young Christian named Timothy.

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:59.990
Before we discuss Timothy's example, did you know that the Bible specifically foretold

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.269
that many young people would take sides with Jehovah in our time?

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:08.909
Let's look at this at Psalm 1103.

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:16.349
And as we read it together, note how young ones are having a share in fulfilling this prophecy.

00:01:16.349 --> 00:01:21.349
Notice the first part of verse 3, David saying,

00:01:21.349 --> 00:01:27.790
your people will offer themselves willingly on the day of your military force.

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:33.909
According to this prophecy, Jesus, the Messianic King, would have a large army of willing

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:35.549
supporters.

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:41.629
Since 1914, millions have carefully investigated the facts and chosen to side with Jehovah

00:01:41.629 --> 00:01:44.109
God and Jesus Christ.

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:47.269
But where do young ones come into this picture?

00:01:47.269 --> 00:01:50.230
The rest of the verse continues.

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:57.870
In splendid holiness, from the womb of the dawn, you have your company of young men

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00.950
just like do drops.

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.390
Here the prophecy refers to a company or group of young ones.

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.750
They also would study the evidence and support God's kingdom.

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.229
How many young people did Jehovah foresee supporting true worship?

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:19.870
We get an idea by the comparison made to do drops.

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:25.310
Have you ever gone outside early in the morning and noticed a light sparkling coating of

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.469
water on the ground?

00:02:27.469 --> 00:02:29.509
That may have been do.

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:34.509
Jehovah designed our atmosphere so that under certain conditions, when the temperature

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:39.710
cools during the night, a blanket of moisture forms on the ground.

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:44.669
That coating is made up of a multitude of little drops.

00:02:44.669 --> 00:02:49.590
Young ones, what does do have to do with you?

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.550
In the Bible, do is connected with blessing and abundance.

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:59.509
Do drops are also refreshing, life-sustaining and numerous.

00:02:59.509 --> 00:03:08.310
Now remember in Psalm 1103, Jehovah was looking ahead to our time and what did he see?

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:15.030
The September 15, 2002 watched our on page 8 explained it this way.

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:22.030
Do drops like refreshing do drops, many young men and women cheerfully serve God and assist

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.430
their fellow worshipers.

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:31.669
Today there are so many mature, bright, happy young ones in the Christian congregation

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:36.949
that they are like countless do drops that sparkle in the morning sun.

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:43.310
You faithful children, teenagers and young adults who have dedicated your life to Jehovah

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:48.990
or who are working toward that goal are living proof that Jehovah's confidence in young

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:51.990
people was never misplaced.

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:57.270
He cherishes you very much and so do we.

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:03.870
Of course knowing that Jehovah has confidence in us can be very encouraging.

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:09.870
But what if doubts or negative thoughts tend to bring us down?

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:16.990
On occasion, a young witness might wonder, does anyone other than Jehovah notice me?

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:21.569
Does my example really matter to others?

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:27.750
To address these questions, let's now consider Timothy's example.

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:34.790
Open your Bible please to our theme text at 1 Timothy chapter 4 and verse 12.

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:39.850
When you find it, you might want to bookmark the verse because we want to first understand

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:41.730
the setting.

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:45.649
How old was Timothy at this time?

00:04:45.649 --> 00:04:51.930
Often when thinking of Timothy, I picture a teenager or a young man in his early 20s.

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:55.990
And when he first started traveling with Paul, he was about that age.

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:00.730
But several years passed before Paul wrote letters to Timothy.

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:07.209
So by the time first Timothy was written, Timothy was likely in his early 30s.

00:05:07.209 --> 00:05:14.089
Now what do you think was Timothy young or old?

00:05:14.089 --> 00:05:19.290
Some of you younger ones may be thinking to yourselves, if he was over 30, then he was

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:21.089
old.

00:05:21.089 --> 00:05:26.689
But remember, a much older man like Paul would say that Timothy was quite young.

00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:30.769
In fact, notice the expression he uses when writing to Timothy.

00:05:30.769 --> 00:05:34.769
First Timothy, chapter 4 and verse 12, Paul says,

00:05:34.769 --> 00:05:40.490
Never let anyone look down on your youth.

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:44.209
Instead, become an example to the faithful ones.

00:05:44.209 --> 00:05:51.410
In speaking, in conduct, in love, in faith, in chasteness.

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:56.810
Paul called Timothy a youth and urged him to be a good example.

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:02.569
While Timothy may have been in his early 30s at this time, remember that he was taught

00:06:02.569 --> 00:06:09.170
about Jehovah from the time he was a baby and he did well in the truth as a young person.

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:13.970
In fact, when he was still a teenager or in his early 20s, the elders recommended him

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:16.769
to serve as a missionary with Paul.

00:06:16.769 --> 00:06:26.170
So in effect, Paul here is urging Timothy to continue to be a good example for others.

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:29.649
What else do we know about Timothy?

00:06:29.649 --> 00:06:33.129
He was not proud or haughty.

00:06:33.129 --> 00:06:37.449
He likely did not view himself as some amazing example.

00:06:37.449 --> 00:06:43.410
I'm sure he never dreamed that one day Christians all over the world would study his life in

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:47.490
detail so as to imitate his faith.

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:54.810
Timothy was modest and this, despite his privileges, Paul's words may indicate that Timothy

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:57.129
was somewhat shy.

00:06:57.129 --> 00:07:03.050
Like many of us, he may have battled with feelings of self-doubt on occasion.

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:07.250
Based on this information, let's do something interesting now.

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:14.209
Let's use our imagination to visualize Timothy, an elder in his early 30s, coming to give

00:07:14.209 --> 00:07:16.970
a scriptural talk in the congregation.

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:18.370
Got the picture?

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:23.810
In your mind, please look at Timothy and then look at the audience.

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:26.610
Who do we see?

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:32.529
Many in attendance are old enough to be Timothy's parents or grandparents.

00:07:32.529 --> 00:07:34.730
How do you think Timothy felt?

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:36.730
Super confident?

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:42.329
Are you visualizing him proudly walking into the meeting place saying, I sure wish my

00:07:42.329 --> 00:07:49.290
friends back in Listera could see me now look at the crowds that come to hear me speak?

00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:54.009
No, that's not the Timothy we know.

00:07:54.009 --> 00:07:59.850
It's much more likely that Timothy, like most of us, rehearsed his presentation over and

00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:01.529
over again.

00:08:01.529 --> 00:08:08.769
He probably prayed constantly and he probably still got nervous like all of us.

00:08:08.769 --> 00:08:15.490
And remember, Timothy did not have the benefit of theocratic schools like we do today.

00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:20.529
In summary, what can we say about Timothy?

00:08:20.529 --> 00:08:26.529
Like so many of you, he was an example of faith and obedience.

00:08:26.529 --> 00:08:32.929
He was exceptional in displaying Christian qualities such as modesty and humility.

00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:38.169
But Timothy was a person with normal human feelings like all of us.

00:08:38.169 --> 00:08:42.610
Though he had a rich, happy life in Jehovah's service, life in the old world brought

00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:45.289
real tests and challenges.

00:08:45.289 --> 00:08:52.049
Timothy also dealt with frequent cases of sickness and he was imprisoned for a time.

00:08:52.049 --> 00:08:58.090
Some of you in various countries can relate to those bitter experiences.

00:08:58.090 --> 00:09:00.929
But Timothy endured.

00:09:00.929 --> 00:09:05.289
Was he some super Christian with super powers?

00:09:05.289 --> 00:09:06.490
No.

00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:10.970
But he did prove to be a super example.

00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:13.169
How does all of this help you?

00:09:13.169 --> 00:09:32.490
A few of you may be thinking, I wish someone would tell my parents or my elders not to look

00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:34.330
down on me.

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:37.610
They still treat me like a little kid.

00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:41.090
If that's the case, we feel for you.

00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:46.210
No progressive young one wants to be treated as if he were a child.

00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:50.570
But let's look again at 1 Timothy chapter 4 and verse 12.

00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:57.850
Is the Apostle Paul speaking to the congregation, to parents or to the elders?

00:09:57.850 --> 00:10:03.409
Never let anyone look down on your youth.

00:10:03.409 --> 00:10:10.450
Instead, become an example to the faithful ones in speaking, in conduct, in love, in faith,

00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:12.649
in chasteness.

00:10:12.649 --> 00:10:15.129
It's clear, isn't it?

00:10:15.129 --> 00:10:17.850
Paul said your youth.

00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:21.169
He was speaking only to Timothy.

00:10:21.169 --> 00:10:26.490
Young ones, by extension, what is Jehovah saying to each of you?

00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:27.850
It's this.

00:10:27.850 --> 00:10:34.889
To gain and maintain the respect of faithful ones, you have to work at proving yourself as

00:10:34.889 --> 00:10:36.570
a Christian.

00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:40.490
The key is not wanting or hoping that others will respect you.

00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:46.330
Rather, it's earning such respect by setting a good example in all areas of life.

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:52.409
If you do that, then no one will have any legitimate reason to look down on your youth.

00:10:52.409 --> 00:10:58.809
Doesn't it make sense that we gain respect by earning it?

00:10:58.809 --> 00:11:03.370
We are confident that you young ones are trying hard to live by Christian principles at

00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:05.730
school and in the neighborhood.

00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:11.370
And in verse 12, did you notice who Timothy was to be an example to?

00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:13.850
To the faithful ones.

00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:19.090
Are you an example to Christians, both younger and older, in your congregation and in your

00:11:19.090 --> 00:11:20.590
circuit?

00:11:20.590 --> 00:11:26.090
If you work on Kingdom Hall construction projects or a Bethel, are you an example to your

00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:27.570
fellow workers?

00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:30.809
Well, what are some specific ways?

00:11:30.809 --> 00:11:35.970
You can become an example to all of these faithful ones.

00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:42.409
In our theme text, Timothy was first directed to become an example in speaking.

00:11:42.409 --> 00:11:47.970
On this topic, I'll never forget an illustration used in the young people ask article from

00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:51.529
the January 2012 awake.

00:11:51.529 --> 00:11:57.970
Equated a young man, James, who said, once you squeeze toothpaste out, you can't put

00:11:57.970 --> 00:11:59.649
it back in the tube.

00:11:59.649 --> 00:12:01.529
The same is true with our words.

00:12:01.529 --> 00:12:06.370
Once we say something hurtful, we can't take it back.

00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:09.250
God's word agrees with James.

00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:14.970
Note what it says at Ephesians chapter 4 and verse 29.

00:12:14.970 --> 00:12:22.450
It tells us, let a rotten word not come out of your mouth, but only what is good for building

00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:28.730
up as the need may be to impart what is beneficial to the hearer.

00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:32.970
For some years now, those getting baptized have been encouraged to complete a study of

00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:36.409
the book, keep yourselves in God's love.

00:12:36.409 --> 00:12:41.809
Chapter 12 is entitled, Speak what is good for building up.

00:12:41.809 --> 00:12:48.649
On page 140, there's a box with five questions that can help us evaluate our speech.

00:12:48.649 --> 00:12:54.809
For example, when was the last time I offered someone specific commendation?

00:12:54.809 --> 00:13:00.090
Do I express my respect for others by saying, please, and thank you.

00:13:00.090 --> 00:13:05.889
In conversation, do I speak mainly about myself or am I also interested in the thoughts and

00:13:05.889 --> 00:13:08.730
feelings of others?

00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:14.370
Young ones, over the next few days, why not review that box on page 140?

00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:19.529
Look up the scriptures and think about what Jehovah is saying.

00:13:19.529 --> 00:13:23.009
Then apply what you learn to your speech.

00:13:23.009 --> 00:13:29.529
Doing this will draw you closer to Jehovah and help you to become an even better example

00:13:29.529 --> 00:13:32.610
to the faithful ones.

00:13:32.610 --> 00:13:38.570
The second area mentioned in our theme text is becoming an example in conduct.

00:13:38.570 --> 00:13:46.649
Of course, upbuilding speech would be empty or hypocritical if our conduct was questionable.

00:13:46.649 --> 00:13:48.730
Think again about Timothy.

00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:53.570
It wasn't enough for him to give comments and talks at the meetings or preach from

00:13:53.570 --> 00:13:55.250
door to door.

00:13:55.250 --> 00:13:59.610
Later, in the same letter, Paul reminded Timothy that he needed to treat older men and

00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:02.330
women as fathers and mothers.

00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:07.330
Younger men and women were to be treated as brothers and sisters.

00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:14.690
Second Peter, chapter 3 and verse 11, provides a similar urge and reminder about our conduct.

00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:16.210
Let's read that together.

00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:20.850
Again, that's second Peter, chapter 3 and verse 11.

00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:27.330
There it tells us, since all these things are to be dissolved in this way, consider

00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:33.490
what sort of people you ought to be in holy acts of conduct.

00:14:33.490 --> 00:14:35.370
Let's think about that.

00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:41.850
For a person's conduct to be holy from Jehovah's perspective, he or she must be morally

00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:43.370
clean.

00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:49.090
While physical cleanness is on the outside, moral cleanness is on the inside in our thoughts

00:14:49.090 --> 00:14:51.210
and desires.

00:14:51.210 --> 00:14:54.570
Is being morally clean really important?

00:14:54.570 --> 00:14:56.490
Think about it this way.

00:14:56.490 --> 00:15:01.809
When eating a meal, would you be content to eat from a bowl that had been washed only

00:15:01.809 --> 00:15:03.570
on the outside?

00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:05.129
Of course not.

00:15:05.129 --> 00:15:10.809
We want to eat from clean dishes, dishes that are thoroughly clean inside and out.

00:15:10.809 --> 00:15:15.889
So when we wash dishes, we wash the outside and the inside.

00:15:15.889 --> 00:15:21.929
Similarly, Jehovah expects his servants to be clean through and through.

00:15:21.929 --> 00:15:27.889
And because Jehovah, the perfect reader of hearts will soon dissolve, yes, eliminate

00:15:27.889 --> 00:15:33.049
this dirty system of things, it's urgent that we do so.

00:15:33.049 --> 00:15:39.289
This means that we have to work very hard so that nothing unclean enters our mind.

00:15:39.289 --> 00:15:45.169
That means firmly rejecting so-called fun and exciting entertainment, which features

00:15:45.169 --> 00:15:48.649
sex, violence or spiritism.

00:15:48.649 --> 00:15:54.190
At 1 Corinthians 14 and verse 20, the Bible tells us that we should become like young

00:15:54.190 --> 00:15:57.570
children as to badness.

00:15:57.570 --> 00:16:03.850
No matter our age, we don't need and we don't want any experience with the wickedness

00:16:03.850 --> 00:16:05.570
of this world.

00:16:05.570 --> 00:16:12.409
Rather, we keep the inside of the dish, our mind and heart clean at all times.

00:16:12.409 --> 00:16:19.210
And when we do so, our exemplary conduct pleases Jehovah and its strengthens our faithful brothers

00:16:19.210 --> 00:16:20.529
and sisters.

00:16:20.529 --> 00:16:27.049
Really, it's the only way to respect ourselves and to gain the respect of others.

00:16:27.049 --> 00:16:32.250
Our theme text at 1 Timothy chapter 4 and verse 12 goes on to mention other areas where

00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:38.809
we can make steady progress in becoming an example, such as in love, in faith and in

00:16:38.809 --> 00:16:40.809
chasteness.

00:16:40.809 --> 00:16:46.370
During your personal study, that is, your personal time with your best friend Jehovah,

00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:49.850
why not examine these areas in more detail?

00:16:49.850 --> 00:16:58.289
The treasures you gain from such a study project can last a lifetime and everlasting lifetime.

00:16:58.289 --> 00:17:00.889
So what have we learned?

00:17:00.889 --> 00:17:06.769
In fulfillment of Bible prophecy, a large company of young people from around the world

00:17:06.769 --> 00:17:10.849
are taking a stand with Jehovah and Jesus.

00:17:10.849 --> 00:17:13.970
That includes all of you.

00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:20.529
Like do drops, you're not only abundant in number, but you sparkle in our congregations.

00:17:20.529 --> 00:17:23.490
Your presence is very refreshing.

00:17:23.490 --> 00:17:28.410
So please, don't look down on your youth.

00:17:28.410 --> 00:17:30.849
Rather, rejoice in your youth.

00:17:30.849 --> 00:17:34.369
Yes, become an example to the faithful ones.
