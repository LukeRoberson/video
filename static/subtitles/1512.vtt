The Kidron Valley separates Jerusalem from the Mount of Olives, and generally runs north to south along the eastern side of the city.

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:23.109
Seen here are one, the Kidron Valley, and two, the Temple Mount.

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:28.109
The valley starts, some distance to the north of Jerusalem's walls.

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:34.109
At first it is broad and shallow, but then it begins to narrow and deepen.

00:00:34.609 --> 00:00:47.109
At the point the valley reaches the southern end of the former temple area, it is approximately 30 meters or 100 feet deep, and 120 meters or 390 feet wide.

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:50.609
However, it apparently was deeper in Jesus' day.

00:00:50.609 --> 00:01:11.709
Seen here are one, the Kidron Valley, two, the Temple Mount, and three, the Mount of Olives.

00:01:11.709 --> 00:01:19.709
It was the same valley that Jesus traversed on his way to the Garden of Gethsemane on Nysan 1433 CE.
