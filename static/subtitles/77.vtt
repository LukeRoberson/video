00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:11.119
Welcome. Usually our December program features the Gilead graduation program held in September

00:00:11.119 --> 00:00:19.760
of each year. However, the 149th class of Gilead was scheduled to arrive in the United States

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:29.679
when the COVID-19 pandemic was underway. Therefore, that class was postponed. So this month

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:37.039
will focus on being the best Bible teachers we can be. Here are a few highlights.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:45.520
Cecilia and Shira made many sacrifices to help their students become dedicated worshipers of

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:55.679
Jehovah. We'll see the impact they had on Mercedes and Abel. The arrival of a baby brings great

00:00:55.679 --> 00:01:03.280
joy as well as new challenges. We'll learn how Jehovah helps first-time parents

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:11.599
adjust to their new responsibilities. And we'll learn how Louise Blanton's parents prepared her

00:01:11.599 --> 00:01:21.280
for a satisfying life in Jehovah's service. This is JW Broadcasting for December 2020.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:49.180
My comments this month are drawn from First Corinthians 310. Let each one keep watching how

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:56.459
he is building. Building? Are we talking about the upcoming construction of a facility for

00:01:56.459 --> 00:02:03.180
headquarters departments in Ramapo, New York? Or are we referring to the building of new kingdom

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:11.900
halls in your country? Well, as important as those building projects are, my comments are

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:20.460
directed to an even more important building work. Let's look at the context in First Corinthians

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:30.900
chapter 3 and verse 5. Apollo and Paul are mentioned by name. And what was their specific role

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:41.219
identified to be? Verse 5 says, ministers through whom you became believers. Apollo and Paul had

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:48.180
taught the scriptures to many in Corinth. In verses 6 through 9, Paul likens this teaching

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:54.659
activity to the planting of a field. Seeds of truth are planted in the heart of a person.

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:03.939
By means of return visits and Bible studies, the seeds are watered. But if the person is receptive,

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:11.699
then with Jehovah's spirit and blessing, the truth will blossom and grow to the point of

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:22.819
dedication and baptism. Did you notice in verse 9, Bible teachers are described as God's fellow

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:31.460
workers? What an awesome privilege we have to assist Jehovah in gathering the precious things

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:40.500
of all the nations. So we now know the topic of these verses in First Corinthians chapter 3.

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:46.180
It's discussing Bible teachers who help others to become believers.

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:56.259
But did you also notice that in verse 9, Paul changes illustrations. He said, you are God's

00:03:56.259 --> 00:04:05.060
field under cultivation. That's agricultural. But then he changes the analogy, saying God's

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:14.340
building. That's architectural. That's construction. Why the change in illustrations?

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:24.019
The building analogy highlights a specific point. You see the illustration of the farmer doesn't

00:04:24.019 --> 00:04:31.300
focus on the farmer's impact on the growth of a plant. In that illustration, the farmer waters

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:40.899
the seedling, but it's God that makes the plant grow. However, the illustration of building or

00:04:40.899 --> 00:04:49.540
construction focuses on the builders' involvement or the Bible teachers' involvement. The one

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:55.699
constructing a building has considerable influence over the quality of the end product.

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:04.899
What kind of materials does he select? Is he thorough in his work? Or does he cut corners to get

00:05:04.899 --> 00:05:13.540
the job done faster or with less effort? Now let's read the 10th verse of First Corinthians

00:05:14.579 --> 00:05:21.649
chapter 3. According to the undeserved kindness of God that was given to me,

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:28.529
I laid a foundation as a skilled master builder, but someone else is building on it.

00:05:29.329 --> 00:05:33.490
But let each one keep watching how he is building on it.

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:41.889
There in Corinth, Paul as a master builder had initially acquainted many with the truth.

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:50.610
In effect, he laid a foundation for others to build on. But what was that foundation?

00:05:52.050 --> 00:06:01.329
Verse 11 says, for no one can lay any other foundation than what is laid, which is Jesus Christ.

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:09.009
Paul had helped establish the congregation there in Corinth based on the teachings of Jesus,

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:17.569
the foundation of the truth. Building on that foundation, others would become Bible teachers

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:25.810
and help still others to progress toward baptism. That is why Paul cautioned in verse 10 to keep

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:35.810
watching how we build. We can affect the outcome. So to all of us Bible teachers, including

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:46.500
parents, we ask the question, how are we building on the foundation? Why does it really matter?

00:06:46.899 --> 00:06:58.180
Let's read verses 12 and 13. Now if anyone builds on the foundation, gold, silver, precious stones,

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:05.860
wood, hay or straw, each one's work will be shown for what it is. For the day will show it up,

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:14.259
because it will be revealed by means of fire and the fire itself will prove what sort of work each

00:07:14.259 --> 00:07:21.860
one has built. Do we understand how important it is to analyze our teaching techniques?

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:29.860
Will we use the best techniques possible to reach our student or our child's heart?

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:37.379
Or do we just try to get by with the bare essentials? In effect, a half-hearted effort

00:07:38.339 --> 00:07:48.899
using hay or straw as it were. Some years ago, in one developing country during an economic boom,

00:07:48.899 --> 00:07:58.420
it became a priority to build more and more schools. Unfortunately, building requirements and materials

00:07:59.139 --> 00:08:07.860
were substandard. Well, what happened when a 7.9-magnitude earthquake hit one of the areas?

00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:16.660
Many schools in the earthquake zone crumbled while buildings around them remained standing.

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:26.420
An official report indicated that over 5,000 students died. Think about it.

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:33.059
Prior to the earthquake, schools were in session and everything seemed fine.

00:08:34.259 --> 00:08:38.580
Students and faculty were coming and going on a daily basis.

00:08:40.019 --> 00:08:46.899
But the unforeseen earthquake proved that the building methods used were not of the quality

00:08:47.539 --> 00:08:57.059
needed to prevent collapse and terrible carnage. First Corinthians 313 makes clear.

00:08:58.179 --> 00:09:06.740
That how we build spiritually when teaching Bible students or our children is just as important.

00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:21.539
Now, notice the sobering point made in verses 14 and 15. If anyone's work that he has built on it

00:09:21.539 --> 00:09:29.539
remains, he will receive a reward. If anyone's work is burned up, he will suffer loss.

00:09:30.659 --> 00:09:36.659
But he himself will be saved. Yet, if so, it will be as through fire.

00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:44.980
The point in verse 14 is that if we're conscientious and reach the heart of our Bible students

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:51.379
that may be what gives them the needed fortitude to withstand an unexpected trial.

00:09:52.500 --> 00:10:00.659
In that case, our diligent work remains. Then verse 15 makes the point that if our teaching

00:10:00.659 --> 00:10:05.539
techniques were inconsistent or were in some way slip-shod,

00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:13.620
our student may not successfully weather a fire or stormy trial in his life.

00:10:15.059 --> 00:10:20.659
We personally may survive, but we might suffer the loss of the one we studied with,

00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:31.070
whether a Bible student or our own child. That's why Paul is highlighting the need to be the best

00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:41.950
Bible teacher we personally can be. However, we should mention that if a person who progresses to

00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:50.830
dedication and baptism later leaves the truth, it's not necessarily the responsibility of the Bible

00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:58.990
teacher. The teacher may have been very diligent and use the best of spiritual building materials.

00:11:00.669 --> 00:11:07.870
But the student or child may not have responded from his heart, or possibly he allowed

00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:13.070
human imperfection or temptation to cause him to deviate from the way.

00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:23.470
But the takeaway point from 1 Corinthians chapter 3 is to do our best to build in our students or

00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:32.509
children fire resistant materials. We want them to remain, to endure the tests that are sure to

00:11:32.509 --> 00:11:40.509
come their way. What might be likened to building with inferior materials when studying the

00:11:40.509 --> 00:11:48.110
Bible with someone? Possibly, we initially arouse a person's interest by telling about the

00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:56.029
hope of everlasting life and paradise. That's indeed scriptural. But is that in itself building in

00:11:56.029 --> 00:12:05.009
such a way that the person will survive a fiery trial of faith in the future? What if our

00:12:05.009 --> 00:12:12.049
teaching consisted solely of saying, if you want to live forever in paradise, you must study,

00:12:12.769 --> 00:12:22.610
go to the meetings, and share in the preaching work? If so, we are not building in a way to ensure

00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:32.129
that the student or child will resist the fire of trials or stand the test of time. In effect,

00:12:33.009 --> 00:12:42.289
we're using wood, hay, or straw. Do you remember that Paul said we are to build on the foundation?

00:12:43.889 --> 00:12:52.049
He said the foundation is Jesus Christ. That is solid. Ephesians chapter 3,

00:12:53.409 --> 00:13:02.450
16 and 17, helps us to understand what it means to build with quality materials such as gold,

00:13:02.450 --> 00:13:11.730
silver, and precious stones. In verse 16, it makes clear that there's a way that we can be made

00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:22.450
mighty in the person we are inside. Let's read verse 17, and that through your faith you may have

00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:30.289
the Christ dwell in your hearts with love. May you be rooted and established on the foundation.

00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:37.330
How can we help our child or Bible student become strong or mighty spiritually?

00:13:38.769 --> 00:13:44.929
Interestingly, verse 17 said that it's by having the Christ dwell in your hearts.

00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:54.129
Not just knowing Jesus in the head, but sounding his teachings and personality down into our

00:13:54.129 --> 00:14:04.850
student's heart. It means to know Jesus so well that it's as if he lives or dwells inside of us

00:14:04.850 --> 00:14:14.450
and motivates us as Christians. The result, verse 17 concluded by saying that the student would

00:14:14.450 --> 00:14:23.169
become rooted and established on the foundation. Yes, solidly grounded on Jesus Christ.

00:14:24.850 --> 00:14:32.529
And Hebrews 1.3 says that Jesus is the reflection of God's glory and the exact representation

00:14:32.529 --> 00:14:40.690
of His very being. Jesus Himself said, no one comes to the Father except through me.

00:14:41.649 --> 00:14:48.049
So building with fire-resistant materials means helping the student to love Jesus, yes,

00:14:48.929 --> 00:14:58.500
but also having a close, loving relationship with Jehovah God Himself. But why are we considering the theme

00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:10.299
keep watching how you are building now? Why is this more urgent than ever before? It's because

00:15:11.179 --> 00:15:18.299
all indications scripturally and circumstantially point to Satan's evil system of things

00:15:18.299 --> 00:15:27.179
coming to an abrupt end. The physical indications of Matthew chapter 24 and the bizarre

00:15:27.179 --> 00:15:36.220
temperament described in 2 Timothy 3, 1 through 5 become more and more precise as we watch the

00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:46.690
scene of this world unfold. We can expect even more opposition and persecution from those who

00:15:46.690 --> 00:15:54.690
are opposed to our resolve to stand on the side of Jehovah. Our brothers in Russia and other lands

00:15:54.690 --> 00:16:04.049
are experiencing this now. Some have been beaten and brutalized in other ways. As we've heard,

00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:13.169
others have been sentenced to years in prison. In recent years, the organization has reminded us

00:16:13.169 --> 00:16:21.330
of what we can expect as the great tribulation begins. Do you remember this video clip

00:16:21.970 --> 00:16:28.929
from the pursue what builds loyalty video series shown at the 2016 Regional Convention?

00:16:29.649 --> 00:16:31.330
Be Remind

00:16:32.929 --> 00:16:44.929
And your faith has led you here as loyal servants of Jehovah, confident that Psalm 97 verse 10

00:16:44.929 --> 00:16:51.649
applies to you personally. Jehovah is guarding the lives of his loyal ones.

00:17:07.039 --> 00:17:58.990
Chuck the basement. Chuck that. That video series has been affectionately called

00:17:59.950 --> 00:18:07.230
the basement video. It was depicting one possible scenario that could be considered a fire

00:18:08.109 --> 00:18:15.069
according to 1 Corinthians 313. The serious question we want to ask ourselves is,

00:18:16.029 --> 00:18:22.990
would my Bible student or child be in the basement with those other faithful brothers and sisters?

00:18:24.509 --> 00:18:33.470
If not, would the reason be because of his own lack of faith or might it at least in part

00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:39.789
be because we did not take our responsibility as a teacher seriously enough?

00:18:39.950 --> 00:18:48.670
Did we build with fire resistant materials or in effect with hay or straw?

00:18:50.779 --> 00:18:59.500
The same verse said, for the day, we'll show it up. The fire itself will prove what sort of work

00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:09.740
each one has built. It's a sobering thought, isn't it? If you recall in the May 2020 JW Broadcasting

00:19:09.819 --> 00:19:16.619
Monthly program, Bertha let addressed the concern a few parents have expressed about some of our

00:19:16.619 --> 00:19:24.940
videos that depict biblical or modern day situations. In these times, true worshipers are depicted as

00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:34.140
having their faith tested as if by fire. The concern expressed as it, some scenes could have an

00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:41.740
effect on children who've been protected from all negative circumstances on TV, including daily

00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:51.259
news reports of catastrophes being faced by real people. The basement scene we just reviewed was

00:19:51.259 --> 00:19:58.940
one of our videos that produced such a reaction. Another one was the reenactment of the Bible

00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:06.859
Account depicting Jehovah's Saving Acts in the time of King Hezekiah. It was shown at the 2016

00:20:06.859 --> 00:20:15.579
Regional Convention and the video was entitled, Oh Jehovah, I Trust in You. Let's look again at

00:20:15.579 --> 00:20:48.799
that portrayal of Jehovah's Saving Acts. If a parent has shielded his child from viewing

00:20:48.799 --> 00:20:56.720
all scenes on the news or other visual images depicting negative realities, it's understandable

00:20:57.359 --> 00:21:06.640
that there may be a concern. However, as Bertha let's state it, parents need to give their children

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:15.920
a realistic idea of what we will face in the near future. Many parents choose to help their

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:22.880
children appreciate the graphic visual imagery of a Bible-based account while at the same time

00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:30.720
building trust in Jehovah who will be with them in times of distress. The point is, friends,

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:37.359
the Bible warns us young and old alike that a time of fiery testing looms on the horizon,

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:46.880
we want to be realistic and face these events with faith and courage. Our videos depict such

00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:55.839
circumstances in a tasteful and sanitized way, not showing any actual acts of bloodshed or violence.

00:21:58.210 --> 00:22:05.490
Be assured that the governing body is not trying to scare anyone. Instead,

00:22:06.210 --> 00:22:14.690
we are trying to prepare everyone. We feel responsible to fortify the brotherhood by using

00:22:14.690 --> 00:22:19.970
fire-resistant building materials in the Spirit of 1 Corinthians 3.

00:22:21.410 --> 00:22:27.809
As teachers of the Word of God, may we all give prayerful thought to the methods,

00:22:28.609 --> 00:22:34.130
techniques, and the diligence we display when conducting Bible studies.

00:22:35.569 --> 00:22:43.539
We're motivated by the very spirit of Jehovah God, the words at 2 Peter 3 9 come to mind.

00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:53.940
After Jehovah it says, he does not desire anyone to be destroyed, but desires all to attain

00:22:54.660 --> 00:23:02.579
to repentance. May that be our resolve. As we take to heart the inspired words of 1 Corinthians 3

00:23:02.579 --> 00:23:12.460
10, let each one keep watching how he is building. Having children is one of the greatest

00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:19.019
joys in life and one of the greatest responsibilities Jehovah entrust to a husband and wife.

00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:26.619
In the following dramatization, notice how the arrival of a baby changes a marriage

00:23:26.619 --> 00:23:38.289
and how Jehovah helps first-time parents. Jehovah has been so good to us.

00:23:39.250 --> 00:24:00.779
We enjoy a busy life full of blessings, including one we didn't expect.

00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:26.130
We love our little Emma so much, but child rearing was harder than we thought.

00:24:49.410 --> 00:25:07.789
Most days went well, others not so much. I just need some rest.

00:25:08.509 --> 00:25:14.910
When will things be back to normal? I wake with every little cry.

00:25:14.910 --> 00:25:24.619
I wake when she's silent. Am I doing this right? I should check on them.

00:25:24.619 --> 00:25:34.980
Anytime to ourselves was time to do nothing, fatigue was affecting our relationship with Jehovah.

00:25:35.059 --> 00:25:58.769
And each other. We were so relieved when David, a father himself, offered to visit with another

00:25:58.769 --> 00:26:12.190
elder. We read Isaiah 4029, he gives power to the tired one and full might to those lacking strength.

00:26:15.069 --> 00:26:22.109
As a loving father, Jehovah wants parents to succeed, so he gives us what we need to

00:26:22.109 --> 00:26:28.349
recharge us. Things might never be like they were before, but his suggestions helped us create

00:26:28.349 --> 00:26:35.549
a practical and consistent spiritual routine. David said it's normal for new parents to feel

00:26:35.549 --> 00:26:45.069
anxious and anxiety is tiring, so we pray for a calm heart. An extra kindness went tired,

00:26:46.029 --> 00:27:09.259
so we can keep working as a teen. I so appreciate Zach's help. And I'm sacrificing some unnecessary

00:27:09.259 --> 00:27:32.640
things to put spiritual things first. There will always be a lot to do, but when Emma sleeps,

00:27:34.849 --> 00:28:19.539
I feed my faith and rest. New spiritual routine is invigorating. Jehovah helped us to understand

00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:26.819
while life in the system may have many challenges, putting spiritual things first will give us

00:28:26.819 --> 00:28:37.869
the strength to meet them. That new father wanted life to get back to normal,

00:28:38.990 --> 00:28:48.109
but all parents realize that having children creates a new normal. If you are first time parents,

00:28:48.910 --> 00:28:56.349
please remember, one of the most important adjustments you'll make is to establish a new

00:28:56.349 --> 00:29:07.059
spiritual routine for yourselves and your precious little child. Of course, children grow and when

00:29:07.059 --> 00:29:14.259
they cross into their teenage years, suddenly everything seems to change. In the following video,

00:29:14.339 --> 00:29:21.619
notice how Rudy and the Nita Garcia were determined to teach their daughters Jehovah's ways and the

00:29:21.619 --> 00:29:29.859
results they experienced. We already had our first born, Renita, and then I was told that we were

00:29:29.859 --> 00:29:35.859
going to have twins. We were new in the truth and inexperienced, so I was saying to myself,

00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:41.539
how could I take care of my children? Not only physically, but more so spiritually,

00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:46.819
I would be able to teach them to love Jehovah, to worship Jehovah.

00:29:48.019 --> 00:29:57.619
And first Corinthians 310 shows us the importance of raising a family by using good quality materials.

00:29:58.339 --> 00:30:04.980
So having a spiritual routine is very important for the children. My wife and I would have to

00:30:04.980 --> 00:30:10.740
lay a good spiritual foundation. We would have to set a good example for our children.

00:30:11.619 --> 00:30:17.779
As long as I could remember, I would always see my parents studying doing personal Bible study.

00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:24.420
I remember dead one time he came to us in the living room and he said, you know, I was reading

00:30:24.420 --> 00:30:30.819
Psalm 1 verse 2 where it said, we should find delight in the love of Jehovah and read in an undertone

00:30:30.819 --> 00:30:37.859
day and night. He said, what if we do this as a family project like we read the Bible every day

00:30:38.019 --> 00:30:44.740
out loud together? And my parents were very simple, you know, they didn't really require a lot of

00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:53.539
fancy things. They were content. Mom and dad always worked part-time, dad pioneered, so money

00:30:53.539 --> 00:30:59.380
was limited. Sometimes the car we had wasn't the most reliable and it would break down right before

00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:05.380
the meeting. I remember when our car broke down. Initially I thought, oh, we're not going to go

00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:10.579
to the meeting. Mom and dad would say, well, the car broke down. There's a meeting tonight,

00:31:10.579 --> 00:31:17.539
so let's walk. So there's the five of us. My dad and his suit, the four women will be with our

00:31:17.539 --> 00:31:25.700
dresses, our book bags. And so that taught me not to let obstacles, anxieties prevent me from going

00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:32.259
to my meetings. Spending quality time was very important to my parents and especially after the

00:31:32.259 --> 00:31:38.900
meetings, we would change into our pajamas, grab a snack, go to the living room and just start

00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:50.529
talking about how our day went, how the meeting went. Just those special moments, it brought us

00:31:50.529 --> 00:31:58.930
closer together. I saw that dad, no matter how busy he was, he would drop what he was doing

00:31:58.930 --> 00:32:04.769
and look at me and talk. I knew I was more important to him than what he was doing.

00:32:05.730 --> 00:32:12.849
I remember a time when I had a crush on a boy. My parents reasoned with me. I felt very comfortable,

00:32:12.849 --> 00:32:18.289
you know, after that point to maybe talk about other things because I could see that my parents

00:32:19.089 --> 00:32:24.049
were not going to be angry at me, you know, they're going to listen to me and what I was feeling.

00:32:25.329 --> 00:32:32.529
One of the blessings that mom and dad gave me was teaching me how to think and meditate on

00:32:33.170 --> 00:32:41.890
scriptures. They encouraged us to sit full-time service or pioneering as a goal. We all worked

00:32:41.890 --> 00:32:51.089
part-time in my siblings and I remember one close family friend said to me, you know, your parents

00:32:51.089 --> 00:32:57.490
are getting older, you know, you're their daughter and you should probably work full-time.

00:32:57.569 --> 00:33:01.809
That way they have more of an easy life. After that sister's conversation,

00:33:02.609 --> 00:33:10.450
I almost gave up on pioneering but I knew deep down that my parents would not be happy about that.

00:33:10.450 --> 00:33:13.890
They wanted us to spend our youth in serving Jehovah.

00:33:15.089 --> 00:33:22.930
My husband and I were invited to attend the 145th class of Gilead and that was like a dream come true.

00:33:23.730 --> 00:33:29.250
I have to thank my parents for that because they always supported me through the years.

00:33:29.970 --> 00:33:35.250
I couldn't have done it without them and for that I'll be for ever grateful.

00:33:35.970 --> 00:33:43.089
I really do think my parents for the upbringing that they gave me. I have a very happy life.

00:33:43.809 --> 00:33:49.650
I'm thankful that I was able to avoid a lot of heartache and that's because

00:33:49.970 --> 00:33:54.369
my parents raised me in the truth in Jehovah's way.

00:33:55.089 --> 00:34:00.930
Children are born imitators and they're going to imitate our example.

00:34:01.569 --> 00:34:05.809
I want to take Jehovah for what our family is now.

00:34:07.009 --> 00:34:15.570
To see all of us in the pioneer work or five of us are pioneering. Thank you Jehovah.

00:34:17.780 --> 00:34:22.340
Raising three daughters took years of work and sacrifice.

00:34:23.619 --> 00:34:31.139
But Rudy and the need are joyful knowing their daughters are happily serving Jehovah full time.

00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:37.539
Likewise, if we build in our children fire resistant materials,

00:34:38.340 --> 00:34:43.780
then we give them everything they need to make wise decisions themselves.

00:34:44.340 --> 00:34:47.619
This was the case for Louise Blanton.

00:34:48.579 --> 00:34:55.380
Notice how her parents building techniques helped her to choose a fulfilling life.

00:34:58.179 --> 00:35:02.900
My family started studying with witnesses in New Jersey.

00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:08.659
My parents had been very diligent in helping us to appreciate not only Bible principles,

00:35:09.619 --> 00:35:14.420
but characters in the Bible that could be a role model for us.

00:35:15.539 --> 00:35:22.099
It helped us to know that Jehovah cared not only for adult publishers,

00:35:23.059 --> 00:35:26.500
but for the children that were serving him.

00:35:28.099 --> 00:35:34.260
When you went out in the ministry, it became such a common thing.

00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:36.739
The police would come and pick you up.

00:35:36.739 --> 00:35:41.619
If they couldn't track down the parents, they would put the children in jail

00:35:41.619 --> 00:35:45.619
knowing that eventually the parents would have to come looking for them.

00:35:46.739 --> 00:35:53.780
The police would use scare tactics that said there's rats in the cell.

00:35:53.780 --> 00:35:58.179
Is that where you want to be? Anything to make you fearful,

00:35:59.059 --> 00:36:02.420
to intimidate you to tell them where your parents were?

00:36:03.219 --> 00:36:08.980
They'd put us in the jail and in order to build our faith, we would see.

00:36:09.619 --> 00:36:14.420
We didn't have kingdom melodies back then, so we used to make up songs.

00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:20.260
And that would keep us focused on what we were doing there.

00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:28.099
After I reached the age of 18, my parents were agreeable to my accepting and assignment.

00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:34.579
And in those years, because of the racial issue in the south,

00:36:36.820 --> 00:36:43.139
there were so many areas in the south where they didn't have kingdom halls that the colored could attend.

00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:51.619
So if you were free and you would accept an assignment, the society usually sent us to the south.

00:36:52.340 --> 00:36:54.980
My parents were both born in the south.

00:36:55.940 --> 00:37:03.300
So they were able to tell us what to expect to keep the culture shocked from being so great.

00:37:04.980 --> 00:37:09.460
I was assigned to pioneer in Andalusia, Alabama,

00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:16.500
based on all of the matters that pertain to integration and segregation.

00:37:17.699 --> 00:37:24.019
This was a hotbed for testing those issues.

00:37:24.980 --> 00:37:34.019
And so I was concerned about whether I had the fiber just to work under those circumstances.

00:37:36.019 --> 00:37:42.980
The field was wide open. There were so many in the area that had no knowledge of

00:37:42.980 --> 00:37:50.900
Jehovah's Witnesses and very receptive to the message. That part of our ministry was very rewarding.

00:37:51.219 --> 00:38:06.420
We had some very strong and helpful brothers that Jehovah was using to get his people,

00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:13.300
no matter what color, to get them to appreciate him and his purpose.

00:38:14.420 --> 00:38:19.699
When you focused on these things, the suggestions and the ideas that the brothers would help you

00:38:19.699 --> 00:38:25.219
to appreciate, how to deal with issues that taught us for one thing.

00:38:26.420 --> 00:38:30.980
The whole purpose of the Ku Klux Klan is to intimidate.

00:38:32.340 --> 00:38:36.340
They feel that if they frighten you enough, you will leave.

00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:42.739
Satan has always used methods to try to intimidate.

00:38:43.539 --> 00:38:46.820
But we would make it a practice to stay, to hold our place.

00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:50.340
When we were in street work, we stayed right there.

00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:55.860
And of course, as they passed, they had their remarks to make.

00:38:56.980 --> 00:38:58.179
But we just stood there.

00:38:59.300 --> 00:39:06.260
When I think back on my youth, there isn't anything that I was able to participate in that I

00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:13.139
came to regret. There were always blessings that went along with it. You make yourself available.

00:39:13.139 --> 00:39:19.789
Jehovah will use you. Jehovah is always there as a support.

00:39:20.750 --> 00:39:28.909
There isn't anything that he directs his organization to do that doesn't receive his support.

00:39:29.949 --> 00:39:36.829
So if we are challenged with a new assignment or if we feel inadequate about it,

00:39:38.110 --> 00:39:43.230
if we look to Jehovah with Jehovah, you can't fail.

00:39:45.570 --> 00:39:51.489
Louise's parents taught her to appreciate principles and characters in the Bible.

00:39:52.690 --> 00:39:57.809
That reached her heart and aided Louise to endure difficult trials.

00:39:59.329 --> 00:40:03.969
She has now spent over 50 years of her life in the full-time service,

00:40:05.010 --> 00:40:08.769
including over 40 years in Bethel service.

00:40:08.769 --> 00:40:16.929
Hard work and sacrifice may also be needed to help our Bible students to become disciples.

00:40:18.050 --> 00:40:20.610
We'll see that in our next video.

00:40:25.329 --> 00:40:30.130
A teacher should always help his or her student to develop love for Jehovah.

00:40:32.050 --> 00:40:34.130
That's the best foundation to build on.

00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:40.340
For me, it's important that they see Jehovah as a real person.

00:40:40.900 --> 00:40:47.139
In order to help them build a good foundation, they need to know that Jehovah gave us the Bible

00:40:47.139 --> 00:40:50.980
so that we can receive his guidance for the future and for eternity.

00:40:53.980 --> 00:40:59.260
I'm so thankful for my Bible teacher. She always helped me see Jehovah's point of view

00:40:59.260 --> 00:41:06.739
on things from the Bible. I'll never stop thanking Jehovah for what he's done for me.

00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:13.380
He drew me to the truth. He gave me a teacher that didn't just teach me about the Bible,

00:41:13.380 --> 00:41:17.619
but by his example, the brother taught me how to really be one of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:41:20.340 --> 00:41:26.420
When I started studying, my parents told me that they didn't consider me their daughter anymore.

00:41:28.940 --> 00:41:34.059
During the study, my teacher helped me see from the Bible that Jehovah had a lot of really

00:41:34.059 --> 00:41:49.980
good things in store for me. My environment was very hostile before. My problem was that my wife

00:41:49.980 --> 00:41:58.579
and I argued a lot and I had a bad temper. The brothers' advice really helped us to keep calm

00:41:58.579 --> 00:42:07.760
when we had problems. When a person starts getting to know Jehovah and they learn and apply

00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:14.079
Bible truths in their lives, the people who were their friends before are going to disappear.

00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:25.039
We need to give them that friendship they're losing. We've had to make some sacrifices for our

00:42:25.039 --> 00:42:30.639
students, but when we think about the blessings, we can barely remember the sacrifices.

00:42:32.719 --> 00:42:39.599
I worked full time, but I had to adapt to the student's needs, not the other way around.

00:42:40.639 --> 00:42:44.480
Sometimes I would be up at six o'clock in the morning conducting a Bible study.

00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:51.280
Sometimes things come up and you can't make it, but the study should still happen.

00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:54.480
Another brother can study with them if we're not going to be there.

00:42:55.840 --> 00:43:02.400
When someone starts studying, it can feel like a lot. The Bible itself has 66 books.

00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:07.679
So for example, you can suggest that the student start reading a few verses every day

00:43:08.239 --> 00:43:14.480
and then add a little more every week. So that is how we see them progress. You get to see them

00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:18.800
practice what they're learning, really following the Bible's counsel in their lives.

00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:26.800
We don't just conduct a study, see them progress, get baptized and then say, okay, see you later.

00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:29.599
It doesn't work like that. They become part of our life.

00:43:32.460 --> 00:43:36.940
It's been my friend since before I got baptized. It's been about 28 years now.

00:43:38.380 --> 00:43:44.059
Years ago, my former student, Abel, had a really difficult time. His wife got sick.

00:43:45.739 --> 00:43:49.500
Although we were far away when we heard about it, we kept in touch with him.

00:43:53.260 --> 00:43:57.260
Thank you Livingstone family for calling Jessica during these hard times.

00:43:59.550 --> 00:44:04.670
It's very encouraging to us. I know that you love us and we also love you very much.

00:44:05.710 --> 00:44:09.389
You are an example in true worship for us.

00:44:10.190 --> 00:44:13.469
Major Hover, continue caring for you and blessing you.

00:44:22.369 --> 00:44:28.289
I got baptized 34 years ago and have been pioneering for 33 years.

00:44:28.369 --> 00:44:34.769
My Bible teacher was Shara. She was diagnosed with cancer.

00:44:35.570 --> 00:44:44.260
When I got sick, Jehovah used Mercedes to help me. After all this time, since I helped

00:44:44.260 --> 00:44:50.420
her learn the truth, now she comforts me. To father-son relationship.

00:44:52.099 --> 00:44:54.900
At some point, maybe this student will help me.

00:44:55.860 --> 00:45:01.139
And we can say that we're good for nothing slaves and we have done what we ought to have done.

00:45:01.780 --> 00:45:05.380
And they keep loving and serving Jehovah. What's better than that?

00:45:12.559 --> 00:45:18.000
To expand their ministry, many Jehovah's Witnesses have learned a new language.

00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:25.519
Have you? Teaching someone the truth in the language of their heart can be rewarding.

00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:31.440
But learning to speak and think in a new language can also be tough.

00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:38.880
In a recent morning worship, Brother William Malanfon offered some practical suggestions.

00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:46.880
Usually, the language that we learn from infancy becomes the language of the heart.

00:45:48.079 --> 00:45:54.880
And we learn it at home. In most cases, the dominant influence in our life, in connection with our

00:45:55.519 --> 00:46:01.599
language of heart or the first language, is our mother. And that's precisely what took place

00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:07.360
in Israel in the days of Nehemiah. But the mothers, in this case, were pagans,

00:46:08.079 --> 00:46:12.159
sharing their language and probably their beliefs with their children.

00:46:13.039 --> 00:46:17.840
And a lot of Jewish men, prominent Jewish men, had married pagan women.

00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:30.980
Let's read the scripture together at Nehemiah chapter 13 verses 23 and 24, Nehemiah 13, 23 and 24.

00:46:32.099 --> 00:46:40.260
It says, in those days, I also saw Jews who had married Ashtadite, Ammonite, and Moabite women.

00:46:41.300 --> 00:46:46.340
Half of their sons were speaking Ashtadite and the language of the different peoples.

00:46:47.059 --> 00:46:52.019
But none of them knew how to speak the language of the Jews.

00:46:53.860 --> 00:46:57.300
And as was stated, it's very likely that those mothers

00:46:58.260 --> 00:47:04.900
would be teaching the children about their land, their culture, and their worship, the pagan gods

00:47:04.900 --> 00:47:11.940
their worship. And so the decision was made by the Jews themselves when they were counseled

00:47:12.019 --> 00:47:19.619
in given direction from Ezra and from Nehemiah to send those wives away along with the children.

00:47:20.179 --> 00:47:24.900
And that's an interesting thing. It must have been a bit difficult for some husbands to see

00:47:24.900 --> 00:47:30.340
their children sent away. But all they knew were the languages of the pagan wives,

00:47:30.340 --> 00:47:35.940
nothing about Hebrew and the worship of Jehovah God. And the problem was, they were sent away

00:47:35.940 --> 00:47:41.539
to keep the Jews from losing their identity. By a gradual assimilation into the cultures

00:47:41.539 --> 00:47:46.179
and the religions of the surrounding nations that those wives belong to.

00:47:47.860 --> 00:47:54.659
In Nehemiah's day, speaking Hebrew was vital. And we're grateful it's not necessary today.

00:47:54.659 --> 00:47:59.940
We all don't have to learn Hebrew. But in his wisdom, Jehovah invites people who speak

00:47:59.940 --> 00:48:06.900
any language to learn the pure language, the truth about him and his purposes. And you know,

00:48:06.900 --> 00:48:12.579
it's a bit, it's like the opposite of what took place at the Tower of Babel, where Jehovah

00:48:12.579 --> 00:48:18.820
intervened, confused the builders of the Tower of Babel, imposing upon them different languages,

00:48:18.820 --> 00:48:24.420
including different ways of thinking. And so they went off, disorganized, separating from one

00:48:24.420 --> 00:48:30.019
another. And today we have people from all over the world who speak many, many different languages.

00:48:30.019 --> 00:48:36.099
But in Jehovah's wisdom, he's bringing them all together, those who love the truth and love him

00:48:36.820 --> 00:48:43.539
in unity. And this is what Zephaniah says. Zephaniah chapter 3 verse 9, it speaks of the pure

00:48:43.539 --> 00:48:51.460
language. I shall give to peoples the change to a pure language, in order for them all to call

00:48:51.460 --> 00:48:55.699
upon the name of Jehovah. And that's what these people do, who speak other languages. We reach

00:48:55.699 --> 00:49:01.860
them with the truth, but then they're unified with Jehovah's organization because it goes on to say

00:49:01.860 --> 00:49:08.820
in order to serve him, shoulder to shoulder. So isn't that interesting? The way Jehovah has used

00:49:08.820 --> 00:49:14.820
the pure language to bring people of many diverse backgrounds and languages together in his

00:49:14.820 --> 00:49:21.219
worship. In our days, people of many different languages are leaving their home countries to live

00:49:21.219 --> 00:49:27.219
elsewhere. And it's really quite amazing when you consider large cities are filled with people

00:49:27.380 --> 00:49:32.820
of different languages. And even little villages, we find people speaking different languages.

00:49:34.260 --> 00:49:43.889
They need help to learn the truth in the language of their heart. It's interesting to note about

00:49:43.889 --> 00:49:49.010
the Bethelites, how many have learned other languages in order to teach the truth to people.

00:49:49.650 --> 00:49:59.489
In the United States Bethel, in our branch, there are over 2,500 Bethelites who are engaged in

00:49:59.489 --> 00:50:05.809
congregations, 24 different language groups and congregations. So a lot of Bethelites and

00:50:05.809 --> 00:50:12.610
commuters are included in those numbers are doing a very fine work in helping people in the territory

00:50:12.610 --> 00:50:16.849
to learn the truth. And wouldn't it be nice? I know some of us would love to learn some other

00:50:16.849 --> 00:50:22.289
languages. Wouldn't it be lovely if we could learn the way a child does? They just absorb it. No

00:50:22.289 --> 00:50:27.969
effort and they start speaking it. A researcher, Dr. John Breerley says this,

00:50:28.769 --> 00:50:34.610
clearly the young brain seems to be programmed almost like a computer for language development.

00:50:35.409 --> 00:50:43.090
He notes that even brain anatomy suggests that an infant is born with a pre-programmed biological

00:50:43.090 --> 00:50:50.210
capacity to speak. And then comment, the comment in a wake said, it says, though the brain is hard

00:50:50.210 --> 00:50:56.929
wired to learn language. I'm sorry to say that the years go as the years go by, the hard

00:50:56.929 --> 00:51:07.599
wiring starts to fray a bit in many of us. But if we make the effort and we do make a switch to

00:51:07.599 --> 00:51:14.000
a congregation where they speak the language, what you would like to learn, remember this,

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:18.159
children can be a big help in the congregation that you attend in a foreign language.

00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:26.400
They can also be very startling in Frank. You speak funny. Why can't you pronounce that word

00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:32.960
properly? It's so easy. Well, yes, to you it's easy. You were raised with it. But that's how kids

00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:38.400
are. They don't realize the difficulties we have as we get older with the grooves being so deep

00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:42.880
and so thick in the brain with our original language that it's hard to get out of those grooves

00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:47.920
with vowels and consonants that we're not used to saying in a certain order.

00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:57.199
Keep a sense of humor. Listen to the kids. They'll help you. And don't be overly concerned about

00:51:57.199 --> 00:52:04.239
speaking a new language without an accent. Everybody has an accent. One way or another,

00:52:04.239 --> 00:52:09.760
some are more agreeable than others, but everyone has that. And some don't want to admit it,

00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:14.480
but they really do. They have an accent. Even when we all speak the same language, you can tell

00:52:14.480 --> 00:52:20.159
where a person is from, whether it's East, North, West, whatever it may be, South, there are

00:52:20.159 --> 00:52:26.000
accents or intonations the way words are pronounced. I remember years gone by for missionaries who

00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:31.760
were sent out into the field. We had to follow a special program and learning a new language. Your

00:52:31.760 --> 00:52:37.760
first month in your new assignment, you had to study 11 hours a day for 30 days, your first month,

00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:43.119
your new language. Well, you felt like you were in the tower of Babel on those occasions,

00:52:43.119 --> 00:52:47.840
because it was very difficult. The second month, you had to study your new language four hours

00:52:47.840 --> 00:52:54.800
a day and be out preaching 130 hours. Your third month, 150 hours in the field ministry and study

00:52:54.800 --> 00:53:01.679
language as you can. For those who are striving to learn a new language, here are a few suggestions

00:53:01.679 --> 00:53:09.039
I gleaned from a wake of March 2007 and the January issue of 2000. There are four points.

00:53:10.079 --> 00:53:21.199
One, motivation, two, humility, three, patience, four, practice. Motivation, you need an incentive,

00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:27.039
a reason to pursue your goal, because if you have a high level of motivation, you're going to be

00:53:27.039 --> 00:53:32.159
more successful. Well, we have the best motivation. There is. Teach people the truth.

00:53:32.159 --> 00:53:38.639
Praise our God, Jehovah. Build up the congregation we've chosen to attend. What about humility?

00:53:39.519 --> 00:53:45.519
Well, don't expect too much of yourself when you start learning a new language. Mistakes are

00:53:45.519 --> 00:53:52.000
inevitable. And if you wait until you can speak it perfectly before you start making comments or

00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:58.559
give a talk, you may be waiting quite a while. Be prepared, because it may not be until after

00:53:58.559 --> 00:54:04.639
arm again that you achieve that goal. So don't be afraid to make mistakes and carry on with your

00:54:04.639 --> 00:54:12.079
new language. Patients, a brother stated, for me, the first two years were difficult. And at times,

00:54:12.079 --> 00:54:20.239
I felt like giving up. Still, he acknowledges it does get easier as time goes by and he gets enjoyable.

00:54:21.199 --> 00:54:28.559
And number four, practice. A regular routine will help you to become fluent in your new language.

00:54:28.559 --> 00:54:32.880
Try to practice every day, even if it's for just a few minutes. There's an interesting saying,

00:54:32.880 --> 00:54:42.239
as one textbook puts it. A little and often is preferable to a lot, but seldom. So be steady,

00:54:42.800 --> 00:54:48.480
even for short periods of time in practicing the new language. Now, the fact is that most

00:54:48.480 --> 00:54:54.960
Bethelites in our branch are serving in the English language field. And they are truly a blessing

00:54:54.960 --> 00:55:00.880
to the congregations. The brothers are happy to have Bethelites who take the lead, who give of

00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:07.840
themselves and work hard to build up the congregation. So the decision to serve in an English congregation

00:55:07.840 --> 00:55:14.239
or with a different language group is highly personal. Whatever the decision may be,

00:55:14.960 --> 00:55:21.039
there's a key factor that we all have to keep in mind to maintain our spirituality at a high level

00:55:21.679 --> 00:55:28.320
and giving our Bethel assignment our best. And that key factor that we have to keep in mind

00:55:28.320 --> 00:55:36.000
is to focus on the one language that counts the most, the pure language that Jehovah God has given

00:55:36.079 --> 00:55:45.679
to His people. As we noted earlier, we can expect stormy tests and trials to come our way.

00:55:47.119 --> 00:55:53.199
But if we've built fire resistant materials in our children, our students, in ourselves,

00:55:54.000 --> 00:56:00.800
we will stand firm. We'll see that in our beautiful new music video.

00:56:20.300 --> 00:56:35.780
Jehovah in a world that is new. Love grew in my heart right up to this day. I know this world wants

00:56:35.780 --> 00:59:35.789
to pull me away. I'm the sun. I will not lose where we don't stand. What an encouraging song.

00:59:37.309 --> 00:59:44.989
And to further help you stand firm against trials, a new video will be released later this month

00:59:45.070 --> 00:59:53.869
entitled Firm Under Opposition. This 10-minute video consists of segments from two previous

00:59:53.869 --> 01:00:01.789
documentaries that touch the hearts of many. Jehovah's Witnesses stand firm against Nazia Salt

01:00:02.429 --> 01:00:08.030
and faithful under trials. Jehovah's Witnesses in the Soviet Union.

01:00:08.989 --> 01:00:15.789
So please look for this video that combines the highlights of the two previous programs.

01:00:16.670 --> 01:00:26.300
It will strengthen and help you remain faithful to Jehovah. The theme of this month's program was

01:00:27.179 --> 01:00:36.219
let each one keep watching how he is building. We saw how first-time parents can successfully embrace

01:00:36.219 --> 01:00:43.099
their new responsibilities. By setting a good example, Rudy and the Nita helped their

01:00:43.099 --> 01:00:51.900
three daughters reach meaningful spiritual goals. Louise received fine training from her parents

01:00:51.900 --> 01:01:01.940
which has helped her to enjoy a fulfilling life. Cecilia and Shira made sacrifices to be effective

01:01:02.019 --> 01:01:08.260
Bible teachers and their efforts made a real difference in the lives of their students.

01:01:10.690 --> 01:01:18.289
Before we close, let's visit our brothers and sisters in Nigeria. Nigeria is the most

01:01:18.289 --> 01:01:26.050
populous country in Africa. It's some 200 million people speak over 500 languages.

01:01:27.010 --> 01:01:33.969
More than 400,000 Jehovah's Witnesses live and preach there. Many publishers come from other

01:01:33.969 --> 01:01:40.050
lands to share in the ministry. The response to the good news is very encouraging.

01:01:41.250 --> 01:01:50.050
More than 870,000 Bible studies are conducted every month. On average, about 40 people are baptized

01:01:50.050 --> 01:01:59.170
every day and seven new congregations are formed every month. This is the Obudu Ranch congregation.

01:01:59.969 --> 01:02:05.969
Their territory is beautiful, vast, and mountainous, literally in the clouds.

01:02:06.929 --> 01:02:16.050
23 publishers including two special pioneers serve here. To reach areas only accessible by foot,

01:02:16.690 --> 01:02:23.730
the publisher sometimes walk for eight hours. The terrain is challenging, but the long walk provides

01:02:23.730 --> 01:02:30.289
opportunities for up building association. After working the territory, our brothers stay

01:02:30.289 --> 01:02:39.170
overnight and walk back another eight hours. Our brothers and sisters in the Obudu Ranch congregation

01:02:39.250 --> 01:02:46.530
send their warm love and greetings. From the World Headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses,

01:02:46.530 --> 01:02:53.889
this is J.W. Broadcast.
