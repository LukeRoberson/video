00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:15.929
The book of Hosea is packed with spiritual treasure, wouldn't you say?

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.929
Yeah, absolutely. It reveals aspects of Jehovah's personality, his sovereignty,

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:25.929
and there's so much we can apply ourselves. We just have to know how to find the treasure.

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:28.929
In that case, let's dig into Hosea.

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:30.929
Love too.

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.929
So a good way to start is by watching the introduction to Hosea video.

00:00:34.929 --> 00:00:38.929
It gives an overview of the book. It helps us to understand the historical context

00:00:38.929 --> 00:00:42.929
and most importantly, it shows how it connects to God's kingdom.

00:00:42.929 --> 00:00:44.929
That's a great study tip.

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:46.929
Hey, thanks.

00:00:46.929 --> 00:00:51.929
The video mentioned that Hosea's career as a prophet continued for about 60 years

00:00:51.929 --> 00:00:54.929
during a time of great political turmoil in Israel.

00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:58.929
That wouldn't have been an easy assignment on its own,

00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:03.929
but we can start to dig deeper by asking some questions.

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:07.930
Asking questions is such a fundamental step in digging for treasures.

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.930
So for example, how did Jehovah choose to start Hosea's prophetic career?

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.930
Hosea 1-2 says,

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.930
Go, marry a woman of prostitution, and have children of prostitution.

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.930
Yeah, can you imagine the first thing that Jehovah tells you as a prophet

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.930
is that he wants you to marry a woman who's going to be unfaithful to you?

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.930
I wonder how he felt.

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.930
What was his initial response?

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.930
What went through his mind, knowing that marital infidelity awaited him?

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:46.930
Many who have gone through that circumstance say that it's an excruciating and devastating experience.

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.930
But that's not all.

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:54.930
That verse also mentions have children of prostitution.

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.930
So there were children involved.

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.930
Hosea and Gomorrah had a son together, but later Gomorrah had two other children,

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.930
likely out of wedlock.

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:06.930
I wonder what that was like for Hosea.

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.930
Right? And if they weren't his, when did he find out?

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.930
How did he feel taking care of these children?

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.930
There are so many questions we can ask to make the account real.

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.930
Now, I've been asked this before, and I'm sure you have two.

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:28.930
Why would Jehovah ask Hosea to put himself in such a painful family situation?

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.930
It doesn't seem right.

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.930
How would you respond to that?

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.930
Why is such an important question when we're digging for treasures?

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.930
So think about it.

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.930
Jehovah really told him why, in that same verse where he commissioned him.

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:49.930
Because by prostitution, the land has turned completely away from following Jehovah.

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.930
The all scripture book says,

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:58.930
Israel had been the Jehovah like a wife who had become unfaithful, committing fornication.

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.930
Yet he would show his love for her and try to recover her.

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.930
Hosea's wife, Gomorrah, could accurately illustrate this.

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:13.930
So by having Hosea experience something similar to what Jehovah was going through with Israel,

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.930
Hosea could better empathize and communicate how deeply the people had hurt Jehovah.

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:24.930
Yeah, I can only imagine the weight that gave to Hosea's words.

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.930
Now, here's the big question.

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.930
What does this reveal about Jehovah's personality?

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.930
What stands out to you?

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.930
Here's something surprising about this account.

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.930
How, Jehovah told Hosea to take Gomorrah back.

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.930
Hosea chapter 3 verse 1 says,

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:50.930
Go once again, love the woman who is loved by another man and is committing adultery.

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:56.930
Just as Jehovah loves the people of Israel while they turn to other gods.

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:01.930
Hosea taking Gomorrah back wasn't to be mechanical.

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.930
Jehovah told Hosea to love this woman again.

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:10.930
Yeah, that's a much different response than simply pretending everything is okay.

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:12.930
That's restoration.

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.930
So it shows that even though Jehovah was deeply hurt,

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:20.930
he still loved Israel and wanted them to return.

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.930
And not just out of obligation,

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.930
he wanted to restore that loving intimate relationship.

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.930
That's Jehovah's loyal love.

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.930
What a glimpse into Jehovah's personality.

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:35.930
And really, his sovereignty.

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:39.930
He is not only loyal, he is a god of loyal love.

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.930
Outstanding.

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:43.930
Okay, so the next step.

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:45.930
Make it personal.

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.930
The study tips on the back of the watchtower suggest

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.930
identify lessons and apply them.

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:53.930
So what's a takeaway?

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:57.930
Disloyalty causes Jehovah so much pain.

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.930
But the opposite is also true.

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:02.930
When we imitate Jehovah's loyal love,

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.930
he must be so pleased.

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:09.930
So when we do our best to maintain a loving atmosphere in our marriage,

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:11.930
even though it isn't easy,

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:13.930
or if we feel mistreated,

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:15.930
when we are loyal to our brothers and sisters

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.930
and work to restore a damaged relationship,

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:20.930
even when they hurt us,

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:23.930
we make Jehovah happy.

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:25.930
Yeah, we're imitating him.

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:27.930
It's not mechanical.

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:29.930
It's an act of loyal love.

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:31.930
We don't just forgive.

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:33.930
We love.

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:35.930
Another takeaway.

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:38.930
Maybe we've hurt Jehovah by our actions in the past.

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:43.930
Those memories may stay with us even if we've repented and gained forgiveness.

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:46.930
We might find it hard to forgive ourselves.

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.930
But that's not how Jehovah wants us to feel.

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:51.930
Just like with the Israelites,

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:57.930
he still wants to be our god and assure us of his forgiveness and loyal love.

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:02.930
Remembering this account can give us peace when we've made a mistake.

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:07.930
Look at what we can find with just a few steps,

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:10.930
getting an overview from the introduction video,

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:14.930
asking questions to dig into the details and context,

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:18.930
looking for what it teaches us about Jehovah's personality

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:20.930
and then making it personal.

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:24.930
The book of Hosea is packed with such gems.

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:27.930
And we didn't even dig everything out of those verses.

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:31.930
Why did Jehovah require Hosea to pay to buy Gomer back?

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:34.930
What do the names of the children reveal about Jehovah?

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:38.930
Why did Jehovah hold out a hope of a future king from David's line?

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:42.930
How can I imitate Hosea's example of accepting challenging assignments?

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:45.930
There is still so much there.

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:47.930
Then let's keep going.

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:51.930
There's no end to the treasure we can find in the book of Hosea.
