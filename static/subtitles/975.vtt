WEBVTT

00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:11.039
We cannot express to you baptism candidates around the world how much of a privilege it is for us to share in this occasion with you.

00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:22.039
You are following through on the most important decision you've ever made to make it known publicly that you have dedicated your life to God.

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:25.039
We know your situation is very.

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:33.039
Some of you candidates were raised knowing about Jehovah, but you had to develop your own personal relationship with him.

00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:44.039
Others of you may be taking this step after learning about Jehovah more recently, but whatever your circumstances, likely it was a journey.

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:49.039
A figurative road you had to travel to get to this point.

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:58.039
In fact, the Bible also compares true worship to a road, a path, or a walkway that has to be traveled.

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:12.040
In Acts 9 verse 2, as the first century Christian congregation was being established, Jesus disciples used the term the way to designate their newly established form of worship.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:24.040
They understood that as baptized Christians, they were walking on a new path and every aspect of their lives was involved.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.040
And that's going to be the case for you as well.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:33.040
In fact, note how the Bible describes this. Turn with me please to the book of Ephesians.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:43.290
And know what is stated in Ephesians chapter 4 and will read verses 22 through 24.

00:01:43.290 --> 00:02:02.950
There it says, you were taught to put away the old personality that conforms to your former course of conduct and that is being corrupted according to its deceptive desires.

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.949
And you should continue to be made new in your dominant mental attitude.

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:17.949
And you put on the new personality that was created according to God's will in true righteousness and loyalty.

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:23.949
So like the first century Christians, you have come to know the truth about Jehovah.

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:29.949
And the things you've learned has led you to become baptism candidates.

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:36.949
Like all of God's people, you've done as verse 22 states to put away the old personality.

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:47.949
But there in verse 23, we must also continue to be made new in our dominant mental attitude.

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:54.949
This involves our thoughts, what will allow our mind to dwell on.

00:02:54.949 --> 00:03:03.949
Now you note the footnote for that verse indicates this term could also be rendered as the force actuating our mind.

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:09.949
Or literally translate it to the spirit of your mind.

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:15.949
In the English language, perhaps you've heard someone say that they are in good spirits.

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:21.949
Or you've heard someone described as being mean spirit it.

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:26.949
Well, that's a description of one's dominant mental attitude.

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:29.949
One's thoughts and motivations.

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:34.949
It's what moves us to act the way that we do.

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:49.360
Our goal as baptized servants of Jehovah is to gain a dominant mental attitude that aligns and is in harmony with God's thoughts.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.360
Now that won't always be easy.

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.360
It takes time and a lot of effort.

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:01.360
Those who walk in the way of peace often encounter trials.

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:08.360
And to stay on that road, we must be willing to make sacrifices.

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:15.360
Like some of those first century Christians, we may have to endure direct persecution.

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:22.360
But if we continue to walk in Jehovah's way, we're going to be happy.

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.360
And Jehovah is going to bless us.

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:34.360
At Luke chapter 1 verse 79, he assures us that he will guide our feet in the way of peace.

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.360
That's a comforting thought, isn't it?

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.360
So we're excited.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.360
We're excited that you baptism candidates have undertaken this journey.

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:51.360
And know that you have some eight and a half million other witnesses on this road with you.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:58.360
And today, it is our honor and privilege to welcome you.

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:07.149
To welcome you to Jehovah's way of peace and the road leading off into life.

00:05:07.149 --> 00:05:11.149
As we go through our discussion today, we're going to answer three questions.

00:05:11.149 --> 00:05:19.149
First, why is it important that we do not give up on walking in Jehovah's way of peace?

00:05:19.149 --> 00:05:25.149
Second, how does walking in Jehovah's way bring us peace?

00:05:25.149 --> 00:05:34.149
And third, what can we do to continue walking in Jehovah's way of peace?

00:05:34.149 --> 00:05:36.149
Well, let's address our first question.

00:05:36.149 --> 00:05:43.149
Why is it important that we do not give up in walking in Jehovah's way of peace?

00:05:43.149 --> 00:05:50.170
And I answer that, let's turn please to 2 Corinthians chapter 4.

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:56.170
And we'll note 2 Corinthians chapter 4 verses 16 through 18.

00:05:56.170 --> 00:06:04.060
There it reads, therefore, we do not give up.

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:13.060
But even if the man we are outside is wasting away, certainly the man we are inside is being renewed from day to day.

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:23.060
For though the tribulation is momentary and light, it works out for us a glory that is of more and more surpassing greatness and is everlasting.

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:30.060
While we keep our eyes not on the things seen, but on the things unseen.

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:38.720
For the things seen are temporary, but the things unseen are everlasting.

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:41.720
Do you see why we can't give up?

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:48.720
It's because being one of Jehovah's Witnesses requires that we remain active and persevere in the way of peace.

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:57.970
You dear candidates have not given up in your efforts to please Jehovah and to qualify to become part of His people.

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:00.970
And why is that?

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:02.970
It's because of your love for Him.

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:10.970
And you know that any trials and obstacles you face now are momentary and light

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:15.970
when compared to an eternity in God's new world.

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:20.970
Today you will enter into a special relationship with Jehovah God.

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:27.970
So don't let anyone or anything jeopardize that relationship.

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:35.970
Let it be something that you cherish because that relationship is everlasting.

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:39.970
So keep walking in Jehovah's way of peace.

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:46.970
Focus on what it means to have Him as a friend, to have Him guiding your steps.

00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:56.970
If you don't give up, then despite any trials you face, you will continue to enjoy Jehovah's blessings.

00:07:56.970 --> 00:07:59.970
And we're confident that you can do so.

00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:03.970
But to highlight how this can be done.

00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:08.970
At this time, we're pleased to introduce Sister Endira Alfonso.

00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:17.970
Sister Alfonso was baptized in 2006 and now serves with her husband as Bethel family members in Warwick.

00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:26.970
Sister Alfonso, can you tell us a little about your journey, how you became associated with Jehovah's Witnesses?

00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:30.970
Yes, I was born in Cuba. My mom and I moved to the United States when I was nine.

00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:33.970
Even though I was young, I felt it was important to look for God.

00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:40.970
So whenever we moved, I would visit the local churches in the area, even getting baptized in a number of them.

00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:45.970
When I was 11, my mom let me move in with my aunt, who was one of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:52.970
And from there, she asked my mom if I could study with a pioneer sister from her congregation, and my mom agreed.

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:57.970
Well, nice to see that even at a young age, you had a spiritual need.

00:08:57.970 --> 00:09:06.970
So during this time leading up to your baptism as one of Jehovah's Witnesses, did you encounter any trials that threatened to make you give up?

00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:13.970
Yes, I did. I made changes very quickly. I stopped celebrating holidays, stopped praying to idols.

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:18.970
But these changes were very strange to my mom, just difficult for her to understand.

00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:21.970
She really was afraid I was being brainwashed.

00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:29.970
So after studying for several months, she had me moved back in with her, which meant the end of my studies and no more attending meetings.

00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:34.970
It wasn't long before my association was affecting my speech and my behavior.

00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:39.970
I found myself easily influenced to even celebrate my birthday again.

00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:43.970
I could feel I was moving further away from Jehovah instead of closer to him.

00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:46.970
I'm sorry to hear that sister Alfonso.

00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:51.970
So what helped you not to give up and to go on walking in the way of peace?

00:09:51.970 --> 00:09:56.970
What helped me was this scripture in Matthew 1037, where Jesus said,

00:09:56.970 --> 00:10:01.970
whoever has greater affection for father or mother than for me is not worthy of me.

00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:06.970
I realized that a peaceful relationship with Jehovah might mean no peace with my family.

00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:12.970
But I knew that if I were to ever gain my mom, I had to walk with Jehovah the right way and not give up.

00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:17.970
So one night I prayed to him, crying for forgiveness and asking for his help.

00:10:17.970 --> 00:10:23.970
Until my surprise a few days later, without any explanation, my mom had me moved back in with my aunt.

00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:26.970
So I resumed my Bible studies.

00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:29.970
And after a year later, at the age of 15, I got baptized.

00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:33.970
Jehovah clearly heard and answered your prayer.

00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:38.970
Since then, have you seen continued evidence of Jehovah's guidance?

00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:42.970
A good friend helped me to adjust the way I was communicating with my mom.

00:10:42.970 --> 00:10:47.970
So one day I called her and expressed to her, how much I truly appreciate and love her.

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:50.970
I didn't want us to be distant anymore.

00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:57.970
I explained to her that my love for her had never changed, but my love for Jehovah had come first.

00:10:57.970 --> 00:11:00.970
So that conversation was a turning point for us.

00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:05.970
Now we have had many positive discussions and she's much more understanding of my decision.

00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:11.970
Seeing Jehovah's guidance in my life makes me determined to continue walking in his way of peace.

00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:13.970
Thank you so much, Sister Alfonso.

00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:20.659
We appreciate your faithful example and comments.

00:11:20.659 --> 00:11:23.659
Well, let's address our second point.

00:11:23.659 --> 00:11:28.659
How does walking in Jehovah's way bring us peace?

00:11:28.659 --> 00:11:35.659
To answer this, we're going to compare the path or journey you've taken on the road to life

00:11:35.659 --> 00:11:38.659
with a literal road or walkway.

00:11:38.659 --> 00:11:43.659
And in making this comparison, we find a number of similarities.

00:11:43.659 --> 00:11:52.659
First, both roads have boundaries, a purpose, and a destination.

00:11:52.659 --> 00:11:56.659
Let's start with that first one, boundaries.

00:11:56.659 --> 00:12:04.659
On a literal road, we may see yield or do not interest signs, guard rails on the side of the road,

00:12:04.659 --> 00:12:08.659
or lines on the road to help us stay in our lane.

00:12:08.659 --> 00:12:10.659
Well, those are boundaries.

00:12:10.659 --> 00:12:14.659
And those boundaries are there for our protection.

00:12:14.659 --> 00:12:20.659
Because if we step outside of them, we risk getting hurt or lost.

00:12:20.659 --> 00:12:29.259
It would be great if we could tell you that as you continue on the road to life after your baptism,

00:12:29.259 --> 00:12:33.259
we would love to say that the rest of your journey is smooth sailing.

00:12:33.259 --> 00:12:38.019
You'll have nothing but safe travels.

00:12:38.019 --> 00:12:45.019
But the reality is that you will face challenges and test of your faith.

00:12:45.019 --> 00:12:48.019
The devil will make sure of it.

00:12:48.019 --> 00:12:53.019
He will make sure that you are confronted with temptations.

00:12:53.019 --> 00:12:59.019
He wants to do whatever he can to damage your special relationship with Jehovah.

00:12:59.019 --> 00:13:03.330
But we're confident that you can succeed.

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:13.330
You can be successful and avoid danger if you remain within the boundaries of Jehovah's way of peace.

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:16.330
How do you stay within those boundaries?

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:23.330
By continuing to learn about Jehovah's laws and principles, and obeying them.

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:30.330
That obedience will not only protect you, but it will give you inner peace.

00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:34.330
Peace that comes from having a clean conscience.

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:45.059
The next similarity between a literal road and being on the road to life that we'll discuss is having a purpose.

00:13:45.059 --> 00:13:54.059
When we travel on a literal road, our plan usually is not to get on the road and just stand still.

00:13:54.059 --> 00:14:00.059
To become stationary or watch other people or vehicles go by.

00:14:00.059 --> 00:14:03.059
No, we're there for a reason.

00:14:03.059 --> 00:14:10.059
The purpose of the road is to enable movement, to help us get from one place to another.

00:14:10.059 --> 00:14:22.059
Well, in a similar sense, being on Jehovah's way of peace allows you to move forward, to make continual spiritual progress.

00:14:22.059 --> 00:14:27.059
And, of course, there are many ways that we can make spiritual advancement.

00:14:27.059 --> 00:14:35.059
One important way that all Christians can do so is in cultivating spiritual qualities.

00:14:35.059 --> 00:14:38.059
This is so pleasing to Jehovah.

00:14:38.059 --> 00:14:46.860
Consider with me, for example, Galatians chapter 6, verse 10.

00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:53.659
Notice what's mentioned here, Galatians chapter 6, verse 10.

00:14:53.659 --> 00:14:58.659
It's as soven as long as we have the opportunity.

00:14:58.659 --> 00:15:07.659
Let us work what is good toward all, but especially toward those related to us in the faith.

00:15:07.659 --> 00:15:19.659
So one way to advance spiritually is to look for ways to do good things for others, both inside and outside, the congregation.

00:15:19.659 --> 00:15:24.659
This pandemic has afforded us many opportunities to do this.

00:15:24.659 --> 00:15:29.659
We've been able to call and check on others, and distribute food or supplies when needed.

00:15:29.659 --> 00:15:37.659
And think of what our brothers have done, time and again, to assist others during natural disasters.

00:15:37.659 --> 00:15:42.659
So take a minute and think about your local area.

00:15:42.659 --> 00:15:48.159
How can you work what is good toward all?

00:15:48.159 --> 00:15:53.159
Are there ones that need assistance getting food or running errands?

00:15:53.159 --> 00:16:00.470
Is there someone who could use a good word of encouragement to cheer them up?

00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:07.470
Do we know individuals who have lost loved ones in death, with whom we could share words of comfort?

00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:11.470
Or maybe simply provide a listening ear?

00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:20.470
You see, by displaying spiritual qualities, qualities such as kindness, compassion, hospitality, generosity,

00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:26.470
you're going to feel deeply rewarded for doing these things.

00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:39.470
And you're pleasing Jehovah, because you will show that your purpose for being on the road to life is not just to save yourself, but to help others.

00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:48.360
And there was a third similarity between being on a literal road and being on the road to life.

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:55.360
In both cases, we have a destination that we want to reach.

00:16:55.360 --> 00:17:00.360
Traveling on a literal path will eventually take you to your destination.

00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:09.359
And as a witness of Jehovah, our journey, our walk on this figurative road will lead us to our destination.

00:17:09.359 --> 00:17:16.769
The goal of enjoying a peaceful friendship with God forever.

00:17:16.769 --> 00:17:30.660
Although we long for that time in God's new world, even now we can experience the blessings and inner peace that come from a life of service to Jehovah.

00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:34.660
We now have the privilege to speak with Sister Gloria Hurd.

00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:43.660
Sister Hurd has been baptized for over 70 years and has enjoyed a rich spiritual life and special full-time service with her husband,

00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:47.940
but the Samuel heard of the governing body.

00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:56.940
Sister Hurd, you've had many rich spiritual blessings, and we know that you've encountered challenges along the way.

00:17:56.940 --> 00:18:03.940
But as you've carried out these assignments through the years, walking in Jehovah's way of peace,

00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:07.940
how have you managed to enjoy greater inner peace?

00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:14.940
I learned, Brother Turner, that if Jehovah gives you an assignment, he will give you what you need to fulfill it.

00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:18.940
We learned and really benefited from the traveling overseas and their wives.

00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:22.940
It was such a privilege to serve along with these faithful brothers and sisters,

00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:26.940
and several of them had served me and my family when I was very young.

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:36.940
So to see their faithfulness, to see their happiness, and to see that they really had inner peace really benefited me.

00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:39.940
I learned from that, and I wanted to follow their example.

00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:44.940
That help from others can be so valuable. How else have you managed?

00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:48.940
I've enjoyed inner peace too from praying to Jehovah a lot.

00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:57.940
Many times we had very little money or no money, but we never missed a meal and we never missed any theocratic event.

00:18:57.940 --> 00:19:02.940
We learned that having no money is not an obstacle to Jehovah.

00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:10.940
He heard our prayers, he answered them, and it was if the blessing sometimes just fell out of heaven.

00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:14.940
Prayer can be so powerful. Thank you for sharing that.

00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:20.940
But now, how has walking in Jehovah's way of peace helped you to have peace with others?

00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:26.940
I worked and lived with many sisters, and they all had different personalities.

00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:30.940
So I learned that I had to apply Ruma's 12-18, where it says,

00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:36.940
as far as it depends upon me, be peaceable with all men and women.

00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:44.940
So I learned that I have to adjust my personality sometimes to keep peace.

00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:55.940
This happened very often, but one time we moved in with a sister on Tuesday morning, and something I said upset her very much.

00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:57.940
She got very angry.

00:19:57.940 --> 00:20:03.940
Well, I decided not to pursue the issue, because I had to live with her for a week.

00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:10.940
And I just decided to let her see by my conduct that I could never have met what she thought.

00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:19.940
So as the week by, the days went by, the tension lessened, and by Monday, when we left, we were the best of friends.

00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:23.940
And she gave me a big hug, and nothing more was said about the subject.

00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:28.940
Well, it sounds like you handled that beautifully sisterhood. Your spiritual qualities were evident.

00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:35.940
Well, finally, how has walking in Jehovah's way of peace helped you have peace with God?

00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:43.940
Well, when you see Jehovah acting your behalf over and over and over again, it makes you feel that you have his approval.

00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:53.940
Now that Sam and I are in our senior years, we feel he has given us the desire of our heart by allowing us to serve at Bethel, which had been our goal for many years.

00:20:53.940 --> 00:21:00.940
And I know that as long as I stay faithful to Jehovah, he will continue to grant me inner peace.

00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:09.940
And we have that confidence as well. Thank you so much, sisterhood. We deeply appreciate your comments and your encouraging expressions.

00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:16.559
Well, let's now address our final point.

00:21:16.559 --> 00:21:21.559
What can we do to continue walking in Jehovah's way of peace?

00:21:21.559 --> 00:21:25.559
Well, let's go back to our illustration of the road.

00:21:25.559 --> 00:21:34.559
On a literal road, travelers may need to make adjustments in response to changing road conditions or bad weather.

00:21:34.559 --> 00:21:45.559
Similarly, as you go on walking in the way of peace, you will need to readjust your actions and thinking from time to time.

00:21:45.559 --> 00:21:51.559
Recently, a circuit overseer shared an interesting point regarding our thoughts and attitudes on matters.

00:21:51.559 --> 00:21:58.559
He said that they could either serve as a prison or a passport.

00:21:58.559 --> 00:22:11.559
A prison in that our thoughts and actions can confine or restrict us or a passport in that they can take us where we need to be.

00:22:14.029 --> 00:22:20.029
Well, right now, we need to be and stay on this road to life.

00:22:20.029 --> 00:22:34.029
So we want to make sure that any needed adjustments are made in our thoughts and our actions so that we're not confined or restricted in making spiritual progress.

00:22:34.029 --> 00:22:40.029
Well, what might be some areas that we'll need to make adjustments?

00:22:40.029 --> 00:22:59.339
Notice, please, Paul's words in 2 Corinthians chapter 13, and we'll read 2 Corinthians chapter 13 verse 11.

00:22:59.339 --> 00:23:15.339
Paul says, finally, brothers, continue to rejoice, to be readjusted, to be comforted, to think in agreement, to live peaceably, and the God of love and of peace will be with you.

00:23:15.339 --> 00:23:22.880
Did you notice three areas in this verse where Paul states we can make adjustments?

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:28.880
First, he says, continue to rejoice.

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:35.880
We can lose our peace and joy if we become overwhelmed by the anxieties of life.

00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:44.880
So in order to rejoice, can you make it a goal to focus on things that bring joy rather than sadness?

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:57.319
So if you're not feeling well or coping with chronic pain, you can focus on God's promise when no one will say, I am sick.

00:23:57.319 --> 00:24:12.319
If you're facing beliefs or opposition for your beliefs, focus on the fact that we're part of a brotherhood, a brotherhood that supports and prays for us, and arrangements are in place to keep us spiritually strong.

00:24:14.819 --> 00:24:25.819
If you're discouraged by world events, you can rejoice in the fact that you have a hope for the future, and we know how this all ends.

00:24:25.819 --> 00:24:29.819
We know that better times are ahead.

00:24:29.819 --> 00:24:36.819
The point is, don't let negative thoughts restrict or limit your progress.

00:24:36.819 --> 00:24:44.819
Instead, make the needed adjustments so that you can move forward and continue to rejoice.

00:24:44.819 --> 00:24:50.230
Not another area for readjustment, Paul mentions in verse 11.

00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:56.230
There he says, continue to think in agreement.

00:24:57.230 --> 00:25:04.230
There were members of the congregation back in the first century that were promoting apostate ideas.

00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:12.230
Others were introducing controversial ideas that were not directly unscriptural, but that were divisive.

00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:21.230
This resulted in bickering and arguing, arguments, over words, really creating a spiritually unhealthy atmosphere.

00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:27.230
What's going to help us to continue to think in agreement?

00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:31.230
Remember Paul's words at 2 Timothy 2, 23.

00:25:31.230 --> 00:25:39.230
To reject foolish and ignorant debates, knowing that they produce fights.

00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:46.230
Of course, we react strongly when facing issues that clearly violate Jehovah's moral laws.

00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:56.230
But if no scriptural principle is being violated, we're wise to abstain from promoting our personal opinions.

00:25:56.230 --> 00:26:06.230
We want to do all we can to avoid starting or being drawn into disagreements that can disrupt the peace of the congregation.

00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:17.119
Now, back in verse 11, a third area where we can make adjustments is continue to live peaceably.

00:26:17.119 --> 00:26:24.819
Did you notice from the interview with our sisters what they both did when challenged?

00:26:24.819 --> 00:26:29.819
Would face with the challenge that threatened their peace?

00:26:29.819 --> 00:26:32.819
They took the matter to Jehovah in prayer.

00:26:32.819 --> 00:26:36.819
They reflected on scriptures found in God's Word.

00:26:36.819 --> 00:26:42.819
And then they looked to see how they could apply those verses in their particular situation.

00:26:43.819 --> 00:26:50.819
It helped them to not only have inner peace, but peace with others as well.

00:26:50.819 --> 00:26:55.819
So let your spiritual qualities shine through.

00:26:55.819 --> 00:27:02.819
Continue to work on keeping peace, showing those qualities of being loving and generous toward all.

00:27:02.819 --> 00:27:10.829
But especially with our close family members, whether they are witnesses or not.

00:27:10.829 --> 00:27:21.829
Well, we want to conclude by reminding you baptism candidates that today marks a significant milestone in your journey, in your relationship with Jehovah.

00:27:21.829 --> 00:27:28.829
So take the time to appreciate what this day means for you.

00:27:28.829 --> 00:27:31.829
We're so proud of all of you.

00:27:31.829 --> 00:27:39.829
You will never regret the decision you have made to dedicate your life to Jehovah.

00:27:39.829 --> 00:27:46.829
But keep in mind that after today and beyond, the journey is not yet over.

00:27:46.829 --> 00:27:49.829
Really it's just the beginning.

00:27:49.829 --> 00:27:55.829
So we encourage you to do all you can to stay on the road to life.

00:27:55.829 --> 00:27:58.829
Keep in mind the points we consider today.

00:27:58.829 --> 00:28:03.829
First, do not give up on walking in Jehovah's way of peace.

00:28:03.829 --> 00:28:06.829
Your life depends on it.

00:28:06.829 --> 00:28:09.829
Allow Jehovah to guide your steps.

00:28:09.829 --> 00:28:14.829
Second, stay within the boundaries on the road to life.

00:28:14.829 --> 00:28:21.829
Remember, you're walking with a purpose, and that will lead you to your destination.

00:28:21.829 --> 00:28:25.829
Peaceful friendship with Jehovah forever.

00:28:25.829 --> 00:28:33.829
And finally, keep making any needed adjustments in your thoughts, your attitude and actions,

00:28:33.829 --> 00:28:38.829
so that you can maintain peace with Jehovah and peace with others.

00:28:38.829 --> 00:28:43.829
If you continue to do these things, not only will you have peace,

00:28:43.829 --> 00:28:48.829
but as the last part of Second Corinthians 13 and 11 says,

00:28:48.829 --> 00:28:53.829
the God of love and of peace will be with you.

00:28:53.829 --> 00:29:02.829
May you always remember that promise, which Jehovah makes to those who go on walking in the way of peace.
