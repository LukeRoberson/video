00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:14.560
Back in Bible times, a young woman named Dina got involved with bad associations.

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:16.559
What were the consequences?

00:00:16.559 --> 00:00:21.559
Cast members of a modern-day drama we call the Bible account.

00:00:21.559 --> 00:00:23.559
Dina was the daughter of Jacob.

00:00:23.559 --> 00:00:27.559
She moved along with Jacob's family to a new area.

00:00:27.559 --> 00:00:33.560
The scriptures say that she used to go out to visit the jodders of the land.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.560
It was a custom with her.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:42.600
She was putting herself in a compromising situation.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.600
At some point, a Kenanite man named Jacob noticed her.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.600
He was the most honorable man in his father's house.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.600
But he was still not a worshiper of Jehovah.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.600
He was handsome. He had his pick of women.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.600
But there was something about Dina that must have attracted him.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.599
It had a lot to do with her innocence and her inexperience.

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:09.599
She was a virgin. She was not like all these other Kenanite girls.

00:01:09.599 --> 00:01:13.599
She put herself in a compromising situation.

00:01:13.599 --> 00:01:17.599
She allowed herself to be alone when she came where he took advantage of the situation.

00:01:17.599 --> 00:01:25.159
They might have just started talking or laughing about something and one thing leads to another.

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:32.159
I'm sure it would have been devastating because he forced her to have sex.

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:38.519
She got herself into this situation.

00:01:38.519 --> 00:01:47.409
And that she'd hurt not only her family, her father, her parents, but Jehovah too.

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:53.409
Even though the Dina account is from history, it still definitely applies today.

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:56.409
This kind of situation can definitely happen.

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:02.409
I think this drama is going to help a lot of people, kids and adults,

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:20.580
to see that what happened to Dina could happen to any of us if we let it.

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.580
Dear Chrissy, sorry it's taken me so long to answer your letters.

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.580
It was pretty crazy around here for a while.

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.580
Anyway, I want you to know that I'm okay.

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:40.530
But Chrissy, something you said in your last letter worried me.

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.530
You said that you thought the friends at the Kingdom Hall were boring,

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.530
and that the kids at school were a lot more fun.

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:55.180
If you knew what I've been through recently, you'd understand why I'm worried.

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.180
You've probably wondered why I haven't written you since we moved here.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.180
I guess I've been too ashamed.

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.180
But now I think I need to tell you.

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:17.740
I understood why we had to move, with Dad getting the new job and everything.

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:22.080
But that didn't make things any easier.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:34.810
I was leaving behind all my friends.

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.810
Mom and Dad were so busy with our new home and their new jobs.

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:45.750
I didn't want to burden them with how miserable I felt.

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.000
I started writing poetry again.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
It seemed to take my mind off my loneliness.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:02.740
At the new congregation, Mom and Dad were eager to make new friends.

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:05.740
I had a major attitude problem.

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:10.740
Well, there was nice meeting you, Tara.

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:14.729
Yeah, same here.

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:16.730
Wonder what we were talking about.

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:18.730
Hey! You must be Tara.

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:19.730
Hi.

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:20.730
Hi.

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:22.730
I just met your parents. They are so nice.

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:24.730
Thanks.

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:27.730
Well, anyway, my name is Stacy.

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:29.730
You mind if I sit down?

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:33.730
There was this pioneer sister, Stacy Evans.

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:35.730
She tried really hard to be nice.

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:38.730
So, I hear you're from Luinda Falls?

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:39.730
Lucinda Falls.

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:41.730
Oh, Lucinda Falls, sorry.

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:43.730
Pretty small town, huh?

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:45.730
It's not that small.

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:47.730
Oh, sorry. I didn't mean to.

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:55.379
It must be pretty hard being away from all your friends, huh?

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:57.379
Excuse me, brothers.

00:04:57.379 --> 00:05:00.379
Could everyone please find their seats?

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:03.379
Stacy, it was nice meeting you.

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:07.379
I just wasn't ready to make any new friends.

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:14.069
Chrissy, I had never, ever felt so alone.

00:05:14.069 --> 00:05:18.069
And school was the final brushstroke on this portrait of misery.

00:05:18.069 --> 00:05:26.579
I felt so out of place.

00:05:26.579 --> 00:05:28.579
It was like I didn't even exist.

00:05:28.579 --> 00:05:35.199
A few weeks later, though, things seemed to change for the better.

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:38.199
It was in Mr. Beck with Singlish class.

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:50.540
Not Pete Falls.

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:53.540
What are we going to do with the party?

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:58.589
That's what we're going to do.

00:05:58.589 --> 00:06:00.589
Get another question, whatever you're going to do.

00:06:00.589 --> 00:06:02.589
Thank you.

00:06:02.589 --> 00:06:05.589
This past weekend, while you were out partying,

00:06:05.589 --> 00:06:09.589
this overworked and underpaid English teacher

00:06:09.589 --> 00:06:15.589
spent his weekend reading your poems.

00:06:15.589 --> 00:06:20.189
Take this masterpiece, for example.

00:06:20.189 --> 00:06:27.189
I think I shall never see a guy as cool as Anthony's.

00:06:27.189 --> 00:06:31.189
He's very strong and cute and tall.

00:06:31.189 --> 00:06:41.129
I like to show him up in the shopping mall.

00:06:41.129 --> 00:06:44.129
And guess who authored this work of art?

00:06:44.129 --> 00:06:46.129
My skateboard makes a sound.

00:06:46.129 --> 00:06:49.129
What is the ground that can be by Pete?

00:06:49.129 --> 00:06:51.129
No, Mr. B, you got to read it with a little rhythm,

00:06:51.129 --> 00:06:53.129
little style, some attitudes.

00:06:53.129 --> 00:06:56.129
He's sick, Kyle, sick.

00:06:56.129 --> 00:07:01.560
Some of you did write verses

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:04.560
that rightly can be called lyrical poetry.

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:09.560
Now we'll have that select few present their poems before the class.

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:14.699
Sorry, Miss Taylor.

00:07:14.699 --> 00:07:17.699
Not this time.

00:07:17.699 --> 00:07:24.420
First up, Miss Tara Manson.

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:25.420
Great.

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:28.420
As if being the new kid in class wasn't bad enough.

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:40.980
Now I had to be put on public exhibition.

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:42.980
I was sick.

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:47.639
I remember the day I caught loneliness.

00:07:47.639 --> 00:07:52.670
Okay, come on.

00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:54.670
I remember the day I caught loneliness.

00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:56.670
It was the day we moved away.

00:07:56.670 --> 00:07:58.670
It lay like a stone in my lap.

00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:01.670
No matter how I tried, prying, tearing,

00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:03.670
it simply would not go away.

00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:06.670
I never knew emptiness until I moved away.

00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:10.670
I remained a pebble, lost in this world so vast and uncaring.

00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:14.670
Cast aside, passed by, left astray.

00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:18.670
I took steps to destroy it before it sapped me, crushed me, left me victim.

00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:21.670
I pulled harder, ripping that stone right from my heart

00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:25.670
and threw it all back into the void from where it came.

00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:30.670
Yes, I had thrown loneliness away.

00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:32.669
Thank you, Miss Manson.

00:08:32.669 --> 00:08:34.669
Excellent work.

00:08:34.669 --> 00:08:37.669
Notice her use of simile when she says,

00:08:37.669 --> 00:08:39.669
it laid like a...

00:08:39.669 --> 00:08:42.669
Her weeks I had been invisible to these kids.

00:08:42.669 --> 00:08:44.669
Suddenly, they noticed me.

00:08:44.669 --> 00:08:45.669
Thank you.

00:08:45.669 --> 00:08:47.669
Do you know what this shows me?

00:08:47.669 --> 00:08:50.669
That you're all capable of writing poetry.

00:08:50.669 --> 00:08:54.669
It's just a matter of making the effort.

00:08:54.669 --> 00:08:56.669
Don't forget people.

00:08:56.669 --> 00:08:58.669
New Friday, dramatic dialogue,

00:08:58.669 --> 00:09:00.669
being suffering laws,

00:09:00.669 --> 00:09:05.909
ponder optional.

00:09:05.909 --> 00:09:08.909
So, you're a math genius too.

00:09:08.909 --> 00:09:10.909
Oh, hi, Laurie.

00:09:10.909 --> 00:09:13.909
And some kind of frustrated poet,

00:09:13.909 --> 00:09:15.909
just waiting to be discovered.

00:09:15.909 --> 00:09:17.909
I wouldn't say that.

00:09:17.909 --> 00:09:19.909
Well, Mr. Beckwisher jeweled over your poetry.

00:09:19.909 --> 00:09:24.909
So, so, I figured you're the one to help me with the class assignments.

00:09:24.909 --> 00:09:26.909
You mean the dramatic dialogue?

00:09:26.909 --> 00:09:31.379
Yeah, theme, suffering loss.

00:09:31.379 --> 00:09:35.379
Anyway, I have to get an A on it.

00:09:35.379 --> 00:09:37.379
Why are you flunking English?

00:09:37.379 --> 00:09:40.379
Oh, but I gotta pull my grades up in order to get into college.

00:09:40.379 --> 00:09:44.379
So, I figure you're the one to help me with this.

00:09:44.379 --> 00:09:47.379
I was planning on working on it by myself.

00:09:47.379 --> 00:09:51.379
Come on, Tara. Mr. B said we could use a partner.

00:09:51.379 --> 00:09:55.379
Look, Laurie, I'm sorry, but I like to work alone when I write.

00:09:55.379 --> 00:09:58.379
Please, don't make me back.

00:09:58.379 --> 00:10:01.379
I actually felt sorry for her.

00:10:01.379 --> 00:10:04.379
Is that a yes?

00:10:04.379 --> 00:10:05.379
I guess.

00:10:05.379 --> 00:10:09.379
Yes, okay. I'll pick you up tomorrow and you can go to my place.

00:10:09.379 --> 00:10:12.379
Your place? Why can't we just do it here?

00:10:12.379 --> 00:10:14.379
This place is gross.

00:10:14.379 --> 00:10:16.379
Besides, we'll have a lot more privacy.

00:10:16.379 --> 00:10:20.340
Okay, ciao.

00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:24.340
Going to her house wasn't exactly what I had in mind.

00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:28.340
But at the time, I couldn't think of any way to get out of it.

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:33.340
And I have to admit, I was a little curious about this girl.

00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:45.230
We both had a serious case of writer's block.

00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:50.340
Back what drives me crazy with these assignments?

00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:56.480
I mean, what does suffering loss mean?

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:58.480
Didn't he say it to me, whatever we want it to mean?

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:00.480
So, we make something up.

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:03.480
Like what?

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:08.480
Like, when your parents make you move away and you lose everything you care about.

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:10.480
Tell me about it.

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:12.480
What? You too?

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:20.580
Hey, I wasn't always the picture of charm and fashion that you see before you today.

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:23.580
We used to live in a small house in a small town.

00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:26.580
And then dad hit it big in the stock market.

00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:27.580
And voila!

00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:29.580
Goodbye, friends.

00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:31.580
Hello loneliness.

00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:34.580
I don't know why I'm telling you all this.

00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:35.580
That's it.

00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:37.580
That's what.

00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:38.580
The loss.

00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:41.580
We do a dramatic dialogue about the loss of friendship.

00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:44.580
You mean about friends moving away?

00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:46.580
No, a little too close to our home.

00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:49.580
Then how about because they've had a fight?

00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:51.580
About what?

00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:54.580
Hello about guys.

00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:56.580
What else do girls fight about?

00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:59.580
Finally, the ideas were flowing.

00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:03.580
We got together again the next day.

00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:05.580
So there's two women.

00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:08.580
And we can make them really old.

00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:10.580
Like, 30.

00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:13.580
Yeah, and they're both hopelessly in love with this guy Jake.

00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:15.580
Jake? Nah.

00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:16.580
Brett.

00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:18.580
Okay, Brett.

00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:20.580
As I got to know Laurie,

00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:24.580
my opinion of her began to change.

00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:28.580
I never would have guessed that we had so much in common.

00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:33.080
It's a great pictures.

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:34.080
Who's this?

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:36.080
Oh, that was my best friend Misty.

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:39.080
We used to do everything together.

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:42.080
Anyway, that's our old house.

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:45.080
Can you believe it?

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:47.080
Don't you miss it sometimes?

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:49.080
Yeah, a little.

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:52.080
But mostly my friends.

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:56.080
So, from our 1320 says,

00:12:56.080 --> 00:13:00.080
he that is walking with wise persons will become wise,

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:04.080
but he that is having dealings with the stupid ones will fair badly.

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:07.080
Now when the Bible says stupid ones,

00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:10.080
it's not talking about people who are unintelligent,

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:14.080
but about people who do not follow godly standards.

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:16.080
All I could think about

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:19.080
was getting together again with Laurie.

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:21.080
You can't have him, Alexandra.

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:22.080
Brett is mine.

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:23.080
Perfect.

00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:26.029
Let's take it from the top.

00:13:26.029 --> 00:13:28.029
You can't have him, Alexandra. Brett is mine.

00:13:28.029 --> 00:13:31.860
Yours, Brett Kimberly.

00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:33.860
What about me, Alexandra?

00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:34.860
That's the problem, Kimberly.

00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:37.860
It's always been about you.

00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:41.860
Doesn't our friendship mean anything at all to you?

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:43.860
Our friendship?

00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:45.860
Write it off as a lost honey.

00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:47.860
Your loss, my game.

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:50.860
Okay, so we weren't ready for Broadway.

00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:52.860
But the class loved it.

00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:59.039
Oh, we could go.

00:13:59.039 --> 00:14:04.139
I couldn't stand this girl.

00:14:04.139 --> 00:14:07.139
Suddenly, Laurie's friends didn't mind being seen with him.

00:14:07.139 --> 00:14:08.139
All to you.

00:14:08.139 --> 00:14:09.139
Oh, it's so free.

00:14:09.139 --> 00:14:11.139
You guys should try out for the school play.

00:14:11.139 --> 00:14:14.139
Okay, no, that was just for an A.

00:14:14.139 --> 00:14:17.139
But you have definitely earned a seat at this table top.

00:14:17.139 --> 00:14:19.139
Yeah, we had an opening for a literary genius.

00:14:19.139 --> 00:14:21.139
Aaron, please, I'm no genius.

00:14:21.139 --> 00:14:23.139
Ooh, and so modest.

00:14:23.139 --> 00:14:29.690
If I had your talent,

00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:31.690
I'd question on it.

00:14:31.690 --> 00:14:32.690
What do you mean?

00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:36.690
Hello scholarships, a career thing.

00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:37.690
Money?

00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:38.690
Guys.

00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:39.690
And money.

00:14:39.690 --> 00:14:40.690
And guys.

00:14:40.690 --> 00:14:43.690
No, it's just a hobby for me.

00:14:43.690 --> 00:14:46.690
So what do you plan to do, Flip Burgers?

00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:49.690
Well, I need to do something to support myself,

00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:51.690
but I really want to help people.

00:14:51.690 --> 00:14:54.690
What, you mean like a social worker or something?

00:14:54.690 --> 00:14:56.690
No, more like volunteer work.

00:14:56.690 --> 00:14:59.690
Oh, and tear work.

00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:02.690
Yeah, I mean, we teach people.

00:15:02.690 --> 00:15:03.690
Teach what?

00:15:03.690 --> 00:15:05.690
Hello, teachers don't make any money.

00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:07.690
No, let me explain.

00:15:07.690 --> 00:15:09.690
You see, we're...

00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:11.690
Well, I mean, I want to...

00:15:11.690 --> 00:15:15.740
Hold that for.

00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:16.740
Yeah?

00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:17.740
Hey, Joanna.

00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:18.740
Oh, cool.

00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:20.740
Of course I'll be there.

00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:21.740
All right.

00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:22.740
Ciao.

00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:24.740
Summer Clarence Girls, today only.

00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:26.740
Tara, you can't miss it.

00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:27.740
I don't think I can.

00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:28.740
I don't have any money with me.

00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:29.740
Have no fear.

00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:31.740
Denny's credit card is here.

00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:33.740
Besides, I owe you big time.

00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:37.740
Hey, maybe we can get her out of her mislew in the falls outfit.

00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:38.740
It's Lucinda Falls.

00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:39.740
What?

00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:41.740
And besides, what's wrong with my outfit?

00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:49.340
Now I was in Laurie's circle of friends.

00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:52.340
But I had to make a few changes to fit in.

00:15:52.340 --> 00:16:01.789
Hello, Mark.

00:16:01.789 --> 00:16:03.789
In your English class, Mark.

00:16:03.789 --> 00:16:06.789
He's been checking you out ever since your little poetry reading.

00:16:06.789 --> 00:16:07.789
He's cute.

00:16:07.789 --> 00:16:08.789
And Daddy has big bucks.

00:16:08.789 --> 00:16:11.789
That's mentioned that he's recently become a villain.

00:16:11.789 --> 00:16:13.789
I could definitely see you two together.

00:16:13.789 --> 00:16:14.789
Together?

00:16:14.789 --> 00:16:16.789
I don't want to be together with anyone.

00:16:16.789 --> 00:16:18.789
We could set you up.

00:16:18.789 --> 00:16:21.789
Well, if he's so great, how can none of you are interested in him?

00:16:21.789 --> 00:16:23.789
I'm seeing somebody already.

00:16:23.789 --> 00:16:24.789
Ditto.

00:16:24.789 --> 00:16:25.789
And I'm with Anthony.

00:16:25.789 --> 00:16:26.789
Remember, he's in college.

00:16:26.789 --> 00:16:27.789
Thank you.

00:16:27.789 --> 00:16:30.789
Besides, I'm not into the sensitive intellectual type.

00:16:30.789 --> 00:16:33.789
Yeah, just set like that last mutant you were dating.

00:16:33.789 --> 00:16:35.789
But until I actually charged her.

00:16:35.789 --> 00:16:39.789
Don't even get me started on some of the losers you've dated anyway.

00:16:39.789 --> 00:16:42.789
You are interested aren't you, Tara?

00:16:42.789 --> 00:16:43.789
Well, no.

00:16:43.789 --> 00:16:45.789
I mean, I don't know.

00:16:45.789 --> 00:16:47.789
Don't really, Tara.

00:16:47.789 --> 00:16:49.789
We'll arrange everything.

00:16:49.789 --> 00:16:52.789
I'll arrange what?

00:16:52.789 --> 00:16:54.789
Arrange what?

00:16:54.789 --> 00:16:58.789
The girl's also figured I needed a little help with my social life.

00:16:58.789 --> 00:17:01.789
Mark, she's way different from the other girls you've dated.

00:17:01.789 --> 00:17:04.789
I mean, she's in a charity and volunteering and that sort of stuff.

00:17:04.789 --> 00:17:07.789
She wants to be a social worker or something like that.

00:17:07.789 --> 00:17:09.789
Oh, hi, Tara.

00:17:09.789 --> 00:17:11.789
Mark, you are so funny.

00:17:11.789 --> 00:17:12.789
Hi, Tara.

00:17:12.789 --> 00:17:13.789
Hi, Tara.

00:17:13.789 --> 00:17:15.789
We saved a seat just for you.

00:17:15.789 --> 00:17:16.789
Thanks.

00:17:16.789 --> 00:17:18.789
You know, Mark, Chandler, don't you?

00:17:18.789 --> 00:17:20.789
Yeah, we're in the same English class.

00:17:20.789 --> 00:17:22.789
And you are the great poet and playwright.

00:17:22.789 --> 00:17:23.789
Yeah, right.

00:17:23.789 --> 00:17:25.789
No, I'm serious.

00:17:25.789 --> 00:17:29.789
You were really great.

00:17:29.789 --> 00:17:33.789
So, how do you like life near the big city?

00:17:33.789 --> 00:17:36.789
Well, I haven't actually seen the city yet.

00:17:36.789 --> 00:17:37.789
Get out.

00:17:37.789 --> 00:17:38.789
What are you doing?

00:17:38.789 --> 00:17:39.789
You're not at school.

00:17:39.789 --> 00:17:46.009
I'm meatloaf day.

00:17:46.009 --> 00:17:48.009
Get the pizza.

00:17:48.009 --> 00:17:49.009
Yeah.

00:17:49.009 --> 00:17:50.009
There you go.

00:17:50.009 --> 00:17:51.009
Thanks.

00:17:51.009 --> 00:17:53.009
Isn't it so sweet?

00:17:53.009 --> 00:17:57.009
Anyway, I'm usually with my parents.

00:17:57.009 --> 00:17:58.009
Hey, what are you doing, Saturday?

00:17:58.009 --> 00:17:59.009
We could show her.

00:17:59.009 --> 00:18:00.009
Yeah.

00:18:00.009 --> 00:18:01.009
Play tour guides.

00:18:01.009 --> 00:18:02.009
Why not?

00:18:02.009 --> 00:18:03.009
Sounds like fun.

00:18:03.009 --> 00:18:05.009
So what do you say?

00:18:05.009 --> 00:18:06.009
I don't know.

00:18:06.009 --> 00:18:08.009
I have to be up early on Sunday.

00:18:08.009 --> 00:18:09.009
We'll start early.

00:18:09.009 --> 00:18:10.009
We'll get back early.

00:18:10.009 --> 00:18:11.009
There you go.

00:18:11.009 --> 00:18:12.009
Come on, dad.

00:18:12.009 --> 00:18:14.509
Well, I guess so.

00:18:14.509 --> 00:18:15.509
All right.

00:18:15.509 --> 00:18:16.509
We're on.

00:18:16.509 --> 00:18:17.509
So we'll meet after lunch.

00:18:17.509 --> 00:18:18.509
Yeah.

00:18:18.509 --> 00:18:19.509
And I'll pick you up at your house.

00:18:19.509 --> 00:18:20.509
Great.

00:18:20.509 --> 00:18:21.509
That's OK.

00:18:21.509 --> 00:18:22.509
I'll just get a ride to Laurie's.

00:18:22.509 --> 00:18:24.509
I never would have admitted it.

00:18:24.509 --> 00:18:27.509
But I did think Mark was cute.

00:18:27.509 --> 00:18:29.509
And a day with the girl sounded like fun.

00:18:29.509 --> 00:18:33.740
Right?

00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:35.740
That Saturday morning, I went out and field service

00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:37.740
with Stacey Evans.

00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:46.119
But my mind was not unpreaching.

00:18:46.119 --> 00:18:52.430
I told Stacey that I was hungry and wanted to stop service early.

00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:55.430
She insisted on buying me lunch.

00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:56.430
OK.

00:18:56.430 --> 00:18:57.430
Here's your salad.

00:18:57.430 --> 00:18:58.430
Thanks.

00:18:58.430 --> 00:19:00.430
It'll be a couple minutes on your burger.

00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:01.430
Thanks.

00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:10.000
So how are you doing?

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.000
I mean, getting used to the new school and everything.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.000
OK, actually.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.000
Most everyone's been pretty nice.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.000
Oh, that's good.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.519
Hey, listen.

00:19:20.519 --> 00:19:22.519
I'm having some friends over tonight.

00:19:22.519 --> 00:19:23.519
I want you to come.

00:19:23.519 --> 00:19:25.519
I actually made a cheesecake that I'm proud of.

00:19:25.519 --> 00:19:30.519
I'd love to, but I promise to go into the city with some friends.

00:19:30.519 --> 00:19:32.519
Oh, from our home?

00:19:32.519 --> 00:19:34.519
No, from school.

00:19:34.519 --> 00:19:36.519
But they're just going to show me around the city.

00:19:36.519 --> 00:19:39.519
They're real nice.

00:19:39.519 --> 00:19:42.519
Look, I hope you don't mind me asking this.

00:19:42.519 --> 00:19:45.519
But how well do you really know these kids?

00:19:45.519 --> 00:19:46.519
What do you mean?

00:19:46.519 --> 00:19:50.519
I mean, do they have any interest in the Bible?

00:19:50.519 --> 00:19:51.519
I don't know.

00:19:51.519 --> 00:19:52.519
It hasn't come up.

00:19:52.519 --> 00:19:55.519
But they're not into drugs or anything like that.

00:19:55.519 --> 00:20:00.519
In fact, they're even nicer than some of the kids at the Kingdom Hall.

00:20:00.519 --> 00:20:07.519
Well, even if that were true, don't you think you have to be careful with people,

00:20:07.519 --> 00:20:13.960
people who may not even believe in the Bible?

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:15.960
Don't forget what happened to Dina.

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:16.960
Dina?

00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:19.960
Yeah, remember Jacob Stoddard?

00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:25.329
These kids are not cana-nice.

00:20:25.329 --> 00:20:27.329
They're very nice.

00:20:27.329 --> 00:20:28.329
Maybe.

00:20:28.329 --> 00:20:31.329
But what are their beliefs?

00:20:31.329 --> 00:20:45.230
What are their morals?

00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:50.230
So you're saying that I shouldn't be friendly with anyone in school who is in a witness?

00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:52.230
No, no, I'm not saying that at all.

00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:56.230
I mean, the Bible tells us to love our neighbors.

00:20:56.230 --> 00:21:01.230
But doesn't it also warn us that it's dangerous to get too close to certain people?

00:21:01.230 --> 00:21:04.230
People that don't follow God's standards?

00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:08.890
Dina learned that the hard way.

00:21:08.890 --> 00:21:14.549
But don't we have to teach people about the Bible?

00:21:14.549 --> 00:21:17.549
How can I do that if I don't spend any time with them?

00:21:17.549 --> 00:21:20.549
Oh, so you have had a chance to witness today?

00:21:20.549 --> 00:21:22.549
Well, no.

00:21:22.549 --> 00:21:25.549
But that's not the point.

00:21:25.549 --> 00:21:28.549
Laurie and her friends are not bad.

00:21:28.549 --> 00:21:29.549
Okay.

00:21:29.549 --> 00:21:33.549
But do they encourage you to do good things?

00:21:33.549 --> 00:21:39.549
Like, like personal study, meetings, field service.

00:21:40.549 --> 00:21:41.549
No.

00:21:41.549 --> 00:21:46.059
Look, Stacey, I've already given my word.

00:21:46.059 --> 00:21:51.059
And Jesus did say I have to let my yes mean yes, right?

00:21:51.059 --> 00:21:58.059
Tara, do you really think Jesus meant saying yes to things that can hurt you?

00:21:58.059 --> 00:22:01.059
Stacey, I'll be careful.

00:22:01.059 --> 00:22:04.059
I'm not going to do anything stupid.

00:22:04.059 --> 00:22:05.059
Trust me.

00:22:05.059 --> 00:22:17.009
Here's your burger, honey.

00:22:17.009 --> 00:22:24.299
Stacey's words affected me far more than she realized.

00:22:24.299 --> 00:22:31.019
But I had already made up my mind.

00:22:31.019 --> 00:22:36.019
I lied to my parents and told them I have plans with some friends from the congregation.

00:22:36.019 --> 00:23:07.250
At first, we pretty much stayed together as a group.

00:23:07.250 --> 00:23:10.250
But soon, Mark and I were talking.

00:23:10.250 --> 00:23:17.349
I really enjoyed the attention.

00:23:17.349 --> 00:23:19.349
But you know he was stone when he wrote those phones.

00:23:19.349 --> 00:23:21.349
You write better when you're high?

00:23:21.349 --> 00:23:23.349
No, I'm not into drugs.

00:23:23.349 --> 00:23:24.349
Are you?

00:23:24.349 --> 00:23:36.349
You know that used to be the tallest building in New York?

00:23:36.349 --> 00:23:39.349
Mark made me feel special.

00:23:39.349 --> 00:23:43.349
And the more I got to know him, the more I liked him.

00:23:43.349 --> 00:23:45.349
It's a nice dream, right?

00:23:45.349 --> 00:23:47.349
It was about hard.

00:23:47.349 --> 00:24:47.930
I wasn't going to let anything spoil this day.

00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:49.930
He's never stopped you before.

00:24:49.930 --> 00:24:51.930
Why are we going home so early?

00:24:51.930 --> 00:24:52.930
Aaron's right.

00:24:52.930 --> 00:24:54.930
This place doesn't even get going until after dark.

00:24:54.930 --> 00:24:55.930
That's true.

00:24:55.930 --> 00:24:56.930
And if we leave now, all we're going to do is sit and traffic.

00:24:56.930 --> 00:24:58.930
Why don't we hit a couple of clubs?

00:24:58.930 --> 00:25:05.910
Flat tires, something.

00:25:05.910 --> 00:25:06.910
Oh, yes.

00:25:06.910 --> 00:25:12.390
No, I better get home.

00:25:12.390 --> 00:25:17.009
We'll have no fear.

00:25:17.009 --> 00:25:20.009
Thanks to me, or evening will not be a total waste.

00:25:20.009 --> 00:25:23.009
Oh, so you're leaving?

00:25:23.009 --> 00:25:28.650
Stunned your growth?

00:25:28.650 --> 00:25:29.650
You lost.

00:25:29.650 --> 00:25:30.650
Good stuff.

00:25:30.650 --> 00:25:35.140
The best.

00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:37.140
Hey, my parents are gone.

00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:39.140
A little party in my place.

00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:40.140
Too bad to.

00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:41.140
You're missing out.

00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:47.609
Never mind.

00:25:47.609 --> 00:25:50.609
Well, we're going to get tear back home before she was there bedtime.

00:25:50.609 --> 00:25:54.609
To be honest, Chrissy, I probably would have stayed.

00:25:54.609 --> 00:25:56.609
But it was getting dark.

00:25:56.609 --> 00:25:59.609
And I knew I'd never get away with coming home that late.

00:25:59.609 --> 00:26:01.609
Hey, don't forget about that party.

00:26:01.609 --> 00:26:03.609
I swear I got a guy there.

00:26:03.609 --> 00:26:05.609
All right, see you later.

00:26:05.609 --> 00:26:07.609
Bye, Mark.

00:26:07.609 --> 00:26:13.579
Mark told me he didn't mind taking me home.

00:26:13.579 --> 00:26:14.579
Oh, Mark, you want to make a next left?

00:26:14.579 --> 00:26:17.579
Wait, Tara, there's one more place you've got to see.

00:26:17.579 --> 00:26:19.579
Mark, I've got to get home.

00:26:19.579 --> 00:26:20.579
I'll get you home.

00:26:20.579 --> 00:26:21.579
Trust me.

00:26:21.579 --> 00:26:22.579
Mark.

00:26:46.529 --> 00:26:48.529
This is your favorite spot?

00:26:48.529 --> 00:26:50.529
Sure is.

00:26:50.529 --> 00:26:54.529
What may I ask is so special about it?

00:26:54.529 --> 00:26:57.529
Sometimes I just like to come here and think.

00:26:57.529 --> 00:26:59.529
About what?

00:26:59.529 --> 00:27:01.529
Things.

00:27:01.529 --> 00:27:07.529
Like, how to tell your father you don't want to go to law school and work for the firm?

00:27:07.529 --> 00:27:10.529
Isn't there good money in it?

00:27:10.529 --> 00:27:14.859
I don't care about the money.

00:27:14.859 --> 00:27:16.859
I want to help people.

00:27:16.859 --> 00:27:20.859
Maybe teacher, do volunteer work.

00:27:20.859 --> 00:27:22.859
You sound like me.

00:27:22.859 --> 00:27:23.859
Really?

00:27:23.859 --> 00:27:24.859
Well, yeah.

00:27:24.859 --> 00:27:28.859
Mark seemed to care about a lot of the things that were important to me.

00:27:28.859 --> 00:27:32.859
Before I knew it, we had been talking for over an hour.

00:27:32.859 --> 00:27:33.859
I don't know.

00:27:33.859 --> 00:27:35.859
So Kyle's flying down the hallway,

00:27:35.859 --> 00:27:37.859
back with just right in front of him.

00:27:37.859 --> 00:27:38.859
Boom!

00:27:38.859 --> 00:27:40.859
Kyle and back with flat on their backs.

00:27:40.859 --> 00:27:41.859
Oh, no.

00:27:41.859 --> 00:27:45.859
Kyle's spent his entire sophomore year in detention for that.

00:27:46.859 --> 00:27:55.140
Tara, you know what?

00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:57.140
Oh, never mind.

00:27:57.140 --> 00:27:58.140
No, what?

00:27:58.140 --> 00:28:04.220
You're different from the other girls, aren't you?

00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:05.220
Different?

00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:08.220
Is that supposed to be a compliment?

00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:09.220
Yeah.

00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:13.220
I mean, I've never met anyone like you.

00:28:13.220 --> 00:28:16.220
I could tell from your poem.

00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:20.220
Well, you know, I was really impressed with your poem, too.

00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:22.220
No, well, thanks.

00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:25.220
But yours told me something.

00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:27.220
Told you what?

00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:30.220
That you've got a lot going on inside.

00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:34.220
I mean, Laurie and the other girls are okay,

00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:38.220
but they're also empty.

00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:41.220
You're different.

00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:46.220
Chrissy, I can't believe how close I came to breaking Jehovah's laws that night.

00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:51.549
Things went way too far.

00:28:51.549 --> 00:28:59.190
And Mark wanted to go much farther.

00:28:59.190 --> 00:29:00.190
But I couldn't.

00:29:00.190 --> 00:29:11.309
I kept thinking about how much it would hurt my parents, my friends,

00:29:11.309 --> 00:29:13.309
and especially Jehovah.

00:29:13.309 --> 00:29:18.869
Still, it wasn't easy.

00:29:18.869 --> 00:29:23.869
It took everything I had to stop and to get Mark to take me home.

00:29:23.869 --> 00:29:24.869
Tara?

00:29:24.869 --> 00:29:30.339
Mark revealed a side of himself that I hadn't seen before.

00:29:30.339 --> 00:29:34.579
I just don't get it.

00:29:34.579 --> 00:29:37.579
Things were going so great.

00:29:37.579 --> 00:29:40.579
What is it with you?

00:29:40.579 --> 00:29:44.579
Mark didn't care about me or my feelings.

00:29:44.579 --> 00:29:46.579
He wanted one thing.

00:29:46.579 --> 00:29:52.579
Later on, I learned I wasn't the first or the last to be taken to his favorite spot.

00:29:52.579 --> 00:29:53.579
I got to go.

00:29:53.579 --> 00:30:05.299
I felt so stupid, so naive.

00:30:05.299 --> 00:30:08.299
It was wrong to be alone like that with any guy.

00:30:08.299 --> 00:30:11.299
But especially one who didn't serve Jehovah.

00:30:11.299 --> 00:30:21.980
I let Mark know that I would never go out with him again.

00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:24.980
That night, I told my parents everything.

00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:26.980
They were very upset.

00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:31.579
Are you sure you told us everything?

00:30:31.579 --> 00:30:33.579
Nothing else happened?

00:30:33.579 --> 00:30:35.579
No, Dad. I told you.

00:30:35.579 --> 00:30:37.579
You've been telling us a lot of things.

00:30:37.579 --> 00:30:40.579
I don't know what to believe anymore.

00:30:40.579 --> 00:30:42.579
Honey, what were you thinking?

00:30:42.579 --> 00:30:44.579
Didn't you get it?

00:30:44.579 --> 00:30:46.579
What do you think he took you there?

00:30:46.579 --> 00:30:49.920
Don't you know what he wanted?

00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:54.160
I can't believe this.

00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:58.160
After a while, things started to calm down.

00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:00.160
And they really listened.

00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:06.950
Tara, it took a lot of courage to tell us all that.

00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:09.950
Sorry, I got swaying free.

00:31:09.950 --> 00:31:11.950
That's okay, Dad.

00:31:11.950 --> 00:31:16.519
I just wish I came to you and mom sooner.

00:31:16.519 --> 00:31:19.519
Maybe this wouldn't have happened.

00:31:19.519 --> 00:31:23.519
Honey, we're just glad things didn't go any further than they did.

00:31:23.519 --> 00:31:28.519
I know, but I still feel awful about what did happen.

00:31:28.519 --> 00:31:30.519
And so do we.

00:31:30.519 --> 00:31:35.519
We got so wrapped up in our new jobs, the house,

00:31:35.519 --> 00:31:40.339
that we didn't even see what you were going through.

00:31:40.339 --> 00:31:43.339
Honey, we're going to do everything that we can to help you get through this.

00:31:43.339 --> 00:31:48.579
It's been a long day.

00:31:48.579 --> 00:31:52.579
Let's get some rest and we can talk about this tomorrow.

00:31:52.579 --> 00:32:00.559
Love you so much.

00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:06.940
My parents and later the elders were really there for me.

00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:18.109
The heart is more treacherous than anything else.

00:32:18.109 --> 00:32:22.109
I had heard that scripture a thousand times before,

00:32:22.109 --> 00:32:25.519
but never gave it much thought.

00:32:25.519 --> 00:32:27.519
Now I couldn't stop thinking about it.

00:32:27.519 --> 00:32:36.759
I wanted to be liked and accepted so much that I was willing to hide who I really was.

00:32:36.759 --> 00:32:41.619
I had to start setting things straight.

00:32:41.619 --> 00:32:43.619
It was so perfect.

00:32:43.619 --> 00:32:45.619
I mean, what was the problem?

00:32:45.619 --> 00:32:49.900
I know Mart practice is safe sex.

00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:52.900
Laurie couldn't believe that I turned Mart down.

00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:54.900
It's because...

00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:56.900
Because of what?

00:32:56.900 --> 00:32:58.900
Because of what I believe.

00:32:58.900 --> 00:33:00.900
I don't get it.

00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:02.900
I mean, it's my religious beliefs, Laurie.

00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:07.900
Look, Tara, I went through a lot of trouble to get you guys together.

00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:10.900
And now you've suddenly gotten religious?

00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:11.900
What's up with that?

00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:13.900
I haven't suddenly gotten religious.

00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:15.900
This is what I've always believed.

00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:20.900
I guess I just forgot who I really am and what I care about.

00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:22.900
Don't you care about Mark?

00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:26.900
I did, but I shouldn't have gotten involved with him.

00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:29.900
And I'm definitely not going to do something immoral with him.

00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:31.900
Who said do something immoral?

00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:33.900
I have morals.

00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:35.900
I'm not saying that you don't.

00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:38.900
Then what are you saying?

00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:42.900
That I don't believe in having sex before marriage.

00:33:42.900 --> 00:33:47.900
If it's with somebody that you really care about, what's the big deal?

00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:50.900
The big deal is that the Bible says it's wrong.

00:33:50.900 --> 00:33:55.900
Do you have to do every little thing the Bible says?

00:33:55.900 --> 00:33:59.900
Look, Laurie, I should have told you this before.

00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:03.900
I'm one of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:04.900
You are?

00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:05.900
Yes.

00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:07.900
And we take the Bible seriously.

00:34:07.900 --> 00:34:10.900
It says sex is for two people who are married.

00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:12.900
You're kidding, right?

00:34:12.900 --> 00:34:16.900
No, I'm not.

00:34:16.900 --> 00:34:19.900
Okay, so it didn't work out with you and Mark.

00:34:19.900 --> 00:34:21.900
But don't forget about the party Friday.

00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:23.900
Maybe you'll need somebody else.

00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:25.900
Somebody has more like you.

00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:26.900
No, Laurie.

00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:27.900
I don't think so.

00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:29.900
Not there.

00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:32.900
Well, then just come and hang out with us girls.

00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:36.900
Thanks, but I just wouldn't be comfortable at the party.

00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:37.900
Okay.

00:34:37.900 --> 00:34:41.900
So you don't want to date guys and you don't want to go to parties.

00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:43.900
Don't you people have any kind of fun?

00:34:43.900 --> 00:34:45.900
Of course we do.

00:34:45.900 --> 00:34:47.900
The Bible doesn't condemn fun.

00:34:47.900 --> 00:34:51.900
I would love to explain my beliefs.

00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:54.900
Maybe then all this would make more sense to you.

00:34:54.900 --> 00:34:58.900
I don't know, Tariots late.

00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:00.900
Maybe another time.

00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:03.900
Telling her all that was not easy.

00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:06.900
But it was worth it.

00:35:06.900 --> 00:35:09.900
I think that Laurie respected me for it.

00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:12.900
And it felt good to finally stand up for what I believed.

00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:19.300
I just wish that I had spoken up earlier.

00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:21.300
It would have saved me a lot of pain.

00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:41.380
It's me up as you can.

00:35:41.380 --> 00:36:44.590
Stacy, ever since I've moved here, you've been trying to be my friend.

00:36:44.590 --> 00:36:46.590
And I've acted so stupid.

00:36:46.590 --> 00:36:50.960
Why do you keep trying?

00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:54.300
Because I don't think you really like this.

00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:59.619
I think I'm looking at someone who's going through a hard time.

00:36:59.619 --> 00:37:01.619
And who really needs a friend.

00:37:01.619 --> 00:37:14.769
And I'd like to be that friend if you let me.

00:37:14.769 --> 00:37:18.849
You have been a friend, Stacy.

00:37:18.849 --> 00:37:20.849
Maybe even more than you know.

00:37:20.849 --> 00:37:32.380
I'll be okay.

00:37:32.380 --> 00:37:35.380
I realize now how much Jehovah cares.

00:37:35.380 --> 00:37:40.380
That I have my parents and friends like you to help me.

00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:44.739
You know what?

00:37:44.739 --> 00:37:45.739
Tomorrow?

00:37:45.739 --> 00:37:47.739
You and me.

00:37:47.739 --> 00:37:50.739
Let's go out and service and do lunch or something.

00:37:50.739 --> 00:37:51.739
Does that sound good?

00:37:51.739 --> 00:37:52.739
I like that.

00:37:52.739 --> 00:37:54.739
Good.

00:37:54.739 --> 00:37:59.739
As long as we don't go back to the Silver Spoon Diner, I can't.

00:37:59.739 --> 00:38:02.739
You mean the Greasey Spoon Diner.

00:38:02.739 --> 00:38:03.739
Oh.

00:38:03.739 --> 00:38:24.659
Chrissy, that was months ago.

00:38:24.659 --> 00:38:29.659
And I'm finally getting over things and feeling much better.

00:38:29.659 --> 00:38:32.659
I see things a lot differently now.

00:38:32.659 --> 00:38:38.659
I realize that being in the truth means more than just going to the kingdom hall with their parents.

00:38:38.659 --> 00:38:43.969
That we really do have to make the truth our own.

00:38:43.969 --> 00:38:52.739
Being with people who want to do the same thing can make a big difference.

00:38:52.739 --> 00:38:53.739
Oh, excellent.

00:38:53.739 --> 00:39:01.849
So how was service me this morning?

00:39:01.849 --> 00:39:06.849
At first, I didn't think I had anything in common with the friends of my congregation.

00:39:06.849 --> 00:39:08.849
But you know what?

00:39:08.849 --> 00:39:12.849
We have the most important thing in common we can have.

00:39:12.849 --> 00:39:14.849
Our friendship with Jehovah.

00:39:14.849 --> 00:39:19.960
Things are going great with my parents.

00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:21.960
I'm a lot more open with them now.

00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:27.420
And I let them know how I really feel.

00:39:27.420 --> 00:39:29.420
We've gotten a lot closer.

00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:37.739
I'm going to try and be a sport hero again.

00:39:37.739 --> 00:39:39.739
I tried like the last time.

00:39:39.739 --> 00:39:41.739
I opened the attraction for like a month.

00:39:41.739 --> 00:39:43.739
I heard that.

00:39:43.739 --> 00:39:45.739
It's kidding brother, that's it.

00:39:45.739 --> 00:39:51.739
Sometimes I used to think I was missing out because I couldn't do everything the kids had in school did.

00:39:51.739 --> 00:39:54.739
Now I think that they're the ones missing out.

00:39:54.739 --> 00:39:57.739
Maybe there are a lot of things that Christian can't do.

00:39:57.739 --> 00:40:01.739
But there's a lot of things we can do.

00:40:01.739 --> 00:40:04.739
The friends in our congregation get together all the time.

00:40:04.739 --> 00:40:08.739
I can't wait for you to meet them when you come out and visit.

00:40:08.739 --> 00:40:10.739
I hope that's soon.

00:40:10.739 --> 00:40:16.170
I wish I could go back and do things differently.

00:40:16.170 --> 00:40:18.170
But I can't change the past.

00:40:18.170 --> 00:40:22.170
I can only move forward and try to learn from my mistakes.

00:40:22.170 --> 00:40:27.929
You see, I've learned something very important.

00:40:27.929 --> 00:40:30.929
Something that I will never forget.

00:40:30.929 --> 00:40:33.929
Who my real friends are.

00:40:33.929 --> 00:40:38.929
And Chrissy, I hope that you will always be one of them.

00:40:38.929 --> 00:40:40.929
Forever.

00:40:40.929 --> 00:40:42.929
Love, Tara.

00:40:42.929 --> 00:41:14.750
We don't want to stick ourselves in a corner and just hide and refuse to talk to anyone because that's not balanced.

00:41:14.750 --> 00:41:17.750
There's nothing wrong with talking to the kids at school.

00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:21.750
We can be friendly with them because we're obviously going to have some of the same interests.

00:41:21.750 --> 00:41:24.750
But there's a certain line that we just won't cross.

00:41:24.750 --> 00:41:27.750
Kids that witness kids, they need to be honest with the kids at school.

00:41:27.750 --> 00:41:29.750
They need to let them know right away.

00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:30.750
You bring it up.

00:41:30.750 --> 00:41:32.750
You tell them what your beliefs are.

00:41:32.750 --> 00:41:35.750
You know, that your Jehovah's Witness, they're proud of what they are.

00:41:35.750 --> 00:41:41.750
Kids today need to recognize that there are good associates within the Christian congregation.

00:41:41.750 --> 00:41:46.750
They can have a great time and yet still live up to Bible standards and Bible principles.
