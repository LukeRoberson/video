00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:05.190
To begin, I'd like to share a personal experience with you.

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.689
When I was told that I was appointed to be a member of the governing body,

00:00:10.689 --> 00:00:13.689
one of the brothers who informed me said,

00:00:13.689 --> 00:00:15.689
with this assignment,

00:00:15.689 --> 00:00:19.690
you'll experience a great increase in responsibility,

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:25.690
but you'll also see a corresponding increase in Jehovah's Spirit to help you.

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:28.690
It will not be too much for you.

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:33.689
Well, those words were very, very reassuring to me.

00:00:33.689 --> 00:00:39.689
And the fact is that all of us, no matter who we are serving Jehovah faithfully,

00:00:39.689 --> 00:00:44.689
we must rely on His help to succeed in serving Him.

00:00:44.689 --> 00:00:48.689
Now, how do we show this and receive His help?

00:00:48.689 --> 00:00:52.689
There are a number of ways we're going to focus on three of them.

00:00:52.689 --> 00:00:58.689
They are follow direction, show faith, and use common sense,

00:00:58.689 --> 00:01:02.689
or the thinking ability that Jehovah has given to us.

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:05.689
So let's consider the first step.

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:13.689
Sometimes all that's required to receive Jehovah's blessing on our work is to follow a simple, clear direction.

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:15.689
Now, here's a Bible example of that.

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.689
It's found in Mark chapter 14.

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.689
Mark chapter 14.

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:27.689
Now, you'll recall from this account that God's son directed two of his disciples to go into Jerusalem

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.689
and to prepare a large furnished upper room for the Passover.

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:34.689
His directions were specific.

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:39.689
For instance, Jesus said that they would meet a man carrying a large,

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.689
by not earthenware jar, and they were to follow Him.

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:47.689
And then starting in verse 14, Jesus added this.

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.689
He said, wherever He goes inside, say to the master of the house,

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:58.689
the teacher says, where is the guest room where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:03.689
And He will show you a large upper room furnished and ready, prepared for us there.

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:09.689
So the disciples went out, and they entered the city and founded just as He said to them,

00:02:09.689 --> 00:02:13.689
and they prepared for the Passover.

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:17.689
So the directions were simple, right?

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:22.689
They were told where they should go, who they should follow, what they were to say,

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:24.689
and what they were to do.

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:27.689
And the two disciples promptly followed that direction.

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:32.689
And of course, their obedience brought many blessings, as we know.

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:36.689
Well, what practical lesson can you draw from this?

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:42.689
The lesson that sometimes all that is needed in serving Jehovah is to follow simple, clear direction.

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:47.689
You'll have many opportunities to do so in your assignments.

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:53.689
Follow clear direction, and look for Jehovah's blessing on it.

00:02:53.689 --> 00:02:59.689
But now, in the other hand, you might be asked to care for something that's far more involved than that.

00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:07.689
For example, what if you're asked to assist someone who's known to be difficult to deal with?

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:14.689
Or you're asked to care for a work-related problem that others have not been able to solve?

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:18.689
You're the one selected, because you've had the training.

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:21.689
In such a case, what will help you?

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:24.689
Your strong faith, the next step.

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:29.689
The fact is that at times we need to show added faith to fulfill our assignments, true?

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:31.689
Consider the example of Ananias.

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:33.689
Now, he too was a man of faith.

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:39.689
But he faced a challenge that required even more of him, and we read about it in Acts chapter 9.

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:41.689
We'll begin with verse 10.

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:44.689
Acts chapter 9, verse 10.

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:50.689
It says, there was a disciple named Ananias and Damascus, and the Lord said to him in a vision, Ananias.

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:53.689
He said, here I am, Lord.

00:03:53.689 --> 00:04:02.689
The Lord said to him, get up, go to the street, call straight, and look for a man named Saul from Tarsus at the house of Judas.

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:04.689
For look, he is praying.

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:11.689
And in a vision, he has seen a man named Ananias come in and lay his hands on him so that he may recover sight.

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:21.689
But Ananias answered, Lord, I've heard about many about all the harm he did to your holy ones in Jerusalem.

00:04:21.689 --> 00:04:27.689
And here he has authority from the chief priest to arrest all those calling on your name.

00:04:27.689 --> 00:04:37.689
But the Lord said to him, go, because this man is a chosen vessel to me to bear my name to the nations, as well as to kings and the sons of Israel.

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:43.689
For I will show him plainly how many things he must suffer for my name.

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:46.689
Well, the direction was clear.

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:50.689
Where should Ananias go to the street called straight?

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:53.689
Who was he looking for? A man named Saul.

00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:56.689
What house is he in? The house of Judas.

00:04:56.689 --> 00:05:01.689
Ananias was even told what Saul was doing. He is praying.

00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:04.689
Then Ananias was told what he should do.

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:09.689
He was to lay his hands on him so that he would recover sight.

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:12.689
Simple, right? Jesus would do the rest.

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:16.689
What a great example of giving clear direction.

00:05:16.689 --> 00:05:20.689
But here is where Ananias needed to stir up more faith.

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:25.689
The man he was to visit had severely persecuted the holy ones in Jerusalem.

00:05:25.689 --> 00:05:35.689
And speaking to the Lord, Ananias added that this man quote has authority from the chief priest to arrest all those calling on your name.

00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:39.689
Well, talk about stating the obvious to Jesus.

00:05:39.689 --> 00:05:46.689
The point is that Ananias had a moment where he was overwhelmed by the way to the assignment. That's just what happened.

00:05:46.689 --> 00:05:49.689
What would help him? More faith.

00:05:49.689 --> 00:05:52.689
And Jesus knew how to draw it up in that dear man.

00:05:52.689 --> 00:05:57.689
Look again at Jesus' reply. He simply restated his command, go.

00:05:57.689 --> 00:06:07.689
Then Jesus said that this man is a chosen vessel to me, to bear my name to the nations, as well as to kings and the sons of Israel.

00:06:07.689 --> 00:06:11.689
Now, Jesus added something there, didn't he?

00:06:11.689 --> 00:06:15.689
He pointed to the future. What was he doing?

00:06:15.689 --> 00:06:19.689
He was helping Ananias to look ahead.

00:06:19.689 --> 00:06:25.689
And doing this evidently prompted Ananias to show even more faith, which is what he needed.

00:06:25.689 --> 00:06:27.689
How do we know this?

00:06:27.689 --> 00:06:29.689
Well, look at what he said to Saul.

00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:35.689
On meeting Saul, in verse 17 tells us that Ananias called him brother.

00:06:35.689 --> 00:06:42.689
His initial hesitation had changed into putting his full faith and trust in Jesus' direction.

00:06:42.689 --> 00:06:48.689
Well, like Ananias, as you face challenges in the future and they will come, they come upon all of us.

00:06:48.689 --> 00:06:52.689
Have strong faith that Jehovah sees what is needed.

00:06:52.689 --> 00:06:56.689
And he and his dear son will help you.

00:06:56.689 --> 00:06:58.689
Keep the big picture in mind.

00:06:58.689 --> 00:07:01.689
And look to the blessings ahead for your hard work.

00:07:01.689 --> 00:07:06.689
Jehovah will always bless your strong faith in him.

00:07:06.689 --> 00:07:12.689
Well, so far we've looked at the need to follow clear direction and to show strong faith.

00:07:12.689 --> 00:07:14.689
Now we're going to add another step.

00:07:14.689 --> 00:07:17.689
Use common sense or thinking ability.

00:07:17.689 --> 00:07:20.689
Our Bible example, Elijah.

00:07:20.689 --> 00:07:26.689
In this account, Elijah has traveled to Zaratheth, a Phoenician coastal town.

00:07:26.689 --> 00:07:28.689
What was his business there?

00:07:28.689 --> 00:07:31.689
Well, the lamb was in the grip of a long drought.

00:07:31.689 --> 00:07:36.689
And Jehovah would help his prophet by means of someone in that town.

00:07:36.689 --> 00:07:42.689
Elijah was told, look, I will command a widow there to supply you with food.

00:07:42.689 --> 00:07:46.689
It appears that he gave no other details about the widow than that.

00:07:46.689 --> 00:07:49.689
So how would Elijah find her?

00:07:49.689 --> 00:07:53.689
Would Elijah look for the wealthiest widow to care for his needs?

00:07:53.689 --> 00:07:58.689
Or would he use common sense and thinking ability along with his faith?

00:07:58.689 --> 00:08:04.689
Let's see what Elijah does at first King's chapter 17.

00:08:04.689 --> 00:08:06.689
And we're going to read verse 10.

00:08:06.689 --> 00:08:12.689
First King's 1710, it says, so he Elijah rose up and went to Zaratheth.

00:08:12.689 --> 00:08:18.689
When he came to the entrance of the city, there was a widow gathering pieces of wood.

00:08:18.689 --> 00:08:25.689
So he called to her and said, please, bring me a little water and a cup so that I may drink.

00:08:26.689 --> 00:08:29.689
So then what did Elijah do?

00:08:29.689 --> 00:08:33.690
Evidently, he approached the very first widow he met.

00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:37.690
And she was not a wealthy widow, but a poor one.

00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:42.690
In fact, it says Elijah had not yet passed beyond the entrance of the city.

00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:45.690
What does this tell us about Elijah?

00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:51.690
First, he showed no prejudice and following through on Jehovah's direction, did he?

00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:57.690
And second, he added thinking ability to his obedience and faith.

00:08:57.690 --> 00:08:58.690
How so?

00:08:58.690 --> 00:09:06.690
Well, common sense would tell him to show his faith and start looking with the very first widow he met.

00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:12.690
Elijah obviously had confidence that Jehovah would make his choice clear.

00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:18.690
His obedience, faith, and good sense were rewarded because that widow was Jehovah's choice.

00:09:19.690 --> 00:09:25.690
Now, surely Holy Spirit guided Elijah, but we can't ignore the faith and clear thinking ability

00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:31.690
that Elijah developed as he obediently did God's will after all prior to that widow,

00:09:31.690 --> 00:09:35.690
Jehovah used birds to carry food to his prophet.

00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:39.690
Surely, Jehovah could use a poor widow as well.

00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:42.690
What's the lesson for you and for all of us?

00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:47.690
Sometimes we're given much to go on when we receive an assignment.

00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:51.690
At other times, frankly, maybe not so much.

00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:57.690
In such a case, our faith and clear thinking ability reminds us to trust in Jehovah

00:09:57.690 --> 00:10:02.690
and to look for his guidance as we go forward in doing his will.

00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:07.690
Jehovah will always help you dear friends at the right time.

00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:12.690
So then as our example show promptly obey, show strong faith,

00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:19.690
and use common sense and thinking ability in our service to our dear Heavenly Father.

00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:26.690
Remembering such lessons will help you as you support Jehovah's work in your respective branches.

00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:32.690
Jehovah gives power beyond what is normal to those who rely on him

00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:35.690
and who follow the steps that lead to blessings.

00:10:35.690 --> 00:10:39.690
And we are confident that this will always be true of you.
