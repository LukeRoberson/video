00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:21.940
In Matthew chapter 24, Jesus gave his disciples a composite sign of his presence, a sign that

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:29.620
included tragedies and fearful sites on a grand scale. Jesus' words reflect his sense of urgency

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:36.899
and motivates his disciples to do his verse 42 states, keep on the watch. Jesus also foretold a

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.820
worldwide effort to spread good news. The critical times we live in will not last forever.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:51.060
With this in mind, the homepage of JW.org specifically, the advertisement at the top,

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:57.460
known as the Billboard, highlights trends and events which clearly demonstrate that we live

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:04.340
in the last days. You may wonder, how are articles chosen? How do they reach the front page so

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:10.340
quickly while maintaining our high standard for publication? And what effect do these articles have

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:16.900
on our website visitors? Let's have a look. So we've established a group of brothers that

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:23.140
be twice a week made up of representatives from the coordinators committee and the writing committee.

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:29.700
Now, when these brothers come together, they're looking for major events. So it could be things like

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:37.700
the war in Ukraine, the shooting that took place at a school in Texas. But it also could include surveys

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.700
or studies that have recently been published. Some examples are the World Health Organization

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.980
commenting on this epidemic of loneliness that people are seeing all over the world,

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:54.659
as well as the terrible problem that young people are having with mental illness after the

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:02.180
pandemic. Now, in all of these stories, we're looking to try to point to what does the Bible have to

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:07.939
say? Or how do these stories illustrate where we're living in terms of the last days?

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:14.740
When we find the right story, not only does it help honest-hearted people, but it helps our brothers

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:21.539
when they're in the ministry to be able to have fresh, current topics that they can use to start

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:29.780
conversations with people that they meet. Once the newsworthy item is chosen, careful collaboration,

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:37.060
a streamlined workflow, and Jehovah's blessing. Keep us on time. Let's follow an article from the

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:43.699
category, Keep on the Watch. The writing committee asked for high quality articles within a few days

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:50.099
or even within one day. At the time they asked us our quickest process for a website article was

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:56.740
about two months long, so one day seemed to be impossible. As soon as the writing department

00:02:57.379 --> 00:03:04.419
is given a topic to develop immediately, work begins. Research and writing of the article,

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:10.819
proofreading, fact checking. Final approval is given to the article and then translation begins

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:17.780
so that it can be posted in dozens of languages on the website. These steps speed up article production,

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:25.379
but we keep looking for ways to reduce the time even further. So once an initial draft is produced,

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:31.379
several teams use collaboration software to work on the document at the same time.

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:36.419
Notes are provided for translators, statements are checked for accuracy,

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:42.099
and information is added to make the article easy to find through internet search engines.

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:46.900
Preliminary artwork gives us an idea of what the final product will look like.

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:53.379
For people who would normally do their steps in sequence one after another separately,

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:57.060
now they had to all work on the article together at the same time.

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:05.780
Each statement of fact we publish needs to come from a trustworthy source. We want our application

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:13.300
of scripture to be correct. We need to be correct in how we describe events, how we list people's

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:19.300
names, how we list titles, so we carefully check all of that to publish accurate information.

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:26.420
With our billboard articles, the standard for accuracy is the same. The work of research and

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:32.500
checking is the same. What's unique to the billboard articles is the click turnaround.

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:37.860
At that point the art department's job is to find an image that will be visually appealing

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.819
and also an image that will hopefully reach the hearts of our viewers. We may have about an hour

00:04:42.819 --> 00:04:48.660
and a half to select an image, we'll collect roughly 15 to 20 images and put that in a package

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:54.180
that then the brothers will approve. Once they select a final image, we then will produce something

00:04:54.180 --> 00:05:00.019
called a digital image layout that provides all the details that everybody else will need to produce

00:05:00.019 --> 00:05:06.339
the article. So our various images will work for different devices including our laptops, tablets,

00:05:06.339 --> 00:05:13.300
and mobile phones. Translators work hard to ensure that the majority of our internet visitors

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:18.339
can read the billboard article in their own language at the same time it is posted in

00:05:18.339 --> 00:05:23.939
English. Well, we've prioritized the billboard articles because we know they have to be turned

00:05:23.939 --> 00:05:30.019
around quickly and the translators need background information about those articles in order to

00:05:30.019 --> 00:05:36.420
translate them accurately. So we provide that ahead of time but within one day of receiving it

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:43.620
in our department. What strikes me about our experience with this is that any message of a once

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:49.459
to get out to all the nations that can be done very rapidly. And what effect do these articles

00:05:49.459 --> 00:06:22.160
have on our website visitors? After hearing about the tragedy, the school shooting, the branch

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:28.560
committee started discussing how to support the friends. So they decided to send three couples

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:36.560
to strengthen the congregations. When we showed up, we realized how the people in the community

00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:44.000
were very overwhelmed. They were hurt. They were angry. And the friends were also crushed

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.600
emotionally. They needed comfort as well. So they were trying to get over their feelings of hurt.

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:53.680
But at the same time, they realized they need to preach. They need to encourage others.

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:59.279
But there was a question how to go about it. And we learned that really the focus is to listen

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:06.959
to comfort and then the beautiful billboard that came. You can even see the friends in the ministry

00:07:06.959 --> 00:07:12.319
and they were showing their cell phone. We could use this beautiful gift, the billboard,

00:07:12.319 --> 00:07:17.920
to help people see you're on the minds of millions of people. You're being thought of, you're being

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:24.639
prayed for. The billboard, we both feel touched their hearts, the friends, because it wasn't just for

00:07:24.639 --> 00:07:31.360
the ministry, but it comforted and reassured our brothers and sisters that they're not alone.

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:37.279
That Jehovah's organization has alerted to what's going on. And with good cooperation,

00:07:37.279 --> 00:07:41.360
these things develop and are produced so quickly, which was amazing to all of us.

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:50.160
In Luke chapter 13, Jesus used current events to teach scriptural truths. Could you use these

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:53.839
up-to-date billboard articles to direct a conversation toward God's kingdom?

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:58.399
Sharing an article electronically takes just a few simple steps.

00:07:59.439 --> 00:08:03.680
Scroll to the bottom of the article that you want to send to find the share feature.

00:08:04.879 --> 00:08:07.759
If you want to learn more about sharing links to articles,

00:08:07.759 --> 00:08:13.439
why not practice with a friend? And if a recent billboard article has been replaced,

00:08:13.439 --> 00:08:19.680
don't worry, you can still find it. Simply go to the See More link to find a list of the latest

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:26.319
homepage articles. When Jesus gave the composite sign of his presence, he followed with this

00:08:26.319 --> 00:08:32.879
stirring encouragement. When you see these things happening, know that the kingdom of God is near.

00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:39.200
The purpose of featuring these events is not to highlight how bad life is now,

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:46.240
but instead to show that soon God's kingdom will make life better. We need to keep this in mind.

00:08:46.799 --> 00:08:53.360
Our loved ones and neighbors need to know this as well. How thankful we are that Jehovah

00:08:53.360 --> 00:09:00.559
through his organization alerts all of us to keep on the watch and he provides the tools we need

00:09:00.559 --> 00:09:09.600
to reach hearts as the end draws near.
