00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:18.620
Where do you begin an important project, like the story of Josiah, love Jehovah, hate what is bad?

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.899
You begin with prayerful consideration.

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.820
It's a serious responsibility, part of being loyal to Jehovah and his word.

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:31.739
Therefore, many hours of careful research goes into the first step,

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.380
writing a script.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.780
The script is then visualized through a step called storyboarding,

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.200
but it's not just the script and storyboarding that requires attention to accuracy.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:54.240
Costumes must be thoroughly researched so that their components, styles, colors,

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.240
and even the types of fabrics appear as historically accurate as possible.

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.489
The production must also accurately depict the times being represented

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.810
while making the best use of donated funds.

00:01:08.849 --> 00:01:09.730
How can this be done?

00:01:10.769 --> 00:01:14.849
For the story of Josiah, the solution was to film at Bethel locations.

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:17.890
Such as the studio spaces at Mount Ebo.

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.450
Set construction began early in 2018.

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:26.530
The production team designed and built three flexible sets,

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.170
so that with easy prop adjustments, they could be in multiple locations.

00:01:34.379 --> 00:01:38.060
Even the exterior Jerusalem city scenes were filmed indoors.

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:51.090
Many brothers and sisters from local congregations served as extras for the crowd scenes.

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.209
With an eye to biblical and historical accuracy,

00:01:56.209 --> 00:02:00.530
the makeup team transformed the actors into characters from King Josiah's time.

00:02:02.129 --> 00:02:04.609
There were so many details to get right.

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:35.060
For a large portion of the drama, filming in front of a green screen enabled the visual

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.740
effects team to construct accurate environments digitally.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.120
Many layers of character action, called plates, were assembled with digital environments

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.879
to produce complex visuals.

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:20.030
For the closing festival scene, which required 14,000 Israelites,

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:26.909
and many sheep, 3D models were made and duplicated to simulate the large crowd.

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:36.830
In July 2018, the production packed up and moved to an outdoor location

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:39.310
at Watchtower Farms in Wauk Hill, New York.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.719
In August, the last scene was filmed back to the Mount Ebo studio.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:06.639
After 45 days of filming and with over four terabytes of footage captured,

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.120
the team had finished production.

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.240
The project moved to the editing facilities at Patterson, New York.

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.740
But what more could be done so the account betrayed could touch our hearts.

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.970
A colorist applied a look to the overall film to enhance the picture's quality and mood.

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:38.339
Additional sound effects, such as footsteps and sound of dry grasping rustled,

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:42.980
or recorded to make the on-screen action more natural and compelling.

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:48.100
Finally, the musical soundtrack was composed, recorded,

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.300
and added to the movie to enhance the appeal to our hearts.

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:56.850
The work on the story of Josiah loved Jehovah,

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:01.329
Heatwood is bad, was done to strengthen Jehovah's people worldwide.

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.810
You're not alone. Jehovah is with you.

00:05:06.769 --> 00:05:14.529
This powerful story also assists parents as they teach their children the power of God's word and promise.

00:05:16.689 --> 00:05:20.370
These words that I'm commanding you today must be on your heart.

00:05:21.329 --> 00:05:25.410
And you must inculcate them and your sons and speak of them when you sit in your house.

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:30.610
And when you walk on the road and when you lie down and when you get up.

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:36.800
So that it may always go well with you and your sons after you.

00:05:37.839 --> 00:05:43.519
Because you are doing what is good and right in the eyes of Jehovah, you are God.

00:05:45.519 --> 00:05:52.160
The story of Josiah has proven to be yet another example of how Jehovah continues to provide

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:56.959
a button spiritual food and support for his people worldwide.
