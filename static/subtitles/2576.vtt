00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.270
Once the lights went out, the winds came in,

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.270
hear people yelling and screaming,

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.270
and it was just terrifying.

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.270
All the time I was standing at the door

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.270
and I seen a hundred foot piece of the boardwalk

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.270
going flying down the block with cars falling.

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.270
I can't believe that's 30 feet away from me.

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.270
Oh, it was like a war zone.

00:00:53.270 --> 00:01:00.820
Fire is burning in some areas.

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.819
My house got about three and a half to four feet of water.

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:12.180
Everything that we own is out sitting at a front yard.

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.180
Basically, the whole rock away has been devastated by this hurricane.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:40.689
The hurricane is right now off the coast.

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:42.689
It hasn't arrived yet.

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.689
It's a late season storm.

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:47.689
We weren't really expecting something like this.

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:51.689
It's going to have an impact because it's combining with another storm.

00:01:51.689 --> 00:02:05.480
And the forecasters are saying that this is going to be one of the worst storms we've had in a while.

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.479
Just before the disaster hit, there was a message

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.479
that went out through the circuit overseers to all the bodies of elders.

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:18.479
There's 26,000 volunteers waiting to come in to the New York Metro area.

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:22.479
We didn't even have to put a call out when they lined up.

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:27.479
We're getting calls in no specific order from the whole greater New York area.

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:31.479
So we're trying to bring a man geographically.

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:34.479
We want our crews to be sympathetic.

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:37.479
So if they get there and need at that point in time

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:41.479
because to help that deer sister sort of through her belongings,

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:43.479
you came off your work belt,

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:47.479
put on a smile, get your armor around there and say prayer with her,

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:49.479
help her sort of stuff out.

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:59.159
The challenge is when we have a disaster,

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:01.159
it's overwhelming for everyone.

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:04.159
The regional building committee that's local, the elders locally,

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:05.159
so they need assistance.

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:07.159
Now what will these volunteers work?

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:15.990
Just to help move some strong brothers like you guys.

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:19.990
If you look to the fence over there, the water was over the fence.

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:22.990
Everything is being taken out in my home.

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:26.990
What's wet is on one side, what's dry is on one side.

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:29.990
There have been very, very protective of certain things.

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:34.990
I hear them shouting fragile on one end, you know, delicate on one end.

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:37.990
The brothers have been wonderful.

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:39.990
They've been here from the very beginning.

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:42.990
They came to check everything.

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:46.990
Our whole organization will be working very diligently

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:50.990
to try to take care of the needs of our brothers and sisters,

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:52.990
both physically and spiritually.

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:58.340
You know, as we flew over the disaster area, we saw today.

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.340
I was really touched.

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.340
My heart was bleeding for the people that we saw.

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:20.209
As you're going through, you realize the magnitude of this disaster.

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:27.290
We just happy that we were able to escape with our lives in this tragedy.

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:32.290
Immediately after this storm had passed,

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:37.290
the brothers were trying to reach out to us, trying to find out how we were doing.

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:40.290
When you have a significant event like this storm,

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:44.290
of course you want to provide all that you can on a material level.

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:49.290
But spiritually, we have to help one another in that way.

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:52.290
And that's so important, we cannot neglect that.

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:56.290
It's a brotherhood, you know, you feel that they care.

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:59.290
And they really want it to concern about it welfare.

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:02.290
As soon as we see it, when the parker he came by

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:05.290
and he read his description, he prayed.

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:10.980
All the families in Naraka ways that are affected by this day

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:14.980
are also appreciative of what's being done by the organization.

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:19.980
We're still overwhelmed in days

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:22.980
that I don't think we've come out of that days period of what hit us.

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:27.819
Bad rooms.

00:05:27.819 --> 00:05:30.819
There were a lot of friends in our congregation

00:05:30.819 --> 00:05:34.819
that were very close to that were affected along with our family.

00:05:34.819 --> 00:05:37.819
We had our meeting on Sunday for the congregation.

00:05:37.819 --> 00:05:41.819
And when we got there, there was such a spirit of love and unity

00:05:41.819 --> 00:05:45.819
and you just felt like this is your whole organization.

00:05:45.819 --> 00:05:50.819
I would say if you've never been through a disaster before,

00:05:50.819 --> 00:05:53.819
don't worry, the whole world will take care of you.

00:05:53.819 --> 00:06:06.839
All of a sudden I get a phone call saying,

00:06:06.839 --> 00:06:09.839
we're going to send some friends over to help you out.

00:06:09.839 --> 00:06:13.839
And little did I realize it was going to be this many

00:06:13.839 --> 00:06:15.839
with so tremendous amount of help.

00:06:15.839 --> 00:06:17.839
It's overwhelming to see.

00:06:17.839 --> 00:06:21.839
Being a part of your organization means that you have friends

00:06:21.839 --> 00:06:23.839
and extended family.

00:06:23.839 --> 00:06:25.839
When things like this happen,

00:06:25.839 --> 00:06:27.839
even if they have never met you before,

00:06:27.839 --> 00:06:29.839
they're coming and they're helping

00:06:29.839 --> 00:06:31.839
and that's exactly what happened here.

00:06:31.839 --> 00:06:33.839
I met friends at my house picking up my floor.

00:06:33.839 --> 00:06:39.839
I met friends at my house carrying out bags full of wet insulation.

00:06:39.839 --> 00:06:46.839
And to see this come to place right before my eyes is a very faith strengthening.

00:06:46.839 --> 00:06:51.839
Even in these times we can find something to be joyful about.

00:06:51.839 --> 00:06:55.839
The friends coming together so closely and just really showing

00:06:55.839 --> 00:06:58.839
each other the true love that is described in the Bible.

00:06:58.839 --> 00:07:01.839
Yes, we've lost a lot of things but we've not lost that.

00:07:01.839 --> 00:07:04.839
We've not lost the brotherhood of each other, God has given to us.

00:07:04.839 --> 00:07:07.839
I experienced the biggest disaster of my life

00:07:07.839 --> 00:07:12.839
and Jehovah comforted me through his organization.

00:07:12.839 --> 00:07:19.110
The friends just came and just swallowed us with love.

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:25.060
I just can't find that out anywhere.

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:27.060
That's priceless.

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:29.060
That really is.
