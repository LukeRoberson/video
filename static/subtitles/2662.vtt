00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:18.670
I think a lot of it has to do with the media or young boys my age and younger are really

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:23.870
obsessed with what they look like and to be honest I'm one of them.

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:33.070
I've known people that are obsessed with their body whether it's male or female in terms of

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:40.509
dieting or working out more. They look at magazines and they want that body.

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:48.539
When they see the way that these people are betrayed and they see this information from the media

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:59.170
they begin to feel even worse about themselves than they may already feel. We get so focused on

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:06.129
our imperfections sometimes that it's hard to see past those and see the things that are beautiful about us.

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.569
When someone looks at a treasure chest they don't say oh the treasure chest is dirty and old in the

00:01:11.569 --> 00:01:15.250
outside they want to know what's inside of it. That's what counts.

00:01:16.769 --> 00:01:21.890
Really all are beautiful and we all have beautiful things about us whether it's internally or

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.810
externally sometimes we just need help seeing those things.
