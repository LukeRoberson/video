00:00:01.679 --> 00:00:04.679
Welcome to JW Broadcasting.

00:00:04.679 --> 00:00:09.679
As Jehovah's Witnesses, we consider the Bible a marvelous gift

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:11.679
from our Heavenly Father.

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:16.679
In the next hour, we'll deepen our appreciation for this gift.

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:19.679
We'll learn how Jehovah expresses his love through it

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:23.679
and how countless individuals preserved its message.

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:26.679
We'll learn how the Bible was written down

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:30.679
long before modern printing techniques were invented.

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:33.679
Knowing God's name is a privilege.

00:00:33.679 --> 00:00:35.679
A humble man felt similarly,

00:00:35.679 --> 00:00:38.679
which moved him to produce the first English Bible

00:00:38.679 --> 00:00:42.679
to consistently use Jehovah's name.

00:00:42.679 --> 00:00:46.679
And in our latest installment of Truth Transforms Lives,

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:49.679
we'll learn how Bible promises led a deaf man

00:00:49.679 --> 00:00:53.679
who was an orphan to find his Heavenly Father

00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:56.679
and spiritual family.

00:00:56.679 --> 00:00:59.679
This is JW Broadcasting.

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:21.299
Imagine you just learned that you had received

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.299
an amazing inheritance,

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:26.299
something very special that had been in your family

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:28.299
for many years,

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:30.299
and the gift is very valuable.

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.299
How would you feel?

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:34.299
Actually, all of us,

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:36.299
everyone listening to this program

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.299
have received such an inheritance.

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.299
It's something that's been passed down

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:45.299
from generation to generation for thousands of years.

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.299
What is it?

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:51.299
It's God's Word, the Bible.

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.299
Through this precious gift,

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:58.299
we feel Jehovah's love in what ways?

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:00.299
Let's consider three.

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.299
We feel it when we learn how Jehovah has preserved his Word

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:09.300
for thousands of years so that we'd have it today.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.300
We feel it in the message it conveys

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.300
from our loving Heavenly Father.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.300
And we feel it when we see how our lives are improved

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.300
when we apply its teachings.

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.300
Let's talk about the first.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:30.300
Jehovah's love is felt in the way that he preserved his Word.

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:35.300
The Bible was written so long ago on perishable materials

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.300
and yet we have it today.

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.300
We have it on our phones and tablets

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.300
and we have printed copies.

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.300
Consider what a miracle it is

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.300
that Jehovah had the Bible written down,

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.300
hand copied for centuries,

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.300
and yet it was accurately preserved until our day.

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.300
How was the Bible written?

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.300
In a miraculous way.

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.300
2 Timothy chapter 3 and verse 16 clearly states,

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:11.300
all scripture is inspired of God and beneficial.

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.300
Yes, Jehovah used his Holy Spirit to convey his thoughts

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.300
to the minds and hearts of faithful men.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.300
Some 40 writers were used.

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:28.300
1600 years passed until the Bible was completed

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.300
in about the year 98 CE.

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:36.300
That's more than 1,900 years ago.

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:40.300
So how is it that we have the Bible today?

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.300
It had to be hand copied.

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.300
Through the centuries, scribes made copies of the text.

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:50.300
For example, the Maserites,

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.300
a group of meticulous Jewish scholars and copyists

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:58.300
literally counted the number of words

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.300
and even the number of letters.

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.300
Why?

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:06.300
To make sure that they copied the text accurately,

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:10.300
they wanted no errors to be introduced.

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:14.300
Thankfully, many ancient Bible manuscripts

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.300
have survived until today,

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:20.300
perhaps some 6,000 manuscripts of the Hebrew scriptures

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:25.300
and some 5,000 of the Christian Greek scriptures.

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.300
By the 15th century,

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.300
the Bible had been hand copied for hundreds of years,

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.300
but now that was about to change.

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.300
Let me show you what happened using a few examples

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:43.300
from our Bible collection in Warwick, New York.

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.300
This is what's often called a Paris Bible.

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.300
It was completed in France during the latter part

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.300
of the 13th century,

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:56.300
that is somewhere between the years 1250 and 1300.

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:00.300
It's a complete Bible copied by hand.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.300
Look at how beautiful it is.

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.300
Imagine the work involved,

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.300
a scribe sitting at a table,

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.300
day after day carefully copying

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:15.300
so that someone could have a Bible like this.

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:19.300
Of course, few people would ever have been able to own

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:23.300
a precious hand copied Bible like this one.

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:26.300
But Jehovah had something better in mind.

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:29.300
So in the 15th century,

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.300
a man named Johannes Gutenberg came up

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.300
with an amazing idea.

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.300
In about the year 1455,

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.300
Gutenberg produced the first printed Bible.

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:45.300
He printed only about 180 copies.

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:48.300
That doesn't sound like a lot today, does it?

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.300
But remember,

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.300
up until that time,

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:55.300
every Bible had been hand copied.

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:58.300
So this was something truly amazing.

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:01.300
Here's an original page

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:06.300
from one of those 180 Bibles printed by Gutenberg.

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.300
It's beautiful, isn't it?

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:11.300
But this was just the beginning.

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:14.300
In time, Gutenberg's invention

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:17.300
would allow for thousands of copies of the Bible

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:21.300
to be printed in a relatively short period of time.

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:23.300
In the years that followed,

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:26.300
printing presses gradually were set up

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:28.300
in various cities in Europe.

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:31.300
What were they able to produce?

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:34.300
In 1475,

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:37.300
Bernard Rieshel produced this Bible

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:39.300
in Basel, Switzerland.

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:41.300
Look at the size of it

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:44.300
and look at the beautiful printing.

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:49.300
It's amazing what those early printers were able to produce.

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:52.300
Although the Bible was now being printed,

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:54.300
there was still a problem.

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:55.300
What was it?

00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:01.300
Few people would ever have been able to afford a Bible like this.

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:03.300
Even though it was printed,

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:06.300
it was still very expensive.

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:09.300
This Bible was probably produced for a church,

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:13.300
or for someone who was very wealthy.

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:15.300
But less than 20 years later,

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:19.300
there was another exciting development.

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:22.300
This is the Biblia Integra,

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:25.300
often called the Poor Man's Bible.

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:30.300
It was printed in Switzerland in the year 1491.

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:32.300
What do you notice about it?

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:34.300
It's very small.

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:39.300
It's thought to be the first small-sized printed Bible.

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:42.300
The man who produced this Bible had a new idea.

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:47.300
He produced this Bible to appeal to common churchgoers.

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:51.300
It wasn't a Bible for a library or a church.

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:53.300
It was for personal use,

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:55.300
something that a person could own

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:59.300
and carry with him and read at any time.

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:03.300
Why was this development so important?

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:05.300
Because in the next few decades,

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:07.300
the Bible would be translated

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:09.300
from the original languages

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:11.300
and printed in the vernacular

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:15.300
or common languages of people across Europe.

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:17.300
For the first time,

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:19.300
it would be possible for people

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:24.300
to have a personal copy of the Bible in their own language.

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:29.300
These significant developments in Bible production

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:34.299
give us reason to believe that our loving father, Jehovah, was involved.

00:08:34.299 --> 00:08:37.299
He not only had preserved the Bible,

00:08:37.299 --> 00:08:41.299
but now he was ensuring that his gift

00:08:41.299 --> 00:08:45.299
would be made available to all people.

00:08:45.299 --> 00:08:47.299
Now, let's return to the studio.

00:08:47.299 --> 00:08:53.129
Of course, God's enemies did not want people

00:08:53.129 --> 00:08:55.129
to have Jehovah's precious gift.

00:08:55.129 --> 00:09:00.129
Thus, it's not surprising that many people have actively worked

00:09:00.129 --> 00:09:03.129
to prevent others from having the Bible.

00:09:03.129 --> 00:09:07.129
One scholar, Albert Barnes, described it this way.

00:09:07.129 --> 00:09:12.129
No book has excited so much opposition as this.

00:09:12.129 --> 00:09:15.129
But it has survived every attack

00:09:15.129 --> 00:09:20.129
which power, talent, and eloquence have ever made on it.

00:09:20.129 --> 00:09:26.129
No army ever survived so many battles as the Bible.

00:09:26.129 --> 00:09:30.129
Humans alone could never have preserved the Bible

00:09:30.129 --> 00:09:33.129
in the face of such strong opposition.

00:09:33.129 --> 00:09:37.129
It's a miracle that we have it today.

00:09:37.129 --> 00:09:41.129
Clearly, we feel the love of Jehovah

00:09:41.129 --> 00:09:43.129
when we see how he's preserved the Bible

00:09:43.129 --> 00:09:48.129
and made this precious gift available to all.

00:09:48.129 --> 00:09:51.129
The Bible's message is a second way

00:09:51.129 --> 00:09:53.129
that we feel Jehovah's love.

00:09:53.129 --> 00:09:57.129
The Bible teaches us things that we cannot learn anywhere else.

00:09:57.129 --> 00:10:01.129
True, without the Bible, we could understand

00:10:01.129 --> 00:10:03.129
that there is a creator,

00:10:03.129 --> 00:10:05.129
and we could learn about his qualities

00:10:05.129 --> 00:10:07.129
from the things he's made.

00:10:07.129 --> 00:10:11.129
But the Bible teaches us so much more.

00:10:11.129 --> 00:10:15.129
In it, Jehovah tells us his own personal name,

00:10:15.129 --> 00:10:19.129
the purpose of life, and what the future holds.

00:10:19.129 --> 00:10:23.129
These are things that we'd expect a loving father

00:10:23.129 --> 00:10:26.129
to share with his beloved children.

00:10:26.129 --> 00:10:29.129
And what's more, Jehovah invites us

00:10:29.129 --> 00:10:33.129
to have a close relationship with him.

00:10:33.129 --> 00:10:37.129
What a tender and loving father.

00:10:37.129 --> 00:10:39.129
The practical guidance for life

00:10:39.129 --> 00:10:42.129
that the Bible contains is a third way

00:10:42.129 --> 00:10:45.129
that we feel Jehovah's love.

00:10:45.129 --> 00:10:47.129
It's a book from the creator

00:10:47.129 --> 00:10:50.129
that instructs us how to live a happy

00:10:50.129 --> 00:10:52.129
and satisfying life.

00:10:52.129 --> 00:10:54.129
It's like our owner's manual

00:10:54.129 --> 00:10:56.129
from the creator himself

00:10:56.129 --> 00:10:59.129
and how much we need it.

00:10:59.129 --> 00:11:03.129
Jesus saw how much people needed that guidance.

00:11:03.129 --> 00:11:06.129
Matthew 9.36 says,

00:11:07.129 --> 00:11:11.129
On seeing the crowds, he felt pity for them

00:11:11.129 --> 00:11:13.129
because they were skinned and thrown

00:11:13.129 --> 00:11:16.129
about like sheep without a shepherd.

00:11:16.129 --> 00:11:18.129
That's true today also.

00:11:18.129 --> 00:11:22.129
People are so confused and lost.

00:11:22.129 --> 00:11:24.129
They don't know what to do.

00:11:24.129 --> 00:11:27.129
They're often guided simply by their own thinking

00:11:27.129 --> 00:11:29.129
and desires.

00:11:29.129 --> 00:11:33.129
As a result, people end up in awful situations.

00:11:34.129 --> 00:11:36.129
We need reliable guidance

00:11:36.129 --> 00:11:39.129
to show us what's right and what's wrong

00:11:39.129 --> 00:11:42.129
and to help us find the way to happiness.

00:11:42.129 --> 00:11:45.129
And Jehovah has provided all of that

00:11:45.129 --> 00:11:49.129
in his precious gift, the Bible.

00:11:49.129 --> 00:11:52.129
Romans 15 verse 4 says,

00:11:52.129 --> 00:11:55.129
For all the things that were written beforehand

00:11:55.129 --> 00:11:58.129
were written for our instruction

00:11:58.129 --> 00:12:00.129
so that through our endurance

00:12:00.129 --> 00:12:02.129
and through the comfort from the scriptures,

00:12:02.129 --> 00:12:05.129
we might have hope.

00:12:05.129 --> 00:12:08.129
Even as our circumstances change,

00:12:08.129 --> 00:12:11.129
the Bible continues to be our manual for life.

00:12:11.129 --> 00:12:13.129
Whether young or old,

00:12:13.129 --> 00:12:15.129
single or married,

00:12:15.129 --> 00:12:18.129
the guidance and God's word always applies.

00:12:18.129 --> 00:12:20.129
It always works.

00:12:20.129 --> 00:12:23.129
As we reflect on all the ways

00:12:23.129 --> 00:12:26.129
that the Bible is a unique gift,

00:12:26.129 --> 00:12:29.129
what do we see or feel?

00:12:29.129 --> 00:12:32.129
We feel the tremendous love

00:12:32.129 --> 00:12:34.129
that Jehovah has for us

00:12:34.129 --> 00:12:36.129
in giving us this gift.

00:12:36.129 --> 00:12:39.129
He's made sure that all the information we need

00:12:39.129 --> 00:12:41.129
is inside it,

00:12:41.129 --> 00:12:45.129
and he helps us to apply it in our life.

00:12:45.129 --> 00:12:47.129
With what result?

00:12:47.129 --> 00:12:52.129
2 Timothy chapter 3 and verse 16 and 17 says,

00:12:52.129 --> 00:12:55.129
All scripture is inspired of God

00:12:55.129 --> 00:12:57.129
and beneficial for teaching,

00:12:57.129 --> 00:12:59.129
for reproving,

00:12:59.129 --> 00:13:01.129
for setting things straight,

00:13:01.129 --> 00:13:04.129
for disciplining in righteousness,

00:13:04.129 --> 00:13:07.129
so that the man of God may be fully competent,

00:13:07.129 --> 00:13:13.129
completely equipped for every good work.

00:13:13.129 --> 00:13:17.129
What have we learned in this brief discussion?

00:13:17.129 --> 00:13:21.129
Everything about the Bible reflects Jehovah's love.

00:13:21.129 --> 00:13:24.129
The miraculous way he preserved it.

00:13:24.129 --> 00:13:27.129
It's message from a loving Father

00:13:27.129 --> 00:13:31.129
and its practical guidance on how to live.

00:13:31.129 --> 00:13:34.129
Inheriting a precious gift

00:13:34.129 --> 00:13:37.129
does not guarantee that we will appreciate it.

00:13:37.129 --> 00:13:40.129
Likewise, simply having a Bible

00:13:40.129 --> 00:13:43.129
does not mean that we'll benefit from it.

00:13:43.129 --> 00:13:46.129
To benefit, we need to read His Word,

00:13:46.129 --> 00:13:50.129
the manual for life every day.

00:13:50.129 --> 00:13:53.129
As we read and study the Bible,

00:13:53.129 --> 00:13:56.129
we feel the great love of its author,

00:13:56.129 --> 00:13:59.129
our wonderful God, Jehovah.

00:13:59.129 --> 00:14:02.129
And the more we feel His love,

00:14:02.129 --> 00:14:06.129
the more we're moved to do what He wants us to do.

00:14:06.129 --> 00:14:10.129
That includes helping others to receive and benefit

00:14:10.129 --> 00:14:12.129
from this precious gift.

00:14:12.129 --> 00:14:16.129
In this way, we can help as many as possible

00:14:16.129 --> 00:14:18.129
to experience, yes,

00:14:18.129 --> 00:14:22.129
to really feel the love of God through the Bible.

00:14:23.129 --> 00:14:28.110
In ancient times, Bible writers worked hard

00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:31.110
to write down God's Word.

00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:35.110
But what techniques and materials did they use?

00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:39.870
Let's explore some of those methods.

00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:42.870
God inspired some 40 men to write the Bible.

00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:44.870
But have you ever wondered,

00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:46.870
what did they write it on?

00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:48.870
After all, the oldest portions of the Bible

00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:50.870
were written more than 1,000 years

00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:53.870
before the invention of what we know today as paper.

00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:56.870
The earliest Bible manuscripts were written

00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:59.870
on a material called papyrus.

00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:02.870
Papyrus is a plant that grows in shallow water

00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:05.870
with stalks that can reach almost 4.6 meters

00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:07.870
or about 15 feet high.

00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:09.870
Over 4,000 years ago,

00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:12.870
the Egyptians invented ways to turn papyrus

00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:17.870
into a smooth, strong writing material similar to paper.

00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:19.870
Even with modern tools,

00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:22.870
you can see it was a lot of work.

00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:24.870
Thin slices of the plant's core

00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:27.870
had to be soaked and flattened,

00:15:27.870 --> 00:15:29.870
arranged in layers,

00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:34.179
and then beaten and pressed

00:15:34.179 --> 00:15:37.179
to bind the layers together.

00:15:37.179 --> 00:15:39.179
When the sheets were dry,

00:15:39.179 --> 00:15:41.179
they were polished with a piece of ivory,

00:15:41.179 --> 00:15:44.179
a smooth shell, or even a stone.

00:15:44.179 --> 00:15:48.179
The result was a relatively smooth surface for writing.

00:15:48.179 --> 00:15:50.179
To make a scroll,

00:15:50.179 --> 00:15:53.179
individual sheets of papyrus were pasted together along the edges,

00:15:53.179 --> 00:15:56.179
to make a roll that might be more than 6 meters

00:15:56.179 --> 00:15:58.179
or about 20 feet in length.

00:15:58.179 --> 00:16:03.100
But around the second century CE,

00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:05.100
copyists began favoring a new technology

00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:09.100
that made papyrus documents much easier to use.

00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:11.100
The codex.

00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:12.100
With a codex,

00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:15.100
the papyrus pages were folded,

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:17.100
sewn, and bound together

00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:20.100
to form something similar to a modern book.

00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:22.100
Think of all the hours required

00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:25.100
to produce these materials to write on.

00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:27.100
But without modern pens and pencils,

00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:30.100
what did ancient people use to write with?

00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:33.419
The pens they used were often made

00:16:33.419 --> 00:16:36.419
from pieces of hard read like this.

00:16:36.419 --> 00:16:41.820
Carefully cut to produce a pointed slit.

00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:42.820
In Bible Times,

00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:44.820
one common type of ink that would be used

00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:46.820
with these read pens was made

00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:48.820
by combining blacksoot

00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:50.820
with a rubbery gum

00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:52.820
that helped it stick to the page.

00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:55.820
Then water was added to the mixture.

00:16:55.820 --> 00:17:03.549
Whether in the form of a scroll or a codex,

00:17:03.549 --> 00:17:05.549
the problem with papyrus

00:17:05.549 --> 00:17:08.549
was that it decomposed easily.

00:17:08.549 --> 00:17:09.549
Amazingly,

00:17:09.549 --> 00:17:11.549
there are many fragments of Bible manuscripts

00:17:11.549 --> 00:17:15.549
on papyrus that have survived down to our day.

00:17:15.549 --> 00:17:17.549
What you see here are reproductions of fragments

00:17:17.549 --> 00:17:20.549
that are more than 2,000 years old.

00:17:20.549 --> 00:17:22.549
In time,

00:17:22.549 --> 00:17:23.549
Bible manuscripts began to be copied

00:17:23.549 --> 00:17:26.549
onto more durable materials.

00:17:26.549 --> 00:17:28.549
By about the 4th century,

00:17:28.549 --> 00:17:30.549
the most common of those was parchment.

00:17:30.549 --> 00:17:32.549
It was normally made from the hides of sheep,

00:17:32.549 --> 00:17:35.549
calves or goats.

00:17:35.549 --> 00:17:39.549
The process begins by soaking the hide and water in line,

00:17:39.549 --> 00:17:42.549
then removing the hair and excess flesh.

00:17:42.549 --> 00:17:48.829
After that,

00:17:48.829 --> 00:17:50.829
the skin is stretched on a frame

00:17:50.829 --> 00:17:51.829
and scraped with a knife

00:17:51.829 --> 00:17:54.829
to remove any residues like fat.

00:17:54.829 --> 00:17:56.829
The next step is to dry the skin

00:17:56.829 --> 00:17:58.829
under increased tension,

00:17:58.829 --> 00:18:00.829
which causes it to become stiff and flat.

00:18:02.829 --> 00:18:03.829
Finally,

00:18:03.829 --> 00:18:04.829
it's dusted with chalk

00:18:04.829 --> 00:18:06.829
and sanded smooth with pumice

00:18:06.829 --> 00:18:10.829
to create an even writing surface.

00:18:10.829 --> 00:18:11.829
As you can see,

00:18:11.829 --> 00:18:13.829
making even one sheet of parchment

00:18:13.829 --> 00:18:16.829
requires a tremendous amount of work.

00:18:16.829 --> 00:18:17.829
But today,

00:18:17.829 --> 00:18:18.829
there are many Bible manuscripts

00:18:18.829 --> 00:18:19.829
that were written on parchment,

00:18:19.829 --> 00:18:23.829
such as these two original manuscripts here.

00:18:23.829 --> 00:18:25.829
Another famous manuscript

00:18:25.829 --> 00:18:26.829
is the Codex Amiatinus

00:18:26.829 --> 00:18:27.829
located in Italy,

00:18:27.829 --> 00:18:30.829
which is over 1,300 years old.

00:18:30.829 --> 00:18:31.829
In fact,

00:18:31.829 --> 00:18:32.829
it's the oldest,

00:18:32.829 --> 00:18:33.829
complete Latin Bible

00:18:33.829 --> 00:18:36.829
bound in a single volume ever found.

00:18:36.829 --> 00:18:37.829
Some historians feel

00:18:37.829 --> 00:18:38.829
that it required the hides

00:18:38.829 --> 00:18:41.829
of over 400 animals to produce.

00:18:41.829 --> 00:18:45.460
This replica is big,

00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:47.460
but the original is even larger.

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:49.460
It weighs 34 kilograms

00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:53.900
or about 75 pounds.

00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:54.900
Think of all of the work

00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:55.900
that went into producing

00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:57.900
just that one Bible.

00:18:57.900 --> 00:18:59.900
Well, all of these materials

00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:00.900
are perishable

00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:02.900
and deteriorate with time.

00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:04.900
But to preserve his word,

00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:05.900
Jehovah God sought to it

00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:06.900
that the Bible was

00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:07.900
meticulously copied

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:09.900
and recopied over the centuries,

00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:10.900
so that today,

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:11.900
we have not just a few,

00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:13.900
but thousands of manuscripts

00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:16.900
of various parts of the Bible.

00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:17.900
So the next time you look

00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:18.900
up a Bible verse

00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:19.900
by tapping on a link,

00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:21.900
think about what it took

00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:23.900
to put those words in writing,

00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:24.900
and how amazing it is

00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:25.900
that Jehovah's Word

00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:27.900
recorded using these ancient,

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:28.900
fragile materials,

00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:35.069
is still with us today.

00:19:35.069 --> 00:19:36.069
We're grateful

00:19:36.069 --> 00:19:38.069
to the countless God-fearing men

00:19:38.069 --> 00:19:40.069
who carefully wrote down

00:19:40.069 --> 00:19:42.069
and copied the Bible.

00:19:42.069 --> 00:19:44.069
Their hard work made it possible

00:19:44.069 --> 00:19:46.069
for us to have it today,

00:19:46.069 --> 00:19:47.069
thus fulfilling the words

00:19:47.069 --> 00:19:49.069
of the prophet Isaiah,

00:19:49.069 --> 00:19:51.069
the Word of our God,

00:19:51.069 --> 00:19:54.069
endures forever.

00:19:54.069 --> 00:19:55.069
Our great God, Jehovah,

00:19:55.069 --> 00:19:56.069
has used people

00:19:56.069 --> 00:19:58.069
from all walks of life

00:19:58.069 --> 00:20:00.069
to preserve his message

00:20:00.069 --> 00:20:02.069
and holy name.

00:20:02.069 --> 00:20:03.069
One such person

00:20:03.069 --> 00:20:05.069
was Benjamin Boothroyd,

00:20:05.069 --> 00:20:07.069
the son of a humble shoemaker,

00:20:07.069 --> 00:20:09.069
who became a minister

00:20:09.069 --> 00:20:11.069
and a printer.

00:20:11.069 --> 00:20:13.069
What caused this ordinary man

00:20:13.069 --> 00:20:16.069
to become a self-taught scholar

00:20:16.069 --> 00:20:18.069
and Bible translator?

00:20:18.069 --> 00:20:19.069
Let's find out.

00:20:19.069 --> 00:20:24.529
We sincerely congratulate

00:20:24.529 --> 00:20:27.529
Dr. B, on having completed a task

00:20:27.529 --> 00:20:29.529
that was perhaps never before

00:20:29.529 --> 00:20:32.529
accomplished by a single individual.

00:20:32.529 --> 00:20:35.529
Namely, a corrected Hebrew text

00:20:35.529 --> 00:20:37.529
of the Old Testament

00:20:37.529 --> 00:20:39.529
and a revised English version

00:20:39.529 --> 00:20:42.529
of the whole Bible.

00:20:42.529 --> 00:20:44.529
Benjamin Boothroyd was born

00:20:44.529 --> 00:20:48.529
in 1768 to a humble shoemaker.

00:20:48.529 --> 00:20:49.529
He lived his whole life

00:20:49.529 --> 00:20:51.529
in Yorkshire, England.

00:20:51.529 --> 00:20:53.529
Boothroyd wasn't wealthy

00:20:53.529 --> 00:20:55.529
or prominent,

00:20:55.529 --> 00:20:57.529
yet he accomplished something remarkable

00:20:57.529 --> 00:21:02.529
in the field of Bible translation.

00:21:02.529 --> 00:21:03.529
As a young man,

00:21:03.529 --> 00:21:05.529
Boothroyd and his friends

00:21:05.529 --> 00:21:07.529
would attend church

00:21:07.529 --> 00:21:09.529
and then go to a local ale house,

00:21:09.529 --> 00:21:13.529
not dissimilar to this one.

00:21:13.529 --> 00:21:15.529
It was on one of these occasions

00:21:15.529 --> 00:21:17.529
that Boothroyd experienced something

00:21:17.529 --> 00:21:19.529
that changed his life.

00:21:19.529 --> 00:21:21.529
The conversation was unusually

00:21:21.529 --> 00:21:23.529
profane and simple in which

00:21:23.529 --> 00:21:25.529
I joined and was perhaps

00:21:25.529 --> 00:21:28.529
worse than any of my companions.

00:21:28.529 --> 00:21:30.529
With a suddenness of almost a flash

00:21:30.529 --> 00:21:31.529
of lightning,

00:21:31.529 --> 00:21:33.529
my mind was struck with horror

00:21:33.529 --> 00:21:36.529
under a sense of my sin and guilt

00:21:36.529 --> 00:21:38.529
that I was a suitable victim

00:21:38.529 --> 00:21:42.529
for the miseries of hell.

00:21:42.529 --> 00:21:44.529
Without saying a word,

00:21:44.529 --> 00:21:46.529
Boothroyd left the ale house

00:21:46.529 --> 00:21:48.529
and his companions behind.

00:21:48.529 --> 00:21:53.630
As he walked home,

00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:55.630
he got down on his knees

00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:59.630
and begged God to have mercy on him.

00:21:59.630 --> 00:22:01.630
It was a pivotal moment.

00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:03.630
He resolved to dedicate

00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:06.630
the rest of his life to God.

00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:10.329
We're here at the National Library of Wales

00:22:10.329 --> 00:22:12.329
to reveal the next chapter

00:22:12.329 --> 00:22:14.329
of Boothroyd's story.

00:22:14.329 --> 00:22:23.880
In 1801,

00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:25.880
Boothroyd married Sarah Hurst

00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:28.880
who shared his devotion and faith.

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:30.880
To supplement their income,

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:32.880
a couple ran a small bookshop

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:33.880
and printery.

00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:35.880
It was there

00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:38.880
Boothroyd acquired these books.

00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:41.880
Lectures on the sacred poetry

00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:43.880
of the Hebrews.

00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:45.880
Those lectures on Hebrew

00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:47.880
poetry fell into my hands.

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:50.880
I read it with peculiar pleasure.

00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:52.880
Boothroyd fell in love

00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:54.880
with the Hebrew language.

00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:56.880
He decided to learn it.

00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:58.880
But how?

00:22:58.880 --> 00:22:59.880
Boothroyd noticed

00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:01.880
that some of the Psalms

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:02.880
were split into standards

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:05.880
using different Hebrew letters.

00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:07.880
The names of the letters

00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:09.880
came from the 119th Psalm.

00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:11.880
And I began to read

00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:13.880
the early part of the Pentateuch.

00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:16.880
He painstakingly taught himself

00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:18.880
Hebrew letters,

00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:19.880
then words,

00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:20.880
then grammar,

00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:22.880
until he could read the Bible

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:23.880
in Hebrew.

00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:27.259
On comparing the latest

00:23:27.259 --> 00:23:29.259
Hebrew printed texts,

00:23:29.259 --> 00:23:30.259
such as these

00:23:30.259 --> 00:23:32.259
by Benjamin Kenikot

00:23:32.259 --> 00:23:34.259
with older available manuscripts,

00:23:34.259 --> 00:23:35.259
Boothroyd discovered

00:23:35.259 --> 00:23:38.259
something troubling.

00:23:38.259 --> 00:23:41.259
It had many errors.

00:23:41.259 --> 00:23:42.259
This led him

00:23:42.259 --> 00:23:45.259
to a monumental decision.

00:23:45.259 --> 00:23:47.259
Boothroyd began a project

00:23:47.259 --> 00:23:49.259
to compile and publish

00:23:49.259 --> 00:23:51.259
a more accurate Hebrew text

00:23:51.259 --> 00:23:55.180
of the Old Testament.

00:23:55.180 --> 00:23:57.180
While he did the majority

00:23:57.180 --> 00:23:58.180
of the work,

00:23:58.180 --> 00:24:00.180
he wasn't alone.

00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:02.180
My wife learned the names

00:24:02.180 --> 00:24:03.180
of the Hebrew letters,

00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:05.180
and we examined the sheets,

00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:06.180
not by uttering words,

00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:08.180
but by pronouncing

00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:10.180
by letter.

00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:12.180
Sarah helped her husband

00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:13.180
proofread the work

00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:15.180
to confirm the accuracy.

00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:18.180
After years of meticulous work,

00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:21.180
they completed Boothroyd's

00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:22.180
Biblia Hebraica

00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:23.180
in two volumes

00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:25.180
in 1816.

00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:27.180
Many would consider such

00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:28.180
an accomplishment

00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:29.180
to be the achievement

00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:31.180
of a lifetime.

00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:33.180
But Boothroyd

00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:34.180
was about to begin

00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:37.180
another major undertaking.

00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:40.180
Boothroyd felt it was his duty

00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:42.180
to produce a revised Bible

00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:44.180
in plain English,

00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:46.180
a Bible that anyone

00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:47.180
could understand.

00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:49.180
So, with the knowledge,

00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:50.180
materials, and means

00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:51.180
available to him,

00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:53.180
he went back to work.

00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:56.940
We're now at the University

00:24:56.940 --> 00:24:57.940
in Lampeter

00:24:57.940 --> 00:24:59.940
to find out what Boothroyd accomplished.

00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:05.740
Just two years later,

00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:07.740
in 1818,

00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:09.740
he published the first volume

00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:11.740
of a new family Bible.

00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:13.740
The second volume was completed

00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:15.740
in 1821,

00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:17.740
and by 1824,

00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:19.740
the entire English translation

00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:21.740
was released.

00:25:21.740 --> 00:25:22.740
Once again,

00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:24.740
he hadn't accomplished this

00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:25.740
on his own.

00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:27.740
Through the whole of this important

00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:29.740
and laborious work,

00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:31.740
Mrs. Boothroyd was my

00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:33.740
chief support and assistant

00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:34.740
and to her,

00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:35.740
the public are as much

00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:37.740
indebted as myself.

00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:39.740
A new family Bible

00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:40.740
was appreciated

00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:42.740
by scholars and faithful

00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:44.740
Bible readers alike.

00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:46.740
One thing in particular

00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:48.740
made Boothroyd's Bible

00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:50.740
especially significant.

00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:52.740
Boothroyd followed this rule

00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:53.740
while translating.

00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:55.740
I have adopted Chahova

00:25:55.740 --> 00:25:56.740
instead of Lord,

00:25:56.740 --> 00:25:57.740
and Chahova God

00:25:57.740 --> 00:25:59.740
is certainly more proper

00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:01.740
and just to the original

00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:03.740
than Lord God.

00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:05.740
This was the first

00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:07.740
English Bible ever published

00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:09.740
to consistently use Chahova

00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:11.740
in the Old Testament.

00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:13.740
Boothroyd also included

00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:14.740
it several times

00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:16.740
in the New Testament.

00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:19.740
The University of Glasgow

00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:21.740
awarded Boothroyd a degree

00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:24.740
in recognition of this outstanding

00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:26.740
piece of scholarship.

00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:28.740
His new family Bible was later

00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:30.740
used as the basis

00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:31.740
for translating the Bible

00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:32.740
into languages

00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:34.740
of the South Pacific,

00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:36.740
such as Tahisha.

00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:37.740
As a result,

00:26:37.740 --> 00:26:39.740
these two used Chahova's name

00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:41.740
extensively.

00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:47.390
Using what was available to him,

00:26:47.390 --> 00:26:49.390
Boothroyd peered

00:26:49.390 --> 00:26:51.390
into the Scriptures,

00:26:51.390 --> 00:26:53.390
seeking to know their meaning,

00:26:53.390 --> 00:26:55.390
and then worked to share

00:26:55.390 --> 00:26:57.390
that knowledge with others.

00:26:57.390 --> 00:26:59.390
In his dedication

00:26:59.390 --> 00:27:01.390
to his new family Bible,

00:27:01.390 --> 00:27:02.390
he wrote,

00:27:02.390 --> 00:27:07.410
I have no interest to serve

00:27:07.410 --> 00:27:09.410
but that of truth.

00:27:09.410 --> 00:27:11.410
This man

00:27:11.410 --> 00:27:13.410
of lowly origins

00:27:13.410 --> 00:27:15.410
achieved something truly rare.

00:27:15.410 --> 00:27:18.410
His works gave people knowledge

00:27:18.410 --> 00:27:19.410
of God's word,

00:27:19.410 --> 00:27:21.410
God's will,

00:27:21.410 --> 00:27:23.410
and God's name.

00:27:23.410 --> 00:27:29.789
How encouraging it was

00:27:29.789 --> 00:27:31.789
to see Boothroyd's efforts

00:27:31.789 --> 00:27:33.789
to help others understand God's word

00:27:33.789 --> 00:27:36.789
and to restore God's name

00:27:36.789 --> 00:27:40.519
to the English Bible.

00:27:40.519 --> 00:27:41.519
Through the Bible,

00:27:41.519 --> 00:27:43.519
Chahova also expresses his love

00:27:43.519 --> 00:27:44.519
for another group,

00:27:44.519 --> 00:27:46.519
Orphans.

00:27:46.519 --> 00:27:48.519
He wants these dear ones

00:27:48.519 --> 00:27:50.519
to feel especially cared for.

00:27:50.519 --> 00:27:52.519
Let's see how

00:27:52.519 --> 00:27:54.519
Nazar Kamar,

00:27:54.519 --> 00:27:56.519
a deaf man who was also

00:27:56.519 --> 00:27:58.519
an orphan,

00:27:58.519 --> 00:28:03.400
came to feel Chahova's love.

00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:05.400
When I was a child,

00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:07.400
I attended a boarding school.

00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:09.400
All of my basic needs

00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:12.809
were taken care of.

00:28:12.809 --> 00:28:14.809
But on the weekends,

00:28:14.809 --> 00:28:16.809
I noticed that the other kids

00:28:16.809 --> 00:28:18.809
had parents that would take them home.

00:28:18.809 --> 00:28:20.809
No one ever came to take me home.

00:28:20.809 --> 00:28:24.309
They seemed so happy.

00:28:24.309 --> 00:28:28.170
I was alone.

00:28:28.170 --> 00:28:32.890
My name is Nazar Kamar.

00:28:32.890 --> 00:28:36.890
I was born in Kiev, Ukraine.

00:28:36.890 --> 00:28:38.890
And seven days after I was born,

00:28:38.890 --> 00:28:40.890
when I was still just a baby,

00:28:40.890 --> 00:28:44.890
my parents abandoned me.

00:28:44.890 --> 00:28:49.670
The school principal

00:28:49.670 --> 00:28:51.670
and teachers took turns caring for me.

00:28:51.670 --> 00:28:54.670
But I saw the other parents

00:28:54.670 --> 00:28:56.670
and how much they loved their children.

00:28:56.670 --> 00:29:00.670
I really wanted to have my own parents.

00:29:00.670 --> 00:29:02.670
I waited for them to come.

00:29:02.670 --> 00:29:04.670
But they never did.

00:29:04.670 --> 00:29:06.670
It was very painful.

00:29:06.670 --> 00:29:10.670
So I decided I needed a goal to focus on.

00:29:10.670 --> 00:29:15.940
I hoped my parents were looking for me.

00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:17.940
And I thought playing sports

00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:19.940
might help them find me.

00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:21.940
They might see me

00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:23.940
and recognize that I am their son.

00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:25.940
I concentrated on getting good

00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:27.940
enough to play professionally.

00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:29.940
I learned to play very well.

00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:34.140
But my hope always was

00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:36.140
that when I traveled to different places,

00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:40.140
my parents might be sitting in the stands.

00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:42.140
And they would see me and say,

00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:44.140
this is our son.

00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:46.140
We found you.

00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:51.539
I began playing in a national league.

00:29:51.539 --> 00:29:55.539
And the team provided me a small room to live in

00:29:55.539 --> 00:29:59.539
and began to pay me a salary.

00:29:59.539 --> 00:30:01.539
It was not much.

00:30:01.539 --> 00:30:05.539
And not enough to live on.

00:30:05.539 --> 00:30:09.539
So I also got a job working at a factory.

00:30:09.539 --> 00:30:13.299
While working there, I met Sidge.

00:30:13.299 --> 00:30:18.670
He was one of Joe's witnesses.

00:30:18.670 --> 00:30:20.670
He would show me scriptures from the Bible,

00:30:20.670 --> 00:30:22.670
like Revelation 21, 3 and 4.

00:30:22.670 --> 00:30:24.670
About a future paradise

00:30:24.670 --> 00:30:26.670
with wonderful conditions

00:30:26.670 --> 00:30:28.670
where there would be no more suffering

00:30:28.670 --> 00:30:32.079
or pain.

00:30:32.079 --> 00:30:34.079
I wanted a life like that.

00:30:34.079 --> 00:30:38.079
But I didn't see those conditions around me.

00:30:38.079 --> 00:30:40.079
My life was very hard.

00:30:40.079 --> 00:30:44.079
So these promises were difficult to believe.

00:30:44.079 --> 00:30:47.460
Sidge also showed me God's name in the Bible

00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:49.460
at Exodus 15-3.

00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:53.460
And he explained to me the meaning of God's name, Jehovah.

00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:57.460
That he can become whatever he chooses to become.

00:30:57.460 --> 00:30:59.460
When I connected that name

00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:03.460
with his promise at Revelation 21, 3 and 4,

00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:05.460
it was then that I started to believe it.

00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:10.240
At my first meeting,

00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:12.240
I was amazed by what I saw.

00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:16.240
The hearing and the deaf were communicating together.

00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:18.240
They had unity,

00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:20.240
and they cared for each other.

00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:22.240
I felt comfortable there.

00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:25.549
At one of the meetings,

00:31:25.549 --> 00:31:27.549
I saw the verse at Psalm 68-5,

00:31:27.549 --> 00:31:29.549
which refers to Jehovah God

00:31:29.549 --> 00:31:31.549
as the Father of the Fatherless.

00:31:31.549 --> 00:31:33.549
I was touched.

00:31:33.549 --> 00:31:37.549
He knows exactly how hard it is to be an orphan.

00:31:37.549 --> 00:31:39.549
He fully understands me.

00:31:39.549 --> 00:31:41.549
It gave me goose bumps.

00:31:41.549 --> 00:31:43.549
And I felt an inner peace and comfort.

00:31:43.549 --> 00:31:48.859
When my basketball team and the deaf community

00:31:48.859 --> 00:31:52.859
learned that I was studying the Bible with Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:31:52.859 --> 00:31:56.240
they were very upset with me.

00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:58.240
They told me I would lose their support.

00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:04.509
I would lose my salary and housing.

00:32:04.509 --> 00:32:06.509
I was at a crossroads.

00:32:06.509 --> 00:32:08.509
Since I'm an orphan,

00:32:08.509 --> 00:32:10.509
where would I live?

00:32:10.509 --> 00:32:12.509
This was a very difficult time.

00:32:12.509 --> 00:32:18.910
I noticed that I didn't feel the same unity

00:32:18.910 --> 00:32:20.910
or connection with my team,

00:32:20.910 --> 00:32:24.910
as I did with Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:32:24.910 --> 00:32:28.910
So, I decided to continue to study the Bible.

00:32:28.910 --> 00:32:32.740
I gave up their support.

00:32:32.740 --> 00:32:34.740
And God baptized.

00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:38.750
Jehovah has blessed me.

00:32:38.750 --> 00:32:40.750
I am no longer alone.

00:32:40.750 --> 00:32:42.750
I have my own family now.

00:32:42.750 --> 00:32:44.750
My wife, yet the Kia.

00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:48.750
We love and cherish each other so much.

00:32:48.750 --> 00:32:52.859
He has also given me brothers and sisters

00:32:52.859 --> 00:32:54.859
who care about me.

00:32:54.859 --> 00:32:58.859
They are my spiritual family.

00:32:58.859 --> 00:33:02.859
My life is no longer full of pain.

00:33:02.859 --> 00:33:04.859
Today, I still search for my parents

00:33:04.859 --> 00:33:06.859
and wait for them.

00:33:06.859 --> 00:33:08.859
Because when I find them,

00:33:08.859 --> 00:33:10.859
I want to help them

00:33:10.859 --> 00:33:12.859
by telling them about God's name.

00:33:12.859 --> 00:33:16.859
Now, I no longer consider myself an orphan,

00:33:16.859 --> 00:33:18.859
because I have a father.

00:33:18.859 --> 00:33:20.859
My father in heaven,

00:33:20.859 --> 00:33:22.859
whose name is Jehovah.

00:33:22.859 --> 00:33:24.859
When we search for love and acceptance

00:33:24.859 --> 00:33:30.059
in the congregation,

00:33:30.059 --> 00:33:34.059
we'll find that we belong to a caring family.

00:33:34.059 --> 00:33:38.059
Lovers of truth have sacrificed

00:33:38.059 --> 00:33:40.059
more than time and energy.

00:33:40.059 --> 00:33:42.059
Many of sacrifice their very lives

00:33:42.059 --> 00:33:44.059
so that we can have God's word

00:33:44.059 --> 00:33:46.059
in a language we understand.

00:33:46.059 --> 00:33:50.059
Let's visit the Belgium Bethel Bible Museum

00:33:50.059 --> 00:33:54.059
to learn who took such a risk and why.

00:33:54.059 --> 00:34:03.539
Jehovah gave us the Bible

00:34:03.539 --> 00:34:05.539
so that we could know Him

00:34:05.539 --> 00:34:07.539
and love Him.

00:34:07.539 --> 00:34:11.539
He wants us to become His friends.

00:34:11.539 --> 00:34:16.980
Jehovah made sure that the Bible

00:34:16.980 --> 00:34:18.980
would be available

00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:20.980
no matter where people live

00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:22.980
or what language they speak.

00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:26.699
The Bible Museum,

00:34:26.699 --> 00:34:28.699
located at the branch office

00:34:28.699 --> 00:34:30.699
of Jehovah's Witnesses in Brussels, Belgium,

00:34:30.699 --> 00:34:32.699
with the theme,

00:34:32.699 --> 00:34:34.699
the Bible and the low countries,

00:34:34.699 --> 00:34:36.699
tells the fascinating story

00:34:36.699 --> 00:34:38.699
of Bible translation and production

00:34:38.699 --> 00:34:40.699
in the coastal region

00:34:40.699 --> 00:34:42.699
of Northwestern Europe.

00:34:42.699 --> 00:34:44.699
In this museum,

00:34:44.699 --> 00:34:46.699
you will learn of honest hearted people

00:34:46.699 --> 00:34:48.699
who came to love the Bible

00:34:48.699 --> 00:34:50.699
and wanted to make it available to others.

00:34:50.699 --> 00:34:57.599
Throughout the Middle Ages,

00:34:57.599 --> 00:34:59.599
the Roman Catholic Church

00:34:59.599 --> 00:35:01.599
feared the spread of Bibles

00:35:01.599 --> 00:35:03.599
in vernacular languages.

00:35:03.599 --> 00:35:05.599
Understanding the Bible

00:35:05.599 --> 00:35:07.599
would have exposed the

00:35:07.599 --> 00:35:09.599
unchristian behavior of the Church.

00:35:09.599 --> 00:35:13.599
This led to cruel persecution

00:35:13.599 --> 00:35:15.599
of Bible translators.

00:35:15.599 --> 00:35:17.599
What role did the region

00:35:17.599 --> 00:35:19.599
of the low countries play

00:35:19.599 --> 00:35:23.599
in this overheated religious atmosphere?

00:35:23.599 --> 00:35:25.599
By the 16th century,

00:35:25.599 --> 00:35:27.599
the city of Antwerp, Belgium,

00:35:27.599 --> 00:35:29.599
had become the leading

00:35:29.599 --> 00:35:31.599
commercial center of Western Europe.

00:35:31.599 --> 00:35:33.599
Antwerp's relatively tolerant

00:35:33.599 --> 00:35:35.599
religious and political climate

00:35:35.599 --> 00:35:37.599
made it an ideal hub

00:35:37.599 --> 00:35:39.599
for translating and printing Bibles

00:35:39.599 --> 00:35:41.599
in common everyday languages.

00:35:41.599 --> 00:35:43.599
About 270 printers,

00:35:43.599 --> 00:35:45.599
publishers and booksellers

00:35:45.599 --> 00:35:47.599
were located in this cosmopolitan city.

00:35:47.599 --> 00:35:49.599
In addition,

00:35:49.599 --> 00:35:51.599
the significant seaport

00:35:51.599 --> 00:35:53.599
was perfect for smuggling Bibles

00:35:53.599 --> 00:35:55.599
to neighboring countries.

00:35:55.599 --> 00:35:57.599
One of the many printers

00:35:57.599 --> 00:35:59.599
working in Antwerp

00:35:59.599 --> 00:36:01.599
was Jakub van Lee's belt.

00:36:01.599 --> 00:36:03.599
In 1526,

00:36:03.599 --> 00:36:05.599
he courageously published

00:36:05.599 --> 00:36:07.599
the first complete Bible in Dutch.

00:36:07.599 --> 00:36:09.599
This was one of the first Bibles

00:36:09.599 --> 00:36:11.599
printed in a single volume.

00:36:11.599 --> 00:36:13.599
Van Lee's belt eventually printed

00:36:13.599 --> 00:36:15.599
a total of 19 Bible editions.

00:36:15.599 --> 00:36:19.599
Despite the comparatively safe working conditions

00:36:19.599 --> 00:36:21.599
in Antwerp, Bible publishers

00:36:21.599 --> 00:36:23.599
were not fully protected from the church.

00:36:23.599 --> 00:36:27.599
Van Lee's belt was condemned to death

00:36:27.599 --> 00:36:29.599
for including marginal notes

00:36:29.599 --> 00:36:31.599
in his final edition of the Dutch Bible.

00:36:31.599 --> 00:36:33.599
Notes which the Catholic Church

00:36:33.599 --> 00:36:35.599
found offensive to their dogma.

00:36:35.599 --> 00:36:37.599
He was one of several

00:36:37.599 --> 00:36:39.599
Antwerp Bible printers

00:36:39.599 --> 00:36:41.599
executed for their work.

00:36:41.599 --> 00:36:43.599
A translator

00:36:43.599 --> 00:36:45.599
who also published his work in Antwerp

00:36:45.599 --> 00:36:47.599
was the French scholar

00:36:47.599 --> 00:36:49.599
Jacques Lafevre de Tape.

00:36:49.599 --> 00:36:51.599
He dedicated himself

00:36:51.599 --> 00:36:53.599
to restoring the original meaning

00:36:53.599 --> 00:36:55.599
of ancient writings

00:36:55.599 --> 00:36:57.599
and studied closely

00:36:57.599 --> 00:36:59.599
the Latin Volgate Bible.

00:36:59.599 --> 00:37:01.599
He strongly believed

00:37:01.599 --> 00:37:03.599
in the right

00:37:03.599 --> 00:37:05.599
of every Christian

00:37:05.599 --> 00:37:07.599
to read and learn the Bible personally.

00:37:07.599 --> 00:37:09.599
Therefore,

00:37:09.599 --> 00:37:11.599
the Fevre devoted all his energy

00:37:11.599 --> 00:37:13.599
to translating the Bible into French.

00:37:13.599 --> 00:37:15.599
It was the first

00:37:15.599 --> 00:37:17.599
complete Bible to be printed

00:37:17.599 --> 00:37:19.599
in this language.

00:37:19.599 --> 00:37:21.599
He was sure

00:37:21.599 --> 00:37:23.599
the Gospels would be, as he said,

00:37:23.599 --> 00:37:25.599
purely proclaimed

00:37:25.599 --> 00:37:27.599
throughout the world

00:37:27.599 --> 00:37:29.599
so that people may no longer be

00:37:29.599 --> 00:37:31.599
led astray by alien doctrines of men.

00:37:31.599 --> 00:37:33.599
Although his Bible translation

00:37:33.599 --> 00:37:35.599
initially was approved

00:37:35.599 --> 00:37:37.599
by the Holy Roman Emperor

00:37:37.599 --> 00:37:39.599
Charles V. In 1546,

00:37:39.599 --> 00:37:41.599
the Fevre's second edition

00:37:41.599 --> 00:37:43.599
was placed on the

00:37:43.599 --> 00:37:45.599
Roman Catholic Church's

00:37:45.599 --> 00:37:47.599
index of forbidden books.

00:37:47.599 --> 00:37:49.599
Another courageous man,

00:37:49.599 --> 00:37:51.599
one who translated the scriptures

00:37:51.599 --> 00:37:53.599
into English, was a clergyman

00:37:53.599 --> 00:37:55.599
and a scholar of Greek

00:37:55.599 --> 00:37:57.599
and Latin.

00:37:57.599 --> 00:37:59.599
The name of this man was

00:37:59.599 --> 00:38:01.599
William Tindale.

00:38:01.599 --> 00:38:03.599
He was passionate about God's word.

00:38:03.599 --> 00:38:05.599
Tindale wrote,

00:38:05.599 --> 00:38:07.599
we must desire God

00:38:07.599 --> 00:38:09.599
to make us understand

00:38:09.599 --> 00:38:11.599
and feel

00:38:11.599 --> 00:38:13.599
wherefor the scripture was given.

00:38:13.599 --> 00:38:15.599
That we may apply the medicine

00:38:15.599 --> 00:38:17.599
of the scripture.

00:38:17.599 --> 00:38:19.599
For translating the new testament

00:38:19.599 --> 00:38:21.599
into English, he was chased

00:38:21.599 --> 00:38:23.599
and hunted by church and state.

00:38:23.599 --> 00:38:25.599
He sought refuge in various cities

00:38:25.599 --> 00:38:27.599
including the city of Antwerp.

00:38:27.599 --> 00:38:29.599
Here,

00:38:29.599 --> 00:38:31.599
he published a revised version

00:38:31.599 --> 00:38:33.599
of the new testament

00:38:33.599 --> 00:38:35.599
and his translation

00:38:35.599 --> 00:38:37.599
of the Pentateuch

00:38:37.599 --> 00:38:39.599
where he used Jehovah's name

00:38:39.599 --> 00:38:41.599
for the first time

00:38:41.599 --> 00:38:43.599
in an English translation.

00:38:43.599 --> 00:38:45.599
Tindale also was executed

00:38:45.599 --> 00:38:47.599
for his translation work.

00:38:47.599 --> 00:38:49.599
Publishing Bibles

00:38:49.599 --> 00:38:51.599
in Spain was a very

00:38:51.599 --> 00:38:53.599
dangerous undertaking.

00:38:53.599 --> 00:38:55.599
For this reason,

00:38:55.599 --> 00:38:57.599
in 1543, the translator

00:38:57.599 --> 00:38:59.599
Francisco Danthenus

00:38:59.599 --> 00:39:01.599
also printed in Antwerp.

00:39:01.599 --> 00:39:03.599
It was the first

00:39:03.599 --> 00:39:05.599
Spanish version to be translated

00:39:05.599 --> 00:39:07.599
directly from the original

00:39:07.599 --> 00:39:09.599
Greek text.

00:39:09.599 --> 00:39:11.599
He wrote,

00:39:11.599 --> 00:39:13.599
it seemed to me that I had

00:39:13.599 --> 00:39:15.599
but one task.

00:39:15.599 --> 00:39:17.599
To commit to the press,

00:39:17.599 --> 00:39:19.599
the work I had taken

00:39:19.599 --> 00:39:21.599
pains to produce.

00:39:21.599 --> 00:39:23.599
And then commended to God,

00:39:23.599 --> 00:39:27.519
the father of the whole business

00:39:27.519 --> 00:39:29.519
for whose cause it had been made.

00:39:29.519 --> 00:39:31.519
So arrested for his work.

00:39:31.519 --> 00:39:33.519
Yet, some copies of his

00:39:33.519 --> 00:39:35.519
new testament made it to Spain.

00:39:35.519 --> 00:39:37.519
It had a strong influence

00:39:37.519 --> 00:39:39.519
on other Spanish translations

00:39:39.519 --> 00:39:41.519
such as the widely

00:39:41.519 --> 00:39:43.519
known Reina Valera Bible.

00:39:43.519 --> 00:39:45.519
The first edition of which

00:39:45.519 --> 00:39:47.519
was also printed in the low countries.

00:39:47.519 --> 00:39:50.960
There are many more

00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:52.960
intriguing gems for you

00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:54.960
to discover in this museum.

00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:56.960
Like the Antwerp Polyglot,

00:39:56.960 --> 00:39:58.960
which contains Bible text

00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:00.960
of five languages.

00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:02.960
And the secretly produced

00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:04.960
Dutch Jehovah Bible.

00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:06.960
All printed

00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:11.389
in the low countries.

00:40:11.389 --> 00:40:13.389
All these men displayed

00:40:13.389 --> 00:40:15.389
love for God's word.

00:40:15.389 --> 00:40:17.389
And Jehovah blessed their efforts

00:40:17.389 --> 00:40:19.389
because the work that they did

00:40:19.389 --> 00:40:21.389
set in motion a series of events

00:40:21.389 --> 00:40:23.389
that have resulted in God's word

00:40:23.389 --> 00:40:25.389
being available today

00:40:25.389 --> 00:40:27.389
in thousands of languages.

00:40:27.389 --> 00:40:31.699
The Bible Museum

00:40:31.699 --> 00:40:33.699
in Belgium is one

00:40:33.699 --> 00:40:35.699
of our many museums

00:40:35.699 --> 00:40:37.699
around the world.

00:40:37.699 --> 00:40:39.699
Each highlighting unique

00:40:39.699 --> 00:40:41.699
aspects of the fascinating history

00:40:41.699 --> 00:40:43.699
of God's word.

00:40:43.699 --> 00:40:45.699
These exhibitions deep

00:40:45.699 --> 00:40:47.699
in our appreciation for the Bible.

00:40:47.699 --> 00:40:49.699
And the truthfulness

00:40:49.699 --> 00:40:51.699
of 1 Peter 125

00:40:51.699 --> 00:40:53.699
where it says,

00:40:53.699 --> 00:40:55.699
the saying of Jehovah

00:40:55.699 --> 00:41:01.219
and doers forever.

00:41:01.219 --> 00:41:03.219
The Belgium Branch Bible Museum

00:41:03.219 --> 00:41:05.219
of the many Bible museums

00:41:05.219 --> 00:41:07.219
at our branch offices around the world.

00:41:07.219 --> 00:41:09.219
If you're able,

00:41:09.219 --> 00:41:11.219
we hope you too will visit

00:41:11.219 --> 00:41:13.219
one of the Bible museums

00:41:13.219 --> 00:41:15.219
at a branch office close to you.

00:41:15.219 --> 00:41:17.219
There you'll learn more

00:41:17.219 --> 00:41:19.219
about the many honest-hearted people

00:41:19.219 --> 00:41:21.219
who've endured persecution

00:41:21.219 --> 00:41:23.219
to publish God's word

00:41:23.219 --> 00:41:25.219
the Bible.

00:41:25.219 --> 00:41:27.219
Welcoming new ones

00:41:27.219 --> 00:41:29.219
into the congregations brings us great joy.

00:41:29.219 --> 00:41:31.219
But how can we help them

00:41:31.219 --> 00:41:33.219
be firmly grounded

00:41:33.219 --> 00:41:35.219
in the truth?

00:41:35.219 --> 00:41:37.219
Let's listen to brother David Schaefer

00:41:37.219 --> 00:41:39.219
explain how

00:41:39.219 --> 00:41:42.500
in the following morning worship.

00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:44.500
So what does it

00:41:44.500 --> 00:41:46.500
take to help someone

00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:48.500
become firmly

00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:50.500
grounded in the truth?

00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:52.500
Let's focus on

00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:54.500
three things.

00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:56.500
Cooperating

00:41:56.500 --> 00:41:58.500
with divine direction.

00:41:58.500 --> 00:42:00.500
Loving the truth

00:42:00.500 --> 00:42:02.500
and loving people

00:42:02.500 --> 00:42:04.500
who love the truth.

00:42:04.500 --> 00:42:06.500
Let's go back to the year 50 CE

00:42:06.500 --> 00:42:08.500
and see what we can learn

00:42:08.500 --> 00:42:10.500
from Paul's ministry

00:42:10.500 --> 00:42:12.500
in Macedonia.

00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:14.500
Now Paul began his second

00:42:14.500 --> 00:42:16.500
missionary tour around 49 CE.

00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:18.500
In Listera,

00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:20.500
he and Silas found Timothy

00:42:20.500 --> 00:42:22.500
who Paul met on his first visit.

00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:24.500
But now Timothy

00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:26.500
is ready to accompany them

00:42:26.500 --> 00:42:28.500
on their journey.

00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:30.500
The map indicates no stops

00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:32.500
between Antioch

00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:34.500
and Troas.

00:42:34.500 --> 00:42:36.500
Just a swoop.

00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:38.500
What does it represent?

00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:40.500
Obedience

00:42:40.500 --> 00:42:42.500
to divine direction.

00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:44.500
Acts 16-8-10

00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:46.500
tells us

00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:48.500
the map indicates no stops

00:42:48.500 --> 00:42:50.500
between Antioch

00:42:50.500 --> 00:42:52.500
and Troas.

00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:54.500
Just a swoop.

00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:56.500
What does it represent?

00:42:56.500 --> 00:42:58.500
16-8-10 tells us

00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:00.500
that they tried to preach

00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:02.500
in Asia but were forbidden

00:43:02.500 --> 00:43:04.500
by Holy Spirit.

00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:06.500
Then they tried to preach

00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:08.500
in Bethinia,

00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:10.500
but again Jesus used the Holy Spirit

00:43:10.500 --> 00:43:12.500
to block them.

00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:14.500
So they turned west

00:43:14.500 --> 00:43:16.500
and went all the way to Troas

00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:18.500
on the coast.

00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:20.500
This is where they met up with Luke.

00:43:20.500 --> 00:43:22.500
And it's in Troas

00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:24.500
that they received divine direction

00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:26.500
and they wasted no time.

00:43:26.500 --> 00:43:28.500
They stepped onto a ship

00:43:28.500 --> 00:43:30.500
and they sailed over

00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:32.500
to Macedonia.

00:43:32.500 --> 00:43:34.500
It's now spring

00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:36.500
or early summer, 50 CE.

00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:38.500
Within a year,

00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:40.500
Paul formed congregations

00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:42.500
in Philippi,

00:43:42.500 --> 00:43:44.500
Thessalonica,

00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:46.500
and Berea,

00:43:46.500 --> 00:43:49.840
cities of Macedonia.

00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:51.840
But how did he do it?

00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:53.840
It's turned to Acts chapter 17

00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:55.840
for the truth.

00:43:55.840 --> 00:43:57.840
Shined through Acts chapter 17.

00:43:57.840 --> 00:44:02.559
I begin in verse 1.

00:44:02.559 --> 00:44:04.559
They now traveled through Amphilis

00:44:04.559 --> 00:44:06.559
and Apollonia

00:44:06.559 --> 00:44:08.559
and came to Thessalonica,

00:44:08.559 --> 00:44:10.559
where there was a synagogue

00:44:10.559 --> 00:44:12.559
of the Jews.

00:44:12.559 --> 00:44:14.559
So according to Paul's custom,

00:44:14.559 --> 00:44:16.559
he went inside to them

00:44:16.559 --> 00:44:18.559
and for three Sabbaths,

00:44:18.559 --> 00:44:20.559
he reasoned with them

00:44:20.559 --> 00:44:22.559
from the Scriptures,

00:44:22.559 --> 00:44:24.559
explaining and proving

00:44:24.559 --> 00:44:26.559
and to rise from the dead.

00:44:26.559 --> 00:44:28.559
Today's text.

00:44:28.559 --> 00:44:30.559
Well, here we see Paul

00:44:30.559 --> 00:44:32.559
in the synagogue,

00:44:32.559 --> 00:44:34.559
in Thessalonica.

00:44:34.559 --> 00:44:36.559
He has their attention.

00:44:36.559 --> 00:44:38.559
Why?

00:44:38.559 --> 00:44:40.559
He's using God's inspired word.

00:44:40.559 --> 00:44:42.559
Paul loves these truths.

00:44:42.559 --> 00:44:44.559
You can see it in his eyes.

00:44:44.559 --> 00:44:46.559
And he's forming an attachment

00:44:46.559 --> 00:44:48.559
for these new disciples.

00:44:48.559 --> 00:44:50.559
Is Jason

00:44:50.559 --> 00:44:52.559
in this picture?

00:44:52.559 --> 00:44:54.559
And as all those believers

00:44:54.559 --> 00:44:56.559
came from Thessalonica,

00:44:56.559 --> 00:44:58.559
but there's a problem.

00:44:58.559 --> 00:45:00.559
This was not Paul's synagogue,

00:45:00.559 --> 00:45:04.559
and the Jews were getting jealous.

00:45:04.559 --> 00:45:06.559
At Acts chapter 17 and verse 5,

00:45:06.559 --> 00:45:08.559
they began persecuting the new believers.

00:45:08.559 --> 00:45:10.559
Persecution.

00:45:10.559 --> 00:45:12.559
Paul had been opposed

00:45:12.559 --> 00:45:14.559
in Philippi,

00:45:14.559 --> 00:45:16.559
and now here in Thessalonica

00:45:16.559 --> 00:45:18.559
as he would be in Berea

00:45:18.559 --> 00:45:20.559
as well.

00:45:20.559 --> 00:45:22.559
In short order,

00:45:22.559 --> 00:45:24.559
he would be whisked away

00:45:24.559 --> 00:45:26.559
from Macedonia altogether.

00:45:26.559 --> 00:45:28.559
So to stabilize those new congregations,

00:45:28.559 --> 00:45:30.559
Paul left Luke

00:45:30.559 --> 00:45:32.559
in Philippi,

00:45:32.559 --> 00:45:34.559
Silas, in Berea,

00:45:34.559 --> 00:45:36.559
and Timothy,

00:45:36.559 --> 00:45:38.559
in Thessalonica.

00:45:38.559 --> 00:45:40.559
With trained representatives

00:45:40.559 --> 00:45:42.559
in each new congregation,

00:45:42.559 --> 00:45:44.559
could Paul now forget

00:45:44.559 --> 00:45:46.559
about Macedonia?

00:45:46.559 --> 00:45:48.559
Well, turn with me please

00:45:48.559 --> 00:45:50.559
in chapter 2 and verse 17.

00:45:50.559 --> 00:45:52.559
This is where we see

00:45:52.559 --> 00:45:54.559
Paul's love

00:45:54.559 --> 00:45:56.559
for the brothers.

00:45:56.559 --> 00:45:58.559
When Timothy came to Paul

00:45:58.559 --> 00:46:00.559
and Corinth and reported on the brothers in Thessalonica,

00:46:00.559 --> 00:46:02.559
it moved Paul to right.

00:46:02.559 --> 00:46:04.559
What was very likely

00:46:04.559 --> 00:46:06.559
his first inspired letter.

00:46:06.559 --> 00:46:08.559
And in this letter,

00:46:08.559 --> 00:46:10.559
he reveals where his heart was,

00:46:10.559 --> 00:46:12.559
first Thessalonians 2, 17.

00:46:12.559 --> 00:46:14.559
When we were

00:46:14.559 --> 00:46:16.559
separated,

00:46:16.559 --> 00:46:18.559
that's a powerful word.

00:46:18.559 --> 00:46:20.559
Associated with

00:46:20.559 --> 00:46:22.559
parents bereaved

00:46:22.559 --> 00:46:24.559
of their children,

00:46:24.559 --> 00:46:26.559
indicating the strong bond

00:46:26.559 --> 00:46:28.559
Paul felt for his spiritual family.

00:46:28.559 --> 00:46:30.559
When we were

00:46:30.559 --> 00:46:32.559
separated from you, brothers,

00:46:32.559 --> 00:46:34.559
for just a short time,

00:46:34.559 --> 00:46:36.559
in person,

00:46:36.559 --> 00:46:38.559
not in our hearts.

00:46:38.559 --> 00:46:40.559
Yes, Paul's heart

00:46:40.559 --> 00:46:42.559
was still with the congregation

00:46:42.559 --> 00:46:44.559
in Thessalonica.

00:46:44.559 --> 00:46:46.559
Every effort to see you in person

00:46:46.559 --> 00:46:48.559
for this reason,

00:46:48.559 --> 00:46:50.559
we wanted to come to you.

00:46:50.559 --> 00:46:52.559
Yes, I, Paul, tried,

00:46:52.559 --> 00:46:54.559
not just once, but twice.

00:46:54.559 --> 00:46:56.559
But yet,

00:46:56.559 --> 00:46:58.559
Satan cut across

00:46:58.559 --> 00:47:00.559
our path.

00:47:00.559 --> 00:47:02.559
Well, by this point,

00:47:02.559 --> 00:47:04.559
Paul had tried to go back twice,

00:47:04.559 --> 00:47:06.559
but his efforts were hindered.

00:47:06.559 --> 00:47:08.559
Would he mistake that

00:47:08.559 --> 00:47:10.559
as divine

00:47:10.559 --> 00:47:12.559
indication that his work

00:47:12.559 --> 00:47:14.559
in Thessalonica was finished?

00:47:14.559 --> 00:47:16.559
No.

00:47:16.559 --> 00:47:18.559
Paul knew the difference

00:47:18.559 --> 00:47:20.559
between divine direction

00:47:20.559 --> 00:47:22.559
and satanic opposition.

00:47:22.559 --> 00:47:24.559
And he did not give up.

00:47:24.559 --> 00:47:26.559
Impaled by Jehovah's Spirit,

00:47:26.559 --> 00:47:28.559
Paul wrote this letter.

00:47:28.559 --> 00:47:30.559
And in his love

00:47:30.559 --> 00:47:32.559
for the congregation,

00:47:32.559 --> 00:47:34.559
and with his love for the truth,

00:47:34.559 --> 00:47:36.559
he reminds the Thessalonians of their hope.

00:47:36.559 --> 00:47:38.559
In verse 19, he mentions Christ's presence.

00:47:38.559 --> 00:47:40.559
In this one brief letter,

00:47:40.559 --> 00:47:42.559
he talks about Christ's presence more

00:47:42.559 --> 00:47:44.559
than he would in all 13

00:47:44.559 --> 00:47:46.559
of his other inspired

00:47:46.559 --> 00:47:48.559
letters combined.

00:47:48.559 --> 00:47:50.559
Why?

00:47:50.559 --> 00:47:52.559
Because these

00:47:52.559 --> 00:47:54.559
persecuted Christians in Thessalonica

00:47:54.559 --> 00:47:56.559
needed to be reminded of their hope.

00:47:56.559 --> 00:47:58.559
They needed to wear it like a helmet

00:47:58.559 --> 00:48:00.559
and let it guard their thinking.

00:48:00.559 --> 00:48:02.559
And the encouragement worked.

00:48:02.559 --> 00:48:04.559
So,

00:48:04.559 --> 00:48:06.559
Satan used

00:48:06.559 --> 00:48:08.559
a different tactic.

00:48:08.559 --> 00:48:12.559
Speculators tried to twist Paul's word.

00:48:12.559 --> 00:48:14.559
Why did he mention Christ's presence so much?

00:48:14.559 --> 00:48:18.559
Might this prove that the presence has already begun?

00:48:18.559 --> 00:48:20.559
Possibly there was even a letter wrongly attributed

00:48:20.559 --> 00:48:22.559
to Paul that was being interpreted to mean

00:48:22.559 --> 00:48:24.559
that the day of Jehovah had arrived.

00:48:24.559 --> 00:48:28.559
Well, what could Paul do about this?

00:48:28.559 --> 00:48:30.559
He wrote his second

00:48:30.559 --> 00:48:32.559
inspired letter.

00:48:32.559 --> 00:48:34.559
In it, he admonished the brothers

00:48:34.559 --> 00:48:36.559
not to be quickly shaken from their reason

00:48:36.559 --> 00:48:38.559
because Jehovah's Day would not come.

00:48:38.559 --> 00:48:40.559
Unless

00:48:40.559 --> 00:48:44.559
the apostasy comes first.

00:48:44.559 --> 00:48:46.559
The

00:48:46.559 --> 00:48:48.559
apostasy.

00:48:48.559 --> 00:48:50.559
Those words

00:48:50.559 --> 00:48:52.559
completely harmonized

00:48:52.559 --> 00:48:54.559
with Jesus' illustration about the wheat

00:48:54.559 --> 00:48:56.559
and the weeds.

00:48:56.559 --> 00:48:58.559
A prophecy recorded in Matthew's Gospel,

00:48:58.559 --> 00:49:00.559
which had been in circulation

00:49:00.559 --> 00:49:02.559
for nearly 10 years

00:49:02.559 --> 00:49:04.559
when Paul

00:49:04.559 --> 00:49:06.559
was in Thessalonians.

00:49:06.559 --> 00:49:08.559
It's also in second

00:49:08.559 --> 00:49:10.559
Thessalonians that we learn

00:49:10.559 --> 00:49:12.559
that this apostasy would eventually

00:49:12.559 --> 00:49:14.559
set in

00:49:14.559 --> 00:49:16.559
because people did not

00:49:16.559 --> 00:49:18.559
accept

00:49:18.559 --> 00:49:20.559
the love

00:49:20.559 --> 00:49:22.559
of the truth.

00:49:22.559 --> 00:49:24.559
Meanwhile, though, Paul and the other apostles

00:49:24.559 --> 00:49:26.559
would act as a restraint

00:49:26.559 --> 00:49:28.559
against apostasy by fostering love

00:49:28.559 --> 00:49:30.559
for the truth.

00:49:30.559 --> 00:49:32.559
Yes, by Paul's example

00:49:32.559 --> 00:49:34.559
he was stating

00:49:34.559 --> 00:49:36.559
on the scriptures

00:49:36.559 --> 00:49:38.559
reasoning

00:49:38.559 --> 00:49:40.559
from them

00:49:40.559 --> 00:49:42.559
explaining them

00:49:42.559 --> 00:49:44.559
and proving

00:49:44.559 --> 00:49:46.559
with references he equipped the brothers

00:49:46.559 --> 00:49:48.559
to withstand the opposition

00:49:48.559 --> 00:49:50.559
they would face.

00:49:50.559 --> 00:49:52.559
As it turns out, Paul did return

00:49:52.559 --> 00:49:54.559
to Macedonia

00:49:54.559 --> 00:49:56.559
two more times

00:49:56.559 --> 00:49:58.559
and what did he find?

00:49:58.559 --> 00:50:00.559
Strong congregations

00:50:00.559 --> 00:50:02.559
and the truth

00:50:02.559 --> 00:50:04.559
unselfish

00:50:04.559 --> 00:50:06.559
in their generosity

00:50:06.559 --> 00:50:08.559
giving even beyond their actual ability

00:50:08.559 --> 00:50:10.559
their example

00:50:10.559 --> 00:50:12.559
inspires Christians

00:50:12.559 --> 00:50:14.559
to this very day.

00:50:14.559 --> 00:50:16.559
So what does it take

00:50:16.559 --> 00:50:18.559
to help others

00:50:18.559 --> 00:50:20.559
become well-grounded

00:50:20.559 --> 00:50:22.559
in the truth?

00:50:22.559 --> 00:50:24.559
Persistence

00:50:24.559 --> 00:50:26.559
in obeying divine direction

00:50:26.559 --> 00:50:28.559
helping others

00:50:28.559 --> 00:50:30.559
and loving

00:50:30.559 --> 00:50:32.559
those who love

00:50:32.559 --> 00:50:34.559
the truth.

00:50:34.559 --> 00:50:36.559
Even when we're separated

00:50:36.559 --> 00:50:38.559
by circumstances

00:50:38.559 --> 00:50:40.559
remaining attached

00:50:40.559 --> 00:50:42.559
at heart, may we continue

00:50:42.559 --> 00:50:44.559
to follow this example

00:50:44.559 --> 00:50:46.559
of genuine love

00:50:46.559 --> 00:50:50.190
as we carry out our sacred

00:50:50.190 --> 00:50:52.190
service today.

00:50:52.190 --> 00:50:54.190
Given the world's

00:50:54.190 --> 00:50:56.190
self-centered attitude,

00:50:56.190 --> 00:50:58.190
we consider belonging

00:50:58.190 --> 00:51:00.190
to God.

00:51:00.190 --> 00:51:02.190
Speaking of gifts,

00:51:02.190 --> 00:51:04.190
we have a surprise for you.

00:51:04.190 --> 00:51:06.190
A preview of what

00:51:06.190 --> 00:51:08.190
will experience

00:51:08.190 --> 00:51:10.190
at our 2025 Pure Worship

00:51:10.190 --> 00:51:16.219
Regional Convention.

00:51:16.219 --> 00:51:18.219
Enjoy.

00:51:18.219 --> 00:51:20.219
People have a need to worship

00:51:20.219 --> 00:51:22.219
something.

00:51:22.219 --> 00:51:25.469
A higher power.

00:51:25.469 --> 00:51:32.239
Themselves.

00:51:32.239 --> 00:51:34.239
Other people.

00:51:34.239 --> 00:51:36.239
Money.

00:51:36.239 --> 00:51:37.239
But how should we fill this need?

00:51:37.239 --> 00:51:39.239
True worshipists

00:51:39.239 --> 00:51:41.239
must worship with spirit

00:51:41.239 --> 00:51:43.239
and truth.

00:51:43.239 --> 00:51:45.239
The 2025 Convention

00:51:45.239 --> 00:51:47.239
of Jehovah's Witnesses

00:51:47.239 --> 00:51:49.239
continues the new video series

00:51:49.239 --> 00:51:51.239
the Good News

00:51:51.239 --> 00:51:53.239
according to Jesus.

00:51:53.239 --> 00:51:55.239
Jesus alone is qualified

00:51:55.239 --> 00:51:57.239
to teach us how to worship God.

00:51:57.239 --> 00:51:59.239
The benefits are personal,

00:51:59.239 --> 00:52:07.849
immediate, and everlasting.

00:52:07.849 --> 00:52:09.849
We're certain you'll thoroughly

00:52:09.849 --> 00:52:11.849
have three days of learning

00:52:11.849 --> 00:52:13.849
what it means to give

00:52:13.849 --> 00:52:15.849
pure worship to Jehovah.

00:52:15.849 --> 00:52:17.849
In this month's program,

00:52:17.849 --> 00:52:19.849
we've seen how Jehovah's

00:52:19.849 --> 00:52:21.849
love is expressed

00:52:21.849 --> 00:52:23.849
through his gift of the Bible.

00:52:23.849 --> 00:52:25.849
We feel his love

00:52:25.849 --> 00:52:27.849
when we consider how he preserved

00:52:27.849 --> 00:52:29.849
his word from ancient times

00:52:29.849 --> 00:52:31.849
until our modern day.

00:52:31.849 --> 00:52:33.849
How he used humble people

00:52:33.849 --> 00:52:35.849
to restore his name

00:52:35.849 --> 00:52:37.849
and how its message

00:52:37.849 --> 00:52:39.849
to his life.

00:52:39.849 --> 00:52:41.849
This month's music video

00:52:41.849 --> 00:52:43.849
highlights that his word

00:52:43.849 --> 00:52:45.849
is filled with love.

00:53:49.619 --> 00:53:51.619
What's filled with love

00:53:51.619 --> 00:53:57.369
Jehovah's love

00:53:57.369 --> 00:54:10.469
Reminds me

00:54:10.469 --> 00:54:12.469
not to worry

00:54:12.469 --> 00:54:14.469
how the trial will never

00:54:14.469 --> 00:54:16.469
last.

00:54:16.469 --> 00:54:18.469
Gives me hope for the future

00:54:18.469 --> 00:54:22.469
helps me learn from the past.

00:54:22.469 --> 00:54:24.469
Your promise draws me

00:54:24.469 --> 00:54:26.469
close to you

00:54:26.469 --> 00:54:28.469
as you draw close to me

00:54:28.469 --> 00:54:30.469
and once again,

00:54:30.469 --> 00:54:32.469
I'm thankful

00:54:32.469 --> 00:54:34.469
that I can see

00:54:34.469 --> 00:54:36.469
like the dew there

00:54:36.469 --> 00:54:38.469
in the morning

00:54:38.469 --> 00:54:40.469
like the wolf is from the sun

00:54:40.469 --> 00:54:42.469
like the moon

00:54:42.469 --> 00:54:46.039
light on

00:54:46.039 --> 00:54:48.039
what is there for everyone

00:54:48.039 --> 00:54:50.039
like a pillow

00:54:50.039 --> 00:54:52.039
is for comfort

00:54:52.039 --> 00:54:54.039
so your words can

00:54:54.039 --> 00:54:56.039
comfortably

00:54:56.039 --> 00:54:58.039
as I meditate on this

00:54:58.039 --> 00:55:00.039
it's easy just to see

00:55:00.039 --> 00:55:02.039
it's filled with love

00:55:02.039 --> 00:55:07.750
Jehovah's love

00:55:07.750 --> 00:55:40.090
I'm stronger in

00:55:40.090 --> 00:55:46.440
much you

00:55:46.440 --> 00:55:50.070
like a letter from

00:55:50.070 --> 00:55:52.070
I'm reading every day

00:55:52.070 --> 00:55:54.070
as I turn the precious pages

00:55:54.070 --> 00:55:56.070
so many thoughts

00:55:56.070 --> 00:55:58.070
to come my way

00:55:58.070 --> 00:56:00.070
and every day

00:56:00.070 --> 00:56:02.070
that passes

00:56:02.070 --> 00:56:04.070
gives me reason to be

00:56:04.070 --> 00:56:06.070
sure

00:56:06.070 --> 00:56:09.739
with the things that I

00:56:09.739 --> 00:56:11.739
am

00:56:11.739 --> 00:56:13.739
in the morning

00:56:13.739 --> 00:56:15.739
like the warmth

00:56:15.739 --> 00:56:17.739
is from the sun

00:56:17.739 --> 00:56:21.300
like the moon light on

00:56:21.300 --> 00:56:23.300
is there for everyone

00:56:23.300 --> 00:56:25.300
like a pillow

00:56:25.300 --> 00:56:27.300
is for comfort

00:56:27.300 --> 00:56:29.300
so your words can

00:56:29.300 --> 00:56:31.300
comfortably

00:56:31.300 --> 00:56:33.300
as I meditate

00:56:33.300 --> 00:56:35.300
it's easy just to see

00:56:35.300 --> 00:56:37.300
it's filled with love

00:56:37.300 --> 00:56:43.909
Jehovah's love

00:56:43.909 --> 00:57:02.170
Our postcard this month

00:57:02.170 --> 00:57:04.170
to the beautiful country

00:57:04.170 --> 00:57:06.170
of Paraguay

00:57:06.170 --> 00:57:08.170
Paraguay is a landlocked country

00:57:08.170 --> 00:57:10.170
in the heart of South America

00:57:10.170 --> 00:57:12.170
with a population of about 7

00:57:12.170 --> 00:57:14.170
million

00:57:14.170 --> 00:57:16.170
the Paraguay river runs from north

00:57:16.170 --> 00:57:18.170
to south dividing the country

00:57:18.170 --> 00:57:20.170
the east is characterized

00:57:20.170 --> 00:57:22.170
by rolling hills

00:57:22.170 --> 00:57:24.170
fertile fields

00:57:24.170 --> 00:57:26.170
some of which have red

00:57:26.170 --> 00:57:28.170
soil and thick forests

00:57:28.170 --> 00:57:30.170
in contrast

00:57:30.170 --> 00:57:32.170
to the region

00:57:32.170 --> 00:57:34.170
has a sparse population

00:57:34.170 --> 00:57:36.170
coarse grass

00:57:36.170 --> 00:57:38.170
scrub forest

00:57:38.170 --> 00:57:40.170
vast swamps

00:57:40.170 --> 00:57:42.170
and diverse colorful

00:57:42.170 --> 00:57:44.170
tropical birds

00:57:44.170 --> 00:57:46.170
Paraguay has two

00:57:46.170 --> 00:57:48.170
official languages

00:57:48.170 --> 00:57:50.170
Spanish and Guani

00:57:50.170 --> 00:57:52.170
and when the two languages

00:57:52.170 --> 00:57:54.170
mix you get

00:57:54.170 --> 00:57:56.170
Jopara

00:57:56.170 --> 00:57:58.170
which is frequently used today

00:57:58.170 --> 00:58:00.170
Paraguay's theocratic history

00:58:00.170 --> 00:58:02.170
has been dragged

00:58:02.170 --> 00:58:04.170
randomly sent to his home

00:58:04.170 --> 00:58:06.170
from world headquarters

00:58:06.170 --> 00:58:08.170
This moved him to order studies

00:58:08.170 --> 00:58:10.170
in the scriptures

00:58:10.170 --> 00:58:12.170
In 1906

00:58:12.170 --> 00:58:14.170
he and his brother-in-law

00:58:14.170 --> 00:58:16.170
baptized each other

00:58:16.170 --> 00:58:18.170
becoming the first

00:58:18.170 --> 00:58:20.170
in Paraguay to accept Bible truth

00:58:20.170 --> 00:58:22.170
In 1924

00:58:22.170 --> 00:58:24.170
Juan Munois

00:58:24.170 --> 00:58:26.170
a faithful missionary

00:58:26.170 --> 00:58:28.170
from Spain

00:58:28.170 --> 00:58:29.170
arrived to spread the kingdom message

00:58:29.170 --> 00:58:32.170
including Paraguay.

00:58:32.170 --> 00:58:36.170
Then in 1934, brothers Martonfi,

00:58:36.170 --> 00:58:40.170
Coros, and Reibach entered the country

00:58:40.170 --> 00:58:43.170
despite the ongoing Chaco War.

00:58:43.170 --> 00:58:47.170
Their efforts paid off when the first congregation

00:58:47.170 --> 00:58:50.170
was formed five years later.

00:58:50.170 --> 00:58:54.170
Decades of political instability resulted in a decree

00:58:54.170 --> 00:58:58.170
revoking the organization's legal status

00:58:58.170 --> 00:59:01.170
in 1979.

00:59:01.170 --> 00:59:04.170
As a result, the brothers had to conduct meetings

00:59:04.170 --> 00:59:10.170
in small groups at private homes or in isolated areas.

00:59:10.170 --> 00:59:14.170
Fortunately, 12 years later in 1991,

00:59:14.170 --> 00:59:17.170
the organization was legally recognized

00:59:17.170 --> 00:59:20.170
after the fall of the military regime.

00:59:20.170 --> 00:59:24.170
Did the publishers dwindle during those years?

00:59:24.170 --> 00:59:28.170
Sadly, the number of publishers doubled in size.

00:59:28.170 --> 00:59:32.170
Today, there are over 11,000 publishers

00:59:32.170 --> 00:59:35.170
who conduct about 10,000 Bible studies

00:59:35.170 --> 00:59:40.170
and attend 183 congregations.

00:59:40.170 --> 00:59:42.170
In the western part of the country,

00:59:42.170 --> 00:59:48.170
we find the Philadelphia Espanol and Loma Plata Guarani congregations.

00:59:48.170 --> 00:59:52.170
The 95 publishers of these two congregations

00:59:52.170 --> 00:59:56.170
conduct an average of 155 Bible studies

00:59:56.170 --> 01:00:00.170
and preach in Spanish, Guarani,

01:00:00.170 --> 01:00:03.170
Low German, and Niva Clay.

01:00:03.170 --> 01:00:08.170
The Philadelphia Espanol and Loma Plata Guarani congregations

01:00:08.170 --> 01:00:10.170
send their love.

01:00:10.170 --> 01:00:14.170
We love you all very much.

01:00:14.170 --> 01:00:17.170
From the world headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses,

01:00:17.170 --> 01:00:20.170
this is J.W. Broadcasting.
