00:00:04.209 --> 00:00:10.050
The reconstruction shown in this animation is partly based on the ruins of a first-century

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.769
synagogue in Gamla, and includes some of the features that were likely present in many

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:18.539
synagogues of that time.

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:19.539
1.

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:25.100
The front-or-best seats in the synagogue may have been located on or near the speaker's

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.420
platform.

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.420
2.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.460
The platform from which the scriptures would be read.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.380
The exact location of the platform may have varied from one synagogue to the next.

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.500
3.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.979
Seating along the wall may have been occupied by people with status in the community.

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:48.820
Others might have sat on mats on the floor.

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.619
The synagogue in Gamla seems to have had four rows of seats.

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:55.340
4.

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:02.929
An ark or chest in which sacred scrolls were kept may have been located on the back wall.

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:07.569
The seating arrangements in the synagogue were a constant reminder to those in attendance

00:01:07.569 --> 00:01:14.049
that some had greater status than others, a topic often debated by Jesus disciples.
