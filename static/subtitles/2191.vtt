00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:06.360
Imagine a world filled with peace.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:13.640
Free of suffering and abundance of food for all.

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:19.969
And life in perfect health.

00:00:19.969 --> 00:00:23.969
But how can this beautiful future be possible?

00:00:23.969 --> 00:00:27.969
Because of what Jesus did for us.

00:00:27.969 --> 00:00:32.539
He came to earth for a purpose.

00:00:32.539 --> 00:00:38.259
He gave His life for those He loved.

00:00:38.259 --> 00:00:47.829
The night before He died, Jesus asked that we commemorate His sacrifice.

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:49.829
He said,

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.829
Keep doing this in remembrance of Me.

00:00:52.829 --> 00:01:01.979
On the anniversary of His death, people around the world will gather to remember Him.

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:08.980
Jehovah's Witnesses invite you and your family to attend the memorial of Jesus' death.

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:13.980
At that meeting, you will find out why His sacrifice was so important.

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:18.980
And how His promises affect you.

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:27.980
