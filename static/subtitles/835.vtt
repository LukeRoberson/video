00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:09.539
When you think of your brain, view it as a mox that contains all sorts of information.

00:00:09.539 --> 00:00:12.099
Good and bad.

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:20.179
When you think of your heart, view it as a bottle that contains only good information.

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:28.859
Now listen to this vintage old 1950s joy-diswashing liquid soap commercial.

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:34.619
Joy in a bottle beats anything in a box.

00:00:34.619 --> 00:00:42.700
True joy from the heart beats a head full of knowledge.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.500
What about it?

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.859
Are you a joyful person?

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:50.299
What good is it?

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:57.780
Well the Bible says, a joyful heart makes for a cheerful countenance and it goes on to say

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:04.540
a heart that is joyful does good to the body.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.900
How does this work?

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:14.939
At times your heart will make you smile when your body is in pain.

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:22.260
For example, you pass another person and he or she says, how are you?

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.260
You smile and say, good.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:34.379
Your back, feet and legs are killing you but your heart won't let you give a negative

00:01:34.379 --> 00:01:37.180
answer.

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.819
There are other more important reasons to be joyful.

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:47.739
Here's one, Jehovah is a joyful person.

00:01:47.739 --> 00:01:55.099
At 1 Timothy chapter 1 and verse 11, he is called the happy God.

00:01:55.099 --> 00:02:00.540
Now Sinan is the joyful God.

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.219
He rejoices in his work.

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:05.620
Well, how do we know that?

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:16.300
Well look at the 104th Psalm and verse 31, the glory of Jehovah will last forever.

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.819
Jehovah will rejoice in his works.

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:25.300
Jehovah will rejoice in his work.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:32.780
Sinanians are having joy or delight in his works.

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:38.219
Now secondly, Jesus too is a happy worker.

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:48.900
At 1 Timothy chapter 6 and verse 14 and 15, he's called the happy potentate.

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:54.900
Potentate is a powerful ruler, yet he is happy.

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:00.539
It was prophesied of him at Psalm 40, verse 8.

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:08.550
To do your will, oh my God is my delight.

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:14.030
Now this means to please greatly.

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:22.310
According to John chapter 4 and verse 34, the doing of God's work was food for him.

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.629
It energized him and sustained him.

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:33.879
Doing God's will was like butter on his bread and milk in his glass.

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:39.740
Jehovah wants us to rejoice in our work.

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:47.580
Come with me please, Ecclesiastes chapter 5 and verse 19.

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:55.020
Also when the true God gives a man riches and material possessions along with the ability

00:03:55.020 --> 00:04:04.819
to enjoy them, he should take his reward and rejoice in his hard work.

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:08.620
This is the gift of God.

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:19.500
Bless wives and mothers, rejoice in your work, husbands and fathers, rejoice in your work,

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:32.420
single men and women, rejoice in your work, widows and whittlers, rejoice in your work.

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:39.420
Oh folks, rejoice in whatever you're able to do, just call it work.

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:45.790
Jehovah wants us to be joyful.

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:50.910
Deuteronomy chapter 16 and verse 15 comments this way.

00:04:50.910 --> 00:05:00.990
Jehovah your God will bless all that you do and you will become nothing but joyful.

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:04.589
The best fathers are happy fathers.

00:05:04.589 --> 00:05:08.350
The best husbands are happy husbands.

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:12.670
The best mothers are happy mothers.

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:15.790
The best children are obedient children.

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:22.379
Oops, I mean our happy children.

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:26.540
Singing up building songs produces joy.

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:30.379
Levite males sang at the temple.

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:37.500
However, other singers and men and women are spoken of and scripture.

00:05:37.579 --> 00:05:41.579
At Acts 16, verse 25, it says,

00:05:41.579 --> 00:05:49.579
but about the middle of the night, Paul and Silas were praying and praising God with song,

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:52.540
and the prisoners were listening to them.

00:05:54.459 --> 00:05:56.620
Slaves used to sing while working.

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:02.939
They did this to pass the time and lift their spirits to the highest joy.

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:06.379
They sang out their struggle,

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:17.980
weariness, loneliness, sorrow, hope, and determination for a better life.

00:06:19.899 --> 00:06:21.740
You can sing in the shower.

00:06:23.949 --> 00:06:25.470
Just make sure no one's listening.

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:28.350
Count your blessings.

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:32.430
Beath in the joy that they bring you.

00:06:35.279 --> 00:06:38.079
Joy is an aspect of God's Holy Spirit.

00:06:40.209 --> 00:06:43.889
It is the second of the nine aspects,

00:06:44.529 --> 00:06:48.290
mission and Galatians chapter 5 and verse 22.

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:54.610
Pray daily for God's Holy Spirit to be with you in your life.

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:01.779
Read with me, Daniel, chapter 6 and verses 10 and 11.

00:07:02.819 --> 00:07:08.980
But as soon as Daniel knew that the decree had been signed, he went to his house,

00:07:10.259 --> 00:07:16.180
which had the windows of his roof chamber open towards Jerusalem.

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:26.259
And three times a day, he got down on his knees and prayed and offered

00:07:26.259 --> 00:07:33.139
praise before his God, as he had regularly done prior to this.

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:44.899
At that time, those men burst in and found Daniel petitioning and pleading for a favor before

00:07:44.899 --> 00:07:54.180
his God. My wife, Gloria, and I used to get down on our knees to pray before going to bed.

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:59.220
Now that we're old, we just sit on the side of the bed and pray.

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:02.019
If we get down, we can't get up.

00:08:02.019 --> 00:08:08.060
Keep in mind that prayer will produce in you joy.

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:11.250
You're not alone.

00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:13.810
Jehovah is with you.

00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:17.569
He is never far away.

00:08:17.569 --> 00:08:23.410
At Acts 1727, Paul told some in Athens,

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:28.129
he is not far off from each one of us.

00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:36.850
He can see you and hear you from heaven, wherever heaven is located.

00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:43.009
Never should we feel that we are alone.

00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:51.009
Each minute of every day, Jehovah is right beside us,

00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:55.649
looking for opportunities to help us.

00:08:57.730 --> 00:08:58.929
Talk to him regularly.

00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:02.289
Ask him to give you joy.

00:09:05.309 --> 00:09:06.830
Angels two are joyful.

00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:12.029
Luke chapter 15, verse 10 says that they're joyful.

00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:14.429
Please look at it as we read it.

00:09:15.549 --> 00:09:23.070
In the same way, I tell you, joy arises among the angels of God

00:09:23.789 --> 00:09:26.350
over one sinner who repents.

00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:28.669
What do you think?

00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:31.710
Are you a joyful person?

00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:35.950
Try to remember the box.

00:09:37.549 --> 00:09:41.710
Put your mind to it and the bottle.

00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:45.149
Put your heart into it.

00:09:47.309 --> 00:09:51.470
Copy as best you can those who are joyful.

00:09:52.429 --> 00:10:01.070
Jehovah, Jesus, the angels, your spiritual brothers and sisters.

00:10:02.509 --> 00:10:11.389
Pretty early for a joyful countenance, a warm smile does good to the body.

00:10:13.659 --> 00:10:16.539
One secular song makes this point.

00:10:16.539 --> 00:10:17.340
I won't sing it.

00:10:18.059 --> 00:10:18.940
I'll just say it.

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:24.080
Light up your face with gladness.

00:10:25.279 --> 00:10:28.639
Hide every trace of sadness.

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:38.879
Although a tear may be ever so near, that's the time you must keep on trying.

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:40.879
Smile.

00:10:41.679 --> 00:10:43.279
What's the use of crying?

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:50.879
You'll find that life is still worthwhile if you just smile.

00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:57.889
If you are a joyful person, thank Jehovah.

00:11:00.129 --> 00:11:04.370
If you are lacking joy, work on being more joyful.

00:11:05.649 --> 00:11:13.250
Remember, Jehovah wants you to be nothing but joyful.

00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:23.250
Let's make it our aim to please him with joy.
