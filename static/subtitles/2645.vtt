00:00:01.649 --> 00:00:22.910
We are naturally drawn to it, whether it is epic or subtle, artistic beauty captivates

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:24.710
us.

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:30.030
Sometimes, it astonishes us in unexpected places.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:37.909
For example, sea slugs sport bold colors that may ward off potential predators.

00:00:37.909 --> 00:00:50.229
But to us, these colors form artistic arrangements of stunning beauty.

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:58.229
Chameleons are known for their ability to alter their coloring, sometimes to warn.

00:00:58.229 --> 00:01:09.530
But at other times, to attract the eyes of a potential mate, some unrelated animals

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:15.930
seem to have gone to the same artistic school, as in the case of the peacock spider.

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:31.879
And its namesake, unlike a static painting, many animals use motion to extend their arrangements

00:01:31.879 --> 00:01:36.599
of color, texture, and form.

00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:43.060
Few birds can match the flamboyance of male birds of paradise.

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:48.379
Mating pairs of western grieves take artistic performance a step further.

00:01:48.379 --> 00:01:56.840
They put on intricately timed and precisely executed dances.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:07.349
The ultimate water ballet.

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:14.110
Male bower birds show an almost artistic sensibility by arranging material from their environment,

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:34.509
in a manner we happen to find aesthetically appealing.

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:40.270
Another animal that displays what resembles a creative impulse, assembles an exhibition

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:47.250
of immense scale when compared to its size.

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:53.689
The white-spotted pufferfish sculpts an intricate pattern on the seafloor sand.

00:02:53.689 --> 00:03:04.860
That we find beautiful.

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:15.050
The male that labors on this underwater installation hopes that the male will take note and approve.

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:18.020
What do you think?

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:22.979
Did the artistry we see in animals simply evolve?

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:24.460
Or was it designed?
