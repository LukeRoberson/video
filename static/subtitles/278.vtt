00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:07.910
As a family we have always served Jehovah together, but something was changing in my husband.

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:15.769
He said he was just burned out, but he started to miss all of the meetings.

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:27.260
I couldn't believe I was doing this by myself.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:01:02.210
The elder stopped by to encourage him, but he didn't change.

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:09.599
He stopped taking the lead spiritually.

00:01:09.599 --> 00:01:20.760
I was getting more and more upset.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:33.969
I tried to remind him of his responsibilities as a spiritual head, and what he should be doing.

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:42.019
But the more I said, the worse things got, and it drove him further away.

00:01:42.019 --> 00:01:54.620
I didn't know what to do.

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:59.409
I was only seeing my own struggles.

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:18.460
I didn't see his.

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:22.710
After the meeting, the elders encouraged me.

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.710
They shared with me first Peter 3-1 which says,

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:33.710
If any or not obedient to the word, they may be one without a word through the conduct of their wives.

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.250
I could see there was another way to handle this situation.

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.250
My attitude and actions can have a strong effect on my husband,

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:51.689
and showing empathy and compassion goes a long way, even more than words.

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:54.689
I thought about the Bible example of Abigail.

00:02:54.689 --> 00:03:01.469
Her husband, Nebel, was a worthless man.

00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:13.719
But Abigail was so patient.

00:03:13.719 --> 00:03:25.099
My husband was no Nebel.

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:27.099
My husband was nothing like that.

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:32.620
That night we had a good talk.

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:46.460
I allowed him to express his feelings, and I just listened.

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:52.150
He was under more pressure than I realized.

00:03:52.150 --> 00:04:01.900
I told him not to feel any pressure from me, and to come back when he's ready.

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:09.680
I assured him that the kids and I love him very much.

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.680
That assurance went a long way.

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:19.490
Everyone was feeling better.

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:39.810
Though it took some time, things started changing for the better.

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:54.860
My attitude and support went so much farther than any words ever could.

00:04:54.860 --> 00:05:19.139
When we apply Bible principles, we don't always know what blessings may come about.

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:42.819
I am forever thankful for Jehovah's guidance.
