00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:08.689
This is a proclamation or a declaration by a group of Levites. It was done. They made this proclamation

00:00:08.689 --> 00:00:16.929
or really a prayer to Jehovah after the wall around Jerusalem had been rebuilt back in 455 BCE.

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:25.730
And this is what was said. You are Jehovah, the true God, who chose Abraham and brought him out

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:33.409
of Ur of the Caldians and gave him the name Abraham. You found his heart faithful before you,

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:40.369
so you made a covenant with him to give him the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites,

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:47.649
the Parasites, the Jebiusites, and the Gurgishites. Then it says, to give it to his offspring,

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:56.450
and you kept your promises because you are righteous. And that's interesting that last statement,

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:03.250
how is righteousness or Jehovah's righteousness connected to Israel becoming his chosen people?

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:11.409
They didn't, as a people, really merit it or deserve it, but the point is Jehovah honored

00:01:12.209 --> 00:01:19.650
his promise to Abraham. And that's why Jehovah is declared righteous by the Levites. They

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.650
recognized that it was due to a promise made to their forefather that they were chosen by God as

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:32.609
his nation, his people, and that he gave them the promised land. But the thing is that the idea

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:37.730
of carrying out your words, that latter part there, or the second half of the scripture, and you

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:43.890
proceeded to carry out your words because you are righteous. And that's what people do, people

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:51.730
who are righteous, who have self-respect and who honor their promises. And Jehovah God expects us

00:01:52.849 --> 00:01:58.769
to always be true to our word, to honor our promises. Now, that's not easy to do. Sometimes

00:01:58.769 --> 00:02:04.769
we'll find ourselves in a situation where it may be quite difficult to follow through and honor

00:02:04.769 --> 00:02:10.610
our word. But consider what Jesus said. Remember the scripture at Matthew 5, 37.

00:02:12.289 --> 00:02:18.289
Just let your word yes, mean yes. You're no, no. But then that interesting addition

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:25.250
for what goes beyond these is from the wicked one. But we know who the wicked one is. It's Satan

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:32.449
the devil. And his goals were deception and disruption. Satan had no intention of fulfilling what

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:37.729
he promised, Eve. In fact, he was incapable. He couldn't fulfill it. He told her, you will not die.

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:45.250
That was a bald lie right from the beginning. And he was unable to comply with what he said.

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.889
And isn't that true? There are people like that today. They'll tell you things. They'll promise

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:58.289
things. But they have no intention of fulfilling them. And those who do that are under the influence

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:05.009
of Satan the devil. There are things that we say yes to. There are promises that we make that we

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:14.129
don't want to break. And foremost is our our vow, our promise, our dedication to serve Jehovah forever.

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:20.689
We say yes three times. The watchtower pointed that out. It was interesting. We say yes when we

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:27.250
are interviewed by an elder to become an unbaptized publisher. We say yes, I want to be a Jehovah's

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:35.330
witness. And then we say yes again when we go over the questions for baptism that we've dedicated

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:41.009
our life to Jehovah and we want to serve him. We believe what the Scriptures teach. We want to

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:47.009
give our life to our God. And then the third time we say yes when we're at the assembly, usually it's

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:54.930
an assembly where the baptism talk is given and we answer the questions and say yes. And we make

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:00.689
a public declaration of our dedication to Jehovah God. So we put our hand to the plow.

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:09.969
We don't want to take our hand off the plow. We promised to fulfill our dedication vow, our promise

00:04:09.969 --> 00:04:15.250
in this regard. And really that helps make us righteous in a sense, not self-righteous. That's

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:20.610
disgusting to God. But righteous in that we're we have self-respect. We're honoring our word. We want to

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:27.170
honor our great God, Jehovah. There's another yes that we say that we want to be loyal to.

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:34.610
That's the yes when we take the marriage vow. They should not be broken. The marriage vow is,

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:42.529
it's interesting about vows. Usually vows are vows require us to do something. It's not that we

00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:47.569
get something when we make a vow. But usually if we make a vow it's because we're going to do

00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:53.569
something and that's the way it is with the marriage vow. It's to do things, to obey, to love,

00:04:53.569 --> 00:04:59.730
to cherish, for a wife it's to respect deeply. But the marriage vow has more to do with giving

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:06.050
than it has to do with receiving. And for those of us who are married don't we appreciate the

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:12.769
good effect it has on us to recognize that this arrangement, the marital arrangement is from Jehovah.

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:19.009
What a good thing that is it makes it so much more powerful to have success in our marriage. We're

00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:27.009
more determined to honor our marriage arrangement. And there's something else too. The binding power

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:32.689
of our individual spiritual relationship with Jehovah plays a vital role in our marriage because

00:05:32.689 --> 00:05:41.810
we don't just see our mate. We see Jehovah. This is his arrangement. And we honor Jehovah. We honor

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:48.290
our word to him before him. Then we're going to work very hard to make a success of our marriage.

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:55.410
And as the years go by we find genuine pleasure in our marital relationship. As time goes on it

00:05:55.410 --> 00:06:00.930
gets better. Some people just put up with one another in a marital arrangement. That's not what

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:09.170
Jehovah wants. Jehovah wants us to have a genuine friendship, intimate friendship with our mate

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:16.129
and to genuinely enjoy each other. There's a traditional maxim that says a man

00:06:17.089 --> 00:06:23.170
is as good as his word. Doesn't that tie in well with what we're discussing this morning?

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:28.529
Jehovah he certainly was faithful to his word. It makes me think of a brother that I know

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:36.129
he's a contractor and consort him a group of investors got together and they wanted him to

00:06:36.129 --> 00:06:44.050
run their company for them. And so he met with them and he laid it out before them very,

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:51.410
very straight. He said, look, he said, I live by certain Bible principles. I'm one of Jehovah's

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:58.850
witnesses. So I want you to know at the outset that I will not take advantage of the client.

00:06:59.649 --> 00:07:07.410
I will not cheat the workers. I will be 100% honest in everything I do. I will not use inferior

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:13.089
material. I'm going to follow the contract and do exactly as I should do. Now if you can live

00:07:13.089 --> 00:07:20.050
with that I'll take the job. Well they said fine, fine, we want you. That's why we've approached

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:25.490
you. But a little time went by and a couple of the investors said, you know we can make more money

00:07:25.569 --> 00:07:29.970
though. If you would cut a few corners here and there and the brother then got together with all

00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:34.689
of them and he reminded them, look, I told you at the outset where I stand on these things. Now

00:07:34.689 --> 00:07:39.410
if you can't live with me being 100% honest in my dealings with all of these things,

00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:44.529
then I'm leaving. I don't need the job. Well, of course they rallied then and they said, oh no,

00:07:44.529 --> 00:07:48.850
no, please because they had an honest man. After all, if he wouldn't cheat the client, if he wouldn't

00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:54.050
deal harshly or wrongly with the employees, he certainly isn't going to cheat the investors

00:07:54.769 --> 00:07:59.730
so what a beautiful thing. Being a man of one's word and following through it brings

00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:04.850
honor to Jehovah and doesn't it make us happy when we hear experiences like that of brothers who

00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:10.129
are firm and stand up. They're not afraid to stand firm for what they know is right. They're people

00:08:10.129 --> 00:08:19.730
of their word and Jehovah undoubtedly blesses them.
