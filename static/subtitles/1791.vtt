00:00:01.389 --> 00:00:08.990
Where the Eric Frost was a young man in Germany who said a good example in making wise decisions early in life

00:00:09.669 --> 00:00:11.669
He was born in

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.309
1910 baptized twenty-three years later and entered the full-time ministry in 1928

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:24.870
Not long after he was put in charge of the underground work of the persecuted witnesses of Jehovah in Germany

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:30.670
Carrying well for that assignment for eight months until he was incarcerated

00:00:31.629 --> 00:00:38.070
In this archived audio recording you will hear the fascinating experience of how brother Frost

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.350
Composed a kingdom melody in the middle of Saxonhausen a Nazi concentration camp

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.950
I always had the desire to compose music

00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:56.780
We had the

00:00:57.179 --> 00:01:02.539
As everybody knows we had the hardest work and suffered the hardest in the concentration camps

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:09.780
We were starved the labor exceeded our strengths and the arrestment was often unbearable

00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:23.060
So as usual, I wanted to find a way to build up the brothers

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.859
We had such a fine unity there in the Saxonhausen camp

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:34.620
I felt moved to compose a song that we could sing together for our mutual encouragement

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:45.819
Every morning we marched to the construction side of a sewage plant in a Iranian book

00:01:49.019 --> 00:01:53.980
Our labor group consisted of about forty brothers under the strict watch of the SS

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:06.700
While marching my mind went back and forth and

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.500
Gradually a melody formed that's how the music was developed

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:24.419
But how could the verses enter the camp without being able to write them down?

00:02:25.419 --> 00:02:31.860
I found a few brothers who helped me. I repeated the first verse to one of them until he knew it by heart

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:35.699
Either while marching or while driving the wheelbarrow at work

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:41.900
I told the second verse to another brother still to others the third and the fourth

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:47.379
In the evening I asked each of the brothers to recite his verse

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.060
That's how the song came to life

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:57.780
In the mornings when the forty of us were marching through the streets of Iranian book we already failed worn out

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:04.500
When one started humming that melody the entire labor group trembled with excitement

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:11.379
We had to control ourselves to not break out loud singing that would have been dangerous of course

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:14.860
They would have brought us back to the camp and severely punished us

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:27.060
Shultlos in Kerqa, the freedom is needed

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:35.060
Shultend erheben, the enemies of the haught

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:41.060
They would have to regained us

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:49.060
She wants us to regained ourselves.

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:56.060
We, too, belong to every place.

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.060
Only our children,

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.060
come here.

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:10.060
Only he can assure us.

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:18.060
Only he can assure us.

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:24.060
As we sat together in the evenings and someone started humming that melody,

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.060
quite a number of us sang along.

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.060
And we rejoiced.

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.060
Our eyes were shining.

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:39.060
This gave us new courage and hope.

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.060
We also had evenings of worship, talks were given,

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.060
and we had copies of the watchtower that we studied together.

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:51.060
So we were able to have some real times of peace and special encouragement

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:56.060
and felt uplifted by that song.

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:03.060
We also had evenings of worship, talks were given,

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:10.060
and we had copies of the watchtower that we studied together.

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:17.060
We also had evenings of worship, talks were given,

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:24.439
and we had copies of the watchtower that we studied together.

00:05:24.439 --> 00:05:31.439
We also had evenings of worship, talks were given,

00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:37.439
and we had copies of the watchtower that we studied together.

00:05:37.439 --> 00:05:43.439
We also had evenings of worship, talks were given,

00:05:43.439 --> 00:05:49.439
and we had copies of the watchtower that we studied together.

00:05:49.439 --> 00:05:53.819
Brother Frost, who was one of the anointed,

00:05:53.819 --> 00:05:57.819
finished his earthly course in 1987.

00:05:57.819 --> 00:06:01.819
After World War II and nine years of imprisonment,

00:06:01.819 --> 00:06:06.819
he served as the overseer of our branch office in Germany for ten years.

00:06:06.819 --> 00:06:11.819
This was before the arrangement was instituted of having a branch committee oversee the work.

00:06:11.819 --> 00:06:18.129
The very descriptive paintings that you saw in this segment were painted by a brother

00:06:18.129 --> 00:06:24.129
who was imprisoned in a concentration camp similar to the one Brother Frost was in.

00:06:25.129 --> 00:06:28.129
And I'm sure you recognized the song.

00:06:28.129 --> 00:06:32.129
You can find it in our songbook, though the tune is a little different.

00:06:32.129 --> 00:06:36.129
When Brother Frost found out that his song had been included in it,

00:06:36.129 --> 00:06:38.129
he was overjoyed and said,

00:06:38.129 --> 00:06:44.129
my clumsy lyrics were transformed into three wonderful verses.

00:06:44.129 --> 00:06:47.129
If you turn to song 17 in your songbook,

00:06:47.129 --> 00:06:52.129
you'll find the song originally composed by Brother Frost forward,

00:06:52.129 --> 00:06:54.129
you witnesses.
