00:00:01.229 --> 00:00:05.230
The man Gideon is the Bible example we will consider.

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:11.230
But what is the challenge this talk intends to address?

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.230
Are you ready for this?

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.230
Differences between fellow Christians.

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.230
You might think, no, how can that be?

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.230
Jesus said the identify mark of his disciples

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.230
would be the love among themselves, not the differences.

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.230
And that is true.

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.230
In our Christian Brotherhood, we feel the love.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.229
Love is prominent, it is dominant.

00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:39.229
But as individuals, we are drenched in imperfection.

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:44.229
Differences will inevitably erupt.

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:47.229
James 3, 2, doesn't mention any words.

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:51.229
It says, we all all stumble many times.

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:53.229
Not constantly, not every day.

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:57.229
But it acknowledges that we make mistakes many times.

00:00:57.229 --> 00:01:00.229
A brother or sister may say something to hurt us.

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:03.229
Or maybe we push their emotional button with words,

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:05.230
or they push ours.

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:08.230
Usually it's not intentional.

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:10.230
Often it's a misunderstanding.

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.230
We or they say something in good faith.

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:17.230
One thinks that appropriate, the other does not.

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:20.230
Or possibly, what we said or did,

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:24.230
was perceived in a way that we could not even have imagined.

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:26.230
But it happened.

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:32.230
And now we must sow peace in order to reap peace.

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:37.230
And when we plant seeds, some germinate much faster than others.

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.230
In the opening talk of this symposium,

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:46.230
it acknowledges that a farmer trusts he will see results in due time.

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:51.700
If we find ourselves at odds with a fellow Christian,

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.700
the Bible example of Gideon can help us to sow and reap peace.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.700
Now Gideon was at war with the Midianites.

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.700
And he asked his fellow worshippers, the Ephraimites,

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.700
to help chase them down.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.699
Judges, chapter 8.

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:12.699
They had tremendous success.

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:14.699
We say, great.

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:17.699
But after the battle, the Ephraimites were offended.

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:19.699
They tried to pick a fight with Gideon.

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:23.699
They felt that Gideon did not call them into battle soon enough.

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:29.780
Judges 8.1.

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.780
Then the men of Ephraim said to him,

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.780
what have you done to us?

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.780
Why did you not call us when you went to fight against Midian?

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.780
And they quarreled bitterly with him?

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.780
Well, these are all armed fighting men.

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.780
If this difference of opinion was allowed to escalate,

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.780
it could go out of hand very quickly.

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.780
In fact, in this case, hand-to-hand combat might have ensued.

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.780
Instead, though, how did Gideon's so peace with words?

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.780
Let's read verses two and three.

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.780
Hey, Gideon said to them,

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.780
what have I done compared with you?

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.780
Are not the gleanings of Ephraim better than the great harvest

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.780
of Abysir?

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.780
It was into your hand that God gave Midian's princes Orab and Zeab.

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.780
And what have I done compared with you?

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.780
And notice, when he spoke this way, they calm down.

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.780
Now, in this case, the germination period was very short.

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.780
Gideon sowed peace with well-choes and words,

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.780
and he reaped peace in one conversation.

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.780
Now, in the following dramatization,

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.780
notice how a brother prevents a situation

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.780
from escalating into a confrontation.

00:03:52.780 --> 00:04:05.099
And you know how Jehovah's people are.

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:10.099
When there's a need, our brothers step up.

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:14.099
So even though we had a lot of work to do back then,

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:17.100
we always had willing workers.

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.100
So many workers that some started to feel

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.100
like they were being overlooked.

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.100
Hey, Ray, what's up?

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:34.379
Hey, Mad, I hear you're organizing the food distribution

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:36.379
for our congregation.

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:38.379
Yeah, try my best.

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:40.379
Yeah, well, can I give you a hand?

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:42.379
My truck's all ready to go.

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:45.379
We actually finished just loading up for the day,

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:47.379
so I think we're good.

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:50.379
But wow, yeah, thank you very much for offering.

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:54.379
Okay, when's the next run?

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:56.379
You know what, Ray, we're about to pull out right now.

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:58.379
Is it okay if I call you back?

00:04:58.379 --> 00:05:00.379
Yeah, yeah, sure.

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:08.180
Ray was such a hard worker.

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:11.180
More than most of us even realized.

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:16.779
He put his heart into every assignment.

00:05:16.779 --> 00:05:19.779
But when I told him we already had all the help we needed,

00:05:19.779 --> 00:05:22.779
it didn't go the way I helped.

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:27.889
Ray, I think you're muted.

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:31.889
So what you're saying is you don't think I'm qualified to help out?

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:33.889
No, no, we just...

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:36.889
We know how hard you're working caring for your mom.

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:39.889
Is Paul Thompson on your crew?

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:40.889
Yeah, but...

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:41.889
And Oliver Kagan.

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:43.889
Oliver's my assistant, yes.

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:45.889
So how does this work, man?

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:47.889
I mean, you just use your friends,

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:49.889
and you shut the rest of us out.

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:53.889
Don't you think I noticed how your brothers ignore me?

00:05:53.889 --> 00:06:01.269
Ray, how are you an apology?

00:06:01.269 --> 00:06:07.050
I'm so sorry.

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:11.519
I should have spoke with you about this right from the start.

00:06:11.519 --> 00:06:14.519
You're working so hard taking care of your mom.

00:06:14.519 --> 00:06:18.519
The last thing we wanted to do was make things harder for you.

00:06:18.519 --> 00:06:20.519
But even more than that,

00:06:20.519 --> 00:06:23.519
we didn't want to have to ask you to do something

00:06:23.519 --> 00:06:28.569
that would put you or your mother at higher risk.

00:06:28.569 --> 00:06:33.550
I know. I worry about that, too.

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:35.550
Your mom?

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:37.550
We wouldn't want anything to happen to her.

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:40.550
She's one of our congregation treasures.

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:42.550
I know.

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:45.550
And you're not so bad, either.

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:47.550
Seriously.

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:49.550
You're such a good example.

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:52.550
And think how Jehovah must feel

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:55.550
when he sees all that you're doing.

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:57.550
For us and for your mom.

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:01.470
Thank you.

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:03.470
That means a lot to me.

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:06.470
If something comes up that I can help with then,

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:09.470
even just a little, and I can do it from home.

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:19.899
Two good brothers.

00:07:19.899 --> 00:07:21.899
But due to imperfection,

00:07:21.899 --> 00:07:24.899
they were both looking at the exact same situation

00:07:24.899 --> 00:07:27.899
with two different perspectives.

00:07:27.899 --> 00:07:29.899
Matt was well intended

00:07:29.899 --> 00:07:32.899
in what he did for Ray.

00:07:32.899 --> 00:07:34.899
He realized he was caring for his early mother.

00:07:34.899 --> 00:07:36.899
He was trying to protect him.

00:07:36.899 --> 00:07:38.899
But Ray is offended.

00:07:38.899 --> 00:07:41.899
He even accused Matt of showing favoritism to his friends

00:07:41.899 --> 00:07:44.899
and ignoring others.

00:07:44.899 --> 00:07:47.899
Well, how did this calm down?

00:07:47.899 --> 00:07:49.899
Well, first of all, thankfully,

00:07:49.899 --> 00:07:52.899
Ray went directly to Matt

00:07:52.899 --> 00:07:55.899
and asked his feelings between the two of them alone.

00:07:55.899 --> 00:07:58.899
Well, what did that allow for a follow?

00:07:58.899 --> 00:08:01.899
Well, Matt now had the opportunity

00:08:01.899 --> 00:08:06.899
to absorb and understand Ray's concerns.

00:08:06.899 --> 00:08:09.899
What a blessing that was.

00:08:09.899 --> 00:08:12.899
And so what followed after that?

00:08:12.899 --> 00:08:15.899
Well, you remember when he grasped it,

00:08:15.899 --> 00:08:19.899
Matt paused and apologized.

00:08:19.899 --> 00:08:21.899
His words, like Gideon's,

00:08:21.899 --> 00:08:24.899
well spoken, calmed Ray down.

00:08:24.899 --> 00:08:27.899
It was a short germination period.

00:08:27.899 --> 00:08:30.899
He sowed and reaped peace in one conversation.

00:08:30.899 --> 00:08:33.899
Well, how can we imitate Gideon

00:08:33.899 --> 00:08:37.899
when there's future differences with fellow worshippers?

00:08:37.899 --> 00:08:40.899
Second Timothy 224.

00:08:40.899 --> 00:08:45.899
And recall when the men of Ephraim confronted Gideon,

00:08:45.899 --> 00:08:47.899
they were confrontational.

00:08:47.899 --> 00:08:48.899
They were upset.

00:08:48.899 --> 00:08:50.899
They were rattling their sabers.

00:08:50.899 --> 00:08:52.899
But here, Paul,

00:08:52.899 --> 00:08:57.899
in effect, summarizes for Christians, Gideon's demeanor.

00:08:57.899 --> 00:08:59.899
Second Timothy 224.

00:08:59.899 --> 00:09:04.370
For a slave of the Lord does not need to fight.

00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:06.370
You see, with words or swords.

00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:08.370
Instead, like Gideon, it says,

00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:12.370
but needs to be gentle toward all, qualified to teach.

00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:14.370
And notice this.

00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:17.370
Showing restraint when wrong.

00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:19.370
That is not easy to do,

00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:25.370
but showing restraint when wrong is a means of sowing peace.

00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:28.370
Now, if it's just a minor offense,

00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:30.370
we might ask ourselves,

00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:34.370
can I put up with this slight to avoid a confrontation?

00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:37.370
But of course, in the case with Ray,

00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:39.370
he felt hurt deeply.

00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:42.370
Matt realized the perspective was different,

00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:44.370
but you remember in hindsight,

00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:48.370
Matt admitted I should have talked to you first.

00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:52.370
With those words, he planted seeds of peace.

00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:55.370
Now, amazingly long before the first century,

00:09:55.370 --> 00:10:02.370
Gideon manifested later what became a Christian principle.

00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:04.370
At Philippians 2.3, it says,

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:08.370
with humility, consider others superior to you.

00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:12.710
Do you remember Gideon's exact expression?

00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:15.710
Twice he said,

00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:19.710
what have I done compared to you?

00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:25.710
His humility calmed the ephromites down instantly.

00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:27.710
So what can we do?

00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:32.710
Well, we can apologize for our contribution to the difference,

00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:36.710
even if the apology is done on the other person's terms.

00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:38.710
We can pray for him.

00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:40.710
We can give a sincere compliment.

00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:42.710
It's something kind for the person.

00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:44.710
And if we have a discussion,

00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:48.710
may our words be gracious and toned kindly.

00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:52.710
Now it would be nice of all the differences between Christians

00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:55.710
could have a short germination cycle.

00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:57.710
But due to circumstances,

00:10:57.710 --> 00:10:59.710
personalities,

00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:02.710
or the nature of the issue,

00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:05.710
that's not always possible.

00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:09.710
But may we each be determined to do our part

00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:11.710
of the whole piece,

00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:15.710
and like the farmer, expect peace in due time.

00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:17.710
And oh,

00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:22.710
how sweet restored peace truly is.

00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:27.059
And now, Brother Robert Lucioni,
