What can you do on a social network?

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:07.860
You can connect with people.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:11.330
A lot of people.

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:21.960
Share your photos, tell Joe, post your thoughts on, well, just about anything.

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:25.519
And see what all your friends are up to.

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:27.519
It's pretty easy.

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:29.519
And that's the problem.

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:33.020
Sometimes, it's a little too easy.

00:00:33.619 --> 00:00:40.020
You see, a social network may look harmless, but once you log in, watch out.

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.020
It could be a dangerous place.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.719
So if your parents allow you to have an account, you have to be smart.

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.719
Social network smart.

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.719
Follow the front page rule.

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:57.719
Don't post anything that you wouldn't want to see on the TV news.

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.719
Or the front page of the newspaper.

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.719
And that includes personal information.

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:10.719
Like your phone number, where you live, and where you go to school.

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:15.719
Never tell people when you're not home or when you're going on vacation.

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:17.719
It may seem harmless.

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:23.719
But that's exactly the kind of information thieves can use to break into your house,

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:26.719
or even steal your identity.

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:31.060
Now, let's look at your reputation.

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.060
Your photos and comments say a lot about you.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.060
So, if you made a fool of yourself, ask.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.060
Is this how I really want people to view me?

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.060
Not just now, but in the future.

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.060
Like at a job interview.

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:54.060
At Proverbs 221, the Bible says a good reputation is worth more than silver and gold.

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.060
Don't let that delete key fool you.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:05.400
Listing something on any social network is kind of like writing and permitting.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.400
Okay, so you're careful about what you share.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.400
Now think about who you're sharing it with.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.400
Who are your friends?

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.400
Some people have hundreds of online friends.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.400
Some have thousands.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.400
So you may think the more friends are better, right?

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.400
Actually, no.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.400
That kind of thinking can blow up in your face.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.400
You see, when you connect with online friends,

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:38.400
you're also indirectly connecting with their friends and their friends friends.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.400
That means you may find yourself seeing posts from people you don't even know.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.400
People whose morals and beliefs may be different from yours.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:52.400
They may use bad language, or post about things you know are wrong.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.400
Those just aren't the kind of friends you want to hang around with.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.400
Not even online.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.400
And there's another danger.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.400
At Psalm 264, the Bible warns about people who hide what they are.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:12.400
They pretend to be someone they're not and may seem super friendly.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.400
But they could be dangerous.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:22.580
So when it comes to friends, you need to be picky.

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:27.580
The safest friends online are ones you already know offline.

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:30.580
There's one more thing to think about.

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.580
It has to do with your time.

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.580
Checking out the latest posts can be addictive.

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.580
So let's set some limits.

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:45.530
And don't let your online life get in the way of real life.

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:50.530
You know, connecting with others online can be fun and safe.

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:56.949
As long as you look out for all the dangers.

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:59.949
So the next time you log in, be smart.

00:03:59.949 --> 00:04:01.949
Social network smart.
