00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:19.079
How thrilled we were at last year's annual meeting to receive a new publication, Enjoy Life Forever, an interactive Bible course.

00:00:19.079 --> 00:00:26.079
Already, many publishers are having success in conducting progressive studies using this new tool.

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:34.079
As you listen to experiences from around the world, note the evidence of Jehovah's blessing.

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:40.079
When they made the announcement of the new publication for me, it was just pure excitement.

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.079
Actually, I was so overjoyed that I kept going to the website around the time of the release,

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:50.079
and at times I would have been refreshed my browser a few times a day to see when it was out.

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:55.079
Having all the teaching methods right in our hands, what more can we ask for?

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:03.079
We're so excited that during this pandemic, Jehovah has given us something to energize our ministry.

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:11.079
When you heard that we would be using a new method for conducting studies, were you a bit hesitant?

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:18.079
A close attention to what experienced teachers are saying about the benefits of this approach.

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:28.079
Before, it wasn't uncommon to hear students start their comments with expressions like the paragraph says or as the book mentions, now it's not like that.

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:39.079
In the old way of teaching, it was a bit difficult for me to discern if my Bible students really understood what they were learning or if the truth reached their hearts.

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:45.079
I think I was using too many additional points to convey one idea and just explaining too much.

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:49.079
So, my Bible students would get even more confused.

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:55.079
With some well-educated people, the studies were in a sense too easy for them.

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:06.079
They found the answer very easily from the paragraph and were able to answer correctly, but it was very hard to know what they really thought about the matter.

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:14.080
With this new book, it seems like it is easier to see the person's genuine thoughts on the matter.

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:23.080
In the previous method, you would see the student looking at the book a lot, but that doesn't happen now.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:31.080
When you look at the student, you can tell he's thinking about the answer instead of looking for the answer.

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:38.080
They used to enjoy the Bible study in the past, but now they enjoy it much more.

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:44.080
Now, they are able to keep focused from the beginning to the end of our session.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:50.460
They feel motivated and closer to Jehovah.

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:56.460
To reach the heart of a Bible student, we need to understand what he's thinking and feeling.

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:01.460
How does the Enjoy Life Forever book help us to do that?

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:06.460
One of the things I love about it is how after we read the Bible verse,

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:10.460
there is the questions that follow it that are perfectly free for us.

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:19.460
It really engages our students' hearts and it helps them to understand the Bible teachings right away and helps us to see what's in their heart as well.

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:26.460
It lets the student express what is in his heart, which allows us to help him.

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:32.460
The first time I looked through this publication, I could already see how appealing its format is.

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:38.460
There were no lengthy paragraphs and it was prepared in a very interactive way.

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:43.460
With this new method, I definitely talk less. My students talk more.

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:50.460
And the one that starts it all off, the introduction video, it just makes everything fit together.

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:55.460
And one of the amazing things that it introduces right away is the prayer.

00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:03.460
Because often as a teacher, we didn't know exactly when to introduce prayer or how to do it, but the video doesn't for us.

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:07.460
There are some people who say the feature is very effective.

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:15.460
So when the student is able to answer the question and sometimes even add a scripture, I told them, you know, that could have been in the ministry.

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:25.769
Obviously, teachers are excited about the new book, but what impact is it having on their students?

00:04:25.769 --> 00:04:33.769
Bible students have been pleasantly surprised. I asked one student how they felt to be using this new publication.

00:04:33.769 --> 00:04:41.769
And the response was, why didn't we do this sooner? It's great. I'm a lot calmer.

00:04:41.769 --> 00:04:48.769
Another student told me that she was relieved to no longer have to find the answers, but rather express her thoughts and feelings.

00:04:49.769 --> 00:04:59.769
During our discussion of the dig deeper section in lesson two, my Bible student really appreciated the scriptures and the beautiful artwork.

00:04:59.769 --> 00:05:05.769
He said that he could already see himself in paradise enjoying the many promises of Jehovah.

00:05:05.769 --> 00:05:10.769
He said that our discussion made him feel Jehovah's love.

00:05:10.769 --> 00:05:16.769
With the students, they're not so overwhelmed with the new book when we asked them to prepare the lesson.

00:05:16.769 --> 00:05:22.769
With the Bible Teachbook, when we would ask them to prepare these paragraphs, it was like you asked them to go to the dentist.

00:05:22.769 --> 00:05:29.769
They just seemed so intimidated by it, but now they smile and they're like, okay, I can do that.

00:05:29.769 --> 00:05:39.769
One student in particular, he wrote in the gold box, because I want to share the points from this lesson with my friends and work colleagues within a week, and he did.

00:05:40.769 --> 00:05:47.769
One of the videos that was really effective was the one from lesson four, my search for the true God.

00:05:47.769 --> 00:05:58.769
It shows the experience of Sister Sotan Yuan. My students were deeply moved. They really felt Jehovah's love for them and wanted to speak with him.

00:05:58.769 --> 00:06:01.769
They felt motivated to pray.

00:06:02.769 --> 00:06:09.769
We were studying the first lesson with an 83-year-old lady when he came across Matthew chapter 7, verse 7.

00:06:09.769 --> 00:06:17.079
She read it in her own Bible, and at first, she didn't quite understand it.

00:06:17.079 --> 00:06:25.939
Then we pounded over the verse together with a question, and then all of a sudden she asked,

00:06:25.939 --> 00:06:36.939
Oh, does this verse mean that I should dig for the answers in the Bible myself? Instead of asking a priest, it was quite a special moment.

00:06:36.939 --> 00:06:48.939
The video for Learn to Enjoy Bible Reading was very helpful for one young man. After watching it, he set the goal of reading the Bible every day.

00:06:48.939 --> 00:06:55.939
With one Bible student, we had encouraged him to become an unbaptized publisher in the previous study book.

00:06:55.939 --> 00:07:03.939
And now when we were in lesson two of our new study, a publication, he expressed the desire to become an unbaptized publisher

00:07:03.939 --> 00:07:11.939
because he felt he could share one or two points from each lesson with his friends and others that he knew.

00:07:11.939 --> 00:07:15.939
And so now he's approved and is doing very well in the ministry.

00:07:15.939 --> 00:07:31.500
Thanks to this new book, I now conduct 15 Bible studies. The book helps them to maintain the desire and motivation to keep learning about Jehovah, his beautiful qualities, and the future that awaits us.

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:41.500
Clearly, our worldwide brotherhood is excited to use Enjoy Life Forever. What a tremendous gift from Jehovah.

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:50.500
And then of all the facets of our ministry, without a question, conducting a progressive Bible study is the most satisfying aspect.

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:54.500
And now we have the tool and the method to make it much easier.

00:07:54.500 --> 00:08:03.500
I'm very grateful for this tool. It really helps us to sense how close the governing body recognizes we are to the end.

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:10.500
But in no way feels like a rushed program. The heart is definitely being reached gently and lovingly.

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:13.500
And then that is what motivates quickly.

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:17.500
Try and introduce it as much as you can. Start those Bible studies.

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:21.500
And when you do, please invite me to join in on your new Bible study.

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:27.500
This book makes Bible teaching very simple and enjoyable.

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:32.500
And I am convinced that everyone who tries it will love it.

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:44.500
The new book Enjoy Life Forever shows clearly that the faith on the street slave has been, is, and will continue to give exactly what we need and exactly the right time.

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:54.500
This publication has the potential to help many more honest-hearted ones come to know and love our wonderful father, Jehovah.

00:08:54.500 --> 00:09:01.500
May he bless you and your Bible students as you put to use this new tool.
