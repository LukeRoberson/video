00:00:05.459 --> 00:00:10.460
My father was a self-made factory owner.

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:15.460
He started a business working with rubber and plastics.

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:19.460
Emily led a financially comfortable way of life.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:25.460
But in the middle of the 1970s, things started going badly with his work.

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.460
For this reason, he fell into a depression and he committed suicide.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.460
This was a great shock.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:39.759
I went to the wall and wrote the words, he lives.

00:00:39.759 --> 00:00:44.759
I didn't want to believe that from that day on, I wouldn't see my father again.

00:00:44.759 --> 00:00:54.259
At the age of about 10, I began to develop strong anti-religious tendencies.

00:00:54.259 --> 00:01:00.259
And later at the age of 17, I also expressed it by participating

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:05.260
in the most important incident of the student movement against the military junta

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:10.629
that was prevailing in Greece and ruling the country.

00:01:10.629 --> 00:01:14.629
I became a member of the Communist Party.

00:01:14.629 --> 00:01:19.629
I went to Santorini and started a business. I opened a bar.

00:01:19.629 --> 00:01:28.629
Of course, all this included unsavory things like immorality, drugs, and plenty of alcohol.

00:01:28.629 --> 00:01:32.629
A few months later, I left to study in Germany.

00:01:32.629 --> 00:01:35.629
It was the first time I met a brother engaging in street work.

00:01:35.629 --> 00:01:40.629
People would approach him and some would swear, some even spat at him.

00:01:40.629 --> 00:01:45.629
It impressed me immensely how he stood calmly and accepted this treatment.

00:01:45.629 --> 00:01:48.629
We had interesting conversations.

00:01:48.629 --> 00:01:54.629
My studies ended and I returned to Greece to take on the responsibility of the factory.

00:01:54.629 --> 00:02:02.629
When I finished my studies in Germany, I left with a sense of deep respect for Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:02:02.629 --> 00:02:09.460
The influence through my friends led me to go in the military.

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:13.460
And there I saw a huge amount of corruption.

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:21.460
The hope I had that we humans would be able to succeed without external help, without God, began to collapse.

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:28.460
And then the things I had heard from Jehovah's Witnesses suddenly came to my mind.

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:35.460
The same afternoon, I sought out a family friend, the mother of a childhood friend named Lily.

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:40.460
I said to her, please give me a Bible and some Bible study publications.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.460
Because I want to study it, I read everywhere.

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:48.460
And anything that I didn't understand, I wrote down in a notebook.

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:54.460
I got to the point in just a few days where I had written down 80 to 90 questions.

00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:01.460
Harry impressed me because every time I asked him a question, he gave me the answer from the Bible.

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:05.460
That convinced me that I had found the truth.

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:12.460
So in that moment, I decided to leave the military and to quit smoking.

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:17.460
A few months passed by where I was occupied mostly with the factory.

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:25.460
Until I recognized that for me to make progress in the truth, I had to sell my shares in the factory.

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:29.460
And on July 7, 1984, I was baptized.

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:39.460
The authorities, the police, the mayor, the health inspectors began to demand money so that I could keep the bar open.

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:48.250
I refused all the things they asked of me and so the war became harder.

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:55.250
Until one night, when I went to open the door to enter my home, I heard a tramping from behind.

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:01.250
I tried to turn and see, and as I turned, I was hitting the face.

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:09.539
During that time, when all of this was happening, my brother Dmitrius arrived.

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:12.539
As brothers, we never really had a relationship.

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:18.540
When he came to Santorini and began to talk to me and help me understand what was happening to me,

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:23.540
I realized that this was a different Dmitrius.

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:27.540
I said to him, I want us to start studying the Bible together.

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.540
I had the Bible with me almost everywhere I went so that I could read it.

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:37.540
I realized that Jehovah was helping me to understand what I was living for.

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:44.540
He was helping me to understand that I could have a real goal, a purpose and hope.

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:50.819
On the day of my baptism, I felt that I was drawing closer to Jehovah.

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:53.819
I felt like my smile went from ear to ear.

00:04:53.819 --> 00:05:00.389
And now with Lydia, I have the great joy of serving in the Romani territory.

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:05.060
We enjoy very nice Bible studies.

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:12.060
It is truly something that shows you Jehovah's love, interest and affection.

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:17.060
Things that I had felt many years ago when I studied with my brother.

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:22.060
Today, my brother and I love each other very much.

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:29.060
It is a relationship characterized by brotherly love as it is expressed in the Bible.

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:32.060
We are very close to each other.

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:35.060
This is really a change.

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:38.060
Now we are truly brothers.
