00:00:01.169 --> 00:00:08.169
A little deeper study helps you to draw close to Jehovah, the interactions that Jehovah has with its faithful servants.

00:00:08.169 --> 00:00:13.169
We think about them, we meditate on them, it actually becomes a personal matter.

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:20.170
Drawing close to God becomes personal, and then we can use that in our circumstances in life.

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:26.170
If we are dealing with a sickness or the illness of a mate, or even with a great tribulation in the offing,

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:31.170
how are we going to handle our relationship with Jehovah? How are we going to stay strong?

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:40.170
Well, we had this beautiful drama, O Jehovah, I trust in you, the Hezekiah drama that we had for our regional convention,

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.170
since that is still ringing very clearly in our minds and hearts.

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:53.170
Let's open our Bibles 2 of 2 Kings chapter 19. Let's review a few thoughts from the life of Hezekiah

00:00:53.170 --> 00:01:00.170
and that time period with Sinecorib, the King of Assyria, the attack on Jerusalem in the year 732,

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:08.170
and Isaiah's words too has a chia. Again, but with the focus of, how can I draw close to Jehovah God?

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:15.170
What can this account continue to teach me? So, chapter 19, let's start with verse 6.

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:22.170
Isaiah said to them, this is what you should say to your Lord, this is what Jehovah says.

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:30.170
Now, this was to Hezekiah. Do not be afraid, four words, but so powerful. Why?

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:37.170
Because positive assurance has a chia that Sinecorib will be defeated. Do not be afraid,

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:47.170
because I've heard all the things that Sinecorib has said and He's blasphemed me. Do not be afraid.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:55.170
Think about that. It engenders confidence. It engenders us to approach Jehovah God. He wants to help us.

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:02.170
He wanted to help Hezekiah. He saw his situation. Hezekiah was emerging as one of the greatest kings of all Israel.

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:12.169
He was beating the odds. He had an apostate father. And yet, Jehovah had his eye on Hezekiah and wanted to help him. Do not be afraid.

00:02:12.169 --> 00:02:21.169
You see, trusting in Jehovah's has a chia did is an act of worship. It's something that gets Jehovah's blessing.

00:02:21.169 --> 00:02:28.169
When Jehovah tells us, under our circumstances, it do not be afraid. I will help you. I want to help you.

00:02:28.169 --> 00:02:38.169
That helps us to be loyal to Him. We draw close to Him. Now, when we show loyalty to Jehovah, then He acts in loyalty toward us.

00:02:38.169 --> 00:02:45.169
There's an action. It's not passive. He acts in loyalty toward us. He gives us His Holy Spirit.

00:02:45.169 --> 00:02:51.169
He draws closer to us. We feel His support. We can sense that He has helped us.

00:02:51.169 --> 00:02:59.169
Our personal relationship with Jehovah becomes more keen. You see, and that's because Jehovah is telling us as a heavenly father,

00:02:59.169 --> 00:03:08.169
do not be afraid. He did that to Hezekiah, and He does it with us. It's part of drawing close to Him.

00:03:08.169 --> 00:03:17.169
Next, Hezekiah senses what really is important, and this is so valuable to you and me. Let's go now to verse 19.

00:03:17.169 --> 00:03:25.900
But now, Jehovah, our God, please save us out of His hand. Now, that's Sennacherib's hand. We know that.

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:33.900
So that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you alone are God, O Jehovah.

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:43.900
So, all the kingdoms of the earth. See, Hezekiah was interested in Jehovah's name, the sanctification of that name.

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:52.900
He was interested in the reputation of Jehovah God. Now, He didn't talk about Himself, but He just spoke about Jehovah God.

00:03:52.900 --> 00:04:01.900
And again, that's the lesson that we can learn. If we're going to draw close to Jehovah, we think about His reputation, His name.

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:08.900
We think about the issue of universal sovereignty. We think about what that kingdom is going to do to cleanse the earth.

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:15.900
Now, I know that oftentimes we think about our own suffering, and I need to get into the new world.

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.899
And we think about the relief that we're going to have. And that's of course important.

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:31.269
But the core issues, the greater issues, is Jehovah's name, proving the devil a liar, our loyalty at this time.

00:04:31.269 --> 00:04:34.269
This is what Jehovah is looking at. This is the real issue.

00:04:34.269 --> 00:04:43.269
Imagine, as the Great Tribulation approaches, how delightful, how exciting it's going to be, as we see even the sign of the Son of Man,

00:04:43.269 --> 00:04:53.269
there at Matthew 24 and verse 30, some supernatural demonstration display of Christ's kingly power, as Jehovah demonstrates His sovereignty.

00:04:53.269 --> 00:04:58.269
It's all the kingdoms of the earth must know that Jehovah is God.

00:04:58.269 --> 00:05:05.269
Again, thinking about these things really brings our attention to the important things in life.

00:05:05.269 --> 00:05:13.269
And it helps us to draw close to Jehovah God. Let's go a little bit further. Let's look at verse 28.

00:05:13.269 --> 00:05:19.269
Now here, Sinecorib is going to learn a big lesson we know.

00:05:19.269 --> 00:05:31.269
Verse 28, because your rage, now Jehovah is speaking to Sinecorib, of course, through Isaiah, but because your rage against me and your roaring have reached my ears,

00:05:31.269 --> 00:05:39.269
I'm going to put a hook in your nose and a bridle in your lips, and I'm going to lead you back to the way you came right back to Nineveh Sinecorib.

00:05:39.269 --> 00:05:46.269
You made a big mistake by planting yourself in the land that I gave my people. You made a big mistake. You shouldn't have done that.

00:05:46.269 --> 00:05:54.269
You're used to putting hooks and noses of people and bridles in their lips. Well, I'm going to put a hook in your nose and drag you right back, yank you back to Nineveh.

00:05:54.269 --> 00:06:04.269
I mean, this is encouraging. This helps us to see exactly what Jehovah God is going to do through this modern day of Syrian as they try to attack us in the near future.

00:06:04.269 --> 00:06:11.269
Whether it be the modern day of Syrian or God of May, God, the king of the north, the kings of the earth, they don't stand a chance.

00:06:11.269 --> 00:06:17.000
This helps us to draw close to Jehovah God.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:24.000
Now verse 29, imagine this time period as we saw through that beautiful drama, how are they going to eat?

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:32.000
What are they going to eat with the Assyrian invasion? It's not possible to have a harvest to sow seed. What would they do?

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Verse 29, and this will be a sign, a miraculous sign for you, Ezekiah, this year you will eat what grows on its own.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:56.000
So imagine that. Jehovah says, don't worry. From those spilled kernels from last year I'm going to have food shoot up from the old grain from last year.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:08.000
That's amazing, miraculous provision of food. And then notice it goes on and says, and in the second year you will eat grain that sprouts from that.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:19.000
So again, even in the second year, but what is even more interesting, according to Bible chronology, that second year would be a Sabbath year of the Jubilee cycle.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:29.000
And the Sabbath year of the Jubilee cycle, the faithful Jews would not be able to plant. They wouldn't sow seed. They would let the land lay dormant or let it rest.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:40.000
And Jehovah said, I'm still going to provide for you. And then of course it goes on and says, in the third year you can sow seed and reap a harvest.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:54.000
You see the faith it must have taken on the part of these faithful Jews at that time. Would they really trust that sufficient crops would be available for two years in a row without working their fields? How would you have felt?

00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:06.000
Maybe it was going through their minds. Well, we should maybe go to Senekirub. He's offering us food. He's offering us survival. Maybe we should surrender. This was portrayed in the drama so beautifully.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:23.000
So again, what's the big point for us? Jehovah wants to help us. And we draw close to Jehovah God, knowing that as the great tribulation even approaches, geographical location has no bearing on Jehovah rendering assistance to his people.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:35.000
But now is the time as we study these accounts, we draw close to Jehovah, we gain confidence trusting him, being loyal, knowing that he will loyally support us under any circumstances.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:45.000
So meditating on these accounts should help us to continue to stay loyal, not be afraid as God's enemies will not succeed.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:09:03.000
Keeping focused that all the kingdoms of the earth must know that Jehovah is God, and that his sovereignty will be the main issue in the universe, and that Jehovah's fatherly eye is upon us as we continue to draw close to God and serve him for an eternity.
