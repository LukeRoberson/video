At the Watchtower Educational Center in Paterson, New York, the 133rd Class of Gilead School approached the completion of their training.

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:19.579
It is the custom for the Bethel family to share a special meal and to benefit from personal expressions about Gilead from two of the students.

00:00:19.579 --> 00:00:30.579
Brother Mark Sanderson, serving as chairman for the noon program, made his first televised appearance to the Bethel family as a newly appointed member of the governing body.

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:42.579
There was excitement in the air as brother Ken Stovall, a Gilead staff member, began his interviews with sister Lydia Mumba from Zambia and brother Joshua Kandari from India.

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:47.579
Well now that you've been through the Gilead course, was it what you expected it to be?

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.579
We knew that Gilead would be an intense Bible education.

00:00:51.579 --> 00:01:01.579
But when we came here, we saw that this school had such a beautiful arrangement of helping us to get the main points from each book of the Bible.

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:12.579
I thought it was just like Gilead Jams starts you and just unlocks your thinking and your world of discovery so you can discover so much more.

00:01:12.579 --> 00:01:17.579
Is there a point that you learned that you want to apply personally?

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:24.579
I would say the whole course worked on me personally, but one point comes to my mind.

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:34.579
I have learned that when applying the fruitage of the spirit, often there is a point where we set our own limit, for example kindness.

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:40.579
Usually when we do something kind for someone, we feel they should show appreciation.

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:46.579
And if they don't show the appreciation we were expecting, naturally we stop.

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.579
And then it's like we've reached our limit.

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:56.579
Now brother Kandari, how did you benefit from this thorough study of the Bible?

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:06.579
One thing I benefited most was considering both the context and the extended application of the scriptures.

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:11.580
Were there any lessons that you felt would be of practical value for you?

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:21.580
One point of practical application that stood out for me and many of my classmate and that was humility.

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:31.580
We learn especially with regard to the view of our privileges that they don't equate spirituality.

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:37.580
And loss of a privilege does not necessarily indicate loss of spirituality or maturity.

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:49.580
At the conclusion of the delicious meal and heartwarming interviews, the Bethel family return to their assignments, joyfully anticipating the graduation program to follow on Saturday.
