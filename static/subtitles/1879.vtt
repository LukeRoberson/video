00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:08.019
They drove up in front of our car in a Jeep with tinted windows and blocked the road.

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:12.519
Several masked men with automatic weapons jumped out and shouted,

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:13.519
don't move.

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:18.519
They twisted my arms behind my back and pushed me up against the hood of my car.

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:22.519
This interview was filmed in July 2019.

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:27.519
Felix Mahamedev described his arrest and his life in the detention center,

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:29.519
where he spent almost a year.

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.520
At that time, no one imagined that just two months later,

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.520
a court would find him guilty of organizing extremist activity

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:47.060
and imprison him along with five fellow believers.

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:54.060
In December 2019, the Sarata Fregional Court dismissed the appeal filed by the witnesses

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.060
and upheld the verdict.

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:00.060
Early in February, five of the six convicted Jehovah's Witnesses

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:04.060
were sent to penal colony number one in Arinburg.

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:10.060
Upon their arrival on February 6, they were beaten by prison guards.

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:17.060
The guards forced them to their knees and started beating them with clubs and fists and kicking them.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:22.060
Felix was beaten the most, probably because he was smiling when they went in,

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.060
because he's always smiling.

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:30.060
Felix Mahamedev was diagnosed with a broken rib and a damaged lung and kidney.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.260
Alexei and Tatiana Budinchuk have two young children.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:47.260
The family lives in a small house and their main source of income comes from their small farm.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:53.260
But on June 12, 2018, the lives of the entire family suddenly changed

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:57.260
when a group of armed officers raided their home.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:02.260
I saw that someone wearing a mask and uniform went into the garage.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:09.259
A few seconds later, he came up the stairs, forced me to the floor and handcuffed me.

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.259
Afterwards, they took mom and dad away.

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:16.259
I was afraid that I might never see them again.

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:23.259
Eventually, Tatiana was released, but two days later, a court sentenced Alexei to a detention center.

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:28.259
Konstantin Bajanov and Felix Mahamedev were sent to the same detention center.

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:34.259
Three other witnesses were forced to sign a document agreeing not to leave their city of residence.

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:39.259
I spent a total of 11 months and eight days in the detention center.

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:47.259
Then, on May 20, 2019, we were released from there and were placed under different form of restriction,

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:49.259
abandoned certain activities.

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:57.259
In July 2019, the criminal trial against the six witnesses from the city of Saratav began.

00:02:58.259 --> 00:03:00.259
The charges read in black and white.

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:05.259
There are no victims, no harm whatsoever has been done to anyone.

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:12.259
An individual should be informed of the accusation against him, including specific details about the time and location.

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:15.259
But this document reads like this.

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:19.259
At an undetermined time, in an undetermined place,

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:27.259
after a certain date, somebody came up with the idea to create an organization whose activity was banned.

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:36.259
Eventually, all six witnesses were found guilty and sentenced to imprisonment from two to three and a half years.

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:42.259
The court decision proved to be a real test for their friends and relatives.

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:52.259
The wives of the six convicted witnesses from Saratav vowed to continue to support their husbands and to never renounce their faith in God.

00:03:53.259 --> 00:04:03.259
In July 2019, in an interview given to our film crew, Felix Mahamadiyev and Alexey Budinchuk assured us that they are not embarrassed by the criminal prosecution

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:10.259
and that they view any hardships they may have to face as an opportunity to prove their loyalty to Jehovah.

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:14.259
There were times when it seemed I couldn't take it anymore,

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:22.259
but every day I pray to Jehovah that he give me peace and joy for that day.

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:24.259
I'm so proud of him.

00:04:24.259 --> 00:04:34.259
Not only did he face the court trial with dignity, but he continues to bear up with dignity and he even helps me to endure.
