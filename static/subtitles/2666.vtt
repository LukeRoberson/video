00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:09.890
Our parents loved us, but they did it the wrong way.

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:14.890
They would often turn violent, so we learned that way of life.

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:22.390
I remember that since I was young, I was afraid of coming home one day and not finding my parents together,

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.390
because as far as I remember, they have always argued with each other.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.390
So we grew up with those values and those ways of thinking

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.390
that led us to become a group that was known and feared in the area,

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.390
because of our violent, immoral lifestyle devoted to drugs.

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.310
We had no rules.

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:47.310
We were people that you should stay away from.

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:55.219
It was one of those regular mornings when we were home alone,

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:59.219
and it used to become our hideout, the place we would meet.

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:03.219
We had skip school and our parents didn't know.

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:05.219
I was with the Rico Enra family.

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:10.219
When two sisters, two of Jehovah's Witnesses, rang the doorbell.

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:15.219
So we had them come in, so we could make fun of them.

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:18.219
And as a matter of fact, that's what we did.

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:25.219
I remember that Maria and the sister that was with her were two very sincere and genuine people.

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:29.219
They showed courage as they brought us the truth.

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:36.829
I was surprised that they were so kind, despite my tone of voice was mocking,

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:39.829
and they really appreciated their kindness.

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:44.829
She didn't let anything stop her, not even the way we looked.

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:48.829
I was really touched by the conversation with Maria.

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:52.829
But I thought I would never see her again.

00:01:52.829 --> 00:02:02.260
Who would ever come back to people like us?

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
Maria didn't give up.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.259
She came back with an older pioneer brother who wasn't scared of us

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.259
and with courage started to preach.

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:16.259
I really started to change my life and make progress.

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:21.259
Immediately, I started to speak about what I was learning with all my friends.

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:25.259
What surprised me was my mother's reaction.

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:27.259
She wasn't happy at all.

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:29.259
She reacted really violently.

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:39.580
They thought that I was going mad, that I was being brainwashed.

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:46.580
I remember they would do everything to remind me of the strong friendship that was between us.

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.580
So they would put pressure on me emotionally.

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.050
I had to make a choice.

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.050
Although I did love them and was close to them,

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:01.050
I made the drastic decision to tell them that from then on,

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:06.900
I would no longer be staying in their company.

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.900
This situation made me really intrigued.

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.900
In fact, I ended up studying with Francesco.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.900
His determination really made me think.

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.900
It was obvious that the things he was telling us were actually real.

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.900
It was the truth and also the strength he took to go forward with this.

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:35.900
His determination to leave his friends was surely what made all of us seriously interested in the message he was preaching.

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.900
I would blame it on the truth because it was taking my friend away from me.

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.900
A friend with whom I used to do the things I liked.

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.900
However, inside I knew, even though I told him he had gone mad,

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.900
I knew inside that there must have been something powerful

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.900
because he was so convinced and we could all sense his conviction.

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.900
So I realized that there was really something there.

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:08.900
To my surprise, one after the other, all of my friends started studying the Bible.

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.900
As I studied, I realized that it was the truth.

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.900
It used to be hatred that always motivated my choices.

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.899
Now, I act according to love and this makes me feel good.

00:04:21.899 --> 00:04:23.899
I can now say that,

00:04:23.899 --> 00:04:27.899
Pence du Marien Francesco, Jehovah tried to draw me to him.

00:04:27.899 --> 00:04:30.899
I believe it's been a miracle from Jehovah.

00:04:30.899 --> 00:04:36.899
The truth helped me cultivate the qualities of peace and joy,

00:04:36.899 --> 00:04:42.899
the personality that has made it possible for me to have the family I never had.

00:04:42.899 --> 00:04:47.899
The greatest satisfaction I have in life is to have a relationship with Jehovah.

00:04:47.899 --> 00:04:53.899
When I see someone like me used to be, I feel motivated to speak to them.

00:04:53.899 --> 00:04:58.899
The patients that Maria showed motivates me to be patient.

00:04:58.899 --> 00:05:02.899
Despite our reputation, Maria did not give up.

00:05:02.899 --> 00:05:12.459
She showed us that in Jehovah's eyes, no one is beyond recovery.

00:05:12.459 --> 00:05:14.459
No one.
