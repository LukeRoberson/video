00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.219
and introduction to the Book of Revelation.

00:00:05.219 --> 00:00:11.859
Revelation was written by the Apostle John, about 96 CE,

00:00:11.859 --> 00:00:15.859
while he was in exile on the island of Patmos.

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:22.859
The Book of Revelation is closely linked to the first book of the Bible, Genesis.

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.859
Genesis tells us how Paradise was lost.

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.859
Revelation tells us how Paradise will be regained.

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:39.859
Revelation can be viewed as being divided into 16 visions, covering 22 chapters.

00:00:39.859 --> 00:00:45.859
In chapters 1 to 3, John is told to write messages to seven congregations,

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:56.859
which are in Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea.

00:00:56.859 --> 00:01:02.859
In chapters 4 and 5, John sees a vision of Jehovah on his throne.

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:10.859
God hands a scroll sealed with seven seals to the Lamb, who is the glorified Christ.

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:16.859
In chapter 6, Jesus breaks open six of the seals.

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:22.859
As he breaks open the first four seals, four symbolic horsemen write forth.

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:28.859
The rides of the last three result in war, famine and death.

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:35.859
In chapter 7, John observes four angels holding back the winds of destruction

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:40.859
until all spiritual Israelites are sealed.

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:49.859
The Apostle also sees an innumerable multinational crowd that has come out of the Great Tribulation.

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:51.859
Did you know?

00:01:51.859 --> 00:02:00.859
At Genesis 315, God foretold that the offspring of a symbolic woman would crush the head of the serpent

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:05.859
that induced Adam and Eve to rebel against God.

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:15.860
Revelation exposes that original serpent as Satan the Devil, who used a snake to incite the rebellion in Eden.

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:22.860
The symbolic woman's offspring proved to be primarily the Messianic King Jesus Christ.

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.860
Others were foretold to rule with Him in heaven.

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:33.860
Revelation says that these co-rulers would number 144,000.

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.860
In chapters 8 and 9, the Lamb opens the seventh seal.

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.860
John sees seven angels with seven trumpets.

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:48.860
The trumpet blasts announce expressions of God's judgment on mankind.

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:57.860
In chapters 10 and 11, a strong angel gives John a little scroll, which he has commanded to eat.

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:07.860
John is then told to measure the temple sanctuary, after which he observes the experiences of God's two witnesses.

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.860
Then the seventh angel blows his trumpet and loud voices announce,

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:19.860
the kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ.

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:28.860
In chapter 12, John observes the birth of a son, who is quickly taken away to God into his throne,

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.860
and the hurling of Satan and his angels to the earth.

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:40.860
Then, in chapter 13, John sees fearsome beasts that dominate mankind.

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:48.860
Chapter 14 shows the Lamb standing on Mount Zion with the 144,000.

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:58.860
In chapters 15 and 16, seven angels pour out God's anger on the earth by means of seven golden bulls.

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:07.860
Here we learn that God's great war against the nations will be fought at a symbolic place called Armageddon.

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:18.860
Chapter 17 and 18 describe a drunken prostitute called Babylon the Great, who is riding a scarlet colored wild beast.

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:26.860
However, the beast, with its ten horns, turns on the prostitute and devastates her.

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:34.860
In chapter 19, John sees Jesus and his heavenly armies annihilate the wicked.

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:45.860
The final three visions contained in chapters 20 to 22 describe the abyssin of Satan, the thousand-year reign of Christ,

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:53.860
the earthly resurrection, and the everlasting destruction of both human and spirit rebels.

00:04:53.860 --> 00:05:04.860
John also sees the glorious New Jerusalem and a river of water of life flowing out from the throne of God and of the Lamb.

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.860
The banks of the river are lined with trees of life.

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:20.860
As you read the book of Revelation, note how the complete fulfillment of God's promise at Genesis 3.15 is described in prophetic visions.

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:26.860
See how God, by means of Christ, will remove all wickedness.

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:36.860
And see how Jehovah's will is going to be done forever on earth as it is in heaven thanks to God's kingdom.
