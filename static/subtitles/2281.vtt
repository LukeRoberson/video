00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:12.349
My name is Tmitri Karschenov, I live in the same city where I was born, in Gavrov.

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:23.829
It is a rural town in central Russia.

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:31.829
When I met Dima, I really enjoyed his company because he was a kind and approachable person,

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:34.829
and he was very sincere with me.

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.829
We met, dated for two years, and then were married.

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:41.829
The same year, our daughter was born.

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:52.320
I worked as an electrician.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:01:02.289
Since people were poor, frequently they offered to pay with alcohol.

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:13.569
When you live with an alcoholic, it's like you live on an active volcano.

00:01:16.459 --> 00:01:22.859
Sober, he was a good, kind, attentive husband.

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:31.099
But when he was drunk, he was a completely different person.

00:01:31.099 --> 00:01:33.099
He was angry.

00:01:33.099 --> 00:01:36.099
He wouldn't listen to anything.

00:01:36.099 --> 00:01:48.189
There was a knock at the door.

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:51.189
They asked me to look at the Bible.

00:01:51.189 --> 00:02:00.569
They showed me the reason why there is so much suffering

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:03.569
and why people are afraid to live today.

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:12.520
My wife read the whole thing.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.520
I saw that she liked it.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:22.439
The next time the woman came, I really liked what they told me,

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:27.439
especially about God's promise of the paradise on earth,

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:31.439
of people living in happiness on the earth.

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:35.439
So I agreed to a Bible study.

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:40.580
Many times they said,

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.580
what do you like to join us?

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:50.129
I'd say, no, I'm not ready for that yet.

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:55.050
I reached a real breaking point in my life.

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.050
I asked Luba, what should I do?

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.050
So then I suggested that he read the Bible.

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:07.050
He asked me, what should I start with?

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.050
I suggested beginning with the book of Matthew.

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.490
I read all night.

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:19.490
It was like I lived through the events I was reading about

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:22.490
and they touched my heart deeply.

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:27.490
It was then that I decided that until I read the whole Bible,

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:32.979
I wouldn't drink another drop.

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:37.979
Apparently, it touched his heart so much that he wanted to change.

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:41.979
Change his way of life, change his behavior,

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:46.900
and it was a big change.

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.900
Because meanwhile, it was quiet at home.

00:03:50.900 --> 00:04:07.330
I read the whole Bible and didn't drink for seven months.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.330
I got so fed up with my lifestyle.

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:13.330
I could not live like that anymore.

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:18.329
I saw from the Bible that there are only two paths

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:22.329
and that I am on the wrong one.

00:04:23.329 --> 00:04:28.329
I plead it with God and asked him to help me.

00:04:29.329 --> 00:04:36.329
He had times when he broke off the study and would drink again.

00:04:36.329 --> 00:04:41.329
So then it was difficult to pick up where he left off,

00:04:41.329 --> 00:04:48.120
to recover and again study the Bible.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.120
I realized that without God's help,

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:59.300
I couldn't crawl out of this hall, not on my own.

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.300
The Bible affected Dima very deeply.

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.300
Before, I felt that he didn't think about me at all,

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:13.670
that he only remembered that I exist when he needed something.

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:18.980
Now he is a completely different person.

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:26.259
So during our family worship is warm, affectionate and joyful.

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:29.259
We can talk with each other about spiritual things,

00:05:29.259 --> 00:05:35.259
hear each other's thoughts, understand what each other has inside,

00:05:35.259 --> 00:05:38.259
how each of us loves Jehovah.

00:05:43.769 --> 00:05:47.769
The joy that I feel every day can not be surpassed

00:05:47.769 --> 00:05:58.449
by the temporary enjoyment that comes from drinking alcohol or taking drugs.

00:05:58.449 --> 00:06:08.290
My life has changed drastically and it was Jehovah who influenced me that way.

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:13.290
His word made me into who I am now.

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:16.290
That is why I can say that.

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:19.290
I am happy.
