00:00:08.939 --> 00:00:18.460
There was something I always remembered watching my mother's hands as she carefully prepared

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:33.710
the bread for the memorial of Christ's death. She took it very seriously because of a special

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:45.810
meaning on the night before his death. Jesus told his disciples, this bread means my body.

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.969
After the bread and wine were passed around, Jesus said to them,

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:59.810
keep doing this and remembrance of me. To this day, that's what we do.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:19.920
Shari, can you bring me the flower, please? Thank you. It was a simple mixture, really.

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:40.560
Do you remember what comes next? Water? That is right. Can you ever add anything else?

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:48.239
No, it is very important that the bread is made in the same way as it was in Jesus' day.

00:01:48.239 --> 00:01:56.189
Just wheat, flour and water. That is all. But what if people do not have wheat flour?

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:04.030
Well, the bread can still be made with flour made from rice, barley, corn or a similar grain,

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.590
but nothing should be added besides the flour and the water. No yeast.

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:16.590
Not even salt. Not even salt. Remember what Jesus said in Luke 1610?

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:24.590
The person faithful in what is least is faithful also in, in much. That is right.

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.590
And we want to be faithful to Jehovah in all things. Right?

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:38.180
After mixing, she would need the dough and the dust would rise and fall as she worked.

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:40.979
Then she'd let me roll it up.

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:51.150
Then it would be placed on a lightly oiled pan for baking. When it was done,

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:55.469
it didn't look like the kind of bread you would night typically see.

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:02.909
It was rather plain looking, dry and cracker-like. It easily broke apart.

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:10.590
It was perfect. And we proudly brought it to the Kingdom Hall for the observance.

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:22.099
I happily remember those moments as I now prepare the bread for the memorial this year.

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:32.240
But even more importantly, when I think of what Jesus did for each of us,

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:43.310
it is a wonderful privilege to have a small contribution on this most important night of the year.
