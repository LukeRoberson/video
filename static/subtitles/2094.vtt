00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:13.300
It was a moment unnoticed by the majority of Armenia's three million citizens.

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:17.300
A young man, one of over 11,000 Jehovah's Witnesses in Armenia,

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:24.300
reunites with his family after being imprisoned for conscientiously objecting to military service.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.300
Over the past 20 years, Armenia has imprisoned more than 450 Jehovah's Witnesses

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.299
for conscientiously objecting to military service.

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:42.299
However, on November 12, 2013, Armenia released all remaining Jehovah's Witnesses from prison.

00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:50.299
This was the culmination of a legal battle that received international attention two years earlier in 2011.

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:54.299
When the grand chamber of the European Court of Human Rights

00:00:54.299 --> 00:01:00.299
addressed the issue of conscientious objection in the landmark case of Bia Tiang versus Armenia.

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:09.299
Good morning. I declare opens the public hearing on the merits in the case of Bia Tiang versus Armenia.

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:16.299
Mr. Bia Tiang, who's at the council table now, is a conscientious objector.

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:21.299
He is also one of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:33.299
And according to the chamber judgment, his objection was found to be an I quote based on his genuine religious convictions.

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.299
The grand chamber ruled in favor of Mr. Bia Tiang,

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:44.299
and recognized conscientious objection as a fundamental right protected under Article 9 of the European Convention,

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:48.299
related to freedom of thought, conscience and religion.

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.299
Arthur Ispirian, a legal representative of Jehovah's Witnesses in Armenia,

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:56.299
comments on the grand chamber's decision.

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:02.299
In fact, Bia Tiang versus Armenia was the historic judgment from European Court.

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:14.300
Before that, European Court didn't recognize that a person can refuse military service on the basis of his religious beliefs.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:23.300
Richard T. Griffiths, a professor at Leiden University in the Netherlands, who attended the Bia Tiang hearing, also comments on this issue.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:31.300
I've always thought that the fundamental question of conscientious objection is one of the human rights that should be respected,

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:36.300
that a citizen who believes that it is wrong to enter war should be allowed not to do so,

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:42.300
and yet still be able to fulfill their obligation to societies in other societally useful ways,

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.300
which are in conformity with their beliefs.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:51.300
When Armenia released all conscientious objectors from prison, as mandated by the European Court of Human Rights,

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.300
it was well received by Jehovah's Witnesses around the world.

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:03.300
It was also a significant victory for all who value freedom of conscience and religion.
