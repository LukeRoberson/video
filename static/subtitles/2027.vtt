00:00:02.189 --> 00:00:06.190
and introduction to First Chronicles.

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:08.189
In the original Hebrew canon,

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.189
first and second Chronicles

00:00:10.189 --> 00:00:12.189
were apparently one volume,

00:00:12.189 --> 00:00:16.190
which was later divided for convenience.

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:18.190
The writer of the entire volume

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:20.190
was evidently Ezra,

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:23.190
a priest and expert copyist of the law.

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:28.190
He completed the work about 460 BCE.

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:30.190
Aside from the genealogies,

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:32.189
which go back to Adam,

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.189
First Chronicles covers a period of 40 years,

00:00:36.189 --> 00:00:42.189
from about 1077 to 1037 BCE.

00:00:42.189 --> 00:00:45.189
The book can be divided into two sections.

00:00:45.189 --> 00:00:49.189
The first nine chapters deal largely with genealogies.

00:00:49.189 --> 00:00:53.399
The other 20 cover events

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.399
from the death of King Saul

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:57.399
to the end of David's reign.

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:06.459
Chapters 2 to 4 list the descendants of Judah and David,

00:01:06.459 --> 00:01:09.459
including the royal line.

00:01:09.459 --> 00:01:12.459
Chapter 6 lists the descendants of Levi,

00:01:12.459 --> 00:01:15.459
which includes the priestly line of Aaron.

00:01:15.459 --> 00:01:19.739
Did you know?

00:01:19.739 --> 00:01:21.739
The genealogies and history

00:01:21.739 --> 00:01:23.739
of First Chronicles were important

00:01:23.739 --> 00:01:26.739
for the outworking of God's purpose.

00:01:26.739 --> 00:01:28.739
The returning exiles needed them

00:01:28.739 --> 00:01:31.739
so that Israel would be a theocratic nation

00:01:31.739 --> 00:01:34.739
with a priesthood.

00:01:34.739 --> 00:01:37.739
The early Christian writers Matthew and Luke

00:01:37.739 --> 00:01:39.739
used the genealogies to show

00:01:39.739 --> 00:01:41.739
that Jesus was the son of David

00:01:41.739 --> 00:01:48.510
with a legal right to the throne.

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.510
In chapter 11,

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:54.510
David is made king over all Israel.

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:56.510
Soon thereafter,

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.510
David captures the stronghold of Zion.

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.510
In chapters 15 and 16,

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.510
the arc of the covenant

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:06.510
is taken to the city of David

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:09.509
on the shoulders of the Coethite Levites.

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.509
In chapter 17,

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:13.509
David expresses his desire

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:16.509
to build a temple for Jehovah.

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:18.509
However,

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:20.509
Jehovah tells David through Nathan

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:22.509
that one of the king's sons

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:24.509
will build the temple.

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:26.509
At the same time,

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:29.509
Jehovah reassures his beloved David

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:32.509
by promising to give him a lasting house

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:35.509
or royal dynasty.

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:37.509
Chapters 18 to 20

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:40.509
record David's victories over enemy nations,

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:42.509
including the Ammonites,

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:44.509
Edamites,

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:45.509
Moabites,

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:46.509
Felistines,

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:48.509
and Syrians.

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:50.509
In chapter 21,

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:56.139
David is incited to number Israel.

00:02:56.139 --> 00:02:59.139
David's sin greatly displeases Jehovah

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:04.139
and costs the lives of 70,000 Israelites.

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:07.139
In chapters 22 to 28,

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:09.139
David makes extensive preparations

00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:12.139
for the future temple.

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:14.139
In chapter 22,

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:16.139
he instructs his son Solomon

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:19.139
to build Jehovah's house.

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:21.139
David contributes toward the project

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:24.139
100,000 talents of gold,

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:27.139
one million talents of silver,

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:32.139
and an immeasurable amount of copper and iron.

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:34.139
In chapter 25,

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:37.139
David separates some of the sons of the Levites,

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:38.139
Asaph,

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:39.139
Human,

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:40.139
and Jaduthan

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:44.139
to serve as temple musicians and singers.

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:46.139
In chapter 28,

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:48.139
David assembles the princes of Israel

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:51.139
in Jerusalem and commands them.

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:53.139
Carefully observe and search

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:57.139
for all the commandments of Jehovah, your God.

00:03:57.139 --> 00:04:00.139
Then he gives Solomon the architectural plans

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:01.139
for the temple,

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:05.139
which David received by divine inspiration.

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:07.139
In chapter 29,

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:09.139
Solomon becomes king,

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:15.460
and David dies after reigning for 40 years.

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:17.459
As you read first Chronicles,

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:22.459
note how meticulously Ezra recorded Israel's history.

00:04:22.459 --> 00:04:27.459
Read how Jehovah blessed his beloved servant David,

00:04:27.459 --> 00:04:30.459
and see how the genealogies help to establish

00:04:30.459 --> 00:04:33.459
that Jesus of Nazareth was the Messiah,

00:04:33.459 --> 00:04:36.459
the future king of God's kingdom.
