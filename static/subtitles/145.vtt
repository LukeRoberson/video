00:00:01.419 --> 00:00:07.419
It's good to be alive and served Jehovah in these exciting times, don't you agree?

00:00:07.419 --> 00:00:12.419
There seems to be no end of new things happening in Jehovah's organization.

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:18.420
Wherever we look, we see more and more improvements and refinements being made.

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:25.420
For example, we have changes in the format of our meetings and conventions with video presentations.

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:33.420
The way we carry out our preaching work with the addition of metropolitan witnessing and the use of witnessing cards.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:42.420
Our new understanding of Bible teachings, especially with regard to the events that lie ahead of us in the Great Tribulation.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:49.420
Just a few years ago, Hoover's could have envisioned what has been happening in recent months.

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.420
Who would have thought that we would have our own broadcasting station via the internet,

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.420
or that we would make our literature available in some 800 languages?

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:08.420
Truly, the celestial chariot with Jehovah and the driver's seat is charging ahead at full speed.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.420
But how do you feel about all of this?

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.420
For me personally, I reflect on the joy I feel at the end of each convention,

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.420
whether it's a regional convention or an international one.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:29.420
Usually our hearts are filled to the brim and overflowing with joy and appreciation, aren't they?

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:38.420
Our feelings of joy echo the words of the Psalmist as recorded at Psalm 144, verse 15.

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.420
There it says, Happy is the people for whom it is this way.

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.420
Happy is the people whose God is Jehovah.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:58.859
But realistically, we have to admit that those feelings of joy and exhilaration do not always last.

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:05.859
It usually is a shock when we go home and have to face the realities of living in this week at Old World.

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:12.860
As second Timothy 31 clearly states, these are critical times hard to deal with.

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:19.860
So we should be surprised if at times we find it hard to maintain a positive attitude.

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:28.860
We may feel down, discouraged, disheartened and even overwhelmed by what we have to deal with.

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:34.860
What can help us to maintain a positive viewpoint under such circumstances?

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.860
Well, there are many things to start with.

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.860
Let's consider briefly three scriptures.

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:47.860
The first one is in Psalm 16, verse 11.

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.860
You make known to me the path of life.

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.860
In your presence is abundant joy.

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.860
There is happiness at your right hand forever.

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.860
What is the lesson for us?

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.860
Count your blessings.

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:10.860
Now the second scripture is Proverbs chapter 4 and verse 25.

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.860
There it tells us, your eyes should look straight ahead.

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.860
Yes, fix your gaze straight ahead of you.

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.860
What is the point of this verse?

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.860
Look to the future hope. See the bigger picture.

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:32.860
The third scripture is Ecclesiastes 4 and verse 6.

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:41.860
There we read, better is a handful of rest than two handfuls of hard work and chasing after the wind.

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.860
So what do we need to remember?

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.860
Get enough rest.

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:54.860
We need to be careful not to allow too much TV watching or surfing the internet to rob us of necessary rest and sleep.

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:59.860
Now these are just three of many things we need to keep in mind.

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:05.860
Another way to stay positive involves reading accounts recorded in the Bible.

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:15.860
When we look to the biblical record, we can't help but be encouraged by the fact that the prophets of old had similar feelings to ours.

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.860
They were people just like us.

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:23.860
For example, let's read what James was inspired to say about the prophet Elijah.

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:30.860
This is recorded for us at James 5, verse 17, where it says,

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:35.860
Elijah was a man with feelings like ours.

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:42.860
James goes on to show how prayer was of tremendous hope to Elijah, and he can likewise assist us.

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.860
But what else do we learn from Elijah's example?

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:55.860
Remember our dramatic Bible reading that helped us relive the exciting events of the time when Elijah challenged the false prophets of Bail,

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.860
and Jehovah proved that he is the only true God?

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:08.860
Can you imagine how faith strengthening it would have been to see fire actually come out of heaven and devour the sacrifice?

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:12.860
What about the expressions on the faces of those false prophets?

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.860
How would you have felt if you were Elijah?

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.860
Then what happened next?

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:24.860
The three-and-a-half-year-long drought broke with a heavy downpour.

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:30.860
Once again proving that Jehovah is the true God and that Elijah was his prophet.

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:39.860
Finally, Elijah outruns Ahab's chariot, running the 19 miles or 30 kilometers from Mount Carmel to Jezreel.

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:46.860
If you were Elijah, do you think that you would have been on an emotional high?

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:54.860
Your level of faith would have been at a peak, perhaps similar to how you feel at the end of an international convention.

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:59.110
Remember, though, what happened next?

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:04.110
The account at first Kings 19, 3, and 4 tells us,

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:11.110
At that he became afraid, so he got up and ran for his life.

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:17.110
He came to be a sheba which belongs to Judah and he left his attendant there.

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:23.110
He went a days journey into the wilderness and came and sat down under a broom tree,

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:26.110
and he asked that he might die.

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:27.110
He said,

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:29.110
It is enough.

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:37.110
Now of Jehovah take my life away, but I am no better than my forefathers.

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:41.110
But why was Elijah now so discouraged?

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:48.110
Notice what he said is recorded at first Kings 19 and verse 14.

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:53.110
I have been absolutely zealous for Jehovah the God of armies,

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:59.110
for the people of Israel have forsaken your covenant, your alters they have torn down,

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:02.110
and your prophets they have killed with the sword,

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:07.110
and I am the only one left.

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:11.110
Now they are seeking to take my life away.

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:14.110
Do you sometimes feel that way?

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:16.110
Woe is me.

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:19.110
I'm the only one facing this type of problem.

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:22.110
Nobody understands what I'm going through.

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:26.110
Well that thinking can undermine our positive attitude.

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:30.110
But what did Jehovah remind Elijah of?

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:35.110
Notice the three things listed at first Kings 19, 15 through 18.

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:41.110
The first point, Jehovah told him that the problem was going to be solved.

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:43.110
He was to anoint Jehu.

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:49.110
The second point, Jehovah promised him help in the form of a Lysha.

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:55.110
And the third point, Jehovah also informed him that he wasn't the only one.

00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:59.110
There were at least 7,000 others.

00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:04.110
We can be sure that Jehovah cares for us just as he cared for Elijah.

00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:10.110
Let's read about this in 1 Peter chapter 5 and verses 6 and 7.

00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:16.519
humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God,

00:08:16.519 --> 00:08:19.519
so that he may exalt you in due time.

00:08:19.519 --> 00:08:25.519
While you throw all your anxiety on him, because he cares for you.

00:08:25.519 --> 00:08:30.519
Yes, Jehovah cares for us and helps us when we are discouraged,

00:08:30.519 --> 00:08:33.519
just as he did for Elijah.

00:08:33.519 --> 00:08:40.519
When I look back over the years, I remember things that discouraged me and made me feel low.

00:08:40.519 --> 00:08:44.519
What were some of those difficult moments in my life?

00:08:45.519 --> 00:08:51.519
Well, I remember the time when, as a missionary, I nearly died of typhoid fever.

00:08:51.519 --> 00:08:55.519
I also remember supporting and caring for my first wife, Jenny,

00:08:55.519 --> 00:08:59.519
during her 10-year battle with breast cancer.

00:08:59.519 --> 00:09:07.519
Then also losing the sight in my left eye because of melanoma, a form of cancer.

00:09:07.519 --> 00:09:15.519
Losing close friends and deaths, including Jenny, sometimes one after the other in close succession.

00:09:15.519 --> 00:09:20.519
As a missionary, I had feelings of isolation.

00:09:20.519 --> 00:09:27.519
And then of course the frustration that comes because of my own mistakes and weaknesses.

00:09:27.519 --> 00:09:34.519
And trying to find a balance between what I want to do and what I can actually do.

00:09:34.519 --> 00:09:42.519
All those things have at times discouraged me, and I know that many of you have faced far worse challenges.

00:09:42.519 --> 00:09:48.519
But what can help us when we are overwhelmed by problems?

00:09:48.519 --> 00:09:52.519
Well, in addition to all the things that we've already discussed,

00:09:52.519 --> 00:09:59.519
we can find comfort in the words found at 1st Peter, chapter 5, verses 9 and 10.

00:09:59.519 --> 00:10:06.929
But take your stand against him, that is the devil, firm in the faith,

00:10:06.929 --> 00:10:16.929
knowing that the same kind of sufferings are being experienced by the entire association of your brothers in the world.

00:10:16.929 --> 00:10:22.929
But after you have suffered a little while, the God of all underserved kindness,

00:10:22.929 --> 00:10:28.929
who called you to his everlasting glory and union with Christ, will himself finish your training.

00:10:28.929 --> 00:10:34.929
He will make you firm, he will make you strong, he will firmly ground you.

00:10:34.929 --> 00:10:42.139
Yes, it's a wonderful encouragement to know that we're not alone.

00:10:42.139 --> 00:10:49.139
Many of our brothers and sisters have faced similar problems and have been able to cope successfully.

00:10:49.139 --> 00:10:58.139
As in Elijah's case, it is as if we're surrounded by a figurative 7,000 who are serving Jehovah along with us.

00:10:59.139 --> 00:11:05.139
But like Elijah, perhaps at times we might forget these faithful ones.

00:11:05.139 --> 00:11:08.139
So what do we need to do?

00:11:08.139 --> 00:11:12.139
Get to know them, ask them questions.

00:11:12.139 --> 00:11:16.139
We may be surprised by how encouraging their answers are.

00:11:16.139 --> 00:11:22.139
We may in fact discover a whole new resource to encourage and strengthen us.
