00:00:01.419 --> 00:00:10.419
For example, in South Korea, our brothers have been facing the neutrality issue since 1950.

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:17.420
Since that time, over 18,000 have been imprisoned for their faith.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:28.420
Right now, 607 of our brothers in South Korea are imprisoned for refusing to join the military.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.420
Consider the Nong Kong family.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.420
This Christian family has three sons.

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:41.420
The oldest has already finished his prison sentence and been reunited with his family.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:49.420
The second son is currently in prison, and the youngest son will soon be required to take his stand.

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:58.700
But in spite of these trials, this family is enduring without wavering.

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:05.620
Because their boys, they like to run around and play.

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:07.620
We play soccer together.

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.620
In the winter, we enjoy skiing or snowboarding.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:16.620
From when they were young, we did our best to teach them basic morals from the Bible.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:22.620
From morning to evening, my parents always reminded me that although they were hardships,

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:28.620
I could be proud of being imprisoned because Jehovah highly values my stand for integrity.

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:33.620
Knowing this gave me great comfort and encouragement.

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:39.620
I stood in court twice. I was so nervous. I didn't know what to say.

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:45.620
So I prayed and prayed. And sure enough, just as the scriptures promised,

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:51.620
I was able to recall all the words I needed to say and gave a bold witness before the judge.

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:58.450
After the sentencing, my heart ached so much.

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.450
My son had committed no crime, but he had to live in a bad environment.

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.449
Do her labor not be able to freely see those he loves.

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:16.449
These thoughts kept going through my mind. It was unbearable.

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:23.449
My brother wasn't where he would always be. I remember being really sad.

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:30.449
I kept thinking, my son did nothing wrong. Why does he have to go through this?

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:36.449
My heart hurt so much and there was no end to my tears.

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:43.449
I felt I needed to be strong for her. I never prayed so much for my wife as I did then.

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:50.449
I prayed for Jehovah's help and for him to help my children maintain their integrity,

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:57.449
despite whatever hardship they faced. And when I prayed for comfort to calm my heart,

00:02:57.449 --> 00:03:05.449
I felt a peace come over me. This convinced me that Jehovah was truly looking after my family.

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:11.449
Also, when the brothers mentioned those maintaining neutrality and their closing prayers,

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:14.449
it really gave me great strength.

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:23.069
As soon as I arrived in prison, I prayed to Jehovah to let me meet our brothers.

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:29.069
Soon after, I saw a brother about my age walk through the prison door.

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:38.069
I was amazed that Jehovah took notice of even such minor issues and how quickly he answered my prayers.

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:43.069
This helped me realize how much he really cares for me.

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:47.069
And knowing this, help me confront the challenges that lie ahead.

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:54.090
I still remember a comment that a brother made during one of our meetings in prison.

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.090
He talked about the means that Jehovah uses to provide help.

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:04.090
That he speaks to us through our well-prepared comments and encouraging talks.

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:10.939
Our middle son is in prison now. When I go to visit my son in prison,

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:14.939
he tells me that he is encouraging the other brothers, conducting meetings,

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:17.939
and feeling his spirituality is getting stronger.

00:04:17.939 --> 00:04:29.470
I was young and the daunting words of the non-witnesses terrified me.

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:36.470
Not being able to see and have physical contact with my loved ones for over a year was the hardest part to endure.

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:41.470
Despite difficult conditions, the brothers are doing their best to exalt Jehovah.

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:48.470
We know that he is pleased with us and watches over all the brothers who are maintaining their Christian neutrality.

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:58.329
My sons have loyally maintained their integrity to Jehovah and they continue to set a good example.

00:04:58.329 --> 00:05:03.329
That fact gives me great joy and happiness deep in my heart.

00:05:03.329 --> 00:05:10.990
Instead of viewing this as a trial, we see this as a way of demonstrating our faith to Jehovah.

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:16.990
I am convinced now that when we put spiritual things first in our lives,

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:22.300
Jehovah will help us maintain our faith.

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:28.300
Looking back on the experiences and trials that I face serving in prison for neutrality,

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:34.300
I feel more confident that I can overcome any difficulties that may lie ahead.

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:43.649
I often receive letters from brothers and sisters around the world.

00:05:43.649 --> 00:05:49.649
They often write, the entire congregation and I, along with our Christian family around the world,

00:05:49.649 --> 00:05:53.649
are praying for you brothers in Korea to keep your integrity.

00:05:53.649 --> 00:06:01.649
I am very grateful for their prayers and interest and thank our loving Father Jehovah for his constant care.
