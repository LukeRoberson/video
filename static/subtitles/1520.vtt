00:00:01.649 --> 00:00:13.150
The remains of this ancient fishing boat were discovered in the mid-1980s when a drought caused the water level in the sea of Galilee to fall, exposing part of the hull in the mud.

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:26.019
The wooden remains are over 8 meters or 27 feet long and 2.3 meters or 7.5 feet wide.

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:30.519
They were excavated and are on display in a museum in Israel.

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:37.619
This reconstruction is based on those remains.

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:46.619
Archaeologists say that the boat was built sometime between the first century BCE and the first century CE.

00:00:46.619 --> 00:00:53.619
This is what the boat may have looked like as it traversed the waters some 2,000 years ago.
