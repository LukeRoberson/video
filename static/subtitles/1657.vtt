00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:04.879
Life was simple, I remember.

00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:09.099
I am Jason, and I am deaf.

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:12.679
Growing up with this disability was hard.

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:18.550
When I was younger, I saw people laughing and family showing affection.

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:24.489
I just walked around the neighborhood and observed what was going on around me.

00:00:24.489 --> 00:00:29.649
I saw them walking and talking and wondered what that was all about.

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:33.450
Everything was a mystery to me.

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.329
But one day was a little different.

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:43.600
I saw children my age having fun, and they wanted me to play with them.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:52.500
I said to myself, me, I can't believe they actually wanted me to be with them.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:01:01.700
For once I felt welcomed, and that was how we became the best of friends.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:07.939
Time went by so fast, we grew up spending time and discovering new things together.

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:13.060
I was having so much fun with their company that even questionable acts seemed right to me.

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.219
I learned how to smoke.

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:21.209
They taught me how to drink alcohol to our hearts content.

00:01:21.209 --> 00:01:24.769
It felt like it was the best time of our lives.

00:01:24.769 --> 00:01:44.799
I thought everything we did was how things were actually supposed to be.

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:52.129
One day, in a deaf search in our area, the witnesses found me.

00:01:52.129 --> 00:01:59.290
I was hesitant at first, but they were very kind and friendly.

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.769
They educated me.

00:02:01.769 --> 00:02:08.569
They even taught me how to sign my name.

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:13.819
Eventually, I studied the Bible with them.

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:17.340
I learned different truths from the Bible.

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.340
Finally came to know Jehovah, the only true God.

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.860
I learned the things Jehovah liked and disapproved of.

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.580
Our Bible study moved me to reexamine the life I lived.

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:37.419
I realized that what I did before wasn't pleasing to Jehovah.

00:02:37.419 --> 00:02:44.520
My love for Jehovah grew deeper, and I knew exactly what I wanted to do.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:53.789
I started to attend Christian meetings, and I met new friends in the congregation.

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:57.030
The Bible changed my life.

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:02.189
I gave my all to Jehovah and decided to dedicate myself to him.

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:12.229
It brought me nothing but real happiness.

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:20.099
And now, I am in full time service, eagerly declaring the good news.

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:28.139
I was appointed to serve as a ministerial servant in our congregation, and I was called

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:39.400
to volunteer in Bethel too.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.080
I wouldn't have felt genuine happiness in accomplishing these spiritual assignments if

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:51.919
I wasn't in Jehovah's organization.

00:03:51.919 --> 00:03:56.759
To all the deaf out there, that haven't had the chance to know Jehovah yet.

00:03:56.759 --> 00:04:02.000
I hope and encourage you to study the Bible with the witnesses too.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Look at me, before I wasn't able to read and write.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.280
I realized that even if we can't hear, we can still have a relationship with the only

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.919
true God.

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:20.279
I hope you find the same love and joy as I did under Jehovah's loving hands.

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:26.920
Jehovah has helped me, and for that, I will always thank and love him with all my heart.
