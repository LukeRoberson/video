00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.300
They are no part of the world.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.300
John 17, 16.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.300
We must remain neutral in order to be low subjects of God's Kingdom.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.300
Otherwise, how could we have a clean conscience when we preach the good news?

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.299
The only God's Kingdom can solve mankind's problems?

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:36.299
A Satan's system, near its end,

00:00:36.299 --> 00:00:39.299
we can expect the issue of neutrality to become more prominent.

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.310
You feel world-government should implement.

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.310
Remember, it's young people like you, each of you,

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.310
who must say catch and to solve the problems that threaten our planet.

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:36.120
When war comes, they'll look for you and me to do the fighting.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.120
Will you speak up until them? No, we won't.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:59.069
A special for your generation.

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:01.069
I mean, who do you think it's going to win?

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:04.069
Well, we believe that...

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:09.069
That's actually a very interesting question.

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:12.069
And as Jehovah's Witnesses, we believe that it's God's Kingdom

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:16.069
that's going to bring about all the solutions that we need for all of our problems, for example.

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.069
That's 750 please.

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:25.199
Thank you.

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:28.199
But you know, there's no government's policy.

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:30.199
I really think it's going to work.

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:31.199
It's crazy.

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:34.199
With their policies, we'll be bankrupt within three years.

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:37.199
But if it works, it's going to make people rich.

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:39.199
Those are a ritual ready.

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:41.199
No, I'm fed up. They say the same thing.

00:02:41.199 --> 00:03:01.490
We've invited a panel of experts to explore these issues.

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:04.490
Namely, can the opposition party win?

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:07.490
Will they keep their promises to lower income people?

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:11.490
And what changes could we expect on required military service?

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.490
You'll want to hear the answers.

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:17.490
Let's begin by speaking to John McCarthy, Minister of Education.

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:21.490
If put to the test, I do want to take my stand for Jehovah.

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:25.490
But the outcome of all these things can affect me now.

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:29.490
My family, my goals.

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:31.490
How can I stay neutral?

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:33.490
Even in my heart.

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:37.599
John 17.

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:43.939
Verse 14.

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:45.939
I have given your word to them.

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:47.939
But the world has hated them.

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:49.939
Because they are no part of the world.

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:52.939
Just as I am no part of the world.

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:55.939
I do not request that you take them out of the world.

00:03:55.939 --> 00:03:59.939
But that you watch over them because of the wicked one.

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:01.939
They are no part of the world.

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:04.939
Just as I am no part of the world.

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:06.939
Sanctify them by means of the truth.

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:08.939
Your word is truth.

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:10.939
Just as you sent me into the world.

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:13.939
I also sent them into the world.

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:16.939
And I am sanctifying myself in their behalf.

00:04:16.939 --> 00:04:21.939
So that they also may be sanctified by means of truth.

00:04:21.939 --> 00:04:23.939
No part of the world.

00:04:23.939 --> 00:04:25.939
Like Jesus.

00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:28.939
Both in thought and action.

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:34.910
Sure, but in our lifetime.

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:37.910
Yes, and I have found something that has helped me to be sure of this.

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:39.910
Can I share it with you?

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:42.910
It's here in Matthew 24, 33.

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:44.910
Jesus said, likewise, also you.

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:48.910
When you see all these things, know that he is near.
