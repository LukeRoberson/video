WEBVTT

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:06.839
We have faith in Jehovah, and we trust His promises.

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:12.839
And in this, we have a wonderful example in Sarah Abraham's wife.

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:16.839
If you take all the words that are attributed to Sarah in Genesis,

00:00:16.839 --> 00:00:19.839
they amount to about a dozen sentences.

00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:23.839
Half of them were about Hagar and Ishmael.

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:28.839
The other half about Sarah's own ability to produce a son for Abraham.

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:34.840
Clearly, this promise of producing offspring for Abraham was very important.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.840
But how did Sarah feel about it?

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.840
You learn something from her own words,

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.840
but we get a very strong clue in this verse in Hebrews chapter 11.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.840
So please turn to Hebrews chapter 11 and stay there in your Bible.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.840
Here's our key verse, 11.

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.840
By faith also Sarah received power to conceive offspring,

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:06.840
even when she was past the age since she considered Him faithful who made the promise.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.840
She considered Him faithful who made the promise.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.840
Now that kind of faith doesn't develop overnight.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.840
So let's look at about 25 years of Sarah's life

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.840
and see how she retained faith in Jehovah's promises despite hardship,

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.840
disappointment, and uncertainty.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.150
Hardship. Sarah is about 65 years old,

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:43.150
and she accompanies her husband Abraham across the Euphrates River south towards the land of Canaan.

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.150
It was a long, arduous journey.

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.150
But they were powered by Jehovah's promise.

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.150
I'm going to make a great nation out of you.

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.150
That didn't mean it was easy.

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.150
They were still getting used to this new country finding their way around

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.150
when the land was gripped by famine,

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:07.150
and to make another long journey all the way down to Egypt.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.150
It gets worse.

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:12.150
Sarah's kidnapped as a potential wife of Pharaoh.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.150
Has the God of promise abandoned them?

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.150
By no means.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.150
Jehovah miraculously saves Sarah from the situation,

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.150
then gets back safely to the land of Canaan,

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.150
and as a family they start to prosper.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.150
What does Sarah learn from this about Jehovah's promises?

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.150
Don't focus on the hardship,

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:42.330
but on how Jehovah carries you through it.

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:43.330
Disappointment.

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.740
You imagine the excitement of Abraham,

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.740
when one night he comes and shares with Sarah

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.740
what Jehovah has just told him.

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.740
Look up at the stars of heaven.

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:57.740
Can you count them?

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.740
So your offspring will become.

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:02.740
And Jehovah also said to Abraham,

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:07.740
your offspring will be afflicted and enslaved for 400 years

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:11.740
before they come back and take possession of the land.

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:16.740
Now, if you're a Sarah, how do you respond?

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:19.740
400 years.

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:22.740
We've been here for 10 years,

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.740
and still 400 years,

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.740
we won't even see this in our lifetime.

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.740
So how does Sarah really respond

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:34.740
when she learned the full extent of this,

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.740
of Jehovah's larger promise?

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:41.340
Go back to Hebrews chapter 11,

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.340
and verses 11 and 12 talked about Sarah's faith,

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.340
and then verse 13 says,

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.340
in faith all of these, including Sarah, died,

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.340
although they did not receive the fulfillment of the promises,

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.340
not in their lifetime.

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:03.340
But they saw them from a distance and welcomed them.

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.340
Because of Sarah's faith in Jehovah's promise,

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:11.900
she was willing to be patient to follow Jehovah's timetable.

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.900
But this probably wasn't her biggest disappointment.

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.899
I just said again,

00:04:18.899 --> 00:04:20.899
I'm going to make Abraham's offspring

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:22.899
like the stars of heaven.

00:04:22.899 --> 00:04:26.899
And Sarah really wanted that privilege

00:04:26.899 --> 00:04:29.899
of producing a son for Abraham to be hers.

00:04:29.899 --> 00:04:31.899
But now at the age of 75,

00:04:31.899 --> 00:04:34.899
it seemed that her chances of having their privilege

00:04:34.899 --> 00:04:37.899
were just slipping away.

00:04:37.899 --> 00:04:39.899
What would she do?

00:04:39.899 --> 00:04:41.899
Well, she realized here too,

00:04:41.899 --> 00:04:44.899
the promise was bigger than her.

00:04:44.899 --> 00:04:47.899
And so she took Hagar, her maid servant,

00:04:47.899 --> 00:04:49.899
and gave her to Abraham

00:04:49.899 --> 00:04:55.889
so that she could give a son to him.

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:57.889
She had faith in Jehovah's promise,

00:04:57.889 --> 00:04:59.889
and despite her personal disappointment,

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:06.550
she wanted to do everything she could to support it.

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:11.550
Close on the heels of disappointment or uncertainty.

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:17.550
Do you think as Sarah watched young Ishmael,

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.550
Hagar's son, grow up,

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:22.550
that she wondered about her own role,

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:24.550
her own real value.

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:28.550
The next time we meet up with Sarah,

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:30.550
Ishmael is about 13 years of age,

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:33.550
and Sarah is 89.

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:37.550
She and Abraham are entertaining three angelic messages

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:39.550
from Jehovah.

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:42.550
And as she listens to the conversation,

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.550
she realizes that this time the message

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:46.550
is not just for Abraham,

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:48.550
it's for her.

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:50.550
This time next year,

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:52.550
Sarah will have a son.

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:53.550
As she listens,

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:54.550
she can't help herself.

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:55.550
She laughs,

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:57.550
and then she denies laughing.

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:01.550
So her laughter was this lack of faith,

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:04.550
disbelief in Jehovah's promise?

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:06.550
No, go back to our key verse,

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:09.550
because this is exactly where it comes in, verse 11.

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:12.550
By faith, Sarah received power

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:14.550
to conceive offspring

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:18.550
since she considered him faithful

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:21.550
who made the promise.

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:24.550
She always had that faith.

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:27.550
Now, imagine Sarah's joy.

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:29.550
She is raising a young son

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:33.550
with the beautiful spiritual disposition.

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:35.550
This is exactly the one,

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:37.550
the right disposition

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:40.550
to carry on Jehovah's great promise.

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:42.550
This is her son.

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:46.829
Sarah didn't live long enough

00:06:46.829 --> 00:06:49.829
to see Isaac, Mary, Rebecca,

00:06:49.829 --> 00:06:52.829
or to have his twin boys.

00:06:52.829 --> 00:06:54.829
But when she wakes up in the paradise,

00:06:54.829 --> 00:06:56.829
she'll be able to find out all of that,

00:06:56.829 --> 00:06:59.829
and she will learn the remarkable role

00:06:59.829 --> 00:07:04.829
that Jehovah always had in mind for her in his purpose.

00:07:04.829 --> 00:07:06.829
But going back,

00:07:06.829 --> 00:07:11.829
how did Sarah cope with those years of uncertainty?

00:07:11.829 --> 00:07:13.829
Let's go back to Hebrews 11,

00:07:13.829 --> 00:07:15.829
because we've described Sarah

00:07:15.829 --> 00:07:18.829
as a woman of faith in Jehovah's promises.

00:07:18.829 --> 00:07:22.829
Now, a few verses earlier, in verse 6,

00:07:22.829 --> 00:07:25.829
this is an important aspect of faith.

00:07:25.829 --> 00:07:26.829
Paul says,

00:07:26.829 --> 00:07:28.829
moreover, without faith,

00:07:28.829 --> 00:07:31.829
it is impossible to please God well.

00:07:31.829 --> 00:07:34.829
For whoever approaches God must believe,

00:07:34.829 --> 00:07:37.829
must believe that he is,

00:07:37.829 --> 00:07:39.829
and that he becomes the rewarder

00:07:39.829 --> 00:07:43.829
of those earnestly seeking him.

00:07:43.829 --> 00:07:45.829
Now, Sarah didn't always know

00:07:45.829 --> 00:07:49.829
how Jehovah would reward her or when,

00:07:49.829 --> 00:07:52.829
but she did have this kind of faith,

00:07:52.829 --> 00:07:55.829
and so she believed in Jehovah

00:07:55.829 --> 00:08:00.829
as the rewarder and the fulfiller of promises.

00:08:00.829 --> 00:08:01.829
So what have we learned from Sarah

00:08:01.829 --> 00:08:06.300
when it comes to Jehovah's promises?

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:07.300
We live hardship,

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:09.300
but that's not where we focus.

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:12.300
We focus on how Jehovah's helping us.

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:15.300
If we experience personal disappointment,

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:18.300
we realize Jehovah's promises bigger than us.

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:21.300
We patiently wait on Jehovah,

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:26.300
and we humbly do what we can to support his great work.

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:27.300
We'll face uncertainty,

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:28.300
but in all things,

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:33.299
we trust our rewarder and his promises.

00:08:33.299 --> 00:08:34.299
Every day,

00:08:34.299 --> 00:08:36.299
we rely on the fact

00:08:36.299 --> 00:08:38.299
that Jehovah has made promises,

00:08:38.299 --> 00:08:40.299
and he fulfills them on our behalf.

00:08:40.299 --> 00:08:44.299
Jehovah never lets us down.

00:08:44.299 --> 00:08:46.299
And the best is yet to come.

00:08:46.299 --> 00:08:47.299
We know this,

00:08:47.299 --> 00:08:49.299
because like Sarah,

00:08:49.299 --> 00:08:51.299
we consider him faithful,

00:08:51.299 --> 00:08:53.299
who made the promise.
