00:00:01.139 --> 00:00:07.139
Greetings, and welcome to JW Broadcasting.

00:00:07.139 --> 00:00:11.140
Here are a few highlights from this month's program.

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:16.140
Sam Wellay was torn between his career and the truth.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.140
How did he resolve this conflict?

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.140
And what steps did he take to reach his spiritual goals?

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.140
Perhaps you've been impatient with someone,

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.140
because they're not handling a situation the way you would.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:36.140
In a new dramatization, Nita and Jade learn how to cultivate patience.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.140
In this episode of Our History in Motion,

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:46.140
we'll see how conventions strengthen unity and love among Jehovah's people.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.140
This is JW Broadcasting for November 2022.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:01:11.920
In our broadcast for this month,

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.920
we're going to discuss the quality of patience.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.920
Think of how many situations we encounter they require patience,

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.920
waiting to rush our traffic, dealing with a difficult co-worker,

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.920
raising a child, overcoming marital problems,

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.920
coping with the illness of a loved one,

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.920
or maybe coping with an illness of our own.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:45.920
Clearly, all of us face situations that require us to display a measure of patience each day.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:54.920
If we don't have patience, we can become frustrated, tired, and discouraged.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.920
But no matter what our circumstances are,

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.920
all of us can develop this quality.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.920
How do we know?

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.920
Because according to Galatians 522,

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.919
patience is an aspect of the fruitage of God's spirit.

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:11.919
And with its help,

00:02:11.919 --> 00:02:16.919
we can make this quality an integral part of our personality.

00:02:16.919 --> 00:02:18.919
For this to happen,

00:02:18.919 --> 00:02:22.919
let's now answer two important questions.

00:02:22.919 --> 00:02:28.919
First, how can being patient help us to express our love for Jehovah?

00:02:28.919 --> 00:02:34.919
And second, how can being patient improve our relationship with others?

00:02:34.919 --> 00:02:37.919
Let's start with our first question.

00:02:37.919 --> 00:02:42.919
How can being patient help us to express our love for Jehovah?

00:02:42.919 --> 00:02:47.919
Let's consider what stated in 1 Corinthians chapter 13.

00:02:47.919 --> 00:02:51.919
This chapter gives us a description of how love manifests itself.

00:02:51.919 --> 00:02:55.919
Please follow along as I read verse 4.

00:02:55.919 --> 00:03:00.919
Love is patient and kind. Love is not jealous.

00:03:00.919 --> 00:03:04.919
It does not brag, does not give puffed up.

00:03:04.919 --> 00:03:07.919
Of all the many qualities that stem from love,

00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:11.919
did you note which one is listed first?

00:03:11.919 --> 00:03:13.919
Patients.

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:17.919
It is an integral aspect of love.

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:23.919
We need both love and patience in order to be successful and ensure we're on the right course,

00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:26.919
which includes pleasing Jehovah.

00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:31.919
If we think of situations where a lack of patience was a factor,

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:37.919
we can usually identify where a lack of love was evident.

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:42.919
Take for example, God shows in people the nation of Israel.

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:48.919
In Psalm 106, written many years after Israel's deliverance from Egypt,

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:54.919
the Psalmist indicates that they continued acting with a similar disposition.

00:03:54.919 --> 00:04:01.919
Despite that, Jehovah extended patience to them for many years.

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:07.919
Please follow along as I read Psalm 106, verses 7 and 8.

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:12.919
Our forefathers in Egypt did not appreciate your wonderful works.

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:16.920
They did not remember your abundant loyal love,

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.920
but they rebelled at the sea, by the red sea.

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:26.920
But he saved them for the sake of his name to make his mightiness known.

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:28.920
And what was the result?

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.920
Let's read verse 13.

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:34.920
But they quickly forgot what he did.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.920
They did not wait for his counsel.

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:42.199
How sad.

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:46.199
The people did not wait.

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:49.199
They were not patient.

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:55.199
And that highlights that they did not appreciate Jehovah's patience and loyal love.

00:04:55.199 --> 00:05:00.199
Love for God should have caused them to think about the consequences of their actions.

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:04.199
They should have remembered how Jehovah cared and provided for them.

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:09.199
That should have moved them to be patient and wait on Jehovah's direction.

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:16.199
But time and again, their actions show that they really didn't love Jehovah as they should have.

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:18.199
And it costs them.

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:21.199
They eventually tested Jehovah's patience to the limit.

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:25.199
And as a nation, lost his favor.

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:29.199
What can you and I learn from their example?

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:33.199
Never would we want to become independent of Jehovah,

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:40.199
trusting in our own thinking, and not patiently waiting for Jehovah's counsel to direct the decisions we make.

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:45.199
Think about how well we've been guided recently, regarding the pandemic.

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:50.199
Natural disasters in the organizing of our ministry.

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:57.199
Even if we didn't fully understand or even fully agree with all the decisions.

00:05:57.199 --> 00:06:06.199
Our love for God helped us to take the time to think about Jehovah's care for us and trust him.

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:12.199
By doing so, we learned that if we're patient and submit to Jehovah's direction,

00:06:12.199 --> 00:06:18.199
we won't go off course and will benefit ourselves and others.

00:06:18.199 --> 00:06:25.930
And in doing so, we ultimately express our love for Jehovah.

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:28.930
Let's now answer the second question.

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:32.930
How can being patient improve our relationship with others?

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:38.930
If we go back to 1 Corinthians 13-4, the study note states,

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:45.930
patience is a quality that Jehovah and Jesus constantly show in their dealings with humans.

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:53.930
As imitators of Jesus and Jehovah, Christians are to show patience to others.

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:57.930
So if Jehovah and Jesus are patient with us,

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:03.930
it would follow that we imitate their example and be patient with others.

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:08.930
Let's start with the greatest example, Jehovah.

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:14.930
Think about the patience he's shown in waiting to bring it in to this system.

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:18.930
Jehovah has a fixed day and hour when that will take place,

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:21.930
and he's patiently waiting until that arrives.

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:25.930
He's bound himself to his own timetable.

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:32.930
Now rest assured, Jehovah is well aware of how we feel as his servants.

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:37.930
He knows that we wish the end of this system to come as soon as possible

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:41.930
and that we long to see the fulfillment of all his promises,

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:45.930
and he longs to fulfill them.

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:51.930
But he will not become impatient and act before his appointed time.

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:57.269
Why should we appreciate Jehovah's patience in that regard?

00:07:57.269 --> 00:08:02.269
Please follow along as I read 2 Peter 3-15.

00:08:02.269 --> 00:08:10.540
Furthermore, consider the patience of our Lord as salvation,

00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:16.540
just as our beloved brother Paul also wrote you according to the wisdom given him.

00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:19.540
Isn't that a powerful point?

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:25.540
Jehovah's patience is the means for our salvation.

00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:29.540
Think about the number of people who are learning the truth every year.

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:36.539
Even during the pandemic, when we weren't able to engage in our typical house to house witnessing,

00:08:36.539 --> 00:08:41.539
tens of thousands of individuals still got baptized worldwide.

00:08:41.539 --> 00:08:48.539
Perhaps some of those included your Bible students, family members, close friends,

00:08:48.539 --> 00:08:51.539
or maybe even you yourself.

00:08:51.539 --> 00:08:53.539
And think about this.

00:08:53.539 --> 00:08:58.539
If Jehovah had impatiently brought the end of this system,

00:08:58.539 --> 00:09:02.539
five, ten, or twenty years ago,

00:09:02.539 --> 00:09:05.539
would you have learned the truth?

00:09:05.539 --> 00:09:12.539
So we appreciate that Jehovah is still patiently waiting for his day to arrive

00:09:12.539 --> 00:09:17.539
and has allowed so many to attain to repentance and develop a relationship with him.

00:09:17.539 --> 00:09:23.139
How should this affect our relationship with others?

00:09:23.139 --> 00:09:27.139
Perhaps it can help us to be more patient with a progressive Bible student

00:09:27.139 --> 00:09:30.139
who's still maybe struggling with a problem.

00:09:30.139 --> 00:09:35.139
Or maybe it's still difficult for some of our relatives to see us as one of Jehovah's Witnesses

00:09:35.139 --> 00:09:40.139
and to adjust to our beliefs and lifestyle.

00:09:40.139 --> 00:09:46.139
But in imitation of Jehovah's patience, we won't give up on them.

00:09:46.139 --> 00:09:54.139
And of course, reflecting on Jehovah's patience should move us to continue to have a full share in the ministry,

00:09:54.139 --> 00:09:58.139
earnestly looking for those who are rightly disposed for everlasting life

00:09:58.139 --> 00:10:02.139
and helping them to love Jehovah and serve him.

00:10:02.139 --> 00:10:09.809
Then they too can benefit from Jehovah's patience just as we have.

00:10:09.809 --> 00:10:13.809
We can also learn from the example of Jesus.

00:10:13.809 --> 00:10:17.809
He demonstrated tremendous patience when his disciples were arguing among themselves

00:10:17.809 --> 00:10:19.809
as to who was the greatest.

00:10:19.809 --> 00:10:23.809
This apparently happened on a number of occasions.

00:10:23.809 --> 00:10:27.809
And no doubt it's said in Jesus to hear this.

00:10:27.809 --> 00:10:30.809
But Jesus was patient with them.

00:10:30.809 --> 00:10:33.809
He showed empathy for them.

00:10:33.809 --> 00:10:41.809
He knew how much the culture and the environment in which they had been raised affected their thinking and attitude.

00:10:41.809 --> 00:10:45.809
That knowledge caused him to react kindly.

00:10:45.809 --> 00:10:47.809
Note one beautiful example.

00:10:47.809 --> 00:10:51.809
Please read with me March 9.

00:10:51.809 --> 00:10:55.809
March 9.33.35

00:10:55.809 --> 00:10:58.809
And they came into cavernium.

00:10:58.809 --> 00:11:03.809
Now, when he was inside the house, he put the question to them,

00:11:03.809 --> 00:11:06.809
what were you arguing about on the road?

00:11:06.809 --> 00:11:08.809
Well, we know the answer.

00:11:08.809 --> 00:11:13.809
They had been arguing about who among them was the greater.

00:11:13.809 --> 00:11:15.809
Look at verse 35.

00:11:15.809 --> 00:11:19.809
So he sat down and called the 12 and said to them,

00:11:19.809 --> 00:11:26.809
if anyone wants to be first, he must be lastable and ministerable.

00:11:26.809 --> 00:11:29.809
Did you know what Jesus did?

00:11:29.809 --> 00:11:36.809
He patiently waited for the right time to correct them kindly.

00:11:36.809 --> 00:11:38.809
He didn't make a scene on the road.

00:11:38.809 --> 00:11:43.809
Verse 33, he waited until he was inside the house.

00:11:43.809 --> 00:11:48.809
Verse 35, sitting down.

00:11:48.809 --> 00:11:51.809
He calmed the situation.

00:11:51.809 --> 00:11:53.809
He didn't push them.

00:11:53.809 --> 00:12:00.809
Instead, he led them patiently by instruction and by example.

00:12:00.809 --> 00:12:04.809
What a great example in avoiding becoming provoked.

00:12:04.809 --> 00:12:11.809
And instead of acting immediately, waiting for the right time to address matters,

00:12:11.809 --> 00:12:17.659
even when our patience is tested.

00:12:17.659 --> 00:12:21.659
What else can we take away from Jesus' example of patience?

00:12:21.659 --> 00:12:26.659
If you're a parent, can you imitate the way that Jesus dealt with his apostles?

00:12:26.659 --> 00:12:31.659
It may be frustrating if your children don't respond immediately to your counsel,

00:12:31.659 --> 00:12:36.659
or if they're slow in correcting their shortcomings, or perhaps you're an elder.

00:12:36.659 --> 00:12:42.659
And someone you're trying to help may be slow when responding to Bible-based counsel.

00:12:42.659 --> 00:12:45.659
But remember Jesus' example.

00:12:45.659 --> 00:12:48.659
He never gave up on his apostles.

00:12:48.659 --> 00:12:53.659
He kept looking for the good, expressing confidence in them,

00:12:53.659 --> 00:13:00.659
and patiently repeated lessons that they needed so that they could draw closer to Jehovah.

00:13:00.659 --> 00:13:08.659
If we do the same, not giving up, our patience may eventually be rewarded as well.

00:13:08.659 --> 00:13:14.659
So to review, how can being patient help us to express our love for Jehovah?

00:13:14.659 --> 00:13:20.659
It stops us from running ahead of Jehovah, demonstrating our loyal love for him.

00:13:20.659 --> 00:13:27.659
Waiting patiently for Jehovah's direction and guidance ensures that our course is pleasing to him.

00:13:27.659 --> 00:13:32.659
And second, how can being patient improve our relationship with others?

00:13:32.659 --> 00:13:43.649
It helps us to avoid acting rashly, and to look for the good in others, and express confidence in them.

00:13:43.649 --> 00:13:49.649
Hopefully, this discussion will help us appreciate the benefit of displaying patience in our lives.

00:13:49.649 --> 00:13:56.649
With the increasing pressures of these last days, we'll need to display patience more than ever before.

00:13:56.649 --> 00:14:02.649
Imitating the patience of Jehovah and Jesus will help us keep the right attitude.

00:14:02.649 --> 00:14:07.649
We won't become overly discouraged or overwhelmed by the present wickedness in this system,

00:14:07.649 --> 00:14:11.649
or even be impatient about when it will end.

00:14:12.649 --> 00:14:20.649
Instead, we'll stay on the right course, keeping busy, working to develop a closer relationship with Jehovah,

00:14:20.649 --> 00:14:27.649
and keeping active in our ministry, helping others to learn about Jehovah and benefit from his patience.

00:14:27.649 --> 00:14:34.649
May all of us keep working to make the quality of patience a dominant part of our personality.

00:14:34.649 --> 00:14:40.649
As we do, we will demonstrate how much we value and appreciate this wonderful quality

00:14:40.649 --> 00:14:44.649
and bring all praise and honor to Jehovah.

00:14:44.649 --> 00:14:53.659
To give Jehovah their best, some of our brothers give up lucrative and prestigious careers.

00:14:53.659 --> 00:14:59.659
Making this decision may take time and patience, as we'll see in our first video.

00:15:06.850 --> 00:15:11.850
I played in the series A, which is the top league in Italy.

00:15:11.850 --> 00:15:18.850
I was on the national youth team, and I went all the way up to the men's national team.

00:15:18.850 --> 00:15:29.720
Just the fact that you are good at your job is gratifying, and then there is also the financial aspect.

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:35.720
My mom and dad were Jehovah's witnesses, and so was my older brother.

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:41.720
At a certain point, I felt conflicted,

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:48.639
especially when I decided to draw closer to the truth.

00:15:48.639 --> 00:15:51.639
There was no longer a family thing.

00:15:51.639 --> 00:15:57.639
In time, something started to develop in me, a fire, a small fire.

00:15:57.639 --> 00:16:04.639
Gradually, I came to the point of dedication to Jehovah, although I still played.

00:16:04.639 --> 00:16:12.639
But maybe, not maybe, definitely, I wasn't giving Jehovah my best, my energy.

00:16:13.639 --> 00:16:24.639
I was fitting my spiritual life around my work life, and not the other way around.

00:16:24.639 --> 00:16:32.049
I excused myself saying, I'm just working, it's a profession.

00:16:32.049 --> 00:16:35.049
Yes, it's time-consuming.

00:16:35.049 --> 00:16:45.659
But of short duration, because athletes retire earlier, the closer I drew to Jehovah,

00:16:45.659 --> 00:16:48.659
the stronger my inner conflicts became.

00:16:48.659 --> 00:17:00.299
The circuit overseer who served the area I was associated with helped me.

00:17:00.299 --> 00:17:03.299
I had known him since I was a child.

00:17:03.299 --> 00:17:11.609
When we met again, the first thing he asked me was, are you happy with what you are doing?

00:17:11.609 --> 00:17:17.490
Seems like a simple question, right?

00:17:17.490 --> 00:17:23.339
But this question went deeper.

00:17:23.339 --> 00:17:33.019
I'm very grateful to him and his wife for all the time they devoted to me.

00:17:33.019 --> 00:17:41.019
They were very busy, but even on their day off, or in the evenings, after long days of activity,

00:17:41.019 --> 00:17:43.019
they spent time with me.

00:17:43.019 --> 00:17:48.019
In time, I moved to different cities and changed to various teams.

00:17:48.019 --> 00:17:53.019
So he entrusted me, so to speak, to two other families.

00:17:53.019 --> 00:17:56.019
They poured themselves out for me.

00:17:56.019 --> 00:17:59.019
Sacrificing their time.

00:17:59.019 --> 00:18:04.019
Without ever making me feel bad for what I did.

00:18:04.019 --> 00:18:09.019
With regards to decisions about basketball, they never told me what to do.

00:18:09.019 --> 00:18:17.019
I had to reach that decision on my own, whether I should continue playing or not.

00:18:17.019 --> 00:18:22.019
It was their way of life that corrected me, so to speak.

00:18:23.019 --> 00:18:29.019
Their example, their lifestyle, their priorities, they said.

00:18:29.019 --> 00:18:34.019
And the joy they had in doing what they did, helped me.

00:18:34.019 --> 00:18:41.509
It was more their example than their words.

00:18:41.509 --> 00:18:51.339
It helped me understand what I really wanted from my life.

00:18:51.339 --> 00:19:00.339
I started in 1995 and continued until April 2008, when I played my last match.

00:19:00.339 --> 00:19:07.930
I, let's say, made a cut and quit playing basketball.

00:19:07.930 --> 00:19:10.930
I'm glad I made it.

00:19:10.930 --> 00:19:15.930
Sometimes I say to myself, if only I had done it earlier.

00:19:15.930 --> 00:19:20.210
If only I had had the courage earlier.

00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:25.210
I had the privilege of serving as a regular pioneer for two and a half years.

00:19:25.210 --> 00:19:33.339
I was asked if I would like to apply for better service.

00:19:33.339 --> 00:19:40.619
And to my surprise, I was invited to the Italy branch and served there for five years.

00:19:40.619 --> 00:19:47.619
A few months after leaving Bethel, I had the privilege of attending the school for Kingdom Evangelises.

00:19:47.619 --> 00:19:49.619
It was wonderful.

00:19:49.619 --> 00:20:01.160
This sport, basketball, it's great, it's thrilling, it's exciting, but it's not the source of true happiness.

00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:09.160
It's true. The world can give you a measure of satisfaction, but everything comes at a cost.

00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:16.490
But it took me a long time to understand this.

00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:23.490
Knowing that I'm giving Jehovah my best has made me happy.

00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:28.490
Yes, there is a team, a large one, and we all play for Jehovah.

00:20:28.490 --> 00:20:34.490
And its goal is beautiful, it's exciting, and its success is sure.

00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:43.180
Samuel A said he'd wished he had given up basketball earlier to pursue spiritual goals.

00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:50.180
From that we learned that decisions to spend time on personal interest, take away from time we should give to Jehovah.

00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:54.180
The sooner we appreciate Jehovah's patience,

00:20:54.180 --> 00:21:00.180
the sooner we enjoy the blessings which make us truly rich.

00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:07.180
We're happy that Jehovah exercised patience with Brother Podesta and helped him to regain his balance.

00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:19.619
If you're facing a career decision, be assured that when we focus first on serving Jehovah and teaching others his word, we're happier.

00:21:19.619 --> 00:21:25.619
Samuel A was influenced by the patience and good example of loving brothers.

00:21:25.619 --> 00:21:31.619
When we see how others are handling situations, we may not be as patient as we'd like to be.

00:21:31.619 --> 00:21:36.619
That's what happens to Nida and Jade in the following dramatization.

00:21:36.619 --> 00:22:18.410
How do they learn to be more patient with each other?

00:22:18.410 --> 00:22:23.200
You're late. I said you're late.

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:24.200
Sorry.

00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:58.380
You work here now?

00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:03.240
Yeah, just a few weeks.

00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:09.720
You look great.

00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:11.720
What kind of get you?

00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:20.869
I tried texting, you know, after you ended it.

00:23:20.869 --> 00:23:22.869
Try last day. That was your favourite.

00:23:22.869 --> 00:23:37.019
Jade, you were my favourite.

00:23:37.019 --> 00:23:40.019
Olli, you know why I had to...

00:23:40.019 --> 00:23:49.849
I know, but I want to study your religion.

00:23:49.849 --> 00:23:51.849
That's what I texted.

00:23:51.849 --> 00:23:58.220
Well, I got a new phone and I didn't see them.

00:23:58.220 --> 00:24:10.650
Okay, but how about I leave you my number and we can meet up.

00:24:10.650 --> 00:24:12.650
That's when you walked away.

00:24:12.650 --> 00:24:14.650
Tell me you walked away.

00:24:14.650 --> 00:24:18.890
He gave me his number.

00:24:18.890 --> 00:24:20.890
What?

00:24:20.890 --> 00:24:22.890
No.

00:24:22.890 --> 00:24:26.890
Jade, he said he wants to study.

00:24:26.890 --> 00:24:29.890
Yeah, he wants to study you.

00:24:29.890 --> 00:24:32.890
We can't read hearts.

00:24:32.890 --> 00:24:34.890
I think I can read yours.

00:24:34.890 --> 00:24:43.009
He was sweet.

00:24:43.009 --> 00:24:49.009
And if he wants to know the truth,

00:24:49.009 --> 00:24:51.009
I...

00:24:51.009 --> 00:24:53.009
I can't even believe this.

00:24:53.009 --> 00:24:58.430
What does it say?

00:24:58.430 --> 00:25:02.259
It says low battery.

00:25:02.259 --> 00:25:03.259
No.

00:25:03.259 --> 00:25:04.259
What the?

00:25:04.259 --> 00:25:05.259
This.

00:25:05.259 --> 00:25:09.299
Second Corinthians 614.

00:25:09.299 --> 00:25:13.299
Do not become unevenly yoked with unbelievers.

00:25:13.299 --> 00:25:15.299
There was no yoking.

00:25:15.299 --> 00:25:16.299
I haven't yoked.

00:25:16.299 --> 00:25:19.299
But this opens the door to the yok.

00:25:19.299 --> 00:25:20.299
I'm not stupid.

00:25:20.299 --> 00:25:22.299
You act like I don't know this.

00:25:22.299 --> 00:25:35.359
No, you act like you don't know this.

00:25:35.359 --> 00:25:38.359
That's a lot of backstory.

00:25:38.359 --> 00:25:40.359
You asked what happened.

00:25:40.359 --> 00:25:42.359
I thought you're like, you know,

00:25:42.359 --> 00:25:44.359
something up in a word or something.

00:25:44.359 --> 00:25:47.769
Anyway, now you know.

00:25:47.769 --> 00:25:54.490
So, are you gonna call him then?

00:25:54.490 --> 00:25:57.490
I don't think so.

00:25:57.490 --> 00:25:58.490
Why not?

00:25:58.490 --> 00:26:05.019
Because I don't think it's religion that he's interested in.

00:26:05.019 --> 00:26:30.670
I could have told you that.

00:26:30.670 --> 00:26:31.670
I made you a cup.

00:26:31.670 --> 00:26:39.680
Thanks.

00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:40.680
You're amazing.

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:43.150
Listen.

00:26:43.150 --> 00:26:46.849
I'm sorry.

00:26:46.849 --> 00:26:52.240
I know I came all strong.

00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:53.240
No.

00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:59.079
You were right.

00:26:59.079 --> 00:27:02.079
But I could have been more patient.

00:27:02.079 --> 00:27:05.809
I reacted too quickly.

00:27:05.809 --> 00:27:10.599
I know you know what the right thing to do is.

00:27:10.599 --> 00:27:13.599
I should have given you more time to talk out.

00:27:13.599 --> 00:27:19.569
I called brother Davies

00:27:19.569 --> 00:27:22.880
and gave him the background

00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:25.880
and said if he's really interested,

00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:26.880
he'll have a study.

00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:34.019
Then I deleted all his number.

00:27:34.019 --> 00:27:36.019
I knew it.

00:27:36.019 --> 00:27:39.839
I knew you'd do the right thing.

00:27:39.839 --> 00:27:40.839
Sometimes.

00:27:40.839 --> 00:27:46.210
But I should have been more patient.

00:27:46.210 --> 00:27:48.210
And I should have heard you out.

00:27:48.210 --> 00:27:57.460
It's just not what I wanted to hear in the moment.

00:27:57.460 --> 00:27:58.460
So we're good?

00:27:58.460 --> 00:27:59.460
Always.

00:28:02.859 --> 00:28:05.859
No more apologizing until I finish this coffee.

00:28:05.859 --> 00:28:11.420
It's too painful.

00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:19.529
It's so nice.

00:28:19.529 --> 00:28:23.529
Haven't we enjoyed the journey of Nita and Jade?

00:28:23.529 --> 00:28:26.529
From when they first appeared in our convention videos,

00:28:26.529 --> 00:28:28.529
up to these latest episodes,

00:28:28.529 --> 00:28:32.529
they've encountered situations we can all relate to.

00:28:32.529 --> 00:28:33.529
Jade.

00:28:33.529 --> 00:28:37.529
Progressing from Bible student to Bible teacher.

00:28:37.529 --> 00:28:40.529
Learning to reject falsehoods about Jehovah's people.

00:28:41.529 --> 00:28:44.529
And refining qualities like patience.

00:28:44.529 --> 00:28:48.529
Nita has grown as a disciple maker

00:28:48.529 --> 00:28:51.529
and as a caring spiritual sister.

00:28:51.529 --> 00:28:54.529
The encouraging lesson for us.

00:28:54.529 --> 00:29:00.380
Keep growing as a spiritual person.

00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:03.380
Putting on the new personality isn't easy.

00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:08.380
It can seem insurmountable for those in the grip of an addiction.

00:29:08.380 --> 00:29:11.380
We'll see this in our next video.

00:29:11.380 --> 00:29:13.380
What helps to cave?

00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:17.890
Break free from compulsive gambling.

00:29:17.890 --> 00:29:21.890
God left us when I was around five years old.

00:29:21.890 --> 00:29:25.710
Then when I was 15,

00:29:25.710 --> 00:29:30.410
we found out Mum had cancer.

00:29:30.410 --> 00:29:33.410
And she passed away six months later.

00:29:33.410 --> 00:29:36.410
She was only 39.

00:29:36.410 --> 00:29:40.410
My two younger brothers were still in elementary school.

00:29:40.410 --> 00:29:43.410
So I woke up early, did the milk rounds,

00:29:44.410 --> 00:29:46.410
woke in a factory during the day

00:29:46.410 --> 00:29:49.980
and went to school at night.

00:29:49.980 --> 00:29:51.980
My life was super busy then.

00:29:51.980 --> 00:29:58.259
My life became significantly easier after marriage.

00:29:58.259 --> 00:30:00.259
Since my wife did the housework,

00:30:00.259 --> 00:30:04.920
all I needed to do was work.

00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:12.059
Before I was so busy that I never really got to have any fun.

00:30:12.059 --> 00:30:14.059
One day,

00:30:14.059 --> 00:30:20.619
a friend took me to a betting shop for horse racing.

00:30:20.619 --> 00:30:22.619
And to my surprise,

00:30:22.619 --> 00:30:25.619
I got lucky.

00:30:25.619 --> 00:30:28.619
I was surprised that you can buy a ticket

00:30:28.619 --> 00:30:32.619
and then you get all this money in your hands.

00:30:32.619 --> 00:30:39.420
So that's how it started.

00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:41.420
It gradually became worse.

00:30:41.420 --> 00:30:44.420
To the point that I would get off the night shift

00:30:44.420 --> 00:30:47.420
and go straight to the races,

00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:51.420
I loved gambling more than eating and sleeping.

00:30:51.420 --> 00:30:57.200
On my way home,

00:30:57.200 --> 00:31:01.200
images of my wife and children would come to my mind.

00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:03.200
And I had this nagging feeling

00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:07.200
that I really should be getting my life together.

00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:09.200
When I was broke,

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:12.200
I would go to the pawn shops.

00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:17.829
I pawned our camera and even my wife's jewelry.

00:31:17.829 --> 00:31:20.829
My wife started studying the Bible.

00:31:20.829 --> 00:31:24.829
And to try and make my wife and children a little happy,

00:31:24.829 --> 00:31:28.240
I also agreed to a study.

00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:30.240
Before I started gambling,

00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:32.240
I liked growing vegetables.

00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:36.940
You know, everything a vegetable needs.

00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:38.940
All the instructions to grow

00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:40.940
is in this tiny seat

00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:43.940
that is one or two millimeters in size.

00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:46.940
I knew that couldn't just happen by chance.

00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:51.470
I was convinced

00:31:51.470 --> 00:31:54.470
that there must be a God.

00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:56.470
Through my Bible study,

00:31:56.470 --> 00:31:59.470
I learned that this God is Jehovah,

00:31:59.470 --> 00:32:02.470
and that made me really happy.

00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:03.470
I found you.

00:32:03.470 --> 00:32:05.470
That's how I felt.

00:32:05.470 --> 00:32:09.470
However, it was really difficult to quit gambling.

00:32:09.470 --> 00:32:13.470
You know, many times I wanted to quit,

00:32:13.470 --> 00:32:15.470
and I would pay back my loans,

00:32:15.470 --> 00:32:18.470
but then take out some more again.

00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:21.470
My wife's relative said to me,

00:32:21.470 --> 00:32:23.470
only death can cure you.

00:32:23.470 --> 00:32:28.349
So I had this conviction

00:32:28.349 --> 00:32:30.349
that the Creator exists,

00:32:30.349 --> 00:32:32.349
and yet on the other hand,

00:32:32.349 --> 00:32:34.349
I was deep into gambling.

00:32:34.349 --> 00:32:36.349
I knew Jehovah saw it all,

00:32:36.349 --> 00:32:38.349
and I hated myself.

00:32:38.349 --> 00:32:41.660
I attended a circuit assembly

00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:43.660
for the first time,

00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:49.500
put away the old personality

00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:52.500
and put on the new personality.

00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:55.500
As I was reading those words from the Bible,

00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:58.500
I felt that was about me.

00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:00.500
When I asked myself,

00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:03.500
hey, what's happening to my life right now?

00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:05.500
I saw how horrible

00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:09.500
and ugly my mindset was.

00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:12.500
I felt tears well up.

00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:16.500
I knew this was Jehovah talking to me,

00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:18.500
and I felt determined

00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:20.500
to do something about it.

00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:24.980
I couldn't do it on my own.

00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:26.980
So I prayed to Jehovah

00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:28.980
from the bottom of my heart,

00:33:28.980 --> 00:33:32.289
saying, I really want to stop.

00:33:32.289 --> 00:33:35.289
No matter what.

00:33:35.289 --> 00:33:37.289
I want to hate gambling,

00:33:37.289 --> 00:33:39.289
and not just avoid it.

00:33:39.289 --> 00:33:42.289
Please give me this feeling of hate.

00:33:42.289 --> 00:33:45.289
I prayed like this every day.

00:33:45.289 --> 00:33:49.099
Since then,

00:33:49.099 --> 00:33:53.900
I have felt zero desire to gamble.

00:33:53.900 --> 00:33:57.779
There was one time during work

00:33:57.779 --> 00:33:59.779
when I passed by a racetrack.

00:33:59.779 --> 00:34:04.059
I loved bicycle racing before,

00:34:04.059 --> 00:34:07.059
but now I felt this deep revulsion.

00:34:07.059 --> 00:34:17.550
I knew my prayers were answered.

00:34:17.550 --> 00:34:22.440
I felt Jehovah's patience

00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:25.440
and so much appreciation

00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:32.380
for how he allowed me in,

00:34:32.380 --> 00:34:42.739
knowing who I was.

00:34:42.739 --> 00:34:44.739
If I had continued that path,

00:34:44.739 --> 00:34:48.739
I'm sure my family would have broken apart.

00:34:48.739 --> 00:34:53.699
My relatives are all surprised at me.

00:34:53.699 --> 00:34:55.699
I'm sure those trying to stop gambling

00:34:55.699 --> 00:34:57.699
have many concerns,

00:34:57.699 --> 00:34:59.699
but as long as you have that desire

00:34:59.699 --> 00:35:02.699
to pour out those feelings to Jehovah

00:35:02.699 --> 00:35:04.699
and jump into his arms,

00:35:04.699 --> 00:35:06.699
you'll take you in.

00:35:06.699 --> 00:35:08.699
He won't leave you.

00:35:08.699 --> 00:35:11.699
I really want them to know Jehovah

00:35:11.699 --> 00:35:13.699
as that kind of person.

00:35:13.699 --> 00:35:18.960
How encouraging.

00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:20.960
If you're fighting an addiction,

00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:22.960
don't give up.

00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:24.960
Pour your heart out to Jehovah

00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:26.960
and ask for his help.

00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:29.960
Don't be discouraged if you suffer setbacks.

00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:32.960
Jehovah will be patient with you

00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:35.960
as he was with Teke.

00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:37.960
Did you notice that our brother's addiction

00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:39.960
began subtly?

00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:44.960
If only he had detected the early warning signs.

00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:47.960
How can we remain alert

00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:50.960
and safeguard our heart?

00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:52.960
Let's find out in this Bethel morning worship

00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:54.960
with Brother David's plane,

00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:57.960
a member of the governing body.

00:35:57.960 --> 00:36:02.960
Solomon had three horrible half-brothers,

00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:06.960
Amnon, Adonijah,

00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:09.960
and Absalom.

00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:11.960
They were a lot older than he was,

00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:14.960
but Solomon didn't try to imitate them,

00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:16.960
and he didn't allow himself to be stumbled

00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:19.960
by their bad conduct.

00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:20.960
As if to say,

00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:21.960
well, if that's the kind of people

00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:22.960
they have around here,

00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:24.960
I want nothing to do with Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:28.960
No Solomon followed his own path.

00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:31.960
He developed a strong personal relationship

00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:33.960
with Jehovah God.

00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:36.960
And remember what the Bible says about Solomon

00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:38.960
in the beginning?

00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:41.960
Jehovah loved him.

00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:42.960
Isn't that nice?

00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:46.960
Wouldn't you love it if that were said about you, I would?

00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:49.960
Jehovah loved Solomon.

00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:52.960
And Jehovah blessed Solomon in many ways.

00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:55.960
For example, while Solomon was faithful,

00:36:55.960 --> 00:36:57.960
Israel was at peace.

00:36:57.960 --> 00:36:58.960
In fact, Solomon said,

00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:01.960
Jehovah, my God, has given me rest all around.

00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:03.960
There is no one opposing me,

00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:09.960
and I have nothing bad is happening.

00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:12.960
So it was only after Solomon became unfaithful

00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:16.960
that resistors were raised up in Israel.

00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:18.960
Not only was Israel at peace

00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:21.960
when Solomon was at peace with God,

00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:23.960
but Israel was rich.

00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:26.960
Solomon had no financial problems.

00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:30.960
The Bible says that the silver was as common as the stones.

00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:34.960
But when Solomon started drawing away from Jehovah,

00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:36.960
Jehovah withdrew his blessing.

00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:38.960
And so that prosperity didn't last

00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:41.960
even during Solomon's reign.

00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:44.960
Insight tells us there was a drain

00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:46.960
on Israel's economy.

00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:48.960
A Solomon was still spending money

00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:50.960
as if it were going out of style.

00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:53.960
But he didn't have the income that he once had.

00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:55.960
And so even materially,

00:37:55.960 --> 00:37:57.960
Israel suffered,

00:37:57.960 --> 00:38:00.960
and Reaborm did not inherit the wealth from Solomon

00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:04.960
that Solomon had had at the peak of his reign.

00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:07.960
Now, as our comment points out for much of his reign,

00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:10.960
Solomon did a lot of good things.

00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:14.960
But is it possible that right from the beginning,

00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:18.960
as involved as Solomon was in theocratic projects,

00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:21.960
there was a little red flag

00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:25.960
that something wasn't quite right?

00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:27.960
It's possible.

00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:29.960
Now, as our comment points out,

00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:31.960
when Solomon became king,

00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:32.960
he was a young man,

00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:36.960
but he was a young married man.

00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:37.960
In fact, when he became king,

00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:39.960
Solomon had probably been married

00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:41.960
for a couple of years already.

00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:42.960
He had a little boy.

00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:43.960
He was a daddy.

00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:44.960
He had a little boy,

00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:47.960
one year old, Reaborm.

00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:50.960
But who was his wife?

00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:53.960
Probably his first wife.

00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:57.960
She was an ammonitis.

00:38:57.960 --> 00:38:59.960
Ammonitis.

00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:02.960
What do we remember about ammonitis?

00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:03.960
Oh, yes.

00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:13.340
Deuteronomy chapter 23 and verse 3.

00:39:13.340 --> 00:39:15.340
Now, remember, when Solomon gets married,

00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:17.340
King David is still alive.

00:39:17.340 --> 00:39:19.340
David is probably at the wedding.

00:39:19.340 --> 00:39:22.340
Now, here's what Deuteronomy 23 says.

00:39:23.340 --> 00:39:26.340
No ammonite or Moabite

00:39:26.340 --> 00:39:29.340
may come into the congregation of Jehovah.

00:39:29.340 --> 00:39:32.340
Even to the 10th generation,

00:39:32.340 --> 00:39:34.340
none of their descendants

00:39:34.340 --> 00:39:39.340
may ever come into the congregation of Jehovah.

00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:44.340
What part of never did Solomon not understand?

00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:49.340
So could that mean that even before he became king,

00:39:49.340 --> 00:39:51.340
Solomon had a casual view

00:39:52.340 --> 00:39:54.340
of Jehovah's laws on marriage.

00:39:54.340 --> 00:39:56.340
It's possible.

00:39:56.340 --> 00:39:59.340
Well, why do we say possible?

00:39:59.340 --> 00:40:01.340
Well, without being dogmatic,

00:40:01.340 --> 00:40:03.340
Insight says that there may have been exceptions

00:40:03.340 --> 00:40:07.340
for foreign women like Ruth the Moabitis.

00:40:07.340 --> 00:40:12.340
But Insight also says that Solomon's ammonite wife

00:40:12.340 --> 00:40:15.340
possibly contributed to his apostasy.

00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:19.340
In any event, why was the first wife

00:40:19.340 --> 00:40:25.869
a foreign woman and an animitis to boot?

00:40:25.869 --> 00:40:29.869
Now, if Solomon had married a nice Jewish girl,

00:40:29.869 --> 00:40:33.869
just one, and rejoiced with the wife of his youth,

00:40:33.869 --> 00:40:35.869
don't you think that the history of Israel

00:40:35.869 --> 00:40:37.869
would have been much different?

00:40:37.869 --> 00:40:39.869
I think it would have been.

00:40:39.869 --> 00:40:41.869
Now, let's take a moment to think about the women

00:40:41.869 --> 00:40:46.869
Solomon did marry, pagan women.

00:40:46.869 --> 00:40:49.869
Now, you may have relatives who are not in the truth.

00:40:49.869 --> 00:40:53.869
You love your relatives and you go visit from time to time.

00:40:53.869 --> 00:40:57.869
But how long is it before you run out of things to talk about?

00:40:57.869 --> 00:41:01.869
Because we just don't have the most important thing in common,

00:41:01.869 --> 00:41:03.869
the truth.

00:41:03.869 --> 00:41:05.869
So we have to ask,

00:41:05.869 --> 00:41:10.869
why was Solomon so comfortable with these pagan women?

00:41:10.869 --> 00:41:12.869
What did he talk about?

00:41:12.869 --> 00:41:16.869
Well, you can be sure he wasn't studying the watchtower with them.

00:41:16.869 --> 00:41:18.869
But what was he doing?

00:41:18.869 --> 00:41:21.869
What was the attraction to these foreign women?

00:41:21.869 --> 00:41:24.869
Was it their humility,

00:41:24.869 --> 00:41:27.869
their modest dress,

00:41:27.869 --> 00:41:29.869
their chased conduct,

00:41:29.869 --> 00:41:32.869
their quiet and mild spirit,

00:41:32.869 --> 00:41:36.869
or was it mainly the physical?

00:41:36.869 --> 00:41:38.869
Let's be blunt.

00:41:38.869 --> 00:41:43.869
Solomon was attracted to the wrong kind of woman,

00:41:44.869 --> 00:41:47.869
and there may have been early warning signs.

00:41:47.869 --> 00:41:49.869
Speaking of red flags,

00:41:49.869 --> 00:41:52.869
when Solomon began marrying many women,

00:41:52.869 --> 00:41:55.869
I did a prophet or a priest ever approach him

00:41:55.869 --> 00:41:57.869
and give him some counsel.

00:41:57.869 --> 00:42:00.869
Did they ever read to Deuteronomy 17, 17,

00:42:00.869 --> 00:42:03.869
which applied directly to the king?

00:42:03.869 --> 00:42:06.869
Deuteronomy 17, 17?

00:42:06.869 --> 00:42:08.869
It says about the king,

00:42:08.869 --> 00:42:11.869
neither should he take many wives for himself,

00:42:11.869 --> 00:42:16.869
so that his heart may not go astray.

00:42:16.869 --> 00:42:18.869
Well, if he did receive that counsel,

00:42:18.869 --> 00:42:20.869
he certainly didn't apply it.

00:42:20.869 --> 00:42:22.869
And if he didn't receive that counsel,

00:42:22.869 --> 00:42:25.869
we wonder why not.

00:42:25.869 --> 00:42:27.869
Well, what's the application?

00:42:27.869 --> 00:42:31.869
Today, we may be very busy in Jehovah's Organization,

00:42:31.869 --> 00:42:35.869
but we have to be alert to any red flags

00:42:35.869 --> 00:42:37.869
that, despite outward appearances,

00:42:37.869 --> 00:42:40.869
all is not well with us.

00:42:41.869 --> 00:42:44.869
A single brother is a regular publisher.

00:42:44.869 --> 00:42:46.869
He is a regular meeting attender,

00:42:46.869 --> 00:42:48.869
but on his night, nights off,

00:42:48.869 --> 00:42:50.869
he likes to go to nightclubs,

00:42:50.869 --> 00:42:53.869
and he's comfortable in that atmosphere.

00:42:53.869 --> 00:42:56.869
He isn't shy about striking up conversations

00:42:56.869 --> 00:42:58.869
with worldly people,

00:42:58.869 --> 00:42:59.869
and he loves to dance.

00:42:59.869 --> 00:43:01.869
Well, there are no sisters there,

00:43:01.869 --> 00:43:04.869
so he dances with worldly women.

00:43:04.869 --> 00:43:06.869
What's the attraction?

00:43:06.869 --> 00:43:08.869
He's busy in the congregation,

00:43:08.869 --> 00:43:10.869
but there's something there

00:43:10.869 --> 00:43:13.869
that isn't quite right.

00:43:13.869 --> 00:43:16.869
A young pioneer brother loves to flirt.

00:43:16.869 --> 00:43:20.869
Several young sisters think he's interested only in them.

00:43:20.869 --> 00:43:24.869
The attention makes him feel special.

00:43:24.869 --> 00:43:28.869
A ministerial servant spends a lot of time

00:43:28.869 --> 00:43:31.869
talking to a married woman.

00:43:31.869 --> 00:43:32.869
When he's asked about it,

00:43:32.869 --> 00:43:33.869
he justifies it and says,

00:43:33.869 --> 00:43:35.869
we're just friends.

00:43:35.869 --> 00:43:37.869
We're just talking.

00:43:37.869 --> 00:43:39.869
Famous last words.

00:43:39.869 --> 00:43:42.869
A fine young sister is offended

00:43:42.869 --> 00:43:44.869
when an older sister approaches her

00:43:44.869 --> 00:43:46.869
and points out that her skirts

00:43:46.869 --> 00:43:51.869
and jeans are too tight to revealing.

00:43:51.869 --> 00:43:54.869
Well, all these are red flags.

00:43:54.869 --> 00:43:56.869
We need to examine ourselves from time to time

00:43:56.869 --> 00:43:57.869
to see whether,

00:43:57.869 --> 00:44:00.869
no matter how many privileges we have,

00:44:00.869 --> 00:44:04.869
something isn't quite right.

00:44:04.869 --> 00:44:06.869
When it comes to choosing a mate,

00:44:06.869 --> 00:44:10.869
Solomon's example can be instructive to us.

00:44:10.869 --> 00:44:13.869
How what qualities do we value in a marriage mate?

00:44:13.869 --> 00:44:15.869
Spiritual qualities?

00:44:15.869 --> 00:44:17.869
Or is it mainly the physical?

00:44:17.869 --> 00:44:21.869
And we hope that the spiritual will catch up later.

00:44:21.869 --> 00:44:24.869
A young sister is getting acquainted with a young brother.

00:44:24.869 --> 00:44:26.869
He's really good-looking.

00:44:26.869 --> 00:44:29.869
Has a great personality that gets along with everybody.

00:44:29.869 --> 00:44:32.869
But how's he doing spiritually?

00:44:32.869 --> 00:44:35.869
Does he have a good schedule for theocratic activities?

00:44:35.869 --> 00:44:37.869
And does he stick to it?

00:44:37.869 --> 00:44:40.869
For example, if you mention an article in a recent magazine,

00:44:40.869 --> 00:44:42.869
does he often say,

00:44:42.869 --> 00:44:45.869
I must have missed that one.

00:44:45.869 --> 00:44:47.869
And that's what happens.

00:44:47.869 --> 00:44:49.869
It's a bad sign.

00:44:49.869 --> 00:44:53.869
Does he make spiritual activities a priority in his life?

00:44:53.869 --> 00:44:55.869
If he doesn't do that while he's single,

00:44:55.869 --> 00:44:57.869
what makes you think that he's going to do it

00:44:57.869 --> 00:44:59.869
after you get married?

00:44:59.869 --> 00:45:01.869
Will you change him?

00:45:01.869 --> 00:45:04.869
Or will he change you?

00:45:04.869 --> 00:45:06.869
As our comment reminds us,

00:45:06.869 --> 00:45:09.869
Solomon enjoyed many privileges.

00:45:09.869 --> 00:45:11.869
But he apparently felt that some of God's laws

00:45:11.869 --> 00:45:13.869
just didn't apply to him.

00:45:13.869 --> 00:45:14.869
Why not?

00:45:14.869 --> 00:45:15.869
Well, we don't know.

00:45:15.869 --> 00:45:18.869
Could it be what Solomon said in Ecclesiastes?

00:45:18.869 --> 00:45:21.869
The King does whatever he wants?

00:45:21.869 --> 00:45:23.869
Maybe so.

00:45:23.869 --> 00:45:28.869
Solomon multiplied horses and acquired many wives for himself.

00:45:28.869 --> 00:45:31.869
So what's the lesson for us?

00:45:31.869 --> 00:45:33.869
No matter how long we've been in the truth,

00:45:33.869 --> 00:45:35.869
no matter how many privileges we have,

00:45:35.869 --> 00:45:38.869
no matter how much Jehovah has used us,

00:45:38.869 --> 00:45:41.869
we can't afford to let down our guard.

00:45:41.869 --> 00:45:44.869
We must guard our heart.

00:45:44.869 --> 00:45:47.869
And we mustn't ignore any red flags

00:45:47.869 --> 00:45:51.869
that might indicate that all is not well.

00:45:51.869 --> 00:45:54.869
Theocratic conventions are a spiritual highlight

00:45:54.869 --> 00:45:56.869
of every year.

00:45:56.869 --> 00:45:59.869
They play an important role in fostering unity

00:45:59.869 --> 00:46:02.869
and love among Jehovah's people.

00:46:02.869 --> 00:46:05.869
In this episode of Our History and Motion,

00:46:05.869 --> 00:46:07.869
let's explore how conventions have become

00:46:07.869 --> 00:46:13.889
an essential part of modern day worship.

00:46:13.889 --> 00:46:15.889
Good morning, brothers and sisters.

00:46:15.889 --> 00:46:17.889
How delightful it is to be gathered together

00:46:17.889 --> 00:46:20.889
for this spiritual occasion.

00:46:22.889 --> 00:46:25.889
Jehovah's Witnesses love gathering at conventions

00:46:25.889 --> 00:46:29.889
to learn, worship, and sing together.

00:46:29.889 --> 00:46:31.889
But large conventions like these

00:46:31.889 --> 00:46:34.889
with tens of thousands beating together

00:46:34.889 --> 00:46:37.889
weren't always a part of our modern day worship.

00:46:37.889 --> 00:46:39.889
How did they get started?

00:46:39.889 --> 00:46:44.889
Let's find out in this episode of Our History and Motion.

00:46:44.889 --> 00:46:55.949
The very first large assembly of Jehovah's people

00:46:55.949 --> 00:46:58.949
was actually held thousands of years ago.

00:46:58.949 --> 00:47:01.949
When the Israelites gathered with Moses

00:47:01.949 --> 00:47:04.949
at Mount Sinai for spiritual instruction.

00:47:04.949 --> 00:47:08.949
After that, the Israelites attended three festivals

00:47:08.949 --> 00:47:11.949
each year, and just like today's conventions,

00:47:11.949 --> 00:47:14.949
those gatherings brought people together

00:47:14.949 --> 00:47:18.949
from different tribes to praise him as one big family.

00:47:18.949 --> 00:47:21.949
In modern times, our first conventions were held

00:47:21.949 --> 00:47:25.949
in the late 1880s, but they weren't exactly

00:47:25.949 --> 00:47:28.949
what we'd think of as conventions today.

00:47:28.949 --> 00:47:30.949
With just a few hundred in attendance,

00:47:30.949 --> 00:47:32.949
they were really just big meetings

00:47:32.949 --> 00:47:34.949
that brought the Bible students together

00:47:34.949 --> 00:47:37.949
to commemorate the Lord's evening meal.

00:47:37.949 --> 00:47:42.949
And they were all held in Allegheny, Pennsylvania, USA.

00:47:42.949 --> 00:47:46.949
But that changed in 1893,

00:47:46.949 --> 00:47:49.949
with the opening of the Chicago World's Fair.

00:47:49.949 --> 00:47:51.949
The fair drew millions of people,

00:47:51.949 --> 00:47:54.949
and with the railroads offering discounted rates

00:47:54.949 --> 00:47:58.949
to Chicago, the Bible students saw it as a perfect opportunity

00:47:58.949 --> 00:48:00.949
to invite the brothers and sisters

00:48:00.949 --> 00:48:03.949
for a five-day convention.

00:48:03.949 --> 00:48:06.949
About 360 attended,

00:48:06.949 --> 00:48:10.949
a small crowd by today's standards.

00:48:10.949 --> 00:48:12.949
But early conventions like this one

00:48:12.949 --> 00:48:15.949
helped the Bible students see just how

00:48:15.949 --> 00:48:17.949
a building it was to meet with fellow believers

00:48:17.949 --> 00:48:20.949
from other areas.

00:48:20.949 --> 00:48:25.949
Eventually, conventions became an annual event.

00:48:25.949 --> 00:48:28.949
Some were held outdoors, or in a tent,

00:48:28.949 --> 00:48:31.949
like the 1908 Convention at Putin Bay,

00:48:31.949 --> 00:48:34.949
a summer resort on Lake Iriohio.

00:48:34.949 --> 00:48:37.949
This convention was ten days long,

00:48:37.949 --> 00:48:40.949
and it was the largest up to that time,

00:48:40.949 --> 00:48:45.949
with an estimated 3,500 or more in attendance.

00:48:45.949 --> 00:48:47.949
It was a chance for brothers and sisters,

00:48:47.949 --> 00:48:50.949
young and old, to be spiritually refreshed,

00:48:50.949 --> 00:48:54.949
spend time together, laugh together, eat together,

00:48:54.949 --> 00:48:58.949
and build true bonds of friendship and love.

00:48:58.949 --> 00:49:03.679
The world then suffered the devastating effects

00:49:03.679 --> 00:49:08.679
of World War I and the deadly 1918 influenza pandemic

00:49:08.679 --> 00:49:12.679
that had taken an estimated 50 million lives.

00:49:12.679 --> 00:49:15.679
But that did not stop God's people.

00:49:15.679 --> 00:49:18.679
Our bonds of love became even more evident

00:49:18.679 --> 00:49:21.679
in 1919 at Cedar Point, Ohio.

00:49:21.679 --> 00:49:23.679
This was the first major convention held

00:49:23.679 --> 00:49:26.679
after brother Rutherford and his associates

00:49:26.679 --> 00:49:29.679
had been released from prison.

00:49:29.679 --> 00:49:32.679
Thrilled, to finally gather together safely,

00:49:32.679 --> 00:49:35.679
the Bible students just kept coming and coming

00:49:35.679 --> 00:49:38.679
until the entire program had to be moved outdoors

00:49:38.679 --> 00:49:41.679
with some 7,000 in attendance.

00:49:41.679 --> 00:49:47.630
Just three years later, in 1922,

00:49:47.630 --> 00:49:52.630
Cedar Point was the location of an even more exciting convention,

00:49:52.630 --> 00:49:57.630
with an average daily attendance of about 10,000.

00:49:57.630 --> 00:50:01.630
It energized God's people to go on preaching

00:50:01.630 --> 00:50:04.630
with renewed vigor.

00:50:04.630 --> 00:50:07.630
Many conventions in the years that followed

00:50:07.630 --> 00:50:11.630
help unite God's people in even more powerful ways,

00:50:11.630 --> 00:50:17.630
like the unforgettable one held in Columbus, Ohio in 1931.

00:50:17.630 --> 00:50:21.630
Imagine stepping into the Colosseum at the Fairgrounds.

00:50:21.630 --> 00:50:27.630
There are 15,000 in attendance and the places packed.

00:50:27.630 --> 00:50:31.630
Your program has two large letters printed on the front,

00:50:31.630 --> 00:50:35.630
J.W. For the first two days of the convention,

00:50:35.630 --> 00:50:39.630
everyone's trying to guess what those letters mean.

00:50:39.630 --> 00:50:42.630
Just watch. Just wait.

00:50:42.630 --> 00:50:46.630
Finally, brother Rutherford steps on stage.

00:50:46.630 --> 00:50:49.630
Near the end of his talk, he presents a resolution

00:50:49.630 --> 00:50:52.630
that climaxes with the words,

00:50:52.630 --> 00:50:55.630
we desire to be known as,

00:50:55.630 --> 00:51:00.630
and called by the name to wit Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:51:00.630 --> 00:51:10.050
In the 1940s, World War II had left many countries

00:51:10.050 --> 00:51:13.050
devastated and divided.

00:51:13.050 --> 00:51:18.050
But Jehovah's Witnesses were growing in number and in unity.

00:51:18.050 --> 00:51:22.050
In 1946, they gathered in Cleveland, Ohio

00:51:22.050 --> 00:51:25.050
for the Glad Nation's Theocratic Assembly,

00:51:25.050 --> 00:51:29.050
and the name couldn't have been more appropriate.

00:51:29.050 --> 00:51:33.050
It was a true international convention,

00:51:33.050 --> 00:51:38.050
with 55,000 delegates from 33 different nations.

00:51:38.050 --> 00:51:42.050
Some even camped in tents and trailers to be there.

00:51:42.050 --> 00:51:47.050
Tent cities were a common sight during big conventions of this era.

00:51:47.050 --> 00:51:51.050
With our spiritual family continuing to grow,

00:51:51.050 --> 00:51:56.050
conventions during the 1950s were held around the world,

00:51:56.050 --> 00:52:01.050
even in places where resources were limited.

00:52:01.050 --> 00:52:06.050
A landmark example of just how international conventions had become

00:52:06.050 --> 00:52:12.050
was the incredible 1958 Divine Will International Assembly in New York City,

00:52:12.050 --> 00:52:17.050
which was attended by more than a quarter of a million people

00:52:17.050 --> 00:52:20.050
from 123 lands.

00:52:20.050 --> 00:52:25.050
This was the largest international convention ever held in one city,

00:52:25.050 --> 00:52:30.050
filling Yankee Stadium and just four blocks away, the polo grounds.

00:52:30.050 --> 00:52:34.050
The greatest assembly of true Christians ever held is opening this day.

00:52:34.050 --> 00:52:42.619
We are certain that Jehovah is with us and that we are here by Divine Will.

00:52:42.619 --> 00:52:45.619
But what unified God's people at conventions like this one

00:52:45.619 --> 00:52:49.619
wasn't simply gathering together in large numbers.

00:52:49.619 --> 00:52:55.619
It was the spiritual content, riveting talks, practical symposiums,

00:52:55.619 --> 00:53:04.619
new releases and starting in the 1960s Bible dramas on stage in full costume.

00:53:04.619 --> 00:53:08.619
Those spiritual gifts along with the joy of meeting new friends

00:53:08.619 --> 00:53:16.019
and united with old ones have made assembling together a true blessing.

00:53:16.019 --> 00:53:18.019
But it hasn't always been easy.

00:53:18.019 --> 00:53:23.019
In the country of Georgia where witnesses had faced severe opposition,

00:53:23.019 --> 00:53:29.019
plans were set to hold the 2006 deliverance at hand district convention

00:53:29.019 --> 00:53:32.019
in the Tbilisi Philharmonic Concert Hall.

00:53:32.019 --> 00:53:39.019
But the hall management cancelled the contract just one week before the convention.

00:53:39.019 --> 00:53:45.019
With just days before the opening session, an army of determined brothers and sisters

00:53:45.019 --> 00:53:49.019
turned two plots of farmland into a convention site.

00:53:49.019 --> 00:53:52.019
Harvesting the potatoes planted on the property,

00:53:52.019 --> 00:53:59.019
building a stage in benches for seating and installing sound equipment.

00:53:59.019 --> 00:54:03.019
When it was time for the first session, everything was ready

00:54:03.019 --> 00:54:09.019
and more than 17,000 attended either on site or by telephone time.

00:54:09.019 --> 00:54:12.019
Not only did the convention come off without a hitch,

00:54:12.019 --> 00:54:17.019
but the attendees were overwhelmed with another unexpected blessing,

00:54:17.019 --> 00:54:20.019
the new world translation in Georgian,

00:54:20.019 --> 00:54:27.019
unifying them even further with their brothers and sisters around the world.

00:54:27.019 --> 00:54:31.019
In modern times like these, special and international conventions

00:54:31.019 --> 00:54:35.019
have been held in far-flung places around the world.

00:54:35.019 --> 00:54:41.019
And when it was impossible to meet in person, we've even met online.

00:54:41.019 --> 00:54:45.019
From Poland to Korea, from Australia to South Africa,

00:54:45.019 --> 00:54:52.019
conventions were and still are joyful spiritual occasions for all of God's people.

00:54:52.019 --> 00:54:55.019
They motivate and encourage us,

00:54:55.019 --> 00:54:58.019
United's brothers and sisters, and most importantly,

00:54:58.019 --> 00:55:01.019
draw us closer to Jehovah.

00:55:01.019 --> 00:55:11.480
When we gather as a United Spiritual family,

00:55:11.480 --> 00:55:14.480
it's a shout of praise to Jehovah.

00:55:14.480 --> 00:55:19.480
It's also powerful evidence that we are a loving brotherhood.

00:55:19.480 --> 00:55:23.480
Of course, we have to promote unity every day,

00:55:23.480 --> 00:55:28.480
especially when someone has heard our feelings and our patients has tested.

00:55:28.480 --> 00:55:33.480
But with Jehovah's help, we can become friends again,

00:55:33.480 --> 00:55:37.480
which is the appealing title of our new music video.

00:55:37.480 --> 00:55:41.480
Before we watch it, we want to show you a feature

00:55:41.480 --> 00:55:44.480
that may help you benefit more from the broadcast.

00:55:44.480 --> 00:55:49.480
Subtitles are available in a number of languages.

00:55:49.480 --> 00:55:52.480
If a video has subtitles for your language,

00:55:52.480 --> 00:55:55.480
you'll see this icon at the bottom of your screen.

00:55:55.480 --> 00:55:59.480
Click the icon to turn subtitles on and off.

00:55:59.480 --> 00:56:06.889
We're trying hard to help others find

00:56:06.889 --> 00:56:09.889
friends eternally.

00:56:09.889 --> 00:56:14.889
Now, please enjoy the music video, friends again.

00:59:13.849 --> 01:00:18.469
Our program has focused on the beautiful quality of patients.

01:00:18.469 --> 01:00:22.469
We learn to be patient with the way others handle situations.

01:00:22.469 --> 01:00:25.469
We saw how Jehovah is patient with us,

01:00:25.469 --> 01:00:28.469
as we free ourselves from destructive habits,

01:00:28.469 --> 01:00:31.469
and how our patients in love reassures others too.

01:00:31.469 --> 01:00:35.070
For this month's video postcard,

01:00:35.070 --> 01:00:39.070
we travel to Guatemala and Central America.

01:00:39.070 --> 01:00:42.070
What aspects of Jehovah's creation do you enjoy?

01:00:43.070 --> 01:00:44.070
Jungles?

01:00:45.070 --> 01:00:46.070
Beaches?

01:00:47.070 --> 01:00:48.070
Mountains?

01:00:49.070 --> 01:00:50.070
Rainforest?

01:00:51.070 --> 01:00:53.070
Guatemala has them all.

01:00:53.070 --> 01:00:55.070
It even has volcanoes.

01:00:55.070 --> 01:00:57.070
Lots of volcanoes.

01:00:57.070 --> 01:01:00.070
Southern Guatemala has a string of 27.

01:01:00.070 --> 01:01:05.320
The first missionaries arrived in 1945.

01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:10.320
By 1958, there were more than 700 witnesses in three circuits.

01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:13.320
Difficulties arose in the 1980s

01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:17.320
when the government organized armed civilians to patrol communities.

01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:20.320
Some of our brothers were threatened with death

01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:23.320
if they did not join the civil patrols.

01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:26.320
But they stood firm.

01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:33.320
Today, about 40,000 publishers serve in more than 850 congregations.

01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:37.320
Their preaching methods are as diverse as the geography.

01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:40.320
Guatemala's official language is Spanish,

01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:45.320
but more than 20 indigenous languages are also spoken there,

01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:47.320
including mom.

01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:52.320
More than 500 publishers and 20 congregations share the good news

01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:54.320
in the mom language.

01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:58.320
These brothers and sisters are among the 49 publishers

01:01:58.320 --> 01:02:03.320
in the Ulston Calco mom congregation and Ketzel Tanango.

01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:06.320
They send you their love and greetings.

01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:10.320
From the World Headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses,

01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:13.320
this is JW Broadcasting.
