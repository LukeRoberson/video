WEBVTT

00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:04.780
Good day, brothers and sisters.

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:08.779
No doubt you have been enjoying the music video presentations

00:00:08.779 --> 00:00:11.779
that have been prepared for this convention.

00:00:11.779 --> 00:00:14.779
Now it's time to enjoy the next one.

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:16.780
As you watch it,

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:39.600
notice the joy that comes from a life spent in Jehovah's service.

00:02:25.409 --> 00:09:45.019
Let us now stand and sing a song that reflects the joy we find when we preach and teach with zeal.

00:09:45.019 --> 00:09:52.019
Please stand and sing song number 76 entitled, How Does It Make You Feel?

00:09:52.019 --> 00:13:00.059
That song number 76. Please be seated.

00:13:00.059 --> 00:13:08.059
Jehovah's people are preaching the good news, Earthwide, and we rejoice to see many responding favorably.

00:13:08.059 --> 00:13:12.059
What can we learn from the efforts of our brothers around the world?

00:13:12.059 --> 00:13:16.059
How can we help honest hearted ones to make progress?

00:13:16.059 --> 00:13:22.059
The following video features experiences from six different regions.

00:13:22.059 --> 00:13:28.059
Brother Mark Numer, I help her to the teaching committee, will be our host.

00:13:28.059 --> 00:13:42.879
Let's now join Brother Numer and learn how our brothers are experiencing disciple making joy.

00:13:42.879 --> 00:13:50.879
If you were asked to think of two men in the first century who are zealous disciple makers, who would come to your mind,

00:13:50.879 --> 00:13:53.879
you may be thinking of Paul and Barnabas.

00:13:53.879 --> 00:14:01.879
Together, they traveled extensively preaching the good news and helping many to learn the wonderful truth about Jehovah.

00:14:01.879 --> 00:14:06.879
This work brought joy not only to them, but others too.

00:14:06.879 --> 00:14:13.879
Acts 15-3 states, So after being escorted part way by the congregation,

00:14:13.879 --> 00:14:22.879
these men continued on through both Phoenicia and Samaria relating in detail the conversion of people of the nations

00:14:22.879 --> 00:14:26.879
and bringing great joy to all the brothers.

00:14:26.879 --> 00:14:31.879
Their shared experiences were a great source of joy to the brotherhood.

00:14:31.879 --> 00:14:37.879
They all felt encouraged and united as one spiritual family.

00:14:37.879 --> 00:14:46.879
So too today, we have many like Paul and Barnabas, who are actively working to find honest hearted ones.

00:14:46.879 --> 00:14:55.879
Let's quickly review the numbers and see what our spiritual families United efforts have accomplished during the 2019 service here.

00:14:55.879 --> 00:14:59.879
The good news was preached in 240 lands.

00:14:59.879 --> 00:15:05.879
The average number of publishers each month reached over 8.4 million.

00:15:05.879 --> 00:15:09.879
More than 2 billion hours were spent in the field.

00:15:09.879 --> 00:15:20.879
Also, you'll be pleased to know that the number baptized surpassed 300,000 for the first time in 20 years.

00:15:20.879 --> 00:15:30.879
That's on average 5,843 people symbolizing their dedication to Jehovah every weekend.

00:15:30.879 --> 00:15:34.879
And there's great potential for millions more to embrace the truth.

00:15:34.879 --> 00:15:44.879
On average, 9.6 million Bible studies were conducted each month and almost 21 million attended the memorial.

00:15:44.879 --> 00:15:52.879
We praise Jehovah for this growth and thank you for your share in this great increase.

00:15:52.879 --> 00:15:58.879
The governing body receives some beautiful experiences and reports this past service here.

00:15:58.879 --> 00:16:02.879
And they wanted to share that joy with all of you now.

00:16:02.879 --> 00:16:08.879
Would you like to hear some of these reports and meet some of our hard working brothers and sisters?

00:16:08.879 --> 00:16:11.879
Well then, let's go.

00:16:11.879 --> 00:16:20.879
We'll meet publishers from six regions of the earth and hearing their own words, the effect that the disciple making work has on them.

00:16:20.879 --> 00:16:28.480
Here's a quick peek. We'll see some of their unique challenges.

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:36.480
When it rains, there is so much mud everywhere. We need to remove our shoes and hold them in our hands.

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:40.480
We'll meet ones who made personal sacrifices.

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:48.480
When I turned 60 and retired, my wife and I decided to serve where the need is greater.

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:54.480
This brother can see that he cannot walk. And me, I can walk but cannot see.

00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:59.789
We'll see the impact the truth can have on new ones.

00:16:59.789 --> 00:17:05.789
It may be happy yet, can I really dare believe that?

00:17:05.789 --> 00:17:12.789
I was actually sort of in shock and really put a spotlight on who I really was.

00:17:12.789 --> 00:17:23.609
What bad habits did some have at first? What pressures did they face? And how did they overcome that?

00:17:23.609 --> 00:17:31.430
One day she asked her to choose between family and Jehovah.

00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:35.430
Hopefully, that wets your appetite for what's to come.

00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:47.430
Now, as we take you around the world, enjoy the stories of your brothers and sisters and watch for clues to what contributed to their joy.

00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:50.430
Let's begin with Africa.

00:17:53.289 --> 00:18:02.289
Its stretches from the Mediterranean past the Golden Sahara through mountains and savannas to the Cape of Good Hope.

00:18:02.289 --> 00:18:11.700
This continent is known for the enormous diversity and richness of its wildlife, Africa's population.

00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:18.700
About 1.3 billion people is growing faster than any other part of the world.

00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:22.700
More than 1,500 languages are spoken here.

00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:30.299
The first Christian from Africa, the Ethiopian Unic, mentioned at Acts chapter 8,

00:18:30.299 --> 00:18:36.299
likely brought the good news back with him to Ethiopia when he returned home.

00:18:36.299 --> 00:18:44.299
Today, over 1.7 million publishers are making disciples throughout this vast continent.

00:18:44.299 --> 00:18:51.299
Let's visit our brothers and sisters in Africa's most populous country, Nigeria.

00:18:51.299 --> 00:19:00.299
More than 360,000 publishers are sharing the good news with Nigeria's over 200 million people.

00:19:00.299 --> 00:19:08.299
The territory is highly diverse, more than 500 languages and 250 ethnic groups.

00:19:08.299 --> 00:19:13.299
It's so encouraging to see the response to the good news.

00:19:13.299 --> 00:19:24.299
Some 870,000 Bible studies are being conducted and on average 273 are baptized each week.

00:19:24.299 --> 00:19:28.299
This is the Utankong congregation in Benwe State.

00:19:28.299 --> 00:19:39.640
Here, 51 publishers and 4 regular pioneers are having good results despite a challenging territory.

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:46.640
Pritching in the Utankong territory is enjoyable. It is just that it is accompanied by some problems.

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:54.640
One is that the territories are very far apart and two, the roads are not good.

00:19:54.640 --> 00:20:01.640
It takes us three hours to get to some territories. When it rains, there is so much mud everywhere.

00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:05.640
We need to remove our shoes and hold them in our hands.

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:12.640
Whether households as a churchgoer, Muslims or traditional healers, they listen.

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:18.640
Many even accept our invitation to attend the meetings despite the travel challenges.

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:27.640
So it makes us very happy to see that in spite of far territories, bedrooms, we see good results.

00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:35.750
I'm enjoying my life now, but when I lost my sight, I thought it was all over.

00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:43.750
As a carpenter, I wondered how I would be able to do my carpentry. The thought of it worried me so much.

00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:49.750
But as I began to learn about Jehovah from the Bible, I came to realize that there was hope.

00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:53.750
That negative thinking that my life was over disappeared from my mind.

00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:57.750
So I am very happy now. I am joyful.

00:20:57.750 --> 00:21:02.750
There is a brother named Joseph. This brother can see, but he cannot walk.

00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:09.750
And me, I can walk, but cannot see. Our hold is wheelchair and push while he directs it.

00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:13.750
This has helped us to meet many of our Bible students.

00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:20.750
Before now, we were few that went out in the field as pioneers, but now we are many.

00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:29.750
This shows that the example has helped other people, because when they see someone who cannot walk and someone who cannot see a pioneering,

00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:38.539
they conclude that they can pioneer too. This is the experience of one of my relatives.

00:21:38.539 --> 00:21:43.539
His name is Cletus. He was very kind to me.

00:21:43.539 --> 00:21:47.539
He would hold my hand and assist me to the meetings at the Kingdom Hall.

00:21:47.539 --> 00:21:51.539
When he got to the Kingdom Hall, he would leave for his church.

00:21:51.539 --> 00:21:57.539
But as he noticed how I preached and attended meetings, the joy I radiated,

00:21:57.539 --> 00:22:03.539
the way we treated other people and our knowledge of the Scriptures.

00:22:03.539 --> 00:22:09.539
He was impressed and began asking many questions.

00:22:09.539 --> 00:22:14.539
The answers he got were quite different from what he had learnt, what they told him in church.

00:22:14.539 --> 00:22:21.589
They continued telling him, get out of there and that he should not talk to me again.

00:22:21.589 --> 00:22:31.170
He studied the Bible, concluded his study and got baptized.

00:22:31.170 --> 00:22:35.170
Now he serves as a ministerial servant.

00:22:35.170 --> 00:22:40.170
Sometimes, they used to assign talks to both of us to handle as a symposium.

00:22:40.170 --> 00:22:46.170
And this made me see Cletus as a spiritual brother in the organization and the congregation.

00:22:46.170 --> 00:22:53.279
This gives me joy and makes me very happy.

00:22:53.279 --> 00:23:00.279
When people notice our activities, they usually praise Jehovah and encourage us to do more.

00:23:00.279 --> 00:23:07.279
Since they know that the work we do is not by our power, but it is Jehovah who empowers us.

00:23:07.279 --> 00:23:12.279
It is true that I am blind, but I can see Jehovah.

00:23:12.279 --> 00:23:17.279
I am helping other people see Jehovah's hand in our lives.

00:23:17.279 --> 00:23:24.230
Even people are disabled, can bring praise to Jehovah.

00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:30.230
I have nothing to do other than to be joyful and praise Jehovah for my life.

00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:35.900
We share your joy, Brother Igbo.

00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:42.900
Doesn't it touch our hearts to see Gabriel and Joseph helping each other in the pioneer work?

00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:48.900
Their example encourages others to ask what prevents me from pioneering.

00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:51.900
Perhaps we are moved to ask that question too.

00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:55.900
And did you notice what spurred Cletus to action?

00:23:55.900 --> 00:24:00.900
He observed the conduct of Gabriel and other witnesses in the congregation.

00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:02.900
What do we learn?

00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:09.900
That our Christian conduct often speaks louder than even the most eloquent words.

00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:15.900
Now we go to the largest continent in the world, Asia.

00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:24.900
Asia is home to three fifths of the world's people, including some 760,000 Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:29.900
The geography of Asia ranges from Tundra

00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:39.900
to coral reefs, from Earth's tallest peak Mount Everest to its lowest land surface, the Dead Sea.

00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:44.900
Asia's cultural diversity is greater than any other continent.

00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:51.900
The two most populated countries in the world, China and India, are here in Asia.

00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:56.720
Let's visit our brothers in India.

00:24:56.720 --> 00:25:06.720
With a growing population of about 1.3 billion people, India is on track to become the world's most populous country within a decade.

00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:10.720
Imagine the potential for growth in India.

00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:21.720
With 90% of the population having not yet received a witness, our 50,000 brothers and sisters have plenty of work to do.

00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:31.720
The good news is being preached in territory that includes mountain ranges, planes and plateaus, villages and some of the world's largest cities.

00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:37.029
Hyderabad is in South Central India.

00:25:37.029 --> 00:25:44.029
This is the Hyderabad RTC Cross Road congregation in the heart of the city.

00:25:44.029 --> 00:25:52.029
Here, 94 publishers including 17 regular pioneers are conducting 95 Bible studies.

00:25:52.029 --> 00:25:59.029
They were delighted to have 252 attend last year's memorial.

00:25:59.029 --> 00:26:02.029
Let's meet Sungla.

00:26:02.029 --> 00:26:10.029
His story actually begins in another part of India, where he learned the truth with the help of Alex and Annie Doss.

00:26:10.029 --> 00:26:18.819
My wife and I serve in the Pandabha sign language group.

00:26:18.819 --> 00:26:26.819
Currently, there are only three publishers, me, my wife and another brother who is deaf.

00:26:26.819 --> 00:26:33.349
We have contact with our own 100 deaf ones in our territory.

00:26:33.349 --> 00:26:37.349
Each week, 50 to 60 deaf ones attend the meetings.

00:26:37.349 --> 00:26:44.349
When they come, they bring their deaf friends with them. They also bring their relatives.

00:26:44.349 --> 00:26:56.400
We are so happy to see them come regularly for the meetings in spite of the opposition from their families, sometimes even severe opposition.

00:26:56.400 --> 00:27:06.059
They are progressing well spiritually. We are really happy to see their spiritual advancement.

00:27:06.059 --> 00:27:12.059
When I turned 60 and retired, my wife and I decided to serve where the need is greater.

00:27:12.059 --> 00:27:17.059
To our surprise, we were asked to support the sign language field.

00:27:17.059 --> 00:27:22.059
At that time, we did not have any experience in sign language.

00:27:22.059 --> 00:27:27.059
Then, our circuit overseer asked us if we were ready to move to where the need is greater.

00:27:27.059 --> 00:27:35.059
He asked if we would move to Latur, a city that was 521 miles from our home.

00:27:35.059 --> 00:27:41.059
Once we reached a city, we were overjoyed to see the interest of the deaf ones.

00:27:42.059 --> 00:27:46.470
So, we decided to stay there.

00:27:46.470 --> 00:27:52.470
Not long after we arrived there, we met a priest, whose name is Sangram.

00:27:52.470 --> 00:28:00.359
He was the leader of a deaf association, and he was short-tempered.

00:28:00.359 --> 00:28:06.359
Since we wanted to meet him often, we invited him to our home to discuss the daily text.

00:28:06.359 --> 00:28:11.359
He came regularly at 7 o'clock for daily text discussions.

00:28:12.359 --> 00:28:16.359
When we moved here, we did not know how to sign very well.

00:28:16.359 --> 00:28:19.359
Both my wife and I knew almost nothing.

00:28:19.359 --> 00:28:23.359
But after we met Sangram and started to teach him the Bible,

00:28:23.359 --> 00:28:27.359
we in turn started to learn sign language from him.

00:28:27.359 --> 00:28:32.359
We were very happy. We were really, very happy.

00:28:32.359 --> 00:28:36.359
As soon as we started studying the Bible with Sangram,

00:28:36.359 --> 00:28:40.359
he made changes in his life in line with the Bible principles.

00:28:40.359 --> 00:28:42.359
He changed his hairstyle.

00:28:42.359 --> 00:28:47.359
He left the deaf association in which he was the leader.

00:28:47.359 --> 00:28:50.359
And even his personality changed.

00:28:50.359 --> 00:28:54.359
He stopped responding angrily to those who provoked him.

00:28:54.359 --> 00:28:58.359
We are so happy about the Bible discussions we had with him,

00:28:58.359 --> 00:29:02.359
because with this, his life changed completely.

00:29:02.359 --> 00:29:06.359
Soon, he broke almost all of his bad habits.

00:29:07.359 --> 00:29:12.359
However, he was still unable to stop his habit of chewing tobacco.

00:29:12.359 --> 00:29:18.359
Now, since we loved him, we took him to a dentist and had his teeth cleaned.

00:29:18.359 --> 00:29:24.359
After that visit to the dentist, he completely stopped using tobacco.

00:29:24.359 --> 00:29:28.359
Within six months from starting the Bible study,

00:29:28.359 --> 00:29:31.359
Sangram became a qualified publisher.

00:29:31.359 --> 00:29:35.359
And after that, he continued to progress well.

00:29:35.359 --> 00:29:41.119
Later, now has the sign language congregation.

00:29:41.119 --> 00:29:44.119
My wife and I then moved to another group.

00:29:44.119 --> 00:29:47.119
We are now serving in Pandapur.

00:29:47.119 --> 00:29:52.119
When we meet our old studies in the conventions and see their progress,

00:29:52.119 --> 00:29:55.119
we are overjoyed.

00:29:55.119 --> 00:30:00.119
The very thought that Jehovah's extended us this privilege to serve him

00:30:00.119 --> 00:30:03.119
makes us overwhelmed with happiness.

00:30:03.119 --> 00:30:06.119
There are no words to express how we feel.

00:30:06.119 --> 00:30:15.329
When Sangram showed us his big smile,

00:30:15.329 --> 00:30:18.329
that a smile come to your face too,

00:30:18.329 --> 00:30:21.329
that's how the truth affects us.

00:30:21.329 --> 00:30:25.329
And don't we appreciate the sacrifices that Alex and Annie made

00:30:25.329 --> 00:30:28.329
in order to serve where the need was greater?

00:30:28.329 --> 00:30:33.329
They had to learn sign language and move far away from their home.

00:30:33.329 --> 00:30:35.329
But how did it turn out?

00:30:35.329 --> 00:30:39.329
Alex says, they are overwhelmed with happiness.

00:30:39.329 --> 00:30:47.150
Imagine that. They were certainly rewarded for their sacrificing spirit.

00:30:47.150 --> 00:30:50.150
We now move west to Europe.

00:30:50.150 --> 00:30:54.150
Europe gave birth to the Greek and Roman empires,

00:30:54.150 --> 00:30:57.150
the Middle Ages and the Renaissance.

00:30:57.150 --> 00:31:01.150
With 160 culturally distinct groups,

00:31:01.150 --> 00:31:05.150
Europe is immensely varied and densely populated.

00:31:05.150 --> 00:31:09.150
Almost 1.6 million Jehovah's Witnesses

00:31:09.150 --> 00:31:14.150
are actively making disciples on this continent.

00:31:14.150 --> 00:31:19.150
In southeastern Europe, you'll find Romania,

00:31:19.150 --> 00:31:23.150
a country of nearly 20 million people.

00:31:23.150 --> 00:31:31.150
Today, over 39,000 publishers are conducting almost 22,000 Bible studies.

00:31:31.150 --> 00:31:36.150
8 out of 10 people belong to the Romanian Orthodox Church,

00:31:36.150 --> 00:31:40.150
the ratio of publishers to the population varies greatly.

00:31:40.150 --> 00:31:49.589
From 1 to 4,000 in the southeast to 1 to 7 in Transylvania in the northwest.

00:31:49.589 --> 00:31:56.589
Last year, special preaching campaigns were organized to reach those in unassigned territories.

00:31:56.589 --> 00:32:04.380
As a result, 85% of these territories have been given a witness.

00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:12.380
Here are the 112 publishers and four regular pioneers of the Gibo Centro Congregation.

00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:16.380
They serve a territory that includes a small city,

00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:21.380
rural areas and large communities of Hungarians and Roma.

00:32:21.380 --> 00:32:27.380
Let's see what it's like to make disciples there.

00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:32.380
One of the challenges we face in our town is that we have a small territory

00:32:32.380 --> 00:32:39.380
compared to the number of brothers, a ratio of one publisher to about 40 inhabitants.

00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:43.380
So we put great emphasis on preaching in the villages around Gibo.

00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:51.859
Jehovah blessed our efforts and we have more Bible studies which make good progress.

00:32:51.859 --> 00:32:56.859
When I was still in elementary school, not yet baptized myself,

00:32:56.859 --> 00:33:00.859
I used to speak about Jehovah to one of my classmates.

00:33:00.859 --> 00:33:02.859
Her name was Oana.

00:33:02.859 --> 00:33:06.859
She was very interested and even asked many questions.

00:33:06.859 --> 00:33:09.859
We were both 12 at that time.

00:33:09.859 --> 00:33:20.369
A little while later, after I got baptized, Oana became my first Bible student.

00:33:20.369 --> 00:33:24.369
I was able to show her how to prepare well for the study.

00:33:24.369 --> 00:33:27.369
In the evening, we used to read the Bible together

00:33:27.369 --> 00:33:32.369
and we even wrote down in a notebook our favourite Bible texts.

00:33:32.369 --> 00:33:36.369
At the same time, by means of different study projects,

00:33:36.369 --> 00:33:39.369
I tried to help us see Jehovah as a real person.

00:33:39.369 --> 00:33:43.369
For example, we wrote down on a big sheet of paper

00:33:43.369 --> 00:33:47.369
all of Jehovah's qualities and the way we could imitate them.

00:33:47.369 --> 00:33:57.109
Oana made good progress, attended the meetings and even started to participate.

00:33:57.109 --> 00:34:02.109
I was so happy to see how much joy Oana had in learning about the truth.

00:34:02.109 --> 00:34:07.940
Not surprisingly, difficulties arose on the way.

00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:12.940
Oana's mother was not happy at all that I was studying with her daughter.

00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:22.849
She forbade her to study and one day she asked her to choose between family and Jehovah

00:34:22.849 --> 00:34:24.849
and put her out of the house.

00:34:24.849 --> 00:34:26.849
Oana was 16 years old.

00:34:26.849 --> 00:34:35.570
I encouraged Oana with the scripture from Isaiah 41, verses 10 and 13,

00:34:36.570 --> 00:34:42.570
which says that Jehovah is grasping our hand and that he will help us.

00:34:42.570 --> 00:34:46.570
We talked a lot together and we prayed together.

00:34:46.570 --> 00:34:50.570
And after only one week, Jehovah answered our prayers.

00:34:50.570 --> 00:34:55.570
Oana's mother calmed down and not only allowed her to return home

00:34:55.570 --> 00:34:59.570
but also to attend meetings and to continue studying together.

00:34:59.570 --> 00:35:02.570
I was so happy.

00:35:02.570 --> 00:35:09.070
On 21st of July 2018, Oana got baptized.

00:35:09.070 --> 00:35:15.070
Now I can finally preach together with my spiritual sister.

00:35:15.070 --> 00:35:18.070
Jehovah always gave me the joy I needed.

00:35:18.070 --> 00:35:29.159
In fact, I can't find the words to describe the joy I experienced now.

00:35:29.159 --> 00:35:34.159
Did you notice where and when Beatrice started talking to Oana about Jehovah?

00:35:34.159 --> 00:35:41.159
In elementary school, what a wonderful reminder that you young ones can experience joy

00:35:41.159 --> 00:35:45.159
by making school your personal territory.

00:35:45.159 --> 00:35:50.159
If you haven't tried it already, look for someone with whom you can share the good news.

00:35:50.159 --> 00:35:54.159
You may be surprised at the results.

00:35:54.159 --> 00:35:58.159
Let's go next to North America.

00:35:58.159 --> 00:36:02.159
Now this continent extends from tiny islands near the Arctic

00:36:02.159 --> 00:36:06.159
to the isthmus of Panama in the south.

00:36:06.159 --> 00:36:12.159
North America is home to almost 2.6 million Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:36:12.159 --> 00:36:17.159
The United States is by far the most populous country in North America

00:36:17.159 --> 00:36:21.159
with over 325 million people.

00:36:21.159 --> 00:36:29.539
Here you can find metropolitan cities as well as vast areas that are sparsely populated.

00:36:29.539 --> 00:36:38.539
This territory is cared for by more than 1.2 million publishers and over 180,000 pioneers.

00:36:38.539 --> 00:36:44.539
Meet the brothers and sisters of the Juniata River, Pennsylvania German congregation

00:36:44.539 --> 00:36:47.539
in Mifflin town, Pennsylvania.

00:36:48.539 --> 00:36:53.539
As we'll see in the following report, their unique territory is rich with people

00:36:53.539 --> 00:37:08.260
who sincerely respect God's word.

00:37:08.260 --> 00:37:11.260
The challenges are territory being so vast.

00:37:11.260 --> 00:37:17.260
Sometimes you may drive an hour and a half, two hours just to get to the territory.

00:37:17.260 --> 00:37:22.260
One of my favorite joys is getting to use the Bible constantly in this field.

00:37:22.260 --> 00:37:26.260
They respect the Bible. They all have one in their house.

00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:31.260
Starting this language almost three years ago from a pregroup to now a congregation

00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:36.260
with four groups in the area, you can see the growth and the excitement of everyone.

00:37:36.260 --> 00:37:51.500
Honestly, I can say it's been the happiest time of my life since I started working in this field.

00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:54.500
Out in service one day, just working door to door, I met a lady

00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:57.500
and she accepted the greatest man book.

00:37:57.500 --> 00:38:02.500
Eventually, Memorial season came around. I went and left an invitation with Jane.

00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:07.500
We went back the day before the Memorial and were surprised when Jane said,

00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:09.500
yes, we'd love to come.

00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:15.500
So we talked about a Bible study and eventually Jerry agreed to having one as a family.

00:38:15.500 --> 00:38:20.869
But there was a contrast from what I'd been taught.

00:38:20.869 --> 00:38:28.869
So I was willing to dig for more knowledge to try and figure out what was going on here.

00:38:28.869 --> 00:38:33.869
He read scripture Psalms about the earth and I said,

00:38:33.869 --> 00:38:40.869
wow, yes, all the things I've pictured myself doing in heaven is the things I enjoy on earth.

00:38:40.869 --> 00:38:47.699
And maybe happy yet, can I really dare believe that?

00:38:47.699 --> 00:38:53.699
The more I studied about the Bible, looked up to scriptures, the more I realized

00:38:53.699 --> 00:38:56.699
I never really knew a whole lot about the Bible.

00:38:57.699 --> 00:39:02.699
I was actually sort of in shock and really put a spotlight on who I really was.

00:39:02.699 --> 00:39:08.679
At one point, Ben and I went over to make a return visit.

00:39:08.679 --> 00:39:15.679
We had planned what we wanted to do with the family and it just did not lend to that at all.

00:39:15.679 --> 00:39:18.679
And we ended up playing cards instead.

00:39:18.679 --> 00:39:21.679
We didn't get to share anything from the Bible.

00:39:21.679 --> 00:39:27.989
The family was like, oh, it dawned on them. We're real people too.

00:39:27.989 --> 00:39:34.989
In the Pennsylvania German culture, people teach pretty strongly obedience to parents to make God happy.

00:39:34.989 --> 00:39:37.989
One day, Jerry lets me know that his dad wants to talk to me.

00:39:37.989 --> 00:39:42.989
Although my dad meant it well, he tried to stop the study.

00:39:42.989 --> 00:39:49.989
But the information that he was bringing to me about the witnesses is not what I saw.

00:39:49.989 --> 00:39:54.989
What we were being taught was directly from my Bible I had in my house.

00:39:54.989 --> 00:39:57.989
How could it be wrong?

00:39:57.989 --> 00:40:01.989
You could tell they were just distraught as a family of what was going on.

00:40:01.989 --> 00:40:05.989
They wanted to do the right thing but they could feel all the pressure to stop.

00:40:05.989 --> 00:40:14.619
We eventually had to cut ties in order to continue spiritual growth.

00:40:14.619 --> 00:40:19.789
After that, Jerry and Jane just progressed very fast.

00:40:19.789 --> 00:40:26.789
They were making changes in their life and they got to really see the freedom that serving Jehovah gives you.

00:40:26.789 --> 00:40:32.789
Seeing their joy grow was irreplaceable. It was fantastic.

00:40:32.789 --> 00:40:43.519
We have gained a hundredfold what we could have ever lost.

00:40:43.519 --> 00:40:51.519
And so as we share good news with individuals and as they make progress, we are very excited and happy.

00:40:51.519 --> 00:40:56.519
I would love just everyone to have that opportunity to have that same joy.

00:40:56.519 --> 00:41:05.309
What happened when Jerry and Jane read for themselves the truths contained in the Bible?

00:41:05.309 --> 00:41:12.309
It deeply affected their thoughts and emotions and revealed who they really were on the inside.

00:41:12.309 --> 00:41:18.309
As a result, they now joyfully served Jehovah along with their children.

00:41:18.309 --> 00:41:22.309
Ben and Joanna used the Bible skillfully.

00:41:22.309 --> 00:41:25.309
They let God's Word speak for itself.

00:41:25.309 --> 00:41:33.309
And the joy this experience brought them is, as Ben said, irreplaceable, fantastic.

00:41:33.309 --> 00:41:39.309
That kind of joy is contagious. We feel it too just watching them.

00:41:39.309 --> 00:41:42.309
Next we go to Oceania.

00:41:42.309 --> 00:41:50.309
This is the collective name for Australia and for the more than 10,000 islands in the Pacific Ocean

00:41:50.309 --> 00:41:54.309
between Asia and the Americas.

00:41:54.309 --> 00:42:05.309
Some of Oceania's islands are known as high islands because they were developed as volcanic eruptions built up land over time.

00:42:05.309 --> 00:42:14.309
Low islands, such as the country of Kiribats, are made of coral and sometimes barely reach above sea level.

00:42:14.309 --> 00:42:22.820
Over 100,000 Jehovah's Witnesses are hard at work in this beautiful territory.

00:42:22.820 --> 00:42:33.820
Fiji is an archipelago of some 300 islands scattered over 3 million square kilometers or about 1 million square miles.

00:42:33.820 --> 00:42:41.820
This territory is cared for by some 3,000 publishers and over 500 pioneers.

00:42:41.820 --> 00:42:49.820
In the last service here, they conducted over 4,700 Bible studies.

00:42:49.820 --> 00:42:54.820
These brothers and sisters are in the South-Suva English congregation.

00:42:54.820 --> 00:43:00.739
Let's see what unique challenges our brothers face there.

00:43:00.739 --> 00:43:05.739
Many, if not all, in our territory, know about God's Word, the Bible.

00:43:05.739 --> 00:43:08.739
However, they are taught false teachings.

00:43:08.739 --> 00:43:15.739
The challenge arises when customs and traditions conflict with Bible teachings.

00:43:15.739 --> 00:43:23.739
As they study and they progress, they face opposition from their family and of course there's the social pressure that comes from their community.

00:43:23.739 --> 00:43:27.739
Added to this is the materialistic goals that are put before them.

00:43:27.739 --> 00:43:32.739
So all of this combined really poses a challenge with these ones progressing.

00:43:32.739 --> 00:43:37.739
Despite these challenges, some of them eventually do study the Bible with us.

00:43:38.739 --> 00:43:42.739
Some have become Jehovah's friends and made the truth their own.

00:43:42.739 --> 00:43:48.739
So to be able to show these ones from God's Word, the Bible, that Jehovah is a God of love.

00:43:48.739 --> 00:43:52.739
And to see their reaction, that in itself is a wonderful blessing.

00:43:52.739 --> 00:43:57.619
I used to study with this young girl.

00:43:57.619 --> 00:43:59.619
She wanted to make progress in the truth.

00:43:59.619 --> 00:44:05.619
But in order for her to do that, she had to overcome these two biggest obstacles.

00:44:05.619 --> 00:44:14.619
One was this career that she had and the other was the obstacle from her unbelieving family.

00:44:14.619 --> 00:44:18.619
I really don't want to impose the truth on her.

00:44:18.619 --> 00:44:26.619
So my goal was to help her understand what the Bible teaches, help her see the big picture and let her draw her own conclusion.

00:44:26.619 --> 00:44:34.829
I try and be a good example to her by enjoying the ministry myself.

00:44:35.829 --> 00:44:39.829
And helping her to understand that is I'm out in the ministry.

00:44:39.829 --> 00:44:41.829
I know I'm working along with Jehovah.

00:44:41.829 --> 00:44:47.829
Although she had a high paying job, she wasn't happy.

00:44:47.829 --> 00:44:50.829
She was always stressed.

00:44:50.829 --> 00:44:55.829
When she sees Jehovah's Witnesses, despite being out there in the ministry,

00:44:55.829 --> 00:44:59.829
hot sunny day, rainy day, they're happy.

00:45:00.829 --> 00:45:07.829
She knew and was convinced that she would be really happy if she put Jehovah first in her life.

00:45:07.829 --> 00:45:13.829
So eventually she had to tell her mother-in-law that she had resigned from her employment.

00:45:13.829 --> 00:45:17.829
So her mother-in-law says, and now you resigned?

00:45:17.829 --> 00:45:20.829
So what you're going to do, you're going to go preaching?

00:45:20.829 --> 00:45:25.829
And then she says, the decision that I've made is going to make me happy.

00:45:25.829 --> 00:45:28.829
It's going to make Jehovah happy as well.

00:45:29.829 --> 00:45:38.829
In seeing the big picture, she was able to make a stand for true worship and be on Jehovah's side of universal sovereignty.

00:45:38.829 --> 00:45:42.829
I attended the Pioneer Service School with her.

00:45:42.829 --> 00:45:45.829
You know what really made me happy?

00:45:45.829 --> 00:45:53.829
Is seeing ones like her, being happy, and doing the same work in helping others come to serve Jehovah.

00:45:53.829 --> 00:46:02.829
And knowing the fact that Jehovah had actually used me in helping others find the truth and serve Jehovah as well.

00:46:02.829 --> 00:46:11.780
To some, Fiji may seem like paradise.

00:46:11.780 --> 00:46:18.780
But as we learned, the people of that beautiful land face the same issues as people everywhere.

00:46:18.780 --> 00:46:23.780
Stress, pressure filled jobs, and an uncertain future.

00:46:23.780 --> 00:46:33.780
As Makareta's student learned, putting Jehovah first is the only guarantee for true lasting happiness.

00:46:33.780 --> 00:46:38.780
Our final destination is South America.

00:46:38.780 --> 00:46:47.780
South America is home to Earth's largest river, the Amazon, as well as the driest place, the Atacama Desert.

00:46:47.780 --> 00:46:51.780
Animal life on this continent is rich and diverse.

00:46:51.780 --> 00:46:54.780
Particularly its bird population.

00:46:54.780 --> 00:47:02.780
With some 3,000 species of birds, South America is sometimes called the bird continent.

00:47:02.780 --> 00:47:11.780
More than 400 million people live here, including over 1.7 million Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:47:11.780 --> 00:47:17.769
There's tremendous language diversity in South America.

00:47:17.769 --> 00:47:29.590
Let's visit Bolivia, a country of more than 11 million people, and a wide range of indigenous cultures.

00:47:29.590 --> 00:47:37.590
Bolivia presents unique challenges to our about 28,000 brothers and sisters who live here.

00:47:37.590 --> 00:47:45.590
Their territory includes the towering and east mountains in the west, and rainforests in the north.

00:47:45.590 --> 00:47:53.590
The publishers endure weather that ranges from burning heat and tropical humidity to freezing winds.

00:47:53.590 --> 00:48:02.590
To reach remote territories, they may have to cross rivers and drive for hours on poorly maintained mountain roads.

00:48:02.590 --> 00:48:07.590
Sometimes just a few millimeters or inches from the precipice.

00:48:07.590 --> 00:48:12.590
But how Jehovah's blessing their courageous efforts.

00:48:12.590 --> 00:48:19.590
In the last service year alone, more than 42,000 Bible studies were conducted.

00:48:19.590 --> 00:48:27.590
Here are the 35 publishers and eight regular pioneers of the Norte Quechua congregation.

00:48:27.590 --> 00:48:34.590
To reach and seek out those who speak Quechua, the publishers travel long distances.

00:48:34.590 --> 00:48:44.590
Sadly, many of the Quechua-speaking community have been victims of prejudice and do not receive basic education in their language.

00:48:44.590 --> 00:48:53.590
Our brothers and sisters spend hours helping interested ones learn to read so they can comprehend basic Bible truths.

00:48:53.590 --> 00:48:58.590
Their response to the good news in Bolivia is very positive.

00:48:58.590 --> 00:49:08.590
But as we'll learn in the following report, Bible students frequently face opposition, often from those closest to them.

00:49:08.590 --> 00:49:19.590
When an interested person begins to learn the truth from the Bible, at first the family is happy for them, and their friends are happy too.

00:49:20.590 --> 00:49:30.590
But when the teachings of the Bible are in opposition to popular customs, those family members and friends may become their main source of opposition.

00:49:30.590 --> 00:49:35.590
However, we have also seen many, many blessings from Jehovah.

00:49:35.590 --> 00:49:45.590
For example, although the challenge is maybe great, we see Jehovah's hand working in the lives of each of these individuals because they make huge changes.

00:49:45.590 --> 00:49:53.590
They take hold of Jehovah, they see him as their God, and they leave behind popular customs and start to make progress.

00:49:53.590 --> 00:49:58.590
It is a beautiful blessing to see a Bible suit and get baptized filled with joy.

00:49:58.590 --> 00:50:06.159
Lydia was a young woman who was very interested in spiritual things.

00:50:06.159 --> 00:50:15.159
But, just like anyone that does not study the Bible, she had habits that were not pleasing to Jehovah.

00:50:15.159 --> 00:50:23.159
She liked to socialize with her workmates, and at times she went out drinking with her friends.

00:50:23.159 --> 00:50:27.159
Sometimes drinking a little too much.

00:50:27.159 --> 00:50:39.159
However, despite that, she was very humble. You could see that she was very sincere. She appreciated good things.

00:50:39.159 --> 00:50:49.159
After seeing these beautiful qualities in her, I said, Jehovah can make other good qualities growing her heart.

00:50:49.159 --> 00:50:53.159
So we set the date to start the study.

00:50:53.159 --> 00:50:59.159
We always try to be consistent and to not miss a study.

00:50:59.159 --> 00:51:09.159
When a publisher does not miss the day and time for the study, the devil is not given the opportunity to disrupt it.

00:51:09.159 --> 00:51:18.159
Some teachings Lydia accepted immediately, but others took more time.

00:51:18.159 --> 00:51:26.159
Her manner of dress was not appropriate. She wore tight clothing and very short skirts.

00:51:26.159 --> 00:51:35.159
How did we correct that? By showing her in the Bible that women should dress with modesty and soundness of mind.

00:51:35.159 --> 00:51:38.159
It was not easy, but she did it.

00:51:38.159 --> 00:51:44.159
After that, when she attended meetings, she looked like one of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:51:44.159 --> 00:51:51.159
When you plant a literal plant, you start to water it and it keeps growing.

00:51:51.159 --> 00:51:55.159
While you're sleeping, you don't know how those changes happen.

00:51:55.159 --> 00:52:00.159
It happens exactly the same way with a Bible student.

00:52:00.159 --> 00:52:06.599
As time passed, Lydia expressed the desire to be baptized.

00:52:06.599 --> 00:52:12.599
After that, she just kept making progress and started to serve as a regular pioneer.

00:52:12.599 --> 00:52:16.599
Later, she was invited to serve in Bethel.

00:52:16.599 --> 00:52:20.599
She has been serving in Bethel for 16 years.

00:52:20.599 --> 00:52:29.030
I am one of the 70 persons that lend the truth from Edith.

00:52:29.030 --> 00:52:41.030
Her example helped me to be considerate, insightful, and also to be consistent in making disciples.

00:52:41.030 --> 00:52:52.400
Over the years, I have learned so much about disciples making, especially that this work is not ours.

00:52:52.400 --> 00:53:04.130
When Bible students make progress, it is thanks to the blessing of Jehovah because he sees their hearts.

00:53:04.130 --> 00:53:07.130
So we're not working for a man.

00:53:07.130 --> 00:53:11.130
We're working for the most high God.

00:53:11.130 --> 00:53:22.139
How encouraging to see ones like Lydia learn the truth and with God's help make the needed changes.

00:53:23.139 --> 00:53:29.139
And what joy it continues to bring to her teacher, Edith, to see her serving Jehovah today.

00:53:29.139 --> 00:53:40.139
As Edith says, when Bible students make progress, it is thanks to the blessing of Jehovah because he sees their heart.

00:53:40.139 --> 00:53:47.139
Well, in our time together, we've circled the earth to bring you these experiences.

00:53:48.139 --> 00:53:52.139
Did you notice any patterns for joyful disciple making?

00:53:52.139 --> 00:53:56.139
Here are just four patterns that stood out to me.

00:53:56.139 --> 00:54:04.460
We saw that the first step is to seek out all those with the right heart condition.

00:54:04.460 --> 00:54:18.119
Our brothers in Nigeria, Fiji and Bolivia spread the good news despite the great distances, poor roads, and extreme weather.

00:54:18.119 --> 00:54:28.400
And when the Bible and Joseph teamed up to overcome their disabilities and their example inspires us to do more.

00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:37.400
Alex and Annie Doss learned sign language and moved more than 500 miles to serve where the need was greater.

00:54:37.400 --> 00:54:45.400
Then we saw a second vital element in disciple making, the art of teaching.

00:54:45.400 --> 00:54:51.400
We know, for example, that helping students to reason on the scriptures is very effective.

00:54:51.400 --> 00:54:55.400
That was the case with Makareta.

00:54:55.400 --> 00:55:01.400
Using the scriptures, she helped her student draw her own conclusions about the truth.

00:55:01.400 --> 00:55:08.679
Benjamin and Joanna skillfully use the Bible with Jerry and Jane.

00:55:08.679 --> 00:55:13.679
The power of the scriptures touched their hearts.

00:55:13.679 --> 00:55:25.380
And when opposition came, they stood firm because they were convinced that they were learning the truth from God's inspired word.

00:55:25.380 --> 00:55:35.380
A third element of disciple making involves helping our students to develop good study habits and a regular spiritual routine.

00:55:35.380 --> 00:55:39.380
Edith and Lydia made it a goal never to miss a study.

00:55:39.380 --> 00:55:51.010
Beatrice showed creativity developing projects like that big sheet of paper to help want to know Jehovah as a real person.

00:55:51.010 --> 00:56:01.010
And fourth, in every experience, we saw that disciple making involves love, showing genuine love.

00:56:01.010 --> 00:56:08.480
Alex and Annie took some room to the dentist because they love him.

00:56:08.480 --> 00:56:12.480
What motivated clearest to study the Bible?

00:56:12.480 --> 00:56:19.789
The joy radiated by Jehovah's people and the loving way we treat others.

00:56:19.789 --> 00:56:25.789
Angeline gave up her stressful job and put Jehovah first. Why?

00:56:25.789 --> 00:56:36.789
Because she observed Jehovah's witnesses who out of self-sacrificing love were motivated to preach the good news on hot days and rainy days.

00:56:36.789 --> 00:56:42.099
And she especially noted the joy it brought them.

00:56:42.099 --> 00:56:52.099
As you can see, the joy of Jehovah comes from sincere efforts to help people and Jehovah's blessing on those efforts.

00:56:52.099 --> 00:56:59.099
When you see and hear your brothers and sisters heartfelt expressions, how does it make you feel?

00:56:59.099 --> 00:57:05.099
Like Paul and Barnabas, we too may have challenges along the way, even some setbacks.

00:57:05.099 --> 00:57:15.099
But nothing compares with the deep joy and happiness that results from helping others come to know and love Jehovah.

00:57:15.099 --> 00:57:21.099
There are still honest hearted ones out there and they desperately need the truth.

00:57:21.099 --> 00:57:30.099
It's experiences like the ones we've just listened to that help us to see that Jehovah is truly speeding up the work.

00:57:30.099 --> 00:57:40.099
The next time you go out in service, picture yourself working side by side with your brothers and sisters around the world.

00:57:40.099 --> 00:57:50.099
Just as in a search and rescue effort, we may feel we're not finding survivors in our area, but just one report.

00:57:50.099 --> 00:57:58.099
Of a rescue victim being pulled out alive, spurs on all the volunteers to double their efforts.

00:57:58.099 --> 00:58:13.099
Imagine the joy Jehovah feels when he looks down and sees us across the globe, working shoulder to shoulder in the greatest rescue mission of all time.

00:58:13.099 --> 00:58:22.099
So keep calling out. Keep searching through the rubble of this dying system to find those crying out for help.

00:58:22.099 --> 00:58:26.099
And may your joy abound as you do so.

00:58:26.099 --> 00:58:35.630
How exciting to see the ways that our brothers and sisters are helping people to respond to the good news.

00:58:35.630 --> 00:58:44.139
How can we assist those with whom we study the Bible to progress to dedication and baptism?

00:58:44.139 --> 00:58:51.139
The following symposium discusses five areas in which our Bible students need our help.

00:58:51.139 --> 00:58:55.139
Each speaker will introduce the one to follow.

00:58:55.139 --> 00:59:00.139
Brother Mark Sanderson of the governing body will present the first talk entitled,

00:59:00.139 --> 00:59:05.139
Help your Bible students to feed themselves spiritually.

00:59:05.139 --> 00:59:18.019
Before our Lord Jesus returned to heaven, He gave what has been called the Great Commission.

00:59:18.019 --> 00:59:30.019
He said, Go there for and make disciples of people of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.

00:59:30.019 --> 00:59:35.019
No doubt you have those words in your mind as well.

00:59:35.019 --> 00:59:41.019
Jesus was not satisfied that people should just come to know His teachings.

00:59:41.019 --> 00:59:49.019
Jesus wanted people to come to love His teachings so that they would act on them, so that they would live by them,

00:59:49.019 --> 00:59:54.019
and so that they would become His true disciples.

00:59:54.019 --> 01:00:00.019
Now, why did Jesus want people to become His disciples and live by His teachings?

01:00:00.019 --> 01:00:07.019
Well, it's because of something that we read here in John chapter 13 and verse 17.

01:00:08.019 --> 01:00:11.019
Now, notice what Jesus said here.

01:00:11.019 --> 01:00:17.019
If you know these things, happy you are if you do them.

01:00:17.019 --> 01:00:19.019
What's the point?

01:00:19.019 --> 01:00:23.019
Jesus was saying that people would find real happiness.

01:00:23.019 --> 01:00:26.019
They would find the way of salvation.

01:00:26.019 --> 01:00:30.019
They would have a relationship with His precious Heavenly Father,

01:00:30.019 --> 01:00:36.019
if they would just come to know and do the things that He had taught.

01:00:36.019 --> 01:00:42.019
Brothers and sisters, in this symposium, we are going to discuss five different things

01:00:42.019 --> 01:00:46.019
that our Bible students need to do, that they need to progress in,

01:00:46.019 --> 01:00:51.019
if they are going to become true disciples of our Lord Jesus Christ.

01:00:51.019 --> 01:00:54.019
Let's talk about the first.

01:00:54.019 --> 01:00:59.019
What is the most basic need that our Bible students have?

01:00:59.019 --> 01:01:03.019
Well, it's what Jesus talked about here in Matthew chapter 5.

01:01:03.019 --> 01:01:06.019
Let's read it together.

01:01:06.019 --> 01:01:10.019
Matthew chapter 5 and verse 3.

01:01:10.019 --> 01:01:15.019
Jesus said, happy are those conscious of their notice?

01:01:15.019 --> 01:01:21.019
Spiritual need since the kingdom of the heavens belongs to them.

01:01:21.019 --> 01:01:23.019
What's the point?

01:01:23.019 --> 01:01:28.019
Well, Jesus showed that honest-hearted people have a spiritual need.

01:01:29.019 --> 01:01:33.019
They have a need to come to know God and to have a relationship with Him

01:01:33.019 --> 01:01:36.019
if they are really going to be happy.

01:01:36.019 --> 01:01:42.019
Therefore, we need to teach our Bible students the very first thing

01:01:42.019 --> 01:01:50.019
to see how they can fill that spiritual need by learning about their Heavenly Father, Jehovah.

01:01:50.019 --> 01:01:54.019
As they fill that need, as they come to have that relationship with God,

01:01:54.019 --> 01:01:58.019
that is the way to true happiness.

01:01:58.019 --> 01:02:03.019
That means more than just feeding people information.

01:02:03.019 --> 01:02:06.019
You know, there's a saying that's very familiar to most of us.

01:02:06.019 --> 01:02:10.019
It says, give a man a fish, feed him for a day.

01:02:10.019 --> 01:02:14.019
Teach him how to fish, feed him for a lifetime.

01:02:14.019 --> 01:02:16.019
What's the point?

01:02:16.019 --> 01:02:21.019
If we can teach our Bible students how to feed themselves spiritually,

01:02:21.019 --> 01:02:26.019
then they have the way in front of them to a close relationship with God

01:02:26.019 --> 01:02:32.019
to strong faith and becoming real disciples of Jesus Christ.

01:02:32.019 --> 01:02:36.019
Well, now in the following demonstration that you'll see on video,

01:02:36.019 --> 01:02:42.019
just notice how our Bible teacher helps her student to be able to do this.

01:02:42.019 --> 01:03:01.900
Got it.

01:03:01.900 --> 01:03:06.179
I find the answers in all that.

01:03:06.179 --> 01:03:09.179
It's more than just the answers.

01:03:09.179 --> 01:03:14.099
And with it, I'm all about study.

01:03:14.099 --> 01:03:17.099
Which do you remember more from our studies?

01:03:17.099 --> 01:03:19.099
The answers?

01:03:19.099 --> 01:03:21.099
Or the things that touch your heart?

01:03:21.099 --> 01:03:25.300
Yeah.

01:03:25.300 --> 01:03:31.300
Like, when we talked about immorality, you knew the answer.

01:03:31.300 --> 01:03:40.219
But you didn't seem totally convinced in here.

01:03:40.219 --> 01:03:44.719
Let's try and find that answer.

01:03:50.519 --> 01:03:57.519
But who ever practices sexual immorality is sinning against his own body?

01:03:57.519 --> 01:04:06.050
Not sure why.

01:04:06.050 --> 01:04:08.050
It made me think of Mum and Dad.

01:04:08.050 --> 01:04:11.050
His constant cheating, actually.

01:04:11.050 --> 01:04:16.050
Mum's humiliation, the divorce, or the misery.

01:04:16.050 --> 01:04:25.469
I didn't want that.

01:04:25.469 --> 01:04:30.469
I began to realise how right Jehovah is.

01:04:30.469 --> 01:04:33.469
Because of what need to call meditation.

01:04:33.469 --> 01:04:37.469
It's not about clearing your mind to find inner peace.

01:04:37.469 --> 01:04:40.469
It's totally different.

01:04:40.469 --> 01:04:45.469
It's asking how Jehovah feels about something.

01:04:45.469 --> 01:04:56.119
And then what that means for me.

01:04:56.119 --> 01:04:58.119
Now, what did you notice in the video?

01:04:58.119 --> 01:05:02.119
It's true, Nita showed her Bible student the tools.

01:05:02.119 --> 01:05:05.119
But what more did she do?

01:05:05.119 --> 01:05:10.119
She also helped her to see that the answers were not the most important thing.

01:05:10.119 --> 01:05:15.119
The most important thing was having the information come to touch her heart

01:05:15.119 --> 01:05:19.119
so that she would be moved to act on what she learned.

01:05:19.119 --> 01:05:25.119
Well, how can we help our students to be able to feed themselves spiritually?

01:05:25.119 --> 01:05:29.119
Well, from the very beginning, once the study has been established,

01:05:29.119 --> 01:05:34.119
we want to teach our students how to prepare each week for the study.

01:05:34.119 --> 01:05:37.119
Now, this might be something very new to them.

01:05:37.119 --> 01:05:41.119
So we're going to have to go through it step by step, showing them how to prepare.

01:05:41.119 --> 01:05:47.119
It might also involve having to help them see how they can buy out time from their schedule

01:05:47.119 --> 01:05:51.119
so that they can do what's necessary to prepare.

01:05:51.119 --> 01:05:54.119
And then don't forget to commend them.

01:05:54.119 --> 01:05:57.119
Because this might be very new for many of our students.

01:05:57.119 --> 01:06:02.119
When they make the effort to prepare, make sure you give appropriate commendation.

01:06:02.119 --> 01:06:05.119
But then, what's the next thing?

01:06:05.119 --> 01:06:08.119
This is something that we sometimes forget, brothers.

01:06:08.119 --> 01:06:14.119
It's the need to teach our students to pray before every single study session.

01:06:14.119 --> 01:06:16.119
Now, why is this important?

01:06:16.119 --> 01:06:23.119
Well, once again, we want our students not just to be thinking in terms of acquiring information

01:06:23.119 --> 01:06:27.119
to not take an academic approach to their study,

01:06:27.119 --> 01:06:32.119
but instead be always thinking about how what they're studying

01:06:32.119 --> 01:06:36.119
connects them with their Heavenly Father, Jehovah,

01:06:36.119 --> 01:06:40.119
so that they're building up a relationship with Him.

01:06:40.119 --> 01:06:42.119
As Proverbs chapter 2 says,

01:06:42.119 --> 01:06:48.119
if we call out to Jehovah for knowledge, for wisdom, for understanding,

01:06:48.119 --> 01:06:52.119
Jehovah will help us. He'll help our student to gain that knowledge

01:06:52.119 --> 01:06:56.119
that they need to build up a good relationship with Him.

01:06:57.119 --> 01:06:59.119
And then, we want to do practical things.

01:06:59.119 --> 01:07:04.119
We want to help our students to become familiar with the digital tools

01:07:04.119 --> 01:07:06.119
that we have at our disposal for study.

01:07:06.119 --> 01:07:11.119
That means helping them to install on their phone, on their tablet,

01:07:11.119 --> 01:07:14.119
or whatever device they have, JW Library,

01:07:14.119 --> 01:07:18.119
showing them how to use Watchtower Online Library

01:07:18.119 --> 01:07:22.119
so that they can get the answers that they need to their questions.

01:07:22.119 --> 01:07:25.119
Do you know, as a February of this year,

01:07:25.119 --> 01:07:32.119
Watchtower Online Library is now available in more than 700 languages,

01:07:32.119 --> 01:07:38.119
so virtually people all over the world have access to these wonderful tools.

01:07:38.119 --> 01:07:43.119
Don't forget also to show them JW.org and JW Broadcasting

01:07:43.119 --> 01:07:46.119
and show them how they can keep up to date

01:07:46.119 --> 01:07:49.119
with these wonderful provisions from Jehovah.

01:07:49.119 --> 01:07:53.119
Well now, we've shown them how to prepare for their lesson.

01:07:54.119 --> 01:07:57.119
We've shown them how to use the online tools.

01:07:57.119 --> 01:08:00.119
But what are the next progressive steps we want to take

01:08:00.119 --> 01:08:03.119
so that they can feed themselves spiritually?

01:08:03.119 --> 01:08:06.119
Well of course, as Psalm 1 tells us,

01:08:06.119 --> 01:08:11.119
if we want to be truly happy and truly well fed spiritually,

01:08:11.119 --> 01:08:18.119
we have to read God's law in an undertone day and night.

01:08:18.119 --> 01:08:21.119
So we want to teach our students to get into that good habit

01:08:22.119 --> 01:08:26.119
of reading God's Word of the Bible every day.

01:08:26.119 --> 01:08:28.119
And then what about the next step?

01:08:28.119 --> 01:08:33.119
We want our students also to be able to prepare for congregation meetings.

01:08:33.119 --> 01:08:37.119
Now, if we've shown them how to use JW Library,

01:08:37.119 --> 01:08:39.119
this is really easy, isn't it?

01:08:39.119 --> 01:08:42.119
All we have to do is basically hit that meeting tab

01:08:42.119 --> 01:08:47.119
and when we do, well all the information for our midweek meeting

01:08:47.119 --> 01:08:50.119
and our weekend meeting is all there for us.

01:08:50.119 --> 01:08:55.119
It will help our students to see that this program of spiritual feeding

01:08:55.119 --> 01:09:00.119
is something they can access and something they can benefit from.

01:09:00.119 --> 01:09:03.119
And what about research questions?

01:09:03.119 --> 01:09:06.119
Now, brothers and sisters, if you have a good student,

01:09:06.119 --> 01:09:09.119
they're going to be asking lots of questions.

01:09:09.119 --> 01:09:13.119
And this is where it's sometimes difficult for us as teachers.

01:09:13.119 --> 01:09:16.119
We would like to be able to just rush in,

01:09:16.119 --> 01:09:20.119
open our Bible and answer every question that our student has.

01:09:20.119 --> 01:09:22.119
But what's the better course?

01:09:22.119 --> 01:09:24.119
Well, we want to be modest.

01:09:24.119 --> 01:09:28.119
And instead of answering all the questions for them,

01:09:28.119 --> 01:09:32.119
how much better it is to go back to those tools,

01:09:32.119 --> 01:09:37.119
go back to the JW Library, go back to Watchtower Online Library,

01:09:37.119 --> 01:09:43.119
and show the student how they can find the answers to their own Bible questions.

01:09:43.119 --> 01:09:48.119
As we do that, we're helping them to build for the future.

01:09:48.119 --> 01:09:51.119
Well, brothers, if we can do this,

01:09:51.119 --> 01:09:58.119
if we can accomplish this goal of teaching our students how to feed themselves spiritually,

01:09:58.119 --> 01:10:01.119
we are not just feeding them today.

01:10:01.119 --> 01:10:04.119
We're not just handing them a fish as it were.

01:10:04.119 --> 01:10:07.119
Instead, we're teaching them how to fish.

01:10:07.119 --> 01:10:12.119
We're teaching them how to feed themselves spiritually for a lifetime.

01:10:12.119 --> 01:10:18.119
Even more important, we're fulfilling the commission that Jesus gave us.

01:10:18.119 --> 01:10:22.119
We are making real disciples of Christ Jesus,

01:10:22.119 --> 01:10:24.119
who are well fed spiritually.

01:10:24.119 --> 01:10:29.119
And as a result, they will not wither up or they will not blow away.

01:10:29.119 --> 01:10:36.119
But instead, they will stand firm as true disciples of Christ Jesus.

01:10:36.119 --> 01:10:40.119
Brother Ronald Curson, a helper with the Teaching Committee,

01:10:40.119 --> 01:10:43.119
will now consider the next talk in this symposium,

01:10:43.119 --> 01:10:47.119
help your Bible students to attend meetings.

01:10:52.909 --> 01:10:57.909
It brings us great joy to help our Bible students feed themselves spiritually,

01:10:57.909 --> 01:11:04.909
so they can continue to make spiritual progress and move ever closer to serving Jehovah.

01:11:04.909 --> 01:11:08.909
The spiritual food that they digest at their weekly Bible study

01:11:08.909 --> 01:11:11.909
or their own personal research is very beneficial.

01:11:11.909 --> 01:11:15.909
It fills that spiritual need, that void in them.

01:11:15.909 --> 01:11:20.909
And it's also very appetizing, much like eating an appetizer.

01:11:20.909 --> 01:11:25.909
An appetizer is something that is served before serving the main course.

01:11:25.909 --> 01:11:29.909
It's meant to wet the appetite before eating the main course.

01:11:29.909 --> 01:11:36.909
Have you invited your Bible student to enjoy the main course of spiritual food at the Kingdom Hall?

01:11:36.909 --> 01:11:42.909
Many have, and they have seen their students advance and really become happier.

01:11:42.909 --> 01:11:44.909
But some have held back.

01:11:44.909 --> 01:11:48.909
They feel that they don't want to rush their student into anything,

01:11:48.909 --> 01:11:50.909
put too much pressure on them.

01:11:50.909 --> 01:11:53.909
But this is exactly what your student needs.

01:11:53.909 --> 01:11:55.909
Invite them as soon as possible.

01:11:55.909 --> 01:12:02.909
Never hold back, because you could possibly be holding them back from making progress.

01:12:02.909 --> 01:12:06.909
Think about how the meetings have helped you personally and your family.

01:12:06.909 --> 01:12:10.909
And think about how the meetings will help your student.

01:12:10.909 --> 01:12:16.909
King David knew that finding joy and true happiness only comes from drawing close to Jehovah

01:12:16.909 --> 01:12:19.909
and worshipping him at his house.

01:12:19.909 --> 01:12:24.909
Notice what he says at Psalm 65 and verse 4.

01:12:24.909 --> 01:12:26.909
He says,

01:12:26.909 --> 01:12:32.909
Happy is the one whom you choose and bring near to reside in your courtyards.

01:12:32.909 --> 01:12:38.909
We will be satisfied with the goodness of your house, your holy temple.

01:12:38.909 --> 01:12:43.909
Well, no doubt your Bible student is happy with their Bible study.

01:12:43.909 --> 01:12:47.909
And what they're learning about Jehovah, they have deep gratitude.

01:12:47.909 --> 01:12:49.909
Well, what is gratitude?

01:12:49.909 --> 01:12:54.909
Gratitude means appreciating what kindness is shown to you.

01:12:54.909 --> 01:12:59.909
But it also means showing appreciation and returning kindness.

01:12:59.909 --> 01:13:07.909
Worshiping Jehovah is how we return kindness, show our appreciation and our gratitude.

01:13:07.909 --> 01:13:13.909
And when we do this, Jehovah is happy, which makes us happy as well.

01:13:13.909 --> 01:13:21.909
Notice in the following dramatization how Nida invites her Bible study Jade to attend meetings.

01:13:22.909 --> 01:13:26.909
Yeah, assisted died in that attack.

01:13:26.909 --> 01:13:28.909
It was really sad.

01:13:28.909 --> 01:13:32.909
That's time and unexpected events.

01:13:32.909 --> 01:13:35.909
Well, it's one of those cases.

01:13:35.909 --> 01:13:38.909
What about when someone survives because they're at the meeting?

01:13:38.909 --> 01:13:40.909
That's...

01:13:40.909 --> 01:13:42.909
I don't get it.

01:13:42.909 --> 01:13:43.909
Straight answer.

01:13:43.909 --> 01:13:46.909
Does Jehovah protect witnesses or not?

01:13:46.909 --> 01:13:47.909
Funny.

01:13:47.909 --> 01:13:50.909
My meeting part tonight covers that point.

01:13:50.909 --> 01:13:52.909
Why don't you come?

01:13:52.909 --> 01:13:59.779
You're really pushing those meetings, aren't you?

01:13:59.779 --> 01:14:59.569
What time?

01:14:59.569 --> 01:15:02.569
Leave, I missed her part.

01:15:02.569 --> 01:15:05.569
But it wasn't a total loss.

01:15:05.569 --> 01:15:19.300
Nida had said, at the hall, everyone loves one another.

01:15:19.300 --> 01:15:25.029
But until I felt it, I had no idea.

01:15:25.029 --> 01:15:31.449
I told her I'd be back.

01:15:31.449 --> 01:15:34.449
How did Jade feel when she attended her first meeting?

01:15:34.449 --> 01:15:36.449
Well, she really enjoyed it.

01:15:36.449 --> 01:15:42.449
She remembered what Nida told her that everyone at the kingdom hall loves one another.

01:15:42.449 --> 01:15:47.449
And Jade had to admit, but until I felt it, I had no idea.

01:15:47.449 --> 01:15:49.449
She could have read it.

01:15:49.449 --> 01:15:50.449
She could have heard about it.

01:15:50.449 --> 01:15:56.449
But until she was there and feeling the love, she wanted to come back.

01:15:56.449 --> 01:16:01.449
Yes, attending meetings goes hand in hand with making spiritual progress.

01:16:01.449 --> 01:16:05.449
As much as they love their home Bible study, it's like an appetizer.

01:16:05.449 --> 01:16:11.449
It's one part of the spiritual feeding program that Jehovah provides at the kingdom hall

01:16:11.449 --> 01:16:15.449
that main course provided through the faithful slave.

01:16:15.449 --> 01:16:21.449
So during each Bible study, it would be good to explain to your student what has affected you,

01:16:21.449 --> 01:16:26.449
what impacted you, to help make wise decisions, what encouraged you, share it with them,

01:16:26.449 --> 01:16:29.449
and share a point that would help them.

01:16:29.449 --> 01:16:32.449
Again, wet their appetite, peak their interest.

01:16:32.449 --> 01:16:40.449
And when they come to the meeting, they will see true Christian love, unfailing love, in action.

01:16:40.449 --> 01:16:46.449
They will see others trying to put into action and applying what they're learning at the meetings.

01:16:46.449 --> 01:16:52.449
They will make true friends that will help support them and help them to progress spiritually.

01:16:52.449 --> 01:16:57.449
Attending meetings can be a bit intimidating for some and cause some anxiety.

01:16:57.449 --> 01:17:02.449
So it would be good to explain to them what they might expect when they attend.

01:17:02.449 --> 01:17:09.449
And one of the best ways to do this is showing them a video entitled What Happens at a Kingdom Hall.

01:17:09.449 --> 01:17:17.449
And this will really put them at ease and really help them to have less anxiety when they do finally come.

01:17:17.449 --> 01:17:23.449
It would be good to also invite others to the Bible study so that when your student does finally make it to the meeting,

01:17:23.449 --> 01:17:28.449
they will see many familiar faces and feel much more comfortable.

01:17:28.449 --> 01:17:34.449
And let the friends at the congregation know that your student is coming to the meeting so that when they walk into the door,

01:17:34.449 --> 01:17:38.449
they can come over, give them a warm welcome. Make them feel comfortable.

01:17:38.449 --> 01:17:44.449
This is what Nita did for Jade and it worked so well. It helped her to progress.

01:17:44.449 --> 01:17:50.449
Your student is a guest in Jehovah's house. Make them feel special.

01:17:50.449 --> 01:17:57.449
Make them feel comfortable by offering practical help before the meeting as well as during the meeting.

01:17:57.449 --> 01:18:03.449
So well in advance, what their appetite and what they will learn once they come to the meeting.

01:18:03.449 --> 01:18:09.449
It's like showing them a menu of what they will enjoy with the main course at the meeting.

01:18:09.449 --> 01:18:16.449
Offer to provide a ride to your students and have them sit with you at the meetings.

01:18:16.449 --> 01:18:21.449
It would also be good to make sure that they have the publications that will be discussed at the meeting.

01:18:21.449 --> 01:18:26.449
Either hard copy or have it downloaded on their device.

01:18:26.449 --> 01:18:35.449
As we have discussed, attending meetings and enjoying the main course of spiritual food at the Kingdom Hall will help your student in so many ways.

01:18:35.449 --> 01:18:42.449
It will make them feel happier, helps them to continue progressing so they can draw close to Jehovah.

01:18:42.449 --> 01:18:47.449
The Apostle Paul gives us some more indications on what your student can enjoy.

01:18:47.449 --> 01:18:53.449
Please, notice with me what he says at Colossians chapter 2 and verse 7.

01:18:53.449 --> 01:19:02.449
He said in verse 6 that they should keep on walking but then in verse 7 that they should be rooted and built up in him, Jesus,

01:19:02.449 --> 01:19:09.449
and being stabilized into faith just as you were taught and then overflowing with thanksgiving.

01:19:09.449 --> 01:19:16.449
So their appreciation, their gratitude, they will want to go to the meetings and worship Jehovah.

01:19:16.449 --> 01:19:25.449
So continue to find joy in helping your student feed themselves spiritually but also help them to appreciate attending meetings on a weekly basis.

01:19:25.449 --> 01:19:32.449
Make it a way of life for them so they can enjoy everlasting life.

01:19:32.449 --> 01:19:42.449
Brother Kenneth Cook, a member of the governing body will now consider the next part of this symposium entitled Help Your Bible Students to Avoid Bad Associations.

01:19:42.449 --> 01:19:59.460
To begin, let's illustrate the importance of helping our Bible students to avoid bad association and will use the example of a prospector.

01:19:59.460 --> 01:20:05.460
When a prospector finds something valuable deep underground, what does he do?

01:20:05.460 --> 01:20:10.460
He must make certain that the weigh-in is secured and that it's well supported.

01:20:10.460 --> 01:20:15.460
Otherwise, the treasure might be plundered or the weigh-in could collapse.

01:20:15.460 --> 01:20:21.460
This is similar to what we must be aware of when it comes to helping our Bible students.

01:20:21.460 --> 01:20:25.460
We work hard to reach the hearts of responsive ones, don't we?

01:20:25.460 --> 01:20:32.460
When we do, with Jehovah's help, we continue assisting them to secure and protect their hearts.

01:20:32.460 --> 01:20:37.460
This includes protecting their growing faith in Jehovah.

01:20:37.460 --> 01:20:43.460
Otherwise, the devil will ruin what has been done and strip them of their faith.

01:20:43.460 --> 01:20:52.460
If we are to help our students to progress, we must keep in mind why avoiding bad associations is so important.

01:20:52.460 --> 01:20:58.460
We must also have in mind how we can help our students to do this.

01:20:58.460 --> 01:21:02.460
Let's first look at why this is so important.

01:21:02.460 --> 01:21:10.460
In order for your Bible students to gain Jehovah's friendship, they will likely need to make some changes in their choice of association.

01:21:10.460 --> 01:21:18.460
Why? Because your students' progress is greatly affected by his or her choice of friends.

01:21:18.460 --> 01:21:25.460
Proverbs 13 and verse 20 explains why this is true. Please go to that verse.

01:21:25.460 --> 01:21:29.460
Proverbs 13-20, it reads,

01:21:29.460 --> 01:21:38.460
The one walking with the wise will become wise, but the one who has dealings with the stupid will fare badly.

01:21:38.460 --> 01:21:45.460
Why does a person's choice of associates matter? Because we cannot change what the verse says here.

01:21:45.460 --> 01:21:51.460
The one who is walking or has dealings with the stupid will fare badly.

01:21:51.460 --> 01:21:57.460
The fact is that our friends affect us in either a good way or a bad way, don't they?

01:21:57.460 --> 01:22:04.460
In the Hebrew language, to have dealings with someone can mean to keep company with a person.

01:22:04.460 --> 01:22:07.460
That is to be friends with a person.

01:22:07.460 --> 01:22:13.460
If a Bible student seeks company with senseless people, he or she will not progress spiritually.

01:22:13.460 --> 01:22:21.460
That is why it is so important to help our Bible students to avoid the problems that come with bad association.

01:22:21.460 --> 01:22:29.460
On the other hand, from Proverbs 13-20, we learn that the one walking with the wise will become wise.

01:22:29.460 --> 01:22:36.460
Here, the idea of walking with someone involves choosing to spend time with a person.

01:22:36.460 --> 01:22:39.460
So help your Bible students to choose well.

01:22:39.460 --> 01:22:47.460
Wholesome associates in the truth will help your students to break free from worldly thinking and unclean practices.

01:22:47.460 --> 01:22:55.460
With this in mind, now that we have considered why we must help them, let's look some more at how we can do so.

01:22:55.460 --> 01:23:05.460
In the following dramatization, note how Nita helps her Bible student to seek out and select good associates or friends.

01:23:06.460 --> 01:23:13.670
Do not be misled, bad associations spoil useful habits.

01:23:13.670 --> 01:23:19.340
Okay, but what's good associations?

01:23:19.340 --> 01:23:24.340
Well, we have wholesome gatherings with our brothers and sisters from the congregation.

01:23:24.340 --> 01:23:32.340
And we eat and talk, and some like to play musical instruments, and they'll do renditions of original songs.

01:23:32.340 --> 01:23:44.170
And we have a really nice time.

01:23:44.170 --> 01:23:47.170
Yeah, I don't do that.

01:23:47.170 --> 01:23:49.170
It's not boring.

01:23:49.170 --> 01:23:51.170
Sure, it's not.

01:23:51.170 --> 01:23:53.170
Well, what do you do?

01:23:53.170 --> 01:24:18.020
You wouldn't do that.

01:24:18.020 --> 01:24:21.020
It's not exactly wholesome.

01:24:21.020 --> 01:24:23.020
But you've got to have fun, right?

01:24:23.020 --> 01:24:24.020
True.

01:24:24.020 --> 01:24:27.020
And we do.

01:24:27.020 --> 01:24:28.020
See for yourself.

01:24:28.020 --> 01:24:31.020
I'm having some people over this weekend.

01:24:31.020 --> 01:24:32.020
Why don't you come?

01:24:32.020 --> 01:25:07.390
It wasn't the club.

01:25:07.390 --> 01:25:13.369
But it was still fun.

01:25:13.369 --> 01:25:18.369
Did you take note of how Nita helped her Bible student to seek good friends?

01:25:18.369 --> 01:25:22.369
For one thing, she was empathetic, wasn't she?

01:25:22.369 --> 01:25:30.369
Nita understood that her Bible student would need to see and experience some things for herself.

01:25:30.369 --> 01:25:35.369
Also, she invited her student to a gathering of brothers and sisters,

01:25:35.369 --> 01:25:40.369
and the impact of that positive experience was obvious.

01:25:40.369 --> 01:25:44.369
Likewise, when it comes to how we can help our Bible students,

01:25:44.369 --> 01:25:47.369
remember to be empathetic as well.

01:25:47.369 --> 01:25:50.369
All of us naturally desire to have friends.

01:25:50.369 --> 01:25:54.369
Keep that in mind as you strive to help your students.

01:25:54.369 --> 01:25:57.369
It can be difficult for them to seek out good associates.

01:25:57.369 --> 01:26:01.369
After all, this is all new for them.

01:26:01.369 --> 01:26:07.369
Added to this, as your students accept and apply Bible standards in their lives,

01:26:07.369 --> 01:26:11.369
some of their former friends will likely reject them.

01:26:11.369 --> 01:26:16.369
You can prepare them for this by showing them what the Bible says, for example,

01:26:16.369 --> 01:26:20.369
at 1 Peter 4, verse 4.

01:26:20.369 --> 01:26:25.369
In that verse, we are made aware that people would be puzzled over the changes we make

01:26:25.369 --> 01:26:28.369
in order to please Jehovah.

01:26:28.369 --> 01:26:35.369
It also tells us that people might speak abusively of us and reject our changes.

01:26:35.369 --> 01:26:39.369
This could even include members of one's own family,

01:26:39.369 --> 01:26:43.369
and that fact might be difficult for your students to accept.

01:26:43.369 --> 01:26:50.369
How can you help your students at a time like that by giving them a real choice?

01:26:50.369 --> 01:26:54.369
Along with helping them to draw close to Jehovah,

01:26:54.369 --> 01:26:59.369
help your students to replace bad associations with good ones.

01:26:59.369 --> 01:27:02.369
Be a friend to your students.

01:27:02.369 --> 01:27:06.369
Also, introduce them to others in the congregation.

01:27:06.369 --> 01:27:10.369
Also, whenever possible, when the study is over,

01:27:10.369 --> 01:27:14.369
why not stay for a while and talk with them, spend some time,

01:27:14.369 --> 01:27:17.369
and really get to know them?

01:27:17.369 --> 01:27:21.369
Call your student whenever he or she is sick.

01:27:21.369 --> 01:27:23.369
Show personal interest.

01:27:23.369 --> 01:27:28.369
Sit with them at the meetings and invite others to sit in on the study with you.

01:27:28.369 --> 01:27:32.369
If you are interested in the video, like Nita,

01:27:32.369 --> 01:27:36.369
include your student in upbuilding social activities.

01:27:36.369 --> 01:27:40.369
One formerly unbelieving husband, who is now an elder,

01:27:40.369 --> 01:27:43.369
recalls how a brother helped him.

01:27:43.369 --> 01:27:46.369
He said that the brother took a day off from work

01:27:46.369 --> 01:27:49.369
just to watch a ball game with him,

01:27:49.369 --> 01:27:51.369
and he thought to himself,

01:27:51.369 --> 01:27:53.369
he's normal.

01:27:53.369 --> 01:27:57.369
It's also important to help your Bible student understand

01:27:57.369 --> 01:28:01.369
that you are limited to morally debased people.

01:28:01.369 --> 01:28:05.369
The Bible tells us that the whole world,

01:28:05.369 --> 01:28:10.369
the whole world, is lying in the power of the wicked one.

01:28:10.369 --> 01:28:13.369
So then kindly help your students to see

01:28:13.369 --> 01:28:16.369
that we must also avoid association

01:28:16.369 --> 01:28:19.369
with those who may appear to be morally clean,

01:28:19.369 --> 01:28:24.369
but who lack faith in the true God, Jehovah.

01:28:24.369 --> 01:28:29.369
We see why we must help and how we can help our Bible students

01:28:29.369 --> 01:28:33.369
to avoid bad associations and accept good ones.

01:28:33.369 --> 01:28:38.369
Remember, we must help them to secure the way into their heart

01:28:38.369 --> 01:28:40.369
and protect their faith.

01:28:40.369 --> 01:28:44.369
As your students do this by avoiding bad associations,

01:28:44.369 --> 01:28:49.369
they will no doubt gain many lifelong friends, including you.

01:28:49.369 --> 01:28:52.369
And whether your student is a family member

01:28:52.369 --> 01:28:55.369
or someone you meet in the ministry,

01:28:55.369 --> 01:28:57.369
you will both have precious memories

01:28:57.369 --> 01:29:01.369
and joy that will last forever.

01:29:01.369 --> 01:29:05.619
Brother Anthony Morris, a member of the governing body,

01:29:05.619 --> 01:29:09.619
will now consider the next talk of this symposium,

01:29:09.619 --> 01:29:14.619
help your Bible students to overcome unclean habits.

01:29:14.619 --> 01:29:24.590
In this part of our symposium,

01:29:24.590 --> 01:29:28.590
we are addressing why and how

01:29:28.590 --> 01:29:33.590
to help our Bible students overcome unclean habits.

01:29:33.590 --> 01:29:39.590
Now, first of all, why overcome unclean habits?

01:29:39.590 --> 01:29:43.590
As teachers, we need to reach the heart of those we study

01:29:43.590 --> 01:29:50.590
with to understand the God we worship expects this to stop.

01:29:50.590 --> 01:29:54.590
Let me show you a verse that you're familiar with many of you

01:29:54.590 --> 01:29:58.590
and Peter's letter, first Peter chapter one,

01:29:58.590 --> 01:30:03.590
and we could use these thoughts here to endeavor

01:30:03.590 --> 01:30:07.590
to reach the heart of those we're studying with with why

01:30:07.590 --> 01:30:10.590
this unclean habit must stop.

01:30:10.590 --> 01:30:13.590
Let's read verse 14 through 16,

01:30:13.590 --> 01:30:17.590
as obedient children stop being molded

01:30:17.590 --> 01:30:21.590
by the desires you formerly had in your ignorance,

01:30:21.590 --> 01:30:24.590
but like the holy one who called you,

01:30:24.590 --> 01:30:29.590
become holy yourselves in all your conduct.

01:30:29.590 --> 01:30:35.590
For it is written, you must be holy because I am holy.

01:30:35.590 --> 01:30:39.590
So it's very clear here there are things

01:30:39.590 --> 01:30:45.590
that are Bible studies practiced before these unclean habits

01:30:45.590 --> 01:30:48.590
in their ignorance, before they knew Jehovah,

01:30:48.590 --> 01:30:51.590
before they knew his requirements,

01:30:51.590 --> 01:30:55.590
they need to understand he is the holy one,

01:30:55.590 --> 01:30:58.590
and they have to have their conduct line up

01:30:58.590 --> 01:31:01.590
with the holy one that we worship.

01:31:01.590 --> 01:31:05.590
And this is not a suggestion as quoting the scripture here

01:31:05.590 --> 01:31:08.590
in verse 16, it's a must.

01:31:08.590 --> 01:31:13.590
They must be holy because Jehovah is holy.

01:31:13.590 --> 01:31:16.590
Now in the following dramatization,

01:31:16.590 --> 01:31:21.590
note how Nita helps her Bible student to overcome

01:31:21.590 --> 01:31:23.590
an unclean habit.

01:31:23.590 --> 01:31:42.979
Nita and I talked about her.

01:31:42.979 --> 01:31:44.979
Part of me felt a bit scared,

01:31:44.979 --> 01:31:47.979
part a bit crazy,

01:31:47.979 --> 01:31:49.979
me knocking on doors,

01:31:49.979 --> 01:31:55.119
but I knew this was the right thing to do.

01:31:55.119 --> 01:31:57.119
A minister should also be free

01:31:57.119 --> 01:32:02.119
from all non-medical use of addictive or mind-altering substances.

01:32:02.119 --> 01:32:07.380
Non-medical,

01:32:07.380 --> 01:32:11.380
but taking something when I'm feeling a little stressed,

01:32:11.380 --> 01:32:14.380
like maybe I don't know,

01:32:14.380 --> 01:32:17.380
a little weed?

01:32:17.380 --> 01:32:20.380
That's okay, right?

01:32:20.380 --> 01:32:22.380
And it's for the stress.

01:32:22.380 --> 01:32:30.479
I guess I didn't quite understand what medical men...

01:32:30.479 --> 01:32:32.479
So we see you during the week.

01:32:32.479 --> 01:32:33.479
Thank you, Jody.

01:32:33.479 --> 01:32:36.939
Thanks.

01:32:36.939 --> 01:32:37.939
We'll be back.

01:32:37.939 --> 01:32:39.939
You can guess what our next few studies were about.

01:32:39.939 --> 01:32:42.939
And you should continue to be made new

01:32:42.939 --> 01:32:45.939
in your dominant mental attitude.

01:32:45.939 --> 01:32:48.939
Knowing it was wrong was easy,

01:32:48.939 --> 01:32:53.739
figuring out how to cope without it

01:32:53.739 --> 01:33:07.100
wasn't beating it

01:33:07.100 --> 01:33:10.100
felt impossible.

01:33:10.100 --> 01:33:36.239
Deserve Jehovah felt amazing.

01:33:36.239 --> 01:33:48.079
Next, let's discuss how to help.

01:33:48.079 --> 01:33:51.079
We see how our sister needed

01:33:51.079 --> 01:33:53.079
to help her Bible student

01:33:53.079 --> 01:33:56.079
when she became aware of that unclean habit.

01:33:56.079 --> 01:33:58.079
But there's some nice thoughts

01:33:58.079 --> 01:34:04.079
as to how to help our Bible students overcome unclean habits.

01:34:04.079 --> 01:34:07.079
Now, we want to be candid

01:34:07.079 --> 01:34:09.079
and clear from the scriptures,

01:34:09.079 --> 01:34:12.079
but always remember we need to be warm

01:34:12.079 --> 01:34:14.079
and we need to be

01:34:14.079 --> 01:34:16.079
tactful with them.

01:34:16.079 --> 01:34:18.079
These habits have a grip on them

01:34:18.079 --> 01:34:20.079
and we need to display not

01:34:20.079 --> 01:34:23.079
a judgmental attitude, but patience

01:34:23.079 --> 01:34:26.079
and really just imitating Jehovah

01:34:26.079 --> 01:34:30.079
helping them to apply Bible counsel.

01:34:30.079 --> 01:34:32.079
Now, it's important for the teacher to understand

01:34:32.079 --> 01:34:34.079
what we're going to share with you next.

01:34:34.079 --> 01:34:37.079
And then if you have it clear,

01:34:37.079 --> 01:34:39.079
you're going to be able to impart it

01:34:39.079 --> 01:34:41.079
to your Bible student.

01:34:41.079 --> 01:34:44.079
Let's read a familiar scripture

01:34:44.079 --> 01:34:48.079
in Ephesians chapter 4.

01:34:48.079 --> 01:34:50.079
And it's important to understand

01:34:50.079 --> 01:34:53.079
what we read here

01:34:53.079 --> 01:34:56.079
as related to helping them overcome

01:34:56.079 --> 01:35:00.079
unclean habits that go contrary

01:35:00.079 --> 01:35:02.079
to Bible principles.

01:35:02.079 --> 01:35:05.079
Now, notice in Ephesians chapter 4

01:35:05.079 --> 01:35:10.079
verse 22, 23 and 24.

01:35:10.079 --> 01:35:13.079
You were taught to put away the old personality

01:35:13.079 --> 01:35:17.079
that conforms to your former course of conduct

01:35:17.079 --> 01:35:19.079
and that has been corrupted

01:35:19.079 --> 01:35:21.079
according to it's that's the old personality

01:35:21.079 --> 01:35:24.079
deceptive desires.

01:35:24.079 --> 01:35:27.079
And you should continue to be made new

01:35:27.079 --> 01:35:30.079
in your dominant mental attitude

01:35:30.079 --> 01:35:32.079
and should put on the new personality

01:35:32.079 --> 01:35:35.079
that was created according to God's will

01:35:35.079 --> 01:35:39.079
in true righteousness and loyalty.

01:35:39.079 --> 01:35:43.079
So we have to understand this clearly

01:35:43.079 --> 01:35:45.079
and then we need to teach our students

01:35:45.079 --> 01:35:47.079
there's the old personality.

01:35:47.079 --> 01:35:50.079
Those of us that came in the truth

01:35:50.079 --> 01:35:52.079
had old personalities.

01:35:52.079 --> 01:35:55.079
We know exactly what Paul's writing

01:35:55.079 --> 01:35:57.079
to the Ephesians about.

01:35:57.079 --> 01:35:59.079
And that's a former course of conduct

01:35:59.079 --> 01:36:02.079
that is no longer acceptable.

01:36:02.079 --> 01:36:06.079
But the key to being able to put on the new personality

01:36:06.079 --> 01:36:09.079
and put away the old one

01:36:09.079 --> 01:36:11.079
is found in verse 23

01:36:11.079 --> 01:36:15.079
be made new in your dominant mental attitude.

01:36:15.079 --> 01:36:18.079
So what's that mean?

01:36:18.079 --> 01:36:22.079
That means your Bible students

01:36:22.079 --> 01:36:25.079
thinking has to change.

01:36:25.079 --> 01:36:28.079
The thinking has to change

01:36:28.079 --> 01:36:30.079
into this new personality

01:36:30.079 --> 01:36:33.079
thinking that's guided and directed by Jehovah

01:36:33.079 --> 01:36:35.079
and His Word.

01:36:35.079 --> 01:36:38.079
Now to illustrate what I mean by that

01:36:38.079 --> 01:36:40.079
tell you a personal experience

01:36:40.079 --> 01:36:42.079
with a Bible study

01:36:42.079 --> 01:36:44.079
that I had many years ago

01:36:44.079 --> 01:36:46.079
and really appreciate it

01:36:46.079 --> 01:36:48.079
how Jehovah helped him.

01:36:48.079 --> 01:36:50.079
Now when I studied with him,

01:36:50.079 --> 01:36:53.079
he was 70, early 70s

01:36:53.079 --> 01:36:57.079
and he had smoked cigarettes

01:36:57.079 --> 01:36:59.079
since he was eight years old.

01:36:59.079 --> 01:37:01.079
That's phenomenal.

01:37:01.079 --> 01:37:03.079
I smoked before I became

01:37:03.079 --> 01:37:07.079
one of Jehovah's Witnesses with decades?

01:37:07.079 --> 01:37:08.079
No.

01:37:08.079 --> 01:37:11.079
So smoking had a grip on him

01:37:11.079 --> 01:37:13.079
that old personality

01:37:13.079 --> 01:37:15.079
that was very discouraging

01:37:15.079 --> 01:37:17.079
and difficult for him.

01:37:17.079 --> 01:37:20.079
However, he was making progress,

01:37:20.079 --> 01:37:21.079
coming to meetings.

01:37:21.079 --> 01:37:24.079
And this one example

01:37:24.079 --> 01:37:26.079
that had one of his life

01:37:26.079 --> 01:37:27.079
will illustrate the point

01:37:27.079 --> 01:37:28.079
we're making here.

01:37:28.079 --> 01:37:30.079
So I'm working in a department

01:37:30.079 --> 01:37:32.079
there at the convention

01:37:32.079 --> 01:37:35.079
and it's near the lobby area.

01:37:35.079 --> 01:37:37.079
And I noticed my Bible study,

01:37:37.079 --> 01:37:40.079
he heads out and programs ongoing,

01:37:40.079 --> 01:37:42.079
heads out the door

01:37:42.079 --> 01:37:43.079
and out of personal interest,

01:37:43.079 --> 01:37:45.079
not to police him,

01:37:45.079 --> 01:37:47.079
I want to go see,

01:37:47.079 --> 01:37:48.079
is he okay?

01:37:48.079 --> 01:37:50.079
So he's about a block

01:37:50.079 --> 01:37:52.079
down from the lobby

01:37:52.079 --> 01:37:54.079
of the convention center

01:37:54.079 --> 01:37:55.079
and you know what?

01:37:55.079 --> 01:37:58.079
Smoking a cigarette.

01:37:58.079 --> 01:38:00.079
So he notices me come up

01:38:00.079 --> 01:38:03.079
behind him and it just hits him.

01:38:03.079 --> 01:38:05.079
And he's contrived.

01:38:05.079 --> 01:38:07.079
The shame is all in his face.

01:38:07.079 --> 01:38:08.079
And he throws that cigarette

01:38:08.079 --> 01:38:11.079
down, stops it with a shoe.

01:38:11.079 --> 01:38:13.079
So when I get close to him,

01:38:13.079 --> 01:38:16.079
he says, I've been asking Jehovah,

01:38:16.079 --> 01:38:18.079
forgive me, forgive me.

01:38:18.079 --> 01:38:19.079
This happens.

01:38:19.079 --> 01:38:21.079
I always ask him to forgive me.

01:38:21.079 --> 01:38:23.079
And I said, well, that's commendable.

01:38:23.079 --> 01:38:24.079
That's so important.

01:38:24.079 --> 01:38:26.079
I know you loved Jehovah.

01:38:26.079 --> 01:38:29.079
However, here's what you need to learn.

01:38:29.079 --> 01:38:33.079
See, you need to approach Jehovah

01:38:33.079 --> 01:38:37.079
before and supplicate him

01:38:37.079 --> 01:38:41.079
before you take that cigarette.

01:38:41.079 --> 01:38:44.079
And that's what our Bible students need to help.

01:38:44.079 --> 01:38:46.079
It's important that they have to

01:38:46.079 --> 01:38:50.079
suffocate Jehovah before that unclean habit

01:38:50.079 --> 01:38:52.079
overwhelms them.

01:38:52.079 --> 01:38:56.079
And I'm happy to say he did.

01:38:56.079 --> 01:38:58.079
Turn his back on that.

01:38:58.079 --> 01:39:00.079
I've been supplicated Jehovah.

01:39:00.079 --> 01:39:03.079
And boy, imagine smoking all those decades

01:39:03.079 --> 01:39:07.079
and died a faithful servant of Jehovah God.

01:39:07.079 --> 01:39:11.079
So help your Bible students

01:39:11.079 --> 01:39:12.079
and keep that in mind.

01:39:12.079 --> 01:39:14.079
They have to change their thinking.

01:39:14.079 --> 01:39:17.079
And that's our responsibility to make that clear to them.

01:39:17.079 --> 01:39:19.079
Now teach them, too,

01:39:19.079 --> 01:39:22.079
by means of practical assistance.

01:39:22.079 --> 01:39:25.079
Be a dear friend for them.

01:39:25.079 --> 01:39:27.079
Stay there for them.

01:39:27.079 --> 01:39:30.079
When they need help with something.

01:39:30.079 --> 01:39:31.079
And just love them.

01:39:31.079 --> 01:39:32.079
Don't be judgmental.

01:39:32.079 --> 01:39:34.079
Be supportive.

01:39:34.079 --> 01:39:38.079
And help them to overcome these unclean habits.

01:39:38.079 --> 01:39:40.079
And very important,

01:39:40.079 --> 01:39:43.079
teach them, do not give up.

01:39:43.079 --> 01:39:45.079
Jehovah loves you.

01:39:45.079 --> 01:39:48.079
He wants you to rejoice in the progress you're making.

01:39:48.079 --> 01:39:50.079
He loves you.

01:39:50.079 --> 01:39:52.079
And what's your experience

01:39:52.079 --> 01:39:55.079
when they become a dedicated witness

01:39:55.079 --> 01:39:57.079
or a fellow servant of God,

01:39:57.079 --> 01:40:02.079
you'll have a friend forever.

01:40:02.079 --> 01:40:06.079
Now, next on our symposium,

01:40:06.079 --> 01:40:08.079
the final talk,

01:40:08.079 --> 01:40:10.079
Brother Jeffrey Jackson,

01:40:10.079 --> 01:40:13.079
remember the governing body is going to consider the talk,

01:40:13.079 --> 01:40:16.079
help your Bible students to develop

01:40:16.079 --> 01:40:27.250
a personal relationship with Jehovah.

01:40:27.250 --> 01:40:29.250
How does a father feel

01:40:29.250 --> 01:40:33.250
when he receives an unexpected gift from his child?

01:40:33.250 --> 01:40:36.250
Of course, his heart is warmed.

01:40:36.250 --> 01:40:37.250
Why?

01:40:37.250 --> 01:40:40.250
Because he sees this as an expression

01:40:40.250 --> 01:40:42.250
of the child's love for him.

01:40:42.250 --> 01:40:44.250
Well, in a similar way,

01:40:44.250 --> 01:40:47.250
our loving Heavenly Father, Jehovah,

01:40:47.250 --> 01:40:50.250
does not want to force us to serve him.

01:40:50.250 --> 01:40:52.250
He's interested in our motives.

01:40:52.250 --> 01:40:56.250
And he wants us to serve him out of love.

01:40:56.250 --> 01:40:58.250
Why?

01:40:58.250 --> 01:41:02.250
Because Jehovah realizes that love has power.

01:41:02.250 --> 01:41:05.250
It gives us the power to make changes in our life.

01:41:05.250 --> 01:41:10.250
And also, it helps us to be able to overcome temptations

01:41:10.250 --> 01:41:13.500
and opposition.

01:41:13.500 --> 01:41:15.500
But that presents a challenge for us

01:41:15.500 --> 01:41:17.500
when we're conducting Bible studies.

01:41:17.500 --> 01:41:19.500
How so?

01:41:19.500 --> 01:41:24.500
Well, how can we develop within the hearts of the Bible students

01:41:24.500 --> 01:41:28.500
a love for Jehovah without forcing them

01:41:28.500 --> 01:41:31.500
or trying to put pressure on them?

01:41:31.500 --> 01:41:35.500
Well, that's something that we need to think about.

01:41:35.500 --> 01:41:38.500
During these talks, we've certainly enjoyed the series

01:41:38.500 --> 01:41:40.500
of videos, haven't we,

01:41:40.500 --> 01:41:42.500
that have helped us to see how Jade

01:41:42.500 --> 01:41:45.500
has made progress with her Bible study

01:41:45.500 --> 01:41:49.500
and how Nita has helped her all along.

01:41:49.500 --> 01:41:51.500
When we think about this,

01:41:51.500 --> 01:41:55.500
we see that Jade has made good progress.

01:41:55.500 --> 01:41:58.500
And she's up to a point now

01:41:58.500 --> 01:42:01.500
where she has a love for Jehovah.

01:42:01.500 --> 01:42:03.500
In this final video,

01:42:03.500 --> 01:42:08.500
let's watch how Jade faces a very difficult problem

01:42:08.500 --> 01:42:11.500
and we'll see how her love for Jehovah

01:42:11.500 --> 01:42:14.500
helps us to overcome this problem.

01:42:14.500 --> 01:42:16.500
But Mom, listen.

01:42:16.500 --> 01:42:18.500
No, Jade. You listen.

01:42:18.500 --> 01:42:21.500
It'll lift just another of your favors.

01:42:21.500 --> 01:42:24.500
It's time to move on, Love.

01:42:24.500 --> 01:42:27.500
The holidays are our time.

01:42:27.500 --> 01:42:29.500
It's all I get from you.

01:42:29.500 --> 01:42:50.859
Promise me you'll be here.

01:42:50.859 --> 01:42:52.859
I really don't want to disappoint her.

01:42:52.859 --> 01:42:56.390
I can't disappoint Jehovah.

01:42:56.390 --> 01:42:58.390
Of course.

01:42:58.390 --> 01:43:00.390
You love them both.

01:43:00.390 --> 01:43:02.390
Don't you think you can help you?

01:43:02.390 --> 01:43:11.460
Talk to him.

01:43:11.460 --> 01:43:14.460
I spent a long time pouring out my heart to him.

01:43:14.460 --> 01:43:26.689
And I remembered something from one of the Psalms.

01:43:26.689 --> 01:43:35.350
I will walk in your truth.

01:43:35.350 --> 01:43:38.350
Unify my heart to fear your name.

01:43:38.350 --> 01:44:36.779
Remember someone wants claiming to be all about the promises?

01:44:36.779 --> 01:44:38.779
Have you made any good ones lately?

01:44:38.779 --> 01:44:40.779
Absolutely.

01:44:40.779 --> 01:44:49.890
Well, that certainly was a difficult problem, wasn't it?

01:44:49.890 --> 01:44:54.890
Her mother wanting to force her to join her in a worldly holiday.

01:44:54.890 --> 01:44:57.890
But what helped Jade?

01:44:57.890 --> 01:45:00.890
As she said, it's true she loves her mother.

01:45:00.890 --> 01:45:03.890
But she didn't want to disappoint Jehovah.

01:45:04.890 --> 01:45:08.890
And not as neither didn't try to go through all the pros and cons with her.

01:45:08.890 --> 01:45:11.890
She realized that Jade had a love for Jehovah.

01:45:11.890 --> 01:45:15.890
And she just simply said, ask him for help.

01:45:15.890 --> 01:45:18.890
And Jehovah did help her.

01:45:18.890 --> 01:45:24.890
So how can we make sure that our Bible students come to a similar point in their life

01:45:24.890 --> 01:45:27.890
where they love Jehovah?

01:45:27.890 --> 01:45:30.890
Well, we find some help with regard to that question.

01:45:30.890 --> 01:45:37.890
If we turn to the first book of John, so please turn with me to 1 John chapter 4.

01:45:37.890 --> 01:45:39.890
And we're going to read verse 8.

01:45:39.890 --> 01:45:48.869
Whoever does not love has not come to know God because God is love.

01:45:48.869 --> 01:45:51.869
What is this telling us?

01:45:51.869 --> 01:45:56.869
You see, basically it is saying if our Bible student doesn't love God,

01:45:56.869 --> 01:46:00.869
that's because they haven't really come to know God yet.

01:46:00.869 --> 01:46:06.869
And if we turn the page to verse 19, there's a secondary point as mentioned.

01:46:06.869 --> 01:46:12.869
It says, we love because He first loved us.

01:46:12.869 --> 01:46:14.869
What does this highlight?

01:46:14.869 --> 01:46:19.869
Well, for our Bible student to love Jehovah, they need to come to know Him.

01:46:19.869 --> 01:46:24.869
But also, they need to see His love in their lives.

01:46:24.869 --> 01:46:29.869
So that puts a responsibility on us to help them to identify

01:46:29.869 --> 01:46:35.869
Jehovah's love and then have this love for Jehovah building their hearts.

01:46:35.869 --> 01:46:41.869
We can do that by asking questions such as, how have you seen Jehovah's love in your life?

01:46:41.869 --> 01:46:43.869
Well, what does this Bible account?

01:46:43.869 --> 01:46:46.869
Teachers about Jehovah's love.

01:46:46.869 --> 01:46:51.869
In other words, although we are interested in explaining what Jehovah has done

01:46:51.869 --> 01:46:56.869
by highlighting what he does, how he does it, and when he does it,

01:46:56.869 --> 01:47:02.869
we would never want to forget the vital question, why does he do something?

01:47:02.869 --> 01:47:08.869
The answer is because of his love, and we help our Bible student to see that.

01:47:08.869 --> 01:47:13.869
You see, Jehovah's power enables him to do things.

01:47:13.869 --> 01:47:20.869
His wisdom helps him and guides him along with justice to do things the right way.

01:47:20.869 --> 01:47:24.869
But what is it that motivates Jehovah?

01:47:24.869 --> 01:47:26.869
It's his love, isn't it?

01:47:26.869 --> 01:47:32.869
And asking the question, why Jehovah does things helps to highlight that point?

01:47:32.869 --> 01:47:39.869
So as we're teaching our Bible students, we need them to see that Jehovah really does love them,

01:47:39.869 --> 01:47:43.869
and he wants them to succeed in their life.

01:47:43.869 --> 01:47:49.869
Also, we could perhaps share with them some of the times that we personally have experienced Jehovah's love,

01:47:49.869 --> 01:47:53.869
perhaps in the way that Jehovah has answered our prayers.

01:47:53.869 --> 01:47:58.869
But in connection with this, there's another scripture that can help us.

01:47:58.869 --> 01:48:02.869
If you turn with me, please, to the book of Isaiah.

01:48:02.869 --> 01:48:10.869
Isaiah chapter 48, and we're going to look at verses 17 and 18.

01:48:10.869 --> 01:48:15.869
Isaiah 48, 17 and 18.

01:48:15.869 --> 01:48:21.869
This is what Jehovah says, your repurchaser, the Holy One of Israel.

01:48:21.869 --> 01:48:31.869
I, Jehovah, am your God, the one teaching you to benefit yourself, the one guiding you in the way you should walk.

01:48:31.869 --> 01:48:38.869
If only you would pay attention to my commandments, then your peace would become just like a river

01:48:38.869 --> 01:48:43.869
and your righteousness by the waves of the sea.

01:48:43.869 --> 01:48:46.869
Do you see the point that's being made here?

01:48:46.869 --> 01:48:52.869
We need to help the Bible student to understand that Jehovah really wants the best for them,

01:48:52.869 --> 01:48:57.869
and he's helping and guiding them in the way that they should go.

01:48:57.869 --> 01:49:04.869
And the end result, we notice there in verse 18, is that peace and righteousness will be their reward.

01:49:04.869 --> 01:49:09.869
Well, this truly is something that can help the Bible student.

01:49:09.869 --> 01:49:14.869
In fact, when they start to face the changes that they need to make in life,

01:49:14.869 --> 01:49:22.869
if they have this love for Jehovah, they won't just view it as something they have to do in order to attain everlasting life.

01:49:22.869 --> 01:49:32.439
No, they'll view these things as opportunities for them to prove their love of Jehovah.

01:49:32.439 --> 01:49:36.439
Well, what is this symposium, Sean?

01:49:36.439 --> 01:49:40.439
As we've listened to the various talks and watched the videos,

01:49:40.439 --> 01:49:46.439
it's helped us to see various ways that we can help our Bible students to make progress.

01:49:46.439 --> 01:49:52.439
We realize that conducting a Bible study and helping someone to become a disciple

01:49:52.439 --> 01:49:58.439
is not just a matter of reading certain paragraphs in a book or using certain techniques.

01:49:58.439 --> 01:50:01.439
A lot more is involved.

01:50:01.439 --> 01:50:03.439
What else?

01:50:03.439 --> 01:50:07.439
Remember, the Apostle Paul was an experienced disciple maker.

01:50:07.439 --> 01:50:11.439
And let's turn our Bibles to the first book of Thessalonians.

01:50:11.439 --> 01:50:18.439
And we'll notice here under inspiration, the Apostle Paul tells us what else is involved.

01:50:18.439 --> 01:50:24.439
Verse Thessalonians chapter 2, and we're going to read verses 7 and 8.

01:50:24.439 --> 01:50:29.439
On the contrary, we became gentle in your midst,

01:50:29.439 --> 01:50:33.439
as when a nursing mother tenderly cares for her own children.

01:50:33.439 --> 01:50:41.439
So having tender affection for you, we were determined to impart to you not only the good news of God,

01:50:41.439 --> 01:50:48.439
but also our very selves because you became so beloved to us.

01:50:48.439 --> 01:50:53.439
Yes, we really need to care for these ones.

01:50:53.439 --> 01:50:59.439
We need to nurture them, help them with the problems and obstacles they face along the way.

01:50:59.439 --> 01:51:04.439
And yes, we need to become their friends.

01:51:04.439 --> 01:51:10.439
Well, becoming a disciple maker is a challenging work. There's a lot involved with it.

01:51:10.439 --> 01:51:18.439
But don't feel overwhelmed. You can do it with your harvest help and the help of Jesus Christ.

01:51:18.439 --> 01:51:24.439
Remember when Jesus gave us a commission to go and make disciples, what else did He say?

01:51:24.439 --> 01:51:27.439
Look, I am with you.

01:51:27.439 --> 01:51:33.439
Yes, with Jehovah's help and with the help of Jesus, we can experience a wonderful joy.

01:51:33.439 --> 01:51:40.439
What is that joy? The joy of seeing a new disciple learn to love Jehovah.

01:51:40.439 --> 01:51:47.880
Thank you, brothers, for helping us to become more effective Bible teachers.

01:51:47.880 --> 01:51:54.880
Soon, we will enjoy part one of our Bible drama based on the account of Nehemiah.

01:51:54.880 --> 01:52:03.880
To wet our appetite, let us stand and sing song number 110 entitled The Joy of Jehovah.

01:52:03.880 --> 01:52:11.880
After the song, you may remain standing for some announcements, that song number 110.
