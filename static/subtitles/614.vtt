WEBVTT

00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.559
You are what you eat.

00:00:04.559 --> 00:00:06.519
We all know that familiar saying.

00:00:06.519 --> 00:00:09.960
It refers to things that we may choose to eat.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.880
Well, it could be junk food or it could be healthy food.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.839
Our choices can impact us physically,

00:00:16.839 --> 00:00:19.320
as well as spiritually.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.480
So if you are what you eat, you are what you see

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.399
and what you hear.

00:00:25.399 --> 00:00:29.079
And that's especially true when it comes to entertainment.

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:30.800
We're reminded that each day

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.280
we have a choice to make when we wake up.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.119
Will we partake of the table of Jehovah?

00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:39.320
Or the table of demons?

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.920
We're free to choose.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.560
But our choices have consequences.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:49.079
They can draw us closer to Jehovah or could distance us.

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.159
Most today choose the table of the demons

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:56.240
and the consequences are plain to see.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.520
Their actions reflect what's on the menu

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.200
of the table of demons.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.959
And that is the works of the flesh listed at Galatians 5.

00:01:05.959 --> 00:01:10.640
In contrast, we who are tied in and millions around the world

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.640
have chosen to eat at the table of Jehovah.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.040
And the actions and the consequences are evident as well.

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.840
What's on Jehovah's menu?

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.079
Well, it's the fruitage of the Spirit.

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:24.239
It's very evident.

00:01:24.239 --> 00:01:26.959
We love eating from Jehovah's table.

00:01:26.959 --> 00:01:29.640
It's delicious and it's nutritious.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.000
We all can attest to that.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.280
It's interesting that a sister sent a letter of appreciation

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.480
to the governing body about spiritual food.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.560
This is what she said.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.359
Thank you for spoiling us with such a banquet

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:47.079
of rich, rich dishes that is constantly set before us.

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:49.799
As we indulge in such feasting, we

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.640
can say that our spiritual bellies are bulging

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.920
because you have wholeheartedly fulfilled your commission

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:58.719
to feed Jehovah's sheep.

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:00.239
So I think we can all agree.

00:02:00.239 --> 00:02:02.359
We have so much food that we're getting.

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:03.480
We are full.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:04.879
We're not talking to physical belly.

00:02:04.879 --> 00:02:06.760
We're talking to the spiritual belly here.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.159
We appreciate the governing body, blessing us

00:02:09.159 --> 00:02:11.439
with all this food.

00:02:11.439 --> 00:02:14.080
Now, because of the pandemic, of course,

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.879
we're at home now more than ever.

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:20.479
And perhaps we're alone at times, which brings up

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:24.719
many challenges and temptations about choosing

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:27.000
the right kind of entertainment that will

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.360
draw us closer to Jehovah.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.560
Now, Satan knows we're alone.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.000
He knows that sometimes we're lonely.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.719
So he may feel we're more vulnerable or open to temptation

00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:41.319
to partake of the table of demons.

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:42.719
Just a nibble.

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:43.960
Just a snack.

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.159
Will it really hurt?

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:48.879
You might remember this Watchtower quote.

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:51.599
It says, Satan does not mind if part of our heart

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:53.360
is loving what is right.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.360
As long as part of it loves what is bad, what he promotes,

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.280
he wants you to eat at both tables,

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.759
knowing that it could distance you from Jehovah.

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:09.120
So is it possible to eat at both tables?

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.800
What's the harm?

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.919
Well, let's read today's scriptural text

00:03:12.919 --> 00:03:17.360
at 1 Corinthians 10 and verse 21.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.039
As we recall, it says, you cannot be drinking the cup

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:25.080
of Jehovah and the cup of demons.

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.639
You cannot be partaking of the table of Jehovah

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:32.159
and the table of demons.

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:35.719
So is it possible to eat at both tables?

00:03:35.719 --> 00:03:40.719
Actually, yes, but they're in lies the problem.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.759
You can do it, but what are the consequences?

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:46.039
Some live a double life.

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:48.000
They try to eat at both tables.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.280
How does Jehovah feel about that?

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.280
Notice verse 22, it indicates that if we were to do so,

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:59.319
we would be inciting Jehovah to jealousy.

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:03.039
And we know he requires exclusive devotion.

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:07.560
He wants his to feed exclusively at his table.

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:12.639
However, we might rationalize if my main diet

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:15.599
is at Jehovah's table and once in a while I nibble

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:19.480
or snack at the table of demons, what's the harm?

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:20.920
I've been in the truth for years.

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:24.120
I've been at Bethel for quite a few years.

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.600
Maybe I'm a commuter, a remote worker, LDC.

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:28.600
I can handle it.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.839
I'm mature, really?

00:04:31.839 --> 00:04:33.240
What does verse 12 say?

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:38.759
It says, so let the one who thinks he is standing,

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:43.759
so spiritual, beware that he does not fall.

00:04:43.959 --> 00:04:46.519
No temptation has come upon you,

00:04:46.519 --> 00:04:49.279
except what is common to man.

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:55.519
Exclusive devotion includes every aspect of our life.

00:04:55.519 --> 00:05:00.160
No exceptions, Paul reminds us of what Jehovah requires

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.279
of all those who have dedicated their lives to him.

00:05:03.279 --> 00:05:08.149
Notice verse 31, it says whether you are eating

00:05:08.149 --> 00:05:10.709
or drinking or doing anything else,

00:05:10.709 --> 00:05:15.709
including entertainment, do all things for God's glory.

00:05:16.709 --> 00:05:20.709
That's our goal, but Satan's goal is quite the opposite.

00:05:20.709 --> 00:05:24.709
There are many Bible examples that we can look to

00:05:24.709 --> 00:05:27.709
that really set a sterling example for us.

00:05:27.709 --> 00:05:30.709
King David was one who always wanted to give

00:05:30.709 --> 00:05:34.709
Jehovah exclusive devotion to do all things for God's glory.

00:05:34.709 --> 00:05:38.709
In fact, open your Bible to Psalm 101,

00:05:38.709 --> 00:05:42.709
and we're going to quickly read verses 1 through 8.

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:45.990
It's interesting, as we read his words,

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:50.990
we see the determination in his service to Jehovah,

00:05:51.269 --> 00:05:54.550
what he will do and what he refuses to do.

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:59.709
In fact, he says, I will 11 times showing he was quite determined

00:05:59.709 --> 00:06:03.189
in his what he would allow into his house or the associates

00:06:03.189 --> 00:06:05.189
that he would allow into his company.

00:06:05.189 --> 00:06:08.949
Notice there in Psalm 101, verse 1, he says,

00:06:08.949 --> 00:06:12.870
I will sing about your loyal love and justice.

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:16.670
To you, O Jehovah, I will sing praises.

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:19.230
Yes, praising Jehovah, serving him,

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:22.990
giving him exclusive devotion was the number one thing

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:24.550
in David's life.

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:27.029
It impacted all of his choices that he made,

00:06:27.029 --> 00:06:31.230
what he thought about, what he said, what he did.

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:34.310
This led to actions, notice verse 2,

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:39.310
says, I will act with discretion and blamelessness.

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:42.509
And then he asked the question, when will you come to me?

00:06:42.509 --> 00:06:46.110
He was always concerned about his closeness to Jehovah.

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:51.110
He said, I will walk with integrity of heart inside my house.

00:06:51.949 --> 00:06:55.149
So it didn't matter if David was with others

00:06:55.149 --> 00:06:59.670
or if he was alone in his house where no one could see him.

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:03.029
He was determined to keep his integrity,

00:07:03.029 --> 00:07:08.029
his whole hearted love and unbreakable devotion to Jehovah.

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:14.350
Like David, we must be determined to walk with integrity

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:18.110
inside our house, inside our Bethel room

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:23.110
where others may not see us, but knowing Jehovah can.

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:28.089
Integrity is like a fire wall.

00:07:28.089 --> 00:07:31.769
A fire wall is a wall within our home or office building

00:07:31.769 --> 00:07:35.769
that does not allow fire to spread from one room to the other.

00:07:35.769 --> 00:07:38.170
It protects us from danger.

00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:40.470
Well, another type of firewall is used

00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:43.970
on computer security systems to prevent hackers

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:48.970
and viruses from infecting networks or computers.

00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:53.970
Well, in the same way, we must build our own personal firewall

00:07:54.009 --> 00:07:56.810
that is with our Bible-trained conscience,

00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:59.170
not allowing bad things into our life,

00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:01.370
only the good things from Jehovah

00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:04.009
and making sure that these harmful influences

00:08:04.009 --> 00:08:07.769
like immorality, violence and spiritism

00:08:07.769 --> 00:08:11.410
has nothing to do with us because we know Jehovah hates these.

00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:14.889
As we read verses three through eight,

00:08:14.889 --> 00:08:17.810
it's almost like the menu for what's on the entertainment

00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:19.850
and the demons' table.

00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:23.050
And we can almost imagine that if David was alive today

00:08:23.050 --> 00:08:26.970
and he had a remote control, TV remote control in his hand

00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:29.370
or a mouse and he was clicking through the internet,

00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:31.209
how he would view a lot of the things

00:08:31.209 --> 00:08:33.490
that we have access today.

00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:35.809
Notice verse three, he says,

00:08:35.809 --> 00:08:40.009
I will not set anything worthless or good for nothing

00:08:40.009 --> 00:08:41.649
before my eyes.

00:08:41.649 --> 00:08:45.490
I hate the deeds of those who deviate from what is right.

00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:48.690
I will have nothing to do with them.

00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:50.970
A crooked heart is far from me.

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:54.210
I will not accept what is bad.

00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:56.570
Anyone slandering his neighbor and secret,

00:08:56.570 --> 00:08:58.330
I will silence.

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:02.289
So change the station, exit the website, turn it off.

00:09:03.129 --> 00:09:06.370
Anyone with haughty eyes or arrogant heart,

00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:07.809
I will not tolerate.

00:09:08.889 --> 00:09:12.490
I will look to the faithful ones of the earth

00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:14.610
so that they may dwell with me.

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:17.730
The one walking in blamelessness or integrity

00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:19.129
will minister to me.

00:09:19.129 --> 00:09:23.769
So blocking out what is bad but allowing the good in.

00:09:23.769 --> 00:09:27.169
Seven, no deceitful person will dwell in my house

00:09:27.169 --> 00:09:31.490
and no liar will stand in my presence or in front of my eyes.

00:09:32.529 --> 00:09:35.690
Every morning, I will silence.

00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:39.570
Change the station, exit the website, turn it off,

00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:41.490
all the wicked of the earth

00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:45.929
to cut off all wrongdoers from the city of Jehovah.

00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:50.090
So again, David as well as us and all loyal ones

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:53.929
have a choice every day, what we will eat,

00:09:53.929 --> 00:09:57.929
where we will eat, who we will eat with.

00:09:57.929 --> 00:10:02.929
Our choices have consequences both physically and spiritually.

00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:06.769
They can draw as close to Jehovah or they could distance us.

00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:11.690
A recent watchtower encouraged us to ask ourselves,

00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:15.370
will my choice of entertainment make it seem

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:17.250
that I'm hypocritical?

00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:19.409
If my Bible students or return visits

00:10:19.409 --> 00:10:21.809
saw the entertainment I choose,

00:10:21.809 --> 00:10:24.889
would they think that I practice what I preach?

00:10:25.929 --> 00:10:27.730
We will make wise choices

00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:31.330
if we apply the counsel in Romans 12 and verse 9

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:36.169
to always let our love for God be without hypocrisy.

00:10:36.169 --> 00:10:39.169
So remember, you are what you eat.

00:10:39.169 --> 00:10:43.690
So continue to eat and partake exclusively of Jehovah's table

00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:46.289
so we can give him exclusive devotion

00:10:46.289 --> 00:10:48.809
and do all things for God's glory.
