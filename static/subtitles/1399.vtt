00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:12.779
It's fine.

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:16.129
This is mine.

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:17.210
My tree.

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:18.210
Oh, brilliant.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.210
Thanks.

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:21.089
I didn't have any breakfast.

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:25.570
So, we left off at paragraph 10.

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.329
Listen, I don't have it in me today.

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:34.289
I got like two hours sleep.

00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:35.649
You are right.

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:38.289
Just super stressed.

00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:41.340
I can't focus.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.329
I'm really sorry.

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:48.929
My boyfriend, school, work,

00:00:48.929 --> 00:00:51.009
everything else.

00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:53.250
I just don't even have time to breathe.

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.090
When my schedule gets a bit crazy,

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.530
I focus on organizing what I can.

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.670
How about that?

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.750
I give everything a proper place.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.230
Yeah, I'm not really the organization type.

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:10.230
But I can help.

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.989
I mean, if you want.

00:01:13.989 --> 00:01:16.189
I guess a little help couldn't hurt.

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:20.390
So, how organized is your place right now?

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.040
OK.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:33.219
Well, where should we start?

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:34.260
You're the neat freak.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:35.819
You tell me.

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:37.260
Let's try and find the bed.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:38.459
We'll work from there.
