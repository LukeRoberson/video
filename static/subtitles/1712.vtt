00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:09.380
As a child, I dreamed of becoming a ballerina.

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:12.380
I trained as a ballet dancer from childhood.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.379
I was taught to give complete obedience to the artistic director,

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.379
absolute loyalty to the dance company,

00:00:19.379 --> 00:00:23.379
and to put ballet before everything else in my life.

00:00:23.379 --> 00:00:28.910
I finally realized there's no way to get ahead in this world

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.910
without compromise.

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:33.909
It just can't be done.

00:00:33.909 --> 00:00:36.909
Such a life is empty and unsatisfying.

00:00:36.909 --> 00:00:44.679
Problem is, once you get into that,

00:00:44.679 --> 00:00:48.679
because you get lulled in by that glamour and glitz,

00:00:48.679 --> 00:00:52.679
now down the road when you finally see the trap

00:00:52.679 --> 00:00:55.679
and what you got into, it's very hard to get out.

00:00:55.679 --> 00:00:58.679
And I always tell young people,

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:00.679
you know, it doesn't matter how good everything seems,

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:06.680
it doesn't matter how great there's always a string attached, always.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.680
And then one day, you're going to wake up and it's a rope.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.680
And you can't cut a rope that easily.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.680
Meaning you can't get out of this situation once Satan has you trapped in it.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.680
And it happens without you even realizing it.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.680
Ballet is discipline.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.680
And I had to figure out a way to take that skill

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.680
and transfer it into my everyday life.

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.680
Took some time, but I finally figured it out,

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.680
because it's not a waste, it's good.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.680
But what I had to learn was to get out of my comfort zone.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.120
We were in Bethel until 1987.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.120
Jack had a job lined up when we left Bethel,

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:49.120
and that was good.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:54.120
I couldn't get a job because of my physical health issues.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.120
So I probably was in bed about five months.

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.120
Eventually, I started feeling better,

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.120
and that's when I realized how bad the medical bills were getting.

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:08.120
I just dragged myself out of bed and went and looked for a part-time job.

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.120
Obviously, through all of this,

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:13.120
Jack and I just kept praying we knew Jehovah would take care of us.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.120
No question about that.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.120
Eventually, I did get a job.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.120
At a law firm, it was a good job.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.120
I actually lasted there 30 years.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.120
Absolutely, Jehovah blessed me.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.120
And I believe what he was blessing were my efforts.

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.120
I didn't quit, and I refused to compromise.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.120
When I started seeing that I was really learning this new skill

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.120
and I was getting good at it,

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.120
that's when I sat down in a civil Jehovah.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.120
I have this new skill.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.120
I want to be able to use it for you.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.120
One thing led to another,

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.120
and I became a commuter Bethelite for the legal department.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.120
I'd say about 11 years after I had left Bethel,

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.120
I was working all of a sudden.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.120
I got sick again.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.120
Same thing.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.120
Complete rapid loss of weight.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.120
All the weakness came back.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.120
I was eventually diagnosed as having celiac disease.

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.120
So once I changed my diet, I just started getting better or better.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.120
I stayed with the law firm until 2014,

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.120
and then my husband and I retired and moved to another part of the country.

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.120
And now, currently, I'm a remote Bethel consultant.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.120
Slave for the world really are a slave.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.120
If you slave for Jehovah, in my opinion,

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.120
you're not slaving at all.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.120
You couldn't have a better partnership than you and Jehovah.

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.120
And that's how I view it.

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.120
And you're never going to experience Jehovah to the full,

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.120
unless you put yourself out there for him to use.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:47.120
I've had a wonderful life of extraordinary spiritual privileges.

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.120
There's no career in the world that is ever going to come close to that.
