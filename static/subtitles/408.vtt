00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:07.910
This morning, we're talking about that clever strategy of Satan designed to lure people

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:10.550
away from Jehovah God.

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:14.910
And so we're going to examine two approaches.

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:24.030
One he used with the youngest intelligent creature in the universe, and the other he used

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:28.350
on the oldest intelligent creature in the universe.

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.630
So let's take the youngest first course that was Eve.

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:40.630
So taking advantage of her inexperience, his purpose was to trick this woman and to seduce

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:41.630
her.

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:43.229
Now, how would he do it?

00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:46.229
Well, as we know, he was behind a serpent.

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:51.950
He didn't want to show her who he really was, what his aim really was.

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:57.469
His choice of words also revealed a lot in our text is Genesis chapter 3.

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:05.390
Let's go there, if you would, to like to just read his question again, Genesis chapter

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:15.430
3 verse 1, did God really say that you must not eat from every tree of the garden?

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.750
Now what was his motive in asking this question?

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:26.549
Well, as was stated in one of the commenters, what he was trying to do was to see a doubt

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:32.629
in her mind, implying that Jehovah God was holding something back from her.

00:01:32.629 --> 00:01:36.069
He was too restrictive on you.

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:40.069
Well, it's interesting concerning questions.

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:45.829
The BE book, Benefit from Theocratic Ministry of School Education on page 66 says,

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:49.750
some questions are like icebergs.

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:55.390
The most substantial part lies hidden beneath the surface, an underlying issue is often

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.670
more important than the question itself.

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:07.829
And in the case of Eve, when the question was asked, she didn't see the underlying purpose

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.430
of the question.

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:17.270
Her answer in verses 2 and 3 indicate this, she said, we made of the fruit of the trees

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:18.710
of the garden.

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:22.750
But God has said about the fruit of the tree that is in the middle of the garden, you

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:29.229
must not eat from it, no, you must not touch it, otherwise you will die.

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:34.550
Her answer was truthful, and it was an honest, innocent answer.

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:40.310
But Satan had her exactly where he wanted her.

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:49.710
You see, he was banking on her self-interest that she would be more interested in herself,

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:56.629
her own needs than she was the love she had for, the God that gave her everything that

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:58.469
she had.

00:02:58.469 --> 00:03:04.789
Read his words again in verses 4 and 5, Satan said, you certainly will not die.

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:08.830
For God knows, in the very day you eat from it, your eyes will be opened, and you'll

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.629
be like God, knowing good and bad.

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:17.150
Gradually, his gamble worked.

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:24.669
She had not cultivated the kind of love and appreciation for Jehovah God that she should

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:26.270
have.

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:28.349
So what can we learn from this example?

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:36.270
Well, if a perfect human can succumb to this kind of irrational reasoning, really, it

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:40.990
could happen to any of us, Jehovah God created us as free moral agents, that's the way

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.990
you made Eve.

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:44.550
He doesn't want robots.

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:50.789
He wants us to be able to think things through and make the right choices, decide between

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:52.550
right and wrong.

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:58.110
Satan is counting on us making the wrong choices.

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:02.830
Now what can we do to counter that attack from Satan?

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:07.870
Well we have to know what is in our hearts.

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:14.150
To go to Hebrews chapter 12, verses 15 and 16, the Apostle Paul gives a warning to his

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:21.910
fellow Christians against becoming people not appreciating sacred things, and that's

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:30.589
sort of the context of these verses 15 and 16, he says carefully watch that no one fails

00:04:30.589 --> 00:04:37.189
to obtain the undeserved kindness of God, so that no poisonous root springs up to cause

00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:43.310
trouble and many be defiled by it, and watch that among you there is no one who is sexually

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:49.829
immoral, nor anyone who does not appreciate sacred things.

00:04:49.829 --> 00:04:56.350
So there is a need, as he said here, to in verse 15, carefully watch, carefully watch

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:00.990
that no poisonous root will spring up and contaminate the congregation.

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:06.629
The expression poisonous root refers to a few that may be in a congregation who may find

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:09.550
fault with the way things are done.

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:16.110
Maybe even find fault with way Jehovah has, the direction Jehovah has given on matters.

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:20.790
Maybe the sacredness of marriage are the need for moral cleanness.

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:24.629
So we don't want to be those kind of people obviously.

00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:30.269
But tell me what's necessary before a root can appear?

00:05:30.269 --> 00:05:36.709
Well, a seed has to be planted, and then it germinates, and then it grows into a root.

00:05:36.709 --> 00:05:42.269
So it's at the seed level that we have to give special attention.

00:05:42.269 --> 00:05:48.350
We have to learn to identify these improper seeds as it were.

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:51.990
No one can do that for us because they can't read a heart.

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:57.430
The seed may even, we've never even voiced what the seed is, but it could be in our thinking

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:58.910
and in our heart.

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:08.629
And these internal weaknesses has to be addressed for fear we find ourselves in a circumstance

00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:16.949
maneuvered by Satan to accentuate that particular weakness.

00:06:16.949 --> 00:06:22.230
Now James chapter 114 and 15 really describes the process well.

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:31.110
James 114 and 15, where he says, each one's tried by being drawn out and enticed by his own

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:37.209
desire, own desire.

00:06:37.209 --> 00:06:44.189
Then the desire seed, when it has become fertile, starts to grow, gives birth to sin and

00:06:44.189 --> 00:06:49.370
turns sin when it has been carried out, brings forth death.

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:54.009
So being enticed by his own desire, does that sound familiar?

00:06:54.009 --> 00:06:55.970
It's a powerful force.

00:06:55.970 --> 00:07:02.930
It's one that happened to Eve, the self interests, they're similar.

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:05.250
So do we need, what do we need to do?

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:11.930
Well as we said earlier, identify the seed or a seed, if that may be the case.

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:18.129
Don't let them germinate, don't let them start to grow, rid ourselves of that thinking.

00:07:18.129 --> 00:07:24.050
And if a poisonous root may happen to be in us or starting to grow, then we need to rip

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:29.730
it out and you may need to have help to do it, it may be impossible to remove a poisonous

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:32.449
root by yourself.

00:07:32.449 --> 00:07:38.370
Now let's spend a few moments on the approach Satan used for the oldest intelligent creature

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:41.329
in the universe, of course Christ Jesus.

00:07:41.329 --> 00:07:47.129
Now in his case, he didn't try to hide himself, he realized there was no need to do that.

00:07:47.129 --> 00:07:49.089
Jesus knew exactly who he was.

00:07:49.089 --> 00:07:52.089
He understood the motive.

00:07:52.089 --> 00:07:59.410
And so he just went overtly right to Jesus, and as you know in the account of Matthew 4,

00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:04.250
he said, look, just fall down and do an act of worship to me.

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:08.089
So what does it tell us about Satan?

00:08:08.089 --> 00:08:16.329
Well, he has long been driven by jealousy over the worship that goes to Jehovah God.

00:08:16.329 --> 00:08:24.129
And he's going to go to any link possible to try to violate our worship to Jehovah God.

00:08:24.129 --> 00:08:30.089
He wants to pervert our worship to Jehovah God.

00:08:30.089 --> 00:08:39.730
And so if he has enough boldness to approach the Jesus Christ, then we know he will approach

00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:45.970
any one of us, and it makes no difference how strong spiritually we look on the outside,

00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:48.330
he will try to break our integrity.

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:55.929
Clearly the Bible reveals that Satan is a deadly strategist in seeking his aims.

00:08:55.929 --> 00:09:00.769
Happily though, we don't have to be like Eve because we know the designs of Satan the

00:09:00.769 --> 00:09:01.769
devil.

00:09:01.769 --> 00:09:06.649
May each of us cultivate the kind of love Jesus had for a Jehovah God.

00:09:06.649 --> 00:09:10.649
So we too can stand firm in our integrity.
