00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:11.699
Have you ever been the victim of oppression or injustice?

00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:15.699
Have you been angered by something someone has said or done?

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:17.699
Who of us hasn't?

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:25.699
In situations like that, people who don't know Jehovah often react in a way that's far from peaceful.

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:30.699
They retaliate, they fight, they hit back.

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:37.700
But we know that Jehovah sees what happened and he can set matters straight.

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.700
We're wise to remember the words of Jesus.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.700
Happy are the mild tempered.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.700
Happy are the peacemakers.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:57.700
The Bible describes a man who remained mild and peaceable in some extremely difficult and stressful situations.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:05.700
Repeatedly, he chose not to fight, preferring a course that led to peace.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.700
That man was Jacob.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.700
Jacob learned from the peaceful example of his father, Isaac.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:25.700
There was a famine in the land, and Isaac moved his family to Girard, which was ruled by Abimlech, king of the Philistines.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.700
Let's read about the problems that arose and see how Isaac dealt with them.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.700
Please turn to Genesis 26 and verse 12.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:49.239
And Isaac began to so seed in that land, and in that year he reaped 100 times what he sowed, for Jehovah was blessing him.

00:01:49.239 --> 00:01:56.239
The man became wealthy, and he continued to prosper until he became very wealthy.

00:01:56.239 --> 00:02:07.239
He acquired flocks of sheep and herds of cattle and a large body of servants, and the Philistines began to envy him.

00:02:07.239 --> 00:02:16.240
So the Philistines took soil and stopped up all the wells that his father's servants had dug in the days of Abraham.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.240
Abimlech then said to Isaac,

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:24.240
move from our neighborhood, for you have grown far stronger than we are.

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:32.240
So Isaac moved from there, and encamped in the valley of Girard, and began dwelling there.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:43.240
And Isaac again dug the wells that had been dug in the days of his father Abraham, but that the Philistines had stopped up after Abraham's death,

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:48.240
and he called them by the names that his father had given them.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:55.240
When the servants of Isaac were digging in the valley, they found a well of fresh water,

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:02.240
and the shepherds of Girard began quarreling with the shepherds of Isaac, saying,

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.240
the water is ours.

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:16.240
So he named the well Isaac, because they had quarreled with him, and they started digging another well, and they began quarreling over it also.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.240
So he named it Sitna.

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:25.240
Later he moved away from there and dug another well, but they did not quarrel over it.

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.240
So he named it Rahoboth, and said,

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:36.240
it is because now Jehovah has given us ample room and has made us fruitful in the land.

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.240
Then he went up from there to bear Shiba.

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.240
That night Jehovah appeared to him and said,

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.240
I am the God of your father Abraham.

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:59.240
Do not be afraid for I am with you, and I will bless you and multiply your offspring on account of Abraham my servant.

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:06.240
The Philistines, motivated by envy, stop up all the wells that Abraham had dug,

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:11.240
and the king asks Isaac to move from the neighborhood.

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:14.240
Isaac now has a decision to make.

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:18.240
Perhaps some encourage him to stay put.

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:21.240
Think about how they might have reasoned.

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:24.240
You have done nothing wrong, Isaac.

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:29.240
Jehovah told you that you and your offspring would possess the land.

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.240
You have nothing to fear.

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.240
You have many servants, and they are stronger than the Philistines.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:43.240
Why not hit back against those who have done this to your wells?

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:48.240
In this situation, what would you have done?

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.240
Isaac chooses a peaceful course.

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.240
He decides to move on.

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.240
This is not easy.

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:04.240
Isaac has many servants and flocks of sheep and herds of cattle.

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:11.240
He has tilled the ground, planted seed, and it is produced plentifully.

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:17.240
But he leaves that behind and moves on.

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.240
But Isaac's troubles are not over.

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:27.240
In his new location, his servants dig wells and find fresh water.

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:33.240
But the shepherds in that area say, the water is ours.

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.240
Isaac then digs another well.

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:40.240
But the local shepherds quarrel about that one too.

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:46.240
Again, instead of fighting over the matter, Isaac moves.

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:52.240
And finally, finds a place where he can reside in peace.

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:59.240
Jacob saw that his father's peaceful actions had a good effect.

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:04.240
He knew that Isaac had received Jehovah's blessing.

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.240
What's the lesson?

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:17.240
Parents never underestimate the powerful effect your good example can have on your children.

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:21.240
Jacob has a twin brother, Esau.

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:25.240
Of the two, Esau is born first.

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:34.240
But Jehovah foretells that contrary to custom, the older Esau will serve his younger brother.

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:39.240
Jehovah foresees what kind of personalities they'll develop.

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:45.240
And he knows that Esau will have little appreciation for spiritual matters.

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:54.240
This becomes evident when Esau exchanges his right as firstborn for a mere bowl of stew.

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:58.240
Sealing the matter with an oath.

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:01.240
But something more is involved.

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:10.240
In selling the birthright, he also gives up the right to receive a prophetic blessing from his father.

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:13.240
Years pass.

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:15.240
Isaac has grown old.

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:20.240
And he decides it's time to impart the blessing to his firstborn.

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:26.240
He may not know that Esau had sold his right as firstborn.

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:31.240
In any case, he tells Esau that he will bless him.

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:40.240
But asks him first to provide him with a tasty dish of fresh game from the field.

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:45.240
Rebecca, the twin's mother overhears this conversation.

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:52.240
And persuades Jacob to impersonate his twin brother while Esau is out hunting.

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:55.240
The plan is successful.

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:59.240
Isaac unwittingly blesses Jacob.

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:04.240
Esau at learning of this is furious.

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:11.240
Let's take up the account from Genesis chapter 27 and verse 41.

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:19.240
However, Esau harbored animosity against Jacob because of the blessing his father had given him.

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:22.240
And Esau kept saying in his heart,

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:27.240
The days of mourning for my father are getting closer.

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:32.240
After that, I am going to kill Jacob, my brother.

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:36.240
When the words of her older son Esau were told to Rebecca,

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:42.240
She at once sent for her younger son Jacob and said to him,

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:47.240
Look, your brother Esau is planning to take revenge by killing you.

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:53.240
Now my son, do as I say, get up and run away to my brother Leban at Hairan.

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:59.240
Dwell with him for a while until your brother's rage calms down.

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:06.240
Until your brother's anger towards you subsides and he forgets what you have done to him.

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:09.240
Then I will send for you from there.

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:14.240
Why should I lose both of you in one day?

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:18.240
After that, Rebecca kept saying to Isaac,

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:23.240
I am disgusted with my life because of the daughters of Hath.

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:28.240
If Jacob ever takes away from the daughters of Hath like these daughters of the land,

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:31.240
What good is my life?

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:37.240
So Isaac called Jacob and blessed him and commanded him, saying,

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:41.240
You must not take a wife from the daughters of Canaan.

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:46.240
Go away to Patan A. Ram, to the house of Bithuel, your mother's father,

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:52.240
And from there take for yourself a wife, from the daughters of Leban, your mother's brother.

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:58.240
God Almighty will bless you and make you fruitful and multiply you

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:02.240
And you will certainly become a congregation of peoples.

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:08.240
And He will give to you the blessing of Abraham, to you and to your offspring with you,

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:13.240
So that you may take possession of the land where you have been living as a foreigner,

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:16.240
Which God has given to Abraham.

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:19.240
So Isaac sent Jacob away.

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:25.240
And he departed for Patan A. Ram to Leban, the son of Bithuel, the Aramean,

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:30.240
the brother of Rebecca, the mother of Jacob and Esau.

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:37.240
Jacob's parents tell him to travel to his uncle, Leban, to find a wife.

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:42.240
Of course, the core issue is the problem with Esau.

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:44.240
Recall that earlier,

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:47.240
Isaac had a problem with the Philistines.

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:52.240
A problem that evidently could not be settled peacefully.

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:55.240
So what did Isaac do?

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:57.240
He moved on.

00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:01.240
Now Jacob faces a similar situation.

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:05.240
His brother is seething with anger.

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:08.240
So Jacob leaves.

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:12.240
It means leaving his home and his family.

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:17.240
It means making a long journey to a distant land.

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:21.240
Jacob could have chosen to stand his ground.

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:23.240
He owns the birthright.

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:26.240
He could argue the matter with his father and mother.

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:31.240
I am no child. I am 77 years old.

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:34.240
Jacob does none of those things.

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:36.240
The Bible simply says,

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:41.240
Jacob obeyed his father and his mother and departed.

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:44.240
What's the lesson?

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:50.240
When we face a situation that can't be settled peacefully,

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:55.240
we probably won't need to flee for our lives to a distant land.

00:11:55.240 --> 00:12:03.240
Sometimes, however, it is the course of wisdom to walk away from a situation.

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:07.240
Proverbs chapter 17 and verse 14 says,

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:12.240
Beginning a fight is like opening a floodgate.

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:18.240
Before the quarrel breaks out, take your leave.

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:21.240
While Jacob is on his way to his uncle,

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:25.240
Jehovah appears to Jacob in a dream

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:30.240
and assures him of his support and protection.

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:35.240
That does not mean that Jacob's troubles are over.

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:40.240
At the journey's end, he moves in with his uncle's household.

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:49.240
In time, a situation rises again that shows that Jacob is a man who loves peace.

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:55.240
Let's read about it from Genesis chapter 29 and verse 16.

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:59.940
Now Laban had two daughters.

00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:04.940
The name of the older was Leah and the name of the younger Rachel.

00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:08.940
But the eyes of Leah had no lustre,

00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:13.940
whereas Rachel had become a very attractive and beautiful woman.

00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:18.940
Jacob had fallen in love with Rachel, so he said,

00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:23.940
I am willing to serve you seven years for your younger daughter, Rachel.

00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:25.940
To this, Laban said,

00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:30.940
It is better for me to give her to you than to give her to another man,

00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:32.940
keep dwelling with me.

00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:36.940
And Jacob served seven years for Rachel.

00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:43.940
But in his eyes, they were like just a few days because of his love for her.

00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:46.940
Then Jacob said to Laban,

00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:52.940
Give over my wife because my days are up and let me have relations with her.

00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:58.940
With that, Laban gathered all the men of the place and made a feast.

00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:03.940
But during the evening, he resorted to taking his daughter Leah

00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:08.940
and bringing her to him that he might have relations with her.

00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:14.940
Laban also gave his female servant, Zilpa, to his daughter Leah as a servant.

00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:19.940
In the morning, Jacob saw that it was Leah.

00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:22.940
So he said to Laban,

00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:24.940
What have you done to me?

00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:27.940
Was it not for Rachel that I served you?

00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:29.940
Why have you tricked me?

00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:31.940
To this, Laban said,

00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:36.940
It is not our custom here to give the younger woman before the firstborn,

00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:39.940
Celebrate the week of this woman.

00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:46.940
After that, you will also be given this other woman in exchange for serving me seven more years.

00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:50.940
Jacob did so and celebrated the week of this woman,

00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:55.940
after which he gave him his daughter Rachel as a wife.

00:14:55.940 --> 00:15:04.279
Besides, Laban gave his female servant Bilha to his daughter Rachel as her servant.

00:15:04.279 --> 00:15:07.279
Jacob has reason to be upset.

00:15:07.279 --> 00:15:12.279
He had arranged with Laban to work seven years for Rachel.

00:15:12.279 --> 00:15:18.279
At the end of the seven years, a wedding feast is arranged.

00:15:18.279 --> 00:15:23.279
But the heavily veiled woman brought into him is not Rachel.

00:15:23.279 --> 00:15:25.279
It's Leah.

00:15:25.279 --> 00:15:30.279
Imagine how shocked Jacob must have been.

00:15:30.279 --> 00:15:33.279
Instead of admitting to his deceit,

00:15:33.279 --> 00:15:36.279
Laban gives an excuse.

00:15:36.279 --> 00:15:39.279
What thoughts come to Jacob's mind?

00:15:39.279 --> 00:15:44.279
Does he consider that Jehovah might be working out his promise

00:15:44.279 --> 00:15:47.279
to make Jacob's offspring plentiful?

00:15:47.279 --> 00:15:50.279
Like the dust particles of the earth?

00:15:50.279 --> 00:15:52.279
We don't know.

00:15:52.279 --> 00:15:55.279
As it turns out,

00:15:55.279 --> 00:16:01.279
Leah bears him six sons, including Levi and Judah,

00:16:01.279 --> 00:16:06.279
family heads of the two most honored tribes of Israel.

00:16:06.279 --> 00:16:10.279
Of course, Jacob couldn't have foreknown this.

00:16:10.279 --> 00:16:14.279
Still, Jacob, the peacemaker,

00:16:14.279 --> 00:16:20.279
accepts Leah and goes along with Laban's outrageous request

00:16:20.279 --> 00:16:25.279
that he work an additional seven years for Rachel.

00:16:25.279 --> 00:16:28.279
What's the lesson?

00:16:28.279 --> 00:16:33.279
It's disappointing when others don't hold to their agreements.

00:16:33.279 --> 00:16:35.279
Like Jacob.

00:16:35.279 --> 00:16:39.279
Can we find it in our hearts to forgive

00:16:39.279 --> 00:16:44.820
and find a way to preserve peace with them?

00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:49.820
Jacob serves Laban for 14 years for his two wives.

00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:55.820
And he works for Laban another six years for a flock of his own.

00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:58.820
Finally, at Jehovah's direction,

00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:02.820
he gathers his family along with his animals

00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:07.819
and without informing Laban, he leaves for home.

00:17:07.819 --> 00:17:12.819
When Laban learns of this, he is furious.

00:17:12.819 --> 00:17:16.819
He chases and catches up with Jacob.

00:17:16.819 --> 00:17:18.819
This is a dangerous situation.

00:17:18.819 --> 00:17:22.819
One that can easily turn violent.

00:17:22.819 --> 00:17:25.819
Imagine how it might have been.

00:17:25.819 --> 00:17:29.819
Jacob had come to a mountainous region.

00:17:29.819 --> 00:17:31.819
Possibly it's morning.

00:17:31.819 --> 00:17:33.819
And the air is cool.

00:17:33.819 --> 00:17:36.819
There are the sounds and smells of animals,

00:17:36.819 --> 00:17:39.819
sheep, donkeys, camels.

00:17:39.819 --> 00:17:41.819
There are many.

00:17:41.819 --> 00:17:44.819
The servants attend to them,

00:17:44.819 --> 00:17:48.819
getting them ready for the day's journey.

00:17:48.819 --> 00:17:51.819
But then come cries of alarm.

00:17:51.819 --> 00:17:53.819
Laban has come.

00:17:53.819 --> 00:17:55.819
And he's not alone.

00:17:55.819 --> 00:17:57.819
He arrives with strong men.

00:17:57.819 --> 00:18:00.819
They gallop in on camels.

00:18:00.819 --> 00:18:02.819
They dismount.

00:18:02.819 --> 00:18:06.819
This is not a friendly visit.

00:18:06.819 --> 00:18:10.819
Laban's men are ready to obey orders from Laban.

00:18:10.819 --> 00:18:14.819
Jacob's servants quickly gather to the scene.

00:18:14.819 --> 00:18:20.819
All eyes are fixed on Laban and Jacob who argue.

00:18:20.819 --> 00:18:24.819
The previous night, Jehovah had warned Laban in a dream

00:18:24.819 --> 00:18:28.819
to be careful about what he'd say to Jacob.

00:18:28.819 --> 00:18:34.819
Still, Laban is angry and aggressive.

00:18:34.819 --> 00:18:37.819
Laban makes two charges.

00:18:37.819 --> 00:18:39.819
First, he says,

00:18:39.819 --> 00:18:42.819
Why have you resorted to outwitting me

00:18:42.819 --> 00:18:47.819
and carrying my daughters off like captives taken by the sword?

00:18:47.819 --> 00:18:54.819
Why did you run away secretly and outwit me and not tell me?

00:18:54.819 --> 00:18:57.819
The answer to that charge is obvious.

00:18:57.819 --> 00:18:59.819
Jacob replies,

00:18:59.819 --> 00:19:02.819
It was because I was afraid.

00:19:02.819 --> 00:19:04.819
For I said to myself,

00:19:04.819 --> 00:19:08.819
You might take your daughters away from me by force.

00:19:08.819 --> 00:19:14.819
Laban also charges that Jacob has stolen his household gods.

00:19:14.819 --> 00:19:18.819
Rachel has indeed stolen the gods,

00:19:18.819 --> 00:19:21.819
but Jacob knows nothing about this.

00:19:21.819 --> 00:19:23.819
A search is made,

00:19:23.819 --> 00:19:26.819
but the idols are not found.

00:19:26.819 --> 00:19:29.819
Jacob then makes his defense.

00:19:29.819 --> 00:19:35.819
Let's take up our reading at Genesis chapter 31 and verse 36.

00:19:35.819 --> 00:19:43.420
At that, Jacob became angry and began to criticize Laban.

00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:46.420
Jacob then said to Laban,

00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:51.420
What is my offense and for what sin are you hotly pursuing me?

00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:54.420
Now that you have searched through all my goods,

00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:57.420
what have you found that belongs to your house?

00:19:57.420 --> 00:20:00.420
Put it here in front of my brothers and your brothers

00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:04.420
and let them decide between the two of us.

00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:07.420
During these 20 years that I have been with you,

00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:10.420
your sheep and your goats never miscarried,

00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:14.420
and I never ate the rams of your flock.

00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:18.420
I did not bring you any animal torn by wild beasts.

00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:21.420
I would stand the loss of it myself.

00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:24.420
Whether the animal was stolen by day,

00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:26.420
or was stolen by night,

00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:29.420
you would demand compensation from me.

00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:32.420
By day, the heap consumed me,

00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:36.420
and the cold by night and sleep would flee from my eyes.

00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:41.420
This makes 20 years for me in your house.

00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:44.420
I have served you 14 years for your two daughters,

00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:47.420
and six years for your flock,

00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:51.420
and you kept changing my wages 10 times.

00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:53.420
If the God of my Father,

00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:55.420
the God of Abraham,

00:20:55.420 --> 00:21:00.420
the one whom Isaac fears had not been on my side,

00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:04.420
you would now have sent me away empty handed.

00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:08.420
God has seen my affliction and the toil of my hands,

00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:11.420
and that is why he reproved you last night.

00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:14.420
Then, Laban answered Jacob.

00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:16.420
The daughters are my daughters,

00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:18.420
and the children, my children,

00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:20.420
and the flock, my flock,

00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:24.420
and everything you are looking at is mine.

00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:26.420
And my daughters,

00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:29.420
what can I do today against these

00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:33.420
or against their children whom they have born?

00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:37.420
Now come, let us make a covenant, you and I,

00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:40.420
and it will serve as a witness between us.

00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:45.420
So Jacob took a stone and set it up as a pillar.

00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:48.420
Then Jacob said to his brothers,

00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:50.420
pick up stones,

00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:53.420
and they took stones and made a pile.

00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:58.420
After that, they ate there on the pile of stones.

00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:02.420
And Laban began calling at Jigarse Hadootha,

00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:05.420
but Jacob called a galliad.

00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:07.420
Laban then said,

00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:12.420
this pile of stones is a witness between me and you today.

00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:15.420
That is why he named it galliad,

00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:18.420
and the watchtower, for he said,

00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:22.420
let Jehovah keep watch between you and me

00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:25.420
and we are out of each other's sight.

00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:28.420
If you mistreat my daughters,

00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:32.420
and if you start taking wives in addition to my daughters,

00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:34.420
though there is no man with us,

00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:39.420
remember that God will be a witness between you and me.

00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:42.420
Laban went on to say to Jacob,

00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:45.420
here is this pile of stones,

00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:49.420
and here is the pillar that I have erected between you and me.

00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:52.420
This pile of stones is a witness,

00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:55.420
and the pillar is something that bears witness,

00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:58.420
that I will not pass beyond this pile of stones

00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:00.420
to bring harm to you,

00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:03.420
and you will not pass beyond this pile of stones

00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:06.420
and this pillar to bring harm to me.

00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:09.420
Let the God of Abraham and the God of Nahor,

00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:14.420
the God of their Father, judge between us.

00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:19.420
You have to beware by the one whom his father Isaac fears.

00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:23.420
After that, Jacob offered a sacrifice in the mountain,

00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:26.420
and invited his brothers to eat bread,

00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:31.420
so they ate and spent the night in the mountain.

00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:34.420
However, Laban got up early in the morning

00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:39.420
and kissed his grandchildren and his daughters and blessed them.

00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:42.420
Then Laban departed and returned home.

00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:50.200
Jacob had served Laban faithfully for 20 years,

00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:54.200
even though Laban had defrauded and exploited him.

00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:57.200
Laban doesn't acknowledge that,

00:23:57.200 --> 00:24:01.200
but rather dishonestly claims that he is the rightful owner

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:04.200
of all that Jacob has with him.

00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:09.200
Laban then suggests that they make a covenant of peace,

00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:14.200
ensuring that neither family will bring harm to the other.

00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:18.200
Laban's motive is not that he loves peace.

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:22.200
It might have been to ensure that Jacob will not return

00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:25.200
with the household gods after Laban's death

00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:29.200
to deprive his sons of their inheritance.

00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:33.200
In any case, Jacob agrees.

00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:35.200
Everyone relaxes.

00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:38.200
There's to be no violence,

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:43.200
and a monument is set up to memorialize the agreement.

00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:47.200
Despite the many years of oppression,

00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:51.200
Jacob agrees to a covenant of peace.

00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:56.200
He does not harbor resentment or seek revenge.

00:24:56.200 --> 00:25:00.200
That crisis is over for Jacob.

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:04.200
But now, another one looms.

00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:07.200
Jacob sends messengers to his brother.

00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:11.200
They say that Jacob is returning

00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:14.200
and that he seeks Esau's favor.

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:17.200
The messengers return with the news

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:20.200
that Esau is on his way to meet him

00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:23.200
and with him are 400 men.

00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:25.200
Oh my!

00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:28.200
Is Esau still angry?

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:31.200
Understandably, Jacob is worried.

00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:35.200
He does not want to fight with his brother.

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:38.200
Let us see how he handles the situation.

00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:45.759
Please turn to Genesis chapter 32 and verse 13.

00:25:45.759 --> 00:25:48.759
And he spent the night there.

00:25:48.759 --> 00:25:50.759
Then he took some of his possessions

00:25:50.759 --> 00:25:54.759
as a gift for Esau his brother.

00:25:54.759 --> 00:25:57.759
200 female goats.

00:25:57.759 --> 00:25:59.759
20 male goats.

00:25:59.759 --> 00:26:01.759
200 female sheep.

00:26:01.759 --> 00:26:03.759
20 rams.

00:26:03.759 --> 00:26:06.759
30 camels nursing their young.

00:26:06.759 --> 00:26:08.759
40 cows.

00:26:08.759 --> 00:26:11.759
20 female dokeys.

00:26:11.759 --> 00:26:15.759
And 10 full grown male dokeys.

00:26:15.759 --> 00:26:18.759
He handed them over to his servants.

00:26:18.759 --> 00:26:20.759
One drove after another.

00:26:20.759 --> 00:26:23.759
And he said to his servants.

00:26:23.759 --> 00:26:25.759
Cross over ahead of me.

00:26:25.759 --> 00:26:27.759
And you were to set a space

00:26:27.759 --> 00:26:30.759
between one drove and the next.

00:26:30.759 --> 00:26:33.759
He also commanded the first one.

00:26:33.759 --> 00:26:36.759
In case Esau my brother should meet you

00:26:36.759 --> 00:26:39.759
and ask to whom do you belong?

00:26:39.759 --> 00:26:41.759
And where are you going?

00:26:41.759 --> 00:26:44.759
And to whom do these ahead of you belong?

00:26:44.759 --> 00:26:46.759
Then you should say,

00:26:46.759 --> 00:26:48.759
to your servant Jacob.

00:26:48.759 --> 00:26:50.759
It is a gift sent to my Lord.

00:26:50.759 --> 00:26:51.759
To Esau.

00:26:51.759 --> 00:26:55.759
And look, he himself is also behind us.

00:26:55.759 --> 00:26:58.759
And he commanded also the second,

00:26:58.759 --> 00:27:02.759
the third, and all those following the drools.

00:27:02.759 --> 00:27:06.759
To this word, you are to speak to Esau when you meet him.

00:27:06.759 --> 00:27:09.759
And you should also say,

00:27:09.759 --> 00:27:13.759
here is your servant Jacob behind us.

00:27:13.759 --> 00:27:15.759
For he said to himself,

00:27:15.759 --> 00:27:20.759
if I appease him by sending a gift ahead of me,

00:27:20.759 --> 00:27:23.759
then afterward when I see him,

00:27:23.759 --> 00:27:28.420
he may give me a kindly reception.

00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:32.420
Jacob wants peaceful relations with his brother.

00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:35.420
He sends a generous gift,

00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:39.420
hundreds of animals to help make that possible.

00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:41.420
Was Jacob weak-minded?

00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:44.420
Too cowardly to stand up to his brother?

00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:46.420
Not at all.

00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:49.420
Why, as the time neared for the meeting with Esau,

00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:52.420
Jacob wrestles with an angel until dawn

00:27:52.420 --> 00:27:57.420
to receive further assurance of Jehovah's blessing.

00:27:57.420 --> 00:28:01.420
Let's now see what happens when the two brothers meet.

00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:08.500
Please turn to Genesis chapter 33 and verse 1.

00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:13.500
Now Jacob raised his eyes and saw Esau coming.

00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:17.500
And 400 men were with him.

00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:21.500
So he divided the children among Leah, Rachel,

00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:24.500
and the two female servants.

00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:28.500
He put the female servants and their children in front.

00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:31.500
Leah and her children after them.

00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:34.500
And Rachel and Joseph behind them.

00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:37.500
Then he himself went ahead of them

00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:41.500
and bowed down to the earth seven times

00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:44.500
as he came near to his brother.

00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:47.500
But Esau ran to meet him,

00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:50.500
and he embraced him and kissed him.

00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:53.500
And they burst into tears.

00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:58.500
When he raised his eyes and saw the women and the children,

00:28:58.500 --> 00:28:59.500
he said,

00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:01.500
Who are these with you?

00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:03.500
To which he said,

00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:07.500
The children with whom God has favored your servant.

00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:12.500
At that, the female servants came forward with their children

00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:14.500
and bowed down.

00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:19.500
And Leah too came forward with her children and they bowed down.

00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:25.500
Then Joseph came forward with Rachel and they bowed down.

00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:27.500
Esau said,

00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:31.500
What is the purpose of all this camp of travelers that I have met?

00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:36.500
He replied in order to find favor in the eyes of my Lord.

00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:38.500
Then Esau said,

00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:42.500
I have a great many possessions, my brother.

00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:45.500
Keep what is yours.

00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:47.500
However, Jacob said,

00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:50.500
No, please.

00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:53.500
If I have found favor in your eyes,

00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:56.500
you must take my gift from my hand.

00:29:56.500 --> 00:30:01.500
Because I brought it so that I could see your face.

00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:04.500
And I have seen your face

00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:07.500
as though seeing God's face

00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:10.500
in that you received me with pleasure.

00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:12.500
Take, please,

00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:16.500
the gift conveying my blessing that was brought to you.

00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:19.500
For God has favored me.

00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:23.500
And I have everything I need.

00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:30.390
And he continued to urge him so that he took it.

00:30:30.390 --> 00:30:33.390
What a happy outcome.

00:30:33.390 --> 00:30:36.390
Instead of an angry confrontation,

00:30:36.390 --> 00:30:39.390
there is a joyful reunion.

00:30:39.390 --> 00:30:41.390
The two men shed tears.

00:30:41.390 --> 00:30:44.390
They embrace again.

00:30:44.390 --> 00:30:47.390
Jacob is the peacemaker.

00:30:47.390 --> 00:30:49.390
How did he prove that?

00:30:49.390 --> 00:30:51.390
He prayed.

00:30:51.390 --> 00:30:54.390
And he acted in harmony with his prayers.

00:30:54.390 --> 00:30:56.390
And gifts.

00:30:56.390 --> 00:30:59.390
He showed honor and respect to his brother,

00:30:59.390 --> 00:31:01.390
calling him Lord,

00:31:01.390 --> 00:31:04.390
and bowing seven times.

00:31:04.390 --> 00:31:06.390
What's the lesson?

00:31:06.390 --> 00:31:09.390
Doesn't this account well illustrate

00:31:09.390 --> 00:31:12.390
the extent to which we should be willing to go

00:31:12.390 --> 00:31:17.900
to preserve peace with our Christian brothers and sisters?

00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:22.900
We learn so much about seeking peace from Jacob.

00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:25.900
Threatened by his brother while living at home,

00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:27.900
he moved away.

00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:31.900
When deceived by Laban regarding Rachel and Leah,

00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:33.900
he yielded.

00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:37.900
When chased down and accused by Laban,

00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:40.900
Jacob agreed to a covenant of peace.

00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:43.900
And when confronting Esau,

00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:45.900
he offered a gift.

00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:47.900
Keep in mind,

00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:50.900
in none of these situations was Jacob the one

00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:52.900
who apologized,

00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:54.900
yet throughout his life,

00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:57.900
Jacob loved peace.

00:31:57.900 --> 00:32:00.900
He relied on Jehovah

00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:03.900
and Jehovah blessed him.

00:32:03.900 --> 00:32:06.900
Jehovah never forgot Jacob

00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:09.900
and how he pursued peace

00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:11.900
in his dealings with others.

00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:13.900
When we do the same,

00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:16.900
when we pursue peace

00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:18.900
in the face of injustice,

00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:20.900
in the face of persecution,

00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:22.900
in small issues,

00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:24.900
as well as in big issues,

00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:27.900
Jehovah will not forget us either.

00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:30.900
Jehovah will richly bless us

00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:32.900
if we love peace

00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:36.900
just as Jacob loved peace.
