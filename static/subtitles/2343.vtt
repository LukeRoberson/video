00:00:10.539 --> 00:00:19.539
Toward the end of his life, Joshua assembled all the tribes of Israel and gave a moving farewell speech.

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:24.539
In it, he recounted how Jehovah protected them.

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:32.539
Listen to his conclusion as recorded at Joshua 24, 14, and 15.

00:00:32.539 --> 00:00:47.539
Therefore fear Jehovah and serve him with integrity and faithfulness, and remove the gods that your forefathers served on the other side of the river and in Egypt, and serve Jehovah.

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:59.539
Now, if it seems bad to you to serve Jehovah, choose for yourselves today whom you will serve, whether the gods that your forefathers served on the other side of the river,

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:10.540
or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you are dwelling, but as for me and my household, we will serve Jehovah.

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.540
Did Joshua motivate his listeners?

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.540
Verse 16 says,

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:26.540
At this, the people answered, it is unthinkable for us to abandon Jehovah and to serve other gods.

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:39.540
Verse 31 adds that Israel continued to serve Jehovah all the days of Joshua and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:46.540
This teaches us something about how we can conclude a discussion effectively.

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.540
Our final words should connect to the overall topic.

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.540
Motivate our listeners and be simple and brief.

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:01.540
Let's watch the following conclusion of a public talk.

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:15.539
So, brothers, during these critical times hard to deal with, let's follow the council in today's talk, because with Jehovah's help, we can endure life's challenges, and when he brings an end to this world and all its problems will survive to live forever in a beautiful paradise.

00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:22.539
What do you think? Did the speaker connect his conclusion to the overall topic?

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:28.539
Could you identify the theme of his talk from this conclusion?

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:42.539
And while it's good that the speaker tried to motivate his audience, was he specific? Did he speak with a note of finality? Let's give him another chance.

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:50.539
So, brothers, although we live in times of distress, may we always remember how Jehovah helps us.

00:02:50.539 --> 00:03:00.539
He offers us his powerful Holy Spirit. He provides support through our loving Christian brotherhood, and he gives us a hope.

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:09.539
Therefore, when facing trials, let's throw our burdens on Jehovah, confident that he will sustain us.

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:21.539
This time, the speaker rephrased the theme, where can you get help in times of distress, and he restated the talk's three main points.

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:29.539
He motivated his listeners by reminding them how to benefit from Jehovah's provisions.

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:33.539
His conclusion was simple and brief.

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:40.050
How might we apply these principles in the ministry?

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:51.050
In the following example, a brother named Aaron is talking to a workmate named Mark, who recently attended his grandfather's funeral.

00:03:51.050 --> 00:04:03.050
Aaron sees an opportunity to witness informally, so he tells Mark about the resurrection and shows him John 528 and 29.

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:10.050
Now, how might Aaron effectively conclude their conversation?

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:14.050
So, Jesus promises to resurrect those who've died?

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:18.740
Interesting.

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:21.740
Well, guess we better get back to work.

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:25.740
Not much of a conclusion, was it?

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.740
Let's watch him try again.

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:34.740
So, Jesus promises to resurrect those who've died.

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.740
Interesting.

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:43.850
What do you think that promise means for your grandfather?

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:52.850
In his conclusion, Aaron connected the topic of their conversation to the death of Mark's grandfather.

00:04:52.850 --> 00:05:01.850
But a good conclusion should also motivate your listeners and show them what to do with the information they learned.

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:05.850
Let's watch the rest of Aaron's conclusion.

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:15.850
So, Mark, during those times when your grandfather's death makes you especially sad, think about Jesus promise that death is not the end.

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:19.850
Imagine what it'll be like to see your grandfather again.

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:23.850
That helps me when I'm sad about relatives I've lost in death.

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:25.850
Thanks for sharing that.

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:27.850
Sure.

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:31.850
Maybe when we talk next time, I'll show you what Jesus said about.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.160
Well done.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:47.160
After repeating the main point for Mark to remember, Aaron motivated him to reflect on the resurrection hope during times of sadness.

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:59.160
Aaron could have also tried to motivate Mark to accept a Bible study to come with him to a congregation meeting or some other specific action.

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.160
And your conclusion is effective.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:11.160
Your audience will remember your theme and main points and be motivated to apply what they learned.
