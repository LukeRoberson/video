00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:06.500
Let's begin by visiting a family in Stockholm, Sweden.

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.539
The parents of Sama and Kristina have two daughters,

00:00:10.539 --> 00:00:13.140
Talita and Isabella.

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:18.940
When Talita was born, the doctor found cataracts in both of her eyes.

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:23.140
A cataract is a clouding of the eyes' natural lens.

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:28.140
So the doctor had to operate so that Talita wouldn't lose her sight completely,

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.739
a terrifying situation for any parent.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.140
Today, Talita is seven years old and almost blind in one eye,

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.539
but completely blind in the other.

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:44.740
Teaching a child about Jehovah and the system of things is already a challenge,

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:48.539
even without physical ailments involved.

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.539
But let's find out how Talita's parents rose to the challenge,

00:00:52.539 --> 00:01:01.899
making sure that she received a proper spiritual education despite her poor vision.

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:07.299
I look forward to not having poor sight anymore,

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:13.299
and that I can play with a bear and a lion and just sit on the back of a tiger.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.900
Jehovah gives us a fantastic promise in Isaiah 35-5.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.099
The eyes of the blind will be opened.

00:01:24.099 --> 00:01:28.099
It's been a challenge to get to where we are today.

00:01:28.099 --> 00:01:32.099
We thank Jehovah for all the help he has given us.

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:36.900
As soon as Talita was able to leave the house after operation,

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.099
we made sure to go to the meetings.

00:01:41.099 --> 00:01:45.900
It helped us a lot to be able to throw our burden on Jehovah.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:55.959
We prayed together, we cried a lot together because it was so hard.

00:01:55.959 --> 00:02:01.760
One of the challenges is that we have to give Talita audio description constantly.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.560
We have to tell her who is coming in and what is happening.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:14.560
We get so many amazing materials on JW.org and also through the congregation.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.560
She really loves to read, learn from the great teacher.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:25.530
It has questions which make her part from the story.

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.530
She has a very good memory and therefore she remembers a lot of what she reads.

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:39.039
So when we are with friends, she often quizzes them.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.370
She says, how are you doing?

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.370
You that is cardio, okay?

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.370
Then I'll do you that.

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:10.219
I really like to sing the songs in my song book.

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:17.150
Talita's spiritual goal is to learn more of our kingdom songs.

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.349
We get so much help from the beautiful music on the website

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:26.620
and also from the Caleb and Sophia videos.

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.219
She knows many of the stories from my book of Bible stories

00:03:30.219 --> 00:03:32.819
so she can answer in her own words.

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:36.620
We will ask the question like, do you know this about David?

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:44.340
And if she knows the answer, then we encourage her to answer at the meeting.

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:51.340
When I give an answer at the meetings, Jehovah becomes happy

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.340
because he loves children.

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.740
She often asks the friends, do you love Jehovah?

00:03:57.939 --> 00:03:59.939
So she feels very united with them.

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.849
One of the best moments where we saw that Talita's spirituality had grown

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:13.449
was when she came home from a sleepover at her grandparents' house.

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:16.050
My parents are not Jehovah's witnesses

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:19.449
and her grandmother had said that God doesn't exist.

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:21.850
So when Talita came home, she said,

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.449
and then when I was going to sleep, I prayed to Jehovah.

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:29.449
Would you please help grandmother to realize that you do exist

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:33.199
that you are real?

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:34.600
The fantasies go up, but we are high.

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.600
We try to keep our wonderful hope in life.

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:44.000
So we often talk about what we will do in paradise.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.600
We really look forward to when Talita will be able to see again,

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.600
living in a paradise with all our friends.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.199
It's going to be wonderful.

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:59.300
I think that Jehovah looks forward to looking at me when I play with a tiger.
