00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:07.900
A visit to the city of Salvador in Brazil is an amazing experience.

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:14.900
The beaches and the city's natural beauty are appreciated by the almost three million people that live here today.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:22.899
The people of the city of Salvador are known for their friendly smile, hospitality, and united spirit.

00:00:22.899 --> 00:00:26.899
But something else is remarkable in this city.

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:36.200
After serving in many parts of Brazil, I noted a big difference when I came to Salvador.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:42.200
The people here have a strong inclination toward spiritual things.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:52.820
The city of Salvador alone has just over 2.9 million inhabitants.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:06.819
Around 36,800 publishers and almost 41,400 Bible studies divided into 22 circuits and 351 congregations.

00:01:06.819 --> 00:01:15.290
This means that there is about one publisher for every 78 inhabitants.

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:23.290
When we find someone who's interested, they have either studied in the past, their parents are witnesses,

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:28.290
they already study the Bible, or they want to study.

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.290
Such growth creates new difficulties and challenges for Jehovah's people.

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:38.290
Where will all these interested people meet to serve Jehovah?

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:44.290
There in Salvador, many brothers and sisters are concentrated in a very small area.

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.760
We had a hard time finding properties.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:54.760
Besides that, the city is very hilly. It's almost impossible to find level properties.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:00.519
And then there's the city's zoning ordinance. It's very restrictive.

00:02:00.519 --> 00:02:04.519
So finding a suitable property was a real challenge.

00:02:04.519 --> 00:02:06.519
But then we came across this one.

00:02:06.519 --> 00:02:12.689
We thought, why not build there?

00:02:12.689 --> 00:02:14.689
That's why these complexes are needed.

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:21.689
Like this one in Pituba, which has six kingdom halls and one property for 15 congregations.

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:27.689
There are about 20 of these complexes. Some have four kingdom halls, others have three or two.

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:30.689
According to the needs locally.

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:35.689
This is not a standard kingdom hall.

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:46.090
We usually don't approve or recommend a building this size due to the complexity in planning the project and even in using the building.

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:52.090
There will be high traffic of both people and vehicles every day for meetings throughout the week.

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:58.090
But the branch made an exception in this case due to the large concentration of publishers in the area.

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.430
That's why this six auditorium complex was built.

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:11.250
It has three double kingdom halls with about 200 seats in each auditorium.

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:19.250
One complex I visit has two kingdom halls, six congregations with about 750 publishers.

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.250
That creates another challenge.

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:33.370
When I meet her brother, it's hard to know what congregation he belongs to, since everybody lives so close to each other.

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.370
For many publishers, this was no more than just a dream.

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.370
A well-structured kingdom hall that's comfortable and well ventilated.

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:46.370
We can't afford that. One brother even said, it won't happen in my lifetime.

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:51.370
The hall is so big, it has many pretty things.

00:03:51.370 --> 00:04:00.370
I thank Jehovah so much for having used this to build such a beautiful place for his worship and really all credit goes to him.

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:07.780
I'm so grateful to him and I hope to praise him even more in this kingdom hall he's prepared for us.

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.780
It's like a dream come true.

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.780
And now we have a suitable place where we can worship Jehovah.

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.779
Thank you, I don't deserve something this wonderful.

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:19.779
Thank you so much!

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:31.779
In Salvador and in many other regions of the earth, we clearly see the prophecy of Isaiah 54-2 being fulfilled by means of the construction of kingdom halls.

00:04:31.779 --> 00:04:39.569
The natural beauty of Salvador itself moves us to praise the one who created it all.

00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:49.569
But seeing how Jehovah is speeding things up and caring for his servants' needs in this crowded city, now that's something really special.
