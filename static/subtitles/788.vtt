00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:07.799
Today is an extraordinary day, one you will remember for a long, long time.

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:13.800
The day when you walked into an auditorium as students walked out as missionaries with

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.379
an exciting assignment ahead of you, and it's understandable if in moments like this you're

00:00:18.379 --> 00:00:26.320
thinking to yourself, will I be happy, will I be effective, and that's natural.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:33.439
So a big part of the answer to that question will lie in the matter of balance, now balance

00:00:33.439 --> 00:00:39.079
is a difficult concept to explain or describe, but fortunately there's a lovely passage

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:41.479
of scripture that helps us.

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:46.159
Let's go to Galatians chapter 6 and verse 2.

00:00:46.159 --> 00:00:51.880
The Apostle Paul writes there, go on carrying the burdens of one another and in this way you

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.359
will fulfill the law of the Christ.

00:00:55.359 --> 00:00:59.359
Those words should jump out at us, this is amazing, we get to fulfill the law of the Christ.

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:00.359
How?

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.359
By carrying the burdens of others.

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.719
So how will you do that in your assignment?

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:10.120
Much of what you do will be following in the footsteps of people like the Apostle Paul.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:15.400
For example, Paul helped people who had gotten involved in wrongdoing as an elder.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.959
You may do something similar.

00:01:16.959 --> 00:01:21.739
The Paul was involved in relief efforts when natural disasters such as famine afflicted

00:01:21.739 --> 00:01:23.200
God's people.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:29.959
Above all, Paul wanted to help lift the burden of ignorance, people who had been blinded

00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:35.719
by the God of this system of things and you have the privilege of doing something similar.

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:41.319
However did Paul also say that it's possible to go a little too far and lose balance?

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:45.599
He implies that it is because if you go down to verse 5, he says something a little bit

00:01:45.599 --> 00:01:46.599
in contrast.

00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:52.159
He says, for each one will carry his own load.

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:54.439
Now is he contradicting what he just said?

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:56.640
Of course not, we know he's inspired.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.680
And in fact, he used two different words.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:04.560
So in verse 2, the word burden, our study note says, this refers to heavy things, troublesome

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.240
things, things that are difficult to bear without some kind of assistance.

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.159
Whereas here in verse 5, he uses the word load.

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:18.879
In the study note, there says that it involves the personal load of responsibility to God that

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:23.039
each Christian is expected to carry.

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:29.039
In Bible times, it was sometimes used in a military context to refer to the pack that a soldier

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:30.039
might carry.

00:02:30.039 --> 00:02:33.879
Roman soldiers were trained to carry very, very heavy pack, heavier preps that they would

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:38.439
use in wartime and that would make them ready for the rigors of warfare.

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:43.219
Now imagine a soldier who out of kindness wants to carry not only his own pack, but the

00:02:43.219 --> 00:02:46.840
pack of the soldier next to him and the soldier on the other side.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.560
You can see he wouldn't last long and would he be helping his fellow soldiers?

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.680
Actually, he would be depriving them of the training they needed in order to be safe

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.599
in battle.

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:01.060
Sometimes children are taught a similar lesson about balance and not going too far in

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.400
helping someone else or something else.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.520
In the classroom, the teacher might have a little terrarium.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.759
In the terrarium is a branch hanging from the branches a little chrysalis and the kids

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:15.800
are all excited to see the butterfly emerge from that chrysalis.

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:19.439
When the day comes though, they might get a little disturbed because it takes a long

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:23.719
time and the butterfly really seems to struggle for hours and hours.

00:03:23.719 --> 00:03:27.960
Now if a well-meaning child wants to put his hand inside the terrarium and help the butterfly

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.280
out of the chrysalis, what does the teacher say?

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.000
Don't do that.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.719
I know you mean well, but you may actually kill him.

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:40.680
He explains that the butterfly by struggling his way out of the chrysalis develops strength

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.479
in his wings.

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:44.560
Without that, he may never fly.

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.159
He may therefore die as a result.

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:52.520
So it's possible for us, too, sometimes to want to do more than we should and actually

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:57.560
go past the point of carrying the burdens of others and moving into carrying their load

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.599
that they need to carry.

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:04.919
Jehovah's organization understands this principle beautifully, applies it in so many contexts.

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:08.759
I remember dear friend, a former missionary in Western Africa was telling me about a relief

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:12.120
work there and he was so impressed with how the branch handled it.

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.120
Refugees were flooding over the border from a war-torn country and the branch provided

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:21.279
them with food, shelter, clothing, but they also provided them as time went on with food

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:22.279
staples.

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:24.040
They could use to do a little business.

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.839
They could make food items to sell in local markets.

00:04:26.839 --> 00:04:32.600
So the gradually they were able to assume once again their own load of responsibilities.

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.360
So let's consider how we might apply this.

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.639
Let's look at three examples of where we might have thinking going through our mind that

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:43.160
not necessarily wrong, but it might just set off a little balance alert.

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.519
I should check my balance.

00:04:45.519 --> 00:04:49.839
Example one, I can change their hearts.

00:04:49.839 --> 00:04:53.759
Have you ever had that return visit or that Bible student you cared so much about and

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:58.040
you tried so many different ways and techniques to help the person to grow to love Jehovah

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:01.160
and they just don't seem to budge?

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:06.639
We might start getting at our head that we need to change their heart for them.

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:10.959
Remember though Jesus when he spoke to that rich young ruler and remember he told him

00:05:10.959 --> 00:05:15.040
what he needed to do and yet the man went away sad.

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:20.360
Do we imagine Jesus chasing after him, cajoling him, trying a new technique and knew he did

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:21.959
let him go?

00:05:21.959 --> 00:05:23.680
Jesus understood a basic principle.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:27.720
It's Jehovah God who works with the person to change their heart.

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.959
He didn't view that as his assignment.

00:05:29.959 --> 00:05:33.600
He didn't view it in other words as his job to bring people into the truth.

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.920
I remember dear older brother, I knew as a teenager, he studied with me in fact.

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:41.839
And if every year someone sort of puffed their chest up and say I brought so and so into

00:05:41.839 --> 00:05:48.879
the truth, he would quietly just say really was that Jehovah's week off?

00:05:48.879 --> 00:05:52.040
His point came across pretty clearly.

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:53.920
So there's a lovely balancing principle.

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:58.480
When we're thinking I can change someone's heart, remember what Paul wrote under inspiration.

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:05.199
I planted a polished water but God kept making it grow.

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:10.879
Example number two, I can carry their guilt.

00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:15.240
Have you ever had it happen that someone wanted you to feel bad for a sin that they themselves

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:16.560
committed?

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:19.199
Sometimes it's human nature to try to shift blame in that way.

00:06:19.199 --> 00:06:24.000
It goes back to Adam, remember him having the audacity to say to Jehovah God, it's this

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.160
woman you gave me.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:31.279
Or think of King Ahab, first king's 18, after the nation had suffered a three and a half

00:06:31.279 --> 00:06:35.319
year drought because of his sin leading the nation into idolatry.

00:06:35.319 --> 00:06:37.759
And he sees Elijah the prophet, what does he say?

00:06:37.759 --> 00:06:41.839
Is it you, the bringer of great trouble on Israel?

00:06:41.839 --> 00:06:45.879
Now did Elijah respond by saying, well Ahab you have a point, I'm not the best prophet.

00:06:46.879 --> 00:06:50.879
No, no, he said I have not brought trouble on Israel, but you have.

00:06:50.879 --> 00:06:52.920
You went following Bale.

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:59.879
If someone wants their sin to be your fault, don't carry that load.

00:06:59.879 --> 00:07:04.040
Remember a beautiful balancing principle, Ezekiel 18 verse 20.

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:10.079
The wickedness of the wicked one is accounted to him alone.

00:07:10.079 --> 00:07:14.199
Here's a third example, I can solve their problems.

00:07:14.199 --> 00:07:17.839
It's true, we can do a lot to help people with their problems, isn't it true sometimes

00:07:17.839 --> 00:07:20.600
those problems are burdens that we can help them carry.

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:25.079
But we might have a little balance alert, just go off and ask ourselves a couple of questions.

00:07:25.079 --> 00:07:28.720
First perhaps, is it really a problem?

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:31.279
Think of the example of Mary, Lazarus sister.

00:07:31.279 --> 00:07:36.600
Now she gave Jesus a very expensive gift, right, this costly perfumed oil.

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:41.319
And some of the disciples, even apostles apparently, were not happy about it.

00:07:41.319 --> 00:07:44.519
Matthew 26 says the disciples were indignant.

00:07:44.519 --> 00:07:48.560
Mark used an even stronger word, he said they were greatly annoyed.

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:54.519
One lexicon says that that word could actually be translated also as snort or bellow.

00:07:54.519 --> 00:07:58.360
Maybe you think more of an enraged farm animal than a loving apostle.

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:01.399
Why were they so upset, had Mary sinned?

00:08:01.399 --> 00:08:04.399
No, in fact Jesus said that what she'd done was a fine thing.

00:08:04.399 --> 00:08:06.519
It was beautiful in his eyes.

00:08:06.519 --> 00:08:08.120
So what was it?

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:11.040
They questioned her judgment.

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:12.720
Was it really their place?

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:14.560
Was it really a problem?

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:19.920
In fact, John writing six years later reveals it who might have led them into that mistake.

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:23.959
Judas Iscariot has mentioned as the one speaking there, and the study note mentions that

00:08:23.959 --> 00:08:28.800
maybe he was the one that they just agreed with and were convinced by.

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:33.559
In any case, they needed to remember the beautiful balancing principle that Jesus gave.

00:08:33.559 --> 00:08:37.879
Matthew 7-1, stop judging.

00:08:37.919 --> 00:08:43.639
The second question we might ask also, is it my place to get involved with this problem

00:08:43.639 --> 00:08:46.000
or to help fix this problem?

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.639
Remember the man who interrupted Jesus?

00:08:47.639 --> 00:08:52.039
He was giving a beautiful spiritual talk, and a man called out, tell my brother to divide

00:08:52.039 --> 00:08:53.759
the inheritance with me.

00:08:53.759 --> 00:08:54.759
How did Jesus respond?

00:08:54.759 --> 00:08:58.799
Did he say, well, you've come to the right place, I have the finest judicial mind on the

00:08:58.799 --> 00:08:59.799
planet?

00:08:59.799 --> 00:09:00.799
No.

00:09:00.799 --> 00:09:05.559
No, he understood that his assignment had limits given to him by his father, and it didn't

00:09:05.559 --> 00:09:08.120
include settling these family disputes.

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:13.440
So he said, who appointed me as judge or arbitrator over you persons?

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:15.799
Jesus was showing modesty.

00:09:15.799 --> 00:09:19.279
He understood the limits that Jehovah had given him.

00:09:19.279 --> 00:09:24.879
So there's a beautiful balancing principle, again, Micah 6 verse 8, walk modestly with

00:09:24.879 --> 00:09:26.480
your God.

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:31.480
So in conclusion, the question, will you be happy, will you be effective?

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:32.960
Of course you will.

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:36.399
You'll struggle to maintain your balance with such principles in mind.

00:09:36.399 --> 00:09:40.600
And you remember, of course, that when Jesus said, take my yoke upon you, he might have

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:44.039
been implying that you get under the yoke with him.

00:09:44.039 --> 00:09:49.320
In any case, you know that your Master Jesus will be helping you to carry your load.

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:52.919
You know that Jehovah God will be helping you to carry your load.

00:09:52.919 --> 00:09:56.840
They will always be there to help you carry your own load.
