00:00:01.649 --> 00:00:11.529
I was born in the truth, and when I was about 14, I became a publisher, and when I was

00:00:11.529 --> 00:00:23.820
still 14, I was no longer a publisher.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:31.100
I became a thief and a drug dealer when I was a teenager around 15, 16 years old.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.859
When I was older, I was arrested.

00:00:34.859 --> 00:00:38.500
I did a lot of bad things inside prison.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:47.299
I basically fought with everyone in there.

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:52.899
Anything that would make a smile or any reasons we had to be happy in prison were short-lived.

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:58.299
Your joy is gone because reality hit that you're in prison.

00:00:58.299 --> 00:01:03.859
When I saw that I was the reason that my situation kept getting worse and worse, I knew I had

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:07.530
to change.

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.689
I asked Jehovah for help, and then I remembered the account of Manasseh, who sacrificed

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:19.700
his own children, and he was forgiven by Jehovah.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.140
That account really helped me to understand that there was hope for me, and that I could

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.340
be forgiven.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.659
And then one day, during inmate visitation, I saw a brother inside there, and I asked him

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:36.629
if he was a Jehovah's Witness, and he said that he was.

00:01:36.629 --> 00:01:40.590
That's when I started my Bible study inside prison.

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.469
After studying for six months, I was transferred to an open prison where I could work during

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:47.950
the day and return to prison at night.

00:01:48.349 --> 00:01:52.230
Then that's when my situation hit rock bottom again.

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:57.430
My situation was so bad that I came to the conclusion that it would be better to escape

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:02.670
from there because if I didn't, I would die due to so much drug abuse.

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.989
And that's what I did at the first opportunity I had I escaped.

00:02:07.989 --> 00:02:12.830
After I escaped, I was determined again to change, to ask Jehovah for help, and to go

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.830
back to the meetings.

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.629
I would smoke, cry, and talk to Jehovah all at the same time, help me get out of this

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:27.509
situation because I know your name, and a person who knows your name can't use drugs.

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:31.430
Sometime later, I found out about a group of brothers and sisters who met at a kingdom

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.430
hall near my house.

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.189
That's when I started attending the meetings again, and I stopped using drugs with Jehovah's

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:39.189
help.

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:44.310
And after some time passed, I expressed my desire to be a publisher.

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:48.469
To this point, I hadn't told anything to my Bible teacher about my current situation with

00:02:48.469 --> 00:02:50.949
the law.

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:55.069
So on the day we consider the questions, ask the questions, right?

00:02:55.069 --> 00:03:00.909
And when we are at the end of the consideration, he looked at me and asked me just like this,

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:03.789
you don't have anything to tell me, do you?

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:06.870
Then he said, do you know why I'm asking you this?

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.469
Turn to the book of Acts, chapter five, and let's see what it says there.

00:03:11.469 --> 00:03:16.430
So I read the account about Ananias and Sapphira, who sold some property, but kept part of

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.710
the money, and because of their actions, they died.

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:26.310
It wasn't that they had lied to men, but they had lied to Jehovah.

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:33.340
It was at that moment that I realized that I needed to tell him about my situation.

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:39.979
I had to turn myself in, and I went back to the prison that I ran away from.

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:43.659
So I told my Bible teacher that's what I was going to do.

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:48.180
When I arrived at the front door of the penitentiary and the police officer saw me, he asked

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:55.819
if I was a lawyer, I was well dressed, had a tie on, I told him no, no officer.

00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:05.949
I'm a fugitive, and I came back here to serve my time.

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:10.789
I felt as if Jehovah had taken a huge weight off my shoulders.

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:18.300
I felt that he was now truly helping me.

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:23.259
After being a publisher for a few months back in prison, I expressed my desire to make

00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:25.459
a dedication to Jehovah.

00:04:25.459 --> 00:04:30.300
I received the privilege on the day of my baptism to leave the penitentiary and go to the

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.100
baptism location.

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:38.800
I was baptized, and at the end of the day, I went back to prison.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:44.730
After some time had passed, I received my freedom.

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:49.649
Making the decision to turn myself in and go back to prison was the best way that I found

00:04:49.649 --> 00:04:55.399
to show my love for Jehovah.

00:04:55.399 --> 00:04:59.800
It's for this reason that I have come to the conclusion that being in prison brought

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:00.680
me freedom.
