00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:10.980
How does a father feel when he receives an unexpected gift from his child?

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.859
Of course, his heart is warmed.

00:00:13.859 --> 00:00:15.460
Why?

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:19.660
Because he sees this as an expression of the child's love for him.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:25.960
Well, in a similar way, our loving Heavenly Father, Jehovah, does not want to force us

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.899
to serve him.

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:34.820
He's interested in our motives, and he wants us to serve him out of love.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.219
Why?

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:40.299
Because Jehovah realizes that love has power.

00:00:40.299 --> 00:00:46.140
He gives us the power to make changes in our life, and also it helps us to be able to

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.140
overcome temptations and opposition.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.659
But that presents a challenge for us when we conduct the Bible studies.

00:00:55.659 --> 00:00:56.659
How so?

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:04.859
Well, how can we develop within the hearts of the Bible students a love for Jehovah without

00:01:04.859 --> 00:01:08.819
forcing them or trying to put pressure on them?

00:01:08.819 --> 00:01:13.780
Well, that's something that we need to think about.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.260
During these talks, we've certainly enjoyed the series of videos, haven't we, that have

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:25.019
helped us to see how Jade has made progress with her Bible study and how Nita has helped

00:01:25.099 --> 00:01:27.420
her all along?

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:34.140
When we think about this, we see that Jade has made good progress, and she's up to

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.340
a point now where she has a love for Jehovah.

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:46.700
In this final video, let's watch how Jade faces a very difficult problem, and we'll see

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.420
how her love for Jehovah helps us to overcome this problem.

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:54.060
But Mum, listen.

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.859
No, Jade. You listen.

00:01:56.859 --> 00:02:01.019
It's just another of your faders. It's time to move on love.

00:02:01.019 --> 00:02:07.150
All the days are our time. It's all I get from you.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:28.430
Promise me you'll be here.

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:35.789
I really don't want to disappoint her, but I can't disappoint Jehovah, of course.

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:38.509
You love them both.

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:42.560
Don't you think you can help you? Talk to him.

00:02:49.039 --> 00:03:03.419
I spent a long time pouring out my heart to him, and I remembered something from one of the

00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:16.370
Psalms. I will walk in your truth, unify my heart to fear your name.

00:03:16.370 --> 00:04:14.110
Remember someone once claiming to be all about the promises?

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:17.069
Made any good ones lately?

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:17.949
Absolutely.

00:04:24.509 --> 00:04:27.389
Well, that certainly was a difficult problem, wasn't it?

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:31.870
Her mother wanting to force her to join her in a worldly holiday.

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:38.189
But what helped Jade? As she said, it's true she loves her mother,

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.550
but she didn't want to disappoint Jehovah.

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:46.110
And not as neither didn't try to go through all the pros and cons with her.

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:50.829
She realized that Jade had a love for Jehovah, and she just simply said,

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:54.829
ask him for help, and Jehovah did help her.

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:03.069
So how can we make sure that our Bible students come to a similar point in their life where they

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:04.110
love Jehovah?

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:08.269
Well, we find some help with regard to that question.

00:05:08.269 --> 00:05:14.509
If we turn to the first book of John, so please turn with me to first John, chapter 4,

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:23.329
and we're going to read verse 8, whoever does not love has not come to know God

00:05:24.209 --> 00:05:25.490
because God is love.

00:05:27.089 --> 00:05:28.290
What is this telling us?

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:33.970
You see, basically it is saying if our Bible student doesn't love God,

00:05:34.689 --> 00:05:37.490
that's because they haven't really come to know God yet.

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:43.810
And if we turn the page to verse 19, there's a secondary point that's mentioned.

00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:48.850
It says, we love because he first loved us.

00:05:49.649 --> 00:05:51.810
What does this highlight?

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:57.970
Well, for our Bible student to love Jehovah, they need to come to know him, but also,

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:01.970
they need to see his love in their lives.

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:08.449
So that puts a responsibility on us to help them to identify Jehovah's love,

00:06:08.449 --> 00:06:12.529
and then have this love for Jehovah building their hearts.

00:06:12.529 --> 00:06:18.449
We can do that by asking questions such as, how have you seen Jehovah's love in your life?

00:06:19.009 --> 00:06:20.850
Well, what does this Bible account?

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:22.689
Teachers about Jehovah's love.

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:29.089
In other words, although we are interested in explaining what Jehovah has done

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:33.490
by highlighting what he does, how he does it, and when he does it,

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:39.250
we would never want to forget the vital question, why does he do something?

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:45.089
The answer is because of his love, and we hope our Bible student to see that.

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:54.529
You see, Jehovah's power enables him to do things. His wisdom helps him and guides him along with

00:06:54.529 --> 00:07:03.649
justice to do things the right way. But what is it that motivates Jehovah? It's his love, isn't it?

00:07:04.449 --> 00:07:09.410
And asking the question, why Jehovah does things helps to highlight that point?

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:17.089
So as we're teaching our Bible students, we need them to see that Jehovah really does love them,

00:07:17.649 --> 00:07:24.129
and he wants them to succeed in their life. Also, we could perhaps share with them some of the

00:07:24.129 --> 00:07:29.889
times that we personally have experienced Jehovah's love, perhaps in the way that Jehovah has answered

00:07:29.889 --> 00:07:35.889
our prayers. But in connection with this, there's another scripture that can help us.

00:07:36.449 --> 00:07:44.050
If you turn with me, please, to the book of Isaiah. Isaiah chapter 48, and we're going to look at

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:58.129
verses 17 and 18. Isaiah 48, 17 and 18. This is what Jehovah says, your repurchaser, the holy one of

00:07:58.129 --> 00:08:07.009
Israel. I, Jehovah, am your God, the one teaching you to benefit yourself, the one guiding you in the

00:08:07.009 --> 00:08:14.610
way you should walk. If only you would pay attention to my commandments, then your peace would become

00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:22.290
just like a river and your righteousness like the waves of the sea. Do you see the point that's

00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:29.490
being made here? We need to help the Bible student to understand that Jehovah really wants the best

00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:36.289
for them, and he's helping and guiding them in the way that they should go. And the end result,

00:08:36.289 --> 00:08:41.330
we notice there in verse 18, is that peace and righteousness will be their reward.

00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:49.730
Well, this truly is something that can help the Bible student. In fact, when they start to face the

00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:55.330
changes that they need to make in life, if they have this love for Jehovah, they won't just view it

00:08:55.330 --> 00:09:04.289
as something they have to do in order to attain everlasting life. No, they'll view these things as

00:09:04.289 --> 00:09:12.539
opportunities for them to prove their love of Jehovah. Well, what is this symposium, Sean?

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:19.500
As we've listened to the various talks and watched the videos, it's helped us to see various ways

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:27.340
that we can help our Bible students to make progress. We realize that conducting a Bible study and

00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:33.100
helping someone to become a disciple is not just a matter of reading certain paragraphs in a book

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:42.700
or using certain techniques. A lot more is involved. What else? Well, remember the apostle Paul was

00:09:42.779 --> 00:09:48.779
an experienced disciple maker. And let's turn our Bibles to the first book of Thessalonians.

00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:54.700
And we'll notice here under inspiration, the apostle Paul tells us what else is involved.

00:09:56.220 --> 00:10:01.179
First, Thessalonians chapter 2, and we're going to read verses 7 and 8.

00:10:03.019 --> 00:10:10.139
On the contrary, we became gentle in your midst as when a nursing mother tenderly cares for her own

00:10:10.139 --> 00:10:17.580
children. So having tender affection for you, we were determined to impart to you not only the good

00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:28.539
news of God, but also our very selves because you became so beloved to us. Yes, we really need to

00:10:28.539 --> 00:10:36.220
care for these ones. We need to nurture them, help them with the problems and obstacles they face

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:45.179
along the way. And yes, we need to become their friends. Well, becoming a disciple maker is a

00:10:45.179 --> 00:10:51.659
challenging work. There's a lot involved with it, but don't feel overwhelmed. You can do it

00:10:52.299 --> 00:10:59.019
with Jehovah's help and the help of Jesus Christ. Remember when Jesus gave us a commission to go and

00:10:59.019 --> 00:11:06.940
make disciples, what else did He say? Look, I am with you. Yes, with Jehovah's help and with the

00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:14.779
help of Jesus, we can experience a wonderful joy. What is that joy? The joy of seeing a new

00:11:14.779 --> 00:11:17.820
disciple learned to love Jehovah.
