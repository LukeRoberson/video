WEBVTT

00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:32.450
We are delighted to welcome one and all to the June 2022 program of J.W. Broadcasting.

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:39.810
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, all of the students in the previous class of Gilead were from

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:41.649
the United States.

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:49.329
However, we were very happy that the governing body approved for 24 fully vaccinated

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:58.210
brothers and sisters from 13 different lands to be invited to the 151st class of Gilead.

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:10.849
On March 12, 2022, this enthusiastic class graduated. How did they personally benefit from the school?

00:01:12.209 --> 00:01:18.609
How will they use their five months of Bible training? Where will they be assigned?

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:27.090
Please enjoy part one of the 151st Gilead graduation program.

00:01:28.769 --> 00:01:36.209
Well, class 151, you seem excited and you should be. This is a very special day for you,

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:41.250
one you'll never forget, just as the entire course of Gilead you'll never forget.

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:48.689
And we're happy to be with you today and we will all benefit from the things that are said today

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:56.930
at this spiritual program. But even so, we know that although this will benefit everyone involved,

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:04.209
the program has been designed with you in mind. So every talk given, the brothers have

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:10.370
prayerfully considered what can be said to encourage and as you listen, just be certain that the

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:15.169
brothers have had that in mind. But all of us listening today will benefit from the good things

00:02:15.169 --> 00:02:20.610
that will come out in this program. When the day is over, you'll look back and recall a program

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:26.610
that honored Jehovah and confirmed his love for you. And again, you're never going to forget it.

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:32.449
During the past five months of your schooling, you were asked to draw out principles from many

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:38.289
different Bible accounts and you worked hard to do that, didn't you? And you learned new ways

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:45.889
to do that to see the scriptures as something that Jehovah wants us to listen to very carefully

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:54.129
and then apply its fine points in our lives. So those accounts focused on genuine servants of

00:02:54.129 --> 00:03:01.650
God who with his help succeeded in doing his will and you are doing the same. You examine principles

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.610
for Christian living. You examined principles for teaching others. You looked at principles

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:13.569
about how to organize the work and so forth. This graduation program will do the same.

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:19.969
With that in mind, I have a theme for these brief introductory comments. I thought it would keep

00:03:19.969 --> 00:03:28.530
me focused. So here's my theme. You are ready to face the things ahead. Now, notice it's not a question.

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:33.810
Are you ready? It's a statement. You are ready to face the things ahead.

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:42.370
Now, why can we say this with such confidence? Because we see your faith. We see your deep love

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:48.689
for our Heavenly Father, Jehovah and His Son. You've trusted in Jehovah. You have done well

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:54.129
and you made it to graduation day. I know some of you wondered if you would make it.

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:01.810
But you did. Here you are. You're graduating with the 151st class of Gilead. What a delight.

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:08.689
You undoubtedly agree more than ever before with what the Apostle Paul wrote at Philippians chapter 4

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:15.409
and verse 13, where he said, for all things, I have the strength through who?

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:24.209
The one who gives me power. And we know who that is. And Jehovah has surely helped you during

00:04:24.209 --> 00:04:30.529
these months to make a success of Gilead school. And we're very proud of you for that. And you can

00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:37.490
be certain that Jehovah is just delighted to see that because you love him. And you went through

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:43.970
this course. You've gone through it with that in mind. True. Jehovah gave you what you needed.

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:50.769
And that's a blessing you must never forget. By remembering it, you will put that blessing to work

00:04:50.769 --> 00:04:56.610
for you wherever you are in your service to Jehovah in the weeks, months, and years ahead.

00:04:57.569 --> 00:05:02.370
Really, these things you learn that all of us learn now will serve us well forever.

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:10.370
For example, whenever you face a task in the future that seems almost too large for you to tackle

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:17.810
or handle, you'll remember how Jehovah helped you in this school. Your experience in going through

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:26.449
Gilead now adds to your extensive experience, the experience you already had in serving Jehovah.

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:33.970
But this just enriches it that much more. And it will help you as you face trials and tests ahead.

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:38.930
In that you'll know you can make it through what you may view as difficult times

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:45.730
because Jehovah will help you to do it. You are growing ever more and more ready to face the

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:52.129
things ahead. You already are, but you'll grow more and more so, like all of us will, as we reflect

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:59.410
on and remember what Jehovah has done for us, such as helping you to complete this Bible school course.

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:06.610
Here's an example of things you must be ready to handle or you may face. Soon after your

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:13.410
graduation, you will be off to your assignments. And as you go, have in mind Jesus' words where he

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:20.610
taught his disciples to pray, do not bring us into temptation, but deliver us from the wicked one.

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:29.730
Now, focus on the words temptation and wicked one. They go together, don't they? Temptation and

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:35.569
wicked one. Satan and wicked one doesn't like your success here at Gilead. You can be certain that

00:06:35.569 --> 00:06:41.810
he hates this school and all the good that it is accomplished through the years and honoring Jehovah,

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:49.410
benefiting his people and those in the field. So then, what temptations or stumbling blocks might

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:56.050
Satan try to place before you now that you've graduated from this school? Well, here are a few

00:06:56.050 --> 00:07:03.730
things and there are things that all of us must face. For example, if you're not careful, you might

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:10.370
be tempted to become self-satisfied with what you have accomplished. Don't ever let that happen to

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:17.649
you. Never be self-satisfied. Keep setting goals for yourself. Strive to please Jehovah more and more

00:07:17.649 --> 00:07:24.610
each day and all that you do. It's the principles that we draw from God's Word that help us to do that.

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:31.410
Yet here's a caution. Your healthy desire to keep setting goals must not be allowed to lead you

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:37.970
into the next temptation and that is this, the temptation to give and to pride. That can happen.

00:07:39.089 --> 00:07:47.649
It can happen to a person when he or she forgets who has truly helped them to succeed and that is

00:07:47.649 --> 00:07:53.730
Jehovah. Those who forget about Jehovah may become ambitious and try to outshine others. We

00:07:53.730 --> 00:08:00.449
must never allow that to happen to our heart and mind. We must never become like that. In fact,

00:08:00.449 --> 00:08:06.290
we must fight against pride and one key way to do this is to remember that in all that you do,

00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:15.410
in all that we do, it is always about Jehovah. When we have that focus, we will succeed in doing

00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:22.290
things his way, the right way, no matter what we face in the future. So we reflect on his blessings,

00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:27.889
we see how he strengthened us, we're confident he will continue to do so and he will do that for you,

00:08:28.769 --> 00:08:36.610
but we never forget that he's in charge. It's always about Jehovah and so we do everything out of

00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:44.850
love for him and that of course leads into love for others because he loves others. If a person

00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:50.610
fails to remember how Jehovah has blessed him or her, that person might become big in their own

00:08:51.169 --> 00:08:57.330
eyes like King Saul did. You'll recall his example. Where did that eventually lead Saul? It let him

00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:05.490
away from Jehovah's favor and blessing. People like Saul fail to maintain faith. They fail to

00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:13.570
remain humble. What about your faith and your humility? Well, we see those good qualities in you

00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:20.049
and that's why we confidently state you're ready to face the things ahead. Along with Jehovah's

00:09:20.049 --> 00:09:25.730
blessing, your faith will help you to conquer any temptation that the wicked one, the

00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:33.090
tempter, may place before you and your humility, will help you to remain unbreakable. You will be

00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:40.929
able to defeat the tempter. Along with resisting temptation, your Gilead training will also help you

00:09:40.929 --> 00:09:46.690
to continue supporting our vital work for Jehovah's Kingdom, his people and for those who will yet

00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:53.570
listen. In fact, for all of God's people, this is the greater purpose behind any training that we

00:09:53.570 --> 00:10:00.769
receive from him, right? So then wherever you serve, never forget the purpose behind the blessings

00:10:00.769 --> 00:10:06.529
that you have experienced in this school. Trust in Jehovah and in his son to help you at all times.

00:10:06.529 --> 00:10:11.889
Use your Gilead training in the branches and territories to where you are going. Keep in mind that

00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:17.250
with God's help, the one who gives you power, you are ready to face the things ahead.

00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:23.409
Well, we will say a little bit more about this at the conclusion of the program. Now we're going to

00:10:23.409 --> 00:10:29.809
enjoy a series of encouraging talks that for all of us will strengthen our faith, build up our

00:10:29.809 --> 00:10:38.529
trusting God, and highlight his wonderful purpose that we support. So for the first talk,

00:10:39.169 --> 00:10:45.889
we have a brother Garrett Loach of the governing body. He will speak on the subject, cultivate love

00:10:45.889 --> 00:10:57.980
that never fails. Do you want to be loved by others? Naturally, we all want to be loved. Love is a

00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:05.100
basic human need. Babies thrive on it, teenagers thrive on it, marriage mates thrive on it,

00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:11.259
breathalytes and Gilead students thrive on it. It makes us happy to be loved.

00:11:12.539 --> 00:11:19.740
What about loving others? Love is unselfish. Loving others makes the receivers happy,

00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:29.740
but it also makes us as givers happy. Love is the reason why we exist. Jehovah created us out of

00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:35.659
unselfish love to let us share not only life, but also the privilege to love him.

00:11:37.019 --> 00:11:44.700
Jehovah does not need our love since he does not depend on anybody else, but he appreciates our love.

00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:53.179
He loves to be loved by us. He created us also with the ability to love others besides him.

00:11:54.139 --> 00:12:02.139
We loved to do good to others. We loved to love them. Since when does love exist?

00:12:03.179 --> 00:12:13.500
It always existed. It had no beginning. Why? Because God is love and we know God had no beginning.

00:12:14.139 --> 00:12:22.220
So God's love had no beginning. There was no time in the past when God existed, but love did not.

00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:28.620
Jehovah not only has love, but he is love-personified.

00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:38.059
Jehovah created us in his image. This is why we have the superb privilege to reflect his love.

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:45.899
In the world, books, movies and songs often deal with love, but what kind of love?

00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:55.419
Usually romantic love, love that often fails. Genuine love of God and of neighbor is widely lacking

00:12:55.419 --> 00:13:04.620
today. When describing the last days the prophecy at 2 Timothy 3 verse 2 has come true that people are

00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:15.259
often lovers of themselves. Meism and Egotism is widespread. One journal carries the title

00:13:15.259 --> 00:13:22.700
Self. People think, first me, then nothing, and then me again, and then perhaps somebody else.

00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:32.620
In 2 Timothy 3, 2 Paul also wrote that people would be lovers of money. In the same

00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:38.940
prophecy it says the majority would be lovers of pleasures rather than lovers of God.

00:13:39.659 --> 00:13:46.139
For many, entertainment and sports have become the dominant aspect of their lives.

00:13:47.179 --> 00:13:56.059
Furthermore, first John 2.15 indicates there is a battle between two loves, love of Jehovah and

00:13:56.059 --> 00:14:03.500
love of the world. The stronger our love for Jehovah is, the better we will be able to resist the love

00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:14.139
of the world. At Matthew 22.37 Jesus encouraged cultivating love for God to the fullest extent possible.

00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:23.659
You must love Jehovah your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole mind.

00:14:25.659 --> 00:14:32.700
How does love for Jehovah grow? We must tend to the good soil of our heart where the seed

00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:42.379
of kingdom truth was so. How does love between two persons grow? One way is by communication.

00:14:43.179 --> 00:14:51.179
We communicate with Jehovah through prayer. Jehovah communicates with us through the Bible and his

00:14:51.179 --> 00:14:59.100
organization. If we study the Bible and read it daily as well as attend the congregation meetings,

00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:08.830
our love for Him will continue to grow. Love needs to grow. It is not a matter of how much we know,

00:15:09.789 --> 00:15:18.909
but how much we love what we know. Head knowledge is not enough. There needs to be heart knowledge.

00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:28.190
Growing in love is a process. A plant grows when it is watered. Love grows if it is watered with

00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:33.629
the water of truth. In Philippians chapter 1 verse 9, Paul says,

00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:41.309
and this is what I continue praying that your love may abound yet more and more.

00:15:43.470 --> 00:15:50.350
Love grows gradually. It is not enough to have a little love. We should abound in love.

00:15:51.309 --> 00:15:56.669
Jehovah says the example, he expressed his love by providing the ransom.

00:15:58.110 --> 00:16:04.669
In Matthew chapter 18, Jesus compares Jehovah with a king who was willing to forgive

00:16:04.669 --> 00:16:14.429
a debt of 60 million dinarii or 10,000 silver talents. This certainly impresses his love for us.

00:16:15.149 --> 00:16:23.549
Jesus expressed his love by being willing to die for our sins. This there is our love in return.

00:16:23.549 --> 00:16:31.389
The more one has been forgiven, the more one will love. But love is not dependent on having one

00:16:31.389 --> 00:16:39.950
sins forgiven. Jesus loved Jehovah so much but had not a single sin that needed to be forgiven.

00:16:40.909 --> 00:16:49.789
But he loved Jehovah and he loved us. The night before he died, he said at John 1431,

00:16:49.789 --> 00:17:01.950
I love the Father. Do we not all of us feel the same? How can we demonstrate our love of God in return?

00:17:02.909 --> 00:17:10.509
We can do so by serving Jehovah with all our heart. This includes preaching and teaching.

00:17:12.190 --> 00:17:18.190
True or false, the most important reason for preaching and teaching is love of neighbor.

00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:26.109
It sounds good, but it is wrong. The most important motive for preaching is first of all,

00:17:26.829 --> 00:17:36.349
love for Jehovah and the most important objective is to praise Jehovah. We want to glorify him and

00:17:36.349 --> 00:17:44.910
to support the vindication of his sovereignty. Love of neighbor comes second. But we also need to

00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:51.549
show love to our brothers. In one congregation several sisters took daily turns to prepare a hot

00:17:51.549 --> 00:17:58.589
meal for a quadriplegic brother. This shows that our love extends beyond preaching.

00:17:59.710 --> 00:18:05.470
It is like with the parable of the Samaritan who cared for the man that was assaulted and hurt

00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:12.430
by a robbers. The Samaritan did not preach to the man who fell among the robbers. He just showed

00:18:12.430 --> 00:18:21.069
unselfish love to him. Jesus emphasized that our neighborly love should include even enemies.

00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:24.829
In Matthew 5, 44, he said,

00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:32.190
I say to you, continue to love your enemies and to pray for those persecuting you.

00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:42.740
Our love will be perfect if we love even our enemies. Jehovah gives sunshine and rain even to

00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:51.299
wicked opposers. One publisher went to a hospital to visit an opposing husband. The man appreciated

00:18:51.299 --> 00:19:00.099
this kind gesture very much. Think of what Jesus has endured. He was hated without cause,

00:19:00.099 --> 00:19:07.539
persecuted, reviled and murdered. Help people to develop their appreciation for what Jesus

00:19:07.539 --> 00:19:16.740
did for us. Show interested ones that because of the ransom, Jehovah forgives us our sins and

00:19:16.819 --> 00:19:24.420
open the way to everlasting life. When you talk about the ransom, don't do it just in a legalistic

00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:31.460
way by saying, see, like on scales, on one side was Adam and on the other side was Jesus.

00:19:32.019 --> 00:19:36.900
God's justice required that by giving His life Jesus restored what Adam had lost.

00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:45.140
Rather, make the student meditate and develop heart appreciation and love for what Jesus did.

00:19:45.859 --> 00:19:50.099
Review with the student what Jesus went through prior to His execution,

00:19:50.819 --> 00:19:57.380
help Him picture in His mind how Jesus was flogged, producing querying ribbons of bleeding flesh.

00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:08.099
Help the student sense how Jesus was mocked after His tortured beating soldiers said to Him mockingly,

00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:16.259
Good day, you king of the Jews. Also, they spit on Him and slapped Him in the face.

00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:24.220
Remind the student how the soldiers later pounded large nails into His hands and into His feet.

00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:32.700
With the stakes swung upright, the pain was excruciating for the weight of the body toer all the

00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:40.940
nail wounds. Yet, rather than threaten Jesus' prey for the Roman soldiers, Father forgive them

00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:47.809
for they do not know what they are doing. Meditating on what Jesus did for us,

00:20:48.450 --> 00:20:56.210
does this not greatly deepen our love for Him? At Division 319 Paul wrote,

00:20:56.690 --> 00:21:04.930
The love of the Christ surpasses knowledge. It is not the love for the Christ, but the love that Jesus

00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:11.650
displayed that surpasses hate knowledge and strikes a wonderful court in our figurative heart.

00:21:13.819 --> 00:21:20.220
Jesus' chorus stimulates a response in us. As we think about what Christ has done for us,

00:21:20.299 --> 00:21:26.220
our love for Him deepens. In fact, Second Corinthians 514 says,

00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:29.420
For the love the Christ has compels us.

00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:37.259
After mentioning gifts of the Spirit such as healing and speaking in tongues, Paul explained that

00:21:37.259 --> 00:21:43.339
First Corinthians 1231, yet I show you a surpassing way.

00:21:44.779 --> 00:21:54.700
What is this way? The way of love. In what way is it surpassing? In the sense that the gifts

00:21:54.700 --> 00:22:02.460
of the Spirit, including prophesying, would be done away with. But love would always be there.

00:22:03.019 --> 00:22:12.940
Jehovah is eternal. His love will never fail, never end, but will continue forever and ever and ever.

00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:23.420
Therefore Paul wrote, Their remained faith, hope, love, these three. But the greatest of these is love.

00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:34.140
He also wrote, Love never fails. Love endures all things. Many brothers suffered a lot during World War

00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:40.059
2 and today in Russia and other countries. Today there are a number of governments in the world

00:22:40.059 --> 00:22:46.859
that suppress the truth. As we live in the time of the end, this is not surprising to us.

00:22:46.859 --> 00:22:50.059
It will get worse as the Great Tribulation comes closer.

00:22:51.019 --> 00:22:58.380
Well, conditions also get worse in many parts of the world and Covid has claimed many human victims.

00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:07.740
But we witnesses keep enduring by pursuing the surpassing way of love that never fails.

00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:13.740
We shall not only live forever but also love forever and be loved forever.

00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:29.900
Well, thank you very much, Brother Loesch, for reminding us of how great Jehovah's love is for us

00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:35.579
and how we in turn must show heartfelt, wholehearted love for Jehovah and others.

00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:42.700
Our next talk on the program will be given by Brother Gaius Glockentine,

00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:48.619
a helper to the publishing committee and the theme for his talk is, How often will you go to Shiloh?

00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:58.740
They were speechless when they heard she would leave home and join full-time service.

00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:06.019
Instead of pursuing their common goals, dreams and hopes, she would do whatever she was told to do.

00:24:06.019 --> 00:24:12.819
What is sacrifice? They were so proud of her and they started thinking about what to do in order to

00:24:12.819 --> 00:24:20.339
support her. Who are we talking about? Let us open to Judges 11.

00:24:21.619 --> 00:24:28.980
And let's find out who they were and what they did. They are soon to be graduates.

00:24:29.619 --> 00:24:35.940
What they did is something that will help you to succeed in your assignment.

00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:40.019
Let's read, please, Judges 11 verse 40.

00:24:41.619 --> 00:24:48.019
From year to year, the young women of Israel would go to give

00:24:48.819 --> 00:24:54.259
commendation to the daughter of Jeff DeGilia died four days in the year.

00:24:55.859 --> 00:25:01.539
The young women of Israel went to the sanctuary in Shiloh in order to give

00:25:02.019 --> 00:25:08.099
commendation and praise to the daughter of Jeff DeGilia, commendation strengthened this full-time

00:25:08.099 --> 00:25:14.500
servant of Jehovah. Is this not what you want to do, too? So that's why we have the question

00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:24.579
for you. How often will you go to Shiloh? Will you strengthen others and stabilize the organization

00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:32.500
by regularly commanding and praising others? Let us therefore ask the following questions.

00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:39.539
What type of commendation is effective in strengthening others? How can you imitate the young

00:25:39.539 --> 00:25:46.900
women of Israel and why do you want to give commendation regularly? Let's start with the first

00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:52.900
question. What type of commendation is effective in strengthening others? And let us please look at

00:25:52.980 --> 00:26:01.619
the example that Jesus said as we turn to Mark chapter 5. Here he comments the frightened sick

00:26:01.619 --> 00:26:10.019
woman who touched his outer garment. As we read Mark chapter 5 verse 35-4, please watch out for

00:26:10.019 --> 00:26:20.339
five elements of effective commendation. Mark 5 verse 34. He said to her

00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:30.740
daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace and be healed from your crevice sickness.

00:26:31.779 --> 00:26:40.980
Did you know what made this commendation effective? First, effective commendation is specific.

00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:49.859
Jesus commanded the woman for what she did. Her faith moved her to act. Effective commendation is

00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:59.299
sincere. The woman's faith was real and outstanding. Did you notice that Jesus did not use the

00:26:59.299 --> 00:27:06.740
opportunity to counsel her for violating the law? This might have made his commendation sound

00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:14.660
in sincere. Third, effective commendation is personal. Jesus used the expression daughter

00:27:15.619 --> 00:27:24.259
that expression emphasized his tender concern for her. Fourth, effective commendation is more than

00:27:24.259 --> 00:27:30.420
words. Jesus acknowledged the needs of the woman and followed up with deeds. He healed her.

00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:40.420
And fifth, effective commendation is unselfish. Jesus did not command the woman in order to make

00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:48.420
himself look good, but he was concerned about her and wanted to make her feel good. Now, can you do

00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:56.660
the same? Let's go back to Judges 11 and let's look again at verse 40. So this is Judges 11,

00:27:56.660 --> 00:28:01.539
verse 40. And let's answer the second question, how can you imitate the young women of Israel?

00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:09.460
So the verse started here in verse 40 saying, from year to year, so this means

00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:19.140
regularly, repeatedly. The young women would praise the same person again and again.

00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:25.539
In your assignment, as you work with others in Bethel in the ministry or watch them in your

00:28:25.539 --> 00:28:33.140
congregation, can you repeatedly praise them? For instance, could you praise them for their

00:28:33.140 --> 00:28:40.500
zeal, their fine efforts or for their acts of love? Could you send an up building text message

00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:48.500
saying, great job. Well done. Thumbs up. Loved it. Maybe along with a brief comment.

00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:55.380
These messages do not require a lot of effort and time, but they can go a long way.

00:28:56.500 --> 00:29:03.460
One time is not enough. Do it again and again. Don't worry. The person could get a big head.

00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:11.059
In the Bible, Jehovah praised and commanded the persons that he loved repeatedly.

00:29:12.339 --> 00:29:20.019
Commending others again and again is a good thing. Now, the verse continues here saying,

00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:25.539
the young women of Israel would go to give commendation to the daughter of Jeff Ta, the Gilead

00:29:25.539 --> 00:29:34.420
died four days in the year. Being away from their family obligation must have been a sacrifice.

00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:42.339
Somebody else must have taken over their usual work. They had to travel to Shiloh and they

00:29:42.339 --> 00:29:50.420
may also have brought a gift. Now, could this serve as a reminder that giving commendation might

00:29:50.420 --> 00:29:58.900
sometimes require a little bit more time and effort? Can come at a personal cost? Yes. Calling

00:29:58.900 --> 00:30:08.660
somebody or visiting him requires time and effort. Spending time with your brother and sister

00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:16.420
honors them. Being out with them in the ministry, working together on a project or asking them for

00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:25.859
advice really makes them feel good and can be a powerful commendation. It's worth all it costs.

00:30:28.019 --> 00:30:32.500
Timing is important too. Proverbs 15, verse 23 states,

00:30:33.140 --> 00:30:41.059
a word spoken at the right time. How good is it? So what is the right time for commendation?

00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:46.259
The verses leading up to our theme scripture here mentioned that Jeff Ta's daughter

00:30:47.059 --> 00:30:54.420
right away got much needed support. So generally speaking, commendation is of greatest value

00:30:54.420 --> 00:31:02.420
when it's given as soon as the opportunity comes up, even if it's initially just a brief comment.

00:31:02.740 --> 00:31:09.859
The sooner somebody receives positive feedback, the quicker feelings of insecurity or doubts will

00:31:09.859 --> 00:31:17.619
vanish and the sooner the other person will be happy and feel good. Please do not wait too long,

00:31:18.259 --> 00:31:25.619
but act right away. Now, this leads us to our third and final question. Why do you want to give

00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:32.579
commendation regularly? As you go to your assignments, you will be surrounded by many

00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:40.740
daughters of Jeff Ta, faithful, full-time servants of Jehovah who made sacrifices to serve.

00:31:41.619 --> 00:31:51.380
This auditorium is full of them and you are among them. You will meet brothers and sisters

00:31:51.380 --> 00:32:00.740
in the congregation and some of them are insecure, worried, sometimes doubt that they are worth

00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:07.220
anything. They are giving their very best to stay faithful despite challenges, fighting with

00:32:07.220 --> 00:32:13.859
their own imperfection, dealing with the results of their own mistakes and are sometimes discouraged

00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:24.339
because of setbacks. They need commendation. We all need commendation. Because commendation

00:32:24.339 --> 00:32:31.460
enhances a person's self-esteem, it builds confidence and motivates to action. It reinforces our

00:32:31.460 --> 00:32:41.299
desire to do good things and it encourages us to keep on doing our very best. Please go to Shiloh

00:32:41.299 --> 00:32:51.220
as often as possible. Now, there is another important aspect. The reality is that when you work

00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:59.059
closely with brothers and sisters, you see their flaws and mistakes. So what you are going to do?

00:33:00.019 --> 00:33:07.460
Will you ignore that person? Or will you try to imitate Jehovah who is searching for the good in us?

00:33:07.460 --> 00:33:16.980
Make it a habit to search for the good and then give voice to the positive. Now, what happens

00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:28.579
to us if we are doing it that way? It can change us. It can change us from being a complainer

00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:38.420
to being a commander. A commander focuses on the good in others. He sees the others with

00:33:39.859 --> 00:33:51.900
Jehovah's eyes. A commander is very happy because he sees all the beauty around him. So if you gain

00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:59.500
a reputation for commanding rather than complaining, you will succeed in your assignment

00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:05.500
because others will love to work with you. They are soon to be graduates of the 151st class of

00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:14.059
Gilead. Please make commanding and praising others part of your personality, something that comes

00:34:14.059 --> 00:34:22.300
naturally. So how often will you go to Shiloh? Please go to Shiloh as often as possible.

00:34:27.710 --> 00:34:34.110
Well, thank you very much, Brother Glockentine. It was such a nice follow-up to Brother Losh's talk

00:34:34.110 --> 00:34:41.389
on love, and you really helped us all of us, brothers and sisters, to remember the need to encourage

00:34:41.389 --> 00:34:49.789
and repeatedly commend others. Well, this next subject seems to follow right along too, so nicely

00:34:50.590 --> 00:34:56.110
does Jehovah recognize you, and it will be delivered by Brother Luther George's

00:34:56.110 --> 00:35:04.269
a member of the U.S. Branch Committee. How do you feel when you have exerted yourself in some way

00:35:04.269 --> 00:35:12.909
and some when you deeply respect says to you, well done? Don't you feel assured that your efforts

00:35:12.909 --> 00:35:21.150
were recognized and appreciated? However, when you dear brothers and sisters in the 151st class

00:35:21.150 --> 00:35:26.269
of Gilead arrive at your assignments and you exert yourself to accomplish the work you've been

00:35:26.269 --> 00:35:34.590
given and give it yourself to encourage and help others, suppose you don't always receive an

00:35:34.590 --> 00:35:42.829
audible, well done from others. How will you feel? Does that mean that your efforts were not

00:35:42.829 --> 00:35:48.670
appreciated and recognized? To answer those questions, we're going to consider first

00:35:48.670 --> 00:35:54.190
what Jesus had to say on the subject. Second, what we can learn from some Bible examples,

00:35:54.190 --> 00:36:01.389
and third, what this means for you personally. Although the desire to receive recognition from

00:36:01.469 --> 00:36:08.750
humans is normal, Jesus helps us to have a balanced view in Matthew chapter 6. Please turn to

00:36:08.750 --> 00:36:16.670
Matthew chapter 6, and note verse 3, Matthew 6 verse 3, but you, when making gifts of mercy,

00:36:16.670 --> 00:36:23.869
do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing. Now, what did Jesus mean? Well,

00:36:23.869 --> 00:36:29.949
these gifts of mercy were really donations for needy ones, but with these words, Jesus was

00:36:29.949 --> 00:36:38.909
exhorting his disciples not to imitate the insincere religious leaders of his day, who publicize

00:36:38.909 --> 00:36:45.230
their gifts of mercy just to be recognized by humans. Now, what would be the result of heeding

00:36:45.230 --> 00:36:53.150
Jesus' words here in verse 3? Well, Jesus explains in verse 4, he says, so that your gifts of mercy

00:36:53.230 --> 00:36:59.789
may be in secret. Now, for a moment, think of the gifts of mercy, the kindnesses,

00:36:59.789 --> 00:37:06.269
the Theoretic assignments that you have performed in secret. For example, likely you've many times

00:37:06.269 --> 00:37:13.230
telephone visited an ailing brother or sister just to reassure them of your love, your concern,

00:37:13.230 --> 00:37:21.309
and even pray with them. Or perhaps you spent considerable time being a spiritual mentor to a

00:37:21.309 --> 00:37:27.550
Christian youth, or you may have given generously of yourself to encourage and provide practical

00:37:27.550 --> 00:37:36.349
assistance to a distress brother or sister. All of this you did in secret. However, Jesus said,

00:37:36.349 --> 00:37:45.949
someone you deeply respect did take note. Look there at Matthew 6 verse 4, he stayed it in the

00:37:45.949 --> 00:37:54.110
bit part, be part, your father who looks on in secret. The point is Jehovah who resides in the

00:37:54.110 --> 00:38:02.670
heavens is invisible to mankind. So he remains in secret as far as humans are concerned. But

00:38:02.670 --> 00:38:10.909
your good deeds are recognized with approval by Jehovah. Now, how can we be sure of that?

00:38:11.309 --> 00:38:18.750
Well, there are many Bible examples of faithful men and women young and old whose good deeds and

00:38:18.750 --> 00:38:26.190
heartfelt devotion were recognized with approval by Jehovah. One example is Obadaya, the household

00:38:26.190 --> 00:38:34.030
steward of Wicked King Ahab. First King, chapter 18, explains that he discreetly, secretly, secretly

00:38:34.030 --> 00:38:40.349
and cautiously hid 100 of Jehovah's prophets. So they would not be killed by Wicked Jezebel.

00:38:41.309 --> 00:38:47.789
Now, as illustrated here, Obadaya supplied them with bread and water in groups of 50

00:38:47.789 --> 00:38:55.309
in caves without being observed by others. How do we know that Jehovah in secret recognized

00:38:55.309 --> 00:39:03.230
with approval this faithful, generous, compassionate man? Well, we know because his courageous acts are

00:39:03.230 --> 00:39:11.789
recorded in the Bible for generations of people to read about. Another example is the young,

00:39:11.789 --> 00:39:19.469
nameless, isgerlite girl mentioned in 2 Kings, chapter 5. She was taken away from her God-fearing

00:39:19.469 --> 00:39:28.110
family by the Syrians. Now, as can be seen in this picture, although surrounded by false worshipers,

00:39:28.110 --> 00:39:36.750
she courageously told Nehemen's wife about Jehovah's prophet Elisha that led to Nehemen's miraculous

00:39:36.750 --> 00:39:42.909
healing of his leprosy. It led to Nehemen becoming a worshiper of Jehovah and it certainly

00:39:42.909 --> 00:39:49.710
contributed to Jehovah's praise. We don't know the name of that little girl, Dewey,

00:39:50.590 --> 00:39:57.789
but Jehovah does who in secret looked favorably on that young girl. So these two examples

00:39:57.789 --> 00:40:04.750
and many others in the scriptures are sure you that your good deeds are noted by Jehovah.

00:40:07.329 --> 00:40:15.969
Please note, though, that Jehovah does more than just look on in secret. Look again, please,

00:40:15.969 --> 00:40:24.289
at Matthew, chapter 6, verse 4. The B part, rather than its entirety, says,

00:40:24.289 --> 00:40:33.409
then your father who looks on in secret will repay you. Often, Jehovah repays us in unexpected ways,

00:40:33.409 --> 00:40:41.809
in ways that are better and more meaningful than humans could ever give us in the way of recognition.

00:40:43.170 --> 00:40:49.969
But how does Jehovah repay us? While there are many ways, we're going to focus just on three

00:40:49.969 --> 00:40:58.369
significant ones. One way is mentioned in Matthew, chapter 5, verse 7. Matthew 5, 7, Jesus said,

00:40:58.369 --> 00:41:05.010
happy other merciful since they will be shown mercy. So by our being kind and merciful,

00:41:05.010 --> 00:41:12.369
Jehovah mercifully forgives us and allows us to enjoy a warm personal relationship with him.

00:41:13.329 --> 00:41:22.369
A second way he repays us is mentioned in Mark 10, verses 29 and 30. There, Jesus promised that we

00:41:22.369 --> 00:41:29.409
would receive 100 times more than anything we sacrifice to serve Jehovah. And one resulting

00:41:29.409 --> 00:41:35.809
tangible reward that Jehovah provides is our ever-expanding loving spiritual family.

00:41:36.610 --> 00:41:42.849
A third way he repays is by means of his promise of the price, this reward, of everlasting life in

00:41:42.849 --> 00:41:50.050
God's new world. And regarding righteous ones who perform good deeds but fall asleep in death

00:41:50.769 --> 00:41:57.250
before the end of this system, Jesus and Luke chapter 14, verse 14, gave the assurance that they

00:41:57.250 --> 00:42:04.130
will be repaid in the resurrection. And then they will see the full effect of Jehovah's recognition

00:42:04.130 --> 00:42:15.119
and blessing on their good deeds. In addition to your gifts of mercy and your new assignments,

00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:25.760
your heartfelt devotion will be reflected as you with Jehovah's help, face and successfully

00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:30.639
endure various challenges, many of which others will know nothing about.

00:42:31.039 --> 00:42:38.400
But even though you may not receive recognition or a complimentary well done from others

00:42:39.039 --> 00:42:46.320
for your good deeds, your kindnesses, your sacrifices and your endurance, please remain confident

00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:53.599
that you will be recognized with approval by a loving father, Jehovah. And as Jesus promised,

00:42:54.239 --> 00:43:11.599
Jehovah who looks on in secret will repay you. Thank you very much, Brother George's, for

00:43:11.599 --> 00:43:17.920
highlighting how that no matter what happens around us, Jehovah sees and he treasures the good

00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:25.119
that we try so hard to do. Next, we have here, Brother Richard Chilton, one of the Gilead school

00:43:25.119 --> 00:43:37.469
instructors, and he will speak on the subject, who will rise up for me? I like to start by telling you

00:43:37.469 --> 00:43:45.869
an experience of a brother at Patterson Bethel. He had recently lost a loved one, a parent, in fact,

00:43:46.670 --> 00:43:53.550
and a horrible accident, and he had desperately needed to talk with someone about what he was going

00:43:53.550 --> 00:44:00.750
through and how he was feeling. He was in a word, unraveling, and he needed help.

00:44:01.230 --> 00:44:10.030
So, he called a close friend of his at Wal-Kill, Bethel, but unfortunately, the brother said that at

00:44:10.030 --> 00:44:20.030
that time, he was unable to talk. Have you ever found yourself in a similar situation that is

00:44:20.030 --> 00:44:28.829
feeling like you're drowning and in need of assistance? The psalmist did. Please read with me his

00:44:28.829 --> 00:44:41.469
words in the 94th Psalm and note his question. At Psalm 94, verse 16, the psalmist asked in part,

00:44:43.230 --> 00:44:57.789
who will rise up for me? Who will rise up for me? He goes on to answer his own question in verses 17

00:44:57.789 --> 00:45:07.550
and 19. He says, if Jehovah had not been my helper, I would have soon perished. When anxieties

00:45:07.550 --> 00:45:16.190
overwhelmed me, you, Jehovah, you comforted and soothed me. Well, when you and I send up such

00:45:16.190 --> 00:45:26.909
heartfelt prayers to Jehovah, how does he rise up for us? And how can we imitate him by rising up

00:45:26.909 --> 00:45:35.710
in behalf of others? Let's go back in time and consider an example. During the days of Israel's

00:45:35.710 --> 00:45:46.269
judges, their lived a wealthy landowner named Boaz. In obedience to Jehovah's Law, he made sure that

00:45:46.269 --> 00:45:56.829
in his fields, cleanings were left for the afflicted and poor. One day, he observes a woman working

00:45:56.989 --> 00:46:05.230
in his fields that he does not recognize. And soon he learns that she is the foreigner, Ruth,

00:46:05.230 --> 00:46:15.230
whom up to this point he has only heard about. Well, what does Boaz do? Notice how he rolls up for her

00:46:15.230 --> 00:46:24.510
at Ruth chapter 2, verse 8. Ruth chapter 2, starting with verse 8, Boaz said to Ruth,

00:46:24.989 --> 00:46:33.230
listen, my daughter, do not go away to glean in another field. And do not go anywhere else.

00:46:33.230 --> 00:46:41.869
Stay close by my young women. Keep your eyes on the field that they harvest and go with them.

00:46:42.989 --> 00:46:50.030
I have commanded the young men not to touch you. When you are thirsty, go to the water jars

00:46:50.110 --> 00:46:59.550
and drink from what the young men have drawn. Clearly, Boaz protected Ruth. He brought her under his

00:46:59.550 --> 00:47:09.789
loving care. We see him looking out for shielding, defending the one in need. And when Ruth,

00:47:09.789 --> 00:47:17.949
according to verse 10, questions his motive for helping her, a foreigner. Notice a second way.

00:47:18.590 --> 00:47:24.670
He rolls up in her behalf. Ruth chapter 2, verse 11, Boaz answered her,

00:47:26.110 --> 00:47:33.230
a full report was made to me of all you have done for your mother-in-law after the death of your

00:47:33.230 --> 00:47:42.030
husband and how you left your father and your mother and the land of your relatives to go to a

00:47:42.030 --> 00:47:49.230
people whom you had not known before. May Jehovah reward you for what you have done.

00:47:50.670 --> 00:47:56.510
And may there be a perfect wage for you from Jehovah. The God of Israel,

00:47:57.550 --> 00:48:02.670
under whose wings you have come to seek refuge. To this she said,

00:48:03.230 --> 00:48:14.750
Let me find favor in your eyes, my Lord, because you have comforted me and spoken reassuring me

00:48:15.550 --> 00:48:25.070
to your servant, although I am not even one of your servants. When Boaz spoke reassuringly to Ruth,

00:48:25.710 --> 00:48:34.670
the footnote says that he spoke to her heart. How so? His words were not just general

00:48:34.670 --> 00:48:41.469
expressions of praise. They were specific to Ruth into her personal circumstances.

00:48:42.190 --> 00:48:50.349
He reassured Ruth that Jehovah loved her for all the sacrifices she had made and she would not

00:48:50.429 --> 00:48:59.389
be forgotten. Those comforting, encouraging words of Boaz convinced Ruth that everything was going

00:48:59.389 --> 00:49:08.670
to be okay. But Boaz did more than offer reassuring words. Notice the third way he rose up.

00:49:10.030 --> 00:49:20.030
Ruth chapter 4 verse 9. By taking swift action, Boaz ensured that the inheritance of his deceased

00:49:20.030 --> 00:49:26.349
relative Alimolec would remain in their family. Chapter 4 verse 9.

00:49:27.630 --> 00:49:37.309
Boaz said to the elders and all the people, you are witnesses today that I am buying from Naomi,

00:49:37.309 --> 00:49:46.190
all that, excuse me, all that belonged to Alimolec and all that belonged to Killian and Marlon.

00:49:46.989 --> 00:49:53.150
I am also acquiring Ruth the Moabite. It's the wife of Marlon as a wife for what reason?

00:49:54.510 --> 00:50:01.710
To restore the name of the dead man to his inheritance so that the name of the dead man

00:50:02.510 --> 00:50:08.829
will not be cut off from among his brothers and from the city gate of his home. You are witnesses

00:50:08.829 --> 00:50:24.530
today. Jehovah used Boaz to rise up for Ruth and Naomi in three main ways. One, he protected those

00:50:24.530 --> 00:50:37.170
under his care. Secondly, he spoke reassuringly to them. And third, he took action. Seeing the

00:50:37.170 --> 00:50:51.489
need, it rose up to meet it. He protected, he reassured, he took action. Well, how about you and me?

00:50:52.690 --> 00:51:00.210
Should we not do the same for those in need of assistance? And what can result when we do?

00:51:02.480 --> 00:51:08.559
Well, before you answer that, let's go back to our opening experience.

00:51:10.079 --> 00:51:15.440
You see the very next morning, upon arriving at his work assignment,

00:51:16.880 --> 00:51:23.920
our distressed brother received a phone call from the Patterson lobby. It was the brother,

00:51:24.880 --> 00:51:33.119
the friend from Wallkill. He had gotten up early that morning, had driven over an hour

00:51:33.119 --> 00:51:40.480
from the Wallkill complex to reach the Patterson complex by 8 a.m. He had arranged for a private

00:51:40.480 --> 00:51:49.760
conference room and he was there waiting for that distressed friend so he could find out how can I

00:51:49.760 --> 00:52:00.960
help. That was 22 years ago, but I can tell you now, I have never forgotten what that friend did

00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:10.320
for me when he rose up for me on that day. By means of the action that he took, I felt reassured,

00:52:10.960 --> 00:52:23.280
I felt protected, I felt loved. So the question for you 24 students, in fact the question for all of

00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:33.440
us in our hearing audience is this, what will you do to rise up for someone in need? We have every

00:52:33.440 --> 00:52:41.599
confidence that each and every one of you will answer that call when it comes saying, here I am,

00:52:42.480 --> 00:52:55.630
I will rise up for you. How can I help? Thank you so much, brother Cholten. We appreciated that

00:52:55.630 --> 00:53:03.710
reassurance that when we rise up to help others, Jehovah will love us for it and others will rise up

00:53:04.190 --> 00:53:11.150
and turn for us. Next, we have another instructor from the Gilded School, brother Trent Lippold,

00:53:11.869 --> 00:53:21.630
and his theme is a question, will I be more? The Apostle Paul was not a man given to boasting,

00:53:22.349 --> 00:53:29.630
but on one occasion he felt compelled to boast a little. And that account is found for us in the book

00:53:29.630 --> 00:53:37.309
of 2 Corinthians chapter 11. Please read with me 2 Corinthians chapter 11 and verse 23,

00:53:41.119 --> 00:53:51.900
are they ministers of Christ? I reply like a madman. I am more outstandingly one. What was the

00:53:51.900 --> 00:54:00.619
subject of Paul's boast? Being a minister of Christ. And now being a minister of Christ,

00:54:00.619 --> 00:54:10.699
what was Paul's focus in this boast? He said, I am more outstandingly one. William Tyndale,

00:54:10.699 --> 00:54:16.219
when he translated this verse, he kept the very terseness and the clarity of the Greek,

00:54:16.219 --> 00:54:26.260
when he simply said, I am more. That's Paul's boast. What is he focusing on, though, as a minister

00:54:26.260 --> 00:54:34.739
of Christ in his boast? He said, I have done more work. And now from verses 23 through 27,

00:54:34.739 --> 00:54:44.019
he gives almost a resume of what happened to him because of the work Paul did as a minister of Christ.

00:54:46.019 --> 00:54:54.500
Well, how will your properly focusing on your work as a minister of Christ help you to succeed in

00:54:54.500 --> 00:55:01.619
your assignments? Let's consider an example. And it's found in the book of Luke chapter 8.

00:55:03.699 --> 00:55:14.429
Luke chapter 8 verses 1 through 3. Shortly afterward, he, this is Christ,

00:55:15.150 --> 00:55:20.030
traveled from city to city and from village to village, preaching and declaring the good news of

00:55:20.030 --> 00:55:27.309
the kingdom of God. And the 12 were with him, as were certain women who had been cured of wicked

00:55:27.309 --> 00:55:34.510
spirits and sicknesses, Mary, who was called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had come out,

00:55:35.869 --> 00:55:45.389
Joanna, the wife of Kusa, herdsman in charge, Susanna, and many other women who were ministering

00:55:45.389 --> 00:56:00.909
to them from their belongings. A group, Christ, the 12, and women, women who ministered to the others.

00:56:00.909 --> 00:56:05.710
What did that mean? Did it mean they cooked the meals, washed the dishes, mended the clothes?

00:56:06.670 --> 00:56:15.789
Possibly, but not necessarily entirely that. These women ministered to the others by helping them to

00:56:15.789 --> 00:56:22.269
complete their assignment, as they went on completing their assignment as disciples of Christ.

00:56:24.349 --> 00:56:29.710
Notice the backgrounds of these women. Luke mentions 3. He says,

00:56:30.510 --> 00:56:35.630
their women who were cured of wicked spirits and sicknesses, look at Mary. Mary, he says,

00:56:35.630 --> 00:56:43.630
from whom seven demons had come out. He also mentions Joanna, the wife of Kusa, herdsman in charge,

00:56:44.590 --> 00:56:51.309
and Susanna. Think of their backgrounds. Mary, seven demons came out of her. I wonder how that

00:56:51.309 --> 00:56:59.150
demon possession contributed to her personality. What about Joanna? Joanna, it says,

00:56:59.710 --> 00:57:06.750
the wife of Kusa, herdsman in charge. In other words, Joanna lived in herds palace. She was a woman

00:57:06.750 --> 00:57:15.869
of the court, and also Susanna. It doesn't say specifically much about her other than perhaps she

00:57:15.869 --> 00:57:22.590
was one of the women who was cured of a sickness. What was her personality like? How did these

00:57:22.590 --> 00:57:30.429
personalities work together? Here's part of the example of what can help us to minister.

00:57:31.469 --> 00:57:36.190
And that is to realize, when we look through the gospel accounts, we never find

00:57:37.150 --> 00:57:42.349
these women bickering or arguing amongst themselves about position or prominence or place,

00:57:43.710 --> 00:57:53.199
unlike some others in the group that were with them. Why? Because these women focused on their

00:57:53.199 --> 00:57:59.519
ministry. They focused on their work. They served others, and they served each other.

00:58:00.639 --> 00:58:09.119
And that is a powerful example for you and for me. Remember, in Isaiah chapter 11, verse 6,

00:58:09.119 --> 00:58:16.960
it's prophesied, the wolf will reside with the lamb, lions with calves. It's not going to be all

00:58:16.960 --> 00:58:25.599
lambs. You will meet diverse personalities in your assignments, and you will have to work with

00:58:25.599 --> 00:58:33.599
diverse personalities, just like the women did. So what will you do? Remember that some of the very

00:58:33.599 --> 00:58:41.119
qualities that make a lion or make a wolf might be exactly the qualities you need to help you

00:58:41.119 --> 00:58:48.000
fulfill your assignment. So they're not all lambs, but they all are our brothers and sisters.

00:58:49.519 --> 00:58:55.440
So if Jehovah allows a diversity of personalities within the context of the new personality,

00:58:56.159 --> 00:59:01.119
then so should we. Diverse personalities make for rich friendships.

00:59:03.739 --> 00:59:08.219
You know, Luke wrote these words in about, or he's talking about events that took place around

00:59:08.300 --> 00:59:17.820
the Passover of 31 CE. When you think of these women, these women were with Jesus at Golgotha.

00:59:18.619 --> 00:59:24.860
These women were at the tomb. Likely, these women may have been in the upper room as well.

00:59:25.739 --> 00:59:32.860
That tells us that these women endured challenging circumstances. They stuck with the Lord.

00:59:32.860 --> 00:59:41.019
What helped them? Look back at the verse, verse two. As were certain women who had been cured

00:59:41.019 --> 00:59:49.019
of wicked spirits and sicknesses, these women deeply appreciated what Jesus had done for them.

00:59:50.940 --> 00:59:57.179
Certainly, they glorified God because of what Jesus had done for them, but they also allowed

00:59:57.179 --> 01:00:04.539
their appreciation to help them endure, to endure in a self-sacrifice in life of ministering to

01:00:04.539 --> 01:00:16.210
others. So stay appreciative, and that will help you endure. Our friends are dying. Our friends

01:00:16.210 --> 01:00:27.170
are getting sick. Meditate on how Jehovah has blessed you. Meditate on the little things each day.

01:00:27.889 --> 01:00:34.929
The little gifts Jehovah gives you. Maybe it's simply the peace in your heart and mind this day.

01:00:36.050 --> 01:00:41.730
Remain appreciative for that, and that will help you endure as a minister in your assignment.

01:00:43.980 --> 01:00:49.260
One other thing that's noteworthy about these women is that these women were not easily thrown off

01:00:49.260 --> 01:00:55.099
by others. Remember, we said we talked about others, the other disciples. When other disciples left

01:00:55.179 --> 01:01:04.269
Christ, the women stayed. At Golgotha, even the apostles, to a certain degree had left Christ,

01:01:04.269 --> 01:01:13.570
or fled, the women stayed. They stood solidly on their own faith. Brothers and sisters,

01:01:13.570 --> 01:01:19.170
do not be thrown off easily by others. Sometimes, and you can imagine for these women with the

01:01:19.170 --> 01:01:26.449
disciples, it felt like a family. And sometimes today, in families, ones choose to leave Jehovah,

01:01:26.449 --> 01:01:35.170
even at this late hour, stand solidly on your own faith. Like the women, do not be easily thrown off,

01:01:35.170 --> 01:01:42.019
stay with Jehovah. These women must have made quite an impression on Luke, because he's the only

01:01:42.019 --> 01:01:49.219
gospel writer who mentions them by name in this way. An interestingly Luke was a traveling companion

01:01:49.219 --> 01:01:53.780
of Paul from about 50 CE in Troas. He picked up with Paul and started traveling with him, and he

01:01:53.780 --> 01:02:00.579
traveled with him for years. I wonder if they spoke together. I wonder if they spoke about these women.

01:02:01.780 --> 01:02:08.260
I wonder if they talked about how important it is to focus on the work of ministering and not to

01:02:08.260 --> 01:02:14.980
get distracted by other things. I wonder if they talked about the value of preserving unity

01:02:16.340 --> 01:02:23.059
by learning to work with different personalities. Did they talk about the power of appreciation to

01:02:23.059 --> 01:02:31.699
endure? We don't know, but what we do know is this, when Paul was in prison in Rome, and he wrote his

01:02:31.699 --> 01:02:38.019
letter to the Hebrews, the congregation in Judea and Jerusalem, Luke was with him. Do you remember what

01:02:38.019 --> 01:02:43.460
Paul wrote in Hebrews 6 verse 10? He said, God is not unrighteous, so as to forget your work and the

01:02:43.460 --> 01:02:54.099
love you showed to his name by ministering. Jehovah did not forget these women, and Jehovah will not

01:02:54.099 --> 01:03:01.059
forget you. May you work hard to put into practice the things that you have learned,

01:03:02.659 --> 01:03:09.139
and may you be able to say that you are more outstandingly a minister of Christ.

01:03:16.719 --> 01:03:21.440
Well, thank you very much, Brother Lippold, for those scriptural examples. We are more determined

01:03:21.440 --> 01:03:30.159
to focus on our work as ministers of the Christ. What a delightful program. And that was only the

01:03:30.159 --> 01:03:41.679
first part. Later this month, parts 2 and 3 will be available on jw.org, so be sure to tune in.

01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:50.079
In this month's video postcard, we are visiting the islands of Sautomé and Principe.

01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:59.119
On a world map, they look like tiny spots located in the Gulf of Guinea off the western coast of Africa.

01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:08.960
The rainy, humid climate in Sautomé and Principe produces luxurious rain forests covering the

01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:19.039
slopes of mountains that can rise to over 2,000 meters or 6,600 feet. These tropical islands are

01:04:19.039 --> 01:04:27.760
surrounded by palm-fringed beaches. The residents are often gifted with amazing sunsets.

01:04:28.239 --> 01:04:38.480
The people of Sautomé and Principe are hardworking, often washing their clothes in the Abad river.

01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:48.300
Many have worked related to palm trees, which includes palm oil, palm wine,

01:04:49.900 --> 01:04:55.500
and handicraft production. And we can see that it is hard work.

01:04:56.300 --> 01:05:04.380
Their delicious cuisine is based on a wide variety of fruits such as guava, passion fruit,

01:05:04.380 --> 01:05:13.420
papaya, mango, as well as seafood dishes. But there is another work taking place on Sautomé and

01:05:13.420 --> 01:05:22.699
Principe. These friendly and warm-hearted people have a deep appreciation for God's word.

01:05:23.579 --> 01:05:27.980
And it is customary to see them reading the Bible on their balconies.

01:05:30.139 --> 01:05:37.659
During the pandemic, the brothers and sisters adapted their preaching work by writing letters

01:05:37.659 --> 01:05:47.099
and delivering them as conditions permit. The 933 publishers in the 14 congregations

01:05:47.659 --> 01:05:57.099
are conducting 1,705 Bible studies, and baptisms continued throughout the pandemic.

01:05:58.780 --> 01:06:05.659
Because of the high cost of internet access, some of our brothers and sisters,

01:06:05.659 --> 01:06:13.260
along with other interested ones, can attend the meetings, the memorial, and conventions,

01:06:14.139 --> 01:06:23.019
by means of the only local TV channel. Thanks to this arrangement, many Bible studies are

01:06:23.019 --> 01:06:34.699
requested every week. What was the memorial attendance in 2021? The attendance was 5,794,

01:06:34.699 --> 01:06:42.139
which is more than six times the number of publishers. Here are some of your fellow brothers and

01:06:42.139 --> 01:06:52.380
sisters from the South Marsal congregation. The 131 publishers there conduct 190 Bible studies.

01:06:52.380 --> 01:06:59.980
The happy and loyal brothers and sisters from South Marsal and all from Sautomé and Principe

01:06:59.980 --> 01:07:10.300
send their love and greetings. And we send our love back to all of them. Thank you for joining us

01:07:10.300 --> 01:07:19.420
this month. From the World Headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses, this is JW Broadcasting.
