00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:04.910
Have you ever made a bad decision?

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:07.910
Maybe a better question would be,

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.910
do you remember the last bad decision that you made?

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:18.910
Most of our decisions don't impact our lives greatly.

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.910
The young brother mentioned to me some time ago,

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:24.910
when he looked at my tie,

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.910
you have some work to do, Brother Hayet.

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.740
Well, maybe that was a bad decision.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:40.210
But some decisions impact our sacred service

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.210
and our relationship with Jehovah.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.210
And that's highlighted in today's text.

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.210
When viewed in their context,

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.210
we quickly discern that the words of today's text

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.210
were not given as commendation,

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.210
or even as reassurance.

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.210
But we're given in the context of corrective counsel.

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.209
Now, who was being counseled?

00:01:07.209 --> 00:01:12.209
King Asa, the great, great grandson of King David,

00:01:12.209 --> 00:01:17.209
the third king of the kingdom of Judah.

00:01:17.209 --> 00:01:20.209
He ruled for 41 years,

00:01:20.209 --> 00:01:23.209
and he has the distinction of being known

00:01:23.209 --> 00:01:27.209
as one of the faithful kings of Judah.

00:01:28.209 --> 00:01:32.209
So with that in mind, the question arises,

00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:38.209
why would a faithful king need corrective counsel?

00:01:38.209 --> 00:01:41.209
To answer the question, let's turn in our Bibles

00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:45.209
to 2 Chronicles chapter 167.

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:48.209
At that time, Haneinai, the seer,

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:52.209
came to King Asa of Judah and said to him,

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:57.209
because you relied on the king of Syria

00:01:57.209 --> 00:02:02.209
and did not rely on Jehovah your God.

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:07.209
So there was the bottom line, the root of the problem.

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:12.210
The army of the king of Syria has escaped out of your hand.

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:18.210
And then Haneinai reminds Asa of an earlier event.

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:23.580
He asks, were not the Ethiopians and the Libyans

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.580
a very great army with many chariots and horsemen?

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.580
But because you relied on Jehovah,

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.580
he gave them into your hand.

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.580
Well, sometime earlier, Asa and the nation of Judah

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.580
were confronted by Zira, the Ethiopian,

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.580
and one million troops.

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.580
How did Asa handle that crisis?

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.580
Well, he humbly prayed to Jehovah

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.580
and put himself in the nation in Jehovah's hands,

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.580
and Jehovah was favorably impressed with that approach

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.539
and he gave Judah the victory.

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:13.539
Now, in this case, when King Ben Hadad came against Judah,

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:16.539
rather than relying on Jehovah,

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:21.539
Asa bribed Ben Hadad.

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:24.539
So it was Beasha who came from Israel.

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:27.539
He bribed King Ben Hadad

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:29.539
and it seemed to be successful.

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:31.539
Ben Hadad came against Beasha.

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:34.539
Beasha withdrew from Judah.

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:36.539
All was well.

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:39.539
Except that Jehovah wasn't pleased.

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:45.939
Asa left Jehovah out of the equation.

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:48.939
So with that in mind, in verse nine,

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:50.939
we have the council, don't we?

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:52.939
For the eyes of Jehovah are roving about

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:55.939
through all the earth to show his strength

00:03:55.939 --> 00:04:00.939
in behalf of those whose heart is complete toward him.

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:03.939
You have acted foolishly in this matter.

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:07.939
From now on, there will be wars against you.

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:13.669
So there was the reminder and the council.

00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:17.670
Now, why, when confronted with one million,

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:20.670
did Asa depend on Jehovah?

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:24.670
But when confronted by King Beasha of Israel,

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:27.670
he depended on himself.

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:30.670
Isn't it true that when we face a situation,

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:33.670
a problem, a decision must be made?

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:38.670
But the situation is so much bigger than we are.

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:42.670
We turn to Jehovah and we beg for his help

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:46.670
for solace and comfort and direction.

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:49.670
It may be a catastrophic illness that we know

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:52.670
isn't going to be resolved in this system.

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:56.670
Could be the death of someone close to us,

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:59.670
or perhaps a family member, or a close friend

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:01.670
is disfellowship.

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:04.670
We have no control over the situation,

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:07.670
and we lean on Jehovah.

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:11.670
But other decisions may seem to be more within our grasp,

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:15.670
for example, the selection of a marriage made,

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:19.670
the choice of a career.

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:25.670
Maybe we came to work here and to help with construction.

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:28.670
We might have sold our home, cut our ties,

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:32.670
and now a project is nearing completion,

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:34.670
and we have to make decisions.

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:37.670
Will we go back where we came from?

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:41.670
We weren't pioneering before we came,

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:45.670
but now after spending some time here at Bethel,

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:47.670
we're thinking about spiritual goals.

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:49.670
Can we pioneer?

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:52.670
Should we stay in this country?

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:58.240
Is it possible we could move to another country?

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:01.240
If we're not careful as we make these decisions,

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:06.240
we could leave Jehovah out of the equation.

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.240
So here's a question.

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:13.240
How do we include Jehovah in the equation?

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:16.240
Well, there are three things that we can do.

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:19.240
The first is research.

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:22.240
What does Jehovah tell us in his word

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:27.240
that has application to the situation we're facing?

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:33.240
What has the faithful and discreet slave told us in the publications?

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:37.240
Has there been an article, some direction,

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:40.240
that would be helpful to us?

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:45.240
A second ingredient is that of prayer,

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:49.240
talking with Jehovah about the decision that we're making.

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:52.240
And keeping in mind that we don't expect Jehovah

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:55.240
to do our thinking for us,

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:58.240
but he will help us and direct us

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:02.240
so that we can make a good decision.

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:06.240
And finally, here in the Bethel setting,

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:11.240
and in the congregations we have a wealth of experienced,

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:16.240
faithful brothers and sisters who would be more than happy

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:22.240
to help us benefit from their experience in life.

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.240
So if we do these three things,

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:29.240
our research, prayer, and talking with experienced,

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:34.240
faithful ones, then we can make a good decision.

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:40.240
Now, here's the question, what is a good decision?

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:44.240
Wouldn't you agree that ultimately a good decision

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:47.240
is one that Jehovah can bless?

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:49.240
And often we have a number of options

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:52.240
and it's not necessarily a question

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:55.240
of making a wrong or right decision,

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:58.240
but what decision, what can we do

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:01.240
that will enhance our relationship with Jehovah

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:05.240
and give him something to bless?

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:08.240
Now, there's one other point in the account

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:11.240
that can be very encouraging to us.

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:15.240
If you look back at 2 Chronicles 15,

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:20.800
and the B portion of verse 17,

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:22.800
it says, nevertheless,

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:28.800
Aces, heart, was complete all his life.

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:30.800
That's interesting, isn't it?

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:32.799
Now, in our text for today,

00:08:32.799 --> 00:08:35.799
we're told that Jehovah is searching for those

00:08:35.799 --> 00:08:39.799
whose heart is complete toward him.

00:08:39.799 --> 00:08:41.799
Ultimately, Jehovah viewed Aces

00:08:41.799 --> 00:08:45.799
as one whose heart was complete.

00:08:45.799 --> 00:08:47.799
It's comforting to know that Jehovah

00:08:47.799 --> 00:08:49.799
did not measure the man

00:08:49.799 --> 00:08:53.799
because of one faulty decision.

00:08:53.799 --> 00:08:55.799
He looked at the whole picture

00:08:55.799 --> 00:08:58.799
and evidently Aces good qualities

00:08:58.799 --> 00:09:03.799
and his zeal for pure worship outweighed

00:09:03.799 --> 00:09:06.799
the bad decision that he made in this case.

00:09:06.799 --> 00:09:08.799
So when we make bad decisions

00:09:08.799 --> 00:09:10.799
and we will from time to time,

00:09:10.799 --> 00:09:12.799
then we take comfort in knowing

00:09:12.799 --> 00:09:16.799
that Jehovah will continue to work with us.

00:09:16.799 --> 00:09:18.799
And ultimately, what we want

00:09:18.799 --> 00:09:21.799
is for Jehovah to look at each of us

00:09:21.799 --> 00:09:24.799
and to say his or her heart

00:09:24.799 --> 00:09:27.799
is complete with me.
