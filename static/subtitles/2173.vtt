00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:11.310
When you believe in creation, what challenges might you face?

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:15.310
My favorite subject was science,

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:17.309
because I learned facts about how things are connected.

00:00:17.309 --> 00:00:19.309
I thought that was really exciting,

00:00:19.309 --> 00:00:22.309
seeing how the physical world works.

00:00:22.309 --> 00:00:25.309
But then you come to a topic like evolution,

00:00:25.309 --> 00:00:28.309
and you immediately know that there's something here

00:00:28.309 --> 00:00:30.309
that's not quite right.

00:00:30.309 --> 00:00:33.310
In 5th grade, when I was around 12,

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.310
we had science, my worst subject.

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:39.310
The teacher was fully convinced that we descended from apes

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.310
and that the evolution theory is the truth.

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:48.310
You realize that you're probably the only one in that room thinking

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:50.310
this is not true.

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:54.310
Then you might start questioning yourself.

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:56.310
Is the teacher wrong?

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:00.310
Or have I maybe believed something wrong my whole life?

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:05.310
It's a little challenging being alone in such a situation.

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.010
What helped you to build your faith in a creator?

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:14.010
I spent a lot of time on the bus,

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.010
two in from school, reading JW.org,

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:20.010
and the five questions brochure,

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:24.010
actually, to make up my mind on what I believe in.

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:27.010
I did a lot of research when I got home that evening,

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:30.010
and my parents helped me search on our website.

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.010
And what helped me the most was the video,

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:35.010
what your peers say, belief in God.

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:38.010
I remember one small scene that stuck with me.

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.010
It was a glass bottle that was pulled up from the sand.

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.010
Yes, it's made of the same material,

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.010
but it definitely didn't form by itself.

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:49.010
There has to be someone that turns it into a glass bottle.

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.010
And I found that very logical.

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.010
It really convinced me that there is a creator.

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:59.010
I remember there are three things necessary for life.

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:03.010
I learned it was RNA, DNA, and proteins.

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.010
If they were to exist at the same place,

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.009
and at the same time, that would be very rare.

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.009
And on top of that, it would be as if those three things

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:15.009
then should team up and say,

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:17.009
we would like to create life.

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:19.009
A cell that in turn would become an animal,

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:22.009
a person, or many other things.

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:25.009
This made me realize that believing this

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:27.009
would require even more faith

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:31.009
than believing that there is a God who has created everything.

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:34.009
So, I sent a text message to my teacher

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:37.009
with my viewpoints about me believing in a creator

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:40.009
and added a link to the video.

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:45.009
He then asked if it was okay if I showed the video to the class.

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:48.009
And I said, of course,

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:50.009
I watched the video so many times

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:52.009
that I knew all who lines by heart

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:56.009
and knew exactly which scene came one and where.

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:58.009
So that if someone in the class had any questions,

00:02:58.009 --> 00:03:00.009
I would know the answer.

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:04.009
The last five minutes, I got to appear in front of the class,

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:06.009
explained a little about Jehovah's Witnesses

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:08.009
and that we believe in a creator,

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:11.009
and said I had a video that convinced me of that.

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:13.009
And when I was about to press start,

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:15.009
the bell rang for a break.

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:19.009
But everyone stayed in the classroom to watch the video.

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:21.009
I thought that was really fun.

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:25.009
How does having faith in a loving creator help you?

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:29.009
It makes everything more meaningful.

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:33.009
You're not thinking, here I am,

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:37.009
I'll just live the way I do till I die.

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:38.009
And that's it.

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:41.009
You believe that there is a purpose to life

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:45.009
and it also opens the possibility of a hope for the future.

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:47.009
Around us, there are so many people

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:50.009
who have different views and theories

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:54.009
and that can have a big impact on us.

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:56.009
So if you don't have a strong faith,

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:59.009
then someone can pick away at your faith

00:03:59.009 --> 00:04:02.009
and try to break it down.

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:04.009
Yes, I am very grateful

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:07.009
that my parents taught me about creation.

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:10.009
So I always knew that there is a loving father out there

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:13.009
who has created all the beautiful things for us.

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:15.009
You can just go out into nature.

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:16.009
The sun is shining.

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:19.009
Look at all the beautiful colors and autumn.

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:20.009
It's so nice.

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:23.009
And all we can do is really just be grateful.

00:04:24.009 --> 00:04:28.009
Now I am 100% convinced that creation,

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:30.009
it is a fact.

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:32.009
That's how it must have begun.
