00:00:01.229 --> 00:00:12.250
Now, there is a saying that war can't kill love, but love can kill war, and Jehovah's Witnesses

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:19.809
truly exemplify that saying, all of man's horrible wars have not killed off the love of

00:00:19.809 --> 00:00:28.690
Jehovah's people, in fact made it stronger, and yet their love has killed off war among

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:32.909
their ranks and even from within their hearts.

00:00:32.909 --> 00:00:41.009
1 John 3, 10-12, in essence says, the children of God and the children of the devil are evident

00:00:41.009 --> 00:00:42.929
by this fact.

00:00:42.929 --> 00:00:46.450
The children of God love their brothers.

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:52.090
The children of the devil slaughter their brothers like Cain slaughtered his brother.

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:58.729
But you know, sometimes in the ministry and in other places, when we try to bring up our

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:05.930
stand regarding not participating in war, our Christian neutrality, people bring up the

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:07.810
objection about the Israelites.

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:13.569
They'll say, well, they were God's people, they fought war, so why can't Christians fight

00:01:13.569 --> 00:01:14.569
in wars?

00:01:14.569 --> 00:01:16.689
How do you deal with that argument?

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.090
Well, if you're going to overcome that, you obviously have to show them there's a vast

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:28.810
difference between the Israelites and Bible times and true Christians today.

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.569
In fact, let's briefly discuss five differences.

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:40.129
1. In the days of the Israelites, God's people were gathered into one nation.

00:01:40.129 --> 00:01:44.849
So when they went into battle against the pagan nations, they weren't killing fellow

00:01:44.849 --> 00:01:45.849
believers.

00:01:45.849 --> 00:01:47.650
They weren't killing their brothers.

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:55.170
But today, Revelation 7.9 says that the great crowd of true Christians is scattered in

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.209
all nations, tribes, peoples, and tongues.

00:01:59.209 --> 00:02:04.329
So if Christians participated in war today, what would happen?

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:08.210
We would end up killing fellow believers, our brothers.

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:13.569
And of course, we know that it's happening among ones who claim to be God's people who

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.490
take up the sword.

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:20.409
We find Catholic killing their fellow Catholics.

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:27.289
We find the same thing among the Methodists, the Baptist, Muslims, slaughtering members

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:28.770
of their own religion.

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:36.050
Makes me think of a conversation I had many years ago with a high-ranking Mormon elder.

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.930
And I ask him, I said, well, what is your position on war?

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.449
We don't like war.

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:42.449
I said, what do you do, though?

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:48.169
If you're living in a country at a time, there's a draft, you're drafted into the military.

00:02:48.169 --> 00:02:51.810
He said, well, if the government makes this do it, it's their responsibility.

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.250
We go ahead and fight.

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:59.129
I said, do you then kill another Mormon on the battlefield?

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:02.370
Because I know you have Mormons in many different countries.

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.330
He said, well, if I knew he was a Mormon, I'd let him go.

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:12.210
I said, but normally, it's not possible to check with each person before you shoot

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:13.210
it.

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:19.889
Well, he didn't admit it, but obviously he got the point that was made there.

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:27.530
But now, let's go to our second difference, Jehovah God, who can read hearts, personally

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:34.490
judged as worthy of execution the people the Israelites went up against.

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:43.250
He directly told them to execute his judgment on these demon worshipping people whose worship

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:48.250
included gross sexual immorality, even child sacrifice.

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.449
Open up to Leviticus chapter 18, please.

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:57.770
And notice an example of Jehovah telling the Israelites concerning the Canaanites.

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:59.770
Now, here's what he said.

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:08.810
Because 18 verse 24, Jehovah says, do not make yourselves unclean by any of these things,

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:16.970
for it is by all these things that the nations that I am driving out from before you have

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:19.810
made themselves unclean.

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:26.569
Therefore the land is unclean, and I will bring punishment on it for its error.

00:04:26.569 --> 00:04:31.089
And the land will vomit its inhabitants out.

00:04:31.089 --> 00:04:36.050
So Jehovah told them to execute his judgment on these people.

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:37.730
Now here's our third difference.

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:43.769
The Israelites were killed selectively, and we have just two examples of many that could

00:04:43.769 --> 00:04:44.769
be related.

00:04:44.769 --> 00:04:54.930
A Joshua chapter 6 shows that Rahab and her entire household were miraculously spared.

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:55.930
Why?

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:59.250
Because Rahab exercised faith in Jehovah.

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:02.449
Or what about Joshua chapter 9 and 10?

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:09.089
Talks about how Jehovah spared the Canaan or the Ghibbianites who were actually in line

00:05:09.089 --> 00:05:14.050
for destruction because they exercised faith in Jehovah.

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:16.129
Now it's just a couple of examples.

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:22.370
But in today's wars are people spared because of their obedience and faith?

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:23.370
No.

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:28.810
Often the civilian casualties are greater than the soldier casualties when they drop their

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:30.370
bombs.

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:38.889
The collateral damage, as they call it, often results in substantial death of innocent people.

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:41.009
Let's get our fourth difference now.

00:05:41.009 --> 00:05:48.209
The Israelites' soldiers were required to conduct their warfare according to Jehovah's

00:05:48.209 --> 00:05:49.209
guidelines.

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:54.250
Now here are just a few examples of Jehovah's guidelines of many that could be related.

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:57.810
Open up to Deuteronomy chapter 23, please.

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:05.930
Deuteronomy 23, and notice what Jehovah told the Israelites, army, the soldiers.

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:13.649
Deuteronomy 23, beginning of verse 9, when you are entamped against your enemies, you should

00:06:13.649 --> 00:06:16.129
avoid anything bad.

00:06:16.129 --> 00:06:17.810
Look at verse 12.

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:22.009
A private place should be designated for use outside the camp.

00:06:22.009 --> 00:06:25.050
They would go out there and relieve themselves.

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:26.370
See, why?

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:28.490
Look at verse 14.

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:37.050
For Jehovah your God is walking about within your camp to deliver you and to hand over

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:44.009
your enemies to you and your camp must be holy so that he does not see anything indecent

00:06:44.009 --> 00:06:47.370
in you and turn away from accompanying you.

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:55.209
Yes, Jehovah required cleanliness among these Israelites' soldiers because actually they

00:06:55.209 --> 00:06:58.209
were sanctified for warfare.

00:06:58.209 --> 00:07:02.050
But now, what about soldiers today?

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:03.529
Obviously, very different.

00:07:03.529 --> 00:07:11.209
In fact, the Insight book talks about how they were certainly not allowed to rape any of

00:07:11.209 --> 00:07:14.329
the conquered city's women.

00:07:14.329 --> 00:07:18.569
In fact, they couldn't even marry such a woman for one month.

00:07:18.569 --> 00:07:23.089
Page 173 of the Insight book, you can get a lot of Jehovah's guidelines that he gave

00:07:23.089 --> 00:07:25.050
to the Israelites' soldiers.

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:33.610
But now, one more difference, Jehovah thought with the Israelites giving them miraculous

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:34.610
victories.

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:38.810
And again, we'll just give two examples of many that could be related.

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:41.050
How is the Battle of Jericho?

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:42.050
What?

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:43.050
Who are the priests?

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:44.050
Blue horns.

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:46.329
The military force marched.

00:07:46.329 --> 00:07:51.730
The army shouted and the walls fell flat.

00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:53.649
Jehovah gave them that victory.

00:07:53.649 --> 00:08:02.889
Or what about the victory of the Gibbianites, the victory over the kings that attacked them?

00:08:02.889 --> 00:08:12.170
Joshua 1011 says, Jehovah hurled great hailstones from the sky so that more died from the

00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:15.370
hill than from the sword of the Israelites.

00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:19.569
Well, unlike today, Jehovah fought with the Israelites.

00:08:19.569 --> 00:08:21.730
So there we have five differences.

00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:27.889
In the days of the Israelites, see, unlike today, God's people were gathered in one nation.

00:08:27.889 --> 00:08:31.250
So they didn't go up against their brothers when they went into war.

00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:36.049
And secondly, Jehovah personally judged those executed as worthy of such.

00:08:36.049 --> 00:08:42.169
A third, the Israelites' wars were killing only selectively.

00:08:42.169 --> 00:08:47.409
And four, the Israelites' soldiers were required to conduct their warfare according to Jehovah's

00:08:47.409 --> 00:08:49.730
strict guidelines.

00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:57.769
And number five, Jehovah fought with the Israelites, giving them miraculous victories.

00:08:57.769 --> 00:09:03.169
So you could truly say that the Israelites' wars were holy wars.

00:09:03.169 --> 00:09:07.929
But the wars of today's wicked world are anything but holy.

00:09:07.929 --> 00:09:14.809
No wonder Jesus said that theocratic warfare would no longer include the use of physical

00:09:14.809 --> 00:09:15.809
weapons.

00:09:15.809 --> 00:09:19.690
Remember what he said in Matthew 26, 52?

00:09:19.690 --> 00:09:26.450
He said, those that take up the sword will die perished by the sword.

00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:32.889
And he taught his followers not to harm their enemies, in fact to even pray for them.

00:09:32.889 --> 00:09:40.250
And his position, of course, is in harmony with Jehovah's prophecy at Isaiah 2, 2-4, that

00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:47.929
in the final part of the days, God's people would beat their swords into plowshares, and

00:09:47.929 --> 00:09:54.169
they would not even learn war anymore, much less participate in it.
