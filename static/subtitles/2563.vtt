00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:16.019
My name's Eden. We're going to see Uncle Tony and Aunt Yana. They are helping to build the new

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:21.059
Bethlehem Britain at a chance for construction site. They've been given special permission to

00:00:21.059 --> 00:00:27.699
show us around. So you can see how a Bethlehem is built. Are you ready to get going?

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:57.179
Yeah. Well these two buildings up there on the hill there are the production buildings. This one

00:00:57.179 --> 00:01:01.579
right in front of us that's the office building and then these ones down the hill. They're all

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:06.939
the residences for the Bethelites. It takes years of work before you can even start building a

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:18.799
Bethel. So do you want to know what the first step is? Yeah. Okay come with me. This is the office

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:24.480
where the design is right. Hello my name's Dan. What's your name? One inch river. My name's Eden.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.640
Oh it's really nice to meet you both. So this is a design office. The brothers tell us what they

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:35.519
want. We work out how to build it. So why do you build these models? Mark Stacy you got a second

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:41.200
but maybe they can explain what that's happening in this model. When you make a model like this

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.359
you really get an idea of what the landscape will look like how things are looking

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:57.230
they're setting and how you build it. It's really clever isn't it? Yeah. Of course to build buildings

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:16.860
this big we need big machines. Pre-pory, river, Eden. Hello and Eden nice to meet you. How much can

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:25.659
the truck carry? It can carry 25 times. Wow that's like three elephants. Isn't it hard to drive?

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:34.539
Sometimes it can be if I'm in a very tight spot. Would you recommend driving the massive truck?

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:46.180
Most definitely. Now this is the most important department on the panel project. Would you like to come

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:55.599
and see the kitchen? Yeah. Okay let's go. Wow it's really big. Quite heavy flex.

00:02:56.159 --> 00:03:35.150
Before we go guys, river, Eden, this is Brother Luke G.A. How nice to meet you. I hear you had a

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:40.189
tour today. Yeah it's really good. Oh that's great and I understand you have some questions for me.

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:48.430
So let's go someplace where we can talk about that okay? Okay let's go this way. Okay so you

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:53.710
had some questions. What's your first one? What is it like working with your friends? Oh that is

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:58.669
the best thing. So every day you look forward to coming in because you're going to get to be with

00:03:58.669 --> 00:04:05.150
your friends. How does Jehovah help you with your job? Oh Jehovah helps us so much with our job.

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:11.150
So for me personally he helps me keep calm because when I think about all the work that we have

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:17.149
in supporting the governing body they have so much work to do. Seeing how Jehovah takes a group of

00:04:17.149 --> 00:04:22.350
volunteers, brothers and sisters who are doing this just because they want to and they come work

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:28.029
together and to see how they accomplish it is the most incredible thing. That's my favorite part

00:04:28.029 --> 00:04:34.910
of every project. Yeah. How many prayers do you think you've said? I can't even count how many

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:39.790
many prayers and it's only with Jehovah's help that we get it done. It's not because of us.

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:46.589
Well you had some really good questions. Thank you. Oh you are welcome. Thank you very much for coming

00:04:46.589 --> 00:04:53.790
to visit. We hope you enjoyed learning how Bethel is built but now it's time to go home.
