00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:06.040
Can you imagine a collection of some 40 million books?

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:11.039
They would fill more than 800 miles or 1,300 kilometers of bookshelves.

00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:17.039
And yet that is what you can find and what has been described as the largest library in the world,

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.039
the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. in the United States.

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:28.039
Which book would you say is the most worthwhile to read among all those millions of volumes?

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:31.039
We can let the Apostle Paul answer that question.

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:37.039
In his second letter to Timothy, at second Timothy 315, he referred to the Holy writings

00:00:37.039 --> 00:00:43.039
which are able to make us wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:49.039
He was referring, of course, to God's own written word that we know as the Bible.

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:54.039
The contents of this book can give us the wisdom that we need to gain salvation,

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:59.039
and that makes it the most worthwhile book on earth.

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.039
But how can a book have such a profound effect on a person?

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:09.040
Well, when describing books and their authors per se, the secular writer Gilbert Hyatt once stated,

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:16.040
books are not lumps of lifeless paper, but minds alive on the shelves.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.040
From each of them goes out its own voice.

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.040
So by taking down one of these volumes and opening it,

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:27.040
one can call on to range the voice of a man, the author, far distant in time and space,

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:32.040
and hear him speaking to us, mind to mind, heart to heart.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.040
When we take this book, the Bible down off the shelf and open it,

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.040
we are calling into range the voice of its author, Jehovah.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:48.040
And as he's speaking to us, mind to mind, heart to heart, indeed he is.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:53.040
For example, at Jeremiah 29-11, Jehovah tells us,

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.040
I will know the thoughts that I am thinking toward you,

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:02.040
thoughts of peace and not of calamity to give you a future and a hope.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.040
And at Proverbs 27-11, Jehovah tells us,

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.039
be wise and make my heart rejoice,

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.039
so that I can make a reply to him who taunts me.

00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:17.039
How grateful we are that Jehovah has given us his precious word, the Bible,

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:21.039
that reveals his intimate thoughts and feelings,

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:27.039
that draws us close to him, and that teaches us how to gain everlasting life.

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:32.039
Because we love Jehovah, we also love and cherish what he tells us

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:35.039
through the pages of his written word.

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:40.039
And that is exactly how the Psalmist felt who wrote the 119th Psalm.

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:47.039
Please open your Bible to Psalm 119 and find verse 161.

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:51.039
That's Psalm 119, verse 161.

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:54.039
In the latter part, it says,

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:59.039
but my heart stands in awe of your words.

00:02:59.039 --> 00:03:05.039
Now see what more he wrote in verses 167 and 168.

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:09.039
I keep your reminders and I love them dearly.

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:17.039
I observe your orders and your reminders for you are aware of all that I do.

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:22.039
This Bible writer did not view God's orders and reminders as just a list

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:25.039
of cold legalistic statutes.

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:30.039
And we can be sure that he did not consider them to be burdensome.

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:36.039
Instead, he knew that they formed the basis for the best life possible.

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:40.039
And that is why he not only wanted to learn God's orders,

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:45.039
but he also desired to observe or obey them.

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:50.039
The Psalmists believe that God's word is the one thing we're studying

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:53.039
and that because of knowing God's orders and reminders,

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:59.039
we are far wiser than people who know everything else except God's word.

00:03:59.039 --> 00:04:03.039
Now look at what more he wrote in verse 165.

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:10.039
Abundant peace belongs to those who love your law.

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:13.039
Nothing can make them stumble.

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:18.040
Herein lies a major reason why we love God's word.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.040
A body and by it leads to genuine peace.

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:26.040
Everyone longs for peace in their life and through the pages of the Bible,

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.040
we learn how to attain it.

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.040
That is why we choose to live by God's word,

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.040
even in the face of the trials that arise in our life,

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:40.040
some of which may try to steal away our peace of mind and heart.

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:44.040
And yet, Jehovah knows what we are going through every day of our lives

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:47.040
and stands ready to help us.

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.040
If we love and obey Jehovah's word,

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:55.040
we will not be stumbled spiritually by what someone else does or says

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:59.040
or by any other matter or situation in life.

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:06.040
But how does love for God's word lead to such peace and keep us from stumbling?

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:08.040
We know that all scripture is inspired of God,

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:13.040
making the Bible the most reliable guide for every aspect of life.

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:18.040
After all, His wisdom is infinitely superior to our own.

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:23.040
Reading the Bible enables us to look at matters from God's elevated point of view.

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:30.040
It is just as the prophet Isaiah wrote at Isaiah 55 verses 8 and 9.

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:36.040
If you'd like to open to that, please, Isaiah 55, 8 and 9.

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:38.480
He wrote,

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:41.480
For my thoughts are not your thoughts.

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:45.480
And your ways are not my ways, declares Jehovah.

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:48.480
For as the heavens are higher than the earth,

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:51.480
so my ways are higher than your ways,

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:55.480
and my thoughts than your thoughts.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:06:02.480
Just imagine, Jehovah's thoughts and language must be vastly superior to those of humans.

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:06.480
When he communicates with us as he does through the pages of the Bible,

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:12.480
he simplifies how he expresses his thoughts so that we can understand them.

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:15.480
Then, as we take in all that Jehovah says,

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:19.480
we can let his thinking guide our thinking.

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:23.480
Reading the Bible can be likened to peering into a mirror,

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:29.480
because its message has the power to allow us to see ourselves as we really are,

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:34.480
and it shows us where adjustments are needed in our attitude and conduct.

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:40.110
Thus far in this symposium, we have seen how this can actually work.

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:51.110
We have seen two dramatizations of a widowed mother using the Bible to help her teenage children avoid being stumbled by other young people who had been harassing them.

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:59.110
Remember, her son Gabe had been called a coward by a couple of tough-looking youths while he was engaged in public witnessing.

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:08.110
And her daughter Olivia had been chided by other girls for not being interested in dating one of the guys in her class.

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:13.110
Their mother used what Jehovah inspired the Apostle Paul to write about,

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:21.110
with his ordeal in prison, to show how he was able to preserve his peace in a very difficult situation.

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:27.110
And that in turn helped Olivia and Gabe to safeguard their own peace.

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:37.110
Let's see what more the mother finds in the Bible to help Olivia avoid being stumbled into the conduct that could rob her of peace.

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:39.110
Guess who just walked in.

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:40.110
Olivia.

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:41.110
And there's Jake.

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:42.110
We know she's what.

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:44.110
I don't even know what she's got.

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:45.110
She's into growth.

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:49.110
She's still a virgin.

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:51.110
Olivia, what are you thinking?

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:56.769
I don't know how they can do that.

00:07:57.769 --> 00:07:59.769
I don't even follow them.

00:07:59.769 --> 00:08:06.139
If this doesn't stop, I don't know if I can...

00:08:06.139 --> 00:08:10.920
You're strong.

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:20.379
Okay, you just can't let them get to you.

00:08:20.379 --> 00:08:22.379
It feels out of your control, doesn't it?

00:08:22.379 --> 00:08:38.639
Hey, I think we need another Bible example.

00:08:38.639 --> 00:08:45.779
Remember when we studied about the Shula might girl?

00:08:45.779 --> 00:08:47.779
Yeah, I remember.

00:08:47.779 --> 00:08:54.259
And who was pressuring her?

00:08:54.259 --> 00:08:55.259
Solomon.

00:08:55.259 --> 00:09:04.350
But she wasn't interested in him.

00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:08.350
Just like, I'm not interested in that boy Jake, so.

00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:11.350
But it wasn't just him.

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:14.350
There were the daughters of Jerusalem and Solomon's court.

00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:22.769
They urged her to accept his attentions.

00:09:22.769 --> 00:09:24.769
But do you remember what she said?

00:09:24.769 --> 00:09:27.769
In song of Solomon, chapter 2.

00:09:27.769 --> 00:09:35.129
It says, I put you under oath, O daughters of Jerusalem,

00:09:35.129 --> 00:09:38.129
by the gazelles in the doves of the fields.

00:09:38.129 --> 00:09:43.129
Do not try to awaken or arouse love in me until it feels inclined.

00:09:43.129 --> 00:09:48.700
So despite all of the pressure, who was really in control?

00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:55.179
She was.

00:09:55.179 --> 00:10:02.570
No one was going to push her into something that she didn't want to do.

00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:05.570
She even said, I am a wall.

00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:13.269
You have the same power.

00:10:13.269 --> 00:10:17.269
And if you believe that, it'll change how you handle the pressure.

00:10:17.269 --> 00:10:46.179
No, give me a hug.

00:10:46.179 --> 00:10:47.179
I just posted it.

00:10:47.179 --> 00:10:49.179
I don't like my video.

00:10:49.179 --> 00:10:56.539
All they want is to see me given.

00:10:56.539 --> 00:11:00.539
Why would I give them the satisfaction?

00:11:00.539 --> 00:11:04.539
My piece comes from doing the right thing.

00:11:04.539 --> 00:11:13.490
Nobody can make me stumble.

00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:14.490
And a wall.

00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:31.740
Olivia's mother thought of another inspired Bible example,

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:35.740
that of the Shulamite girl who was being urged by the young women in Solomon's court

00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:38.740
to accept his amorous attentions.

00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:42.740
But despite the pressure, the Shulamite girl remained in control,

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:46.740
for no one was going to push her into something that she did not want to do.

00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:48.740
Olivia got the point.

00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:53.740
As she thought to herself, my piece comes from doing the right thing.

00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:55.740
Nobody can make me stumble.

00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:58.740
I am a wall.

00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:01.740
It's obvious that the mother had a real love for God's word.

00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:05.740
New it well, and calmly and skillfully used it

00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:07.740
to guide the thinking of her children,

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:12.110
to keep them from stumbling.

00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:15.110
So many people these days put God's word out of their mind

00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:18.110
to prevent it from influencing their life.

00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:20.110
But as the world's morals decline,

00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:22.110
we must stick loyally to God's word

00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:26.110
to conform our conduct to His pure and holy thinking

00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:30.110
and strengthen our determination to live by His standards.

00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:35.649
That is just what the Apostle Paul urged us to do

00:12:35.649 --> 00:12:38.649
at Romans 12 and verse 2.

00:12:38.649 --> 00:12:40.649
If you would turn there, please.

00:12:40.649 --> 00:12:43.649
Romans 12 and verse 2.

00:12:43.649 --> 00:12:45.649
Paul wrote,

00:12:45.649 --> 00:12:49.649
and stopped being molded by this system of things,

00:12:49.649 --> 00:12:52.649
but be transformed by making your mind over

00:12:52.649 --> 00:12:56.649
so that you may prove to yourselves the good

00:12:56.649 --> 00:13:00.649
and acceptable and perfect will of God.

00:13:00.649 --> 00:13:03.649
God's word strengthens us to resist conforming

00:13:03.649 --> 00:13:06.649
to the corrupting practices of Satan's world

00:13:06.649 --> 00:13:10.649
and to suppress temptations toward wrongdoing.

00:13:10.649 --> 00:13:14.649
Now as we prove to ourselves that the will of God is good

00:13:14.649 --> 00:13:18.649
and perfect, then we should also accept

00:13:18.649 --> 00:13:21.649
that loyally obeying God is the best way of living.

00:13:21.649 --> 00:13:23.649
There is a direct connection between

00:13:23.649 --> 00:13:26.649
heating scriptural teachings and obeying

00:13:26.649 --> 00:13:29.649
or enjoying genuine peace.

00:13:30.649 --> 00:13:34.649
However, for Jehovah's word to have such power in our lives,

00:13:34.649 --> 00:13:37.649
we need to read the Bible every day

00:13:37.649 --> 00:13:41.649
and meditate on why its counsel is beneficial.

00:13:41.649 --> 00:13:44.649
That means reading it at a pace that allows us

00:13:44.649 --> 00:13:47.649
to ponder on what we are reading.

00:13:47.649 --> 00:13:50.649
And doing this helps to fix in our minds the portions

00:13:50.649 --> 00:13:53.649
that are especially helpful to us.

00:13:53.649 --> 00:13:57.649
When asked why he reads the Bible every day,

00:13:57.649 --> 00:14:00.649
one Christian replied,

00:14:00.649 --> 00:14:02.649
if I repeatedly pray to Jehovah during the day

00:14:02.649 --> 00:14:05.649
and expect him to hear me,

00:14:05.649 --> 00:14:07.649
why shouldn't I also listen to God

00:14:07.649 --> 00:14:10.649
by reading his word every day?

00:14:10.649 --> 00:14:12.649
If we want to be a good friend,

00:14:12.649 --> 00:14:15.649
why would we do all the talking?

00:14:15.649 --> 00:14:18.649
He makes a very good point, doesn't he?

00:14:18.649 --> 00:14:21.649
By reading the Bible, we are listening to Jehovah

00:14:21.649 --> 00:14:25.649
and that is how we get his viewpoint on matters.

00:14:26.649 --> 00:14:31.649
So, do you allow God to speak to you every day?

00:14:32.649 --> 00:14:35.649
We can measure how effective our Bible reading is

00:14:35.649 --> 00:14:38.649
by the influence it has on our attitude and conduct.

00:14:38.649 --> 00:14:40.649
When our peace is disturbed,

00:14:40.649 --> 00:14:45.649
we can look into the source of divine wisdom for God's guidance.

00:14:45.649 --> 00:14:48.649
Speaking prophetically of anointed Christians

00:14:48.649 --> 00:14:51.649
at Isaiah 54-13, the prophet wrote,

00:14:52.649 --> 00:14:55.649
All your sons will be taught by Jehovah

00:14:55.649 --> 00:14:58.649
and their peace will be abundant.

00:14:58.649 --> 00:15:00.649
Now those words apply in principle

00:15:00.649 --> 00:15:03.649
to Christ's other sheep as well.

00:15:03.649 --> 00:15:05.649
Thankfully, when Christ's anointed brothers,

00:15:05.649 --> 00:15:08.649
the faithful and discreet slave prepare spiritual food

00:15:08.649 --> 00:15:10.649
for us, such as this convention program,

00:15:10.649 --> 00:15:12.649
they hold firmly to Jehovah's word

00:15:12.649 --> 00:15:15.649
and they never water it down.

00:15:15.649 --> 00:15:18.649
We always receive spiritual instruction

00:15:18.649 --> 00:15:22.649
that upholds Jehovah's high moral standards.

00:15:22.649 --> 00:15:25.649
And we are blessed with abundant peace

00:15:25.649 --> 00:15:29.929
when we accept Jehovah's instruction.

00:15:29.929 --> 00:15:31.929
Isaiah penned another prophecy

00:15:31.929 --> 00:15:33.929
that is being fulfilled today

00:15:33.929 --> 00:15:36.929
and that we find at Isaiah 2 verses 2 through 4.

00:15:36.929 --> 00:15:38.929
He saw in a vision of the last days

00:15:38.929 --> 00:15:41.929
people from all the nations streaming to true worship

00:15:41.929 --> 00:15:43.929
and for what reason?

00:15:43.929 --> 00:15:45.929
Isaiah wrote of Jehovah,

00:15:45.929 --> 00:15:48.929
He will instruct us about his ways

00:15:48.929 --> 00:15:51.929
and we will walk in his paths

00:15:51.929 --> 00:15:53.929
and in what would this result?

00:15:53.929 --> 00:15:56.929
So that they will beat their swords into plowshares

00:15:56.929 --> 00:15:59.929
and their spears into pruning shears.

00:15:59.929 --> 00:16:02.929
Nation will not lift up sword against nation

00:16:02.929 --> 00:16:06.929
nor will they learn war anymore.

00:16:06.929 --> 00:16:09.929
In his goodness, Jehovah is willing to teach

00:16:09.929 --> 00:16:12.929
we imperfect humans how to achieve genuine,

00:16:12.929 --> 00:16:15.929
abundant peace, earthwide.

00:16:15.929 --> 00:16:17.929
And he does that through the pages

00:16:17.929 --> 00:16:19.929
of his own written word.

00:16:19.929 --> 00:16:23.929
What a privilege it is to be taught by our God.

00:16:23.929 --> 00:16:27.929
No matter what problem may threaten the peace of our personal life,

00:16:27.929 --> 00:16:30.929
our family, or our congregation,

00:16:30.929 --> 00:16:33.929
we are confident that the solution

00:16:33.929 --> 00:16:35.929
can be found in the Bible.

00:16:35.929 --> 00:16:38.929
And as we have learned from this symposium,

00:16:38.929 --> 00:16:40.929
our continued love for Jehovah,

00:16:40.929 --> 00:16:43.929
for our neighbor, and for God's word,

00:16:43.929 --> 00:16:46.929
lead to our enjoying everlasting peace

00:16:46.929 --> 00:16:48.929
in God's new world.
