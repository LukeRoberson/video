00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:09.980
What though if someone suffers from a condition that makes it difficult to focus on Bible truth at meetings family worship our personal study

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:15.699
In some cases we patiently wait for Jehovah's Cure in the new system

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.300
But for others like 10-year-old Jaden Schreiber

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:23.699
Adjustments are possible that can help them to benefit from Bible study

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:38.579
Jaden Saturday morning time to get a preservice

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:45.579
When I wake up to a ministry day, I enjoy waking up to that day

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:51.899
Because I look forward to it, I have fun doing the ministry with the friends

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:57.899
I love showing the Caleb videos to the little kids at the door

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:00.899
But it hasn't always been so easy

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:03.899
I have autism

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.900
Loud noises were really really hard for me

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.900
Like when the audience laughed or clapped

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.900
Or even crowds, like a lot of people, you just can't be around them

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.900
Because you just feel like this is too much

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.900
Family worship was difficult when I was eight or nine

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.900
And I just didn't really want to do it, it was getting all my nerves, it was just not really easy

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.900
Some days it felt impossible to go to school

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:43.530
There was a day when I went outside and I just like, I cannot go back in there

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.530
One time, a kid came out of nowhere and just pushed me over

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.530
Me and me feel physical pain and emotional pain

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:00.530
When other kids were playing without me, it just made me feel a little upset that they're leaving me out

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.530
Just made me feel a bit lonely

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.530
At first, my parents did not know how to communicate with me

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.530
I had mental and social challenges

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.530
The brothers and sisters could not understand what I was doing

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.530
My parents found out I had autism

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.530
Then as the years passed, it got easier and easier for them to communicate with me

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:37.530
The friends in the congregation have helped me by doing whatever they need to do to help me stay on the road to life

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:44.530
Some of the ways that my parents have helped me to learn about Jehovah are household activities

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.530
Like making food, going out in nature and failing worship

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:57.530
My parents took a new route by situating spiritual things all day long instead of one thing once or twice a week

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.780
And now, family worship cannot be better

00:03:08.419 --> 00:03:12.419
Relation with Jehovah has helped me overcome challenges

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:16.419
He is also a better friend to me than ever before

00:03:17.419 --> 00:03:24.419
By family worship, Bible reading, personal Bible reading, and I do like the whiteboard animations

00:03:25.419 --> 00:03:30.419
Meeting a bully without using your fist, it's helped me to show how to deal with it

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:32.419
Actually, I was right then

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:37.419
I was starting to experience some bad things going on in my school

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:41.419
And when they started doing those whiteboard animations, it pretty much saved me

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:47.419
We just love him so much, he's just been such a bright spot

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:50.419
He loves giving pictures to people

00:03:50.419 --> 00:03:51.419
They're a little piece of him

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:54.419
Whether it's a picture of a really cool car or whatever he's drawn

00:03:54.419 --> 00:03:57.419
He's handing you a piece of himself

00:03:57.419 --> 00:03:59.419
Well, I can remember when I was his age

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:02.419
I would never be up in front of that many people

00:04:02.419 --> 00:04:04.419
Jaden has dealt with that fear

00:04:05.419 --> 00:04:07.419
And he seems very comfortable with it now

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:10.419
He's not afraid to speak in front of the congregation

00:04:11.419 --> 00:04:13.419
And the congregation is very supportive

00:04:14.419 --> 00:04:17.420
I feel like I've been an important part of the congregation by publishing

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:20.420
When I took a personal interest of those time meeting the ministry

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:22.420
I started getting a return visit

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:24.420
And I started showing videos

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:29.420
In fact, we are studying the good news from God Rocher

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:33.420
Really, anytime Jaden answers, the congregation really pays attention

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:35.420
He speaks from his heart when he answers

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:37.420
And the brothers and sisters really appreciate that

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:40.420
It was really fun to take a trip to New York

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:42.420
Bethel was very fun

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:45.420
I got to meet some of the brothers and sisters

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:48.420
I also felt like it was part of something

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:52.420
When I was at Bethel, they helped me make a box

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:55.420
I don't know where that box went

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:58.420
But I knew I was helping somebody to come into the truth

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:00.420
And become closer to Jehovah

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:05.420
We've really seen how Jehovah has greatly blessed Jaden

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:11.420
Because he has his own ministry, he's able to practice his social skills

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:15.420
Both at the door and with the brothers and sisters that are out in service

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:22.420
And we really feel that Jehovah has created the perfect environment for Jaden to thrive spiritually

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:27.420
I can't believe that this is actually happening

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:31.420
That I'm actually born into Jehovah's organization

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:33.420
Thank you Jehovah

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:41.129
Jaden has a form of autism spectrum disorder

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:45.129
That still allows him to participate in spiritual activity

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:50.129
The loving help he receives from his family and congregation

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:53.129
Are a beautiful part of their fine works

00:05:53.129 --> 00:05:58.129
It's our prayer that the variety of spiritual food now available

00:05:58.129 --> 00:06:02.129
Will help others with challenging conditions to benefit from God's Word
