00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:06.490
I was trying to get caught up on paperwork for the circuit overseas visit.

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:08.490
There was so much to do.

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:16.309
You gotta be kidding me.

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:25.510
Well, you're home early, honey.

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:27.510
I said something was wrong.

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.510
The kids had left a few things out and I was a bit preoccupied.

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:35.619
The tough day?

00:00:35.619 --> 00:00:38.619
You were supposed to talk to the girls about this.

00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:40.619
They're making it a habit.

00:00:40.619 --> 00:00:51.939
The more I thought about it though,

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:54.939
I realized it wasn't just a kitchen.

00:00:54.939 --> 00:01:00.140
I guess I was part of the problem.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.140
Or maybe the problem was me.

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:10.290
You see, my wife is an amazing woman.

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:18.519
I'm so loving.

00:01:18.519 --> 00:01:30.549
It would be an understatement to call her industrious.

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:42.099
And then there's her infectious joy.

00:01:42.099 --> 00:01:46.379
I mean, how could I not love her?

00:01:46.379 --> 00:01:52.719
But sometimes it takes more than saying I love you.

00:01:55.099 --> 00:01:58.099
You know, honey, you're right.

00:01:58.099 --> 00:02:01.099
This is completely unacceptable.

00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:04.099
I'll talk to the girls as soon as they come through that door.

00:02:04.099 --> 00:02:05.099
Thank you.

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:06.099
I love you.

00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:08.099
I love you too.

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:19.379
I was so tired after work,

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:22.379
but glad to finally get home.

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:35.590
Until you gotta be kidding me.

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:36.590
You're home, honey.

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.969
I knew he had congregation staff to work on.

00:02:40.969 --> 00:02:42.969
But seriously?

00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:45.969
The tough day?

00:02:45.969 --> 00:02:47.969
You were supposed to talk to the girls about this.

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:49.969
They're making it a habit.

00:02:49.969 --> 00:02:59.449
At first, it upset me he didn't say anything.

00:02:59.449 --> 00:03:03.449
But then, I began to think.

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:07.449
It's actually something I've come to love about John.

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:09.449
His patience.

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:16.340
He doesn't overreact.

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:25.300
He's thoughtful, concerned.

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:31.099
He really listens.

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:44.949
It's why he's such a good elder.

00:03:44.949 --> 00:04:01.300
And why we've enjoyed so many blessings together.

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:05.669
Sometimes, I forget.

00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:11.969
And I could be more patient.

00:04:11.969 --> 00:04:14.969
You know, honey, you're right.

00:04:14.969 --> 00:04:17.970
This is completely unacceptable.

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.970
I'll talk to the girls as soon as they come through that door.

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:21.970
Thank you.

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:22.970
I love you.

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:23.970
I love you too.

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:30.420
Thank you.

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:31.420
I love you.

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:35.040
I love you too.

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.040
Show time.

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.040
So the fire drill went off right when we were having a match.

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.040
Tested.

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.040
Him, I'm death.

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:47.379
Got a shower before us then.

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:48.379
Girls?

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:49.379
Okay.

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:50.379
You need to finish the kitchen now.

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:51.379
No, we don't have any time.

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:52.379
We just got home.

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:53.379
Yeah, we've been through for 15 minutes.

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:54.379
No discussion.

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:55.379
No excuses.

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:57.379
Now.

00:04:57.379 --> 00:04:58.379
Okay.

00:04:58.379 --> 00:05:07.610
Thanks.

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.610
I did tell them to leave the kitchen spot with, didn't I?

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:14.430
Yeah.

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:16.430
They needed to hear that.

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.430
True.

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:23.430
It's just overall, they are.

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:25.430
I know.

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:27.430
I know.

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:34.730
They were actually pioneering during the circuit over series visit.

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:44.060
They really put themselves out for others.

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:45.060
Including you.

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.660
I mean us.

00:05:48.660 --> 00:06:17.259
We ever want to take them for granted.

00:06:17.259 --> 00:06:19.259
Girls?

00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:21.259
I felt the big mess earlier.

00:06:21.259 --> 00:06:23.259
Thanks for cleaning that up.

00:06:23.259 --> 00:06:26.259
Your mom and I, we were upset.

00:06:26.259 --> 00:06:30.259
But we really want you to know that...

00:06:30.259 --> 00:06:33.579
You are gifts from Jehovah.

00:06:33.579 --> 00:06:35.579
Precious gifts.

00:06:35.579 --> 00:06:36.579
We both cherish.

00:06:36.579 --> 00:06:38.579
We love you very much.

00:06:38.579 --> 00:06:40.579
What your mom said.

00:06:40.579 --> 00:06:56.379
Man, I'm so happy today because that fighter interrupted our mattress.

00:06:56.379 --> 00:06:58.379
But we have to do it tomorrow.

00:06:58.379 --> 00:07:00.379
We're gonna be studying in all night.

00:07:00.379 --> 00:07:02.379
Hey mom, dad, got a shower before our study.

00:07:02.379 --> 00:07:05.240
No discussion.

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.240
No excuses.

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:09.240
Now.

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:14.019
Okay.

00:07:14.019 --> 00:07:16.019
Where did all of this come from?

00:07:16.019 --> 00:07:18.019
We're gonna be here all night.

00:07:18.019 --> 00:07:37.560
It did give us time to think.

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:49.029
They are such good examples.

00:07:49.029 --> 00:07:53.079
Mom never stops working.

00:07:53.079 --> 00:08:00.740
And our home is always, always beautiful.

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:07.160
They give us so much of their time.

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:10.470
And themselves.

00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:12.470
A bit cheesy sometimes.

00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:15.470
But overall, they're pretty great.

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:20.420
That night, they didn't lecture us.

00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:23.420
They just reminded us of one thing.

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:26.420
And it was pretty deep.

00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:29.420
When we dedicate our lives to Jehovah,

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:32.419
our lives includes everything.

00:08:32.419 --> 00:08:37.419
Our time, our resources, our home.

00:08:37.419 --> 00:08:38.419
Our kitchen.

00:08:38.419 --> 00:08:40.419
Yes, our kitchen.

00:08:40.419 --> 00:08:43.419
And how we care for those things,

00:08:43.419 --> 00:08:45.419
it reflects on him.

00:08:45.419 --> 00:08:48.419
And on us as your parents.

00:08:48.419 --> 00:08:50.419
That kind of sank in.

00:08:50.419 --> 00:08:53.419
I knew I could do better.

00:08:53.419 --> 00:08:56.419
No mom, we got this.

00:08:56.419 --> 00:08:59.419
Um, we got this?

00:08:59.419 --> 00:09:02.419
Oh yeah, we got this.
