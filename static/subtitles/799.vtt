WEBVTT

00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:02.879
We now have a special treat

00:00:03.759 --> 00:00:09.519
Brother Stephen led of the governing body will give a talk based on a specific Bible verse

00:00:10.119 --> 00:00:11.960
His talk is

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.199
sing out joyfully to Jehovah

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:19.719
Mark my words. This is a special treat

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:31.859
I hope I can live up to his comments

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.899
David dead it as he played on his harp

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:44.380
The Levites did it regularly at the temple

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.700
Jesus did it shortly before being executed

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:54.700
Paul and Silas did it while in stocks deep in a prison dungeon

00:00:55.659 --> 00:01:01.659
The resurrected anointed do it as they stand before Jehovah's throne

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.780
What activity are we talking about?

00:01:05.739 --> 00:01:15.260
We're talking about singing songs of praise to Jehovah and of course all of us want to imitate these fine Bible examples

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:22.540
But now how do we want to sing these songs? What approach? Well, let's go to first Chronicles chapter 15

00:01:23.019 --> 00:01:28.620
And let's see how we want to sing these songs of praise

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.780
First Chronicles 15 verse 16

00:01:33.739 --> 00:01:36.620
David then told the chiefs of the Levites

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:43.739
To appoint their brothers the singers now notice to sing out joyfully

00:01:45.019 --> 00:01:49.659
A accompanied by musical instruments stringed instruments

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.140
harps and symbols

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.379
Now this scripture say that we should move our lips

00:01:57.579 --> 00:01:59.579
But with no sound coming out of her mouth

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.099
Can you imagine Jesus singing like that?

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.939
Does this scripture indicate we should mumble our words

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:10.939
Speaking an undertone like we do sometimes when we read the Bible

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.740
No, we're told us sing out

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.780
That means obviously enthusiastically projecting our voices

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.819
Perhaps you remember a picture in the inside cover pages

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.780
Of one of our previous songbooks

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:29.180
It was a picture of the Levites singing

00:02:30.139 --> 00:02:33.340
And obviously they were projecting their voices

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.620
In fact their mouths were so wide open you can almost see their tonsils

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.780
Well, good example for us

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.180
Think about this

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.300
Many worldly people will sing out worldly songs with a joyful attitude

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.180
Well much more so

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.180
Our God who is worthy of such worshipful praise

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.780
Do we want to give it to him enthusiastically?

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.740
But now let's look at a brief video

00:03:02.219 --> 00:03:04.219
That highlights some of the history

00:03:04.219 --> 00:03:10.539
About how Jehovah's people have always felt about singing songs of praise to Jehovah

00:03:12.219 --> 00:03:14.460
I love singing to Jehovah

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:19.099
It's something that I find so personally strengthening

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:24.219
I think it's such a wonderful privilege to be able to praise Jehovah's name by singing

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.300
Mind you I would never be called a professional singer

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.060
We know that birds sing but they're not singing praises to Jehovah

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.340
And of course dogs bark and cats me out

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.180
But humans can really sing and praise you over with their words

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.419
And it always reminds me of the account in the book of Acts

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:49.740
Acts chapter 16 where it talks about the apostle Paul and Silas when they were in prison

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:52.620
This is but about the middle of the night

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.699
Paul and Silas were praying and praising God with song

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.180
And the prisoners were listening to them

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.340
Obviously

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:06.939
The songs that they sang at that time helped them to ease the pain of their very sore backs

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:08.539
They had been beaten

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:12.860
So the spiritual side of us become stronger when we sing

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:17.930
In our organization from the very beginning

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:19.129
uh

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:20.490
Hems were used

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:26.569
But then the brothers and sisters began producing their own songs and they put them into book form

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.610
Back in 1944

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.689
We released a song book that was called the Kingdom Service Songbook

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.370
And after a half a million copies have been released

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:39.610
At just six years later

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:43.129
1950 we come out with a brand new songbook

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:44.970
Songs to Jehovah's praise

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.009
Now no doubt many of the brothers wondered why are we doing this

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:52.889
But of course you see the new world translation of the Christian Greek scriptures

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:55.129
Had just been released in 1950

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:58.730
And then we've had several books that have been released down through the the decades

00:04:59.689 --> 00:05:03.050
So it's always been a part of the modern-day worship

00:05:15.399 --> 00:05:18.839
You know when you ponder what we've discussed thus far

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:22.680
You're probably beginning to ask yourself

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.959
When are we going to get our new songbook

00:05:29.259 --> 00:05:35.500
Well, I must tell you that the song book project has proved to be more challenging

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:39.339
Or complex than the governing body anticipated

00:05:39.579 --> 00:05:43.740
But nevertheless despite the challenges the complications

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:51.259
We're confident that we're going to be able to release this book to you within less than 12 months

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:07.819
In fact, we're talking about much less than 12 months

00:06:08.779 --> 00:06:13.660
We're talking about right now the governing body is very happy to release

00:06:25.699 --> 00:06:27.699
I don't think I had most of you fooled

00:06:29.779 --> 00:06:37.139
We are so happy to release this new songbook entitled sing out joyfully to Jehovah

00:06:37.379 --> 00:06:40.019
That's the SO JJ book

00:06:41.459 --> 00:06:43.459
Brotherhood

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:58.600
This new songbook sing out joyfully to Jehovah

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:02.120
Is being provided in three formats

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:04.759
There's the small

00:07:04.759 --> 00:07:07.319
The large with musical notations

00:07:07.959 --> 00:07:12.199
And then there's in the large size only lyrics only

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:16.439
And you're going to be able to obtain your personal copy

00:07:17.079 --> 00:07:18.920
electronically

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:22.279
In English this will be Monday October the 3rd

00:07:22.759 --> 00:07:27.000
So we're talking about just two days from now you can go on to jw.org

00:07:27.959 --> 00:07:29.959
Watchtower online library

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:36.439
jw library and you can get that copy of this beautiful song book

00:07:36.759 --> 00:07:38.439
But now here's a question

00:07:38.439 --> 00:07:43.399
How soon are we going to sing songs from the new song book

00:07:44.199 --> 00:07:48.199
Well you'll be happy to know that beginning January just three much from now

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:53.160
English-speaking congregations will begin to sing these new songs

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:55.480
And you'll be happy to know too

00:07:55.560 --> 00:08:01.160
That the governing body has arranged for a new provision to come along with a new songbook

00:08:01.879 --> 00:08:06.519
We're going to have the lyrics in video format

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:15.399
Now we enjoyed right here having the lyrics on the screen and we enjoyed during the summer conventions

00:08:15.399 --> 00:08:17.560
The regional and the special conventions

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:23.800
Instead of having to look down and try to look at your songbook and your tablet

00:08:24.519 --> 00:08:26.759
We were able to hold our heads erect

00:08:28.199 --> 00:08:30.759
And sing out joyfully to Jehovah

00:08:31.639 --> 00:08:33.639
Well, you'll be able to do that in the congregation

00:08:47.049 --> 00:08:50.570
But now we talked about receiving our songbook electronically

00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:58.809
And we noticed that many of you are using electronic devices in order to receive the publications and to use them

00:08:59.289 --> 00:09:01.289
And this is commendable

00:09:01.289 --> 00:09:04.009
This saves the organization considerable fines

00:09:04.649 --> 00:09:08.169
But what if you want hard copy of the new songbook

00:09:08.889 --> 00:09:13.610
Well, we're happy to inform you that you can order through the congregation

00:09:14.409 --> 00:09:15.850
hard copy

00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:21.850
Within a few days English-speaking congregations and also several other language-speaking congregations

00:09:22.409 --> 00:09:27.370
Will receive a letter telling you how you may submit the order

00:09:28.090 --> 00:09:32.250
And we're happy to inform you too that the hard copy

00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:36.490
This songbook will have, whether it's the small or the large

00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:44.330
It'll have the same beautiful gray deluxe cover that our revised New World Translation Bible has

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:46.330
So what a beautiful complement

00:09:46.649 --> 00:09:50.889
The songbook will be to the Bible for those that use hard copy

00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:56.889
You will truly enjoy using the beautiful gray twins

00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:12.169
But now we talked about English mostly

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:13.769
What about other languages?

00:10:14.409 --> 00:10:18.649
Well, translations are being made into other languages as we speak

00:10:19.210 --> 00:10:23.289
And as soon as possible these other language releases will be made

00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:25.370
In fact, I've been informed

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:34.730
That there'll be quite a number of other languages will be able to release the songbook in that language within less than 12 months

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:38.330
And this time I'm not teasing

00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:44.330
But additional information will be provided as soon as available

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:49.049
But now let's discuss some interesting information about the new songbook

00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:52.330
First we're going to talk about the composition of the songs

00:10:53.049 --> 00:10:56.250
And then a little bit about the structure of the songbook

00:10:56.730 --> 00:10:58.250
But now you're probably thinking

00:10:59.129 --> 00:11:02.490
Why is brother's plane not presenting this information

00:11:04.409 --> 00:11:07.049
Why is brother let trying to present this

00:11:07.929 --> 00:11:09.529
Well, I can understand your question

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:15.000
I had the same question

00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:22.740
But the truth is all seven members of the governing body

00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:27.379
Love very much singing songs of praise to Jehovah

00:11:27.539 --> 00:11:30.259
Of course some are a lot better singers than the rest of us

00:11:31.299 --> 00:11:37.139
And all of us are happy that we don't have student singing assignments on the midweek meeting

00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:43.139
Because we wouldn't want to send the brothers running for their earplugs

00:11:44.419 --> 00:11:46.740
But now I've got to get serious

00:11:48.419 --> 00:11:51.860
Let's talk about the composition of the songs

00:11:52.659 --> 00:11:57.940
Well, here's an interesting point rather than request contributed songs from various songwriters

00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:01.299
The governing body assigned a composer

00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:06.179
And a lyricist's team to work specifically on the project

00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:10.019
And then the governing body closely supervised that team

00:12:10.899 --> 00:12:13.620
For example providing subject themes

00:12:14.179 --> 00:12:21.539
For songs that would be very relevant to our meetings assemblies conventions and the field ministry

00:12:22.179 --> 00:12:26.340
And the team worked very hard specifically crafting each song

00:12:27.059 --> 00:12:29.059
According to that direction

00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:31.700
Here's another point as you can imagine

00:12:32.019 --> 00:12:36.980
The revised new world translation resulted in changing a lot of the lyrics

00:12:37.779 --> 00:12:40.820
A replacement of different words and expressions

00:12:40.899 --> 00:12:45.620
Just a few examples most references to she all seed long suffering

00:12:46.259 --> 00:12:47.860
Have been replaced

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:52.580
The song long suffering is now exercise patience

00:12:53.539 --> 00:12:56.659
The expression loving kindness is now loyal love

00:12:57.620 --> 00:13:04.100
Time and definite has been replaced with expressions such as forevermore or eternal life

00:13:05.059 --> 00:13:06.259
Here's another point

00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:09.779
Doctrinal refinements of course affect this some of the lyrics

00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:12.740
Just one example

00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:16.980
The expanded explanation of the meaning of Jehovah's name

00:13:17.779 --> 00:13:21.220
resulted in opening the door to more application

00:13:22.019 --> 00:13:24.980
To Jehovah causing to become

00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:27.700
Here's another point

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:32.980
An effort was made to have less direct counsel in the songs

00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:37.299
So rather than some feeling awkward as they were singing

00:13:37.299 --> 00:13:42.019
Prezes that they were maybe giving counsel to others as they were singing

00:13:42.019 --> 00:13:44.019
Well, we've changed that

00:13:44.019 --> 00:13:46.179
That has been taken out

00:13:46.179 --> 00:13:49.220
Here's another thing there certain awkward expressions

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:53.779
Have been removed from the songs just one example

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:56.500
One of our current songs

00:13:56.899 --> 00:14:02.100
There was an expression that made it appear that single people are probably lonely

00:14:03.059 --> 00:14:05.139
Well, we took that out

00:14:08.299 --> 00:14:09.340
Here's another detail

00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:13.340
And we present this in a form of a caution

00:14:14.059 --> 00:14:17.500
Be careful when you're singing from the new song book

00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:21.659
Because the majority of the songs these older songs

00:14:22.139 --> 00:14:24.779
Have had lyrics adjusted

00:14:24.779 --> 00:14:27.580
So if you just sing from your previous memory bank

00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:30.620
You're going to find yourself off and in trouble

00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:36.220
But now just a few comments about the structure of the song book

00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:40.059
An effort has been made to put the songs in subject order

00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:43.179
And there are 15 categories now

00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:48.059
And the categories are listed in the index in the front of the song book

00:14:48.059 --> 00:14:50.059
The first 12 songs

00:14:50.059 --> 00:14:54.299
appropriately are under the category Jehovah

00:14:55.019 --> 00:14:58.460
And these are songs of direct praise to Jehovah

00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:01.659
Our songs about his name are his qualities

00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:04.139
Meeting together

00:15:04.139 --> 00:15:05.899
That's another category

00:15:05.899 --> 00:15:09.980
Songs about our meeting together and worshiping together

00:15:10.779 --> 00:15:12.539
category godly qualities

00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:16.860
And included among other songs in this section

00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:24.139
Our songs that develop each one of the aspects of the footage of the Holy Spirit

00:15:24.139 --> 00:15:27.019
Mentioning Galatians 5, 22 and 23

00:15:27.019 --> 00:15:30.379
And they're developed in the order in the song book

00:15:30.379 --> 00:15:32.700
That they're listed in that scripture

00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:34.539
So that's very helpful

00:15:34.539 --> 00:15:37.419
But now here's something we'd like to say regarding the structure

00:15:38.059 --> 00:15:42.379
There is no significance to the song numbers

00:15:43.019 --> 00:15:45.019
Assigned to each song

00:15:45.659 --> 00:15:48.539
Over the years some have worked very hard

00:15:48.539 --> 00:15:51.820
Try to figure out the significance of the song numbers

00:15:52.779 --> 00:15:54.539
For example

00:15:54.539 --> 00:15:56.539
Many concluded

00:15:56.539 --> 00:15:58.539
It wasn't just coincidence

00:15:58.539 --> 00:16:02.539
That the song be forgiving was song number 77

00:16:06.009 --> 00:16:08.009
Similarly

00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:11.129
The song where Jehovah's Witnesses

00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:16.009
Many thought it was no coincidence that that song was song number 1931

00:16:16.009 --> 00:16:17.529
I mean 31

00:16:20.009 --> 00:16:21.450
But we want to tell you up front

00:16:22.409 --> 00:16:26.009
There is no significance to the numbering

00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:29.049
And for that matter

00:16:29.049 --> 00:16:31.370
There was not in the current song book

00:16:33.850 --> 00:16:35.929
The numbers are random

00:16:36.250 --> 00:16:39.769
With the songs placed in the category they fit best

00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:45.289
And where they fit best in regard to the engraving layout

00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:48.009
Now here is another thought

00:16:48.009 --> 00:16:51.610
Three of the older songs have been removed

00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:53.370
From the new song book

00:16:54.090 --> 00:16:58.169
And quite a number have been totally revised with new subjects

00:16:58.169 --> 00:16:59.210
For example

00:16:59.210 --> 00:17:01.370
The song the scene of this world is changing

00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:04.089
Has now been totally revised

00:17:04.089 --> 00:17:06.890
To a more positive subject

00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:09.450
Keep working, watching and waiting

00:17:10.569 --> 00:17:12.569
The song making our way successful

00:17:13.289 --> 00:17:16.650
Is now life depends on God's word

00:17:16.650 --> 00:17:20.089
The song formerly content with God's good gifts

00:17:20.170 --> 00:17:21.690
Which had limited use

00:17:21.690 --> 00:17:24.089
Is now teaching the word of God

00:17:24.089 --> 00:17:28.009
A much more practical subject for our meetings or our field

00:17:28.009 --> 00:17:29.210
Ministry

00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:32.730
Now here's one more point regarding the structure

00:17:32.730 --> 00:17:35.210
Many of the songs have been reformatted

00:17:36.410 --> 00:17:38.970
And spread out over more pages

00:17:38.970 --> 00:17:39.289
Why?

00:17:40.009 --> 00:17:41.049
Well for one thing

00:17:41.049 --> 00:17:43.450
It gives more space for other languages

00:17:44.250 --> 00:17:46.170
That need more space

00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:47.930
To be able to put the lyrics

00:17:48.009 --> 00:17:49.529
Under the musical notes

00:17:50.170 --> 00:17:52.009
Another advantage by spreading them out

00:17:52.569 --> 00:17:54.890
It makes it easier to read the music

00:17:54.890 --> 00:17:57.690
In the case of those who enjoy playing

00:17:57.930 --> 00:18:00.089
The songs on piano

00:18:00.809 --> 00:18:02.809
But now let's look at another video

00:18:03.609 --> 00:18:05.210
And this one

00:18:05.210 --> 00:18:07.609
Shows us some interesting facts

00:18:07.609 --> 00:18:10.730
About the making of our new song book

00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:17.160
The governing bodies support for this project was unanimous

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:20.839
One of the reasons we felt it was especially important

00:18:20.839 --> 00:18:23.559
Was because of the revised new world translation

00:18:23.559 --> 00:18:26.920
It was important for us to change the songs as well

00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:31.480
So that all the terminology in the revised version would match the songs

00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:35.720
In our audience we have some of our brothers and sisters who have the heavenly hope

00:18:36.359 --> 00:18:38.920
And of course the majority in our audience

00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:42.599
Are looking forward to life everlasting right here on the earth

00:18:42.599 --> 00:18:46.680
So the words of our song would have to include both groups

00:18:47.319 --> 00:18:51.559
There are a few songs that were very really used in meetings and assemblies

00:18:51.559 --> 00:18:53.079
Because of the subject

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:57.000
They may have been relevant subjects years back but not anymore

00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:01.160
So those songs the same melody is being used

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:03.400
But you'll find there's a brand new theme

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:07.000
In our song book in recent years there has definitely been an effort

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.319
To have more diversity of style

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:11.559
It really helps all of us

00:19:11.559 --> 00:19:14.599
No matter what our background from what part of the world we come from

00:19:14.599 --> 00:19:16.200
To be unified in our worship

00:19:17.559 --> 00:19:20.440
When we get the music from the arranger

00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:24.519
We have to format it so it fits properly to the page

00:19:24.519 --> 00:19:26.279
As it will appear in the song book

00:19:26.839 --> 00:19:31.160
We supply the branches with music only notation

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:35.480
And this way they can pour in the translated lyrics

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:40.200
Its songs really are probably the most difficult translation project that you can handle

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:43.799
Take an English verse like listen or bay and be blessed

00:19:44.359 --> 00:19:47.400
It's not difficult to express that idea in another language

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:50.759
But the music there has only seven notes

00:19:53.559 --> 00:19:58.200
So the challenge is to express those ideas and make them fit into those

00:19:58.200 --> 00:19:59.960
Said with those seven notes

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:02.920
So for all of these reasons this is the work for a lyricist

00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:05.559
Someone who can rewrite the song

00:20:05.559 --> 00:20:08.359
And the make sure that it conveys the right ideas

00:20:08.359 --> 00:20:09.559
The right mood

00:20:09.559 --> 00:20:11.480
But at the same time that it is poetic

00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:14.200
That it touches the heart of those who are going to sing it

00:20:24.809 --> 00:20:26.730
What a wonderful thing to think

00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:30.089
That worldwide in hundreds of languages

00:20:30.089 --> 00:20:33.769
Our brothers and sisters are having the same very experience

00:20:33.769 --> 00:20:37.609
Being able to use their words to praise Jehovah in song

00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:42.089
The government body feels very strongly about singing

00:20:42.089 --> 00:20:45.529
So that's why they actually created a cover

00:20:45.529 --> 00:20:47.289
That looks just like any world translation

00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:52.089
The songbook has been organized into subject order

00:20:52.089 --> 00:20:53.609
There are more songs in the book

00:20:53.609 --> 00:20:55.609
There's 151 songs

00:20:55.609 --> 00:20:58.009
But also the songs have been spread out a little bit more

00:20:58.009 --> 00:21:00.809
That's mainly for translation

00:21:00.809 --> 00:21:04.490
The websites will have easier navigation tools

00:21:04.490 --> 00:21:07.769
To help us to find the song number we're looking for

00:21:07.769 --> 00:21:10.250
So we can listen to the song or the vocal rendition

00:21:10.250 --> 00:21:15.289
While the phrase that is to be sung during that portion of the song

00:21:15.289 --> 00:21:18.490
We'll highlight as the song plays through

00:21:18.490 --> 00:21:22.730
We need to take the time right now to learn these new songs

00:21:22.730 --> 00:21:24.410
And then to sing them

00:21:24.410 --> 00:21:25.690
You know, sing them all the time

00:21:25.690 --> 00:21:28.009
Sing them when we're working around the house

00:21:28.009 --> 00:21:29.849
Sing them when we're in the car

00:21:29.849 --> 00:21:33.849
Sing them when we come together for social gatherings with our brothers

00:21:33.849 --> 00:21:36.569
They have the power to strengthen us

00:21:37.690 --> 00:21:40.650
It's showing respect for Jehovah when we actually stand there

00:21:40.650 --> 00:21:42.089
With the congregation

00:21:42.089 --> 00:21:43.849
Sing with the congregation

00:21:43.849 --> 00:21:46.650
It brings the congregation together and worship

00:21:46.650 --> 00:21:49.450
So when we combine how we feel

00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:51.450
When we sing from our hearts

00:21:51.450 --> 00:21:55.450
We can be sure that Jehovah will accept that as appreciation

00:21:55.450 --> 00:21:59.130
Well, I think this scripture in Psalm 104

00:21:59.130 --> 00:22:03.690
In verse 33 really reflects the feelings of all of Jehovah's people

00:22:03.690 --> 00:22:05.130
When it says

00:22:05.130 --> 00:22:08.650
I will sing to Jehovah throughout my life

00:22:08.650 --> 00:22:13.130
I will sing praises to my God as long as I live

00:22:13.130 --> 00:22:15.529
That's the desire that we all have

00:22:15.529 --> 00:22:28.539
To be able to sing praises to Jehovah forever

00:22:28.539 --> 00:22:32.140
Obviously, our new songbook

00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:35.819
Is a gift from the giver of every good gift

00:22:35.819 --> 00:22:37.579
Every perfect present

00:22:37.579 --> 00:22:42.779
You brothers and sisters are going to love singing from the new songbook

00:22:42.779 --> 00:22:44.619
So by all means

00:22:44.619 --> 00:22:46.299
Use it to the full

00:22:46.299 --> 00:23:08.950
Use it completely to sing out joyfully to Jehovah

00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:12.789
We told you it would be a special treat

00:23:12.789 --> 00:23:17.269
Not only was brother, let's delivery special but we have

00:23:17.269 --> 00:23:20.630
The special treat of a new songbook now

00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:26.470
And we add it to the long line of songbooks

00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:28.069
That have come before

00:23:28.069 --> 00:23:33.190
Some of you can reach back many years with various different songbooks

00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:41.670
The songbook is to describe it praise worthy

00:23:41.670 --> 00:23:44.920
You see that in your notes?

00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:48.759
What does that mean? Highly commendable

00:23:48.759 --> 00:23:51.319
That's our songbook

00:23:51.319 --> 00:23:58.420
Now if that was special this next part is truly unique

00:23:58.420 --> 00:24:02.579
I do not remember ever hearing an interview

00:24:02.579 --> 00:24:07.299
From this unique group of interviewees

00:24:07.299 --> 00:24:11.539
Brother Ralph Walls, a helper for the personnel committee of the governing body

00:24:11.539 --> 00:24:16.180
Will take the lead in the video interview entitled

00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:21.220
Jehovah cares for and strengthens faithful ones

00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:27.930
Video please

00:24:27.930 --> 00:24:31.690
Jehovah's care for each of his faithful servants

00:24:31.690 --> 00:24:35.369
Is felt especially during times of difficulty

00:24:35.369 --> 00:24:40.970
The Apostle Paul experienced what he called a thorn in the flesh

00:24:40.970 --> 00:24:44.089
I'd like to read to you what he said about that

00:24:44.089 --> 00:24:50.569
In 2 Corinthians chapter 12 I'll read portions of verses 9 and 10

00:24:50.569 --> 00:24:52.970
Speaking of the Lord he said

00:24:52.970 --> 00:24:55.130
But he said to me

00:24:55.130 --> 00:24:58.730
My undeserved kindness is sufficient for you

00:24:58.730 --> 00:25:04.730
For my power is being made perfect in weakness

00:25:04.730 --> 00:25:09.450
Verse 10 So I take pleasure in weaknesses

00:25:09.450 --> 00:25:14.569
And difficulties for Christ for when I am weak

00:25:14.569 --> 00:25:17.130
Then I am powerful

00:25:17.130 --> 00:25:23.210
While it's the responsibility of each one to give balanced attention to their health

00:25:23.210 --> 00:25:26.809
Still there are problems that arise

00:25:26.809 --> 00:25:31.450
Therefore the governing body has made arrangements for all branches to assist

00:25:31.450 --> 00:25:35.289
Special full-time servants with their health care needs

00:25:35.289 --> 00:25:39.210
And that is within the circumstances of each branch

00:25:39.210 --> 00:25:45.450
The United States branch is privileged to have a group of dedicated brothers and sisters

00:25:45.450 --> 00:25:47.849
Who render such care

00:25:47.849 --> 00:25:52.250
We're going to talk to nine of our physicians serving at Bethel

00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:55.609
And we're going to introduce them alphabetically

00:25:55.609 --> 00:25:59.130
First we have Brother Samuel Raibowachi

00:25:59.130 --> 00:26:02.809
Who's been serving us for 11 years at Bethel

00:26:02.809 --> 00:26:08.170
Brother Jack Carlton who's been with us for 40 years

00:26:08.170 --> 00:26:12.730
It's hard to believe because Jack claims he's 39

00:26:12.730 --> 00:26:16.970
Anna Marie Correa who's been with us for three years

00:26:16.970 --> 00:26:20.809
Enrique Corvallon for eight years

00:26:20.809 --> 00:26:24.730
And Brother Walter Ferguson for 30 years

00:26:24.730 --> 00:26:28.650
Luis Garza 26 years

00:26:28.650 --> 00:26:32.569
Brother James Harper for 26 years

00:26:32.569 --> 00:26:35.609
Brother James Howard for 28 years

00:26:35.609 --> 00:26:38.970
And Olga Manson for 15 years

00:26:38.970 --> 00:26:41.930
What a wonderful representative group

00:26:41.930 --> 00:26:48.329
But I'd like to ask you dear folks to share with us your experience of learning the truth

00:26:48.329 --> 00:26:51.690
And how that impacted your profession

00:26:51.690 --> 00:26:54.809
And Brother Carlton would you please start off with it

00:26:54.809 --> 00:26:57.930
The truth was introduced through the door to door ministry

00:26:57.930 --> 00:27:03.130
I was doing research at the National Institutes of Health in Washington D.C. and the Cancer Institute

00:27:03.130 --> 00:27:05.289
And planning to go on into neurosurgery

00:27:05.289 --> 00:27:07.609
But the knock came in the door the brother came in

00:27:07.609 --> 00:27:10.970
And he presented the kingdom hope from Genesis to Revelation

00:27:10.970 --> 00:27:13.369
And my wife and I said that's marvelous

00:27:13.369 --> 00:27:16.170
To live forever on earth and have no sickness

00:27:16.170 --> 00:27:18.730
And enjoy peace and security forever

00:27:18.730 --> 00:27:19.690
What a wonderful hope

00:27:19.769 --> 00:27:20.970
And then he had to do that

00:27:20.970 --> 00:27:22.569
You know that God has a name

00:27:22.569 --> 00:27:26.009
And we didn't know that so now to be to know Jehovah personally

00:27:26.009 --> 00:27:27.849
It touched us and that's all it took

00:27:27.849 --> 00:27:30.650
From that time on we wanted to be in full-time service

00:27:30.650 --> 00:27:32.890
And aid Bethel if we could in the future

00:27:33.609 --> 00:27:35.529
Very interesting, thank you

00:27:35.529 --> 00:27:38.410
And Sister Correa, Anna Marie, what about yourself?

00:27:39.369 --> 00:27:44.490
Well I started to study the Bible in my last year of medical school

00:27:44.490 --> 00:27:47.930
And then went on to work part time as a doctor

00:27:47.930 --> 00:27:53.769
To be able to regular pioneer with my husband from 1997 till 2009

00:27:54.569 --> 00:27:57.849
In 2009 I stopped practicing medicine

00:27:57.849 --> 00:28:02.009
To expend my ministry in the Hindi congregation in Montreal

00:28:02.009 --> 00:28:04.809
Until I was called to Bethel in 2013

00:28:04.809 --> 00:28:06.809
Wonderful and we're glad you're here too

00:28:07.609 --> 00:28:10.250
Walter, share with us your experience please

00:28:10.970 --> 00:28:14.089
I was contacted in the Dorded Orwork in Buffalo, New York

00:28:14.089 --> 00:28:17.609
I had a very good effective Bible teacher

00:28:17.690 --> 00:28:22.890
Who was able to help to revive in me a spiritual interest

00:28:23.529 --> 00:28:27.769
And I made it a formal study in my last years in medical school

00:28:27.769 --> 00:28:32.410
And it was baptized not long after I graduated from medical school

00:28:33.130 --> 00:28:34.890
Excellent, thank you

00:28:34.890 --> 00:28:39.130
Luis Garza from Monterey, Mexico

00:28:40.650 --> 00:28:42.490
Tell us about your experience

00:28:43.289 --> 00:28:50.250
My first contact with the truth was after I had been practicing medicine for 16 years

00:28:52.089 --> 00:28:57.769
A patient of mine came with a sore throat and two magazines and she was a jihad witness

00:28:58.809 --> 00:29:01.049
At that time I was having some

00:29:03.130 --> 00:29:09.529
Scary experiences where the demons were involved although I was not looking for them

00:29:10.089 --> 00:29:14.250
And I was endlessly praying to God for help

00:29:14.250 --> 00:29:18.250
I didn't know his name but I knew he existed

00:29:19.210 --> 00:29:25.049
And at that time the patient came and one of the magazines had on the front cover

00:29:25.609 --> 00:29:28.650
With big letters the word spiritism

00:29:29.690 --> 00:29:32.890
So first I said I don't want anything with that

00:29:32.890 --> 00:29:37.049
I already have enough problems but she said this is to protect yourself

00:29:38.009 --> 00:29:42.410
Not to practice it so I took the magazines read them and

00:29:43.369 --> 00:29:50.009
After that a local elder started studying the Bible with me and that's how I came into the truth

00:29:50.410 --> 00:29:54.410
Beautiful and we're so glad to have you serving us at Bethel

00:29:55.210 --> 00:29:57.210
and brother Harper

00:29:57.849 --> 00:30:04.809
I requested a Bible study immediately after finishing high school at age 18 and

00:30:05.609 --> 00:30:12.890
Because of the rigorous pre-medical program that I was involved with it was difficult to continue my study

00:30:13.369 --> 00:30:15.690
I restarted a few years later

00:30:16.329 --> 00:30:21.529
And my formal graduation from medical school was one week after my baptism

00:30:22.089 --> 00:30:25.130
When I came to Bethel I offered to come one week a month

00:30:26.329 --> 00:30:28.329
commuting from Atlanta, Georgia

00:30:28.890 --> 00:30:30.890
And so I did that for

00:30:31.450 --> 00:30:33.930
Six months they asked me to come to Bethel

00:30:34.730 --> 00:30:37.690
full-time and I did that six months later and

00:30:38.730 --> 00:30:40.730
Have been at Bethel ever since

00:30:40.730 --> 00:30:42.730
That's an interesting sideline you

00:30:42.730 --> 00:30:46.329
Commuted from Atlanta, Georgia for a year

00:30:47.130 --> 00:30:53.849
Beautiful and brother Howard help us with the situation that you were faced with when you were introduced to the truth

00:30:54.329 --> 00:30:56.329
When my wife and I learned the truth and

00:30:56.809 --> 00:30:59.930
Immediately that changed our attitude towards

00:31:00.730 --> 00:31:03.210
What was important in life and I was able to

00:31:03.849 --> 00:31:12.809
Cut down to part-time work because it was just really a means of supporting my family then and auxiliary pioneer on a regular basis and then

00:31:13.930 --> 00:31:17.930
Planning to become a regular pioneer, but then in 1983

00:31:18.650 --> 00:31:20.250
Bethel

00:31:20.250 --> 00:31:26.250
Call us and and invited us to come in for me to serve as a medical doctor because there was a great need

00:31:26.650 --> 00:31:31.049
Within three months we had a solar house. I left my practice and

00:31:31.690 --> 00:31:34.490
And with our ten-year-old daughter we came to broken Bethel

00:31:35.609 --> 00:31:37.609
and today that

00:31:37.609 --> 00:31:41.930
Daughter is a Bethel sister married to a responsible brother

00:31:42.569 --> 00:31:45.849
They're serving here together. So the families together in their service

00:31:46.569 --> 00:31:52.250
We appreciate that now. We want to move into an area that's a little bit more sobering

00:31:53.529 --> 00:31:57.930
You deal with the family who are very sick sometimes terminally ill

00:31:58.730 --> 00:32:04.569
Sam right. How are you affected personally when you are exposed to that? Well

00:32:05.529 --> 00:32:07.690
Seven as a Bethel physician

00:32:07.690 --> 00:32:11.690
Definitely is a unique privilege, but also a challenging one

00:32:12.170 --> 00:32:14.329
because unlike physicians on the outside

00:32:15.210 --> 00:32:17.769
Who are detached from their patients?

00:32:18.490 --> 00:32:23.210
We have an attachment with our patients who are also our family members

00:32:23.849 --> 00:32:26.809
and to even make it more difficult

00:32:27.529 --> 00:32:30.170
It's when you have to endure them through

00:32:30.730 --> 00:32:33.930
Terminal illnesses or even be the one to give them the diagnosis

00:32:34.490 --> 00:32:37.049
bad diagnosis grip one and then

00:32:38.089 --> 00:32:45.769
And when you've gone through all the difficult situation with them to be the one to pronounce them as clinically dead

00:32:46.730 --> 00:32:54.089
You know even though we know that we're going to see them back in the new world. So I can really rent your heart out

00:32:54.730 --> 00:32:56.089
For me

00:32:56.970 --> 00:33:01.369
Coming to Bethel was a complete new experience in medical care

00:33:02.089 --> 00:33:07.369
The you're treating essentially your brothers and sisters that they become your family

00:33:07.369 --> 00:33:12.410
So your emotional involvement and commitment is it's much deeper

00:33:13.450 --> 00:33:21.930
Uh, I recall the words of my father. He said a physician tends to treat his patients with his brain or his head

00:33:22.890 --> 00:33:26.009
Uh, but he treats his family with a heart

00:33:27.529 --> 00:33:33.049
And here where in this duality that we have patients but our patients are our family

00:33:33.529 --> 00:33:35.529
The brothers and sisters

00:33:35.529 --> 00:33:39.049
So how to deal with that? It's very difficult

00:33:39.690 --> 00:33:47.930
So one of the things that really helps me to be able to work with this situation is with Paul said in collotions 414

00:33:48.890 --> 00:33:54.410
About Luke and he was the beloved physician. So there are two words in there

00:33:54.890 --> 00:33:57.849
Physician medical care. It was given the medical care

00:33:58.329 --> 00:34:00.730
But as a in a loving way

00:34:01.289 --> 00:34:07.049
So that can be done and that really inspires me to be able to provide to my patients the best

00:34:08.250 --> 00:34:10.809
Medical care with tender affection

00:34:12.010 --> 00:34:14.489
As physicians we don't want to see

00:34:14.730 --> 00:34:17.050
Uh, people suffering

00:34:17.929 --> 00:34:22.889
And uh, uh, whenever we are dealing with our dear brothers and sisters

00:34:24.010 --> 00:34:30.010
It's different. It's our family and treating our family is more difficult

00:34:30.570 --> 00:34:40.090
Talking to patients about what they are facing pain, suffering and even terminal incurable diseases

00:34:40.969 --> 00:34:45.449
This makes my occupation stressful and emotionally charged

00:34:46.489 --> 00:34:49.530
Especially when I have to break bad news

00:34:50.489 --> 00:34:57.769
But um, at those times, be seeking Jehovah in prayer asking for strength and wisdom

00:34:58.969 --> 00:35:03.929
Um, also having the support of my overseers at the infirmary

00:35:04.409 --> 00:35:07.130
They accompany me sometimes to

00:35:07.769 --> 00:35:10.730
Talk about critical issues to the patients

00:35:11.449 --> 00:35:14.250
And they pray even for that for me and for them

00:35:15.050 --> 00:35:17.449
So even though it's stressful

00:35:18.250 --> 00:35:21.050
I never feel overwhelmed

00:35:21.690 --> 00:35:23.289
Hmm, very interesting

00:35:24.010 --> 00:35:27.849
Now going in another direction on the other side of this

00:35:28.969 --> 00:35:30.969
Uh, how do you stay positive

00:35:31.530 --> 00:35:35.369
Despite the negative circumstances that we've just talked about

00:35:36.010 --> 00:35:38.329
Walter, how do you do that?

00:35:39.130 --> 00:35:46.409
Yes, Ralph. Uh, heart disease, breast cancer and prostate cancer are still the leading causes of death in the Bethel family

00:35:47.369 --> 00:35:50.809
In such cases, uh, we stay positive by um

00:35:51.530 --> 00:35:56.250
sharing our absolute confidence in the nearness of Jehovah's promises

00:35:56.809 --> 00:35:58.250
And that tends to be a two-way

00:35:58.969 --> 00:36:00.170
interchange

00:36:00.170 --> 00:36:09.929
We attempt to encourage others, but we are also encouraged by many of these very mature people that we're working with and and they see things very clearly

00:36:11.210 --> 00:36:17.849
And um, we also rejoice because we're able to participate in some of the positive outcomes for the greater majority

00:36:18.650 --> 00:36:21.690
Of the individuals that suffer illness for example

00:36:22.090 --> 00:36:26.329
Majority of our patients with breast cancer are cured more than 90 percent

00:36:26.969 --> 00:36:30.409
And uh in prostate cancer the majority are cured

00:36:30.409 --> 00:36:37.289
But there's also a large portion that live a long time with their disease of productive life with their disease

00:36:37.690 --> 00:36:40.730
So that uh helps us uh the positive outcomes

00:36:40.730 --> 00:36:47.369
But also with heart disease we're now having much better outcomes people are living more productive lives and

00:36:47.849 --> 00:36:49.610
Actually living longer

00:36:49.610 --> 00:36:58.489
Additionally the Bethel environment is a very positive place to develop spiritual qualities such as this and we get help from the Bethel table

00:36:59.130 --> 00:37:01.369
they deal with um

00:37:01.369 --> 00:37:04.010
Faith based on facts and it helps up

00:37:04.570 --> 00:37:10.969
Persons who are with a scientific orientation. It helps us to know that our faith is very sound

00:37:12.090 --> 00:37:13.849
I think of three factors

00:37:13.929 --> 00:37:20.889
The one is having a loving spouse nilus all of it and the family always supportive of being me available 24 hours a day

00:37:21.210 --> 00:37:23.210
Seven days a week to the Bethel family

00:37:23.530 --> 00:37:28.250
And then the love that we have as a team our nurses all those that work in the infirmary

00:37:28.650 --> 00:37:35.929
We have such a bond of love between us and the patient it it sustains us and and that's a beautiful thing to see

00:37:36.329 --> 00:37:42.409
And then Jehovah spirit the joy we get from that spirit the joy we pass on to our patients the trust we have in Jehovah

00:37:42.809 --> 00:37:48.329
The security we have and that powerful force the greatest the universe helps me through as it does the patients

00:37:49.210 --> 00:37:55.610
And I think he speaks for all of you when you say you really appreciate the support the nurses the PCA's

00:37:56.329 --> 00:38:01.210
all of the staff uh give you i've heard you comment on that many times. Thank you brother jack

00:38:01.849 --> 00:38:05.369
Let's go to brother Harper. How would you respond to this?

00:38:06.010 --> 00:38:09.449
keeping positive in spite of the things you have to deal with?

00:38:10.010 --> 00:38:13.130
I focus on the positive uh the

00:38:13.769 --> 00:38:16.730
things that we can do for the patient to make them

00:38:17.210 --> 00:38:22.010
Have a better quality of life and that gives us some personal satisfaction

00:38:23.289 --> 00:38:29.130
The other thing is that we concentrate on the positive by means of what the scriptures tells us

00:38:29.610 --> 00:38:34.889
About the fact that all of these things only temporary. I look at uh Jesus

00:38:35.050 --> 00:38:36.090
uh

00:38:36.090 --> 00:38:38.809
Even though he was about to cure

00:38:39.610 --> 00:38:42.170
Lazarus and he knew what he was going to do

00:38:42.650 --> 00:38:46.650
He still broke out crying and why did he do that?

00:38:47.050 --> 00:38:52.889
Because he felt the pain that they were enduring and we feel it too. So it's okay to cry

00:38:53.610 --> 00:38:58.730
But we know that the end result will be for the benefit of everybody

00:39:00.650 --> 00:39:01.690
Hope

00:39:01.690 --> 00:39:03.690
I think just the fact that I

00:39:04.170 --> 00:39:06.650
Remember that this situation is temporary

00:39:07.369 --> 00:39:12.570
Uh the hillness of the friend and one verse that I really really like is uh

00:39:12.570 --> 00:39:17.130
Revelation 21 verse 4 where at the end it says um

00:39:18.010 --> 00:39:20.250
All things have passed away

00:39:20.250 --> 00:39:23.849
So we won't remember any of those things although it's hard right now

00:39:24.329 --> 00:39:26.969
It's not something we will live with in the future

00:39:27.929 --> 00:39:34.809
The thing that really helps me and great deal is is to see the the faith and the love for Jehovah in

00:39:35.530 --> 00:39:38.809
Patients who have a serious very painful

00:39:39.690 --> 00:39:46.889
Terminal illness I see that they love Jehovah and that's crystal clear like a diamond that uh that

00:39:47.690 --> 00:39:54.329
Love and faith in Jehovah and it really strengthens my faith no matter how much they're suffering

00:39:54.650 --> 00:40:01.849
And they know that they're going to be resurrected. There's no doubt whatsoever in their minds that in in the words of

00:40:02.170 --> 00:40:04.170
Hosea 13-14

00:40:04.409 --> 00:40:07.289
Where are your stings? Oh death. There's one

00:40:08.250 --> 00:40:09.690
sister of

00:40:09.690 --> 00:40:13.530
longtime missionary who was dying of a very painful

00:40:14.489 --> 00:40:23.769
cancer rapidly progressive cancer and she'd been healthy all her life until then and she had a complete faith in the resurrection and

00:40:24.969 --> 00:40:29.929
One of her last words expressions was uh, I never died before

00:40:30.329 --> 00:40:32.489
I didn't know it'd be so hard

00:40:32.489 --> 00:40:34.489
But she knew what was coming after that

00:40:34.730 --> 00:40:35.690
Hmm

00:40:35.690 --> 00:40:37.690
That's a touching experience

00:40:38.170 --> 00:40:43.289
Last question. Can you share your comments about looking forward to the time when

00:40:43.929 --> 00:40:45.929
You'll no longer have your jobs

00:40:47.289 --> 00:40:51.849
In the new world we won't need this work. Well, what do you think about that? The rye

00:40:52.730 --> 00:41:00.889
Well, I particularly look forward to a time that I wouldn't have to be working up in the night, you know to care for

00:41:02.570 --> 00:41:04.570
Dear ones who are in pain

00:41:04.570 --> 00:41:12.489
Know back and have the time to enjoy a time with my dear wife in the new world and pursue skills as drawing painting

00:41:12.969 --> 00:41:20.090
Designing beautiful buildings and you know enjoying the art and music into eternity with my wife and I look

00:41:20.809 --> 00:41:24.170
Forward very much to that so I can easily let this go

00:41:25.289 --> 00:41:29.449
For several years rye has been asking to work in the art department

00:41:31.210 --> 00:41:33.210
So you'll have your day

00:41:34.250 --> 00:41:36.250
So promise

00:41:36.489 --> 00:41:38.489
Brother Carlton, please

00:41:38.809 --> 00:41:40.809
New world no more physician

00:41:41.690 --> 00:41:43.690
That will be a wonderful day

00:41:43.849 --> 00:41:46.489
Uh, there I think I look forward to those who haven't been able to help

00:41:46.969 --> 00:41:51.769
Then I can welcome back I'll be young and they'll be young and that'll be a beautiful time

00:41:52.010 --> 00:41:58.730
But the peace and security that the world holds see the creation the the birth sounds of birds nothing man made interfering with

00:41:59.210 --> 00:42:00.170
noises

00:42:00.170 --> 00:42:05.369
But seeing the animals play and learning about the the plants and having my own garden

00:42:06.090 --> 00:42:08.090
Family had together doing these things

00:42:09.530 --> 00:42:11.530
Sister Anna Marie

00:42:11.690 --> 00:42:14.969
We are often asked to imagine ourself in the new system

00:42:15.530 --> 00:42:19.769
And for me, it's never been like a specific house or a place

00:42:20.329 --> 00:42:22.329
But it's always been to know that

00:42:22.570 --> 00:42:27.210
Everybody wakes up in the morning. They're happy. They don't have any pain

00:42:27.769 --> 00:42:34.250
They're ready for a full day of activity for me. That's the new system and I'm ready to go there

00:42:35.610 --> 00:42:38.969
Thank you and in reekay Corvallon, please

00:42:40.969 --> 00:42:44.489
Here in this side of the of life we can say

00:42:45.369 --> 00:42:47.369
We

00:42:47.369 --> 00:42:49.849
Treat and take care of our friends

00:42:50.889 --> 00:42:53.449
They could be an illness severe minor

00:42:54.250 --> 00:42:58.170
But uh the end is all death

00:42:59.369 --> 00:43:00.889
So

00:43:00.969 --> 00:43:07.690
On the new system what I'm looking for is that it's not going to be any illness or diseases and on top of that we're all to

00:43:08.730 --> 00:43:13.449
See the ones who we have left because they are gone into death come back

00:43:14.090 --> 00:43:15.289
Not leaving

00:43:15.289 --> 00:43:17.289
But coming back coming back to life

00:43:17.849 --> 00:43:21.050
So I'm looking forward to be able to be eventually one of the

00:43:21.610 --> 00:43:23.050
Reception committee

00:43:23.050 --> 00:43:25.050
Yeah, waking and

00:43:25.690 --> 00:43:31.050
Receiving those brothers and sisters and family members dear family members that we have lost in death

00:43:32.250 --> 00:43:34.250
Beautiful beautiful thought Walter

00:43:34.969 --> 00:43:36.489
no more

00:43:36.489 --> 00:43:39.530
Doctering new world. What do you say?

00:43:40.489 --> 00:43:43.289
I don't think I'll have any problem with that at all in fact

00:43:44.489 --> 00:43:48.969
We have so many beautiful brothers and sisters that your hopes created with mine said

00:43:49.369 --> 00:43:53.050
We now be able to employ them in more useful activities

00:43:53.849 --> 00:43:58.170
But I think for me the most important thing I think would be that

00:43:58.889 --> 00:44:00.489
in the new system

00:44:00.489 --> 00:44:02.570
I'll be able to

00:44:02.570 --> 00:44:05.369
Learn and associate more with Jehovah

00:44:06.010 --> 00:44:09.210
Without the distractions we have today and I think that's going to be

00:44:09.530 --> 00:44:13.849
Marvelous hope to open up for for everyone and I certainly look forward to that

00:44:14.570 --> 00:44:16.570
profound thought. Thank you and

00:44:17.210 --> 00:44:19.210
Dear brother Luis Garza

00:44:20.170 --> 00:44:28.170
I will be extremely happy to give up the practice of medicine in the new world with all these promises that Jehovah

00:44:29.130 --> 00:44:31.130
Has made for us

00:44:32.170 --> 00:44:34.650
We will not need the practice of medicine

00:44:35.369 --> 00:44:36.889
Thank you

00:44:36.889 --> 00:44:38.889
And James Harper

00:44:38.889 --> 00:44:47.849
I look so forward to the fulfillment of Jehovah's promises. I just can't wait and actually I look forward to giving up this assignment

00:44:47.929 --> 00:44:51.610
But many people in the past have said well you won't have a job

00:44:52.090 --> 00:44:59.929
I'm not concerned because Jehovah won't let me go unemployed. He'll give me a very interesting and challenging assignment. I'm sure

00:45:01.050 --> 00:45:04.250
Very good. Thank you and brother Howard

00:45:05.130 --> 00:45:06.570
peace

00:45:06.570 --> 00:45:08.889
nature animals music

00:45:09.849 --> 00:45:11.690
happy people

00:45:11.690 --> 00:45:13.690
All loving Jehovah and loved by him

00:45:14.650 --> 00:45:22.170
Working together to serve him. I just want to be there and sister Olga Benson

00:45:23.530 --> 00:45:25.530
When Jesus was on earth

00:45:26.329 --> 00:45:32.650
He did powerful works of curing the sick and resurrecting the dead

00:45:33.449 --> 00:45:35.769
And to me that is an evidence

00:45:36.809 --> 00:45:41.050
That Jehovah and Jesus are very interested in our health

00:45:41.769 --> 00:45:46.170
And also that they are better doctors than I could ever be

00:45:47.130 --> 00:45:50.090
So I can't wait to be out of a job

00:45:52.489 --> 00:45:55.289
And I think every one of us agree with every one of you

00:45:56.010 --> 00:45:58.489
We yearn for the day when you will not be doctors

00:45:59.050 --> 00:46:00.250
Yeah

00:46:00.250 --> 00:46:02.250
But in the meantime we want to thank you

00:46:03.289 --> 00:46:06.409
Uh, not just for your expressions today, but for your

00:46:07.369 --> 00:46:10.409
dedicated view of your sacred service at Bethel

00:46:11.210 --> 00:46:12.889
As physicians

00:46:12.889 --> 00:46:17.849
In fact, we're grateful for the entire medical staff and I know when we talked about this before

00:46:18.730 --> 00:46:21.050
You dear folks and your comments applauded

00:46:21.690 --> 00:46:23.849
Those who support you and your work

00:46:24.889 --> 00:46:29.369
We appreciate that you're willing to use your training not for selfish pursuits

00:46:30.170 --> 00:46:32.170
But for kingdom interests

00:46:32.409 --> 00:46:34.250
But even more than that we appreciate

00:46:34.809 --> 00:46:37.769
What we've seen here among you and that's your deep

00:46:38.250 --> 00:46:39.769
spirituality

00:46:39.769 --> 00:46:43.369
It's so evident and and we we thank you for that

00:46:44.489 --> 00:46:47.530
So you've given not only your skills, but as Paul mentions

00:46:48.250 --> 00:46:50.730
And first that's only in two eight

00:46:50.969 --> 00:46:54.329
You remember there? He says we've given our very souls

00:46:55.050 --> 00:46:58.090
And that's what you dear folks have done most of all

00:46:59.050 --> 00:47:01.050
Who do you think we thank

00:47:01.210 --> 00:47:02.409
Jehovah

00:47:02.409 --> 00:47:03.449
why

00:47:03.449 --> 00:47:05.530
Because he cares for faithful ones

00:47:06.250 --> 00:47:09.690
And he strengthens such ones including yourselves

00:47:10.489 --> 00:47:12.250
I'd like to read what Paul said

00:47:13.130 --> 00:47:17.849
In one of his letters to a congregation. I'd like for you dear folks to hear it in the context

00:47:18.570 --> 00:47:21.449
Of all of us saying this about you

00:47:22.489 --> 00:47:24.489
We always thank God

00:47:24.570 --> 00:47:26.969
What do we mention all of you

00:47:26.969 --> 00:47:29.849
For we continually remember your faithful work

00:47:30.650 --> 00:47:33.610
Your loving labor and your endurance

00:47:34.090 --> 00:47:36.250
And all of us you're in for the time when

00:47:36.889 --> 00:47:41.610
No resident in the entire earth will say I am sick

00:47:42.409 --> 00:47:54.699
Thank you very much

00:47:54.699 --> 00:47:57.179
That was indeed a unique interview

00:47:58.539 --> 00:48:03.980
And we appreciate their love for Jehovah and their love for their fellow servants

00:48:04.780 --> 00:48:07.179
And the loving way in which they use their talents

00:48:08.139 --> 00:48:14.139
It's also unique in that they will all lose their jobs in the near future

00:48:15.340 --> 00:48:17.019
They seem to be happy for that though

00:48:20.150 --> 00:48:27.349
I would just like to mention that this interview was featuring the United States branches medical provisions

00:48:28.550 --> 00:48:35.190
While it's true that all branches around the world have arrangements in place to care for their Bethel families

00:48:35.750 --> 00:48:37.269
Medical needs

00:48:37.269 --> 00:48:45.750
The doctors interviewed just now take care of over 4,500 members of the Bethel family here in the United States

00:48:46.070 --> 00:48:48.550
including long-term

00:48:49.190 --> 00:48:51.190
members of the family and

00:48:51.670 --> 00:48:53.670
temporary volunteers

00:48:54.389 --> 00:49:00.949
The cost to provide outside doctor care for that many people would be very very expensive

00:49:01.829 --> 00:49:06.469
Especially since medical costs in the United States are so high

00:49:07.429 --> 00:49:15.670
However, these doctors just interviewed received the same small monthly allowance as all other Bethel family members

00:49:17.849 --> 00:49:22.809
This has saved hundreds of thousands of dollars of contributed funds each year

00:49:24.329 --> 00:49:27.610
So we would like to thank the doctors for their fine spirit and

00:49:28.329 --> 00:49:33.289
All of those working with the infirmaries for their skills and efficiency

00:49:34.090 --> 00:49:38.170
But above all we thank them for their warm brotherly affection

00:49:39.530 --> 00:49:41.210
When we are

00:49:41.210 --> 00:49:43.210
Often filling our worse

00:49:44.570 --> 00:49:47.210
You're a good medical caregivers

00:49:48.570 --> 00:49:52.650
And we want you to know that you do good work

00:49:54.010 --> 00:49:56.010
You're definitely needed

00:49:57.130 --> 00:50:02.420
For now

00:50:02.420 --> 00:50:07.349
Oh, by the way if any of these doctors

00:50:08.710 --> 00:50:10.710
Are any other doctor

00:50:11.510 --> 00:50:14.389
Should ask you to please stick out your tongue

00:50:15.590 --> 00:50:17.829
Don't try to swallow it stick it out

00:50:19.030 --> 00:50:21.030
They're just trying to help us

00:50:21.909 --> 00:50:23.909
Even though you're not in Tibet

00:50:27.829 --> 00:50:34.340
Well, it's time for you to stand that is if you're able

00:50:35.139 --> 00:50:37.380
And sing out joyfully to Jehovah

00:50:38.579 --> 00:50:43.059
Since none of you have the new songbook with this new numbering system

00:50:43.619 --> 00:50:48.500
We're going to use the song numbers from the song book you currently have access to

00:50:49.539 --> 00:50:54.500
It is one of our new songs the number we have been using is song number

00:50:55.300 --> 00:51:00.659
152 our strength our hope our confidence

00:54:15.590 --> 00:54:19.190
We now will enjoy a number of talks from members of the governing body

00:54:19.909 --> 00:54:22.710
Brother David explain is ready to present his talk

00:54:23.349 --> 00:54:25.750
Trust in Jehovah and do what is good

00:54:26.710 --> 00:54:31.989
Brother explain our ears are ready to hear what your tongue has to say

00:54:34.440 --> 00:54:40.570
We'll see

00:54:40.570 --> 00:54:42.809
Jehovah

00:54:42.809 --> 00:54:46.730
Created all of us with some remarkable abilities

00:54:48.329 --> 00:54:53.690
He gave us the ability to solve problems and plan for the future

00:54:54.889 --> 00:54:59.050
And he also gave us the ability to carry out our plans

00:54:59.449 --> 00:55:03.130
Now how does he want us to use our abilities

00:55:04.170 --> 00:55:06.409
To benefit others

00:55:06.409 --> 00:55:08.090
Why?

00:55:08.090 --> 00:55:12.250
Because he knows that when we are serving others we're happy

00:55:13.289 --> 00:55:17.050
God loves us and he wants us to be happy

00:55:18.650 --> 00:55:23.369
Now at the same time Jehovah realizes that we all have limitations

00:55:24.489 --> 00:55:27.690
He realizes it but sometimes we don't

00:55:29.050 --> 00:55:33.929
And so all of us have to learn to set reasonable goals for ourselves

00:55:33.929 --> 00:55:40.969
And then to rejoice to be happy when we have achieved these goals now some really have to learn that

00:55:41.849 --> 00:55:44.010
They're never satisfied

00:55:44.010 --> 00:55:46.170
They never have enough money

00:55:46.170 --> 00:55:48.650
They never have enough service privileges

00:55:48.650 --> 00:55:52.090
They always want more more more and what's the result?

00:55:52.730 --> 00:55:54.730
They're never happy

00:55:54.809 --> 00:55:57.210
We have to be able to rejoice

00:55:57.849 --> 00:56:03.369
over what we can do and not fret over what we cannot do

00:56:05.289 --> 00:56:08.170
Now if our goals are in line with Jehovah's purpose

00:56:08.809 --> 00:56:11.289
We could be sure that he will back us up

00:56:11.289 --> 00:56:15.289
In fact, the writer of the 37th song was convinced of this

00:56:15.289 --> 00:56:18.889
Here's a man who had personal experience with Jehovah

00:56:18.889 --> 00:56:23.530
And he knew how Jehovah would back him up if he put his trust in him

00:56:23.610 --> 00:56:27.369
Let's read a song 37 verse 3

00:56:29.210 --> 00:56:35.530
And here we see that the writer is speaking to us from personal experience

00:56:36.969 --> 00:56:44.650
He says trust in Jehovah and do what is good

00:56:45.369 --> 00:56:47.289
Well, that's the theme of this talk, isn't it?

00:56:47.929 --> 00:56:52.010
Reside in the earth and act with faithfulness

00:56:54.519 --> 00:56:58.519
The 37th song was written by David of Bethlehem

00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:01.159
And apparently near the end of his life

00:57:01.800 --> 00:57:08.119
Because he wrote I was once young and now I am old

00:57:10.199 --> 00:57:13.800
Now David was only 70 when he died

00:57:14.199 --> 00:57:17.239
So I think some of us would object to that characterization

00:57:18.280 --> 00:57:22.039
I can just about hear brother heard say who are you calling old

00:57:24.280 --> 00:57:27.800
We can still hear crickets chirping and birds singing

00:57:28.760 --> 00:57:32.679
But let's say that David was speaking from his own experience

00:57:33.239 --> 00:57:37.800
And he's sharing his experience as a mature man with us

00:57:38.440 --> 00:57:43.480
He wants us to benefit from the things that happened to him in his lifetime

00:57:44.199 --> 00:57:46.360
And what a life David led

00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:51.800
So for the next few minutes we're going to review a few highlights of David's life

00:57:51.960 --> 00:57:55.000
And we're going to see how David's life

00:57:55.960 --> 00:57:59.159
Was really directed by his trust in Jehovah

00:57:59.239 --> 00:58:04.760
At Jehovah God was guiding him every step of the way and it's a real benefit for us

00:58:05.719 --> 00:58:09.079
Now do you realize that when David was born

00:58:10.360 --> 00:58:14.920
Saul had been reigning over Israel for 10 years already

00:58:16.199 --> 00:58:18.440
But Jehovah wasn't pleased with Saul

00:58:19.079 --> 00:58:23.320
In fact a much earlier he had sent the prophet Samuel to tell the king

00:58:24.039 --> 00:58:28.119
Jehovah will find a man agreeable to his heart

00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:33.000
And Jehovah will commission him as a leader over his people

00:58:33.800 --> 00:58:37.559
Because you did not obey what Jehovah commanded you

00:58:39.239 --> 00:58:41.239
Now that was Jehovah's promise to Saul

00:58:42.199 --> 00:58:44.599
But he didn't carry it out right away

00:58:45.159 --> 00:58:48.920
He didn't provide for Saul's replacement right away

00:58:49.079 --> 00:58:52.519
In fact it was probably more than a quarter century

00:58:53.159 --> 00:58:57.559
Before David was anointed as the future king of Israel

00:58:57.719 --> 00:59:01.960
And maybe Saul thought that Jehovah had forgotten all about replacing him

00:59:02.760 --> 00:59:06.280
But Jehovah hadn't and David was anointed

00:59:07.639 --> 00:59:09.639
Now it was sometime after that

00:59:10.440 --> 00:59:17.320
That a Philistine from Gath the giant Goliath challenged the battle lines of the living God

00:59:17.880 --> 00:59:21.239
Choose for yourselves a man that he might fight with me

00:59:22.599 --> 00:59:25.719
Young David was visiting the camp and he overheard this

00:59:26.360 --> 00:59:31.639
And he couldn't understand why none of the Israelite soldiers were willing to take up the challenge

00:59:31.880 --> 00:59:33.880
And so he expressed his concern

00:59:34.360 --> 00:59:39.000
And his oldest brother Eliab heard what David was saying

00:59:39.639 --> 00:59:42.280
And he rebuked his younger brother

00:59:42.280 --> 00:59:45.639
Well older brothers have a tendency of doing that don't they

00:59:46.199 --> 00:59:50.519
We read about the conversation in 1 Samuel chapter 17

00:59:54.010 --> 00:59:55.530
And we're going to make a point with this

00:59:59.190 --> 01:00:06.150
1 Samuel chapter 17

01:00:08.420 --> 01:00:10.420
verses 28 and 29

01:00:14.019 --> 01:00:17.300
When his oldest brother Eliab heard him speak to the man

01:00:17.940 --> 01:00:20.099
He became angry with David and said

01:00:20.579 --> 01:00:25.300
Why have you come down and with whom did you leave those few sheep in the wilderness?

01:00:26.019 --> 01:00:30.500
I well know your presumptuousness and the bad intentions of your heart

01:00:31.300 --> 01:00:33.780
You came down just to see the battle

01:00:34.980 --> 01:00:37.860
To this David said what have I done now?

01:00:38.659 --> 01:00:40.659
I was only asking a question

01:00:41.860 --> 01:00:44.500
Isn't the wording of that realistic?

01:00:44.659 --> 01:00:47.139
Isn't that what you would hear in your own family?

01:00:49.900 --> 01:00:52.219
Now what was the problem with Eliab?

01:00:53.500 --> 01:00:56.059
He was viewing David according to the flesh

01:00:58.059 --> 01:01:01.500
To Eliab David was still his pesky little brother

01:01:02.780 --> 01:01:04.940
But he should have known better why?

01:01:06.059 --> 01:01:08.699
Because Eliab had been present earlier

01:01:09.340 --> 01:01:13.420
When Samuel had anointed David as the future king of Israel

01:01:14.139 --> 01:01:18.139
Now the current king of Israel wasn't willing to take up the challenge that

01:01:18.139 --> 01:01:19.420
Eliab threw out

01:01:19.980 --> 01:01:23.099
So wasn't it only reasonable that the next in line to the throne

01:01:23.579 --> 01:01:24.780
Should take up the challenge?

01:01:24.780 --> 01:01:28.940
There was nothing presumptuous about what David was doing

01:01:29.179 --> 01:01:29.980
And I'll picture this

01:01:30.940 --> 01:01:32.940
Here you have on the one hand David

01:01:34.139 --> 01:01:35.340
A shepherd

01:01:35.420 --> 01:01:36.940
Probably in his teens

01:01:37.739 --> 01:01:38.940
And on the other

01:01:38.940 --> 01:01:42.059
Goliath saw a seasoned warrior

01:01:42.699 --> 01:01:44.699
Probably in his late 60s

01:01:45.659 --> 01:01:50.619
And we have to ask what did David have that Saul was lacking?

01:01:52.300 --> 01:01:53.500
Trust

01:01:54.059 --> 01:01:56.059
Trust in Jehovah

01:01:57.179 --> 01:02:00.780
David was going to work with Jehovah on this assignment

01:02:01.260 --> 01:02:04.219
But David realized that trust alone was not enough

01:02:04.219 --> 01:02:07.659
You could trust that Jehovah to raise up someone else to fight Goliath

01:02:07.659 --> 01:02:08.699
But that wouldn't do any good

01:02:09.500 --> 01:02:11.099
David wanted to trust in Jehovah

01:02:11.099 --> 01:02:14.219
But he also wanted to do something about it

01:02:14.219 --> 01:02:15.820
To do something good

01:02:17.420 --> 01:02:20.940
But didn't David run the risk of being killed by Goliath?

01:02:22.460 --> 01:02:23.260
Not a chance

01:02:24.139 --> 01:02:25.340
Why?

01:02:26.139 --> 01:02:31.739
Because Jehovah had had David anointed to rule over Israel

01:02:32.300 --> 01:02:34.460
And David hadn't become king yet

01:02:35.340 --> 01:02:38.940
Do you think that an uncircumcised Philistine like Goliath

01:02:38.940 --> 01:02:40.940
Could stand in the way of Jehovah

01:02:41.579 --> 01:02:43.500
Fulfilling his purpose?

01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:44.619
Never

01:02:44.619 --> 01:02:46.619
Never would that happen

01:02:46.619 --> 01:02:47.420
Neither Goliath

01:02:48.300 --> 01:02:48.940
Nor Saul

01:02:49.659 --> 01:02:52.539
Nor anyone else was going to prevent David

01:02:53.179 --> 01:02:54.699
From becoming the king

01:02:54.699 --> 01:02:55.500
He would live

01:02:56.539 --> 01:02:59.019
As long as he was faithful to Jehovah

01:02:59.980 --> 01:03:03.420
David had complete trust in Jehovah

01:03:04.059 --> 01:03:05.500
And his trust was rewarded

01:03:06.460 --> 01:03:09.019
So he was again drawing on personal experience

01:03:09.019 --> 01:03:11.099
If we turn back to Psalm 37

01:03:12.059 --> 01:03:15.099
We'll be reading quite a bit from Psalm 37 now

01:03:15.099 --> 01:03:17.179
So you can keep your Bibles open there

01:03:17.820 --> 01:03:20.460
He's again drawing on personal experience

01:03:20.460 --> 01:03:23.260
When he writes what we read in verse 5

01:03:23.820 --> 01:03:26.300
So that's Psalm 37 verse 5

01:03:28.300 --> 01:03:30.460
Commit your way to Jehovah

01:03:31.340 --> 01:03:32.619
Relay on him

01:03:33.420 --> 01:03:36.300
And he will act in your behalf

01:03:37.179 --> 01:03:41.820
Now, the Philistines were sworn enemies of Israel

01:03:42.460 --> 01:03:44.460
But David had enemies closer to home

01:03:45.739 --> 01:03:48.300
And he could have become emittered

01:03:48.300 --> 01:03:51.099
To realize that intimate associates of his

01:03:51.099 --> 01:03:53.739
And even family members had betrayed him

01:03:54.619 --> 01:03:57.019
But on the whole, David was a spiritual man

01:03:57.739 --> 01:03:59.019
And we might ask

01:03:59.019 --> 01:04:02.219
How does a spiritual man handle betrayal

01:04:03.019 --> 01:04:04.139
Notice verse 8

01:04:05.099 --> 01:04:08.940
He says, let go of anger

01:04:09.579 --> 01:04:11.179
And abandon rage

01:04:11.980 --> 01:04:14.059
Do not become upset

01:04:14.699 --> 01:04:16.860
And turn to doing evil

01:04:18.539 --> 01:04:21.980
Now, why could David adopt this attitude

01:04:21.980 --> 01:04:23.420
When he was being betrayed

01:04:24.539 --> 01:04:28.059
He had a warm personal relationship with Jehovah God

01:04:28.860 --> 01:04:30.059
He knew his God

01:04:30.940 --> 01:04:33.659
He knew that Jehovah hears everything

01:04:33.739 --> 01:04:35.579
He sees everything

01:04:35.579 --> 01:04:37.820
He knew that God cares

01:04:37.820 --> 01:04:40.139
And notice Psalm 37 18

01:04:43.159 --> 01:04:46.039
David writes, Jehovah is aware

01:04:46.840 --> 01:04:48.840
Of what the blameless go through

01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:49.880
Isn't that reassuring?

01:04:50.679 --> 01:04:53.719
And their inheritance will last forever

01:04:55.239 --> 01:04:56.840
Now David was a strong man

01:04:57.559 --> 01:04:59.079
A valiant warrior

01:04:59.719 --> 01:05:02.679
We recall when David would return from battle

01:05:02.679 --> 01:05:04.360
That the women would sing

01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:06.519
Saul has killed his thousands

01:05:06.519 --> 01:05:07.000
David

01:05:08.119 --> 01:05:09.960
His tens of thousands

01:05:11.079 --> 01:05:14.760
But David did not rely on his military prowess

01:05:15.639 --> 01:05:17.000
In dealing with his enemies

01:05:17.719 --> 01:05:19.880
He turned to Jehovah

01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:23.000
And we find evidence of that in verses 12 and 13

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:24.280
Of the 37th Psalm

01:05:26.119 --> 01:05:30.599
David writes, the wicked man plots against the righteous

01:05:31.159 --> 01:05:33.159
He grinds his teeth at him

01:05:33.960 --> 01:05:37.159
But Jehovah will laugh at him

01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:41.000
For he knows that his day will come

01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:43.639
So there's always this sense with David

01:05:43.639 --> 01:05:45.239
That whatever is happening

01:05:45.239 --> 01:05:46.599
Jehovah sees it

01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:48.440
Jehovah is observing it

01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:51.159
And Jehovah is going to step in

01:05:51.159 --> 01:05:52.360
In due time

01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:54.119
Very encouraging

01:05:54.119 --> 01:05:55.559
And so often in the Psalms

01:05:55.559 --> 01:05:56.599
We've been reading the Psalms

01:05:56.599 --> 01:05:57.800
Now in our Bible reading

01:05:57.800 --> 01:06:00.039
And haven't you noticed so often in the Psalms

01:06:00.760 --> 01:06:02.760
That this strong man

01:06:02.840 --> 01:06:04.760
This rugged man, David

01:06:05.320 --> 01:06:10.519
Beseach his Jehovah to give him a way of escape

01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:12.760
From his enemies

01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:16.119
Know a lot of people in this country

01:06:16.119 --> 01:06:18.599
Will think that that was a coward's act

01:06:19.880 --> 01:06:22.119
In this country there are so many people who say

01:06:22.760 --> 01:06:23.719
Don't give in

01:06:24.199 --> 01:06:25.480
Don't back down

01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:26.920
Stand your ground

01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:27.960
Buy a weapon

01:06:27.960 --> 01:06:29.320
Keep it by your bedside

01:06:30.840 --> 01:06:32.440
Not David

01:06:32.519 --> 01:06:33.639
David

01:06:33.639 --> 01:06:37.559
Took comfort in what we read in verse 28 of Psalm 37

01:06:38.599 --> 01:06:39.800
Jehovah

01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:41.400
Loves justice

01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:44.840
So he placed his case before Jehovah God

01:06:46.920 --> 01:06:49.800
David had to struggle with his conscience

01:06:49.800 --> 01:06:51.800
On more than one occasion

01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:54.360
Do you remember what happened when

01:06:54.360 --> 01:06:56.679
David was running away from Saul

01:06:56.679 --> 01:06:58.519
And he came to a Himalach the priest

01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:02.519
Now a Himalach didn't know that David was a fugitive

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:06.039
And David wasn't interested in letting him know that

01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:08.199
Instead he told the priest

01:07:08.760 --> 01:07:11.400
The king instructed me to do something

01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:12.519
But he said

01:07:12.519 --> 01:07:16.760
Do not let anyone know anything about the mission on which I am sending you

01:07:18.119 --> 01:07:19.719
Well, that wasn't true

01:07:20.840 --> 01:07:24.280
Then David asked for a man for a bread for his men

01:07:24.280 --> 01:07:27.400
And the priest was happy to give him bread and provisions

01:07:28.360 --> 01:07:30.280
Saul found out about it

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:32.199
And he was furious

01:07:33.239 --> 01:07:34.679
He directed that a Himalach

01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:36.440
And his household

01:07:37.079 --> 01:07:38.519
Be put to death

01:07:38.519 --> 01:07:39.320
And in all

01:07:39.960 --> 01:07:41.719
85 priests

01:07:42.840 --> 01:07:43.559
were slaughtered

01:07:45.079 --> 01:07:46.519
A Himalach was deceived

01:07:47.400 --> 01:07:50.119
He thought he was helping an emissary of King Saul

01:07:51.239 --> 01:07:55.639
Do you think he would have been so willing to help if he had known the true situation

01:07:56.599 --> 01:07:57.639
Maybe not

01:07:58.840 --> 01:08:01.400
When those 85 priests are resurrected

01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:04.599
I think David is going to have a little explaining to do

01:08:06.789 --> 01:08:08.869
Well, was David conscience stricken

01:08:10.150 --> 01:08:11.349
You better believe it

01:08:12.389 --> 01:08:15.349
He told a Himalach's only surviving son

01:08:16.229 --> 01:08:21.829
I am personally responsible for the death of everyone in your father's house

01:08:23.109 --> 01:08:24.229
How do you live with that?

01:08:25.189 --> 01:08:29.750
How do you live with being responsible for the death of so many people

01:08:32.020 --> 01:08:34.020
What could David do

01:08:34.579 --> 01:08:36.579
What was done was done

01:08:37.539 --> 01:08:39.060
He couldn't change the past

01:08:40.260 --> 01:08:43.060
Would he become paralyzed with guilt

01:08:43.859 --> 01:08:49.300
overwhelmed by feelings of worthlessness and become inactive in Jehovah's service

01:08:50.500 --> 01:08:52.180
Not David

01:08:52.260 --> 01:08:58.340
What he could do was protect the last remaining member of the house of a Himalach

01:08:58.420 --> 01:09:00.420
And that's exactly what he did

01:09:02.180 --> 01:09:05.380
As we know there were other conscience matters

01:09:06.340 --> 01:09:11.060
David committed adultery with Basheba and had her husband Yeraya killed

01:09:12.020 --> 01:09:13.539
So he sinned against Jehovah

01:09:14.180 --> 01:09:15.779
He sinned against Yeraya

01:09:16.340 --> 01:09:17.539
And he sinned against

01:09:18.500 --> 01:09:19.539
His other wives

01:09:20.420 --> 01:09:22.500
Imagine poor Abigail

01:09:23.380 --> 01:09:28.100
She'd been rescued from one bad marriage and now her new husband had betrayed her

01:09:29.779 --> 01:09:31.140
When his sins came to light

01:09:31.859 --> 01:09:33.140
How did David react

01:09:34.020 --> 01:09:35.539
Well, here's what he could not do

01:09:36.659 --> 01:09:38.899
He could not resurrect Yeraya

01:09:40.020 --> 01:09:43.859
But he could sincerely repent of his sins and he did

01:09:44.659 --> 01:09:46.899
And in turn the prophet Nathan told him

01:09:47.539 --> 01:09:49.779
Jehovah forgives your sin

01:09:51.300 --> 01:09:52.500
What else could David do?

01:09:53.380 --> 01:09:55.380
He could have faith

01:09:55.380 --> 01:10:00.180
Faith that Jehovah really meant it when he said that he forgave his servant

01:10:01.699 --> 01:10:03.699
Well, what about us

01:10:04.340 --> 01:10:09.060
In some cases we may not be able to undo our mistakes in our current lifetime

01:10:09.300 --> 01:10:11.539
We may have to live with the consequences

01:10:12.420 --> 01:10:13.699
But here's what we can do

01:10:14.659 --> 01:10:16.579
We can take Jehovah at his word

01:10:16.979 --> 01:10:20.579
Trusting that he will support us through difficult times

01:10:21.220 --> 01:10:25.460
Even if the difficult times are of our own making

01:10:27.989 --> 01:10:33.270
David allowed Jehovah to help him recover spiritually

01:10:34.789 --> 01:10:36.789
I'm going to repeat that

01:10:36.869 --> 01:10:43.430
David allowed Jehovah to help him recover spiritually

01:10:44.069 --> 01:10:44.869
How did he do that?

01:10:45.590 --> 01:10:52.229
Well one way was by humbly accepting the council of an experienced elder the prophet Nathan

01:10:52.869 --> 01:10:54.390
His repentance was sincere

01:10:55.109 --> 01:10:57.430
It was no it was no facade about it

01:10:58.149 --> 01:10:59.670
We know that

01:10:59.670 --> 01:11:00.869
We know that David

01:11:00.869 --> 01:11:02.869
Repented with a good attitude

01:11:02.869 --> 01:11:09.029
Because later David and Basheba even named one of their sons Nathan

01:11:09.829 --> 01:11:12.710
And you don't do that if you resent someone

01:11:13.430 --> 01:11:15.989
He took the council with a good attitude

01:11:16.789 --> 01:11:18.229
David

01:11:18.229 --> 01:11:22.550
Learned from his mistakes and he kept on doing what was good

01:11:23.350 --> 01:11:28.069
Now he may have been thinking of himself when he wrote what we read at some 37

01:11:28.710 --> 01:11:30.710
23 and 24

01:11:34.229 --> 01:11:37.909
Jehovah guides the steps of a man when he finds pleasure in his way

01:11:38.949 --> 01:11:42.550
Although he may fall he will not be hurled down

01:11:43.350 --> 01:11:47.270
For Jehovah supports him by the hand

01:11:47.270 --> 01:11:51.029
And David felt that support on many occasions

01:11:52.149 --> 01:11:54.229
Well how can we learn from David's example

01:11:55.270 --> 01:11:56.710
If we sin

01:11:56.710 --> 01:11:59.510
We have to let Jehovah help us recover

01:12:00.149 --> 01:12:03.750
And more often than not he'll use the elders for that purpose

01:12:05.750 --> 01:12:09.590
What about true faithful parents whose child has gone astray

01:12:10.550 --> 01:12:13.590
David would understand your sorrow

01:12:14.550 --> 01:12:19.989
The sleepless nights the tears the heartache the worry

01:12:21.430 --> 01:12:25.989
One of his own sons Amnon raped his daughter Tamar

01:12:26.869 --> 01:12:31.909
Another of his sons Absalom killed Amnon and then fled the country for three years

01:12:32.869 --> 01:12:37.029
Finally the Bible says David longed to go to Absalom

01:12:37.590 --> 01:12:41.670
For he had become reconciled to the death of Amnon

01:12:42.710 --> 01:12:44.710
So he called him back

01:12:44.710 --> 01:12:50.550
You might say in effect that Absalom got a three-year time out for murder

01:12:51.829 --> 01:12:53.350
Did he appreciate the mercy?

01:12:54.310 --> 01:12:56.310
No, he did not

01:12:56.310 --> 01:13:01.270
He tried to take the throne from David conspired against his own father

01:13:02.390 --> 01:13:04.069
And you'll wonder

01:13:04.069 --> 01:13:05.750
What was he thinking

01:13:05.750 --> 01:13:08.229
Because at the time he was plotting against David

01:13:09.029 --> 01:13:15.189
He must have known that Jehovah had declared that it was Solomon who was going to succeed his father and not Absalom

01:13:15.189 --> 01:13:20.069
He must have known that did he really think that he could frustrate Jehovah's purpose

01:13:22.149 --> 01:13:24.310
We could Absalom was finally put to death

01:13:25.350 --> 01:13:27.989
And David was devastated

01:13:28.869 --> 01:13:30.869
The poor young man

01:13:31.670 --> 01:13:37.109
It seems he had a weak spot for his wicked sons

01:13:38.630 --> 01:13:42.710
You know when we think of permissive parents we often think of high priest Eli

01:13:43.430 --> 01:13:45.430
And his sons Hoffnay and Phineas

01:13:46.069 --> 01:13:49.109
But when you think about it David was a bit permissive himself

01:13:50.229 --> 01:13:54.310
And you wonder if Solomon wasn't thinking of his own half brothers

01:13:54.869 --> 01:13:57.350
When he encouraged parents to use the rod

01:14:01.060 --> 01:14:07.539
Now David couldn't force his wicked sons to respect Jehovah's standards

01:14:08.260 --> 01:14:09.779
But there was something he could do

01:14:10.739 --> 01:14:13.939
He had a faithful son at home Solomon

01:14:14.579 --> 01:14:23.220
And so David and Bathsheba could lavish Solomon with the love and affection that he deserved and also help him to grow spiritually

01:14:24.020 --> 01:14:29.300
And they obviously did because at Proverbs 4 and verse 3 we read these are Solomon's words

01:14:29.939 --> 01:14:32.659
I was a true son to my father

01:14:33.619 --> 01:14:38.100
And the one especially loved by my mother and then he added

01:14:38.819 --> 01:14:40.340
He taught me

01:14:41.140 --> 01:14:45.539
So David obviously was teaching his son to grow spiritually

01:14:46.739 --> 01:14:48.899
Now it doesn't always happen that way

01:14:50.020 --> 01:14:52.659
Consider this true to life scenario

01:14:53.939 --> 01:14:56.340
A brother and sister have two sons

01:14:57.140 --> 01:15:00.260
One leaves the truth and the other remains faithful

01:15:01.539 --> 01:15:03.859
The parents are heartbroken

01:15:04.579 --> 01:15:08.020
And like David they go into mourning for their son

01:15:09.140 --> 01:15:11.539
And that's completely understandable

01:15:12.579 --> 01:15:13.779
But we have to ask

01:15:14.659 --> 01:15:18.100
What about the son at home who has remained faithful

01:15:18.659 --> 01:15:22.180
What about the son who has never given his parents a moment's grief

01:15:22.899 --> 01:15:27.619
Will he continue to get the love and affection that he so richly deserves

01:15:28.340 --> 01:15:30.899
Or will it be all about his brother

01:15:33.539 --> 01:15:38.260
Many of our modern day fellow believers have demonstrated their trust in Jehovah

01:15:39.779 --> 01:15:43.859
One brother who remained faithful till his death in 2015 said this

01:15:45.140 --> 01:15:47.380
Life is unpredictable at times

01:15:47.939 --> 01:15:50.659
Uncertain and even hard to deal with

01:15:51.619 --> 01:15:56.340
But Jehovah blesses those who lean on him and his advice

01:15:57.460 --> 01:16:03.859
Pray to be as productive and as active in Jehovah's service as you can be

01:16:04.819 --> 01:16:07.939
And notice this focus on what you can do

01:16:08.819 --> 01:16:11.220
Not or what you cannot do

01:16:12.819 --> 01:16:16.340
That excellent advice is being followed by traveling overseers

01:16:16.819 --> 01:16:19.699
Who are transitioning into other forms of service

01:16:20.500 --> 01:16:24.659
It's also being applied by long-time members of the Bethel family

01:16:24.659 --> 01:16:28.020
Who are no longer serving as department overseers

01:16:28.659 --> 01:16:34.020
They are grateful to Jehovah for what they can do and they focus on that

01:16:35.779 --> 01:16:39.859
As this system of things that de-generates from bad to worse

01:16:40.819 --> 01:16:42.979
We can expect difficult times

01:16:43.939 --> 01:16:49.779
When that coalition of nations known as Gog of May Gog launches its final attack on God's people

01:16:50.500 --> 01:16:52.979
It will seem that there is no way out

01:16:54.020 --> 01:16:58.180
Our most formidable weapon at that time will be our faith

01:16:58.979 --> 01:17:00.979
And so brothers it's fitting

01:17:01.699 --> 01:17:06.819
That our year text for 2017 should be

01:17:08.420 --> 01:17:09.619
Some

01:17:09.619 --> 01:17:10.819
37

01:17:10.819 --> 01:17:12.819
Verse 3

01:17:12.819 --> 01:17:18.340
Trust in Jehovah and do what is good

01:17:35.460 --> 01:17:39.699
Thank you very much brother explain. We'll remember that talk at least until the end of next year

01:17:43.979 --> 01:17:46.939
Your talk was well spoken as usual
