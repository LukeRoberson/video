00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:08.839
Zechariah 8 verse 23 highlights the unification of true worshipers during the time of the

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:10.839
end.

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:18.039
How does Jehovah feel about this unity between the anointed remnant and the great crowd?

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:22.760
How do our anointed brothers feel about this relationship?

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:30.000
How important is it that Jehovah has used the anointed servants of his as a magnet to draw

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.119
people to him?

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.039
And why has he done this?

00:00:35.039 --> 00:00:40.479
To answer those questions, let's open our Bibles to Isaiah chapter 60.

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:49.640
Isaiah chapter 60 will help us understand the answers to these questions.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.880
Isaiah 60, let's begin.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:01:01.880
Verse 1, arise, O woman, arise, O woman, shed light for your light has come.

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:07.280
The glory of Jehovah shines on you.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:14.159
In the modern day fulfillment, the heavenly woman is represented on earth by the anointed

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.400
remnant.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.760
What's their role?

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:24.959
Well, Jehovah says, the glory of Jehovah shines on you.

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:29.879
What a unique responsibility and privilege Jehovah is using the anointed remnant as a source

00:01:29.879 --> 00:01:32.879
of enlightenment.

00:01:32.879 --> 00:01:38.840
And since the pivotal year of 1919, think deeply about what Jehovah is accomplishing by

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.640
means of spiritual Israel.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:41.799
What has he been doing?

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:46.079
Well, let's read verse 3.

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:54.079
Nations will go to your light and kings to your shining splendor and come the nations,

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:58.030
the nations did come.

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:04.510
Think about individuals all over the planet that have been attracted to the truth.

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.870
They've been attracted to the truth because the anointed remnant has helped them to understand

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:14.349
the issues such as and doctrine such as the Messianic Kingdom, the issue of sovereignty,

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:16.830
the ransom, God's name.

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.349
All over the planet, nations come and are attracted to the truth.

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:27.389
To this day, we have some 8 million servants of Jehovah's living proof, but 8 million servants

00:02:27.389 --> 00:02:31.389
of Jehovah, that's not just that's not all.

00:02:31.389 --> 00:02:36.669
What about all of those that have died as baptized witnesses during the last days?

00:02:36.669 --> 00:02:43.189
Tens of thousands of lovers of Jehovah, add that to the math of the 8 million.

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:48.110
And it's not just 8 million people that are standing around, bringing in their old personalities

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:49.710
into the truth.

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:55.430
Think about the changes people have made, exercising a love and the fruitage of the Spirit, putting

00:02:55.509 --> 00:03:01.150
on the new personality, understanding Jehovah, gaining knowledge, faith, dedication,

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:02.909
baptism.

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:07.710
This is something that Jehovah has helped all of us to do.

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:09.389
And these are facts.

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:15.830
This is concrete evidence, evidence, facts, not something in our imagination that represents

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:20.270
lovers of God who declared, I am on Jehovah's side.

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:23.270
I want to go with the spiritual Jew.

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:26.280
Where is that role?

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:33.120
But how do the anointed feel about this relationship, this precious relationship with the great crowd?

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.710
Well, let's read verse 5.

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:46.189
At that time, you, the anointed, will see and become radiant, and your heart will throb

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:47.189
and overflow.

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:48.550
They get excited.

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:50.550
Why?

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:54.150
Because of the wealth of the sea will be directed to you.

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.349
The resources of the nations will come to you.

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:00.150
Think about that.

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.990
People coming out of the sea of mankind in order to worship and association with the anointed,

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:06.990
they are anointed brothers.

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:11.750
The hearts of the anointed brothers, the royal priesthood throb and get excited because

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:12.990
of what they see.

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:15.150
What do they witness?

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:21.629
They witness the educational work that they are promoting, having fruitage, having results.

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:28.199
They see that their labor is real and their hearts throb.

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:31.879
How does Jehovah feel about this relationship?

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:36.920
Well, let's read verse 7.

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:43.500
And the flocks of Kedar will be gathered to you.

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.060
The rams of Nibbayoth will serve you.

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:51.180
Now these animals represent sacrifices, of course, that would be put on an altar.

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:56.939
And then they will come on my altar, that's Jehovah's altar, with approval.

00:04:56.939 --> 00:05:01.220
And I will beautify my glorious house.

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.220
Think about that.

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:06.779
Think about all of the sacrifices that the great crowd are making.

00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:11.339
And they're putting on Jehovah's altar, Jehovah's altar, and he accepts that.

00:05:11.339 --> 00:05:13.259
He loves that.

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:16.779
The sacrifice is the great crowd makes to praise Jehovah God.

00:05:16.779 --> 00:05:22.939
They devote their time, a sacrifice, their energy, their skills to promote pure worship.

00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:29.439
They put their personal desires in a secondary position so that they can put forward the

00:05:29.439 --> 00:05:32.680
interest of God's kingdom.

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.639
And there's zeal for true worship.

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:37.120
What does it do according to verse 7?

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:40.519
It says it beautifies Jehovah's house.

00:05:40.519 --> 00:05:46.120
It beautifies the great spiritual temple that Jehovah's using today.

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:54.860
Certainly, the sacrifices that we are making here at Bethel meet with Jehovah's approval.

00:05:54.860 --> 00:06:01.420
We know that because we witness him blessing, blessing our efforts, our work, and answering

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:03.459
our specific prayers.

00:06:03.459 --> 00:06:08.300
What a privilege we have to have Jehovah's approval is the most precious thing in life.

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:14.819
And here we are a part of this prophecy experiencing this personally.

00:06:14.819 --> 00:06:19.220
However, not everyone feels this way.

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:25.300
Not everyone is rejoicing and their hearts are throbbing and we're gaining their acceptance

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.019
in approval, no.

00:06:28.019 --> 00:06:31.779
And now we want to go to verse 14.

00:06:31.779 --> 00:06:35.899
And really think about verse 14, what is involved?

00:06:35.899 --> 00:06:39.139
What is Jehovah doing?

00:06:39.139 --> 00:06:42.899
Verse 14, let's see the big picture.

00:06:42.899 --> 00:06:50.019
The sons of those who oppressed you, they're not rejoicing, there's oppression.

00:06:50.019 --> 00:06:51.740
They'll bow down before you.

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:57.699
All those treating you disrespectfully must bow down at your feet.

00:06:57.699 --> 00:07:05.379
So there's going to be individuals that disrespect and oppose the anointed, they'll press them.

00:07:05.379 --> 00:07:07.980
But why?

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:14.139
Think about what Jehovah's creating by means of his royal priesthood.

00:07:14.139 --> 00:07:20.180
As they fulfill their primary obligation to preach the good news of the kingdom earthwide

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:26.459
for a witness to all the nations, the nations, Jehovah's putting his anointed servants on

00:07:26.459 --> 00:07:30.060
the world stage for all to see.

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:37.860
And by means of them, by means of them, Jehovah's giving people an opportunity to argue, argue

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:40.420
in a universal court case.

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:49.139
The most crucial case ever to be argued, whether to accept or reject Jehovah's rulership.

00:07:49.139 --> 00:07:56.100
To examine the facts of the case, concentration camps, bans, vicious persecution, unjust

00:07:56.100 --> 00:08:01.819
imprisonments, death sentences, cannot snuff out true worship.

00:08:01.819 --> 00:08:07.420
To the contrary, the ten men, they still hold on to the robe of a Jew, they're not going

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:09.019
to let that robe go.

00:08:09.019 --> 00:08:10.740
Why?

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:15.819
Because they don't view themselves as innocent victims of oppressive men.

00:08:15.819 --> 00:08:21.500
They stand for the truth, and they know the truth is linked to the loftier understanding

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:24.939
of Jehovah's universal sovereignty.

00:08:24.939 --> 00:08:32.659
This understanding makes them strong under extreme circumstances, such as we read about

00:08:32.659 --> 00:08:33.779
on our website.

00:08:33.779 --> 00:08:41.220
But let's go back to verse 14, because it says there that these oppressive individuals

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:47.100
and those who treat the anointed disrespectfully will bow down at the feet.

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:49.860
They'll bow down in respect now.

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:50.860
Has that happened?

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:51.860
Yes.

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:58.179
Some opposes bow down in respect as they acknowledge the superior way of life that God's blessing

00:08:58.179 --> 00:09:00.820
brings to His people.

00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:06.580
In Tanzania during a time of persecution, one prison guard put it this way, in Malawi,

00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:11.740
they wasted their efforts, persecuting and killing these people, likewise here, they

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:17.340
will never compromise, they just increase.

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:23.899
In Tajikistan, one prison official said recently about brother Nadoff, I admire his conduct,

00:09:23.899 --> 00:09:31.299
firmness, courage and fortitude due to, and due to our uncompromising stand, this is the

00:09:31.299 --> 00:09:36.299
type of comments we get from some opposes, albeit unwillingly, but they're compelled to

00:09:36.299 --> 00:09:39.059
acknowledge what we do.

00:09:39.059 --> 00:09:47.259
Assampling of why Jehovah is so proud of the spiritual Jew and of the ten men.

00:09:47.259 --> 00:09:57.750
Thus verse 20, Jehovah says, No more will your sun set, nor will your moon wane, for

00:09:57.750 --> 00:10:03.269
Jehovah will become for you an eternal light, an eternal light.

00:10:03.269 --> 00:10:09.389
And for more than 100 years, spiritual Israel has been enjoying Jehovah's favor and the

00:10:09.389 --> 00:10:13.789
light continues to shine on them, and it will not stop.

00:10:13.789 --> 00:10:19.909
Our God will become, what does it say, an eternal light, the sun won't set, the moon won't

00:10:19.909 --> 00:10:27.149
wane, no, rather, Jehovah will continue to shed light upon His loyal servants and fulfill

00:10:27.149 --> 00:10:30.470
every promise throughout eternity.

00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:33.309
And for this all of us declare, hallelujah.
