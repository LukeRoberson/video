00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:08.580
At the heart of the Middle East lie the lands where Jesus walked.

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:28.230
What were they like when he was there and what lessons do they hold for our life today?

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:37.590
The palace fortress of Herodium south of Jerusalem built by Herod the Great.

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:44.590
Like many fortresses it sits on a mountain providing great visibility all around and an

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:49.390
ideal looking spot to start our journey.

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:55.030
To place ourselves on the map we even listed the help of one of the local brothers who knows

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:00.429
how to get the best view of this land.

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:03.950
Daniel, this view is amazing.

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:05.829
What can we actually see from up here?

00:01:05.829 --> 00:01:10.390
Well this is a great spot because you can see so many famous locations from the Bible

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.030
that we've all heard about.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.590
For example we have Jerusalem just behind us, the Mount of Olives.

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.870
This is where the Gideon wilderness starts and down there you can see it from here is

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:21.629
the Dead Sea.

00:01:21.629 --> 00:01:25.230
So it really gives you an idea of the extent of the promised land.

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:29.709
But more than anything it connects us to the story of Jesus.

00:01:29.709 --> 00:01:33.950
Not just because this place is linked with Herod the Great but because from here you have

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.030
a great view of Bethlehem right there over the hill.

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:43.829
While the birthplace of Jesus that's an amazing thing to see.

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.750
Do you know what strikes me looking at the terrain?

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.629
Is it so hilly?

00:01:49.629 --> 00:01:52.469
People must have spent their lives just going up and down hills.

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:54.310
Yes for sure just think about it.

00:01:54.310 --> 00:02:00.069
We are 750 meters above sea level and Bethlehem is just a little bit higher than us but the

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:05.909
Dead Sea that is so close is minus 400 meters is the lowest place on earth.

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.270
So when the Bible says that they went down to a place that they went up to a place it's

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.150
something very literal.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:17.349
So it's not up in terms of north on a map it's up in terms of sea level.

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:29.259
Yes and it's a very important lesson we can learn from the geography of this place.

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:34.259
From the Dead Sea in the south close to where our journey has begun to the peak of Mount

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:41.539
Hermann in the north the elevation changes by over 3,000 meters.

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:48.840
The further you travel here the more hills and mountains you have to climb.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:54.479
To understand the long Arduous Germany Jesus family would have taken to Jerusalem for

00:02:54.479 --> 00:03:00.919
the annual festivals Daniel has brought me to another looking point near Nazareth.

00:03:00.919 --> 00:03:06.960
Yes there were two main routes leading up towards Jerusalem both of them passing right through

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:08.759
here this very valley.

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:15.000
So just imagine them from Nazareth just behind us going down into the valley then slowly

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.120
trekking up about 600 meters in elevation through Samaria before eventually reaching

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.830
Jerusalem.

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:27.110
From what I've seen today I can't imagine that was an easy journey.

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:33.710
No not at all it doesn't stay nice and flat like this for long.

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:39.629
Understanding this land gives more meaning to the journeys described in the Bible.

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:46.990
The Joseph and the heavily pregnant Mary humbly and obediently traveled up to Bethlehem.

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:54.069
Later they made it their families custom to go from year to year up to Jerusalem.

00:03:54.069 --> 00:04:00.270
Mary and Joseph overcame physical obstacles to share and true worship at the temple.

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:04.110
But we don't have to come here to walk in their footsteps.

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:09.789
We can do that in a sense by climbing our own hills and mountains for Jehovah by overcoming

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:38.939
whatever obstacles we encounter in order not to forsake our meeting together.

00:04:38.939 --> 00:04:43.779
The donkey is sometimes viewed as a lowly animal but throughout the history of the Israelite

00:04:43.779 --> 00:04:47.139
people it was a part of daily life.

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:48.620
Why?

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:53.620
Their sharp hooves make it more sure footed than a horse which meant it was better suited

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:58.899
to the steep slopes and rough mountainous terrain all around.

00:04:58.899 --> 00:05:04.300
The long years that donkeys are famous for help to expel its internal heat quickly allowing

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:08.699
it to stay cool in hot environments.

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:14.259
These have great memories too enabling them to remember roots and people.

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:24.029
There's far more to this lowly beast of burden than meets the eye.

00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:28.709
Next we are searching for signs of another animal.

00:05:28.709 --> 00:05:47.829
One which helps us understand that to Jehovah there is more to us than meets the eye.

00:05:47.829 --> 00:05:55.990
This is a very well preserved columnbarium or better known as a dovecote.

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:57.990
And types have been found around Israel.

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:03.670
This one is a series of manmade hollows carved into the limestone.

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:08.949
A pair of doves were housed in each one they were bred here.

00:06:08.949 --> 00:06:14.629
And judging by the amount of holes raising doves was quite an industry.

00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:22.069
Why were doves in such high demand while they provided meat the don was harvested as fertiliser

00:06:22.069 --> 00:06:25.910
but there was also another use.

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:31.029
After the birth of a child a dove could be used as a sin offering and a second one as

00:06:31.029 --> 00:06:36.709
the burnt offering by parents who could not afford a young ram.

00:06:36.709 --> 00:06:42.750
No wonder then the closer we get to Jerusalem and the temple area the more ancient doves

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:45.870
coats have been excavated.

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:51.069
Directly beside the temple mount itself a first century fragment was found bearing the

00:06:51.069 --> 00:06:57.069
word sacrifice next to an image of two birds.

00:06:57.069 --> 00:07:03.750
Coins, merchants' weights and even these shops from Jesus era have also been excavated

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:06.790
beside the temple mount.

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:12.589
These finds led to the conclusion that these were the very streets where worshippers even

00:07:12.589 --> 00:07:19.509
poor ones could buy animals to offer as sacrifices to Jehovah.

00:07:19.509 --> 00:07:25.110
This provision teaches us that Jehovah loves each one of us and that he accepts our

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:29.149
best even if we feel it's insignificant.

00:07:29.149 --> 00:07:33.350
Our circumstances do not define our worth to him.

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:41.149
Jehovah values our whole soul service even if it's limited by age, health or other circumstances.

00:07:41.149 --> 00:08:00.579
As the scripture says man sees what appears to the eyes but Jehovah sees into the heart.

00:08:00.579 --> 00:08:06.899
Something together as a family was important in Jesus' day and something found on practically

00:08:06.899 --> 00:08:10.819
every table was bread.

00:08:10.819 --> 00:08:18.019
In fact it's been estimated that 50-70% of the diet in Jesus' day was made up of bread.

00:08:18.019 --> 00:08:23.899
No wonder the Hebrew and Greek expressions for eat a meal in the Bible literally mean

00:08:23.899 --> 00:08:24.899
eat bread.

00:08:24.899 --> 00:08:39.049
Of course before you could eat it you had to make it and while it only needed a few

00:08:39.049 --> 00:08:43.210
simple ingredients this was no easy to ask.

00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:49.210
To make the flower the women of the house would need to grind the wheat or barley or other

00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:55.809
grains using a mill depending on the type of mill and how many were milling.

00:08:55.809 --> 00:09:01.649
It could take hours before you had enough flour to feed a family.

00:09:01.649 --> 00:09:12.509
After that the flour might be sieved to remove bits of stone from the mill and top of all

00:09:12.509 --> 00:09:21.710
that water had to be drawn up from the nearest well or system.

00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:27.629
This one is roughly six meters deep but the one believed to be Jacob's well was found

00:09:27.629 --> 00:09:31.990
to be at least 23 meters deep.

00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:35.590
You can see the grooves here, one in this old stone.

00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:43.629
It's been worn down over the years by the rope pulling against it time after time.

00:09:43.629 --> 00:09:47.750
Imagine by the time a few buckets of jars were drawn you might begin to feel a little

00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:58.639
worn down too tired and ready to eat.

00:09:58.639 --> 00:10:08.419
I'm popping in to see some of my new friends and I've been promised some bread.

00:10:08.419 --> 00:10:15.059
Sister Jamila grew up milling her flower by hand too just like in Jesus' day providing

00:10:15.059 --> 00:10:21.620
for our family's basic needs can take time and energy but by coming together at meal

00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:29.659
times families can be refreshed physically and spiritually.

00:10:29.659 --> 00:10:34.700
Breaking bread together draws us closer to each other and to Jehovah.

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:40.659
That's another simple recipe that will always stand the test of time.

00:10:40.659 --> 00:10:46.659
Maybe in Joseph's life wasn't luxurious but their family still enjoyed rich moments

00:10:46.659 --> 00:10:47.659
every day.

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:53.340
They put more importance on the atmosphere at the table than the food that was on it.

00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:55.179
And so should we.

00:10:55.179 --> 00:11:01.340
As we learn from the proverb, better than a fat and bull whether it's hatred is a dish of

00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:29.960
vegetables, whether it's love.

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:33.480
The modern city of Nazareth.

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:40.919
To go back in time here we need to explore beneath the surface but what we find is worth

00:11:40.919 --> 00:11:43.000
it.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:48.200
These are the remains of a Jewish house dated to the first century.

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:50.919
Very few have been found.

00:11:50.919 --> 00:11:56.279
This site gives a glimpse into the Nazareth that young Jesus knew.

00:11:56.279 --> 00:12:02.480
Somewhere in the streets near here, he and his siblings laughed and played.

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:10.269
But when they went back to their home, what was it like?

00:12:10.269 --> 00:12:14.149
Small houses consisted of just one or two rooms.

00:12:14.149 --> 00:12:19.669
The walls were made of either stones or mud bricks and they could be coated in plaster.

00:12:19.669 --> 00:12:26.909
Tree trunks supported the roof which was made from reeds or branches and then plastered.

00:12:26.909 --> 00:12:31.750
This created the main living space which was in use constantly.

00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:36.590
Here the women and girls shared in doing such tasks as spinning, weaving and preparing

00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:37.750
food.

00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:41.070
It was also where the family ate together.

00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:48.950
In at night, the whole family slept side by side on mats rolled out on the floor.

00:12:48.950 --> 00:12:53.590
In a two-story home, they would sleep on the second floor.

00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:59.070
Tradesmen like Joseph often had open fronted workshops beside their house.

00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:02.789
The roof was accessed by a ladder or stairs.

00:13:02.789 --> 00:13:12.710
Depending on the season, they used it to eat together, relax together and worship together.

00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:17.870
The requirement in Jehovah's Law that a parapet or small wall be built all around

00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:24.629
rooftop kept everyone in the family safe from falling while they used this much-needed

00:13:24.629 --> 00:13:31.080
extra living space.

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:36.200
Life was simple and it's likely Mary and Joseph lived in a humble home.

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:42.080
But Jehovah chose them not for their material wealth but for their spiritual qualities.

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:49.879
The atmosphere of love, happiness and peace within those walls had real value.

00:13:49.879 --> 00:13:58.600
It was a place where the entire family could live, learn, work and worship together.

00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:05.840
A place where everyone felt safe, not just physically, but spiritually, morally and

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:10.629
emotionally too.

00:14:10.629 --> 00:14:16.990
While we don't know where in Nazareth, Mary and Joseph lived, we do know they loved God

00:14:16.990 --> 00:14:22.309
and spoke about him and his laws when they sat in their house.

00:14:22.309 --> 00:14:50.860
By doing the same, we too can help our children thrive and turn any house into a loving home.

00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:59.139
The step straight, buried beneath Jerusalem for almost 2,000 years.

00:14:59.139 --> 00:15:05.340
During the great festivals, thousands of worshipers flocked to Jerusalem, walking together

00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:12.059
on these very steps as they made their way up to the temple, the city's beating heart.

00:15:12.059 --> 00:15:18.860
For centuries, those festivals promoted unity and love amongst it is realise.

00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:28.759
But did those things exist in the group the young Jesus and his family travelled with?

00:15:28.759 --> 00:15:38.960
To find out, let's consider what happened on another part of the journey, the way back home.

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:47.580
To help understand that journey, we even listed the help of Daniel.

00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:52.980
He's taking us to see one of the potential routes that Jesus and his family could have

00:15:52.980 --> 00:16:01.409
used to return to Nazareth, the one that crossed through the Judean wilderness.

00:16:01.450 --> 00:16:06.929
This location is fantastic because it really gives you a sense of that first leg of the journey.

00:16:06.929 --> 00:16:11.809
Over there in the distance is the Mount of Olives, so Jerusalem is just behind it.

00:16:11.809 --> 00:16:14.210
And right here is Jericho.

00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:18.929
The ancient route connecting the two was more than 20 km long.

00:16:18.929 --> 00:16:24.090
So if they had taken this route, it might have been somewhere near here that they stopped

00:16:24.090 --> 00:16:25.090
for the night.

00:16:25.090 --> 00:16:30.289
Yes, and in any case, whatever route they took, you can be sure that after a day's journey,

00:16:30.289 --> 00:16:32.289
they would have covered a huge distance.

00:16:32.289 --> 00:16:37.460
Don't doubt that.

00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:43.059
Seeing the type of distance Mary and Joseph would have travelled, before even noticing that

00:16:43.059 --> 00:16:53.379
their son was missing, adds to our understanding of what the Bible tells us.

00:16:53.379 --> 00:16:59.220
Throughout that long journey, they had assumed he was with the group or close community of

00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:03.019
relatives and friends that they had travelled with.

00:17:03.059 --> 00:17:11.950
All of this testifies to the unity and love that existed amongst these dedicated people.

00:17:11.950 --> 00:17:19.829
Today, love for Jehovah and his word form the foundation of our Christian community.

00:17:19.829 --> 00:17:27.029
Regardless of who we are or where we are from, we are members belonging to one another.

00:17:27.029 --> 00:17:30.950
As we journey through life, we rejoice together.

00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:34.549
And sadly, at times, we weep together.

00:17:34.589 --> 00:17:38.789
But either way, we are together.

00:17:38.789 --> 00:17:42.109
Perhaps that's the lesson we need to remember.

00:17:42.109 --> 00:18:00.660
Mary and Joseph didn't have to walk alone, and neither do we.

00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:02.859
Tell Jericho.

00:18:02.859 --> 00:18:09.660
A tell is a mound created by the remains of past cities and civilizations.

00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:13.140
Each one has its own story to tell.

00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:18.619
But family heads also told those stories as they taught their children about Jehovah.

00:18:18.619 --> 00:18:24.099
I can imagine that as families walked on the road passing by this place, the kids loved

00:18:24.099 --> 00:18:39.329
to hear the one about the walls of Jericho and how Jehovah made them fall.

00:18:39.329 --> 00:18:43.769
The scriptures were at the heart of education in ancient Israel.

00:18:43.769 --> 00:18:48.970
It started in the home and was built upon in the synagogue.

00:18:48.970 --> 00:18:55.930
The aim of the education prescribed by Jehovah wasn't to ensure a high social standing,

00:18:55.930 --> 00:18:59.210
but a high standing with him.

00:18:59.210 --> 00:19:03.930
Of course, parents also taught their children skills for daily life.

00:19:03.930 --> 00:19:09.210
The father took time to teach the family trade to the boys, while the mother taught household

00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:13.009
skills to the girls.

00:19:13.009 --> 00:19:19.849
But there was one fundamental facet of education that could help a child in all areas of life,

00:19:19.849 --> 00:19:23.410
learning to read and write.

00:19:23.410 --> 00:19:30.450
And we are heading to the Israelite ruins at Tell Geyser to learn more.

00:19:30.450 --> 00:19:36.210
Around 100 years ago, amongst the ruffle, a limestone tablet was found, no bigger than

00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:38.529
this replica here.

00:19:38.529 --> 00:19:45.329
Dated to the 10th century BCE, this became known as the Geyser Calendar.

00:19:45.329 --> 00:19:50.690
It contained a simple list of the seasons, leading archaeologists to conclude that it was

00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:56.730
written by the hands of a youth that it was once a schoolboy's exercise.

00:19:56.730 --> 00:20:00.569
When pottery broke, the shards were often used to write on.

00:20:00.569 --> 00:20:07.529
This one shows rows of Hebrew letters, likely from a pupil's writing exercise.

00:20:07.529 --> 00:20:10.690
People also wrote on wax-covered tablets.

00:20:10.690 --> 00:20:15.410
When a mistake was made, the wax could easily be smoothed over and erased, so a student

00:20:15.410 --> 00:20:18.450
could start again.

00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:23.210
All these findings harmonize with what we see in the Bible, reading and writing were

00:20:23.210 --> 00:20:29.450
common among God's people, even well before Jesus' time.

00:20:29.450 --> 00:20:34.250
Living in such a culture, Jesus too learned to read and write.

00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:40.410
This gave him the ability to study God's Word, which deepened his knowledge and love for

00:20:40.410 --> 00:20:42.660
Jehovah.

00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:46.140
Thousands of years later, it's the very same.

00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:51.099
In order to draw close to God, our children need to study his Word and help others

00:20:51.099 --> 00:20:52.740
do the same.

00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:59.299
To do that, they need to be able to speak, read and write as well as they can.

00:20:59.299 --> 00:21:04.619
Secular schools teach these skills, but if our young ones develop and polish them in

00:21:04.619 --> 00:21:11.259
the congregation, just like Jesus, they will go on progressing in wisdom and in favor

00:21:11.259 --> 00:21:27.500
with God and men.

00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:30.420
The Sea of Galilee.

00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:36.400
When the Western Shore lie the first century ruins of Magdala, including a synagogue

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:46.480
from Jesus' day, one of only a few uncovered to date, synagogues were built as one inscription

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:52.599
put it for the reading of the law and for teaching the commandments.

00:21:52.599 --> 00:21:58.269
So what do they like inside?

00:21:58.269 --> 00:22:04.109
A synagogue consisted of a main assembly hall, with stepped benches lining the walls where

00:22:04.109 --> 00:22:16.490
the men and women who met together sat, a chest for keeping the sacred scriptures safe,

00:22:16.490 --> 00:22:24.140
then a central space where a speaker or reader could stand next to a lector.

00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:29.059
These buildings were designed so that all in the community could come to listen and learn

00:22:29.059 --> 00:22:32.539
about their God, Jehovah.

00:22:32.539 --> 00:22:34.700
Mary was one who did that.

00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:40.579
By truly listening and meditating on what she heard, she developed a close relationship

00:22:40.579 --> 00:22:41.940
with Jehovah.

00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:50.069
This allowed her to trust in his ability to do what sounded impossible.

00:22:50.069 --> 00:22:55.829
Meanwhile, in Jerusalem, others worshipped at the temple.

00:22:55.829 --> 00:23:00.829
We could be forgiven for thinking of just one building when we hear the word temple, but

00:23:00.829 --> 00:23:10.529
that word encompassed a vast complex, which was sat here upon Mount Mariah.

00:23:10.529 --> 00:23:16.890
Mary speaks of hered the great, doubling the size of the temple area.

00:23:16.890 --> 00:23:23.009
Surrounded by colonnades, there were several open areas or courts, each one leading closer

00:23:23.009 --> 00:23:27.799
to the temple itself.

00:23:27.799 --> 00:23:34.519
This plaza still has the capacity to hold hundreds of thousands of people today, and much

00:23:34.519 --> 00:23:40.559
of the original retaining walls underneath it all are still in place.

00:23:40.559 --> 00:23:43.799
Let's get a sense of scale.

00:23:43.799 --> 00:23:52.160
One stone further along this wall is estimated to be almost 14 meters long, 4 meters deep,

00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:54.200
and 4 meters high.

00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:59.759
All of that is estimated to come close to 600 tons.

00:23:59.759 --> 00:24:05.869
The temple area is colossal.

00:24:05.869 --> 00:24:12.630
An aged and fasting widow may have felt small or even invisible in this place.

00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:19.589
Yet despite the sad spiritual state which prevailed, Anna came day by day with fastings

00:24:19.589 --> 00:24:21.950
and supplications.

00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:30.000
Jehovah not only saw her, but he blessed her for her devotion.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:36.200
Some 70 years later, after the destruction caused by the Roman army, you could have looked

00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:41.759
on from the Mount of Olives and seen the temple lying in rooms.

00:24:41.839 --> 00:24:50.599
The reputations of honest hearted ones like Mary and Anna remain intact even to this day.

00:24:50.599 --> 00:24:56.119
Jehovah cherished their worship because it came from the heart and he does the same for

00:24:56.119 --> 00:24:58.559
us today.

00:24:58.559 --> 00:25:05.240
Whether young or old as Hebrews 6 puts it, he does not forget your work and the love

00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:08.119
you show for his name.

00:25:08.119 --> 00:25:13.119
Maybe that's the overall lesson from everything we've seen so far in the land of Jesus.

00:25:13.119 --> 00:25:17.599
For Jehovah, it's all about the people, not the place.
