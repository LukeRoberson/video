This animation shows one possibility of what Solomon's Colonade may have looked like in the first century temple.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:27.780
Solomon's Colonade was a covered passageway, located on the east side of the temple's outer courtyard.

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:31.780
The Bible mentions this location three times by name.

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:40.320
John states that Jesus walked through this Colonade in winter time, and that a group of Jews surrounded him there,

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.320
demanding that he tell them if he was the Christ.

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:54.100
Later, an amazed crowd gathered at Solomon's Colonade to hear Peter explain how he had cured a man who was crippled from birth.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:01:10.829
And in plain view of others, the early Christians met in Solomon's Colonade.
