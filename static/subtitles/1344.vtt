00:00:05.679 --> 00:00:14.599
During the months of December 2017 and January 2018, we were thrilled to have over one hundred

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:21.600
Karenssegore-speaking campaign volunteers from Australia, Thailand and the United States join

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.269
our local Karenssegore-speaking publishers.

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.070
The current field here at Mirmire's progressed quickly, however, the majority of Karens

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.750
people here have not yet had an opportunity to hear the good news.

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:41.030
So when they see the Bible literature or video in the language, it touched their heart.

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.350
One man that we met in our ministry used to chew beetle nut, but he realized God did

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:46.869
not approve.

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:54.969
So he prayed to God for help, and he was able to quit beetle nut with God's help.

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:59.929
Serving in the Karenssegore field in Mirmire is really a dream come true for me.

00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:04.569
There are challenges and adjustments, but there's nothing compared to all the blessings

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:05.650
I've gained.

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.849
The preaching campaign was a real success.

00:01:08.849 --> 00:01:14.650
As a result, many new Bible studies started, and we have also located the areas with

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.010
the greatest potential of growth.

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.370
It is very, very exciting.

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:25.010
The clear evidence of Jehovah's spirit on the campaign arrangements has led us to

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:30.609
the conclusion that God has summoned us to declare the good news among the Karenssegore

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:31.049
people.
