00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:06.919
Jesus, Jesus.

00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:11.919
Martha, I did not expect to see you here.

00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:12.919
Where's Mary?

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:16.920
They told me that you were coming, and I just could not wait.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.920
Martha, may you have peace, and make you hope a comfort your morning heart.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.920
Martha, we are all deeply saddened of the death of your brother, our friend Lazarus.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.920
Thank you, Philip.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.920
I thank all of you.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.920
Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:47.920
Yet, even now I know that whatever you ask God for, God will give you.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.920
Your brother will rise. Lazarus will live again.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.920
I know that my brother will rise.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.920
I know that there won't be a resurrection on the last day.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.920
I am the resurrection and the life.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:08.920
The one who exercises faith in me, even though he dies, will come to life.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.920
Do you believe this?

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:11.920
Yes, Lord.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:17.920
I have believed that you are the Christ, the Son of God, the one coming into the world.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:25.230
Martha, my sister, my father in heaven will bless you for your faith.

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:27.230
Where is Mary?

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:38.159
I will get her.

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:50.140
Lord, Mary is here.

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.140
There isn't any here.

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.140
My brother would not have died.

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:17.300
Where have you laid him?

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:32.379
Lord, come and see.

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:35.379
Lazarus was dead four days.

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:40.379
His body had been carefully prepared for burial according to Jewish custom.

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:47.379
It was not embalmed as the Egyptians were, so his body had already begun to decay.

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:51.379
Still, Martha and Mary had faith in Jesus' power.

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:56.379
They knew beyond a doubt that Jesus was the Messiah.

00:02:56.379 --> 00:03:00.379
So they took Jesus to the cave where Lazarus had been laid.

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:27.139
A large stone was lying against the entrance to the cave.

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:29.139
Please be quiet.

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:32.139
Let us listen to what the Lord Jesus is about to say.

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:34.139
Take the stone away.

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:40.620
Lord, I know he must smell.

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.620
For it has been four days.

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:47.620
Did I not tell you that if you would believe you would see the glory of God?

00:03:47.620 --> 00:04:01.039
Father, I thank you that you have heard me.

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:04.039
True, I knew that you always hear me,

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:07.039
but I spoke on account of the crowd standing around,

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:13.139
so that they may believe that you sent me.

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:32.529
Lazarus, come out.

00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:36.529
Free him and let him go.
