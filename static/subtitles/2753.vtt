00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:05.360
Just as a person can be awakened from a deep sleep,

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:10.359
the Bible shows that it is possible to be awakened from death.

00:00:10.359 --> 00:00:14.359
Jesus did just that for his friend Lazarus.

00:00:14.359 --> 00:00:23.230
Lazarus had been dead for four days.

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.230
If some part of Lazarus had survived his death and gone to heaven,

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:33.229
would Jesus take him out of heaven and force him to live on earth again?

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:37.229
No, Lazarus was asleep in the grave.

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:43.229
Jesus gave him back his life and reunited him with his family.

00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:49.229
The Bible promises the time when many people will be resurrected from the dead,

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:52.229
just as Lazarus was.

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:55.229
Jesus spoke of this wonderful hope when he said,

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:58.229
the one who exercises faith in me,

00:00:58.229 --> 00:01:02.229
even though he dies, will come to life.
