00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:22.390
It's hard to believe it's been almost a decade since that first release in 2012.

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:31.989
In that time, the Become Jehovah's Friends series has proved to be a real gift from Jehovah.

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:40.429
Through these Bible lessons, children can learn to be kind, to be honest, to be respectful,

00:00:40.429 --> 00:00:49.390
and to develop other godly qualities that help them see and obey the one who is invisible.

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:58.350
How can we begin to understand the far-reaching impact this series has had on Christian families?

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.750
We're going to let Christian parents tell how these videos have helped their children

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:10.269
to become Jehovah's Friend.

00:01:10.269 --> 00:01:15.069
The Canadian had a really hard time working together with the older brothers and sisters

00:01:15.069 --> 00:01:17.069
in the congregation.

00:01:17.069 --> 00:01:29.819
I had a really hard time because they're kind of slow, but lesson 25 making friends was

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:32.700
just what I needed.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.579
We spent a few weeks discussing the videos during our family worship evening.

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:44.340
The videos helped her to be more open-minded, be more respectful to the elderly brothers

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:50.189
and sisters, and want to work with them in field service.

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:58.909
So feel like chatting with sister Elsa, even though she's so old, so I can do that too.

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:03.629
These videos strengthened my relationship with Jehovah.

00:02:03.629 --> 00:02:08.550
I know that he hasn't forgotten me as a single parent.

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:18.310
It can be so hard for single parents because they're trying to take on the role of both parents.

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:24.189
I got baptized because I loved Jehovah with my whole heart.

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:31.189
Jehovah still loves me even though I made from dust and I'm so little.

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:41.159
He took some of the weight off my shoulders.

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:48.280
Laura, our middle child, was perfectly healthy until she turned four years old.

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.479
That's when she was diagnosed with a rare tumor in her central nervous system.

00:02:53.479 --> 00:03:01.580
Unfortunately, when the treatment was over, Laura passed away.

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.900
Even while she was sick, she just loved watching the videos.

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.060
Her favorite one was let's go in service.

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.500
This video really made her want to talk about Jehovah.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:19.539
During the time that she was receiving chemotherapy treatments, which lowered her immunity,

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:24.219
we couldn't even leave the house with her.

00:03:24.219 --> 00:03:28.900
But sometimes we'd bring her to get a check-up or get an exam done.

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.219
The doctor would say that everything was fine for now that her immunity was okay, and

00:03:33.219 --> 00:03:39.620
the very first thing that she'd say to the doctor was, so I can go to the ministry, right?

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.139
The doctor would laugh and say, sure, you can.

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:48.139
Our family would take advantage of those times to go and feel service together as a family

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:55.460
all together that made Laura so happy.

00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:03.939
It does us good to remember why the become Jehovah's friend series was created.

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:12.340
These videos were not designed as mere entertainment to simply pacify children for a short period

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.379
of time.

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:21.100
These lessons were designed to help children build a relationship with Jehovah so they can

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:25.980
live and serve him forever.

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:29.699
Jehovah loves children.

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:36.220
That love was evident in how his son Jesus Christ treated children.

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:41.220
The governing body shares that love as well.

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:45.980
Also, Jehovah loves Christian parents.

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:53.930
He sees how hard you work to impress a love for God deep in your child's heart.

00:04:53.930 --> 00:05:00.329
No doubt, you look forward to sharing every new video with your child to help them learn

00:05:00.329 --> 00:05:07.449
to love and respect Jehovah, Jesus, and God's Word.

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:12.569
But more important, how do you think Jehovah feels?

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:18.689
Knowing that a young child can come to know him through this animated series and grow

00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:23.649
up to become his dedicated servant?

00:05:23.649 --> 00:05:28.930
That is truly special.

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:35.689
We will continue to pray that this series reaches the hearts of our young ones and draws

00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:41.009
them closer to Jehovah, their friend now and forever.
