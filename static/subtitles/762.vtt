00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:07.940
which has greater appeal, an effective counselor or loving shepherd.

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:14.939
If you're to be effective brothers and sisters in strengthening the organization and building up the brotherhood,

00:00:14.939 --> 00:00:21.940
it's a good subject to consider and it includes you sisters too.

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:27.940
A counselor can be defined as one who gives advice. Now the world has a lot of counselors.

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:35.939
They've got marriage counselors and financial counselors and bereavement counselors and all kinds of counselors.

00:00:35.939 --> 00:00:42.939
And you'll find that their counsel varies according to their experience in education.

00:00:42.939 --> 00:00:47.939
A hit the fell is a biblical example of a counselor.

00:00:47.939 --> 00:00:53.939
And the Bible says what he advised was considered as the word of the true God.

00:00:54.939 --> 00:01:09.670
Today, a person might feel that he is a good counselor and he may freely offer advice, some of which may or may not be accepted.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:21.099
Maybe a solution oriented husband counsels his emotionally distraught wife to just quit worry.

00:01:21.099 --> 00:01:31.099
Or well versed elder quickly reads a Bible text and he advises an extreme and anxiety filled publisher to just get over it.

00:01:31.099 --> 00:01:35.099
How effective is such counsel?

00:01:35.099 --> 00:01:43.739
There's a saying people don't care how much you know until they know how much you care.

00:01:43.739 --> 00:01:48.739
Counsel is more effective when the counselor is also a shepherd.

00:01:48.739 --> 00:01:56.739
A shepherd is one who comforts nourishes listens and does not ignore the emotional needs of the distraught one.

00:01:56.739 --> 00:02:01.739
Jehovah gives counsel or advice, but he always does more.

00:02:01.739 --> 00:02:05.739
You see, he also shepherds.

00:02:05.739 --> 00:02:13.740
When he counsels, he tends to the person's emotional needs and he provides a needed follow-up.

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:21.740
Consider how he dealt with an emotionally depressed prophet by the name of Elijah.

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:31.740
I'm turning to First Kings 19 and we're going to consider just briefly the interaction he had with Elijah.

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:38.740
And you will recall that he was driven by fear. Elijah was driven by fear of Jezebel.

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:43.740
Elijah fled southward for 95 miles to Bersheba.

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:49.740
And then he walked for about another 200 miles to Mount Hora.

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:58.740
But now notice in verse 5 it says then he that is Elijah lay down and fell asleep under the broom tree.

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:04.740
But suddenly an angel touched him and said to him, get up and eat.

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:11.740
When he looked, there his head was around loaf on heated stones and a jug of water.

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:14.740
He ate and drank and laid down again.

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:21.740
Later the angel of Jehovah came back a second time and touched him and said, get up and eat.

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.740
For the journey will be too much for you.

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:30.740
So he got up and ate a drink and knew the strength of that nourishment.

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:41.419
He went on for 40 days and 40 nights until he reached Hora, the mountain of the true God.

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:54.860
You notice the angel awakened Elijah, ministered to him and Elijah went back to sleep like depressed ones often do.

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:03.860
Maybe the angel waited all night and the king touched Elijah again and then gave him more nourishment.

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:11.860
Nourishment such that would take him 40 days and 40 nights on his journey to Mount Hora.

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:15.860
Now here's a question you have to ask yourself.

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:22.860
Do you think that that angel agreed with the way Elijah was acting?

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:33.860
Do you think the angel might have wanted to give a little counsel and tell Elijah, look Elijah, just get over it.

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:38.860
Just trust God and get back to your assignment.

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.860
But he didn't.

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:44.860
Do you think Jehovah knew how Elijah was thinking?

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.860
Do you think he agreed with it?

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:49.860
No, definitely not.

00:04:49.860 --> 00:05:00.860
The council may have handled it one way, but Jehovah, the God of all comfort, would first address Elijah's emotional needs.

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:08.860
So when Elijah finally entered the cave at Mount Hora, you remember what Jehovah did?

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:16.860
In a calm low voice, gentle voice, he said Elijah, what is your business here?

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.860
And that was a warm invitation for Elijah to express himself.

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.860
Just talk to me, you see.

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.860
And so Elijah did, look at verse 10.

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.860
And see, what was it Elijah said?

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:36.860
He said, I have been absolutely zealous for Jehovah the God of armies, for the people of Israel forsaken your covenant.

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:39.860
So Elijah felt like his work was in vain.

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:42.860
And then he said, I'm the only one left.

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:44.860
Elijah felt alone.

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:47.860
And he said, there are seeking to take me away.

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:49.860
Take my life away.

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.860
So Elijah was also afraid.

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:54.860
Would you overheard what he said?

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:58.860
And he addressed all of Elijah's concern.

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:09.860
And then afterwards, he gave Elijah the encouragement that would allow him to continue on in Jehovah's service with boldness.

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:12.860
So how can we learn from this brief experience?

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:19.860
Well, we learn that Jehovah validated the man's emotions without agreeing with his thinking.

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:25.860
And we also learn that it's often not necessary to offer a quick solution,

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:31.860
simply allowing a person to express themselves without feeling judged,

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:34.860
can bring tremendous relief.

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:45.860
In fact, friends, and being heard is so close to being loved that for the average person, it's indistinguishable.

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:57.860
Like Jehovah, we'll be more effective if we're patient shepherds that listen and give thoughtful consideration to the feelings of those that we're seeking to help.

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:00.860
So here are four takeaway points.

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:08.860
Number one, be a listener, not a lecturer, show empathy.

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:19.860
And remember, empathy is seeing with the eyes of another, hearing with the ears of another, and feeling with a heart of another.

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:31.860
It's easy, friends, for imperfect humans to take themselves too seriously, especially when they're given a position of responsibility.

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:44.399
So at times, it may even be best to refrain from offering counsel too soon, because that creates an air of superiority.

00:07:44.399 --> 00:07:54.399
Conversely, a willingness to hear even wild talk from another will reveal the depth of our own humility.

00:07:54.399 --> 00:07:59.399
Point number two, validate people's emotions.

00:07:59.399 --> 00:08:09.399
And don't just dismiss them, feelings are real, so know the difference between validating and invalidating statements.

00:08:09.399 --> 00:08:14.399
I can see why you would feel that way. That must be really hard.

00:08:14.399 --> 00:08:28.399
You see, when we listen with empathy, what we're really saying is, you matter to me, that you're important, and I care how you feel.

00:08:28.399 --> 00:08:37.399
Additionally, when you validate the other person, they become significantly more likely to listen to advice or counsel later.

00:08:37.399 --> 00:08:52.309
Remember, there is a difference between, and by the way, let me just say this, that counsel is not necessarily good just because it's accurate.

00:08:52.309 --> 00:08:57.309
Frankly, how you give it and when you give it is important.

00:08:57.309 --> 00:09:02.309
So try to remember that, just because it's accurate doesn't make it good.

00:09:02.309 --> 00:09:07.309
And there's a difference too between validating and devastating.

00:09:08.309 --> 00:09:16.309
You know, you're too sensitive. What's the big deal? I don't want to hear it.

00:09:16.309 --> 00:09:21.720
I don't have time for this. You need to work on your spirituality.

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:29.720
Now, although we may not mean it, this can translate into, you're not important.

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:39.100
Your feelings are important. And frankly, I don't really care. Point number three, acknowledge the vulnerability.

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:47.100
Sharing personal thoughts and emotions can be difficult, uncomfortable, and even scary.

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:53.100
But I think that we're encouraged to develop fellow feeling.

00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:58.100
And finally point number four, offering counsel is entirely optional.

00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:03.100
How many of us brothers have been on a shepherd and call, and we've said virtually nothing.

00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:12.919
Then the publisher, the brother's sister afterward says, you know what? That's the best shepherd I've ever had.

00:10:12.919 --> 00:10:18.919
So what some may need is not some solution for the problem, but simply to talk to a good listener.

00:10:18.919 --> 00:10:25.919
Someone who will not tell them how they're supposed to feel, but will listen without being judgmental.

00:10:26.919 --> 00:10:36.919
Saying his friends, time is life. If we won't give a brother our time, you really think we would give our life for him.

00:10:36.919 --> 00:10:44.919
So when we show favor to the lonely one by giving him time and attention, we are in fact lending to Jehovah.

00:10:44.919 --> 00:10:49.919
And the Bible says that he will repay us in our time of need.

00:10:49.919 --> 00:10:58.919
So we've counsel and shepherding together and you'll be treasured by all those around you and most of all by Jehovah God and Jesus Christ.
