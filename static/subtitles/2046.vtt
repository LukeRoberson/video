00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.480
Creating a set of blueprints for the construction of a house requires that the

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:13.080
architect consider each individual detail.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:20.100
But he must also ensure that everything harmonizes with the overall design.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.100
What about the design of life?

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:31.760
Do we also see evidence of careful planning and an overall harmony between living things?

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.759
Our world is filled with marvels of creation.

00:00:35.759 --> 00:00:38.759
Each wonderfully unique.

00:00:38.759 --> 00:00:45.759
Yet, as we have considered, all living organisms have something fundamental in common.

00:00:45.759 --> 00:00:48.759
Our DNA blueprint.

00:00:48.759 --> 00:00:54.759
From these incredibly tiny molecules come all the complexity and diversity of life.

00:00:54.759 --> 00:01:03.359
But even beyond the physical appearance, behaviors, abilities, and instincts of individual organisms,

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:10.359
DNA spells out the potential for amazing interactions between different creations.

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:20.930
The more we observe the natural world around us, the more we begin to see an underlying harmony emerging from the design of life.

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:27.930
For example, many flowering plants produce nectar, which serves as a food for insects and other animals.

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.930
But the benefit is not one-sided.

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:39.930
As bees drink nectar from a flower, they are dusted with tiny grains of pollen and carry these to other flowers of the same kind.

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.930
Many flowering plants and trees depend on this pollination to reproduce.

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:52.930
Yes, by wonderful design, bees, plants, animals, and humans all benefit from this relationship.

00:01:52.930 --> 00:02:02.010
Hidden beneath the soil, we find another beneficial relationship between plants and fungus.

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:12.009
Since they are unable to produce their own food, certain fungi infect the roots of plants and absorb carbohydrates from their host.

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:17.009
But instead of being harmful, the fungus can actually help the plant.

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:24.009
The filaments of the fungus provide a much greater surface area to absorb minerals and water, which are shared with the plant.

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:31.009
Additionally, the fungus can extend into soil that is inaccessible to the roots of the plant.

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:43.009
With this assistance, the plant is able to take in more nutrients from the soil, grow faster, and better tolerate extreme conditions.

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:50.960
Virtually all plants benefit from this type of helpful relationship with fungus.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:59.960
In the depths of the oceans, we find more alliances between different kinds of creatures, some very unexpected.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:08.960
Groups of large fish gather in areas where smaller, cleaner fish assist them by removing dead skin and parasites from the visitors.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:13.960
Under other circumstances, the larger fish might eat the smaller ones.

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:18.960
But at these cleaning stations, the large fish allow themselves to be attended to.

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:24.340
Most fish avoid the stinging tentacles of the sea anemone.

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.340
But the clown fish makes a home right in among them.

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:33.340
A special coating on its skin protects the clown fish from being stung.

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.340
In this way, the clown fish is safe from predators.

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:45.340
In return, the clown fish may share food with the anemone and provide protection against anemone eating fish.

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:52.780
Elsewhere, a goby fish and a shrimp live together in the shrimp's burrow.

00:03:53.780 --> 00:04:02.979
To protect its nearly blind host, the goby stands guard and taps the shrimp with its tail to warn of danger.

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:10.979
These are just a few examples of the interconnections we see all around us when we look more closely at the natural world.

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:17.980
How do these instinctively wise creatures know to form partnerships with others so different from themselves?

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:27.699
Somehow, the potential for these relationships is recorded within the DNA of each one.

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:38.699
Yes, life is not just a random collection of individual creations, but rather a marvelously orchestrated masterpiece of design.

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:47.699
Each living thing plays its part in perfect harmony with others around it, joining together in the magnificent symphony of life.

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:59.579
To learn more about creation is to gaze and wonder at design and engineering far superior to anything mankind has devised.

00:04:59.579 --> 00:05:05.579
It is to catch a glimpse of the mind of the master designer, Jehovah God.

00:05:05.579 --> 00:05:17.060
You are worthy, Jehovah, to receive the glory and the honor and the power, because you created all things.
