Setting up for a convention in a large stadium requires a lot of coordination.

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.750
So does the construction of our new world headquarters in Warwick, New York.

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:24.750
Hundreds of volunteers arrive every week to help out, all with a variety of construction skills.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:34.750
But one may ask, with so many people needed, how do we find the right people for the right job?

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:52.490
The answer is Warwick construction groups that have been set up all over the country.

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:56.490
The Warwick construction group is basically a staffing agency.

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:01.490
Local brothers are given the task to find and assess the construction skill level of volunteers,

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:06.489
and then forward that information to the branch.

00:01:06.489 --> 00:01:15.099
At that time we were working with 11 RBCs, roughly 25,000 volunteers.

00:01:15.099 --> 00:01:17.099
How are we going to contact them?

00:01:17.099 --> 00:01:22.099
We sent over 200,000 emails looking for skilled volunteers in various trades.

00:01:22.099 --> 00:01:28.099
Then we hit the road, 30 different locations around the state, and interviewed everyone they was interested in Warwick.

00:01:28.099 --> 00:01:38.909
Don't you think that it's even amazing that Jehovah assigns humans to do the work for him?

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:45.909
And he calls us, in 1 Corinthians 3 verse 9, he calls us fellow workers. What a beautiful expression.

00:01:45.909 --> 00:02:00.959
And what we find is everybody wants to go tomorrow.

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:08.960
And they're so willing to go to spend their own money, to sacrifice their time, play their own plane tickets,

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:18.960
and do so many things, that it's just a really encouraging thing to see such a fine willing spirit that could only exist among Jehovah's people.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:25.960
Volunteers have been organized into 23 different trades, which are managed from the field.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:34.960
Volunteers receive help with any questions, arrangements, or information about Bethel, as well as any Bethel training they may need.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:44.060
Over 7,000 interviews have already been conducted.

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:54.560
One of the first things that my middle son just said, and he's been wanting a cow for three years, we just got him one probably about two weeks ago.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:03.560
And the first thing that he said when he heard that dad was asked to leave next month to go was that he'd be willing to sell his cow.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.699
Her dad's in ticket.

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:18.699
So we're very excited about any opportunity like this to serve Jehovah in this way, because we feel like this building will stand into the new system,

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:23.699
and it's a chance to have a part in something that is so special.

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:26.699
And so we're, we're pumped, and we're ready for it.

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:29.699
We have a cow for sale.

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:37.330
The whole project of Warwick may be about building buildings, but it's the people that build them.

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:45.330
And we've had an extremely nice privilege in meeting all of these brothers and sisters, all of them willing to go today.

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:50.330
Many times, bad health keeps them from doing that.

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:57.330
We've heard stories from brothers that have undergone really bad things in their life, but they're really wanting to go.

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:02.330
One brother made the comment that his daughter had just died a few weeks before we interviewed him.

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:06.330
And he says, I just want to go to Warwick.

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:11.050
So I can poke Satan in the eye.

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:17.050
When you see Jehovah's people answer the call, there's nothing better than to be part of that.
