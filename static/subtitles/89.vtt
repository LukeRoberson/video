00:00:01.169 --> 00:00:26.179
Welcome to JW Broadcasting for February 2022.

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:32.179
Last month, we enjoyed part one of the 2021 annual meeting.

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:36.179
That program was filled with exciting announcements,

00:00:36.179 --> 00:00:42.179
videos, and stirring talks delivered by several members of the governing body.

00:00:42.179 --> 00:00:46.179
And it was so heartwarming to see a live audience

00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:52.179
of Bethel family members come together to enjoy this spiritual feast.

00:00:52.179 --> 00:00:58.179
Well, this month, we're happy to present the second half of the annual meeting program.

00:00:58.179 --> 00:01:02.179
We know you're going to thoroughly enjoy the encouraging updates,

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:06.180
interviews, and talks to follow.

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.180
Well, we know that the pandemic has altered all of our lives.

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:18.180
And we commend all in the worldwide brotherhood for your loyal response to direction.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:28.180
As you likely know, more specific direction and restrictions were recommended for those who serve as special full-time servants in the field.

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:34.180
Let's hear now from some of them about the unique circumstances they experienced.

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:47.379
Jehovah provides all of the things we need to accomplish our ministry and to feel secure no matter what tribulation we face.

00:01:47.379 --> 00:01:53.379
We truly have experienced Jehovah's loving support during this pandemic.

00:01:53.379 --> 00:02:03.379
Our Heavenly Father, through his organization, has provided just what we've needed to endure faithfully in our ministry and to stay strong spiritually.

00:02:03.379 --> 00:02:11.379
How has the direction to shelter in place affected circuit overseers, construction servants,

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:15.379
field missionaries, and special pioneers?

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:21.379
How have they been able to continue in their ministry serving Jehovah whole soul and with joy?

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:25.689
What practical lessons have they learned?

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:32.689
To follow the governing body's direction to shelter in place, we couldn't go in to see Steve's mother.

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:37.689
She was in aged care just 10 minutes away from where we're based.

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:41.689
She died whilst we were sheltering in place.

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:47.689
This led to another challenge, grieving in isolation.

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:52.689
At the beginning of the shelter in place direction, I had a very difficult time.

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:58.689
I had flashbacks that were very difficult for me.

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:06.689
During the Vietnam War, I was imprisoned because of taking a neutral stand.

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:13.689
I had a reaction to this lockdown of being confined.

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:18.689
Fear of isolation is the biggest challenge for me.

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:24.689
My lovely husband that I've been working with for years,

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:34.689
helping build places of worship for Jehovah was diagnosed with cancer and died after five months.

00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:39.689
We especially discerned the value of the direction in November 2020.

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:47.689
When suddenly, I was taken to the hospital because of a serious heart disease and severe pneumonia.

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:50.689
It turned out that my life was in danger.

00:03:50.689 --> 00:04:00.689
The doctors evaluated that if I had contracted the coronavirus in that condition, I would not have had a chance to survive it.

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:10.689
While sheltering in place, how did these obedient brothers and sisters stay positive and maintain their physical, emotional and spiritual health?

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:19.689
Even through the difficult time, having Zoom meetings, having the meetings for field service,

00:04:19.689 --> 00:04:26.689
doing witnessing by Zoom, being with the brothers and sisters, I can't say enough good about it.

00:04:26.689 --> 00:04:34.689
Being able to not meet an hour requirement, but go ahead and be very busy spiritually.

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:40.689
And so we did a phenomenal amount of shepherding, strengthening, upbuilding, or brothers and sisters,

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:44.689
folks literally from around the world that we knew needed help.

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:55.689
In the governing body, removed the specific hour requirement, I felt, I think we felt, their trust.

00:04:55.689 --> 00:04:58.689
That gave us more flexibility.

00:04:58.689 --> 00:05:07.689
And this enabled us to reach out to relatives not in the truth and to support them during the pandemic.

00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:13.689
And that has led to regular, continuing Bible studies.

00:05:13.689 --> 00:05:18.689
I really feel how much the governing body cares for us.

00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:24.689
Every time they mention in their letters, that they do not require us to reach the required hours.

00:05:25.689 --> 00:05:31.689
Many brothers and sisters today are depressed and experiencing pandemic fatigue.

00:05:31.689 --> 00:05:35.689
Usually, they need someone who they can talk to about their problems.

00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:43.689
And because of these adjustments, I now have more time to encourage them and help them to remain spiritually strong.

00:05:44.689 --> 00:05:56.689
One sister and I decided to take two hours every day to engage in phone waiting for the first time,

00:05:56.689 --> 00:06:00.689
even though we didn't know how to go about it.

00:06:00.689 --> 00:06:09.689
The secretary of a salesversate taught me how to talk about the phone and how to help people I find and to keep their interest.

00:06:10.689 --> 00:06:18.689
Since most congregations I served don't have internet access, I make video recordings for all talks.

00:06:18.689 --> 00:06:25.970
I make a simple platform and set up the microphone and cell phone I used to create the video.

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:28.970
Then I stand in front and start giving the talk.

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:35.339
What blessings did they receive from their obedience?

00:06:35.339 --> 00:06:40.339
I was so happy to start a Bible study during the pandemic.

00:06:40.339 --> 00:06:45.339
Especially when I saw how quickly the student was making progress.

00:06:45.339 --> 00:06:50.339
Because of my health, each study session was about 15 to 20 minutes long.

00:06:50.339 --> 00:06:56.339
I had to find a good place to conduct the study at the hospital, mainly in the hallway.

00:06:56.339 --> 00:07:02.339
One day after the concluding prayer, I noticed the door to a doctor's office was open.

00:07:02.339 --> 00:07:07.339
The doctor was listening to our whole Bible study discussion.

00:07:07.339 --> 00:07:12.129
I was so happy she attended the study as well.

00:07:12.129 --> 00:07:19.129
I am studying with sucks of my relatives from the standard family who previously opposed their goodness.

00:07:19.129 --> 00:07:27.129
One of them also told me of the husband noticing they're changing her in the way she treats and talks to her.

00:07:27.129 --> 00:07:33.129
As a result, the husband and four of their children are also learning the truth.

00:07:33.129 --> 00:07:38.129
This from Jehovah has really kept me going.

00:07:38.129 --> 00:07:45.129
Recently in my circuit, 59 Bible students progressed to baptism.

00:07:45.129 --> 00:07:49.129
Unity within families is another blessing.

00:07:49.129 --> 00:07:58.129
Parents are spending a lot of time conducting Bible studies with their children.

00:07:58.129 --> 00:08:04.129
Our Christian life is compared to a race, and this is not a short race.

00:08:04.129 --> 00:08:07.129
There are unexpected things that can happen to us.

00:08:07.129 --> 00:08:22.449
By striving to obey from the heart now, we can be prepared to obey the directions that we are going to receive and the great tribulation.

00:08:22.449 --> 00:08:26.449
We are sure this is not the last time we have to be obedient.

00:08:26.449 --> 00:08:35.450
We see Bible prophecies being fulfilled right in front of our eyes and ahead of us are even greater events that will bring larger trials.

00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:43.450
James, chapter 1, verses 2 and 3, helps us despite trials to keep joy, deep joy in our hearts.

00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:49.450
And it ensures us that all difficult situations will help us to work on endurance.

00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:53.450
And this quality will help to cope with trials to come.

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:59.759
I personally have benefited from following the governing body's direction.

00:08:59.759 --> 00:09:12.759
I've actually felt joy every day, and I can only put that down to the blessing from Jehovah God on our efforts to be obedient.

00:09:12.759 --> 00:09:23.759
We both benefited from the direction from the governing body because we trust they are the faithful and discrete slave Christ Jesus is directing them.

00:09:23.759 --> 00:09:37.759
I am so absolutely grateful to the governing body for providing direction that is blessing every single one of us around the earth.

00:09:37.759 --> 00:09:46.759
Just like you, these dear ones have made great sacrifices to continue serving Jehovah whole soul during this pandemic.

00:09:46.759 --> 00:09:52.759
And no doubt we've all learned the value of applying the words of 2 Timothy, chapter 4, verse 2.

00:09:52.759 --> 00:10:00.759
Preach the word. Be edit urgently in favorable times and difficult times.

00:10:00.759 --> 00:10:23.720
For a certainty, neither this pandemic nor any other difficult times to come will stop our preaching work and more importantly, prevent Jehovah's loving care.

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:33.720
We certainly express our love and appreciation to all of our special full-time servants in the field for the excellent example they've set in following direction.

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:44.720
Well, as a very appropriate follow-up to the two preceding video presentations, we're happy now to have our very dear brother, Garrett Loesch, a member of the governing body,

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:54.720
to provide comfort for all of us with his talk entitled, no resident will say, I am sick.

00:10:54.720 --> 00:11:05.720
Aren't we all glad that we are healthy enough to be able to listen to the annual meeting program? Yes, we don't want to take it for granted.

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:15.720
Worldwide, some 20,000 of our brothers and sisters died so far from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:25.720
But tens of thousands of our brothers and sisters, including many relatives, have been and are now affected emotionally by this fact.

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:32.720
Death toll affects friends and family and the feeling of loss is deep.

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:41.720
Secular sources say that the overall death rate in the United States is about 1% of the population each year.

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:48.720
Every year around the world an average of over 60 million people die.

00:11:48.720 --> 00:12:03.419
The daily average is about 164,000. How sad. With a COVID-19 plague, the number of total death worldwide is of course higher.

00:12:03.419 --> 00:12:12.419
In the United States over 600,000 citizens died from COVID-19 alone.

00:12:12.419 --> 00:12:23.419
Even when tempered by the hope of the resurrection, the death of a loved one is still a traumatic loss which is deeply felt.

00:12:23.419 --> 00:12:33.419
Years perhaps decades of close companionship and sharing are suddenly and tragically ended.

00:12:34.419 --> 00:12:43.419
Of course, if those that died were part of our family, it affects you much more emotionally.

00:12:43.419 --> 00:12:52.419
We are also affected because we did not expect them to die except perhaps if somewhere in the 80s or 90s.

00:12:52.419 --> 00:13:02.419
Even though you know that they will come back, you still feel hurt and are very sorry to have temporarily lost them.

00:13:03.419 --> 00:13:09.419
It is very sad to lose somebody in death, even temporarily, isn't it?

00:13:09.419 --> 00:13:23.110
In the case of Lazarus, the Bible shows that even Jesus shed tears when he saw the emotional pain experienced by Lazarus sisters.

00:13:24.110 --> 00:13:34.110
To be sad and to cry in the case of somebody's death is not an indication of somebody's lack of faith or an emotional imbalance.

00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:38.110
Never feel ashamed in such a case.

00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:44.950
Feel free to give way to tears.

00:13:44.950 --> 00:13:52.950
At John, chapter 5, 28 and 29, Jesus promises comforting.

00:13:52.950 --> 00:13:54.950
He said,

00:13:54.950 --> 00:14:13.950
Do not be amazed at this because the hour is coming in which all those in the memorial tombs will hear the Son of God's voice and come out, those who did good things to a resurrection of life, those who practiced while things to a resurrection of judgment.

00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:27.950
However, Jehovah foretold that sickness and death will not continue forever but a temporary now and will soon end as the new world arrives.

00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:41.950
Even in the past, Jehovah miraculously proved that he is able to prevent sickness and subsequent death, and he proved that he has the power to bring back humans to life.

00:14:41.950 --> 00:14:57.950
As much as we are sorry to have lost relatives and or friends in death due to COVID-19 or any other reason, we can rejoice that Jehovah will bring them back in the resurrection.

00:14:57.950 --> 00:15:03.950
Jehovah brought back some of his servants in the resurrection in the past.

00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:08.950
The Bible speaks of nine specific resurrections of individuals.

00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:15.950
Instead of reading a list with their names, you can try to recall who these persons were.

00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:24.950
If you don't come up with the nine persons, why not make it a part of a conversation with friends to complete the list?

00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:29.950
It refers to Jesus and eight additional ones.

00:15:29.950 --> 00:15:35.950
It is so encouraging and comforting to talk about it.

00:15:35.950 --> 00:15:50.950
Hebrews 11.35 speaks of a better resurrection, better than the resurrection of the eight persons mentioned in the Bible who had to die again at the later day.

00:15:51.950 --> 00:16:02.950
The future resurrection is better because it contains the possibility to never die again in all eternity.

00:16:02.950 --> 00:16:16.950
Imagine to live not only for a thousand years, but for a million years, for ten million years, for a hundred million years, for a hundred billion years and so on.

00:16:16.950 --> 00:16:30.950
As for those being brought back in the resurrection, the resurrection will be perceived like having happened in the blink of an eye after their death, although they may have been dead for quite some time.

00:16:30.950 --> 00:16:40.299
For instance, when Lazarus was resurrected, he did not recall that he was laying in the tomb.

00:16:40.299 --> 00:16:48.299
When he was resurrected, to him it was like the next moment after he lost consciousness from dying.

00:16:48.299 --> 00:16:54.299
When he came to himself, he had no perception that he was in the tomb.

00:16:54.299 --> 00:17:01.299
Jehovah created man originally. He can also recreate a human.

00:17:02.299 --> 00:17:08.299
Psalm 104, 29 and 30 say,

00:17:08.299 --> 00:17:12.299
When you hide your face, they are disturbed.

00:17:12.299 --> 00:17:17.299
If you take away their spirit, they die and return to the dust.

00:17:17.299 --> 00:17:21.299
If you send out their spirit, they are created.

00:17:21.299 --> 00:17:27.299
Jehovah will give the resurrected ones a body just as it pleases him.

00:17:27.299 --> 00:17:37.299
Their bodies will be physically sound and obviously look similar to their original body, so that they will be recognized by their loved ones.

00:17:37.299 --> 00:17:47.299
Faithful Christians who die late during the time of the end will likely be among the first ones to be raised again.

00:17:47.299 --> 00:17:58.299
We can also expect an early resurrection for some of the faithful men of old who will join others as princes in a new world.

00:17:58.299 --> 00:18:03.299
Nevertheless, we should not be dogmatic on such matters.

00:18:03.299 --> 00:18:08.299
On many issues related to the resurrection, the Bible is silent.

00:18:08.299 --> 00:18:17.299
It does not spell out details of how, when or at what locations the resurrection of individuals will occur.

00:18:17.299 --> 00:18:24.299
It does not tell us how those returning will be housed, fed and clothed.

00:18:24.299 --> 00:18:32.299
It would be unwise to spend a lot of time trying to find answers that are at present, unanswerable.

00:18:32.299 --> 00:18:38.299
It is best to just focus on the fact of the resurrection to come.

00:18:38.299 --> 00:18:51.700
1 Corinthians 15-52 also speaks of the resurrection, but not of an earthly resurrection, but a heavenly spiritual one.

00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:59.700
This text refers to anointed ones who would die and be raised in the blink of an eye.

00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:05.700
This resurrection began during our time, the time of the end.

00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:12.700
When they die, they go to heaven in an instant, like during the blink of an eye.

00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:25.700
But those who have the earthly hope to live forever on earth in paradise also will have the same perception later when they will be resurrected in the paradise.

00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:33.700
The time from their death to the moment of their resurrection will not be consciously experienced by them.

00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:37.700
It will be for them like the blinking of an eye.

00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:45.180
Those resurrected to heaven will obtain immortality.

00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:55.180
Those resurrected on earth will not be immortal, but have the chance to live forever as long as they remain faithful.

00:19:55.180 --> 00:20:05.619
In connection with the ancient Israelites, Jehovah also proved that she is able to protect his people from sicknesses.

00:20:05.619 --> 00:20:11.019
And he did it when the Israelites remained faithful.

00:20:11.019 --> 00:20:18.019
Deuteronomy 715 foretold in connection with those who escaped from Egypt,

00:20:18.019 --> 00:20:30.430
Jehovah will take away from you all sickness, and he will not bring upon you any of the terrible diseases that you have known in Egypt.

00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:33.430
We can trust that Jehovah fulfilled his promise.

00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:37.430
He did so when the Israelites were faithful.

00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:42.430
He blessed the Israelites with good health and long life.

00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:46.430
This shows his past love for the people of Israel.

00:20:46.430 --> 00:20:57.839
It also indicates his power and that if he wishes to repeat this miracle, he can do it, of course.

00:20:57.839 --> 00:21:05.839
He will do so after Armageddon during the millennium or a thousand year reign of Christ.

00:21:05.839 --> 00:21:11.839
Revelation 22 verse 2 foretells the healing of the nations.

00:21:11.839 --> 00:21:17.839
This includes physical and emotional healing in the new world.

00:21:17.839 --> 00:21:24.839
Death is really an enemy, but Jehovah will do away with it.

00:21:24.839 --> 00:21:29.839
Isaiah 33, 24, it says that in the new world,

00:21:29.839 --> 00:21:34.839
quote, no resident will say, I am sick.

00:21:34.839 --> 00:21:46.539
There will be no hospitals, there will be no drugstores, there will be no physicians, there will be no professional nurses.

00:21:47.539 --> 00:21:56.539
In Revelation 21 4, it foretells that in the new world there will be neither morning nor outcry, nor pain anymore.

00:21:56.539 --> 00:22:06.069
We are very sad about what happened around the world with so many of our brothers and sisters falling asleep from COVID-19 recently,

00:22:06.069 --> 00:22:10.069
but we know they will come back.

00:22:10.069 --> 00:22:13.069
They will come back healthy.

00:22:13.069 --> 00:22:17.069
They will not come back looking like old people.

00:22:18.069 --> 00:22:26.069
Even if they died at 80 years, they might look like they are in their 30s when resurrected.

00:22:26.069 --> 00:22:35.069
As stated earlier, they will look reasonably similar to their original body so that they will be recognized by their loved ones.

00:22:35.069 --> 00:22:45.539
How it feels our hearts with love for Jehovah, that he will bring back in the resurrection of our loved ones.

00:22:46.539 --> 00:22:49.539
The Apostle Paul had a firm hope.

00:22:49.539 --> 00:22:54.539
He explained that 2 Corinthians 1 verse 7,

00:22:54.539 --> 00:23:04.539
quote, our hope for you is unwavering, knowing as we do that, just as you are shares of the sufferings,

00:23:04.539 --> 00:23:10.400
in the same way you will also share the comfort.

00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:14.400
At the conclusion of his letter, Paul urged,

00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:21.400
continue to be comforted, and the God of love and of peace will be with you.

00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:26.740
What an important lesson we can learn from this.

00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:34.740
All members of the Christian congregation need to share the comfort that God provides through his word,

00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:38.740
his Holy Spirit, and his earthly organization.

00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:43.740
The principle source of comfort is, of course, Jehovah himself.

00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:50.740
There is no real lasting comfort that does not originate with God.

00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:53.740
Appropriately then, Paul wrote, quote,

00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:59.740
Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of tender mercies,

00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:05.740
and the God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our tribulation.

00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:18.309
What inspiring words, the Greek word here rendered comfort, is linked to a calling to one side.

00:24:19.309 --> 00:24:27.690
Therefore, it is the standing beside a person to encourage him when he is undergoing severe testing.

00:24:27.690 --> 00:24:30.690
One biblical scholar wrote,

00:24:30.690 --> 00:24:36.690
The word always means far more than soothing sympathy.

00:24:36.690 --> 00:24:47.700
Christian comfort is the comfort which brings courage, the comfort which enables a man to cope with all that life can do to him.

00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:57.700
It also includes comforting words that are based on a solid promise and hope, that of the resurrection of the dead.

00:24:57.700 --> 00:25:03.700
So what can we do to enhance the comfort to others?

00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:11.700
Listen, one of the most helpful things you can do is to share the brief ones pain by listening.

00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:16.700
You may ask, would you care to talk about it?

00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:20.700
One Christian recalls when his father died.

00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:27.700
It really helped me when others asked what happened and then really listened.

00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:31.700
Listen patiently and sympathetically.

00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:38.700
Weep with people who we recommends the Bible at Romans 12 verse 15.

00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:47.700
Be available. Make yourself available not just for the first few days when many friends and relatives are present,

00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:55.700
but for months later, if necessary, when others have returned to their normal routine.

00:25:55.700 --> 00:26:02.700
Our Christian interest and sympathy can mean so much in any time of need.

00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:08.700
The Bible says that there exists a friend sticking closer than a brother.

00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:17.180
Talk about the good qualities of the deceased person. This is another great help.

00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:27.180
Share positive anecdotes that you recall about the individual and do not be afraid to use the person's name.

00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:32.180
Write a letter or send a comforting card.

00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:39.180
Often overlooked is the value of a condolence letter or a beautiful sympathy card.

00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:44.180
It's advantage. It can be read over and over again.

00:26:44.180 --> 00:26:52.190
Such a letter need not be long, but it should show your compassion.

00:26:52.190 --> 00:27:01.190
Pray with them. Do not underestimate the value of your prayers with and for bereaved fellow Christians.

00:27:01.190 --> 00:27:10.190
The Bible says that James 516, a righteous man's supplication has much force.

00:27:10.190 --> 00:27:18.890
Encourage sufferers to meditate on Jehovah. He is the God of all comfort.

00:27:18.890 --> 00:27:27.890
He said in Isaiah, I, I myself am the one that is comforting you people.

00:27:28.890 --> 00:27:37.890
He also said, like a man whom his own mother keeps comforting, so I myself shall keep comforting you people.

00:27:37.890 --> 00:27:52.089
Find with me Psalm 119. Let's first read verses 50 and 52.

00:27:52.089 --> 00:27:58.089
This is my comfort in my affliction for you are saying has preserved me alive.

00:27:59.089 --> 00:28:08.089
Verse 52, I remember your judgments from of old Old Jehovah and I find comfort in them.

00:28:08.089 --> 00:28:21.089
And now, even verse 76, may you a loyal love please comfort me according to the promise you made to your servant.

00:28:21.089 --> 00:28:27.089
Note that the word comfort is used repeatedly in those passages.

00:28:27.089 --> 00:28:37.089
Yes, we can find true comfort for ourselves and for others by turning to Jehovah's word in our time of affliction.

00:28:37.089 --> 00:28:50.089
This combined with the love and compassion of the brothers can help us to live through our loss and fill our lives again with joyful activity in the Christian ministry.

00:28:51.089 --> 00:29:00.089
What a privilege to worship the Almighty, our loving God Jehovah, who will bring back our loved ones in the resurrection.

00:29:00.089 --> 00:29:13.089
There will never again be a pandemic to claim the life of faithful servants, because at that time no resident will say, I am sick.

00:29:18.950 --> 00:29:31.950
We truly thank you for those very comforting, loving words. We really felt your love for the worldwide brotherhood and certainly those words were food at the proper time.

00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:46.950
Well, now we're going to change the direction somewhat with a talk from another member of the governing body, brother Stephen let his topic is we can be victorious over Satan's attack.

00:29:46.950 --> 00:30:03.299
What will you do in the face of Satan's attack? Well, that's a relevant question for all of us here, because without exception we're under a vicious intense attack.

00:30:03.299 --> 00:30:16.299
But the question is, as the battle intensifies in our individual cases, will we be able to stand our ground bravely fight and come off victorious?

00:30:16.299 --> 00:30:31.299
Well, obviously your desire is to be victorious, isn't it? You wouldn't be attending this special program, but we need more than just the desire if we're going to ensure victory.

00:30:31.299 --> 00:30:45.299
In fact, to win any battle we need accurate knowledge of three things. We need to know our enemy, know his strategy and know what we have to defend ourselves.

00:30:45.299 --> 00:31:01.299
Now first, let's talk about our enemy, Satan. He is no ordinary foe. Jehovah educates this regarding this enemy. We're fighting. For one thing, he's a premeditated murderer.

00:31:01.299 --> 00:31:13.299
Look at what he did to Job's attendance slaughtered them with marauder bands. Others were consumed with fire. Look at what he did to Job's ten children.

00:31:13.299 --> 00:31:27.299
He murdered simultaneously all ten of them with a violent windstorm. Yes, he's a premeditated murderer. He wants to murder into everlasting death. Every one of us here.

00:31:27.299 --> 00:31:40.299
Now on top of this, he is highly intelligent. As one brother said, he may be evil, wicked, murderous, but he's not stupid. He's highly intelligent.

00:31:40.299 --> 00:31:52.299
In fact, think about this. The fact that he was once in the truth makes him more intelligent in a sense or we could say clever because he has knowledge of having been in the truth.

00:31:52.299 --> 00:32:14.299
John 844, he did not stand fast in the truth, but he was in the truth. Not to illustrate how this makes me more dangerous. Think about a few of the false brothers during World War II who left the truth and joined the Nazis in persecuting the brothers in the truth.

00:32:14.299 --> 00:32:25.299
They had knowledge of who were taking the lead. They knew where they lived. They knew the strategy that was being utilized. They were more dangerous, weren't they? Well, the same with Satan.

00:32:25.299 --> 00:32:39.299
Second Corinthians 1114 says Satan keeps disguising himself as an angel of light. Now it's very easy for him to pretend to be what he used to be.

00:32:39.299 --> 00:32:55.299
So that makes him more dangerous. Now open up please to Revelation chapter 12, very familiar scripture. But that's reason on this to help us further, not underestimate underrate our enemy.

00:32:55.299 --> 00:32:58.299
Revelation chapter 12 verse 7.

00:33:25.299 --> 00:33:38.299
He was hurled down to the earth and his angels were hurled down with him. And then look at verse 12. On this account be glad you heavens and you who reside in them.

00:33:38.299 --> 00:33:50.299
Whoa for the earth and for the sea because the devil has come down to you having great anger knowing that he has a short period of time.

00:33:50.299 --> 00:34:07.299
Now you notice he's not just mad. He has great anger. Why is he so angry? Well for one thing, after he lost the war in heaven, he wasn't merely asked to leave heaven and he quietly left.

00:34:07.299 --> 00:34:20.300
We read he was hurled out of heaven and that denotes thrown with great force. So that undoubtedly added to his great anger. But also think about this.

00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:35.300
The tremendous reduction of his fear of movement adds undoubtedly to his great anger. Before being cast out of heaven, apparently he had access to the vast, vast physical spiritual heavens.

00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:47.300
But now confined to the vicinity of this little tiny earth. And if you think about it, not only is that making map, it makes him more dangerous doesn't.

00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:59.300
Before being cast out of heaven, undoubtedly, he would try to turn away the angels part of the time. He would try to turn away human sea. He was divided in his attention.

00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:11.300
But now we have his undivided attention, don't we? So that's bad for us. And that makes him dangerous. Here's another illustration about the increasing of the danger.

00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:30.300
I'd like you to imagine that all of the mafia members, all of the drug cartel members and all of the terrorists of the entire planet earth were gathered up and were confined to New York City, the city limits. And you live there too.

00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:42.300
Now can you imagine the escalation of crime and evil that would take place there? Additionally, we read he's mad and angry because he knows his time is short.

00:35:42.300 --> 00:36:00.300
Now if that's true back around 1914, what about today over a hundred years later? He knows his expiration date is almost here. So you had it all up. His anger is truly really white hot, you could say.

00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:11.300
And he has hordes of demon helpers that makes him more dangerous too. Do you think it would be possible for a demon to block one of Jehovah's good angels?

00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:24.300
Well, be careful how you answer that. Daniel chapter 10 verse 13 talks about the demon prince of Persia blocking for 21 days, Jehovah's good angel.

00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:49.300
Now how was that possible? Well, we don't know for sure, but perhaps the demon prince before becoming a demon had been a cherub or a serif. And maybe the one sent on the assignment a messenger angel. Of course, Michael came to help the good angel and he was able to get past that demon, but that scripture in others help us not to underestimate the demons.

00:36:49.300 --> 00:37:16.300
We can't underestimate the ruler of the demons nor these demons that work under his supervision. So adding it up, we find that Satan is a premeditated murderer. He's highly intelligent. He has great anger because of his great reduction of sphere of movement and because of his expiration of time. And he has hordes of demon helpers.

00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:33.300
Now Jehovah's given us all this information, not to just fill up pages in the Bible, but so we are determined to recognize the enemy we're up against and we're determined to fight even harder so that we can be victorious.

00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:42.300
But now let's take a little time to get to know our enemy strategy. Again, thanks to Jehovah we're not in the dark are we?

00:37:43.300 --> 00:38:09.300
Second Corinthians 211. So that we may not be overreached by Satan for we are not ignorant of his designs. Why are we not ignorant? Well, very kind of Jehovah's exposed the full spectrum of saints, designs, his strategies, his maneuvers, he's exposed all of them in his word, the Bible.

00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:31.300
Now that's very kind of Jehovah, isn't it? Very kind of Jehovah, even though the Bible was written, the completion of it over 1900 years ago. Jehovah 100 years, let's say after the Bible has been written, he doesn't come to the realization. Oh, no, I forgot to put one of Satan's tricks in the Bible.

00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:40.300
Oh, no, my people won't be ready for it. No, Jehovah has exposed every one of them say in his word, the Bible.

00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:51.300
Well, what two basic categories does God's word indicate that same strategies can be divided into? Well, first we have the frontal attack.

00:38:51.300 --> 00:39:05.300
Now, that's characterized by bannings, imprisonment, threats, and acts of violence, such as it was used in our brothers in Malawi in the past and is being used today in Russia on our brothers.

00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:20.300
And you don't have to scratch your head and say, I wonder if I'm being persecuted. When you have the frontal attack, it's obvious isn't. It's clear. See, the frontal attack has this proved to be Satan's most successful method of attack.

00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:36.300
No, not really. Here's just one experience of thousands that could be related to substantiate this point. Now this experience centers around the 29 year old brother named August Dickman.

00:39:36.300 --> 00:40:00.300
Now, you probably remember this experience, but he was put in socks in house and concentration camp, 1937. But then two days or three days after World War II began, 1939, he was ordered to sign his military induction slip. Of course, he refused to do that. Now, the camp commander was furious.

00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:13.300
So he got permission from him or the head of the SS guard to publicly execute August in front of all the camp inmates.

00:40:13.300 --> 00:40:26.300
And he arranged a special assembly after he got this permission and he had Jehovah's Witnesses right down front where they would get the full impact of the execution of our dear brother.

00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:34.300
Well, after he was executed, all the other inmates were dismissed. But Jehovah's Witnesses had to stay.

00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:52.300
And with great enthusiasm, the camp commander said to the witnesses there, he said, who is now ready to sign the declaration? Well, not one of more than 400 witnesses responded.

00:40:52.300 --> 00:41:07.300
But then to step forward. No, not to sign, but to ask that their signatures given about a year earlier, the annulled what a slap in Satan's face.

00:41:07.300 --> 00:41:15.300
And that really illustrates the poor success rate of this frontal attack. See, and many other experiences could be related.

00:41:15.300 --> 00:41:25.300
And it's certainly proving true of our brothers in Russia today, including elderly ones, the frontal attack of very poor success rate, slap in Satan's face.

00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:36.300
But now, what is the second category of strategy that sadly has claimed many spiritual victims? Let's go to Ephesians chapter six.

00:41:36.300 --> 00:41:56.300
And here we can identify, in verse 11, this second category, put on the complete suit of armor from God so that you may be able to stand firm against the crafty acts of the devil.

00:41:56.300 --> 00:42:08.300
So notice that crafty sneaky underhanded, devious. Well, Satan uses these and he's brought down many away from Jehovah out of the truth.

00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:22.300
These crafty acts remind me of an illustration years ago in one of our publications of a soldier who was looking in the distance for the enemy to come over the horizon. He was looking for the frontal attack.

00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:42.300
But he wasn't looking in the rocks down by seat. There was a poisonous snake lurking and that powerfully made the point you have to watch yes for the frontal attack, but especially the snake in the rocks attacks of the devil that can really bring you down without you realizing what has happened.

00:42:43.300 --> 00:43:06.300
But Jehovah assures us we can succeed and try up thing over both of these categories of attacks. In fact, Psalm 913, a beautiful thought he says, and Jehovah assures, you will trample underfoot the main lion and the big snake.

00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:20.300
And the insight book explains that apparently in that scripture, the main lion represents the frontal attack, the open attacks of Satan, whereas the big snake represents the sneaky crafty acts of the devil.

00:43:20.300 --> 00:43:31.300
But Jehovah says, you will trample both of them underfoot so we can be successful over both of them. Well, what are some of these snake like crafty acts?

00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:55.300
Let's just discuss two examples. Here's one materialism. Now this is brought down many elders, ministerial servants, pioneers, publishers, very successful crafty act of the devil. It's no coincidence that this world is powerfully geared to promote materialism.

00:43:55.300 --> 00:44:16.300
Relentless advertising messages are designed to indoctrinate deeply the idea that acquiring abundant material possessions and acquiring happiness are inseparably linked and directly proportional. That's really the message that world gives isn't that true.

00:44:16.300 --> 00:44:37.300
And if we're not careful, we can begin to think like this advertising messages wants to think that we're a poor, poor loser if we don't acquire abundant material things. So what can happen? We can get sucked into this little by little. We buy one item. No problem. We can handle that.

00:44:37.300 --> 00:44:54.300
We buy something else. Well, now we need to work a little bit of overtime to make the payments. We keep buying. Now we need to take a second job. Little by little, we're missing meeting service less time for personal study, the more important things and little by little.

00:44:54.300 --> 00:45:07.300
We could call Satan the God of gradualism will take us away from Jehovah by means of materialism. Well, here's one more example. Bad association.

00:45:07.300 --> 00:45:29.300
First Corinthians 1533, Jehovah says, do not be misled. Bad associations spoil useful habits. We might try to mislead ourselves. Oh, I can handle it. I'm strong enough. Maybe I'll even bring this person into the truth or others may try to mislead us.

00:45:29.300 --> 00:45:48.610
But Jehovah says, do not be misled. And then he gives the terrible consequences. Think of this illustration. If you lock a man and a skunk in a closet, when they come out, will the skunk smell like the man?

00:45:48.610 --> 00:45:58.610
Or will the man smell like the skunk? Well, you know, the answer. And Jehovah knows he works the same way with bad association.

00:45:58.610 --> 00:46:21.610
Well, those are just two examples of crafty acts of the devil. There are many others. They're all exposed, though, as we said before, Jehovah kindly has done that. But now think of this. Think of this illustration. If you're walking in darkness with a loving friend, and he shines a flashlight on a trap that is right in front of you.

00:46:21.610 --> 00:46:36.610
Does the light of that flashlight remove the trap? No, it just shows you where it is. Now it's up to us to go around the trap. Isn't that true? How foolish to go ahead and step in that trap that our friend has illuminated.

00:46:36.610 --> 00:46:42.610
Well, Jehovah is the friend in that illustration, but we have to do our part, don't we?

00:46:42.610 --> 00:46:54.610
Well, we thus far discussed our evil enemy, his sinister strategy, which Jehovah's exposed. But now what do we have to defend ourselves?

00:46:54.610 --> 00:47:12.610
One major component of our defenses is knowledge. See what we just discussed knowing our enemy, knowing your strategy, and then why is the utilizing that knowledge provides a real protection for us?

00:47:12.610 --> 00:47:30.610
There's a saying to be forewarned is to be forearmed. Similarly, Proverbs chapter 4 verses 5 and 6 says in part, acquire wisdom, acquire understanding, and it will protect you.

00:47:30.610 --> 00:47:44.610
But now additionally, we have our spiritual armor. Ephesians 6, 12, and 13 says in part that we have a struggle against the wicked spirit forces in the heavenly places.

00:47:44.610 --> 00:47:56.610
For this reason, take up the complete suit of armor from God so that you may be able to resist and stand firm.

00:47:56.610 --> 00:48:08.610
We've had some beautiful watch star study articles recently about each of those six pieces of that armor and how we can put on and keep on each piece of the armor.

00:48:08.610 --> 00:48:21.340
Without our armor, we are defenseless. We'd be like a soldier on a raging battlefield dressed only in his underwear.

00:48:21.340 --> 00:48:35.340
How long do you think he would survive minutes if that long? And not only do we need the armor, we need every piece of the armor. And that's what Ephesians 6, 13 says the complete suit of armor.

00:48:35.340 --> 00:48:45.340
One piece of armor missing could be tragic. Now let's illustrate this. Let's say a soldier forgets to put on his boot like sandals.

00:48:45.340 --> 00:48:59.340
He goes out into this raging battlefield and he steps on a long sharp thorn just as he's attacked by an enemy soldier who is going to win. Well, it's obvious we need every piece of the armor.

00:48:59.340 --> 00:49:19.340
Additionally, an indispensable part of our defense system is Jehovah's Holy Spirit. Zachary 46. The thought is made not by military force nor by power, but by my spirit says Jehovah of armies.

00:49:19.340 --> 00:49:34.340
See, we don't fight this battle in our own strength. We have to have Jehovah's Holy Spirit. And if we have Holy Spirit, we're empowered by it. If we think about there is no breaking point to our integrity.

00:49:34.340 --> 00:49:44.340
You probably have heard the illustration of the straw that broke the camel's back. And literally with a camel, you could keep piling more and more weight.

00:49:44.340 --> 00:49:50.340
That finally you could put so much weight just a little more weight you could break his back saying could do that to us.

00:49:51.340 --> 00:50:04.340
If we were on our own, but Jehovah knows when we've done our part, we've gone as far as our imperfect flesh will take us and then he steps in and makes up any deficit.

00:50:04.340 --> 00:50:18.340
Satan piles more. Jehovah makes up the shortfall. Satan piles more. Jehovah makes us equal to that challenge. And since Jehovah is the almighty, there is literally no breaking point to our integrity.

00:50:19.340 --> 00:50:34.340
In fact, one brother living in a band country refused to violate his Christian neutrality. So he was strip naked forced to lie face down and ruthlessly beaten for six hours on his back and his legs.

00:50:34.340 --> 00:50:46.340
Spectators fainted with so ruthless. But yet here's what that brother said sometime later. He said regardless of the amount of insulting and beatings that we received.

00:50:47.340 --> 00:51:00.340
A few seconds would pass and we would not feel anything more even though the beatings continued. We were feeling that Jehovah God was always with us.

00:51:00.340 --> 00:51:13.340
Well, there we have three aspects of our defense system. There are others, but we discuss we have God given knowledge. See, we know our enemy, we know his strategy, we know what we have to defend ourselves.

00:51:13.340 --> 00:51:25.340
But then we have our spiritual armor and we have Jehovah's Holy Spirit. If we do our part, unquestionably, Jehovah always does his part.

00:51:25.340 --> 00:51:38.340
And this combination is going to be uncarkable. So as the battle intensifies in our individual cases, we're not going to have to turn and cowardly flee.

00:51:38.340 --> 00:51:58.510
We'll be able to stand our ground. We'll be able to bravely fight. And with Jehovah's help, we will come off completely victorious in the face of Satan's attack.

00:51:58.510 --> 00:52:08.510
We thank you so much for that encouragement, that strength, that no weapon formed against God's people will have any success.

00:52:08.510 --> 00:52:20.510
And it's a good opportunity to remember the 129 of our dear brothers and sisters around the world who are presently in prison because of their faith.

00:52:20.510 --> 00:52:37.510
You remember what Hebrews chapter 13 and verse 3 says, keep in mind those in prison as though you were imprisoned with them and those being mistreated since you yourselves are also in the body.

00:52:37.510 --> 00:52:46.510
We certainly love and respect our brothers in Russia and in many other lands that are facing cruel persecution.

00:52:46.510 --> 00:53:01.510
Well, we still have two members of the governing body that we want to hear from. But before we do, we would like to give you an update on the project that audio video services is spearheading at the Austral Asia branch.

00:53:01.510 --> 00:53:14.210
You'll recall that it was announced at last year's annual meeting. So what has been happening with this video project in this intervening time? Please pay close attention.

00:53:14.210 --> 00:53:27.210
At the 2020 annual meeting, we announced an exciting new video project, the good news according to Jesus. Brother Anthony Morris made the following encouraging statement.

00:53:27.210 --> 00:53:36.210
Will there be challenges? Oh, yeah. Guaranteed. But if you ever want something done, that's what happens.

00:53:36.210 --> 00:53:49.210
How true those words have proven to be. Up to date, the largest feature drama audio video services had produced was a little over 100 minutes in length.

00:53:49.210 --> 00:53:55.210
The good news according to Jesus spans nearly 1000 minutes of content.

00:53:55.210 --> 00:54:06.210
We are happy to update you on this exciting project and share different ways Jehovah has helped us to overcome various challenges.

00:54:06.210 --> 00:54:14.210
Brothers and sisters already serving at the Austral Asia branch were key to helping us get the facilities ready.

00:54:14.210 --> 00:54:20.210
How did they handle this special assignment, especially during the pandemic?

00:54:21.210 --> 00:54:35.210
We were all very excited. But as the scope of this project became clear, there were times when we wondered how our small publisher base of around 68,000 would be able to fully support this large undertaking.

00:54:35.210 --> 00:54:45.210
We're a small department and it's a small branch that we're at and all of a sudden we had this project highlighted that it was three times our normal workload.

00:54:45.210 --> 00:54:54.210
Right after we received approval for the project, the branch territory experienced terrible bushfires, raging right throughout the country.

00:54:54.210 --> 00:55:00.210
Straight after this were floods. So many of our brothers experienced double disasters.

00:55:00.210 --> 00:55:07.210
As we then started to recover from this and build momentum to start the project, the COVID-19 pandemic began.

00:55:07.210 --> 00:55:17.510
All the deliveries of construction materials coming into the branch had to be quarantined. All the bulk supplies that the construction department was using.

00:55:17.510 --> 00:55:21.510
And so that meant there was a time period for those things to be unavailable for use.

00:55:21.510 --> 00:55:36.510
And then the logistics of once all those bulk supplies came out of quarantine to then move to where they're needed on the site when new deliveries are coming in and managing that safely with the COVID-19 risks and the risks of interaction with the delivery drivers and the contractors.

00:55:36.510 --> 00:55:40.510
It was complicated and very time consuming for all involved.

00:55:40.510 --> 00:55:48.510
We needed help from our brothers and sisters outside of Bethel. So we put the call out and they came from all over the branch territory to help.

00:55:48.510 --> 00:56:00.510
Many of them travelled days on rough and rugged roads to come and help us. When they arrived they spent a time in quarantine and then they were able to come and help us safely on site.

00:56:00.510 --> 00:56:08.510
There were specific items needed for the project so we asked the brothers and sisters to help to see where or how we could obtain them.

00:56:08.510 --> 00:56:24.510
It was so heartwarming to see all the responses flooding in. Within a short amount of time we had received offers for donations or loans for much of the heavy machinery or large equipment we needed and even things like plants for landscaping.

00:56:24.510 --> 00:56:38.510
So we bought in a number of temporary workers and a number of remote workers as well were added to the team and the branch committee made available a large car parking area so that we could quarantine off all the deliveries and handle those things safely and in line with the guidelines.

00:56:38.510 --> 00:56:47.510
So at the beginning of the project the number was about 200 people in the family and that quickly grew to around 500.

00:56:48.510 --> 00:56:56.510
And while we have a beautiful kitchen here to serve food from it wasn't really designed for 500 meals each day.

00:56:56.510 --> 00:57:07.510
The branch committee as well as various departments although they had a heavy workload themselves they were able to extend helping hand where we lost commuters.

00:57:07.510 --> 00:57:15.510
We gained some workers from various departments who helped us in various tasks within the food service.

00:57:15.510 --> 00:57:25.510
So it was clear to everybody in the department and at the branch that it really needed to be a team effort and everybody going above and beyond to make this work.

00:57:25.510 --> 00:57:41.510
But that only takes you so far. Jehovah's blessing on the arrangements the qualities that he helps us to show the motivation that he helps us to have to overcome those challenges and to take on things that really are beyond what we can normally cope with.

00:57:41.510 --> 00:57:49.510
And seeing that particularly as we look back on a number of those challenges and how they've been overcome you see Jehovah's involvement day to day.

00:57:49.510 --> 00:57:56.510
A brother had a trailer that was going to be donated to the project but he didn't have the funds to pay for the freight.

00:57:56.510 --> 00:58:03.510
At the very same time a sister contacted the branch and wanted to donate specifically to the project.

00:58:03.510 --> 00:58:08.510
The amount she donated was a amount that was needed to cover the freight to bring the trailer to Bethel.

00:58:09.510 --> 00:58:16.510
One brother made a 30-hour round trip to deliver a large quantity of goods he manufactured for us.

00:58:16.510 --> 00:58:24.510
He made this trip not once or twice but multiple times even planning the work around two surgeries he had to have.

00:58:24.510 --> 00:58:35.510
A number of trucks were required to freight the goods so members of his family and congregation shared in the driving while local brothers extended hospitality.

00:58:35.510 --> 00:58:49.510
I'm very impressed with the level of appreciation, the sense of gratitude that permeates the family and seeing that is a real boost for us and the real blessing.

00:58:49.510 --> 00:58:58.510
We feel very appreciative for everyone who's been able to help on this project, recognizing their personal and collective sacrifices that have been made.

00:58:59.510 --> 00:59:06.510
But those who have been able to come in and help us on the project tell us how thankful they are to have had a share in the project.

00:59:06.510 --> 00:59:11.510
Only Jehovah can create a situation like this.

00:59:11.510 --> 00:59:21.510
Jehovah always finds a way to help us do his will, often providing solutions we never thought possible.

00:59:21.510 --> 00:59:32.510
In addition to preparing the Australasia facility for the project, much work has been done with script development, casting and location scouting.

00:59:32.510 --> 00:59:35.510
How has this progressed?

00:59:35.510 --> 00:59:45.510
We recognize that there would be many needed adjustments to the branch there as far as facilities is concerned.

00:59:45.510 --> 00:59:56.510
We knew that there would be the need for many volunteers to be involved in the project and we knew it was going to be coordinated from halfway around the world.

00:59:56.510 --> 01:00:06.510
The challenge with finding locations for the Gospel accounts is that they need to look like ancient lands but be placed in a modern world.

01:00:06.510 --> 01:00:14.510
They need to have no signs of civilization and yet be close enough to civilization to support our modern filming operations.

01:00:14.510 --> 01:00:29.510
You're asked to flesh out an entire world, a culture and hundreds, actually thousands of characters that appear in these accounts to do so with very limited information actually in the Bible.

01:00:29.510 --> 01:00:41.510
How do we add enough details to connect with the audience but without overstepping by introducing teachings or ideas that contradict the Bible's message?

01:00:41.510 --> 01:00:47.510
We can truly say it was a worldwide effort on the part of our brothers and sisters.

01:00:47.510 --> 01:00:52.510
It was especially encouraging to see how young ones responded to this need.

01:00:52.510 --> 01:00:59.510
They were looking to extend themselves in their service to Jehovah and they were willing to adjust their secular jobs.

01:00:59.510 --> 01:01:06.510
They were willing to move to other locations in order to be able to support this project.

01:01:06.510 --> 01:01:13.510
We were looking at how we could accomplish so many auditions in a shorter period of time.

01:01:13.510 --> 01:01:32.510
So we came up with the idea of a self-guided audition where we put a package together identifying how the audition needs to be accomplished and we send it to the publisher that's being auditioned and they record their own audition and send it back to us for processing.

01:01:32.510 --> 01:01:44.510
While we were at some of the locations we actually did test filming. We put actors in wardrobe in front of the camera and recreated certain scenes to see how this location could be used for our project.

01:01:44.510 --> 01:01:51.510
We were able to travel to more than a dozen locations during a month and everyone returned happy and healthy.

01:01:52.510 --> 01:01:59.510
There are some accounts in the gospels that reference large groups such as the Sermon on the Mount and when Jesus preached from the boat.

01:01:59.510 --> 01:02:02.510
How would we show that many people?

01:02:02.510 --> 01:02:14.510
The team took time to test various methods including some computer graphics as well as different styles and methods to be used to duplicate people for these large crowds.

01:02:14.510 --> 01:02:25.510
The production team was able to see what did and did not work and this is very beneficial because it helps us to plan appropriately for the actual production day.

01:02:25.510 --> 01:02:38.510
And so it's simply a matter of going and doing as much research as possible to find out what is known and of course there's an entire team devoted to doing research for our publications and we have access to those brothers and sisters.

01:02:38.510 --> 01:02:58.510
Something that has been incredibly valuable for every screenwriter on this project is to see members of the teaching committee sit at every table read for each script and then proceed to give us direction, ask questions, give us direction on what to go and research further, what to remove and in many cases what to add.

01:02:58.510 --> 01:03:02.510
It shows how deeply they're invested in the story of Jesus' life.

01:03:03.510 --> 01:03:09.510
It felt like Jehovah had taken us and placed us into a land thousands of years ago.

01:03:09.510 --> 01:03:19.510
When we got to these various locations we literally would jump out of the vehicles and run across the landscape and excitement for how we could potentially use them.

01:03:19.510 --> 01:03:26.510
One of the biggest challenges we had was getting everyone back into the vehicles so that we could go on to the next location.

01:03:26.510 --> 01:03:34.510
We went to one property and when we talked with the brother he said, this isn't my property, this belongs to Jehovah.

01:03:34.510 --> 01:03:40.510
I'm holding on to it, I'm not sure why, hoping that perhaps Jehovah can use it in some way.

01:03:40.510 --> 01:03:50.510
And when you think about all of our brothers and sisters coming together to support this initiative it really has been a blessing to be able to witness that.

01:03:50.510 --> 01:03:59.510
It really reminds me of what it said in Psalm 133 verse 1 where it said it would be good to see brothers and sisters dwelling together in unity.

01:03:59.510 --> 01:04:13.510
And we've seen that goodness, we've seen our brotherhood really rally around supporting this project in so many ways and it has contributed towards a spirit that has allowed Jehovah to bless the work.

01:04:14.510 --> 01:04:22.510
Would you like to see how the design and construction aspects of the work are progressing including the historical sets?

01:04:22.510 --> 01:04:35.510
One of the biggest challenges we've had in the design construction world is to get the mentality that we're designing and building something that needs to look 2000 years old.

01:04:35.510 --> 01:04:45.510
Now we're used to building modern buildings and we're used to using the materials that we have today but to now use those to provide something that was ancient that was going to be quite the challenge.

01:04:45.510 --> 01:04:58.510
In Jesus' ministry he went to numerous different towns and those towns would have had different looks because of the natural products that were available to the tradesmen then to build those buildings.

01:04:58.510 --> 01:05:09.789
Back in ancient Israel the building materials would have been stone so they would have used limestone, basalt, field stones and even clay bricks.

01:05:09.789 --> 01:05:22.789
There's probably just over a hundred like doors and gates out there. There's also over 200 windows and we've got shutters and all of these need either timber lentils or timber seals.

01:05:23.789 --> 01:05:35.789
You have tradesmen that are used to getting things you could say nearly perfect. Normally as a renderer or a plasterer you would cover up cracks but here we're having to actually create these.

01:05:35.789 --> 01:05:39.789
That can be quite a challenge.

01:05:39.789 --> 01:05:49.789
Back a few years ago there were various branches that were put forward as possibilities as options and in the end the Austral Asia branch was chosen.

01:05:49.789 --> 01:06:15.789
At the time in the design construction world we thought well that was an interesting choice but during 2020 during the pandemic we found out in retrospect it was one of the only places on earth where this project could be completed now because of the low incidence of COVID in the country we were able to use outside contractors to come into the project to do part of the site works for us.

01:06:15.789 --> 01:06:21.789
So it's been a blessing to have the project take place at this location.

01:06:21.789 --> 01:06:34.789
Those that we had on site here already they were very open-minded and they had a lot of creative thinking when it came to building historical sets now with modern materials.

01:06:34.789 --> 01:06:51.400
We have about 7,000 square metres of render to accomplish and we'll have two teams working full time for several months to accomplish this.

01:06:51.400 --> 01:07:07.059
In this particular type of work nobody's trade really counted everybody had to try and many of our sisters in fact were the ones that had the skills that were needed to create the historical effect that was required.

01:07:07.059 --> 01:07:19.059
To achieve the weathering that would happen on the stone if it sat there for hundreds of years out in the weather the water would get into the stone and slowly break it down.

01:07:19.059 --> 01:07:36.059
So then there's going to be areas of the stone that are softer so they'll wear away quicker so then that's done with the wire brush and then some spots with the acetone it puts little divots into the stone which occur naturally in limestone.

01:07:36.059 --> 01:07:46.059
Once the project's completed in the back lot the brothers and sisters would have applied up to like four and a half thousand square metres of stone finished to the buildings.

01:07:46.059 --> 01:08:01.000
It's been amazing to see how with a variety of backgrounds despite this they've been able to achieve quite amazing things.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:10.000
It's just their willing spirit prepared to take on board the instruction and we can see Jehovah's blessing behind it.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:19.000
In the temple area in the back lot there's a little over 4,000 square metres of concrete that has been made to look like stone.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:29.000
Well one of the contractors that quoted on the job was actually a brother and that particular brother said well you know what I can volunteer to do this and there's enough brothers around that we can bring together

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:33.000
and we would be more than happy to be able to do it on a volunteer basis.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:42.000
So an isolated area was set up where these brothers could test and sample and produce the concrete that was needed for the floor finish of the temple.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:54.000
So over 27 days of straight pause we had approximately 30 brothers and sisters each day come in and work tirelessly to be able to accomplish this temple floor for us.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:09:07.000
The last day of the concrete pool we wanted to surprise the brothers because someone had made a sign saying united in spirit but actually the construction both the lights surprised us.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:20.000
They all had balloons and signs and it spelt out thank you. I think that just reflected how we love each other and we give our life for each other because we both serve the same god and we love Jehovah.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:40.000
Through lots of sleepless lights and bear prayer about it we ended up finding a brother who owned a sawmill and had property with trees on it and he willingly chopped down the trees on his property and provided them for us to deliver them to site and actually donated them to us and they were exactly what we needed.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:50.000
We also had specific prayers at certain times about certain matters and then 30 minutes later we receive answers that definitely also is no coincidence.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:10:00.000
And then obviously getting the right approvals at just at the right time despite objections we know that there's not on us other than Jehovah that could have a hand in that.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:08.000
So it's obvious that Satan has put everything he can in front of us but Jehovah has provided every time at the right time.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:16.000
It's no coincidence that he's hand has been on this and there is no doubt that he wants people to know about his son Jesus.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:40.000
Seeing the collaboration in our monthly meetings with the entire team where we have the world headquarters legal department the world headquarters computer department we have the purchasing department we have design construction we have the regional video teams we have audio video services all of these groups along with the branch in Australasia working together for a common goal as a team.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:48.340
It has been amazing and a very face strengthening experience we were happy to share this update with you.

01:10:48.340 --> 01:10:56.340
But you might still be wondering how are actors being prepared to reach our hearts through their performance.

01:10:56.340 --> 01:11:08.340
How will the tone and filming style be selected to represent the gospel accounts and maybe the biggest question you have is when will cameras start rolling?

01:11:08.340 --> 01:11:13.340
Stay tuned for a future update.

01:11:13.340 --> 01:11:19.340
Imagine the powerful impact this video series will have on people.

01:11:19.340 --> 01:11:23.340
It will help you and me follow Jesus footsteps closely.

01:11:23.340 --> 01:11:30.340
It will help us draw closer to Jehovah whom Jesus perfectly imitated as a human.

01:11:30.340 --> 01:11:34.340
But the benefits go far beyond you and me.

01:11:34.340 --> 01:11:47.340
As stated in the 2020 annual meeting it is likely this series will be used to touch the hearts and minds of billions of resurrected ones in the coming new world.

01:11:47.340 --> 01:11:55.340
Just think how this video series could help them learn about the example that Jesus set.

01:11:55.340 --> 01:12:06.340
Imagine how the visual portrayal of his warm humble and approachable personality will help them to come to know Jehovah intimately.

01:12:06.340 --> 01:12:11.340
How exactly will we use this new series to teach resurrected ones?

01:12:11.340 --> 01:12:15.340
We will have to wait and see what Jehovah directs.

01:12:16.340 --> 01:12:20.340
We are confident Jehovah is blessing this work.

01:12:20.340 --> 01:12:28.340
And we will continue to look to Jehovah for direction as we move ahead with the good news according to Jesus.

01:12:28.340 --> 01:12:52.329
Well as you likely noticed when this video production was first starting Australia was one of the countries that had the least impact from the pandemic.

01:12:53.329 --> 01:12:58.329
And so that allowed this large project to move ahead and gain momentum.

01:12:58.329 --> 01:13:07.329
Even though later the pandemic affected Australia much more seriously all of the preparations were underway.

01:13:07.329 --> 01:13:15.329
We truly thank Jehovah for the tremendous progress that has been made on this project so far.

01:13:15.329 --> 01:13:18.329
Well now we have another treat.

01:13:18.329 --> 01:13:23.329
We're going to hear from another member of the governing body brother Samuel heard.

01:13:23.329 --> 01:13:26.329
His theme is actually a quote from the Bible.

01:13:26.329 --> 01:13:28.329
Are you ready?

01:13:28.329 --> 01:13:33.329
The title is, I will never abandon you.

01:13:33.329 --> 01:13:40.789
I spoke to Jehovah just before I stepped out here.

01:13:40.789 --> 01:13:47.359
And I ask him, please, don't abandon me.

01:13:47.359 --> 01:13:51.359
If I've ever needed you, I need you now.

01:13:51.359 --> 01:14:01.359
Why? Well it's because of all of these beautiful sheep that I have the privilege to speak to for 19 minutes.

01:14:01.359 --> 01:14:07.359
So I want to make the most of these 19 minutes because sometimes we have to make adjustments.

01:14:07.359 --> 01:14:14.359
Now you may have heard of a few adjustments in our understanding of things already today.

01:14:14.359 --> 01:14:20.359
And there could be more adjustments that will have to be made later on.

01:14:20.359 --> 01:14:30.359
Now you may recall that we used to think a certain way some 10 years ago about the following matter.

01:14:30.359 --> 01:14:41.359
We felt that some of the anointed would survive Armageddon and move right on into the paradise with the other sheep.

01:14:41.359 --> 01:14:51.359
And maybe stay there for a given time and then be brought to life in heaven.

01:14:51.359 --> 01:15:03.359
But as we understand it, some things that Jehovah will not permit us to see even though we read over it many many times.

01:15:03.359 --> 01:15:09.359
We can't see it until Jehovah puts the light on it.

01:15:09.359 --> 01:15:22.359
And what I'm about to reveal to you today, Jehovah is behind it, not the governing body, not any human here on the earth, but Jehovah God.

01:15:22.359 --> 01:15:32.359
He helps us to see things. Now you may recall Matthew chapter 24 verses 29 through 31.

01:15:32.359 --> 01:15:48.359
You've read it many times, I have to, but notice what it says even though we felt a little different earlier on when we read it verse 29.

01:15:48.359 --> 01:15:59.359
Immediately after the tribulation of those days. Now remember this immediately after the tribulation of those days,

01:15:59.359 --> 01:16:09.359
the sun will be darkened and the moon will not give it slight and the stars will fall from heaven and the powers of the heavens will be shaken.

01:16:09.359 --> 01:16:20.359
Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven and all the tribes of the earth will beat themselves in grief.

01:16:21.359 --> 01:16:30.359
And they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.

01:16:30.359 --> 01:16:38.359
And he will send out his angels with a great trumpet sound, note the following.

01:16:38.359 --> 01:16:52.359
And they will gather his chosen ones together from the four winds, from one extremity of the heavens to the other extremity.

01:16:52.359 --> 01:16:55.359
Now do you see the point?

01:16:55.359 --> 01:17:08.359
We understand now that all of Christ's anointed brothers will be in heaven with him before Armageddon starts.

01:17:08.359 --> 01:17:12.359
That's the understanding that we have today.

01:17:12.359 --> 01:17:18.359
And this is exciting. We think so because of a few reasons.

01:17:18.359 --> 01:17:27.359
And here are a few, but a few of the other sheep have expressed a concern on this subject.

01:17:27.359 --> 01:17:40.359
They have said that does this new understanding mean that we will lose all the anointed Christians, including the governing body?

01:17:40.359 --> 01:17:46.359
Just when we need them the most.

01:17:46.359 --> 01:17:52.359
Will we feel abandoned in our time and need?

01:17:52.359 --> 01:17:57.359
Well, let me reassure you that you will not be abandoned.

01:17:57.359 --> 01:18:01.359
And that's what this talk is all about.

01:18:01.359 --> 01:18:11.359
You need not to think that you will be abandoned because of the anointed not being in your midst any longer.

01:18:11.359 --> 01:18:14.359
So we're going to discuss three questions.

01:18:14.359 --> 01:18:18.359
And here they are if you're writing things down.

01:18:18.359 --> 01:18:27.930
Number one, what will not happen when the last of the anointed leaves the earthly scene?

01:18:27.930 --> 01:18:36.930
And number two, how do we know that such things will not happen?

01:18:36.930 --> 01:18:39.930
What will happen?

01:18:39.930 --> 01:18:41.930
So we're going to look at these questions.

01:18:41.930 --> 01:18:44.930
First, then what will not happen?

01:18:44.930 --> 01:18:55.930
Well, I'd like to tell you very briefly, two sad stories to illustrate what will not happen.

01:18:55.930 --> 01:18:58.930
Now, here's sad story number one.

01:18:58.930 --> 01:19:01.930
Do you remember Jehovah Da?

01:19:01.930 --> 01:19:05.930
He was a faithful high priest, one of the best.

01:19:05.930 --> 01:19:09.930
When he died, he was given an unusual honor.

01:19:09.930 --> 01:19:13.930
He was buried with the kings.

01:19:13.930 --> 01:19:23.930
During his life, he protected the young king Jehoesh and helped him to be a good king who stayed faithful to Jehovah.

01:19:23.930 --> 01:19:32.930
But when old Jehovah Da died, the young king soon went bad.

01:19:32.930 --> 01:19:39.930
He listened to wicked princes and he turned away from Jehovah.

01:19:39.930 --> 01:19:44.239
That's sad story number one.

01:19:44.239 --> 01:19:49.239
On his heels, we have sad story number two.

01:19:49.239 --> 01:19:56.239
You remember that the apostle John took great joy in his spiritual children.

01:19:56.239 --> 01:19:58.239
He was a good influence on them.

01:19:58.239 --> 01:20:02.239
He helped many Christians to remain faithful.

01:20:02.239 --> 01:20:06.239
But what happened when John died?

01:20:06.239 --> 01:20:11.239
Well, he was the sole surviving apostle.

01:20:11.239 --> 01:20:15.239
The last restraint against apostasy.

01:20:15.239 --> 01:20:27.239
So after John passed off the scene, he was not long before something happened.

01:20:27.239 --> 01:20:29.239
What was it?

01:20:30.239 --> 01:20:33.239
What happened when John died?

01:20:33.239 --> 01:20:40.989
Well, the last restraint against apostasy.

01:20:40.989 --> 01:20:43.989
He was the last restraint.

01:20:43.989 --> 01:20:47.239
And now he's gone.

01:20:47.239 --> 01:20:59.239
So after John passed off the earthly scene, it was not long before apostasy spread like wildfire.

01:20:59.239 --> 01:21:08.239
And within a few decades, the Christian congregation went off into captivity in the Babylon of the Great,

01:21:08.239 --> 01:21:12.239
the world empire of false religion.

01:21:12.239 --> 01:21:18.239
Now, why mention those sad stories?

01:21:18.239 --> 01:21:25.710
Here's the reason some may wonder.

01:21:25.710 --> 01:21:40.170
In our midst today, Christian congregation, what's going to happen when all the enlightened are taken to heaven?

01:21:40.170 --> 01:21:45.170
Will the great crowd be left in the lurch?

01:21:45.170 --> 01:21:51.170
Will they stray into some kind of trouble?

01:21:51.170 --> 01:21:53.170
Maybe even apostasy?

01:21:53.170 --> 01:21:56.449
Well, what do you think?

01:21:56.449 --> 01:22:04.539
Have you heard any signs of that already?

01:22:04.539 --> 01:22:07.539
Well, here's the answer.

01:22:07.539 --> 01:22:12.539
No, they're not going to stray into apostasy.

01:22:12.539 --> 01:22:15.539
Absolutely not.

01:22:15.539 --> 01:22:22.539
Those Bible accounts actually teach us what will not happen.

01:22:22.539 --> 01:22:26.539
And that brings us to the second question.

01:22:26.539 --> 01:22:32.539
How do we know that such things will not happen?

01:22:32.539 --> 01:22:38.539
The answer has a lot to do with when we live.

01:22:38.539 --> 01:22:47.939
We do not live in ancient Israel.

01:22:47.939 --> 01:22:55.180
I don't see anyone dressed like an Israelite.

01:22:55.180 --> 01:22:59.180
None of you brothers wear skirts.

01:22:59.180 --> 01:23:03.880
No, there's nothing else.

01:23:03.880 --> 01:23:09.319
No, we didn't live in ancient Israel.

01:23:09.319 --> 01:23:12.319
Now, you may wonder, why does that matter?

01:23:12.319 --> 01:23:19.949
Because that nation was heading for trouble from its early days.

01:23:19.949 --> 01:23:23.949
In Deuteronomy, chapter 31, verse 29,

01:23:23.949 --> 01:23:31.949
Moses uttered this inspired prophecy about those rebellious people.

01:23:31.949 --> 01:23:34.949
This is what it re-hout reads.

01:23:34.949 --> 01:23:39.949
I will know that after my death, you will surely act wickedly

01:23:39.949 --> 01:23:44.949
and turn aside from the way about which I have commanded you.

01:23:44.949 --> 01:23:49.949
Now Moses' words came true many times, not just once.

01:23:49.949 --> 01:23:53.949
Finally, Jehovah had to cast off those wicked people.

01:23:53.949 --> 01:23:57.949
So when King Jehovah went bad,

01:23:57.949 --> 01:24:03.949
he was just acting like many other kings of Judah and Israel.

01:24:03.949 --> 01:24:07.949
Today things are different among God's people.

01:24:07.949 --> 01:24:12.949
Keep in mind we do not live at the end of the first century CE.

01:24:12.949 --> 01:24:15.949
Now, why does that matter?

01:24:15.949 --> 01:24:24.460
Remember, in Matthew 13, when his illustration of the wheat and the weeds,

01:24:24.460 --> 01:24:28.460
Jesus had foretold that a great apostasy would take place.

01:24:28.460 --> 01:24:33.460
In 2 Thessalonians, chapter 2, Paul confirmed that Jesus' prophecy

01:24:33.460 --> 01:24:39.460
was already beginning to come true in the first century.

01:24:39.460 --> 01:24:43.460
Peter and John verified the same in their writings.

01:24:43.460 --> 01:24:49.460
In the 2nd century CE, the Christian congregation was corrupted

01:24:49.460 --> 01:24:54.460
and went off into spiritual captivity to Babylon the Great.

01:24:55.460 --> 01:24:59.460
So Jesus' inspired prophecy was fulfilled.

01:24:59.460 --> 01:25:02.460
It came true.

01:25:02.460 --> 01:25:07.460
However today things are very different among God's people,

01:25:07.460 --> 01:25:09.460
much different.

01:25:09.460 --> 01:25:12.460
At what time are we living?

01:25:12.460 --> 01:25:15.460
Well, we said not back then.

01:25:15.460 --> 01:25:17.460
Well, you know the answer to that.

01:25:17.460 --> 01:25:23.460
We're blessed to be living in a special time period.

01:25:23.460 --> 01:25:27.460
And this began as far back as 1914.

01:25:27.460 --> 01:25:33.460
It's more than just the last days of this old system of things.

01:25:33.460 --> 01:25:38.409
Well, why is that?

01:25:38.409 --> 01:25:43.409
Notice what the Bible says, Acts chapter 3, verse 21.

01:25:43.409 --> 01:25:50.409
It says it's also called the times of restoration of all things.

01:25:51.409 --> 01:25:55.409
Now let the word restoration linger in your mind.

01:25:55.409 --> 01:25:58.409
Why does that matter?

01:25:58.409 --> 01:26:02.409
We're living in the times of restoration of all things.

01:26:02.409 --> 01:26:07.850
Because pure worship has been restored.

01:26:07.850 --> 01:26:09.850
We're bathing in it.

01:26:09.850 --> 01:26:16.850
And the worship of Jehovah will never be corrupted ever again

01:26:16.850 --> 01:26:20.850
for all eternity.

01:26:20.850 --> 01:26:27.850
Now that is something to swallow that's tasty indeed.

01:26:27.850 --> 01:26:32.850
Now let's read Isaiah 54, 17 together.

01:26:32.850 --> 01:26:37.850
Jehovah made this long range prophecy through Isaiah.

01:26:37.850 --> 01:26:40.850
Now this is what it says.

01:26:40.850 --> 01:26:43.850
No weapon formed against you will have any success

01:26:43.850 --> 01:26:46.850
and you will condemn any tongue that rises up against you

01:26:46.850 --> 01:26:48.850
in the judgment.

01:26:48.850 --> 01:26:53.850
This is the heritage of the servants of Jehovah

01:26:53.850 --> 01:26:58.850
and their righteousness is from me declared Jehovah.

01:26:58.850 --> 01:27:01.850
Now think about that, please.

01:27:01.850 --> 01:27:10.850
No weapon formed against you will have any success.

01:27:10.850 --> 01:27:15.850
The prophecy says that this is our heritage.

01:27:15.850 --> 01:27:21.850
Those inspired words are being fulfilled now today.

01:27:21.850 --> 01:27:24.850
Nothing can take that away,

01:27:24.850 --> 01:27:30.850
not even the God of this system of things Satan himself.

01:27:30.850 --> 01:27:34.850
Now remember our second question.

01:27:34.850 --> 01:27:38.850
How do we know that when the anointed are taken to heaven,

01:27:38.850 --> 01:27:42.850
the great crowd won't drift away into trouble?

01:27:43.850 --> 01:27:49.850
How do we know that they won't rebel the way Jehovah did

01:27:49.850 --> 01:27:55.850
when Jehovah died or drift off into apostasy?

01:27:55.850 --> 01:27:58.850
The way the second century Christians did after the last

01:27:58.850 --> 01:28:02.850
of the apostles died off.

01:28:02.850 --> 01:28:12.380
Well, we know it just a matter of turning the page

01:28:12.380 --> 01:28:24.180
and the answer is because we do not live in ancient Israel

01:28:24.180 --> 01:28:30.180
and we do not live in the second century CE.

01:28:30.180 --> 01:28:35.180
We live in a wonderful time of what?

01:28:35.180 --> 01:28:42.899
Restoration when Jehovah has guaranteed us

01:28:42.899 --> 01:28:47.899
that no weapon formed against us will succeed.

01:28:47.899 --> 01:28:49.899
Now our third question.

01:28:49.899 --> 01:28:54.630
What will happen when the anointed are taken to heaven?

01:28:54.630 --> 01:28:57.630
Well, try to imagine that time.

01:28:57.630 --> 01:29:01.630
Give you a second. It's over.

01:29:01.630 --> 01:29:04.630
The great tribulation is underway.

01:29:04.630 --> 01:29:06.630
Babel on the Great, the world empire,

01:29:06.630 --> 01:29:09.630
false religion is destroyed first.

01:29:09.630 --> 01:29:10.630
Think of it.

01:29:10.630 --> 01:29:14.630
Events that God's organization has prepared us

01:29:14.630 --> 01:29:21.630
for over many decades are happening before our eyes.

01:29:21.630 --> 01:29:27.630
Then come something else we have been told to expect.

01:29:27.630 --> 01:29:29.630
What's that?

01:29:29.630 --> 01:29:32.630
Sometimes during the Great Tribulation

01:29:32.630 --> 01:29:34.630
and before the War of Armageddon,

01:29:34.630 --> 01:29:39.630
the remaining ones of Christ's anointed are taken to heaven.

01:29:39.630 --> 01:29:42.630
What do you think will happen next?

01:29:42.630 --> 01:29:49.619
Will the great crowd wonder about lost and confused

01:29:49.619 --> 01:29:51.619
like sheep without a shepherd?

01:29:51.619 --> 01:29:53.619
Of course not.

01:29:53.619 --> 01:29:57.619
Remember Jesus is the shepherd.

01:29:57.619 --> 01:30:01.619
He will never fail to do his job.

01:30:01.619 --> 01:30:08.859
Keep in mind that the anointed are not the head of our organization.

01:30:08.859 --> 01:30:15.659
Jesus is.

01:30:15.659 --> 01:30:19.659
And we hope all parents today raising children

01:30:19.659 --> 01:30:22.659
will teach them that fact.

01:30:22.659 --> 01:30:25.659
With Jehovah's own son in charge,

01:30:25.659 --> 01:30:29.659
Christ followers here on earth will have nothing to fear.

01:30:29.659 --> 01:30:34.659
Of course, we do not know every detail about how Christ will lead

01:30:34.659 --> 01:30:36.659
his people at that time.

01:30:36.659 --> 01:30:42.659
But there are some Bible examples that may reassure us.

01:30:42.659 --> 01:30:46.659
For instance, when Moses died before Israel entered the Promised Land,

01:30:46.659 --> 01:30:49.659
what happened to God's people?

01:30:49.659 --> 01:30:56.420
Well, without that faithful man where they left in the Lurch,

01:30:56.420 --> 01:30:58.420
the answer is no, not at all.

01:30:58.420 --> 01:31:01.420
As long as they were Jehovah's people,

01:31:01.420 --> 01:31:04.420
Jehovah provided for them,

01:31:04.420 --> 01:31:06.420
and he provided richly for them.

01:31:06.420 --> 01:31:09.420
They had an abundance.

01:31:09.420 --> 01:31:11.420
Before Moses died,

01:31:11.420 --> 01:31:15.420
Jehovah told him to commission Joshua to lead the people.

01:31:15.420 --> 01:31:19.420
Moses had been training Joshua for decades.

01:31:19.420 --> 01:31:22.420
In addition, there were many other capable men taking the lead,

01:31:22.420 --> 01:31:26.420
chiefs of thousands, hundred, fifties, and even tens.

01:31:26.420 --> 01:31:31.670
God's people were well cared for.

01:31:31.670 --> 01:31:35.670
Thank God for Moses and Joshua.

01:31:35.670 --> 01:31:38.670
Another example is that of Elijah.

01:31:38.670 --> 01:31:43.670
He had been taking the lead and peer worship among the Israelites for decades.

01:31:43.670 --> 01:31:47.670
But the time came for Jehovah to transfer him to a different assignment

01:31:47.670 --> 01:31:50.670
down south in Judah,

01:31:50.670 --> 01:31:55.670
where faithful people in the Ten Tribe Kingdom of Israel left in the Lurch,

01:31:55.670 --> 01:31:57.670
far from it,

01:31:57.670 --> 01:32:02.670
Elijah had been training Elisha for years.

01:32:02.670 --> 01:32:05.670
Then there were also the sons of the prophets,

01:32:05.670 --> 01:32:10.670
evidently organized into schools of some kind, we don't know.

01:32:10.670 --> 01:32:16.670
So there were many faithful men helping to lead God's people.

01:32:16.670 --> 01:32:18.670
Jehovah's purpose kept advancing,

01:32:18.670 --> 01:32:20.670
and he cared for his faithful people.

01:32:20.670 --> 01:32:22.670
Now with those examples in mind,

01:32:22.670 --> 01:32:27.670
what do you think will happen when the anointed are taken to heaven?

01:32:27.670 --> 01:32:32.560
Well, we don't need to wonder.

01:32:32.560 --> 01:32:37.560
Open your Bibles and Pads and look at Hebrews 13.

01:32:37.560 --> 01:32:40.560
5B.

01:32:40.560 --> 01:32:42.560
He says, for he has said,

01:32:42.560 --> 01:32:45.560
I will never leave you and I will never abandon you.

01:32:45.560 --> 01:32:51.350
That tells us the simple reassuring truth.

01:32:51.350 --> 01:32:56.350
Jehovah will never abandon his faithful ones.

01:32:56.350 --> 01:33:00.350
Like Moses and Elijah and faithful anointed ones

01:33:00.350 --> 01:33:06.350
who take the lead today, understand the importance of training others.

01:33:06.350 --> 01:33:07.350
That's undergoing.

01:33:07.350 --> 01:33:11.350
The governing body has been training men of the other sheep to take the lead

01:33:11.350 --> 01:33:13.350
for many decades now.

01:33:13.350 --> 01:33:17.350
We're familiar with the many schools to train elders and missionaries

01:33:17.350 --> 01:33:21.350
and traveling overseers and branch personnel.

01:33:21.350 --> 01:33:25.350
In addition to that, the governing body has personally been training helpers

01:33:25.350 --> 01:33:28.350
to the various committees of the governing body.

01:33:28.350 --> 01:33:34.350
These faithful men are right now carrying a very heavy load of responsibility.

01:33:34.350 --> 01:33:38.350
Believe me, as a member of the governing body,

01:33:38.350 --> 01:33:40.350
I can say for the rest of us,

01:33:40.350 --> 01:33:45.350
we need the helpers that Jehovah has given us.

01:33:45.350 --> 01:33:48.350
We pray for them every day.

01:33:48.350 --> 01:33:52.350
And they're well prepared to continue in this work.

01:33:53.350 --> 01:33:57.350
Carrying for Christ's sheep under the direction of Jesus himself,

01:33:57.350 --> 01:33:59.350
the head of the congregation.

01:33:59.350 --> 01:34:01.350
Now, what is the point?

01:34:01.350 --> 01:34:02.350
Simply this.

01:34:02.350 --> 01:34:07.350
When the anointed are taken to heaven near the very end of the great tribulation,

01:34:07.350 --> 01:34:09.350
but before Armageddon,

01:34:09.350 --> 01:34:13.350
there will be no interruption of pure worship here on the earth.

01:34:13.350 --> 01:34:16.350
Pure worship will keep right on going.

01:34:17.350 --> 01:34:24.760
So, thank Jehovah for the leadership of Jesus Christ.

01:34:24.760 --> 01:34:32.170
None of God's worshipers in heaven are on earth will miss a beat.

01:34:32.170 --> 01:34:35.170
Yes, there will be an attack from God of may God,

01:34:35.170 --> 01:34:37.170
but it will not get very far.

01:34:37.170 --> 01:34:38.170
It's going to fail.

01:34:38.170 --> 01:34:42.170
It will not stop the great crowd from worshiping Jehovah

01:34:42.170 --> 01:34:45.170
and looking to him to rescue them.

01:34:45.170 --> 01:34:49.170
That's what a risk cure he will prove to be.

01:34:49.170 --> 01:34:51.170
Now, how we answered a third question?

01:34:51.170 --> 01:34:53.170
Well, partly.

01:34:53.170 --> 01:34:55.170
We know what will happen to the great crowd

01:34:55.170 --> 01:34:57.170
when the anointed are taken to heaven,

01:34:57.170 --> 01:35:00.170
but that may still leave us wondering.

01:35:00.170 --> 01:35:02.170
What about the anointed?

01:35:02.170 --> 01:35:09.770
What will they do after they depart the earthly scene?

01:35:09.770 --> 01:35:11.770
We want to know.

01:35:11.770 --> 01:35:19.380
Well, the Bible answers that directly.

01:35:19.380 --> 01:35:26.380
At Revelation 17, we are able to learn in verse 14

01:35:26.380 --> 01:35:28.380
that the political elements of this world

01:35:28.380 --> 01:35:31.380
will foolishly battle with the land.

01:35:31.380 --> 01:35:33.380
They will lose, of course.

01:35:33.380 --> 01:35:36.380
The verse says the land will conquer them.

01:35:36.380 --> 01:35:38.380
And who will help him?

01:35:38.380 --> 01:35:40.380
The verse continues.

01:35:40.380 --> 01:35:44.380
Also, those with him who are called and chosen and faithful

01:35:44.380 --> 01:35:45.380
will do so.

01:35:45.380 --> 01:35:48.380
Now, who are called chosen and faithful?

01:35:49.380 --> 01:35:52.380
At that time, it will be the resurrected anointed.

01:35:52.380 --> 01:35:54.380
So when the anointed are called to heaven,

01:35:54.380 --> 01:35:59.380
one of the first assignments is to fight.

01:35:59.380 --> 01:36:00.380
Yeah.

01:36:00.380 --> 01:36:05.659
Now, that's interesting.

01:36:05.659 --> 01:36:10.659
Some of us were fighters before we became through Christians.

01:36:10.659 --> 01:36:17.119
Some even served in various branches of the military.

01:36:17.119 --> 01:36:19.119
Did we do?

01:36:19.119 --> 01:36:25.340
Brother Morris.

01:36:25.340 --> 01:36:28.340
Some were green beret, not brother Morris.

01:36:28.340 --> 01:36:34.760
But then we became Christians.

01:36:34.760 --> 01:36:38.760
We learned the way of peace and we let go of such warfare.

01:36:38.760 --> 01:36:44.760
Figuratively speaking, we pulled the pin on our last hand grenade

01:36:44.760 --> 01:36:51.760
and tossed it into the air, killing no one or nothing.

01:36:51.760 --> 01:36:54.760
Just a loud caw, boom.

01:36:54.760 --> 01:36:59.260
But in heaven, we will serve along with Christ

01:36:59.260 --> 01:37:04.260
and His Holy Angel, waging the final war against God's enemies.

01:37:04.260 --> 01:37:08.260
So if you've ever thought that you might feel left in the

01:37:08.260 --> 01:37:12.260
lurch after the anointed are taken to heaven, think of this.

01:37:12.260 --> 01:37:16.260
Honor, none of us Christians are allowed to fight.

01:37:16.260 --> 01:37:19.260
Many of us anointed ones are too old to fight,

01:37:19.260 --> 01:37:23.260
even if we were allowed to.

01:37:23.260 --> 01:37:27.260
But in heaven, we will be mighty spirit creatures,

01:37:27.260 --> 01:37:31.260
fighting alongside our warrior king, Jesus Christ.

01:37:31.260 --> 01:37:39.260
Believe me, we can and will do use significant more good in heaven

01:37:39.260 --> 01:37:46.260
than we ever could as imperfect humans here on this earth.

01:37:46.260 --> 01:38:09.000
Well, I'm not done, but I should be.

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:12.000
Ask for the other sheet.

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:16.000
What will you need to do during that climatic time?

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:19.000
Simply this. Hide.

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:24.000
That's right. At Isaiah 26, 20, he wrote, inner your inner rooms.

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:27.000
And shut your door behind you.

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:33.000
Hide yourself for a brief moment until the wrath has passed by.

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
It will be hide and seek.

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:41.000
You will hide and they will seek to find you, but they will not.

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000
Do you have anything to worry about?

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:47.000
You have nothing to worry about.

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:50.000
Nothing at all.

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:55.000
Because Jehovah will never abandon you.

01:38:55.000 --> 01:39:00.000
There is no justifiable reason to worry about the future.

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:04.000
Just be there, brothers and sisters, to enjoy it.

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:09.000
Remember, Jehovah loves you and he will never abandon you.

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000
Please believe it.

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:16.000
You will not be disappointed.

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:27.720
Well, we said it would be a treat, and it was a treat.

01:39:27.720 --> 01:39:32.720
Thank you so much, Brother Heard, for helping us to realize

01:39:32.720 --> 01:39:39.720
that God's people are completely safe even as we approach the Great Tribulation and Armageddon.

01:39:39.720 --> 01:39:43.720
But now the question is, when will those events occur?

01:39:44.720 --> 01:39:47.720
Please pay close attention to Brother Anthony Morris,

01:39:47.720 --> 01:39:52.720
another member of the governing body, as he speaks to us on this subject.

01:39:52.720 --> 01:39:56.720
Why keep on the watch?

01:39:56.720 --> 01:40:02.720
So to answer the question, why keep on the watch?

01:40:02.720 --> 01:40:10.720
There is a simple direct answer, but we have a second reason as well to share during this talk.

01:40:10.720 --> 01:40:20.470
Find Mark, and we are going to read chapter 13,

01:40:20.470 --> 01:40:24.470
and it leads to our main reason why,

01:40:24.470 --> 01:40:31.470
but the context will really help us in verse 32.

01:40:31.470 --> 01:40:33.470
Let's read that.

01:40:33.470 --> 01:40:38.470
Concerning that day or the hour, nobody knows.

01:40:38.470 --> 01:40:43.470
Neither the angels in heaven, nor the sun, but the Father.

01:40:43.470 --> 01:40:49.470
Keep looking, keep awake, for you do not know when the appointed time is.

01:40:49.470 --> 01:40:55.470
It is like a man traveling abroad who left his house and gave the authority to his slaves

01:40:55.470 --> 01:41:01.470
to each one his work, and commanded the doorkeeper to keep on the watch.

01:41:01.470 --> 01:41:06.470
Keep on the watch, therefore, for you do not know

01:41:06.470 --> 01:41:11.470
when the master of the house is coming, whether late in the day,

01:41:11.470 --> 01:41:15.470
or at midnight, or at dawn, or early in the morning,

01:41:15.470 --> 01:41:23.470
in order that when he comes, suddenly, he does not find you sleeping.

01:41:23.470 --> 01:41:32.470
Now, that's our Lord and Master, very direct, compassionate, true, but direct.

01:41:32.470 --> 01:41:37.470
And then, the main reason why, verse 37,

01:41:37.470 --> 01:41:41.470
what I say to you, I say to all.

01:41:41.470 --> 01:41:46.470
So it's being repeated to all of us listening.

01:41:46.470 --> 01:41:49.470
Keep on the watch.

01:41:49.470 --> 01:41:52.470
Very simple, very direct.

01:41:52.470 --> 01:41:55.470
That's what is expected.

01:41:55.470 --> 01:41:59.470
However, and I appreciated it, it hadn't heard,

01:41:59.470 --> 01:42:04.470
or the cooks talk, who about the details and such,

01:42:04.470 --> 01:42:10.470
but in the emphasize for all of us, and it's connected here with Jehovah,

01:42:10.470 --> 01:42:13.470
a God of comfort.

01:42:13.470 --> 01:42:20.470
So while it's true, we want to address directly sometimes the things that Jesus has taught us,

01:42:20.470 --> 01:42:26.470
it doesn't mean that Jehovah is no longer a God of comfort.

01:42:26.470 --> 01:42:29.470
He wants to comfort us.

01:42:29.470 --> 01:42:33.470
So this is the second reason, and if you'll find Isaiah,

01:42:33.470 --> 01:42:38.470
and we're going to read in chapter 48,

01:42:38.470 --> 01:42:45.470
and it's a very fine thought about why, keep on the watch.

01:42:45.470 --> 01:42:50.470
Verse 17, very familiar to us, and you'll see the point.

01:42:50.470 --> 01:42:52.470
This is what Jehovah says.

01:42:52.470 --> 01:42:56.470
Your repurchaser, the Holy One of Israel,

01:42:56.470 --> 01:43:00.470
I Jehovah, am your God,

01:43:00.470 --> 01:43:04.470
the one teaching you to benefit yourself,

01:43:04.470 --> 01:43:09.470
the one guiding you in the way you should walk.

01:43:09.470 --> 01:43:18.470
Now, how we appreciate the footnote that adds depth to what Jehovah's saying here,

01:43:18.470 --> 01:43:22.470
or for your own good.

01:43:22.470 --> 01:43:24.470
Isn't that priceless?

01:43:24.470 --> 01:43:27.470
Why keep on the watch?

01:43:27.470 --> 01:43:31.010
It's for our own good.

01:43:31.010 --> 01:43:33.010
It really is.

01:43:33.010 --> 01:43:39.010
See, and that's the point Jesus and Jehovah wants us to take away.

01:43:39.010 --> 01:43:42.010
We're trying to address that with this talk,

01:43:42.010 --> 01:43:48.010
because some of you have been serving Jehovah for a long time,

01:43:48.010 --> 01:43:53.010
and I'm not going to stare at anybody, because I know different ones.

01:43:53.010 --> 01:44:01.739
And it's just amazing how Jehovah has been there for you all these years.

01:44:01.739 --> 01:44:03.739
But you're only human,

01:44:03.739 --> 01:44:07.739
and we'll address some concerns and some reason.

01:44:07.739 --> 01:44:10.739
Just wanted to have you think about this here,

01:44:10.739 --> 01:44:14.739
personal experience many years ago,

01:44:14.739 --> 01:44:17.739
my son's just in Paul.

01:44:17.739 --> 01:44:23.739
We're in the early years of school, elementary school.

01:44:23.739 --> 01:44:27.739
And back at the time, I haven't heard it a lot lately,

01:44:27.739 --> 01:44:31.739
but from time to time, this would come up at a social gathering.

01:44:31.739 --> 01:44:36.739
The mind is there, second grade, first grade,

01:44:36.739 --> 01:44:40.739
but these boys were thinkers.

01:44:40.739 --> 01:44:44.739
So they'd listen, and they appreciated all these older ones,

01:44:44.739 --> 01:44:47.739
and they had a number of them in Rhode Island,

01:44:47.739 --> 01:44:50.739
long time servants of Jehovah God.

01:44:50.739 --> 01:44:53.739
However, from time to time, this statement,

01:44:53.739 --> 01:44:56.739
and they'd be looking at my sons,

01:44:56.739 --> 01:45:01.739
and oh, you'll never graduate in this system?

01:45:01.739 --> 01:45:04.739
Not going to happen.

01:45:04.739 --> 01:45:06.739
So, you know, I'm at their house.

01:45:06.739 --> 01:45:09.739
They just fed us.

01:45:09.739 --> 01:45:11.739
Lord, help me.

01:45:11.739 --> 01:45:13.739
What am I going to do here?

01:45:13.739 --> 01:45:16.739
I'll come out from time to time,

01:45:16.739 --> 01:45:19.739
at least during those years,

01:45:19.739 --> 01:45:22.739
and maybe it was post 1975, I don't know.

01:45:22.739 --> 01:45:25.739
But they'd make the statements,

01:45:25.739 --> 01:45:28.739
and I'm going to give you a big confession

01:45:28.739 --> 01:45:31.739
because, you know, this one comes clear to mind,

01:45:31.739 --> 01:45:34.739
driving back from the gathering,

01:45:34.739 --> 01:45:38.739
just in Paul, or, you know, thinking in their trouble.

01:45:38.739 --> 01:45:40.739
They're puzzled.

01:45:40.739 --> 01:45:41.739
What is this about?

01:45:41.739 --> 01:45:43.739
What are we going to do?

01:45:43.739 --> 01:45:45.739
And they're thinking of things in the future.

01:45:45.739 --> 01:45:50.739
For them is growing in their love for Jehovah.

01:45:50.739 --> 01:45:53.739
You know, is that true, Dad?

01:45:53.739 --> 01:45:55.739
And so I'd say, look, you know,

01:45:55.739 --> 01:45:57.739
let me tie these people, saying these things

01:45:57.739 --> 01:45:59.739
are long time servants.

01:45:59.739 --> 01:46:01.739
Experience people.

01:46:01.739 --> 01:46:03.739
If any of you are guilty, God loves you.

01:46:03.739 --> 01:46:05.739
He forgives you.

01:46:05.739 --> 01:46:07.739
If you did that back then.

01:46:07.739 --> 01:46:10.739
You didn't help anybody.

01:46:10.739 --> 01:46:13.739
But I'm going to give you a big confession.

01:46:13.739 --> 01:46:15.739
So that one particular night,

01:46:15.739 --> 01:46:16.739
we're driving back,

01:46:16.739 --> 01:46:19.739
it was a little distance from where we were.

01:46:19.739 --> 01:46:21.739
And they brought that up.

01:46:21.739 --> 01:46:22.739
They're sitting in the back seat,

01:46:22.739 --> 01:46:24.739
so we're having this conversation.

01:46:24.739 --> 01:46:26.739
And I told them, I said, look,

01:46:26.739 --> 01:46:29.739
you boys, remember,

01:46:29.739 --> 01:46:32.739
you got to keep on the watch.

01:46:32.739 --> 01:46:35.979
This thing could go on,

01:46:35.979 --> 01:46:39.979
and be ready for it to go to 2020.

01:46:40.979 --> 01:46:42.979
Honest.

01:46:42.979 --> 01:46:45.979
I mean, we're talking almost 40 years.

01:46:45.979 --> 01:46:47.979
Almost 40 years.

01:46:47.979 --> 01:46:53.489
I felt pretty safe with that.

01:46:53.489 --> 01:46:56.489
But you know what year this is?

01:46:56.489 --> 01:46:59.489
What are you going to do?

01:46:59.489 --> 01:47:02.489
But at least I'm happy to say they,

01:47:02.489 --> 01:47:06.489
and my wife and their wives,

01:47:06.489 --> 01:47:09.489
we're all still keeping on the watch.

01:47:10.489 --> 01:47:15.489
And continue to plan to keep on the watch.

01:47:15.489 --> 01:47:21.489
Now, just something to address the feelings that some have.

01:47:21.489 --> 01:47:24.489
And these are beautiful friends,

01:47:24.489 --> 01:47:29.489
different ones worship in Jehovah for many decades.

01:47:29.489 --> 01:47:32.489
And we're only human.

01:47:32.489 --> 01:47:34.489
You know, it's the truth,

01:47:34.489 --> 01:47:37.489
but we're only human.

01:47:37.489 --> 01:47:42.489
So one brother wrote and appreciated his sincerity.

01:47:42.489 --> 01:47:44.489
And he said,

01:47:44.489 --> 01:47:47.489
during the annual meeting of 2019,

01:47:47.489 --> 01:47:51.489
the Ramapo project was announced.

01:47:51.489 --> 01:47:53.489
And if I remember right,

01:47:53.489 --> 01:47:55.489
it was stated that the project

01:47:55.489 --> 01:47:59.489
would be complete in a few years.

01:47:59.489 --> 01:48:02.489
With recent watchtower articles telling us that

01:48:02.489 --> 01:48:06.489
we are in the last of the last days,

01:48:06.489 --> 01:48:10.489
beautiful expression, but words are powerful.

01:48:10.489 --> 01:48:13.489
It seemed a little disappointing

01:48:13.489 --> 01:48:18.489
that this may push Armageddon off a few years.

01:48:18.489 --> 01:48:22.489
This was his sincere concern, really.

01:48:22.489 --> 01:48:25.489
And you know he's not alone.

01:48:25.489 --> 01:48:28.739
They're only human.

01:48:28.739 --> 01:48:30.739
Well, how should we respond?

01:48:30.739 --> 01:48:33.739
Brother writes that in.

01:48:33.739 --> 01:48:38.739
Well, remember Jehovah is a God of comfort.

01:48:38.739 --> 01:48:40.739
We want to go direct.

01:48:40.739 --> 01:48:43.739
It's what we addressed there with what Jesus told us.

01:48:43.739 --> 01:48:48.739
But how can we comfort him too?

01:48:48.739 --> 01:48:52.739
Rather bring the truth as it is and be straight with it.

01:48:52.739 --> 01:48:58.739
But the governing body wants all of you to know,

01:48:58.739 --> 01:49:01.739
including those that will see it later,

01:49:01.739 --> 01:49:06.739
that we are determined to remain active

01:49:06.739 --> 01:49:12.739
and to faithfully deliver spiritual food at the right time.

01:49:12.739 --> 01:49:17.739
We are also looking beyond the last days.

01:49:17.739 --> 01:49:20.739
You're getting that message.

01:49:20.739 --> 01:49:23.739
Let me expound on that thought.

01:49:23.739 --> 01:49:26.739
Looking beyond the last days.

01:49:26.739 --> 01:49:30.739
And this is a quote from the proclaimer's book.

01:49:30.739 --> 01:49:33.739
And I treasured it when the book came out.

01:49:33.739 --> 01:49:36.739
And a lot of work went into that publication.

01:49:36.739 --> 01:49:39.739
But there, referring to God's people,

01:49:39.739 --> 01:49:42.739
it stated, you know,

01:49:42.739 --> 01:49:46.739
there's a lot of international construction going on at the time too,

01:49:46.739 --> 01:49:49.739
if you were in the truth then, quoting it now,

01:49:49.739 --> 01:49:52.739
with the help of Jehovah's Spirit,

01:49:52.739 --> 01:49:57.739
they and God's people want to give the greatest witness possible

01:49:57.739 --> 01:50:00.739
during the time that remains before Armageddon.

01:50:00.739 --> 01:50:06.739
They are convinced that God's new world is very close at hand.

01:50:06.739 --> 01:50:10.739
And they have faith that they will survive

01:50:10.739 --> 01:50:14.739
as an organized people into the new world,

01:50:14.739 --> 01:50:18.739
under the rule of God's Messianic Kingdom.

01:50:18.739 --> 01:50:24.720
Now, please note the rest of this quote.

01:50:24.720 --> 01:50:27.720
It is also their hope that perhaps,

01:50:28.720 --> 01:50:33.720
keyword, many of the fine facilities that they have built

01:50:33.720 --> 01:50:39.720
and dedicated to Jehovah will continue to be used after Armageddon

01:50:39.720 --> 01:50:43.720
as centers from which knowledge of the only true God

01:50:43.720 --> 01:50:47.720
can be diffused until it truly fills the earth.

01:50:47.720 --> 01:50:50.720
End quote. Beautiful thought.

01:50:50.720 --> 01:50:52.720
Right there.

01:50:52.720 --> 01:50:54.720
Still valid.

01:50:55.720 --> 01:50:59.720
In harmony with what the faithful slave said then,

01:50:59.720 --> 01:51:04.720
the faithful slave now says many of the projects

01:51:04.720 --> 01:51:09.720
that are being worked on now like Ramaphob and the Good News,

01:51:09.720 --> 01:51:12.720
according to Jesus' video series,

01:51:12.720 --> 01:51:20.260
may or perhaps will carry over into the new world

01:51:20.260 --> 01:51:25.260
to assist the great crowd with the work ahead

01:51:25.260 --> 01:51:30.260
and perhaps, including resurrected ones.

01:51:30.260 --> 01:51:32.260
That's comforting.

01:51:32.260 --> 01:51:37.260
That's just, you have to let that sink in.

01:51:37.260 --> 01:51:41.260
Now, we want to conclude with expressions

01:51:41.260 --> 01:51:44.260
from two friends of mine,

01:51:44.260 --> 01:51:49.260
a long time, hardworking supporters of the faithful slave

01:51:49.260 --> 01:51:51.260
for decades.

01:51:51.260 --> 01:51:54.260
I love these men and we're keeping anonymous

01:51:54.260 --> 01:51:59.260
but I ask them to write their personal feelings

01:51:59.260 --> 01:52:04.260
as they've been supporting the slave for all these decades.

01:52:04.260 --> 01:52:11.260
How have they benefited from keeping on the watch?

01:52:11.260 --> 01:52:16.699
So here's what the first one said.

01:52:16.699 --> 01:52:20.699
I come from a long line of people who believed in keeping

01:52:20.699 --> 01:52:23.699
an expectation of the end.

01:52:23.699 --> 01:52:28.699
My mother died just last year and she always felt

01:52:28.699 --> 01:52:31.699
that the end was closer to hand.

01:52:31.699 --> 01:52:35.699
She just knew that she would live to see it,

01:52:35.699 --> 01:52:38.699
but she didn't.

01:52:38.699 --> 01:52:41.699
She had first learned the truth from her mother-in-law,

01:52:41.699 --> 01:52:44.699
my grandmother, an anointed Christian who often told me

01:52:44.699 --> 01:52:48.699
that she hoped to see the income in her lifetime.

01:52:48.699 --> 01:52:50.699
She didn't.

01:52:50.699 --> 01:52:53.699
She had learned the truth from her mother who died

01:52:53.699 --> 01:52:56.699
when I was a teenager and firmly believed

01:52:56.699 --> 01:52:59.699
she would see the end in her lifetime.

01:52:59.699 --> 01:53:01.699
She didn't.

01:53:01.699 --> 01:53:03.699
And she, my great grandmother,

01:53:03.699 --> 01:53:05.699
had learned the truth from her mother-in-law

01:53:05.699 --> 01:53:08.699
who died long before I was born

01:53:08.699 --> 01:53:11.699
and surely felt the same way about seeing the end.

01:53:11.699 --> 01:53:14.699
She didn't.

01:53:14.699 --> 01:53:18.699
And here I am now in my seventh decade of life,

01:53:18.699 --> 01:53:22.699
firmly believing that I will see the end very soon.

01:53:22.699 --> 01:53:26.939
So what does that mean?

01:53:26.939 --> 01:53:33.699
That I'm just another one in a long line of delusional people?

01:53:33.699 --> 01:53:35.699
I don't think so.

01:53:35.699 --> 01:53:37.699
For two reasons.

01:53:37.699 --> 01:53:41.699
One, the evidence that the end is near keeps growing.

01:53:41.699 --> 01:53:45.699
I've seen signs of the end that even my mother never saw,

01:53:45.699 --> 01:53:48.699
such as the recent pandemic.

01:53:48.699 --> 01:53:52.699
Sometimes I compare myself to a man living in Judea

01:53:52.699 --> 01:53:55.699
around the year 608 BCE.

01:53:55.699 --> 01:53:58.699
Such a man might have come from a long line

01:53:58.699 --> 01:54:01.699
of faithful people who had listened to the prophets

01:54:01.699 --> 01:54:04.699
and thought that the end was near

01:54:04.699 --> 01:54:09.699
over a century earlier hearing these things.

01:54:09.699 --> 01:54:13.699
Maybe his great grandparents might have heard Isaiah speak,

01:54:13.699 --> 01:54:17.699
leading them to conclude that Jerusalem's end was near.

01:54:17.699 --> 01:54:24.500
Should that man decide that his family had been deluded?

01:54:24.500 --> 01:54:28.500
Just because they hadn't seen the destruction of Jerusalem?

01:54:28.500 --> 01:54:30.500
No.

01:54:30.500 --> 01:54:34.500
Jerusalem was destroyed in 607.

01:54:34.500 --> 01:54:39.500
So he's living in 608 having these concerns.

01:54:39.500 --> 01:54:43.500
Months later, it happens.

01:54:43.500 --> 01:54:46.500
But more importantly, that man would know

01:54:46.500 --> 01:54:50.500
that his faithful family were good people who lived good lives.

01:54:50.500 --> 01:54:56.500
They loved Jehovah and they saw the truth of Isaiah's words.

01:54:56.500 --> 01:55:00.500
God teaches us to benefit ourselves.

01:55:00.500 --> 01:55:04.500
And that's the second reason why I don't feel

01:55:04.500 --> 01:55:08.500
that I've been deluded or that my faithful family members have been.

01:55:08.500 --> 01:55:13.500
Each one who served Jehovah led a good, productive, useful life.

01:55:14.500 --> 01:55:17.500
They were not just sitting around waiting for the end.

01:55:17.500 --> 01:55:19.500
They always had projects that kept them busy

01:55:19.500 --> 01:55:21.500
in Jehovah's service,

01:55:21.500 --> 01:55:25.500
goals in personal study and preaching and helping others.

01:55:25.500 --> 01:55:28.500
So they were full of purpose and joy.

01:55:28.500 --> 01:55:31.500
I want the same kind of life.

01:55:31.500 --> 01:55:34.500
Also, I can hardly wait to tell my mother.

01:55:34.500 --> 01:55:36.500
It's touching.

01:55:36.500 --> 01:55:41.500
Just how close the end was when she finally closed her eyes.

01:55:42.500 --> 01:55:47.500
I know she will want to hear all about it.

01:55:47.500 --> 01:55:50.500
It's a very touching.

01:55:50.500 --> 01:55:54.500
And the second brother of him about how keeping on the watch

01:55:54.500 --> 01:55:56.500
has benefited him.

01:55:56.500 --> 01:55:59.500
My mom raised my brother me in the truth.

01:55:59.500 --> 01:56:02.500
She often expressed to us her confidence

01:56:02.500 --> 01:56:06.500
that the end is just around the corner.

01:56:06.500 --> 01:56:09.500
She didn't just say it, she lived it.

01:56:09.500 --> 01:56:12.500
She devoted herself to the ministry

01:56:12.500 --> 01:56:14.500
so that she could help others to serve Jehovah

01:56:14.500 --> 01:56:17.500
while there is still time.

01:56:17.500 --> 01:56:20.500
She kept an expectation of the end

01:56:20.500 --> 01:56:25.500
doing so year after year until she died.

01:56:25.500 --> 01:56:29.500
Now I'm approaching the age of my mother when she died.

01:56:29.500 --> 01:56:33.500
I've been keeping on the watch for over 50 years now.

01:56:33.500 --> 01:56:36.500
Am I bitter because the end has not yet come?

01:56:36.500 --> 01:56:39.500
No, not at all.

01:56:39.500 --> 01:56:41.500
How could I be?

01:56:41.500 --> 01:56:44.500
I've lived a full and satisfying life

01:56:44.500 --> 01:56:47.500
by living according to Jehovah's standards.

01:56:47.500 --> 01:56:51.500
Why would I want to live any other way?

01:56:51.500 --> 01:56:53.500
What has helped me to keep positive

01:56:53.500 --> 01:56:55.500
while waiting for the end to come?

01:56:55.500 --> 01:56:58.500
From time to time, I reflect on these few things

01:56:58.500 --> 01:56:59.500
and here they are.

01:56:59.500 --> 01:57:04.500
My dedication is unconditional and unending.

01:57:04.500 --> 01:57:07.500
I did not dedicate myself to Jehovah

01:57:07.500 --> 01:57:11.500
on the condition that he brings the end within my lifetime

01:57:11.500 --> 01:57:15.500
or even on the condition that he gives me a reward.

01:57:15.500 --> 01:57:19.500
I dedicated myself to him forever.

01:57:19.500 --> 01:57:23.500
And next, I must keep the big picture in mind.

01:57:23.500 --> 01:57:27.500
I don't want to make the mistake of focusing only on

01:57:27.500 --> 01:57:30.500
what the end will mean for me.

01:57:31.500 --> 01:57:35.500
The prospect of surviving into the new world.

01:57:35.500 --> 01:57:39.500
Rather, I must focus on something far more important

01:57:39.500 --> 01:57:42.500
what the end will mean for Jehovah,

01:57:42.500 --> 01:57:45.500
the sanctification of his name.

01:57:45.500 --> 01:57:48.500
Knowing how important that is to him,

01:57:48.500 --> 01:57:54.500
I can be sure that it will happen in his due time.

01:57:54.500 --> 01:57:56.500
And then finally,

01:57:56.500 --> 01:57:59.500
meanwhile, I must endure to the end.

01:57:59.500 --> 01:58:02.500
That means to the end of this system

01:58:02.500 --> 01:58:04.500
or the end of my life,

01:58:04.500 --> 01:58:06.500
whichever comes first.

01:58:06.500 --> 01:58:11.500
Either way, the older I get, the closer I am to the end.

01:58:11.500 --> 01:58:15.500
What if like my mom, I don't live to see it?

01:58:15.500 --> 01:58:18.500
No worries.

01:58:18.500 --> 01:58:22.500
The moment I close my eyes in death,

01:58:22.500 --> 01:58:27.500
my next conscious thought will be opening my eyes

01:58:27.500 --> 01:58:29.500
in the new world.

01:58:29.500 --> 01:58:32.500
Then it really won't matter

01:58:32.500 --> 01:58:36.500
whether I live to see the end or not.

01:58:36.500 --> 01:58:42.500
Beautiful expressions of two beautiful spiritual men.

01:58:42.500 --> 01:58:46.500
So the question to conclude,

01:58:46.500 --> 01:58:51.500
will this be the last annual meeting

01:58:51.500 --> 01:58:56.189
before the Great Tribulation?

01:58:56.189 --> 01:58:59.189
Nobody raised their hand.

01:58:59.189 --> 01:59:02.500
We don't know.

01:59:02.500 --> 01:59:05.500
But what we do know is that

01:59:05.500 --> 01:59:12.500
Jehovah and Jesus want us to keep on the watch

01:59:12.500 --> 01:59:16.500
and it's for our own good to do so.

01:59:16.500 --> 01:59:25.510
Thank you so much, Brother Morris,

01:59:25.510 --> 01:59:29.510
for that very stirring, very encouraging talk.

01:59:29.510 --> 01:59:31.510
Well, would you agree, brothers and sisters,

01:59:31.510 --> 01:59:33.510
that we have not been disappointed

01:59:33.510 --> 01:59:35.510
with our banquet of spiritual food today?

01:59:35.510 --> 01:59:37.510
How do you feel?

01:59:37.510 --> 01:59:49.260
We began our program by being reminded that Jehovah,

01:59:49.260 --> 01:59:51.260
by means of the faithful and discreet slave,

01:59:51.260 --> 01:59:56.260
is providing what we need exactly at the right time.

01:59:56.260 --> 02:00:01.260
And what an abundance of spiritual food we have.

02:00:01.260 --> 02:00:04.260
Just think of the variety that we discussed

02:00:04.260 --> 02:00:06.260
in our annual meeting today.

02:00:06.260 --> 02:00:08.260
Our new publication,

02:00:08.260 --> 02:00:10.260
Enjoy Life Forever,

02:00:10.260 --> 02:00:14.260
a brand new Caleb and Sophia epic video.

02:00:14.260 --> 02:00:16.260
The wonderful scriptural talks,

02:00:16.260 --> 02:00:20.260
the direction that we received regarding the COVID pandemic,

02:00:20.260 --> 02:00:24.260
the good news according to Jesus' video project,

02:00:24.260 --> 02:00:28.260
as well as the wonderful upbuilding spiritual songs.

02:00:28.260 --> 02:00:32.260
And that's just a fraction of the spiritual food

02:00:32.260 --> 02:00:34.260
that we're receiving at this time.

02:00:34.260 --> 02:00:38.260
Certainly, Jehovah, by means of the faithful and discreet slave,

02:00:38.260 --> 02:00:44.260
keeps giving all these forms of spiritual food

02:00:44.260 --> 02:00:46.260
just at the right time.

02:00:46.260 --> 02:00:52.260
Well, the events of the past two years have been historic,

02:00:52.260 --> 02:00:57.260
and they truly have been unprecedented.

02:00:57.260 --> 02:01:00.260
They indicate that we are close

02:01:00.260 --> 02:01:03.260
to the outbreak of the Great Tribulation.

02:01:03.260 --> 02:01:05.260
How vital it is, brothers,

02:01:05.260 --> 02:01:09.260
that we continue to recognize Jehovah's Channel

02:01:09.260 --> 02:01:13.260
for receiving spiritual food.

02:01:13.260 --> 02:01:19.260
The November 15, 2013 issue of the watchtower

02:01:19.260 --> 02:01:23.260
mentioned key points for elders in particular to keep in mind

02:01:23.260 --> 02:01:27.260
as we prepare to face the attack

02:01:27.260 --> 02:01:29.260
of that coalition of nations

02:01:29.260 --> 02:01:33.260
that the Bible calls Gog of May Gog.

02:01:33.260 --> 02:01:35.260
Now, I'm going to quote the article.

02:01:35.260 --> 02:01:37.260
This is what it stated. This is, quote,

02:01:37.260 --> 02:01:39.260
at that time,

02:01:39.260 --> 02:01:44.260
life-saving direction that we received from Jehovah's organization

02:01:44.260 --> 02:01:49.260
may not appear practical from a human standpoint.

02:01:49.260 --> 02:01:55.260
All of us must be ready to obey any instructions we may receive,

02:01:55.260 --> 02:01:59.260
whether these appear sound from a strategic

02:01:59.260 --> 02:02:03.260
or human standpoint or not.

02:02:03.260 --> 02:02:07.260
Now is the time for any who may be putting their trust

02:02:07.260 --> 02:02:11.260
in secular education,

02:02:11.260 --> 02:02:15.260
material things, or human institutions

02:02:15.260 --> 02:02:19.260
to adjust their thinking.

02:02:19.260 --> 02:02:23.260
Very sober words that apply so well

02:02:23.260 --> 02:02:27.260
at this particular moment.

02:02:27.260 --> 02:02:29.260
So, dear brothers and sisters,

02:02:29.260 --> 02:02:31.260
do you know what time it is?

02:02:31.260 --> 02:02:33.260
There has never been a more important time

02:02:33.260 --> 02:02:37.260
to stay alert spiritually

02:02:37.260 --> 02:02:41.260
and to respond quickly to Jehovah's direction.

02:02:41.260 --> 02:02:45.260
Jehovah has led us safely to this moment.

02:02:45.260 --> 02:02:49.260
He has given us everything that we need

02:02:49.260 --> 02:02:51.260
and we know he's going to continue to do so.

02:02:51.260 --> 02:02:57.260
Just as our 2022 year text found at Psalm 34, 10 states,

02:02:57.260 --> 02:03:03.260
those seeking Jehovah will lack nothing good.

02:03:03.260 --> 02:03:05.260
So, dear brothers and sisters,

02:03:05.260 --> 02:03:11.260
be determined to continue to follow our leader, Jesus Christ,

02:03:11.260 --> 02:03:15.260
and the channel that he is using today.

02:03:15.260 --> 02:03:17.260
Because if we do,

02:03:17.260 --> 02:03:20.260
we will have everything that we need

02:03:20.260 --> 02:03:30.300
and right on time.

02:03:30.300 --> 02:03:33.300
Well, with that, we conclude another spiritual feast

02:03:33.300 --> 02:03:35.300
in conjunction with the annual meeting

02:03:35.300 --> 02:03:39.300
of the Watchtower Bible and Track Society of Pennsylvania.

02:03:39.300 --> 02:03:42.300
Wasn't that a powerful program?

02:03:42.300 --> 02:03:46.300
And how reassuring to review the many ways

02:03:46.300 --> 02:03:50.300
Jehovah has strengthened us, energized us,

02:03:50.300 --> 02:03:53.300
and comforted us over the last year?

02:03:53.300 --> 02:03:56.300
This annual meeting left us with no doubt

02:03:56.300 --> 02:03:59.300
that despite the challenges our brothers and sisters

02:03:59.300 --> 02:04:04.300
have had to endure in the face of persecution, natural disasters,

02:04:04.300 --> 02:04:08.300
and the ongoing effects of the pandemic.

02:04:08.300 --> 02:04:12.300
Jehovah continues to bless his people.

02:04:12.300 --> 02:04:17.300
His organization is on the move as never before.

02:04:17.300 --> 02:04:21.300
Let's conclude our program with a video postcard

02:04:21.300 --> 02:04:26.300
that takes us to the beautiful island nation of Jamaica.

02:04:26.300 --> 02:04:31.300
Jamaica is the third largest island in the Caribbean Sea,

02:04:31.300 --> 02:04:37.300
located about 100 miles or 160 kilometers west of Haiti.

02:04:37.300 --> 02:04:41.300
The golden beaches and beautiful coral reefs

02:04:41.300 --> 02:04:46.300
that ring the island draw more than four million visitors each year.

02:04:46.300 --> 02:04:51.300
The country's main crops include bananas, sugar cane,

02:04:51.300 --> 02:04:55.300
and world-famous Jamaican blue mountain coffee,

02:04:55.300 --> 02:05:00.300
which has grown high on the steep slopes of the blue mountains.

02:05:00.300 --> 02:05:03.300
Jamaica is also known for its jerk cuisine,

02:05:03.300 --> 02:05:08.300
which features meats such as chicken, pork, or goat,

02:05:08.300 --> 02:05:11.300
rubbed with spices, and cooked over a fire

02:05:11.300 --> 02:05:15.300
to give the meat a distinctive smoky flavor.

02:05:15.300 --> 02:05:20.300
The good news first reached Jamaica in 1897.

02:05:20.300 --> 02:05:27.300
Brother Russell even gave a talk in the capital city of Kingston back in 1913.

02:05:27.300 --> 02:05:33.300
Today, there are more than 11,360 publishers preaching

02:05:33.300 --> 02:05:38.300
in more than 165 congregations and groups.

02:05:38.300 --> 02:05:42.300
The national language of Jamaica is English,

02:05:42.300 --> 02:05:45.300
but two remote translation offices

02:05:45.300 --> 02:05:51.300
help support the preaching in Jamaican Creole and Jamaican Sign Language.

02:05:51.300 --> 02:05:55.300
During the pandemic, when it became necessary to hold meetings

02:05:55.300 --> 02:05:59.300
by video conference, our Jamaican brothers

02:05:59.300 --> 02:06:02.300
had to deal with a special challenge,

02:06:02.300 --> 02:06:06.300
the high price of internet access.

02:06:06.300 --> 02:06:09.300
The cost of data to connect to just one meeting

02:06:09.300 --> 02:06:14.300
was twice the price of taking a taxi to the Kingdom Hall.

02:06:14.300 --> 02:06:18.300
So it was far more expensive to attend a meeting virtually

02:06:18.300 --> 02:06:20.300
than it was to attend in person.

02:06:20.300 --> 02:06:24.300
Our Jamaican brothers and sisters generously have been sharing

02:06:24.300 --> 02:06:29.300
their electronic devices and helping one another with the cost of data

02:06:29.300 --> 02:06:35.300
so that everyone can access the meetings and enjoy good association.

02:06:35.300 --> 02:06:38.300
Some who benefited from these provisions

02:06:38.300 --> 02:06:43.300
are in the central sign language congregation in Mandaville.

02:06:43.300 --> 02:06:47.300
The congregation has been able to meet together by video conferencing

02:06:47.300 --> 02:06:52.300
with two other Jamaicans sign language groups providing deaf publishers

02:06:52.300 --> 02:06:58.300
on the island with more opportunities for association during the pandemic.

02:06:58.300 --> 02:07:02.300
The hard-working publishers in the central sign language congregation

02:07:02.300 --> 02:07:06.300
send you their love and greetings.

02:07:06.300 --> 02:07:09.300
And please remember dear brothers and sisters

02:07:09.300 --> 02:07:12.300
that we love you all very much.

02:07:12.300 --> 02:07:15.300
From the World Headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses,

02:07:15.300 --> 02:07:18.300
this is J.W. Broadcasting.
