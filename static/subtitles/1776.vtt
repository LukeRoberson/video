WEBVTT

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:10.310
I was born to Christian parents.

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:15.310
They always tried to instill in us a love for Jehovah,

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:22.309
but I felt quite lonely growing up, and I felt like I didn't have people who wanted to do the same things.

00:00:22.309 --> 00:00:26.309
The lifestyle, the way they spoke, the music they were listening to,

00:00:26.309 --> 00:00:30.309
and so for me, the real struggle was, where do I stand?

00:00:30.309 --> 00:00:32.310
Where are my boundaries going to be set?

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:37.310
It's really hard, because it could be the difference between having a friend and not having a friend.

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:43.310
Over the years, I've talked to several who perhaps drifted a little bit in the truth,

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:47.310
and that unfortunately happened to some of my friends.

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:50.310
Nobody is immune to the pressures of the world.

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:54.310
I was born and raised by Christian parents,

00:00:54.310 --> 00:01:00.310
so all through my childhood and teenage years, I was happy serving Jehovah,

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:05.310
but they got a little bit harder when I started to work.

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:10.310
People at work would ask to do social activities with them, go for a drink and things,

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.310
but there were men who would ask me to go out with them.

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.310
It's flattering when someone shows interest in you, so it was nice,

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.310
but it was hard to have to constantly remind yourself,

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.310
well, you know that this is not going to be successful,

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.310
you know this person doesn't love Jehovah.

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.310
I remember one day I drove into a parking lot,

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.310
and I just prayed to Jehovah with tears in my eyes, and I said,

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:37.310
this is too hard.

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.310
This is just too hard.

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.310
The people that were my friends are starting to leave the truth.

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.310
I feel quite lonely, but I want to serve you.

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.310
To that prayer I went home.

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.310
I spoke to my mom, and she got really quiet, and she just looked at me and said,

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.310
anything Jehovah tells you is to benefit yourself.

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.310
And it clicked in that moment that Jehovah was saying to me,

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.310
I love you, I will carry you through this time,

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.310
and you'll see that there will be all these blessings that open up to you,

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.310
and you have a really wonderful, colorful life,

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.310
but you have to hang in there.

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.310
Even though it was hard, I resisted the temptation,

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.310
but someone close to me who faced the same pressure,

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.310
gave in and ended up leaving Jehovah.

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.310
But when I heard that she was disfellowshipped,

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:32.590
it was just completely hit me so hard,

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:38.590
because you really are just worried about what is going to happen with their future.

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.590
After a while, she did come back to Jehovah.

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.590
She's raising a child on her own.

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.590
One day we were having a video chat,

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.590
and with a little one just playing in the background.

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.590
But she suddenly turned around and went,

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.590
mommy, why did you marry someone who doesn't love Jehovah?

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.590
She understood that we need to live according to Jehovah standards.

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:07.590
As elders, we can help people to get up and get back on the path to life,

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.590
and it's a real pleasure.

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.590
I'm reminded about the account of David.

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.590
Eventually he was forgiven, but Jehovah, because he had a good heart.

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.590
However, there were consequences all through his life.

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:25.159
I receive so many blessings, he's sticking to Jehovah.

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:29.159
I found a lovely brother to marry in the Christian congregation,

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:31.159
and we're very happy together.

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:33.159
The thing to do is just stick with Jehovah,

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:35.159
taste and see that Jehovah is good.

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:42.159
When you do that, you will appreciate that there is absolutely no need to go anywhere else.

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:46.159
Having observed what has happened to people who've left the truth,

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:50.159
and the baggage they sometimes end up carrying

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:52.159
when they come back into the truth.

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:54.159
It makes me feel it's just not worth it.

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:56.159
Really, Jehovah is like a parent.

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:58.159
He wants to protect us and care for us.

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:02.159
Things will always work out for the best if you do things Jehovah's way.

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:07.159
I feel my families had many blessings as a husband and a father.

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:10.159
I've got four children who've all grown up in the truth,

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:13.159
and they've all gone on to have good theoretical lives

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:15.159
where they've enjoyed many privileges of service.

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:19.160
So for me, it's been a real blessing to do things Jehovah's way.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:25.160
I think when you test out the world, Satan will give you immediate satisfaction.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.160
But when you serve no purpose to him anymore, that's it.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:34.160
One of the most beautiful blessings I've received is people around you.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.160
Love Jehovah who want to serve him the way you do.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:44.160
I really strongly believe that Jehovah not only gives us a lot of blessings,

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:49.589
but gives us blessings that he's hand-picked for us.

00:04:49.589 --> 00:04:53.589
My observation would be, experience is not the best teacher

00:04:53.589 --> 00:04:55.589
Jehovah is the best teacher.
