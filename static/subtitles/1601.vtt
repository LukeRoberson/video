00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.500
Have you ever been given an assignment that seemed overwhelming?

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:25.379
Jonah experienced self-doubt and fear when he was told to warn the Ninevites of their impending destruction.

00:00:25.379 --> 00:00:30.379
But he learned to trust in Jehovah and he received the courage and the wisdom to do the work.

00:00:30.379 --> 00:00:38.659
In just 40 days more, Ninevah will be overthrown.

00:00:38.659 --> 00:00:47.659
Jonah never imagined his experience would be portrayed in a film meant to encourage millions of people in our day.

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:52.659
The volunteers who made this movie had their own Jonah-like challenges.

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:58.659
For example, the storm, the big fish, and the city of Ninevah,

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:04.659
these elements were unlike anything that the audio video services department had ever filmed.

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:12.659
Careful planning and full reliance on Jehovah would be required to portray these accurately and within budget.

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:19.659
The cast received specialized training to learn their lines and portray the proper emotions for each scene.

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:23.659
The sets were carefully researched and designed.

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:31.170
With set construction taking place at various Bethel facilities, as well as in Southern California.

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.170
Costumes, accurate to the time period in region, were designed.

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:42.730
And makeup was also researched to convey the appropriate styles of the era.

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:46.730
In early 2017, filming began at Mount Ebo.

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:50.730
He claims Jehovah sent a fish to swallow.

00:01:50.730 --> 00:02:02.500
Why are you sleeping? Get off! Call out to your God!

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.500
Later, production moved to Southern California.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:14.500
Where brothers and sisters from local congregations provided meals, tents, vehicles, housing, and most other logistical needs.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:23.500
The outpouring of enthusiastic support was a clear demonstration of their love for Jehovah and his people.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:32.500
When it was time to create the boat sequences, production moved to Louisiana to make use of a large water tank located there.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:40.500
Remote volunteers assisted with the preparation of the tank, as well as labor and materials needed to construct the boat.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.500
Additionally, they provided rescue, diverse support, and meals for the crew.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:53.819
A non-witness consultant had some interesting observations on what he saw.

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:58.819
There's a certain piece about this place. The prayer in the morning is good.

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:02.819
It works. There's no politics on set.

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:08.819
There's a mission and a goal set for the day. It's well explained. It's like a family.

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:14.819
Producers, directors would be rather jealous that it's a well-run tidy operation.

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:19.819
Production finally ended back at the Watchtower Educational Center in Patterson.

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:36.900
In a large outdoor set designed to replicate several streets and a courtyard of Nineveh.

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:42.900
Once principal shooting was completed, visual effects needed to be added to create realistic environments.

00:03:43.900 --> 00:04:11.979
That would make the story even more immersive. Add to that, hundreds of hours spent in the editing rooms, stitching the pieces together to create a cohesive story.

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:21.290
But still more work was needed. Music had to be composed, and sound effects added.

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:32.870
King David set at Psalm 40, 1 through 3.

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:37.870
I earnestly hoped in Jehovah. He made my footing secure.

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:42.870
Many will look on in awe and put their trust in Jehovah.

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:46.870
The volunteers who worked on the Jonah drama found David's words to be true.

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:50.870
Listen to just some of the expressions of appreciation from viewers.

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:58.870
Thank you for all your hard work. We laughed and cried and sat at the edge of our seats and the lessons hit home for each of us.

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:05.870
I try to imagine how to be courageous and boldly preached like Jonah. I no longer felt fear.

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:06.870
Thank you.

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:12.870
Much like Jonah, the cast and crew involved in the making of this film were reminded continuously.

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:17.870
That no matter how challenging the assignment, Jehovah will help us face it.
