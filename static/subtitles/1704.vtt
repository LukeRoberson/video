00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:25.730
I was a bully. I used to steal from others and I was very, very angry. Inside I had feelings

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:39.140
of taking revenge. I wanted revenge. I spent my childhood in a small city of India. My family

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:46.899
was very poor. My parents both had the habit of drinking. Often they had fights at home.

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:53.859
My father would beat my mother with wood and sometimes he would beat us too.

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:01.539
So me and my siblings we would run and hide to the outside toilets and we would wait there

00:01:02.259 --> 00:01:12.980
until the shouting and fighting would stop. One day I saw my father he was full drunk.

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:26.670
I was very small. Maybe six years old and I was playing near the house. My uncle came to the house

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:33.950
screaming at my father. I ran to see what was happening but there was nothing I could do.

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:51.060
When in front of my own eyes my father was murdered. Later I was taken away from my mother to work

00:01:51.060 --> 00:02:00.420
as a servant. They treated me terribly. With punches and kicks they even strangled me once.

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:13.330
I missed my mother. I felt so alone. My mother was suffering from cancer. I asked them many times

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:21.169
that I want to go and see my mother but they wouldn't let me go. I started crying. I said I want to go

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:31.569
home but they said going now will be of no use because your mother has already been dead for four days.

00:02:34.419 --> 00:02:48.419
I cried a lot. I could not see my mother one last time. All of this made me feel so angry inside.

00:02:48.419 --> 00:02:56.270
I was always fighting, bullying and stealing. Eventually I was thrown out of the house.

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:04.349
This time a relative took me in. I noticed her daughter would go somewhere every Sunday and

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:11.389
this made me very curious. So I asked her where she would go and she said to Bible meetings.

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:19.419
Her daughter also told me that a couple would come every Friday to study the Bible with her.

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:34.370
She invited me to join her if I wanted. So I decided to sit in on her study. I was impressed

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:41.409
with a brother studying with her. They were so kind. They cared a lot and showed love.

00:03:41.969 --> 00:03:48.860
That was not seen in churches. On one occasion I found myself running again.

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:59.340
But this time I was running to the kingdom hall to see my new family. It was about 10 km away

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:06.939
but I had no money to go by vehicle. So instead I went by foot but every step was worth it because

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:15.360
at meeting I really felt Jehovah's love through the brothers and sisters. As my study slowly

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:31.089
progressed I began to realize I'm not an orphan. Jehovah is with me. He is my father. Eventually

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:37.889
I was able to throw all my burdens on my father Jehovah and I started to have peace of mind.

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:50.689
So I dedicated my life to Jehovah. On December 26, 1998 I was baptized. After my baptism I wanted to

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:58.930
give Jehovah my best. Today me and my wife Julian we are so happy to be in full time service together.

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:12.689
And thanks to Jehovah we have enjoyed a variety of assignments as a couple. My past cannot be raised

00:05:13.089 --> 00:05:23.040
neither can I stop these memories from coming into my mind. But Jehovah has completely changed my life.

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:33.379
I no longer feel anger or the need for revenge anymore. So there is no need to feel orphaned.

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:41.139
Give yourselves completely to the hands of Jehovah. He's your father. He will take care of you. He will

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:42.740
never leave you.
