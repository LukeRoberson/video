00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:12.179
It was a dark and gloomy morning, but my husband and my daughter took their bicycles and

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.280
went out to care for their Bible studies.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:25.199
That evening around 5pm I was waiting for them to return, but instead I received a message

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:31.829
that my husband had died in an accident.

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:37.909
That night I really wanted to receive comfort, but because of the bad weather I couldn't

00:00:37.909 --> 00:00:41.070
tell others about the accident.

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.869
That evening my two daughters and I tried to look for strength and comfort by reading

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:50.829
our organisation's publications.

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:56.789
Unexpectedly, even despite the bad weather, three of our brothers and sisters visited

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.390
our home.

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:05.450
They rode their motorbikes over two hours through the heavy rain.

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:10.129
But around midnight, seven more brothers and sisters from our small group came to our

00:01:10.129 --> 00:01:12.129
house by foot.

00:01:12.129 --> 00:01:17.609
It took them an hour and a half to walk bare foot through the rain and mud in the dark

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:19.609
to reach us.

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:26.409
Our family was strengthened by the brothers and sisters visit that night.

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:31.810
Because our village was very superstitious, I worried that the death of my husband would

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:37.810
bring reproach to Jehovah's name, so I prayed about this matter to Jehovah.

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:43.170
The next day many more brothers and sisters from our neighbouring congregations visited our

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.170
family.

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:52.489
Rather than reproach the love of the brothers brought glory and praise to Jehovah's name.

00:01:52.489 --> 00:01:58.730
Thanks to the love and support that our brothers and sisters showed us, my oldest daughter

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:10.560
is currently serving at Bethel and my younger daughter is happily serving Jehovah with me.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:17.120
In the new world, I would like to tell my husband of the unfailing love the brothers and

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:24.520
sisters have shown our family and how I trained our daughters to continue to progress spiritually

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:31.289
to the best of my ability with the help.

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:33.289
One elder said to me,

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:38.610
we are more than happy to assist with your material needs.

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:47.650
Although I have become a widow, such kindness helped me to overcome my despair and renew my

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:56.689
hope, the love of our brothers and sisters enabled our family to endure this tragedy.
