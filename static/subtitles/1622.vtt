Men of Athens, I see that in all things, you seem to be more given to the fear of the

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.939
deities than others are.

00:00:34.939 --> 00:00:42.380
For instance, while passing along and carefully observing your objects of veneration, I found

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:50.939
even an altar on which had been inscribed to an unknown God, therefore what you are

00:00:50.939 --> 00:00:54.219
unknowingly worshiping.

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:55.820
This I am declaring to you.
