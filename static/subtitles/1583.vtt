00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:39.310
Oh wait, I forgot. You should cook every night. If you clean every night.

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:51.310
No, we'll take it in turns. But this looks amazing. Thanks. It's a practice for my first guest.

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:56.560
Really? Who? My mum. That's wonderful.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:03.810
We had our first phone call in a year that wasn't a total disaster, so I invited her on tomorrow.

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:40.450
It'll go great. Hi mum. Hello, love. Come in. Nice to see you. Nice to see you too. Let me take that.

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:56.980
Oh, thanks, my love. You're roommates. You say the explorer is?

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:04.980
The pioneers. They preach full-time, but they work part-time.

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:20.340
I see. But you, you're no. Not yet anyway. Jade, love. All this. I see it's made you a better person.

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:40.050
Have a nose, I tried. But I miss bits of the old Jade. Bits? What bits? Where's the Jade that questioned everything?

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:48.050
So then she pulls out her phone, start showing me stuff about witnesses. What kind of stuff? New stories, all negative and slanted.

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:56.050
I tried to change the subject, but she just kept at it. See you later, girls. Bye.

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:35.810
Sorry, I am. I gotta get ready. Oh, how long are you gonna be gone for? I was too hot here.

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:47.870
Abigail? Jade, girl. Been better. Don't your mother visit you? I hope you don't mind. No.

00:03:47.870 --> 00:04:00.870
Mum's driving me mad. It's like it's her hobby to ruin my life. Like me when my daughter got baptized.

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:20.029
You opposed your daughter? Oh my, so much. I didn't want to lose her. I'm not going anywhere. Of course not, but a worried mother doesn't know that.

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:33.180
I got to go, the scripture for you. When you read it, remember, your mum is not the stranger.

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:46.399
John, chapter 10 and verse 5. They will by no means follow a stranger, but will flee from him.

00:04:46.399 --> 00:05:08.449
Because they do not know the voice of strangers. Mum is not the stranger. It's what she shares. We check the voice.

00:05:14.819 --> 00:05:21.930
Did you look at those links that I sent you? Mum.

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:30.199
I want us to get together, but I won't hear anything negative about my beliefs.

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:37.199
Well, perhaps we just won't talk religion. Is it deal then? All right then. I can see I'm not gonna get anywhere.

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:50.589
So what subject do you want to talk about? The deal fell apart. Fast.

00:05:50.589 --> 00:05:56.589
Jade, I know we weren't gonna talk religion, but I must tell you this one thing that I read.

00:05:56.589 --> 00:06:13.040
I thought we weren't gonna talk about this. Just getting late. I'm gonna go. Thanks for dinner.

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:37.250
I'll quit tomorrow. Jade, I got an alert this morning and I'm really confused about this. No, I don't mind.

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:46.350
I was sure this wouldn't work. It happened, Jade.

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:57.959
I'd like to change our agreement. If I ask you what you believe, you get to answer.

00:06:57.959 --> 00:07:07.420
Sure answers, I won't be converting. Is the deal then? Yeah, it's a deal.
