00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:05.639
How important is the use of illustrations?

00:00:05.639 --> 00:00:08.839
Are they simply fluff and are teaching?

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:13.039
One definition of the English word fluff is this.

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:17.239
Something essentially trivial and lacking importance

00:00:17.239 --> 00:00:19.739
or solid worth.

00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:24.239
Are illustrations trivial and of little worth?

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:29.239
Please follow along on screen as I read our theme scripture.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.039
Matthew 1334.

00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:38.140
All these things Jesus spoke to the crowds by illustrations.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:43.520
Indeed, without an illustration, he would not speak to them.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.119
We often call Jesus the great teacher.

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:52.719
Illustrations were essential to fully grasp what was being taught.

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:56.119
Now, we won't be spending a lot of time on the do's and don'ts

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:58.820
of using illustrations.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:04.019
Insight on the scriptures has a whole topic on illustrations.

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.519
And the apply yourself to reading and teaching brochure

00:01:07.519 --> 00:01:12.019
has some helpful suggestions in lesson eight.

00:01:12.019 --> 00:01:15.519
Let me remind you also of a talk that brother

00:01:15.519 --> 00:01:20.920
explain of the governing body gave at the 2020 regional convention.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:26.219
The title was improve your skills illustrating key points.

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:31.219
It had some very practical suggestions, which I won't be repeating here.

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:33.019
So perhaps you'll want to review brother

00:01:33.019 --> 00:01:38.599
splains talk and an upcoming family worship.

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:42.599
At times, the Bible actually identifies Jesus expression

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:45.099
as an illustration.

00:01:45.099 --> 00:01:47.500
Most of the time, it does not.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.500
It was just part of the way he spoke naturally.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.349
Illustrations flowed from him.

00:01:54.349 --> 00:01:58.150
Well, how did he come up with them so readily?

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:03.049
Jesus was observant of what was happening around him.

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:05.549
We too can be observant.

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:10.449
This will help to train us to think in illustrations.

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:13.349
The bread and the wine used at the memorial of Christ's death

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:17.150
beautifully represented Jesus perfect body and blood

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.449
that would be given in behalf of sinful mankind.

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:25.349
But we can learn something about our use of illustrations

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:29.849
by considering the circumstances of the Lord's evening meal.

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:31.650
Think about it.

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.050
From years of attending, Jesus knew what was going to be

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.050
on the Passover table that night.

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.050
So he could have thought in advance of using those emblems

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.550
in that way.

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.550
We don't know for sure.

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:50.650
But what a simple logical and indelible impression

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.949
it made that night and continues to make

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.849
on millions of us some 2,000 years later.

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:02.550
If we're going to give a talk or demonstration at one of our meetings,

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.150
we already know the topic.

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:11.050
So we have the luxury of thinking of an illustration in advance.

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.849
But what if we're teaching a Bible student

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:17.550
and he asks us an unexpected question?

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:21.849
At that moment, you're likely mentally consider your student,

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:24.849
what you know about his work, his hobbies,

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:27.750
or just his daily life experiences,

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.550
and an illustration may come to your mind

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.349
on the spur of the moment.

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:35.949
Well, let's see how that latter process,

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:40.949
an unexpected situation, was faced by Jesus.

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:44.650
In this case, we can understand his thought process

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.449
and coming up with masterful illustrations.

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:51.150
In John chapter four,

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.650
he's account about the Samaritan woman at the well.

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:59.150
John 434, Jesus used the illustration of food.

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.150
He said there,

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.050
my food is to do the will of him who sent me

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:07.750
and to finish his work.

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.750
That's a simple, effective illustration.

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:16.550
Why might he have used the generic expression food

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:18.449
instead of something more specific

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:21.350
like my wine or my bread

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.350
is to do the will of him who sent me?

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:27.350
Well, let's look at the context.

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.250
Interestingly, in quick succession,

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:33.250
Jesus used two different illustrations

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.149
and in both cases,

00:04:35.149 --> 00:04:36.949
it seems from the context

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:38.149
that he came up with these

00:04:38.149 --> 00:04:41.949
based on what was happening at the time.

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:44.649
John 4.7 says,

00:04:44.649 --> 00:04:48.250
a woman of Samaria came to draw water.

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:49.949
Jesus said to her,

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:52.750
give me a drink.

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.649
Well, that set up number one

00:04:54.649 --> 00:04:57.949
for an illustration about water.

00:04:57.949 --> 00:04:59.949
Verse eight says,

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:04.750
for his disciples had gone off into the city to buy food.

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:06.949
That set up number two

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:10.550
for an illustration about food.

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:13.949
Now, Jesus didn't orchestrate all of this in advance.

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:15.850
It was just circumstantial

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:17.949
that Jesus asked a woman who approached

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:21.649
with a water jar to give him a drink.

00:05:21.649 --> 00:05:24.149
But Jesus instantly thought

00:05:24.149 --> 00:05:26.949
and used the subject of water

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:29.550
as an illustration.

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:32.250
Verse 10 says,

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:35.750
if you had known of the free gift of God

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:37.850
and who it is who says to you,

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:39.750
give me a drink,

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:41.250
you would have asked him

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:45.750
and he would have given you living water.

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:48.550
The illustration was spontaneous.

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:53.649
It effectively led to a fine witness about Jesus.

00:05:53.649 --> 00:05:55.750
Now, illustration number two,

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:58.250
look at verse 27.

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:00.449
Jesus is still talking to the woman

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:03.949
when the disciples returned from the city.

00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:05.149
I do remember that

00:06:05.149 --> 00:06:07.350
verse eight said that the disciples had gone

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:10.649
into the city to buy food.

00:06:10.649 --> 00:06:12.449
So they come back

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:15.649
and they have some food for Jesus.

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:17.649
Going to verse 28,

00:06:17.649 --> 00:06:19.050
the woman leaves,

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:21.949
notice the disciples now say to Jesus,

00:06:21.949 --> 00:06:25.750
which is a setup for illustration number two.

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:27.149
Not water,

00:06:27.149 --> 00:06:31.250
but food now becomes the topic of conversation.

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:33.449
Verse 31.

00:06:33.449 --> 00:06:36.350
Meanwhile, the disciples were urging him

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:38.850
rabbi eat.

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:40.350
The word eat caused Jesus

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:43.050
to think of the now famous illustration

00:06:43.149 --> 00:06:45.850
that we quote regularly.

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:47.850
Verse 32.

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:49.449
But he said to them,

00:06:49.449 --> 00:06:51.649
I have food to eat

00:06:51.649 --> 00:06:53.949
that you do not know about.

00:06:53.949 --> 00:06:56.250
Well, the disciples are puzzled.

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:58.149
Verse 33.

00:06:58.149 --> 00:07:00.649
So the disciples said to one another,

00:07:00.649 --> 00:07:04.250
no one brought him anything to eat, did he?

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:06.649
Jesus picking up on the topic at hand,

00:07:06.649 --> 00:07:08.250
said to them,

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:12.250
my food is to do the will of him who sent me

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:14.850
and finish his work.

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:17.350
Now, obviously Jesus did not choreograph

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:19.649
all this in advance.

00:07:19.649 --> 00:07:22.550
But based on the circumstances at hand,

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:26.850
he came up with illustrations that worked.

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:28.850
Well, in what way?

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:30.350
Well, which is the point of similarity

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:34.649
between God's will and food?

00:07:34.649 --> 00:07:36.350
Eating good food is enjoyable.

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:38.149
It's satisfying.

00:07:38.149 --> 00:07:39.550
The point.

00:07:39.649 --> 00:07:42.449
Jesus enjoyed doing God's will.

00:07:42.449 --> 00:07:44.250
It was satisfying to him

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:47.350
like eating a tasty meal.

00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:49.649
Another point of similarity.

00:07:49.649 --> 00:07:52.449
Food invigorates a person.

00:07:52.449 --> 00:07:54.750
Jesus was invigorated

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:58.649
by that conversation with the American woman.

00:07:58.649 --> 00:08:02.350
I'll glance back up at verses three through six.

00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:05.850
Says Jesus had left Judea on foot.

00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:07.850
Look at verse six.

00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:12.550
Now Jesus tired out as he was from the journey

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:14.550
with sitting at the well.

00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:17.250
It was about the six hour.

00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:20.750
However, after witnessing to the woman at the well,

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:23.149
Jesus is invigorated.

00:08:23.149 --> 00:08:25.149
He even alluded to the idea

00:08:25.149 --> 00:08:28.050
that the experience was more energizing

00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:31.000
than literal food.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000
What if we learned thus far from the process?

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.399
If you know beforehand,

00:08:37.399 --> 00:08:39.299
what will be discussed,

00:08:39.299 --> 00:08:40.500
that gives you the opportunity

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:45.600
to think of an appropriate illustration in advance.

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:48.299
If something comes up unexpectedly,

00:08:48.299 --> 00:08:51.799
often you can use what you've observed around you

00:08:51.799 --> 00:08:53.299
or what you already know

00:08:53.299 --> 00:08:57.539
to generate an effective illustration.

00:08:57.539 --> 00:08:59.840
You might be thinking,

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:02.039
I'm not really creative.

00:09:02.039 --> 00:09:05.539
It takes a while for me to think of an illustration

00:09:05.539 --> 00:09:07.139
even when I know in advance

00:09:07.139 --> 00:09:10.240
that I have an assignment at the meeting.

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:12.340
On this spot illustration,

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:14.840
it's probably not going to happen for me

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:19.840
with the way my brain works or doesn't work.

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:22.340
Is there a way to train the brain

00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:25.539
to think in illustration mode?

00:09:25.539 --> 00:09:26.940
Yes.

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:28.840
How?

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:32.039
One way is by observing creation

00:09:32.039 --> 00:09:34.139
or man-made inventions,

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:37.240
even when you don't have a talk to give,

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:40.740
even when your children are not with you.

00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:42.240
Think about what you observe

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:44.940
and reason out how it could be applied

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:48.340
as a teaching lesson in the future.

00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:49.639
Write it down if you need to

00:09:49.639 --> 00:09:52.340
so as to remember it.

00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:55.039
One father told me that even when his children

00:09:55.039 --> 00:09:57.039
were not with him,

00:09:57.039 --> 00:09:58.940
he would look at creation

00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:01.340
and come up with a line of reasoning

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:04.139
that might be helpful in the future.

00:10:04.139 --> 00:10:06.440
And he gave an example.

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:10.039
He observed two kittens playing together.

00:10:10.039 --> 00:10:11.940
He reasoned.

00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:13.940
Do those kittens look happy?

00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:15.840
Yes.

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:19.940
If Jehovah knows what it takes to make two kittens happy,

00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:24.539
do you think he knows what it would take to make you happy?

00:10:24.539 --> 00:10:28.340
Well, obviously a child would agree.

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:30.440
So if Jehovah knows what it would take

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:32.539
to make you happy,

00:10:32.539 --> 00:10:34.740
what should you do if Jehovah says

00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:37.539
to do something a certain way?

00:10:37.539 --> 00:10:39.740
Profound dad.

00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:44.039
Do it Jehovah's way if you want to be happy.

00:10:44.039 --> 00:10:45.340
Now the beautiful reality,

00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:47.539
the golden moment,

00:10:47.539 --> 00:10:51.039
was when he saw one of his sons watching two squirrels

00:10:51.039 --> 00:10:53.740
and a tree chasing each other.

00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:56.740
He used the squirrels as his illustration

00:10:56.740 --> 00:11:00.639
along with the prepared line of reasoning.

00:11:00.639 --> 00:11:06.740
Now his son still remembers that point many decades later.

00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:09.740
Jesus brain thought creatively

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:12.840
when using illustrations.

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:14.240
For another example,

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:18.940
please turn with me to John 142.

00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:24.139
Jesus changed Simon's name on the spot.

00:11:24.139 --> 00:11:26.440
John 142.

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:32.240
And he and group led him Simon to Jesus.

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:33.440
When Jesus looked at him,

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:34.240
he said,

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:36.940
you are Simon the son of John.

00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:39.440
You will be called Seifis,

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:42.639
which is translated Peter.

00:11:42.639 --> 00:11:48.340
Now why did Jesus change his name to Seifis or Peter?

00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:51.840
It actually seems to be a creative thinking.

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:54.740
The Greek word for Peter is Petros,

00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:56.940
not Petra.

00:11:56.940 --> 00:11:59.440
Petra means rock mass.

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:01.139
And that applies to Jesus,

00:12:01.139 --> 00:12:01.940
the cornerstone,

00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:04.740
the head of the Christian congregation.

00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:09.039
However, Petros means a piece of rock.

00:12:09.039 --> 00:12:12.940
What a beautiful description of Peter.

00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:16.240
At times Peter didn't seem to be dependable.

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:18.639
But Jesus saw good qualities in him

00:12:18.639 --> 00:12:21.139
and gave him the name Peter.

00:12:21.139 --> 00:12:24.639
Petros, piece of rock.

00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:26.340
In effect,

00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:30.539
Jesus was saying that he would become as stable as a rock.

00:12:30.539 --> 00:12:33.539
And that's precisely what transpired.

00:12:33.539 --> 00:12:38.740
What a great word picture or illustration by Jesus.

00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:43.139
At Revelation 11 under inspiration to John,

00:12:43.139 --> 00:12:45.940
Jehovah said that that book of the Bible was

00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:48.940
a revelation by Jesus Christ,

00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:51.639
which God gave to him.

00:12:51.639 --> 00:12:54.139
The insight book says

00:12:54.139 --> 00:12:57.440
the book of Revelation concludes the Holy Scriptures

00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:00.840
with one of the most outstanding concentrations

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:05.840
of illustrations found in the entire Bible.

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:09.840
You recall our theme is Matthew 1334.

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:11.340
Without an illustration,

00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:14.440
he would not speak to them.

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:15.740
As another example,

00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:18.940
Jesus gave his famous sermon on the mountain.

00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:20.639
In Matthew chapter 7,

00:13:20.639 --> 00:13:22.639
the last chapter of that sermon,

00:13:22.639 --> 00:13:27.139
he used at least 10 different illustrations.

00:13:27.139 --> 00:13:29.639
Yes, without an illustration,

00:13:29.639 --> 00:13:32.539
he would not speak to them.

00:13:32.539 --> 00:13:35.340
Matthew 728 sums up the sermon on the mountain,

00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:37.340
saying,

00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:40.240
when Jesus finished these sayings,

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:43.440
the effect was that the crowds were astounded

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:45.940
at his way of teaching.

00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:50.440
First Peter 221 says that Jesus left a model

00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:53.840
for us to follow his steps closely.

00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:56.240
That includes his art of teaching

00:13:56.240 --> 00:14:00.440
which incorporated extensive use of illustrations.

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:03.539
They were pithy and to the point.

00:14:03.539 --> 00:14:06.840
May each of us train ourselves to think that way

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:09.639
and strive to improve our teaching skills

00:14:09.639 --> 00:14:12.139
by means of illustrations.
