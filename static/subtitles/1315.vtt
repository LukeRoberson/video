00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:08.490
Have you ever asked yourself what is really the difference between an international convention and a special convention?

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.490
Are they both the same, but just with a different name?

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.489
No. There are actually some fundamental differences.

00:00:16.489 --> 00:00:21.489
International conventions are usually scheduled every four or five years,

00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:28.489
whereas special conventions are held yearly, as long as no international convention is scheduled.

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:36.490
Also, international conventions are generally held in large venues, with a minimum of 20,000 attendees.

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:45.490
Special conventions are often held in smaller size venues, usually including fewer than 12,000 on-site attendees,

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.490
although additional sites may be tied in as well.

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:53.490
There is a difference in the number of foreign delegates as well.

00:00:53.490 --> 00:01:00.490
Twice as many foreign delegates are invited to attend international conventions, as compared to special conventions.

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:07.489
And international conventions also provide an opportunity for the branch to invite those in foreign service,

00:01:07.489 --> 00:01:14.489
including our missionaries, to return home for a visit, using funds contributed by the worldwide brotherhood.
