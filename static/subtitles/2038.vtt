00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and introduction to the book of Genesis.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Genesis was completed by Moses in the wilderness of Sinai in 1513 BCE.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Born in 1593 BCE, Moses was a prophet, leader, judge, historian, and mediator.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
He wrote the first five books of the Bible called the Pentateuch,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.000
as well as Job, Psalm 90, and possibly Psalm 91.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
The name Genesis means origin or birth.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:50.000
The book explains the origin of the universe and how God prepared the earth for people to live on it.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:01:01.000
The account also describes the origin of the Israelites and their growth in Egypt until the death of Joseph in 1657 BCE.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.439
Genesis has 50 chapters.

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:21.439
Chapters 1 and 2 outline how God, in six periods called days, prepared the earth for humans and then created the first man and woman, Adam and Eve.

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:28.439
They were to fill the earth and subdue it, and they had the prospect of everlasting life.

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:34.439
In chapter 3, Eve is tempted by a serpent to disobey God.

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:41.439
Adam joins her in disobedience, bringing sin and death into the human family.

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:51.439
In chapter 6, wicked angels materialize and take women as wives, producing hybrid offspring called Nephilim.

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:59.439
Wickedness abounds, and God decides to put an end to all flesh by means of a great flood.

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:11.439
Noah, however, has found favor with God, who tells him to build an ark to save his family and the various kinds of animals.

00:02:11.439 --> 00:02:24.439
In chapters 10 and 11, we read that after the flood, people start to build a city with a great tower, thus defying God's purpose for humans to fill the earth.

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:29.439
But God confuses their language, scattering them.

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:36.439
Chapters 11 to 25 focus on Abraham, a man of faith.

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:51.439
In chapter 12, Jehovah tells Abraham, then called Abram, to enter the land where he would one day become a great nation, and the means by which all peoples will be blessed.

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:57.439
In chapter 15, Jehovah tells Abram to look up and count the stars if he can.

00:02:57.439 --> 00:03:02.439
So your offspring will become, God says.

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:04.439
Did you know?

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:08.439
Genesis sets the theme for the entire Bible.

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:20.439
The vindication of Jehovah's right to rule, and the fulfillment of his purpose for the earth and mankind by means of his kingdom, in the hands of a future offspring.

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:26.439
This offspring and his work were first foretold at Genesis 3.15.

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:40.099
The book of Revelation shows how that offspring crushes the original serpent, Satan, and brings the promised blessings to all obedient mankind.

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:51.099
In chapter 19, God destroys Sodom, Gomorrah, and neighboring cities because of their gross sexual immorality.

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:58.099
In chapter 22, Jehovah tells Abraham to sacrifice his son Isaac.

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:09.099
But when Abraham attempts to do so, Jehovah stops him and reaffirms his earlier promises concerning Abraham's future offspring.

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:20.100
Chapters 24 to 50 focus largely on Isaac, his twin sons Jacob and Esau, and Jacob's son Joseph.

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:26.100
Isaac blesses Jacob, who then goes to distant Patan, Abraham.

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:37.100
There, by means of Leah, Rachel, and their two maid servants, Jacob fathers many children including 11 sons.

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:48.100
Jacob then returns to Canaan, where God changes his name to Israel, and where Rachel gives birth to Jacob's 12th son.

00:04:48.100 --> 00:05:01.100
Chapters 37 to 41 tell how Jacob's 17-year-old son Joseph is sold by his brothers and becomes a slave to Potiphar, a court official of Pharaoh.

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:12.100
Potiphar's wife later tries to seduce Joseph, but fails. She accuses him of sexual assault, and he is imprisoned.

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:20.100
When Joseph is 30 years old and still a prisoner, he interprets Pharaoh's dreams with the help of God's spirit.

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:27.100
As a result, Joseph is set free and appointed Prime Minister of Egypt.

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:37.100
In chapters 42 to 47, Joseph is reunited with his family, who settle in Egypt as alien residents.

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:44.100
Chapter 49 contains Jacob's deathbed prophecy about his sons.

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:54.100
Judah's family line will produce the promised offspring, that is, Shiloh, the one to whom the obedience of the peoples will belong.

00:05:54.100 --> 00:06:02.100
As you read the book of Genesis, note how it explains the root cause of mankind's suffering.

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:08.100
See how and why the patriarchs gained God's favor and blessing.

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:17.100
And read how Jehovah's promises to those men of faith, point forward to Jesus Christ, the King of God's Kingdom.
