WEBVTT

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:28.460
On behalf of the governing body, we warmly commend you for your desire to expand your service to Jehovah and your interest in submitting an application to serve as a temporary volunteer or as a member of the worldwide order of special full-time servants of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:37.460
By making yourself available to serve in this unique way, you imitate the faithful prophet Isaiah, who said at Isaiah 6 verse 8,

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:49.460
here I am, send me. Submitting your application may open a door of opportunity to serve Jehovah and his organization in a variety of ways.

00:00:49.460 --> 00:01:04.459
Of course, there's a place for everyone in Jehovah's service, whether we're working hard as a congregation publisher, a regular pioneer, a Bethelite, or on a Theocratic construction project.

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:12.459
We have the satisfaction of knowing that Jehovah treasures what we're doing because of our heartfelt love for him.

00:01:12.459 --> 00:01:15.459
Hebrews 6 verse 10 says,

00:01:15.459 --> 00:01:27.459
God is not unrighteous, so as to forget your work and the love you showed for His name by ministering and continuing to minister to the holy ones.

00:01:27.459 --> 00:01:39.459
Before submitting an application for expanded Theocratic service, it's important to consider prayerfully how you'll respond to the questions on the application.

00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:43.459
Hebrews 13, 18 says,

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:59.459
We wish to conduct ourselves honestly in all things, so you should be honest in answering the questions on the application, especially those that have to do with your physical health and spiritual health.

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:09.460
The work being done at Bethel and on Theocratic construction projects requires good physical, emotional, and mental health.

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:19.460
However, you may have a chronic health problem that requires the regular attention of a physician or must be treated with medication.

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:35.460
If you have a significant limitation in this way, it would be better for you to continue your faithful service in the field with your local congregation and if possible in the regular pioneer service.

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:44.460
If you're not sure whether your health situation would prevent you from submitting an application, the elders in your congregation can help you.

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:56.460
They can review with you the specific application questions that deal with health matters so that you personally may determine whether or not you should apply.

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:02.460
Regardless of where we're serving, we need Jehovah's blessing to be successful.

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:06.460
Psalm 127 verse 1 says,

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:48.460
Our service to Jehovah is important. We cannot afford to lose Jehovah's blessing.

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:55.460
For this reason, the spiritual qualifications for expanded service are high.

00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:06.460
It's expected that all of those offering themselves to serve at Bethel or in other Theocratic assignments have a clean conscience before Jehovah.

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:18.459
Having left behind all unclean practices or immoral conduct. For instance, those who have viewed pornography in the past year should not apply.

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:37.459
Also, if you realize that you may have become involved in unclean conduct with someone of the opposite sex or the same sex, Jehovah very considerably explains what we should do in James 5 verses 14 and 15.

00:04:37.459 --> 00:04:47.459
Is there anyone spiritually sick among you? Let him call the elders of the congregation to him and let them pray over him,

00:04:47.459 --> 00:05:02.459
applying oil to him in the name of Jehovah, and the prayer of faith will make the sick one well, and Jehovah will raise him up. Also, if he has committed sins, he will be forgiven.

00:05:03.459 --> 00:05:14.459
How reassuring! If you have a heavy conscience because of something you've done, you should get help to strengthen your relationship with Jehovah.

00:05:14.459 --> 00:05:21.459
You can later submit an application with a clean conscience, confident that Jehovah will bless your efforts.

00:05:22.459 --> 00:05:37.459
So don't hesitate to speak with one of the elders in your congregation if you need help. They love you and want you to progress and qualify for special privileges of service in Jehovah's organization.

00:05:37.459 --> 00:05:44.459
We've spoken frankly to you because we want you to make a success of your service to Jehovah.

00:05:44.459 --> 00:05:50.459
We also want to reassure you that your assistance is very much needed.

00:05:50.459 --> 00:06:07.459
So if you enjoy good health, both spiritually and physically, and want to apply for expanded theocratic service on a temporary or full-time basis, ask your elders for an application to serve as a temporary volunteer,

00:06:07.459 --> 00:06:15.459
or as a member of the worldwide order of special full-time servants of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:06:15.459 --> 00:06:26.459
After completing the application, return it to your elders. Then continue to allow Jehovah to direct your steps wherever you may serve.

00:06:26.459 --> 00:06:38.459
We love you for the willing spirit you show. Please be assured of our prayers in your behalf as you continue to reach out in Jehovah's service.
