00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:06.830
Welcome to this special report.

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:11.470
No doubt you've been hearing on the news about the tremendous natural disasters that have

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:15.710
been affecting a whole region of our Earth.

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:20.030
We know you're concerned about our brothers and sisters in these areas.

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:25.070
And so we wanted to provide you with this update as to the situation of our brothers in

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:30.710
Mexico, the Caribbean, and the United States.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.149
This is the time of the end.

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:40.189
Matthew 24-7 indicates that in the last days, there will be earthquakes in one place

00:00:40.189 --> 00:00:42.270
after another.

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.710
Jesus said that we should expect to see this, so we are not surprised that we are seeing

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:54.109
an increasing number of earthquakes and other natural disasters in the world.

00:00:54.109 --> 00:01:00.670
However, we want to do everything possible to provide our brothers and sisters with the

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.469
relief aid that they need.

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:09.950
According to Acts chapter 11 and verse 29, the disciples determined to send relief to

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.109
their brothers who were experiencing famine.

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:19.950
In this program, we will give you an update on how Jehovah's modern-day organization

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.870
is following this scriptural pattern and responding to the needs of our brothers in

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:28.310
hard-hit areas.

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.510
We will interview brothers from three different branch offices, as well as a representative

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.590
of the coordinators' committee.

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:42.030
Several of these brothers have just visited the disaster areas and they have important

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.510
information for us.

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:50.310
We'll begin by going to Mexico, where we have brother Ed Bunn, who serves on the Central

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.310
America Branch Committee live with us.

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.310
Welcome, Ed.

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:55.310
It's very good to see you.

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.670
Tell us a little bit about what's happening in Mexico.

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.030
How are our brothers doing?

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.030
Yes, Mark.

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.829
It's very nice to be able to speak with you, too.

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:12.229
You know our brothers here in the past four or five weeks have felt the force of a tropical

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:17.909
storm, two hurricanes, and two very devastating earthquakes.

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:26.830
The first earthquake was an 8.2 magnitude quake on September the 7th, and the second was

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:32.110
a 7.1 magnitude earthquake on September 19th.

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:39.189
The first earthquake affected the areas, the states of Chiapas and Wahaka.

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:44.949
That's where we have our largest concentration of Jehovah's Witnesses and Kingdom Halls.

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:51.710
And in just a matter of minutes, these areas were completely devastated.

00:02:51.710 --> 00:03:00.830
Over 800 of our brothers' homes were either destroyed or they were suffered major damage.

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:07.590
Many people in these two states were trapped under their homes when they collapsed on them.

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.150
And three of our brothers also lost their lives.

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:22.270
The second earthquake occurred here in Mexico City and in the states of Puebla and in Morelos.

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:27.949
And you know, Mark, we still don't have a complete figure or picture to help us to understand

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:33.550
the complete impact that this earthquake has had and continues to have on our brothers.

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:36.310
But we do know that they're being well cared for.

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:41.990
Well, Ed, we're very, very sorry to hear about our brothers and especially the loss

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:47.310
of life, but it's encouraging to know that the Central America Branch Committee is right

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.830
on top of the situation and that you're getting involved to help our brothers.

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:58.370
Can you tell us a little bit more about what's happening with regard to the relief?

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:04.610
Well, because the two earthquakes occurred just within like 12 days of one another

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:10.610
and the destruction is so widespread and the needs of the brothers are so varied.

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:18.569
Our branch committee has formed a special relief committees to cover the four affected areas.

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:24.569
But even before the brothers were able to gather up their reports and send them here to the branch,

00:04:24.569 --> 00:04:27.209
they were already helping one another.

00:04:27.209 --> 00:04:35.850
The circuit overseers, the elders, the members of the disaster committees were doing all that they could

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:39.410
to be able to help the brothers and provide for their needs.

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:41.850
They wanted to comfort the brothers.

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:44.610
They wanted to provide for them whatever they needed.

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:50.170
They wanted to make certainly a carry on as they could with their spiritual routines.

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:54.370
And so they took the initiative to help our brothers and they wanted to assure the brothers

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:59.649
that they weren't going to have to face this adversity alone.

00:04:59.649 --> 00:05:06.209
Some of the brothers who had lost their own homes made certain that their families were okay

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:11.689
and then they set out to be able to account for the other brothers in the congregation

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:14.050
to take care of these brothers.

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:19.610
Others who weren't so adversely affected, well, they gathered up food and water.

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:24.290
They went out and bought food, water, blankets, other provisions.

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:28.370
And they took them to where the brothers were more needy.

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:32.290
Often this was done with a certain risk to their own lives

00:05:32.329 --> 00:05:36.970
because many of the buildings were collapsing in these areas.

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:39.889
But our brothers felt that they were not alone.

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:42.610
The brothers felt that they were being cared for.

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:47.370
And we feel that that was really the direction of Jehovah's spirit over them.

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:54.970
Since the earthquakes, they've continued to be repeated aftershocks, thousands of them.

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:59.449
And this, of course, puts in jeopardy the homes and the buildings that have already been damaged.

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:03.290
It obligates people to continue to sleep out in the open.

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:07.889
It makes people fear for maybe even a greater earthquake that will be coming.

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:12.490
But despite all of this, our brothers are showing that they love one another.

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:14.129
They love Jehovah.

00:06:14.129 --> 00:06:17.529
They have strong faith and confidence in Jehovah.

00:06:17.529 --> 00:06:21.009
And for us here in the branch, it's just a matter of being able to see.

00:06:21.009 --> 00:06:25.009
They really have love that is in action.

00:06:25.009 --> 00:06:29.329
You know, that is so heartwarming for us to hear this about how our brothers

00:06:29.329 --> 00:06:32.329
are helping each other and coming to their aid.

00:06:32.329 --> 00:06:35.170
You know, it's what we feel we would do if we were there.

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:38.370
But it just warms our hearts to hear about this.

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:48.540
Ed, is there been something that you could share with us that perhaps is especially warmed your heart or has been especially encouraging for you?

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:53.180
Well, Mark, one very moving experience had to do with one of our brothers

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:56.339
who was serving on one of the relief committees.

00:06:56.379 --> 00:06:59.899
And he was visiting the brothers who, in his area,

00:06:59.899 --> 00:07:03.459
who had been affected by the earthquake.

00:07:03.459 --> 00:07:09.139
He visited one brother who had just lost his new, very modern home.

00:07:09.139 --> 00:07:12.819
And now was living in a little shack that he had built on his property.

00:07:12.819 --> 00:07:16.980
A little shack made out of bamboo and a tin roof.

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:22.300
The brother when he approached our brother who was living there in his little shack with his family,

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:29.300
he asked how he was doing and then he told them that he was happy to see that he was alive and that he was safe.

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:33.220
And then he asked the brother, and how are you two daughters?

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:38.180
And the brother replied, well, they're both safe and alive.

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:45.699
And so our visiting brother said to him, well, how thankful you can feel to know that your daughters are safe and alive.

00:07:45.699 --> 00:07:51.899
You know, I just lost my little two-year-old daughter from an illness.

00:07:51.899 --> 00:07:54.860
It's brought great grief to me and to my wife.

00:07:54.860 --> 00:08:02.100
But we are able to overcome this grief because we've decided to increase our service to Jehovah.

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:06.939
And just be able to now go out and visit the brothers who are victims of the earthquake.

00:08:06.939 --> 00:08:09.740
This is being so encouraging to me.

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:16.899
And our brother there, when he heard this expression, his eyes filled with tears.

00:08:16.899 --> 00:08:24.660
And he said he was determined now that he was going to regain his spiritual routine.

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:34.340
There are many innumerable experiences on behalf of our brothers, but it shows their confidence in their in Jehovah and their love for one another.

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:40.100
And this is something that we are able to experience even here in Bethel.

00:08:40.139 --> 00:08:47.659
It shows us that what Jehovah promises in Psalm 94 verses 18 and 19 is being fulfilled.

00:08:47.659 --> 00:08:59.620
Jehovah is soothing and comforting each one of his servants, even though many of these servants feel that they have lost everything.

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:01.059
Well, that is just wonderful.

00:09:01.059 --> 00:09:06.179
And it really just confirms what we know about the spirit of our brothers.

00:09:06.179 --> 00:09:08.580
Ed, our hearts are with you.

00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:11.940
Please give our love to all the brothers in Mexico.

00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:20.100
We'll be continuing to pray for you and we so much appreciate everything that you're doing for our brothers in that in that land.

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:24.899
And thank you for the interest of the organization and our brothers.

00:09:24.899 --> 00:09:27.940
Well, now let's go on to the France branch.

00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:32.340
You may know that France looks after several of the islands in the Caribbean.

00:09:32.419 --> 00:09:38.500
So we have live with us, brother Patrick De Coupair, who serves on the France branch committee.

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:41.539
Now, Patrick, it's very good to see you as well.

00:09:41.539 --> 00:09:44.740
We understand that you have recently been in the Caribbean.

00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:46.820
You've just recently come back.

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:54.379
And so could you give us a first hand update of what's actually happening to our brothers there?

00:09:54.379 --> 00:10:00.299
As you know, Mark, France branch is taking care of some islands of this area.

00:10:00.299 --> 00:10:06.059
Guadeloupe, Martinique, San Bartellini, San Martins.

00:10:06.059 --> 00:10:13.340
And since the first hurricane, we're also working very close with Barbados branch committee

00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:19.820
in order to support and make a joint efforts of some of the islands that they are also overseer

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:24.379
and that have been affected by the Hurricane Irma.

00:10:24.379 --> 00:10:28.460
But the real emergency was the island of San Martins.

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:34.059
There was a need to contact the brothers to provide food, water,

00:10:34.059 --> 00:10:36.700
and also to set up a disaster relief,

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:40.539
but most important to bring some spiritual comfort.

00:10:40.539 --> 00:10:43.179
So very soon, a group of brothers have been made,

00:10:43.179 --> 00:10:47.740
doctors, nurses, some construction servants, and others from the branch.

00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:54.379
And this group was able to fly into the islands of San Martins on September 11.

00:10:54.379 --> 00:10:59.419
We were some of the first ones to be allowed to enter the island

00:10:59.419 --> 00:11:03.500
after the military and the police.

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:07.179
And prior to departure to San Martins,

00:11:07.179 --> 00:11:12.539
the branch invited the congregations in Guadeloupe and Martinique

00:11:12.539 --> 00:11:16.139
to bring food and water to their assembly halls.

00:11:16.139 --> 00:11:21.820
And the first container of food and water was able to leave Guadeloupe on September 10

00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:27.419
and to arrive the same day as us on September 11.

00:11:27.419 --> 00:11:34.539
So the brothers knew that we were coming as a group from the branch with a container.

00:11:34.539 --> 00:11:39.740
So arrangements were made so we can meet at the Kingdom Hall the next day.

00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:43.259
And there, Martin, that was something I will never forget

00:11:43.259 --> 00:11:47.740
is the day that we have met for the first time our brothers and sisters

00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:51.899
and we were able to talk with them to see how they were feeling,

00:11:51.899 --> 00:11:58.700
acting, to see their heart for Jehovah and how calms they were and how spiritual.

00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:02.860
So we were waiting on for the container to be delivered at the harbor.

00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:07.820
But while well thing, everybody decided to clean the Kingdom Hall

00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:11.019
and to put it into operation.

00:12:11.019 --> 00:12:18.700
So finally, the container was delivered and in less than five hours,

00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:22.940
almost ten tons of food and water was distributed.

00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:29.100
We were able to bring it to the Kingdom Hall and to deliver it to the friends the same day.

00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:34.220
And that was done despite massive distractions on the islands

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:40.779
and many difficulties to move on this island because of lack of transportation.

00:12:41.899 --> 00:12:47.259
The next day, some medical attention was given to our friends in the island.

00:12:47.259 --> 00:12:49.980
Some shepherding work was started with the elders.

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:57.259
Meetings were conducted with the elders and presided by branch committee members

00:12:57.259 --> 00:13:00.860
of both French brands and Barbados branch.

00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:04.860
This is how Mark Huffings were started on the island of Saint-Martins.

00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:08.779
Well, Patrick, it's just wonderful to hear this.

00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:12.379
Not only that you're getting the relief aid out to the brothers,

00:13:12.379 --> 00:13:16.220
but that you're also focused on looking after their spiritual needs.

00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:18.139
It's so encouraging to hear.

00:13:18.139 --> 00:13:23.419
But Patrick, is there something that has been especially encouraging for you

00:13:23.419 --> 00:13:25.259
that you might want to share with our brothers?

00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:30.059
Well, we have many experiences that one of them,

00:13:30.059 --> 00:13:35.259
but truly impressed us very much in our group was the reaction of our brothers and sisters.

00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:39.100
How calm they were, how ready they were to move,

00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:41.980
and just wait a direction from Jehovah's organization.

00:13:42.779 --> 00:13:47.259
I also remember some sisters who were living nearby the kingdom hall.

00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:49.980
They saw some activities going on at the kingdom.

00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:52.059
Also, they decided to come to help.

00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:58.620
And they were so happy to see their brothers and sisters for the first time after the hurricane.

00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:00.539
They faces changes.

00:14:00.539 --> 00:14:02.379
They were smiling and happy.

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:06.779
We were also very impressed when we talked with the elders

00:14:06.779 --> 00:14:09.820
to see how much they have done to help their brothers and sisters.

00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:15.740
Despite their own conditions, because some of them lost their homes, their houses,

00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:19.100
they took the time, the energy, to visit their friends,

00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:21.659
to comfort them and to bring the food.

00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:27.899
Really, these elders are a hidden place from the wind and a place of

00:14:27.899 --> 00:14:32.700
concealment from the rainstorm, according to Isaiah chapter 32 verse 2.

00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:39.340
It was also amazing to see the trust of our brothers and sisters in Jehovah's organization.

00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:47.179
Before we leave, one elder told me, we knew Jehovah something would be done by Jehovah.

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:54.940
But we didn't know how, but your visit and the first container was the answer to our prayer.

00:14:54.940 --> 00:15:01.179
So many of our brothers and sisters have developed enormous confidants in Jehovah's organization

00:15:01.179 --> 00:15:02.539
are very thankful for that.

00:15:03.659 --> 00:15:07.740
And if I may, Mark, I would like to share with you one experience.

00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:09.580
Yes, please.

00:15:10.779 --> 00:15:16.220
Yeah, it's an experience that occurs the first time we went in a service.

00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:22.940
Two sisters were visiting a lady, a lady who was studying the Bible with us

00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:25.580
and also comes to the meetings on a regular basis.

00:15:26.379 --> 00:15:33.500
And while the sisters were visiting this lady, a elder came and gave her some relief food.

00:15:34.059 --> 00:15:37.019
So we can imagine how happy the lady was.

00:15:37.019 --> 00:15:40.860
That she was not happy for only for her food, but for something more.

00:15:41.419 --> 00:15:43.419
And so she explained to the sisters why.

00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:49.580
The day before, one of her neighbors told her, but she will never get any help from Jehovah's

00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:53.340
witnesses because she was not baptized as one of Jehovah's witnesses.

00:15:54.059 --> 00:15:58.940
But she said to her neighbor, Jehovah will not forget me.

00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:02.620
And I know this is the true organization so she defended Jehovah's name.

00:16:03.259 --> 00:16:07.659
And now with this bag of food in her hand, she could say to her neighbor,

00:16:07.659 --> 00:16:08.860
I can testify.

00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:13.100
I have seen that Jehovah's witnesses are true Christians.

00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:21.740
So that reminds me of this thought found in 2nd Corinthians chapter 1 verse 3,

00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:27.419
where we say that Jehovah is a god of comfort, but not only of comfort, a god of tundra

00:16:27.419 --> 00:16:29.740
of mercies.

00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:35.179
And verse 4 mentions that he also used people to comfort others.

00:16:35.179 --> 00:16:40.220
And really this is what happened during that immediate relief need.

00:16:40.299 --> 00:16:44.379
Jehovah has used some of our brothers and sisters to comfort others.

00:16:45.179 --> 00:16:50.539
And when leaving our brothers and sisters, and you can imagine how hard it was to leave them

00:16:50.539 --> 00:16:57.899
on this island, we really had the feeling that Jehovah is taking care of all his servants,

00:16:57.899 --> 00:17:02.299
all his servants, even in this remote, tiny islands.

00:17:04.059 --> 00:17:08.299
Patrick, thank you so much for that very, very encouraging report.

00:17:08.299 --> 00:17:12.940
And also thank you for being willing to make the effort to travel to the Caribbean,

00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:17.660
to those islands to visit our brothers and make sure that they're so well cared for.

00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:21.259
We wish you Jehovah's blessing, and we're going to be praying for you,

00:17:21.259 --> 00:17:26.059
and please pass on our love to all of the brothers that you are looking after.

00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:30.140
Many thanks, and this will be done for sure.

00:17:32.599 --> 00:17:35.240
Now we're going to go and move on to the United States.

00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:39.160
We have a Brother Gary Brow with us from the United States Branch Committee.

00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:43.960
Gary, we know that the United States has been hard hit by these disasters.

00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:47.160
Can you give us a little bit of an update about what's taking place?

00:17:47.799 --> 00:17:49.720
Yes, thank you. I'd be happy to do so.

00:17:50.759 --> 00:17:57.000
Hurricane Harvey hit the state of Texas and caused quite a bit of damage, significant damage,

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:03.799
actually. And then there were Hurricane's Irma and Maria, and they did terrible damage in the

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:10.599
Caribbean islands, as well as in Florida and in Georgia. In fact, thus far it's reported that

00:18:10.599 --> 00:18:19.000
a total of 184 kingdom halls have been damaged, and over 6,000 homes of the friends have been

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:26.119
damaged. But Mark, I can assure you one thing, that brothers are working 24 hours a day to

00:18:26.119 --> 00:18:35.480
be sure there is relief efforts. In fact, so far there are 975 tons of humanitarian supplies that

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:43.640
have been shipped to the various disaster areas, the use of private planes, and even some boats have

00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:50.359
been very helpful in this regard. And the United States Branch Committee has appointed disaster

00:18:50.359 --> 00:18:57.720
relief committees over these various areas, and also relief centers have been identified.

00:18:58.279 --> 00:19:05.720
Now in Texas there are seven functioning in Florida. We have four relief centers in Puerto Rico,

00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:11.720
because of the tremendous damage there. We have nine relief centers, and in the Virgin Islands

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:16.759
there are five, one for each of the islands that have been affected. Now there are hundreds of

00:19:16.759 --> 00:19:23.000
brothers working in these relief centers right now. Soon there's going to be thousands working

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:28.759
from these centers. You know, it's just amazing, Gary, to hear what you've accomplished in such a

00:19:28.759 --> 00:19:34.119
short time to, you know, mobilize everyone and get these relief centers set up. It's just wonderful

00:19:34.119 --> 00:19:40.599
to hear that. But now I also understand that you just recently went to the Caribbean to actually

00:19:40.599 --> 00:19:44.519
visit the brothers and see what's happening. Can you tell us a little bit about what you saw?

00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:50.519
Yes, that was the brother that owns a plane. He's a pilot, and another pilot was with him that

00:19:50.519 --> 00:19:57.160
picked out four of us in Florida, and we flew down to Puerto Rico. Then from Puerto Rico, with

00:19:57.160 --> 00:20:05.960
this small plane, we were able to go to St. Thomas, get into St. Croix, Tartola, and then with a boat,

00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:14.119
get over into the island of St. John. And it was heartwarming to make these trips because when we

00:20:14.119 --> 00:20:19.720
would get on the island, there would be many brothers and sisters there to receive us. And

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:25.559
these friends, Mark, have gone through some very difficult times. And there's situations

00:20:26.279 --> 00:20:33.000
right now, in some cases, is really critical. But you could see the pain in their eyes

00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:41.400
and on their faces. But they had big smiles every one of them. They were so happy to see

00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:46.920
brothers that come to them that was giving them hope that help is going to be there.

00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:52.200
In fact, you remind me of the Apostle Paul when he was on the way to Rome. In fact, they were

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:58.440
taking him to prison. And about 46 miles before he got into Rome, there was a group of brothers

00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:04.839
that put forth great effort to be there to greet him. And then 10 miles further, there's another

00:21:04.839 --> 00:21:11.559
group that put effort to meet him. And here's what the result of it was Acts 28, 15 says,

00:21:11.559 --> 00:21:20.039
on catching sight of them, Paul thanked God and took courage. I really feel these visits

00:21:20.039 --> 00:21:25.559
accomplished the same thing for these dear friends to encourage them to carry on.

00:21:26.359 --> 00:21:30.759
Absolutely. Thank you so much for being willing to go. And we wish we could have been with you

00:21:30.839 --> 00:21:37.240
on that trip. But I wonder, we were just hungry to know a little bit more. Could you tell us

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:42.359
maybe about one of the stops that you made and what you actually saw while you were with the

00:21:42.359 --> 00:21:49.079
brothers? Yeah, there are so many heartwarming experiences. One was on the island of Tartola.

00:21:49.079 --> 00:21:54.680
They have one kingdom hall that serves the four congregations. And it's been the center of

00:21:54.920 --> 00:22:02.920
worship there for decades. But it was demolished by the winds. It just did great damage on the kingdom

00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:11.640
hall. In fact, it's unsafe to enter. This kingdom hall has been a wonderful place to bring people

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:18.200
together to search a whole of God. But now tell you what's happening. Many of the friends will come

00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:25.640
to the kingdom hall and they'll sit in the parking lot all day long and in the afternoon before

00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:31.400
curfew they go back to their homes. Now, why are they doing that? Well, they have full trust that

00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:37.799
Jehovah's organization is going to provide assistance for them and it will probably start right at

00:22:37.799 --> 00:22:43.720
the kingdom hall. Now, we were really touched by this and it was apparent that we needed to do

00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:51.480
something. So steps are underway already to repair the kingdom halls. So those brothers and sisters

00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:56.920
will have a place for their worship. It also will serve as a relief center for the area.

00:22:57.559 --> 00:23:02.599
That's absolutely wonderful. Gary, I know you're just filled with experiences. There's so much

00:23:02.599 --> 00:23:06.839
that you could tell us. But just before we conclude, is there something else that you could share

00:23:06.839 --> 00:23:13.640
with us? Well, the living conditions are very difficult on the islands. The brothers

00:23:13.799 --> 00:23:21.079
and sisters are doing a wonderful job supporting one another. There's in many cases

00:23:22.119 --> 00:23:29.559
very little food and water, no running water in many places. But they're coming together and they're

00:23:29.559 --> 00:23:37.160
assisting one another until the supplies arrive. There's also something that's really touched me

00:23:38.039 --> 00:23:43.799
and that's the work that the circuit of this year has been doing in connection with all of the

00:23:43.799 --> 00:23:53.880
disasters. These brothers really are involved in a relief ministry now and it's heartwarming to

00:23:53.880 --> 00:24:00.359
see their resolve to stay with their circuits during these hurricanes and to be there to provide

00:24:00.359 --> 00:24:06.279
spiritual assistance immediately afterwards and also to be on hand to work with the elders to

00:24:06.359 --> 00:24:12.359
provide a relief also. I'd like to tell you a little bit about Puerto Rico. When we arrived there,

00:24:12.359 --> 00:24:18.200
we wanted to meet with all of the circuit of this year. There are 19 of them. But there's very little

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:24.359
communication. The phones are down, no electricity, of course. But we worked hard to try to get a

00:24:24.359 --> 00:24:29.799
message the best way we can that we could to the circuit of this year's. Really, we thought maybe

00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:38.519
three or four would show up. Believe it or not, 13 were able to make their way to the facility there

00:24:38.519 --> 00:24:47.160
in Puerto Rico. It was touching to be with them, watching their love and their determination to

00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:51.640
stay in their assignments and to work along with the disaster relief committees and the

00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:56.440
elders in their congregation in their circuits. We really encouraged the brothers.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:04.680
Remember Hebrews 111. Help the brothers to maintain their faith and don't allow the circumstances

00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:13.160
around them to weaken their faith because that will, that faith produces hope. And these dear ones

00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:19.799
have full hope in Jehovah's organization that they will provide, we will provide the assistance for

00:25:19.799 --> 00:25:26.519
them. That meeting, I will say, was quite electric. It was a parent Jehovah's Holy Spirit was there

00:25:26.519 --> 00:25:34.279
with all of these brothers. And you could see the brothers were resolved to stay in their assignments,

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:40.759
to work along with the relief committees and to work along with the elders in their various

00:25:40.759 --> 00:25:45.559
circuits. And as a result of that, and knowing the backing of the branch committee,

00:25:46.359 --> 00:25:51.319
we feel the brothers there are in good hands. Jehovah's going to take care of them.

00:25:52.519 --> 00:25:58.440
We encourage them to continue putting forth their great effort. And we know Jehovah's going to

00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:04.759
bless them as he has up to this point. In fact, we know there's going to need an army of workers

00:26:04.759 --> 00:26:11.559
mark to accomplish what has to be done. The brothers also have contributed financially and that's

00:26:11.559 --> 00:26:19.160
really beautiful to see. In fact, just recently, over 200 generators have been donated for the

00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:25.559
brothers down there. In addition to our financial support and those that have the physical energy that

00:26:25.559 --> 00:26:32.440
can do the manual labor, we can all keep these dear brothers and sisters in our prayers.

00:26:33.559 --> 00:26:39.160
You know, Gary, just hearing your report, it's amazing to consider how much of the branch

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:44.440
territory has been affected. And yet, it's amazing to see how well organized you are,

00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:48.680
and that you're getting the help out to the brothers right away. And I think what stood out in

00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:53.400
what you said to me is the faith that our brothers in spite of the fact they're going through this

00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:57.960
difficult time, they're keeping their faith strong and that the brothers are caring for their

00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:02.920
spiritual needs. And thank you so much for that report. And thank you for being willing to go

00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:08.119
and visit the brothers. Please convey our love to them and let them know that we're continuing to

00:27:08.119 --> 00:27:11.000
pray for them. Thank you for the privilege and we certainly will.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:18.599
Well, finally, we'd like to speak with a brother from the coordinators committee,

00:27:18.599 --> 00:27:24.119
Brother Bram Siegel, who works in the coordinators committee office. Brother Siegel also visited the

00:27:24.119 --> 00:27:29.559
Caribbean with Brother Bro. Now, Bram, we're so grateful that you were willing to make that trip.

00:27:29.559 --> 00:27:34.279
Can you give us a little bit of information about what you saw and what your impressions were?

00:27:35.079 --> 00:27:40.440
Yes, even though our visits were brief, it was very encouraging just to get to be with the

00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:47.240
brothers and sisters in Puerto Rico and St. Thomas and St. John. And you know, as we hear about

00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:52.599
different disasters that occur around the world, we all pray for one another. And I must say just

00:27:52.599 --> 00:27:58.359
being able to be there and meet the friends, the brothers and sisters there, to hear their stories

00:27:58.359 --> 00:28:04.759
firsthand, to cry with them. It was just very encouraging. It was really just such a privilege to

00:28:04.759 --> 00:28:11.079
be there with them. When we arrived to Puerto Rico on our way to the Bethel facility, there were

00:28:11.079 --> 00:28:16.200
trees that were down on the streets, debris in the roads. In fact, I recall when we got off

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:21.960
the exit at one point, the traffic was actually coming our way because they couldn't cross

00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:27.880
in view of the debris. When we got to the Bethel there, there were trees that were strewn about

00:28:28.359 --> 00:28:34.200
in fact, as we pulled up to Bethel, there was a commercial car wash that had been blown into the

00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:40.359
gates of Bethel. But by the time, just a few days later, when we were leaving, the Bethel family

00:28:40.359 --> 00:28:46.279
had worked really hard. They were cleaning up the property and from the outside, it was as if

00:28:46.279 --> 00:28:52.920
the hurricane hadn't had done much damage after all. It really worked hard. When we went to the

00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:58.119
island of St. Thomas, we were able to go to one of the kingdom halls there. It was on the weekend,

00:28:58.119 --> 00:29:03.960
so congregation meetings were coming and going and beginning and ending. When we arrived,

00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:11.240
the brothers and sisters had set up a little table with signs. One was saying a rooming this way

00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:16.200
and damage that way. They were organizing the brothers and sisters, just trying to see what did

00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:22.200
they need? How could they be helped? What was really encouraging to me was regarding the rooming,

00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:27.640
it was not just for the brothers and sisters who had been displaced locally, but it was also because

00:29:28.039 --> 00:29:32.920
they had confidence. They had faith that Jehovah's organization would be coming, brothers would

00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:37.640
be coming to help with reconstruction and they wanted to be prepared so that they could respond

00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:42.599
in their own way. It was just so faith-strengthening. We asked some of the friends about it,

00:29:43.559 --> 00:29:49.480
why did they do that? How did they know that help was coming? One sister said, we know that Jehovah

00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:53.559
will take care of us and just had that faith, that confidence. It was very encouraging.

00:29:53.799 --> 00:30:00.200
From there, we were able to take a ferry to St. John, the island there, and meet with the

00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:05.640
brothers. They had such a warm spirit. As some of the other brothers mentioned, even though they're

00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:10.680
dealing with a lot individually, they are still interested in caring for one another,

00:30:11.319 --> 00:30:18.039
pooling together funds for fuel or even what food they had they're sharing together

00:30:18.119 --> 00:30:23.640
until more supplies can come. It was just so encouraging to see that family atmosphere,

00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:28.920
that spirit that they were showing toward one another. Really, that's what stood out to me the most

00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:36.119
in visiting the brothers and sisters in these different areas. They were not so focused on

00:30:36.119 --> 00:30:42.359
themselves. They were still very interested in their brothers and sisters. Even beyond the island

00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:47.559
they were on, but around the earth. In fact, when we went to Puerto Rico, they were asking,

00:30:47.559 --> 00:30:52.440
how are the brothers in St. John doing? Have you heard from them? When we were in St. John,

00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:57.319
they're asking likewise, how are the brothers in Puerto Rico doing? They were really focused on

00:30:57.319 --> 00:31:04.759
caring for one another. It brought to mind the scripture of 1 Corinthians 12 verses 25 and 26.

00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:10.839
They have that mutual concern for one another. If one member of the body suffers,

00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:16.920
all the members suffer with it and they were just really beautifully showing their love and

00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:22.680
faith in action. That's a wonderful report, Bram. Thank you so much for going and for bringing

00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:27.240
back so many of those encouraging thoughts. But now, something that many of the brothers have

00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:32.359
been asking about is our brothers in Cuba. We've heard about some of the other islands, but what's

00:31:32.359 --> 00:31:37.480
happening with our brothers in Cuba? How are they doing? Yes, we received a report from the

00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:43.000
branch in Cuba after Hurricane Irma came across the island and we're happy to report there were

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:50.279
no brothers that died or were injured. In fact, many had evacuated to the homes of other brothers

00:31:50.279 --> 00:31:56.759
or even to government shelters as needed in order to be in a safer location. The Bethel family,

00:31:56.759 --> 00:32:02.920
the facility there, they're doing fine. There wasn't any damage or injury there. As far as the

00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:10.279
property or homes of the brothers, there was quite extensive damage. Over 650 houses had major

00:32:10.279 --> 00:32:18.440
damage and over 50 were completely destroyed. There's a great need in Cuba as well. We know that

00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:23.400
getting supplies to the different islands can be challenging, including in Cuba, but the brothers

00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:30.119
are working hard to provide for them and getting supplies to them. We know that Jehovah is going to

00:32:30.119 --> 00:32:34.839
continue to bless the relief efforts that are being done and we continue to pray for all of our

00:32:34.839 --> 00:32:40.119
brothers around the world. Yes, we do. Thank you so much, Bram. Please give our love to all of the

00:32:40.119 --> 00:32:43.880
brothers and please let them know that we're praying on their behalf. Our privilege, thank you.

00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:53.799
In the midst of these major disasters, it's truly amazing to see how Jehovah's people are all

00:32:53.799 --> 00:32:59.880
rallying together to help one another. The phones have been ringing at branches all over the world.

00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:05.400
The brothers are calling. They're asking, what can we do to help? It's a wonderful spirit.

00:33:06.039 --> 00:33:13.400
Well, of course, those near the disaster areas have donated food, water, clothing, generators.

00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:18.359
It's just faith strengthening to see the brothers coming to the aid of one another.

00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:26.519
But we're also able to tell you today and we're very happy to do so that already some three

00:33:26.519 --> 00:33:32.119
million dollars have been sent from your generous contributions in order to care for the

00:33:32.119 --> 00:33:39.720
immediate needs of our brothers in these various areas. However, this is just the beginning.

00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:47.079
The governing body believes that we will need to spend an additional 20 to 25 million dollars

00:33:47.079 --> 00:33:53.160
in order to help the brothers recover from these disasters. Well, many are saying, we're not

00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:57.960
close enough to donate water and food and so on. And they want to know, what can we do?

00:33:58.759 --> 00:34:04.839
Well, brothers and sisters, we can all help by making a donation to the worldwide work

00:34:04.839 --> 00:34:11.719
using the contribution box at our own kingdom hall. Or we can even make a donation via the JW.org

00:34:11.719 --> 00:34:20.840
website. But most important, we can all pray on behalf of our brothers. Now, sometimes we hear our

00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:30.039
brothers say, I can't do that much. All I can do is pray. But in reality, prayer is not a small

00:34:30.039 --> 00:34:37.639
thing. It is the greatest thing we can do because we have confidence that Jehovah hears the prayers

00:34:37.639 --> 00:34:44.599
of righteous ones. We know that our brothers in these disaster regions are going through a very

00:34:44.599 --> 00:34:52.920
difficult time. But what is our confidence? Well, it's really what stated here in Psalm 46 and

00:34:52.920 --> 00:35:04.199
verse 1. It says, God is our refuge and strength, a hope that is readily found in times of distress.

00:35:05.159 --> 00:35:11.639
That is why we will not fear, though the earth undergoes change, though the mountains topple

00:35:11.639 --> 00:35:19.239
into the depths of the sea, though its waters roar and foam over, though the mountains rock

00:35:19.239 --> 00:35:30.280
on account of its turbulence. And then verse 5. God is in the city. It cannot be overthrown. God will

00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:40.329
come to its aid at the break of dawn. Jehovah will certainly take care of our brothers. He is our

00:35:40.409 --> 00:35:49.690
refuge and strength. We have no reason to be afraid. He is a help that is easily found in times of

00:35:49.690 --> 00:35:57.210
distress. You can be confident that the governing body will continue to do everything in our power

00:35:57.210 --> 00:36:04.650
to provide the needed relief aid to our dear brothers in these affected areas. We love you very

00:36:04.650 --> 00:36:12.570
much and thank you for tuning in for this update. This is JW Broadcasting from the World Headquarters

00:36:12.570 --> 00:36:20.489
of Jehovah's Witnesses.
