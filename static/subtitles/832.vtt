00:00:01.679 --> 00:00:10.599
At Matthew 13, verse 52, Jesus said that every public instructor was like a man with a treasure

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:15.640
store filled with truths, old and new.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:22.719
Well, we know that's true, and if it's true, it means that this audience are among the

00:00:22.719 --> 00:00:26.640
most rich people in the entire world.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:34.600
You have a large treasure store of truths, both old and new.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:41.880
But here's the question, what will you do with your treasure store?

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:53.100
Now a Deuteronomy, chapter 29, and verse 29, Moses gave these words, he said,

00:00:53.100 --> 00:01:04.219
the things concealed belong to Jehovah our God, but the things revealed belong to us and

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:12.939
to our descendants forever so that we may carry out all the words of this law.

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:15.420
Well, there's a fundamental truth there.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:22.900
You see, the truth never solely belongs to us, but rather, it also belongs to our

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:29.019
descendants to all of our sons and daughters who are to come.

00:01:29.019 --> 00:01:38.019
Well, that means that as men and women of faith, we have a clear responsibility to share,

00:01:38.019 --> 00:01:43.859
to pass on the wonderful truths that we have come to know with the next generation.

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:46.859
Well, the Bible emphasizes this.

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:58.450
Let's read that what the Psalmist said in Psalm 78 and verse 3, Psalm 78, verse 3,

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:05.569
it says, the things we have heard and know, which our fathers have related to us, we will

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:08.729
not hide from their sons.

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:16.449
We will relate to the generation to come, the praiseworthy deeds of Jehovah and his strength,

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:21.330
the wonderful things that he has done.

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:27.409
Well now, this includes more than just the basic truths.

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:33.169
It also includes all of the wonderful things that we've been taught by other brothers

00:02:33.169 --> 00:02:41.169
and sisters, all the experiences that we've had in experiencing the hand of Jehovah in

00:02:41.169 --> 00:02:43.090
our own lives.

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:50.169
So Jehovah took the matter of passing this on to the next generation very seriously because

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:58.250
look at what it says in verse 5, it says he established a reminder in Jacob and set a

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.409
law in Israel.

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:07.250
He commanded our forefathers to make these things known to their children so that the next

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:12.530
generation, the children yet to be born might know them.

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.729
They in turn would relate them to their children.

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:24.250
Well, brothers and sisters, especially those of you who have so much wisdom and experience,

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:31.930
do you feel that responsibility to share what you have with the generation to come?

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:40.409
Well, if we get the sense of Deuteronomy 29, 29 and Psalm 78, well then we will do this.

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:46.770
We will share what we have with the next generation, but how do we do it?

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:51.169
Well, of course, this process begins with all of our parents.

00:03:51.169 --> 00:03:58.770
And by their following, the command in Deuteronomy 6, verses 6 and 7, to teach their children as

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:06.969
they sit in the house, as they walk on the road when they lie down and when they get up.

00:04:06.969 --> 00:04:11.650
But the process does not end with the Christian parents.

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:21.970
We also have a responsibility to teach and train young adults so that they can take on responsibility

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.610
in Jehovah's congregation.

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:30.649
Now the Bible is filled with examples of individuals who are wonderful trainers.

00:04:30.649 --> 00:04:34.569
Maybe one who comes to mind right away is Moses.

00:04:34.569 --> 00:04:38.689
It seems like in the Bible, whenever you see Moses, you see Joshua.

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:41.009
They're always together.

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:47.129
Can you imagine the wonderful training that Moses was able to impart to Joshua as they

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:51.810
work together for more than 40 years?

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:57.009
It's not only told Joshua, but he also showed him.

00:04:57.009 --> 00:05:01.810
And by being with him, he was able to observe his fine example.

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:08.810
Well when the time was ready, when Moses was ready to hand over the responsibility, notice

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:16.980
what he says here in Deuteronomy 31 and verse 7.

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:24.779
He says, Moses then called Joshua and said to him before the eyes of all Israel, be courageous

00:05:24.779 --> 00:05:30.540
and strong for you are the one who will bring this people into the land that Jehovah swore

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:36.819
to their forefathers to give to them and you will give it to them as an inheritance.

00:05:36.819 --> 00:05:41.620
Jehovah is the one marching before you and he will continue with you.

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:44.860
He will neither desert you nor abandon you.

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:48.420
Do not be afraid or be terrified.

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:55.379
Well, can you imagine how Moses must have felt to say those words to this young man who

00:05:55.379 --> 00:05:59.980
he had worked so hard all of these years with?

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:03.899
Well, that's not the only example that's in the scriptures.

00:06:03.899 --> 00:06:06.620
What about Paul and Timothy?

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:12.259
We know that Timothy was probably in his late teens or early 20s when Paul met him at

00:06:12.259 --> 00:06:13.259
Listera.

00:06:13.259 --> 00:06:14.939
What did Paul do?

00:06:14.939 --> 00:06:21.980
He took that young man along with him on his tours, going from congregation to congregation.

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:24.819
He put him in mind of his methods.

00:06:24.819 --> 00:06:26.819
He taught him.

00:06:26.819 --> 00:06:34.500
And as a result, Timothy came to be a solid, mature Christian man who was able to strengthen

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:36.939
the congregations of God's people.

00:06:36.939 --> 00:06:41.819
Do you remember what Paul said about him in Philippians chapter 2?

00:06:41.819 --> 00:06:44.620
It's quite a recommendation.

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:49.579
Philippians chapter 2 and verse 20.

00:06:49.579 --> 00:07:00.060
Paul said, for I have no one else of a disposition like his who will genuinely care for your concerns.

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:03.339
What a tremendous recommendation.

00:07:03.339 --> 00:07:09.420
But because Paul had invested that time into Timothy, he knew the fine qualities that

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:11.180
young man had.

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:18.259
Well, Paul not only wanted Timothy to take that training himself, but you'll recall that

00:07:18.259 --> 00:07:25.939
in 2 Timothy chapter 2, he gave advice to Timothy as to what he was to do with all of that

00:07:25.939 --> 00:07:28.819
fine training that he had received.

00:07:28.819 --> 00:07:36.459
Timothy chapter 2 and verse 2, Paul said, and the things you heard from me that were

00:07:36.459 --> 00:07:45.860
supported by many witnesses, these things in trust to faithful men who in turn will be

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:49.699
adequately qualified to teach others.

00:07:49.699 --> 00:07:57.939
So that training would go on to future brothers and future generations of servants of Jehovah.

00:07:57.939 --> 00:08:04.180
Paul invested training in a very young man and it paid off.

00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:11.579
In our modern day, I think of brother Nathan Nor as an outstanding trainer.

00:08:11.579 --> 00:08:19.540
When he became the president of the Watchtower Society in January of 1942, he was only 36

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:21.300
years old.

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:27.860
Now he could have thought, I'm so young, I have many, many years ahead of me.

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:33.500
To be able to care for matters and so there really isn't any need to train others.

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:37.100
But brother Nor did not have that disposition.

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:41.139
He was a trainer even at that young age.

00:08:41.139 --> 00:08:49.580
He assigned brother Milton Henshel who was in his mid-twenties to be his secretary.

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:55.019
Brother Nor took brother Henshel with him on his travels all over the world to branches

00:08:55.019 --> 00:08:58.820
and missionary homes to strengthen the brothers.

00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:07.500
He had him right by his side at major conventions, not just telling him, but showing him how to

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:09.379
take the lead.

00:09:09.379 --> 00:09:12.940
And brother Henshel absorbed that training.

00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:19.940
By 1947, he was a member of the Board of Directors of the Watchtower Society, only 27 years

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:25.779
old, and he went on to serve as a member of the governing body.

00:09:25.779 --> 00:09:30.620
Brother Nor trained other young brothers like Don Adams.

00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:38.940
This photo that we're about to show was taken at a gathering on brother Adams 70th anniversary

00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:41.500
in full-time service.

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:47.779
Now here you see other, a group of young men that brother Nor had trained, Robert Wallen,

00:09:47.779 --> 00:09:53.419
Charles Mollahan, Davidson Claire, and Don Adams.

00:09:53.419 --> 00:09:58.460
All of these men were identified when they were very young and they worked together for

00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:01.899
more than 50 years faithfully.

00:10:01.899 --> 00:10:07.220
Jehovah helped brother Nor to choose very well.

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:09.460
But it didn't end there.

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:14.820
Brother Nor also appointed well-qualified young brothers who were gillian graduates to

00:10:14.899 --> 00:10:17.899
assignments with great responsibility.

00:10:17.899 --> 00:10:24.419
For example, brother Kenneth Little was assigned to be the branch servant in Canada when he

00:10:24.419 --> 00:10:27.259
was 34 years old.

00:10:27.259 --> 00:10:32.740
Brother Denton Hopkinson was assigned as the branch servant in the Philippines when he

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:35.740
was 33 years old.

00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:43.419
And brother Richard Kelsey was assigned as the branch servant in Germany when he was 38.

00:10:43.419 --> 00:10:49.100
When appointed, brother Kelsey said to brother Nor, but I'm only 38.

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:55.879
And brother Nor said, well, yeah, that's about the age I was when I became president.

00:10:55.879 --> 00:10:59.120
Brother Nor once again had chosen well.

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:04.679
Those last three brothers are all still serving on the branch committees in their respective

00:11:04.679 --> 00:11:10.600
lands and are all members of the Watchtower Bible and Track Society of Pennsylvania who

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:12.759
were tied in today for this meeting.

00:11:12.759 --> 00:11:28.899
Isn't that wonderful?

00:11:28.899 --> 00:11:30.860
But there's a lesson here, brothers.

00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:32.740
There's a lesson.

00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:37.820
Brother Nor expressed confidence in humble young brothers.

00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:45.299
He allowed them to take on responsibility and that proved to be a wonderful blessing for

00:11:45.299 --> 00:11:46.940
Jehovah's people.

00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:53.419
Well, what's the lesson then for elders, for circuit overseers, for branch committee

00:11:53.419 --> 00:11:59.460
members, really, for all mature brothers in the congregation?

00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:07.019
We must actively be training and teaching the next generation of ministerial servants,

00:12:07.019 --> 00:12:12.580
the next generation of elders, the next generation of circuit overseers.

00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:21.299
And we must take this responsibility seriously because the truth belongs not just to us.

00:12:21.299 --> 00:12:25.820
It also belongs to our sons, to our descendants.

00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:35.019
We must pass on the truth, the wisdom, the experience that we have in our treasure store to these

00:12:35.019 --> 00:12:41.820
next Joshua's, these next Timothy's that Jehovah will raise up.

00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:44.419
But now that's the role of the trainers.

00:12:44.419 --> 00:12:49.580
What is the role of you younger brothers who are listening to this program?

00:12:50.139 --> 00:12:56.980
Well, it's your responsibility to work hard to meet the scriptural qualifications for ministerial

00:12:56.980 --> 00:13:00.419
servants and later for elders.

00:13:00.419 --> 00:13:03.379
Seek out training.

00:13:03.379 --> 00:13:05.019
Ask for advice.

00:13:05.019 --> 00:13:06.779
Ask for counsel.

00:13:06.779 --> 00:13:14.379
Be eager to learn from older brothers who are rich in wisdom and experience.

00:13:14.379 --> 00:13:19.259
Now to help you grow, those brothers may give you some counsel.

00:13:19.259 --> 00:13:22.779
They may even correct you from time to time.

00:13:22.779 --> 00:13:26.860
Will you love them for doing that?

00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:33.740
Like Jacob who wrestled with an angel to receive a blessing, you too may have to wrestle.

00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:40.700
You may have to struggle at times to get that blessing, to reach that goal.

00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:47.740
But if you work hard and if you look to Jehovah for his help, you will grow spiritually.

00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:54.580
You will draw close to him and who knows what responsibilities may come to you.

00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:59.820
What is the governing body doing to support efforts to train young brothers?

00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:07.100
Well in January of this year, the governing body requested all bodies of elders worldwide

00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:12.860
to give priority to helping younger brothers grow in their relationship with Jehovah and

00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:17.940
to qualify for congregation responsibilities.

00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:23.379
Elders and circuit overseers were reminded that young brothers who apply themselves may

00:14:23.379 --> 00:14:29.460
qualify as ministerial servants in their late teens.

00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:35.340
And that an exceptional ministerial servant who has gained experience in shepherding and

00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:42.340
teaching could serve as an elder in his early twenties.

00:14:42.379 --> 00:14:50.419
Now here's another arrangement that we have not publicly announced before, but we will today.

00:14:50.419 --> 00:14:56.179
Circuit overseers have also been informed that they may invite qualified young brothers

00:14:56.179 --> 00:15:05.980
between the ages of 21 and 23 to apply to attend the school for kingdom evangelizers.

00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:10.779
Please don't all call your circuit overseer at once.

00:15:10.779 --> 00:15:14.419
But the efforts do not end there.

00:15:14.419 --> 00:15:21.539
Jehovah willing, in January 2023, the school for kingdom evangelizers will again begin

00:15:21.539 --> 00:15:25.899
functioning in person worldwide.

00:15:25.899 --> 00:15:34.820
And as we resume in person regional conventions, just imagine the joy that we'll have in seeing

00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:41.259
younger brothers get up and give their first talk at a regional convention.

00:15:41.259 --> 00:15:42.259
Won't that be wonderful?

00:15:42.259 --> 00:15:55.860
Are you looking forward to it?

00:15:55.860 --> 00:15:59.299
But the governing body has another new initiative.

00:15:59.299 --> 00:16:03.940
Governing body members will now have the possibility to take a younger brother along

00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:08.899
with them when they make shepherding visits to the branches.

00:16:08.899 --> 00:16:14.539
And appointed governing body helpers, who are headquarters representatives, will also

00:16:14.539 --> 00:16:19.980
be allowed to take a younger brother with them when they make their branch visits.

00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:26.899
These arrangements will allow many brothers to receive additional training directly from

00:16:26.899 --> 00:16:31.059
governing body members and helpers.

00:16:31.059 --> 00:16:34.779
Well what have we discussed in this brief talk?

00:16:34.779 --> 00:16:38.379
Jehovah has allowed us to know the truth.

00:16:38.379 --> 00:16:40.139
He's allowed us to be trained.

00:16:40.139 --> 00:16:46.820
He's allowed us to gain wisdom and experience from other experienced brothers and sisters.

00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:49.779
What now is our responsibility?

00:16:49.779 --> 00:16:57.980
Well, let's read it in Psalm 71 because the psalmist put it so beautifully here, Psalm 71

00:16:57.980 --> 00:17:05.339
and verse 17, Oh God, you have taught me from my youth.

00:17:05.339 --> 00:17:10.819
And until now, I keep declaring your wonderful works.

00:17:10.819 --> 00:17:15.579
Even when I am old and gray, oh God, do not abandon me.

00:17:15.579 --> 00:17:23.900
Let me tell the next generation about your power and about your mightiness to all those

00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:26.220
who are to come.

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:34.220
Dear brothers, please let us work hard to share the wonderful truths, the experience,

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:38.859
the wisdom that we have gained with the generation to come.
