00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:05.360
We have an archive interview with brother Horst Henschel.

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:11.359
He and his family face bitter persecution during World War II under Nazi Germany.

00:00:11.359 --> 00:00:18.359
After the war, he was imprisoned for his faith in the GDR, the former East Germany.

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:27.359
When at his lowest point, notice what renewed his strength to endure and keep looking ahead.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:38.500
My parents had a very strong faith in God and the Bible.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.500
Of course, Jehovah's Witnesses were banned during the Second World War.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.500
My mother was arrested and imprisoned.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:53.500
My father could not reconcile military service with his conscience and therefore he refused to do it.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:01:03.500
Until today, I can still see him sitting in front of the kitchen stove and looking in the open flames.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.500
That was the last time I saw him in the shooting.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:16.500
I had to go to school and he went to the district commando and explained them that he cannot be a soldier because of his conscience.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.500
But it's a total of four times and hingewicht.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.500
Finally, he was sentenced to death and was executed.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:30.500
So in the beginning of his last letter, he wrote,

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.500
be happy when you get his letter.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.500
Because I have endured in two hours, I will be executed.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.500
And then he ends his letter with the words,

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.500
Auf Wiedersehen.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.500
See you again.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:58.500
My mother's faith and my father's integrity and their belief in the resurrection have had a deep impact in my life.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:04.290
And I am still very grateful for that.

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:15.289
Later as a young man of 19 years, I also was arrested in the former GDR for proclaiming the Word of God.

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:23.289
I was sentenced to 12 years in prison, but I had only to serve six years.

00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:28.289
What I learned is that Jehovah really helps at the right time.

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:31.289
The time of interrogation was difficult.

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:38.289
I was put in a solitary confinement cell in a cell with only very little light.

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:41.289
I did not have any strength anymore.

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:45.289
In the cell there was not much, only a plank bed for sleeping,

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:52.289
and on the wall a board with house rules that I didn't take notice of.

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:55.289
I looked at it and I turned it around.

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:57.289
And what did I read on the bank?

00:02:57.289 --> 00:03:00.289
The lyrics of a song of our songbook.

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:02.759
It said,

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:03.759
It said,

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:04.759
Fear them not.

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:11.069
Oh, my beloved, the men's posting threats may fly.

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:15.069
Immediately, I regained my strength.

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:19.960
I felt like having been at the convention.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:28.960
Because I knew other brothers had also been here that had endured and stayed faithful.

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:32.960
Of course, I will never want to forget this incident.

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:39.960
It showed me very clearly that Jehovah really gives us the power beyond what is normal.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:43.960
It's like the Bible says,

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:46.960
The word of God exerts power.

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.960
Or, as it says in Proverbs,

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.960
The name of Jehovah is a strong tower.

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:55.960
Into it, the righteous one runs and receives protection.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.960
The greatest freedom and its sensitivity.

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:07.909
Brother Henshel's experience reminds us that spiritual food in whatever form,

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:09.909
such as a theocratic song,

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:12.909
can strengthen us to keep enduring.
