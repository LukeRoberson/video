00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:06.519
Our theme for this month's broadcast is sincere

00:00:06.519 --> 00:00:10.519
commendation is always appropriate.

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:15.519
One definition of commendation is the act of praising

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:18.519
or approving of someone.

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:22.519
And when it is given in a sincere, genuine way,

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:27.519
how encouraging it can be to the one receiving it.

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:31.519
That makes us think of Proverbs 15, 23,

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:36.520
which says, a word spoken at the right time,

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.520
how good it is.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.520
Similarly, Proverbs 12, 25 talks about how anxiety

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.520
can weigh a person's heart down,

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.520
but then says, but a good word cheers it up.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.520
A 19th century author gested,

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.520
I can live for two months on a good compliment.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.519
But now, keeping our theme in mind,

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.519
let us talk about Jehovah and Jesus.

00:01:09.519 --> 00:01:13.519
Can you imagine how much Jehovah must have appreciated

00:01:13.519 --> 00:01:18.519
His only begotten Son whom we have come to know is Jesus?

00:01:18.519 --> 00:01:22.519
Jesus had faithfully supported His Father

00:01:22.519 --> 00:01:25.519
for eons of time.

00:01:25.519 --> 00:01:28.519
But then when He learned of Jehovah's purpose

00:01:28.519 --> 00:01:31.519
to buy back the hope of everlasting life

00:01:31.519 --> 00:01:35.519
for imperfect humans, what did Jesus do?

00:01:35.519 --> 00:01:40.519
Did He make excuses as to why He could not leave heaven

00:01:40.519 --> 00:01:42.519
and come to the earth?

00:01:42.519 --> 00:01:46.519
Father, I have many projects going on

00:01:46.519 --> 00:01:49.519
and I have my friends here in heaven.

00:01:49.519 --> 00:01:53.519
And besides, I would miss being with you.

00:01:53.519 --> 00:01:56.519
I just don't have the right circumstances.

00:01:56.519 --> 00:02:00.519
Furthermore, this will be a very difficult, painful,

00:02:00.519 --> 00:02:02.519
humiliating assignment.

00:02:02.519 --> 00:02:09.520
It seems like this is a good assignment for Gabriel.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:15.520
No, Jesus did not even slightly reason this way.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.520
He willingly made sacrifices that cost Him dearly.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:25.520
He changed life forms, going from a majestic spirit creature

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:31.520
to a little baby completely dependent on His parents.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.520
Later, as a perfect child,

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:39.520
He remained fully in subjection to imperfect parents.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:44.520
Then, as an adult, He worked His heart out

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.520
in starting a preaching campaign that continues

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.520
to this very day.

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.520
You wonder how many pairs of sandals He may have worn out

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:59.520
during His three and a half year ministry.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:04.520
Then, He died an agonizing death on a torture stake

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.520
in order to provide a corresponding ransom

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.520
according to Jehovah's purpose.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:16.520
He contributed His very life to support the work

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:21.520
that Jehovah wanted accomplished at that time.

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:26.520
Undoubtedly, you recall the video that was shown

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:31.520
during the final talk of last year's regional convention.

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:36.520
It helped us better appreciate what Jesus did for us.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:41.520
By His selfless act, He opened the way for everlasting life,

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.520
whether in heaven or on earth.

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.520
But now the question is,

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:54.520
did Jehovah appreciate all that His Son did to support Him,

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:58.520
sanctifying His name and vindicating His sovereignty?

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:03.520
Absolutely. We know He did.

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:08.520
Imagine Jesus waste deep in the Jordan River.

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:12.520
His hair still dripping from His baptism.

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:17.519
He looks up and in some way sees the heavens open up

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:23.519
and God's Spirit descend like a dove and come upon Him.

00:04:23.519 --> 00:04:28.519
Then, He hears Jehovah's own voice from Heaven say,

00:04:28.519 --> 00:04:35.519
this is my Son, the beloved whom I have approved.

00:04:35.519 --> 00:04:38.519
If we think about it,

00:04:38.519 --> 00:04:44.519
Jehovah packed a lot of commendation into that one sentence.

00:04:44.519 --> 00:04:47.519
This is my Son.

00:04:47.519 --> 00:04:49.519
Jehovah, in effect, was saying,

00:04:49.519 --> 00:04:55.519
son, I am proud to be your father, the beloved.

00:04:55.519 --> 00:04:59.519
Jehovah was saying, I love you, son,

00:04:59.519 --> 00:05:02.519
whom I have approved.

00:05:02.519 --> 00:05:05.519
Jehovah was saying, I am very happy, son,

00:05:05.519 --> 00:05:08.519
with what you have done thus far.

00:05:08.519 --> 00:05:14.519
And I know I'm going to be very happy with what you will yet do.

00:05:14.519 --> 00:05:21.519
Can you imagine how good all of that commendation made Jesus feel?

00:05:21.519 --> 00:05:26.519
Yes, Jehovah appreciated all of the sacrifices Jesus had made

00:05:26.519 --> 00:05:30.519
to support what He wanted accomplished

00:05:30.519 --> 00:05:37.240
and He expressed His appreciation.

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:41.240
Jesus, being the exact reflection of His Father,

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:47.240
was also a perfect example of one who commended others.

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:51.240
As recorded at Luke 22, 28, and 29,

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:55.240
do you remember what Jesus said to His faithful 11 apostles

00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:00.240
on the last night of his life as a human?

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:06.240
You are the ones who have stuck with me in my trials.

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:11.240
And I make a covenant with you for a kingdom.

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:16.240
Warm commendation indeed.

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.240
Consider another example.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:24.240
Although Jesus provided constructive counsel to several congregations,

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:28.240
He also warmly commended them.

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:37.240
Notice what He said to the congregation in Thyatira at Revelation 2, verse 19.

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:41.240
In verse 19, Jesus said,

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:49.240
I know your deeds and your love and faith and ministry and endurance

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:56.240
and that your deeds of light are more than those you did at first.

00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:03.240
Such detailed, thoughtful commendation likely move the congregation

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:07.240
to continue making similar progress thereafter.

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:14.550
Well, now we have talked about the two best examples in the universe

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:18.550
of ones who are generous with commendation,

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:22.550
Jehovah and Jesus.

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:25.550
But now, what about us?

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:32.550
Ephesians 5.1 urges us to become imitators of God.

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:38.550
And our convention theme this past year was imitate Jesus.

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:43.550
And this counsel also applies to the governing body.

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:49.550
The governing body would like to follow Jehovah's and Jesus' good example

00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:57.550
by providing warm commendation to you, dear brothers and sisters.

00:07:57.550 --> 00:08:04.550
So many of you are so responsive to any suggestions or appeals made to you

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:08.550
by the faithful and discreet slave.

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:13.550
In the May 2015 monthly program,

00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:20.550
we shared our interest in expediting the construction of new Kingdom halls

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:23.550
and remote translation offices.

00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:28.550
And we explained some of the financial challenges we were facing

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:31.550
in being able to do so.

00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:37.549
We discerned that contributions immediately went up by more than 15%

00:08:37.549 --> 00:08:41.549
for the months of June and July.

00:08:41.549 --> 00:08:45.549
We thank you very much.

00:08:45.549 --> 00:08:53.860
Not only are older ones in Jehovah's organization responding with generosity,

00:08:53.860 --> 00:09:00.860
the governing body has been deeply touched by the response of many young ones.

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:02.860
It's just one example.

00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:09.860
I personally received a precious letter, dear brother Latt.

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:13.860
Hello, I am 13 years old.

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:19.860
The reason I wrote this letter is because of the May J. W. Broadcasting.

00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:26.860
I was motivated to contribute to the worldwide work.

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:31.860
I have been saving up and my relatives gave me some money.

00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:34.860
I hope it helps.

00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:43.860
I also want to thank you and the other governing body members for the Korean J. W. Broadcasting.

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:49.860
Now, my whole family can understand much more and benefit from it.

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:54.860
My whole family wants to appreciate all of this.

00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:57.860
Please tell the other governing body members also.

00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:01.860
And then she drew a smiley face.

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:09.860
So because you motivated me in financial ways, I was also motivated in spiritual ways.

00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:14.860
I am doing auxiliary pioneering during summer break.

00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:16.860
One more time.

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:20.860
My family and I want to say thank you.

00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:27.860
And then she drew a big red heart at the end of her letter.

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:36.860
Well, I sent the check to the Treasures office, but I'm definitely keeping her touching letter and her adorable picture.

00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:54.139
Comments such as these have moved us to want to use this January 2016 broadcast program to thank you from the bottom of our hearts for your support.

00:10:54.139 --> 00:11:00.139
And also to update you on what has happened since last May.

00:11:00.139 --> 00:11:03.139
So many good things are happening.

00:11:03.139 --> 00:11:11.860
So we ask, what has been accomplished in the past eight months?

00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:28.860
Well, we continue to finance the weekly cost to feed and house the more than 25,000 Bethel family members worldwide and to help support over 55,000 others in special full-time service.

00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:40.860
We have been able to continue to fund the huge construction project of building the World Headquarters Facility in Warwick, New York.

00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:50.860
Additionally, large branch construction and renovation projects that were underway are being supported.

00:11:50.860 --> 00:12:06.860
And around the world, considerable audio and video equipment has been purchased to show the entire program of our imitate Jesus convention on big screens or monitors.

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:16.860
Seeing the participants up close, pose our attention and enhances the learning experience.

00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:34.860
You may not realize it, but there were 52 videos and almost 30 other audio and visual aids presented during this convention, making a total of some 80 presentations for our enjoyment.

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:47.860
In addition to all of the foregoing, in the past eight months, over 2,000 Kingdom Halls have been built or are in the process of being completed.

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:57.860
That average is more than eight Kingdom Halls being built every day, which is truly amazing.

00:12:57.860 --> 00:13:08.860
Also, over 50 remote translation office facilities have been completed or are now in the process of being built.

00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:15.860
Does all of this mean, though, that we have accomplished all of our goals?

00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:33.860
You remember that in our May program, we mentioned the willing generosity of the Israelites in the wilderness when they were asked to contribute to the fabrication and construction of the tabernacle for true worship.

00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:50.860
You recall that in Exodus 35, it says that everyone whose heart impelled Him and everyone whose spirit incited Him came and brought their contribution for Jehovah.

00:13:50.860 --> 00:14:04.360
And in chapter 36 verse 7, it says, the goods were enough for all the work to be done and more than enough.

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:23.360
When we ask, were the Israelites more appreciative and responsive than we are today? No! As we said earlier, you are to be commended for your immediate generous response to the May broadcast.

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:29.360
You responded similar to the Israelites in Moses' time.

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:40.360
The difference, however, between the Israelites giving an ours today is that they only had one project to construct.

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:53.360
When it was completed, that was all it was needed. However, as you know, we have thousands of projects that need our continued support.

00:14:53.360 --> 00:15:21.360
It is not just a two-month undertaking. In fact, as announced at the annual meeting this past October, the governing body is so serious about advancing Kingdom interest in the field that we have re-analyzed ways we can cut back at all the branches, so as to redirect more funds to the field.

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:39.360
For example, many long-standing Bethel routines and services are being reduced or eliminated. This will result in fewer members of the Bethel family being required.

00:15:39.360 --> 00:16:01.360
The governing body is absolutely confident, completely confident, that this initiative and other cost-saving initiatives that we are taking coupled with your continued support will enable us to care for all the needs in the field.

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:14.360
On behalf of the governing body, I would like to borrow the inspired words of 2 Thessalonians, chapter 1, verses 3 and 4.

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:21.360
We express the words of Paul to you dear brothers and sisters.

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:40.360
We are obligated always to give thanks to God for you, brothers. This is fitting because your faith is growing exceedingly, and the love of each and every one of you is increasing toward one another.

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:54.700
As a result, we ourselves take pride in you among the congregations of God because of your endurance and faith.

00:16:54.700 --> 00:17:07.700
Again, we sincerely thank you for your generous support of Jehovah's great work in these exciting last days.
