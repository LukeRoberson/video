00:00:03.859 --> 00:00:10.859
Sitting around the fire beneath the million stars

00:00:10.859 --> 00:00:14.859
Letting go of the cares of the day we share

00:00:14.859 --> 00:00:17.859
The reflections of our heart

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:24.859
It's so nice to make the time to think of all the good

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:28.859
Daily gifts from above, how God shows us His love

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.859
Feel us with gratitude

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:42.579
We're just taking a moment to change our focus

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:53.579
Slowing down to a cup and reflect on the simple things that joy

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.579
It brings to slow down to take a deep breath

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:11.959
Poise and reset

00:01:11.959 --> 00:01:14.959
As the moon shines through the forest

00:01:14.959 --> 00:01:20.939
This of the night, our spirits are lifted

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.939
If I have a good gift of that

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:25.939
It comes from our father up high

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:28.939
As we see the big picture

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:32.799
On the trials we face

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:37.799
You and I can't endure as our hearts are yours

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.799
The whole was born and brave

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:50.069
We're just taking joy

00:01:50.069 --> 00:02:03.640
Slowing on the sands to slow down

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:29.560
To take a deep breath and reset
