00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:12.650
Many people live their entire lives without ever being affected by a natural disaster.

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:19.649
It can be easy to forget that your life can literally change overnight.

00:00:19.649 --> 00:00:47.840
Recently in California, our brothers and sisters in numerous areas have had to flee for their lives

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.840
because of firestorms coming in right behind them.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:57.840
Literally, for some, it was within minutes racing for their lives, either in their car, some on foot

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.840
with flames, towering flames, intense heat right behind them.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.250
I've never seen anything like it.

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:17.250
When I left the house, the roar of the fire coming over the hill was unbelievable.

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.250
One of our close friends stepped out onto his balcony and noticed a glow on the hillside

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.250
and he gave my wife a call and said, did you know that there's a fire?

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:58.799
After the fire of dear Fran said, don't worry about anything.

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:07.799
We're going to give you all that you need and I broke down in tears just knowing what was about to happen.

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.800
Because we had to have us our shepherd and he will give us everything we need

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:17.800
and we have seen that those words come so true because our brothers and sisters have cared for us so beautifully

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.080
beyond anything we ever expected.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.080
I'm a builder myself and I just feel like I just want to get in there and do something.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:34.080
But the France needs spirituality and so if we help them with that, they'll get through the rest of it.

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:40.080
Well, the United States branch office is very concerned for our brothers and sisters spiritually

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.080
and making sure that they can get back to their worship to Jehovah God.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.080
So today we're here to encourage them to really to acknowledge what they've gone through

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.080
and make sure that they're getting their spiritual attention they need and the encouragement

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.080
that really the organization and their brothers want to give them.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:04.710
Just like a literal shepherd would want to care for the needs of their sheep, especially in injured one,

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:09.710
we want to do the same thing for the members of our congregation, but we take it a step further.

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:15.710
We want to care for them emotionally, spiritually and physically.

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:21.710
Jehovah has made us people that care for one another.

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:28.710
And generally speaking, the comfort he provides and the things we need are almost always delivered by people.

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:35.710
And it's the congregation that we can have that kind of comfort and support given to us that's going to help us recover.

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:58.340
Working in disaster relief efforts, you really begin to see just how much Jehovah cares for the human race, how much he cares for people.

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:08.340
You'll see people that will drop anything to come and rally to the aid of brothers and sisters of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:17.339
But they'll rally to the aid to someone next door too, and that's a manifestation of way Jehovah feels about people.

00:04:17.339 --> 00:04:27.800
Being prepared for a natural disaster, ourselves and our families, is not just a matter of personal safety.

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.800
This gets to the core of our spirituality.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:38.800
How much do we truly value life? How much do we truly value what Jehovah has given us?

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:47.560
In disaster, you hear people say, I've lost everything. Not among Jehovah's people. We never lose everything.

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:56.560
We may lose material possessions, we may even lose loved ones. But when we have Jehovah, we never lose everything.
