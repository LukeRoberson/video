WEBVTT

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:17.179
The governing body does a tremendous amount of work in preparing instruction based on

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:20.539
the powerful word of God.

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:26.500
But how does spiritual food and the form of audio and video programs reach all those

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.460
wanting to enjoy it?

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:35.659
In 2014, the Teaching Committee of the governing body approved the formation of the World

00:00:35.659 --> 00:00:39.659
Headquarters Broadcasting Department.

00:00:39.659 --> 00:00:46.659
This was to help transmit spiritual programs to people all around the world.

00:00:46.659 --> 00:00:51.060
First Corinthians chapter 14 verse 9 says in part,

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:56.340
Unless you with the tongue you speech that is easily understood, how will anyone know

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.500
what is being said?

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.340
At our Theocratic events, the audience needs to see the videos clearly and to hear the

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:07.180
talks and music easily.

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.859
How does the broadcasting department make this possible?

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:13.340
Our work in broadcasting is really too full.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:22.950
We focus on program transmission and the equipment needed to make that happen.

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.390
For convention program to really reach people's hearts, they have to be able to see it and

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.150
they have to be able to hear it.

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.829
So World Headquarters Broadcasting Department works with broadcasting departments at branches

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:36.109
around the world to try to make that happen.

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:40.069
The audio video equipment that we use is very expensive, so we're constantly looking

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:43.549
for ways that we can save dedicated funds.

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:48.950
When the organization began to show video content at conventions, we responded to help

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.590
branches in developing lands obtain the equipment they needed.

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.829
These countries had very limited resources.

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.150
It wasn't just that the equipment was expensive.

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:05.069
How do you get a video wall to a rural convention site in Africa?

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:07.510
Once it's there, how do you power it?

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:09.509
Who's going to operate it?

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:16.389
In some venues where we hold regional conventions, they don't have electricity.

00:02:16.389 --> 00:02:21.430
Additionally, getting the necessary equipment to all of the events can be challenging.

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.509
For example, the lack of roads and highways, transporting the equipment by sea on a small

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:31.830
boat, as well as having to use the same video equipment in several conventions and delivering

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.310
it on time.

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:41.710
It's the size of Western Europe, but only a handful of cities are connected by paved roads.

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:48.150
Many areas are accessible only during the dry season, using either land cruises, motorbikes,

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.389
dugout canoes, bicycles, or simply on foot.

00:02:52.389 --> 00:03:00.409
So transporting materials to certain areas can easily take several months.

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:04.930
To meet the need for the Engavere Regional Convention, the Broadcasting Department at World

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.729
Headquarters recommended that we purchase a portable LED display that could be transported

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:12.129
easily.

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:17.129
This meant manufacturing cases that were lighter, transporting the equipment by sea on a small

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:22.099
boat and using wheel barrels.

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:30.680
Also, the brothers had to carry the equipment, which included portable power generators and

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:36.879
gasoline for three hours on narrow, steep, slippery, and rocky paths.

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:44.360
In 2015, things started to change rapidly with the support of the World Headquarters

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:49.639
Broadcasting Department and the Regional Purchasing Office in Asia.

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:57.719
For the 2019 Regional Convention Series, 95% of the nearly 850,000 attendees had clear

00:03:57.719 --> 00:04:03.729
audio and video transmission for the entire programme.

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:09.930
I thank Jehovah so much that we can enjoy watching the videos, reports, experiences, and

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.169
music videos so clearly.

00:04:12.169 --> 00:04:17.009
Now, we have a better experience when we get to know our instructor more in ways that

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:22.620
touch our heart.

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:27.740
J.W. Stream is an online tool that was primarily designed as a way for us to broadcast everything

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.860
from large events that might go to millions of people, down to small events that would

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.540
be seen by just a few.

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.660
Really, it's our primary method of broadcast.

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:41.459
It can also be used to make online content available on demand as needed.

00:04:41.459 --> 00:04:46.860
An example of this on-demand content are recorded curingation meetings.

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.939
These recordings are made for the benefit of the multi-language field.

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:56.019
Globally, groups as well as curingations that might be small or isolated are able to

00:04:56.019 --> 00:05:01.579
benefit from these meetings.

00:05:01.579 --> 00:05:05.860
When I can hear meetings from Thailand, where the brothers use words and expressions that

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:10.060
touch my heart, it helps my faith get stronger.

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:14.779
It's like a tree that gets good fertilizer, which makes deep roots and results in the tree

00:05:14.779 --> 00:05:18.180
progressing better.

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:23.420
Thanks to the hard work of the World Headquarters Broadcasting Department, Bible instruction

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:29.500
is being transmitted at our theocratic events like never before.

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:35.740
These spiritual programmes not only touch our hearts, but also draws closer to our grand

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:38.139
instructor, Jehovah God.
