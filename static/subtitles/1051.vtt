00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:04.960
Can you see faith?

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.360
Turn with me, please, to Mark chapter 2.

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.160
And notice what the Bible says about this.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.660
In this account, Jesus is teaching in a crowded house in Copernium,

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.359
and Mark 2, 2 through 5, tells us,

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.960
and so many gathered that there was no more room, not even around the door,

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.960
and he began to speak the word to them.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.760
And they brought him a paralytic carried by four men,

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:35.359
but they could not bring him right to Jesus because of the crowd.

00:00:35.359 --> 00:00:40.359
So they removed the roof above Jesus.

00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:46.859
And after digging and opening, they lowered the stretcher on which the paralytic was lying.

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:53.159
When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic child,

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:55.359
your sins are forgiven.

00:00:55.359 --> 00:00:57.859
So yes, faith can be seen.

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:00.259
It's seen in the way we act.

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.060
Like other invisible things, faith is measured by its effects.

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:11.560
In fact, James 2.26 says that faith without works is dead.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.560
The question is, can others see my faith?

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:21.159
What effect is my faith producing in me?

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:25.859
A turn with me, please, to 1 Corinthians chapter 16.

00:01:25.959 --> 00:01:32.560
One effect that faith has on people is that it moves them to expand their activity in Kingdom service.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:38.560
And notice how the Apostle Paul expressed this at 1 Corinthians 16.9.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.959
Because a large door that leads to activity has been opened to me,

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:47.260
but there are many opposers.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:52.159
Paul took advantage of such opportunities to show his faith.

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:56.359
Has Jehovah opened a door to activity for you?

00:01:56.359 --> 00:02:06.459
In this symposium, we're going to discuss five ways in which a temporary opportunity leading to great activity and making disciples might present itself.

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:11.460
This could be in the form of learning a new language, moving where the need is greater,

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.759
applying to attend the school for Kingdom evangelizers,

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:17.759
assisting with a theocratic building project,

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:22.060
or donating generously to support the Kingdom work.

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.159
Now, why is faith needed to seize such opportunities?

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:30.360
And what blessings do we receive when we do?

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:36.560
First, why is faith needed to learn a new language in order to make disciples?

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.159
A turn with me, please, to Zechariah chapter 8.

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:42.659
A Zechariah chapter 8.

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:48.659
It takes faith to discern that current events are fulfilling Bible prophecy.

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:56.759
It takes faith to understand how we can act in harmony with God's purpose as revealed in that prophecy.

00:02:56.759 --> 00:03:01.259
A Zechariah 8.22 says,

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:13.560
and many peoples and mighty nations will come to seek Jehovah of armies in Jerusalem and to beg for the favor of Jehovah.

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:14.860
And verse 23 says,

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.659
This is what Jehovah of armies says.

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:25.060
In those days, ten men out of all the languages of the nations will take hold.

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.460
Yes, they will take firm hold of the robe of a Jew saying,

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:36.460
We want to go with you for we have heard that God is with you people.

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:43.159
Ten men, people who recognize that the only way to gain Jehovah's approval is to associate

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:51.259
with those who already have it, the Jew, also referred to here as you people, which people.

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:57.759
Obviously, not the people who refuse to pronounce God's name or those who remove it all together from their Bible translations.

00:03:57.759 --> 00:04:07.759
No, this refers to those who worship Jehovah by name, spirit-anointed Christians, the Israel of God,

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:10.060
referred to at Galatians 6.16.

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.860
And because ten can represent earthly completeness,

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:20.860
the ten men represent all men and women who have the hope of living forever on earth.

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:25.160
Now notice that they come not simply from all the nations,

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:31.160
but from all the languages of the nations in order to learn Jehovah's requirements.

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:38.259
Now, how will they hear the voice of the Jew in their language?

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:45.060
That might just be your door to activity.

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.459
Now, some might hesitate to learn a new language.

00:04:47.459 --> 00:04:50.860
Perhaps they hold back because of the time and energy that are required.

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.860
Others feel that they lack the ability.

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:57.160
And while it's true that before making any decision, we need to calculate the expense,

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.560
the question here is one of faith.

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.759
Can the God who gave ability to bezzalil,

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:06.259
who made the sun stand still for Joshua,

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:12.560
who gave power to Samson, also give you the ability, time, and energy to help those

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:17.160
who are begging for the favor of Jehovah?

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.959
Remember, Matthew 1720,

00:05:19.959 --> 00:05:27.259
if you have faith the size of a mustard grain, nothing will be impossible for you.

00:05:27.259 --> 00:05:29.660
And according to Philippians 2.13,

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:36.860
Holy Spirit can give us even the desire to preach to those who speak another language.

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:41.360
Is that Spirit drawing you now?

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.560
Remember, too, that through his organization,

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:47.160
Jehovah provides much help for those who are learning a new language.

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:51.959
JW.org contains reading material, audio recordings, and videos,

00:05:51.959 --> 00:05:55.759
in more languages than any other website.

00:05:55.759 --> 00:05:58.860
Then we have the JW Language app

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:02.560
and language classes arranged by the branch office.

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:07.560
When faith motivates us to make sacrifices to serve Jehovah,

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.360
he will help us to succeed,

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:13.759
and he will reward us with many blessings.

00:06:13.759 --> 00:06:15.259
For instance,

00:06:15.259 --> 00:06:18.259
a couple in their 60s kept finding Chinese people

00:06:18.259 --> 00:06:21.759
who accepted their invitations to attend congregation meetings.

00:06:21.759 --> 00:06:24.459
So they decided to learn Chinese,

00:06:24.459 --> 00:06:30.459
and within 10 years, they studied with 112 Chinese people.

00:06:30.459 --> 00:06:32.459
Okay, but with so many languages,

00:06:32.459 --> 00:06:36.360
how do I know which language to start learning?

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:39.160
Zechariah 822.

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:42.660
Who is begging for the favor of Jehovah?

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:45.660
You can learn about the needs in your area

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:49.360
by consulting with the elders and the circuit overseer.

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:50.959
In the following video,

00:06:50.959 --> 00:06:55.560
note how one couple responds to a need in the field.

00:06:55.560 --> 00:07:08.699
Oh, honestly, you shouldn't have.

00:07:08.699 --> 00:07:12.449
You're going to need it.

00:07:12.449 --> 00:07:16.550
Gabriel leave in to serve where the need is greater.

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:23.759
Made us feel like we missed the chance to expand our ministry.

00:07:23.759 --> 00:07:25.759
Why don't we start now?

00:07:25.759 --> 00:07:27.160
We're not getting any younger.

00:07:27.259 --> 00:07:30.160
Yeah, we could ask the circuit overseer

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:32.060
for our vice on his next visit.

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:36.060
But I'm worried he's going to say

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:39.560
we should join the new language group.

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:41.860
It's a big need in our socket.

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:44.660
We've never felt like the right people

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:46.660
to serve in a foreign language.

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:50.160
Brother Lindstrom shared Zechariah 823 with us,

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:53.560
which helped us to see how we could have a hand in help

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:56.459
in men out of all the languages of the nations

00:07:56.459 --> 00:08:07.379
to learn about Jehovah.

00:08:07.379 --> 00:08:17.350
Learning was a struggle at first.

00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:20.550
But with Jehovah's help, we made progress.

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:44.200
Slowly, even though the language was a challenge,

00:08:44.200 --> 00:09:04.500
loving our new family was not.

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:05.500
Shukar Sabai.

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:07.000
Shukar Sabai?

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.200
My wife, her name is Elliot.

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:11.299
Dalai Jani Romani.

00:09:11.299 --> 00:09:12.299
Oh, yeah, Janava.

00:09:12.299 --> 00:09:15.000
Sari Siklin, Marijub.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:15.899
It's Vinny.

00:09:15.899 --> 00:09:16.899
Moment.

00:09:16.899 --> 00:09:17.899
I don't.

00:09:17.899 --> 00:09:25.519
I don't understand.

00:09:25.519 --> 00:09:27.019
Morate Suni, I'll come up.

00:09:27.019 --> 00:09:28.419
Say again what you say.

00:09:28.419 --> 00:09:31.620
I'm Shukar Sabai.

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:33.720
My wife, her name is Elliot.

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:36.019
This is Verunava.

00:09:36.019 --> 00:09:39.820
Oh, Shastu, Situ, Venice.

00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:41.220
Come on, Dres.

00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:43.220
Come on, Dres.

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:43.820
OK.

00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:48.710
Oh, thank you.

00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:49.809
It's true.

00:09:49.809 --> 00:09:54.990
We aren't getting any younger.

00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:58.090
And that's why we're so glad we took the chance

00:09:58.090 --> 00:10:04.769
to expand our ministry.

00:10:04.769 --> 00:10:07.970
Did you notice how Elliot and Karin showed faith

00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:09.970
and how they were blessed?

00:10:09.970 --> 00:10:12.169
They talked to their circuit overseer

00:10:12.169 --> 00:10:14.970
who revealed a big need in a foreign language group

00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:16.370
in their circuit.

00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:19.769
He then showed them Zechariah 823.

00:10:19.769 --> 00:10:22.269
They read that scripture again later

00:10:22.269 --> 00:10:24.570
and they prayed about it together

00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:28.769
and then came the measurable effect of their faith.

00:10:28.769 --> 00:10:31.070
They put forth great efforts to learn.

00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:32.769
Then with humility and courage,

00:10:32.769 --> 00:10:35.669
they used their new language skills at the meetings

00:10:35.669 --> 00:10:37.169
and in the ministry.

00:10:37.169 --> 00:10:39.370
And they were able to help those

00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:42.669
who were begging for the favor of Jehovah.

00:10:42.669 --> 00:10:45.169
That's how it works.

00:10:45.169 --> 00:10:46.570
Simple?

00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:47.570
No.

00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:50.070
But if we invest the time and effort

00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:53.269
to learn a new language in order to do more for Jehovah,

00:10:53.269 --> 00:10:56.470
we can be confident that Jehovah will bless us

00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:58.870
with a rewarding ministry.

00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:01.169
As a couple from Britain said,

00:11:01.169 --> 00:11:03.870
the ministry in the foreign language field

00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:06.570
is one of the most exciting we've experienced

00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:10.570
during our 40 years of kingdom service.

00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:12.370
Why did they do it?

00:11:12.370 --> 00:11:15.470
Because people who are seeking Jehovah

00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:17.870
need to hear his requirements for life

00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:20.570
in words they can understand.

00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:22.970
A during a meeting held in Vietnamese,

00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:24.970
a man stood up and said

00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:27.269
with tears in his eyes,

00:11:27.269 --> 00:11:28.570
thank you.

00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:30.470
Thank you for the efforts you are making

00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:32.669
to learn my difficult language.

00:11:32.669 --> 00:11:35.970
I am so grateful to learn many wonderful things

00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:39.169
from the Bible in my old age.

00:11:39.169 --> 00:11:42.970
After attending a circuit assembly in his native Albanian,

00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:46.669
a man in his 70s living in New York City said,

00:11:46.669 --> 00:11:50.269
this is the best day of my life.

00:11:50.269 --> 00:11:52.070
He made arrangements that very day

00:11:52.070 --> 00:11:54.070
to start studying the Bible with a pioneer

00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:55.769
who had learned his language

00:11:55.769 --> 00:11:58.070
and within just a few years he began

00:11:58.070 --> 00:12:01.169
serving as a ministerial servant.

00:12:01.169 --> 00:12:05.570
These are blessings for exercising faith.

00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:10.769
Faith is measured by the way we act.

00:12:10.769 --> 00:12:15.370
Could you enter this door to activity in faith?

00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:17.669
Brother Samuel heard a member of the governing body

00:12:17.669 --> 00:12:20.970
will now consider the next talk of this symposium.

00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:23.669
Enter the door to activity in faith.

00:12:23.669 --> 00:12:26.669
Move to where the need is greater.
