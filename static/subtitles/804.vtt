00:00:01.679 --> 00:00:08.679
But now let me ask you this, do you know what OPI stands for?

00:00:08.679 --> 00:00:14.679
You'll find out and a lot more in the following report,

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:17.679
which will be given by Brother Paul Gilles,

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:25.750
who serves as the overseer of OPI.

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.750
Ecclesiastes 12 verse 10 says,

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:36.750
The congregator sought to find delightful words and to record accurate words of truth.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.750
In harmony with this principle, the Office of Public Information, OPI,

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.750
at World Headquarters, has over the years been assigned by the governing body

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.750
to convey accurate information to the news media and academics.

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.750
But as Satan intensifies his slanderous attacks on Jehovah's people

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:00.750
and opposes feed authorities with twisted and distorted statements about us,

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:08.750
OPI's assignment now includes conveying accurate words of truth to government officials.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.750
So in this report, we'd like to explain to you how and why this work is done

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.750
and also to relate a few experiences.

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.750
There are scriptural precedents for contacting government officials.

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:28.750
Jehovah positioned his servants before rulers in order to protect his people

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.750
or to further his purposes.

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:37.750
Examples include Joseph before Pharaoh, Nihamaya before King Artaxaxis,

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:43.750
Esther and Mordecai before King Azuharis and Paul before Felix.

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.750
Of course, we do not need the permission of governments to meet and to preach.

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:54.750
But we do recognize that having religious freedom and the cooperation of officials

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.750
is conducive to spreading the kingdom message.

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.750
While remaining politically neutral, we provide accurate information to kings

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:09.750
and all those in high positions so that we may go on leading a calm and quiet life

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.750
as First Timothy II versus two states.

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:19.750
Recently, brothers from OPI met with officials to address specific issues hindering our work in

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.750
Azerbaijan, Belarus, Russia and Central Asia.

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.750
In July, a meeting was held with the Prime Minister of one African country

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.750
to explain the reasons for our Christian neutrality.

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:40.750
Reports such as these that document incidents of injustice are provided to officials.

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.750
Many express appreciation for this information.

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:52.750
At a recent meeting held in Congo, Kinshasa, an embassy official commenting on the quality of these reports stated

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:59.750
they remain objective and moderate despite the seriousness of the facts.

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.750
So if we do not take the initiative to provide accurate information,

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:12.750
government officials may receive misinformation from composers trying to influence them to act against us.

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.750
Now while it takes time and effort to counteract lies and misinformation,

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:23.750
we have often experienced the truthfulness of what Proverbs 25 verse 15 tells us,

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:31.750
by patience, a commander is one over, and a gentle tongue can break a bone.

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:41.750
Well, let's now share with you some experiences that demonstrate the benefit of contacting both government officials and the media.

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:52.750
Regarding Russia, OPI keeps various officials around the world informed of the ongoing harassment and unjust detentions of our brothers.

00:03:52.750 --> 00:04:00.750
As a result, many of these authorities have issued strongly worded statements condemning the ban in Russia,

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.750
some of which you could find on the JW org newsroom.

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:14.750
Meanwhile, OPI communicated with journalists about Russia, one of whom wrote a very interesting article for the international edition of Newsweek.

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:28.750
This article appeared on the front cover, and this one outlet alone has published about 30 articles about the oppression of Jehovah's Witnesses, not just in Russia, but other countries.

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:41.220
Each year in Uzbekistan, our brothers experience police raids, detentions, fines, and sadly, in some occasions, severe beatings.

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:45.220
This is just for carrying out their Christian ministry.

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:52.220
Now often the reason for that is because we have been consistently denied registration.

00:04:52.220 --> 00:05:01.220
This photograph shows some brothers and sisters who are maintaining their joy, despite all of them having been fined exorbitant amounts.

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:12.220
Now interestingly, on May 14, 2018, the ambassador from Uzbekistan to the United States said this in Washington, D.C.

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:18.220
Jehovah's Witnesses will be able to register much easier.

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:31.220
So, seizing this opportunity, a delegation of brothers was approved to travel to Uzbekistan last month and held preliminary discussions with government representatives.

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:43.730
If it be Jehovah's will, we certainly pray that these efforts will lead to national registration and some relief for our brothers who have endured persecution.

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:52.730
Where appropriate, OPI also helps branches to organize public events in areas where our work is often misrepresented.

00:05:52.730 --> 00:06:04.730
For instance, in Kazakhstan, where there have been some obstacles, local officials and communities have recently demonstrated a willingness to learn more about Jehovah's people.

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:12.730
Therefore, the branch hosted a series of open house events in Kingdom Halls in select locations.

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:18.730
A number of officials, media representatives and other professionals attended these events.

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:35.730
A government ministry wrote to the brothers stating, these events will provide the citizens of our country an opportunity to learn more about the activities and the history of Jehovah's Witnesses in Kazakhstan and worldwide.

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:53.579
In Sri Lanka, the Cardinal of the Catholic Church wrote to the President and other representatives of the government demanding that they cancel the special convention that was scheduled for just last July.

00:06:53.579 --> 00:07:04.579
Not only did the Cardinal not get his way, but favorable government ministers actually invited the branch to hold a press conference to publicize the convention.

00:07:04.579 --> 00:07:14.579
After OPI prepared the Sri Lanka branch for the event, approximately 45 media representatives attended the press conference held at Bethel.

00:07:14.579 --> 00:07:23.579
Some of the journalists who attended this press conference also attended the special convention and published positive news stories.

00:07:23.579 --> 00:07:34.579
So, instead of the clergy successfully influencing government officials to cancel the convention, these officials actually assisted us in publicizing it.

00:07:34.579 --> 00:07:47.269
One of the tools that we use for conveying accurate information to the media and government officials is the newsroom section of JW.org.

00:07:48.269 --> 00:08:04.269
However, seeing the need for our brotherhood to have a source of reliable reports about current events involving Jehovah's people, the majority of articles are now written with you in mind.

00:08:04.269 --> 00:08:18.269
Quite a few have expressed appreciation for the imprisoned for their faith feature, which is now updated monthly and allows us to mention imprisoned brothers by name in our prayers.

00:08:18.269 --> 00:08:30.269
Just as an example, these are the faces of some of our young brothers in Turkmenistan who have been imprisoned as conscientious objectors during 2018.

00:08:30.269 --> 00:08:38.679
Jesus foretold, you will be hated by all the nations on account of my name.

00:08:38.679 --> 00:08:46.679
So, we recognize that no amount of effort to educate government officials is going to change that.

00:08:46.679 --> 00:08:52.679
Like Pharaoh, some of the world's dictators harden their hearts against Jehovah.

00:08:53.679 --> 00:09:05.679
However, Jesus also foretold, you will be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a witness to them and the nations.

00:09:05.679 --> 00:09:15.679
It's not just OPI that is giving a witness to the governments. It is every brotherhood sister that officials come in contact with.

00:09:15.679 --> 00:09:24.679
We have often heard a government official say that they know either a schoolmate, a former workmate, or a relative who is one of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:09:24.679 --> 00:09:30.679
Additionally, each and every brother in prison is giving a witness.

00:09:30.679 --> 00:09:44.679
For example, on July 15, 2018, during a press interview, the Prime Minister of Armenia commented on his contact with Jehovah's Witnesses when he was a political prisoner.

00:09:44.679 --> 00:09:52.679
He said, there were prisoners Jehovah's Witnesses who were there for not serving in the army.

00:09:52.679 --> 00:09:57.679
These people were convinced about their beliefs.

00:09:57.679 --> 00:10:04.679
And then he added, you don't have to agree with them, but you could feel it was their conviction.

00:10:05.679 --> 00:10:24.679
So who knows if someone who observes your conduct or who you talk to in field service or on public transport, may be the very person who one day is in a government position and knows something about Jehovah's Witnesses because of what you did or said.

00:10:24.679 --> 00:10:32.679
Indeed, we couldn't do the work in OPI without you brothers and sisters setting such a fine example.

00:10:32.679 --> 00:10:53.679
Those who work in the Office of Public Information, under the direction of the Coordinators Committee, considered a real privilege to support all of you by communicating with government officials, representatives of the media and academia by conveying our beliefs and practices with accurate words of truth.

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:20.440
Thank you kindly, Brother Gilles, for that thought-provoking update on the important work being done in the Office of Public Information.

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:24.440
You notice how quickly I learned the meaning of that acronym.

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:29.440
If you remember from a previous annual meeting, Brother Heard especially likes acronyms.

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:41.909
Brother Gilles, we know Britain misses having you, but we're very happy to have you with us here in headquarters, at headquarters.

00:11:41.909 --> 00:11:56.539
But you will have to learn how to correctly say, schedule, but we love you anyway.

00:11:56.539 --> 00:11:59.539
But now let me ask you this.

00:11:59.539 --> 00:12:10.539
Does it seem like our brothers and sisters around the globe are being pummeled with more and more natural disasters?

00:12:10.539 --> 00:12:19.539
Well, you'll find out, Brother John Ekron, who serves as a helper to the Coordinators Committee, will give us the facts.

00:12:19.539 --> 00:12:25.100
You'll find it very interesting, Brother Ekron, please.

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:30.100
In 2017 and 2018, we're certainly record years for disasters.

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:36.100
Just look at a few of the headlines from the news in 2017 and 2018.

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:43.100
There were earthquakes in Mexico, plague in Madagascar, food shortages in Venezuela.

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:45.100
Disasters are going to get worse.

00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:56.100
In Congo, deadly Nipah virus in India, volcano erupts in Guatemala, violence in Cameroon and Ebola in the DRC.

00:12:56.100 --> 00:13:06.100
Now, we are not surprised because we see the increased frequency and intensity of disasters as fulfillment of Bible prophecy.

00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:16.570
If we look at Luke, chapter 21, and look at verses 10 and 11, Jesus said,

00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:24.570
then He said to them, nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be great earthquakes.

00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:36.570
And in one place after another, food shortages and pestilences, we are actually witnessing and can see the fulfillment of Jesus' words.

00:13:36.570 --> 00:13:49.570
We are seeing earthquakes in one place after another, and truly great earthquakes as Jesus described.

00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:54.570
Volcanoes dump huge amounts of ash and smoke into the air.

00:13:54.570 --> 00:14:01.570
Tornados, hurricanes, and typhoon winds destroy buildings and property.

00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:16.570
Rain and flooding from these huge storms cause rivers to overflow and damage large areas of lands and property, causing mud and debris to flow into buildings like this expandable kingdom hall.

00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:30.549
Wildfires engulf both forests and communities and flames and smoke, really leaving only behind the charred remains of what was once called home.

00:14:30.549 --> 00:14:37.549
Now, when there is a disaster, all of us are keenly interested to know how our brothers and sisters doing.

00:14:37.549 --> 00:14:47.549
The JW News section of JW.org is regularly updated with news of how our brothers and sisters are affected by a certain disaster.

00:14:47.549 --> 00:15:00.370
Just here, we see some of the headlines that are on JW News lately, and we encourage you to read this section regularly to stay up to date.

00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:06.370
Now, to show you the size and scale of disasters lately, look at this map.

00:15:06.370 --> 00:15:12.370
As we plot on it, the disasters that have occurred in just the last service year.

00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:17.970
And do you notice the number of brothers that are affected?

00:15:17.970 --> 00:15:26.970
Did you notice close to half a million of our brothers were directly affected by these disasters in just the last couple of years?

00:15:26.970 --> 00:15:36.970
Now, it's sad to say that 22 of our brothers and sisters died in these disasters, and 84 were seriously injured.

00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:46.970
Tens of thousands of our brothers have had to find new homes, and of these 14,000 had to completely flee their homeland.

00:15:47.970 --> 00:15:57.970
Now, we want all of you to know that have been affected by many of these disasters just in the last couple of years that we love and pray for you.

00:15:57.970 --> 00:16:01.970
You are not lost or forgotten.

00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:07.970
Jehovah says in Isaiah 49.15, I would never forget you.

00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:13.970
Now, proof that Jehovah has not forgotten you is the love of your brotherhood.

00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:19.970
Now, Acts chapter 2 describes in the first century how the brothers then took care of one another.

00:16:19.970 --> 00:16:27.970
Acts chapter 2 describes how our brothers were willing to sell properties and possessions to help one another out.

00:16:27.970 --> 00:16:34.970
In Acts chapter 11, the brothers sent relief aid to those who were facing a very great famine.

00:16:34.970 --> 00:16:39.970
Well, how has our united brotherhood responded to these disasters today?

00:16:39.970 --> 00:16:49.970
Well, there's a fine phrase in Philippians chapter 1 and verse 27 that can show really how our brothers and sisters, all of us, are helping one another.

00:16:49.970 --> 00:17:00.970
Philippians chapter 1 and verse 27, it is only behave in a manner worthy of the good news about the Christ so that whether I come and see you, or I am absent,

00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:13.970
I may hear about you and learn that you are standing firm in one spirit with one soul and here's the phrase, striving side by side for the faith of the good news.

00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:22.970
Well, one very big way that we can strive side by side and helping one another is by our donations to the worldwide work.

00:17:22.970 --> 00:17:29.970
This chart gives you an idea of the cost of disasters and how they jumped in 2018.

00:17:29.970 --> 00:17:40.970
As you can see, we spent it on an average of between five and seven million dollars on disaster relief and past service years, but look though what has happened in 2018.

00:17:40.970 --> 00:17:47.970
Just in 2018, it has climbed to over $33 million.

00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:56.970
Now, what will happen in 2019? What will we see? Well, it's already off to a big start in September.

00:17:56.970 --> 00:18:05.970
The governing body asks that I pass along to all of you, thanks and appreciation for your generous donations.

00:18:05.970 --> 00:18:13.970
We would like to assure you that your donations are being put to good use in helping in one disaster after another.

00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:24.950
Now, another way that we as a brotherhood work side by side is volunteering to assist in a disaster.

00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:34.950
Thousands of our brothers and sisters have willingly volunteered to reconstruct or repair kingdoms or our brothers and sisters homes.

00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:45.950
Others carry and deliver food, water, and many other items needed after disaster to help our brothers by using any transportation means possible.

00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:51.950
Horses, boats, trucks, some volunteer with paint rollers and brushes.

00:18:51.950 --> 00:18:58.950
Others show up with shovels to clean up after a disaster, prepare meals for the workers,

00:18:58.950 --> 00:19:05.950
put supply packages together, and sort, bag, and deliver them.

00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:08.950
All with a smile, just look at all these happy faces.

00:19:08.950 --> 00:19:17.900
We want to thank all of you that have worked so hard on disaster relief, especially the last couple of years.

00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:28.900
We also want to thank the departments at headquarters, the branch committees, the branch departments, the circuit overseers, LDCs, disaster relief committees,

00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:36.900
and all of you elders worldwide that have really pitched in and helped so much with disaster relief efforts the past couple of years.

00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:38.900
Thank you.

00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:44.900
Well, how do our brothers and sisters feel about your love and support?

00:19:44.900 --> 00:20:02.220
Well, as you watch this next video, I'm going to read to you a sentence or two from different letters of appreciation that our brothers have sent in following a disaster.

00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:09.220
Jehovah knows when we're in need, and he spoils us by giving us even more than we ask for.

00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:23.220
Your deep concern, as well as the spiritual, emotional, and material support you've provided, and that we're still receiving, is a real soothing ointment that can help us to endure.

00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:32.220
When we see our belongings covered with mud, brought outside, and thrown as garbage, we feel very heartbroken.

00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:41.220
But the brothers and sisters saw them not as a lump of garbage, but as a mass of our feelings.

00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:45.220
The day the construction brothers arrived at my home, I burst into tears.

00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:54.220
Now, I'd like to clarify that I didn't cry because I was going to get a new house, but because I saw Jehovah's hand in my life.

00:20:54.220 --> 00:21:05.220
The transformation was not limited to my house. This experience has changed me. I've not only seen but also felt Jehovah's tender care.

00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:15.220
They not only repaired our house, they also repaired our heart. We were able to see Jehovah in this beautiful work of strengthening help.

00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:25.220
Even though we lost our possessions, being busy in the construction and preaching work helped us to maintain our emotional and spiritual balance.

00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:46.549
We felt a lump in our throats at being witnesses to the tender care of our protective God.

00:21:46.549 --> 00:21:53.549
We can expect that disasters are going to intensify as we get closer to the end of this system.

00:21:53.549 --> 00:22:00.549
The study note on Mark chapter 13 and verse 8 on the phrase, pangs of distress says this.

00:22:00.549 --> 00:22:13.549
It may suggest that like birth pains, the foretold troubles and suffering will increase in frequency, intensity, and duration in the time period before a great tribulation.

00:22:13.549 --> 00:22:22.960
Who knows? You may be next to need help from your brothers. Be prepared.

00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:31.960
But at the same time, don't put trust in money or your belongings. All can be gone instantly.

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:38.960
Well, nothing of our possessions will last forever. The love of Jehovah and the love of our brothers will.

00:22:38.960 --> 00:23:05.490
As we face increasing disasters, let's continue side by side to help everyone, each one of us to survive this old system.

00:23:05.490 --> 00:23:13.930
We appreciate very much brother Ekran that enlightening report that you gave us.

00:23:13.930 --> 00:23:18.930
Now those were some necessary announcements you needed to know about.

00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:28.579
But we have two more very exciting announcements. We thought it'd be better if you were seated for these.

00:23:28.579 --> 00:23:30.579
Here's the first one.

00:23:30.579 --> 00:23:47.579
The governing body has approved a significant redesign of the JW.org website to include the features of JW Broadcasting and Watchtower Online Library.

00:23:47.579 --> 00:23:59.579
Additionally, the JW Library app will be redesigned and will incorporate the content and features of Watchtower Library.

00:23:59.579 --> 00:24:10.579
As a result, the overall appearance of the new website and app will be unified and become more user friendly.

00:24:10.579 --> 00:24:21.579
Planning and design work have already begun on this very large project. You should see certain improvements within a few months.

00:24:21.579 --> 00:24:26.579
Now this time less than six months does apply. But what do you think of that?

00:24:26.579 --> 00:24:50.339
Now here's one more very exciting announcement, especially for our field missionaries, some of whom may be here in attendance. You'll be happy you were seated.

00:24:50.339 --> 00:25:04.339
For nearly 75 years, Gilead train missionaries have been serving in the worldwide field, opening up new territories as well as strengthening the brotherhood.

00:25:04.339 --> 00:25:12.339
The majority of these missionaries continue to serve in field assignments and have gained valuable experience.

00:25:12.339 --> 00:25:24.339
We are pleased to inform you that the governing body has given approval for all field missionaries with an FMF enrollment

00:25:24.339 --> 00:25:34.339
who have been serving for at least five years to attend the School of Kingdom Evangelizers SKE.

00:25:34.339 --> 00:25:48.339
This provision will reinforce the spirituality of these dear ones. They will be mixed into the SKE classes along with new students to allow others to benefit from their experience.

00:25:48.339 --> 00:26:13.250
Approved missionaries will attend SKE in the location of the school of the country to which they are assigned.

00:26:13.250 --> 00:26:20.250
We're all very happy for you hard working field missionaries.

00:26:20.250 --> 00:26:32.250
But now brotherhood has a couple more acronyms as result of this announcement. The FMF enrollment and SKE classes.

00:26:32.250 --> 00:26:51.849
So brotherhood, I hope you took note of that. But now for the next one hour and twenty minutes, we're going to get to enjoy some very exciting fast moving in lightning talks given by five different members of the governing body.

00:26:51.849 --> 00:27:04.849
You notice I highlighted that word enlightening. Our lead off speaker is brother Kenneth Cook who will present the talk we should be teachers, brother cook.

00:27:04.849 --> 00:27:21.509
After a convention, we often say that the teaching was better than ever. But even the best teachers at this convention or your convention or on today's program are no match for the great teacher.

00:27:21.509 --> 00:27:31.509
Jesus was an exceptional teacher. Imagine what it would have been like to hear Jesus teach. What made him so effective?

00:27:31.509 --> 00:27:44.509
We don't have to guess. Consider a few of the methods that he used in the Sermon on the Mount. For example, his introduction aroused interest and introduced his subject.

00:27:44.509 --> 00:27:55.509
At Matthew chapter five, for example, in verse three, Jesus simply said, happy are those conscious of their spiritual need.

00:27:55.509 --> 00:28:04.509
That simple statement provided the interest for his listeners. They would want to know, how would this make me happy?

00:28:04.509 --> 00:28:16.509
He then added, since the kingdom of the heavens belongs to them, and there is the subject that he consistently used to mark his teaching.

00:28:16.509 --> 00:28:33.509
Jesus also used effective questions to reason with his listeners. He crafted simple but powerful illustrations. And if birds and lollies were on hand, perhaps he was actually using visual aids during that Sermon on the Mount.

00:28:33.509 --> 00:28:42.509
Finally, his conclusion was simple. It was brief and motivating. No wonder Jesus listeners were astounded.

00:28:42.509 --> 00:28:53.509
Did Jesus expect us to be merely astounded at his teaching, though? No. He commissioned his disciples to go preaching and teaching.

00:28:53.509 --> 00:29:03.509
Paul later plainly told the Hebrew Christians, you should be teachers. Why was effective teaching so necessary then and now?

00:29:03.509 --> 00:29:18.509
Because lives are involved. Parents, Satan is waging war for the hearts of your children. So it's never been more important to inculcate the truth in them. It means their life, elders.

00:29:18.509 --> 00:29:29.509
Our fellow worshipers are battered by this system. So it's never been more important to encourage and strengthen them to endure. It means their life.

00:29:29.509 --> 00:29:46.509
And publishers, that's all of us here. The end is rapidly drawing near. So it's never been more important to teach Bible truth in a simple, appealing and motivating way. It means life to those who listen to us.

00:29:47.509 --> 00:30:06.509
Because teaching is so important, Jehovah has motivated skilled teachers to pass on their methods to others. For this reason, the Bible tells us that Paul imparted to Timothy not only what to teach, but also his methods or how to teach.

00:30:07.509 --> 00:30:17.509
Those methods, it says, were valid everywhere in every congregation. So Timothy passed those methods on to others.

00:30:17.509 --> 00:30:28.509
Today, Jehovah's organization has endeavored to follow the same pattern. Teaching teachers has a long history in Jehovah's organization.

00:30:28.509 --> 00:30:43.509
Let's look at some modern examples of how Jehovah has trained us to be teachers. In 1922, the school of the prophets was used by some groups of Bible students to develop the art of public teaching and speaking.

00:30:44.509 --> 00:30:59.950
One suggestion in the booklet was to practice a figure eight gesture, yes, so that speakers would learn to move their arms and hands in curves. Those schools were later discontinued.

00:31:02.839 --> 00:31:17.839
In 1942, even before the Theocratic ministry school was introduced to the congregations, a series of articles in Consolation magazine appeared until 1945, under the heading, presenting this gospel of the kingdom.

00:31:17.839 --> 00:31:36.839
The first article stated that the series purpose, it said, quote, to give help for instruction and practical hints to such ones as would publish God's kingdom after the example of Christ himself, study and apply this instruction and note your improvement as a kingdom publisher.

00:31:37.839 --> 00:31:51.839
In 1943, the booklet course in Theocratic ministry featured 52 lessons, one for each week of the year and conjunction with a newly formed Theocratic ministry school.

00:31:51.839 --> 00:32:18.839
In 1945, the book Theocratic aid to kingdom publishers expanded that course to 90 lessons. 1955, the book qualified to be ministers was described in the watchtower as the best yet book for the Theocratic ministry school until it was revised into an even better qualified book in 1967.

00:32:18.839 --> 00:32:38.839
1971, the Theocratic ministry school guidebook was released and then in 2002, we received benefit from theocratic ministry school education, which included new study points, exercises and a council form right in the book.

00:32:38.839 --> 00:33:07.839
Clearly, as needs change, Jehovah provides us with new tools to improve our teaching. Is it time for a new tool to improve our skills as teachers? Consider the following regarding our ministry school textbook, one terminology, the contents and even the title of that book referred to the Theocratic ministry school and that as such is no longer in place.

00:33:08.839 --> 00:33:32.839
Number two, simplicity. Many find it difficult to find quickly key ideas in the book's 53 study points. An elder from Georgia, USA, wrote, in the short time available to direct the congregation to specific locations in the book, it makes it very difficult for the brothers to find where the chairman is.

00:33:32.839 --> 00:33:46.839
Number three, translation. It isn't easy to translate a book this big. In fact, in over 200 languages around the globe, congregations have the meeting workbook, but lack the ministry school book.

00:33:46.839 --> 00:33:57.839
For all of these reasons and more, we are pleased to announce a release that addresses those concerns and that will help more of God's people to improve their teaching.

00:33:58.839 --> 00:34:27.500
It is a 28 page brochure entitled Apply Yourself to Reading and Teaching. The chairman will let you know how you can access a copy for your personal use, no doubt in less than six months.

00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:38.260
In addition, the instructions for a Christian life and ministry meeting will soon be revised and made available to the public.

00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:56.260
Now, this brochure will be used at our midweek meetings worldwide beginning January 7, 2019. Don't discard your ministry school book, though, although we won't be using it at our weekly meetings, it is still a very valuable reference.

00:34:56.260 --> 00:35:15.170
Would you like to know more about some of this new brochure's features? We begin with brevity. There are only 20 study points and each study point is only one page long.

00:35:15.170 --> 00:35:30.170
Does this mean important points have been omitted? No. In many cases, similar points have been combined. For example, study five, accurate reading incorporates key ideas from three points in the ministry school book.

00:35:30.170 --> 00:35:42.170
They are accurate reading, words clearly spoken and correct pronunciation. After all, reading accurately includes pronouncing each word correctly and clearly.

00:35:42.170 --> 00:35:56.170
Oh, and by the way, the brochure does not suggest using that figure eight gesture. So you don't have to worry about that. Another feature is clarity. Each study features two or three main points with simple direct instructions.

00:35:56.170 --> 00:36:10.170
And some study points also include practical tips that relate to the main point. In addition, you will find that many of the study points include a box entitled in the ministry. Why?

00:36:10.170 --> 00:36:23.170
Because while most of the points in the brochure apply both to the field ministry and to teaching from the platform suggestions that are specific to the field ministry appear in this separate box.

00:36:23.170 --> 00:36:38.170
Next is a feature that you will really find of interest. Record your progress. One of the last pages of the brochure is for you to record the date you consider each study point. More about that in a moment.

00:36:38.170 --> 00:36:49.170
So there are some features, but how will the new brochure address the three needs that we mentioned earlier, namely terminology, simplicity and translation.

00:36:49.170 --> 00:37:04.170
We begin with terminology. The brochure uses updated expressions, but it also does not refer to specific meetings or meeting parts. Therefore, it will not need to be frequently revised.

00:37:04.170 --> 00:37:20.170
Next, simplicity. Fewer study points and a simple easy to use layout will allow the chairman to isolate main points quickly and will help the audience to follow along closely with the chairman.

00:37:20.170 --> 00:37:30.170
Also, and you elders are going to love this. More is being done to simplify the work of the chairman and the life and ministry meeting overseer.

00:37:30.170 --> 00:37:44.170
Beginning January 7, 2019, the instructions in the meeting workbook for each student assignment will include in parentheses the specific study point that the student should work on.

00:37:44.170 --> 00:37:55.170
As an example, for the week of January 7, all brothers worldwide who are assigned the Bible reading will consider study point five accurate reading.

00:37:55.170 --> 00:38:17.179
We thought you would like that. Life and ministry meeting overseers and chairman will no longer need to worry about assigning study points or keeping track of what each student is working on.

00:38:17.179 --> 00:38:32.579
Would you like to see a chairman use the new brochure to assist a student? Please watch.

00:38:32.579 --> 00:38:37.579
Administration of the province of Babylon, but Daniel served in the King's Court.

00:38:37.579 --> 00:38:45.900
Thank you, Brother Gomez. That was an excellent reading. You were accurate, fluent, and we could tell that you prepared well.

00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:56.900
You're working on study point number 10, modulation. The summary tells us that we have two goals in modulating our voice. One goal is to stir emotion.

00:38:56.900 --> 00:39:03.900
You stirred our emotions when you read Daniel 247. Truly, your God is a God of God's.

00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:10.900
By raising your pitch, you convey Nebuchadnezzar's intensity and surprise. That's the way to do it.

00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:16.900
A second goal is to convey ideas clearly. One way to do it is to increase our volume.

00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:24.900
For example, what is the main point of verse 44? Isn't it that Jehovah will set up a kingdom?

00:39:24.900 --> 00:39:31.900
So instead of emphasizing the word kings, you might increase your volume when reading God of heaven.

00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:37.900
In the days of those kings, the God of heaven will set up a kingdom.

00:39:37.900 --> 00:39:40.900
So that's something you might try when preparing to read a scripture.

00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:47.900
Look for the main point in each verse, and then try varying your pitch, pace, or volume to make that idea stand out.

00:39:47.900 --> 00:39:50.900
Thank you, Brother Gomez. Well done.

00:39:50.900 --> 00:40:01.219
For our next part, we'll consider...

00:40:01.219 --> 00:40:09.219
That was a very good example of concise and helpful one-minute comments and counsel by the chairman.

00:40:09.219 --> 00:40:13.219
But where does the chairman write whether the student completed the assigned point?

00:40:13.219 --> 00:40:16.219
He doesn't write anything.

00:40:16.219 --> 00:40:23.219
But on the page, record your progress mentioned earlier, who will write the dates that the student considered each point?

00:40:23.219 --> 00:40:26.219
The student, not the chairman.

00:40:26.219 --> 00:40:31.219
When should a student record a date on this page? Well, that's up to you, the student.

00:40:31.219 --> 00:40:37.219
Many will likely record the date that they are assigned to consider a specific point for a student assignment.

00:40:37.219 --> 00:40:46.219
Others, including elders, who may not handle student assignments regularly, may want to consider each of these points on their own.

00:40:46.219 --> 00:40:51.219
Each brother and sister can decide when and how to use this page to record their progress.

00:40:51.219 --> 00:40:56.219
This, record your progress page is for your personal use.

00:40:56.219 --> 00:41:01.219
Now, so far, we've looked at the need for updated terminology and greater simplicity.

00:41:01.219 --> 00:41:04.219
Now, let's consider that third point, translation.

00:41:04.219 --> 00:41:12.219
You will be thrilled to know that the governing body has already approved for this brochure to be translated into over 350 languages,

00:41:12.219 --> 00:41:17.219
more than twice the number of languages that produce the current textbook.

00:41:17.219 --> 00:41:30.219
But the same brevity that allows us to expand the translation also means that there are a few real life examples in the brochure that show how to apply the study points.

00:41:30.219 --> 00:41:39.219
So, one to be helpful to see how to put the study points into action, both from the platform and in the field ministry, and Dita Wood.

00:41:39.219 --> 00:41:48.219
For this reason, the governing body has approved the production of 20 videos, one for each study point to depict the application of these points.

00:41:48.219 --> 00:42:03.489
Let's watch the video for study one effective introductions.

00:42:03.489 --> 00:42:07.489
You're at the Kingdom Hall about to give a public talk.

00:42:07.489 --> 00:42:11.489
Will the audience listen to what you have to say?

00:42:11.489 --> 00:42:15.489
Much depends on how you introduce your subject.

00:42:15.489 --> 00:42:25.489
An effective introduction arouses interest, identifies your subject, and shows why the subject is important to your listeners.

00:42:25.489 --> 00:42:30.489
Let's give our brother an opportunity to introduce his subject.

00:42:30.489 --> 00:42:39.929
As the meeting chairman mentioned, we're going to talk about death and what it means to you and me.

00:42:39.929 --> 00:42:44.929
Let's read a scripture at Ecclesiastes95.

00:42:44.929 --> 00:43:00.929
So, what do you think? Did the speaker identify his subject? Yes. Did he arouse interest? Not so much. Did he show why the subject is important?

00:43:00.929 --> 00:43:07.929
No. So, how might he approach the subject differently? Let's watch.

00:43:07.929 --> 00:43:14.929
Throughout all of human history, not one person has escaped death.

00:43:14.929 --> 00:43:23.929
The lives of some people are cut short suddenly by unexpected events or illness. Have you ever lost a loved one in death?

00:43:23.929 --> 00:43:34.929
If so, you know how painful that is. Yet, how can something that causes so much pain be a normal, natural part of life?

00:43:34.929 --> 00:43:45.929
The Bible is the key to understanding why we die. Where we go when we die and how death will be reversed.

00:43:45.929 --> 00:43:49.929
Let's consider each of those points.

00:43:49.929 --> 00:43:58.929
You can apply this principle to any subject when giving a talk. But how can you effectively introduce a subject in the ministry?

00:43:58.929 --> 00:44:05.929
Remember, of course, that in most cases you're a complete stranger to the householder. Try not to startle the person.

00:44:05.929 --> 00:44:14.929
Identify yourself early in the conversation. To determine what a person might be interested in, observe his activities or surroundings.

00:44:15.929 --> 00:44:27.739
You might begin by asking a question or making a brief comment about those things. Let's consider one example.

00:44:27.739 --> 00:44:36.739
Hi, my name's Jill. I'm here to talk about God's purpose for the future. The Bible says here, sorry, but I don't have time to talk.

00:44:36.739 --> 00:44:42.679
Was the introduction effective?

00:44:42.679 --> 00:44:49.679
The householder didn't want to continue the conversation, so apparently the introduction didn't arouse interest.

00:44:49.679 --> 00:44:53.679
How might the publisher have handled the situation better?

00:44:53.679 --> 00:45:04.940
Good morning. You have a beautiful garden. It must take a lot of work.

00:45:04.940 --> 00:45:06.940
It sure does.

00:45:06.940 --> 00:45:09.940
Well, your work is certainly paying off. Thank you.

00:45:09.940 --> 00:45:14.940
By the way, my name's Jill, and this is Tammy. I'm Emily.

00:45:14.940 --> 00:45:18.940
Emily, you work so hard to care for the garden you planted.

00:45:19.940 --> 00:45:27.760
Do you think that God cares the same way about this planet that he created?

00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:37.760
Because the publisher took into account the interests of the householder, she increased the chances of starting a conversation and sharing the kingdom message.

00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:42.760
This can also be done in urban areas where people expect you to get right to the point.

00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:49.760
In such settings, try to include a thought-provoking statement or question in your introduction.

00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:59.760
Effective introductions are the first step toward productive conversations and presentations of the good news.

00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:24.139
Jesus foretold that the preaching of the good news of the kingdom will stop when the end comes, so our work is urgent.

00:46:24.139 --> 00:46:27.139
However, the work of teaching has only just begun.

00:46:27.139 --> 00:46:34.139
Isaiah 26 and verse 9 says of Jehovah that when there are judgments from you for the earth,

00:46:34.139 --> 00:46:41.139
the inhabitants of the land learn about righteousness, and that will certainly prove to be true in the new world.

00:46:41.139 --> 00:46:46.139
The great crowd will soon be invited to teach vast numbers of resurrected ones.

00:46:46.139 --> 00:46:51.139
You may study with someone who lived 3,000 years ago or more.

00:46:51.139 --> 00:47:00.139
Imagine how helpful it will be to have learned how to explain unfamiliar terms in study 17, understandable to others.

00:47:00.139 --> 00:47:07.139
Your student may have lived during the Middle Ages when people were taught to fear the clergy rather than to love God.

00:47:07.139 --> 00:47:12.139
But you will have already learned from study 19 how to reach the heart of your student.

00:47:12.139 --> 00:47:19.139
And when you're asked to summarize all that Jehovah did for his people during the last days, you'll need to keep things simple.

00:47:19.139 --> 00:47:24.139
Something you learned in study 14, main points made to stand out.

00:47:24.139 --> 00:47:28.139
Even today, however, we must be teachers.

00:47:28.139 --> 00:47:33.139
So use this new brochure to continue applying yourself to reading and teaching.

00:47:33.139 --> 00:47:40.139
By doing this, the Bible tells us, you will save both yourself and those who listen to you.

00:47:40.139 --> 00:48:00.679
Thank you so much, Brother Cook, and thank you also for joining us on the governing body.

00:48:00.679 --> 00:48:06.679
To borrow words from Brother Sidlik, the Lord knew we needed your help.

00:48:06.679 --> 00:48:11.500
I'm still working on that too.

00:48:11.500 --> 00:48:20.500
But we have the following announcement regarding our wonderful new brochure and a double check that got the right announcement this time.

00:48:20.500 --> 00:48:38.500
The teaching brochure in all available languages will be released on JW.org, Watchtower Online Library and JW Library on Monday, October the 8th, 2018.

00:48:38.500 --> 00:48:45.500
Now, in addition to that, if you will be making use of a hard copy of this publication,

00:48:45.500 --> 00:48:54.500
one copy of the printed edition will be available after the program at the various annual meeting locations,

00:48:54.500 --> 00:49:01.500
including the main lobby of your complex for those watching from their personal rooms.

00:49:01.500 --> 00:49:06.500
Additional printed copies may be requested through the congregations.

00:49:06.500 --> 00:49:11.500
So Monday, two days, you get this one electronically.

00:49:11.500 --> 00:49:18.500
But now, moving to our next talk, we're privileged to listen to Brother Anthony Morris,

00:49:18.500 --> 00:49:26.500
and he's going to deliver the gripping talk. This is it.

00:49:26.500 --> 00:49:31.500
I hope I rendered justice to announcing that title for Brother Morris.

00:49:31.500 --> 00:49:35.500
I'll talk to you later, huh?

00:49:35.500 --> 00:49:50.409
I ruined my introduction. That's all right.

00:49:50.409 --> 00:49:57.409
But I think all of you would agree how much we enjoyed the museum video,

00:49:57.409 --> 00:50:05.409
and hearing Brother Fred Franz, his voice, talking about after the assassination of the Archduke,

00:50:05.409 --> 00:50:13.409
the brothers said, ah-ha, there it is. There it is, what we've been waiting for.

00:50:13.409 --> 00:50:18.409
Well, that's very stirring, and then we would have critics saying,

00:50:18.409 --> 00:50:25.409
you have it, you people had other expectations that were not realized, et cetera.

00:50:25.409 --> 00:50:33.409
But it's amazing that even the world recognized, this was unique, 1914.

00:50:33.409 --> 00:50:38.409
In fact, I've had this for many years when I show it to you.

00:50:38.409 --> 00:50:41.409
It's the New World magazine.

00:50:41.409 --> 00:50:46.409
And it was widely read at the time, and I guess I remember about 1931,

00:50:46.409 --> 00:50:52.409
they went out of business. But here, end of all kingdoms in 1914,

00:50:52.409 --> 00:50:56.409
millennial donors, 25-year prophecy.

00:50:56.409 --> 00:50:59.409
Widely read, other newspapers covered it.

00:50:59.409 --> 00:51:04.409
They made comments here about the terrific war I'll break in Europe

00:51:04.409 --> 00:51:07.409
has fulfilled an extraordinary prophecy.

00:51:07.409 --> 00:51:12.409
For a quarter of a century passed through preachers and through press,

00:51:12.409 --> 00:51:16.409
the international Bible students best known as millennial donors,

00:51:16.409 --> 00:51:23.409
have been proclaiming to the world that the day of wrath prophesied in the Bible would dawn in 1914.

00:51:23.409 --> 00:51:30.409
Look out for 1914 has been the cry of the hundreds of traveling evangelists.

00:51:30.409 --> 00:51:35.409
And I appreciate very much how the yearbook in 1975,

00:51:35.409 --> 00:51:40.409
considering our modern day history, made this beautiful quote,

00:51:40.409 --> 00:51:46.409
disappointments about going to heaven in 1914 really were very minor,

00:51:46.409 --> 00:51:52.409
compared with the great expectations realized in connection with that year.

00:51:52.409 --> 00:51:56.409
And it's amazing during the first six months of 1914, nothing happened.

00:51:56.409 --> 00:52:01.409
And they were being ridiculed, and then the Archduke is assassinated.

00:52:01.409 --> 00:52:07.409
This one was particularly released August 30th, 1914,

00:52:07.409 --> 00:52:11.409
millions dying in World War I.

00:52:11.409 --> 00:52:19.409
So it's Brother France's statement that really, if the idea for the theme here,

00:52:19.409 --> 00:52:22.409
this is it. The question arises,

00:52:22.409 --> 00:52:27.409
will we have one or more times in the future,

00:52:27.409 --> 00:52:30.409
or even not one we can say this is it?

00:52:30.409 --> 00:52:37.409
See, and have that same exciting fervor because of Bible prophecy.

00:52:37.409 --> 00:52:40.409
Well, let's begin with this one here.

00:52:40.409 --> 00:52:45.409
Find Daniel, chapter 11,

00:52:45.409 --> 00:52:54.610
and we're going to read here, verse 40,

00:52:54.610 --> 00:52:57.610
or half of it.

00:52:57.610 --> 00:53:03.949
In the time of the end, the King of the South, here in Daniel 1140,

00:53:03.949 --> 00:53:07.949
will engage with him in a pushing.

00:53:07.949 --> 00:53:16.489
So the governing body has been prayerfully considering recent events.

00:53:17.489 --> 00:53:23.489
And we know that in 1991, the Soviet Union came to an end.

00:53:23.489 --> 00:53:28.489
So who is the King of the North?

00:53:28.489 --> 00:53:31.489
Well, after prayerfully considering it,

00:53:31.489 --> 00:53:33.489
and the matter of the pushing,

00:53:33.489 --> 00:53:39.489
we're assuring you that what we see after prayerfully considering it,

00:53:39.489 --> 00:53:44.489
is that Russia and its allies, King of the North.

00:53:44.489 --> 00:53:47.489
Now, here's some reasoning.

00:53:47.489 --> 00:53:50.489
The Soviet Union just banded.

00:53:50.489 --> 00:53:54.489
Russia came up from the rubble of the Soviet Union,

00:53:54.489 --> 00:53:56.489
along with its allies.

00:53:56.489 --> 00:53:59.489
And here's some of the facts.

00:53:59.489 --> 00:54:03.489
Two things have become apparent.

00:54:03.489 --> 00:54:07.489
Russia and its allies are continuing to engage in a pushing

00:54:07.489 --> 00:54:09.489
with the King of the South,

00:54:09.489 --> 00:54:13.489
and we'll get to that pushing point shortly.

00:54:13.489 --> 00:54:16.489
And the second, they are taking the lead

00:54:16.489 --> 00:54:19.489
in persecuting and opposing God's people.

00:54:19.489 --> 00:54:23.489
And notice what the pushing includes.

00:54:23.489 --> 00:54:26.489
Electronic espionage.

00:54:26.489 --> 00:54:28.489
Computer attacks.

00:54:28.489 --> 00:54:30.489
Trade wars.

00:54:30.489 --> 00:54:32.489
And that's what they call them.

00:54:32.489 --> 00:54:36.489
And the hostile flooding into surrounding territory.

00:54:36.489 --> 00:54:40.489
These are recurring features of the news headlines.

00:54:40.489 --> 00:54:42.489
You're aware of them.

00:54:42.489 --> 00:54:45.489
So someone who has the King of the North been inactive?

00:54:45.489 --> 00:54:47.489
Well, no.

00:54:47.489 --> 00:54:51.489
It appears he's never been this busy with the pushing,

00:54:51.489 --> 00:54:53.489
with the King of the South.

00:54:53.489 --> 00:54:55.489
So this is it.

00:54:55.489 --> 00:54:58.489
At this point, we're confident to share with you Russia.

00:54:58.489 --> 00:55:01.489
And its allies are the King of the North.

00:55:01.489 --> 00:55:03.489
And they're engaged in this pushing.

00:55:03.489 --> 00:55:05.489
In fact, last month,

00:55:05.489 --> 00:55:08.489
they had the largest war games Russia did,

00:55:09.489 --> 00:55:12.489
since the Soviet Union was in existence,

00:55:12.489 --> 00:55:14.489
way back in the 80s.

00:55:14.489 --> 00:55:17.489
And they had their allies with them in the war game.

00:55:17.489 --> 00:55:21.489
So we're confident this is it.

00:55:21.489 --> 00:55:23.489
This is the King of the North.

00:55:23.489 --> 00:55:26.489
And that's what's involved at this time

00:55:26.489 --> 00:55:29.489
with the pushing, locking horns with each other.

00:55:29.489 --> 00:55:34.489
So there are going to be another time related to Bible prophecy

00:55:34.489 --> 00:55:37.489
where the faithful slave will be able to say to you,

00:55:37.489 --> 00:55:39.489
this is it.

00:55:39.489 --> 00:55:42.489
Well, one that we're all very familiar with,

00:55:42.489 --> 00:55:46.489
and especially this audience here in Newburg,

00:55:46.489 --> 00:55:48.489
you've been in the truth for decades.

00:55:48.489 --> 00:55:52.489
Notice the very familiar thoughts

00:55:52.489 --> 00:55:55.489
from 1 Thessalonians chapter five.

00:55:55.489 --> 00:56:01.489
And we're going to read verse two and verse three,

00:56:01.489 --> 00:56:05.090
five, two, and three.

00:56:05.090 --> 00:56:08.090
For you yourselves know very well that Jehovah's Day is coming

00:56:09.090 --> 00:56:12.090
exactly as a thief in the night.

00:56:12.090 --> 00:56:17.090
Whenever it is that they are saying peace and security,

00:56:18.090 --> 00:56:21.090
then sudden destruction is to be instantly on them,

00:56:21.090 --> 00:56:24.090
just like birth pains on a pregnant woman,

00:56:24.090 --> 00:56:28.090
and they will by no means escape.

00:56:28.090 --> 00:56:32.090
Now, so that we have the clear thinking,

00:56:32.090 --> 00:56:37.090
published comments regarding these two verses we read,

00:56:37.090 --> 00:56:42.090
we'll take you back to September 15th, 2012, Watchtower.

00:56:43.090 --> 00:56:45.090
Quoting, as used here,

00:56:45.090 --> 00:56:48.090
Jehovah's Day refers to the period

00:56:48.090 --> 00:56:51.090
that will start with the destruction of false religion

00:56:51.090 --> 00:56:55.090
and will culminate in the war of Armageddon.

00:56:55.090 --> 00:56:59.090
However, just before that day of Jehovah begins,

00:56:59.090 --> 00:57:03.090
world leaders will be saying peace and security.

00:57:04.090 --> 00:57:06.090
This may refer to one event

00:57:07.090 --> 00:57:09.090
or to a series of events.

00:57:09.090 --> 00:57:12.090
Nations may think they are close to solving

00:57:12.090 --> 00:57:14.090
some of their big problems.

00:57:15.090 --> 00:57:17.090
So here's the question,

00:57:17.090 --> 00:57:21.090
and it's understood that it would be asked,

00:57:21.090 --> 00:57:23.090
will the faithful slave be able to,

00:57:23.090 --> 00:57:26.090
at a certain time say to the brotherhood,

00:57:26.090 --> 00:57:29.369
this is it.

00:57:29.369 --> 00:57:31.369
This is what we've been waiting for.

00:57:31.369 --> 00:57:34.369
This is the peace and security prophecy.

00:57:36.369 --> 00:57:38.369
Well, keep this comment in mind

00:57:38.369 --> 00:57:41.369
from a Watchtower 2004,

00:57:41.369 --> 00:57:45.650
February 1st, page 21.

00:57:45.650 --> 00:57:49.650
Since Bible prophecies are often fully understood only

00:57:49.650 --> 00:57:51.650
after they are fulfilled

00:57:51.650 --> 00:57:55.650
or are in the process of fulfillment,

00:57:55.650 --> 00:57:57.650
isn't that interesting?

00:57:57.650 --> 00:57:59.650
So keep that in mind,

00:57:59.650 --> 00:58:00.650
we'll come back to it,

00:58:00.650 --> 00:58:03.650
and that happens to be the case,

00:58:03.650 --> 00:58:04.650
the prophecies will feel,

00:58:04.650 --> 00:58:06.650
oh, okay.

00:58:06.650 --> 00:58:09.650
We'll come back to that statement

00:58:09.650 --> 00:58:11.650
from the Watchtower shortly,

00:58:11.650 --> 00:58:14.650
but just consider, especially those of you here,

00:58:14.650 --> 00:58:17.650
many of you are aged,

00:58:17.650 --> 00:58:20.650
and you'll remember,

00:58:20.650 --> 00:58:22.650
many of you are in the truth at the time,

00:58:22.650 --> 00:58:25.650
what about the year 1986?

00:58:25.650 --> 00:58:29.650
See, the United Nations was proclaiming

00:58:29.650 --> 00:58:32.650
the prior to January of 1986

00:58:32.650 --> 00:58:35.650
that, you know, get ready,

00:58:35.650 --> 00:58:37.650
they wanted the governments

00:58:37.650 --> 00:58:40.650
to put their arms down for at least a year,

00:58:40.650 --> 00:58:43.650
international year of peace.

00:58:43.650 --> 00:58:45.650
Oh.

00:58:45.650 --> 00:58:47.650
See, if you were in the truth back then,

00:58:47.650 --> 00:58:50.650
they were like, okay.

00:58:50.650 --> 00:58:52.650
So they were all big facts.

00:58:52.650 --> 00:58:56.650
The Pope at that time gathered all these religious leaders

00:58:56.650 --> 00:58:58.650
over there to assist the Italy,

00:58:58.650 --> 00:59:00.650
and they're all over their pran

00:59:00.650 --> 00:59:02.650
to who they pray to,

00:59:02.650 --> 00:59:07.650
and having this fervor for peace for the earth.

00:59:07.650 --> 00:59:10.650
Well, how did the faithful slave handle all that?

00:59:10.650 --> 00:59:12.650
See.

00:59:12.650 --> 00:59:15.650
So this honors Jehovah's faithful slave

00:59:15.650 --> 00:59:17.650
serving at that time.

00:59:17.650 --> 00:59:20.650
Here's what was published in the 85 Watchtower,

00:59:20.650 --> 00:59:22.650
October 1st, page 18.

00:59:22.650 --> 00:59:24.650
Oh, this is some months before

00:59:24.650 --> 00:59:27.650
that all started in 1986.

00:59:27.650 --> 00:59:29.650
Here's what was stated.

00:59:29.650 --> 00:59:32.650
Christians cannot say in advance exactly

00:59:32.650 --> 00:59:36.650
when the Great Tribulation will strike, period.

00:59:36.650 --> 00:59:40.650
Jehovah has not revealed that day or the hour.

00:59:40.650 --> 00:59:42.650
Thus, when, for example,

00:59:42.650 --> 00:59:45.650
the United Nations declares the year 1986

00:59:45.650 --> 00:59:48.650
an international year of peace,

00:59:48.650 --> 00:59:51.650
Christians watch the event with interest,

00:59:51.650 --> 00:59:54.650
but they cannot say in advance

00:59:54.650 --> 00:59:58.650
where this will prove to be the fulfillment of Paul's words.

00:59:58.650 --> 01:00:00.650
Nonetheless, we kept on the watch,

01:00:00.650 --> 01:00:02.650
but God's Spirit was guiding His people

01:00:02.650 --> 01:00:05.650
particularly the faithful slave.

01:00:05.650 --> 01:00:07.650
They were not only faithful,

01:00:07.650 --> 01:00:09.650
they were discreet, and they did not say,

01:00:09.650 --> 01:00:11.650
this is it.

01:00:11.650 --> 01:00:14.650
This is the fulfillment of 1st Esalonians.

01:00:14.650 --> 01:00:16.650
Chapter 5, no.

01:00:16.650 --> 01:00:17.650
See.

01:00:17.650 --> 01:00:22.650
But if you're still there, go back to 1st Esalonians chapter 5,

01:00:22.650 --> 01:00:25.650
it's just something to keep in mind here that

01:00:25.650 --> 01:00:31.280
sometimes we'll read verse 2 and 3 and leave out verse 4.

01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:33.280
He writes, but you, brothers,

01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:37.280
you are not in darkness,

01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:40.280
so that that day should overtake you as it would thieves.

01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:44.280
So thieves are doing their thievery when it's dark,

01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:46.280
but we're sons of light.

01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:49.280
So that's not going to catch us.

01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:52.280
The faithful ones worshipping the true God,

01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:56.280
obedient to this earthly part of His organization.

01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:59.280
So the question comes up,

01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:03.280
if you go back to that quote from 2004 Watchtower,

01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:07.280
see, prophecies are only fully understood,

01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:09.280
only after they are fulfilled,

01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:14.280
but we also said, or are in the process of fulfillment.

01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:20.690
So will the faithful slave be able to say

01:01:20.690 --> 01:01:24.690
in the process of the fulfillment of this prophecy

01:01:24.690 --> 01:01:26.690
from 1st Esalonians?

01:01:26.690 --> 01:01:27.690
This is it.

01:01:27.690 --> 01:01:32.190
That's what we've been waiting for.

01:01:32.190 --> 01:01:34.190
We'll have to wait and see.

01:01:34.190 --> 01:01:39.659
So, but there's a word of caution here.

01:01:39.659 --> 01:01:42.659
I want to pass on to you because we're all human.

01:01:42.659 --> 01:01:45.659
We must keep on the watch, but please,

01:01:45.659 --> 01:01:47.659
just don't be gullible.

01:01:47.659 --> 01:01:50.659
You hear a world leader say something about peace

01:01:50.659 --> 01:01:54.659
and then they start emailing or something else

01:01:54.659 --> 01:01:56.659
with social network.

01:01:56.659 --> 01:02:00.579
This is it.

01:02:00.579 --> 01:02:04.579
See, leave the channel to handle such matters.

01:02:04.579 --> 01:02:07.579
If the faithful slave is moved by God's spirit

01:02:07.579 --> 01:02:10.579
to say that to the brotherhood,

01:02:10.579 --> 01:02:12.579
and that's His will, fine.

01:02:12.579 --> 01:02:14.579
But please don't be gullible.

01:02:14.579 --> 01:02:18.579
Stick with the way your home wants this to operate

01:02:18.579 --> 01:02:21.579
and he'll bless your obedience.

01:02:21.579 --> 01:02:24.579
Now, you'll remember Jehovah's Day begins

01:02:24.579 --> 01:02:27.579
as they're saying peace and security.

01:02:27.579 --> 01:02:31.579
Turn to Revelation chapter 17.

01:02:31.579 --> 01:02:35.579
I would stirring words or familiar with,

01:02:35.579 --> 01:02:38.579
but it does nourish our figurative hearts

01:02:38.579 --> 01:02:41.579
when we read these.

01:02:41.579 --> 01:02:48.579
Chapter 17, verses 15, 16, and 17.

01:02:49.579 --> 01:02:52.579
He said to me, the waters that you saw were the prostitute,

01:02:52.579 --> 01:02:55.579
the world empire, false religion is sitting,

01:02:55.579 --> 01:02:58.579
mean peoples and crowds and nations and tongues.

01:02:58.579 --> 01:03:01.579
And the ten horns that you saw on the wild beast,

01:03:01.579 --> 01:03:03.579
these will hate the prostitute.

01:03:03.579 --> 01:03:06.579
They will make her devastated and naked,

01:03:06.579 --> 01:03:10.579
and they will eat up her flesh and completely burn her with fire.

01:03:10.579 --> 01:03:13.579
For God put it into their hearts to carry out His thought,

01:03:13.579 --> 01:03:16.579
yes, to carry out their one thought

01:03:16.579 --> 01:03:18.579
by giving their kingdom to the wild beast

01:03:18.579 --> 01:03:22.579
until the words of God will have been accomplished.

01:03:22.579 --> 01:03:25.579
Now, this is what's going to happen.

01:03:25.579 --> 01:03:29.579
And when you think about it, this is just mind-boggling.

01:03:29.579 --> 01:03:32.579
They have no plans as such.

01:03:32.579 --> 01:03:35.579
The government's at this point.

01:03:35.579 --> 01:03:40.579
So Jehovah forces one part of Satan's system

01:03:40.579 --> 01:03:44.579
to destroy another part.

01:03:44.579 --> 01:03:47.579
Only the Almighty God can do that.

01:03:47.579 --> 01:03:51.579
So when they do destroy battle on the Great

01:03:51.579 --> 01:03:55.579
and all of this is taking place on the Earth,

01:03:55.579 --> 01:04:01.139
you brothers are not going to need a breaking news update

01:04:01.139 --> 01:04:03.139
around the globe you're going to say,

01:04:03.139 --> 01:04:09.139
this is it, the Great Tribulation has started.

01:04:09.139 --> 01:04:14.139
And frankly, for those that worry sometimes,

01:04:14.139 --> 01:04:18.139
during the Great Tribulation as these events unfold,

01:04:18.139 --> 01:04:21.139
you're not going to be terrified.

01:04:21.139 --> 01:04:25.139
No, you're going to stand up straight,

01:04:25.139 --> 01:04:29.139
lift your heads up and say,

01:04:29.139 --> 01:05:01.900
this is it, our deliverance is here.

01:05:01.900 --> 01:05:04.900
Thank you very much, brother Morris,

01:05:04.900 --> 01:05:07.900
for heightening our eagerness

01:05:07.900 --> 01:05:10.900
for what lies ahead in the near future

01:05:10.900 --> 01:05:15.900
and thank you for removing the veil from the King of the North.
