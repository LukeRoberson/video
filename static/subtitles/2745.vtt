00:00:01.229 --> 00:00:09.230
I didn't identify myself as one of Jehovah's Witnesses because I was scared of what kids at school would say about me.

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:16.230
P pressure probably is probably the worst one because you know you don't get just P pressure from friends but you also get it from you know your teachers.

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:24.230
Some of my friends who joined this new Christian group started spreading false rumors about Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:29.230
Many of them said we were led by some unknown leader at the top.

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:38.229
At first I wanted to stand up and say well that's not true. However I started becoming fearful.

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:45.229
I was hanging out with the wrong crowd and girls invited me to go play in the park after school.

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:55.229
Something kind of told me that I shouldn't have gone with them but I still went and out of nowhere I see two young men come and they try to steal our backpacks.

00:00:55.229 --> 00:01:00.229
They started arguing with the boys in our group and they started fighting too.

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:06.230
The police came and when I saw the police I thought I was going to get into a lot of trouble so I just ran away.

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:13.230
One time the teacher at school was mocking all religions saying you know the Bible is outdated.

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:18.230
You know how you know God exists you know people have rewritten it so many times how you know it's the truth.

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:23.230
And I remember thinking to myself I should say something you know I did this night before I should say something.

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:27.230
And then my friend goes next me goes Bianca's the Jehovah's Witness.

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:34.230
The teacher looked to me you know wide open goes you have anything to say and I just stood there you know you know what to say.

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:38.230
And then the bell rang and I was just like relieved.

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:42.230
I felt how I imagined Peter would have felt.

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:47.230
My conscience kept bothering me and I knew that Jehovah didn't approve of my association.

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:51.230
The fact that I had to open my mouth and kind of prove myself.

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:57.230
You know just cramped up inside and I felt very disappointed in myself.

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:05.230
I made a prayer to Jehovah and I asked him to give me courage to stand up and say that I was one of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:17.229
I remember a brother gave a talk once and he cited from the words of Mark 838 where it says that we shouldn't be ashamed of following Jesus because he would be ashamed of us.

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:22.229
Those words really touched my heart and I knew that I had to make changes soon.

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:33.229
After I had considered the example of Jesus I prayed to Jehovah one for courage and also for another opportunity to defend his name.

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:42.229
And talking to mum was probably the biggest one. Her experience and her knowledge kind of helped me to give me the courage to keep going.

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:48.229
Identifying myself as one of Jehovah's Witnesses has served as a protection.

00:02:48.229 --> 00:03:00.229
In biology class we were talking about topic of blood and my teacher brought up the comment of those day W people that they would let their kids die.

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:09.229
I said a really quick prayer to Jehovah because I knew that was not the truth so I stood up and I said we called Jehovah's Witnesses and we don't allow our kids to die.

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:11.229
I was so happy after that moment.

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:18.229
I was able to give a witness when my schoolmate started asking me about what we really believe and practice.

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:25.229
And I was able to give them a much more accurate understanding of how our organization functions.

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:30.229
Now that I'm able to stand firm in my beliefs I feel much better.

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:35.229
You're doing it for Jehovah and you're doing it for yourself. You're not doing it to make them happy, doing it to make Jehovah happy.

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:42.229
When I feel scared or afraid I say quick prayer to Jehovah and he gives me the courage to defend my faith and keep going on.

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:46.229
I have gained the respect and admiration of my schoolmates.

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:51.229
I'm not ashamed anymore. I identify myself as one of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:54.229
And now I'm proud to represent Jehovah.
