But that was a really nice job you did on your talk. Yeah, good job. Thanks guys

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.539
With Jehovah's help it came together believe me. I've been so busy

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.059
It was just it was hard to make time to prepare it

00:00:24.059 --> 00:00:24.899

00:00:24.899 --> 00:00:30.260

I was able to show one of our JW dot org videos with a man

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.500
He said I can come back this Saturday. I think he might even agree to a study you want to come with me Alex

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.179
You know, I'm sorry. I'm gonna be tied up for most of this Saturday
