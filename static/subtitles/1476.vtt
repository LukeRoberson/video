00:00:01.899 --> 00:00:19.320
When the Apostle Paul was busy preaching in the bustling city of Corinth, the

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:26.039
account at Acts 18 verse 5 says that Paul began to be intensely occupied with

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.399
the Word, or as the study note in the New Royal translation puts it, fully

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:39.179
absorbed in preaching the Word. Those words well describe the thousands of

00:00:39.179 --> 00:00:46.299
brothers and sisters serving today as special pioneers. Just like Paul, they

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:52.340
are fully absorbed in their ministry. They spend about a hundred hours in service

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:59.380
every month. With limited time for secular work, they receive a modest allowance

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:05.140
to help with their expenses. Most of us are familiar with regular and

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:11.260
auxiliary pioneers, perhaps you serve as one. But what makes this special

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:17.739
pioneer arrangement unique? In this report, let's look at the important role

00:01:17.739 --> 00:01:24.180
special pioneers have played and continue to play in supporting and expanding

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:30.099
the disciple-making work and consider what we can do to support these dear

00:01:30.099 --> 00:01:39.569
faithful ones. The special pioneer arrangement began more than 85 years ago at

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:46.969
the 1937 Convention in Columbus, Ohio. Brother Rutherford explained that a group

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:55.969
of about 200 pioneers were being chosen to serve as special pioneers. Their

00:01:55.969 --> 00:02:01.530
assignment was to take the lead in using one of the most powerful preaching

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:19.050
tools of the year. The portable phonogram. By this time, brothers had been using

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:24.849
phonographs to play short Bible messages for a few years. But usually only

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:30.849
after being invited inside someone's home. The newly appointed special

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:37.490
pioneers were to spearhead a new use of the phonograph, presenting the

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:44.090
recorded messages right on the householder's doorstep after just a few words of

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:50.930
introduction. Before long, tens of thousands of phonographs were in use in the

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:56.689
field. Special pioneers also took the lead in following up with interested

00:02:56.689 --> 00:03:01.569
persons and conducting Bible studies, and they focused mainly on preaching in

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:07.449
big cities. But within a few years, the scope was expanded. Their assignment

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:13.490
would now include remote territories. As a result of the tireless work of those

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:19.849
intrepid special pioneers, hundreds of new congregations were formed. Today,

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:25.770
that initial group of 200 special pioneers has grown to more than 27,000, and

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:31.250
they continue to play a key role in opening up new territories all over the

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:38.629
world. Some who served faithfully for many years at Bethel or in other forms of

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:42.669
special full-time service, such as the circuit work, are assigned as special

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:49.349
pioneers. Their experience and zeal are a real benefit to their congregations.

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:54.629
Well, after serving at Bethel for over 30 years, Laurie and I received the call

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:58.909
from the branch office that we were being reassigned as special pioneers to the

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:04.310
field. And when we met with them, it was a little emotional. We knew there was

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:09.669
good possibility. However, it was Jehovah's direction. We took a picture with

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:15.469
them afterwards. We have that as a really nice memory aid of the new chapter of

00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:20.790
our life. When they moved in, it seemed like they adopted all the young ones in

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:28.389
the congregation. And in doing so, they have actually improved their zeal and

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:34.310
participation in the ministry as well. Jehovah is using us in a way that allows us

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:39.350
to be able to assist a congregation. And at the same time, this congregation is

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:44.550
taking care and strengthening and helping us. And when we get the focus off of

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:50.870
ourselves and onto them and to those that are in the field, immediately Jehovah

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:58.550
blesses us with joy. They have taken that mindset of working hard for Jehovah at

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:04.389
Bethel and now really transitioning to working hard for Jehovah in the

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:10.269
Macedonian congregation. Do you have special pioneers in your congregation or

00:05:10.269 --> 00:05:17.589
circuit? If so, spend time with them. Parents, help your young ones come to know

00:05:17.589 --> 00:05:25.509
them. All of us can let them know how much we appreciate their example of faith.

00:05:25.509 --> 00:05:30.149
Special pioneers are willing to serve wherever they are needed in their own

00:05:30.149 --> 00:05:36.589
country or in some cases in other lands. So how does someone become a special

00:05:36.589 --> 00:05:42.550
pioneer? Well, in most cases, it begins when a regular pioneer attends the school

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:48.310
for kingdom evangelizers. Based on the needs of the field, some graduates of

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:53.029
the school are appointed as temporary special pioneers for up to three years.

00:05:53.029 --> 00:05:58.829
Afterward, some might continue as special pioneers or be invited to serve as

00:05:58.829 --> 00:06:04.230
field missionaries. When I first heard that I was assigned as a temporary

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:09.990
special pioneer, I was shocked. I was a little bit scared, very overwhelmed, but

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:14.589
mostly excited. I've really enjoyed being available for the friends, being

00:06:14.589 --> 00:06:18.750
available for different service times for phone calls or things like that.

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:23.149
It's just really been nice to support the congregation with more of my time.

00:06:23.149 --> 00:06:30.629
I would call it the experience that we never knew we wanted because I never

00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:35.790
never thought that it could be a goal of ours, never thought we would do it,

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:41.470
didn't understand or know too much about it. Because it's called special pioneer,

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:45.509
I think in our heads, before we're like all special people do that, they're just

00:06:45.509 --> 00:06:50.550
really incredible at the ministry. So that's who special pioneers. So to get this

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:56.709
assignment, we're like, oh, regular people can be special pioneers. So really, the

00:06:56.709 --> 00:07:01.829
School for Kingdom Evangelizers has become an essential doorway for those

00:07:01.829 --> 00:07:06.790
wanting to be used more fully by Jehovah's organization. The School for Kingdom

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:11.269
Evangelizers was like a power station that gave us strength to continue in our

00:07:11.269 --> 00:07:15.550
ministry. The two month of training really helped me to be more fluent in the

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:19.750
pure language, and I felt newfound strength when I returned to preach in the

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:24.310
foreign language field after graduation. Not only does it provide you with the

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:29.509
training, but it helps you to be able to get even closer to Jehovah more than

00:07:29.509 --> 00:07:34.230
you had ever imagined before. Because the School for Kingdom Evangelizers, we

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:38.389
imagine we're gonna be practicing preaching every day, but the School just

00:07:38.389 --> 00:07:42.949
helped us with our relationship with Jehovah. We felt so built up, we would go

00:07:42.949 --> 00:07:49.189
anywhere. Naturally, many would prefer to choose their own assignment. However,

00:07:49.189 --> 00:07:54.470
when we put ourselves in Jehovah's hands through his organization, we receive

00:07:54.470 --> 00:08:01.029
valuable training and find the best place to grow spiritually. We feel great joy

00:08:01.029 --> 00:08:05.670
in finding language service where we express Jehovah's love and goodness to

00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:12.790
foreigners who's been through so much in this tough world. I am really happy

00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:17.189
because although I'm physically in Korea, it feels like I'm doing missionary work.

00:08:17.189 --> 00:08:21.189
I love my assignment very, very much. There's just a tremendous amount of joy

00:08:21.189 --> 00:08:26.949
and blessings that come about in serving others. Special pioneering is

00:08:26.949 --> 00:08:33.590
really the best life ever, but just to be able to give your all to Jehovah in

00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:43.799
every way. I'm excited to see where Jehovah wants me next.

00:08:43.799 --> 00:08:49.720
As we've just seen with many recent SKE graduates being assigned to the work,

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:56.759
special pioneering isn't out of reach for young couples or single ones, even those in their

00:08:56.759 --> 00:09:03.320
20s. And there is a real need for more to serve in this special capacity.

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:10.039
So, you younger brothers and sisters, could you set special pioneering as a goal?

00:09:11.639 --> 00:09:17.720
It can give you the training and experience you'll need to be more useful to Jehovah.

00:09:18.679 --> 00:09:26.440
You would find it to be a wonderful career. Of course, not all of us can be special pioneers,

00:09:27.159 --> 00:09:35.159
but we can support them and their efforts, their steadfastness, determination, and zeal

00:09:35.159 --> 00:09:43.320
make them a real treasure. To all of our special pioneers, we echo the words of the Apostle Paul

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:50.840
to the Thessalonians when he wrote, we continually remember your faithful work, your loving

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:59.559
labors, and your endurance.
