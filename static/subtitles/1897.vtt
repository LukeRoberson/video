WEBVTT

00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:03.710
Welcome, everyone.

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:09.070
In this update, I thought we might reflect on Jehovah's goodness and the way he's been

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:11.750
guiding his people during the pandemic.

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:18.989
I'm sure we all agree with the words of the Psalmist found at Psalm 27 and verse 13,

00:00:18.989 --> 00:00:28.149
where would I be if I did not have faith that I would see Jehovah's goodness in the land

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:29.750
of the living?

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:31.870
Where would I be?

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:34.350
That's something to think about, isn't it?

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.390
How grateful we are to be associated with Jehovah's organization and to benefit from

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:46.310
its direction and guidance, especially when we see where we could be in the confused

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:50.270
and divided world around us.

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:56.549
With your eyes of faith, do you see Jehovah as directing his people today?

00:00:57.549 --> 00:01:04.230
Now we know he's interested in our spiritual well-being, but what about our physical well-being,

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:05.230
our health?

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:08.469
Does he care about that?

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:15.829
If he does, will he make sure that we get good advice, even on health matters?

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:23.349
To answer that, let's consider the promised Jehovah made as found at Psalm 32 and verse

00:01:23.349 --> 00:01:24.349
8.

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.030
We know well, but let's look at this from another perspective.

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.829
This is Psalm 32 and verse 8.

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:40.349
He says, I will give you insight and instruct you in the way you should go.

00:01:40.349 --> 00:01:46.829
I will give you advice with my eye upon you.

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:52.790
So here's a promise, the Jehovah will give us the advice we need, but advice on what

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.950
subject?

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.790
Think back to the days of Israel.

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:02.430
Was Jehovah interested in the health and safety of his people back then?

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.390
He certainly was.

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.189
He instructed the Israelites to quarantine the sick.

00:02:08.189 --> 00:02:12.990
He told them not to eat unclean birds and animals because doing so could have been harmful

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.990
for their health.

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:19.789
And he insisted that they build a parapet around the flat roof of their homes, so no one

00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:21.629
would fall off.

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:23.870
He loved his people.

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.189
He wanted them to be safe.

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:29.469
Jehovah hasn't changed.

00:02:29.469 --> 00:02:32.909
He still cares about the health and safety of his people.

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:42.389
Now in the Psalm we just read, he promised to give us insight, instruction and advice.

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:45.150
How does he do that today?

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.310
He does it by means of his organization.

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.469
In some countries, there's been considerable confusion and disagreement over how to deal

00:02:55.469 --> 00:02:57.629
with the pandemic.

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:03.550
Some chave at the idea of wearing masks, and they refuse to practice physical distancing

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.110
even when these precautions are required.

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:11.990
A reminder to Paul's words at 1 Corinthians 14 and 33.

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:13.949
Remember that one?

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:18.629
God is not a God of disorder, but of peace, the Bible says.

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:25.830
The disorder we see in the world is proof positive that Jehovah is not with them.

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:31.270
But from Jehovah's organization, we've had clear direction from the very beginning.

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:34.789
And we thank Jehovah for it.

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:41.189
For example, think of the information we've received through recent governing body updates.

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:46.270
This is evidence of Jehovah's love and direction, his goodness.

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:50.629
In last month's update, Brother Lat made a very important point.

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:55.430
He reminded us that the information we're receiving regarding the pandemic is prepared

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.349
by faithful brothers.

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:00.229
We can trust them.

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:04.990
They aren't motivated by some personal view or political agenda.

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:06.469
They love us.

00:04:06.469 --> 00:04:10.069
They want the best for us.

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:13.909
I hear someone ask, what do they know?

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:15.750
Wrong question.

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:20.829
I think the right question is, what does Jehovah know?

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:23.149
It comes down to this, friends.

00:04:23.149 --> 00:04:28.949
Do I really believe that Jehovah is directing this organization today?

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:34.629
Do I believe that Jehovah will give insight to his faithful people so they can remain

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:38.550
in the land of the living, as the Psalmist said?

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:46.079
To repeat the question we often raise in field service, does God really care?

00:04:46.079 --> 00:04:52.040
Would Jehovah allow the governing body, the helpers, missionaries, huge percentage of

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:57.639
the worldwide Bethel family and other full-time servants to engage in practices or receive

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:01.399
a COVID-19 vaccine that would be harmful?

00:05:01.399 --> 00:05:06.920
Surely, Jehovah wants the brothers at World Headquarters to continue providing spiritual

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:08.399
food.

00:05:08.399 --> 00:05:13.519
He wants to make sure that the work continues at our branch offices and in the field.

00:05:13.519 --> 00:05:18.279
To do that, we have to be in the land of the living.

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:24.040
And what about the prophecy that a great crowd, which no man can number, will come out

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.639
of the great tribulation?

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:31.720
Our God is definitely not like Pharaoh, who wanted to kill off an entire generation

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:34.399
of Jehovah's worshipers.

00:05:34.399 --> 00:05:41.519
We are convinced that Jehovah cares about the health and safety of his people, and that

00:05:41.519 --> 00:05:50.149
he will guide us, saying in effect, this is the way, walk in it, your people.

00:05:50.149 --> 00:05:55.550
When we embark on a certain course, we always look for evidence of Jehovah's blessing

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:58.670
to see whether we're on the right track or not.

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:04.509
So has Jehovah blessed our efforts during this pandemic?

00:06:04.509 --> 00:06:06.509
Yes, indeed.

00:06:06.509 --> 00:06:11.829
Well, of course, the pandemic has slowed activities for many of our brothers, especially

00:06:11.829 --> 00:06:14.829
in areas without good internet connections.

00:06:14.829 --> 00:06:18.550
Think of everything you've accomplished in recent months.

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:24.310
Many congregations are reporting record attendances at our virtual congregation meetings.

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:29.230
Inactive ones are returning to Jehovah, and how we thank God for that.

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:40.350
Our memorial attendance for 2021 reached an all-time peak of 21,367,603.

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:47.670
And many branches have reported new all-time peaks in the number of publishers, but that's

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:48.670
not all.

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:54.910
You've shown exemplary concern and brotherly affection for one another, proving that

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:58.709
you truly are Christ's disciples.

00:06:58.709 --> 00:07:02.310
We commend you most warmly.

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:08.029
Who can deny that Jehovah is blessing your work?

00:07:09.029 --> 00:07:13.550
Consider what the Bethel family has been able to accomplish during the pandemic, only

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:15.629
with Jehovah's blessing.

00:07:15.629 --> 00:07:20.389
We all appreciate our beautiful new publication and joy life forever.

00:07:20.389 --> 00:07:26.509
That was a tremendous amount of work, involving hundreds of hours of overtime.

00:07:26.509 --> 00:07:29.790
But that's not all that was accomplished during the pandemic.

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:32.149
What about the monthly broadcasts?

00:07:32.149 --> 00:07:34.350
We never missed one.

00:07:34.829 --> 00:07:40.910
Then there are the beautiful videos, our regional conventions, the Gilead graduations,

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:43.069
and the annual meetings.

00:07:43.069 --> 00:07:51.019
All of this was possible because the Bethel family stayed healthy.

00:07:51.019 --> 00:07:55.459
Many brothers and sisters have written to express appreciation for knowing what precautions

00:07:55.459 --> 00:07:58.060
were taking at world headquarters.

00:07:58.060 --> 00:07:59.660
Why?

00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:01.459
Simple.

00:08:01.459 --> 00:08:06.220
When you think of another group in Jehovah's organization that would be more at risk of

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:12.980
infection than the Bethel family, hundreds of us live together, work together, eat together,

00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:16.459
share the same surfaces day in and day out.

00:08:16.459 --> 00:08:21.899
So many brothers and sisters have concluded that what works for the Bethel family is likely

00:08:21.899 --> 00:08:24.819
to work for them.

00:08:24.819 --> 00:08:28.899
And now we're moving into another phase of the pandemic.

00:08:29.379 --> 00:08:34.899
Wasn't it exciting to see the recent JW news article about the pilot program to resume

00:08:34.899 --> 00:08:38.179
in-person congregation meetings in selected lands?

00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:42.340
It's been a long time since we've been able to be together in person.

00:08:44.019 --> 00:08:47.299
You might be wondering what led up to the pilot program?

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:55.539
Governing body committees have been prayerfully evaluating when and how to resume in-person meetings safely.

00:08:56.500 --> 00:09:00.659
Earlier this year, it didn't seem to be the right time to start.

00:09:01.539 --> 00:09:04.340
Vaccines weren't available in many lands.

00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:09.779
Infectured rates were high, and the Delta variant was rapidly spreading.

00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:18.259
But in September, the situation started to appear more hopeful, at least in some areas of the world.

00:09:18.659 --> 00:09:28.259
In October, 17 branches were approved to participate in a pilot program to resume in-person congregation meetings.

00:09:28.259 --> 00:09:33.460
These branches represent a variety of circumstances and continents.

00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:39.860
Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, North and South America.

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:46.259
Now the branch committees in all these countries need to consider carefully what the local government regulations are,

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:50.980
for such indoor gatherings as our congregation meetings.

00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:54.419
The regulations vary from country to country.

00:09:56.259 --> 00:10:00.980
You might be wondering, does this mean that Zoom is going away?

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:08.659
We're pleased to inform you that approval has been given for congregations in the pilot program

00:10:08.659 --> 00:10:14.659
to have the option of holding hybrid meetings, where some attend in person at the Kingdom Hall,

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:17.620
while others are tied in via Zoom.

00:10:18.419 --> 00:10:23.299
As of November 8th, 14 branches have already held their first meetings.

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:29.059
As you can imagine, our brothers and sisters were overjoyed to meet together again.

00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:31.379
That's here from a few of them.

00:10:34.179 --> 00:10:38.500
When it was announced at the midweek meeting that our congregation had been invited to hold

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:44.019
in-person meetings as part of a project, I was so happy that I jumped out of my chair for joy.

00:10:44.019 --> 00:10:45.379
It was a tremendous emotion.

00:10:48.139 --> 00:10:51.740
I couldn't believe it that it was actually happening all of a sudden out of nowhere.

00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:56.139
We're coming back and we walk in the hall and you're like, these are all my brothers and sisters

00:10:56.139 --> 00:10:58.860
and we're all together. You just felt like you were at home.

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:10.779
Being far back at the meetings, I feel like the fire is burning in my heart because of happiness.

00:11:15.669 --> 00:11:21.269
It really felt good. It was lovely to see the brothers and sisters coming into the entrance

00:11:21.269 --> 00:11:23.669
way and to greet them. It was so great.

00:11:25.269 --> 00:11:30.309
I wanted to go and give somebody a very big hug, but since I couldn't,

00:11:30.309 --> 00:11:35.830
I would go to mom and dad and hug them and say, this is for this person.

00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:48.889
Being able to be at the Kingdom Hall, I had to pitch myself to make sure I'm not dreaming.

00:11:50.889 --> 00:11:55.850
Many amohenel on the way there were really excited and when we finally went inside,

00:11:55.850 --> 00:12:00.490
seeing the friends hugging them, it was really an indescribable feeling.

00:12:09.129 --> 00:12:13.370
To hear the singing even with the mask on, it was really encouraging.

00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:23.850
I love the singing. I think everyone got better over the 18 months so we got to practice. It was

00:12:24.649 --> 00:12:58.340
beautiful. It felt like going home to my family. Being able to sing together with

00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:06.419
brothers and sisters in person, being able to stretch my hand again, we all in our congregation

00:13:06.419 --> 00:13:15.750
were delighted to be part of it. Being at home is more comfortable, but you can be distracted by

00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:21.990
any little thing. But being here is much better because we pay more attention to the meetings.

00:13:35.769 --> 00:13:42.090
I was baptized in 2020 during the regional convention. It's not over yet since I got baptized.

00:13:43.049 --> 00:13:46.649
But this is my first time at the Kingdom Hall as a baptized brother.

00:13:48.779 --> 00:13:55.100
Since it is my first time at the Hall in a meeting in person, I felt so happy and also nervous

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:57.820
because I had to meet the brothers and sisters in person.

00:13:59.259 --> 00:14:04.139
I knew some of the older ones were a little bit apprehensive about coming to the meetings,

00:14:04.139 --> 00:14:10.379
but there they were at the meeting, lawyer attending and they actually was a very encouraging

00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:23.210
experience. Going back to the Kingdom Hall and seeing my brothers and sisters was something

00:14:24.409 --> 00:14:32.090
so beautiful, hearing their voices live no longer from a computer, seeing their eyes sparkling

00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:38.330
with joy, shiny with emotion made me feel an extraordinary emotion inside the heart.

00:14:40.789 --> 00:14:45.190
The whole that has been taking good care of us through the governing body and now that we got

00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:50.470
the chance to experience this, we're very thankful for the opportunity to serve Jehovah to meet

00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:57.429
together. It's been very, very nice. Making together with brothers and sisters

00:14:57.429 --> 00:15:06.149
is what Jehovah God wants. Jehovah created us for that, to be together, to live in unity.

00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:14.299
It was an up building experience. It was beautiful because it strengthened the spirit of belonging

00:15:14.299 --> 00:15:23.940
that we find only in Jehovah's people. And that's why I can only say thank you, thank you,

00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:37.539
thank you Jehovah. Well, that was exciting, wasn't it? If you're like me, I'm sure we're all

00:15:37.539 --> 00:15:44.179
anxious to get back to these in-person meetings. Based on the results of this pilot program,

00:15:44.179 --> 00:15:49.139
we hope that additional congregations can be approved to resume in-person meetings in the months ahead.

00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:56.500
In the meantime, we can continue to pray for Jehovah's guidance and blessing on these

00:15:56.500 --> 00:16:05.059
arrangements. So, dear friends, let's keep focusing our eyes on the one who is invisible,

00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:11.220
trusting that our God loves us and that he will never allow his people to come to harm.

00:16:12.259 --> 00:16:17.940
May Jehovah continue to bless you all richly. From the world headquarters of Jehovah's

00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:27.940
Witnesses, this is J.W. Braun Casting.
