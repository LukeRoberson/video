WEBVTT

00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:06.870
This is song 143, light in a darkened world.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:01:10.670
Shines of light we can see of His own smile.

00:01:10.670 --> 00:02:45.180
The attendance.

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.180
We're going to give you the combined attendance

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:54.180
at all of the venues, and it is a good figure.

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:01.180
21,689 are tied in with us today.

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:12.590
Please be seated.

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.580
An important announcement was recently made

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.580
to Bethel family's worldwide regarding a reduction

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.580
and simplification of our work at Bethel

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.580
and also in the field.

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.580
Now you may have heard something about it,

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.580
but what are the facts?

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.580
Well, we've invited the coordinator

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.580
of the publishing committee here,

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:38.580
and brother Samuel Hurd is going to read an announcement

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.580
that will clarify matters for us.

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.889
It was quite a trip getting over here

00:03:44.889 --> 00:04:01.259
from broadcasting.

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:05.259
Not really, I came from the back here.

00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:06.259
Here is the announcement.

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:09.259
On Wednesday, September the 23rd, 2015,

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:13.259
the worldwide Bethel family was informed

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:15.259
of a number of adjustments that are being made

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:21.259
in order to make the best use of dedicated funds.

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:23.259
At this time, we would like to make you

00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:26.259
dear brothers and sisters aware of some

00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:28.259
of these adjustments.

00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:33.259
The governing body has directed that a number of our branch

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:36.259
and assembly hall construction projects

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:41.259
worldwide, be delayed, reduced in scope,

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:46.259
or in some cases, cancelled.

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:50.259
However, kingdom halls will continue to be built

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:54.259
or renovated in proportion to whatever the brothers

00:04:54.259 --> 00:04:58.259
are able to contribute for this purpose.

00:04:58.259 --> 00:05:01.259
In addition, all branches have been asked

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:07.259
to reduce the size of their Bethel family.

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:11.819
We will continue to support special pioneers

00:05:11.819 --> 00:05:16.819
and temporary special pioneers in developing lands.

00:05:16.819 --> 00:05:20.819
However, in more affluent countries,

00:05:20.819 --> 00:05:22.819
where a large number of regular pioneers

00:05:22.819 --> 00:05:25.819
are zealously engaged in the preaching work,

00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:29.819
the number of temporary special pioneers

00:05:29.819 --> 00:05:34.819
will be reduced significantly.

00:05:34.819 --> 00:05:36.819
There will also be some reduction

00:05:36.819 --> 00:05:41.819
in the number of special pioneers.

00:05:41.819 --> 00:05:44.819
We feel sure that many regular pioneers

00:05:44.819 --> 00:05:47.819
will be willing to move to the areas

00:05:47.819 --> 00:05:51.819
where temporary special pioneers were formally assigned,

00:05:51.819 --> 00:05:57.819
so that the kingdom work will continue unabated.

00:05:57.819 --> 00:06:01.819
And no doubt some who were previously serving

00:06:01.819 --> 00:06:04.819
as temporary special pioneers will be willing

00:06:04.819 --> 00:06:10.819
to continue in their assignment as regular pioneers.

00:06:10.819 --> 00:06:15.100
Please be assured that these adjustments

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:18.100
are not being made because of a lack

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:22.100
of financial support on your part.

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:26.100
Far from it, you have been very generous

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:29.100
in your support of the kingdom work.

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:32.100
And in your letters and cards,

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:35.100
you show a high level of spirituality

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:38.100
and great appreciation for all

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:44.100
that Jehovah is doing on behalf of his organization.

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:48.100
The response to JW.org to public witnessing,

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:51.100
to JW Broadcasting,

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:54.100
and the expanded use of videos

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:56.100
at the conventions this year,

00:06:56.100 --> 00:07:01.100
has been simply overwhelming.

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:05.100
However, it must be acknowledged

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:08.100
that the kingdom work is expanding

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:11.100
at an accelerated pace,

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:14.100
and we can only do so much

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:18.100
with the funds at our disposal.

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:21.100
Every family had realizes that

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:24.100
where the household income is limited,

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:28.100
he must carefully budget available funds

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:31.100
so that his wife and children

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:35.379
will have the necessities of life.

00:07:35.379 --> 00:07:38.379
Well, at Philippians chapter 1, verse 10,

00:07:38.379 --> 00:07:44.379
we're told to make sure of the more important things.

00:07:44.379 --> 00:07:50.379
In harmony with this wise advice,

00:07:50.379 --> 00:07:53.379
we desire to give priority to those activities

00:07:53.379 --> 00:07:57.379
that contribute the most to the spiritual welfare

00:07:57.379 --> 00:08:00.379
of God's people and the advancement

00:08:00.379 --> 00:08:03.379
of the global preaching work.

00:08:03.379 --> 00:08:05.379
Consider, for example,

00:08:05.379 --> 00:08:08.379
today's announcement that beginning in January,

00:08:08.379 --> 00:08:13.379
our public magazines will be published by monthly.

00:08:13.379 --> 00:08:17.379
There's no question that an abundance of spiritual food

00:08:17.379 --> 00:08:19.379
has been produced,

00:08:19.379 --> 00:08:22.379
so much in fact that many of our brothers

00:08:22.379 --> 00:08:25.379
have found it difficult to keep up.

00:08:26.379 --> 00:08:28.379
This adjustment will not only allow us

00:08:28.379 --> 00:08:31.379
to use available funds effectively,

00:08:31.379 --> 00:08:33.379
it will help our brothers to keep up

00:08:33.379 --> 00:08:38.019
with our spiritual provisions.

00:08:38.019 --> 00:08:42.019
We will be reducing personnel at Beth.

00:08:42.019 --> 00:08:44.019
Some Bethel family members

00:08:44.019 --> 00:08:47.019
will be invited to serve in the field.

00:08:47.019 --> 00:08:50.019
In addition to their regular work,

00:08:50.019 --> 00:08:52.019
Bethel family members will be caring

00:08:52.019 --> 00:08:55.019
for many of the services that were previously provided

00:08:55.019 --> 00:08:59.019
by fellow Bethelites.

00:08:59.019 --> 00:09:01.019
The response of the Bethel families

00:09:01.019 --> 00:09:06.019
to these adjustments has been heartwarming.

00:09:06.019 --> 00:09:08.019
We love them for it,

00:09:08.019 --> 00:09:11.019
and we love you too.

00:09:11.019 --> 00:09:14.019
Please make all of these adjustments

00:09:14.019 --> 00:09:17.019
a matter of prayer.

00:09:17.019 --> 00:09:20.019
Major Hovea continued to bless each one of you

00:09:20.019 --> 00:09:23.019
for the love you show for his name,

00:09:23.019 --> 00:09:27.019
with every good wish your brothers,

00:09:27.019 --> 00:09:29.019
governing body.

00:09:29.019 --> 00:09:38.639
The next talk by Garrett Lurch

00:09:38.639 --> 00:09:41.639
has a very generic title.

00:09:41.639 --> 00:09:45.639
It's talk on 2016 year text.

00:09:45.639 --> 00:09:48.639
I guess Garrett doesn't want to give anything away.

00:09:48.639 --> 00:09:53.389
We'll have to listen.

00:09:53.389 --> 00:09:56.389
John 316 says,

00:09:56.389 --> 00:09:59.389
God loved the world so much

00:09:59.389 --> 00:10:01.389
that He gave His only begotten son

00:10:01.389 --> 00:10:04.389
so that everyone exercising faith in him

00:10:04.389 --> 00:10:06.389
might not be destroyed,

00:10:06.389 --> 00:10:09.389
but have everlasting life.

00:10:09.389 --> 00:10:12.389
The world that God loved

00:10:12.389 --> 00:10:17.389
included atheists and enemies of God.

00:10:17.389 --> 00:10:19.389
In line with this,

00:10:19.389 --> 00:10:22.389
Jesus said in Matthew 544-45,

00:10:22.389 --> 00:10:26.389
continue to love your enemies

00:10:26.389 --> 00:10:29.389
and to pray for those who persecute you

00:10:29.389 --> 00:10:32.389
so that you may prove yourselves

00:10:32.389 --> 00:10:36.389
sons of your father who is in the heavens.

00:10:36.389 --> 00:10:40.389
But how are we to love our enemies?

00:10:40.389 --> 00:10:43.389
We don't need to have a faction for them,

00:10:43.389 --> 00:10:47.389
but we need to show principled love,

00:10:47.389 --> 00:10:50.389
agape in Greek,

00:10:50.389 --> 00:10:53.389
Romans 12.20 says,

00:10:53.389 --> 00:10:55.389
if your enemy is hungry,

00:10:55.389 --> 00:10:57.389
feed him,

00:10:57.389 --> 00:11:00.389
give him something to drink.

00:11:00.389 --> 00:11:03.389
If we are to love our enemies,

00:11:03.389 --> 00:11:08.389
are we not to love even much more our brothers?

00:11:08.389 --> 00:11:14.389
Aside from love for relatives in Greek,

00:11:14.389 --> 00:11:16.389
Christians need to display

00:11:16.389 --> 00:11:21.389
four types of love toward the brothers.

00:11:21.389 --> 00:11:25.389
The first type of love is based on principles.

00:11:25.389 --> 00:11:28.389
Greek agape,

00:11:28.389 --> 00:11:32.960
and the verb to it is agapau.

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:35.960
The noun agape appears more frequently

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:37.960
than the other terms.

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:41.960
Agape carries the meaning of love guided by principles,

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:47.529
true or false.

00:11:47.529 --> 00:11:51.529
Agape does not include affection.

00:11:51.529 --> 00:11:53.529
Actually, the answer is,

00:11:53.529 --> 00:11:56.529
have true and have false.

00:11:56.529 --> 00:12:01.529
Agape may or may not include affection and fondness,

00:12:01.529 --> 00:12:05.529
depending on the circumstances.

00:12:05.529 --> 00:12:10.529
A second type of love is expressed by a verb in Greek,

00:12:10.529 --> 00:12:13.529
and that is filio.

00:12:13.529 --> 00:12:16.529
It refers to having affection,

00:12:16.529 --> 00:12:21.529
being fond of a friend or an object.

00:12:21.529 --> 00:12:25.029
The related noun is filia,

00:12:25.029 --> 00:12:29.029
but this word occurs only once in the Greek scriptures,

00:12:29.029 --> 00:12:34.029
saying that one should not have filia or love for the world.

00:12:34.029 --> 00:12:38.029
James 4 verse 4.

00:12:38.029 --> 00:12:42.029
Let us now consider some examples of affection.

00:12:42.029 --> 00:12:46.029
Jesus felt affection for his friend Lazarus,

00:12:46.029 --> 00:12:49.029
so he gave way to tears

00:12:49.029 --> 00:12:52.029
when standing in front of Lazarus' tomb.

00:12:53.029 --> 00:12:57.029
John 11, 35, 36.

00:12:57.029 --> 00:12:59.029
In Proverbs 831,

00:12:59.029 --> 00:13:01.029
Jesus in his pre-human existence

00:13:01.029 --> 00:13:07.029
said he was especially fond of mankind.

00:13:07.029 --> 00:13:09.029
This relationship existed also

00:13:09.029 --> 00:13:13.029
and still exists between Jehovah and Jesus.

00:13:13.029 --> 00:13:15.029
At John 335,

00:13:15.029 --> 00:13:19.029
we learned that Jehovah feels love agape for his son,

00:13:19.029 --> 00:13:24.029
but his feelings are not limited to that type of love.

00:13:24.029 --> 00:13:31.029
In John 520, Jesus said the Father has affection for the son.

00:13:31.029 --> 00:13:35.029
Certainly, God's agape love for Jesus Christ

00:13:35.029 --> 00:13:38.029
is coupled with much affection.

00:13:38.029 --> 00:13:44.340
Our love for our brother should likewise also extend

00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:47.340
beyond mere agape love.

00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:52.980
We should develop affection for each.

00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:55.980
Twice, Jesus asked Peter if he loved him,

00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:58.980
using the verb agapeau.

00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:01.980
Both times Peter earnestly affirmed

00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:07.980
that he had affection for Jesus using the more intimate word filio,

00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:13.980
according to John 21 verses 15 through 17.

00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:18.980
How could Peter show his affection for Jesus?

00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:22.980
Well, something more than a mere inner feeling was needed.

00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:26.980
Peter could prove his affection by shepherding the sheep.

00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:35.259
Jesus said, initiative is action is proof of affection.

00:14:35.259 --> 00:14:38.259
It's true in John 13, 35, Jesus said,

00:14:38.259 --> 00:14:41.259
by this all will know that you are my disciples

00:14:41.259 --> 00:14:44.259
if you have love among yourselves.

00:14:44.259 --> 00:14:47.259
And here he used the word agape.

00:14:47.259 --> 00:14:51.259
But it is not enough to have agape for our brothers.

00:14:51.259 --> 00:14:53.259
Why?

00:14:53.259 --> 00:14:58.259
Well, it is not so difficult to show agape love for all brothers,

00:14:58.259 --> 00:15:02.259
but it is difficult to have affection for all brothers.

00:15:02.259 --> 00:15:08.259
It might be challenging to show affection.

00:15:08.259 --> 00:15:13.259
One reason is because some have personality traits

00:15:13.259 --> 00:15:16.259
that we find difficult to tolerate.

00:15:16.259 --> 00:15:20.259
Perhaps one has the habit of engaging in negative gossip

00:15:20.259 --> 00:15:23.259
or complaints about many things.

00:15:23.259 --> 00:15:28.259
As imperfect humans, all of us need to work on developing

00:15:28.259 --> 00:15:35.259
not only agape love, but also affection for all of our brothers.

00:15:35.259 --> 00:15:40.259
But even affection is not quite enough.

00:15:40.259 --> 00:15:45.259
With that in mind, what other form of love do we need to display?

00:15:45.259 --> 00:15:50.259
We need to feel tender affection.

00:15:50.259 --> 00:15:54.259
In Romans chapter 12 verse 10,

00:15:54.259 --> 00:16:00.259
the word philostargos is used, and it means more than affection.

00:16:00.259 --> 00:16:03.259
In Greek, it means tender affection.

00:16:03.259 --> 00:16:09.259
According to the inside book, volume 1 page 55.

00:16:09.259 --> 00:16:12.259
And the Apostle Paul encouraged Christians

00:16:12.259 --> 00:16:17.259
to cultivate this quality, tender affection.

00:16:17.259 --> 00:16:21.259
The fourth important type of love that we need to have as Christians

00:16:21.259 --> 00:16:27.259
is Philadelphia or brotherly affection.

00:16:27.259 --> 00:16:33.259
In Hebrews chapter 13 verse 1, this is mentioned.

00:16:33.259 --> 00:16:35.259
It says there,

00:16:35.259 --> 00:16:39.259
let your brotherly love continue.

00:16:39.259 --> 00:16:45.519
Jehovah commands according to 1 Peter 3, 8.

00:16:45.519 --> 00:16:48.519
Finally, all of you have unity of mind, fellow feeling,

00:16:48.519 --> 00:16:55.519
brotherly affection, tender compassion and humility.

00:16:55.519 --> 00:16:59.519
And this refers to a strong attachment.

00:16:59.519 --> 00:17:04.519
Brotherly affection existed between David and Jonathan.

00:17:04.519 --> 00:17:07.519
It existed between Ruth and Naomi.

00:17:07.519 --> 00:17:11.519
In the first century, it existed among true Christians.

00:17:11.519 --> 00:17:14.519
Christians in Jerusalem and in the Roman province Judea

00:17:14.519 --> 00:17:16.519
faced very difficult times.

00:17:16.519 --> 00:17:22.519
Jesus warned them that the Roman armies would insert the city and attack it.

00:17:22.519 --> 00:17:27.519
This happened in the year 66 of our common era.

00:17:27.519 --> 00:17:34.519
Christians needed to be alert as to an opportunity to flee the city and the province.

00:17:34.519 --> 00:17:37.519
This opportunity came when, for unknown reasons,

00:17:37.519 --> 00:17:44.519
the Roman army general Sestius Gallus withdrew the attack.

00:17:44.519 --> 00:17:50.799
Fleeing meant that those Christians had to leave behind their houses,

00:17:50.799 --> 00:17:54.799
their businesses, and all their possessions.

00:17:54.799 --> 00:18:01.799
Those who promptly obeyed and fled to the other side of the Jordan were saved.

00:18:01.799 --> 00:18:05.799
Fleeing in such a hurry and leaving possessions behind,

00:18:05.799 --> 00:18:08.799
there was an need for Christians to share with one another,

00:18:08.799 --> 00:18:12.799
what little they had been able to take along on the trip.

00:18:12.799 --> 00:18:21.799
Those who would travel in small groups would certainly share whatever food or water they had on hand.

00:18:21.799 --> 00:18:31.180
In Matthew 24, 21, Jesus described those days as a time of great tribulation.

00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:37.180
This period of the great tribulation against Jerusalem lasted a few years

00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:47.180
from 66 of our common era to the year 70 when Jerusalem was destroyed by another Roman army.

00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:52.180
The great tribulation in the first century foreshadowed the great tribulation

00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:56.180
that is to come on the entire system of things in our day,

00:18:56.180 --> 00:19:07.180
culminating with the divine war that the Bible refers to as Armageddon in Revelation 16, verse 16.

00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:12.180
We do not know how long the great tribulation will last in our time,

00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:17.180
but there will be, according to the Watchtower 99,

00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:26.180
May 1, page 12, and, quote, initial face and a final face,

00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:31.180
but also an interval between these.

00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:34.180
The great tribulation will start with the destruction of all's religion

00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:43.180
when the angels will unleash the four winds of destruction as prophesied in Revelation 7, verses 1 and 2.

00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:51.180
Jesus said, in the first century, flesh, referring to His disciples, would be saved.

00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:54.180
Matthew 24 verse 22.

00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:59.180
In our time, God's people will also be saved.

00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:01.180
They will be saved twice.

00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:08.180
First, when political elements will destroy all false religious institutions,

00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:14.180
but God's people will also survive and will be saved the second time

00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:20.180
at the culmination of the great tribulation sometime later.

00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:26.180
Revelation 7, 14 says that they will come out of the great tribulation,

00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:29.180
pointing to their survival.

00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:32.180
Before and during the great tribulation,

00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:40.740
brotherly affection, Philadelphia, will help us to survive.

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:47.740
Added to this, I think of the serious economic situation, many find themselves in already today.

00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:53.740
In some countries, our brothers only can afford to have just one meal a day.

00:20:53.740 --> 00:21:02.250
Today, as Jesus told, the love of most people in the world has cooled off,

00:21:02.250 --> 00:21:10.250
whereas our love for one another keeps growing, it becomes more and more intense.

00:21:10.250 --> 00:21:16.140
We apply the counsel in Hebrews 131,

00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:21.140
let your brotherly love, or Philadelphia, continue.

00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:29.140
Even if we display that love now, we need to continue displaying it.

00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:36.480
In what specific ways can we let our brotherly love continue?

00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:45.480
We can look at the context if you go back to Hebrews 13 and verse 2,

00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:50.480
it says, do not forget hospitality.

00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:53.480
Well, what does it mean?

00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:57.480
Do not invite just close friends.

00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:02.480
Keep in mind that there is no need for an elaborate meal,

00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:09.819
coffee and cake would do it also, and it could be good coffee and good cake.

00:22:09.819 --> 00:22:20.250
But showing hospitality to others is not just in order to have fun.

00:22:20.250 --> 00:22:26.250
It is about getting to know each other, having spiritual conversations

00:22:26.250 --> 00:22:31.250
and growing in love for one another.

00:22:31.250 --> 00:22:37.250
We commend warmly also the many sisters that show brotherly love.

00:22:37.250 --> 00:22:43.250
Well, in that case, we could say sisterly love through hospitality.

00:22:43.250 --> 00:22:46.250
Thank you very much.

00:22:46.250 --> 00:22:51.250
Now, in the next verse, verse 3, Paul says,

00:22:51.250 --> 00:22:58.250
among other things, keep in mind those in prison.

00:22:58.250 --> 00:23:02.250
We can do so by fervent prayers in their behalf.

00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:07.250
We can pray for our brothers in South Korea, for example, or in Eritrea,

00:23:07.250 --> 00:23:11.250
where some are imprisoned already for 20 years,

00:23:11.250 --> 00:23:17.250
and we can pray for those who live in dictatorial countries.

00:23:17.250 --> 00:23:25.250
In verse 4, Paul goes on to say, let marriage be honorable among all.

00:23:25.250 --> 00:23:28.250
Well, what does that mean?

00:23:28.250 --> 00:23:33.250
Well, we do not want to go beyond the proper limits of chased behavior

00:23:33.250 --> 00:23:37.250
when dealing with those of the opposite sex, not our mate,

00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:43.720
not becoming overly familiar with them.

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:47.720
Here's another point about keeping marriage honorable.

00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:52.720
Would it show affection to ones made to secretly watch pornography?

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:56.720
Today, this harmful practice is engaged in not only by men,

00:23:56.720 --> 00:24:05.059
but now by millions of women, teenagers, adults, married, and single ones.

00:24:05.059 --> 00:24:10.059
In 2003 already, the plain dealer newspaper of Cleveland, Ohio,

00:24:10.059 --> 00:24:14.059
in the USA said, and I quote,

00:24:14.059 --> 00:24:20.059
in recent years, the accessibility, affordability, and anonymity of the Internet,

00:24:20.059 --> 00:24:27.059
have made pornography undeniably attractive to millions of women.

00:24:27.059 --> 00:24:33.059
Nearly one in three visitors to adult websites is a woman.

00:24:33.059 --> 00:24:43.539
142-year-old mother was found to spend up to 30 hours a week surfing the web for arousal.

00:24:43.539 --> 00:24:47.329
End of quote.

00:24:47.329 --> 00:24:52.329
Now if we go on and what Paul says in chapter 13,

00:24:52.329 --> 00:24:59.329
and verse 5, he says, among other things, be content with the present things.

00:24:59.329 --> 00:25:05.329
Our relationship with our brothers is worth more than any material processions.

00:25:05.329 --> 00:25:09.329
A Christian will therefore neither envy a fellow Christian,

00:25:09.329 --> 00:25:12.329
nor try to cheat him in a business matter.

00:25:12.329 --> 00:25:17.329
To the contrary, he will show a generous spirit toward those in need

00:25:17.329 --> 00:25:24.329
according to his own means as 1 Corinthians 162 encourages.

00:25:24.329 --> 00:25:30.329
An inverse 6, Paul goes on to say, be of good courage.

00:25:30.329 --> 00:25:34.329
Well, what does this have to do with brotherly love?

00:25:34.329 --> 00:25:40.329
Well, if we are of good courage, we will be better able to encourage those

00:25:40.329 --> 00:25:45.329
who are depressed and have to deal with problems.

00:25:45.329 --> 00:25:51.329
Verse 7, remember those who are taking the lead.

00:25:51.329 --> 00:25:56.329
We want to show Philadelphia towards elders and traveling overseers,

00:25:56.329 --> 00:26:02.329
or responsible brothers in Bethel or at the construction site.

00:26:02.329 --> 00:26:07.329
Let's consider what the first Thessalonians says,

00:26:07.329 --> 00:26:13.329
and verse chapter 5 verse 13.

00:26:13.329 --> 00:26:18.329
It says, we could start reading in verse 12.

00:26:18.329 --> 00:26:23.329
Now we request your brothers to show respect for those who are working hard among you

00:26:23.329 --> 00:26:27.329
and are presiding over you in the Lord and admonishing you

00:26:27.329 --> 00:26:31.329
and to give them extraordinary consideration in love

00:26:31.329 --> 00:26:33.329
because of their work.

00:26:33.329 --> 00:26:40.440
To give the elders consideration is not enough.

00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:47.440
To give them extraordinary consideration also is not enough.

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:50.440
Because what does the Scripture say?

00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:56.440
We are to give them extraordinary consideration in love.

00:26:56.440 --> 00:26:59.440
We need to get to the point of love our overseers

00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:03.440
and not just to obey them or to respect them.

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:10.440
The Greek word that is used here, according to the Kingdom Interlinear translation,

00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:17.779
has the rendering super abundantly.

00:27:17.779 --> 00:27:29.779
And certainly this is an area where we want to grow and show more love for our overseers.

00:27:29.779 --> 00:27:39.779
We show Philadelphia or brotherly love or affection also in times of persecution.

00:27:39.779 --> 00:27:46.779
Romans 12, 13 says, share with the holy ones according to their needs.

00:27:46.779 --> 00:27:52.779
And when there is a time of persecution there is more need to share with one another,

00:27:52.779 --> 00:27:55.779
share material things.

00:27:55.779 --> 00:28:00.779
He was not talking about sharing the good news because he said share with the holy ones

00:28:00.779 --> 00:28:07.779
that those who were already in the truth, brothers, share with the brothers, material things.

00:28:07.779 --> 00:28:15.779
An example is from modern times what happened in Nazi concentration camps.

00:28:15.779 --> 00:28:17.779
Brothers followed that principle.

00:28:17.779 --> 00:28:22.779
It was very touching to see brothers or those themselves marked for death

00:28:22.779 --> 00:28:31.779
to give some of their scan bread ratios to those having a harder time than they themselves had.

00:28:31.779 --> 00:28:40.779
Often it was just crumbs that they secretly hit under the pillow of those who for some reason or another

00:28:40.779 --> 00:28:48.779
had not been given enough or anything sometimes to eat and who had sometimes been forced

00:28:48.779 --> 00:28:55.779
to stand out in the courtyard in the fears cold with hardly anything on.

00:28:55.779 --> 00:29:00.779
They really showed brotherly affection.

00:29:00.779 --> 00:29:02.779
Another point.

00:29:02.779 --> 00:29:06.779
We show brotherly affection also in everyday life.

00:29:06.779 --> 00:29:09.779
We don't have to wait until we are imprisoned.

00:29:09.779 --> 00:29:19.059
We can share material things with those in need whether it's food, clothing or money.

00:29:19.059 --> 00:29:25.059
We also show brotherly love or affection in times of disasters.

00:29:25.059 --> 00:29:34.059
Many brothers are affected by tsunamis, hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, volcanic eruptions,

00:29:34.059 --> 00:29:41.430
or by opposition and governmental persecution or ban.

00:29:41.430 --> 00:29:47.430
In December 1999 there was a terrible landslide in Venezuela,

00:29:47.430 --> 00:29:50.430
caused by heavy rains.

00:29:50.430 --> 00:29:56.430
Many homes were swept down a mountain called El Avila.

00:29:56.430 --> 00:30:03.430
According to one estimate some 50,000 people may have died.

00:30:03.430 --> 00:30:08.430
And 400,000 were rendered homeless.

00:30:08.430 --> 00:30:18.059
For good reasons it was termed the worst natural disaster in Venezuela's history.

00:30:18.059 --> 00:30:20.059
Brothers lost their home.

00:30:20.059 --> 00:30:24.059
Did they have to stay overnight in the open?

00:30:24.059 --> 00:30:25.059
No.

00:30:25.059 --> 00:30:28.059
Our brothers gladly took them in.

00:30:28.059 --> 00:30:38.500
Even long after the disaster people had friends and relatives living with them until accommodations were built for them.

00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:44.500
Well and Elsa witnesses in Puerto Cabello live in a small apartment.

00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:51.500
A month after the disaster they still had 16 living there with them.

00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:55.500
16 brothers and sisters imagine that.

00:30:55.500 --> 00:31:02.500
Would we be willing to take in 16 impoverished brothers for several weeks,

00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:12.500
willing to take them into our homes, though perhaps not having sufficient bath and toilet facilities for so many?

00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:15.500
We trust you would do that. Why?

00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:26.500
Because brotherly love or affection is not just a feeling perhaps expressed by hugging.

00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:34.500
Brotherly love and affection is shown by initiative, by action.

00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:40.500
There's no doubt that Jehovah's people are known for their brotherly affection.

00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:48.500
In 1 Peter 122 we read love one another intensely from the heart.

00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:53.500
In 1 Thessalonians 4, 9 and 10 says,

00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:59.500
however, concerning brotherly love or brotherly affection,

00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:09.500
you do not need us to write to you, as the Apostle Paul, for you yourselves are taught by God to love one another.

00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:17.880
Also through this program Jehovah teaches us to love one another.

00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:29.880
It can be learned. But then Paul went on to urge all to go on doing so in fuller measure.

00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:34.880
Can we do so in fuller measure?

00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:40.880
Can we be more hospitable? Can we pray more for those in prison?

00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:48.880
We determine not to watch pornography because doing so would show lack of love for one's mate.

00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:56.880
Are we refraining from envying our brothers for things that they own or privileges that they enjoy?

00:32:56.880 --> 00:33:04.880
Are we able to strengthen and comfort our brothers more because we ourselves are of good courage?

00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:12.880
Can we develop more brotherly affection for the elders rather than just respecting and obeying them?

00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:23.890
Why is it so important to continue to show brotherly love for one another?

00:33:23.890 --> 00:33:30.890
First John 4, 20 and 21. We can read that from the Scriptures.

00:33:30.890 --> 00:33:36.890
It gives the answer. First John, chapter 4, 20 and 21.

00:33:36.890 --> 00:33:47.730
If anyone says, I love God and yet is hating his brother, he is a liar.

00:33:47.730 --> 00:33:52.730
For the one who lists the main point here, for the one who does not love his brother,

00:33:52.730 --> 00:33:58.730
whom he has seen cannot love God, whom he has not seen.

00:33:58.730 --> 00:34:11.730
And we have this commandment from him that whoever loves God must also love his brother.

00:34:11.730 --> 00:34:25.079
In spite of the many problems that we are facing now and perhaps in the future may face many more problems,

00:34:25.079 --> 00:34:43.079
each one of us can be confident of Jehovah's love for us, provided that we ourselves continue to love our brothers intensely from the heart and with tender brotherly affection.

00:34:43.079 --> 00:34:51.079
In line with this, for the 2016 year, the text or year text was chosen,

00:34:51.079 --> 00:35:10.050
let your brotherly love continue. Hebrews 13, 1.

00:35:10.050 --> 00:35:20.050
In addition to the 2016 year text, the governing body is pleased to share several announcements with you at this time.

00:35:20.050 --> 00:35:30.460
The first one, delighted to release a new 224-page publication entitled,

00:35:30.460 --> 00:35:53.079
What Can the Bible Teach Us? It's based on the current, what does the Bible really teach?

00:35:53.079 --> 00:36:05.079
Book, this new teach us, in the short form, teach us, book does not replace the Bible Teach Book.

00:36:05.079 --> 00:36:13.079
Rather, it will be useful when studying with individuals who need to have the truth presented in a simpler form.

00:36:13.079 --> 00:36:23.079
At the same time, teach us is not just a simplification of the text but has the following additional features.

00:36:23.079 --> 00:36:37.409
For one, at the end of every chapter is a two-page summary that replaces the review box of the Bible Teach Book.

00:36:37.409 --> 00:36:45.320
These summaries can also be used to conduct Bible studies.

00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:52.789
Another point, int notes, replace the appendix of the Bible Teach Book.

00:36:52.789 --> 00:37:00.789
The int notes correlate closely with the glossary of the revised New World translation.

00:37:00.789 --> 00:37:08.789
The int notes clarify some expressions that we as Jehovah's Witnesses use in our everyday conversation,

00:37:08.789 --> 00:37:17.619
but many may not be familiar with it, people of the public.

00:37:17.619 --> 00:37:24.619
The teacher's book will no doubt be a useful tool to help people gain a basic understanding of Bible truth,

00:37:24.619 --> 00:37:27.619
similar to the way the Bible Teach Book is used.

00:37:27.619 --> 00:37:36.619
The goal is to help individuals to dedicate their life to Jehovah based on an accurate knowledge of Jehovah's will.

00:37:36.619 --> 00:37:51.409
What can the Bible Teach us will be available on JW.org Watchtower Online Library and JW Library later this afternoon.

00:37:51.409 --> 00:38:18.000
A limited supply of printed copies will be available at various distribution points or locations following the conclusion of the program.

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:29.170
Second announcement. The book organized to do Jehovah's will was released in 2005.

00:38:29.170 --> 00:38:44.170
The purpose of this book is to make clear what is involved in pleasing God and to provide an overview of how the Christian congregation is organized for getting God's work done.

00:38:44.170 --> 00:39:00.170
Over the past 10 years, there have been a number of significant refinements in the way that the work is organized as well as adjustments in terminology and in the way our meetings are conducted.

00:39:00.170 --> 00:39:35.750
Therefore, it is our pleasure to announce the release of the revised edition of organized to do Jehovah's will.

00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:48.750
Well, later this afternoon, the revised edition of the organized book will be available on JW.org and the latest version of JW Library.

00:39:48.750 --> 00:40:00.000
A limited supply of printed copies will be also available at the rear of the auditorium following the concluding prayer.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:41:08.119
This was one pocket, second pocket. Well, what do you think? There's a third announcement. Well, for the next announcement, please watch the following video.

00:41:08.119 --> 00:41:11.119
Revised edition of the New World Translation.

00:41:11.119 --> 00:41:30.860
Most of us can remember that exciting moment in 2013, but it didn't stop there.

00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:44.860
In addition to receiving our regular edition of the new Bible, it was also announced that there would be released a large size edition, a pocket size edition, and a study edition of the revised New World Translation.

00:41:44.860 --> 00:41:51.860
We're now in 2015, and we may be wondering, where is the study edition?

00:41:51.860 --> 00:42:04.860
We are happy to announce that the first book of this new edition, the Gospel of Matthew, is now completed and will be released later today, October 3, 2015.

00:42:04.860 --> 00:42:13.440
This online edition will be released on our website one book at a time.

00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:17.440
The other Bible books will be released over the coming years.

00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:28.440
Designed with a user-friendly interface similar to RJW Library App, this edition includes unique features to help you enjoy a deeper study of God's Word.

00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:39.440
A key feature of this new edition is the study notes. These notes provide cultural, geographic, and linguistic insight into many Bible verses.

00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:44.440
Also listed are parallel events associated with key verses.

00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:52.440
Additionally, each Bible book will have a multimedia section containing images and a video that introduces the book.

00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:55.440
Would you like to see this introductory video?

00:42:55.440 --> 00:43:03.250
An introduction to the book of Matthew.

00:43:03.250 --> 00:43:10.250
Matthew was working as a tax collector and cavernium when he was invited by Jesus to become a disciple.

00:43:10.250 --> 00:43:17.250
Later, after the Passover of 31 CE, he was also chosen as one of the twelve apostles.

00:43:17.250 --> 00:43:22.250
Matthew personally witnessed most of Jesus' three-and-a-half-year ministry.

00:43:22.250 --> 00:43:29.250
And around the year of 41 CE, he was the first to write an account of Jesus' life and teachings.

00:43:29.250 --> 00:43:37.250
His account would eventually become one of the four Bible books, along with Mark, Luke, and John, known as the Gospels.

00:43:38.250 --> 00:43:44.250
The book of Matthew focuses on the time period between 2 BCE and 33 CE.

00:43:44.250 --> 00:43:52.250
It includes events just before Jesus' birth and ends with Jesus' command to go make disciples.

00:43:52.250 --> 00:44:01.250
Did you know? Although Matthew is the first book of the Christian Greek scriptures, there is evidence that it was originally written in Hebrew.

00:44:01.250 --> 00:44:06.250
Some time later, Matthew himself may have translated his gospel into Greek.

00:44:06.250 --> 00:44:10.250
The book has been divided into 28 chapters.

00:44:10.250 --> 00:44:19.250
In the first 18 chapters, much of the content is arranged by subject, focusing on the teachings found in Jesus' public discourses.

00:44:19.250 --> 00:44:29.250
Starting in chapter 19, however, Matthew turns his attention to the last days of Jesus' ministry and generally relates the events in the order that they happened.

00:44:29.250 --> 00:44:37.250
About 40% of Matthew's gospel is unique, describing events and details not found in the other three gospels.

00:44:37.250 --> 00:44:48.250
It begins with Abraham, and lists the family line of Jesus through his adoptive father Joseph, proving that Jesus is the legal heir of King David.

00:44:48.250 --> 00:45:00.250
It provides a thorough account of Jesus' sermon on the mount, and it also includes many of Jesus' illustrations, such as the wheat and the weeds, the pearl of high value, and the dragnet.

00:45:00.250 --> 00:45:07.250
Matthew's account greatly emphasizes that the theme of Jesus' teaching was the kingdom of the heavens.

00:45:07.250 --> 00:45:17.250
To help readers identify Jesus as the promised Messiah, this book includes numerous direct quotes and references from many books in the Hebrew scriptures.

00:45:17.250 --> 00:45:24.250
No wonder Matthew has been described as a bridge between the Hebrew and Christian Greek scriptures.

00:45:24.250 --> 00:45:38.250
As you enjoy your study of Matthew, note how the gospel establishes Jesus' legal right to David's throne, emphasize his Christ teachings, and highlights God's kingdom.

00:45:38.250 --> 00:45:45.980
This is just a sampling of the thrilling new features contained in this publication.

00:45:45.980 --> 00:45:57.579
It is our hope that this new study edition of the Bible will draw you even closer to our Heavenly Father, Jehovah God.

00:45:57.579 --> 00:46:36.280
This study edition of the Book of Matthew will be available later today on JW.org, go to the publications tab and select Bible.

00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:44.280
At a later time, it will also be available on the JW Library application.
