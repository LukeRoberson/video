00:00:01.419 --> 00:00:04.219
My name is Mitchell Burdwell.

00:00:04.219 --> 00:00:06.900
I personally thought I had it all together.

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:12.060
I had a perfect little family, a son and a daughter, and a wife, regor, pine, nearing,

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:13.740
sereness, and elder.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.780
I was working as a custom home builder, and I had just finished building my dream house.

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:22.379
Everything I ever wanted I had.

00:00:22.379 --> 00:00:28.739
I was assigned to go to a construction project in Japan as an international volunteer.

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:30.899
That project changed everything.

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:38.740
When I got over there, I realized everybody on the site was a regor pine ear.

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:43.500
It really began to have an impact on me.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.259
I tried to justify it personally, but I said, you know, I'm doing okay.

00:00:47.259 --> 00:00:48.899
I'm doing what I should be doing.

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.100
They're just overachievers.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.380
One day, my interpreter approached me, and I said, well, let's interview the committee

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:58.380
today.

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:02.020
I only had one question that was burned into my heart.

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.140
How could they be balanced and be regor pine ears?

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.900
He asked the question.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.620
They asked me to turn to Matthew 633.

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.819
He said, I go to read it.

00:01:11.819 --> 00:01:13.620
He says, no, read it out loud.

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.099
So I read it out loud because I read it again.

00:01:16.099 --> 00:01:17.620
So I read it for the second time.

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.900
And he says, the scriptures are clear.

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:29.019
If you truly seek first the kingdom, these other things will be added.

00:01:29.019 --> 00:01:31.219
That had a major impact on me.

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:34.620
I was just standing there with my Bible and my thoughts.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.939
I felt so little.

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:39.379
That night, I couldn't sleep.

00:01:39.379 --> 00:01:43.019
I kept playing that over and over in my head.

00:01:43.019 --> 00:01:45.540
Why don't I believe?

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.060
I remember as a kid, we used to play the game where you lean back and people catch you.

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.540
I never liked that game.

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.500
But that served in Jehovah.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.420
You get a lean back.

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.700
You know he will catch you.

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.180
You don't know how though.

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.939
And you don't know when.

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:10.259
Well, the next day, the chairman shows up to speak to me privately.

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.780
He says, may I analyze a day in your life?

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.580
And he describes my life in detail, accurately.

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:25.219
He says, you start off the phone's ring and all day long you're busy with elders, activity,

00:02:25.219 --> 00:02:27.219
RBC and your business.

00:02:27.219 --> 00:02:31.580
Is it you come home from work, your children are trying to communicate with you, but you're

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:32.580
so busy.

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.340
Because maybe it's late at night, about 10 o'clock at night, you're down this time to spend

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.580
some time with your wife, but you fall asleep.

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.060
And then he just stopped and asked me a question.

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:55.900
He says, why do you only spend tired time with your wife and your children?

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:01.780
So from that moment, then I started thinking, what can I do personally to make some adjustments?

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.580
We had to find a way to get involved in full time service as a family.

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:12.219
I do feel that we have a lot of our brothers and sisters in the organization, maybe who

00:03:12.219 --> 00:03:16.780
can't pioneer, but they give them to your home and everything they have.

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.259
And that's all you ask.

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:21.219
Give me your best.

00:03:21.219 --> 00:03:24.580
Immediately when we got back, we started making adjustments.

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.819
It wasn't easy.

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:31.539
We gave up a lot of things that we thought were important to us.

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:37.020
My daughter pioneered and opened up a lot of doors for us as a family.

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:43.860
My daughter and her husband are construction servants with the LDC department.

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:51.620
My son and his wife, he's a regular pioneer, also serving as a remote Bethelite.

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.939
Currently we're serving as construction servants with the LDC department.

00:03:55.939 --> 00:03:59.699
We get to serve Jehovah and this assignment as a couple.

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:05.180
We paint ourselves sometimes thinking, what a life we get to live.

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.300
Even our children to this day, we still discuss this.

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:15.180
They said for them, there's the best decision we ever made as a family, given up the stuff

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.139
that served Jehovah full time.

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:24.540
And I look back, it was that decision, that scripture, at that moment, that defining moment

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:25.660
that started it all.
