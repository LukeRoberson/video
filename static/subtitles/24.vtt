00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:11.560
Welcome to another edition of JW Broadcasting. Thank you for joining us. You will

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:17.480
be delighted to see reports of some of the many exciting activities that have

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:24.079
taken place this past calendar year in furthering Kingdom Interest. You will

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:31.320
also hear experiences from construction projects in Micronesia that the

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:38.439
brothers involved attribute to Jehovah's Intervention. And have you benefited

00:00:38.439 --> 00:00:45.320
from the translation of JW Broadcasting into languages other than English? We

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:52.359
will take you behind the scenes to see how the program is made available to as

00:00:52.359 --> 00:01:02.679
many of God's sheep as possible. This is the January program of JW Broadcasting.

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:26.290
Our theme for this month's broadcast is sincere

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:34.489
commendation is always appropriate. One definition of commendation is the

00:01:34.489 --> 00:01:41.170
act of praising or approving of someone. And when it is given in a sincere,

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:49.049
genuine way, how encouraging it can be to the one receiving it. That makes us

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:57.730
think of Proverbs 15 23, which says, a word spoken at the right time, how good it

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:06.609
is. Similarly, Proverbs 12 25 talks about how anxiety can weigh a person's heart

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:15.610
down, but then says, but a good word cheers it up. A 19th century author

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:24.090
gested, I can live for two months on a good compliment. But now, keeping our

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:30.889
theme in mind, let us talk about Jehovah and Jesus. Can you imagine how much

00:02:30.889 --> 00:02:36.889
Jehovah must have appreciated his only begotten son whom we have come to know

00:02:36.889 --> 00:02:46.050
is Jesus? Jesus had faithfully supported his father for eons of time. But then

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:51.289
when he learned of Jehovah's purpose to buy back the hope of everlasting life

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:59.289
for imperfect humans, what did Jesus do? Did he make excuses? As to why he could

00:02:59.289 --> 00:03:07.090
not leave heaven and come to the earth? Father, I have many projects going on and I

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:13.969
have my friends here in heaven. And besides, I would miss being with you. I just

00:03:13.969 --> 00:03:19.129
don't have the right circumstances. Furthermore, this will be a very difficult

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:29.050
painful humiliating assignment. It seems like this is a good assignment for Gabriel.

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:37.849
No, Jesus did not even slightly reason this way. He willingly made sacrifices that

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:46.569
cost him dearly. He changed life forms, going from a majestic spirit creature to a

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:55.330
little baby completely dependent on his parents. Later, as a perfect child, he

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:03.169
remained fully in subjection to imperfect parents. Then, as an adult, he worked

00:04:03.169 --> 00:04:10.889
his heart out in starting a preaching campaign that continues to this very day.

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:16.250
You wonder how many pairs of sandals he may have worn out during his three and a

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:25.250
half year ministry. Then, he died an agonizing death on a torture stake in order to

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:33.370
provide a corresponding ransom according to Jehovah's purpose. He contributed his

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:41.209
very life to support the work that Jehovah wanted accomplished at that time.

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:48.889
Undoubtedly, you recall the video that was shown during the final talk of last year's

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:57.129
regional convention. It helped us better appreciate what Jesus did for us. By his

00:04:57.129 --> 00:05:04.810
selfless act, he opened the way for everlasting life, whether in heaven or on earth.

00:05:05.769 --> 00:05:13.529
But now the question is, did Jehovah appreciate all that his son did to support him,

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:22.250
sanctifying his name, and vindicating his sovereignty? Absolutely. We know he did.

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:33.370
Imagine Jesus waste deep in the Jordan River. His hair still dripping from his baptism. He looks

00:05:34.329 --> 00:05:43.209
up and in some way sees the heavens open up and God's spirit descend like a dove and come upon

00:05:43.209 --> 00:05:53.850
him. Then he hears Jehovah's own voice from heaven say, this is my son, the beloved whom I have

00:05:54.329 --> 00:06:03.529
approved. If we think about it, Jehovah packed a lot of commendation into that one sentence.

00:06:04.649 --> 00:06:12.089
This is my son. Jehovah, in effect, was saying, son, I am proud to be your father.

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:23.209
The beloved Jehovah was saying, I love you son, whom I have approved. Jehovah was saying,

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:31.930
I am very happy son with what you have done thus far. And I know I'm going to be very happy

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:40.410
with what you will yet do. Can you imagine how good all of that commendation made Jesus feel?

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:50.089
Yes, Jehovah appreciated all of the sacrifices Jesus had made to support what he wanted accomplished

00:06:50.730 --> 00:07:01.180
and he expressed his appreciation. Jesus, being the exact reflection of his father,

00:07:02.139 --> 00:07:10.939
was also a perfect example of one who commended others. As recorded at Luke 22, 28, and 29,

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:18.300
do you remember what Jesus said to his faithful 11 apostles on the last night of his life as a human?

00:07:18.379 --> 00:07:29.899
You are the ones who have stuck with me in my trials. And I make a covenant with you for a kingdom.

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:41.500
Warm commendation indeed. Consider another example. Although Jesus provided constructive

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:50.060
counsel to several congregations, he also warmly commended them. Notice what he said to the

00:07:50.060 --> 00:08:03.740
congregation in Thyatira at Revelation 2 verse 19. In verse 19, Jesus said, I know your deeds

00:08:04.699 --> 00:08:13.420
and your love and faith and ministry and endurance and that your deeds of late are more than those

00:08:14.139 --> 00:08:24.220
you did at first. Such detailed, thoughtful commendation likely move the congregation to continue

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:33.320
making similar progress thereafter. Well now we have talked about the two best examples in the

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:44.519
universe of ones who are generous with commendation, Jehovah and Jesus. But now what about us?

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:55.879
Ephesians 5, 1 urges us to become imitators of God. And our convention theme this past year

00:08:55.960 --> 00:09:06.279
was imitate Jesus. And this counsel also applies to the governing body. The governing body would like

00:09:06.279 --> 00:09:16.360
to follow Jehovah's and Jesus good example by providing warm commendation to you, dear brothers and

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:24.600
sisters. So many of you are so responsive to any suggestions or appeals made to you

00:09:25.559 --> 00:09:35.960
by the faithful and discreet slave. In the late 2015 monthly program, we shared our interest in

00:09:36.679 --> 00:09:45.080
expediting the construction of new kingdom halls and remote translation offices. And we explained

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:53.960
some of the financial challenges we were facing in being able to do so. We discerned that contributions

00:09:53.960 --> 00:10:04.919
immediately went up by more than 15% for the months of June and July. We thank you very much.

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:13.320
Not only are older ones in Jehovah's organization responding with generosity,

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:20.039
the governing body has been deeply touched by the response of many young ones.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:28.919
It's just one example. I personally received a precious letter, Dear Brother Lat.

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:39.799
Hello, I am 13 years old. The reason I wrote this letter is because of the May JW Broadcasting.

00:10:40.759 --> 00:10:48.200
I was motivated to contribute to the worldwide work. I have been saving up

00:10:49.159 --> 00:10:57.240
and my relatives gave me some money. I hope it helps. I also want to thank you and the other

00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:07.559
governing body members for the Korean JW Broadcasting. Now, my whole family can understand much more

00:11:07.559 --> 00:11:15.559
and benefit from it. My whole family wants to appreciate all of this. Please tell the other

00:11:15.559 --> 00:11:24.360
governing body members also. And then she drew a smiley face. So because you motivated me in

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:33.960
financial ways, I was also motivated in spiritual ways. I am doing auxiliary pioneering during summer

00:11:34.039 --> 00:11:44.600
break. One more time. My family and I want to say thank you. And then she drew a big red heart

00:11:45.159 --> 00:11:51.559
at the end of her letter. Well, I sent the check to the Treasurer's office, but I'm definitely

00:11:51.559 --> 00:12:03.179
keeping her touching letter and her adorable picture. Comments such as these have moved us to

00:12:03.179 --> 00:12:12.059
want to use this January 2016 broadcast program to thank you from the bottom of our hearts

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:22.220
for your support and also to update you on what has happened since last May. So many good things

00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:33.860
are happening. So we ask what has been accomplished in the past eight months? Well, we continue to finance

00:12:34.899 --> 00:12:41.700
the weekly costs to feed and house the more than 25,000 Bethel family members worldwide

00:12:42.659 --> 00:12:50.179
and to help support over 55,000 others in special full-time service. We have been able to continue

00:12:50.179 --> 00:12:58.820
to fund the huge construction project of building the World Headquarters Facility in Warwick,

00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:07.139
New York. Additionally, large branch construction and renovation projects that were underway

00:13:08.419 --> 00:13:15.779
are being supported. And around the world, considerable audio and video equipment has been

00:13:15.779 --> 00:13:25.860
purchased to show the entire program of our imitate Jesus Convention on big screens or monitors.

00:13:26.659 --> 00:13:35.539
Seeing the participants up close holds our attention and enhances the learning experience.

00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:45.860
You may not realize it, but there were 52 videos and almost 30 other audio and visual aids presented

00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:53.860
during this convention, making a total of some 80 presentations for our enjoyment.

00:13:54.580 --> 00:14:03.379
In addition to all of the foregoing, in the past eight months, over 2,000 kingdom halls have been built

00:14:04.259 --> 00:14:12.980
or are in the process of being completed. That average is more than eight kingdom halls being built

00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:23.299
every day, which is truly amazing. Also, over 50 remote translation office facilities have been

00:14:23.299 --> 00:14:33.620
completed or are now in the process of being built. Does all of this mean, though, that we have

00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:41.779
accomplished all of our goals? You remember that in our May program, we mentioned the willing

00:14:41.779 --> 00:14:49.700
generosity of the Israelites in the wilderness when they were asked to contribute to the fabrication

00:14:49.779 --> 00:14:59.139
and construction of the tabernacle for true worship. You recall that in Exodus 35, it says that

00:14:59.139 --> 00:15:07.940
everyone whose heart impelled Him and everyone whose spirit incited Him came and brought their

00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:17.220
contribution for Jehovah. And in chapter 36 verse 7, it says, the goods were enough for all the work

00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:30.330
to be done and more than enough. So we ask, were the Israelites more appreciative and responsive

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:40.490
than we are today? No. As we said earlier, you are to be commended for your immediate generous

00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:48.090
response to the May broadcast. You responded similar to the Israelites in Moses time.

00:15:48.490 --> 00:15:59.210
The difference, however, between the Israelites giving an ours today is that they only had one project

00:15:59.210 --> 00:16:08.730
to construct. When it was completed, that was all it was needed. However, as you know, we have

00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:17.289
thousands of projects that need our continued support. It is not just a two month undertaking.

00:16:18.490 --> 00:16:25.850
In fact, as announced at the annual meeting this past October, the governing body is so serious

00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:33.129
about advancing kingdom interest in the field that we have re-analyzed ways. We can cut back

00:16:34.090 --> 00:16:44.809
at all the branches so as to redirect more funds to the field. For example, many long standing

00:16:44.809 --> 00:16:55.049
Bethel routines and services are being reduced or eliminated. This will result in fewer members

00:16:55.049 --> 00:17:05.049
of the Bethel family being required. The governing body is absolutely confident, completely confident

00:17:05.769 --> 00:17:14.170
that this initiative and other cost-saving initiatives that we're taking coupled with your

00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:23.289
continued support will enable us to care for all the needs in the field. On behalf of the governing

00:17:23.289 --> 00:17:33.849
body, I would like to borrow the inspired words of 2 Thessalonians, chapter 1, verses 3 and 4.

00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:39.930
We express the words of Paul to you, dear brothers and sisters.

00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:53.049
We are obligated always to give thanks to God for you, brothers. This is fitting because your

00:17:53.049 --> 00:17:59.769
faith is growing exceedingly and the love of each and every one of you is increasing toward one

00:17:59.769 --> 00:18:09.529
another. As a result, we ourselves take pride in you among the congregations of God because of

00:18:09.529 --> 00:18:23.509
your endurance and faith. Again, we sincerely thank you for your generous support of Jehovah's

00:18:23.509 --> 00:18:33.829
Great Work in these exciting last days. But now, during this broadcast, we would like to show you

00:18:33.829 --> 00:18:46.220
some of the things being accomplished as a result of your generosity. This past summer, it was my

00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:55.180
privilege to attend a large regional convention in Stockholm, Sweden. Brothers and sisters from Sweden,

00:18:55.180 --> 00:19:01.740
Denmark, Norway, Iceland, Greenland, the Faroe Islands, and also the Swedish Circuit in Finland

00:19:02.859 --> 00:19:10.460
were present at this historic convention. While this event was a great spiritual boost for the

00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:18.619
witnesses, some of you may know that the majority of the local residents do not believe in God.

00:19:19.579 --> 00:19:30.059
Many consider themselves atheists, but the conduct and professionalism of Jehovah's people made our

00:19:30.059 --> 00:19:51.609
great impact. First, the branch offices were merged. And the result was a new branch office, Scandinavia

00:19:51.609 --> 00:20:00.250
branch. We thought that if all the brothers in Scandinavia should benefit from this unity, then we

00:20:00.250 --> 00:20:09.960
had to have a convention in Stockholm. Here, we were allowed to arrange a regional convention,

00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:17.640
but one of enormous size. Having 50,000 brothers gathered together for three days is the largest

00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:25.640
bureaucratic event ever in Scandinavia. So, we began to look for a facility and we found friends

00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:40.490
Arena. I think we have had a very good collaboration. Many times, I have thought, wow,

00:20:40.569 --> 00:20:45.529
these people working for you as the organizers of infrastructure, logistics, and so on,

00:20:45.529 --> 00:20:54.519
we should work with them more often. The use of technology has been the greatest challenge.

00:20:54.519 --> 00:20:58.440
Obviously, with such a last project, many details have to come together.

00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:04.200
There are four languages and three sign languages, and all this have to be tied together and

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:11.240
work at the same time. It has been a challenge, but we made it work. All the experts argued that it

00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:51.049
would be impossible to have four languages at one arena. In the morning, families with children

00:21:51.049 --> 00:21:59.609
and strollers arrived. Some elderly publishers get up at 5.30 or 6 a.m., getting on the bus to be

00:21:59.609 --> 00:22:06.569
here in good time. Jehovah must be joyful seeing all the people appreciating the spiritual program

00:22:06.569 --> 00:22:20.839
and all their efforts. When the song started, 50,000 were in place here.

00:22:21.079 --> 00:22:26.359
And it was our proof that all the hard work and preparation was successful. And actually,

00:22:26.359 --> 00:22:34.460
I shared a tear of joy I did. One of the managers at the arena said, you have to stand and listen

00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:41.099
to the song, because you will never again hear a choir of 50,000 singing at the same time.

00:22:42.299 --> 00:22:55.930
You just have to listen to it. First, I want to thank you for how well it worked out.

00:22:56.650 --> 00:23:03.130
Normally, at the arrangements of this size, we are using an event agency. But you've done this

00:23:03.130 --> 00:23:10.089
for many years, and you've done a fantastic job, so it wasn't needed. You've been very professional

00:23:10.089 --> 00:23:16.490
and have knowledge of the business industry. I've told the contact persons I've been involved with,

00:23:16.490 --> 00:23:20.730
that they should start up an event agency, because it has worked out so smoothly.

00:23:20.809 --> 00:23:24.730
I can warmly recommend other cities to welcome you.

00:23:27.349 --> 00:23:32.950
You have been very well organized, and we have not had to put much effort into the arrangement.

00:23:34.309 --> 00:23:38.869
It requires a good organization to get all things to fall into place.

00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:46.950
Obviously, having so many tourists in Stockholm at the same time benefits the whole city.

00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:52.309
I looked at the number of hotel bookings, and there are not many rooms available.

00:23:53.349 --> 00:23:57.829
There are many who can learn from the work of the logistics of how to get 50,000 people

00:23:57.829 --> 00:24:02.069
into the area at the same time. That is something we can learn a lot from.

00:24:04.789 --> 00:24:11.509
We met with the police this afternoon, and they said that they have never seen such a well-organized

00:24:11.509 --> 00:24:26.089
event ever. Seeing how everything has been successful, that is a clear evidence of Jehovah's

00:24:26.089 --> 00:24:33.049
help. It's a great confirmation of one's faith. Here you really see faith in action.

00:24:33.690 --> 00:24:51.990
Here you see the foundation for a new and better world. Brothers and sisters,

00:24:52.869 --> 00:24:59.910
your generous contributions are what make theocratic events like this one possible,

00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:06.309
including the obtaining of the audio video equipment required.

00:25:06.789 --> 00:25:14.150
However, the same technology is not readily available for conventions everywhere.

00:25:15.109 --> 00:25:23.509
In some countries, large video screens or high-quality speakers are simply not obtainable

00:25:23.509 --> 00:25:29.430
due to logistical reasons or perhaps political unrest in the country.

00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:35.190
But whatever the circumstances, what's important for Jehovah's organization

00:25:35.829 --> 00:25:44.789
is that everyone is spiritually fed. Take this convention in a refugee settlement

00:25:44.789 --> 00:25:53.990
in Western Uganda as an example. Television screens were transported on unpaid roads

00:25:54.069 --> 00:26:02.789
through forest, tea plantations, and small villages. Similar setups with television screens

00:26:02.789 --> 00:26:10.230
were used in other countries as well. At times, large video walls are used,

00:26:11.029 --> 00:26:18.630
making it easier for a larger audience to see all the beautiful videos that were produced

00:26:18.630 --> 00:26:28.549
for the convention. For example, in Brazil, video screens were used at 167 regional conventions.

00:26:29.670 --> 00:26:36.230
These screens are owned by the organization and were sent to one convention

00:26:37.029 --> 00:26:44.309
after another, traveling a distance equal to more than twice around the earth.

00:26:45.269 --> 00:26:54.069
And in Sweden, a mobile control room was used to coordinate and synchronize the video

00:26:54.069 --> 00:27:01.670
and audio production of the convention in four spoken languages and three sign languages.

00:27:02.950 --> 00:27:10.390
These are only a few examples of what Jehovah's organization does in order to arrange conventions

00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:17.750
around the world to spiritually build up Jehovah's people. But this would not be possible

00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:25.029
without your contributions. Also, as was the case here in the United States,

00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:31.990
oftentimes a decision is made to purchase equipment that is used frequently

00:27:32.869 --> 00:27:38.710
instead of paying for a rental each time, which can be very expensive.

00:27:40.390 --> 00:27:47.829
Setting up for a convention in a large stadium requires a lot of coordination.

00:27:49.029 --> 00:27:52.950
So does the construction of our new world headquarters in Warwick, New York.

00:27:54.230 --> 00:28:03.029
Hundreds of volunteers arrive every week to help out all with a variety of construction skills.

00:28:03.990 --> 00:28:12.710
But one may ask, with so many people needed, how do we find the right people for the right job?

00:28:13.990 --> 00:28:22.309
The answer is, Warwick construction groups that have been set up all over the country.

00:28:31.819 --> 00:28:35.420
The Warwick construction group is basically a staffing agency.

00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:41.660
Local brothers are given the task to find and assess the construction skill level of volunteers

00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:44.059
and then forward that information to the branch.

00:28:50.099 --> 00:28:54.980
At that time, we were working with 11 RBCs, roughly 25,000 volunteers.

00:28:54.980 --> 00:29:00.579
How are we going to contact them? We sent over 200,000 emails looking for skilled volunteers

00:29:00.579 --> 00:29:05.859
in various trades. Then we hit the road, 30 different locations around the state and interviewed

00:29:05.859 --> 00:29:15.180
everyone that was interested in Warwick. Don't you think that it's even amazing that Jehovah

00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:22.779
assigns humans to do the work for him? And he calls us in 1 Corinthians 3 verse 9. He calls us

00:29:22.779 --> 00:29:39.059
fellow workers. What a beautiful expression. And what we find is everybody wants to go

00:29:40.019 --> 00:29:47.779
tomorrow and they're so willing to go to spend their own money, sacrifice their time, pay their

00:29:47.779 --> 00:29:54.019
own plane tickets and do so many things. That it's just a really encouraging thing to see such a fine

00:29:54.019 --> 00:30:01.460
willing spirit that could only exist among Jehovah's people. Volunteers have been organized into

00:30:01.460 --> 00:30:08.259
23 different trades, which are managed from the field. Volunteers receive help with any questions,

00:30:08.259 --> 00:30:13.940
arrangements or information about Bethel, as well as any Bethel training they may need.

00:30:18.839 --> 00:30:27.619
Over 7,000 interviews have already been conducted. One of the first things that my

00:30:27.619 --> 00:30:32.740
middle son just said, and he's been wanting a cow for three years, we just got him one probably

00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:39.059
about two weeks ago. And the first thing that he said when he heard that dad was asked to leave

00:30:39.059 --> 00:30:50.759
next month to go was that he'd be willing to sell his cow. Her dad's in ticket. So we're very excited

00:30:50.839 --> 00:30:56.200
about any opportunity like this to serve Jehovah in this way because we feel like this building will

00:30:56.200 --> 00:31:03.480
stand into the new system and it's a chance to have a part in something that is so special. And so

00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:07.559
we're we're pumped and we're ready for it. We have a cow for sale.

00:31:11.910 --> 00:31:16.309
The whole project of Warwick may be about building buildings, but it's the people that build them.

00:31:17.190 --> 00:31:22.630
And we've had an extremely nice privilege in meeting all of these brothers and sisters,

00:31:22.630 --> 00:31:28.549
all of them willing to go today. Many times, bad health keeps them from doing that.

00:31:29.910 --> 00:31:35.509
We've heard stories from brothers that have undergone really bad things in their life,

00:31:35.509 --> 00:31:39.589
but they're really wanting to go. One brother made the comment that his daughter had just died

00:31:39.589 --> 00:31:43.910
a few weeks before we interviewed him. And he says, I just want to go to Warwick.

00:31:45.509 --> 00:31:52.680
So I can poke Satan in the eye. When you see Jehovah's people answer the call,

00:31:52.680 --> 00:32:05.000
there's nothing better than to be part of that. Seeing these large groups of brothers and sisters

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:13.799
applying to help build the new world headquarters probably makes you wonder, how is the construction

00:32:13.799 --> 00:32:21.720
at Warwick going? Please pay attention to these images that highlight what was accomplished

00:32:21.720 --> 00:34:02.710
in recent months. For our financial contributions are important, those that volunteer on construction

00:34:02.710 --> 00:34:12.789
projects know that money alone cannot make it successful. We met a brother from Micronesia

00:34:12.789 --> 00:34:20.309
who has experience with such projects. And he has seen what he believes is clearly Jehovah's

00:34:20.389 --> 00:34:29.940
hand in matters. The buildings that we construct are vital in accomplishing Jehovah's will.

00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:37.139
Without the financial support from the brothers and sisters, we wouldn't have the funds needed

00:34:37.139 --> 00:34:44.019
to make these projects happen, but Jehovah's support far outweighs any financial support

00:34:44.019 --> 00:34:46.739
that's given. You can't replace that with anything.

00:34:47.380 --> 00:34:56.099
My name is Travis Brooks. My wife Lacey and I serve in Micronesia. Our assignment is serving in

00:34:56.099 --> 00:35:02.179
the LDC department, which is the local design construction department. We care for all the islands

00:35:02.179 --> 00:35:08.099
of Micronesia. It covers the same distance from California to New York, but if you took all those

00:35:08.099 --> 00:35:13.460
islands and put them together, it would be smaller than the state of Rhode Island. So it's very vast

00:35:13.460 --> 00:35:22.579
and spread out. We've seen Jehovah's hand many times throughout the years on our projects.

00:35:23.619 --> 00:35:30.820
One that stands out to us is the RIREP congregation in particular. This congregation had been

00:35:30.820 --> 00:35:37.059
meeting in a house for a number of years, and they'd have 70, 80, 90, and attendance at times,

00:35:37.780 --> 00:35:41.619
but they would sit outside because they couldn't fit in the house, and many of them would

00:35:41.619 --> 00:35:46.980
listen through the window or observe through the door. It would rain and they'd have a tarp set up

00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:53.219
just to try to keep dry. So we found this piece of property, but the problem was that the government

00:35:53.219 --> 00:35:59.380
had just placed a ban on dredging sand and coral out of the ocean or off the beaches. Without

00:35:59.380 --> 00:36:05.059
having that, we wouldn't be able to mix our concrete to accomplish our project. So there was one

00:36:05.059 --> 00:36:11.219
company on the island that had stockpiled sand and aggregate. We had gone to them a number of

00:36:11.219 --> 00:36:17.780
times telling them, asking them if we could purchase just eight yards of cement for our

00:36:17.780 --> 00:36:24.739
footings so that we could at least get started, and they kept denying our request and the construction

00:36:24.739 --> 00:36:31.780
overseer and myself decided we'd go one more time to that cement company and plead our case with

00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:39.619
them. When we pulled into the parking lot of the company and discussed maybe what we could say

00:36:40.579 --> 00:36:45.780
to convince them to at least sell us the eight yards that we needed. We made it a matter of

00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:52.820
prayer again, and we both exited the vehicle, and as we were approaching the doors of the company,

00:36:53.539 --> 00:36:59.380
this blue pickup pulled in and kind of intercepted us. The gentleman, local man, hopped out of his

00:36:59.380 --> 00:37:07.539
truck and said, can I help you? And he was the man who was in charge. Well, we explained our situation,

00:37:07.539 --> 00:37:12.340
and he said, well, you'll have your concrete the next morning. It was interesting about that,

00:37:12.340 --> 00:37:19.059
and which really made us feel like Jehovah had a hand in the matter, was that gentleman had just

00:37:19.059 --> 00:37:24.820
flown in the night before from another island. He had been gone for quite some time. He had

00:37:24.820 --> 00:37:32.420
pulled in, talked to us, and then hop back in his truck and drove away. So we wondered why did he

00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:38.500
pull in in the first place? Well, we didn't want to argue with it, and we just took advantage of

00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:43.539
the situation, and the next morning, seven o'clock, the truck rolled in, and we poured our footings.

00:37:45.219 --> 00:37:50.179
So we kept moving forward with the project, so we got to that stage where we would need to fill

00:37:50.179 --> 00:37:58.099
the blockwork with 80 yards of sand on an island with no sand. So again, we made it a matter of

00:37:58.179 --> 00:38:04.820
prayer, and knew that if, again, Jehovah wanted to build, it would be built. So we scoured the island

00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:11.139
again to see if there was anybody willing, and we were unsuccessful. So on our way back to the

00:38:12.019 --> 00:38:18.739
construction site, and the construction overseer, and I stopped at a store to purchase something,

00:38:18.739 --> 00:38:22.739
and we were talking to the gentleman behind the counter, explaining the situation to him,

00:38:22.739 --> 00:38:28.739
and the man asked, well, how much sand do you need? And we told him, oh, 80 yards is quite a bit,

00:38:29.380 --> 00:38:34.500
and the man said, well, I have 90 yards in my backyard. I don't have anything to do with it,

00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:39.300
so you're more than welcome to it. He said, when do you need it? He said, well, we need it

00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:45.219
more morning. And the man said, well, I have a dump truck too, so I'll see you in the morning.

00:38:45.219 --> 00:38:49.460
All the next morning, he showed up, and we were able to fill that area and move on with the project.

00:38:51.860 --> 00:38:58.500
Another experience that really stands out to me is an experience we had on the island of Yap.

00:38:58.500 --> 00:39:04.260
We were doing a renovation of a remote translation office and an extension of the

00:39:04.260 --> 00:39:08.019
Kingdom Hall because of the growth that they've had in the congregation. They've outgrown their

00:39:08.019 --> 00:39:16.179
Kingdom Hall. So for that extension, we would need cement and sand for backfill. And again,

00:39:16.179 --> 00:39:21.300
this was an island which is ironic that you can't really get sand on because there's

00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:27.380
no companies that sell it. So what you do is you go from village to village asking the village chief

00:39:28.019 --> 00:39:34.099
if he would be willing to sell sand off of his beach. Well, after visiting all the villages,

00:39:34.820 --> 00:39:40.579
no one was willing to sell any of their sand that we needed. And so we reached the last village

00:39:40.579 --> 00:39:46.980
which was willing to sell the sand. But the problem was there was a dispute between two chiefs

00:39:46.980 --> 00:39:51.539
that bordered that beach. And one chief said, now that's my sand, the other one,

00:39:51.539 --> 00:39:56.500
said it was his sand. Well, they couldn't come to an agreement, so they weren't willing to sell

00:39:56.500 --> 00:40:02.179
the sand to us. So we were at the stage where we were getting ready to need it in a few days,

00:40:02.179 --> 00:40:05.300
so we could move forward with the extension of the Kingdom Hall.

00:40:06.260 --> 00:40:10.179
With that point, things got worse because there was a typhoon approaching the island.

00:40:10.900 --> 00:40:17.699
So we just had the construction crew stop work. So the next morning we were able to get in contact

00:40:17.699 --> 00:40:22.099
with the construction overseer on the island. And he said, I've got really good news.

00:40:23.059 --> 00:40:27.940
There was no damage. The storm took a turn just before it hit the island and just grazed it.

00:40:28.900 --> 00:40:34.179
He says, I have some other good news. I just got a haul from the village chiefs.

00:40:35.380 --> 00:40:41.300
Apparently the storm surge had washed up a bunch of sand over their road to their villages

00:40:41.940 --> 00:40:47.380
and they had no way of removing it. So they said, we have plenty of sand. Can you come and help us

00:40:47.380 --> 00:40:52.260
get rid of it? So we ended up having enough sand for the rest of the project.

00:40:55.159 --> 00:41:01.639
Joel was blessing is the most important thing that we can have on our projects from the start

00:41:01.719 --> 00:41:09.559
to the finish. There will be no obstacle that can be put before you that you can't overcome.

00:41:09.559 --> 00:41:13.800
And we've seen that time. And again, the finances is an important part of the project

00:41:14.440 --> 00:41:18.920
to include when you're thinking about what projects you're going to do next and how you're going

00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:25.719
to accomplish it. But financial support doesn't create the loving atmosphere that we find on these

00:41:25.719 --> 00:41:30.920
projects. It doesn't create unity. It doesn't motivate ones to want to serve

00:41:31.559 --> 00:41:37.800
Jehovah and work hard day in and day out together with their brothers and sisters. That's where Jehovah's

00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:43.239
Spirit comes in. That's what's moving our brothers and sisters. That's what motivates us to work

00:41:43.239 --> 00:41:49.480
hard together. Without Jehovah's hand in it, like we've seen, we wouldn't accomplish what we've

00:41:49.480 --> 00:42:01.900
been able to accomplish. How exciting for the brothers in Micronesia. Our contributions are

00:42:01.900 --> 00:42:11.820
important, but only when coupled with Jehovah's blessing. The need for Kingdom Halls continues

00:42:11.820 --> 00:44:34.550
to grow worldwide. Here are some examples of recent projects and the fine results. Contributions

00:44:35.190 --> 00:44:42.869
are not only used for conventions and construction projects. As we know, they are also used for

00:44:42.869 --> 00:44:52.630
printing our publications, maintaining our website and producing videos. Starting in May of last

00:44:52.630 --> 00:45:03.349
year, the JW Broadcasting Monthly Program has been available in many languages. And the response

00:45:03.349 --> 00:45:09.750
from you dear brothers and sisters has been a great shout of appreciation to Jehovah.

00:45:11.269 --> 00:45:21.269
Please join us behind the scenes as we follow the translation process step-by-step.

00:45:37.269 --> 00:45:50.150
The governing body has asked for a long time. Our organization has been translating

00:45:50.150 --> 00:45:57.030
Bible-based printed material into hundreds of languages for many years. Video has also been

00:45:57.030 --> 00:46:03.909
included as an important part of our modern global educational work. But what unique challenges

00:46:03.909 --> 00:46:10.949
are involved in translation of a video program like JW Broadcasting. Production of this program

00:46:10.949 --> 00:46:16.630
involves creating and translating more content on a monthly basis than we have ever done before

00:46:16.630 --> 00:46:22.869
as an organization. This is required training additional teams to support the work internationally.

00:46:24.630 --> 00:46:30.710
What are the steps involved in this process? It starts when the teaching committee of the

00:46:30.710 --> 00:46:37.510
governing body approves the monthly program recorded in the studio. The video recording of the

00:46:37.510 --> 00:46:44.630
program is then passed on to the translation packaging team. They prepare a number of items that

00:46:44.630 --> 00:46:52.469
together form a translation package. For example, they create a transcript, which includes

00:46:52.469 --> 00:46:58.389
everything spoken in the program, along with any notes and explanations to help the translators

00:46:58.389 --> 00:47:05.190
around the world carry out their work. To make the translated program pleasing to watch and

00:47:05.190 --> 00:47:11.030
listen to, translated audio and subtitles must match the original length of each statement.

00:47:11.989 --> 00:47:17.989
For example, if Brother Lett speaks for 15 seconds in the original English recording,

00:47:17.989 --> 00:47:24.710
the translated version needs to also be 15 seconds. To help the translators in achieving that,

00:47:25.349 --> 00:47:30.789
the original audio recording from our studio is broken into natural segments and timed.

00:47:31.750 --> 00:47:34.949
That information is then added to the translation package.

00:47:36.550 --> 00:47:42.389
The final package is double checked for accuracy and quality before it sent to translators worldwide.

00:47:42.869 --> 00:47:47.110
The materials provided are used to immediately begin translation work,

00:47:47.110 --> 00:47:51.269
assuring that the same spiritual food is being provided in each language.

00:47:52.070 --> 00:47:57.670
The translated narration is recorded in various locations and added to the original video files.

00:47:58.469 --> 00:48:03.670
Other regions use subtitles, record translations of various sign languages,

00:48:03.670 --> 00:48:08.789
or a combination of these methods. Our brothers and sisters consider this assignment

00:48:08.789 --> 00:48:13.829
a great privilege, knowing that it is helping Jehovah's people worldwide.

00:48:22.070 --> 00:48:26.550
We can enjoy without worry. We really appreciate this.

00:48:28.070 --> 00:48:34.070
Now we feel closer to Jehovah and his organization. And of course, it pulls together my family.

00:48:36.070 --> 00:48:41.429
It touched my heart because it is in my own language. It's really wonderful to know that

00:48:41.429 --> 00:48:46.070
this arrangement has been made. It's easy to listen to, and now we only have to click

00:48:46.710 --> 00:48:58.630
to watch it in our own language. A lot of work is done here at Bethel to provide spiritual food

00:48:58.630 --> 00:49:06.789
for all of Jehovah's people. Recently, a video was produced at Bethel in Japan.

00:49:07.750 --> 00:49:13.590
It shows a group of sisters who sing about how much they love serving at Bethel.

00:49:14.070 --> 00:49:17.909
This is a short excerpt from that video.

00:50:14.969 --> 00:50:22.090
The main reasons for the construction of theocratic facilities is to support

00:50:22.809 --> 00:50:31.369
the never-to-be-repeated work of finding honest-hearted ones who want to learn more about Jehovah.

00:50:32.329 --> 00:50:37.849
One such individual is brother Steve Gertis from the United States.

00:50:39.050 --> 00:50:47.530
As a young man, his life spun out of control, and his lifestyle left him feeling empty.

00:50:48.650 --> 00:50:54.170
But what did he do to find purpose in life? Let's find out.

00:50:58.440 --> 00:51:02.360
I grew up in a small town, and I had a good childhood.

00:51:03.320 --> 00:51:10.280
My parents instilled in me from a young age, a love for God, and a respect for the Bible.

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:17.480
We were regular church attenders, and I went to a private school, and I had Bible classes each

00:51:17.480 --> 00:51:23.880
and every day. Despite all of this, however, I felt like something was missing.

00:51:24.199 --> 00:51:32.599
When I was 15, my life changed in a moment's notice. I was playing high up in a tree,

00:51:32.599 --> 00:51:40.599
the branch broke, I fell to the ground, and I was paralyzed. At that moment, I went from an

00:51:40.599 --> 00:51:48.039
active kid who could run to one who was paralyzed from his neck down. I couldn't feel anything.

00:51:48.440 --> 00:51:56.599
By the time I was 18, I gained enough physical strength in my arms that I once again had my

00:51:56.599 --> 00:52:06.840
independence. At that point, I attended a university and lived on campus. My life changed dramatically

00:52:06.840 --> 00:52:16.599
once again. Here I was exposed to drugs, alcohol, immorality, and I fell into that lifestyle.

00:52:17.559 --> 00:52:23.960
Every night, though, I still read the Bible. I still had this strong faith in God.

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:31.639
But, when I prayed and went to sleep at night, I just knew I was going to end up in that

00:52:31.639 --> 00:52:41.530
hellfire that I had been taught from an early age. During this time, I met a girl named Julie,

00:52:41.530 --> 00:52:48.489
and we were married shortly after. She was in the same hippie lifestyle that I was in,

00:52:48.969 --> 00:52:54.409
and we knew if we were going to stay married, we had to move away from our bad influence.

00:52:55.449 --> 00:53:02.650
We were looking for God, and we wanted Him in our life. One day, I was in the park by myself.

00:53:03.369 --> 00:53:08.730
It was a beautiful setting. There was a lake in front of me, mountain in the background,

00:53:09.530 --> 00:53:16.409
and at that point, I said a prayer to God. I told Him that we wanted to serve Him,

00:53:16.489 --> 00:53:24.409
but we just didn't know how. About 10 minutes later, a guy walked up, and he started talking to me

00:53:24.409 --> 00:53:30.329
about a paradise Earth. Everything he said made sense. I had read it before.

00:53:31.449 --> 00:53:37.610
The thing that really stood out to me was his explanation on hellfire. It was so clear,

00:53:37.610 --> 00:53:44.809
it was so logical, it just made sense to me. He invited us to the Kingdom Hall the next day,

00:53:44.809 --> 00:53:51.690
and we went. My wife and I will never forget that first meeting 37 years ago.

00:53:52.250 --> 00:53:59.210
I had my long hair, holes in my jeans. I don't think I even wore shoes that first time.

00:53:59.849 --> 00:54:05.849
As we're sitting there, I'm thinking that the older brother who's conducting on stage,

00:54:06.489 --> 00:54:13.849
he's going to find us so disgusting. But to our surprise, right after the meeting, he came up,

00:54:14.409 --> 00:54:20.969
he greeted us and invited us to spend time with his family. We don't remember anything that

00:54:20.969 --> 00:54:27.289
was said at that meeting, but we'll never forget the greeting. We immediately started attending

00:54:27.289 --> 00:54:33.130
all the meetings at the Kingdom Hall and also began a Bible study with the brother we met in the

00:54:33.130 --> 00:54:40.730
park. The changes in our lifestyle did not come overnight, but the brothers were so loving and

00:54:40.730 --> 00:54:48.650
patient with us. We now had a purpose in life. The emptiness that I had felt for so long was no

00:54:48.650 --> 00:54:56.409
longer there. We no longer had to live in that self-centered lifestyle. Now we had Jehovah,

00:54:56.409 --> 00:55:03.610
we had the brothers, we had the ministry. We made our dedication to Jehovah and were baptized.

00:55:04.570 --> 00:55:13.449
Julian, I have had a fruitful ministry over the years. It's always been one of our goals that we

00:55:13.449 --> 00:55:20.329
and our two younger children would be able to one day regular pioneer together. We discussed

00:55:20.329 --> 00:55:26.650
could we make a move to Mexico and serve where there was a greater need. We knew there would be

00:55:26.650 --> 00:55:33.530
challenges with accessibility and learning a new culture. So we made the decision to try

00:55:33.530 --> 00:55:39.849
it as a family for one year. And now four years later, we are all still serving in the full-time

00:55:39.849 --> 00:55:48.570
ministry here in Mexico. I also live with pain every day and some thought that I would not have

00:55:48.570 --> 00:55:55.210
the physical strength to make such a move. But I always remember that when I'm in the ministry,

00:55:55.849 --> 00:56:03.289
I don't feel the pain. In fact, my children have said that I hope Dad never has to stop pioneering

00:56:03.849 --> 00:56:11.369
because that's when he's the happiest. Pioneering really seems to be getting easier for me,

00:56:11.369 --> 00:56:17.690
not harder. I know this isn't because of my strength, but it's Jehovah's Holy Spirit.

00:56:18.969 --> 00:56:25.449
I still love the parks as I did when I was young, but now I have the opportunity to share the

00:56:25.449 --> 00:56:33.449
wonderful Bible hope with others. I'm so thankful to Jehovah that he heard that prayer in the park

00:56:33.449 --> 00:56:40.570
many years ago. My life is now filled with peace, happiness, and contentment.

00:56:41.530 --> 00:56:50.090
And now I look forward to the time soon. When we're in the paradise, I can get rid of this wheelchair

00:56:50.090 --> 00:57:02.409
and I can run once again. Brother Gertis has been serving as an elder for the past 25 years,

00:57:03.050 --> 00:57:11.960
and as a regular pioneer for the last 13 years. Although financial contributions

00:57:12.840 --> 00:57:20.519
are one means of giving to Jehovah, giving of our time and effort is also very important.

00:57:21.480 --> 00:57:28.360
And we want to commend all of you who reach out, perhaps deserve in the full-time ministry,

00:57:29.079 --> 00:57:35.480
or where the need is greater. If you're a parent and your children have put Kingdom

00:57:35.480 --> 00:57:45.880
Interest first, we're confident that you are very proud of them. This music video highlights

00:57:45.880 --> 00:57:54.599
common emotions that you may be facing, similar to how Hannah felt when she dedicated her son,

00:57:54.599 --> 00:58:05.000
Samuel, to a life of service to Jehovah. The song is entitled, I give you my best.

00:58:05.159 --> 01:01:15.579
The Seasuch sacrifices of time and effort to Jehovah. It's not easy for parents to see their children

01:01:15.579 --> 01:01:20.139
move to a place far away, and it's not easy for the children either.

01:01:21.340 --> 01:01:29.260
But knowing that it's for Jehovah helps to remain desolate, and Jehovah provides the strength

01:01:29.260 --> 01:01:35.820
that is needed. And speaking of serving Jehovah wholeheartedly, if you haven't seen it yet,

01:01:36.619 --> 01:01:44.300
we encourage you to watch an interview with three brothers who spent decades in the traveling

01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:53.260
work. Their experiences are available in the Video On Demand section. The video is entitled,

01:01:54.219 --> 01:02:03.579
Iron Sharpens Iron. Just like those faithful brothers, we are truly grateful for the privilege

01:02:03.579 --> 01:02:13.179
of being part of God's organization. And we want to again commend all of you for your generous

01:02:13.179 --> 01:02:21.659
support. And we've seen examples during this program of what has been accomplished using donated

01:02:21.659 --> 01:02:31.420
funds. There is no doubt that Jehovah is blessing all our efforts to speed up the work

01:02:32.219 --> 01:02:41.980
as his day is getting ever closer. We would like to conclude our JW Broadcasting program

01:02:42.780 --> 01:02:49.980
with these greetings from a Kingdom Hall build in the state of Louisiana in the United States.

01:02:51.179 --> 01:02:58.380
This congregation in Yunus was in need of a new Kingdom Hall after having used the same building

01:02:58.380 --> 01:03:06.380
since 1970. The congregation found a property that had been for sale for more than five years.

01:03:07.340 --> 01:03:15.900
Our brothers contacted the owners who then decided to donate the property to the witnesses.

01:03:16.940 --> 01:03:27.500
It was later assessed to be worth $40,000 US dollars. Recently, construction began and the 53

01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:36.699
publishers, including four elders and seven regular pioneers, now enjoy a brand new Kingdom Hall.

01:03:38.059 --> 01:03:45.179
They send their love and greetings to you. And we do the same from World Headquarters

01:03:45.179 --> 01:03:56.860
to all of you brothers and sisters around the world. We love you very much. This is JW Broadcasting.

01:03:57.500 --> 01:04:06.139
From Brooklyn, New York.
