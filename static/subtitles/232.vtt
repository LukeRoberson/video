WEBVTT

00:00:02.029 --> 00:00:12.029
We would like to welcome all of you to a special broadcast from the World Headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:00:12.029 --> 00:00:25.030
As you may have already heard yesterday, April 20th, the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation ruled against Jehovah's Witnesses

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:37.030
and decided to liquidate the administrative center of Jehovah's Witnesses in Russia and all 395 local religious organizations.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:49.030
In essence, this means that the properties owned by the organization, such as our Kingdom Halls and our beautiful branch office,

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:57.030
have been unjustly confiscated by the Russian government.

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.030
The ruling goes into effect immediately.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:14.030
Our hearts go out to you dear brothers and sisters in Russia, but we know that you deeply appreciate the support given to you by the Worldwide Brotherhood.

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:22.030
Just think of how many letters were sent to Russian officials by your fellow worshippers around the world.

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:32.030
Contemplate how many prayers and supplications were offered up to Jehovah and will continue to be made in your behalf.

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:39.030
Your confidence in Jehovah warms our heart.

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:51.030
In just a moment, we will be speaking with Brother Mark Sanderson, who was present in the courtroom when the decision was announced.

00:01:51.030 --> 00:02:06.030
However, before speaking with him, we know you will be very interested in this account of the six days of proceedings that led up to this very disappointing decision.

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:20.030
The report includes comments from a delegation of brothers sent by the governing body to meet with officials and to be present for portions of the trial.

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:37.770
Well, the governing body assigned me to come here, not only for the trial that's to take place today, but also to try and see if we could do something to encourage our brothers here on a small scale.

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.770
When we arrived at the airport, there was a large group of brothers.

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:54.770
Many of them were of considerable size. They just kind of shepherded us through the airport and we were standing there with them for a few minutes and one of the brothers suddenly smiled.

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:58.770
And he said to me in Russian, thank you so much for coming.

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:29.340
The fundamental question in this case is whether Jehovah's Witnesses are engaged in extremist activity,

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:36.340
and whether the administrative center is guilty of having organized this extremist activity.

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:49.340
When it became known that the Supreme Court of Russia was considering a ban on the worship of Jehovah's Witnesses, embassies from around the world requested information as to what led up to this.

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:56.340
We were successful in getting high level meetings with a number of different officials at embassies here in Moscow.

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:03.340
And it's really been quite impressive to see the reaction of these people in high station.

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:12.340
It impressed me that so many of them were eager to want to do something within the limited sphere that they have.

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:24.339
And uniformly, they are just amazed that Jehovah's Witnesses of all people are subject to criticism or ban on the basis of being extremist.

00:04:24.339 --> 00:04:35.339
Now that comes across to them as completely absurd because if there's one group of people that's known for their neutrality, it is Jehovah's people.

00:04:35.339 --> 00:04:42.339
Really now our eyes are poised toward the trial, we're getting ready to go to the court and we'll wait and see what's going to happen.

00:04:42.339 --> 00:04:52.279
As we were going to the court, there were about 200 waiting to get into the courtroom.

00:04:52.279 --> 00:05:02.279
Mostly our brothers, but then some who were just interested in the hearing, we could see the cameraman, the microphones and the many reporters who were there.

00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:06.279
It was clear that this was now an international event.

00:05:06.279 --> 00:05:10.279
Just when we were in the entrance way, we stepped in.

00:05:10.279 --> 00:05:15.279
Here was a couple that I had met many years ago in Siberia.

00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:20.279
And here they had come all the way from Siberia to testify and they hear it to be witnesses.

00:05:20.279 --> 00:05:27.009
We have four different brothers representing the administrative center.

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:30.009
Each one would take the lead in arguing one motion.

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:39.009
The judge would listen to what the brothers had to say, turn to the Ministry of Justice and ask, does the Ministry of Justice have any input on this?

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:47.009
The prosecutor would stand, literally say two or three sentences, sit down and the judge would say,

00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:58.009
the brothers raised 20 motions that they wanted the court to hear.

00:05:58.009 --> 00:06:09.009
Of those 20 motions, the court granted only two of them to see how evidence that would exonerate us was not going to be allowed in the hearing.

00:06:09.009 --> 00:06:16.009
After seeing so many of them beat us, then you began to see, well, they really weren't going to take any of them seriously.

00:06:17.009 --> 00:06:32.009
For example, the brothers were able to show clearly that the congregations that had been liquidated were the result of planting of literature and that this was on video and that the Supreme Court would refuse to even see the video.

00:06:32.009 --> 00:06:37.009
And that was really our lasting impression that this was a little bit of a sham.

00:06:38.009 --> 00:06:47.009
And it was designed to go through the formalities, but you got the sense that the decision had already been taken.

00:06:47.009 --> 00:07:03.009
At the hearing, representatives from many embassies were there. And as they listened to the court here, where their local congregations would be allowed to defend themselves, and to hear that the court said, no, they were not going to be heard.

00:07:03.009 --> 00:07:07.009
These embassy representatives were appalled.

00:07:07.009 --> 00:07:28.009
And I thought it was quite interesting that when they saw how ridiculous some of the rejection of the motions were at the trial, there was a murmur of laughter in the audience, particularly when the judge cut off our lawyers, when they were presenting the evidence of the planted publications.

00:07:28.009 --> 00:07:38.009
This to them is evidence that it's so absurd that you haven't got the real evidence to bring a charge of extremism, so you plant evidence.

00:07:38.009 --> 00:07:46.009
Although we were in the Supreme Court, they don't have so many formalities in the court as perhaps they have in other lands.

00:07:46.009 --> 00:07:49.009
And so the brothers were allowed to stand up and walk around.

00:07:49.009 --> 00:07:55.009
To me, more had the atmosphere of a circuit assembly than being in a courtroom.

00:07:55.009 --> 00:08:01.009
I think it made the charge that's been brought upon us all the more absurd and ridiculous.

00:08:01.009 --> 00:08:11.009
You know, just so many came up and said how grateful they were to feel the support from the governing body, that they were not facing the situation alone.

00:08:11.009 --> 00:08:16.009
It occurred to me that it was really a small thing, you know, to travel here.

00:08:16.009 --> 00:08:23.610
But for them, it was symbolic. They felt that the governing body was there with them.

00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:44.669
The decision has not been made. We'll have to wait and see.

00:08:44.669 --> 00:08:51.669
The government had only given us a six-day visa, and so it was impossible for us to stay any longer.

00:08:51.669 --> 00:08:58.669
So our entire delegation, of course, with the exception of Brother Colin, we all had to leave the next day.

00:08:58.669 --> 00:09:08.669
But we had in our mind that we were going to go and strengthen them, but as is always the case, I think we were the ones who came away, even more strengthened in our own faith.

00:09:08.669 --> 00:09:13.669
One ten-year-old wrote this note to the visiting delegation.

00:09:13.669 --> 00:09:17.669
Thank you for coming to support us and for your ministry.

00:09:17.669 --> 00:09:22.669
Sasha, ten years old, Moscow.

00:09:22.669 --> 00:09:30.669
As we were leaving and saying goodbye to these brothers, there was not a dry eye among us.

00:09:30.669 --> 00:09:38.669
They were hugging Brother Sanderson and telling him, this is the spiritual high point of my life.

00:09:38.669 --> 00:09:47.379
Something occurred in day two that was unexpected and surprising to us.

00:09:47.379 --> 00:09:54.379
Interestingly, the judge became very active, and he began to really question the Ministry of Justice.

00:09:54.379 --> 00:10:01.379
Why are you bringing this case? What evidence do you have that they are engaged in extremist activities?

00:10:02.379 --> 00:10:07.379
Are there any personal experiences of the citizens?

00:10:07.379 --> 00:10:17.379
Are there any cases that kidnapped and attacked the government that are responsible for the attack of this separatist movement?

00:10:17.379 --> 00:10:24.379
Are there any threats that will cause a criminal attack over such citizens?

00:10:24.379 --> 00:10:28.980
Well, if the citizens are united, then, well, of course, they will survive.

00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:39.379
The third day of the hearing reminded us of Matthew 10, 18, and you will be brought before governors and kings.

00:10:39.379 --> 00:10:55.029
The third day of the hearing reminded us of Matthew 10, 18.

00:10:55.029 --> 00:11:01.029
And you will be brought before governors and kings for my sake, but then what's the reason?

00:11:01.029 --> 00:11:06.029
It says, for a witness to them and the nations.

00:11:06.029 --> 00:11:14.029
The international community worldwide has now heard the testimony of six Jawah's witnesses clearly,

00:11:14.029 --> 00:11:20.029
cogently, convincingly explaining to the court that we are law abiding peaceful citizens,

00:11:20.029 --> 00:11:23.029
the farthest thing from extremist.

00:11:23.029 --> 00:11:30.029
For example, one long time member of Jawah's witnesses, Vasilie Colin, explained to the judge that as a child,

00:11:30.029 --> 00:11:36.029
he had been forced into exile with his parents and was forced to live in Siberia for years.

00:11:37.029 --> 00:11:40.029
Vasilie, we have a lot of comrades in the city of the 20th century.

00:11:40.029 --> 00:11:44.029
There are no human conditions for them.

00:11:44.029 --> 00:11:48.029
But for me, it was interesting for me, one condition of this matter.

00:11:48.029 --> 00:11:54.029
My parents, and also any witness of his, have been forced to run away from this society.

00:11:54.029 --> 00:11:58.029
You can do whatever you want to do.

00:11:58.029 --> 00:12:01.029
Write a comment on what you want.

00:12:01.029 --> 00:12:06.029
It is interesting that you are willing and therefore you are willing to live in a wrong way,

00:12:06.029 --> 00:12:09.029
in order for someone to get such an opportunity.

00:12:09.029 --> 00:12:12.029
But such an opportunity was enough for me.

00:12:12.029 --> 00:12:16.029
And it is only because they are not willing to be willing.

00:12:16.029 --> 00:12:19.029
Today, nothing has changed.

00:12:31.029 --> 00:12:35.029
The charges against him have now been expunged.

00:12:35.029 --> 00:12:39.029
And now, at this point in his life, they are saying he is an extremist.

00:12:39.029 --> 00:12:48.029
Anyone could see that the same efforts that had been made so long ago to try to hunt down and wipe out Jawah's witnesses

00:12:48.029 --> 00:12:52.029
were just reappearing now at this particular time.

00:12:52.029 --> 00:13:02.700
I was texting with one of the brothers at the Russia branch asking how things were going.

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:11.700
He says, wow, they just announced that the court has been suspended until Wednesday, April 12th,

00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:13.700
the day after the memorial.

00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:18.700
And we were all just, we could hardly believe it, that the court is ending on a Friday,

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:21.700
but being postponed until Wednesday.

00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:23.700
How wonderful.

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:30.700
Because we realized that we could spend the evening calmly until the decision of the court.

00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:33.700
This was the answer to our prayer.

00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:43.620
The fourth day, our witness was released.

00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:48.620
This is our brother, the sister, in which there is a scientific study,

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:54.620
they told us how the Bible helped them to change their life better,

00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:59.620
that they can combine scientific work with religious activity.

00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:04.620
And at this point, the witnesses were released from the foreign ministry of the United States,

00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:09.620
who tried to convince the court that the witnesses have a higher education,

00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:13.620
that they all work on the low paid work,

00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:18.620
and that all of them are slaves of some kind of democratic state.

00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:25.620
We had an adjournment up to April 19th.

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:31.620
That gives the brotherhood in Russia the opportunity to attend the special talk.

00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:34.620
And that special talk is all about peace,

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:37.620
how to cultivate peace in an angry world.

00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:43.620
So we really hope to be in the courtroom with our brothers at the time when the decision is issued.

00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:49.620
Or even though it would seem almost impossible that we could get a visa to return to Russia,

00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:53.620
basically, we would have to make application from Kazakhstan.

00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:56.620
If Jehovah wills, and we're able to get the visa,

00:14:56.620 --> 00:14:59.620
then Tuesday evening, I'll return to Russia,

00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:03.620
and then on Wednesday morning, we will be in the court.

00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:10.740
Brothers were hugging each other.

00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:14.740
At lunchtime, everybody was sharing their sandwiches with each other.

00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:19.740
The atmosphere of joy and love was unforgettable.

00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:23.740
The judge began to go through all of the evidence.

00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:29.740
And so there were 43 volumes of evidence that had been brought forth in the trial,

00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:33.740
either by the Ministry of Justice or by our attorneys.

00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:37.740
And so every one of those volumes had to be reviewed.

00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:41.740
And so it was kind of a long process.

00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:44.740
Our attorneys were able to ask the Ministry of Justice,

00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:52.740
you know, where is the evidence that funding from the Administrative Center was used for any improper activities?

00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:55.740
And it's just as long as it is today.

00:15:55.740 --> 00:16:01.740
And so the brothers came back, well, tell me how much money, how many rubles, how many copex were spent?

00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:04.740
You know, to fund this improper activity.

00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:08.740
And I mean, well, we don't have any information like that.

00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:14.740
We're sure that now, we've won this trial.

00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:18.740
Even before the decision was made, we won it spiritually.

00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:21.740
I think that in the history of the people of God in Russia,

00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:28.740
this trial was a peak of interest and popularity among the population of our country.

00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:37.740
And whenever the press, public activities in general, they didn't have interest in the people of Meogov and me.

00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:50.620
I'm not sure if the decision was made, but the decision was made.

00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:55.620
And I'd like to know who the third party of the administration is, and where the second party is.

00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:59.620
And here, the government of the Republic and the government of Russia,

00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:03.620
and although there are some local organizations,

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:24.420
If Anna was quite a surprise to me that one single judge could deliberate on six days

00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:30.779
of evidence and within an hour come back and ban a religion from practicing its faith.

00:17:30.779 --> 00:17:35.740
In one part of the body suffers, we all suffer and that would be the feeling throughout

00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:37.700
the world I'm sure.

00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:42.140
We will allow Jehovah our God to correct the injustices.

00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:44.660
We will continue to be peaceable with all men.

00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:52.019
We will never return evil for evil to anybody.

00:17:52.019 --> 00:17:58.500
We have brother Mark Sanderson of the governing body tied in with us and we're so happy

00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:04.339
to have you with us Mark and first we just like to thank you very much for

00:18:04.339 --> 00:18:11.819
making the trip to Russia, Moscow to be with the brothers during this critical time.

00:18:11.819 --> 00:18:17.900
And we heard so many comments about how much the brothers appreciated having you there

00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:18.900
with them.

00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:23.559
Oh, thank you so much, Steve.

00:18:23.559 --> 00:18:29.119
You know, to stand unitedly with our brothers in Russia in that courtroom when they were facing

00:18:29.119 --> 00:18:33.920
such a vicious attack on their worship from the devil was a tremendous privilege.

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:38.839
I have to say, you know, in all my years in serving Jehovah, I don't think I ever felt

00:18:38.839 --> 00:18:44.519
so proud to be one of Jehovah's Witnesses as when I was standing in that courtroom.

00:18:44.519 --> 00:18:46.720
Very encouraging, Mark.

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:53.039
But tell us please a little more about what was the reaction of the brothers when they

00:18:53.039 --> 00:18:58.759
heard this negative decision?

00:18:58.759 --> 00:19:02.839
You know, Steve, to understand their reaction, I think we have to just kind of recap with

00:19:02.839 --> 00:19:07.279
what's been happening because for the last couple of days, you know, there has been such

00:19:07.279 --> 00:19:10.000
a joyful spirit in the courtroom.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:16.279
The brothers and sisters have been walking around, greeting one another, taking photographs,

00:19:16.279 --> 00:19:17.920
you know, hugging one another.

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:23.200
There's just been this tremendous joyful feeling within this courtroom.

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:27.799
And so then just before the decision was given, we heard the closing statements from our

00:19:27.799 --> 00:19:33.400
four attorneys, and also from brother Sergei Cheropanov and brother Vasili Kalin, who

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:36.440
are both on the branch committee in Russia.

00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:40.920
And you know, these brothers made such powerful statements.

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:46.680
Their arguments were so compelling that, you know, we all felt just very pumped up by

00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:47.680
what they said.

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:53.200
And then one of the statements that several of these brothers made was that really it's

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:57.519
not, we're not really standing before the Russian Supreme Court.

00:19:57.519 --> 00:20:03.440
But really, the great judge of the universe, Jehovah, is the one who's judging all matters.

00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:09.039
And they reminded everyone in that courtroom that everyone is going to have to stand before

00:20:09.039 --> 00:20:11.079
the judgment seat of God.

00:20:11.079 --> 00:20:16.000
And when we heard that, we all just felt so inspired, you know, by those comments.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:21.960
Well, then after a few moments when the judge actually issued his decision, and the brothers

00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:29.519
and sisters heard that it was negative, you know, it was just totally silent in the courtroom.

00:20:29.519 --> 00:20:33.599
There was no, there was no outcry, there was no comment.

00:20:33.599 --> 00:20:35.279
Some of the brothers shook their head.

00:20:35.279 --> 00:20:42.000
I think we were just all in total disbelief that the judge could issue such an unjust

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:47.799
decision after hearing these, these tremendous arguments from our brothers.

00:20:47.799 --> 00:20:54.000
I have to say, although we were stunned by the unjust decision, there was no hint in

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.960
that courtroom that our brothers are backing down, that they're cowering, or that they're

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:01.319
going to give up their service to Jehovah.

00:21:01.319 --> 00:21:07.220
In fact, you could see that they were even strengthened by this decision to go on serving

00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:11.480
Jehovah faithfully under their new circumstances.

00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:16.200
Those comments mark are so heartening to us to hear.

00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:24.519
But even though there was a negative decision, how would you say that a great shout of praise

00:21:24.519 --> 00:21:29.509
has gone up to Jehovah's name?

00:21:29.509 --> 00:21:34.190
You know, Steve, I just keep coming back to what Jesus said in Matthew chapter 10 and

00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:35.509
verse 18.

00:21:35.509 --> 00:21:41.789
He said that we would be brought before kings and governors for a witness to them and

00:21:41.789 --> 00:21:43.150
to the nations.

00:21:43.150 --> 00:21:45.910
Well, that's exactly what's happened here.

00:21:45.910 --> 00:21:52.069
We have been brought before kings and governors, but what a tremendous witness has been given

00:21:52.069 --> 00:21:53.670
to them and to the nations.

00:21:53.670 --> 00:21:56.589
For example, we did this letter writing campaign.

00:21:56.589 --> 00:21:59.829
Our brothers participated all around the world.

00:21:59.829 --> 00:22:06.710
And then the news media caught on to that and many newspapers and other media outlets reported

00:22:06.710 --> 00:22:11.910
on this tremendous effort to write letters to the officials of the Russian government.

00:22:11.910 --> 00:22:17.430
In the delegation that was sent by the governing body to Moscow, we were able to meet with three

00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:23.230
different ambassadors from the largest countries on this earth.

00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:28.589
And these ambassadors who are so difficult to meet with welcomed us in, they listened

00:22:28.589 --> 00:22:34.109
to us patiently and they showed that they had a very deep respect for Jehovah's witnesses

00:22:34.109 --> 00:22:39.829
being very familiar with our work and really wanting to do things to help Jehovah's people.

00:22:39.829 --> 00:22:41.589
It was wonderful.

00:22:41.589 --> 00:22:47.750
And then consider all the media coverage that's been taking place on the court case day after

00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:49.710
day after day.

00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:52.309
And now we have a decision.

00:22:52.309 --> 00:22:57.349
And so now this court decision is going to be publicized by the media all over the world

00:22:57.349 --> 00:22:58.710
again.

00:22:58.710 --> 00:23:03.509
And still to come, we have our appeals that are going to be made in the Russian Supreme

00:23:03.509 --> 00:23:08.869
Court, in the European Court of Human Rights with the Human Rights Commission.

00:23:08.869 --> 00:23:12.390
All of this is going to result in more publicity.

00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:15.509
And in the end, really, what can we say?

00:23:15.509 --> 00:23:20.750
Well, people who know Jehovah's Witnesses, people who have Jehovah's Witnesses as their

00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:26.630
neighbors, as their workmates, as their schoolmates, who really know who we are, when they hear

00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:32.269
these reports, they are going to immediately recognize that these charges are ridiculous

00:23:32.269 --> 00:23:33.670
and absurd.

00:23:33.670 --> 00:23:38.549
And they are perhaps even going to want to ask questions and perhaps even become interested

00:23:38.549 --> 00:23:39.549
in the truth.

00:23:39.549 --> 00:23:46.069
So, even through this negative decision, Jehovah's name is being exalted and glorified

00:23:46.069 --> 00:23:47.869
in all the earth.

00:23:47.869 --> 00:23:52.950
That is so wonderful, Brother Sanderson, what you've expressed.

00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:59.190
And one thing that we're just so happy about is that the brothers were able to celebrate

00:23:59.190 --> 00:24:05.869
the memorial of Christ's death before the negative decision was rendered.

00:24:05.869 --> 00:24:07.190
I know many of us.

00:24:07.269 --> 00:24:09.990
I was praying and others were praying.

00:24:09.990 --> 00:24:14.150
If it be Jehovah's will, of course, we always want his will to take place.

00:24:14.150 --> 00:24:19.509
But if it was his will, then at least they could celebrate the memorial in peace.

00:24:19.509 --> 00:24:21.750
And so that happened and we're so happy.

00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:25.619
Yes, that was my prayer too.

00:24:25.619 --> 00:24:31.259
And really, when the decision was made to adjourn the court until the day after the memorial,

00:24:31.259 --> 00:24:36.339
we really had to see Jehovah's hand in it because across Russia, now that all the reports

00:24:36.339 --> 00:24:42.339
have come in, we understand that only in three cases did the police come to a location

00:24:42.339 --> 00:24:44.859
where the memorial was being celebrated.

00:24:44.859 --> 00:24:48.819
But even in those cases, they did not attempt to disturb the occasion.

00:24:48.819 --> 00:24:54.019
So we can say that our brothers were able to celebrate the memorial all across Russia

00:24:54.019 --> 00:24:55.380
in peace.

00:24:55.380 --> 00:25:00.259
And of course, even with the special talk, because again, the court adjourned, the special

00:25:00.259 --> 00:25:03.779
talk was also held across Russia in peace.

00:25:03.779 --> 00:25:09.539
And so, in a mighty way, Jehovah stood by his people and allowed them to have these two

00:25:09.539 --> 00:25:13.539
very important spiritual occasions before this decision.

00:25:13.539 --> 00:25:16.380
We thank Jehovah for that blessing.

00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:22.099
And we thank you, Mark, for those very encouraging comments.

00:25:22.099 --> 00:25:28.660
And we thank you again for representing the governing body there in Russia and supporting

00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:29.980
the brothers.

00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:37.880
We really appreciate it and please travel home safely.

00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:38.880
Thank you so much, Steve.

00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:43.480
It was such a wonderful privilege to be able to be in Russia with our dear brothers at

00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:44.880
this historic moment.

00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:50.740
I look forward to seeing you when I return.

00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:57.019
And we would like to thank all of you for your support.

00:25:57.019 --> 00:26:01.099
Your dear brothers and sisters gave heartfelt prayers.

00:26:01.099 --> 00:26:04.940
You willingly supported the letter writing campaign.

00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:10.500
For some of you sending a letter to one or more of the six Russian officials came at a

00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:12.579
great expense.

00:26:12.579 --> 00:26:20.180
We commend you for your strong love for your brothers in Russia and for your loyalty

00:26:20.180 --> 00:26:23.259
to Jehovah's organization.

00:26:23.259 --> 00:26:30.380
But does the Supreme Court's decision against us mean that the letter writing campaign failed?

00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:34.140
Are that Jehovah did not hear our prayers?

00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:36.859
Absolutely not.

00:26:36.859 --> 00:26:44.059
It simply means that we have yet to see how Jehovah will maneuver events and harmony

00:26:44.059 --> 00:26:45.900
with his will.

00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:53.019
In the meantime, we are confident that our dear brothers and sisters in Russia will remain

00:26:53.019 --> 00:27:00.579
steadfast and that Psalm 112, 7 or 8 will be true of them.

00:27:00.579 --> 00:27:09.019
There it says of Jehovah's righteous one, he will not fear bad news.

00:27:09.019 --> 00:27:14.579
His heart is steadfast, trusting in Jehovah.

00:27:14.579 --> 00:27:17.819
His heart is unshakable.

00:27:17.819 --> 00:27:20.859
He is not afraid.

00:27:20.859 --> 00:27:30.059
In the end, he will look and triumph on his adversaries.

00:27:30.059 --> 00:27:36.460
As long as we are still living in this old system, as we have seen in Russia and many

00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:46.099
other lands, we can expect persecution for simply wanting to worship Jehovah in peace.

00:27:46.099 --> 00:27:49.180
But do we need to fear such persecution?

00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:51.180
No.

00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:59.579
Jesus Christ and the heavenly armies are ready to take the lead in defending Jehovah's people.

00:27:59.579 --> 00:28:08.940
We can rest assured that according to Isaiah 54, 17, no weapon formed against us will have

00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:11.299
any success.

00:28:11.299 --> 00:28:13.380
And why?

00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:19.220
Because Jehovah is on our side.

00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:28.619
May we all continue to pray for our dear brothers and sisters in Russia whom we love very

00:28:28.619 --> 00:28:30.619
much.

00:28:30.619 --> 00:28:38.779
This is JW Broadcasting from the World Headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses.
