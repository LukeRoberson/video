00:00:01.169 --> 00:00:06.669
As we continue our consideration of the promises of peace in Isaiah's prophecies,

00:00:06.669 --> 00:00:10.669
I'd like you to imagine an Israelite living in Babylon.

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:16.170
Now, he's just learned that Jews can return to Jerusalem and help to rebuild the temple.

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:22.670
So he must decide if he and his family will leave Babylon to make the long trip to his homeland.

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.170
What might he consider?

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.670
Well, after 70 years, the land must have changed.

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:36.170
Fields would be overgrown with weeds, wolves, leopards, lions, and bears must freely walk in the fields.

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.170
Snakes make their home there.

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.170
So he might ask himself,

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.170
will my domestic animals be killed by predators?

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.170
Will my small children be bitten by snakes?

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:54.170
And what about the danger of fierce men attacking us on the journey home?

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:01.170
Well, any such fears could be dispelled by considering the prophecy at Isaiah chapter 11 verses 6 through 9.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.170
Let's read that together.

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.170
Isaiah chapter 11,

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.170
and notice this promise of peace starting in verse 6.

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.170
The wolf will reside for a while with the lamb,

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.670
and with the young goat, the leopard will lie down,

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.670
and the calf and the lion and the fat and animal will all be together.

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.170
And a little boy will lead them.

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:31.670
The cow and the bear will feed together, and their young will lie down together.

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.170
The lion will eat straw like the bull.

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.170
The nursing child will play over the layer of a cobra,

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.670
and a wing child would put his hand over the den of a poisonous snake.

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.670
They will not cause any harm or any ruin in all my holy mountain,

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:57.670
because the earth will certainly be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah as the waters cover the sea.

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.170
What a beautiful promise of peace!

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:08.669
Jews wouldn't need to fear wild animals or fierce men on their journey home or in their restored land.

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:10.669
With these poetic words,

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:14.669
Jehovah assured the exiles that they and their livestock would be safe.

00:02:14.669 --> 00:02:17.669
He would bless them with peace.

00:02:17.669 --> 00:02:20.169
And did you notice, according to verse 7,

00:02:20.169 --> 00:02:23.669
the lion would symbolically eat straw,

00:02:23.669 --> 00:02:27.669
illustrating that lions wouldn't kill the Jews cattle.

00:02:27.669 --> 00:02:34.169
Faithful ones would have nothing to fear from animal or human predators.

00:02:34.169 --> 00:02:37.669
Do we see this prophecy being fulfilled in our day?

00:02:37.669 --> 00:02:43.169
Not with the literal animals, but we do see a spiritual fulfillment.

00:02:43.169 --> 00:02:46.169
Notice again the end of verse 9.

00:02:46.169 --> 00:02:51.169
It says the earth will certainly be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah.

00:02:51.169 --> 00:02:55.169
Now does the knowledge of Jehovah change the behavior of animals?

00:02:55.169 --> 00:02:59.169
No, but the knowledge of God does change people.

00:02:59.169 --> 00:03:07.169
In our day, the knowledge of Jehovah helps people who are violent to transform their personality and become peaceable.

00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:11.169
In harmony with Colossians chapter 3 verse 10,

00:03:11.169 --> 00:03:15.169
these ones have clothed themselves with the new personality.

00:03:15.169 --> 00:03:23.169
They've stripped off animalistic violent tendencies and transformed their lives in harmony with what the Bible teaches.

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:26.169
They get along peaceably with others.

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:30.169
Perhaps you know someone who made such changes.

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:36.169
Or perhaps you made these changes, leaving behind a violent way of life.

00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:39.169
Let me share with you such an experience.

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:45.169
A man named Jose was trained in the martial arts and in the use of weapons.

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:53.169
He had broken the law so many times that he was brought to trial on 22 counts and sentenced to 20 years in prison.

00:03:53.169 --> 00:04:01.169
He was so violent that even fellow inmates were afraid of him and he was kept in a high security cell.

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:07.169
For seven years his fleshly sister, who was one of Jehovah's witnesses, visited him.

00:04:08.169 --> 00:04:11.169
But he always rejected the Bible's message.

00:04:11.169 --> 00:04:17.170
In time though, he accepted one of our publications and a Bible study was started.

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:21.170
Right away he made tremendous changes in his conduct.

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:28.170
One week later he gave a personal witness to 200 prisoners and the following week to 600 more.

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:34.170
He even received permission to visit the inmates in other prison blocks.

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:40.170
While due to the remarkable change in his behavior, his sentence was reduced to 15 years.

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:45.170
However, after serving just 10 years he was released from prison.

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:49.170
Jose was eventually baptized as one of Jehovah's witnesses.

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:54.170
Truly a case of the wolf residing with the lamb.

00:04:54.170 --> 00:05:00.170
And what about the future fulfillment of Isaiah 11 verses 6-9?

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:09.170
In the earthly paradise that God has promised, there will be delightful peace among humans and between humans and animals.

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:12.170
Don't you long for that time?

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:18.170
As you watch the following video, notice the peace we enjoy with fellow believers now

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:25.220
and just imagine the peace that we'll enjoy in paradise.

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:33.220
How would you feel during a long journey where you might meet wild animals and criminals along the road?

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:43.560
Jehovah assured the returning exiles that they would return in safety and dwell in peace.

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:59.009
In the spiritual paradise we enjoy right now, people who were once violent have learned to be humble, loving and peaceable.

00:05:59.009 --> 00:06:49.839
Imagine the peace that will reign in God's new world where we can wander this beautiful glows, explore every corner,

00:06:49.839 --> 00:07:09.920
and admire the handy work of the true God with no fear.

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:23.160
They will do no harm nor cause any ruin in all my holy mountain says Jehovah.

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:30.160
As the video showed, people who were once violent have learned to be humble, loving and peaceable.

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:37.160
And how did you feel when you saw scenes in the video of humans so close to wild animals?

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:44.160
Jehovah's promise of peace among humans and peace between humans and animals is thrilling.

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:50.160
Please notice what Isaiah further wrote about this piece at Isaiah chapter 65.

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:53.160
Please turn there with me Isaiah 65.

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:58.160
Now these are words similar to those we read earlier at Isaiah chapter 11.

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:02.470
Isaiah 65 verse 25.

00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:05.470
The wolf and the lamb will feed together.

00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:08.470
The lion will eat straw just like the bull.

00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:11.470
And the serpent's food will be dust.

00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:17.470
They will do no harm nor cause any ruin in all my holy mountain says Jehovah.

00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:25.199
Skilled artists in the art department at world headquarters beautifully illustrate such scenes

00:08:25.199 --> 00:08:28.199
and the images can be found in our publications.

00:08:28.199 --> 00:08:32.200
But what Isaiah describes is no artist's rendition.

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:35.200
This will be real.

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:41.200
Think how you'll feel when you're not afraid of wild animals and the animals aren't afraid of you.

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:50.610
As we look forward to that future promise of peace, what can we do now to pursue peace?

00:08:50.610 --> 00:09:01.610
One thing is to contribute to the peace of our spiritual paradise, the secure, spiritually prosperous environment in which we worship Jehovah.

00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:08.610
Jesus stated at Matthew chapter 5 verse 9, happy are the peacemakers.

00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:13.610
A peacemaker is skilled at restoring peace among brothers when peace is disturbed.

00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:20.610
But more importantly, a peacemaker strives to avoid disturbing peace in the first place.

00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:23.610
Does peacemaker describe you?

00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:27.610
Are you contributing to our spiritual paradise in that way?

00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:35.269
Something else we can do as we await the future fulfillment of the wolf and the lamb feeding together

00:09:35.269 --> 00:09:43.269
is to meditate on what it will be like to help resurrected ones who were violent to become peaceable.

00:09:43.269 --> 00:09:52.269
Imagine studying with a resurrected one who had a violent background, perhaps experiencing a violent death because of a fierce personality.

00:09:52.269 --> 00:09:59.269
How will you reason with the person from God's word to help him see the need to be a peacemaker?

00:09:59.269 --> 00:10:03.269
What examples of such transformations will you share?

00:10:03.269 --> 00:10:12.269
And how will you explain the prophecies of peace at Isaiah chapter 11 verses 6 through 9 and chapter 65 verse 25?

00:10:12.269 --> 00:10:24.159
We encourage all of you to think deeply about how this promise of peace was fulfilled for the ancient Jews, how the promise is being fulfilled today,

00:10:24.159 --> 00:10:28.159
and what life on earth will be like when it's fulfilled in the future.

00:10:29.159 --> 00:10:39.049
May all of us take delight in the peaceful promise of the wolf and the lamb feeding together.

00:10:39.049 --> 00:10:45.049
Where the James Mance, a helper to the writing committee, will now present the next talk of this symposium.

00:10:45.049 --> 00:10:49.049
Take delight in God's promises of peace.

00:10:49.049 --> 00:10:52.049
No resident will say, I am sick.
