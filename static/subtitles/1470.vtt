00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:11.300
In ancient times, when an Israelite made a heartfelt offering to support the temple,

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:21.070
that offering was referred to as a gift in hand to Jehovah.

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.070
Today, in Kingdom Halls of Jehovah's Witnesses around the world,

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.070
there are small boxes marked for voluntary contributions.

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.070
When we give our valuable things, where does it actually go?

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.070
Each year, hundreds of thousands become our new brothers and sisters.

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:46.070
To accommodate our growing numbers, funds are provided to help construct new places of worship,

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.070
as well as branch facilities all over the world.

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.070
One thing that I really appreciate about being here is to see family heads,

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:00.070
fathers and husbands choose to use their vacation time.

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:07.069
So thank you to the families and the congregations that support all of this and us to be here.

00:01:07.069 --> 00:01:13.069
What's just as impressive is seeing millions of brothers and sisters voluntarily give them their funds

00:01:13.069 --> 00:01:15.069
so that we can keep building.

00:01:15.069 --> 00:01:21.409
Just that in itself is an amazing act of Jehovah's Holy Spirit.

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:28.409
Large doors leading to greater activity are being opened by means of theocratic schools.

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:35.409
Training is provided to help those enrolled to develop spiritually and take a zealous lead in the evangelizing work.

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:42.409
When you think of the organization and the education, the divine education that it provides,

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:49.409
there is no government on earth today that educates his citizens like the Kingdom.

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:55.409
It has strengthened into my relationship with Jehovah in ways I never considered before.

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.409
The training is wonderful and motivates spiritual growth.

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:07.409
Voluntary contributions help support the thousands of special full-time servants worldwide.

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.409
These include Bethelites.

00:02:09.409 --> 00:02:15.409
While working in the printer, it's abundantly clear that none of this would happen without Jehovah's support,

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:18.409
shown by what the friends can give.

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:27.409
I love my assignment and serve with the knowledge that my sacrifice wouldn't be possible without the sacrifice of brothers and sisters in the field.

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:36.409
Also included are missionaries traveling overseas, international servants and special pioneers.

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:45.810
All that support makes it possible and makes our assignment a great joy and a privilege something that we look forward to.

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:53.810
Each and every week, each and every month, each and every year that we're able to devote our full-time efforts in preaching the goodness of the Kingdom.

00:02:53.810 --> 00:03:00.810
It allows us to be here so that we can help as many people as possible who do want to learn about Jehovah.

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.810
Every year, we look forward to receiving rich spiritual gems at our conventions.

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:12.810
Funds are provided for equipment and other needs to help everything run as smoothly as possible.

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:19.120
It was a delight this year to see how technology was used to promote the unity.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:26.120
Having the different cities involved were video streaming to them for the key talks by governing body members and their helpers.

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.120
Received tremendous response from those cities.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:38.120
We've seen more people in their seats during the program because they were afraid to get up even for a moment because they might miss something that was special.

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:46.120
When disasters strikes, your donations help give immediate relief for our brothers and sisters in need.

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:53.120
Food, clothing, building materials, and much more are shipped over as quickly as possible.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:58.120
I have come to really appreciate Jehovah's organization.

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:04.120
No other organization can compare in how it provides support in such a loving way.

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:13.120
I know now, you know, like, Jehovah, this look after his people, so I'm really grateful for that and I'd be praying and giving thanks.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:20.120
Yes, all our contributions have a meaningful share in supporting Kingdom Interest worldwide.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:26.120
Each donation is like a gift in hand to our Heavenly Father, Jehovah.

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:35.120
When we give from our heart, we are expressing our love for Him and that is the best gift we can give Him.
