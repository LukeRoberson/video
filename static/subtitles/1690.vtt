00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:07.099
On the subject of punctuality, we wanted to share an example of how ingrained a problem

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:10.460
can become if we let it fester.

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:12.660
Meet Brother Peter Zach.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:19.839
As he relates his story, look for ways punctuality or promptly addressing matters could have

00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:26.859
helped him to minimize the effects of the problem.

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:33.899
I was born in Poland and when I was about five years old, my family immigrated to Canada.

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.579
I feel from a young age, I really loved Jehovah.

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:38.460
I had a good relationship with him.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.299
I enjoyed going in field service.

00:00:40.299 --> 00:00:43.420
I enjoyed the congregation.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:50.740
But like all youths, I had my distractions, you can say, and for me in particular was video

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:51.899
games.

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:57.619
I remember in the beginning, even my parents would set some rules, but as I kept progressing

00:00:57.619 --> 00:01:02.299
in that game and I started participating in tournaments, I started getting recognised.

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:07.739
Admired, it started becoming a temptation.

00:01:07.739 --> 00:01:13.739
People would go to download my previously played games to study my techniques, my strategies.

00:01:13.739 --> 00:01:16.819
I was interviewed by different websites.

00:01:16.819 --> 00:01:18.459
People wanted to be on my team.

00:01:18.459 --> 00:01:23.019
I could see that this world was slowly dragging me in.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.500
For example, there was a huge tournament that I participated in.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.459
I finished very well, received many prizes.

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:35.939
And then after that tournament, there was another tournament, even bigger, with huge prizes,

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.459
cash prizes, competition for all the best players in the world.

00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:42.299
At this time also, the website was growing.

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.819
We were just sponsored to produce our own tournament with cash prizes for the players.

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:51.540
So I really thought that this would be an opportunity for me to maybe have a career,

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.980
maybe to support myself.

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:59.099
So in the future, if I wanted to pioneer, and I thought it was a realistic goal.

00:01:59.099 --> 00:02:04.900
But as the website also kept progressing and I got more involved with it, I realised what

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:11.139
I was exposed to was very, very dangerous, very harmful.

00:02:11.139 --> 00:02:16.460
It was immoral, wicked, improper things.

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.460
I was going in the meetings, I was going in service.

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.060
At the same time, all my other time was spent on this video game.

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.659
But it was only slowly, over time, I started realizing that it was having a very negative

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:29.659
effect on my spiritual team.

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:35.099
I noticed that when I was in service, I would think only about the video.

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:39.020
When the service was over, I would rush home to play the video game.

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.900
Even at meetings, I would attend all my meetings, but I would sit there, and nothing was coming

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:43.900
in.

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:50.740
I went there in person, but my mind wasn't there, so that I also started bothering me.

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:58.099
At this time, my older brothers, who were always a good example to me, they quit playing

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:59.099
games.

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:01.699
They were making improvements in the congregation.

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:06.900
They were having privileges, working hard for the brothers and sisters in that congregation.

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.379
I could see they were so happy.

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:15.539
They had the real joy and satisfaction, but for me, I didn't.

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:17.580
I was always feeling empty inside.

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:18.580
I needed change.

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.419
I remember, in particular, one day at the back of the kingdom hall, the brother and

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:29.500
elder who studied with me and my two brothers, he approached me, and he very reasonably talked

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:34.460
to me about my future.

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:39.060
He also helped me see my brothers and how they stopped, and they were so happy, and I

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.580
could see the difference.

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:51.530
I was serving two masses at the same time, but I was really losing out with Jehovah.

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.330
So I knew I had to make drastic changes in my life.

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:00.569
Up until then, I did try a few times to stop playing video games.

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:03.729
And I worked for a couple of days, but I got right back into it.

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:09.879
I lacked self-control.

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:16.920
So I realized that for me, if I wanted to stop this, I need to make complete stop of everything.

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:18.240
So I prayed about it.

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:23.399
I asked Jehovah for help, for strength, to give me the courage to take this action.

00:04:23.399 --> 00:04:28.759
We took down the website, deleted the games, stopped playing the games, and just made

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:34.519
a clean sweep, clean stop, and I knew I needed that.

00:04:34.519 --> 00:04:41.079
Right after, I felt like a load was lifted.

00:04:41.079 --> 00:04:46.319
I had all this time now I could spend, and I was spending it more in a ministry, in a

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:47.720
congregation.

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:52.399
So soon after, I started auxiliary pioneering, regular pioneering, I started doing a lot

00:04:52.399 --> 00:04:53.759
more in a congregation.

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:59.680
I could see how happy I was, who's bringing me real joy, satisfaction.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:04.600
So I remember after pioneering for a few years, I started learning a foreign language.

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.839
It was challenging, but it was exciting.

00:05:06.839 --> 00:05:10.879
I moved to another city to expand my ministry.

00:05:10.879 --> 00:05:17.319
Then I moved to another country, and I remember just studying with people as a need grader,

00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:22.160
and just seeing them progress, and seeing how they made changes in their lives, and how

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.639
they started having a relationship with Jehovah, and that I was being used to help them

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:33.259
to get to that point, was such an amazing feeling.

00:05:33.259 --> 00:05:38.420
Now I have the privilege of serving in Bethel, and I can see Jehovah's hand in my life, and

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:55.550
also be able to give every day to him.

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:57.870
This is the joy that I was looking for.

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:04.550
So I would definitely encourage all young ones to really test out Jehovah.

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:08.870
Like Ecclesiastes, chapter 12 verse 1, my favorite scripture is growing up, that just

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:14.829
give Jehovah, test them out, give them everything, and you will see you have no regrets.

00:06:14.829 --> 00:06:17.750
You have true satisfaction from serving him.
