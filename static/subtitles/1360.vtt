00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:13.750
Every year, thousands of truck drivers from all over the world

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.750
crisscross the European continent.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.750
They work hard to make ends meet for their families,

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:26.420
but often have to spend weeks away from home.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.420
Jesus and His apostles approach people wherever they were.

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.420
It is the same spirit that must motivate us.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.420
By trying to reach truck drivers, wherever they can be found,

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.420
we can make sure that everyone receives a witness,

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.420
even those who would otherwise be missed.

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.420
We live in a Rotterdam area which has a lot of truck traffic.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.420
We cover our regular territory once every three months,

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.420
while these truck drivers are hardly ever reached.

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.420
We noticed that 300,000 trucks cross France every year.

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:05.420
Thus, it was necessary to explore this formidable potential for the ministry.

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.980
Many truck drivers use truck stops to take a short break

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:12.980
or even spend the night there.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:14.980
That's ideal for preaching.

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.980
While we are parked here resting,

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.980
we are cleaning the truck,

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:27.980
we are washing our clothes,

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:29.980
because there is no laundry here,

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.980
and also we are cooking.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.980
One day, on my way to France,

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:40.980
I had to stop in Austria

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:44.980
to swap drivers.

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:48.980
My colleague went to the bathroom and I was alone.

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:53.980
At that moment, a witness came and offered me a magazine.

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:59.980
Much effort is being put into reaching truck drivers in an organized way.

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.980
We made sure all truck stops were mapped

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:09.979
and organized schedules so that pioneers can preach in this territory at least once a day.

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:17.319
Publishers will encounter many different nationalities and languages.

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:21.319
The language barrier is one of the biggest challenges.

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:24.319
On any given morning, you can encounter up to ten different languages,

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:27.319
Romanian, Russian, Polish.

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:31.319
When I looked at the magazine,

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.319
I saw that it was a watchtower.

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:35.319
But I thought it was in German.

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:39.319
I told this brother that I did not speak German.

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:41.319
Then he had a look at my license plate

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:43.319
and I saw that it was Romanian.

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:46.319
He again offered me the magazine and told me,

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:49.319
it is Romanian, it is for you.

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:52.319
When I saw it, I was very happy.

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:55.319
I took the magazine and was very glad.

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:01.629
Of course, we don't speak in tongues like the first century Christians did,

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:05.629
but JW.org makes us feel like we can preach in any language.

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:13.740
We need to go further than just distributing publications.

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:15.740
We need to be real teachers.

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.740
And to do that, we can make use of the video.

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:27.740
A driver had his Bible wide open on his dashboard

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:30.740
and literally cried when he watched the video.

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:32.740
Why study the Bible?

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.180
Since truck drivers spend most of the time on the road,

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.180
it is a real challenge to follow up on those who have shown any interest.

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.180
It's very difficult to do return visits or to start Bible studies.

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.180
You just don't know when you will meet a truck driver again,

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.180
so we try to get their email addresses as soon as possible.

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.180
The results were remarkable.

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.180
For example, in the last service year,

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.180
around 100,000 magazines were placed.

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.180
100 Bible studies were started,

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.180
and 4,000 videos were shown.

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:22.040
Experience shows that even if it's not possible to obtain an email address,

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:27.610
the slightest witness given can have a great impact.

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.610
In time, I returned to Romania.

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.610
I started a Bible study, progressed spiritually, got married,

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.610
and now I am an unbaptized publisher.

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.610
The brother that first contacted me has no idea.

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:53.240
The more you invest in this form of ministry,

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.240
the more fulfillment you get from the positive response of the driver.

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:03.240
It is a good thing to preach the good news at truck stops.

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.240
Because all drivers need to feel God's love,

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.240
to see that God really cares for us,

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.240
and like me, they can make changes in their lives.

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:22.240
And they need to see that Jehovah has promised a future paradise,

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.240
and how this will affect them and their families.
