00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:11.019
A teacher should always help his or her student to develop love for Jehovah.

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:14.019
That's the best foundation to build on.

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:21.420
For me, it's important that they see Jehovah as a real person.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.420
In order to help them build a good foundation, they need to know that Jehovah gave us the Bible

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.420
so that we can receive his guidance for the future and for eternity.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:36.630
I'm so thankful for my Bible teacher.

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.630
She always helped me see Jehovah's point of view on things from the Bible.

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:47.100
I'll never stop thanking Jehovah for what he's done for me.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:53.100
He drew me to the truth, he gave me a teacher that didn't just teach me about the Bible,

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.100
but by his example, the brother taught me how to really be one of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:06.890
When I started studying, my parents told me that they didn't consider me their daughter anymore.

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:15.650
During the study, my teacher helped me see from the Bible that Jehovah had a lot of really good things in store for me.

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:28.480
My environment was very hostile before.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:35.780
My problem was that my wife and I argued a lot and I had a bad temper.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.780
The brother's advice really helped us to keep calm when we had problems.

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:50.180
When a person starts getting to know Jehovah and they learn and apply Bible truths in their lives,

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.180
the people who were their friends before are going to disappear.

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.180
We need to give them that friendship they're losing.

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:06.049
We've had to make some sacrifices for our students,

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:12.050
but when we think about the blessings, we can barely remember the sacrifices.

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:20.050
I worked full time, but I had to adapt to the student's needs, not the other way around.

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:25.050
Sometimes I'd be up at six o'clock in the morning conducting a Bible study.

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.050
Sometimes things come up and you can't make it,

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.050
but the study should still happen.

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.050
Another brother can study with them if we're not going to be there.

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.050
When someone starts studying, it can feel like a lot.

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.050
The Bible itself has 66 books.

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:48.050
So for example, you can suggest that the student start reading a few verses every day

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.050
and then add a little more every week.

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.050
So that is how we see them progress.

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.050
You get to see them practice what they're learning,

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.050
really following the Bible's counsel in their lives.

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:05.330
We don't just conduct a study, see them progress, get baptized, and then say,

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.330
okay, see you later, it doesn't work like that.

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.469
They become part of our life.

00:03:12.469 --> 00:03:14.469
It's been my friend since before I got baptized.

00:03:14.469 --> 00:03:17.469
It's been about 28 years now.

00:03:18.469 --> 00:03:22.469
Years ago, my former student Abel had a really difficult time.

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:25.469
His wife got sick.

00:03:25.469 --> 00:03:29.469
Although we were far away when we heard about it, we kept in touch with him.

00:03:29.469 --> 00:03:37.509
Thank you Livingstone family for calling Jessica during these hard times.

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:41.180
It's very encouraging to us.

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.180
I know that you love us and we also love you very much.

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:50.180
You are an example in true worship for us.

00:03:50.180 --> 00:04:02.370
May Jehovah continue caring for you and blessing you.

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:09.370
I got baptized 34 years ago and have been pioneering for 33 years.

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.370
My Bible teacher was Shara.

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.370
She was diagnosed with cancer.

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:21.649
When I got sick, Jehovah used Mercedes to help me.

00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:28.649
After all this time, since I helped her learn the truth, now she comforts me.

00:04:28.649 --> 00:04:31.649
To father-son relationship.

00:04:31.649 --> 00:04:35.649
At some point, maybe this student will help me.

00:04:35.649 --> 00:04:41.649
And we can say that we are good for nothing slaves and we have done what we ought to have done.

00:04:41.649 --> 00:04:45.649
And they keep loving and serving Jehovah. What's better than that?
