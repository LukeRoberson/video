00:00:01.419 --> 00:00:07.419
I have been suffering from a very rare type of cancer since I was eight years old.

00:00:07.419 --> 00:00:11.419
I have a tumor growing along my spine next to my heart.

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:15.419
It causes heart problems and very violent back pains.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.420
I begged Jehovah not to fall apart.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.420
I was going to break down.

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:28.420
And before I'd even finished my prayer, I felt a veil of peace and serenity envelop me.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:34.420
Jehovah was holding my hand. I could almost feel him saying, I'm with you.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:43.420
Experiencing such extreme trials allowed me really to taste Jehovah's undeserved kindness.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.420
And that's wonderful.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.420
There are a lot of things I'd like to do, but I am unable to because of my sickness.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.340
I've had many feelings since my childhood.

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.340
Frustration, anger, even denial.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.340
But Jehovah really helped me accept my situation.

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:13.549
My parents always taught me to cherish my relationship with Jehovah.

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:18.549
Today, I just need to know that Jehovah loves me.

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:23.549
When I don't feel well, I pray to him very intensely for very precise things.

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.549
Each time he answers my prayer.

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:31.549
Mateo started to pioneer when he was 14.

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:37.549
We, his parents, along with his brother, his sister and his friends thought.

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:43.549
If Mateo, who has cancer, can be a regular pioneer, then we should also do it.

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:49.549
Today, the most precious blessing is to see that Jehovah is always there for me constantly.

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:52.549
And I know he will never let me down.

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:56.549
His undeserved kindness is sufficient for me.
