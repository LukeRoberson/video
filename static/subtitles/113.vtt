WEBVTT

00:00:01.649 --> 00:00:05.650
Welcome, everybody, to J.W. Broadcasting.

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:08.650
My co-host is brother Isaac Morelle,

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:11.650
and his given name is Isaac, but we all call him Socky.

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:13.650
I'm so glad to see you, Socky,

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.649
because we've got a lot of work today.

00:00:16.649 --> 00:00:19.649
But first, you have quite an interesting background in the truth.

00:00:19.649 --> 00:00:21.649
Why don't you tell us something about it?

00:00:21.649 --> 00:00:24.649
Thank you. I'll be happy to do so.

00:00:24.649 --> 00:00:28.649
I was born in South Africa in a very small town

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:31.649
called Blaifur Hsich.

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:34.649
My father was not one of Jova's witnesses.

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.649
He initially opposed my mother,

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:39.649
who was a dedicated servant of Jehovah,

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:43.649
but later changed and was very supportive.

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:49.649
My mother served Jehovah faithfully until her death in 2017.

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.649
My grandfather, and great-grandfather on my mother's side,

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:58.649
came into the truth in the early 1920s,

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.649
simply by reading a tract.

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.649
When I was about 10 years old,

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:07.650
I read the book, What is Religion Done for Mankind?

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.650
And I was convinced that my mother had the truth.

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.650
My two brothers and three sisters also embraced the truth

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.650
at an early age.

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.650
And to this day, all of them served Jehovah faithfully

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.650
in various parts of the earth.

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.650
While I was in my final year at school,

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.650
I was invited to come to Bethel.

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:40.650
And I started Bethel's service in January 1965 in South Africa.

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.650
Bethel was located in Ilans, Fontaine,

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.650
not far from Johannesburg.

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:51.650
The Bethel family had only 55 members then.

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.650
I had no particular skill, education, or training

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.650
when I came to Bethel.

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.650
Two older brothers in the small family, Andrew Jack,

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.650
from Scotland, and Hertnell from South Africa,

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.650
took me under their wing,

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:12.650
because they knew I had so much to learn.

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.650
They taught me how to apply Bible principles

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.650
in the school of life,

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.650
as outlined in Proverbs 1 verses 1 through 7.

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.650
Andrew Jack taught me how to work,

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.650
and reminded me always to glorify Jehovah.

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.650
Hertnell, an African translator since 1947,

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:42.650
taught me how to reason on scriptural principles.

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.650
Both of them finished the earthly course long ago,

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.650
but their example of loyalty still has deep impact

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.650
on the loyal servants of Jehovah in Southern Africa.

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.900
I had several assignments over the years

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.900
in translation, and in the printery,

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.900
and I worked mostly in cleaning assignments.

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.900
In 1976, I married Jean,

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.900
who served as a pioneer in Durban.

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.900
She was born in Malawi, but she grew up in South Africa.

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.900
She said a great example for me,

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.900
by working diligently at every assignment that she was given.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.900
She always has a good attitude,

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.900
and works as to Jehovah and not to men.

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.900
Very good.

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.900
After serving at the South Africa branch for a few years,

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.900
we were transferred to the United States Bethel in 1981.

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.900
We've served in Walkill, Brooklyn, Patterson,

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.900
and are now serving in Walwick.

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.900
Well, thanks for sharing.

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.900
I know I've been built up by hearing your experience,

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.900
and I'm sure the friends feel the same way.

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.900
Why don't you give us the highlights

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.900
of what we can expect during the program?

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.900
I'll be glad to, David.

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.900
As this system nears its end,

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:13.900
we may at times feel trapped and helpless.

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:19.899
How can we be sure that Jehovah is still helping us?

00:04:19.899 --> 00:04:23.899
Many years ago, Karen found joy and fulfillment

00:04:23.899 --> 00:04:26.899
with her spiritual family,

00:04:26.899 --> 00:04:30.899
but her life-serving Jehovah hasn't been easy.

00:04:30.899 --> 00:04:32.899
We'll see how she's doing

00:04:32.899 --> 00:04:35.899
in the next episode of the series.

00:04:35.899 --> 00:04:39.209
Where are they now?

00:04:39.209 --> 00:04:42.209
Have you ever wished that you could have more conversations

00:04:42.209 --> 00:04:44.209
in the ministry?

00:04:44.209 --> 00:04:48.209
Our latest episode of Iron Chopin's Iron

00:04:48.209 --> 00:04:52.209
provides suggestions for doing so.

00:04:52.209 --> 00:04:59.209
This is the April 2024 edition of J.W. Broadcasting.

00:04:59.209 --> 00:05:22.790
An outstanding fact is recorded at Isaiah 55,

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:26.790
10 and 11.

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:30.790
For just as the rain and the snow pour down from heaven,

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:34.790
and do not return there until they saturate the earth,

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:36.790
making it produce and sprout,

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:40.790
giving seed to the sower and bread to the eater.

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:42.790
Now notice this.

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:49.790
So my word, my word that goes out of my mouth will be.

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:53.790
It will not return to me without results,

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:58.790
but it will certainly accomplish whatever is my delight.

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:02.790
The word of God is the statement of His purpose.

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:07.790
Now, it can be delivered orally or in writing.

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:11.790
We call the Bible God's written word and rightly so.

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:14.790
But long before writing was invented,

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:17.790
Jehovah expresses purpose in words.

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:20.790
And God said, let there be light.

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:23.790
And there was light.

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:26.790
Through Isaiah, Jehovah is telling us that

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:29.790
He will always accomplish His purpose.

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:31.790
So no matter how powerful,

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:34.790
fighters against that purpose seem to be,

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:37.790
they will always lose in the end.

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:39.790
Remembering that will help us

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:42.790
when we're faced with a poser so seem unbeatable.

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:45.790
So I thought we might consider some Bible examples

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:48.790
that illustrate the point.

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:51.790
Take the days of King Saul, for example.

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:55.790
Now, Jehovah sent Samuel to anoint the next king of Israel.

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:58.790
And as recorded at 1 Samuel 161,

00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:00.790
God said to Samuel,

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:04.790
I will send you to Jesse, the Bethlehemite,

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:09.790
because I have selected from among His sons a king for myself.

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:12.790
Saul's replacement turned out to be David.

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:14.790
He was Jehovah's choice.

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:17.790
At some point, Saul himself understood that.

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:20.790
In fact, according to 1 Samuel 2317,

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:23.790
his son Jonathan said to David,

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:26.790
you will be king over Israel.

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:32.790
And my father Saul also knows that.

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:36.790
Confirming this, on one occasion Saul said to David,

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:40.790
I know that you will surely rule as king.

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:41.790
It's quite of it all.

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:43.790
Saul tried to kill David,

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:46.790
and he had the support of a powerful army.

00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:50.790
Saul himself was apparently a very strong man.

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:54.790
Still, it was God's will for David to become king,

00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:57.790
and Saul knew it.

00:07:57.790 --> 00:07:59.790
So we ask,

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:02.790
why did Saul keep on fighting?

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:05.790
And whom was he fighting really?

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:07.790
Not just David.

00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:10.790
He was fighting against God.

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:14.790
Saul was setting himself up for failure.

00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:17.790
No doubt Satan was egging Saul on.

00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:22.790
If Satan could cause just one of Jehovah's promises to fail.

00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:24.790
But in the end,

00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:26.790
the word of God prevailed.

00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:28.790
David became king.

00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:34.870
Well, who would replace David when the time came?

00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:38.870
That was also Jehovah's decision to make, and he made it.

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:41.870
According to First Chronicles 22, 9 and 10,

00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:42.870
Jehovah told David,

00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:45.870
look, you will have a son.

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:47.870
Solomon will be his name.

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:50.870
And I will firmly establish the throne of his kingship

00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:53.870
over Israel forever.

00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:57.870
So Solomon would be the next king of Israel.

00:08:57.870 --> 00:09:00.870
Who could prevent that from happening?

00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:03.870
David's son, Adonajah tried,

00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:05.870
and failed.

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:06.870
Why?

00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:08.870
As quoted at First Kings 215,

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:10.870
and he later admitted,

00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:13.870
the kingship eluded me and became my brothers,

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:17.870
for it was from Jehovah that it became his.

00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:21.870
If Adonajah thought he could outmaneuver Jehovah,

00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:24.870
he was sadly mistaken.

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:27.870
Jehovah promised the Israelites that he would give them

00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:30.870
the land of Canaan as an inheritance.

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:32.870
The Canaanites had other ideas.

00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:35.870
They'd heard of Jehovah's powerful works in Egypt,

00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:37.870
but they fought against him anyway.

00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:39.870
They learned.

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:41.870
They learned at their cost,

00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:46.870
but fighters against God always lose.

00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:50.870
Now, if you were asked to name some prominent fighters against God

00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:51.870
in Jesus' day,

00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:54.870
you might think of King Herod the Great,

00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:57.870
the Jewish high priest, Kayathus,

00:09:57.870 --> 00:10:00.870
and maybe the Roman governor, Pontius Pilate.

00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:03.870
Let's talk about them.

00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:05.870
First, Herod the Great.

00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:11.870
Let's read Matthew chapter 2, verses 1 and 2.

00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:15.870
Now astrologers visit King Herod,

00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:18.870
and they ask a strange question.

00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:20.870
We read,

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:23.870
after Jesus had been born in Bethlehem of Judea,

00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:25.870
in the days of Herod the King.

00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:29.870
Look, astrologers from the east came to Jerusalem,

00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:30.870
saying,

00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:34.870
where is the one born king of the Jews?

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:36.870
King of the Jews?

00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:39.870
For we saw his star when we were in the east,

00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:43.870
and we have come to do obeisance to him.

00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:46.870
Did you notice something strange here?

00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:49.870
No angel had spoken to those astrologers.

00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:51.870
Yet when the men saw light in heaven,

00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:55.870
they concluded that it signaled the birth of the King of the Jews.

00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:57.870
That's a stretch.

00:10:57.870 --> 00:11:00.870
Who do you suppose put that idea in their head?

00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:03.870
And who do you suppose gave them the bright idea

00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:08.870
to ask the present king of Israel about his future rival?

00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:11.870
That has taken the devil written all over it, doesn't it?

00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:15.870
Now, notice verses 3 and 4.

00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:17.870
At hearing this,

00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:21.870
King Herod was agitated and all Jerusalem with him,

00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:25.870
on gathering together all the chief priests and scribes of the people.

00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:31.870
He inquired of them where the Christ was to be born.

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:33.870
Interesting.

00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:37.870
Herod doesn't just ask where the future king of the Jews will be born.

00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:41.870
He asks where the Christ will be born.

00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:44.870
Now, as a Jewish proselyt,

00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:47.870
he's supposed to be waiting for the Christ, the Messiah.

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:50.870
Yet, now that the Messiah has come,

00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:52.870
Herod wants to kill him.

00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:56.870
Herod is fighting against God.

00:11:56.870 --> 00:11:58.870
Does he win?

00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:01.870
No. Jesus escapes his clutches.

00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:04.870
And a few months later, Herod himself dies.

00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:07.870
Few mourn his death.

00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:13.309
In Jesus' day, the Jewish high priests were appointed

00:12:13.309 --> 00:12:16.309
and removed by the Romans.

00:12:16.309 --> 00:12:19.309
Now, high priest Kaphos was a skilled politician.

00:12:19.309 --> 00:12:22.309
He knew how to please the Romans.

00:12:22.309 --> 00:12:26.309
And because of that, he hung onto his job a lot longer than many others.

00:12:26.309 --> 00:12:31.309
And he had a powerful supporter, Pontius Pilate.

00:12:31.309 --> 00:12:36.309
With his connections, Kaphos seemed untouchable.

00:12:36.309 --> 00:12:39.309
Pilate himself was very well connected.

00:12:39.309 --> 00:12:42.309
He had a good friend in high places in Rome.

00:12:42.309 --> 00:12:45.309
Pontius, Sajanus.

00:12:45.309 --> 00:12:48.309
Now, maybe you've never heard of Sajanus before.

00:12:48.309 --> 00:12:52.309
But he was probably the most powerful man in the Roman Empire.

00:12:52.309 --> 00:12:56.309
The emperor left most of the major decisions to Sajanus.

00:12:56.309 --> 00:13:00.309
Now, he made many enemies, but they were powerless against him.

00:13:00.309 --> 00:13:02.309
Until?

00:13:02.309 --> 00:13:06.309
Until the fall of 31 CE.

00:13:06.309 --> 00:13:10.309
At that time, Sajanus got on the wrong side of the emperor

00:13:10.309 --> 00:13:13.309
and was put to death.

00:13:13.309 --> 00:13:21.309
After that, the emperor commanded that anyone who had been friends with Sajanus

00:13:21.309 --> 00:13:24.309
was to be executed.

00:13:24.309 --> 00:13:27.309
How do you think Pilate felt?

00:13:27.309 --> 00:13:29.309
He must have been a nervous wreck.

00:13:29.309 --> 00:13:33.309
As we said, he and Sajanus had been very close.

00:13:33.309 --> 00:13:38.309
And now, a year and a half after Sajanus was executed,

00:13:39.309 --> 00:13:42.309
what do you suppose Pilate was thinking?

00:13:42.309 --> 00:13:44.309
When the Jewish rulers cried out,

00:13:44.309 --> 00:13:50.309
if you release Jesus, you are no friend of Caesar.

00:13:50.309 --> 00:13:56.309
Some scholars believe that this was a factor in Pilate's decision to order Jesus' execution

00:13:56.309 --> 00:13:59.309
to protect his own job.

00:13:59.309 --> 00:14:01.309
Did he protect it?

00:14:01.309 --> 00:14:02.309
No.

00:14:02.309 --> 00:14:05.309
Pilate wasn't immediately struck by lightning,

00:14:05.309 --> 00:14:08.309
but less than four years after he sentenced Jesus to death,

00:14:08.309 --> 00:14:12.309
he got into big trouble and was recalled to Rome.

00:14:12.309 --> 00:14:15.309
With no powerful friend to defend him,

00:14:15.309 --> 00:14:18.309
Pilate was removed as Roman governor.

00:14:18.309 --> 00:14:21.309
What happened next isn't clear.

00:14:21.309 --> 00:14:26.309
Some say Pilate committed suicide, others say he was banished.

00:14:26.309 --> 00:14:30.309
Whatever happened, it wasn't good.

00:14:31.309 --> 00:14:33.309
When Pilate lost his job,

00:14:33.309 --> 00:14:35.309
Kephas lost his protector,

00:14:35.309 --> 00:14:38.309
and soon he was removed as high priest.

00:14:38.309 --> 00:14:41.309
Thus, two fighters against God,

00:14:41.309 --> 00:14:44.309
Pilate and Kephas were dispatched,

00:14:44.309 --> 00:14:49.230
soon after they committed their greatest crime.

00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:53.230
We certainly don't want to be fighters against Jehovah God.

00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:56.230
How can we cooperate with this purpose today?

00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:59.230
Consider this scenario.

00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:02.230
A brother offends you.

00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:04.230
Says something thoughtless.

00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:06.230
You're hurt.

00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:09.230
Now how does Jehovah view that person?

00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:11.230
He's God's friend.

00:15:11.230 --> 00:15:13.230
Jehovah loves his friends.

00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:15.230
He wants you to love them too.

00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:20.230
And what's God's purpose for the brother who offended you?

00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:23.230
He wants him to enjoy life forever.

00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:28.230
Now, how can you work along with Jehovah's purpose?

00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:31.230
If you can just overlook the offense,

00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:33.230
Jehovah will appreciate that.

00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:35.230
But if you can't overlook it,

00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:40.230
Jehovah would want you to approach the person in a kind, respectful way.

00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:42.230
You might say something like this.

00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:44.230
Maybe I'm being too sensitive,

00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:47.230
but I was hurt by what you said the other day.

00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:49.230
No, I know you didn't mean to hurt me,

00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:52.230
but I thought I'd let you know how I felt.

00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:54.230
If the person responds favorably,

00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:56.230
and unity is restored,

00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:59.230
then you imagine how pleased Jehovah will be.

00:15:59.230 --> 00:16:02.580
In Matthew chapter 18,

00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:05.580
Jesus gave the illustration of the lost sheep.

00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:07.580
A man had a hundred sheep.

00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:09.580
One got lost.

00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:11.580
The shepherd left the ninety-nine in the field

00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:14.580
and went to great lengths to find the sheep that had strayed

00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:17.580
and bring it back to the fold.

00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:21.580
Is it a coincidence that right after telling that story,

00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:24.580
Jesus outlined three steps we should follow

00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:27.580
when someone has sinned seriously against us.

00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:29.580
At Matthew 18, 15,

00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:33.580
Jesus tells us what our goal should be when we follow those steps.

00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:35.580
Let's read that.

00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:38.580
Moreover, if your brother commits a sin,

00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:42.580
go and reveal his fault between you and him alone.

00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:44.580
If he listens to you,

00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:49.580
notice you have gained your brother.

00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:51.580
The brother who sinned against us

00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:54.580
may be like that lost sheep.

00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:56.580
What should be our goal?

00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:59.580
To gain our brother, not to expose him,

00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:01.580
not to get revenge, not to prove him wrong,

00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:05.579
not to shame him, but to get him back.

00:17:05.579 --> 00:17:07.579
Like that loving shepherd,

00:17:07.579 --> 00:17:09.579
we're willing to go to great lengths

00:17:09.579 --> 00:17:13.579
to bring that airing brother back to the fold.

00:17:13.579 --> 00:17:16.579
Of course, if the brother is an unrepentant sinner,

00:17:16.579 --> 00:17:19.579
the elders will follow the third step outlined by Jesus,

00:17:19.579 --> 00:17:22.579
and he'll be removed from the congregation.

00:17:22.579 --> 00:17:28.339
How else can we work along with Jehovah's purpose?

00:17:28.339 --> 00:17:31.339
We can do that by being involved in the preaching work.

00:17:31.339 --> 00:17:33.339
The Word has gone out.

00:17:33.339 --> 00:17:35.339
This good news of the kingdom must be preached

00:17:35.339 --> 00:17:38.339
in all the inhabited earth.

00:17:38.339 --> 00:17:42.339
Many have tried to prevent that from happening.

00:17:42.339 --> 00:17:44.339
In the early 20th century,

00:17:44.339 --> 00:17:47.339
a few prominent brothers opposed the organization's efforts

00:17:47.339 --> 00:17:50.339
to get everyone involved in the preaching work.

00:17:50.339 --> 00:17:53.339
Those dignitaries were quite happy to get all dressed up

00:17:53.339 --> 00:17:56.339
and give public talks to large audiences,

00:17:56.339 --> 00:17:59.339
but they refused to lower themselves

00:17:59.339 --> 00:18:02.339
to go from house to house.

00:18:02.339 --> 00:18:05.339
They were fighting against God,

00:18:05.339 --> 00:18:09.339
and the angels soon sifted them out.

00:18:09.339 --> 00:18:13.619
Most of them were never heard of again.

00:18:13.619 --> 00:18:16.619
Even in countries where there's a measure of religious freedom,

00:18:16.619 --> 00:18:18.619
fighters against God have tried to prevent us

00:18:18.619 --> 00:18:20.619
from carrying out our commission.

00:18:20.619 --> 00:18:23.619
You need a permit to go from house to house.

00:18:23.619 --> 00:18:25.619
You can't offer magazines on the street.

00:18:25.619 --> 00:18:28.619
You people are a dangerous sect.

00:18:28.619 --> 00:18:32.619
They've even enacted laws directed at stopping our work.

00:18:32.619 --> 00:18:35.619
Unless they change their ways,

00:18:35.619 --> 00:18:39.619
those lawmakers are going to be in big trouble.

00:18:39.619 --> 00:18:41.619
The Word has gone out.

00:18:41.619 --> 00:18:44.619
As you go, preach.

00:18:44.619 --> 00:18:46.619
That great work will be accomplished

00:18:46.619 --> 00:18:49.619
with their support or in spite of them.

00:18:52.089 --> 00:18:54.089
Well, as we've mentioned,

00:18:54.089 --> 00:18:56.089
fighters against God sometimes seem to get away

00:18:56.089 --> 00:18:58.089
with the acts of rebellion,

00:18:58.089 --> 00:19:01.089
but they're on a slippery slope.

00:19:01.089 --> 00:19:04.089
I can't express it better than David did

00:19:04.089 --> 00:19:07.089
in Psalm 37, 1 and 2.

00:19:07.089 --> 00:19:10.089
Do not be upset because of evil men

00:19:10.089 --> 00:19:12.089
or envious of wrongdoers.

00:19:12.089 --> 00:19:15.089
They will quickly weather like grass

00:19:15.089 --> 00:19:18.089
and shrivel like green new grass.

00:19:18.089 --> 00:19:21.089
So, when you hear about powerful opposers

00:19:21.089 --> 00:19:23.089
who seem to be untouchable,

00:19:23.089 --> 00:19:25.089
remember what we've discussed.

00:19:25.089 --> 00:19:28.089
These men may seem to prosper for a while,

00:19:28.089 --> 00:19:31.089
but since they're fighting against God,

00:19:31.089 --> 00:19:34.089
they're more to be pitted than to be feared.

00:19:34.089 --> 00:19:37.089
They're on the wrong side.

00:19:37.089 --> 00:19:41.089
They are fighting a losing battle.

00:19:41.089 --> 00:19:45.089
Thank you, Brothers Plain, for your encouraging discussion.

00:19:45.089 --> 00:19:49.089
Fighters against God always lose.

00:19:49.089 --> 00:19:54.089
How reassuring that is to all of us.

00:19:54.089 --> 00:19:56.089
Trusting Jehovah when faced

00:19:56.089 --> 00:20:00.089
with one problem after another is not easy,

00:20:00.089 --> 00:20:02.089
but it can refine us.

00:20:02.089 --> 00:20:04.089
Please listen,

00:20:04.089 --> 00:20:07.089
as Sister Seagrid did tofully explain

00:20:07.089 --> 00:20:10.089
how she learned this lesson.

00:20:10.089 --> 00:20:20.299
World War II was going on.

00:20:21.299 --> 00:20:25.630
Getting worse and worse,

00:20:25.630 --> 00:20:28.630
we got the evacuation notice

00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:30.630
and we had to leave.

00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:38.400
People did terrible things to people.

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:44.369
They were afraid.

00:20:44.369 --> 00:20:46.369
No matter where you looked,

00:20:46.369 --> 00:20:50.369
there were worldly possessions, material things.

00:20:50.369 --> 00:20:53.369
And everybody threw more things

00:20:53.369 --> 00:20:55.369
and nobody picked anything up.

00:20:55.369 --> 00:20:59.130
But they cared where things

00:20:59.130 --> 00:21:03.130
said would save their life at the moment, something to eat.

00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:10.750
I really didn't know how I would spend my life at that time, right?

00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:15.750
But I knew that I would not use it to get rich,

00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:17.750
to work and work for what?

00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:23.700
I wasn't dedicated to Jehovah at that time.

00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:27.700
Even so, I knew Jehovah wasn't reprieved to him.

00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:33.099
And I'm sure he helped us.

00:21:33.099 --> 00:21:36.099
In 1946, we found out my father was alive

00:21:36.099 --> 00:21:38.099
and my sister was alive.

00:21:38.099 --> 00:21:42.099
We were very privileged to be united as a family.

00:21:42.099 --> 00:21:44.099
And at that time,

00:21:44.099 --> 00:21:47.099
my father was near Berlin.

00:21:47.099 --> 00:21:51.099
And so he started all over again.

00:21:51.099 --> 00:21:53.099
My father, he found a book,

00:21:53.099 --> 00:21:54.099
The Heart of God,

00:21:54.099 --> 00:21:56.099
and started to study the Bible

00:21:56.099 --> 00:21:59.099
with my sister and with myself.

00:21:59.099 --> 00:22:01.099
And little by little,

00:22:01.099 --> 00:22:04.099
he started a congregation at our house.

00:22:04.099 --> 00:22:09.210
Now, coming to know Jehovah,

00:22:09.210 --> 00:22:11.210
learning about the paradise,

00:22:11.210 --> 00:22:14.210
I wanted to tell people about it.

00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:17.210
I knew I would have a purpose in life.

00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:21.099
I heard about Gilead,

00:22:21.099 --> 00:22:24.099
and he said, oh boy, that's where I want to go.

00:22:24.099 --> 00:22:26.099
I wanted to be a missionary.

00:22:26.099 --> 00:22:28.099
I tell the people about the paradise.

00:22:28.099 --> 00:22:33.940
The official ban on the waitresses

00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:37.940
in the eastern zone of Germany came 1950.

00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:39.940
But months before,

00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:42.940
we were already being observed.

00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:47.940
My father got literature for the congregation.

00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:50.940
Many times he would send me on a bicycle

00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:53.940
through the forest with a literature.

00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:57.940
So it's interesting when you're in that situation.

00:22:57.940 --> 00:22:59.940
You might go to prison.

00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:01.940
You just don't worry about it.

00:23:01.940 --> 00:23:03.940
You trust in Jehovah.

00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:05.940
And you just go ahead.

00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:11.410
And that's what our family did.

00:23:11.410 --> 00:23:13.410
Then my father went to the branch

00:23:13.410 --> 00:23:15.410
and they told him,

00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:17.410
Max, there's an assembly in Berlin.

00:23:17.410 --> 00:23:19.410
And if you come,

00:23:19.410 --> 00:23:21.410
don't bring a Bible,

00:23:21.410 --> 00:23:22.410
don't bring a songbook,

00:23:22.410 --> 00:23:23.410
bring nothing.

00:23:23.410 --> 00:23:25.410
So, when my father came back

00:23:25.410 --> 00:23:26.410
from that meeting,

00:23:26.410 --> 00:23:27.410
he told us,

00:23:27.410 --> 00:23:28.410
and he said, well,

00:23:28.410 --> 00:23:30.410
if we go,

00:23:30.410 --> 00:23:35.140
it looks like we can't come back.

00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:37.140
So I said, I'm going.

00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:39.140
And my mother said, I'm going.

00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:41.140
So we all made up our mind.

00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:42.140
We would go.

00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:44.140
That means we would get prepared

00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:46.140
to leave everything again, right?

00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:48.140
So I just put one dress

00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:49.140
on top of the other,

00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:51.140
took the bicycle and I'll be right.

00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:57.140
Shortly after we left,

00:23:57.140 --> 00:23:59.140
a police car came

00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:01.140
and they looked for us.

00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:10.000
It was a special arrangement

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.000
and privilege to be

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.000
at a convention in Berlin.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.000
So we all thanked Jehovah

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.000
that we were there to listen to

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:19.000
and be strengthened

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.000
that spiritual food.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:26.230
And after the convention,

00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:31.230
we were recognized as refugees.

00:24:31.230 --> 00:24:33.230
Got out on a plane

00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:35.230
to West Germany.

00:24:35.230 --> 00:24:37.230
My father said, well,

00:24:37.230 --> 00:24:39.230
now here, for the second time,

00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:41.230
we lost all the material things

00:24:41.230 --> 00:24:43.230
we had in Germany here.

00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:45.230
So we better immigrate

00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:46.230
to the United States

00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:47.230
where my sister was,

00:24:47.230 --> 00:24:49.230
that we all would be together.

00:24:49.230 --> 00:24:50.230
And I said, good,

00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:52.230
I get close to Gilead.

00:24:52.230 --> 00:24:56.730
And then I was privileged

00:24:56.730 --> 00:25:00.730
to attend the 29th class of Gilead.

00:25:00.730 --> 00:25:04.730
And my assignment was Brazil.

00:25:04.730 --> 00:25:07.730
And it was like paradise.

00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:11.579
And there,

00:25:11.579 --> 00:25:12.579
I met my husband

00:25:12.579 --> 00:25:14.579
who was my circuit overseer.

00:25:14.579 --> 00:25:17.829
And so I was privileged

00:25:17.829 --> 00:25:18.829
to travel with him.

00:25:18.829 --> 00:25:21.829
That was a great, great blessing.

00:25:21.829 --> 00:25:28.099
All money can pay for the blessings I have.

00:25:28.099 --> 00:25:33.019
Life is the most important thing there is

00:25:33.019 --> 00:25:35.019
because no matter how much you have,

00:25:35.019 --> 00:25:38.019
you can't prolong your life.

00:25:38.019 --> 00:25:40.019
And then learning about Jehovah

00:25:40.019 --> 00:25:41.019
who gave his son

00:25:41.019 --> 00:25:44.019
to safest from all those terrible things.

00:25:44.019 --> 00:25:47.019
Why wouldn't you use your life

00:25:47.019 --> 00:25:48.019
to serve him?

00:25:48.019 --> 00:25:53.670
Trust in Jehovah.

00:25:53.670 --> 00:25:55.670
And do what you can do

00:25:55.670 --> 00:25:57.670
to serve him from your heart.

00:25:57.670 --> 00:26:02.369
He will never leave you.

00:26:02.369 --> 00:26:04.369
Sister De Toffoli's story

00:26:04.369 --> 00:26:07.369
is not unlike what many of our brothers

00:26:07.369 --> 00:26:10.369
are going through right now.

00:26:10.369 --> 00:26:12.369
The following dramatization

00:26:12.369 --> 00:26:15.369
is based on the real life experiences

00:26:15.369 --> 00:26:17.369
of some of our brothers.

00:26:17.369 --> 00:26:19.369
It's been three days

00:26:19.369 --> 00:26:23.369
since the bomb started to fall.

00:26:23.369 --> 00:26:27.380
When the fighting got closer,

00:26:27.380 --> 00:26:29.380
we hit.

00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:32.380
But I'm not sure how much longer we can stay here.

00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:36.589
Some in the congregation

00:26:36.589 --> 00:26:38.589
plan to leave the country.

00:26:38.589 --> 00:26:40.589
Mother says we'll try to

00:26:40.589 --> 00:26:42.589
when the shelling comes down.

00:26:42.589 --> 00:26:45.589
But it feels like it may never stop.

00:26:45.589 --> 00:26:48.589
Jehovah, can you still see us?

00:26:48.589 --> 00:26:51.589
Luda, you can finish this.

00:26:51.589 --> 00:26:57.559
We have a little more.

00:26:57.559 --> 00:26:59.559
Always writing like your father.

00:26:59.559 --> 00:27:01.559
Thank you, Grandma.

00:27:01.559 --> 00:27:10.799
You're worried about our brothers and sisters.

00:27:11.799 --> 00:27:14.799
Do you remember the day's text?

00:27:14.799 --> 00:27:16.799
No weapon formed against you

00:27:16.799 --> 00:27:18.799
will have any success.

00:27:18.799 --> 00:27:22.049
That's right.

00:27:22.049 --> 00:27:24.049
When we were under ban,

00:27:24.049 --> 00:27:28.049
Satan did everything to break our faith

00:27:28.049 --> 00:27:30.049
for decades.

00:27:30.049 --> 00:27:32.049
But he couldn't stop us preaching.

00:27:32.049 --> 00:27:35.650
You know why?

00:27:35.650 --> 00:27:36.650
No.

00:27:36.650 --> 00:27:38.650
Nothing can take Jehovah's law

00:27:38.650 --> 00:27:40.650
away from his people.

00:27:40.650 --> 00:27:42.650
They tried.

00:27:42.650 --> 00:27:46.990
But we just threw closer to him.

00:27:46.990 --> 00:27:49.990
Jehovah cared for us then.

00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:51.990
And he still does.

00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:54.990
Even if we lose our lives,

00:27:54.990 --> 00:27:57.990
that weapon will have no success

00:27:57.990 --> 00:28:11.700
because of the resurrection.

00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:14.700
Luda, it's time.

00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:17.700
We have to go now.

00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:27.750
It took forever to get to the station.

00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:30.750
One by one, trains left the city.

00:28:30.750 --> 00:28:35.160
There were so many people.

00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:38.160
So much fear.

00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:40.160
Many of the brothers were arrested

00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:42.160
because they would not fight.

00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:44.160
But a few were with us.

00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:46.160
The soldier will need to see your IDs.

00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:50.109
Let's make a line.

00:28:50.109 --> 00:28:53.109
Hours felt like days.

00:28:53.109 --> 00:28:55.109
I didn't know if we would get on.

00:28:55.109 --> 00:29:10.230
There's no more room from you back

00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:20.529
to the shelter now.

00:29:20.529 --> 00:29:22.529
We can try again tomorrow.

00:29:23.529 --> 00:29:38.849
Luda, Jehovah will care for us.

00:29:38.849 --> 00:29:41.849
This is just a delay, not a defeat.

00:29:41.849 --> 00:29:47.049
Come, please.

00:29:47.049 --> 00:29:49.049
I'll have to go check on the others.

00:29:49.049 --> 00:30:08.589
But I'll text you the moment we know more.

00:30:08.589 --> 00:30:11.589
What are you thinking about?

00:30:11.589 --> 00:30:14.589
I wish Papa were here with us.

00:30:14.589 --> 00:30:17.589
I know you do.

00:30:17.589 --> 00:30:20.589
Your father knew you so well.

00:30:20.589 --> 00:30:24.579
I miss them too.

00:30:24.579 --> 00:30:27.859
What hurts?

00:30:27.859 --> 00:30:29.859
I think of Jehovah's special promise

00:30:29.859 --> 00:30:32.859
to care for us.

00:30:32.859 --> 00:30:36.549
Do you remember?

00:30:36.549 --> 00:30:39.549
Yes.

00:30:39.549 --> 00:30:42.549
Psalms 68.5.

00:30:42.549 --> 00:30:47.630
A father of the fatherless.

00:30:47.630 --> 00:30:51.259
I want to trust him.

00:30:51.259 --> 00:30:56.750
You can.

00:30:56.750 --> 00:30:58.750
The trains have stopped.

00:30:58.750 --> 00:31:00.750
Sheldon destroyed some of the tracks.

00:31:00.750 --> 00:31:02.750
What?

00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:03.750
Are we trapped?

00:31:03.750 --> 00:31:09.880
Don't worry, dear.

00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:11.880
But we just know we are here.

00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:14.880
Jehovah won't forget us.

00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:16.880
Let's pray.

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:31.640
We're here.

00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:34.640
We're over here.

00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:36.640
I'm sorry, it took so long.

00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:38.640
Did you hear about the trains?

00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:41.640
Don't worry. There is good news.

00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:45.460
We couldn't leave.

00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:48.460
But brothers and sisters in a safe part of the city

00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:51.460
opened their homes to us.

00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:55.460
I learned that a war can't stop Jehovah.

00:31:55.460 --> 00:31:59.460
He'll always find a way to care for his people.

00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:03.700
Nothing can take Jehovah's love away.

00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:09.490
I don't know where he will guide us.

00:32:09.490 --> 00:32:11.490
But I trust him.

00:32:11.490 --> 00:32:20.019
Luda trusted in Jehovah

00:32:20.019 --> 00:32:26.019
and was not overreached by fear or discouragement.

00:32:26.019 --> 00:32:30.019
What does it mean to be overreached?

00:32:30.019 --> 00:32:34.019
Listen carefully as Brother Harold Corcoran explains

00:32:34.019 --> 00:32:38.019
in this morning worship program.

00:32:38.019 --> 00:32:40.019
The expression used in our days tax,

00:32:40.019 --> 00:32:43.019
the word used is overreached.

00:32:43.019 --> 00:32:46.019
And what comes to mind when we hear someone

00:32:46.019 --> 00:32:49.019
that has been overreached?

00:32:49.019 --> 00:32:51.019
Well, to overreach means to get better off,

00:32:51.019 --> 00:32:53.019
or get the better off,

00:32:53.019 --> 00:32:57.019
especially by deceit or trickery,

00:32:57.019 --> 00:33:02.019
to outwit, to overtake, to overpower.

00:33:02.019 --> 00:33:06.019
And so we have to be very careful at all times

00:33:06.019 --> 00:33:08.019
because their enemy, the devil,

00:33:08.019 --> 00:33:12.019
is out to trick us, deceive us, overtake us

00:33:12.019 --> 00:33:15.019
on any occasion possible.

00:33:15.019 --> 00:33:18.019
And he has quite a variety of tactics, doesn't he?

00:33:18.019 --> 00:33:22.019
In fact, the Bible in Ephesians 6, 11 describes these

00:33:22.019 --> 00:33:26.019
as the crafty acts of the devil.

00:33:26.019 --> 00:33:29.019
Now, our context of today's text in the background

00:33:29.019 --> 00:33:32.019
helps us to illustrate just two of those tactics.

00:33:32.019 --> 00:33:37.019
We invite you to open your Bibles to sect of Corinthians 2.

00:33:37.019 --> 00:33:41.019
And in Paul's first letter to the Corinthians,

00:33:41.019 --> 00:33:44.019
the congregation had been affected by a man

00:33:44.019 --> 00:33:47.019
who had been overreached by Satan,

00:33:47.019 --> 00:33:51.019
being involved in very gross sexual immorality.

00:33:51.019 --> 00:33:54.019
When on the top of his being overreached,

00:33:54.019 --> 00:33:57.019
the congregation was tolerating it.

00:33:57.019 --> 00:34:00.019
And so what did Paul tell them in very clear terms?

00:34:00.019 --> 00:34:04.019
You must hand such a man over to Satan,

00:34:04.019 --> 00:34:08.019
remove the wicked person from among you.

00:34:08.019 --> 00:34:11.019
Well, the congregation responded,

00:34:11.019 --> 00:34:14.019
and eventually this very man

00:34:14.019 --> 00:34:18.019
who had been living such an immoral life really repented.

00:34:18.019 --> 00:34:22.019
And now, permissiveness

00:34:22.019 --> 00:34:25.019
and tolerating badness was no longer the issue,

00:34:25.019 --> 00:34:27.019
what was the issue?

00:34:27.019 --> 00:34:30.019
Now a matter of forgiving such a man.

00:34:30.019 --> 00:34:34.019
In sect of Corinthians chapter 2, we read verse 6,

00:34:34.019 --> 00:34:39.019
this rebuke given by the majority is sufficient for such a man.

00:34:39.019 --> 00:34:43.019
Now you should instead kindly forgive and comfort him

00:34:43.019 --> 00:34:48.019
so that he may not be overwhelmed by excessive sadness.

00:34:49.019 --> 00:34:54.019
And who was behind that ploy of excessive sadness, verse 11,

00:34:54.019 --> 00:34:58.019
so that we may not be overreached by Satan

00:34:58.019 --> 00:35:02.019
for we are not ignorant of his designs.

00:35:02.019 --> 00:35:06.019
So the devil will use whatever,

00:35:06.019 --> 00:35:09.019
the temptation of sexual immorality,

00:35:09.019 --> 00:35:12.019
being overly permissive,

00:35:12.019 --> 00:35:17.019
or being harsh, unforgiving, and lacking mercy,

00:35:18.019 --> 00:35:21.019
both of those tactics can be very effective

00:35:21.019 --> 00:35:26.019
in taking Jehovah's people away from their Heavenly Father.

00:35:26.019 --> 00:35:28.019
But on this matter of temptations

00:35:28.019 --> 00:35:31.019
when it comes to sexual immorality,

00:35:31.019 --> 00:35:36.019
let's just briefly talk about another tactic that the devil uses.

00:35:36.019 --> 00:35:41.019
He can convince someone that they can taste or toy with

00:35:41.019 --> 00:35:45.019
things that might be unclean or are unclean,

00:35:45.019 --> 00:35:50.019
but there will be no lasting harm or no serious consequences to that.

00:35:50.019 --> 00:35:53.019
They may even touch something unclean

00:35:53.019 --> 00:35:56.019
and nothing apparently bad has happened,

00:35:56.019 --> 00:35:59.019
and they conclude that it's okay.

00:35:59.019 --> 00:36:03.019
But such a person is forgetting the unchangeable law of Jehovah

00:36:03.019 --> 00:36:06.019
has recorded in Galatians 6.7,

00:36:06.019 --> 00:36:10.019
whatever a man is soying, this he will also reap.

00:36:10.019 --> 00:36:14.019
Now just illustrate that how the devil can use bait

00:36:14.019 --> 00:36:17.019
against somebody that they're not really into any kind of trouble,

00:36:17.019 --> 00:36:20.019
and yet he will catch them.

00:36:20.019 --> 00:36:24.019
We're going to tell you an account that goes back many years.

00:36:24.019 --> 00:36:26.019
There was a group of young men

00:36:26.019 --> 00:36:29.019
at a freshwater lake and they were fishing,

00:36:29.019 --> 00:36:31.019
and they could look down into this lake

00:36:31.019 --> 00:36:36.019
and they could see these big bass, beautiful fish.

00:36:36.019 --> 00:36:39.019
And they tried all sorts of lures.

00:36:39.019 --> 00:36:43.019
They tried worms on hooks, artificial lures,

00:36:43.019 --> 00:36:47.019
those big fish would not bite.

00:36:47.019 --> 00:36:49.019
But then an older gentleman came along and he said,

00:36:49.019 --> 00:36:52.019
give me one of your worms,

00:36:52.019 --> 00:36:54.019
and he took the worm without the hook,

00:36:54.019 --> 00:36:57.019
and he threw it out in the vicinity where these big bass were.

00:36:57.019 --> 00:37:00.019
And a bass came and he took the worm.

00:37:00.019 --> 00:37:03.019
He said, throw another one without the hook.

00:37:03.019 --> 00:37:05.019
Throw it, the bass took it,

00:37:05.019 --> 00:37:07.019
and now he said,

00:37:07.019 --> 00:37:10.019
put the worm on the hook and cast.

00:37:10.019 --> 00:37:13.019
The fish was caught.

00:37:13.019 --> 00:37:15.019
What is the lesson?

00:37:15.019 --> 00:37:17.019
The devil will give us bait sometimes,

00:37:17.019 --> 00:37:19.019
and it appears that it's very pleasurable.

00:37:19.019 --> 00:37:21.019
There's nothing wrong here.

00:37:21.019 --> 00:37:22.019
It's harmless.

00:37:22.019 --> 00:37:26.019
But with the devil, there is always the hook,

00:37:26.019 --> 00:37:28.019
always the hook,

00:37:28.019 --> 00:37:31.019
that can cause spiritual, emotional, mental,

00:37:31.019 --> 00:37:33.019
and even physical harm.

00:37:33.019 --> 00:37:35.019
It can literally cost us our life

00:37:35.019 --> 00:37:38.019
if we get tricked to thinking

00:37:38.019 --> 00:37:42.019
that uncleanness will not hurt us.

00:37:42.019 --> 00:37:46.019
Now besides pleasure and the temptations that go with that,

00:37:46.019 --> 00:37:51.019
the devil will also use pain and suffering.

00:37:51.019 --> 00:37:55.019
For example, in the experience of Job,

00:37:55.019 --> 00:37:58.019
he lost his material possessions.

00:37:58.019 --> 00:38:00.019
He lost his children.

00:38:00.019 --> 00:38:02.019
He got very ill.

00:38:02.019 --> 00:38:07.019
That caused all sorts of physical and emotional pain.

00:38:07.019 --> 00:38:10.019
Not pleasure.

00:38:10.019 --> 00:38:13.019
And with all that he was going through,

00:38:13.019 --> 00:38:16.019
then his so-called friends come to comfort him.

00:38:16.019 --> 00:38:21.019
And they accuse him of all sorts of bad attitudes and actions.

00:38:21.019 --> 00:38:25.019
And they even put doubts in Job's mind or try to

00:38:25.019 --> 00:38:30.369
that Jehovah couldn't be pleased anyway.

00:38:30.369 --> 00:38:34.369
Well, that was one of the toughest tests that he faced.

00:38:34.369 --> 00:38:39.369
This from with his friends and the words that they sent.

00:38:39.369 --> 00:38:41.369
Well, commenting on this,

00:38:41.369 --> 00:38:45.369
the August 15th, 2002 watchtower,

00:38:45.369 --> 00:38:49.369
said this about how a great test can come

00:38:49.369 --> 00:38:51.369
from our fellow worshipers.

00:38:51.369 --> 00:38:53.369
It says this,

00:38:53.369 --> 00:38:56.369
Satan still makes use of misguided counsel

00:38:56.369 --> 00:39:00.369
or thoughtless remarks from friends and fellow believers.

00:39:00.369 --> 00:39:02.369
Discouragement from within the congregation

00:39:02.369 --> 00:39:06.369
and undermining our morale more easily

00:39:06.369 --> 00:39:09.369
than persecution from without.

00:39:09.369 --> 00:39:14.369
And then this article went on to explain that there was a brother serving as an elder,

00:39:14.369 --> 00:39:17.369
but he had seen active combat in the army.

00:39:17.369 --> 00:39:19.369
He had been through terrible things.

00:39:19.369 --> 00:39:22.369
But when he faced criticism,

00:39:22.369 --> 00:39:24.369
thoughtless remarks,

00:39:24.369 --> 00:39:28.369
and was hurt by his fellow workers in the congregation,

00:39:28.369 --> 00:39:31.369
what did he say about those tests within the congregation?

00:39:31.369 --> 00:39:33.369
He says,

00:39:33.369 --> 00:39:37.369
it's the hardest thing I've ever been through in my life.

00:39:37.369 --> 00:39:40.369
So what can the devil use?

00:39:40.369 --> 00:39:44.369
Our own brothers can say or do things sometimes,

00:39:44.369 --> 00:39:47.369
and the devil will play on that and amplify that

00:39:47.369 --> 00:39:52.369
and cause one to stop serving Job.

00:39:52.369 --> 00:39:55.369
Well, obviously there's a variety of crafty acts,

00:39:55.369 --> 00:39:59.369
and we've only covered just a couple of them this morning.

00:39:59.369 --> 00:40:02.369
But what do we do to protect ourselves?

00:40:02.369 --> 00:40:04.369
James 4.7 says,

00:40:04.369 --> 00:40:07.369
therefore, subject yourselves to God,

00:40:07.369 --> 00:40:10.369
but oppose the devil.

00:40:10.369 --> 00:40:12.369
And when we do that,

00:40:12.369 --> 00:40:14.369
we always must remember

00:40:14.369 --> 00:40:16.369
the model prayer given by Jesus,

00:40:16.369 --> 00:40:18.369
where he said,

00:40:18.369 --> 00:40:22.369
deliver us from the wicked one.

00:40:22.369 --> 00:40:25.369
Now, why is that so important?

00:40:26.369 --> 00:40:29.369
Well, we bear Jehovah's name,

00:40:29.369 --> 00:40:32.369
and he is very anxious to protect his name,

00:40:32.369 --> 00:40:34.369
and he loves us very much.

00:40:34.369 --> 00:40:36.369
He's our father.

00:40:36.369 --> 00:40:38.369
And like any loving father,

00:40:38.369 --> 00:40:42.369
if he saw one of his faithful sons going through a terrible trial

00:40:42.369 --> 00:40:44.369
by someone that was trying to kill him,

00:40:44.369 --> 00:40:48.369
that father would respond quickly, wouldn't he?

00:40:48.369 --> 00:40:51.369
Well, how does Jehovah feel about us?

00:40:51.369 --> 00:40:55.369
Well, let's open our Bibles to the book of Malachi,

00:40:55.369 --> 00:40:59.369
and just re-emphasize how much Jehovah cares for us,

00:40:59.369 --> 00:41:02.369
and why he would respond so quickly to our Christ

00:41:02.369 --> 00:41:06.369
for help to deliver us from the wicked one.

00:41:06.369 --> 00:41:09.369
And Malachi 3 and verse 17,

00:41:09.369 --> 00:41:10.369
it says,

00:41:10.369 --> 00:41:12.369
and they will be mine,

00:41:12.369 --> 00:41:14.369
says Jehovah of armies.

00:41:14.369 --> 00:41:18.369
In the day when I produce a special property,

00:41:18.369 --> 00:41:23.369
I will show them compassion just as a man shows compassion

00:41:23.369 --> 00:41:27.369
to his son who serves him.

00:41:27.369 --> 00:41:31.369
Well, that warm arrangement there, isn't it?

00:41:31.369 --> 00:41:33.369
And Jehovah cares for us.

00:41:33.369 --> 00:41:36.369
Other Bible translations when it talks about special property

00:41:36.369 --> 00:41:38.369
use these expressions.

00:41:38.369 --> 00:41:40.369
My very own.

00:41:40.369 --> 00:41:42.369
My most prized possession.

00:41:42.369 --> 00:41:44.369
My jewels.

00:41:44.369 --> 00:41:46.369
Jehovah loves us.

00:41:46.369 --> 00:41:51.369
And Jehovah will only allow the devil to go so far

00:41:51.369 --> 00:41:55.369
in testing us, only according to what Jehovah wills at the moment.

00:41:55.369 --> 00:41:57.369
For example,

00:41:57.369 --> 00:42:01.369
remember in the case of Job when fire came down from heaven

00:42:01.369 --> 00:42:04.369
and consumed Job's flock of sheep,

00:42:04.369 --> 00:42:06.369
and even some of his servants,

00:42:06.369 --> 00:42:08.369
the devil calls that fire.

00:42:08.369 --> 00:42:10.369
Jehovah allowed it.

00:42:10.369 --> 00:42:12.369
But later in 1 Kings chapter 18,

00:42:12.369 --> 00:42:16.369
at the fire test at Mount Carmel,

00:42:16.369 --> 00:42:18.369
when there were two bulls,

00:42:18.369 --> 00:42:21.369
and the idea was to figure out who is the true God.

00:42:21.369 --> 00:42:23.369
Jehovah or a bale.

00:42:23.369 --> 00:42:26.369
And those bale worshipers went from morning to night,

00:42:26.369 --> 00:42:29.369
crying out to their false God,

00:42:29.369 --> 00:42:33.369
and not one flicker of flame could be produced.

00:42:33.369 --> 00:42:38.369
Jehovah would not allow the devil to even burn up one bull

00:42:38.369 --> 00:42:42.369
in contrast to what he had done with all those many sheep.

00:42:42.369 --> 00:42:45.369
Jehovah is in control.

00:42:45.369 --> 00:42:47.369
And what Jehovah allows today,

00:42:47.369 --> 00:42:49.369
we can be sure,

00:42:49.369 --> 00:42:51.369
whatever he allows the devil to do,

00:42:51.369 --> 00:42:55.369
to cause his emotional pain, physical pain,

00:42:55.369 --> 00:42:57.369
to even persecute us,

00:42:57.369 --> 00:42:59.369
perhaps even kill some of us.

00:42:59.369 --> 00:43:02.369
By means of his son Christ Jesus,

00:43:02.369 --> 00:43:07.369
Jehovah has made a way to break up the works of the devil completely.

00:43:08.369 --> 00:43:10.369
So whatever happens,

00:43:10.369 --> 00:43:12.369
when we stay loyal to Jehovah,

00:43:12.369 --> 00:43:15.369
and we are on guard against the crafty acts of the devil,

00:43:15.369 --> 00:43:17.369
we will not be overreached.

00:43:17.369 --> 00:43:20.369
No permanent harm can come to Jehovah's people

00:43:20.369 --> 00:43:24.369
by this deceitful treacherous enemy.

00:43:24.369 --> 00:43:28.369
May all of us continue to stay on the alert.

00:43:28.369 --> 00:43:31.369
Be mindful of the devil's tactics.

00:43:31.369 --> 00:43:33.369
Beg Jehovah to deliver us,

00:43:33.369 --> 00:43:36.369
and then we can be confident that our loving Heavenly Father

00:43:36.369 --> 00:43:39.369
will never abandon us.

00:43:39.369 --> 00:43:42.369
Satan may even use family members

00:43:42.369 --> 00:43:47.369
who mean well to discourage us from serving Jehovah.

00:43:47.369 --> 00:43:49.369
If this is your situation,

00:43:49.369 --> 00:43:52.369
you will find the following episode

00:43:52.369 --> 00:43:54.369
of where are they now,

00:43:54.369 --> 00:43:56.369
especially strengthening.

00:43:56.369 --> 00:44:05.789
My name is Karen Malone,

00:44:05.789 --> 00:44:07.789
and I was born in Iowa,

00:44:07.789 --> 00:44:09.789
but I was raised all over

00:44:09.789 --> 00:44:12.789
because my dad was in the military.

00:44:12.789 --> 00:44:13.789
When I think about Karen

00:44:13.789 --> 00:44:16.789
and how she came to the truth that touches my heart,

00:44:16.789 --> 00:44:19.789
because she had no family in the truth,

00:44:19.789 --> 00:44:22.789
and in fact they didn't support her at all.

00:44:22.789 --> 00:44:24.789
Once I knew who Jehovah was,

00:44:24.789 --> 00:44:26.789
I made it a goal in my life

00:44:26.789 --> 00:44:28.789
that I just wanted to serve him forever,

00:44:28.789 --> 00:44:30.789
and I wanted to be happy doing it.

00:44:30.789 --> 00:44:41.909
I met Karen at Bethel.

00:44:41.909 --> 00:44:44.909
She was special pioneering in Tennessee,

00:44:44.909 --> 00:44:46.909
and I was serving at Bethel,

00:44:46.909 --> 00:44:49.909
and she came through on tour.

00:44:49.909 --> 00:44:52.909
A year later, so we got married,

00:44:52.909 --> 00:44:53.909
and then nine months later,

00:44:53.909 --> 00:44:55.909
we went back to Bethel.

00:44:55.909 --> 00:44:57.909
Well, in 1980,

00:44:57.909 --> 00:44:58.909
we left Bethel,

00:44:58.909 --> 00:45:00.909
we had our daughter that year.

00:45:00.909 --> 00:45:02.909
It changed things,

00:45:02.909 --> 00:45:04.909
but you just give your energy

00:45:04.909 --> 00:45:06.909
and your love and your time

00:45:06.909 --> 00:45:11.380
into whatever assignment Jehovah gives us.

00:45:11.380 --> 00:45:12.380
She would take the kids out

00:45:12.380 --> 00:45:14.380
with her in the field ministry during a week,

00:45:14.380 --> 00:45:16.380
and she always made it fun.

00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:18.380
That was one of the things

00:45:18.380 --> 00:45:19.380
that was important to her

00:45:19.380 --> 00:45:22.380
that when the kids went in the field ministry,

00:45:22.380 --> 00:45:27.170
that they enjoyed it.

00:45:27.170 --> 00:45:29.170
It's just a matter of,

00:45:29.170 --> 00:45:31.170
blooming where you're planted,

00:45:31.170 --> 00:45:33.170
wherever you're at.

00:45:33.170 --> 00:45:35.170
We didn't ever walk into a congregation

00:45:35.170 --> 00:45:38.170
and expect people to come up to us.

00:45:38.170 --> 00:45:40.170
We'd be proactive in meeting people,

00:45:40.170 --> 00:45:43.170
and trying to become a part of wherever we were put,

00:45:43.170 --> 00:45:46.170
so that we could become our home.

00:45:46.170 --> 00:45:47.170
It's just loving them.

00:45:47.170 --> 00:45:49.170
If they needed soup, we'd make soup.

00:45:49.170 --> 00:45:51.170
If they needed a meal,

00:45:51.170 --> 00:45:53.170
if they needed their house cleaned,

00:45:53.170 --> 00:45:54.170
if they needed a babysitter,

00:45:54.170 --> 00:45:55.170
if there was a need,

00:45:55.170 --> 00:45:58.170
we wanted to help them with it.

00:45:58.170 --> 00:46:00.170
There's so many challenges in life

00:46:00.170 --> 00:46:03.170
that try to rob us of our peace,

00:46:03.170 --> 00:46:06.170
and it's our choice if we let them.

00:46:06.170 --> 00:46:13.400
So, we don't let them.

00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:16.400
We were invited back to Bethel in 2007,

00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:19.809
and we've been there since.

00:46:19.809 --> 00:46:21.809
I came into a beautiful department,

00:46:21.809 --> 00:46:22.809
healthcare department,

00:46:22.809 --> 00:46:25.809
with people that were experts at it.

00:46:25.809 --> 00:46:27.809
To bloom where I was planted,

00:46:27.809 --> 00:46:29.809
when I was put in front of these two computer screens,

00:46:29.809 --> 00:46:30.809
took a lot of prayer.

00:46:30.809 --> 00:46:32.809
And I remember literally going to the bathroom

00:46:32.809 --> 00:46:34.809
and crying and telling Jehovah,

00:46:34.809 --> 00:46:37.809
look, I know you can part the Red Sea.

00:46:37.809 --> 00:46:39.809
You're going to have to get this information

00:46:39.809 --> 00:46:40.809
from here to here,

00:46:40.809 --> 00:46:42.809
because I was a blank paint,

00:46:42.809 --> 00:46:44.809
and the beautiful thing is that

00:46:44.809 --> 00:46:46.809
two precious sisters, Bonnie and Zuma,

00:46:46.809 --> 00:46:48.809
that I still treasure and work with,

00:46:48.809 --> 00:46:49.809
they helped me,

00:46:49.809 --> 00:46:51.809
and they taught me.

00:46:52.809 --> 00:46:53.809
You know, the expression,

00:46:53.809 --> 00:46:54.809
if you can't change your circumstance,

00:46:54.809 --> 00:46:56.809
change your attitude.

00:46:56.809 --> 00:46:58.809
So, I really made it a matter of prayer,

00:46:58.809 --> 00:47:00.809
and again, I had wonderful helpers

00:47:00.809 --> 00:47:06.570
that taught me and helped me to learn.

00:47:06.570 --> 00:47:07.570
When I first learned the truth,

00:47:07.570 --> 00:47:09.570
I realized that there's scriptures

00:47:09.570 --> 00:47:11.570
that teach us the truth,

00:47:11.570 --> 00:47:12.570
and then there's scriptures

00:47:12.570 --> 00:47:14.570
that will keep us in the truth.

00:47:14.570 --> 00:47:16.570
And I call those my heart scriptures.

00:47:16.570 --> 00:47:18.570
And those are my two go-to scriptures

00:47:18.570 --> 00:47:20.570
when things were rough,

00:47:20.570 --> 00:47:22.570
when I was dealing with things,

00:47:23.570 --> 00:47:25.570
something was trying to rob me of my joy.

00:47:25.570 --> 00:47:27.570
I'd refer to those heart scriptures,

00:47:27.570 --> 00:47:30.570
and they would reinforce the conviction

00:47:30.570 --> 00:47:34.570
that, oh, no, you're not going to win Satan.

00:47:34.570 --> 00:47:36.570
My favorite scripture

00:47:36.570 --> 00:47:38.570
that I think epitomizes that

00:47:38.570 --> 00:47:40.570
is Proverbs 27 and 11,

00:47:40.570 --> 00:47:41.570
which we all know where it says,

00:47:41.570 --> 00:47:43.570
be wise, my son,

00:47:43.570 --> 00:47:44.570
and make my heart rejoice,

00:47:44.570 --> 00:47:46.570
so that I can make a reply

00:47:46.570 --> 00:47:48.570
to him who taunts me.

00:47:48.570 --> 00:47:49.570
That's what it's all about.

00:47:49.570 --> 00:47:51.570
It's about Jehovah's name,

00:47:51.570 --> 00:47:53.570
and to make a reply to the devil,

00:47:53.570 --> 00:47:55.570
his sovereignty is what's important.

00:47:55.570 --> 00:47:57.570
It's not about us.

00:47:57.570 --> 00:48:01.570
We really love being parents,

00:48:01.570 --> 00:48:03.570
loved pioneering together.

00:48:03.570 --> 00:48:07.570
We've loved every gift that we've been given.

00:48:07.570 --> 00:48:10.980
I tell my kids,

00:48:10.980 --> 00:48:12.980
each day we live as a gift from God,

00:48:12.980 --> 00:48:16.980
how we live it is our gift to him.

00:48:16.980 --> 00:48:19.980
The truth is only hard if we fight it.

00:48:19.980 --> 00:48:21.980
If we listen to Jehovah,

00:48:21.980 --> 00:48:23.980
if we do what we're asked,

00:48:23.980 --> 00:48:27.980
the blessings will catch up with us.

00:48:27.980 --> 00:48:29.980
The best day we could have here

00:48:29.980 --> 00:48:31.980
and when, oh, we've all had wonderful days,

00:48:31.980 --> 00:48:33.980
is nothing in comparison

00:48:33.980 --> 00:48:37.980
to the first day in the new world.

00:48:37.980 --> 00:48:39.980
It's such an amazing thought

00:48:39.980 --> 00:48:41.980
to think that all we have to do

00:48:41.980 --> 00:48:43.980
is make good choices now,

00:48:43.980 --> 00:48:51.829
and we're going to be there.

00:48:51.829 --> 00:48:53.829
How delighted we are

00:48:53.829 --> 00:48:55.829
that Karen not only found the support

00:48:55.829 --> 00:48:57.829
of spiritual family,

00:48:57.829 --> 00:49:01.829
but now contributes so much to it.

00:49:01.829 --> 00:49:05.829
Our spiritual family can bring us much joy and peace,

00:49:05.829 --> 00:49:09.829
as we'll see in this month's music video.

00:49:09.829 --> 00:49:28.619
It's hard to face this life with all we see.

00:49:28.619 --> 00:49:35.260
To not focus on the uncertainty.

00:49:35.260 --> 00:49:39.659
If she starts at times,

00:49:39.659 --> 00:49:42.659
we all may feel

00:49:42.659 --> 00:49:46.670
but when we pray,

00:49:46.670 --> 00:49:48.670
his promise is read.

00:49:48.670 --> 00:49:55.619
He gives us peace like a river.

00:49:55.619 --> 00:50:12.639
He's like a ghost and strong.

00:50:12.639 --> 00:50:23.500
His peace will flow forever.

00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:49.949
Yes, peace like a river is listening.

00:50:49.949 --> 00:50:51.949
He's always there.

00:50:51.949 --> 00:51:01.739
But us and God are heart and mind.

00:51:01.739 --> 00:51:12.079
And failing love from his eyes.

00:51:12.079 --> 00:51:19.230
He's like a river.

00:51:19.230 --> 00:51:38.800
He's like a ghost and strong.

00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:40.800
His peace will flow forever.

00:51:40.800 --> 00:52:18.670
Yes, peace like a river is listening.

00:52:18.670 --> 00:53:10.989
His peace like a river is listening.

00:53:10.989 --> 00:53:12.989
What do you do in the ministry

00:53:12.989 --> 00:53:16.989
when it seems like no one is home?

00:53:16.989 --> 00:53:18.989
As we'll see in this next episode

00:53:18.989 --> 00:53:20.989
of Iron Shopping's Iron,

00:53:20.989 --> 00:53:24.989
there may still be many opportunities

00:53:24.989 --> 00:53:26.989
all around us to give a witness.

00:53:26.989 --> 00:53:30.989
Hello, I am Victor Annie Barber

00:53:30.989 --> 00:53:32.989
and this is Iron Shopping's Iron.

00:53:32.989 --> 00:53:43.019
Now, so far in our series,

00:53:43.019 --> 00:53:47.019
we've discussed how we can become more effective

00:53:47.019 --> 00:53:49.019
at our ministry in a number of different ways,

00:53:49.019 --> 00:53:53.019
such as by starting conversations,

00:53:53.019 --> 00:53:57.019
asking questions and getting better at return visits.

00:53:57.019 --> 00:54:01.019
But these techniques only work

00:54:01.019 --> 00:54:05.019
if we actually find people to talk to.

00:54:05.019 --> 00:54:09.019
And sometimes that can be our greatest challenge.

00:54:09.019 --> 00:54:22.369
Have you ever had days like this in the ministry

00:54:22.369 --> 00:54:26.369
when it seemed that there was just no one to talk to?

00:54:26.369 --> 00:54:30.369
If so, you'll be pleased to know that our literature

00:54:30.369 --> 00:54:34.369
is full of tips that can help us contact more people

00:54:34.369 --> 00:54:36.369
in our territory.

00:54:36.369 --> 00:54:38.369
In this episode, we will consider

00:54:38.369 --> 00:54:42.369
three that have proved to be very effective.

00:54:42.369 --> 00:54:44.369
Tip number one,

00:54:44.369 --> 00:54:48.369
be observance.

00:54:48.369 --> 00:54:50.369
There may actually be more opportunities

00:54:50.369 --> 00:54:52.369
for us to contact people

00:54:52.369 --> 00:54:56.369
if we actually know where to look.

00:54:56.369 --> 00:54:58.369
Take, for example, our brothers and sisters

00:54:58.369 --> 00:55:00.369
that we were just watching.

00:55:00.369 --> 00:55:02.369
Now, it is true that there was no one at home,

00:55:02.369 --> 00:55:06.369
but does that mean there was no one to talk to?

00:55:06.369 --> 00:55:08.369
Well, let's see.

00:55:08.369 --> 00:55:14.050
Hey!

00:55:14.050 --> 00:55:16.050
Hey!

00:55:16.050 --> 00:55:18.050
You're so cute.

00:55:18.050 --> 00:55:20.050
What's the name?

00:55:20.050 --> 00:55:24.449
And just like that, a conversation is underway.

00:55:24.449 --> 00:55:32.960
Now, how about our couple getting back into their car?

00:55:32.960 --> 00:55:34.960
By being observant,

00:55:34.960 --> 00:55:36.960
they too were able to give a witness.

00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:38.960
The more observant we are,

00:55:38.960 --> 00:55:42.960
the more opportunities we may find.

00:55:42.960 --> 00:55:46.960
The key is to remain focused on our objective,

00:55:46.960 --> 00:55:50.960
which is to give a witness.

00:55:50.960 --> 00:55:52.960
And that can happen in between doors,

00:55:52.960 --> 00:55:56.960
just as easily as it could happen at the doors.

00:55:56.960 --> 00:56:00.960
So how about our tip number two?

00:56:00.960 --> 00:56:04.960
It is be prepared.

00:56:04.960 --> 00:56:08.960
How often have you encountered someone in your territory

00:56:08.960 --> 00:56:10.960
who doesn't speak your language?

00:56:10.960 --> 00:56:12.960
You know, growing up in London,

00:56:12.960 --> 00:56:14.960
this used to happen all the time.

00:56:14.960 --> 00:56:16.960
But these days, it's not just big cities

00:56:16.960 --> 00:56:20.960
where we find this mixture of culture and languages.

00:56:20.960 --> 00:56:24.960
The whole world is becoming so much more cosmopolitan.

00:56:24.960 --> 00:56:30.960
So what can we do to be prepared?

00:56:30.960 --> 00:56:32.960
Well, we don't have the gift of tongues

00:56:32.960 --> 00:56:36.960
like the first century Christians did at Pentecost.

00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:42.960
But we do have the gift of J-W language.

00:56:42.960 --> 00:56:46.960
Now, with this app, you can learn a simple presentation

00:56:46.960 --> 00:56:48.960
in dozens of different languages.

00:56:48.960 --> 00:56:50.960
Let's take a look.

00:56:50.960 --> 00:56:54.960
It's designed in a very easy-to-use manner.

00:56:54.960 --> 00:56:56.960
First,

00:56:56.960 --> 00:57:02.559
set the primary language to the one you speak

00:57:02.559 --> 00:57:08.480
and the target language to the one you want to learn.

00:57:08.480 --> 00:57:10.480
Then, under preaching skills,

00:57:10.480 --> 00:57:14.480
choose greetings and introductions

00:57:14.480 --> 00:57:18.480
to learn how to say a simple hello.

00:57:18.480 --> 00:57:24.480
And I'm pleased to meet you.

00:57:24.480 --> 00:57:26.480
What was the Yomitisa?

00:57:26.480 --> 00:57:32.480
Dobriden Priyemno Yomitisa.

00:57:32.480 --> 00:57:34.480
I think I've made a mess of that.

00:57:34.480 --> 00:57:36.480
Let's try it again.

00:57:36.480 --> 00:57:40.480
Dobriden Priyemno Paznoyomitisa.

00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:44.480
Well, I still need to work on my accent.

00:57:44.480 --> 00:57:46.480
But I think you get the idea.

00:57:46.480 --> 00:57:48.480
With a little practice,

00:57:48.480 --> 00:57:50.480
you can ask simple questions

00:57:50.480 --> 00:57:54.480
and even introduce and explain a scripture.

00:57:54.480 --> 00:57:56.480
It really works.

00:57:56.480 --> 00:57:58.480
Let's look at an example.

00:57:58.480 --> 00:58:00.480
Hi there. We're making brief visits on our native.

00:58:00.480 --> 00:58:02.480
Hi, no, no speaking.

00:58:02.480 --> 00:58:04.480
Oh, Arabic.

00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:06.480
Oh, Arabic.

00:58:06.480 --> 00:58:08.480
Arabic.

00:58:08.480 --> 00:58:10.480
Oh, did you speak Arabic?

00:58:10.480 --> 00:58:12.480
Yes.

00:58:12.480 --> 00:58:19.480
What a great way to give a witness

00:58:19.480 --> 00:58:21.480
to even more in our territory.

00:58:21.480 --> 00:58:25.480
Now, if mastering a whole presentation

00:58:25.480 --> 00:58:27.480
in another language seems a bit overwhelming,

00:58:27.480 --> 00:58:29.480
then here's a simple suggestion.

00:58:29.480 --> 00:58:31.480
Just learn a greeting.

00:58:31.480 --> 00:58:33.480
It's only a few words,

00:58:33.480 --> 00:58:35.480
but don't underestimate the power

00:58:35.480 --> 00:58:39.480
of greeting someone in their native tongue

00:58:39.480 --> 00:58:41.480
and with a warm smile.

00:58:41.480 --> 00:58:43.480
It can certainly open up doors

00:58:43.480 --> 00:58:45.480
and it could also pave the way

00:58:45.480 --> 00:58:47.480
for you to call back with someone

00:58:47.480 --> 00:58:49.480
who does speak their language.

00:58:49.480 --> 00:58:53.480
And that brings us on to our third tip.

00:58:53.480 --> 00:58:57.480
Be diligent and follow up.

00:58:57.480 --> 00:59:01.480
Which, first of all, means trying to contact all those

00:59:01.480 --> 00:59:03.480
who weren't home initially,

00:59:03.480 --> 00:59:05.480
either on a different day

00:59:05.480 --> 00:59:07.480
or at a different time.

00:59:07.480 --> 00:59:09.480
And if you can't find them in that way,

00:59:09.480 --> 00:59:11.480
then don't overlook letter writing

00:59:11.480 --> 00:59:13.480
and telephone witnessing.

00:59:13.480 --> 00:59:15.480
These methods prove very effective

00:59:15.480 --> 00:59:17.480
during the pandemic.

00:59:17.480 --> 00:59:19.480
And even now, they can still help us

00:59:19.480 --> 00:59:21.480
to reach those we can't find at home.

00:59:21.480 --> 00:59:25.480
Regardless of what way we have contacted someone,

00:59:25.480 --> 00:59:29.480
please be sure not to forget them,

00:59:29.480 --> 00:59:31.480
but return promptly to follow up

00:59:31.480 --> 00:59:35.480
on any interest that you have found.

00:59:35.480 --> 00:59:37.480
You know, reaching everyone in our territory

00:59:37.480 --> 00:59:39.480
is definitely a challenge.

00:59:39.480 --> 00:59:43.480
But the tips we've discussed here today,

00:59:43.480 --> 00:59:45.480
one being observant,

00:59:45.480 --> 00:59:47.480
two being prepared,

00:59:47.480 --> 00:59:49.480
and three being diligent

00:59:49.480 --> 00:59:53.480
as we follow up on interest that we find,

00:59:53.480 --> 00:59:57.480
can help all of us fully accomplish our ministry.

00:59:57.480 --> 00:59:59.480
If we do that,

00:59:59.480 --> 01:00:01.480
we'll be imitating Jesus

01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:03.480
who wanted to give everyone

01:00:03.480 --> 01:00:07.480
an opportunity to come to know Jehovah.

01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:11.480
What excellent suggestions for the ministry.

01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:13.480
I look forward to using them

01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:17.480
during our upcoming regional convention campaign.

01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:19.480
Would you like to have a look

01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:23.480
at what to expect from this year's convention program?

01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:34.940
Good news is needed now

01:00:34.940 --> 01:00:40.260
more than ever.

01:00:40.260 --> 01:00:44.260
The good news we need is not of human origin.

01:00:44.260 --> 01:00:47.260
It originates with the giver of real hope,

01:00:47.260 --> 01:00:49.260
Jehovah God.

01:00:49.260 --> 01:00:51.260
And it centers on his son,

01:00:51.260 --> 01:00:53.260
Jesus Christ.

01:00:53.260 --> 01:00:58.659
What is this good news?

01:00:58.659 --> 01:01:00.659
Can we trust it?

01:01:00.659 --> 01:01:07.570
And can it help people right now?

01:01:07.570 --> 01:01:09.570
This year's declared the good news convention

01:01:09.570 --> 01:01:11.570
of Jehovah's Witnesses

01:01:11.570 --> 01:01:13.570
will bolster confidence

01:01:13.570 --> 01:01:17.570
in God and his son.

01:01:17.570 --> 01:01:19.570
The good news of God's Kingdom

01:01:19.570 --> 01:01:21.570
will help you to cope with life now

01:01:21.570 --> 01:01:23.570
and prepare you for eternal life

01:01:23.570 --> 01:01:25.570
in the future.

01:01:25.570 --> 01:01:29.570
Now that is good news.

01:01:29.570 --> 01:01:38.610
We have a lot to look forward to

01:01:38.610 --> 01:01:40.610
at this year's convention.

01:01:40.610 --> 01:01:42.610
And what a faith-straining program

01:01:42.610 --> 01:01:44.610
we've just enjoyed.

01:01:44.610 --> 01:01:48.610
We learned that anyone who fights against God

01:01:48.610 --> 01:01:52.610
is on the losing side of the battle.

01:01:52.610 --> 01:01:56.610
We show our desire to work with God

01:01:56.610 --> 01:01:59.610
by keeping peace in the congregation

01:01:59.610 --> 01:02:03.610
and by giving our all in the preaching work.

01:02:03.610 --> 01:02:06.610
In the dramatization,

01:02:06.610 --> 01:02:09.610
young Luda learned that Jehovah

01:02:09.610 --> 01:02:13.610
never abandons his loyal ones.

01:02:13.610 --> 01:02:17.610
And our music video beautifully illustrated

01:02:17.610 --> 01:02:21.610
that peace and strength belong to those

01:02:21.610 --> 01:02:23.610
who rely on Jehovah.

01:02:23.610 --> 01:02:27.889
We have one more treat in store for you.

01:02:27.889 --> 01:02:29.889
We're happy to announce

01:02:29.889 --> 01:02:33.889
a new series for our young people

01:02:33.889 --> 01:02:37.889
called Learn from Jehovah's Friends.

01:02:37.889 --> 01:02:41.889
These short animated videos will teach those

01:02:41.889 --> 01:02:43.889
who are starting to read on their own

01:02:43.889 --> 01:02:45.889
about persons in the Bible

01:02:45.889 --> 01:02:47.889
who love Jehovah.

01:02:47.889 --> 01:02:53.170
Look for it on JW Broadcasting soon.

01:02:53.170 --> 01:02:56.170
A video postcard this month

01:02:56.170 --> 01:02:58.170
comes from a place known

01:02:58.170 --> 01:03:01.170
of incorruptible people.

01:03:01.170 --> 01:03:03.170
Where might that be?

01:03:03.170 --> 01:03:07.170
The country's name combines two words,

01:03:07.170 --> 01:03:10.170
integrity in the Moray language

01:03:10.170 --> 01:03:15.170
and homeland in the Jula language.

01:03:15.170 --> 01:03:17.170
It's Burkina Faso,

01:03:17.170 --> 01:03:21.170
a landlocked country in West Africa.

01:03:21.170 --> 01:03:25.170
The first kingdom publisher arrived in Burkina Faso

01:03:25.170 --> 01:03:29.170
from Ghana in 1959.

01:03:29.170 --> 01:03:34.170
In 1972, the first of many

01:03:34.170 --> 01:03:37.170
intrepid missionaries arrived.

01:03:37.170 --> 01:03:40.170
And just two years later,

01:03:40.170 --> 01:03:42.170
congregations were formed in the capital,

01:03:42.170 --> 01:03:44.170
Wagadougou,

01:03:44.170 --> 01:03:46.170
and in Bobo de Alassou

01:03:46.170 --> 01:03:50.420
in the west of the country.

01:03:50.420 --> 01:03:53.420
Daytime temperatures average around 30 degrees Celsius

01:03:53.420 --> 01:03:56.420
or 86 degrees Fahrenheit,

01:03:56.420 --> 01:03:58.420
and may be much warmer

01:03:58.420 --> 01:04:01.420
during the peak of the dry season.

01:04:01.420 --> 01:04:04.420
Often, a host will welcome visitors

01:04:04.420 --> 01:04:06.420
with a drink of water.

01:04:06.420 --> 01:04:08.420
A common saying in the Moray language

01:04:08.420 --> 01:04:11.420
is san lakorum,

01:04:11.420 --> 01:04:16.420
which literally means the guest is water.

01:04:16.420 --> 01:04:19.420
Jehovah's people are working hard

01:04:19.420 --> 01:04:22.420
to take life-giving waters

01:04:22.420 --> 01:04:27.420
of Bible truth to the nearly 23 million people

01:04:27.420 --> 01:04:32.420
scattered in villages through the savanna and forest.

01:04:32.420 --> 01:04:35.420
In March 2023,

01:04:35.420 --> 01:04:38.420
Burkina Faso reached a new peak

01:04:38.420 --> 01:04:43.420
of 684 auxiliary pioneers.

01:04:43.420 --> 01:04:45.420
Today,

01:04:45.420 --> 01:04:48.420
there are over 2,000 publishers

01:04:48.420 --> 01:04:51.420
in Burkina Faso.

01:04:51.420 --> 01:04:53.420
This is no small feat,

01:04:53.420 --> 01:04:56.420
owing to the travel difficulties between villages

01:04:56.420 --> 01:05:00.420
and the 66 indigenous languages

01:05:00.420 --> 01:05:03.420
spoken throughout the country.

01:05:03.420 --> 01:05:06.420
Two remote translation offices

01:05:06.420 --> 01:05:11.420
produced literature for the Moray and Jula languages.

01:05:11.420 --> 01:05:13.420
And in 2023,

01:05:13.420 --> 01:05:16.420
our brothers were overjoyed

01:05:16.420 --> 01:05:19.420
to receive the complete new world translation

01:05:19.420 --> 01:05:21.420
in the Moray language.

01:05:21.420 --> 01:05:23.420
The brothers and sisters

01:05:23.420 --> 01:05:25.420
from the Camboyansi Moray

01:05:25.420 --> 01:05:28.420
and the Tampoyi Moray congregations

01:05:28.420 --> 01:05:31.420
sent their love and affection

01:05:31.420 --> 01:05:34.420
to the worldwide brotherhood.

01:05:34.420 --> 01:05:37.420
We hope you enjoyed our monthly program.

01:05:37.420 --> 01:05:40.420
And I want to thank you, Sake, for all your help.

01:05:40.420 --> 01:05:42.420
It was really appreciated.

01:05:42.420 --> 01:05:43.420
Welcome.

01:05:43.420 --> 01:05:45.420
From the World Headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses,

01:05:45.420 --> 01:05:49.420
this is JW Broadcasting.
