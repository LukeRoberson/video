00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:06.750
I was the youngest of a family of three.

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.050
We lived in a little bit of town in Louisiana.

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.960
It was predominantly Catholic.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.960
In the Catholic Church, the way that we were taught to pray

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.559
was a set of repetitive prayers.

00:00:19.559 --> 00:00:21.760
Really, it was easy to pray like that,

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.559
because you really didn't have to think

00:00:24.559 --> 00:00:27.260
once you had those prayers memorized,

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.760
which was at a very early age.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.539
It was just a rote around the time

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.140
that I was just about out of college going into law school.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:40.340
There was something missing.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:48.100
I wanted to be close to God, but I didn't know how.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.799
I met Sharon in 1986,

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:56.100
and we ended up getting married the following year.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.399
Sharon and I, because she had been divorced,

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:01.100
we were not allowed to have our marriage

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.099
be conducted in the Catholic Church with a priest.

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:06.900
And that that didn't bother me at first,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
but over time it did.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.099
I asked them what it would take for us

00:01:11.099 --> 00:01:13.299
to be able to bless our marriage.

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:16.799
She would have to undergo a period of sessions

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.000
of religious training.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.500
When he asked me that, I said,

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.000
yeah, I'll study with him.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.200
We never, ever opened up a body.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.299
It was a little disappointing.

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:33.599
Around that same time,

00:01:33.599 --> 00:01:35.700
there was a cellist sister.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.299
I would study with her and was all by me.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.900
As I continued learning about the Bible,

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.200
the reasoning from the Scriptures was so great.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.700
It was something that I knew I wasn't going to be able

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.200
to brush off.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.200
So she came forward and said,

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.200
I have something to tell you.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.500
I have been studying with the Jehovah's Witnesses

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.799
for a period of time.

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.000
I am convinced that this is the true religion

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.800
and I do not want to participate anymore

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.400
in the Catholic faith, the Catholic Church.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.699
What made me to tell Mike about my Bible study

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:19.699
was Genesis 6.

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:21.300
It matters what we do,

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.300
how we can affect Jehovah

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.900
and he can feel hurt in his heart

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.900
and it crushed me.

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.099
It crushed me because

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:36.569
it up the love that he has for us.

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:38.569
I consider it to be the dark years

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:41.270
because there was so much animosity on my part.

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:46.669
He was trying to do anything he could to get me to stop.

00:02:46.669 --> 00:02:49.370
I even talked about divorce,

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.969
thinking that the shock and awe treatment

00:02:52.969 --> 00:02:54.569
might bring it to her senses.

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:57.469
He would actually pack up a suitcase and leave.

00:02:57.469 --> 00:03:04.270
She, in fact, was becoming a better wife and a better mother.

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.969
The sister, my teacher, she'd say,

00:03:06.969 --> 00:03:11.569
this is good that he is being so jealous about his faith

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:13.569
because he loves God.

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:15.069
Like Paul, you know,

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:20.539
he thought that was the right thing to do.

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:22.939
I was trained as a lawyer.

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:24.340
I get a case.

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.539
I usually know nothing about it.

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:28.139
I do an investigation.

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:32.139
I retain experts to help me understand what I don't understand.

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:33.340
So naturally,

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.240
I'm going to go to my church.

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:38.439
I'm going to go to my religious leaders,

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:42.939
my spiritual leaders and get them to help me with this.

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:47.539
I made an appointment with a very, very high ranking priest.

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:49.340
I told him that my wife was studying

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:50.840
with the Jehovah's Witnesses

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.939
and I was seeking some help.

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:54.740
And the first thing that he told me,

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:56.039
and I'll never forget this,

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:57.539
he looked straight at me

00:03:57.539 --> 00:04:01.439
and said it would take nothing short of a miracle

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:05.139
for me to pull my wife away from the Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:09.539
Because they knew the Bible so well.

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:11.039
In my life at that point

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:12.240
where I'm struggling,

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:14.939
I'm trying to win over my family,

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:17.939
that was a devastating day.

00:04:17.939 --> 00:04:20.540
So I said, Michael,

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:22.339
the Bible,

00:04:22.339 --> 00:04:24.839
the book from God,

00:04:24.839 --> 00:04:27.540
you don't know.

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.839
Why not study it?

00:04:29.839 --> 00:04:31.139
Why not study that?

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:33.740
Like you study the law books

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.240
or the cases?

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.740
I decided that I would go with her

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.639
on Sunday, on Sunday only,

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:43.839
and only for the first half hour.

00:04:43.839 --> 00:04:46.139
I'd say it was at least a year

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:48.040
that I went to meetings

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.540
with the aim of learning

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:55.240
and refuting it.

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.439
Go for now.

00:04:56.439 --> 00:04:59.740
You see how that relates to the question?

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:01.939
You read that the earth will stay forever,

00:05:01.939 --> 00:05:03.740
that there is no Trinity.

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:05.839
There is a name for God the Father

00:05:05.839 --> 00:05:07.639
and there is no hellfire.

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:09.339
There is no percutory.

00:05:09.339 --> 00:05:10.839
These things were refreshing.

00:05:10.839 --> 00:05:13.939
I was totally convinced.

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:15.740
By October, 1996,

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.040
I wrote my letter to the same priest

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:19.339
who thought it was going to be a miracle

00:05:19.339 --> 00:05:21.040
for me to get my wife out

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:22.839
and inform him that I was withdrawing

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:28.569
from the Catholic faith.

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:31.470
A large part of the transition

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:35.069
that I made was because of the friends

00:05:35.069 --> 00:05:37.569
and the congregation.

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:40.970
I was not a person that you'd want to approach.

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:43.170
But then when I decided to make the change

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:44.769
and he was fast,

00:05:44.769 --> 00:05:47.870
these people never treated me any differently.

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:51.740
Their arms were always open.

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:56.139
Jesus tells us that no one can come to the Father

00:05:56.139 --> 00:05:59.740
unless Jehovah draws that person.

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:06.029
What he saw, I don't know.

00:06:06.029 --> 00:06:10.129
I oftentimes pray to him

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:12.629
and I don't know what to say,

00:06:12.629 --> 00:06:15.329
but I'm deeply appreciative

00:06:15.329 --> 00:06:16.829
of what he's done for me.
