WEBVTT

00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:08.869
Our theme for this month is, you are especially acceptable to Jehovah.

00:00:08.869 --> 00:00:15.990
We love Jehovah and we want to give him our best, but we want our sacrifices to be acceptable

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:23.429
to him, so we may strive to be involved as much as possible in all the exciting things going

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:26.949
on in the organization.

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:29.390
But do you ever feel discouraged?

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:35.549
Perhaps even guilty or frustrated regarding your sacrifices to Jehovah?

00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:42.270
In some cases it may be that you are so involved in so many different aspects of the work

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:49.429
that perhaps you are not giving adequate attention to your spiritual, personal or family needs.

00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:53.869
Or on the other hand, it may be the opposite situation.

00:00:53.869 --> 00:01:00.189
You may have those feelings because you cannot do as much as you'd like to, or as much

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:02.229
as others are doing.

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:08.510
For example, you may have been very involved in the work, but unexpectedly your circumstances

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:14.189
changed because of your health or some other calamity that came along and shut things

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.590
down.

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:24.109
Such feelings may cause us to ask ourselves, what does Jehovah really expect of us?

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:28.750
Well, we're going to consider three points in our discussion.

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.510
The first is, we need to set the right priorities.

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:39.150
Second, do not compare yourselves unfavorably with others.

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.310
And third, remember what's important to Jehovah.

00:01:44.349 --> 00:01:46.750
Let's start with our first point.

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.790
Jehovah expects us to set the right priorities.

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.030
But how can we do that?

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:00.390
Well, a scripture that's helped me is found in 2 Corinthians, chapter 8 and verse 12.

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:06.189
At the time of this letter, the Christians and Judea were facing many trials, and these

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:12.069
trials included famine, persecution, and the plundering of their belongings.

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:14.150
They needed relief.

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:20.990
A previously in his first letter, Paul had encouraged the Corinthians to set aside funds

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.870
to help the brothers in Judea.

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:29.229
Shortly thereafter, when Paul wrote the second inspired letter to the Corinthians, he urged

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:32.590
them to get their gifts ready.

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:39.710
So now with this context of giving, sacrificing, helping others in mind, let's read 2 Corinthians

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:43.629
chapter 8 and verse 12.

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:49.030
For if the readiness is there first, it is especially acceptable, according to what a

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:54.870
person has, not according to what a person does not have.

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:02.349
Paul here is discussing sacrifices that are acceptable, and sacrifices that are unacceptable

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:04.310
to Jehovah.

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:05.710
What's the difference?

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:13.430
Well, picture it this way, picture a young family in Corinth, a father, mother, and children.

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:18.949
The father here is the letter from Paul being read to the congregation, and the father's

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:20.669
very excited.

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:23.150
He wants to help his brothers in Judea.

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:28.669
Now, when the family gets home, he discusses the matter with his wife.

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:34.949
He says, we have a little money that we've set aside to do some work on the house, and

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:38.030
we were saving to purchase another donkey.

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:45.629
However, I'd like to take that money and contribute it for our needy brothers in Jerusalem.

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:47.069
What do you think?

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:51.189
Would you say that is an acceptable sacrifice?

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:54.270
Yes, it's a sacrifice.

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:59.229
He and his family are donating money to help others, but it's according to what the

00:03:59.229 --> 00:04:01.669
family has.

00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:05.750
That sacrifice would no doubt be very precious to Jehovah.

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:12.270
You can picture how excited the family would be to support that decision.

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:16.829
But now let's imagine a different family in the same congregation.

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:23.509
This time, the husband comes home and says, I know we do not have any extra money, but

00:04:23.509 --> 00:04:29.709
I'd like to use the money that we've set aside to feed our family for the next two weeks

00:04:29.709 --> 00:04:34.389
and donate it for the brothers that are in need in Jerusalem.

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:35.910
What do you think now?

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:40.509
Would you say that is an acceptable sacrifice?

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:43.550
It's the same good motive, the same good cause.

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:48.790
It may even be the same amount of money, but is it acceptable?

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:51.509
No, why?

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:54.829
It's not according to what he has.

00:04:54.829 --> 00:04:58.310
Jehovah does not want him to take food away from his children.

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:02.870
Can you imagine him explaining that decision to his family?

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:10.509
If father has a God-given responsibility to feed his family, Paul says, just give according

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:13.430
to what you have.

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:15.550
What's the lesson for us?

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:22.389
How can this help us to maintain balance and set the right priorities?

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:29.389
Well, our sacrifices are acceptable to Jehovah if we give according to what we have, but

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:37.029
our sacrifice would be unacceptable if we try to give beyond what we have.

00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:38.829
How can we apply that?

00:05:38.829 --> 00:05:44.110
Well, there are certain areas that Jehovah says are non-negotiable.

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:46.350
What are some of those areas?

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:50.829
One is our relationship with Jehovah.

00:05:50.829 --> 00:05:56.750
He expects us to keep that relationship strong by making time for such important activities

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:03.029
as lingering in prayer, reading and meditating on God's word, attending and participating

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:08.189
in our meetings and having a meaningful share in the ministry.

00:06:08.189 --> 00:06:16.189
So what we do in the way of work for the organization must never crowd out the spiritual activities

00:06:16.189 --> 00:06:18.430
that keep us close to God.

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:23.589
You see, that would be unacceptable to Jehovah.

00:06:23.589 --> 00:06:26.910
Another example is our family responsibilities.

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:33.189
Jehovah expects us to care for our family, not only materially and physically, but also

00:06:33.189 --> 00:06:35.870
spiritually and emotionally.

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:43.589
So we must spend time together in family worship in the field ministry and in recreation.

00:06:43.589 --> 00:06:50.269
That means that we must not allow our work for the organization to interfere with the necessary

00:06:50.269 --> 00:06:54.310
time we need to care for our family.

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:59.069
That would be unacceptable to Jehovah.

00:06:59.069 --> 00:07:01.870
Another example is our health.

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:05.110
Jehovah expects us to serve him whole soul.

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:09.310
That involves doing all our health allows us to do.

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:16.189
So we do all that we can to maintain our health by eating well, getting enough sleep, exercising

00:07:16.189 --> 00:07:17.189
regularly.

00:07:18.189 --> 00:07:23.949
Well, again, we must not allow our work for the organization to cause us to neglect

00:07:23.949 --> 00:07:25.430
our health.

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:30.069
That would be unacceptable to Jehovah.

00:07:30.069 --> 00:07:34.470
So do you see the point what can help us to set the right priorities?

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:40.509
Well, again, remember the principle here in 2nd Corinthians chapter 8 and verse 12.

00:07:40.509 --> 00:07:47.269
Jehovah in effect says, give to me according to what you have, not according to what you

00:07:47.269 --> 00:07:54.069
do not have, and that will be especially acceptable to me.

00:07:54.069 --> 00:07:58.829
And we know that even though we have set the right priorities, it's still a challenge

00:07:58.829 --> 00:08:00.750
to maintain balance.

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:05.069
A balance is not something that once you have it, you can just lock it in.

00:08:05.069 --> 00:08:13.470
No, it's like a tight rope walker who constantly must recalibrate and adjust to maintain balance.

00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:17.829
The same is true with maintaining balance in our lives.

00:08:17.829 --> 00:08:22.949
I know it's a constant process for me, and I'd guess it's just as challenging for you

00:08:22.949 --> 00:08:25.149
as well.

00:08:25.149 --> 00:08:31.110
We've had excellent articles in our publications that help with managing our time.

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:33.190
Here are two of them.

00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:43.470
The April 2010 awake, page 7, has an article entitled 20 Ways to Create More Time.

00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:51.629
And the February 2014 awake, page 6, how to invest your time wisely.

00:08:51.629 --> 00:08:58.549
You may find these helpful to further research on how to set the right priorities and maintain

00:08:58.549 --> 00:09:01.230
balance.

00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:08.549
A second point to help us maintain balance is, do not compare yourselves unfavorably

00:09:08.549 --> 00:09:10.990
with others.

00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:16.710
There will always be ones doing more in their service to Jehovah than we are.

00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:24.269
And if we start comparing ourselves to them, or feel that they are more acceptable to Jehovah,

00:09:24.269 --> 00:09:30.389
this could cause us to lose not just our balance, but our joy as well.

00:09:30.389 --> 00:09:36.629
And considering this aspect of not comparing, I think of the prophets Daniel Ezekiel and

00:09:36.629 --> 00:09:38.110
Jeremiah.

00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:43.909
As you remember, these men wore contemporaries of one another, but each had very different

00:09:43.909 --> 00:09:46.029
circumstances.

00:09:46.029 --> 00:09:49.870
At Daniel was in the Court of the King in Babylon.

00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:58.750
Yes, he had times of persecution and challenges, but overall, he was an official for the King.

00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:06.669
He received special training for his position, so he may have had it relatively easy.

00:10:06.669 --> 00:10:13.909
Ezekiel was living among his fellow exiles in a community by the River Keybar.

00:10:13.909 --> 00:10:17.669
Overall, things were fairly stable there.

00:10:17.669 --> 00:10:20.269
Remember the Jews in exile had a measure of freedom.

00:10:20.269 --> 00:10:25.389
They built houses, they had children, they settled down, developed skills in various

00:10:25.389 --> 00:10:27.190
trades.

00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:32.990
So it seems, perhaps they had a relatively stable life.

00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:34.429
Then you have Jeremiah.

00:10:34.429 --> 00:10:36.029
He was in Jerusalem.

00:10:36.029 --> 00:10:38.870
It seems somebody was always trying to kill him.

00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:42.990
Much of the time he was either hiding or in confinement.

00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:44.669
So here's the question.

00:10:44.669 --> 00:10:52.190
Did the differing circumstances of their assignments mean that Jehovah loved or favored one more

00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:54.190
than the other?

00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:55.669
Not at all.

00:10:55.669 --> 00:10:58.190
It was just an assignment.

00:10:58.190 --> 00:11:00.990
Jehovah wanted a prophet in Jerusalem.

00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:07.029
He wanted one with the exiles in Babylon and he wanted another in the Court of the King.

00:11:07.029 --> 00:11:10.590
It was just the way the assignments fell.

00:11:10.590 --> 00:11:16.110
Now you can imagine how a counterproductive it would have been for each of these three

00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:24.830
men to judge his value based on his assignment or to compare himself to the other two.

00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:25.830
That could happen.

00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:26.830
Think about it.

00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:34.509
Ezekiel and Jeremiah could have looked at Daniel and thought, oh, he has direct access

00:11:34.509 --> 00:11:36.070
to the King.

00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:38.789
He's living where all the big decisions are being made.

00:11:38.789 --> 00:11:40.950
He's right in the center of it all.

00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:44.990
He can use his influence to help Jehovah's people.

00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:46.389
What a privilege that would be.

00:11:46.389 --> 00:11:49.230
I wish I was there.

00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:56.549
For Daniel and Jeremiah could have looked at Ezekiel and felt that's where they wished

00:11:56.549 --> 00:11:57.990
they were.

00:11:57.990 --> 00:12:02.230
We would have at least relative freedom with the exiles.

00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:06.029
We'd be able to encourage our fellow worshipers of Jehovah.

00:12:06.029 --> 00:12:10.070
We could help others learn about Jehovah.

00:12:10.070 --> 00:12:16.269
Or believe it or not, Daniel and Ezekiel could have looked at Jeremiah and thought, we

00:12:16.269 --> 00:12:20.070
know things are tough, but that's where we want to be.

00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:24.549
He's on the front lines, risking his life for Jehovah and the nation.

00:12:24.549 --> 00:12:28.299
That's where the action is.

00:12:28.299 --> 00:12:33.940
Different assignments, different circumstances, different locations.

00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:37.820
But they were all special to Jehovah.

00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:40.179
What's the lesson?

00:12:40.179 --> 00:12:46.299
The lesson is that we must be careful that we do not compare ourselves unfavorably with

00:12:46.299 --> 00:12:47.299
others.

00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:53.980
It is good to see if we can imitate and benefit from the example of others, but we need

00:12:53.980 --> 00:13:00.379
to be careful that we do not begin determining the value of what we're doing for Jehovah

00:13:00.379 --> 00:13:03.100
based on what others are doing.

00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:09.700
That could cause us to lose our joy, lose our balance, and fall into the trap of doing

00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:12.980
things for the wrong reasons.

00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:15.860
That brings us to our last point.

00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:19.700
Remember what is important to Jehovah.

00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:22.700
Circumstances change in life.

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:28.620
As mentioned in the past, we may have been extremely busy in Jehovah's service, but because

00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:32.700
of the world's situation, that may have changed.

00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:36.940
Or other circumstances in our life may have changed.

00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:40.740
Does that somehow change how Jehovah feels about us?

00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:42.259
No.

00:13:42.259 --> 00:13:43.659
How do we know?

00:13:43.659 --> 00:13:46.259
What is important to Jehovah?

00:13:46.259 --> 00:13:50.179
What makes you especially acceptable to Jehovah?

00:13:50.179 --> 00:13:57.860
Well, let's read together Acts chapter 10 verses 34 and 35.

00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:01.460
At this, Peter began to speak, and he said,

00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:08.539
Now I truly understand that God is not partial, but in every nation the man who fears him

00:14:08.539 --> 00:14:13.100
and does what is right is acceptable to him.

00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:18.340
Do it is right, obey his commandments.

00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:20.019
That's it.

00:14:20.019 --> 00:14:23.860
That's what makes us acceptable to Jehovah.

00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:30.179
We complicate things at times, and equate our responsibilities, how we're used, where

00:14:30.179 --> 00:14:35.379
we're asked to serve, as things that define our value.

00:14:35.379 --> 00:14:38.299
That's not how Jehovah sees things.

00:14:38.299 --> 00:14:46.860
A scripture that has helped me is found in Ecclesiastes chapter 3 and verse 10.

00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:56.139
I have seen the occupation that God has given to the sons of men to keep them occupied.

00:14:56.139 --> 00:15:00.500
The occupation refers to our activities, the things we do.

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:06.700
And Jehovah has given us work to keep us occupied whenever I read that I think of parents

00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:11.059
with their children, perhaps they take them to the beach for the afternoon, and what

00:15:11.059 --> 00:15:12.059
do they do?

00:15:12.059 --> 00:15:15.100
They give them some toys, and they let them play.

00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:16.620
Why?

00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:20.019
To keep them occupied.

00:15:20.019 --> 00:15:23.259
And that in a way is what Jehovah does with us.

00:15:23.259 --> 00:15:27.740
You think about it, Jehovah does not need us to do the work.

00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:33.740
Jehovah can accomplish his work without us, but he dignifies us and allows us to have

00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:34.740
a share.

00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:38.340
He provides us with meaningful work.

00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:44.100
Note what it goes on to say in verse 13 of Ecclesiastes chapter 3.

00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:50.700
Also that everyone should eat and drink and find enjoyment for all his hard work.

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:53.779
It is the gift of God.

00:15:53.779 --> 00:15:56.899
Work is a gift from Jehovah.

00:15:56.899 --> 00:16:03.059
Is it reasonable to think that Jehovah would give a gift that stresses us out or creates

00:16:03.059 --> 00:16:05.059
hardship for us?

00:16:05.059 --> 00:16:06.059
No.

00:16:06.059 --> 00:16:09.340
He wants us to find enjoyment in our work.

00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:15.139
We are the ones that make it to concern with assigning rank and priority to various privileges

00:16:15.139 --> 00:16:22.940
and locations of service, where we are in the sand, and what toys we have to play with.

00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:26.700
What is important to Jehovah?

00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:34.200
Notice our final scripture in Ecclesiastes chapter 12 and verse 13.

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:41.200
The conclusion of the matter, everything having been heard is fear the true God and keep

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:47.399
his commandments for this is the whole obligation of man.

00:16:47.399 --> 00:16:49.200
Fear Jehovah.

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:51.360
Keep his commandments.

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:53.480
Just serve Jehovah.

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:55.679
Do the best that you can.

00:16:55.679 --> 00:16:57.559
Stay balanced.

00:16:57.559 --> 00:17:01.080
Give according to what you have.

00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:03.039
Those are the important things.

00:17:03.039 --> 00:17:09.599
And if you do them, no matter what your personal circumstances, you will remain especially

00:17:09.599 --> 00:17:11.640
acceptable to Jehovah.
