00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:05.459
Our convention theme is so timely.

00:00:05.459 --> 00:00:10.460
The world is full of conflict and anguish.

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:14.460
People long for peace, and they long for unity,

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.460
which is the focus of this month's broadcast.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:25.460
Our theme is, stand together as one united people.

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.460
Let me begin with a question.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.460
Where do you keep your wallet?

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.460
If you're out in public, you brothers likely keep it in your pocket,

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.460
maybe a front pocket, so that it doesn't get lost or stolen.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.460
You sisters might carry your wallet in a purse or handbag,

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.460
which you keep close by your side.

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.460
You guard your wallet, because you know that if you get careless,

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.460
a thief might steal it, and you might never see your wallet

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.460
or its contents again.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:07.459
It is similar with the precious unity we enjoy as Jehovah's people.

00:01:07.459 --> 00:01:13.459
We need to guard it and protect it, or else someone might steal it.

00:01:13.459 --> 00:01:15.459
Make no mistake.

00:01:15.459 --> 00:01:21.459
The devil is looking for an opportunity to steal our unity from us.

00:01:21.459 --> 00:01:25.459
Think about how unique our unity is.

00:01:25.459 --> 00:01:31.459
Unlike other religious organizations, we're not divided into sub-denominations.

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:36.459
We don't have Northern Jehovah's Witnesses, Orthodox Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:01:36.459 --> 00:01:39.459
or Reform Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:46.459
As the Apostle Paul expressed it, we are united in the same mind

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:50.459
and in the same line of thought.

00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:53.459
We are also united internationally.

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:58.459
We don't fight against one another in the wars that divide nations.

00:01:58.459 --> 00:02:01.459
And we are united racially.

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:08.460
Many times, witnesses have risked their lives to protect their fellow Christians of another race

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:15.460
who were being threatened or persecuted because of their racial or ethnic background.

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:18.460
We are also united in our purpose.

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.460
For example, no matter where we live,

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:24.460
we all preach the same good news.

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:30.460
And we all receive the same weekly spiritual instruction.

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:34.460
Can you find this unity out in the world?

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.460
Look around.

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.460
People are divided.

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.460
Nations attack each other.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:44.460
And within nations, political parties fight one another.

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:48.460
Corporations compete with and destroy each other.

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:55.460
And citizens commit racially or ethnically motivated hate crimes against each other.

00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:00.460
What a contrast that is with Jehovah's worshipers.

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:07.460
We stand together as one united people.

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:14.460
Why, though, do we each need to guard and protect our unity?

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:17.460
Can't we safely assume that Jehovah will protect it?

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:22.460
And that he will see to it that our unity is preserved?

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:24.460
Not entirely.

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:31.460
Guarding the unity of God's people is a responsibility that Jehovah has given each one of us.

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:40.460
We must do our part to ensure that we stand together as one united people.

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:42.460
What will happen if we don't?

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:45.460
Divisions will occur among us.

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:49.460
Divisions that resemble what we see in the world.

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:54.460
It happened in the first century congregation in Corinth.

00:03:54.460 --> 00:04:01.460
To them, Paul wrote in 1 Corinthians chapter 1 and verse 11,

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:05.460
there are dissensions among you.

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:08.460
What kind of dissensions?

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:11.460
Some said, I belong to Peter.

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:14.460
Others said, I belong to Paul.

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:18.459
And still others said, I belong to Apollo's.

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:25.459
Paul felt compelled to ask at 1 Corinthians chapter 1 and verse 13,

00:04:25.459 --> 00:04:29.459
is the Christ divided?

00:04:29.459 --> 00:04:34.459
What a reproach on Jehovah's name and on true worship.

00:04:34.459 --> 00:04:40.459
By failing to guard their unity, those early disciples were making Christianity look like

00:04:40.459 --> 00:04:42.459
just another religion.

00:04:42.459 --> 00:04:47.459
Could something like that happen in a congregation today?

00:04:47.459 --> 00:04:53.459
It could happen if individuals cared more about their own personal preferences,

00:04:53.459 --> 00:05:01.459
conveniences, and opinions than they do about the unity of Jehovah's people.

00:05:01.459 --> 00:05:06.459
Selfishness is not the fruitage of Jehovah's spirit.

00:05:06.459 --> 00:05:09.459
Rather, it reflects the spirit of the world.

00:05:09.459 --> 00:05:16.459
The world is aggressively promoting the view that you should put yourself first.

00:05:16.459 --> 00:05:19.459
But we have learned Jehovah's view.

00:05:19.459 --> 00:05:27.459
1 Corinthians chapter 10 verse 24 tells us to keep seeking not our own advantage,

00:05:27.459 --> 00:05:30.459
but that of the other person.

00:05:30.459 --> 00:05:37.459
In chapter 13 verse 5, Paul wrote that love does not look for its own interests.

00:05:37.459 --> 00:05:46.459
And he states at Romans chapter 15 and verse 3 that the Christ did not please himself.

00:05:46.459 --> 00:05:54.459
Therefore, we cannot afford to care more about our privileges, our pride, or our opinions,

00:05:54.459 --> 00:05:57.459
than we do about Christian unity.

00:05:57.459 --> 00:06:05.459
If we put our own wants first, then just like a man who leaves his wallet out in public for a thief to steal,

00:06:05.459 --> 00:06:12.459
we place the congregation's unity in plain view for Satan to snatch.

00:06:12.459 --> 00:06:20.459
And there is no doubt that the devil will seize the opportunity and the congregation will suffer.

00:06:20.459 --> 00:06:28.459
We need to accept our personal responsibility to guard and protect our unity,

00:06:28.459 --> 00:06:34.459
not only as a congregation, but also as field service groups, families,

00:06:34.459 --> 00:06:38.459
married couples, and friends.

00:06:38.459 --> 00:06:48.459
So let's now discuss four areas where we especially need to guard and protect our Christian unity.

00:06:48.459 --> 00:06:55.459
The first is our response to direction from Jehovah's organization.

00:06:55.459 --> 00:07:02.459
When the COVID-19 pandemic struck in 2020, we all received direction,

00:07:02.459 --> 00:07:11.459
including new ways to attend our meetings and carry out our ministry and ways to comply with the secular authorities.

00:07:11.459 --> 00:07:16.459
Did you disagree or did you have a different idea?

00:07:16.459 --> 00:07:23.459
If so, did you follow the direction anyway and give it your support?

00:07:23.459 --> 00:07:28.459
If you did, then you contributed to our unity.

00:07:29.459 --> 00:07:39.459
When we stand together and unitedly follow direction from Jehovah's organization, good things happen.

00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:49.459
Like what? Like what happened when the first century Christians complied with the direction from the apostles and older men in Jerusalem.

00:07:49.459 --> 00:07:53.459
Acts chapter 16 verses 4 and 5 says,

00:07:55.699 --> 00:08:08.699
As they traveled on through the cities, they would deliver to them for observance the decrees that had been decided on by the apostles and the elders who were in Jerusalem.

00:08:08.699 --> 00:08:19.699
Then indeed, the congregations continued to be made firm in the faith and to increase in number day by day.

00:08:19.699 --> 00:08:33.700
Individual Christians and congregations recognized and submitted to the authority of the governing body at that time, the apostles and elders who were in Jerusalem.

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:42.700
Did you note the beneficial results? The congregations continued to be made firm and to increase.

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:49.700
And that's what happened when you, brothers and sisters, follow the direction regarding the COVID-19 pandemic.

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:54.700
We experienced significant increases in meeting attendance.

00:08:54.700 --> 00:09:01.700
The attendance for the 2021 memorial reached an all-time peak.

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:11.700
It is amazing what Jehovah accomplishes when we stand together as one united people.

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:17.700
A secondary in which we need to protect our unity is culture.

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:20.700
Jehovah's organization is diverse.

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:29.700
We love to be introduced to different kinds of food, different styles of dress and interesting customs. How wonderful.

00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:41.700
But what if we started feeling that my race, my tribe, my ethnicity, my culture is superior?

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:45.700
Can you see how that kind of thinking would divide us?

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:54.700
To preserve our unity, we need to focus not on how we are different from one another, but how we are the same.

00:09:54.700 --> 00:10:05.700
We are Jehovah's Witnesses first, not African, Asian, North American, South American or European.

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:12.700
Our people are our spiritual family, our spiritual brothers and sisters.

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:17.700
Our culture is genuine Christianity.

00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:35.700
When we are willing to adopt Jehovah's thinking that we learn from His Word, even setting aside our own personal customs or culture, if necessary, we stand together as one united people.

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:43.700
We experience what the Bible describes at Zephaniah, chapter 3 and verse 9.

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:57.700
For then, I will change the language of the peoples to a pure language so that all of them may call on the name of Jehovah to serve Him shoulder to shoulder.

00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:00.700
How wonderful.

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:04.700
A third area is personality differences.

00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:15.700
Growing up in this divided world, we may have absorbed some of its sensitivities, but Ecclesiastes, chapter 7 and verse 9 says,

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:20.700
Do not be quick to take offense.

00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:33.700
If a fellow Christian hurts our feelings, we have a special opportunity and obligation to show that we stand together as one united people.

00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:36.700
How can we do that?

00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:59.139
And forgiving one another freely, even if anyone has a cause for a complaint against another, just as Jehovah freely forgave you, you must also do the same.

00:12:00.139 --> 00:12:14.139
Some imperfections and slights are so small, do they really require formal forgiveness?

00:12:14.139 --> 00:12:19.139
Because of our human imperfection, we need to do what Paul says.

00:12:19.139 --> 00:12:23.139
We have to learn to just put up with them.

00:12:23.139 --> 00:12:36.139
For example, maybe a certain family did not include us in a gathering at their home or a brother failed to greet us in the kingdom hall or call on us to give a comment at the meeting.

00:12:36.139 --> 00:12:44.139
These things may irritate us or even hurt our feelings, but they are not sins that we need to forgive.

00:12:45.139 --> 00:12:52.139
They are mere slights or imperfections that we need to learn to put up with.

00:12:52.139 --> 00:13:05.139
On the other hand, if a fellow Christian has actually sinned against us in some way, giving us a genuine cause for complaint, what does the scripture encourage us to do?

00:13:05.139 --> 00:13:08.139
Forgive one another freely.

00:13:08.139 --> 00:13:13.139
That is what Jehovah does for you and for me.

00:13:13.139 --> 00:13:23.139
Putting up with and forgiving one another is vital if we are to stand together as one united people.

00:13:23.139 --> 00:13:29.139
Our fourth area is how we respond when our brothers are in distress.

00:13:29.139 --> 00:13:39.139
While coping with the COVID-19 pandemic, numerous lands were hit by other disasters, hurricanes, volcanoes, fires.

00:13:40.139 --> 00:13:53.139
But our brothers also experience other forms of distress like the effects of old age, the loss of a loved one in death, chronic health problems, and the list goes on and on.

00:13:53.139 --> 00:14:00.139
What do Jehovah's Witnesses do when we see our brothers in distress?

00:14:00.139 --> 00:14:10.139
We immediately come to their aid. We stand together in this very selfish and divided world.

00:14:10.139 --> 00:14:15.139
This is not a small thing.

00:14:15.139 --> 00:14:19.139
It is not something to take for granted.

00:14:19.139 --> 00:14:34.139
Jesus said at John 13 verses 34 and 35 that this deep, unselfish love in action would identify his true disciples.

00:14:34.139 --> 00:14:43.139
Therefore, brothers and sisters, as we work hard to stand together in the four areas that we have discussed,

00:14:43.139 --> 00:14:51.139
we give powerful evidence that we are true disciples of Christ Jesus.

00:14:51.139 --> 00:14:55.139
Jesus knew that unity was vital.

00:14:55.139 --> 00:15:02.139
On the night before he was put to death, he was concerned that his disciples would remain united.

00:15:02.139 --> 00:15:10.139
He prayed at John chapter 17 and verses 20 to 22.

00:15:11.139 --> 00:15:36.139
I make requests, not concerning these only, but also concerning those putting faith in me through their word, so that they may all be one, just as you father are in union with me, and I am in union with you, that they also may be in union with us, so that the world may believe that you sent me.

00:15:36.139 --> 00:15:47.139
I have given them the glory that you have given me in order that they may be one, just as we are one.

00:15:47.139 --> 00:15:51.139
Obviously, Jehovah answered that prayer.

00:15:51.139 --> 00:15:57.139
He is teaching us to stand together as one united people.

00:15:57.139 --> 00:16:16.139
Therefore, dear brothers and sisters, let us renew our determination to protect our Christian unity by following direction from Jehovah's organization, by valuing Jehovah's thinking more than our own culture,

00:16:16.139 --> 00:16:25.139
by putting up with and forgiving one another freely, and by helping one another in times of distress.

00:16:25.139 --> 00:16:39.139
By doing so, we will not allow Satan to steal our precious unity. Instead, we will stand together as one united people.
