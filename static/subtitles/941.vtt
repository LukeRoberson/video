00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:19.539
And every morning, and I mean every morning, there's Jeremy singing at the top of his lungs.

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:21.019
Okay, I wasn't the only one.

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:23.940
No, but you were the loudest.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.780
Spoken like a true big brother.

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:31.460
I was always impressed with how close you two were.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.420
Well, it wasn't always that way.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.420
No.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.420
I mean, it started out that way.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.420
Nick and I, we weren't just brothers.

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.729
We were friends.

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:50.729
But then the family business ran into trouble.

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:55.729
And what started as a small disagreement just exploded.

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:59.420
How are business works?

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.420
Instead of criticizing, could you just once?

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:05.420
Jeremy!

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.670
Do you have any idea what this is going to cost us?

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:10.670
I didn't have a choice.

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:11.670
You went behind my back.

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.670
What's your problem?

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.670
You, you're the problem.

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:30.579
We tried to work it out.

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:35.359
But things just got worse.

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:38.359
It was like a door slam shut between us.

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:42.359
On the outside, I acted like everything was fine.

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:45.359
But inside, I couldn't let it go.

00:01:45.359 --> 00:02:20.460
I felt like a total hypocrite, and that had to change.

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:30.509
I needed a lot of help from Jehovah to let go, to move on,

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:36.509
and make things right with Nick.

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:41.229
It took a long time for the wounds to heal.

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:51.860
And for us to trust each other, the way we used to.

00:02:51.860 --> 00:03:00.659
But we did.

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:20.289
I'm so grateful that we made peace before the world turned upside down.

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:27.729
You see, pandemic lasted longer than any of us expected.

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:32.729
And all the conflicting news reports just added to the stress.

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:36.729
Then my sister lost her job and had to move in with us.

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:45.039
So yeah, it was me and Kelly, Nicole, and Dad.

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:47.039
Twenty seconds, son.

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:49.039
Twenty seconds.

00:03:49.039 --> 00:04:01.439
Where's your mask?

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:02.439
Don't worry.

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:03.439
Here.

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:05.439
You can use this one.

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:06.439
I won't get near anyone.

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:08.439
Gary!

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:12.439
Listen, nobody at the warehouse is wearing masks.

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:15.439
And do you know how many people have actually gotten sick?

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:17.439
Zero.

00:04:17.439 --> 00:04:19.439
So far.

00:04:19.439 --> 00:04:21.439
You saw the last governing body update.

00:04:21.439 --> 00:04:24.439
We can't let down our guard.

00:04:24.439 --> 00:04:25.439
Dad?

00:04:25.439 --> 00:04:27.439
I get it, okay?

00:04:27.439 --> 00:04:32.980
Look, I think it's great that the brothers are trying to keep us safe.

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:34.980
But...

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:36.980
But what?

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:57.079
Don't you think that they're, you know, overreacting?

00:04:57.079 --> 00:05:04.060
But of course, it wasn't the brothers who had the problem.

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:05.060
It was me.

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:13.490
A week later, I found out that a friend in our service group was in the hospital with COVID-19.

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.860
He was young.

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:20.660
And he'd been taking all the rape precautions.

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:22.660
I had really let my guard down.

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:36.540
No, it's not the time to slacken our hand when it comes to safety.

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:39.540
Don't let your guard down.

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:44.860
Don't think the virus can't affect you or your family.

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:48.860
I saw how the organization was really trying to protect us.

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:57.899
And how much my decisions were affecting others, including the people I love the most.

00:05:57.899 --> 00:06:06.560
As the pandemic dragged on, I learned the importance of being humble and obedient.

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:15.259
Following Jehovah's direction didn't just help us stay safe.

00:06:15.259 --> 00:06:21.009
It brought us peace.

00:06:21.009 --> 00:06:38.819
Oh, how Jehovah's people are.

00:06:38.819 --> 00:06:43.819
When there's a need, our brothers step up.

00:06:43.819 --> 00:06:50.819
So even though we had a lot of work to do back then, we always had willing workers.

00:06:50.819 --> 00:07:01.500
So many workers that some started to feel like they were being overlooked.

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:03.500
Hey, Ray, what's up?

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:07.500
Hey, Matt, I hear you're organizing the food distribution for our congregation.

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:09.500
Yeah, try my best.

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:11.500
Yeah, well, can I give you a hand?

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:13.500
My truck's all ready to go.

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:18.500
We actually finished just loading up for the day, so I think we're good.

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:21.500
But wow, yeah, thank you very much for offering.

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:25.500
Okay, when's the next run?

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:27.500
You know what, Ray, we're about to pull out right now.

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:29.500
Is it okay if I call you back?

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:31.500
Yeah, yeah, sure.

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:39.360
Ray was such a hard worker.

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:42.360
More than most of us even realized.

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:45.360
He put his heart into every assignment.

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:50.959
But when I told him we already had all the help we needed,

00:07:50.959 --> 00:07:52.959
it didn't go the way I helped.

00:07:52.959 --> 00:07:54.959
Ray, I think you're muted.

00:07:54.959 --> 00:08:02.420
So what you're saying is you don't think I'm qualified to help out?

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:04.420
No, no, we just...

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:07.420
We know how hard you're working caring for your mom.

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:08.420
We didn't want to...

00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:10.420
Is Paul Thompson on your crew?

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:11.420
Yeah, but...

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:12.420
And Oliver Kagan.

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:14.420
Oliver's my assistant, yes.

00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:16.420
So how does this work, Matt?

00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:20.420
I mean, you just use your friends and you shut the rest of us out.

00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:24.420
Don't you think I noticed how your brothers ignore me?

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:31.829
Ray, are we even apology?

00:08:31.829 --> 00:08:35.850
I'm so sorry.

00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:42.110
I should have spoke with you about this right from the start.

00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:45.110
You're working so hard taking care of your mom.

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:49.110
The last thing we wanted to do was make things harder for you.

00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:51.110
But even more than that.

00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:54.110
We didn't want to have to ask you to do something

00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:59.159
that would put you or your mother at higher risk.

00:08:59.159 --> 00:09:00.159
I know.

00:09:00.159 --> 00:09:04.110
I worry about that, too.

00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:06.110
Your mom?

00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:08.110
We wouldn't want anything to happen to her.

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:11.110
She's one of our congregation treasures.

00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:13.110
I know.

00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:16.110
And you're not so bad, either.

00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:20.110
Seriously, you're such a good example.

00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:26.110
And think how Jehovah must feel when he sees all that you're doing.

00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:28.110
For us and for your mom.

00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:31.870
Thank you.

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:33.870
That means a lot to me.

00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:36.870
If something comes up that I can't help with then,

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:39.870
even just a little, and I can do it from home.

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:55.070
And later on, when things got even more intense,

00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:59.070
that's when our peace was really put to the test.

00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:05.070
Yeah, but Tim, you always found a way to keep us positive.

00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:10.070
Well, I learned a lot about that from my better half.

00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:13.070
Amy's always had a way of bringing people together.

00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:16.070
For example, just before the pandemic,

00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:19.070
there were these two pioneer sisters in our congregation.

00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:25.070
Becky was energetic, industrious, and fearless in her ministry.

00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:29.070
And Lena experienced self-sacrificing

00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:32.070
and such a good Bible teacher.

00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:35.070
But they didn't exactly get along.

00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:52.340
You ready to go?

00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:54.340
Are you okay?

00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:56.340
It's just, it's Becky.

00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:59.340
She's just such a phantom pioneer.

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:01.340
We never see her.

00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:03.340
I'm sorry, but she just needs me.

00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:05.340
We're serious about her ministry.

00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:07.340
Oh, she's been doing metro witnessing.

00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:09.340
I know, I know, an LDC, too, right?

00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:11.340
She does plumbing.

00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:13.340
Concrete.

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:17.340
She does have a lot of energy.

00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:19.340
I remember when we used to be like that.

00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:22.340
Oh, I don't know that I was ever like Becky.

00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:23.340
No, you weren't.

00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:25.340
You were Becky or the Becky.

00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:27.340
I couldn't keep up with you.

00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:30.340
She feels long service days in your little red car.

00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:32.340
That feels like a long time ago.

00:11:37.139 --> 00:11:41.139
You know, Becky reminds me a lot of you.

00:11:41.139 --> 00:11:43.139
I mean, both of us.

00:11:43.139 --> 00:11:45.139
20 years ago.

00:11:45.139 --> 00:11:47.139
She's working so hard,

00:11:47.139 --> 00:11:51.139
and she's made so many sacrifices for the truth.

00:11:51.139 --> 00:11:53.139
Just like you have.

00:11:53.139 --> 00:11:56.379
I think we should get together.

00:11:56.379 --> 00:11:58.379
The three of us.

00:11:58.379 --> 00:12:04.929
You should get to know her better.

00:12:04.929 --> 00:12:09.929
The next week, I had them both over to the house.

00:12:09.929 --> 00:12:13.929
And the more those two got to know each other,

00:12:13.929 --> 00:12:15.929
the closer they became.

00:12:15.929 --> 00:12:19.620
You know that proverb,

00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:22.620
the tongue of the wise is a healing?

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:27.450
Amy taught me what that verse really means.

00:12:27.450 --> 00:12:30.450
Okay, everyone out.

00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:38.820
When everything changed,

00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:42.820
and we suddenly found ourselves locked up together,

00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:45.820
I tried to show that same spirit

00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:57.460
so that we could stay united.

00:12:57.460 --> 00:12:59.460
And with Jehovah's help,

00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:11.659
we did.

00:13:11.659 --> 00:13:13.659
The first time we met David,

00:13:13.659 --> 00:13:15.659
we were in chains.

00:13:15.659 --> 00:13:18.659
I'd seen a lot of things during my time as a guard,

00:13:18.659 --> 00:13:24.100
but nothing like the peace that you all had.

00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:26.100
Prison chains may be strong,

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:30.100
but we all had something much stronger.

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:33.100
We had to work for that peace.

00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:35.100
Right, Phil?

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:37.100
That's right.

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:42.100
See, there was a misunderstanding.

00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:46.799
That got blown all out of proportion,

00:13:46.799 --> 00:13:49.799
and I didn't handle it the best.

00:13:49.799 --> 00:13:52.799
The more I tried to defend myself,

00:13:52.799 --> 00:13:55.799
the worse it became.

00:13:55.799 --> 00:13:59.799
Brothers, there must be some mistake.

00:13:59.799 --> 00:14:09.230
This isn't true. You know me.

00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:12.230
I wasn't prepared for how far I would go.

00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:14.230
There's one more announcement.

00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:19.230
Brother Philip Kim is no longer serving as an elder.

00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:24.110
That brings our meeting to you.

00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:28.940
The next few months were a real struggle.

00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:30.940
But when more details came to light,

00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:32.940
I thought I'd be reappointed,

00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:43.320
but I wasn't.

00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:46.320
I couldn't understand why.

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:47.320
Phil, come on.

00:14:47.320 --> 00:15:02.039
I felt bitterness growing inside.

00:15:02.039 --> 00:15:05.039
Everything became about me,

00:15:05.039 --> 00:15:09.039
how I felt, what I deserved.

00:15:09.039 --> 00:15:12.039
It was like a fog that stopped me

00:15:12.039 --> 00:15:14.039
from seeing what Jehovah deserved.

00:15:14.039 --> 00:15:17.350
I really needed his help.

00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:23.370
I found comfort in accounts of Jehovah's servants

00:15:23.370 --> 00:15:28.370
who were either misunderstood or misjudged,

00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:38.149
but maintained their loyalty to him.

00:15:38.149 --> 00:15:42.149
They helped me realize that it's a privilege

00:15:42.149 --> 00:15:45.149
just to be in Jehovah's organization.

00:15:45.149 --> 00:15:48.149
Being a peace with my brothers

00:15:48.149 --> 00:15:53.149
was more important than any appointed position.

00:15:53.149 --> 00:15:55.149
Without peace,

00:15:55.149 --> 00:15:58.149
I don't know how we could have managed what was to come.

00:15:58.149 --> 00:16:10.940
Our threat is fat today.

00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:12.940
And I'll be your secretary.

00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:14.940
That's like Barrick was the Jeremiah.

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:18.190
I don't know what I'd do without you.

00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:33.639
But you know there's more to the story?

00:16:33.639 --> 00:16:36.639
Phil didn't know just how tense things were

00:16:36.639 --> 00:16:38.639
between Tim and I.

00:16:38.639 --> 00:16:41.639
No idea.

00:16:41.639 --> 00:16:43.639
We never talked.

00:16:43.639 --> 00:16:46.639
I mean, really talked about it

00:16:46.639 --> 00:16:48.639
until it was too late.

00:16:48.639 --> 00:17:08.440
Look, we need to talk.

00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:11.440
I think we need to seriously reconsider Phil's qualifications.

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:14.440
You know he's not the type of brother that was enough.

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:16.440
Enough about Phil.

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:17.440
I know he's your friend.

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:18.440
Friend.

00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:19.440
But the body agreed that friend

00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:20.440
had longer qualified to serve.

00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:22.440
Friend?

00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:24.440
He's worked with us for years.

00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:28.440
The body decided unanimously that he should no longer serve.

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:30.440
You pushed them.

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:34.029
Excuse me?

00:17:34.029 --> 00:17:37.029
It's enough that we have those outside the congregation

00:17:37.029 --> 00:17:38.029
putting pressure on us.

00:17:38.029 --> 00:17:39.029
We do not need more in here.

00:17:39.029 --> 00:17:40.029
It's a seriously thing.

00:17:40.029 --> 00:17:44.880
The conversation.

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:45.880
The argument.

00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:48.880
It was terrible.

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:52.190
We both said things we didn't mean.

00:17:52.190 --> 00:18:13.539
And after that we both handled the situation poorly.

00:18:13.539 --> 00:18:34.990
We needed to make things right.

00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:35.990
It wasn't easy.

00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:41.609
But we talked it out.

00:18:41.609 --> 00:18:43.609
And we made peace.

00:18:43.609 --> 00:18:49.059
But your hope is help.

00:18:49.059 --> 00:18:51.059
Can you imagine what it would have been like in that cell block

00:18:51.059 --> 00:18:53.059
if we hadn't?

00:18:53.059 --> 00:18:56.059
We finally told Phil the whole story.

00:18:56.059 --> 00:18:58.059
Once we were all roommates.

00:18:58.059 --> 00:18:59.059
Wow.

00:18:59.059 --> 00:19:04.220
That's cool.

00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:07.430
Sing.

00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:09.430
Our stormy seas.

00:19:09.430 --> 00:19:19.220
God's people are live with our eyes.

00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:22.220
We see beyond the clouds.

00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:26.220
And know that the storm soon will see.

00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:49.569
There's one more story to tell.

00:19:49.569 --> 00:19:53.980
I didn't know it at the time.

00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:57.980
But seeds of truth were being planted in my heart.

00:19:57.980 --> 00:20:07.599
You were also different.

00:20:07.599 --> 00:20:14.529
I couldn't understand it.

00:20:14.529 --> 00:20:15.529
You were prisoners.

00:20:15.529 --> 00:20:16.529
Yes.

00:20:16.529 --> 00:20:18.529
But you felt free.

00:20:18.529 --> 00:20:25.259
Truly free.

00:20:25.259 --> 00:20:33.299
After you were released.

00:20:33.299 --> 00:20:35.299
It became clear to me.

00:20:35.299 --> 00:20:37.299
You have God's blessing.

00:20:37.299 --> 00:20:40.859
And I wanted to know why.

00:20:40.859 --> 00:20:46.740
Phil, help me find the answer.

00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:51.410
And you will know the truth.

00:20:51.410 --> 00:20:54.410
And the truth will set you free.

00:20:54.410 --> 00:21:00.579
Phil encouraged me to make the truth my own.

00:21:00.579 --> 00:21:04.829
I had real trouble at first.

00:21:04.829 --> 00:21:07.829
With all the turmoil going on at the time.

00:21:07.829 --> 00:21:10.829
The idea of being peaceable.

00:21:10.829 --> 00:21:16.170
And waiting on God's kingdom.

00:21:16.170 --> 00:21:25.049
It was hard to grasp.

00:21:25.049 --> 00:21:29.450
But with Jehovah's help.

00:21:29.450 --> 00:21:33.269
And the patience of these good people.

00:21:33.269 --> 00:21:36.269
I was baptized before the start of the Great Tribulation.

00:21:36.269 --> 00:21:49.650
Joseph, during our time in prison.

00:21:49.650 --> 00:21:51.650
The story of your life.

00:21:52.650 --> 00:21:54.650
And how Jehovah was always with you.

00:21:54.650 --> 00:21:58.650
Became a real source of strength for us.

00:21:58.650 --> 00:22:00.650
I remember one day.

00:22:00.650 --> 00:22:03.650
Carl said.

00:22:03.650 --> 00:22:05.650
What did you say?

00:22:05.650 --> 00:22:09.650
I said, one day we'll have a meal with Joseph.

00:22:09.650 --> 00:22:12.650
And we'll say, thank you.

00:22:12.650 --> 00:22:15.650
And here we are.

00:22:15.650 --> 00:22:16.650
Really.

00:22:16.650 --> 00:22:18.650
It's I who should thank you.

00:22:19.650 --> 00:22:22.650
Each and every one of your stories.

00:22:22.650 --> 00:22:24.650
Touches my heart.

00:22:24.650 --> 00:22:27.650
You know a lot about my life.

00:22:27.650 --> 00:22:30.650
But would it be alright if I shared a few more stories?

00:22:30.650 --> 00:22:31.650
Please.

00:22:31.650 --> 00:22:33.650
We have so many questions.

00:22:33.650 --> 00:22:34.650
Can you tell us about Egypt?

00:22:34.650 --> 00:22:35.650
What was very real like?

00:22:35.650 --> 00:22:36.650
Dreams.

00:22:36.650 --> 00:22:39.650
We got to talk about those dreams.

00:22:39.650 --> 00:22:43.650
You do have many questions.

00:22:43.650 --> 00:22:46.650
And I have many details to share.

00:22:46.650 --> 00:22:48.650
And thanks to our God, Jehovah.

00:22:48.650 --> 00:22:51.650
We have all the time we need.
