00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:05.330
Invitation really is built into human nature.

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:09.330
It's one of our most used and powerful learning tools.

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.330
I mean, think of all the things that you've learned by imitation,

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.329
even just think of the current work assignment you have or your job.

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:21.329
How much of it did you learn by just watching someone else do that work?

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:26.329
Children imitate their parents when they learn how to speak, think, eat,

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:28.329
and even walk just like them.

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:32.329
Children even learn to imitate the very subtle accents of their parents

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:36.329
and those accents get passed on from one generation to the next.

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.329
I've had people say to me,

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:40.329
John, you walk just like your father.

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:42.329
I have no idea how that happened.

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.899
Sometimes we imitate others

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.899
and we don't even know that we're doing it.

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.899
I've ever been listening to the radio

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:54.899
and a few hours later you're humming or singing a song

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.899
and you realize that that was the very song that was on the radio

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.899
several hours ago.

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.900
Imitation is such a part of the human learning experience

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.900
that we're doing it all the time.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.900
We can't turn it off.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.900
Imitation is also used by animals to learn their skills by watching their parents.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.900
I saw the cutest example of this when we were watching a herd of elephants in Zambia

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.900
and the mother elephant and the baby elephant were walking by

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.900
and the baby elephant was trying to grab some grass

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.900
and tear it off and put it in his mouth like his mother was.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.900
But every time he did it, he ended up with nothing.

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.900
But he was sure watching his mom how she was doing it

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.900
and seeing how he could imitate and get some of that for himself.

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.900
Well, since imitation is such a powerful learning tool

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.900
and has such an effect on the person we are

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.900
and the person that we are to become,

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.900
we need to be very careful about who we choose to imitate.

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.900
Who do you choose to imitate?

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.900
We'll see who we choose to imitate determines who we want to become.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.900
That's why there's so much caution in the scriptures about our association

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:14.900
because who we choose to imitate rubs off on us, so to speak

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.900
in subtle ways that we might not even notice right away.

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.900
Notice the counsel given to the Israelites

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.900
about not imitating the nations around them.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.900
If you look at Exodus chapter 23 and verse 24,

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.900
notice the counsel that Jehovah gave to the Israelites.

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.900
He said, you must not bow down to their gods

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.900
or be persuaded to serve them

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.900
and you must not imitate their practices.

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.900
And he continues this thought in Deuteronomy chapter 18 and verse 9,

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:55.729
Deuteronomy 18, verse 9,

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:57.729
it says, when you have entered into the land

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:59.729
that Jehovah your God is giving you,

00:02:59.729 --> 00:03:04.729
you must not learn to imitate the detestable practices

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:06.729
of those nations.

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:09.729
Well, what happened when the Israelites chose

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:11.729
to imitate the nations around them,

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:14.729
to ignore the advice Jehovah had given them?

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:18.729
Well, let's look at 2 Kings chapter 17, verse 15.

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:28.139
2 Kings 17, 15.

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:31.139
Does they continued rejecting his regulations and his covenant

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:33.139
that he had made with their forefathers

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:36.139
and his reminders that he had given to warn them

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:39.139
and they kept following worthless idols.

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:41.139
And notice what happened to them when they did that

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:44.139
and became worthless themselves.

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:46.139
Imitating the nations all around them

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:50.139
that Jehovah had commanded them not to imitate.

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:53.139
So if we imitate worthless things,

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:57.139
what's going to happen to us, we're going to be worthless.

00:03:57.139 --> 00:03:59.139
If we fast forward to Christian times,

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:03.139
we can see that the same advice was given to us.

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:10.710
If we look at 3 John and verse 11,

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:12.710
very straightforward advice.

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:16.709
Beloved one, do not imitate what is bad,

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.709
but imitate what is good.

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.709
The one who does good originates with God.

00:04:22.709 --> 00:04:25.709
The one who does bad has not seen God.

00:04:25.709 --> 00:04:27.709
The message is clear.

00:04:27.709 --> 00:04:31.709
If we want to see God or have a good relationship with Jehovah,

00:04:31.709 --> 00:04:34.709
then we need to imitate what is good.

00:04:34.709 --> 00:04:37.709
And our text for today in Ephesians chapter 5 and verse 1

00:04:37.709 --> 00:04:41.709
really says it about as simply and clearly as we can,

00:04:41.709 --> 00:04:44.709
become imitators of God.

00:04:44.709 --> 00:04:47.709
So Jehovah is telling us in our text for today,

00:04:47.709 --> 00:04:49.709
imitate me.

00:04:49.709 --> 00:04:52.709
So someone asks us, who do you choose to imitate?

00:04:52.709 --> 00:04:56.709
In the case of Ephesians 5, 1, we want to imitate Jehovah.

00:04:56.709 --> 00:04:59.709
Well, how can we imitate Jehovah?

00:04:59.709 --> 00:05:03.709
Well, first one way is by reading the Bible.

00:05:03.709 --> 00:05:07.709
We have learned love, hope, faith, loyalty,

00:05:07.709 --> 00:05:09.709
and so many other fine qualities

00:05:09.709 --> 00:05:13.709
by reading about how Jehovah wants us to conduct ourselves.

00:05:13.709 --> 00:05:17.709
I mean, look at the law that Jehovah gave to the nation of Israel.

00:05:17.709 --> 00:05:21.709
We can learn so much about how Jehovah feels about being honest,

00:05:21.709 --> 00:05:24.709
clean, fair, just.

00:05:24.709 --> 00:05:26.709
Or in different Bible examples,

00:05:26.709 --> 00:05:30.709
we see Jehovah's patience in dealing with Jonah

00:05:30.709 --> 00:05:34.709
and his mercy in dealing with the Ninevites.

00:05:34.709 --> 00:05:37.709
Reading the Bible gives us a very clear picture

00:05:37.709 --> 00:05:39.709
of our perfect God, Jehovah, we worship,

00:05:39.709 --> 00:05:43.709
and he gives us the perfect role model to imitate.

00:05:43.709 --> 00:05:46.709
When we read the Bible and continually ask ourselves,

00:05:46.709 --> 00:05:48.709
what do I learn about Jehovah

00:05:48.709 --> 00:05:51.709
and how can I learn to imitate him,

00:05:51.709 --> 00:05:54.709
that really is like us keeping our eye on Jehovah

00:05:54.709 --> 00:05:57.709
with our minds eye and watching what he's doing

00:05:57.709 --> 00:06:00.709
and we're imitating him.

00:06:00.709 --> 00:06:02.709
Another way that we can imitate Jehovah

00:06:02.709 --> 00:06:05.709
is by imitating others who are imitating him.

00:06:05.709 --> 00:06:07.709
Jehovah's use the pages of the Bible

00:06:07.709 --> 00:06:11.709
to give us real life stories of people that we can imitate.

00:06:11.709 --> 00:06:14.709
I mean, we've never met Abraham and Sarah,

00:06:14.709 --> 00:06:16.709
but don't you feel like you know them?

00:06:16.709 --> 00:06:18.709
Sure, there's much more that we can learn

00:06:18.709 --> 00:06:21.709
about these beautiful spiritual people in the New World,

00:06:21.709 --> 00:06:24.709
but what is laid out in the scriptures is enough

00:06:24.709 --> 00:06:28.709
for us to imitate the beautiful examples they set for us.

00:06:28.709 --> 00:06:30.709
Or what about Jesus?

00:06:30.709 --> 00:06:32.709
We've never met Jesus.

00:06:32.709 --> 00:06:34.709
But by reading the Bible accounts,

00:06:34.709 --> 00:06:36.709
don't you feel like you know him

00:06:36.709 --> 00:06:38.709
and that you know how he would react

00:06:38.709 --> 00:06:41.709
and think about certain situations?

00:06:41.709 --> 00:06:44.709
The Apostle Paul simply explained this

00:06:44.709 --> 00:06:47.709
in 1 Corinthians 111,

00:06:47.709 --> 00:06:51.709
he said, become imitators of me as I am of Christ.

00:06:51.709 --> 00:06:55.709
So we have Jesus Christ as an example of imitating his father.

00:06:55.709 --> 00:06:58.709
The Apostle Paul was imitating Christ.

00:06:58.709 --> 00:07:00.709
Now, the Apostle Paul, of course, wasn't saying,

00:07:00.709 --> 00:07:03.709
imitate the way I give my talks, imitate the way I move,

00:07:03.709 --> 00:07:06.709
imitate the way I walk or say things.

00:07:06.709 --> 00:07:10.709
But in Hebrews chapter 13 and verse 7,

00:07:10.709 --> 00:07:15.709
he stressed what it was that we were to imitate about others.

00:07:15.709 --> 00:07:19.709
Hebrews 13, 7, remember those who were taking the lead among you

00:07:19.709 --> 00:07:22.709
who have spoken the word of God to you

00:07:22.709 --> 00:07:26.709
and as you contemplate how their conduct turns out,

00:07:26.709 --> 00:07:29.709
imitate their faith.

00:07:29.709 --> 00:07:32.709
So we are to imitate the faith,

00:07:32.709 --> 00:07:35.709
an example that others set in imitating Jesus

00:07:35.709 --> 00:07:39.709
and imitating Jehovah.

00:07:39.709 --> 00:07:42.709
Now, to illustrate the choice that we have

00:07:42.709 --> 00:07:44.709
of who we're going to imitate,

00:07:44.709 --> 00:07:47.709
I'd like you to imagine in your mind two big, huge machines

00:07:47.709 --> 00:07:49.709
with lots of parts.

00:07:49.709 --> 00:07:53.709
Now, one machine is run by Jehovah in Jesus Christ

00:07:53.709 --> 00:07:57.709
and the other machine is run by Satan and the world.

00:07:57.709 --> 00:08:01.709
And I want to imagine that you're a part on the mechanics bench.

00:08:01.709 --> 00:08:04.709
When Jehovah goes to pick you up and look at you

00:08:04.709 --> 00:08:08.709
and see, do you fit as a part

00:08:08.709 --> 00:08:11.709
in his organization?

00:08:11.709 --> 00:08:15.709
Well, we can, if we imitate him and other spiritual people

00:08:15.709 --> 00:08:17.709
who are useful to Jehovah,

00:08:17.709 --> 00:08:23.709
we can become a useful part of his beautiful organization.

00:08:23.709 --> 00:08:26.709
If we imitate Jehovah, then Satan,

00:08:26.709 --> 00:08:29.709
if he goes over to that bench and picks it up

00:08:29.709 --> 00:08:31.709
and tries to put it into his machine,

00:08:31.709 --> 00:08:33.710
it's not going to fit anywhere.

00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:37.710
We are no part of his world or organization.

00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:40.710
I mean, how sad it would be if we shaped

00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:43.710
and imitated ourselves after the world

00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:46.710
and when Satan picked us up, we fit right in

00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:50.710
with his machine and organization.

00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:52.710
So, who do you choose to imitate?

00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:55.710
We choose to imitate Jehovah.

00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:59.710
We want to be just like him when we grow up.

00:08:59.710 --> 00:09:02.710
How can we imitate Jehovah

00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:06.710
by getting to know him personally through reading the Bible

00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:10.710
and imitating others that are imitating him?
