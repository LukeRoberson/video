00:00:02.859 --> 00:00:08.859
It's dark outside to start the day

00:00:08.859 --> 00:00:14.859
She humbly starts to pray for her kids at school

00:00:14.859 --> 00:00:18.859
And they bother who

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:22.859
Father help us be faithful

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.859
When things make it hard to go

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:31.859
She never thinks of losing home

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.859
Never stops being kind in that song

00:00:36.859 --> 00:00:39.859
It's always on my mind

00:00:39.859 --> 00:00:44.429
I will make you strong

00:00:44.429 --> 00:01:08.969
Ages and strong it's own

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:37.060
True friends out there

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.060
Oh, she never needs to

00:01:39.060 --> 00:02:28.710
She'll swirl in the sky

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:33.409
Oh, she plays so little time

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:36.879
Each day

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:49.699
What she starts to pray

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:59.509
And she can find in that song

00:02:59.509 --> 00:03:44.900
Who's strong and cute
