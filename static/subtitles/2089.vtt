00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:10.699
To advance true worship and spread the good news, Jehovah's people must build.

00:00:10.699 --> 00:00:15.820
Theocratic building projects strengthen our faith and feed our hope.

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.320
How?

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:31.210
Let's see in this episode of Our History in Motion.

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.810
In ancient times, Nehemiah was moved to exclaim,

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:38.409
the good hand of my God was upon me.

00:00:38.409 --> 00:00:46.729
Yes, against daunting odds, Jehovah provided what was needed at the right time to advance pure worship.

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:50.409
The same has proved true in modern times.

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:53.729
As the significant year 1914 approached,

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:59.369
the Bible students, as we were then called, prepared for an all-out preaching campaign

00:00:59.369 --> 00:01:04.170
to publicize the long hope for fulfillment of Bible prophecy.

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:12.370
So in 1909, C.T. Russell moved world headquarters from Pennsylvania to Brooklyn, New York.

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:18.090
Two newly purchased and renovated buildings, renamed Bethel and the Brooklyn Tabernacle,

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.090
accommodated the increased workload.

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:27.489
At the time, though, some thought the preaching work would end with the birth of the kingdom in 1914.

00:01:27.489 --> 00:01:32.409
Little did they realize how much work remained to be done.

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.170
Opposition to the kingdom worked sparked by World War I,

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.409
peaked with the imprisonment of eight responsible brothers in 1918.

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:44.650
Combined with the wartime shortages of supplies,

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:48.569
it appeared impossible to continue operations in Brooklyn.

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:51.450
The Brooklyn Tabernacle was sold,

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.409
but efforts to sell 124 Columbia Heights failed.

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:59.409
Jehovah had plans for it.

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.969
The 1920s saw a renewed zeal for the ministry

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:09.810
and consequently a massive increase in the publication and distribution of books and magazines.

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.569
Rather than using commercial printers to produce our literature,

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.650
the decision was made to print it ourselves.

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.930
This required an expanded presence in Brooklyn.

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.449
After outgrowing a small printer-interested building,

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:25.169
then outgrowing another,

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:28.770
construction commenced on a new eight-story factory,

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:35.389
just a few blocks away from the expanded Brooklyn Bethel.

00:02:35.389 --> 00:02:39.430
Just over a decade later, during World War II,

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.030
Hitler had built his infamous concentration camps

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.909
and persecution of our brothers increased around the world.

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:51.830
Despite that, the number of kingdom publishers doubled during the war.

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.909
Jehovah knew this was no time to slow down.

00:02:56.949 --> 00:03:00.990
In 1940, construction began on a three-story building

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:04.469
at Kingdom Farm in South Lansing, New York.

00:03:04.469 --> 00:03:06.909
But what would it be used for?

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:09.270
Only Jehovah knew.

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:15.069
By 1943, the war had made building materials extremely scarce.

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:17.909
But the brothers had already finished construction.

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:22.469
Jehovah wanted it used as a school to train missionaries.

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:25.909
The Watch Tower Bible School of Gilead.

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:30.310
This marked the beginning of a period of astounding growth.

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.310
To keep pace with the ever-increasing demand for Bible literature,

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:39.789
in 1955, construction began on a second Brooklyn factory building.

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:45.270
Eventually, the printer complex covered five city blocks.

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:50.710
In a 22-year period, the number of kingdom publishers worldwide tripled.

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:55.870
In 1971, a printer was constructed at Watch Tower Farms in upstate New York,

00:03:55.909 --> 00:04:01.590
and has expanded several times over the years to increase its printing capacity.

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.189
By the mid-1980s, from Argentina to Zimbabwe,

00:04:06.189 --> 00:04:12.550
we expanded our facilities at more than 40 branches around the world.

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:16.829
As stated in the January 1st, 1986 Watch Tower,

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:21.069
there appears to be no end to the modern day expansion.

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:27.470
Jehovah's Organization is building for an eternal future.

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:34.110
Currently, in Africa, 13 branch facilities need to be enlarged or renovated.

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:39.230
Over 50 approved remote translation office projects are being developed.

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:42.230
And in order to keep up with publisher growth,

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:49.430
over five major kingdom hall projects need to be completed every single day.

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:53.670
We are producing more videos, all of which feed our hope.

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:57.029
That means we need more studio space.

00:04:57.029 --> 00:05:02.310
Since 2015, studios have been constructed in the United States,

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:06.870
Canada, Britain, South Africa, and most recently,

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:11.750
Australia, where the good news, according to Jesus, is being produced.

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:17.990
And coming soon, the new media center at Ramapo, New York.

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:24.790
We have overwhelming evidence that Jehovah directs his people's building work.

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:27.029
So we can be confident.

00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:35.189
The good hand of Jehovah will continue upon us as we build for an eternal future.
