00:00:01.139 --> 00:00:06.940
I hear the birds singing out to the sun rise

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:20.260
I see the stars fading away in the morning light

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:26.260
Golden sun shines on down through the tree tops

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:32.509
Where there is a summer breeze

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:35.909
That whispers so soft

00:00:35.909 --> 00:00:40.049
And I sing, oh, job

00:00:40.049 --> 00:00:42.450
You're over my guard

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.850
The work of your hands

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.850
Fills us with all

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.649
I stare at the stars

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:56.960
Wondering how you care who we are

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:06.590
I see your sing to you

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.790
I see your wonders

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.590
And I sing to you

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.790
I sing to you

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.189
I sing to you

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:25.810
Wondrous moving

00:01:25.810 --> 00:02:45.280
Retops of all we can see

00:02:45.280 --> 00:03:13.310
I stare at the stars

00:03:13.310 --> 00:04:06.469
I see your sing to you

00:04:06.469 --> 00:04:07.469
I sing
