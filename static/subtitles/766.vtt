00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:08.500
The greatest honor anyone can have is to be called a servant of the most

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:14.220
high God, Jehovah. And as you've seen from your deep study of God's word,

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:19.739
servants of Jehovah also have distinct personality traits and qualities

00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:25.940
that are called to mind when their names are mentioned. For example, what

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:34.259
qualities or traits do you think of when we mention the following names? Ruth,

00:00:34.259 --> 00:00:45.659
Gideon, David, Martha. Yes, the name of a servant of Jehovah can call to mind

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:53.840
certain qualities, certain traits that are worthy of imitation. So what will

00:00:53.840 --> 00:01:00.359
you be called? As you begin your new assignment, what quality or trait would

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:06.799
you like your fellow workers to think about when your name is mentioned? The Bible

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:12.640
book of Proverbs provides a very reachable goal in this regard. Please open to

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:19.959
Proverbs chapter 16 and we'll read together verse 21. That's Proverbs

00:01:19.959 --> 00:01:31.159
chapter 16 verse 21. The wise in heart will be called understanding. What a

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:36.840
worthy goal that is to be called a person of understanding. Now from your studies,

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.519
you know, understanding it's the ability to put the facts together, grasp the

00:01:41.519 --> 00:01:48.680
full complete picture of a matter. So how is understanding demonstrated? Is it

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:55.799
revealed in a test score or is it revealed by being the first to provide a

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:02.319
solution in a group setting or perhaps at a meeting? Well, let's keep reading

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:11.919
verse 21 and the one kind in speech adds persuasiveness. There's how

00:02:11.919 --> 00:02:18.400
understanding is demonstrated in kind speech or as the footnote indicates

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:26.759
appealing speech, sweetness of lips. So a person who's called understanding puts

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:33.280
the facts together, grasps the full picture in order to find good in a matter.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:41.439
And that is reflected through kind, positive, persuasive speech. Now this is

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:48.639
more than just being optimistic or the power of positive thinking. Understanding

00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:54.680
has a source. Please turn to Proverbs this time chapter 9 and we'll read

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:02.360
verse 10 as Proverbs chapter 9 verse 10. The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:11.199
wisdom and knowledge of the most holy one is understanding. There is the source

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:17.919
the most holy one, Jehovah God. He's both the source of understanding and

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:25.240
he's the supreme example in how to use it. I just think for a moment of what

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:30.680
happened after the tragic painful rebellion in the Garden of Eden. What did

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.599
Jehovah do? Immediately, he put the facts together, he saw the complete picture,

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:43.319
and then he uttered the Edenic promise, a positive promise that gives us hope even

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:49.680
right after that painful tragedy. And hundreds of years later with the nation of

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:57.439
Israel, they would repeatedly abandon Jehovah. What would he do? He would hear

00:03:57.439 --> 00:04:01.759
their groanings, he would hear their cries, he would see their changed attitude,

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:09.280
and he would raise up judges to save them time after time. Yes, Jehovah God

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:17.399
shows us what real understanding is. And because we trust in him, we too can find

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:24.279
the good, speak and act kindly and positively. And how refreshing it is to see

00:04:24.279 --> 00:04:30.560
this in your class, your kind positive speech and actions with one another and

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:35.759
with those that you come in contact with has been very refreshing to see. It's a

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:42.480
result of your deep trust in God's word and your deep trust in Jehovah himself. And

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:49.000
your studies have just further enhanced that over these past few months. In contrast,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.839
much of the world's education fosters critical thinking. And note what the

00:04:53.839 --> 00:04:59.480
watchtower says about this. We quote, do not be fooled by the mistaken notion that a

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:05.759
cynical, critical, pessimistic attitude is the same as intelligence. Actually,

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:14.300
negative thinking demands little of the intellect. So what a privilege to know as

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:19.740
you dear students do, what real understanding is, it's not just the ability to

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:25.100
identify what's wrong with a situation. It's the ability to identify how good can

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:31.620
address it. And this will encourage your brothers and sisters. One Bethel

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:37.300
family member observed understanding in the assistant overseer of a department. On

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.420
one occasion, the department overseer scheduled a meeting with several brothers

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:46.779
from other departments, but he forgot to inform his assistant. Then on the day of

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:54.500
the meeting, the overseer was away. So several brothers arrived for a meeting that

00:05:54.500 --> 00:06:00.980
the assistant knew nothing about. What would he do? It was observed. He said a

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:06.899
brief silent prayer came out. Welcome to group. Address the points for discussion.

00:06:06.899 --> 00:06:10.660
And at the end said, thank you, brothers, for coming to this meeting and allowing me

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:15.660
to fill in for the overseer. And I'll update him when he returns. He just covered

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:20.060
for him. Beautiful example. He knew this man had shouldered responsibility for

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:25.740
decades. This was not his pattern. So he just applied good. He showed understanding.

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:33.019
Now, realistically, there will be days when it will be hard to be known as a person

00:06:33.019 --> 00:06:38.420
of understanding. What if, though, there's a prolonged period of time where we're finding

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:47.139
it difficult to find the good, to speak and act kindly and positively. Maybe our mate

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:53.579
or a trusted friend even speaks with us and says, your kind, positive speech and actions

00:06:53.579 --> 00:07:02.220
are changing. What can we do? Well, each person and their relationship with Jehovah is unique.

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:09.060
But let's consider the example of the writer of Psalm 73 and learn a valuable principle.

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:14.779
The writer of this inspired Psalm was struggling with even whether or not to serve Jehovah. Note

00:07:14.779 --> 00:07:27.740
the turmoil he's in at Psalm 73 verse 14. And I was troubled all day long. Every morning

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:35.139
I was chastised. Now, it can be difficult to be known as a person of understanding when

00:07:35.139 --> 00:07:40.500
we're in this frame of mind. In fact, in verse 22, the Psalmist honestly admits I was

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:48.060
unreasoning and lacked understanding. So what would he do? Could he ever be called

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:58.500
understanding again? Notice verse 15. But if I had said these things, I would have betrayed

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:05.980
your people. So first, the Psalmist held back from making his perplexing thoughts public.

00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:10.939
He knew that that kind of negative speech would affect God's people. He likened it to

00:08:10.939 --> 00:08:16.779
a betrayal as if he were releasing the names of his fellow worshippers to the enemy. That's

00:08:16.779 --> 00:08:26.459
what he likened negative speech to. Instead, he kept to his spiritual routine and waited.

00:08:26.459 --> 00:08:37.669
And then a powerful moment took place in verse 26. My body and my heart may fail. But

00:08:37.669 --> 00:08:51.500
God is the rock of my heart and my portion forever. There it is. Understanding the Psalmist

00:08:51.500 --> 00:09:00.659
knew he was not alone. Jehovah God, the immovable rock was keeping him stable in the midst of

00:09:00.659 --> 00:09:07.620
this violent wind storm that he found himself in. That powerful realization plugged him back

00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:13.299
in to the source of understanding. And he was once again able to put the facts together,

00:09:13.299 --> 00:09:24.340
find good in a matter and speak and act kindly and positively. What's the lesson? When we are

00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:31.940
in turmoil and feel lacking in understanding, we are in good company. Many faithful servants of

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:38.740
Jehovah have felt this way. When we do, like the Psalmist, we hold back from negative speech,

00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:44.659
which can affect those around us. Instead, we speak privately with a trusted friend.

00:09:45.379 --> 00:09:54.980
We keep to our spiritual routine and we wait. We wait for our powerful moment. The realization

00:09:55.059 --> 00:10:06.580
that Jehovah God is the rock of our heart. And one final point, demonstrating understanding includes

00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:15.379
demonstrating it with ourself. You will make mistakes. And when you do, your trust in Jehovah will

00:10:15.379 --> 00:10:21.779
allow you to find the good in yourself. As Brother Sanderson mentioned in the opening comments.

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:26.340
And that will help you to keep a positive frame of mind.

00:10:27.539 --> 00:10:33.620
Well, we know Jehovah God is going to be with you in your assignments. May your trust in him,

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:39.860
the source of understanding continue to deepen. This will allow you to address situations by

00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:47.059
putting the facts together, finding good in a matter and speaking and acting kindly,

00:10:47.059 --> 00:10:53.620
positively, persuasively. When you do this, you'll be showing that you are wise in heart and

00:10:53.620 --> 00:11:02.980
you will be called understanding.
