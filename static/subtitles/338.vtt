00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:05.259
Well, let's look at Jude 9 in context.

00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:08.500
Open to the book of Jude.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:14.490
We'll reverse one first of all.

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:15.890
It says,

00:00:37.189 --> 00:00:41.189
But why do we say that it was a humble introduction?

00:00:41.189 --> 00:00:43.189
Well, you notice he said,

00:00:43.189 --> 00:00:47.189
slave of Jesus and brother of James.

00:00:47.189 --> 00:00:49.189
Well, who was James?

00:00:49.189 --> 00:00:51.189
Well, he was a half-brother of Jesus.

00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:55.189
So that means that Jude also was a half-brother of Jesus,

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:57.189
but he never alluded to that as introduction.

00:00:57.189 --> 00:01:01.189
He simply said, a slave of Christ.

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:05.189
Now, the Bible doesn't say, but very likely,

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.189
both James and Jude felt a measure of regret

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:12.189
that they had not become a disciple of Jesus

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:14.189
while he was on earth.

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.189
So much so to the point that Jesus, when he was dying,

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.189
he left their mother's care in their cousin,

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.189
John's hands, rather than to either one of them.

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:27.189
But once they came to their senses spiritually,

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:30.189
they were wholly devoted for the teachings of Jesus

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:32.189
and his father.

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.189
And Jude, the book of Jude as an example,

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:36.189
a short letter but powerful.

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:39.189
Now, if you look at verse three,

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:44.189
Jude had intended to write about the salvation

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.189
that all Christians hold in common.

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:50.189
But because of circumstances in the congregation at the time,

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.189
he changed his mind, or did you hope he changed it for him?

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:58.189
And so now, the book of Jude becomes a local needs part.

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:01.189
And what was the need in the congregations at time?

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:03.189
Well, glance down through some of the verses.

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:05.189
In verse four,

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.189
certain men have slipped into the congregation.

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:11.189
He says they ungodly with brazen conduct.

00:02:11.189 --> 00:02:14.189
At 12 and 13, rocks below the water, waterless clouds,

00:02:14.189 --> 00:02:17.189
fruitless trees having died twice,

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:22.189
waves casting up the foam of shame, stars with no set course.

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:23.189
Look at 16.

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:27.189
These men are murmurs, complainers following their own desires,

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:31.189
making grandiose boasts while they're flattering others

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:33.189
for their own benefit.

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:35.189
Excuse me.

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:39.189
So he's really describing the traits of apostates today, isn't he?

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:42.189
But what is verse nine all about?

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:44.189
Can we read it again in this entirety?

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:46.189
It says, when Michael, the archangel,

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:47.189
had a difference with the devil,

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:49.189
and was disputing about Moses' body,

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:53.189
he did not dare to bring judgment against him in abusive terms,

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:56.189
but said, made Jehovah rebuke you.

00:02:56.189 --> 00:02:59.189
Well, Michael's name,

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:01.189
it's the name of Jesus when he was heaven,

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:04.189
both before and after, his sojourn to the earth.

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:09.189
Well, when did this dispute with the devil over Moses' body occur?

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:12.189
Well, it certainly wasn't when Jude was writing this in 65.

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:15.189
He's just using this as an example from the past

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:20.189
of one who did not assume authority that did not belong to him.

00:03:20.189 --> 00:03:23.189
I'll find you to run me 34-6 with me.

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:30.979
Now, it's evidently the devil wanted Moses' body

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:35.979
to ensnare the Israelites into some kind of relic worship.

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:37.979
And so he wanted Moses' body.

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:42.979
Verse six of Deuteronomy 34, it says of Moses being buried.

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:45.979
It says he buried him in the valley in the land of Moab,

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:47.979
opposite Bethpure,

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:51.979
and nobody knows where his grave is down to this day.

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:57.979
February 15th, 2015, watchtower explained that Michael had no qualms

00:03:57.979 --> 00:04:01.979
about arguing this case legally with Satan,

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:03.979
because really that's what it was.

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:06.979
It was a matter of Satan didn't have the right to Moses' body.

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:11.979
So like a skillful trial lawyer, Michael disputed,

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:15.979
it says with him in the Bible, disputed or we could say argued the case.

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:19.980
But then it came time for a decision about what to do with Satan.

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.980
He left that for the supreme judge.

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:24.980
So Jude was given a lesson to those in the congregations

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:27.980
that he said were despising authority.

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:29.980
Speaking abusively of glorious ones,

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:31.980
it was a lesson for them.

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:35.980
Michael said a good example of not overstepping authority.

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:39.980
And that becomes an equally good lesson for us today

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:43.980
to know the limits of our authority and responsibility.

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:46.980
And unlike those rebellious ones in Jude's day,

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:51.980
we don't want to be rebellious.

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:54.980
Instead, we want to follow the lead of the faithful slave,

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:56.980
be content to do that.

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:02.980
The slave that Michael, our Lord Christ Jesus is using today.

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:04.980
Well, in deferring to Jehovah's decision,

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:08.980
was Jesus in any way showing weakness?

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:10.980
No, it was just respect for authority.

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:11.980
How do we know?

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:14.980
Well, after the birth of the Messianic Kingdom,

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:18.980
there was no waiting for Jehovah in that case

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:22.980
to bring Satan to terms, rebuke him.

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:26.980
Because Jehovah had authorized Jesus, Michael,

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:29.980
had authorized him to war with the devil and his demons

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:34.980
to throw him out of the heavens and Jesus did so with gusto.

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:36.980
Well, here's a question.

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:39.980
Are apostates today as reprehensible

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:42.980
as those ones that Jude mentioned in his short letter?

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:45.980
Are they devious?

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:50.980
Or maybe they're sincerely trying to help poor, misguided witnesses?

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:53.980
No. They're devious.

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:57.980
Have you noticed that apostates generally

00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:59.980
do not try to reason from the scriptures?

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:01.980
Why not?

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:03.980
Because they know we know the scriptures

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:05.980
and we would see through the twisting.

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:07.980
Instead, they pick at the organization.

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:09.980
They twist truth.

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:14.980
They use lies, half-truths to try to grab a mind.

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:17.980
Well, are they deceitful?

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:18.980
Absolutely.

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:19.980
Here's an example.

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:22.980
I worked in writing correspondence many years ago,

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:26.980
and they get letters from everyone that has our address.

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:29.980
And sometimes those letters are from ones

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:32.980
who have been fed apostate information.

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:35.980
And one example I came through in my stack of letters,

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:38.980
it was a sincere older lady, it seemed,

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:40.980
by the look of the scroll of her handwriting.

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:42.980
It was probably an older woman.

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:45.980
And she sent in a photocopy from a page

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:48.980
of a 1910 watchtower.

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:50.980
And her question,

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:52.980
is why did your Mr. Russell say

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:55.980
that you only need to read his book studies in the scriptures

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:58.980
instead of the Bible?

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:00.980
Well, I read over the photocopy,

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:03.980
and it looks like that's exactly what it said.

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:06.980
But then I got original the 1910 magazine and compared,

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:09.980
and very quickly you could discern the deceit,

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:12.980
the trickery that was involved.

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:14.980
When photocopying that page,

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:17.980
they put a piece of white paper over the bottom part of the page

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:21.980
so that you didn't see the bottom of the first column.

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:23.980
And they were very tricky.

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:26.980
They placed it exactly on a line

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:29.980
where it sounded like when reading down the first column

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:32.980
that the sentence completed on the second column.

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:35.980
But what was in the first part of that column

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:38.980
that they had made invisible with the paper?

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:40.980
It was a subheading.

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:44.980
Scripture studies not a substitute for the Bible.

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:46.980
And here's what it said in that text

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:49.980
that was disappeared with their photocopying.

00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:52.980
It says this is not therefore putting Scripture studies

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:54.980
as a substitute for the Bible.

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:56.980
Because so far a substituting for the Bible,

00:07:56.980 --> 00:08:00.980
the studies on the contrary continually refer to the Bible.

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:03.980
And everyone has any doubt as to a reference

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:07.980
or if one's recollection should lapse in any degree,

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:09.980
one should refresh his memory

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:11.980
and in fact should see that his every thought

00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:14.980
is in harmony with the Bible,

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:16.980
not merely in accord with Scripture studies,

00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:19.980
but in accord with the Bible.

00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:22.980
Now why would someone do that?

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:24.980
They doctored the page

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:26.980
because of deceit and trickery.

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:29.980
There was no sincere effort to help that dear old lady

00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:31.980
who received a copy.

00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:36.980
Well the book of Jude is applicable for our view of those today

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:41.980
who are like evil rocks hidden below the water.

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:43.980
Well let's end our discussion with a flourish

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:48.980
of positive reinforcement from the pin of Jude.

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:54.980
In Jude verses 24 and 25.

00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:59.980
It says now to the one who is able to guard you from stumbling

00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:02.980
and to make you stand unblemished in the sight of his glory

00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:03.980
with great joy,

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:06.980
to the only God our Savior

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:08.980
through Jesus Christ our Lord,

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:12.980
the glory, majesty, might, and authority

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:14.980
for all past eternity

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:19.980
and now and into all eternity, amen.
