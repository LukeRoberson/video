00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:09.810
If you were asked to think of two men in the first century who were zealous disciple-makers who would come to your mind,

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:12.810
you may be thinking of Paul and Barnabas.

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:20.809
Together, they traveled extensively preaching the good news and helping many to learn the wonderful truth about Jehovah.

00:00:20.809 --> 00:00:25.809
This work brought joy not only to them, but others too.

00:00:26.809 --> 00:00:32.810
Acts 15-3 states, so after being escorted partway by the congregation,

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:41.810
these men continued on through both Phoenicia and Samaria relating in detail the conversion of people of the nations

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:45.810
and bringing great joy to all the brothers.

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:50.810
Their shared experiences were a great source of joy to the brotherhood.

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:56.810
They all felt encouraged and united as one spiritual family.

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:05.810
So too today, we have many like Paul and Barnabas who are actively working to find honest-hearted ones.

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:14.810
Let's quickly review the numbers and see what our spiritual families United efforts have accomplished during the 2019 service year.

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.810
The good news was preached in 240 lands.

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:25.810
The average number of publishers each month reached over 8.4 million.

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.810
More than 2 billion hours were spent in the field.

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:39.810
Also, you'll be pleased to know that the number baptized surpassed 300,000 for the first time in 20 years.

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:49.810
That's on average 5,843 people symbolizing their dedication to Jehovah every weekend.

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.810
And there's great potential for millions more to embrace the truth.

00:01:53.810 --> 00:02:03.810
On average, 9.6 million Bible studies were conducted each month and almost 21 million attended the memorial.

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:11.810
We praise Jehovah for this growth and thank you for your share in this great increase.

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:17.810
The governing body receives some beautiful experiences and reports this past service year.

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.810
And they wanted to share that joy with all of you now.

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:28.810
Would you like to hear some of these reports and meet some of our hard-working brothers and sisters?

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.810
Well then, let's go.

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:40.810
We'll meet publishers from 6 regions of the earth and hearing their own words, the effect that the disciple making work has on them.

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.379
Here's a quick peek.

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:47.379
We'll see some of their unique challenges.

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:51.379
When it rains, they are so much mud everywhere.

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:55.379
We need to remove our shoes and hold them in our hands.

00:02:56.379 --> 00:03:00.379
We'll meet ones who made personal sacrifices.

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:07.379
When I turned 60 and retired, my wife and I decided to serve where the need is greater.

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:10.379
This brother can see but he cannot walk.

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:15.659
And me, I can walk but cannot see.

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:19.659
We'll see the impact the truth can have on new ones.

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:24.659
It may be happy yet can I really dare believe that?

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:31.659
I was actually sort of in shock and really put a spotlight on who I really was.

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:34.659
What bad habits did some have at first?

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:40.439
What pressures did they face?

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:45.259
And how did they overcome that?

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:51.259
One day she asked her to choose between family and Jehovah.

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:55.259
Hopefully that wets your appetite for what's to come.

00:03:55.259 --> 00:04:02.259
Now, as we take you around the world, enjoy the stories of your brothers and sisters

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:07.259
and watch for clues to what contributed to their joy.

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:12.120
Let's begin with Africa.

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:21.120
Its stretches from the Mediterranean past the Golden Sahara through mountains and savannas to the Cape of Good Hope.

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:27.120
This continent is known for the enormous diversity and richness of its wildlife.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:37.500
Africa's population, about 1.3 billion people, is growing faster than any other part of the world.

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:44.100
More than 1,500 languages are spoken here.

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:49.100
The first Christian from Africa, the Ethiopian Unic, mentioned at Acts chapter 8,

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:56.100
likely brought the good news back with him to Ethiopia when he returned home.

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:04.100
Today, over 1.7 million publishers are making disciples throughout this vast continent.

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:11.100
Let's visit our brothers and sisters in Africa's most populous country, Nigeria.

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:19.100
More than 360,000 publishers are sharing the good news with Nigeria's over 200 million people.

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:28.100
The territory is highly diverse, more than 500 languages and 250 ethnic groups.

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:32.100
It's so encouraging to see the response to the good news.

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:43.100
Some 870,000 Bible studies are being conducted and on average 273 are baptized each week.

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:48.100
This is the Utankong congregation in Benwe State.

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:57.100
Here, 51 publishers and 4 regular pioneers are having good results despite a challenging territory.

00:05:59.439 --> 00:06:02.439
Preaching in the Utankong territory is enjoyable.

00:06:02.439 --> 00:06:06.439
It is just that it is accompanied by some problems.

00:06:06.439 --> 00:06:13.439
One is that the territories are very far apart and two, the roads are not good.

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:17.439
It takes us three hours to get to some territories.

00:06:17.439 --> 00:06:20.439
When it rains, there is so much mud everywhere.

00:06:20.439 --> 00:06:25.439
We need to remove our shoes and hold them in our hands.

00:06:25.439 --> 00:06:31.439
Whether households are churchgoers, Muslims or traditional healers, they listen.

00:06:31.439 --> 00:06:37.439
Many even accept our invitation to attend the meetings despite the travel challenges.

00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:46.439
So it makes us very happy to see that in spite of far territories, bedrooms, we see good results.

00:06:46.439 --> 00:06:54.490
I'm enjoying my life now, but when I lost my sight, I thought it was all over.

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:59.490
As a carpenter, I wondered how I would be able to do my carpentry.

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:02.490
The thought of it worried me so much.

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:08.490
But as I began to learn about Jehovah from the Bible, I came to realize that there was hope.

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:13.490
That negative thinking that my life was over disappeared from my mind.

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:17.490
So I am very happy now. I am joyful.

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:19.490
There is a brother named Joseph.

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:22.490
This brother can see, but he cannot walk.

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:25.490
And me, I can walk, but cannot see.

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:29.490
Our hold is wheelchair and push while he directs it.

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:33.490
This has helped us to meet many of our Bible students.

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:37.490
Before now, we were few that went out in the field as pioneers.

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:40.490
But now, we are many.

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:43.490
This shows that the example has helped other people.

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:49.490
Because when they see someone who cannot walk and someone who cannot see a pioneering,

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:54.279
they conclude that they can pioneer too.

00:07:54.279 --> 00:07:58.279
This is the experience of one of my relatives.

00:07:58.279 --> 00:08:03.279
His name is Cletus. He was very kind to me.

00:08:03.279 --> 00:08:07.279
He would hold my hand and assist me to the meetings of the Kingdom Hall.

00:08:07.279 --> 00:08:10.279
When he got to the Kingdom Hall, he would leave for his church.

00:08:10.279 --> 00:08:15.279
But as he noticed how I preached and attended meetings,

00:08:15.279 --> 00:08:19.279
the joy I radiated, the way we treated other people

00:08:19.279 --> 00:08:22.279
and our knowledge of the scriptures.

00:08:22.279 --> 00:08:28.279
He was impressed and began asking many questions.

00:08:28.279 --> 00:08:32.279
The answers he got were quite different from what he had learnt.

00:08:32.279 --> 00:08:34.279
What they told him in church.

00:08:34.279 --> 00:08:39.330
They continued telling him, get out of there

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:41.330
and that he should not talk to me again.

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:50.870
He studied the Bible, concluded his study and got baptized.

00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:53.870
Now he serves as a ministerial servant.

00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:58.870
Sometimes they used to assign talks to both of us to handle as a symposium.

00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:04.870
And this made me see Cletus as a spiritual brother in the organization and the congregation.

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:11.980
This gives me joy and makes me very happy.

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:14.980
When people notice our activities,

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:18.980
they usually praise Jehovah and encourage us to do more.

00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:22.980
Since they know that the work we do is not by our power,

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:26.980
but it is Jehovah who empowers us.

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:31.980
It is true that I am blind, but I can see Jehovah.

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:36.980
I am helping other people see Jehovah's hand in our lives.

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:40.980
Even people are disabled, can bring praise to Jehovah.

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:49.000
I have nothing to do other than to be joyful and praise Jehovah for my life.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:54.700
We share your joy brother Igbo.

00:09:54.700 --> 00:10:01.700
Doesn't it touch our hearts to see Gabriel and Joseph helping each other in the pioneer work?

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:07.700
Their example encourages others to ask what prevents me from pioneering.

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:11.700
Perhaps we are moved to ask that question too.

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:14.700
And did you notice what spurred Cletus to action?

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:19.700
He observed the conduct of Gabriel and other witnesses in the congregation.

00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:21.700
What do we learn?

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:28.700
That our Christian conduct often speaks louder than even the most eloquent words.

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:34.700
Now we go to the largest continent in the world, Asia.

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:38.700
Asia is home to three fifths of the world's people,

00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:43.700
including some 760,000 Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:50.700
The geography of Asia ranges from Tundra to coral reefs.

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:59.700
From Earth's tallest peak Mount Everest to its lowest land surface, the Dead Sea.

00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:03.700
Asia's cultural diversity is greater than any other continent.

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:10.700
The two most populated countries in the world, China and India, are here in Asia.

00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:13.700
Let's visit our brothers in India.

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:26.519
With a growing population of about 1.3 billion people, India is on track to become the world's most popular country within a decade.

00:11:26.519 --> 00:11:30.519
Imagine the potential for growth in India.

00:11:30.519 --> 00:11:35.519
With 90% of the population having not yet received a witness,

00:11:35.519 --> 00:11:40.519
our 50,000 brothers and sisters have plenty of work to do.

00:11:40.519 --> 00:11:45.519
The good news is being preached in territory that includes mountain ranges,

00:11:45.519 --> 00:11:50.519
plains and plateaues, villages and some of the world's largest cities.

00:11:50.519 --> 00:11:55.830
Hyderabad is in South Central India.

00:11:55.830 --> 00:12:02.830
This is the Hyderabad RTC Crossroad Congregation in the heart of the city.

00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:11.830
Here, 94 publishers, including 17 regular pioneers, are conducting 95 Bible studies.

00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:17.830
They were delighted to have 252 at 10 last year's memorial.

00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:20.830
Let's meet Sungla.

00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:32.620
His story actually begins in another part of India, where he learned the truth with the help of Alex and Anidhas.

00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:37.620
My wife and I serve in the Pandabhar Sign Language Group.

00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:45.620
Currently, there are only three publishers, me, my wife and another brother who is deaf.

00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:50.620
We have contact with our own 100 deaf ones in our territory.

00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:56.149
Each week, 50 to 60 deaf ones attend the meetings.

00:12:56.149 --> 00:13:00.149
When they come, they bring their deaf friends with them.

00:13:00.149 --> 00:13:03.149
They also bring their relatives.

00:13:03.149 --> 00:13:10.149
We are so happy to see them come regularly for the meetings in spite of the opposition from their families,

00:13:10.149 --> 00:13:13.149
sometimes even severe opposition.

00:13:13.149 --> 00:13:18.169
They are progressing well spiritually.

00:13:18.169 --> 00:13:24.799
We are really happy to see their spiritual advancement.

00:13:24.799 --> 00:13:31.799
When I turned 60 and retired, my wife and I decided to serve where the need is greater.

00:13:31.799 --> 00:13:36.799
To our surprise, we were asked to support the sign language field.

00:13:36.799 --> 00:13:41.799
At that time, we did not have any experience in sign language.

00:13:41.799 --> 00:13:46.799
Then our circuit overseer asked us if we were ready to move to where the need is greater.

00:13:46.799 --> 00:13:54.799
He asked if we would move to Lachurra, a city that was 521 miles from our home.

00:13:54.799 --> 00:14:00.799
Once we reached a city, we were overjoyed to see the interest of the deaf ones.

00:14:00.799 --> 00:14:03.799
So, we decided to stay there.

00:14:03.799 --> 00:14:11.210
Not long after we arrived there, we met a priest, whose name is Sangram.

00:14:11.210 --> 00:14:17.210
He was the leader of a deaf association, and he was short-tempered.

00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:26.100
Since we wanted to meet him often, we invited him to our home to discuss the daily text.

00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:31.100
He came regularly at 7 o'clock for daily text discussions.

00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:35.100
When we moved here, we did not know how to sign very well.

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:38.100
Both my wife and I knew almost nothing.

00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:43.100
But after we met Sangram and started to teach him the Bible,

00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:46.100
we in turn started to learn sign language from him.

00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:51.100
We were very happy. We were really, very happy.

00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:55.100
As soon as we started studying the Bible with Sangram,

00:14:55.100 --> 00:15:00.100
he made changes in his life in line with the Bible principles.

00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:07.100
He changed his hairstyle. He left the deaf association in which he was the leader.

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:10.100
And even his personality changed.

00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:14.100
He stopped responding angrily to those who provoked him.

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:18.100
We are so happy about the Bible discussions we had with him,

00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:22.100
because with this, his life changed completely.

00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:26.100
Soon, he broke almost all of his bad habits.

00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:31.100
However, he was still unable to stop his habit of chewing tobacco.

00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:37.100
Now, since we loved him, we took him to a dentist and had his teeth cleaned.

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:44.100
After that visit to the dentist, he completely stopped using tobacco.

00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:48.100
Within six months from starting the Bible study,

00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:51.100
Sangram became a qualified publisher.

00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:56.889
And after that, he continued to progress well.

00:15:56.889 --> 00:16:00.889
The publisher now has a sign language congregation.

00:16:00.889 --> 00:16:03.889
My wife and I then moved to another group.

00:16:03.889 --> 00:16:06.889
We are now serving in Pandepur.

00:16:06.889 --> 00:16:11.889
When we meet our old studies in the conventions and see their progress,

00:16:11.889 --> 00:16:14.889
we are overjoyed.

00:16:14.889 --> 00:16:19.889
The very thought that Jehovah's extended us this privilege to serve him

00:16:19.889 --> 00:16:22.889
makes us overwhelmed with happiness.

00:16:22.889 --> 00:16:32.100
There are no words to express how we feel.

00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:35.100
When Sangram showed us his big smile,

00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:38.100
did a smile come to your face too?

00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:41.100
That's how the truth affects us.

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:45.100
And don't we appreciate the sacrifices that Alex and Annie made

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:48.100
in order to serve where the need was greater?

00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:53.100
They had to learn sign language and move far away from their home.

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:55.100
But how did it turn out?

00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:59.100
Alex says, they are overwhelmed with happiness.

00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:01.100
Imagine that.

00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:06.920
They were certainly rewarded for their sacrificing spirit.

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:09.920
We now move west to Europe.

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:13.920
Europe gave birth to the Greek and Roman empires,

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:16.920
the Middle Ages and the Renaissance.

00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:20.920
With 160 culturally distinct groups,

00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:25.920
Europe is immensely varied and densely populated.

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:29.920
Almost 1.6 million Jehovah's Witnesses

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:32.920
are taking disciples on this continent.

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:37.920
In southeastern Europe, you'll find Romania,

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:41.920
a country of nearly 20 million people.

00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:49.920
Today, over 39,000 publishers are conducting almost 22,000 Bible studies.

00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:54.920
8 out of 10 people belong to the Romanian Orthodox Church.

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:58.920
The ratio of publishers to the population varies greatly.

00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:06.920
From 1 to 4,000 in the southeast to 1 to 7 in Transylvania in the northwest.

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:12.329
Last year, special preaching campaigns were organized

00:18:12.329 --> 00:18:15.329
to reach those in unassigned territories.

00:18:15.329 --> 00:18:21.329
As a result, 85% of these territories have been given a witness.

00:18:21.329 --> 00:18:28.119
Here are the 112 publishers and four regular pioneers

00:18:28.119 --> 00:18:32.119
of the Gibo Centro Congregation.

00:18:32.119 --> 00:18:36.119
They serve a territory that includes a small city,

00:18:36.119 --> 00:18:41.119
rural areas, and large communities of Hungarians and Roma.

00:18:41.119 --> 00:18:46.119
Let's see what it's like to make disciples there.

00:18:46.119 --> 00:18:49.119
One of the challenges we face in our town

00:18:49.119 --> 00:18:54.119
is that we have a small territory compared to the number of brothers.

00:18:54.119 --> 00:18:58.119
The ratio of one publisher to about 40 inhabitants.

00:18:58.119 --> 00:19:03.119
So we put great emphasis on preaching in the villages around Gibo.

00:19:03.119 --> 00:19:07.119
Jehovah blessed our effort and we have more Bible studies,

00:19:07.119 --> 00:19:11.589
which make good progress.

00:19:11.589 --> 00:19:14.589
When I was still in elementary school,

00:19:14.589 --> 00:19:16.589
not yet baptized myself,

00:19:16.589 --> 00:19:20.589
I used to speak about Jehovah to one of my classmates.

00:19:20.589 --> 00:19:22.589
Her name was Oana.

00:19:22.589 --> 00:19:26.589
She was very interested and even asked many questions.

00:19:26.589 --> 00:19:28.589
We were both 12 at that time.

00:19:28.589 --> 00:19:31.589
A little while later, after I got baptized,

00:19:31.589 --> 00:19:34.589
Oana became my first Bible student.

00:19:34.589 --> 00:19:43.299
I was able to show her how to prepare well for the study.

00:19:43.299 --> 00:19:46.299
In the evening, we used to read the Bible together

00:19:46.299 --> 00:19:51.299
and we even wrote down in a notebook our favourite Bible texts.

00:19:51.299 --> 00:19:55.299
At the same time, by means of different study projects,

00:19:55.299 --> 00:19:58.299
I tried to help her see Jehovah as a real person.

00:19:58.299 --> 00:20:02.299
For example, we wrote down on a big sheet of paper,

00:20:02.299 --> 00:20:06.299
all of Jehovah's qualities and the way we could imitate them.

00:20:06.299 --> 00:20:11.279
Oana made good progress, attended the meetings,

00:20:11.279 --> 00:20:14.279
and even started to participate.

00:20:14.279 --> 00:20:21.069
I was so happy to see how much joy Oana had in learning about the truth.

00:20:21.069 --> 00:20:26.930
Not surprisingly, difficulties arose on the way.

00:20:27.930 --> 00:20:31.930
Oana's mother was not happy at all that I was studying with her daughter.

00:20:31.930 --> 00:20:38.839
She forbade her to study and one day she asked her

00:20:38.839 --> 00:20:41.839
to choose between family and Jehovah

00:20:41.839 --> 00:20:44.839
and put her out of the house.

00:20:44.839 --> 00:20:49.559
Oana was 16 years old.

00:20:49.559 --> 00:20:55.559
I encouraged Oana with the scripture from Isaiah 41, verses 10 and 13,

00:20:55.559 --> 00:20:58.559
which says that Jehovah is grasping our hand

00:20:58.559 --> 00:21:01.559
and that he will help us.

00:21:02.559 --> 00:21:05.559
We talked a lot together and we prayed together.

00:21:05.559 --> 00:21:09.559
And after only one week Jehovah answered our prayers,

00:21:09.559 --> 00:21:14.559
Oana's mother calmed down and not only allowed her to return home

00:21:14.559 --> 00:21:18.559
but also to attend meetings and to continue studying together.

00:21:18.559 --> 00:21:21.559
I was so happy.

00:21:21.559 --> 00:21:28.059
On 21st July 2018, Oana got baptized.

00:21:28.059 --> 00:21:34.059
Now I can finally preach together with my spiritual sister.

00:21:34.059 --> 00:21:37.059
Jehovah always gave me the joy I needed.

00:21:37.059 --> 00:21:48.119
In fact, I can't find the words to describe the joy I experience now.

00:21:48.119 --> 00:21:53.119
Did you notice where and when Beatrice started talking to Oana about Jehovah?

00:21:53.119 --> 00:22:00.119
In elementary school, what a wonderful reminder that you young ones can experience joy

00:22:00.119 --> 00:22:04.119
by making school your personal territory.

00:22:04.119 --> 00:22:09.119
If you haven't tried it already, look for someone with whom you can share the good news.

00:22:09.119 --> 00:22:13.119
You may be surprised at the results.

00:22:13.119 --> 00:22:17.119
Let's go next to North America.

00:22:17.119 --> 00:22:21.119
Now this continent extends from tiny islands near the Arctic

00:22:21.119 --> 00:22:25.119
to the isthmus of Panama in the south.

00:22:25.119 --> 00:22:31.119
North America is home to almost 2.6 million Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:22:31.119 --> 00:22:36.119
The United States is by far the most populous country in North America

00:22:36.119 --> 00:22:40.119
with over 325 million people.

00:22:40.119 --> 00:22:48.460
Here you can find metropolitan cities as well as vast areas that are sparsely populated.

00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:53.460
This territory is cared for by more than 1.2 million publishers

00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:58.460
and over 180,000 pioneers.

00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:03.460
Meet the brothers and sisters of the Juniata River, Pennsylvania German congregation

00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:07.460
in Mifflin Town, Pennsylvania.

00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:09.460
As we'll see in the following report,

00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:27.119
their unique territory is rich with people who sincerely respect God's Word.

00:23:27.119 --> 00:23:30.119
The challenges are territory being so vast.

00:23:30.119 --> 00:23:36.119
Sometimes you may drive an hour and a half, two hours just to get to the territory.

00:23:36.119 --> 00:23:41.119
One of my favorite joys is getting to use the Bible constantly in this field.

00:23:41.119 --> 00:23:45.119
They respect the Bible. They all have one in their house.

00:23:45.119 --> 00:23:50.119
Starting this language almost three years ago from a pregroup to now a congregation

00:23:50.119 --> 00:23:55.119
with four groups in the area, you can see the growth and the excitement of everyone.

00:23:55.119 --> 00:24:02.529
Honestly, I can say it's been the happiest time of my life since I started working in this field.

00:24:02.529 --> 00:24:16.299
Out in service one day, just working door to door, I met a lady and she accepted the greatest man book.

00:24:16.299 --> 00:24:21.299
Eventually, Memorial season came around. I went and left an invitation with Jane.

00:24:21.299 --> 00:24:26.299
We went back the day before the Memorial and were surprised when Jane said,

00:24:26.299 --> 00:24:28.299
yes, we'd love to come.

00:24:29.299 --> 00:24:37.670
So we talked about a Bible study and eventually Jerry agreed to having one as a family.

00:24:37.670 --> 00:24:40.670
But there was a contrast from what I've been taught.

00:24:40.670 --> 00:24:48.670
So I was willing to dig for more knowledge to try and figure out what was going on here.

00:24:48.670 --> 00:24:53.670
He read scripture Psalms about the earth and I said,

00:24:53.670 --> 00:25:02.500
wow, yes, all the things I patron myself doing in heaven is the things I enjoy on earth.

00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:07.500
And maybe happy yet, can I really dare believe that?

00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:16.500
The more I studied about the Bible, looked up the scriptures, the more I realized I never really knew a whole lot about the Bible.

00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:24.450
I was actually sort of in shock and really put a spotlight on who I really was.

00:25:24.450 --> 00:25:27.450
At one point, Ben and I went over to make a return visit.

00:25:27.450 --> 00:25:35.450
We had planned what we wanted to do with the family and it just did not lend to that at all.

00:25:35.450 --> 00:25:40.450
And we ended up playing cards. Instead, we didn't get to share anything from the Bible.

00:25:40.450 --> 00:25:45.450
The family was like, oh, it dawned on them. We're real people too.

00:25:45.450 --> 00:25:53.759
In the Pennsylvania German culture, people teach pretty strongly obedience to parents to make God happy.

00:25:54.759 --> 00:25:57.759
One day, Jerry lets me know that his dad wants to talk to me.

00:25:57.759 --> 00:26:02.759
Although my dad meant it well, he tried to stop the study.

00:26:02.759 --> 00:26:08.759
But the information that he was bringing to me about the witnesses is not what I saw.

00:26:08.759 --> 00:26:14.759
What we were being taught was directly from my Bible I had in my house.

00:26:14.759 --> 00:26:17.759
How could it be wrong?

00:26:17.759 --> 00:26:21.759
You could tell they were just distraught as a family to what was going on.

00:26:21.759 --> 00:26:28.380
They wanted to do the right thing, but they could feel all the pressure to stop.

00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:36.559
We eventually had to cut ties in order to continue spiritual growth.

00:26:36.559 --> 00:26:39.559
After that, Jerry and Jane just progressed very fast.

00:26:39.559 --> 00:26:45.559
They were making changes in their life and they got to really see the freedom that serving Jehovah gives you.

00:26:45.559 --> 00:26:56.529
Seeing their joy grow was irreplaceable. It was fantastic.

00:26:56.529 --> 00:27:00.529
We have gained a hundredfold what we could have ever lost.

00:27:00.529 --> 00:27:10.289
And so as we share good news with individuals and as they make progress, we are very excited and happy.

00:27:10.289 --> 00:27:18.079
I would love just everyone to have that opportunity to have that same joy.

00:27:18.079 --> 00:27:24.079
What happened when Jerry and Jane read for themselves the truths contained in the Bible?

00:27:24.079 --> 00:27:31.079
It deeply affected their thoughts and emotions and revealed who they really were on the inside.

00:27:31.079 --> 00:27:37.079
As a result, they now joyfully served Jehovah along with their children.

00:27:37.079 --> 00:27:41.079
Ben and Joanna used the Bible skillfully.

00:27:41.079 --> 00:27:44.079
They let God's words speak for itself.

00:27:44.079 --> 00:27:52.079
And the joy this experience brought them is as Ben said, irreplaceable, fantastic.

00:27:52.079 --> 00:27:59.079
That kind of joy is contagious. We feel it too just watching them.

00:27:59.079 --> 00:28:02.079
Next we go to Oceania.

00:28:02.079 --> 00:28:13.079
This is the collective name for Australia and for the more than 10,000 islands in the Pacific Ocean between Asia and the Americas.

00:28:13.079 --> 00:28:21.079
Some of Oceania's islands are known as high islands because they were developed as volcanic eruptions

00:28:21.079 --> 00:28:25.079
built up land over time.

00:28:25.079 --> 00:28:33.079
Low islands such as the country of Kiribas are made of coral and sometimes barely reach above sea level.

00:28:33.079 --> 00:28:40.079
Over 100,000 Jehovah's Witnesses are hard at work in this beautiful territory.

00:28:40.079 --> 00:28:51.579
Fiji is an archipelago of some 300 islands scattered over 3 million square kilometers or about 1 million square miles.

00:28:52.579 --> 00:29:00.579
This territory is cared for by some 3,000 publishers and over 500 pioneers.

00:29:00.579 --> 00:29:07.579
In the last service here, they conducted over 4,700 Bible studies.

00:29:07.579 --> 00:29:13.579
These brothers and sisters are in the South Suva English congregation.

00:29:13.579 --> 00:29:17.579
Let's see what unique challenges our brothers face there.

00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:25.500
Many, if not all, in our territory know about God's Word, the Bible.

00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:28.500
However, they are taught false teachings.

00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:34.500
The challenge arises when customs and traditions conflict with Bible teachings.

00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:43.500
As they study and they progress, they face opposition from their family and of course there's the social pressure that comes from their community.

00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:47.500
Added to this is the materialistic goals that are put before them.

00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:52.500
So all of this combined really poses a challenge with these ones progressing.

00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:57.500
Despite these challenges, some of them eventually do study the Bible with us.

00:29:57.500 --> 00:30:02.500
Some have become Jehovah's friends and made the truth their own.

00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:14.390
So to be able to show these ones from God's Word, the Bible, that Jehovah is a God of love and to see their reaction that in itself is a wonderful blessing.

00:30:14.390 --> 00:30:19.390
I used to study with this young girl. She wanted to make progress in the truth.

00:30:19.390 --> 00:30:25.390
But in order for her to do that, she had to overcome these two biggest obstacles.

00:30:25.390 --> 00:30:34.390
One was this career that she had and the other was the obstacle from her unbelieving family.

00:30:34.390 --> 00:30:37.390
I really don't want to impose the truth on her.

00:30:37.390 --> 00:30:41.390
So my goal was to help her understand what the Bible teaches.

00:30:41.390 --> 00:30:48.599
Help her see the big picture and let her draw her own conclusion.

00:30:48.599 --> 00:30:54.599
I try and be a good example to her by enjoying the ministry myself.

00:30:54.599 --> 00:30:58.599
And helping her to understand that is I'm out in the ministry.

00:30:58.599 --> 00:31:01.599
I know I'm working along with Jehovah.

00:31:01.599 --> 00:31:07.599
Although she had a high paying job, she wasn't happy.

00:31:07.599 --> 00:31:09.599
She was always stressed.

00:31:09.599 --> 00:31:19.599
When she sees Jehovah's witnesses, despite being out there in the ministry, hot sunny day, rainy day, they are happy.

00:31:19.599 --> 00:31:26.599
She knew and was convinced that she would be really happy if she put Jehovah first in her life.

00:31:26.599 --> 00:31:32.599
So eventually she had to tell her mother-in-law that she had resigned from her employment.

00:31:33.599 --> 00:31:36.599
So her mother-in-law says, and now you resigned.

00:31:36.599 --> 00:31:39.599
So what you're going to do, you're going to go preaching.

00:31:39.599 --> 00:31:45.599
And then she says, the decision that I've made is going to make me happy.

00:31:45.599 --> 00:31:48.599
It's going to make Jehovah happy as well.

00:31:48.599 --> 00:31:57.599
In seeing the big picture, she was able to make a stand for true worship and be on Jehovah's side of universal sovereignty.

00:31:58.599 --> 00:32:01.599
I attended the Pioneer Service School with her.

00:32:01.599 --> 00:32:04.599
You know what really made me happy?

00:32:04.599 --> 00:32:12.599
Is seeing ones like her being happy in doing the same work in helping others come to serve Jehovah.

00:32:12.599 --> 00:32:21.599
And knowing the fact that Jehovah had actually used me in helping others find the truth and serve Jehovah as well.

00:32:28.519 --> 00:32:31.519
To some, Fiji may seem like paradise.

00:32:31.519 --> 00:32:37.519
But as we learned, the people of that beautiful land face the same issues as people everywhere.

00:32:37.519 --> 00:32:42.519
Stress, pressure filled jobs, and an uncertain future.

00:32:42.519 --> 00:32:52.519
As Makareta's student learned, putting Jehovah first is the only guarantee for true lasting happiness.

00:32:52.519 --> 00:32:56.519
Our final destination is South America.

00:32:57.519 --> 00:33:02.519
South America is home to Earth's largest river, the Amazon.

00:33:02.519 --> 00:33:06.519
As well as the driest place, the Atacama Desert.

00:33:06.519 --> 00:33:11.519
Animal life on this continent is rich and diverse.

00:33:11.519 --> 00:33:14.519
Particularly its bird population.

00:33:14.519 --> 00:33:22.519
With some 3,000 species of birds, South America is sometimes called the bird continent.

00:33:22.519 --> 00:33:30.519
More than 400 million people live here, including over 1.7 million Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:33:30.519 --> 00:33:39.359
There's tremendous language diversity in South America.

00:33:39.359 --> 00:33:48.359
Let's visit Bolivia, a country of more than 11 million people, and a wide range of indigenous cultures.

00:33:48.359 --> 00:33:55.359
Bolivia presents unique challenges to our about 28,000 brothers and sisters who live here.

00:33:56.359 --> 00:34:04.359
Their territory includes the towering Andes mountains in the west and rainforests in the north.

00:34:04.359 --> 00:34:12.360
The publishers endure weather that ranges from burning heat and tropical humidity to freezing winds.

00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:21.360
To reach remote territories, they may have to cross rivers and drive for hours on poorly maintained mountain roads.

00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:26.360
Sometimes just a few millimeters or inches from the precipice.

00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:31.360
But how Jehovah's blessing their courageous efforts?

00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:38.360
In the last service year alone, more than 42,000 Bible studies were conducted.

00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:47.360
Here are the 35 publishers and eight regular pioneers of the Norte Ketroa congregation.

00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:53.360
To reach and seek out those who speak Ketroa, the publishers travel long distances.

00:34:53.360 --> 00:35:03.360
Sadly, many of the Ketroa-speaking community have been victims of prejudice and do not receive basic education in their language.

00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:13.360
Our brothers and sisters spend hours helping interested ones learn to read so they can comprehend basic Bible truths.

00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:18.360
Their response to the good news in Bolivia is very positive.

00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:28.360
But as we'll learn in the following report, Bible students frequently face opposition, often from those closest to them.

00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:33.360
When an interested person begins to learn the truth from the Bible,

00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:39.360
at first the family is happy for them and their friends are happy too.

00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:44.360
But when the teachings of the Bible are an opposition to popular customs,

00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:49.360
those family members and friends may become their main source of opposition.

00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:54.360
However, we have also seen many, many blessings from Jehovah.

00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:58.360
For example, although the challenges may be great,

00:35:58.360 --> 00:36:02.360
we see Jehovah's hand working in the lives of each of these individuals

00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:04.360
because they make huge changes.

00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:08.360
They take hold of Jehovah, they see him as their God,

00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:12.360
and they leave behind popular customs and start to make progress.

00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:17.360
It is a beautiful blessing to see a Bible suit and get baptized filled with joy.

00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:25.929
Lydia was a young woman who was very interested in spiritual things.

00:36:25.929 --> 00:36:29.929
But just like anyone that does not study the Bible,

00:36:29.929 --> 00:36:33.929
she had habits that were not pleasing to Jehovah.

00:36:33.929 --> 00:36:36.929
She liked to socialize with her workmates,

00:36:36.929 --> 00:36:41.929
and at times she went out drinking with her friends.

00:36:41.929 --> 00:36:45.929
Sometimes drinking a little too much.

00:36:45.929 --> 00:36:50.929
However, despite that, she was very humble.

00:36:50.929 --> 00:36:53.929
You could see that she was very sincere.

00:36:53.929 --> 00:36:57.929
She appreciated good things.

00:36:57.929 --> 00:37:00.929
After seeing these beautiful qualities in her,

00:37:00.929 --> 00:37:08.929
I said, Jehovah can make other good qualities growing her heart.

00:37:08.929 --> 00:37:12.929
So we set the date to start the study.

00:37:12.929 --> 00:37:18.929
We always try to be consistent and to not miss a study.

00:37:18.929 --> 00:37:22.929
When a publisher does not miss the day and time for the study,

00:37:22.929 --> 00:37:27.929
the devil is not given the opportunity to disrupt it.

00:37:27.929 --> 00:37:32.929
Some teachings Lydia accepted immediately.

00:37:32.929 --> 00:37:36.929
But others took more time.

00:37:36.929 --> 00:37:39.929
Her manner of dress was not appropriate.

00:37:39.929 --> 00:37:44.929
She wore tight clothing and very short skirts.

00:37:44.929 --> 00:37:46.929
How did we correct that?

00:37:46.929 --> 00:37:53.929
By showing her in the Bible that women should dress with modesty and soundness of mind.

00:37:53.929 --> 00:37:56.929
It was not easy, but she did it.

00:37:56.929 --> 00:37:59.929
After that, when she attended meetings,

00:37:59.929 --> 00:38:03.929
she looked like one of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:38:03.929 --> 00:38:05.929
When you plant a literal plant,

00:38:05.929 --> 00:38:09.929
you start to water it and it keeps growing.

00:38:09.929 --> 00:38:14.929
While you're sleeping, you don't know how those changes happen.

00:38:14.929 --> 00:38:18.929
It happens exactly the same way with the Bible student.

00:38:18.929 --> 00:38:25.340
As time passed, Lydia expressed the desire to be baptized.

00:38:26.340 --> 00:38:29.340
After that, she just kept making progress

00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:32.340
and started to serve as a regular pioneer.

00:38:32.340 --> 00:38:36.340
Later, she was invited to serve in Bethel.

00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:42.769
She has been serving in Bethel for 16 years.

00:38:42.769 --> 00:38:47.769
I am one of the 70 persons that lend the truth from Edith.

00:38:47.769 --> 00:38:55.769
Her example helped me to be considerate, insightful,

00:38:55.769 --> 00:39:03.139
and also to be consistent in making disciples.

00:39:03.139 --> 00:39:08.139
Over the years, I have learned so much about disciples making.

00:39:08.139 --> 00:39:12.139
Especially that this work is not ours.

00:39:12.139 --> 00:39:16.860
When Bible students make progress,

00:39:16.860 --> 00:39:22.860
it is thanks to the blessing of Jehovah because he sees their hearts.

00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:26.860
So we're not working for a man.

00:39:26.860 --> 00:39:32.909
We're working for the most high God.

00:39:32.909 --> 00:39:37.909
How encouraging to see ones like Lydia learn the truth

00:39:37.909 --> 00:39:41.909
and with God's help make the needed changes.

00:39:41.909 --> 00:39:45.909
And what joy it continues to bring to her teacher, Edith,

00:39:45.909 --> 00:39:48.909
to see her serving Jehovah today.

00:39:48.909 --> 00:39:52.909
As Edith says, when Bible students make progress,

00:39:52.909 --> 00:39:55.909
it is thanks to the blessing of Jehovah

00:39:55.909 --> 00:39:58.909
because he sees their heart.

00:39:58.909 --> 00:40:01.909
Well, in our time together,

00:40:01.909 --> 00:40:06.909
we've circled the earth to bring you these experiences.

00:40:06.909 --> 00:40:10.909
Did you notice any patterns for joyful disciple making?

00:40:10.909 --> 00:40:14.909
Here are just four patterns that stood out to me.

00:40:14.909 --> 00:40:18.909
We saw that the first step is to seek out all those

00:40:18.909 --> 00:40:23.219
with the right heart condition.

00:40:23.219 --> 00:40:26.219
Our brothers in Nigeria,

00:40:26.219 --> 00:40:29.219
Fiji and Bolivia spread the good news

00:40:29.219 --> 00:40:32.219
despite the great distances,

00:40:32.219 --> 00:40:36.889
poor roads, and extreme weather.

00:40:36.889 --> 00:40:41.889
Gabriel and Joseph teamed up to overcome their disabilities

00:40:41.889 --> 00:40:47.170
and their example inspires us to do more.

00:40:47.170 --> 00:40:50.170
Alex and Annie Doss learn sign language

00:40:50.170 --> 00:40:53.170
and moved more than 500 miles to serve

00:40:54.170 --> 00:40:57.170
where the need was greater.

00:40:57.170 --> 00:41:01.170
Then we saw a second vital element in disciple making,

00:41:01.170 --> 00:41:04.170
the art of teaching.

00:41:04.170 --> 00:41:06.170
We know, for example,

00:41:06.170 --> 00:41:11.170
that helping students to reason on the scriptures is very effective.

00:41:11.170 --> 00:41:14.170
That was the case with Makareta.

00:41:14.170 --> 00:41:16.170
Using the scriptures,

00:41:16.170 --> 00:41:22.449
she helped her student draw her own conclusions about the truth.

00:41:22.449 --> 00:41:27.449
Benjamin and Joanna skillfully used the Bible with Jerry and Jane.

00:41:27.449 --> 00:41:32.449
The power of the scriptures touched their hearts.

00:41:32.449 --> 00:41:34.449
And when opposition came,

00:41:34.449 --> 00:41:38.449
they stood firm because they were convinced

00:41:38.449 --> 00:41:44.139
that they were learning the truth from God's inspired word.

00:41:44.139 --> 00:41:48.139
A third element of disciple making involves helping our students

00:41:48.139 --> 00:41:51.139
to develop good study habits

00:41:51.139 --> 00:41:54.139
and a regular spiritual routine.

00:41:54.139 --> 00:42:00.739
Edith and Lydia made it a goal never to miss a study.

00:42:00.739 --> 00:42:03.739
Beatrice showed creativity,

00:42:03.739 --> 00:42:06.739
developing projects like that big sheet of paper

00:42:06.739 --> 00:42:10.739
to help want to know Jehovah as a real person.

00:42:10.739 --> 00:42:13.739
And fourth, in every experience,

00:42:13.739 --> 00:42:17.739
we saw that disciple making involves love,

00:42:17.739 --> 00:42:20.739
showing genuine love.

00:42:20.739 --> 00:42:23.739
Alex and Annie took some rum to the dentist

00:42:23.739 --> 00:42:27.280
because they love him.

00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:30.280
What motivated Cleetus to study the Bible?

00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:33.280
The joy radiated by Jehovah's people

00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:38.559
and the loving way we treat others.

00:42:38.559 --> 00:42:41.559
Angeline gave up her stressful job

00:42:41.559 --> 00:42:43.559
and put Jehovah first.

00:42:43.559 --> 00:42:44.559
Why?

00:42:44.559 --> 00:42:47.559
Because she observed Jehovah's Witnesses

00:42:47.559 --> 00:42:50.559
who out of self-sacrificing love

00:42:50.559 --> 00:42:52.559
were motivated to preach the good news.

00:42:52.559 --> 00:42:55.559
On hot days and rainy days

00:42:55.559 --> 00:42:59.559
and she especially noted the joy it brought them.

00:42:59.559 --> 00:43:02.869
As you can see,

00:43:02.869 --> 00:43:07.869
the joy of Jehovah comes from sincere efforts to help people

00:43:07.869 --> 00:43:10.869
and Jehovah's blessing on those efforts.

00:43:10.869 --> 00:43:13.869
When you see and hear your brothers and sisters

00:43:13.869 --> 00:43:15.869
heartfelt expressions,

00:43:15.869 --> 00:43:17.869
how does it make you feel?

00:43:17.869 --> 00:43:19.869
Like Paul and Barnabas,

00:43:19.869 --> 00:43:22.869
we too may have challenges along the way.

00:43:22.869 --> 00:43:24.869
Even some setbacks.

00:43:24.869 --> 00:43:27.869
But nothing compares with the deep joy

00:43:27.869 --> 00:43:30.869
and happiness that results from helping others

00:43:30.869 --> 00:43:33.869
come to know and love Jehovah.

00:43:33.869 --> 00:43:36.869
There are still honest hearted ones out there

00:43:36.869 --> 00:43:39.869
and they desperately need the truth.

00:43:39.869 --> 00:43:43.869
Its experiences like the ones we've just listened to

00:43:43.869 --> 00:43:46.869
that help us to see that Jehovah

00:43:46.869 --> 00:43:49.869
is truly speeding up the work.

00:43:49.869 --> 00:43:52.869
The next time you go out in service,

00:43:52.869 --> 00:43:55.869
picture yourself working side by side

00:43:55.869 --> 00:43:59.869
with your brothers and sisters around the world.

00:43:59.869 --> 00:44:02.869
Just as in a search and rescue effort,

00:44:02.869 --> 00:44:06.869
we may feel we're not finding survivors in our area,

00:44:06.869 --> 00:44:09.869
but just one report

00:44:09.869 --> 00:44:12.869
of a rescue victim being pulled out alive

00:44:12.869 --> 00:44:16.869
spurs on all the volunteers to double their efforts.

00:44:17.869 --> 00:44:20.869
Imagine the joy Jehovah feels

00:44:20.869 --> 00:44:25.869
when he looks down and sees us across the globe,

00:44:25.869 --> 00:44:27.869
working shoulder to shoulder

00:44:27.869 --> 00:44:31.869
in the greatest rescue mission of all time.

00:44:31.869 --> 00:44:34.869
So keep calling out.

00:44:34.869 --> 00:44:37.869
Keep searching through the rubble of this dying system

00:44:37.869 --> 00:44:40.869
to find those crying out for help

00:44:40.869 --> 00:44:45.869
and may your joy abound as you do so.
