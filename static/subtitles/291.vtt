00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.800
When our little daughter, BelÃ©n, was nearly three years old, the doctors discovered that

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:16.940
she had a brain tumor.

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:22.660
When her physical condition worsened, as a father, I had to make decisions of what kind

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.140
of treatment she would receive to best take care of her.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.149
And that completely terrified me.

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:39.109
It was like having a lie in front of me, and I felt desperate for a moment.

00:00:39.109 --> 00:00:46.549
I remember that, inside, I shouted to Jehovah to help me.

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:52.350
Through that situation, I learned how to pray to Jehovah.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:01:01.990
And Jehovah never left me, Jehovah guided me, Jehovah helped me make good decisions.

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:07.870
Only through prayer did I understand that what we were facing was too much for us to handle

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:09.189
alone.

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:14.909
We needed Jehovah more than ever.

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:20.790
As a family, we focused on our spiritual routine.

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:30.459
The key to not being afraid of these problems is to trust in the resurrection hope.

00:01:30.459 --> 00:01:37.599
My wife and I were determined to educate our girls with love, also in a way that they

00:01:37.599 --> 00:01:43.180
would truly get to know Jehovah as they grew up.

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:49.180
It was evident that we were leaning on Jehovah, and they did the same.

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:54.819
Belen, when she was going through difficult circumstances, she would say to me, don't

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:57.980
worry, mom, I prayed to Jehovah already.

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:03.859
It made me see that, okay, my daughter has seen Jehovah so real.

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:09.789
There were many moments where she strengthened me.

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:17.189
And even though it's true that Belen fell asleep in death, for me, she came out victorious

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:22.830
because I know she's going to open her eyes in the new world, and the four of us will

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:23.669
be together again.
