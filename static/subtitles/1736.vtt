00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:06.099
Expanding our ministry also requires endurance.

00:00:06.099 --> 00:00:10.099
We may need to learn a new language, a new culture,

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:14.099
and adapt to very different living conditions.

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.100
Consider the example of Denton and Janet Hopkinson.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:24.100
Brother Hopkinson currently serves as a member of the Philippines Branch Committee.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:29.100
He was baptized in 1943 and has served in the Philippines

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:36.100
for more than 60 years and Sister Hopkinson for more than 50 years.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:41.100
What challenges have they faced and what has helped them to endure?

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.840
Let's find out.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.840
My mother learned the truth from a neighbor.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.840
I was 10 years old when I was baptized.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:59.310
But then I became a pioneer when I was 16 years of age.

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:04.310
My father and I were baptized at the same circuit assembly in October of 1950.

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:07.310
And at that time I was 11 years old.

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:14.310
I set a date after I finished high school to go into my pioneering and that's what I did.

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.310
Later on of course I got an application to attend the 35th class of Gilead.

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.310
And I was still 20 at the time.

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.310
After I had been pioneering for about three years,

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.310
I was called up for compulsory military service.

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.310
Of course I refused to accept that.

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.310
But the judge sentenced me to six months in prison.

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:44.310
And while I was in prison, the application for Gilead was approved and the invitation came.

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.310
Gilead was a wonderful experience.

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:54.310
And when we arrived in the Philippines, we did not expect ever to return to our home country.

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.310
Coming to the Philippines as the first port of call,

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.310
it was the first time that I met Denton.

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.310
But my partner and I were going to Thailand.

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.310
Arriving in Thailand was quite a change.

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.310
Coming from a cold country, it was hot.

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.310
So that was a challenge to get used to.

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.310
Brother Leech, my partner and I,

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.310
we didn't learn much of the language in the first few months.

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:29.310
So I did try to learn by comparing the Let God Be True book in English

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.310
with the Let God Be True book in Tagalog.

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:38.310
But that wasn't so easy because the grammar is so much different to English.

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.310
After six months in the Philippines,

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:47.310
and we found a pile of letters on our desk in our room.

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.310
And that was our assignment to go into the circuit work.

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.310
This was really a challenge for me.

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.310
It's something new.

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.310
I was only 22 years old at that time.

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.310
I remember one time I went to a congregation and they showed me my room.

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.310
It was just a plain room.

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:05.310
It was a new house.

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.310
Just newly built.

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.310
But it was just a wooden floor and four walls.

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.310
And that was it.

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.310
And in the corner, a banic sleeping mat.

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.310
In some cases, there was a toilet.

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.310
Outside the house, mostly outside the house.

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.310
But in some cases, there was no toilet at all.

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:34.310
So you just had to find your own way into the nearby countryside.

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:40.650
After about two and a half years in the circuit work,

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.650
then I received the letter assigning me a district overseer.

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.650
And then oftentimes we have to travel by bus in some remote areas.

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.650
I remember one time in Masbati.

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.650
The road was so rough and it was long.

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:00.650
It was much more difficult than it was in the circuit work.

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.650
I had no vehicle to travel in.

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.650
It was mostly public transportation.

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:10.650
I've never owned a car in my life.

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.650
It was while I was serving in the district work

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:19.649
that I received the letter telling me to come to Bethel.

00:04:19.649 --> 00:04:23.649
When I came to Bethel, brother Stuart, the branch servant told me

00:04:23.649 --> 00:04:27.649
that I was to look after his work while he was away traveling

00:04:27.649 --> 00:04:31.649
to visit various countries in the zone work.

00:04:31.649 --> 00:04:35.649
And I was really felt completely unprepared

00:04:35.649 --> 00:04:39.649
and unqualified for that kind of work at that time.

00:04:39.649 --> 00:04:42.649
After I was in Thailand for four years,

00:04:42.649 --> 00:04:45.649
Denton and I had decided to get married

00:04:45.649 --> 00:04:49.649
and brother Nor had agreed that I would be the one to be reassigned

00:04:49.649 --> 00:04:51.649
to the Philippines.

00:04:51.649 --> 00:04:56.540
And we were married in 1965.

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:00.540
I have found that whatever assignment you're given in Jehovah's organization,

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:02.540
although it seems intimidating,

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:05.540
it seems to be difficult at the start.

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:08.540
But if you accept it and trust in Jehovah

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:11.540
and don't approach it as if you know everything

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:15.540
or you can do it yourself, but really trust in Jehovah to help you,

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:17.540
then you can succeed.

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:19.540
The Jehovah's help.

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:21.540
We can all have the privilege of serving him

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:24.540
and can all get the help of the Holy Spirit

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:27.540
to continue to serve him faithfully.

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:33.540
Sometimes brothers ask me how I was able to endure that long

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:36.540
for 60 years in missionary service.

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:43.540
But I believe it is being willing to endure problems

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:47.540
with the hope that things will improve as time goes by.

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:50.540
And Jehovah himself will give us a strength.
