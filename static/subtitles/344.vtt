00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:05.879
When you look at the words in the way that the Apostle Paul worded things

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:13.119
He said I live by the faith in the Son of God who loved me and handed himself over for me

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:18.420
And we can really see the very personal nature of the ransom to the Apostle Paul

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.620
And it's important for us to do as our commenters pointed out nicely

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:29.679
It is important for us to personalize the ransom the Apostle Paul and Hebrews chapter 6 and verse 5

00:00:30.559 --> 00:00:32.560
I showed the very personal nature

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:37.280
He understood the personal nature of the Bible and the ransom

00:00:37.759 --> 00:00:41.920
In Hebrews chapter 6 and verse 5 he uses this expression

00:00:42.679 --> 00:00:48.240
And who have tasted the fine word of God and powers of the coming system of things

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:55.060
It's interesting. He used the word taste. Taste is something very personal. Somebody can't taste something for you

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:58.880
You have to put it in your mouth in order to really know what it's going to taste like

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:06.560
So too with the ransom and what practical ways can we taste or personalize the ransom for us

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.560
Let's just consider a couple this morning

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.120
One is personal fears

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.840
Does God really love me?

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.840
Am I worthy of love?

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:20.560
Sometimes the what ifs and their cousins the could be is they come to live and never leave

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.920
You know bad things or trials or difficulties happen to us

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:29.280
We begin to reason well. Jehovah God maybe doesn't love me

00:01:30.239 --> 00:01:34.000
There's a really strong reason for us to somehow believe in cause and effect

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.719
We see the cause of things and effect and so after a while

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.359
Everything that happens to us we begin to look at some cause and even begin to think that maybe Jehovah doesn't

00:01:43.599 --> 00:01:45.599
Allah's love us

00:01:45.599 --> 00:01:50.400
You can even if we're a good person and bad things happen to us. We begin to wonder

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:52.959
Others my age are healthy

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:00.079
Some leaving or changing assignments you hear everything falls into place for them within a few weeks

00:02:00.879 --> 00:02:03.840
I'm still looking for a job. I'm still looking for work

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:11.280
Another is not try to reason that just because things don't work out perfectly that Jehovah doesn't love us

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.719
It's not true

00:02:12.719 --> 00:02:17.919
We can still be doing very very good things and yet some difficulties can face us

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.520
For example, you're driving down the road of being all the traffic laws you pull up to

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:28.719
Red light you stop turns green you go through it and you get broadsided by some

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.919
Knucklehead who went through the red light on the other side

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:34.719
Well, that's not your fault

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.680
Are you going to say well? I you know what? I'm not going to be traffic laws anymore. See it doesn't pay

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:46.400
Well, no it was it was his fault for running through the traffic lights and sometimes

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:53.680
Bad or difficult things can happen to us. It's not our fault or it's not any sign that Jehovah doesn't love us

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.800
So how can reflecting on the ransom help us when we have these kinds of personal fears?

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.759
Well, we could start with why do we have the ransom?

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:07.039
Well because some very good bad things were happening to some good people us

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Adam and Eve descendant

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.319
I mean Adam's in and Eve's in

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.800
Yet we suffer

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.800
The ransom is Jehovah's solution for those who appreciate it

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:24.960
It's his way of telling us I know bad things are happening and I'm working to fix it

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.400
Yes, when we reflect on the reason why Jehovah God gave us the ransom

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:38.639
It helps us to know that Jehovah knows we suffer from cancer and old age and the sins and mistakes of others and even our own imperfections

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:42.639
See tasting of the ransom in this way means

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:48.719
Will not get the feeling that Jehovah doesn't love us when trials befall us to the contrary

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.680
The ransom is the greatest expression of Jehovah and Jesus love for us

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.439
And their desire to fix the current mess we live in now

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:05.199
How about let's consider a second way that we could reflect on the ransom and that is the death of someone close to us

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:15.520
Anyone who's had someone very close to them die knows the very helpless feeling that you have knowing that there's really nothing you can do

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.360
In that instant when they die your hope your faith in the resurrection

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.600
based on the ransom

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.199
Become more real to you than anytime in your entire life

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.560
In Acts chapter 17 and verse 31

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:34.079
In a beautiful speech that the Apostle Paul gave

00:04:34.959 --> 00:04:37.759
He highlights that Jesus

00:04:38.959 --> 00:04:43.199
Death and resurrection and the ransom was really a guarantee that we have

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.279
Here in Acts chapter 17 and verse 31

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.519
He says because he has set a day on which he purposes to judge the inhabited earth in righteousness

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.160
by a man whom he has appointed

00:04:56.959 --> 00:05:00.399
And he's provided a guarantee to all men

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.120
by resurrecting him

00:05:03.279 --> 00:05:05.120
from the dead

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:08.639
So personalizing the ransom all that it makes possible

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.399
Helps us to know that the resurrection is just not possible

00:05:12.959 --> 00:05:17.279
But that Jehovah and Jesus want to resurrect our mother our father

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.560
Our beloved husband or a wife

00:05:21.519 --> 00:05:26.480
They care about each person that has ever lived or died

00:05:27.439 --> 00:05:33.759
Know them so intimately and so completely that they can resurrect them completely with all their memories and personality

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:35.920
Completely as we knew them

00:05:36.319 --> 00:05:41.279
I mean how much more personal could God's love for us become than that

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.959
You know to bring our loved ones back from the dead

00:05:45.759 --> 00:05:49.519
Is the ultimate statement of Jehovah's personal

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.839
Interest in each and every human being

00:05:55.199 --> 00:06:00.240
We are not just collateral damage in Satan's war on Jehovah

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:10.000
The ransom is the way that Jehovah plans to undo all the harm that Satan has caused since the death of Adam and Eve

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:14.480
In fact the resurrection is really Jehovah's wave

00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:18.399
Proving all of Satan's lies completely a false

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:24.560
When you think about it today Satan can portray all kinds of lies about what happens to people after they die

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.360
They're going to go here. They're going to go there. They're going to go to some afterlife

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:30.800
They're going to go to some paradise. They're going to be come back as some animal

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.680
But in the new world

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:38.240
When the vast majority of people being resurrected are I've been resurrected

00:06:39.199 --> 00:06:41.199
That lie isn't going to be sold anymore

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:45.759
Each one can tell everyone what happened to them when they died

00:06:46.959 --> 00:06:49.579
Nothing

00:06:49.579 --> 00:06:51.500
No afterlife

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:54.300
Everyone will know that it's non-existence

00:06:55.259 --> 00:06:57.259
That lie won't work

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:59.500
See Jehovah knew

00:06:59.819 --> 00:07:03.819
That we would hurt terribly at the death of loved ones

00:07:04.779 --> 00:07:06.779
So he gave us the ransom

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:10.459
As his way of telling us I know it hurts

00:07:11.339 --> 00:07:16.139
But please know that I have the perfect solution in mind

00:07:17.259 --> 00:07:24.459
Now we've just considered two ways to reflect and meditate on the ransom like the apostle ball did to really personalize it

00:07:24.779 --> 00:07:27.420
we just talked about personal fears and

00:07:29.259 --> 00:07:31.980
The resurrection the death of someone close to us

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:35.899
Imagine how many more ways we can benefit

00:07:36.779 --> 00:07:41.259
Today from meditating on the ransom and how it affects us

00:07:41.899 --> 00:07:43.899
personally
