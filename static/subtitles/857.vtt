00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:07.200
Brother Jeffrey Jackson will discuss the theme, don't be surprised by sudden changes.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:13.019
Brother Jeff, you have a attention.

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.019
Well, I'm sure we all agree with this fact.

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:21.019
In recent years, there have been a lot of changes.

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:27.019
Even since the last annual meeting, there have been many changes.

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:32.020
Some of them, perhaps, are little surprising or may seem to be sudden.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:38.020
But you know, brothers and sisters, when we look back on how these changes have come,

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:44.020
we can see the job has gradually prepared us for each of these adjustments and changes.

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.020
Let's review some of the recent changes we've had.

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:55.700
What changes have we seen with regard to our understanding of Bible teachings?

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:02.700
At the 2021 annual meeting, we received an adjusted understanding of John 529.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:09.700
It was explained that the resurrection of judgment will not be a judgment of condemnation.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.700
Rather, it will be more like a period of probation.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:21.700
The unrighteous mention at Acts 24-15 will have an opportunity to gain everlasting life.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:27.700
But their names will not be written in the book of life at the time of their resurrection.

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:34.700
To have their names eventually written in that book, these ones will need to respond positively

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:40.700
to the great educational work that will take place during the thousand-year reign.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:48.700
Then, at the annual meeting in 2023, we gained enhanced insight into what we do know

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.700
and what we don't know concerning Jehovah's judgments.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.700
We learned that the door of opportunity for people to take a stand for the kingdom

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.700
does not shut when the Great Tribulation starts with the destruction of false religion.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.700
At that time, perhaps some will be like the Egyptians in Moses' day,

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.699
who took a last-minute stand and joined the Exodus of God's people.

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:18.699
At the same annual meeting, we adjusted our views with regard to Jehovah's judgments

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:23.699
of those who died in the flood and those who were destroyed in Sodom and Gomorrah.

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:29.699
Also, at that annual meeting, an adjustment was made regarding the reporting of our time

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:31.699
and activity and our preaching work.

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:38.699
Instead of focusing on reports, we tried to make good use of every opportunity to witness.

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:44.699
Then we received the 2024 governing body update, number two.

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:50.699
In that update, we saw the need to adjust how we interact with those who have committed serious sins

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:53.699
and have been removed from the congregation.

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:57.699
What other major adjustments have we recently seen?

00:02:57.699 --> 00:03:04.699
In our preaching work, the emphasis now is on studying Bible studies and making disciples,

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:07.699
not on distributing literature.

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:12.699
To that end, the focus is on studying meaningful conversations,

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:16.699
not just on using memorized presentations.

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:21.699
Were you surprised by these adjustments? Perhaps so.

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:26.699
But as we look back, we see how one adjustment in understanding

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:32.210
gradually helped us with the next adjustment.

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:36.210
Isn't it true that gradually Jehovah has prepared us?

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:43.210
And when we look back on it, we see how logical this training has been to refine our understanding.

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:48.210
But events in the world likewise have changed.

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:55.210
It's true sometimes in the world you have sudden changes, for example, the pandemic.

00:03:55.210 --> 00:04:00.210
But oftentimes, change in the world is gradual.

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:08.210
Isn't it true with regard to the view of morality, homosexuality, abortion?

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:13.210
Even what's acceptable and not acceptable with regard to conduct.

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:17.209
All of that has happened gradually in the world.

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:24.209
And it's not until you look back and see how different the world is today with regard to those matters

00:04:24.209 --> 00:04:28.209
that we see that there have been a lot of changes.

00:04:28.209 --> 00:04:30.209
But this can be dangerous.

00:04:30.209 --> 00:04:38.209
Because as things gradually change, we may get used to gradual change

00:04:38.209 --> 00:04:45.209
and forget that there are some sudden changes about to occur.

00:04:45.209 --> 00:04:47.209
Let's take our Bible, please.

00:04:47.209 --> 00:04:52.209
And if you turn with me to the book of Luke chapter 21.

00:04:52.209 --> 00:04:57.209
Now, this is an example of sudden change.

00:04:57.209 --> 00:05:04.209
In Luke chapter 21, notice there in verse 34, the words of our Lord Jesus have recorded.

00:05:04.209 --> 00:05:07.209
And He said in verse 34,

00:05:07.209 --> 00:05:15.209
but pay attention to yourselves that your hearts never become weighed down with overeating and heavy drinking

00:05:15.209 --> 00:05:17.209
and anxieties of life.

00:05:17.209 --> 00:05:30.209
And suddenly, suddenly, that they be instantly, instantly upon you.

00:05:30.209 --> 00:05:36.209
It's interesting to note that Jesus had already said that this day He was referring to

00:05:36.209 --> 00:05:40.209
would occur at a time that we don't think is likely.

00:05:40.209 --> 00:05:45.209
So what lesson do we learn from what Jesus said?

00:05:45.209 --> 00:05:47.209
It's a warning, isn't it?

00:05:47.209 --> 00:05:51.209
That we can't just sit back and think, well, things are gradually going to develop.

00:05:51.209 --> 00:05:53.209
We know which way it's going.

00:05:53.209 --> 00:05:56.209
And maybe it's not going to happen yet.

00:05:56.209 --> 00:06:01.209
We've got a little bit more wiggle room there with regard to the schedule.

00:06:01.209 --> 00:06:04.209
But you see, that's dangerous thinking.

00:06:04.209 --> 00:06:13.209
Now, what we're going to do is consider two examples of areas where perhaps we could be a little guilty with regard to that.

00:06:13.209 --> 00:06:21.209
For example, our view with regard to the number of anointed ones remaining on the earth.

00:06:21.209 --> 00:06:24.209
Now, for many years, what did we think?

00:06:24.209 --> 00:06:30.209
We thought, well, that number would go down and down and down and down.

00:06:30.209 --> 00:06:32.209
Now, I don't know about you, but me.

00:06:32.209 --> 00:06:37.209
When that report came out, just how many, how many partakers?

00:06:37.209 --> 00:06:40.209
And what were we thinking?

00:06:40.209 --> 00:06:47.209
Well, probably, maybe we didn't say it, but we think the number will go down, down, down, down, down.

00:06:47.209 --> 00:06:52.209
And there'll be just a couple of old guys in a wheelchair.

00:06:52.209 --> 00:06:56.209
Who will get that reward?

00:06:56.209 --> 00:07:01.209
Well, I'm exaggerating, but that was sort of the feeling, wasn't it?

00:07:01.209 --> 00:07:05.209
But now, what have we seen in recent years?

00:07:05.209 --> 00:07:10.209
Those numbers have gone up and up.

00:07:10.209 --> 00:07:15.209
And not only that younger brothers have been appointed on the governing body.

00:07:15.209 --> 00:07:20.209
Now, I know what you're all thinking to nuance, how old are they?

00:07:20.209 --> 00:07:28.209
We know you're not Googling now, but you will be.

00:07:28.209 --> 00:07:35.209
You see, we need to be careful about what we're thinking with regard to the number of unknown ones left on earth.

00:07:35.209 --> 00:07:43.209
You see, 19 years ago, I was appointed on the governing body, even I thought I was too young.

00:07:43.209 --> 00:07:46.209
Now, they tell me I'm not so young anymore.

00:07:46.209 --> 00:07:54.459
But do we see the point, what does the Bible actually tell us with regard to this?

00:07:54.459 --> 00:08:01.459
Well, it doesn't say the number would just dwindle down to just having a few older ones left.

00:08:01.459 --> 00:08:09.459
No. The great crowd of other sheep will be judged on the basis of how they deal with Christ's brothers.

00:08:09.459 --> 00:08:15.459
So that means the faithful and discreet slave, as well as all the anointed throughout the earth,

00:08:15.459 --> 00:08:22.459
will continue to be active in doing the work and wanting and needing your support.

00:08:22.459 --> 00:08:29.459
Try it up until the time that suddenly they will be reassigned.

00:08:29.459 --> 00:08:34.460
And isn't that what Matthew 24 verse 31 says?

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:40.460
There will be a gathering, the final gathering of the anointed from all different parts of the earth.

00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:47.460
So for us to think, well, there's some ones on the governing body, they don't look too old.

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:50.460
Maybe we've got a little bit extra time.

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:57.460
Now, Jehovah is making sure that the faithful and discreet slave is continuing to work

00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:02.460
and is effective right up until that time of reassignment.

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:04.460
So that's one subject.

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:11.460
The second subject we'd like to talk about is our view with regard to the start of the great tribulation,

00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:15.460
with the destruction of Babylon the Great.

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:19.460
We look through the scriptures in Revelation chapter 16.

00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:24.460
What does it tell us that the waters would gradually dry up?

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:30.460
Yes, churches are losing support in some countries, for example, Europe.

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:35.460
It wasn't that long ago that most nations in Europe were very religious,

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:40.460
but now people are turning their backs on religion.

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:47.460
But at the same time, when we look at Africa and South America,

00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:51.460
we see that religion still has a strong influence.

00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:55.460
So now, what could be that little voice in our mind saying?

00:09:55.460 --> 00:10:02.460
Well, yeah, we see it's going in the right direction, but maybe not just yet.

00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:05.460
We've got a little bit more time left.

00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:09.460
But again, we need to remember what the scriptures tell us.

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:15.460
And if you turn with me this time, please, to Revelation chapter 17.

00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:21.460
This is one of the chapters that describes the destruction of false religion,

00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:24.460
or in other words, when the Great Tribulation starts.

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:31.460
So let's read Revelation 17 and verse 17, and note, please, what it tells us.

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:36.460
For God put it into their hearts to carry out His thought,

00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:41.460
yes, to carry out their one thought by giving the kingdom to the wild beast

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:45.460
until the words of God will have been accomplished.

00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:49.460
Now, what is this one thought?

00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:57.460
Well, up to now, we've said the one thought is their desire to turn on false religion.

00:10:57.460 --> 00:11:04.460
And we can understand that because the context is talking about the destruction of false religion.

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:10.460
But you see, if you look back at that verse, what is the one thought?

00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:16.460
Now, this means we have to adjust our understanding, another change.

00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:18.460
What does it say?

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:25.460
The one thought refers to the nations being willing to hand over power,

00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:31.460
their political power, to the scarlet colored wild beast, the United Nations.

00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:37.460
Let me repeat it, because you're in shock now, and you need to write this down.

00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:46.460
The one thought refers to the nations being willing to hand over power to the United Nations.

00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:49.460
Now, why is that exciting?

00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:55.460
Well, the fact that nations will eventually turn on religion really isn't that surprising.

00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:58.460
Gradually, we've seen that happening.

00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:01.460
We say, yes, we see which way it's going.

00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:09.460
But what about nations empowering the United Nations, handing over their personal political power

00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:12.460
so that the United Nations has more power?

00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:14.460
It has teeth, as it were.

00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:19.460
At the moment, it's like a toothless, toothless organization, isn't it?

00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:22.460
That seems unbelievable.

00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:24.460
No nation does that.

00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:27.460
But what is it that happens?

00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:30.460
It is an act of God.

00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:37.460
Jehovah puts that one thought into the minds of the nations.

00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:49.460
Yes, they will empower the United Nations so that the United Nations will be in a position to take action against false religion.

00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:57.460
Now, this adjustment in understanding also means that we have to adjust our understanding of verses 12 and 13.

00:12:57.460 --> 00:13:03.460
So if you're in Revelation 17, please let's look at verses 12 and 13.

00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:12.460
The ten horns that you saw mean ten kings who have not yet received the kingdom.

00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:19.460
They do receive authority as kings for one hour with a wild beast.

00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:27.460
These have one thought so they give their power and authority to the wild beast.

00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:37.460
So up to now, we've assumed these ten kings, which represent all the political powers and governments in the world at the moment,

00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:45.460
that they did this during the last days by supporting, first of all, the League of Nations and then the United Nations.

00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:48.460
But now, what do we understand this to be?

00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:51.460
See, we understand verse 17.

00:13:51.460 --> 00:14:03.460
Well, there will come a time when all political powers on earth, which includes many who have never been part of the seven world powers,

00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:15.460
they will see that they need to collectively pull their power by giving it to the United Nations to try and solve some of the problems in the world.

00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:21.460
And they will rule notice, what does this say, for one hour, just a short period of time.

00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:38.460
So this newly empowered United Nations from that time on will rule collectively for a short time, but it will enable them to destroy false religion and fight against Jesus and Jehovah's people.

00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:51.379
Now, isn't that exciting?

00:14:51.379 --> 00:14:56.379
Now, we're back to our subject again. You see, gradually things happen.

00:14:56.379 --> 00:15:04.379
So we might say, well, yes, gradually I see battle on the greats losing influence in some places, maybe not yet.

00:15:04.379 --> 00:15:10.379
But don't expect that you see governments gradually wanting to give over power.

00:15:10.379 --> 00:15:15.379
They don't want to do that. It takes an act of God.

00:15:15.379 --> 00:15:18.379
Jehovah will put it into their hearts.

00:15:18.379 --> 00:15:25.379
This will occur with suddenness. Yes, then the Great Tribulation will start.

00:15:25.379 --> 00:15:29.379
A sudden change, not something that happens gradually.

00:15:29.379 --> 00:15:35.379
So what have we learned in our discussion? Well, yes, some things change gradually.

00:15:35.379 --> 00:15:42.379
But brothers and sisters, remember, there are some sudden things that are about to occur.

00:15:42.379 --> 00:15:55.379
Let's remember the two things as a reminder. First of all, the remaining anointed ones will suddenly be taken to heaven while they are still very active.

00:15:55.379 --> 00:16:04.379
The second one, Jehovah will suddenly move the nations to give their political power to the United Nations.

00:16:04.379 --> 00:16:12.379
So what's the takeaway? Don't be complacent. Don't think, oh, this is going to gradually change.

00:16:12.379 --> 00:16:21.379
No, some things won't gradually change. They will occur suddenly as acts of God.

00:16:21.379 --> 00:16:25.379
So be ready and don't be surprised by sudden change.
