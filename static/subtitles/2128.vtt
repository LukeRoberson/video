00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:15.369
I started attending meetings and studying the Bible when I was 5 years old.

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:19.929
When I was 13, I decided to get baptized.

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:25.210
I decided to dedicate my life to Jehovah when I was 14.

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.410
To me, Jehovah is a wonderful God.

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:33.210
He's not just a friend, you can count home, but also a father.

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:40.159
I don't have a spiritual father here on earth, but I have Jehovah as my father.

00:00:40.159 --> 00:00:42.719
It was always something that I had in mind.

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.960
To let the truth convince me that not to serve Jehovah just because my family does.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.280
To serve Jehovah because of the love I feel for him,

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:56.960
having that clearly in mind is very important and will make all the difference when a problem arises.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.880
Or we have to deal with something in the future.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:08.159
Some of the truths that convinced me that Jehovah was really my God were mainly basic truths.

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.480
I believe that they're like the foundation of a house.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:19.159
Without a good base, good foundation, a house will not remain standing.

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:25.319
For example, I wanted to understand better from a more scientific standpoint

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:28.519
that Jehovah really created all things.

00:01:28.519 --> 00:01:32.359
So I read a lesson from the brochure origin of life.

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:38.480
From that, I saw how Jehovah really made everything in a very complex way

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.560
and that there was no other explanation.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.840
It was doubts like that that moved me to study the Bible more

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.359
and helped me to build a better friendship with Jehovah

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:54.599
and to be more convinced that he was the true God.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.719
I always enjoyed and made a great effort to feed myself in a spiritual sense in the morning.

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:05.359
When I was a teenager, I went through some problems that were pretty tough.

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:07.239
I felt better in the morning.

00:02:07.239 --> 00:02:13.120
It was a time of day when my problems didn't seem so big in my mind.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.319
It's very important to have spiritual goals

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:23.360
because if we don't have goals, it's like going on a journey with no direction, no destination.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.879
If you've got a purpose before leaving, we know where we're going

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:28.639
and how we can get there safely.

00:02:28.639 --> 00:02:34.879
I always think in terms of setting short-range goals, medium-range goals, and long-range goals.

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:39.919
So some goals that I was able to reach were getting baptized and becoming a regular pioneer.

00:02:39.919 --> 00:02:46.039
I also had the privilege of serving in construction groups, no matter the choices I had to make.

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:50.479
I always thought about how they would affect my goals in the future.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:55.360
When I was 17, I found out that my mum had to cancer.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.680
It was a heartbreaking situation.

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.919
Suddenly, my life was turned upside down.

00:03:02.919 --> 00:03:06.719
I had to learn how to care for a home, how to cook,

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:08.800
how to care for someone sick,

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.120
and how to give emotional support to that person.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.479
The biggest challenge I faced when I was a teenager

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.360
was when my parents got divorced,

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.560
and then my mum stopped serving Jehovah.

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.960
At that time in my life, I was 15, 16 years old.

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:31.199
At that age, you need a lot of support and guidance from your parents.

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:35.280
It was a time when I didn't get that guidance, that support.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:41.460
My mum was my best friend, and I lost her.

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:44.819
She was always so loving.

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:47.580
She always helped me.

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.780
She always read the publications with me.

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:56.509
We love to study the Bible together.

00:03:56.509 --> 00:04:01.750
We don't know when problems will suddenly come up,

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:06.030
so it's important that we take Jehovah's side before the challenges,

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.120
before problems arise.

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:15.639
A text that really helped me was Romans 8, verse 37 to 39.

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:21.040
There it says that neither death, nor life, nor height, nor depth,

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:24.879
not anything else can separate us from Jehovah's love,

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:28.600
so that really helped me face those challenges.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:35.600
Having a strong Christian identity means having values and principles

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.759
that are the same as Jehovah's.

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:42.120
You clearly make up your mind to please Jehovah,

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.319
even with what's happening all around you.

00:04:45.319 --> 00:04:48.079
It's very important to make the choice to serve Jehovah

00:04:48.079 --> 00:04:50.920
and no matter the situation we face,

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:55.759
no matter if our family serves Jehovah or not.

00:04:55.759 --> 00:04:58.240
Because it's when we face challenging situations

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.120
that we'll see if we can continue to be loyal to Jehovah or not.

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.639
No doubt about it.

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:07.240
I'm very proud to be one of Jehovah's witnesses.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.920
Jehovah can help us in an amazing way.

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:16.040
He's our friend, our father, our comforter,

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:20.199
and it's really good to be friends with a God that is so powerful

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:22.839
and have the chance to defend his name.
