00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:09.490
There were signs of stones,

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:15.089
petrol bombs, people screaming.

00:00:17.329 --> 00:00:19.329
Those were the signs we grew up with.

00:00:19.329 --> 00:00:24.210
Back then I was raised as a Catholic

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:31.010
in an area which became known for the troubles that began there.

00:00:32.289 --> 00:00:34.450
We were a very divided city.

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.649
It was Catholic nationalist and unionist Protestant.

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.890
A close friend had been, he had been in the wrong place at the wrong time.

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:56.380
After the funeral, I went to the chapel and knelt down and addressed God directly.

00:00:58.299 --> 00:01:08.980
There has been far too much death and it can't go on, but I promised you

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:13.459
I will be the best Catholic I can be.

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.019
Would you need to give me some answers?

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:26.799
I went back home and was trying to be a good Catholic

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:30.879
and Jehovah's people knocked at the door.

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:38.959
My husband had a short story because I had made an agreement with God.

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:43.439
I would stay in the kitchen but with the door open.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:52.480
I heard the young couple back then and they used a name I had never heard before.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.120
It was God's personal name.

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.200
While my husband decided that this was not for him.

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:08.819
But I remember popping my head through the door and going, but I am the hope that all those people,

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:18.530
all those peers, all the burials that we had had would be reversed.

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:27.460
I was baptized in 1985 and while it was lovely to be one of Jehovah's people,

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:36.900
when you looked around and realized none of Jehovah's people lived here, I felt so isolated.

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:48.939
Violence was something that could break out in certain areas, but almost any day.

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:59.500
We're talking sniper fire, we're talking civil unrest, coming from a Catholic,

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:05.259
Republican background, I would have feared going into some areas.

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:12.500
There were places that I would never have been but for the truth.

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:18.099
Jehovah's people had come to my door personally, knocked on it,

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:22.900
were aware of the dangers around them and that in turn,

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:26.659
would have faded me to do the same thing.

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:36.620
One day on the monastery, I knocked on the door and man opened the door.

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:46.379
But I noticed he looked hyper-vigilant and I thought there's something not right here.

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:56.379
So I had my Bible and I offered him the watchtower and immediately his face relaxed and he said,

00:03:56.379 --> 00:04:03.979
oh my wife reached those magazines just a second and as he passed the table on the hall,

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:16.079
he simply put a revolver on the table. At that time, I realized that Jehovah is not a God,

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:27.519
who is prejudice. I'm more integrated with the congregation and the fear of working in other

00:04:27.519 --> 00:04:34.639
territories that I would never have been in has gone. Jehovah widened your world.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:45.279
Jehovah gives you a reason to get up in the morning, put on your coat, walk out the front door

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:58.240
and the happiness of bringing good news. It's a wonderful feeling to know that in the time

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:07.360
you buried Jehovah's name, something to be very proud of, something to be absolutely proud of.
