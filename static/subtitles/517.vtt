00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:08.140
Now, today's Watchtower comments, focus on compassion, which is an aspect of the quality

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:09.140
of love.

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:16.140
Now, you will agree that we can express our love and compassion in many different ways

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:20.539
to one another, small and great.

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:25.260
With that thought in mind, how would you answer this question?

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:32.380
What is the greatest expression of love and compassion ever show?

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:40.420
No doubt you will answer Jehovah giving his son as a ransom.

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:45.140
And indeed, we cannot thank Jehovah enough for the ransom arrangements.

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:51.859
Now, that being the case, let us use today's morning worship comments to highlight the

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:57.539
connection between compassion and the ransom.

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.780
Now to do so, we will consider these questions.

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:07.700
How does Jehovah show his love and compassion through the ransom?

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:15.299
And how does the ransom emphasize why we should show love and compassion?

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:21.819
To answer, let us go back to the time that Adam and Eve were without sin.

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:26.340
At that time, they had a close relationship with their Heavenly Father.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.780
Jehovah regularly spoke to them, likely by means of his son.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:38.540
However, Adam and Eve disobeyed Jehovah and sin overshadowed them.

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:44.459
How did that rebellious act affect their relationship with Jehovah?

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:52.060
It was as if a wall or barrier crashed into it and destroyed it.

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.099
Now what was Jehovah's reaction to the rebellion of Adam and Eve?

00:01:57.099 --> 00:02:02.379
It is described that Isaiah 59 verse 2.

00:02:02.379 --> 00:02:08.979
Now although Isaiah wrote these words many years after the time of Adam, they described

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:14.020
Jehovah's timeless reaction to disobedience.

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.099
Isaiah 59, 2.

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:22.139
Your own errors have separated you from your gods.

00:02:22.139 --> 00:02:30.939
Your sins have made him hide his face from you and he refuses to hear you.

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:34.139
Now the inside book explains that the expression,

00:02:34.139 --> 00:02:39.939
hide his face signifies that Jehovah withdrew his favor.

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:45.139
And that is exactly what Jehovah did in the case of Adam and Eve.

00:02:45.139 --> 00:02:52.020
Jehovah withdrew his favor and the father-child relationship was blocked.

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.259
And how did that wall affect the children of Adam and Eve?

00:02:56.259 --> 00:03:02.219
All descendants of Adam and Eve were born on the wrong side of the wall, so to speak,

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:06.740
and since no imperfect human had the ability to scale that wall,

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:13.900
all mankind was left without hope, captive to sin and death.

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.340
Now if Jehovah would have left that situation as it was,

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.539
he would have acted justly because the wages sinned pace his death.

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:29.740
However, out of his love and compassion for the offspring of Adam and Eve,

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:33.020
what did Jehovah do?

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:42.259
To answer, let us illustrate how Jehovah made it possible for us to be brought back into a relationship with him.

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:46.259
Let's think of the face of a clock.

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:53.180
For the sake of illustration, imagine that Jehovah resides at 12 o'clock.

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:54.939
And where are we?

00:03:54.939 --> 00:03:59.099
Well, since we are born as sinners, we are far away from Jehovah,

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:03.659
so we can put our name at 6 o'clock.

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:11.620
Now to see what happens next, let us read several verses in 1 John chapter 4.

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:19.339
Note what the Apostle John states at 1 John 4, 10, the first part of the verse.

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:25.420
The love is in disrespect, not that we have loved God,

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:27.980
but that he loved us.

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:35.500
And then verse 19, we love because he first loved us.

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:41.379
Now these verses tell us that Jehovah moved by his love and compassion for us,

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:47.300
took the needed steps to finalize the arrangement to come to our rescue.

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:55.139
In order to reach us, he made a deep tour as it were around that wall.

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.259
However, as stated that Habakkuk 113,

00:04:59.259 --> 00:05:04.259
Jehovah's eyes are too pure to look onto what is evil.

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:07.339
Therefore, Jehovah needed to cover our sins.

00:05:07.339 --> 00:05:11.100
And as we remember, the word atonement, as used in the Bible,

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.379
means covering of sins.

00:05:14.379 --> 00:05:20.100
So to provide that needed covering, in 33 CE,

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:26.060
Jehovah offered his son as an atoning sacrifice.

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:30.540
Now what moved Jehovah to make that costly sacrifice?

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:34.939
Let's read the answer at 1 John 4, 9.

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:40.180
By this, the love of God was revealed in our case

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:44.300
that God sent his only begotten son into the world

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:48.980
so that we might gain life through him.

00:05:49.019 --> 00:05:51.579
Now, note this important point.

00:05:51.579 --> 00:05:55.259
Jehovah did not only have a feeling of love for us,

00:05:55.259 --> 00:05:58.699
but he revealed his love for us.

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:04.860
In other words, Jehovah provided visible proof of his love for us

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:10.180
by sacrificing his son in our behalf.

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:14.100
Jehovah made the arrangement for that costly sacrifice

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:17.540
so that he was able to reach out to us,

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:22.019
even to people who lived before the time of Christ.

00:06:22.019 --> 00:06:25.220
So to answer our first question,

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:27.699
Jehovah shows his love and compassion

00:06:27.699 --> 00:06:31.819
through the ransom arrangement, because he saves us

00:06:31.819 --> 00:06:36.060
despite the fact that we are sinners.

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:38.899
As the watchtower beautifully stated,

00:06:38.899 --> 00:06:43.139
the ransom was provided not because we are worthy,

00:06:43.139 --> 00:06:46.500
but because we are loved.

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:48.860
Now, our second question.

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:53.540
How does the ransom emphasize why we should show love

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:56.139
to our brothers and sisters?

00:06:56.139 --> 00:06:59.339
Now, let's return to our clock illustration.

00:06:59.339 --> 00:07:03.579
Up to this point, we considered how Jehovah's compassion moved him

00:07:03.579 --> 00:07:07.620
to reach out from 12 to 6 o'clock, so to speak.

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:10.860
Now, we will consider how we can move as it were

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:14.699
from 6 to 12 o'clock.

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:17.060
What happened at 6 o'clock?

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:21.980
Well, to benefit from the ransom, we exercised faith in it.

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:26.980
We dedicated ourselves to Jehovah and God baptized.

00:07:27.339 --> 00:07:30.740
After that, we continue to make spiritual progress

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:32.740
and draw closer to God.

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:35.620
What did we do next?

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:38.740
What else did God require of us?

00:07:39.939 --> 00:07:43.779
Now, remember, Jehovah gave visible proof

00:07:43.819 --> 00:07:48.660
of his love for us by providing the ransom sacrifice.

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:53.660
In turn, Jehovah requires that we also give visible proof

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:56.699
of our love for him.

00:07:56.699 --> 00:07:59.060
And by means of the Apostle John,

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:03.819
Jehovah describes precisely what kind

00:08:03.819 --> 00:08:07.459
of visible proof he expects of us.

00:08:07.459 --> 00:08:12.459
We find the Apostles' instructions at 1 John 4-11.

00:08:12.779 --> 00:08:13.779
Let's read it.

00:08:15.139 --> 00:08:19.740
Beloved ones, if this is how God loved us,

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:24.740
then we are also under obligation to love God in return.

00:08:26.939 --> 00:08:28.579
Is that what John wrote?

00:08:28.579 --> 00:08:32.700
No, although that is what we may have expected.

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:36.620
Instead, John wrote Beloved ones,

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:39.340
if this is how God loved us,

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:44.340
then we are also under obligation to love one another.

00:08:44.899 --> 00:08:47.700
So what is the comparison that John made?

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:51.539
This, Jehovah gave visible proof of his love for us

00:08:51.539 --> 00:08:53.139
by sending his son.

00:08:53.139 --> 00:08:57.340
Now, if this is how God loved us, Rodion,

00:08:57.340 --> 00:08:59.340
how should we respond?

00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:03.259
We give visible proof of our gratitude for the ransom

00:09:03.259 --> 00:09:06.379
by loving one another.

00:09:06.419 --> 00:09:11.220
Now, think for a moment about this amazing statement

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:14.059
of all the visible acts of faith

00:09:14.059 --> 00:09:16.620
that we could have been asked to demonstrate

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:21.059
in order to express our gratitude for the ransom.

00:09:21.059 --> 00:09:24.220
What does Jehovah require of us?

00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:28.940
John stated that we should love our brothers and sisters.

00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:31.460
Clearly, in Jehovah's eyes,

00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:33.860
our showing love to one another

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:37.779
is of the utmost importance.

00:09:37.779 --> 00:09:42.100
So let's return one more time to our clock illustration.

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:45.179
Where do we want to be today?

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:48.860
Now, by showing love for our fellow believers,

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:51.740
we showed Jehovah our gratitude

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:55.580
and we continue to make spiritual progress.

00:09:55.580 --> 00:10:00.580
As a result, we are drawing ever closer to Jehovah

00:10:00.659 --> 00:10:04.620
and to the many blessings he has in store for us.

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:07.740
Eventually, we will enjoy, again,

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:12.059
the precious relationship that Adam and Eve lost.

00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:17.100
In the meantime, today, we are very thankful

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:21.460
to be part of a worldwide family of brothers and sisters

00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:25.700
who give visible proof of their warm love for one another,

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:28.220
especially during this challenging time.

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:33.820
And why will we continue to love one another?

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:35.740
Because by doing so,

00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:38.419
we show our gratitude to Jehovah

00:10:38.419 --> 00:10:40.539
for the ransom arrangement,

00:10:40.539 --> 00:10:44.100
which is the greatest expression of love

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:46.860
and compassion ever shown.
