00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:10.339
When a press runs smoothly, it's a beautiful synchronization of technology.

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:15.339
But to get to that point is an amazing feat.

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:19.960
We were new.

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.960
Most of our crew had never even worked on a press before.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.960
And this was an incredibly complex machine.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.960
It has to be to do what it does.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.549
Each role is spliced automatically.

00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:37.549
The press never stops.

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:40.829
The splice is so fast.

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.829
Everything has to be perfect.

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.829
Or the paper could break.

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:49.829
There can't even be the slightest defect in a role.

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.829
A dent or a nick could stop everything.

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:58.829
We use a special tape that will attach to the previous role.

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:16.930
It hits nerve-wracking.

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.930
Every time a new role starts.

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.069
And you go through that.

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:29.540
It could be 20 times a shift.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.540
But then the press takes over.

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.540
The new role is brought up to speed.

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.540
It's able to track the exact location of the tape

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.540
and connect it to the running paper perfectly.

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:56.739
And that's just to keep the paper flowing.

00:01:56.739 --> 00:02:08.789
Now it has to do the printing.

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.789
The paper passes through four incunence,

00:02:11.789 --> 00:02:14.789
each applying a layer of color.

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:18.789
The result is a full color page.

00:02:18.789 --> 00:02:21.789
At a small scale, what looks like continuous color

00:02:21.789 --> 00:02:24.789
is actually just dots of ink.

00:02:24.789 --> 00:02:29.789
The dots from those four colors have to line up perfectly

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:32.789
within a fraction of a millimeter.

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:35.789
And all of that has to happen while the paper flies through

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:40.520
at 15 meters per second.

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.520
At the top and bottom of an ink unit are cylinders

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.520
with printing plates.

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:50.520
These plates have been made so that when water and ink mix on them,

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.520
the ink is attracted to the image portion

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.520
while the water separates onto the non-image portion.

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.520
The ink on the plates is applied to rubber blankets,

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.520
which act like large stamps that press the ink

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.520
onto both sides of the paper.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.520
In order to get a vibrant and clear finish product,

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.520
there are so many things that have to go exactly right.

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.520
And everything is constantly changing.

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.520
The ink levels, the water levels, the humidity,

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.520
the properties of the paper.

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.520
You're always working to get things just right.

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:33.520
We have to manage all these changes just by varying the water and the ink.

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:44.030
In the end, if you've done your job right, no one should notice.

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:49.030
Once the ink is applied, the publication has to be shaped into its final form.

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:58.629
We have to monitor the fold, the glue, the dryer, the drill rollers, the tension.

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:04.629
The paper is heated and then cooled to set the ink permanently to the page.

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:08.629
It's divided into two ribbons and is aligned.

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:12.629
Then it has to be folded three times.

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:16.629
Each fold has to be perfectly aligned.

00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:20.629
We pull samples regularly to check the quality.

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:25.629
You're always thinking, visualizing things you can't see,

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:29.629
trying to figure out how it affects the finished publication.

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:36.069
The two layers of paper are folded in half on the cone-shaped former board,

00:04:36.069 --> 00:04:40.069
and then cut into individual signatures.

00:04:40.069 --> 00:04:47.069
The signatures then go through large folding cylinders and receive what we call the cross fold.

00:04:47.069 --> 00:04:50.069
They are divided into two lines.

00:04:50.069 --> 00:04:53.069
Both lines receive a final chop fold.

00:04:53.069 --> 00:05:00.069
They're stopped by magnetic breaks and an arm forces them between two rollers.

00:05:00.069 --> 00:05:09.899
And through this whole process, there are over 30 parameters that we adjust to keep everything in alignment.

00:05:09.899 --> 00:05:11.899
You can never let your guard down.

00:05:11.899 --> 00:05:17.899
Different paper, even different rolls can have a big impact on the fold.

00:05:17.899 --> 00:05:20.899
It's like driving a car.

00:05:20.899 --> 00:05:24.899
You're constantly checking your speed, correcting your direction,

00:05:24.899 --> 00:05:27.899
reacting to traffic and road conditions.

00:05:27.899 --> 00:05:47.060
Only you're driving several cars at the same time.

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:53.699
We printed a quarter of a billion magazines last year.

00:05:53.699 --> 00:05:58.699
Every year, every month, the need goes up.
