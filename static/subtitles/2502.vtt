00:00:23.059 --> 00:00:29.440
Do butterflies sound beautiful?

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.839
No, they don't.

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:34.240
Then why did you hope I make them so pretty?

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:41.159
For us, he loves us and wants us to have beauty all around.

00:00:41.159 --> 00:00:48.229
Now think of all the different butterflies you've seen.

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:49.549
Awesome!

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:54.829
Did you know that every single butterfly starts out as a caterpillar?

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:59.560
Look how cute they are.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:13.750
And even before that, the mommy butterfly has to find the right leaf to lay her caterpillar

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:14.750
at it.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.750
Since it's going to be her baby's food.

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.540
Nice!

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:27.140
I can't believe that this turns into this.

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:33.579
Isn't it great that Jehovah designed so many wonderful things for us to discover?

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:36.739
That shows how much he loves us.

00:01:36.739 --> 00:01:42.739
I can't wait to be in paradise to study every butterfly that Jehovah has designed.

00:01:42.739 --> 00:01:51.579
For me, it's so many amazing things.

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:52.579
What's your favorite?
