00:00:01.229 --> 00:00:03.830
Do you like mysteries or puzzles?

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:06.030
What about secrets?

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:10.429
Are you good at keeping honorable secrets confidential?

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:15.929
Jehovah had a secret that he kept for about 4,000 years.

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.429
Unlike human secrets which often are difficult to keep confidential,

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:25.929
Jehovah's sacred secret would be revealed only by divine revelation.

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:31.129
In other words, Jehovah would reveal the details only in his due time.

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:34.429
Proverbs 25 verse 2 says,

00:00:34.429 --> 00:00:39.530
It is the glory of God to keep a matter of secret.

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.329
What's the secret we're talking about?

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.530
It's related to the first prophecy recorded in the Bible,

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.530
found at Genesis chapter 3 verse 15.

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.229
How would Jehovah fix the damage caused by the rebellion in the Garden of Eden?

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:59.630
Jehovah said to the serpent who deceived Eve,

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:05.730
and I will put enmity between you and the woman and between your offspring and her offspring.

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:11.129
He will crush your head and you will strike him in the heel.

00:01:11.129 --> 00:01:13.730
What an intriguing prophecy.

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:17.129
It was spoken some 6,000 years ago,

00:01:17.129 --> 00:01:20.230
but its meaning affects each one of us,

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.629
and every person who has ever lived,

00:01:23.629 --> 00:01:26.329
who was behind the voice of the serpent,

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:28.829
who was the woman.

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.629
Eve might have thought that she was,

00:01:30.629 --> 00:01:32.629
because when she later gave birth to Cain,

00:01:32.629 --> 00:01:35.430
she said at Genesis 4 verse 1,

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.530
I have produced a male child with the help of Jehovah,

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.230
but Eve was not the woman of the prophecy.

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:48.230
Jehovah's secret was still a secret,

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:51.230
who was the offspring of the woman.

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:55.329
If Eve thought it was Cain, she was sadly disappointed.

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:59.629
Jehovah would reveal these details according to his timetable,

00:01:59.629 --> 00:02:03.329
long after Adam and Eve died.

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:09.129
We might compare the revealing of Jehovah's sacred secret to this puzzle box.

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:13.330
It's locked and seems impossible to open.

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.430
However, a series of steps leads to opening the box

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.530
and revealing the treasure inside.

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:25.430
Those steps are like the details that led to identifying

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.830
the promised offspring of the woman.

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.030
What were some of those details?

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.430
Over 2,000 years after the prophecy in Eden,

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.330
Jehovah made a promise to the faithful man Abraham

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.229
that provided a piece of the puzzle.

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:45.129
What did Jehovah say?

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:50.129
We find his words at Genesis 22 verses 17 and 18.

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:52.330
I will surely bless you,

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.629
and I will surely multiply your offspring

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:59.629
like the stars of the heavens and like the grains of sand on the seashore,

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:04.229
and your offspring will take possession of the gate of his enemies.

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:06.530
And by means of your offspring,

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.030
all nations of the earth will obtain a blessing for themselves.

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:12.629
Wow.

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:20.389
Jehovah revealed the first detail to unlock his sacred secret.

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:23.590
Abraham must have been amazed when he looked up to the heavens

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.289
and saw thousands of stars.

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:31.090
Although Abraham would not see the complete fulfillment of the promise

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:32.990
in his lifetime,

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:35.990
it certainly would be fulfilled at a future time

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:39.289
by the God who does not lie.

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:43.689
Jehovah repeated the promise to Abraham's son Isaac

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:46.490
and to Isaac's son Jacob.

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.590
Jacob in his deathbed prophecy said at Genesis 4910

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:55.689
that the scepter would not depart from Judah.

00:03:55.689 --> 00:03:58.689
So we learned that kingship is involved

00:03:58.689 --> 00:04:03.490
and that the promised offspring would come through Judah's line.

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:09.389
Later, Jehovah provided the mosaic law to help protect the nation of Israel

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:12.789
and the promised offspring.

00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:17.689
What was the next significant detail to be revealed?

00:04:17.689 --> 00:04:24.889
In 1070 BCE, Judah's descendant David became king over all Israel.

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:28.589
David was a man agreeable to Jehovah's heart

00:04:28.589 --> 00:04:32.290
and Jehovah promised to raise up someone in David's royal line

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:34.389
who would rule forever.

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:41.089
The promise is recorded at 2 Samuel 7 verses 12 and 13.

00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:44.790
I will raise up your offspring after you, your own son,

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:48.389
and I will firmly establish his kingdom.

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:53.490
I will firmly establish the throne of his kingdom forever

00:04:53.490 --> 00:05:03.050
where one step closer to identifying the promised offspring.

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.850
The offspring would come through David's line.

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:09.550
Although David's son Solomon had a peaceful reign,

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:13.250
he was not the king who would rule forever.

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:18.149
That king would appear in the future at Jehovah's appointed time.

00:05:18.149 --> 00:05:22.649
Of course, the devil didn't want the promised offspring of the woman to appear.

00:05:22.649 --> 00:05:29.050
So he repeatedly tried to eliminate or contaminate the lineage to the offspring.

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:35.569
However, Jehovah made sure that the devil failed in his attempts.

00:05:35.569 --> 00:05:38.569
Down through the centuries, Jehovah through his prophets

00:05:38.569 --> 00:05:42.870
provided specific details regarding the promised offspring.

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:48.870
For instance, the prophet Micah foretold that the Messiah would be born in Bethlehem.

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:53.970
Daniel's prophecy of the 70 weeks of years indicated the exact year

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:56.569
when the Messiah would appear.

00:05:56.569 --> 00:06:02.769
Also Isaiah's prophecy revealed that the offspring would die a sacrificial death.

00:06:02.769 --> 00:06:09.670
Jehovah was progressively revealing details about his sacred secret.

00:06:09.769 --> 00:06:13.069
Centuries later, in the year 2 BCE,

00:06:13.069 --> 00:06:16.569
the angel Gabriel appeared to a Jewish virgin named Mary

00:06:16.569 --> 00:06:19.769
and made a startling declaration to her.

00:06:19.769 --> 00:06:21.569
Would you like to know what it is?

00:06:21.569 --> 00:06:26.970
It's found at Luke 1 verses 31 through 33.

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:32.170
Look, you will become pregnant and give birth to a son

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:35.370
and you are to name him Jesus.

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:40.569
This one will be great and will be called son of the most high.

00:06:40.569 --> 00:06:45.569
And Jehovah God will give him the throne of David, his father.

00:06:45.569 --> 00:06:49.970
And he will rule as king over the house of Jacob forever.

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:54.170
And there will be no end to his kingdom.

00:06:54.170 --> 00:07:00.670
Both Mary and Jesus' adoptive father, Joseph, were descendants of David.

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:07.670
So Jesus received both the natural and the legal rights of an heir of David.

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:11.170
Can you imagine what might have been going through Mary's mind

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:13.970
after hearing those words?

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:17.870
Did she perhaps remember hearing similar details from the book of Moses

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:20.670
about the promised offspring?

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:25.670
Of course, about nine months later, when Jesus was born,

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:30.569
Jehovah's angel appeared to shepherds who were tending their flocks near Bethlehem.

00:07:30.569 --> 00:07:34.470
The angel announced, as recorded in Luke chapter 2,

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:40.569
today there was born to you in David's city, a savior, who was Christ the Lord.

00:07:40.569 --> 00:07:44.670
After thousands of years, Jehovah was giving notice

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:48.870
that his sacred secret would soon be revealed.

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:53.870
The shepherds went and told Mary and Joseph about this divine message.

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:57.569
The word about the Christ was spreading.

00:07:57.569 --> 00:08:01.269
About 30 years later, in the days of John the baptizer,

00:08:01.269 --> 00:08:03.670
the people were in expectation.

00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:07.069
And all of them were reasoning in their hearts about John.

00:08:07.069 --> 00:08:10.569
May he perhaps be the Christ?

00:08:10.569 --> 00:08:16.370
A short time later, Jesus the Nazarene came to John to be baptized.

00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:18.970
After Jesus came up out of the water,

00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:22.170
Jehovah anointed him with holy spirit and said,

00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:25.970
this is my son, the beloved.

00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:46.120
At long last, the promised offspring of Genesis 315 had arrived.

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:51.120
Humble Jews readily responded to Jesus' teachings in ministry,

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:56.220
but there were many more details about the sacred secret yet to be revealed,

00:08:56.220 --> 00:09:04.909
like the many facets of a beautiful crystal.

00:09:04.909 --> 00:09:11.009
During his ministry, Jesus himself identified the serpent as Satan,

00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:17.110
and the serpent's offspring as those who display the devil's characteristics.

00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:22.710
Jesus also revealed, as recorded in Luke 22 verses 28 through 30,

00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:26.509
that there would be a secondary part of the woman's offspring.

00:09:26.509 --> 00:09:31.809
Spirit anointed Christians who will rule with Christ in heaven.

00:09:31.809 --> 00:09:36.009
Later, the Apostle Paul identified the woman of the prophecy

00:09:36.009 --> 00:09:38.909
as the heavenly part of Jehovah's organization

00:09:38.909 --> 00:09:42.909
made up of faithful spirit creatures.

00:09:42.909 --> 00:09:49.610
Of course, the enmity foretold at Genesis 3 verse 15 continues into our day.

00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:53.509
The devil and his offspring continued to wage war with the remaining ones

00:09:53.509 --> 00:09:57.009
of the woman's offspring on earth.

00:09:57.009 --> 00:10:02.210
But what did the Messiah accomplish while he was on the earth?

00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:06.610
The Jews were hoping that he would bring liberation from Roman oppression.

00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:10.909
However, Daniel's prophecy indicated that the Messiah would be cut off

00:10:10.909 --> 00:10:12.509
or put to death.

00:10:12.509 --> 00:10:19.210
This corresponded to the striking in the heel mentioned at Genesis 3 verse 15.

00:10:19.210 --> 00:10:23.210
Still, Jehovah also revealed at Psalm 16 verse 10

00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:27.009
that his son would not be left in the grave.

00:10:27.009 --> 00:10:33.909
True to his promise, Jehovah resurrected Jesus less than three days after his death.

00:10:34.009 --> 00:10:37.509
Of course, a principal part of Jehovah's sacred secret

00:10:37.509 --> 00:10:42.610
involved the Messianic kingdom of which Christ would be king.

00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:46.309
While Jesus was on earth, he cured the sick.

00:10:46.309 --> 00:10:49.809
He fed the hungry and resurrected the dead,

00:10:49.809 --> 00:10:55.809
things that will do on a far greater scale as king of God's kingdom.

00:10:55.809 --> 00:10:59.509
After Jesus ascended to heaven, many additional details

00:10:59.509 --> 00:11:02.509
about God's sacred secret were revealed in the writings

00:11:02.509 --> 00:11:06.110
we now know as the Christian Greek scriptures.

00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:08.509
Colossians 2 verse 3 says,

00:11:08.509 --> 00:11:15.809
carefully concealed in him or Christ are all the treasures of wisdom and of knowledge.

00:11:15.809 --> 00:11:20.210
When did the sacred secret come to its finish?

00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:24.809
Revelation 10 verse 7 says that it would occur in the days when the seventh angel

00:11:24.809 --> 00:11:27.809
is about to blow his trumpet.

00:11:27.809 --> 00:11:29.710
When did that take place?

00:11:29.809 --> 00:11:34.509
Let's note the answer at Revelation 11 verse 15.

00:11:34.509 --> 00:11:37.309
The seventh angel blew his trumpet

00:11:37.309 --> 00:11:40.610
and there were loud voices in heaven saying,

00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:44.809
the kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ

00:11:44.809 --> 00:11:48.710
and he will rule as king forever and ever.

00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:56.210
This occurred in 1914 when Christ Jesus became king of God's kingdom.

00:11:56.210 --> 00:11:58.610
But is that the end?

00:11:58.610 --> 00:12:00.110
No.

00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:06.110
The Revelation provides additional details regarding God's kingdom and future events

00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:09.809
that most people would consider shocking.

00:12:09.809 --> 00:12:13.710
For example, Revelation 19 verses 11 through 16

00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:17.710
reveals that Christ Jesus, the king of kings and Lord of lords,

00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:23.909
will strike the nations and shepherd them with a rod of iron.

00:12:23.909 --> 00:12:29.009
As king of God's kingdom, Jesus will soon crush all human governments

00:12:29.009 --> 00:12:33.309
and hurl the devil into an abyss of inactivity.

00:12:33.309 --> 00:12:39.009
This will lead to 1,000 years of peace.

00:12:39.009 --> 00:12:41.309
At the end of the thousand years,

00:12:41.309 --> 00:12:45.409
the devil will be released from the abyss for a short time.

00:12:45.409 --> 00:12:50.409
And then the final fulfillment of Genesis 3 verse 15 will occur.

00:12:50.509 --> 00:12:57.100
The offspring of the woman will crush the head of the devil.

00:12:57.100 --> 00:13:01.279
How does all of this affect us?

00:13:01.279 --> 00:13:04.480
We're privileged to know about God's sacred secret,

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:09.480
which he kept secret for some 4,000 years.

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:15.179
Some of the details Jehovah has helped his people to understand only in recent decades.

00:13:15.179 --> 00:13:22.389
Yes, Jehovah has made known to us the sacred secret of his will.

00:13:22.389 --> 00:13:28.690
During this broadcast, we have considered only a few facets of God's sacred secret.

00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:33.389
Why not make it a project for personal or family worship?

00:13:33.389 --> 00:13:36.690
It's thrilling to think about kingdom realities

00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:41.889
and how Jehovah will completely undo the effects of Satan's rebellion.

00:13:41.889 --> 00:13:45.190
Christ Jesus now rules as king in the heavens

00:13:45.190 --> 00:13:50.889
and the days for this evil system of things under Satan's domination are numbered.

00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:54.789
Jesus will soon strike the nations with the rod of iron

00:13:54.789 --> 00:14:00.500
and then transform the earth into a beautiful paradise.

00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:04.500
What does Jehovah want us to do with his sacred secret?

00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:07.899
Should we put it back into the box?

00:14:07.899 --> 00:14:10.399
Buried in the ground?

00:14:10.399 --> 00:14:14.899
No, Jehovah wants us to make it known.

00:14:14.899 --> 00:14:19.799
The sacred secret is now being proclaimed in over 1,000 languages.

00:14:19.899 --> 00:14:23.200
Are you having a full share?

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:26.100
Deep appreciation for this sacred secret

00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:32.899
and all that it means for the future will impell us to share it with as many people as possible.

00:14:32.899 --> 00:14:36.299
When the Apostle Paul wrote to Christians in Ephesus,

00:14:36.299 --> 00:14:41.700
he requested of them as recorded at Ephesians 6 verse 19.

00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:44.100
Pray also for me

00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:47.700
that the words may be given to me when I open my mouth

00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:54.700
so that I may be able to speak boldly and making known the sacred secret of the good news.

00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:58.500
That's our prayer for you, dear brothers and sisters,

00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:04.000
that we all may continue to declare Jehovah's sacred secret with boldness.
