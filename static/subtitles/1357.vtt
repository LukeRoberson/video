00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:10.730
I could say that my past was really an unhappy past.

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:15.730
I went through very difficult times during my childhood.

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:21.730
I lost hope that I could ever have a better life.

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.730
Because of that, I started to associate with the wrong people in my life.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:33.229
One night I was arrested and sent a Boulot prison.

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:36.229
It is a high security prison in Congo.

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:44.829
Prison is a very dangerous place,

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:47.829
but I was surprised how they accepted the truce easily.

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:50.829
Really, I was amazed.

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:55.829
We needed to obtain permission to be able to continue to preach in the prison.

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.829
We had so enjoyed the preaching work there.

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:06.269
I went to see the authorities in the city to find out what was required

00:01:06.269 --> 00:01:09.269
so that we could have permission to preach in the prison.

00:01:09.269 --> 00:01:15.269
To my great amazement, they simply handed me a paper

00:01:15.269 --> 00:01:18.269
and told me to put my request in writing.

00:01:18.269 --> 00:01:20.269
They asked me to wait.

00:01:20.269 --> 00:01:26.269
Within minutes, I had the authorization in my hands without paying anything at all.

00:01:26.269 --> 00:01:32.269
Every time the situation seemed insurmountable to us, impossible to us,

00:01:32.269 --> 00:01:37.269
we saw the hand of Jehovah providing us with the suitable solution.

00:01:40.739 --> 00:01:45.739
The authorization gave a great boost to the special witnessing initiative.

00:01:45.739 --> 00:01:49.739
In harmony with 1 Corinthians 9 verses 22 and 23,

00:01:49.739 --> 00:01:54.739
the brothers could then become all things to people of all sorts,

00:01:54.739 --> 00:01:59.739
so that they might by all possible means save some.

00:01:59.739 --> 00:02:02.739
Some religious leaders, who were also prisoners,

00:02:02.739 --> 00:02:05.739
were extremely opposed to our presence.

00:02:06.739 --> 00:02:11.740
They conspired and had us thrown out of our meeting place.

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.740
The prisoners themselves were concerned about this.

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.740
They found another meeting place even more spacious than the former.

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:30.550
Since Boulevard is 8 kilometers away from our congregation,

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.550
to transport the group who support the preaching organ meetings,

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.550
the body of elders organized too many buses to go out every Saturday to Boulevard.

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:45.550
Once they arrived, they began the preaching work at 8.30

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.550
and at 10 o'clock the meetings start.

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:53.780
All the meetings of the week are held on the Saturday.

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.780
Concerning Jehovah's Witnesses personally, I'm very impressed.

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.780
It's more than three years they've been more active in helping the detainees.

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.780
The re-education of the prisoners is assured by Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.780
This is a good collaboration on the part of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:21.430
With this, I'm very happy.

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.430
175 attended the Circuit Assembly in December 2014,

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:30.430
which was held in the prison, and seven were baptized.

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:36.819
Local media covered the event.

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:41.819
This is the first time I've seen Jehovah's Witnesses baptized here in the Boulevard prison.

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:43.819
This is a good thing.

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:47.819
I encourage you to continue with this assistance.

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:53.819
Every week there are more than 18 attendants, and sometimes more than that, even 140.

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:56.819
In the attendance, there are the 36 publishers,

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:59.819
the brothers who learned the truth in Boulevard prison,

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:02.819
30 are baptized and 6 are baptized.

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.650
I visited many churches because I had a lot of questions,

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.650
but I never got any exact answers.

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.649
When I went to see Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:04:19.649 --> 00:04:23.649
they gave me accurate answers from the Bible.

00:04:23.649 --> 00:04:27.649
To know that Jehovah is compassionate and ready to forgive,

00:04:27.649 --> 00:04:33.470
these are the qualities that touch me.

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:37.470
I used to be a soldier. I was in the military.

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:42.470
I attended various churches because I had a question that bothered me a lot.

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:49.470
I wondered why God allows bad things to happen to people all the time.

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.470
While I was in prison,

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:58.470
Jehovah's Witnesses came to visit and talk to us.

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.470
I asked them the same question,

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:06.470
why does God allow sickness and suffering to continue?

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:10.470
They replied by using three Bible verses.

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:16.470
I was very happy because I received the answer to my question.

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:24.610
Papiokito is the brother who learned the truth in prison.

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.610
He made such remarkable progress

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:31.610
that those in charge now have confidence in him.

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:35.610
Like Joseph in the Bible,

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:39.610
he has been placed in a position of supervision over the other prisoners.

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:41.610
He also made further progress,

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:47.610
and thus the management has requested that his prison sentence be reduced.

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:52.610
When I arrived in the prison, I had lost hope.

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:54.610
I thought for me it was the end.

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:59.610
By means of the Bible, I have found joy and hope in my life.

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:02.610
That is why today I am happy,

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:04.610
even though I am still here,

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:07.610
but I know that the paradise is for me.

00:06:24.029 --> 00:06:28.029
It's been five years since the brothers started preaching in the Bulu prison.

00:06:28.029 --> 00:06:33.029
At times, the publishers placed up to 500 magazines in one weekend.

00:06:33.029 --> 00:06:37.029
Although our success is not measured by the number of placements,

00:06:37.029 --> 00:06:42.029
this response does paint a clear picture of the spiritual thirst among these prisoners.

00:06:42.029 --> 00:06:44.029
In the last few months,

00:06:44.029 --> 00:06:46.029
inside these prison walls,

00:06:46.029 --> 00:06:49.029
11 more unbaptized publishers have been approved.

00:06:50.029 --> 00:06:52.029
What a loving act by Jehovah

00:06:52.029 --> 00:06:58.029
and his organization to help such individual satisfy their spiritual needs.
