00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:10.160
basic Bible teachings are wonderful. Usually it's the fundamental doctrines of the Bible,

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:17.600
basic teachings that draw people to the truth. However, learning basic Bible teachings

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.519
is just the beginning of knowledge about Jehovah.

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:30.440
At Hebrews chapter 6 and verse 1, the Apostle Paul exhorts all students of God's word to

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:40.679
progress beyond basic teachings. This is what is stated at Hebrews 6-1. Therefore, now that we

00:00:40.679 --> 00:00:49.399
have moved beyond the primary doctrine about the Christ, let us press on to maturity. Isn't that

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:55.880
what we want to achieve with our Bible students to help them move beyond the primary doctrine and

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:04.359
progress to Christian maturity? It comes about in degrees as students acquire an increased level

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:15.480
of knowledge and appreciation for the truth. Bible students must learn to love God and his standards

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:22.920
and appreciate that all of his ways and requirements are expressions of his love for us.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:31.079
When Bible students experience the good that comes from obeying Jehovah and following his ways,

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.719
their love for him will deepen. As you watch the following video,

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:44.439
please note how a sister helps her student to make progress toward maturity.

00:01:47.349 --> 00:01:52.230
Mrs. C. Water was doing great. We were already on lesson 10.

00:01:53.510 --> 00:02:02.219
I really hope she comes to a meeting soon. We talked about Hebrews 10, 24, and 25,

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:24.219
and watched the video. Did I miss something? I guess I did. I was too focused on our progress with

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:38.659
the lessons. Instead of her progress and what she needed, Mr. C. Water said, going to meetings with

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:48.419
dishonor the family. He wanted her to quit the study. She didn't want to quit, but whenever she

00:02:48.419 --> 00:02:53.860
tried to talk about it, they argued. We showed her where to look for help.

00:02:54.819 --> 00:03:24.300
And may time during our studies to talk about it more, we all pray for Jehovah to bless her

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:42.409
efforts. We did our best to share the good news of peace, and Jehovah did the rest.

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:55.939
As we saw, the student took an important step toward Christian maturity when she began to attend

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:04.819
meetings. As you study with your student lesson 7 to 11 of the Enjoy Life Forever book,

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:12.979
please be sure to highlight Jehovah's appealing qualities that are set forth in those lessons.

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:21.220
For example, lesson 7 of the Enjoy Life Forever book describes Jehovah's loving ways.

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:29.699
We want to help our students to understand that Jehovah really does love them as individuals,

00:04:30.339 --> 00:04:38.339
and wants them to achieve everlasting life. The Apostle John highlights Jehovah's love at

00:04:38.339 --> 00:04:45.860
1 John 4.9 by pointing out that Jehovah sent Jesus to earth to take our place in death,

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:53.459
and thus pay for our inherited sins and our personal sins. Yes, out of love,

00:04:53.459 --> 00:05:02.500
Jehovah provided a way for us to enjoy an approved standing with him. This is one of Jehovah's

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:11.699
loving ways. Lesson 8 shows us how to become Jehovah's Friend. This is likely something that most

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:18.740
people have never even thought of. Can you imagine the privilege of becoming God's Friend?

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:26.420
Help your students to see how their obedience and exclusive devotion to Jehovah

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:36.819
pave the way to friendship with him. Proverbs chapter 3 verses 5 and 6 tells us specifically

00:05:36.899 --> 00:05:43.779
what Jehovah wants us to do. Proverbs chapter 3 verses 5 and 6 says,

00:05:46.339 --> 00:05:54.660
trust in Jehovah with all your heart, and do not rely on your own understanding.

00:05:55.699 --> 00:06:02.100
In all your ways, take notice of him, and he will make your path straight.

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:12.339
We show our trust in Jehovah by doing what he tells us to do, and thereby we become his friends.

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:19.060
Jehovah takes good care of his friends, and he is always loyal to them.

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:30.180
Lesson 9 highlights the power of prayer. Teach your Bible students how to pray to Jehovah.

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:37.860
In addition to prayer, regular Bible reading is also necessary to make spiritual progress.

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:48.420
Psalm, the first Psalm, verses 2 and 3, encourages Bible reading. Let's look it up together.

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:55.860
That's Psalm, the first Psalm, and we're going to read verses 2 and 3.

00:06:56.259 --> 00:07:02.100
It's speaking about a man of God who takes delight in God's word. It says,

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:08.660
but his delight is in the law of Jehovah, where the law of Jehovah is found in the Bible,

00:07:09.379 --> 00:07:17.860
and it says, and he reads his law in an undertone day and night. He will be like a tree planted

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:24.579
by streams of water, a tree that produces fruit in its season, the foliage of which does not

00:07:24.579 --> 00:07:31.459
wither, and everything he does will succeed. Yes, everything he does as a Christian,

00:07:31.459 --> 00:07:40.019
leading a Christian life will succeed. Reading God's word and then putting it into practice brings

00:07:40.019 --> 00:07:46.899
Jehovah's blessing. Now, if you have a student who feels limited in his learning ability,

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:56.740
perhaps due to a lack of education, please encourage him to go to Jehovah in prayer and persist

00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:05.379
in asking him for help to understand his word. James chapter 1 and verse 5 assures us that

00:08:05.379 --> 00:08:15.589
Jehovah is ready and willing to help those who keep on asking him for help. Lesson 10 gives this

00:08:15.589 --> 00:08:22.550
direction. As soon as possible, invite Bible students to attend congregation meetings.

00:08:23.589 --> 00:08:31.269
What your student hears and observes at Christian meetings can touch his heart and will help him to

00:08:31.269 --> 00:08:39.269
progress. So when you show your student the video, what happens at a kingdom hall, that would be

00:08:39.429 --> 00:08:47.990
a good time to warmly invite him to attend meetings. Also, be sure to invite a variety of

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:53.429
publishers to accompany you on the study. In that way, your student will get acquainted with

00:08:53.429 --> 00:08:59.350
others in the congregation, and he will likely feel more at home when he attends our meetings.

00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:08.389
Lesson 11. In this lesson, we are encouraged to teach our students how to do

00:09:08.389 --> 00:09:17.990
personal study using JW.org and JW Library. Show your student how to use these tools.

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:25.429
If you feel a bit unsure about teaching someone to make use of their electronic device for research,

00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:34.309
don't hesitate to ask for help from the congregation. There are many who will be delighted to assist you.

00:09:35.269 --> 00:09:43.750
The blessings that we receive when we teach someone the truth is described by the Apostle John

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:51.990
at 3 John, verse 4, where it states, no greater joy do I have than this, that I should hear that

00:09:51.990 --> 00:10:00.149
my children go on walking in the truth. Yes, John is speaking of his spiritual children.

00:10:00.389 --> 00:10:08.789
That same joy can be ours. What has this symposium brought to our attention?

00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:14.230
It has helped us to see how we can maintain our zeal for the preaching work.

00:10:15.429 --> 00:10:20.309
It has instructed us to prepare well to share the truth with others.

00:10:21.429 --> 00:10:25.990
It showed us how to take the initiative to give an informal witness,

00:10:26.629 --> 00:10:32.710
to follow up on interest, and to help Bible students grow to maturity.

00:10:34.309 --> 00:10:39.269
If we do the best we can in the ministry, whether people respond or not,

00:10:40.309 --> 00:10:46.470
we will enjoy the peace that comes from knowing that we are pleasing Jehovah.

00:10:47.669 --> 00:10:55.429
Hebrews 13, 15 and 16, tells us how to bring pleasure to Jehovah God,

00:10:55.429 --> 00:11:03.110
and that's certainly something we want to do. That's Hebrews 13, 15 and 16. It reads,

00:11:06.649 --> 00:11:14.330
through Him, that is through Jesus, let us always offer to God a sacrifice of praise,

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:20.169
that is the fruit of our lips, that make public declaration to His name.

00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:26.409
Moreover, do not forget to do good and to share what you have with others,

00:11:27.049 --> 00:11:35.929
for God is well pleased with such sacrifices. Your readiness to share the good news of peace with

00:11:35.929 --> 00:11:45.529
others is just such a sacrifice, and you can rest assured that Jehovah is thoroughly pleased

00:11:45.529 --> 00:11:54.169
with your loving and faithful service to Him.
