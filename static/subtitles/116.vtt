00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:05.259
Welcome to JW Broadcasting.

00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:12.259
In this month's program, we'll learn how to develop and protect our God-given thinking ability.

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:15.259
Here are some highlights of what's to come.

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:21.260
In our next episode of Immitate Their Faith, we'll learn from Rebecca.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.260
How did her love for God influence her choices?

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.260
A priest spent years lost an amaze of confusing teachings.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.259
How did she escape the maze and find truth?

00:00:34.259 --> 00:00:41.259
If you've been feeling like life is non-stop, you'll enjoy our latest music video.

00:00:41.259 --> 00:00:47.259
It's a reminder to take a breath, pause and reset.

00:00:47.259 --> 00:00:52.259
This is JW Broadcasting for July 2024.

00:00:52.259 --> 00:01:17.260
Younger old, we need to consider the topic of thinking ability

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.260
and how to develop it effectively.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:26.260
All of us can think. We can think about a lot of things.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.260
Some good and some bad.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:35.260
It's not uncommon, even for an adult, to let his mind wander aimlessly.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:41.260
Or a person may spend time thinking of frivolous matters of little substance.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.260
That's what can happen to our thinking.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:51.260
But it doesn't always have a positive effect on our life or our future.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.260
Those specifically address to a young man.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:02:00.260
The Bible book of Proverbs gives sound advice for all of us.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.260
Proverbs chapter 1 verse 4 says,

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:11.259
To give a young man, for that matter any of us, knowledge and thinking ability.

00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:14.259
What is thinking ability in this verse?

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:22.259
The Hebrew word translated thinking ability can be used in a bad sense or in a favorable one.

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:30.259
So our mind and thoughts can be directed to a worthy, upright end or just the opposite.

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:35.259
If we incline our thinking to aspects of Jehovah's will and purposes,

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:39.259
we'll safeguard our own thinking ability,

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:43.259
directing it into the right channels.

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:47.259
How valuable is that type of thinking process?

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:51.259
Turn to Proverbs chapter 3 verses 21 and 22,

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:52.259
which states,

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:57.259
safeguard practical wisdom and thinking ability.

00:02:57.259 --> 00:03:00.259
They will give you life.

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:05.259
Thinking ability is not in the exclusive realm of the studious type.

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:15.259
Throughout our entire life, we take in information by reading, seeing, hearing and experiencing things.

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:24.259
And it's the way we take in information and react to it that shapes our individual behavior and personality.

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:31.259
Many persons have not used their minds for much more than the essentials of daily living.

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:35.259
But to succeed in life and in Jehovah's eyes,

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:42.259
it's necessary that we learn to train, develop and guard thinking ability.

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:51.259
Consider how trained thinking ability might protect us when it comes to using the Internet wisely.

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:55.259
While the Internet can be an excellent tool for gathering knowledge,

00:03:55.259 --> 00:04:02.259
thinking ability when properly exercised will safeguard us from its harmful effects.

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:04.259
For example,

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:14.259
some popular social media sites contain short videos designed to deliver instant gratification.

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:18.259
If the viewer gets no immediate emotional reward,

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:25.259
he is tempted to keep scrolling to find material that will give the desired effect.

00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:29.259
Now over time, this can lure one's attention span,

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:37.259
which may impede a person's ability to learn, retain and recall information.

00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:43.259
None of us would want that to happen to us, would we?

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:49.259
Additionally, studies have shown that those who spend too much of their time with their electronic devices

00:04:49.259 --> 00:04:57.259
are more prone to stress, anxiety, depression or other mental health problems.

00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:06.259
On the other hand, thinking ability can help us to work out ways to control our use of such technology.

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:18.259
For example, God oriented thinking ability can help us to distinguish truth from misleading and false information.

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:25.259
Thus there is wisdom in what is stated in Proverbs chapter 2 verses 11 and 12.

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:30.259
Thinking ability will keep watch over you,

00:05:30.259 --> 00:05:37.259
and discernment will safeguard you to save you from the bad course.

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:41.259
Why is this so important?

00:05:41.259 --> 00:05:47.259
Well, thinking ability and discernment gives us perception,

00:05:47.259 --> 00:05:52.259
and perception is closely related to our conscience.

00:05:53.259 --> 00:05:59.259
What we have meditated on from God's Word and stored in our mind can mold our conscience,

00:05:59.259 --> 00:06:06.259
which is an inner mechanism to warn us of wrong actions or tendencies.

00:06:06.259 --> 00:06:11.259
In effect, our thinking watches over us.

00:06:11.259 --> 00:06:17.259
Now notice how this is alluded to at Hebrews chapter 5 and verse 14.

00:06:17.259 --> 00:06:24.259
But solid food belongs to mature people, to those who through use have their powers of discernment

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:30.259
that is their thinking, trained to distinguish both right and wrong.

00:06:30.259 --> 00:06:38.259
All of us, both young and old, should think carefully about the following suggestions.

00:06:38.259 --> 00:06:43.259
Firstly, grow in knowledge of Jehovah.

00:06:44.259 --> 00:06:47.259
Proverbs 9 verse 10 says in part,

00:06:47.259 --> 00:06:52.259
knowledge of the most holy one is understanding.

00:06:52.259 --> 00:06:58.259
Coming to know Jehovah is a blessing and a protection.

00:06:58.259 --> 00:07:02.259
We need to pray to Jehovah for insight when we study,

00:07:02.259 --> 00:07:09.259
apply ourselves to Bible reading on a regular basis and immerse ourselves in the truth.

00:07:09.259 --> 00:07:14.259
We should talk to Jehovah in prayer as our closest confident.

00:07:14.259 --> 00:07:23.259
This means using our thinking ability to convince ourselves that Jehovah's advice is the best advice.

00:07:23.259 --> 00:07:28.259
Because doing so will safeguard us when we're tempted, tested,

00:07:28.259 --> 00:07:34.259
or put into a situation where we know we must say no.

00:07:35.259 --> 00:07:43.579
Remember who we are, what we stand for, and to whom we have dedicated our life.

00:07:43.579 --> 00:07:50.579
Next suggestion, we need to continue to enhance our Christian personality.

00:07:50.579 --> 00:07:53.579
This is important, but why?

00:07:53.579 --> 00:08:00.579
Because people who love Jehovah will like and respect us for who we are.

00:08:00.579 --> 00:08:04.579
And what kind of personality are we suggesting?

00:08:04.579 --> 00:08:08.579
Did you note the expression Christian personality?

00:08:08.579 --> 00:08:11.579
That means Christ-like.

00:08:11.579 --> 00:08:17.579
We cannot go wrong by imitating Jesus in any way possible.

00:08:17.579 --> 00:08:22.579
Recall that 1 Peter 2 verse 21 says,

00:08:22.579 --> 00:08:27.579
to this course you were called because even Christ suffered for you,

00:08:27.579 --> 00:08:33.580
leaving a model for you to follow his steps closely.

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:40.580
Jesus' whole way of life, his attitudes, his values, his interactions with others,

00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:47.580
culminated into a personality that we should strive to follow closely.

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:52.580
We know well how we want to look when dressed for a special occasion.

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:57.580
We cloth ourselves with careful attention to details.

00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:02.580
Colossians 3 verse 10 picks up on the illustration of clothing.

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:05.580
There it states,

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:10.580
and cloth yourselves with the new personality.

00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:15.580
Similarly, Romans 13 verse 14 tells us,

00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:18.580
put on the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:23.580
and do not be planning ahead for the desires of the flesh.

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:27.580
We have to think about Jesus' personality constantly.

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:33.580
It certainly does not come naturally to us in perfect descendants of Adam.

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:36.580
It takes real thinking ability.

00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:43.580
And remember, in this case, we are not clothing ourselves just for one special occasion.

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:46.580
This is to be our daily wardrobe.

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:50.580
To the extent possible, with our imperfection,

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:55.580
we continuously work to reflect Jesus' personality.

00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:58.980
Next suggestion.

00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:02.980
Give priority to our priorities.

00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:04.980
What does this mean?

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:11.980
To accomplish things in life, we must have schedules, routines, and priorities.

00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:17.980
For instance, at Bethel, much work is accomplished because of the daily routine

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:22.980
and because of giving priority to spiritual matters.

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:25.980
At Philippians 1 verse 10, Paul said,

00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:30.980
to make sure of the more important things.

00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:34.980
Paul's some thinking ability will help us to see the value

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:42.980
of organizing our life each day to give priority to the most important things.

00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:44.980
Next suggestion.

00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:49.980
Keep a modest view of our own knowledge and experience.

00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:55.980
Thinking ability will help us to filter the information we let into our mind.

00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:59.980
The real test of whether our thinking ability has been properly trained

00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:02.980
is how we apply knowledge.

00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:05.980
So we need to be cautious in life.

00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:14.980
Ask questions, fact check, get advice, read, study, and learn from Bible principles.

00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:19.980
And once we've accumulated knowledge, insight, and thinking ability,

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:24.980
modesty is involved in how we share it.

00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:28.980
The Apostle Paul said at Romans 12 verse 3,

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:36.980
I tell everyone there among you not to think more of himself than it is necessary to think,

00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:40.980
but to think so as to have a sound mind.

00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:46.980
Yes, we need to display a modest outlook on our acquired thinking ability.

00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:51.980
Did you notice it said to think with a sound mind?

00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:59.980
Not an inflated mind, not thinking more of ourselves than is necessary to think.

00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:04.980
Another way to use thinking ability in this old world is to avoid debt.

00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:07.980
Now why is this our last point?

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:12.980
Because material things are not the most important things in life.

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:17.980
Many work themselves to death to gain material prosperity.

00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:22.980
However, as Christians, there's other work that's related to worship.

00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:25.980
We want to work ourselves to life.

00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:30.980
Yes, focused on everlasting life, yet ahead.

00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:36.980
It's true though that some money is needed to buy the necessities of life.

00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:41.980
Whether we're young and just starting to earn a living or we're older

00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:49.980
and have been working secularly for years, we need to learn to manage and budget money.

00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:56.980
This involves using our thinking ability to separate needs from once

00:12:56.980 --> 00:13:01.980
and being cautious about accumulating much debt.

00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:10.980
Remember, according to Proverbs 22 verse 7, the borrower is a slave to the lender.

00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:19.980
These few suggestions are but a sample of areas in life where we need thinking ability and discernment

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:26.980
in order to analyze our situation, make decisions and determine future plans.

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:32.980
Always remember the advice of Proverbs 3, 21 and 22,

00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:37.980
safeguard practical wisdom and thinking ability.

00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:39.980
They will give you life.

00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:47.870
Yes, and we may add, even everlasting life in God's righteous new world.

00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:52.870
Young people in the Bible used our thinking ability to make wise decisions.

00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:55.870
Rebecca was one of them.

00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:59.870
Let's see how she was able to make a life-changing choice.

00:13:59.870 --> 00:14:12.639
Long ago, Abraham sent his servant Ellie Ezer to find a wife for his son Isaac.

00:14:12.639 --> 00:14:16.639
He knew God's purpose required a woman of deep faith.

00:14:16.639 --> 00:14:21.639
But who would be willing to leave their home and travel into the unknown?

00:14:21.639 --> 00:14:36.980
Mother, I'm back.

00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:45.009
Hello, my dear.

00:14:45.009 --> 00:14:46.009
Rebecca!

00:14:46.009 --> 00:14:49.009
Your cousin has been looking for you.

00:14:49.009 --> 00:14:51.009
Anna, I'm over here.

00:14:51.009 --> 00:14:55.320
Rebecca, can you bring this to father?

00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:57.320
Yeah, is he still working?

00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:58.320
Still working.

00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:03.240
Rebecca, I've been looking for you. Can I come with you?

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:10.639
Sure.

00:15:10.639 --> 00:15:11.639
Hello, father.

00:15:11.639 --> 00:15:13.639
My husband said you needed this.

00:15:13.639 --> 00:15:14.639
Thank you.

00:15:14.639 --> 00:15:25.600
Can I help with anything?

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:35.059
You can come with me to the well.

00:15:35.059 --> 00:15:38.059
Not today. We need your help making dinner.

00:15:38.059 --> 00:15:39.059
Okay.

00:15:39.059 --> 00:15:48.289
Good day.

00:15:48.289 --> 00:16:04.940
Please, give me a little sip of water from your jar.

00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:05.940
Drink, my lord.

00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:18.220
I will also water your camels until they are done drinking.

00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:54.690
Excuse me, my lord.

00:16:54.690 --> 00:16:58.690
Please tell me, who's daughter are you?

00:16:58.690 --> 00:17:02.690
Is there any room in your father's house for us to spend the night?

00:17:02.690 --> 00:17:19.880
I will not eat until I have told you what I have to say.

00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:22.880
Please, speak.

00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:25.880
I am Abraham Servant.

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:30.880
And Jehovah has blessed my master very much.

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:33.880
Sarah, the wife of my master,

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:37.880
bore a son to my master after she grew old.

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:41.880
So my master made me swear saying,

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:47.380
you will go to the house of my father to my family.

00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:51.380
You must take a wife for my son.

00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:55.380
But I said to my master, what if the woman is unwilling to come?

00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:59.299
He said to me,

00:17:59.299 --> 00:18:02.299
Jehovah will send his angel with you

00:18:02.299 --> 00:18:05.299
and will certainly give success to your journey.

00:18:05.299 --> 00:18:09.299
When I got to the spring today,

00:18:09.299 --> 00:18:14.299
I said, Jehovah, the God of my master Abraham.

00:18:14.299 --> 00:18:17.299
If you will make my journey successful,

00:18:17.299 --> 00:18:21.299
here I am standing at a spring.

00:18:21.299 --> 00:18:25.650
When a young woman comes out to draw water,

00:18:25.650 --> 00:18:28.650
I will say, please,

00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:30.650
let me drink a little water from your jar.

00:18:30.650 --> 00:18:32.650
And she will say to me,

00:18:32.650 --> 00:18:34.650
you take a drink,

00:18:34.650 --> 00:18:38.650
and I will also draw water for your camels.

00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:44.650
Let that woman be the one whom Jehovah has chosen for the son of my master.

00:18:44.650 --> 00:18:49.960
Before I was finished speaking in my heart,

00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:55.960
there was Rebecca coming out with her jar on her shoulder.

00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:59.960
After that, I asked her, whose daughter are you?

00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:02.960
To which she replied the daughter of Bethul.

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:06.960
So I put the ring on her nose

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:09.960
and the bracelets on her hands.

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:11.960
And now tell me,

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:14.960
if you wish to show loyal love

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:18.960
and faithfulness to my master.

00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:20.960
But if not,

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:22.960
tell me,

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:25.960
that I may proceed one way or the other.

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:34.680
This is from Jehovah.

00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:38.960
Let her become a wife to the son of your master,

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:40.960
just as Jehovah has spoken.

00:19:40.960 --> 00:20:14.190
The negab is far.

00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:24.349
When will you come back?

00:20:24.349 --> 00:20:26.349
I can't you just stay here.

00:20:26.349 --> 00:20:28.349
You heard what my father said.

00:20:28.349 --> 00:20:30.349
This is from Jehovah.

00:20:30.349 --> 00:20:37.309
You can serve Jehovah here.

00:20:37.309 --> 00:20:44.210
That is true.

00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:46.210
What do you know?

00:20:46.210 --> 00:20:48.210
Jehovah will bless you

00:20:48.210 --> 00:20:53.960
in ways you can't even imagine.

00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:56.960
We still have time together.

00:20:56.960 --> 00:21:07.220
Let's make the most of it.

00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:37.660
Why me?

00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:56.569
Gather all the men, prepare the camels.

00:21:56.569 --> 00:21:57.569
We must leave soon.

00:21:57.569 --> 00:21:58.569
Right away.

00:21:58.569 --> 00:22:01.880
Why are you packing?

00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:04.880
Please, send me off to my master.

00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:07.880
Let the young woman stay with us for ten more days.

00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:09.880
At least ten more days.

00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:11.880
She can go.

00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:13.880
Do not detain me.

00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:16.880
Seeing that Jehovah has made my journey successful,

00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:18.880
send me off

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:20.880
in order that I may go to my master.

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:24.160
Let us call the young woman

00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:26.160
and inquire of her.

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:31.450
Rebecca,

00:22:31.450 --> 00:23:13.680
at least we're wants to leave right now.

00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:28.609
Will you go with this man?

00:23:28.609 --> 00:24:29.829
I'm willing to go.

00:24:29.829 --> 00:24:35.089
Rebecca,

00:24:35.089 --> 00:24:36.089
our sister,

00:24:36.089 --> 00:24:41.750
may you become thousands times ten thousand.

00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:43.750
And let your offspring take possession

00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:45.750
of the gate of those who hate them.

00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:50.369
Praise Jehovah.

00:24:50.369 --> 00:24:53.869
Praise Jehovah.

00:24:53.869 --> 00:25:21.089
I'll miss you.

00:25:21.089 --> 00:25:24.089
Rebecca did not know what lay before her.

00:25:24.089 --> 00:25:28.089
And there is no record that she saw her family again.

00:25:28.089 --> 00:25:36.859
She showed faith when she left the comfort of home.

00:25:36.859 --> 00:25:40.859
Jehovah blessed her as an ancestor of the Messiah.

00:25:40.859 --> 00:25:46.970
Her faith is worthy of our imitation.

00:25:46.970 --> 00:25:59.319
Overall, Rebecca had a life of few regrets.

00:25:59.319 --> 00:26:03.319
The opportunity for the same blessing is there for you too,

00:26:03.319 --> 00:26:07.319
if you imitate the faith of Rebecca.

00:26:07.319 --> 00:26:12.319
Some people feel that faith and science are at odds.

00:26:12.319 --> 00:26:16.319
They say that a thinking person cannot believe in God.

00:26:16.319 --> 00:26:18.319
Is that true?

00:26:18.319 --> 00:26:23.319
See how these young people use science to build their faith.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.000
When you believe in creation,

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.000
what challenges might you face?

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.000
My favorite subject for science,

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.000
because I learned facts about how things are connected.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.000
I thought that was really exciting,

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.000
seeing how the physical world works.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.000
But then you come to a topic like evolution.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.000
And you immediately know that there's something here

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.000
that's not quite right.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:58.000
In 5th grade, when I was around 12,

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.000
we had science, my worst subject.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:04.000
The teacher was fully convinced that we descended from apes

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:07.000
and that the evolution theory is the truth.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:13.000
You realize that you're probably the only one in that room thinking

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.000
this is not true.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:19.000
Then you might start questioning yourself.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.000
Is the teacher wrong?

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:26.000
Or have I maybe believed something wrong my whole life?

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.000
It's a little challenging,

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.000
being alone in such a situation.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:36.819
What helped you to build your faith in a creator?

00:27:36.819 --> 00:27:38.819
I spent a lot of time on the bus,

00:27:38.819 --> 00:27:40.819
to and from school,

00:27:40.819 --> 00:27:41.819
readingjw.org,

00:27:41.819 --> 00:27:44.819
and the five questions brochure.

00:27:44.819 --> 00:27:48.819
Actually, to make up my mind on what I believe in.

00:27:48.819 --> 00:27:51.819
I did a lot of research when I got home that evening,

00:27:51.819 --> 00:27:54.819
and my parents helped me search on our website.

00:27:54.819 --> 00:27:56.819
What helped me the most was the video,

00:27:56.819 --> 00:27:57.819
what your peers say,

00:27:57.819 --> 00:27:58.819
belief in God.

00:27:58.819 --> 00:28:01.819
I remember one small scene that stuck with me.

00:28:01.819 --> 00:28:04.819
It was a glass bottle that was pulled up from the sand.

00:28:04.819 --> 00:28:06.819
Yes, it's made of the same material,

00:28:06.819 --> 00:28:09.819
but it definitely didn't form by itself.

00:28:09.819 --> 00:28:13.819
There has to be someone that turns it into a glass bottle.

00:28:13.819 --> 00:28:15.819
And I found that very logical.

00:28:15.819 --> 00:28:19.819
It really convinced me that there is a creator.

00:28:19.819 --> 00:28:22.819
I remember there are three things necessary for life.

00:28:22.819 --> 00:28:26.819
I learned it was RNA, DNA, and proteins.

00:28:26.819 --> 00:28:30.819
If they were to exist at the same place and at the same time,

00:28:30.819 --> 00:28:32.819
that would be very rare.

00:28:32.819 --> 00:28:34.819
And on top of that,

00:28:34.819 --> 00:28:36.819
it would be as if those three things

00:28:36.819 --> 00:28:38.819
then should team up and say,

00:28:38.819 --> 00:28:40.819
we would like to create life.

00:28:40.819 --> 00:28:42.819
A cell that in turn would become an animal,

00:28:42.819 --> 00:28:45.819
a person, or many other things.

00:28:45.819 --> 00:28:48.819
This made me realize that believing this

00:28:48.819 --> 00:28:50.819
would require even more faith

00:28:50.819 --> 00:28:52.819
than believing that there is a God

00:28:52.819 --> 00:28:54.819
who has created everything.

00:28:54.819 --> 00:28:57.819
So, I sent a text message to my teacher

00:28:57.819 --> 00:29:00.819
with my viewpoints about me believing in a creator

00:29:00.819 --> 00:29:03.819
and added a link to the video.

00:29:03.819 --> 00:29:05.819
He then asked if it was okay

00:29:05.819 --> 00:29:08.819
if I showed the video to the class.

00:29:08.819 --> 00:29:11.819
And I said, of course,

00:29:11.819 --> 00:29:13.819
I watched the video so many times

00:29:13.819 --> 00:29:15.819
that I knew all who lines by heart

00:29:15.819 --> 00:29:19.819
and knew exactly which scene came one and what hair.

00:29:19.819 --> 00:29:22.819
So that if someone in the class had any questions,

00:29:22.819 --> 00:29:24.819
I would know the answer.

00:29:24.819 --> 00:29:27.819
The last five minutes, I got to appear in front of the class,

00:29:27.819 --> 00:29:30.819
explained a little about Jehovah's Witnesses

00:29:30.819 --> 00:29:32.819
and that we believe in a creator

00:29:32.819 --> 00:29:35.819
and said I had a video that convinced me of that.

00:29:35.819 --> 00:29:37.819
And when I was about to press start,

00:29:37.819 --> 00:29:39.819
the bell rang for a break.

00:29:39.819 --> 00:29:42.819
But everyone stayed in the classroom to watch the video.

00:29:42.819 --> 00:29:45.819
I thought that was really fun.

00:29:45.819 --> 00:29:48.819
How does having faith in a loving creator help you?

00:29:49.819 --> 00:29:53.819
It makes everything more meaningful.

00:29:53.819 --> 00:29:55.819
You're not thinking,

00:29:55.819 --> 00:29:57.819
here I am,

00:29:57.819 --> 00:30:00.819
I'll just live the way I do till I die.

00:30:00.819 --> 00:30:02.819
And that's it.

00:30:02.819 --> 00:30:04.819
You believe that there is a purpose to life

00:30:04.819 --> 00:30:06.819
and it also opens the possibility

00:30:06.819 --> 00:30:09.819
of a hope for the future.

00:30:09.819 --> 00:30:11.819
Around us, there are so many people

00:30:11.819 --> 00:30:14.819
who have different views and theories

00:30:14.819 --> 00:30:17.819
and that can have a big impact on us.

00:30:18.819 --> 00:30:20.819
So if you don't have a strong faith,

00:30:20.819 --> 00:30:23.819
then someone can pick away at your faith

00:30:23.819 --> 00:30:26.819
and try to break it down.

00:30:26.819 --> 00:30:28.819
Yes, I am very grateful

00:30:28.819 --> 00:30:31.819
that my parents taught me about creation.

00:30:31.819 --> 00:30:34.819
So I always knew that there is a loving father out there

00:30:34.819 --> 00:30:37.819
who has created all the beautiful things for us.

00:30:37.819 --> 00:30:39.819
You can just go out into nature.

00:30:39.819 --> 00:30:41.819
The sun is shining.

00:30:41.819 --> 00:30:43.819
Look at all the beautiful colors and autumn.

00:30:43.819 --> 00:30:45.819
It's so nice.

00:30:45.819 --> 00:30:48.819
What you can do is really just be grateful.

00:30:48.819 --> 00:30:52.819
Now I am 100% convinced that creation,

00:30:52.819 --> 00:30:54.819
it is a fact.

00:30:54.819 --> 00:31:07.829
That's how it must have begun.

00:31:07.829 --> 00:31:10.829
These young people had doubts,

00:31:10.829 --> 00:31:13.829
but they faced them head on.

00:31:13.829 --> 00:31:15.829
You can too.

00:31:15.829 --> 00:31:18.829
Don't be afraid to talk to mature Christians.

00:31:18.829 --> 00:31:22.829
Do your research and reason on what you learn.

00:31:22.829 --> 00:31:24.829
To make inaccurate knowledge,

00:31:24.829 --> 00:31:27.829
you'll find satisfying answers.

00:31:27.829 --> 00:31:30.829
That's what Cotry wanted.

00:31:30.829 --> 00:31:33.829
Answers to life's big questions.

00:31:33.829 --> 00:31:36.829
She was a Lutheran priest in Finland.

00:31:36.829 --> 00:31:39.829
How would she find real truth?

00:31:39.829 --> 00:31:45.930
Let's find out.

00:31:45.930 --> 00:31:49.930
My mother taught me from a very young age to pray.

00:31:49.930 --> 00:31:53.930
For us, it meant chatting openly with our Heavenly Father.

00:31:53.930 --> 00:31:57.940
Every day conversation,

00:31:57.940 --> 00:31:59.940
that was a valuable life lesson

00:31:59.940 --> 00:32:04.829
that has empowered me throughout my life.

00:32:04.829 --> 00:32:08.829
Growing up, I always wanted to become a teacher.

00:32:08.829 --> 00:32:11.829
But after reflecting on it a bit more,

00:32:11.829 --> 00:32:15.829
I realized that what I really wanted to do with my life

00:32:15.829 --> 00:32:18.829
was to work for the Kingdom of Heaven.

00:32:18.829 --> 00:32:22.829
So, how could I do both?

00:32:22.829 --> 00:32:25.829
I decided to pursue a career in theology.

00:32:25.829 --> 00:32:28.829
My goal was to become an instructor in the church.

00:32:28.829 --> 00:32:33.299
When I started working for the church,

00:32:33.299 --> 00:32:37.299
I quickly discovered that the teachings of the church

00:32:37.299 --> 00:32:42.740
contradict what the Bible says.

00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:45.740
One question left unanswered by the church was,

00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:48.740
why suffering exists?

00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:51.740
A pastor could only stammer and say,

00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:55.740
well, it can't be explained because it's a mystery.

00:32:55.740 --> 00:32:58.740
But I didn't think the existence of suffering

00:32:58.740 --> 00:33:03.529
could be a mystery at all.

00:33:03.529 --> 00:33:06.529
I realized that I had to find a way

00:33:06.529 --> 00:33:10.900
to satisfy my conscience

00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:14.900
and still uphold the position of the church.

00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:17.900
So, while I was teaching, I would explain,

00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:20.900
this is what the church teaches.

00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:23.900
But this is what the Bible says.

00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:25.900
If you want to learn something,

00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:28.900
what do you want to learn?

00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:39.480
And then, the most tragic moment of my life happened.

00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:42.480
I was 22 years old

00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:45.480
and in the middle of planning for my wedding,

00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:54.160
when my fiance died in a car accident.

00:33:54.160 --> 00:34:02.519
Of course, this changed my life completely.

00:34:02.519 --> 00:34:09.230
It was the most painful feeling.

00:34:09.230 --> 00:34:12.230
I just knew deep down that now,

00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:15.230
I would never marry or have a family of my own.

00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:19.800
So, I had to find a way to survive,

00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:22.800
day after day, year after year,

00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:29.300
and look for another way to leave something meaningful behind.

00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:32.300
So, I buried myself in my work.

00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:37.510
The position at the church that I had been working toward

00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:42.510
was discontinued and changed to the role of a priest.

00:34:42.510 --> 00:34:47.510
Altogether, I did congregational work for 33 years.

00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:51.510
And then, when my health couldn't take it anymore,

00:34:51.510 --> 00:34:56.050
I did other tasks for the church.

00:34:56.050 --> 00:34:59.050
I was giving everything I had to give.

00:34:59.050 --> 00:35:04.940
But whenever I looked to the church to give something to me,

00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:10.079
I was always left empty.

00:35:10.079 --> 00:35:12.079
I prayed for many years.

00:35:12.079 --> 00:35:17.079
Lord, help me find my real spiritual home.

00:35:17.079 --> 00:35:20.079
This was my prayer for about 10 years.

00:35:20.079 --> 00:35:27.510
And then one day, I came across Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:35:27.510 --> 00:35:32.269
Immediately, I said to my Heavenly Father,

00:35:32.269 --> 00:35:36.269
this is what I have been searching for.

00:35:48.269 --> 00:35:50.269
What do you have for me?

00:35:50.269 --> 00:35:54.269
That was the first thing I asked them.

00:35:54.269 --> 00:35:59.269
The first meeting I attended made a big impression on me.

00:35:59.269 --> 00:36:03.269
I remember, in particular, the verse in the Gospel of John,

00:36:03.269 --> 00:36:06.269
by this, all will know that you are my disciples,

00:36:06.269 --> 00:36:09.269
if you have love in your midst.

00:36:09.269 --> 00:36:14.269
And I thought, I've been searching for this all my life.

00:36:14.269 --> 00:36:18.269
And this is it. It's right here.

00:36:24.070 --> 00:36:27.070
My closest friend was deeply shocked when I told her

00:36:27.070 --> 00:36:30.070
that I was going to leave the church

00:36:30.070 --> 00:36:33.070
to become one of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:36:33.070 --> 00:36:36.070
When she calmed down, she said,

00:36:36.070 --> 00:36:40.070
I will support you, as I always have,

00:36:40.070 --> 00:36:44.070
but promise me you won't change.

00:36:44.070 --> 00:36:48.070
Four years later, she came to visit me again.

00:36:48.070 --> 00:36:52.070
She kept watching me closely

00:36:52.070 --> 00:36:57.070
and said, you have changed.

00:36:57.070 --> 00:37:03.380
I was startled and asked, in what way?

00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:13.289
She said, it looks to me like you're happy.

00:37:13.289 --> 00:37:21.369
My prayer to find a spiritual home was answered.

00:37:21.369 --> 00:37:28.369
And I experienced the great miracle of finally finding

00:37:28.369 --> 00:37:32.369
what I had been looking for my entire life.

00:37:32.369 --> 00:37:43.579
We are glad, Cotry, found the spiritual home she prayed for.

00:37:43.579 --> 00:37:47.579
A painful loss was a turning point for her.

00:37:47.579 --> 00:37:52.579
Suffering can cause any of us to wonder, why me?

00:37:52.579 --> 00:37:56.579
Why now? Does God care?

00:37:56.579 --> 00:37:59.579
Brother David's plan of the governing body

00:37:59.579 --> 00:38:02.579
examines how we can quell the squighting thoughts

00:38:02.579 --> 00:38:06.579
in the following morning worship.

00:38:06.579 --> 00:38:10.579
Have you ever gone into trouble trying to do the right thing?

00:38:10.579 --> 00:38:14.579
If you have, think about Jacob.

00:38:14.579 --> 00:38:17.579
Now Jacob did the right thing.

00:38:17.579 --> 00:38:21.579
Rather than marry out of the truth like his brother Esau,

00:38:21.579 --> 00:38:25.579
he traveled to the home of a believing relative, Laman,

00:38:25.579 --> 00:38:29.579
and asked for the hand of his daughter, Rachel.

00:38:29.579 --> 00:38:32.579
I didn't work out so well.

00:38:32.579 --> 00:38:36.579
Jacob was tricked by Laman into marrying both Rachel

00:38:36.579 --> 00:38:39.579
and her older sister, Leah.

00:38:39.579 --> 00:38:42.579
And the women didn't get along very well.

00:38:42.579 --> 00:38:46.579
In fact, they acted more like rivals than like family.

00:38:46.579 --> 00:38:51.579
Now Jehovah saw what Laman was up to, but he didn't intervene.

00:38:51.579 --> 00:38:55.579
And Jacob didn't blame Jehovah, as if to say,

00:38:55.579 --> 00:38:58.579
well, why is this happening to me?

00:38:58.579 --> 00:39:01.579
I followed instructions. I did the right thing

00:39:01.579 --> 00:39:03.579
and had a look where I am today.

00:39:03.579 --> 00:39:06.579
No, that wasn't Jacob.

00:39:06.579 --> 00:39:09.579
Now later on, Jehovah fixed the matter

00:39:09.579 --> 00:39:12.579
by giving the law to Israel.

00:39:12.579 --> 00:39:16.579
You must not take a woman in addition to her sister

00:39:16.579 --> 00:39:19.579
as a rival wife.

00:39:19.579 --> 00:39:21.579
Well, that law seems to have Leah and Rachel

00:39:21.579 --> 00:39:23.579
written all over it, doesn't it?

00:39:23.579 --> 00:39:27.579
But in the meantime, he did sustain Jacob.

00:39:27.579 --> 00:39:32.579
He did help Jacob through his trial.

00:39:32.579 --> 00:39:35.579
Now a bright spot, in all this, was Joseph,

00:39:35.579 --> 00:39:38.579
and he's the subject of our comment today.

00:39:38.579 --> 00:39:40.579
The Jehovah began dealing with Joseph

00:39:40.579 --> 00:39:44.579
when he was just a teenager, and he gave him two dreams.

00:39:44.579 --> 00:39:47.579
Now the first dream was about food,

00:39:47.579 --> 00:39:50.579
sheaves of wheat.

00:39:50.579 --> 00:39:53.579
Sheaves bowed down to his sheath.

00:39:53.579 --> 00:39:55.579
Now that was appropriate, wasn't it?

00:39:55.579 --> 00:39:58.579
Because later on, not only Joseph's brothers,

00:39:58.579 --> 00:40:01.579
but almost everyone in the known world

00:40:01.579 --> 00:40:04.579
was going to look to Joseph for food.

00:40:04.579 --> 00:40:07.579
Now the second dream included his father,

00:40:07.579 --> 00:40:10.579
and strangely, his mother,

00:40:10.579 --> 00:40:13.579
who had died giving birth to Benjamin.

00:40:13.579 --> 00:40:16.579
Now in that dream, the sun, moon,

00:40:16.579 --> 00:40:19.579
and eleven stars, that would include Benjamin,

00:40:19.579 --> 00:40:22.579
bowed down to Joseph.

00:40:22.579 --> 00:40:24.579
Now there's no record that Joseph ever attempted

00:40:24.579 --> 00:40:26.579
to interpret that dream.

00:40:26.579 --> 00:40:29.579
But Jacob and his sons got the point,

00:40:29.579 --> 00:40:32.579
and they were offended.

00:40:32.579 --> 00:40:35.579
Jacob kind of accused Joseph of being presumptuous.

00:40:35.579 --> 00:40:40.579
He said, am I your mother and your brothers

00:40:40.579 --> 00:40:44.579
really going to come and bow down to the earth to you?

00:40:44.579 --> 00:40:47.579
Now we won't comment on the fact that

00:40:47.579 --> 00:40:52.579
Jacob automatically assumed that he was the sun in that dream.

00:40:52.579 --> 00:40:57.579
But by means of the dreams, what was Jehovah telling Joseph?

00:40:57.579 --> 00:41:01.579
He was telling Joseph that he had something special in mind for him.

00:41:01.579 --> 00:41:04.579
He had a purpose for Joseph.

00:41:04.579 --> 00:41:07.579
So what do you suppose the devil wanted to do?

00:41:07.579 --> 00:41:10.579
Well, a devil wanted to frustrate that purpose.

00:41:10.579 --> 00:41:14.579
He wanted to keep that purpose from being fulfilled.

00:41:14.579 --> 00:41:18.579
So Satan must have been overjoyed when he heard Joseph's brothers

00:41:18.579 --> 00:41:21.579
plotting to put him to death.

00:41:21.579 --> 00:41:24.579
Would they have followed through with it?

00:41:24.579 --> 00:41:27.579
Think about Simeon and Levi.

00:41:27.579 --> 00:41:30.579
They didn't hesitate to mow down all the men of Sheikam

00:41:30.579 --> 00:41:34.579
when one man raped their sister.

00:41:34.579 --> 00:41:38.579
Now the oldest of the brothers, 24-year-old Ruben,

00:41:38.579 --> 00:41:41.579
talks the others into sparing Joseph's life.

00:41:41.579 --> 00:41:44.579
Now did Jehovah move him to do that?

00:41:44.579 --> 00:41:45.579
That could be.

00:41:45.579 --> 00:41:47.579
But certainly in line with his purpose.

00:41:47.579 --> 00:41:52.579
So instead of telling Joseph, his brothers sell him to a band of Ishmaelites.

00:41:52.579 --> 00:41:55.579
Now I want you to tuck that in the back of your mind.

00:41:55.579 --> 00:41:59.579
Ishmaelites, because we're going to come back to that a little later.

00:41:59.579 --> 00:42:02.579
So the Ishmaelites bring Joseph down to Egypt

00:42:02.579 --> 00:42:05.579
and he becomes a slave to Pottiefar,

00:42:05.579 --> 00:42:09.579
the chief of Pharaoh's bodyguard.

00:42:09.579 --> 00:42:11.579
Now Joseph is a slave.

00:42:11.579 --> 00:42:15.579
What happens three years later?

00:42:15.579 --> 00:42:18.579
His grandfather Isaac dies.

00:42:18.579 --> 00:42:22.579
And Joseph, the slave, can't be there to say goodbye.

00:42:22.579 --> 00:42:27.579
Kind of reminds us of many of us during this pandemic, doesn't it?

00:42:27.579 --> 00:42:32.579
But as with us, Jehovah was with Joseph.

00:42:32.579 --> 00:42:35.579
He was a great success in Pottiefar's household

00:42:35.579 --> 00:42:39.579
until Pottiefar's wife accused him of rape

00:42:39.579 --> 00:42:43.579
and Pottiefar threw Joseph into prison.

00:42:43.579 --> 00:42:46.579
But we can say that Jehovah was with Joseph

00:42:46.579 --> 00:42:50.579
because he went to prison.

00:42:50.579 --> 00:42:53.579
Why can we say that?

00:42:53.579 --> 00:42:56.579
Prison was probably the mildest form of punishment

00:42:56.579 --> 00:42:58.579
that Joseph could have suffered.

00:42:58.579 --> 00:43:01.579
He was a Hebrew slave and under Egyptian law,

00:43:01.579 --> 00:43:04.579
Pottiefar could have killed him on the spot

00:43:04.579 --> 00:43:06.579
because of the accusations.

00:43:06.579 --> 00:43:08.579
Or he could have had Joseph arrested

00:43:08.579 --> 00:43:13.579
and the court could have ordered a thousand lashes.

00:43:13.579 --> 00:43:17.579
Joseph would probably have died under the lash.

00:43:17.579 --> 00:43:21.579
Well, that gives us perspective when we read in the Mosaic law

00:43:21.579 --> 00:43:25.579
that an Israelite could receive up to forty strokes of the rod.

00:43:25.579 --> 00:43:28.579
Not a thousand lashes.

00:43:28.579 --> 00:43:30.579
This was love on Jehovah's part.

00:43:30.579 --> 00:43:33.579
He wanted to prevent the Israelites

00:43:33.579 --> 00:43:37.579
from being cruel like the Egyptians.

00:43:37.579 --> 00:43:40.579
Now, let's use our imagination a little bit.

00:43:40.579 --> 00:43:43.579
Later on, Joseph interprets a dream for Pharaoh.

00:43:43.579 --> 00:43:46.579
And Pharaoh makes him his chief advisor.

00:43:46.579 --> 00:43:50.579
Now, imagine, Joseph kneels and receives the signet ring

00:43:50.579 --> 00:43:52.579
from Pharaoh.

00:43:52.579 --> 00:43:55.579
He rises and takes a step back.

00:43:55.579 --> 00:43:57.579
Out of the corner of his eye,

00:43:57.579 --> 00:44:00.579
he sees someone standing near the throne.

00:44:00.579 --> 00:44:05.579
Someone who's trying to make himself very small.

00:44:05.579 --> 00:44:10.579
Pottiefar, the chief of the bodyguard.

00:44:10.579 --> 00:44:13.579
I don't know about you, but that possibility

00:44:13.579 --> 00:44:15.579
makes me smile when I think about it.

00:44:15.579 --> 00:44:17.579
And can you imagine what happened

00:44:17.579 --> 00:44:19.579
when Pottiefar went home to lunch that day

00:44:19.579 --> 00:44:24.579
and told his wife who was now his new boss?

00:44:24.579 --> 00:44:29.019
I wonder how much sleep she lost over that.

00:44:29.019 --> 00:44:32.019
Pottiefar's wife did a terrible thing.

00:44:32.019 --> 00:44:34.019
But so did Joseph's brothers.

00:44:34.019 --> 00:44:36.019
In fact, if the law had been enforced,

00:44:36.019 --> 00:44:39.019
Joseph's brothers would have been put to death for kidnapping.

00:44:39.019 --> 00:44:44.019
Later, Jehovah made kidnapping a capital offense.

00:44:44.019 --> 00:44:48.019
He may have had Joseph's brothers in mind when he did that.

00:44:48.019 --> 00:44:52.019
Now, some think that Simeon masterminded the kidnapping plot.

00:44:52.019 --> 00:44:56.019
And that might explain why Joseph chose him to stay behind

00:44:56.019 --> 00:44:59.019
when he sent the rest of his brothers home.

00:44:59.019 --> 00:45:01.019
Now, let's get back to Jehovah's purpose.

00:45:01.019 --> 00:45:03.019
Jehovah has a purpose for Joseph,

00:45:03.019 --> 00:45:06.019
and Joseph brings the family down to Egypt.

00:45:06.019 --> 00:45:09.019
Now, that's part of the prophecy, but there's more.

00:45:09.019 --> 00:45:12.019
Gone told Abraham that his descendants

00:45:12.019 --> 00:45:17.019
would be afflicted by foreigners for 400 years.

00:45:17.019 --> 00:45:21.019
Well, Israel left Egypt in 1513 BCE,

00:45:21.019 --> 00:45:24.019
so when did the 400-year start?

00:45:24.019 --> 00:45:26.019
In 1913.

00:45:26.019 --> 00:45:28.019
What happened that year?

00:45:28.019 --> 00:45:30.019
Isaac's half-brother.

00:45:30.019 --> 00:45:32.019
What was his name again?

00:45:32.019 --> 00:45:34.019
Ishmael.

00:45:34.019 --> 00:45:37.019
Ishmael persecuted Isaac.

00:45:37.019 --> 00:45:40.019
But was Ishmael a foreigner?

00:45:40.019 --> 00:45:44.019
His mother was an Egyptian slave.

00:45:44.019 --> 00:45:48.019
At his descendants, the Ishmaelites had Egyptian blood,

00:45:48.019 --> 00:45:51.019
interesting that the Israelites

00:45:51.019 --> 00:45:53.019
followed in the family tradition

00:45:53.019 --> 00:45:57.019
by crucicuting Isaac's grandson, Joseph.

00:45:57.019 --> 00:46:01.019
Jehovah didn't incite Joseph's brothers to kidnap him

00:46:01.019 --> 00:46:03.019
and send him down to Egypt,

00:46:03.019 --> 00:46:07.019
but he did use the event to carry out his purpose.

00:46:07.019 --> 00:46:11.019
He didn't always prevent bad things from happening to Jacob,

00:46:11.019 --> 00:46:13.019
like marrying sisters who didn't get along,

00:46:13.019 --> 00:46:16.019
or to Joseph, like being falsely accused.

00:46:16.019 --> 00:46:18.019
He didn't put a head around them,

00:46:18.019 --> 00:46:21.019
but he did help both of them to face their trials

00:46:21.019 --> 00:46:23.019
every step of the way.

00:46:23.019 --> 00:46:25.019
He did that for them.

00:46:25.019 --> 00:46:28.019
He'll do it for you, too.

00:46:28.019 --> 00:46:32.019
So if you ever get in trouble trying to do the right thing,

00:46:32.019 --> 00:46:33.019
think of Jacob.

00:46:33.019 --> 00:46:35.019
Think of Jehovah.

00:46:35.019 --> 00:46:37.019
Jehovah will help you.

00:46:37.019 --> 00:46:40.019
He will never abandon you.

00:46:40.019 --> 00:46:42.019
To see Jehovah's support,

00:46:42.019 --> 00:46:46.019
we may have to set aside time to meditate.

00:46:46.019 --> 00:46:48.019
In this month's music video,

00:46:48.019 --> 00:46:51.019
we see just how powerful it is

00:46:51.019 --> 00:46:54.019
to take a break, take a breath,

00:46:54.019 --> 00:47:02.300
and take in God's creation.

00:47:02.300 --> 00:47:04.300
Sitting around the fire,

00:47:04.300 --> 00:47:08.300
beneath the million stars,

00:47:08.300 --> 00:47:12.300
letting go of the cares of the day we share,

00:47:12.300 --> 00:47:15.300
the reflections of our art.

00:47:15.300 --> 00:47:19.300
It's so nice to make the time

00:47:19.300 --> 00:47:22.300
to think of all that good.

00:47:22.300 --> 00:47:24.300
Daily gifts from above,

00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:26.300
how God shows us His love.

00:47:26.300 --> 00:47:29.300
Feel us with gratitude.

00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:35.019
We're just taking a moment

00:47:35.019 --> 00:47:40.019
to change our focus.

00:47:40.019 --> 00:47:45.019
Slowing down to a cup and reflite,

00:47:45.019 --> 00:47:49.019
on the simple things

00:47:49.019 --> 00:47:54.019
that joy it brings to slow down,

00:47:54.019 --> 00:47:57.019
to take a deep breath,

00:47:57.019 --> 00:48:00.019
voice and reset.

00:48:00.019 --> 00:48:17.510
Shines through.

00:48:17.510 --> 00:48:19.510
Our spirits are lifted,

00:48:19.510 --> 00:48:23.920
arms from our father up high,

00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:29.989
as we see the big eyes we face.

00:48:29.989 --> 00:48:37.900
Our Jehovah's warm and brave.

00:48:37.900 --> 00:49:00.579
We're just taking on the things to slow down,

00:49:00.579 --> 00:49:06.090
to take a deep breath and reset.

00:49:06.090 --> 00:50:24.900
Our thinking ability will enrich our life now

00:50:24.900 --> 00:50:26.900
in so many ways.

00:50:26.900 --> 00:50:30.900
We'll make wise decisions that draw us closer to Jehovah.

00:50:30.900 --> 00:50:36.500
We'll address any doubts to our faith.

00:50:36.500 --> 00:50:41.909
We'll safeguard the practical wisdom we've found in the Bible,

00:50:41.909 --> 00:50:46.909
and we'll secure a perfect life in the future.

00:50:46.909 --> 00:50:50.159
In our postcard for the month,

00:50:50.159 --> 00:50:52.159
we'll visit Burundi.

00:50:52.159 --> 00:50:56.159
It's located in the often called Heart of Africa,

00:50:56.159 --> 00:51:00.159
bordered on the southwest by Lake Tanganika.

00:51:00.159 --> 00:51:03.159
Burundi is full of green rolling hills,

00:51:03.159 --> 00:51:05.159
cascading waterfalls,

00:51:05.159 --> 00:51:09.159
and rich agricultural land.

00:51:09.159 --> 00:51:13.159
Lake Tanganika is the longest freshwater lake in the world,

00:51:13.159 --> 00:51:16.159
and the second deepest.

00:51:16.159 --> 00:51:20.159
It's absolutely bursting with life.

00:51:20.159 --> 00:51:23.159
Over 2,000 species are found here,

00:51:23.159 --> 00:51:27.159
with 500 of them found nowhere else in the world.

00:51:27.159 --> 00:51:31.159
The local fishermen tap into this natural bounty,

00:51:31.159 --> 00:51:35.159
hauling in tons of fish every year.

00:51:35.159 --> 00:51:40.159
Burundi is also a preaching paradise for fishers of men.

00:51:40.159 --> 00:51:44.159
There are now over 17,000 publishers in the country,

00:51:44.159 --> 00:51:49.159
and they had an incredible memorial attendance in 2023

00:51:49.159 --> 00:51:53.159
of over 65,000 people.

00:51:53.159 --> 00:51:56.159
But it was not always like this.

00:51:56.159 --> 00:52:02.159
From 1977 to 1993, the preaching work was banned.

00:52:02.159 --> 00:52:07.159
Our brothers were persecuted and even imprisoned for their faith.

00:52:07.159 --> 00:52:12.159
Now when the opportunity comes to preach, they seize it.

00:52:12.159 --> 00:52:18.159
For example, Sara Nayonggeko walked 45 minutes to school each day,

00:52:18.159 --> 00:52:24.159
that way she could save money for preaching in seldom-work territory.

00:52:24.159 --> 00:52:26.159
The Burundi Bethel family,

00:52:26.159 --> 00:52:32.159
and the 83 publishers of the Bojumbura Hiho Shah Center congregation,

00:52:32.159 --> 00:52:37.159
send warm greetings to all their brothers and sisters.

00:52:37.159 --> 00:52:40.159
From the world headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:52:40.159 --> 00:52:44.159
this is JW Broadcasting.
