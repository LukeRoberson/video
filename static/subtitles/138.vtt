00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:06.519
I would like to talk about generosity as such a beautiful quality.

00:00:06.519 --> 00:00:09.519
We all like it when someone is generous to us,

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:11.519
but what about the other way around?

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.519
Ask yourself, would others in my family

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.519
or my congregation view me as being a generous person,

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:20.519
or might they view me as stingy,

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:23.519
or possibly oblivious to the needs of others?

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.519
Ephesians 5.1 urges us to become imitators of God.

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:31.519
Jehovah is very generous indeed.

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:34.520
Think of the ransom of his son.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:40.520
Jehovah generously brought back our future hope of everlasting life.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.520
Can we imitate his generosity?

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.520
At Luke 11 13, Jesus likened Jehovah to a loving parent.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.520
Just as a parent gives good gifts to his children,

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.520
Jesus said, how much more so will the Father in heaven

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.520
give Holy Spirit to those asking him?

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.520
Similarly, if anyone is in need of wisdom,

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.520
he can simply ask Jehovah.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.519
James chapter 1 verse 5 says that he gives generously

00:01:08.519 --> 00:01:10.519
and without reproaching.

00:01:10.519 --> 00:01:13.519
Jesus too was a generous person.

00:01:13.519 --> 00:01:15.519
Do you remember his first miracle?

00:01:15.519 --> 00:01:18.519
He was at a marriage feast, and the wine ran out

00:01:18.519 --> 00:01:22.519
to avoid embarrassment on the part of the newly married couple

00:01:22.519 --> 00:01:26.519
and to ensure that the guests enjoyed the rest of the meal,

00:01:26.519 --> 00:01:33.519
Jesus turned 100 gallons or almost 380 liters of water

00:01:33.519 --> 00:01:35.519
into fine wine.

00:01:35.519 --> 00:01:38.519
That was generous indeed.

00:01:38.519 --> 00:01:41.519
Now back to our earlier question.

00:01:41.519 --> 00:01:45.519
Do those in my family or my congregation view me

00:01:45.519 --> 00:01:47.519
as being a generous person?

00:01:47.519 --> 00:01:50.519
What are some ways that I can show generosity?

00:01:50.519 --> 00:01:55.250
Due to the economy in the past few years,

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.250
many of our brothers were out of work for a period of time.

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.250
The governing body is aware that many of you generously provided food

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.250
and even money so that their families could get by.

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.250
We commend you for your generosity.

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.250
In fact, that is exactly what Jehovah wanted you to do.

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.250
Due to the economy chapter 15 verse 10,

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.250
it says, you should generously give to him

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.250
and you should not give to him grudgingly.

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.250
For this is why Jehovah, your God,

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.250
will bless your every deed and undertaking.

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.250
Did you notice that we are to give,

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.250
but to do so with the right attitude?

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.250
He said not grudgingly,

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.250
and when we show such generosity,

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.250
Jehovah will indeed bless our every deed and undertaking.

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.250
Maybe you have experienced that.

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.250
When we give to others, often we find we are blessed with more

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.250
than we gave away in the first place.

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.250
Proverbs 11-24 makes that very point.

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.250
He says, one gives generously and ends up with more.

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:14.250
Jesus Himself said, practice giving and people will give to you.

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.250
In addition to providing materially to those in need,

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.250
how else can we demonstrate this spirit of giving?

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.250
In our May program,

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.250
Brethren let explain the goal of the governing body

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.250
to accelerate the building of places of worship

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.250
and other theocratic facilities.

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.250
We would like to take this opportunity

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.250
to thank you for your generous response

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.250
over the past few months

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.250
and for your continued support

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:49.250
of this all-important work.

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.250
Thank you very much.

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.250
How about this one?

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.250
Are we generous when it comes to forgiving those

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.250
who have offended us in some way?

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.250
Come again.

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:08.360
I ask if we are generous for givers.

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.360
The religious leaders in the first century

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:14.360
talk that you only had to forgive a person three times.

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.360
That was it.

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:19.360
Jesus taught Peter that that was being stingy,

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:22.360
knowing that three times was the limit.

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.360
The religious leaders established Peter no doubt thought.

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:31.360
He was generous when he asked Jesus at Matthew 1821,

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.360
how many times is my brother to sin against me

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.360
and am I to forgive him?

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.360
Up to seven times?

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:42.360
Peter likely thought he was being generous seven times.

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.360
That was more than twice the limit

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.360
that was established back then.

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.360
However, what did Jesus say in response?

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.360
You're too stingy, Peter.

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.360
In verse 22, Jesus said to him,

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.360
I say to you not up to seven times,

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.360
but up to 77 times.

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.360
Now that was generous.

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.360
We don't keep count.

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.360
Let's keep on forgiving our imperfect brothers and sisters.

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.360
Divine forgiveness is expensive.

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.360
It's generous.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.360
Psalm 86.5 says of Jehovah,

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:25.360
for you are good and ready to forgive.

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.360
How are we doing in this regard?

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:32.360
Are we ready to forgive when our feelings are heard?

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.360
Are we offended?

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.360
We can be generous with our time.

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.360
Are we quick to volunteer to clean or maintain the kingdom hall?

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:45.360
How about spending time visiting the sick or elderly

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.360
in our congregation?

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.360
Are helping a new student on the Theocratic ministry school

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.360
to prepare his talk?

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.360
Time is a precious commodity.

00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:01.360
Are we generous in doling it out for such noble purposes?

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:04.360
Speaking of giving of our time,

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:07.360
are we generous when it comes to the ministry?

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.360
At Philippians 1.5, Paul called it

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:14.360
the contribution you have made to the good news.

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:18.360
It's true all of us have different circumstances,

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:22.360
but if we look over our publisher record card

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.360
for the past six months,

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:27.360
would we consider ourselves to be generous

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:33.360
in the amount of time we devoted to sharing the good news?

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:40.360
Husbands, wives, parents, elders, pioneers, publishers?

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:44.360
Do we generously give commendation to others?

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:46.360
Problems 3.27 says,

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:51.360
do not withhold good from those to whom you should give it?

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:55.360
Do we sometimes withhold the commendation?

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:58.360
Why would we do that?

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:01.360
At times we simply forget to tell someone

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:04.360
what we appreciate about them.

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:08.360
On the other hand, some find it easy to commend those

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:11.360
who they consider are inferior to them,

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:14.360
or those who are superior to them.

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:19.360
But at times we might have trouble commending a peer.

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:22.360
We might think, if I commend him,

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:26.360
he might think he's better than I am.

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:31.360
Or suppose there is a brother who gave a very good talk

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:33.360
in the congregation,

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:38.360
but you were somewhat annoyed by his overuse of the expression.

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:40.360
You know what I mean?

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:44.360
We might feel that if we commend him on his talk,

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:50.360
that we're tacitly approving his overuse of that phrase,

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:52.360
do you know what I mean?

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:56.360
Why not sincerely commend him on something

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:59.360
you specifically appreciated about the talk?

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:02.360
Of course, if you are an elder,

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:05.360
or the Theocratic minister's school overseer,

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:09.360
you might bring the overuse phrase to his attention,

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:13.360
but after sincere commendation.

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:16.360
All of us appreciate commendation.

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:19.360
Three times, Jehovah's voice was heard

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:21.360
from the heavens giving him commendation,

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:23.360
approving his son.

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:25.360
In Revelation chapter two,

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:29.360
Jesus provides commendation to several congregations

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:31.360
in Asia Minor.

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:34.360
Yes, a word spoken at the right time.

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:37.360
How good it is.

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:41.360
At Acts 2035, Jesus has quoted as saying

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:48.360
there is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving.

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:50.360
With that simple statement,

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:55.360
Jesus captured the essence of true generosity.

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:58.360
A generous person gives freely of his time,

00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:02.360
energy and resources to benefit others.

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:06.360
And generosity is measured not by the size of the gift,

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:09.360
but by the motive of the giver.

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:14.360
Again, the governing body wanted me to take this opportunity

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:19.360
to thank all of you for your continued generous support

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:22.360
of the worldwide work.
