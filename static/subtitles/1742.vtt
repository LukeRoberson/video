00:00:01.419 --> 00:00:07.259
Sister Margarita Koneger has seen the growth of the Kingdom work all her life.

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:13.699
She has served as a missionary since 1966, and we met her in Hungary, where she has now

00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:15.939
served for about nine years.

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:31.379
Budapest to me, it's a pretty city, and I find it's like a melting pot, because many

00:00:31.379 --> 00:00:37.539
countries around, it's very international, it's Hungarian, but many people come through

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:43.060
from everywhere.

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:52.450
I'm a missionary in the Chinese field, and I'm here now nine years.

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:59.369
I'm now a missionary for 47 years, and my first assignment was Madagascar.

00:00:59.369 --> 00:01:03.609
We had good studies, the people were very nice, was very nice there.

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:10.769
I was four years in the house in Madagascar, because then we were banned, we had to leave,

00:01:10.769 --> 00:01:17.450
we were expelled, and we could take some lockage, but not everything, but we didn't have

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:18.450
much either.

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:25.329
And then we were sent to Kenya, after three years we were again banned.

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:32.530
And then we came to Benin, we went to preach a little bit with people what we knew, but

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.689
we had to be careful because they turned communists at that time.

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:47.810
Then the military came, and the police, and there were young people, also shouting slogans.

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:54.930
Ihu Zutantan, Ihu Zutantan for the liberty, we are ready, for the liberty we are ready,

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:02.170
and very excited, and surrounded the battle, and we couldn't go out anymore, and we were

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:03.170
bad people.

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:10.370
The next day, two policemen came, big man, you come, we bring you to Tugul.

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:14.490
Okay, we came, no lockage.

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:19.650
They brought us on the road to Tugul, we left, we were talking all the time and preaching

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:27.729
to them, and one was talking and one was praying, we talked to them all the time about

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:28.729
Chihuahua.

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:34.729
Then they stopped in the forest, and they said, come out, and Chihuahua must have given

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:42.930
us the right idea, we said, we don't come out, we prayed, we sat there, we didn't move.

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:48.009
And they were talking together, talking, we thought, even if they come, we do everything

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:53.810
what we can not to go out, and then they came, okay, let's go on.

00:02:53.810 --> 00:03:01.289
And they drove us on, but it was dangerous, I think it was the most dangerous time what

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:05.009
I can remember in my missionary service.

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:12.770
And just asked two girls, you know, and they went on again and brought us to Tugul, and

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:17.770
then we had to wait about four weeks or so until we got a new assignment, and it was

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:19.409
in Pukina Faso.

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:26.770
I was in this country, 23 years, when I went to the market, buying things, everybody knew

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:27.770
me.

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:31.289
Mata Mwaga, Mata Mwaga, they called me Mata Mwaga.

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:40.409
Mwaga is a, a must see, is a, a, a, a native, it's the tribe, the must see tribe, and

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:47.210
one of the must see is a Mwaga, so I'm a Mata Mwaga, because I spoke the language like

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:52.009
I spoke well, you know, I learned from the people, you know.

00:03:52.009 --> 00:04:01.460
So I got the things cheaper, they were very nice to preach, we had always baptisms.

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:09.060
In one year, I, I think it was thin, at least eight in one year, we started very small,

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.389
but we grew there.

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:19.110
After many years, I, I got malaria, and then they sent me to Germany, then afterwards

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:26.029
I was sent to Hungary, and I'm here now nine years, there are many Chinese, thousands

00:04:26.029 --> 00:04:28.029
of Chinese living here in Budapest.

00:04:28.029 --> 00:04:34.629
I'm reaching in Chinese shops in the restaurants, and small restaurants, and they are very

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:37.149
friendly, they know me now, many know me now.

00:04:37.149 --> 00:04:48.870
I like very much the Chinese congregation, the people come there also to meet other Chinese

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:59.610
and other Jehovah's Witnesses, and they don't want to go home, they have a good spirit.

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:06.769
I would say, I'm really thankful to Jehovah that he helped me to jump in the right moment

00:05:06.769 --> 00:05:11.850
into the right career.

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:18.209
If we are in the full time service, I think it's like you are traveling and Jehovah is directing

00:05:18.209 --> 00:05:22.689
you, so I don't worry, it's the responsibilities with Jehovah.

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:29.089
I mean, we have to be faithful, that is our responsibility, but what is happening is

00:05:29.089 --> 00:05:37.509
Jehovah knows what is, what he lets happen, it's okay, and I hope everybody who is young

00:05:37.509 --> 00:05:44.750
he will do the same, because he will miss something, because it's very satisfying and

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:52.000
working with Jehovah, you cannot compare it to anything else.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:58.680
In the 50 years since she graduated from Gilead, Sister Kuniger has learned seven languages

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:05.079
and has served in five different countries, and recently she received a new assignment,

00:06:05.079 --> 00:06:08.680
the Chinese field in Munich, Germany.

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:15.319
Daily reading and meditating on God's word the Bible has given her the strength she needs

00:06:15.319 --> 00:06:18.240
to continue with joy in her missionary assignment.
