The Kingdom Hall of Jehovah's Witnesses is now reality in this prison, the prison of

00:00:07.809 --> 00:00:13.890
Bolate. It has been up and running for around a year and a half, and a truly notable number

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:19.489
of inmates attend, who every Thursday and every Sunday freely choose to take part in

00:00:19.489 --> 00:00:25.410
the meetings. All Bible topics are discussed, and also the relationship with, with the

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.489
authorities, relationships with, that is the relationship with the outside world,

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:36.329
respect for the rules. The knowledge that so many people attend the meetings of the Kingdom Hall,

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.969
that are held in the Kingdom Hall, has convinced us that it was an excellent choice, worth

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:50.969
a while. A Kingdom Hall in other detention centres? Well, that would be a great idea.
