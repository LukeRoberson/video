WEBVTT

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:22.339
faced a period of enormous amount of transfusions

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:26.620
that actually led to complication, infectious disease,

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:27.539
and so on.

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.500
And suddenly, when the erythropoietin became available,

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.100
this changed completely our life.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.380
Together, with our specific attention

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:43.979
to blood conservation and the strategies,

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:47.020
oriented toward reduction of blood losses,

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:52.020
the so-called pillars of the patient management,

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.020
I think that we have made the blood transfusion

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:04.599
an exceptional event.

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:05.439
It takes time.

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:10.599
We have seen that the approach to sepsis, for example,

00:01:10.599 --> 00:01:13.799
in the hospital took 20 years.

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.719
Now people know that sepsis is dangerous and deadly.

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:19.239
We had the same problem with acute kidney injury.

00:01:19.239 --> 00:01:21.760
People said, oh, this is just a marginal increase

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:22.879
in serum creatinine.

00:01:22.879 --> 00:01:26.560
Today, they know that this is a deadly condition.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.159
So I think that the PBM is probably

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:33.400
become routine of care in the moment

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.200
that we start educating the new generations of physicians,

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.519
but also nurses.

00:01:38.519 --> 00:01:41.879
Also, all the people that are actually involved

00:01:41.879 --> 00:01:43.120
in the care of the patients.

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:51.260
Oh, they're very nice.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.980
We had a fantastic relationship.

00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:00.379
They are present, but not invasive.

00:02:00.379 --> 00:02:05.099
They are friends, but not inappropriate.

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:06.579
These are very good people.

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:13.780
And I think that the fact that we have been always friendly

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:19.939
and willing to share the issues and solutions and so on,

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:24.939
make them also understanding better our position.

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:28.460
So there is a fantastic dialogue that we have.

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:32.219
And I think I'm personally very happy.
