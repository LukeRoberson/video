00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.900
I grew up in this congregation, and for many years it felt like a loving family.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.899
But lately, I struggled to feel the same enthusiasm.

00:00:21.899 --> 00:00:25.899
And the elders, I struggled to understand them too.

00:00:25.899 --> 00:00:28.899
Traffic is bad after work.

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:31.899
But they probably think that I'm slacking.

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:38.340
They only notice their favorites, like Tulani.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:45.820
He's got to be the slowest brother on mics.

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.820
And this couple, every week, they are on the platform.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:01:00.250
Loving all the attention, I know this irritates his way too.

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:09.689
I don't know when I started feeling this way of my congregation.

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:15.689
But lately, I feel so disconnected from these people.

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:27.019
I have been giving Bible reading assignments since I was his age.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.500
These are still the only assignments I get.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:42.219
And with each passing month, I find myself feeling more and more unhappy in this congregation.

00:01:42.219 --> 00:02:32.169
Why then do you look at the straw in your brother's eye,

00:02:32.169 --> 00:02:36.169
but do not notice the rafter in your own eye?

00:02:36.169 --> 00:02:38.169
Or how can you say to your brother,

00:02:38.169 --> 00:02:41.169
allow me to remove the straw from your eye?

00:02:41.169 --> 00:02:46.169
When look, a rafter is in your own eye.

00:02:46.169 --> 00:02:48.169
Hypocrite.

00:02:48.169 --> 00:02:50.169
First remove the rafter from your own eye.

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:55.169
And then you will see clearly how to remove the straw from your brother's eye.

00:02:55.169 --> 00:03:09.759
I wonder, what did Jesus mean by that?

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:12.759
How could you fit a rafter in your eye?

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:15.759
And how will you see anything else?

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:24.759
How can someone with a rafter in his eye even try to remove a straw from someone else's eye?

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:27.759
Reading the Bible can be funny sometimes.

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:29.759
Jesus actually said,

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:31.759
hypocrite.

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:40.909
First remove the rafter from your own eye.

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:41.909
Hypocrite.

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:48.699
Why did Jesus call this man a hypocrite?

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:53.699
Perhaps he was so focused on the straws, the mistakes of others.

00:03:53.699 --> 00:04:01.699
He did not see the bigger mistakes, the rafter in himself.

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:03.699
Hmm.

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:06.699
But that made me think.

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:08.699
Am I a hypocrite?

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:23.439
I want to enjoy my service.

00:04:23.439 --> 00:04:29.439
I don't want to be negative or critical of my brothers.

00:04:29.439 --> 00:04:32.439
But how do I fix it?

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:34.439
I prayed.

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:38.439
I asked Jehovah to forgive me.

00:04:38.439 --> 00:05:02.620
I asked for humility too.

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:09.620
Then I went on and asked my boss if I could leave 30 minutes early so that I could do that Bible reading.

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:12.620
I was surprised when he said,

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:18.620
yes, he even suggested that I could leave early every meeting night.

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:46.000
It was like Jehovah walked into his office before I did.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
But when Brother Kumalo commanded me,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
even then I thought,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
is he being genuine?

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
That's when I realized.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
I had to continue to remove the rafter from my eye.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:06.000
I have to try to view the whole congregation the way Jehovah views them.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
I hope to enjoy the new world with them one day.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:18.779
Over the months, by becoming more helpful and less critical,

00:06:18.779 --> 00:06:22.779
I feel more connected to my congregation.

00:06:22.779 --> 00:06:28.819
Applying Bible principles helped me see the reality

00:06:28.819 --> 00:06:31.819
that it was my attitude that made me unhappy,

00:06:31.819 --> 00:06:36.779
not the mistakes of my brothers.

00:06:36.779 --> 00:06:38.779
All this time,

00:06:38.779 --> 00:06:44.779
the best way to change my congregation was to change myself.
