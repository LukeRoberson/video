00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:08.380
Let's go back to our Bibles to Hebrews chapter 13 verses 5 and 6 and see the context of today's text

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:18.379
Here in Hebrews chapter 13, it says let your way of life be free of the love of money while you are content

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.980
with the present things for he has said I

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:29.859
Will never leave you and I will never abandon you

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:38.420
So that we may be of good courage and say Jehovah is my helper. I will not be afraid. What can man do to me?

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.979
Well, those are certainly encouraging words in

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:45.899
days of economic uncertainty

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:51.100
We think about thousands of people who are left homeless as a result of

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:59.840
flooding in such lands as the United States and Texas, Louisiana, but also a Sierra Leone with massive lands

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:00.979
Slides

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:02.979
brothers in Columbia

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:10.739
And we think about millions who are still gripped by severe poverty people acting in desperation in Venezuela

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:13.980
So this is a very key promise for Jehovah's people

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:18.780
Let's take a closer look at it and how it's helping our brothers

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:25.700
When was it issued? Why was it needed? Who wrote these words? Well evidence points to the Apostle Paul and

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:31.420
From where did he write and when here look at chapter 13 verse

00:01:32.739 --> 00:01:37.260
23 and 24 I want you to know that our brother Timothy has been released

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:38.859
released

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:40.859
so Paul was in prison

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:45.099
If he comes soon, I will be with him

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:50.859
When I see you so Paul was thinking he was at the end of his own prison term and

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:57.500
And then verse 24 the latter part those in Italy send you their greetings

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.900
So for these and other reasons we conclude that Paul wrote Hebrews in

00:02:02.379 --> 00:02:07.900
61 CE right before he was released from his first imprisonment in Rome

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:14.060
How many times had Paul been in jail up to this point? Well, he recalled that he had been in jail with Silas in

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.099
Philippi

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:19.180
Back around 50 CE that would have been during his second missionary journey

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:28.300
Then around 56 he spent two years in prison in Caesarea and then he went on to have his case heard in Rome and that took

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:30.780
A boat he was shipwrecked

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.659
He went to Malta eventually got on another boat wound up in Rome where he spent another two years

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.979
Under house arrest which ended in

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:44.259
61 CE and he would have been thrown in jail one more time before he was martyred

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:47.819
Well, why mention all of that because Paul could talk from experience about

00:02:48.219 --> 00:02:54.460
Contentment he knew what it meant to follow Jehovah's direction even if it meant being low on provisions at times

00:02:54.659 --> 00:03:01.659
He knew prison food. He knew Philippi prison food. He knew Cessaria put prison food. He knew Rome prison food

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:05.099
Paul wrote to the Philippians also

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:12.860
When he was under house arrest and to the Philippians he wrote the words that we find in chapter 4 verses 11 and 12

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.060
I have learned how to be

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.539
self-sufficient regardless of my circumstances. I know how

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:28.379
To be low on provisions and how to have an abundance in everything and in all circumstances

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:30.860
I have learned the secret both

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:38.379
how to be full and how to hunger both how to have an abundance and how to do

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:42.539
Without well, there's a secret and Paul knew it

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.860
Godly contentment is a twofold a secret if we experience financial prosperity

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:57.500
We we need wisdom to know how to view that some conclude well, you know if I can afford it why not buy

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.300
But to those who know the secret the question is not always

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:06.060
Am I living within my means but rather

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.020
Is Jehovah part of my plans?

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:18.939
A Paul knew not only how to have an abundance but also how to do without how to be content with less and that means knowing how to keep

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:22.300
Natural anxiety in perspective

00:04:23.339 --> 00:04:31.819
A content person will never overreact as a result of financial loss. So back to the Hebrews. Why did the Hebrews need?

00:04:32.779 --> 00:04:35.579
This council will think of the timing 61

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.620
CE what had occurred

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:41.019
20

00:04:41.019 --> 00:04:43.019
15 years prior to this

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.579
41 to 54

00:04:46.459 --> 00:04:50.620
See the great famine the great famine mentioned in Acts chapter 11 verses

00:04:51.019 --> 00:04:59.180
That 28 and 29 a famine so severe that Christians from other parts of the world were sending relief supplies to our brothers

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:04.540
In Judea a famine that lasted for years had memories of this famine

00:05:05.339 --> 00:05:09.899
Made the brothers there in Judea the ones to whom Paul wrote the letter to the Hebrews

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:12.540
Concerned about money

00:05:13.579 --> 00:05:18.060
I might there be a lesson in that for us. Well no matter how poor we may be we should never

00:05:19.019 --> 00:05:27.100
Come to love money or become so preoccupied with money instead. We should concentrate on being rich toward Jehovah

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:31.899
Do we have any recent examples of that examples of those who are showing how they are content

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:36.139
With the present things that they know the secret of how to do without

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:40.060
Of people who are putting spiritual interest first

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:44.860
We'll consider the situation of our brothers and venezuela the international monetary fund

00:05:45.339 --> 00:05:48.060
projects that inflation will soon exceed

00:05:48.779 --> 00:05:50.300
2000 percent

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.300
In venezuela that means

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:58.139
Something that you once paid three dollars for you will soon pay sixty three dollars for

00:05:59.019 --> 00:06:05.259
A security of course is a major concern for our brothers people are acting in desperation armed gangs

00:06:05.259 --> 00:06:09.579
Will ransack any building that they think has something of value inside

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:14.540
An unexpected situation arose due to the theme of this year's convention

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:18.540
Don't give up which in spanish is no serrinda and no serrinda is the

00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:23.660
Theme that has been adopted by the opposition political party coincidentally

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:27.660
So the convention location in one of the cities

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:30.139
Had actually

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:35.100
They cancelled our contract when the administrator saw that he pre what he presumed to be

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:38.699
The opposition parties campaign slogan

00:06:39.819 --> 00:06:43.500
Well, it was only when a sister who gives private schooling

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:48.379
To the state governor's children explained our neutral stand

00:06:49.019 --> 00:06:55.259
To his wife that the misunderstanding was clarified and the convention went ahead as planned

00:06:55.899 --> 00:06:57.740
clear thinking

00:06:57.819 --> 00:06:59.740
In a time of panic

00:06:59.899 --> 00:07:05.660
In a time of economic uncertainty putting spiritual things first and all of our brothers benefited spiritually

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:13.660
From her clear thinking circuit overseers report on the the generous spirit of the congregations as the friends share what little they have

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:19.100
In spite of all the chaos the brothers are showing admirable resilience and the branch rights

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:21.660
spiritually this is a quote

00:07:22.139 --> 00:07:27.579
We have never been so prosperous meeting attendances field service activity the number of regular

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:29.339
pioneers are on the increase

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:36.620
People who have shown little interest in the past have asked to study the Bible new faces are seen at meetings assemblies and conventions

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:41.660
We hear many sincere expressions of appreciation for all the provisions to strengthen our faith

00:07:42.379 --> 00:07:45.100
The brothers are so happy to be in the truth

00:07:46.139 --> 00:07:47.339
content

00:07:47.339 --> 00:07:49.339
With the present things

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:54.459
Well, why did Paul's advice and his letter to the Hebrews prove to be timely?

00:07:55.339 --> 00:07:57.339
Think of the timing

00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:59.339
61 CE

00:07:59.339 --> 00:08:01.980
What happened in 66 CE

00:08:02.939 --> 00:08:11.420
The Roman army of Cestius Galus surrounded Jerusalem Jesus told his disciples what to watch for and what to do when it finally happened

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:20.379
Now their survival depended not on the stability of their employment nor on the value of their material possessions

00:08:21.339 --> 00:08:22.379
but on

00:08:22.379 --> 00:08:30.860
Their obedience having kept their spirituality strong having maintained a rich condition toward Jehovah

00:08:32.139 --> 00:08:34.940
The obedient ones knew exactly what to do

00:08:35.659 --> 00:08:41.019
Well, we don't know what the future will hold for us. Habakkuk chapter 3 verse 17 says the

00:08:41.419 --> 00:08:45.899
The fields may not produce food for more of us before the end comes

00:08:45.899 --> 00:08:50.059
But we can continue to see how Jehovah fulfills his promise

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:57.179
I will never leave you. I will never abandon you and when we understand that then we can truly be content

00:08:57.820 --> 00:08:59.820
With the present things
