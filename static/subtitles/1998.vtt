00:00:02.259 --> 00:00:09.919
An introduction to the book of Luke. Luke was a physician.

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:15.919
Like the Gospel writer Mark, Luke was not one of Jesus' twelve apostles.

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:21.920
Also, Luke did not refer to himself as an eyewitness of the events in Jesus' life.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:27.920
He became a disciple probably sometime after Jesus' death.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.920
In time, he traveled with the Apostle Paul.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.920
Luke's Gospel covers the time period from 3 BCE to 33 CE.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.920
He wrote and logical order often chronologically.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:48.920
Nearly 60% of the material in this book is unique in comparison with the other gospels.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.920
For example, at least six of Jesus' miracles are found exclusively in Luke's account.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:04.420
Luke uses more than 300 terms that were either used in medicine or to which he gives a medical meaning.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:11.420
Only Luke speaks of a man full of leprosy and of Peter's mother-in-law having a high fever.

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:22.569
Luke likely wrote his Gospel in Caesarea while Paul was imprisoned there, from about 56 to 58 CE.

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:29.569
So, although appearing after Mark in the Bible, Luke was the second of the four gospels to be written.

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:46.319
In addition to having access to Matthew's Gospel, Luke was no doubt moved by God's spirit to interview reliable eyewitnesses of Jesus' ministry and to examine trustworthy historical documents.

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:52.010
Luke contains twenty-four chapters.

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:59.010
Chapters 1 and 2 provide information about the early years of John the Baptist and Jesus.

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:03.010
As for told by an angel, Elizabeth gives birth to John.

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:07.010
Mary gives birth to Jesus about six months later.

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:10.860
Did you know?

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:17.860
Luke is the only gospel writer who included an account of Jesus as a 12-year-old boy.

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:25.069
Luke may have obtained this family history from Jesus' mother, Mary.

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:33.069
Chapter 3 provides material that aids in determining when John the Baptist and Jesus began their ministries.

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:43.069
Noteworthy, too, is the record of Jesus' genealogy, tracing Mary's family through King David and all the way back to Adam's son of God.

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:52.069
Chapters 4 to 9 relate the preaching and healing work of Jesus' early ministry, primarily in the region of Galilee.

00:02:52.069 --> 00:03:02.069
Luke conveys not only specific details regarding the sicknesses that Jesus healed, but also conveys the compassion with which Jesus cured people.

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:09.069
Chapter 6 describes how Jesus, after a whole night in prayer, chooses his twelve apostles.

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:16.069
In Chapter 9, Jesus sends out the twelve to preach the kingdom message and to heal the sick.

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:25.069
Chapter 10 to the middle of Chapter 19 describes events that mostly take place in Judea and Peria.

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:32.069
Jesus increases the number of kingdom proclaimers by sending out seventy more disciples to preach the message.

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:42.069
Jesus' parables of the neighborly Samaritan and the lost son, also known as the prodigal son, are mentioned only in Luke's gospel.

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:54.069
The latter part of Chapter 19 to the end of Chapter 23 records Jesus' final public ministry in and around Jerusalem and events surrounding his death.

00:03:54.069 --> 00:04:03.069
Chapter 21 includes Jesus' prophecy pertaining to the destruction of Jerusalem and to the last days of this system of things.

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:12.069
Luke adds pestilences as a feature of the last days, a detail not mentioned in the accounts of Matthew or Mark.

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:17.069
The final chapter records events relating to Jesus' resurrection.

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:25.110
Luke is the only gospel writer who describes Jesus' ascension to heaven.

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:33.110
As you read the gospel of Luke, note how Jesus zealously shared the kingdom message and trained others to do so.

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:44.110
How he described the conditions that would mark the last days and how his healing people of their afflictions shows what he will accomplish as King of God's kingdom.
