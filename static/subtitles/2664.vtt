00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:06.750
I wait until the last minute to do everything.

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.250
I know what has to be done, but I say,

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:11.250
oh, just do it after I finish six,

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.250
or just do it after I finish watching this program on TV.

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:20.719
Sometimes if I try to start early on an assignment,

00:00:20.719 --> 00:00:22.719
I don't have the motivation to get it done.

00:00:22.719 --> 00:00:26.719
I think mainly the big one for me is TV.

00:00:26.719 --> 00:00:30.719
Before you watch it, you can be watching pointless reality TV thing

00:00:30.719 --> 00:00:32.719
and it takes up so much of your time.

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:35.719
And then you think after it, you think that wasn't even very good.

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:38.719
Many people don't like to rely on a person who is a procrastinator

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:42.719
because they know that they're going to wait to the last second

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.719
to do something, and they may not even do it right.

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.719
I find that procrastinating does affect my stress levels.

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.719
I've actually got a bit of excellent from it

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:55.719
because it brings it out in my skin because I get so stressed.

00:00:55.719 --> 00:01:02.679
In the past, I've worked on assignments,

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:04.680
and I've started early on them,

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.680
and I've started late on other assignments,

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.680
and the assignments that I've spent more time

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.680
taking the time to start on it early,

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.680
I've done so much better on it.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.680
It's definitely much better to be organized, I think,

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.680
because in the long run, you get so many more things done,

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.680
and then maybe the end of the year or the end of the week

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.680
or something, you can look back and think,

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.680
I've accomplished so much.
