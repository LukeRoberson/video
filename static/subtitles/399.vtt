00:00:01.169 --> 00:00:12.169
Have you ever heard a brother pray to Jehovah, and it just sort of touches your heart and the words he uses and his mannerisms and so forth?

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:18.170
And you may say to yourself, well, I wish I could talk to Jehovah like that.

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:24.170
Well, maybe the way you talk to Jehovah is not like that.

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:29.170
You may not have all those words to use and so forth.

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:34.170
Due to a lack of education, it comes to the English language and so forth.

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:43.170
But what you do have is in your heart, and when you pour your heart out to Jehovah, he hears you.

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:51.170
And he blesses you just like he would bless the one who has all the words and the good mannerisms and so forth.

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.170
So don't worry about it. Just pray to Jehovah from your heart.

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:04.170
It's not the words that he's that interested in is what comes out of the heart.

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:10.170
So no doubt you are just as close to Jehovah as that one that you admire.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:19.170
And there's certainly nothing wrong with the marrying a brother who has that ability or sister, but don't worry about it.

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.170
That is not the main thing that Jehovah looks at.

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.170
Your approach has to come from the heart.

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:34.170
And if it does, it pleases Jehovah.

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:40.170
Notice something here in the Bible in 1 Samuel, chapter 16, verse 7.

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.170
He says, but Jehovah said to Samuel,

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:56.170
do not pay attention to his appearance or how tall he is for I have rejected him, for the way man sees is not the way God sees.

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:05.170
Because mere man sees what appears to the eyes, but Jehovah sees what is in, sees into the heart.

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.169
That's a beautiful scripture.

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:13.169
And it is one that humbles us before Jehovah.

00:02:13.169 --> 00:02:18.169
We're glad that he looks at our heart and we certainly want him to do that.

00:02:18.169 --> 00:02:21.169
I'd like to tell you about something.

00:02:21.169 --> 00:02:31.409
It had to do with a brother and older brother years ago and one of the circuits I had.

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:37.409
And we were at the dinner table. His wife was an inner truth, but she prepared a fine meal for us.

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:41.409
He was a fine brother, older in the congregation.

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:47.409
And it got to, around to what did you do before you got to truth?

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:50.409
What kind of work did you do and so forth?

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:57.819
And he said, I was a professional brother who prayed.

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:08.819
He says, the preachers in our town hired me to go to their churches on Sunday and pray.

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:23.819
He says, I had the ability to use right words and my deep voice and mannerism just calls them to reach deep into their billfuls and pocketbooks and give money.

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:29.819
So afterwards, the preachers would divvy it up and pay me off.

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:36.669
So I made quite a bit of money that way, professional prayer.

00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:46.020
Well, of course, he got the truth and he learned that that business was no good.

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:51.020
But he still could pray and reach the heart.

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.020
And that's what prayer is all about, isn't it?

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:59.020
Our text today deals with drawing close to Jehovah.

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:05.020
And one of the main ways that we draw close to Jehovah is through prayer.

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:10.020
Whether we're on our knees or standing there, lying down that matters not.

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.020
Jehovah is still here.

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:17.019
Silent prayers, he hears. We can pray as we're driving the automobile, doing anything else.

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:23.019
And he hears our prayers if they come out of the heart.

00:04:23.019 --> 00:04:27.019
And of course, we have to pray in the right way.

00:04:27.019 --> 00:04:33.019
Years ago, we had a program out in the travel work called New Things Learned.

00:04:33.019 --> 00:04:37.019
Now, we changed that later on to continue in the things learned.

00:04:37.019 --> 00:04:40.019
But at this particular time, it was New Things Learned.

00:04:40.019 --> 00:04:45.019
And I was a servant over here, so I had the program on Saturday evening.

00:04:45.019 --> 00:04:47.019
New Things Learned.

00:04:47.019 --> 00:04:52.019
One of my questions was, when you pray to Jehovah,

00:04:52.019 --> 00:05:03.019
do you go through Jesus at the beginning, or during your prayer, or at the end, or doesn't matter?

00:05:03.019 --> 00:05:06.019
Well, we've got all kinds of answers. I tell you the truth.

00:05:06.019 --> 00:05:10.019
You wouldn't believe it if you were there, all kinds of answers.

00:05:10.019 --> 00:05:14.019
So anyway, we finally gave them the correct answer and so forth.

00:05:15.019 --> 00:05:23.019
At the end of the meeting, I called on an older brother, very fine brother, in the truth, to pray.

00:05:23.019 --> 00:05:27.540
And he prayed to Jesus.

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:30.540
I said, Brother, why did you pray to Jesus?

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:38.019
He says, I didn't know who to pray to. I was so confused.

00:05:38.019 --> 00:05:44.019
So Gloria, my wife said, please don't use that on New Things Learned anymore.

00:05:44.019 --> 00:05:50.019
But that was truly a new thing learned. We just hope you unlearned congregation.

00:05:50.019 --> 00:05:54.019
Anyway, we feel that that prayer was heard by Jehovah.

00:05:54.019 --> 00:06:01.019
He takes in a consideration who we are, what we have to give, how we can do it, and so forth.

00:06:01.019 --> 00:06:09.019
But we wouldn't practice a thing like that. We wouldn't deliberately ignore Him and pray to Jesus, that's for sure.

00:06:09.019 --> 00:06:14.019
But prayer is necessary.

00:06:14.019 --> 00:06:23.019
We're really not qualified to judge whether prayers of our brothers are received favorably by Jehovah or not.

00:06:23.019 --> 00:06:32.019
Some words come from the brain and out of the mouth, while others come from the heart and out of the mouth.

00:06:32.019 --> 00:06:39.019
We ask ourselves, am I speaking to Jehovah from my heart or only from my brain?

00:06:39.019 --> 00:06:45.019
When we speak to Jehovah, we want to use truthful words that come from the heart.

00:06:45.019 --> 00:06:48.019
Words season with salt the Bible tells us.

00:06:48.019 --> 00:06:56.019
Gracious words that are in good taste, respectful and wholesome.

00:06:56.019 --> 00:07:02.019
Job's short prayer came from the heart and Job chapter 1 verse 21.

00:07:03.019 --> 00:07:07.019
Just a real short prayer. But did you overheard it?

00:07:07.019 --> 00:07:12.019
And of course, he was with Job all the way.

00:07:12.019 --> 00:07:17.019
If he hadn't been with Job, Job would have had a hard time when he was in the end.

00:07:17.019 --> 00:07:22.019
But here's his prayer. He says, naked I came out of my mother's womb and naked I will return.

00:07:22.019 --> 00:07:25.019
Job has given and Job has taken away.

00:07:25.019 --> 00:07:31.019
Let the name of Job continue to be praised.

00:07:31.019 --> 00:07:37.019
Beautiful, isn't it? Solomon also gave a beautiful prayer in 1 Kings 3, 6 through 10.

00:07:37.019 --> 00:07:39.019
We won't read that. It's lengthy.

00:07:39.019 --> 00:07:47.019
When we need help, talk to Job over from your heart, like Ace did.

00:07:48.019 --> 00:07:57.019
At the very end, when Ace asked Jehovah to help him because they had a million people against their warriors,

00:07:57.019 --> 00:08:02.019
and he had a small group, would Jehovah bless that prayer?

00:08:02.019 --> 00:08:07.019
Ace had drew close to Jehovah and Jehovah drew close to Ace.

00:08:07.019 --> 00:08:16.019
So much so that he defeated the Ethiopians before Ace and before Judah and the Ethiopians fled.

00:08:17.019 --> 00:08:21.019
Why will Ace drew close to Jehovah? That's why.

00:08:21.019 --> 00:08:26.019
And of course, we want to draw close to Jehovah.

00:08:26.019 --> 00:08:30.019
Another way that we draw close to Jehovah is through meditation.

00:08:30.019 --> 00:08:35.019
We want to think about what we pray.

00:08:35.019 --> 00:08:40.019
They say a sheep has four compartments in the stomach,

00:08:40.019 --> 00:08:44.019
so it takes a long time, sometimes two days, or longer, to digest his food.

00:08:45.019 --> 00:08:49.019
Well, some things that we take into are hard to digest.

00:08:49.019 --> 00:08:54.019
It takes a while, and we digest it basically through meditation.

00:08:54.019 --> 00:08:57.019
We have to think about it over and over again.

00:08:57.019 --> 00:09:00.019
Sometimes we even have to ask others, how do you feel about this?

00:09:00.019 --> 00:09:02.019
How did you understand it?

00:09:02.019 --> 00:09:05.019
What did it do for you and so forth?

00:09:05.019 --> 00:09:07.019
And they'll help us.

00:09:07.019 --> 00:09:13.019
So prayer and meditation, these are the two key things that we will want to think about.

00:09:13.019 --> 00:09:18.019
As we endeavor to draw close to Jehovah.
