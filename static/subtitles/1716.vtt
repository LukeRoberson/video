00:00:07.469 --> 00:00:14.550
My name is Karen Malone and I was born in Iowa but I was raised all over because my dad was in the military

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:23.269
When I think about Karen and how she came in the truth that touches my heart because she had no family in the truth and in fact

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:25.269
They didn't support her at all

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.670
Once I knew who Jehovah was I made it a goal in my life that I just wanted to serve him forever

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:45.299
And I wanted to be happy doing it. I met Karen at Bethel

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:52.060
She was special pioneering in Tennessee and I was serving at Bethel and she came through on tour

00:00:53.259 --> 00:00:58.259
A year later or so we got married and then nine months later we went back to Bethel

00:00:59.259 --> 00:01:03.780
Well in 1980 we left Bethel. We had our daughter that year

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:12.379
It changed things, but you just give your energy and your love and your time and to whatever assignment Jehovah gives us

00:01:14.489 --> 00:01:19.370
She would take the kids out with her in the field ministry during a week and she always made it fun

00:01:19.489 --> 00:01:21.489
That was one of the things

00:01:21.489 --> 00:01:31.299
That was important to her that when the kids went in the field ministry that they enjoyed it. It's just a matter of

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:34.819
Blooming where you're planted wherever you're at

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.219
We didn't ever walk into a congregation and expect people to come up to us

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:45.420
We'd be proactive in meeting people and trying to become a part of wherever we were put

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.780
So that could become our home

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:55.939
It's just loving them if they needed soup. We'd make soup if they needed a meal if they needed their house cleaned

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:00.019
If they needed a babysitter if there was a need we wanted to help them with it

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:05.900
There's so many challenges in life that try to rob us of our peace and

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.699
It's our choice if we let them

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.539
so

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:21.120
We don't let them we were invited back to bustle in 2007 and we've been there since I

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.060
Came into a beautiful department health care department

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.500
With people that were experts at it

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.620
To bloom where I was planted when I was put in front of these two computer screens took a lot of prayer

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.419
And I remember literally going to the bathroom and crying and telling Jehovah look I

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.659
Know you can part the Red Sea

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:45.780
You're gonna have to get this information from here to here because I was a blank paint and

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:47.860
Then beautiful because I

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:54.219
Too precious sisters body and Zuma that I still treasure and work with they helped me and they taught me

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:59.340
You know the expression if you can't change your circumstance change your attitude

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:02.819
So I really made it a matter of prayer and again

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:07.300
I had wonderful helpers that taught me and helped me to learn

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:14.180
When I first learned the truth I realized that there's scriptures that teaches the truth and

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:19.620
Then there's scriptures that will keep us in the truth and I call those my heart scriptures

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:25.500
And those are are my to go to scriptures when things were rough when I was dealing with things when

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.460
Something was trying to rob me in my joy. I'd refer to those heart scriptures and they would reinforce

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.300
The conviction that oh no, you're not gonna win Satan

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.340
My

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:45.740
Favorite scripture that I think epitomizes that is Proverbs 27 and 11 which we all know where it says be wise

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:51.300
My son and make my heart rejoice so that I can make a reply to him who taunts me

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:56.460
That's what it's all about is about Jehovah's name and to make a reply to the devil

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:00.060
His sovereignty is what's important. It's not about us

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:06.460
We really love being parents loved pioneering together

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:09.460
We've loved every

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:12.860
gift that we've been given I

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.019
Tell my kids each day we live as a gift from God

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:19.579
How we live it is our gift to him

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:29.259
The truth is only hard if we fight it if we listen to Jehovah if we do what we're asked the blessings will catch up with us

00:04:30.259 --> 00:04:34.620
The best day we could have here and we know we've all had wonderful days

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:39.420
Is nothing in comparison to the first day in the new world

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:48.300
It's such an amazing thought to think that all we have to do is make good choices now and we're gonna be there
