00:00:39.759 --> 00:00:57.619
My son barely escaped the gangs, again, where the only ones without a gun want to keep a gun for protection.

00:00:57.619 --> 00:01:07.939
But how else can I protect my family?

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:10.939
Hebrews chapter 11 verse 1.

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:14.939
Faith is the assured expectation of what is hope for.

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:20.939
I do have faith in God's promises, but if a gun is what I need to protect my family,

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:40.579
won't Jehovah understand?

00:01:49.579 --> 00:02:10.060
No, I couldn't do that.

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.060
I'm not the first to face a violent world.

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:21.060
Hebrews 11.5 received the witness that he had pleased God well.

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.060
Enoch lived among extreme violence, but he walked with God.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:33.699
I can imitate his faith.
