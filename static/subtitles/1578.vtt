Do not be afraid.

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.710
I will certainly show my love to you for the sake of your father, Jonathan.

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:48.280
Know what will return to you all of the land of Saul, your grandfather.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.869
And you will always die at my table.

00:00:52.869 --> 00:01:03.950

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:05.950
