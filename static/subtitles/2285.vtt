00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:12.400
I was in the military for 13 years, women didn't used to belong to combat regiments.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:18.640
I was the first to obtain the rank of sergeant in my regiment.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.399
I lived the army 24 and 7.

00:00:22.399 --> 00:00:32.399
The clothes I wore, the people I associated with, everything was military.

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:36.560
Being in a man's field is very intimidating.

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:42.159
I felt I had to work twice as hard, be twice as fast, and be twice as good.

00:00:42.159 --> 00:00:50.320
So I became more and more aggressive in order to accomplish the missions that were given to me.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:56.479
I let the pressure to perform affect me in negative ways.

00:00:56.479 --> 00:01:00.960
I did not feel anything.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:10.819
I used more profanity, I drank more heavily, I smoked more.

00:01:10.819 --> 00:01:16.030
It wasn't the quality of the life that I wanted.

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:27.579
I felt that my life wasn't going anywhere, and there was a knock on the front door.

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:33.819
It was very surprising to learn from the scriptures that I could draw close to God.

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:39.579
But the witnesses, they explained things in a way that it made sense,

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:44.530
and I could verify all of it myself.

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.969
I didn't understand what they meant by, God could love you.

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:57.489
The witnesses showed me how to look in the Bible, and find out what the Bible said about it all.

00:01:57.489 --> 00:02:05.620
It gave me a desire to keep going, and things started to get a lot better.

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:11.699
When I put down my rifle, and I picked up a Bible, those around me,

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:14.419
they didn't understand it at all.

00:02:14.419 --> 00:02:19.939
It's worth everything just to show someone that they can be loved.

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:25.060
Just to watch that change is fabulous.

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:32.259
It's only with a lot of prayer and meditation that I was able to change my personality.

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:34.819
Jehovah guides me.

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:38.979
If you put your anxiety on him,

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:44.449
he will give you that peace.

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:46.930
My husband is my joy.

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.250
He's showing me the patience and the loving kindness

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:57.840
that Jehovah wants families to experience.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.080
The members of my congregation are my family.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.240
They are my brothers and sisters.

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.080
I now have a huge worldwide family.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.319
We have a lovely, lovely congregation.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.599
And to be able to laugh and joke, and to talk about Jehovah,

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:20.530
it's wonderful.

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.530
When I was in the military,

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.770
I became a very dark and uncaring person.

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:32.610
Jehovah has taught me how to beat my sword into a plowshare.

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:37.729
He taught me that I didn't need to learn war anymore.
