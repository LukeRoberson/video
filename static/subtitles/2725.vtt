00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:07.459
I have been suffering from a very rare type of cancer since I was 8 years old.

00:00:07.459 --> 00:00:11.460
I have a tumor growing along my spine next to my heart.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.460
It causes heart problems and very violent back pains.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.460
I begged Jehovah not to fall apart.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.460
I was going to break down.

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:28.460
And before I'd even finished my prayer, I felt a veil of peace and serenity envelop me.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:34.460
Jehovah was holding my hand. I could almost feel him saying, I'm with you.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:43.460
Experiencing such extreme trials allowed me really to taste Jehovah's undeserved kindness.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.460
And that's wonderful.

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.460
There are a lot of things I'd like to do, but I am unable to because of my sickness.

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:57.380
I've had many feelings since my childhood.

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.380
Frustration, anger, even denial.

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.379
But Jehovah really helped me accept my situation.

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:13.579
My parents always taught me to cherish my relationship with Jehovah.

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:18.579
Today, I just need to know that Jehovah loves me.

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:23.579
When I don't feel well, I pray to him very intensely for very precise things.

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:26.579
Each time he answers my prayer.
