00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:05.190
Okay, let's practice vowels.

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:06.950
Do you remember the vowels?

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:08.750
Should I write them down?

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:09.789
Yeah.

00:00:09.789 --> 00:00:13.150
My mother was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease.

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:20.050
I provide for her economically, and I'm her caregiver.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.870
This involves preparing her meals,

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:29.109
making sure she takes her medication,

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:35.880
and making conversation so she keeps her mind active.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.579
All of it can be very overwhelming.

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.979
My daughter was born premature at six months.

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:47.740
The areas of the brain that allow her to walk

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:53.979
and to speak well, the motor areas were damaged.

00:00:53.979 --> 00:01:01.200
When my wife passed away, it was even harder for me.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.640
Not a lot of people know all the work that's involved.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.159
It takes me around two to three hours for us

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.299
to get ready for the meetings or the ministry.

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.140
Looking after someone 24-7 is extremely

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.219
exhausting for the caregiver.

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:19.939
On some days I go to bed, and even though I'm exhausted,

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:22.579
I can't fall asleep, so it can be very easy

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:25.420
for frustration to build up.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.060
And then you just snap.

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.260
Then you judge yourself really harshly for it after.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.420
And you think, I'm awful.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.189
I'm an awful person.

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.590
I've learned that being a caregiver also means

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.340
taking care of yourself first, because you need to be

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.430
in a good place, both spiritually and physically.

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.430
I try to go for walks so that I can have

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.469
a little bit more strength.

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:58.189
To take care of my relationship with Jehovah,

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:01.430
my personal study is very important.

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.510
I usually do it at night when everything's calm in the house,

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:10.099
and it's not necessary for me to be by her side.

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:13.219
As caregivers, we need to take care of our health.

00:02:13.219 --> 00:02:17.060
So what I try to do is have a specific bedtime

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.659
and put aside my electronic devices at a certain time.

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:23.580
It's the simple things that sometimes you forget to do.

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:29.180
And as a caregiver, you tend to put yourself last.

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.300
So when I'm tired out, I ask my sister

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.500
to help me take care of my mom.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:39.979
And then I try to do something to enjoy myself.

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:43.419
If I'm able to take care of my mom's needs by myself

00:02:43.419 --> 00:02:47.219
with what I've got, then that's what I do.

00:02:47.219 --> 00:02:49.900
But if my close family can't provide the additional help

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.740
that we need, it's really important for me

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:56.099
as a caregiver to be able to say, I'm tired.

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:57.699
I need help.

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.939
I used to feel too embarrassed to ask for help.

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:05.539
But then I realized that was actually preventing blessings

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:08.139
that Jehovah wanted to give us.

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:10.620
For example, the other day, we were writing letters

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.300
and I could see the love that the brothers and sisters

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.500
have for my daughter.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.180
When we go out and service, sometimes they say,

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.580
take a break, Damien.

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.539
We'll take her today.

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:24.500
I feel comforted when the brothers and sisters

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.780
are so interested in us.

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:29.099
Recently, a sister came by the house.

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:31.219
I invited her to come in and she said,

00:03:31.219 --> 00:03:32.860
no, I'm just stopping by.

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.139
I was thinking of you both and I wanted to bring you this.

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:37.900
It was a bag with some bread.

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.379
You'd think it's just bread.

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:44.620
No, it's not just bread.

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.259
It's a sister's time, her money.

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:52.419
But mostly, it's her interest, her love.

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:55.340
For me, the benefit of having a close friend

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.460
is being able to say to them, hey, this is how I feel.

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:01.139
I want to cry.

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:02.659
I want to run.

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:06.819
Sometimes my thoughts can overwhelm me.

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:11.979
Second Corinthians, one, three and four, says,

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:15.900
praise be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.699
the Father of tender mercies, and the God of all comfort.

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:23.500
Who comforts us in all our trials

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:29.339
so that we may be able to comfort others in any sort of trial

00:04:29.339 --> 00:04:32.660
with the comfort that we receive from God?

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:36.220
Jehovah comforts me, whether it's through the Scriptures

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.420
or through the congregation.

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:43.379
And I can then offer that comfort to my daughter.

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:47.379
If my wife were here, we'd share this burden together.

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:53.769
But now I realize that I do share the burden with Jehovah.

00:04:53.769 --> 00:04:57.009
This is how Jehovah has helped me to find balance

00:04:57.009 --> 00:05:00.649
and to be able to take care of us both.

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:05.089
Time and time again when we face difficult situations.

00:05:05.089 --> 00:05:10.370
The only one who really knows what's in my heart is Jehovah.

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:13.370
And every single time without fail,

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:15.089
he provides a solution.
