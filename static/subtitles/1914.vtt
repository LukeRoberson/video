WEBVTT

00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:08.380
Welcome, dear brothers and sisters, to our update.

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:15.779
We'd like to begin with a brief report about some of the disasters that have continued

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:19.579
to affect our brothers recently.

00:00:19.579 --> 00:00:28.579
In September, our brothers in Greece faced heavy rain and severe flooding.

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:37.740
On October, our brothers in Mexico dealt with a category 5 hurricane, which caused widespread

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.539
damage.

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:48.859
And in November, our brothers in the Philippines experienced a magnitude 6.7 earthquake.

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:56.020
Sadly, as a result of the earthquake, one of our dear sisters died.

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:01.020
And 10 brothers and sisters were injured.

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:10.219
We continued to pray for those affected by the many disasters happening around the world.

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:16.219
But we thank all of you for your support and prayers.

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:20.780
Some of you are working hard with disaster relief.

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:28.859
Many more of you are making generous donations, which allow us to provide the necessities for

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:35.980
our brothers and sisters and to rebuild their homes and kingdom halls.

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.939
We're so grateful for your help.

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:46.519
On behalf of the governing body, we say, thank you.

00:01:46.519 --> 00:01:52.120
But now for the rest of our update, let's discuss the theme.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.799
We recommend ourselves as God's ministers.

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:03.599
This is based on 2 Corinthians chapter 6, verse 4, where the Apostle Paul said, in every

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:11.199
way, we recommend ourselves as God's ministers.

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:13.520
What does that mean?

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:21.240
The study note in this verse says, the Greek verb rendered we recommend ourselves conveys

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:28.719
the idea we prove or show ourselves to be.

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:35.520
But how do we show ourselves to be ministers of the true God?

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:41.000
One important way is by our appearance.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:48.039
We all want to reflect well on the God we love and worship.

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:49.800
How do we do that?

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:57.860
By following Bible principles, for example, consider the principle recorded at 1 Timothy

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.400
chapter 2 verses 9 and 10.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:13.039
Likewise, the women should adorn themselves in appropriate dress with modesty and soundness

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:21.879
of mind, not with styles of hairbrading and gold or pearls or very expensive clothing.

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:34.960
But in a way that is proper for women professing devotion to God, namely through good works.

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:43.479
Although that counsel is directed to Christian women, the principle applies equally to men

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:46.080
and women.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:55.719
The only way all of us can recommend ourselves as God's ministers is by making sure that

00:03:55.719 --> 00:04:05.560
our appearance is appropriate and modest reflecting soundness of mind.

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:11.960
But does that mean that all of Jehovah's Witnesses make the same choices?

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:15.759
Should we wear a uniform?

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:21.839
Or adopt a single form of appropriate dress and grooming?

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:23.920
Of course not.

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:34.000
There well over 8 million of Jehovah's Witnesses worldwide and we have a wide range of cultures.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:43.600
Jehovah has drawn these millions of people and he loves variety.

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:50.040
But now we ask, what about the wearing of a beard?

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:54.600
Is that an appropriate choice for a brother to make?

00:04:54.600 --> 00:05:02.920
To help us answer that question, let's watch the following video which reviews the history

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:11.300
of beards among Jehovah's people.

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:16.939
In patriarchal times, it was customary for men to wear beards.

00:05:16.939 --> 00:05:20.100
This practice continued among the Israelites.

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:26.579
An Israelite man would shave only when he was humiliated or grieving.

00:05:26.579 --> 00:05:32.740
For example, when the King of Ammon humiliated David's servants by shaving their beards,

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:38.860
David protected their dignity by telling them, stay in Jericho until your beards grow back

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.339
and then return.

00:05:41.339 --> 00:05:47.660
These later, the prophet Ezekiel shaved his beard and his head to symbolize the great distress

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:51.579
and grief that would soon afflict Jerusalem.

00:05:51.579 --> 00:05:52.579
What about Jesus?

00:05:52.579 --> 00:05:56.540
Did he too, as an Israelite, wear a beard?

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:02.220
For some years, based on the conclusions of certain archaeologists, our publications most

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:06.060
often portrayed Jesus as clean shaven.

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:14.019
In 1968, the watchtower considered more reliable evidence from both historical sources and

00:06:14.019 --> 00:06:15.660
the scriptures.

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:21.620
None of the four gospels indicate that Jesus' appearance stood out as different.

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:25.980
He did what was customary among Jewish men at that time.

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:28.699
He wore a beard.

00:06:28.699 --> 00:06:34.740
Our videos and artwork in our publications ever since have consistently portrayed Jesus

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:38.459
with a well-gruned beard.

00:06:38.459 --> 00:06:43.379
By the time the Christian congregation was established, the Romans had adopted the practice

00:06:43.379 --> 00:06:45.180
of shaving.

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:50.860
Were Jewish Christians then expected to shave, or were Gentile Christians expected to grow

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:54.860
beards in order to blend in with their Jewish brothers?

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:56.459
Evidently not.

00:06:56.459 --> 00:07:03.220
Since the scriptures neither command true worshipers to grow a beard, nor command them to shave,

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:06.939
this was a matter of personal decision.

00:07:06.939 --> 00:07:13.699
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, beards were common even among the Bible students,

00:07:13.699 --> 00:07:19.860
as seen in these photos of pilgrim brothers who traveled for the organization.

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:22.420
Brother Russell II wore a beard.

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:27.019
One newspaper editor called him a well-gruned minister.

00:07:27.019 --> 00:07:28.019
He said,

00:07:28.019 --> 00:07:33.060
It had never occurred to me he was any different from thousands of other preachers.

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:38.180
His soft white-flowing beard is the beard of a patriarch, a father.

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:40.779
It gives you confidence.

00:07:40.779 --> 00:07:46.300
Soon after World War I, shaving enjoyed a resurgence in popularity.

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:52.139
In 1919, when this photo of the pilgrims was taken, most did not have a beard.

00:07:52.139 --> 00:07:57.180
Therefore, although our publications said little about the subject at the time, very few

00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:59.860
brothers grew beards.

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:05.519
Starting in the 1960s, in many lands, beards became associated with those who were rebelling

00:08:05.519 --> 00:08:08.060
against established authority.

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:14.660
Where that was the case, most men, both witnesses and non-witnesses, chose to shave.

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:19.660
Because of the negative connotations associated with wearing a beard, most brothers who wore

00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:26.500
a beard did not serve as ministerial servants, elders, or in other appointed positions.

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:31.740
With the passing of time, in some lands, beards became more common and were not associated

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:33.259
with rebellion.

00:08:33.259 --> 00:08:39.940
In those places, some brothers with beards were appointed as ministerial servants and elders.

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:46.220
In recent times, the wearing of a beard has become common in many more lands.

00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:54.980
So how should we view a brother who chooses to grow a beard today?

00:08:54.980 --> 00:09:00.539
The video ended with an intriguing question.

00:09:00.539 --> 00:09:07.299
How should we view a brother who chooses to grow a beard today?

00:09:07.299 --> 00:09:13.980
The governing body has asked me to read the following announcement.

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:20.740
A number of branch offices around the world have written to us, indicating that there

00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:28.100
continue to be questions about whether or not it is proper for a brother in an appointed

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:31.899
position to wear a beard.

00:09:31.899 --> 00:09:38.899
After prayerful consideration, the governing body has concluded that there is an need to

00:09:38.899 --> 00:09:42.500
clarify this matter.

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:48.379
The governing body does not have an issue with brothers wearing beards.

00:09:49.019 --> 00:09:51.139
Why not?

00:09:51.139 --> 00:09:56.820
Because the scriptures do not condemn the wearing of beards.

00:09:56.820 --> 00:10:05.820
Furthermore, as time has passed, we have noted that in many lands it is acceptable for men

00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:13.500
who hold responsible positions in business and government to wear beards.

00:10:13.539 --> 00:10:21.340
Thus, whether a brother wears a beard is a personal decision.

00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:29.340
A brother's qualifications deserve as an elder or ministerial servant or based on his

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:36.059
spirituality, not on whether he chooses to wear a beard.

00:10:36.059 --> 00:10:43.539
This direction also applies to special full-time servants at Bethel, and those in the field

00:10:43.539 --> 00:10:51.059
including special pioneers, missionaries, and circuit overseers.

00:10:51.059 --> 00:11:00.340
In harmony with Romans 144, neither the elders nor any other Christian should feel compelled

00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:06.059
to judge a brother who chooses to wear a beard.

00:11:06.059 --> 00:11:13.340
We trust that these comments will help us to remain on guard against anything that might

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:24.299
cause division among Jehovah's people, end of the announcement from the governing body.

00:11:24.299 --> 00:11:30.179
This direction, however, may raise some questions.

00:11:30.179 --> 00:11:32.580
For example, here's one.

00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:38.019
Why is the governing body providing this direction at this time?

00:11:38.019 --> 00:11:45.379
Well, as recorded at 1 Corinthians 7.31, the Apostle Paul was inspired to write,

00:11:45.379 --> 00:11:50.980
the scene of this world is changing.

00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:56.740
The study note in that verse shows that Paul may have been alluding to the way that

00:11:56.740 --> 00:12:08.820
scenes change swiftly in a theater, with actors passing quickly on and off the stage.

00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:16.059
In keeping with the principle of Paul's inspired statement, grooming styles have changed

00:12:16.059 --> 00:12:17.820
over the years.

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:26.059
For example, more and more beards are worn by men in responsible positions who project

00:12:26.059 --> 00:12:30.379
a respectable appearance.

00:12:30.379 --> 00:12:32.820
Here's another question.

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:38.620
How should we view a brother who decides to grow a beard?

00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:51.539
Well, we should apply Jesus' counsel, founded John 724, stop judging by the outward appearance.

00:12:51.539 --> 00:12:58.460
As we saw in the video, grooming styles have changed over time.

00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:01.779
Not all of such changes are bad.

00:13:01.779 --> 00:13:07.659
To illustrate, none of us would likely choose to dress and groom ourselves as people did

00:13:07.659 --> 00:13:14.860
in Bible times, nor even as people did a century ago.

00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:24.460
In fact, most choose to follow the styles that are prevalent now, not those from decades

00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:26.580
past.

00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:32.659
Generally speaking, it's not bad or wrong to dress and groom ourselves as people in our

00:13:32.659 --> 00:13:35.659
community commonly do.

00:13:35.659 --> 00:13:44.019
As long as that style does not violate Bible principles.

00:13:44.019 --> 00:13:54.139
We always want to be sure that our appearance reflects cleanliness, modesty, and soundness

00:13:54.139 --> 00:13:56.460
of mind.

00:13:56.460 --> 00:13:58.740
Here's another question.

00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:05.620
How can we promote unity in light of this direction?

00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:14.539
After viewing this program, some might have to contend with strong feelings.

00:14:14.539 --> 00:14:22.940
For example, some might feel as though they've been vindicated, saying in effect, this

00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:28.059
is what I've been saying for a long time.

00:14:28.059 --> 00:14:35.500
This proves that I was right all along.

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:43.740
Others might feel disappointed, saying in effect, I supported the policy about grooming

00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:45.779
for all those years.

00:14:45.779 --> 00:14:50.379
Now, I'll feel that down.

00:14:50.379 --> 00:14:54.059
But is either reaction appropriate?

00:14:54.059 --> 00:14:55.980
Not really.

00:14:55.980 --> 00:15:03.820
Not what the Apostle Paul was inspired to write at 1 Corinthians chapter 1 and verse

00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:06.620
number 10.

00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:13.779
Now I urge you, brothers, through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you should all

00:15:13.779 --> 00:15:23.100
speak in agreement and that there should be no divisions among you, but that you may

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:32.820
be completely united in the same mind and in the same line of thought.

00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:35.980
How does that principle apply here?

00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:46.820
Well, if we've been promoting our own opinion on this subject, contradicting the guidance

00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:52.820
from the organization, have we been promoting unity?

00:15:52.820 --> 00:16:00.379
Have we up the Brotherhood to be completely united in the same line of thought?

00:16:00.379 --> 00:16:02.659
Clearly not.

00:16:02.659 --> 00:16:09.899
Any who've done so need to adjust their thinking and attitude.

00:16:09.899 --> 00:16:18.019
On the other hand, if we've loyally supported the organization's direction over the years,

00:16:18.019 --> 00:16:23.659
do we have any scriptural reason to regret our course?

00:16:23.659 --> 00:16:25.379
Certainly not.

00:16:25.379 --> 00:16:29.700
Jehovah values our loyal service.

00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:37.059
He also appreciates our humble willingness to be obedient and submissive to the direction

00:16:37.059 --> 00:16:42.299
we receive from God's organization.

00:16:42.299 --> 00:16:51.100
Back in the first century CE, some Christians allowed the issue of circumcision to cause

00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:59.899
division, but the Holy Spirit directed the governing body to resolve that issue and

00:16:59.899 --> 00:17:01.779
promote unity.

00:17:01.779 --> 00:17:08.819
Similarly, the governing body today is striving to promote unity.

00:17:08.819 --> 00:17:18.259
We would never want the matter of beards to cause division among us.

00:17:18.259 --> 00:17:23.819
All of us need to remember that the earthly part of Jehovah's organization is always

00:17:23.819 --> 00:17:32.099
striving to reflect the heavenly part, to keep up with it as it were.

00:17:32.099 --> 00:17:42.019
Remember how fast the chariot and Ezekiel's vision moved like flashes of lightning?

00:17:42.019 --> 00:17:52.019
Any who seek to run ahead of that chariot, trying to force change prematurely, or who lag

00:17:52.019 --> 00:18:00.740
behind, hesitating to support changes that have come from the fateful slave, are not keeping

00:18:00.819 --> 00:18:06.630
pace with Jehovah's organization.

00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:15.710
In conclusion, are we not grateful for this balanced erection regarding beards?

00:18:15.710 --> 00:18:18.509
Jehovah has dignified us.

00:18:18.509 --> 00:18:27.109
He allows each brother the freedom to choose whether or not he will wear a beard.

00:18:27.109 --> 00:18:35.950
Consider confident that all of you are determined to keep pace, adjust your views as needed,

00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:48.750
and continue to serve Jehovah loyally, promoting love and unity among your brothers and sisters.

00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:56.750
From the world headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses, this is JW Broadcasting.
