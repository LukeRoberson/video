00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:16.359
People often tell me why I never talked to a person that it was 107 years old and I tell them, you know what, I never did either.

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:26.660
I would describe Alma as probably the most energetic, hundred-plus-year-old lady that I've ever met.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.660
She has pretty much the whole seeocratic history in her mind that she carries with her.

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:37.659
So you can ask her anything about the organization and she can be able to tell you about it because she's even met a lot of those people.

00:00:37.659 --> 00:00:45.659
We read about it, but she lived it. She's amazing. Even though she's 107, she has an incredible memory.

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:56.659
I go back quite a ways. When I was very young, 10 years old, we saw the full drama of creation.

00:00:56.659 --> 00:01:04.980
And it was just packed with people. They were even standing in the back.

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:12.980
We were so thrilled, we never forgot it. And we realized that we found the truth.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:19.980
My father left the church and he became one of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:23.980
And he were called Bible students at that time.

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:34.980
In the early days, we went to special conventions. In some places, they had a big field where they put the cars and they set up their tents.

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:42.510
They even named different streets. It was just like a little city.

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:50.510
I was really thrilled to see Brother Brotherhood speak as the conventions I attended.

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:58.510
I got married to Harold Miller in 1931. That was when the depression was going on.

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:09.509
And times were very difficult. Everything was scarce. There were no jobs to be had. The food was rationed.

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:20.509
People were really hungry. And they moved in any little shack that they could. Just to get by.

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:32.509
We didn't have anything. And we couldn't drive the car. So we used to have a little white horse. The name was Lou.

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:44.240
And we went out with this thing with the horse and buggy. She took us all over the place. Far distances.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:52.240
They would take this buggy and they would go 20-30 miles, one direction, 20-30 miles the other direction.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:57.240
All the hard work that they put forth has resulted in several congregations in the area.

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:06.580
We used to carry that magazine bag. We were witnessing for a while there.

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:13.580
And so we put it around the horse's neck. And so the horse was taking part in our witnessing.

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:20.580
People knew who was coming when they saw the little white horse come into their yard.

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:32.580
Sometimes it was cold. I remember wearing two coats. Yeah, it's tiresome. But we were young.

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:37.580
They would just go out regardless of rain or shine or whatever was going on at the time. And when they didn't have a car.

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:43.580
And to me that's amazing because we get you so used to the convenience as I guess you could call it. The coffee breaks the cars and everything.

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:48.580
It's like, well, if Alma can do it, surely I can do it.

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:54.580
One time Harold went out witnessing in the 50 years later he talked to the same man.

00:03:54.580 --> 00:04:06.580
He said, 50 years ago there was a young guy who came through here writing on horseback and telling people that he said,

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:17.579
I think it's Armageddon. He said was coming soon. And he remembered Harold writing horse back 50 years ago in that territory.

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:27.579
And he got there again. And that happened a couple times more. So it was a long life I would to see.

00:04:27.579 --> 00:04:40.990
Alma is so zealous for the ministry. She does not like not at homes. She wants to talk to people.

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:53.990
Yeah, I enjoy the ministry. I go as much as I can in my old age. We want to help the people to see the truth. There's no greater joy.

00:04:53.990 --> 00:05:12.649
I try to read the publications so I have a reading machine. The letters come right on the screen. And I can study Alma lessons.

00:05:12.649 --> 00:05:21.250
I would be lost without it. It helps me to keep up in present truth.

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:27.250
What does dedication mean? Sister Miller, please.

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:34.250
Dedication means. Some young ones might be concerned about what they should do with their life or choices they should make.

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:41.250
Well, here we see an example of somebody who served Jehovah for over a hundred years. And we see that she's happy and has no regrets of their life.

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:45.620
And that's an example that we want to imitate.

00:05:45.620 --> 00:06:01.319
Well, giving my life to Jehovah, that's the best thing I could do for myself. If I have any advice for young ones today, I would say to keep on the truth.

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:10.319
They have a whole world before them to serve Jehovah. Something that endures forever.
