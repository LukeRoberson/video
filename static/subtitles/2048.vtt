00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:15.259
Each artist's work is a reflection of the individual.

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:22.359
Personal expression of creative skill and imagination.

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:26.359
But are such expressions limited to human works of art?

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:29.359
Or are they also displayed in the natural world?

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:38.229
We live in a world rich and spectacular colors.

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:43.229
Everywhere we look, different shades and hues captivate our eyes.

00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:49.409
Some are subtle variations.

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:54.229
Others are sharp contrasts.

00:00:54.229 --> 00:01:00.229
Together, they draw our attention to the striking beauty that exists all around us in creation.

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:06.150
But where do all these colors come from?

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:13.150
The answer has to do with the nature of light and how it interacts with different surfaces.

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:20.060
Light usually appears white to our eyes.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:26.060
However, white light can actually be separated into all the different colors of the visible spectrum.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.310
Each color corresponding to a different wavelength.

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:39.310
Most objects contain chemical substances called pigments that absorb certain wavelengths and reflect others.

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:48.870
What is reflected back to the eye by each object appears as the wonderful variety of colors that we see.

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:57.870
However, among the most exquisite colors displayed in nature are those that come from a phenomenon known as iridescence.

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:01.870
These brilliant colors can vary depending on the angle of your view.

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:06.219
How are these shimmering colors produced?

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:12.460
In most cases, iridescence is caused not by chemical pigments,

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:17.460
but by precise structural patterns within the surface of an object.

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:25.460
For example, the wings of morpho butterflies are covered in tiny, semi-transparent scales.

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:31.460
On each scale, we find layers of microscopic, evenly spaced ridges,

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:35.460
which in turn have still smaller ridges on their sides.

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:43.460
The distance between these tiny ridges is actually smaller than a wavelength of light.

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:48.460
They break up the light waves and create an interference pattern.

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:55.460
As a result, some colors are canceled out, and others are intensified.

00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:02.460
These intensified light waves are reflected back to our eyes as a dazzling blue.

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:12.060
Yes, these brilliant works of art are the result of ingenious and intricate design.

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:18.060
Spectacular colors can be found not only in objects around us, but above us as well.

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:27.939
As the sun goes down, magnificent sunsets paint the sky with breathtaking colors.

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:33.699
What is behind this artistry in the sky?

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:41.699
As sunlight travels to the earth, the light strikes air molecules and dust particles and is diffused or scattered.

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:47.699
The extent to which a light wave is scattered, however, depends on its wavelength.

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:53.699
Blue light waves have a shorter wavelength and are widely scattered throughout the atmosphere.

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:59.699
That's why we see a blue sky when the sun is well above the horizon on a clear day.

00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:06.699
However, when the sun is near the horizon, the light must travel through more of the atmosphere to reach our eyes.

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:12.699
Blue light, with its shorter wavelength, is scattered before it ever reaches us.

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:18.699
On the other hand, the longer red and orange light waves can travel farther through the atmosphere

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:27.410
and adorn the sky with the golden and crimson colors of the sunset.

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:34.579
What a rich diversity of colors have been used to paint our earthly home.

00:04:34.579 --> 00:04:41.579
When we take time to observe their beauty, we are drawn closer to Jehovah God, the greatest artist.

00:04:41.579 --> 00:04:48.149
For just as each artist's work is a reflection of the individual.

00:04:48.149 --> 00:04:56.149
So too, the beautiful colors Jehovah has chosen for each of his creations are daily reminders of his deep love for us.

00:04:56.149 --> 00:05:03.709
Yes, everything he has made pretty in its time.
