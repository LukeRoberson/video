00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.219
and introduction to first Corinthians.

00:00:05.219 --> 00:00:13.470
The Apostle Paul wrote this letter to the Christians living in the busy Cosmopolitan city of Corinth.

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:22.350
Paul stayed in Corinth during his second missionary journey and helped establish a congregation there.

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:28.850
During his third missionary journey, evidently while in Ephesus,

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:34.850
Paul received a letter as well as disturbing reports about the congregation in Corinth.

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:42.700
It was about 55 CE when Paul wrote to the Corinthians to address these matters.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:49.039
First Corinthians contains 16 chapters.

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:57.039
In chapters 1 to 4, Paul corrects the Corinthians divisive thinking and exhorts them to be united.

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:06.379
Paul reasons that it is unimportant who plants or who waters because God makes things grow.

00:01:06.379 --> 00:01:13.379
In chapters 5 and 6, Paul addresses the serious matter of sexual immorality.

00:01:13.379 --> 00:01:17.379
There is an unrepentant wrongdoer among them.

00:01:17.379 --> 00:01:21.379
This man must be removed to protect the congregation.

00:01:21.379 --> 00:01:26.379
The congregation is urged to flee from sexual immorality.

00:01:26.379 --> 00:01:35.620
Chapter 7 provides balanced counsel regarding both singleness and marriage.

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:42.620
In chapters 8 to 10, we learn that sometimes we should lovingly refrain from doing what we may have a right to do

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:47.620
so that we do not stumble others or hinder people from accepting the good news.

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:56.430
Did you know The Ismian Games were held every two years near Corinth.

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:07.430
Drawing on this familiar situation, Paul used the illustration of running a race to help the congregation in Corinth to understand the need for faithfulness and endurance.

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:16.900
In chapter 11, Paul gives direction concerning the Lord's evening meal.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:23.900
In chapter 12, Paul likens the congregation to the human body to show that each member is important.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:30.719
Jehovah is pleased when we cooperate with one another unitedly.

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:38.409
Chapter 13 describes how love acts and how it does not act.

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:44.409
Chapter 14 explains that congregation meetings should be orderly and harmonious.

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:52.169
In chapter 15, we find confirmation that the resurrection hope is certain.

00:02:52.169 --> 00:02:58.169
Paul refers to fulfilled prophecy as well as eyewitness accounts of Jesus' resurrection.

00:02:58.169 --> 00:03:06.699
He explains that victory over sin and death comes through the ransom sacrifice of Jesus Christ.

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:13.699
In chapter 16, Paul gives direction regarding the collection for the impoverished Christians in Jerusalem.

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:22.199
As you read verse Corinthians, note how true Christians should remain united.

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:33.199
How the congregation should uphold Jehovah's moral standards, and how belief in the resurrection of Jesus is fundamental to our receiving kingdom blessings.
