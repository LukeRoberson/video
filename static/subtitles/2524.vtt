00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.549
I just cleaned the house, so remember, take your shoes off.

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:51.950
Okay, mom.

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:12.169
Mommy tell you to take off your shoes.

00:02:12.169 --> 00:02:15.219
Yes.

00:02:15.219 --> 00:02:18.219
Mom worked very hard to clean the house today.

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:31.969
How will she feel when she sees this?

00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:33.969
I know, I know.

00:02:34.469 --> 00:02:36.469
Let's clean this up together.

00:02:36.469 --> 00:02:45.550
So that was a lot of work, right?

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:48.050
You know, if you had listened to mommy,

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:52.050
you wouldn't have had to do all that work.

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.050
My son, when we tell you to do something,

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.050
it's because we love you.

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.050
We want the best for you.

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:03.050
Remember what we're learning family worship?

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:06.050
It is here in Ephesians.

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:08.050
What chapter is that?

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:09.050
Six.

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.050
Right, very good.

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.050
This is what Jehovah wants you to do.

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:18.050
Children, that's your Caleb.

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:21.050
Be obedient to your parents

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:25.050
that it may go well with you.

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:35.319
That's why you should always listen to mommy daddy.

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:37.319
Come on, let's go get some food.

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:39.319
Okay, dad.

00:03:39.319 --> 00:04:08.229
Caleb, it is time for family worship.

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:12.229
Get your book and pick up all these marbles.

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:33.879
Someone could get hurt.

00:04:33.879 --> 00:05:06.800
Always listen to mommy daddy.

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:40.810
I'm so proud of you for obeying.

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:41.810
Now, let's hurry up.

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:43.810
Your sister and dad are waiting for us.

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:47.810
What do you see in this picture?

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:51.810
Oh, good, now everybody's here.

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:54.810
Let's say a prayer to begin family worship.
