00:00:01.389 --> 00:00:08.830
This month, I'd like to talk to you on the subject, Jehovah loves you, despite appearances,

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:11.630
our imperfections.

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:20.910
You likely notice there are two areas we'll discuss, our appearance and our imperfections.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.629
Why address these two aspects?

00:00:24.629 --> 00:00:30.309
It's because there's a percentage of Jehovah's faithful servants that wonder if Jehovah

00:00:30.309 --> 00:00:39.310
can really love them because of one of those two reasons, or both.

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:41.310
Let's take appearances first.

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:47.310
When you've gotten all cleaned up and are fully dressed each day and you're glassed

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:54.149
of full-length mirror, are you pleased with the way you look?

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.630
Would you like to change a few things, but you can't?

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:06.629
Some of us tend to compare ourselves to other imperfect humans and adopt the thinking

00:01:06.629 --> 00:01:09.269
of the masses.

00:01:09.269 --> 00:01:16.870
Movies and television have blinded many to reality, making them feel that the beauty of

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:25.950
the human body must look like the handsome and beautiful movie stars and famed athletes.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:35.069
However, comparing ourselves to them can often be very disappointing, time-consuming,

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:37.510
and even expensive.

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:45.510
If you go to great lengths to try to look more like another person, it's true.

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:50.989
Some have been born with a physical impairment or disability.

00:01:50.989 --> 00:01:53.629
This may be obvious to others.

00:01:53.629 --> 00:02:00.189
And some unkind people might have made comments or teased the person.

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:08.030
That can make a person feel self-conscious or even create a feeling of low self-esteem.

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:16.069
This can become slow and ingrained in one's thinking that he might begin to feel no one

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.069
could love him.

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:26.830
And at times, that kind of erroneous thinking can even affect a person's view of Jehovah's

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.830
love.

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:38.550
However, please be assured that Jehovah loves us despite our physical appearance.

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:44.310
It's been said, beauty is only skin deep.

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.669
It fades with time.

00:02:47.669 --> 00:02:53.189
Let's look at a picture of yourself when you were, let's say, 17.

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:57.150
And then look at one when you are in your 80s.

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:03.229
You say, that's not me, oh yes it is.

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:07.590
Humans are sometimes enamored by appearances.

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:16.000
We don't mean to do this, but we may get caught up in this trap, a faithful prophet of Jehovah

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
fell into this type of reasoning.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.639
Do you remember when Jehovah told Samuel to anoint the next king of Israel?

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:33.280
At first Samuel, chapter 16, verse 3, Jehovah told Samuel to go to Jesse in the Bethlehem

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:43.159
and there he said, you must anoint for me the one whom I designate to you.

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:47.360
Do you have that in your mind?

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:54.280
No, you must anoint the one whom I designate to you.

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.639
What happened?

00:03:56.639 --> 00:04:03.759
Samuel defaulted to the way human sometimes a few others or appearances.

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:05.759
Let's read what happened.

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:10.800
It's recorded at first Samuel chapter 16, verse 6.

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:17.319
It reads, as they came in and he saw Eliad, he said,

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:24.000
surely here before Jehovah stands his anointed one.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:31.879
Samuel didn't really know Eliad, but he was impressed with his appearance.

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:39.089
He was tall and likely a good looking man.

00:04:39.089 --> 00:04:44.120
Read along with me on the screen, verse 7.

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:49.920
Jehovah's wave assessing our worth before him is very different.

00:04:49.959 --> 00:04:58.800
Verse 7 says, but Jehovah said to Samuel, do not pay attention to his appearance

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:04.600
and how tall he is for I have rejected him.

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:11.600
Now note this, for the way man sees is not the way God sees,

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:15.920
because mere man sees what appears to the eyes,

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:20.199
but Jehovah sees into the heart.

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:24.000
Jehovah's view of beauty is different from ours.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.160
Close your little eyes for a minute and see what your mind's eye,

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:33.610
a beautiful bird, now open your eyes.

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:35.970
Which bird did you see?

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:43.250
Was it an indigo, bunting, a cardinal, or a Baltimore Oreo?

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:46.529
Those are beautiful birds.

00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:56.930
But does Jehovah prefer one bird over another just because of his beauty or appearance?

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:04.769
What bird did Jesus choose in teaching his disciples a valuable lesson about Jehovah?

00:06:04.769 --> 00:06:15.050
He used a sparrow, a plain somewhat drab looking little bird of small monetary value.

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:20.930
Spotted along on screen as I read Matthew 10 verses 29 and 31.

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:25.889
Two sparrow sell for a coin of small value, do they not?

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:33.329
Yet not one of them will fall to the ground without your father's knowledge.

00:06:33.329 --> 00:06:38.449
But even the hairs of your head are all numbered.

00:06:38.449 --> 00:06:45.610
So have no fear, you are worth more than many sparrows.

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:53.209
Jesus represented Jehovah's view of all those who have dedicated themselves to Him

00:06:53.209 --> 00:06:56.769
and are trying to remain faithful.

00:06:56.769 --> 00:06:58.410
Think about it.

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:04.050
Jehovah likely notices when an indigo, bunting, a cardinal,

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:08.089
or a Baltimore Oreo falls to the ground.

00:07:08.129 --> 00:07:16.410
But Jesus made a significant point when he chose to use a sparrow in his illustration.

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:23.089
Jehovah is not impressed with the beauty of one's physical appearance.

00:07:23.089 --> 00:07:31.810
He loves us as much as he loves any of his faithful servants, despite our appearance.

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:36.329
In fact, Jesus went a step further and said,

00:07:36.329 --> 00:07:42.689
you are worth more than many sparrows.

00:07:42.689 --> 00:07:44.850
You're not just a bird.

00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:52.449
You are a precious human who has come to know and love Jehovah.

00:07:52.449 --> 00:07:56.569
He loves you not because of your appearance.

00:07:56.569 --> 00:08:05.970
Being handsome, drab looking, short, heavy, skinny, bold, beautiful,

00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:12.610
less than beautiful, having warts or limp or missing limbs,

00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:19.569
being cross-eyed or having a different skin color or shape of your eyes.

00:08:19.569 --> 00:08:20.970
No.

00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:28.500
Jehovah loves you because of who you are at heart.

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:32.580
Do you remember what Jehovah told Samuel?

00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:41.659
Man sees what appears through the eyes, but Jehovah sees into the heart.

00:08:41.659 --> 00:08:47.379
Yes, Jehovah looks at you and sees the secret person of the heart

00:08:47.379 --> 00:08:50.460
that came to love your God.

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:52.460
The universal sovereign.

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:57.539
You cannot take that aspect away from the attention of Jehovah.

00:08:57.539 --> 00:09:04.019
If you love him, like Jesus indicates you can, he loves you,

00:09:04.019 --> 00:09:09.379
despite any external appearances.

00:09:09.379 --> 00:09:14.220
You likely remember Jesus said at Mark 1230,

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:20.100
you must love Jehovah your God with your whole heart

00:09:20.139 --> 00:09:28.139
and with your whole soul and with your whole mind and with your whole strength.

00:09:28.139 --> 00:09:29.740
That's it.

00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:35.700
Jesus did not add and your good looks.

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:37.179
No.

00:09:37.179 --> 00:09:46.460
Your appearance is not a factor in your love for Jehovah or his love for you.

00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:50.779
Maybe you say, I'm crippled in both feet.

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:53.179
I have a trouble walking.

00:09:53.179 --> 00:09:56.500
I feel dead inside.

00:09:56.500 --> 00:10:00.620
You're not the first servant of Jehovah to feel that way.

00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:04.059
The fibreshaft evidently felt that way.

00:10:04.059 --> 00:10:07.659
He too was crippled in both feet.

00:10:07.659 --> 00:10:13.259
King David had just honored him by promising to give him property

00:10:13.259 --> 00:10:17.860
and the privilege of eating his meals with the king.

00:10:17.899 --> 00:10:20.860
Notice how the fibreshaft felt about himself

00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:25.059
at 2 Samuel chapter 9 verse 8.

00:10:25.059 --> 00:10:28.940
What is your servant that you have turned your attention

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:32.620
to a dead dog like me?

00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:36.340
He did not have a high opinion of himself.

00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:41.860
It sounds like low self-esteem, doesn't it?

00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:45.779
If you have a physical impairment or a defect,

00:10:45.779 --> 00:10:52.700
you're not dead, but very much alive in Jehovah's eye.

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:58.299
Listen to what Jehovah tells you at Melachi chapter 4 verse 2.

00:10:58.299 --> 00:11:02.539
But on you who honor my name, the son of righteousness

00:11:02.539 --> 00:11:06.779
will shine with healing in its rays,

00:11:06.779 --> 00:11:11.500
and you will skip about like fattened calves.

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:15.700
Do what you can with what you have to work with.

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:18.620
Knowing Jehovah loves you and ultimately

00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:21.980
will correct any physical problem.

00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:25.580
You'll then be able to live for all eternity

00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:29.940
without any concerns about your appearance.

00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:32.620
Now let's talk about Jehovah's love force

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:37.700
despite our imperfections.

00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:42.100
If you're a human, you're imperfect.

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:44.980
Sorry, that's just the way it is.

00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:49.940
Adam passed imperfection onto all of us.

00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:55.100
Being imperfect, we will all make mistakes.

00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:59.340
We all do without exception.

00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:04.139
You'll be embarrassed at your imperfect reaction at times.

00:12:04.139 --> 00:12:06.059
But it happens.

00:12:06.059 --> 00:12:09.059
Jehovah knows our condition.

00:12:09.059 --> 00:12:16.299
He knows what Adam handed down to us, yet he still loves us

00:12:16.299 --> 00:12:19.220
despite imperfection.

00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:24.470
It really is not our fault.

00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:27.990
How can Jehovah still love us when we make mistakes?

00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:31.389
Use poor judgment on occasion.

00:12:31.389 --> 00:12:35.590
And at times fall into serious sin.

00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:39.870
Though we're sorry and repentant that way.

00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:44.350
It's on the basis of Jesus' ransom sacrifice.

00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:50.070
Let's read Mark 10, verse 45, from the screen.

00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:55.309
For even the Son of Man came not to be ministered to,

00:12:55.309 --> 00:13:00.429
but to minister and to give his life as a ransom

00:13:00.429 --> 00:13:02.909
in exchange for many.

00:13:02.909 --> 00:13:06.950
Jesus absorbs our mistakes.

00:13:06.950 --> 00:13:10.429
This is possible because he gave his perfect human life

00:13:10.429 --> 00:13:18.429
for us in exchange for what Adam lost and passed on to us.

00:13:18.429 --> 00:13:23.629
And look with me at 1 Corinthians 15, verse 22,

00:13:23.629 --> 00:13:29.309
for just as in Adam all are dying, so also in the Christ,

00:13:29.309 --> 00:13:33.149
all will be made alive.

00:13:33.149 --> 00:13:34.789
That's beautiful.

00:13:34.789 --> 00:13:39.590
Jehovah does not hold our imperfections against us

00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:43.429
as long as we acknowledge our imperfections

00:13:43.429 --> 00:13:46.870
and feel remorse in our repentant.

00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:52.860
He loves us despite the issue.

00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:55.659
Revelation chapter 21, verses 1 through 5,

00:13:55.659 --> 00:13:59.980
says that in time humans will experience

00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:08.779
the removal of tears, mourning, outcry, pain, and even death.

00:14:08.779 --> 00:14:15.100
All of these painful situations are based on the sin of Adam.

00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:21.659
They will then be gone for obedient humans.

00:14:21.659 --> 00:14:25.299
This means a return to the perfect state

00:14:25.299 --> 00:14:29.139
enjoyed by man at the beginning of human history

00:14:29.139 --> 00:14:31.539
in the Garden of Eden.

00:14:31.539 --> 00:14:35.019
So the humans will be able to enjoy not only perfection

00:14:35.019 --> 00:14:43.259
as to faith and love, but perfection as to sinlessness.

00:14:43.259 --> 00:14:46.940
At that time, they'll measure up fully

00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:52.460
and fallously to God's righteous standards for humans.

00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:56.379
Can you imagine that glorious time?

00:14:56.379 --> 00:15:01.259
Of course, perfection at that time does not mean an end

00:15:01.259 --> 00:15:06.379
to variety, as some persons often assume.

00:15:06.379 --> 00:15:11.820
The animal kingdom, which is the product of Jehovah's perfect activity,

00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:15.860
contains enormous variety.

00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:20.539
Our perfect earth is likewise filled with variety,

00:15:20.539 --> 00:15:23.700
change, and contrast.

00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:27.860
It allows for the simple and the complex

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:34.740
to plane and the fancy, the sour and the sweet,

00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:41.940
the rough and the smooth, the metals and the woods,

00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:45.059
the mountains and the valleys.

00:15:45.059 --> 00:15:51.139
It embraces the stimulating freshness of early spring,

00:15:51.139 --> 00:15:57.059
the warmth of summer, the liveliness of autumn colors,

00:15:57.059 --> 00:16:04.179
and the pure beauty of freshly fallen snow.

00:16:04.179 --> 00:16:07.179
Perfect humans will not be stereotypes

00:16:07.179 --> 00:16:12.779
with identical personalities, talents and abilities.

00:16:12.779 --> 00:16:18.820
But the beauty is that with all of the variety of appearances,

00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:27.019
talents and personalities, and perfection will be no more.

00:16:27.059 --> 00:16:32.019
Please be assured that, as we've considered from the Scriptures,

00:16:32.019 --> 00:16:38.500
Jehovah loves each one of us despite our appearances,

00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:40.460
our imperfections.

00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:47.139
May we all fully love and adore Jehovah and his son,

00:16:47.139 --> 00:16:49.820
Christ Jesus, in return.
