00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:12.179
I work as a street cleaner, either that or I do some other kind of work like decorating or system administration.

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:21.190
On April 20, they came to search the home of my wife and me.

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:28.190
I was interrogated, and after a month, court ruled to put me in free trial detention.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:48.630
When they let me out of the court room in handcuffs and put me into the vehicle, Lena, my wife, was at the exit.

00:00:48.630 --> 00:01:03.719
From her words, I could sense that she felt as though she was losing me.

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.719
They took me to the detention center in the city of Ivanova.

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:15.719
They moved me from south to south, and then they put me into what is known as the pressure cell.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:29.060
They told me I had to admit my guilt and tell them about my fellow worshippers, give them names, addresses, what they do, etc.

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:35.079
For me, that would mean losing my loyalty to God.

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:41.079
And the second thing was that it involved my loyalty to my fellow worshippers.

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:44.079
In essence, it was about showing love.

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:49.079
I said that for me, loyalty to Jehovah is about everything else.

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:53.079
So whatever happens, I will remain loyal to God.

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:58.700
I told them openly, directly.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.700
They pressure me physically and emotionally for several months.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:15.900
They brought me a Bible from the detention center's library.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:21.900
Thanks to fervent prayers, I felt how Jehovah gave me internal peace and calm.

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:28.900
It proves that Jehovah doesn't just exist, but he thinks about us. He cares for us.

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.900
Jehovah supported me through a letters from my dear wife.

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:44.080
And it was the thought that trust in Jehovah means seeing things the way he sees them.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:50.080
The prisoners who put pressure on me also expressed interest in spiritual things

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:55.080
and started asking questions relating to my beliefs.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:02.080
Someone told me that if I'm really a believer, I should have objects to prove it, such as across,

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.080
which old believers were.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.080
I told them that I could show them the Bible's viewpoint.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.080
From what I read, he made his own conclusions.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:19.080
And after some time, this prisoner came up to me and showed me that he wasn't wearing across anymore.

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:29.080
When you are in prison, the ministry isn't just about opportunities to tell people about the truth from the Bible.

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:37.080
It is more about Jehovah, using to help you keep a positive outlook and maintain joy.

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:44.080
The more we concentrate on what we had before, the more we suffer.

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:50.080
The quicker we accept the new circumstances, the quicker our joy returns to us,

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:55.080
along with the opportunity to make good use of the new circumstances.

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:01.159
The appeal instance court ruled to release me.

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:05.159
It was, of course, quite an unexpected decision.

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:12.159
At the exit, my dear wife met me and other fellow worshippers, brothers and sisters,

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:17.160
not just from my hometown, but from other cities too.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:24.300
Liana and I thought it would be good to collect some essentials.

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:28.300
So we bought some things and went to the detention center.

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:34.300
And afterwards, one of the prisoners wrote me a letter of thanks.

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.300
I heard how everyone came to meet you.

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:42.300
I tried to imagine how cool it is to be loud, valued and missed.

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.300
For some, there's not enough of that in life.

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.300
Take care of yourself, Dima.

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:54.300
The letters from my wife were such a big support for me at that time.

00:04:54.300 --> 00:05:03.300
To be honest, I saw her letters as if it were Jehovah using her to speak to me.

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.300
Nobody loves us as strongly as God.

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:12.300
You can right now feel my love to the full extent, or the love of your family and friends,

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:19.300
but the main thing is that you are in God's hands, and that is what's more important.

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:26.300
He loves you in a special way right now, and very gently looks after you and cares for your feelings.

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:33.300
By trusting in God, we can get a feeling of security, stability and calmness.

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.300
Our connection with God must be unbreakable.

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:41.300
If our strength is in God, then we will overcome everything.

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:48.300
Our suffering is just temporary, and God will reach the reward all who are loyal to Him.
