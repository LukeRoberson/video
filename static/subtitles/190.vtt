00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:04.969
Are you paying attention?

00:00:04.969 --> 00:00:11.970
Perhaps you've been asked that question by your parents, a teacher, or someone else in authority.

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:16.969
It's a good question for each of us to ask ourselves.

00:00:16.969 --> 00:00:24.969
Can you think of occasions associated with our worship that require us to pay special attention?

00:00:24.969 --> 00:00:31.969
For example, when reading the Bible, attending meetings, elders when shepherding.

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:35.969
You children when being instructed by your parents.

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.969
We want to pay attention, and yet there are so many distractions.

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.969
Electronic gadgets, the conversations and activities of those around us.

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.969
Truly, it can be a challenge to pay attention.

00:00:52.969 --> 00:01:00.969
Did you know that the phrase pay attention occurs dozens of times in the New World Translation?

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:08.969
In many of those occurrences, Jehovah is instructing his people to pay attention.

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:10.969
What does it mean to pay attention?

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:17.969
And how important is it that you and I pay attention to Jehovah?

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:24.969
The account in 1 Samuel chapter 15 will help us to answer those questions.

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:35.969
In verse 3, Jehovah instructs King Saul to strike down the Amalakites and to devote them and everything they have to destruction.

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:42.969
However, verses 8 and 9 tell us that Saul did not obey.

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:48.969
He spared the King of Amalak and the best of the animals.

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:54.969
How did Saul respond when Samuel confronted him?

00:01:54.969 --> 00:02:03.969
As we read verses 13 through 15, note how Saul tried to justify his disobedience.

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:08.969
When Samuel finally came to him, Saul said to him,

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:11.969
May Jehovah bless you.

00:02:11.969 --> 00:02:15.969
I have carried out the word of Jehovah.

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:17.969
That Samuel said,

00:02:17.969 --> 00:02:24.969
Then what is this sound of the flock in my ears and the sound of the cattle that I hear?

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:26.969
To this Saul said,

00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:37.969
they were brought from the Amalakites because the people spared the best of the flock and the herd for sacrificing them to Jehovah, your God.

00:02:37.969 --> 00:02:42.969
But what was left, we devoted to destruction.

00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:44.969
Did you notice?

00:02:44.969 --> 00:02:54.969
Saul attempted to justify his disobedience, claiming that the animals would be sacrificed to Jehovah.

00:02:54.969 --> 00:02:57.969
Was Jehovah pleased with Saul?

00:02:57.969 --> 00:03:07.969
As we read verse 22, please note the connection between paying attention and obedience.

00:03:07.969 --> 00:03:10.969
Samuel then said,

00:03:10.969 --> 00:03:19.969
Does Jehovah take as much pleasure in bird offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of Jehovah?

00:03:19.969 --> 00:03:29.969
Look, to obey is better than a sacrifice and to pay attention than the fat of grams.

00:03:29.969 --> 00:03:34.969
What was one of the causes of Saul's disobedience?

00:03:34.969 --> 00:03:38.969
He didn't pay attention to Jehovah's instructions.

00:03:38.969 --> 00:03:46.969
His failure to pay attention resulted in disobedience and brought Jehovah's disapproval.

00:03:46.969 --> 00:03:49.969
What a powerful lesson for us.

00:03:49.969 --> 00:03:59.969
As happened with Saul, our worship could become unacceptable to Jehovah if we fail to pay attention.

00:03:59.969 --> 00:04:04.969
Now that we understand why it is important to pay attention,

00:04:04.969 --> 00:04:11.969
let's consider three aspects of paying attention that are discussed in the Bible.

00:04:11.969 --> 00:04:20.980
The first scripture will consider is 2 Chronicles chapter 19, verse 6.

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:25.980
And he, that is, Jehoshaphat, said to the judges,

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:33.980
Pay attention to what you are doing for you to not judge for man, but for Jehovah.

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:39.939
And he is with you when you pass judgment.

00:04:39.939 --> 00:04:44.939
This admonition to pay attention was given by King Jehoshaphat

00:04:44.939 --> 00:04:48.939
to appoint a judge throughout the land of Judah.

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:51.939
What a sobering reminder.

00:04:51.939 --> 00:04:57.939
Those judges had good reason to pay attention to what they were doing.

00:04:57.939 --> 00:05:02.939
Why? They were responsible to Jehovah.

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:08.939
They represented him, and their decisions affected the lives of fellow worshippers.

00:05:08.939 --> 00:05:13.939
Thus, they needed to be familiar with Jehovah's thinking on matters

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:18.939
and to hold to his unprejudiced viewpoint when handling matters.

00:05:18.939 --> 00:05:23.939
This is an excellent reminder for those who serve as elders.

00:05:23.939 --> 00:05:29.939
Good elders are good students of the Bible and Bible-based publications.

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:37.939
Why? Their attentiveness to Jehovah enables them to pay attention to what they are doing.

00:05:38.939 --> 00:05:45.939
If they are going to represent Jehovah and reflect his thinking accurately as they handle matters,

00:05:45.939 --> 00:05:50.939
whether they are shepherding the congregation, delivering a part at a meeting,

00:05:50.939 --> 00:05:55.939
caring for a challenging assignment, or addressing wrongdoing,

00:05:55.939 --> 00:05:59.939
they must pay attention to what they are doing.

00:05:59.939 --> 00:06:03.939
That is why they must be familiar with Jehovah's thinking,

00:06:03.939 --> 00:06:06.939
and then take care to follow his direction.

00:06:07.939 --> 00:06:13.939
If they do, they show that they are paying attention to what they are doing.

00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:21.939
Jehovah's interest in assisting the elders is demonstrated in the ongoing education he provides.

00:06:21.939 --> 00:06:29.939
Each time the circuit overseer visits the congregation, he presents material prepared especially for the elders.

00:06:30.939 --> 00:06:37.939
The King to Ministry School and the School for Congregation Elders provide more intensive instruction.

00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:45.939
How important that elders pay close attention to and apply such instruction.

00:06:45.939 --> 00:06:52.939
They are doing so protect not just themselves, but also fellow worshippers.

00:06:52.939 --> 00:06:59.939
By paying attention, elders will be able to convey direction to the congregations accurately.

00:06:59.939 --> 00:07:10.939
This can be especially important if our worship is banned or restricted in the event of a natural disaster or other catastrophic event.

00:07:10.939 --> 00:07:16.939
This brings us to the second aspect of paying attention that we'll consider.

00:07:16.939 --> 00:07:21.939
Let's read Luke chapter 8, verse 18.

00:07:22.939 --> 00:07:31.939
Therefore, pay attention to how you listen for whoever has will be given more.

00:07:31.939 --> 00:07:40.470
But whoever does not have even what he imagines he has will be taken away from him.

00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:47.470
What did Jesus mean when he said, pay attention to how you listen?

00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:57.470
Those in Jesus' audience in the first century had the wonderful privilege of hearing Jesus' literal voice as he instructed them.

00:07:57.470 --> 00:08:08.470
Of course, we can't hear the voice of Jesus today, but we can read his words and learn of his actions as revealed in the gospel accounts.

00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:13.470
In fact, we have many opportunities to listen.

00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:26.470
To Jehovah, Jesus, the faithful and discreet slave, the elders in our congregation, our marriagemate, our children.

00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:33.470
Note wonder the Bible writer James stated that everyone must be quick to listen.

00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:35.470
Think about it.

00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:49.470
If Saul had truly listened receptively to Jehovah's direction regarding the Amalakites, he would likely have grasped the importance of the direction he received and would have been motivated to obey.

00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:58.470
However, his lack of attentiveness led to disobedience and Jehovah's disapproval.

00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:10.470
If we don't pay attention to how we listen, we could find ourselves becoming critical or unappreciative or even disobedient.

00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:27.470
So as Jehovah instructs and directs us, we need to think about what we are being told, ponder over its meaning, mallet over in our mind, and most important, apply the instruction in our own lives.

00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:36.470
If you're a young person, how can you show that you're paying attention to how you listen?

00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:43.470
Consider the admonition in Ephesians chapter 6 verses 1 through 3.

00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:51.470
Children, be obedient to your parents and union with the Lord, for this is righteous.

00:09:51.470 --> 00:10:05.039
On her, your father and your mother, is the first command with the promise that it may go well with you, and you may remain a long ta'ah on the earth.

00:10:05.039 --> 00:10:11.039
You children, who do you think is the source of this direction?

00:10:11.039 --> 00:10:15.039
We know that these words come from Jehovah.

00:10:15.039 --> 00:10:28.039
Did you notice that the verses state not only that children should be obedient to their parents, but also that they should honor their parents?

00:10:28.039 --> 00:10:35.039
How can you show that you're paying attention to how you listen to this direction?

00:10:35.039 --> 00:10:44.039
When I was a boy, I can remember occasions when my parents would ask me to do something, perhaps to take out the trash.

00:10:44.039 --> 00:10:53.039
I would always obey, but at times I'd make it very clear that I didn't really want to do what was asked.

00:10:53.039 --> 00:10:58.379
I think you young ones know what I mean.

00:10:58.379 --> 00:11:12.379
However, if we're truly paying attention to how we listen to Jehovah's words, we'll be careful to honor our parents, which is an essential element of obedience.

00:11:12.379 --> 00:11:21.379
In this way, we contribute to the peace of the family, and we make Jehovah's heart glad.

00:11:21.379 --> 00:11:35.379
Additionally, as the promise in verse 3 indicates, paying attention to how you listen will protect you and contribute to your success in other ways throughout your adult life.

00:11:35.379 --> 00:11:45.379
Of course, all of us should remember that our everlasting welfare will depend on our willingness to listen and obey.

00:11:45.379 --> 00:11:52.379
How important, then, that all of us pay attention to how we listen.

00:11:52.379 --> 00:12:07.460
The third aspect of paying attention is found at Luke chapter 21 verses 34 and 35, but pay attention to yourselves.

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:23.350
That your hearts never become weighed down with overeating and heavy drinking and anxieties of life, and suddenly, that day be instantly upon you as a snare.

00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:39.350
When Jesus admonished his followers to pay attention to themselves, he didn't have in mind the selfish thinking that characterized King Saul, and that so common even encouraged in today's world.

00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:51.350
Rather, Jesus' words reveal that the key to paying attention to ourselves is knowing ourselves, knowing what's in our figurative heart.

00:12:51.350 --> 00:13:00.350
This is a challenge for all of us. Why? The Bible explains in Jeremiah chapter 17 verse 9,

00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:06.350
the heart is more treacherous than anything else and is desperate.

00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:12.350
Who can know it? Verse 10 answers,

00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:19.350
I Jehovah am searching the heart, examining the innermost thoughts.

00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:26.350
So Jehovah knows what is in our heart, and he can help us to know.

00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:34.350
He can help us to examine our motives and goal holds, and to discern why we do certain things.

00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:46.350
Carefully and honestly, looking at ourselves in the mirror of God's word can reveal areas in our thinking, words, and actions that need attention.

00:13:46.350 --> 00:14:01.350
For example, some of Jehovah's people, including those of retirement age who enjoyed very comfortable circumstances, have concluded that they needed to make adjustments in their lifestyle, simplifying their lives,

00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:05.350
so that they can serve Jehovah more fully.

00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:12.350
Some who have done so have had the privilege of attending the school for kingdom evangelizers.

00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:24.350
Although it meant stepping out of their comfort zone, perhaps moving to a new congregation, they've experienced Jehovah's blessing in ways they couldn't have anticipated,

00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:31.350
as they share the benefits of their experience and theocratic education in their new assignments.

00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:42.730
How grateful we are that Jehovah is providing ongoing life-saving instruction by means of his word and organization.

00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:53.730
May each of us be determined to pay attention to what we are doing, to how we listen, and to ourselves.

00:14:53.730 --> 00:15:00.730
By doing so, we'll avoid falling into the trap of disobedience, as King Saul did.

00:15:00.730 --> 00:15:09.730
Instead, as attentive and obedient surface, we'll enjoy Jehovah's friendship forever.
