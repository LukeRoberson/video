00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:22.179
The universe is vast and awe-inspiring.

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:26.179
Earth and life on it are amazingly complex.

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:31.859
How did it all get here?

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:41.820
The Bible book of Genesis says that there is a creator.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.820
But the account is often misunderstood or even dismissed as a myth.

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:55.799
Is what the Bible says about the origin of the universe plausible?

00:00:55.799 --> 00:01:01.799
Scientists estimate that the universe is 14 billion years old.

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:06.799
This implies that the universe, including Earth, had a beginning.

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:13.849
The Bible agrees. Genesis 1, 1 reads,

00:01:13.849 --> 00:01:18.849
In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.

00:01:18.849 --> 00:01:23.849
The account does not say when or how the universe began.

00:01:23.849 --> 00:01:31.849
Rather, it focuses on the creative process that took place on Earth over six periods of time,

00:01:31.849 --> 00:01:34.849
which the Bible calls days.

00:01:34.849 --> 00:01:40.260
Were these six 24-hour days as many believed?

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
No.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:48.260
The Hebrew word used in the Bible for day can refer to various lengths of time.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:54.260
Genesis even summarizes the six days of creation as one day.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.260
The day that Jehovah God made Earth and Heaven.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:06.260
Each day in Genesis chapter 1 must have spanned extremely long periods of time.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:11.259
The account's perspective is also important.

00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:18.259
The writer describes the creative periods as they would have appeared to an observer on the Earth.

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:23.259
Had someone been there, he would have seen events that started in one period,

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:27.259
and then progress into the following periods.

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:34.860
Light penetrates the atmosphere to reveal alternating day and night.

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:40.860
Earth was covered with water, and vapor filled the air.

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:47.860
The dense clouds lifted from the waters that covered the Earth, forming an expansive sky between them.

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:56.389
Water receded to uncover dry ground, and the first plants appeared.

00:02:56.389 --> 00:03:02.389
The atmosphere cleared further to reveal the sun and the moon.

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:08.389
God created living creatures in the sea and flying creatures above.

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:14.389
And in the last period, God created land animals and humans.

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:25.949
In harmony with the Genesis account, the Bible says,

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:29.949
Of course, every house is constructed by someone,

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:34.949
but the one who constructed all things is God.

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:38.949
The Bible does not speak in scientific detail,

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:43.949
but its account of creation is logical and reasonable.
