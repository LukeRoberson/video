00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:07.980
Well, today's Scripture text, and Ecclesiastes chapter 7, verse 10, it might be good to read it in its entirety.

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.980
It says here, do not say, why were the former days better than these?

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.980
For it is not out of wisdom that you ask this.

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:24.980
Now, it is possible that a person who reads this verse, perhaps for the first time,

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.980
might disagree with this statement.

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:34.979
For example, based on his own personal experience, an older person might remember the days when he was younger.

00:00:34.979 --> 00:00:40.979
He was healthier, he was stronger, he had energy to accomplish virtually anything he wanted to do.

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:48.979
His memory was sharper, and now that he is getting older, he is forgetful, he is tired, and grumpy.

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:54.979
He may say that the former days were better than the present.

00:00:54.979 --> 00:01:02.979
Or, perhaps we know of someone who had to leave Bethel, or perhaps another form of special full-time service,

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:10.980
and now they long for the days that they served at Bethel, or perhaps pioneered or missionary service.

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:16.980
Well, what if another example is we are transferred to a different department at Bethel.

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.980
Now we are struggling to learn a new assignment.

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.980
We are trying to adapt to a different routine.

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:28.980
Our overseer is just not the same as our former overseer.

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:36.980
Well, we might think the former days were better than the present, possibly.

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:42.980
So what will help us to understand Ecclesiastes chapter 7 and verse 10 a little better?

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.980
Well, let's take our first example of the older person.

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:52.980
The watchtower from which our text is taken says that older ones show humility,

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:59.980
who show humility, will have a realistic view of the way things were in the past.

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:01.980
So how does that realistic view help?

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:09.979
Well, although we recognize that some things were better in the past, many things are better now.

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.979
For example, although a person may have had more energy and strength when they were young,

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:21.979
most often, as a person ages, they learn to work smarter, not harder.

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:28.979
So to make a blanket statement, why were the former days better than these, isn't realistic?

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:32.979
It isn't wisdom, as the Scripture says.

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:38.979
In addition to helping us be realistic, Ecclesiastes chapter 7 and verse 10

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:41.979
helps us to be content.

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:43.979
How so?

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:50.979
Well, if we constantly view the past as being better, will we be content with the present?

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:52.979
It's not likely.

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:59.979
We will probably live in a constant state of discontent wishing that we could go back in time.

00:02:59.979 --> 00:03:03.979
But is that realistic and does that make us any happier?

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:06.979
No, it's not wise.

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:14.979
But Ecclesiastes chapter 7 and verse 10 can also help us in a more sobering way.

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:19.979
In article on our 2018 midweek workbook said,

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:25.979
when we experience difficulties, it's easy to long for the good old days,

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:29.979
perhaps the days before we came into the truth.

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:37.979
When doing so, we often exaggerate the joys and minimize the problems of the past.

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:42.979
And that is what the Israelites did after they left Egypt.

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:44.979
How did the Israelites do that?

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:50.979
Well, the account referred to here in this reference is numbers chapter 11 and verses 5 and 6.

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:52.979
Let's take a look at that.

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:56.979
Numbers chapter 11 and verses 5 and 6.

00:03:56.979 --> 00:04:01.379
Here's the Israelites said,

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:06.379
how fondly we remember the fish that we used to eat without cost in Egypt.

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:12.379
Also the cucumbers, the watermelons, the leaks, the onions, and the garlic.

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:15.379
But now we are withering away.

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:19.379
We see nothing at all except this mana.

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:24.379
Well, through the rose-colored lens of nostalgia,

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:28.379
they remember the fish and the melons and the vegetables,

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:35.379
but not the hard slavery that made their lives miserable every single day.

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:38.379
So they actually viewed the former days as better.

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:41.379
In fact, looking back at the past,

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:48.379
actually blinded them to all that Jehovah was doing for them right then in the present.

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:51.379
For example, the mana.

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:57.379
The mana appeared every morning simply out of nowhere in the middle of a wilderness.

00:04:57.379 --> 00:05:00.379
The Israelites didn't have to plow the ground.

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:02.379
They didn't have to plant any seeds.

00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:04.379
They didn't have to water.

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:10.379
And harvesting was as easy as just picking it up off the morning dew.

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:14.379
Evidently, the mana was also a perfect food,

00:05:14.379 --> 00:05:20.379
satisfying all of their dietary needs in one easy meal.

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:22.379
And it was tasty.

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:26.379
The Bible says it tasted like an oiled, sweet cake.

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:28.379
Not bad.

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:34.379
Well, mana provided another advantage that perhaps the Israelites didn't think about.

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:39.379
Remember that they never knew when that miraculous cloud was going to lift,

00:05:39.379 --> 00:05:45.379
and suddenly the whole camp was going to have to follow that cloud to another location.

00:05:45.379 --> 00:05:50.379
Can you imagine even if you did bring some watermelon seeds with you from Egypt

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:55.379
and you managed to plant a few and you started watering them and all of a sudden what happens?

00:05:55.379 --> 00:06:03.379
The cloud lifts and the whole nation begins to depart long before you get to harvest your watermelons.

00:06:03.379 --> 00:06:09.379
Well, we can see that mana was actually a perfect solution in every way.

00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:19.379
And yet by looking back at the past, the Israelites were blinded to all that Jehovah was doing for them in the present.

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:24.379
So what lessons do we learn from Ecclesiastes chapter 7 and verse 10?

00:06:24.379 --> 00:06:31.379
Well, looking back at what seems to be the good old days produces discontent with the present.

00:06:31.379 --> 00:06:36.379
And discontent can lead us to feeling ungrateful.

00:06:36.379 --> 00:06:39.379
All for all that Jehovah is doing for us now.

00:06:39.379 --> 00:06:50.379
For the Israelites that in gratitude also led to unfaithfulness and spiritual disaster ultimately.

00:06:50.379 --> 00:06:55.379
And this regard note this comment from the 2012 Watchtower.

00:06:55.379 --> 00:07:01.379
It says, although it is not wrong to meditate on the lessons we have learned from past experiences

00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:09.379
or to savor cherished memories, we need to maintain a balanced, realistic view of the past.

00:07:09.379 --> 00:07:17.379
Otherwise, we could accentuate our dissatisfaction with our present circumstances.

00:07:17.379 --> 00:07:23.379
Yes, realistically, some things in the past may have been good.

00:07:23.379 --> 00:07:30.379
Perhaps we did have better health, but it wasn't perfect health.

00:07:30.379 --> 00:07:38.379
And we may have enjoyed certain theocratic privileges, or maybe we had an excellent relationship with our work overseer in the past.

00:07:38.379 --> 00:07:49.379
But can any privilege or any relationship that we have now compare to the privileges that we're going to enjoy in the future?

00:07:49.379 --> 00:07:51.379
Not at all.

00:07:51.379 --> 00:08:02.379
As our midweek workbook mentioned how much better it is to count our present blessings and to focus on future joys under God's kingdom.

00:08:02.379 --> 00:08:09.379
And isn't it true also that the challenging things that we may deal with now often refine us?

00:08:09.379 --> 00:08:12.379
They make us better Christians.

00:08:12.379 --> 00:08:19.379
So if we avoid viewing the past through the blurry lens of nostalgia,

00:08:19.379 --> 00:08:27.379
if we cultivate contentment with the present and we keep our eyes focused on the kingdom and the real life,

00:08:27.379 --> 00:08:32.379
we'll be happier and also more likely to remain faithful.

00:08:32.379 --> 00:08:37.379
As Ecclesiastes chapter 7 and verse 10 reminds us,

00:08:37.379 --> 00:08:43.379
the better days are not behind us. They're actually just a hand.
