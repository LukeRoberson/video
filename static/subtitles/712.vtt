00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:12.359
In the past few graduation programs, we've had a new feature entitled The Inside Story.

00:00:12.359 --> 00:00:15.359
And we're going to have another inside story.

00:00:15.359 --> 00:00:20.359
One of the instructors, Brother Trent Leapold, is now going to present the two of us.

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:52.420
Far in the North Atlantic to the islands of the South Pacific,

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.420
you will meet some cool and colorful brothers and sisters in this 145th class.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:05.420
They sort of on five continents represent 31 countries and speak more than 45 individual or different languages.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:14.989
So let's meet our first guest and he's from the Central European Branch, Brother Alex Schultz.

00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:26.819
Alex, I understand in your assignment, you have quite an expansive assignment.

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:30.819
Well, I work with a team that helps foreign language circuits.

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:33.819
Okay, very nice. So foreign language circuits in Germany.

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:37.819
And not just Germany, further.

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:40.819
Foreign language circuits in the Central European Branch.

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:42.819
Even a little further, Trent.

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:44.819
Okay, Alex, you're going to have to help me out with this.

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:46.819
What exactly does your assignment evolve?

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:51.819
Well, our team in the Central Europe branch works with 22 other branch offices

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:56.819
to form and coordinate foreign language circuits that span the continent.

00:01:56.819 --> 00:02:00.819
In languages that are assigned to the project by the service committee of the governing body.

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:02.819
Wow, that sounds huge.

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:04.819
There must be a good reason for it.

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:05.819
Yeah, sure, there is.

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:10.819
I mean, as we know, normally, a circuit consists of a group of congregations

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:14.819
and perhaps a few groups within one branch territory.

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:17.819
Now, in Europe, we know we have quite a number of countries

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:20.819
and also a number of branch territories.

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:23.819
So what happened in the past is that in some languages

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.819
there were foreign language congregations or groups

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:29.819
that had to be visited by a local circuit overseer

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:31.819
who didn't speak the language.

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:34.819
And that was simply because perhaps in this branch territory

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:37.819
they didn't have a circuit overseer who speaks the language

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:42.819
or they didn't have enough congregations to form their own foreign language circuit

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:44.819
in that branch territory.

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:48.819
And that, of course, poses a challenge if the CEO doesn't speak that language

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:52.819
or he's not so familiar with the territory or that language.

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:53.819
Sure, I can see that.

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:56.819
And then it would be difficult for him to really give specific direction

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:57.819
to the congregation.

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:58.819
And that's the thing.

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:01.819
And some publishers in these groups perhaps felt isolated.

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:06.819
Besides, they didn't necessarily have a circuit assembly or pioneer meeting

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:08.819
in their language or in their vicinity.

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:09.819
Right.

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:12.819
But I know the governing body made a change about that.

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:14.819
Yeah, and that was excellent.

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:15.819
I mean, it's a beautiful project.

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:20.819
Since 2016, we have now what we call foreign language circuits

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:23.819
that span branch territories in Europe.

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:26.819
Okay. Well, how does this work now?

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:30.819
Well, imagine Europe or perhaps best we take a look at a map.

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:31.819
We have a map of Europe.

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:32.819
Super.

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:33.819
Very good.

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:35.819
And this is how we look at Europe in this project.

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:38.819
Europe without borders.

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:39.819
Okay.

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:43.819
All we want to see is where are the foreign language congregations in groups?

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:46.819
So maybe best we can see this in one example with the Chinese field.

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:47.819
Wow.

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:50.819
So we look at all the congregations in groups.

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:52.819
We see them depicted here.

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:57.819
And simply what we do is we group them together by a number of parameters

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:59.819
into circuits.

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:02.819
But this is regardless of any national borders.

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:07.819
And what results is all these groups and congregations are in actual circuits.

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:10.819
They have their circuit events.

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:12.819
They have their pioneer meetings.

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:16.819
And they have their circuit overseer who speaks their language.

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:19.819
And they meet together for circuit assemblies.

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:22.819
More people come together from various countries.

00:04:22.819 --> 00:04:23.819
Wonderful atmosphere.

00:04:23.819 --> 00:04:24.819
Very nice. That's incredible.

00:04:24.819 --> 00:04:26.819
So this is the Chinese circuit.

00:04:26.819 --> 00:04:27.819
That's Chinese.

00:04:27.819 --> 00:04:33.819
We have Russian here with the 20 circuits that we have right now that span Europe.

00:04:33.819 --> 00:04:37.819
And here's the Romani field with growing circuits in Europe.

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:38.819
Very interesting.

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:41.819
I mean, how many are we talking about Alex?

00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:45.819
Right now we have in the project 115 circuits

00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:48.819
with more than 4,000 congregations in groups involved.

00:04:48.819 --> 00:04:49.819
Wow.

00:04:49.819 --> 00:04:52.819
And as to date, 18 languages have been assigned to the project.

00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:53.819
That is remarkable.

00:04:53.819 --> 00:04:54.819
So what would you say?

00:04:54.819 --> 00:04:59.819
How are the brothers and sisters in these foreign language congregations in circuits benefit?

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:02.819
Well, we have very positive reflections from the field.

00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:07.819
The publishers often appreciate the fact that they now receive

00:05:07.819 --> 00:05:11.819
theocratic care by a circuit overseer who speaks their language.

00:05:11.819 --> 00:05:13.819
And that's a beautiful aspect.

00:05:13.819 --> 00:05:16.819
Besides that, because of this, now,

00:05:16.819 --> 00:05:19.819
theoretically borderless Europe, if we want to call it this way,

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:23.819
we as branch offices have more opportunity to work together

00:05:23.819 --> 00:05:26.819
to organize conventions in these languages,

00:05:26.819 --> 00:05:30.819
circuit assemblies, schools, pioneer meetings,

00:05:30.819 --> 00:05:33.819
and all of this furthers the preaching work.

00:05:33.819 --> 00:05:34.819
And that's amazing to see.

00:05:34.819 --> 00:05:36.819
Well, that's the benefit, isn't it? That's tremendous.

00:05:36.819 --> 00:05:40.819
You know, Alex, for us in Gilead, most of the instructors of Gilead,

00:05:40.819 --> 00:05:42.819
we've been in the circuit work.

00:05:42.819 --> 00:05:44.819
So, circuit work is close to our hearts.

00:05:44.819 --> 00:05:48.819
As I'm looking at these huge circuits, I'm asking myself,

00:05:48.819 --> 00:05:52.819
how do these circuit overseers care for such huge territories?

00:05:52.819 --> 00:05:53.819
What is it like?

00:05:53.819 --> 00:05:55.819
You know, that's a very good question,

00:05:55.819 --> 00:05:58.819
because these brothers and sisters work so hard in these fields.

00:05:58.819 --> 00:06:03.819
Actually, we have a little video that follows one traveling couple,

00:06:03.819 --> 00:06:04.819
brother and sister Dietrich.

00:06:04.819 --> 00:06:07.819
They are traveling in one of the Albanian circuits

00:06:07.819 --> 00:06:09.819
that span branch territories in Europe.

00:06:09.819 --> 00:06:11.819
And if you like, we could take a look at the video and see how they're doing.

00:06:11.819 --> 00:06:14.819
Excellent. Let's look at the video now then.

00:06:14.819 --> 00:06:24.009
Today, many Albanian witnesses are settled in different countries.

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:27.009
But they are not isolated.

00:06:27.009 --> 00:06:35.779
Eda and I are serving one of the three Albanian circuits in Europe

00:06:35.779 --> 00:06:38.779
that span branch territories.

00:06:38.779 --> 00:06:45.699
Serving a multinational circuit takes extra effort and planning.

00:06:45.699 --> 00:06:50.519
But, seem to you who have a scare for these people.

00:06:50.519 --> 00:06:53.519
No matter the situation, it's worth it.

00:06:58.899 --> 00:07:01.899
We are a small congregation in a foreign country.

00:07:01.899 --> 00:07:04.899
Our circuit is now supported by Albanian speaking brothers

00:07:04.899 --> 00:07:06.899
from several European countries.

00:07:06.899 --> 00:07:09.899
And we feel the unity in our brotherhood even more.

00:07:09.899 --> 00:07:20.740
At this region of convention,

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:25.740
brothers and sisters are attending from Germany, Austria, Belgium,

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:29.740
Great Britain, and Switzerland.

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:32.740
We have met many friends who speak our language.

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:34.740
We are learning a lot about them

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:37.740
and are encouraged by their example of faith.

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:49.730
In the circuit, those in northern Italy

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:54.730
are together with others in Germany, Austria, and Slovenia.

00:07:54.730 --> 00:08:00.360
They are united across national borders

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:11.649
with others who speak Albanian.

00:08:11.649 --> 00:08:12.649
That's beautiful, Alex.

00:08:12.649 --> 00:08:14.649
United in the spiritual paradise.

00:08:14.649 --> 00:08:16.649
I know borders. That's true.

00:08:16.649 --> 00:08:21.649
I think about this, though, Alex, some say that language actually divides.

00:08:21.649 --> 00:08:24.649
I mean, that goes back to the Tower of Babel.

00:08:24.649 --> 00:08:29.649
And some might feel that, well, by grouping people into language groups,

00:08:29.649 --> 00:08:31.649
you're actually dividing people.

00:08:31.649 --> 00:08:33.649
How would you answer that?

00:08:33.649 --> 00:08:36.649
Well, you know, language definitely has the potential to divide.

00:08:36.649 --> 00:08:38.649
No question.

00:08:38.649 --> 00:08:42.649
But honestly, by the way the organization is using language,

00:08:42.649 --> 00:08:45.649
I see the opposite effect taking place.

00:08:45.649 --> 00:08:50.649
You know, this project is not about promoting particular cultures

00:08:50.649 --> 00:08:52.649
or particular languages.

00:08:52.649 --> 00:08:59.649
What this project allows us to do is to reach across man-made borders

00:08:59.649 --> 00:09:04.649
to unite our brothers and sisters by using their local language

00:09:04.649 --> 00:09:07.649
to teach the true and pure language.

00:09:07.649 --> 00:09:10.649
And that is unity, as we've seen in the video.

00:09:10.649 --> 00:09:12.649
Well, we look forward to hearing about more of those details.

00:09:12.649 --> 00:09:13.649
Thank you.

00:09:13.649 --> 00:09:16.649
Just maybe in conclusion, Alex, one final thought.

00:09:16.649 --> 00:09:20.649
Thinking about your assignment, is there one particular thought from Gilead?

00:09:20.649 --> 00:09:22.649
I know there's probably many.

00:09:22.649 --> 00:09:27.649
But is there one particular thought that you would like to especially apply in your assignment?

00:09:27.649 --> 00:09:28.649
Yeah.

00:09:28.649 --> 00:09:29.649
There are many.

00:09:29.649 --> 00:09:35.649
Maybe just one that was repeatedly mentioned in class is how Jesus worked with others.

00:09:35.649 --> 00:09:42.649
Never as a superior, but as a friend, as a confident, open trusted communication.

00:09:42.649 --> 00:09:44.649
That's a beautiful example.

00:09:44.649 --> 00:09:49.649
I just hope that I can pick up a little bit on this wonderful example

00:09:49.649 --> 00:09:54.649
when I have the privilege to talk to these circuit overseers out there in this huge field.

00:09:54.649 --> 00:09:58.649
Or when we talk to the other responsible brothers in the other branch offices

00:09:58.649 --> 00:10:04.649
that it is this open, trusted communication as friends and as fellow workers

00:10:04.649 --> 00:10:07.649
we all have the same goal furthering the preaching work.

00:10:07.649 --> 00:10:09.649
That's a goal I have.

00:10:09.649 --> 00:10:11.649
Very nice. It's a valuable point for all of us.

00:10:11.649 --> 00:10:15.649
Well, Alex made Jehovah richly bless you and your wife Tabitha and your assignment.

00:10:15.649 --> 00:10:16.649
Thank you very much.

00:10:16.649 --> 00:10:17.649
Thank you.

00:10:17.649 --> 00:10:29.940
Let's welcome our next guest and it's Brother Thomas Bohnfeld from Greenland.

00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:38.340
Hey, welcome, Tommy.

00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:40.340
You look very comfortable.

00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:42.340
Oh, thank you, right?

00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:44.340
So what do you call that?

00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:46.340
This is an anoac.

00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:50.340
You know it's all about staying warm in Greenland.

00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:56.340
So actually this is a traditional formal wear and it is used for special occasions.

00:10:56.340 --> 00:11:00.340
So many brothers wear it at the conventions on the day of baptism.

00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:01.340
This is very special.

00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:04.340
Well, I like Greenland already. Tell you that.

00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:07.340
When I think of Greenland though, I'm thinking not Greenland.

00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:10.340
I'm thinking ice, snow.

00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:12.340
Yeah, you are right.

00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:15.340
It is really a land of ice and snow.

00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:18.340
Most of Greenland lies within the Arctic Circle.

00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:22.340
The biggest part of the land is the Greenland ice sheet.

00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:26.340
And it's up to 3,000 meters thick in the center.

00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:30.340
And from there huge icebergs break off out to the sea.

00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:32.340
Icebergs like this one.

00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:33.340
Yes.

00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:38.340
Yeah, that definitely sounds cool to me.

00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:42.340
So what I wonder though is what are the people like in Greenland?

00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:44.340
Ah, that's where the warmth is.

00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:48.340
People in Greenland are very kind and warm-hearted.

00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:50.340
Greenland is part of Kingdom of Denmark.

00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:53.340
So many they speak Danish.

00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:58.340
But the majority, the native Inuit, they speak Greenlandic.

00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:03.340
Greenlandic, when I think of Greenlandic, the only thing that comes to mind is long words.

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:07.340
Yes, that's the first thing many people notice about Greenlandic.

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:12.340
For example, we have the title of the watchtower in two lines.

00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:14.340
I don't think I can.

00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:16.340
But you said it so well.

00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:20.340
As I look at that though, I wonder, do you have spelling contests in Greenland?

00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:24.340
No, we don't have chances.

00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:27.340
You and Penina, do you speak Greenlandic?

00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:30.340
Yes, we do now, but we're still learning.

00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:31.340
Of course.

00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:33.340
How did you learn Greenlandic?

00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:37.340
So we are originally from Denmark and brought up in Denmark.

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:43.340
But interestingly, my parents actually were especially pioneers when they were young in Greenland and helped form a congregation.

00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:47.340
Well, that's very interesting. That's a nice spiritual heritage to have.

00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:51.340
And some years ago, we visited Greenland as a family.

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:54.340
And we see pictures here.

00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:56.340
We still look relaxed, Thomas.

00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:58.340
Actually, back then, I remembered.

00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:01.340
Perhaps I could serve in Greenland sometime.

00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:04.340
But I think that's what I think.

00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:08.340
But then, years passed, I began to call Penina.

00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:13.340
And when we were engaged to Mary, we asked the parents where we could serve.

00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:18.340
And to our surprise, they asked us to start learning Greenlandic.

00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:23.340
So we moved to Copenhagen and took some language courses.

00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:29.340
And after three years, we were sent to Greenland as a specific pioneer and helped support the translation.

00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:35.340
So three years, we were sent to Greenland as specific pioneers and helped support the translation office.

00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:39.340
That's amazing. So it's almost like you were following in your parents footsteps then to Greenland.

00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:43.340
So was it an easy adjustment? Denmark, Greenland?

00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:47.340
No. Denmark and Greenland are very different.

00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:54.340
But with the help from Jehovah and also from support from Brothers, we adapted.

00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:57.340
Yeah. It looks like you fully adapted, actually.

00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:01.340
I understand your assignment has changed a little bit over the years.

00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:06.340
So now we are at the ATO in Luke in the Greenlandic ATO.

00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:08.340
There are four of us in full time.

00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:11.340
And we have more than 10 parts on computers.

00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:14.340
Okay. So that's more than 14 in the ATO.

00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:16.340
But it's still a small group.

00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:20.340
That's a lot of work for a translation office.

00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:23.340
Is there benefits? Have you seen the benefits from the work you're doing?

00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:25.340
Yes, definitely.

00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:30.340
So in Greenlandic, there's not much published secular.

00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:33.340
But our publication has been published for many years.

00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:35.340
And they're very well known.

00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:39.340
So people really love when they see our literature.

00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:46.340
And besides that, our videos in Greenlandic are great support for many of the knee-graders coming to support the Ministry in Greenlandic.

00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:47.340
Right.

00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:49.340
Now I wonder what the Ministry was like.

00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:51.340
Now we did a little homework on Greenland.

00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:56.340
I know there's five congregations in Greenland, about 170 publishers,

00:14:56.340 --> 00:15:00.340
and around 56,000 people that live in Greenland.

00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:04.340
But we also understand that a lot of them live in very remote villages.

00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:08.340
So how do you reach those people in these isolated areas?

00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:11.340
Well, that's all about timing.

00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:12.340
Timing? Yeah.

00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:18.340
But to help you understand it, we have a video from a congregation far north of Luke

00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:23.340
in the village of Iluli-Set, meaning icebergs.

00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:26.340
Well, let's have a look and let's visit the icebergs.

00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:39.539
For about seven months of the year, Greenland looks like this.

00:15:39.539 --> 00:15:50.590
But when the ice melts, signs of life begin to emerge.

00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:56.919
And the brothers and sisters get moving.

00:15:56.919 --> 00:16:02.940
The Danish congregation in the town of Iluli-Set

00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:06.940
preaches also to Greenlandic speaking people.

00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:11.940
It's the northernmost congregation in Greenland.

00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:16.940
They travel to many remote villages to spread the good news in Greenlandic.

00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:36.779
Their territory spans hundreds of miles.

00:16:36.779 --> 00:16:40.779
Today, they are preaching in the village of Okartut.

00:16:40.779 --> 00:16:52.850
It's good to be out of the boat after their long journey.

00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:54.850
But their work is just beginning.

00:16:54.850 --> 00:17:03.299
They've had good results in these villages before.

00:17:03.299 --> 00:17:07.299
This is Sarah from a village further north.

00:17:07.299 --> 00:17:12.299
She wanted to study, but she left too far away for a regular visit.

00:17:12.299 --> 00:17:16.299
So, a sister in Iluli-Set studied with her over the phone.

00:17:16.299 --> 00:17:28.859
She would tie into the meetings during the long, cold months of winter.

00:17:28.859 --> 00:17:31.859
But she felt that wasn't enough.

00:17:31.859 --> 00:17:35.859
So, she moved some 300 miles to Iluli-Set.

00:17:35.859 --> 00:17:39.859
She remembers the tears at her first meeting.

00:17:39.859 --> 00:17:43.859
Sarah was now with her spiritual family.

00:17:43.859 --> 00:17:49.359
In time, she was baptized.

00:17:49.359 --> 00:17:54.359
The weather and distances make it difficult for the brothers and sisters.

00:17:54.359 --> 00:17:59.359
But they return to these villages year after year.

00:18:00.359 --> 00:18:21.170
Searching for more friends of peace in the vast and isolated regions of Northern Greenland.

00:18:21.170 --> 00:18:23.170
That was fantastic times.

00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:26.170
But it looks like there is a lot of work to do in Greenland.

00:18:26.170 --> 00:18:27.170
Yes, that is.

00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:31.170
And arrangements have been made so that Sarah and other native speakers

00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:36.170
they can tie into the Greenlandic meetings in Luke for some parts of the meeting.

00:18:36.170 --> 00:18:39.170
And besides that, at our meetings in Luke,

00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:44.170
we also use simultaneous translation using headphones and radio.

00:18:44.170 --> 00:18:46.170
So that, whether we speak Danish or Greenlandic,

00:18:46.170 --> 00:18:49.170
you can participate and benefit.

00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:51.170
Wow, that is absolutely amazing.

00:18:51.170 --> 00:18:53.170
How do you say wow in Greenlandic?

00:18:53.170 --> 00:18:56.170
Gar du bin napa.

00:18:56.170 --> 00:19:00.829
I'll leave that for you.

00:19:00.829 --> 00:19:02.829
Thank you very much for being with us, Thomas.

00:19:02.829 --> 00:19:04.829
And again, for you and your wife Penina as well,

00:19:04.829 --> 00:19:06.829
we wish you Jehovah's Blessing in your assignment.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:19.000
Well, so far we've been talking about unity and language.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:23.000
And some of the students have prepared a song that addresses just those themes.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:46.009
So let's enjoy the song that they've prepared to sing to their classmates.

00:19:46.009 --> 00:22:43.750
Beautiful song.

00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:48.750
Song in the 24 languages of the heart of their classmates, but with one voice.

00:22:48.750 --> 00:22:53.750
Let's welcome our next guest, Miraf and Johannes Gorms from Ethiopia.

00:22:53.750 --> 00:23:09.579
I just did the call you Johnny, actually.

00:23:09.579 --> 00:23:12.579
Johnny, you and Miraf have a different assignment.

00:23:12.579 --> 00:23:14.579
Could you explain what your assignment is?

00:23:14.579 --> 00:23:16.579
We are not beta lights.

00:23:16.579 --> 00:23:18.579
We serve in the circuit work.

00:23:18.579 --> 00:23:20.579
But you like beta lights.

00:23:20.579 --> 00:23:24.019
Like.

00:23:24.019 --> 00:23:28.460
So what is the circuit work like in Ethiopia?

00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:30.460
What are the people in Ethiopia like?

00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:38.460
The two pen people are generally kind, warm and hospitable, open to talking.

00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:42.460
Most of are religious people.

00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:47.460
It is easy to start conversation because they love spiritual matters.

00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:48.460
Okay.

00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:50.460
Is there maybe one experience?

00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:53.460
One special experience that stands out to you?

00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:58.460
We were assigned a circuit in southern part of Ethiopia.

00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:00.460
The two special panors.

00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:06.460
They serve, they are one of them, ask me if I would go with him.

00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:09.460
He makes written visit.

00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:11.460
Two years ago, he met this man.

00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:16.460
Now, he wants to go back again.

00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:18.460
Wait, so this is after two years.

00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:19.460
He had a nice call.

00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:20.460
He studied with people there.

00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:23.460
And now, two years later, he wants to go back.

00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:24.460
So why did he wait so long?

00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:26.460
Because it was too remote.

00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:27.460
How remote was it?

00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:32.460
It takes three days from nearby city to get there.

00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:37.460
We started by bus and we arrived one small city.

00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:41.460
Then we took a truck seven or nine hours.

00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:46.460
Sometimes, we spent all the night.

00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:48.460
So, sleeping on the road.

00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:49.460
Okay, there is a picture.

00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:51.460
That I slept well.

00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:57.349
So, I presume you took a truck because there was no more buses.

00:24:57.349 --> 00:24:59.349
So, the buses then take the truck.

00:24:59.349 --> 00:25:01.349
After the truck, you walked?

00:25:01.349 --> 00:25:03.349
I walked the rest of the way.

00:25:03.349 --> 00:25:05.349
Short walk?

00:25:05.349 --> 00:25:08.349
It depends what you call short.

00:25:08.349 --> 00:25:13.349
If eleven hour is short to you, then yes.

00:25:13.349 --> 00:25:17.819
Eleven hours.

00:25:17.819 --> 00:25:22.819
So, what was it like walking eleven hours to this village?

00:25:22.819 --> 00:25:26.819
When we walked in the jungle, I got scared.

00:25:26.819 --> 00:25:33.819
I was thinking, if something happened here, how could I out this jungle?

00:25:33.819 --> 00:25:34.819
How could you get out?

00:25:34.819 --> 00:25:35.819
How could you get out?

00:25:35.819 --> 00:25:36.819
Yeah.

00:25:36.819 --> 00:25:41.819
So, I prayed immediately, my thoughts changed.

00:25:41.819 --> 00:25:45.819
From here to the wilderness, I was thinking, this is privilege.

00:25:45.819 --> 00:25:47.819
Like a couple steps.

00:25:47.819 --> 00:25:48.819
Interesting.

00:25:48.819 --> 00:25:50.819
Number half, you're not with Johannes.

00:25:50.819 --> 00:25:53.819
So, what are you thinking while he's gone?

00:25:53.819 --> 00:25:55.819
I mean, this is three days already. He's gone.

00:25:55.819 --> 00:25:57.819
That was the hardest part of my life.

00:25:57.819 --> 00:26:00.819
Because there was no network to contact him.

00:26:00.819 --> 00:26:03.819
I don't know whether he's alive, wound or lost.

00:26:03.819 --> 00:26:05.819
I have no idea.

00:26:05.819 --> 00:26:07.819
And we were in a circuit visit.

00:26:07.819 --> 00:26:11.819
So, I should look strong in front of others.

00:26:11.819 --> 00:26:13.819
So, I couldn't say anything.

00:26:13.819 --> 00:26:15.819
So, I was praying and crying.

00:26:15.819 --> 00:26:17.819
Alone.

00:26:17.819 --> 00:26:21.819
So, you reached the village after your eleven hour walk.

00:26:21.819 --> 00:26:23.819
You found the interested person?

00:26:23.819 --> 00:26:27.819
He had another Bible defense.

00:26:27.819 --> 00:26:30.819
The interested person has Bible students.

00:26:30.819 --> 00:26:32.819
How long did you stay?

00:26:32.819 --> 00:26:37.819
The plan was one or two days to spend them, but I couldn't.

00:26:37.819 --> 00:26:38.819
Because of the interest you couldn't leave?

00:26:38.819 --> 00:26:39.819
Yeah.

00:26:39.819 --> 00:26:43.819
Because two things, the first thing, they are very interested.

00:26:43.819 --> 00:26:46.819
So, I had to stay there.

00:26:46.819 --> 00:26:51.819
The other things, our legs wound.

00:26:51.819 --> 00:26:52.819
Like wood.

00:26:52.819 --> 00:26:54.819
Yeah.

00:26:54.819 --> 00:26:56.819
From eleven hours of walking.

00:26:56.819 --> 00:27:00.819
But when we arrived there,

00:27:00.819 --> 00:27:02.819
we became strong.

00:27:02.819 --> 00:27:04.819
Our tired is elected.

00:27:04.819 --> 00:27:08.819
Because the interested person very enjoyed that conversation.

00:27:08.819 --> 00:27:10.819
When did you leave the village?

00:27:10.819 --> 00:27:13.819
Sunday, Sunday morning.

00:27:13.819 --> 00:27:15.819
Your legs were feeling better?

00:27:15.819 --> 00:27:16.819
Yeah.

00:27:16.819 --> 00:27:18.819
It's been nine hours.

00:27:18.819 --> 00:27:21.819
We have got one area.

00:27:21.819 --> 00:27:24.819
We have got a telephone.

00:27:24.819 --> 00:27:26.819
So, I can't call her.

00:27:26.819 --> 00:27:29.819
So, you walked nine hours to get to a telephone.

00:27:29.819 --> 00:27:32.819
What was that phone call like, Muraf?

00:27:32.819 --> 00:27:35.819
As I told you, I wanted to cry because I was so worried.

00:27:35.819 --> 00:27:38.819
And he called and said my name.

00:27:38.819 --> 00:27:41.819
So, I was so happy and I started to cry.

00:27:41.819 --> 00:27:43.819
What's happened since then?

00:27:43.819 --> 00:27:46.819
After that visit, do you know what's happened to them?

00:27:46.819 --> 00:27:48.819
Most of them now.

00:27:48.819 --> 00:27:52.819
They have got baptized recently.

00:27:52.819 --> 00:27:56.819
One circuit overseer and one special painter, David Zim.

00:27:56.819 --> 00:27:58.819
I have a video.

00:27:58.819 --> 00:27:59.819
Maybe.

00:27:59.819 --> 00:28:01.819
Would you like to see them?

00:28:01.819 --> 00:28:02.819
No, maybe.

00:28:02.819 --> 00:28:05.819
Let's have a look at the video, please.

00:28:05.819 --> 00:28:09.819
Our journey begins here in Sorddo.

00:28:09.819 --> 00:28:13.819
Sorddo has a striving, umhari congregation

00:28:13.819 --> 00:28:16.819
and three congregations in Olaith.

00:28:16.819 --> 00:28:19.819
And yet, the brothers travel to support

00:28:19.819 --> 00:28:22.819
the search even in village far away.

00:28:22.819 --> 00:28:27.819
Today, their destination is a small village of Salish.

00:28:27.819 --> 00:28:31.819
The journey is long, but the brothers settle in

00:28:31.819 --> 00:28:40.170
and enjoy the beautiful countryside.

00:28:40.170 --> 00:28:47.500
The first stop is Saula, where our brothers and sisters

00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:49.500
are waiting for them.

00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:53.500
This is the end of the line for the bus ride.

00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:58.500
Oh nice, it will be to have a good night's rest.

00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:01.500
It is time to start walking.

00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:09.819
Unless you can catch a ride on one of these.

00:29:09.819 --> 00:29:15.819
Today, they cross valleys, mountains, and rivers.

00:29:15.819 --> 00:29:19.819
Some small and some not so small.

00:29:19.819 --> 00:29:23.819
Here the brothers have to wait through the rivers first,

00:29:23.819 --> 00:29:27.819
then the drivers bring the motorbikes across.

00:29:27.819 --> 00:29:31.819
I wish I had this option on my first trip.

00:29:35.250 --> 00:29:39.250
One more stop, time for a delicious meal in Laha

00:29:39.250 --> 00:29:41.250
with the local brothers.

00:29:41.250 --> 00:29:51.259
I can still smell the fresh roasted coffee.

00:29:51.259 --> 00:29:54.259
Finally, they make it to Salish.

00:29:54.259 --> 00:29:58.259
How I miss these brothers and sisters.

00:29:58.259 --> 00:30:03.259
I met this brother, here say go, on my first visit.

00:30:03.259 --> 00:30:13.279
There are ten publishers now in Salish.

00:30:13.279 --> 00:30:18.279
They conduct 24 Bible studies and many are attending the meetings.

00:30:18.279 --> 00:30:24.279
To think, this all started with just one interested person.

00:30:24.279 --> 00:30:29.279
How do our brothers feel to be part of Garth's organization?

00:30:29.279 --> 00:30:34.279
Jehovah loved us, because of his love, he drew us to him.

00:30:34.279 --> 00:30:37.279
He made us a part of the international brotherhood.

00:30:37.279 --> 00:30:41.279
We are very happy and we thank Jehovah.

00:30:41.279 --> 00:30:44.279
We thank him from our heart.

00:30:44.279 --> 00:30:47.279
And I am thankful to Jehovah.

00:30:47.279 --> 00:30:52.279
Zaki included these dear friends to join him in the search for more.

00:30:52.279 --> 00:31:07.000
You must be very happy to see those faces.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:12.000
This thinking about that trip, when you were out there walking in the jungle,

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:16.000
going all that way, what did you learn from that?

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:21.000
I saw Jehovah's hand during that difficult trip.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:24.000
Jehovah cared me.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:27.000
We didn't fear, because we saw Jehovah's hand.

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:30.000
We felt we are in Jehovah's hand.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.000
Beautiful. What about you, Muraf, waiting alone,

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:35.000
not knowing what was happening to you, Hanna?

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:38.000
What did you learn from that experience?

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:43.000
At that time, I was thinking, I know that Jehovah can protect him.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:47.000
So I was stilling myself this, and that kept me strong.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:50.000
Doing Jehovah's will, Jehovah can protect him.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.000
You're Hanna and Muraf, thank you so much for your experiences

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.000
and being with us on the Inside Story.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.000
Thank you.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:03.160
Every one of the students has a story.

00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:07.160
You have a story, and maybe one day we'll all get to hear them.

00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:10.160
But for today, we've just scratched the surface.

00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:14.160
It's been so encouraging to see the lengths that our brothers and sisters will go

00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:18.160
to find friends of peace, and it has been very touching to hear

00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:23.160
the lengths that Jehovah will go to find his little sheep to bring them back.

00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:27.160
We look forward to seeing you again another episode of The Inside Story,

00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:30.160
and that's all for this time from the 145th class.

00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:34.910
Thank you.

00:32:34.910 --> 00:32:54.940
Well, we'd like to thank all those involved with producing The Inside Story.

00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:57.940
It truly was appreciated by each one of us.
