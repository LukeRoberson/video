00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:14.099
There were a few factors that created the need at Bethel for a more structured training program.

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.100
One of those factors included the regular change over in personnel.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.100
The brothers have to be more versatile in their assignments. They may have to do tasks.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.100
They previously weren't trained on.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.100
Printing equipment became more technologically advanced.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.100
Our building systems became more complicated.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:37.100
Computer systems were now starting to be used to control virtually everything.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:43.100
I feel like Bethel has definitely always been good about training, but especially now,

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:49.100
I think everyone sees the need to continue investing in the brothers and sisters that are currently at Bethel.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:55.100
I don't think it's possible for someone to know less about the traits than I did when I started.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:00.100
I remember my first reaction when I was invited to help in the electrical was fear.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:07.099
So when I received my assignment, I found out that it involved running the heavy equipment.

00:01:07.099 --> 00:01:10.099
So I called my parents. I was really excited about it.

00:01:10.099 --> 00:01:16.099
I said, Mom and Dad, I guess what I get to do? And Dad says, okay, son, will.

00:01:16.099 --> 00:01:19.099
Did you tell them that you don't know how to drive?

00:01:19.099 --> 00:01:28.099
It was decided to pull a group of highly experienced, highly skilled brothers to concentrate on developing and teaching

00:01:28.099 --> 00:01:35.099
repeatable, consistent classes that could bring people skill levels up to what was needed.

00:01:35.099 --> 00:01:39.099
We teach well over 100 different classes in 12 major categories.

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:44.099
Here at Bethel, I've probably been a part of over 30 different classes.

00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:49.099
So it's been a variety depending on the needs at the time of the assignment.

00:01:49.099 --> 00:01:54.099
I would estimate that I've taken about 15 or 20 different courses from safety and training

00:01:54.099 --> 00:01:57.099
over the course of my 13 years in learning a trade.

00:01:57.099 --> 00:02:01.099
I've become certified and at least these seven different license requirements.

00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:06.099
We teach people technical skills, but that's not the sole purpose of the training.

00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:10.099
If you aren't skilled in safety, you can't be skilled in your trade and vice versa.

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:19.099
The objective in all of our safety courses is to get them to view safety the same way Jehovah views it as a reflection of their spirituality.

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:22.099
So training and safety is essential.

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:27.099
So our goal is to take them into the classroom, give them some time to consider the theoretical,

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:31.099
and then we take them out where there's a lab setup and we have them do some tests on it.

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:39.099
Typically they will tell us that they've been able to learn more in a week than what they have learned in a year of trade school.

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:43.099
We've done over 60,000 instances of training.

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:51.099
And so now receiving this training, it provides an area or an aspect in which I can give my 100% to Jehovah.

00:02:51.099 --> 00:03:01.099
You see it in their eyes are just so happy that they now have maybe a new skill or a new understanding that they can use to benefit Jehovah.

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:05.099
I love the fact that I came into Bethel with virtually no experience.

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:12.099
And not only did I receive a trade that I could use to carry out a work that glorifies Jehovah,

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:17.099
but I was trained well enough that I can share it with others and they can be trained too.

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:28.099
Helping someone else to go from that feeling of not knowing anything to feeling productive and feeling like they're contributing is a real joy for me.

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:31.099
And they can take what they learn wherever they go.

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:36.099
The confidence that people leave with once they've received that investment,

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:40.099
it's confidence that they can carry out whatever assignment Jehovah has given them,

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:44.099
and the confidence that Jehovah is going to train them for whatever's being asked of them.

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:51.099
I think if younger brothers and sisters are trying to learn a skill so that they can come to Bethel, that's commendable.

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:55.099
But more importantly a spirituality, let Jehovah finish your training.

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:58.099
In regard to training, we're really only getting started.

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:02.099
The training that we are getting in this system of things by Jehovah,

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:08.099
and especially related to safety, is absolutely going to be vital in the new world.

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:12.099
I can imagine the idea of being able to use some of the things I've learned

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:16.100
to figure out how we can use the natural resources in a way without using them up.

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.100
We know that we serve a God who is known as the Grand Instructor.

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.100
So the things that we're teaching and training right now,

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.100
it can only expand in the future.

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:30.100
And as long as you let him train you, you're going to be all right.
