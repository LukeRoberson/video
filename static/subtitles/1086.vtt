00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.740
Our disciple-making work is a weighty assignment from Jehovah.

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.740
But he does not expect us to accomplish it on our own.

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.740
Are you making full use of the help Jehovah provides?

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.739
We know that you will be encouraged by the following three-part symposium.

00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:22.739
Each speaker will introduce the one to follow.

00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:26.739
But the Robert Serenco, a helper to the writing committee,

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:28.739
will deliver the first talk entitled,

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:31.739
Experience the Joy of Disciple-Making.

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:33.740
Accept Jehovah's help.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:35.740
Research tools.

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:46.369
But Serenco, you have our full attention.

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:47.369
What would you say?

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:51.369
How important is the disciple-making work?

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:56.369
Well, it is so important that Jehovah God is directly involved in it.

00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:57.369
How do we know?

00:00:57.369 --> 00:01:02.369
Turn in your Bibles, please, to 1 Corinthians chapter 3, verse 9.

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:05.370
1 Corinthians 3, 9.

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:09.370
It says, for we are God's fellow workers.

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:14.370
You are God's field under cultivation, God's building.

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:19.370
Just think what a privilege we have to share with the Almighty Creator of the Universe

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:23.370
and work that he considers so important here on Earth.

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:31.370
He allows us to experience the joy of helping to build people into disciples of Jesus Christ.

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:35.370
We know from the verses that come just before verse 9 that,

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:40.370
While we plant and water seeds of kingdom truth in the hearts of interested ones,

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:44.370
Jehovah is the one who makes those seeds grow.

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:49.370
However, knowing this should not minimize in our minds the importance of our part

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:51.370
in the disciple-making work.

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:58.370
What we do and how we do it has an impact on how those seeds of truth will grow.

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:02.370
And Jehovah knows that the more skilled we become at making disciples,

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:08.370
the more effective we will be as his fellow workers and the more enjoyable the work will be for us.

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:13.370
To that end, Jehovah equips us to teach as effectively as possible.

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:19.370
All we have to do is accept his help, and that is what this symposium is all about.

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.370
Learning to benefit from the research tools Jehovah has given us,

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:29.370
the help that is available from our brothers and the power of prayer.

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.370
Each talk in the symposium will consider two questions.

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.370
First, what help has Jehovah given us?

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:43.370
And second, how can we use that help to increase our joy in the ministry?

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.370
Let's start by talking about research tools.

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.370
What help is Jehovah given us?

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.370
He has given us the right tools, the best tools for our work.

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:00.370
For most of all, he has dignified us by allowing us to use his written word the Bible,

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.370
and that is our most important tool for the ministry.

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:09.370
Turn to 2 Timothy 3, verses 16 and 17.

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.370
2 Timothy 3, 16 and 17.

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:19.370
It says, all scripture is inspired of God and beneficial for teaching,

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:24.370
for reproving, for setting things straight, for disciplining and righteousness,

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:29.370
so that the man of God or woman of God may be fully competent,

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:34.740
completely equipped for every good work.

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:43.740
We should want to do all we can to keep honing our skills in using the Bible to teach the truth about God, Christ, and the Kingdom.

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:50.740
And the beauty of using the Bible is that the message contained in it can literally change people.

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:56.740
Religious falsehoods and erroneous ideas have become strongly entrenched in the minds of sincere people,

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:03.740
but the Bible, when used effectively, can overturn those wrong beliefs.

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:08.740
Why the Bible can even help a person understand his own deepest thoughts and feelings?

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:19.740
One Bible translation renders that 16th verse by saying the Bible is useful for resetting the direction of a man's life.

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:26.740
Through our own study of the Bible, we can become skilled at using the scriptures in the ministry.

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:34.740
And to help us succeed in this, Jehovah has given us a variety of research tools to use in personal study and family worship.

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:45.740
These include the Watchtower Library, the JW Library App, the Watchtower Online Library, and the Research Guide.

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:53.740
Jehovah wants us to be skillful in using the tools he has provided so that the proverb will come true for us that says,

00:04:53.740 --> 00:05:00.740
have you seen a man skillful at his work? He will stand before kings.

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:08.740
As you watch the following dramatization, notice what comes up on Nita's Bible study that challenges her as a teacher,

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:20.149
how she realizes she needs help to teach effectively, and what research tool she uses to prepare for her study with Jade.

00:05:20.149 --> 00:05:26.149
I'm making a friend with God. Yeah, I don't know how to do that.

00:05:26.149 --> 00:05:35.149
I can make a friend, but you've done fine with me. But I can see you. But God, a friend? Seriously?

00:05:35.149 --> 00:05:47.149
How about what you can see? What does creation teach us about him? Not much. Maybe evolve or your species dies? It doesn't really help.

00:05:47.149 --> 00:05:54.149
Well, I'm not talking about evolution. I'm talking about the things that God created.

00:05:54.149 --> 00:05:59.149
You know, it's probably just got a little workshop up there building things one at a time, do you?

00:05:59.149 --> 00:06:07.149
In the real world, things evolve. It's all random. I don't know what that tells me about him.

00:06:07.149 --> 00:06:27.740
I wasn't ready for this. Evolution isn't my strong suit. I need help. This could be good.

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:37.740
Many who believe evolution, ancient tidal pool chemicals spontaneously assembled too deep.

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:50.740
Wait, maybe what does the evidence reveal? For a cell to survive DNA, RNA, inanimate chemicals, probability,

00:06:50.740 --> 00:07:01.740
I'm not sure this is what she needs. Her real issue was getting to know someone she can't see. Maybe that's the best place to begin.

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:17.879
One widespread false teaching rubs people of hope, implies that human life has no purpose.

00:07:17.879 --> 00:07:28.879
This could be it. Establish the positive. What creation really says about Jehovah versus whatever evolution obscures.

00:07:28.879 --> 00:07:33.879
Okay, so you got me thinking and I did some research.

00:07:33.879 --> 00:07:39.879
And I think you'll really like what I found. Come on, comes it down.

00:07:39.879 --> 00:08:01.420
Did you see where need a turn for help? The research guide.

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:11.420
With a little bit of searching and persistence, she found what she needed. She got excited about the information and passed that excitement on to her student.

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:20.990
How can you use our research tools effectively? You can use them to help you explain and teach the scriptures.

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:30.990
For example, as with Jade, your students may be struggling to understand a scriptural teaching. Or you may have a student who is trying to overcome a personal problem.

00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:38.990
Use the tools Jehovah has given us to search for an explanation or an illustration that will help the person.

00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:50.990
And you may not even have to do all the work yourself. Perhaps you can show your students how to use our tools in order to find the Bible's answers to their questions.

00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:55.990
Do your best, though, to learn how to use our research tools.

00:08:55.990 --> 00:09:03.990
Likely, you already use JW Library for personal study and family worship and to prepare for congregation meetings.

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:12.990
But if you keep up to date with new features in the JW Library app, you can also use it to good advantage in your ministry.

00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:22.990
There are even features built into the app that make it possible for you to save the research that you have done so you can use it again in the future.

00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:33.990
What are those features? Notes and tags. Notes and tags. If you learn how to use them, well, now you can.

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:46.990
If you have JW Library with you on a device, open the Bible to 1 Timothy chapter 2, 1 Timothy chapter 2, and follow along with this tutorial video.

00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:56.620
Are you making full use of JW Library? Let's learn how some are using it and then practice together.

00:09:56.620 --> 00:10:02.620
I create notes in my Bible for many different reasons. It could be a good point from a talk.

00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:09.620
An illustration to help me explain something to a Bible student or something from my own meditation.

00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:13.620
I highlight the key phrase and create a note.

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:21.620
Let's practice together. If you have JW Library, find 1 Timothy 2 verse 6 in the Bible.

00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:39.159
Now highlight the word ransom and tap the add a note button. Then type your comment.

00:10:39.159 --> 00:10:44.159
Tapping the note marker in the margin brings your comment into view.

00:10:44.159 --> 00:10:54.159
I've created a lot of notes. I use tags to help me find them again. For example, whenever I hear a point that I want to use in the ministry,

00:10:54.159 --> 00:11:05.159
I create a note and add a tag like prayer, ransom, or last days. Then when I'm in the ministry, I can quickly find my note.

00:11:05.159 --> 00:11:16.950
Let's practice together. On the note you just created, tap the three dots and then edit.

00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:37.750
Now tap the button, add a tag, and enter a tag name. In this case, type ransom. You can add as many tags as you like.

00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:48.750
To find your notes again, go to the personal study tab. You can type in the search box or you can just tap the tag.

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:56.750
As I read the Bible chapters for the midweek meeting, I often come across verses that I want to understand better, so I check the research guide.

00:11:56.750 --> 00:12:00.750
Sometimes I use the points I find in a comment at the meeting.

00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:06.750
Let's practice together. Are you still at first Timothy chapter 2?

00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:21.139
Tap on the number for verse 6. Then tap the research guide button on the menu. Now you can read information that explains this verse.

00:12:22.139 --> 00:12:27.139
You can even copy a portion of the research and paste it into your note.

00:12:27.139 --> 00:12:36.370
If you were like me, you will probably have to watch that video a few more times.

00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:42.370
If you find it challenging to learn how to use some of the features of our tools, here are two things you can do.

00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:49.370
First, ask someone in your congregation to assist you, and often the young people can help the most.

00:12:50.370 --> 00:13:04.679
Second, go to JW.org, scroll to the bottom of any page, click on JW Library, and there you will find more tutorial videos that you can watch.

00:13:04.679 --> 00:13:12.679
As announced at the 2018 annual meeting, our research tools are being redesigned to be unified and more user friendly.

00:13:12.679 --> 00:13:16.679
Be sure to learn the new features as they are released.

00:13:16.679 --> 00:13:25.679
And may you joyfully work with Jehovah by using the research tools he has provided for making disciples.

00:13:25.679 --> 00:13:31.679
Brother Joel Dalinger, a helper to the service committee will now present the next talk of the symposium.

00:13:31.679 --> 00:13:37.679
Experience the joy of disciples making, accept Jehovah's help, our brothers.

00:13:45.049 --> 00:13:54.049
The Bible identifies a second source of help that Jehovah has given us so that we can experience the joy of making disciples.

00:13:54.049 --> 00:13:58.049
That gift is described at 1 Peter, chapter 5, and verse 9.

00:13:58.049 --> 00:14:00.049
Please read that with me.

00:14:00.049 --> 00:14:05.419
1 Peter, chapter 5, and verse 9.

00:14:05.419 --> 00:14:19.419
But take your stand against him, firm in the faith, knowing that the same kind of sufferings are being experienced by the entire association of your brothers in the world.

00:14:19.419 --> 00:14:26.419
What hope has Jehovah given us? It's our worldwide association of brothers and sisters.

00:14:26.419 --> 00:14:34.419
Just as their example can help us to endure, our brothers can also help us meet the challenges in the ministry.

00:14:34.419 --> 00:14:44.419
Yes, Jehovah has given us a large spiritual family, and that shows that he wants us to experience the joy of working together.

00:14:44.419 --> 00:14:53.419
Now, we might be thinking, that's encouraging, but is it realistic to think that I can experience the joy of making a disciple?

00:14:53.419 --> 00:14:59.419
Perhaps you've had Bible studies, but none of them have yet progressed to the point of dedication and baptism.

00:14:59.419 --> 00:15:03.419
So you might wonder, am I really up to that challenge?

00:15:03.419 --> 00:15:16.419
Or maybe you're a parent who's newer in the truth, and you're thinking to yourself, how can I reach my child's heart and help him or her learn to love Jehovah as I do?

00:15:16.419 --> 00:15:26.419
Or maybe you're dealing with poor health, or the effects of old age, and you wonder, can I have an effective ministry?

00:15:26.419 --> 00:15:36.419
Brothers and sisters, we want you to take heart. Jehovah has provided help, and help may be near than you think.

00:15:36.419 --> 00:15:44.419
To highlight the help that Jehovah gives to all of us for a few moments, let's consider the Apostle Paul's experience.

00:15:44.419 --> 00:15:48.419
When we think of the Apostle Paul, what comes to mind?

00:15:48.419 --> 00:15:55.419
Perhaps a very hard-working, energetic brother who traveled extensively as a missionary.

00:15:55.419 --> 00:16:00.419
And can there be any doubt that Paul's ministry was a complete success?

00:16:00.419 --> 00:16:07.419
But was Paul's success the result of his efforts alone?

00:16:07.419 --> 00:16:12.419
No. Paul needed and humbly accepted help from others.

00:16:12.419 --> 00:16:20.419
For example, you may recall reading in Acts 16 and 17, how the man Silas traveled with Paul.

00:16:20.419 --> 00:16:30.419
On that trip in the city of Philippi, Paul and Silas shared the joy of helping an entire family become baptized disciples.

00:16:30.419 --> 00:16:34.419
Now there's something very interesting in the Bible's record of that account.

00:16:34.419 --> 00:16:39.419
Every time Paul is mentioned, Silas is mentioned as well.

00:16:39.419 --> 00:16:46.419
In fact, the expression Paul and Silas occurs six times in quick succession.

00:16:46.419 --> 00:16:53.419
Well, what do we learn from that? Clearly, Paul had help in his ministry. He did not go it alone.

00:16:53.419 --> 00:16:56.419
Now, young ones, a question for you.

00:16:56.419 --> 00:17:02.419
Can you think of another close friend of Paul who often traveled with him?

00:17:03.419 --> 00:17:11.420
You got it right. Timothy. For about 14 years, the two of them worked together in Jehovah's service.

00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:19.420
Now, did Paul, the more experienced man, really view Timothy as a helper as someone who could assist him?

00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:27.420
Yes, he did. As Paul neared the end of his life, for example, he wrote to Timothy, his younger friend, and said,

00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:31.420
Do your utmost to come to me shortly.

00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:36.420
Paul was not too proud to ask for help.

00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:46.420
In Acts chapter 18, the Bible tells us about a married couple, Aquila and his wife Priscilla, or Priska, who supported Paul.

00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:54.420
In the city of Corinth, they welcomed Paul not only into their home, but also into the business of making tents.

00:17:54.420 --> 00:18:01.420
Now, can you imagine how much joy these three must have had as they worked together?

00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:08.420
Not only in the secular trade of making tents, but also in advancing the kingdom good news?

00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:13.420
Now, when Paul left Corinth, do you know what happened with Aquila and Priscilla?

00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:22.420
They followed him to Ephesus. Their Aquila and Priscilla used their home as a meeting place for the local congregation.

00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:31.420
Their helpful services continued. In Acts chapter 18, at verse 24, we learned that this couple became acquainted with Apollas.

00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:41.420
A Christian from Egypt, who, according to the scriptural account, was an eloquent man and well versed in the scriptures.

00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:48.420
Even so, Apollas needed some help because he had some gaps in his understanding.

00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:52.420
So what did helpful Priscilla and Aquila do?

00:18:52.420 --> 00:19:02.420
Acts chapter 18 verse 26 tells us they took Apollas into their company and explained the way of God more accurately to him.

00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:10.420
Now, think of that for a moment. This humble couple, tent makers, were not intimidated by Apollas.

00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:20.420
To them, he was a brother, a part of the family, and out of brotherly love, they took the initiative to give him the help that he needed.

00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:28.420
Well, in thinking about Paul and how he viewed those that assisted him, how do you think he felt about this beautiful couple?

00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:37.420
Please open your Bible with me to Paul's own words that Jehovah preserved in Romans chapter 16 verses 3 and 4.

00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:44.420
Let's Romans chapter 16 verses 3 and 4. Let's read it together.

00:19:44.420 --> 00:20:01.420
Give my greetings to Priska or Priscilla and Aquila, my fellow workers in Christ Jesus, who have risked their own next for me, and to whom not only I, but also all the congregations of the nations, give thanks.

00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:10.420
Deep appreciation is what Paul felt for this loyal couple. He viewed them as his fellow workers.

00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:23.420
Now, what does all of that we've discussed? Tell us about the Apostle Paul. Clearly, the success he enjoyed in his ministry was not the result of his efforts alone.

00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:33.420
Jehovah gave Paul the help he needed to have an effective ministry, and that help came in the form of many brothers and sisters.

00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:41.420
Dear brothers and sisters, Jehovah has given you and given me the same help, our brothers.

00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:47.420
In the following dramatization, please notice how Anita benefits from the help of another sister.

00:20:47.420 --> 00:21:01.750
I've tried everything to get day two in meeting.

00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:08.700
It's every Saturday and Sunday, and I think you drew the intro here.

00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:11.700
I can't promise anything.

00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:24.680
It would be nice if you could come.

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:33.359
Absolutely. Have you tried bringing other people on the study?

00:21:33.359 --> 00:21:40.660
Well, maybe not everything. What are you doing tomorrow after me?

00:21:40.660 --> 00:22:17.609
I'm since I hear them.

00:22:17.609 --> 00:22:18.609
You know that band?

00:22:19.609 --> 00:22:25.609
Know them. I used to see them all the time before I'm a witness.

00:22:25.609 --> 00:22:27.609
No way. You like that kind of music.

00:22:27.609 --> 00:22:42.640
You don't believe me? Anything.

00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:44.640
Happy gay?

00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:54.609
I was young.

00:22:54.609 --> 00:23:11.750
You were in a band. We have that vinyl.

00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:16.750
So, I'll be gone next week, but I'll have someone else take care of the study.

00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:53.619
Did you notice how Anita responded to the suggestion that was given her?

00:23:53.619 --> 00:23:58.619
Applying that council brought good results.

00:23:58.619 --> 00:24:04.619
Like Anita, we may need specific help to accomplish our ministry fully.

00:24:04.619 --> 00:24:09.619
For example, when it comes to making return visits and conducting Bible studies,

00:24:09.619 --> 00:24:15.619
could some brothers and sisters in your congregation help you to improve your skills?

00:24:16.619 --> 00:24:23.619
Like all of us would benefit by reaching out to such publishers who have gained experience

00:24:23.619 --> 00:24:27.619
and skill in those aspects of the ministry.

00:24:27.619 --> 00:24:32.619
What if you're a parent who wants to instill love for Jehovah in the heart of your child?

00:24:32.619 --> 00:24:37.619
How about asking some other parents or grandparents for advice?

00:24:37.619 --> 00:24:43.619
If they've had success raising their children to love Jehovah and become baptized disciples,

00:24:43.619 --> 00:24:48.619
they will certainly be happy to share their experience with you.

00:24:48.619 --> 00:24:53.619
And what if we have age, limitations, or health concerns?

00:24:53.619 --> 00:24:58.619
We may need practical assistance that accommodates our needs.

00:24:58.619 --> 00:25:04.619
For example, at many Bethel homes, elderly and infirm brothers and sisters are still having a regular

00:25:04.619 --> 00:25:08.619
and productive share in the ministry. Do you know how?

00:25:08.619 --> 00:25:16.619
Elders at Bethel arranged for younger publishers to join the elderly ones in letter writing and phone witnessing.

00:25:16.619 --> 00:25:21.619
One sister by the name of Nancy, who was nearly 90 years old at the time, said this.

00:25:21.619 --> 00:25:30.619
I don't view letter writing as just stuffing envelopes. This is field service. People need to know the truth.

00:25:30.619 --> 00:25:34.619
How encouraging. And did you know that in less than a year,

00:25:34.619 --> 00:25:40.619
one group of precious older ones devoted over 1,000 hours to the ministry,

00:25:40.619 --> 00:25:48.619
wrote over 6,000 letters, made over 2,000 phone calls and placed over 6,000 pieces of literature?

00:25:48.619 --> 00:25:55.619
What good was accomplished by working together and what joy they experienced?

00:25:55.619 --> 00:26:03.619
Of course, we have to admit that it takes humility to acknowledge that we need help.

00:26:03.619 --> 00:26:06.619
But in this we can learn from Apollos.

00:26:06.619 --> 00:26:12.619
Though eloquent, though well versed in the Scriptures, he accepted the help that he needed.

00:26:12.619 --> 00:26:18.619
As a result, he benefited and all those that he would teach thereafter benefited.

00:26:18.619 --> 00:26:20.619
So here's the point.

00:26:20.619 --> 00:26:28.619
Can you think of someone, like Priscilla or Aquila, who could give you the help you need?

00:26:28.619 --> 00:26:37.619
If so, why not explain your needs and ask that person to join you in the ministry or on Bible studies?

00:26:37.619 --> 00:26:43.619
Now, if you've been serving Jehovah for a time, are you in a position to help others?

00:26:43.619 --> 00:26:49.619
If so, we encourage you to be observant. Take the initiative to offer assistance.

00:26:49.619 --> 00:26:55.619
If you see that a brother or sister would benefit from a kind suggestion, don't hold back.

00:26:56.619 --> 00:27:01.619
At an appropriate time, you might begin the conversation in a friendly way by saying,

00:27:01.619 --> 00:27:06.619
may I offer you a suggestion? Or, here's what I try to do.

00:27:06.619 --> 00:27:13.619
Remember, if we're kind and thoughtful, like Aquila and Priscilla, likely our words and example

00:27:13.619 --> 00:27:19.619
will prove to be a blessing to help our brothers find joy in making disciples too.

00:27:19.619 --> 00:27:24.619
Well, in the second part of this symposium, what have we learned?

00:27:24.619 --> 00:27:30.619
First, our brothers are a gift from Jehovah to help us make disciples.

00:27:30.619 --> 00:27:40.619
And second, when we work together and support one another, all of us can find great joy in our precious ministry.

00:27:40.619 --> 00:27:47.619
Now, Brother Garrett Loesch, a member of the governing body will consider the third and final talk of this symposium,

00:27:48.619 --> 00:28:00.900
experience the joy of disciples making, except Jehovah's help prayer.

00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:07.900
Help! No doubt you have sometimes in your life heard somebody call out, help!

00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:12.900
Perhaps you yourself have called out, help to Jehovah.

00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:15.900
In Psalm 30 verse 10, David once sang,

00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:19.900
old Jehovah, become my helper.

00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:23.900
Jehovah becomes our helper not only when we are in danger.

00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:30.900
He provides help in many positive ways in everyday life.

00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:34.900
What helped us Jehovah provide for us?

00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:40.900
First, find with me a revelation chapter 14 verse 6.

00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:48.900
For one thing, Jehovah provides his holy angels to support the worldwide preaching work.

00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:52.900
In Revelation 146, John recorded.

00:28:52.900 --> 00:29:09.230
And I saw another angel flying in mid-Heaven and he had ever lasting good news to declare to those who dwell on the earth to every nation and tribe and tongue and people.

00:29:09.230 --> 00:29:17.230
It is not just one angel that is active in support of the preaching work, many angels are involved in it.

00:29:17.230 --> 00:29:28.230
If it were not for the help and direction of the angels, we would sometimes overlook somebody with a good heart when we go out and preach.

00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:42.230
Secondly, Jehovah has also given us his holy spirit, the fruitage of which makes us more effective teachers and helps us to draw sheep like ones to the truth.

00:29:42.230 --> 00:29:47.230
Thirdly, Jehovah has given us as help the privilege of prayer.

00:29:47.230 --> 00:29:51.230
He gets personally involved in our activities.

00:29:51.230 --> 00:29:55.230
Bible teachers and students alike need Jehovah's help.

00:29:55.230 --> 00:30:05.230
Psalm 127 verse 1 says, unless Jehovah builds the house, it is in vain that its builders work hard on it.

00:30:05.230 --> 00:30:09.230
Fourth, Jehovah gives us also the needed wisdom.

00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:18.230
It is wisdom to pray for the wisdom from above mentioned at James 3 verse 17.

00:30:18.230 --> 00:30:29.230
Lastly, Jehovah also gives us the needed strength which helps us a lot when we are tired or discouraged or have a lot of work.

00:30:29.230 --> 00:30:36.230
First, Peter 4.11 refers to the strength that God supplies.

00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:43.230
Yes, we can pray for Jehovah's help for wisdom and for the necessary strength.

00:30:43.230 --> 00:30:57.720
In the following dramatization, notice the power of praying in behalf of a Bible student.

00:30:57.720 --> 00:31:06.720
So, how do we know that Jesus did not become king when he was on earth or immediately after he was resurrected?

00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:12.670
Oh, because he didn't.

00:31:12.670 --> 00:31:17.779
Well, what did Jesus teach his disciples to pray?

00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:30.220
Oh, well, I know the obvious, let your kingdom come, implied future tense.

00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:36.319
But how come you know for sure what's going on in heaven?

00:31:36.319 --> 00:31:39.319
Maybe it would help if we reviewed the cited scriptures here.

00:31:39.319 --> 00:31:49.680
Before you leave a suggestion, maybe you were to study ahead of time.

00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:52.680
How about no? I'm really swamped.

00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:54.680
I know you're busy.

00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:55.680
We all are.

00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:57.680
You have no clue, do you?

00:31:57.680 --> 00:31:58.680
I gotta go.

00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:08.750
I didn't know what to do next.

00:32:08.750 --> 00:32:13.750
I thought she was making our study a priority, but maybe she wasn't.

00:32:13.750 --> 00:32:49.200
It do all die time.

00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:56.200
Then, I remembered 1 Corinthians 3 verse 6 that God keeps making a grow.

00:32:56.200 --> 00:33:11.309
So I asked him to help Jade, then left it with him.

00:33:11.309 --> 00:33:38.029
Look, I need to apologize.

00:33:38.029 --> 00:33:41.029
Forget it. You were stressed.

00:33:41.029 --> 00:33:43.029
Yeah, but there's more.

00:33:43.029 --> 00:33:46.029
Inside, I knew you were right.

00:33:46.029 --> 00:33:49.029
It's just the last thing I wanted to stop.

00:33:49.029 --> 00:33:50.029
Really?

00:33:50.029 --> 00:33:55.200
How about I show you how I prepare?

00:33:55.200 --> 00:34:07.779
Okay.

00:34:07.779 --> 00:34:21.190
How can prayer help us in making disciples?

00:34:22.190 --> 00:34:28.190
Please locate with me Philippians 1 verses 9 and 10.

00:34:28.190 --> 00:34:36.860
And this is what I continue praying that your love may abound still more and more

00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:41.860
with accurate knowledge and full discernment.

00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:46.860
That you may make sure of the more important things so that you may be flawless

00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:52.230
and not stumbling others up to the day of Christ.

00:34:52.230 --> 00:34:57.230
Just as Paul prayed that the love of the Philippians may abound

00:34:57.230 --> 00:35:01.230
with accurate knowledge and full discernment, we can pray for the same

00:35:01.230 --> 00:35:04.230
in behalf of our Bible students.

00:35:04.230 --> 00:35:08.230
Pray also for the Holy Spirit to guide your thoughts and actions

00:35:08.230 --> 00:35:11.230
and the ones of your students.

00:35:11.230 --> 00:35:15.230
Pray from the heart, confident that Jehovah will hear you.

00:35:15.230 --> 00:35:18.230
Psalm 65 verse 2 says,

00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:24.230
Oh, hear of prayer to you people of all sorts will come.

00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:29.230
Teach your Bible students how to pray, not only encourage them to do so,

00:35:29.230 --> 00:35:32.230
urge them to do so.

00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:38.230
Learning to pray will help your students to form a close friendship with Jehovah.

00:35:38.230 --> 00:35:45.230
Pray with your Bible students and for them, using or spelling out their name.

00:35:45.230 --> 00:35:50.230
Be confident that Jehovah will answer your prayers and theirs.

00:35:50.230 --> 00:35:55.230
Please turn to Acts 10 verse 9.

00:35:55.230 --> 00:36:02.230
Peter was a fine example of one who prayed.

00:36:02.230 --> 00:36:06.230
Acts 10 verse 9 says,

00:36:06.230 --> 00:36:12.769
The next day as they were continuing on their journey and were approaching the city,

00:36:12.769 --> 00:36:20.559
Peter went up to the house top about the sixth hour to pray.

00:36:20.559 --> 00:36:24.559
In the same chapter Cornelius was also a fine example.

00:36:24.559 --> 00:36:32.320
In Acts chapter 10, 30 and 31, he reported to Peter.

00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:38.320
Four days ago, counting from this hour I was praying in my house at the ninth hour,

00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:42.320
just then a man in bright clothing stood in front of me and said,

00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:52.369
Cornelius, your prayer has been favorably heard and your gifts of mercy have been remembered before God.

00:36:52.369 --> 00:36:57.369
Jehovah answered Peter's prayer and Cornelius prayer.

00:36:57.369 --> 00:37:04.369
Jehovah has given us what we need to increase our joy in making disciples.

00:37:04.369 --> 00:37:08.369
When a report came to John that Jesus was making many disciples,

00:37:08.369 --> 00:37:11.369
John did not become jealous.

00:37:11.369 --> 00:37:14.369
At John chapter 3 he replied,

00:37:14.369 --> 00:37:17.369
This joy of mine has been made full.

00:37:17.369 --> 00:37:23.369
That one must go on increasing but I must go on decreasing.

00:37:23.369 --> 00:37:30.369
When we do not make disciples personally, we can still rejoice with those who do make them.

00:37:30.369 --> 00:37:35.369
The angels rejoice although they do not personally make disciples.

00:37:35.369 --> 00:37:38.369
At Luke 157, Jesus said,

00:37:38.369 --> 00:37:48.369
There will be more joy in heaven or the one sinner who repents than over 99 righteous ones who have no need of repentance.

00:37:48.369 --> 00:37:59.369
We also rejoice because we have the Bible and powerful research tools in print and electronically as well as in audio format.

00:37:59.369 --> 00:38:04.369
We rejoice because we have our brotherhood to support and assist us.

00:38:04.369 --> 00:38:10.369
We can ask them for suggestions and we can invite them to accompany us in the ministry,

00:38:10.369 --> 00:38:15.369
even if it is only by computer, tie-in or telephone witnessing.

00:38:15.369 --> 00:38:19.369
If we cannot meet together physically for a congregation meeting,

00:38:19.369 --> 00:38:24.369
we can arrange for tie-ins with others and here and see them.

00:38:24.369 --> 00:38:27.369
It warms our heart.

00:38:27.369 --> 00:38:32.369
Don't forget the provisions from Jehovah which we mentioned at the beginning of this talk.

00:38:33.369 --> 00:38:37.369
First, we have the privilege of prayer.

00:38:37.369 --> 00:38:40.369
Second, the help of God's angels.

00:38:40.369 --> 00:38:44.369
Third, the support of the Holy Spirit.

00:38:44.369 --> 00:38:47.369
Fourth, the wisdom from above.

00:38:47.369 --> 00:38:53.369
And fifth, the spiritual and emotional strength that God supplies.

00:38:53.369 --> 00:39:00.369
Jehovah has given us all of this because He cares about us and about those we teach.

00:39:00.369 --> 00:39:06.369
We will have great joy in the ministry if we take full advantage of Jehovah's help.

00:39:06.369 --> 00:39:15.369
Lastly, we want to mention something very precious that brings us deep inner joy, some 25-14.

00:39:15.369 --> 00:39:23.369
Close friendship with Jehovah belongs to those who fear Him and pray to Him.

00:39:23.369 --> 00:39:35.940
May your joyous friendship with Jehovah and the joyous friendship with disciples of Jehovah last for an eternity.

00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:41.940
Thank you, brothers, for drawing our attention to the help Jehovah provides.

00:39:41.940 --> 00:39:45.940
The time has now arrived for the baptism discourse.

00:39:45.940 --> 00:39:50.940
We invite all baptism candidates to pay particular attention.

00:39:50.940 --> 00:39:53.940
The day of one's baptism is an especially joyful one.

00:39:53.940 --> 00:39:56.940
But it is also just a beginning.

00:39:56.940 --> 00:40:02.940
How can you candidates for baptism gain even greater joy in the days ahead?

00:40:02.940 --> 00:40:07.940
Listen closely to the answer presented in this discourse entitled,

00:40:07.940 --> 00:40:11.940
How Your Baptism Leads To More Happiness.

00:40:11.940 --> 00:40:16.940
The talk will be given by a help or to the teaching committee, Brother William Malenfont.

00:40:16.940 --> 00:40:28.340
Among the many things that Jesus Christ revealed to His disciples

00:40:28.340 --> 00:40:33.340
was this very old and fundamental truth.

00:40:33.340 --> 00:40:39.340
There is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving.

00:40:39.340 --> 00:40:46.340
Jesus learned this truth from His Father, Jehovah God, who is the greatest example of a happy giver.

00:40:46.340 --> 00:40:53.340
At Genesis 127, we see clear evidence of Jehovah's generosity.

00:40:54.340 --> 00:41:01.340
Genesis 127 says, and God went on to create the man in His image.

00:41:01.340 --> 00:41:09.340
In God's image He created Him, male and female He created them.

00:41:09.340 --> 00:41:18.340
This verse describes humans as a unique creation, different in many ways from all other forms of life on earth.

00:41:18.340 --> 00:41:21.340
We are made in Jehovah's image.

00:41:21.340 --> 00:41:26.340
Jehovah God designed us to reflect His personality.

00:41:26.340 --> 00:41:33.340
We have within us the capability of cultivating the divine quality of generosity

00:41:33.340 --> 00:41:38.340
and to experience the happiness that comes from giving.

00:41:38.340 --> 00:41:45.340
We really do get pleasure out of giving to family, friends, even to people we don't know.

00:41:45.340 --> 00:41:50.340
It makes us feel good to give to others.

00:41:50.340 --> 00:41:57.340
However, the most important giving that we can do and the key to happiness in life

00:41:57.340 --> 00:42:02.340
is to give our Creator what He deserves.

00:42:02.340 --> 00:42:12.340
Revelation 4, verse 11, sets forth clearly the things that Jehovah God deserves

00:42:12.340 --> 00:42:17.340
and it shows the reason why we should give such things to God.

00:42:17.340 --> 00:42:24.340
Read with me. Revelation 4, verse 11, it says,

00:42:24.340 --> 00:42:33.340
You are worthy, Jehovah, our God, to receive the glory and the honor and the power

00:42:33.340 --> 00:42:40.340
because you created all things and because of your will they came into existence

00:42:40.340 --> 00:42:43.340
and were created.

00:42:43.340 --> 00:42:47.340
We exist because Jehovah created us.

00:42:47.340 --> 00:42:55.340
That fact makes Him worthy to receive from us, glory, honor and power.

00:42:55.340 --> 00:43:02.340
That's what you candidates for baptism have made the decision to do, to give Jehovah God,

00:43:02.340 --> 00:43:05.340
glory and honor and power.

00:43:05.340 --> 00:43:12.340
You do this by praising His name, by obeying Him and by using your life,

00:43:12.340 --> 00:43:18.809
your power, energy and your whole strength to do His will.

00:43:18.809 --> 00:43:22.809
By getting baptized in symbol of your dedication to God,

00:43:22.809 --> 00:43:28.809
you are declaring publicly that you have given yourself to Jehovah.

00:43:28.809 --> 00:43:34.809
You have made a gift to God of your heart, mind and strength, your very being.

00:43:34.809 --> 00:43:43.809
And you have made this decision because you have come to know Jehovah and you love Him.

00:43:43.809 --> 00:43:49.809
We are happy to acknowledge your decision to give yourselves to God

00:43:49.809 --> 00:43:54.809
and we wholeheartedly welcome you baptism candidates.

00:43:54.809 --> 00:44:01.599
Giving of yourself in baptism will lead to great happiness

00:44:01.599 --> 00:44:08.599
because it opens up opportunities to give of yourself in ways that truly count.

00:44:08.599 --> 00:44:13.599
Your baptism brings you into a special relationship with Jehovah.

00:44:13.599 --> 00:44:20.599
It allows you to participate in doing His will with His approval because you are obeying Him.

00:44:20.599 --> 00:44:27.599
You become one of Jehovah's witnesses, qualified to present the evidence

00:44:27.599 --> 00:44:34.579
that Jehovah is the only living and true God.

00:44:34.579 --> 00:44:41.579
Your dedication in baptism opens the door for you to become part of the worldwide brotherhood,

00:44:41.579 --> 00:44:44.579
a true modern-day miracle.

00:44:44.579 --> 00:44:52.579
There is nothing anywhere on this planet that can compare to the visible part of Jehovah's organization

00:44:52.579 --> 00:44:57.579
made up of people from all nations, tribes, languages and backgrounds.

00:44:57.579 --> 00:45:03.579
People who really do love God and love one another.

00:45:03.579 --> 00:45:11.579
You have more opportunities now than ever before to give and receive encouragement.

00:45:11.579 --> 00:45:17.579
For example, think of the encouragement you get from the brotherhood

00:45:17.579 --> 00:45:23.579
in fulfillment of Jesus' promise at Mark 1029 and 30.

00:45:23.579 --> 00:45:30.579
In those two verses, Jesus assured His disciples that they would get a hundred times more

00:45:30.579 --> 00:45:35.579
of what they left behind in this old world and in the coming system of things.

00:45:35.579 --> 00:45:39.579
He said that they would have everlasting life.

00:45:39.579 --> 00:45:46.579
It must have given Jesus pleasure to share that wonderful and encouraging promise with His disciples

00:45:46.579 --> 00:45:51.579
and it most certainly made the disciples happy.

00:45:51.579 --> 00:45:53.579
That's how it is, isn't it?

00:45:53.579 --> 00:45:58.579
Giving and making other people happy makes us happy.

00:45:58.579 --> 00:46:03.579
The happiness you can experience by helping others is unlimited

00:46:03.579 --> 00:46:09.579
because Jehovah focuses on your motive for giving, why you give.

00:46:09.579 --> 00:46:16.579
Jehovah never takes for granted what you do and He will always reward you for it.

00:46:16.579 --> 00:46:20.579
Read with me, Hebrews chapter 6 verse 10,

00:46:20.579 --> 00:46:26.579
and take note of the fact that Jehovah God remembers why you give

00:46:26.579 --> 00:46:30.579
and what you do to advance kingdom interest.

00:46:30.579 --> 00:46:37.579
Hebrews chapter 6 and verse 10, it reads,

00:46:38.579 --> 00:46:45.579
For God is not unrighteous so as to forget your work and the love you showed for His name

00:46:45.579 --> 00:46:52.579
by ministering and continuing to minister to the holy ones.

00:46:52.579 --> 00:46:57.579
As the Scripture shows, Jehovah won't forget what you do

00:46:57.579 --> 00:47:02.579
because you are motivated by love for His name.

00:47:02.579 --> 00:47:10.579
Let's now consider more closely two areas in which baptism broadens your opportunities to give.

00:47:10.579 --> 00:47:19.579
First, making disciples, and second, helping your brothers and sisters in the faith.

00:47:19.579 --> 00:47:27.579
The foremost way for you and for me to give is by sharing the good news of the kingdom and making disciples.

00:47:27.579 --> 00:47:33.579
Jesus' exhortation to make disciples is found at Matthew 28, 19, and 20.

00:47:33.579 --> 00:47:38.579
The commission to make disciples was given not only to the first century Christians,

00:47:38.579 --> 00:47:45.579
but to all of Jesus' disciples right down to the time of the end in which we are living.

00:47:45.579 --> 00:47:50.579
Think for a moment about what is involved in disciple making.

00:47:50.579 --> 00:47:54.579
It's the result of preaching and teaching.

00:47:54.579 --> 00:48:00.579
And you know that it takes time to prepare for and take part in the ministry.

00:48:00.579 --> 00:48:06.579
The sample presentations we see in the midweek meetings are not complicated,

00:48:06.579 --> 00:48:09.579
and it's good that they don't change too often.

00:48:09.579 --> 00:48:15.579
But to have a presentation well in mind and be prepared for the field service,

00:48:15.579 --> 00:48:21.579
you may need to give up some time you formerly spent on yourself.

00:48:21.579 --> 00:48:26.579
It takes time to learn a presentation and to become familiar with it.

00:48:26.579 --> 00:48:29.579
But taking the time is worth it.

00:48:29.579 --> 00:48:36.579
It's a good feeling to be prepared and ready to preach, to have something to say,

00:48:36.579 --> 00:48:40.579
and a video to show whenever you have the opportunity.

00:48:40.579 --> 00:48:46.579
There are sheep out there, but we don't know where they are,

00:48:46.579 --> 00:48:50.579
and so we try to call on everyone.

00:48:50.579 --> 00:48:56.579
People need to hear about the kingdom, whether they accept the message or not.

00:48:56.579 --> 00:49:01.579
So don't become discouraged if you don't have the kind of result you anticipated.

00:49:01.579 --> 00:49:07.579
Just keep on preaching, and you will be blessed.

00:49:07.579 --> 00:49:13.579
When you preach, you are engaging in the most important work being done today,

00:49:13.579 --> 00:49:19.579
announcing God's kingdom, the fulfillment of Matthew 24-14.

00:49:20.579 --> 00:49:26.579
And this good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth

00:49:26.579 --> 00:49:34.380
for a witness to all the nations, and then the end will come.

00:49:34.380 --> 00:49:39.380
You are successful in obeying Jesus' words to preach the kingdom message,

00:49:39.380 --> 00:49:42.380
even when people reject the good news.

00:49:42.380 --> 00:49:45.380
You can't control how people respond,

00:49:45.380 --> 00:49:50.380
but you do not let up in preaching the life-saving message of truth.

00:49:50.380 --> 00:49:55.380
Honest hearts respond to the kingdom message.

00:49:55.380 --> 00:50:01.380
Be courageous and trust in Jehovah and his powerful spirit to help you.

00:50:01.380 --> 00:50:06.380
Your work will have everlasting results for you personally,

00:50:06.380 --> 00:50:11.380
and for those who listen to you and embrace the truth.

00:50:11.380 --> 00:50:17.380
The Apostle Paul tells us at 1 Corinthians chapter 3, verse 9,

00:50:17.380 --> 00:50:24.380
that by sharing in the ministry, you become Jehovah's Fellow Worker.

00:50:24.380 --> 00:50:26.380
Can you imagine?

00:50:26.380 --> 00:50:30.380
Jehovah invites imperfect humans to cooperate with him,

00:50:30.380 --> 00:50:37.380
the Almighty Creator, in a special work that he considers highly important.

00:50:37.380 --> 00:50:41.380
Your faith and hope become stronger as you give

00:50:41.380 --> 00:50:46.380
by sharing with others what you know about Jehovah and the kingdom.

00:50:47.380 --> 00:50:56.380
Keep in mind the simple and enriching truth stated at Proverbs chapter 11, verse 24.

00:50:56.380 --> 00:51:00.380
It applies both materially and spiritually.

00:51:00.380 --> 00:51:07.380
That's Proverbs chapter 11, verse 24, and it reads,

00:51:07.380 --> 00:51:13.380
one gives generously and ends up with more.

00:51:13.380 --> 00:51:20.380
Another withholds what should be given, but he comes to poverty.

00:51:20.380 --> 00:51:23.380
No matter how much you give to Jehovah,

00:51:23.380 --> 00:51:27.380
you will always get back more than you give.

00:51:27.380 --> 00:51:30.380
You can't outgive Jehovah.

00:51:30.380 --> 00:51:32.380
Isn't that wonderful?

00:51:32.380 --> 00:51:37.380
Seize every opportunity to give of yourself in the ministry,

00:51:37.380 --> 00:51:41.380
and your giving will continue to bring you happiness.

00:51:41.380 --> 00:51:46.380
The more involved you are, the happier you will be.

00:51:46.380 --> 00:51:50.380
Engage in the ministry every week if at all possible.

00:51:50.380 --> 00:51:58.380
Also, think seriously about reaching out to serve as an auxiliary pioneer or a regular pioneer.

00:51:58.380 --> 00:52:02.380
Talk to pioneers about the joy they get from the ministry.

00:52:02.380 --> 00:52:04.380
It's contagious.

00:52:05.380 --> 00:52:13.380
Many doors to wonderful experiences and blessings open to those who reach out to expand their ministry.

00:52:13.380 --> 00:52:23.550
Your regular participation in the preaching work allows you the opportunity to develop skill in using the Bible,

00:52:23.550 --> 00:52:29.550
starting conversations, and in using the teaching toolbox.

00:52:29.550 --> 00:52:33.550
All of us enjoy doing the things that we do well.

00:52:33.550 --> 00:52:38.550
When you're good at something, usually you like doing it.

00:52:38.550 --> 00:52:42.550
Work at improving the quality of your ministry.

00:52:42.550 --> 00:52:46.550
As you do, your joy will increase.

00:52:46.550 --> 00:52:52.550
One way joy increases is by participating in various forms of the ministry,

00:52:52.550 --> 00:52:58.550
public witnessing, house to house, informal telephone witnessing, and letter writing.

00:52:58.550 --> 00:53:07.550
Also, you can develop your skills in using the Bible, your tablet or cell phone to bring up scriptures or videos.

00:53:07.550 --> 00:53:14.550
Take the time to practice starting conversations and in using the teaching toolbox.

00:53:14.550 --> 00:53:22.550
It does take practice to find exactly what you're looking for and then using it to give a witness.

00:53:22.550 --> 00:53:30.550
Approaching strangers and engaging them in conversation about the Bible can be a challenge.

00:53:30.550 --> 00:53:31.550
Why?

00:53:31.550 --> 00:53:37.550
One reason is because some of us are more reserved than others.

00:53:37.550 --> 00:53:42.550
We are pleased to introduce Sister Lorraine E. Jackson.

00:53:42.550 --> 00:53:51.550
Sister Jackson has been serving for many years in special full-time service and visiting a variety of lands with her husband Jeffrey.

00:53:51.550 --> 00:53:54.550
Sister Jackson.

00:53:54.550 --> 00:54:03.550
At first, when you learned the truth in Fiji as a young person, how did you feel about sharing in the ministry?

00:54:03.550 --> 00:54:08.550
Brother Malenfond, I am shy and reserved by nature.

00:54:08.550 --> 00:54:18.550
And I remember that when I first learned that Jehovah wants us to preach his good news, I was excited.

00:54:18.550 --> 00:54:21.550
But even more so, I was terrified.

00:54:21.550 --> 00:54:31.550
I understood that preaching would mean approaching strangers and trying to have conversations with them often when they least expected it.

00:54:31.550 --> 00:54:37.550
And really all I wanted to do was just be quiet and be on my own.

00:54:37.550 --> 00:54:43.550
I think there are many brothers and sisters who feel the same way.

00:54:43.550 --> 00:54:47.550
What helped you to share in the ministry more fully?

00:54:47.550 --> 00:54:53.550
I think the main thing that has helped me is relying on Jehovah's help through prayer.

00:54:53.550 --> 00:54:57.550
Like many others, I talked to Jehovah constantly about my struggles.

00:54:57.550 --> 00:55:00.550
The struggle to say the right thing.

00:55:00.550 --> 00:55:06.550
The struggle to not show fear in my manner or my voice.

00:55:06.550 --> 00:55:10.550
The struggle to remember the right scriptures to use and to use them well.

00:55:10.550 --> 00:55:17.550
And of course, if someone is rude to try and remain calm and kind.

00:55:17.550 --> 00:55:20.550
Your words are appreciated.

00:55:20.550 --> 00:55:26.550
Tell us, what are some of the things that bring you joy in the ministry?

00:55:26.550 --> 00:55:32.550
The things that bring you joy are the very things I could not have done without Jehovah's help.

00:55:32.550 --> 00:55:39.550
Things like conversing freely with people, strangers, about Jehovah and the Bible.

00:55:39.550 --> 00:55:43.550
And then having the opportunity to see people's eyes light up,

00:55:43.550 --> 00:55:48.550
when they read or understand the Bible verse for the first time,

00:55:48.550 --> 00:55:50.550
I think those are really precious.

00:55:50.550 --> 00:55:54.550
And of course, helping a Bible student work through a problem

00:55:54.550 --> 00:55:57.550
and then also trying to become their friend.

00:55:57.550 --> 00:56:02.550
I think things like these really show Jehovah's power and support

00:56:02.550 --> 00:56:05.550
and all I can do is thank him for them.

00:56:06.550 --> 00:56:10.550
That's very encouraging for all of us, Mr. Jackson.

00:56:10.550 --> 00:56:18.550
My final question is, how do you feel about participating in various aspects of the ministry?

00:56:18.550 --> 00:56:24.550
I know I still lack so much, but I'm so grateful for the opportunity I've been given

00:56:24.550 --> 00:56:27.550
to participate in various aspects of the ministry,

00:56:27.550 --> 00:56:32.550
because they've allowed me to help others start their own journeys

00:56:32.550 --> 00:56:38.550
coming to Jehovah's friend, and also giving me an opportunity to work with Jehovah

00:56:38.550 --> 00:56:41.550
and really rely on him.

00:56:41.550 --> 00:56:47.550
I feel the ministry helps one, especially if one is shy,

00:56:47.550 --> 00:56:53.550
to focus on others, on Jehovah, on Jesus, on people and their needs,

00:56:53.550 --> 00:56:58.550
and not so much on one's own limitations.

00:56:58.550 --> 00:57:02.550
It's true, I'm still very reserved and shy,

00:57:02.550 --> 00:57:06.550
and as those close to me know, some days are good,

00:57:06.550 --> 00:57:11.550
and other days I feel like hiding somewhere and not saying much.

00:57:11.550 --> 00:57:15.550
However, the ministry has helped me manage my shyness

00:57:15.550 --> 00:57:20.550
and has helped train me to accept other assignments of service.

00:57:20.550 --> 00:57:25.550
I am convinced that anyone, whether a timid or otherwise,

00:57:25.550 --> 00:57:33.550
can rejoice in the ministry, provided they rely constantly on Jehovah and focus on him.

00:57:33.550 --> 00:57:39.550
Thank you very much, Sister Jackson, for such encouraging expressions of faith.

00:57:39.550 --> 00:57:44.219
Jehovah is there to help us.

00:57:44.219 --> 00:57:53.219
If we trust in him and put forth a sincere effort to give of ourselves in the preaching activity,

00:57:53.219 --> 00:57:59.219
the second way to give is by helping those related to us in the faith.

00:57:59.219 --> 00:58:03.219
Paul wrote about this at Galatians 6-10.

00:58:03.219 --> 00:58:05.219
It reads,

00:58:05.219 --> 00:58:09.219
So then, as long as we have the opportunity,

00:58:09.219 --> 00:58:17.219
let us work what is good toward all, but especially toward those related to us in the faith.

00:58:17.219 --> 00:58:21.219
Yes, you are part of a beautiful family,

00:58:21.219 --> 00:58:26.219
willingly use your time, energy, and resources to assist your fellow believers,

00:58:26.219 --> 00:58:29.219
and work what is good toward them.

00:58:29.219 --> 00:58:32.219
Think about your brothers in the congregation,

00:58:32.219 --> 00:58:36.219
and identify those whom you can assist in practical ways.

00:58:36.219 --> 00:58:38.219
Ask yourself,

00:58:38.219 --> 00:58:44.219
is there someone in the congregation I could help by giving that person a ride to a meeting,

00:58:44.219 --> 00:58:48.219
or perhaps run an errand for him or for her?

00:58:48.219 --> 00:58:53.219
Perhaps visit the elderly and offer to assist them in practical ways.

00:58:53.219 --> 00:58:57.219
We all want to show personal interest in our brothers and sisters,

00:58:57.219 --> 00:59:01.219
and be a source of encouragement to them.

00:59:02.219 --> 00:59:07.219
Also, we want to support relief efforts for needy Christians.

00:59:07.219 --> 00:59:09.219
Natural disasters occur,

00:59:09.219 --> 00:59:14.219
and there is sickness as well as poverty among many other things.

00:59:14.219 --> 00:59:22.219
Doesn't it thrill you when you read how the brothers respond generously to assist fellow believers who are in need?

00:59:23.219 --> 00:59:26.219
At 2 Corinthians 8, 1 through 4,

00:59:26.219 --> 00:59:31.219
Paul expresses deep appreciation for the brothers in Macedonia,

00:59:31.219 --> 00:59:35.219
and notice why Paul felt that way.

00:59:35.219 --> 00:59:39.219
2 Corinthians 8 verses 1 through 4.

00:59:39.219 --> 00:59:42.619
Now we want you to know, brothers,

00:59:42.619 --> 00:59:45.619
about the undeserved kindness of God

00:59:45.619 --> 00:59:49.619
that has been granted to the congregations of Macedonia.

00:59:50.619 --> 00:59:53.619
During a great test under affliction,

00:59:53.619 --> 01:00:00.619
their abundance of joy and their deep poverty made the riches of their generosity abound.

01:00:00.619 --> 01:00:02.619
For it was according to their means,

01:00:02.619 --> 01:00:04.619
yes, I testify,

01:00:04.619 --> 01:00:06.619
it was even beyond their means,

01:00:06.619 --> 01:00:09.619
while they, on their own initiative,

01:00:09.619 --> 01:00:13.619
kept earnestly begging us for the privilege of kindly giving

01:00:13.619 --> 01:00:18.619
to have a share in the relief ministry for the holy ones.

01:00:19.619 --> 01:00:26.619
The brothers in Macedonia took the initiative to provide loving help to their spiritual family

01:00:26.619 --> 01:00:29.619
in spite of their own poverty.

01:00:29.619 --> 01:00:36.619
What a fine example for us to be generous and ready to assist our spiritual brothers and sisters

01:00:36.619 --> 01:00:38.619
whatever way we can.

01:00:38.619 --> 01:00:46.469
Giving to others can be done in different ways.

01:00:46.469 --> 01:00:48.469
With that thought in mind,

01:00:48.469 --> 01:00:52.469
we are happy to interview Sister Penny Pierce.

01:00:52.469 --> 01:00:54.469
Sister Pierce,

01:00:54.469 --> 01:00:56.469
you have raised a family,

01:00:56.469 --> 01:00:59.469
you've spent decades in special full-time service,

01:00:59.469 --> 01:01:03.469
and traveled to a variety of lands with your husband Guy

01:01:03.469 --> 01:01:05.469
who was a member of the governing body.

01:01:05.469 --> 01:01:07.469
And like Dorcas,

01:01:07.469 --> 01:01:10.469
you have a reputation for abounding

01:01:10.469 --> 01:01:13.469
in good deeds and gifts of mercy.

01:01:13.469 --> 01:01:15.469
Tell us Sister Pierce,

01:01:15.469 --> 01:01:18.469
what motivates you to assist others?

01:01:18.469 --> 01:01:22.469
With the answer is found in 1 Corinthians 29, 14,

01:01:22.469 --> 01:01:23.469
where it says,

01:01:23.469 --> 01:01:24.469
for everything is from you,

01:01:24.469 --> 01:01:26.469
and we have given to you

01:01:26.469 --> 01:01:28.469
what comes from your own hand.

01:01:28.469 --> 01:01:30.469
So anything that I may give

01:01:30.469 --> 01:01:32.469
actually comes from Jehovah.

01:01:32.469 --> 01:01:34.469
Recently, with the coronavirus,

01:01:34.469 --> 01:01:39.469
we've seen an outpouring of Jehovah's people giving.

01:01:39.469 --> 01:01:42.469
We all have given time and energy,

01:01:42.469 --> 01:01:44.469
emotions, a listening ear,

01:01:44.469 --> 01:01:45.469
and video chatting.

01:01:45.469 --> 01:01:47.469
Everyone, young and old,

01:01:47.469 --> 01:01:49.469
gave love, faith, and trust,

01:01:49.469 --> 01:01:51.469
and it didn't cost anything.

01:01:51.469 --> 01:01:53.469
I felt Jehovah is doing wonderful things

01:01:53.469 --> 01:01:56.469
in the middle of a tragic pandemic.

01:01:56.469 --> 01:02:01.469
What you said is truly practical and very helpful.

01:02:01.469 --> 01:02:05.469
Sister Pierce, please tell us the experience you had

01:02:05.469 --> 01:02:07.469
when you hosted brothers and sisters

01:02:07.469 --> 01:02:10.469
during a special preaching campaign.

01:02:10.469 --> 01:02:15.469
What times we have the opportunity to help materially too.

01:02:15.469 --> 01:02:17.469
Some years ago when the family was home,

01:02:17.469 --> 01:02:20.469
we had 30 people coming to stay at our home.

01:02:20.469 --> 01:02:22.469
They were going to preach to refugees.

01:02:22.469 --> 01:02:23.469
I had one bathroom,

01:02:23.469 --> 01:02:26.469
and I had $25,

01:02:26.469 --> 01:02:28.469
which I spent completely on food.

01:02:28.469 --> 01:02:30.469
Now I had zero.

01:02:30.469 --> 01:02:32.469
We never told anyone we didn't have money.

01:02:32.469 --> 01:02:34.469
I knew they didn't have money too.

01:02:34.469 --> 01:02:36.469
We had a wonderful time.

01:02:36.469 --> 01:02:38.469
When the friends left Sunday night,

01:02:38.469 --> 01:02:40.469
I had more food than when they came.

01:02:40.469 --> 01:02:44.469
That food lasted us for 10 days to the end of the month.

01:02:44.469 --> 01:02:47.469
But I worried about the effect on my teenage sons.

01:02:47.469 --> 01:02:50.469
So I asked one how he felt.

01:02:50.469 --> 01:02:51.469
He said,

01:02:51.469 --> 01:02:55.469
I know you have a jar of flour and oil.

01:02:55.469 --> 01:02:58.469
I didn't worry anymore.

01:02:58.469 --> 01:03:00.469
Jehovah certainly blessed you.

01:03:00.469 --> 01:03:03.469
Tell us how you view what you did

01:03:03.469 --> 01:03:06.469
to host the friends that came to preach in your area.

01:03:06.469 --> 01:03:11.469
Many of these acts of kindness I did were very small to me,

01:03:11.469 --> 01:03:15.469
but often I didn't know the big impact it would have in their lives.

01:03:15.469 --> 01:03:20.469
That's when you realize you've had the privilege of working with Holy Spirit.

01:03:20.469 --> 01:03:24.469
It's nothing I did. It's what Jehovah did.

01:03:24.469 --> 01:03:27.469
That's beautiful, Sister Pierce.

01:03:27.469 --> 01:03:31.469
Now we would like to hear a final expression from you

01:03:31.469 --> 01:03:36.469
of the joy that you receive personally in giving.

01:03:36.469 --> 01:03:40.469
When never gives to Jehovah and not received back a hundredfold,

01:03:40.469 --> 01:03:44.469
it may not come from the same source, but it will come.

01:03:44.469 --> 01:03:47.469
Jehovah promises in Acts 2035,

01:03:47.469 --> 01:03:51.469
there is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving.

01:03:51.469 --> 01:03:55.469
I have to admit, Jehovah spoils me with blessings.

01:03:55.469 --> 01:03:59.469
Thank you very much, Sister Pierce.

01:03:59.469 --> 01:04:03.469
Jehovah has certainly blessed you for your generosity

01:04:03.469 --> 01:04:09.780
and your warm Christian hospitality.

01:04:09.780 --> 01:04:13.780
Helping one another strengthens the bonds of the Brotherhood.

01:04:13.780 --> 01:04:19.780
And there is nothing like knowing that your brothers really do love you.

01:04:19.780 --> 01:04:23.780
That's how the brothers in Jerusalem felt when they were in need

01:04:23.780 --> 01:04:27.780
and received loving assistance from the brothers in Corinth.

01:04:28.780 --> 01:04:34.780
Please turn to 2 Corinthians chapter 9 verses 11 through 14.

01:04:34.780 --> 01:04:37.780
This is where the Apostle Paul describes the reaction

01:04:37.780 --> 01:04:43.780
of the needy brothers in Jerusalem to the generosity of the brothers in Corinth,

01:04:43.780 --> 01:04:49.780
that 2 Corinthians chapter 9 verses 11 through 14.

01:04:49.780 --> 01:04:52.780
And this is what Paul wrote.

01:04:52.780 --> 01:04:58.780
In everything, you are being enriched for every sort of generosity

01:04:58.780 --> 01:05:03.780
which produces through us an expression of thanks to God.

01:05:03.780 --> 01:05:07.780
Because the ministry of this public service is not only to provide well

01:05:07.780 --> 01:05:11.780
for the needs of the Holy Ones, but also to be rich

01:05:11.780 --> 01:05:15.780
in many expressions of thanks to God.

01:05:15.780 --> 01:05:20.780
Through the proof that this relief ministry gives,

01:05:20.780 --> 01:05:24.780
they, that is the holy ones in Jerusalem, glorify God

01:05:24.780 --> 01:05:28.780
because you are submissive to the good news about the Christ

01:05:28.780 --> 01:05:32.780
as you publicly declared and because you are generous

01:05:32.780 --> 01:05:36.780
in your contribution to them and to all.

01:05:36.780 --> 01:05:41.780
And with supplication for you, they express affection for you

01:05:41.780 --> 01:05:46.780
because of the surpassing undeserved kindness of God upon you.

01:05:47.780 --> 01:05:51.780
The brothers in Jerusalem glorified Jehovah,

01:05:51.780 --> 01:05:54.780
not just because they received some material provisions,

01:05:54.780 --> 01:05:58.780
but rather it was because the brothers in Corinth,

01:05:58.780 --> 01:06:01.780
who for the most part were new in the Christian faith,

01:06:01.780 --> 01:06:05.780
were motivated by love to send material help.

01:06:05.780 --> 01:06:10.780
Yes, the truth was in their hearts and made them cheerful

01:06:10.780 --> 01:06:13.780
givers to the brothers in Jerusalem.

01:06:13.780 --> 01:06:19.780
So they all were happy and felt Jehovah's love and approval.

01:06:19.780 --> 01:06:25.780
Eubaptism candidates will rejoice as you sense and are convinced

01:06:25.780 --> 01:06:29.780
that Jehovah is pleased with what you do.

01:06:29.780 --> 01:06:35.780
Proverbs 1917 tells us how Jehovah views unselfish giving

01:06:35.780 --> 01:06:37.780
to those in need.

01:06:37.780 --> 01:06:39.780
It says,

01:06:39.780 --> 01:06:44.780
the one showing favor to the lowly is lending to Jehovah

01:06:44.780 --> 01:06:48.780
and he will repay him for what he does.

01:06:48.780 --> 01:06:52.780
Can you imagine lending to Jehovah?

01:06:52.780 --> 01:06:57.780
When we give spiritual or material help to our brothers in need,

01:06:57.780 --> 01:07:02.780
Jehovah sees and views it as a loan to him.

01:07:02.780 --> 01:07:07.780
Remember, you can't outgive Jehovah by giving to others

01:07:07.780 --> 01:07:09.780
and refreshing them.

01:07:09.780 --> 01:07:15.780
The giver in turn will benefit himself as Proverbs 11.25 says,

01:07:15.780 --> 01:07:20.780
the generous person will prosper and whoever refreshes others

01:07:20.780 --> 01:07:23.780
will himself be refreshed.

01:07:23.780 --> 01:07:32.059
Today you feel happy because you are giving of yourself to Jehovah,

01:07:32.059 --> 01:07:34.059
to serve him forever.

01:07:34.059 --> 01:07:38.059
You make us happy by taking that decision.

01:07:38.059 --> 01:07:42.059
We exhort you to maintain your happiness

01:07:42.059 --> 01:07:46.059
by doing what you can reasonably do to help others

01:07:46.059 --> 01:07:51.059
by giving both in the ministry and in the congregation.

01:07:51.059 --> 01:07:57.059
Jehovah will give back to you in more ways than you can imagine.

01:07:57.059 --> 01:08:03.059
May the way in which you live as dedicated servants of Jehovah

01:08:03.059 --> 01:08:09.059
reflect, forever, the fundamental truth revealed by Jesus.

01:08:09.059 --> 01:08:16.500
There is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving.

01:08:16.500 --> 01:08:19.500
Thank you, Brother Melanfant.

01:08:19.500 --> 01:08:24.500
This year, the circumstances for baptism will vary in each location.

01:08:24.500 --> 01:08:28.500
Many of you are watching this broadcast from a private home.

01:08:28.500 --> 01:08:32.500
Possibly, others of you are able to gather at a kingdom hall.

01:08:32.500 --> 01:08:36.500
In any event, your elders have made suitable provisions

01:08:36.500 --> 01:08:40.500
in a court with local circumstances for candidates to be baptized

01:08:40.500 --> 01:08:43.500
after the conclusion of this session.

01:08:43.500 --> 01:08:47.500
As soon as we finish singing song number 79 together,

01:08:47.500 --> 01:08:50.500
baptism candidates in your congregations will have an opportunity

01:08:50.500 --> 01:08:53.500
to make a public declaration of their faith.

01:08:53.500 --> 01:08:57.500
By answering the two questions posed by a local elder,

01:08:57.500 --> 01:09:00.500
after which he will offer the prayer.

01:09:00.500 --> 01:09:03.500
Please be assured that the brothers at the branch office

01:09:03.500 --> 01:09:06.500
look forward to receiving your reports about these baptisms

01:09:06.500 --> 01:09:09.500
from the circuit overseers.

01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:14.500
And now, let us all stand and sing together song number 79,

01:09:14.500 --> 01:09:17.500
teach them to stand firm.
