WEBVTT

00:00:01.229 --> 00:00:20.289
You wanted to see me?

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:25.079
Yeah, come on in and go ahead and close the door, please.

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:26.079
Thanks for coming up.

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:27.079
Yeah, absolutely.

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:31.079
And Ben, all of your projects have come in on schedule and under budget.

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:32.079
We're really impressed.

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:35.079
And we want to move you up to the management team.

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:38.079
Now, you had up the whole division to start.

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:43.079
Management team, I like the sound of that.

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.079
Not to mention the pay raise and the bonuses.

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.079
It did sound like a lot more work.

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.079
Victor was so positive.

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:55.079
There may be a little overtime here and there, but I wouldn't worry about it.

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.079
Not with your skill.

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:00.079
He told me I could think about it before deciding.

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:02.079
But come on.

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:06.480
This was a no-brainer.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.480
The new position was great.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.480
And the money?

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:15.480
Well, that wasn't too bad either.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.480
It was exciting to work directly with clients.

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:25.420
But the hours were crazy.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:32.829
Our seldom the same.

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:36.829
We see an example of this in this week's Bible reading.

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:40.829
True worship, the right thing, was not easy.

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.829
But required hard work.

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:48.670
Kim has a client.

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.670
So a question for the audience is, how could we explain this to someone?

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:59.019
Able, please.

00:01:59.019 --> 00:02:11.449
Most nights, I was wiped out.

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:24.610
And I have to admit, even when I wasn't working, I was working.

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:33.969
We're really impressed.

00:02:33.969 --> 00:02:35.969
And we want to move you up to the management team.

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:38.969
Now, you head up the whole division to start.

00:02:38.969 --> 00:02:41.969
Victor's offer really took me by surprise.

00:02:41.969 --> 00:02:52.509
And wow, the perks were tempting.

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:55.509
But I knew there was a lot at stake.

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:59.509
So I told him I talked to Lisa and get back to him tomorrow.

00:02:59.509 --> 00:03:09.819
What was this job going to mean for our spiritual goals?

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:21.139
Would we still be able to keep our life simple?

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:26.139
Were we ready to trade our time together as a family for more money?

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:49.699
The next day, I told Victor how much I appreciated the opportunity,

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:54.699
but felt that it just wasn't the right fit for our family.

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:58.699
Money was tight, but we were okay.

00:03:58.699 --> 00:04:06.099
We had what we needed, saying no to that promotion,

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:16.870
meant holding off on a few upgrades.

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:26.860
But it also meant more time for meeting preparation,

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:36.819
more time for the ministry, and more time for each other.

00:04:36.819 --> 00:04:55.790
Hey Ben, looks like you forgot to sign off from the job order.

00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:00.790
Actually, these failed that quality inspection, remember?

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:02.790
Yeah, but I like two chances of a point.

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:05.790
Yeah, I already talked to Steve about replacing the components,

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:07.790
and we're going to get that order adjusted

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:10.790
and I'll have a new one for you on your desk tomorrow afternoon.

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:19.040
Ben, there's no time for that.

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.040
This is a huge account.

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:25.040
If you don't sign off on this, you'd be hurting the whole company.

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:28.420
What?

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:33.420
Victor, I'm not sure that I'm really comfortable

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:37.420
bypassing the inspection when...

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:41.420
Ben, I'm not asking you to tell some big lie.

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:44.420
This is a technicality.

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:50.420
Remember, a good quarter means good bonuses for everyone, including you.

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:57.740
I didn't want to do it.

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:02.740
But the last thing that Lisa and I needed was for me to lose my job.

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:12.550
I really didn't have a choice.

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:19.350
They can't believe you.

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:23.350
I kept telling myself that it was no big deal.

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:25.350
All lies are bad.

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:27.350
Even little ones.

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:29.350
One lie leads to another.

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:38.139
And they cause much harm.

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:43.310
It's simple, right?

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:56.360
Jehovah's people always tell the truth.

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:57.360
Hey Ben, how you doing?

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:58.360
Good, how's the job going?

00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:59.360
Oh, machines running great.

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:01.360
Ben, I did have a question on the specs for the Harris to job.

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:02.360
Can we take a quick look?

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:05.949
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:07:05.949 --> 00:07:06.949
You need a hand?

00:07:06.949 --> 00:07:07.949
No, I'm good.

00:07:07.949 --> 00:07:21.339
What happened, guys?

00:07:21.339 --> 00:07:23.339
We got to do something up.

00:07:23.339 --> 00:07:32.769
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:07:32.769 --> 00:07:39.769
I'm pretty sure that I would just say it stopped working.

00:07:39.769 --> 00:07:53.899
Whatever you do, don't tell Victor what happened.

00:07:53.899 --> 00:07:56.899
We just got this set up last month.

00:07:56.899 --> 00:07:58.899
Why would it just stop working?

00:07:58.899 --> 00:08:00.899
It could happen.

00:08:02.899 --> 00:08:08.180
You can actually smell the coffee.

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:09.180
I'll talk to Victor.

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:11.180
Don't throw yourself under the bus, man.

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:13.180
We'll help you get this cleaned up.

00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:14.180
No one will have to know.

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:18.180
This is one of the most expensive units in the shop.

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:21.180
You take the blame and you just make yourself look bad.

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:26.139
No, it's okay.

00:08:26.139 --> 00:08:28.139
It was a mistake.

00:08:28.139 --> 00:08:30.139
I'll explain it.

00:08:30.139 --> 00:08:57.480
We need to get this back online.

00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:05.100
In the end, I think Victor actually appreciated my honesty.

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:08.100
But he wasn't the only one.

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:11.100
Mark had some questions.

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:25.179
And we had a great discussion.

00:09:25.179 --> 00:09:27.179
The company took on new clients this year.

00:09:27.179 --> 00:09:33.179
And I knew that Victor was really depending on me to keep things on schedule.

00:09:33.179 --> 00:09:36.179
I didn't want to let him down.

00:09:36.179 --> 00:09:44.179
So, I stepped up and took on the overtime hours.

00:09:44.179 --> 00:09:48.179
I figured it was temporary.

00:09:48.179 --> 00:09:53.509
And I even got to take home a bigger paycheck.

00:09:53.509 --> 00:09:56.509
The problem is,

00:09:56.509 --> 00:10:02.990
that's not all I took home.

00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:13.519
By the end of each week, I was burned out.

00:10:13.519 --> 00:10:20.350
And the weekends?

00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:26.590
Well, they weren't really any better.

00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:40.620
In fact, I spent a lot of Saturdays back at the office.

00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:43.620
The project took a lot longer than I thought.

00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:46.620
That pretty much took out field service and the meetings.

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:49.620
But I knew that management would be impressed.

00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:52.620
That machine is essential so I can get these parts.

00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:55.620
I got the reports in right on time.

00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:57.620
Look, this is costing a lot of money.

00:10:57.620 --> 00:10:59.620
I got a first quarter that I have to meet.

00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:01.620
And without this, it's going to kill me.

00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:06.950
You know, we had a contract that you were supposed to...

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:13.139
Like I said, I don't care about you.

00:11:13.139 --> 00:11:15.139
I was working harder than ever.

00:11:15.139 --> 00:11:17.139
And in the end,

00:11:17.139 --> 00:11:20.139
I'm not sure anyone even cared.

00:11:39.279 --> 00:11:42.279
It had been a busy week.

00:11:42.279 --> 00:11:46.279
But the weekend was going to be even busier.

00:11:46.279 --> 00:11:47.279
And better.

00:11:47.279 --> 00:11:57.129
But first, I needed to make an important stop.

00:11:57.129 --> 00:12:10.299
Hey, John, how are you feeling?

00:12:10.299 --> 00:12:13.299
Ben, how are you doing?

00:12:13.299 --> 00:12:14.299
Good.

00:12:14.299 --> 00:12:18.299
This illness had been so hard on John and Sandy.

00:12:18.299 --> 00:12:35.320
I couldn't even imagine what they were going through.

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:38.320
It was so encouraging to see John's positive attitude.

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:46.039
The next day, we had a fantastic conversation in the ministry.

00:12:46.039 --> 00:12:56.700
Then, Tom and I finally figured out that glitch in the AV system.

00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:57.700
Okay, Tom.

00:12:57.700 --> 00:12:58.700
Go ahead and hit play.

00:12:58.700 --> 00:12:59.700
It's played.

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:00.700
Okay.

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:09.539
Everything looked and sounded great.

00:13:09.539 --> 00:13:18.960
We definitely were busy.

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:22.960
But in the best way possible.

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:25.960
Doing things that really mattered.

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:27.960
And for people who love Jehovah.

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:44.419
And believe me, that's not the only dirt I have on Victor.

00:13:44.419 --> 00:13:45.419
Okay.

00:13:45.419 --> 00:13:46.419
We're listening.

00:13:46.419 --> 00:13:49.419
So last week, he's talking in his office, right?

00:13:49.419 --> 00:13:52.419
And he has no idea that I'm standing right there.

00:13:52.419 --> 00:13:54.419
And he's bragging to his buddy.

00:13:54.419 --> 00:13:57.419
I really didn't want to hear this.

00:13:57.419 --> 00:13:59.419
Lunch with them seemed harmless.

00:13:59.419 --> 00:14:03.419
But this was anything but a building.

00:14:03.419 --> 00:14:06.419
Hey, hey, check out these guys.

00:14:06.419 --> 00:14:08.419
It's the Bible people.

00:14:08.419 --> 00:14:13.320
Uh-oh.

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:14.320
They don't look now.

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:16.320
They have someone.

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:19.320
They might try to convert us, too.

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:27.639
What is the deal with these people?

00:14:27.639 --> 00:14:30.639
I mean, it's cool if you want to believe in fairy tales and everything.

00:14:30.639 --> 00:14:32.639
But keep it to yourself, right?

00:14:32.639 --> 00:14:33.639
Exactly.

00:14:33.639 --> 00:14:35.639
Exactly.

00:14:35.639 --> 00:14:39.639
Those carts are everywhere now.

00:14:39.639 --> 00:14:45.320
They're all over the city.

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:49.529
I couldn't finish my lunch.

00:14:49.529 --> 00:14:58.240
I had never noticed how sarcastic and negative my co-workers could be.

00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:07.879
I had always thought of them as, well, as friends.

00:15:07.879 --> 00:15:15.299
But what kind of friends was I making?

00:15:15.299 --> 00:15:36.870
I was so glad I had taken a day off from work.

00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:52.379
How long had it been since Lisa and I got to spend a whole day together in midweek service?

00:15:52.379 --> 00:15:54.379
Lisa started a Bible study.

00:15:54.379 --> 00:16:01.250
And we got to share our day with good friends.

00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:03.250
People like Sam and Chloe.

00:16:03.250 --> 00:16:06.250
They've really been there for us through the ups and downs.

00:16:06.250 --> 00:16:22.039
Is that you?

00:16:22.039 --> 00:16:26.039
What are you doing over there?

00:16:26.039 --> 00:16:29.039
Did you guys know about this?

00:16:29.039 --> 00:16:44.480
I don't know where we'd be if Jehovah hadn't helped us to keep our priorities straight.

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:48.720
Keeping our life simple.

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:54.409
Having a clean conscience.

00:16:54.409 --> 00:16:59.409
Staying focused on work that has real meaning.

00:16:59.409 --> 00:17:07.430
And having real friends.

00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:09.430
What more can you ask for?
