00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:09.919
2012 was the best year of my life.

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:14.660
That's when the Becundo always Frenchers began.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.379
This year's helped us all learn about the Hover.

00:00:17.379 --> 00:00:28.530
You wonder, how does it get made?

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.010
Let's take a little field trip and find out.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.890
It all starts with the governing body.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.929
They carefully choose what lessons they want to teach us.

00:00:37.929 --> 00:00:41.490
Then they give those ideas to the animation team at Bethel.

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:43.689
I talk about it.

00:00:43.689 --> 00:00:48.630
Then the megastories.

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:50.149
Now it's ready to record.

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:52.030
Hello!

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:53.429
Time for dinner.

00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:58.469
After that, the artists make the store into pictures.

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:06.579
They draw houses and chairs, airplanes and bikes, and 3D people.

00:01:06.579 --> 00:01:09.980
The team puts the pictures together to make a movie.

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.500
Wow, nice drawing.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.500
What happens next?

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.980
Have you ever made stuff with clay?

00:01:17.019 --> 00:01:22.530
Well, that's what the modelers do, except on the computer.

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.730
Something's missing.

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:29.019
Oh yeah, color.

00:01:29.019 --> 00:01:30.939
That's better.

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:36.219
So they write a story, record voices, and design the characters.

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:38.500
Do you know what comes next?

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.579
Hey, what's going on?

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:42.299
Caleb, need help?

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.700
Uh, I can't move.

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.500
That's because you need a rig.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.739
A rig?

00:01:47.739 --> 00:01:51.420
3D characters need bones and muscles, just like people.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.620
These bones, along with hundreds of controls, are called a rig.

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:04.200
Whoa, whoa, please stop doing that.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.200
Wanna test out that rig?

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.200
Whoa!

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:10.000
How better?

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.900
Now I know it's animation time.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.379
Animators make 3D people come to life.

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:20.500
First, they study people.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.500
Then they can make 3D people do the same thing.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.580
What happened?

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.379
Looks like we're missing something.

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:30.979
What?

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:32.379
We need lights.

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:34.379
That way everyone can see us.

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:44.300
Can someone please turn on the lights?

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.099
See all these pieces flying around?

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:49.099
Somebody has to put them together.

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:56.460
That's pretty cool.

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.740
They need to make the sound effects.

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:05.039
Sometimes they get to play with toys.

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:07.439
Then they write music.

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:10.439
Including new songs, like Pray Any Time.

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:14.340
All these kids.

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.539
Kids around the world record songs in over 100 languages.

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:19.539
Oh, Sherry.

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:22.139
I'm going to prepare a bunch of things, okay?

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:23.139
Yeah, whoa.

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:24.340
Come on, love's better than it.

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:25.539
Yeah, that's right.

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:28.539
Hey, why do we sound funny?

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:31.740
What we're saying is to be changed into other languages.

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:35.939
Because all over the world can understand us.

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:41.340
Even translate us into sign language.

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:47.139
Jehovah loves children.

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:54.819
This series teaches them more than just right and wrong.

00:03:54.819 --> 00:04:02.419
It teaches them that Jehovah is real.

00:04:02.419 --> 00:04:22.160
And it helps them to become his friend.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.100
It's okay.

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.899
We do it with friend too, just like them.

00:04:28.899 --> 00:04:29.899
Do you?
