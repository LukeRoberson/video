00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.849
The graduation of the 150th class of Gilead,

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.410
who would have thought that we would have 150 classes

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:13.609
of Gilead, and probably for you students,

00:00:13.609 --> 00:00:15.570
you were wondering if you would survive

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.489
to the 150th graduation.

00:00:19.489 --> 00:00:23.089
Over the years, graduations of Gilead

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:25.589
have taken various forms.

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:27.609
If you look at this photograph,

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:31.329
you'll notice that the seventh class,

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:34.450
the graduation was in 1946.

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:35.609
And what do you notice?

00:00:35.609 --> 00:00:38.090
The guests who came along,

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.170
they were in the open air, hoping for good weather.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.210
And I'm told there was no,

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:45.729
it wasn't a ticket at the event,

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:49.210
so just those that wanted to come along came along.

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:50.770
And then notice in the next one here,

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:54.770
we've got the president giving one of the talks

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.770
on the stairs leading up to Gilead.

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:59.850
Well, things have changed.

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.369
In 1953, the 21st class,

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:07.450
graduated at the Yankee Stadium,

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.170
and you'd imagine that was a huge event.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.930
And in fact, it commemorated

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.090
the 10th anniversary of Gilead,

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:15.930
and was very appropriate because

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.530
that was a very special year, 1953.

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.010
That was the year that the U.S. government

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:23.730
granted us legal status

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:26.409
so that we could have foreign students come

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:28.290
and join the school.

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.769
And then, of course, no matter what graduation we've had,

00:01:31.769 --> 00:01:35.489
always the joyous look on the faces of those graduating.

00:01:35.489 --> 00:01:37.290
That's the common denominator.

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:39.569
Of course, in recent years,

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:42.290
we've had some very different graduations as well.

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.969
Haven't we, with no live audience?

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:49.090
But aren't you happy that we've got a live audience today?

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.439
Now, after the last few months,

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:01.120
you've been so through so many lessons

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.000
and written exams and so on,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.200
there's been a lot of training.

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.199
And what has been the purpose of all of that?

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:13.840
Well, when we think of worldly institutions and education,

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.319
usually it's all about the students, isn't it?

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:21.520
It's all about their dreams, as Brother Morris mentioned.

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.639
It's all about their ambitions

00:02:23.639 --> 00:02:27.400
and their success that they're looking forward to.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.560
But what about Gilead?

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.159
Well, you've learned very clearly, I'm sure,

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:33.639
that it's not about you.

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:36.639
And if you haven't, maybe we need to enroll you

00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:38.280
in the next class as well.

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:43.159
No, as dedicated servants of Jehovah,

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:45.800
we see that it's nothing is about us.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.680
It's not all about us.

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.280
It's about what we can accomplish

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.680
in praising our Heavenly Father, Jehovah.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.639
So now you're at this point

00:02:55.719 --> 00:02:58.639
where you're about to graduate.

00:02:58.639 --> 00:02:59.479
Now what?

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.199
Now's the time for you to share what you've learned with others.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.280
Now what does that involve?

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.159
Does this mean you're going to go to different assignments

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:13.879
and start up little Gilead classes, informally,

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:16.280
in the back rooms of Kingdom Halls?

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.719
I wouldn't advise that.

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:23.719
So what does it mean to share what you've learned with others?

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:30.080
Well, as it has already been highlighted in this program,

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.719
your example working hard is going to help others

00:03:34.719 --> 00:03:38.360
to see in action what you learned at Gilead.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.240
But also, we see a very interesting scripture

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:43.879
in the second book of Timothy.

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:48.000
So please turn with me to second Timothy chapter two

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:49.639
and verse two.

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:52.680
And here Paul is speaking to Timothy,

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.800
but he captures the thought of what else we need to do.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:57.919
In verse two, it says,

00:03:57.919 --> 00:03:59.919
the things you heard from me

00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:02.439
that were supported by many witnesses,

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:05.759
these things in trust of faithful men

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:10.759
who in turn will be adequately qualified to teach others.

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.759
What do we see from this particular verse?

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.439
Well, yes, you will teach by your example, doing hard work,

00:04:19.439 --> 00:04:23.240
but also you need to take interest in others

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.160
and perhaps in a more informal setting,

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.920
help them to see the principles and the lessons

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.319
that you've learned from your Gilead training.

00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:34.439
And that's a very important thing.

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.959
We can take the example of our Lord Jesus Christ.

00:04:38.959 --> 00:04:41.720
Of course, Jesus was, His main focus

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.040
was the preaching of the good news of the Kingdom, wasn't it?

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.000
But that's not all He did.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.439
If we turn to Mark chapter nine,

00:04:50.439 --> 00:04:55.439
notice in Jesus busy schedule what He made time for.

00:04:56.199 --> 00:05:00.240
This is Mark chapter nine, verses 30 and 31.

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.160
They departed from there and went through Galilee,

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.920
but He did not want anyone to get to know about it.

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:12.600
So this was something where He wanted some peace and quiet.

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:13.959
Why?

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Well, verse 31 says,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.399
for He was teaching His disciples.

00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:23.680
So Jesus took time from His busy schedule

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:27.319
to show interest in those who He was training

00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:30.360
to help them to be prepared for the future.

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.519
So that's a wonderful example for us.

00:05:33.519 --> 00:05:34.879
When we look through the scriptures,

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:37.920
we see many examples, but for the next few minutes,

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.439
we're going to think about Barnabas.

00:05:41.399 --> 00:05:46.399
And how Barnabas was able to share what He learned with Paul.

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.720
And as we think about what happened in that interaction

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:53.160
between Barnabas and Paul,

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.120
we're going to learn five lessons,

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:59.560
five lessons that teach us how to handle

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:02.399
training others and passing on what we've learned.

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:05.360
So the first lesson, if you turn with me,

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:09.240
please, to the book of Acts, Acts chapter nine.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:14.279
This takes us to the year around the year 36C.

00:06:14.279 --> 00:06:18.240
So Saul has already become a Christian.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:21.079
Now, after a while, he arrives in Jerusalem.

00:06:21.079 --> 00:06:22.879
So what happens?

00:06:22.879 --> 00:06:25.439
In verse 26 of chapter nine, it says,

00:06:25.439 --> 00:06:28.879
on arriving in Jerusalem, He, that's Paul,

00:06:28.879 --> 00:06:31.959
made efforts to join the disciples,

00:06:31.959 --> 00:06:33.720
but they were all afraid of Him.

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:34.720
I wonder why?

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:38.879
Because they did not believe He was a disciple.

00:06:39.319 --> 00:06:43.120
They were thinking this is going to be a very dangerous thing.

00:06:43.959 --> 00:06:47.040
But now what happened in verse 27?

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:52.040
So Barnabas came to his aid and led him to the apostles.

00:06:53.279 --> 00:06:56.399
So we see as pictured here,

00:06:56.399 --> 00:07:01.399
Barnabas saw the potential in Saul

00:07:01.439 --> 00:07:03.279
and believed that really,

00:07:03.279 --> 00:07:05.800
he could be useful in Jehovah's service.

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.959
So he risked his reputation, you might say,

00:07:08.959 --> 00:07:12.040
by supporting or sponsoring Saul

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:14.759
and taking him to the apostles.

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:19.120
So what's the lesson that we learn from this?

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:23.879
Try to see the potential in others.

00:07:23.879 --> 00:07:27.439
And don't worry about if you perhaps encourage them

00:07:27.439 --> 00:07:30.839
and you give them support, you sponsor them, you might say,

00:07:30.839 --> 00:07:32.920
and then they don't really turn out well,

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:34.959
but now all of a sudden your reputation

00:07:34.959 --> 00:07:36.720
is going to be tarnished.

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:39.279
Remember, it's not all about you.

00:07:39.279 --> 00:07:42.040
It's what is good for the work.

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:43.519
So that's the first lesson.

00:07:43.519 --> 00:07:47.000
Try to see the potential in others.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.920
Now if we turn across to Acts chapter 11,

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:54.079
this goes about nine years later,

00:07:54.079 --> 00:07:57.040
around the year 45 CE.

00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:00.120
Now in chapter 11 of Acts,

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:03.399
the work is going ahead in the Gentile field

00:08:03.399 --> 00:08:06.800
and particularly in the city of Antioch.

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:10.759
So Barnabas was assigned by the brothers

00:08:10.759 --> 00:08:14.879
to go and help the congregation in Antioch.

00:08:14.879 --> 00:08:18.279
Well, let's look down to verses 25 and 26

00:08:18.279 --> 00:08:20.759
because as soon as Barnabas arrived there,

00:08:20.759 --> 00:08:24.720
he realized he needed help.

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:26.720
So what did he do?

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:29.279
Well, in verse 25 it says,

00:08:29.279 --> 00:08:31.079
he, that's Barnabas,

00:08:31.079 --> 00:08:35.559
went to Tassus to make a thorough search for Saul.

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:39.200
So he went to find Saul.

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:42.759
He remembered this as a man who could speak Greek

00:08:42.759 --> 00:08:45.080
and was well educated.

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:48.440
He'd be able to help him with the Gentile field.

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:51.120
It's interesting that when you look at a map,

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:55.279
you'll notice that it's about 120 miles

00:08:55.279 --> 00:08:59.679
from Antioch to Tassus or about 200 kilometers.

00:09:00.679 --> 00:09:02.320
It mentions here in verse 25,

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:04.080
he made a thorough search for Saul.

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:05.080
Why?

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:07.399
Well, if we compare first Corinthians

00:09:07.399 --> 00:09:09.840
where Paul lists all the things he did,

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:14.840
many of those, it appears happened in those nine years.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.799
He was shipwrecked several times,

00:09:16.799 --> 00:09:18.320
put it into prison and so on.

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:20.440
So he was very busy.

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:22.559
Barnabas sought him out.

00:09:22.559 --> 00:09:23.840
And then what did he have to do?

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:25.639
Well, in verse 26 it says,

00:09:25.639 --> 00:09:30.200
after he found him, he brought him to Antioch.

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:31.399
So what did he have to do?

00:09:31.399 --> 00:09:34.080
He had to convince Saul.

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:36.240
You can imagine that might have been a little difficult

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:39.399
because Saul was having productive ministry.

00:09:39.399 --> 00:09:41.679
So he brought him to Antioch.

00:09:41.679 --> 00:09:43.519
Then verse 26 says,

00:09:43.519 --> 00:09:44.600
for a whole year,

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:47.480
they assembled with them in the congregation

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:50.159
and taught quite a crowd.

00:09:50.159 --> 00:09:53.159
So Barnabas didn't take Paul and say,

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:54.799
now I'm going to teach you,

00:09:54.799 --> 00:09:57.559
he just had him work along with him.

00:09:57.559 --> 00:09:59.360
And as they worked together,

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:01.879
that would have given Saul some training.

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:06.320
So what's the lesson that we learned?

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:08.080
Be willing to make the effort.

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:11.840
You see, Barnabas not only saw the potential,

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:14.879
but he was willing to go and find Saul,

00:10:14.879 --> 00:10:17.200
then convince him to come and work with him.

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:19.080
And then they worked together.

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:21.200
So that's the second lesson.

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:24.519
The third lesson is in Acts 13.

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:30.480
So after Barnabas and Saul were in Antioch for some time,

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:33.399
what happened in verse two?

00:10:33.399 --> 00:10:36.840
Says as they were ministering to Jehovah and fasting,

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:39.080
the Holy Spirit said,

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:42.600
set aside for me Barnabas and Saul

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.720
for the work to which I have called them.

00:10:45.759 --> 00:10:48.360
Well now this is the time when they're going out

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:50.159
in their missionary field.

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:55.480
But notice the Holy Spirit mentions Barnabas and Saul.

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:58.559
So in this illustration, we see who's taking the lead.

00:10:58.559 --> 00:11:02.159
Barnabas, Saul's following along.

00:11:02.159 --> 00:11:06.799
But if we look down further in verse 13 of the same chapter,

00:11:06.799 --> 00:11:08.720
we see there's a little change.

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:12.559
Saul starts to use a name that is more common in that area.

00:11:12.559 --> 00:11:14.639
Paul, but what does it say?

00:11:14.639 --> 00:11:18.399
Now Paul and his companions would have to see.

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:22.720
And from here on, it seems that Paul took the lead.

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:26.360
Now let's just imagine for a little bit

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:27.840
that you were Barnabas.

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:30.240
Maybe we could imagine ourselves saying

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:32.360
quietly to Saul or Paul,

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:34.720
whatever he was calling himself at that time.

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:37.720
Can I just have a few words with you?

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:42.360
This is not a big issue, but remember when Holy Spirit said

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:46.320
we were going out, it was Barnabas and Saul.

00:11:47.159 --> 00:11:50.080
Now I don't have a big problem with this,

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:53.440
but I appreciate your enthusiasm,

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:57.679
but really I was the one designed to take the lead here.

00:11:57.679 --> 00:11:59.519
Now he didn't say that, did he?

00:11:59.519 --> 00:12:04.519
The Bethara Witness book mentions he wasn't envious at all.

00:12:04.799 --> 00:12:06.320
So what's the lesson?

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:10.039
Well, if we're working along with someone

00:12:10.039 --> 00:12:15.039
and training them, the lesson is don't be envious.

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:17.879
If they start to excel,

00:12:17.879 --> 00:12:20.120
and actually what we're hoping them to do

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:23.320
is to blossom and they get some of the privileges

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:26.240
that perhaps we would have liked along the way.

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:29.799
So we won't be saying, well, excuse me,

00:12:29.799 --> 00:12:32.559
but I'm the one who went through Gilead.

00:12:32.559 --> 00:12:35.120
No, we won't be envious.

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:40.159
The fourth lesson takes us to the book of Galatians.

00:12:40.159 --> 00:12:44.519
So if you turn with me to Galatians, chapter two.

00:12:44.519 --> 00:12:47.519
And this is around the year 49 CE.

00:12:48.639 --> 00:12:53.159
Already, Peter and Paul and Barnabas and Titus

00:12:53.159 --> 00:12:55.039
had all been to Jerusalem

00:12:55.039 --> 00:12:56.919
and they had had the big discussion

00:12:56.919 --> 00:12:59.240
with the governing body about circumcision.

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:03.000
Interestingly, when they arrived in Jerusalem,

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.519
the account says Barnabas and Paul were there, interesting.

00:13:07.519 --> 00:13:09.559
Maybe Barnabas took note of that,

00:13:09.559 --> 00:13:11.559
that he was mentioned first again,

00:13:11.559 --> 00:13:13.759
probably because the governing body remembered

00:13:13.799 --> 00:13:17.320
that was actually the role originally.

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:21.159
But now we find that Peter, Paul, and Barnabas

00:13:21.159 --> 00:13:23.960
and some others were back in Antioch

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:28.159
and what happened just a few months after that special meeting.

00:13:28.159 --> 00:13:33.159
Well, Paul had to tell Peter he was doing something wrong.

00:13:33.399 --> 00:13:36.000
But notice please, what verse 13 says?

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:39.639
The rest of the Jews also joined him

00:13:39.639 --> 00:13:41.720
in putting on this pretense

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:46.279
so that even Barnabas was let along with them in their pretense.

00:13:46.279 --> 00:13:48.120
Now, I just love this picture.

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:51.639
You see, Paul telling Peter he's wrong

00:13:51.639 --> 00:13:53.440
and you look, have a look at that.

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:56.159
Look on Barnabas face it.

00:13:56.159 --> 00:13:58.000
He looks guilty.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.799
Oh, words.

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:04.440
You see, he was caught in the crossfire.

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:07.639
He likewise was getting counsel

00:14:07.639 --> 00:14:10.200
because he was involved with this.

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:14.039
So what lesson do we gain from this?

00:14:14.039 --> 00:14:15.879
Except counsel.

00:14:15.879 --> 00:14:17.840
Even from those who we are viewing

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:20.440
as the ones who were training.

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:23.720
Don't feel that we're above accepting counsel.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.080
Now, the final lesson is the one,

00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:29.320
probably you thought about immediately

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:31.120
when we mentioned Paul and Barnabas.

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:33.480
I know what you were thinking, Acts 15.

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:35.240
So let's turn them.

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:40.240
Acts 15 and verses 37 to 39.

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:46.190
And this is after the incident in Antioch

00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:50.629
and it says Barnabas was determined to take along John

00:14:50.629 --> 00:14:52.870
who was called Mark.

00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:55.149
Paul, however, was not in favor

00:14:55.149 --> 00:14:57.110
of taking him along with them,

00:14:57.110 --> 00:15:00.110
seeing that he had departed from them in Pamphilia

00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:03.029
and had not gone with them to the work.

00:15:03.029 --> 00:15:07.029
At this, there was a sharp burst of anger

00:15:07.029 --> 00:15:09.350
so that they separated from each other.

00:15:10.629 --> 00:15:13.230
Now, this is the instance that we usually remember

00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:15.710
when we think of Paul and Barnabas.

00:15:16.629 --> 00:15:18.470
What led to this problem?

00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:20.750
Have you ever thought about that?

00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:23.429
It mentions that Paul was very hesitant

00:15:23.429 --> 00:15:26.669
about taking John Mark along with them.

00:15:26.669 --> 00:15:30.269
Perhaps he remembered on that first missionary tour

00:15:30.269 --> 00:15:32.230
when John Mark had gone back,

00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:35.750
he and Barnabas continued on into Galatia

00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:38.190
and reading what Paul said to the Galatians.

00:15:38.190 --> 00:15:42.309
It seems obvious that Paul had problems with his eyes

00:15:42.309 --> 00:15:45.070
and he was very sick at that point.

00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:48.710
So no doubt, you know, he missed having a young man

00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:50.750
available to carry the luggage

00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:53.710
to do all the things that needed to be done.

00:15:53.710 --> 00:15:58.710
So part of us can understand why Paul was hesitant.

00:15:58.870 --> 00:16:01.629
He didn't want to lose the help again.

00:16:01.629 --> 00:16:03.669
But then on the other hand, what about Barnabas?

00:16:03.669 --> 00:16:08.230
Why do you think he was so determined to take John Mark?

00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:11.470
Well, it could be the fact that he was a relative

00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:14.389
that sometimes comes into a factor

00:16:14.389 --> 00:16:18.470
or it could be that the fact that Barnabas saw

00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:22.990
the potential in Saul is the same thing he saw in John Mark.

00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:24.950
This is a good young man.

00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:26.750
We need to give him a chance.

00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:30.909
Or could it be that he was still stinging

00:16:30.909 --> 00:16:33.950
a little bit after the rebuke in Antioch?

00:16:34.950 --> 00:16:39.950
Or could it be that he was still viewing Saul or Paul

00:16:41.029 --> 00:16:44.509
as a student, someone you're in the truth in him

00:16:44.509 --> 00:16:46.909
and someone that he just found it hard

00:16:46.909 --> 00:16:49.549
to accept his opinion?

00:16:49.549 --> 00:16:52.549
Now, we're not going to play the blame game.

00:16:53.830 --> 00:16:56.590
Some of us will be working with these brothers later.

00:17:03.379 --> 00:17:06.980
But I feel safe in saying this.

00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:10.740
I'm sure that Paul and Barnabas,

00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:13.299
when they think back to that day,

00:17:13.299 --> 00:17:15.900
would agree they could have done things better.

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:17.339
Is that a safe comment?

00:17:17.339 --> 00:17:20.579
I think all of us have things we've felt.

00:17:20.579 --> 00:17:24.500
Maybe we were right, but we could have handled it better.

00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:26.740
So what's the lesson?

00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:29.500
Try to respect different opinions.

00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:31.900
Don't overreact.

00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:33.380
Don't get upset.

00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:36.579
Try to work through things so that it doesn't affect

00:17:36.579 --> 00:17:38.259
our working relationship.

00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:43.180
Well, when we've thought about Barnabas and Paul,

00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:45.980
it really gives us a lot of food for thought, doesn't it?

00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:48.140
Remember those five lessons?

00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:51.500
Try to see the potential in others.

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:54.779
Then be willing to put for the effort

00:17:54.779 --> 00:17:56.900
that's required to train them.

00:17:56.900 --> 00:18:00.059
Don't be envious if they get privileges.

00:18:00.059 --> 00:18:02.619
Except counsel if they offer you counsel

00:18:02.619 --> 00:18:05.700
and respect their opinions as well.

00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:10.220
We know that you'll try to implement those suggestions.

00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:13.700
Yes, as you go to your assignments,

00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:16.900
may your hover be with you and bless you,

00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:20.579
may you try to help others by sharing what you've learned

00:18:20.579 --> 00:18:22.779
at Gilead, and in that way,

00:18:22.779 --> 00:18:25.900
you will fulfill the purpose of Gilead

00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:28.940
to stabilize and strengthen others.
