00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:13.490
Well, when I was a teenager, I didn't see any benefit in talking to my parents because

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.570
they like different things than I like.

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:22.489
So I thought I was the point and I also wanted to be an adult.

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:25.769
I wanted to feel like an adult and be treated like an adult.

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.769
I remember when my mom used to pick me up from school.

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.530
She wanted to show personal interest in me so she asked me, oh, how are your friends

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:33.530
doing?

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:34.530
How was school today?

00:00:34.609 --> 00:00:35.810
Do you have a little homework?

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:39.369
But I just thought that she was being nosy.

00:00:39.369 --> 00:00:44.369
I always had my earphones on and whenever my parents were trying to talk to me, that was

00:00:44.369 --> 00:00:49.130
my chance to just pop them in and ignore them.

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.329
The way my parents grew up wasn't the same way that I grew up.

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:53.890
They grew up in a different country.

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:55.570
They spoke a different language.

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.979
They grew up in a different time.

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:03.939
When you're talking to somebody who doesn't speak your language natively, oftentimes you

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:06.420
won't be able to explain things from your heart.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.019
And so I had that challenge.

00:01:08.019 --> 00:01:11.379
I wasn't able to talk directly to my parents' heart to heart.

00:01:11.379 --> 00:01:16.819
And so there was always this frustration in trying to really convey how I felt.

00:01:16.819 --> 00:01:19.939
And I felt like it wasn't really getting through to my parents.

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:23.659
When I went to my first pioneer school, I learned a lot about Jehovah's qualities and

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:27.900
one of them was how he was a very approachable person.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.140
And I thought to myself, am I approachable person?

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:38.060
And I thought about how I acted in the ministry and then in the meetings and then at home.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.340
And I realized at home, I had a lot of things I needed to fix.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.219
I felt like it was two different worlds I was living in.

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:46.859
One was when I was at school with my peers.

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:52.500
I felt like I was understood and at home, I kind of just withdrew to myself.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.260
I wouldn't try to communicate with them because it didn't seem worth the effort.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.739
I tried to figure out problems in my own way.

00:01:58.739 --> 00:02:04.700
It was kind of a trial and error.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:10.060
I developed a lot of bad habits that today I'm still trying to overcome.

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.139
If I was able to communicate with them more, if I was able to connect with them and ask

00:02:15.139 --> 00:02:19.539
for their help and get their support and have them on my team, things would have went

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:21.139
a lot better.

00:02:21.139 --> 00:02:23.139
And I really wish I did.

00:02:23.139 --> 00:02:28.379
Jesus, who was a perfect human being and who had perfect judgment, didn't make decisions

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:29.379
on his own.

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:32.259
He always looked for his father for guidance.

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:36.180
And I got me thinking, well, if Jesus did that, it has to be something good in it for

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.180
me too.

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.379
What really helped me was Colossians 4-6.

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:43.979
I knew I needed to speak more gracious in the family.

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:49.740
And I realized that I was speaking very defensively and I needed to be more approachable to my

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:50.740
parents.

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:55.300
When I first tried to talk with them, of course, it was awkward and I didn't want to talk

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.780
about anything personal because I was in use to it.

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:04.340
So I thought I could maybe ask them about them, ask them how their day was and what they

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:05.580
like for meetings.

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.740
So I just try to show more interest in them instead of focusing on myself.

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:13.460
And I think that's what got the conversation going and got me comfortable to really talk

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:14.460
with them.

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:20.900
I was so focused on how my parents weren't understanding me that I wasn't really trying

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.500
to understand them.

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.539
When I thought about my parents, I thought about how much work it takes to be a parent.

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:33.419
From when I was a baby, for many years, they were working day and night to try to care

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:34.419
for me.

00:03:34.419 --> 00:03:37.979
They never demanded a thank you or anything for me.

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:40.500
They were really self-sacrificing.

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.139
And I imagined if I had to work that much for somebody.

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:49.340
How would I feel if they didn't really say thank you?

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:54.460
Or how would I feel if this person who I worked so hard for didn't really view me as their

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:55.460
friend?

00:03:55.539 --> 00:04:02.419
Later on as I got older and started that communication going with my parents, I realized taking their

00:04:02.419 --> 00:04:07.939
advice and really listening to their opinions and always letting them know what I'm going

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:13.460
to do and where I'm going to go was a mature thing to do.

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:18.660
Our heart oftentimes takes the driver's seat and it directs us to where it thinks it

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.060
should go.

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.819
And oftentimes it goes in the wrong direction and we sometimes get hurt.

00:04:25.819 --> 00:04:28.420
Then we look back and say I wish I didn't do that.

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:30.500
And our parents have been there.

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:36.019
What they're trying to do for us now is to tell us, don't let your heart take the driver's

00:04:36.019 --> 00:04:37.019
seat.

00:04:37.019 --> 00:04:42.779
If I can talk to my teenage self, I would tell myself to see my mom and dad more like

00:04:42.779 --> 00:04:47.899
coaches because I used to think they were always trying to criticize me and point out my

00:04:47.899 --> 00:04:54.339
faults but really they're just trying to help me and they want me to have a happy life.

00:04:54.339 --> 00:04:58.779
I really wish I knew that as a teenager but I'm glad I learned that now.
