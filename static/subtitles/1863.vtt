00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:10.300
So when I saw my son for the first time, I saw his big eyes open, I just thought, Johova, what a blessing he's given to me.

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:16.300
I couldn't believe that this was our boy, it was overwhelming.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:22.300
When I was told that Jaden is autistic, I didn't know what it was.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.300
So I immediately started doing my homework.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:30.300
I need to know what it is so I can succeed because I love this boy.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.299
And I don't want to fail him.

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:39.299
Being a new mom, I started doing the research and talking to a pediatrician.

00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:47.299
Every day was like a mystery and you need that time to process together and we're like, you know, okay now what do we do?

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:57.299
It was key to talk to Johova because this can be overwhelming, just trying to understand the challenges that you have to prepare yourself for

00:00:57.299 --> 00:01:01.299
to endure as an advocate for your child.

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:17.299
I think being present and in our case has been very important with Jaden because there's just glimpses of his personality that you're able to capture and you might not see it again.

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:21.299
So those are the things that drive us.

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:27.299
We've been fortunate enough to have such a strong set of friends.

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.299
They're the ones that call us and say, how are you doing?

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:37.299
You know, outside of Jaden, how are you doing?

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:40.299
What's keeping you going?

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:49.299
You know, those are the things that really stay with us and help us just keep moving along and showing you long.

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:59.299
Jaden's vocabulary is limited. If he's angry, we ask him, are you feeling angry? Yes, angry. Well, why?

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:03.299
I don't know. Okay. Well, what happened?

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:12.300
I'll take a picture with my phone. You see, you don't look happy. And he said, I'm like, why? He'll slowly let it out, you know.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:20.300
And then I'll find a picture of my phone with him happy. I'm like, that's Jaden right there. And then we work at it.

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.300
But I think it helps him to see it because he sees himself.

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:33.699
And with Jaden reading words, writing words is not really the thing that's going to cement anything into his heart or brain.

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:39.699
So most of it is going to be drawn or acted out. Thank goodness we have so much video content now.

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:47.699
And he loves the Sophia and Kayla videos. When that came, we were just so grateful to Jehovah because it really felt like it was made for us.

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:54.699
We had the illustrated Bible stories. It had dialogue, an action tile. I would act those out with him.

00:02:54.699 --> 00:03:03.699
When we prepare for assembly, we sing the songs throughout the whole program so that he feels that he has an idea of what's coming.

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:14.699
We were serving in Spanish congregation, but we realized we need to move to the English congregation so that Jaden could thrive.

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:23.699
It's been a fun ride with getting Jaden to comment at meetings, telling the friends, hey, you know, he wants to comment, but it's going to be maybe something you don't understand.

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:29.699
And they were so good about it that constant support was enough for him to want to do it on his own.

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:34.699
So he knows that we have to share our faith. He knows that others don't have our hope.

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:39.699
Our ministry is part of our life, so that means we're publishers to get that done. So we help them to get to that place.

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:50.509
He's going to talk about his faith. He's going to share it the way he can. He wants to get baptized.

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:59.509
Yeah, I think that, you know, when we make it to the New World, he's going to know everything that's been done to get us there and to be there as a family.

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:03.719
Peace.

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:31.490
I think of us being over hill for some reason and think of him being between us because that's how he's kind of the dynamic.

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:40.490
Him holding us and saying we did it. We did it together. Jehovah is giving us the best gift, which is our son, Jaden.
