00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:09.480
In the printed comments on today's text, the reference is made to Matthew 25 and Luke 19.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:16.640
In Matthew 25, we have the illustration of the Talents, three slaves who received Talents,

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:23.059
one slave receives five, another two, and the third slave receives one Talent.

00:00:23.059 --> 00:00:30.780
And in Luke 19, the illustration is about ten slaves with each slave receiving one minor.

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:35.740
These are all sums of money, you could say, Talents or the Minas.

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:42.020
Both illustrations were given some days before Jesus died, and they were given in different

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:43.020
places.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.259
The illustration about the Minas was given in Jericho.

00:00:46.259 --> 00:00:50.700
The illustration about the Talents, a Talents that Jesus gave to his apostles on the Mount

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.500
of Olives.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.020
But there's a key point in each illustration that we'll focus on.

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:03.979
The slave in each account who did nothing with his Talent or his minor is described as

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:04.980
wicked.

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:11.879
That's a powerful denunciation for someone to be called wicked, particularly by the

00:01:11.879 --> 00:01:13.640
master.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:20.379
But to see how powerful it is, it Matthew, chapter 6, verse 13, Jesus refers to Satan

00:01:20.459 --> 00:01:23.299
as the wicked one.

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:28.579
And Proverbs 107 says the name of the wicked will rot.

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:33.780
So that is a very strong term to apply to any human.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.019
But why?

00:01:35.019 --> 00:01:39.099
Why are these two slaves described as wicked?

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:42.579
Jesus didn't say they broke any of the ten commandments?

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:43.579
No.

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:47.459
But they did something that was extremely serious.

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:54.060
They failed to do something with the Talents or the Minas that they were given.

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.299
They were guilty of sins of omission.

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:02.459
In Jesus' parable, just to give you an example of the sheep in the goats in Matthew chapter

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:09.099
25, verses 41 through 46, you remember the account how the goats are condemned to everlasting

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:11.580
cutting off.

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.659
Not for doing something bad.

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:16.979
The Scripture says they didn't help Christ's brothers.

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:23.900
Again, it was a sin of omission, not doing something that they should have done.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.979
It's also interesting to note that in Matthew's account, the Talents were given to the slaves

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:30.860
according to their ability.

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:36.060
So one received five, one received two, and the third one, one Talent.

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.659
Was the Master being partial?

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:38.659
No.

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:39.659
Not at all.

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:46.180
The account explains clearly the Talents were given to the slaves according to their ability.

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.580
So that was really being considered on the part of the Master, the way he apportioned the

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:56.460
responsibilities to work for his interest, to increase his belongings.

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:00.979
And you know that's a very comforting thought for all of us, to realize that Jehovah takes

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:09.180
into account what we can do, not comparing us with others in the congregation.

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:16.819
You have to be careful about feeling worthless or devalue our own worth because that can happen.

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:21.180
We can feel we just can't ever do enough to please Jehovah God, or there's just too much

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.180
going on.

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:28.340
No, we just have to do whatever we are able to do and give our best to Jehovah God.

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:33.500
And we never want to fall into the trap that the sluggish and wicked slave fell into.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.939
If you recall the account, he started to criticize the Master.

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:39.180
I know that you reap or you haven't sowed.

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.539
I know that you do this or that, you're harsh.

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:47.539
He was really placing the blame on the Master for his own inactivity, for what he didn't

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:49.020
do.

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:52.180
But the Master turned the tables on him and he said, you say, I'm that way?

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:53.460
Well now, wicked slave.

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:57.020
And then he told them that he wasn't going to receive anything.

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:00.180
He was categorized as wicked.

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:05.539
So as long as we give our best, we give from the heart and Jehovah is going to bless us.

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:08.139
And there's another interesting thing, too, with the slaves.

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:12.379
The one slave that received five talents and the one that received two talents.

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:15.300
The one that received two talents gained two talents.

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:17.819
The one that received five gained five.

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:22.579
But the one that had two and gained only two didn't look at the one that gained five

00:04:22.579 --> 00:04:24.939
and say, I can't do what he did.

00:04:24.939 --> 00:04:26.779
I only received two talents.

00:04:26.779 --> 00:04:30.980
No, he was just happy with what he had.

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:32.819
Isn't that a good lesson for us?

00:04:32.819 --> 00:04:38.139
Be happy with you, with what you're able to do if you can reach out and do more?

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:39.139
Wonderful.

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:40.139
Do it.

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:41.939
But we don't want to start comparing.

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:45.339
I can't keep up with him or with her.

00:04:45.339 --> 00:04:50.660
That's just a bad, bad idea that will not benefit anyone.

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:56.379
And what did the Master say to the slave who gained five talents, total of ten talents?

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:59.500
And that was a fortune in those days.

00:04:59.779 --> 00:05:05.939
Well, let's see what the Scripture says, Matthew 25,

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:08.420
Matthew 25, verse 21.

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:13.699
And these are the words of the Master to the slave who gained five talents, verse 21.

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:15.620
His Master said to him,

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.420
Well done, good and faithful slave.

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:21.060
You were faithful over a few things.

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.579
I will appoint you over many things.

00:05:23.579 --> 00:05:26.459
Enter into the joy of your Master.

00:05:26.459 --> 00:05:29.259
What a reward from the Master.

00:05:29.259 --> 00:05:37.019
But what did he say to the slave who gained only two talents, verse 23?

00:05:37.019 --> 00:05:38.860
His Master said to him,

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.180
Well done, good and faithful slave.

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.379
You were faithful over a few things.

00:05:43.379 --> 00:05:45.500
I will appoint you over many things.

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.579
Enter into the joy of your Master.

00:05:48.579 --> 00:05:50.019
Same, same.

00:05:50.019 --> 00:05:51.899
Isn't that what it is?

00:05:51.899 --> 00:05:54.220
It was according to each one's ability.

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:59.420
The reward in each case was the same, the approval of the Master

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:03.180
and undoubtedly additional responsibilities.

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:06.139
But simply the Master is Jesus Christ,

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:09.180
the talents refer to the responsibility

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:13.060
that Jehovah gives to his anointed servants.

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:15.579
They have to preach and make disciples.

00:06:15.579 --> 00:06:18.459
That commission was given to the anointed.

00:06:18.459 --> 00:06:19.660
We have the other sheep.

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:21.980
We've got the responsibility to do the same thing,

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:25.339
but that illustration was directed truly to the anointed.

00:06:25.339 --> 00:06:29.100
But there is a scripture that helps us to appreciate what we need to do.

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:34.620
And it's in Revelation, chapter 21 or 22.

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:38.779
Revelation, chapter 22, verse 17.

00:06:38.779 --> 00:06:41.899
It's not directly connected to the talents,

00:06:41.899 --> 00:06:45.500
but it does give us direction on what we all should do,

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:48.180
whether we're of the anointed or of the other sheep.

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:51.100
Revelation 22 17 says,

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:53.899
And the Spirit and the bride keep on saying,

00:06:53.899 --> 00:06:57.339
Come and let anyone hearing say,

00:06:57.339 --> 00:06:59.180
Come, well, that would be anyone hearing

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:00.779
we of the other sheep.

00:07:00.779 --> 00:07:02.699
Because the bride, we know who the bride is,

00:07:02.699 --> 00:07:05.500
the bride, the anointed, brothers of Christ.

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:08.459
And then it says, and let anyone thirsting come,

00:07:08.459 --> 00:07:11.980
let anyone who wishes take life's water free.

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:14.379
Well, the Spirit says, Come.

00:07:14.379 --> 00:07:16.220
Yes, indeed.

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:20.220
At Pentecost, Holy Spirit was poured upon 120 disciples.

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:22.300
They could go out and speak other languages.

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:25.819
They were sharing the good news, the hope with Jews

00:07:25.819 --> 00:07:27.660
in Jerusalem at that time.

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:31.259
The Holy Spirit inspired men to write the scriptures.

00:07:31.259 --> 00:07:34.620
Holy Spirit is behind the prophecies that we read in the Bible.

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:38.620
And the Holy Spirit is saying, Come, it doesn't it?

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:41.420
When you read a scripture to someone about the time of the end,

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:43.980
second Timothy three or other scriptures.

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:46.379
And they say, That's what's taking place today.

00:07:47.339 --> 00:07:49.579
Come on, come.

00:07:49.579 --> 00:07:52.860
The Holy Spirit is nudging, urging people

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:55.579
when they read God's word and they understand it

00:07:55.579 --> 00:07:57.579
and they accept what it says.

00:07:57.579 --> 00:07:59.259
It says, Come.

00:07:59.259 --> 00:08:00.939
And what about the bride?

00:08:00.939 --> 00:08:05.100
Well, the bride's been saying, Come, for a long time.

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:08.860
120 disciples Pentecost.

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:11.500
They went down, they preached in different languages

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:14.620
and they were saying to the Jews there, Come.

00:08:14.699 --> 00:08:16.540
And then down through the centuries,

00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:18.779
we know the few there may have been of the bride class,

00:08:18.779 --> 00:08:21.899
did their best to serve Jehovah and honor him.

00:08:21.899 --> 00:08:26.459
But in these last days is where it has really expanded

00:08:26.459 --> 00:08:30.699
tremendously with the bride saying, Come, think about it.

00:08:30.699 --> 00:08:35.580
From 120 disciples at Pentecost and preaching in one city

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:38.940
in this case, Jerusalem, the work of the bride

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:44.539
has increased to 8,220,105 disciples.

00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:50.299
In 240 lands, has the bride been saying, Come,

00:08:50.299 --> 00:08:51.500
absolutely.

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:54.059
And from one congregation at Pentecost,

00:08:54.059 --> 00:08:58.220
you could call the 120 disciples a congregation,

00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:03.220
to 118,016 congregations worldwide.

00:09:05.019 --> 00:09:08.259
The master Jesus must be very happy,

00:09:08.259 --> 00:09:11.100
joyful to see that his obedient slaves

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:15.179
have truly covered the earth with the kingdom message,

00:09:15.179 --> 00:09:17.980
what a privilege we have to share in that work.
