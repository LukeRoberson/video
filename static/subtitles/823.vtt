00:00:01.679 --> 00:00:08.179
In January of 2020, we started seeing news reports about a disease outbreak in Wuhan, China.

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:12.980
Now at the time, it seemed localized and was not a global concern.

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:18.679
But a short time later, the numbers were going up as the virus began to spread.

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:22.679
Borders were closing, and airports were shutting down.

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:33.850
On January 22nd, the Coordinators Committee received their first letter from a branch about the coronavirus.

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:39.850
The letter was from the Korea branch. Soon after that, we wrote to all branches in and around Asia,

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.350
and included guidelines on what to do if they had an outbreak in their territory.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.850
We had dealt with local epidemics before, but nothing like this on a worldwide scale.

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:55.850
It was clear that the virus is going to affect almost every aspect of our theocratic operations.

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:01.850
And during those first few months of 2020, the organization would be faced with a huge amount of decisions.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:07.849
You have to realize that this was catching us right in the middle of our activities.

00:01:07.849 --> 00:01:11.849
Our schedule for the whole year had already been planned.

00:01:11.849 --> 00:01:18.349
We had shepherding visits to branches, regional conventions, even special conventions.

00:01:18.349 --> 00:01:24.349
And now, we had Gilead graduation and memorial coming up right in front of us.

00:01:24.349 --> 00:01:26.349
What were we going to do?

00:01:26.849 --> 00:01:39.349
One of the first things the governing body decided was that the Coordinators Committee would become the central channel of communication regarding COVID-19.

00:01:39.349 --> 00:01:47.349
Meanwhile, the graduation of the 148th Class of Gilead was in two weeks.

00:01:47.349 --> 00:01:55.849
Should we have guests come? Should there be a live audience? There was not much time to make these decisions.

00:01:56.349 --> 00:02:09.349
However, after prayer and discussion, the entire governing body decided not to have a live audience for the Gilead graduation that weekend.

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:12.349
That was unheard of.

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:17.349
The next thing we needed to figure out was whether to lock down headquarters at Bethel.

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:21.849
I clearly remember it was a Friday night, March 13th.

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:26.349
We were getting reports of COVID cases in the congregations around Bethel.

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:31.849
And we also knew that the Bethelites would be going out to their congregation and other activities over the weekend.

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:36.349
If we were going to do something, we needed to do it quickly.

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:41.849
We called each member of the governing body and explained the situation.

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:47.849
And all were unanimous that we should lock down Bethel immediately.

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:54.349
So within the hour, a message went to the entire headquarters in the United States Bethel family to stay in.

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:58.349
And if you were out, to return to Bethel immediately.

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:04.349
Sometime later, we learned that there were some COVID cases at Patterson.

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:12.349
If we had moved ahead, potentially, we could have spread COVID through the whole Bethel family.

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:17.349
We really felt Jehovah's protective hand.

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:23.349
The same weekend as the Gilead graduation, the Memorial invitation campaign was scheduled to begin.

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:29.349
And so branches were asking, is it safe to go door to door and to distribute invitations?

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:31.849
What if we can't meet in our kingdom halls?

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:41.849
As the virus had spread in many countries, it became evident that we needed to suspend the public ministry.

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:46.849
This was a very serious decision.

00:03:46.849 --> 00:04:00.849
But when we prayerfully analyzed the situation, we realized we would not be showing respect for the sanctity of life or love of neighbor if we continued house to house.

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:06.849
Our preaching work shifted to letter writing and telephone witnessing.

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:10.849
And what a huge witness has been given in this way.

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:19.850
It was amazing to me personally when I saw how quickly the brothers could adapt to using Zoom, phone witnessing, letter writing.

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:25.850
And instead of it being a huge setback for the work, it was almost as though the work even moved ahead.

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:31.850
We were also having to deal with what to do about our kingdom halls and our meetings.

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:39.850
Initially, some of the brothers were thinking, maybe we could just simply watch the pre-recorded meetings on JW Stream.

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:53.850
Well, while that's an excellent provision, if we were going to do this for a long time, it would be wonderful to use a tool that would allow the brothers and sisters to come together virtually,

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:58.850
to be able to interact and have that interchange of encouragement.

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:11.850
We knew that a few branches had already started using Zoom for congregation meetings, and we wondered, could this tool be used for congregation meetings globally?

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:16.850
So we asked those branches for their recommendations on how we could use this tool further.

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:23.850
We got their comments, we did some testing, and then the governing body approved the global use of Zoom for meetings.

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:29.850
At the same time though, the coordinators committee urgently wanted to help those congregations to arrange dignified Zoom meetings.

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:35.850
And so within a week, technical and theocratic guidelines were released to all congregations.

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:44.850
Then shortly after that, tens of thousands of Zoom licenses were purchased and then provided to many congregations as part of the disaster relief arrangement.

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:49.850
However, not all publishers could use Zoom due to lack of internet.

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:57.850
So in the days leading up to the campaign, the governing body provided direction to all branches and how to handle those exact situations.

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:03.850
They also announced that the memorial talk itself would be made available on JW.org.

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:08.850
So one branch wrote in and asked if they could use television and radio broadcasting.

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:11.850
And we thought, that's a good idea.

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:13.850
Let's try it.

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:23.850
Once we saw how well it worked in that country, television and radio were approved for all branches in Africa only two days before the memorial.

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:36.850
How thrilling it was for many friends in Africa to find out even moments before the broadcast began that they would be able to commemorate the memorial simultaneously with their brothers and sisters throughout the country.

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:43.850
To have the memorial without being able to meet together was so different for all of us.

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:57.850
Can you imagine for the 2021 memorial, there was an all-time peak of 21,367,603.

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:03.850
Clearly, we have seen Jehovah's blessing on these arrangements.

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:13.850
While all these new arrangements were being made at a rapid pace, the usual work of the coordinators committee office didn't stop because of the pandemic.

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:17.850
We still had to deal with the king of the north, persecuting our brothers.

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:22.850
We still had disasters and many other things to contend with.

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:31.850
In fact, we handled twice as many disasters in the 2020 service year in the middle of the pandemic than we did in 2018.

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:37.850
On a daily basis, we saw clear evidence that we are living in the last days.

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:46.850
We had to come up with guidelines to help branches determine what aspects of relief work could be postponed and at the same time ensure that urgent or necessary work went ahead safely.

00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:59.850
While there's no doubt that the pandemic complicated disaster relief efforts considerably, it was so faith strengthening to see that the governing body refused to allow those complications to prevent them from caring for our brothers.

00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:08.850
In addition to the impact these disasters had on our brothers, in some countries our brothers couldn't even get enough food for their daily needs.

00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:17.850
This could have been because of government restrictions, supply issues, or other circumstances that wouldn't allow the brothers to work.

00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:22.850
Literally, the branches had to arrange to provide their daily bread.

00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:29.850
The branches were encouraged to establish disaster relief committees to care for the needs on a local level.

00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:37.850
Reminders were provided to help families try to prepare a reserve of food if at all possible in case the situation became worse.

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:48.850
Of course, the virus affected not only our meetings at the Kingdom Hall, but also our circuit assemblies, regional conventions, and special conventions.

00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:57.850
For the governing body decided to cancel all live regional and special conventions for 2020.

00:08:57.850 --> 00:09:07.850
That led to a landmark convention program on JW.org that the entire brotherhood enjoyed.

00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:20.230
That same week in March, we approved that a JW broadcasting news release about the coronavirus outbreak be developed.

00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:33.230
So interviews and scripts were prepared during that Gilead graduation weekend, and the program was recorded and released the following week.

00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:44.230
The governing body updates have been an important way for us to shepherd the entire organization during the pandemic.

00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:48.230
Well, once vaccinations became more prevalent, we faced another challenge.

00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:54.230
The United States branch was struggling to get vaccines for those in the Bethel family who wanted them.

00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:59.230
So in early April 2021, we called together a meeting.

00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:06.230
We had all the key individuals there from the various departments, and everyone was given an assignment.

00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:16.230
And within two weeks, we had enough vaccine to vaccinate everyone in the US Bethel family who chose to be vaccinated.

00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:23.230
Well, about a week later, we sent a letter to all branches encouraging them to investigate the availability of vaccines for special full-time servants.

00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:31.230
We were especially concerned about special full-time servants serving in lands where the government was not yet making vaccines available.

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:43.230
After that direction went out, we had a tremendous response from a number of branches who were able to obtain vaccines for special full-time servants who wanted to receive them.

00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:50.230
Several branches said that it had seemed impossible to get vaccines in their country at that moment.

00:10:50.230 --> 00:11:03.230
But they prayed about it, they followed the direction, and then either that same day, or the very next day, Jehovah opened the doors, and suddenly they had the vaccine.

00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:05.230
All of these events occurred rapidly.

00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:17.230
And even though it was difficult to make so many adjustments in such a short period of time, we could see Jehovah's hand in the governing body's decisions.

00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:22.230
Television, radio, video conferencing have all served our brothers well.

00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:29.230
With just goes to show that Jehovah was guiding the governing body as they made these decisions so early in the pandemic.

00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:45.230
You know, we've always appreciated the direction we received from the faithful slave, but at that unique time, especially, it was so encouraging to see Jehovah use them to make these major decisions, and they made many that one week in March.

00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:56.230
Although there have been many challenges and sad times during the pandemic, it's been amazing to see many positive developments.

00:11:56.230 --> 00:12:04.230
So many inactive ones have returned. So many Bible studies have been started.

00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:21.230
We saw how Jehovah guided us through, decision by decision, step by step, and seeing how Jehovah led us through this situation has helped me to see that, regardless of what is going to come up in the future, Jehovah is going to do the same thing.

00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:30.230
Like scripture say, we get our plates. Yeah, those times, but overall, when you're in Jehovah's arms, what's the worry?

00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:50.230
You could say every one of the governing bodies faith was strengthened as we got through this trial, and it's just a continuous thing of our faith being built up and how Jehovah is directing us, and he's preparing his people for life in that new world. The real life is coming.

00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:56.230
It's been a real privilege to see Jehovah spirit in action during this pandemic.

00:12:56.230 --> 00:13:07.230
It strengthened our faith to see him use the governing body to provide scripturally based direction, keep the kingdom work going, and all the while showing respect for life.

00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:19.230
As a result, our trust in Jehovah's organization is stronger than ever before, and building this trust now is vital because Jehovah is preparing us for faith.

00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:24.230
It's important for us for future events, including the Great Tribulation.
