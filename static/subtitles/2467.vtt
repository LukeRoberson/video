00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:20.179
He still speaks through his faith.

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:21.980
Whoa.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.780
Have you read about Abel?

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:26.379
Even after 6,000 years,

00:00:26.379 --> 00:00:29.780
he still speaks to us through his faithful example.

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:31.780
That's incredible.

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.979
Especially considering his living situation.

00:00:34.979 --> 00:00:37.979
A lot of family drama.

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:41.579
Come on, let's take a look at that account.

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.579
Abel's parents were Adam and Eve.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:54.270
They disobeyed Jehovah and had to leave the paradise

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.450
that God made for them.

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.850
Abel also had a brother named Kane.

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.849
He was angry and violent.

00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:08.849
Abel's family were bad examples of faith.

00:01:08.849 --> 00:01:11.450
So how did Abel build his faith?

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:17.310
Well, there were cherubs who guarded the way to the garden

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.709
where his parents used to live.

00:01:19.709 --> 00:01:22.709
Abel could see other creatures who had faith in Jehovah.

00:01:22.709 --> 00:01:26.260
So he wasn't alone.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.459
Abel could enjoy the beautiful things Jehovah made

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:32.459
and know God loved him.

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:35.859
And Abel could think about Jehovah's promise

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:40.459
and hope that someday he'd live in paradise.

00:01:40.459 --> 00:01:44.659
Even though Abel had a family who did not love Jehovah,

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:50.060
he still saw and heard plenty to help him build faith in God.

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.730
That help Abel become Jehovah's friend.

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:00.530
Why not read Abel's story and let his accounts speak to you?

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:06.129
Make time every day to learn from Jehovah's friends.

00:02:06.129 --> 00:02:08.129
What do you think?

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:12.129
How did Abel show that he was Jehovah's friend?

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:16.330
How did Abel build his faith in Jehovah?

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.330
How could you build your faith?
