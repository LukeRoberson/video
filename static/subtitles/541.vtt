00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:05.070
Well, let's talk about the disfellowshiping arrangement.

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:09.109
To begin, it would be good to read the scriptural basis for disfellowshiping.

00:00:09.109 --> 00:00:14.509
It is found at 1 Corinthians chapter 5, so if you would like to open your Bibles there,

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:20.589
we will start reading with verse 9 of 1 Corinthians 5.

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:25.789
It says, and this is the Apostle Paul writing under inspiration, in my letter I wrote

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:30.670
you to stop keeping company with sexually immoral people.

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:36.149
Not meaning entirely with the sexually immoral people of this world, or the greedy people,

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:42.429
or extortioners, or idolaters, otherwise you would actually have to get out of the world.

00:00:42.429 --> 00:00:46.630
Well, Christians do not hold themselves a lieu from non-witnesses.

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:51.670
We have normal contacts with neighbors, workmates, schoolmates, and others, and we witness

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:52.670
to them.

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.909
Even if some of them are living immoral lives.

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:57.310
We cannot avoid them completely.

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:00.990
It is different though with a brother who lives like that.

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:06.469
Verse 11 continues, but now I am writing you to stop keeping company with anyone called

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:12.349
a brother who is sexually immoral, or a greedy person, or an idolater, or a reviler, or

00:01:12.349 --> 00:01:17.549
a drunkard, or an extortioner, not even eating with such a man.

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:25.510
And so at the end of verse 13, he adds, remove the wicked person from among yourselves.

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:32.629
Notice that this inspired instruction is worded as a command, not a suggestion.

00:01:32.629 --> 00:01:37.750
This matter was nicely explained in the article why disfellowshiping is a loving provision

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.390
in the April 15, 2015 issue of the watch tower.

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.709
It said, although Jehovah does not demand perfection from us, he does have a standard

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:49.989
of holiness that he expects his servants to meet.

00:01:49.989 --> 00:01:56.510
For example, Jehovah insists that we avoid such serious sins as sexual immorality, idolatry,

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:00.069
theory, extortion, murder, and spiritism.

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:04.030
Would you not agree that Jehovah's clean standards are reasonable and that they serve

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:05.709
to protect us?

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:10.710
Who does not prefer to live among peaceful, decent people who can be trusted?

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.229
We find such an environment among our spiritual brothers and sisters thanks to the promise

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:20.669
we make at the time of our dedication to God to live in harmony with the guidelines found

00:02:20.669 --> 00:02:22.870
in his word.

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:28.669
But now, what if a baptized Christian commits a serious sin?

00:02:28.669 --> 00:02:34.830
Does the congregation disfellowship people because they commit sexual immorality, idolatry,

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.229
theory, extortion, murder, spiritism, or something else?

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:42.469
Well, there's more to it than that.

00:02:42.469 --> 00:02:49.469
And the same article explains, two factors must coincide that result in the disfellowship

00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:51.750
being of one of Jehovah's witnesses.

00:02:51.750 --> 00:03:00.669
First, a baptized witness commits a serious sin, second, he does not repent of his sin.

00:03:00.669 --> 00:03:07.310
So individuals or disfellowship only when they are unrepentant of the sins they have committed,

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:12.430
and they cannot be reinstated into the congregation until the elders are convinced that they

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.750
are genuinely repentant.

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:20.909
Well, this presents a challenge to each of us when it is a beloved friend or relative

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:22.310
who is disfellowship.

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:27.550
Will we be submissive and yield to the judgment of the elders who handle the matter?

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:33.189
We should accept the fact that they are in a position to be more objective than we are.

00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:37.590
The elders pray hard about these decisions knowing that they will render an account to God.

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.270
And that's why they make every effort to recover the airing one if possible.

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:47.949
But if that fails, they must protect the congregation and keep it morally clean.

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:53.590
But even then, they kindly and clearly explain the steps needed to be reinstated, and they

00:03:53.590 --> 00:04:00.030
may periodically visit the disfellowship person to remind him or her of the way back to Jehovah.

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:07.270
Now, if we yield to and support the elders' judgment, we will actually be helping a

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:11.550
wrong-doer to benefit from the discipline as coming from Jehovah.

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:14.150
And that's so important for them to realize.

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:23.209
Look at Hebrews 12, starting with verse 5.

00:04:23.209 --> 00:04:28.209
It says, and you have entirely forgotten the exhortation that addresses you as sons.

00:04:28.209 --> 00:04:33.129
My son do not belittle the discipline from Jehovah, nor give up when you are corrected

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:34.449
by him.

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:37.129
For those whom Jehovah loves, he disciplines.

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:41.649
In fact, he scourges everyone whom he receives as a son.

00:04:41.649 --> 00:04:48.490
And then verse 11, true, no discipline seems for the present to be joyous, but it is painful.

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:54.569
Yet afterward, it yields a peaceable fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained

00:04:54.569 --> 00:04:56.329
by it.

00:04:56.329 --> 00:05:01.970
So for disileship ones who have been trained by the discipline, it has helped them to become

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:05.290
spiritually restored.

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:09.329
So what is the very best thing we can do for those who are disileship?

00:05:09.329 --> 00:05:12.610
We already read it in 1 Corinthians 5-11.

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:18.529
Stop keeping company with them, not even eating with them.

00:05:18.529 --> 00:05:24.329
And speaking of the same sort of person the Apostle John wrote at 2 John 10, do not receive

00:05:24.329 --> 00:05:28.490
him into your homes or say a greeting to him.

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:35.250
Now, our loyalty is on the line, not to the disileship person, but to God, who is watching

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:43.410
to see whether we will abide by his command, not to have contact with those who are disileship.

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:48.970
Some of Jehovah's people may think this is too drastic, and that they are keeping in contact

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:53.689
with the disileship friend or relative is a kindness.

00:05:53.689 --> 00:05:57.730
But they could not be more wrong about that.

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:03.769
You see, it may save their own feelings, but they would be doing the worst possible thing

00:06:03.769 --> 00:06:06.529
for the disfellowship person.

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:12.769
And Jesus did point out at Matthew 1119, wisdom is proved righteous by its results.

00:06:12.769 --> 00:06:17.810
We can share with you many fine examples of the good that has resulted when a family,

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:25.689
firmly and loyally upholds Jehovah's decree not to associate with disfellowship ones.

00:06:25.689 --> 00:06:32.689
One father said that when his son began behaving in a way that was unacceptable, his lifestyle

00:06:32.689 --> 00:06:34.810
had put up a barrier between them.

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:42.050
Now note the father recognized it was his son who had created the barrier, not Jehovah.

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:47.050
After some ten years, the young man cleaned up his life and returned to the congregation,

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:52.329
and he admitted, being disfellowship brought me face to face with the consequences of my

00:06:52.329 --> 00:06:57.329
lifestyle, I needed that sort of discipline.

00:06:57.329 --> 00:07:01.649
His father added, disfellowshiping is an arrangement that we need.

00:07:01.649 --> 00:07:06.930
One that helps us live according to Jehovah's standards, in the long run despite the pain,

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:09.050
it brings good results.

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:14.089
Had I been tolerant of my son's bag conduct, he would never have recovered.

00:07:14.089 --> 00:07:18.490
In another case, a sister admitted, cutting ourselves off completely from all association

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:23.689
with my disfellowship sister, tested our loyalty to God's arrangement, it gave us opportunity

00:07:23.689 --> 00:07:28.730
to show that we really believe that Jehovah's way is best.

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:33.529
And her reinstated sister later told her, if you had viewed the disfellowship lightly,

00:07:33.529 --> 00:07:39.850
I know that I would not have taken steps toward reinstatement as soon as I did.

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:44.529
Being totally cut off from loved ones and close contact with the congregation created

00:07:44.529 --> 00:07:50.610
a strong desire to repent, I realized just how wrong my course was and how serious it

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:54.610
was to turn my back on Jehovah.

00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:59.610
We should think of these comments, if ever we are tempted to violate God's command not

00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:03.810
to associate with disfellowship friends or relatives.

00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:09.610
The article I've quoted from also says, disfellowship ones who are no longer members of the congregation

00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:14.930
may come to realize what they have lost, the bitter fruits of their sinful course, together

00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:19.610
with the memories of happier days when they enjoyed a good relationship with Jehovah and

00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:23.410
his people could bring them to their senses.

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:29.370
Well, Jehovah knew what he was doing when he inspired the anointed apostles to write

00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:35.809
what they did about not having any contact with disfellowship wrongdoers.

00:08:35.809 --> 00:08:37.210
Let's always believe that.
