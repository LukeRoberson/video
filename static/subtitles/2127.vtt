00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:12.980
My parents were both Jehovah's Witnesses by the time I was born.

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:19.780
So I studied the Bible, attended meetings, and went out and surfaced with them.

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:25.059
Growing up in the truth, I knew that living by Bible standards is what's best for me.

00:00:25.059 --> 00:00:29.539
And my parents were always so zealous when it came to spiritual things.

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:35.450
So when I think back, I just didn't want to let them down.

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.530
Living by Bible principles is not burdensome or even that difficult.

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:45.850
Honestly, if we do as it says in the Bible, then we benefit ourselves.

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:51.289
But at times, I was curious how my life would be if I wasn't in the truth.

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:55.289
It was just so fun to be around my school friends.

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.329
Overall, I had a good time at school.

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:02.409
I got along with my classmates and my teachers like me too.

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:05.930
So being in school was a pretty good experience.

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.689
My parents always told me not to get too close to my classmates.

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:15.450
But in my opinion, my friends had good conduct and were good people.

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.010
I didn't understand why they were so worried.

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:24.129
In my high school, there were a lot of kids who went to church and many of the teachers

00:01:24.129 --> 00:01:26.450
had religious backgrounds.

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.969
One day, there was an incident when the entire school found out I was one of Jehovah's

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:32.450
witnesses.

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.329
I knew that some people might be prejudiced against witnesses, but I was surprised to see

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:40.609
how everyone could change so suddenly.

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:45.730
I started spending more time with my classmates, but the more I hung out with them, the more

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:49.049
I saw that we were living completely different lives.

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.010
Their conversations would be about trips they went on over the weekend and what they bought

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:55.049
on their latest shopping trip.

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.969
But when it came to me, all I had done was spiritual activities.

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:01.930
It felt like I was missing out.

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.689
I felt alone and like an outcast.

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:10.250
I knew in my head that Bible principles are right and beneficial.

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:16.360
But when I was actually put in that situation, I wasn't so sure anymore.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.360
I started to feel like I wasn't as cool as my classmates.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.680
So when they started to talk about their life goals, I couldn't bring myself to tell

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.240
them what my goals were.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:33.199
So I started thinking what would be the right way for me to act.

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:37.280
Opening up to my parents about my situation really helped.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.080
One day for family worship, we decided to discuss that topic.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.400
We read Matthew chapter 5 verse 11.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.560
Happy are you when people reproach you and persecute you and blindly say every sort of wicket

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.800
thing against you for my sake.

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.919
But how can you be happy when persecuted?

00:02:56.919 --> 00:03:00.800
I thought to myself, but I'm not happy right now.

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.840
My mom shared Mark 838 with me.

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.120
The part in the scripture where it says that if we are ashamed of Jesus Christ, he will

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.360
be ashamed of us really hit me.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:16.639
I realized that deep inside, I had been ashamed of being a witness.

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:21.280
While I was going through all of this, a brother gave a public talk in a congregation

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.599
and read Matthew chapter 19 verse 29.

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:30.159
There it says that everyone who has left what is important to them for the sake of Jehovah

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:33.280
will receive a hundred times as much.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.560
So I decided to try leaving what I thought was important to me and see what results and

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.280
blessings I might receive.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.479
About that time, my parents helped me to associate with brothers and sisters who were participating

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:52.680
in many different forms of full-time service so that I could hear their experiences.

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:57.280
It helped me to decide which direction I wanted to go in my life.

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.879
One thing that was really great about this decision was that I was able to meet many new

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:04.159
brothers and sisters.

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:10.120
I realized that there were so many people who had the same thoughts and goals as I did.

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.280
These were my true friends.

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:17.079
The next time the topic of our future goals came up with my classmates, I was able to speak

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:18.439
up confidently.

00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:23.600
I am really thankful to my parents who helped me to find the courage to do that.

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.959
I felt that Jehovah truly keeps his promises.

00:04:27.959 --> 00:04:34.279
Come to think of it, Jehovah has kept his promise to reward me a hundred times as much

00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:39.290
if I choose to live by the Bible's principles.

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:44.610
I am really happy now and I am confident that if I follow the Bible's teachings when

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.610
I make decisions, I will always have the best results.
