00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.500
Got it. I find the answers in all that.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.500
It's more than just the answers.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.699
And with it, I'm all about study.

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:33.149
Which do you remember more from our studies?

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:35.649
The answers?

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:38.149
Or the things that touch your heart?

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:42.850
Yeah.

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.850
Like, when we talked about immorality,

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.850
you knew the answer.

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.850
But you didn't seem totally convinced in here.

00:00:57.289 --> 00:00:58.789
Let's try and find that answer.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.980
But whoever practices sexual immorality

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.480
is sinning against his own body.

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:19.659
I'm not sure why.

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.010
It made me think of Mum and Dad.

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:27.510
His constant cheating, actually.

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.010
Mum's humiliation,

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.510
the divorce, all the misery.

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:35.010
I didn't want that.

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.370
I began to realise how right Jehovah is.

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.870
Because of what need to call meditation.

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:54.870
It's not about clearing your mind to find inner peace.

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:57.370
It's totally different.

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:02.370
It's asking how Jehovah feels about something.

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.370
And then what that means for me.
