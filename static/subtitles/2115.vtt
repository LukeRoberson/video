00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:07.360
Well, my experience as the Jehovah's Witnesses, which is actually our fairly extensive, is

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.880
they are mild-mannered.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:17.800
They are ardent, enthusiastic for their particular view, but so are many people in my experience.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:25.359
The idea that it is extremism to think your own religion is true and another one is false,

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:33.119
as being terrorism is to be frank absurd and would not be accepted in virtually any country

00:00:33.119 --> 00:00:34.560
that I can imagine.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:40.960
I completely agree with the view that it is the Russian government who are behaving

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:46.159
extremely in this situation and that there's nothing in the evidence that I've read in

00:00:46.159 --> 00:00:51.320
support of the charges brought against the Jehovah's Witnesses, which justify labeling

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.200
that as extremist.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:58.799
Only in Jehovah's Witnesses extremists can do nothing to enhance Russia's reputation

00:00:58.799 --> 00:01:00.799
as a civilized nation.

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:07.680
Any decision which is adverse to the Jehovah's Witnesses will affect others in the sense

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:14.079
that it will be a warning sign that if you fall out of line with whatever the Russian

00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:17.719
authorities view is, you will be in jeopardy.

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:24.319
It's a clear signal to do what you're told and to avoid expressing views or having

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:28.120
beliefs which the Russian state disagrees with.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:37.319
The message which this legislation gives about religious freedom in Russia is an entirely

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:38.760
negative one.

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.680
You can believe whatever you want so long as you believe what I tell you.

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:52.599
In my view, a shocking example of a bad law being used for a worse purpose.

00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:59.879
Clearly, the Jehovah's Witnesses could bring a case before the Strasbourg Court.

00:01:59.879 --> 00:02:06.879
That is, of course, time-consuming and slow, but the draconian and extreme nature of

00:02:06.879 --> 00:02:10.719
the sanctions being taken against the Jehovah's Research.

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:15.479
And also, their permanent consequences in terms of the confiscation of property ought

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:21.120
to prompt the Strasbourg Court into trying to maintain the status quo before hearing.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.639
Clearly, it will be a very testing time and they will be subject to a higher degree of

00:02:26.639 --> 00:02:30.080
persecution than they've had to suffer already.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:35.840
I would say, from my experience of meeting and working with Jehovah's Witnesses, is that

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:45.360
I find it surprising in the extreme to regard them as extremists or as a social danger.

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:51.319
Some may find them irritating, but, of course, being irritated with people is no reason

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:53.680
for shutting them down or removing their rights.
