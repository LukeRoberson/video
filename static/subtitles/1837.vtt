00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:16.859
I pray for my brothers and sisters every day, because I know Jehovah is the hero of prayer.

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:30.899
Ever since our baptism, we as a family were fully engaged in Christian activities.

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:38.740
It was a busy yet fulfilling life.

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:45.840
I really loved preaching.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.840
I enjoyed conducting Bible studies and talking to others about the truth.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.840
At one point, I was the only elder in the congregation.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:03.840
I tried to make shepherding calls on everyone, but I just did not have the time.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:11.310
So I developed a habit of praying for them many times during the day.

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.310
I would mention them individually by name.

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:22.310
I wanted Jehovah to protect his precious sheep from Satan's attacks.

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:31.819
Some time later, my wife felt seriously ill.

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:40.200
After being hospitalized for a while, I decided to take care of her at home.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.200
I needed to step down from pioneering.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.200
Kuniko served Jehovah faithfully until her death.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.700
After a while, I became sick as well.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:12.729
One morning, I felt especially bad and couldn't move.

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:19.729
Fortunately, I managed to survive somehow, but now I'm confined to a wheelchair.

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:26.729
I can no longer walk in the ministry as I used to or handle congregation responsibilities.

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:32.979
I need help to change clothes and take a shower.

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:39.979
I get really depressed when I think of the times when I was able to move around freely.

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:52.180
But Jehovah never forgets the love we've shown.

00:02:52.180 --> 00:03:00.180
He is pleased to see us doing our very best in whatever circumstances we are in.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:07.180
I am limited in what I can do, but I can still pray.

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:14.180
In my prayers, I mention a name of those in my congregation and my personal friends.

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:20.180
I make a list of their names, so it's not to forget anyone.

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:28.180
Through JW.org, I read about the brothers in Russia being arrested and the situation in an Eritrea.

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:33.180
So I make sure to include them in my prayers.

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:40.180
The governing body and its helpers, those in full-time service, also need Jehovah's support.

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:47.550
Jehovah is without a doubt the hero of prayer.

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:54.550
When I was the only elder in the congregation, or when my wife was sick and bad,

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:57.550
he listened to my prayers.

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:05.960
So I am confident prayers that I offer will help my fellow friends.

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:14.870
Now, I do what I can in service, such as witnessing to caregivers.

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:19.870
When I meet those who might have not seen for a long time and tell them,

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:21.870
I've been praying for you.

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.870
They often tell me how it has really helped them.

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.870
Some even shed tears out of gratitude.

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.629
I feel happy too.

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:41.629
Although I'm getting physically weaker every day, my prayers are becoming more and more meaningful.

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:50.629
I want to cherish this precious gift of prayer that Jehovah has given us as long as I live.
