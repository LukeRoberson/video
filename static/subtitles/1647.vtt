WEBVTT

00:00:11.439 --> 00:00:17.480
The personal committee of the governing body is privileged to care for the needs of numerous

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:25.719
willing servants of Jehovah God, who say, as did Isaiah, here I am, send me.

00:00:25.719 --> 00:00:32.000
These include the thousands of brothers and sisters working hard, full time, at Bethel's

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.000
around the world, supporting the commission to give a witness to all the nations.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.560
Today, Bethel work assignments often extend beyond the walls of the main Bethel facilities.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:51.799
The vital work that is accomplished in such Bethel facilities is greatly appreciated.

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:58.799
However, in this presentation, we'd like to focus on the wonderful work our remote volunteers

00:00:58.799 --> 00:01:02.520
are doing to further kingdom interests.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:08.400
To whom does the term remote volunteer apply?

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.280
Remote volunteers are exemplary, baptized publishers and regular pioneers who regularly

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:20.760
are assigned to collaborate with the branch office or world headquarters remotely, right

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.159
from their homes.

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.319
Many of them also have secular jobs.

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:33.599
More than 3,000 of these volunteers work each week in behalf of 42 departments, such

00:01:33.599 --> 00:01:37.959
as art, computer and purchasing.

00:01:37.959 --> 00:01:45.400
And although there are only 90 branches, there are hundreds of additional remote locations

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.519
where Bethel work is taking place.

00:01:48.519 --> 00:01:54.719
This arrangement for remote workers makes wise use of donated funds and it allows various

00:01:54.719 --> 00:02:00.159
departments to adapt quickly to changing needs.

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:06.879
In this report from Korea, you'll see an example of how remote volunteers are contributing

00:02:06.879 --> 00:02:10.240
to the kingdom work.

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.280
To get the feeling that I'm working with Bethel, even though I'm working at home, I wake

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:21.960
up extra early and consider the daily text and read a chapter of the Bible with my wife.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:28.319
I dress as if I'm going out in field service and start the day off with words of prayer

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:34.879
to maintain the feeling that this work is also a form of sacred service.

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:39.520
I do Bethel work on Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:44.360
When I finish my Bethel work for the day or on days I don't work for Bethel, I spend time

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:51.240
in the ministry, do personal study or take care of personal matters.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:56.639
The branch office has equipped me with the same system and tools that are used in Bethel.

00:02:56.639 --> 00:03:01.560
So even though I live quite far from the branch, it feels like I'm right there in Bethel.

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.120
I can also communicate with the brothers in the branch whenever I need to.

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:13.759
So I can work with the same sense of commitment and joy as if I'm working in Bethel.

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:18.439
With the recent adjustments in the arrangement for Kingdom All Construction, the branch office

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:23.120
is now responsible for the procurement and supply of all the construction materials

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.360
for projects across the country.

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:34.669
This seemed like a daunting task, since we only have a few in our department.

00:03:34.669 --> 00:03:41.310
Headquarters encouraged us to use remote workers to care for this need.

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:46.830
So we were very happy to have brothers experienced and handling business matters and construction

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:52.310
materials to help with the work.

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:58.310
I do remote volunteer work for the purchasing department in Bethel, and my job mostly involves

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:03.030
purchasing building materials for LDC construction sites.

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:11.069
I use three hours a day from 9 a.m. to noon to do my Bethel work and from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m.

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:16.850
I do my secular work to support my family and myself.

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:22.209
Although we work alone from a remote location, the brothers are well aware of the difficulties

00:04:22.209 --> 00:04:23.889
we face.

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:29.449
And so they provide us with various guidelines and even provide encouraging spiritual talks

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:35.129
so that all of us, whether we work inside or outside of Bethel, can maintain good spiritual

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:36.930
health.

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.329
We are really thankful for these arrangements because they remind us that Jehovah has

00:04:41.329 --> 00:04:46.129
a keen interest in us and appreciates the work being done by remote volunteers.

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:53.970
I serve as a remote volunteer for the LDC office.

00:04:53.970 --> 00:05:00.990
I help design the signs for arching them halls.

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:08.629
The LDC office sends photographs of construction sites and blueprints through a dedicated network.

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:14.389
I carefully consider what type of sign to install, its placement, its size, and then I send

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:20.000
the final design back to the LDC office.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.519
In the 10 years of running a design business after I got baptized, my wife and I never

00:05:25.519 --> 00:05:31.439
imagined that we could use our talents for Jehovah's organization so we left everything

00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:35.720
behind and focused fully on pioneering.

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:41.620
We were surprised to learn that our talents can be used for Jehovah.

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:45.740
We thank Jehovah for using us and doing his work.

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:50.500
It's such a great joy and privilege for us.

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:57.060
My work assignment involves translating documents for the LDC and service departments.

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:03.180
Some of the documents that I translate include letters, forms, outlines, guidelines, and

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:06.259
contents for our website.

00:06:06.259 --> 00:06:11.019
After my Bethel work is finished for the day, I try to share in the provision for evening

00:06:11.019 --> 00:06:12.819
witnessing.

00:06:12.819 --> 00:06:18.779
Going out and field service helps me to realize the value and importance of the Bethel work

00:06:18.779 --> 00:06:21.019
that I'm involved in.

00:06:21.019 --> 00:06:26.579
And this gives me the strength to carry on in this type of service.

00:06:26.579 --> 00:06:31.300
I work as a remote volunteer for the audio video department in the Korea branch.

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:36.060
I assist with the translation work for JW Broadcasting.

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:43.620
As a husband and a father, taking care of the needs of my family is my first priority.

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:47.180
But I don't feel like I'm doing this alone.

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:55.139
As long as we don't sacrifice the needs of our family, I feel like my wife and my

00:06:55.139 --> 00:07:02.540
daughter are all taking part in the spiritual work together.

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:07.459
Since Jehovah has allowed me to take part in this work, I'm confident that he will make

00:07:07.459 --> 00:07:12.300
things work even when I come across situations that are beyond my control.

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:19.220
And every day, I experience how Jehovah is supporting me.

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:24.180
Participating in this work has helped me to realize that there are many avenues of service

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:27.459
open to sisters.

00:07:27.459 --> 00:07:32.779
Serving as a remote volunteer is a great way to give our best to Jehovah while living

00:07:32.779 --> 00:07:34.620
in this time of the end.

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:43.089
I would encourage anyone to make themselves available for this avenue of service.

00:07:43.089 --> 00:07:47.569
We warmly thank all those who are volunteering in this way.
