WEBVTT

00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:09.089
It is my great pleasure to warmly welcome all of you and to say, Shalom.

00:00:09.089 --> 00:00:11.650
Why is saying that appropriate?

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:17.350
Well Shalom is the Hebrew word for peace, and it occurs over two hundred times in the

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:18.670
Bible.

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:25.969
When its use is a greeting, just as I used it, it means, may you have peace.

00:00:25.969 --> 00:00:31.570
So what could be a more appropriate way to greet all of you at the start of this pursue

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:36.450
peace, convention of Jehovah's Witnesses?

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.810
We are very pleased that you're with us, and we assure you you will not be disappointed.

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:48.210
To the contrary, you'll be glad you were able to devote three days to learning what the

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:56.490
Bible says about how to gain and maintain peace in all areas of your life.

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:01.789
But now, let's begin by talking about the person who has drawn us all together for this

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:10.090
convention, Jehovah, and how we delight in talking about our marvelous heavenly Father.

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.530
Philippians 4.9 caused Jehovah the God of peace.

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:21.489
Nice true, he possesses many qualities, love, justice, wisdom, power, but he also possesses

00:01:21.489 --> 00:01:23.890
the quality of peace.

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:29.530
If you think about it, he is at peace with himself, at peace with angels, at peace with

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.569
faithful humans, yes, he is the God of peace.

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:38.890
But here's a question, does Jehovah keep this peace to himself?

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.689
Well, let's get the answer, Romans chapter 15.

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:50.290
And please, let's read verse number 33.

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:57.569
May the God who gives peace be with all of you, amen.

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:00.849
So he generously gives this peace as we'll be discussing.

00:02:00.849 --> 00:02:06.730
In fact, he gives every good gift, every perfect present according to James 117.

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:10.770
And one of his finest presents is the gift of peace.

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.449
And here's another question, what kind of peace does Jehovah give?

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:21.770
Well, many equate peace with freedom from conflict and strife in one's life.

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.370
But the peace Jehovah gives is a lot more than that.

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:35.250
The peace that only Jehovah can supply brings in feelings of safety, security, well-being.

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:40.129
This Jehovah-given peace is described very nicely in Philippians chapter 4.

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:41.530
Let's go there.

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:48.650
Philippians 4, beginning in verse 6, do not be anxious over anything, but in everything

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:56.889
by prayer and supplication, along with thanksgiving, that your petitions be made known to God.

00:02:56.889 --> 00:03:04.969
And the peace of God that surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts and your mental powers

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:07.370
by means of Christ Jesus.

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:12.930
So notice, Jehovah is saying, do not be anxious over anything.

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.370
Would Jehovah tell us to do something it was impossible for us to do?

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:18.530
No.

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:24.889
But obviously, he's talking about not being overly anxious.

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:27.729
Controlled anxiety can actually be beneficial.

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:30.969
It can move us to show concern for others.

00:03:30.969 --> 00:03:36.490
It can motivate us to work enthusiastically to accomplish an assignment.

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:39.210
But now what about excessive uncontrolled anxiety?

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:42.009
Well, I can lead to physical problems.

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:46.849
Depression can be crippling, debilitating, infebling.

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:54.370
But now, how can we avoid being overly anxious over anything?

00:03:54.370 --> 00:04:00.409
The answer is given in the next words of Philippians 4, 6, and 7, after telling us not

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:03.650
to be anxious, Jehovah gives the antidote.

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:10.889
He basically tells us to pray, supplicate, petition him, and we will get that peace of God.

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:19.250
But now what does the Scripture mean when it says that this peace of God surpasses all

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:20.569
understanding?

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:26.730
Well, we could say that it's so amazing, so powerful, that we limited humans cannot

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:28.810
fully understand it.

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.529
It defies logic from a human standpoint.

00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:36.850
Our hearts and minds may be filled with so much worry, fear, anxiety.

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:42.769
We see no way out, but we beg Jehovah for the peace that he can supply.

00:04:42.769 --> 00:04:44.370
And then what happens?

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:52.610
Our minds and hearts amazingly are filled with calmness, security, tranquility.

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:58.889
Lorraine, a young girl whose mother was dying of cancer, said this.

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:03.689
I was in the room when my mother took her last breath.

00:05:03.689 --> 00:05:08.970
I asked Jehovah to give me the strength to endure and to get through this.

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:15.129
Immediately I felt the peace of God.

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:21.850
But now what is meant by the expression, the peace of God will guard your hearts and

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:22.850
your mental powers.

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:29.689
Well, the Greek word translated guard is a military term that evokes a mental picture

00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:33.730
of soldiers maintaining a day and night watch.

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:40.370
In the same way, see this peace of God can act like a 24 hour guard over our hearts and

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:45.769
mental powers, keeping them calm, secure, and tranquil.

00:05:46.689 --> 00:05:53.930
Now here's a question, what is the key ingredient to are being able to receive this miraculous

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:55.769
peace of God?

00:05:55.769 --> 00:06:01.490
The answer, having a close friendship with Jehovah.

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:07.490
The Apostle Paul experienced firsthand many times that having inner peace depends not

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:13.649
on circumstances, but rather on a close personal relationship with Jehovah.

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:19.930
For example, on one occasion, because Paul and Silas boldly preached, they had their

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:22.649
garments ripped off of them.

00:06:22.649 --> 00:06:25.649
They were beaten many blows with rods.

00:06:25.649 --> 00:06:28.129
They were thrown into the inner prison.

00:06:28.129 --> 00:06:31.250
Their feet were fastened in stocks.

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:37.769
But in the middle of the night, what if Paul and Silas began to do, they began to pray,

00:06:37.769 --> 00:06:40.610
placing sawns of praise to Jehovah.

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:45.930
In amazement, all the other prisoners were listening to them.

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:52.449
So obviously, their very, very unfavorable circumstances had not robbed them of their

00:06:52.449 --> 00:06:54.529
precious peace of God.

00:06:54.529 --> 00:06:58.610
So let's learn this valuable lesson from Paul and Silas.

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:05.009
Having the peace of God is not dependent on our circumstances, but it is dependent on

00:07:05.009 --> 00:07:10.449
having a close personal relationship with Jehovah.

00:07:10.449 --> 00:07:15.649
Thus far, we've discussed how Jehovah is a God of peace, who gives peace, and we've

00:07:15.649 --> 00:07:18.370
talked about what kind of peace he gives.

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:24.290
But now we ask, to whom does Jehovah give peace?

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:31.050
The simple answer is, Jehovah gives peace to those who draw close to him and want to

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:33.490
follow his guidance.

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:40.490
So receiving peace from Jehovah starts with living a clean life following Jehovah's

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:42.769
righteous moral standards.

00:07:42.769 --> 00:07:50.089
Many people in Satan's world, as you know, believe that God will accept them as they are,

00:07:50.089 --> 00:07:53.730
that God in effect will lower his standard to accommodate them.

00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:56.089
Can you imagine such pride?

00:07:56.089 --> 00:08:03.449
That would be like a pot telling its maker, the potter, how the pot must be used.

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:07.410
And the potter must accept this, whether he likes it or not.

00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:10.009
Well, we know it doesn't work that way, does it?

00:08:10.009 --> 00:08:13.089
We have to come up to Jehovah's righteous standards.

00:08:13.089 --> 00:08:18.649
Now he'll help us, but we do the changing, certainly not, Jehovah.

00:08:18.649 --> 00:08:26.970
Interestingly, James chapter 3, verse 17 says that the wisdom from above is first of

00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:31.730
all pure, then peaceable.

00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:38.129
So if we want peace from Jehovah that will result in peaceful lives, we must be pure according

00:08:38.129 --> 00:08:40.610
to Jehovah's moral standards.

00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:49.929
Isaiah 48, 22 reads, there is no peace, says Jehovah, for the wicked, or put another way,

00:08:49.929 --> 00:08:55.529
those who wickedly set their own moral standards will receive no peace from Jehovah and will

00:08:55.529 --> 00:08:58.049
not have peaceful lives.

00:08:58.049 --> 00:09:02.610
But we work hard to live by Jehovah's standards.

00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:09.330
Now it's true, Jehovah does his part to help us, but he does expect us to do our part.

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:14.769
We could say that his blessing on our effort is somewhat like multiplication.

00:09:14.769 --> 00:09:16.409
What do we mean?

00:09:16.409 --> 00:09:21.370
Well, if we put forth no effort, there's nothing for Jehovah to multiply.

00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:24.009
See, what is 10 times zero?

00:09:24.009 --> 00:09:25.009
Zero.

00:09:25.009 --> 00:09:30.970
A hundred times zero, a thousand times zero, a million times zero, we still have zero.

00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:36.370
So if we don't do anything, Jehovah has nothing to multiply.

00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:44.009
Galatian 5.22 tells us that peace is an aspect of the fruitage of the Holy Spirit.

00:09:44.009 --> 00:09:48.730
So the Holy Spirit will help us cultivate and demonstrate peace.

00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:57.409
In fact, John 1426 describes the Holy Spirit as a helper, but that expression helper doesn't

00:09:57.409 --> 00:10:04.090
indicate it will miraculously do the job for us with no effort on our part.

00:10:04.090 --> 00:10:05.769
Illustrate this if we can.

00:10:05.769 --> 00:10:11.769
Imagine that you're working very hard to paint the outside of your house, and a good friend

00:10:11.769 --> 00:10:15.289
comes to help you, now you're painting together.

00:10:15.289 --> 00:10:21.250
But then you decide, I'll just go back in the house, and I'll just take it easy.

00:10:21.250 --> 00:10:24.490
Well how long will your friend keep painting?

00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:30.929
If he continued painting, he's no longer a helper, he's doing the job for you.

00:10:30.929 --> 00:10:38.409
Luke 1113 tells us that Jehovah will give Holy Spirit to those asking him for it.

00:10:38.409 --> 00:10:44.809
So if we ask for Holy Spirit and then do our very best to work in harmony with that helper,

00:10:44.809 --> 00:10:52.610
we will enjoy peace with God, and we will enjoy and promote harmony, unity, and good relations

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:54.090
with others.

00:10:54.090 --> 00:11:00.850
And what a pleasure it is to associate with those who display peace, this important aspect

00:11:00.850 --> 00:11:04.250
of the Spirit's fruitage.

00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:11.450
When a sleeping baby is suddenly awakened in the middle of the night by a loud noise,

00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:13.610
it becomes frightened, doesn't it?

00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:15.929
And he cries out for help.

00:11:15.929 --> 00:11:24.889
But when a parent cuddles him and soothes him with reassuring words, he calms down immediately.

00:11:24.889 --> 00:11:33.370
Well David, at Psalm 55, 16 through 18, said that when he was troubled, he called out to

00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:40.009
God, and that Jehovah heard his voice and gave him peace.

00:11:40.009 --> 00:11:46.409
Right David, when we're in anguish, we can supplicate our Heavenly Father and He will

00:11:46.409 --> 00:11:50.450
soothe and restore our peace.

00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:56.450
In fact, our loving Father is eager to do this for us.

00:11:56.450 --> 00:12:05.090
Open up to Jeremiah 29, and notice he's eager to replace our anxiety with the peace from

00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:07.090
him.

00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:16.009
Jeremiah 29, 11, for I will know the thoughts that I am thinking toward you, declares Jehovah,

00:12:16.009 --> 00:12:21.929
thoughts of peace, and not of calamity to give you a future and a hope.

00:12:21.929 --> 00:12:27.450
And you will call me and come and pray to me.

00:12:27.450 --> 00:12:31.690
And I will listen to you.

00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:37.049
In that beautiful, our God is ready, willing, and able to replace our anguish.

00:12:37.049 --> 00:12:43.049
Our own anxiety with this amazing peace that only He can give.

00:12:43.049 --> 00:12:47.370
Well we've now discussed how Jehovah is the God of peace.

00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:53.490
We've discussed who He gives the peace to, to those who draw close to Him, and earnestly

00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:55.730
seek peace from Him.

00:12:55.730 --> 00:13:03.370
But now let's examine how each of us can promote peace with others.

00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:09.090
In the following video, Brother Kenneth Cook of the Governing Body will explain how

00:13:09.090 --> 00:13:16.950
this convention program will help us to pursue peace.

00:13:16.950 --> 00:13:22.669
On behalf of the Governing Body, I can say that we really appreciate your attending this

00:13:22.669 --> 00:13:25.950
pursue peace convention.

00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:32.509
Speaking of peace, we love the serene setting here at our World Headquarters on Blue Lake

00:13:32.509 --> 00:13:34.549
in New York State.

00:13:34.549 --> 00:13:39.230
The times, the water is as smooth as a mirror.

00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:43.269
We occasionally see eagles and hawks fly by.

00:13:43.269 --> 00:13:49.990
And in the fall of the year, when the leaves change colors, the forest can look spectacular.

00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:55.309
More important than this tranquil setting though, is the abundant peace that Jehovah has

00:13:55.309 --> 00:13:58.350
given to his organization.

00:13:58.350 --> 00:14:05.149
We can say this because of the peace and harmony that unite us, no matter what our nationality,

00:14:05.149 --> 00:14:09.909
language, race, tribe, or social background is.

00:14:09.909 --> 00:14:17.230
This is truly spectacular, especially when we consider all the turmoil in the world

00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:23.149
and how divided people are politically, socially, and religiously.

00:14:23.149 --> 00:14:28.309
However, we cannot take our beautiful peace for granted.

00:14:28.309 --> 00:14:31.429
It's not maintained automatically.

00:14:31.429 --> 00:14:37.190
Each of us personally must pursue peace in order to have God's approval.

00:14:37.190 --> 00:14:42.110
Jehovah certainly wants his worshipers to enjoy lasting peace.

00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:44.389
That was true in ancient times.

00:14:44.389 --> 00:14:51.629
God told Moses to have the priests in Israel bless the people with very reassuring words.

00:14:51.629 --> 00:14:58.950
Notice these words that we find at Numbers chapter 6, verses 24 through 26.

00:14:58.950 --> 00:15:02.950
And hear what the priests were to say to the people.

00:15:02.950 --> 00:15:06.789
May Jehovah bless you and safeguard you.

00:15:06.789 --> 00:15:11.990
May Jehovah make his face shine upon you and may he favor you.

00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:17.309
May Jehovah lift up his face toward you and grant you peace.

00:15:17.309 --> 00:15:23.669
The next verse states, and they must place my name upon the people of Israel that I may

00:15:23.669 --> 00:15:26.149
bless them.

00:15:26.149 --> 00:15:32.070
Jehovah has placed his name on us too, and he is richly blessing us.

00:15:32.070 --> 00:15:36.629
Let's consider what this convention program is going to cover so that we'll know how

00:15:36.629 --> 00:15:41.110
we can continue to enjoy God's blessing of peace.

00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:46.629
First, we'll consider how to be at peace with God.

00:15:46.629 --> 00:15:52.669
More greatest peace comes from having a personal relationship with Jehovah.

00:15:52.669 --> 00:15:59.350
Making him our best friend benefits us and leads to peace in every other aspect of our

00:15:59.350 --> 00:16:00.909
life.

00:16:00.909 --> 00:16:05.389
How can we reach out for a close relationship with God?

00:16:05.389 --> 00:16:09.070
We need more than a superficial knowledge of him.

00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:15.429
We need to get to know Jehovah as a person and admire his qualities and ways.

00:16:15.429 --> 00:16:21.110
Then we can love what he loves and hate what he hates.

00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:27.389
During this program, listen for details about Jehovah that will draw you ever closer to

00:16:27.389 --> 00:16:28.710
him.

00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:33.870
Second, we'll consider how to be at peace with others.

00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:38.070
Our home should be havens for peace for our families.

00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:41.149
This means more than the absence of arguing.

00:16:41.149 --> 00:16:46.470
It involves putting the interests of our family members ahead of our own.

00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:52.350
As we'll learn from this program, that includes showing love and respect to one another, working

00:16:52.350 --> 00:16:59.669
as a team, improving family communication, and worshipping Jehovah together.

00:16:59.669 --> 00:17:07.670
Third, we'll consider how to be at peace despite trials and troublesome world conditions.

00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:14.549
During this convention, we're going to tour the world to see how, despite opposition,

00:17:14.549 --> 00:17:22.349
illness, economic problems, and natural disasters, our brothers really care for one another.

00:17:22.349 --> 00:17:29.829
How they receive help from Jehovah's organization and how they continue their spiritual activity.

00:17:29.829 --> 00:17:35.349
No matter what may threaten our lives or livelihood, we can be confident that Jehovah

00:17:35.349 --> 00:17:41.269
can help us get through it and retain our peace of mind and heart.

00:17:41.269 --> 00:17:46.589
Fourth, we'll consider how to enjoy peace eternally.

00:17:46.589 --> 00:17:53.869
Once God's kingdom has lifted mankind to perfection, we'll no longer have to pursue peace.

00:17:53.869 --> 00:18:01.190
As Psalm 72 verse 7 promises, the righteous will flourish and peace will abound until

00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:03.950
the moon is no more.

00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:08.269
In other words, there will be peace forever.

00:18:08.269 --> 00:18:14.309
This program will help us to anticipate future blessings from Jehovah.

00:18:14.309 --> 00:18:20.630
Can you see why pursue peace was well chosen as the theme for this year's convention?

00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:26.470
To pursue something means to chase it in order to capture it.

00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:32.309
Because of the influence of Satan, his wicked world, and our own imperfections, peace is

00:18:32.309 --> 00:18:35.269
constantly trying to elude us.

00:18:35.269 --> 00:18:39.869
Therefore we have to chase after it to capture it in our lives.

00:18:39.869 --> 00:18:44.390
This convention program will help us do that.

00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:50.069
May the God of peace be with all of you now and forever.

00:18:50.069 --> 00:18:57.589
That's the heartfelt wish of all of us on the governing body because we love you dearly.

00:18:57.589 --> 00:19:04.799
Please enjoy the entire convention program.

00:19:04.799 --> 00:19:10.440
We warmly thank Brother Cook for highlighting some of the ways this convention program will

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:14.200
help us to pursue peace.

00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:21.480
But now let's briefly preview the convention program that is coming our way that has been

00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:27.279
provided by the God of peace, and you may want to follow along by using your copy of

00:19:27.279 --> 00:19:29.880
the convention program.

00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:36.559
To note, day one has the theme, Jehovah will bless his people with peace.

00:19:36.559 --> 00:19:42.039
The first symposium will illustrate how love for God, love for neighbor, and love

00:19:42.039 --> 00:19:47.559
for God's word, lead to genuine peace.

00:19:47.559 --> 00:19:53.160
This year's dramatic Bible reading is based on the life of Jacob.

00:19:53.160 --> 00:20:01.039
And as you will see Jacob gives us an excellent example as to how we can pursue the things

00:20:01.039 --> 00:20:03.759
making for peace.

00:20:03.759 --> 00:20:10.960
Thereafter, we will have the talk, the result of true righteousness will be peace.

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:16.000
And we'll see in that talk how we can resist temptation.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:21.680
Just as a lion devours prey and assimilates it into his body, same tries to get us to

00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:28.599
come to temptations so he can devour us and assimilate us into his world.

00:20:28.599 --> 00:20:33.000
But during that talk, we'll learn how to reject his temptations.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:40.039
Then, in the second half of day one, we'll enjoy our second convention symposium, take

00:20:40.039 --> 00:20:44.440
delight in God's promises of peace.

00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:51.079
We will be greatly heartened by Jehovah's promises of peace found in the Book of Isaiah.

00:20:51.079 --> 00:20:57.160
For example, one of the talks has a theme, the wolf and the lamb will feed together.

00:20:57.160 --> 00:21:02.559
Today, we can't even imagine feeding a wolf and a lamb together.

00:21:02.559 --> 00:21:09.720
If we tried such, it would likely result in lamb shops for the wolf.

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:16.559
But Jehovah's promise in Isaiah assures us that peace will exist between humans and animals

00:21:16.559 --> 00:21:21.279
and between animals and other animals.

00:21:21.279 --> 00:21:30.720
The third convention symposium has the thought-provoking theme, follow the roadmap to family peace.

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:37.640
We'll learn how, despite challenges, marriage mates, parents and children can successfully

00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:41.559
follow that roadmap to family peace.

00:21:41.559 --> 00:21:47.319
One will enjoy the talk, loyally support the Prince of Peace.

00:21:47.319 --> 00:21:52.279
That talk will remind us of the importance of maintaining our neutrality by not taking

00:21:52.279 --> 00:21:55.640
sides on political issues.

00:21:55.640 --> 00:22:04.440
To conclude day one, we'll have the intriguing talk, do not be misled by imitation peace.

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:10.960
It will contrast the world's so-called peace, with a genuine peace that Jesus will give

00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:12.640
his followers.

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:22.079
But then day two, notice the theme, be found spotless and unblemished and in peace.

00:22:22.079 --> 00:22:29.079
The second day starts with a symposium designed to invigorate us for our ministry so that

00:22:29.079 --> 00:22:35.440
we can be ready to share the good news of peace.

00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:43.119
That will be followed by the talk, young people, choose a path that leads to peace, and

00:22:43.119 --> 00:22:48.279
that talk will encourage our dear young ones to pursue the full-time ministry.

00:22:48.279 --> 00:22:54.079
And we want to say to you, dear young ones, if you do this, you will enjoy a happy life

00:22:54.079 --> 00:22:56.400
and you will have no regrets.

00:22:56.400 --> 00:23:02.799
Next, we will see a video that shows how our brothers around the world are continuing

00:23:02.799 --> 00:23:09.279
their spiritual activity and are enjoying peace despite difficult trials.

00:23:09.279 --> 00:23:15.440
Then, a highlight of the day will be the baptism of new disciples of Jesus.

00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:22.240
In the baptism talk, the baptism candidates will be encouraged to go on walking in the

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:24.000
way of peace.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:25.559
And why?

00:23:25.559 --> 00:23:29.839
Because this is truly the best way of life.

00:23:29.839 --> 00:23:37.640
Two more symposiums will use video dramatizations to contrast traits of peace records with

00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:41.359
the qualities of peace makers.

00:23:41.359 --> 00:23:47.079
And what a stark contrast between the two, you'll see in these symposiums.

00:23:47.079 --> 00:23:51.880
It's kind of like the contrast between bitter and sweet.

00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:58.680
Part one of this year's Bible drama will remind us of ancient examples of God's people

00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:03.960
who pursued peace and will definitely be able to relate to their examples and relate

00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:07.759
it to our current situation in life.

00:24:07.759 --> 00:24:15.039
The day will conclude with showing us how to safeguard our unining bond of peace.

00:24:15.039 --> 00:24:20.960
We'll see how we can do so by putting the application of Bible principles always ahead

00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:25.359
of following local culture and traditions.

00:24:25.359 --> 00:24:34.200
Now day three, the theme, may the God who gives hope fill you with all joy and peace.

00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:41.759
The opening symposium will examine seven examples of ones who sowed peace and reaped

00:24:41.759 --> 00:24:43.000
peace.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:51.160
We will examine Joseph and his brothers, the Gibbonites, Gideon, Abigail, Mothibbasheth,

00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:55.880
Paul and Barnabas, and modern examples.

00:24:55.880 --> 00:25:02.200
We truly hope that many accept our invitation to hear the enlightening public Bible discourse

00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:07.960
entitled Friendship with God How Possible.

00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:12.799
Now if we think about it, we're not born as friends of God because we're born as sinful

00:25:12.799 --> 00:25:14.359
offspring of Adam.

00:25:14.359 --> 00:25:19.160
Actually, we think about it, we're born as enemies of God.

00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:24.440
Friends you'll hear people say of a little baby, look at that little angel.

00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:30.559
But more accurate would be to say, look at that little enemy of God.

00:25:30.559 --> 00:25:35.720
Now of course we love that little baby, and it's not hopeless because our loving creator

00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:41.359
has made reconciliation with him within the reach of everyone.

00:25:41.359 --> 00:25:47.480
We can become a good friend of God, and that close relationship with Jehovah will become

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:50.440
our most valuable possession.

00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:56.960
But then after we enjoy part two of the Bible drama, the concluding talk of this convention

00:25:56.960 --> 00:26:05.599
will fill our hearts with a joyful prospect that universal peace is sure to come.

00:26:05.599 --> 00:26:09.640
It's guaranteed by the God who cannot lie.

00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:15.279
Finally, we'll join in singing a beautiful new original song, and we'll close with a

00:26:15.279 --> 00:26:20.759
prayer appraise to Jehovah, the source of peace.

00:26:20.759 --> 00:26:28.279
So dear brothers and sisters, there's a brief synopsis of our wonderful three-day convention

00:26:28.279 --> 00:26:33.720
provided by the God of Peace that is coming our way.

00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:39.960
And throughout, the program will be enhanced with dozens of videos, and we'll see our

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:47.640
brothers either in real-life settings or dramatizations that we'll definitely be able to relate

00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:48.640
to.

00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:55.200
In fact, the following video is a little small sampling of the videos you will see during

00:26:55.200 --> 00:27:06.980
this convention.

00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:10.500
I wanted to go up to the girls and smash their phones.

00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:15.660
You're just a coward to get trash.

00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:19.740
Why was feeling back then was just sadness?

00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:21.819
Never really peace.

00:27:21.819 --> 00:27:25.339
Hello everyone, Haley from Genoa Design here.

00:27:25.339 --> 00:27:29.819
Is there just a little bit of envy in there?

00:27:29.819 --> 00:27:34.940
In June of 2018, a huge group of armed men came to us.

00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:39.700
They represented the ideals of my childhood.

00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:42.059
Do you have any idea what this is going to cost us?

00:27:42.059 --> 00:27:43.059
I didn't have a choice.

00:27:43.059 --> 00:27:45.059
You went behind my back.

00:27:45.059 --> 00:27:47.099
Where's your mask?

00:27:47.099 --> 00:27:50.099
Do you know how many people have actually gotten sick?

00:27:50.099 --> 00:27:52.299
Zero.

00:27:52.299 --> 00:27:56.700
That's what always happens when you're just about to lose all your strength.

00:27:56.700 --> 00:27:59.339
Jehovah does that something for you.

00:27:59.339 --> 00:28:08.670
I'm so grateful that we made peace before the world turned upside down.

00:28:08.670 --> 00:28:12.190
But here's an important question for all of us.

00:28:12.190 --> 00:28:19.150
Will we prepare our heart to receive God's peace during this convention?

00:28:19.150 --> 00:28:27.670
Ezra chapter 7 verse 10 tells us that Ezra prepared his heart to consult the law of Jehovah

00:28:27.670 --> 00:28:31.549
and to practice it and to teach it to the Israelites.

00:28:31.549 --> 00:28:33.230
Now what was it resolved?

00:28:33.230 --> 00:28:40.750
Verse 11 tells us he became an expert in the study of the commandments of Jehovah.

00:28:40.750 --> 00:28:47.150
Well in imitation of Ezra, how can we prepare our heart for what we're going to take

00:28:47.150 --> 00:28:49.309
in at this convention?

00:28:49.309 --> 00:28:55.309
Well for one thing, very important, by prayer and meditation, we can make sure that our

00:28:55.309 --> 00:29:01.750
heart is ready, receptive to receive Jehovah's instruction.

00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:07.950
And we can also make sure that in our heart, we are determined to apply what Jehovah teaches

00:29:07.950 --> 00:29:08.950
us.

00:29:08.950 --> 00:29:16.029
But then another thing we can do, we can pay close attention to the music video presentations

00:29:16.029 --> 00:29:20.150
that will be shown before every session of the convention begins.

00:29:20.150 --> 00:29:27.230
Now these presentations have been carefully crafted to help prepare our heart for each

00:29:27.230 --> 00:29:28.750
session.

00:29:28.750 --> 00:29:36.990
Such time, effort and expense has been expended in preparing these beautiful presentations.

00:29:36.990 --> 00:29:44.470
So please listen carefully as the sounds and scenes prepare your heart to accept the spiritual

00:29:44.470 --> 00:29:47.549
instruction that will follow.

00:29:47.549 --> 00:29:57.029
Yes, may each of us be determined to listen attentively to what Jehovah is teaching us.

00:29:57.029 --> 00:30:05.549
May we be determined to imitate the Psalmist who humbly stated at Psalm 85 verse 8, I will

00:30:05.549 --> 00:30:13.109
listen to what the true God Jehovah says, for He will speak peace to His people.

00:30:13.109 --> 00:30:19.710
If we do, we will learn how to pursue peace with all people to the praise of Jehovah, the

00:30:19.710 --> 00:30:23.509
God of peace, who blesses His people with peace.

00:30:23.589 --> 00:30:31.430
Yes, we will be successful in pursuing peace until we no longer have to pursue it.

00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:32.910
Now what do we mean?

00:30:32.910 --> 00:30:34.269
Well, think about it.

00:30:34.269 --> 00:30:37.029
Does Jehovah have to pursue peace?

00:30:37.029 --> 00:30:39.869
Does he have to chase it in an effort to try to catch it?

00:30:39.869 --> 00:30:41.069
No.

00:30:41.069 --> 00:30:44.710
Jehovah merely displays peace.

00:30:44.710 --> 00:30:51.349
Well, in the New World, what a wonderful time it will be when we no longer have to pursue

00:30:51.349 --> 00:30:57.190
peace, but like Jehovah, we can merely display peace.

00:30:57.190 --> 00:31:03.869
But right now, let's be determined to continue to pursue peace and may this wonderful

00:31:03.869 --> 00:31:08.589
convention that is coming our way, help us to do so.
