00:00:03.759 --> 00:00:29.199
And I thought what we could do is just go right to the Bible account that deals with

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:30.199
that.

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:37.399
Your kingdom will be yours again after you come to know that the heavens are ruling.

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:41.359
So that is the dream that King Nebuchadnezzar had.

00:00:41.359 --> 00:00:46.399
But as we discussed last week, that dream is actually a prophecy.

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:51.159
Now it's important to remember that similar to other prophecies in the book of Daniel,

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:56.960
this prophecy points forward to God's kingdom with Jesus Christ as ruler.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.399
So what I thought we could do today is look at some specific points of this prophecy

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.719
and to see the relationship between God's kingdom and the year 1914.

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:12.719
And this article has a fantastic chart here that provides some great visuals that we can

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:13.719
go over.

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:16.959
And I also made a few notes for myself additionally.

00:01:16.959 --> 00:01:20.439
So if you don't mind, maybe we could just spend the next few minutes and consider this.

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:21.439
Sure.

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:22.439
Sure.

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:23.439
That sounds good.

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:24.439
I always enjoy talking about the Bible.

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:25.439
Great.

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.280
Well, let's get started.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.120
What do you see in that first box there?

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.959
An enormous tree.

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:34.439
Is this the tree that we just read about in the prophecy?

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:35.959
That's exactly it.

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:40.000
And in the second box, you'll notice that there's a picture of an axe.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.159
And that indicates that the tree was chopped down.

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:44.920
But what happens next?

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.920
It says, let's seven times pass.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:48.920
Yeah.

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.680
A period of time went by, and then eventually the tree grew again.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.840
So those are the basic pieces to the puzzle.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.359
We've got this enormous tree.

00:01:58.359 --> 00:02:05.719
It gets chopped down seven times pass, and then eventually the tree grows again.

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:07.480
Well that's the prophecy.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.360
But what we want to know is what does it actually mean?

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.879
Well, the chart helps us out there as well.

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:15.360
Notice underneath it mentions rulership.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.400
So the tree signifies rulership.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.860
Now logically, if that's the case, if it's spoken of as being chopped down, then that

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.719
rulership would be interrupted, someone's rulership.

00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:31.479
Then there'd be an interval of time that would pass, and then eventually that rulership

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:33.159
would be restored again.

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:35.159
So does that explanation seem reasonable?

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:36.159
I think so.

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:37.159
Good.

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:39.879
Well, then let's consider the fulfillment of the prophecy.

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:44.400
Now as we can see from our chart, there's both an initial fulfillment and a larger one.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.639
Let's just spend a few minutes considering the first one.

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:50.000
So who is pictured by that tree?

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Excellent.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.039
And the tree would be an apt depiction of Nebuchadnezzar because like that tree, he was

00:02:57.039 --> 00:03:01.800
very prominent and very powerful as the King of Babylon.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:07.879
But also like that tree, he was chopped down, so to speak, when he lost his sanity and

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:10.000
could no longer continue ruling.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.080
Now according to the chart, how long did that last?

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.159
It says seven literal years.

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:17.159
That's it.

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:23.159
So after those seven years, Nebuchadnezzar regained his sanity and began ruling again.

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:25.439
So let's just recap kind of what we've considered so far.

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:28.360
Who was pictured in his first fulfillment by the tree?

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.360
Nebuchadnezzar.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.360
Good.

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.400
And how was he chopped down?

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.240
He loses his sanity.

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.400
That's it.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.719
And for how long?

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:37.719
Seven years.

00:03:37.719 --> 00:03:38.719
True.

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:44.240
And after that seven years, he regained his sanity and then began ruling again.

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.719
Now does that make sense?

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:50.439
But what does this have to do with God's kingdom in 1914?

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:52.520
That's a great question.

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:57.560
Well we know there's a larger fulfillment of this prophecy because Jesus himself spoke

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:58.560
about it.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.960
I see later in the chart here it refers to Luke 21 and verse 24.

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:04.719
Notice what Jesus said.

00:04:04.719 --> 00:04:11.400
Jerusalem will be trampled on until the appointed times of the nations are fulfilled.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.520
What did he mean by that?

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:17.800
Well notice here in the first box down at the bottom, it says, Israelite kings who

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.560
represent God's rulership.

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.240
Well those kings are also represented by that tree, so that line of kings is Israeli

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.439
the larger fulfillment of that.

00:04:27.439 --> 00:04:33.600
Now you might remember the Bible referred to these kings as sitting on Jehovah's throne.

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:39.360
That's because God appointed them to rule over his chosen people at the time, the Israelites.

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:45.879
Unfortunately, as years went by, most of those kings became disobedient to God.

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:49.639
And in turn, their subjects did the same.

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:56.600
So eventually Jehovah saw fit to destroy Jerusalem in 607 BCE.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:03.079
After that point, no more earthly kings figuratively sat on Jehovah's throne.

00:05:03.079 --> 00:05:07.720
So it says though God's rulership was interrupted.

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.959
Now according to the chart, how long did that interruption last?

00:05:10.959 --> 00:05:15.240
The chart says 2,520 years.

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.839
Exactly.

00:05:16.839 --> 00:05:24.240
So if we calculate 2,520 years from the time Jerusalem was destroyed in 607, that brings

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.639
us all the way to 1914.

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:32.920
And that is when Jesus began ruling in heaven as king of God's kingdom.

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:36.920
I know it's a lot to take in, but does that explanation make sense?

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:43.420
I think so, but I still have some questions.

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:47.139
Where do you get this 2,520 years?

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:50.740
How do you know that that's the period of time?

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:54.819
And how do you know for sure that this prophecy is about God's kingdom?

00:05:54.819 --> 00:06:01.540
Is it possible that the kingship would be restored right here on earth in Jerusalem?

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:04.220
Those are all excellent questions.

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:07.060
And we've taken in a lot of information here.

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:10.500
But the best thing for us to do to really get the answer is to look at it in light of

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:13.180
the complete Bible.

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:17.100
Because that will assure us that this is definitely a heavenly kingdom.

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:22.860
And we can find scriptural texts that point to this number 2,520.

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:28.100
So what if the next time I come, we consider those specific scriptures and also the remainder

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:29.100
of this article.

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:33.019
And I think you're going to find it answers the rest of your questions.

00:06:33.019 --> 00:06:34.019
Sure.

00:06:34.019 --> 00:06:35.699
That sounds good.

00:06:35.699 --> 00:06:38.620
Is there some way that I could download this electronically?

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:41.060
I'd like to take a look at this chart some more.

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:42.060
Absolutely.

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:44.379
Let me show you how to get on our website.

00:06:44.379 --> 00:06:45.379
The site is jw.org.

00:06:45.379 --> 00:06:50.860
So when you go to the site, you just go up to publications.

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:52.860
And then from there, you choose magazines.
