00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.599
Water.

00:00:07.599 --> 00:00:13.699
From space, it is our planet's most striking feature.

00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:18.059
We find water everywhere that we find life.

00:00:18.059 --> 00:00:20.460
And this is no coincidence.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:29.309
For each drop of water has extraordinary properties that are essential for all living things.

00:00:29.309 --> 00:00:36.789
For example, North American redwood trees can grow to be over 100 meters tall.

00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:44.429
Water, carrying nutrients must travel from the roots all the way up to the highest leaf.

00:00:44.429 --> 00:00:50.479
How does water overcome gravity to reach these great heights?

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:59.409
To help answer this, notice what happens when a narrow glass tube is placed in a dish of water.

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:03.810
Water begins to rise inside the tube.

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:08.290
What causes this to happen?

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:14.930
As we have considered, water is a polar molecule, that is, one side has a negative charge,

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.250
and the other side has a positive charge.

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:24.450
As a result, water molecules form what are called hydrogen bonds with other polar molecules,

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.769
including the glass molecules just above them in the sides of the tube.

00:01:29.769 --> 00:01:35.129
At the same time, the bonds between the water molecules pull the surface-taught

00:01:35.129 --> 00:01:40.489
and draw up the molecules below, like links in a chain.

00:01:40.489 --> 00:01:48.689
These same forces, adhesion and cohesion are at work in trees.

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:55.569
Water rises inside the trunk of a tree via tiny capillaries or tubes.

00:01:55.569 --> 00:02:01.049
Meanwhile, as water evaporates from the leaves, it creates an upward pull

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:06.170
that is transmitted through the chain of water molecules below.

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:15.650
Together, these forces lift the water, carrying vital nutrients to each limb, branch, twig, and leaf.

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.530
All around us, this amazing process is quietly at work in plants,

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.129
from the smallest wildflower to the tallest tree,

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:31.310
which in turn provide food and oxygen for humans and animals.

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.909
But perhaps our most direct and personal connection to water

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:38.750
comes from its role within our own bodies.

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:44.990
From the blood that circulates through our veins to the fluid around and inside our cells,

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:49.270
water is the perfect medium for life.

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:54.909
As a powerful solvent, water breaks down salts, minerals, and other nutrients,

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:59.750
carrying these in solution to nourish our cells.

00:02:59.789 --> 00:03:06.030
As a chemical reactant, it is essential in the digestion of our food.

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.270
Even proteins, the fundamental building blocks of our cells,

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.830
have a special relationship with water.

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:20.469
To function correctly, a protein must be folded into a specific three-dimensional shape.

00:03:20.469 --> 00:03:29.729
And this crucial folding process is guided by subtle interactions between the protein and water.

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:36.969
Yes, in every way, the properties of water are precisely balanced to support life.

00:03:36.969 --> 00:03:45.419
Without water, our cells would be as dry and lifeless as a harbor in the middle of a desert.

00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:56.349
Instead, water energizes our cells, keeping us active, healthy, and alive.

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:00.110
What an extraordinary creation water is.

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:07.949
And what a unique role it has been given in sustaining all living things on our beautiful planet Earth.

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:15.110
On every level, from the tiniest molecules to the vast ocean spanning the globe,

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:22.199
water is masterfully interwoven with the fabric of life.

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:28.399
It is a powerful and daily testimony to our wise creator, Jehovah God,

00:04:28.399 --> 00:04:33.839
the one who made the heaven and the earth and sea and fountains of waters.
