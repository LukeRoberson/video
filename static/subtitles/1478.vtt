00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:13.859
Jehovah appreciates the effort made by His worshipers each day to show their love for

00:00:13.859 --> 00:00:16.100
His Son, Jesus.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:23.039
In His statement recorded at John 14 verse 23, Jesus Himself made this point clear,

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:30.719
If anyone loves me, He will observe my word, and my Father will love Him.

00:00:30.719 --> 00:00:36.079
It is truly beautiful to observe how you have embraced the word.

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:41.960
You are tirelessly devoting time and physical power to advance the work of preaching about

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.759
the kingdom.

00:00:43.759 --> 00:00:50.280
As loyal friends of Jesus and Jehovah, you have also shown steadfast support for the kingdom

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.159
through your monetary donations.

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:59.399
Within your means you have given generously.

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:05.560
Jehovah highly esteems these powerful gifts, which are expressions of love for what His

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.599
Son is doing.

00:01:08.599 --> 00:01:14.000
The brothers of the governing body have asked me to express their deep appreciation for the

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.959
love you have shown.

00:01:15.959 --> 00:01:22.560
We want to reassure you, your donations have a powerful impact.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:31.359
Since June 2020, the article series How Your Donations Are Used Has Chronicle This Power.

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:38.599
Each one tells a story highlighting how donations are being used to further the kingdom work.

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:44.840
Have you ever wondered what happened after the article was published?

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:57.870
In the following video, notice how your donations continue to have a powerful effect.

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:01.269
After an Indigenous community opposed the freedom of worship of our brothers and

00:02:01.269 --> 00:02:07.629
Ecuador, the Constitutional Court heard a court case regarding this fundamental issue.

00:02:07.629 --> 00:02:14.539
Should the Indigenous communities respect international human rights?

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:19.419
The court accepted our reasoning and decided yes.

00:02:19.419 --> 00:02:24.379
With the loving support through the donations from our brotherhood and Jehovah's blessing

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:31.379
on this issue, the court ruling is available and has already been used for legal argument

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:37.849
in other similar cases and in other parts of the world.

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:42.849
This court decision was a great victory for our brothers and sisters around the world.

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:48.409
But if we think about the community with the opposition arose, we can see encouraging

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:49.770
progress.

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:54.889
The community was surprised by the size of the organisation behind the small group of

00:02:54.889 --> 00:02:56.889
local publishers.

00:02:56.889 --> 00:03:02.090
The more the community got to know Jehovah's Witnesses, the more they respected and valued

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:03.090
us.

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:09.210
Now, instead of experiencing opposition, our brothers enjoy a peaceful relationship with

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:10.930
the community.

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:24.919
For example, the congregation of 53 publishers enjoyed a memorial attendance of 106 in 2024.

00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:29.560
Due to tremendous growth, Africa has bought the same need for new Kingdom halls and

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.240
major innovations as all other continents combined.

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.680
The cost of construction in Africa continues to be a challenge.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:43.719
In Tanzania, for example, we are about 25 million Tanzanians live on less than $2 a day,

00:03:43.719 --> 00:03:48.120
building a new Kingdom Hall can cost over $50,000.

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:53.000
Thanks to the donations of local publishers, along with those from the global brotherhood,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:00.240
publishers are able to enjoy new and renovated Kingdom halls in all parts of the world.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:06.280
Here in Mafinga, we benefited from a renovation on our Kingdom Hall.

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.919
It is a place of worship that is respectable.

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:13.039
Now we even get the videos easily.

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:21.079
Truly, it has given a very good witness in the community and attracted many to the meetings.

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:31.560
We thank Jehovah for this provision of support through our worldwide brotherhood.

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.800
Translating the Bible takes many years.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.319
Therefore, it requires thousands of hours of work by the translators.

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:44.160
Through the donations made by the brothers and sisters, we use a translation tool developed

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.720
by the organization.

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:51.439
This tool helps us to translate the Bible in a clear and understandable way.

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:56.120
In certain remote areas, access to the Bible is a big challenge.

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:02.279
In Tombay, for example, a congregation had only one Bible to share among all the publishers,

00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:06.040
and that translation of the Bible was difficult to understand.

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:11.399
After the release of the Kiluba New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures in 2018,

00:05:11.399 --> 00:05:16.920
we had an increase of more than 20% of publishers in just one year.

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:23.839
It is clear that the word of God in Kiluba has had a big impact on our brothers and sisters.

00:05:23.839 --> 00:05:30.439
We are confident that seeing the impact of your donations strengthens your faith.

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:33.600
But what if you have little material?

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.600
Perhaps you wish you could give more.

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:43.240
If that is how you feel, remember what the Bible says about our gifts to Jehovah.

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:48.600
It is especially acceptable according to what a person has.

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:52.279
Not according to what a person does not have.

00:05:52.279 --> 00:05:58.079
Your generosity with what you have is what shows how much you love the Christ.

00:05:58.079 --> 00:06:06.160
And rest assured, your donations are meaningful, appreciated, and they have power.

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:12.000
It is our prayer that you will continue to see the power that your love of the Christ has

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.800
on your brothers.

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:18.519
Thank you for all you have done and will continue to do.
