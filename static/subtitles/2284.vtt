00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:05.660
I was born to be strong.

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:07.660
I was raised that way.

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.660
My father was a bodybuilder and a fighter.

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.660
That's why he named me Hercules.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.660
I was raised in a seaside town in Rio de Janeiro,

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.660
where my father had a gym.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.660
From early on, our life was not easy.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.660
My father was very aggressive.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.659
I felt frustrated and angry about the things that I saw happening at home.

00:00:33.659 --> 00:00:42.119
The only way I found to let out these feelings was with my fists, my fighting.

00:00:42.119 --> 00:00:45.119
I had a lot of anger inside of me.

00:00:45.119 --> 00:00:47.119
I felt worthless.

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:54.100
I loved music, especially heavy metal.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.100
So I joined many different bands.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.100
The fans' admiration felt really good

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:09.079
when the show ended, however, I would feel empty.

00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:11.079
I kept asking myself,

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:13.079
is this all there is to life?

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:15.079
Is there a purpose in life?

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:17.079
I believed in a creator,

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:20.079
but I didn't trust any religions.

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:22.079
One day, I was speaking to a guitarist.

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:24.079
He was studying what Jehovah's Witnesses

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:27.079
and a subject came up about the soul.

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:31.079
He began to show me in the Bible what the soul really is.

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:34.079
What he showed me really impressed me

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.079
because it was irrefutable.

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.079
I began to ask him lots of questions.

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:44.459
In time, I myself started studying the Bible.

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:48.459
A little while later, an opportunity arose for us to sign a contract,

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:51.459
something that would affect my whole life.

00:01:51.459 --> 00:02:00.370
But I wouldn't be able to serve Jehovah while in an environment that was moral, dirty.

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:08.020
It was then that I decided to leave the band.

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.020
But I needed to make big changes.

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.020
Leaving the band was just one of them.

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.939
I still had a fight against immorality,

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:21.939
my strong personality,

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:25.469
my aggressive nature,

00:02:25.469 --> 00:02:27.469
the Colossians 310 assured me

00:02:27.469 --> 00:02:33.520
that it was possible to put on a new personality.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.520
With the help and support of my study conductor,

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.520
I qualified to be baptized in 1989

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:44.860
and do not regret the decision I chose.

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:50.860
Then in 1992, I met a zealous and dedicated pioneer who became my wife.

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:57.020
His love for Jehovah has helped him become a calmer,

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:01.020
more loving and more caring person.

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:05.020
I joined Adilza and began serving as a pioneer.

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.020
In 1998, we were assigned to circuit work.

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:14.020
And from then on, we began to visit congregations around the country.

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:18.020
One of the things we enjoyed this work is being among the brothers.

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:26.460
I still love music,

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:29.460
but I discover that I wouldn't have any purpose in life

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:33.460
if I weren't serving Jehovah wholeheartedly.

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:37.460
I discover that true strength isn't physical,

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:42.460
and that power doesn't come from fame or from being successful.

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:46.460
True strength and power comes from serving Jehovah.
