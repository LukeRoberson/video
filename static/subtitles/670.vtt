00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:08.509
Just after the Supreme Court decision banning our activity in Russia that that was given in April

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:16.989
The Finland branch committee wrote to the teaching committee and right away requested permission to arrange a convention for about

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.589
4,000 of our dear brothers from Russia

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:24.670
Well now quite coincidentally or perhaps not

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:30.629
Back in January, I was feeling a little bit tired and I have some good friends in Finland

00:00:30.629 --> 00:00:36.630
And so we arranged to go to a convention together in the month of June. That was all approved back in January

00:00:36.909 --> 00:00:44.350
Well, by coincidence, can you imagine it turned out to be the same weekend that this Russian convention was being planned for Finland

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:52.390
And so the teaching committee asked me if I'd be willing to serve this Russian convention instead of the finished one and of course I was delighted

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:59.329
Beds were needed for all of these 4,000 brothers. Well, can you imagine in just a short time

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:08.230
4,373 beds were offered in many cases the brothers had no place to house visitors

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:12.750
But what did they do? They called the branch and said we'll pay for a hotel room

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.150
We don't care who it's for put whoever you want there, but we want to pay the cost

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.670
So everyone was able to be accommodated

00:01:21.269 --> 00:01:27.590
When the brothers arrived in Finland some had come from as far away as Vladivostok traveling some

00:01:27.989 --> 00:01:31.230
6,000 miles if you can imagine to attend this convention

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:37.310
The brothers were at the train stations. They were at the airport to welcome all the guests

00:01:37.989 --> 00:01:41.790
Now when the first brothers and sisters arrived at the convention venue

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:49.430
They asked well, where is the Russian section since they believed that this was a finished convention with Russian sessions

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:53.349
Well, when they were told that this convention had been organized just for them

00:01:53.549 --> 00:02:01.989
They began immediately to cry. Can you imagine the joy that the brothers had when they were able to sing out with full voice

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.629
The singing was so so moving

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.909
Well, the peak attendance of the convention was 5,137 and

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:13.629
33 were baptized

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:22.270
Well during the convention the Finland branch committee arranged for the delegates to be able to tour Bethel and to allow as many as possible to come through

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:24.629
Bethel was

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:33.990
kept open until 8 p.m. on Thursday, Friday and Monday and also on Sunday evening from 6 p.m. until 8 p.m

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:42.349
And can you imagine during the day the kitchen arranged to feed all of the brothers and sisters who came through in the dining room

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:48.349
The love that was witnessed was amazing and although it's perhaps not their culture

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:52.949
Do you know the finished brothers hugged every single brother and sister that came through

00:02:53.389 --> 00:03:00.909
Well, when it was a time to say goodbye the bond of love that had been established between the finish and the Russian brothers

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:07.909
Was just wonderful to say and although we all thought we would be crying to see them go back to Russia and the challenges there

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:12.030
You know, we just couldn't cry because the brothers were too happy about the convention

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:18.830
And there was no one saying poor me. They all went back with just a joyful spirit and it moved us

00:03:19.669 --> 00:03:25.509
Well, just a few weeks later we had to return to Russia again for the appeal hearing at the Supreme Court

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:32.909
Most of you are aware of course that an international delegation of 18 brothers were present in the courtroom for the hearing

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.389
But perhaps this last part of the story you haven't heard

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:41.669
World headquarters legal had explained to us that if the decision was negative

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:44.949
We would have to leave the country of Russia that same night

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:51.110
Well, of course we didn't know if the hearing would be just that one day or if it would stretch on for other days

00:03:51.110 --> 00:04:00.150
So our only choice was to take all of our things with us to the court and if the decision came we would have to make immediate plans to leave Russia

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:03.389
Well, sure enough at 7 p.m

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:11.069
The negative decision was announced we had to leave Russia, but the problem was none of us had tickets

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:21.509
So what did we do? Well, we told the brothers just get in the vehicles and head for the airport while we were communicating with the World Headquarters travel desk

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:29.189
Well, thanks to the wonderful and very hard work of those wonderful brothers and sisters that work with the travel desk

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:36.949
About halfway to the airport. I began to receive the tickets for all 18 brothers via email

00:04:37.829 --> 00:04:44.629
By Jehovah's undeserved kindness all 18 brothers were able to get out on the same flight

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:51.829
Can you imagine the last flight out of Moscow and here we are just before 1 a.m

00:04:53.029 --> 00:05:02.310
When we arrived in Riga Latvia we truly felt as though we had been picked up by Jehovah and safely carried out of Russia

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:06.790
Well all of the brothers and sisters that I met along the way on these

00:05:07.269 --> 00:05:15.110
These trips wanted to send their warm Christian love and greetings to all of you and let them know that just as you're praying for them

00:05:15.589 --> 00:05:17.589
They're also praying for you
