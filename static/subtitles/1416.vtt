00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:04.660
You're about to meet the Williams family from Britain.

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:08.660
Their circumstances allow them to generously give of their time and resources

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.660
by serving where the need is greater.

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.660
But was it easy? No.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.660
But their desire to serve Jehovah helped them overcome their fears.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:27.969
The things that I'm scared about are also the things that I'm excited about.

00:00:27.969 --> 00:00:30.969
I think it's fear of the unknown.

00:00:30.969 --> 00:00:33.969
It's leaving one life behind

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:42.659
and you're going into this totally brand new life.

00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:47.509
It's going to be mixed emotions leaving the house

00:00:47.509 --> 00:00:52.509
because I know there's so much ahead of me

00:00:52.509 --> 00:00:55.509
that it's going to be wonderful.

00:00:55.509 --> 00:01:00.079
We focus on the future and the things ahead.

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:04.079
My name is Mark Williams. I'm a father and a husband.

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:06.079
The circuit overseer came to the congregation

00:01:06.079 --> 00:01:12.079
and he showed the video good news to every nation tribe and Tongue.

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:16.079
As a family man, when I saw that, when Alison saw that,

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:20.079
we thought, well, maybe that's something that we could do.

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:23.079
So we were just kind of nudging each other and thinking,

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:26.079
well, look at that. That's fantastic.

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:29.079
My name is Alison Williams and I live in Buckingham.

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:32.079
We wanted to take our children into an environment

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:40.079
where they could blossom and thrive spiritually.

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.079
So they're all kind of contributed to us thinking,

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:48.079
well, why don't we take a trip?

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:51.079
Why don't we go and visit Ecuador at least to see?

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:59.079
We went from month to visit Ecuador while the land was one of the best months we had.

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:03.870
We did get many of our questions answered.

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:10.870
I'd never put a lot of thought into where I could go and serve in another country,

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:15.870
because I was probably holding on to my life here,

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:21.870
life in the congregation, life in our little home

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.870
and the business as well.

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.870
Well, we eventually did come to the point

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.870
where we made the decision that we would go.

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:36.870
In eight weeks' time, we are leaving England to go to Ecuador to serve where they need us greater.

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.870
We're also proud of each other.

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.870
I'm so proud of the children in March,

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.870
because they've got rid of so many things that have been close to their hearts

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.870
and yet they've had such a great spirit about it

00:02:48.870 --> 00:03:12.599
that it's made me feel really proud of them.

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:27.560
We're going to serve in a city in Ecuador called Quenca, which is in the Andes.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.560
So it's cooler, which is easier for us Brits.

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.560
It's a combination of trying to bring together two needs,

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.560
the needs that's in the field.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.289
Also, we have needs as a family to make sure that

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:44.289
particularly our children feel comfortable.

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:48.289
The meetings have been wonderful because the brothers have given us such a warm welcome.

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:50.289
They just have showered us with love

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:53.289
and they've been so patient even though we don't know the language.

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:58.289
One brother said, you'll speak a bit like Tarzan and Jane,

00:03:58.289 --> 00:04:05.090
and that's exactly how I feel.

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.090
The other day I was involved in some street work,

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:11.090
left an invitation with an old man, shook my hand,

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.090
sport lots of Spanish that I didn't understand.

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.090
But when I left him and walked down the road,

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.089
I looked back and there he is, he's got the invitation open, he's reading it.

00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:21.089
I think they're just happy to hear his try.

00:04:21.089 --> 00:04:25.089
Wherever you are in a cafe or a restaurant or the taxi or a bus,

00:04:25.089 --> 00:04:29.089
everybody is ready to hear about Jehovah.

00:04:29.089 --> 00:04:34.779
I really enjoy being with the Lopez family.

00:04:34.779 --> 00:04:37.779
I've worked with Angela in the Ministry a few times.

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:42.779
Actually, we didn't know each other,

00:04:42.779 --> 00:04:45.779
but in a matter of about five minutes,

00:04:45.779 --> 00:04:48.779
the ice was broken,

00:04:48.779 --> 00:04:51.779
and it's like we've known each other for years.

00:04:52.779 --> 00:04:56.779
It's wonderful to have this worldwide family,

00:04:56.779 --> 00:05:00.779
knowing wherever you go, you'll have friends,

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:07.779
and it's been really special to have Paola waiting for me on the other side.

00:05:08.779 --> 00:05:11.779
And that can encourage us to do the same,

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:13.779
because really it's not impossible,

00:05:13.779 --> 00:05:16.779
but an entire family moving to another continent

00:05:16.779 --> 00:05:19.779
is something really encouraging.

00:05:19.779 --> 00:05:22.779
I really enjoy playing football and basketball,

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:24.779
because I've been able to make new friends

00:05:24.779 --> 00:05:26.779
and get to know the brothers and sisters better.

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:35.129
I see how happy Alison is,

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:37.129
and how content she is,

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:39.129
and I look at the children,

00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:41.129
the association they've got,

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:44.129
how they're included in so many different activities in it.

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:46.129
As a father, when I see my children,

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:48.129
and as a husband, when I see my wife so happy,

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:54.069
that makes me happy, so yeah, it's all been worth it.

00:05:54.069 --> 00:05:57.069
I just want to say thank you to Mum and Dad for taking us here,

00:05:57.069 --> 00:05:59.069
because we're already loving it,

00:05:59.069 --> 00:06:01.069
we've got new friends,

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:03.069
we feel part of a new family,

00:06:03.069 --> 00:06:06.069
and just to be able to experience a ministry

00:06:06.069 --> 00:06:09.069
and service Jehovah in a totally different land.

00:06:09.069 --> 00:06:20.889
So it's not about the things that we've left behind,

00:06:20.889 --> 00:06:23.889
it's the fact that we're doing this together as a family,

00:06:23.889 --> 00:06:26.889
and that's what's really important.

00:06:26.889 --> 00:06:47.800
What a beautiful family.

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:50.800
Would your circumstances allow you to serve

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:52.800
where the need is greater?

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.800
If so, you will benefit

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.800
from a very practical advice found

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:58.800
in the August 2011

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:01.800
Our Kingdom Ministry article and title.

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:04.800
Can you step over into Macedonia?
