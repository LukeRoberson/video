00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:06.919
Many people today believe in God

00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:09.919
and are interested in spirituality.

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:12.919
Yet instead of turning to organized religion,

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:16.920
they choose to practice spirituality on their own.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:17.920
Why?

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:23.230
Some have been disillusioned by religiously-based violence

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:29.239
and the hypocrisy of religious leaders.

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:38.159
Have dismissed religion as a relevant,

00:00:38.159 --> 00:00:46.509
must you belong to an organized religion to worship God?

00:00:47.509 --> 00:00:49.509
What's God's view?

00:00:50.509 --> 00:00:54.509
The Bible tells us how faithful people in the past worshiped God,

00:00:54.509 --> 00:00:57.509
people such as Abraham.

00:00:57.509 --> 00:01:00.509
Abraham had a personal relationship with his creator.

00:01:00.509 --> 00:01:04.510
He even came to be called God's friend.

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:09.510
He lived by God's standards and taught his household to do the same.

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.510
Like many other faithful people in the Bible,

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.510
Abraham worshipped as part of a community with family and servants.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:21.510
Later, God required the ancient Israelites

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.510
and first-century Christians to worship together as a group.

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:29.510
Those gatherings included reading and explaining scriptures,

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:35.209
singing, and praying together.

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:40.209
God's worshipers were organized into what were called congregations.

00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:46.209
The Bible mentions congregations found throughout first-century Asia Minor and Europe.

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:50.209
In fact, many statements in the Bible would make little sense

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:54.209
if God did not require us to worship Him as part of a congregation.

00:01:54.209 --> 00:02:03.739
For example, first Corinthians one time says that his worshipers should not be divided.

00:02:03.739 --> 00:02:10.300
Rather, they should be united and in agreement on spiritual matters.

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:18.509
How could someone apply this direction if his or her worship was independent and attached from others?

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:24.509
The biblical evidence clearly shows that God wants you to serve Him and offer Him praise

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:30.330
as a part of His congregation of people.

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:39.169
He wants you to meet and worship alongside people who truly care about one another,

00:02:39.169 --> 00:02:45.120
who, like you, are interested in learning more about Him.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.120
But you may wonder, if there's an organized religion God approves of,

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.120
how can I find it today?

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:58.969
