00:00:03.569 --> 00:00:09.570
The Bible identifies a second source of help that Jehovah has given us so that we can

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.449
experience the joy of making disciples.

00:00:13.449 --> 00:00:17.730
That gift is described at 1 Peter, chapter 5, and verse 9.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.530
Please read that with me.

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:24.899
1 Peter, chapter 5, and verse 9.

00:00:24.899 --> 00:00:30.780
But take your stand against him, firm in the faith, knowing that the same kind of sufferings

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:38.939
are being experienced by the entire association of your brothers in the world.

00:00:38.939 --> 00:00:41.420
What hope has Jehovah given us?

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.780
It's our worldwide association of brothers and sisters.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.659
Just as their example can help us to endure, our brothers can also help us meet the challenges

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:52.979
in the ministry.

00:00:52.979 --> 00:01:00.179
Yes, Jehovah has given us a large spiritual family, and that shows that he wants us to experience

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:03.979
the joy of working together.

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:10.219
Now we might be thinking, that's encouraging, but is it realistic to think that I can experience

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:13.340
the joy of making a disciple?

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.019
Perhaps you've had Bible studies, but none of them have yet progressed to the point of

00:01:17.019 --> 00:01:19.260
dedication and baptism.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.540
So you might wonder, am I really up to that challenge?

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:29.299
Or maybe you're a parent who's newer in the truth, and you're thinking to yourself,

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:36.500
how can I reach my child's heart and help him or her learn to love Jehovah as I do?

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:42.060
Or maybe you're dealing with poor health, or the effects of old age, and you wonder,

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.459
can I have an effective ministry?

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:50.939
Brothers and sisters, we want you to take heart.

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:56.299
Jehovah has provided help, and help may be near than you think.

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:01.299
To highlight the help that Jehovah gives to all of us for a few moments, let's consider

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:04.579
the Apostle Paul's experience.

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:08.580
When we think of the Apostle Paul, what comes to mind?

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:15.139
Perhaps a very hard-working, energetic brother who traveled extensively as a missionary.

00:02:15.139 --> 00:02:20.419
And can there be any doubt that Paul's ministry was a complete success?

00:02:20.419 --> 00:02:26.460
What was Paul's success, the result of his efforts alone?

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:27.979
No.

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:31.780
Paul needed and humbly accepted help from others.

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:38.580
For example, you may recall reading in Acts 16 and 17, how the man Silas traveled with

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:39.979
Paul.

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:46.539
On that trip in the city of Philippi, Paul and Silas shared the joy of helping an entire

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:50.259
family become baptized to disciples.

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:54.539
Now there's something very interesting in the Bible's record of that account.

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:59.300
Every time Paul is mentioned, Silas is mentioned as well.

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:05.379
In fact, the expression, Paul and Silas occurs six times in quick succession.

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:07.939
Well, what do we learn from that?

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:10.699
Clearly, Paul had help in his ministry.

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:13.419
He did not go it alone.

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:16.180
Now young ones, a question for you.

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:22.460
Can you think of another close friend of Paul who often traveled with him?

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:25.460
You got it right, Timothy.

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:30.740
For about fourteen years, the two of them worked together in Jehovah's service.

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:36.819
Now did Paul, the more experienced man, really view Timothy as a helper as someone who could

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:38.379
assist him?

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:40.419
Yes, he did.

00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:46.099
As Paul neared the end of his life, for example, he wrote to Timothy, his younger friend,

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:51.259
and said, Do your utmost to come to me shortly.

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:56.659
Paul was not too proud to ask for help.

00:03:56.659 --> 00:04:03.020
In Acts chapter 18, the Bible tells us about a married couple, Aquila and his wife Priscilla

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:06.060
or Priska, who supported Paul.

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:11.539
In the city of Corinth, they welcomed Paul not only into their home, but also into the

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:14.340
business of making tents.

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:21.279
Now can you imagine how much joy these three must have had as they worked together, not

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:28.060
only in the secular trade of making tents, but also in advancing the kingdom good news?

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.779
Now when Paul left Corinth, do you know what happened with Aquila and Priscilla?

00:04:32.779 --> 00:04:35.860
They followed him to Ephesus.

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:42.699
Their Aquila and Priscilla used their home as a meeting place for the local congregation.

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:44.819
Their helpful services continued.

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:50.860
In Acts chapter 18, at verse 24, we learned that this couple became acquainted with Apollas.

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:57.139
A Christian from Egypt, who, according to the scriptural account, was an eloquent man

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:00.899
and well-versed in the Scriptures.

00:05:00.899 --> 00:05:07.779
Even so, Apollas needed some help because he had some gaps in his understanding.

00:05:07.779 --> 00:05:11.819
So what did help Priscilla and Aquila do?

00:05:11.819 --> 00:05:18.860
Acts chapter 18 verse 26 tells us, they took Apollas into their company and explained

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:22.180
the way of God more accurately to him.

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:24.459
Now think of that for a moment.

00:05:24.459 --> 00:05:30.060
This humble couple, tent makers, were not intimidated by Apollas.

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:36.259
To them he was a brother, a part of the family, and out of brotherly love they took the initiative

00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:40.100
to give him the help that he needed.

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:45.779
While in thinking about Paul and how he viewed those that assisted him, how do you think

00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:48.660
he felt about this beautiful couple?

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:53.259
Please open your Bible with me to Paul's own words that Jehovah preserved in Romans

00:05:53.259 --> 00:05:57.180
chapter 16 verses 3 and 4.

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:01.459
Let's Romans chapter 16 verses 3 and 4.

00:06:01.459 --> 00:06:04.379
Let's read it together.

00:06:04.379 --> 00:06:11.500
Give my greetings to Priska or Priscilla and Aquila, my fellow workers in Christ Jesus

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:17.420
who have risked their own next for me and to whom not only I but also all the congregations

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:21.339
of the nations give thanks.

00:06:21.339 --> 00:06:25.220
Deep appreciation is what Paul felt for this loyal couple.

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:29.899
He viewed them as his fellow workers.

00:06:29.899 --> 00:06:35.500
Now what does all of that we've discussed tell us about the Apostle Paul?

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:43.139
Clearly the success he enjoyed in his ministry was not the result of his efforts alone.

00:06:43.139 --> 00:06:49.420
Jehovah gave Paul the help he needed to have an effective ministry and that help came

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:53.699
in the form of many brothers and sisters.

00:06:53.699 --> 00:06:59.180
Dear brothers and sisters, Jehovah has given you and given me the same help.

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:06.180
In the following dramatization, please notice how Anita benefits from the help of another

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:07.180
sister.

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:24.259
I've tried everything to get day to a meeting.

00:07:24.259 --> 00:07:28.259
It's every Thursday and Sunday and I think I think you'd really enjoy it.

00:07:28.259 --> 00:07:31.259
I can't promise anything.

00:07:31.259 --> 00:07:43.959
It would be nice if you could come.

00:07:43.959 --> 00:07:54.920
Have you tried bringing other people on the study?

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:58.899
Well maybe not everything.

00:07:58.899 --> 00:08:33.649
What are you doing tomorrow after me?

00:08:33.649 --> 00:08:37.649
Long time since I hear them.

00:08:37.649 --> 00:08:38.649
You know that band?

00:08:38.649 --> 00:08:39.649
Know them.

00:08:39.649 --> 00:08:44.649
I used to see them all the time before I'm a witness.

00:08:44.649 --> 00:08:45.649
No way.

00:08:45.649 --> 00:08:46.649
You like that kind of music.

00:08:46.649 --> 00:09:02.889
You don't believe me?

00:09:02.889 --> 00:09:09.169
Have you gay?

00:09:09.169 --> 00:09:13.919
I was young.

00:09:13.919 --> 00:09:14.919
You were in a band.

00:09:14.919 --> 00:09:30.970
We have that vinyl.

00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:35.970
So I'll be gone next week but I'll have someone else take care of the study.

00:09:35.970 --> 00:10:12.840
Did you notice how Anita responded to the suggestion that was given her?

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:17.840
Applying that council brought good results.

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:23.840
Like Anita, we may need specific help to accomplish our ministry fully.

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:28.840
For example, when it comes to making return visits and conducting Bible studies,

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:34.840
could some brothers and sisters in your congregation help you to improve your skills?

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:42.840
Likely, all of us would benefit by reaching out to such publishers who have gained experience

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:45.840
and skill in those aspects of the ministry.

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:51.840
What if you're a parent who wants to instill love for Jehovah in the heart of your child?

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:56.840
How about asking some other parents or grandparents for advice?

00:10:56.840 --> 00:11:02.840
If they've had success raising their children to love Jehovah and become baptized disciples,

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:07.840
they will certainly be happy to share their experience with you.

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:12.840
And what if we have age, limitations, or health concerns?

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:17.840
We may need practical assistance that accommodates our needs.

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:23.840
For example, at many Bethel homes, elderly and infirm brothers and sisters are still having a regular

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:25.840
and productive share in the ministry.

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:27.840
Do you know how?

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:35.840
Elders at Bethel arranged for younger publishers to join the elderly ones in letter writing and phone witnessing.

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:40.840
One sister by the name of Nancy, who was nearly 90 years old at the time, said this.

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:44.840
I don't view letter writing as just stuffing envelopes.

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:46.840
This is field service.

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:49.840
People need to know the truth.

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:51.840
How encouraging.

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:59.840
Did you know that in less than a year, one group of precious older ones devoted over 1,000 hours to the ministry,

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:07.840
wrote over 6,000 letters, made over 2,000 phone calls, and placed over 6,000 pieces of literature?

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:14.840
What good was accomplished by working together and what joy they experienced?

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:22.840
Of course, we have to admit that it takes humility to acknowledge that we need help.

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:25.840
But in this we can learn from Apollos.

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:31.840
Though eloquent, though well versed in the Scriptures, he accepted the help that he needed.

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:37.840
As a result, he benefited and all those that he would teach thereafter benefited.

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:39.840
So here's the point.

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:47.840
Can you think of someone like Priscilla or Aquila, who could give you the help you need?

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:56.840
If so, why not explain your needs and ask that person to join you in the ministry or on Bible studies?

00:12:56.840 --> 00:13:02.840
Now, if you've been serving Jehovah for a time, are you in a position to help others?

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:08.840
If so, we encourage you to be observant, take the initiative to offer assistance.

00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:15.840
If you see that a brother or sister would benefit from a kind suggestion, don't hold back.

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:20.840
At an appropriate time, you might begin the conversation in a friendly way by saying,

00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:25.840
may I offer you a suggestion, or here's what I try to do.

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:32.840
Remember, if we're kind and thoughtful like Aquila and Priscilla, likely our words and example

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:38.840
will prove to be a blessing to help our brothers find joy in making disciples too.

00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:43.840
Well, in the second part of this symposium, what have we learned?

00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:49.840
First, our brothers are a gift from Jehovah to help us make disciples.

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:59.840
And second, when we work together and support one another, all of us can find great joy in our precious ministry.

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:06.840
Now, Brother Garrett Loesch, a member of the governing body will consider the third and final talk of this symposium,

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:13.840
experience the joy of disciples making except Jehovah's help prayer.
