00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:08.269
Do not be quick to take offense as an example of a prohibition found in God's word.

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:14.070
Prohibitions typically begin with the words do not, or you must not.

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.070
Well, how should we view prohibitions found in Jehovah's Word?

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:25.070
There really a glimpse into his personality and his loving care for us.

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.070
For instance, a loving parent at times provides prohibitions to his children.

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:32.070
Don't play with fire.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.070
Don't play in the railroad tracks.

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.070
Don't throw stones at your brother or sister.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:38.070
Why?

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.070
For the child's protection and well-being and for the protection of others.

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:49.070
Similarly, our loving father, Jehovah, often provides prohibitions in his word

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.070
to help us spiritually, emotionally, and physically.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.070
We might view a prohibition as a do not enter sign

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.070
to an area that's full of landmines.

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:08.069
Well, sadly, the inclination, the tendency of imperfect, curious humans is to test the prohibitions.

00:01:08.069 --> 00:01:13.069
We might say, but the field of landmines is a shortcut to my destination,

00:01:13.069 --> 00:01:18.069
or there's a delicious fruit tree in that field.

00:01:18.069 --> 00:01:22.069
Well, Adam and Eve bypassed a do not enter sign for that very reason,

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:26.069
and it didn't turn out so well for them, or for their offspring.

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:32.069
And sadly, we've inherited the desire to test prohibitions.

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:39.069
Well, if we ever think that we can bypass a prohibition and avoid the landmines, the consequences,

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:44.069
then it's good for us to look behind the prohibition, the restriction,

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:47.069
and meditate on what Jehovah is trying to teach us.

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:53.069
Let's do that with two of the prohibitions found in Ecclesiastes chapter 7 today.

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:57.069
The first one is in our day text, and there it says,

00:01:57.069 --> 00:02:02.069
do not be quick to take offense.

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:06.069
For the taking of offense lodges in the bosom fools.

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:08.069
Well, what does it mean to take offense?

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.069
It seems obvious.

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:17.069
Other Bible translations use the expressions to be angry, to be indignant, to be vexed.

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:20.069
So what is Jehovah here asking us to do?

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:26.069
Is Jehovah saying that we should never be offended by anything or anyone

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:31.069
that we should forgive all offenses, regardless of how severe or frequent they are?

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:33.069
No.

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:38.069
Clearly, there are grievous sins that cannot be ignored in our relationship with others.

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:41.069
But what is Jehovah saying to us?

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:44.069
He's essentially saying, imitate my qualities.

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:47.069
I am slow to anger.

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:49.069
I am slow to be offended.

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:53.069
He's telling you and me, demonstrate the fruitage of my spirit.

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:58.069
Show self-control. Think this situation through. Don't explode.

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:02.069
Now, there's a multitude of reasons why we could become offended,

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:07.069
and how easy it is for us to be emotionally charged.

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:11.069
If someone insults us or questions our motives,

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:15.069
if our suggestion on a project isn't received well,

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:21.069
or it could be something as simple as when someone doesn't greet us the way that we would like them to.

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:24.069
And COVID has complicated matters further.

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:28.069
A handshake, a hug, fist bump, elbow bump.

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:30.069
Sometimes we don't know what to do.

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:34.069
Well, what can help if we are inclined to become offended?

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:40.069
Proverbs 1911 says, the insight of a man certainly slows down his anger.

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:44.069
And it is beauty on his part to overlook an offense.

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:48.069
So insight can help us to give the person the benefit of the doubt.

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:51.069
Maybe he or she was deep in thought.

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:54.069
Just received bad news.

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:58.069
Is hungry, is tired, is grieving, is injured.

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:01.069
The list can go on and on. We can give them the benefit of the doubt.

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:05.069
If we can let it go, we should let it go.

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:11.069
Well, why is Jehovah telling us to avoid the land of mine of taking offense?

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:14.069
What could happen if we take offense quickly?

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:19.069
Well, we could develop a bad reputation if it happens regularly.

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:21.069
But there's something even worse.

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:28.069
Proverbs 1417 says, the one who is quick to anger acts foolishly.

00:04:28.069 --> 00:04:31.069
So it's not just getting heated up, but it's acting in response to that.

00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:35.069
If we confront every perceived wrong done to us,

00:04:35.069 --> 00:04:39.069
we could harm ourselves or the other person either physically or emotionally.

00:04:39.069 --> 00:04:43.069
Is there a Bible example that illustrates that?

00:04:43.069 --> 00:04:49.069
Well, a marginal reference to today's text at the end of verse 9 is Genesis 4.5.

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:51.069
Let's go there.

00:04:51.069 --> 00:04:53.069
Genesis 4.

00:04:53.069 --> 00:04:56.069
And we'll start by reading verse 3.

00:04:56.069 --> 00:04:58.069
Get the context here.

00:04:58.069 --> 00:05:01.069
Genesis chapter 4 verse 3 says,

00:05:01.069 --> 00:05:07.069
After some time, Cain brought some fruits of the land as an offering to Jehovah,

00:05:07.069 --> 00:05:11.069
but Abel brought some firstlings of his flock, including their fat.

00:05:11.069 --> 00:05:15.069
While Jehovah looked with favor on Abel and on his offering,

00:05:15.069 --> 00:05:19.069
he did not look with any favor on Cain and on his offering.

00:05:19.069 --> 00:05:24.069
So Cain grew hot with anger and was dejected.

00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:27.069
Cain quickly became offended.

00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:29.069
He grew hot with anger.

00:05:29.069 --> 00:05:31.069
In spite of Jehovah's subsequent warning,

00:05:31.069 --> 00:05:37.069
he exploded with rage and killed his brother, sadly.

00:05:37.069 --> 00:05:41.069
What was it that quickly offended Cain?

00:05:41.069 --> 00:05:48.069
Because of Abel's faith, he offered a sacrifice of greater value than that of Cain.

00:05:48.069 --> 00:05:53.069
Abel was simply giving his own personal best to Jehovah

00:05:53.069 --> 00:05:56.069
and Cain quickly took offense.

00:05:56.069 --> 00:05:59.069
Is there a lesson for us?

00:05:59.069 --> 00:06:04.069
Well, there's no need to become heated up when a fellow believer outshines us,

00:06:04.069 --> 00:06:07.069
either here at Bethel or in the congregation.

00:06:07.069 --> 00:06:10.069
And there's certainly no place for character assassination.

00:06:10.069 --> 00:06:15.069
That is defaming another person in order to make oneself look better.

00:06:15.069 --> 00:06:18.069
We're all working toward the same goal.

00:06:18.069 --> 00:06:23.069
We're all trying to give Jehovah the honor and praise that he deserves.

00:06:23.069 --> 00:06:30.420
Let's not look at a related prohibition found in the same chapter of Ecclesiastes.

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:33.420
This time, verses 21 and 22.

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:43.660
There it says, also, do not take to heart every word that people say.

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:47.660
Otherwise, you may hear your servant calling down evil on you.

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:53.660
For you well know in your heart that many times you yourself have called down evil on others.

00:06:53.660 --> 00:07:00.660
This is another land mine that Jehovah is trying to protect us from by saying do not.

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:02.660
Don't go there.

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:05.660
As an education to Bible students and all of us,

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:07.660
the Enjoy Life Forever book asks the following question,

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:14.660
how can these verses help you to keep from overreacting when someone speaks negatively about you?

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:17.660
What is Jehovah teaching us in these verses?

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:19.660
What is he asking us to do?

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:22.660
Jehovah is essentially saying imitate my qualities.

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:26.660
I'm willing to pardon thoughtless speech.

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:29.660
How about you? Are you willing to do the same?

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:31.660
It's like he's reminding you and me.

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:33.660
Keep a balanced view of your brothers and sisters.

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:35.660
Don't expect perfection of them.

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:38.660
Remember that you two are imperfect.

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:41.660
Well, why is Jehovah telling us to avoid this land mine?

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:43.660
Because it can lead to problems.

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:47.660
He knows that we're setting ourselves up for disappointment if we expect perfection

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:49.660
of our brothers and sisters.

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:53.660
It has the potential to stumble us or shipwreck our faith.

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:59.660
And James 3.8 reminds us no human can tame the tongue.

00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:03.660
It is unruly and injurious full of deadly poison.

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:07.660
Furthermore, as Ecclesiastes 7.22 indicates,

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:11.660
we each have that venomous instrument in our own head.

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:14.660
And we certainly have said things that we regret.

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:17.660
Well, I know I have at least.

00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:21.660
Is there a Bible example that illustrates the harm that can come

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:24.660
by taking to heart negative talk?

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:31.660
Again, a marginal reference to verse 21 is 1 Samuel 24 verse 9.

00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:36.220
1 Samuel 24 verse 9.

00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:41.220
And here we see a dialogue between King Saul and David.

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:45.220
David had an opportunity to injure Saul, but he did not.

00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:48.220
Notice the conversation.

00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:50.220
It's 1 Samuel 24 verse 9.

00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:54.220
David said to Saul, why do you listen to the words of men who say,

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:57.220
look, David is seeking to harm you.

00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:02.860
Saul was giving his heart to lies about David's motives and actions.

00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:03.860
Why?

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:09.860
Because Saul sadly was obsessed with his own reputation.

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:15.860
He was seeking justification for ill will toward David so he believed lies.

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:17.860
What is the lesson for us?

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:22.860
We must avoid the landmine of taking to heart negative talk about us.

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:29.860
Instead, we can find joy knowing that Jehovah is the one who examines us and approves us.

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:31.860
So what have we considered?

00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:36.860
Jehovah provides prohibitions for our benefit.

00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:40.860
As we do our best to avoid the landmines of quickly taking offense,

00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:42.860
taking to heart negative talk,

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:47.860
we will benefit ourselves and others around us and find joy in our service to Jehovah.
