00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:09.839
Welcome, welcome, welcome to this month's broadcast.

00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:15.839
Here is a little sample of what will be contained in our program.

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:22.839
We'll meet brothers and sisters who've learned to see and treat others impartially.

00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:24.839
What helped them?

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:29.839
And how can all of us be united in a divided world?

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:31.839
We'll find out.

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:36.840
Have you ever needed to muster up courage to do what's right?

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.840
Are you enduring disappointment?

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.840
We'll see what we can learn from the example of Samuel.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:54.840
And Jesus showed us how to see the good in people to be loving and kind, just like a child.

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.840
That's the message of our new music video.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.840
Yes, there's much to look forward to.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:28.079
And this May 2020 edition of J. W. Broadcasting.

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:34.079
The Ways Rejoice is the appealing theme of this year's conventions.

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:39.079
The governing body would like to give you a preview of the program.

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:43.900
Let's take a look.

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.900
Everyone wants to be happy.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.900
But we all face problems, problems that are hard to deal with.

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:59.319
So, can you ever really be happy?

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:18.879
At the 2020 convention of Jehovah's Witnesses, you will learn how to find joy even when life is hard.

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:27.909
And how God has made it possible for us to be happy now and forever.

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:31.909
Happiness might seem hard to find, but it isn't.

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:41.539
Come and see for yourself.

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:47.539
That preview reminds us of the wonderful convention program of last year,

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:52.539
including the feature film about faithful Josiah.

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:56.539
What was involved in producing that drama?

00:02:56.539 --> 00:03:03.539
Please watch the following video that reveals what transpired behind the scenes.

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:18.310
Where do you begin an important project?

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:23.310
Like the story of Josiah, love Jehovah, hate what is bad.

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.310
You begin with prayerful consideration.

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:31.310
It's a serious responsibility, part of being loyal to Jehovah and his word.

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:38.310
Therefore, many hours of careful research goes into the first step, writing a script.

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:43.310
The script is then visualized through a step called storyboarding.

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:52.150
But it's not just the script and storyboarding that requires attention to accuracy.

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:58.150
Costumes must be thoroughly researched so that their components, styles, colors,

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:05.939
and even the types of fabrics appear as historically accurate as possible.

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:09.939
The production must also accurately depict the times being represented,

00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:12.939
while making the best use of donated funds.

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:14.939
How can this be done?

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:18.939
For the story of Josiah, the solution was to film at Bethel Locations,

00:04:18.939 --> 00:04:22.939
such as the Studio Spaces at Mount Ebo.

00:04:22.939 --> 00:04:26.939
Set construction began early in 2018.

00:04:26.939 --> 00:04:30.939
The production team designed and built three flexible sets,

00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:35.939
so that with easy propositions, they could be in multiple locations.

00:04:35.939 --> 00:04:42.240
Even the exterior Jerusalem city scenes were filmed indoors.

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:55.819
Many brothers and sisters from local congregations served as extras for the crowd scenes.

00:04:56.819 --> 00:04:59.819
With an eye to biblical and historical accuracy,

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:05.819
the makeup team transformed the actors into characters from King Josiah's time.

00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:08.819
There were so many details to get right.

00:05:08.819 --> 00:05:38.360
For a large portion of the drama, filming in front of a green screen

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:43.360
enabled the visual effects team to construct accurate environments digitally.

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:51.110
Many layers of character action, called plates, were assembled with digital environments

00:05:51.110 --> 00:06:21.189
to produce complex visuals for the closing festival scene,

00:06:21.189 --> 00:06:26.189
which required 14,000 Israelites and many sheep.

00:06:26.189 --> 00:06:31.189
3D models were made and duplicated to simulate the large crowd.

00:06:31.189 --> 00:06:40.220
In July 2018, the production packed up and moved to an outdoor location

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:43.220
at Watchtower Farms in Wauk Hill, New York.

00:06:43.220 --> 00:07:05.220
In August, the last scene was filmed back to the Mount Ebo studio.

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:11.220
After 45 days of filming and with over four terabytes of footage captured,

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:14.220
the team had finished production.

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:18.220
The project moved to the editing facilities at Patterson, New York.

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:27.060
But what more could be done so the account betrayed could touch our hearts?

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:34.399
A colorist applied a look to the overall film to enhance the picture's quality and mood.

00:07:34.399 --> 00:07:42.410
Additional sound effects, such as footsteps and sound of dry grasping rustled,

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:48.410
or recorded to make the on-screen action more natural and compelling.

00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:52.410
Finally, the musical soundtrack was composed, recorded,

00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:58.170
and added to the movie to enhance the appeal to our hearts.

00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:02.170
The work on the story of Josiah loved Jehovah, heatwood is bad,

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:06.170
was done to strengthen Jehovah's people worldwide.

00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:11.170
You're not alone. Jehovah is with you.

00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:20.170
This powerful story also assists parents as they teach their children the power of God's word and promise.

00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:25.170
These words that I'm commanding you today must be on your heart.

00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:30.170
And you must enculcate them and your sons and speak of them when you sit in your house.

00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:36.509
And when you walk on the road and when you lie down and when you get up.

00:08:36.509 --> 00:08:41.509
So that it may always go well with you and your sons after you.

00:08:42.509 --> 00:08:49.759
Because you are doing what is good and right in the eyes of Jehovah, you are God.

00:08:49.759 --> 00:09:05.919
The story of Josiah has proven to be yet another example of how Jehovah continues to provide a button spiritual food and support for his people worldwide.

00:09:05.919 --> 00:09:11.919
That video certainly brought the Bible account to life for us.

00:09:11.919 --> 00:09:18.919
You may want to go back and review the full feature film again from our website.

00:09:18.919 --> 00:09:37.919
We might mention that we've had just a few parents write in expressing concern that some of our videos depict scenes that could have an effect on children who have been protected from anything even hinting at an act of violence.

00:09:37.919 --> 00:09:40.919
We very much appreciate the concern.

00:09:40.919 --> 00:09:50.919
However, when portraying a Bible account, we cannot ignore the message Jehovah's Office to preserve in his word.

00:09:50.919 --> 00:10:00.919
We don't feel comfortable watering down the inspired insight that Jehovah has preserved for the benefit of true worshipers.

00:10:00.919 --> 00:10:07.919
However, as you've observed, we do so as tastefully as possible.

00:10:07.919 --> 00:10:12.919
We don't show actual violent acts or bloodshed.

00:10:12.919 --> 00:10:19.919
A scriptural precedent might be found in 2 Chronicles chapter 20, verse 13.

00:10:19.919 --> 00:10:29.919
Jehoshaphat was describing a great crowd of enemy nations that were about to launch an attack against God's people.

00:10:29.919 --> 00:10:41.919
He described the possible disaster quite graphically, referring to the possibility of death by the sword, by pestilence, or by famine.

00:10:41.919 --> 00:10:45.919
Who was he sharing this disturbing information with?

00:10:45.919 --> 00:10:51.919
2 Chronicles chapter 20, verse 13 tells us.

00:10:51.919 --> 00:11:03.919
Meanwhile, all those of Judah were standing before Jehovah along with their little ones, their wives, and their children.

00:11:03.919 --> 00:11:10.919
Jehovah wanted all, including the young ones, to understand what was coming.

00:11:10.919 --> 00:11:19.919
Parents likewise need to give their children a realistic idea of what we all will face in the near future.

00:11:19.919 --> 00:11:28.919
Many parents choose to help their children appreciate the graphic visual imagery of a Bible-based video,

00:11:28.919 --> 00:11:36.919
while at the same time building trust in Jehovah who will be with them in times of distress.

00:11:36.919 --> 00:11:48.919
This is similar to what they do when reading a graphic biblical account to their children from the scriptures, such as from the book of Revelation.

00:11:48.919 --> 00:12:05.919
Be assured that we'll continue to be sensitive to the feelings of you parents when we produce a video that's based on a Bible account that includes descriptions of warfare or other incidents of violent actions.

00:12:05.919 --> 00:12:16.919
We'll do so with care, while not ignoring the powerful details depicted in the inspired word of God.

00:12:16.919 --> 00:12:27.710
The theme for this program is, be childlike, but not childish.

00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:34.710
1 Corinthians chapter 14 verse 20 is our theme scripture.

00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:48.710
Brothers, do not become young children in your understanding, but be young children as to badness and become full grown in your understanding.

00:12:49.710 --> 00:13:00.710
In this single verse, we're told not to be like a young child in one way, and we're told to be like a young child in another way.

00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:09.710
We should not be like a child when it comes to understanding, and we should be like a child when it comes to badness.

00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:22.710
During this discussion, let's focus on three ways we should not be like a child, and then let's talk about three ways we should be like a child.

00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:37.710
Please turn to Hebrews chapter 5 verses 13 and 14, and let's identify negative trait number one that we do not want to imitate.

00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:48.710
For everyone who continues to feed on milk is unacquainted with the word of righteousness, for he is a young child.

00:13:48.710 --> 00:14:01.710
But solid food belongs to mature people, to those who, through use, have their powers of discernment trained to distinguish both right and wrong.

00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:09.710
So the negative trait that children have is immature feeding habits.

00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:19.710
Think about it. Young children have a tendency to eat what they like, regardless of its nutritional value.

00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:29.710
Most young ones would be perfectly happy eating ice cream, candy, cookies, and other sweets for all of their meals.

00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:43.710
But now we ask, what do our spiritual appetites and feeding habits reveal about us? Consider, how do we spend our free time?

00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:52.710
Do we squander voluminous hours watching television or reading material that provides little or no spiritual nutrition?

00:14:53.710 --> 00:15:01.710
Or do we make wise use of our free time to take in solid spiritual food?

00:15:01.710 --> 00:15:11.710
When we receive a new issue of the watchtower, do we merely scan through it, looking at a few highlights, and then do something else?

00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:18.710
Do we take time to research deeper spiritual truths so as to fully understand them?

00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:28.710
Do we take time to really meditate? Meditation is not daydreaming. Meditation is bridal-focused thought.

00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:36.710
Pause your reading to ask questions such as, what does this teach me about Jehovah?

00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:42.710
With whom can I share this information? What's Jehovah telling me?

00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:51.710
How does this fit in? With other things, I know about this subject. How can I make application?

00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:58.710
James 125 encourages us to peer into God's Word.

00:15:58.710 --> 00:16:05.710
According to the reference Bible, peer literally means to stoop beside.

00:16:05.710 --> 00:16:19.710
To illustrate, simply reading through the Bible could be likened to walking quickly through the world's greatest museum and periodically glancing at the various displays.

00:16:19.710 --> 00:16:34.710
You'll learn something, but meditatively peering into God's Word can be likened to stopping all along the museum route, and even stooping down, and closely examining from different angles,

00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:48.710
the artifacts, exhibitions, and displays. Now, our knowledge and appreciation are going to be enhanced much more.

00:16:48.710 --> 00:17:03.710
Yes, our spiritual appetite and feeding habits reveal much about whether we have done away with a trait of a young child, namely, immature feeding habits.

00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:17.710
Now, please turn to Ephesians chapter 4, verse 14. Let's discern from this scripture, negative trait number 2, that we don't want to imitate.

00:17:17.710 --> 00:17:36.710
So we should no longer be children, tossed about as by waves, and carried here and there by every wind of teaching, by means of the trickery of men, by means of cunning and deceptive schemes.

00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:44.710
So what's the negative trait? Young children are easily tricked or fooled.

00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:56.710
This scripture likens being easily tricked about what's right or wrong to being tossed about by the waves of the ocean and blown around by the wind.

00:17:56.710 --> 00:18:07.710
If you think of a piece of wood floating in a turbulent ocean or a piece of paper in a windstorm, there's no stability or direction.

00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:22.710
Both can be easily maneuvered to go anywhere, take any position. Well, that's true of very young children who often can be easily deceived.

00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:36.710
For example, if given a choice between a shiny coin of little value and paper money of great value, the shiny coin will likely be chosen.

00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:56.710
But now here's the point. What do our spiritual choices reveal about us? Do our choices in regard to music and other entertainment, clothing and grooming indicate that we're being fooled even slightly by Satan and his world?

00:18:57.710 --> 00:19:07.710
Yes, Satan is bent on tricking us. But Jehovah tells us, in 1 Corinthians 1420, the scripture we read earlier,

00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:20.440
do not become young children in your understanding. But now, please turn to Matthew chapter 11, 16 and 17.

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:33.440
Here we'll find the third negative trait of a child that we do not want to imitate, with whom will I compare this generation?

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:41.440
It is like young children sitting in the marketplaces who call out to their playmates, saying,

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:51.440
we played the flute for you, but you did not dance. We wailed, but you did not beat yourselves in grief.

00:19:51.440 --> 00:20:09.440
Jesus was saying that adult people were acting like children. Children love to play, so the negative trait of young children is that they prefer play over responsibility.

00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:24.440
Think about it. The vast majority of the waking hours of a small child are spent playing. Play, play and more play. Most of their life is fun in games.

00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:35.440
But later, when the child goes to school, what does he get the time to do so? He has to take it from his playtime.

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:47.440
But now, spiritually speaking, we can ask ourselves, how far have we progressed in buying out time from our playtime?

00:20:47.440 --> 00:21:03.440
Ephesians 5.16 encourages us to make the best use of our time. Literally, according to the footnote, this scripture is telling us to buy out the appointed time.

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:16.440
That is, buy it from less important things. So the question for all of us is, have we bought out the majority of our playtime for more important spiritual responsibilities?

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:37.910
Now, we've discussed three negative traits of a young child that we want to avoid. If we had time, we could have discussed other negative traits to be avoided, such as children tend to have a short attention span. They're easily distracted.

00:21:37.910 --> 00:21:49.910
Their curiosity often gets them into trouble, and they generally need a lot of time and attention. They're high maintenance.

00:21:49.910 --> 00:21:57.910
But now, let's briefly discuss three positive traits of a young child that we do well to imitate.

00:21:57.910 --> 00:22:07.910
Positive characteristic number one is in 1 Corinthians 1420, which we read at the outset.

00:22:07.910 --> 00:22:19.910
That scripture tells us to, quote, be young children as to badness. So what's the characteristic that we want to imitate?

00:22:19.910 --> 00:22:33.910
Young children are innocent in experience when it comes to badness. Or put another way, they haven't done many truly bad things.

00:22:33.910 --> 00:22:48.910
Like children, we don't want to gain knowledge or experience in what is bad. For example, when it comes to pornography, we want no experience whatsoever.

00:22:48.910 --> 00:23:19.380
In regard to this filthy thing of Satan's world. When it comes to television programs that are designated for a mature audience, remember to tell yourself, I'm not old enough. I'm a young child. For positive characteristic number two, let's consider Matthew chapter 18 verses two through four.

00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:40.380
So calling a young child to him, he, Jesus, stood him in their midst and said, truly I say to you, unless you turn around and become as young children, you will buy no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens.

00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:50.380
Therefore, whoever will humble himself like this young child is the one who is the greatest in the kingdom of the heavens.

00:23:50.380 --> 00:24:01.380
What's the desirable trait? Young children are humble and teachable. Young children ask many questions, because they want to learn.

00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:21.380
But grown-ups are often hesitant to ask questions. Why? They don't want to look uninformed. But acting like we know something when we don't, is actually dishonest, and probably motivated by pride.

00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:43.819
The point is, don't be afraid to reveal what you don't know. Remain humble and teachable like a child. Now, let's identify desirable trait number three by going to Matthew 21, 15, and 16.

00:24:43.819 --> 00:25:02.819
When the chief priest and the scribe saw the marvelous things he did, and the boys who were shouting in the temple, save we pray the Son of David. They became indignant and said to him, do you hear what these are saying?

00:25:02.819 --> 00:25:12.819
Jesus said to them, yes, did you never read this out of the mouth of children and infants? You have brought forth praise?

00:25:12.819 --> 00:25:23.819
So what desirable characteristic can we identify? Young children are exuberant and enthusiastic.

00:25:23.819 --> 00:25:51.819
Well, in like manner, we want to remain exuberant and expressive about Jehovah, Jesus, the kingdom, and other spiritual things. Some 145.7 encourages us to bubble over and shout joyfully because of these wonderful things, and we never want to lose that childlike enthusiasm.

00:25:51.819 --> 00:26:17.819
Well, there we have three desirable traits of a young child that we want to do our utmost to imitate. If we had time, we could discuss several other positive characteristics such as children tend to be trusting, not prejudiced and not hypocritical.

00:26:17.819 --> 00:26:30.819
But now, in review, may each of us prayerfully strive not to be childish when it comes to number one, immature feeding habits.

00:26:30.819 --> 00:26:56.819
Number two, being easily tricked or fooled, and number three, preferring play over responsibility. On the other hand, may each of us prayerfully strive to be childlike when it comes to being number one, innocent and inexperienced concerning badness.

00:26:56.819 --> 00:27:19.779
Number two, humble and teachable. And number three, exuberant and enthusiastic about spiritual things. The Bible contains many accounts of fateful men and women. We can learn from their examples.

00:27:19.779 --> 00:27:26.779
In the following dramatization, notice what a family learns from Samuel.

00:27:26.779 --> 00:28:02.079
Samuel was only my age when Jehovah spoke to him. He respected Eli, but he had to stand up for what's right. I never thought that I'd have to do something similar.

00:28:02.079 --> 00:28:50.019
I loved my brother, and I always wanted to be like him. But those pictures of him partying with kids from school showed he was living a double life. I didn't want to get him in trouble, but I knew I had to say something. I told him he had to tell mom and dad.

00:28:50.019 --> 00:29:37.019
He warned me not to tell him, but Samuel was courageous and did not hide anything. And Jehovah himself was with him. I couldn't hide this. Talking to my parents wasn't easy, but I knew it was the right thing to do.

00:29:37.019 --> 00:29:54.069
Of course we were proud of Danny, but at the time we were a little distracted.

00:29:54.069 --> 00:30:27.640
Maybe somehow it was all just a misunderstanding. We needed to know what was going on. We just wanted to help him.

00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:52.710
We couldn't help but blame ourselves for what was happening. Then we thought back to Samuel's example.

00:30:52.710 --> 00:31:06.220
Samuel, you need to listen to us. You're getting old, Samuel. And your sons are not like you. They cheat and they take pride.

00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:12.220
The vent Jehovah's rules. Any way they please.

00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:17.220
Even faithful Samuel had sons who deviated from Jehovah's standards.

00:31:17.220 --> 00:32:05.039
We wanted to help our son. Just a Samuel didn't alter his course, and Jehovah stood by him. We knew if we did things his way, he'd stand by us.

00:32:05.039 --> 00:32:13.039
Did you see the loyalty the younger son showed by his bringing the matter to the attention of his parents?

00:32:13.039 --> 00:32:20.039
Did you also notice the loyalty the parents showed by going to the elders for assistance?

00:32:20.039 --> 00:32:34.039
After the parents were able to talk to the elders, we hope that the older son was able to get the help he needed and that the discipline brought him to his senses.

00:32:35.039 --> 00:32:40.039
Has your child left Jehovah? Do you blame yourself?

00:32:40.039 --> 00:32:52.670
If so, remember that Jehovah stood by faithful Samuel, and he'll stand by you. He'll help you endure.

00:32:52.670 --> 00:33:00.670
Another challenge we face today is remaining united in a deeply divided world.

00:33:00.670 --> 00:33:10.670
During the 1950s and 1960s, racial tensions in the United States greatly intensified.

00:33:10.670 --> 00:33:18.670
How were Jehovah's people affected during that period? And how did they maintain unity?

00:33:18.670 --> 00:33:43.650
Let's look for the answers to those questions in the following report.

00:33:43.650 --> 00:33:50.700
My mother always said, Jehovah did not intend for all of us to look alike.

00:33:50.700 --> 00:34:00.700
In those early days, we would work every house in the county, like families, white families, any color.

00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:08.699
That school, that was pressurized, being involved with the racial activity.

00:34:08.699 --> 00:34:18.699
We would hear about the problems and the issues. It would be in the news and you would know what was going on in the South.

00:34:18.699 --> 00:34:37.699
Some may wonder, how is it that our people, that is Jehovah's Witnesses, Black and White, could maintain such unity when the world around them was falling apart?

00:34:37.699 --> 00:34:49.699
grew up in Central New York, Utica, New York. I remember in the Kingdom of ministry back in 1956, there were articles about serving with Anita's great.

00:34:49.699 --> 00:34:53.699
They needed some of the Black friends to serve in the South.

00:34:53.699 --> 00:35:01.389
I married my husband, Earl McGee, June 2, 1956.

00:35:01.389 --> 00:35:09.389
When we were married, brother TJ Sullowing gave the talk at Hallendale Convention on serving with Anita's great.

00:35:09.389 --> 00:35:19.389
He encouraged not only families, but he says new married couples, so we planned for it, and he wrote the branch.

00:35:19.389 --> 00:35:30.389
We were assigned to Florida, and then in 1962 we started in the circuit work, and our first circuit was in Alabama, and it was not integrated.

00:35:30.389 --> 00:35:45.389
We served together, Edna and I did, and the Pioneer work by assignment. The last assignment was by the society assigning us to North Carolina, and then there to the circuit work.

00:35:45.389 --> 00:35:53.389
After the first circuit, which was in the Carolinas and Georgia, we were assigned to Gilead.

00:35:53.389 --> 00:36:07.739
We got married in April 23rd, 1949. I've been full-time service, 70 years, for a while.

00:36:07.739 --> 00:36:11.739
I was assigned to circuit 18 in Alabama.

00:36:11.739 --> 00:36:28.500
My first circuit assignment was in Mississippi. It had the reputation as the worst state in the Union for race relations, and then after we got there, there were three civil rights workers who were killed

00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:39.980
in Philadelphia, Mississippi. That was our circuit, so those were the things we had to deal with.

00:36:39.980 --> 00:36:50.510
We were busy in our ministry, so it didn't bother us very much. The black work, the black, and the white work for white.

00:36:50.510 --> 00:36:56.510
So we just obeyed the customary law of staying segregated.

00:36:56.510 --> 00:37:02.510
Lots of movements were happening, and people were very hostile.

00:37:02.510 --> 00:37:07.510
When there was a march or any tension, we were serving there in Alabama.

00:37:07.510 --> 00:37:18.510
We wouldn't go to the town on Saturday afternoon to do street witnessing, because if there was a rally or something going on, we would just stay in the neighborhood.

00:37:18.510 --> 00:37:27.510
A lot of what they call back them freedom riders, people getting on bus is going south, and people coming in to register borders.

00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:43.510
In fact, some of the civil rights organizations were set up in Mississippi and weren't pretty strong, so as a result, they would think that because we were active in going door to door, we could just incorporate civil rights issues and things like that into our work.

00:37:43.510 --> 00:37:53.510
One of our classmates, and the 27th class, was a black brother of fellow student, and we became very close friends there.

00:37:53.510 --> 00:38:04.510
After we left Gilead, we were going to our assignments. We stopped at a convention in Alabama, and the convention was segregated.

00:38:04.510 --> 00:38:14.510
One race on one side, one race on another, and it was very difficult, painful for us not to be able to closely associate with our dear friend.

00:38:14.510 --> 00:38:24.510
So we got this talk show on the television. The circuit over C&I went also a Catholic priest and a Piscopal minister.

00:38:24.510 --> 00:38:30.510
So the Piscopal minister, the young minister, asked, what were we doing about the marching?

00:38:30.510 --> 00:38:38.510
So I told him that we weren't doing anything about the marching. Well, that sort of contrast, I'm black and he's white.

00:38:38.510 --> 00:38:47.510
They weren't stopping their marching to help us priesthood into the kingdom, so we weren't going to stop preaching good news into the kingdom to help them march.

00:38:48.510 --> 00:39:01.510
The brothers always were interested in each other. So if there was a black congregation and a white congregation, we had interest and fellow feeling for both.

00:39:01.510 --> 00:39:09.510
The rule was we were not to meet together, and we couldn't meet, but we could talk to one another and we could visit one another.

00:39:09.510 --> 00:39:17.510
So that think there was great support on both sides, black and white brothers back in those days.

00:39:17.510 --> 00:39:25.510
If we had a problem getting a facility, for example, they'd have contacts and they could get certain things done. So basically we worked together.

00:39:27.789 --> 00:39:34.789
The congregation started integrating after certain civil rights laws were passed.

00:39:34.789 --> 00:39:46.789
We had a big meeting of all the elders and worked out the territory assignments and whatever else was necessary to have integrated congregations.

00:39:46.789 --> 00:39:56.789
Some friends would feel and maybe rightly so at the time that there would be some violence if we integrated.

00:39:56.789 --> 00:40:01.789
There probably was some kingdom always damage and things like that as a result.

00:40:01.789 --> 00:40:13.789
But the fact is there was integration going in other places in the schools and things like that in the universities and colleges, and so it was obvious that if they could do it, then we even more so.

00:40:14.789 --> 00:40:23.789
The process of integration was successful because it was under Jehovah's direction.

00:40:23.789 --> 00:40:38.789
Both black and white, we had the same thing in common. We loved Jehovah. And despite us, Jehovah got it done for us and brought us together.

00:40:38.789 --> 00:40:43.789
And we had been unified ever since.

00:40:43.789 --> 00:40:53.789
Everyone could see that we were united. One brother was working from door to door, black and white, and the lady came to the door white.

00:40:53.789 --> 00:41:04.789
And she said she was happy to see this unity take place. She looked forward to it for a long time.

00:41:04.789 --> 00:41:20.789
We have formed with Jehovah's help by means of his Holy Spirit, a worldwide brotherhood. Granted, they have their imperfections, but it is a brotherhood and something to be truly marveled at.

00:41:20.789 --> 00:41:33.039
The brothers began to feel what we knew was true. We were all one organization. They began to feel it being to experience it.

00:41:34.039 --> 00:41:47.039
We loved Jehovah and we loved our brothers. So there you have it. How could you fail to have unity when Jehovah had drawn you together?

00:41:47.039 --> 00:42:06.380
Satan is the prime one to divide people. Jesus died for the whole world, a man, so who would that exclude? No one.

00:42:06.380 --> 00:42:13.380
Did you notice what helped our brothers maintain unity during that difficult time?

00:42:13.380 --> 00:42:28.380
First, despite prevailing custom, our brothers, black and white, supported each other, helped each other, and worked together to advance kingdom interests.

00:42:28.380 --> 00:42:37.380
Second, they remained focused on the ministry and did not get involved with social movements.

00:42:37.380 --> 00:42:50.380
They wanted all to know that God's kingdom is the only solution to mankind's problems, including the plague of prejudice and racial inequality.

00:42:50.380 --> 00:42:56.380
Third, they demonstrated love for Jehovah and love for the brothers.

00:42:56.380 --> 00:43:13.010
As brother Thompson said, how could you fail to have unity when Jehovah had drawn you together? Impartiality, humility, kindness.

00:43:13.010 --> 00:43:21.010
These are godly qualities and childlike qualities that our new music video illustrates.

00:43:34.070 --> 00:47:59.739
Beautiful song. We need a childlike heart more than ever. In many parts of the world, it's customary to judge people on the basis of their race or age or by how much money they have.

00:47:59.739 --> 00:48:08.739
In our next segment, we'll hear from brothers and sisters who have successfully resisted such influences.

00:48:20.619 --> 00:48:33.769
I grew up in a country where people judged you according to the color of your skin. There was black, white, mixed race, but we all kept separate.

00:48:33.769 --> 00:48:39.769
I needed to learn not to see color but to see people.

00:48:39.769 --> 00:48:45.769
Even though it's such a multicultural area, there is still this prejudice that exists.

00:48:45.769 --> 00:48:54.769
I've seen a witness times where ones from another country are often left isolated or are treated in a way that they're not welcome here.

00:48:54.769 --> 00:49:02.769
If we're not careful, these attitudes could creep into the congregation. We could have isolated groups of cultures that maybe would stick together.

00:49:05.769 --> 00:49:11.769
In the area where I grew up, young ones show great respect for older ones.

00:49:11.769 --> 00:49:26.389
Older ones, however, do not give much importance to young people. This attitude or culture has a major impact on recommendations of young ones as elders in the congregation.

00:49:26.389 --> 00:49:34.389
We might say, in my opinion, is too young to be appointed as an elder in the congregation.

00:49:34.389 --> 00:49:45.389
In this area, people sort of open up to you when you appear rich. In some areas, they would even wonder what you're doing there if you don't have the right kind of looks.

00:49:45.389 --> 00:49:51.389
In terms of what you can afford to wear, what kind of car you can afford to drive. What your profession is.

00:49:51.389 --> 00:50:02.389
If we brought that with us into the Christian congregation, then what Solomon mentions, it could be the case that we actively seek the friendship of those that we regard to be rich.

00:50:02.389 --> 00:50:04.389
And abandon those that are poor.

00:50:04.389 --> 00:50:11.389
I like the example in Galatians with Peter. He grew up in an area where there was a lot of prejudice.

00:50:11.389 --> 00:50:21.389
It wasn't something that he overcame straight away. If I'm not careful, I think it would be easy for me to slide back to see people as a different race.

00:50:21.389 --> 00:50:26.389
And that would affect the way I view my brothers and sisters in the congregation.

00:50:26.389 --> 00:50:33.389
The article mentions that when we use the Bible, it helps us to make changes.

00:50:33.389 --> 00:50:38.389
We need to constantly look at ourselves so that we can continue to make progress.

00:50:38.389 --> 00:50:56.469
In the article we mentioned about opening our hearts wide, whether it be working with them on the ministry, having them over socially, not just from the same group that we might be comfortable with, but actually with different ones from different backgrounds.

00:50:57.469 --> 00:51:05.469
Timothy was still a young man, but the Apostle Paul had given him heavy responsibility in the congregation.

00:51:05.469 --> 00:51:17.469
The article mentions that the scriptures do not give an exact age for recommendation of brothers as ministerial servants or elders.

00:51:17.469 --> 00:51:28.949
Recommending a younger brother as an elder in the congregation has been a great blessing to us.

00:51:32.190 --> 00:51:37.190
In the article, there was a little phrase that has become a guiding principle for me.

00:51:37.190 --> 00:51:42.190
Jehovah does not judge our relationship with him by what we possess.

00:51:42.190 --> 00:51:57.190
So when I meet new brothers and sisters, and for a moment, I'm tempted to judge or view them according to those sentiments as to whether they are rich or poor, that principle comes into my mind.

00:51:57.190 --> 00:52:03.190
My focus therefore shifts to who they really are in terms of their devotion to Jehovah.

00:52:03.190 --> 00:52:08.190
Their faith, that is what we build friendships are.

00:52:08.190 --> 00:52:17.190
I have friends from different cultures, different races, and I don't see them as colour, but I see my brother and my sister.

00:52:17.190 --> 00:52:25.190
I've got the most amazing friendships with ones from different backgrounds and cultures, something I would always cherish.

00:52:31.860 --> 00:52:36.860
So our congregation is a wonderful place for everybody.

00:52:36.860 --> 00:52:39.860
There's no emphasis on who is rich and who is poor.

00:52:39.860 --> 00:52:43.860
Friendship I build on the basis of our love for Jehovah.

00:52:43.860 --> 00:53:07.139
This month's program encouraged us to be childlike.

00:53:07.139 --> 00:53:13.139
We learned from the encouraging example of servants of Jehovah in the past.

00:53:13.139 --> 00:53:23.139
We saw that love for Jehovah and our brothers unite us, even during times of social unrest.

00:53:23.139 --> 00:53:32.139
We were reminded that like a child, we want to be impartial, loving and kind.

00:53:32.139 --> 00:53:45.139
And we heard expressions from brothers who have learned to treat others fairly, no matter their race, age, wealth, or anything else that could divide them.

00:53:45.139 --> 00:53:55.139
Now it's time for our video postcard, which comes to us from the Czech Republic also called Czechia.

00:53:55.139 --> 00:54:05.139
Czechia is a land of deep forest, farmland, vineyards, as well as medieval castles, towns and cities.

00:54:05.139 --> 00:54:10.139
Prague, the capital, was established more than a thousand years ago.

00:54:10.139 --> 00:54:13.139
It has a rich religious history.

00:54:13.139 --> 00:54:18.139
God's name can be found on many churches and structures.

00:54:18.139 --> 00:54:24.139
Czechia is home to more than 15,000 Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:54:24.139 --> 00:54:28.139
There are 32 congregations in Prague.

00:54:28.139 --> 00:54:37.139
This is the Prague Devetset Congregation, which has 84 publishers, including 13 regular pioneers.

00:54:37.139 --> 00:54:40.139
Their territory is large and diverse.

00:54:40.139 --> 00:54:49.139
They preach in the historic center of Prague in neighborhoods, parks, and on university campuses.

00:54:49.139 --> 00:54:58.139
The congregation includes a Spanish-speaking group with 12 publishers of which eight are regular pioneers.

00:54:58.139 --> 00:55:01.139
This group serves the entire city.

00:55:01.139 --> 00:55:18.019
Speniac and Jarmala Boutsafal helped to secretly produce Bible literature during the communist regime when the work of Jehovah's Witnesses was banned.

00:55:18.019 --> 00:55:27.019
Speniac was forced to work in a coal mine for remaining neutral and refusing to serve in the military.

00:55:27.019 --> 00:55:33.019
After the regime changed, he served as a circuit overseer.

00:55:33.019 --> 00:55:46.019
Our brothers and sisters in the Prague Devetset Congregation send their warm, loving greetings to all of you.

00:55:46.019 --> 00:55:53.019
Earlier, we showed you a preview of this year's Always Rejoice Conventions.

00:55:53.019 --> 00:56:02.019
But would you like a glimpse of this year's feature film, which brings to life the story of courageous Nehemiah?

00:56:02.019 --> 00:56:05.019
Please enjoy.

00:56:05.019 --> 00:56:14.840
Far from Israel lived a Jew, whom the King of Persia trusted with his life.

00:56:14.840 --> 00:56:21.840
He believed his people were carrying on pure worship in Jerusalem until one day.

00:56:21.840 --> 00:56:31.519
The walls of Jerusalem are broken down, and its gates have been burned with fire.

00:56:31.519 --> 00:56:37.239
Most of the people ignore God's law.

00:56:37.239 --> 00:56:50.599
Walls was only the beginning.

00:56:50.599 --> 00:56:53.599
We have many powerful enemies.

00:56:53.599 --> 00:56:57.599
I recommend you turn the accusation of its addition against Nehemiah.

00:56:57.599 --> 00:56:59.599
Nehemiah is far away in Shushan.

00:56:59.599 --> 00:57:00.599
Who is going to tell him?

00:57:00.599 --> 00:57:02.599
This is my province.

00:57:02.599 --> 00:57:05.599
Out here, I decide what to do.

00:57:05.599 --> 00:57:08.599
I have a right to live where I choose, and so do you.

00:57:08.599 --> 00:57:12.599
They would need help to face what was about to come next.

00:57:12.599 --> 00:57:17.599
Every man must find his own joy, and I intend to find mine.

00:57:17.599 --> 00:57:21.599
Why should you complain when everyone else approves?

00:57:21.599 --> 00:57:25.599
We let mere threats frighten us in the stopping. They'll have achieved their goal.

00:57:25.599 --> 00:57:28.599
Are you gonna wait until they start killing us?

00:57:28.599 --> 00:57:30.599
Will power us to stop this?

00:57:30.599 --> 00:57:35.699
Do you remember me favorably?

00:57:35.699 --> 00:57:36.699
Oh my God.

00:57:36.699 --> 00:57:46.920
We know you'll enjoy the convention.

00:57:46.920 --> 00:57:54.920
And it's my pleasure to announce that we'll conclude the convention on Sunday with a new original song.

00:57:54.920 --> 00:58:00.920
The song and lyrics are now available on jw.org.

00:58:00.920 --> 00:58:05.920
The governing body requested everyone in the congregation

00:58:05.920 --> 00:58:10.920
please practice the new song before going to the convention.

00:58:10.920 --> 00:58:15.920
If someone in your congregation needs help to download the song,

00:58:15.920 --> 00:58:19.920
please help them and practice with them.

00:58:19.920 --> 00:58:27.920
Then together we'll sing out with all of our heart to Jehovah's praise.

00:58:27.920 --> 00:58:31.920
That brings this month's program to an end.

00:58:31.920 --> 00:58:40.920
Please know that the governing body loves all of you brothers and sisters very much.

00:58:40.920 --> 00:58:45.920
From the world headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:58:45.920 --> 00:58:49.920
this is JW Broadcasting.
