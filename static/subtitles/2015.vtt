00:00:02.259 --> 00:00:07.139
and introduction to the Book of Lamentations.

00:00:07.139 --> 00:00:13.779
The prophet Jeremiah composed the Book of Lamentations shortly after witnessing the siege and destruction

00:00:13.779 --> 00:00:21.109
of Jerusalem by Babylon in 607 BCE.

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:27.510
Jeremiah expresses deep sadness over the catastrophe that befell Jerusalem.

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.549
The book is organized into five chapters or poems.

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:39.310
In chapter 1, the city of Jerusalem is described as a princess who is desolated by her enemies

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:45.310
and becomes an abandoned widow and slave on account of her many sins.

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:52.189
Chapter 2 reveals that it was Jehovah himself who brought about Jerusalem's destruction.

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:58.270
Those who pass by its ruined walls are amazed at the complete devastation.

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:04.310
In chapter 3, Jeremiah speaks of the desolate nation as an afflicted man who pleads with

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:08.549
Jehovah to remember his pitiable and homeless state.

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:15.430
However, Jeremiah shows a waiting attitude and expresses hope that Jehovah will in his

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.030
loyal love and mercy restore the nation.

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.750
Chapter 4 shifts attention to Jehovah's Temple.

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:31.140
Although it was once the glorious center of true worship, it was now devastated.

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:38.819
Jeremiah relates the horrific conditions, deprivation, famine, and death that existed in Jerusalem

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:42.920
during its final siege.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:48.159
Did you know The first four chapters are across the poems.

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:53.400
In each one's successive verses or groups of verses begin with the different letter of

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.620
the Hebrew alphabet.

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:02.739
Chapter 5 is written from the perspective of Jerusalem's former inhabitants who have lost

00:02:02.739 --> 00:02:04.980
their homes in freedom.

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:10.699
Jeremiah likens them to orphans without a father who humbly begged Jehovah for mercy

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:15.469
and salvation.

00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:22.590
As you consider the five poems of lamentations, notice how rebellion brings divine judgment.

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.949
How repentance leads to divine mercy.

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:30.349
And how sorrow will give way to rejoicing under the rule of God's kingdom.
