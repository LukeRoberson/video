00:00:04.299 --> 00:00:13.400
I went to a vocational school where I was able to fast track learning a trade.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.399
Unexpectedly, I finished at the top of my class.

00:00:16.399 --> 00:00:21.399
After that, my teachers and my classmates started to expect a lot more from me.

00:00:21.399 --> 00:00:25.399
They were saying, you're doing so well. You represent the school.

00:00:25.399 --> 00:00:28.399
You will have to work hard. You'll do great things.

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:33.399
You'll go far. They were constantly putting pressure on me to go for higher education

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:35.399
and to go to university.

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.399
There was this girl in high school who was my age.

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.399
She was very friendly. She always paid attention to me.

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.399
She was a nice person.

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:46.399
I also thought she was cute.

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:49.399
My classmates were like, go! Talk to her!

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:53.399
Or, hey, Isaac, do you know that she likes you?

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.399
And so, I wasn't sure what to do.

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.399
Of course, when I chose to go to that school, higher education wasn't the reason.

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:06.400
I wanted to fast track getting a trade and then starting a job so that I could earn my income.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.400
That's what I thought.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.400
It was a really difficult time for me.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.400
I remember praying to Jehovah in tears for hours.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.400
I didn't ask for advice.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.400
Didn't talk to friends or people I trusted about it, not even my parents.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:30.400
And little by little, I started to give into that pressure that I got because of this girl.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.400
In the end, we started to flirt with each other.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:40.629
We chatted and sent each other messages.

00:01:40.629 --> 00:01:44.629
When I prayed to Jehovah, I didn't feel completely comfortable.

00:01:44.629 --> 00:01:47.629
I thought, if I'm not doing what Jehovah is asking of me,

00:01:47.629 --> 00:01:50.629
if I'm not behaving how Jehovah expects me to behave,

00:01:50.629 --> 00:01:55.629
then how can I expect him to listen to my prayers or even consider them?

00:01:55.629 --> 00:01:58.629
My family never told me to go or not to go to university,

00:01:58.629 --> 00:02:01.629
but they reminded me of Jehovah's thinking.

00:02:01.629 --> 00:02:05.629
My dad read Proverbs 27 verse 11 to me.

00:02:05.629 --> 00:02:08.629
What I was doing was a barrier between me and Jehovah.

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:14.629
He helped me see that the decisions I make as a teenager affect Jehovah.

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:18.629
At that time, there were many videos, articles, and publications about this topic.

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:22.629
Reading experiences of those who went through similar things,

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:24.629
doing personal study on the subject,

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:28.629
and talking with spiritually mature brothers while in the ministry,

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:30.629
was very helpful for me.

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:34.629
Something that my parents did that helped me a lot

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:38.629
was that they used the book Young People Ask in Our Family Study,

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:41.629
and there's a chapter that talks about peer pressure.

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:50.629
Afterward, I was able to cope.

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:53.629
What helped me the most was something I heard at a circuit assembly.

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:58.629
The speaker said in his talk, yes, our young people have a lot of challenges right now.

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:01.629
And when it comes to higher education,

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:05.629
maybe their classmates and teachers are pressuring them, but you young people.

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:07.629
It felt like he spoke to me personally.

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:12.629
Your teacher or classmate might not even be part of your life in the future,

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:15.629
but if you want Jehovah always to be in your life,

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:18.629
then you need to make your decisions accordingly.

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:26.430
It was like a light went on in my head.

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.430
Now I was sure about what I needed to do.

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.430
I had to speak to her.

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.430
One day I prayed to Jehovah and got up the courage.

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.430
I told her that it couldn't continue with us.

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.430
Of course, explaining that to my classmates and to my teachers was a little hard.

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.430
I mean, it was difficult for them to understand.

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:54.430
Sure, I explained it, but they said, why would you do that?

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.430
For whoever is in the same situation that I was in,

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.430
the best thing to do is to talk to someone you trust.

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.430
Tell them how you feel and ask for help.

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:17.740
Our creator, Jehovah, is the one who thinks about me and loves me most.

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:21.740
He hasn't deprived me of anything good.

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:24.740
He always helps us and never leaves us.

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.740
I am so grateful to Jehovah.
