Many religions teach that God condemns the wicked to eternal torment after they die and hope that this fear of torment prevents them from doing bad.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:39.390
Does God really punish people after they die? The Bible reassures us that the dead are unconscious and that they know nothing at all.

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.390
If the dead are unconscious, they cannot suffer.

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:51.390
Does that mean God does not punish wicked people at all? No.

00:00:51.390 --> 00:01:02.289
God explained to the first human couple how they would be punished if they rebelled against him.

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:10.290
God said nothing about torment or hell. He simply said, you will certainly die.

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:18.290
And after being expelled from the Garden of Eden, that is exactly what happened to wicked Adam and Eve.

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.290
They passed away and became dust.

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:32.290
The Bible says that after death, one is no longer accountable for past mistakes because the one who has died has been acquitted from his sin.

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:38.290
But there is an even greater reason why a hell of torment could never exist.

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:43.290
The Bible tells us, God is love.

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:53.290
Would a loving God command that sinners be tormented? Not just for minutes, but for all eternity?

00:01:53.290 --> 00:02:04.819
Consider the following. In Bible times, God condemned the practice of sacrificing children in the fire to false gods.

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:12.520
He said that such a cruel deed never even entered his heart.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:20.520
We hate the idea of such brutality because we are made in the image of a loving, merciful God.

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:27.520
Clearly, we do not need to worry that our dead loved ones might be suffering punishment somewhere.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:32.520
The Bible tells us that they are at peace, at rest.

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:42.020
But why do good people die? What happens to them when they die?

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:47.590
What hope is there for our dead loved ones?

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:58.590
