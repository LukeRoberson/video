00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:06.969
Welcome! We're so happy you can join us for this month's program.

00:00:06.969 --> 00:00:12.970
I'm here with my good friend and co-host Leon Weaver. There he is! Leon, welcome!

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:14.970
David, I'm delighted to be here with you.

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.969
Now, I'd like to tell you a little something about Leon.

00:00:18.969 --> 00:00:24.969
When I was invited into Bethel in 1990, I was assigned to the service department.

00:00:24.969 --> 00:00:27.969
And Leon was one of the overseers.

00:00:27.969 --> 00:00:31.969
The service department at times we had to deal with some very difficult matters.

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:34.969
And sometimes you needed advice.

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:38.969
And I could always rely on Leon to help me out.

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:46.969
I'd go into his office, he'd set aside whatever it was he was working on, he'd listen, and then he'd give his input.

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:53.969
I really appreciated the experience I acquired in the service department and Leon was certainly part of it.

00:00:54.969 --> 00:01:00.969
So this is one reason why I have love and respect for that brother.

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:04.969
Now, Leon, what can we look forward to in this month's program?

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:11.969
Many years ago, Elizabeth gave up a prestigious career to do more for Jehovah.

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:15.969
How did her decision change the course of her life?

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:19.969
And will debut a fascinating new series?

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:26.969
It will reveal aspects of our their credit history you may not be familiar with.

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:30.969
That sounds very interesting. Don't go away.

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:55.739
This is JW Broadcasting for November 2021.

00:01:55.739 --> 00:02:01.739
Through his Prophet Isaiah, Jehovah made a wonderful promise for this being fulfilled today.

00:02:01.739 --> 00:02:07.739
We can read about it at Isaiah 60 and verse 17.

00:02:07.739 --> 00:02:10.740
Instead of the copper, I will bring in gold.

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.740
And instead of the iron, I will bring in silver.

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.740
Instead of the wood, copper, and instead of the stones, iron.

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:26.740
And I will appoint peace as your overseers and righteousness as your task assigners.

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:33.740
And all this reference to overseers and task assigners, that sounds like organization, doesn't it?

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.740
So what is Jehovah telling us?

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:42.740
He's saying that we can expect to see organizational arrangements get better and better.

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:50.740
Well, if you've been associated with the truth for a while, I'm sure you'll agree that Isaiah's prophecy is being fulfilled today.

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:58.740
So for this broadcast, I thought we'd review some of the improvements we've seen just since World War II.

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.740
That's the period most of us are familiar with.

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:05.740
Now some of you will be hearing about these things for the first time.

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:11.740
Others will live live through it all. And for them, it'll bring back fond memories.

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:19.990
So let's go back. It'll be fun. I call this part, do you remember when?

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:27.990
Before World War II. And for a number of years after that, many congregations didn't have a kingdom hall of their own.

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:33.990
And they were actually encouraged to meet in private homes or in rented facilities.

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:39.990
The thinking was that if you were in a rented facility or a private home, you had more flexibility.

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:44.990
You could move the meeting place from one place to the other very easily.

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:50.990
But there were problems or a drawbacks. Sometimes the space would be shared with other organizations.

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:58.990
So you couldn't leave your literature, magazine, speaker stand, and maybe even a sound system in the hall at the end of the meeting.

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:03.990
When the meeting was over, you'd have to pack it all up and take it away.

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:06.990
But that's not all.

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:14.990
Sometimes you had to arrive very early and click the place up after a particularly rowdy group of people had used it.

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:18.990
And if there were cigar smokers in that group, you were in trouble.

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:23.990
It was very difficult to air the place out in time for the meeting.

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:28.990
Now remember, in those days, people could smoke in a private hall.

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:34.990
And you could smoke in an airplane. They could smoke almost anywhere. So this was a real problem for us.

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:42.990
There were other problems. Before we had a kingdom hall in my hometown, the congregation met in a rented facility.

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:46.990
Now in October, the place was decorated for Halloween.

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:52.990
And in December, there was a great big Christmas tree on the platform. We couldn't move it.

00:04:52.990 --> 00:05:00.990
And now this was in Canada. And portraits of the king and queen of England, as well as the British flag, were permanent fixtures in the hall.

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:04.990
You couldn't remove any of it for the meeting.

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:12.990
Yet, to their credit, many interested persons attended our meetings. And to them, it wasn't the meeting place that was important.

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:16.990
It was what they were learning there that counted.

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:23.990
Speaking of our meeting places, at first congregations were on their own when it came to building them.

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:35.990
Now at times, the most a congregation could afford was to purchase the land. And sometimes, that land would sit there for years, because it would take years to get the money together to build the hall.

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:42.990
And then, once they had the money together, were there enough brothers who could take the lead in the construction?

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:49.990
Sometimes on a weekend, you see just one or two brothers working away at the side of the new hall.

00:05:49.990 --> 00:06:04.990
It had to love them for their perseverance. Nowadays, our kingdom hall construction is supervised by the LDCs with lots of qualified volunteers and practical kingdom halls can be constructed in a short period of time.

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:14.990
What about the meetings? For years, the ministry school, service meeting, congregation book study, and watchtower study were all about an hour at length.

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:28.990
So were the public talks when we had them. Not first, a public talk wasn't scheduled every week. It would be a series of four or eight talks if you could schedule that many speakers.

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:32.990
And then for a while, the congregation wouldn't have a public talk.

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:43.990
What was that? Remember, the Theocratic ministry school didn't get underway until 1943, and it took time for the brothers to develop the skills to deliver an hour talk.

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:49.990
But in time, they were delivering excellent public talks.

00:06:49.990 --> 00:07:05.009
And do you remember when we had individual handbills for each public talk, with the name of the speaker printed on them? Until 1959, only brothers were enrolled in the school.

00:07:05.009 --> 00:07:13.009
For some years, during the first few minutes of the school, there was a rule call. And the names of all the brothers enrolled in the school were read out.

00:07:14.009 --> 00:07:23.009
Now, when your name was read out, you were to answer present. A few rebels would say, here, but you were supposed to say present.

00:07:23.009 --> 00:07:33.009
Now, initially, according to the instructions, if anyone was deliberately and habitually absent over a period of time, he was dropped from the school.

00:07:33.009 --> 00:07:37.009
Later, that was discontinued.

00:07:37.009 --> 00:07:51.009
Now, the rule call arrangement got me into a bit of trouble. You see, in our congregation, when the role was being called each week, I noticed that there were a few young brothers who were just a little bit older than I was, who would answer present.

00:07:51.009 --> 00:07:58.009
So one night, after the school, I asked the school servant if I could have my name read out at the next meeting.

00:07:58.009 --> 00:08:10.009
He warmly commended me, and sure enough, I got my name read out the following week. Everyone congratulated me after the meeting. Couldn't understand why. I only said present.

00:08:10.009 --> 00:08:20.009
Problem was, I didn't know that when you got your name read out, you were agreeing to give a talk. I thought I was just signing up to have my name read out.

00:08:20.009 --> 00:08:32.009
Well, a couple of months later, on April 8, 1953, I delivered my first eight-minute talk on the theme, proclaiming the world's doom.

00:08:32.009 --> 00:08:40.009
Now, why an eight-minute talk? Well, we didn't have Bible readings yet. So, when you were on the school, you were giving an eight-minute talk.

00:08:40.009 --> 00:08:48.009
Well, today, we make sure everyone understands what's involved in being a student in the midweek meeting.

00:08:48.009 --> 00:08:57.009
In 1950, we received the New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures in English, and we were encouraged to bring it to the meetings.

00:08:57.009 --> 00:09:06.009
So, for the Hebrew Scriptures, you'd have the American Standard Version or the King James Version, mostly the American Standard Version because it had Jehovah's name.

00:09:06.009 --> 00:09:16.009
So, you'd have two Bibles to bring to the meeting. There's the one for the Hebrew Scriptures, and then the New World Translation for the Greek Scriptures. Two Bibles, it wasn't too bad.

00:09:16.009 --> 00:09:30.009
But later, the New World Translation of the Hebrew Scriptures was released in installments. So, you'd get a volume every year or two, and as we received each new volume, we were encouraged to bring it to the meeting.

00:09:30.009 --> 00:09:46.009
How in time, those volumes started to pile up. So that by 1960, you might have volumes one through five of the Hebrew Scriptures, and the Greek Scriptures, and your regular study aids, and we had thick study aids in those days.

00:09:46.009 --> 00:09:57.009
We had big briefcases and strong backs in those days. We were really happy to get the complete New World Translation in just one volume in 1961.

00:09:57.009 --> 00:10:11.179
Now, let's say a word about music. That's something that's near and dear to my heart. For many years, it was left up to the local servants to decide which songs the congregation would sing at the meeting.

00:10:11.179 --> 00:10:18.179
So, the chairman of a particular meeting would select the songs, but his choice wasn't always final.

00:10:18.179 --> 00:10:30.179
Many Kingdom Halls had a piano or some other instrument to accompany the singing, but often the musician couldn't play all the songs in the book. So, we'd have to sing the songs he could play.

00:10:30.179 --> 00:10:38.179
We got to know those few songs really well, but those humble musicians did their best to accompany our singing.

00:10:39.179 --> 00:10:47.179
As a result of all this, the words to those songs we sang nearly 70 years ago still come readily to mind.

00:10:47.179 --> 00:10:52.460
Do you remember the written review? Maybe you don't.

00:10:52.460 --> 00:11:00.460
Congregations periodically had a written review of material Edmund covered in the ministry school over the previous weeks.

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:16.460
Now, we had a half hour to answer about 25 questions, but then when the half hour was up, we would write our name on the paper, hand it into the school servant, and he would take all the papers home to grade them.

00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:28.460
Now, if there were 25 questions, you'd get four points a piece for each correct answer, a hundred points total, and then a week later, he'd return the papers to us at the meeting.

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:36.460
Now, in the early years of the arrangement, I remember well. He'd announced the highest and lowest grade to the congregation.

00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:41.460
Now, thankfully, he didn't mention the names of the one who got the highest and lowest score.

00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:46.460
Later, that arrangement to announce the highest and lowest grade was discontinued.

00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:53.460
Do you remember when circuit assemblies began on Friday evening and continued through Sunday afternoon?

00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:58.460
A full program was presented Saturday afternoon and evening.

00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:01.460
There was never a dull moment on Saturday night.

00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:07.779
There were lively demonstrations that kept our interest right up to the end of the program.

00:12:07.779 --> 00:12:11.779
Sometimes, the sets were very elaborate.

00:12:11.779 --> 00:12:16.779
For example, suppose a publisher was demonstrating a presentation from door to door.

00:12:16.779 --> 00:12:20.779
Not today, we just imagine there was a door.

00:12:20.779 --> 00:12:30.779
But back then, at the circuit assembly, there might be a frame with a painted door on the stage and maybe even a doorbell for the publisher to ring.

00:12:30.779 --> 00:12:37.779
Now, if the householder was supposed to be interested, you knew it, because the house number was 777.

00:12:37.779 --> 00:12:45.779
And if the householder was going to be opposed, you knew that as well, because the house number would be 666.

00:12:45.779 --> 00:12:52.779
Now, on one program I remember, the publisher knocks on the door and a brother dressed as a priest answers.

00:12:52.779 --> 00:12:55.779
He puts up a real argument about the Trinity.

00:12:55.779 --> 00:13:02.779
Talk about visual aids, but you never forgot what you saw and heard.

00:13:02.779 --> 00:13:09.779
And do you remember when each congregation had a congregation servant and up to seven other servants?

00:13:09.779 --> 00:13:21.779
The assistant congregation servant, the Bible study servant, the account servant, the watchtower study servant, the magazine territory servant, the literature servant, and the ministry school servant.

00:13:21.779 --> 00:13:29.779
Now, at that time, apart from book study conductors, you couldn't have more than eight servants in the congregation.

00:13:29.779 --> 00:13:36.779
So, unless someone moved, a young man had no chance of becoming a servant.

00:13:36.779 --> 00:13:40.779
So, how could a young man reach out for more responsibility?

00:13:40.779 --> 00:13:46.779
And, how would the prophecy recorded at Micah 5.5 ever be fulfilled?

00:13:46.779 --> 00:13:55.779
There, Jehovah promised, we will raise up against him seven shepherds, yes, eight princes of mankind.

00:13:55.779 --> 00:14:05.779
Well, seven represents completeness, so eight princes, I would indicate that there would be more than enough men in the congregations to provide theocratic direction.

00:14:06.779 --> 00:14:12.779
But how could that be when there was basically a limit of eight servants for congregation?

00:14:12.779 --> 00:14:16.779
The answer came in 1971.

00:14:16.779 --> 00:14:28.779
We were thrilled when we understood that each congregation has a body of elders, and there is no set number of elders or ministerial servants, as many as are qualified can be appointed.

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:39.120
Now, when I was baptized 66 years ago, it didn't have to be approved for baptism by the congregation.

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:46.120
And the only questions asked of baptism candidates were the two they answered at the conclusion of the baptism talk.

00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:57.120
That led to a few strange situations, on a few occasions, much of the surprise of the servants, someone would rush up to the front of the hall at the end of the baptism talk,

00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:02.120
answer the two questions, and get baptized.

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:05.120
Something more was needed.

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:12.120
Assurance that the individual really knew what he was doing, and especially that he was living in harmony with scriptural principles.

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:24.120
So, in 1967, questions were provided, so that the responsible brothers could be assured that each candidate was truly qualified for baptism.

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:33.120
Those questions have been refined over the years, and today we go over some 60 questions with baptism candidates.

00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:37.120
The copper has turned to gold.

00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:41.120
Do you remember when there were very few pictures in our publications?

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:46.120
And the few we had, usually in black and white, are only two colors.

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:52.120
Today, our spiritual food is served in attractive publications in full color.

00:15:52.120 --> 00:16:04.879
Now, those of us who have served in four language congregations will also remember when a new publication in English might not be available in another language for several years.

00:16:04.879 --> 00:16:08.879
Study articles, trailed by several months.

00:16:08.879 --> 00:16:13.879
That's before it became possible for the branches to do simultaneous printing.

00:16:13.879 --> 00:16:15.879
So, here's how it worked.

00:16:15.879 --> 00:16:21.879
Material in English would be mailed to the branches, regular mail, for translation.

00:16:21.879 --> 00:16:30.879
And if the translators had a question about the meaning of a sentence in English, they would use regular mail to send their question to headquarters.

00:16:30.879 --> 00:16:34.879
In time, headquarters would answer back by regular mail.

00:16:34.879 --> 00:16:41.879
And this back and forth, it could take quite a while, and in some countries, mail service was poor.

00:16:41.879 --> 00:16:50.879
Now, today, thanks to special computer programs our brothers have developed and the ability to communicate electronically and some other factors,

00:16:50.879 --> 00:16:55.879
we're able to release most language editions simultaneously with the English.

00:16:55.879 --> 00:16:59.879
What an improvement.

00:16:59.879 --> 00:17:08.880
Now, speaking of our literature, do you realize that it's been some 31 years since the decision was made that in the United States,

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:12.880
we'd no longer ask for a contribution for our literature?

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:15.880
Later, the arrangement was extended worldwide.

00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:20.880
That's been a real blessing for our brothers.

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:31.880
For example, when we were asking for contributions for literature, some brothers in Africa and other places couldn't afford to have a watchtower for every member of the family.

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:35.880
They were just too poor.

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:38.880
And what about bomb books?

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:40.880
Tell you an experience.

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:47.880
In one African country, a missionary noticed that a young brother quoted a wide variety of scriptures in his comments.

00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:54.880
And he got curious. One day he asked the young brother, how did you come to know so many scriptures?

00:17:54.880 --> 00:18:00.880
The brother replied, it's the reasoning book. I read it every chance I get.

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:05.880
The missionary asked him, what do you mean you read it every chance you get?

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:11.880
Well, he replied, I don't have a reasoning book myself. I could never afford one.

00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:16.880
But I know a sister who has one. And she lets me borrow it from time to time.

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:20.880
I read it every chance I get.

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:23.880
Well, you can imagine.

00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:29.880
Missionary went out and bought him a reasoning book and a new world translation for good measure.

00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:34.880
It was a great investment. The young brother was later called into Bethel.

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:38.880
And where do you think he was assigned to the literature department?

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:49.380
The brothers knew he appreciated the literature so much that he had made sure the congregations had the literature they needed.

00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:54.380
Well, looking back, we can see that the arrangements back then served a purpose.

00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:57.380
They were like fine copper.

00:18:57.380 --> 00:19:00.380
We do not look down on them.

00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:05.380
Rather, we take the view expressed at Zechariah 4 verse 10.

00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:10.380
Who has despised the day of small beginnings?

00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:14.380
There was those taking the lead to saw a better way of doing things.

00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:19.380
They didn't hesitate to make adjustments. That's very faith strengthening.

00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:23.380
And the best is yet to come.

00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:29.630
As I mentioned in the beginning, this may be the first time that some of you have heard about these things.

00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:35.630
Why not ask someone who has been in the truth for many years, what it was like when he was new in the truth?

00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:40.630
That could lead to a very stimulating discussion.

00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:45.630
Thank you for those historical insights, David.

00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:50.630
When you think about how much has changed just in our lifetimes,

00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:57.630
you really see how Jehovah keeps improving his organization.

00:19:57.630 --> 00:20:05.630
Next, we have a great example of someone who has seen all of the changes we've talked about,

00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:09.630
and more, John Mills.

00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:16.630
Let's see how he has faithfully served Jehovah through multiple assignments and challenges.

00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:25.339
I was raised with three sisters and my nun was in the truth.

00:20:27.589 --> 00:20:33.589
I remember sitting on the sofa and just talking about spiritual things with my mom.

00:20:33.589 --> 00:20:43.130
And she taught us to appreciate any assignment that we had to see it as something very special.

00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:47.779
Pioneering was my life.

00:20:47.779 --> 00:20:52.779
Gilead to me was a way to give to others, to be very busy in service.

00:20:52.779 --> 00:20:56.779
I pray to Jehovah I said I really want to go to Gilead.

00:20:56.779 --> 00:21:02.779
But if it's possible to have a wife too, and I just thought,

00:21:02.779 --> 00:21:05.779
boy, are you pushy?

00:21:05.779 --> 00:21:10.779
And so, but Jehovah gave me that.

00:21:10.779 --> 00:21:16.779
I went to Gilead and to my amazement.

00:21:16.779 --> 00:21:22.779
This is the most lovely spiritual system.

00:21:23.779 --> 00:21:35.740
Students in the same class, Lois, I met her and was able to marry her one week after Gilead.

00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:42.740
Arriving has a newlywed couple in a missionary home with seven other people.

00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:46.740
It was quite daunting, but we didn't let that face us.

00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:49.740
We were on a honeymoon.

00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:52.740
Columbia was a paradise, spiritually.

00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:55.740
We loved it so much.

00:21:55.740 --> 00:22:00.369
This was the kind of life we wanted.

00:22:00.369 --> 00:22:04.369
Lois was a great teacher in the ministry.

00:22:04.369 --> 00:22:06.369
I always enjoyed working with her.

00:22:06.369 --> 00:22:11.740
She was actually a great support for me.

00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:14.740
Obviously, Columbia had its risks.

00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:20.740
I remember in the mornings, sometimes it got to the point where I would look at Lois

00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:22.740
and she would look at me and we'd just say,

00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:25.740
if I don't see you, see in the paradise, you know.

00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:31.559
Columbia became our home.

00:22:31.559 --> 00:22:37.559
We traveled the length and breadth of the country and our different assignments.

00:22:37.559 --> 00:22:45.559
We'd been over 20 years in Columbia when it became very evident that Lois's mom would need our care.

00:22:45.559 --> 00:22:52.339
This, of course, would mean leaving her assignment.

00:22:52.339 --> 00:22:56.339
It almost tore my heart apart to leave Columbia.

00:22:57.339 --> 00:23:06.869
I felt I was abandoning so many privileges and my treasured assignment.

00:23:06.869 --> 00:23:15.869
In the USA, we were working as a team and I could see Lois really organized

00:23:15.869 --> 00:23:19.869
making the best of the situation.

00:23:19.869 --> 00:23:27.869
Helping her mom was really the source in a way of her deep joy.

00:23:27.869 --> 00:23:32.869
Helping others was just a way of life to Lois.

00:23:32.869 --> 00:23:40.869
It doesn't matter what privilege you have, what responsibility,

00:23:40.869 --> 00:23:45.869
the true happiness is always found in giving.

00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:51.630
Really, Lois got very ill.

00:23:51.630 --> 00:23:56.630
Lois never cried about her illness or felt sorry for herself.

00:23:56.630 --> 00:24:08.230
She always was focused on others and would give herself even within the pain of illness.

00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:16.230
Now that Lois has passed many times, think of her example.

00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:21.230
It just motivates me to carry on.

00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:29.230
Here at the Central America branch, I am surrounded by such a loving family.

00:24:29.230 --> 00:24:38.230
I resolved when I went through this situation with losing my wife to find others

00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:47.230
that were in similar situations, maybe sit down for a coffee,

00:24:47.230 --> 00:24:55.230
just that fellow feeling, just being able to show interest and encourage another person

00:24:55.230 --> 00:25:09.460
is a great joy that I personally find one of the most helpful things to endure trials.

00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:19.460
John's life of Faithful Service reminds me of the truth found at 2 Corinthians 1, verse 3 and 4.

00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:27.460
Jehovah comforts us in all our trials so that we may be able to comfort others

00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:34.460
and any sort of trial with the comfort that we receive from God.

00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:42.220
Have you ever wondered why we sing at our meetings

00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:47.220
or why we attend conventions usually in the summer?

00:25:49.470 --> 00:25:57.470
Many who are young in years or new in the truth may not be familiar with certain aspects of our history

00:25:57.470 --> 00:26:07.470
yet this rich spiritual history is your heritage and we want you to become acquainted with it.

00:26:07.470 --> 00:26:19.470
So the governing body has approved the development of a new series, our history in motion.

00:26:19.470 --> 00:26:28.470
Each segment will look at an aspect of our worship through time similar to what David shared with us earlier.

00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:36.470
The series will help us see that our worship is rooted not in tradition or custom

00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:41.470
but in the truth found in God's word.

00:26:41.470 --> 00:26:54.380
Now for our first episode, it looks at the history of singing praises to Jehovah.

00:26:54.380 --> 00:27:03.380
It was made in secret hidden in the lining of a jacket and then smuggled out of the country.

00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:12.380
What was it? A recording of brothers and sisters in Siberia singing Kingdom songs.

00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:20.380
They sent it from one side of the earth to the other to be played at the 1958 International Convention in New York

00:27:20.380 --> 00:27:26.380
for an audience of more than 250,000 people.

00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:31.380
Why is singing so important to Jehovah's Witnesses?

00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:36.380
Let's find out in this episode of our history in motion.

00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:54.529
Jehovah's worshipers have long praised him with song but how did singing become a part of our modern day worship?

00:27:54.529 --> 00:27:59.529
The story begins more than 150 years ago.

00:27:59.529 --> 00:28:05.529
The year is about 1869 in Allegheny, Pennsylvania, USA.

00:28:06.529 --> 00:28:11.529
Charles Tay's Russell is a young man searching for scriptural truth.

00:28:11.529 --> 00:28:20.529
One evening he's walking along and hears something, singing coming from a religious meeting being held in a basement.

00:28:20.529 --> 00:28:27.529
He goes in and what he hears sparks a fire for Bible study like never before.

00:28:27.529 --> 00:28:33.529
Later, Russell and his associates make music's role in pure worship clear

00:28:33.529 --> 00:28:37.529
as they rediscover Bible truth.

00:28:37.529 --> 00:28:49.529
Charles Tay's Russell may have come to appreciate the power of music to stir emotions from a music business his father owned for a period of time.

00:28:49.529 --> 00:28:59.529
He believed that the singing of the truth is a good way to get it into the heads and hearts of God's people.

00:29:00.529 --> 00:29:10.529
The first issue of Zion's Watchtower published in July of 1879 announced a song book, The First of Many to Come.

00:29:10.529 --> 00:29:13.529
It was called Songs of the Bride.

00:29:13.529 --> 00:29:19.529
It contained 144 hymns or religious songs of praise.

00:29:19.529 --> 00:29:23.529
The Bible students sang at their meetings and assemblies.

00:29:23.529 --> 00:29:28.529
What was it like to sing these songs back in the early 1900s?

00:29:28.529 --> 00:29:33.529
Imagine you're at one of Charles Tay's Russell's lectures.

00:29:33.529 --> 00:29:37.529
As you walk in, you're handed a small sheet of paper.

00:29:37.529 --> 00:29:40.529
You look for a seat, but it's packed.

00:29:40.529 --> 00:29:47.529
As the crowd quiets down, they announce that the meeting will start with the song and prayer.

00:29:47.529 --> 00:29:54.529
In a church you expect to find a hymn book in your pew, but this is a rented hall.

00:29:54.529 --> 00:29:59.529
Then you realize that the paper you were handed has the song lyrics,

00:29:59.529 --> 00:30:05.529
and it also has a place to leave your name and address if you'd like a Bible study.

00:30:05.529 --> 00:30:10.529
So when the audience starts to sing, you join in.

00:30:10.529 --> 00:30:13.529
What did songs sound like back then?

00:30:13.529 --> 00:30:18.529
Let's listen to a song we sang for over eight decades.

00:30:18.529 --> 00:30:23.529
Here's a recording from 1916.

00:30:23.529 --> 00:30:33.029
That's a little different than how our song sound today.

00:30:33.029 --> 00:30:41.029
Compare different versions of this song and you'll notice the lyrics and theme changed over the years.

00:30:41.029 --> 00:30:59.200
Here's a version of All Hail by the Watchtower male quartet in 1935.

00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:05.200
In our first song book, the song was called All Hail the Power of Jesus Name,

00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:11.200
which was about, well, the power of Jesus' name was zero mention of Jehovah.

00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:18.200
You see, many songs prior to this were adapted from existing church hymns.

00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:22.200
Now here's the same song in 1950.

00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:38.059
Instead of the lyrics over emphasizing Jesus' name, the lyrics refer to making known God's will and mentions Jehovah by name.

00:31:38.059 --> 00:31:40.059
Why all the changes?

00:31:40.059 --> 00:31:46.059
Because our songs reflect our current understanding of scriptural truth.

00:31:46.059 --> 00:31:51.059
As the light gets brighter, we understand the truth more clearly.

00:31:51.059 --> 00:31:53.059
So the songs change.

00:31:53.059 --> 00:32:01.059
Our first song book explained the goal to publish songs free from objectionable theology.

00:32:01.059 --> 00:32:05.059
And it's been the case ever since.

00:32:05.059 --> 00:32:10.059
We don't hold on to songs for tradition or nostalgia.

00:32:10.059 --> 00:32:15.059
We sing it because it's the truth.

00:32:15.059 --> 00:32:20.059
From the 1928 song book onward, there was a big shift.

00:32:20.059 --> 00:32:23.059
Many songs were written by our brothers and sisters.

00:32:23.059 --> 00:32:30.059
They put more emphasis on Jehovah's name, attributes, and kingdom.

00:32:30.059 --> 00:32:35.059
You can even tell by the title, Songs of Praise to Jehovah.

00:32:35.059 --> 00:32:40.059
Some of the songs might even sound familiar, like this one.

00:32:40.059 --> 00:32:58.390
Are your parents in the truth, your grandparents, even your great-grandparents?

00:32:58.390 --> 00:33:04.390
If so, they sang the same song as you at their meetings and assemblies.

00:33:04.390 --> 00:33:07.390
That's a real legacy.

00:33:08.390 --> 00:33:11.390
Let's fast forward to the 1940s.

00:33:11.390 --> 00:33:14.390
Some of our brothers were imprisoned for their faith.

00:33:14.390 --> 00:33:18.390
The world was at war and needed good news.

00:33:18.390 --> 00:33:21.390
So we intensified our preaching and teaching work.

00:33:21.390 --> 00:33:27.390
This is when the Watchtower Bible School of Gillian and theocratic ministry school started.

00:33:27.390 --> 00:33:32.390
And it's also when singing was reintroduced at our meetings.

00:33:34.769 --> 00:33:35.769
Wait a minute.

00:33:35.769 --> 00:33:37.769
Reintroduced?

00:33:37.769 --> 00:33:41.769
That means we stop singing at meetings.

00:33:41.769 --> 00:33:57.700
When? Find out in the next episode of our history in motion.

00:33:57.700 --> 00:34:01.700
Well, that's a cliffhanger.

00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:07.700
Would you like to know why we stopped singing for a time?

00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:11.699
You'll want to watch the second part of this video.

00:34:11.699 --> 00:34:21.699
It will be posted soon on JW.org and look for a future episode of our history in motion.

00:34:21.699 --> 00:34:31.400
Many years ago, a Wake magazine published a story of Elizabeth Balneve.

00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:38.400
Elizabeth explains why she made a major career decision.

00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:42.400
How did that decision affect her life?

00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:53.139
Let's find out in this episode of Where Are They Now?

00:34:53.139 --> 00:34:59.139
As a child, I dreamed of becoming a ballerina.

00:34:59.139 --> 00:35:02.139
I trained as a ballet dancer from childhood.

00:35:02.139 --> 00:35:06.139
I was taught to give complete obedience to the artistic director,

00:35:06.139 --> 00:35:09.139
absolute loyalty to the dance company,

00:35:09.139 --> 00:35:13.139
and to put ballet before everything else in my life.

00:35:13.139 --> 00:35:20.619
I finally realized there's no way to get ahead in this world without compromise.

00:35:20.619 --> 00:35:31.380
It just can't be done. Such a life is empty and unsatisfying.

00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:34.380
Problem is, once you get into that,

00:35:34.380 --> 00:35:38.380
because you get lulled in by that glimmer and glitz,

00:35:38.380 --> 00:35:43.380
now down the road when you finally see the trap and what you got into,

00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:45.380
it's very hard to get out.

00:35:45.380 --> 00:35:48.380
And I always tell young people, you know,

00:35:48.380 --> 00:35:52.380
it doesn't matter how good everything seems, it doesn't matter how great,

00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:56.380
there's always a string attached, always.

00:35:56.380 --> 00:36:00.380
And then one day, you're going to wake up and it's a rope.

00:36:00.380 --> 00:36:03.380
And you can't cut a rope that easily.

00:36:03.380 --> 00:36:08.380
Meaning you can't get out of this situation once the Satan has you trapped in it.

00:36:08.380 --> 00:36:11.380
And it happens without you even realizing it.

00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:14.380
Ballet is discipline.

00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:21.380
And I had to figure out a way to take that skill and transfer it into my everyday life.

00:36:21.380 --> 00:36:23.380
Took some time, but I finally figured it out,

00:36:23.380 --> 00:36:25.380
because it's not a waste, it's good.

00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:29.380
But what I had to learn was to get out of my comfort zone.

00:36:29.380 --> 00:36:33.789
We were in Bethel until 1987.

00:36:33.789 --> 00:36:38.789
Jack had a job lined up when we left Bethel, and that was good.

00:36:38.789 --> 00:36:43.789
I couldn't get a job because of my physical health issues.

00:36:43.789 --> 00:36:46.789
So I probably was in bed about five months.

00:36:46.789 --> 00:36:49.789
Eventually, I started feeling better.

00:36:49.789 --> 00:36:52.789
And that's when I realized how bad the medical bills were getting.

00:36:52.789 --> 00:36:57.789
I just dragged myself out of bed and went and looked for a part-time job.

00:36:57.789 --> 00:37:01.789
Obviously, through all of this, Jack and I just kept praying we knew

00:37:01.789 --> 00:37:04.789
Jehovah would take care of us, no question about that.

00:37:04.789 --> 00:37:08.789
Eventually, I did get a job at a law firm.

00:37:08.789 --> 00:37:09.789
It was a good job.

00:37:09.789 --> 00:37:11.789
I actually lasted there 30 years.

00:37:11.789 --> 00:37:14.789
Absolutely, Jehovah blessed me.

00:37:14.789 --> 00:37:17.789
And I believe what he was blessing were my efforts.

00:37:17.789 --> 00:37:21.789
I didn't quit and are refused to compromise.

00:37:21.789 --> 00:37:25.789
When I started seeing that I was really learning this new skill

00:37:25.789 --> 00:37:28.789
and I was getting good at it, that's when I sat down and I said,

00:37:28.789 --> 00:37:30.789
Jehovah, I have this new skill.

00:37:30.789 --> 00:37:33.789
I want to be able to use it for you.

00:37:33.789 --> 00:37:36.789
One thing led to another and I became a commuter Bethelite

00:37:36.789 --> 00:37:38.789
for the legal department.

00:37:38.789 --> 00:37:41.789
I'd say about 11 years after I had left Bethel,

00:37:41.789 --> 00:37:43.789
I was working all of a sudden.

00:37:43.789 --> 00:37:44.789
I got sick again.

00:37:44.789 --> 00:37:45.789
Same thing.

00:37:45.789 --> 00:37:47.789
Complete rapid loss of weight.

00:37:47.789 --> 00:37:49.789
All the weakness came back.

00:37:49.789 --> 00:37:53.789
I was eventually diagnosed as having celiac disease.

00:37:53.789 --> 00:37:57.789
So once I changed my diet, I just started getting better or better.

00:37:57.789 --> 00:38:00.789
I stayed with the law firm until 2014.

00:38:00.789 --> 00:38:04.789
Then my husband and I retired and moved to another part of the country.

00:38:04.789 --> 00:38:08.789
And now, currently, I'm a remote Bethel consultant.

00:38:08.789 --> 00:38:11.789
Slave for the world really are a slave.

00:38:11.789 --> 00:38:14.789
If you slave for Jehovah, in my opinion,

00:38:14.789 --> 00:38:16.789
you're not slaving at all.

00:38:16.789 --> 00:38:20.789
You couldn't have a better partnership than you and Jehovah.

00:38:20.789 --> 00:38:23.789
And that's how I view it.

00:38:23.789 --> 00:38:26.789
And you're never going to experience Jehovah to the full,

00:38:26.789 --> 00:38:29.789
unless you put yourself out there for him to use.

00:38:29.789 --> 00:38:35.789
I've had a wonderful life of extraordinary spiritual privileges.

00:38:35.789 --> 00:38:39.789
There's no career in the world that is ever going to come close to that.

00:38:39.789 --> 00:38:55.500
Wouldn't you say that resilience is one of the qualities that has helped Elizabeth?

00:38:55.500 --> 00:39:01.500
What can each of us do to be more resilient?

00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:06.500
Notice three practical suggestions in this morning worship presented

00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:09.500
by Brother Gaius Glockanton.

00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:15.739
Mary kept listening to what Jesus was saying.

00:39:15.739 --> 00:39:17.739
How commendable.

00:39:17.739 --> 00:39:21.739
She said the right priorities and is a good example for us.

00:39:21.739 --> 00:39:26.739
Martha, her sister, however, received loving correction from Jesus

00:39:26.739 --> 00:39:29.739
as our printed comment puts it.

00:39:29.739 --> 00:39:34.739
Now, let us today put ourselves in the shoes of Martha for a moment.

00:39:34.739 --> 00:39:38.739
She showed great interest in supporting Jesus

00:39:38.739 --> 00:39:44.739
by providing him a base during his ministry in a difficult area of Judea.

00:39:44.739 --> 00:39:52.739
Now, this time Mary and Martha were probably working together to prepare things for Jesus.

00:39:52.739 --> 00:39:57.739
But after Jesus arrived, Mary stopped helping as our text indicates.

00:39:57.739 --> 00:40:00.739
How did Martha feel about it?

00:40:00.739 --> 00:40:03.739
Now, she had to care for everything herself.

00:40:03.739 --> 00:40:09.739
Can we imagine the tension rising within Martha's heart,

00:40:09.739 --> 00:40:12.739
the stress level increased,

00:40:12.739 --> 00:40:17.739
and her dear sister sits and listens to Jesus?

00:40:17.739 --> 00:40:23.739
So she asked Jesus to correct Mary to order her back to work.

00:40:23.739 --> 00:40:29.739
But to her surprise, she, Martha, received counsel from Jesus.

00:40:29.739 --> 00:40:32.739
How would we feel in such a situation?

00:40:32.739 --> 00:40:35.739
We are doing something well-intentioned.

00:40:35.739 --> 00:40:39.739
And yet, instead of commendation, we receive counsel.

00:40:39.739 --> 00:40:43.739
Maybe our eyes fill with tears.

00:40:43.739 --> 00:40:45.739
We feel the pain on our chest.

00:40:45.739 --> 00:40:49.739
We might think we can't breathe anymore.

00:40:49.739 --> 00:40:53.739
And did Martha think for a moment, replying to Jesus, saying,

00:40:53.739 --> 00:40:55.739
this is not fair.

00:40:55.739 --> 00:40:57.739
I am doing everything to support you.

00:40:57.739 --> 00:41:00.739
You know, from now on, I am listening to,

00:41:00.739 --> 00:41:07.880
and I am curious to find out who prepares the meals for you.

00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:12.880
Of course, we don't know what Martha thought and said.

00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:16.880
But what we do know, as our printed comment puts it,

00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:20.880
she took to heart Jesus' loving correction.

00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:26.880
What can help us to overcome such a painful moment and progress?

00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:31.880
The term often used in this connection is resilience.

00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:35.880
People who are resilient are able to recover easily and quickly

00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:39.880
from unpleasant and damaging events.

00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:45.880
It is like the ability of this piece of metal to tolerate pressure

00:41:45.880 --> 00:41:50.880
and get back to its original form.

00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:54.880
Let us therefore look at three factors that make us resilient

00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:59.880
and different from those who easily give up and surrender.

00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:06.880
Now, the first factor is facing reality, facing reality.

00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:10.880
Let us please open to Proverbs chapter 28.

00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:15.880
The question we are asking ourselves in a difficult moment is,

00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:20.880
do I truly understand and accept the reality of my situation?

00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:27.880
Here in Proverbs 28 verse 26, it starts by saying,

00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:33.880
whoever trusts in his own heart is stupid.

00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:38.880
We might tend to put on emotional blinders

00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:40.880
and see only what we want to see.

00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:45.880
Many people slip into denial as a coping mechanism.

00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:49.880
However, the Proverbs continues in the second part by saying,

00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:55.880
what the one who walks in wisdom will escape.

00:42:55.880 --> 00:43:00.880
This means seeing the things the way they are.

00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:06.880
Facing reality, really, facing reality is a grueling work.

00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:12.880
Indeed, it can be unpleasant and often emotionally branching.

00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:16.880
The Apostle Peter had this experience when Jesus looked at him

00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:20.880
after Peter had denied him three times.

00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:22.880
Peter faced reality.

00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:27.880
He went outside, broke down, wept bitterly.

00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:30.880
For sure, he was not looking for any excuses.

00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:34.880
This experience, as well as other situations where he received counsel,

00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:40.880
helped him to make progress and to fulfill his assignments even better.

00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:43.880
Now, what is the second factor?

00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:47.880
We call it meaning-making.

00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:52.880
We might know people who under pressure throw up their hands and cry

00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:56.880
and say, why can this happen to me?

00:43:56.880 --> 00:44:01.880
Such people see themselves as victims and living through hardship

00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:04.880
does not teach them any lessons.

00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:08.880
We, however, based on our Bible knowledge, understand why difficulties

00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:12.880
and challenging situations are sometimes unavoidable.

00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:17.880
Seeing the bigger picture adds meaning.

00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:21.880
This helps us as a resilient person not only to endure an unpleasant situation

00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:27.880
or a new circumstance, but also to look at seeming obstacle

00:44:27.880 --> 00:44:31.880
and see an opportunity in it.

00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:35.880
We all know, no one is perfect.

00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:39.880
Everyone fails at something sometime.

00:44:39.880 --> 00:44:44.880
So our choice is the manner in which we respond.

00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:48.880
We are actively trying to make the best out of it,

00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:52.880
looking ahead rather than behind.

00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:55.880
Setting goals, maybe new goals.

00:44:55.880 --> 00:45:01.880
We might remember how Brother Harold King showed this resilient disposition

00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:03.880
when he was in solitary confinement.

00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:07.880
How did he give meaning to his difficult situation

00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:10.880
by making the best out of it?

00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:12.880
He said,

00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:16.880
I arranged for a program of preaching activity,

00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:20.880
but to whom does one preach when in solitary confinement?

00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:24.880
I decided that I would build up some appropriate Bible sermons

00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:27.880
from the things I could remember

00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:32.880
and then preach to imaginary characters.

00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:35.880
So in our context, we can say,

00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:38.880
meaning making is like building a bridge

00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:41.880
from present day hardship to a better future.

00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:43.880
By means of this bridge,

00:45:43.880 --> 00:45:46.880
we make the difficult situation manageable.

00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:51.880
We remove the sense that the present is overwhelming.

00:45:51.880 --> 00:45:56.289
Now let's look at the third factor,

00:45:56.289 --> 00:46:00.289
a balanced view of ourselves.

00:46:00.289 --> 00:46:04.289
While we said at the beginning that we have to face reality

00:46:04.289 --> 00:46:07.289
which can go along with feelings of sadness and disappointment,

00:46:07.289 --> 00:46:09.289
as resilient people,

00:46:09.289 --> 00:46:11.289
we don't take the failure

00:46:11.289 --> 00:46:16.289
or a challenging situation personally.

00:46:16.289 --> 00:46:19.289
Let us please open to Romans chapter 7,

00:46:19.289 --> 00:46:22.289
because we want to demonstrate this point by the means

00:46:22.289 --> 00:46:25.289
of the example of the Apostle Paul.

00:46:25.289 --> 00:46:30.289
At times, he felt discouraged over his weaknesses.

00:46:30.289 --> 00:46:32.289
Here in chapter 7,

00:46:32.289 --> 00:46:35.289
he describes the pain of conscience

00:46:35.289 --> 00:46:40.289
that he suffered because of feeling captive to sin.

00:46:40.289 --> 00:46:43.289
But then in verse 24,

00:46:43.289 --> 00:46:46.289
he cries out saying,

00:46:46.289 --> 00:46:52.880
miserable man that I am evidently though,

00:46:52.880 --> 00:46:58.880
Paul realized that his imperfection did not define him.

00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:01.880
Nine years later,

00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:04.880
his second letter to his friend Timothy,

00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:06.880
shortly before his death,

00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:09.880
he stated his personal conclusion of the matter.

00:47:09.880 --> 00:47:13.880
Here in second Timothy, chapter 4,

00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:17.539
in verse 7, he said,

00:47:17.539 --> 00:47:21.539
I have fought the fine fight.

00:47:21.539 --> 00:47:26.539
I have run the race to the finish.

00:47:26.539 --> 00:47:32.210
I have observed the faith.

00:47:32.210 --> 00:47:34.210
Paul's problems and inner struggle

00:47:34.210 --> 00:47:37.210
did not miraculously disappear.

00:47:37.210 --> 00:47:39.210
Still, it did not prevent him

00:47:39.210 --> 00:47:44.210
from accomplishing remarkable things in Jehovah's service.

00:47:44.210 --> 00:47:46.210
So therefore, we do not berate ourselves

00:47:46.210 --> 00:47:49.210
with self-defeating language such as,

00:47:49.210 --> 00:47:54.210
I'm a failure or I'm useless.

00:47:54.210 --> 00:47:57.210
Reflecting on positive aspects of our lives

00:47:57.210 --> 00:48:00.210
and reflecting on our strengths helps us

00:48:00.210 --> 00:48:04.210
to maintain a balanced view of ourselves.

00:48:04.210 --> 00:48:07.210
So in conclusion,

00:48:07.210 --> 00:48:10.210
the experience of Martha reminded us today

00:48:10.210 --> 00:48:12.210
of the importance of building

00:48:12.210 --> 00:48:15.210
and maintaining resilience

00:48:15.210 --> 00:48:19.210
by facing reality,

00:48:19.210 --> 00:48:21.210
meaning-making,

00:48:21.210 --> 00:48:26.840
and maintaining a balanced view of ourselves.

00:48:26.840 --> 00:48:30.840
The Bible contains wonderful descriptions

00:48:30.840 --> 00:48:34.840
of how life will be in paradise.

00:48:34.840 --> 00:48:37.840
As our new music video shows,

00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:40.840
visualizing these future blessings

00:48:40.840 --> 00:48:56.800
brings joy to our heart.

00:48:56.800 --> 00:49:00.800
I close my eyes and I can see

00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:06.050
a world of peace, love, and harmony

00:49:06.050 --> 00:49:11.050
come with me and you'll see

00:49:11.050 --> 00:49:20.099
you will see it's not a dream

00:49:20.099 --> 00:49:23.739
as I'm sure you know

00:49:23.739 --> 00:49:25.739
peace things got promised

00:49:25.739 --> 00:49:29.739
so long ago we're guaranteeing

00:49:29.739 --> 00:49:34.980
sure to be you will see

00:49:34.980 --> 00:49:47.099
this joy and laughter

00:49:47.099 --> 00:49:54.230
in every sound and scene.

00:49:54.230 --> 00:49:58.230
This is the way our God

00:49:58.230 --> 00:50:02.230
meant it to be

00:50:02.230 --> 00:50:08.110
those who fell asleep alone

00:50:08.110 --> 00:50:11.110
if again we see them every day

00:50:11.110 --> 00:50:16.309
and you'll see

00:50:16.309 --> 00:50:55.159
you will see it's gone forever

00:50:55.159 --> 00:51:01.139
now it's history come with

00:51:01.139 --> 00:51:03.139
and you'll see

00:51:03.139 --> 00:51:25.579
you will see it's joy and laughter

00:51:25.579 --> 00:51:40.619
come with me and you'll see

00:51:40.619 --> 00:52:27.780
you will see it's gone forever

00:52:27.780 --> 00:52:31.780
what a beautiful song and video

00:52:31.780 --> 00:52:33.780
in our program

00:52:33.780 --> 00:52:36.780
we look back at theocratic history

00:52:36.780 --> 00:52:40.780
not to be nostalgic but to remind us

00:52:40.780 --> 00:52:43.780
that Jehovah continually

00:52:43.780 --> 00:52:47.780
improves his organization

00:52:47.780 --> 00:52:49.780
and he debuted in

00:52:49.780 --> 00:52:51.780
exciting new series

00:52:51.780 --> 00:52:53.780
our history in motion

00:52:53.780 --> 00:52:55.780
and saw the essential role

00:52:55.780 --> 00:52:59.780
that singing plays in our worship

00:52:59.780 --> 00:53:01.780
we learn how Jehovah

00:53:01.780 --> 00:53:05.780
blesses those who serve him

00:53:05.780 --> 00:53:07.780
Elizabeth gave up a glamorous

00:53:07.780 --> 00:53:09.780
career but gained spiritual

00:53:09.780 --> 00:53:11.780
treasures

00:53:11.780 --> 00:53:13.780
and we saw that although John

00:53:13.780 --> 00:53:15.780
has experienced many difficulties

00:53:15.780 --> 00:53:17.780
Jehovah has helped him

00:53:17.780 --> 00:53:19.780
maintain his joy

00:53:19.780 --> 00:53:21.780
by helping others

00:53:21.780 --> 00:53:25.780
before we conclude

00:53:25.780 --> 00:53:27.780
let's enjoy our video

00:53:27.780 --> 00:53:29.780
postcard

00:53:29.780 --> 00:53:31.780
this month

00:53:31.780 --> 00:53:33.780
we visit our brothers

00:53:33.780 --> 00:53:35.780
in Ecuador

00:53:35.780 --> 00:53:37.780
as his name suggests

00:53:37.780 --> 00:53:39.780
Ecuador is situated

00:53:39.780 --> 00:53:41.780
on Earth's equator

00:53:41.780 --> 00:53:43.780
his stretches

00:53:43.780 --> 00:53:45.780
to the Galapagos Islands

00:53:45.780 --> 00:53:47.780
to the Andes Mountains

00:53:47.780 --> 00:53:49.780
and the Amazon River Basin

00:53:49.780 --> 00:53:53.780
this is Mount Chimboraso

00:53:53.780 --> 00:53:55.780
measured from the center of the Earth

00:53:55.780 --> 00:53:57.780
it's the highest point on our planet

00:53:57.780 --> 00:53:59.780
because of the bulging of the Earth

00:53:59.780 --> 00:54:01.780
at its equator

00:54:01.780 --> 00:54:03.780
this train line was carved

00:54:03.780 --> 00:54:05.780
into the Andes more than a century ago

00:54:05.780 --> 00:54:09.780
it was used by the first missionaries

00:54:09.780 --> 00:54:11.780
who arrived in 1946

00:54:11.780 --> 00:54:13.780
today

00:54:13.780 --> 00:54:15.780
more than 100,000 of

00:54:15.780 --> 00:54:17.780
Jehovah's Witnesses proclaimed the good news

00:54:17.780 --> 00:54:19.780
in Ecuador

00:54:19.780 --> 00:54:21.780
nearly 300,000 people attended the memorial

00:54:21.780 --> 00:54:23.780
in 2020

00:54:23.780 --> 00:54:25.780
the Chantapunta

00:54:25.780 --> 00:54:27.780
Kichwa congregation began

00:54:27.780 --> 00:54:29.780
as an isolated group

00:54:29.780 --> 00:54:31.780
to support themselves

00:54:31.780 --> 00:54:33.780
our brothers raised flowers

00:54:33.780 --> 00:54:35.780
and even pan for gold

00:54:35.780 --> 00:54:37.780
but the Rzeal is for the ministry

00:54:37.780 --> 00:54:39.780
they go to great lengths to bear

00:54:39.780 --> 00:54:41.780
thorough witness in their territory

00:54:41.780 --> 00:54:43.780
where bridges aren't available

00:54:43.780 --> 00:54:45.780
they find a way

00:54:45.780 --> 00:54:47.780
they use two boats

00:54:47.780 --> 00:54:49.780
named Inok

00:54:49.780 --> 00:54:51.780
and Inok too

00:54:51.780 --> 00:54:53.780
to reach remote Kichwa-speaking communities

00:54:53.780 --> 00:54:55.780
remote communities have poor

00:54:55.780 --> 00:54:57.780
cellular service

00:54:57.780 --> 00:54:59.780
that doesn't stop this Bible student

00:54:59.780 --> 00:55:01.780
look what he does

00:55:01.780 --> 00:55:03.780
to get a good signal

00:55:03.780 --> 00:55:05.780
so he can join meetings

00:55:05.780 --> 00:55:07.780
and have his study

00:55:07.780 --> 00:55:09.780
the brothers use a high-frequency radio

00:55:09.780 --> 00:55:11.780
to conduct return visits

00:55:11.780 --> 00:55:13.780
and Bible studies

00:55:13.780 --> 00:55:15.780
our brothers have arranged for talks

00:55:15.780 --> 00:55:17.780
and the memorial to be given

00:55:17.780 --> 00:55:19.780
in war or any

00:55:19.780 --> 00:55:21.780
and indigenous language that's not yet translated

00:55:21.780 --> 00:55:23.780
this little girl

00:55:23.780 --> 00:55:25.780
whose family is part of the congregation

00:55:25.780 --> 00:55:27.780
shares videos with war or any

00:55:27.780 --> 00:55:29.780
speaking children

00:55:29.780 --> 00:55:33.030
she's four years old

00:55:33.030 --> 00:55:35.030
our dear brothers and sisters

00:55:35.030 --> 00:55:37.030
from the Chantapunta Kichwa congregation

00:55:37.030 --> 00:55:39.030
in Ecuador

00:55:39.030 --> 00:55:41.030
send their love and greetings

00:55:41.030 --> 00:55:43.030
to the worldwide brotherhood

00:55:43.030 --> 00:55:46.860
the on my friend

00:55:46.860 --> 00:55:48.860
I want to thank you so very much

00:55:48.860 --> 00:55:50.860
for helping out with this program

00:55:50.860 --> 00:55:52.860
I really appreciated the help

00:55:52.860 --> 00:55:54.860
and together

00:55:54.860 --> 00:55:56.860
we send all of you

00:55:56.860 --> 00:55:58.860
our warm Christian love

00:55:58.860 --> 00:56:00.860
from the world headquarters

00:56:00.860 --> 00:56:02.860
of Chihuahua's witnesses

00:56:02.860 --> 00:56:04.860
