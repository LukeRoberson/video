00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:10.830
I learned the truth as a child and since then have always had the struggle to conduct myself in a way that pleases Jehovah.

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.830
I don't find it easy to control my temper or to keep calm.

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:23.829
When I first arrived in this country, a brother treated me in an unkind manner and was not very hospitable.

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:29.829
Because of this, I started feeling resentment toward him.

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:36.829
So much so that when he called me on the phone, I spoke to him very rudely.

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:45.829
My wife had to help me, reminding me that both the brother and I are imperfect and that the feelings I had toward him were not healthy.

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:51.829
During that time I felt awful and really bad about my relationship with Jehovah.

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:54.829
Discipline is never a cause for joy.

00:00:54.829 --> 00:01:02.829
And especially when I receive a letter from the branch correcting and counseling me for something I have not been doing right.

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:05.829
It certainly makes me feel uncomfortable.

00:01:05.829 --> 00:01:13.829
But I try to reflect on the fact that acting in a cord with Jehovah's wisdom will bring me blessings.

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:23.829
Prayer to Jehovah, Bible principles, and trusting that Jehovah will give me the needed direction has really helped me.

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:28.829
As the Psalms mention, Jehovah is aware that we are dust.

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.829
It's as if he were saying to me, son, you make so many mistakes.

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:40.829
But I love you anyway. I can use you in my service and I know that you will succeed.

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:52.829
And of course, it's possible because Jehovah has always helped his servants, all of them, from able down to our day, all of us who are serving him are imperfect people.
