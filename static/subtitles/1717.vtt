00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.990
My dad sold the house to buy musical instruments, so that us children could become great artists.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.260
And we achieved just that.

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:30.620
We made it to the top.

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:36.619
My dancing style became so famous that they would advertise with only a picture of me.

00:00:36.619 --> 00:00:52.429
Wherever they put that image, everyone knew those Rosario would be there.

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:55.429
I really liked dancing. I loved it.

00:00:55.429 --> 00:00:57.429
I loved the makeup.

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:02.429
The clothes, the stage, that was me.

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:09.349
But after the concerts were over, I felt empty.

00:01:09.349 --> 00:01:16.349
That's nothing like the happiness that comes from knowing you're doing what's right before Jehovah.

00:01:16.349 --> 00:01:22.349
That happiness doesn't fade, and it will always be there because it comes from Jehovah.

00:01:22.349 --> 00:01:35.439
When I decided to leave the group, my dad was not pleased.

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:42.219
He had worked so hard for it.

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:45.219
Thanks God.

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:51.469
Difficult.

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:58.469
This opposition really pained me because my dad and I had always enjoyed a beautiful friendship.

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.980
We were very close.

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:05.980
Despite the way he treated us, we never disrespected him.

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.979
We were always kind to him.

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:15.379
And because of that, little by little, he started to soften.

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:20.379
One day, one of my sons asked, why don't you invite him to a meeting?

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:22.379
My dad's eyes lit up.

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:26.379
And he said, I've been wanting to go for some time now.

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:29.379
And we started studying with him.

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:32.379
He knew that he had found the truth.

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:39.389
He enrolled in the school. He gave his first part.

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:43.389
So the truth really touched him deeply.

00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:47.389
I asked him one day during the study.

00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:49.389
Dad, tell me.

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:51.389
What do you think now?

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:55.389
Do you think I made a good decision in leaving the group?

00:02:55.389 --> 00:02:57.389
And following this path?

00:02:57.389 --> 00:03:00.389
And dedicating my life to Jehovah?

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:05.389
He looked at me and said, you did well.

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:08.389
You made a very good decision.

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:13.389
I only wish I had been able to raise all of you in the truth.

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:20.409
Dad saw his children succeed, accomplished so much,

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:23.409
and see their dreams come true.

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:29.330
But he realized that that wasn't everything.

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:35.330
He realized that true happiness comes from serving the Creator, Jehovah God.

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:40.330
It reminded me of the words of the Apostle Paul at Philippians 3.8.

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:46.330
He said that he considered what he did before as a lot of refuge.

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.330
We felt the same.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:52.330
We were willing to leave everything behind.

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:56.330
After a concert, there was that emptiness inside.

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:02.330
It's so different to the way I feel after a meeting with the brothers and sisters,

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:06.330
or after I give a Bible study,

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:10.330
or after a day serving at Bethel with Roberto, my husband,

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:14.330
that happiness doesn't go away.

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.329
There's nothing better than that.
