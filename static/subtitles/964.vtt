00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:07.940
The Bible contains many fundamental principles that a Christian can use every day to guide his life.

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:11.939
For example, at Proverbs chapter 13 verse 20,

00:00:11.939 --> 00:00:16.940
we're told that if we walk with wise persons, we will become wise.

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:23.940
Proverbs 28 states that if we're faithful, we will receive many blessings.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:27.940
Luckily, you have Bible principles that you live by as well.

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:37.939
However, as it pertains to pursuing peace, there is one essential principle that must be followed.

00:00:37.939 --> 00:00:39.939
Let's find out what it is.

00:00:39.939 --> 00:00:42.939
Turn with me please to Galatians chapter 6.

00:00:42.939 --> 00:00:50.990
And let's read the words of Galatians chapter 6 verses 7 and 8.

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:55.420
Here we read,

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.420
Do not be misled.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.420
God is not one to be mocked.

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.420
For whatever a person is sewing, this he will also reap.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.420
Because the one sewing with a view to his flesh will reap corruption from his flesh.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:19.420
But the one sewing with a view to the spirit will reap everlasting life from the spirit.

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.420
So the principle,

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.420
We reap what we sow.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.420
You might think of a farmer.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.420
He knows that he must plant what he hopes to reap.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.420
He also knows that he will not reap fruitage right away.

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.420
But he trusts that results will come in due time.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.420
It's similar with the quality of peace.

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.420
The only way for us to reap peace is to sow it.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:56.420
And as we put in the work to achieve it, we trust that in due time, we will reap the benefits.

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:02.420
In this symposium, we will consider viable and modern day accounts of how Jehovah's people,

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:09.419
despite particular challenges, have reaped peace after first sewing it.

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:16.419
Now one particular challenge to gaining peace is problems within the family.

00:02:16.419 --> 00:02:23.419
Because of imperfection, it's not uncommon to have disagreements, even tension from time to time.

00:02:24.419 --> 00:02:28.419
And family members may hurt one another in various ways.

00:02:28.419 --> 00:02:31.419
And usually such offenses are minor.

00:02:31.419 --> 00:02:34.419
And peace can quickly be sewn and reaped.

00:02:34.419 --> 00:02:39.770
But what if the offense is more serious?

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:45.770
A family member says or does something that hurts us deeply.

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:53.770
Well, even then, it still may be possible to sow and reap peace.

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:59.770
We can prove this by considering the Bible account of Joseph and his brothers.

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:01.770
And we're familiar with the story.

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:05.770
Out of envy, Joseph's brothers sold him into slavery.

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:08.770
And this was by no means a minor offense.

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:11.770
It began with Joseph being led to Egypt.

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:15.770
Sometime later, he was falsely accused and thrown into prison.

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:24.770
So for 13 years, Joseph suffered this treatment when he had done nothing to deserve it.

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:29.770
Now it could have been very easy for Joseph to feel that if he ever saw his brothers again,

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:36.770
the best option for peace would be not to have any dealings with them at all.

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:39.770
Perhaps we might feel the same way as well.

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:42.770
But Joseph didn't do that.

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:48.770
In fact, after some years passed, both Joseph and his brothers sold peace.

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:50.770
Now note how this was done.

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:52.770
Turn with me please to the 105th Psalm.

00:03:52.770 --> 00:04:00.780
And note the 19th verse of Psalm 105.

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:08.819
It says until the time that his word proved true,

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:13.819
the saying of Jehovah is what refined him.

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:19.449
Joseph trusted in Jehovah to refine him.

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:25.449
To shape his thinking and godly qualities, he refused to become bitter.

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:31.449
In fact, how interesting it is to note that there is nothing in the scriptures to indicate

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:36.449
that Joseph ever told anyone, not even Pharaoh,

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:42.449
that his brothers were the ones who kidnapped him and sold him as a slave.

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:45.449
And how about Joseph's brothers?

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:49.449
Years after they had mistreated him, they met Joseph in Egypt.

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:54.449
When Joseph tested them by giving the youngest brother Benjamin significantly more attention

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:59.449
than he gave the others, he saw his brothers had changed.

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:02.449
They had like goal of envy.

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:07.449
They showed genuine concern for their brother and for their father Jacob.

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:14.449
Joseph realized that his brothers were repentant and he forgave them.

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:18.449
And because Joseph and his brothers were willing to take steps to sow peace,

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:29.139
they reaped the benefits and eventually were able to enjoy a harmonious relationship.

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:34.139
Well, how can the example of Joseph and his brothers help us today?

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:40.139
In the following dramatization, notice how a family member sows peace.

00:05:40.139 --> 00:06:00.360
Every morning, and I mean every morning, there's Jeremy singing at the top of his lungs.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.360
Okay, I wasn't the only one.

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.360
No, but you were the loudest.

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:07.360
Spoken like a true big brother.

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:12.360
I was always impressed with how close you two were.

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:17.360
Well, it wasn't always that way.

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.360
No.

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.360
I mean, it started out that way.

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:25.360
Nick and I, we weren't just brothers.

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.360
We were friends.

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.360
But then the family business ran into trouble.

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:37.360
And what started as a small disagreement just exploded.

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.360
How are business works?

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:44.360
Instead of criticizing, could you just once?

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.360
Jeremy!

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:50.360
Do you have any idea what this is going to cost us?

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:55.360
I didn't have a choice. You went behind my back. What's your problem?

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:57.360
You, you're the problem.

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:11.230
We tried to work it out.

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:15.980
But things just got worse.

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:18.980
It was like a door slam shut between us.

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:22.980
On the outside, I acted like everything was fine.

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:25.980
But inside, I couldn't let it go.

00:07:25.980 --> 00:08:00.899
I felt like a total hypocrite, and that had to change.

00:08:00.899 --> 00:08:10.980
I needed a lot of help from Jehovah to let go, to move on,

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:16.980
and make things right with Nick.

00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:21.699
It took a long time for the wounds to heal.

00:08:21.699 --> 00:08:32.289
And for us to trust each other, the way we used to.

00:08:32.289 --> 00:08:54.450
But we did. I'm so grateful that we made peace before the world turned upside down.

00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:59.450
So how can you and I imitate Joseph and his brothers?

00:08:59.450 --> 00:09:01.450
Let's discuss three steps.

00:09:01.450 --> 00:09:08.450
The first step is found in Ephesians chapter 4, verse 32.

00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:10.450
Let's read that.

00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:16.620
Ephesians 4, verse 32.

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:22.620
But become kind to one another, tenderly compassionate, freely forgiving one another,

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:28.620
just as God also by Christ freely forgave you.

00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:33.620
So first, we must be ready to forgive.

00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:39.620
If we let grievances and resentment build up and develop in our hearts,

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:42.620
it becomes even more difficult to be forgiving.

00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:48.620
Did you note in the video what started as a small disagreement between Nick and Jeremy

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:53.620
exploded into something much bigger? Why?

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:58.620
Jeremy could not let go of his resentment towards his brother.

00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:02.620
We must work to treat others in a forgiving way,

00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:05.620
just as Jehovah treats us.

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:13.029
The second step, don't dwell on the offense.

00:10:13.029 --> 00:10:15.029
Proverbs 17 and 9 says,

00:10:15.029 --> 00:10:20.029
The one who keeps harping on a matter separates close friends.

00:10:20.029 --> 00:10:24.029
And isn't that how Jeremy described the relationship with his brother?

00:10:24.029 --> 00:10:28.029
It was a door slam shut between them.

00:10:28.029 --> 00:10:31.029
It wasn't until steps were taken to so peace,

00:10:31.029 --> 00:10:35.029
having that open, honest communication with each other,

00:10:35.029 --> 00:10:38.029
spending time together, working with each other in the ministry.

00:10:38.029 --> 00:10:43.029
Only then did things start to improve.

00:10:43.029 --> 00:10:45.029
And did you notice?

00:10:45.029 --> 00:10:49.029
Everything did not go back to normal right away.

00:10:49.029 --> 00:10:53.029
It took time to read peace.

00:10:53.029 --> 00:10:56.029
Time for those wounds to heal.

00:10:56.029 --> 00:10:59.029
Time to regain lost trust,

00:10:59.029 --> 00:11:03.470
so we can't look for miracles.

00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:07.470
But we should look for progress.

00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:10.470
Like the farmer, trust that.

00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:15.470
In new time, we will see results from our efforts.

00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:21.070
And here's where the all-important third step comes in.

00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:28.070
Ask Jehovah in prayer to help us to let go of resentment.

00:11:28.070 --> 00:11:31.070
Remember Psalm 105, 19?

00:11:31.070 --> 00:11:35.070
It was the sayings of Jehovah that helped refine Joseph

00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:38.070
to develop the qualities needed not to become bitter

00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:41.070
and to let go of any resentment.

00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:45.070
In the video, Jeremy acknowledged that he needed Jehovah's help,

00:11:45.070 --> 00:11:50.070
to let go and to move on.

00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:54.669
And Jehovah can do the same for us.

00:11:54.669 --> 00:11:56.669
It's not easy when we go through situations

00:11:56.669 --> 00:11:59.669
that threaten the peace of our family.

00:11:59.669 --> 00:12:02.669
But if we live by this fundamental principle,

00:12:02.669 --> 00:12:05.669
we reap what we sow,

00:12:05.669 --> 00:12:08.669
then we can be assured that with the forgiving spirit,

00:12:08.669 --> 00:12:11.669
looking for opportunities to sow peace,

00:12:11.669 --> 00:12:14.669
and be seeking Jehovah for his help,

00:12:14.669 --> 00:12:17.669
that our efforts will be blessed.

00:12:17.669 --> 00:12:20.669
And in due time, we and our family

00:12:20.669 --> 00:12:23.669
will now present the next talk of this symposium,

00:12:23.669 --> 00:12:27.980
how they sowed and reaped peace.

00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:30.980
They give you a nice.
