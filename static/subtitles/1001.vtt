WEBVTT

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:25.079
We extend a warm welcome to all who accepted an invitation to join us for this convention.

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:30.199
We live in a world that has grown deeply distrustful.

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:35.079
Can we really believe the Bible's promises for the future?

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:39.600
If so, what must we do to benefit from them?

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.520
Brother William Turner, a helper to the service committee, will answer those questions in the

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:56.009
Discourse entitled, Have Faith in the Good News.

00:00:56.009 --> 00:01:02.649
Have you ever received an email from an unknown source informing you of great news?

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:05.129
You're a grand prize winner.

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.969
Just click on the link to receive your prize.

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:11.090
Or maybe it was a phone call.

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.049
The person says they have exciting news.

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.969
You've just won something of value.

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:17.689
But hurry, limited time only.

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:23.340
All you have to do is provide your personal information.

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:31.180
Sadly, the great and exciting news usually doesn't turn out as present.

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.859
This highlights that no matter the form or method that we receive it, much of the news

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:45.900
and information we're given today, misleads, misinforms, and often leaves us disappointed.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.500
Our world is just saturated with bad news.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:57.700
Even just watching the local news can leave us feeling anxious, depressed, even fearful.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:04.459
So it's no wonder that when people actually do receive good news, they're often skeptical.

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:11.500
Feeling that if something seems too good to be true, it probably is.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.979
The Bible tells us it's actually wise to be cautious about the news we believe.

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:20.379
But it also tells us that there is news.

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:23.939
Good news that we can trust.

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:28.819
I invite you to start with me pleasing your Bibles to the book of Mark.

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:39.099
And in Mark 1, note the words of Mark 1 verses 14 and 15.

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:40.939
It reads,

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:45.939
Now after John was arrested, Jesus went into Galilee, preaching the good news of God

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:47.379
and saying,

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:54.460
The appointed time has been fulfilled, and the kingdom of God has drawn near, repent,

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:59.419
and have faith in the good news.

00:02:59.419 --> 00:03:02.979
Have faith in the good news.

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:05.939
This is the theme of our discussion.

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:11.139
To better understand Jesus' words, we need to answer three questions.

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:16.060
First, what is the good news?

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.139
Second, why can we have faith in it?

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:25.659
And third, how can we build such faith?

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:29.819
Knowing the answers to these questions will help us to have faith in the good news

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:34.020
and fill our life with real purpose.

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.939
Well, let's address our first question.

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:40.659
What specifically is the good news that Jesus was referring to?

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:45.969
Well, let's go back in the Bible this time to the book of Luke.

00:03:45.969 --> 00:03:57.840
In Luke 8, notice Luke 8 verse 1.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.120
Shortly afterward, he traveled from city to city and from village to village,

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.919
preaching and declaring the good news of the kingdom of God

00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:09.840
and the twelve were with him.

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:13.280
So what was that good news that Jesus preached?

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:19.439
The verse states, the good news of the kingdom of God.

00:04:19.439 --> 00:04:25.360
So an important aspect of the good news is the message about God's kingdom.

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:32.240
This kingdom is a real government in heaven with a heavenly king and earthly subjects.

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.959
Jesus' earthly life as a grown man was devoted to preaching and declaring God's kingdom

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.720
as the only solution to man's problems.

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.879
And how did he do it?

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:49.319
What the simplest of tools is mouth and his feet.

00:04:49.319 --> 00:04:54.639
Notice he walked tirelessly from city to city and village to village hundreds of miles

00:04:54.639 --> 00:05:01.680
on dusty roads, even without food at times, just to share this message with others.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:06.160
He even taught his disciples this good news so that they could share and extend the good news

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:11.480
well beyond the cities and villages that Jesus preached.

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:18.519
And you might be wondering, why should this good news that Jesus preached about 2,000 years ago

00:05:18.519 --> 00:05:21.720
be of interest to us today?

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:27.319
It's because the message of the good news that Jesus taught promises future blessings

00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:31.439
for obedient humans living under the rulership of God's kingdom.

00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:35.680
So that affects all mankind today, that affects you and me.

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:41.079
And these blessings will touch every facet of life.

00:05:41.079 --> 00:05:43.360
Let's consider a few examples.

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.800
Let's start with our physical health.

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:55.560
Turn with me, please, to the book of Isaiah, in Isaiah chapter 33.

00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:01.600
And we're going to read the first part of verse 24.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:05.199
Isaiah 33, 24.

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:11.089
And no resident will say, I am sick.

00:06:11.089 --> 00:06:14.490
You know, that's such a simple statement.

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:18.250
But can you just process what that means?

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:26.449
To never again say or hear someone say, I'm sick.

00:06:26.449 --> 00:06:29.449
I don't feel well.

00:06:29.449 --> 00:06:34.089
Something is not right with me.

00:06:34.089 --> 00:06:40.089
Just think of the millions that have suffered illness due to the pandemic.

00:06:40.089 --> 00:06:48.709
The millions that are coping with the disability, and then all the diseases,

00:06:48.709 --> 00:06:54.430
the diseases that are common, the diseases that are rare,

00:06:54.430 --> 00:07:01.430
the ones that are life-threatening, chronic, debilitating,

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:06.029
the diseases where you look fine on the outside, but inside,

00:07:06.029 --> 00:07:10.329
it's a day to day struggle.

00:07:10.329 --> 00:07:15.290
See, under God's kingdom, all of it, all disabilities, all diseases,

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:18.410
all health problems will no longer plague mankind.

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:22.209
They will all be a thing of the past.

00:07:22.209 --> 00:07:26.810
And just to show you how wonderful this is, how far reaching this blessing will be,

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:29.290
even if we don't have a disease or disability,

00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:38.360
think of what your life would be like right now if you just didn't hurt.

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:41.439
See, right now it hurts if we stand too long.

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:43.199
It hurts if we sit too long.

00:07:43.199 --> 00:07:46.839
It hurts if we walk too long, if we sleep too long.

00:07:46.839 --> 00:07:52.680
But to be pain-free and to know that each day,

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:57.319
you're just going to feel better and better.

00:07:57.319 --> 00:07:59.399
Isn't that good news?

00:07:59.399 --> 00:08:03.639
You see, so much is going to be accomplished from this promise

00:08:03.639 --> 00:08:09.959
where no one will say, I am sick.

00:08:09.959 --> 00:08:12.959
Well, let's consider another blessing.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.439
As a family head, we know it's a priority for you to care for your family

00:08:17.439 --> 00:08:20.560
and keep a roof over their heads.

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:24.680
But is it a struggle to make it in me?

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:30.120
How often do you worry about having a job or keeping your job?

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:33.919
Well, just think of how you'll feel when these words become a reality.

00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:36.399
Still in the book of Isaiah, this time,

00:08:36.399 --> 00:08:40.460
Isaiah chapter 65,

00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:48.799
and note verses 21 and 22,

00:08:48.799 --> 00:08:51.399
they will build houses and live in them,

00:08:51.399 --> 00:08:54.600
and they will plant vineyards and eat their fruitage.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:57.200
They will not build for someone else to inhabit,

00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:00.000
nor will they plant for others to eat.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.600
For the days of my people will be like the days of a tree,

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:09.799
and the work of their hands my chosen ones will enjoy to the full.

00:09:09.799 --> 00:09:11.799
You see the blessing?

00:09:11.799 --> 00:09:16.000
No one will be homeless or unemployed.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
And as you know, nowhere in these verses,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.600
do we see the words rent or lease?

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:24.399
Under this kingdom arrangement,

00:09:24.399 --> 00:09:31.200
you see, we're going to experience the full joy of ownership.

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:32.200
Can you imagine that?

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:35.000
Can you imagine the satisfaction,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:41.000
the dignity that comes from living in a home you personally built?

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:46.000
And then working with your hands for the direct benefit of your family?

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.399
It's a good feeling, isn't it?

00:09:48.399 --> 00:09:51.000
And of course, if you're planting your own vineyard,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.600
well, that's an indication of another blessing,

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:57.000
an abundance of food.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.600
The Bible describes this quite beautifully,

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:03.159
turn please to the book of Psalms.

00:10:03.159 --> 00:10:11.889
The 72nd Psalm,

00:10:11.889 --> 00:10:17.039
and note Psalm 72 verse 16,

00:10:17.039 --> 00:10:20.039
there will be an abundance of grain on the earth.

00:10:20.039 --> 00:10:23.039
On the top of the mountains, it will overflow.

00:10:23.039 --> 00:10:25.840
His fruit will flourish as in Lebanon.

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:32.360
And in the cities, people will blossom like the vegetation of the earth.

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:38.360
We've all seen heartbreaking pictures of neglected and starving children.

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:43.360
And we've likely seen the increasing number of food lines during this pandemic.

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:45.559
But you see, under God's government,

00:10:45.559 --> 00:10:49.960
no one will be without sufficient food or undernourished.

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:54.559
Poverty and food shortages will be gone.

00:10:54.559 --> 00:11:01.960
And what a beautiful word picture this verse gives us of how the ground will produce abundantly.

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:06.159
It would be as if grain were growing along the sides of a mountain,

00:11:06.159 --> 00:11:09.360
clear to the top and overflowing.

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:14.269
You see, we have so many wonderful blessings to look forward to.

00:11:14.269 --> 00:11:17.070
But for this next blessing,

00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:23.669
God will use his creative powers to do one of the most wonderful works of all time.

00:11:23.669 --> 00:11:26.269
Let's go back to the book of Isaiah.

00:11:26.269 --> 00:11:29.870
This time, Isaiah chapter 25,

00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:36.840
verse 8,

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:40.240
Isaiah 25,

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:43.039
verse 8,

00:11:43.039 --> 00:11:45.039
there were told

00:11:45.039 --> 00:11:48.340
he will swallow up death forever.

00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:53.240
And the sovereign Lord Jehovah will wipe away the tears from all faces.

00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:55.440
The reproach of his people,

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:58.340
he will take away from all the earth.

00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:02.919
For Jehovah himself has spoken it.

00:12:02.919 --> 00:12:07.120
You know, some may consider this to be the best news of all.

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:15.539
What a joy it is going to be when death will be no more removed forever.

00:12:15.539 --> 00:12:20.940
If any of us have ever had someone close to us taken away by death,

00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:23.240
we know the emptiness.

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:28.440
The anguish, the painful scars that death leaves behind.

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:30.840
And it's something that affects all of us.

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:35.940
So just think, how many memorial services have you attended since this pandemic?

00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:40.039
You see, for some, it's just too painful to think about.

00:12:40.039 --> 00:12:41.740
One brother made the statement.

00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:43.139
He said,

00:12:43.139 --> 00:12:46.240
I don't even look forward to Saturdays anymore.

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:51.740
It seems that Saturdays have been set aside for funeral and memorial services.

00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:54.340
But we can relate to that, can't we?

00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:55.539
But you see what the Bible says?

00:12:55.539 --> 00:12:59.840
The Bible says that God is going to swallow up death forever.

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:04.639
So when something is swallowed, it's gone, destroyed.

00:13:04.639 --> 00:13:08.340
So that is going to be a time to rejoice.

00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:10.740
But the good news doesn't stop there.

00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:14.940
Because not only is Jehovah going to put an end to death,

00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:17.340
but know what he does next.

00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:22.379
Look over chapter 26 this time, verse 19.

00:13:22.379 --> 00:13:24.980
He says, Your dead will live.

00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:27.179
My corpses will rise up,

00:13:27.179 --> 00:13:30.980
awake and shall joyfully you residents in the dust.

00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:33.679
For your do is as the dew of the morning

00:13:33.679 --> 00:13:40.019
and the earth will let those powerless in death come to life.

00:13:40.019 --> 00:13:43.919
So now we're talking about the resurrection.

00:13:43.919 --> 00:13:48.220
Our dead loved ones will return to life.

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:50.320
And you know the expression there,

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:54.320
awake and shout joyfully.

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:55.320
That was interesting.

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:58.419
The new English Bible quotes this as saying,

00:13:58.419 --> 00:14:04.919
They that sleep in the earth will awake and shout for joy.

00:14:04.919 --> 00:14:07.820
And doesn't that nicely describe how right now

00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:12.320
our dead loved ones are just sleeping?

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:16.720
And just like an infant is protected within its mother's womb,

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:20.519
the dead are in the safest situation imaginable,

00:14:20.519 --> 00:14:24.019
perfectly preserved and protected

00:14:24.019 --> 00:14:26.519
within Jehovah's memory.

00:14:26.519 --> 00:14:27.820
And in God's due time,

00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:30.320
they will be brought back to life.

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:32.320
And we can be there.

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:35.019
We can be there to warmly welcome them

00:14:35.019 --> 00:14:40.519
just like a newborn is greeted by a loving waiting family.

00:14:40.519 --> 00:14:43.519
So many tremendous blessings.

00:14:43.519 --> 00:14:45.620
And these blessings that we've considered,

00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:49.019
this is just a small sampling of the good news.

00:14:49.019 --> 00:14:52.720
There's so much more that this kingdom will accomplish.

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:54.519
According to Psalm 46 verse nine,

00:14:54.519 --> 00:14:58.220
war will cease to exist in Revelation 11,

00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:02.620
18, anyone and anything that dirties the earth,

00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:06.320
pollutes the air and water or kills off the earth's wildlife.

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:14.909
God promises that he will bring to ruin those who ruin or pollute the earth.

00:15:15.009 --> 00:15:20.110
So we've established the answer to our first question.

00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:22.409
What is the good news?

00:15:22.409 --> 00:15:25.909
The good news is the news of God's kingdom.

00:15:25.909 --> 00:15:29.909
This heavenly government that will rule and provide tremendous blessings

00:15:29.909 --> 00:15:33.009
to obedient mankind.

00:15:33.009 --> 00:15:37.110
Now with all these wonderful promises in store for mankind,

00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:41.409
can you think of any better news that you'd like to receive?

00:15:41.409 --> 00:15:46.309
Wouldn't you agree that these promises are worth investigating?

00:15:46.309 --> 00:15:48.710
Indeed they are.

00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:51.309
But here's the challenge.

00:15:51.309 --> 00:15:54.610
The idea of living forever under such wonderful conditions

00:15:54.610 --> 00:15:57.809
might be difficult for some to comprehend,

00:15:57.809 --> 00:16:03.509
especially what life is like right now at present.

00:16:03.509 --> 00:16:08.909
So what of those that hear this good news are skeptical?

00:16:09.009 --> 00:16:14.210
What if they feel if it seems too good to be true?

00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:17.620
It probably is.

00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:22.419
Well, let's address this by answering our second question.

00:16:22.419 --> 00:16:26.419
Why can we have faith in the good news?

00:16:26.419 --> 00:16:30.720
In other words, why can we firmly believe that all the things we've just considered,

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:37.700
all these promises from God are true and will be fulfilled?

00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:42.000
Well, just like any news or information that we receive,

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.200
the credibility all starts with the source, doesn't it?

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:50.600
The good news comes from Jehovah God himself.

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:53.700
And let's note what the Bible says about him.

00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:57.200
Turn with me, please, to the book of Titus.

00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:01.149
And Titus chapter 1.

00:17:01.149 --> 00:17:09.059
And we'll read Titus chapter 1 verses 1 and 2.

00:17:09.059 --> 00:17:13.359
Paul, a slave of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ

00:17:13.359 --> 00:17:16.160
according to the faith of God's chosen ones,

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:20.160
and the accurate knowledge of the truth that is according to Godly devotion

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:24.259
and is based on a hope of the everlasting life that God

00:17:24.259 --> 00:17:30.559
who cannot lie promised long ago.

00:17:30.559 --> 00:17:34.859
So we can be certain that these promises will be fulfilled

00:17:34.859 --> 00:17:38.960
because the Bible tells us we have a basis for hope

00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:47.259
because God who cannot lie is the one who made these promises.

00:17:47.259 --> 00:17:50.259
But what exactly does this mean?

00:17:50.259 --> 00:17:53.259
Well, it's illustrated this way.

00:17:53.259 --> 00:17:58.160
Have you ever asked a friend to meet you or pick you up to go somewhere?

00:17:58.160 --> 00:17:59.859
And your friend says, oh, no problem.

00:17:59.859 --> 00:18:02.059
I'll be there at seven.

00:18:02.059 --> 00:18:04.359
But as soon as he says it,

00:18:04.359 --> 00:18:10.160
you already know he's not coming until 730, maybe even 8.

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:13.059
We all seem to have that friend, don't we?

00:18:13.059 --> 00:18:16.859
But why do we know this about our friend?

00:18:16.859 --> 00:18:19.859
Well, likely it's because of his past record.

00:18:19.859 --> 00:18:22.960
You see, if our friend, although we'll intentioned,

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:25.359
has a pattern of being lead,

00:18:25.359 --> 00:18:31.359
he's given us a basis to question his promise.

00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:34.460
Of course, his humans were all imperfect.

00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:42.160
But the point is our record of works form a basis for our credibility.

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:45.859
So now we elevate this to Almighty God.

00:18:45.859 --> 00:18:50.460
So when it comes to Jehovah, the source of the good news,

00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:52.859
the one who cannot lie.

00:18:52.859 --> 00:18:54.460
You see, if we examine his record,

00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:58.660
we'll see that he has given us a basis to trust him.

00:18:58.759 --> 00:19:01.759
He has a perfect record of fulfilling his promises.

00:19:01.759 --> 00:19:07.059
They come true 100% of the time.

00:19:07.059 --> 00:19:12.559
And it's not just the general prophecy itself.

00:19:12.559 --> 00:19:16.829
It's the accurate details as well.

00:19:16.829 --> 00:19:19.730
For example, the prophet Isaiah foretold

00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:24.329
that the mighty city of Babylon would be destroyed.

00:19:24.329 --> 00:19:29.529
But then he went into detail exactly how the city would be defeated

00:19:29.529 --> 00:19:31.930
from the river being dried up

00:19:31.930 --> 00:19:34.430
to the gates being left wide open.

00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:36.829
He even named the one who was going to overthrow Babylon

00:19:36.829 --> 00:19:40.230
some 200 years before it happened.

00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:44.430
And history confirms that every detail of this prophecy

00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:46.630
was fulfilled.

00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:49.829
It was even prophesied that Babylon would become piles of stone

00:19:49.829 --> 00:19:52.430
and never again be inhabited.

00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:56.630
And that stands true down to this day.

00:19:56.730 --> 00:20:00.829
And this is just one of a number of prophecies.

00:20:00.829 --> 00:20:02.630
You see, when we take the time to investigate,

00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:05.930
we find other prophecies such as the number of years

00:20:05.930 --> 00:20:08.130
when the land of Judah would be desolate.

00:20:08.130 --> 00:20:10.430
The exact year when the Messiah would come,

00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:12.930
where he would be born, what he would do,

00:20:12.930 --> 00:20:16.029
how he would die and be raised from the dead,

00:20:16.029 --> 00:20:22.130
all fulfilled exactly as foretold.

00:20:22.130 --> 00:20:25.529
So the fact that so many Bible prophecies

00:20:25.529 --> 00:20:29.930
of already come true shows that we can trust

00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:34.869
what the Bible says about the future.

00:20:34.869 --> 00:20:38.970
Now here's another reason we can have faith in the good news.

00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:46.779
Let's go back to our Bibles this time to Matthew 9.

00:20:46.779 --> 00:20:55.049
In Matthew 9, note verse 35.

00:20:55.049 --> 00:20:58.849
And Jesus sat out on a tour of all the cities and villages

00:20:58.849 --> 00:21:01.450
teaching in their synagogues and preaching the good news

00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:04.250
of the kingdom and curing every sort of disease

00:21:04.250 --> 00:21:07.250
and every sort of infirmity.

00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:09.150
Now you recall earlier we discussed the efforts

00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:12.349
Jesus put forth to declare the good news.

00:21:12.349 --> 00:21:16.049
But now we see that as he went to those cities and villages,

00:21:16.049 --> 00:21:19.450
not only did he preach, but empowered by God,

00:21:19.450 --> 00:21:23.650
he performed miracles that proved the credibility

00:21:23.650 --> 00:21:26.150
of the good news.

00:21:26.150 --> 00:21:30.849
And some of those miracles were witnessed by thousands

00:21:30.849 --> 00:21:36.589
to the point where they cannot be denied even by his apostles.

00:21:36.589 --> 00:21:41.289
So to this point, we've established what the good news is,

00:21:41.289 --> 00:21:43.390
the news regarding God's kingdom.

00:21:43.390 --> 00:21:48.890
And now we've answered why we can have faith in the good news.

00:21:48.890 --> 00:21:54.390
The source of the good news is Jehovah, a God who cannot lie

00:21:54.390 --> 00:21:58.890
and who has a perfect track record of keeping his promises.

00:21:58.990 --> 00:22:03.490
And then God's son, Jesus Christ, who is king of God's kingdom.

00:22:03.490 --> 00:22:06.990
He solidified that evidence during his time on the earth

00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:13.200
by demonstrating the power to cure disease and infirmity.

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:16.900
Today, there are millions of people from a variety of backgrounds

00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:21.900
that have taken the time to investigate the promises of God's kingdom.

00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:25.700
They have found them to be true and they have benefited

00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:27.599
from the good news.

00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:32.799
It has improved their lives now and given them a solid hope for the future.

00:22:32.799 --> 00:22:35.900
We invite you to watch the following video.

00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:47.900
And as you do, note how some have benefited from the good news.

00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:52.000
And here in war were normally my home country.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.400
I had many questions.

00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:56.700
Why do young people have to die?

00:22:56.700 --> 00:22:59.900
Why do my children have to go through this?

00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:02.799
God did not create us to make war.

00:23:02.799 --> 00:23:07.900
The priests in my church always said it is God's will.

00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:09.900
Being on the run was dreadful.

00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:13.099
More than once I thought we were going to die.

00:23:13.099 --> 00:23:16.299
Eventually, we arrived in Germany and I was convinced

00:23:16.299 --> 00:23:19.500
that the priest there could give me some answers.

00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:24.799
I went to several different churches, but no answers.

00:23:24.799 --> 00:23:27.400
I kept telling them, I'm looking for something.

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:31.900
I don't know what it is, but I didn't find it here with you.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.500
Sometimes I thought I was searching for something

00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:38.480
that no one could give me.

00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:43.380
One day, a German woman approached me in Arabic.

00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:45.579
That was amazing for me.

00:23:45.579 --> 00:23:49.079
I never had a good opinion of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:23:49.079 --> 00:23:54.579
I didn't think I could learn anything from her, but I gave her a chance.

00:23:54.579 --> 00:24:01.740
She gave me logical answers to all of my questions.

00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:06.940
In my home country, there are multiple religious groups and nationalities

00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:09.940
who hate and fight each other.

00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:12.940
But at the meetings of Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:15.940
I have seen that all people can live in peace with each other

00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:19.539
if they get to know our father in heaven.

00:24:19.539 --> 00:24:22.539
He gives love and peace.

00:24:22.539 --> 00:24:32.269
At last, I found what I had been looking for.

00:24:32.269 --> 00:24:36.670
I lived a life without rules.

00:24:36.670 --> 00:24:42.670
I used to get drunk, smoked a lot, and I became a compulsive gambler.

00:24:42.670 --> 00:24:47.069
My behavior was a complete disaster.

00:24:47.069 --> 00:24:50.670
My wife wanted to separate from me.

00:24:50.670 --> 00:24:54.470
It was a horrible time.

00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:58.269
My wife started studying the Bible with Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:24:58.269 --> 00:25:03.670
I remember being doubtful, very doubtful.

00:25:03.670 --> 00:25:08.470
But there was one thing that started to make me think.

00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:15.470
Both my wife and my children look more peaceful, more joyful, happier.

00:25:15.470 --> 00:25:20.930
That's why I even accepted a Bible study.

00:25:20.930 --> 00:25:25.730
I came to realize that Jehovah lives each one of us as an individual.

00:25:25.730 --> 00:25:29.529
That gave me real hope for the future.

00:25:29.529 --> 00:25:33.329
Everything I was studying in the Bible helped me to understand

00:25:33.329 --> 00:25:39.339
that doing Jehovah's will is in our best interest.

00:25:39.339 --> 00:25:42.740
This really helped me to quit my bad habits,

00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:45.740
treat my family better,

00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:49.740
and show due respect to my wife.

00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:52.339
If Jehovah hadn't searched for me,

00:25:52.339 --> 00:25:58.740
if I hadn't come to know him, we would no longer be a family.

00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:04.539
Today, we are indeed a happy family, a united family,

00:26:04.539 --> 00:26:10.019
united more than ever.

00:26:10.019 --> 00:26:17.559
Only Jehovah could perform such a miracle.

00:26:17.559 --> 00:26:20.960
Well, let's address our final question.

00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:25.559
How can you and I build faith in the good news?

00:26:25.559 --> 00:26:28.960
It may be that just like our sister in the video,

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:31.359
we have gone through situations in our life

00:26:31.359 --> 00:26:34.559
that leave us searching for answers.

00:26:34.559 --> 00:26:41.960
But our search might provide us with incorrect or misinformed information about God.

00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:44.660
So the question comes up again.

00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:46.359
How can we know?

00:26:46.359 --> 00:26:50.359
How can we be sure of what to believe?

00:26:50.359 --> 00:26:52.859
Well, the Bible gives us the answer.

00:26:52.859 --> 00:26:57.859
Turn with me, please, to the book of Hebrews.

00:26:57.859 --> 00:27:07.460
And note what is stated in Hebrews, chapter 11, verse 1.

00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:09.460
There we read.

00:27:09.559 --> 00:27:13.859
Faith is the assured expectation of what is hoped for,

00:27:13.859 --> 00:27:19.759
the evident demonstration of realities that are not seen.

00:27:19.759 --> 00:27:24.359
And you know, the footnote there for evident demonstration,

00:27:24.359 --> 00:27:28.660
it says convincing evidence.

00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:33.660
So that helps us to see that real faith is not gullible.

00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:38.160
Just like with the scammers and misinformation we spoke of earlier,

00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:41.559
you say, we don't believe what we hear just because it sounds good.

00:27:41.559 --> 00:27:46.559
No, as the footnote says, there should be convincing evidence

00:27:46.559 --> 00:27:52.160
of things that are not seen and yet real.

00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:53.259
Just illustrate this.

00:27:53.259 --> 00:27:59.460
A child may ask, how do we know that air exists?

00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:01.160
Well, we can't say, well, it just does.

00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:02.960
That's how it works.

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:06.059
No, you say likely we'd have to help the child to reason

00:28:06.059 --> 00:28:09.559
on the evidence that exists, right?

00:28:09.559 --> 00:28:16.259
His ability to breathe air in and out, the effects of the wind and so forth.

00:28:16.259 --> 00:28:20.460
And once the child is convinced of the evidence,

00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:26.960
he can now accept the existence of what is invisible to him.

00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:30.160
In this case, the air.

00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:33.460
And that is how our faith has to be.

00:28:33.559 --> 00:28:40.259
It has to be based on solid, convincing evidence.

00:28:40.259 --> 00:28:45.160
Jehovah's Witnesses worldwide have faith in the good news.

00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:47.859
They have made an examination of the Bible's promises

00:28:47.859 --> 00:28:50.559
and they've seen the evidence for themselves.

00:28:50.559 --> 00:28:52.259
Just like our brother in the video,

00:28:52.259 --> 00:28:56.759
we've also seen how the good news has not only improved our lives

00:28:56.759 --> 00:29:02.799
but it shows us evidence of Jehovah's love for us as well.

00:29:02.799 --> 00:29:04.400
Some who are listening to this program

00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:08.200
may be newly acquainted with Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:09.599
And we'd like to tell you,

00:29:09.599 --> 00:29:13.599
we are so happy that you took the time to attend.

00:29:13.599 --> 00:29:17.000
And we know that you too may have questions

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:21.700
and you need answers, truthful answers.

00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:26.000
Well, give Jehovah's Witnesses a chance.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:30.200
Give them a chance to help you find those answers in the Bible.

00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:32.099
And as you associate with them,

00:29:32.099 --> 00:29:34.599
see how they have come to believe the good news

00:29:34.599 --> 00:29:36.900
and why they have faith in it.

00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:38.400
And as your faith grows,

00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:42.900
you'll come to appreciate just how important this message is.

00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:46.200
It will move you to make any needed changes in your life.

00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:49.200
And because of the joy and happiness you feel,

00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:51.200
you say, you'll be excited, right?

00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:54.200
You'll want to share what you have learned with others.

00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:56.400
And that's good for doing so.

00:29:56.400 --> 00:30:01.380
We're reinforced Bible truth in your own mind.

00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:04.680
So from all that we've discussed,

00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:07.480
what do we conclude?

00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:10.279
If we have faith in the good news,

00:30:10.279 --> 00:30:14.779
we are firmly convinced that everything Jehovah says is true

00:30:14.779 --> 00:30:17.779
and will be fulfilled.

00:30:17.779 --> 00:30:20.980
And the way we live our lives will demonstrate that.

00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:24.779
In this world that is saturated with so much bad news,

00:30:24.779 --> 00:30:26.980
how thankful we are that we have a God

00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:30.880
that not only provides us with a basis to trust his good news,

00:30:30.980 --> 00:30:34.480
but he even shows evidence of his care and concern

00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:36.980
for us as individuals.

00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:40.079
This good news is not too good to be true.

00:30:40.079 --> 00:30:41.279
It is real.

00:30:41.279 --> 00:30:45.380
It is a reality that is soon to come.

00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:50.279
So may all of us have faith in the good news.

00:30:50.279 --> 00:30:52.279
And as we draw close to God,

00:30:52.279 --> 00:30:56.380
may we experience firsthand Jehovah's love

00:30:56.480 --> 00:31:02.980
as He rewards all those who earnestly seek Him in faith.

00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:05.980
Thank you, brother Turner, for the reviewing the evidence

00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:11.980
that all of God's promises will soon be fulfilled.

00:31:11.980 --> 00:31:16.480
Around the earth, millions are building faith in Jehovah God

00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:18.980
and His word, the Bible.

00:31:18.980 --> 00:31:21.680
If you would like to have Bible discussions,

00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:26.680
free of charge at a time and place convenient for you,

00:31:26.779 --> 00:31:29.680
please inform one of Jehovah's Witnesses

00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:33.380
or simply visit jw.org

00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:37.480
and fill out an online request for a Bible study.

00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:40.980
We will be happy to arrange for one of Jehovah's Witnesses

00:31:40.980 --> 00:31:44.470
to assist you.

00:31:44.470 --> 00:31:47.970
We have reached the conclusion of this session.

00:31:47.970 --> 00:31:50.170
We look forward to the next session

00:31:50.170 --> 00:31:54.569
in which we will see the conclusion of the Daniel drama

00:31:54.569 --> 00:31:58.069
and hear the final talk of this convention.

00:31:58.170 --> 00:32:02.470
Now let's sing a song that expresses our confidence in God

00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:04.369
and in His kingdom.

00:32:04.369 --> 00:32:08.670
We invite you to sing song number 22 entitled

00:32:08.670 --> 00:32:12.470
The Kingdom is in place, let it come.

00:32:12.470 --> 00:32:15.769
Again, that song number 22,

00:32:15.769 --> 00:32:19.269
after which you may have your local concluding prayer.
