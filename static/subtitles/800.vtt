00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:09.529
You are probably the most obedient group of people this size that has ever entered Jersey City.

00:00:09.529 --> 00:00:27.739
So we say thank you very much for being in your seats.

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:34.740
It's now my pleasure to invite you to stand and to sing song number 150.

00:00:34.740 --> 00:03:36.689
Reaching out, Matthew 937 and 38, marvelous gift from God it is.

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:47.479
We all have one. It's a bit larger in men than it is in women.

00:03:47.479 --> 00:04:01.020
What is it? It's in your mouth. It's your tongue. A small muscle, a little over three inches long.

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:08.020
We do so many things with it. You can whisper with it. You can yell with it.

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:16.019
You can swallow your food with his help and it's over the time.

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:23.970
You can stick it out over in Tibet. They stick out the tongue, some of them.

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:34.800
And it's a sign of friendship and greeting. Don't you try that here.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:43.230
It stays out of the way of your teeth when you chew. Well, most of the time.

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:50.230
It is an arduous job trying to control the tongue.

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:53.230
Well, James had something to say about it. Let's see what he had to say.

00:04:53.230 --> 00:05:01.230
Let's turn to James in our Bibles or iPads. That's the third chapter of his book.

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:05.230
And we're going to read five through ten.

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:11.230
So to the tongue is a small part of the body. And yet it makes great brags.

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:17.230
See how small a fire it takes to set a great forest of blaze.

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:23.230
The tongue is also a fire. The tongue represents the world of unrighteousness among our body members.

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:29.230
For it defiles all the body and sets the whole course of life on fire.

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:33.230
And it is set on fire by Gehenan.

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:39.230
For every kind of wild animal and bird and reptile and sea creature

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:44.230
is to be tamed and has been tamed by humans.

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:48.230
But no human can tame the tongue.

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:54.230
It is unruly and injurious, full of deadly poison.

00:05:54.230 --> 00:06:00.230
With it we praise Jehovah the Father and yet with it we curse men

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:06.230
who have come into existence in the likeness of God.

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:09.230
Out of the same mouth,

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:12.230
come blessing and cursing.

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:19.930
In our imperfect state we can't completely control it.

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:25.930
Or we try and we must try but we just can't get the job completely done.

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:28.930
But we're not going to give up.

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:31.930
We're going to keep trying.

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:34.930
We're going to watch though what we have to say, what comes out of the mouth,

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:37.930
that rolls as a result of the tongue.

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:40.930
We're going to be very careful.

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:48.930
And we know that we must reign in a runaway tongue and curb its wagging.

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:55.930
Although blessing and cursing can come out of the mouth by the use of the tongue,

00:06:55.930 --> 00:07:03.930
you will only hear blessings out of the mouths of the speakers and participants today.

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:07.930
These Christians have bridled their tongues.

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:12.819
Thank God for that.

00:07:12.819 --> 00:07:17.819
Today we are going to consider things that are, now you want to jot these down

00:07:17.819 --> 00:07:21.819
because we're going to mention them several times through the day.

00:07:21.819 --> 00:07:26.420
Here they are, true.

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:35.420
Things of serious concern, righteous, chased, lovable, well spoken out,

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:43.420
virtuous, praiseworthy, good and acceptable.

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:48.420
The tongue will work good for us today, not bad.

00:07:48.420 --> 00:08:00.420
So we say sit still and may your ears keep up with the tongues of all of our participants.

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:06.420
And as you know, in our September JW Broadcasting program,

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:13.420
Brothers Plain told us that the move of Bethel family members to the World Headquarters facility

00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:17.420
in Warwick, New York is in progress.

00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:26.420
It is already a bustling complex with so many relocated and caring for their assignments.

00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:33.419
This represents a historic change since the World Headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses

00:08:33.419 --> 00:08:45.850
had been located in Brooklyn, New York for over 100 years.

00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:47.850
We're all happy.

00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:50.850
And it's good for us who live there.

00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:55.850
It's such a beautiful place indeed and so restful.

00:08:55.850 --> 00:09:01.850
All of us feel like we have been able to add years to our lives.

00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:11.059
We can hear birds singing, crickets at night, frogs.

00:09:11.059 --> 00:09:18.399
Every now and then there's an eagle that flies over, bear and snakes.

00:09:18.399 --> 00:09:22.159
But we've been warned, watch out.

00:09:22.159 --> 00:09:30.159
We know what to do and we're just enjoying ourselves as much as we possibly can.

00:09:31.159 --> 00:09:40.159
Well, we now invite you to enjoy a video presentation about the history of headquarters in Brooklyn

00:09:40.159 --> 00:09:42.159
and the move to Warwick.

00:09:42.159 --> 00:09:51.159
So we say enjoy what you see and hear is, look at your note, true.

00:09:51.159 --> 00:10:05.090
Why are we here at Bethel today in New York City?

00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:13.090
Why did Pastor Russell leave Pittsburgh to expand the ministry worldwide?

00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:15.090
But look at it today.

00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:25.090
The satisfaction to see and blessing you're seeing the work expand to the ends of the earth and God's will being done.

00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:33.090
In 1909 Jehovah led his people in making a move that would become an indelible part of our spiritual heritage.

00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:39.090
For years, the Pennsylvania location had been adequate for the work of spreading the good news.

00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:43.090
But as time went on, challenges arose.

00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:50.090
Pittsburgh's reputation was one of steel and industry, not really one of religion and faith.

00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:54.090
The organization at that time was trying to get the preaching work accomplished.

00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:58.090
And it wasn't really well suited in Pittsburgh.

00:10:58.090 --> 00:11:03.090
So they struggled to find a city that would work for them.

00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:06.090
And one of the cities that they came across was Brooklyn.

00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:09.090
It was very famous for its pastors and its churches.

00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:12.090
It was actually nicknamed the City of Churches.

00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:16.090
And that was a good reputation to springboard the preaching work from.

00:11:16.090 --> 00:11:20.090
They were trying to preach the good news to the entire earth.

00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:24.090
But with so few Bible students, how could they possibly do it?

00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:29.090
And they realized the cultural base that existed in New York City was broad.

00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:34.090
And so they felt that this put them in the perfect position to preach to people

00:11:34.090 --> 00:11:39.090
and have them help the Bible students take the message back to their own lands.

00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:44.090
Brooklyn, just far and above, was the obvious choice to them.

00:11:44.090 --> 00:11:49.090
Officially, Brooklyn Bethel opened its doors in April, 1909.

00:11:49.090 --> 00:11:55.090
These were years of tremendous activity leading up to 1914.

00:11:55.090 --> 00:12:01.480
They also proved to be times of test.

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:05.480
The United States had declared war on Germany.

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:11.480
From March through July of 1918, eight different brothers who were taking the lead at that time

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:17.480
were arrested, sentenced, and taken off to a federal penitentiary.

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:22.480
The executive committee at headquarters consulted with other brothers.

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:28.480
It was decided to sell the Brooklyn Tabernacle and to close the Bethel home.

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:31.480
So we moved here in 1909.

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:36.480
And within 10 years, Brooklyn Bethel was closed.

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:39.480
The headquarters operations were moved back to Pittsburgh.

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:46.559
In the year 1919, when the brothers were finally released from prison,

00:12:46.559 --> 00:12:53.559
Brother Rutherford apprehended rapidly that there's still great interest in the work.

00:12:53.559 --> 00:12:56.559
Jehovah is still blessing and backing us.

00:12:56.559 --> 00:13:02.559
We need to get back, organize it, and get on with the work that has been started.

00:13:02.559 --> 00:13:07.559
So should they start from scratch and build a Bethel there in Allegheny,

00:13:07.559 --> 00:13:11.559
or should they utilize the property that they already owned in Brooklyn?

00:13:11.559 --> 00:13:14.559
They wanted to see if that was actually Jehovah's will.

00:13:14.559 --> 00:13:18.559
So what Judge Rutherford did is he asked Brother C.A.Y.

00:13:18.559 --> 00:13:20.559
who was his vice president.

00:13:20.559 --> 00:13:24.559
We need to do a test to see if Jehovah is going to bless this direction.

00:13:24.559 --> 00:13:31.559
During a warp time, any raw materials, paper, fuel, all of those things are regulated

00:13:31.559 --> 00:13:34.559
because the war effort is going on.

00:13:34.559 --> 00:13:39.559
So this was a perfect test to see if they would have enabled the brothers to get coal.

00:13:39.559 --> 00:13:42.559
He sent him back here and he said, don't just get a little coal.

00:13:42.559 --> 00:13:49.559
Get enough so that it is obvious that if we get this coal, that it only as by Jehovah's blessing.

00:13:49.559 --> 00:13:54.559
Brother Rutherford directed Brother Wise to order 500 tons of coal.

00:13:54.559 --> 00:13:56.559
And what was the outcome?

00:13:56.559 --> 00:14:03.559
When he applied to the authorities, he was granted a certificate to obtain 500 tons of coal,

00:14:03.559 --> 00:14:07.559
enough to care for their needs for years to come.

00:14:08.559 --> 00:14:15.559
So in 1919, September, I believe, is when they actually moved back from Allegheny to Brooklyn.

00:14:16.559 --> 00:14:20.559
Once it was determined that Brooklyn, New York, would be the New World headquarters,

00:14:20.559 --> 00:14:25.559
how would Jehovah use this new location to advance the preaching work?

00:14:25.559 --> 00:14:29.559
Well, we were dependent back then on commercial printeries.

00:14:29.559 --> 00:14:34.559
Brother Rutherford wondered whether we could print the watchtower ourselves.

00:14:34.559 --> 00:14:40.559
And so a printing press was obtained and a printer was set up.

00:14:40.559 --> 00:14:44.559
And in time, the book printing began.

00:14:44.559 --> 00:14:52.559
Outside commercial companies thought that we would never be capable of printing and binding books.

00:14:52.559 --> 00:15:01.320
But the brothers applied themselves, learned and with the support of the Lord, they got it going.

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:05.320
It was so evident that Jehovah was using Brooklyn Bethel.

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:12.320
All the printing of binding was done for the world here in Brooklyn.

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:18.320
After that, the organization took in brothers and the direction of the governing body

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:23.320
to come and learn what they could in Brooklyn and take it with them back to their countries

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:29.320
and see what they could do about lighting the load as little as far as the printing

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:39.429
and distribution was concerned.

00:15:39.429 --> 00:15:44.429
Soon after I got to Bethel in Japan, I worked on the web press.

00:15:44.429 --> 00:15:48.429
We always looked up to Brooklyn as our big brother.

00:15:48.429 --> 00:15:51.429
And we always looked to them for direction.

00:15:51.429 --> 00:15:55.429
Anytime we were able to come back to the United States on a brief visit,

00:15:55.429 --> 00:15:59.429
I would always make sure to see what was new and to talk with the brothers

00:15:59.429 --> 00:16:02.429
and the brothers were always very helpful.

00:16:02.429 --> 00:16:12.429
So you saw how Jehovah used this place to get the spiritual food out to the worldwide association of the brothers.

00:16:12.429 --> 00:16:18.429
It is clear that Jehovah had blessed the advancement of the printing and distribution work in Brooklyn, Bethel.

00:16:18.429 --> 00:16:27.429
But to further share the truth globally in a way that would truly touch hearts, other challenges needed to be addressed.

00:16:27.429 --> 00:16:34.429
Zechariah chapter 8 verse 23 says that 10 men out of all the languages of the nations

00:16:34.429 --> 00:16:38.429
were grabhold of the skirt of a man who was a Jew.

00:16:38.429 --> 00:16:46.429
Now that's a lot of languages, but for every person to understand,

00:16:46.429 --> 00:16:51.610
they have to hear it in their language.

00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:54.610
Though we were translating into many languages,

00:16:54.610 --> 00:16:58.610
many of these were not simultaneous with English, some of them lagged behind for many months

00:16:58.610 --> 00:17:06.460
and of course there were many languages who didn't have any literature at all.

00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:12.460
And so the governing body saw this situation and they created the department translation services.

00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:17.460
Some of the early languages were translated right here in Brooklyn.

00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:24.809
Eventually translation work was moved out to the branches where they speak those languages.

00:17:24.809 --> 00:17:28.809
The 20th century saw many technological advancements.

00:17:28.809 --> 00:17:34.809
How did Jehovah guide his servants at Brooklyn, Bethel to make progressive use of these advancements

00:17:34.809 --> 00:17:38.809
to further the preaching work to all the languages of the nations?

00:17:38.809 --> 00:17:45.809
Well the challenges of developing a computer that could actually type and compose

00:17:45.809 --> 00:17:50.809
and all of those languages were enormous in the late 70s and early 80s.

00:17:50.809 --> 00:17:54.809
I think the brothers could see that technology was changing.

00:17:54.809 --> 00:17:58.809
Things were changing from letter press to offset printing.

00:17:58.809 --> 00:18:02.809
Things were going from black and white to color.

00:18:02.809 --> 00:18:07.809
So I think all the pieces began to be there to look at the idea of maps.

00:18:07.809 --> 00:18:10.809
I kind of liken it to our moonshot.

00:18:10.809 --> 00:18:13.809
In other words, can you get there and back?

00:18:13.809 --> 00:18:17.809
Jehovah provided the right people at the right time.

00:18:17.809 --> 00:18:21.809
People who had previous expertise with building computer systems.

00:18:21.809 --> 00:18:25.809
People who had some expertise with languages.

00:18:25.809 --> 00:18:36.539
And what has always fascinated me is Jehovah's use of the timing of when to use the technologies.

00:18:36.539 --> 00:18:42.539
Jehovah put Bethel in Brooklyn and he would know at any given time.

00:18:42.539 --> 00:18:50.539
Strategically, geographically, where would be the best place for his World Headquarters?

00:18:50.539 --> 00:18:54.539
And for decades it was Brooklyn.

00:18:54.539 --> 00:18:58.539
In 1971, when you looked out over the East River,

00:18:58.539 --> 00:19:02.539
you know what you saw along the shoreline?

00:19:02.539 --> 00:19:04.539
A whole row of freighters.

00:19:04.539 --> 00:19:08.539
And then the fact that we had our printer just a few blocks away,

00:19:08.539 --> 00:19:12.539
revealed why it was beneficial to have Bethel here in Brooklyn.

00:19:12.539 --> 00:19:16.539
Now, you look out over the East River, what do you see?

00:19:16.539 --> 00:19:19.539
It's a park. You have swimming pools there.

00:19:19.539 --> 00:19:22.539
It's full of people. The purpose has changed.

00:19:22.539 --> 00:19:27.539
And the reasons for our being here have, in many ways, disappeared.

00:19:27.539 --> 00:19:31.539
Because of the way things are developing in the world,

00:19:31.539 --> 00:19:37.539
and because of Brooklyn in New York City being where it is in the world scene,

00:19:37.539 --> 00:19:41.539
it's time for us to get things moved out of Brooklyn

00:19:41.539 --> 00:19:45.539
and to a new World Headquarters where we can be even more fruitful.

00:19:45.539 --> 00:19:53.539
In 2011, Jehovah was again leading his people in another historic move.

00:19:53.539 --> 00:19:57.539
We'd like to let you know that the governing body has decided

00:19:57.539 --> 00:20:01.539
that if the approvals are received for the Warwick project,

00:20:01.539 --> 00:20:05.539
we will be moving completely out of Brooklyn.

00:20:05.539 --> 00:20:09.539
The World Headquarters will be relocated at Warwick.

00:20:09.539 --> 00:20:13.539
When it was announced, the plans of establishing World Headquarters

00:20:13.539 --> 00:20:18.539
and what is going to be in Warwick, it just seemed like it was so far away.

00:20:18.539 --> 00:20:20.539
We may not even live to that.

00:20:20.539 --> 00:20:23.539
But the time has passed quite quickly,

00:20:23.539 --> 00:20:28.539
and now it's virtually on our doorstep. It's happening.

00:20:28.539 --> 00:20:33.539
We have seen that Jehovah can use any location.

00:20:33.539 --> 00:20:36.539
We have beautiful facilities now.

00:20:36.539 --> 00:20:40.539
Walk Hill, Patterson, Soon Warwick, beautiful facilities

00:20:40.539 --> 00:20:44.539
that Jehovah will use to the fold just as you use Brooklyn.

00:20:44.539 --> 00:20:48.539
And it becomes so evident that this is not an organization of men.

00:20:48.539 --> 00:20:52.539
We're not dedicated to a building or to a city.

00:20:52.539 --> 00:20:55.539
We are dedicated to Jehovah, and when you sense his direction

00:20:55.539 --> 00:21:00.539
in this matter of relocating and doing things differently,

00:21:00.539 --> 00:21:05.539
you can't help, but okay, we back off the Sem mentality

00:21:05.539 --> 00:21:09.539
and let's go ahead and do the work as Jehovah is outlined for us today.

00:21:09.539 --> 00:21:14.539
I've always concluded when it works, Jehovah is behind it.

00:21:14.539 --> 00:21:17.539
So Warwick worked beautifully,

00:21:17.539 --> 00:21:22.539
and if you ever get to Warwick and you see Warwick as it is now,

00:21:22.539 --> 00:21:26.539
you'll say this is the place that Jehovah wanted us to be.

00:21:26.539 --> 00:21:29.539
Jehovah had Brooklyn in place,

00:21:29.539 --> 00:21:32.539
some parts of it for over a hundred years,

00:21:32.539 --> 00:21:37.539
and it served so well as a base for the governing body,

00:21:37.539 --> 00:21:42.539
as a base for printing and providing spiritual food worldwide,

00:21:42.539 --> 00:21:47.539
as a base for direction for congregations worldwide.

00:21:47.539 --> 00:21:51.539
And now, Jehovah has something else in mind,

00:21:51.539 --> 00:21:53.539
with the way things turned out,

00:21:53.539 --> 00:21:58.539
it wasn't a man or a group of men

00:21:58.539 --> 00:22:00.539
who back in the early 1900s said,

00:22:00.539 --> 00:22:02.539
you know what we need to do?

00:22:02.539 --> 00:22:04.539
We'll stay here about a hundred years,

00:22:04.539 --> 00:22:07.539
and then we'll have a place up north of the city,

00:22:07.539 --> 00:22:10.539
and we'll move there, and we'll sell all these buildings,

00:22:10.539 --> 00:22:13.539
and then it'll be a real boost to the work.

00:22:13.539 --> 00:22:16.539
No man or a group of men did that.

00:22:16.539 --> 00:22:18.539
But Jehovah and Christ Jesus,

00:22:18.539 --> 00:22:21.539
they direct the brothers at the right time in the right place

00:22:21.539 --> 00:22:25.539
to make the decisions that may seem for the present,

00:22:25.539 --> 00:22:27.539
just for the present,

00:22:27.539 --> 00:22:31.539
but Jehovah sees the end from the very beginning.

00:22:31.539 --> 00:22:34.539
Yes, World Headquarters in Brooklyn

00:22:34.539 --> 00:22:37.539
has been the hub of our global preaching work

00:22:37.539 --> 00:22:39.539
throughout the 20th century.

00:22:39.539 --> 00:22:41.539
Despite many twists and turns,

00:22:41.539 --> 00:22:44.539
Jehovah has used this location to advance his will

00:22:44.539 --> 00:22:46.539
in unprecedented ways.

00:22:46.539 --> 00:22:50.539
While we think back fondly on all that was accomplished here,

00:22:50.539 --> 00:22:52.539
we know going forward,

00:22:52.539 --> 00:22:54.539
there is only more to come.

00:22:54.539 --> 00:24:00.829
That was most interesting,

00:24:00.829 --> 00:24:02.829
but it saved your hands, there's more coming.

00:24:02.829 --> 00:24:07.460
So we're not looking back on Brooklyn,

00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:10.460
but we are moving forward,

00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:15.460
one step closer to our future hope.

00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:22.460
And as you know, I just love acronyms and abbreviations.

00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:30.460
PC, WC, WDC, LDC.

00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:35.460
But what does CPC stand for?

00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:37.460
Well, in the video,

00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:41.460
just seeing you got a glimpse of the beautiful new

00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:45.460
little city built on a lake in Warwick.

00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:50.460
So the CPC helped make that happen.

00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:53.460
What does the CPC stand for?

00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:59.869
CPC stands for construction project committee.

00:24:59.869 --> 00:25:03.309
Lock that in.

00:25:03.309 --> 00:25:07.309
Though that committee lived and breathed the Warwick project

00:25:07.309 --> 00:25:09.309
for a number of years,

00:25:09.309 --> 00:25:14.309
it was really a governing body directed project.

00:25:14.309 --> 00:25:17.309
However, the construction project committee was given the

00:25:17.309 --> 00:25:21.309
latitude to make many of the detailed,

00:25:21.309 --> 00:25:25.309
oriented decisions on their own.

00:25:25.309 --> 00:25:29.309
How did this assignment affect these brothers?

00:25:29.309 --> 00:25:35.309
Did they give it serious concern?

00:25:35.309 --> 00:25:39.309
Let's pay attention to a pre-recorded interview

00:25:39.309 --> 00:25:46.309
of the CPC conducted by Brother Harold Corcoran,

00:25:46.309 --> 00:25:49.309
a helper for the publishing committee of the governing body.

00:25:49.309 --> 00:25:55.309
The video is entitled Building for the Future.

00:25:58.009 --> 00:26:01.009
The construction of the new World Headquarters at Warwick

00:26:01.009 --> 00:26:05.009
to York was indeed a historic project.

00:26:05.009 --> 00:26:08.009
The construction project committee certainly saw evidence of

00:26:08.009 --> 00:26:11.009
Jehovah's Blessing and Guidance upon them.

00:26:11.009 --> 00:26:15.009
But they also realized that he was building more than just

00:26:15.009 --> 00:26:17.009
a new facility.

00:26:17.009 --> 00:26:23.009
He was building qualities that are so necessary for his people.

00:26:23.009 --> 00:26:27.009
And this we'll see as we talk to our CPC members.

00:26:27.009 --> 00:26:30.009
At this time, it would be good for us to introduce the

00:26:30.009 --> 00:26:32.009
construction project committee.

00:26:32.009 --> 00:26:34.009
We'll do so alphabetically.

00:26:34.009 --> 00:26:36.009
We have Brother Ken Corrin,

00:26:36.009 --> 00:26:38.009
Brother Kenneth Churnish,

00:26:38.009 --> 00:26:40.009
Brother Richard Devine,

00:26:40.009 --> 00:26:42.009
Brother Enrique Ford,

00:26:42.009 --> 00:26:44.009
and Brother Troy Snyder.

00:26:44.009 --> 00:26:48.009
One of the first questions we'd like to ask you is

00:26:48.009 --> 00:26:51.009
when you first got this assignment

00:26:51.009 --> 00:26:55.009
and you learned of the scope and all the work that was involved

00:26:55.009 --> 00:26:58.009
and the established completion date,

00:26:58.009 --> 00:27:01.009
what was your first reaction?

00:27:01.009 --> 00:27:04.009
And we'll start with Brother Richard Devine.

00:27:04.009 --> 00:27:07.009
Well, I was excited, but overwhelmed.

00:27:07.009 --> 00:27:10.009
Overwhelmed not just by the size of the project and the

00:27:10.009 --> 00:27:13.009
expedited schedule, but especially by the level of trust

00:27:13.009 --> 00:27:16.009
that the governing body had put in the five of us.

00:27:16.009 --> 00:27:19.009
I was used to recommendations being reviewed by multiple

00:27:19.009 --> 00:27:22.009
members of oversight, decisions taking weeks or months

00:27:22.009 --> 00:27:24.009
to arrive at.

00:27:24.009 --> 00:27:27.009
And here the governing body told us that we were to report

00:27:27.009 --> 00:27:29.009
only to the publishing committee.

00:27:29.009 --> 00:27:32.009
And once a budget was established to use our best judgment,

00:27:32.009 --> 00:27:35.009
carry out the work, come back to them for direction only

00:27:35.009 --> 00:27:38.009
if we exceeded our budget.

00:27:38.009 --> 00:27:41.009
Brother Troy Snyder, what would you like to add?

00:27:41.009 --> 00:27:45.009
The emotions varied from being scared to excited.

00:27:45.009 --> 00:27:48.009
And like any new assignment, you think how much work is going to be needed

00:27:48.009 --> 00:27:49.009
to accomplish it.

00:27:49.009 --> 00:27:52.009
But then when really meditating on the scope of the job

00:27:52.009 --> 00:27:56.009
and the time frame that was desired,

00:27:56.009 --> 00:27:58.009
you started to feel inadequate.

00:27:58.009 --> 00:28:01.009
And there was just no way you could do it.

00:28:01.009 --> 00:28:04.009
But then you started to realize that Jehovah was behind you.

00:28:04.009 --> 00:28:06.009
He was the one who's directing matters.

00:28:06.009 --> 00:28:09.009
He had confidence that we could do it.

00:28:09.009 --> 00:28:11.009
And so as a result, you knew you could really lean on him

00:28:11.009 --> 00:28:13.009
and look at him as a fellow worker.

00:28:13.009 --> 00:28:16.009
And that really helped set the pace.

00:28:17.009 --> 00:28:18.009
Brother Ford.

00:28:18.009 --> 00:28:22.009
First thing I realized is that if this project was going to be successful,

00:28:22.009 --> 00:28:26.009
it was going to be because of Jehovah's Holy Spirit.

00:28:26.009 --> 00:28:30.009
And that was clear because from a human perspective,

00:28:30.009 --> 00:28:32.009
it was literally impossible.

00:28:32.009 --> 00:28:35.009
But it was what Jehovah had asked us to do.

00:28:35.009 --> 00:28:39.009
And the other thing that occurred to me is that Jehovah

00:28:39.009 --> 00:28:44.009
wasn't going to bless our standard approach of developing projects.

00:28:44.009 --> 00:28:45.009
Brother Ken Korn.

00:28:45.009 --> 00:28:50.009
Well, we were living and working on the Nigeria branch construction project

00:28:50.009 --> 00:28:54.009
at Igiduma out in the beautiful Africa bush.

00:28:54.009 --> 00:28:58.009
So my first feeling was that they dial the wrong number.

00:28:58.009 --> 00:29:02.009
But within 30 minutes, we returned the phone call.

00:29:02.009 --> 00:29:06.009
We were very happy to accept the privilege to go.

00:29:06.009 --> 00:29:08.009
As far as a completion date,

00:29:08.009 --> 00:29:11.009
if we would have known all the details at that time

00:29:11.009 --> 00:29:14.009
of how warwick would be constructed,

00:29:14.009 --> 00:29:16.009
where would the faith have been?

00:29:16.009 --> 00:29:21.009
So it wasn't our assignment at that time to know all the details.

00:29:21.009 --> 00:29:26.009
It was our assignment to have faith in the invisible one, Jehovah,

00:29:26.009 --> 00:29:29.009
and move forward with that conviction.

00:29:29.009 --> 00:29:32.009
Brother Ken Korn, is what would you like to add?

00:29:32.009 --> 00:29:38.009
I could not believe that Jehovah would put that much trust in me.

00:29:38.009 --> 00:29:41.009
I'll never forget going to bed that night, laying down,

00:29:41.009 --> 00:29:46.009
eyes wide open, they remained open all night long,

00:29:46.009 --> 00:29:48.009
just praying to Jehovah.

00:29:48.009 --> 00:29:51.009
We didn't have construction documents.

00:29:51.009 --> 00:29:52.009
We didn't have permits.

00:29:52.009 --> 00:29:55.009
We didn't even have design on some of the buildings.

00:29:55.009 --> 00:29:58.009
From a seconder perspective, it couldn't be done in four years.

00:29:58.009 --> 00:30:02.009
And I realized I just needed to have the faith

00:30:02.009 --> 00:30:05.009
to follow Jehovah's lead and to work with these brothers

00:30:05.009 --> 00:30:08.009
in that schedule would become attainable.

00:30:08.009 --> 00:30:11.009
When you first started working as a committee,

00:30:11.009 --> 00:30:16.259
were there any challenges on learning how to work together as a committee?

00:30:16.259 --> 00:30:20.259
And if so, how did you address them?

00:30:20.259 --> 00:30:22.259
And we'll start with Brother Ford.

00:30:22.259 --> 00:30:25.259
I remember a visit from one governing body member,

00:30:25.259 --> 00:30:31.259
and he made a statement that they wanted this not to be a Bethel project,

00:30:31.259 --> 00:30:35.259
not to be an RBC project, but to be a CPC project,

00:30:35.259 --> 00:30:37.259
a totally different approach.

00:30:37.259 --> 00:30:42.259
So that assured me that the governing body deliberately wanted us

00:30:42.259 --> 00:30:47.259
to blend together these five different approaches and personalities.

00:30:47.259 --> 00:30:49.259
Were the Richard divine?

00:30:49.259 --> 00:30:51.259
We all brought different paradigms to the table,

00:30:51.259 --> 00:30:54.259
different ways of thinking, even a different language, in some cases.

00:30:54.259 --> 00:30:58.259
And so it took a while for us to understand each other.

00:30:58.259 --> 00:31:01.259
And so we really early on decided to try to take advantage

00:31:01.259 --> 00:31:04.259
of everything that the Brotherhood could offer,

00:31:04.259 --> 00:31:08.259
and try to blend the different approaches to achieve the success

00:31:08.259 --> 00:31:11.259
that really we were hoping for with Jehovah's Blessing.

00:31:11.259 --> 00:31:15.259
And as time went on, we really began to respect each other,

00:31:15.259 --> 00:31:18.259
and draw close together as a committee and as friends.

00:31:18.259 --> 00:31:21.259
What I appreciated was in our meetings,

00:31:21.259 --> 00:31:24.259
the brothers felt comfortable expressing themselves,

00:31:24.259 --> 00:31:27.259
and their viewpoints, even if it differed from others.

00:31:27.259 --> 00:31:30.259
My challenge was lack of Bethel experience.

00:31:30.259 --> 00:31:32.259
Still is.

00:31:32.259 --> 00:31:35.259
Yet these brothers were so patient with me,

00:31:35.259 --> 00:31:38.259
so protective of me, even.

00:31:38.259 --> 00:31:43.259
And in caring for me and understanding how much different my background was,

00:31:43.259 --> 00:31:47.259
the way I went about making decisions, the way I expressed myself.

00:31:47.259 --> 00:31:49.259
Yet they understood that.

00:31:49.259 --> 00:31:53.259
I also prayed to show honor to these brothers and to take the lead.

00:31:53.259 --> 00:31:56.259
Do a good job of it sometimes, not so good other times,

00:31:56.259 --> 00:32:01.259
but have really tried to rely on Jehovah in that way to overcome the challenge.

00:32:01.259 --> 00:32:05.259
The biggest challenge for me was myself.

00:32:05.259 --> 00:32:09.259
I could quickly see why Jehovah brought the other brothers together

00:32:09.259 --> 00:32:12.259
with their experience and construction,

00:32:12.259 --> 00:32:15.259
and engineering, business administration,

00:32:15.259 --> 00:32:18.259
many years at World Headquarters.

00:32:18.259 --> 00:32:22.259
But I felt apprehensive about my experience,

00:32:22.259 --> 00:32:26.259
even hesitant sometimes to express myself.

00:32:26.259 --> 00:32:28.259
But I kept up my spiritual routines,

00:32:28.259 --> 00:32:32.259
field service, and prayer, meditation, so forth.

00:32:32.259 --> 00:32:36.259
And in time, I realized that I needed to show more personal faith,

00:32:36.259 --> 00:32:40.259
well, specifically to show more faith in,

00:32:40.259 --> 00:32:43.259
not comparing ourselves to others,

00:32:43.259 --> 00:32:48.259
and not neglecting the gifts that we do have to offer Jehovah.

00:32:48.259 --> 00:32:51.259
So I benefited from every brother in the committee.

00:32:51.259 --> 00:32:55.259
Refined, and I'm very thankful to Jehovah for helping me grow.

00:32:55.259 --> 00:32:58.259
It's very commendable, a good example for us.

00:32:58.259 --> 00:33:06.259
Our next question, given the magnitude of this project,

00:33:06.259 --> 00:33:10.259
and the date that was established for completion,

00:33:10.259 --> 00:33:15.259
what organizational and logistical challenges

00:33:15.259 --> 00:33:19.259
did you find most daunting?

00:33:20.259 --> 00:33:21.259
Further divine?

00:33:21.259 --> 00:33:26.259
At our peak, we were processing over 11,000 requisition lines of month.

00:33:26.259 --> 00:33:30.259
We were delivering over 1,000 pallets a week to the site.

00:33:30.259 --> 00:33:32.259
It was an incredible challenge,

00:33:32.259 --> 00:33:34.259
and it really would have been impossible

00:33:34.259 --> 00:33:38.259
without Jehovah's blessing and the hard work of our procurement

00:33:38.259 --> 00:33:41.259
and purchasing departments.

00:33:41.259 --> 00:33:45.259
Designers by their training and background are used to planning.

00:33:45.259 --> 00:33:47.259
They're used to starting a project

00:33:47.259 --> 00:33:50.259
with the determination of how long would it take

00:33:50.259 --> 00:33:54.259
to get the design finish and then scheduling forward.

00:33:54.259 --> 00:33:58.259
So from day one, I realized that if we could not find a way

00:33:58.259 --> 00:34:02.259
to get the design and construction documents completed very quickly

00:34:02.259 --> 00:34:05.259
and on time, the project would grind to a halt.

00:34:05.259 --> 00:34:07.259
So that was very daunting for me.

00:34:07.259 --> 00:34:10.260
At that time, the Wallkill project was still in full swing,

00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:15.260
and they were feeding us volunteers and overseers really well

00:34:15.260 --> 00:34:18.260
when we asked for them, but there still weren't going to be enough.

00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:21.260
We were going to need to do heavy site work,

00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:24.260
simultaneous with building construction.

00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:28.260
That's not necessarily the best way to go about it.

00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:31.260
There's a lot of clashes when that happens.

00:34:31.260 --> 00:34:34.260
It makes workers less productive,

00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:37.260
because it's hard to move around the spaces.

00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:40.260
We were going to have all six major buildings

00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:42.260
and construction simultaneously.

00:34:42.260 --> 00:34:43.260
We'd come to find out.

00:34:43.260 --> 00:34:47.260
We were going to need to have 11 cranes swinging in the air.

00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:51.260
These things, along with 20 telehandlers going around the site,

00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:54.260
moving this material that Rich talked about,

00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:56.260
was going to be daunting.

00:34:56.260 --> 00:34:58.260
And, brother Kim, Karin.

00:34:58.260 --> 00:35:02.260
One aspect of my assignment was to work with safety.

00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:06.260
So it was very daunting in the beginning to imagine

00:35:06.260 --> 00:35:10.260
how will we provide safety orientation

00:35:10.260 --> 00:35:14.260
and training to thousands of volunteers coming in.

00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:18.260
And then, what would be the best way

00:35:18.260 --> 00:35:20.260
to motivate our brothers and sisters

00:35:20.260 --> 00:35:23.260
on the very serious subject of safety?

00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:27.260
And safety is a concern of all of Jehovah's people

00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:30.260
no matter what we're doing.

00:35:30.260 --> 00:35:31.260
Brother Troy Snyder.

00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:33.260
We needed the high skill.

00:35:33.260 --> 00:35:34.260
We needed the friends to come.

00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:37.260
We needed large amounts, as Brother Trunch mentioned.

00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:39.260
But how would we care for them?

00:35:39.260 --> 00:35:44.260
At one point, we grew in an eight-month period over a thousand.

00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:46.260
And we did.

00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:48.260
What type of rooming would we have for them?

00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:51.260
How would we care for them spiritually and physically?

00:35:51.260 --> 00:35:53.260
At one time, we found ourselves

00:35:53.260 --> 00:35:56.260
with a kitchen and dining room designed for 200

00:35:56.260 --> 00:35:58.260
and trying to feed about a thousand people.

00:35:58.260 --> 00:36:02.260
We certainly could feel that it was as if Jesus was in that kitchen

00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:04.260
multiplying the lows.

00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:06.260
Yeah, good support.

00:36:06.260 --> 00:36:12.539
But now you've enumerated understandable concerns,

00:36:12.539 --> 00:36:14.539
challenges.

00:36:14.539 --> 00:36:18.539
Could you give some examples on how those were resolved?

00:36:18.539 --> 00:36:21.539
And we'll be back to the current for this one.

00:36:21.539 --> 00:36:25.539
We realized that we wanted to move away

00:36:25.539 --> 00:36:29.539
from any inclination thinking that safety

00:36:29.539 --> 00:36:32.539
is somehow the first responsibility of a safety department

00:36:32.539 --> 00:36:36.539
or a safety brother coming around the check-on us.

00:36:36.539 --> 00:36:39.539
We wanted to put forth more effort

00:36:39.539 --> 00:36:45.539
to teach that safety is an expression of our spirituality.

00:36:45.539 --> 00:36:48.539
Once we started focusing on that teaching,

00:36:48.539 --> 00:36:53.539
that there are certain values such as the sanctity of life,

00:36:53.539 --> 00:36:55.539
we love our brother.

00:36:55.539 --> 00:36:59.539
We must maintain a good conscience before Jehovah.

00:36:59.539 --> 00:37:03.539
Then the whole subject of safety became very inspiring to work with.

00:37:03.539 --> 00:37:05.539
It was a real joy.

00:37:05.539 --> 00:37:08.539
In a practical way on Sunday afternoon,

00:37:08.539 --> 00:37:13.539
instead of having a three-hour safety orientation training,

00:37:13.539 --> 00:37:18.539
we developed a series of videos that could be streamed of volunteers.

00:37:18.539 --> 00:37:21.539
Before they came several weeks ahead of time,

00:37:21.539 --> 00:37:25.539
they could watch a video, take notes, watch it again if they wanted to.

00:37:25.539 --> 00:37:30.539
And what it did is it significantly increased the quality

00:37:30.539 --> 00:37:34.539
of our safety orientation and training for the entire project.

00:37:34.539 --> 00:37:40.539
We realized that we couldn't be paralyzed by fear

00:37:40.539 --> 00:37:44.539
just because we'd never done something this way before.

00:37:44.539 --> 00:37:46.539
We had to move forward with faith.

00:37:46.539 --> 00:37:49.539
An example of that was as a committee,

00:37:49.539 --> 00:37:52.539
we made the decision to model the building

00:37:52.539 --> 00:37:54.539
in three dimensions on the computer

00:37:54.539 --> 00:37:56.539
before we started construction.

00:37:56.539 --> 00:37:59.539
Now, we had never done that before,

00:37:59.539 --> 00:38:03.539
and not to speak of doing it on a project of this scale complexity

00:38:03.539 --> 00:38:05.539
with this deadline.

00:38:05.539 --> 00:38:07.539
But we moved ahead in faith,

00:38:07.539 --> 00:38:09.539
and Jehovah blessed that effort.

00:38:09.539 --> 00:38:11.539
We'd like to develop that a little bit further.

00:38:11.539 --> 00:38:15.539
You've given us some examples of how Jehovah's Holy Spirit

00:38:15.539 --> 00:38:19.539
was certainly there, his guidance, and his blessing.

00:38:19.539 --> 00:38:22.539
Could you give us some more examples of that?

00:38:22.539 --> 00:38:24.539
We'll start with Brother Churnish.

00:38:24.539 --> 00:38:27.539
A lot of decisions that were going to have to be made.

00:38:27.539 --> 00:38:29.539
What could we self-perform?

00:38:29.539 --> 00:38:32.539
What would we need to outsource to get done?

00:38:32.539 --> 00:38:34.539
In four years.

00:38:34.539 --> 00:38:38.539
And we would also come to learn through this process

00:38:38.539 --> 00:38:42.539
that if we stopped, if we prayed, if we talked about it,

00:38:42.539 --> 00:38:45.539
and if we were all in unison,

00:38:45.539 --> 00:38:48.539
we would see Jehovah's direction.

00:38:48.539 --> 00:38:50.539
It was very faith strengthening.

00:38:50.539 --> 00:38:54.539
And we would see Jehovah's Spirit work upon the contractors

00:38:54.539 --> 00:38:55.539
that were working here.

00:38:55.539 --> 00:38:56.539
They would come to us.

00:38:56.539 --> 00:39:00.539
We've never swung this many panels on a building in a day.

00:39:00.539 --> 00:39:04.539
We did 33 today. We're accustomed to doing 16.

00:39:04.539 --> 00:39:06.539
We would chuckle off on the side.

00:39:06.539 --> 00:39:08.539
We knew what they were benefiting from.

00:39:08.539 --> 00:39:11.539
Jehovah too was moving their actions

00:39:11.539 --> 00:39:14.539
because it was his will and his purpose for this to be done.

00:39:14.539 --> 00:39:17.539
So seeing this level of blessing in Holy Spirit

00:39:17.539 --> 00:39:19.539
was really faith strengthening.

00:39:19.539 --> 00:39:21.539
Troy Snyder.

00:39:21.539 --> 00:39:25.539
Early on, we received a letter from the governing body

00:39:25.539 --> 00:39:28.539
to our committee reminding us that

00:39:29.539 --> 00:39:32.539
though they wanted the project done in an expedited fashion,

00:39:32.539 --> 00:39:36.539
they didn't want it done in a way that hurt the brother spiritually.

00:39:36.539 --> 00:39:39.539
And so we started consciously making efforts

00:39:39.539 --> 00:39:43.539
to adjust one's schedules so they could attend their meetings

00:39:43.539 --> 00:39:46.539
so they could participate in the field ministry

00:39:46.539 --> 00:39:48.539
so that they would be able to benefit

00:39:48.539 --> 00:39:53.539
from all the spiritual programs that Bethel provides and has for us.

00:39:53.539 --> 00:39:57.539
We were even able to adjust some of our dear sister schedules

00:39:57.539 --> 00:40:01.539
so that they too could keep up their spiritual routine.

00:40:01.539 --> 00:40:03.539
And every time we did that,

00:40:03.539 --> 00:40:05.539
it didn't seem logical from a human standpoint

00:40:05.539 --> 00:40:08.539
but the project accelerated.

00:40:08.539 --> 00:40:10.539
Rich divine.

00:40:10.539 --> 00:40:13.539
Well, I think we've prayed more on this project

00:40:13.539 --> 00:40:16.539
than any other Theocratic project I've ever been involved with.

00:40:16.539 --> 00:40:19.539
Not only as a committee, but every department,

00:40:19.539 --> 00:40:22.539
every crew would pray together.

00:40:22.539 --> 00:40:24.539
If we talked about work, we prayed.

00:40:24.539 --> 00:40:28.539
Whether it was technical discussions or anything else,

00:40:28.539 --> 00:40:30.539
we always prayed.

00:40:30.539 --> 00:40:33.539
And it really made us feel that Jehovah was a part of our daily work

00:40:33.539 --> 00:40:35.539
that we were really fellow workers with him.

00:40:35.539 --> 00:40:37.539
And we really felt that.

00:40:37.539 --> 00:40:40.539
But also I think the most dramatic evidence of Jehovah's spirit

00:40:40.539 --> 00:40:43.539
was the manifestation of the fruitage of the spirit

00:40:43.539 --> 00:40:45.539
in our brothers and sisters.

00:40:45.539 --> 00:40:48.539
Despite long work hours, hard working conditions,

00:40:48.539 --> 00:40:52.539
difficult living conditions, an expedited schedule,

00:40:52.539 --> 00:40:55.539
you could still see the love, the hope, the joy

00:40:55.539 --> 00:40:57.539
and the brothers every day.

00:40:57.539 --> 00:41:00.539
And this really helped me to understand

00:41:00.539 --> 00:41:03.539
how Jehovah's spirit was so active here.

00:41:03.539 --> 00:41:07.539
What would you like to say to the Bethel family

00:41:07.539 --> 00:41:11.539
and to the thousands of willing, hard working volunteers

00:41:11.539 --> 00:41:14.539
that came from the field to assist you?

00:41:14.539 --> 00:41:18.539
Perhaps we can start with Ken Korn.

00:41:18.539 --> 00:41:21.539
Well, many thousands of years ago,

00:41:21.539 --> 00:41:24.539
we remember the sacrifice of Abel

00:41:24.539 --> 00:41:28.539
because out of love, he gave the best he had.

00:41:28.539 --> 00:41:32.539
So we say thank you to the brothers and sisters

00:41:32.539 --> 00:41:35.539
who supported the project out in the field.

00:41:35.539 --> 00:41:39.539
Out of love giving the best they had was often their prayers.

00:41:39.539 --> 00:41:44.539
Others came physically giving out of love the best they had.

00:41:44.539 --> 00:41:47.539
So may all the brothers and sisters remember

00:41:47.539 --> 00:41:51.539
that this was the reason they shared in the project.

00:41:51.539 --> 00:41:54.539
And it is something that they and Jehovah

00:41:54.539 --> 00:41:58.980
can remember for an eternity.

00:41:58.980 --> 00:41:59.980
Couldn't churnish.

00:41:59.980 --> 00:42:04.610
Like Brother Korn said, I would just like to say thank you.

00:42:04.610 --> 00:42:08.610
And especially to all of the brothers and sisters

00:42:08.610 --> 00:42:12.610
in the Bethel complexes in the US branch territory,

00:42:12.610 --> 00:42:17.610
they treated us like a parent would treat a child.

00:42:17.610 --> 00:42:23.610
So lovingly, they gave us everything we asked for that we needed.

00:42:23.610 --> 00:42:26.610
The friends out in the field that we've talked about them so much,

00:42:26.610 --> 00:42:31.610
they turned their lives upside down to come here and work with us.

00:42:31.610 --> 00:42:33.610
Did they benefit? Absolutely.

00:42:33.610 --> 00:42:37.610
And we so appreciate how they put up with us,

00:42:37.610 --> 00:42:41.610
how things changed, the schedules that we imputed upon them

00:42:41.610 --> 00:42:43.610
to get this work done.

00:42:43.610 --> 00:42:45.610
We know they benefited as we did

00:42:45.610 --> 00:42:48.610
and we'd like to thank them so much.

00:42:48.610 --> 00:42:50.610
Rich divine.

00:42:50.610 --> 00:42:54.610
Thank you for sacrificing your money and your time to come and help us.

00:42:54.610 --> 00:42:58.610
Thank you for interviewing and sending such capable volunteers.

00:42:58.610 --> 00:43:01.610
Thanks for working in the rain in the snow.

00:43:01.610 --> 00:43:05.610
Thanks for enduring long bus rides and living in hotels.

00:43:05.610 --> 00:43:09.610
Thanks for being our friends and thanks for the wonderful spirit

00:43:09.610 --> 00:43:13.210
that you showed through the whole project.

00:43:13.210 --> 00:43:15.210
And Ray K Ford.

00:43:15.210 --> 00:43:19.210
As we had opportunity to eat with the volunteers, work with them,

00:43:19.210 --> 00:43:24.210
travel with them, it became evident that every one of them had a story

00:43:24.210 --> 00:43:26.210
as to how they got here.

00:43:26.210 --> 00:43:31.210
Sometimes it was the supportive mate that would pick up the slack

00:43:31.210 --> 00:43:33.210
while they were here on the project.

00:43:33.210 --> 00:43:38.210
Other times they talked about their children and how their children

00:43:38.210 --> 00:43:42.210
encouraged them, supported them so that they could be here.

00:43:42.210 --> 00:43:47.210
There were even some brothers that told us about how the entire congregation

00:43:47.210 --> 00:43:52.210
supported them financially as well as covering their assignments back home

00:43:52.210 --> 00:43:57.210
because the congregation wanted to sponsor someone since they couldn't come.

00:43:57.210 --> 00:44:02.210
So we just want to thank all of those volunteers and the support

00:44:02.210 --> 00:44:04.210
that made it possible for them to come.

00:44:04.210 --> 00:44:08.130
Troy Schneider.

00:44:08.130 --> 00:44:10.130
We love you very much.

00:44:11.130 --> 00:44:15.130
And that Jehovah united us as a family and a period of time

00:44:15.130 --> 00:44:18.130
to accomplish something for his glory.

00:44:18.130 --> 00:44:23.130
And I think we personally would love to be able to express our appreciation

00:44:23.130 --> 00:44:27.130
and reward each person for what they've done.

00:44:27.130 --> 00:44:31.130
But we take such comfort in knowing that Jehovah has seen their love,

00:44:31.130 --> 00:44:36.130
seen their work, and he will reward them, and that will be a rich blessing.

00:44:36.130 --> 00:44:39.130
Thank you for those heartfelt expressions.

00:44:39.130 --> 00:44:45.820
And in conclusion, we just have a few brief comments.

00:44:45.820 --> 00:44:50.820
We have heard, and rightfully so, the governing body offer warm

00:44:50.820 --> 00:44:55.820
commendation and appreciation to all of you on this committee,

00:44:55.820 --> 00:44:59.820
as well as to the thousands who have supported the project.

00:44:59.820 --> 00:45:06.820
And at this time, we'd also like to take this opportunity to thank your wives

00:45:06.820 --> 00:45:11.820
for their hard work on this project, their patience, their endurance,

00:45:11.820 --> 00:45:14.820
and their absolute support that they gave.

00:45:14.820 --> 00:45:16.820
It's most appreciated.

00:45:16.820 --> 00:45:20.820
And I know you appreciate their support, and we do too.

00:45:20.820 --> 00:45:25.820
So the lessons that we all learned thanks to you from this project,

00:45:25.820 --> 00:45:30.820
thanks to Jehovah most of all, will benefit us now,

00:45:30.820 --> 00:45:34.820
but right on into the future, as your comments have alluded to.

00:45:34.820 --> 00:45:38.820
So once again, thank you for taking the time to share these observations.

00:45:38.820 --> 00:45:40.820
Thank you for your hard work.

00:45:40.820 --> 00:45:45.820
And it will be a privilege for all of us to continue to work shoulder to shoulder

00:45:45.820 --> 00:45:49.820
with the one who constructed all things Jehovah God.

00:45:49.820 --> 00:46:02.659
There was one word that stood out in this interview,

00:46:02.659 --> 00:46:05.659
and it was the word daunting.

00:46:05.659 --> 00:46:08.659
And of course, that is a beautiful word.

00:46:08.659 --> 00:46:11.659
It's a good word.

00:46:12.659 --> 00:46:18.659
But when you see what was accomplished in the past four years,

00:46:18.659 --> 00:46:25.659
you'll see why we're going to change the word daunting to amazing.

00:46:25.659 --> 00:46:27.659
So lock that one in.

00:46:27.659 --> 00:46:34.659
I mentioned earlier that this was a governing body directed project.

00:46:34.659 --> 00:46:40.659
CPC was indeed a unique way to expedite the construction.

00:46:40.659 --> 00:46:45.659
However, all that was accomplished on the Warwick project

00:46:45.659 --> 00:46:48.659
is a result of the base of experience.

00:46:48.659 --> 00:46:54.659
And of course, all the wonderful training that had been laid for the last several decades

00:46:54.659 --> 00:46:57.659
by the design build department.

00:46:57.659 --> 00:47:00.659
That's D-B-D.

00:47:00.659 --> 00:47:05.659
They did a lot in planning and executing construction projects around the world.

00:47:06.659 --> 00:47:13.659
And the amazing Warwick project would not have happened in that time frame

00:47:13.659 --> 00:47:17.659
without the thousands of volunteers, many of whom, for years,

00:47:17.659 --> 00:47:25.659
tirelessly assisted regional building committees are B.C.

00:47:25.659 --> 00:47:31.659
They assisted them to build so many assembly and kingdom halls month after month.

00:47:32.659 --> 00:47:37.659
And the same is true of all of the volunteers that came and assisted

00:47:37.659 --> 00:47:43.659
with the monumental expansion of the Wal-Keele branch facility.

00:47:43.659 --> 00:47:47.659
Now, would your brothers and sisters like to thank all of these ones

00:47:47.659 --> 00:48:15.409
who supported two of the largest construction projects to date?

00:48:15.409 --> 00:48:21.409
I might mention that on Friday, October the 14th, 2016,

00:48:21.409 --> 00:48:28.409
a new video about moving out of Brooklyn will be posted on JW Broadcasting.

00:48:28.409 --> 00:48:31.409
You will find it under latest videos.

00:48:31.409 --> 00:48:34.409
At the end of that video, a letter from the governing body is read,

00:48:34.409 --> 00:48:42.409
sharing sincere appreciation for all those who worked on these two construction projects.

00:48:42.409 --> 00:48:48.409
It will be posted in English first, with other languages being posted at a later time.

00:48:48.409 --> 00:48:57.409
Look for the English edition on JW Broadcasting on October the 14th, 2016.

00:48:57.409 --> 00:49:08.409
For your future or further information, the CPC was dissolved as of September the 29th, 2016.

00:49:08.409 --> 00:49:12.409
They will all be moving on to other assignments.

00:49:12.409 --> 00:49:17.409
And we appreciate very much their intense labor of love.
