00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:11.539
As we saw in Part 1, it took great faith for the Bible students to break free from the

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:18.140
darkness brought on by centuries of false religious practices, yet their challenges were far

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.140
from over.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:27.300
Jesus directed His followers to make disciples of people of all the nations, thus a huge

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:35.119
work lie ahead of the Bible students, and the time in which to do it would be limited.

00:00:35.119 --> 00:00:41.439
There would be many composers, their understanding of the scriptures would continue to grow, and

00:00:41.439 --> 00:00:44.240
their faith would be refined.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:51.039
As we will see in Part 2, the Bible students were about to experience what it would really

00:00:51.039 --> 00:01:14.879
mean to let the light shine.

00:01:14.879 --> 00:01:22.569
By 1922, the Bible students were making remarkable progress.

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:29.370
This small group had voiced their determination to advertise the king and his kingdom, to

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.840
the very ends of the earth.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.359
To spread this good news, the Bible students adopted the principal method found in God's

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:42.640
Word, from house to house.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:49.959
I remember my mother father talking about how the witness work was so emphasized then

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:54.840
about the need to visit the people of their homes, that that was the very best way of

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.840
contacting people.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:04.099
That was understood by some before, but not by the rank and file of the brothers.

00:02:04.099 --> 00:02:07.340
House to house preaching quickly became their trademark.

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.539
Good morning, we have an important message we'd like to share with you.

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:15.020
But the Bible students used a variety of methods to get their message out.

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:23.219
For instance, within two years of the start of commercial broadcasting, J.F.

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:33.699
Rutherford delivered his first of many radio discourses.

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:42.659
In 1922, the Bible students broke ground on their own radio station, W.B.B.R., New York

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:46.819
City's first non-commercial radio station.

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:50.460
It was one excellent way of reaching a lot of people.

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:56.340
We have brothers who are in the truth today, some old timers, that their first contact

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.340
with the kingdom message was on W.B.B.R.

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:06.819
By the 1930s, the Bible students were using over 400 stations to broadcast their message

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:10.810
on six continents.

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.650
Their tool for broadcasting was the sound car.

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:20.490
It was a panel truck, and we had in there a transcription machine powered by an extra

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:25.729
car battery, and we would usually drive the sound car outside of a village and then play

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:29.930
a musical record, and then with a microphone make an announcement that we were going to

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:35.169
play a Bible talk on this or that subject.

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:38.889
The first time I ever heard the truth was from a sound car.

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:44.729
In one Sunday afternoon, after dinner, my father-in-law and I went for a walk up the

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:51.370
side of one of the hills, and all the once I heard someone preaching.

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:57.449
Finally I located in the opposite side of the town, and I thought to myself, my let's

00:03:57.449 --> 00:04:03.400
clever, they could preach to the whole town.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:10.400
This led to yet another method of advertising, use of the portable phonograph.

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:17.160
It opened the lid, pushed the lever, put down the needle, and brother-father-furred would

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.560
start to speak.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:23.160
It is often said that religion is a snare and a racket, and why?

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.000
Religion had its origin with Satan, who implored religion, who reproached your whole of the

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000
almighty God.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.920
Well, if they didn't kick you off the porch, they'd get quite a message, four and a half

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:35.920
minutes.

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.720
Damn, I have something that I would really like for you to hear.

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.959
A few later years would see the development of still more methods of advertising the

00:04:42.959 --> 00:04:50.720
kingdom, placards, and information marches.

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:56.279
Of all the different faces of the work, I think that was a highlight of my life.

00:04:56.279 --> 00:04:58.120
I loved it.

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:04.720
You felt that you were in a big army, lots behind you in front of you.

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.519
It was great.

00:05:07.519 --> 00:05:11.920
I always enjoyed those information marches.

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:18.079
Regardless of the methods used, these Christians were determined to declare God's name and

00:05:18.079 --> 00:05:25.420
purpose to as many people as possible.

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:32.540
For 50 years, this group of evangelizers referred to themselves simply as Bible students.

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:38.139
But as their understanding of the scriptures increased, it seemed a different name would

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:52.269
be more appropriate.

00:05:52.269 --> 00:06:00.149
We were always just called the Bible students and brother Russell kind of encouraged that.

00:06:00.149 --> 00:06:06.910
He said, we didn't want to be known by any distinctive name, just Bible students.

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:10.350
And I appreciated his viewpoint on that.

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:16.029
The trouble was that people began to call us Russellites and Rutherfordites.

00:06:16.029 --> 00:06:20.990
Not only that, but the term Christian itself became a misnomer.

00:06:21.069 --> 00:06:27.110
Many people said there were Christians and they didn't have any ideas to what a Christian meant.

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:35.230
Their identity would be considered at a seven-day convention held in Columbus, Ohio in 1931.

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:42.110
Attendees received programs with the puzzling letters J.W. on the cover.

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:51.920
Speaking on Isaiah 43-10, J.F. Rutherford presented a resolution.

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:55.600
We have great love for Brother Charles T. Russell.

00:06:55.600 --> 00:07:02.279
And we gladly acknowledge that the Lord used him and greatly blessed his work.

00:07:02.279 --> 00:07:07.120
Yet we cannot consent to be called by the name Russellites.

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:13.040
The Watchtower Bible and Track Society and the International Bible Students Association

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:17.240
are merely names of corporations.

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:24.360
We are servants of Jehovah God, commissioned to do work in His name.

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:43.009
Henceforth, may it be known that we are Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:07:43.009 --> 00:07:51.560
Early editions of Zion's Watchtower reveal that the Bible students had already known God's name.

00:07:51.560 --> 00:08:01.160
But now, their new designation would remind these Christians that knowledge brings responsibility to bear witness.

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:11.879
So at that particular time, we went from being a vague group of persons who were joined together by a common interest in studying the Scriptures

00:08:11.879 --> 00:08:18.439
to being a scriptural identity that we could stand up and be proud of.

00:08:18.439 --> 00:08:26.680
Most of those associated with Jehovah's Witnesses prior to the 1930s felt yearnings for heavenly life.

00:08:26.759 --> 00:08:33.799
Yet the photodrama of creation had also drawn attention to Bible teachings of a paradise earth.

00:08:33.799 --> 00:08:38.039
What was the significance of such teachings?

00:08:38.039 --> 00:08:46.840
At a landmark convention in 1935, Rutherford would explain that the great multitude of Revelation chapter 7

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:51.320
is an earthly class with earthly hopes.

00:08:51.399 --> 00:08:54.840
This understanding gave fresh significance to the preaching work.

00:08:56.600 --> 00:09:01.720
Understanding that there would be a great crowd from all sorts of nations and languages

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:05.240
put a tremendous responsibility on the brothers.

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:11.240
Instead of focusing just on gathering the remaining ones of the anointed, now all of a sudden

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:17.080
there's this massive task of getting the message out to others who would then join us

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:20.639
and help us with the preaching work.

00:09:20.639 --> 00:09:26.000
Jehovah's Witnesses would continue to find new ways to let their light shine,

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:40.159
but one aspect of their message would not always be well received.

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:04.039
Jehovah's Witnesses were proclaiming that the solution to the world's problems rests with God's

00:10:04.039 --> 00:10:11.720
government. On the other hand, the churches repeatedly voiced support for human governments.

00:10:11.799 --> 00:10:19.639
Jehovah's Witnesses felt a responsibility to make people aware of the position being taken

00:10:19.639 --> 00:10:29.000
by their religious leaders. In 1938, more than 10,000 people jammed into London's Royal Albert Hall

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:35.559
to hear a pointed lecture by Joseph Rutherford, while millions more heard this stinging message by radio.

00:10:36.519 --> 00:10:42.759
Always outspoken, Rutherford invited his listeners to face the facts.

00:10:44.759 --> 00:10:50.519
The dictator of the totalitarian rule of Germany has entered into an alliance with the Pope.

00:10:51.399 --> 00:10:58.279
The indisputable facts are that the Roman Catholic hierarchy has stooped wholly to political

00:10:58.279 --> 00:11:07.240
methods to gain control of the world. Rutherford pointed to the church's role in the rise of Adolf

00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:15.000
Hitler, its alliances with fascist regimes, and its push in many nations to make Catholicism the

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:30.360
state religion. When World War II erupted in 1939, nearly every organized religion sent its

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:38.610
members into the battle. French and American Catholics killed German and Italian Catholics.

00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:47.350
British and American Protestants killed German Protestants. Jehovah's Witnesses

00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:55.240
wanted to make it clear that they were no part of this controversy. The watchtower of November

00:11:55.240 --> 00:12:03.639
1, 1939 reasoned, how could a person who is devoted to God's kingdom favor one side or the other

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:12.039
in a conflict between factions of the world? It defined what neutrality meant. We're not pacifists.

00:12:12.039 --> 00:12:19.639
Jehovah is not a pacifist, neither is his son Jesus Christ. And when it comes to being in support of

00:12:19.639 --> 00:12:25.960
some cause, we were 100% in support of the kingdom. And so we could not engage in any of the world's

00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:33.399
controversies or share in their war efforts. This stand would lead to their persecution

00:12:33.399 --> 00:12:42.600
by dictatorships and democracies around the world. This is something that is so fundamental to

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:49.720
Jehovah's people. They are absolutely no part of the world. They must be strictly neutral when

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:56.279
it comes to any conflict between the nations. There's no other people that are entirely

00:12:56.279 --> 00:13:00.360
neutral with regard to the world, but Jehovah's people are.

00:13:02.679 --> 00:13:08.759
Professed Christians who were not neutral, some who even gave voice to the teachings of Adal Hitler

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:17.970
were exposed by Jehovah's Witnesses. Their magazine, Consolation, drew attention to side-by-side

00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:24.289
comparisons of speeches aired in the United States by Catholic radio priest Charles Coglin

00:13:25.490 --> 00:13:33.490
and those written by Hitler's Chief Propaganda Minister Joseph Gabels. The wording was practically

00:13:33.490 --> 00:13:40.929
identical. Coglin's Nazi loyalties were repeatedly uncovered in the pages of Consolation,

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:50.559
but Coglin didn't appreciate that sort of publicity. His supporters stormed New York's Madison

00:13:50.559 --> 00:13:57.120
Square Garden and ranted during a speech delivered by Rutherford entitled, Government and Peace.

00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:12.629
Triton's fled from religious persecution in Europe and settled into England with the hope that

00:14:12.629 --> 00:14:19.909
they might worship God free from religious and political interference. Rutherford is speaking and

00:14:19.909 --> 00:14:29.269
the Coglinites start saying, Heil Hitler, Viva Franco, kill that damn Rutherford and he started

00:14:29.269 --> 00:14:37.440
throwing things down on stage. Well, Brother Rutherford realized what was happening and he said

00:14:38.159 --> 00:14:44.240
today the Nazis and Catholics should like to break up this meeting but by God's grace cannot do it.

00:14:58.559 --> 00:15:04.799
If Coglin's goal was to discourage Jehovah's Witnesses, then he failed utterly.

00:15:06.899 --> 00:15:13.779
The Witnesses continued to denounce religious meddling in political affairs and they took no

00:15:13.779 --> 00:15:21.940
sides in World War II and soon they would boldly proclaim a Bible prophecy that pointed to the

00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:48.039
outcome of that war. The year was 1941. Having taken the lead for 25 momentous years,

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:54.759
JF Rutherford had become seriously ill and was about to make his final public appearance.

00:15:57.220 --> 00:16:09.080
On January 8, 1942, Joseph Rutherford died. At that time, 51 nations had restricted Jehovah's

00:16:09.159 --> 00:16:19.649
Witnesses. The Second World War was raging. Some felt that these events could lead directly into

00:16:19.649 --> 00:16:30.960
Armageddon. In spite of this, in 1942, Nathan H. Nore, the one next appointed to take the lead

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:37.120
among Jehovah's Witnesses, spoke at a convention about a Bible prophecy that indicated that significant

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:46.710
events had to occur first. This international war is not the battle of the great day of God Almighty.

00:16:47.509 --> 00:16:52.070
Before Armageddon comes, the scriptures show a peace must come.

00:16:53.029 --> 00:16:58.149
There was no peace on the horizon and yet we said peace can at last.

00:16:58.950 --> 00:17:06.230
Nor set her detention on Revelation 17-8, which indicates that a figurative wild beast would come

00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:20.599
into existence, would cease to exist, but then would come back to life,

00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:25.799
nor then drew his listeners attention to the defunct League of Nations.

00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:33.400
The League is in effect in a state of suspended animation and needs to be revived

00:17:34.119 --> 00:17:39.720
if it is ever to live again. It has gone into the abyss of inaction and ineffectiveness.

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:47.799
It is not. Will the League remain in the pit? Again, the word of God gives answer.

00:17:49.079 --> 00:17:51.960
The association of worldly nations will rise again.

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:58.440
That association did rise again three years later as the United Nations.

00:18:00.039 --> 00:18:05.000
So that would indicate that there would be a time of peace after World War II.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:11.480
When we went back as pioneers after that convention, we saw that we need to get down and study with

00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:17.480
the people, educate them in the scriptures, and introduce them to the organization.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:26.759
And based largely upon their understanding of that Bible prophecy in that very year, 1942,

00:18:27.559 --> 00:18:31.400
Jehovah's Witnesses made plans to expand their preaching work.

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:38.680
Rather than thinking of, well, we're going to stop this work. No, there was a field opening up,

00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:43.960
and there was a window of opportunity for us to give a tremendous witness. How long it would last?

00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:45.480
None of us knew.

00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:47.880
First Peter, chapter 3, verse 15.

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:51.640
To prepare Jehovah's Witnesses for this new field of activity,

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:56.599
nor, and his staff designed the Watchtower Bible College of Gillian,

00:18:57.160 --> 00:19:00.759
which would train full-time ministers for missionary service.

00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:05.480
That is in you, yet with meekness and fear.

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:08.839
They also conceived the Course in Theocratic Ministry,

00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:13.079
which would equip individual ministers to share their beliefs.

00:19:13.079 --> 00:19:15.799
That was an excellent example.

00:19:15.799 --> 00:19:20.279
They could speak from the heart, they could go to their Bibles, share these scriptures,

00:19:20.279 --> 00:19:26.119
so they would have that kind of training now to represent Jehovah in a much more powerful way.

00:19:26.599 --> 00:19:32.359
This education did more than help witnesses to overcome fear of public speaking.

00:19:32.359 --> 00:19:35.720
It strengthened their congregations,

00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:41.640
and it prepared them to give a bold witness in an even greater setting.

00:19:41.640 --> 00:20:01.809
Jehovah's Witnesses try to obey the government and the laws of the land in every aspect of life,

00:20:01.809 --> 00:20:06.769
but the one aspect of life that they realize that the governments cannot control

00:20:07.009 --> 00:20:08.930
is our worship of God.

00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:12.609
If the government says you cannot preach the message,

00:20:13.329 --> 00:20:17.009
it doesn't take much research in the Bible to see that the apostles

00:20:17.009 --> 00:20:19.170
had the same command given to them,

00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:24.849
and they gave very clear answers when they say we obey God as ruler rather than men.

00:20:26.130 --> 00:20:28.369
Jesus had forewarned his disciples,

00:20:29.170 --> 00:20:31.569
men will deliver you up to local courts.

00:20:32.450 --> 00:20:35.490
While preaching from house to house,

00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:41.170
Newton can't well and his sons were arrested for conducting their ministry without the approval of the state.

00:20:42.529 --> 00:20:44.769
The witnesses challenged the conviction.

00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:49.809
Not defiant, but simply peacefully saying,

00:20:49.809 --> 00:20:52.930
no, Jehovah has commanded us to do this,

00:20:52.930 --> 00:20:58.769
and we're not going to ask a human for permission to do that which Jehovah has commanded us to do.

00:20:59.730 --> 00:21:05.009
After a two-year battle, the court decided in favor of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:21:06.289 --> 00:21:09.569
But just two weeks after the Cantwell decision,

00:21:09.569 --> 00:21:16.609
the United States Supreme Court would decide another case involving Jehovah's Witnesses and the national flag.

00:21:17.569 --> 00:21:23.170
Although we respect totally the nation and what the flag represents,

00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:27.250
to make an act of devotion or worship to a flag

00:21:28.049 --> 00:21:31.730
is in the same category to us as worshiping an idol.

00:21:33.009 --> 00:21:37.650
Thousands of witness-school children were expelled because they would not salute.

00:21:38.450 --> 00:21:45.730
Among them, William and Lillian Gobitis, the witnesses challenged the expulsion in court.

00:21:47.089 --> 00:21:52.369
Then when the time came for the trial, that was very frightening.

00:21:52.369 --> 00:21:54.450
Raise your right hand, put your left hand on the Bible.

00:21:55.250 --> 00:21:57.650
You solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth,

00:21:57.650 --> 00:21:59.490
and nothing but the truth, so help you God.

00:21:59.490 --> 00:22:00.289
I do.

00:22:00.289 --> 00:22:02.769
Bill was the first one to go and stand.

00:22:02.769 --> 00:22:05.250
They asked him, why don't you salute the flag?

00:22:05.250 --> 00:22:07.170
And he brought out X's, 20.

00:22:08.210 --> 00:22:11.250
They were, it was my turn, they asked the same, and I said,

00:22:11.250 --> 00:22:14.130
the Bible is clear at first John 521,

00:22:14.130 --> 00:22:17.410
where it says, little children, keep yourselves from idols.

00:22:17.410 --> 00:22:21.650
Although the lower courts decided in favor of Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:22:21.650 --> 00:22:22.529
courts adjourned.

00:22:26.150 --> 00:22:30.230
The school board fought back and appealed to the Supreme Court.

00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:38.789
On June 3, 1940, the Supreme Court ruled 8 to 1 against Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:22:40.069 --> 00:22:42.309
a ruling that would rock the country.

00:22:46.279 --> 00:22:51.960
Within days of the Gobitis decision, the Kingdom Hall in Kenobunk, Maine, was torched.

00:22:54.579 --> 00:22:58.660
In Illinois, a mob attacked witnesses as they were preaching.

00:22:59.619 --> 00:23:04.339
Turning over their cars and destroying their literature.

00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:12.789
In Winsboro, Texas, witness Oscar Pillars was attacked by a mob

00:23:12.789 --> 00:23:15.349
that was determined to make him salute the flag.

00:23:26.339 --> 00:23:30.180
They brought me to them by now, they had the flag there,

00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:32.259
and they wanted me to salute that.

00:23:32.259 --> 00:23:36.259
They would hold up my hand in this place and then I'd let my hand drop.

00:23:37.299 --> 00:23:39.299
And of course, that made them very angry.

00:23:41.650 --> 00:23:44.130
The mob threw the rope over a pipe,

00:23:45.730 --> 00:23:47.730
and then pulled Pillars up.

00:24:02.519 --> 00:24:05.880
He woke up in jail and near death.

00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:13.400
The next thing I knew was a doctor was bringing me to the marshal said,

00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:16.440
and this put great courage back into me.

00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:21.319
The marshal said, he is the most stubborn devil I've ever seen in my life.

00:24:21.319 --> 00:24:26.119
So I knew then that I had not compromised.

00:24:26.119 --> 00:24:32.119
Some were tarred and feathered, others were run out of town, several were castrated,

00:24:32.119 --> 00:24:35.319
and this was not just from one or two communities,

00:24:35.319 --> 00:24:39.960
but literally from Maine to California, from Washington to Georgia.

00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:46.599
In Opalika, Alabama, witness Thelma Jones, and later her husband, Roscoe,

00:24:46.599 --> 00:24:50.920
were arrested and unjustly convicted of selling books without a license.

00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:56.119
The US Supreme Court upheld their conviction five to four.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:01.480
The Supreme Court ruled that the state, in this case the city of Opalika,

00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:08.599
had the right to impose a fee and a permit for the so-called privilege of talking to one's

00:25:08.599 --> 00:25:13.000
neighbor. Yet in the defeat, there lay a glimmer of hope.

00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:18.759
Descenting justice's Douglas Murphy and Black stated that the Jones case,

00:25:18.759 --> 00:25:23.160
and the earlier Gobitis Flags salute case, were wrongly decided.

00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:27.829
Jehovah's Witnesses saw their opportunity.

00:25:29.029 --> 00:25:31.750
They forged ahead with a new Flags salute case.

00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:33.910
Or by the Covington, it looks like we're ready to go to trial.

00:25:34.789 --> 00:25:37.910
West Virginia State Board of Education versus Barnett.

00:25:39.589 --> 00:25:44.549
In the Barnett case, the court reversed itself overturning the decision in Gobitis.

00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:49.750
The court ruled that the school board has no right to deny education

00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:53.509
to children of Jehovah's Witnesses who refused to salute the flag.

00:25:55.640 --> 00:26:02.119
In that one year, 1943, the United States Supreme Court rendered 21 decisions

00:26:02.119 --> 00:26:10.900
favorable to Jehovah's Witnesses. Meanwhile, witnesses in the province of Quebec, Canada,

00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:14.740
were being arrested regularly, sometimes twice a day.

00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:22.579
Quebec's head of state, Premier Maurice de Placé, made it his personal ambition to silence

00:26:22.579 --> 00:26:26.420
Jehovah's Witnesses, but his efforts backfired.

00:26:27.779 --> 00:26:34.180
After a 12-year battle, the Canadian Supreme Court convicted Duplacé for his harassment of

00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:41.779
Jehovah's Witnesses. The condemnation of the premiere of a province was unprecedented in Canadian

00:26:41.779 --> 00:26:51.799
history, and it was hailed as a landmark for individual freedom. Legal battles were not limited

00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:59.799
to North America. In Greece, some 20,000 arrests were carried out against Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:27:02.079 --> 00:27:08.960
Over a period of 48 years, Minos Coconakis was arrested more than 60 times for preaching.

00:27:11.519 --> 00:27:14.720
He spent years in prison and in exile.

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:22.079
If I was keeping a book, how could I write it? One, two, three, five, ten, many times I was

00:27:22.079 --> 00:27:29.680
in prison and exile. That was a whole life, 50 years. They sentenced us deliberately and

00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:37.859
premeditated. Finally, in 1993, the European Court of Human Rights upheld the right of a

00:27:37.859 --> 00:27:45.140
Greek citizen to teach his religious beliefs to others. And ruled that Greece had violated the

00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:53.380
freedom of Minos Coconakis. To date, Jehovah's Witnesses have won over 200 favourable decisions.

00:27:53.460 --> 00:28:00.049
In the highest courts on earth. Burning deep within the hearts of Jehovah's Witnesses is a

00:28:00.049 --> 00:28:06.849
desire to show Jehovah how much we love him. As secular authorities attempt to impede our effort,

00:28:06.849 --> 00:28:11.890
then with that same degree of zeal, we work to protect our witnessing activities.

00:28:12.609 --> 00:28:19.730
To know that if you put your trust in Jehovah, he will help you through it no matter what.

00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:29.970
The wonderful thing about persecution, if I can call it that, is that it demands. It demands a firm

00:28:29.970 --> 00:28:37.009
decision. Jehovah is a powerful fighter who can fight with him. No matter how much opposition we

00:28:37.009 --> 00:28:45.250
may face, or what form or shape it may take, our trust in Jehovah will never let us down.

00:28:45.970 --> 00:29:00.559
He's backing us up. Throughout the legal battles and persecution,

00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:13.329
Jehovah's Witnesses were experiencing amazing growth. The School of Gilead was making an impact.

00:29:15.859 --> 00:29:22.099
In the first 10 years of its operation, over 2,000 missionaries had been trained and dispatched.

00:29:25.089 --> 00:29:35.000
And the number of Jehovah's Witnesses quadrupled. In Africa, in just 11 years after the start

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:45.509
of the Gilead School, the number of Jehovah's Witnesses increased by 800%. The message took hold

00:29:45.509 --> 00:29:53.990
in the Orient as well. When Gilead Missionaries arrived in Japan in 1949, there were fewer than 10

00:29:53.990 --> 00:30:02.710
native Witnesses. But in less than 50 years, that number would multiply to over 200,000.

00:30:03.349 --> 00:30:12.150
Most definitely, it's not the result of human efforts, but it's the result of Jehovah's Spirit.

00:30:12.150 --> 00:30:17.990
It's true he uses humans. He blesses their efforts, but it's God who makes it grow.

00:30:19.990 --> 00:30:36.319
Worldwide, Jehovah's Witnesses were preaching in 143 countries. The work was expanding on every

00:30:36.319 --> 00:30:53.440
continent. The witnesses were growing, not just in number, but in understanding. Since the days of

00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:59.440
CT Russell, Jehovah's Witnesses had been using Bible translations accepted in the various lands in

00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:12.470
which they preached. But there were a number of problems, antiquated language, the presence of

00:31:12.470 --> 00:31:21.829
spurious texts. And the fact that most translators had replaced the name of God, Jehovah, with titles,

00:31:21.829 --> 00:31:29.190
such as Lord or God. It's just as if you're reading a letter about a personal friend someone

00:31:29.190 --> 00:31:34.470
you love, and their name's not in there. It just talks about the man or the person.

00:31:35.029 --> 00:31:41.829
And so the need was seen to have a translation where the name Jehovah is mentioned everywhere,

00:31:41.829 --> 00:31:49.109
where it used to be in the original writing. In 1946, Jehovah's Witnesses began work on a new

00:31:49.109 --> 00:31:57.269
translation of the Bible. The Egyptian papyri, the Dead Sea Scrolls, and other recent archaeological

00:31:57.269 --> 00:32:05.750
findings helped make possible the full restoration of God's name. The results of years of painstaking

00:32:05.750 --> 00:32:09.349
labor began to be revealed in 1950.

00:32:09.349 --> 00:32:19.890
By Jehovah's undeserved kindness, I have the extreme pleasure of releasing to the international

00:32:19.890 --> 00:32:27.009
theocracy's increase assembly of Jehovah's Witnesses, the new world translation of the Christian

00:32:27.009 --> 00:32:40.470
Greek scriptures. The new world translation is the first to render the divine name consistently

00:32:40.549 --> 00:32:51.829
from Matthew to Revelation 237 times. Restoring God's name to each of the places where it had been

00:32:51.829 --> 00:32:58.549
removed didn't always set well with the critics. But you can't do that, said one of the critics.

00:32:59.589 --> 00:33:08.869
The committee in its forward of 29 pages shows how it can be done on valid grounds and it does it.

00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:28.200
After World War II, nations were beginning to recover economically,

00:33:29.559 --> 00:33:36.720
but not spiritually or morally. Jehovah's Witnesses took steps to make sure their

00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:44.000
conduct was in harmony with the standard set forth in the Bible. Since 1945,

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:52.680
Jehovah's Witnesses have upheld the Bible's command to abstain from blood. In the 1950s,

00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:57.079
though many were adopting a more tolerant view of sex outside of marriage,

00:33:57.079 --> 00:34:00.759
Jehovah's Witnesses held that such conduct should be shunned.

00:34:02.279 --> 00:34:07.720
And it was pointed out about that time that one could not be qualified to have a responsibility

00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:12.599
in the congregation if they hadn't a clean standing before God.

00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:17.719
Well, I remember some brothers were saying, oh, that'll never work and we'll never have enough

00:34:17.719 --> 00:34:23.719
congregation overseers to do the job. But a brother nor and their other responsible brothers

00:34:23.719 --> 00:34:29.159
determined that we were going to maintain Bible standards regardless of the consequences.

00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:36.760
Since 1952, Jehovah's Witnesses have adhered to the Bible teaching that those who practice

00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:47.829
conduct condemned by God should be disfellowshipped. Then in 1973, although many considered the use of

00:34:47.829 --> 00:34:55.670
tobacco to be a personal choice, Jehovah's Witnesses rejected it outright as a form of drug abuse.

00:34:56.949 --> 00:35:02.710
They were willing to uphold these scriptural standards, even if it didn't win them any popularity.

00:35:04.150 --> 00:35:07.670
Sure, you could relax the standard and you could perhaps attract a lot more people.

00:35:08.550 --> 00:35:13.750
But Jehovah's never been primarily interested in numbers, but he's interested in quality

00:35:14.469 --> 00:35:17.750
of his worshipers. Only eight survived the flood.

00:35:18.469 --> 00:35:20.949
It shows you that Jehovah's thinking on numbers.

00:35:32.679 --> 00:35:38.119
For years, organizational matters were largely in the hands of the president of the Watchtower

00:35:38.119 --> 00:35:46.469
Bible and Track Society of Pennsylvania. But in the 1970s, a concerted effort was made to align

00:35:46.469 --> 00:35:49.989
the organization more closely with the pattern in the Bible.

00:35:50.949 --> 00:35:55.190
And so if there was no number one in the first century among the apostles,

00:35:56.550 --> 00:36:02.070
why should there be a number one today? But the pattern of the first century is a collective

00:36:03.190 --> 00:36:05.190
direction of the organization.

00:36:06.389 --> 00:36:11.909
This collective direction is given by a group of men who serve as the governing body

00:36:11.909 --> 00:36:20.639
of Jehovah's Witnesses. This adjustment has enabled Jehovah's Witnesses to do their work more

00:36:20.639 --> 00:36:39.199
effectively. They are building houses of worship faster than ever before. They are publishing

00:36:39.199 --> 00:36:56.480
Bible literature in more than 500 languages and either printed or electronic form.

00:37:03.110 --> 00:37:10.710
Jehovah's Witnesses are convinced that this system of things is deep into its last days.

00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:21.860
And the governing body is intent on reaching as many people as possible with the knowledge of God.

00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:28.659
We want to continue to oversee and give impetus to the preaching work,

00:37:29.380 --> 00:37:34.980
because this has to be done before the end comes. Mark 1310. In all the nations,

00:37:35.619 --> 00:37:41.619
the good news has to be preached first. Jesus said that we can have more confidence in the

00:37:41.619 --> 00:37:45.940
fulfillment of the Bible and the sun coming up. And so with that kind of faith, we can do the work.

00:37:45.940 --> 00:37:50.659
It's involved. We just pour ourselves into that. It would be impossible for humans to do

00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:57.699
what Jehovah accomplished. We have to give them full credit for the things that have transpired.

00:37:58.340 --> 00:38:05.219
And we also realize that we've got to work to complete. So keeping our brothers and sisters focused

00:38:05.219 --> 00:38:11.059
on what Jehovah wants us to do at this particular time, seeing how close the end is,

00:38:11.059 --> 00:38:16.739
that is our main focus, and giving full support to the brotherhood as they continue to show their

00:38:16.739 --> 00:38:20.579
love for Jehovah, to preach that good news and all the inhabited earth.

00:38:20.579 --> 00:38:26.980
What I see in the modern history of Jehovah's Witnesses, here is a people who were hungry for the truth,

00:38:27.780 --> 00:38:34.659
who were humble and who wanted to do Jehovah's will. They have deep love for God and a desire

00:38:34.659 --> 00:38:39.380
to see Jehovah's name sanctified to the ends of the earth.

00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:44.820
What started as a small group of sincere Bible students

00:38:46.900 --> 00:38:50.500
has grown into millions of preachers throughout the earth.

00:38:58.579 --> 00:39:02.260
What began with little international or ethnic diversity

00:39:04.519 --> 00:39:19.510
has grown into a worldwide brotherhood united in the worship of the one true God,

00:39:19.510 --> 00:39:30.320
Jehovah. Bible education is still the means by which they receive the light.

00:39:33.170 --> 00:39:37.170
They understand that what they learn from the Bible today

00:39:40.420 --> 00:39:49.250
will strengthen their faith for the days ahead. Those who accept the light

00:39:50.289 --> 00:40:11.760
become disciples. As true disciples, Jehovah's Witnesses have had to accept hardship,

00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:25.440
but no hardship can diminish their joy. Their perseverance through all manner of tribulations

00:40:26.159 --> 00:40:33.679
is evidence that their faith is not misplaced and that the God they worship is real.

00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:55.219
