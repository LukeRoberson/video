00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:06.230
There is a god in the heavens who is a revealer of secrets

00:00:07.269 --> 00:00:12.789
And he has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar what is to happen in the final part of the day

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:22.010
The divine dream the Daniel interprets for King Nebuchadnezzar

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:25.329
constitutes a prophecy

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:28.329
Crucial for the lasting peace of mankind

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.689
Jehovah knows the course of history centuries even Millenniums in advance and

00:00:34.009 --> 00:00:38.689
And as the toes of the feet were partly of iron and partly of clay

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.289
So the kingdom will be partly strong and partly fragile

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:53.259
History has shown us how every type of human government imaginable has failed

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:59.420
It's only Jehovah who has the ability to guide humans to real lasting peace

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.450
He has led his people in the past

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:11.849
So when he prophesies that he'll lead his people to real lasting peace in the future

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.450
This is in a prediction

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.450
It's a guarantee

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.569
The peace we seek is certain under God's Kingdom
