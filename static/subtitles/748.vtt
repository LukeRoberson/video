00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:05.299
Do you want to be loved by others?

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:06.299
Naturally.

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.300
We all want to be loved.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.300
Love is a basic human need.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.300
Babies thrive on it.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:15.300
Teenagers thrive on it.

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.300
Marriage mates thrive on it.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.300
Patholites and Gilead students thrive on it.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.300
It makes us happy to be loved.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.300
What about loving others?

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.300
Love is unselfish.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.300
Loving others makes the receivers happy,

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.299
but it also makes us as givers happy.

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:39.299
Love is the reason why we exist.

00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:43.299
Jehovah created us out of unselfish love

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:45.299
to let us share not only life,

00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:48.299
but also the privilege to love him.

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:53.299
Jehovah does not need our love since he does not depend on anybody else,

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:56.299
but he appreciates our love.

00:00:56.299 --> 00:01:00.299
He loves to be loved by us.

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:05.299
He created us also with the ability to love others besides him.

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:08.299
We love to do good to others.

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:11.299
We love to love them.

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:14.299
Since when does love exist?

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:17.299
It always existed.

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:20.299
It had no beginning.

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:21.299
Why?

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.299
Because God is love, and we know God had no beginning.

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:30.299
So God's love had no beginning.

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.299
There was no time in the past when God existed, but love did not.

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:42.299
Jehovah not only has love, but he is love personified.

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.299
Jehovah created us in his image.

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:51.299
This is why we have the superb privilege to reflect his love.

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:56.299
In the world, books, movies, and songs often deal with love.

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:58.299
But what kind of love?

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:03.299
Usually romantic love, love that often fails.

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:08.300
Genuine love of God and of neighbor is widely lacking today.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:14.300
When describing the last days the prophecy at 2 Timothy 3 verse 2

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.300
has come true that people are often lovers of themselves.

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:24.300
Me isn't meant, egotism is widespread.

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.300
One journal carries the title self.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:33.300
People think, first me, then nothing, and then me again,

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.300
and then perhaps somebody else.

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:43.300
In 2 Timothy 3 too Paul also wrote that people would be lovers of money.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:49.300
In the same prophecy it says the majority would be lovers of pleasures

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.300
rather than lovers of God.

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:59.300
For many entertainment and sports have become the dominant aspect of their lives.

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:06.300
Furthermore, first John 2.15 indicates there is a battle between two loves,

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.300
love of Jehovah and love of the world.

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:17.300
The stronger our love for Jehovah is, the better we will be able to resist the love of the world.

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:27.300
At Matthew 22.37 Jesus encouraged cultivating love for God to the fullest extent possible.

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:36.300
You must love Jehovah your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole mind.

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:40.580
How does love for Jehovah grow?

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:47.580
We must tend to the good soil of our heart where the seed of kingdom truth was sown.

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.580
How does love between two persons grow?

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:54.580
One way is by communication.

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.580
We communicate with Jehovah through prayer.

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:04.580
Jehovah communicates with us through the Bible and his organization.

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:11.580
If we study the Bible and read it daily as well as attend the congregation meetings,

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.819
our love for him will continue to grow.

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:18.819
Love needs to grow.

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:25.819
It is not a matter of how much we know, but how much we love what we know.

00:04:25.819 --> 00:04:28.819
Head knowledge is not enough.

00:04:28.819 --> 00:04:32.819
There needs to be heart knowledge.

00:04:32.819 --> 00:04:37.819
Growing in love is a process, a plant grows when it is watered.

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:41.819
Love grows if it is watered with the water of truth.

00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:46.819
In Philippians chapter 1 verse 9, Paul says,

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:54.819
and this is what I continue praying that your love may abound yet more and more.

00:04:55.819 --> 00:04:57.819
Love grows gradually.

00:04:57.819 --> 00:05:00.819
It is not enough to have a little love.

00:05:00.819 --> 00:05:03.819
We should abound in love.

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:05.819
Jehovah sets the example.

00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:09.819
He expressed his love by providing the ransom.

00:05:09.819 --> 00:05:16.819
In Matthew chapter 18, Jesus compares Jehovah with a king who was willing to forgive

00:05:16.819 --> 00:05:23.819
a debt of 60 million dinarii or 10,000 silver talents.

00:05:23.819 --> 00:05:27.819
This certainly impresses his love for us.

00:05:27.819 --> 00:05:32.819
Jesus expressed his love by being willing to die for our sins.

00:05:32.819 --> 00:05:35.819
This stirs our love in return.

00:05:35.819 --> 00:05:40.819
The more one has been forgiven, the more one will love.

00:05:40.819 --> 00:05:44.819
But love is not dependent on having one sins forgiven.

00:05:44.819 --> 00:05:52.819
Jesus loved Jehovah so much but had not a single sin that needed to be forgiven.

00:05:52.819 --> 00:05:56.819
But he loved Jehovah and he loved us.

00:05:56.819 --> 00:06:01.819
The night before he died, he said at John 1431,

00:06:01.819 --> 00:06:04.819
I love the Father.

00:06:04.819 --> 00:06:08.819
Do we not all of us feel the same?

00:06:08.819 --> 00:06:14.819
How can we demonstrate our love of God in return?

00:06:14.819 --> 00:06:19.819
We can do so by serving Jehovah with all our heart.

00:06:19.819 --> 00:06:23.819
This includes preaching and teaching.

00:06:23.819 --> 00:06:25.819
True or false?

00:06:25.819 --> 00:06:30.819
The most important reason for preaching and teaching is love of neighbor.

00:06:30.819 --> 00:06:34.819
It sounds good but it is wrong.

00:06:34.819 --> 00:06:40.819
The most important motive for preaching is first of all love for Jehovah

00:06:40.819 --> 00:06:46.819
and the most important objective is to praise Jehovah.

00:06:46.819 --> 00:06:52.819
We want to glorify him and to support the vindication of his sovereignty.

00:06:52.819 --> 00:06:55.819
Love of neighbor comes second.

00:06:55.819 --> 00:06:58.819
But we also need to show love to our brothers.

00:06:58.819 --> 00:07:06.819
In one congregation, several sisters took daily turns to prepare a hot meal for a quadriplegic brother.

00:07:06.819 --> 00:07:11.819
This shows that our love extends beyond preaching.

00:07:11.819 --> 00:07:18.819
It is like with the parable of the Samaritan who cared for the man that was assaulted and hurt by robbers.

00:07:18.819 --> 00:07:23.819
The Samaritan did not preach to the man who fell among the robbers.

00:07:23.819 --> 00:07:27.819
He just showed unselfish love to him.

00:07:27.819 --> 00:07:33.819
Jesus emphasized that our neighborly love should include even enemies.

00:07:33.819 --> 00:07:37.819
In Matthew 5, 44, he said,

00:07:37.819 --> 00:07:46.620
I say to you, continue to love your enemies and to pray for those persecuting you.

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:51.620
Our love will be perfect if we love even our enemies.

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:56.620
Jehovah gives sunshine and rain even to wicked opposers.

00:07:56.620 --> 00:08:01.620
One publisher went to a hospital to visit an opposing husband.

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:07.620
The man appreciated this kind gesture very much.

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:10.620
Think of what Jesus has endured.

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:15.620
He was hated without cause, persecuted, reviled and murdered.

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:22.620
Help people to develop their appreciation for what Jesus did for us.

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:32.620
Show interested ones that because of the ransom, Jehovah forgives us our sins and opens the way to everlasting life.

00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:37.620
When you talk about the ransom, don't do it just in a legalistic way by saying,

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:43.620
see, like on scales, on one side was Adam and on the other side was Jesus.

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:49.620
God's justice required that by giving his life Jesus restored what Adam had lost.

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:57.620
Rather, make the student meditate and develop heart appreciation and love for what Jesus did.

00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:02.620
Review with the student what Jesus went through prior to his execution.

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:10.620
Help him picture in his mind how Jesus was flagged, producing clear-roaring ribbons of bleeding flesh.

00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:14.620
Help the student sense how Jesus was mocked.

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:20.620
After his tortured beating, soldiers said to him mockingly,

00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:24.620
good day, you king of the Jews.

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:28.620
Also, they spit on him and slapped him in the face.

00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:36.990
Remind the student how the soldiers later pounded large nails into his hands and into his feet.

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:45.990
With the stakes swung upright, the pain was excruciating for the weight of the body toer all the nail wounds.

00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:50.990
Yet, rather than threaten Jesus' prey for the Roman soldiers,

00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:57.460
father forgive them for they do not know what they are doing.

00:09:57.460 --> 00:10:05.460
Meditating on what Jesus did for us, does this not greatly deepen our love for him?

00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:13.460
At Division 319 Paul wrote, the love of the Christ surpasses knowledge.

00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:20.460
It is not the love for the Christ, but the love that Jesus displayed that surpasses head knowledge

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:25.809
and strikes a wonderful court in our figurative heart.

00:10:25.809 --> 00:10:28.809
Jesus' chorus stimulates a response in us.

00:10:28.809 --> 00:10:34.809
As we think about what Christ has done for us, our love for him deepens.

00:10:34.809 --> 00:10:42.809
In fact, Second Corinthians 514 says, for the love the Christ has compels us.

00:10:43.809 --> 00:10:51.809
After mentioning gifts of the Spirit such as healing and speaking in tongues, Paul explained that 1 Corinthians 1231,

00:10:51.809 --> 00:10:56.809
yet I show you a surpassing way.

00:10:56.809 --> 00:11:01.809
What is this way? The way of love?

00:11:01.809 --> 00:11:04.809
In what way is it surpassing?

00:11:04.809 --> 00:11:10.809
In the sense that the gifts of the Spirit, including prophesying, would be done away with.

00:11:10.809 --> 00:11:18.809
But love would always be there. Jehovah is eternal. His love will never fail.

00:11:18.809 --> 00:11:25.809
Never end, but will continue forever and ever and ever.

00:11:25.809 --> 00:11:31.809
Therefore Paul wrote, there remained faith, hope, love, these three.

00:11:31.809 --> 00:11:35.809
But the greatest of these is love.

00:11:36.809 --> 00:11:43.809
He also wrote, love never fails. Love endures all things.

00:11:43.809 --> 00:11:49.809
Many brothers suffered a lot during World War II and today in Russia and other countries.

00:11:49.809 --> 00:11:54.809
Today there are a number of governments in the world that suppress the truth.

00:11:54.809 --> 00:11:58.809
As we live in the time of the end, this is not surprising to us.

00:11:58.809 --> 00:12:02.809
It will get worse as the Great Tribulation comes closer.

00:12:02.809 --> 00:12:10.809
World conditions also get worse in many parts of the world, and COVID has claimed many human victims.

00:12:10.809 --> 00:12:19.809
But we witnesses keep enduring by pursuing the surpassing way of love that never fails.

00:12:19.809 --> 00:12:25.809
We shall not only live forever, but also love forever and be loved forever.
