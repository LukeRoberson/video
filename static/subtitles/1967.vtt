00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:24.539
I develop with other colleagues criteria on how to perform surgery without blood transfusion

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.780
in case of believer transplant, or in case of kidney transplant.

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:36.939
And we have also come up with plans how to perform surgery, liver reduction, for example,

00:00:36.939 --> 00:00:38.539
without blood transfusion.

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:43.859
There are several issues to take into consideration.

00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:52.979
The number one should be how a surgeon is approaching a widest patient in the situation

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:56.979
to perform a potential complex surgery.

00:00:56.979 --> 00:01:06.219
And the mental attitude should be the one to say this patient, like every other, needs

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:11.180
a procedure that will be eventually be curative.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.500
This should be the second approach.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:24.379
Being aware that most of the time a very competent surgeon does not use blood, so that should

00:01:24.379 --> 00:01:31.140
give the surgeon the reasonable confidence that he can perform the surgery without blood.

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:40.219
The third point is that, of course, the surgeon should use criteria on which patient

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:51.000
he can definitely perform a surgery without blood transfusion at all.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.079
I don't think we can make a differentiation on religion ground.

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:02.040
There are even patients that are not with us that don't want blood transfusion.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.000
Besides, transfusion is not always a treatment.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:14.400
It's ancillary support to be provided to the patient while he's receiving the correct

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.680
procedure.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:32.719
If I can do a complex procedure on a widest patient, preparing him with a nice protocol of

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:35.120
blood growth factor.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:43.080
And then having a judicious infusion of fluids after the procedure, and so I can avoid blood

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.039
transfusion on this patient, I can use the same modes for all the other.

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:49.520
Everybody can take an advantage of that.
