00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:04.309
Satan is the main peace-recker.

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:08.230
The scriptures tell us that he is driven by great anger.

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:12.429
His anger is malicious and uncontrolled.

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:19.030
Would any sound-minded God-fearing person allow himself to reflect Satan's vicious anger?

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:20.589
Of course not.

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:27.429
That is why all true servants of God are determined to put away uncontrolled anger.

00:00:27.629 --> 00:00:32.229
But apart from uncontrolled anger, is all anger bad?

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:35.469
The Bible does not condemn all anger.

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:41.109
It teaches us that anger is wrong when it is uncontrolled or unjustified.

00:00:41.109 --> 00:00:48.149
At Ephesians 4.26, God's Word tells us to be wrathful, but it adds do not sin.

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:54.710
At times, anger may simply be a strong feeling that comes into us because of being upset or annoyed

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.509
by something that we see as being wrong.

00:00:58.509 --> 00:01:01.590
That in itself is not bad.

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.129
But what makes anger bad is when it fills a person's heart.

00:01:06.129 --> 00:01:09.349
And here she just loses control of it.

00:01:09.349 --> 00:01:15.750
When that happens, it may cause a person to act without a sound mind.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.750
Those who continue to lash out an anger will not gain salvation.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:26.950
Ephesians 5.20 lists fits of anger among the works of the flesh that will prevent a person

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.469
from inheriting God's kingdom.

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:33.750
There will be no place for such ones in God's new world.

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.530
A brief review of how uncontrolled anger wrecks peace for ourselves and others will highlight

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.670
why this is so.

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:48.230
Uncontrolled anger harms both the angry person as well as those around him.

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:55.549
We read at Proverbs 29-22 that an angry person stirs up strife, adding that he commits

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:58.390
many transgressions.

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.989
One of these many sins is abusive speech.

00:02:01.989 --> 00:02:08.370
We must work to show restraint when speaking with workmates, with strangers in the ministry,

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:14.270
with our brothers and sisters in the congregation, and with our family members.

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.110
Bad feelings must be controlled.

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.629
A speech ridicule, contempt, and hateful anger are wrong.

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:29.949
Giving vent to such feelings can destroy precious friendships with other people and with

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:31.830
Jehovah.

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.550
Don't be like a volcano.

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.069
That will not quiet down.

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:40.669
Just like an erupting volcano will harm those living around it.

00:02:40.669 --> 00:02:46.949
So too a person who expresses intense anger will harm those living around him.

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:56.389
He also damages himself in what way, acting on anger often leads to even more aggression.

00:02:56.389 --> 00:03:00.629
So then uncontrolled anger can also affect our own peace.

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:04.270
It can cause us to do something that we will later regret.

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:07.789
It can have a negative effect on our health.

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:13.469
Medical studies show that uncontrolled anger can cause high blood pressure and respiratory

00:03:13.469 --> 00:03:14.469
problems.

00:03:14.469 --> 00:03:21.110
It can also affect the liver and pancreas, and such anger can cause digestive problems.

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:26.469
When a person becomes angry, he or she will not always think clearly.

00:03:26.469 --> 00:03:30.990
After a fit of rage, a person may become depressed.

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:39.750
No wonder we read at Proverbs 14 and verse 30 that a calm heart gives life to the body.

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:45.710
The disastrous consequences of uncontrolled anger are illustrated in God's word by

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:51.870
the actions of Simeon and Levi, sons of the patriarch Jacob.

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:57.150
When they learned that their sister Dino was violated by a man named Sheikam, we read

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:03.990
a Genesis 34 and verse 7 that they were offended and very angry.

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:09.110
Now they had a valid reason to be angry, but they took their anger too far.

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:11.310
It was uncontrolled.

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.990
Simeon and Levi took vengeance on Sheikam.

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:21.069
Using deception, they attacked and killed every male in Sheikam city.

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:26.470
Then along with the other sons of Jacob, they plundered it and took the women and little

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:29.110
children captive.

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:36.189
Dino's tragic experience must have grieved Jacob greatly, yet he condemned his son's

00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:38.870
uncontrolled anger.

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:44.350
Simeon and Levi tried to justify their actions, but that was not the end of the matter because

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:47.629
Jehovah was also displeased.

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:53.709
For this reason, Jacob later foretold that the descendants of Simeon and Levi were to

00:04:53.709 --> 00:04:58.189
be scattered among the tribes of Israel.

00:04:58.189 --> 00:05:05.350
Their uncontrolled anger brought disfavor from God and from their father Jacob.

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:11.589
Otherwise, to pay attention to such scriptural accounts and put away uncontrolled anger

00:05:11.589 --> 00:05:14.870
and all of the harm that it brings.

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:21.470
In the following dramatization, notice how a person might be tempted to give in to anger.

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:30.949
Yes, Nana?

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:32.949
Don't forget eggs to you.

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:33.949
No, no, I didn't forget.

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:34.949
Are you sure?

00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:35.949
No, I forget.

00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:36.949
Okay.

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:37.949
Okay, love you.

00:05:37.949 --> 00:05:54.920
Bye.

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:55.920
I've caught ya.

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:56.920
Do you have a minute?

00:05:56.959 --> 00:05:58.120
Hi Emily.

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.120
Can we talk later?

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.120
I'm really struggling this morning.

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:05.920
Do you know, it's just, you've been so busy and I've been waiting for the right moment.

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:08.360
I really just like to address it.

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:12.079
Okay, what's up?

00:06:12.079 --> 00:06:17.000
It's just that I've noticed you were post lately on QuickPost.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.000
What about them?

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.839
Well, do you really think there's something that a pioneer should be posting?

00:06:22.839 --> 00:06:25.600
What are you talking about?

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:28.439
Some people might think you're bragging.

00:06:28.439 --> 00:06:29.439
Some people.

00:06:29.439 --> 00:06:30.439
What people?

00:06:30.439 --> 00:06:31.439
It's a business account.

00:06:31.439 --> 00:06:32.439
I've got to show off my product.

00:06:32.439 --> 00:06:33.439
No, I get that.

00:06:33.439 --> 00:06:36.839
It's just, I don't know, it could feel like you're drawing a little too much attention

00:06:36.839 --> 00:06:37.839
to yourself.

00:06:37.839 --> 00:06:38.839
Who would think like that?

00:06:38.839 --> 00:06:39.839
You.

00:06:39.839 --> 00:06:40.839
No.

00:06:40.839 --> 00:06:41.839
Not just me.

00:06:41.839 --> 00:06:42.839
Celia felt the same.

00:06:42.839 --> 00:06:46.699
You spoke to Celia about this.

00:06:46.699 --> 00:06:47.980
I didn't want to upset you.

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:48.980
Jake said that I needed to take...

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:49.980
Jake!

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:50.980
...set everyone.

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:52.980
Things my posts are in approve.

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:57.300
Not everyone, Haley, that's not what I'm saying at all.

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:59.300
You are such...

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:09.449
I'm just trying to help you if you were just listening to me.

00:07:09.449 --> 00:07:10.449
You're just...

00:07:10.449 --> 00:07:11.449
Celia, listen to me.

00:07:11.449 --> 00:07:14.980
Oh yeah, listen to me.

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:16.980
And I expected more from you.

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:19.620
Haley, what are you talking about?

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:20.620
Gossiping.

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:22.620
About my posts.

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:24.620
You're that lonely.

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:30.339
You've got nothing better to do.

00:07:30.339 --> 00:07:31.339
Haley.

00:07:31.339 --> 00:07:48.319
Were you left feeling a bit tense?

00:07:48.639 --> 00:07:54.079
If so, you know what uncontrolled anger can lead to.

00:07:54.079 --> 00:07:57.680
Now that we've defined uncontrolled anger

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:00.360
and considered what it can lead to,

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:02.360
the next question is,

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:06.680
how can we put away uncontrolled anger?

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:11.319
First, we need to recognize the danger of uncontrolled anger.

00:08:11.319 --> 00:08:14.040
Proverbs 25-28 states

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:17.519
that as a city broken through, without a wall,

00:08:17.519 --> 00:08:21.800
is the man who cannot control his temper.

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:25.480
Strong city walls were vital in ancient times.

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:28.600
Without them, a city would quickly fall to invaders,

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:29.600
likewise.

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:33.080
So will those who cannot control their temper.

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:34.759
By losing control,

00:08:34.759 --> 00:08:39.879
they make themselves vulnerable to the invasion of wrong thoughts,

00:08:39.879 --> 00:08:44.080
thoughts that can cause them to hurt themselves, and others.

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:48.240
Uncontrolled anger can do just that.

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:51.159
Next, after recognizing the danger,

00:08:51.159 --> 00:08:54.720
we must pause and then deal with the anger

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:58.960
before it causes us to do something that we will regret.

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:00.440
When anger grows within us,

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:04.720
we're wise to recall what happened with Simeon and Levi.

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:06.639
We might also recall what happened

00:09:06.639 --> 00:09:10.559
in the video dramatization that we just viewed.

00:09:10.559 --> 00:09:12.720
You see, in each case,

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:15.679
pausing before reacting out of anger

00:09:15.679 --> 00:09:18.000
may have spared much pain and heartache.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.399
True?

00:09:19.399 --> 00:09:24.200
That is why we have this warning at Proverbs 17 and verse 14.

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:29.159
Before the quarrel breaks out, take your leave.

00:09:29.159 --> 00:09:32.159
With that in mind, each of us should ask himself,

00:09:32.159 --> 00:09:34.559
do I tend to jump to conclusions

00:09:34.559 --> 00:09:37.080
when I don't have all the facts?

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:40.879
If so, can I take my leave and put away anger

00:09:40.879 --> 00:09:43.960
before it starts to build up?

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:48.240
The inspired advice found that James chapter 1 and verse 19

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:49.799
will help us to do so.

00:09:49.799 --> 00:09:53.960
But only if we make a sincere and determined effort

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:56.480
to apply what it says.

00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:58.000
Let's read that verse.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.559
James chapter 1 and verse 19.

00:10:01.559 --> 00:10:03.799
And here we find some simple steps

00:10:03.799 --> 00:10:08.000
to help us put away uncontrolled anger.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.840
It says, no this, my beloved brothers.

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:15.200
Everyone must be quick to listen, slow to speak,

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:17.159
slow to anger.

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:22.039
If we ask Jehovah to help us with this,

00:10:22.039 --> 00:10:25.639
namely to be quick to listen, slow to speak,

00:10:25.639 --> 00:10:29.240
slow to anger, he will assist us to do so.

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:32.200
He will help us to see the facts of a matter,

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:38.080
show understanding, and then put away uncontrolled anger.

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:43.000
A word of caution, though, to succeed in doing our part,

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.120
we must choose our associates wisely.

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:49.840
We could undermine all of our good work

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:53.440
and Jehovah's help in controlling our anger

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:56.639
if we choose associates who are arrogant,

00:10:56.639 --> 00:11:01.639
opinionated, or quick to become angry.

00:11:01.679 --> 00:11:04.759
Regarding someone who is disposed to rage,

00:11:04.759 --> 00:11:08.480
Proverbs chapter 22 verse 25 warns,

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:10.759
never learn his ways.

00:11:11.919 --> 00:11:14.960
Well, we've enjoyed another outstanding series of talks

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:19.320
that should help us to keep awake, maintain fine conduct,

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:23.679
and escape the judgment that will soon come in on this world.

00:11:23.679 --> 00:11:26.279
As this symposium has emphasized,

00:11:26.279 --> 00:11:30.360
we must do our utmost to continue to put away peace records

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:35.120
such as inappropriate boasting, envy, dishonesty,

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:39.360
harmful gossip, and uncontrolled anger.

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:42.720
If we have a problem with any of the peacemaking qualities

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:45.279
that we have discussed in this symposium,

00:11:45.279 --> 00:11:50.279
seek Jehovah's hope to change and then work at it.

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:54.240
Our sincere efforts to pursue peace with our brothers

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:57.799
and our sisters will influence how earnestly

00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:02.600
we are awaiting Jehovah's Day and his promised new world.

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:06.240
Yes, our genuine efforts will affect our hearts

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:09.639
and will be noticed by our Heavenly Father.

00:12:09.639 --> 00:12:12.879
Then, in his great mercy,

00:12:12.879 --> 00:12:16.720
Jehovah will consider us to be, as his word says,

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:20.960
spotless and unblemished and in peace,

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:24.600
both with him and with our fellow worshipers.
