00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:09.220
There are many things in life that prepare a person for greater things.

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:14.380
For example, elementary school prepares a student for high school.

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:19.660
Running shorter races prepares a person to run a marathon.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:25.699
Working as an apprentice prepares a worker to serve as a professional.

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:34.420
Well, in this talk, we're going to discuss how that disciple-making now prepares us

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:40.020
for the greater disciple-making work in the New World.

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:46.179
But first, let's briefly discuss how making disciples right now brings a lot of joy.

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:53.539
Please turn to Psalm 105. Now, this is the theme scripture for today's program.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:04.019
Psalm 105 verse 3, boast about His holy name, let the hearts of those seeking Jehovah rejoice.

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:08.819
Notice, we're encouraged to boast about Jehovah's holy name.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:17.700
How do we do this? Well, by preaching, teaching, helping others come to know Jehovah and His purposes.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:25.780
And what is the result of this? Well, honest, hearted ones respond favorably and they began

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:31.459
to seek Jehovah. And how are they affected? Well, as a second part of that verse read,

00:01:32.099 --> 00:01:40.579
their hearts overflow with rejoicing. Now, taking it a little further, how are we affected

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:47.140
when we're able to help someone start seeking Jehovah and to get on that road to everlasting life?

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:54.739
Well, it makes our hearts rejoice in that true. And in fact, there are very few things in life

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:03.140
that can bring more joy than helping someone start seeking Jehovah and get on that narrow road to life.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:10.419
I mean, think about it to explain Bible truth to them. See, their face light up as little light

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:16.659
bubs start going off in their mind as they're learning these truths to see them start making changes

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:22.900
in their life to please Jehovah, to see them become an unbaptized publisher, come up from that

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:29.219
baptismal pool, maybe later get into the pioneer work. There's nothing this world can offer.

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:38.180
No accomplishment, no paycheck that can equal the joy of helping someone start seeking Jehovah.

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:47.699
Aproperately throughout this second day of our program, we have been taught many ways we can

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:55.139
improve in our disciple making skills because it is vital that we do so because eternal lives

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:03.939
hang in the balance. And what is the value of one eternal life? Well, one brother said if all

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:11.219
of Jehovah's witnesses pioneered until the end came and one person learned the truth, it would be

00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:17.219
worth it. That's the value of one life. In fact, with all the money, the gold, the silver, the diamonds

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:27.060
combined, you could not buy one eternal life. It's priceless. But not one, almost 304,000 were helped

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:34.500
to the point of baptism during the last service year as a result of Jehovah blessing the disciple

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:41.939
making skills of his people. But as we mentioned before, learning disciple making skills now

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:52.020
prepares us for the even greater disciple making work of the new world. In fact, let's talk about how

00:03:52.099 --> 00:04:02.419
vast this work will be, this educational work in the new world. If we think about it, millions have been

00:04:02.419 --> 00:04:12.740
made disciples during these last years of the last days. But in the new world, apparently, billions

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:19.939
of disciples will need to be made. How much greater is a billion than a million? One thousand times

00:04:19.939 --> 00:04:28.420
greater. So we're talking about thousands of times more disciples needing to be made than now. And

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:36.740
likely, we will carry on this work of disciple making in the new world for centuries, not just decades

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:43.379
as the case in the last days. And that is really something to think about. In fact, it makes us think

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:53.300
of what Jesus said to his disciples at John 1412. He told them, you will do works greater than I am

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:59.620
doing. So really, we could say that that disciple making work of the new world will be greater.

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:09.459
More people will be witness to and made disciples a larger area, a longer period of time. And

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:17.300
undoubtedly, disciple making in the new world will be even more joyful than disciple making now.

00:05:17.939 --> 00:05:23.300
Now we said before it's indescribable joy to make a disciple now. But why will it be even more

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:30.819
enjoyable? Well, think about the environment. Satan and devil will be gone. That'll be like a

00:05:30.819 --> 00:05:37.300
hundred pound block off all our shoulders. The spirit of the world will no longer exist. That

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:43.459
spirit of the world exhale by Satan, because Satan will be locked in the abyss, and you could say

00:05:43.459 --> 00:05:49.620
it will be airtight. He will not be able to exhale the spirit of the world from there. One

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:57.459
government will rule the entire earth. All human governments will be gone. And think of this, never

00:05:57.459 --> 00:06:05.860
again, never ever will the unrighteous outnumber the righteous. They will always be the minority. So

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:13.860
this wonderful environment will undoubtedly make disciple making even more exhilarating in the

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:23.060
new world. But now let's think for a moment about how voluminous the work itself will be. John 528

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:34.259
and 29 says that all those in the memorial tombs will hear Jesus voice and come out all in the

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:41.379
tombs who will be included among these ones that will come out of the memorial tombs will open

00:06:41.379 --> 00:06:50.980
up to Acts chapter 24. And let's notice who will be included. Acts 24 verse number 15.

00:06:52.500 --> 00:07:01.540
And I have hoped toward God, which hope these men also look forward to, that there is going to be

00:07:01.939 --> 00:07:11.139
a resurrection of both the righteous and the unrighteous. So you notice it's guaranteed it is

00:07:11.139 --> 00:07:17.459
going to happen. Not maybe good possibility. It's going to happen. And it's going to include

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:25.300
the righteous and the unrighteous. But now here's a question. Why will the righteous who are

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:32.259
resurrected need further education? Well, even though they're already servants of God,

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:41.540
they will need to learn details concerning fulfill prophecies, the outworking of God's purposes,

00:07:42.259 --> 00:07:48.100
things that have happened since they died. They'll need to be brought up to speed, so to speak.

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:55.779
And how much they'll need to be taught will depend largely upon how long ago they died.

00:07:56.339 --> 00:08:02.899
They will also need help to continue in their righteous course and to obey the things written

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:11.300
in the scrolls. Revelation 20 verse 12 talks about these new scrolls. It says, I saw the dead,

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:20.100
the great and the small, standing before the throne, and scrolls were opened. The dead were judged

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:27.060
out of those things written in the scrolls according to their deeds. And the watchtower said this about

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:33.539
those new scrolls. It said, these scrolls will most likely set forth Jehovah's requirements

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:41.139
for mankind at that time. By studying these, all people, including resurrected ones,

00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:49.220
will be able to know God's will for them. These scrolls will surely give us further insight

00:08:50.019 --> 00:08:58.340
into Jehovah's mind. That's exciting indeed to ponder, isn't it? Included among the righteous,

00:08:58.419 --> 00:09:06.259
through resurrected, will be fateful ones who will be brought back to serve as princes.

00:09:07.299 --> 00:09:16.820
Psalm 45-16 says that Jesus will appoint princes in all the earth. And the watchtower pointed out

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:23.700
that one example would be Daniel. Do you remember what Jehovah promised him shortly before he died? He

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:33.220
said, you will rest, but you will stand up for your lot at the end of the days. Well, he's rested

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:40.419
in the grave for some 2,500 years, but he'll stand up in the resurrection, and he'll take his position

00:09:40.419 --> 00:09:47.299
as one of these princes as pointed out in the watchtower. Now, of course, Daniel and others like him

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:53.139
will need to be brought up to speed, updated, trained for their assignments.

00:09:53.860 --> 00:10:02.019
Also, many of the princes will be selected from the fateful elders who are taking the lead today

00:10:02.019 --> 00:10:08.340
as pointed out by the watchtower, but of course, Jesus, the Messianic King, will make the appointments.

00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:15.779
So what do we know? They will be good appointments. They will be princes who will truly love the people

00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:22.179
and faithfully carry out all the directions of the heavenly government.

00:10:23.379 --> 00:10:28.740
Also included among the righteous to be resurrected will be many of our loved ones

00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:35.940
who may have thought they would live to see the end of this system, but they died in the last days.

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:41.539
But now what a joy it will be for you brothers and sisters to welcome these ones back

00:10:42.419 --> 00:10:49.299
and teach them about all the things that have happened since they died. They'll need to be brought

00:10:49.299 --> 00:10:56.100
up to date, so they can help in this great disciple-making work, an example I think of my mother.

00:10:57.139 --> 00:11:06.980
She was baptized in 1938. She died in 2012, a little over 8 years ago. She really wanted to see

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:13.460
the end of this system, and she was of that judge, brother for generation, really wanted to see

00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:20.100
that prostitute destroyed, but cancer prevented that from happening. And I remember shortly before

00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:27.299
she died, I said, Mom, I know you wanted to go into the New World, the overland passage away,

00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:34.500
never died all, but you're going to have to take the underground tunnel. But the main thing is to

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:39.139
get there, and you're going to very shortly close your eyes, and the next thing you're going to see,

00:11:39.139 --> 00:11:46.019
you're going to open your eyes in that New World. But when she comes back, just think of the things

00:11:46.019 --> 00:11:51.059
that have happened in the eight years she's been gone. She'll have to be brought up to speed,

00:11:51.059 --> 00:12:01.940
won't you? This is JW Broadcasting from the World Headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses. She didn't

00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:07.620
even know about the broadcast. She'll have to be brought up to speed, but she'll be so happy

00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:15.700
to learn about this and other developments. But here's a question, where will the billions of

00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:23.620
new disciples come from? Even though the resurrected righteous ones will need to be educated,

00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:30.100
they're already disciples, aren't they? So where will the new disciples come from? Well,

00:12:30.179 --> 00:12:38.580
ones born after Armageddon will need to be made disciples. Also, there'll be a vast multitude

00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:46.500
of unrighteous ones who will return from the grave. Now, they'll come from all different backgrounds,

00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:54.899
and they'll come back and they'll need to be taught. They'll need help to accept Christ's ransom,

00:12:55.779 --> 00:13:01.299
to obey the things that are written in the New Scrolls, because most of them will know nothing.

00:13:01.299 --> 00:13:08.259
Now, maybe some studied a while, but death prevented them from continuing, but most will know nothing

00:13:08.259 --> 00:13:14.580
completely unaware about the good news. And as we said, they'll come from all time periods,

00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:22.899
locations, cultures, some may have been rulers, maybe slaves, maybe criminals, maybe self-righteous

00:13:22.899 --> 00:13:30.500
persons, maybe ones died in combat, died in childbirth, died of disease, perhaps the

00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:39.539
coronavirus, died by starvation, natural disaster, and it seems that the last thought on their

00:13:39.539 --> 00:13:45.539
mind when they died will be the first thought when they come back. I was thinking about the men who

00:13:45.539 --> 00:13:51.860
threw the three Hebrews into the fiery furnace, and they died because of the heat. They'll come back

00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:59.460
with a vivid memory of that situation, and yet they'll have to be taught what happened

00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:08.899
after they died, how those three Hebrews came out unharmed, see. Just imagine all these backgrounds

00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:17.139
of ones coming back. Imagine situations it could develop. Here's just an example. Imagine a former

00:14:17.139 --> 00:14:25.139
ruler had hundreds, maybe thousands of slaves, who cater to his every desire. Now, he comes back

00:14:25.139 --> 00:14:32.820
in a resurrection, and his overseer is one of his former slaves. And he tells him, gives him direction,

00:14:33.539 --> 00:14:40.419
loving direction, but direction, to plant a tree in a certain location. Now, will he humble himself?

00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:46.340
Interesting, interesting possibilities. Think of the atheists who will be resurrected.

00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:53.220
Here they ate Jehovah's food, they drank his water, they breathed his air, they walked on his ground,

00:14:54.259 --> 00:15:00.580
never gave him any credit, never acknowledged him at all. Makes us think of the illustration of

00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:07.860
the pig under the apple tree. He gobbles up the apples off the ground, but he never looks up to see

00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:14.259
where they came from. Now, we may not use that illustration with these atheists that come back,

00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:20.740
but they will have to be helped to see what a selfish life they lived. And now they're going to

00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:29.059
have to praise Jehovah, acknowledge, give him honor, glory, and worship. Will they do so? Well,

00:15:29.059 --> 00:15:37.779
it'll be up to them, but you brothers and sisters will help such ones. In fact, let's just ponder

00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:44.100
some of these ones will come back by means of some artwork. Now, look at the following artwork,

00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:50.340
please. And it's going to show you people from different time periods, different backgrounds

00:15:51.139 --> 00:15:58.740
being taught after they're resurrected. And as the artwork displays, try to imagine yourself

00:15:59.379 --> 00:17:44.460
teaching ones of these various backgrounds. And brothers and sisters, that artwork

00:17:45.099 --> 00:17:51.579
is just a little tiny sampling of ones from various time periods and backgrounds

00:17:51.579 --> 00:17:59.339
who will return to the land of the living. But as we mentioned, Jehovah will empower Jesus

00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:07.819
to resurrect all of these ones, bringing them back from the memorial tombs. They will hear his

00:18:07.819 --> 00:18:15.099
voice and they will come out. And we know it'll be a controlled orderly way. See, Jehovah is a

00:18:15.099 --> 00:18:23.500
God not of disorder, but a peace. 1 Corinthians 14, 33. He also wants things to take place

00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:30.859
decently and by arrangement. 1 Corinthians 14, 40. So if they all came back at once,

00:18:31.819 --> 00:18:38.220
that would be a chaotic population explosion, wouldn't it? They couldn't even be taught properly.

00:18:39.019 --> 00:18:45.339
They couldn't be cared for. We know it will be progressive during the thousand years. And

00:18:45.339 --> 00:18:51.259
Oarshar said this, faithful Christians who died shortly before the end of Satan's system

00:18:52.059 --> 00:18:59.339
will likely be among the first ones raised. We can also expect an early resurrection

00:19:00.299 --> 00:19:07.420
for the fateful men of old who will serve as princes. We touched on that previously.

00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:16.779
Yes, resurrected ones will have much to learn. And you dear brothers and sisters will have the

00:19:16.779 --> 00:19:22.859
privilege to help them see. They'll need to learn about Jehovah, his qualities. All the wonderful

00:19:22.859 --> 00:19:31.099
things he's done. Many will need to reject false religious ideas that they believed in Satan's

00:19:31.099 --> 00:19:39.099
world. Here's just an example. Imagine one who really believed that all good people go to heaven.

00:19:40.299 --> 00:19:45.180
But now he's resurrected and he's brought back here to the earth. Obviously he'll know that

00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:51.500
teaching was wrong. But what about other false teachings that he believed? Will he change his

00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:58.539
mind and heart? Will he accept these truths? It'll be up to him. But you, brothers and sisters,

00:19:58.539 --> 00:20:05.019
will help such ones. There will be many others who will come back who will have to abandon their

00:20:05.019 --> 00:20:12.859
former way of life. I was thinking as an example, a homosexual. Now this former homosexual comes

00:20:12.859 --> 00:20:19.819
back into resurrection and he really thought and he was taught and he came to believe that God

00:20:19.819 --> 00:20:27.500
accepted him with that lifestyle. But now he's going to learn about Jehovah's moral standards

00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:31.900
and he's going to learn that Jehovah will not lower his standard to accommodate us.

00:20:33.099 --> 00:20:39.900
We have to come up to Jehovah's standard. Will he change? Will he adjust? It'll be up to him.

00:20:40.539 --> 00:20:45.660
But you, brothers and sisters, will help such ones to enjoy life eternal.

00:20:46.619 --> 00:20:54.140
All must learn to walk into Jehovah's righteous ways and willingly choose to do so.

00:20:55.099 --> 00:21:01.420
But now what if someone refuses to make the necessary changes? Well, the Watchtower commented on that.

00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:10.779
It said, after being given ample time, maybe even a hundred years to seek God, some will show that

00:21:10.779 --> 00:21:17.420
they refuse to practice righteousness. Justly, they will lose life in the New World.

00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:25.900
As we can see from Isaiah 65, verse 12, which says, and the center will be cursed,

00:21:26.859 --> 00:21:33.819
even though he is a hundred years of age. But we expect this will be the minority,

00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:40.539
that the majority will be delighted to make the adjustments so they can live in that wonderful

00:21:40.539 --> 00:21:46.220
New World. But I think about what one brother told me concerning his Bible student,

00:21:46.859 --> 00:21:52.779
his Bible student kept saying, well, you know, how do I know I'm going to like life in the New World?

00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:58.619
How do I know I'm not going to be bored? Well, finally, the brother told him, he said, well,

00:21:58.619 --> 00:22:04.380
one thing about it, if you don't like being there, you don't have to stay.

00:22:05.259 --> 00:22:10.779
Now, it's kind of humorous, but a lot of truth. A person has to willingly want to be there,

00:22:10.779 --> 00:22:19.099
make the necessary changes, but we believe the vast majority will be delighted to do so.

00:22:19.819 --> 00:22:28.380
And what a privilege it will be to teach ones in that New World a time when Isaiah 119 will be true,

00:22:29.099 --> 00:22:33.019
which says, the earth will certainly be filled with a knowledge of Jehovah

00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:42.940
as though waters are covering the sea. I mean, think about it, this earth, 71% of its surface

00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:46.940
is covered with water. And if you smooth all the land out,

00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:55.420
sea water would cover the planet earth one and two-thirds miles deep. This is a watery planet,

00:22:55.420 --> 00:23:02.220
isn't? Well, that illustration there in Isaiah just shows how prolific, how widespread,

00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:08.779
how filled the earth will be with a knowledge of Jehovah at that time. And that wonderful knowledge

00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:16.299
will enable faithful humans to grow to perfection and to sufficiently be equipped,

00:23:17.099 --> 00:23:26.380
to face and pass the final test at the end of the thousand years. And the good things that

00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:30.140
you, dear brothers and sisters, have learned today, this second day of our program,

00:23:30.859 --> 00:23:37.019
what you've learned today about helping your Bible students now will help you in the New World.

00:23:37.019 --> 00:23:42.539
As you learn, you learned how to teach your Bible students to feed themselves spiritually,

00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:50.460
to attend the meetings, to avoid bad associations, to overcome unclean habits,

00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:57.660
to develop a personal relationship with Jehovah. See, those very same things you will need to

00:23:57.660 --> 00:24:04.859
teach these new ones that come back in the resurrection. So at this time, let's review

00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:10.220
some of the good things that we have learned today about disciple making.

00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:17.660
And let's meditate on how these skills will help in the New World. In fact, look at this video,

00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:26.619
please, a brief video that gives us some highlights from our first symposium which was entitled

00:24:26.619 --> 00:24:38.339
improve your skills. Since there's no death or pain in heaven, where would this promise to play?

00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:42.180
The earth. Would you like to learn how to be part of that future?

00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:47.619
If these are God's promises, wouldn't it make sense to go to His Word to find out how to enjoy them?

00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:52.660
Maybe we can think of it this way. When parents with a severe genetic defect have children,

00:24:53.220 --> 00:25:01.779
what happens? I get it. No study is perfect. She's making some effort. Focus on that. If anyone's

00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:11.140
confused as a miscontagious, it's yours. I can help if you want. The real question is, do you trust

00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:27.319
Him? I want to. I really do. As we saw in that video, we want to improve our skills. And in

00:25:27.319 --> 00:25:33.880
the symposium, we saw six areas in which we can improve our skills. And each one of the six

00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:39.960
videos in that symposium discuss one of those skills. In review, Nita in the first video,

00:25:40.599 --> 00:25:49.880
the Bible study conductor, use questions to help the interested person see the practical value

00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:58.039
of the Bible. In the second video, next time they met, Nita unleashed the power of God's Word

00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:07.559
by showing her student scriptures that highlight our spiritual need. In the third video, Nita

00:26:07.559 --> 00:26:16.920
illustrated a damaged sin by likening it to inherited illness. In the fourth video,

00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:24.039
when our Bible students seem to be losing interest, Nita learned the importance of enthusiasm

00:26:24.039 --> 00:26:32.440
to motivate. In the fifth video, Nita showed empathy for her student's stressful circumstances

00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:39.880
and provided practical help. And then in the last, the sixth video, Nita's conviction

00:26:40.759 --> 00:26:49.079
and scriptural reasoning helped to reach her student's heart so that she reconsidered her

00:26:49.079 --> 00:26:57.400
situation and her views on morals. Can you just imagine how those six skills you'll use in the

00:26:57.400 --> 00:27:03.799
New World? Think about it. You'll use questions, won't you? You'll use questions to help resurrected

00:27:03.799 --> 00:27:09.640
ones see the practical value of the Bible and the new scrolls. And by the way, the Bible will be

00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:17.880
used in the New World. You will unleash the power of God's Word and the power of the scrolls

00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:24.279
by showing these new ones scriptures. You will use good illustrations to help them reason.

00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:34.920
You will use enthusiasm to motivate. You will show empathy, especially for ones who have scars

00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:43.640
as a result of a horrible life in Satan's old world. You will also use conviction and scriptural

00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:51.720
reasoning to reach their heart. But now let's move to our second symposium. And it was

00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:58.279
entitled, Accept Jehovah's Help. And we discussed three aids Jehovah gives us. Let's look at this

00:27:58.279 --> 00:28:07.799
brief video that will remind us of that second symposium. Her real issue was getting to know someone

00:28:07.799 --> 00:28:13.960
she can't see. Maybe that's the best place to begin. I did some research and I think you're really

00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:22.089
like what I found. Come on, come sit down. I've tried everything to get J2 a meeting. Have you tried

00:28:22.089 --> 00:28:30.009
bring other people on the study? You were in a band. I love that song. I actually have that vinyl.

00:28:30.730 --> 00:28:38.650
Look, I know you're busy. No clue, do you? I've got to go. So I asked him to help J2,

00:28:39.529 --> 00:28:51.190
and left it with him. Well, as reminded in that video, Jehovah provides research tools.

00:28:51.990 --> 00:29:00.069
He provides the brotherhood. And he provides help by means of prayer. And you'll use those things

00:29:00.069 --> 00:29:07.269
in the new world, obviously. See, just like Anita, she used research tools to prepare to discuss

00:29:07.269 --> 00:29:13.750
evolution with her student. When she realized she had limited understanding of the student's background,

00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:21.109
she sought help from the brotherhood. She brought along a publisher who had a similar background

00:29:21.109 --> 00:29:28.630
to her student. And that third video, when her student resisted, Anita's encouragement to prepare

00:29:28.630 --> 00:29:36.630
for her Bible study, Anita prayed to Jehovah to help her and to motivate the student.

00:29:37.269 --> 00:29:44.470
And we know Jehovah hears prayers, but imagine you'll use research tools, you use the brotherhood,

00:29:44.470 --> 00:29:51.269
you'll use prayer to make disciples in the new world. But now let's go to that third symposium,

00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:58.470
help your Bible students to, and we talked about five things we wanted to help them to do.

00:29:59.029 --> 00:30:04.549
Let's look at this video, which will remind us of that third symposium.

00:30:05.349 --> 00:30:11.990
Which do you remember more from our studies? The answers? Or the things that touch your heart?

00:30:14.309 --> 00:30:20.309
It's asking how Jehovah feels about something, and then what that means for me.

00:30:20.309 --> 00:30:23.349
My meeting part tonight covers that point. Why don't you come?

00:30:24.789 --> 00:30:32.549
I'm having some people over this weekend. It wasn't the club, but it was still fun, eating it

00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:40.150
though impossible. Be made new in your dominant mental attitude. I remembered one of the Psalms,

00:30:40.150 --> 00:30:44.549
I will walk in your truth and you'll find my heart to fear your name.

00:30:49.019 --> 00:30:54.539
Well as reminded, there are five things we want to help our students to accomplish.

00:30:55.339 --> 00:31:02.220
That first video in this symposium, Anita helped her student learn to feed herself spiritually.

00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:07.740
By demonstrating how she herself prepared for their study.

00:31:08.539 --> 00:31:14.700
The second video, Anita returned to the subject of meeting attendance by pointing out that the next

00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:21.819
meeting would consider a question she had raised previously. The third video,

00:31:22.859 --> 00:31:29.980
Anita helped her student to seek good association by arranging for her to attend a Christian gathering.

00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:37.579
Then the fourth video, when it became clear that the student was not ready to be a publisher because

00:31:37.579 --> 00:31:47.180
of an unclean practice, Anita gently helped her to appreciate what it means to become and remain

00:31:47.180 --> 00:31:54.220
clean in Jehovah's eyes. And then the last video that fifth one most important,

00:31:54.940 --> 00:32:01.579
Anita helped her student to develop strong love for Jehovah that would be so strong

00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:05.500
she would be able to resist pressure from the world.

00:32:06.779 --> 00:32:13.339
Well, you can imagine you'll use the very same skills. You'll try to help your students there

00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:18.700
to accomplish the same five things we discussed. You'll help them to learn to feed themselves

00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:24.779
spiritually. You'll help them to attend meetings. You'll help them to see the need to seek out

00:32:24.779 --> 00:32:35.339
good association to avoid unclean practices and most importantly to develop deep love for Jehovah.

00:32:36.299 --> 00:32:46.059
Yes, it's obvious that our skills, our experience, our qualities learn now in the disciple making

00:32:46.059 --> 00:32:53.339
work will be very valuable in the new world. You'll be able to put these skills to good use,

00:32:53.339 --> 00:33:01.259
then, say. So let's all strive to improve as teachers. And that's what Titus 1.9 says,

00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:10.700
that we should hold firmly to the faithful word as respects our art of teaching. And we want to be

00:33:10.779 --> 00:33:16.859
artists, the art of teaching. You may have heard the difference between a laborer, a craftsman,

00:33:16.859 --> 00:33:25.900
and an artist. A laborer uses his back. A craftsman has to add his mind, but an artist adds his heart.

00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:32.940
We don't want to be just laborers, craftsmen, but artists really putting our heart into the disciple

00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:39.099
making work. And it does take effort. Let's look at one last scripture here, 1 Timothy chapter 4.

00:33:39.819 --> 00:33:48.460
The effort involved, but it's worth the effort. 1 Timothy 4 verse 15, ponder over these things.

00:33:49.339 --> 00:33:56.299
Be absorbed in them so that your advancement may be plainly seen by all people.

00:33:57.099 --> 00:34:05.339
Pay constant attention to yourself and your teaching. Persevere in these things. For by doing this,

00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:13.820
you will save both yourself and those who listen to you. That's true now. It will be true in the

00:34:13.820 --> 00:34:21.179
new world. And Jehovah is providing what we need. He's giving us excellent training. He provides

00:34:21.179 --> 00:34:27.420
excellent tools. We want to make good use of both of these provisions, but we do want to give

00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:34.300
this caution. Don't be overwhelmed, please. We've discussed a lot of skills, a lot of suggestions,

00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:40.780
but don't be overwhelmed. Jehovah's going to help you. He will bless your efforts to do your best.

00:34:40.780 --> 00:34:47.019
And we encourage you to just pick out one or two skills at first and work on those. And then you

00:34:47.019 --> 00:34:55.820
can move on to other things. In conclusion, think about this, there are many secular skills practiced

00:34:55.820 --> 00:35:05.739
today that will not even exist in the new world. Doctors, no doctors, nurses, optometrist,

00:35:05.739 --> 00:35:15.019
undertakers, locksmiths, lawyers. Such professions will not even exist. But your skills,

00:35:15.659 --> 00:35:23.980
as a disciple maker, will be in high demand. You will be able to use these skills to the full.

00:35:24.699 --> 00:35:36.460
And you will definitely rejoice greatly as you share in this voluminous, this enormous new world

00:35:36.460 --> 00:35:48.940
educational campaign soon to come.
