WEBVTT

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:08.439
Well, perhaps we could take out Bibles and turn to Colossians chapter 3 and verse 13.

00:00:08.439 --> 00:00:14.839
And let's analyze this verse together and see what is it that Jehovah expects of us.

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:21.039
So in Colossians 3-13, it says continue putting up with one another

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:27.239
and forgiving one another freely, even if anyone has a cause for complaint against another.

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:33.240
Just as Jehovah freely forgave you, you must also do the same.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:37.340
Or certainly this verse gives us plenty of food for thought, doesn't it?

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.840
Are areas in which perhaps we can work on and improve in?

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.340
But what two things stand out as being required of us?

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.740
Well, looking back, you notice the first one, continue putting up with one another

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.340
and then the second point, forgiving one another freely.

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:02.240
Well, let's look at that first expression, continue putting up with one another.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.840
What's the difference between these two expressions?

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.739
Well, we're told that this first expression doesn't refer to serious sins,

00:01:10.739 --> 00:01:16.239
but perhaps talks about things that are irritating, annoying,

00:01:16.239 --> 00:01:20.840
things that we may not necessarily have a cause for complaint concerning,

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.239
but they still get us very upset anyway.

00:01:24.239 --> 00:01:27.040
These minor things.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:32.040
What are some of the things that annoy you? Let's be honest.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.840
Are you annoyed when someone is always late?

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.390
Are you annoyed when they're always early?

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.090
Are you annoyed when someone is outspoken?

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.989
Does it annoy you when someone's too quiet?

00:01:48.989 --> 00:01:52.590
It's amazing, isn't it? What are the things that annoy us?

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.090
I remember back in the 70s, Brother Norgever, an outstanding talk

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.689
where he alluded to the fact that maybe there's a sister in the congregation

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:04.489
and she's hearing this other sister, new in the truth,

00:02:04.489 --> 00:02:08.189
answering up time after time, and then her heart she's thinking,

00:02:08.189 --> 00:02:11.990
why doesn't she just keep quiet?

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.689
Well, maybe we've all experienced those feelings.

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:18.590
And if we're judged on them, perhaps we'll agree.

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.490
Well, it's not justified. I don't really have a cause,

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:24.689
but it still irritates me.

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:27.689
It's true, isn't it? The expression sometimes,

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:30.789
it's not the mountains ahead of us that cause problems.

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:32.990
It's the pebble in the shoe.

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:37.990
And it's sometimes the small things that irritate us the most.

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:41.789
I remember when I was serving in Western Samoa many years ago

00:02:41.889 --> 00:02:44.490
at the branch, we had quite a number of brothers

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.189
from overseas working on construction.

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:49.090
And there was one brother who had the habit,

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.889
first in the morning, as he arrived before breakfast,

00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:58.590
saying, good morning to everyone.

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.889
Some found that annoying.

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:04.289
Maybe you can relate to that.

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:07.090
And no doubt you feel very happy when you read the scripture

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.090
in Proverbs 27, 14, where it says in one translation,

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.389
a loud and cheerful greeting early in the morning

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:17.590
is taken as a curse.

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.689
You may be thinking, amen to that.

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:23.990
And that brother ceased his habit after he read that scripture,

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:27.889
or at least it was read to him.

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:30.889
But we may not always be able to find a scripture

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:34.990
that backs up this irritation that we feel.

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:37.590
So what do we do? Well, what does it say?

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.990
Continue putting up with one another.

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:45.389
Continue. It's something that we just have to keep on doing.

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:48.590
That brings us to the second part of our verse,

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.090
forgiving one another freely.

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.889
It's interesting when we look at other translations

00:03:54.889 --> 00:03:59.090
of this verse, most follow the King James version

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.789
and just say, forgive.

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:06.090
The New York translation says, forgive freely.

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.490
The reason is that this isn't your normal Greek word

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:11.490
for forgiveness.

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:15.189
It denotes generosity, a willingness

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:18.189
to go beyond what's required.

00:04:18.189 --> 00:04:19.689
It's interesting that the Watchtow,

00:04:19.689 --> 00:04:24.689
even back in 1882, was using that expression

00:04:24.689 --> 00:04:26.589
to forgive one another freely,

00:04:26.589 --> 00:04:30.389
well before the time of the New World translation.

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:32.389
So this gives us something to think about

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:35.490
because it's not just a matter of forgiving,

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:38.889
but we need to be generous about forgiving.

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:41.790
We have to be willing to, as it were,

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:47.790
bestow a pardon on someone who really doesn't deserve that pardon.

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:50.790
Now, why should we be interested in developing

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.290
and working on these two aspects,

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:57.389
putting up with one another and forgiving freely?

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:01.189
Well, we've heard the reasons many times before, haven't we?

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:04.589
The first one, of course, is that your hover has forgiven us.

00:05:04.589 --> 00:05:07.189
And if we turn back just one chapter,

00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:09.790
chapter two of Colossians,

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:14.089
and verse 13, this point is highlighted for us.

00:05:14.089 --> 00:05:16.889
It says in chapter two, verse 13,

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:19.889
furthermore though, you were dead in your trespasses

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:22.790
and in the uncircumcised state of your flesh,

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:25.490
God made you alive together with him.

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:29.389
He kindly forgave you all,

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:32.990
or forgave us all our trespasses.

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:36.290
So this is the model that your hover has given us.

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:40.389
It's true, we sometimes can find some reason

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:43.689
why we feel we don't have to forgive someone else.

00:05:43.689 --> 00:05:46.490
But remember the illustration Jesus gave

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:49.290
of the slave who had the huge dead.

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:51.889
If you calculated in Daenerys,

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:55.990
there were 60 million Daenerys that he owed.

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:57.490
He was forgiven that.

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:59.790
Then he went after the other man

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:01.990
with who owed him just a small amount.

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:04.490
But have you ever thought, if you asked that slave,

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:06.389
maybe he would say, well, it's true.

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:09.790
I really appreciate having everything forgiven,

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:10.990
but I still don't have any money.

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:11.790
I need some money.

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:15.189
So that's why I wanted to get the other slave

00:06:15.189 --> 00:06:16.790
to give me the money.

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:18.589
Well, there's always a reason, isn't it?

00:06:18.589 --> 00:06:20.689
Even if it's a distorted reason,

00:06:20.689 --> 00:06:24.189
as to why we don't follow Jehovah's example.

00:06:24.189 --> 00:06:26.990
But looking back at Colossians three, verse 13,

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:28.589
what does it say?

00:06:28.589 --> 00:06:31.790
If anyone has a cause for complaint,

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:33.389
against another.

00:06:33.389 --> 00:06:36.490
So that gives us a good idea, doesn't it?

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:39.089
The second reason, of course, is that

00:06:39.089 --> 00:06:42.990
we do need others to forgive us.

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:48.490
The very things that annoy us and irritate us in others

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:51.689
are sometimes the same things that we do to others.

00:06:51.689 --> 00:06:53.290
Have you ever noticed that?

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:56.589
And how annoying it is when someone points that out to you?

00:06:56.589 --> 00:06:58.089
You're annoyed with that person?

00:06:58.089 --> 00:07:00.889
Don't you realize what you do?

00:07:00.889 --> 00:07:03.089
Well, that's something good for us to remember,

00:07:03.089 --> 00:07:04.089
isn't it?

00:07:04.089 --> 00:07:06.990
The fact that we do need to have others forgive us.

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:10.889
And then another reason is that it maintains the peace

00:07:10.889 --> 00:07:13.490
within the Christian congregation.

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:15.189
The watchtower made the comment on this.

00:07:15.189 --> 00:07:18.889
It said that in countries where our work is restricted

00:07:18.889 --> 00:07:21.490
or under ban, many of our brothers

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:24.689
have to meet together in smaller groups.

00:07:24.689 --> 00:07:26.889
And when you do that, you get to know

00:07:26.889 --> 00:07:30.290
everyone's weaknesses, idiosyncrasies.

00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:33.189
It's so much easier to be annoyed by others

00:07:33.189 --> 00:07:36.589
when you're dealing with small groups of persons.

00:07:36.589 --> 00:07:38.889
The watchtower then made the comment,

00:07:38.889 --> 00:07:40.990
what good training it is for us now

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:43.589
to learn how to put up with one another

00:07:43.589 --> 00:07:46.389
when we're in larger groups, because later,

00:07:46.389 --> 00:07:49.889
we may need to worship Jehovah in smaller groups.

00:07:49.889 --> 00:07:53.089
So it's good training for us as we keep peace

00:07:53.089 --> 00:07:54.990
in the congregation.

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:55.990
And what can help us?

00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:57.689
Well, there are many different things

00:07:57.689 --> 00:07:59.889
that can help us in this regard.

00:07:59.889 --> 00:08:01.790
The one point in the marginal reference,

00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:05.490
you see there is first Peter chapter four in verse eight.

00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:07.589
And that's where it tells us we need to have

00:08:07.589 --> 00:08:11.089
intense love for one another.

00:08:11.089 --> 00:08:13.589
Not just love, but intense love.

00:08:13.589 --> 00:08:16.790
And this word intense means full strength.

00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:19.589
Literally, it means to stretch out our love.

00:08:20.589 --> 00:08:23.089
So as we come across these things

00:08:23.089 --> 00:08:25.889
that irritate us and annoy us in life,

00:08:25.889 --> 00:08:27.790
or if we come across persons

00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:30.189
who actually do sin against us,

00:08:30.189 --> 00:08:32.190
what should we keep in mind?

00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:35.190
Continue putting up with one another.

00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:38.190
Continue freely forgiving one another.
