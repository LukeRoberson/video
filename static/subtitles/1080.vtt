WEBVTT

00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:09.810
Our convention program contains over 90 audio and video productions, including the one we just enjoyed.

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:13.810
Now, these videos are made at various locations around the world.

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:20.809
In the days of Ezra and Nehemiah, the Israelites willingly gave material contributions in support of true worship,

00:00:20.809 --> 00:00:23.809
and we have the same privilege today.

00:00:23.809 --> 00:00:30.809
For your convenience, donations can be made online at donate.jw.org.

00:00:31.809 --> 00:00:41.700
Please be seated. This convention has clearly shown that Jehovah wants us to rejoice.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.700
What is our greatest source of joy, both now and in the future?

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:52.700
We know that you will appreciate the heartwarming final talk of this convention.

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:59.700
Brother David's plane of the governing body will discuss the theme, find exquisite delight in Jehovah.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:12.640
He was an old man, a very successful one.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:19.640
He had made a lot of money in his time, but let's not envy him.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.640
Because for much of his life, he was under a lot of pressure.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.640
His first marriage was a troubled one. His wife was cold and critical.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:37.640
He'd raised a large family in the truth, but some of his sons didn't turn out so well.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:43.640
A few of his friends weren't there for him when he needed the most.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.640
He lost a child in death.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:56.340
You may have guessed that we're talking about David, the writer of the 37th Psalm.

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:03.340
I was once young, he said, but now I am old.

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:10.340
So here is an old man taking stock of his life and sharing a secret with us.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:16.340
What was it that helped him to cope when everything around him was going wrong?

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:21.340
Let's find out. Let's turn to Psalm 37 and verse 4.

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.340
This is the theme text for our discussion, so I'll give you a moment to find that.

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.960
Psalm 37 and verse 4.

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:42.960
In David writes, find exquisite delight in Jehovah and he will grant you the desires of your heart.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.960
We're going to focus on the first part of the verse at this point.

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:51.960
Find exquisite delight in Jehovah.

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.960
Or maybe you say exquisite?

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:00.960
Whether you say exquisite or exquisite, we don't use that expression very much, do we?

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.960
But look down at the footnote.

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:06.960
It says, find your greatest joy.

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:16.960
So David is saying, find your greatest joy in Jehovah and he will give you the desire of your heart.

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:20.960
And that was David's secret.

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.960
He couldn't always count on his family life.

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:27.960
And he never knew when a trusted friend would turn against him.

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.960
But he did know his God.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:35.960
He knew that Jehovah would never disappoint him.

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:38.960
Well, that's a good reminder for us, isn't it?

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.960
Humans may disappoint.

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.960
Jehovah never.

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:47.960
He is our north star.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:53.960
And so when we get lost or when we get confused, when we feel we've lost our way, we really need to look heavenward.

00:03:53.960 --> 00:04:01.460
Look to Jehovah and let Jehovah be our greatest joy.

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:04.460
To know Jehovah is to love him.

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:11.460
Now, what do you do when you want to get close to someone when you want to develop a friendship with someone?

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:14.460
Well, you find ways to spend time with that person.

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:17.459
You want that person as a friend.

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:22.459
And so you go about finding ways to spend time with that person.

00:04:22.459 --> 00:04:24.459
Well, it's the same with Jehovah God.

00:04:24.459 --> 00:04:27.459
We want him as our friend.

00:04:27.459 --> 00:04:29.459
So what do we do?

00:04:29.459 --> 00:04:38.459
We look for ways to spend time with him, reading his word, meditating on his word, letting it sink deeply into our heart.

00:04:38.459 --> 00:04:46.459
And then the more we get to know Jehovah, the more we love him, and the more it is we'll be in his presence.

00:04:46.459 --> 00:04:48.459
And that's where prayer comes in.

00:04:48.459 --> 00:05:01.459
We can develop a friendship with Jehovah that is so close, so intimate, that we can confide in Jehovah things that we would never ever tell another human on earth.

00:05:01.459 --> 00:05:03.459
And the good news?

00:05:03.459 --> 00:05:10.839
The good news is that Jehovah wants us to get just that close to him.

00:05:10.839 --> 00:05:14.839
Well, we had big plans for this summer, didn't we?

00:05:14.839 --> 00:05:26.839
Special conventions, regional conventions in all parts of the earth, happy times, warm fellowship, and then the coronavirus.

00:05:26.839 --> 00:05:34.839
Near the end of March, the governing body realized that we were going to have to make some important adjustments as far as the conventions were concerned.

00:05:34.839 --> 00:05:36.839
But what to do?

00:05:36.839 --> 00:05:38.839
All of the outlines had been prepared.

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:40.839
48 of them.

00:05:40.839 --> 00:05:43.839
Well, the teaching committee came up with an idea.

00:05:43.839 --> 00:05:59.839
Let's have the governing body, and many of the helpers deliver all of the convention talks on the program, will record them, and then the brothers on, in all parts of the earth, will be able to enjoy the program in safety.

00:05:59.839 --> 00:06:04.839
Well, this was going to be a tremendous job for a number of Bethel departments.

00:06:04.839 --> 00:06:14.839
60 members of the broadcasting department here at headquarters worked tirelessly over a three-week period to schedule and record the program.

00:06:14.839 --> 00:06:27.839
And in the branches, thousands of energetic volunteers in our translation departments produced the program in 400 languages, probably more than 400 languages, when it's all done.

00:06:27.839 --> 00:06:34.839
And then 44 broadcasting departments in the branches also had to share.

00:06:34.839 --> 00:06:46.839
So to all of those who had to share in making this program possible, all those who were involved in scheduling and recording and translating, we want to say thank you.

00:06:46.839 --> 00:06:50.839
Thank you so very much for all you've done for us.

00:06:50.839 --> 00:06:58.339
Now, speaking of broadcasting, do you think Jehovah has been preparing us for something like this pandemic?

00:06:58.339 --> 00:07:09.339
Think about this. A few years ago, the decision was made to set up something called JW Broadcasting.

00:07:09.339 --> 00:07:20.339
And at the time, who knew how practical an arrangement that was going to turn out to be? And who knows what uses JWB will be put to in the future?

00:07:20.339 --> 00:07:34.339
Jehovah knows. Jehovah looks ahead. Sometimes we don't know ourselves why certain decisions are made or why we are making certain decisions. But Jehovah knows. Jehovah is our greatest joy.

00:07:34.339 --> 00:07:43.339
And here's another thing. When the theme for this convention was being chosen, there was no coronavirus on the horizon.

00:07:43.339 --> 00:07:48.339
Yet, can you think of a better theme for a convention than this one?

00:07:48.339 --> 00:08:00.339
Joy. What an appropriate theme for a convention. Now, some of you have lost your jobs. Others have been very sick during the past few months.

00:08:00.339 --> 00:08:09.339
And a few of you have lost loved ones in death. There's no way you can be happy about those circumstances.

00:08:09.339 --> 00:08:18.339
But you can rejoice in your knowledge of Jehovah. You can rejoice in your knowledge of what Jehovah God has in store for us in the future.

00:08:18.339 --> 00:08:25.339
People outside don't have that. We do. We rejoice in Jehovah.

00:08:25.339 --> 00:08:35.340
And did you notice how well our convention program matched up with the theme for this year, the Eurotex, make disciples, baptizing them?

00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:40.340
We had so much information on how to improve on our teaching skills.

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:46.340
What do you think that is? Could it be that there's a lot more work to do in that respect?

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:55.340
Well, we don't know when the great tribulation is going to come, but we are determined to keep busy until the end does come.

00:08:55.340 --> 00:09:05.340
It wasn't a good idea to have us follow the progress of a Bible student, Jade, as Nita, overcame one challenge after another.

00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:14.340
That was realistic, wasn't it? And what a transformation. Jade isn't jaded anymore.

00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:27.340
And there was a subtle message in those videos. We should never, ever trust first impressions. First impressions can be wrong.

00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:35.340
Well, whether you're conducting a study right now or not, I'm sure you can hardly wait to get back to the field to apply some of those suggestions.

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:39.340
What a wonderful part of the program that was.

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:45.340
But what about other parts of the program? Do you remember some of these highlights? Let's watch.

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:58.049
There are millions of Jehovah's Witnesses around the world, each finding a way to be joyful.

00:09:58.049 --> 00:10:06.100
Despite the trials we face, we can find joy.

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:19.220
In the choices we're making, in the families we're raising, from the creation we're observing,

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:34.120
from the peace we're promoting, joy is found in the message we're preaching.

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:46.419
Jehovah promises us joy, despite the trials we're enduring and persecution we're facing.

00:10:46.419 --> 00:10:51.419
He promises us joy through the stand we're taking.

00:10:51.419 --> 00:10:57.419
Through anything in life, you can find joy in Jehovah.

00:10:57.419 --> 00:11:06.419
He wants you to be happy. His joy can be yours now and forever.

00:11:06.419 --> 00:11:10.419
So will you accept it?

00:11:10.419 --> 00:11:23.909
Jehovah has the right to expect that we'll love him even more than we love our husband, our wife, our son or daughter or our parents.

00:11:23.909 --> 00:11:27.909
He also has the right to expect that we'll love him more than we love our job.

00:11:28.909 --> 00:11:33.909
A favorite hobby or maybe a sport that we're passionate about.

00:11:33.909 --> 00:11:37.909
Jehovah has to come first.

00:11:37.909 --> 00:11:45.480
Has your desire to put Jehovah first been tested during this pandemic?

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:50.480
You lost your job and you searched desperately for another one.

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:55.480
Finally, after a long search, you found one.

00:11:55.480 --> 00:12:02.480
But it was a job that would require you to miss all your meetings and opportunities for field service.

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:07.480
What a temptation to take that job. You went out of work for months.

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:13.480
You felt helpless because a family member is supposed to provide for his family.

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:18.480
He would take a lot of faith for you to refuse that job.

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:27.480
And then wait. Hold on a little longer to see what Jehovah would work out for you.

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:33.480
Showing that Jehovah has to come first, even when it comes to providing for our family.

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:40.480
We have the example of the Jews who were returning from Babylon to Jerusalem.

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:45.480
Now, captivity in Babylon wasn't as harsh as slavery in Egypt.

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:54.480
Jews in Babylon could build a house, run a business, plant a vineyard, get comfortable in life.

00:12:54.480 --> 00:13:00.480
Some of them even got rich. Scholars believe that it was in Babylon,

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:05.480
that the Jews learned about the art of buying and selling trade and commerce.

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:13.480
So it would take real faith on their part to leave their house, their business,

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:18.480
close friends and relatives who wanted to remain in Babylon.

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:24.480
And go to Jerusalem, a city with none of the glitz of Babylon,

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:32.480
a city that most of them had never seen, that would take real faith.

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:36.480
Well, the returning Jews got off to a great start.

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:40.480
They constructed the foundation of the temple.

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:45.480
But then they ran into problems. There was danger.

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:50.480
And so how would they show that Jehovah comes first in the face of danger?

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:56.480
Well, they keep on building the temple in spite of the danger. But what did they do?

00:13:56.480 --> 00:14:00.480
Well, they got scared.

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:06.480
And they talked themselves into believing that it mustn't be Jehovah's will for them to build the temple.

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:10.480
Why not? Because it was hard.

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:16.480
So they started looking after themselves, looking after their own interests.

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:20.480
Now remember in Jerusalem, it was in ruins.

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:28.480
It wasn't going to be easy to start a business, plant crops, and build a house in a ruined city.

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:35.480
But they didn't say, oh, this is hard. So it mustn't be Jehovah's will for me to feed my family.

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:38.480
They found a way to feed their family.

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:47.480
Well, they should have had the same determination when it came to Jehovah's worship because Jehovah has to come first.

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:55.480
Now these were good people. They had had enough faith to leave Babylon and return to Jerusalem in the first place.

00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:58.480
But that first love had cooled off.

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:04.480
And let's see how Jehovah felt about that. Let's turn to Haggai, chapter 1.

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:08.480
We're going to read a few verses at Haggai, so keep your Bibles open there, please.

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:11.480
We're going to turn to Haggai, chapter 1.

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:20.480
And first of all, we're going to read verses 2 through 6 to see how Jehovah felt about this choice that the Jews had made,

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:26.480
putting themselves ahead of his worship in spite of danger.

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:37.480
This is what Jehovah of Army says. These people say, the time has not yet come for the house of Jehovah to be built.

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:41.480
And the word of Jehovah again came through Haggai the Prophet, saying,

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:49.480
Is it the time for you to dwell in your panelled houses while this house lies in ruins?

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:55.480
Now this is what Jehovah of Army says. Set your heart on your ways.

00:15:55.480 --> 00:16:02.480
You have so much seed, but you harvest little. You eat, but it is not the satisfaction.

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:09.480
You drink, but you do not drink your fill. You put on clothing, but no one gets warm.

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:17.480
The one who hires himself out puts his wages in a bag full of holes.

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:21.480
Now, do you think Jehovah didn't want them to build a house?

00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:29.480
Feed their family? Of course not, but Jehovah's worship has to come first.

00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:33.480
That's what exclusive devotion is all about.

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:37.480
Well, what else do we learn from these verses? What's Jehovah telling the people?

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:43.480
He's saying, look at you. Your work can work and work. You're not getting anywhere.

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:51.480
You aren't getting rich, and you aren't even making ends meet. Why not?

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:58.480
They didn't have the blessing of Jehovah, and it is the blessing of Jehovah that makes rich.

00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:04.480
Now, one of the scenes from our dramatic Bible reading illustrates this point very well.

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:08.480
Let's remind ourselves, let's have a look.

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:17.480
Jehovah compares the results of the Jews' self-centered efforts to those of a hired worker who puts his wages into a moth eaten sack.

00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:23.480
Because the Jews are neglecting the house of Jehovah, he holds back his blessing.

00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:29.480
The results of the Jews' labor are limited, and their lives lack joy.

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:35.480
Evidently, some try to feel that void by beautifying their own homes.

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:40.480
But material things cannot satisfy spiritual needs.

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:46.480
Can we see the warning here for us? It's not wrong to enjoy nice things.

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:56.480
But material things cannot bring us true and lasting joy, especially if we neglect Jehovah's work to obtain them.

00:17:56.480 --> 00:18:04.460
Now, there's nothing wrong with buying new things. I don't think many of us still have a black and white TV.

00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:09.460
The point is, Jehovah must come first.

00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:14.460
And remember, the Jews were facing stiff opposition. There was danger.

00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:19.460
So I want you to notice a little detail as we read Haggai 1, 7, and 8.

00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:23.460
I told you to keep your Bibles open, I didn't, but I have forgot it again.

00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:26.460
Haggai 1, verses 7 and 8.

00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:32.460
Now, notice the Jews are in danger. There are opposers.

00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:40.460
But we're looking for a little detail that should have reassured the Jews in verses 7 and 8.

00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:46.460
This is what Jehovah of armies says.

00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:55.460
Set your heart on your ways. Go up to the mountain and bring in lumber and build the house so that I may take pleasure in it.

00:18:55.460 --> 00:19:01.460
And I may be glorified, Jehovah says. Did you see it?

00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:08.460
Jehovah of armies? Now, that expression is repeated over and over again in the book of Haggai.

00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:15.460
And it should have reassured the Jews that their enemies were nothing in comparison with Jehovah

00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:20.460
and his armies. This is Jehovah telling the Jews.

00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:32.180
Go ahead, build the temple. I have your back. Find your greatest joy in Jehovah.

00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:37.180
That's really the theme that we're talking about today. Let's talk about it.

00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:42.180
And let's talk about some aspects of this very important theme.

00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:46.180
First of all, we'll talk about our relationship with Jehovah. That's so important.

00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:54.180
In the introduction to this talk, we mentioned David. He had a lot of problems, maybe more than most of us.

00:19:54.180 --> 00:20:01.180
And yet, he never lost his joy. He found joy in his relationship with Jehovah.

00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:06.180
Now, his physical living conditions weren't always the best.

00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:13.180
When King Saul was alive, a David was on the run most of the time. Where did he sleep?

00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:19.180
In a cave. In a place difficult to approach. Just anywhere that was safe.

00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:25.180
And then, at times, David and his men ran low on food. Sometimes they ran out of food.

00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:31.180
Do you know the feeling? Have you been low on food during this pandemic?

00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:37.180
David couldn't even enjoy a normal married life because he'd married the daughter of Saul,

00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:43.180
but then Saul had given her to another man. So what got him through all that?

00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:49.180
His relationship with Jehovah. Jehovah was the constant in his life.

00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:56.180
And you can just feel the unbreakable bond between Jehovah and David when you read the 16th Psalm.

00:20:56.180 --> 00:21:00.180
Now, there's something very interesting about this Psalm. Let's turn there.

00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:06.329
And first of all, we're just going to look at verse 1 briefly.

00:21:06.329 --> 00:21:15.279
Psalm 16. And notice in verse 1, the situation that David is in.

00:21:15.279 --> 00:21:25.279
He is in need of protection. In some unsated way, David is in danger.

00:21:25.279 --> 00:21:31.279
But you know what's interesting about this Psalm? For the rest of it, he doesn't dwell on his problems.

00:21:31.279 --> 00:21:39.279
He dwells on the way Jehovah is helping him with his problems. Notice verse 8.

00:21:39.279 --> 00:21:51.279
David says, I keep Jehovah before me constantly. Because he is at my right hand, I will never be shaken.

00:21:51.279 --> 00:21:58.279
So with his eyes of faith, David could see Jehovah beside him, protecting him.

00:21:58.279 --> 00:22:04.279
Now, if we can have that vision, we're not going to be afraid of anything or anyone. Are we?

00:22:04.279 --> 00:22:13.279
Now, find your greatest Jehovah. Here's a man who is in need of protection. Here's a man who feels he's in danger. Notice verse 9.

00:22:13.279 --> 00:22:21.279
So my heart rejoices. My whole being is joyful. And I reside in security.

00:22:21.279 --> 00:22:27.279
He's in danger in some way, and yet he feels safe. He feels secure.

00:22:27.279 --> 00:22:32.279
And then, notice verse 10. Usually, we apply verse 10 to the resurrection of Jesus.

00:22:32.279 --> 00:22:39.279
But think of it from David's perspective. For you will not leave me in the grave.

00:22:39.279 --> 00:22:47.279
David knew that even if somehow he were to die, Jehovah would not leave him in the grave. He would resurrect him.

00:22:47.279 --> 00:22:56.279
At the end of verse 11, beautiful expression. In your presence is abundant joy.

00:22:56.279 --> 00:23:08.329
Do you notice the expressions? My heart rejoices. My whole being is joyful. In your presence is abundant joy.

00:23:08.329 --> 00:23:15.329
David's life wasn't always easy, but feeling that he was in the presence of Jehovah,

00:23:15.329 --> 00:23:22.329
feeling the support of Jehovah helped him to get through it, and to get through it with joy.

00:23:22.329 --> 00:23:30.329
Well, your life isn't always easy. I'm sure you've had many anxious moments during this pandemic.

00:23:30.329 --> 00:23:42.329
But then, you turn away from your problems. You focused on Jehovah God, and you reset your joy returned.

00:23:42.329 --> 00:23:49.859
How many reasons for joy can you think of? The song says they're abundant.

00:23:49.859 --> 00:23:56.859
Let's think of a few. Here's one. Jesus said, no man.

00:23:56.859 --> 00:24:04.859
No man can come to me unless the Father draws him. Now think what that means.

00:24:04.859 --> 00:24:14.859
Jehovah saw something in you that he loves. He looked down, and he said, I want that person in the new world.

00:24:14.859 --> 00:24:26.460
Don't try to argue with Jehovah. Don't say, you made a mistake. You don't mean me. You must mean the Father next to me, but me, I'm not worth it.

00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:39.869
Jehovah drew you to the truth. Accept it. Accept it. God loves you.

00:24:39.869 --> 00:24:47.869
Now that is a reason for joy. Another reason for joy is that Jehovah answers our prayers.

00:24:47.869 --> 00:24:54.869
He's always available, always ready to listen. We can pray in any language at any time.

00:24:54.869 --> 00:25:01.869
Now, Jehovah won't always do what we ask him to do, but he will always listen.

00:25:01.869 --> 00:25:07.869
We find joy in Jehovah's service because he's reasonable in what he expects of us.

00:25:07.869 --> 00:25:14.869
You come home after a long day's work. You're exhausted. Worn out. Stressed out.

00:25:14.869 --> 00:25:22.869
You come home from field service or from a meeting. You're refreshed. Jehovah is reasonable.

00:25:22.869 --> 00:25:29.869
We're also confident that Jehovah will provide our food and clothing no matter how dire the situation gets.

00:25:29.869 --> 00:25:37.869
Now, what he provides might not always be fancy, but it'll always be enough. It'll always be adequate to get us through.

00:25:37.869 --> 00:25:44.869
And we should always be grateful for anything Jehovah provides, no matter how simple it might be.

00:25:44.869 --> 00:25:53.869
A researcher once drew a distinction between Jehovah's witnesses and some others who were in concentration camps in Nazi Germany.

00:25:53.869 --> 00:26:02.869
An unwitness might say, where is the God? All I have to eat is this miserable piece of bread.

00:26:02.869 --> 00:26:13.869
A witness in the same camp might say, oh Jehovah, thank you. I have a piece of bread to eat. I can eat.

00:26:13.869 --> 00:26:23.869
And regain my strength and live just a little longer to serve you, and maybe I'll be able to share some of my bread with someone else.

00:26:23.869 --> 00:26:30.869
The conclusion of the researcher will receive the piece of bread, but it was all in the point of view.

00:26:30.869 --> 00:26:41.869
The witness had a spiritual point of view, and the witness was grateful for even a simple provision that Jehovah had made.

00:26:41.869 --> 00:26:50.869
Well, during this pandemic, it could be that your menu has been greatly simplified. Maybe you haven't been able to eat the way you would normally eat.

00:26:50.869 --> 00:27:00.869
If you had just pasta or rice to eat, you didn't say, look at this. All I have to eat is pasta. All I have to eat is rice.

00:27:00.869 --> 00:27:09.869
You thanked Jehovah for the rice or for the pasta. You were grateful for the provisions, and you realized that no matter how simple,

00:27:09.869 --> 00:27:29.869
these provisions came from Jehovah. Jehovah has also given us a loving spiritual family, and I think many of us have come to the conclusion that we never really understood what a loving spiritual family we have until this pandemic.

00:27:29.869 --> 00:27:40.869
A young married couple were both afflicted with the coronavirus. Both of them, well how would they eat? They couldn't go out shopping, and they couldn't see anyone.

00:27:40.869 --> 00:27:55.869
The brother said, we had groceries at the door constantly. The wife says, I felt I had Jehovah's, and everyone else's arms wrapped around me.

00:27:56.869 --> 00:28:04.869
Social distancing doesn't apply to Jehovah. He can wrap his arms around anyone.

00:28:04.869 --> 00:28:12.869
Many of our brothers have been reconnecting with long-last return visits, and I'm believing family members and starting Bible studies with them.

00:28:12.869 --> 00:28:22.869
And as you probably know, meeting attendance has increased, and inactive and disfellowship persons are also trying to draw close to Jehovah.

00:28:22.869 --> 00:28:31.869
One disfellowship person said, I view this as one last warning from Jehovah.

00:28:31.869 --> 00:28:39.869
Now just a word to any who may be listening, who are no longer serving Jehovah.

00:28:39.869 --> 00:28:49.869
What are you waiting for? God loves you. God wants you to return. He wants to put his arms around you once more.

00:28:49.869 --> 00:28:54.869
So please, take advantage of the invitation and come back.

00:28:54.869 --> 00:29:05.869
And please, don't give in to the idea, well I've done nothing up to now, and now there's been a pandemic, and if I come back to the truth, well Jehovah's not going to accept me.

00:29:05.869 --> 00:29:18.869
Read your Bible. You'll find that in many cases it was a disaster of some sort that caused people to come to their senses and return to Jehovah, and Jehovah lovingly accepted them.

00:29:18.869 --> 00:29:29.869
Think of Manasseh as an example. Many have commented that they've actually drawn closer to their brothers and sisters during this pandemic.

00:29:29.869 --> 00:29:35.869
Many, many say, I feel more cared for than ever.

00:29:35.869 --> 00:29:42.869
We find joy in our relationship with Jehovah and with our brothers.

00:29:43.869 --> 00:29:54.869
Now we were talking about David. He said in Psalm 16 that there is abundant joy in Jehovah, but what was his joy based on?

00:29:54.869 --> 00:30:03.869
It wasn't based on his privileges. David didn't become king for years, but it was on his relationship with Jehovah.

00:30:03.869 --> 00:30:10.869
So this is a good example for us. It may be that there is a privilege that you've been expecting that seems a long time coming.

00:30:10.869 --> 00:30:18.869
What do you do in the meantime? Keep working on your relationship with Jehovah. Keep strengthening that relationship.

00:30:18.869 --> 00:30:32.869
It'll be the best investment you've ever made. And don't forget, the greatest privilege any of us can have is to bear the name of Jehovah, to be called one of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:30:32.869 --> 00:30:41.869
And we're part of a family of brothers and sisters who love us and who would even risk their lives for us.

00:30:41.869 --> 00:30:47.869
So we've discussed finding joy in our relationship with Jehovah.

00:30:47.869 --> 00:30:58.869
Let's consider a second aspect. And that is finding joy in the Bible, finding joy in God's written Word.

00:30:58.869 --> 00:31:04.869
We get to know Jehovah best by reading His Word and meditating on it.

00:31:04.869 --> 00:31:10.869
Now in recent times, the congregation Bible reading has been shortened. And there's a good reason for that.

00:31:10.869 --> 00:31:15.869
It's not so we can get our Bible reading over with and get on to other things.

00:31:15.869 --> 00:31:24.869
It's so that we will take our time, slow down, meditate on what we're reading, chew it up, digest it thoroughly.

00:31:24.869 --> 00:31:29.869
This is Jehovah talking to you and to me, sharing His thoughts with us.

00:31:29.869 --> 00:31:33.869
This is amazing and we need to appreciate it.

00:31:33.869 --> 00:31:44.869
Now one way that we can enjoy our Bible reading is to make the connection between what we're reading now and what we've read in the past and see how they match up.

00:31:44.869 --> 00:31:49.869
Let's take an example, just a short one. Turn to Numbers, chapter 12.

00:31:49.869 --> 00:31:58.589
Numbers, chapter 12. And verses 1 and 2.

00:31:58.589 --> 00:32:04.589
I think the setting is pretty self-explanatory. So Numbers, chapter 12, verses 1 and 2.

00:32:04.589 --> 00:32:17.740
Now Miriam and Aaron began to speak against Moses because of the Cushite wife he had married for he had taken a Cushite wife.

00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:22.740
They were saying, is it only by Moses that Jehovah has spoken?

00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:29.049
Has he not also spoken through us? So what was their argument?

00:32:29.049 --> 00:32:39.049
Basically, in plain English, their argument was that Moses was hogging the limelight, that he wanted to be the center of attention.

00:32:39.049 --> 00:32:42.049
And now is that true?

00:32:42.049 --> 00:32:47.049
In the previous chapter, chapter 11, what do we read?

00:32:47.049 --> 00:32:56.049
Moses willingly shares his authority with 70 of the men of the elders of Israel.

00:32:56.049 --> 00:33:02.049
So there was no serious question about Moses wanting to have the limelight.

00:33:02.049 --> 00:33:05.049
Moses was a humble man.

00:33:05.049 --> 00:33:15.049
But now this is Numbers, chapter 12. This is Aaron questioning Moses' authority.

00:33:15.049 --> 00:33:23.049
But we can learn a little bit more about this from something that is tucked far away in the book of Deuteronomy.

00:33:23.049 --> 00:33:26.049
Let's turn to Deuteronomy, chapter 9.

00:33:26.049 --> 00:33:34.049
And we're going to see if we can learn something about Aaron and why Aaron's attitude was so shocking.

00:33:34.049 --> 00:33:38.049
Deuteronomy, chapter 9, and verse 20.

00:33:38.049 --> 00:33:43.789
This is a revelation.

00:33:43.789 --> 00:33:47.789
This is Moses in the very last month of his life talking to the Israelites.

00:33:47.789 --> 00:33:56.789
And he says, Jehovah was so angry with Aaron that he was ready to annihilate him.

00:33:56.789 --> 00:34:00.789
But I made supplication for Aaron.

00:34:01.789 --> 00:34:11.789
Aaron owed his life to Moses, and yet he dares question Moses' leadership of the nation of Israel.

00:34:11.789 --> 00:34:14.789
That is really shocking.

00:34:14.789 --> 00:34:17.789
Now, what does this teach you about Moses?

00:34:17.789 --> 00:34:20.789
He's a very humble man.

00:34:20.789 --> 00:34:23.789
And he's not quick to take credit for things.

00:34:23.789 --> 00:34:25.789
Now, why do we say that?

00:34:25.789 --> 00:34:29.789
When Moses wrote the book of Exodus and the story of the golden calf,

00:34:29.789 --> 00:34:38.389
he never mentioned that Jehovah wanted to annihilate Aaron for his part in the golden calf incident.

00:34:38.389 --> 00:34:44.389
Aaron was still alive, and Moses spared Aaron that indignity.

00:34:44.389 --> 00:34:53.389
It's only after Aaron's death, and in the very last month of Moses' life that we learn about it.

00:34:53.389 --> 00:34:58.389
Doesn't that tell you something about how kind and humble Moses was?

00:34:58.389 --> 00:35:06.389
So this is just to illustrate the fact that if we try to take one point that we've learned in the past

00:35:06.389 --> 00:35:12.389
and connect it up with what we're reading now, it will often help the Bible reading to come alive.

00:35:12.389 --> 00:35:17.389
Now, let's consider some of the things that God's Word has done for us.

00:35:17.389 --> 00:35:21.389
Do you remember what it was like before you came into the truth?

00:35:22.389 --> 00:35:28.389
A favorite relative of yours who was happily married lost her husband in death.

00:35:28.389 --> 00:35:34.389
At the funeral, a priest told her that her husband was in purgatory,

00:35:34.389 --> 00:35:39.389
and unless the widow paid up, he was going to stay there for a long time.

00:35:39.389 --> 00:35:44.389
She just lost her husband. How comforting was that?

00:35:44.389 --> 00:35:47.389
But then you started studying the Bible.

00:35:47.389 --> 00:35:52.389
You came to Romans chapter 6 and verse 7.

00:35:52.389 --> 00:36:00.389
The one who has died has been acquitted from his sin, acquitted from his sin,

00:36:00.389 --> 00:36:03.389
and your Bible teacher explained what that means.

00:36:03.389 --> 00:36:07.389
It means that when you die, the dead is paid.

00:36:07.389 --> 00:36:10.389
You don't go on paying after death.

00:36:10.389 --> 00:36:15.389
You don't suffer in hell, and you don't suffer in purgatory.

00:36:15.389 --> 00:36:21.389
That one Bible verse could completely change your view of what happens at death.

00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:28.960
On the other hand, maybe you grew up in a family where evolution was the order of the day.

00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:32.960
So no hope, no hope for the future.

00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:35.960
This life is all there is.

00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:41.960
Then you came to learn that you have a Heavenly Father who loves you very much

00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:44.960
and who wants to give you a future and a hope.

00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:49.960
What a joy it was to discover Jehovah.

00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:53.960
Some of us grew up in a family where the parents didn't get along so well.

00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:58.960
We couldn't point to them and say now that is how a man should treat his wife.

00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:02.960
Or that is how a woman should treat her husband.

00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:04.960
They just didn't get along.

00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:07.960
We needed Jehovah. We needed the Bible.

00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:13.960
We needed Jehovah's organization to teach us how to have a happy family life.

00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:15.960
There's more.

00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:22.960
Recently a clergyman was asked by a journalist why pandemics like the coronavirus occur.

00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:28.960
And the clergyman answered, well, suffering is part of life.

00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:30.960
That didn't answer the question.

00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:33.960
The journalist wasn't asking, do we suffer?

00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:36.960
The journalist knew that we suffer.

00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:39.960
The journalist wanted to know, why do we suffer?

00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:42.960
He didn't get an answer.

00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:46.960
A professor of New Testament theology was asked the same question.

00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:50.960
Why do we suffer? Do you know what he said?

00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:55.960
Everybody suffers. God suffers.

00:37:55.960 --> 00:37:57.960
What kind of an answer is that?

00:37:57.960 --> 00:38:03.960
How happy we are to have the answers to those questions from the Bible.

00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:06.960
Now speaking about God's written word,

00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:16.960
since 1966, Jehovah's organization has made the Bible come alive in the most outstanding way through the Bible dramas.

00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:19.960
It really has made the Bible come alive, hasn't it?

00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:22.960
It's helped us to visualize what life was like in Bible times.

00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:29.960
And we've come to realize that people living in Bible times weren't really so very different from people who were living today.

00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:34.960
Let's review a few scenes and see what lessons we can glean.

00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:47.860
Hey Ham, we had a visitor last night.

00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:57.079
It was your wife, or should I say your former wife?

00:38:57.079 --> 00:39:03.420
Hey Ham, don't you care how you've hurt your innocent mate?

00:39:03.420 --> 00:39:05.420
How can you be so hard-hearted?

00:39:05.420 --> 00:39:08.420
Look, Moses said if you find something indecent with your wife,

00:39:08.420 --> 00:39:12.420
a man must write a certificate of divorce, hand it to her, and dismiss her.

00:39:12.420 --> 00:39:16.420
If giving me no children is an indecent, then what is?

00:39:17.420 --> 00:39:19.420
Besides, I'm tired of living with her.

00:39:19.420 --> 00:39:21.420
I'm marrying Gisla today.

00:39:21.420 --> 00:39:23.420
Gisla.

00:39:23.420 --> 00:39:26.420
That Moe by girl?

00:39:26.420 --> 00:39:30.420
I heard you bind yourself with an oath and a curse not to take away from the nations.

00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:35.420
God's law says they will turn your sons away from following me to serve other gods.

00:39:35.420 --> 00:39:37.420
Then Jehovah's anger will blaze against you.

00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:40.420
Who are you to counsel me?

00:39:40.420 --> 00:39:44.420
Every man must find his own joy, and I intend to find mine.

00:39:44.420 --> 00:39:49.420
Ray Ham, only Jehovah can give true joy.

00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:52.420
Do you really think you can give yourself more joy than he can?

00:39:52.420 --> 00:40:02.139
What's the lesson?

00:40:02.139 --> 00:40:07.139
Our greatest joy comes when we obey Jehovah.

00:40:07.139 --> 00:40:09.139
Let's look again.

00:40:09.139 --> 00:40:19.039
Come back here.

00:40:19.039 --> 00:40:22.039
You have to listen to me. I'm your father.

00:40:22.039 --> 00:40:24.039
What's wrong with your children?

00:40:24.039 --> 00:40:27.039
They don't like coming to the temple.

00:40:27.039 --> 00:40:30.039
Oh, sweetie.

00:40:30.039 --> 00:40:32.039
Why don't you like it?

00:40:32.039 --> 00:40:39.070
Come back here now.

00:40:39.070 --> 00:40:41.070
I'm sorry, my lord.

00:40:41.070 --> 00:40:44.539
My wife speaks very little Hebrew.

00:40:44.539 --> 00:40:45.539
Did you not swear?

00:40:45.539 --> 00:40:48.539
Never to marry someone who doesn't serve Jehovah?

00:40:48.539 --> 00:40:51.539
Nehemiah, nobody cares.

00:40:51.539 --> 00:40:53.539
Did you not?

00:40:53.539 --> 00:40:54.539
Yes, yes.

00:40:54.539 --> 00:40:58.539
Why have you ignored the command of Jehovah and your own oath?

00:40:58.539 --> 00:40:59.539
Let me go.

00:40:59.539 --> 00:41:01.539
No wonder your children don't love Jehovah.

00:41:01.539 --> 00:41:03.539
Hold on.

00:41:03.539 --> 00:41:06.539
Did you imagine that you could succeed without Jehovah's blessing?

00:41:06.539 --> 00:41:08.539
I prayed for Jehovah's blessing.

00:41:08.539 --> 00:41:09.539
Did you?

00:41:09.539 --> 00:41:11.539
But you didn't obey him.

00:41:11.539 --> 00:41:21.730
Ray Ham, how can Jehovah bless something that is against his will?

00:41:21.730 --> 00:41:23.730
And the lesson here?

00:41:23.730 --> 00:41:27.730
Jehovah doesn't answer prayers that are not in harmony with his will.

00:41:27.730 --> 00:41:37.380
And again.

00:41:37.380 --> 00:41:39.380
What was that all about?

00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:45.789
Ray Ham refuses to move into Jerusalem.

00:41:45.789 --> 00:41:47.789
And he wants us to support him.

00:41:47.789 --> 00:41:51.519
What did you say?

00:41:51.519 --> 00:41:55.989
I told him, he is doing Jehovah's will.

00:41:55.989 --> 00:42:00.989
Ray Ham doesn't understand how happy he could be if you just followed Jehovah's direction.

00:42:00.989 --> 00:42:09.409
So we will move if we are selected.

00:42:09.409 --> 00:42:12.489
Yes.

00:42:12.489 --> 00:42:17.489
I'd rather be like Nehemiah and like Ray Ham.

00:42:17.489 --> 00:42:18.489
Do you agree?

00:42:18.489 --> 00:42:24.800
Yes.

00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:26.800
The lesson?

00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:31.800
Happy families follow Jehovah's direction.

00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:35.800
Well, there are a lot more lessons to be learned from this drama.

00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:39.800
And you can discover them as you review it at home.

00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:41.800
You guessed it.

00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:44.800
We're releasing the drama today.

00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:47.800
You can access it following this talk.

00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:51.800
The chairman will show you how.

00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:53.800
You may applaud.

00:42:53.800 --> 00:43:00.969
So we find joy in our relationship with Jehovah.

00:43:00.969 --> 00:43:06.969
We find joy in studying his word and discovering beautiful things in his word.

00:43:06.969 --> 00:43:09.969
Now, what about Jehovah's name?

00:43:09.969 --> 00:43:14.969
Can we find joy in Jehovah's name as well?

00:43:14.969 --> 00:43:17.969
Particularly in the last few years.

00:43:17.969 --> 00:43:21.969
A lot of emphasis has been placed on Jehovah's name at Warwick.

00:43:21.969 --> 00:43:26.969
In the museum, we even have an exhibit about the divine name.

00:43:26.969 --> 00:43:29.969
Now, what do you suppose that is?

00:43:29.969 --> 00:43:33.969
I think there's so much emphasis on God's name.

00:43:33.969 --> 00:43:36.969
Well, Jehovah loves his name.

00:43:36.969 --> 00:43:39.969
And he loves those who love his name.

00:43:39.969 --> 00:43:47.340
That's something we discover when we read Malachi chapter 3.

00:43:47.340 --> 00:43:57.130
Malachi chapter 3 and verse 16.

00:43:57.130 --> 00:43:59.130
I'll give you a moment.

00:43:59.130 --> 00:44:05.619
Malachi chapter 3 and verse 16.

00:44:05.619 --> 00:44:10.619
At that time, those who fear Jehovah spoke with one another.

00:44:10.619 --> 00:44:12.619
Each one with his companion.

00:44:12.619 --> 00:44:16.619
And Jehovah kept paying attention and listening.

00:44:16.619 --> 00:44:20.619
And a book of remembrance was written before him.

00:44:20.619 --> 00:44:23.619
For those fearing Jehovah, and notice this.

00:44:23.619 --> 00:44:29.619
And for those meditating on his name.

00:44:29.619 --> 00:44:36.619
And then in chapter 4 and verse 2, Jehovah praises those who honor his name.

00:44:36.619 --> 00:44:38.619
Now, let's go back to this expression.

00:44:38.619 --> 00:44:41.619
Those meditating on his name.

00:44:41.619 --> 00:44:43.619
What do you think that means?

00:44:43.619 --> 00:44:48.619
Surely, it means more than just accepting that God has a name.

00:44:48.619 --> 00:44:50.619
We know that.

00:44:50.619 --> 00:44:55.619
The Jews and Malachi's day, even the unfaithful ones, knew that.

00:44:56.619 --> 00:45:01.619
But surely, it means meditating on the meaning of God's name.

00:45:01.619 --> 00:45:08.619
And meditating on the rule that we can have in vindicating his name.

00:45:08.619 --> 00:45:15.619
As you know, many scholars believe that Jehovah's name means he causes to become.

00:45:15.619 --> 00:45:19.619
Jehovah can become whatever he needs to become.

00:45:19.619 --> 00:45:24.619
And he can make you become whatever he needs you to be.

00:45:24.619 --> 00:45:27.619
Now, in the days of Israel, what did Jehovah need?

00:45:27.619 --> 00:45:33.619
Often, he needed prophets, order to get them from ordinary people.

00:45:33.619 --> 00:45:39.619
He took a very shy young man named Jeremiah and turned him into a bold and courageous prophet.

00:45:39.619 --> 00:45:43.619
And he did the same with a farmer named Amos.

00:45:43.619 --> 00:45:49.619
Don't tell Jehovah what you can and can't do.

00:45:49.619 --> 00:45:53.619
You might be surprised about what you can do.

00:45:53.619 --> 00:45:59.619
If you just put yourself in Jehovah's hands, how many in this audience?

00:45:59.619 --> 00:46:04.619
One said, I could never preach and order door.

00:46:04.619 --> 00:46:06.619
I could never pioneer.

00:46:06.619 --> 00:46:09.619
I could never be a missionary.

00:46:09.619 --> 00:46:13.619
I could never serve with a need is great.

00:46:13.619 --> 00:46:17.619
Well, Jehovah knew better.

00:46:17.619 --> 00:46:21.619
We can trust Jehovah in what he promises to do.

00:46:21.619 --> 00:46:24.619
He will always keep his promises.

00:46:24.619 --> 00:46:29.619
Now, when you go through the Hebrew scriptures, you find certain expressions over and over again.

00:46:29.619 --> 00:46:31.619
The Jews rebel against Jehovah.

00:46:31.619 --> 00:46:34.619
They do terrible things, sometimes disgusting things.

00:46:34.619 --> 00:46:40.619
And you, the reader, are saying, Jehovah, you really ought to annihilate these people.

00:46:40.619 --> 00:46:43.619
It's terrible what they're doing.

00:46:43.619 --> 00:46:46.619
But then, Jehovah reconsideres.

00:46:46.619 --> 00:46:48.619
Why?

00:46:49.619 --> 00:46:52.619
For the sake of my promise that I made to Abraham.

00:46:52.619 --> 00:46:56.619
For the sake of the covenant that I made with my servant David.

00:46:56.619 --> 00:47:00.619
For the sake of my name.

00:47:00.619 --> 00:47:05.619
To Jehovah, a promise is a promise.

00:47:05.619 --> 00:47:11.619
He promised Abraham and David that he wouldn't forsake their offspring.

00:47:11.619 --> 00:47:13.619
And he meant what he said.

00:47:13.619 --> 00:47:15.619
Now, think what that means.

00:47:15.619 --> 00:47:19.619
Nothing will make Jehovah go back on his word.

00:47:19.619 --> 00:47:24.619
When Jehovah promises that he's going to take this earth and turn it into a paradise,

00:47:24.619 --> 00:47:26.619
you can take that to the bank.

00:47:26.619 --> 00:47:30.619
Jehovah will keep his promise.

00:47:30.619 --> 00:47:35.619
Well, how has Jehovah shown that a promise is a promise during this convention?

00:47:35.619 --> 00:47:38.619
What did he promise?

00:47:38.619 --> 00:47:41.619
My servants will eat.

00:47:41.619 --> 00:47:45.619
And the governing body had to find a way to serve the food.

00:47:45.619 --> 00:47:47.619
Jehovah provided the food.

00:47:47.619 --> 00:47:49.619
He provided it in abundance.

00:47:49.619 --> 00:47:51.619
And we thank him for it.

00:47:51.619 --> 00:47:57.619
All praise goes to Jehovah for this convention program.

00:47:57.619 --> 00:48:00.619
Now, when we first discovered that God has a name,

00:48:00.619 --> 00:48:03.619
it was a turning point for many of us.

00:48:03.619 --> 00:48:06.619
A circuit over here was going from door to door one morning.

00:48:06.619 --> 00:48:09.619
And at one door, a teenage boy answered,

00:48:09.619 --> 00:48:12.619
he announced that his parents were not at home.

00:48:12.619 --> 00:48:14.619
And the circuit overseer said,

00:48:14.619 --> 00:48:18.619
well, just before I leave, I like to show you something.

00:48:18.619 --> 00:48:22.619
And he showed the boy, Jehovah's name, in the Bible.

00:48:22.619 --> 00:48:25.619
Psalm 8318.

00:48:25.619 --> 00:48:28.619
The boy took the Bible to have a closer look.

00:48:28.619 --> 00:48:34.619
Turned around, went into the house, and shut the door.

00:48:34.619 --> 00:48:37.619
With the circuit oversees Bible.

00:48:37.619 --> 00:48:41.619
The circuit overseer waited, and waited.

00:48:41.619 --> 00:48:44.619
And he thought he'd lost his Bible.

00:48:44.619 --> 00:48:47.619
But then the boy's mother came to the door.

00:48:47.619 --> 00:48:50.619
And she apologized for pretending that she wasn't home.

00:48:50.619 --> 00:48:56.619
But she said she had been astonished to learn that God has a name.

00:48:56.619 --> 00:49:00.619
That led to a good witness.

00:49:00.619 --> 00:49:03.619
Well, what else do we know about God's name?

00:49:03.619 --> 00:49:06.619
The Bible says that the name of Jehovah

00:49:06.619 --> 00:49:08.619
is a strong tower.

00:49:08.619 --> 00:49:12.619
And we're going to be able to count on Jehovah

00:49:12.619 --> 00:49:15.619
during the attack of Gog of May Gog.

00:49:15.619 --> 00:49:17.619
When Gog attacks,

00:49:17.619 --> 00:49:20.619
Jehovah is going to vindicate himself.

00:49:20.619 --> 00:49:25.619
He is going to protect his people for the sake of his name.

00:49:25.619 --> 00:49:29.619
And that's another reason for us to love Jehovah's name,

00:49:29.619 --> 00:49:31.619
to rejoice in his name.

00:49:31.619 --> 00:49:35.619
Because his name is involved, Jehovah is going to protect his people.

00:49:35.619 --> 00:49:39.619
Well, when we talk about the attack of Gog of May Gog,

00:49:39.619 --> 00:49:42.619
does it make you kind of nervous?

00:49:42.619 --> 00:49:45.619
Here are a couple of things to think about.

00:49:45.619 --> 00:49:51.619
First of all, who's idea is it for Gog to attack when he does?

00:49:51.619 --> 00:49:53.619
Let's find out.

00:49:53.619 --> 00:49:55.619
Ezekiel chapter 38.

00:49:55.619 --> 00:50:04.929
And we're going to start with verse 4.

00:50:04.929 --> 00:50:07.929
Ezekiel 38, beginning with verse 4.

00:50:07.929 --> 00:50:16.929
Now this is Jehovah talking to that coalition of nations known collectively as Gog.

00:50:16.929 --> 00:50:20.929
And I want you to pay particular attention to the first part of the verse.

00:50:20.929 --> 00:50:22.929
That's verse 4.

00:50:22.929 --> 00:50:25.929
Jehovah says to Gog,

00:50:25.929 --> 00:50:29.929
I will turn you around

00:50:29.929 --> 00:50:33.929
and put hooks in your jaws

00:50:33.929 --> 00:50:39.929
and bring you out with all your army.

00:50:39.929 --> 00:50:41.929
Now think about that.

00:50:41.929 --> 00:50:44.929
I will turn you around.

00:50:44.929 --> 00:50:48.929
It sounds like Gog was headed in the opposite direction.

00:50:48.929 --> 00:50:53.929
But then Jehovah turns him around and he draws him out to attack.

00:50:53.929 --> 00:50:55.929
So what does that tell you?

00:50:55.929 --> 00:50:59.929
The timing of the attack is Jehovah's.

00:50:59.929 --> 00:51:04.929
Now that doesn't mean that Gog of May Gog had no intention of attacking Gog's people.

00:51:04.929 --> 00:51:07.929
He was planning to attack at some point.

00:51:07.929 --> 00:51:10.929
But it's the timing of the attack.

00:51:10.929 --> 00:51:11.929
That's Jehovah's.

00:51:11.929 --> 00:51:13.929
Now the pure worship book explains it this way.

00:51:13.929 --> 00:51:19.929
It says, as if putting hooks in Gog's jaws and leading him along.

00:51:19.929 --> 00:51:23.929
At some point, following the destruction of Babylon, the great,

00:51:23.929 --> 00:51:27.929
Jehovah may in some way lure the nations into carrying out

00:51:27.929 --> 00:51:30.929
what is already in their hearts.

00:51:30.929 --> 00:51:37.929
Jehovah will thus set the stage for the attack that leads to Armageddon.

00:51:37.929 --> 00:51:40.929
So what are we worried about?

00:51:40.929 --> 00:51:44.929
Everything is happening according to Jehovah's purpose.

00:51:44.929 --> 00:51:48.929
Now, when we read verses 10 through 12,

00:51:48.929 --> 00:51:52.929
we see what Gog has in mind.

00:51:53.929 --> 00:51:57.929
Ezekiel 38 verses 10 through 12.

00:51:57.929 --> 00:52:01.929
And then leave your Bibles open because we'll read one more verse.

00:52:01.929 --> 00:52:03.929
Verses 10 to 12.

00:52:03.929 --> 00:52:07.929
It says, this is what the sovereign Lord Jehovah says.

00:52:07.929 --> 00:52:11.929
In that day, thoughts will come into your heart.

00:52:11.929 --> 00:52:14.929
I wonder who put them there.

00:52:14.929 --> 00:52:17.929
And you will devise an evil plan.

00:52:17.929 --> 00:52:21.929
You will say, I will invade the land of unprotected settlements.

00:52:21.929 --> 00:52:25.929
I will come against those living in security without disturbance.

00:52:25.929 --> 00:52:31.929
All of them living in settlements unprotected by walls, bars, or gates.

00:52:31.929 --> 00:52:36.929
It will be to take much spoil and plunder.

00:52:36.929 --> 00:52:39.929
But how will it all work out?

00:52:39.929 --> 00:52:41.929
Verse 23.

00:52:41.929 --> 00:52:43.929
And I, that is Jehovah.

00:52:43.929 --> 00:52:48.929
I will certainly magnify myself and sanctify myself,

00:52:48.929 --> 00:52:52.929
and make myself known before the eyes of many nations.

00:52:52.929 --> 00:52:57.929
And they will have to know that I am Jehovah.

00:52:57.929 --> 00:52:59.929
So what do we learn?

00:52:59.929 --> 00:53:03.929
Everything is under control.

00:53:03.929 --> 00:53:05.929
There's no need to panic.

00:53:05.929 --> 00:53:08.929
Everything is going according to schedule.

00:53:08.929 --> 00:53:12.929
Jehovah's schedule.

00:53:12.929 --> 00:53:14.929
So that's the first thing.

00:53:14.929 --> 00:53:16.929
There's another thing.

00:53:16.929 --> 00:53:19.929
What precedes the attack of Gog of Megog?

00:53:19.929 --> 00:53:22.929
What did we read in the pure worship book?

00:53:22.929 --> 00:53:25.929
The destruction of Babel and the Great?

00:53:25.929 --> 00:53:31.929
Now, have you ever considered how that destruction is going to fortify your faith?

00:53:31.929 --> 00:53:37.929
Is going to strengthen you so that you're able to endure the attack of Gog of Megog?

00:53:37.929 --> 00:53:39.929
Think about it this way.

00:53:39.929 --> 00:53:42.929
What other religious organization

00:53:42.929 --> 00:53:48.929
foretells the destruction of a world empire of false religion?

00:53:48.929 --> 00:53:52.929
We're the only ones, because the others are all part of Babel and the Great.

00:53:52.929 --> 00:53:56.929
They're not going to foretell the destruction in the future.

00:53:56.929 --> 00:54:01.929
So the destruction is going to be a surprise to everyone, but Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:54:01.929 --> 00:54:07.929
And when it occurs, they'll be known out in your mind that you're on the winning side,

00:54:07.929 --> 00:54:10.929
that you're on Jehovah's side.

00:54:10.929 --> 00:54:14.929
Some brothers get all upset over some detail.

00:54:14.929 --> 00:54:17.929
They don't think the organization has the right take on.

00:54:17.929 --> 00:54:22.929
It might be the pronunciation of Gog's name, or the meaning of that name,

00:54:22.929 --> 00:54:25.929
or the meaning of a single verse in the Scriptures.

00:54:25.929 --> 00:54:29.929
They get all upset, they get obsessed over one detail,

00:54:29.929 --> 00:54:33.929
and it interferes with their worship.

00:54:33.929 --> 00:54:36.929
But when Babel and the Great goes down,

00:54:36.929 --> 00:54:43.929
will there be any doubt as to which channel Jehovah God has been using all this time to do his will?

00:54:43.929 --> 00:54:47.929
You will be so glad that you're on the winning side.

00:54:47.929 --> 00:54:56.269
Of course it is sobering to think about the final attack of Gog of Megog on Gog's people,

00:54:56.269 --> 00:54:59.269
but it shouldn't take away our joy.

00:54:59.269 --> 00:55:02.269
Nehemiah 8 verse 10.

00:55:02.269 --> 00:55:08.269
It says, the joy of Jehovah is your stronghold.

00:55:08.269 --> 00:55:12.269
Joy is actually a protection for us.

00:55:12.269 --> 00:55:16.269
Now did Nehemiah need a stronghold?

00:55:16.269 --> 00:55:18.269
You know the answer to that.

00:55:18.269 --> 00:55:21.269
His life was being threatened.

00:55:21.269 --> 00:55:25.269
Pagan inhabitants of the land wanted to kill him,

00:55:25.269 --> 00:55:28.269
and then there were problems in the congregation.

00:55:28.269 --> 00:55:31.269
The elders weren't respecting Jehovah's law on marriage,

00:55:31.269 --> 00:55:34.269
and the Sabbath wasn't being observed,

00:55:34.269 --> 00:55:38.269
and that was one of the reasons why the Jews went into captivity in the first place.

00:55:38.269 --> 00:55:45.269
There were problems, but Nehemiah didn't allow those problems to rob him of his joy.

00:55:45.269 --> 00:55:50.269
We too can be joyful, even when we're under a lot of pressure.

00:55:50.269 --> 00:55:56.269
Our joy doesn't depend on our circumstances.

00:55:56.269 --> 00:56:00.269
Joy helped Jesus to endure a torturous stake.

00:56:00.269 --> 00:56:06.269
Joy motivated the apostles to keep preaching even after they've been beaten.

00:56:06.269 --> 00:56:10.269
The joy of Jehovah can help you to keep preaching,

00:56:10.269 --> 00:56:16.269
in spite of indifference, persecution, or any other obstacle.

00:56:16.269 --> 00:56:20.269
Well, maybe you feel that's what I need.

00:56:20.269 --> 00:56:22.269
I need more joy.

00:56:22.269 --> 00:56:26.269
Well, joy is an aspect of the fruitage of the Spirit.

00:56:26.269 --> 00:56:28.269
So when you need more joy, what do you do?

00:56:28.269 --> 00:56:32.269
How do you get more of Jehovah's Spirit?

00:56:32.269 --> 00:56:33.269
You ask for it.

00:56:33.269 --> 00:56:36.269
Father, give me more joy.

00:56:36.269 --> 00:56:39.269
I want to be joyful in my service.

00:56:39.269 --> 00:56:41.269
I want to rejoice in you.

00:56:41.269 --> 00:56:48.510
At the beginning of this talk, we read Psalm 37.4,

00:56:48.510 --> 00:56:53.510
and we focused particularly on the first part of the verse.

00:56:54.510 --> 00:56:59.510
The rejoicing in Jehovah, let's turn to the second part of the verse now.

00:56:59.510 --> 00:57:06.510
Psalm 37.4, and focus on that part for just a moment.

00:57:06.510 --> 00:57:14.019
So Psalm 37.4, the first part says, find exquisite delight in Jehovah.

00:57:14.019 --> 00:57:23.019
And then, and he will grant you the desires of your heart.

00:57:23.019 --> 00:57:27.019
What does your heart desire?

00:57:27.019 --> 00:57:30.019
What are you looking forward to in the New World?

00:57:30.019 --> 00:57:33.019
Is it owning your own home?

00:57:33.019 --> 00:57:37.019
In some countries, maybe just having enough food to eat.

00:57:37.019 --> 00:57:40.019
Are you looking forward to doing work that you really enjoy

00:57:40.019 --> 00:57:44.019
or learning how to do something really well?

00:57:44.019 --> 00:57:51.019
Or maybe you're older now, and you're looking forward to waking up every morning without pain.

00:57:51.019 --> 00:57:54.019
And without wondering, I wonder what this pain means.

00:57:54.019 --> 00:58:02.019
I wonder if I have something serious and never, ever having to think about death again.

00:58:02.019 --> 00:58:08.019
Are you looking forward to conducting a Bible study with an unbelieving relative who returns?

00:58:08.019 --> 00:58:12.019
Or maybe with some historical figure?

00:58:12.019 --> 00:58:15.019
This weekend, we learned that even faithful men of old

00:58:15.019 --> 00:58:18.019
were going to have to adapt to a different way of life

00:58:18.019 --> 00:58:24.019
and learn how to worship Jehovah in a way that will be acceptable to him, then.

00:58:24.019 --> 00:58:27.300
No Abraham.

00:58:27.300 --> 00:58:31.300
That child does not need to be circumcised.

00:58:31.300 --> 00:58:35.929
David, you're not a king anymore.

00:58:35.929 --> 00:58:41.590
If you want a glass of water, you have to get up and get it yourself.

00:58:41.590 --> 00:58:45.590
Samuel, I know you're grateful to be resurrected,

00:58:45.590 --> 00:58:49.590
but we don't offer animal sacrifices anymore.

00:58:49.590 --> 00:58:54.590
So please, put that knife down and leave that bull alone.

00:58:54.590 --> 00:59:00.840
Yes, there are going to be adjustments that have to be made.

00:59:00.840 --> 00:59:02.840
And what about living conditions?

00:59:02.840 --> 00:59:05.840
Where would you prefer to live in the new world?

00:59:05.840 --> 00:59:07.840
Maybe you loved the country.

00:59:07.840 --> 00:59:10.840
And if you're assigned to live in the country, you'll be very happy.

00:59:10.840 --> 00:59:14.840
But suppose you loved the country, but you're assigned to live in a city.

00:59:14.840 --> 00:59:16.840
Well, you can learn to love the city.

00:59:16.840 --> 00:59:22.840
Jehovah can help you to become whatever you need to become.

00:59:22.840 --> 00:59:26.840
Whatever you're given to do in the new world is going to be a blessing.

00:59:26.840 --> 00:59:32.840
Jehovah gives good gifts and perfect presence to his servants.

00:59:32.840 --> 00:59:39.840
And so, Jehovah is going to make arrangements that are going to be for the ultimate good of all mankind.

00:59:39.840 --> 00:59:44.840
Now, we don't know what arrangements will be made to clean up the earth just after the great tribulation,

00:59:44.840 --> 00:59:52.840
but we do know they'll be worked to do, and you may have the privilege of sharing in that.

00:59:52.840 --> 01:00:00.840
And think how you'll feel as you begin to move closer to perfection, both in mind and in body.

01:00:00.840 --> 01:00:06.840
At that time, David's words recorded at Psalm 139.14 are going to take on greater meaning.

01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:09.840
This is the last verse we're going to read during this convention.

01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:17.840
I'd like you to follow along at Psalm 139 and verse 14.

01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:22.840
Now, this is imperfect David writing.

01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:24.840
Psalm 139.14.

01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:32.840
I praise you because in an awe-inspiring way I am wonderfully made.

01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:35.840
Your works are wonderful.

01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:38.840
I know this very well.

01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:45.840
David was impressed by the way his imperfect body functioned.

01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:48.840
Can you imagine how he'll feel when he's perfect?

01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:50.840
You'll probably write another Psalm.

01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:57.440
Well, how do we sum up this heart-staring convention?

01:00:57.440 --> 01:01:06.440
The best way I can think of is for you to enjoy one final video highlighting our reasons for joy now

01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:08.440
and for the future.

01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:16.440
Now, enjoy the video, but pay attention to the music because we're going to be singing that original song at the end of this program.

01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:19.440
We want everyone to sing.

01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:21.440
Everyone must sing.

01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:24.440
No, just moving the lips.

01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:25.440
No faking.

01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:26.440
Sing.

01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:31.389
But enjoy the video as well.

01:01:31.389 --> 01:01:51.099
The stars that fill a summer night look down from above.

01:01:51.099 --> 01:01:58.099
The beauty of the day and night you fashion with love.

01:01:58.099 --> 01:02:05.099
Your hands prepare the land and sea and everything that came to be.

01:02:05.099 --> 01:02:12.289
Projoy to your heart.

01:02:12.289 --> 01:02:15.289
Here is joy in your creation.

01:02:15.289 --> 01:02:25.780
In the message of salvation and the paradise to God.

01:02:25.780 --> 01:02:32.320
But to have your love is a real and lasting treasure.

01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:40.300
You will all will prove to be our toll.

01:02:40.300 --> 01:03:14.889
Delight the things we hear and touch and see and feel deep inside.

01:03:14.889 --> 01:03:18.889
You gave us such a perfect start.

01:03:18.889 --> 01:03:32.219
Eternity in every heart and joy in our nation.

01:03:32.219 --> 01:03:37.219
In the message of salvation and the prayer.

01:03:37.219 --> 01:03:48.840
But to have you is a real and lasting treasure.

01:03:48.840 --> 01:04:36.900
You will all will sacrifice and the prayer.

01:04:36.900 --> 01:04:48.929
Is a real and lasting treasure.

01:04:49.929 --> 01:05:47.380
After that touching video, what more is there to say?

01:05:47.380 --> 01:05:51.380
Find your greatest joy in Jehovah.

01:05:51.380 --> 01:05:56.380
Rejoice, our deliverance, is near.

01:05:56.380 --> 01:05:58.380
Thank you, brothers and sisters.

01:05:58.380 --> 01:06:07.380
Your talk and this entire convention have given us sound scriptural reasons to always rejoice.

01:06:08.380 --> 01:06:14.380
All in attendance will be pleased to know that parts 1 and 2 of the drama,

01:06:14.380 --> 01:06:17.380
Nehemiah, the joy of Jehovah's just stronghold,

01:06:17.380 --> 01:06:25.820
are available now for download on JW.org and in the JW Library app.

01:06:25.820 --> 01:06:29.820
We're certainly grateful to Jehovah God and to Jesus Christ,

01:06:29.820 --> 01:06:35.820
the head of the Christian congregation who have made this convention possible.

01:06:36.820 --> 01:06:42.820
And on behalf of the governing body and all the hardworking members of our Bethel families around the world,

01:06:42.820 --> 01:06:52.820
we wish to extend our gratitude to each of you who have attended this very special edition of the 2020 Regional Convention program.

01:06:52.820 --> 01:06:55.820
We love you very much.

01:06:55.820 --> 01:07:03.820
And we look forward to the time when we can be together again in person and encourage one another face to face.

01:07:04.820 --> 01:07:10.820
From the World Headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses, this is JW Broadcasting.

01:07:10.820 --> 01:07:16.820
Let us conclude now by expressing our joy in our close friendship with Jehovah God.

01:07:16.820 --> 01:07:22.820
Please stand and let's sing together the original song, Our Joy Eternally,

01:07:22.820 --> 01:07:26.820
which we heard sung during the last video the concluding talk.

01:07:26.820 --> 01:07:31.820
After the song, you may have your concluding prayer at your individual locations.

01:07:31.820 --> 01:07:39.820
Now, we invite all to stand and sing out along with the watchtower chorus, Our Joy Eternally.

01:08:17.729 --> 01:08:32.920
Here is joy in your creation, in the message of salvation and the paradise to God.

01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:41.909
But to have is a real and lasting treasure.

01:08:41.909 --> 01:09:24.670
You will all move to the things we hear and touch and see, and feel deep inside.

01:09:25.670 --> 01:09:34.670
You gave us such a perfect start, eternity in every heart and joy in our law.

01:09:34.670 --> 01:09:47.189
In the message of salvation and the prayer.

01:09:47.189 --> 01:09:58.779
But to have is a real and lasting treasure.

01:09:58.779 --> 01:10:46.560
You will all move to salvation and the prayer.

01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:58.819
But to have is a real and lasting treasure.

01:10:58.819 --> 01:11:01.819
You will all move to salvation and the prayer.
