00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:25.949
I suppose whatever we give to Johhover, it's little in comparison to what he gives to us.

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.550
And like Malachi 3-10 says, you know, we just have to bring in the 10th path really as all Johhover's asking.

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.549
But he pours out of blessing.

00:00:33.549 --> 00:00:40.549
Part of those blessings from Malachi 3-10, I consider to be the friendships that we've gained.

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:46.149
For me, my favourite thing is people, it's always, it's just getting to work.

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:51.950
With your brothers every day, the personalities shine through even with language differences.

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.950
You just make friends and you just get this taste of what the new world is going to be like.

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:02.950
Side by side with our brothers and we've made parent figures and brother and sister figures

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:06.950
and everybody just becomes part of such a solid family.

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.549
Going to Hongdae, working along with the local brothers and sisters made it clear to me

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:19.709
that we really are in the organization that Johhover is directing today.

00:01:19.709 --> 00:01:26.310
What I have seen is how Johhover's spirit operates in his organization.

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:33.310
There were many international servants here, from various countries, with different personalities,

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:38.310
along with our local brothers with their distinct customs.

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.709
But when it was time to work, we were as one.

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:48.709
There wasn't a big guy, a little guy, someone more intelligent or less intelligent.

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:51.709
We all formed one united team.

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:56.709
The language definitely was an issue for me.

00:01:56.709 --> 00:02:01.709
At first I thought, will I really be able to work with the brothers?

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:09.710
Since I didn't understand the language, how could I explain the work that had to be done?

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:15.710
Really, if you go in there with a good attitude, you're just having a good time working with your brothers.

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:17.710
You're not going to have too much problems.

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:27.009
Smile, they crossed the borders.

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:32.009
The Chiklao dedication program was held April 9th, 2016,

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:38.009
and the Trujillo Assembly Hall was dedicated shortly thereafter on July 31st.

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:48.740
All present, marveled with appreciation at seeing the facilities.

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.740
Their own new assembly hall.

00:02:51.740 --> 00:03:02.340
Before, we had to work a lot, maybe up to 15 days beforehand to prepare a completely inappropriate site.

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:10.340
Not anymore, now the brothers only need to maintain it and simply arrive in order to enjoy their assembly.

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:17.340
I'm sure that this new assembly hall was strengthened in spirituality of our dear brothers and sisters.

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:26.340
If I could say something about the video monitors, they've revolutionized Jehovah's Method of teaching.

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.340
We get so much more out of the talks now because we can see the gestures of the brothers.

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:36.340
It really touches the heart. It's so amazing.

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.340
I remember more than 25 years ago, I prayed to Jehovah and said,

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:47.340
Jehovah, please, permit me at some point to see an assembly hall here.

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.340
And now, Jehovah let me be part of the buying process,

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:56.340
getting the documentation and to be in the construction.

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:03.259
And I remember and I say, Jehovah answered my prayer.

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:09.259
Well, it affected me seeing the construction progress

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:13.259
because when we first arrived in our project in Chick-Lale,

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:18.259
you know, what the brothers had, what they were using as an assembly hall.

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:22.259
And then to see the finished project that we see now,

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:25.259
I'm so happy for the brothers and sisters.

00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:28.259
It's a beautiful, clean, neat and tidy.

00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:34.259
It's like a, in reality, for where it is, it's a little jewel within that whole city to me.

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:37.259
When I see a completed project,

00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:42.259
and I know that brothers do just love to be able to care for that place,

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:46.259
to be able to go worship Jehovah there, be with their brothers and sisters.

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:52.259
There's nothing that'll ever compare with this wonderful experience we've gotten to have.

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:55.259
It's been great.
