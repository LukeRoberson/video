WEBVTT

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:16.980
Life is a wonderful gift that Jehovah gives us, and Jehovah wants us to use this gift by cherishing our good health.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.980
However, we live in critical and difficult times.

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:27.980
We are not immune from challenges medical otherwise, that everybody in this world faces.

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.980
Therefore, we need to be prepared for a medical situation.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.979
As we make our personal decisions on health-related matters, we must do so well in advance.

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:39.979
Three provisions can help us.

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:50.979
A completed durable power of attorney, DPA or the identity card, medical information documents, and the hospital liaison committee.

00:00:50.979 --> 00:01:03.200
Even though I am young and healthy, I know that accidents can happen in my everyday life.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:11.200
When we prepare the DPA in advance, we are planning to be successful when we face medical situations.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.200
Some time ago, I had a bicycle accident and I broke my collarbone.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:26.200
The HLC confirmed that the hospital I was taken to is cooperative and that my conscience and decisions would be taken into account.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.200
That was very helpful and reassuring in that difficult situation.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:41.920
Medical situations are not always emergencies.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.920
Sometimes we have planned procedures or scheduled therapy like chemotherapy.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.920
There are also joyful occasions like pregnancy and the birth of a baby.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:59.920
The S407 is information for patients requiring surgery or chemotherapy.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:07.920
This document, the S407, allows us to understand which doctors are involved in the therapy for our condition.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:15.919
Based on the information contained in the S407, I was able to find out what questions to ask the doctor before surgery.

00:02:16.919 --> 00:02:24.919
Also, I was able to mentally prepare for the surgery and was assured that my wishes would be honored.

00:02:24.919 --> 00:02:35.919
The information for expectant mothers, the S401, is a particularly useful document especially for new mothers who are experiencing this journey for the first time.

00:02:35.919 --> 00:02:44.919
They can go over it. No exactly what they should do with regard to prenatal visits and then be more confident.

00:02:44.919 --> 00:02:51.919
Where we live, pregnancy is viewed by people as something that we need to keep to ourselves.

00:02:51.919 --> 00:02:57.919
Many are scared that something bad may happen to the pregnancy if they tell others.

00:02:57.919 --> 00:03:03.919
A birth is an extraordinarily happy event. It is a blessing from Jehovah.

00:03:03.919 --> 00:03:09.919
But even in these circumstances, there can be unseen difficulties or complications.

00:03:09.919 --> 00:03:18.919
When I found out that I was pregnant, I was anxious and scared because this was my first time being pregnant.

00:03:18.919 --> 00:03:23.919
And I didn't know what might happen to me or to my child.

00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:31.919
The S401 document let me know that I could contact the HLC and reach out to them for help.

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:34.919
The HLC brothers helped us find a doctor.

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:54.300
The publishers should reach out to the HLC even if it seems that it's not going to be a blood issue.

00:03:54.300 --> 00:04:06.300
Because when the HLC is involved, then we can help the publishers find competent doctors who would respect their decisions and wishes.

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:10.300
There is no reason to hesitate to reach out.

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:15.300
The HLC is very happy to receive calls from brothers who need assistance.

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:21.300
We are prepared to help and Jehovah has trained us to do this job and to do it well.

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:29.300
As members of the Hospital Liaison Committee, we cannot make decisions for our brothers and sisters.

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:39.300
The realm of decision-making for medical care is under the principle at the latest chapter 6.5 that everyone must carry their own load.

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:47.300
Jehovah helps us by providing the HLC as a support so that we can better carry that load.

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.300
The Hospital Liaison Committee brothers are truly reliable.

00:04:51.300 --> 00:05:04.000
These loving brothers do not take our illnesses lightly and they are always careful to maintain confidentiality regarding the situation we are going through.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:13.000
Some brothers have encountered circumstances that have profoundly affected their lives that can be challenging or even burdensome.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:23.000
However, many of them, thanks to the fact that they followed Jehovah's arrangements and took them to heart, reacted wisely to the direction and were prepared.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:30.000
The secret to their success has been that they have taken Jehovah's provisions to heart during such difficult times.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:42.470
They had their completed DPA or their identity card, they had previously carefully read their medical information documents, and they had gone in touch with the HLC.

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:49.470
Being well prepared, they handled their medical situation in a way that made Jehovah's heart rejoice.
