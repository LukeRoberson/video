WEBVTT

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:23.160
have loved for the whole association of brothers.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.199
These words were written down nearly 2,000 years ago,

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:32.899
but we need them now more than ever.

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:38.100
How can we love something as vast as a global brotherhood?

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.700
And in this loveless world,

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.200
how can we make sure that our love never fades?

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:57.229
We were baptized.

00:00:57.229 --> 00:01:00.429
We formally became part of this brotherhood.

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:19.030
Our hearts were full of joy,

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:20.629
but as the years pass,

00:01:20.629 --> 00:01:23.129
it is only too easy to lose sight

00:01:23.129 --> 00:01:29.540
of why we love this brotherhood.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.959
Let's remind ourselves.

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:38.060
Consider three things that our brotherhood is doing.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.260
It is busy in the preaching work.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.780
It comes to the aid of those in need.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:53.420
It gathers together to worship to Hovea God.

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.120
First, you can find our brotherhood

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.019
preaching the good news of God's kingdom,

00:01:59.019 --> 00:02:09.120
wherever you go in the world.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:13.020
Jesse is preparing to go out in the field ministry.

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.819
You got everything?

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:14.620
I think so.

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.419
I'm all packed up and ready to go.

00:02:16.419 --> 00:02:17.620
Well, there's your coffee.

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:18.620
You're going to call me tonight.

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.719
But while the luggage,

00:02:20.719 --> 00:02:22.620
he lives in Alaska,

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.120
a vast region more than twice the size of France.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.120
Many people there live in areas so remote

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.219
that there is only one way to reach them

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:33.719
by airplane.

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:38.219
There are no roads on 50% of that territory.

00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:40.819
It is desolation.

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:42.620
There's not even a trail,

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.020
but there's about 200 villages

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:46.979
with Eskimo, Indian,

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:49.020
Athabaskan, Shimshan,

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.419
clink at tribes,

00:02:50.419 --> 00:02:53.520
probably 70- some thousand people

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.419
scattered in those areas.

00:02:55.419 --> 00:02:57.219
Let me show you here.

00:02:57.219 --> 00:02:58.219
The reason why we're like this is...

00:02:58.219 --> 00:03:01.719
The brothers carefully select the villages to be visited.

00:03:01.719 --> 00:03:03.219
They prepare the airplane

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:05.919
and recruit a crew of pilots and publishers

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:09.120
for a two, three, or four-day trip.

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:19.139
And the pilot, that's what I do for a living.

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:21.639
So there's a certain thrill with flying,

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:22.740
but yet at the same time,

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.439
that part is just a job.

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:26.939
I think what I really enjoy is the ministry.

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:31.539
Being able to reach people out in these remote areas

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:35.919
and bring the truth to them.

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:38.719
You're going over empty spaces.

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:41.319
You don't see a living soul,

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:42.819
and you wonder,

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:44.919
what is this village going to be like?

00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:48.219
So it's a spirit of anticipation.

00:03:48.219 --> 00:03:53.599
What is it going to be like when you land?

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:56.000
The local people are often suspicious

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.599
of men in formal or business attire,

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:00.300
so the brothers make an exception

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:01.800
to our usual standard

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.199
and dress informally for these visits.

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:06.000
First, they have to get to know you.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.800
They want to know,

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.199
why are you there?

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:09.900
Once they understand

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:10.900
that you're there,

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.300
bringing them a message from the Bible,

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:14.699
then they kind of open up.

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:16.500
And we try to show them basic truths

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.100
in the Bible like Psalms 83, 18, or John 17, 3.

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.100
We'll leave our address and phone number that way.

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.100
We encourage them to try to call us

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.699
or try to write us so that we can't study with them.

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:29.899
Of course, this type of witnessing

00:04:29.899 --> 00:04:31.800
has its challenges as well.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.600
Unsanitary conditions,

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.399
swarms of mosquitoes,

00:04:35.399 --> 00:04:37.199
or even worse.

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:38.300
Almost every household

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.100
they're told is watch out for the bears,

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.199
because the bears were there that morning.

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:45.600
And this is really something you have to be careful of.

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:50.000
Such challenges only draw the brothers closer together.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.899
Literally, it was mosquitoes that found them.

00:04:52.899 --> 00:04:54.600
Which one did you get?

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.600
A common bond between the brothers.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.800
It's a very building experience.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.100
Little by little,

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:02.899
we've been getting through it

00:05:02.899 --> 00:05:05.600
so we can say now we've covered all the territory

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:08.899
with the good news at least one time.

00:05:08.899 --> 00:05:11.199
In several places, two times.

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:12.399
And in some places,

00:05:12.399 --> 00:05:14.800
our third visit has taken place.

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.399
This witnessing that we do up here

00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:18.100
and helps me appreciate

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:22.399
that we are fulfilling that Bible prophecy in Matthew 24, 14

00:05:22.399 --> 00:05:23.399
about preaching the good news

00:05:23.399 --> 00:05:25.500
to all the inhabited Earth.

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:26.500
Because that's what we're doing up here.

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:28.199
These are remote areas.

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:40.089
And the society is making sure that they're getting done.

00:05:40.089 --> 00:05:43.089
Our brotherhood has found that in this sophisticated

00:05:43.089 --> 00:05:45.889
European city, as in so many others,

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:48.290
most people are somewhat apathetic

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:50.389
about the Bible's message.

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:52.889
The members of one congregation, however,

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:54.889
are assigned to preach exclusively

00:05:54.889 --> 00:05:59.259
in a very different kind of territory.

00:05:59.259 --> 00:06:02.660
The vast harbor of Antwerp.

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.259
The brothers arrive at the docks

00:06:04.259 --> 00:06:06.560
before the ships are open for boarding.

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:09.259
They use this time to witness to the truck drivers

00:06:09.259 --> 00:06:14.029
who come from many lands to service the harbor.

00:06:14.029 --> 00:06:16.829
And then, it's on to the ships.

00:06:16.829 --> 00:06:18.329
I was very excited.

00:06:18.329 --> 00:06:19.629
I remember that.

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:21.829
But I was also scared because I didn't know

00:06:21.829 --> 00:06:23.129
what was going to happen.

00:06:23.129 --> 00:06:24.629
I didn't know how it worked

00:06:24.629 --> 00:06:26.129
to preaching on the ship.

00:06:26.129 --> 00:06:29.230
The witnesses expect to meet people of all races

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:31.629
and speaking almost any language.

00:06:36.129 --> 00:06:39.230
Sailors from far away or little known countries

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:41.629
are often amazed to see literature

00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:44.629
in their own language.

00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:50.029
On the ships, the witnesses find a very receptive audience.

00:06:50.029 --> 00:06:52.629
They understand that only God could protect them

00:06:52.629 --> 00:06:56.029
against the powers of nature and the sea.

00:06:56.029 --> 00:06:59.629
I never met a seaman who was an atheist, never.

00:06:59.629 --> 00:07:03.430
The Watchtower Society's videos make an effective tool

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:07.230
for witnessing in this territory.

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:11.329
In this way, we've even had up to 15 people at once,

00:07:11.329 --> 00:07:14.529
watched three videos of that choice.

00:07:14.529 --> 00:07:20.879
And afterward, there are many, many questions.

00:07:20.879 --> 00:07:23.180
In this ever-changing territory,

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:29.410
how can the brothers make return visits on interested people?

00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:34.310
The local newspaper tells which ships will be in port each week.

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:36.709
So when the brothers meet an interested sailor,

00:07:36.709 --> 00:07:39.410
they carefully record which ship he works on

00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:41.509
so that they can find him again.

00:07:41.509 --> 00:07:45.110
Before long, they bring their students to congregation meetings.

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:48.910
In just the first three years since the congregation was formed,

00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:54.410
over 1,400 sailors from 41 lands visited the meetings.

00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:58.910
On average, five new Bible studies are started each month.

00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:01.910
One man was really eager to become witness.

00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:03.910
He just read one magazine.

00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:04.910
He said, this is the truth.

00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:06.709
He started talking to the other ones.

00:08:06.709 --> 00:08:09.410
So we came on the ship and his man was preaching.

00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:11.310
He said, I need books, I need books.

00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:13.009
One day, I went to the ship.

00:08:13.009 --> 00:08:16.110
And in the country, the witnesses were banned.

00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:18.410
And we visited the ship three evenings.

00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:21.709
In the last evening, we stayed to 1.30 in the night,

00:08:21.709 --> 00:08:22.910
preaching the good news.

00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:26.110
When we left the ship, the whole crew came on deck.

00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:29.209
And they were all shouting, buy Jehovah's Witness

00:08:29.209 --> 00:08:31.310
till we see you in the paradise.

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:33.309
From the first ship we ever did,

00:08:33.309 --> 00:08:37.009
we really fell in love with these people for the first ship.

00:08:37.009 --> 00:08:37.809
You see?

00:08:37.809 --> 00:08:42.049
So Jesus Christ.

00:08:42.049 --> 00:08:46.620
It is the mightiest river in the world.

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:49.519
But the Amazon River is also a thoroughfare,

00:08:49.519 --> 00:08:52.820
a liquid highway stretching nearly 4,000 miles

00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:57.519
from the highlands of Peru across Brazil to the Atlantic.

00:08:57.519 --> 00:08:59.419
In the dense jungles of Peru,

00:08:59.419 --> 00:09:01.419
the Amazon enables our brotherhood

00:09:01.419 --> 00:09:05.220
to reach people with the good news.

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:08.220
Special pioneers have moved to this region.

00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:11.320
One of the remotest and most rugged in the world

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:17.250
in order to preach to the people.

00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:22.820
The river brings them right into some villages.

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:24.720
Sometimes they are able to witness

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:27.620
without even leaving their boat.

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:32.320
Other villages, though, can only be reached on foot.

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:34.120
They are quite hospitable.

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:36.120
They ask you to come in.

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:38.720
You can gather the whole family and all of them

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:41.320
sit down to listen.

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:44.519
Sometimes the villagers simply gather up their children

00:09:44.519 --> 00:09:48.320
and ask the pioneers to hold a Bible class.

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:51.220
At this village, the chief is a return visit.

00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:53.220
The brothers preach to him in Spanish,

00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:57.220
and he translates the message for the benefit of his people.

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:05.720
The brothers also find a receptive audience

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:08.220
at a local leper colony.

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:12.220
Here in the Amazon,

00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:17.120
sometimes you meet natives who have not heard about God.

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:23.120
To reach them with their truth is a beautiful experience.

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:29.120
The pioneers readily admit that this territory has its hardships.

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:31.519
When we go preaching into the forest,

00:10:31.519 --> 00:10:35.120
maybe the snakes.

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:36.419
The heat,

00:10:36.419 --> 00:10:39.419
heat that sometimes lasts into the night.

00:10:39.419 --> 00:10:42.120
No electric light, no water.

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:46.620
Well, it would be loneliness to fight against the loneliness

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:49.620
since I am far from my family.

00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:52.620
But where others might see only problems,

00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:56.620
these pioneers see solutions.

00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:59.620
Conduct Bible studies with the people.

00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:03.620
I try to make them my family and see them as my future brothers.

00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:05.620
I always stay very close to them

00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:11.450
so that the loneliness that I feel is not so bad.

00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:13.450
The ladies become my friends.

00:11:13.450 --> 00:11:17.450
They can tell me their problems, and I try to help them.

00:11:19.450 --> 00:11:21.450
When you see the people coming to the Kingdom Hall,

00:11:21.450 --> 00:11:23.450
they forget the heat and the difficulties.

00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:27.450
Obviously, Jehovah blesses the work that we are doing.

00:11:28.450 --> 00:11:33.450
Thanks to Jehovah, at least for now I am conducting 25 Bible studies.

00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:37.450
And I would say that 50% come to the Kingdom Hall.

00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:42.450
There are only three of Jehovah's Witnesses in the region and us.

00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:45.450
The two special pioneers.

00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:48.450
But 89 people attended the memorial.

00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:55.450
It really is a great privilege for me to be working for the Kingdom here in this part of Peru.

00:11:55.450 --> 00:11:59.450
To know that many more brothers are also doing it in different parts of the earth,

00:11:59.450 --> 00:12:02.450
that really encourages us.

00:12:02.450 --> 00:12:09.059
We are not alone.

00:12:09.059 --> 00:12:11.059
They are far from alone.

00:12:11.059 --> 00:12:19.639
All over the world, the brotherhood is busy in the same work.

00:12:20.639 --> 00:12:24.639
Witnesses who live in the cities and larger villages of Mozambique

00:12:24.639 --> 00:12:27.639
regularly travel to remote rural areas.

00:12:27.639 --> 00:12:37.269
They carefully plan their visits according to the seasons.

00:12:37.269 --> 00:12:41.269
This enables them to reach hardworking farmers and their families.

00:12:41.269 --> 00:13:08.220
Hood is working shoulder to shoulder, preaching to people,

00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:10.220
wherever they may be found.

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:21.029
Are you taking part in the preaching work where you live?

00:13:21.029 --> 00:13:24.029
You may feel that what you do is rather ordinary.

00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:33.580
But when you preach, however and wherever you do it,

00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:37.580
you are taking part in the same wonderful work.

00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:42.580
You're doing a work that draws you closer to your brothers and sisters.

00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:46.580
A work that reaches people and saves lives.

00:13:46.580 --> 00:14:10.580
A work that pleases Jehovah God.

00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:13.580
Passers-by barely notice this spot.

00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:17.580
Just an empty lot in a bustling Japanese city.

00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:23.580
To one of our brothers, though, this place is full of meaning.

00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:27.580
I lived here for 27 years.

00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:35.580
My wife and two daughters and I had a happy life here.

00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:43.580
On January 17, 1995, Takau Jinguji, like so many others in Kobe, Japan,

00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:47.580
saw his whole world turn upside down.

00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:54.580
When the earthquake hit, there was a tremor, a big tremor.

00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:57.580
But I had no idea what was happening.

00:14:57.580 --> 00:15:03.580
In the next moment, I turned over and reached for my wife's hand.

00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:06.580
And she reached for mine.

00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:08.580
And we touched.

00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:17.110
But then, after the next quake, our hands were separated.

00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:22.110
Of the 5,500 killed in the quake, 13 were Jehovah's Witnesses

00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:25.110
and two were unbaptized associates.

00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:28.110
The quake left over 300,000 homeless.

00:15:28.110 --> 00:15:34.110
350 homes of Jehovah's Witnesses were destroyed or severely damaged.

00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:37.110
Kotoya, the oldest of three children,

00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:42.110
waited in mounting fear as the rubble of her home was cleared away.

00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:45.110
Her parents were missing.

00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:50.110
Then we saw a man's hand,

00:15:50.110 --> 00:15:56.110
and the two of them were under there.

00:15:56.110 --> 00:15:58.110
Kunio, Tsunasawa and Elder,

00:15:58.110 --> 00:16:03.110
was at the children's side when the parents were found.

00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:08.110
The doctor tried mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to get them breathing,

00:16:08.110 --> 00:16:14.110
but he couldn't, both the mother and father had died.

00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:18.110
Takau Jinguji crawled from this rubble,

00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:20.110
battered and bruised,

00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:24.110
desperate to find his wife and daughter.

00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:31.110
The place where my wife and daughter were trapped just became a sea of fire.

00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:34.110
They tried putting out the fire,

00:16:34.110 --> 00:16:38.110
but there was no water, not even a fire extinguisher.

00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:44.110
There was nothing we could do but stand and watch.

00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:53.110
Honestly speaking, knowing that they did die instantly helps me to cope.

00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:56.110
I was able to remain very calm.

00:16:56.110 --> 00:17:00.110
At that time, I really felt Jehovah's help.

00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:03.110
Even in the worst of moments,

00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:09.109
the brothers and sisters were there to support one another.

00:17:09.109 --> 00:17:12.109
From the time they dug my father and mother out,

00:17:12.109 --> 00:17:18.109
brother and sister Tsunasawa were right there by my side.

00:17:18.109 --> 00:17:23.109
The two of them stayed with us and went to the morgue with us.

00:17:23.109 --> 00:17:26.109
She held my hand.

00:17:26.109 --> 00:17:28.109
She didn't say a word,

00:17:28.109 --> 00:17:33.109
but her feelings got through to me.

00:17:33.109 --> 00:17:36.109
In the face of all this devastation,

00:17:36.109 --> 00:17:41.109
the brotherhood launched the relief work immediately.

00:17:41.109 --> 00:17:45.109
The circus giving aid selected a few kingdom halls

00:17:45.109 --> 00:17:49.109
and gave instructions together relief supplies,

00:17:49.109 --> 00:17:56.109
water and basic good stuff to these locations immediately.

00:17:56.109 --> 00:18:02.809
Takaujin Guruji had just lost his wife and daughter.

00:18:02.809 --> 00:18:06.809
Still, he joined the relief work.

00:18:06.809 --> 00:18:10.809
I was able to take part fully in that activity

00:18:10.809 --> 00:18:15.809
and I surely felt Jehovah's strength.

00:18:15.809 --> 00:18:20.809
Within days, brothers from the branch near Tokyo were at the disaster site.

00:18:20.809 --> 00:18:24.809
Quake victims were deeply moved.

00:18:24.809 --> 00:18:28.809
The relief work soon progressed from providing food and water

00:18:28.809 --> 00:18:33.809
to protecting damaged homes from the elements.

00:18:33.809 --> 00:18:38.809
The neighbors watched all the brothers working

00:18:38.809 --> 00:18:43.809
and said things like, where did they come from?

00:18:43.809 --> 00:18:46.809
Is it Jehovah's legend?

00:18:46.809 --> 00:18:49.809
Spiritual needs were among the first address,

00:18:49.809 --> 00:18:51.809
shepherding calls, Christian meetings,

00:18:51.809 --> 00:18:55.809
and the preaching were continued uninterrupted.

00:18:55.809 --> 00:19:04.809
Because we know there is a resurrection

00:19:04.809 --> 00:19:14.809
declaring that hope to others can heal the hearts of those who lost loved ones.

00:19:14.809 --> 00:19:16.809
In one relief program,

00:19:16.809 --> 00:19:19.809
Quake victims were taken by bus to an assembly hall facility

00:19:19.809 --> 00:19:22.809
where they were given a clean room to spend the night,

00:19:22.809 --> 00:19:26.809
a hot bath, and all the supplies they needed.

00:19:26.809 --> 00:19:29.809
They also attended a meeting and went in field service

00:19:29.809 --> 00:19:33.809
in an undamaged territory.

00:19:33.809 --> 00:19:38.809
Then they would take us back home right to our house.

00:19:38.809 --> 00:19:43.809
I thought it was a very kind arrangement.

00:19:43.809 --> 00:19:47.809
The Nagais, a disabled pioneer couple in Kobe,

00:19:47.809 --> 00:19:53.089
opened their tiny apartment for use as a kingdom hall.

00:19:53.089 --> 00:20:00.089
They had a peak of 72 people at the meeting here.

00:20:00.089 --> 00:20:06.089
The brothers who used the place this way were really thankful

00:20:06.089 --> 00:20:11.089
because they didn't have anywhere to meet.

00:20:11.089 --> 00:20:14.089
The brothers endeavored to help all whom they could,

00:20:14.089 --> 00:20:17.089
including non-witnesses.

00:20:17.089 --> 00:20:22.089
We went to the largest hospital in Kobe

00:20:22.089 --> 00:20:31.089
and we shared with them our futons, blankets, rice, and many things.

00:20:31.089 --> 00:20:36.089
The earthquake continued to take its toll for years afterward.

00:20:36.089 --> 00:20:39.089
It's been three years since it happened,

00:20:39.089 --> 00:20:43.089
but no aday goes by that I don't think about the earthquake.

00:20:43.089 --> 00:20:47.089
However, Quake survivors have drawn great comfort

00:20:47.089 --> 00:20:51.089
from staying close to Jehovah and the worldwide brotherhood.

00:20:52.089 --> 00:20:59.089
Of course, there were times when I myself got weak

00:20:59.089 --> 00:21:03.089
because of the pain and loneliness.

00:21:03.089 --> 00:21:07.089
But at those times, I got a lot of comfort

00:21:07.089 --> 00:21:11.089
from attending the meetings or doing personal Bible reading

00:21:11.089 --> 00:21:16.089
or reading the magazines.

00:21:17.089 --> 00:21:22.089
Those who were concerned about us

00:21:22.089 --> 00:21:26.089
sent letters and small memos.

00:21:26.089 --> 00:21:31.089
They really encouraged us.

00:21:31.089 --> 00:21:35.089
The brothers and sisters left their work

00:21:35.089 --> 00:21:41.089
and they used that time to help us even risking their secure work.

00:21:41.089 --> 00:21:44.089
So I felt that love.

00:21:44.089 --> 00:21:47.089
Kotoyo had lost her parents.

00:21:47.089 --> 00:21:49.089
But she was soon part of a new family.

00:21:49.089 --> 00:21:51.089
Some months after the earthquake,

00:21:51.089 --> 00:21:54.089
brother and sister Tsunasawa invited her

00:21:54.089 --> 00:21:57.089
and her siblings to come live with them.

00:21:57.089 --> 00:22:03.089
They gave us the strength to go on.

00:22:03.089 --> 00:22:07.089
The congregation members and brothers and sisters

00:22:07.089 --> 00:22:13.089
from other congregations were a great comfort to me.

00:22:13.089 --> 00:22:21.089
They said, just seeing your face at the meetings encourages us.

00:22:21.089 --> 00:22:27.089
That really comforted me.

00:22:27.089 --> 00:22:30.089
The earthquake had devastated a city

00:22:30.089 --> 00:22:35.089
but the brotherhood emerged stronger than ever.

00:22:35.089 --> 00:22:39.089
I strongly feel that the brothers and sisters

00:22:39.089 --> 00:22:43.089
have been doing just as Jesus says.

00:22:43.089 --> 00:22:49.089
They love the brothers and sisters in the same way he does.

00:22:49.089 --> 00:22:54.089
I'm just so glad to be part of this organization.

00:22:54.089 --> 00:23:03.400
The decade of the 1990s saw many disasters.

00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:09.400
In August 1992, Hurricane Andrew caused tremendous damage.

00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:13.400
Our brotherhood was praised for its relief efforts.

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:16.400
A local newspaper commented,

00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:20.400
no one is slamming doors on the Jehovah's Witnesses this week,

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:23.400
even if they have doors to slam.

00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:27.400
About 3,000 witness volunteers from across the country

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:31.400
have converged on the disaster area.

00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:34.400
First to help their own, then to help others.

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:37.400
The paper added, any military organization

00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:42.400
might envy the witness's precision, discipline and efficiency.

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:54.019
First disasters of the 1990s were manly.

00:23:54.019 --> 00:23:58.019
In 1994, ethnic hatred and civil war

00:23:58.019 --> 00:24:01.019
ripped apart the countries of Rwanda and Burundi.

00:24:01.019 --> 00:24:04.019
Hundreds of thousands were killed.

00:24:04.019 --> 00:24:08.019
Refugees numbered well over a million.

00:24:08.019 --> 00:24:14.019
Similar troubles have plagued Liberia, Sierra Leone and Congo.

00:24:14.019 --> 00:24:17.019
Among Jehovah's Witnesses, such disasters

00:24:17.019 --> 00:24:20.019
have meant death for hundreds.

00:24:20.019 --> 00:24:26.880
Poverty, disease, homelessness and hunger for thousands more.

00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:30.880
The Brotherhood works hard to come to their aid.

00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:33.880
During one relief effort in July 1994,

00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:36.880
witnesses in France, Switzerland and Belgium

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:41.880
contributed over $1,600,000 to a fund for their brothers

00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:43.880
in Rwanda and Burundi.

00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:45.880
Notified of the need on a Friday,

00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:49.880
the Brothers in Europe shipped 35 tons of relief provisions

00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:54.890
by the following Wednesday.

00:24:54.890 --> 00:24:58.890
More recently, witnesses in Europe gathered more than 400

00:24:58.890 --> 00:25:01.890
tons of relief supplies to ship to their brothers

00:25:01.890 --> 00:25:03.890
in Kinshasa, Congo.

00:25:03.890 --> 00:25:06.890
This kind of help keeps people alive.

00:25:06.890 --> 00:25:08.890
But it does more.

00:25:08.890 --> 00:25:11.890
It reminds all concerned that all Brotherhood

00:25:11.890 --> 00:25:14.890
is not merely a thing of words.

00:25:14.890 --> 00:25:16.890
It is real.

00:25:16.890 --> 00:25:29.339
Now, you may never have had the opportunity to take part

00:25:29.339 --> 00:25:33.339
in relief efforts for such extreme cases of distress.

00:25:33.339 --> 00:25:36.339
Does that mean that you are no part of this work?

00:25:36.339 --> 00:25:38.339
Not at all.

00:25:38.339 --> 00:25:42.339
In this troubled world, distress takes many forms.

00:25:42.339 --> 00:25:46.869
When you visit the sick,

00:25:46.869 --> 00:25:50.869
when you help out the elderly and infirm,

00:25:50.869 --> 00:25:55.869
when you take time to comfort a depressed soul,

00:25:56.869 --> 00:25:59.869
when you take an interest in your brothers and sisters

00:25:59.869 --> 00:26:01.869
in the faith,

00:26:01.869 --> 00:26:05.869
you add your own part to the great identifying mark

00:26:05.869 --> 00:26:07.869
of this Brotherhood.

00:26:07.869 --> 00:26:22.960
Love.

00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:24.960
Nothing is more important to our Brotherhood

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:27.960
than worshipping Jehovah God.

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:30.960
Our places of worship are modest.

00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:33.960
Still, they are important.

00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:36.960
As the Brotherhood continues to expand,

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:39.960
more and more kingdom halls are needed.

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:42.960
Recently, that was a problem in Machachi,

00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:46.960
a city nestled in the mountains of Ecuador.

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:49.960
Three or four brothers with construction experience

00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:53.960
guide the brothers doing the work.

00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:56.960
With the help of the brothers,

00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:58.960
we can work in less time,

00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:02.960
and all the labor is free of charge.

00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:05.960
When all the preparations are complete,

00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:29.700
the period of intense activity begins.

00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:31.700
Many brothers who work secularly

00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:34.700
made arrangements beforehand to take days off

00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:39.700
so that they could come and support the work.

00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:54.740
This is a joyful experience

00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:56.740
for brothers to come from afar

00:27:56.740 --> 00:27:59.740
to help build Jehovah's house of worship.

00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:13.460
It brought us closer to one another and to Jehovah.

00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:31.779
On these projects,

00:28:31.779 --> 00:28:35.779
there is plenty of work for all the volunteers.

00:28:35.779 --> 00:28:40.779
We have seen a beautiful, joyful attitude.

00:28:40.779 --> 00:28:42.779
Everyone collaborates,

00:28:42.779 --> 00:28:46.779
all are willing from the youngest to the oldest.

00:28:46.779 --> 00:28:49.779
Everyone involved wants the new kingdom hall

00:28:49.779 --> 00:28:52.779
to serve as a good witness to the community.

00:28:52.779 --> 00:28:57.299
During the construction,

00:28:57.299 --> 00:29:01.299
we have heard positive comments from people.

00:29:02.299 --> 00:29:07.299
Many are amazed that the unity among Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:29:07.299 --> 00:29:09.299
For example,

00:29:09.299 --> 00:29:11.299
people see that we are industrious,

00:29:11.299 --> 00:29:14.299
that we are like ants.

00:29:14.299 --> 00:29:17.299
They would like to see other people in the community

00:29:17.299 --> 00:29:21.299
working together like this to get things done.

00:29:21.299 --> 00:29:24.299
At last, the job is complete,

00:29:24.299 --> 00:29:28.299
and the time has come to dedicate the new kingdom hall.

00:29:29.299 --> 00:29:31.299
And so brothers,

00:29:31.299 --> 00:29:34.299
this kingdom hall has dedicated to Jehovah.

00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:15.259
By outlying such meetings.

00:30:15.259 --> 00:30:17.259
Estonia, in Eastern Europe,

00:30:17.259 --> 00:30:20.259
offers its citizens religious freedom.

00:30:20.259 --> 00:30:23.259
Our brothers and sisters are now free to meet together for worship.

00:30:23.259 --> 00:30:25.259
But decades ago,

00:30:25.259 --> 00:30:27.259
throughout Eastern Europe and Russia,

00:30:27.259 --> 00:30:30.259
things were far different.

00:30:30.259 --> 00:30:34.259
These men from the secret police, the KGB said,

00:30:34.259 --> 00:30:35.259
where is Jehovah?

00:30:35.259 --> 00:30:38.259
We are going to make sure that the name Jehovah

00:30:38.259 --> 00:30:41.259
will never even be remembered in Estonia.

00:30:41.259 --> 00:30:43.259
You are going to a camp,

00:30:43.259 --> 00:30:44.259
others to Siberia.

00:30:44.259 --> 00:30:46.259
Where is your Jehovah?

00:30:48.259 --> 00:30:51.259
I was deported to Siberia.

00:30:51.259 --> 00:30:53.259
I was eight years old at the time,

00:30:53.259 --> 00:30:55.259
and that was in 1951.

00:30:55.259 --> 00:30:57.259
We were there seven years,

00:30:57.259 --> 00:31:02.259
but later I was imprisoned from 63 to 66.

00:31:02.259 --> 00:31:06.259
In 1951, over 300 were deported.

00:31:06.259 --> 00:31:08.259
My father and mother included,

00:31:08.259 --> 00:31:12.259
so that Jehovah's name would no longer be remembered in Estonia,

00:31:12.259 --> 00:31:13.259
period.

00:31:13.259 --> 00:31:15.259
And so we began a new life.

00:31:15.259 --> 00:31:17.259
We were out in the vast Russian steps,

00:31:17.259 --> 00:31:20.259
and we just preached.

00:31:20.259 --> 00:31:22.259
Did this severe persecution

00:31:22.259 --> 00:31:24.259
put a stop to Christian meetings?

00:31:24.259 --> 00:31:25.259
There were meetings,

00:31:25.259 --> 00:31:27.259
but they were not these large ones.

00:31:27.259 --> 00:31:30.259
It was in small groups that we got together and discussed things.

00:31:30.259 --> 00:31:34.259
Also, the place and time of the next meeting were decided.

00:31:34.259 --> 00:31:37.259
And you couldn't even say it out loud.

00:31:38.259 --> 00:31:40.259
We traveled several hours together.

00:31:40.259 --> 00:31:42.259
Before seven in the morning,

00:31:42.259 --> 00:31:43.259
we took the children.

00:31:43.259 --> 00:31:45.259
They were young.

00:31:45.259 --> 00:31:46.259
Sometimes to take them,

00:31:46.259 --> 00:31:49.259
we even put them in a shopping bag.

00:31:49.259 --> 00:31:51.259
They traveled by bus,

00:31:51.259 --> 00:31:54.259
then walked for miles.

00:31:54.259 --> 00:31:55.259
Every week,

00:31:55.259 --> 00:31:57.259
it took us about 12 hours

00:31:57.259 --> 00:31:59.259
to attend the watchtower study.

00:31:59.259 --> 00:32:02.259
By the time we got back,

00:32:02.259 --> 00:32:06.259
what did the brothers do about literature to study at their meetings?

00:32:06.259 --> 00:32:08.259
In the beginning,

00:32:08.259 --> 00:32:11.259
we could not reproduce the watchtower,

00:32:11.259 --> 00:32:15.259
except by either using a typewriter

00:32:15.259 --> 00:32:18.259
or copying by hand.

00:32:18.259 --> 00:32:23.259
But a typewriter was a dangerous thing to own in those days.

00:32:23.259 --> 00:32:27.259
It couldn't be hidden just anywhere.

00:32:27.259 --> 00:32:30.259
It would be found with a metal detector.

00:32:30.259 --> 00:32:32.259
It wouldn't house around the ground.

00:32:32.259 --> 00:32:34.259
It would easily be found.

00:32:34.259 --> 00:32:37.259
But my home has a metal roof.

00:32:37.259 --> 00:32:40.259
Near the chimney, under the metal roof,

00:32:40.259 --> 00:32:43.259
I had a hiding place.

00:32:43.259 --> 00:32:51.890
The brothers reproduced literature

00:32:51.890 --> 00:32:53.890
using their own stencils

00:32:53.890 --> 00:32:56.890
and hid it all very carefully.

00:32:56.890 --> 00:33:00.890
And that was how we survived spiritually all those years,

00:33:00.890 --> 00:33:04.890
despite the hardships and persecution.

00:33:04.890 --> 00:33:13.299
Change swept across Eastern Europe

00:33:13.299 --> 00:33:17.299
in the late 1980s and early 1990s.

00:33:17.299 --> 00:33:23.299
In Estonia, the work was legalized in 1991.

00:33:23.299 --> 00:33:27.299
Especially for those who for decades were here on the dose

00:33:27.299 --> 00:33:30.299
closed conditions as Jehovah's Witnesses

00:33:30.299 --> 00:33:33.299
for them to experience this freedom

00:33:33.299 --> 00:33:40.299
was of course a very moving experience.

00:33:41.299 --> 00:33:43.299
Free to preach openly at last,

00:33:43.299 --> 00:33:44.299
the brotherhood in Estonia

00:33:44.299 --> 00:33:47.299
and across Eastern Europe and Russia

00:33:47.299 --> 00:33:49.299
makes every effort to invite the public

00:33:49.299 --> 00:33:51.299
to attend the Christian meetings.

00:33:51.299 --> 00:33:54.299
This is especially true at the time of the memorial,

00:33:54.299 --> 00:33:57.299
the most important meeting of the year.

00:33:57.299 --> 00:33:59.299
One brother recalls the last time

00:33:59.299 --> 00:34:01.299
the memorial was held under the ban.

00:34:01.299 --> 00:34:04.299
It was in his own small home.

00:34:04.299 --> 00:34:07.299
There were exactly 60 people here.

00:34:07.299 --> 00:34:09.300
Can you imagine?

00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:12.300
60 people sat here in these rooms.

00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:14.300
And for us, that was a lot.

00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:17.300
But now well, now there are several congregations

00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:20.300
and in each one several hundred are present.

00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:41.440
The meetings started full speed

00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:45.440
and the joy of the brothers was so great.

00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:48.440
And what kept ringing in my ears were the words,

00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:53.440
the name Jehovah will never even be remembered in Estonia.

00:34:53.440 --> 00:35:07.460
Lundazi in Zambia is an unusual village.

00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:10.460
Most of the time it stands empty.

00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:12.460
But for a few weeks each year,

00:35:12.460 --> 00:35:14.460
the place comes alive.

00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:16.460
Hundreds of our brothers and sisters

00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:18.460
travel there for their conventions.

00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:22.460
Many have walked for three days.

00:35:22.460 --> 00:35:26.460
We do not stop along the way, except to eat.

00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:29.460
And when it is dark, we stop.

00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:31.460
We sleep only for a few hours.

00:35:31.460 --> 00:35:33.460
And when it is still dark, we wake up

00:35:33.460 --> 00:35:37.460
and start traveling again until morning.

00:35:37.460 --> 00:35:41.460
We feel very tired because of the heavy luggage that we carry.

00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:44.460
But when we arrive and see all these brothers,

00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:47.460
we rejoice very much.

00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:52.460
Many arrive early to restore and repair the village.

00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:55.460
Others gather wood for the countless cookfires

00:35:55.460 --> 00:35:57.460
that will be needed.

00:35:57.460 --> 00:36:02.460
Before long, the village is humming with life.

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.000
The most important work, though,

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:25.000
is preparing for the convention itself.

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:30.409
At last, the program begins.

00:36:30.409 --> 00:36:32.409
I cannot tell you my brother.

00:36:32.409 --> 00:36:34.409
The trip that we derived from it.

00:36:34.409 --> 00:36:36.409
That is the cause for great rejoicing.

00:36:36.409 --> 00:36:38.409
Much rejoicing.

00:36:38.409 --> 00:36:41.409
After the convention comes the long journey home.

00:36:41.409 --> 00:36:45.409
But these brothers and sisters are accustomed to long walks.

00:36:45.409 --> 00:36:48.409
It is not strange for us to walk

00:36:48.409 --> 00:36:51.409
because we were born in Africa.

00:36:51.409 --> 00:36:54.409
A country where many are poor.

00:36:54.409 --> 00:36:57.409
It is our way of life.

00:36:58.409 --> 00:37:01.409
We should press forward and not shrink back.

00:37:01.409 --> 00:37:03.409
Mountains do not matter.

00:37:03.409 --> 00:37:05.409
Walking day and night does not matter.

00:37:05.409 --> 00:37:08.409
But what we want is that life we are looking forward

00:37:08.409 --> 00:37:10.409
to attaining in the future.

00:37:10.409 --> 00:37:15.739
For another group of witnesses,

00:37:15.739 --> 00:37:19.739
walking to their district convention is not an option.

00:37:19.739 --> 00:37:24.739
They live on an island in Lake Chilwa, Malawi.

00:37:24.739 --> 00:37:27.739
We were on the ban for about 27 years.

00:37:28.739 --> 00:37:30.739
We didn't know a million is only at night.

00:37:30.739 --> 00:37:32.739
But for some reason, this has changed.

00:37:32.739 --> 00:37:35.739
And we are now able to watch it every day.

00:37:35.739 --> 00:37:40.500
On Lake Chilwa, as in most of rural Africa,

00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:43.500
the business of surviving day-to-day consumes

00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:46.500
a great deal of time and energy.

00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:51.500
Our daily lives are somewhat difficult.

00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:55.500
The fields are barren, insufficient.

00:37:56.500 --> 00:38:01.500
The money to buy first-year equipment is very hard to find.

00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:05.500
In spite of difficulties,

00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:09.500
these brothers find great encouragement in their meetings.

00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:15.500
Getting to the district convention requires an expedition of sorts.

00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:20.500
There are some difficulties because it is a great distance

00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:23.500
from here to the convention site.

00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:28.500
The major problem is that we have to cross the lake.

00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:31.500
When we reach the other side,

00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:33.500
some use a car,

00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:35.500
some use bicycles,

00:38:36.500 --> 00:38:38.500
others bought buses,

00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:43.500
then we have others who go on foot because they are disadvantaged.

00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:50.500
For some, this convention will be a personal landmark,

00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:53.500
this small congregation of 62 publishers

00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:55.500
has seven candidates for baptism

00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:57.500
from one side of the island,

00:38:57.500 --> 00:38:59.500
and three from the other side.

00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:04.500
Even some of those who have qualified for baptism still ask,

00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:07.500
are we truly going to be baptized this very week?

00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:09.500
They are very excited.

00:39:35.349 --> 00:39:38.349
At last, they are at the convention.

00:39:38.349 --> 00:39:41.349
Their intense desire to be fed spiritually

00:39:41.349 --> 00:39:43.349
has brought them all this way.

00:39:44.349 --> 00:39:47.349
What makes me feel very happy at the meetings is one,

00:39:47.349 --> 00:39:49.349
seeing the feces of the brothers,

00:39:49.349 --> 00:39:52.349
two, hearing expressions that the brothers make,

00:39:52.349 --> 00:39:55.349
and three, singing songs of praise.

00:39:55.349 --> 00:39:57.349
Actually, that associating with the brothers

00:39:57.349 --> 00:40:01.860
is one of the most important things in my life.

00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:04.860
All are delighted as the baptismal candidates stand

00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:07.860
and voice their resolve to serve Jehovah.

00:40:07.860 --> 00:40:11.860
These disciples are about to take the most important step of their lives.

00:40:12.860 --> 00:40:15.860
This day, they publicly embrace Jehovah

00:40:15.860 --> 00:40:17.860
as their rightful sovereign.

00:40:17.860 --> 00:40:20.860
They also become part of our brotherhood.

00:40:20.860 --> 00:41:08.780
After their baptism,

00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:12.780
our ten new brothers and sisters are ready for their journey home.

00:41:13.780 --> 00:41:17.780
But their journey as Christians is just beginning.

00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:26.920
When you journey to your own Christian meetings,

00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:32.219
you may not meet the same challenges.

00:41:33.219 --> 00:41:36.219
But you have your own challenges to face.

00:41:36.219 --> 00:41:38.219
We all do.

00:41:41.139 --> 00:41:43.139
Despite all obstacles,

00:41:43.139 --> 00:41:47.139
we are there at our meetings, week after week.

00:41:47.139 --> 00:41:49.139
Why?

00:41:49.139 --> 00:41:51.139
The reason is simple.

00:41:51.139 --> 00:41:53.139
For the same reason,

00:41:53.139 --> 00:41:56.139
our brothers and sisters are deeply touched

00:41:56.139 --> 00:42:00.139
when they get to attend meetings again after years under ban.

00:42:00.139 --> 00:42:02.139
Personally, for me,

00:42:02.139 --> 00:42:06.139
meeting an each convention was such a big emotional experience.

00:42:06.139 --> 00:42:08.139
I can only say,

00:42:08.139 --> 00:42:10.139
Jehovah, Jehovah,

00:42:10.139 --> 00:42:15.139
a prayer of thanks as the tears fall.

00:42:15.139 --> 00:42:17.139
For the same reason,

00:42:17.139 --> 00:42:21.139
we are moved to help our brothers and sisters in need.

00:42:21.139 --> 00:42:25.139
I would like to take this opportunity to tell the brothers and sisters

00:42:25.139 --> 00:42:28.139
around the world how thankful I am

00:42:28.139 --> 00:42:31.139
for all the help you've gave us.

00:42:31.139 --> 00:42:34.139
That one thought says it all.

00:42:34.139 --> 00:42:37.139
Of course, I am very thankful to Jehovah,

00:42:37.139 --> 00:42:41.139
the one who led me to this organization.

00:42:41.139 --> 00:42:44.139
For the same reason,

00:42:44.139 --> 00:42:49.139
we preach faithfully whenever and however we can.

00:42:49.139 --> 00:42:53.139
When you have the opportunity to give these people a message

00:42:53.139 --> 00:42:56.139
that some of them have never had before,

00:42:56.139 --> 00:42:58.139
even though they've had a Bible,

00:42:58.139 --> 00:43:02.139
that is the peak of privilege and a wonderful honor.

00:43:02.139 --> 00:43:04.139
For the same reason,

00:43:04.139 --> 00:43:07.139
we dedicated our lives to Jehovah.

00:43:07.139 --> 00:43:11.139
It may be years since we became part of this brotherhood,

00:43:11.139 --> 00:43:15.139
but our reason for doing so has only grown stronger.

00:43:15.139 --> 00:43:18.139
It is the simplest thing.

00:43:18.139 --> 00:43:20.139
We love Jehovah,

00:43:20.139 --> 00:43:22.139
so we love to learn about him

00:43:22.139 --> 00:43:25.139
and to teach others about him.

00:43:25.139 --> 00:43:29.139
And we love the people Jehovah loves.

00:43:29.139 --> 00:43:32.139
When we help them out in times of need,

00:43:32.139 --> 00:43:35.139
we do not expect God to thank us.

00:43:35.139 --> 00:43:38.139
We thank God.

00:43:38.139 --> 00:43:44.139
This brotherhood he has given us is a gift that touches our hearts.

00:43:44.139 --> 00:43:49.139
Every passing day gives us more reasons to have love

00:43:49.139 --> 00:43:54.139
for our whole association of brothers.
