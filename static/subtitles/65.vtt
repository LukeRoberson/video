00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:09.099
Welcome to JW Broadcasting. This month we focus on how we can refine ourselves as

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:15.900
Christians by imitating Jehovah's Holiness. Do you sometimes say things you later

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:22.339
regret? Something unkind perhaps critical of others? We'll learn from this

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:29.899
dramatization how to adjust not only what we say but also how we think. If you're a

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:37.460
young person, do you ever feel you're in a fight? A fight to please Jehovah? A fight

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:45.619
to be joyful despite opposition? You'll enjoy our new music video. Some of Jehovah's

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:51.500
people have suffered disappointing spiritual setbacks. Jehovah lovingly wants

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:57.859
people to return to him. We'll see how he helped this man turn his life around.

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:25.659
All of this and more on JW Broadcasting for October 2019. When I say the words

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:32.379
holy and holiness, what comes to your mind? Many think of words like clean and

00:01:32.379 --> 00:01:39.780
pure. But let's change the question a little. Who comes to your mind? Likely you

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:46.019
think of Jehovah. You might also picture Jesus Christ and the Holy Angels. But do

00:01:46.019 --> 00:01:54.019
you think of imperfect humans? Can humans be described as holy? Yes. We know

00:01:54.019 --> 00:01:59.420
this because humans were created in God's image. Just as we can reflect godly

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:06.739
qualities such as love, kindness and self-control, we can reflect holiness. How

00:02:06.739 --> 00:02:14.180
seriously should we take holiness? It's no small matter. Today the world around us

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:20.979
is increasing in badness. 2 Timothy chapter 3 verse 13 warns that wicked men would advance

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:27.460
from bad to worse. Undoubtedly, before the end, Satan's efforts to promote wickedness

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:36.099
will intensify. So we must intensify our efforts to be holy and reject all badness.

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:45.419
Who do you think are Satan's primary targets? We are. He and the demons are like a

00:02:45.419 --> 00:02:52.139
pack of hungry lions looking to devour us. Being a publisher of the good news is

00:02:52.139 --> 00:03:00.539
a privilege that Satan seeks to attack. Are you a parent with children? Do you think

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:08.419
Satan wants you to become unclean? Yes. He knows that devouring a family head could

00:03:08.419 --> 00:03:16.099
weaken an entire family. In the congregation, Satan would love to devour you dear pioneers,

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:22.139
ministerial servants and elders. Are you in the circuit work? A missionary? A

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:29.699
Bethelite? What a sacred privilege. But remember, it also means that we have a big target

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:37.259
on our back. Satan and the demons would love to penetrate our clean and holy position.

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:45.900
Doing so could impact the kingdom work or stumble others. So we can't be complacent.

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:54.740
We must intensify our efforts to reject all badness. Thus holiness is a vital topic.

00:03:54.740 --> 00:04:02.979
To that end, the theme for this month's program is perfecting holiness in God's fear.

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:08.180
It's based on 2 Corinthians, chapter 7 and verse 1.

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:15.699
To begin, we need to better understand the source of holiness, Jehovah God. As we read

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:21.899
the Bible, we see that holiness is an important quality that Jehovah wants us to know about

00:04:21.899 --> 00:04:28.379
Him. The Bible contains many verses that associate God's name with the words holy and

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:36.459
holiness. Please open your copy of the Bible to one example at Isaiah chapter 6. We'll

00:04:36.459 --> 00:04:45.139
start at Isaiah chapter 6 and verse 1. Now imagine that you are the prophet Isaiah who received

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:52.100
a divine vision. What would you have seen and heard? Let's read verses 1 to 3.

00:04:53.860 --> 00:05:01.300
In the year that King Isaiah died, I saw Jehovah sitting on a lofty and elevated throne,

00:05:02.019 --> 00:05:09.220
and the skirts of his robe filled the temple. Seraphs were standing above him. Each had six wings.

00:05:09.939 --> 00:05:16.019
Each covered his face with two and covered his feet with two, and each of them would fly about

00:05:16.019 --> 00:05:24.980
with two. And one called to the other, holy, holy, holy is Jehovah of armies. The whole earth

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:33.379
is filled with his glory. Isaiah was likely filled with awe. Verse 2 indicates that he saw

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:40.500
seraphs, spirit creatures, evidently a very high rank. What do we learn from their song?

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:48.019
They're repeating the word holy three times, teaches us that Jehovah is holy to the superlative

00:05:48.019 --> 00:05:57.860
degree. No one else is as holy as he is. But what exactly is holiness? What does it mean to be

00:05:58.019 --> 00:06:04.579
holy? Let's dig deeper. We can do so with a helpful tool found in the revised New World

00:06:04.579 --> 00:06:10.339
translation. If you don't have the revised edition in your language, we'll share the key point

00:06:10.339 --> 00:06:17.620
in just a moment. In the revised printed edition, the glossary is located several pages after

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:24.740
revelation, and immediately after the Bible words index. The topics are arranged alphabetically.

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:33.220
So please find the entry for holy holiness. If you're using JW Library,

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:41.139
here are two ways to get to the glossary. In the app, go to the Bible, then at the top of the

00:06:41.139 --> 00:06:48.980
screen tap on the magnifying glass to start a search, then type in the word holy. Soon you'll see

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:56.740
an entry from the glossary. Tap on that. Another way is to go to publications and then books.

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:04.740
From there you can open the glossary and find the entry for holy. Ready? Let's read it.

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:14.740
A quality possessed inherently by Jehovah, a state of absolute moral purity and sacredness.

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:22.100
When referring to humans, animals, things, places, time periods, and activities,

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:25.779
the original Hebrew word conveys the thought of separateness,

00:07:25.779 --> 00:07:33.860
exclusiveness, or sanctification to the holy God. A state of being set aside for Jehovah's service.

00:07:34.819 --> 00:07:39.300
In the Christian Greek scriptures, the words rendered holy and holiness,

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:48.740
likewise denote separation to God. The words are also used to refer to purity in one's personal

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:57.699
conduct. What did we learn? First, we're reminded that Jehovah is pure in the absolute sense.

00:07:58.579 --> 00:08:03.220
But what does it mean that holiness is a quality that he possesses inherently?

00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:12.420
Let's illustrate. Consider the words human and imperfect. Today those two words naturally go

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:20.980
together. Imperfection is within all of us and affects everything we do. Now consider another set

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:32.179
of words that consistently go together. Jehovah and Holy. Holiness permeates Jehovah. He doesn't have

00:08:32.179 --> 00:08:40.340
to perfect holiness like we do. Everything about him is inherently clean, pure, and upright.

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:48.419
What a contrast Jehovah's holiness is to the world around us. Today virtually everything about

00:08:48.419 --> 00:08:55.620
human society alienated from God is polluted in some way, either by inherited imperfection or

00:08:55.620 --> 00:09:04.179
by outright wickedness. But Jehovah is completely removed from sinfulness. He'll never be polluted

00:09:04.179 --> 00:09:12.820
by badness. He'll never turn corrupt, immoral, or abusive. Because he's absolutely holy,

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:23.539
he's completely reliable. This means that Jehovah is the ideal Father. How encouraging and reassuring.

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:33.860
Jehovah's holiness is beautiful. Think about the physical world. How do you feel about beautiful things?

00:09:34.659 --> 00:09:43.379
Are you drawn to them or repelled by them? For example, look at these landscapes. How do they make

00:09:43.379 --> 00:09:51.379
you feel? Would you like to spend time here? Can you see yourself walking here, filling your

00:09:51.379 --> 00:09:59.779
lungs with clean, fresh air? Or how about drinking from a river of pure crystal clear water?

00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:08.980
How we yearn to live in such conditions and we will. But have you ever wondered what it is about

00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:17.620
these images that's so appealing? Simply put, everything is pure and clean. On the other hand,

00:10:18.259 --> 00:10:26.179
if these same locations were filled with garbage, graffiti, and smog, would you still want to be

00:10:26.179 --> 00:10:36.580
there? Likely not. Pollution and filth are not attractive. What's the point? We're naturally drawn

00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:46.740
to beauty. Beauty is associated with things that are clean, pure, and bright. That's how Jehovah wants

00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:55.860
us to view His holiness. Meditating on this aspect of God's personality draws us closer to Him.

00:10:56.899 --> 00:11:05.059
And though He hates all sin, His word confirms that He doesn't hate us. All of this stirs

00:11:05.059 --> 00:11:15.700
within us a desire to perfect holiness. Let's now open to 2 Corinthians, chapter 7 and verse 1.

00:11:15.779 --> 00:11:22.500
Our theme Scripture. Though Paul wrote this to one congregation, Jehovah preserved it for us.

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:24.019
It says,

00:11:25.059 --> 00:11:34.419
Therefore, since we have these promises beloved ones, let us cleanse ourselves of every defilement

00:11:34.419 --> 00:11:43.059
of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God. The concluding part of the verse

00:11:43.059 --> 00:11:49.299
serves as the basis for our theme. What does it mean to perfect something?

00:11:50.259 --> 00:11:56.019
According to one dictionary, to perfect means to bring to a state of supreme excellence,

00:11:56.740 --> 00:12:06.419
to rid of faults, to improve or refine. As an example, perhaps you enjoy a hobby like drawing

00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:13.460
taking photographs or playing an instrument. If an expert in that field told you that you should

00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:20.259
perfect your talent, what would he mean? First, he's confirming that you have some

00:12:20.259 --> 00:12:28.580
experience already. Second, he's telling you, you have what it takes to be even better in the future.

00:12:29.299 --> 00:12:35.779
I can see your potential. Of course, perfecting a hobby takes time.

00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:42.500
The same is true of our holiness. The book, word pictures in the New Testament,

00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:50.179
notes that the word perfecting at 2 Corinthians, chapter 7 and verse 1, means not a sudden

00:12:50.179 --> 00:13:00.019
attainment of complete holiness, but a continuous process. So Jehovah, the expert in holiness,

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:08.980
and our best friend is appealing to us. In effect, he's saying, I see your potential.

00:13:09.779 --> 00:13:16.340
You have what it takes to make progress in holiness. Keep working to perfect it.

00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:25.299
Does such an appeal touch your heart? We could ask ourselves, is there an area in my life where I

00:13:25.299 --> 00:13:32.179
can refine my holiness? For example, consider the matter of physical cleanness.

00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:39.860
Chapter 8 of the book, How to Remain in God's Love, discusses the need to glorify Jehovah by

00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:46.100
keeping our body and clothing, our home and surroundings, and our place of worship clean.

00:13:46.899 --> 00:13:55.379
Being physically clean benefits us and those around us. More important, it honors our Holy Father.

00:13:56.500 --> 00:14:03.299
But our personal cleaning program must go below the surface. In our theme text,

00:14:03.299 --> 00:14:08.740
Jehovah urges us to cleanse ourselves of every defilement of flesh and spirit.

00:14:09.379 --> 00:14:16.340
This involves every aspect of our lives. For example, something we read in the Bible or that

00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:23.539
we hear at a meeting may warn us that our thoughts need further refinement. Perhaps we detect

00:14:23.539 --> 00:14:30.580
a tendency toward materialism, or we realize that our precious time is being consumed by social

00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:39.539
media, surfing the internet, or playing video games. In Ephesians 4, 23 and 24, we're urged to

00:14:39.539 --> 00:14:46.899
continue to be made new in our dominant mental attitude and to put on the new personality.

00:14:47.779 --> 00:14:53.460
So our challenge might be a deeply ingrained, negative personality trait.

00:14:54.419 --> 00:15:01.460
A sister named Kristina admitted, I often find myself looking envyously at others.

00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:08.899
I compare what they have with what I don't have. Well, these are just a few examples,

00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:17.620
and these may not be our weaknesses, but the lesson is clear, all of us need to keep examining

00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:25.539
ourselves. And brothers and sisters, when we identify a personal weakness, what should we do?

00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:33.220
For illustration purposes, let's use the example of Kristina and her battle with envy.

00:15:34.179 --> 00:15:42.659
A three-step program to change our dominant mental attitude was published on page 11 of the June

00:15:42.659 --> 00:15:49.139
2019 study edition of The Watchtower. What's the first thing Kristina should do?

00:15:50.019 --> 00:15:57.139
Step 1. She needs to talk to Jehovah, admitting that she recognizes the need to change.

00:15:58.019 --> 00:16:05.299
If she prays regularly for Jehovah to put within her a new spirit, our Holy God will help her.

00:16:06.259 --> 00:16:13.220
Step 2. She needs to meditate, so as to examine herself in the mirror of God's Word.

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:21.940
For example, she might think deeply about the fact that love is not jealous and does not look

00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:31.220
for its own interests. This would help Kristina to hate envy. Step 3. She needs to assess her

00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:40.019
relationships and choose good association. Could it be that negative gossip either in person or

00:16:40.019 --> 00:16:46.980
online is shaping her thinking? If so, she'd be wise to choose better association.

00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:56.019
Yes, Jehovah's blessing upon Kristina's personal efforts will enable her to perfect holiness.

00:16:56.740 --> 00:17:00.820
These three steps can help us do the same.

00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:10.099
Let's now review our key points. First, wickedness is going from bad to worse,

00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:20.099
so we need to intensify our efforts to be holy. Second, since Jehovah is the source of holiness,

00:17:20.579 --> 00:17:29.220
everything about Him is clean, pure, and upright. This beautiful quality draws us to Him and moves

00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:39.539
us to be holy. Third, and most important, Jehovah appeals to us to cleanse ourselves of every

00:17:39.539 --> 00:17:48.420
defilement of flesh and spirit. So may we accept Jehovah's help and work to perfect holiness

00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:57.140
in God's fear. Even as we strive to perfect holiness, we don't look down on people who have

00:17:57.140 --> 00:18:04.180
been molded by the world around us. In the following experience from Italy, notice how a group

00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:12.259
of young men who had a rough start in life were drawn to the truths and what a courageous sister did

00:18:12.259 --> 00:18:24.740
to reach their hearts. Our parents loved us, but they did it the wrong way. They would often turn

00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:33.230
violent, so we learned that way of life. I remember that since I was young, I was afraid of coming

00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:38.509
home one day and not finding my parents together, because as far as I remember, they have always argued

00:18:38.509 --> 00:18:46.589
with each other. So we grew up with those values and those ways of thinking that led us to become a group

00:18:46.589 --> 00:18:53.069
that was known and feared in the area because of our violent, immoral lifestyle devoted to drugs.

00:18:55.980 --> 00:19:06.930
We had no rules. We were people that you should stay away from. It was one of those regular mornings

00:19:06.930 --> 00:19:12.450
when we were home and on, and it used to become our hideout, the place we would meet.

00:19:13.410 --> 00:19:20.609
We had skip school and our parents didn't know. I was with the Rico Enra family. When two sisters,

00:19:20.609 --> 00:19:28.529
two of Jehovah's Witnesses rang the doorbell. So we had them come in so we could make fun of them

00:19:28.529 --> 00:19:35.569
and as a matter of fact that's what we did. I remember that Maria and the sister that was with her

00:19:35.569 --> 00:19:42.130
were two very sincere and genuine people. They showed courage as they brought us the truth.

00:19:46.509 --> 00:19:52.109
I was surprised that they were so kind despite my tone of voice was mocking and I really appreciated

00:19:52.109 --> 00:19:57.150
their kindness. She didn't let anything stop her, not even the way we looked.

00:19:58.750 --> 00:20:04.589
I was really touched by the conversation with Maria but I thought I would never see her again.

00:20:06.349 --> 00:20:19.140
Who would ever come back to people like us? Maria didn't give up. She came back with an older

00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:23.779
pineal brother who wasn't scared of us and with courage started to preach.

00:20:24.019 --> 00:20:32.900
I really started to change my life and make progress. Immediately I started to speak about what I was

00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:40.180
learning with all my friends. What surprised me was my mother's reaction. She wasn't happy at all.

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:53.619
She reacted really violently. They thought that I was I was going mad that it was being brainwashed.

00:20:53.619 --> 00:21:00.500
I remember they would do everything to remind me of the strong friendship that was between us

00:21:01.059 --> 00:21:08.769
so they would put pressure on me emotionally. I had to make a choice although I did love them

00:21:08.769 --> 00:21:16.529
and was close to them. I made the drastic decision to tell them that from then on I would no longer

00:21:16.529 --> 00:21:23.859
be staying in their company. This situation made me really intrigued. In fact I ended up studying

00:21:23.859 --> 00:21:31.380
with Francesco. His determination really made me think. It was obvious that the things he was

00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:39.380
telling us were actually real. It was the truth and also the strength it took to go forward with this.

00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:46.180
His determination to leave his friends was surely what made all of us seriously interested in

00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:52.819
the message he was preaching. I would blame it on the truth because he was taking my friend away

00:21:52.819 --> 00:21:59.700
from me, a friend with whom I used to do the things I liked. However inside I knew even though

00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:04.740
I told him he had gone mad I knew inside that there must have been something powerful

00:22:06.579 --> 00:22:13.299
because he was so convinced and we could all sense his conviction. So I realized that there was

00:22:13.299 --> 00:22:20.980
really something there. To my surprise one after the other all of my friends started studying the

00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:28.420
Bible. As I studied I realized that it was the truth. It used to be hatred that always motivated

00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:37.460
my choices. Now I act according to love and this makes me feel good. I can now say that

00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:43.460
thanks to Maria and Francesco Jehovah tried to draw me to him. I believe it's been a miracle

00:22:43.539 --> 00:22:51.460
from Jehovah. The truth helped me cultivate the qualities of peace and joy, the personality that

00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:58.420
has made it possible for me to have the family I never had. The greatest satisfaction I have in

00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:05.700
life is to have a relationship with Jehovah. When I see someone like me used to be I feel motivated

00:23:05.779 --> 00:23:11.299
to speak to them. The patients that Maria showed motivates me to be patient.

00:23:13.059 --> 00:23:23.940
Despite our reputation Maria did not give up. She showed us that in Jehovah's eyes no one is beyond

00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:35.230
recovery. No one. Before they found the truth those young men were as they put it people you

00:23:35.230 --> 00:23:42.589
should stay away from. Would you have hesitated to give a witness? Our sister Maria didn't.

00:23:43.309 --> 00:23:48.829
And did you notice what our brother did when he embraced the truth? He went to his friends and

00:23:48.829 --> 00:23:55.630
broke off his association. He knew he needed friends who shared his determination to serve God.

00:23:56.509 --> 00:24:05.470
So do we. We see the wonderful results. All of them are now brothers. They cleansed themselves.

00:24:06.269 --> 00:24:13.150
And what was the most meaningful transformation? Our brother said it. It used to be hatred that

00:24:13.150 --> 00:24:21.309
motivated my choices. Now it's love. Whether we're new in the truth or have served Jehovah for

00:24:21.309 --> 00:24:29.309
decades we can perfect holiness and move forward as spiritual people. We'll see that in our next

00:24:29.309 --> 00:24:48.259
segment. Look for how our brothers applied good suggestions from the watchtower. The challenge of

00:24:48.259 --> 00:24:52.579
serving in a foreign country can sometimes be that because you've made that move and you've

00:24:52.579 --> 00:24:58.420
learned a foreign language you can feel like you've done enough. I was brought up by a witness

00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:04.660
mother so I studied the Bible since I was small so I thought I had Bible knowledge to some extent.

00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:13.220
My wife and I have enjoyed the traveling work for 18 years. As we get older trials that we never

00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:20.019
experienced when we were young come up one after another. After I got married and had children

00:25:21.059 --> 00:25:26.500
I had a hard time explaining the backgrounds of some Bible characters or biblical history.

00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:35.970
When I studied the Bible with my children then I realized that I did not have enough Bible knowledge.

00:25:37.410 --> 00:25:42.849
And another challenge can be that you're dealing with a foreign culture in the territory but you

00:25:42.849 --> 00:25:48.609
also have many different cultures in the congregation. When I struggle to fulfill various

00:25:48.609 --> 00:25:55.490
responsibilities in a balanced way things such as caring for aged parents and our own health

00:25:55.490 --> 00:26:00.289
issues can be a source of stress and cause tension between my wife and me.

00:26:01.890 --> 00:26:08.289
The study article moved forward as a spiritual person in February 2018 was a big help.

00:26:09.730 --> 00:26:15.329
The expressions once we have identified areas for improvement we need to take positive steps

00:26:15.329 --> 00:26:19.970
and that it is a life and death matter really touched my heart.

00:26:20.289 --> 00:26:27.490
I realized that I needed to scrutinize my life seriously and make improvements for my own future

00:26:27.490 --> 00:26:33.250
and that of my family. The article had a quote from Brother Barr that said many fail because they're

00:26:33.250 --> 00:26:39.809
not diligent enough to grow mighty. This made me think am I mighty enough to overcome any

00:26:39.809 --> 00:26:45.329
challenges that might come up difficulties with brothers and sisters in a way that pleases Jehovah.

00:26:46.130 --> 00:26:50.849
To move ahead is a spiritual person I realized I needed to get Jehovah's thinking on matters

00:26:50.849 --> 00:26:56.769
and really look at Bible principles and that means letting go of my pride when it comes back,

00:26:56.769 --> 00:27:01.089
letting go of it again and really making Jehovah's thoughts my own thoughts.

00:27:03.009 --> 00:27:09.890
I have a bad tendency to try to do everything by myself and to not delegate things to others.

00:27:10.529 --> 00:27:19.619
I ask myself, what decision will please Jehovah? Make sure of the more important things.

00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:24.980
I felt the need to train younger brothers in the congregation so that I could

00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:31.940
delegate responsibilities to them. The article encouraged us to look to Bible principles and

00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:38.019
two that really helped me were Proverbs chapter 15, verse 28 and Philippians chapter 2, verse 4

00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:45.619
because it helped me to think about what is in the person's best interest before I responded to

00:27:45.619 --> 00:27:53.619
them. I took time when reading Bible accounts to meditate on how I would feel if I were one of those

00:27:53.619 --> 00:28:06.720
Bible characters. I can now explain things better at my children's study. I'm very happy to see

00:28:06.799 --> 00:28:14.880
my children truly enjoying Christian activities. My son started doing play meetings for fun.

00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:21.279
My daughter loves the ministry. She talks to people willingly, not because we as parents

00:28:21.279 --> 00:28:27.519
are telling her to do so. Compared to how it was when I was a child, things are totally different now

00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:38.240
and that really makes me happy. By applying this principle I can lighten my load and reduce my stress

00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:46.589
level. In turn, that helps me to maintain joy, to strengthen our relationship as a couple

00:28:47.710 --> 00:28:52.190
and I feel I've become more approachable to those in the congregation.

00:28:53.869 --> 00:28:58.269
Having the mind of Christ has helped me in my assignment because it's helped me to form

00:28:58.269 --> 00:29:02.829
really close friendships with the brothers and sisters in my congregation and that's brought me

00:29:02.829 --> 00:29:09.789
a lot of joy in my service. And also when I don't know what to do, which often happens,

00:29:09.789 --> 00:29:14.990
I have Jehovah's principles to guide me and that makes me feel safe and secure.

00:29:32.259 --> 00:29:39.220
Family Heads. Did you notice how Yusk took to heart the suggestion to analyze his life

00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:44.660
and look for ways to improve? He realized that while he had some Bible knowledge,

00:29:44.660 --> 00:29:50.980
he needed to deepen it through study and meditation. That made him a more effective teacher for his

00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:59.380
children. Jane was doing fine work as a pioneer in a foreign land. Yet ironically she had difficulty

00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:07.220
with brothers and sisters from different cultures. Do we? What stood in her way? She said,

00:30:07.220 --> 00:30:13.700
I had to let go of my pride. Once she did, Jehovah's thoughts became her thoughts.

00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:21.539
Perhaps like Yutaka Kimura, you're dealing with changing life circumstances. What do we learn from

00:30:21.539 --> 00:30:29.059
his example? He delegated responsibilities and reordered his priorities. That took humility.

00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:38.500
The result? Reduced stress and increased joy. Often honest self-examination reveals the

00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:44.500
root cause of something we need to adjust. We'll see that in the following dramatization.

00:31:00.220 --> 00:31:28.430
I embarrassed my wife tonight. I knew when it happened. And I didn't want to talk about it.

00:31:28.430 --> 00:31:41.119
But I knew in my heart that Yumi was right. I had become unkind. There were lots of examples.

00:31:46.079 --> 00:31:49.680
I complained about the way one brother conducts meetings for field service.

00:31:57.009 --> 00:32:19.470
I was jealous of a ministerial servant who received new privileges. And I was pretty blunt,

00:32:19.470 --> 00:32:33.940
but how frustrated I get with Yumi's parents. I thought I'd gotten rid of my old personality,

00:32:34.819 --> 00:32:45.410
but it still lurked inside of me. Some of my friends were okay with and even encouraged these

00:32:45.410 --> 00:32:54.160
bad qualities. The change was so gradual, I didn't even realize how far I'd fallen.

00:32:55.920 --> 00:33:00.799
What do you think I need to do to change? How about we search for good for building up from

00:33:00.799 --> 00:33:15.009
the online library? Sounds good. Let's take a look. We considered Ephesians chapter 4, verse 29,

00:33:15.009 --> 00:33:21.809
which says, let a rotten word not come out of your mouth. But only what is good for building up

00:33:21.809 --> 00:33:31.440
to impart what is beneficial to the ears. I was struck by this powerful word picture.

00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:44.559
Rotten words are as disgusting as rotten food. I didn't want the things coming out of my mouth

00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:56.589
to discuss my life or anyone else. But to change, I needed a plan. Now, I really tried to think

00:33:56.589 --> 00:34:14.829
before I speak, and I have a goal to give someone real accommodation at every meeting. I have a

00:34:14.829 --> 00:34:26.619
goal from my conversations too. I want to keep them wholesome, true, and kind. It's amazing how

00:34:26.699 --> 00:34:37.409
speaking kindly to others can make you feel so good inside. I shouldn't be surprised

00:34:38.289 --> 00:34:47.630
because it's just another way of showing God's love. I don't think I'll ever forget that image of

00:34:47.630 --> 00:34:55.710
the rotten fruit, but isn't that the point? No one wants their words and conversations to be like

00:34:55.710 --> 00:35:03.469
that. We want to perfect holiness with clean conversations. How do we keep our speech

00:35:03.469 --> 00:35:10.829
up building and kind? Like our brother, we need to look within ourselves. What's causing us to

00:35:10.829 --> 00:35:17.869
say hurtful things? He discovered the old personality still lurking inside, and he realized some

00:35:17.869 --> 00:35:24.829
of his friends were actually encouraging his critical attitude. But he did more than analyze

00:35:24.829 --> 00:35:34.429
himself. He made a plan and set goals. As his thinking changed, so did his speech. That drew

00:35:34.429 --> 00:35:43.550
people to him, and he felt good inside. As that brother realized, sometimes, even without noticing it,

00:35:43.550 --> 00:35:50.829
we could move backward spiritually. We need to move forward, perfecting holiness.

00:35:51.789 --> 00:35:58.030
We'll next hear from a brother who took more than a step or two backward. Notice what helped him

00:35:58.030 --> 00:36:18.780
regain his relationship with Jehovah. My first contact with witnesses was in my 20s. As my

00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:24.300
knowledge increased, I made drastic changes. I quit smoking, stopped swearing and using drugs.

00:36:25.019 --> 00:36:31.739
I also changed my violent behavior. I completely gave up martial arts, and then I was baptized

00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:36.460
as one of Jehovah's Witnesses. It was an amazing day that I would never forget.

00:36:44.590 --> 00:36:50.429
Shortly after my baptism, I became quite involved in my work at the theater. The environment

00:36:50.429 --> 00:36:57.150
was very immoral, you know. Even after several loving warnings from the brothers in the congregation,

00:36:57.150 --> 00:37:03.309
advising me to look for another job, I choose not to follow their advice. I'd worked there for a long

00:37:03.309 --> 00:37:12.670
time, so I thought I can handle it, but that was wrong. My conscience became dull, and I committed

00:37:12.670 --> 00:37:23.789
a serious sin against Jehovah. When I left the truth, several office came my way. I became a manager

00:37:23.789 --> 00:37:30.110
at a nightclub that was open until 6 in the morning. He was a lot of parties, and it was a lot of

00:37:30.110 --> 00:37:44.719
drugs. I also received martial arts. I came in contact with serious criminals, and gradually became

00:37:44.719 --> 00:37:53.230
friends with the most influential person in the criminal underworld in Oslo. Eventually, I was

00:37:54.030 --> 00:38:01.539
in prison for my violent behavior. Christian movement visited the prison where I was,

00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:08.900
and all of the inmates were invited to an event where they would be cake served. That sounded

00:38:08.900 --> 00:38:17.460
very interesting. I was tempted by a cake. They also played music, but after a while, I started

00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:24.579
speaking in tongues, and I felt very uncomfortable. I didn't want to be involved in that, but I couldn't

00:38:24.579 --> 00:38:30.260
get up. Even though I was big and strong back then, I physically couldn't stand up from my chair.

00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:38.579
I've experienced a lot in my life, but at that moment, I was genuinely scared. So I cried out to

00:38:38.579 --> 00:38:46.659
Jehovah immediately. I was released, and I was able to get up and leave. This big man was now

00:38:46.659 --> 00:38:55.780
in a fetal position crying, and then I called my wife and asked her to bring me a Bible and some

00:38:55.780 --> 00:39:06.500
literature. I had to start studying again and draw close to Jehovah. The greatest challenge was

00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:12.500
prayer to start communicating with Jehovah again after being so far away from him,

00:39:12.500 --> 00:39:22.139
doing all these bad things. You know, it was a long way to go. One scripture I especially

00:39:22.139 --> 00:39:30.619
remember is Isaiah 118, where he says, come now, let us set matter straight between us,

00:39:31.980 --> 00:39:39.980
that touch me deeply. He also says that if your sins are red like scarlet,

00:39:40.940 --> 00:39:48.460
Jehovah will make them white as snow. It felt like he separated the darkness and stretched out

00:39:48.460 --> 00:40:02.539
his hand and pulled me out back into the light again. Six months after I was reinstated, my wife

00:40:02.539 --> 00:40:11.469
decided to dedicate her life to Jehovah and was baptized. She has been a huge support during my

00:40:11.550 --> 00:40:22.460
return. I was very nervous at first, but when I entered the kingdom hall, that feeling just

00:40:22.460 --> 00:40:29.659
disappeared. God's spirit is here. The way the brothers and sisters acted towards each other

00:40:29.659 --> 00:40:42.929
was such a contrast to my former lifestyle. We feel deeply blessed by Jehovah. Of course,

00:40:43.489 --> 00:40:51.489
you make mistakes once in a while, but now I feel confident that Jehovah is merciful.

00:40:56.739 --> 00:41:02.739
At his lowest point, Peter said he felt so far away from Jehovah.

00:41:03.780 --> 00:41:11.300
If you can relate to his situation in some way, be assured that you too can set matter straight.

00:41:12.099 --> 00:41:19.139
You can experience what Peter did. Jehovah helping him out of the darkness into the light again.

00:41:20.179 --> 00:41:29.059
Remember, Jehovah is saying to you and to all of us, I see your potential. You have what it takes.

00:41:30.420 --> 00:41:36.420
Today, some of the greatest challenges are faced by our young people. This month's music video

00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:42.420
was made especially for them. It's entitled, Fight the Find Fight of the Faith.

00:41:42.420 --> 00:45:38.719
Jehovah see it. What a beautiful song and a beautiful reminder.

00:45:39.519 --> 00:45:46.960
Jehovah does help us to win our fight of the faith. In what ways? As we saw in the video,

00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:53.119
he helps us through our family and fellow worshipers through the ministry and through his word

00:45:53.119 --> 00:46:01.119
the Bible. Preserving God's word and his personal name has been a fierce fight over many centuries,

00:46:01.119 --> 00:46:07.440
a fight that's being won. This is the subject of the Bible Museum at World Headquarters in Warwick,

00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:17.840
New York. Let's take a brief tour. The Bible is a modern day treasure. It reveals the satisfying

00:46:17.840 --> 00:46:25.360
truth about God, life, and our hope for the future. What's more, it contains another

00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:33.920
priceless treasure. God's personal name, Jehovah. How Jehovah preserved his name in the holy

00:46:33.920 --> 00:46:40.960
scriptures against all attempts to remove it is a fascinating story. And it's told here,

00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:46.480
in the Bible Museum at World Headquarters in Warwick. Let's take the tour.

00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:57.119
At the museum's entry, the divine name is shown in various languages a total of 7,216 times.

00:46:57.920 --> 00:47:02.719
That's how many times it appears in the new world translation of the holy scriptures.

00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:09.920
Jehovah always made his name known, even to the very first humans. When Cain was born,

00:47:10.559 --> 00:47:16.480
Eve declared, I have produced a male child with the help of Jehovah.

00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:26.559
After that time, people knew and used God's name. The oldest example of the divine name in Hebrew

00:47:26.639 --> 00:47:35.920
letters is on the Moabite Stone from the 9th century BCE. Moabite King Misha boasted against Israel.

00:47:36.559 --> 00:47:42.000
I took from it the vessels of Jehovah and offered them before Kymash.

00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:49.199
There's also evidence that in ancient times, God's name was used in everyday life.

00:47:50.159 --> 00:47:58.320
This silver scroll from the 7th century BCE is the earliest known inscription of a Bible text

00:47:58.320 --> 00:48:01.760
containing God's name. It reads,

00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:07.360
Majorhovah bless you and keep you. Majorhovah make his face shine on you.

00:48:08.159 --> 00:48:13.280
Most important, God's name was in ancient copies of the Bible text.

00:48:14.079 --> 00:48:21.519
The Fouad Papyrus from the 1st century BCE is a fragment of the Greek Septuagint,

00:48:21.519 --> 00:48:29.360
the first known translation of the Hebrew scriptures into Greek. Here's Deuteronomy chapter 32,

00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:37.280
verse 3, for I will declare the name of Jehovah. Although the text is in Greek,

00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:45.360
the divine name is written in Hebrew. Greek speaking Jews in Jesus' day used the Septuagint.

00:48:46.079 --> 00:48:51.760
So when Jesus read and taught from the scriptures, people heard him use the divine name.

00:48:53.360 --> 00:49:01.199
Sadly, though, by the 3rd century CE, God's name was removed from the Septuagint and replaced

00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:09.920
with the title Lord. As an example, the Vatican codex from the 4th century CE includes the text

00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:17.599
of the Greek Septuagint, but omits God's name. Deuteronomy chapter 32, verse 3, here reads,

00:49:18.159 --> 00:49:25.199
for I will declare the name of the Lord. But Jehovah wouldn't allow his name to be lost.

00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:32.960
It was never removed from Hebrew copies of the Bible. The Aleppo codex was copied by Jewish

00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:41.920
scribes around the year 930 CE. The same verse, Deuteronomy chapter 32, verse 3 says in Hebrew,

00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:51.920
for I will declare the name of Jehovah. Still, for centuries, most people didn't have a Bible

00:49:51.920 --> 00:50:00.639
in their own language, nor one that contained God's name. The Latin Vulgate translated around

00:50:00.639 --> 00:50:09.039
405 CE omitted the divine name. It became the official translation of the Catholic Church for

00:50:09.039 --> 00:50:16.960
over 1,000 years. But a new technology triggered events that would soon make the Bible

00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:23.280
widely available and infresh translations that return God's name to its rightful place.

00:50:24.320 --> 00:50:32.719
About 1453, Johannes Gutenberg produced an important edition of the Latin Vulgate. It was the first

00:50:32.719 --> 00:50:42.159
Bible printed using movable type. This is an original page from a Gutenberg Bible. While only

00:50:42.159 --> 00:50:48.400
some 180 Bibles were made, his invention sparked the printing revolution.

00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:58.320
Just 20 years later, Anton Kohlberger was printing up to 1,000 Bibles per run, making it the first

00:50:58.320 --> 00:51:06.480
mass-produced Bible. On display is an original copy of the second edition of Kohlberger's Latin

00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:16.559
Bible from 1477. Then, in the early 1500s, Bible scholars took a renewed interest in the original

00:51:16.559 --> 00:51:23.760
Bible languages. For the very first time, the original language Hebrew and Greek scriptures were

00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:32.079
printed together. This is the Completency in Polyglot, printed between 1514 and 1517.

00:51:33.039 --> 00:51:39.920
A polyglot is a book with text in several languages arranged in columns. In the Completency

00:51:39.920 --> 00:51:49.440
in Polyglot, the Bible text appears in Latin, Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek. Comparing the Hebrew

00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:56.719
text with the Latin, scholars could see where God's name had been replaced in the Latin Vulgate

00:51:56.800 --> 00:52:04.719
with Lord. But would seeing the divine name in the original Hebrew text lead Bible translators

00:52:04.719 --> 00:52:15.679
to restore God's name in their translations? Indeed, some did. In 1551, Sebastian Castelio

00:52:15.679 --> 00:52:22.960
published his fresh Latin translation of the Bible. He appears to be the first to use God's name

00:52:22.960 --> 00:52:30.320
consistently in a Latin translation of the Hebrew scriptures. Translations into other languages

00:52:30.320 --> 00:52:39.280
were also using God's name. In 1530, William Tyndale published his English translation of Genesis

00:52:39.280 --> 00:52:45.679
through Deuteronomy. It was the first time that the vine name appeared in any English Bible.

00:52:46.559 --> 00:52:55.280
The popular Reina Valera Spanish Bible was published in 1602. It contains the divine name throughout

00:52:55.280 --> 00:53:04.400
the Hebrew scriptures. This is a rare original first edition of the English King James version

00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:12.719
of the Bible, published in 1611. It uses the name Jehovah in just four passages. Still,

00:53:13.360 --> 00:53:20.880
the King James version became the most widely printed book in the world. Some 200 years later,

00:53:20.880 --> 00:53:27.599
Benjamin Boothworth, a minister and Hebrew scholar, set out to revise the King James version.

00:53:28.639 --> 00:53:36.320
His 1817 translation was the first English Bible to use the divine name throughout the Hebrew

00:53:36.400 --> 00:53:44.480
scriptures. Meanwhile, church missionaries were taking the Bible to new lands, but without the

00:53:44.480 --> 00:53:50.960
divine name, people couldn't distinguish the God of the Bible from their own false gods.

00:53:51.599 --> 00:53:59.039
So Bible translations and many languages of Asia, Africa, the Pacific Islands, and the Americas

00:53:59.039 --> 00:54:07.599
included God's name. The Chinese delegates version from 1854 is an example of a missionary

00:54:07.599 --> 00:54:16.400
Bible that uses God's name throughout the Hebrew scriptures. Still, there was one more place where

00:54:16.400 --> 00:54:25.519
God's name was not yet restored, the Christian Greek scriptures. This is the Nuremberg Polyglot,

00:54:25.519 --> 00:54:33.840
published by Elias Hutter in 1599. It contains the Christian Greek scriptures in 12 languages,

00:54:33.840 --> 00:54:42.000
including Hebrew. Here, John's Gospel quotes Psalm 118 verse 26,

00:54:42.880 --> 00:54:49.840
Blessed is the one who comes in Jehovah's name. In his Hebrew translation of the Gospel,

00:54:49.840 --> 00:54:57.119
Hunter preserved the divine name in the quotation from Psalms. He did this in many other places in

00:54:57.119 --> 00:55:04.719
the Greek scriptures. Translators had a precedent to use God's name in the Christian Greek

00:55:04.719 --> 00:55:12.639
scriptures where the name appeared in verses quoted from the Hebrew scriptures. This is the 1864

00:55:12.639 --> 00:55:20.559
6th edition New Testament translation by Herman Heinfetter. It's likely the first published

00:55:20.559 --> 00:55:27.119
English Bible to use God's name in more than 100 places in the Christian Greek scriptures.

00:55:28.960 --> 00:55:36.800
The New World translation of the Holy Scriptures was first published between 1950 and 1960.

00:55:37.519 --> 00:55:43.840
Its translators benefited from the scholarly work of those before them who had chosen

00:55:43.840 --> 00:55:52.000
to preserve God's name in their Bible translations. Today, the New World translation is available

00:55:52.000 --> 00:56:01.920
in whole or in part in over 170 languages. God's name, Jehovah, belongs in the Holy Scriptures

00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:12.559
he inspired. This gallery holds just a small part of the overwhelming evidence to this fact.

00:56:13.519 --> 00:56:20.880
The Bible is a precious gift from God, teaching us about His works, His qualities,

00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:28.880
and His loving purpose for humankind. He invites each of us to read it, to draw close to Him,

00:56:28.880 --> 00:56:34.079
and to know Him by His most holy name, Jehovah.

00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:44.960
Our program has focused on perfecting holiness in God's fear. Perfecting holiness may sound

00:56:44.960 --> 00:56:52.320
out of reach, but remember, it's a continuous process. We saw this with those young men in Italy

00:56:52.400 --> 00:56:59.840
who left behind their violent and immoral ways. And with Jane, Yusuke, and Yutaka, we saw

00:56:59.840 --> 00:57:06.480
experienced Christians who found ways to grow as spiritual people. We learned how to make our

00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:14.320
speech more upbuilding by examining our motives and associations. Peter Heinrich's experience

00:57:14.320 --> 00:57:21.199
demonstrates that it's possible to return to Jehovah with his help. Finally, our music video

00:57:21.199 --> 00:57:27.599
reminds us that despite the unique pressures our young people face, they're winning the fight.

00:57:28.960 --> 00:57:33.519
We close with a visit to our brothers and sisters in Puerto Rico.

00:57:35.440 --> 00:57:43.679
Secluded beaches, lush valleys, mountains, this beautiful island is home to more than three

00:57:43.679 --> 00:57:50.880
million inhabitants and nearly 24,000 Jehovah's Witnesses. But it's location in the

00:57:50.880 --> 00:57:58.320
Caribbean puts Puerto Rico in the path of tropical storms and hurricanes. One of the most powerful

00:57:58.320 --> 00:58:05.519
ever, Hurricane Maria, struck two years ago. Lives were lost, and homes were destroyed.

00:58:06.159 --> 00:58:11.840
The entire island lost electricity for months. To help with relief efforts,

00:58:11.840 --> 00:58:16.480
thousands of brothers and sisters from Puerto Rico and from across the United States

00:58:16.559 --> 00:58:23.199
branch territory volunteered. They repaired and rebuilt 106 kingdom halls,

00:58:23.840 --> 00:58:28.559
two assembly halls, and more than 800 homes of our brothers.

00:58:29.760 --> 00:58:35.760
The Baraona congregation, located in the middle of the island, was enjoying their circuit

00:58:35.760 --> 00:58:41.360
overseer visit when the hurricane hit. The body of elders and the circuit overseer

00:58:41.360 --> 00:58:45.519
immediately organized and reached out to everyone in the congregation.

00:58:46.400 --> 00:58:53.840
Despite the devastation, the Sunday meeting took place as scheduled. In fact,

00:58:53.840 --> 00:58:59.760
despite dealing with challenging conditions for many months, the congregation didn't cancel a

00:58:59.760 --> 00:59:06.559
single meeting. Within a few days of Hurricane Maria, the organized preaching work resumed,

00:59:06.639 --> 00:59:12.159
and our brothers were back in the field. The response has been encouraging.

00:59:12.960 --> 00:59:22.480
50 Bible studies are now being conducted. The 117 publishers in the Baraona congregation

00:59:22.480 --> 00:59:30.719
send you their warm Christian love and greetings. From the World Headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:59:30.719 --> 00:59:39.360
this is J.W. Broadcasting.
