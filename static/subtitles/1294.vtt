00:00:03.279 --> 00:00:11.279
Resting quietly, between the Bay of Bengal and the Andaman Sea are the hundreds of Andaman and Nikobar islands.

00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:17.280
Around 30,000 people speak Nikobaris, a language unique to these islands.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:22.280
Some of our literature was translated into Nikobaris in the early 2000s.

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:27.280
But the time came for them to have their own translation team.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:32.280
So in 2007, the India branch sent two brothers to organize it.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:37.280
And the brothers soon found many obstacles to overcome before the translation work could begin.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:44.280
After searching for a while, we found potential candidates who could read, write and speak Nikobaris fluently.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.280
And we encouraged them to use their skills for translation.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.850
They really prepared their hearts to benefit from the training given.

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.850
I was excited and at the same time frightened.

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:06.849
I know the seriousness of the responsibility as translation is done for those who do not understand another language.

00:01:06.849 --> 00:01:12.849
The brother who came to give training always told us,

00:01:12.849 --> 00:01:17.849
if you make yourself available, Chahobar will make you capable.

00:01:17.849 --> 00:01:24.849
The best location for work would have been on the Nikobar islands where the Nikobaris speaking people live.

00:01:24.849 --> 00:01:29.849
But it was restricted after the devastating tsunami in 2004.

00:01:29.849 --> 00:01:35.849
The brothers couldn't leave their jobs and go to the branch because it's over 1,000 miles away.

00:01:35.849 --> 00:01:40.849
So the capital of the islands or blend was the best place to work.

00:01:40.849 --> 00:01:46.849
Some had to travel 24 hours by sea from different islands to get there.

00:01:46.849 --> 00:01:49.849
But there were a lot of difficulties.

00:01:49.849 --> 00:01:52.849
Our language has a limited vocabulary.

00:01:52.849 --> 00:01:54.849
That is a challenge for us.

00:01:54.849 --> 00:01:57.849
But as a team, we try to resolve it.

00:01:57.849 --> 00:02:02.849
During the preparation, if we find something which is difficult to translate,

00:02:02.849 --> 00:02:08.849
the three of us give their suggestions and we try to find a simpler way of translating

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.849
so the target audience gets the point.

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:21.419
In December 2004, a tsunami devastated the islands,

00:02:21.419 --> 00:02:25.419
leaving many in search of comfort.

00:02:27.419 --> 00:02:31.419
During the tsunami period, those who never wanted to hear the good news,

00:02:31.419 --> 00:02:36.419
wanted to come in this small room where we used to conduct our meetings.

00:02:36.419 --> 00:02:44.419
So I told them the meeting can be conducted in the open ground where all the tsunami victims were gathering.

00:02:44.419 --> 00:02:49.419
They agreed because they were eager to hear the truth.

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:55.419
Soon afterward, the tract would you like to know the truth was translated into Nicobaris.

00:02:55.419 --> 00:02:59.960
It immediately had a positive effect.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.960
When people saw the tract in their language, they were very happy.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.960
On one island, more than 20 people read the tract.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:14.960
Most of them have now dedicated themselves to serve Jehovah.

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:20.960
Among them were Bonafos Joseph and his wife, Paulina Lucas.

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.960
The last question affected us.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.960
How can I find happiness in life?

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:33.960
We were happy because the way it answered was very simple and easy to understand.

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.960
We were moved to learn more about the truth.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.960
There were other questions we never knew before,

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:44.960
such as what happens to us when we die and will suffering ever end?

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:49.960
Even though the tsunami almost naged away everything some of this brother's head,

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:55.960
they are now even more determined to use their abilities in Jehovah's service.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:00.960
In the field ministry, I met a lady and gave her one of her tracks.

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:07.590
She was happy to see it in her own language because it is totally a new thing to them.

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:11.590
As we don't have any secular magazines in our own language.

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.589
People in the congregation benefit from it.

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:20.589
Even new Bible students are benefited who did not read well.

00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:24.589
But now they can understand what they are reading because it is in their language.

00:04:24.589 --> 00:04:26.589
It reaches their heart.

00:04:29.589 --> 00:04:33.589
Nikobari literature has helped me to keep my faith strong.

00:04:33.589 --> 00:04:39.589
Because now when I read, I can fully understand the meaning and meditate on what I am reading.

00:04:40.589 --> 00:04:46.589
I feel God uses translation as a tool to help people to know more about Him

00:04:46.589 --> 00:04:50.589
and attract them to the truth and save their life.

00:04:50.589 --> 00:04:57.589
With Jehovah's blessing, the challenging work of translating the good news of his kingdom into Nikobaris

00:04:57.589 --> 00:05:01.589
is contributing to the words of Isaiah 42-12.

00:05:01.589 --> 00:05:06.589
Let them attribute glory to Jehovah and declare his praise in the islands.
