00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:09.150
What qualities does the Bible say would characterize people living during the last days?

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:15.849
Would you say unity and peace or disunity and selfishness?

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:21.949
Well, actually, both answers are correct, depending on which group of people we're talking about.

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:26.149
The Apostle Paul was inspired to write at 2 Timothy 3 verses 1 through 5,

00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:31.050
that among other things, people in general would be lovers of themselves,

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.049
not open to any agreement and fears.

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:41.850
But the prophet Michael also was inspired to write regarding the last days,

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.450
prophecy that we're seeing fulfilled on our day. What did he write?

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:51.649
I invite you to open to Micah chapter 2, and notice with me, please, verse 12.

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.850
Micah chapter 2 verse 12, and here we find the word of Jehovah that came to Micah.

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.450
What did Jehovah say?

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.950
I will certainly gather all of you, O Jacob.

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:07.250
I will surely collect the remaining ones of Israel together.

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:13.549
In unity, I will place them like sheep in the pen, like a flock in its pasture.

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:17.150
It will be noisy with people.

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.349
In unity, I will place them.

00:01:20.349 --> 00:01:26.250
Since 1919, anointed Christians have been collected together like sheep in the pen.

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.549
And being joined by other sheep, they have become noisy with people.

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:36.450
Yes, we zealously promote pure worship and find a light in our association.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:43.250
And with 9 million, nearly 9 million of Jehovah's people, that's a lot of joyful chatter.

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.849
Have you attended this year's convention yet?

00:01:45.849 --> 00:01:47.349
You're in for a treat.

00:01:47.349 --> 00:01:55.950
There you'll enjoy a banquet of spiritual food and the peace and unity that characterizes Jehovah's happy people.

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:02.349
Well, who is responsible for the peace and unity that we enjoy?

00:02:02.349 --> 00:02:06.450
Well, if we look back at the verse there, Jehovah himself says,

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.449
in unity, I will place them like sheep in the pen.

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:14.250
So Jehovah is responsible.

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.449
But how does he unify us?

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:22.210
If you're still there in Micah, turn over, please to chapter 4.

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:24.710
And here we identify in the first verse.

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:30.009
It says in the final part of the day, so the time in which we live right now,

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:32.409
verse 2, many nations will go and say,

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:38.110
come, let us go up to the mountain of Jehovah and to the house of the God of Jacob.

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.810
He will instruct us about his ways.

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.610
Yes, divine education is involved, instruction.

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:51.110
He will instruct us about his ways and we will walk in his paths.

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.310
So applying what we learn is a requisite as well.

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:55.409
And what result?

00:02:55.409 --> 00:03:01.710
Notice in verse 3, they will beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning shears.

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:07.409
Nation will not lift up sword against nation, nor will they learn war anymore.

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:11.110
We are sharing in the fulfillment of these words right now.

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:15.610
In a time when the nations and even individuals are armed to the teeth,

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:24.710
Jehovah's people refuse to learn war, education and application.

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:28.909
And Jehovah willingly instructs people of all nations.

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:34.610
He doesn't close the borders of the pen of his spiritual nation to certain nationalities.

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:43.110
No, Jehovah unites in the pen individuals from any nation who are willing to conform to his standards.

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:48.509
The peace and unity we experience among Jehovah's people is a modern-day miracle.

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:50.110
Do we appreciate it?

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.909
Consider just two examples.

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:58.610
Lothar from Germany, which incidentally I understand Lothar means famous warrior,

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.110
he had been part of the German Hitler youth.

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:08.210
And Herbert from Britain, which I understand Herbert means illustrious warrior,

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:11.210
had been in the British Royal Air Force.

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:17.009
They were fed propaganda by this world and were enemies during World War II.

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:20.009
But then Jehovah educated them.

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:22.509
And they were baptized as his witnesses.

00:04:22.509 --> 00:04:24.709
They put into practice the things that they learned.

00:04:24.709 --> 00:04:30.009
Later as missionaries in Venezuela, they worked together to teach people how to live at peace.

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.910
First of all with God and then with one another.

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:40.709
Lothar and Herbert were even roommates for a while according to the 96-year book.

00:04:40.709 --> 00:04:45.110
Another man we'll call Robert was from a staunchly Protestant family

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:52.009
and joined the British army at 19 years of age and was assigned to Northern Ireland.

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:56.610
A woman we'll call Teresa on the other hand was from a Catholic background

00:04:56.709 --> 00:05:01.209
and she joined the local political party Shin Fein as a young girl.

00:05:01.209 --> 00:05:06.610
She kept the Irish Republican army, the IRA, informed about what was happening in her area.

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:13.910
Well, eventually both Robert and Teresa began learning Bible truth from Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:17.509
Later they met at a congregation meeting in Northern Ireland.

00:05:17.509 --> 00:05:24.509
Teresa said, when I first met Robert, I found it difficult to believe that I was talking so calmly and peacefully

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:29.410
with someone whom I would have considered part of the British war machine.

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:37.110
God's word has certainly helped me to remove deep-seated hatreds and prejudices.

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:41.709
She and Robert now found that they had many things in common.

00:05:41.709 --> 00:05:44.110
They got married.

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:50.610
Lothar and Herbert, Robert and Teresa, many others have beaten their swords into plough shares

00:05:50.709 --> 00:05:52.709
and their spears into pruning shears.

00:05:52.709 --> 00:05:58.709
Only Jehovah can accomplish that with his powerful Holy Spirit.

00:05:58.709 --> 00:06:05.709
Yet why might maintaining Christian unity be a challenge for us at times?

00:06:05.709 --> 00:06:07.509
Let's look at today's scripture texts.

00:06:07.509 --> 00:06:11.310
If we turn over to John chapter 10 now,

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:14.110
John chapter 10 verse 16,

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:17.709
and these are Jesus' words, the head of the Christian congregation, the fine shepherd.

00:06:17.709 --> 00:06:19.110
Notice what he says.

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:24.110
John 10 16, and I have other sheep which are not of this fold.

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:35.110
Those two, I must bring in and they will listen to my voice and they will become one flock, one shepherd.

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:42.610
So the challenge is not just the sheer volume of sheep that Jesus has gathered into the flock,

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:46.810
but the fact that we have so many different backgrounds as well.

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:49.509
Think for a moment about literal sheep.

00:06:49.509 --> 00:06:52.810
How many different types of sheep are there?

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:55.810
Now this was news to me as I was preparing for this part,

00:06:55.810 --> 00:07:03.310
but most sources indicate that there are over 200 distinct breeds of sheep from all over the world.

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:09.310
Just to name a few, there are Scottish blackface, whiteface woodland,

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:17.310
blueface lester, California red, Barbados blackbelly, and Wiltshire horn sheep.

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:22.310
Each type of sheep has different characteristics, some are known for their wool,

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:25.810
others are known for their meat, or even for their milk,

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:31.310
and sheep have different temperaments, some are more docile than others.

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:36.310
But not one type of sheep has all of the desirable characteristics.

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:39.310
What a fitting illustration that Jesus used.

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:43.310
This one united flock of precious sheep comes from where?

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:49.310
It comes from over 230 different lands around the earth, out of all nations, tribes, peoples and tongues.

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:55.310
We all have strength, we all have weaknesses, so it takes work to remain united.

00:07:55.310 --> 00:08:02.310
And what is the key? What did we discuss? Education? Application.

00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:07.310
And what did Jesus say? The sheep would do his other sheep.

00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:12.310
All of those that are together, they will listen to my voice.

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:17.310
All of Jesus' sheep, the little flock and the other sheep alike, work hard to apply his teachings.

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:21.310
Consider just a few from Jesus' sermon on the Mount.

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:27.310
We try hard to make peace with our brother if we've offended him in some way.

00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:30.310
We try our best to love our enemies.

00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:33.309
We forgive others, their trespasses.

00:08:33.309 --> 00:08:39.309
We do our best to stop judging others who for their actions or for their motives.

00:08:39.309 --> 00:08:44.309
And fundamentally, we treat others as we would like them to treat us.

00:08:44.309 --> 00:08:49.309
Because of our rich diet of spiritual food, we produce peaceful qualities, peaceful fruit.

00:08:49.309 --> 00:08:53.309
Education and application leads to peace.

00:08:54.309 --> 00:08:57.309
With what result? What did Jesus say?

00:08:57.309 --> 00:09:00.309
We become one flock, one shepherd.

00:09:00.309 --> 00:09:02.309
We enjoy precious unity as a group.

00:09:02.309 --> 00:09:08.309
But what about us as individuals in our work environment or in our daily activities?

00:09:08.309 --> 00:09:09.309
What's our responsibility?

00:09:09.309 --> 00:09:16.309
No, please, how the Apostle Paul highlighted the qualities that we continually need to cultivate.

00:09:16.309 --> 00:09:18.309
Ephesians chapter four.

00:09:18.309 --> 00:09:21.309
And notice, please, verses one through three.

00:09:21.309 --> 00:09:25.309
Ephesians four, one through three, the Apostle Paul wrote,

00:09:25.309 --> 00:09:32.309
therefore, either prisoner in the Lord appealed to you to walk worthyly of the calling with which you were called,

00:09:32.309 --> 00:09:40.309
with all humility and mildness with patience.

00:09:40.309 --> 00:09:50.309
Putting up with one another in love, earnestly endeavoring to maintain the oneness of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace.

00:09:50.309 --> 00:09:55.309
So what qualities are not produced in the spiritual paradise?

00:09:55.309 --> 00:09:58.309
What did you not see in these verses?

00:09:58.309 --> 00:10:06.309
Well, pride, stubbornness, independent thinking, they don't exist in the spiritual paradise.

00:10:06.309 --> 00:10:13.309
If we detect any of these weeds growing in us, then we want to root them out with the help of Jehovah's Holy Spirit.

00:10:13.309 --> 00:10:16.309
But what qualities do grow in the spiritual paradise?

00:10:16.309 --> 00:10:24.309
Notice, as Paul said, humility, mildness, patience, forgiveness.

00:10:24.309 --> 00:10:27.309
These contribute to the uniting bond of peace.

00:10:27.309 --> 00:10:29.309
It takes earnest effort.

00:10:29.309 --> 00:10:31.309
We earnestly need to apply ourselves.

00:10:31.309 --> 00:10:34.309
But Jehovah blesses our efforts to display such qualities.

00:10:34.309 --> 00:10:37.309
So what have we considered this morning?

00:10:37.309 --> 00:10:43.309
Although the world continues to become more and more divided, Jehovah's people become more and more united.

00:10:43.309 --> 00:10:45.309
Jehovah unifies his people.

00:10:45.309 --> 00:10:48.309
He teaches us how to live together in peace.

00:10:48.309 --> 00:10:54.309
And we strive to cultivate qualities that will strengthen our Christian unity.

00:10:54.309 --> 00:11:01.309
So as we interact with one another today, may Jehovah's Spirit guide our thoughts and actions.

00:11:01.309 --> 00:11:06.309
Move us to reside with one another in peace and unity.
