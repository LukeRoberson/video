WEBVTT

00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.129
Welcome, dear brothers and sisters.

00:00:05.129 --> 00:00:14.050
In this program, it's my pleasure to share reports about our in-person activities.

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:19.370
We'll also provide updates about our disaster relief efforts.

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:27.850
And finally, in view of the rapidly changing world scene, we'll discuss the need for decisive

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:34.929
action when we're confronted with dangerous circumstances.

00:00:34.929 --> 00:00:43.890
Since September 1, 2022, we've resumed the House to House Ministry.

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:52.530
And we also had a worldwide campaign to offer Bible studies using the Enjoy Life Forever

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.969
brochure.

00:00:54.969 --> 00:01:04.049
Many honest-hearted ones are responding to this good news of something better.

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:11.329
Since our last update, it was announced that as of October 1, we are no longer strongly

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:17.609
recommending mask-wearing while attending in-person meetings.

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:24.170
So unless it's a governmental requirement, it is a personal choice whether to wear a

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.769
mask while participating in theocratic activities.

00:01:29.769 --> 00:01:38.010
We respect the individual decisions of our brothers and sisters on this matter.

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:47.010
This direction will also apply to our in-person theocratic schools, circuit assemblies, and

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:53.969
regional conventions when they resume in 2023.

00:01:53.969 --> 00:02:04.650
By January 1, 2023, if it is Jehovah's will, we hope to have returned to most of our pre-pandemic

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:11.849
arrangements in harmony with local governmental regulations.

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:19.569
There are some activities that have not yet been approved to resume, such as Bethel Tours

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:22.129
and guests.

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:25.930
But what about beyond January 1?

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:36.129
We're excited to inform you that Jehovah willinging will resume in-person special conventions

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:41.770
starting January 1, 2024.

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:49.810
Your information on the specific locations and dates will be announced soon.

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:57.270
We're very happy to share these positive developments with you.

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:07.069
During the pandemic, tragically, many of us have lost loved ones to COVID-19.

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:12.949
Sadly, others have lost loved ones because of war.

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:18.430
Natural disasters are other painful circumstances.

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:26.270
In recent times, likely you've shared the Bible's message of comfort with a coworker,

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:30.389
a neighbor, or a relative.

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:40.270
To help us in such situations, we're pleased to announce the release of our new video.

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:46.710
It is entitled Comfort for those who mourn.

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:54.509
We're confident that this video will be a valuable tool to help us comfort our relatives

00:03:54.550 --> 00:04:02.430
and other acquaintances, even those who may not be religiously inclined.

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:10.509
Please enjoy watching this comforting video.

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:15.469
Our family and friends are precious to us.

00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:18.699
They show us love.

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:22.639
They are there when we need them.

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:32.899
So when we lose a loved one in death, we want comfort from someone who understands

00:04:32.899 --> 00:04:38.620
God and his son, Jesus, understand.

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:45.620
While on Earth, Jesus experienced the pain of losing family and friends.

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:52.139
After the death of a close friend named Lazarus, Jesus' grief was intense.

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:56.550
He felt what others felt.

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:03.790
The pain was crushing, yet his empathy moved him to comfort others.

00:05:03.829 --> 00:05:07.750
Still, he wanted to do more.

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:14.290
Jesus spoke with his father and brought his friend back to life.

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:18.649
Jehovah God and Jesus have not changed.

00:05:18.649 --> 00:05:22.250
They feel pain when people die.

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:28.250
They feel your pain and have promised to eliminate death.

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:31.009
God will swallow up death forever.

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:36.170
Jehovah will wipe away the tears from all faces.

00:05:36.209 --> 00:05:40.889
Jesus also gave this beautiful promise for the future.

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:43.050
Do not be amazed at this.

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:50.889
For the hour is coming in which all those in the memorial tombs will hear his voice and come out.

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:58.050
A special magazine entitled Help for those who grieve has been prepared to provide comfort.

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:02.569
You can download your copy free of charge on JW.org.

00:06:02.569 --> 00:06:12.980
We are sorry for your loss and hope that this message will provide you comfort during this difficult time.

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:20.620
This video is now available on JW.org and in JW Library.

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:32.740
You can find it under what's new and also under videos, our meetings and ministry, tools for the ministry.

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:44.060
In order for you to have easy access to this video in JW Library, you may choose to add it to your favorites.

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:50.339
We also have some updates about our disaster relief efforts.

00:06:50.339 --> 00:07:00.939
As reported on JW News, Hurricanes Fiona and Ian have affected our brothers and sisters in the Caribbean

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:04.860
and in parts of Canada and the United States.

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:10.980
Sadly, one brother in Cuba died.

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:24.779
Between the two storms, over 3,600 of our brothers' homes in over a hundred Kingdom Halls were damaged or destroyed.

00:07:24.779 --> 00:07:32.139
The branch offices are working hard to provide assistance and spiritual encouragement.

00:07:32.139 --> 00:07:44.170
We continue to pray for all those affected by natural disasters and for all those who are providing relief.

00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:51.569
You may also be wondering, how are our brothers in Ukraine and Russia doing?

00:07:51.610 --> 00:08:03.410
Since February, over 26,000 brothers and sisters have chosen the flea areas affected by the war in Ukraine.

00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:09.689
Because of recent events, thousands of people are fleeing Russia.

00:08:09.689 --> 00:08:13.370
This includes some of our brothers.

00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:24.850
At the outset, some thought the war might last for only a few weeks or months, but this is not the case.

00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:40.169
If you have fled the war to another country, please know that we want to help you to regain a sense of normalcy in your lives as soon as possible.

00:08:40.169 --> 00:08:43.450
What are we doing to assist?

00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:50.529
Well, let's watch the following report from the Central Europe branch.

00:08:50.529 --> 00:08:56.769
In our branch territory, over 8,500 brothers and sisters arrived as refugees.

00:08:56.769 --> 00:09:04.690
In March, the coordinators committee directed that we appoint case monitors to work under the direction of disaster relief committees.

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:14.610
Case monitors work along with elders to help individuals and families to maintain their spiritual routine and become self-sufficient.

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:21.289
Some publishers have been able to make personal arrangements to obtain accommodations and employment.

00:09:21.289 --> 00:09:25.250
Others have been able to benefit from government programs.

00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:31.049
We have found that the sooner we can help our brothers to get settled into their own home,

00:09:31.049 --> 00:09:38.730
to find employment, and to associate with a local congregation, the sooner they feel a sense of normalcy.

00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:44.009
This benefits them spiritually, physically, and emotionally.

00:09:44.009 --> 00:09:47.730
Jehovah is really blessing these efforts.

00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:53.450
Recently, a system made an appointment for a refugee family to view an apartment.

00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:57.809
A few local brothers and a translator accompanied the family.

00:09:57.850 --> 00:10:00.330
The real estate agent was impressed.

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:04.690
He said, never before has anyone been so professional.

00:10:04.690 --> 00:10:09.250
I am more than thrilled with your religious community.

00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:15.049
At the end of the visit, the family from Ukraine asked the agent if they would get the apartment.

00:10:15.049 --> 00:10:21.690
The agent showed them his calendar and said that he had 10 other applicants for the same place.

00:10:21.730 --> 00:10:25.409
Then he thought about it for a moment and said with a smile,

00:10:25.409 --> 00:10:28.370
you are doing such a great work.

00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:32.289
I would like to contribute my part and do something good.

00:10:32.289 --> 00:10:35.210
You get the apartment.

00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:39.889
Afterward, the agent asked more about Jehovah's Witnesses and our work.

00:10:39.889 --> 00:10:43.850
He then assured our brother that he would help us in the future.

00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:47.570
He explained that whenever an apartment opens up,

00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:52.690
he would let the brothers know first and they could arrange to view it.

00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:57.529
The agent is also helping with the paperwork so that the refugees can benefit

00:10:57.529 --> 00:11:02.049
from available government assistance which covers the rental costs.

00:11:02.049 --> 00:11:06.049
What a blessing for all involved.

00:11:06.049 --> 00:11:11.289
It's encouraging to hear how so many are working hard

00:11:11.289 --> 00:11:17.730
to help our refugee brothers get back to a more normal life.

00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:23.730
And we're so proud of our refugee brothers for being flexible

00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:28.610
and for having realistic expectations.

00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:33.289
We are also working to assist various branch offices around the world,

00:11:33.289 --> 00:11:41.250
especially in Europe, to be better equipped to deal with potential energy shortages.

00:11:42.049 --> 00:11:51.250
This may be in the form of adding solar panels, generators, and battery backups.

00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:57.769
This will help branches to continue their vital work of delivering spiritual food

00:11:57.769 --> 00:12:05.629
and giving support and direction to congregation activities.

00:12:05.629 --> 00:12:10.590
But now for the next few minutes, let's discuss the theme.

00:12:10.629 --> 00:12:17.350
When you say danger, act quickly.

00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:24.470
No doubt you'd agree that the scene of this world is changing.

00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:29.070
The relative stability we've experienced in various parts of the world

00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:34.470
seems to be rapidly disappearing.

00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:38.190
There are so many natural disasters.

00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:48.629
Increased unrest, war, threats of food shortages, energy shortages, and more.

00:12:48.629 --> 00:12:55.789
What should we do when we are personally confronted with such dangers?

00:12:55.789 --> 00:13:01.269
Well, please turn with me to Proverbs chapter 22.

00:13:01.269 --> 00:13:05.590
And let's read together verse number three.

00:13:05.629 --> 00:13:13.070
The shrewd one sees the danger and conceals himself.

00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:21.750
But the inexperienced keep right on going and suffer the consequences.

00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:28.230
Yes, when we see danger, we're wise to conceal ourselves.

00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:31.309
But we must act quickly.

00:13:31.309 --> 00:13:35.789
This is true now, and it was true in Bible times too.

00:13:35.789 --> 00:13:38.629
Consider a few examples.

00:13:38.629 --> 00:13:49.470
When David faced threats of attack from Saul or others, he quickly got up and ran away.

00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:57.590
In the first century, Jehovah's Angel told Joseph to take newborn Jesus and Mary

00:13:57.629 --> 00:14:02.470
and flee to Egypt because, quote,

00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:09.389
Herod is about to search for the young child to kill him.

00:14:09.389 --> 00:14:16.779
So Joseph and Mary left that night.

00:14:16.779 --> 00:14:25.259
Later, Jesus told Christians to flee when they saw Jerusalem surrounded by armies.

00:14:25.299 --> 00:14:29.620
Let's read that at Luke chapter 21.

00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:34.860
And we're going to read together verses 20 and 21.

00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:41.539
However, when you see Jerusalem surrounded by in-capped armies,

00:14:41.539 --> 00:14:47.860
then know that the desolating of her has drawn near.

00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:54.860
Then let those in Judea began fleeing to the mountains.

00:14:54.860 --> 00:15:06.019
Let those in the midst of her leave and let those in the countryside not enter into her.

00:15:06.019 --> 00:15:08.139
What's the point?

00:15:08.139 --> 00:15:17.340
When we see danger, we don't need to panic, but we do need to act quickly.

00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:23.340
That may mean fleeing the area where we live and saying goodbye to some

00:15:23.379 --> 00:15:27.659
or even all of our possessions.

00:15:27.659 --> 00:15:35.259
Many of our brothers and sisters in Ukraine and Russia are facing this question.

00:15:35.259 --> 00:15:40.019
Should I flee because of the war?

00:15:40.019 --> 00:15:45.019
That can be a very difficult decision to make.

00:15:45.019 --> 00:15:51.580
Unless the government directs us to flee, it's a personal decision.

00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:57.860
We do not expect Jesus or an angel to tell us to leave.

00:15:57.860 --> 00:16:03.500
But Jehovah does expect us to use our power of reason.

00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:07.980
He wants us to act wisely.

00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:20.740
Let's see how one family from Ukraine responded when they realized they were in danger.

00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:26.139
Even before the war started, there had been warnings.

00:16:26.139 --> 00:16:31.860
We had family worship and studied an article from the Awake magazine.

00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:38.500
There was a lot of advice about emergency kits and to have a plan of what you will do,

00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:45.539
we made a firm decision that if war broke out and there were explosions, we would not stay.

00:16:45.539 --> 00:16:49.100
Each one of us had our own emergency kit ready.

00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:52.740
We had put them in the hallway before everything started.

00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:58.500
I told the children, aside from your backpack, take only what you really need.

00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:03.179
Each child took only one extra change of clothes, and that's it.

00:17:03.179 --> 00:17:06.180
And we had filled up the tank in the car.

00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:10.259
Up to that moment, before the war, we had never had a full tank.

00:17:10.259 --> 00:17:14.220
We thought, let there never be war, but at least we'll have a full tank.

00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:16.740
We were ready and waiting, but what next?

00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:18.980
Was it safe to go or not?

00:17:19.019 --> 00:17:22.779
The elders called and told me to weigh up the pros and cons.

00:17:22.779 --> 00:17:25.539
Then there was an explosion.

00:17:25.539 --> 00:17:31.940
The windows in the doors shook, and I thought, no, we have to leave, that will be safer.

00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:38.299
So the whole family, me, my wife and five children, took our backpacks to the car.

00:17:38.299 --> 00:17:42.220
It took us just a few minutes to get the car ready.

00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:48.500
And when we were leaving, all the gas stations were crowded, and there were huge queues.

00:17:48.539 --> 00:17:53.539
Our tank was full, so we only had to fill up again near the border.

00:17:53.539 --> 00:17:56.740
We were at the border for 21 hours.

00:17:56.740 --> 00:18:01.019
It took 21 hours moving the car little by little.

00:18:01.019 --> 00:18:06.259
Time and again, we are convinced that Jehovah's advice is always for the best.

00:18:06.259 --> 00:18:11.259
Even if we don't understand why, we should follow it, always.

00:18:11.259 --> 00:18:13.700
And that obedience brings blessings.

00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:26.329
That's how it works.

00:18:26.369 --> 00:18:36.369
Being prepared allowed them to make the personal decision to leave quickly when they saw the danger.

00:18:36.369 --> 00:18:47.579
Ahead of time, they obediently followed the direction to have go bags and a full tank of gas in the car.

00:18:47.579 --> 00:18:53.660
Dear brothers and sisters, because of the instability of the world,

00:18:53.660 --> 00:19:01.180
we have to be prepared mentally, physically, and spiritually for disasters

00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:05.380
and rapidly changing circumstances.

00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:14.819
Today is affecting the East Brothers, but tomorrow it may be affecting us.

00:19:14.819 --> 00:19:21.339
But we can be sure that we will all stand together and help one another

00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:25.500
through whatever challenges we may face.

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:30.619
This is a time for us to support one another.

00:19:30.619 --> 00:19:37.940
And really, relief work is a vital part of our sacred service.

00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:42.539
Please turn with me to Acts chapter 11.

00:19:42.539 --> 00:19:48.700
And we're going to take a look at verses 28 and 29.

00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:54.819
One of them, named Agabas, stood up and foretold through the Spirit

00:19:54.819 --> 00:20:01.980
that a great famine was about to come on the entire inhabited earth,

00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:06.579
which in fact did take place in the time of Claudius.

00:20:06.579 --> 00:20:12.220
So the disciples determined each, according to what he could afford,

00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:19.109
to send relief to the brothers living in Judea.

00:20:19.109 --> 00:20:27.829
The study note on verse 29 helps us appreciate that this is the first recorded instance

00:20:27.829 --> 00:20:35.670
of Christian sending relief aid to fellow Christians living in another part of the world.

00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:39.190
The study note goes on to explain.

00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:45.309
The Greek word, diaconia, often rendered ministry,

00:20:45.309 --> 00:20:54.190
is also used in the sense of relief work at Acts 12.25 and relief ministry

00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:57.069
at 2 Corinthians 8.4.

00:20:57.069 --> 00:21:02.869
The use of the Greek word, diaconia, in the Christian Greek scriptures,

00:21:02.869 --> 00:21:08.349
shows that Christians have a twofold ministry.

00:21:08.349 --> 00:21:12.789
One aspect is the preaching and teaching work.

00:21:12.789 --> 00:21:20.710
The other aspect involves their ministry in behalf of fellow believers, as mentioned here.

00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:30.230
Paul showed that these different aspects of the Christian ministry all constitute sacred service.

00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:36.470
So we see that relief work is sacred service.

00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:42.109
It is a vital part of our ministry.

00:21:42.109 --> 00:21:51.190
We often say thank you, but we want you to know how very much we appreciate

00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:56.109
that you are generously supporting our relief efforts.

00:21:56.109 --> 00:22:01.710
You're providing food and rebuilding homes in Kingdom Halls.

00:22:01.710 --> 00:22:10.390
When refugees come, you're welcoming them at border crossings and into your homes.

00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:19.109
You're helping our brothers rebuild their lives and provide to them what they need.

00:22:19.109 --> 00:22:26.349
All of this is greatly needed and deeply appreciated.

00:22:26.349 --> 00:22:37.390
Thank you for what you're doing, and please know that we love you all very much.

00:22:37.390 --> 00:22:46.390
