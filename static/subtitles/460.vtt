00:00:01.389 --> 00:00:04.309
So when reading today's text,

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:07.309
maybe two questions came to your mind.

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:11.429
The one is, what are these body members on the earth?

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.190
And the other one is, how do we deaden our body members?

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:19.589
Our text reminds us of the words of Jesus,

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:22.910
where he said, it is better to cut off your hand,

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.350
your foot, to throw your eye away,

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.390
rather than being destroyed.

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:33.270
In Bible language, the hand, the foot, the eye,

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.109
often is used to illustrate what we do with our life.

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.750
The hand represents things we do or make with our hands.

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.630
The foot represents walking or running,

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:52.070
often connecting it with where we go in life.

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.310
The eye represents a viewpoint or opinion,

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.149
how we look at things, whether we like them or not.

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.670
So what do the body members mean?

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.469
They do not refer to literal parts of our body,

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:11.629
like the hand, the foot or the eye.

00:01:11.629 --> 00:01:16.629
It illustrates tendencies as imperfect people.

00:01:17.069 --> 00:01:20.349
In our text for today in Colossians 3 verse 5,

00:01:20.349 --> 00:01:23.349
Paul lists some of these tendencies.

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.909
He said, they are immorality and cleanness,

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.109
uncontrolled passion, hurtful desire.

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:35.109
Some translation say evil desires and greediness.

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:40.829
The bad inclinations we have within us, we have from birth.

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:46.469
Greed and bad desires come quite easily to most of us.

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:50.709
If you put the ball on the table

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:53.430
that is not perfectly level,

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.989
the ball will roll down to the lower end.

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:02.909
All humans are born with that inclination to go down.

00:02:04.349 --> 00:02:09.270
So how do we deaden or stop our inclination

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.789
towards evil desires and greed?

00:02:12.789 --> 00:02:16.270
Simply remove them from our life.

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.750
But that is not so easy to do,

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.830
because that inclination is very strong.

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:28.710
So how can we stop our inclinations from starting to rolling?

00:02:30.669 --> 00:02:34.909
What we discuss five things that we can do

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:39.830
to keep that ball of wicked inclinations in place.

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:44.110
Number one, control our mind.

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.990
Jehovah gave us this wonderful tool,

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:49.430
powerful tool, our mind.

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.590
And we can keep our inclinations under control.

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.430
But how do we do that?

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.509
You're in Colossians chapter three, in verse two,

00:02:59.509 --> 00:03:04.509
it says, keep your minds fixed on the things above.

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:07.469
So when the mind wants to go with it,

00:03:07.469 --> 00:03:10.909
it should not immediately bring it under control.

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:14.629
Stop it from going where it is bad.

00:03:14.669 --> 00:03:17.629
We have a choice what we think about.

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:22.629
Don't allow that ball of wicked reasoning to start rolling.

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:25.270
Don't even think about it.

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:28.669
More time spent on thinking about something

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:32.669
means that it is much more likely that we will do it.

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:38.710
So the second one, control our emotions.

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:41.150
How do we do that?

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.229
Well, don't let our emotions control us.

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:48.830
See our imperfect inclinations, what they really are.

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:51.830
They're imperfect and they are selfish,

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:55.550
like naughty little children.

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:57.509
When we don't get our way,

00:03:57.509 --> 00:04:01.310
our emotions can become like a screaming child.

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.349
It wants something, it wants it now.

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:08.310
It does not understand reason.

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.069
And the good mother refuses to give in to the child.

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.430
Now, if we're not careful,

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:20.430
our emotions will take over screaming, blue murder,

00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:23.310
demanding that we get it now.

00:04:24.069 --> 00:04:32.209
Let's read your first Corinthians six, verse 12.

00:04:32.209 --> 00:04:35.209
And we'll read the second part of verse 12.

00:04:35.209 --> 00:04:37.889
All things are lawful for me,

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:42.889
but I will not let myself be controlled by anything.

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:49.810
Number three, to control our inclinations,

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:51.889
to keep that ball from rolling,

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:55.810
recognize the danger of greed.

00:04:56.649 --> 00:05:00.250
The last part of our text today in Colossians three, verse five,

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:04.649
says, and greediness, which is a dollar tree.

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:08.050
When we for prey to greed,

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:12.569
our desires become our master, our God.

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:14.889
And we surrender our will,

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:19.170
and we actually become idolaters, self-worshipers.

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:22.490
Now that does not mean that all desires are bad.

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:26.290
Jehovah opens his hand and satisfies the desire

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:28.129
of every living thing.

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:32.410
The difference between normal desire and greed

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:34.889
might be likened to the difference between

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:37.930
the small campfire that cooks food

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:43.740
and the blazing inferno that consumes a forest.

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:47.259
Number four, to control our inclinations,

00:05:47.259 --> 00:05:50.060
do not be naive.

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:54.500
Let us read your Proverbs 14, 15 and 16.

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:58.740
Proverbs chapter 14, 15 and 16.

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:02.740
The naive person believes every word,

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:07.259
but the shrewd one ponders each step.

00:06:07.259 --> 00:06:11.180
The wise one is cautious and turns away from evil,

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:17.579
but the stupid one is reckless and overconfident.

00:06:17.579 --> 00:06:19.660
Do not for a moment think,

00:06:20.939 --> 00:06:23.819
well, this is not going to happen to me.

00:06:23.819 --> 00:06:27.819
Don't be fooled by your own desires.

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:32.139
Greed can never be satisfied.

00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:35.180
It never says enough.

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:38.860
A brother who was addicted said this

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:42.019
about every time that he gave in.

00:06:42.019 --> 00:06:46.500
He said, I was drawn by a force so powerful

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:50.660
that I did not turn back until it was too late.

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:55.500
Once that ball starts rolling, very little can stop it.

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:00.220
Number five, to stop that inclination,

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:02.819
be honest with yourself.

00:07:04.019 --> 00:07:08.180
Let us read your Romans 7, 22 and 23.

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:11.540
Romans 7, 22 and 23.

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:16.180
It says, I really delight in the law of God,

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:18.939
according to the man I am within,

00:07:18.939 --> 00:07:23.779
but I see in my body another law warring

00:07:23.779 --> 00:07:26.139
against the law of my mind,

00:07:26.139 --> 00:07:28.339
and leading me captive to sin's law

00:07:28.379 --> 00:07:30.300
that is in my body.

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:33.139
So it speaks there about a war.

00:07:33.139 --> 00:07:35.220
This is war.

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:37.300
Paul was in this war.

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:39.899
We are in this war,

00:07:39.899 --> 00:07:42.699
and they will be painful injuries.

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:46.500
A soldier, for example,

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:49.860
may damage a limb badly during battle,

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:52.620
and it has to be amputated.

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:56.420
At some point, he has to accept the fact

00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:58.779
that he is going to lose a limb

00:07:58.779 --> 00:08:00.980
and agree for it to be cut off.

00:08:02.459 --> 00:08:05.660
Now, we're not talking about literally cutting off members,

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:10.740
but at some point, we need to face the facts.

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:14.860
We must agree in our heart

00:08:16.139 --> 00:08:19.500
that we will give up a habit or a custom

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:24.180
that we feel is as precious as a hand or a foot and an eye.

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:26.899
This is not a game.

00:08:26.899 --> 00:08:29.060
Life depends on this.

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:32.500
Two things, admit that we have a problem,

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:35.500
and number two, do whatever it takes

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:37.419
to root it out of our life.

00:08:38.659 --> 00:08:43.659
So in summary, yes, obey the command,

00:08:43.659 --> 00:08:47.220
dead in your body members.

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:50.539
The battleground is our own heart.

00:08:50.539 --> 00:08:54.980
If we discover an inclination that is bad,

00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:59.539
stop it immediately, cut it off, throw it away.

00:08:59.539 --> 00:09:01.500
No harm will come to us.

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:06.179
When we do this, we really begin to live.

00:09:06.179 --> 00:09:08.620
It is exactly as Osama says,

00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:13.620
and Psalm 63, your loyal love is better than life.
