00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:06.900
We have an announcement for the Bethel family regarding an agreement that has been reached

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:13.820
to sell the six buildings comprising the 117 Adams Street and 90 Sand Street complex in Brooklyn.

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:19.379
The primary purpose here was to produce Bible literature that would help people to come to

00:00:19.379 --> 00:00:24.820
Nogihova and to understand his will and purpose and become disciples of Christ.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.980
I would walk through the press room and it smelled of ink and paper.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.979
It was noisy, but it was wonderful for me.

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:40.979
117 Adams Street will always remain part of my life.

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:50.979
We've always said what we produced helped people to gain a relationship with Jehovah and others to maintain a relationship with Jehovah.

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:55.979
So that was the focus of everything we did here.

00:00:55.979 --> 00:01:01.979
117 was just buzzing, you know, with machines and people coming over the bridges and equipment

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:06.980
and it was just thrilling just to walk around there.

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:12.980
We had this building before on Concord Street, but it was nothing to compare with this building.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:14.980
117 was the apex.

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:16.980
It was places faded into oblivion.

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:21.980
We now had the state of the art in the 117 Adams Street building.

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:28.980
The presses were on some of the higher floors and then when they would produce the material for books,

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:31.980
they would go through a slide down to the next floor.

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.980
And then they would drop down and shipping down below and go out.

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:40.980
But as a work kept increasing, we had to get new roller represses for one time.

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:45.980
We had 40 roller represses. We were running them all the time.

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:51.980
And keeping in mind in the early days, all of the books for the world were printed here.

00:01:51.980 --> 00:02:02.980
The limitations now with space here in Brooklyn has required that we look for other places in order to print and acquire the necessary equipment

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:08.979
that technology now is producing in order to get the work done.

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:14.979
The funds that we derive from the sale of the buildings allow us to be able to move the work ahead right now.

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:26.979
Now when you think of our JW.org, as far as the exposure of the truth to millions of people, much greater than the few people that would pass by that physical building.

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:32.979
117 will always have these memories because of what was accomplished there.

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:37.979
When they were printing the truth book and they're a million behind the demand.

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:43.979
The excitement, the things that took place there in those buildings, well that's enriching.

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:48.979
God's people have never been sentimental being attached to something material.

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:52.979
And now we need to move on. We've always been willing to do that.

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:59.979
What they did resulted in a tremendous worldwide witness. People know about Jehovah's Witnesses now.

00:02:59.979 --> 00:03:04.979
117 Adam Street has been a tool in Jehovah's Hand.
