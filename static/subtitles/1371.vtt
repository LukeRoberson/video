00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:06.940
An exciting event took place in 2017 across the United States.

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:12.939
August 21, 2017 has been on a lot of people's calendars for a long time because of the total eclipse.

00:00:12.939 --> 00:00:19.940
As Jehovah's Witnesses, we are constantly on the lookout for events where we can support community outreach.

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:25.940
Brothers and Sisters prepared well in advance to give a Bible education to the many travelers.

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:30.940
What convinced us that this was an opportunity to give a great witness was we did a little research.

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:33.939
And we noticed the hotel bookings.

00:00:33.939 --> 00:00:35.939
The town was packed.

00:00:35.939 --> 00:00:38.939
So we could tell this was going to be a big event.

00:00:38.939 --> 00:00:40.939
We needed to do something.

00:00:40.939 --> 00:00:45.939
We wanted to be in a position to share the wonderful things from the Bible with them.

00:00:45.939 --> 00:00:47.939
We need to take a global approach.

00:00:47.939 --> 00:00:51.939
We had to identify all the resources in band, not just to it by an individual congregation.

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:56.939
So in our campaign, we decided to feature three primary tools.

00:00:56.939 --> 00:00:58.939
First, what does the Bible really teach?

00:00:58.939 --> 00:01:00.939
Because many people wonder.

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:04.939
Second, was life created with an eclipse event.

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:06.939
People are thinking about the universe.

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:09.939
It's a good opportunity to talk about our creator.

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:17.939
And thirdly, jdm.org, since we expect a lot of visitors from all over the world, we could reach them in their language.

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:26.939
Over 200 brothers and sisters attended two seminars put on by local brothers to help prepare individuals for the massive campaign.

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:35.939
We had examples of what not to do and what to do so as to benefit as many people as possible.

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.939
We had an interview.

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.939
We had demonstrations on how to speak to people in different languages.

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:47.939
We're expecting people from many different parts of the world.

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.939
It's actually an opportunity to be like a missionary in our own hometown.

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:58.939
Some of the estimates that we have heard are conservative estimates of probably 200,000 visitors.

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:00.939
It may be more than that.

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:08.939
The local congregations made themselves available to work with city officials to prepare the parks for the large influx of people.

00:02:08.939 --> 00:02:13.939
So many of Jehovah's Witnesses have volunteered to help in all kinds of things.

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:18.939
These are really small communities that are having a very large influx of people.

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:24.939
All of that extra effort and help in kind of preparing and cleaning up is much appreciated.

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:29.939
We've had been working with Jehovah's Witnesses for a period of years here at Smith Rock.

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:32.939
It's been a good experience for our staff and our volunteers.

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:35.939
We want to accommodate that anyway we can.

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:38.939
There's been a lot of good things happening with cart witnessing.

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:42.939
One of the friends had a nice experience with an Arabic-speaking man.

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:46.939
But she said the seminar is what helped her to be prepared.

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:50.939
She knew how to work the app, how to find the video in the language.

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:53.939
She already had it downloaded and ready to go.

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:56.939
Paul spoke about his ministry.

00:02:56.939 --> 00:02:59.939
He said, well, it's me if I did not declare the good news.

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:03.939
So we don't want to look back in which we would have done more.

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:07.939
Trying it for the first time, it can be scary, it can be nerve-wracking.

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:10.939
But it's not so scary after you get started.

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:14.939
What's really been fun is what we are calling roving.

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:19.939
We go into an area where there's a lot of people and we just start conversations.

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:21.939
We don't carry any literature.

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:26.939
We just have our device and the JW.org contact cart.

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:29.939
And then hopefully, if the opportunity resents itself,

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:34.939
we may share them a video or tell them where Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:38.939
It's just been a paradise for them, preaching paradise to all these visitors coming in.

00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:43.939
We may not see the results of the seed that was planted when they take a look at our cart.

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:48.939
But Jehovah knows and the angels know and can make that role.

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:53.939
This endeavor has really helped me to appreciate the need to be alert,

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:56.939
to ways to expand our ministry.

00:03:56.939 --> 00:03:59.939
Most communities have a calendar of events.

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:06.939
Have we thought about looking at it and then make plans to give a witness by having our literature carts out.

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:12.939
In really events like this, they have a bigger impact on us as Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:16.939
Because we have an opportunity to talk, we get excited about our work,

00:04:16.939 --> 00:04:19.939
we're all working together shoulder to shoulder.

00:04:19.939 --> 00:04:21.939
It really builds our faith.

00:04:21.939 --> 00:04:24.939
Recently, a scripture that stood out to me was first Chronicles,

00:04:24.939 --> 00:04:27.939
chapter 28, verse 20, where it says,

00:04:27.939 --> 00:04:30.939
be courageous and go to work.

00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:34.939
Help me to realize I just need to take initiative and try.

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:36.939
That's what we all need to do.

00:04:36.939 --> 00:04:40.939
And then let Jehovah decide how things turn out.

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:45.939
Jehovah will no doubt less your efforts as you show an interest in others.
