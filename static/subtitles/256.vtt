00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:12.330
The ministerial training school, or MTS, as we often refer to it, is a school to give

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.210
single brothers who have served as elders or ministerial servants for at least two years.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.690
For example, a young brother can apply for Bethel when he becomes 19 years of age.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:28.089
But to apply for the MTS, he must be at least 23 years of age.

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:32.850
So he's had more experience, more background, and thus the additional training will qualify

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.530
him to take on more and more responsibilities in the organization.

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.689
Well, I was able to begin regular pioneering when I was 15 years old.

00:00:40.689 --> 00:00:44.009
I really appreciated and loved the field ministry.

00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:48.850
So my goal as a young person was to attend ministerial training school.

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:54.929
I applied to MTS when I was 21, and I applied to MTS when I was 22.

00:00:54.929 --> 00:01:01.170
Then I applied one more time when I was 23, and I was accepted to the 65th class of ministerial

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.129
training school in the fall of 2002.

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.689
In just two months of classroom instruction, I feel that I received years and years of

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:12.170
spiritual growth.

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.650
And those eight weeks of school, I truly became a different person.

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.769
And I think all my classmates feel the same way.

00:01:19.769 --> 00:01:26.290
Those two months create a strong bond of friendships between us that will have our whole life.

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.489
It'll be interesting to see where all of us are at and how we're benefiting and assisting

00:01:30.489 --> 00:01:35.769
the organization a year from now, ten years from now, and hopefully forever.

00:01:35.769 --> 00:01:40.969
Well, I was raised in the truth, and I'm very grateful to my parents for that.

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:46.329
I exiled pioneered for some time, but really knew I could do more for Jehovah.

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:51.730
So I began to regular pioneer, and at 22 years of age, a good friend of mine invited

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:55.170
me to help out any Portuguese-speaking group.

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.049
So I moved there and started to learn a foreign language.

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:04.129
Well, after there only a short while, the circuit overseer asked my partner and I, although

00:02:04.129 --> 00:02:08.729
with a limited knowledge of Portuguese still, to help out where there was a greater need

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:15.129
and a congregation that had only one elder, one ministeral servant, and one regular pioneer.

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:20.050
Little did I know at that time that branching out to learn a foreign language was going

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.729
to bring many blessings in the future.

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:28.289
So I stayed there in the Portuguese congregation for about five years until I was accepted

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.729
to the fourth class of the ministerial training school in 1989.

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:38.250
I was 27 when I attended the ministerial training school, and at the time I thought that,

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:44.370
well, I was a decent enough student of the Bible, but really the school taught me that we

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.289
need to dig deeper into the scriptures in order to follow principles and how to apply

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:52.050
them in many circumstances in life.

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:56.210
And one thing that really sticks out in my mind that we learned at the ministerial training

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:02.330
school was to imitate Jesus, imitate the way Jesus taught, imitate the way Jesus was

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:07.169
a shepherd, how he kindly cared for God's sheep, and certainly if we were to approach

00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:11.530
every situation of life and think, how would Jesus handle this?

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.729
It will help us be much more effective as shepherds and teachers.

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:19.409
Well, growing up in your home congregation, sometimes you take things for granted, but

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:25.969
the school really opened my eyes to organizational procedure and arrangements that had been invisible

00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:27.689
to me before.

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:34.650
It gave me a readjustment and a clarification of different ideas and attitudes and understandings

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.129
of things.

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:43.370
You really start to comprehend that Jehovah's organization is so important and to appreciate

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.610
any privilege that it extends to you.

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:53.530
If you really apply yourself, MTS is a great jump start to your usefulness to Jehovah and

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:54.689
to the Brotherhood.

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:58.969
The ministerial training school also taught me much about how to handle organizational

00:03:58.969 --> 00:04:04.969
matters, that if I was to have learned that on my own, would have taken me many years.

00:04:04.969 --> 00:04:11.449
In fact, in this regard, I really come to mind how the principal and first Corinthians,

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:16.490
chapter 4, verse 6, which is really stuck with me for many years, which says, do not go

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:18.529
beyond the things that are written.

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:23.209
For surely if we do, we often get ourselves into much trouble and we're much more successful

00:04:23.209 --> 00:04:28.129
in our counseling and our teaching if we follow what's written in the scriptures and in

00:04:28.129 --> 00:04:29.730
the Christian publications.

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:33.889
Well, after graduation, I was assigned back to my home congregation.

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:36.730
However, I could not believe it.

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:42.129
Just three weeks later, I was assigned to the Russian congregation in Pennsylvania.

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:48.170
Now, I had no prior exposure to the Russian language, but in a relatively short period of

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:53.370
time, I began to give parts at every meeting in the Russian language.

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:59.089
Now, it's only been a little over a year now, so I can't say that I'm fluent at all,

00:04:59.089 --> 00:05:03.529
but I usually understand what's being said to me and can communicate my thought to Russian

00:05:03.529 --> 00:05:06.129
householders and to the friends.

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:12.209
At graduation, I received a missionary assignment to the country of Swaziland, which is located

00:05:12.209 --> 00:05:13.810
in Africa.

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:19.930
And I was very excited to receive that assignment, but I must say I was a bit surprised, too.

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:23.930
It seemed strange because I had learned Portuguese and they don't speak Portuguese there in

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:25.810
Swaziland.

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:31.889
But after a year and a half serving there, the band had lifted on our work in Mozambique

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:36.370
and I was reassigned to Mozambique where they do speak Portuguese.

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:42.170
I served there in the missionary field as well as at Bethel and I enjoyed many wonderful

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:46.649
faith, strengthening, and sometimes adventurous experiences.

00:05:46.649 --> 00:05:52.089
And after serving nine years in Africa, I transferred back to the United States.

00:05:52.089 --> 00:05:57.610
I was pioneering and supported myself working as an interpreter for Portuguese.

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:03.290
But in 2000, I was appointed as a Circuit Overseer, which is my present assignment and I'm enjoying

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:08.889
it very much and Jehovah certainly has poured on many blessings in this regard.

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:13.930
We currently have an excellent ministerial training school graduate assigned to our congregation.

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:20.370
And these brothers are real gifts from Jehovah, single, enthusiastic, ready to do whatever's

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:22.050
asked of them.

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:27.689
They work hard to present high quality meeting parts and conscientiously care for all of

00:06:27.689 --> 00:06:29.730
their assigned duties.

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:35.610
They showed genuine personal interest in others and set an excellent example for young

00:06:35.689 --> 00:06:41.050
ones to focus on the ministry and to pursue spiritual goals.

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:46.009
It's like having a missionary assigned to the congregation, a modern-day Timothy.

00:06:46.009 --> 00:06:51.250
We dearly love these brothers and we really appreciate the significant part they play

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:54.089
in the theocratic history of our congregations.

00:06:54.089 --> 00:06:59.569
Yes, there are many privileges of service that the brothers in the organization can reach

00:06:59.569 --> 00:07:01.089
out for.

00:07:01.089 --> 00:07:07.170
But the ministerial training school is truly a one way to qualify a young man's

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:12.529
bureaucratic training to enable him to be given additional responsibility and to take

00:07:12.529 --> 00:07:15.889
on this responsibility at an earlier age.

00:07:15.889 --> 00:07:20.490
For example, one graduate of the ministerial training school who is now in the circuit

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:27.170
work expressed himself this way and I quote, attending the school served to expand my

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:29.610
view of the organization.

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:34.889
Obviously, I would have been content to spend my whole life in the comfort of my home

00:07:34.889 --> 00:07:41.170
congregation, serving with the host congregation where I went to school and with the other students

00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:47.529
prove that we have family and friends in the organization wherever we serve.

00:07:47.529 --> 00:07:53.009
Friendships formed in school are still among my dearest and this is repeated with each

00:07:53.009 --> 00:07:55.129
new assignment.

00:07:55.129 --> 00:08:01.370
I've personally seen hundreds of young men receive this training in the MTS.

00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:06.569
And as a result of the training, they like Timothy of old, they take good care of the

00:08:06.569 --> 00:08:12.129
brothers and sisters in the congregations where they are and they are sincere in working

00:08:12.129 --> 00:08:15.209
for the furtherance of the good news.

00:08:15.209 --> 00:08:19.170
So the school does not just teach Bible facts.

00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:25.009
It's helping these brothers to become a tour and those that see them take note that

00:08:25.009 --> 00:08:27.610
their advancement is manifest to one another.
