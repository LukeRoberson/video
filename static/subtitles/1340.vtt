00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:09.009
The modern day history of Jehovah's Witnesses in Greece includes a long record of legal

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:14.820
battles to establish the freedom to preach the good news.

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.379
However today, for the most part, opposition has subsided, and the Greece branch continues

00:00:20.379 --> 00:00:25.620
to spearhead the preaching work in Cyprus and in Greece.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.940
What led up to this branch dedication?

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:33.259
After a ten-year search for a suitable site for the new branch, and with help from the

00:00:33.259 --> 00:00:38.179
worldwide design construction department, a location was found.

00:00:38.179 --> 00:00:44.039
The new branch office is located on the outskirts of Athens, close to the busy port of

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:45.939
Perreus.

00:00:45.939 --> 00:00:48.820
What are the new offices like?

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:54.979
Let's start with the Translation Office, which was dedicated in October 2016.

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:59.820
The translation office is located on the second floor of this building, just above the

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.780
dotted line.

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.579
Most members of the translation team live in the apartments above the offices.

00:01:06.579 --> 00:01:15.299
Here, the brothers translate into Greek, Greek sign language, and two Romani languages.

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.219
The new branch office is located about three miles from the translation office.

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:25.310
It occupies one half of this new building.

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:31.150
A commercial firm put up the building structure, and a local design construction team customized

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.709
the inside for our needs.

00:01:34.709 --> 00:01:37.109
Here is a look at the new branch.

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:39.709
Here is the lobby.

00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:51.629
Here we see the rooms, some of the offices, and the dining room.

00:01:51.629 --> 00:01:58.790
The dedication of the beautiful new branch was scheduled for Saturday, November 17, 2018,

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.030
and things did not go as planned.

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:07.989
As Jamie and I left for the airport on Thursday morning, some light snow was expected, so we

00:02:07.989 --> 00:02:09.469
arrived early.

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:13.750
However, much more snow fell than was forecast.

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.150
Our flight was delayed, and eventually it was canceled.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:24.229
So after spending 14 hours at Newark Airport, we returned to Warwick.

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:28.629
We had to wait until the next evening to catch a flight.

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:33.629
The next day, the brothers in Greece were gathering in the Bethel dining room for the branch

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:40.430
dedication, but our late departure meant that we would not arrive in time for the program.

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.590
Kindly, the teaching committee adjusted the schedule so that the dedication talk could

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.110
be presented on Sunday.

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.509
But what took place in Greece when all the brothers found out we wouldn't make it in

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:55.710
time for the dedication talk on Saturday?

00:02:55.949 --> 00:03:00.870
I said to brother Cook, you know brother Cook, if there's anything you need help with,

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.710
I said please let me know.

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:17.270
Brother Le Franca gave an encouraging service talk that enhanced the weekend program.

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:26.539
We arrived at the branch late Saturday afternoon in time to greet the brothers there.

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:34.099
On Sunday morning we traveled to the assembly hall along with 116 delegates from 16 countries.

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:39.180
The attendance at the assembly hall was 1,680.

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:44.740
All the congregations in Greece and Cyprus were either tied in or watched the recorded

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:52.379
program, making the total attendance 27,718.

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:58.699
Do you desire to dedicate this branch office to Jehovah God to be used exclusively for

00:03:58.699 --> 00:04:14.710
his praise and glory and to promote his pure worship in your branch territory?

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:22.800
After the program in Greek style, all rejoiced in what Jehovah had done.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:30.920
The 84 Bethelites, 44 commuters and all in attendance at the assembly hall enthusiastically

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:37.240
sent their love and greetings to the governing body and the Bethel family in the United States.
