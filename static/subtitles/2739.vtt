00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:19.500
It was in 1845 that Joseph and Analyzer Russell emigrated from Ireland to Pennsylvania, USA.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.780
They would have five children, among them Charles Tays.

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:32.780
But times were hard, his brother Thomas died at age five.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:01:01.079
Before Charles turned nine, two more of his siblings died, then his mother died.

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:09.879
That same year, 1861, the United States became embroiled in a civil war that would send 618,000

00:01:09.879 --> 00:01:18.650
to their graves.

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:36.920
Thousands perished on battlefields not far from where the Russians lived and worked.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:43.640
They would be able to see firsthand the havoc that war wreaks on people, the suffering,

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.140
the death.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:55.069
Young Charles Russell thought often about what happens to the dead.

00:01:55.069 --> 00:02:01.069
Most religions held that God created man immortal, and that he made a fiery hell in which to

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:09.930
torment people forever, except those predestined for salvation.

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:15.840
Russell's feelings about such teachings came through and what he wrote.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:22.199
A God that would use his power to create human beings whom he forenew and predestinated

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:31.080
should be eternally tormented, could be neither wise, just, nor loving.

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.379
His standard would be lower than that of many men.

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:44.300
He could never reconcile the teaching of eternal torment with the description of the Bible

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.099
of a loving God.

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:51.900
As he examined the creeds of the great churches, when he saw that they taught that the wicked

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:58.300
or a tormented eternally, why he just could not accept that.

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:03.500
The whole culture, religious culture at that time was a matter of believing that God was

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:04.860
a God of vengeance.

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:11.340
And Russell knew that the Bible said, as it does at first John 4.8, God is love.

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.020
How could a God of love do this?

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.979
And so his faith wavered.

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:24.819
He felt he could do the most good for people through business and philanthropy.

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:31.259
As a preteen, he became his father's partner in a growing chain of clothing stores.

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:43.009
Charles Russell enlarged the business, eventually operating a number of stores by himself.

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:48.610
By age 25, he possessed over $300,000.

00:03:48.610 --> 00:04:10.090
The equivalent of $7 million today, yet his search for truth continued.

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:26.579
In 1869, something happened that would help reestablish his faith.

00:04:26.579 --> 00:04:32.939
Seemingly by accident one evening, I had dropped into a dusty dingy hall to see if the

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:38.259
handful who met there had anything more sensible to offer than the creeds of the great churches.

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:49.079
The words of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Himself, to the apostles.

00:04:49.079 --> 00:04:53.879
There for the first time, I heard something of the views of second Adventists from the

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:57.600
preacher, Mr. Jonas Wendell.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:05.079
Though his scripture exposition was not entirely clear, it was sufficient under God to reestablish

00:05:05.079 --> 00:05:09.279
my wavering faith in the divine inspiration of the Bible.

00:05:10.279 --> 00:05:15.439
Now remember at this point, Russell is not an atheist, but he is just discouraged.

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:22.240
He doesn't feel that truth can be found anywhere, and that, sermon by a second Adventist,

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:29.279
was enough to get him to get his well-worn Bible off the shelf and to start digging again.

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:33.079
As we've already seen, the word Trinity doesn't appear anywhere in the Bible.

00:05:33.079 --> 00:05:39.759
Fired with enthusiasm, Charles, his father Joseph, and a few acquaintances in Pittsburgh

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:43.800
and Allegheny, formed a class for Bible study.

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:49.480
They would take a subject, they would get a Bible concordance, they would look up every

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:54.519
single scripture that had a bearing on the subject, and then they would write down their

00:05:54.519 --> 00:06:00.439
conclusions, and then they would say, all right, this is what the Bible teaches, we are

00:06:00.439 --> 00:06:02.639
going to believe that.

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:09.439
After five years of study, the religious thinking of these men had undergone remarkable

00:06:09.439 --> 00:06:11.439
change.

00:06:11.439 --> 00:06:17.519
Their study of the Bible led them to major conclusions that challenged the prevailing religious views

00:06:17.519 --> 00:06:28.540
of the day. For example, while most religions taught that man has a soul, Russell and his associates

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:37.519
concluded that man is a soul, and that the soul can die, and whereas Christendom's churches

00:06:37.519 --> 00:06:44.240
teach that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost are one person, these students held

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:50.819
that Jehovah is one God, and not part of a Trinity.

00:06:50.819 --> 00:06:55.899
In addition, while some churches were teaching that Christ would return in the flesh, and

00:06:55.899 --> 00:07:01.699
that the earth would be destroyed, this small group came to understand that Christ would

00:07:01.699 --> 00:07:09.829
return invisibly in the spirit, with the purpose of blessing the obedient mankind.

00:07:09.829 --> 00:07:15.750
So it wasn't just philosophizing, just talking about what if, or perhaps this way, but they

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:21.870
were focused on trying to actually find the truth, and the fact that they decided to write

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:26.709
down those conclusions showed that they had a belief that there is some truth to be found.

00:07:26.709 --> 00:07:32.470
We only see light when it's Jehovah's time to reveal light.

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:38.790
And so this was the beginning of Jehovah's time to lead his people out of darkness into

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:39.870
the wonderful light.
