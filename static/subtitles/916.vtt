00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:18.030
Do you face ridicule, opposition, or persecution?

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:22.269
Are you trapped in a difficult situation in which there seems to be little you can do

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:25.469
to change your circumstances?

00:00:25.469 --> 00:00:29.030
If so, you are not alone.

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:34.869
The Bible tells us that David experienced these things, and David himself tells us how

00:00:34.869 --> 00:00:36.750
he coped.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:45.689
His words found at Psalm 62.5 are, I wait silently for God.

00:00:45.689 --> 00:00:51.009
Some scholars believe that David was 15 years old when he was anointed as King.

00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:57.770
If so, then he had to wait 22 years before he became King over all Israel.

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:03.570
During several of those years, King Saul chased after David, seeking to kill him.

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:10.090
As a result, David had to live as a fugitive, at times in caves in the wilderness, and

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:16.170
in other times in a foreign country among the enemies of Israel.

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.569
David learned patience.

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:22.609
The need to wait on Jehovah.

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:27.370
Let's consider three events that occurred during that period in his life.

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:33.370
First, happened in the wilderness of Ingeti, a place of rough mountains, honeycombed with

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:35.370
roomy caves.

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:42.370
King Saul consumed with envy and hatred, chased after David, intent on killing him.

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:46.170
David and his man hid from him in an immense cave.

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.170
They couldn't have been comfortable.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:49.769
They had no luxuries.

00:01:49.769 --> 00:01:54.090
They had to gather food, firewood, and water.

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.489
And they had to evade those who wanted them dead.

00:01:58.489 --> 00:02:03.890
But then came a surprising and unexpected situation.

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.489
Let's read about it.

00:02:05.489 --> 00:02:09.810
Please turn in your Bible to 1 Samuel 24.

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.250
Beginning with verse 2, I'll give you a moment to find it.

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:22.169
1 Samuel 24 will begin reading from verse 2.

00:02:22.169 --> 00:02:28.169
So Saul took 3,000 men, chosen from all Israel, and went to look for David and his men on

00:02:28.169 --> 00:02:36.979
the rocky cliffs of the mountain goats.

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:42.020
Saul came to the stone sheepfolds along the road, where there was a cave, and he went in

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.580
to relieve himself while David and his men were sitting in the recesses at the back of

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.889
the cave.

00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:51.090
David's men said to him,

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:57.849
This is the day on which Jehovah is saying to you, look, I am giving your enemy into

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:04.449
your hand, and you can do to him whatever seems good to you.

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:11.569
3,000 well chosen and highly trained soldiers were on the lookout for David.

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:18.889
Imagine the astonishment of David and his men when Saul himself, alone, and unprotected,

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:23.330
strolled into the very cave where they were hiding.

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:28.569
Saul's vision was adjusted to the light outside, so when he peered into the gloom of the cave,

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:31.610
he didn't see that there were men inside.

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:37.530
The men's eyes, however, were already accustomed to the dark, so they could see Saul clearly

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.650
against the light of the entrance.

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:47.129
Now Saul was vulnerable, completely in David's power.

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:50.090
Should David do away with him?

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:57.449
As men whispered for him to do just that, surely Jehovah was giving Saul into his hand.

00:03:57.449 --> 00:04:03.930
After all, it was God's will that David replaced Saul as king, and didn't David have good

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.370
reason to kill him?

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.330
Saul was out of control.

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:16.410
He had killed priests at knob, and wiped out the city, men, women, children, animals.

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:24.290
Saul because the high priest, a Himalach, had given David bread for his men to eat.

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:28.649
If David killed Saul, what would be the result?

00:04:28.649 --> 00:04:29.649
Deliverance?

00:04:29.649 --> 00:04:37.810
An ant was running as a fugitive, no more hiding in caves, the immediate kingship.

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:41.769
Surely all this passed through David's mind.

00:04:41.769 --> 00:04:43.410
What would he do?

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.370
What would you have done?

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:50.610
Let's continue reading from 1 Samuel 24 and verse 4.

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:57.649
So David rose up, and quietly cut off the edge of Saul's sleeveless coat.

00:04:57.649 --> 00:05:02.730
But afterward, David's heart kept striking him because he had cut off the edge of Saul's

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:04.529
sleeveless coat.

00:05:04.529 --> 00:05:06.050
He said to his men,

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:11.689
It is unthinkable from Jehovah's standpoint that I should do such a thing to my Lord,

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:20.689
the anointed of Jehovah by lifting my hand against him, for he is the anointed of Jehovah.

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:26.250
So David restrained his men with these words, and he did not allow them to attack Saul.

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:32.449
As for Saul, he rose up from the cave and went on his way.

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:35.850
David didn't listen to his men.

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:42.129
Instead, he took advantage of the situation to show that, wasn't a rebel, and that he

00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:46.850
didn't seek revenge for Saul's unfair and cruel treatment.

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:51.250
That took self-restraint.

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:53.850
It also required faith.

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:59.649
Faith that Jehovah would correct matters in his own time and way.

00:05:59.649 --> 00:06:05.449
His thinking is reflected not only in what he said to Saul, but also in what he wrote

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:07.610
in Psalm 57.

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:09.290
Verse 3 of that Psalm says,

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:14.290
Jehovah will send help from heaven and save me.

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:19.850
He will frustrate the one snapping at me.

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:25.850
We at times may find it difficult to exercise patience, especially when we're suffering

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:27.290
unjustly.

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:31.449
Often, we can do little to change things.

00:06:31.449 --> 00:06:35.569
But what if an easy way out presents itself?

00:06:35.569 --> 00:06:41.250
We should be like David, who first considered Jehovah's viewpoint.

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:47.689
Sometimes we should act, but sometimes it's best to wait for Jehovah to correct matters

00:06:47.689 --> 00:06:49.529
in his due time.

00:06:49.529 --> 00:06:52.290
Let's read what happened after Saul left the cave.

00:06:52.689 --> 00:06:57.290
We'll start from 1 Samuel 24 and verse 8.

00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:59.290
That's verse 8.

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:04.889
Then David got up and went out from the cave and called out after Saul.

00:07:04.889 --> 00:07:06.889
My Lord, the King!

00:07:06.889 --> 00:07:07.889
David?

00:07:07.889 --> 00:07:14.769
When Saul looked behind him, David bowed down low with his face to the ground and prostrated

00:07:14.769 --> 00:07:15.769
himself.

00:07:15.769 --> 00:07:17.769
David said to Saul,

00:07:17.769 --> 00:07:20.490
Why do you listen to the words of men who say,

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:23.930
Look, David is seeking to harm you.

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:30.449
This very day, your own eyes have seen how Jehovah gave you into my hand in the cave.

00:07:30.449 --> 00:07:34.810
But when someone said to kill you, I had pity on you and said,

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:41.769
I will not lift my hand against my Lord, for he is the anointed of Jehovah.

00:07:41.769 --> 00:07:46.769
And look, my Father, yes, see the edge of your sleeveless coat in my hand.

00:07:47.769 --> 00:07:52.449
When I cut off the edge of your sleeveless coat, I did not kill you.

00:07:52.449 --> 00:07:57.889
You can now see and understand that I do not intend to harm you or to rebel.

00:07:57.889 --> 00:08:04.410
And I have not sinned against you, whereas you are hunting me down to take my life.

00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:07.370
Major Jehovah judged between you and me.

00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:14.449
And Major Jehovah take vengeance on you for me, but my hand will not come against you.

00:08:14.449 --> 00:08:19.529
Just as the ancient proverb says, from the wicked comes wickedness.

00:08:19.529 --> 00:08:23.490
But my hand will not come against you.

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:27.209
After whom has the King of Israel gone out?

00:08:27.209 --> 00:08:28.889
Who are you chasing?

00:08:28.889 --> 00:08:30.529
A dead dog?

00:08:30.529 --> 00:08:32.570
A single flea?

00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:34.889
Major Jehovah be the judge.

00:08:34.889 --> 00:08:37.769
And he will judge between you and me.

00:08:37.769 --> 00:08:41.049
And he will see and will plead my case.

00:08:41.049 --> 00:08:46.730
And judge me and rescue me from your hand.

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:52.370
By showing restraint, David gave answer to those who had been telling Saul that David

00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:54.330
was seeking to harm him.

00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:57.370
He hadn't lifted his hand against Saul.

00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:58.370
Twice.

00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:02.929
He told Saul that it would be Jehovah who would judge between them.

00:09:02.929 --> 00:09:09.289
Though Saul was hunting him without cause, David did not speak abusively to Saul.

00:09:09.289 --> 00:09:15.250
He was respectful and humble as he told Saul he would wait for Jehovah to set things

00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:16.850
straight.

00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:21.649
What a powerful message that was to all who learned of the matter.

00:09:21.649 --> 00:09:26.769
Saul was stunned to learn that David had spared his life.

00:09:26.769 --> 00:09:31.370
And he called out to him, Jehovah will reward you with good because of what you have done

00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:33.009
for me today.

00:09:33.009 --> 00:09:40.090
I know that you will surely rule as king, and that in your hand the kingdom of Israel

00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:42.009
will endure.

00:09:42.009 --> 00:09:46.169
The Apostle Paul may have thought of this incident when he counseled Christians in Rome

00:09:46.169 --> 00:09:48.210
centuries later.

00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:50.690
Do not avenge yourselves.

00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:55.250
Keep conquering the evil with the good.

00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:59.610
Sometimes our good actions and speech can have a positive effect on those who oppose

00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:00.610
us.

00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:08.289
Saul was deeply moved by David's mercy, but would he stop seeking to kill him?

00:10:08.289 --> 00:10:10.289
We'll see.

00:10:10.289 --> 00:10:16.649
Because of our imperfection, though, we at times failed to exercise patience, and David

00:10:16.649 --> 00:10:19.090
was no exception.

00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:24.769
One situation angered him so much he nearly acted in a way that would have had terrible

00:10:24.769 --> 00:10:25.769
consequences.

00:10:25.769 --> 00:10:27.690
Let's read about it.

00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:33.929
In 1 Samuel 25, that's chapter 25 now, and verse 1.

00:10:33.929 --> 00:10:39.419
1 Samuel 25, beginning with verse 1.

00:10:39.419 --> 00:10:45.299
In time Samuel died, and all Israel gathered together to mourn for him and to bury him

00:10:45.299 --> 00:10:47.539
at his house in Rema.

00:10:47.539 --> 00:10:51.980
Then David rose and went down to the wilderness of Payran.

00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:55.580
Now there was a man in Mayon whose work was in Carmel.

00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:57.740
The man was very wealthy.

00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:04.740
He had 3,000 sheep and 1,000 goats, and he was then shearing his sheep at Carmel.

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:09.259
The man's name was Nebel, and his wife's name was Abigail.

00:11:09.259 --> 00:11:15.059
The wife was discerning and beautiful, but the husband, Akela bite, was harsh, and he

00:11:15.059 --> 00:11:17.580
behaved badly.

00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:22.259
David heard in the wilderness that Nebel was shearing his sheep, so David sent ten young

00:11:22.259 --> 00:11:25.820
men to him, and David told the young men,

00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:32.620
go up to Carmel, and when you come to Nebel, ask him in my name about his welfare.

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:38.820
Then say, may you live long, and may you be well, and may your household be well, and

00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:42.100
may all that you have be well.

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:47.179
Now I hear that you are doing your shearing, when your shepherds were with us, we did not

00:11:47.179 --> 00:11:51.860
harm them, and they found nothing missing the whole time they were in Carmel.

00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:54.340
Ask your young men, and they will tell you,

00:11:54.340 --> 00:12:00.419
may my young men find favor in your eyes, because we have come at a joyous time.

00:12:00.419 --> 00:12:05.820
Please, give to your servants and to your son, David, whatever you can spare.

00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:10.700
So David's young men went and told all of this to Nebel in David's name.

00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:14.179
When they finished, Nebel answered David's servants,

00:12:14.179 --> 00:12:18.659
who is David, and who is the son of Jesse?

00:12:18.659 --> 00:12:23.419
Nowadays many servants are breaking away from their masters.

00:12:23.419 --> 00:12:29.820
You I have to take my bread and my water, and the meat that I butchered for my shears,

00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:34.740
and give it to men who come from who knows where?

00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:41.700
Sheep shearing was a time of joy and festivities, and Nebel had reason to rejoice.

00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:48.299
He had many sheep, and they had been protected from bands of robbers by David's men.

00:12:48.299 --> 00:12:53.259
Similarly, it would be expected for Nebel to show appreciation and generosity,

00:12:53.259 --> 00:13:01.860
but when David's men politely requested food, not only did he refuse, he screamed insults.

00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:10.860
Let's see how David reacted by continuing to read from 1st Samuel 25, beginning with verse 12.

00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:16.779
At that, David's young men returned and reported all these words to him.

00:13:16.779 --> 00:13:21.419
David immediately said to his men,

00:13:21.419 --> 00:13:26.779
so they all strapped on their swords, and David also strapped on his own sword,

00:13:26.779 --> 00:13:33.340
and about 400 men went up with David, while 200 men stayed with the baggage.

00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:38.980
Meanwhile, one of the servants reported to Abigail Nebel's wife.

00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:43.899
Look, David said messengers from the wilderness to wish our master well,

00:13:43.899 --> 00:13:46.379
but he screamed insults at them.

00:13:46.379 --> 00:13:48.779
Those men were very good to us.

00:13:48.779 --> 00:13:55.659
They never harmed us, and we did not miss a single thing the whole time we were together with them in the fields.

00:13:55.659 --> 00:13:59.940
They were like a protective wall around us, both by night and by day,

00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:03.220
the whole time we were with them shepherding the flock.

00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:06.100
Now decide what you are going to do.

00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:11.059
For disaster has been determined against our master, and against all his house,

00:14:11.059 --> 00:14:18.860
and he is such a worthless man that no one can speak to him.

00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:25.340
So Abigail quickly took 200 loaves of bread, two large jars of wine, five dress sheep,

00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:32.139
five sea of measures of roasted grain, 100 cakes of raisins, and 200 cakes of pressed figs,

00:14:32.139 --> 00:14:34.620
and put all of it on the dunkeys.

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:36.620
Then she said to her servants,

00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:40.059
go on ahead of me, I will follow you.

00:14:40.059 --> 00:14:44.019
But she said nothing to her husband, Nebel.

00:14:44.019 --> 00:14:48.620
While she was riding on the dunkey, and going down under cover of the mountain,

00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:53.580
just then David and his men were coming down toward her, and she met them.

00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:55.740
Now David had been saying,

00:14:55.740 --> 00:15:00.779
it was for nothing that I guarded everything that belongs to this fellow in the wilderness.

00:15:00.779 --> 00:15:04.460
Not a single thing belonging to him went missing,

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:08.860
and yet he repays me evil for good.

00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:12.460
May God do the same and more to the enemies of David,

00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:18.220
if I allow a single male of his to survive until the morning.

00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:21.179
When David learned what Nebel had said,

00:15:21.179 --> 00:15:24.700
he was furious. Immediately,

00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:30.379
had without consulting Jehovah, David told his men to strap on their swords.

00:15:30.379 --> 00:15:35.980
Then they set out to wipe out every male and Nebel's household.

00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:40.539
This was wrong. Nebel was a despicable man,

00:15:40.539 --> 00:15:45.259
but while David deserved compensation for the protection he'd given to Nebel,

00:15:45.259 --> 00:15:48.539
he had no legal right to Nebel's property.

00:15:48.539 --> 00:15:52.220
And there was absolutely no reason to murder an Israelite brother

00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:54.379
at his entire household.

00:15:54.379 --> 00:15:59.580
Meanwhile, one of Nebel's servants discerned the imminent disaster

00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:04.460
and had the courage to report what had happened to Abigail, Nebel's wife.

00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:07.019
He didn't warn Nebel who wouldn't have listened,

00:16:07.019 --> 00:16:11.019
but he found a hearing ear with Abigail,

00:16:11.019 --> 00:16:15.100
who was a woman of discernment who loved Jehovah.

00:16:15.259 --> 00:16:17.500
We know little of her background,

00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:20.620
but life with Nebel must have been difficult.

00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:25.259
He was harsh, unthankful, and arrogant.

00:16:25.259 --> 00:16:29.580
Perhaps she was trapped in an arranged marriage.

00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:35.340
Senselessness is with him. Abigail later said to David,

00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:38.539
this spiritual woman would not likely have said that,

00:16:38.539 --> 00:16:41.500
unless her husband had caused her to lose the last

00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:44.220
vestige of love and respect for him.

00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:47.740
Abigail listened to the servant,

00:16:48.379 --> 00:16:51.179
and realized that something had to be done immediately.

00:16:51.899 --> 00:16:52.379
But what?

00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:55.820
Should she speak with Nebel?

00:16:56.860 --> 00:16:59.100
No, she couldn't reason with him.

00:17:00.299 --> 00:17:02.220
Should she run away?

00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:05.900
If David was anything like Nebel,

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:07.660
that might have been the smart thing to do.

00:17:08.619 --> 00:17:12.059
But Abigail knew that David was a reasonable man,

00:17:12.059 --> 00:17:13.180
who loved Jehovah.

00:17:14.299 --> 00:17:17.660
Quickly, she gathered food and sat out to meet him.

00:17:18.299 --> 00:17:23.339
Let's read the account from 1 Samuel 25 and verse 23.

00:17:24.299 --> 00:17:26.619
When Abigail caught sight of David,

00:17:26.619 --> 00:17:28.619
she hurried down off the donkey,

00:17:28.619 --> 00:17:31.740
and threw herself face down before David,

00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:32.779
bowing to the ground.

00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:35.420
She then fell at his feet and said,

00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:40.460
My Lord, let the blame be on me.

00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:46.380
Let your servant girl speak to you and listen to the words of your servant girl.

00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:53.740
Please, do not let my Lord pay attention to this worthless Nebel,

00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:55.579
for he is just like his name.

00:17:56.619 --> 00:18:00.220
Nebel is his name, and senselessness is with him.

00:18:00.859 --> 00:18:05.819
But I, your servant girl, did not see my Lord's young men whom you sent.

00:18:06.859 --> 00:18:12.299
And now, my Lord, as surely as Jehovah is living,

00:18:12.299 --> 00:18:18.140
and as you are living, it is Jehovah who has held you back from incurring blood guilt

00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:20.700
and from taking revenge with your own hand.

00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:27.420
May your enemies and those seeking injury to my Lord become like Nebel.

00:18:28.059 --> 00:18:32.539
Now, let this gift that your servant girl has brought to my Lord,

00:18:32.539 --> 00:18:35.980
be given to the young men who are following my Lord.

00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:40.380
Pardon, please, the transgression of your servant girl.

00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:46.059
For Jehovah will without fail make for my Lord a lasting house,

00:18:46.059 --> 00:18:49.339
because my Lord is fighting the wars of Jehovah,

00:18:49.339 --> 00:18:52.940
and no evil has been found in you all your days.

00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:57.980
When someone rises up to pursue you and seeks your life,

00:18:58.779 --> 00:19:04.700
the life of my Lord will be wrapped securely in the bag of life with Jehovah your God,

00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:10.859
but the lives of your enemies, he will hurl away like stones from a sling.

00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:16.940
And when Jehovah has done for my Lord all the good things he has promised,

00:19:17.819 --> 00:19:20.859
and he appoints you as leader over Israel,

00:19:21.819 --> 00:19:28.380
you will have no remorse or regret in your heart for shedding blood without cause,

00:19:29.339 --> 00:19:31.980
and for letting the hand of my Lord take revenge.

00:19:32.859 --> 00:19:38.700
When Jehovah confers good upon my Lord, remember your servant girl.

00:19:41.859 --> 00:19:47.380
Abigail's words to David were those of a wise and spiritual woman.

00:19:48.339 --> 00:19:54.099
Her approach was humble, and deeply respectful, but her message was clear.

00:19:55.059 --> 00:20:00.099
She said that Jehovah had sent her to David to prevent him from incurring blood guilt,

00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:06.980
from shedding blood without cause, from taking revenge, and from doing something

00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:12.900
that would cause David regret and remorse, casting a shadow on the rest of his life.

00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:17.859
Abigail reminded David of these important truths.

00:20:17.859 --> 00:20:23.700
Jehovah would correct the wrong, and David should not avenge himself.

00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:30.180
Her appeal mirrored at David's reason for not going against Saul at Anguidi.

00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:34.900
Perhaps she'd learned about how David had spared Saul's life in the cave.

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:37.380
Abigail's message?

00:20:38.339 --> 00:20:40.019
Be patient.

00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:45.140
Let Jehovah sort things out in his own time and way.

00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:48.500
How did David respond to her?

00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:54.019
The account continues from 1 Samuel 25 and verse 32.

00:20:55.779 --> 00:20:57.700
At this day, it said to Abigail,

00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:03.859
Praise Jehovah the God of Israel, who sent you this day to meet me,

00:21:04.819 --> 00:21:06.500
and bless me your good sense.

00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:12.740
May you be blessed for restraining me this day from incurring blood guilt and from taking revenge

00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:20.420
with my own hands. Otherwise, as surely as Jehovah the God of Israel, who held me back from

00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:25.380
harming you as living, if you would not come quickly to meet me,

00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:30.980
by mourning there would not have remained a single male belonging to Naible.

00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:35.859
With that, David accepted from her what she had brought him and said to her,

00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:44.500
Go up in peace to your house. See, I have listened to you, and I will grant your request.

00:21:46.619 --> 00:21:53.819
David listened. In a society where men did not welcome the advice of women,

00:21:53.819 --> 00:22:02.220
this was not worthy. David listened, understood, agreed, and changed his

00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:09.180
course. Perhaps David's men were eager to fight and to plunder, but David held them back.

00:22:10.059 --> 00:22:17.819
Like David, we too may set out on a course that's not wise. Like David, we should listen to those

00:22:17.819 --> 00:22:25.500
who tried to correct us. About 10 days later, Jehovah struck Naible, and he died.

00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:31.819
Afterward, Abigail became David's wife. But what of Saul?

00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:38.859
Though he was humbled by the events in the cave, he didn't give up on chasing David.

00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:47.180
This time, David and his men were in the wilderness of Zif. For the second time, David was betrayed

00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:53.579
by the men of Zif, people from his own tribe. Let's read about it. From 1 Samuel 26,

00:22:54.380 --> 00:23:02.519
beginning with verse 2. So Saul rose up and went down to the wilderness of Zif with 3,000

00:23:02.519 --> 00:23:09.319
chosen men of Israel to look for David in the wilderness of Zif. Saul camped on the hill of Hakaila,

00:23:09.319 --> 00:23:15.319
which faces Jashimen by the road. David was then living in the wilderness, and he learned that Saul

00:23:15.319 --> 00:23:22.039
had come into the wilderness after him. So David sent spies to verify that Saul had indeed come.

00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:28.599
David later went to the place where Saul had encamped, and David saw the place where Saul and

00:23:28.599 --> 00:23:34.920
Abner the son of Nur, the chief of his army, were lying asleep. Saul lay asleep in the camping

00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:41.079
closure with the troops camping all around him. Then David said to him, elect the Hittite,

00:23:41.079 --> 00:23:47.720
and Abishai the son of Zuruya, the brother of Joab, who will go down with me into the camp to Saul.

00:23:48.519 --> 00:23:55.400
Abishai replied, I will go down with you. So David and Abishai made their way to the troops by

00:23:55.400 --> 00:24:01.400
night, and they found Saul lying asleep in the camping closure with his spear stuck into the ground

00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:08.759
next to his head. Abner and the troops were lying all around him. Abishai now said to David,

00:24:08.759 --> 00:24:16.279
today God has surrendered your enemy into your hand, and now please let me pin him to the ground

00:24:16.359 --> 00:24:25.000
with the spear just once, and I will not need to do it twice. In the cave, Saul had come to David.

00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:33.559
This time David came to Saul. With him was his nephew Abishai, a courageous warrior.

00:24:34.599 --> 00:24:40.759
They moved stealthily by moonlight through the ranks of Saul's sleeping men to the place

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:49.880
where Saul was sleeping. Now for a second time, Saul was in David's power. Abishai offered to

00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:56.279
pin Saul to the ground. To him, he seemed logical to do away with the one who had so relentlessly

00:24:56.279 --> 00:25:03.400
been seeking to kill them. David would need to do nothing. He could later credit the killing to

00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:11.079
Abishai. But David sees the opportunity to get rid of his enemy once and for all, to get the answer.

00:25:11.799 --> 00:25:17.000
Let's continue our reading from 1 Samuel 26 and verse 9.

00:25:18.359 --> 00:25:20.839
However, David said to Abishai,

00:25:20.839 --> 00:25:27.240
Do not harm him for who can lift his hand against the anointed of Chahova and remain innocent.

00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:29.079
David continued,

00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:36.200
As surely as Chahova is living, Chahova himself will strike him down, or his day will come and he will

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:42.920
die, or he will go down into battle and perish. It is unthinkable from Chahova's standpoint for me

00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:50.519
to lift my hand against the anointed of Chahova. So now take, please, the spear next to his head

00:25:50.519 --> 00:25:58.119
and the water jug and let us be on our way. So David took the spear and the water jug from next to

00:25:58.119 --> 00:26:05.240
Saul's head and they went away. No one saw or noticed them or woke up for they were all asleep

00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:13.529
because a deep sleep from Chahova had fallen upon them. David didn't fool himself into thinking

00:26:13.529 --> 00:26:20.329
it would be acceptable for Abishai to act against Saul. He recognized that Chahova would deal with Saul.

00:26:21.450 --> 00:26:26.410
Once again, he waited on Chahova to correct the situation.

00:26:26.650 --> 00:26:33.690
David considered how Chahova might act in his behalf in the future, whispering to Abishai that

00:26:33.690 --> 00:26:38.890
Saul might die in battle. Over a year later, that's what happened.

00:26:40.170 --> 00:26:47.369
Life was stressful for David during the years he lived as a fugitive, but he never became impatient

00:26:47.369 --> 00:26:53.930
with Chahova and he did what he could under the circumstances. As he was living among the

00:26:53.930 --> 00:27:00.009
Philistines, for example, David seized the opportunity to protect Israel by attacking the nation's

00:27:00.009 --> 00:27:07.289
enemies. When we face difficulties, we too can make the best of our situation by doing what we

00:27:07.289 --> 00:27:16.009
can, confident that Chahova will bring relief at the best possible time. Eventually, David did become

00:27:16.730 --> 00:27:22.970
and he ran for 40 years. Toward the end of his life, he wrote Psalm 37.

00:27:24.490 --> 00:27:29.609
Perhaps the three events that we've considered were on David's mind as he composed that Psalm.

00:27:30.809 --> 00:27:38.250
He wrote about patience. The need to wait on Chahova and the certain fulfillment of Chahova's promises.

00:27:39.049 --> 00:27:47.369
That Psalm contains both counsel and encouragement for us. Let's conclude by reading those inspired

00:27:47.369 --> 00:27:55.690
words. Let's turn to Psalm 37 verses 1 to 7. I'll give you a moment to find that. Psalm 37

00:27:56.730 --> 00:28:07.849
verses 1 to 7. Do not be upset because of evil men or envious of wrongdoers. They will quickly

00:28:07.849 --> 00:28:16.329
wither like grass and shrivel like green new grass. Trust in Chahova and do what is good,

00:28:17.210 --> 00:28:26.250
reside in the earth and act with faithfulness. Find exquisite delight in Chahova and he will grant you

00:28:26.250 --> 00:28:34.890
the desires of your heart. Commit your way to Chahova, rely on him and he will act in your behalf.

00:28:35.849 --> 00:28:42.410
He will make your righteousness shine like daybreak and your justice like the midday sun.

00:28:43.849 --> 00:28:50.809
Keep silent before Chahova and wait expectantly for him.
