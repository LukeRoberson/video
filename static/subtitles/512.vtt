00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:08.099
Malachi, chapter 2 and verse 15, do not deal treacherously with the wife of your youth.

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:13.300
Now in Malachi's day, apparently Jewish husbands were dealing treacherously with their wives

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:20.500
by divorcing them, sometimes on frivolous grounds, and perhaps so as to marry younger women.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.539
And the term treacherously was very appropriate.

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:30.699
Here the Hebrew word means to deal deceitfully, unfaithfully, a form of this verb means to

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:32.579
be a traitor.

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.659
And how Jehovah feels about this is no wonder he says what he does in verse 16 where he says

00:00:37.659 --> 00:00:41.140
for, I hate divorce.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:47.340
Jehovah hates treacherous deceitful conduct, Jehovah hates traitors.

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:53.100
In Proverbs 222 it says, the treacherous will be torn away from the earth.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.659
Well happily the majority of marriages in Jehovah's organization did not experience such treachery.

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:01.100
However, caution is still needed.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:07.140
You see, it's possible for even a once beautiful relationship to begin to sower.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.340
And not only in a marriage, but in any relationship between two very close friends, between us

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.579
and the organization, even between us and Jehovah.

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:21.819
Well Malachi, chapter 2, Jehovah here gives us a formula for never letting things get

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:22.819
to that point.

00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:25.620
Look again, the latter part of verse 15.

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:31.540
He says, so guard yourself respecting your spirit and do not deal treacherously.

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:38.459
Verse 16, latter part of it, and guard yourself respecting your spirit.

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:43.540
So you think about it, how does somebody get to the point where they begin to deal treacherously

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.140
with their beloved husband or wife?

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.099
How does somebody get to the point where two friends can no longer speak civil with each

00:01:51.099 --> 00:01:52.099
other?

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:57.739
Somebody get to the point when they turn against Jehovah's organization.

00:01:57.739 --> 00:02:03.459
We'll see long before they get to that point, something has been brewing under the surface.

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:08.580
Thus the comment, guard yourselves respecting your spirit.

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.379
And why is that appropriate?

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:17.099
Well grudges, harsh words, unresolved misunderstandings, questioning decisions that are made.

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:23.340
Maybe this can begin to fester and begin to rot a relationship from the inside out if

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.460
left unchecked.

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:30.819
Now we can see this by looking at, illustrate this, by looking at the example of two traders

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:36.860
in the Bible, looking at a Biotar and also Judas.

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.900
Now Biotar was a high priest who stuck with David right from the beginning when Saul was

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.900
trying to kill him through David's kingship, even when Absalon turned trader and tried

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.939
to take over the kingship, a Biotar was faithful to David.

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:55.900
But later in life, a Biotar became a trader.

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:01.539
He sided with David's other son, Adonija, when he tried to take over the kingship.

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:02.860
What happened?

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:08.259
Were there some unresolved issues that a Biotar buried?

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:15.340
In 1 Samuel chapter 22, it's recorded where King Saul had Dohag killed a Biotar's father

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:21.340
who was the high priest and 85 other priests because David went to a Biotar's father and

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.060
asked him for some bread and also a sword.

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.259
Only a Biotar escaped and he joined David's camp.

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:32.099
Well did, was this an unresolved issue with a Biotar?

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:34.259
Did he secretly always have in his mind?

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:39.659
You know if David had never involved my family, perhaps my father would still be alive.

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:45.300
And then there could be what could be seen as a rivalry or a competition between a Biotar

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:46.900
and Zadok.

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.699
Now Zadok was also a priest and a prophet.

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:56.819
At 1 Chronicles chapter 12 and verse 28, he's called a mighty and courageous young man.

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:03.379
However he served with Saul until Saul's death and then after Saul's death, he joined

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:04.819
David's camp.

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:09.740
Well from then on David used a Biotar and Zadok together.

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:15.659
In fact they're usually listed together but it's of interest that Zadok is always listed

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:16.980
first.

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:20.579
Even though a Biotar was the high priest.

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:27.699
Did a Biotar secretly maintain some feelings of jealousy or animosity towards Zadok?

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:33.060
See Zadok though he was a priest, he wasn't killed when Saul exterminated the priest.

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:39.339
Zadok sided with Saul and now he's the favorite one in David's camp next to a Biotar who

00:04:39.339 --> 00:04:41.779
had been faithful to David right from the beginning.

00:04:41.779 --> 00:04:47.379
See where there are some seeds of competition that grew between these two men.

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:53.459
Whatever it was, what aspect of a Biotar spirit did he not guard that caused him to eventually

00:04:53.459 --> 00:04:56.420
turn traitor against David?

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:58.740
Now another example is that of Judas.

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:03.259
Jesus showed the ultimate betrayal and treacherous treachery.

00:05:03.259 --> 00:05:08.420
Now no doubt Judas at one time loved Jesus dearly and enjoyed a very close relationship

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:09.420
with him.

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:15.220
His very appointment as an apostle indicates that Judas was also entrusted with caring for

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:18.980
the finances of Jesus and the Twelve.

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:23.860
And this also reflects favorably on him especially when you consider that this assignment wasn't

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:28.379
given to Matthew who had experience in handling the finances.

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:32.300
And we can just pitch your Judas there in the beginning listening to Jesus' words

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:37.899
eating with him, laughing with him and the others, but somewhere along the line something

00:05:37.899 --> 00:05:41.220
started to develop in his spirit.

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:46.139
Now if you look in John chapter 6, we read that account when many of the disciples were

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:50.139
stumbled by Jesus' words regarding his flesh and his blood.

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:55.420
They left off following him in verse 61, John 661, it says that the disciples began to

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:56.420
murmur.

00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:02.660
Verse 67, Jesus asked the Twelve, he says, you don't want to go also do you.

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:06.819
And we often focus on Peter's beautiful words of loyalty.

00:06:06.819 --> 00:06:12.339
But we also it seems that at this point Jesus was starting to see seeds of bitterness starting

00:06:12.339 --> 00:06:14.060
to grow in Judas.

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:19.899
Now look at what it says in John chapter 6 in verse 70 and 71.

00:06:19.899 --> 00:06:23.300
Jesus answered them, I chose you Twelve, did I not?

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:26.100
But one of you is a slander.

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:30.860
He was in fact speaking of Judas, the son of Simon Ascariot.

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:36.980
You see was Judas starting to listen to those who were beginning to murmur against Jesus?

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:42.500
At John chapter 12 and verse 6 were told that Judas was a thief, he would take money from

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:43.500
the money box.

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:45.060
Well when did that start?

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:49.300
Was that after he saw some decisions made with the finances that he didn't quite agree

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:50.779
with?

00:06:50.779 --> 00:06:56.220
According to Matthew and Mark's account, it appears that seeing Mary pour the perfumed

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:59.899
oil on Jesus was the last trigger for Judas.

00:06:59.899 --> 00:07:05.740
He strongly objects and Jesus strongly rebukes Judas in that occasion right in front of

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:06.740
everybody.

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:08.860
And Judas no doubt stung by these words.

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:15.019
He leaves and just a few days later he betrays Jesus to the priest.

00:07:15.019 --> 00:07:18.180
Well what is the point?

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:21.579
This happened in our life.

00:07:21.579 --> 00:07:29.180
In injustice, a misunderstanding, strong discipline, being embarrassed in public, maybe feelings

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:32.579
of jealousy over privileges as somebody else has.

00:07:32.579 --> 00:07:36.699
See these things happen to all of us at one time or another in our life or through our

00:07:36.699 --> 00:07:37.699
life.

00:07:37.699 --> 00:07:44.579
And each time this happens it drops a little seed if you will into our heart.

00:07:44.579 --> 00:07:50.180
And if left unchecked, a poisonous root can begin to grow that eventually can cause

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:57.860
us to become a traitor against our marriagemate, against our close friend, against the organization

00:07:57.860 --> 00:07:59.620
or even against Jehovah.

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:01.579
So what do we do?

00:08:01.579 --> 00:08:06.180
Malachi 2.15, guard yourself respecting your spirit.

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:12.060
And notice what it says in Hebrews chapter 12, in verse 15.

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:16.779
Verse 12, 15, it says, carefully watch that no one fails to obtain the undeserved kindness

00:08:16.779 --> 00:08:25.379
of God so that no poisonous root springs up to cause trouble and many are defiled by it.

00:08:25.379 --> 00:08:30.180
Well how do we go about digging up poisonous roots?

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:34.620
Well by following the beautiful principles we have in the Bible, at Matthew chapter 5, 23

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:40.820
and 24, Matthew chapter 18 and verse 15, when there are problems, when there are misunderstandings

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:45.940
talk it out, work it out, do not leave them buried and unresolved, seek to gain our brother

00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:47.460
or sister.

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:54.340
Matthew chapter 18, verse 35, forgive our brother from the heart, forgive and let go and

00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:55.820
move on.

00:08:55.820 --> 00:09:00.340
John chapter 13, verse 34, love one another.

00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:04.299
Think back to when we fell in love with our husband or our wife.

00:09:04.299 --> 00:09:05.940
What caused us to fall in love with them?

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:10.580
What caused us to develop that close bond between us and our best friend?

00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:13.340
What was it that convinced us this is the truth?

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:18.740
Think back to that and see every time we do these things, we're pulling out one of those

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:22.860
poisonous roots and stopping it from growing.

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:27.220
It's an ongoing process that we do over and over again.

00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:31.500
So may all of us be determined to guard ourselves respecting our spirit.

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:38.019
Now is not the time to allow any poisonous roots to begin to grow within us.

00:09:38.019 --> 00:09:43.379
Keep our love for and our relationship for our mate if we're married with our friends

00:09:43.379 --> 00:09:47.379
with the organization and with Jehovah strong.

00:09:47.379 --> 00:09:53.299
And this will help us to stay loyal to loved ones and to Jehovah now and in the days to

00:09:53.299 --> 00:09:53.539
come.
