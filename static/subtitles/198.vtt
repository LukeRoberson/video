WEBVTT

00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:08.279
There is no doubt that we are living in critical times hard to deal with, just as the Apostle

00:00:08.279 --> 00:00:15.320
Paul prophesied under inspiration in 2 Timothy chapter 3.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:25.440
Many times we have read Matthew chapter 24, Mark 13, Luke 21, and Revelation chapter 6.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:35.079
But who would ever have known how deeply a pandemic, so-called natural disasters, violence,

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:43.159
and unrest would affect us economically, physically, and even emotionally?

00:00:43.159 --> 00:00:48.159
Some of you dear friends face unimaginable hardships.

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:55.920
Many have experienced loss of loved ones, imprisonment, physical abuse, sickness, financial

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:04.439
problems, and sometimes a number of these or other circumstances all at the same time.

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.640
You dear brothers and sisters are in our prayers.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:19.599
With this in mind, the theme for our program is, in difficult times, Jehovah always comforts.

00:01:19.599 --> 00:01:26.359
A scripture that's become familiar to Jehovah's people is 2 Corinthians chapter 1, verses

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:28.959
3 and 4.

00:01:28.959 --> 00:01:36.480
Praise be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of tender mercies,

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:43.319
and the God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our trials, so that we may be able

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:50.879
to comfort others in any sort of trial, with the comfort that we receive from God.

00:01:50.879 --> 00:01:59.040
The study Bible says this regarding the expression the Father of tender mercies.

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:05.400
The Greek noun rendered tender mercies is here used to describe a feeling of compassion

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.199
or pity for others.

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:14.240
God is called the Father, or the source of tender mercies because compassion emanates

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.479
from Him and is part of His nature.

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:25.080
Such tender feelings move Him to act mercifully in behalf of His faithful servants who are

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.030
suffering tribulation.

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.469
Regarding the phrase, the God of all comfort, it continues.

00:02:34.469 --> 00:02:39.949
The Greek noun here rendered comfort literally means, a calling to one's side.

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:45.949
It conveys the idea of standing next to a person, helping or encouraging him when he's undergoing

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:49.030
trials or feeling sad.

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:56.270
God uses His powerful active force to give comfort and help, in situations that from a human

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:00.590
viewpoint seem hopeless.

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.189
Think about what that means.

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:10.629
And Jehovah wants us to know that whatever we face, he is by our side helping us when

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:13.229
we're undergoing any sort of trial.

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:16.949
No, he did not promise that he'd remove our trials.

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:24.509
Rather, he eases our misery or grief whenever we undergo difficulties.

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:32.509
What a beautiful word picture of God standing next to us, especially when things seem hopeless.

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:37.110
We invite you to do a personal study project.

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:43.430
Using the publication Research Guide for Jehovah's Witnesses or the Watchtower Online Library,

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.389
do a word search on comfort.

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:55.110
You'll be drawn even closer to Jehovah and appreciate His unmatched desire and ability

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.639
to comfort.

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:06.479
Jehovah also inspired Paul to show how he would stand by us to comfort us.

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:12.080
Notice Romans chapter 15 and verse 4.

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:19.319
For all the things that were written beforehand were written for our instruction so that through

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:27.720
our endurance and through the comfort from the Scriptures, we might have hope.

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:35.959
Time limits us from going into all the ways that the Bible does this.

00:04:35.959 --> 00:04:38.879
But let's take some examples.

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:45.680
A scripture that Jehovah's people have often meditated on in recent times is found in Jeremiah

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:54.709
chapter 29, when Jehovah inspired Jeremiah to convey his message to the Jews.

00:04:54.750 --> 00:05:00.310
They had been taken from Jerusalem and were captives in Babylon.

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:08.389
They were downhearted, but even while in captivity, Jehovah provided a comforting message.

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:13.629
Notice His words in Jeremiah chapter 29, verse 10.

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:20.910
When 70 years at Babylon are fulfilled, I will turn my attention to you.

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:27.550
God told these Jewish exiles that they would remain in captivity for a long time.

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:32.949
Then He made clear to them that He had a peaceful future in mind.

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:39.269
The latter part of that verse says, and I will make good by promise by bringing you back

00:05:39.269 --> 00:05:41.230
to this place.

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:46.670
In verse 11, He says, I will know the thoughts that I am thinking toward you, declares

00:05:47.629 --> 00:05:55.790
of peace and not of calamity, to give you a future and a hope.

00:05:55.790 --> 00:06:00.149
God did make good on His promise to those Israelites.

00:06:00.149 --> 00:06:04.509
He let them know that their future was to be a bright one.

00:06:04.509 --> 00:06:12.470
Regarding Jeremiah 29, 11, one commentary states,

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:18.709
it is difficult to find a more wonderful promise anywhere in Scripture that expresses

00:06:18.709 --> 00:06:26.949
the tender compassion of Yahweh, Jehovah, toward these exiles and setting before them at last

00:06:26.949 --> 00:06:32.550
a real reason for optimism and expectation.

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:39.790
Jehovah's promise strengthened men such as Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel.

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:47.470
Jehovah reassured the Jews by repeating His promise at Jeremiah 31, verse 17,

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:50.910
and there is a hope for your future.

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:55.949
Your sons will return to their own territory.

00:06:55.949 --> 00:07:03.949
Sure enough, just as Jehovah foretold, Babylon was conquered by the Persian king Cyrus,

00:07:03.949 --> 00:07:08.149
who allowed the exiles Jews to return to their homeland.

00:07:08.149 --> 00:07:13.670
After 70 years of captivity, they were back in Jerusalem.

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:18.870
Jehovah made good on His promise.

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:22.550
What does that have to do with us today?

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:30.470
The fulfilled promises of Jehovah assure us that His promises to us will come true

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:37.589
in spite of surrounding circumstances as He said, I will make good my promise.

00:07:37.589 --> 00:07:43.910
How comforting to know that, but we know that the greatest expression of Jehovah's comfort

00:07:44.709 --> 00:07:48.149
is His only begotten Son, Jesus.

00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:56.310
During His time on earth He gave people hope, Jesus engaged in a marvelous ministry

00:07:56.310 --> 00:08:00.629
healing the sick, performing powerful works, and most important,

00:08:01.269 --> 00:08:03.430
teaching people about God's kingdom.

00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:12.310
However, the greatest expression of hope to us humans is Jesus' ransom sacrifice.

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:23.779
Through His inspired word, we can see that Jehovah assures us that He not only understands what we face,

00:08:23.779 --> 00:08:27.860
but also desires to console and strengthen us.

00:08:28.819 --> 00:08:35.379
Our loving Heavenly Father especially watches over all who endeavour to do His will,

00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:42.259
but in all of His mercy He also draws humble people who may not yet know Him.

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:49.940
How many of us were in dire straits only to be introduced to the truth and to get to know

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:58.100
Jehovah at the right time? That was no coincidence. That's a consequence of Jehovah's love,

00:08:58.899 --> 00:09:02.419
and His desire to give people comfort through the hope He provides.

00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:11.129
Dear brothers and sisters, as we get closer to the Great Tribulation,

00:09:12.409 --> 00:09:17.929
we will face more distressing circumstances and during the Great Tribulation,

00:09:18.009 --> 00:09:25.049
our trust in Jehovah must be solid. We need to be sensitive and receptive to the ways in which

00:09:25.049 --> 00:09:32.330
He consoles and strengthens us. We need to keep in mind what Paul says at 2 Corinthians chapter

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:41.529
1 verse 4, perhaps even memorizing it. Jehovah is a God who comforts us in all our trunks.

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:50.279
Some time ago we interviewed two long-time members of the United States Bethel family.

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:57.480
Brother Gerald Grizzle, a helper to the Personnel Committee, and Brother Sam Robertson.

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:02.679
These two brothers served as traveling overseers for many years prior to coming to Bethel.

00:10:03.799 --> 00:10:11.480
Brother Grizzle has served at Bethel since 1978, and Brother Robertson has served here for nearly 20 years.

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:18.759
They've been assigned by the governing body to assist them in shepherding the United States Bethel family.

00:10:18.759 --> 00:10:25.320
Shepherding the Bethel family, you may ask after all, Bethelites don't have any distressing trials.

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:33.639
Listen to what our dear brothers have to say. Brother Grizzle, what are some of the challenges

00:10:33.639 --> 00:10:40.519
that members of the Bethel family face? The worldwide Bethel family is a representation

00:10:41.159 --> 00:10:49.159
of the Brotherhood. By that I mean that just as 1 Peter chapter 5 verse 9 says,

00:10:50.039 --> 00:10:56.759
they face the same kind of sufferings being experienced by the entire association

00:10:56.759 --> 00:11:04.759
of our brothers in the world. Some deal with the serious health problems, but they continue to serve.

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:15.799
Others have concerns over aging parents, and some have to give up their beloved Bethel service.

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:25.159
Still others contend with bounce of depression, but the spirit of these dear brothers and sisters

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:33.960
impels them to have the determination not to allow these challenges to dominate them,

00:11:34.519 --> 00:11:42.120
rather their faith in Jehovah's strengthens their resolve to focus on their assignments.

00:11:42.759 --> 00:11:49.320
Thank you for that insight, Brother Grizzle. Brother Robertson, how have you been able to comfort such

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:56.519
once? When we find out a Bethelite is going through a tragedy, there are four things that we do.

00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:05.320
Number one, we pray for them and develop specific spiritual points according to their needs.

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:11.799
And that's before we make the call. Number two, when we actually make the call,

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:19.320
we really listen. And I don't mean we just listen with our ears. We try to listen with our hearts.

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:24.519
We try to feel what they feel. We try to have compassion.

00:12:25.559 --> 00:12:33.240
Number three, when we use God's word to remind them they're not facing their crisis alone,

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:40.200
this is very effective. As an example, we called on a brother recently who was going through a great

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:48.200
trial. And we shared among other things Exodus chapter three and verse seven and 12. Let's take a

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:55.720
look at that. I have certainly seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt. And I've heard

00:12:55.720 --> 00:13:03.080
their outcry because of those who forced them to work. And out the ending point here, it's very

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:13.799
beautiful. Jehovah doesn't say I know how my people feel. He says, I will know the pains of my people.

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:22.600
And then in giving assurance, dealing with Moses fearing to go before Pharaoh in verse 12, just the

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:34.679
A part to this he said, I will prove to be with you. Just a few words, but so powerful where Jehovah is

00:13:34.679 --> 00:13:43.960
guaranteeing that he's going to give them undeniable proof that he's backing them up and never

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:52.200
moving away from them one inch. And this gives us comfort. Now number four, before we conclude the

00:13:52.200 --> 00:14:00.200
call, we have an ending prayer with them. And we use their names. And this is very comforting since

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:08.279
we're calling on Jehovah, the great shepherd. At first, Thessalonians 5, 14, Paul says, we urge you

00:14:08.279 --> 00:14:15.639
brothers to speak consolingly to those who are depressed, to support the weak, be patient toward

00:14:15.639 --> 00:14:21.720
all. And this is exactly what we're trying to do. Thanks for sharing those thoughts. Very

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:29.159
interesting. Brothers, Grizzle and Robertson, how has comforting others affected you?

00:14:30.039 --> 00:14:38.039
Brother Grizzle, first, please. During these challenging times, I sense Jehovah's love for his people.

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:47.399
Over the years, I have seen and experienced his care when facing difficult times.

00:14:47.879 --> 00:14:58.759
Some years ago, I lost my mother, my brother, and my father in death all within a year.

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:11.480
And in 2017, I lost my dear wife, Bonnie, after we had served Jehovah together for nearly 65 years.

00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:19.960
But with my prayer, research, and love of the friends, Jehovah has comforted me.

00:15:21.159 --> 00:15:26.200
And now, thankfully, I have been able to offer encouragement to others.

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:28.360
Very touching, brother Grizzle. Thank you.

00:15:30.039 --> 00:15:33.960
Brother Robertson, how has comforting others affected you?

00:15:34.919 --> 00:15:40.120
One of the most memorable challenges was while my wife, Linda and I were in the circuit work

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:48.200
several years ago. I lost my voice. I had to have surgery on my vocal cords and for six weeks,

00:15:48.759 --> 00:15:54.440
I could not talk. For a circuit overseer, that's like being a bird without its wings.

00:15:55.879 --> 00:16:01.000
I wrote more notes in that six weeks than I had written in my whole life.

00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:08.279
But in spite of that, and along with other situations and tragedies that we face similar to

00:16:08.279 --> 00:16:14.840
Gerald's, Jehovah has seen us through them all. And let me say it's been a real pleasure to

00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:22.120
share Jehovah's comfort with so many. And as we do, we see the governing body's interest in all

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:30.120
of Jehovah's people, including those with added responsibility. They truly reflect Jehovah's feelings

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:37.000
as the God of all comfort. Well, thank you, brothers. We really appreciate your comments.

00:16:37.559 --> 00:16:45.879
And more than the shepherding that you do is the example that you have set in enduring trials,

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:51.399
experiencing Jehovah's comfort and in comforting others. Thank you so much.

00:16:53.639 --> 00:16:58.919
The governing body has instituted similar shepherding arrangements in branch offices

00:16:58.919 --> 00:17:05.960
around the world. Now we want to talk to some of you in our audience.

00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:14.359
Because of stresses, disappointments, and hurt feelings caused by fellow believers,

00:17:15.319 --> 00:17:22.119
some have strayed from Jehovah's organization. Others may have been removed from the congregation,

00:17:22.119 --> 00:17:30.759
but now would like to return. To you we say, allow Jehovah to comfort and strengthen you.

00:17:31.559 --> 00:17:35.960
He wants you to draw close to him, and he will help you.

00:17:37.799 --> 00:17:40.039
James chapter 4 verse 8 says,

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:49.769
draw close to God, and he will draw close to you. Jehovah has great care for such ones.

00:17:51.529 --> 00:17:57.210
Let's read what he says at Ezekiel chapter 34 verse 16.

00:17:57.849 --> 00:18:07.609
The stray I will bring back, the injured I will bandage, and the weak I will strengthen.

00:18:09.049 --> 00:18:13.289
Some who have recovered have said that one of the most difficult things for them to do was

00:18:13.289 --> 00:18:21.369
across the threshold of the kingdom hall. But remember, it's Jehovah who bandages you,

00:18:21.450 --> 00:18:28.890
his sheep, helping you to heal. In the same chapter in verse 12, he says,

00:18:29.849 --> 00:18:38.490
I will care for my sheep. I will rescue them from all the places where they were scattered,

00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:47.900
in imitation of that love. The faithful slave says, we view you as lost sheep,

00:18:48.539 --> 00:18:58.539
not a lost cause. To all we say, no matter what you face, remember, in difficult times,

00:18:58.539 --> 00:19:08.700
Jehovah always comforts.
