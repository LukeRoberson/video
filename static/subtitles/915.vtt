00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:07.219
Do you ever feel that time is flying by?

00:00:07.219 --> 00:00:15.250
Or that it sometimes slows to a crawl?

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:18.250
When we are anxious or dealing with illness,

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.250
time can seem to pass slowly.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:28.449
But when we are absorbed in new and exciting experiences,

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:31.449
a day may not feel long enough.

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:41.020
To a child, growing up may seem to take forever.

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:50.560
But to an adult, it can feel like time slips away all too fast.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.560
To us, some features of creation appear motionless.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:01:00.149
But over time, they change.

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:19.980
Astronomers believe that the first stars formed billions of years ago.

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:25.980
It is difficult for us to conceive of such an enormous length of time.

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:36.420
But Jehovah, who created the stars, is from everlasting to everlasting.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.420
He is not restrained or pressured by time.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.420
But neither is he slow to act.

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.420
He always acts at exactly the right time.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.420
Appreciating Jehovah's view of time helps us to be patient

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.420
while we await his new world.
