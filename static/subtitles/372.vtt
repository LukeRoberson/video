00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:10.019
Their best one is like a briar, their most upright one is worse than a thorn hedge.

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:16.059
This is an example of many agricultural metaphors that Micah used in his writing.

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:18.260
But who is he talking about?

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:23.859
Why did he say this and what lesson can we take away from today's text?

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:28.140
To find the historical setting, it's helpful to look at the table of Bible books that

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.740
appears on page 1662 of the printed edition of our New World Translation.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:38.939
But if you're using the JW Library app, this is what you need to do.

00:00:38.939 --> 00:00:40.899
Please follow along.

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:45.619
First, go to your homepage for the Bible.

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:51.460
In the menu bar at the top, you'll see the word introduction at the left.

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:57.140
At the bottom of the list that comes up, you'll see names and order of the books.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.140
Tap that.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.780
And don't be put off by the fact that you're only seeing the names and order of the books.

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.819
Rather, scroll all the way down to the bottom.

00:01:06.819 --> 00:01:11.939
And there you will see table of books of the Bible.

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.780
Tap that.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.739
You can bookmark it if you'd like to get there faster the next time.

00:01:17.739 --> 00:01:20.379
And then scroll down to Micah.

00:01:20.379 --> 00:01:24.659
What do we learn about the context of our day's text written by Micah?

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.060
Do that?

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.379
Where was he in Judah?

00:01:28.379 --> 00:01:34.340
When did he write this prophecy, sometime before the year 717 BCE?

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.379
And what time period does his writing cover?

00:01:36.379 --> 00:01:43.219
The 60 years spanning from 777 to 717, counting backwards toward the time of Jesus.

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:46.140
Now, what was happening during those 60 years?

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.219
We have a chart in Appendix A6 that helps us.

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:54.579
Again, if you're following along in Watchtower Library, go to the upper left hand

00:01:54.579 --> 00:02:00.780
corner of your screen and tap the menu bar, names and order, that is to say, go back.

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.980
There you'll see toward the bottom of the list, Appendix A, or you can always go back

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:09.219
to the home page and select Appendix A from the menu ribbon.

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:15.340
In any event, when you get to Appendix A, you'll see the option for A6 chart, prophets

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.860
and kings of Judah and of Israel.

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:24.979
And remember, we're looking for what life was like during the 60 years between 777 and

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:25.979
717.

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:30.419
So likely part two would reveal what we're looking for, tap part two.

00:02:30.419 --> 00:02:32.979
There we find this beautiful chart.

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:39.580
What does it tell us that Micah was a contemporary of Isaiah and Hosea, and that his service is

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:46.939
a prophet in Judah, rendering the reins of Jotham for 16 years, wicked King A has for 16

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:53.900
years, but also most of Hezekiah's 29-year reign.

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.340
Meanwhile, what was happening up in the Northern Ten Tribe Kingdom?

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:07.020
Look at the chart again on the right, starting in 777 BCE, 19 years left of Pekha's reign,

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.259
and then nine years of Hosea's rule.

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:12.539
But here things begin to destabilize.

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:18.659
We see the Assyrian monarchy moving in, exerting its influence in Israel's affairs.

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:24.580
And then in 740, it's all over for the Northern Ten Tribe Kingdom.

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.699
Did those events have an influence on the south?

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:33.620
Certainly it fed the Assyrians pride, fueling their belief that they could come in and overtake

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.460
Judah in the same fashion.

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:40.979
And what do we know about Jotham, A has and Hezekiah?

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:46.419
Well, it was during Jotham's reign that Judah began to experience military pressure from

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:53.139
an alliance between King Pekha and King Reason of Syria.

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:58.780
And that alliance would eventually weaken Judah's defenses and leave them open to brutal

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:06.539
attacks by the Edomites in the southeast and the Philistines coming from the west.

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:11.099
However, none of that humbled wicked king A has.

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:12.659
He let it debauched life.

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:14.699
He sought refuge with pagan rulers.

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:19.740
He adopted their way of worship, and he even sacrificed his own sons in the fire in the

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:21.540
valley of Hennum.

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:26.379
No wonder Micah wrote what he did in the words of today's text.

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:33.319
Let's go back and read it now from Micah 7, 2 through 4.

00:04:33.319 --> 00:04:37.759
The loyal one has perished from the earth.

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:42.120
Young men there is no one upright.

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:48.680
All of them lie an ambush for bloodshed, each hunts his own brother with a dragnet.

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.079
Their hands are expert at doing what is bad.

00:04:52.079 --> 00:04:55.600
The prince is making demands.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.319
The judge asks for a reward.

00:04:58.319 --> 00:05:04.120
The prominent one makes known his desires, and they work it out together.

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.720
Their best one is like thorns.

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:14.160
Their most upright one is worse than a thorn hedge.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.920
So what's the meaning of the metaphor?

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.079
The topic?

00:05:18.079 --> 00:05:20.120
The unfaithful Israelites.

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:21.120
The image?

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.279
A patch of briars and thorns.

00:05:24.279 --> 00:05:26.920
The point of similarity.

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:32.160
Just as getting stuck in briars or a thorn hedge injures anyone who walks into it.

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:36.800
These corrupt Israelites harmed anyone with whom they had dealings.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.759
Now how far did the corruption go?

00:05:38.759 --> 00:05:41.279
Back in verse 2 it said it was all pervasive.

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:44.560
There was no one, not even one who was upright.

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:48.199
Verse 3 indicated it reached the highest levels of society.

00:05:48.199 --> 00:05:50.600
The prominent expressed their wishes.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:56.160
The judges accepted bribes to carry out those wishes and they all were in cahoots.

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.480
They worked it out together.

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:03.879
Now verse 3 says this included the prince.

00:06:03.879 --> 00:06:10.839
Who would have been the prince in the days of King Ahaz?

00:06:10.839 --> 00:06:13.519
Hezekiah?

00:06:13.519 --> 00:06:19.040
Micah have written those words during the actual reign of Hezekiah.

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:22.680
If so, how would Hezekiah respond?

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.240
Wasn't he a good king?

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:28.519
Wouldn't he say, now wait a minute, prophet, you've got it all wrong.

00:06:28.519 --> 00:06:30.199
Would he get offended?

00:06:30.199 --> 00:06:34.480
Would he imprison Micah for sedition?

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:39.800
We gain a fascinating insight from a conversation that took place a century or so later recorded

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:43.240
by Jeremiah in chapter 26.

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:49.839
Notice what it says in Jeremiah 26, 18 and 19.

00:06:49.839 --> 00:06:55.959
Micah of Moreshath was prophesying in the days of King Ahaz, and he said to all the people

00:06:55.959 --> 00:06:59.199
of Judah, this is what Jehovah of Army says.

00:06:59.199 --> 00:07:08.959
During Micah 312, verse 19, did Hezekiah of Judah and all Judah then put him to death?

00:07:08.959 --> 00:07:16.279
Did he not fear Jehovah and beg for Jehovah's favor so that Jehovah changed his mind concerning

00:07:16.279 --> 00:07:20.899
the calamity that he had spoken against them?

00:07:20.899 --> 00:07:31.420
Hezekiah repented at what Micah preached, fascinating insight.

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:39.019
Did Micah stir in young Hezekiah a desire to be a better student of God's law?

00:07:39.019 --> 00:07:49.180
Did Hezekiah as a prince then write the 119th Psalm with its famous concluding words,

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:55.459
I have strayed like a lost sheep, search for your servant, for I have not forgotten your

00:07:55.459 --> 00:08:04.139
commandment, although we can't say for certain, it's all within the realm of possibility.

00:08:04.139 --> 00:08:13.139
And what we do know is that Hezekiah took Micah's counsel to heart because Micah was

00:08:13.139 --> 00:08:14.139
patient.

00:08:14.139 --> 00:08:17.139
Micah stuck with His assignment.

00:08:17.139 --> 00:08:24.980
Even though Micah wrote the words of today's text, He refused to give up hope in Jehovah's

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:33.580
ability to bring about changes in people's hearts and people's thinking.

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:35.460
Micah's patience paid off.

00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:37.139
He waited on Jehovah.

00:08:37.139 --> 00:08:46.659
He saw wonderful results right in his own lifetime and you too are acting loyally in a very

00:08:46.659 --> 00:08:50.100
disloyal world.

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:55.100
What will be the effect of your patient endurance on others today?
