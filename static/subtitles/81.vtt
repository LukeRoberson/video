00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:06.910
Welcome. I'm here with my good friend and co-host Chris Mayver.

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:09.910
Chris was in store for this much program.

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:11.910
Thanks, Brother Heard.

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:18.420
We'll see the value of learning from the good example of Philip the Evangelizer.

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.420
We'll also learn why Jehovah is still the best teacher today.

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:27.420
And our new song shows how, by safeguarding our heart and mind,

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.420
we can focus on Jehovah's blessings.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:36.420
This is JW Broadcasting for April 20, 21.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:59.100
In addressing our theme, is your best good enough?

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.100
I like to start by reading Galatians 6.4.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:08.739
He says, but let each one examine his own actions,

00:01:08.739 --> 00:01:13.739
and then he will have calls for rejoicing in regard to himself alone,

00:01:13.739 --> 00:01:17.739
and not in comparison with the other person.

00:01:17.739 --> 00:01:20.739
We're told to examine our own actions.

00:01:20.739 --> 00:01:25.739
So ask yourself, how am I doing spiritually?

00:01:25.739 --> 00:01:29.739
Am I happy with my attendance at Christian meeting?

00:01:29.739 --> 00:01:34.739
Do I participate by sharing meaningful comments as able?

00:01:34.739 --> 00:01:37.739
How about my personal study of the Bible?

00:01:37.739 --> 00:01:41.739
Let me examine my involvement in the ministry.

00:01:41.739 --> 00:01:45.739
Could I do better in preparing for my return visit?

00:01:45.739 --> 00:01:49.739
Do I conduct any Bible studies with interested ones?

00:01:49.739 --> 00:01:54.739
If so, am I content with what I am doing?

00:01:54.739 --> 00:02:00.739
In fact, you're asking yourself, is my best good enough?

00:02:00.739 --> 00:02:06.739
We might see others in the congregation that are doing more than we are.

00:02:06.739 --> 00:02:10.740
But then we look back at Galatians 6.4 again,

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:17.740
and it clearly said that I should not compare myself with the other person.

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.740
So we could quickly assume that we're doing what we can,

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.740
reasoning that is good enough.

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.740
But let's not forget the first part of a verse.

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:34.740
We are to examine our own actions.

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.740
We need to compare what we are doing

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:42.740
with what we personally could be doing.

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:51.069
We need to be active and not become self-satisfied and overconfident.

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:54.069
First Corinthians 10-12 provides this warning.

00:02:54.069 --> 00:03:00.069
So let the one who thinks he is standing beware that he does not fall.

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:06.069
But you may say, I'm doing my best, what more can I do?

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:11.069
Take a good look at your best, scrutinize it.

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:16.069
Examine very closely all you're doing with the time that you have.

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:21.069
Can mundane activity be replaced with theocratic activity?

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:23.069
What do you see?

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:26.069
Is your best good enough?

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:28.069
It may be.

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:30.069
It may not.

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:33.069
It depends on one's output.

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:36.069
What are some examples?

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:38.069
A runner and a race.

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:40.069
He practices.

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:41.069
Train.

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:43.069
Eat the right things.

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:46.069
Keeps a lean, healthy body.

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:49.069
Where's the best running shoes?

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:51.069
And so forth.

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:57.069
He gives his best, but loses the race to someone faster.

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:01.069
His best was not good enough.

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:02.069
Why?

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:07.069
It was compared to whether he was faster than his competitors.

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:18.069
Johann Blake lost to you saying the boat in a 100 meter event in 2012 by just a fraction of a second.

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:23.069
He did his best, but his best wasn't good enough.

00:04:23.069 --> 00:04:27.639
A mother and daughter.

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:30.639
The daughter is in the second grade of school.

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:32.639
She brings home a picture.

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:34.639
She drew in class.

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:37.639
The teacher had put a B minus on the picture.

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:40.639
The daughter shows it to her mother.

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:46.639
And the mother crosses out the B minus and puts an A plus on it.

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:51.639
She then tapes the picture on the refrigerator.

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:56.639
What is the difference between the teacher and the mother?

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:01.639
The teacher compares the student to other classmates of her age.

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:08.980
The mother grades her according to her best, not in comparison with others.

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:14.980
Jehovah does not compare your best with the best of others.

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:17.980
Let's look at Psalm 103, 14.

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:27.899
When Jehovah examines our spiritual accomplishments, what's one of his measuring sticks?

00:05:27.899 --> 00:05:30.899
Psalm 103, 14.

00:05:30.899 --> 00:05:38.899
For he well knows how we are formed, remembering that we are dust.

00:05:38.899 --> 00:05:44.899
Dust is used figuratively, indicating the mankind's frailty and loneliness.

00:05:44.899 --> 00:05:52.899
Remembering that we are dust, Jehovah never asks more of us than we can give.

00:05:52.899 --> 00:06:01.899
However, he expects us to obey his commands to the best of our own ability.

00:06:01.899 --> 00:06:03.899
Mark 12.30.

00:06:03.899 --> 00:06:06.899
You can likely quote it from memory.

00:06:06.899 --> 00:06:08.899
Verse 30 says,

00:06:08.899 --> 00:06:23.899
You must love Jehovah your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole mind and with your whole strength.

00:06:23.899 --> 00:06:28.899
This embraces everything we have, all that we are.

00:06:28.899 --> 00:06:30.899
You go in service.

00:06:30.899 --> 00:06:35.899
You use your whole strength to accomplish it. That's commendable.

00:06:35.899 --> 00:06:51.899
But what good is it to use our whole strength, going into service, if our mind cannot direct our tongue to say the right things when we talk to a person?

00:06:51.899 --> 00:06:58.899
I used a lot of my strength walking from door to door, climbing stairs and so forth.

00:06:58.899 --> 00:07:04.899
And yet no one let me get past my introduction.

00:07:04.899 --> 00:07:05.899
Question.

00:07:05.899 --> 00:07:10.899
Was that the best introduction you could get?

00:07:10.899 --> 00:07:14.899
How long have you been using that introduction?

00:07:14.899 --> 00:07:16.899
Would a new one help?

00:07:16.899 --> 00:07:26.899
Would using your whole mind by means of advanced preparation result in making your best even better?

00:07:27.899 --> 00:07:33.899
Have you tried to use some of the introductions demonstrated at our midweek meetings?

00:07:33.899 --> 00:07:40.899
Or some of those found in the reasoning from the Scriptures book, pages 9 through 15?

00:07:40.899 --> 00:07:46.899
What does the householder see in your face when she opens the door?

00:07:46.899 --> 00:07:51.899
Is your countenance radiating pleasantness and kindness?

00:07:51.899 --> 00:07:55.899
Does she see good news or bad news?

00:07:55.899 --> 00:07:58.899
Do you look happy or sad?

00:07:58.899 --> 00:08:05.899
The message we're commissioned to deliver today is the good news of the Kingdom.

00:08:05.899 --> 00:08:10.899
We expect it to change sometime in the near future.

00:08:10.899 --> 00:08:14.899
Do the best you can until you know better.

00:08:14.899 --> 00:08:20.899
Then when you know better, you can do better.

00:08:20.899 --> 00:08:26.899
You attend all congregation meetings and pay rapt attention with your mind.

00:08:26.899 --> 00:08:28.899
You're to be commended.

00:08:28.899 --> 00:08:34.899
But is that all that's required to love Jehovah with our whole mind?

00:08:34.899 --> 00:08:45.899
Are we meditating on the knowledge that we receive at our meetings in order to draw close to Jehovah?

00:08:45.899 --> 00:08:53.899
James 4.8 says, draw close to God and He will draw close to you.

00:08:53.899 --> 00:08:58.899
That's one benefit we receive from our meeting attendance.

00:08:58.899 --> 00:09:07.519
Let's read Hebrews 10.24 and 25.

00:09:07.519 --> 00:09:10.519
This is another benefit of regular meeting attendance.

00:09:10.519 --> 00:09:16.519
In this way, we give and receive in encouragement.

00:09:16.519 --> 00:09:27.519
Verse 24 and 25, read, and let us consider one another so as to incite to love and fine works.

00:09:27.519 --> 00:09:35.519
Not for seeking our meeting together as some have the custom, but encouraging one another.

00:09:35.519 --> 00:09:41.519
And all the more so as you see the day drawing near.

00:09:41.519 --> 00:09:46.519
Do you give comments and meetings? Are they well prepared?

00:09:46.519 --> 00:09:49.519
Do they encourage your brothers and sisters?

00:09:49.519 --> 00:09:57.519
Are you giving your best? If so, then your best is good enough.

00:09:57.519 --> 00:10:03.519
What about your personal study or family worship?

00:10:03.519 --> 00:10:09.519
Are you doing your best? Is your best good enough?

00:10:09.519 --> 00:10:14.519
I read all the watchtowers and the wigs when they come out, you say.

00:10:14.519 --> 00:10:18.519
It goes without saying that that's good.

00:10:18.519 --> 00:10:30.519
What did you find in what you read that will deepen your love and appreciation for Jehovah and draw you closer to Him?

00:10:30.519 --> 00:10:37.519
Do you use your whole mind to meditate and continue to think about it?

00:10:37.519 --> 00:10:42.519
Thus spiking it down deep into your heart?

00:10:42.519 --> 00:10:53.519
Some things we learn may not be immediately applicable, but can be regurgitated and applied later as needed.

00:10:53.519 --> 00:11:00.519
Are you giving serious attention to the spiritual needs of your wife and children?

00:11:00.519 --> 00:11:06.519
Yes, you have a family worship most weeks. That's commendable.

00:11:06.519 --> 00:11:13.519
Do you prepare well for it or just throw something together at the last minute?

00:11:13.519 --> 00:11:23.519
What if your wife just threw something on the table for dinner each evening without giving any thought to the health needs of the family?

00:11:23.519 --> 00:11:29.519
Think. Is your best good enough?

00:11:29.519 --> 00:11:33.519
We can slap a pig and he'll enjoy it.

00:11:33.519 --> 00:11:38.519
But give the same garbage to a cow and she'll ignore it.

00:11:38.519 --> 00:11:43.519
Why are we considering is your best good enough?

00:11:44.519 --> 00:11:58.519
It's only as a reminder to look at what we think to be our best in what we're doing for ourselves, our families and our spiritual brothers and sisters.

00:11:58.519 --> 00:12:06.519
And remember, our best is not compare with the best of another brother or sister.

00:12:06.519 --> 00:12:16.519
Only Jehovah knows when we're doing our best. He is a righteous and fair judge.

00:12:16.519 --> 00:12:23.519
Our knowledge, even of ourself, can be faulty due to inherited sin.

00:12:23.519 --> 00:12:31.519
Therefore it's wisdom on our part to keep examining ourselves to see where we might improve.

00:12:31.519 --> 00:12:34.519
So is your best good enough?

00:12:34.519 --> 00:12:41.889
I'd like to think it is what new you think.

00:12:41.889 --> 00:12:44.889
What would you like to be known for?

00:12:44.889 --> 00:12:50.889
In the first century, a servant of Jehovah named Philip was known as the evangelizer.

00:12:50.889 --> 00:13:04.590
In the following dramatization, we'll learn how Philip earned this reputation and what we can apply from his good example.

00:13:04.590 --> 00:13:09.590
Please find yourself. It's time to start our graduation program.

00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:15.419
We never dreamed this would happen.

00:13:15.419 --> 00:13:21.419
This is a very special day. All of us have been anxiously waiting for. We're happy to see all of you.

00:13:21.419 --> 00:13:23.419
It all started a few years ago.

00:13:23.419 --> 00:13:30.879
If you'd like to have the circuit over here and his wife for a meal, please see it.

00:13:30.879 --> 00:13:34.879
It was during that visit and this question.

00:13:34.879 --> 00:13:42.879
His theme on Tuesday is, what lessons can we learn from Philip, the evangelizer?

00:13:42.879 --> 00:13:46.879
Hmm. What could we learn from Philip?

00:13:46.879 --> 00:13:50.879
Honestly, we were already busy with the right things.

00:13:50.879 --> 00:14:01.990
Lily and the girls helped out wherever they could. I worked on Kingdom Hall maintenance projects.

00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:12.450
And we had a regular schedule for the ministry.

00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:25.360
But like in a lot of places, when someone showed interest, it was tough to find them again.

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:28.360
I wondered if our spiritual routine needed an update.

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:50.879
Looking forward to that talk, I decided we'd research Philip for family worship, Acts chapter 6.

00:14:50.879 --> 00:15:03.419
Philip was one of seven brothers selected to distribute food to Christian widows in Jerusalem.

00:15:03.419 --> 00:15:19.009
That was an important assignment. He did so much more than that.

00:15:19.009 --> 00:15:42.230
This is interesting.

00:15:42.230 --> 00:16:10.720
Because of the persecution, Philip had to flee from Jerusalem to Samaria.

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:32.950
Samaria had an accepted the word of Jehovah yet.

00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:41.750
But Philip saw that trial as a spiritual opportunity.

00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:44.750
Samaria was largely untouched by the preaching work.

00:16:44.750 --> 00:17:01.240
Philip declared the good news sell asleep and many believe and got baptized.

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:10.380
But sometime later, an angel spoke with him.

00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:29.420
He told Philip to get up and go to the south.

00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:33.420
That led him to find a Ethiopian unit and preach in other cities.

00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:38.890
Philip was willing to serve wherever there was a need.

00:17:38.890 --> 00:17:41.890
And he always kept that evangelizing spirit.

00:17:41.890 --> 00:17:49.470
Some 20 years later, he was still known as the evangelizer.

00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:54.740
By that time, his life had changed.

00:17:54.740 --> 00:18:01.619
He was a family man with four daughters.

00:18:01.619 --> 00:18:14.569
But that didn't stop him from showing hospitality when Paul and his companions came to visit.

00:18:14.569 --> 00:18:24.460
Visits like that must have been full of spiritual lessons for his daughters.

00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:29.869
That night, we came up with a few things we wanted to do.

00:18:29.869 --> 00:18:32.869
We started by having the circuit over a year to lunch.

00:18:32.869 --> 00:18:40.029
We had it made time for that in a while.

00:18:40.029 --> 00:18:45.029
Alex and Carla's experiences made the girls excited to reach their own spiritual goals.

00:18:45.029 --> 00:19:02.039
But like Philip, changes came that we didn't expect.

00:19:02.039 --> 00:19:08.980
I was out of work for a few months.

00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:12.990
It was a stressful time.

00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:20.109
But also a spiritual opportunity.

00:19:20.109 --> 00:19:29.799
I could visit people at different times of the day.

00:19:29.799 --> 00:19:33.799
We tried to make the most of the situation and preach zealously.

00:19:33.799 --> 00:19:42.759
Like Philip, in here we are.

00:19:42.759 --> 00:19:55.410
Watching our girls graduate from the School for Kingdom Evangelizers.

00:19:55.410 --> 00:20:01.410
Those few lessons made a big difference for this family of evangelizers.

00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:07.259
The Bible is rich with examples like Philip.

00:20:07.259 --> 00:20:12.259
And we have many fine examples among Jehovah's people in our day.

00:20:12.259 --> 00:20:18.259
Learning from them helps us make good decisions and manage serious issues.

00:20:18.259 --> 00:20:23.259
Let's pay attention to this interview with Eugene and Odeal in Tesarayo,

00:20:23.259 --> 00:20:27.259
who attended the 145th class of Gilead.

00:20:27.259 --> 00:21:03.009
What can we learn from their example of faith and and darts?

00:21:03.009 --> 00:21:08.009
With us today, we have Eugene and Odeal, Nasidiayo.

00:21:08.009 --> 00:21:12.009
They've graduated from the 145th class of Gilead.

00:21:12.009 --> 00:21:15.009
And they lived through this mayhem.

00:21:15.009 --> 00:21:18.009
Odeal, now your family is tootsy.

00:21:18.009 --> 00:21:22.009
Now this must have certainly put them in danger.

00:21:22.009 --> 00:21:25.009
The killing was happening all over the country.

00:21:25.009 --> 00:21:30.009
So my parents and my brother were killed.

00:21:30.009 --> 00:21:38.960
I saw that some religious readers were involved in killing people in genocide.

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:44.960
I couldn't believe how people who were previously living together friendly.

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:48.960
Now they start killing their neighbors.

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:51.960
How did you get contact with the truth?

00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:57.960
After the genocide, I was taken by my aunt, whose family were Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:21:57.960 --> 00:22:00.960
So I began studying the Bible with them.

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:03.960
I was in a live forever book.

00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:06.960
I saw a picture of a priest,

00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:08.960
bracing people in the church,

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:12.960
and then he was bracing troops who were going to Kiev.

00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:17.960
But also I could see how brothers and sisters in the congregation

00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:20.960
with love and courage,

00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:23.960
this could be their life to take care of one another.

00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:25.960
Oh, that's touching.

00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:30.960
Now Eugene, your family was not a direct target of the violence.

00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:33.960
But what other hardships did you face?

00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:37.960
The economic situation was very difficult.

00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:39.960
My family had no money,

00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:42.960
and they could not buy food.

00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:44.960
I remember my mom.

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:48.960
I can still see her lying on the bed in complete despair,

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:53.960
not knowing what she can do for us children.

00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:56.960
The elders asked me to go to the kingdom hall.

00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:59.960
And when I arrived,

00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:04.960
they handed me 18,000 wand and francs.

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:09.960
The elders told me that my brothers and sisters from abroad

00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:12.960
offered us this gift.

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:17.960
So I immediately ran back home, found my mom still lying on the bed.

00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:20.960
I gave her the money.

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:23.960
I can still see my mom crying

00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:30.960
because of the joy and thankfulness of what the brothers had done.

00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:32.960
Excellent.

00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:36.960
Now, looking back at all the injustices you and your family have suffered,

00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:41.960
Odeal, what has helped you to not become a bitter person?

00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:44.960
The preaching work is very important to me,

00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:48.960
because the more I talk about the Bible promises,

00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:50.960
they become real to me.

00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:53.960
When I talk about the resurrection hope,

00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:55.960
the condition of the death,

00:23:55.960 --> 00:24:00.960
this helped me to feel that my loved ones are not suffering anymore,

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:03.960
and they are waiting to be resurrected.

00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:09.269
So this makes me feel happy.

00:24:09.269 --> 00:24:15.269
The scripture that comes to mind is first to John chapter 2, verse 6 and 7,

00:24:15.269 --> 00:24:20.269
where the Apostle John repeated this Jesus command

00:24:20.269 --> 00:24:25.269
of loving one another just as Jesus loved us.

00:24:25.269 --> 00:24:29.269
Christians during that time were facing persecution,

00:24:29.269 --> 00:24:34.269
and now they needed the fresh application of that scripture in their lives.

00:24:34.269 --> 00:24:36.269
We all love one another,

00:24:36.269 --> 00:24:42.269
but during difficult moments like the one our brothers and Randa went through,

00:24:42.269 --> 00:24:49.269
they needed that fresh application of this very commandment of Jesus,

00:24:49.269 --> 00:24:58.269
like one loving one another to the point of risking our lives for our brothers.

00:24:58.269 --> 00:25:02.269
Being here in Gilead has reminded me of that fact,

00:25:02.269 --> 00:25:10.269
that I really need to love my brothers and sisters as Jesus loved us.

00:25:10.269 --> 00:25:17.269
You brothers and sisters in Randa have given us a wonderful example of courage and faith and love.

00:25:17.269 --> 00:25:22.269
Please know we love you all very much.

00:25:22.269 --> 00:25:23.269
Thank you.

00:25:23.269 --> 00:25:30.970
Thank you for joining us on this edition of Extraordinary Experiences.

00:25:30.970 --> 00:25:33.970
That was a very moving experience.

00:25:33.970 --> 00:25:41.970
We can imitate the good example of our brothers in Randa by taking care of brothers and sisters when they're in need.

00:25:41.970 --> 00:25:48.970
In recent years, our video dramas have brought to life Jonah, Josiah, and other examples of faith.

00:25:48.970 --> 00:25:54.970
Have you wondered how our brothers ensure that these dramas are both vivid and accurate?

00:25:54.970 --> 00:25:58.970
Well, let's go behind the scenes of one of our latest dramas,

00:25:58.970 --> 00:26:02.970
Nehemiah, the joy of Jehovah is your stronghold.

00:26:02.970 --> 00:26:18.279
In Nehemiah's day, the Jews joyfully embarked on a massive building project.

00:26:18.279 --> 00:26:24.279
With Jehovah's direction and help, they were able to finish the work in just 52 days.

00:26:24.279 --> 00:26:27.279
You look like you've been working.

00:26:27.279 --> 00:26:32.279
During the production of the film, Nehemiah, the joy of Jehovah is your stronghold.

00:26:32.279 --> 00:26:35.279
The walls of Jerusalem were built once again,

00:26:35.279 --> 00:26:40.279
but this time at Mount Ebo Studios in Brewster, New York.

00:26:40.279 --> 00:26:46.259
A variety of skills were needed to produce this drama.

00:26:48.990 --> 00:26:57.990
With many volunteers coming together using their time, energy, and abilities to create an accurate teaching tool.

00:26:57.990 --> 00:27:17.660
And they found great joy in their work.

00:27:17.660 --> 00:27:24.349
Good planning was needed right at the start of production.

00:27:24.349 --> 00:27:31.680
Every day began with a scriptural discussion and prayer.

00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:43.589
The costume and makeup departments prepared the actors to appear on set.

00:27:43.589 --> 00:27:53.259
The assistance was provided to help actors feel more comfortable in front of the cameras.

00:27:53.259 --> 00:27:57.940
Action!

00:27:57.940 --> 00:27:58.940
Please.

00:27:58.940 --> 00:28:00.940
Have they tacked anyone yet?

00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:06.940
While the production team was filming in one studio,

00:28:06.940 --> 00:28:13.269
sets were being prepared on another.

00:28:13.269 --> 00:28:23.720
To add to the realism, detailed props were made, many using 3D printing.

00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:28.720
With all of these researched and crafted costumes, sets, and props combined,

00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:33.720
environments were designed to accurately recreate the time period.

00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:43.079
But even more was needed to convey what it was like to live in Jerusalem during Nehemiah's day.

00:28:43.079 --> 00:28:47.079
For example, there were many animals on set.

00:29:13.569 --> 00:29:24.170
Even after principal filming was completed, sets built in the studio were extended using advanced visual effects.

00:29:24.170 --> 00:29:28.170
Digital construction work was done by the visual effects team.

00:29:28.170 --> 00:30:15.220
Yes, building is a legacy of God's people.

00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:22.220
Nehemiah was one of many who throughout history devoted their energies to supporting the work of building.

00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:31.359
In a similar way, the production team that made Nehemiah the joy of Jehovah is your stronghold,

00:30:31.359 --> 00:30:39.359
joyfully worked hard to produce a film that helps build love and appreciation in the hearts of God's people.

00:30:39.359 --> 00:30:47.140
We learn from good examples like Nehemiah and many others.

00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:54.140
But as we'll see in our next video, we also learn important lessons from those who made poor decisions.

00:30:54.140 --> 00:31:02.960
I was born to Christian parents.

00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:06.960
They always tried to instill in us a love for Jehovah.

00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:14.960
But I felt quite lonely growing up and I felt like I didn't have people who wanted to do the same things.

00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:18.960
The lifestyle, the way they spoke, the music they were listening to.

00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:24.960
And so for me, the real struggle was where do I stand, where are my boundaries going to be set?

00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:29.960
It's really hard because it could be the difference between having a friend and not having a friend.

00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:35.960
Over the years, I've talked to several who perhaps drifted a little bit in the truth.

00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:39.960
And that unfortunately happened to some of my friends.

00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:42.960
Nobody is immune to the pressures of the world.

00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:46.960
I was born and raised by Christian parents.

00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:52.960
So all through my childhood and teenage years, I was happy serving Jehovah.

00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:57.960
But they got a little bit harder when I started to work.

00:31:57.960 --> 00:32:03.960
People at work would ask to do social activities with them, go for a drink and things.

00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:07.960
But there were men who would ask me to go out with them.

00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:10.960
It's flattering when someone shows interest in you.

00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:16.960
So it was nice, but it was hard to have to constantly remind yourself,

00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:19.960
you know that this is not going to be successful.

00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:22.960
You know this person doesn't love Jehovah.

00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:27.960
I remember one day I drove into a parking lot and I just prayed to Jehovah with tears in my eyes.

00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:29.960
And I said, this is too hard.

00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:31.960
This is just too hard.

00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:34.960
The people that were my friends are starting to leave the truth.

00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:37.960
I feel quite lonely, but I want to serve you.

00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:39.960
To that prayer I went home.

00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:42.960
I spoke to my mom and she got really quiet and she just looked at me and said,

00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:46.960
anything Jehovah tells you is to benefit yourself.

00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:49.960
And it clicked in that moment that Jehovah was saying to me,

00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:52.960
I love you, I will carry you through this time.

00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:55.960
And you'll see that there will be all these blessings that open up to you

00:32:55.960 --> 00:33:00.960
and you have a really wonderful, colorful life, but you have to hang in there.

00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:04.960
Even though it was hard, I resisted the temptation,

00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:08.960
but someone close to me who faced the same pressure,

00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:11.960
gave in and ended up leaving Jehovah.

00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:17.960
But when I heard that she was disfellowshipped,

00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:25.210
it was just completely hit me so hard

00:33:25.210 --> 00:33:31.210
because you really are just worried about what is going to happen with their future.

00:33:31.210 --> 00:33:34.210
After a while, she did come back to Jehovah.

00:33:34.210 --> 00:33:37.210
She's raising a child on her own.

00:33:37.210 --> 00:33:40.210
One day we were having a video chat

00:33:40.210 --> 00:33:43.210
and with a little one just playing in the background.

00:33:43.210 --> 00:33:46.210
But she suddenly turned around and went,

00:33:46.210 --> 00:33:50.210
mommy, why did you marry someone who doesn't love Jehovah?

00:33:50.210 --> 00:33:55.210
She understood that we need to live according to Jehovah standards.

00:33:55.210 --> 00:34:00.210
As elders, we can help people to get up and get back on the path to life.

00:34:00.210 --> 00:34:02.210
And it's a real pleasure.

00:34:02.210 --> 00:34:04.210
I'm reminded about the account of David.

00:34:04.210 --> 00:34:08.210
Eventually, he was forgiven by Jehovah because he had a good heart.

00:34:08.210 --> 00:34:13.210
However, there were consequences all through his life.

00:34:13.210 --> 00:34:17.809
I received so many blessings, he's sticking to Jehovah.

00:34:17.809 --> 00:34:21.809
I found a lovely brother to marry in the Christian congregation

00:34:21.809 --> 00:34:23.809
and we're very happy together.

00:34:23.809 --> 00:34:25.809
The thing to do is just stick with Jehovah.

00:34:25.809 --> 00:34:27.809
Taste and see that Jehovah is good.

00:34:27.809 --> 00:34:34.809
When you do that, you will appreciate that there is absolutely no need to go anywhere else.

00:34:35.809 --> 00:34:39.809
Having observed what has happened to people who've left the truth

00:34:39.809 --> 00:34:44.809
and the baggage they sometimes end up carrying when they come back into the truth,

00:34:44.809 --> 00:34:46.809
it makes me feel it's just not worth it.

00:34:46.809 --> 00:34:48.809
Really, Jehovah's like a parent.

00:34:48.809 --> 00:34:50.809
He wants to protect us and care for us.

00:34:50.809 --> 00:34:54.809
Things will always work out for the best if you do things Jehovah's way.

00:34:54.809 --> 00:34:59.809
I feel my families had many blessings as a husband and a father.

00:34:59.809 --> 00:35:02.809
I've got four children who've all grown up in the truth

00:35:02.809 --> 00:35:05.809
and they've all gone on to have good theoretical lives

00:35:05.809 --> 00:35:07.809
where they've enjoyed many privileges of service.

00:35:07.809 --> 00:35:12.809
So for me, it's been a real blessing to do things Jehovah's way.

00:35:12.809 --> 00:35:17.809
Think when you test out the world, Satan will give you immediate satisfaction.

00:35:17.809 --> 00:35:21.809
But when you serve no purpose to him anymore, that's it.

00:35:21.809 --> 00:35:26.809
One of the most beautiful blessings I've received is people around you.

00:35:26.809 --> 00:35:30.809
Love Jehovah who want to serve him the way you do.

00:35:30.809 --> 00:35:36.809
I really strongly believe that Jehovah not only gives us a lot of blessings

00:35:36.809 --> 00:35:39.809
but gives us blessings that he's hand-picked for us.

00:35:39.809 --> 00:35:48.239
My observation would be experience is not the best teacher Jehovah's the best teacher.

00:35:48.239 --> 00:35:57.889
Jehovah wants us to be happy and avoid the painful consequences of bad decisions.

00:35:57.889 --> 00:36:01.889
If you're facing a test of integrity in some way,

00:36:01.889 --> 00:36:06.889
remember that as our brother said, Jehovah is our best teacher.

00:36:06.889 --> 00:36:12.889
Of course, if we're to learn from Jehovah, we have to allow him to teach us.

00:36:12.889 --> 00:36:15.889
We must let him mold us.

00:36:15.889 --> 00:36:20.889
This was the topic of a recent morning worship by Brother Gary Bro.

00:36:20.889 --> 00:36:24.889
I scripture here Isaiah 64 verse 8.

00:36:24.889 --> 00:36:30.889
It clearly establishes that Jehovah God is the potter, the great potter in fact

00:36:30.889 --> 00:36:32.889
and we are the clay.

00:36:32.889 --> 00:36:37.889
Now, in what way is he molding us?

00:36:37.889 --> 00:36:43.889
Well, one way is through adjusting our Christian personality.

00:36:43.889 --> 00:36:46.889
Now, how does he do that?

00:36:46.889 --> 00:36:56.889
Well, he uses his word the Bible, his Holy Spirit, and the Christian congregation.

00:36:56.889 --> 00:37:02.889
So what we're going to do is to talk about how Jehovah helps to mold our personality.

00:37:02.889 --> 00:37:05.889
What's the process that's used?

00:37:05.889 --> 00:37:12.889
We're going to talk about two aspects of the Christian personality, humility and kindness.

00:37:12.889 --> 00:37:20.889
So we said one way Jehovah uses to mold our personality as his word the Bible.

00:37:20.889 --> 00:37:27.889
Then Hebrews chapter 4 verse 12 says that God's word has tremendous power.

00:37:27.889 --> 00:37:32.889
So we take individual scriptures as we are reading it.

00:37:32.889 --> 00:37:35.889
We look at our own personality.

00:37:35.889 --> 00:37:37.889
What does it say about me?

00:37:37.889 --> 00:37:40.889
How can I improve?

00:37:40.889 --> 00:37:42.889
Let's take an example of humility.

00:37:42.889 --> 00:37:49.889
We're going to go to Philippians chapter 2 verses 3 and 4.

00:37:49.889 --> 00:37:52.889
We see how this is a powerful aid to us.

00:37:52.889 --> 00:37:58.889
Here's what we should do, Philippians 2, 3 and 4.

00:37:58.889 --> 00:38:07.889
Do nothing out of contentiousness or out of egotism, but with humility consider others superior to you.

00:38:07.889 --> 00:38:15.889
As you look, not only for your own interests, but also for the interests of others.

00:38:15.889 --> 00:38:22.889
So when we read the scripture, we look at ourselves and say, well, how am I doing in this?

00:38:22.889 --> 00:38:28.889
Do I see that I have made progress, especially if this has been an issue in the past?

00:38:28.889 --> 00:38:36.889
Is Jehovah somehow nudging me, adjusting me, molding me by means of this powerful scripture?

00:38:36.889 --> 00:38:39.889
Ask ourselves humility.

00:38:39.889 --> 00:38:43.889
Am I the person that always seems to be in charge?

00:38:43.889 --> 00:38:47.889
What do I give across that attitude to others?

00:38:47.889 --> 00:38:52.889
Or as it says here, do I view others as superior?

00:38:52.889 --> 00:38:58.889
Maybe even saying, I admit that that sister has more patience than I have.

00:38:58.889 --> 00:39:03.889
Or that brother is really a better teacher than I am.

00:39:03.889 --> 00:39:10.889
You see, by the means of individual scriptures, Jehovah God can help to mold our thinking.

00:39:10.889 --> 00:39:21.889
In addition to the individual scripture, the Bible also provides examples of that quality in action.

00:39:21.889 --> 00:39:28.889
And so the Watchtower comment for today uses Christ Jesus as an example in humility.

00:39:28.889 --> 00:39:35.889
So let's open to that scripture. It's referred to as Luke chapter 22.

00:39:35.889 --> 00:39:40.889
And as we read the account, we think, you know, what can I learn? How did he handle it?

00:39:40.889 --> 00:39:42.889
How can I apply it?

00:39:42.889 --> 00:39:47.889
So 22, 24, this took place the evening before his death.

00:39:47.889 --> 00:39:54.889
It says, however, there also arose a heated dispute among them over which one of them was considered to be the greatest.

00:39:54.889 --> 00:39:58.889
Well, automatically we see there's a problem of humility here.

00:39:58.889 --> 00:40:05.889
Well, so let's move down now to verses 26 and 27.

00:40:05.889 --> 00:40:19.889
He says, you though, are not to be that way, but let the one who is the greatest among you become as the youngest and the one taking the lead as the one ministering for which one is greater?

00:40:19.889 --> 00:40:25.889
The one dining or the one serving? Is it not the one dining?

00:40:25.889 --> 00:40:31.889
But I am among you as the one serving.

00:40:31.889 --> 00:40:40.889
Now, these were not just words because the apostles had seen three and a half years of beautiful example of Jesus serving others.

00:40:40.889 --> 00:40:48.889
Truly a humble man. And through our Bible reading too, we've seen this example of humility that we can apply.

00:40:48.889 --> 00:40:55.889
So it's good for us to ask ourselves, am I a proud person?

00:40:55.889 --> 00:40:59.889
Do I give off that impression to others?

00:40:59.889 --> 00:41:08.889
Do I view myself as one dining or as one serving?

00:41:08.889 --> 00:41:15.889
Well, another way that Jehovah uses to mold our Christian personality is the Holy Spirit.

00:41:15.889 --> 00:41:17.889
Now, how does that work?

00:41:17.889 --> 00:41:25.889
Well, if you look at Galatians chapter 5, in verse 19 it talks about the works of the flesh.

00:41:25.889 --> 00:41:30.889
And then in verse 22 it refers to the fruitage of the Spirit.

00:41:30.889 --> 00:41:34.889
Work to the flesh, fruitage of the Spirit.

00:41:34.889 --> 00:41:40.889
Now, work, work, it's a result of what one does.

00:41:40.889 --> 00:41:44.889
It's the product of your actions.

00:41:44.889 --> 00:42:00.889
And so the Apostle Paul list, as you see there under works of the flesh, various results that come as a result of a conscious effort on an individual's part are possibly because of human imperfection.

00:42:00.889 --> 00:42:08.889
But on the other hand, Paul talks about the fruitage of the Spirit, not work, but the fruitage it results in.

00:42:08.889 --> 00:42:20.889
And this is implying that qualities that are listed there as fruitage of the Spirit are not the result of some sort of program we get into to adjust our character.

00:42:20.889 --> 00:42:27.889
But it's the operation of God's Spirit upon the individual.

00:42:27.889 --> 00:42:38.889
It's this tremendous force and power from Jehovah God that moves us in certain ways that may be to recognize Scripture, to listen to counsel.

00:42:38.889 --> 00:42:47.889
Yes, we need to pray for his Holy Spirit so we can develop those Christian qualities that Paul mentions.

00:42:47.889 --> 00:42:52.889
So when you look at verse 22, one of those qualities is kindness.

00:42:52.889 --> 00:42:56.889
How important is that for the Christian personality?

00:42:56.889 --> 00:43:06.889
So when the great potter looks at us, does he see a need for adjustments in the way we display kindness to others?

00:43:06.889 --> 00:43:14.889
So are we praying to Jehovah God? Please, Jehovah, help me develop this fruitage of the Spirit.

00:43:14.889 --> 00:43:22.889
Here again, the Bible gives examples of individuals that had kindness.

00:43:22.889 --> 00:43:25.889
It's the quality and action, so to speak.

00:43:25.889 --> 00:43:29.889
And in this case, Jehovah God, of course, is the greatest example.

00:43:29.889 --> 00:43:39.889
Here it is. In Genesis chapter 3, it describes in verse 7 that after Adam and Eve ate the fruit, and they recognize their nakedness, so what do they do?

00:43:39.889 --> 00:43:42.889
They sow fig leaves together as clothing.

00:43:42.889 --> 00:43:51.889
But now in verse 21, before putting them out of the garden of Eden into the thorns and thistles, what did Jehovah do?

00:43:51.889 --> 00:43:57.889
What says, he made long garments out of skin to clothe them.

00:43:57.889 --> 00:44:01.889
Now that's the ultimate of kindness.

00:44:01.889 --> 00:44:10.889
See, we want to allow these examples to touch us in ways that moves us to be kind to others.

00:44:10.889 --> 00:44:16.889
Now one benefit of kindness is that people are drawn to that kind of person.

00:44:16.889 --> 00:44:24.889
Proverbs 11 verse 17 says this, a kind man benefits himself.

00:44:24.889 --> 00:44:29.889
It's enjoyable being around a kind person, isn't it?

00:44:29.889 --> 00:44:35.889
A kind person easily finds and keeps good friends.

00:44:36.889 --> 00:44:48.889
Now the ministry of school textbook says that one who is kind and mild, tempered, is gentle in his way of doing things.

00:44:48.889 --> 00:45:01.889
Now under the chapter of voice quality, here's what it says, people are greatly influenced by not only by what is said, but also by how it is said.

00:45:01.889 --> 00:45:12.889
If a person speaking to you has a voice that is pleasant, warm, friendly and kind, is it not true that you are more inclined to listen favorably?

00:45:12.889 --> 00:45:14.889
Most certainly it is.

00:45:14.889 --> 00:45:28.889
And I might say the November study edition of the Watchtower, we just received, has a beautiful article in it entitled Kindness, a quality expressed in word and action.

00:45:29.889 --> 00:45:38.889
So when it comes to our Christian personality, especially involving humility and kindness, as we've talked about today,

00:45:38.889 --> 00:45:42.889
may each of us respond to the molding of Jehovah God.

00:45:42.889 --> 00:45:47.889
He uses his word, the Bible, and he uses his Holy Spirit.

00:45:47.889 --> 00:46:03.889
Now we also said Jehovah uses the congregation, so may we all be responsive to counsel that we receive either from the platform or maybe individual counsel to improve in these areas.

00:46:03.889 --> 00:46:24.889
And if we respond correctly, then we can say, as recorded in Isaiah 648, but now, oh Jehovah, you are our Father, we are the clay, and you are our potter, we are all the work of your hand.

00:46:24.889 --> 00:46:29.889
Do you sometimes feel that your best is not good enough?

00:46:29.889 --> 00:46:33.889
As Brother Hurd said earlier, it can happen.

00:46:33.889 --> 00:46:40.889
But as our new song reminds us, we overcome these feelings by safeguarding our heart and mind.

00:47:29.780 --> 00:50:26.869
What an encouraging song for all of us. Although we saw a sister facing discouraging moments,

00:50:26.869 --> 00:50:32.869
it affects everyone. Men, couples, young ones, the elderly.

00:50:32.869 --> 00:50:37.869
Throughout our program, we saw how Jehovah teaches us through the examples of others.

00:50:37.869 --> 00:50:42.869
Philip inspires us to have the evangelizing spirit.

00:50:42.869 --> 00:50:47.869
We learned how Jehovah helps us avoid mistakes and disappointments.

00:50:48.869 --> 00:50:55.869
And we saw how Jehovah used brothers and sisters to help Eugene and Odiel through very difficult times.

00:50:55.869 --> 00:51:04.869
And our music video reminds us that safeguarding our mind and heart helps us focus on Jehovah's blessings.

00:51:04.869 --> 00:51:14.869
Before we say goodbye, let's enjoy our video postcard, which comes to us from our brothers and sisters in the Republic of Lithuania.

00:51:15.869 --> 00:51:20.869
Lithuania is a small country on the eastern edge of the Baltic Sea.

00:51:20.869 --> 00:51:28.869
The land features beautiful coastline, forests, rivers, and thousands of lakes.

00:51:28.869 --> 00:51:37.869
Castles adopt the scenery. For centuries, the Baltic Sea has washed ashore pieces of fossilized tree resin known as amber.

00:51:37.869 --> 00:51:42.869
And to this day, Lithuanian craftsmen form it into jewelry.

00:51:42.869 --> 00:51:46.869
Nearly 3,000 publishers are sharing the good news here.

00:51:46.869 --> 00:51:51.869
They conduct more than 1,800 Bible studies every month.

00:51:51.869 --> 00:51:55.869
Our brothers participate in many forms of the ministry.

00:51:55.869 --> 00:51:59.869
They enjoy the door-to-door work in cities and villages.

00:51:59.869 --> 00:52:05.119
And they're active in public witnessing throughout the country.

00:52:05.119 --> 00:52:09.119
Clipada is home to Lithuania's largest port.

00:52:09.119 --> 00:52:12.119
Crewships bring tours from many countries.

00:52:12.119 --> 00:52:23.119
In the center of the city, our brothers have set up a kiosk where people can take literature in multiple languages and watch videos on JW.org.

00:52:23.119 --> 00:52:33.119
Informal witnessing is also effective in reaching people on the shore of the Baltic Sea, in the resort town of Brixtonus, and in the city of Countess.

00:52:33.119 --> 00:52:45.460
The Karonian spit is a lush 100 kilometer or 60 miles strip of land that rests between the Baltic Sea and the Karonian lagoon.

00:52:45.460 --> 00:52:51.460
It's a popular tourist destination, and Jehovah's Witnesses are there to greet them.

00:52:51.460 --> 00:52:56.460
Our brothers enjoy getting together, who are encouraging association.

00:52:56.460 --> 00:53:02.460
They watch JW broadcasting programs, and enjoy hospitality.

00:53:02.460 --> 00:53:14.460
Favorite Lithuanian dishes include shashlik, skewered grilled meat, and cold borsup, which is made of beets and sour cream, served with hot potatoes.

00:53:14.460 --> 00:53:21.940
Our brothers and sisters in Lithuania send their warm love and greetings.

00:53:21.940 --> 00:53:26.940
Thank you, Chris. That was an encouraging program.

00:53:26.940 --> 00:53:30.940
We want you to know we love you, brothers, very much.

00:53:30.940 --> 00:53:36.940
From the World Headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses, this is JW Broadcasting.
