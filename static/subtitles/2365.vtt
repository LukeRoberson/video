00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:59.229
With so much that needs to get done in a day, every day, married couples can struggle

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:12.180
to work together.

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:31.849
This often leads to separate game plants, to truly be one flesh, a couple needs to work

00:01:31.849 --> 00:01:41.670
together as a team, and every team needs to have a goal.

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:53.370
Your goal should be to have a loving relationship, not just a lasting one.

00:01:53.370 --> 00:02:12.000
When marriage mates aren't teammates, disagreements can turn into fierce competition, to illustrate

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.599
this point.

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:22.580
Imagine arguments are like a couple playing tennis against each other.

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:30.759
Only one person can win, but if you change your mindset from thinking what do I want,

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:36.319
to what do we want, then you're thinking as a team, and you're able to overcome the

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:40.560
problem and win together.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:50.960
Once you have the team mindset, how do you work together as a team practically?

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:55.759
Ask Jehovah God for his guidance, and to bless your efforts to work together on the

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:59.680
issue at hand.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:11.469
As you pray, talk to Jehovah about your shared desire to have a happier marriage.

00:03:11.469 --> 00:03:14.270
Talk to each other.

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:18.629
Discuss your strong points, and where you're not so strong.

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:32.620
And see where you can better support your partner.

00:03:32.620 --> 00:04:04.599
We had a plan together that you can both work toward when you think what do we want instead

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:21.569
of what do I want, and you pray, discuss your roles, and make a plan.

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:33.339
You can have a happy marriage as a team.

00:04:33.339 --> 00:04:40.259
Take a moment, pause the video, and ask each other these three questions.

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:45.420
Remember, share your honest feelings, and openly express how you both feel.
