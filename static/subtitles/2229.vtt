00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:15.650
What's your turn, Dad?

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.649
Our family was contacted by Jehovah's Witnesses a few years ago.

00:00:19.649 --> 00:00:22.649
Rachel started studying first.

00:00:22.649 --> 00:00:24.649
Soon, we all joined in.

00:00:24.649 --> 00:00:30.649
For the first time, we were all learning what the Bible really teaches.

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:35.649
It wasn't long before we were sharing the truth with others.

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:39.649
Well, most of us were.

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:41.649
I knew it was the truth.

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:45.649
But I didn't know if I could live up to everything Jehovah asks.

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:54.429
What if I let everyone down?

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:59.380
What if I let Jehovah down?

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:17.680
Can you just give me one second?

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.930
A kind elder named Ben noticed I was struggling.

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.269
He took the initiative to help.

00:01:27.269 --> 00:01:32.269
He asked, what drew you to Jehovah in the first place?

00:01:32.269 --> 00:01:37.269
I guess it was learning that Jehovah isn't harsh and demanding.

00:01:37.269 --> 00:01:40.269
But he's a loving father.

00:01:40.269 --> 00:01:47.269
Ben agreed and said, when we do our best to serve Jehovah, he does the rest.

00:01:47.269 --> 00:01:52.269
He explained that Jehovah knows our limitations and doesn't expect perfection.

00:01:52.269 --> 00:01:57.269
And he's always there to help because he wants us to succeed.

00:01:57.269 --> 00:02:01.269
Then he read Isaiah 41-10,

00:02:01.269 --> 00:02:04.269
Do not be afraid for I am with you.

00:02:04.269 --> 00:02:08.270
Do not be anxious for I am your God.

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:15.460
I will fortify you.

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.460
Yes, I will help you.

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:22.460
I will really hold on to you with my right hand of righteousness.

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:31.219
I don't need to be perfect to serve Jehovah.

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:38.219
I just need to love him and trust him and heal the rest.
