00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:06.820
Welcome. Here are some highlights from the program.

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:11.820
How should we act when our Christian neutrality is put to the test?

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:18.820
Do you know where to draw the line between being a respectful observer and an active participant?

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.820
Join this family as these questions come up.

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.820
We're confronted by the neutrality issue in all aspects of life.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.820
What Bible principles should guide our thinking?

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.820
And this month's music video focuses on the unity among our brothers and sisters.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.820
As the world becomes more divided, we become more united.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:01:07.909
This is the March 2019 program of JW Broadcasting.

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:13.909
We begin by traveling to the country of Armenia, which is located in the Caucasus.

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:17.909
The region situated at the border of Europe and Asia.

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:25.909
Despite facing persecution for many years, our brothers and sisters in Armenia have remained loyal to Jehovah.

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:32.480
The story of Armenia is a story of faith.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:42.480
The faith of courageous brothers and sisters who endured mob violence, protests, and threats from those who do not know God.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:51.269
The faith of young brothers who were imprisoned because they refused to compromise their neutrality.

00:01:51.269 --> 00:01:58.099
And the faith of lawyers who defended them when they were arrested.

00:01:58.099 --> 00:02:06.379
In the early part of this period, the work operated out of the office in a local brother's home.

00:02:06.379 --> 00:02:10.379
Today, the story is much different.

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:21.379
On May 14, 2016, our brothers in Armenia were delighted to dedicate a group of new facilities to accommodate future growth.

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:37.620
A branch facility, mainly located on six floors of a local building, a new assembly hall, and also a school facility.

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:46.120
The dedication week started off with a welcome night, where many traveled long distances to attend.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.120
And some had not seen each other for a long time.

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:56.120
Well, we've never been to Armenia before, and meeting the brothers and sisters was such an experience.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.120
They gave us a really warm welcome.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.120
When I was 90, I decided no more Armenia.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:13.120
And now I'm 96 in Georgia who said, you're going to Armenia. What a blessing.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:21.120
It was amazing to see so many brothers and sisters from different countries, and we're enjoying them very, very nice time with them.

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:26.650
Thanks to Jehovah, we really enjoyed this.

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:34.650
But the spiritual gems that we all enjoyed the most were during the dedication program held at the end of the week.

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:44.650
The program was filled with reports and interviews that touched our hearts, and brothers' plane of the governing body gave the dedication talk.

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:55.650
Is it your desire to dedicate the branch facilities, the assembly hall, and the school facility to Jehovah today?

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:04.610
We could never have imagined such a thing happening five years ago.

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:12.610
And the time that we arrived at the airport, we saw the brothers holding up the JW about Ortsheim with their badges.

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:15.610
We were just so overwhelmed, so moved.

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:24.610
And I could feel as if I'm in the paradise today, because we have so many guests from different countries, and I could see their happy faces.

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:47.610
For many years to be in courts, in legal battles, for our brothers as conscientious objectors, or to go to the court for fighting a case, for just one kingdom hall, and suddenly to have branch and assembly hall and school facilities right away, that's for me it's kind of unbelievable.

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:52.610
Today is a great day for Jehovah's people in Armenia.

00:04:52.610 --> 00:05:05.269
Truly, Jehovah has seen the faithful obedience of our brothers and sisters in Armenia.

00:05:05.269 --> 00:05:13.269
We have witnessed Jehovah open the floodgates of the heavens, and actually empty out a blessing, until there is no more want.

00:05:13.269 --> 00:05:23.269
Our theme this month is Christian neutrality, what it means, what it takes, and why we choose it.

00:05:23.269 --> 00:05:32.269
What is your opinion? Where do you stand? Can one person make a difference in countering injustice?

00:05:32.269 --> 00:05:44.269
When we hear people discussing political topics, we might at first think their conversation is purely philosophical, but when injustice threatens our loved ones, it can seem personal.

00:05:45.269 --> 00:06:01.269
We expect that people will be divided over political ideology. Revelation, chapters 8 through 13, 4 told that in the last days, government would be the burning issue among mankind, and that people would feel pressured to take sides.

00:06:01.269 --> 00:06:11.269
The question each of us needs to ask himself is, how do I respond when people debate solutions to serious injustices?

00:06:11.269 --> 00:06:17.269
As Christians, we're most interested in the example of Christ.

00:06:17.269 --> 00:06:22.269
If ever there was a person who could make a difference in countering injustice, it was Jesus.

00:06:22.269 --> 00:06:38.269
He felt deep compassion for people, and with his abilities to feed the hungry, heal the sick, raise the dead, and reach hearts with his winsome words, Jesus could have exerted invincible influence in the realm of politics.

00:06:38.269 --> 00:06:50.269
He certainly had the opportunity to do so. Satan was pleased to offer him all the kingdoms of the inhabited earth in an exchange for one active worship, but Jesus wouldn't accept it.

00:06:50.269 --> 00:06:54.269
Neither did he assert that Satan had no authority to make such an offer.

00:06:54.269 --> 00:07:01.269
Later, Jesus' own countrymen tried to make him king, but he rejected that too.

00:07:01.269 --> 00:07:07.269
Later still, someone asked him whether it was lawful to pay taxes to the Roman government.

00:07:07.269 --> 00:07:18.269
Again, Jesus didn't take sides. He refused to become a world ruler, a national leader, or a political activist.

00:07:18.269 --> 00:07:27.269
Did that mean that Jesus didn't care, that he had no opinion? To the contrary, Jesus cared more deeply than we can fathom.

00:07:27.269 --> 00:07:33.269
And by treating people fairly, Jesus promoted justice at the most fundamental level.

00:07:33.269 --> 00:07:42.269
Still, his principal focus was on teaching people about the kingdom of God, which would eliminate injustice for all time.

00:07:42.269 --> 00:07:48.269
So what did Jesus indicate should be our position regarding human governments?

00:07:49.269 --> 00:07:59.269
We learn from Jesus' response to the question about Roman taxation, as recorded at Mark 12 verses 15 through 17.

00:07:59.269 --> 00:08:05.269
Bring me a denarius to look at. They brought one. And he said to them,

00:08:05.269 --> 00:08:11.269
who's image and inscription is this? They said to him, Caesars.

00:08:11.269 --> 00:08:19.269
Jesus then said, pay back Caesar's things to Caesar, but God's things to God.

00:08:19.269 --> 00:08:22.269
What are Caesar's things?

00:08:22.269 --> 00:08:32.269
At Romans chapter 13 verses 1 through 7, the Apostle Paul lists tax, tribute, fear, and honor.

00:08:32.269 --> 00:08:39.269
Notice, too, that Jesus said to pay back Caesar's things. What does that imply?

00:08:39.269 --> 00:08:45.269
That Caesar, the ruling authority of the day, had issued valuable things. Coins, for example.

00:08:45.269 --> 00:08:50.269
Thus Caesar had the right to ask for some of those coins back.

00:08:50.269 --> 00:08:57.269
This enabled the state to continue rendering necessary services. Jesus acknowledged that.

00:08:58.269 --> 00:09:03.269
On the other hand, our most valuable possessions are grants from God Himself.

00:09:03.269 --> 00:09:08.269
Such gifts as our heart, our life, our mind, and our strength.

00:09:08.269 --> 00:09:14.269
We can't give those things back to Caesar because Caesar didn't grant them to us in the first place.

00:09:14.269 --> 00:09:21.269
We rightly give those things back to God in the form of our dedication and our love.

00:09:21.269 --> 00:09:27.269
Regarding our love for God, Jesus said at Mark chapter 12 and verse 30.

00:09:27.269 --> 00:09:40.269
You must love Jehovah your God with your whole heart, and with your whole soul, and with your whole mind, and with your whole strength.

00:09:40.269 --> 00:09:49.269
So the love we give back to God is total, no bodily part, function, capacity, or desire being left out.

00:09:50.269 --> 00:09:58.269
Those who love God take the side of Jesus, whom Jehovah has appointed as King.

00:09:58.269 --> 00:10:03.269
But how would Jesus' disciples defend his kingdom when people opposed it?

00:10:03.269 --> 00:10:09.269
We gain insight from events that occurred on the last night of Jesus' life on earth.

00:10:09.269 --> 00:10:16.269
Recall from Matthew chapter 26 that when a large crowd with swords and clubs came to arrest Jesus,

00:10:16.269 --> 00:10:22.269
Peter drew his sword and struck the slave of the high priest taking off his ear.

00:10:22.269 --> 00:10:26.269
John reports that the slave's name was Malkus.

00:10:26.269 --> 00:10:30.269
Luke adds that Jesus touched the man's ear and healed him.

00:10:30.269 --> 00:10:36.269
Imagine that. Jesus bore no ill will toward the men taking him into custody.

00:10:36.269 --> 00:10:42.269
Further, according to Matthew chapter 26 verse 52, Jesus told Peter,

00:10:42.269 --> 00:10:51.269
return your sword to its place, for all those who take up the sword will perish by the sword.

00:10:51.269 --> 00:10:55.269
Why did Jesus disapprove of Peter's brave act?

00:10:55.269 --> 00:11:00.269
For the same reason that he had avoided the political process all the way up to that point?

00:11:00.269 --> 00:11:05.269
Jesus explained this when he appeared before Pontius Pilate later that night.

00:11:05.269 --> 00:11:11.269
At John chapter 18 verse 36, we read,

00:11:11.269 --> 00:11:15.269
my kingdom is no part of this world.

00:11:15.269 --> 00:11:22.269
Yes, because Jesus' kingdom is not of human origin, it doesn't need human defenses.

00:11:22.269 --> 00:11:26.269
How can we be sure that this is what Jesus meant?

00:11:26.269 --> 00:11:30.269
Look closely at the rest of John chapter 18 verse 36.

00:11:30.269 --> 00:11:36.269
If my kingdom were part of this world, my attendance would have fought,

00:11:36.269 --> 00:11:44.269
that I should not be handed over to the Jews, but as it is, my kingdom is not from this source.

00:11:44.269 --> 00:11:51.269
So as Christians, what is our position where political matters are concerned?

00:11:51.269 --> 00:11:53.269
We are neutral.

00:11:53.269 --> 00:11:57.269
Sometimes people misunderstand this few point.

00:11:57.269 --> 00:12:01.269
Some have concluded that because we don't promote one human government,

00:12:01.269 --> 00:12:04.269
that we must be promoting another human government.

00:12:04.269 --> 00:12:08.269
In the 1950s, in what is now the Republic of Congo,

00:12:08.269 --> 00:12:12.269
authorities falsely accused Jehovah's Witnesses of being Communists.

00:12:12.269 --> 00:12:17.269
But during the 1970s, when Congo adopted a Communist form of government,

00:12:17.269 --> 00:12:21.269
the new authorities found fault with us for not being Communists.

00:12:21.269 --> 00:12:28.269
Today, however, and for nearly three decades, Jehovah's Witnesses have enjoyed legal status in the Republic of Congo.

00:12:29.269 --> 00:12:34.269
And whereas some have perceived our Christian neutrality as sheer apathy,

00:12:34.269 --> 00:12:38.269
others construe our position as a threat.

00:12:38.269 --> 00:12:41.269
Let's address both of these viewpoints.

00:12:41.269 --> 00:12:47.269
First, there is a big difference between Christian neutrality and apathy.

00:12:47.269 --> 00:12:52.269
Apathy is defined as a lack of interest, enthusiasm or concern.

00:12:52.269 --> 00:12:55.269
We certainly don't lack interest in people,

00:12:55.269 --> 00:12:58.269
nor are we insensitive to their feelings.

00:12:58.269 --> 00:13:03.269
Like Jesus, we strive to alleviate people's suffering by helping them in practical ways,

00:13:03.269 --> 00:13:08.269
while teaching them about the only kingdom that can eliminate injustice.

00:13:08.269 --> 00:13:15.269
By teaching people from God's Word, we endeavor to change hearts, not political institutions.

00:13:15.269 --> 00:13:24.269
We feel this approach is realistic because mankind's main problems are not political, but moral.

00:13:24.269 --> 00:13:30.269
But why can it be said that Jehovah's Witnesses are not a threat, but rather an asset?

00:13:30.269 --> 00:13:33.269
We conscientiously obey the laws.

00:13:33.269 --> 00:13:39.269
We support our communities through volunteer service or compulsory civilian service where that exists,

00:13:39.269 --> 00:13:42.269
and we pay our taxes.

00:13:42.269 --> 00:13:46.269
It's true we don't vote for political parties or candidates,

00:13:46.269 --> 00:13:50.269
but neither do we disrupt elections or interfere with those who choose to vote.

00:13:50.269 --> 00:13:54.269
It's true we don't lobby, campaign or run for government office,

00:13:54.269 --> 00:14:01.269
but neither do we criticize those in power, undermine their policies or demonstrate for political change.

00:14:01.269 --> 00:14:07.269
It's true we won't salute a flag, but neither will we burn a flag, spit on a flag,

00:14:07.269 --> 00:14:10.269
or disparage the nation that a flag represents,

00:14:10.269 --> 00:14:16.269
even in lands where these are considered protected expressions of freedom.

00:14:16.269 --> 00:14:19.269
It's true we don't sing national anthems,

00:14:19.269 --> 00:14:25.269
but neither do we discourage others from singing, nor do we make a public spectacle of not singing.

00:14:25.269 --> 00:14:28.269
We simply don't participate.

00:14:28.269 --> 00:14:34.269
It's true we wouldn't kill people in war, but neither would we attack people at home.

00:14:34.269 --> 00:14:37.269
So while we don't promote any political position,

00:14:37.269 --> 00:14:41.269
neither do we condemn any political position, even in our heart.

00:14:41.269 --> 00:14:45.269
That is what neutrality means.

00:14:45.269 --> 00:14:48.269
We don't take sides.

00:14:48.269 --> 00:14:55.269
But what if the demands of the state conflict with the commands of Jesus?

00:14:55.269 --> 00:14:58.269
There's a Bible principle for that.

00:14:58.269 --> 00:15:02.269
Are you thinking of what it says at Acts chapter 5 verses 28 and 29

00:15:02.269 --> 00:15:07.269
that we must obey God as ruler rather than men?

00:15:07.269 --> 00:15:12.269
This is not disregard for the state, but rather reverence for God.

00:15:12.269 --> 00:15:19.269
If the state demands that we do what God forbids or refrain from doing what God commands,

00:15:19.269 --> 00:15:25.269
then we believe God would consider that an invalid request.

00:15:25.269 --> 00:15:27.269
Now one might say,

00:15:27.269 --> 00:15:32.269
I can imagine some situations where that viewpoint could get you into trouble.

00:15:32.269 --> 00:15:37.269
Jesus foretold as much at Matthew chapter 24 verse 9 where he said,

00:15:37.269 --> 00:15:42.269
You will be hated by all the nations on account of my name.

00:15:42.269 --> 00:15:45.269
More specifically at Revelation chapter 2 and verse 10,

00:15:45.269 --> 00:15:50.269
Jesus said that some of his disciples would be thrown into prison.

00:15:50.269 --> 00:15:53.269
Not all of us, but some.

00:15:53.269 --> 00:15:56.269
So we're not disappointed if we don't get thrown into prison,

00:15:56.269 --> 00:16:00.269
but neither are we discouraged if we do.

00:16:00.269 --> 00:16:03.269
Our minds turn to the thousands of brothers and sisters

00:16:03.269 --> 00:16:08.269
who have been sentenced to prison over the years for their Christian neutrality.

00:16:08.269 --> 00:16:11.269
We are proud of them. We pray for them.

00:16:11.269 --> 00:16:14.269
We know that Jehovah is pleased with them.

00:16:14.269 --> 00:16:19.269
Their endurance under trial spells victory for all of us.

00:16:19.269 --> 00:16:21.269
How so?

00:16:21.269 --> 00:16:25.269
To the congregation in Ephesus Paul wrote,

00:16:25.269 --> 00:16:31.519
I ask you not to give up on account of my tribulations in your behalf

00:16:31.519 --> 00:16:36.519
for these mean glory for you.

00:16:36.519 --> 00:16:41.519
Paul wrote these words while he himself was under house arrest in Rome.

00:16:41.519 --> 00:16:47.519
In what sense did Paul's tribulations mean glory for the Ephesians?

00:16:47.519 --> 00:16:51.519
In that his perseverance in ministering despite trials showed the congregation

00:16:51.519 --> 00:16:56.519
that the privileges they enjoyed as Christians were of the highest importance.

00:16:56.519 --> 00:17:00.519
If Paul had just given up, what would that have implied?

00:17:00.519 --> 00:17:04.519
That their faith, their ministry, and their hope in God's kingdom

00:17:04.519 --> 00:17:07.519
were not so valuable after all?

00:17:07.519 --> 00:17:10.519
Instead, Paul's endurance exalted Christianity.

00:17:10.519 --> 00:17:15.519
It demonstrated that remaining faithful is worth any sacrifice.

00:17:15.519 --> 00:17:20.519
In like manner, the endurance of our dear brothers and sisters in prison proves

00:17:20.519 --> 00:17:26.519
that their hope is alive and that the kingdom they represent is real.

00:17:26.519 --> 00:17:32.519
They have an identity as envoys, not of any human government,

00:17:32.519 --> 00:17:37.519
but of the heavenly kingdom, a kingdom that will reward them with everlasting life

00:17:37.519 --> 00:17:40.519
in a world without war.

00:17:40.519 --> 00:17:44.829
Whether we face imprisonment or not,

00:17:44.829 --> 00:17:49.829
how prepared are we to remain neutral in our day-to-day life?

00:17:49.829 --> 00:17:54.829
In this dramatization, a Christian family discovers that they need to spend

00:17:54.829 --> 00:18:00.829
more time studying about the subject of neutrality.

00:18:00.829 --> 00:18:04.829
In the kitchen, Curtis, how's your day?

00:18:04.829 --> 00:18:07.829
Always a long day, but it's nice to be at home.

00:18:07.829 --> 00:18:09.829
That smells amazing, I can't wait.

00:18:09.829 --> 00:18:12.829
Well, it'll be ready in a few minutes, but I have a surprise.

00:18:12.829 --> 00:18:15.829
So my job gave us tickets to the game this weekend,

00:18:15.829 --> 00:18:19.829
enough for all of us to go, so it's downtown.

00:18:19.829 --> 00:18:21.829
That sounded like fun.

00:18:21.829 --> 00:18:23.829
It was a sport we could enjoy watching.

00:18:23.829 --> 00:18:33.539
Collette and I hadn't been in years, and I don't think the kids had ever gone.

00:18:33.539 --> 00:18:40.019
We were all looking forward to a family night out.

00:18:40.019 --> 00:18:46.529
But, Dad, what exactly do we do during the National Anthem?

00:18:46.529 --> 00:18:49.529
Honestly, I wasn't sure.

00:18:49.529 --> 00:18:59.589
Ladies and gentlemen, would you please stand for the singing of our National Anthem?

00:19:02.589 --> 00:19:04.589
Dad, I have a question too.

00:19:04.589 --> 00:19:07.589
Will we still have to fight at my new school?

00:19:07.589 --> 00:19:08.589
That's right.

00:19:08.589 --> 00:19:11.589
The conference with her teachers was next week,

00:19:11.589 --> 00:19:13.589
and we didn't know what they do there.

00:19:13.589 --> 00:19:15.589
Okay, class nodded, everyone's here.

00:19:15.589 --> 00:19:17.589
That's all stand for the Pledge of Allegiance.

00:19:17.589 --> 00:19:23.619
Elizabeth, everything alright?

00:19:23.619 --> 00:19:27.029
Do you think I'm here?

00:19:27.029 --> 00:19:33.109
Well, tomorrow nights are family worship evening,

00:19:33.109 --> 00:19:36.109
so why don't we do a study project as a family

00:19:36.109 --> 00:19:39.109
on Christian neutrality at public events?

00:19:39.109 --> 00:19:41.109
That sounds like a good idea, Dad.

00:19:41.109 --> 00:19:42.109
I think this will be great.

00:19:42.109 --> 00:19:46.319
We'll all get a chance into our research.

00:19:46.319 --> 00:19:50.319
I asked Daniel to research Christian principles on neutrality.

00:19:50.319 --> 00:19:57.750
Collette and Elizabeth would find examples of ones who prove loyal under pressure.

00:19:57.750 --> 00:20:04.279
And for me, my job was to call Elizabeth's new school

00:20:04.279 --> 00:20:07.279
to find out if they saluted the flag or sang the anthem.

00:20:07.279 --> 00:20:10.039
Hello?

00:20:10.039 --> 00:20:11.039
Hi, Mr. Johnson.

00:20:11.039 --> 00:20:13.039
This is Curtis, Elizabeth Dad.

00:20:13.039 --> 00:20:17.769
We'd studied this topic when the kids were younger,

00:20:17.769 --> 00:20:20.769
but we needed reminders for these new challenges.

00:20:21.769 --> 00:20:25.769
The kids found some great information.

00:20:25.769 --> 00:20:28.769
Several Bible principles applied.

00:20:28.769 --> 00:20:33.769
But what Jesus said at Matthew 410 was an essential foundation.

00:20:33.769 --> 00:20:37.019
It is Jehovah your God you must worship,

00:20:37.019 --> 00:20:42.019
and it is to Him alone you must render sacred service.

00:20:42.019 --> 00:20:46.019
If we participate in a nationalistic ceremony,

00:20:46.019 --> 00:20:51.019
we're sharing in worship of something or someone other than Jehovah God.

00:20:52.019 --> 00:20:56.019
But what would help us know what to do?

00:20:56.019 --> 00:20:59.019
Elizabeth found some good examples to imitate.

00:20:59.019 --> 00:21:04.019
The account of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego was one of our favorites.

00:21:04.019 --> 00:21:08.019
When King Nebuchadnezzar ordered them to worship the gold image,

00:21:08.019 --> 00:21:12.019
they bravely stood while others bowed down.

00:21:12.019 --> 00:21:16.019
They were determined to worship only Jehovah,

00:21:16.019 --> 00:21:19.019
and he rescued them from the furnace.

00:21:19.019 --> 00:21:24.019
And there are modern day examples of courage like the Three Hebrews.

00:21:24.019 --> 00:21:28.019
Some children have had to take a stand when governments tried to force them

00:21:28.019 --> 00:21:32.019
to take part in patriotic events during wartime,

00:21:32.019 --> 00:21:35.019
when feelings of national pride ran strong.

00:21:35.019 --> 00:21:38.019
And despite legal victories in some countries,

00:21:38.019 --> 00:21:42.019
young ones today are still put to the test.

00:21:42.019 --> 00:21:46.019
We learned there was no one answer on what to do.

00:21:46.019 --> 00:21:50.019
Situations are different depending on where we live,

00:21:50.019 --> 00:21:54.019
or what a person does to show he's participating.

00:21:54.019 --> 00:21:58.019
But in every case, Christians in some way make it evident

00:21:58.019 --> 00:22:03.019
that they are respectful observers, not participants.

00:22:03.019 --> 00:22:10.019
We felt good because we had decided what we would do to be respectful but neutral,

00:22:10.019 --> 00:22:15.019
and showed Jehovah that our family worships him alone.

00:22:15.019 --> 00:22:19.019
Since the tests of our neutrality differ depending on where we live,

00:22:19.019 --> 00:22:23.019
why not do what the family in the video did?

00:22:23.019 --> 00:22:26.019
Devote a family worship evening or personal study session

00:22:26.019 --> 00:22:30.019
to researching how to avoid participating inadvertently

00:22:30.019 --> 00:22:35.390
in any activity that would violate our Christian neutrality.

00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:38.390
The subject of neutrality was highlighted in a watchtower article

00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:42.390
that we studied in the congregations in 2016.

00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:49.390
In this first episode of a new video series called Lessons from the Watchtower,

00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:53.390
note how our brothers and sisters have applied the admonition found

00:22:53.390 --> 00:23:07.910
in that very practical article.

00:23:07.910 --> 00:23:10.910
As a professor of finance, I need to be well informed.

00:23:10.910 --> 00:23:14.910
As a Christian, I also need to be well informed as do all Christians.

00:23:14.910 --> 00:23:18.910
It's difficult not to take sides in politics.

00:23:18.910 --> 00:23:22.910
It's very difficult because we are aware of the issues.

00:23:22.910 --> 00:23:25.910
I always really liked soccer ever since I was little.

00:23:25.910 --> 00:23:30.910
I lived in a poor area and soccer was what we used to do for fun.

00:23:30.910 --> 00:23:33.910
There was a journalist that I'd like to keep up with.

00:23:33.910 --> 00:23:37.910
He would point out both the good and bad on all sides of politics.

00:23:37.910 --> 00:23:42.910
But when he spoke up and pointed out only the bad side of a political party,

00:23:42.910 --> 00:23:44.910
I did not like that.

00:23:44.910 --> 00:23:48.579
I live in the downtown area of the city.

00:23:48.579 --> 00:23:52.579
There is where the largest political demonstrations take place.

00:23:52.579 --> 00:23:55.579
People from this area are really into politics.

00:23:55.579 --> 00:23:57.579
They have definite opinions.

00:23:57.579 --> 00:24:00.579
And even though I always knew that we must remain neutral,

00:24:00.579 --> 00:24:03.579
I secretly approved of the demonstrations.

00:24:03.579 --> 00:24:09.240
On the outside, I wasn't jumping up and down or cheering.

00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:14.240
But on the inside, I was saying, come on, let's win.

00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:21.240
It was all about the desire, the crowd, the pride of your team having the most victories or the most trophies.

00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:27.240
I used to rationalize saying, I was created in Jehovah's image and Jehovah is a just God.

00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:30.240
What was speaking was my sense of justice.

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:34.240
I thought neutrality was shown through actions and not through what I felt.

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:40.240
The April 2016 watchtower has interesting information regarding neutrality.

00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:45.240
Being neutral means that you do not consider yourself better than others.

00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:48.240
Because in God's sight, all people are equal.

00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:52.240
After studying the article, I realized that I needed to make changes.

00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:55.240
I was not being neutral, so I read the article again.

00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:57.240
I prayed to Jehovah.

00:24:57.240 --> 00:25:01.240
I said to him that I knew it was if he were speaking to me.

00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:05.240
The magazine really touched me deeply.

00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:09.240
I remember reading the article at least three times that evening.

00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:11.240
I was really surprised.

00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:16.240
I realized how far off I was from what God wanted me to be on the inside.

00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:21.240
The second situation mentioned in the article has to do with news reports in the media.

00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:27.240
The article even suggests that we limit our intake of the news that we watch related to politics.

00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:31.240
There was another phrase that really moved me, it said.

00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:35.240
Even if we don't march with protesters, might we be with them in spirit?

00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:37.240
Yes, I was with them.

00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:42.240
Yes, there were several phrases in that article that were written just for me.

00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:49.000
When I cut back watching so many news reports and I had to,

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:54.000
this helped me to have self-control when I spoke to others at work.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:57.000
When workmates mentioned something that was in the news,

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.000
I didn't have anything to say since I hadn't seen it.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.000
I didn't know about it.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.000
A workmate would say, did you see that so-and-so said this?

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.000
And that someone else made a statement?

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:10.000
I would say, no, I didn't see it.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.000
And that was the end of the conversation.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:17.000
The article mentions Romans 10-12, which says that Jehovah is Lord over all of us,

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:20.000
that there's no difference between Jew and Greek.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:25.000
The Jehovah, it's not important if my country has five or six titles,

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.000
or if it won or lost the World Cup.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.000
To Jehovah, all people are equal.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.000
I took a piece of paper, just a simple piece of paper,

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:39.000
and I wrote on it the four key points that the article talks about.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:43.000
Four key points that will help us to remain neutral.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:47.000
I keep it in my purse, that way I can always read it at work.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:52.880
I like watching soccer, it's fun.

00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:56.880
I still watch it on TV, I still play soccer with my friends at Bethel,

00:26:56.880 --> 00:27:00.880
but I've made an effort to change.

00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:05.880
Little by little, I've managed to put soccer in its proper place.

00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:10.880
This helps me to keep pride and nationalism from getting the best of me.

00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:14.880
I learned from this article not to express opinions about politics,

00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:17.880
that has to come from deep inside.

00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:20.880
If I'm convinced that God's kingdom is the best solution

00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:23.880
and that there's nothing that comes even close,

00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:25.880
remaining neutral will come naturally.

00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:28.880
But I can't let my guard down.

00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:31.880
I really enjoy studying articles from the Watch Tower,

00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:34.880
especially those dealing with practical matters.

00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:36.880
They help me see the Bible as if it were a mirror.

00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:38.880
It shows me where I can improve.

00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:42.880
Following Council and making the changes suggested in the article

00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:49.880
has helped me to speak with a conviction that only the kingdom can solve mankind's problems.

00:27:49.880 --> 00:28:08.769
Because our enemy Satan tries to break our integrity in many subtle ways,

00:28:08.769 --> 00:28:12.769
it's important to know ahead of time how we'll act.

00:28:12.769 --> 00:28:17.769
Actions are important, and yet they're preceded by thoughts

00:28:17.769 --> 00:28:19.769
as one young brother discovered.

00:28:20.769 --> 00:28:24.769
In this dramatization, note what Bible principal helped him

00:28:24.769 --> 00:28:26.769
to stay neutral in his heart.

00:28:26.769 --> 00:28:48.420
They are no part of the world.

00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:50.420
John 17, 16.

00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:53.420
We must remain neutral in order to be low subjects of God's kingdom.

00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:55.420
Otherwise, how could we have a clean conscience

00:28:55.420 --> 00:28:59.420
when we preach the good news that only God's kingdom can solve mankind's problems?

00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:03.420
A Satan system, near its end, we can expect the issue of neutrality

00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:05.420
to become more prominent.

00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:09.119
Okay, people, we're ready to go.

00:29:09.119 --> 00:29:12.119
Jordan, can I get you to grab the blinds, please?

00:29:28.190 --> 00:29:31.190
You feel world government should implement.

00:29:31.190 --> 00:29:35.190
Remember, it's young people like you, each of you,

00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:39.190
who must say action to solve the problems that threaten our planet.

00:29:39.190 --> 00:30:01.740
When war comes, they'll look for you and me to do the fighting.

00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:04.740
Will you speak up and tell them no? No, we won't.

00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:24.700
A special for your generation.

00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:26.700
I mean, who do you think it's going to win?

00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:29.700
Well, we believe that.

00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:34.700
That's actually a very interesting question.

00:30:34.700 --> 00:30:37.700
And as Jehovah's Witnesses, we believe that it's God's kingdom

00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:41.700
that's going to bring about all the solutions that we need for all of our problems, for example.

00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:45.940
That's 750, please. Thank you.

00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:53.170
But you know, there's no government policy.

00:30:53.170 --> 00:30:55.170
I really think it's going to work.

00:30:55.170 --> 00:30:57.170
It's crazy.

00:30:57.170 --> 00:31:00.170
With their policies, we'll be bankrupt within three years.

00:31:00.170 --> 00:31:03.170
But if it works, though, it's going to make people rich.

00:31:03.170 --> 00:31:05.170
Those are rich already.

00:31:05.170 --> 00:31:07.170
No, I'm fed up. They say the same thing.

00:31:07.170 --> 00:31:27.420
We've invited a panel of experts to explore these issues.

00:31:27.420 --> 00:31:30.420
Namely, can the opposition party win?

00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:33.420
Will they keep their promises to lower income people?

00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:37.420
And what changes could we expect on required military service?

00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:39.420
You'll want to hear the answers.

00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:43.420
Let's begin by speaking to John McCarthy, Minister of Education.

00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:47.420
If put to the test, I do want to take my stand for Jehovah.

00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:51.420
But the outcome of all these things can affect me now.

00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:55.420
My family, my goals.

00:31:55.420 --> 00:31:59.420
How can I stay neutral, even in my heart?

00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:06.579
John 17.

00:32:06.579 --> 00:32:09.579
Verse 14.

00:32:09.579 --> 00:32:13.579
I have given your word to them, but the world has hated them

00:32:13.579 --> 00:32:18.579
because they are no part of the world, just as I am no part of the world.

00:32:18.579 --> 00:32:22.579
I do not request that you take them out of the world,

00:32:22.579 --> 00:32:25.579
but that you watch over them because of the wicked one.

00:32:25.579 --> 00:32:30.579
They are no part of the world, just as I am no part of the world.

00:32:30.579 --> 00:32:32.579
Sanctify them by means of the truth.

00:32:32.579 --> 00:32:34.579
Your word is truth.

00:32:34.579 --> 00:32:39.579
Just as you sent me into the world, I also sent them into the world.

00:32:39.579 --> 00:32:42.579
And I am sanctifying myself in their behalf,

00:32:42.579 --> 00:32:47.579
so that they also may be sanctified by means of truth.

00:32:47.579 --> 00:32:51.579
No part of the world, like Jesus,

00:32:51.579 --> 00:32:54.579
both in thought and action.

00:32:54.579 --> 00:33:00.589
Sure, but in our lifetime.

00:33:00.589 --> 00:33:03.589
Yes, and I have found something that has helped me to be sure of this.

00:33:03.589 --> 00:33:05.589
Can I share it with you?

00:33:05.589 --> 00:33:08.589
It's here in Matthew 24, 33.

00:33:08.589 --> 00:33:12.589
Jesus said, likewise, also you, when you see all these things,

00:33:12.589 --> 00:33:28.029
know that he is near.

00:33:28.029 --> 00:33:33.029
Our being neutral today is urgent because Jehovah's Day is coming quickly.

00:33:33.029 --> 00:33:38.029
On that day, we must be absolutely certain that we are on Jehovah's side.

00:33:38.029 --> 00:33:41.029
In this Bethlehem morning worship,

00:33:41.029 --> 00:33:47.029
Brother Anthony Morris of the governing body explains why we don't need to worry about the events to come.

00:33:47.029 --> 00:33:52.029
Now, the watchtower from where the comments are taken

00:33:52.029 --> 00:33:57.029
had the theme, your deliverance is getting near.

00:33:57.029 --> 00:34:03.029
Now, this was a sobering and yet very encouraging watchtower study article.

00:34:03.029 --> 00:34:07.029
And that theme was taken from Luke chapter 21,

00:34:07.029 --> 00:34:12.030
so if you like to find that in Luke 21.

00:34:12.030 --> 00:34:16.030
And in the context prior to verse 28,

00:34:16.030 --> 00:34:20.030
we know verse 26 people will become faint out of fear

00:34:20.030 --> 00:34:25.030
and expectation of the things coming upon the inhabit earth.

00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:29.030
And then mentions the heavens shaken,

00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:31.030
then see the Son of Man.

00:34:31.030 --> 00:34:34.030
And that's where we find the theme verse 28.

00:34:34.030 --> 00:34:38.030
But as these things start to occur,

00:34:38.030 --> 00:34:42.030
stand up straight and lift up your heads

00:34:42.030 --> 00:34:46.030
because your deliverance is getting near.

00:34:46.030 --> 00:34:53.030
Now, as we know that is fulfilled during the great tribulation.

00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:56.030
That's something to keep in mind.

00:34:56.030 --> 00:35:00.030
That at that time when these events take place,

00:35:00.030 --> 00:35:06.030
they'll be able to stand up and look forward to the deliverance.

00:35:06.030 --> 00:35:12.030
Now, for a moment, just reflect back on the Hezekiah video

00:35:12.030 --> 00:35:17.030
that we enjoyed during the convention season last year.

00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:22.030
It was amazing and what a beautiful job that the brothers did in our video

00:35:22.030 --> 00:35:31.030
depicting one angel that destroyed 185,000 men.

00:35:31.030 --> 00:35:33.030
It was spectacular.

00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:39.030
However, find Revelation chapter 17.

00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:42.030
Revelation chapter 17.

00:35:42.030 --> 00:35:48.030
And this is what is foretold for the near future.

00:35:48.030 --> 00:35:51.030
The context here, Revelation 17,

00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:54.030
where verse 12 mentions the 10 horns,

00:35:54.030 --> 00:35:57.030
and then down into verse 13,

00:35:57.030 --> 00:35:59.030
after this one hour with the wild beast,

00:35:59.030 --> 00:36:01.030
the United Nations,

00:36:01.030 --> 00:36:03.030
and they give their authority to the wild beast.

00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:07.030
Humans in general would find that hard to believe

00:36:07.030 --> 00:36:11.030
when they look at what's going on in the world today.

00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:16.030
But here's what they're going to do in verse 14.

00:36:16.030 --> 00:36:19.030
These will battle with the Lamb,

00:36:19.030 --> 00:36:23.030
but because He is Lord of lords and king of kings,

00:36:23.030 --> 00:36:27.030
the Lamb will conquer them.

00:36:27.030 --> 00:36:34.030
Also, those with Him who are called and chosen and faithful will do so.

00:36:34.030 --> 00:36:39.030
Now, as good as our Brothers Iron Audio video,

00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:45.030
I personally doubt anyone could do a videography

00:36:45.030 --> 00:36:47.030
and capture this event.

00:36:47.030 --> 00:36:50.030
You're talking about Christ Jesus,

00:36:50.030 --> 00:36:56.030
the 144,000 anointed immortal spirit creatures,

00:36:56.030 --> 00:36:59.030
and then Jesus has the holy angels

00:36:59.030 --> 00:37:02.030
that are under His direction as king.

00:37:02.030 --> 00:37:04.030
This is going to be spectacular.

00:37:04.030 --> 00:37:06.030
Now, all things are possible with God,

00:37:06.030 --> 00:37:08.030
but I think it would have to have Him

00:37:08.030 --> 00:37:11.030
to be able to show a video

00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:15.030
to capture what's coming in the future,

00:37:15.030 --> 00:37:17.030
just spectacular.

00:37:17.030 --> 00:37:19.030
Now, just keep in mind,

00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:21.030
and the watchtower made this clear,

00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:25.030
we don't know the sure and exact sequence of events,

00:37:25.030 --> 00:37:28.030
the time order, some of it as the watchtower said,

00:37:28.030 --> 00:37:30.030
will likely overlap.

00:37:30.030 --> 00:37:33.030
However, what we do know,

00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:36.030
and Jehovah has been kind about this,

00:37:36.030 --> 00:37:38.030
is what's going to take place

00:37:38.030 --> 00:37:41.030
to start the great tribulation.

00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:44.030
Now, we find here in verse 15,

00:37:44.030 --> 00:37:48.030
and we'll read through 17 of Revelation 17.

00:37:48.030 --> 00:37:49.030
He said to me,

00:37:49.030 --> 00:37:51.030
the waters that you saw

00:37:51.030 --> 00:37:53.030
were the prostitute of sitting,

00:37:53.030 --> 00:37:57.030
mean peoples and crowds and nations and tongues.

00:37:57.030 --> 00:38:00.030
And the ten horns that you saw in the wild beasts,

00:38:00.030 --> 00:38:02.030
these will hate the prostitute,

00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:05.030
and will make her devastated and naked,

00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:07.030
and they will eat up her flesh

00:38:07.030 --> 00:38:10.030
and completely burn her with fire.

00:38:10.030 --> 00:38:15.030
Now, here's the fact and verification

00:38:15.030 --> 00:38:17.030
for why this will happen.

00:38:17.030 --> 00:38:20.030
Verse 17, for God put it into their hearts

00:38:20.030 --> 00:38:23.030
to carry out His thought.

00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:25.030
Yes, to carry out their one thought

00:38:25.030 --> 00:38:28.030
by giving their kingdom to the wild beast

00:38:28.030 --> 00:38:31.030
until the words of God will have been accomplished.

00:38:31.030 --> 00:38:34.030
So it's as good as done.

00:38:34.030 --> 00:38:36.030
This is what's going to happen,

00:38:36.030 --> 00:38:39.030
regardless of how people view us

00:38:39.030 --> 00:38:42.030
when we preach this good news,

00:38:42.030 --> 00:38:44.030
because this is good news,

00:38:44.030 --> 00:38:47.030
the destruction of the world-empowerful religion,

00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:49.030
the beginning of the great tribulation.

00:38:49.030 --> 00:38:52.030
This is spectacular news for God's people,

00:38:52.030 --> 00:38:55.030
and until it takes place,

00:38:55.030 --> 00:38:57.030
they won't believe it.

00:38:57.030 --> 00:38:58.030
But it will happen,

00:38:58.030 --> 00:39:00.030
because Jehovah says it's going to happen.

00:39:00.030 --> 00:39:02.030
So that'll be a time for us

00:39:02.030 --> 00:39:05.030
to prove our love for Jehovah God

00:39:05.030 --> 00:39:09.030
will be the only group protected by Him.

00:39:09.030 --> 00:39:11.030
Now, this was profound too.

00:39:11.030 --> 00:39:13.030
This article in the Watchtower

00:39:13.030 --> 00:39:15.030
made this, I thought,

00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:17.030
was a profound statement when you think about

00:39:17.030 --> 00:39:20.030
the organization we're part of.

00:39:20.030 --> 00:39:23.030
It said in paragraph 9,

00:39:23.030 --> 00:39:26.030
this will not be the time

00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:29.030
to preach the good news of the kingdom.

00:39:29.030 --> 00:39:32.030
We're preaching a organization,

00:39:32.030 --> 00:39:35.030
so there's a time we'll not preach the good news.

00:39:35.030 --> 00:39:37.030
Yes.

00:39:37.030 --> 00:39:40.030
Remember one of our favorite verses,

00:39:40.030 --> 00:39:43.030
it's etched on the minds and hearts of God's people,

00:39:43.030 --> 00:39:45.030
and this good news of the kingdom

00:39:45.030 --> 00:39:47.030
be preached in all the inhabited earth

00:39:47.030 --> 00:39:49.030
for a witness to all the nations.

00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:52.030
Well, don't forget the last part,

00:39:52.030 --> 00:39:55.030
and then the end will come.

00:39:55.030 --> 00:39:58.030
So during the great tribulation,

00:39:58.030 --> 00:40:01.030
no good news.

00:40:01.030 --> 00:40:05.030
However, we do know there'll be preaching,

00:40:05.030 --> 00:40:09.030
and you think we're unpopular now?

00:40:09.030 --> 00:40:12.030
Oh, my.

00:40:12.030 --> 00:40:14.030
Notice Revelation 16,

00:40:14.030 --> 00:40:18.030
and in the context Armageddon is being addressed,

00:40:18.030 --> 00:40:22.030
and Notice verse 21,

00:40:22.030 --> 00:40:24.030
then great hailstones,

00:40:24.030 --> 00:40:26.030
each about the weight of a talent,

00:40:26.030 --> 00:40:29.030
fell from heaven on the people,

00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:31.030
and the people blaspheme God

00:40:31.030 --> 00:40:34.030
because of the plague of the hill,

00:40:34.030 --> 00:40:37.030
for the plague was unusually great.

00:40:37.030 --> 00:40:39.030
Yes.

00:40:39.030 --> 00:40:42.030
So the message in the preaching

00:40:42.030 --> 00:40:45.030
is going to be like hailstones.

00:40:45.030 --> 00:40:47.030
I don't know if you've ever been in a hailstone,

00:40:47.030 --> 00:40:51.030
but this is a huge hailstone

00:40:51.030 --> 00:40:53.030
being depicted here,

00:40:53.030 --> 00:40:57.030
likely possibly a hard-hitting message,

00:40:57.030 --> 00:40:59.030
maybe a declaration announcing

00:40:59.030 --> 00:41:04.030
that Satan's world is about to come to a complete end.

00:41:04.030 --> 00:41:08.030
So let's just stay tuned,

00:41:08.030 --> 00:41:11.030
and don't feel bad.

00:41:11.030 --> 00:41:13.030
I know I was out in the ministry

00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:17.030
in one territory recently,

00:41:17.030 --> 00:41:20.030
and it's good to suffer reproach.

00:41:20.030 --> 00:41:22.030
We all need that, like Jesus did.

00:41:22.030 --> 00:41:25.030
The Lord adores good for us.

00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:28.030
See, if you think we're suffering reproach now,

00:41:28.030 --> 00:41:30.030
well, get ready.

00:41:30.030 --> 00:41:33.030
It's just training for this future declaration

00:41:33.030 --> 00:41:36.030
that we don't have the privilege to share in.

00:41:36.030 --> 00:41:38.030
Now, keep in mind,

00:41:38.030 --> 00:41:41.030
there is this event that the watch tower

00:41:41.030 --> 00:41:44.030
did mention in Matthew chapter 24,

00:41:44.030 --> 00:41:46.030
and if you'll find that,

00:41:46.030 --> 00:41:49.030
and it's nice to have this clear

00:41:49.030 --> 00:41:52.030
Matthew chapter 24,

00:41:52.030 --> 00:41:58.030
and we're going to read verse 31,

00:41:58.030 --> 00:42:02.030
and he will send out his angels

00:42:02.030 --> 00:42:04.030
with a great trumpet sound,

00:42:04.030 --> 00:42:06.030
and they will gather his chosen ones

00:42:06.030 --> 00:42:09.030
together from the four winds,

00:42:09.030 --> 00:42:11.030
from one extremity of the heavens

00:42:11.030 --> 00:42:14.030
to their other extremity.

00:42:14.030 --> 00:42:16.030
So with the watch tower stated,

00:42:16.030 --> 00:42:18.030
it's not the initial gathering

00:42:18.030 --> 00:42:20.030
of the anointed or the final ceiling.

00:42:20.030 --> 00:42:22.030
This is when the remnant,

00:42:22.030 --> 00:42:25.030
the remaining ones receive their heavenly reward

00:42:25.030 --> 00:42:27.030
during the great tribulation,

00:42:27.030 --> 00:42:30.030
and this event takes place at some point

00:42:30.030 --> 00:42:34.030
after the beginning of the attack of God.

00:42:34.030 --> 00:42:36.030
Now, at that time,

00:42:36.030 --> 00:42:39.030
that's when Matthew 1343 is fulfilled.

00:42:39.030 --> 00:42:42.030
The righteous ones will shine as brightly

00:42:42.030 --> 00:42:47.030
as the sun and the kingdom of their father.

00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:48.030
So as we mentioned,

00:42:48.030 --> 00:42:50.030
sobering, yes,

00:42:50.030 --> 00:42:52.030
but encouraging, oh, yes,

00:42:52.030 --> 00:42:53.030
so encouraging.

00:42:53.030 --> 00:42:56.030
So brothers, let's be confident.

00:42:56.030 --> 00:42:58.030
Let's trust in Jehovah.

00:42:58.030 --> 00:43:01.030
There's no need to be afraid.

00:43:01.030 --> 00:43:04.030
Let's keep up our spiritual routine

00:43:04.030 --> 00:43:07.030
and prove ourselves ready

00:43:07.030 --> 00:43:11.030
because the great tribulation is near.

00:43:11.030 --> 00:43:13.030
When Jehovah's Day comes,

00:43:13.030 --> 00:43:15.030
our brotherhood will be safe

00:43:15.030 --> 00:43:17.030
because it's united.

00:43:17.030 --> 00:43:19.030
Our worldwide unity

00:43:19.030 --> 00:43:21.030
is but one of the blessings

00:43:21.030 --> 00:43:24.030
that result from our Christian neutrality.

00:43:24.030 --> 00:43:26.030
In this month's music video,

00:43:26.030 --> 00:43:27.030
notice the connection

00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:29.030
between the love we enjoy

00:43:29.030 --> 00:43:30.030
as God's people

00:43:30.030 --> 00:43:34.030
and our being no part of this world.

00:43:34.030 --> 00:43:36.030
The song is entitled,

00:43:36.030 --> 00:43:38.030
we are one.

00:43:38.030 --> 00:43:52.579
The Shabbar into unity,

00:43:52.579 --> 00:44:07.260
there's people suffering,

00:44:07.260 --> 00:44:09.260
fighting for change,

00:44:09.260 --> 00:44:12.260
but among God's people,

00:44:12.260 --> 00:44:14.260
we trust His name,

00:44:14.260 --> 00:44:20.340
we must close to His Word,

00:44:20.340 --> 00:45:01.179
and remain to see,

00:45:01.179 --> 00:45:10.420
yes, there are anxieties,

00:45:10.420 --> 00:45:12.420
but hope is real,

00:45:12.420 --> 00:47:18.329
that's to come.

00:47:18.329 --> 00:47:20.329
The song was initially written

00:47:20.329 --> 00:47:21.329
in the Lingala language.

00:47:21.329 --> 00:47:23.329
An African language spoken mainly

00:47:23.329 --> 00:47:25.329
in the Democratic Republic of Congo

00:47:25.329 --> 00:47:27.329
and the Republic of Congo.

00:47:27.329 --> 00:47:29.329
If you'd like to hear the song

00:47:29.329 --> 00:47:30.329
in the Lingala language,

00:47:30.329 --> 00:47:32.329
you can now find it on video on demand,

00:47:32.329 --> 00:47:35.329
under the heading music.

00:47:35.329 --> 00:47:36.329
While you're at it,

00:47:36.329 --> 00:47:38.329
why not listen to other original songs

00:47:38.329 --> 00:47:40.329
in different languages?

00:47:40.329 --> 00:47:41.329
After you have navigated

00:47:41.329 --> 00:47:43.329
to the music section,

00:47:43.329 --> 00:47:45.329
change the language of the website

00:47:45.329 --> 00:47:46.329
in the top right corner,

00:47:46.329 --> 00:47:48.329
to a language of your choice.

00:47:48.329 --> 00:47:52.409
Have you noticed the many examples

00:47:52.409 --> 00:47:54.409
of Christian neutrality

00:47:54.409 --> 00:47:56.409
we've seen during this program?

00:47:56.409 --> 00:47:58.409
First, we visited Armenia,

00:47:58.409 --> 00:48:00.409
and learned how they've remained

00:48:00.409 --> 00:48:03.409
neutral despite persecution.

00:48:03.409 --> 00:48:04.409
After the talk,

00:48:04.409 --> 00:48:06.409
we learned the importance

00:48:06.409 --> 00:48:09.409
of remaining neutral at public events.

00:48:09.409 --> 00:48:11.409
Next, we met a number of brothers

00:48:11.409 --> 00:48:13.409
and sisters who shared their experiences

00:48:13.409 --> 00:48:15.409
in applying the Watchtower study article

00:48:15.409 --> 00:48:17.409
about neutrality.

00:48:17.409 --> 00:48:19.409
Brother Morris reminded us

00:48:19.409 --> 00:48:21.409
of Jehovah's protection

00:48:21.409 --> 00:48:23.409
when Jehovah judges this world.

00:48:23.409 --> 00:48:25.409
And our music video

00:48:25.409 --> 00:48:27.409
encouraged us to enjoy

00:48:27.409 --> 00:48:29.409
the blessings of unity

00:48:29.409 --> 00:48:33.409
that result from our Christian neutrality.

00:48:33.409 --> 00:48:35.409
And speaking of the music video,

00:48:35.409 --> 00:48:37.409
did you notice how our friends

00:48:37.409 --> 00:48:39.409
watched the broadcast

00:48:39.409 --> 00:48:41.409
and when the postcard came up

00:48:41.409 --> 00:48:43.409
at the end of the program,

00:48:43.409 --> 00:48:45.409
they waived back?

00:48:45.409 --> 00:48:47.409
Have you ever felt like doing that?

00:48:47.409 --> 00:48:49.409
Well, here's another opportunity.

00:48:49.409 --> 00:48:51.409
Let's visit our brothers

00:48:51.409 --> 00:48:53.409
and sisters in South Korea.

00:48:53.409 --> 00:48:55.409
Kingdom proclaimers

00:48:55.409 --> 00:48:58.409
arrived in Korea in 1912.

00:48:58.409 --> 00:49:00.409
Today, the Republic of Korea

00:49:00.409 --> 00:49:03.409
has some 1,300 congregations

00:49:03.409 --> 00:49:06.409
with over 100,000 publishers.

00:49:06.409 --> 00:49:08.409
Although the peninsula

00:49:08.409 --> 00:49:10.409
was under colonial rule for some time

00:49:10.409 --> 00:49:11.409
and has been involved

00:49:11.409 --> 00:49:13.409
in other military conflicts,

00:49:13.409 --> 00:49:15.409
Jehovah's Witnesses there

00:49:15.409 --> 00:49:18.409
have maintained their Christian neutrality,

00:49:18.409 --> 00:49:20.409
not taking sides.

00:49:20.409 --> 00:49:22.409
Over the last seven decades,

00:49:22.409 --> 00:49:24.409
more than 19,000 brothers

00:49:24.409 --> 00:49:27.409
have been imprisoned for their faith.

00:49:27.409 --> 00:49:30.409
In 2018, a favorable court decision

00:49:30.409 --> 00:49:32.409
was handed down in behalf

00:49:32.409 --> 00:49:34.409
of these faithful brothers.

00:49:34.409 --> 00:49:35.409
In the future,

00:49:35.409 --> 00:49:37.409
we look forward to even further relief

00:49:37.409 --> 00:49:41.409
from fair-minded officials in this country.

00:49:41.409 --> 00:49:44.409
This is the Kansang congregation.

00:49:44.409 --> 00:49:46.409
Their territory has a population

00:49:46.409 --> 00:49:49.409
of approximately 23,000

00:49:49.409 --> 00:49:50.409
and is partially located

00:49:50.409 --> 00:49:52.409
in the demilitarized zone

00:49:52.409 --> 00:49:54.409
near the North Korean border.

00:49:54.409 --> 00:49:55.409
It's not uncommon

00:49:55.409 --> 00:49:57.409
for the almost 50 publishers

00:49:57.409 --> 00:50:01.409
to conduct over 60 Bible studies each month.

00:50:01.409 --> 00:50:03.409
In fact, some 30 publishers

00:50:03.409 --> 00:50:06.409
or 60% of the congregation

00:50:06.409 --> 00:50:10.409
serve as regular pioneers.

00:50:10.409 --> 00:50:11.409
Due to its location,

00:50:11.409 --> 00:50:12.409
many of the residents

00:50:12.409 --> 00:50:14.409
of the villages in this area

00:50:14.409 --> 00:50:17.409
are isolated from the rest of the country.

00:50:17.409 --> 00:50:18.409
Our brothers and sisters

00:50:18.409 --> 00:50:19.409
often meet people

00:50:19.409 --> 00:50:22.409
who work for the military.

00:50:22.409 --> 00:50:24.409
Because of the congregation's proximity

00:50:24.409 --> 00:50:25.409
to the border,

00:50:25.409 --> 00:50:27.409
busloads of tourists

00:50:27.409 --> 00:50:28.409
come on a regular basis

00:50:28.409 --> 00:50:31.409
to see the North Korean border.

00:50:31.409 --> 00:50:32.409
To reach such visitors

00:50:32.409 --> 00:50:34.409
with the good news,

00:50:34.409 --> 00:50:35.409
our brothers have organized

00:50:35.409 --> 00:50:37.409
public witnessing stands

00:50:37.409 --> 00:50:39.409
in a number of locations.

00:50:39.409 --> 00:50:41.409
We love our brothers and sisters

00:50:41.409 --> 00:50:44.409
in the Kansang congregation very much,

00:50:44.409 --> 00:50:46.409
and they send their love

00:50:46.409 --> 00:50:49.409
to all of us around the world.

00:50:49.409 --> 00:50:51.409
This is JW Broadcasting

00:50:51.409 --> 00:50:53.409
from the World Headquarters

00:50:53.409 --> 00:50:55.409
of Jehovah's Witnesses.
