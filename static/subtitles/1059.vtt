00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:06.540
Do you have relatives that are presently not serving Jehovah?

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.339
I think most of us do, and we're not alone.

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:14.140
Even our Lord Jesus had that same circumstance.

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:19.140
Even though His half-brothers knew about the miracles He was performing,

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:26.640
the Bible says that they were not expressing faith in Jesus as the Messiah.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:32.340
Well, it was so bad, can you imagine, that when Jesus was being put to death,

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.939
it appears that His brothers were not there.

00:00:34.939 --> 00:00:38.939
Do you remember the account where Jesus was on the torture stake

00:00:38.939 --> 00:00:43.439
and He looked down at the disciple and asked Him, basically,

00:00:43.439 --> 00:00:46.340
to become responsible for His mother?

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.740
They weren't there to support Him.

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:55.740
But what happened just a short while after Jesus had been resurrected?

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:01.039
Well, it was amazing because some of those half-brothers were found,

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:06.239
along with Jesus' mother, with the disciples fervently praying.

00:01:06.239 --> 00:01:09.040
Can you imagine how Jesus must have felt?

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:16.340
Can you imagine the joy He must have experienced to see them now beginning to express faith?

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.540
Well, maybe you've had that experience, too.

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.540
Maybe one of your relatives, maybe your mate, one of your children,

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.640
one of your siblings, has now come to serve Jehovah.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:33.439
How wonderful, what a joyful feeling, really nothing could compare to it.

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:39.739
Well, what was it that helped Jesus' half-brothers to go from being faithless

00:01:39.739 --> 00:01:41.540
to putting faith in Him?

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.640
And what can you and I learn from that example?

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.640
Well, let's address that question.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.640
What was it that helped Jesus' brothers to acquire faith?

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.439
Well, here's the number one thing.

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.840
Jesus was patient with His relatives.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:05.640
Now, that's an important point because look at how Jesus was treated by His relatives.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:11.039
Would you look with me at Mark chapter 3 and verse 21?

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.639
It says there, but when His relatives heard about it,

00:02:15.639 --> 00:02:22.840
they went out to seize Him, for they were saying He has gone out of His mind.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.840
Jesus did not take offense, even though His relatives were trying to seize Him,

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.139
even though they said He had gone crazy.

00:02:31.139 --> 00:02:35.340
Have your relatives perhaps said some things like that to you?

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.639
Jesus did not take offense, He was patient.

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:44.439
Well, in fact, after His resurrection, look what Jesus did.

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:49.939
Let's go to 1 Corinthians chapter 15 and let's read together verse 7.

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:57.639
It says, after that, He appeared to James, then to all the apostles.

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:02.039
Now, this is just a very small detail, but did you notice what it said?

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:05.340
So Jesus appeared to James.

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.539
Well, now, we don't know what Jesus said to James when He appeared to him,

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:18.340
but the point is that Jesus made a special effort to appear to His half-brother James.

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:24.139
Well, James must have deeply appreciated that special attention from Jesus.

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:25.939
And why do we say that?

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:33.539
Well, Jesus, excuse me, James went on to become a respected elder in the congregation in Jerusalem.

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:37.139
In fact, you may remember that in Acts chapter 15,

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:43.439
when the apostles and older men gathered in Jerusalem to consider the matter about circumcision,

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:48.840
it seems that James was the one who was presiding at that meeting.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.039
Well, what had happened?

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:58.840
James had gone from being a faithless person to now being a pillar in the congregation.

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:05.039
James and his other half-brother Jude both had the privilege of writing letters

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:09.340
that were included in the Christian Greek scriptures.

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:22.139
When I'm in the following video, please take careful note of what helped a family member to be a person with faith.

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:25.639
The truth came to our home through my mother.

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:29.339
I was never seriously interested in the truth.

00:04:29.339 --> 00:04:32.839
Where we grew up, education was very important.

00:04:32.839 --> 00:04:37.339
My person needed to make money and live a lavish life.

00:04:37.339 --> 00:04:45.139
So that's the life I chose to study, to get higher education so that I could have what others had.

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:51.839
Although they could see that I wasn't interested in the truth, my mother and brother did not give up on me.

00:04:51.839 --> 00:04:59.339
When I came back from school in January, my mother ordered the examining the scriptures daily booklet for me.

00:04:59.339 --> 00:05:06.339
The year after year, I always had the examining the scriptures daily booklet and the Bible.

00:05:06.339 --> 00:05:13.350
She made sure that although I wasn't attending meetings, at least I had literature.

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:21.850
Besides that, my younger brother, the one I was close to, decided to take the truth seriously.

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:26.850
When I came back from school, I saw my brother getting a Bible study of his own.

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:32.850
And I was surprised to see him studying the Bible and noticed that he had prepared.

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:36.850
He cared about and loved what he was learning.

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:41.850
That's when I understood that the Bible changes lives.

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:48.850
A scripture that comes to mind is Hosea 11 verse 4.

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:54.850
There it shows that Jehovah pulls us with cords of love and kindness.

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:58.850
In my situation, Jehovah did this.

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:03.850
So I made the decision to be regular at the congregation meetings.

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:10.850
And I finally started studying the Bible with someone in 2007 and got baptized in 2008.

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:15.850
My family really encouraged me. They never gave up on me.

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:19.850
And I encouraged parents not to give up on their children.

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:31.100
They must continue encouraging them and have the hope that Jehovah God will draw them to the organization because they have good hearts.

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:40.230
Well, brothers and sisters, we want that same experience for our relatives.

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:45.230
What can we do to help them to grow in faith?

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:50.230
Well, let's talk briefly about three things. Here's the first one.

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:54.230
Be patient with your relatives.

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:58.230
We want to imitate the example of our wonderful God, Jehovah.

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:03.230
Do you remember when the nation of Israel went to stray so many times?

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:11.230
Well, in Jeremiah chapter 44, the Bible says that Jehovah sent his prophets again and again.

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:15.230
He was very patient with his people.

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:20.230
We want to be patient with our relatives too. Don't give up on them.

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:24.230
And then second, we want to be tactful.

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:29.230
We want to look for ways that we can stimulate their interest in the truth.

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:36.230
It's true. Jesus described the message of the truth like water that could lead to everlasting life.

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:40.230
But have you ever tried to drink from a fire hydrant?

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:43.230
That's a very difficult thing to do.

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:53.230
We don't want our relatives to choke because we're forcing too much information or with too much force or power.

00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:59.230
Instead, we want our relatives to feel refreshed by the truth.

00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:08.230
Well, whether our relatives feel choked or refreshed will really depend on how we go about explaining the truth to them.

00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:15.230
So be tactful and speak to them in a loving way that will stimulate their interest.

00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:18.230
Let's go to that third point.

00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:24.230
We want to show empathy to our relatives and let our conduct speak for us.

00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:33.230
You know, when we first learn the truth, our relatives may not be sure of how now this is going to affect our relationship with them.

00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:46.230
Instead of thinking of many, many different things that we could say, it's important to remember that what we do is going to speak far more loudly than the things that we say.

00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:53.230
You know there's a saying that says, I'd rather see a sermon than hear one, isn't that true?

00:08:53.230 --> 00:09:01.230
One sister named Pauline realized that instead of talking to her husband so much about the truth, she needed to set a good example.

00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:14.230
Well, when her husband observed the good effect that the Bible was having on his wife and on his children, that was the thing that opened his mind and opened his heart to the message of the good news.

00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:22.230
You just don't know, brothers and sisters, the good effect of your conduct, of your example, on your relatives.

00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:30.230
You know, about two years ago I was out in California at a regional convention, and a sister came up to me with two brothers.

00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:40.230
Now, she had been raised by her faithful mother in the truth, but she had gone away from the truth for more than 30 years.

00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:44.230
She watched a broadcast, and she was moved to return.

00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:50.230
She then reached out to her brother, who was also away from the truth for more than 30 years.

00:09:50.230 --> 00:10:00.230
He decided to come back too, and then the two of them reached out to their other brother, who was also away from more than 30 years, and he also came back.

00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:03.230
Here are the three of them were in front of me.

00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:08.230
Well, the sister said, I think my mother is going to have to be resurrected twice.

00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:12.230
We were all out of the truth when she died.

00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:19.230
When she sees us in the new world, she'll be so shocked I'm sure she'll need to be resurrected again.

00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:22.230
What's the point?

00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:29.230
The good example of their mother stayed with them even long after their mother had passed away.

00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:35.230
Brothers and sisters, Jehovah can use you to help your relatives.

00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:42.230
They might be faithless right now, but with your help they can become full of faith.

00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:47.230
It worked in the case of Jesus, and it can work for you too.

00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:54.230
Now, brother Ralph Walls, a helper to the personnel committee, will consider the next talk of this symposium.

00:10:54.230 --> 00:11:00.230
Remember, faithless people can acquire faith, prominent ones.
