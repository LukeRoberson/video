00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:05.809
Are you making full use of JW Library?

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:09.810
Let's learn how summer using it and then practice together.

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:13.810
I create notes in my Bible for many different reasons.

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:15.810
It could be a good point from a talk.

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:19.809
An illustration to help me explain something to a Bible student

00:00:19.809 --> 00:00:22.809
or something from my own meditation.

00:00:22.809 --> 00:00:26.809
I highlight the key phrase and create a note.

00:00:26.809 --> 00:00:28.809
Let's practice together.

00:00:28.809 --> 00:00:35.810
If you have JW Library, find 1 Timothy 2 verse 6 in the Bible.

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:42.810
Now highlight the word ransom and tap the add a note button.

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:48.210
Then type your comment.

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:56.439
Tapping the note marker in the margin brings your comment into view.

00:00:56.439 --> 00:00:59.439
I've created a lot of notes.

00:00:59.439 --> 00:01:02.439
I use tags to help me find them again.

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:06.439
For example, whenever I hear a point that I want to use in the ministry,

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:13.439
I create a note and add a tag like prayer, ransom or last days.

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.439
Then when I'm in the ministry, I can quickly find my note.

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:20.439
Let's practice together.

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:29.230
On the note you just created, tap the three dots and then edit.

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:37.439
Now tap the button, add a tag and enter a tag name.

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.439
In this case, type ransom.

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:46.959
You can add as many tags as you like.

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:56.099
To find your notes again, go to the personal study tab.

00:01:56.099 --> 00:02:01.099
You can type in the search box or you can just tap the tag.

00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:04.099
As I read the Bible chapters for the midweek meeting,

00:02:04.099 --> 00:02:08.099
I often come across verses that I want to understand better.

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.099
So I check the research guide.

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:14.099
Sometimes I use the points I find in a comment at the meeting.

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:16.099
Let's practice together.

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:20.099
Are you still at first Timothy chapter 2?

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:23.099
Tap on the number for verse 6.

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:29.080
Then tap the research guide button on the menu.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:35.490
Now you can read information that explains this verse.

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:40.490
You can even copy a portion of the research and paste it into your note.
