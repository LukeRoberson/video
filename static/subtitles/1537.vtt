An important aspect of keeping the family spiritual health intact is by making full use of the family worship arrangement.

00:00:11.359 --> 00:00:20.359
In this dramatization, pay attention to how the family head is aware of the needs of the family and how he plans accordingly.

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:23.359
Hi, my name is Joe.

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:27.359
A few weeks ago we all sat together for supper.

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.359
I was so tired and my wife Jenny felt the same way.

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:39.359
She always does it all, taking care of the children so well, but it was not easy for her in recent weeks.

00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:45.359
Sarah felt that we are too restrictive on how she dresses. She just does not understand.

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:52.359
It was hard to convince her, and to motivate her to share in the field service is becoming a challenge.

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:57.359
It was not always like this, she used to enjoy going out in field service.

00:00:57.359 --> 00:01:05.359
And Tom, he is such a good boy, but all of a sudden he was raving about the games his classmates have on their phones.

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:12.359
It's always about having supernatural powers, and it fascinated him even though he is small.

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:18.359
But when I asked him to take out the garbage, suddenly his superpowers left him.

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:29.670
And Mike, our smallest, it was hard to get him to go to bed or clean up his room.

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.670
I realized there are a few things we need to speak about.

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.670
Joe came to me and we talked a lot about our children that same evening.

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:46.670
We wondered what would be the best for them. We prayed together. Then we had an idea.

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:55.939
The following day we asked our children if we can consider Noah as the theme for our next family worship.

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:01.939
All of us liked the idea. Each one of us should prepare something.

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:17.060
Mike, Tom and I wanted to build the ark, and of course we need the animals.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:26.219
And Sarah should collect pictures for this story from our publications.

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:32.219
I also had to take time to think again about the story of Noah and how it can help our family.

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:37.219
Jenny and Sarah were responsible for the wardrobe and food.

00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:43.219
While preparing, I got the chance to speak with Sarah about her dress in a more relaxed setting.

00:02:43.219 --> 00:02:52.400
She understood that, like Noah, when it comes to Jehovah's commands, we need to do just so.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:58.400
Then the evening arrived. We talked about how it was before the flood.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:05.400
And what kind of world Noah and his family lived in. Noah's family needed real courage to preach.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:11.400
They had to explain about the rain and how the ark would be needed to survive the flood.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:18.400
Something that had never happened before. All the people thought they were crazy.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:27.400
And while we were talking about this, it came out that Sarah felt embarrassed when she met a schoolmate in the field service recently.

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:34.400
I realized Noah must have felt the same as me. And yet he was so courageous.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.400
Dad read Genesis 6 verse 9. Noah walked with the true God.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:46.400
So he could have every confidence in his friend Jehovah. I want to be just like that.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.400
For Tom, I found a great picture.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:56.400
Dad told us that the world at this time was very bad. People were fighting and many were afraid.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:02.400
And that is why Jehovah brought the flood. It made me think about the games from my schoolmates.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:09.400
I like to play those games, but I know that Jehovah does not like that. So why do I?

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.780
And the best part was when we got inside the ark.

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:22.779
Then I read Genesis 6.19 and bring into the ark two of every sort of living creature.

00:04:22.779 --> 00:04:26.779
Dad showed us that the animals went into the ark.

00:04:26.779 --> 00:04:34.310
Each one had its own place and they went inside two at a time without any chaos.

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:41.310
I explained that we also need to keep our rooms clean like the ark. I saw that Mike got the point.

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:50.850
We wanted to keep in mind Genesis 6.22 and Noah did according to all that God had commanded him.

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:52.850
He did just so.

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:59.930
And then the rain came, but we survived. That was great.

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:06.930
We all realized Noah also must have been tired sometimes, but he never gave up.

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:10.930
This was a good lesson for us.

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:21.810
We must take care of our family as Noah did also by having a regular family worship like this.

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:27.810
That example really showed many of the great benefits of family worship.

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:32.810
In addition to the obvious coming together to learn more about our Heavenly Father,

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:40.810
we saw how family worship gave the daughter an opportunity to open up about matters that had been bothering her.

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:47.810
And thanks to the good work of the parents, all of the children learned something they could apply in their daily lives.
