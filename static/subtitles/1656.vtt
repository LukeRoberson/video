00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:30.710
When you're a little, you just want to be happy, but sadly, my father had a problem with alcohol and no child wants to live through that.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:41.329
One day, my family from the United States came to visit us. They looked so happy.

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:50.929
The way they talked it was as though they only had fun, a good life, no economic problems.

00:00:50.929 --> 00:00:59.929
I was shocked. I asked myself, how can we live in such poverty while their life is so great? That was the life I wanted for my family.

00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:20.769
So, when I was nine years old, I left my mother and the rest of my family to cross the border into the United States.

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:31.180
I lived in a pretty rough neighborhood, so I joined a local gym to learn how to defend myself.

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:38.060
The trainer, Leo, he was like a father to me.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:45.859
He always tried to give us good advice. Raymond was part of the boxing team.

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:52.859
He was a good friend. We got along really well. He respected me and he looked after me.

00:01:53.859 --> 00:02:00.859
After several years of being around Raymond and the other members of the team, I felt really comfortable.

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:08.860
To some extent, I admired him because I could see he was really doing well because Raymond was selling drugs.

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:16.860
I knew that it wasn't right. But in time, I began to sell drugs as well.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:25.379
Raymond was in a drug deal going wrong where he was murdered.

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:36.009
I said to myself, this could happen to me too. It had been six years since I had seen my mom and my siblings.

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:55.259
My mother was studying the Bible with Jehovah's Witnesses. It helped her cope with a lot of suffering.

00:02:55.259 --> 00:03:01.259
It brought her peace. She was so happy.

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:06.259
I began to realize that this was what I really needed.

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:09.259
I also thought about my friends at the gym.

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:14.259
I wanted them to understand why life was so hard for all of us.

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:21.259
So I returned to the United States. But they weren't interested.

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:26.259
My trainer, Leo, told me I didn't need to sell drugs anymore.

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:31.259
He could make me a professional boxer and I could help out my family in that way.

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:48.289
He even gave me a nickname, the Bible boy. But I realized that was just a temporary solution.

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:54.289
What I was learning was going to help forever. I was determined to serve Jehovah.

00:03:54.289 --> 00:04:00.289
I returned to Mexico. I started to study the Bible and take it seriously.

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:07.289
I began to view Jehovah as my father because he helped me to find real relief from my pain.

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:15.530
To have peace, a tranquility that makes you feel accepted, loved and wanted.

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:23.209
I have enjoyed an incredible life serving Jehovah.

00:04:23.209 --> 00:04:27.209
Decades later, my father was baptized as one of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:04:27.209 --> 00:04:33.209
Jehovah has been so kind to me. My family and my siblings.

00:04:33.209 --> 00:04:39.810
Truly, I have no way to repay Jehovah for the life he has given me.

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.810
I've had so many blessings in my life.

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:49.810
A wonderful wife, great friends, including those that I serve alongside in Bethel.

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:52.810
I'm not on my own anymore.

00:04:52.810 --> 00:05:00.810
Jehovah has given me a life full of real meaning, purpose and so much happiness.
