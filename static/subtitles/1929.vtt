00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:07.089
At the annual meeting of Jehovah's Witnesses held in October 2013, the governing body was

00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:13.609
pleased to announce the opening of a new display in Brooklyn, New York, entitled The Bible

00:00:13.609 --> 00:00:15.650
and the Divine Name.

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.010
We're happy to provide you with an update on what has happened since that time.

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.690
Our brothers have been excited about the display.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:29.129
More than 133,000 have come to visit since the opening.

00:00:29.129 --> 00:00:36.369
Many have also shown their interest by donating rare and valuable Bibles to enhance this collection.

00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:41.729
We are pleased to share some information about some of these fascinating Bibles.

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:48.109
At the 2013 annual meeting, we expressed interest in obtaining a first edition copy of the

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:52.609
King James Bible, which was printed in the year 1611.

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:56.850
Well, we received a surprising email shortly thereafter.

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.450
A brother wrote and told us that he had located the King James Bible we were looking for.

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:07.170
He explained that while visiting with an elderly couple in his congregation, he mentioned

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.810
that the governing body was interested in locating this particular Bible.

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:16.409
Well, apparently the brother's eyes lit up and he said, I have one, but how could that

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.409
be?

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:22.209
How could he have not just a rare Bible, but the exact one we were looking for?

00:01:22.209 --> 00:01:27.650
We had to wonder if it really was the very rare first edition of the King James Bible.

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.609
How would you know if you had a first edition King James Bible?

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:39.170
In 1604 King James I of England endorsed an updated English language translation to

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.290
be read in the churches.

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:47.090
The first edition can be identified by a number of unique printing variations.

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:53.810
The combination of variations that occur in a given Bible serves as the kind of fingerprint.

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.849
The variation most commonly associated with the first edition of the King James Bible

00:01:58.849 --> 00:02:05.810
is founded Ruth chapter 3 verse 15, which reads, he went into the city.

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.409
Subsequent editions have the rendering she went into the city.

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:14.689
So the first edition is commonly known as the he Bible.

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:20.530
We were excited when we saw that the donated copyright he went into the city.

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.930
When the Bible arrived, it was obvious that the binding of this 400-dural book needed

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.090
restoration, but the pages of the Bible were an excellent condition.

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.729
A brother from Belgium, who was a specialist in book conservation, was able to come and

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:37.650
teach us how to restore this valuable Bible.

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.610
We started the process of restoration by carefully removing each page.

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.930
And we gently cleaned the pages and made any needed repairs.

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:52.129
Next we rebound the Bible using techniques that were used at the time when it was printed.

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:58.789
Lastly, we bound the Bible in a leather cover.

00:02:58.789 --> 00:03:03.430
It has been fully restored so that it may be enjoyed for many years to come.

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:09.270
The King James Bible is one of the most significant books in the English language.

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:15.310
According to the British Library, the King James or authorized version of the Bible remains

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.750
the most widely published text in the English language.

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:25.750
Some estimate the number of printed copies to be over one billion.

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.629
Protestant missionaries often used it as the basis for translating the Bible into other

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:32.310
languages.

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.229
This made its influence even greater.

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:41.509
While through the centuries, as the King James Bible was circulated, the name of Jehovah

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:44.590
became known around the earth.

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:52.349
We have also received two very important Spanish language Bible translations, the Reina Bible

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:55.310
and the Reina Valera Bible.

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.870
Both were produced during the height of the Spanish Inquisition.

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:06.710
By the close of the 15th century, the Spanish Inquisition forbade the translation and possession

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:12.270
of the Scriptures in any vernacular or common language.

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:17.990
Three centuries passed before the ban was finally lifted.

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:25.550
During that difficult time, a few valiant translators produced new Spanish versions abroad and

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.029
had them smuggled into Spain.

00:04:28.029 --> 00:04:35.629
In the mid-1500s, living on a constant fear of arrest, Casiodoro the Reina began translating

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:38.029
the Bible into Spanish.

00:04:38.029 --> 00:04:40.149
This man loved God's name.

00:04:40.149 --> 00:04:46.990
He once said the custom of a meeting God's name perpetrated by the devil arose from a superstition

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:54.509
of modern rabbis who, although claiming to revered, in fact buried his holy name, making

00:04:54.509 --> 00:05:00.430
God's people forget that by which he wished to be distinguished from all other gods.

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:06.709
In 1569, Casiodoro de Reina's translation was finally printed.

00:05:06.709 --> 00:05:12.029
It preserved the divine name Jehovah throughout the Hebrew Scriptures.

00:05:12.029 --> 00:05:20.790
Then in 1582, another brave scholar, Cipriano de Valera, carefully began to revise Reina's

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:22.310
translation.

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:29.509
He was 50 years old when he started and he labored on this translation for the next 20 years.

00:05:29.509 --> 00:05:35.389
In 1602, his work was finally published in Amsterdam.

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:41.829
Valera also valued the divine name and he used it throughout the Hebrew Scriptures.

00:05:41.829 --> 00:05:46.230
Today his translation is known as the Reina Valera Bible.

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:52.269
It has become one of the most widely used translations in the Spanish-speaking world.

00:05:52.269 --> 00:05:57.949
These Bibles remind us of the intense struggle that has taken place to translate the Bible

00:05:57.949 --> 00:06:03.629
into common languages and to preserve the divine name.

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:10.470
Our brothers have manifested tremendous generosity by donating these Bibles and we continue

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:14.230
to be amazed by the Bibles that we are receiving.

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:16.350
Consider another unique example.

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:23.629
In 1964, a man found a 250-year-old Latin Bible in the basement of a church.

00:06:23.629 --> 00:06:25.990
This was a unique find.

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:31.230
The most common edition of the Latin Bible, translated by Jerome, was completed in the year

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:33.230
405.

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:35.870
It came to be known as the Latin Volgate.

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:39.430
Sadly, it does not use the divine name.

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:44.949
However, the Bible that was found in the church basement consistently uses God's name

00:06:44.949 --> 00:06:47.670
throughout the Hebrew Scriptures.

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:54.310
It was the 1708 edition of the Latin translation, produced by Sebastian Schmidt.

00:06:54.310 --> 00:07:01.629
At first when the man discovered this Bible, he was told to burn it, but he just couldn't.

00:07:01.629 --> 00:07:05.829
Recently, this man began studying the Bible with Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:07:05.829 --> 00:07:12.750
When he heard about the Bible display, he donated this very interesting Latin Bible.

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:17.870
Later, when he came to the display and saw the Bible there, he said,

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:24.069
After 50 years of this Bible sitting in my house, it is thrilling to see thousands of

00:07:24.069 --> 00:07:27.709
people finally able to enjoy it.

00:07:27.709 --> 00:07:34.629
In the early 16th century, many people had a strong desire to know more about the Bible.

00:07:34.629 --> 00:07:42.389
By that time, the Latin Volgate had been the common Bible for more than 1,000 years,

00:07:42.389 --> 00:07:47.430
but sadly, most people could not read Latin.

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:53.269
Adding to the problem, many errors had crept into the Volgate as it was copied over the

00:07:53.269 --> 00:07:55.670
centuries.

00:07:55.670 --> 00:08:01.230
Translators and scholars realized that they needed to go back to the original languages

00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:08.069
if they were to produce accurate Bible translations that would satisfy the growing thirst for

00:08:08.069 --> 00:08:09.870
scriptural knowledge.

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:17.069
In 1,502, Cardinal Jimenez, the Cisneros, began work on what would become a historic Bible

00:08:17.069 --> 00:08:19.589
translation tool.

00:08:19.589 --> 00:08:23.470
Today it is known as the Complutensian Polyglot.

00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:31.069
Cisneros began gathering as many ancient manuscripts as he could find in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin.

00:08:31.069 --> 00:08:36.230
Then a team of scholars started to compare the manuscripts with the idea of producing

00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:41.350
one complete master text for each of the three languages.

00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:46.669
It took the scholars ten years to compile this monumental work, and then the actual printing

00:08:46.669 --> 00:08:49.710
took another four years.

00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:54.789
Spanish printers did not have the necessary type files and had to prepare them before the

00:08:54.789 --> 00:08:56.830
Bible could be printed.

00:08:56.830 --> 00:09:05.149
Finally, between 1,514 and 1,517, the 6th volume set was printed.

00:09:05.149 --> 00:09:10.470
After some 15 years of effort, this was an overwhelming accomplishment.

00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:16.350
It was the first time that Hebrew, Greek, and Latin master text for the entire Bible were

00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:20.789
printed side by side, making them easy to compare.

00:09:20.789 --> 00:09:25.629
Actually, this was the first time that the complete New Testament had ever been printed

00:09:25.629 --> 00:09:26.830
in Greek.

00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:32.950
However, the Pope did not give approval to the Polyglot until years later, delaying its

00:09:33.029 --> 00:09:37.070
public release until 1,522.

00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:42.870
The Complotension Polyglot was an important step in the refinement and preservation of the

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:46.190
Greek and Hebrew text of God's Word.

00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:52.309
Of the approximately 600 copies originally printed, only about 1-5th are known to have

00:09:52.309 --> 00:09:55.230
survived until today.

00:09:55.230 --> 00:10:00.789
At about the same time that the Complotension Polyglot was produced, another scholar,

00:10:00.789 --> 00:10:05.830
Tiziderios Erasmus, was working on his Greek New Testament.

00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:11.110
He too wanted to make available the complete printed Greek New Testament for the use of

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:14.470
scholars and Bible translators.

00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:18.950
He was able to publish his work in 1,516.

00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:24.710
Because the distribution of the Complotension Polyglot was delayed, Erasmus Greek New Testament

00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:29.750
became the first complete printed edition available to scholars.

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:35.070
Not breaking translators such as Martin Luther and William Tyndale used various editions

00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:42.230
of his text to accomplish their work of translating the Greek scriptures into German and English.

00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:49.070
We are pleased to inform you that the Complotension Polyglot and Erasmus Greek New Testament of

00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:54.629
1516 have both been donated to the Bible display.

00:10:54.629 --> 00:10:59.509
Of course, those who have visited the display may have difficulty imagining that we would

00:10:59.509 --> 00:11:04.029
have enough space to include these fascinating Bibles there.

00:11:04.029 --> 00:11:09.509
We are pleased to announce that the designated area for the Bible display at Warwick will

00:11:09.509 --> 00:11:11.590
be much larger.

00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:14.070
Would you like to see what it will look like?

00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:18.950
The governing body has directed that the display should feature the Bible.

00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:23.269
The Bible itself should be the star of the display.

00:11:23.269 --> 00:11:28.070
And in particular, the focus should be on Jehovah's name.

00:11:28.070 --> 00:11:34.549
Therefore, the overall design of the display will communicate a feeling of deep respect

00:11:34.549 --> 00:11:37.509
and reverence for God's Word.

00:11:37.509 --> 00:11:43.549
We will use strong architectural features to illustrate the strength and security that

00:11:43.549 --> 00:11:46.990
come from reading and applying God's Word.

00:11:46.990 --> 00:11:53.389
The lighting and interior design will help to create a spiritually reflective environment.

00:11:53.389 --> 00:11:57.070
The main part of the display will be permanent in nature.

00:11:57.070 --> 00:12:01.190
We will continue to tell of the story of the Bible and the divine name as in the current

00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:03.070
exhibit in Brooklyn.

00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:08.870
There will also be an area for additional exhibits where we will display many other rare

00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:11.149
and unique Bibles.

00:12:11.149 --> 00:12:14.509
This area will be updated periodically.

00:12:14.509 --> 00:12:19.509
Of course, the Bibles that we have discussed are only a few of the many that have been

00:12:19.509 --> 00:12:21.470
generously donated.

00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:28.549
We have also received items such as the Leipzig Polyglot and the Julia E. Smith Bible.

00:12:28.549 --> 00:12:34.350
Julia E. Smith was the first woman to make a complete English translation of the Bible

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:37.070
from the original Hebrew and Greek.

00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:44.309
She produced a literal translation and in her work, she chose to preserve the divine name.

00:12:44.309 --> 00:12:49.629
We can't mention all of the donations in this brief update, but if you visit the Bible

00:12:49.629 --> 00:12:56.590
display when it opens in Warwick, New York, you will be able to see many of them there.

00:12:56.590 --> 00:13:02.950
By that time, we hope to have received even more rare and unique Bibles to add to the

00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:04.990
display.

00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:13.830
These Bibles remind us of the many God-fearing people down through the ages who work tirelessly

00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:19.470
to preserve God's Word and to make known His holy name.

00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:26.950
They also show that Jehovah has fulfilled His promise to preserve His Word and to magnify

00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:30.309
His name in all the earth.

00:13:30.309 --> 00:13:36.429
We invite all of you to come and see the Bible display at our current World Headquarters

00:13:36.429 --> 00:13:42.549
in Brooklyn and later when it is greatly expanded in Warwick.

00:13:42.549 --> 00:13:49.350
We are certain that it will deepen your appreciation for God's precious Word and for His

00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:51.950
matchless name, Jehovah.
