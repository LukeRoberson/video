00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:06.820
Konstantin Bajanov is one of the first to host witnesses in Russia to serve out a prison

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:12.380
sentence since the Supreme Court banned their organization's activity in 2017.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.859
He was released from a prison colony on May 5, 2021.

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.699
Upon release, he was immediately transferred to a deportation holding center and then deported

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:23.019
to Ukraine.

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:27.980
He was deported because Russia had annouled his citizenship as a consequence of his criminal

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.579
prosecution.

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:34.380
Several charges were first initiated against Konstantin after Russian officers rated

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.979
seven homes of Czechoslovak's witnesses, including his on June 12, 2018.

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:42.740
After that, he was charged with extremism.

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:47.740
Eventually, Konstantin and five of his fellow worshippers were sent to a pretrial detention

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:48.740
center.

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:54.299
The FSB, the investigator and other operatives promised me that if I pleaded guilty and

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:59.299
began cooperating with them, they would guarantee me a suspended sentence and I would

00:00:59.299 --> 00:01:01.539
not go to prison.

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:06.060
Konstantin refused to cooperate with the authorities, which would have meant compromising his

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.060
faith.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.939
In total, Konstantin spent almost a year in pretrial detention followed by several months

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.579
of restrictions of certain activities while awaiting the court sentence.

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:22.180
He was accused of organizing the activity of an extremist organization.

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.379
The main accusation was based on the fact that he held a religious meeting in the winter

00:01:27.379 --> 00:01:29.859
in January 2018.

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:36.219
People there read the Bible, sang spiritual songs, discussed how to live by Bible principles.

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:41.780
The investigator interpreted this religious meeting as a meeting of a legal entity that

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.019
was banned in Russia.

00:01:44.019 --> 00:01:50.700
On September 19, 2019, the judge announced the verdict, three and a half years in a general

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.299
regime prison colony.

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:56.980
Every month later, the Court of Appeal upheld the sentence.

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:03.620
And on February 4, 2020, Konstantin was sent to the prison colony.

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:09.180
On February 8, 2020, I was taken to the colony, two correctional colonies, three in the

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:12.020
city of Dmitrovgrad, Ulyanovsk region.

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.099
I worked in the colony store.

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:19.180
I received a lot of letters and prison, an officer summoned me and said to me,

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:25.139
«Bajanov, we received 300 letters for the whole colony in a year, but you alone have

00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:28.060
received over 300 letters in a month.

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.460
Who do you think you are?

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.340
Do you want our inspector to drown in these letters?

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:39.060
Well, I explained that people want to support me, encourage me, and comfort me in some way».

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.939
Konstantin spent a year and three months in a prison colony and was granted early conditional

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:46.900
release on May 5, 2021.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.580
It was a happy moment.

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.099
I saw Irina, my wife, and we hugged.

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:55.979
The head of the prison division said, «Kostya, I didn't expect so many people.

00:02:55.979 --> 00:03:00.620
I knew you had brothers and sisters, and the letters have been written to you, but it

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.419
still amazes me that so many people would come to meet you».

00:03:04.419 --> 00:03:07.539
He concluded, «You must be a happy person».

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:11.979
When the day arrived for him to be deported, Konstantin received further support from his

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:13.500
fellow believers.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.500
In the 19th of May, we arrived at the border.

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.419
They checked my documents and issued everything.

00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:24.060
My brothers and sisters were there to meet me with the poster and flowers, and my dear

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.460
wife Irina was there.

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:31.740
It was such an unforgettable moment, how we saw and hugged each other.

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:37.340
Justice Jehovah promised to provide the way out of trials, so he did for me.

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:42.860
Indeed, he pushed all the barriers aside and made it happen so that my wife and I were

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.300
able to reunite on our wedding anniversary.

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.219
It brought us in measurable joy.
