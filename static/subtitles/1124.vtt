00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:07.370
Do you want to be rich?

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:18.910
Most persons would immediately answer, of course I do, because they think of being rich means that they will enjoy life and have happiness and contentment.

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:21.910
But let's ask her second question.

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:26.410
What are you willing to do to become rich?

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.410
Now that's a lot harder to answer, isn't it?

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:37.409
As you think about the importance of that question, let's read a very important warning that the Bible gives us.

00:00:37.409 --> 00:00:43.409
If you'd like to take your Bibles, please, and we'll turn together to the first book of Timothy.

00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:49.409
First Timothy, chapter 6, and verses 9 and 10.

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:52.409
And this is the warning.

00:00:52.909 --> 00:01:05.409
But those who are determined to be rich fall into temptation and a snare and many senseless and harmful desires that plunge men into destruction and ruin.

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:20.409
For the love of money is a root of all sorts of injurious things, and by reaching out for this love some have been led astray from the faith and have stabbed themselves all over with many pains.

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:24.409
Well that certainly is a very important warning, isn't it?

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:30.409
When we look at it, we see that below the Bible acknowledges that money is useful.

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:37.909
It highlights here the love of money, or in other words those who are determined to be rich.

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:40.909
And notice at the end, there are verse 10.

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:46.909
It says this can lead to persons being stabbed all over with many pains.

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:53.909
In other words, they have gain, but they also have pain along with it.

00:01:53.909 --> 00:02:00.409
But there's something else that can cause problems for those who have a love for money.

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:07.409
They may sacrifice their health, they may sacrifice their family life, and even their standards.

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.909
But the Bible highlights yet something else that they need to be careful about.

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:22.909
And at this time if we turn our Bibles to the book of Proverbs, please turn with me to Proverbs chapter 28 and verse 20.

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:27.409
That's Proverbs 28 verse 20.

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:37.409
A faithful man will receive many blessings, but the one hastening to get rich, or in other words in a hurry he wants quickly to get rich.

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:42.909
What does it say? Well, that person will not remain innocent.

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:49.409
And isn't that true? That many people steal, lie, cheat.

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:57.409
They even prostitute themselves, and others kill other persons just to get rich.

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:03.409
So truly, these are important questions for each one of us to think about.

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:11.409
But why does the Bible highlight so strongly this warning about trying to get rich?

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:18.409
Well, one of the reasons is that the Bible highlights the deceptive power of riches.

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:24.409
Now you might be wondering, what does that mean, the deceptive power of riches?

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:27.409
Well, maybe we could illustrate it this way.

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:38.409
Imagine you wake up in the middle of a dark night. The wind is blowing strongly, the rain is falling heavily, and you start to worry about flooding.

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:45.409
Then you see that there's no electricity, so you start to grow up around and you find the flashlight.

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:54.409
So all of a sudden you feel like you have some help because you can see what's happening. But as you try to turn it on, there's no light.

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:59.409
So then you remember, ah, I just bought some batteries.

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:04.409
And as you grow up around in the drawer, you find, here I've got a battery.

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:09.409
So you put them in with the hope that this will now give you light.

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:15.409
But the batteries are dead. Perhaps there's a problem with them.

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:23.410
That is the deceptive power. You put your reliance on something and it doesn't help you.

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:29.410
Well, in a similar way, money can have that same type of deceptive power.

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:37.410
We may look at it, we may think, yes, this will help me. But what happens in times of trouble?

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:44.410
So the Bible helps us to see that money doesn't always give us the hope that we need in times of problems.

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:48.410
Let's just think about three different areas of life.

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:55.410
First of all, money doesn't automatically mean that we have genuine security.

00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:01.410
I'm sure you'll agree, the more money we have, perhaps the more security that we need to have to protect it.

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:06.410
But if we think about this, the Bible clearly highlights the problem.

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:14.410
And this time if you'd like to turn with me to the book of Proverbs, but we're going to read Proverbs chapter 18.

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:20.410
So please turn there to Proverbs 18 and verse 11.

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:25.410
And notice this very interesting word picture that the Bible uses here.

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:35.410
The wealth of the rich is his fortified city. It is like a protective wall in his imagination.

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:39.410
Now that is very thought provoking, isn't it?

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:51.410
Perhaps we could illustrate it this way. A person may pay a lot of money every month for a security firm to care for his home and his family.

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:54.410
And each night he may sleep very soundly.

00:05:54.410 --> 00:06:03.410
But what if he found out later that this was a fake company? There were no security guards. He was just paying money for nothing.

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:09.410
That security would be only security in his imagination, wouldn't it?

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:15.410
The Bible also highlights another aspect of this and I'm sure you'll agree with these comments.

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:24.410
In chapter 23 of the same book, the book of Proverbs, Proverbs 23 and verses 4 and 5.

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:32.410
It starts with this very good warning. Do not wear yourself out to gain wealth.

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:39.410
Stop and show understanding. Now notice the word picture.

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:45.410
When you cast your eyes on it that is on wealth or money, it's not there.

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:51.410
For it will surely sprout wings like an eagle and fly off into the sky.

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:58.410
Now I'm sure you've experienced that haven't you. Your paycheck comes. You think, yes, I've got some money.

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:03.410
You turn your back and all of a sudden it's gone. There's not enough money.

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:09.410
And in a bigger sense, in recent times we've seen how money can be devalued.

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:16.410
How even precious commodities such as oil and gold can lose their value.

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:24.410
It reminds me a number of years ago someone gave me this bank note and looking at it and reading it it says,

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:31.410
I promise to pay the bearer on demand $20 billion.

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:37.410
Well, in outward appearances it looks like I'm quite wealthy.

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:44.410
But you probably guessed that if I were to present this and demand payment, I really wouldn't get much from it.

00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:48.410
Because this money has been devalued.

00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:59.410
So in a similar way, just like the batteries that don't work, money at times does not give us the security that we want.

00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:09.410
Now a second area in which money can't automatically give us what we want is with regard to happiness and contentment.

00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:14.410
Yes, money doesn't automatically bring happiness and contentment.

00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:21.410
You've probably seen accounts of persons who appear to be very successful, they're famous, they have money.

00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:29.410
And yet when they're interviewed they talk about how lonely they feel and how meaningless their lives are.

00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:32.409
And that's exactly what the Bible tells us.

00:08:32.409 --> 00:08:41.409
It mentions that someone who accumulates a lot of money isn't ever really satisfied with what they've already got.

00:08:41.409 --> 00:08:51.409
They want more. Isn't that true? We've heard accounts of persons one way or another who have accumulated billions of dollars.

00:08:51.409 --> 00:09:00.409
But they just keep on accumulating money even though they couldn't use all that money in 10 or 20 lifetimes.

00:09:00.409 --> 00:09:09.409
The Bible also tells us that oftentimes a rich person stays awake at night worrying about his money.

00:09:09.409 --> 00:09:16.409
But you know there's another area that is even more important than those first two areas of life.

00:09:16.409 --> 00:09:23.409
And that is money cannot automatically bring God's blessings.

00:09:23.409 --> 00:09:27.409
Now that's an interesting thought. Why can we say that?

00:09:27.409 --> 00:09:31.409
Well let's look to the words of our Lord Jesus Christ.

00:09:31.409 --> 00:09:38.409
These are recorded for us in the book of Matthew, so please turn with me to Matthew chapter 6.

00:09:38.409 --> 00:09:42.409
And we're going to read verse 24.

00:09:42.409 --> 00:09:47.409
These words of Jesus were part of the Sermon on the Mount.

00:09:47.409 --> 00:09:54.409
Notice what Jesus says. Matthew 6 verse 24.

00:09:54.409 --> 00:10:01.409
No one can slave for two masters. For either he will hate the one and love the other.

00:10:01.409 --> 00:10:05.409
Or he will stick to the one and despise the other.

00:10:05.409 --> 00:10:11.409
You cannot slave for God and for riches.

00:10:11.409 --> 00:10:14.409
Well that says it very clearly doesn't it?

00:10:14.409 --> 00:10:22.409
You see, we have to make a choice. We can't serve God and riches at the same time.

00:10:22.409 --> 00:10:27.409
So this would affect our service and our love of God.

00:10:27.409 --> 00:10:34.409
So looking at those three areas of life, we see that money can be like that dead battery.

00:10:34.409 --> 00:10:41.409
It doesn't necessarily give us genuine security. It doesn't necessarily give us happiness and contentment.

00:10:41.409 --> 00:10:46.409
And it can interfere with our relationship with God.

00:10:46.409 --> 00:11:04.049
Now let's look at a video and we're going to see in this video how two individuals are affected by this love for material things or for money.

00:11:04.049 --> 00:11:15.649
I thought happiness was all about money and getting to buy whatever I wanted.

00:11:15.649 --> 00:11:24.649
I was really into fashion. I was always thinking about what I was going to get next and I didn't mind putting an extra overtime to get it.

00:11:24.649 --> 00:11:37.070
My day ended with me taking the last train home, eating and then bed at one or two o'clock in the morning.

00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:42.070
But this affected me mentally and physically.

00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:46.070
I'd wake up in the middle of the night with panic attacks.

00:11:46.070 --> 00:11:58.389
I felt so lost and confused. Everything I'd worked for was for nothing.

00:11:59.389 --> 00:12:11.720
My motor for shopping was when in doubt by about a lot of things, powerful motorcycles, a house, cars.

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:16.720
I was totally absorbed in work and sometimes worked all night.

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:24.759
I somehow made it to meetings but after they ended, I'd leave right away.

00:12:24.759 --> 00:12:28.759
I didn't show interest in anyone, not even my wife.

00:12:28.759 --> 00:12:35.759
All I ever talked about was work and I showed a real lack of consideration for my wife.

00:12:35.759 --> 00:12:41.759
I was really blunt with her and there was a constant back and forth between us.

00:12:41.759 --> 00:12:46.759
And we had a strained relationship. We weren't happy.

00:12:46.759 --> 00:12:52.759
We just felt stress, stress and more stress. Everything seemed pointless.

00:12:52.759 --> 00:13:03.159
What did we see in that video?

00:13:03.159 --> 00:13:09.159
You noticed that both those individuals really enjoyed going after money.

00:13:09.159 --> 00:13:15.159
They wanted to be rich. But did they receive happiness and contentment?

00:13:15.159 --> 00:13:23.159
No. There were problems that came along with it. They gained some things but with pain.

00:13:23.159 --> 00:13:28.159
So considering all these factors we've just discussed,

00:13:28.159 --> 00:13:32.159
does it mean that it's wrong for us to want to be rich?

00:13:32.159 --> 00:13:37.159
Not at all. Now that may sound like a contradiction.

00:13:37.159 --> 00:13:40.159
But let's have a look at another scripture in the book of Proverbs.

00:13:40.159 --> 00:13:44.159
At this time we'll turn to Proverbs chapter 10.

00:13:44.159 --> 00:13:52.159
In chapter 10 verse 22, notice it talks about a different sort of riches.

00:13:52.159 --> 00:13:58.159
What is it? Well, let's read it in Proverbs 10-22.

00:13:58.159 --> 00:14:06.159
It is the blessing of Jehovah that makes one rich and he adds no pain with it.

00:14:06.159 --> 00:14:12.159
Did you notice what is it that really brings us true riches?

00:14:12.159 --> 00:14:15.159
It's the blessing of Jehovah.

00:14:15.159 --> 00:14:24.159
Yes, the blessings that we gain from God are true riches because notice what it says at the end of that verse.

00:14:24.159 --> 00:14:31.159
He adds no pain with it. So it's gain without pain.

00:14:31.159 --> 00:14:34.159
But when we think about this, we might ask,

00:14:34.159 --> 00:14:39.159
how could we ever accumulate these types of riches?

00:14:39.159 --> 00:14:43.159
Well, our Lord Jesus Christ answered this in the Sermon on the Mount.

00:14:43.159 --> 00:14:49.159
And if you turn back with me to that chapter we already referred to, Matthew chapter 6.

00:14:49.159 --> 00:14:57.159
You'll notice here that Jesus describes to us how we can obtain these genuine riches.

00:14:57.159 --> 00:15:02.399
Matthew 6, 19 through 21,

00:15:02.399 --> 00:15:05.399
stops storing up for yourselves treasures on the earth,

00:15:05.399 --> 00:15:10.399
where mouth and rust consume, and where thieves break in and steal.

00:15:10.399 --> 00:15:15.399
Rather, store up for yourselves treasures in heaven,

00:15:15.399 --> 00:15:21.399
where neither mouth nor rust consumes, and where thieves do not break in and steal.

00:15:21.399 --> 00:15:27.399
For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.

00:15:27.399 --> 00:15:30.399
Do we see what Jesus is telling us here?

00:15:30.399 --> 00:15:35.399
Not to just strive after getting material riches here on the earth,

00:15:35.399 --> 00:15:40.399
but notice He says that we should store up treasures in heaven.

00:15:40.399 --> 00:15:43.399
Now this is not talking about an offshore bank account.

00:15:43.399 --> 00:15:49.399
Rather, it's talking in a symbolic way about how we can build up,

00:15:49.399 --> 00:15:55.399
as it were, a good relationship with God by means of the things that we do.

00:15:55.399 --> 00:16:00.399
Yes, these are true treasures.

00:16:00.399 --> 00:16:03.399
But now when we think about the life of Jesus Christ,

00:16:03.399 --> 00:16:06.399
He lived by these things that He preached.

00:16:06.399 --> 00:16:11.399
He didn't try to accumulate all these material things in His life.

00:16:11.399 --> 00:16:17.399
No, He focused on serving His Heavenly Father, Jehovah.

00:16:17.399 --> 00:16:24.399
He wasn't distracted by greed or by some desire for personal fame and glory.

00:16:24.399 --> 00:16:29.399
No, He focused on building up these treasures in heaven.

00:16:29.399 --> 00:16:32.399
You might remember, even at one time in His life,

00:16:32.399 --> 00:16:35.399
Satan the devil tried to tempt Him.

00:16:35.399 --> 00:16:39.399
Do you remember one of those temptations involved this very fact

00:16:39.399 --> 00:16:44.399
that Jesus resisted the desire to accumulate material things?

00:16:44.399 --> 00:16:48.399
Let's turn our Bibles this time to the Book of Matthew.

00:16:48.399 --> 00:16:52.399
And we'll look at one of the temptations as recorded here by Matthew.

00:16:52.399 --> 00:16:59.399
It's Matthew chapter 4 and verses 8 through 10.

00:16:59.399 --> 00:17:05.400
And here we're told, again, the devil took Him along to an unusually high mountain

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:10.400
and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:12.400
And He said to them,

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:19.400
all these things I will give you if you fall down and do an act of worship to Me.

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:21.400
Then Jesus said to Him,

00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:24.400
go away, Satan, for it is written,

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:27.400
it is Jehovah your God you must worship,

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:32.400
and it is to Him alone you must render sacred service.

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:42.400
So Jesus clearly rejected this temptation to accept from Satan all these riches and glories of the world.

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:46.400
His focus was on serving Jehovah.

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:49.400
And that was the wise thing to do.

00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:51.400
If you stop and think about it,

00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:57.400
you see if riches and the glory of the world are the very things that make us happy,

00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:01.400
then why was Satan willing to give all that away?

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:04.400
Obviously it hadn't given him the happiness.

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:06.400
He wanted something else, didn't he?

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:13.400
Jesus selected the right thing to build up treasures in heaven.

00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:16.400
So if we worship Jehovah and obey Him,

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:24.400
we can expect to get our lives enriched by these wonderful things that Jehovah gives us.

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:29.400
What are some of the symbolic riches we could say that we can again even now?

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:32.400
Well let's think about five different things.

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:36.400
The first one is in a well-known scripture in the book of Psalms.

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:41.400
So please turn with me to Psalm 83.

00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:46.400
Psalm 83, and we're going to read verse 18.

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:51.400
May people know that you, whose name is Jehovah,

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:57.400
you alone are the most high over all the earth.

00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:03.400
So what's the first of these things that can enrich our lives?

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:05.400
It's knowing God.

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:09.400
You see many people like to know the rich and famous,

00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:15.400
but just think of it, we have the privilege of coming to know the sovereign of the universe.

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:19.400
Yes, by learning about Him and getting to know Him,

00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:22.400
our lives truly become rich.

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:27.400
Now in addition to that, we become worshippers of Jehovah,

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:31.400
and that includes us in a worldwide brotherhood,

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:37.400
a brotherhood that comes from all sorts of nations and racial backgrounds and languages,

00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:43.400
and yet even this global brotherhood is united in love,

00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:46.400
the love of serving Jehovah God.

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:50.400
So that's something that enriches our lives as well.

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:55.400
A third point is that even though we're living in difficult times,

00:19:55.400 --> 00:20:01.400
when we follow the advice and direction given to us by Jehovah through His Word, the Bible,

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:04.400
then we can attain a measure of happiness right now.

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:11.400
For example, the Bible gives us advice on how to be good fathers and mothers and children,

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:17.400
and that can add to happiness, love, and unity in the family.

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:21.400
But something else that's important that enriches our lives.

00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:23.400
We have hope.

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:25.400
Yes, hope for the future.

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:30.400
Even though we're living in a world that's dominated by wicked people,

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:34.400
the Bible tells us about what's going to happen in the future.

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:37.400
Please turn with me back to the book of Psalms.

00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:43.400
This time we're going to read Psalm 37 and verse 22.

00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:46.400
Notice the promise that's given here.

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:54.259
Those blessed by Him, that is Jehovah, will possess the earth,

00:20:54.259 --> 00:20:59.259
but those cursed by Him will be done away with.

00:20:59.259 --> 00:21:05.259
So the Bible promises us that in the future there'll be a big change here on earth,

00:21:05.259 --> 00:21:10.259
and only those who love God will possess the earth.

00:21:10.259 --> 00:21:12.259
What a beautiful hope.

00:21:13.259 --> 00:21:18.259
Now the fifth point is the wonderful promise that the Bible gives us,

00:21:18.259 --> 00:21:24.259
that those who we love have already died will have the opportunity of being resurrected,

00:21:24.259 --> 00:21:27.259
or in other words, being brought back to life.

00:21:27.259 --> 00:21:29.259
Notice the promise of Jesus.

00:21:29.259 --> 00:21:33.259
It's recorded in John chapter 5.

00:21:33.259 --> 00:21:40.259
So please turn with me to John chapter 5 and verses 28 and 29.

00:21:40.259 --> 00:21:44.799
This is Jesus' promise.

00:21:44.799 --> 00:21:53.799
Do not be amazed at this, for the hour is coming in which all those in the memorial tombs will hear His voice and come out.

00:21:53.799 --> 00:21:57.799
Those who did good things to a resurrection of life,

00:21:57.799 --> 00:22:03.799
and those who practice while things to a resurrection of judgment.

00:22:03.799 --> 00:22:07.799
What beautiful hopes these are.

00:22:07.799 --> 00:22:15.799
I hope for a change in the world, and I hope for those who have died to come back and live again in a paradise.

00:22:15.799 --> 00:22:20.799
Those are the things that can enrich our lives right now.

00:22:20.799 --> 00:22:24.799
So let's think back to those two individuals in the video.

00:22:24.799 --> 00:22:27.799
How could they change their lives?

00:22:27.799 --> 00:22:34.799
So instead of trying to pursue after material riches, they could achieve these true riches.

00:22:34.799 --> 00:22:36.799
Let's watch and see.

00:22:43.299 --> 00:22:53.299
I realized that I hadn't been caring for myself on the inside, so I decided to read the Bible all over again.

00:22:53.299 --> 00:23:02.299
I was especially moved by how Jehovah repeatedly tried to help the Israelites, despite all their failures.

00:23:02.299 --> 00:23:11.480
This reminded me that Jehovah had been expressing his love for me all along.

00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:14.480
I couldn't hold back my tears.

00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:23.160
I decided that I'd live the rest of my life for him.

00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:28.160
I adjusted my work and made the ministry the focal point in my life.

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:43.240
When I get to share a Bible scripture with someone and see it make an impact on them, I feel truly happy.

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:50.240
I saw some brothers from the congregation playing soccer with a young boy who had just lost his father.

00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:57.279
They were trying to comfort him by spending time with him.

00:23:57.279 --> 00:24:04.279
When I saw them showing personal interest in someone and considering others' feelings, it really impressed me.

00:24:04.279 --> 00:24:08.279
And I thought, I want to use my time like that as well.

00:24:08.279 --> 00:24:14.279
A scripture in the Bible says, there is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving.

00:24:14.279 --> 00:24:17.279
The more I practiced it, the happier I became.

00:24:17.279 --> 00:24:21.279
I became convinced that this really is the truth.

00:24:21.279 --> 00:24:27.279
Now, when my wife and I spend time together, I am better able to really understand her.

00:24:27.279 --> 00:24:31.279
And I've come to realize how much she means to me.

00:24:31.279 --> 00:24:41.779
I am so thankful that Jehovah has taught me the truth.

00:24:41.779 --> 00:24:46.779
So how did these two individuals gain true riches?

00:24:46.779 --> 00:24:49.779
By focusing on serving Jehovah God.

00:24:49.779 --> 00:24:56.779
By telling others the good news about what's in the Bible and by sharing good things with others.

00:24:56.779 --> 00:25:07.779
Yes, if we've started in a life course that involves just looking for material riches, we too can change and follow their example.

00:25:07.779 --> 00:25:10.779
But what about the future?

00:25:10.779 --> 00:25:17.779
What true riches are ahead of us in the future if we continue to have a good relationship with Jehovah God?

00:25:17.779 --> 00:25:24.779
I'd like to turn your attention to a beautiful prophecy in the book of Revelation.

00:25:24.779 --> 00:25:28.779
Please take your Bibles and turn to this book Revelation.

00:25:28.779 --> 00:25:34.779
We're going to look at chapter 21 and verses 3 through 5.

00:25:34.779 --> 00:25:46.779
As we read these words, imagine if you would please what a beautiful place the world will be when Jehovah God makes it into a paradise.

00:25:46.779 --> 00:25:52.160
That's Revelation 21, 3 through 5.

00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:55.160
With that I heard a loud voice from the Throne say,

00:25:55.160 --> 00:26:02.160
Look, the 10th of God is with mankind, and He will reside with them, and they will be His people,

00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:11.160
and God Himself will be with them, and He will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more,

00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:15.160
neither will morning or a cry, nor pain be any more.

00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:18.160
The former things have passed away.

00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:24.160
And the one seated on the Throne said, Look, I'm making all things you.

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:30.160
Also, He says, Right for these words are faithful and true.

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:33.160
What a beautiful promise this is.

00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:41.160
In other words, in the future this earth will be turned into a paradise, and notice it says no more tears,

00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:47.160
no more morning or a cry, and also notice it says no more pain.

00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:52.160
These are the blessings that come from Jehovah God.

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:56.160
But how will people feel at that particular time?

00:26:56.160 --> 00:27:01.160
Let's turn our Bibles to our final scripture in the book of Isaiah.

00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:04.160
Isaiah chapter 65.

00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:08.160
And we're going to start reading at verse 17.

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:17.160
In the beginning of verse 17, it mentions about the new heavens and new earth, the Jehovah is planning to bring about.

00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:21.160
But notice the last part of verse 17.

00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:29.160
And the former things will not be called to mind, nor will they come up into the heart.

00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:31.160
What a wonderful blessing that is.

00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:33.160
That's something that money can't buy.

00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:45.160
In other words, no matter what traumatic experiences we've had in this life, no matter what pain we've experienced, those things will be healed.

00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:47.160
No more pain at all.

00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:52.160
What a beautiful promise from our loving Heavenly Father, Jehovah.

00:27:52.160 --> 00:28:00.160
And notice if we look down to verses 21 through 23, some of the activities that people will be engaged in.

00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:06.160
They will build houses and live in them, and they will plant vineyards and eat their fruitage.

00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:09.160
They will not build for someone else to inhabit.

00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:12.160
Nor will they plant for others to eat.

00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:16.160
For the days of my people will be like the days of a tree.

00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:22.160
And the work of their hands, my chosen ones will enjoy to the full.

00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:24.160
They will not toil for nothing.

00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:27.160
Nor will they bear children for distress.

00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:35.160
Because they are the offspring made up of those blessed by Jehovah and their descendants with them.

00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:39.160
What a wonderful time that will be.

00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:43.160
And that can be part of the riches that you can attain.

00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:48.160
Yes, what should be the determination of each one of us?

00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:55.160
We don't want to strive after fake riches, riches that just give us gain with pain.

00:28:55.160 --> 00:29:00.160
Rather, let us strengthen our relationship with our Heavenly Father, Jehovah.

00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:08.160
And in this way, we truly will reach out for the real riches, those that we gain without pain.
