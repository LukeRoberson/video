00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.620
Welcome to JW Broadcasting.

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.619
In this month's program, we'll see how much the Bible can improve our lives,

00:00:09.619 --> 00:00:13.619
how it can save us from lasting harm,

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:16.620
how it can help us to get along with one another,

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:21.620
and how it reassures us that even if we stumble,

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:24.620
Jehovah will help us find our way back.

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:27.620
From the life of John the Baptist,

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.620
we'll learn how to cope with fear,

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:32.619
rejoice when others are blessed,

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:38.619
and maintain a positive attitude even when facing problems.

00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:41.619
We'll see from Brother Gordon McKay's experience

00:00:41.619 --> 00:00:45.619
that Jehovah wants us to draw close to him,

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:49.619
even if we've had a serious spiritual setback.

00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:54.619
And our newest music video extends a warm invitation to all

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:57.619
who find themselves estranged from Jehovah

00:00:57.619 --> 00:01:00.619
and his imperfect but faithful family.

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:07.620
It reminds us of what a wonderful blessing our spiritual home is.

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:13.620
This is the February 2024 edition of JW Broadcasting.

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:35.609
When I was young, one of my favorite desserts

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:38.609
was my mother's sweet potato pie.

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:40.609
It always tasted the same.

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:45.609
To me, it was perfect every time.

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:47.609
I'd often ask her,

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:52.609
what do you put in here to make it taste so good?

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:54.609
She'd always respond,

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:58.609
I just use the same stuff every time.

00:01:58.609 --> 00:02:01.609
In other words, number one, she wasn't going to tell me,

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:05.609
and two, she had a recipe that worked,

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:08.610
so she never changed it.

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.610
Well, the Bible is like a cookbook,

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.610
full of recipes that work,

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.610
that can make our life spiritually successful.

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.610
Please note how Paul explains the benefits of these recipes

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.610
at 2 Timothy, chapter 3, verses 16 and 17.

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.610
All scripture is inspired of God

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.610
and beneficial for teaching,

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.610
for reproving, for setting things straight,

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.610
for disciplining and righteousness,

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.610
so that the man of God may be fully competent,

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:48.610
completely equipped for every good work.

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.610
Sometimes the recipe from God's inspired word

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.610
comes in a form of a Bible example.

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.610
As we study that example,

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.610
we extract qualities and attitudes that we can imitate.

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:08.610
Other times, there's a list of qualities,

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.610
such as the various aspects of the fruitage of God's spirit,

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.610
mentioned in Galatians chapter 5,

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.610
or the list of positive things to consider

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:19.610
at Philippians 4, 8, and 9.

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.610
And of course, there are numerous Bible principles

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:28.610
that we can use to help us make good decisions.

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.610
Meditating on and applying these principles,

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.610
qualities, and examples can be a recipe

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:40.610
that contributes to spiritual success.

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:42.610
Let's consider one example.

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:47.610
It's recorded in 1 Peter 3 and verse 8.

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:51.610
Take note of the ingredients.

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.610
All of you have unity of mind,

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.610
fellow feeling, brotherly affection,

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.610
tender compassion, and humility.

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:07.610
This is a recipe of five beautiful qualities

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.610
that contribute to our spiritual success.

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:12.610
How so?

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:14.610
Let's discuss the ingredients.

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:19.610
Peter first mentions unity of mind.

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:21.610
The footnote says,

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:24.610
think in agreement.

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.610
So we must think in agreement with one another,

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.610
but especially with Jehovah and his organization.

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.610
In what way?

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.610
The latter part of Isaiah 35 says,

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:43.610
your strength will be in keeping calm and showing trust.

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.610
That's exactly what the faithful slave has done.

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:51.610
So let us have unity of mind with them

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:56.610
and have the same calmness and confidence in Jehovah

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:59.610
as we face personal challenges in our life.

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:03.860
In 2 Kings chapter 4,

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.860
a shoot of my woman is mentioned

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:10.860
who had confidence in the prophet Elisha.

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.860
She suffered a terrible tragedy in her life.

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.860
Yet she remained calm

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.860
and showed trust in the man of the true God Elisha.

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:24.860
Her example of trust in Jehovah's representative

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:26.860
is worthy of invitation.

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:31.860
In fact, there is an expression she uses in chapter 4

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.860
that conveys the level of trust we want to have in Jehovah

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.860
and his earthly representatives today.

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:42.860
Let me tell you about this woman.

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.860
She and her husband lived in Shunum.

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:49.860
Elisha would regularly make encouraging visits with them

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.860
when he was in that city.

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:55.860
Elisha appreciated their hospitality

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:58.860
and wanted to do something kind for them.

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:00.860
What would he do?

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:05.860
Well, verses 14 through 16 of 2 Kings chapter 4

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:08.860
indicate that she did not have a son

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:11.860
and her husband was old.

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:13.860
So Elisha told her that the next year

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:16.860
she would be embracing a son.

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:19.860
Well, as Elisha foretold,

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:23.860
she gave birth the next year.

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:28.860
But unfortunately, something drastic happened.

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:33.860
The child grew up and one day went out to work with his father.

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:37.860
In verse 19, the boy complained of a headache

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:41.860
which led to his eventual death.

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:43.860
Oh my!

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:45.860
What would this woman do?

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:48.860
This was her only son.

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:53.860
Well, she had confidence in the man of the true God Elisha.

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:57.860
So, she says to her husband in verse 22,

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:01.860
send me, please, one of the attendants and one of the donkeys

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:06.860
and let me go quickly to the man of the true God and return.

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:09.860
In verse 23, her husband asks,

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:13.860
why are you going to see him today?

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:17.860
In other words, what can he do for us?

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:24.860
Note her response at the end of verse 23 and verse 24.

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:26.860
However, she said,

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:30.860
everything is all right.

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:34.860
So she saddled the donkey and said to her attendant,

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:35.860
go quickly.

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:38.860
Do not slow down for me unless I tell you to.

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:42.860
So this calm, trusting woman

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:47.860
rides about 19 miles or 30 kilometers

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:52.860
and finds Elisha and he ends up resurrecting her son.

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:57.860
Her trusting relationship and association with Elisha

00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:00.860
had given her confidence.

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:02.860
Although she experienced a tragedy,

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:07.860
she knew that everything was all right.

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:10.860
Elisha's faith and confidence in Jehovah

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:14.860
helped this devoted woman also to remain calm

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:18.860
and confident when facing adversity.

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:21.860
At Isaiah 41-10,

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:24.860
note Jehovah's assurance,

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:28.860
do not be afraid for I am with you.

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:31.860
Do not be anxious for I am your God.

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:34.860
I will fortify you.

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:37.860
Yes, I will help you.

00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:40.860
I will really hold on to you

00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:43.860
with my right hand of righteousness.

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:46.860
So let's work hard to have unity of mind

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:49.860
with Jehovah's organization

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:53.860
by keeping calm and showing trust in Jehovah

00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:56.860
and being confident that with Jehovah's help

00:08:56.860 --> 00:09:00.860
everything will be all right.

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:03.860
That's a beautiful ingredient

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:06.860
in this recipe for spiritual success.

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:10.460
At 1 Peter 3.8,

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:14.460
Peter next mentions three more ingredients.

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:17.460
They are aspects of love,

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:19.460
fellow feeling,

00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:23.460
brotherly affection, tender compassion.

00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:28.460
These aspects of love convey empathy.

00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:31.460
Empathy is the ability to understand

00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:35.460
and share the feelings of another.

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:38.460
As this system draws to a close,

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:43.460
Satan will try to divide us from within.

00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:46.460
So love for our brothers and sisters

00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:49.460
and empathizing with one another

00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:51.460
will become ever more important.

00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:55.460
It will serve to unify us.

00:09:55.460 --> 00:10:00.460
Think of the empathy of Jehovah's organization.

00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:03.460
We all have personal challenges,

00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:05.460
but so do our overseers,

00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:09.460
those taking the lead in the organization here on Earth.

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:12.460
Some of them have lost loved ones in death,

00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:14.460
just like us.

00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:17.460
Some have experienced sickness and anxiety,

00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:19.460
just like us.

00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:23.460
We love them for their empathy.

00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:27.460
Think about the heavenly part of Jehovah's organization.

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:29.460
Since Satan's rebellion,

00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:31.460
Jehovah has been disappointed,

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:34.460
saddened, angered,

00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:36.460
at the actions of imperfect men.

00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:38.460
These are real feelings

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:42.460
that our empathetic Heavenly Father possesses.

00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:47.460
Jesus experienced similar disappointment and sadness

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:51.460
as he also saw the rebellion of Satan,

00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:54.460
Adam, and Eve and what's resulted.

00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:59.460
In fact, Jesus' understanding became deeper.

00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:04.460
When he became human and began to experience human emotions,

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:09.460
the April 15, 2002 Watchtower article entitled,

00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:13.460
Empathy, Key to Kindness, and Compassion.

00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:17.460
Mention three ways we can sharpen our sensitivity

00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:20.460
to the knees and feelings of others.

00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:22.460
The first.

00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:24.460
Listen.

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:26.460
By listening carefully,

00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:30.460
we learn what problems others face.

00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:32.460
And the better we listen,

00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:35.460
the more likely they will open up their hearts

00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:38.460
and reveal their feelings.

00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:41.460
Second, observe.

00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:45.460
Not everyone will openly tell us how they feel

00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:48.460
or what they are going through.

00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:52.460
A keen observer will notice

00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:54.460
when a fellow Christian needs encouragement

00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:57.460
or some practical assistance.

00:11:57.460 --> 00:12:01.460
Third, use your imagination.

00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:05.460
The most powerful way to stimulate empathy

00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:07.460
is to ask yourself,

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:09.460
if I were in this situation,

00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:11.460
how would I feel?

00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:13.460
How would I respond?

00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:16.460
What would I need?

00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:18.460
So, fellow feeling,

00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:21.460
brotherly affection and tender compassion

00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:24.460
are aspects of loving empathy

00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:28.460
and our valuable ingredients to our spiritual success

00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:33.149
and will benefit others.

00:12:33.149 --> 00:12:37.149
The final quality highlighted in First Peter 3.8

00:12:37.149 --> 00:12:39.149
is humility.

00:12:39.149 --> 00:12:42.149
Why do we need humility?

00:12:42.149 --> 00:12:45.149
Because we need to trust.

00:12:45.149 --> 00:12:48.149
Trust in Jehovah and His organization

00:12:48.149 --> 00:12:51.149
requires humility,

00:12:51.149 --> 00:12:55.149
not relying on our own strength or wisdom.

00:12:55.149 --> 00:12:58.149
Humility helps us to cope

00:12:58.149 --> 00:13:01.149
with whatever God permits.

00:13:01.149 --> 00:13:04.149
When we face anxiety and pressure in our life,

00:13:04.149 --> 00:13:08.149
we may yearn for immediate relief.

00:13:08.149 --> 00:13:11.149
But humility helps us to trust

00:13:11.149 --> 00:13:15.149
that Jehovah knows precisely when

00:13:15.149 --> 00:13:18.149
and how to act in our behalf.

00:13:18.149 --> 00:13:22.149
So, we wait patiently.

00:13:22.149 --> 00:13:26.149
Jehovah always responds to our needs

00:13:26.149 --> 00:13:30.149
in His time and in His way.

00:13:30.149 --> 00:13:32.149
Humility helps us to admit

00:13:32.149 --> 00:13:38.149
that Jehovah's thoughts are vastly superior to our own.

00:13:38.149 --> 00:13:42.149
We recognize our limited discernment

00:13:42.149 --> 00:13:45.149
in comparison with Jehovah's

00:13:45.149 --> 00:13:48.149
all-encompassing perception.

00:13:48.149 --> 00:13:51.149
He sees things we do not discern

00:13:51.149 --> 00:13:56.149
and thus we trust that His way of doing things

00:13:56.149 --> 00:13:59.149
is always best.

00:13:59.149 --> 00:14:02.149
So, as the Great Tribulation approaches,

00:14:02.149 --> 00:14:07.149
humbly trust in Jehovah and His organization.

00:14:08.149 --> 00:14:11.149
First Peter, chapter 5,

00:14:11.149 --> 00:14:15.149
and verse number 6 says this,

00:14:15.149 --> 00:14:17.149
humble yourselves, therefore,

00:14:17.149 --> 00:14:20.149
under the mighty hand of God

00:14:20.149 --> 00:14:24.149
so that He may exalt you in due time.

00:14:24.149 --> 00:14:30.149
Brothers, there is no better place to be

00:14:30.149 --> 00:14:35.149
than under the mighty hand of God.

00:14:35.149 --> 00:14:38.149
Humility is a beautiful ingredient

00:14:38.149 --> 00:14:45.360
that helps us to remain there.

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:48.360
So, what were the ingredients in our recipe

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:51.360
for spiritual success?

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:55.360
First was unity of mind.

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:59.360
Be at unity with Jehovah's organization today

00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:03.360
by keeping calm and showing trust.

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:05.360
In the words of the Shunamaid woman

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:07.360
in King's chapter 4,

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:11.360
when facing adversity always know that with Jehovah,

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:15.360
everything is all right.

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:18.360
Second was fellow feeling,

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:21.360
brotherly affection and tender compassion,

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:25.360
all aspects of loving empathy.

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:29.360
Remember, we're all in this together.

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:32.360
The celestial chariot is empathetic

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:34.360
toward what we face

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:37.360
and what we're drawn to our personal

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:40.360
and organizational needs.

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:45.360
Finally, try always to include humility

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:48.360
in your recipe for success.

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:52.360
Humility requires trust.

00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:56.360
So, trust that Jehovah's way of doing things

00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:59.360
is always best.

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:03.360
Psalm 119 verse 105 says

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:06.360
Bible is a lamp to my foot

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:10.360
and a light for my path.

00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:13.360
So, take time to consider a portion

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:16.360
of God's word each day.

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:21.360
As situations, decisions, and challenges arise,

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:24.360
search for the right recipe,

00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:29.360
Bible example, Christian quality, principal.

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:31.360
When you do,

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:34.360
write up the path ahead of you

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:41.659
and help you to be spiritually successful.

00:16:41.659 --> 00:16:43.659
We've seen that the Bible's recipes

00:16:43.659 --> 00:16:45.659
can make our life spiritually successful

00:16:45.659 --> 00:16:48.659
and help us improve our relationships.

00:16:48.659 --> 00:16:50.659
In the following interview,

00:16:50.659 --> 00:16:54.659
note how applying a recipe of Bible principles

00:16:54.659 --> 00:17:00.659
can also undo the damage caused by poor decisions.

00:17:00.659 --> 00:17:02.659
We graduated in June,

00:17:02.659 --> 00:17:04.660
got married in July,

00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:08.660
had a child and of him.

00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:10.660
Well, it was a happy time.

00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:14.619
At one point,

00:17:14.619 --> 00:17:17.619
two witnesses knocked on my door

00:17:17.619 --> 00:17:21.619
and they showed me Psalm 83-18.

00:17:21.619 --> 00:17:24.619
God's name is Jehovah.

00:17:24.619 --> 00:17:28.930
They offered a Bible study

00:17:28.930 --> 00:17:33.930
but my study only lasted two to three weeks.

00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:37.779
We got a car.

00:17:37.779 --> 00:17:40.779
We started going to parties,

00:17:40.779 --> 00:17:42.779
starting to smoke,

00:17:42.779 --> 00:17:45.779
have drugs, getting drunk.

00:17:45.779 --> 00:17:47.779
We did all these things

00:17:47.779 --> 00:17:50.779
that really tore our marriage apart.

00:17:50.779 --> 00:17:53.779
We thought moving away from our town

00:17:53.779 --> 00:17:57.779
and our old associates would help.

00:17:57.779 --> 00:18:04.890
It was worse than ever.

00:18:04.890 --> 00:18:07.890
Baseball was more important to me

00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:10.890
than even my wife.

00:18:10.890 --> 00:18:14.890
I had a real problem with headshot.

00:18:14.890 --> 00:18:17.890
There were times when

00:18:17.890 --> 00:18:20.890
I felt like I was smarter than him.

00:18:20.890 --> 00:18:23.890
So I felt like I could make a better decision

00:18:23.890 --> 00:18:28.869
than he could make.

00:18:28.869 --> 00:18:30.869
In time,

00:18:30.869 --> 00:18:32.869
Zaina left me

00:18:32.869 --> 00:18:34.869
for another person

00:18:34.869 --> 00:18:36.869
and that's

00:18:36.869 --> 00:18:40.660
what really hurt me.

00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:42.660
Zaina had a hard time

00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:44.660
with drugs and so forth.

00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:52.720
That's when I got custody of the kids.

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:55.720
I decided at that moment

00:18:55.720 --> 00:19:01.049
I was done.

00:19:01.049 --> 00:19:04.359
And Jehovah

00:19:04.359 --> 00:19:08.359
popped into my head.

00:19:08.359 --> 00:19:11.359
I remember

00:19:11.359 --> 00:19:13.359
getting down

00:19:13.359 --> 00:19:17.359
and telling Jehovah

00:19:17.359 --> 00:19:19.359
just show me,

00:19:19.359 --> 00:19:21.359
show me what to do.

00:19:21.359 --> 00:19:25.359
I went through the telephone book

00:19:25.359 --> 00:19:29.359
and looked up Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:19:29.359 --> 00:19:33.359
They gave me a book,

00:19:33.359 --> 00:19:37.359
a family life book.

00:19:37.359 --> 00:19:39.359
I showed him that book

00:19:39.359 --> 00:19:43.980
and I told him,

00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:46.980
had we applied this

00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:48.980
in our marriage

00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:49.980
from the beginning,

00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:52.980
our marriage would have never

00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:54.980
broke up.

00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:56.980
My mind was going

00:19:56.980 --> 00:19:59.980
really, really,

00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:02.980
but I see she was doing things

00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:06.809
in a spiritual way.

00:20:06.809 --> 00:20:09.809
She stopped doing drugs

00:20:09.809 --> 00:20:12.809
and I just saw her

00:20:12.809 --> 00:20:15.809
mannerism change

00:20:15.809 --> 00:20:17.809
and that short period of time

00:20:17.809 --> 00:20:19.809
things got better

00:20:19.809 --> 00:20:20.809
and better.

00:20:20.809 --> 00:20:22.809
And then I started studying

00:20:22.809 --> 00:20:25.809
the Bible with Zaina.

00:20:25.809 --> 00:20:28.809
That's when things start

00:20:28.809 --> 00:20:30.809
click it.

00:20:30.809 --> 00:20:32.809
One of the scriptures

00:20:32.809 --> 00:20:34.809
that helped me to rebuild

00:20:34.809 --> 00:20:35.809
our marriage

00:20:35.809 --> 00:20:38.809
is first Corinthians

00:20:38.809 --> 00:20:40.809
113.

00:20:40.809 --> 00:20:42.809
Art is my head.

00:20:42.809 --> 00:20:44.809
I am not the head.

00:20:44.809 --> 00:20:46.809
Knowing that everybody

00:20:46.809 --> 00:20:49.809
but Jehovah has a head,

00:20:49.809 --> 00:20:52.809
I've used that

00:20:52.809 --> 00:20:55.809
as a protection.

00:20:55.809 --> 00:20:58.809
Now I don't have to make decisions

00:20:58.809 --> 00:21:02.920
on my own.

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:04.920
Galatians chapter 5

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:07.920
verse 22, 23.

00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:10.920
That helped me to show love

00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:13.920
to be a better husband,

00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:16.920
a better father

00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:20.920
and I always

00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:22.920
treated like a lady.

00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:24.920
Listen to her viewpoints

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:26.920
and things like that.

00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:28.920
I remarried Arthur

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:30.920
on April 2nd,

00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:34.460
1979.

00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:36.460
I would tell someone who is struggling

00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:38.460
in their marriage now.

00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:40.460
Apply

00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:43.460
Bible principles.

00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:49.460
Apply them.

00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:51.460
We learn to be a family

00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:53.460
with Jehovah

00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:55.460
and that's why we can deal

00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:56.460
with the problems

00:21:56.460 --> 00:21:57.460
that we have to face

00:21:57.460 --> 00:21:59.460
every day.

00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:00.460
The second time around

00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:03.460
is so much sweeter

00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:04.460
with Jehovah

00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:08.859
in the picture.

00:22:08.859 --> 00:22:10.859
It's amazing, isn't it?

00:22:10.859 --> 00:22:12.859
How learning and applying

00:22:12.859 --> 00:22:13.859
Bible principles

00:22:13.859 --> 00:22:15.859
and keeping Jehovah

00:22:15.859 --> 00:22:16.859
in the picture

00:22:16.859 --> 00:22:17.859
made such a difference

00:22:17.859 --> 00:22:19.859
for art and Zana.

00:22:19.859 --> 00:22:22.859
That's why we exert ourselves

00:22:22.859 --> 00:22:23.859
to bring God's Word

00:22:23.859 --> 00:22:27.859
to as many as possible.

00:22:27.859 --> 00:22:29.859
This includes helping people

00:22:29.859 --> 00:22:30.859
hear the truth

00:22:30.859 --> 00:22:33.859
in the language of their heart.

00:22:33.859 --> 00:22:36.859
I know you'll enjoy our next segment

00:22:36.859 --> 00:22:38.859
on how a publishing innovation

00:22:38.859 --> 00:22:40.859
invented by our brothers years ago

00:22:40.859 --> 00:22:42.859
has accelerated the translation

00:22:42.859 --> 00:22:43.859
of the good news

00:22:43.859 --> 00:22:45.859
leading to the greatest

00:22:45.859 --> 00:22:49.559
witness in history.

00:22:49.559 --> 00:22:51.559
Jehovah's Witnesses

00:22:51.559 --> 00:22:52.559
are known for publishing

00:22:52.559 --> 00:22:54.559
in hundreds of languages.

00:22:54.559 --> 00:22:55.559
With a website

00:22:55.559 --> 00:22:57.559
recognized as the most widely

00:22:57.559 --> 00:22:59.559
translated in the world.

00:22:59.559 --> 00:23:01.559
But have you ever wondered

00:23:01.559 --> 00:23:03.559
how we're able to release

00:23:03.559 --> 00:23:04.559
our literature

00:23:04.559 --> 00:23:05.559
and print it online

00:23:05.559 --> 00:23:07.559
and so many languages at once?

00:23:07.559 --> 00:23:09.559
The answer involves

00:23:09.559 --> 00:23:11.559
a cutting-edge publishing system

00:23:11.559 --> 00:23:13.559
that our brothers developed

00:23:13.559 --> 00:23:15.559
more than 40 years ago,

00:23:15.559 --> 00:23:17.559
a breakthrough in publishing

00:23:17.559 --> 00:23:19.559
called Maps.

00:23:19.559 --> 00:23:22.559
But just what is Maps?

00:23:22.559 --> 00:23:23.559
Let's find out

00:23:23.559 --> 00:23:25.559
and see how this technology

00:23:25.559 --> 00:23:28.559
has helped to unite Jehovah's people

00:23:28.559 --> 00:23:29.559
and has opened the way

00:23:29.559 --> 00:23:30.559
for us to give

00:23:30.559 --> 00:23:43.900
the greatest witness in history.

00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:44.900
God's people

00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:45.900
have long understood

00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:47.900
the need to share the truth

00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:50.900
in as many languages as possible.

00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:53.900
Revelation 14.6

00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:54.900
prophesied

00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:55.900
that the good news

00:23:55.900 --> 00:23:56.900
would be preached

00:23:56.900 --> 00:23:57.900
to every nation

00:23:57.900 --> 00:23:59.900
and tribe and tongue

00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:01.900
and people.

00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:02.900
So as far back

00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:04.900
as the late 1800s,

00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:05.900
the early Bible students

00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:07.900
translated our literature

00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:09.900
into languages other than English

00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:11.900
so that people could learn the truth

00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:13.900
in their mother tongue.

00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:15.900
But for decades,

00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:16.900
publishing the good news

00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:18.900
in many languages

00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:21.900
was a labor-intensive process.

00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:22.900
Imagine yourself

00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:24.900
working at a Bethel-Printry

00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:26.900
decades ago.

00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:27.900
It's hot

00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:29.900
and loud.

00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:30.900
Printing required

00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:32.900
the use of a liner type machine,

00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:34.900
which turned molten lead

00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:36.900
into small metal slabs

00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:37.900
of type,

00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:38.900
called slugs,

00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:41.900
one line at a time.

00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:43.900
Workers had to

00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:45.900
meticulously compose pages

00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:47.900
by arranging the slugs

00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:49.900
into large metal frames

00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:50.900
that were used

00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:52.900
to make special embossed mats.

00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:54.900
Then more hot metal was used

00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:56.900
to cast printing plates

00:24:56.900 --> 00:24:58.900
from the mats.

00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:00.900
And for long press runs,

00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:01.900
the plates then

00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:02.900
had to be electroplated

00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:05.900
with nickel to harden them.

00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:06.900
Finally,

00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:08.900
after removing any irregularities,

00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:09.900
the plates were ready

00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:10.900
to be mounted

00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:13.900
on a large rotary printing press.

00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:15.900
Publishing the same material

00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:17.900
in another language

00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:19.900
meant repeating these pre-press steps

00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:22.900
from beginning to end.

00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:24.900
It took months

00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:26.900
for a single magazine

00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:27.900
to be translated

00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:28.900
from English,

00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:29.900
typeset,

00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:30.900
and printed.

00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:32.900
For books,

00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:34.900
it could take years.

00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:38.140
The days of hot metal

00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:40.140
were quickly ending.

00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:42.140
The printing industry

00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:43.140
began adopting the use

00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:45.140
of photo-type setting

00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:48.140
and offset presses.

00:25:48.140 --> 00:25:49.140
It was time

00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:51.140
to modernize operations

00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:52.140
at Bethel

00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:54.140
and make the transition

00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:56.140
to computers.

00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:57.140
But the brothers faced

00:25:57.140 --> 00:25:59.140
a unique challenge.

00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:01.140
At this point,

00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:03.140
we were already printing literature

00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:06.140
in 167 languages.

00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:08.140
So we needed a solution

00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:10.140
that could handle all those languages

00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:11.140
and more,

00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:12.140
and not one

00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:14.140
of the commercially available systems

00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:18.059
could do that.

00:26:18.059 --> 00:26:20.059
So in 1979,

00:26:20.059 --> 00:26:22.059
a group of brothers and sisters

00:26:22.059 --> 00:26:23.059
were called

00:26:23.059 --> 00:26:24.059
to wash tower farms

00:26:24.059 --> 00:26:27.059
in Wal-Kill, New York.

00:26:27.059 --> 00:26:29.059
To develop a multi-language

00:26:29.059 --> 00:26:31.059
electronic photo-type setting system,

00:26:31.059 --> 00:26:34.059
or MEPs.

00:26:34.059 --> 00:26:36.059
So we got to work

00:26:36.059 --> 00:26:37.059
on building MEPs.

00:26:37.059 --> 00:26:39.059
Some brothers and sisters

00:26:39.059 --> 00:26:40.059
were treated on the hardware,

00:26:40.059 --> 00:26:42.059
the actual circuitry,

00:26:42.059 --> 00:26:43.059
other brothers

00:26:43.059 --> 00:26:44.059
concentrated on the screen itself

00:26:44.059 --> 00:26:46.059
and building that,

00:26:46.059 --> 00:26:47.059
and then others of us

00:26:47.059 --> 00:26:48.059
concentrated on the software,

00:26:48.059 --> 00:26:49.059
the operating system,

00:26:49.059 --> 00:26:51.059
you might say.

00:26:51.059 --> 00:26:52.059
The MEPs team

00:26:52.059 --> 00:26:54.059
designed and built

00:26:54.059 --> 00:26:56.059
almost everything.

00:26:56.059 --> 00:26:57.059
Computers,

00:26:57.059 --> 00:26:58.059
keyboards,

00:26:58.059 --> 00:26:59.059
screens,

00:26:59.059 --> 00:27:00.059
and software.

00:27:00.059 --> 00:27:02.059
They had to.

00:27:02.059 --> 00:27:03.059
Personal computers

00:27:03.059 --> 00:27:04.059
with the power needed

00:27:04.059 --> 00:27:06.059
still weren't available,

00:27:06.059 --> 00:27:07.059
and wouldn't be

00:27:07.059 --> 00:27:10.059
for another few years.

00:27:10.059 --> 00:27:11.059
Another massive part

00:27:11.059 --> 00:27:12.059
of the project involved

00:27:12.059 --> 00:27:14.059
creating the fonts.

00:27:14.059 --> 00:27:15.059
The individual letters

00:27:15.059 --> 00:27:17.059
used to make up the pages

00:27:17.059 --> 00:27:19.059
of text.

00:27:19.059 --> 00:27:20.059
Commercial fonts

00:27:20.059 --> 00:27:22.059
weren't available,

00:27:22.059 --> 00:27:23.059
or were too expensive

00:27:23.059 --> 00:27:26.059
for many of the languages needed.

00:27:26.059 --> 00:27:27.059
So brothers and sisters

00:27:27.059 --> 00:27:30.059
had to draw each character

00:27:30.059 --> 00:27:32.059
by hand,

00:27:32.059 --> 00:27:35.890
and scan them into the computer.

00:27:35.890 --> 00:27:36.890
For some languages,

00:27:36.890 --> 00:27:38.890
this meant drawing

00:27:38.890 --> 00:27:40.890
thousands of characters.

00:27:40.890 --> 00:27:42.890
The software then had to be

00:27:42.890 --> 00:27:44.890
programmed with all the rules

00:27:44.890 --> 00:27:46.890
for spacing and hyphenation,

00:27:46.890 --> 00:27:48.890
so that words and characters

00:27:48.890 --> 00:27:50.890
could be displayed correctly.

00:27:50.890 --> 00:27:52.890
Just three years

00:27:52.890 --> 00:27:54.890
after the project began,

00:27:54.890 --> 00:27:56.890
the first MEPs unit

00:27:56.890 --> 00:27:59.890
was completed in 1982.

00:27:59.890 --> 00:28:01.890
With MEPs,

00:28:01.890 --> 00:28:03.890
an operator could enter text

00:28:03.890 --> 00:28:04.890
at a computer workstation

00:28:04.890 --> 00:28:07.890
in any supported language.

00:28:07.890 --> 00:28:08.890
After this,

00:28:08.890 --> 00:28:09.890
the workstation could be used

00:28:09.890 --> 00:28:10.890
to format the text

00:28:10.890 --> 00:28:13.890
and compose pages.

00:28:13.890 --> 00:28:15.890
This approach

00:28:15.890 --> 00:28:16.890
allowed the brothers

00:28:16.890 --> 00:28:18.890
to use a single-page layout

00:28:18.890 --> 00:28:20.890
to produce the same publication

00:28:20.890 --> 00:28:23.890
for all languages.

00:28:23.890 --> 00:28:25.890
The final pages were then rendered

00:28:25.890 --> 00:28:27.890
on photographic paper,

00:28:27.890 --> 00:28:29.890
transferred to film,

00:28:29.890 --> 00:28:32.890
and used to make printing plates.

00:28:32.890 --> 00:28:34.890
MEPs didn't do the translation

00:28:34.890 --> 00:28:35.890
itself.

00:28:35.890 --> 00:28:36.890
That was,

00:28:36.890 --> 00:28:38.890
and still is,

00:28:38.890 --> 00:28:40.890
a job for human translators.

00:28:40.890 --> 00:28:42.890
But it allowed all the

00:28:42.890 --> 00:28:44.890
pre-press work to be completed

00:28:44.890 --> 00:28:46.890
in a fraction of the time.

00:28:46.890 --> 00:28:48.890
And MEPs achieved

00:28:48.890 --> 00:28:50.890
something even more important

00:28:50.890 --> 00:28:52.890
than increased speed and efficiency.

00:28:52.890 --> 00:28:54.890
It addressed a global

00:28:54.890 --> 00:28:56.890
spiritual need.

00:28:56.890 --> 00:28:58.890
Even before the MEPs

00:28:58.890 --> 00:28:59.890
project began,

00:28:59.890 --> 00:29:00.890
the governing body

00:29:00.890 --> 00:29:01.890
realized

00:29:01.890 --> 00:29:02.890
that if Jehovah's Witnesses

00:29:02.890 --> 00:29:04.890
worldwide could somehow

00:29:04.890 --> 00:29:06.890
study the same material

00:29:06.890 --> 00:29:08.890
each week at meetings,

00:29:08.890 --> 00:29:09.890
it would unite them

00:29:09.890 --> 00:29:11.890
as never before.

00:29:11.890 --> 00:29:12.890
And it was clear

00:29:12.890 --> 00:29:13.890
that with MEPs,

00:29:13.890 --> 00:29:15.890
along with faster presses

00:29:15.890 --> 00:29:16.890
and other adjustments

00:29:16.890 --> 00:29:17.890
in production,

00:29:17.890 --> 00:29:19.890
this could finally

00:29:19.890 --> 00:29:21.890
become a reality.

00:29:21.890 --> 00:29:23.890
In fact, so much time

00:29:23.890 --> 00:29:24.890
to be saved

00:29:24.890 --> 00:29:26.890
in this projected operation,

00:29:26.890 --> 00:29:27.890
that someday

00:29:27.890 --> 00:29:28.890
we might be able

00:29:28.890 --> 00:29:30.890
to bring out the rough path

00:29:30.890 --> 00:29:32.890
in all principal languages,

00:29:32.890 --> 00:29:34.890
with each data issue

00:29:34.890 --> 00:29:35.890
containing

00:29:35.890 --> 00:29:36.890
exactly the same

00:29:36.890 --> 00:29:37.890
spiritual feed

00:29:37.890 --> 00:29:38.890
for the brothers

00:29:38.890 --> 00:29:40.890
all around the world.

00:29:40.890 --> 00:29:42.890
The April 1st,

00:29:42.890 --> 00:29:44.890
1984 issue of the Watchtower,

00:29:44.890 --> 00:29:46.890
became the first

00:29:46.890 --> 00:29:47.890
to be published

00:29:47.890 --> 00:29:48.890
in multiple languages

00:29:48.890 --> 00:29:50.890
simultaneously.

00:29:50.890 --> 00:29:52.890
In just the next year,

00:29:52.890 --> 00:29:54.890
the number of simultaneous

00:29:54.890 --> 00:29:56.890
languages grew to 23,

00:29:57.890 --> 00:29:59.890
and by 2021,

00:29:59.890 --> 00:30:00.890
the study addition

00:30:00.890 --> 00:30:01.890
of the Watchtower

00:30:01.890 --> 00:30:02.890
was being published

00:30:02.890 --> 00:30:03.890
simultaneously

00:30:03.890 --> 00:30:08.890
in more than 390 languages.

00:30:08.890 --> 00:30:09.890
Almost all

00:30:09.890 --> 00:30:10.890
of Jehovah's Witnesses

00:30:10.890 --> 00:30:12.890
are now able to study

00:30:12.890 --> 00:30:13.890
the same spiritual food

00:30:13.890 --> 00:30:14.890
at our meetings

00:30:14.890 --> 00:30:16.890
at the same time,

00:30:16.890 --> 00:30:20.890
truly a modern-day miracle.

00:30:20.890 --> 00:30:22.890
Today, MEPs does a lot

00:30:22.890 --> 00:30:23.890
more than typesetting.

00:30:23.890 --> 00:30:24.890
It's grown

00:30:24.890 --> 00:30:26.890
to become a full set

00:30:26.890 --> 00:30:28.890
of publishing tools.

00:30:28.890 --> 00:30:29.890
MEPs programming

00:30:29.890 --> 00:30:31.890
paved the way

00:30:31.890 --> 00:30:32.890
for Watchtower Library

00:30:32.890 --> 00:30:34.890
on CD-ROM

00:30:34.890 --> 00:30:35.890
and contributed

00:30:35.890 --> 00:30:36.890
to the development

00:30:36.890 --> 00:30:38.890
of the JW Library app.

00:30:38.890 --> 00:30:39.890
In fact,

00:30:39.890 --> 00:30:40.890
the MEPs acronym

00:30:40.890 --> 00:30:41.890
now stands

00:30:41.890 --> 00:30:43.890
for multi-language

00:30:43.890 --> 00:30:46.890
electronic publishing system,

00:30:46.890 --> 00:30:47.890
because it drives

00:30:47.890 --> 00:30:48.890
our publishing

00:30:48.890 --> 00:30:49.890
both imprint

00:30:49.890 --> 00:30:51.890
and online.

00:30:51.890 --> 00:30:52.890
In the end,

00:30:52.890 --> 00:30:53.890
the story of MEPs

00:30:53.890 --> 00:30:54.890
is more than a story

00:30:54.890 --> 00:30:56.890
of technology.

00:30:56.890 --> 00:30:59.890
It's one of love.

00:30:59.890 --> 00:31:01.890
Love moved the governing body,

00:31:01.890 --> 00:31:02.890
to seek better ways

00:31:02.890 --> 00:31:04.890
to provide spiritual food

00:31:04.890 --> 00:31:06.890
to people of every tribe

00:31:06.890 --> 00:31:08.890
and tongue.

00:31:08.890 --> 00:31:10.890
As a result of that love,

00:31:10.890 --> 00:31:12.890
and with Jehovah's Holy Spirit,

00:31:12.890 --> 00:31:15.890
we now enjoy unprecedented unity

00:31:15.890 --> 00:31:16.890
and the ability

00:31:16.890 --> 00:31:18.890
to preach the good news

00:31:18.890 --> 00:31:19.890
on a scale

00:31:19.890 --> 00:31:32.420
never before possible.

00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:34.420
From molten metal slabs

00:31:34.420 --> 00:31:35.420
of type

00:31:35.420 --> 00:31:37.420
to computerized publishing,

00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:39.420
the development of MEPs

00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:41.420
has been a real blessing.

00:31:41.420 --> 00:31:44.420
It's helped unify Jehovah's people

00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:46.420
as we preach the good news

00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:48.420
in all the inhabited earth

00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:49.420
for a witness

00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:51.420
to all the nations.

00:31:51.420 --> 00:31:54.700
But what if we face a situation

00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:56.700
where we personally began

00:31:56.700 --> 00:31:57.700
to wonder

00:31:57.700 --> 00:32:00.700
if Jehovah is blessing us?

00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:02.700
Let's see how lessons

00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:04.700
from the life of John the Baptist

00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:06.700
can help us remain certain

00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:08.700
of Jehovah's love

00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:10.700
and protection.

00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:18.809
I knew this day would come.

00:32:18.809 --> 00:32:23.230
True Christians

00:32:23.230 --> 00:32:25.230
expect opposition,

00:32:25.230 --> 00:32:29.180
but it hurt to see

00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:31.180
other vassals get arrested.

00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:48.380
After what happened,

00:32:48.380 --> 00:32:52.480
I was scared to talk

00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:54.480
about Jehovah.

00:32:54.480 --> 00:33:14.500
Marcos has been looking

00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:17.500
for work for months.

00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:19.500
It's starting to feel

00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:21.500
hopeless.

00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:32.490
I appreciate that he supports

00:33:32.490 --> 00:33:34.490
me in the pioneer ministry.

00:33:34.490 --> 00:33:38.960
But shouldn't he focus

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:40.960
on finding work?

00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:51.369
I was so happy

00:33:51.369 --> 00:33:52.369
when I heard Nicole

00:33:52.369 --> 00:33:54.369
got invited to SKE.

00:33:54.369 --> 00:34:00.500
But as I kept thinking

00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:01.500
about it,

00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:03.500
I started to feel

00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:05.500
empty,

00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:08.500
disappointed.

00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:09.500
Other seemed to get

00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:13.159
so many privileges.

00:34:13.159 --> 00:34:14.159
Why not me?

00:34:14.159 --> 00:34:24.349
In my Bible reading,

00:34:24.349 --> 00:34:26.349
I found an example of courage

00:34:26.349 --> 00:34:27.349
to preach boldly

00:34:27.349 --> 00:34:32.360
despite opposition.

00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:33.360
After I told Marcos

00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:35.360
how I was feeling,

00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:37.360
we considered a Bible character

00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:39.360
who endured with hope.

00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:45.679
Jesus said,

00:34:45.679 --> 00:34:47.679
among those born of women,

00:34:47.679 --> 00:34:48.679
there has not been raised

00:34:48.679 --> 00:34:50.679
up anyone greater

00:34:50.679 --> 00:35:00.619
than John the Baptist.

00:35:00.619 --> 00:35:01.619
Many that listen to him

00:35:01.619 --> 00:35:02.619
were moved to repent

00:35:02.619 --> 00:35:05.619
and get baptized.

00:35:05.619 --> 00:35:06.619
Preparing their hearts

00:35:06.619 --> 00:35:08.619
to receive the Messiah,

00:35:08.619 --> 00:35:17.500
he even baptized the

00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:27.380
Son of God.

00:35:27.380 --> 00:35:29.380
But as Jesus ministry increased,

00:35:29.380 --> 00:35:32.380
John's began to decrease.

00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:34.380
When his disciples pointed

00:35:34.380 --> 00:35:35.380
that out to John,

00:35:35.380 --> 00:35:38.750
he humbly rejoiced

00:35:38.750 --> 00:35:39.750
at what Jehovah

00:35:39.750 --> 00:35:41.750
was accomplishing through Jesus.

00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:47.889
However, John faced adversity,

00:35:47.889 --> 00:35:48.889
just like worshipers

00:35:48.889 --> 00:35:59.530
of Jehovah today.

00:35:59.530 --> 00:36:00.530
John was imprisoned

00:36:00.530 --> 00:36:02.530
for boldly declaring the truth.

00:36:03.530 --> 00:36:15.260
Nothing prevented him

00:36:15.260 --> 00:36:21.809
from preaching courageously.

00:36:21.809 --> 00:36:22.809
As time passed,

00:36:22.809 --> 00:36:26.809
and he remained in prison,

00:36:26.809 --> 00:36:28.809
John needed reassurance,

00:36:28.809 --> 00:36:54.139
just like I do.

00:36:54.139 --> 00:36:55.139
His disciples returned

00:36:55.139 --> 00:36:57.139
with a message from Jesus.

00:36:57.139 --> 00:37:01.699
Observe what Jehovah

00:37:01.699 --> 00:37:04.699
is accomplishing around you.

00:37:04.699 --> 00:37:54.880
Now I see what Jehovah

00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:56.880
is accomplishing around me.

00:37:56.880 --> 00:38:08.809
I can imitate John the Baptist,

00:38:08.809 --> 00:38:10.809
and endure with hope.

00:38:10.809 --> 00:38:20.010
I have so many reasons

00:38:20.010 --> 00:38:22.010
to be joyful.

00:38:22.010 --> 00:38:23.010
Among them,

00:38:23.010 --> 00:38:25.010
seen Jehovah use others

00:38:25.010 --> 00:38:44.960
to accomplish his will.

00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:46.960
People need to learn about Jehovah.

00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:50.139
Like John,

00:38:50.139 --> 00:38:51.139
I can have courage,

00:38:51.139 --> 00:38:54.139
no matter what adversity I may face.

00:38:54.139 --> 00:39:05.550
Excellent lessons for us all.

00:39:05.550 --> 00:39:08.550
One sister was overly concerned

00:39:08.550 --> 00:39:11.550
about her husband finding employment.

00:39:11.550 --> 00:39:13.550
But she later realized

00:39:13.550 --> 00:39:15.550
the value of him keeping up

00:39:15.550 --> 00:39:17.550
his spiritual routine

00:39:17.550 --> 00:39:19.550
in the ministry with her.

00:39:19.550 --> 00:39:21.550
Another sister felt empty

00:39:21.550 --> 00:39:23.550
and disappointed.

00:39:23.550 --> 00:39:25.550
But she learned to rejoice.

00:39:25.550 --> 00:39:27.550
As did John,

00:39:27.550 --> 00:39:29.550
in seeing Jehovah use others

00:39:29.550 --> 00:39:32.550
to advance Kingdom interests.

00:39:32.550 --> 00:39:33.550
And our brother,

00:39:33.550 --> 00:39:35.550
who faced persecution,

00:39:35.550 --> 00:39:37.550
learned to overcome his fear

00:39:37.550 --> 00:39:41.789
and speak up.

00:39:41.789 --> 00:39:44.789
Often in lands where our work is banned,

00:39:44.789 --> 00:39:46.789
propaganda are spread

00:39:46.789 --> 00:39:49.789
to justify persecution.

00:39:49.789 --> 00:39:52.789
But it's not just in such lands

00:39:52.789 --> 00:39:54.789
where we face false reports,

00:39:54.789 --> 00:39:55.789
misinformation,

00:39:55.789 --> 00:39:57.789
and outright lies.

00:39:57.789 --> 00:39:59.789
In fact,

00:39:59.789 --> 00:40:01.789
even though we bear the truth,

00:40:01.789 --> 00:40:03.789
apostates and others

00:40:03.789 --> 00:40:06.789
may cast us as dishonest,

00:40:06.789 --> 00:40:08.789
as deceivers.

00:40:08.789 --> 00:40:10.789
How can we respond

00:40:10.789 --> 00:40:12.789
to that unfair treatment?

00:40:12.789 --> 00:40:15.789
Let's listen to brother Seth Hyatt's

00:40:15.789 --> 00:40:17.789
recent morning worship discussion,

00:40:17.789 --> 00:40:19.789
speaking truth,

00:40:19.789 --> 00:40:22.789
though labeled as deceivers.

00:40:22.789 --> 00:40:25.789
Have you ever been confronted

00:40:25.789 --> 00:40:28.789
by a bad report,

00:40:28.789 --> 00:40:33.139
a false report

00:40:33.139 --> 00:40:37.309
about Jehovah's people?

00:40:37.309 --> 00:40:40.309
It may be a newspaper article

00:40:40.309 --> 00:40:43.309
or a segment on the evening news

00:40:43.309 --> 00:40:45.309
or perhaps some subject

00:40:45.309 --> 00:40:48.309
is brought up in the ministry.

00:40:48.309 --> 00:40:51.309
It could be a broad range of subjects.

00:40:51.309 --> 00:40:54.309
Our neutral stand,

00:40:54.309 --> 00:40:56.309
our stand on blood,

00:40:56.309 --> 00:41:01.309
our adherence to Jehovah's elevated moral standards

00:41:01.309 --> 00:41:05.309
and appreciation for the sanctity of marriage,

00:41:05.309 --> 00:41:07.309
or our insistence

00:41:07.309 --> 00:41:10.309
on keeping the congregation clean

00:41:10.309 --> 00:41:14.309
by disfellowshipping unrepentant wrongdoers.

00:41:14.309 --> 00:41:17.309
But whatever the subject,

00:41:17.309 --> 00:41:20.309
there are some commonalities.

00:41:20.309 --> 00:41:23.309
Such reports

00:41:23.309 --> 00:41:26.309
are often characterized by distortions,

00:41:26.309 --> 00:41:28.309
inaccuracies,

00:41:28.309 --> 00:41:33.309
and sometimes outright falsehood.

00:41:33.309 --> 00:41:35.309
And inevitably,

00:41:35.309 --> 00:41:38.309
they're presented with certainty

00:41:38.309 --> 00:41:40.309
and surety,

00:41:40.309 --> 00:41:43.750
as though they were fact.

00:41:43.750 --> 00:41:47.750
When you're confronted with such a report,

00:41:47.750 --> 00:41:49.750
how do you feel?

00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:51.750
Disheartened,

00:41:51.750 --> 00:41:55.320
discouraged,

00:41:55.320 --> 00:41:57.320
angry?

00:41:57.320 --> 00:42:01.320
Consider the experience of a pioneer sister,

00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:04.320
who was conducting a Bible study,

00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:07.320
and in the course of conducting this study,

00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:10.320
a woman walked into the house,

00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:12.320
unannounced,

00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:14.320
she didn't ring the doorbell,

00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:16.320
didn't knock,

00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:18.320
and as it turned out,

00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:20.320
in a acquaintance of the student,

00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:22.320
she walked right in

00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:24.320
and erupted the Bible study,

00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:27.320
and in her hand was a book,

00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:29.320
written by a man

00:42:29.320 --> 00:42:31.320
who at one time had associated

00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:33.320
with Jehovah's people.

00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:36.320
The woman said to the student,

00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:40.630
you need to read this book,

00:42:40.630 --> 00:42:42.630
reading conversation and sued,

00:42:42.630 --> 00:42:46.630
and our sister found herself in the position

00:42:46.630 --> 00:42:51.630
of being cast in the role of a deceiver.

00:42:51.630 --> 00:42:55.630
How did she handle that situation?

00:42:55.630 --> 00:42:59.630
And how did the Bible student respond?

00:42:59.630 --> 00:43:02.630
Well, before we answer that question,

00:43:02.630 --> 00:43:05.630
let's see how the words of today's text

00:43:05.630 --> 00:43:08.630
and surrounding verses

00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:11.630
that can help us to have the proper view.

00:43:11.630 --> 00:43:12.630
Look if you would please

00:43:12.630 --> 00:43:18.449
at 2 Corinthians chapter 6,

00:43:18.449 --> 00:43:21.449
and notice verse 4,

00:43:21.449 --> 00:43:23.449
Paul says in every way

00:43:23.449 --> 00:43:27.449
we recommend ourselves as God's ministers.

00:43:27.449 --> 00:43:30.449
Now what follows is a lengthy series

00:43:30.449 --> 00:43:33.449
of circumstances and situations

00:43:33.449 --> 00:43:37.449
that the Apostle Paul faced in his ministry,

00:43:37.449 --> 00:43:39.449
and that faithful Christians

00:43:39.449 --> 00:43:43.449
have faced in their ministry ever since.

00:43:43.449 --> 00:43:46.449
In verse 7, the words of today's text,

00:43:46.449 --> 00:43:49.449
we recommend ourselves as God's ministers

00:43:49.449 --> 00:43:52.449
by truthful speech.

00:43:52.449 --> 00:43:54.449
Well, we worship Jehovah,

00:43:54.449 --> 00:43:56.449
the God of truth.

00:43:56.449 --> 00:43:59.449
And we take delight in that.

00:43:59.449 --> 00:44:02.449
And as our watchtower comment makes the point,

00:44:02.449 --> 00:44:04.449
that we're truthful

00:44:04.449 --> 00:44:07.449
in things big and small.

00:44:07.449 --> 00:44:09.449
We love the truth.

00:44:09.449 --> 00:44:14.730
We love telling the truth about Jehovah.

00:44:14.730 --> 00:44:16.730
So it's interesting to note

00:44:16.730 --> 00:44:19.730
Paul's words in verse 8.

00:44:19.730 --> 00:44:23.730
He says through glory and dishonor,

00:44:23.730 --> 00:44:27.730
through bad report and good report.

00:44:27.730 --> 00:44:29.730
And then this intriguing statement,

00:44:29.730 --> 00:44:33.730
we are regarded as deceivers,

00:44:33.730 --> 00:44:37.730
and yet we are truthful.

00:44:37.730 --> 00:44:40.730
Now that's an interesting paradox, isn't it?

00:44:40.730 --> 00:44:44.730
To be truthful and yet cast in the role

00:44:44.730 --> 00:44:48.460
of a deceiver.

00:44:48.460 --> 00:44:52.460
When we are confronted with a negative report

00:44:52.460 --> 00:44:55.460
that does that to Jehovah's people,

00:44:55.460 --> 00:44:58.460
it's good to remember that Jehovah

00:44:58.460 --> 00:45:02.460
was the first target of such an attack.

00:45:02.460 --> 00:45:08.139
Look in your Bible at Genesis chapter 3,

00:45:08.139 --> 00:45:11.139
beginning in verse 1.

00:45:11.139 --> 00:45:13.139
Now the serpent was the most cautious

00:45:13.139 --> 00:45:16.139
of all the wild animals of the field

00:45:16.139 --> 00:45:19.139
that Jehovah had made.

00:45:19.139 --> 00:45:22.139
So it said to the woman,

00:45:22.139 --> 00:45:25.139
did God really say

00:45:25.139 --> 00:45:29.139
that you must not eat from every tree of the garden?

00:45:29.139 --> 00:45:32.139
Now we learned something about Satan's method.

00:45:32.139 --> 00:45:34.139
He didn't begin with a statement.

00:45:34.139 --> 00:45:37.139
He began with a question.

00:45:37.139 --> 00:45:39.139
And not just a question.

00:45:39.139 --> 00:45:41.139
A question that was designed

00:45:41.139 --> 00:45:45.139
to sow seeds of doubt.

00:45:45.139 --> 00:45:48.139
Did God really say that?

00:45:48.139 --> 00:45:50.139
Now in verses 2 and 3,

00:45:50.139 --> 00:45:51.139
the woman responds.

00:45:51.139 --> 00:45:53.139
Toward the close of verse 3,

00:45:53.139 --> 00:45:57.139
she actually quotes Jehovah's command.

00:45:57.139 --> 00:45:59.139
You must not eat from it.

00:45:59.139 --> 00:46:01.139
No, you must not touch it.

00:46:01.139 --> 00:46:05.139
Otherwise, you will die.

00:46:05.139 --> 00:46:07.139
So she understood the command

00:46:07.139 --> 00:46:10.139
and she understood the penalty.

00:46:10.139 --> 00:46:13.139
But notice in verse 4,

00:46:13.139 --> 00:46:15.139
the serpent said to the woman,

00:46:15.139 --> 00:46:19.139
you certainly will not die.

00:46:19.139 --> 00:46:21.139
Now that was a lie,

00:46:21.139 --> 00:46:25.940
but it was presented with certainty

00:46:25.940 --> 00:46:27.940
and surety,

00:46:27.940 --> 00:46:29.940
as though it were a fact.

00:46:29.940 --> 00:46:33.500
And then in verse 5,

00:46:33.500 --> 00:46:36.500
God knows that in the very day you eat from it,

00:46:36.500 --> 00:46:38.500
your eyes will be opened

00:46:38.500 --> 00:46:40.500
and you will be like God,

00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:43.500
knowing good and bad.

00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:46.500
Satan, the father of the lie,

00:46:46.500 --> 00:46:53.230
cast Jehovah in the role of a deceiver.

00:46:53.230 --> 00:46:56.230
Jesus experienced similar attacks

00:46:56.230 --> 00:46:58.230
during his earthly ministry.

00:46:58.230 --> 00:47:00.230
And the Apostle Paul was labeled

00:47:00.230 --> 00:47:04.230
by his opposers as a deceiver.

00:47:04.230 --> 00:47:08.230
So when we're confronted with negative faults,

00:47:08.230 --> 00:47:11.230
reports, we're not surprised.

00:47:11.230 --> 00:47:12.230
The question is,

00:47:12.230 --> 00:47:16.230
how will we respond?

00:47:16.230 --> 00:47:18.230
Have you ever considered some questions

00:47:18.230 --> 00:47:21.230
that Eve could have asked herself

00:47:21.230 --> 00:47:25.230
that would have helped her to make a good decision?

00:47:25.230 --> 00:47:27.230
Here's one.

00:47:27.230 --> 00:47:29.230
What do I know about the person

00:47:29.230 --> 00:47:33.230
who is the source of this negative report?

00:47:34.539 --> 00:47:36.539
What is his motive?

00:47:36.539 --> 00:47:39.539
Does he have my best interests at heart?

00:47:39.539 --> 00:47:42.539
Or does he have an agenda?

00:47:44.659 --> 00:47:46.659
And another question.

00:47:46.659 --> 00:47:49.659
Before I accept his truth,

00:47:49.659 --> 00:47:54.659
a negative report from someone I don't know,

00:47:54.659 --> 00:47:56.659
is there someone I do know,

00:47:56.659 --> 00:47:59.659
someone I trust who I can talk with

00:47:59.659 --> 00:48:02.659
and get some good advice?

00:48:02.659 --> 00:48:05.659
Well, Eve certainly could have talked with her husband,

00:48:05.659 --> 00:48:08.659
and together they could have talked with Jehovah.

00:48:08.659 --> 00:48:12.659
And if Eve had asked herself those questions,

00:48:12.659 --> 00:48:17.659
the world would likely be a much different place today.

00:48:17.659 --> 00:48:23.969
But Eve chose to believe a lie.

00:48:23.969 --> 00:48:27.570
How about the pioneer sister

00:48:27.570 --> 00:48:30.570
and the Bible student that I mentioned earlier?

00:48:30.570 --> 00:48:34.570
How did they handle the situation?

00:48:34.570 --> 00:48:36.570
Well, the pioneer sister told us

00:48:36.570 --> 00:48:41.570
that she reflected on the fact that she was a guest

00:48:41.570 --> 00:48:44.570
in the Bible student's house.

00:48:44.570 --> 00:48:46.570
And so she felt it would be rude

00:48:46.570 --> 00:48:49.570
for her to interrupt the conversation,

00:48:49.570 --> 00:48:52.570
so she chose to say nothing.

00:48:52.570 --> 00:48:56.820
What did the Bible student do?

00:48:56.820 --> 00:48:59.820
Interestingly, she asked the woman,

00:48:59.820 --> 00:49:03.820
do you know the man who wrote that book?

00:49:03.820 --> 00:49:05.820
No.

00:49:05.820 --> 00:49:08.820
Do you know his motive for writing?

00:49:08.820 --> 00:49:12.800
Why would he write such a book?

00:49:12.800 --> 00:49:14.800
Well, I know this lady who comes

00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:16.800
and studies the Bible with me,

00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:19.800
and I know her motive is good,

00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:23.800
so I don't think I need to read your book.

00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:26.800
What a beautiful response.

00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:29.800
The Bible student got it,

00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:32.800
and we get it too.

00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:36.800
We know, and we're not surprised,

00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:40.800
that we will be the target of negative reports.

00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:45.800
At times, we may even be cast in the role of deceivers.

00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:48.800
And Jehovah has frankly told us

00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:51.800
that there are some who are willing to exchange

00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:55.800
the truth of God for the lie.

00:49:55.800 --> 00:49:59.800
But that will never be true of you or me.

00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:04.800
Instead, we hold to Jehovah the God of truth.

00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:09.800
We continue to recommend ourselves as God's ministers

00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:12.800
by truthful speech.

00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:16.800
Next, let's benefit from the experience of a brother

00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:19.800
who made significant life changes

00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:24.800
when he accepted the truth only to slip back

00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:27.800
and stray from it later.

00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:31.800
Notice how Jehovah feels about those who stray

00:50:31.800 --> 00:50:48.860
and how he extends his loving arm of assistance.

00:50:48.860 --> 00:50:51.860
I grew up in the Highlands of Scotland.

00:50:51.860 --> 00:50:54.860
It was a beautiful part of the world to grow up in,

00:50:54.860 --> 00:50:56.860
but my father, when I was growing up,

00:50:56.860 --> 00:50:59.860
him and his friends, they worked very hard,

00:50:59.860 --> 00:51:01.860
but they also drank a lot.

00:51:01.860 --> 00:51:04.860
There was a lot of violence and heavy drinking,

00:51:04.860 --> 00:51:09.860
and of course, this sometimes came into home life as well.

00:51:09.860 --> 00:51:12.860
By the time I was 14, I'd started drinking,

00:51:12.860 --> 00:51:16.860
and sometimes I fought with my father and my stepfather.

00:51:16.860 --> 00:51:19.860
It affected my self-esteem and my view of myself.

00:51:19.860 --> 00:51:23.860
I often went to school feeling low and crashed,

00:51:23.860 --> 00:51:27.860
but at times, the teachers started to read the Bible to us.

00:51:27.860 --> 00:51:29.860
Those accounts touched me so deeply,

00:51:29.860 --> 00:51:33.860
and it gave me real sense of hope for the future.

00:51:33.860 --> 00:51:36.860
I didn't want to be fighting and getting into trouble.

00:51:36.860 --> 00:51:40.719
I wanted to be a better person.

00:51:40.719 --> 00:51:43.719
I had a purpose. I knew there was more to life than this,

00:51:43.719 --> 00:51:45.719
and so I joined the army.

00:51:45.719 --> 00:51:49.719
The army gave me the opportunity to get out of the environment

00:51:49.719 --> 00:51:53.719
and to see the world.

00:51:53.719 --> 00:51:56.719
Still, at the weekends, we often ended up

00:51:56.719 --> 00:52:00.349
drinking too much and being violent.

00:52:00.349 --> 00:52:03.349
When I got into trouble, I always felt deep regret.

00:52:03.349 --> 00:52:05.349
I always wanted to change,

00:52:05.349 --> 00:52:07.349
so I knew that I needed to escape from that environment

00:52:07.349 --> 00:52:11.349
and start afresh, so I decided to move to Edinburgh.

00:52:11.349 --> 00:52:15.349
I was really doing a lot of fitness training at this time,

00:52:15.349 --> 00:52:18.349
but really what I had done was I had replaced one addiction

00:52:18.349 --> 00:52:22.349
which was alcohol with another addiction which was fitness.

00:52:22.349 --> 00:52:25.349
I was smiling on the outside, but I burnt out

00:52:25.349 --> 00:52:29.349
that was in a black hole where I couldn't get out.

00:52:29.349 --> 00:52:32.349
I knew that God was the only person that could help me,

00:52:32.349 --> 00:52:34.349
and I prayed a lot during that time

00:52:34.349 --> 00:52:39.349
so that He would help me to find happiness and a purpose in life.

00:52:40.349 --> 00:52:43.349
A colleague came to work alongside me who had been in the Marines.

00:52:43.349 --> 00:52:46.349
We had gone to a nightclub and on the way home,

00:52:46.349 --> 00:52:49.349
I said that I didn't like this type of environment.

00:52:49.349 --> 00:52:54.349
And to my surprise, this colleague of mine started to talk to me about the Bible.

00:52:54.349 --> 00:52:58.349
But after two or three hours of my questions,

00:52:58.349 --> 00:53:00.349
he said, I will get my dad to speak to you.

00:53:00.349 --> 00:53:02.349
His father was one of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:53:02.349 --> 00:53:04.349
He gave me some publications,

00:53:04.349 --> 00:53:07.349
and he encouraged me to read them alongside the Bible

00:53:07.349 --> 00:53:10.349
looking up the verses in the Bible.

00:53:10.349 --> 00:53:13.349
We started to study the Bible with his father.

00:53:13.349 --> 00:53:15.349
We started to attend the meetings.

00:53:15.349 --> 00:53:18.349
About one and a half years after we'd started,

00:53:18.349 --> 00:53:23.349
both got baptized as one of Jehovah's Witnesses on the same day.

00:53:23.349 --> 00:53:25.349
A few years after I got baptized,

00:53:25.349 --> 00:53:28.349
I moved to Germany and during that time,

00:53:28.349 --> 00:53:33.349
unfortunately I was disfellowship from the Christian congregation.

00:53:33.349 --> 00:53:35.349
I went to work in the North Sea,

00:53:35.349 --> 00:53:39.349
and I was so unhappy in this environment that when I was not working,

00:53:39.349 --> 00:53:40.349
I was drinking a lot.

00:53:40.349 --> 00:53:46.349
If I was not careful, I would end up doing myself some damage to my health.

00:53:46.349 --> 00:53:48.349
So I decided to move to Italy.

00:53:48.349 --> 00:53:50.349
Often when I was out riding my bike,

00:53:50.349 --> 00:53:52.349
and every time I passed the Kingdom Hall,

00:53:52.349 --> 00:53:53.349
I would ask the question,

00:53:53.349 --> 00:53:56.349
how am I going to return to Jehovah?

00:53:56.349 --> 00:54:00.349
I thought, well, Jehovah will never want me to come back.

00:54:00.349 --> 00:54:03.349
One Saturday morning, the doorbell went,

00:54:03.349 --> 00:54:06.349
sure enough, it was two of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:54:06.349 --> 00:54:09.349
I knew that Jehovah had sent these two witnesses,

00:54:09.349 --> 00:54:12.349
and Jehovah was saying, I still love you, you know?

00:54:12.349 --> 00:54:15.349
No matter what you have done, I still love you.

00:54:15.349 --> 00:54:17.349
And so for the next few months,

00:54:17.349 --> 00:54:20.349
I spent a lot of time thinking about that,

00:54:20.349 --> 00:54:23.349
and accepting Jehovah's love.

00:54:23.349 --> 00:54:26.349
I still had some distractions in my life.

00:54:26.349 --> 00:54:28.349
I was training for a race across the Alps.

00:54:28.349 --> 00:54:32.349
I was still working on the oil platforms in the North Sea.

00:54:32.349 --> 00:54:36.349
I wasn't making spiritual progress.

00:54:36.349 --> 00:54:39.349
One time, the elders in the Kingdom Hall told me

00:54:39.349 --> 00:54:42.349
that there was no meeting during the week,

00:54:42.349 --> 00:54:45.349
but they encouraged me to go to an assembly in Rome.

00:54:45.349 --> 00:54:50.349
What really touched me the most was how clean Jehovah's people were,

00:54:50.349 --> 00:54:54.349
compared to the people that I'd been associated in for so many years.

00:54:54.349 --> 00:55:00.050
While I was driving home, I remember there was a storm.

00:55:00.050 --> 00:55:03.050
I had all these thoughts racing through my mind.

00:55:03.050 --> 00:55:05.050
How did I manage to leave the congregation?

00:55:05.050 --> 00:55:09.050
How did I manage to leave Jehovah?

00:55:09.050 --> 00:55:12.050
On that journey home, I knew that I would never go back to work

00:55:12.050 --> 00:55:15.050
on the oil platforms in the North Sea.

00:55:15.050 --> 00:55:17.050
I had a lot of free time on my hands,

00:55:17.050 --> 00:55:19.050
so I read the Bible a lot,

00:55:19.050 --> 00:55:21.050
and the publications from Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:55:21.050 --> 00:55:24.050
And there was something in those publications that touched me

00:55:24.050 --> 00:55:27.050
because it said, return to me, whole-sold.

00:55:27.050 --> 00:55:30.050
Let's set matter straight between us now.

00:55:30.050 --> 00:55:35.519
I spoke with the elders and told them of my intent

00:55:35.519 --> 00:55:40.519
to attend all the meetings and to serve Jehovah whole-sold.

00:55:40.519 --> 00:55:45.519
And after a period of time, I was reinstated in the congregation.

00:55:45.519 --> 00:55:49.519
When I tried to do things my own way,

00:55:49.519 --> 00:55:53.519
my life ended up out of balance, a mess.

00:55:53.519 --> 00:55:57.519
I was so unhappy, but with Jehovah in my life,

00:55:57.519 --> 00:56:00.519
it gave me more balance in my life.

00:56:00.519 --> 00:56:03.519
It was about learning to accept Jehovah's love.

00:56:03.519 --> 00:56:06.519
And when I did that, I started to make progress

00:56:06.519 --> 00:56:09.519
because I was able to accept Jehovah's love,

00:56:09.519 --> 00:56:12.519
but I was also able to accept the love through the brothers

00:56:12.519 --> 00:56:15.519
and the congregation.

00:56:15.519 --> 00:56:17.519
Jehovah's love is way greater than that.

00:56:17.519 --> 00:56:20.519
And Jehovah's love is able to cover everything.

00:56:20.519 --> 00:56:25.519
So I realized that Jehovah's wisdom is for me priceless

00:56:25.519 --> 00:56:28.519
because Jehovah's the only one who can turn a negative situation

00:56:28.519 --> 00:56:32.519
into something positive and give us a real sense of purpose

00:56:32.519 --> 00:56:34.519
and hoppiness in our life.

00:56:34.519 --> 00:56:41.110
Have you, like Brother McKay, straight?

00:56:41.110 --> 00:56:48.110
Have you become inactive or even been removed from the congregation?

00:56:48.110 --> 00:56:51.110
Consider the following invitation,

00:56:51.110 --> 00:56:59.110
so warmly brought to life in our new music video, Home.

00:57:00.110 --> 00:57:10.760
You can feel lost sometimes,

00:57:10.760 --> 00:57:13.760
like I'm drifting out to see

00:57:13.760 --> 00:57:18.550
when troubles in my life

00:57:18.550 --> 00:57:22.550
take me far from kingdom realities.

00:57:22.550 --> 00:57:27.550
But I'm never left in the lurch

00:57:27.550 --> 00:57:31.550
Jehovah hears and sends out the sur.

00:57:31.550 --> 00:57:35.800
He finds me,

00:57:35.800 --> 00:57:40.800
lifts me up in his arms.

00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:44.849
He can say,

00:57:44.849 --> 00:57:51.840
brings me back to his fold,

00:57:51.840 --> 00:57:54.840
my home, my family.

00:57:54.840 --> 00:57:56.840
I am never alone.

00:57:56.840 --> 00:58:10.969
When I'm home,

00:58:10.969 --> 00:58:12.969
he's like this.

00:58:12.969 --> 00:58:15.969
It's a shelter from the storm

00:58:15.969 --> 00:58:20.250
where I find peace and rest

00:58:20.250 --> 00:58:25.250
and loving friends will bring out the very best

00:58:25.250 --> 00:58:29.250
so if you find your route on your own

00:58:29.250 --> 00:58:47.139
Jehovah will hear your cries to call

00:58:47.139 --> 00:58:52.139
serving him was your best choice.

00:58:52.139 --> 00:58:57.539
Hold your home, your family.

00:58:57.539 --> 00:59:17.300
You are never alone.

00:59:17.300 --> 00:59:40.679
We're so happy to see you far

00:59:40.679 --> 01:00:22.099
lifted you up.

01:00:22.099 --> 01:00:26.099
Home is with Jehovah and his people.

01:00:26.099 --> 01:00:29.099
Home is where we belong.

01:00:29.099 --> 01:00:31.099
If you've wandered,

01:00:31.099 --> 01:00:35.250
come home.

01:00:35.250 --> 01:00:40.250
The beauty of our spiritual home extends across the entire world.

01:00:40.250 --> 01:00:43.250
Let's explore another room in that home

01:00:43.250 --> 01:00:47.250
by visiting our brothers and sisters in Suriname.

01:00:47.250 --> 01:00:52.820
Suriname is a heavily forested country in South America

01:00:52.820 --> 01:00:54.820
that's almost like an island.

01:00:54.820 --> 01:00:59.820
It is currently connected by road to any other country.

01:00:59.820 --> 01:01:01.820
On its east and west,

01:01:01.820 --> 01:01:03.820
it's bounded by rivers

01:01:03.820 --> 01:01:06.820
and on the north by the Atlantic Ocean

01:01:06.820 --> 01:01:09.820
and to the south by tropical rainforests,

01:01:09.820 --> 01:01:13.820
savannas, and the mighty Amazon River Basin.

01:01:13.820 --> 01:01:16.820
While Suriname may be one of the smallest countries

01:01:16.820 --> 01:01:18.820
in South America,

01:01:18.820 --> 01:01:23.820
it's abundant wild areas host some of the continent's largest animals.

01:01:23.820 --> 01:01:26.820
The giant ant-eater, for example,

01:01:26.820 --> 01:01:31.820
eats some 35,000 ants in termites a day.

01:01:31.820 --> 01:01:34.820
Also found in Suriname, the taper.

01:01:34.820 --> 01:01:37.820
South America's largest land mammal.

01:01:37.820 --> 01:01:41.820
And the Jaguar, the largest of South American cats.

01:01:41.820 --> 01:01:46.820
Suriname's rich diversity isn't limited to wildlife.

01:01:46.820 --> 01:01:50.820
Its people are one of the most ethnically diverse in the region.

01:01:51.820 --> 01:01:57.820
They're varying customs and foods in rich the country's overall culture.

01:01:57.820 --> 01:02:01.820
In such a heavily forested and diverse country,

01:02:01.820 --> 01:02:08.820
imagine the challenge are over 3,300 brothers face, first reaching

01:02:08.820 --> 01:02:13.820
and then reaching to people in their own languages.

01:02:13.820 --> 01:02:16.820
While the official language of Suriname is Dutch,

01:02:16.820 --> 01:02:19.820
the Suriname branch oversees translation

01:02:19.820 --> 01:02:22.820
into five other languages.

01:02:22.820 --> 01:02:25.820
Surin and Tango, Aachen,

01:02:25.820 --> 01:02:29.820
Saramakan, Suriname Sign Language, and Karab.

01:02:29.820 --> 01:02:34.820
In 2022, 20 translators in Suriname Bethel

01:02:34.820 --> 01:02:37.820
worked with 13 full-time commuters

01:02:37.820 --> 01:02:41.820
and eight remote workers to meet this need.

01:02:41.820 --> 01:02:45.820
Let's meet some of our brothers working in the various language fields.

01:02:46.820 --> 01:02:50.820
The 34 publishers in the Brownsweck congregation

01:02:50.820 --> 01:02:52.820
speak the Saramakan language,

01:02:52.820 --> 01:02:55.820
used by descendants of escaped slaves,

01:02:55.820 --> 01:02:59.820
who fled to the country's interior almost 400 years ago.

01:02:59.820 --> 01:03:03.820
The apura congregations, 18 kingdom preachers,

01:03:03.820 --> 01:03:06.820
conduct 30 Bible studies each month.

01:03:06.820 --> 01:03:09.820
Many in the area are Arawak Indians,

01:03:09.820 --> 01:03:12.820
among the original inhabitants of Suriname.

01:03:13.820 --> 01:03:17.820
Deep in Suriname's interior is the Pulugudu congregation,

01:03:17.820 --> 01:03:20.820
located near Pulugudu Falls,

01:03:20.820 --> 01:03:24.820
whose waters are notoriously difficult to navigate.

01:03:24.820 --> 01:03:28.820
Our brothers are adept at using their wooden boats

01:03:28.820 --> 01:03:32.820
to carry out the preaching work on the river roads.

01:03:32.820 --> 01:03:37.820
The 38 publishers preach in the Maroon Aachen language.

01:03:37.820 --> 01:03:40.820
The brothers and sisters of Suriname

01:03:40.820 --> 01:03:42.820
and the Brownsweck,

01:03:42.820 --> 01:03:45.820
Apura and Pulugudu congregations

01:03:45.820 --> 01:03:47.820
send you their love.

01:03:47.820 --> 01:03:50.820
From the world headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses,

01:03:50.820 --> 01:03:53.820
this is JW Broadcasting.
