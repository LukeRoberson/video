00:00:01.419 --> 00:00:21.120
The magnitude 9.0 earthquake that struck Japan on March 11th, 2011, is regarded as one of the worst earthquakes in Japan's history.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:26.120
The earthquake triggered a tsunami that devastated cities along the eastern coastline of Japan.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:34.119
One year later, published reports indicate that over 15,000 people died and over 3,000 are still missing.

00:00:34.119 --> 00:00:40.119
In cooperation with local authorities, Jehovah's Witnesses arranged to help meet the immediate needs of their fellow worshipers

00:00:40.119 --> 00:00:48.119
and other victims by establishing three main relief centers and 21 warehouses and relay stations to distribute supplies.

00:00:48.119 --> 00:00:54.119
Donations were received from fellow witnesses from around the world to support a long-term rebuilding effort.

00:00:54.119 --> 00:01:00.119
In just two months' time, 250 tons of supplies were distributed to victims.

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:15.819
We have very deafened the feelings as to how our brothers there are affected because we try to have this

00:01:15.819 --> 00:01:25.819
fellow feeling or empathy so that it may be happening in Japan, but we feel it as if it were happening in our backyard.

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:35.819
We have volunteers who have already told us they're willing to go wherever there is a need for help anywhere in the world.

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:40.819
When we first heard of the opportunity to come here, we didn't even have to think twice about it.

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:48.819
Immediately, our first thought was we would be privileged and love to come to do what we could to help our brothers and sisters.

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:55.819
Everyone makes such an effort to help each other. That's been a wonderful aspect.

00:01:55.819 --> 00:02:01.819
The world can be a small place and our brothers and sisters are everywhere, whether it's Japan or Russia or Africa.

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:09.819
We are not particularly tied into the boundaries that exist among the nations in general.

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:21.819
We view this as one globe and one brotherhood and wherever there is a need for help, then we give the assistance that's needed right there in that community.

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:29.819
First, they came and repaired the walls and then gave us all the necessary electrical appliances.

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:38.819
Our two cars were submerged in the blood as well and we could no longer use them so they supplied us with a car.

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:43.819
Ayadoy lost her mother and her grandfather during the disaster.

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:50.819
They didn't just bring the necessary aid. They really listened to my story.

00:02:50.819 --> 00:03:01.139
The relief work of Jehovah's Witnesses has a personal focus. They truly show concern for each person.

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:11.689
Residents were often surprised to see fully furnished buildings rise from the rubble in a matter of weeks.

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:18.689
Those are our brothers and sisters and that's not just a title we give each other. That's how we feel from the heart.
