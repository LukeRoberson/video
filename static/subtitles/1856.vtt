00:00:04.299 --> 00:00:09.300
Before I go to work, I'll go witnessing, I'll wake up, go to a coffee,

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.300
sit in my chair and I'll check J.A.R.I. all.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:18.420
I think it's important because it helps us to keep informed

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.420
with what our mothers are going through.

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:27.420
We not read about my brothers and sisters facing trials.

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.420
I just feel I want to do something to help these brothers and sisters.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:37.429
When Jehovah's Witnesses were banned in Russia,

00:00:37.429 --> 00:00:42.429
a lot of negative false and questionable information about us

00:00:42.429 --> 00:00:44.429
began to appear in the media.

00:00:44.429 --> 00:00:46.429
It was also unreal.

00:00:46.429 --> 00:00:48.429
It was hard to believe.

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:54.380
When the Apostle Paul was facing a trial,

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:59.380
he was asking the brothers to exert themselves in prayer to God for me.

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:05.819
For a brother's going through the jail, through natural disasters,

00:01:05.819 --> 00:01:11.819
they need all the support and the help that they can get.

00:01:11.819 --> 00:01:13.819
We're so close to the end.

00:01:13.819 --> 00:01:16.819
We want our children to understand what we might face.

00:01:16.819 --> 00:01:19.819
We've done the videos on praying for others

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:23.819
and the brothers have given us some good worksheets.

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:28.819
For family worship, we did some worksheets.

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:31.819
They might not know that we're praying for them,

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:34.819
but Jehovah feels happy when I pray for them.

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:38.819
They have courage. I don't want to be like them too.

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:42.819
As a mother, I think it's really important for our children

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:45.819
to know what's going on with others' trials.

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:49.819
And if they can stop and really feel for those brothers

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:56.609
and then offer a prayer, they're taking part in them being faithful.

00:01:56.609 --> 00:02:00.609
It's always encouraging to pray for others

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:06.609
because you're actually building your relationship with Jehovah.

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:10.610
When you stop and consider what others are going through

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.610
and how they're being faithful, that's really built my faith

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.610
and then I want to imitate their faith.

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:26.580
I was involved in a car accident and that impacted on my life.

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.020
I have been every day.

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.020
I was feeling lonely to press.

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:40.129
And while I was scrolling through the website,

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:42.129
I came across the newsroom

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:45.129
and I read about our brothers and sisters,

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:47.129
the things that they were going through,

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:49.129
the challenges they were facing.

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:53.129
If they didn't give up going through all that difficult times,

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:57.129
then I don't have to give up either.

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:01.129
My sequence of prayer now is to pray for others first

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:04.129
and then for myself last.

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:08.129
When we pray for others, it helps us to build our faith in Jehovah

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:13.129
and trust in Him because we know that He's helped our brothers and sisters

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:16.949
and He will also help us.

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:20.949
When the persecution in Russia began to grow,

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:27.949
a sense of uncertainty arose about what was happening.

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:34.259
When we saw the news on JW.org,

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:40.259
we realized that our brothers all over the world knew about the situation in Russia.

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:45.259
Although we did not hear how brothers from other countries were praying for us,

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:51.740
we knew that they were doing it and cared about us.

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:56.740
The knowledge that the brothers were praying for us really strengthened us.

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:03.189
I knew that everything was under control.

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:07.189
When you know the problems that a brother or sister is facing,

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:09.189
then our prayers are more sincere.

00:04:09.189 --> 00:04:13.759
They truly come from the heart.

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:20.759
I must use every opportunity, I must not let up to pray for my brothers and sisters.

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:27.759
When we pray and it's for His name, Jehovah answers our prayers.
