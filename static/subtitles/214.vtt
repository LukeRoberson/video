00:00:01.389 --> 00:00:08.390
An outstanding fact is recorded at Isaiah 55, 10 and 11.

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:13.390
For just as the rain and the snow pour down from heaven,

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:16.390
and do not return there until they saturate the earth,

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.390
making it produce and sprout,

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.390
giving seed to the sower and bread to the eater.

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.390
Now notice this,

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:32.390
so my word, my word that goes out of my mouth will be.

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.390
It will not return to me without results,

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.390
but it will certainly accomplish whatever is my delight.

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.390
The word of God is the statement of His purpose.

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.390
Now it can be delivered orally or in writing.

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.390
We call the Bible God's written word and rightly so.

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.390
But long before writing was invented,

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.390
Jehovah expresses purpose in words.

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.390
And God said, let there be light,

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.390
and there was light.

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.390
Through Isaiah, Jehovah's telling us that he will always accomplish his purpose.

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.390
So no matter how powerful fighters against that purpose seem to be,

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.390
they will always lose in the end.

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.390
Remembering that will help us when we're faced with a poser so seem unbeatable.

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:31.390
So I thought we might consider some Bible examples that illustrate the point.

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.390
Take the days of King Saul, for example.

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.390
Now Jehovah sent Samuel to anoint the next king of Israel,

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.390
and as recorded at 1 Samuel 161, God said to Samuel,

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.390
I will send you to Jesse, the Bethlehemite,

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.390
because I have selected from among his sons a king for myself.

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.390
Saul's replacement turned out to be David.

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.390
He was Jehovah's choice.

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.390
At some point, Saul himself understood that.

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.390
In fact, according to 1 Samuel 2317,

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.390
his son Jonathan said to David,

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.389
you will be king over Israel,

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:15.389
and my father Saul also knows that.

00:02:15.389 --> 00:02:19.389
Confirming this, on one occasion, Saul said to David,

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:23.389
I know that you will surely rule as king.

00:02:23.389 --> 00:02:24.389
It's quite of it all.

00:02:24.389 --> 00:02:26.389
Saul tried to kill David,

00:02:26.389 --> 00:02:29.389
and he had the support of a powerful army.

00:02:29.389 --> 00:02:32.389
Saul himself was apparently a very strong man.

00:02:32.389 --> 00:02:36.389
So it was God's will for David to be king,

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:39.389
and Saul knew it.

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:41.389
So we asked,

00:02:41.389 --> 00:02:44.389
I did Saul keep on fighting,

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:47.389
and whom was he fighting really?

00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:49.389
Not just David.

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:52.389
He was fighting against God.

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:56.389
Saul was setting himself up for failure.

00:02:56.389 --> 00:03:00.389
No doubt Satan was egging Saul on.

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:04.389
If Satan could cause just one of Jehovah's promises to fail.

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:06.389
But in the end,

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:08.389
the word of God prevailed.

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:13.469
David became king.

00:03:13.469 --> 00:03:16.469
Well, who would replace David when the time came?

00:03:16.469 --> 00:03:19.469
That was also Jehovah's decision to make,

00:03:19.469 --> 00:03:20.469
and he made it.

00:03:20.469 --> 00:03:23.469
According to 1 Chronicles 22, 9 and 10,

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:25.469
Jehovah told David,

00:03:25.469 --> 00:03:27.469
look, you will have a son.

00:03:27.469 --> 00:03:30.469
Solomon will be his name,

00:03:30.469 --> 00:03:33.469
and I will firmly establish the throne of his kingship

00:03:33.469 --> 00:03:36.469
over Israel forever.

00:03:36.469 --> 00:03:40.469
So Solomon would be the next king of Israel.

00:03:40.469 --> 00:03:43.469
Who could prevent that from happening?

00:03:43.469 --> 00:03:45.469
David's son, Adam and I,

00:03:45.469 --> 00:03:47.469
tried and failed.

00:03:47.469 --> 00:03:49.469
Why?

00:03:49.469 --> 00:03:51.469
As quartered at 1 Kings 215,

00:03:51.469 --> 00:03:52.469
and he later admitted,

00:03:52.469 --> 00:03:55.469
the kingship eluded me and became my brothers,

00:03:55.469 --> 00:04:00.469
for it was from Jehovah that it became his.

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:03.469
If Adam and I thought he could outmaneuver Jehovah,

00:04:03.469 --> 00:04:07.469
he was sadly mistaken.

00:04:07.469 --> 00:04:09.469
Jehovah promised the Israelites

00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:12.469
that he would give them the land of Canaan as an inheritance.

00:04:12.469 --> 00:04:15.469
The Canaanites had other ideas.

00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:17.470
They'd heard of Jehovah's powerful works in Egypt,

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.470
but they fought against him anyway.

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:21.470
They learned.

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.470
They learned at their cost,

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:28.470
but fighters against God always lose.

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.470
Now, if you were asked to name some prominent fighters

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:34.470
against God in Jesus' day,

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.470
you might think of King Herod the Great,

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:39.470
the Jewish high priest, Kaeathus,

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:43.470
and maybe the Roman governor, Pontius Pilate.

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:45.470
Let's talk about them.

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:48.470
First, Herod the Great.

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:50.470
Let's read Matthew,

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:54.470
chapter 2, verses 1 and 2.

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:58.470
Now, astrologers visit King Herod,

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.470
and they ask a strange question.

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:03.470
We read,

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:06.470
after Jesus had been born in Bethlehem of Judea,

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:08.470
in the days of Herod the King,

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:12.470
look, astrologers from the east came to Jerusalem,

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:13.470
saying,

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:17.470
where is the one born king of the Jews?

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:19.470
King of the Jews?

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:22.470
For we saw his star when we were in the east,

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:25.470
and we have come to do obeisance to him.

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:28.470
Did you notice something strange here?

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:31.470
No angel had spoken to those astrologers,

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:34.470
yet when the men saw light in heaven,

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:38.470
they concluded that it signaled the birth of the King of the Jews.

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:40.470
That's a stretch.

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:43.470
Who do you suppose put that idea in their head?

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:46.470
And who do you suppose gave them the bright idea

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:51.470
to ask the present King of Israel about his future rival?

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:54.470
That has sat in the devil written all over it, doesn't it?

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:58.470
Now, notice verses 3 and 4.

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:00.470
At hearing this,

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:02.470
King Herod was agitated,

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:04.470
and all Jerusalem with him,

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:06.470
on gathering together all the chief priests

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:08.470
and scribes of the people,

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:14.470
he inquired of them where the Christ was to be born.

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:16.470
Interesting.

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:20.470
Herod doesn't just ask where the future king of the Jews will be born.

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:24.470
He asks where the Christ will be born.

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:27.470
No, as a Jewish proselyt,

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:30.470
he is supposed to be waiting for the Christ, the Messiah.

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:32.470
Yet, now that the Messiah has come,

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:35.470
Herod wants to kill him.

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:38.470
Herod is fighting against God.

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:40.470
Does he win?

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:42.470
No.

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:44.470
Jesus escapes his clutches,

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:47.470
and a few months later, Herod himself dies.

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:51.910
Few mourn his death.

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:54.910
In Jesus' day, the Jewish high priests were appointed

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:57.910
and removed by the Romans.

00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:01.910
Now, high priest Kaphos was a skilled politician.

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:03.910
He knew how to please the Romans,

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:06.910
and because of that, he hung on to his job a lot longer

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:08.910
than many others.

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:12.910
And he had a powerful supporter, Pontius Pilate,

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:17.910
with his connections, Kaphos seemed untouchable.

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:20.910
Pilate himself was very well connected.

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:23.910
He had a good friend in high places in Rome,

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:26.910
Lucius Sajanus.

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:29.910
Now, maybe you've never heard of Sajanus before,

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:33.910
but he was probably the most powerful man in the Roman Empire.

00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:37.910
The Emperor left most of the major decisions to Sajanus.

00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:39.910
Now, he made many enemies,

00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:41.910
but they were powerless against him.

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:44.910
Until?

00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:48.910
Until the fall of 31 CE.

00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:52.910
At that time, Sajanus got on the wrong side of the Emperor

00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:55.910
and was put to death.

00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:59.910
After that, the Emperor commanded that anyone

00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:06.910
who had been friends with Sajanus was to be executed.

00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:09.910
How do you think Pilate felt?

00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:11.910
He must have been a nervous wreck.

00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:15.910
As we said, he and Sajanus had been very close.

00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:20.910
And now, a year and a half after Sajanus was executed,

00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:24.910
what do you suppose Pilate was thinking?

00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:26.910
When the Jewish rulers cried out,

00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:31.910
if you release Jesus, you are no friend of Caesar.

00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:34.909
Some scholars believe that this was a factor

00:08:34.909 --> 00:08:38.909
in Pilate's decision to order Jesus' execution

00:08:38.909 --> 00:08:41.909
to protect his own job.

00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:43.909
Did he protect it?

00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:44.909
No.

00:08:44.909 --> 00:08:46.909
Pilate wasn't immediately struck by lightning,

00:08:46.909 --> 00:08:50.909
but less than four years after he sent his Jesus to death,

00:08:50.909 --> 00:08:54.909
he got into big trouble and was recalled to Rome.

00:08:54.909 --> 00:08:56.909
With no powerful friend to defend him,

00:08:56.909 --> 00:09:00.909
Pilate was removed as Roman governor.

00:09:00.909 --> 00:09:03.909
What happened next isn't clear.

00:09:03.909 --> 00:09:05.909
Some say Pilate committed suicide.

00:09:05.909 --> 00:09:08.909
Others say he was banished.

00:09:08.909 --> 00:09:12.909
Whatever happened, it wasn't good.

00:09:12.909 --> 00:09:14.909
When Pilate lost his job,

00:09:14.909 --> 00:09:16.909
Kephas lost his protector,

00:09:16.909 --> 00:09:19.909
and soon he was removed as high priest.

00:09:19.909 --> 00:09:22.909
Thus, two fighters against God,

00:09:22.909 --> 00:09:25.909
Pilate and Kephas were dispatched

00:09:25.909 --> 00:09:28.909
soon after they committed their greatest crime.

00:09:28.909 --> 00:09:34.860
We certainly don't want to be fighters against Jehovah God.

00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:38.860
How can we cooperate with this purpose today?

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:40.860
Consider this scenario.

00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:42.860
A brother offends you.

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:45.860
Says something thoughtless.

00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:47.860
You're hurt.

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:50.860
Now, how does Jehovah view that person?

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:52.860
He's God's friend.

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:54.860
Jehovah loves his friends.

00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:56.860
He wants you to love them too.

00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:58.860
And what's God's purpose

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:01.860
for the brother who offended you?

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:04.860
He wants him to enjoy life forever.

00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:10.860
Now, how can you work along with Jehovah's purpose?

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:12.860
If you can just overlook the offense,

00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:14.860
Jehovah will appreciate that.

00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:16.860
But if you can't overlook it,

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:21.860
Jehovah would want you to approach the person in a kind, respectful way.

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:23.860
You might say something like this.

00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:25.860
Maybe I'm being too sensitive,

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:28.860
but I was hurt by what you said the other day.

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:30.860
No, I know you didn't mean to hurt me,

00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:33.860
but I thought I'd let you know how I felt.

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:35.860
If the person responds favorably

00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:37.860
and unity is restored,

00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:43.210
can you imagine how pleased Jehovah will be?

00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:48.210
In Matthew chapter 18, Jesus gave the illustration of the lost sheep.

00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:50.210
A man had a hundred sheep.

00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:52.210
One got lost.

00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:54.210
The shepherd left the 99 in the field

00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:57.210
and went to great lengths to find the sheep that had strayed

00:10:57.210 --> 00:11:00.210
and bring it back to the fold.

00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:04.210
Is it a coincidence that right after telling that story,

00:11:04.210 --> 00:11:07.210
Jesus outlined three steps we should follow

00:11:07.210 --> 00:11:10.210
when someone has sinned seriously against us?

00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:12.210
At Matthew 18, 15,

00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:16.210
Jesus tells us what our goal should be when we follow those steps.

00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:18.210
Let's read that.

00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:21.210
Moreover, if your brother commits a sin,

00:11:21.210 --> 00:11:25.210
go and reveal his fault between you and him alone.

00:11:25.210 --> 00:11:28.210
If he listens to you, notice,

00:11:28.210 --> 00:11:32.210
you have gained your brother.

00:11:32.210 --> 00:11:36.210
The brother who sinned against us may be like that lost sheep.

00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:38.210
What should be our goal?

00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:41.210
To gain our brother, not to expose him,

00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:44.210
not to get revenge, not to prove him wrong,

00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:47.210
not to shame him, but to get him back.

00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:49.210
Like that loving shepherd,

00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:51.210
we're willing to go to great lengths

00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:55.210
to bring that airing brother back to the fold.

00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:59.210
Of course, if the brother is an unrepentant sinner,

00:11:59.210 --> 00:12:02.210
the elders will follow the third step outlined by Jesus

00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:05.210
and he'll be removed from the congregation.

00:12:05.210 --> 00:12:11.000
How else can we work along with Jehovah's purpose?

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
We can do that by being involved in the preaching work.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
The Word has gone out.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
This good news of the kingdom must be preached

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
in all the inhabited earth.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000
Many have tried to prevent that from happening.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
In the early 20th century,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
a few prominent brothers opposed the organization's efforts

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
to get everyone involved in the preaching work.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
Those dignitaries were quite happy to get all dressed up

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
and give public talks to large audiences.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
But they refused to lower themselves

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
to go from house to house.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000
They were fighting against God

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
and the angels soon sifted them out.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
Most of them were never heard of again.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.309
Even in countries where there's a measure of religious freedom,

00:12:58.309 --> 00:13:00.309
fighters against God have tried to prevent us

00:13:00.309 --> 00:13:02.309
from carrying out our commission.

00:13:02.309 --> 00:13:05.309
You need a permit to go from house to house.

00:13:05.309 --> 00:13:07.309
You can't offer magazines on the street.

00:13:07.309 --> 00:13:10.309
You people are a dangerous sect.

00:13:10.309 --> 00:13:14.309
Beven enacted laws directed at stopping our work.

00:13:14.309 --> 00:13:17.309
Unless they change their ways,

00:13:17.309 --> 00:13:21.309
those lawmakers are going to be in big trouble.

00:13:22.309 --> 00:13:24.309
The word has gone out.

00:13:24.309 --> 00:13:26.309
As you go, preach.

00:13:26.309 --> 00:13:29.309
That great work will be accomplished

00:13:29.309 --> 00:13:32.309
with their support or in spite of them.

00:13:32.309 --> 00:13:35.779
Well, as we mentioned,

00:13:35.779 --> 00:13:37.779
fighters against God sometimes seem to get away

00:13:37.779 --> 00:13:39.779
with the acts of rebellion.

00:13:39.779 --> 00:13:42.779
But they're on a slippery slope.

00:13:42.779 --> 00:13:45.779
I can't express it better than David did

00:13:45.779 --> 00:13:48.779
in Psalm 37, 1 and 2.

00:13:48.779 --> 00:13:51.779
Do not be upset because of evil men

00:13:51.779 --> 00:13:54.779
or envious of wrongdoers.

00:13:54.779 --> 00:13:56.779
They will quickly weather like grass

00:13:56.779 --> 00:14:00.779
and shrivel like green new grass.

00:14:00.779 --> 00:14:03.779
So, when you hear about powerful opposers

00:14:03.779 --> 00:14:05.779
who seem to be untouchable,

00:14:05.779 --> 00:14:07.779
remember what we've discussed.

00:14:07.779 --> 00:14:10.779
These men may seem to prosper for a while,

00:14:10.779 --> 00:14:13.779
but since they're fighting against God,

00:14:13.779 --> 00:14:16.779
they're more to be pitted than to be feared.

00:14:16.779 --> 00:14:19.779
They're on the wrong side.

00:14:19.779 --> 00:14:22.779
They're fighting a losing battle.
