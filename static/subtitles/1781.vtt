00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:12.859
I played in the series A, which is the top league in Italy.

00:00:12.859 --> 00:00:22.660
I was on the national youth team and I went all the way up to the men's national team.

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:31.670
Just the fact that you are good at your job is gratifying and then there is also the financial aspect.

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:37.670
My mom and dad were Jehovah's Witnesses and so was my older brother.

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:50.560
At a certain point, I felt conflicted, especially when I decided to draw closer to the truth.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.560
There was no longer a family thing.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:59.560
In time, something started to develop in me, a fire, a small fire.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:06.560
Gradually, I came to the point of dedication to Jehovah, although I still played.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:14.560
But maybe, not maybe, definitely, I wasn't giving Jehovah my best, my energy.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:26.030
I was fitting my spiritual life around my work life and not the other way around.

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:32.030
I excuse myself saying, I'm just working, it's a profession.

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.439
Yes, it's time consuming.

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:56.689
But of short duration, because athletes retire earlier, the closer I drew to Jehovah, the stronger my inner conflicts became.

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:02.689
The circuit overseer who served the area I was associated with helped me.

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:06.969
I had known him since I was a child.

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:13.969
When we met again, the first thing he asked me was, are you happy with what you are doing?

00:02:13.969 --> 00:02:21.699
Seems like a simple question, right?

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:24.699
But this question went deeper.

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:34.379
I'm very grateful to him and his wife all the time they devoted to me.

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:42.379
They were very busy, but even on their day off, or in the evenings, after long days of activity,

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:45.379
they spent time with me.

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:49.379
In time, I moved to different cities and changed to various teams.

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:54.379
So he entrusted me, so to speak, to two other families.

00:02:54.379 --> 00:03:01.379
They poured themselves out for me, sacrificing their time.

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:05.379
Without ever making me feel bad for what I did.

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:11.379
With regards to decisions about basketball, they never told me what to do.

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:18.379
I had to reach that decision on my own, whether I should continue playing or not.

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:23.379
It was their way of life that corrected me, so to speak.

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:30.379
Their example, their lifestyle, their priorities they set.

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:35.379
And the joy they had in doing what they did, helped me.

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:42.900
It was more their example than their words.

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:51.729
It helped me understand what I really wanted from my life.

00:03:52.729 --> 00:04:01.729
I started in 1995 and continued until April 2008, when I played my last match.

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:10.319
I, let's say, made a cut and quit playing basketball.

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:12.319
I'm glad I made it.

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:15.319
Sometimes I say to myself,

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:20.319
if only it had done it earlier, if only it had had to courage earlier.

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:26.629
I had the privilege of serving as a regular pioneer for two and a half years.

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:32.910
I was asked if I would like to apply for better service.

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:40.800
And to my surprise, I was invited to the Italy branch and served there for five years.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:49.110
A few months after leaving Bethel, I had the privilege of attending the school for Kingdom Evangelises.

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.680
It was wonderful.

00:04:53.680 --> 00:05:02.680
This board, basketball, it's great, it's thrilling, it's exciting, but it's not the source of true happiness.

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.680
It's true.

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:10.680
The world can give you a measure of satisfaction, but everything comes at a cost.

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:18.009
But it took me a long time to understand this.

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:25.009
Knowing that I'm giving Jehovah my best has made me happy.

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:36.009
Yes, there is a team, a large one, and we all play for Jehovah, and its goal is beautiful, it's exciting, and its success is sure.
