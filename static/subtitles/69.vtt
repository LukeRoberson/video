00:00:01.139 --> 00:00:10.419
Welcome! This month will focus on how we can serve Jehovah with rejoicing. As

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:16.780
parents know, a child is a source of great joy as well as challenges. We'll see

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:22.859
how the good example set by these parents influenced their children. When you

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:29.140
think of God's promised new world, do images like these come to mind? How do they

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:34.579
make you feel? We are sure you'll enjoy a glimpse of the future in our new

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:41.859
music video. And we'll learn how our joy is enhanced when we express

00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:50.439
appreciation for our family, for our congregation and for Jehovah. This is the

00:00:50.439 --> 00:01:16.519
February 2020 edition of JW Broadcasting. To set this stage, we'd like to begin

00:01:16.519 --> 00:01:22.159
with a few thoughts about this subject, serve Jehovah with rejoicing. This is

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:29.079
what we're told at Psalm 100 verse 2. But do you serve Jehovah with rejoicing

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:34.879
all the time? I guess we all will agree that at times it can be difficult to be

00:01:34.879 --> 00:01:43.200
happy. So then is it really important to serve Jehovah with rejoicing? And what

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.079
does it really mean? In other words, what is this joyful attitude that Jehovah

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:54.159
expects from us? And what can we do to serve Jehovah with rejoicing and

00:01:54.159 --> 00:02:01.939
maintain a joyful spirit? How can we prove that it is important to serve

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:07.260
Jehovah with rejoicing? You might think of our goal, which is to reflect his

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:14.819
personality. In 1 Timothy 1 verse 11, he's called the happy God. So isn't it

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:22.099
logical that Jehovah expects us to be happy in his service? In Deuteronomy

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:28.060
chapter 28, we find a report of God's dealings with these relights. Here, Jehovah

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:35.280
warned them of what would take place if they became disobedient and lost their

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:42.259
joy in serving him. We read at Deuteronomy chapter 28 beginning in verse 45,

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:49.539
All these curses will certainly come upon you because you did not listen to

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:55.939
the voice of Jehovah your God by keeping his commandments and because you did

00:02:55.939 --> 00:03:02.139
not serve Jehovah your God with rejoicing and joy of heart when you had such an

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:09.259
abundance of everything. Jehovah took such good care of these relights and yet

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:16.780
they were not happy. This attitude was something he did not like at all. So we see

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:24.879
that serving Jehovah joyfully is very important. This was emphasized by what

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:30.379
Jesus taught. For example, in the sermon on the mount, he helped his audience to

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:37.219
understand how to be happy. At times, this part in Matthew chapter 5 is referred

00:03:37.219 --> 00:03:43.819
to as the nine happy-nesses. Later, the Apostle Paul wrote about the

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:50.099
fruitage of the Spirit. Joy is counted among the aspects of the fruitage of

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:58.099
the Spirit. Being joyful is important and by means of his spirit, Jehovah helps

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:06.639
us to rejoice in his service. But is it realistic to expect that we all smile

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:13.879
all the time and cheerfully sing songs the whole day? Of course, this is not

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:18.720
what Jehovah expects. We all have different personalities and express our

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:25.040
happiness differently. Also, there are moments in life when we are sad and

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:32.040
disappointed. And Jehovah is fully aware that some of us are not healthy.

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.600
Others might fight depression and are therefore at times just not able to

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:46.800
express joy in this way. And yet, he loves all of us and appreciates us very much.

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:54.199
So then, what is the joy that Jehovah expects from us? What exactly is this

00:04:54.199 --> 00:05:02.759
joyful spirit or attitude? Here in Dutronomy, the term rejoicing means the

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:09.959
inner feeling and the outward manifestation of joy. And we also read about the

00:05:09.959 --> 00:05:16.600
joy of heart. The heart stands for what we are on the inside. This is the

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:21.680
interior man and is displayed in all his various activities, desires,

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:30.160
affections, emotions, passions, thoughts, and so on. And so we see that joy

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:38.639
comes from within us. Yet, does the joy we are talking about depend on

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:46.079
circumstances? Let's illustrate. I think it's safe to say that we all like sunshine.

00:05:46.959 --> 00:05:54.079
However, how does the farmer feel when he urgently needs it to rain? And he's waiting,

00:05:54.879 --> 00:05:59.600
and waiting? He probably would be happier if he had rain.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:08.160
In these last days, we rarely, if ever, have perfect circumstances with no problems.

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:14.480
So I think we can all agree that our joy in Jehovah's service is not based on

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:22.079
circumstances. And we've had here on this program and in our publications, many examples of

00:06:22.079 --> 00:06:27.600
ones who have maintained their joy in Jehovah's service despite challenging circumstances

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:37.279
like poor health or opposition. So then what is it that makes us a happy person?

00:06:39.199 --> 00:06:43.759
To help us to open up the scope of the answer, would you be willing to join me for a little

00:06:43.759 --> 00:06:51.089
experiment? Please close your eyes for a moment. Do you have your eyes closed?

00:06:52.529 --> 00:07:01.810
So now, think about an apple. Now you can open your eyes again. Let me ask you a question.

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:13.439
Did you think about a red apple, green apple, or a yellow apple? Why are you able to answer

00:07:13.439 --> 00:07:22.959
this question? All I asked you to do was to think about an apple. The answer is we think in

00:07:22.959 --> 00:07:30.399
pictures. In fact, we think of countless pictures every day. And after we think about it,

00:07:30.399 --> 00:07:36.800
it's like we put all of the pictures in a stack. And then when we think the same thought a

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:42.480
second time, it's like we pull the picture out from below and put it on top of the stack.

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:51.040
The longer that we do not think the thought, the deeper the pictures gets in the stack and it

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:57.759
becomes more difficult to remember. Now, this stack of pictures representing our thoughts

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:07.120
is our subconscious. This stack of pictures makes up our emotional state or state of mind.

00:08:08.079 --> 00:08:16.240
It determines whether we are sad or happy, whether we are bored or excited and so forth.

00:08:19.389 --> 00:08:26.189
And Jehovah our Creator is aware of this powerful connection between our thoughts and pictures.

00:08:27.709 --> 00:08:34.990
Let's please turn to 2nd Kings chapter 6 to find one example of how Jehovah made use of this.

00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:42.190
Here, we find the report about the King of Syria who wanted to capture Elijah.

00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:50.990
How did his attendant feel? Let's see at 2nd Kings chapter 6, beginning with verse 15.

00:08:53.169 --> 00:08:58.210
When the attendant of the man of the true God rose early and went outside,

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:06.049
he saw that an army with horses and orchards was surrounding the city. At once the attendant

00:09:06.049 --> 00:09:14.370
said to him, Alas, my master, what are we to do? The attendant was in fear. He probably thought

00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:19.250
about their defenseless position and saw himself already captured by the Syrian army.

00:09:20.769 --> 00:09:28.289
Would Elijah be able to help his attendant? Verse 16. But he, Elijah said,

00:09:28.450 --> 00:09:34.690
And do not be afraid for they are more who are with us than those who are with them.

00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:42.610
In other words, Elijah said, think of something else. Think of the many that are with us.

00:09:44.049 --> 00:09:50.370
Did this work? It seems the attendant was not able to focus on these reassuring thoughts.

00:09:51.009 --> 00:09:57.730
He could not envision Jehovah rescuing them. How did Jehovah help the attendant?

00:09:58.210 --> 00:10:06.049
At 2nd Kings chapter 6, verse 17, we read, and then Elijah began to pray and say,

00:10:09.889 --> 00:10:17.090
please, that he may see. Immediately, Jehovah opened the attendant's eyes and he saw and

00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:24.450
looked, the mountainous region was full of horses and orchards of fire all around Elijah.

00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:33.090
And Jehovah helped the attendant with pictures. The horses and chariots captured his attention. His

00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:41.169
thoughts now focused on the fact that Jehovah was with them and in full control. Now in his mind,

00:10:41.169 --> 00:10:50.610
he already saw Jehovah's victory and he was not concerned anymore. He was happy. What he saw

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:58.529
influenced his thoughts and changed his state of mind. Thoughts are so powerful.

00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:05.889
And how considerate Jehovah is. Remember, in the end, Jehovah did not need any of these horses

00:11:05.889 --> 00:11:12.450
and chariots. He saved Elijah and his attendant by striking the Syrian army with blindness.

00:11:15.149 --> 00:11:20.590
When we compare the emotions of Elijah with his attendant, what made the difference?

00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:27.070
The circumstances were exactly the same. Their thoughts made the difference.

00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:35.070
Now, what does this have to do with our subject? Serve Jehovah with rejoicing?

00:11:36.509 --> 00:11:40.269
So far, we have established that Jehovah expects us to be happy, right?

00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:48.669
We have seen that our thoughts can be pictures that influence who we are and how we feel.

00:11:49.549 --> 00:11:56.110
Pictures and thoughts are closely connected. That's why the Apostle Paul at Romans 12 verse 2

00:11:56.110 --> 00:11:58.750
highlights the importance of our thoughts when he said,

00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:07.470
be transformed by making your mind over. Or at Ephesians 4 verse 23, he emphasized this by saying,

00:12:08.509 --> 00:12:14.029
and you should continue to be made new in your dominant mental attitude.

00:12:14.669 --> 00:12:21.549
Both Scriptures highlight that our thoughts are critical and have a bearing on our whole being.

00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:29.549
Additionally, the Apostle Paul knew that we can change our thinking. Please turn with me to 2nd

00:12:29.549 --> 00:12:38.190
Corinthians chapter 10 and see what he recommends that we do. Here in 2nd Corinthians 10 verse 5,

00:12:38.269 --> 00:12:45.789
he says, we are bringing every thought into captivity to make it obedient to the Christ.

00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:54.590
Isn't this exactly what we should do? We control what we think. We avoid occupying our mind with

00:12:54.590 --> 00:13:00.590
thoughts that we can our faith or thoughts that undermine our determination to serve Jehovah.

00:13:01.309 --> 00:13:08.909
Remember we said, thoughts are like pictures that stay within us. We cannot delete them

00:13:08.909 --> 00:13:18.399
and they will have an effect on how we feel. But is there something else we can do? Are you ready for

00:13:18.399 --> 00:13:28.850
a second experiment? Please close your eyes again and do not think of an apple. You can open your

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:36.450
eyes again. Were you successful in not thinking of an apple? If so, you probably have to force

00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:45.730
yourself to think of something else. We are made to think. So the key for serving Jehovah with

00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:52.210
rejoicing lies not just in avoiding negative thoughts, but also in thinking healthy thoughts.

00:13:52.850 --> 00:13:59.809
Philippians chapter 4 lists a few of them. We read in verse 8,

00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:07.570
finally brothers, whatever things are true, whatever things are of serious concern,

00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:13.570
whatever things are righteous, whatever things are chased, whatever things are lovable,

00:14:14.529 --> 00:14:20.370
whatever things are well spoken of, whatever things are virtuous and whatever things are praise

00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:27.970
worthy, continue considering or thinking about meditating on these things.

00:14:29.570 --> 00:14:35.330
By considering and meditating on these healthy subjects, we create pictures in our mind that

00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:42.929
make it easier for us to display our joy in Jehovah's service. Serving Jehovah with rejoicing

00:14:43.009 --> 00:14:50.289
really depends on us. Happiness does not depend on our circumstances. Happiness comes from doing

00:14:50.289 --> 00:14:57.809
things Jehovah's way. When we actively control our thoughts, we add more pleasant pictures. And even

00:14:57.809 --> 00:15:03.090
if, in the past, we've experienced things that make it difficult to express happiness,

00:15:04.289 --> 00:15:10.929
in time, these unpleasant pictures will be buried under thoughts like those listed in Philippians

00:15:10.929 --> 00:15:20.370
chapter 4. And gradually, our inner peace, contentment, and happiness grows and can be seen by others.

00:15:21.490 --> 00:15:28.769
Jehovah our happy God appreciates every little step in this direction because it's important to

00:15:28.769 --> 00:15:37.200
him that we serve him with rejoicing. In our first video, we'll learn another way to serve

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:45.039
Jehovah with rejoicing. You recall, Jesus said, there is more happiness in giving than there is

00:15:45.039 --> 00:15:52.159
in receiving. And isn't it true that when we give commendation, praise, and words of appreciation

00:15:52.159 --> 00:16:00.240
to others, we experience joy. In the following interviews, notice why some hesitate to express

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:07.039
appreciation. We'll see how they were helped by applying lessons they learned from the watchtower.

00:16:20.559 --> 00:16:28.320
I work as a pioneer and also as a commuter at Bethel. I find the service to be very enjoyable.

00:16:29.519 --> 00:16:35.200
However, because of my busy schedule, at times I almost forget to express my appreciation to the

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:44.559
brothers and sisters. I wanted to express my appreciation to my wife, but I found myself feeling

00:16:44.559 --> 00:16:53.039
bashful in doing so. I knew something wasn't quite natural. Generally, expressing appreciation is

00:16:53.039 --> 00:17:01.039
considered to be a virtue. But I realized that I needed some kind of stronger motivation.

00:17:04.210 --> 00:17:10.849
Although all 10 lepers must have been grateful, yet only one person returned to give things.

00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:19.230
I suddenly realized that even if I feel appreciative, I might fail to express it.

00:17:22.079 --> 00:17:29.759
Esau was an impatient man. In contrast, David thought deeply about how wonderful pure worship is.

00:17:31.839 --> 00:17:40.940
I came to realize that it is important to think deeply. One sister was visiting a very sick

00:17:41.019 --> 00:17:46.940
sister almost every day to help her with shopping and looking after her very tenderly.

00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:58.339
As I thought carefully about why she was doing so much and how she felt, I felt deep appreciation

00:17:58.339 --> 00:18:09.900
while up in me. Jehovah richly rewards us. If Jehovah desires to express his appreciation,

00:18:10.859 --> 00:18:22.000
what kind of person am I if I don't show it from the heart? Perhaps I might be thinking to myself

00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:29.599
that I deserve to be appreciated, since I am the one providing for my family, aren't I?

00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:41.900
I started thinking about how Jehovah wants to reward my wife. That made me want to interact with her

00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:49.819
with kinder words. I feel that the way I look at her and my facial expressions by changing as well.

00:18:52.269 --> 00:18:59.950
It gets easier to resolve disagreements quickly. I also feel that we are growing closer and

00:18:59.950 --> 00:19:09.230
closer as a couple. By expressing appreciation, I feel very happy. My relationship with

00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:14.269
brothers and sisters within the congregation has gotten better and the bonds of friendship between

00:19:14.269 --> 00:19:21.789
us are stronger. I realized that the reason why Jehovah encourages us to express our appreciation to

00:19:21.789 --> 00:19:46.539
others is for our happiness. That drew me even closer to Jehovah. Expressing appreciation may not

00:19:46.539 --> 00:19:53.500
come easy for some. As we saw, we may be busy with our spiritual routine. Perhaps we are shy.

00:19:54.140 --> 00:20:00.380
We may need to make a special effort to get to know our brothers better. But what's the result

00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:06.539
if we do? We draw closer to them and to Jehovah, and that makes us happy.

00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:14.619
And being part of a loving family can bring us great joy. It also comes with responsibilities

00:20:14.619 --> 00:20:22.140
as parents, as children, and as siblings. And the following dramatization will see how three

00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:30.059
siblings decide how to honor their elderly mother. And please note how vital good communication

00:20:30.059 --> 00:21:00.500
and the family is. This wasn't the first health scare with mum. And my brother and sister were

00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:34.349
always quick to help out. But this time was different. She'd be here for at least another week,

00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:56.299
then more long-term care. We just weren't prepared for that. I should have accepted more help when

00:21:56.299 --> 00:22:05.250
the friends offered. I just didn't want to be a burden. Janice understood and she was wondering

00:22:05.250 --> 00:22:12.109
how this might affect her Bethel service. Terence wished he lived closer so he could do more.

00:22:14.529 --> 00:22:21.089
We decided to pray, sleep on it, and regroup after doing some research.

00:22:51.839 --> 00:23:02.339
Share the example of Joseph at Genesis 45, where he told his father,

00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:10.740
you must dwell in the land of Goshen, where you will be near me. I will supply you with food.

00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:24.980
He didn't let a long distance get in his way of caring for Jacob. He took practical steps

00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:39.099
and made his care a priority. Janice and Terence found great articles too.

00:23:40.059 --> 00:23:56.799
Offering solutions, such as asking for periodic help, making more time to communicate with mum,

00:23:56.799 --> 00:24:22.579
or even getting a part-time nurse. We weren't prepared for her situation to change so suddenly,

00:24:22.579 --> 00:24:39.680
but Jehovah is guiding us through each new challenge. And with his help, we're honouring mum,

00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:58.369
making her care our continual priority. In this traumatisation we saw one way that a family

00:24:58.450 --> 00:25:04.849
decided to care for an aging parent. Of course, situations will differ from one family to the next.

00:25:05.730 --> 00:25:11.809
Each must make a prayerful decision based on their circumstances. If you and your family

00:25:11.809 --> 00:25:16.049
are seeking the right way to honour your elderly parents, what can help?

00:25:17.569 --> 00:25:24.450
Bible principles. And we saw in the video open and candid communication. This coupled with

00:25:24.450 --> 00:25:31.329
respect and love will help you make a good decision. Now we'll look at the joy and

00:25:31.329 --> 00:25:37.170
challenges that come with raising children. We'll travel to Alaska and the United States

00:25:37.170 --> 00:25:44.130
to visit the Bodhi family. Let's see what we can learn from the example set by the parents'

00:25:44.130 --> 00:25:54.829
Dale and Nachah. We were serving in a small town in Alberta, and then we began having children.

00:25:55.630 --> 00:26:03.069
When we moved to Craig, we had four children, and after living here, we now have nine children.

00:26:04.029 --> 00:26:11.470
You're given this trust, and so as a parent, you need to put the kingdom first. You need to set a

00:26:11.470 --> 00:26:16.750
good example. You need to be at the meetings. You need to be regular in field service.

00:26:17.390 --> 00:26:23.150
We really believed that we needed to love Jehovah first in order to be a good example,

00:26:23.150 --> 00:26:29.390
church order. They helped us see that what would make us happy were spiritual things.

00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:36.109
My parents, more in action than in words, taught us to seek first the kingdom. With nine kids,

00:26:36.670 --> 00:26:41.549
it's always going to be hectic. You have extra children. You have more excuses, perhaps.

00:26:42.109 --> 00:26:45.549
Having nine children is a challenge in a million ways.

00:26:53.099 --> 00:26:59.180
And yet, yeah, she had moments where she'd sit in her rocking chair and just look so exhausted.

00:27:00.059 --> 00:27:07.420
I remember one time when it was time to go to the meeting, but I was so exhausted, and I thought

00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:12.859
of Isaiah 40, where Jehovah says that those hoping and Jehovah will regain power.

00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:18.779
So I figured, Jehovah wants me to do it. She's going to make me strong enough to do this, so

00:27:18.779 --> 00:27:31.390
I prayed, and I got ready. It's a scramble. In Hebrews, we see the encouragement

00:27:31.390 --> 00:27:35.549
to never forsake our meeting together. My dad always spoke of that.

00:27:36.509 --> 00:27:42.829
There was a time that we had to travel in the wintertime, maybe up to two hours to get to the

00:27:42.829 --> 00:27:49.309
the meeting. You'd come back to your home late at night, you know, with all these kids that are

00:27:49.309 --> 00:27:55.309
worn out in yourself too. Seeing the importance that they placed on the meetings,

00:27:56.029 --> 00:27:59.390
I was able to see that you never take meetings for granted.

00:28:00.029 --> 00:28:08.190
My parents always instilled in us the consistency with service, just like meetings.

00:28:08.990 --> 00:28:16.910
It just was what we did. That wasn't questioned. We got up on Saturday morning and we got ourselves

00:28:16.910 --> 00:28:25.230
out the door and in service. We couldn't simply just be back seat ornament. We knew that we were

00:28:25.230 --> 00:28:32.190
there to give a witness. From an early age, we were really following the example of our parents

00:28:32.910 --> 00:28:37.789
in showing interest in people. So because of that, we enjoyed being in the ministry.

00:28:38.430 --> 00:28:44.509
It gave me a sense of purpose. I had people to go visit in service. I had to know what I was

00:28:44.509 --> 00:28:51.230
going to talk to them about and have a plan. In field service, we would often take breaks for

00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:59.230
the sake of the children and ourselves. It was important to have our children enjoy field service,

00:28:59.230 --> 00:29:07.470
not push them hard and be too rigid and so forth. I think about Proverbs 22 verse 6 and the

00:29:07.470 --> 00:29:15.470
Bindington translation where it says to give a boy the start his course requires. They did that by

00:29:15.470 --> 00:29:24.190
putting the spiritual things before the material things. Java helped us to be the best parents we

00:29:24.190 --> 00:29:31.710
could be. We failed at times but I always knew that Java was the best parent so if we could teach them

00:29:31.710 --> 00:29:39.390
to love him, then he would take over. While we as a family were successful because we did have

00:29:39.390 --> 00:29:46.430
Jehovah in our lives, all our children are doing very well in the truth and so we're very happy

00:29:46.509 --> 00:29:55.390
about that and I'm sure it makes Jehovah happy. You may not have nine children or seven or five or two

00:29:56.269 --> 00:30:02.910
but can't all parents learn a valuable lesson from the Bodys? A very important lesson was mentioned

00:30:02.910 --> 00:30:10.430
by one of the daughters. She said, our parents more in action than in words taught us to seek first

00:30:10.430 --> 00:30:15.869
the kingdom. Yes, despite the many demands of a busy household,

00:30:16.430 --> 00:30:22.750
Dele Naja put the spiritual needs of the family first. It was their example that had a wonderful

00:30:22.750 --> 00:30:29.869
influence on all of their children. Next we'll hear from Father Stephen led of the governing body.

00:30:30.750 --> 00:30:37.230
He spoke to the Bethel family about an enemy of joy and where to find the antidote to it.

00:30:38.109 --> 00:30:43.470
Now my theme is guard against every sort of greed.

00:30:44.990 --> 00:30:53.549
Jehovah lovingly gave counsel to Jeremiah's secretary, Barrett, to stop seeking great things

00:30:53.549 --> 00:30:59.549
for himself. Now what were those great things? Well, we don't know for sure. Perhaps prominence

00:31:00.430 --> 00:31:09.309
or material things are both. But what bad quality was developing in Barrett's heart that Jehovah saw

00:31:10.589 --> 00:31:21.869
greed and the insight book defines greed as inordinate or repacious desire. The dictionary says

00:31:21.869 --> 00:31:28.990
it's a selfish, excessive desire for more of something such as money than is needed. So in

00:31:28.990 --> 00:31:36.190
effect, Jehovah was telling Barrett, stop being greedy. And in extended application, Jehovah tells

00:31:36.190 --> 00:31:45.150
us the same thing. Now echoing Jehovah's counsel to Barrett is what Jesus tells us if you'll open

00:31:45.150 --> 00:31:51.309
up to Luke chapter 12. And let's read our theme scripture here, Luke 12 verse 15,

00:31:52.269 --> 00:32:00.269
similar counsel from Jesus. Luke 12 verse 15, then he, that is Jesus said to them,

00:32:01.470 --> 00:32:10.750
keep your eyes open and guard. Now notice against every sort of greed. Because even when a person

00:32:10.750 --> 00:32:19.950
has an abundance, his life does not result from the things he possesses. No, what makes it a challenge

00:32:20.029 --> 00:32:26.349
though for us to guard against every sort of greed as Jesus counsel. Well, our three great enemies.

00:32:26.990 --> 00:32:32.269
In fact, let's discuss each of these and how it makes it a challenge. Now first, our imperfect

00:32:32.269 --> 00:32:40.910
flesh. At Genesis 821, Jehovah said the inclination of the heart of man is bad from his youthful.

00:32:41.789 --> 00:32:49.470
And one form of badness is greed. This tendency toward greed becomes manifest very early. For

00:32:49.470 --> 00:32:59.950
example, as we see little toddlers grab things and hold them tightly. Mine, mine, mine. See,

00:32:59.950 --> 00:33:05.630
that greed is starting to manifest, isn't it? When people look at a little toddler, they may say,

00:33:05.630 --> 00:33:15.390
what a cute little boy. Or he has his mother's eyes, his father's nose. But they never invariably say,

00:33:16.349 --> 00:33:23.150
look at that little toddler. What an unselfish little toddler. No, it takes a lot of effort, doesn't,

00:33:23.150 --> 00:33:29.710
to teach that little one to be unselfish like Jehovah. But now what about our second great enemy,

00:33:29.710 --> 00:33:37.470
Satan? What was Satan's downfall? It was greed. He allowed greedy desire for something that

00:33:37.470 --> 00:33:45.470
belonged to Jehovah alone to develop in his heart. And what was that greed for worship? And

00:33:46.509 --> 00:33:54.109
he wants his downfall to be our downfall. He wants to ensnare us in greed. So he tries to magnify,

00:33:54.109 --> 00:34:02.269
intensify our wrong tendency to be greedy. And if you think about it, how was Satan able to

00:34:02.269 --> 00:34:10.349
entrap the perfect woman Eve? He entrapped her in greed. He got her to crave desire what

00:34:10.349 --> 00:34:18.909
belonged to God alone. See, in effect, he said to her, eating of all the trees of the garden minus

00:34:18.909 --> 00:34:27.230
one tree is not good enough. You should crave that one tree that has not been given to you.

00:34:27.230 --> 00:34:35.869
In fact, let me please illustrate how greedy Satan made Adam and Eve, how greedy they were.

00:34:36.429 --> 00:34:41.630
I'd like you to imagine that you have guests staying in your home. And you say, now, I really want

00:34:41.630 --> 00:34:47.630
you to make yourself at home while you're here. You take them into the kitchen. You open the

00:34:47.630 --> 00:34:54.829
refrigerator, all kinds of food here, the cabinets, the pantry, everything you could imagine that you

00:34:54.829 --> 00:35:02.030
would want to eat. It's yours. Help yourself. Don't even ask. But then you pull out one little

00:35:02.030 --> 00:35:09.070
drawer. And you say, now, I've set aside some items for a later occasion. Please, it's very

00:35:09.070 --> 00:35:14.349
important. Do not eat from this one drawer, but you'll find other items just like in the drawer

00:35:14.349 --> 00:35:20.190
in the pantry and the cabinets. You'll have everything you need. Now, would that be overly restrictive?

00:35:21.070 --> 00:35:25.150
Would that be an unloving arrangement with your guests? It'd be very generous, wouldn't it?

00:35:26.030 --> 00:35:29.630
And in effect, that's the arrangement you'll hold the maid without him and Eve.

00:35:29.630 --> 00:35:34.989
But now, back to the illustration, if you came into the kitchen and you found your guest eating

00:35:35.869 --> 00:35:41.150
out of that one drawer, you had not given them. You'd be very upset when you

00:35:41.789 --> 00:35:47.710
and you'd probably view it as stealing and you likely would put the thieves out of your house.

00:35:47.710 --> 00:35:53.150
So that illustrates how Jehovah felt and how Jehovah reacted. But what a protection

00:35:53.869 --> 00:36:00.429
being content with what was rightfully hers would have been to Eve. But now, what about our third

00:36:00.429 --> 00:36:10.269
great enemy? The world. We are relentlessly surrounded by Satan's world and his spirit

00:36:10.269 --> 00:36:15.550
called the Spirit of the world. We could say that Jehovah breathes Holy Spirit

00:36:16.429 --> 00:36:23.550
to influence his people to act like him and be unselfish. But Satan, in effect, exhales

00:36:24.349 --> 00:36:33.309
the stinky spirit of the world that makes people act like him in being greedy. And one way

00:36:33.309 --> 00:36:41.710
Satan's world promotes greed for material things is by the relentless advertising. See, people are

00:36:41.710 --> 00:36:47.710
constantly bombarded with advertisements. For example, here's just an example. They may bring out

00:36:48.590 --> 00:36:55.949
a shiny new car. It has about 12 coats of wax on it. They get all these spotlights shining on it.

00:36:56.590 --> 00:37:02.030
They bring in a camera from all different angles. And about this time, a scantily clothed

00:37:02.030 --> 00:37:07.389
the woman comes strolling out to that automobile. And you'll even notice it that there's soft

00:37:07.389 --> 00:37:14.349
music playing in the background. As she opens it or gets in, a crescendo is reached in the

00:37:14.349 --> 00:37:24.269
background music. You're made to feel you poor poor loser. If you don't have that car, see,

00:37:25.309 --> 00:37:28.429
they don't talk about the heavy payments. You're going to have to make how many meetings you're

00:37:28.429 --> 00:37:34.909
going to have to miss to make those payments. You poor loser. If you don't have that car. And

00:37:34.909 --> 00:37:43.389
similar advertising methods are used very often in promoting many other gadgets and material

00:37:43.389 --> 00:37:48.349
things. So obviously, we have to fight hard against the spirit of the world so that we don't allow

00:37:48.349 --> 00:37:56.269
it to nurture greed in our hearts. In fact, if we're not careful, our love for Jehovah

00:37:56.989 --> 00:38:02.670
could be squeezed out by love for money and love for material things. And if this happens,

00:38:03.230 --> 00:38:09.309
rather than conquering the world, as Jesus did, the world will have conquered us.

00:38:10.829 --> 00:38:16.110
Now, it admittedly is a great challenge to fight these three great enemies and

00:38:16.750 --> 00:38:24.030
avoid, as Jesus counseled, every sort of greed. But now think of that. Jesus indicated,

00:38:24.030 --> 00:38:29.550
not just one sort of greed, one kind of greed. Greed can take on various faces,

00:38:29.550 --> 00:38:35.070
manifestations, see, but we're to guard against all of them. What would you say is the antidote

00:38:36.030 --> 00:38:44.750
that can immunize us against the poison of greed? Well, is it not contentment, see? For example,

00:38:44.750 --> 00:38:52.269
one sort of greed, we talked about greed for material things. Well, contentment will immunize us

00:38:52.269 --> 00:39:00.750
against this terrible form of greed. We're familiar with 1 Timothy, chapter 6 and verse 8.

00:39:01.469 --> 00:39:10.429
So having food and clothing and the footnote adds shelter, we will be content with these things.

00:39:10.429 --> 00:39:15.469
So contentment really protects us. And in effect, that's what Jehovah was telling Barat. He was

00:39:15.469 --> 00:39:21.469
telling him, you have what you need. Stop storing up great things or seeking great things.

00:39:22.110 --> 00:39:27.309
Be content with what you have and do more important things. And then he gave a powerful reason

00:39:27.869 --> 00:39:35.710
while Barat should do this. Jehovah told him in Jeremiah 45-5, for I'm about to bring a calamity on

00:39:35.710 --> 00:39:44.829
all flesh. So if you get the mastery over this, I will grant you your life as a spoil. Well,

00:39:44.829 --> 00:39:50.989
the same applies to us, doesn't it? Jehovah is soon going to bring a calamity on all flesh,

00:39:51.550 --> 00:39:57.309
and so we need to be content with what we really need and seek first, the kingdom. We're just temporary

00:39:57.309 --> 00:40:03.949
residents, aren't we? That's what first Peter 117 says. Now, here's an illustration about a temporary

00:40:03.949 --> 00:40:12.110
resident. I like you to imagine we rent a venue for our regional convention. Now, you may do a few

00:40:12.110 --> 00:40:18.750
things to make the stay more comfortable in that venue. For example, you may do thorough cleaning.

00:40:19.789 --> 00:40:26.190
You might do some touch-up painting. Might repair some broken toilets or light fixtures, but

00:40:26.190 --> 00:40:32.269
you would never paint and plaster the entire stadium inside and out. You wouldn't rip up the seats

00:40:32.269 --> 00:40:38.110
and put all new seating in. You wouldn't tear out the parking lot, put in a new parking lot,

00:40:38.750 --> 00:40:43.150
because you know, you're just a temporary resident. You're going to vacate that place after the

00:40:43.150 --> 00:40:49.150
weekend. Now, unlike the illustration, we don't know exactly when we're going to vacate, but we know

00:40:49.150 --> 00:40:55.710
it's soon. So we keep it simple. We're just temporary residents. Another sort of greed, greed for

00:40:55.710 --> 00:41:02.670
prominence, but being content with how generous Jehovah has been and giving us so many privileges.

00:41:02.670 --> 00:41:08.829
We'll protect this from this greed. It would have protected Korah in Moses time. Another sort of

00:41:08.829 --> 00:41:16.909
greed is greedy sexual desire. If we're single or married, being content with what rightfully

00:41:16.909 --> 00:41:24.269
belongs to us, see what really be a protection, it would have protected David from his sin with

00:41:24.269 --> 00:41:32.829
Bashiba, or there are other sorts of greed, such as gluttony and drunkenness. But the antidote for

00:41:32.829 --> 00:41:40.670
all of these is contentment. Contentment with what is rightfully ours that Jehovah has given to us,

00:41:40.670 --> 00:41:47.949
and if we are successful in guarding against every sort of greed, then we'll be on hand to enjoy

00:41:47.949 --> 00:41:57.070
the marvelous time when Jehovah will open his hand and satisfy every proper desire of every living

00:41:57.070 --> 00:42:05.469
thing. Full-time service is a special way to serve Jehovah with a joyful heart. But what happens

00:42:05.469 --> 00:42:12.110
to your joy when you suddenly face a serious trial? Jay and Elaine Hummer, you have been through this.

00:42:12.750 --> 00:42:19.070
Thank you for being here today to share your personal experience with us. You've enjoyed

00:42:19.070 --> 00:42:24.190
full-time service for over 40 years. Many of those years in the traveling work.

00:42:24.829 --> 00:42:29.230
Yes, we've had a wonderful privilege of both pioneering and serving the traveling work for

00:42:29.230 --> 00:42:35.150
30 years now. And we really feel Jehovah is very kind to allow us to serve in this way.

00:42:35.789 --> 00:42:41.710
I remember when I first filled out my application for regular pioneering back in 1972 and I thought

00:42:42.429 --> 00:42:48.429
this was my gift to Jehovah, my sacrifice. But after the many years of the blessings and the

00:42:48.429 --> 00:42:54.510
privileges and how Jehovah helped us through some very difficult times, what I thought was my gift

00:42:54.510 --> 00:43:01.150
to Jehovah turned out to be his gift to me. This is very encouraging, thank you. Now you mentioned

00:43:01.150 --> 00:43:06.909
difficult times. Is there anything in particular you think of? One of the hardest things that we faced

00:43:06.989 --> 00:43:11.630
was about 20 years ago when we experienced seven deaths in just a six-month period.

00:43:12.750 --> 00:43:16.989
This really was difficult because five of those seven were family members.

00:43:17.630 --> 00:43:23.789
Jay's father died. My aunt Elma who brought me into the truth died and my father died. So

00:43:23.789 --> 00:43:30.510
it just seemed one layer on top of another. We can hardly imagine how you must have felt. Now after

00:43:30.510 --> 00:43:36.750
such a job-like experience, what did you do in order to regain your joy and happiness?

00:43:36.750 --> 00:43:43.150
Well, it didn't occur automatically. We kept focused, of course, on serving the friends and

00:43:43.150 --> 00:43:47.949
working with them. And that kept our thoughts from constantly circling around our losses.

00:43:47.949 --> 00:43:52.989
We also thought about the resurrection. We focused on the resurrection hope. And as we did, it became

00:43:52.989 --> 00:43:58.429
like the hell out of salvation, protecting our hearts and our thoughts from the grief that we were

00:43:58.429 --> 00:44:02.750
going through. And then, of course, we shared our hope with others. And that helped us to have

00:44:02.750 --> 00:44:09.070
more deeply engraved on our own hearts as well. Yeah. Thank you. So now, maybe learn from you what

00:44:09.070 --> 00:44:16.190
you did in practical terms. The most difficult of all was about four years after that,

00:44:16.190 --> 00:44:20.909
when our beloved nephew Christopher was killed in an auto accident at the age of 17.

00:44:22.349 --> 00:44:26.429
He and his parents had lived with us in the same house for a number of years before he went on

00:44:26.429 --> 00:44:31.150
the road. And we always looked at Christopher like the son that we would never have this side of

00:44:31.150 --> 00:44:38.590
Armageddon. So his death was particularly tragic. It was excruciating for all of our family members,

00:44:38.590 --> 00:44:44.349
especially his parents. Christopher was on his way to the kingdom hall to meet his papa and his

00:44:44.349 --> 00:44:50.190
grandmother for field service. And his car hit a patch of ice and slid into an oncoming car.

00:44:51.389 --> 00:44:58.829
He died instantly. This was so difficult on us. Our hearts were broken and our spirits were nearly

00:44:58.829 --> 00:45:04.510
crushed. It actually rendered me speechless even to bake for the groanings on uttered became

00:45:04.510 --> 00:45:12.349
very difficult. I didn't speak to Jehovah for three days, but I was listening. What do you mean by

00:45:12.349 --> 00:45:19.710
listening? I remember when we were all together as a family and my sister just happened to say that

00:45:19.710 --> 00:45:26.510
Christopher had been cremated. We were there making arrangements for the funeral. And it just hit

00:45:26.510 --> 00:45:34.349
me so hard. It was just it just hit hard enough that I fell down and I just cried. I laid

00:45:34.349 --> 00:45:40.750
there on the floor. And I thought about perhaps maybe Mary felt this way when she said, Lord,

00:45:40.750 --> 00:45:46.349
if you'd only been here, this wouldn't have happened. But as I laid there, I could hear my

00:45:46.349 --> 00:45:53.710
sister say, go get her Bible, read her her favorite scripture. And so J did. He turned to Psalm 91,

00:45:53.710 --> 00:45:59.789
a Psalm that I had already memorized. And now I began to hear Jehovah's voice.

00:45:59.789 --> 00:46:07.949
So was this listening to Jehovah at one time occurrence? No, by no means. I really had to now do my

00:46:07.949 --> 00:46:13.469
research. So I searched for every article on the resurrection. I searched for every scripture

00:46:13.469 --> 00:46:20.349
on comfort. And I meditated on the artwork, the pictures and the publication. I remember one

00:46:20.349 --> 00:46:27.150
particular scripture that really touched my heart. It was from Psalm 56 verse eight. And in

00:46:27.150 --> 00:46:33.949
there, it said, you keep track of my wandering. Do collect my tears from your skin bottle.

00:46:33.949 --> 00:46:40.269
Are they not recorded in your book? And I thought about Jehovah taking such notice of us,

00:46:40.269 --> 00:46:46.829
keeping track, watching over, even collecting every tear and recording each of them. That

00:46:47.630 --> 00:46:55.070
truly made me draw close to Jehovah. So you continued to listen to Jehovah by looking at comforting

00:46:55.070 --> 00:47:02.190
material from the publications. Was there a specific article you think of? There was an article.

00:47:02.190 --> 00:47:08.750
It was about a delicate flower that had been bent over after a rainstorm, the kind of cloud

00:47:08.750 --> 00:47:14.110
burst that would send humans and animals running for shelter. But not this flower,

00:47:14.110 --> 00:47:21.710
here it was intact, bent over, but unbroken and still rooted. I thought about us in that same

00:47:21.710 --> 00:47:28.510
way. The article said that we can no more avoid losing a loved one than this flower could

00:47:29.070 --> 00:47:34.829
uproot itself and run for cover. It had to endure it. But the article spoke a great deal about

00:47:34.829 --> 00:47:42.510
hope and about faith. Hope is our anchor and hope is our preserver of our spirituality. And faith,

00:47:42.510 --> 00:47:47.469
James chapter one, verse three, stated in there that faith when it succeeds,

00:47:48.510 --> 00:47:54.590
we're able to endure. And so that's exactly what happened. It's softened the grief. And so like

00:47:54.590 --> 00:48:00.670
this flower, we too would stand up and smile one day. And we did. I remember the first time I

00:48:00.670 --> 00:48:06.510
smiled inside. And I thought, Oh, Jehovah, you truly by a healer of hearts.

00:48:07.389 --> 00:48:13.869
So did you do something else? Now I started looking for some of the artwork in the publications.

00:48:14.510 --> 00:48:21.469
And one particular picture I found was of a shepherd who had gone into a bramble bush and rescued

00:48:21.469 --> 00:48:27.710
a lamb. He was lost. He pulled him out through him over his shoulders and held on to him. And I

00:48:27.710 --> 00:48:35.150
thought, what a safe place to be, such security. I decided to take the picture and to print it out

00:48:35.150 --> 00:48:41.309
and just enlarge it a little bit. But what I didn't see on the publication page,

00:48:41.309 --> 00:48:47.070
I saw when I enlarged it and that there were scratches on the shepherd's face. And I thought,

00:48:47.070 --> 00:48:51.949
what that shepherd had gone through to go in the bramble bush and pull them out. And then I

00:48:51.949 --> 00:48:59.469
thought about Jehovah as our great shepherd. And the links that he went to rescue us even at the

00:48:59.469 --> 00:49:06.349
cost of pain for himself. Now I was listening and drawing back close to Jehovah. So then,

00:49:07.389 --> 00:49:12.750
what did you do with these articles and the pictures? So now I decided to print them all out.

00:49:12.750 --> 00:49:20.110
The articles, the pictures and the scriptures. And I displayed them on my desk for quite some time.

00:49:20.110 --> 00:49:26.750
But I put them in a big envelope or like a file. And I thought, that was Jehovah's sympathy card to me.

00:49:27.150 --> 00:49:33.150
We knew we had to do something so I was not to be swept away by our grief. It's been said that

00:49:33.150 --> 00:49:38.590
grief is an arduous journey, but one that we cannot avoid. It's not a place where we live,

00:49:38.590 --> 00:49:44.030
but a passage as it were. And we know that even though grief never goes away, it does change over time.

00:49:44.590 --> 00:49:49.309
That's because Jehovah made our hearts to heal. And so in time, that's what we did.

00:49:49.309 --> 00:49:54.989
Yeah, you sure did. It's not about the lack of faith. It's simply the price of love. We love

00:49:55.070 --> 00:50:01.389
Christopher. And we miss him. It wasn't like we were leaving him behind. Sometimes that's how you feel

00:50:01.389 --> 00:50:05.710
when you lose a loved one. But in reality, we know that Christopher is in Jehovah's memory.

00:50:06.269 --> 00:50:10.909
And as the righteous God, Jehovah never forgets his loyal ones. Christopher was one of them.

00:50:11.550 --> 00:50:16.670
So we're confident that we're going to see him again. And that's what helps us not to be as

00:50:16.670 --> 00:50:22.349
a we're looking always in a rearview mirror, but looking ahead to the time when we will be with him

00:50:22.429 --> 00:50:28.989
in paradise. You know, Jehovah truly kept his promises and he carried us through that storm.

00:50:29.550 --> 00:50:34.989
He gathered up the pieces of our broken hearts and sealed them. And even though this happened

00:50:34.989 --> 00:50:41.869
17 years ago, sure, we still have cracks in our hearts, but we know for certainty those one day

00:50:41.869 --> 00:50:48.510
will disappear as well. And that paradise when we welcome him back home. And so Jehovah truly

00:50:48.510 --> 00:50:56.190
proved to be my stronghold, my father and my friend in a profound way. We learn that Jehovah

00:50:56.190 --> 00:51:03.789
truly does love us and care, protects us. And because he is such a good father, our joy has come

00:51:03.789 --> 00:51:09.630
back and we have had such a rich life. So in all the years we've had the privilege of serving our God,

00:51:10.190 --> 00:51:15.150
we've always found it no matter what we give Jehovah, no matter what sacrifices we make for him.

00:51:15.150 --> 00:51:20.269
He always gives us more. You can out our generous, the most generous person in the universe.

00:51:20.829 --> 00:51:25.710
And so just as he has blessed us all these many years, we're confident that he will continue

00:51:25.710 --> 00:51:31.949
to bless us as we transition to our next assignment. Thank you so much for sharing your personal

00:51:31.949 --> 00:51:38.590
experiences with us. And may Jehovah continue to be with the two of you as you now continue your

00:51:38.590 --> 00:51:44.510
full-time service as special pioneers. And may you be able to apply the principles that you are

00:51:44.590 --> 00:51:50.750
just mentioned so that Jehovah can continue to guard your hearts. Thank you.

00:51:51.949 --> 00:51:58.429
As we discussed earlier, happiness does not depend on our circumstances but on our thoughts

00:51:58.429 --> 00:52:03.949
and our outlook. And we can influence our thoughts by what we picture in our minds eye.

00:52:05.150 --> 00:52:12.030
We'll see that beautifully brought to life in our new music video entitled The New World to Come.

00:52:14.510 --> 00:52:20.750
Picture the scene up ahead on the path or what seemed to be.

00:52:21.869 --> 00:52:29.789
Children laughing at play in a world free of the fears we once faced.

00:52:31.469 --> 00:52:40.349
And taking care of this beautiful earth are a people that live by our father's words

00:52:40.349 --> 00:52:48.510
until the moon is no more. There is the peace we have been waiting for.

00:52:48.510 --> 00:53:02.429
We will feel his love under the rule of his son in the new world to come.

00:53:02.429 --> 00:53:30.929
Like a son as we see ourselves there in the new world to come.

00:53:30.929 --> 00:53:47.380
Take a moment now and think of our place by the mountains and rivers or wide open plains.

00:53:47.380 --> 00:53:57.309
It's a place to call home and not walking in through your front door.

00:53:57.309 --> 00:54:06.099
There is someone that you know holding out his own.

00:54:06.099 --> 00:55:12.829
I'll be tearful in red. Feels like forever since you've been face and never knew he sent it out.

00:55:13.550 --> 00:56:42.059
You'll probably want to listen to that song again and again or you might even want to sing it

00:56:42.059 --> 00:56:47.500
yourself. Our hope is one of the things we want to focus on.

00:56:48.860 --> 00:56:54.139
And this will have an effect on us. It will contribute to us being joyful.

00:56:54.860 --> 00:57:01.179
Let's conclude this month's program with a visit to a truly beautiful part of the earth,

00:57:01.179 --> 00:57:09.659
Martinique. This island in the eastern Caribbean measures just 50 miles or about 80 kilometers by

00:57:09.659 --> 00:57:18.699
22 miles or 35 kilometers. Yet Martinique nicknamed the island of flowers has stunning geographic

00:57:18.699 --> 00:57:27.579
diversity with beaches, forests, rivers, sugarcane plantations, and rugged mountains.

00:57:28.300 --> 00:57:34.780
The highest point is Mount Puli, infamous for causing the deadliest volcanic eruption in the 20th

00:57:34.780 --> 00:57:43.420
century. When Puli erupted in 1902, nearly 30,000 people died because they ignored the warnings.

00:57:44.300 --> 00:57:50.860
This tragedy is often discussed by our brothers in the ministry. Today, more than 4,700

00:57:50.860 --> 00:57:57.260
publishers and 62 congregations share the good news in eight languages, including French,

00:57:57.260 --> 00:58:05.500
English, French sign language, Arabic, and Creole of Martinique. They conduct more than 4,500

00:58:05.500 --> 00:58:12.380
Bible studies, nearly one per publisher. Over one million tourists visit this beautiful island

00:58:12.380 --> 00:58:17.659
every year, many by cruise ship. This presents a unique preaching opportunity.

00:58:18.699 --> 00:58:27.179
The city of Lamarain hosts 55,000 boaters annually. Here, our brothers preach sailboat to sailboat.

00:58:28.380 --> 00:58:35.019
This is the city of Latsinite, a Creole of Martinique congregation was formed here two years ago.

00:58:35.500 --> 00:58:43.900
Today, the congregation has 91 publishers and 10 regular pioneers. They preach in the countryside,

00:58:43.900 --> 00:58:51.900
the foothills, wherever people can be found. Our brothers and sisters in Latsinite Martinique

00:58:51.900 --> 00:58:58.860
sent you their warm, Christian love and greetings. From the world headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:58:58.860 --> 00:59:07.099
this is JW Broadcasting.
