00:00:02.319 --> 00:00:12.320
Two expressions in today's Watchtower comments are our heart and Jehovah's thinking.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:17.320
Now based on these key expressions, let us consider these questions.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:24.320
What is our heart? How deep should Jehovah's thoughts enter into it?

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.320
And what steps can we take to absorb God's thinking?

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:38.320
So, what is our heart? Well, in the Bible, the word heart is mentioned some 1,000 times.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:44.320
Now of that large number of occurrences, only a few verses refer to the literal heart.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.320
All other verses refer to the figurative heart.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:55.320
So, what is our figurative heart? Our inner person.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.320
Does it refer to our emotions? Yes, our emotions are part of our heart.

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:07.319
Does it refer to our thinking abilities, our mind? Yes, the mind is part of it.

00:01:07.319 --> 00:01:15.319
Does it refer to our motivations? Yes, the motivations are part of it.

00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:22.319
So, then how do these different parts all relate to one another?

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:28.319
Well, to answer, let's compare our heart with a book.

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:39.319
A book is made up of several chapters. Similarly, our heart is made up of several qualities and capabilities.

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:50.319
Now, just as all chapters together form a book, so all qualities of our inner person together form our heart.

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:56.319
Well, how many chapters, so to speak, are there in our heart? Well, numerous.

00:01:56.319 --> 00:02:11.319
They include not only our emotions, motivations and thoughts, but also our attitude, desire, disposition, goals and other aspects.

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:21.319
Just as all chapters together form the heart, how many chapters, so to speak, are there in our heart?

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:33.319
Well, our heart stands for all the qualities of the inner person that make each of us the unique individual we are.

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:39.319
Now, how deep should Jehovah starts enter into our heart?

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:44.319
Well, the Bible answers that question by means of a comparison.

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:52.319
And we find that comparison at Proverbs chapter 7, verse 1, 2, 3. Perhaps you would like to read along.

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:57.319
Proverbs 7, verse 1 and 3. We will start in verse 1.

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:03.319
My son, keep my sayings and treasure my commandments.

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:11.319
And then the last part of verse 3, write them on the tablet of your heart.

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:18.319
Now, why did Solomon use the word tablet when speaking about the heart?

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:25.319
Well, today when we hear the word tablet, what do we think of? Well, likely we think of a handheld electronic device.

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:29.319
But back in Bible times, when the Israelites heard the phrase,

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:39.319
the right my commandments upon the tablet, at must have reminded them of the two stone tablet on which Jehovah wrote the ten commandments.

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:47.319
And come to think of it, in a way those tablets were also handheld devices, but very heavy ones.

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:54.319
Now, in Exodus chapter 24, we find the first mention in the Bible of the word tablets.

00:03:54.319 --> 00:04:01.319
There, Jehovah told Moses that he would write his commandments on stone tablets.

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:11.319
And then in Exodus chapter 32 verse 16, the Bible describes the method of writing that Jehovah had used.

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:22.319
The tablets were the workmanship of God, and the writing was the writing of God and graved on the tablets.

00:04:22.319 --> 00:04:28.319
So what did the Israelites know about the method of writing that Jehovah had used?

00:04:28.319 --> 00:04:35.319
Well, they knew that God's laws were not written on the surface of the tablet with a piece of chalk.

00:04:35.319 --> 00:04:39.319
No, if that had been the case, the laws could have been easily erased.

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:43.319
They knew that God's commandments were engraved on stone tablets.

00:04:43.319 --> 00:04:52.319
They understood that the laws of God were so deeply impressed into the tablets that they had become part of the stones.

00:04:52.319 --> 00:04:58.319
They could not be washed away or erased. They were indelible.

00:04:58.319 --> 00:05:10.319
So then, why did Solomon compare the heart with a tablet to teach an important truth about the connection between Jehovah's thoughts and our heart?

00:05:11.319 --> 00:05:23.319
What is it? Just as God's laws were engraved in the tablets, so God's instructions should be engraved in our heart in our inner person.

00:05:23.319 --> 00:05:28.319
They should become a permanent part of us.

00:05:28.319 --> 00:05:35.319
So what steps can we take to ensure that our heart absorbs God's thinking?

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:42.319
Well, the Psalmist David helps us to answer that question at Psalm 19, verse 14.

00:05:42.319 --> 00:05:51.319
Now, let's read it together and note with what activity David connects the heart, Psalm 19, verse 14.

00:05:51.319 --> 00:06:02.319
Made the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be pleasing to you, O Jehovah, my rock and my Redeemer.

00:06:02.319 --> 00:06:06.319
So this Psalm connects the heart with meditation.

00:06:06.319 --> 00:06:15.319
And indeed, when we meditate on God's word, we let our heart absorb God's thinking.

00:06:15.319 --> 00:06:24.319
But we need to meditate in the proper way. What way is that? Well, think of this comparison.

00:06:24.319 --> 00:06:32.319
Studying God's word and taking time to meditate on it is a bit like making a cup of tea.

00:06:32.319 --> 00:06:45.319
A cup of tea? What is the connection? Well, to make a cup of tea, you need a cup, water and a tea bag.

00:06:46.319 --> 00:06:57.319
Now, let's compare the cup with our outer person. And let's compare the water in the cup with our inner person or our heart.

00:06:57.319 --> 00:07:06.319
Then we have the tea bag. Well, this is not just a common average tea bag. No, this bag is filled with the finest tea that can be found.

00:07:06.319 --> 00:07:14.319
The contents of the bag is not only tasty, but also nutritious. It even has health benefits.

00:07:14.319 --> 00:07:26.319
Now, let's compare this precious tea bag with a Bible passage. Now, what do we need to do first before we put the tea bag in the water?

00:07:26.319 --> 00:07:36.319
First, we need to prepare the water so that it will have the right temperature or condition to receive the tea bag.

00:07:36.319 --> 00:07:48.319
Similarly, before reading the Bible, first, we need to prepare our inner person so that it will be in the right condition to receive God's words and thoughts.

00:07:48.319 --> 00:07:59.319
We prepare our hearts, we warm the water so to speak, by praying to Jehovah, asking him to open our heart to receive his words.

00:07:59.319 --> 00:08:14.319
After that, we are ready to take the next step. We put the tea bag in the water. Likewise, after prayer, we are ready to take the next step. We start reading the Bible.

00:08:14.319 --> 00:08:26.319
Now, what will we do next with the tea bag? Well, now comes the crucial question. How long will we let the tea bag steep in the water?

00:08:26.319 --> 00:08:35.320
Well, if we are in a hurry, they may leave the tea bag for a few seconds in the water, then we move it a couple of times up and down and we pull it out.

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:53.320
The result, we end up with a weak cup of tea. Likewise, if we read the Bible hastily and we think about what we read just for a few seconds and then we hurry off to do our daily activities, but will be the result.

00:08:53.320 --> 00:09:16.320
We do not give our heart the time needed to absorb God's thoughts. But if we lead the tea bag steep much longer in the water, then we allow the water to absorb the tea, the tea becomes part of the water and we end up with a strong cup of tea.

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:33.320
Similarly, after carefully reading a Bible passage, we pause and take our time to meditate on what we read. In that way, we will give our heart the opportunity to absorb the precious truth from God's word.

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:41.320
What will be the result? Jehovah's thoughts will become an indelible part of our heart.

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:58.320
So in summary, what are the three points that we consider? First, our heart and compasses all the qualities of the inner person that makes each of us the unique individual we are.

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:07.320
Second, Jehovah's thoughts should enter so deep into our heart that they become a permanent part of it.

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:18.320
And third, to absorb Jehovah's thoughts in our heart, we need to meditate calmly on what we read in God's word.

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:27.320
When it comes to meditation, what is our goal? We want to be a strong cup of tea.
