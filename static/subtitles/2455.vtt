00:00:01.169 --> 00:00:06.849
And we said earlier that it sounds like we'll be talking about marriage.

00:00:06.849 --> 00:00:11.189
And so if you look at verse 6, you see our days text, what God has joked together, let

00:00:11.189 --> 00:00:13.369
no man put apart.

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:18.010
But actually, if you look at verse 3, you'll see the topic was divorce.

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:22.329
And Jesus used our days text to set the Pharisees straight on the matter of divorce.

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:27.850
But then in verse 9, he said, I say to you that whoever divorces his wife, except on

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:33.850
the grounds of sexual immorality, and Mary's another, commits adultery.

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:39.369
So since the topic is marriage and divorce, can our single brothers and sisters just tune

00:00:39.369 --> 00:00:41.530
out of our discussion?

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:51.130
No, sometimes the man who puts apart the yoke that God put together proves to be a single

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:52.130
person.

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:57.409
And so look at the first sentence in our watchtower comments, it says, whether single or

00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:02.450
married, all of us need to bear in mind Jesus' words.

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:07.409
Well, does coveting another's mate happen in the Christian congregation?

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.409
Yes.

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:10.450
How does it happen?

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.409
Well, if you look at the third sentence in our watchtower comments for today, it says,

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:18.969
if any Christian begins to entertain, that's how it happens.

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:25.569
Begins to entertain such a covetous desire, says he should, he or she should quickly route

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:30.530
it out, the unclean desire, even at the cost of great emotional pain because, and here

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.290
again, how does it happen?

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:37.409
Having allowed such selfish cravings to develop.

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:43.010
What the point described in our sentence here, the other person, likely does not even realize

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:47.549
that this person has covetous desire for them.

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.829
The desire is just beginning to be an entertain, and you notice a sentence did not say that

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:58.670
he and she should route it out, it says he or she should act quickly.

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.750
So it was a lone individual at this point.

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.790
Well, how does this covetous desire begin?

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.110
In the world, it could be at the first sighting of an attractive person, they instantly have

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.590
a desire for more.

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.189
But we have been groomed by Jehovah's word.

00:02:14.189 --> 00:02:17.189
We have a high regard for morality.

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:22.069
So in the congregation, or even here at Bethel, the desire may develop not solely based

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:26.990
on looks, but on emotional attachment.

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:33.710
Usually the breaking of the yoke of marriage occurs when a third party is spending a considerable

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:38.550
amount of time with one of the mates, and we might mention that this is not necessarily

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.710
with malicious intent.

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:46.949
I just want scenario, a single pioneer brother and a married pioneer sister.

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:52.189
Well, obviously, they're going to be spending more time together than if either one of them

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:54.750
was not pioneering.

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.949
And periodically, they'll be in the same car group.

00:02:57.949 --> 00:03:03.030
Over time, they get to know one another more.

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.909
And this is just circumstances.

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:10.349
But this can lead up to that third sentence in our comments where one of them, usually

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:17.629
unbeknownst to the other one, has began to entertain this covetous desire.

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:22.150
He needs to route that out quickly, otherwise there is a whole series of sad events that

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:29.150
could be launched that potentially could end up with the married sister divorced.

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:35.069
Well, this same progression can happen here at Bethel too, if a brother and sister work

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:38.469
together day after day.

00:03:38.469 --> 00:03:41.949
Open please to Colossians 3.5 now.

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:46.870
Our watch star comment said, route out the desire, Colossians says dead in the desire.

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:52.189
But notice what happens if we do not quickly route out the desire.

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:54.509
Colossians 3.5.

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:59.870
It says dead in, therefore your body members that are on the earth is respects one sexual

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:06.349
immorality to uncleanness, uncontrolled sexual passion, hurtful desire, and greediness.

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:08.229
It says all of which is idolatry.

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:13.270
Well, the five inappropriate steps listed there seem to be in the order of gravity with

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:16.670
the most serious being first.

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:19.589
Look at the fifth one, greediness.

00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:23.910
Now our previous edition used the word covetousness there.

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:28.949
But really the fundamental issue is greed.

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:35.470
Look one step back, hurtful or we could say covetous desire.

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:41.389
Well if we do not route it out immediately at the start of that stage what develops further.

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:46.720
Another step back, it says uncontrolled sexual passion.

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:52.160
And if we do not dead at that point go one step back, uncleanness.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.959
You see now something physical has occurred between the two already.

00:04:55.959 --> 00:04:58.720
Not fornication but uncleanness.

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:04.560
And if we do not check it at that point the most serious will occur.

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.480
Sexual immorality with the potential of breaking the one flesh bond.

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:15.079
Well, we want our brothers and sisters to continue to pioneer together single and married.

00:05:15.079 --> 00:05:21.000
And it's impossible to adjust the circumstances of Bethel so that a brother and sister never

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.160
work together.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:31.000
So how can we all protect ourselves from allowing this wrong desire to develop?

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.720
Please turn to Job 31.

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:37.959
Now we've considered these series of verses before but it's so pertinent to this discussion.

00:05:37.959 --> 00:05:42.120
Let's be reminded of it, Job 31.

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:47.879
We call Job the integrity keeper rightly so but he was an imperfect integrity keeper.

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:53.959
He evidently had some thoughts and desires that troubled him.

00:05:53.959 --> 00:05:59.680
Well what did he do to quickly route out that desire not allowed to develop further?

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.399
Job 31, one is our familiar one.

00:06:02.399 --> 00:06:06.879
I have made a covenant with my eye so how could I show my show improper attention to a

00:06:06.879 --> 00:06:07.879
virgin?

00:06:08.439 --> 00:06:10.199
Well what's your place there?

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:18.519
But why would Job be moved to make a contract not to look at a woman with improper desire?

00:06:18.519 --> 00:06:21.920
He must have been aware of some temptations within himself.

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:27.319
And so he took this strong measure to avoid it developing further.

00:06:27.319 --> 00:06:31.319
Well if we start to entertain a wrong desire what should we do?

00:06:31.319 --> 00:06:36.399
And I might mention this works for those who've had a problem with pornography.

00:06:36.399 --> 00:06:41.399
Try not type up a contract with your eyes, sign it, and date it.

00:06:41.399 --> 00:06:45.480
Put it in your wallet or next to the computer and review it periodically.

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:50.480
And then if you succumb to the desire again, save that contract but type up another one,

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:52.480
sign it and date it.

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:58.160
You see in time we can compare the duration between the contract dates and we can want

00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:59.160
it to our progress.

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:04.439
Well hurtful desire leads to more and more depravity and that's the series of verses

00:07:04.439 --> 00:07:05.439
here in 31.

00:07:05.439 --> 00:07:06.439
Look at verse 3.

00:07:06.439 --> 00:07:09.199
Did Job realize this series of events?

00:07:09.199 --> 00:07:10.199
3.

00:07:10.199 --> 00:07:14.720
Does not disaster await the wrongdoer and calamity of those doing what is harmful?

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:17.639
Verse 4 he knew he could not hide anything from Jehovah.

00:07:17.639 --> 00:07:18.639
Six is powerful.

00:07:18.639 --> 00:07:20.319
He realized this is an issue of integrity.

00:07:20.319 --> 00:07:25.439
Let God weigh me in accurate scales than he will recognize my integrity.

00:07:25.439 --> 00:07:28.319
Wrong desire is that serious.

00:07:28.319 --> 00:07:33.319
He also realized that looking at entices the heart in a wrong direction in verse 7.

00:07:33.319 --> 00:07:39.279
If my footsteps deviate from the way where my heart has followed after my eyes, and

00:07:39.279 --> 00:07:43.959
in verse 9 you see on the same subject as verse 1.

00:07:43.959 --> 00:07:50.000
If my heart has been enticed by a woman, and what would be the consequences of this progression

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.399
of events?

00:07:52.399 --> 00:07:55.120
As judicial case.

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:56.639
Look at verse 11.

00:07:56.639 --> 00:08:03.279
For that would be shameful conduct and an error deserving punishment by the judges.

00:08:03.279 --> 00:08:10.629
So in summary, what God has joked together, let no man put apart.
