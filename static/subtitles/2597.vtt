00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:09.580
We were all excited with the announcement of the new school that replaced the school for single brothers and the one for Christian couples.

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:15.580
It is the school for Kingdom of Angelizers with an all-new curriculum.

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:24.579
We're pleased to inform you that the first two classes in the United States have completed and the students have received their assignments.

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:29.579
One of the classes was held in a beautiful new facility in Palm Coast, Florida.

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:34.579
This is a beautifully refurbished facility for theocratic education.

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:42.579
We're pleased to provide you with a look at the property and the work that was accomplished to make it ready for the first class.

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:46.579
You'll also hear from some of the students and instructors.

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:50.579
Please enjoy this informational video.

00:00:50.579 --> 00:01:01.719
After praying and praying that I could be involved at 72 years old, this facility came to me.

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:10.719
This is the closest thing I'm ever going to get to working at Bethel, but as far as I'm concerned, it's everything I've wanted to do my whole life.

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:17.670
The new property was used as a training facility by the previous owner.

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:26.670
Situated on 13 acres, it consists of nine classrooms, 200 guest rooms, and a kitchen and dining room.

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:36.670
Although acquired an excellent condition and partially furnished, the new campus still required extensive renovations before the first students arrived on September 4th.

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.670
And the support was overwhelming.

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:46.670
At times it's hard to get them to go home for the night. They just want to stay and continue to work because they see the amount of work that needs to be done.

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:52.670
And we had a very tight timeframe. The work that was necessary was extensive cleaning.

00:01:52.670 --> 00:02:04.670
There was painting work to be done, electrical work to be done, HVAC work to be done, plumbing, and then extensive landscaping was also done.

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.669
And it just made the whole area absolutely gorgeous.

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:13.669
Although many of our brothers put in many hours, others contributed financially.

00:02:13.669 --> 00:02:18.669
Whatever the circumstances, everyone put in a wholehearted effort.

00:02:18.669 --> 00:02:26.669
We have a brother and he's an older brother. He showed up one day, a little later than he normally would.

00:02:26.669 --> 00:02:32.669
And he apologized. He said he had just come from a treatment, a medical treatment.

00:02:32.669 --> 00:02:38.669
And he said that prior to this project, he could hardly get out of the bed.

00:02:39.669 --> 00:02:45.669
But every day, he's feeling better and better because he's able to work on site here.

00:02:45.669 --> 00:02:50.669
There was a time just a matter of a few weeks ago when they said that I wasn't going to live.

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:56.669
I have a cancer and I should have a number of cancers.

00:02:56.669 --> 00:03:02.669
And I actually felt like I wasn't going to be able to do anything anymore.

00:03:02.669 --> 00:03:09.669
And Joe was arranged. And they're letting me be an assistant overseer here for the outside ground school.

00:03:09.669 --> 00:03:14.669
And I'll do that as long as I'm able to do it.

00:03:14.669 --> 00:03:24.180
During the 2015 service year, 14 classes of the School for Kingdom Evangelizers have been scheduled at the Palm Coast Facility.

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:29.180
With rooming on site, the students can now spend more time on studying.

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:34.180
This place is perfect for education because it's a campus environment.

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:41.180
Some of our brothers would have to travel as much as an hour to be able to be accommodated in some of the homes and the brothers and sisters.

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.180
So it gives them more time for study.

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.180
It is a quieter atmosphere for study.

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.180
We're talking about the impact of schools like this on a congregation at Need Help.

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:58.180
We've had a number of reports from the previous schools about where individuals were assigned to a congregation.

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.180
The reports have been phenomenal.

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.180
The students say the congregations open their arms and welcome them.

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.180
And the congregations say this is the best thing that Joe would have done for us.

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.180
While the school is a blessing for both students and congregations,

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:20.180
it has been especially appreciated by the single sisters that now have an additional opportunity to expand their ministry.

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.180
Sister Tong is one of them.

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:32.180
I'm just like everyone else who just wants a certain job with everything I have.

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.180
When the announcement was made, I was so excited.

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:43.180
And I made it my goal to submit my application and get my life ready.

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.180
I had to get my finances together.

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:51.180
I had to see if I was able to quit my job and be okay.

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:55.180
My brother had just found out he had cancer.

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.180
I staged three cancer.

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:07.180
So I had to see whether or not I could leave the family and that they would be okay with it.

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:11.180
By looking at how Jehovah has guided the students to be able to attend the school,

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:17.180
we can be confident that this new facility will be used to the full.

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:21.180
Sometimes our challenge was not enough time.

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:28.180
We'll have to crunch a schedule and getting the right people at the right job at the correct time too.

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:33.180
But it seems like every time it worked out the best way it could have worked out.

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:36.180
Jehovah Spirit guided us to make good decisions.

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:40.180
We can see directly that Jehovah has said this is where I want you to go.

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:46.180
I believe that the day that I arrived, the carpet had not even been laid yet.

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:54.180
But the next morning everything was done and the sofas were on top of the carpets as if nothing had happened the night before.

00:05:54.180 --> 00:06:01.180
And I brought to my mind how amazing Jehovah is people, how hardworking they are.

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:06.180
There was perhaps maybe the time frame of a month and a half.

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:13.180
And I thought to myself, how would it be possible to get this facility ready

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:17.180
to make it an educational center.

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:25.180
When I came to this place and I saw hundreds of brothers and sisters who were here volunteering.

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:53.379
And I thought to myself the only way, the only way, the only way it could be done was through the Spirit of God.

00:06:53.379 --> 00:07:01.379
As we have seen time and time again, with Jehovah Spirit and willing workers, much can be accomplished to Jehovah's praise.

00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:08.379
We look forward to the dedication of this fully refurbished educational facility in the not too distant future.
