00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:08.939
Isaiah 4026 is a wonderful recommendation on how we can appreciate creation even more.

00:00:08.939 --> 00:00:14.820
And when we lift up our eyes and see Jehovah's creation, it does build within us an appreciation

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:21.760
for Jehovah and it builds our faith and we draw closer to him as a result.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.859
But today I would like to talk about lifting up our eyes.

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:27.440
That's what Isaiah 4026 is.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:39.399
Lifting up our eyes to recognize Jehovah's sovereignty in our life each day and sometimes

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:43.240
it's each moment of the day.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:48.960
Now when preparing this information on the subject of sovereignty I couldn't help but think

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:56.320
about the Caleb and Sophia video, it's entitled Make Jehovah Happy.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:03.439
Perhaps you remember it depicted in the video was Caleb facing a temptation in his life

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:08.359
and remember what he did when he was tempted he looked up.

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:15.079
He looked up in full recognition of Jehovah's sovereignty and when Caleb looked up what

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:16.480
did he see?

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:25.120
Well he saw in his mind's eye, myriads of angels, sharing him on to do what is right

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.439
in Jehovah's eyes.

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:34.719
They were urging him to stand up for Jehovah's sovereignty, make Jehovah's heart glad.

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:41.959
Caleb did what was right and what was the reaction of those heavenly spirit creatures observing

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:45.560
him in this temptation?

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:52.799
Well the angels rejoiced because Caleb stood up for Jehovah's sovereignty and most importantly

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:59.239
he made Jehovah's heart glad so that Jehovah could give a reply to the one that taunts

00:01:59.239 --> 00:02:00.879
him.

00:02:00.879 --> 00:02:06.920
Now that was an animated depiction but and it's cute but the point is very clear and

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:13.000
that is basically this is the scenario that we face each day of our life, sometimes each

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.680
moment of our life as we serve Jehovah.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.039
Who do we want to rule us?

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:20.280
Who do we want to be our sovereign?

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.280
Who are we going to make rejoice?

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:29.319
Whenever we watch television, when we surf the internet, when we decide what to wear, what

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:35.280
movie to watch, how to dress, groom ourselves, how much we're going to drink, whether we

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:42.840
won't drink, well will we look up, will we lift up our eyes, will we recognize Jehovah's

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:52.319
sovereignty in our life or will we look down and perhaps only see ourselves?

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:59.680
In every aspect of life we have to look up, we have to prove by our choices and our decisions

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.960
that we want Jehovah to be our ruler, we want Jehovah to be our sovereign.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:12.080
Now I'd like to briefly discuss two Bible examples that illustrate the blessings of

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:18.479
looking up, recognizing Jehovah's sovereignty and the disastrous consequences that result

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:23.199
when we look down and perhaps only see ourselves.

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:26.479
These are familiar examples but they make our point.

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:30.319
The first example is that of David and his encounter with Vashiba.

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:32.000
Now we're familiar with that.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:40.560
It's recorded in 2 Samuel 11, we might turn our Bibles there, 2 Samuel 11.

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:47.439
Now you might remember in verse number 1, it speaks of David's men going to war, fighting

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:52.199
the Ammonites but David stayed back, he stayed home.

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:59.680
The 1967 watchtower suggests that possibly he was home, taking it easy.

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:05.039
Well could this have been an indication that David was beginning to look down?

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:07.560
Well in verse 2 he really looks down.

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:14.599
It says, one evening, David got up from his bed and walked around on the rooftop of the

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:16.519
King's house.

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:26.350
From the rooftop he saw a woman bathing and the woman was very beautiful.

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:32.470
As David was looking down he was becoming more and more absorbed with himself and his

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.509
own desires.

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:37.910
David was beginning to choose another sovereign.

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:43.149
Well note what happens as he keeps looking down.

00:04:43.149 --> 00:04:49.670
Verse 3 says, David sent someone to inquire about the woman.

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:52.670
They mentioned that this is Vashiba.

00:04:52.670 --> 00:05:00.829
Verse 4 then says, David sent messengers to bring her so she came into him and he lay down

00:05:00.829 --> 00:05:02.350
with her.

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:03.709
Well we know the rest of the story.

00:05:03.709 --> 00:05:09.310
The adultery eventually leads to the death of Vashiba's husband, Yeraya.

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:15.949
So David was looking down.

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:21.629
David had trouble in his life or in his house for the rest of his life.

00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:27.230
These are the disastrous consequences when we look down, when we choose another sovereign

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:29.389
in our life.

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:34.029
We'll contrast that with the example of Joseph in Genesis chapter 39.

00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:36.230
We might look there.

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:41.389
When Joseph was faced with temptation to commit adultery, Joseph looked up.

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:47.589
He lifted up his eyes in full recognition of Jehovah's sovereignty in his life.

00:05:47.589 --> 00:05:52.319
Genesis 39, the account it says in verse 7.

00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:59.519
Now after these things, the wife of his master began to cast her eyes on Joseph and say,

00:05:59.519 --> 00:06:01.839
lie down with me.

00:06:01.839 --> 00:06:05.600
So he refused and said to his master's wife.

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:12.800
Now as we read Joseph's response, you can almost see in your mind Joseph lifting up his

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:16.639
eyes in recognition of Jehovah's sovereignty.

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:19.079
Verse 8 continues,

00:06:19.079 --> 00:06:23.360
Hear my master does not know what is with me in the house.

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.519
And he has entrusted everything he has into my care.

00:06:27.519 --> 00:06:32.199
There is no one greater in this house than I am, and he is not withheld for me anything

00:06:32.199 --> 00:06:37.040
at all except you, because you are his wife.

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:44.560
So how could I commit this great badness and actually sin against potterfer?

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:47.600
No, that's looking down.

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:51.800
He was concerned about sinning against Jehovah.

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:55.560
What a beautiful example of looking up.

00:06:55.560 --> 00:07:00.519
He looked up Joseph chose Jehovah as his sovereign.

00:07:00.519 --> 00:07:02.279
So what's the lesson?

00:07:02.279 --> 00:07:07.639
The lesson is our decisions in life and our reactions to temptations and pressures are

00:07:07.639 --> 00:07:08.879
bigger than we are.

00:07:08.879 --> 00:07:11.079
Well, what does that mean?

00:07:11.079 --> 00:07:13.560
That means that there's a lot at stake.

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:19.040
It means that what we do, where we go, what we wear, how we speak and act, what we drink,

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:24.959
how much we drink, all of these things reflect not just on ourselves, but on the God that

00:07:24.959 --> 00:07:26.800
we serve.

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:34.279
Even how we feel about ourselves, Satan says that we are worthless, we are unforgivable,

00:07:34.279 --> 00:07:39.720
but when we look up and we see Jehovah's sovereignty, we begin to see ourselves as Jehovah sees

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:40.920
us.

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:42.519
We see his mercy.

00:07:42.519 --> 00:07:45.920
We see that we have worth in his eyes.

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:51.279
Everything we do, everything we think is a reflection of our attitude toward Jehovah's

00:07:51.279 --> 00:07:52.839
sovereignty.

00:07:52.839 --> 00:07:55.959
So it's a wonderful privilege to support Jehovah's sovereignty.

00:07:55.959 --> 00:08:00.680
There's a beautiful comment in the inside book under sovereignty that really captures

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:03.920
what our attitude, what we want our attitude to be.

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:12.199
It says, the kind of persons Jehovah desires in his universe are persons who serve him because

00:08:12.199 --> 00:08:16.319
of love for him and for his fine qualities.

00:08:16.319 --> 00:08:19.319
They must love Jehovah's sovereignty.

00:08:19.319 --> 00:08:23.680
They must desire it and prefer it over any other.

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:30.079
They must be persons that even if it were possible for them to become independent, would

00:08:30.079 --> 00:08:38.080
choose his sovereignty because they know that his rulership is far wiser, more righteous

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:42.000
and better than any other.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.879
So yes, we feel that there is no better ruler, there's no better sovereign than Jehovah.

00:08:47.879 --> 00:08:55.120
And even if we could become independent, we choose Jehovah as our sovereign because

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:59.440
we know that Jehovah's way is best.

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:02.639
So remember the big issue is not what we want.

00:09:02.639 --> 00:09:05.039
It's about Jehovah's sovereignty.

00:09:05.039 --> 00:09:11.440
It's about doing what pleases Jehovah, conforming to the way Jehovah wants us to be.

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:17.779
So in every aspect of our life, let us always look up in full recognition of Jehovah's

00:09:17.779 --> 00:09:19.419
sovereignty in our life.
