00:00:02.189 --> 00:00:08.189
We already had our first born, Renita, and then I was told that we were going to have twins.

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.189
We were new in the truth and inexperienced.

00:00:11.189 --> 00:00:16.190
So I was saying to myself, how could I take care of my children?

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.190
Not only physically, but more so spiritually.

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:24.190
I would be able to teach them to love Jehovah, to worship Jehovah.

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:35.189
And first Corinthians 310 shows us the importance of raising a family by using good quality materials.

00:00:35.189 --> 00:00:39.189
So having a spiritual root in is very important for the children.

00:00:39.189 --> 00:00:44.189
My wife and I would have to lay a good spiritual foundation.

00:00:44.189 --> 00:00:48.189
We would have to set a good example for our children.

00:00:48.189 --> 00:00:55.189
As long as I could remember, I would always see my parents studying doing personal Bible study.

00:00:55.189 --> 00:01:00.189
I remember Dad one time he came to us in the living room and he said,

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:04.189
you know, I was reading Psalm 1 verse 2 where it said,

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:09.189
we should find delight in the love of Jehovah and read in an undertone day and night.

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:12.189
He said, what if we do this as a family project?

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:17.189
Like we read the Bible every day out loud together.

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.189
And my parents were very simple.

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:23.189
You know, they didn't really require a lot of fancy things.

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.189
They were content.

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:29.189
Mom and Dad always worked part-time, Dad pioneered.

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.189
So money was limited.

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:37.189
Sometimes the car we had wasn't the most reliable and it would break down right before the meeting.

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:39.189
I remember when our car broke down.

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:43.189
Initially I thought, oh, we're not going to go to the meeting.

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:47.189
Mom and Dad would say, well, the car broke down. There's a meeting tonight.

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.189
So let's walk.

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:51.189
So there's the five of us.

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:53.189
My dad and his suit.

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.189
The four women will be with our dresses, our book bags.

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:04.189
And so that taught me not to let obstacles, anxieties prevent me from going to my meetings.

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:08.189
Spending quality time was very important to my parents.

00:02:08.189 --> 00:02:12.189
And especially after the meetings, we would change into our pajamas.

00:02:12.189 --> 00:02:19.189
Grab a snack, go to the living room and just start talking about how our day went, how the meeting went.

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:28.669
Just those special moments, it brought us closer together.

00:02:28.669 --> 00:02:37.669
I saw that Dad, no matter how busy he was, he would drop what he was doing and look at me and talk.

00:02:37.669 --> 00:02:42.669
I knew I was more important to him than what he was doing.

00:02:42.669 --> 00:02:45.669
I remember a time when I had a crush on a boy.

00:02:45.669 --> 00:02:47.669
My parents reasoned with me.

00:02:47.669 --> 00:02:52.669
I felt very comfortable, you know, after that point to maybe talk about other things.

00:02:52.669 --> 00:02:57.669
Because I could see that my parents were not going to be angry at me.

00:02:57.669 --> 00:03:01.669
You know, they're going to listen to me and what I was feeling.

00:03:01.669 --> 00:03:10.669
One of the blessings that Mom and Dad gave me was teaching me how to think and meditate on scriptures.

00:03:10.669 --> 00:03:17.669
They encouraged us to sit full-time service or pioneering as a goal.

00:03:17.669 --> 00:03:26.669
We all worked part-time in my siblings and I remember one close family friend said to me,

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:30.669
you know, your parents are getting older, you know, you're their daughter.

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:33.669
And you should probably work full-time.

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:36.669
That way they have more of an easy life.

00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:41.669
After the sister's conversation, I almost gave up on pioneering.

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:46.669
But I knew deep down that my parents would not be happy about that.

00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:51.669
They wanted us to spend our youth in serving Jehovah.

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:57.669
My husband and I were invited to attend the 145th Class of Gilead.

00:03:57.669 --> 00:04:00.669
And that was like a dream come true.

00:04:00.669 --> 00:04:06.669
I have to thank my parents for that because they always supported me through the years.

00:04:06.669 --> 00:04:09.669
I couldn't have done it without them.

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:12.669
And for that, I'll be forever grateful.

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:18.670
I really do think my parents are the upbringing that they gave me.

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:20.670
I have a very happy life.

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:25.670
I'm thankful that I was able to avoid a lot of heartache.

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:31.670
And that's because my parents raised me in the truth in Jehovah's way.

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:34.670
Children are born invitators.

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:38.670
And they're going to imitate our example.

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:43.670
I want to thank Jehovah for what our family is now.

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:47.670
To see all of us in the Pioneer work.

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:50.670
Or five of us are pioneering.

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:52.670
Thank you, Jehovah.
