00:00:01.899 --> 00:00:19.390
In the first century, the Apostle Paul received division in which he was invited to step over into Macedonia.

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:31.390
Paul and his traveling companions eagerly accepted the invitation and they enjoyed Jehovah's rich blessing as evidenced in the positive results they experienced in their ministry.

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:40.390
Today, the Service Committee is as eager to follow the lead of the Holy Spirit as Paul was in the first century.

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:48.390
There are still many parts of the world where branches need publishers to step over and help them give a thorough witness.

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:58.390
To meet the need, the Service Committee has arranged for such branches to receive assistance by means of special preaching campaigns.

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:04.390
Local publishers and exemplary brothers and sisters from other lands are invited to participate.

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:13.390
Often, such publishers who respond to the initial invitation later decide to move to these areas of need.

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:23.390
In recent years, special preaching campaigns have been held in Africa, Asia, Europe and South America.

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.390
What have been some of the results of such special preaching campaigns?

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:37.390
In the recent past, more than a million Arabic-speaking refugees have fled to Europe.

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:46.390
The Service Committee arranged for the Central Europe branch to hold a special preaching campaign to reach these refugees.

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:55.390
More than 600 publishers from different parts of the world participated and they distributed some 30,000 pieces of literature.

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.390
Many of the refugees have been very receptive to the good news.

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:08.389
Even approaching publishers at the literature carts and asking, can you help us? What does the Bible actually teach?

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:18.900
This special campaign concluded with an Arabic language regional convention which was a milestone for the Arabic field.

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:30.900
Over 1,600 attended from 43 different countries. Approximately 25% of those in attendance were interested persons.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.900
Outstanding campaigns have also been held in Bulgaria.

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:43.900
In 2009, Bulgaria reported a publisher to population ratio of 1 to 4,600.

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:55.900
Since then, four special preaching campaigns have been held there and 1,782 publishers from countries throughout Europe participated.

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:09.900
They placed over 175,000 pieces of literature started 1,775 Bible studies and eight congregations and seven groups have been formed.

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:17.900
Consider one example. Before 2010, there were no witnesses in the village of Carlovo.

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:26.900
That year, a special preaching campaign was organized. As a result, a man named Gosho was contacted.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:37.900
From his own reading of the Bible, he realized that the local churches do not teach the truth, so he stopped attending church services, but never stopped praying.

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:46.900
During the campaign, he met Jehovah's Witnesses in the street. They wanted to talk with him about the Bible, but he interrupted them.

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:57.900
He interrupted them and asked, do you believe that Jesus is equal to God? The brothers answered, no.

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:05.900
Do you believe that God has a Trinity? Do you collect a taith? The brothers again answered, no.

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:16.899
Then your welcome in my home said Gosho. Immediately, a Bible study was started with him and his wife Ivanka and their son Bogomil.

00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:28.009
Both Ivanka and Bogomil are now baptized. Senegal has a vast, untouched territory.

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:43.009
In 2015, the country's publisher to population ratio was one to more than 12,000. In recent years, the service committee arranged for three special preaching campaigns in Senegal.

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:51.009
One sister from Portugal asked a householder if she believed that God had the power to resurrect the dead.

00:04:51.009 --> 00:05:03.009
In a ridiculing way, the woman replied, you mean my dead husband, who's been dead a long time will come out of the grave. Is this what you are telling me?

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:15.009
The sister answered, that is what God has promised to do. He will resurrect him alive in the flesh, seeing that the sister was serious.

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:27.009
The woman asked, is it really possible? The sister answered, it is written in God's word. With great joy, the woman started to dance.

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:36.009
The sister highlighted information on the resurrection in the listen to God brochure, again the woman started dancing with joy.

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:46.889
In Romania, there are some four and a half million people who live in unassigned territories.

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:59.889
During a two-month campaign, publishers covered 1,359 localities with the population of 1.8 million. The publishers started more than 1,000 Bible studies.

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:08.889
Here is just one experience. Castell and Luminica were very active in their Orthodox religion.

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:16.889
However, Luminica could not find answers to her Bible questions, and Castell saw much hypocrisy with the priests.

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:24.889
Luminica heard about Jehovah's Witnesses from her neighbor, who studied the Bible by telephone with a witness relative.

00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:29.889
During the special campaign, two brothers knocked on the couple's door.

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:38.889
Luminica was happy that Jehovah's Witnesses had finally come to preach in her village. She immediately accepted a Bible study.

00:06:38.889 --> 00:06:48.889
Eventually, Castell and their two teenage children joined in the study. The family immediately put into practice what they learned from the Bible.

00:06:48.889 --> 00:06:56.889
After the family learned on their own that witnesses do not celebrate birthdays, they told their study conductors.

00:06:56.889 --> 00:07:08.889
We don't want to keep sending against Jehovah. How many other things are we doing that Jehovah hates? Tell us everything that we are doing wrong so that we can stop.

00:07:08.889 --> 00:07:16.889
In seven months, the entire family began preaching with the congregation. After one month of sharing in the ministry,

00:07:16.889 --> 00:07:25.889
they had started three Bible studies in the village. One year after their first contact with Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:07:25.889 --> 00:07:31.889
Castell and Luminica were baptized at their first regional convention.

00:07:31.889 --> 00:07:39.889
Now, Castell is a ministerial servant, and both children are progressing very well spiritually.

00:07:39.889 --> 00:07:50.889
Have you ever shared in preaching and seldom worked or unassigned territories? Such concerted efforts have yielded great success in many countries.

00:07:50.889 --> 00:08:02.889
For example, the Brazil branch invited publishers throughout the branch territory to participate in a preaching effort that focused on the thousands living along the Amazon River.

00:08:02.889 --> 00:08:08.889
More than 10,000 local brothers and sisters gave their support.

00:08:08.889 --> 00:08:14.889
In one congregation's territory, some 400 people requested a Bible study.

00:08:14.889 --> 00:08:26.889
Many of those who participated in the preaching effort described it as a life-changing experience, and some decided to move to the Amazon region.

00:08:26.889 --> 00:08:40.889
In December 2015, five congregations in this region had a total of six elders, two ministerial servants, nine regular pioneers and 50 publishers.

00:08:40.889 --> 00:08:46.889
By July 2016, those numbers had increased tremendously.

00:08:46.889 --> 00:09:05.889
In those five congregations, the six elders increased to 22. The two ministerial servants increased to 17. The nine regular pioneers became 80, and the 50 publishers grew to 177.

00:09:05.889 --> 00:09:19.870
In total, over 865 publishers from Brazil permanently stepped over into the Amazon region, and seven new congregations were formed.

00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:34.870
It's clear that Jehovah is richly blessing such preaching efforts. Reports such as this strengthen our resolve to do all that our circumstances allow to reach as many as possible with the good news.
