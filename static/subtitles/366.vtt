00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:07.240
When Paul wrote the letter to the Colossians, it was in a year 60 to 61 CE,

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.560
just similar to the time that he wrote Ephesians that we talked about yesterday.

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:21.120
And he wrote for similar reasons to protect his brothers from the immoral environment that was around them and to encourage them to

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:23.519
fight against the weaknesses of the flesh.

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:30.320
So let's open our Bibles to Colossians chapter three and we'll read in its entirety verse five.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:31.839
Colossians three five.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.719
Den therefore your body members that are on the earth as respect sexual immorality,

00:00:39.439 --> 00:00:48.079
uncleanness, uncontrolled sexual passion, hurtful desire, and greediness, which is idolatry.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:57.759
And we've been told that these expressions convey the idea of totally wiping out these desires.

00:00:57.759 --> 00:01:02.399
When we sense them coming up in our heart and mind, we slay them, we wipe them out.

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:10.719
And it's very important because to fail to do that puts this into all sorts of difficulties with

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:15.920
Jehovah, with others and causes problems for ourselves.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.079
Look at verse six, on account of those things, the wrath of God is coming.

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:24.799
So it affects our everlasting future as well, doesn't it?

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.719
One thing that is highlighted here is how serious these desires can become.

00:01:31.519 --> 00:01:38.000
They get bound up with greediness, covetousness, which is idolatry.

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.519
And covetousness has been described as something that is insatiable.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.280
It's always after for something that should not have or does not have the right to have.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.120
It's ruthless self-seeking it has been defined as.

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:59.760
And a covetous person or a greedy person makes the object of his desire so strong

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.840
that in essence it can become his God.

00:02:04.879 --> 00:02:11.520
And that reminds us of the inspired words of Philippians 3, 18, and 19, where Paul used a similar

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.080
expression about those who used to be with him in the truth, but no longer were.

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:18.719
And he was very sad about that.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:20.879
And what happened to them?

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:28.400
Well, their God became their belly and their desires overwhelmed even their love for Jehovah.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.680
And it was back in 1978 that the watchtower and the April 1st issue

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:42.400
said this about this quality of greed and covetousness and idolatry and said this.

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:51.280
If we become aware of a wrong desire building up within ourselves, we do well to call to mind

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:57.199
how precious our relationship with God is and how senseless it would be to forfeit this

00:02:57.759 --> 00:03:00.560
by making oneself an idolater.

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:06.960
So that's a very serious thought, isn't it, that a person could actually start worshipping

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:09.360
something other than Jehovah.

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.840
And that was a very serious end even in ancient Israel, wasn't it?

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.360
This matter of idolatry, it carried the death penalty,

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.120
which you know, another aspect of the Ten Commandments that carried the death penalty

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:27.199
was adultery.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:35.919
So what is the similarity between idolatry and the death penalty and adultery and the death

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:43.120
penalty? Well, worshipping an idol, a person would break his covenant with Jehovah

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:49.039
and committing adultery, he would break his covenant with his spouse.

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:55.120
So why would Jehovah feel so strongly about that? Well, let's open her Bibles to Psalm 33.

00:03:56.159 --> 00:04:05.120
And we'll look at the kind of person Jehovah is when it comes to his word and what he says.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:14.560
Psalm 33, let's read verse four, for the word of Jehovah is upright and everything he does

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:23.600
is trustworthy. And then look at verse nine, for he spoke and it came to be. He commanded

00:04:24.319 --> 00:04:30.800
and it stood firm. So the Psalmist is saying when Jehovah says something, he means it.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.399
And so when a person says to Jehovah, I'm going to worship you exclusively and he doesn't,

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:46.160
it's treachery. It's unlike God, Jehovah. It's like the devil who is a liar and untrustworthy.

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:53.680
So it adds weight, doesn't it? To our desire, never to fall victim to idolatry in any form.

00:04:54.480 --> 00:05:02.800
Now, our comments in the watchtower that we'll read a little bit later today in the actual

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:08.959
printed comment does focus on this matter of marriage and adultery and avoiding that, of course.

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:18.639
And what we'd like to do now is just take a few moments and highlight some dangers that could come

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:24.319
up or married people and see how that applies to

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:33.040
deadening or slaying those desires right from the very beginning so that they do not flourish

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:38.720
and cause a problem. One of the principles that we can think about is Proverbs 22, 3,

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:46.800
we see the danger and we turn aside. So what are some things that we could see as a danger,

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:53.759
identify them and slay them before they become a problem? Well, obviously,

00:05:54.399 --> 00:06:03.519
what we look at, listen to and read fills our mind with either good or bad. So we avoid intake

00:06:03.519 --> 00:06:11.920
of bad things. It only fuels bad desires. But research has shown and our publications have often

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:21.680
commented on that when a person gets involved in adultery, it isn't always just a sexual greed

00:06:22.319 --> 00:06:27.759
or the sexual desire that motivates him to go down that path the first place

00:06:29.279 --> 00:06:36.800
or hurt to go down that path the first time. Well, what is it? Well, what is the fundamental

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:42.720
function of marriage? It has often been said that the fundamental function of marriage

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:52.800
is receiving and giving emotional support. It's a relationship where a person feels loved,

00:06:53.439 --> 00:07:01.279
appreciated, wanted and needed in a very special way. And when a person begins to feel that that is

00:07:01.279 --> 00:07:08.079
missing, then they begin looking for someone who can give them that, not necessarily right away

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:17.680
sexual gratification. And that's why the watchtower, or really the awake of January 8, 86 awake,

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:24.720
said this, being a good listener has the capacity for making the other person feel that he is

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:30.639
especially valued and what he is saying is of concern and significance to him.

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:38.879
So it's this relationship that needs to be guarded, the friendship. And the 1994 watchtower,

00:07:38.879 --> 00:07:46.079
the July 15, added weight to this comment when it quoted a divorce attorney of all people.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:52.079
And he said, what is the single biggest reason couples break up? And this is what he said,

00:07:52.079 --> 00:07:59.040
it was quoted in the magazine. The inability to talk honestly with each other, bear their souls

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:06.160
and treat each other as their best friend. That's the main reason. That can often lead to other

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:10.879
physical contact, but it often is not the one that gets it started.

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:19.199
So now, what can we do to avoid that? Well, we want to treasure relationships. And it reminds us

00:08:19.199 --> 00:08:28.079
of an experience that was given in the August 15, 2012 watchtower about an elder, also a pioneer,

00:08:28.079 --> 00:08:33.279
named Daniel, and his wife, pioneering. But he was very involved in the congregation.

00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:40.320
Always took on assignments. He had three Bible students, men who got baptized, but they needed a

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:45.440
lot of help. They were newly baptized. He was busy with other assignments. His wife spent a lot

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:52.960
of time with these newly baptized brothers. He was neglecting his wife. She bonded emotionally with

00:08:52.960 --> 00:09:01.440
one of these brothers. Adultery was committed. But Daniel said, he bore a heavy responsibility in

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:09.600
that respect. In fact, at the end of the lessons learned, he said this, there is much more to life

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:13.919
than struggling to care for privileges to the detriment of your own family.

00:09:14.879 --> 00:09:22.000
So the need for balance, pursuing kingdom entries, of course, and understanding why

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:28.240
for a husband can understand and support that, but there is a balance. And if it oversteps itself,

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:37.840
then real problems can result. So we want to do all we can to slay desires when we sense them in

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:44.159
ourselves. And it's going to take ironist effort. It's going to take endurance because as long

00:09:44.159 --> 00:09:50.320
as we're in this imperfect state, no one can say I am immune to any of those desires that could

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:56.480
crop up at different times. So our love for Jehovah, our love for our mates, our love for our brothers

00:09:56.480 --> 00:10:02.480
prevent us from going down the path of greediness and adultery, which only results to harm.

00:10:03.279 --> 00:10:08.000
How grateful we are to be with brothers and sisters like you who love Jehovah,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.519
love their marriage mates, love the brotherhood, and do all we can to stay morally clean.

00:10:13.519 --> 00:10:18.399
Keep it up with Jehovah's help.
