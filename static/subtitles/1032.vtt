00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:10.480
The Bible is a book of facts. It's about real people, real events, real history and real places.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:17.480
In the Hebrew scriptures, there are at least 53 people confirmed archaeologically.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.480
One example is Pharaoh Shishak of Egypt.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:30.480
The Bible mentions his invasion of Judah, specifically dating it in the fifth year of Judean king Rehupua.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:37.479
For a long time, the only record of that invasion was the one found in the Bible.

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:45.479
Then, a relief on the wall of a temple at Karnak, Egypt was discovered depicting Shishak with captives.

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:53.479
It also records names of conquered Israelite towns, many of which have been identified with biblical sites.

00:00:54.479 --> 00:01:05.480
It also mentions the field of Abram, the earliest reference in Egyptian records to the biblical patriarch Abram.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:12.480
This strengthens our confidence and faith in the Bible as God's word.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:18.480
The Bible was written on perishable materials such as papyrus and parchment.

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:25.480
While no originals are known to exist today, the number of ancient copies available now is staggering.

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:33.480
Some 11,000 Hebrew and Greek manuscripts, more than for any other ancient piece of literature.

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:44.480
By comparing the earliest, most authoritative manuscripts, scholars can identify inaccuracies and mistakes that have crept in.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:49.480
The vast majority of differences do not change the meaning at all.

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:56.480
One example is found at Luke 417, which says that Jesus opened the skull of Isaiah.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:01.480
But some manuscripts say that he unrolled the skull.

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.480
But isn't the meaning the same?

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:09.479
God's message has even survived changes in language.

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:17.479
Writers of the Christian Greek scriptures quoted the Hebrew scriptures, but often from the Greek Septuagint translation.

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:25.479
At times, they paraphrase such quotations using slightly different wording, but the message remained the same.

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:32.479
And most of Jesus' words, likely spoken in 1st century Hebrew, were recorded in Greek.

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:35.479
Still, his message is clear.

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:42.479
Today, at least parts of God's word can be read in more than 3,000 languages.

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:46.479
The Bible's survival reveals a puzzling paradox.

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:53.479
Throughout history, people were willing to die to preserve the Bible and make it available to everyone.

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:59.479
Others were willing to kill, to prevent access to it and wipe it out of existence.

00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:00.479
Why?

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:02.479
It's the book's content.

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:06.479
God's word is alive and exerts power.

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:14.479
It changes people's lives in ways that some welcome, but others resist violently at times.

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:24.479
For example, responding to Roman Emperor Diocletians' edict in 303 CE to destroy the sacred scriptures by fire,

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:28.479
Felix, the bishop of Tibyuka, reportedly said,

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:32.479
it is better for me to be burned than the sacred scriptures.

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:35.479
He paid with his life.

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:44.479
Efforts to destroy God's message for mankind continue today, but the word of our God endures forever.
