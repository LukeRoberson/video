00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:08.300
There are times when peace can be threatened.

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:15.140
I found that out firsthand.

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:29.600
We both said things we wish we hadn't.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:37.310
I thought she was just being too sensitive.

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:41.310
I couldn't even concentrate on the meeting.

00:00:41.310 --> 00:01:00.990
I thought, why is she overreacting?

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:08.439
I felt like telling someone.

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:12.439
Maybe I should talk to my friends.

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:40.489
I thought about calling her relative.

00:01:40.489 --> 00:01:57.219
Maybe I should just go to the elders.

00:01:57.219 --> 00:02:14.389
It was disturbing my sleep.

00:02:14.389 --> 00:02:16.389
It's all I could think about.

00:02:16.389 --> 00:02:42.150
The next day, I volunteered to work at a Kingdom Hall project.

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:52.289
But earlier that morning,

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:56.289
I read Matthew 523 and 24,

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:57.289
where it says,

00:02:57.289 --> 00:03:00.289
if then you are bringing your gift to the altar

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:04.289
and there you remember that your brother has something against you,

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:07.289
leave your gift there in front of the altar and go away.

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:10.289
First, make your peace with your brother

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:13.289
and then come back and offer your gift.

00:03:13.289 --> 00:04:01.669
How could I make a sacrifice to Jehovah

00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:05.669
when I'm not at peace with my sister?

00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:09.669
I had to leave my gift and first make peace.

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:31.639
Billy talked from the heart.

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:39.269
I didn't want to lose my sister,

00:04:39.269 --> 00:04:47.040
and she didn't want to lose me.

00:04:47.040 --> 00:05:05.000
It's amazing how wonderful it feels when you make peace.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:11.610
I am so happy.

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:16.819
I not only gained my sister back,

00:05:16.819 --> 00:05:23.180
but I gained a truer and deeper friend.

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:34.740
My relationship with the congregation is stronger

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:38.740
and I feel closer to Jehovah.
