00:00:01.389 --> 00:00:07.349
You know, our text today in the comments that we just heard center attention on our Christian hope

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:13.609
Very soon our loving father Jehovah is going to eliminate pain suffering

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:16.390
death and

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:24.829
Indeed as has been committed on the happy memories will just push out all the bad memories the former things will indeed have passed away

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:30.510
Now when I thought about Revelation chapter 21 verses 3 and 4 I thought to myself

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.710
I've heard those words

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:39.310
Hundreds of times and I've probably shared those words hundreds of times in our ministry and

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:45.810
While most of us through repetition have probably memorized those sacred thoughts a

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:48.229
Good question. I thought it would be

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:53.590
Helpful to think about is are these basic scriptural truths

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.390
Still strengthening me now are they as brother cotton just mentioned still serving as an

00:01:00.509 --> 00:01:02.509
anchor for my soul

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.629
With that thought in mind, let's consider three questions

00:01:07.349 --> 00:01:10.950
What is the hope as described in the scriptures?

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:18.269
Secondly, why do we need hope and third? How can we strengthen our hope?

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:22.109
First, how would you define hope?

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.670
Back in 1993 the watchtower quoted a writer who said this

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.989
Most people seem to think that hope is just a dopey form of denying the truth

00:01:35.989 --> 00:01:41.469
Others today would equate hope with optimism or wishful thinking and

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.510
Of course the scriptures encourage positive thinking and there are benefits

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.310
Emotionally and perhaps even physically

00:01:49.989 --> 00:01:54.629
But what do we call a desire or a wish that's not based on truth?

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:59.750
What is a desire or a wish that does not take Jehovah into an account?

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:02.230
Well, that's a dream

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:11.310
That's an unreality and of course none of us is true Christians want to live in Lala land or in a dream world, do we?

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.110
Of course the Bible does not use the word optimism

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.310
But it does encourage us to strengthen our hope

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:23.789
What is hope according to the scriptures?

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:29.069
The original language were used in the Bible that are translated hope

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.229
Mean to wait eagerly and to expect good

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.349
In the scriptures hope involves not only the desire for something good

00:02:38.469 --> 00:02:40.469
But it includes the basis

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:43.389
For believing that good will come

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:46.270
That's much more meaningful than optimism

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.310
Hope like our faith is based on evidence

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.110
convincing facts

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:58.310
And though hope involves our eager desire for something good

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:03.189
It does not to start with our desires what we want or what we wish for

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.389
It's first rooted in what God wants

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:11.590
With regard to his purpose and what God wants for us individually

00:03:12.669 --> 00:03:18.349
Romans chapter 5 and verse 5 tells us that such hope does not lead to disappointment

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:28.069
So in a brief definition we could say that scriptural hope is eager expectation based on future realities

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:30.789
rooted in what Jehovah has taught us

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.110
Our second question

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:37.509
Why is hope essential for all Christians?

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:42.830
Please open your Bible with me to Hebrews chapter 11 and verse 1

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:47.270
And notice our well-known definition of faith

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.030
But then notice how hope is associated

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.030
Hebrews chapter 11 and verse 1 says

00:03:55.389 --> 00:03:59.389
Faith is the assured expectation of what is

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:04.150
hoped for the evident demonstration of

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.030
realities that are not seen

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:12.949
So just as faith is a requirement for us to serve Jehovah

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:22.589
Acceptably for our worship to not be in vain hope as an essential element of faith is also necessary for all Christians

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:27.029
To see the connection between faith and hope a little better

00:04:27.149 --> 00:04:30.310
We might think about the example of Abraham

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:34.269
Now from a human standpoint Abraham and Sarah

00:04:34.829 --> 00:04:39.629
Were way past child-bearing age when Jehovah promised them a son?

00:04:40.269 --> 00:04:45.790
It's interesting that in the Scriptures both Abraham and Sarah laughed at the angelic announcement

00:04:46.029 --> 00:04:52.829
It was an amazing and tickling prospect to them to think that they would have a baby in their older years

00:04:53.589 --> 00:04:57.589
But how did Abraham respond to the promise?

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:01.550
Notice please in Romans chapter 4 and verse 18

00:05:02.269 --> 00:05:04.269
What the Bible says

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:08.550
linked to this discussion of the need for hope

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:11.670
Romans chapter 4 and verse 18 says

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:21.230
Although beyond hope yet based on hope he had faith that he would become the father of many nations according to what had been said

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:23.790
So your offspring will be

00:05:25.709 --> 00:05:30.790
Faith based on hope we see the connection better don't we?

00:05:31.069 --> 00:05:38.110
You see Abraham's God-given hope gave his faith that he would have a son a firm foundation

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:42.910
His faith in turn brightened and strengthened his hope

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:52.910
So it was not only this conviction in his heart, but it was the eager anticipation of seeing what Jehovah had promised come to fulfillment

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:57.269
Another reason that we need hope

00:05:57.829 --> 00:06:05.430
Has to do with the storms that you and I are undoubtedly facing now or will face before the end of the system comes

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:09.269
In Paul's letter to the Hebrews he illustrated

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:13.550
Hope as an anchor for the soul both sure and firm

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:22.949
So when confronting storms what do sailors both in ancient times end today often do they lower the ship's anchor

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:30.269
Why well if the anchor takes hold of the firm seabed it helps the ship ride out the storm

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:34.550
It keeps that ship away from dangerous reefs or the shoreline

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:41.509
Interestingly when the Apostle Paul was on that ship on route to Rome in the year 58 CE

00:06:41.509 --> 00:06:45.990
The ship was in danger of running aground the Bible tells us that the

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:52.870
sailors cast out four anchors not just one four from the stern stern and

00:06:53.389 --> 00:06:56.110
As a result the ship safely wrote out the storm

00:06:56.949 --> 00:07:01.709
Well, it's not hard to see the connection with hope and our stormy times today is it our

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:09.110
Our sure and firm hope our setting our mind with eager expectation of what Jehovah has promised keeps us

00:07:09.589 --> 00:07:15.949
Emotionally mentally and spiritually balanced no matter what is raging around us in our life in

00:07:16.269 --> 00:07:21.310
Full-time service with our family with our finances with our health

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:27.269
We can weather the storms because of our eager expectation of what Jehovah has promised

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:37.430
Really fewer things could be more stabilizing in our life than this eager expectation of what Jehovah the God who does not lie has promised to us

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:40.870
Well that leads to a third question

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:43.870
How can we strengthen our hope?

00:07:44.629 --> 00:07:48.310
Well as has been commented on beautifully by our four commenters

00:07:48.589 --> 00:07:53.790
We need to think specifically about how Jehovah's promises

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:55.829
Apply to us

00:07:55.829 --> 00:08:01.269
What they will mean for us and our family in the near future

00:08:02.149 --> 00:08:05.910
Though we serve Jehovah out of love and that's our principal motivation

00:08:06.509 --> 00:08:11.350
Jehovah wants us to think about the rewards that he has outlined for us in the scriptures

00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:16.709
He wants us to visualize and meditate on such blessings

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:21.910
One sister and referring to the beautiful artwork that's in our magazines said this

00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:28.990
When I see pictures of the coming paradise. I examine them closely as one would a travel brochure

00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:37.110
I endeavour to see myself there because this is where I truly hope to be in God's due time

00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:40.950
Daydreaming no

00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:47.789
Meditation on truths on precious promises that will not lie. Yes

00:08:48.789 --> 00:08:53.029
Notice please with me at second Peter chapter three verses 11 and 12

00:08:54.230 --> 00:09:00.429
How the inspired council encourages us to strengthen and build up our hope and view of what's coming

00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:04.990
Second Peter chapter three. Let's read together verses 11 and 12

00:09:06.789 --> 00:09:09.909
Since all these things are to be dissolved in this way

00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:16.110
With regard to what we're expecting in the near future with the great tribulation leading into Armageddon

00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:22.110
Consider what sort of people you ought to be in holy acts of conduct and deeds of God the devotion as

00:09:22.669 --> 00:09:26.309
You await and keep close in mind

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:35.669
The presence of the day of Jehovah through which the heavens will be destroyed in flames and the elements will melt in the intense heat

00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:39.830
Notice in verse 12 that expression keep close in mind

00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:43.350
eagerly desire literally speed up

00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:50.549
Do you see how our positive meditation our visualizing what's to come will strengthen us?

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:53.750
Yes meaningful prayer

00:09:53.909 --> 00:09:55.909
Meaningful Bible study

00:09:55.909 --> 00:10:01.429
Meaningful reflection will help us to keep Jehovah's Day close in mind

00:10:01.429 --> 00:10:09.269
It will help us to rejoice in the hope and then we will experience the realization of all that we've hoped for

00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:12.190
From the God who cannot lie
