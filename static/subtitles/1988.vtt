00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:09.839
And in production to first Thessalonians, the Apostle Paul wrote this inspired letter

00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:17.940
in Corinth, likely late in the year 50 CE during his second missionary tour.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:24.500
Sometime after arriving in Thessalonica, Paul preached in the synagogue for three sabbaths.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.379
Soon a congregation was established there.

00:00:29.379 --> 00:00:35.539
Opposers from among the Jews became jealous of Paul's success and incited a violent mob.

00:00:35.539 --> 00:00:42.140
The congregation continued preaching, even after sending Paul and Silas to Berea.

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.899
First Thessalonians has five chapters.

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:52.899
In chapter 1, Paul warmly commends the congregation for the way they accepted God's word and endured

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:55.659
under tribulation.

00:00:55.659 --> 00:01:02.100
He informs them that their example of perseverance has become known to the congregations in Macedonia

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.079
and Achaea.

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:11.000
In chapter 2, Paul reminds Thessalonians of his tender affection for them and how he worked

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.420
hard to avoid being an expensive burden on them.

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:18.939
Did you know?

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:22.379
The Apostle Paul was a tent maker by trade.

00:01:22.379 --> 00:01:29.370
He may have done this work to cover his expenses in Thessalonica.

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:34.650
In chapter 3, Paul writes that he had sent Timothy to Thessalonica to build up their

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:35.650
faith.

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:42.250
Now Timothy has returned to Paul with good news of their spiritual prosperity.

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:47.890
In chapter 4, Paul comforts those who have lost loved ones and death.

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:55.010
Jesus' resurrection is a guarantee that those sleeping in the grave will rise.

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:00.370
In chapter 5, Paul describes future events that will lead to the destruction of God's

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:05.040
enemies during Jehovah's Day.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.560
He calls those who live by God's standards, sons of light, in contrast with those who reject

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.259
God's standards.

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:21.780
He advises the congregation to stay spiritually awake, to make sure of all things, to pray

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:27.590
constantly, and to encourage one another.

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:33.150
As you read the first inspired letter to the Thessalonians, note how our perseverance and

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.669
the face of opposition can encourage others.

00:02:36.669 --> 00:02:42.669
How the resurrection hope comforts and strengthens those who have lost loved ones and death.

00:02:42.669 --> 00:02:47.990
And how Jesus Christ, the King of God's Kingdom, will destroy all of God's enemies.
