00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:04.910
Our text comments today highlight this point about a husband.

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:09.910
Notice it says, although he cannot always do as she that is his wife asks,

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:14.910
he often arrives at a more balanced decision by consulting her.

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.910
Well, those of us who are husbands know the truthfulness of those words, don't we?

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.910
Now, there are a number of qualities that this statement may bring to mind,

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.910
and one of those qualities is the quality of reasonableness.

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.910
That's a quality that all of us need to display.

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.909
How would you describe a reasonable person?

00:00:35.909 --> 00:00:39.909
What examples of reasonableness do we find in Jehovah and Jesus?

00:00:39.909 --> 00:00:42.909
And what can we learn from their example?

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:45.909
Well, let's first consider that description.

00:00:45.909 --> 00:00:51.909
Our publications have stated that a reasonable person is patient, gentle, and kind

00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:54.909
in his dealings with himself and with others.

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:59.909
He takes into consideration others' limitations and their circumstances.

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:06.909
Someone with a reputation of being reasonable is flexible when circumstances warranted.

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:12.909
It's like that husband that we just mentioned when he is reasonable as he consults with his wife.

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:18.909
He's willing to listen to her and when appropriate to go along with her wishes.

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:22.909
Now, notice with me at Philippians chapter four, verse five,

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:26.909
the inspired counsel about this quality of reasonableness.

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.909
Please turn there, Philippians chapter four,

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.909
and notice what the Bible tells us in the A portion of verse five.

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:41.700
It states, let your reasonableness become known to all men.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.700
So others should see us displaying this quality.

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:52.700
Another translation renders the verse, have a reputation for being reasonable.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:58.700
So notice, it's not so much how we view ourselves, whether we feel we're reasonable.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:06.700
Rather, it's how others see us, how we are known if we have the reputation of being reasonable.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.699
When you think about it, reasonableness attracts, doesn't it?

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:16.699
Whereas unreasonableness tends to drive away.

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:23.699
Well, now that we have that description, what examples of reasonableness do we find in Jehovah and Jesus?

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:25.699
Let's consider Jehovah's example first.

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:32.699
And if you turn with me to Leviticus chapter five, let's look at an example of his reasonableness with the nation of Israel.

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:39.699
Leviticus chapter five, and notice there in verse five to begin.

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:46.699
It says, if he becomes guilty as respects one of these things, talking about someone who's committed a sin,

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:49.699
says then he must confess in what he has sined.

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:57.699
Verse six, he will also bring his guilt offering to Jehovah for the sin that he committed, namely a female from the flock,

00:02:57.699 --> 00:03:02.699
either a female lamb or a young female goat for a sin offering.

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:04.699
So that was plain.

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:08.699
But notice, Jehovah's reasonableness, verse seven.

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:18.699
If, though, he cannot afford a sheep, he must bring to Jehovah two turtle doves or two young pigeons as his guilt offering for the sin.

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:21.699
So that was reasonable on Jehovah's part.

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:25.699
But Jehovah took it a step further. Notice verse 11.

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:37.699
Now, if he cannot afford two turtle doves or two young pigeons, he must bring us his offering for his sin a tenth of an effa of fine flour for a sin offering.

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:45.699
So notice, Jehovah was reasonable in what he expected depending on the Israelites' financial circumstances.

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:49.699
As we read verse 11, you may have wondered, well, what's a tenth of an effa?

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:52.699
Well, our footnote helps us. You notice what it says?

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:59.699
A tenth of an effa equaled 2.2 liters or two dry quarts.

00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:10.699
Notice this image of an Israelite woman. She's a very limited means, and she's holding out possibly to give to the priest her sin offering of two quarts of flour.

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:13.699
It wasn't much, was it?

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:20.699
Here in Leviticus, it was as if Jehovah was saying, if you don't have enough for a lamb or a goat, that's okay.

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:25.699
If you don't have enough for those two small birds, don't worry.

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:30.699
Just bring me two quarts of flour as your sacrifice.

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:43.699
Well, imagine how happy a poor Israelite, like this woman, would have been, that Jehovah valued her small offering just as much as one of the costlier sacrifices presented by her wealthier neighbors.

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:48.699
But did you notice an important detail there in verse 11 about the flour?

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:54.699
The flour that the needy Israelite was to offer wasn't just any type of flour. Did you see there in the verse?

00:04:54.699 --> 00:05:02.699
It was to be fine flour, such as that used to prepare meal for an honored guest.

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:10.699
So though the poor Israelite couldn't give as much as others, the little they offered to Jehovah was to be their best.

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:19.699
In effect, Jehovah was saying, I realize you can't offer as much as others, but I know, I know that you're going to give me your best.

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:21.699
What's the lesson?

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:29.699
Jehovah displays reasonableness by taking into consideration our limitations and our circumstances.

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:35.699
You know, some brothers and sisters can offer in their service the equivalent of a lamb or a goat.

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:39.699
Others can offer the equivalent of two turtle doves or two pigeons.

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:49.699
And perhaps in the past, some of us were able to offer the same in our assignments, but right now because of our circumstances, because of limitations, maybe we're not able to.

00:05:49.699 --> 00:06:02.699
Well, what we know about Jehovah, he graciously and reasonably accepts our best in his service, even if that's comparable to two quarts of fine flour.

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:15.699
What a reasonable God we worship and a good lesson for us to be reasonable and not compare ourselves with others or to expect more than we should of our brothers and sisters.

00:06:15.699 --> 00:06:18.699
Now, what about Jesus example?

00:06:18.699 --> 00:06:25.699
He said an example in reasonableness by being patient and kind in his dealings with his disciples despite their shortcomings.

00:06:25.699 --> 00:06:27.699
Let's notice an example.

00:06:27.699 --> 00:06:30.699
Turn with me to Luke chapter 22.

00:06:30.699 --> 00:06:38.699
And let's notice an example of Jesus' reasonableness, Luke 22, the setting shortly before Jesus' death.

00:06:38.699 --> 00:06:42.699
And he's aware that Peter is soon going to deny him three times.

00:06:42.699 --> 00:06:44.699
So what did Jesus do?

00:06:44.699 --> 00:06:47.699
He encouraged Peter, notice verse 32.

00:06:48.699 --> 00:06:53.699
Jesus said, but I've made supplication for you, that your faith may not give out.

00:06:53.699 --> 00:06:58.699
And you, once you've returned, strengthen your brothers.

00:06:58.699 --> 00:07:00.699
Notice the encouragement?

00:07:00.699 --> 00:07:02.699
Jesus said, I've made supplication for you.

00:07:02.699 --> 00:07:07.699
In other words, Jesus prayed in Peter's behalf that Peter's faith not give out.

00:07:07.699 --> 00:07:12.699
And then he told him, once you've returned, strengthen your brothers.

00:07:12.699 --> 00:07:20.699
Jesus expressed confidence that Peter, after a short lapse, would return to faithful service and he would strengthen his brothers.

00:07:20.699 --> 00:07:27.699
And that despite the fact you notice in verse 34, Jesus told him, you're going to deny me three times.

00:07:27.699 --> 00:07:32.699
Now, how does this account show reasonableness on Jesus' part?

00:07:32.699 --> 00:07:37.699
Well, you may remember what Jesus had said sometime earlier as recorded at Matthew chapter 10 verse 33.

00:07:38.699 --> 00:07:44.699
He said, whoever disowns me before men, I will also disown him.

00:07:44.699 --> 00:07:47.699
Now, that was a strong statement.

00:07:47.699 --> 00:07:50.699
And Jesus could have applied that to Peter.

00:07:50.699 --> 00:07:54.699
But demonstrating reasonableness, Jesus didn't reject Peter.

00:07:54.699 --> 00:07:56.699
Why?

00:07:56.699 --> 00:08:00.699
Because Jesus knew that there were going to be extenuating circumstances.

00:08:00.699 --> 00:08:07.699
He was willing to forgive his repentant apostle and express confidence in what Peter would do in the future.

00:08:07.699 --> 00:08:12.699
So the lesson, we should look for the good in our brothers.

00:08:12.699 --> 00:08:15.699
But the explain highlighted that on Saturday for us, didn't he?

00:08:15.699 --> 00:08:21.699
Despite their imperfections, we should express confidence and faith in our brothers.

00:08:21.699 --> 00:08:24.699
We should be reasonable in what we expect of others.

00:08:24.699 --> 00:08:25.699
Who knows?

00:08:26.699 --> 00:08:32.700
They may be facing challenges that we either don't know about or that we don't fully understand.

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:35.700
One watchtower stated this.

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:44.700
How much better it is to commend our brothers for what they do than to judge them for what they do not do?

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:51.700
Like Jesus, let's be reasonable when love calls for it and circumstances warrant it.

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:54.700
Well, what if we consider?

00:08:54.700 --> 00:09:01.700
A reasonable person is patient, kind and gentle and is dealings with himself and with others.

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:06.700
He takes into consideration the limitations and the circumstances of others.

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:09.700
Reasonableness attracts.

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:13.700
Unreasonableness tends to drive away.

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:19.700
What excellent examples we have in reasonableness with Jehovah and Jesus, you remember the fine flower?

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:24.700
And the need to look for the good in others, expressing confidence in them.

00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:32.700
So as we go about our day, may we look for opportunities to let our reasonableness become known to all men.
