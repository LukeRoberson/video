00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:11.289
The fact is we are at war, there is an intense battle to control our minds.

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:17.449
We have the spirit of the world which surrounds us and can, in fact, are thinking.

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:22.570
They have a demon inspired teachings that are at their base.

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.809
And then we deal with our own imperfect inclinations.

00:00:26.809 --> 00:00:32.009
On top of that, each of us has a traitor within him.

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.969
All of us do, our heart, which the Bible describes as more treacherous than anything else.

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:44.310
Now, when we consider the forces that we are fighting against in this war, we could

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:55.369
not possibly win the war on our own, but with help from Jehovah we can't lose.

00:00:55.369 --> 00:01:02.090
Now, sadly, the enemy has been able to get some from among us, and these have become

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.569
battle casualties.

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:09.510
But as long as we keep on the complete suit of armor, described in the Bible in the book

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:16.170
of Ephesians 6, we are going to avoid becoming a casualty.

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.930
There is no secret formula, it is right there in the Scriptures.

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:26.090
And there is one particular part of the armor that relates to our text for today that we

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:27.849
would like to sit here on.

00:01:27.849 --> 00:01:33.290
And that is the helmet of salvation.

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.849
Now why does the Bible use the expression helmet of salvation?

00:01:36.849 --> 00:01:43.530
Well, because just as a soldier was protecting his head, where his brain was, which drives

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:51.290
all of the senses, so the helmet of salvation protects our minds.

00:01:51.290 --> 00:02:04.290
The March 2021 watchtower, page 29 says this, Jehovah will protect you, how?

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:09.530
Well just as a literal helmet protects the soldier's head, the hope of salvation protects

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.810
our thinking ability.

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:19.250
And that hope keeps us focused on God's promises and helps us to see problems in the right

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:20.250
perspective.

00:02:20.889 --> 00:02:24.050
That's a lot to digest.

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.210
But think about this.

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:34.889
Thinking ability is not to be confused with independent thinking, which Satan promotes.

00:02:34.889 --> 00:02:39.969
One indication of independent thinking is the question, the counsel that we receive

00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:44.810
from the visible part of Jehovah's organization through the faithful slave.

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:51.650
For example, God's organization has given us warnings, time and again, about listening

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:58.210
to the type, certain types of music, watching out for photographic material, being very

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:05.810
careful, frequenting clubs and world-late dance halls and the improper use of alcoholic

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.090
beverages.

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:14.530
And there are other matters too, but thinking ability will prevent us from rationalizing

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.569
that such counsel really doesn't apply to me.

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:23.650
I know how to skirt around the problems that these things might bring.

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:31.849
But unfortunately, there is independent thinking that at times comes from our very fellow

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:32.849
worshipers.

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:41.409
For example, if you ever heard someone say, you're still just a housewife, times have changed.

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:44.409
Why don't you go get a job?

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:49.569
For the expression pioneering is not for everyone.

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:54.250
You need more training and education if you're going to make it into today's world.

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.969
Let them tap your talents and skills.

00:03:58.969 --> 00:04:06.039
I feel the best way to help my dispelorship relative is to stay in touch with him.

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:08.360
But you know what?

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:15.560
Thinking ability is what protects us from these and other reasonings that don't reflect

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.879
your hova's thinking on matters.

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:25.160
And since God created us in His image, it's only logical and realistic that we can have

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:31.319
thinking ability only if we adopt God's way of thinking.

00:04:31.319 --> 00:04:37.519
Would you read with me please, Proverbs chapter 1 and verse 7?

00:04:37.519 --> 00:04:46.759
Notice, the fear of Jehovah is the beginning of knowledge in the latter part only fools

00:04:47.399 --> 00:04:51.569
despise wisdom and discipline.

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:58.970
Now in large, most respond favorably to Jehovah's way of thinking.

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:04.730
That's why we're part of a beautiful organization that is at peace with itself and knows how

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:07.730
to navigate the problems of the world.

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:15.730
We're being trained by Jehovah to use our thinking ability individually but not independently,

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:21.730
so depending on the circumstances, Bible principles generally allow for varying conclusions

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:24.209
on matters.

00:05:24.209 --> 00:05:30.089
But when we think independently of God, then that's when we get into trouble.

00:05:30.089 --> 00:05:36.170
We give into our own selfish, sinful inclinations.

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:43.449
But we undoubtedly make Jehovah's heart glad when we do what the Bible describes written

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:44.449
by Paul.

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:52.490
If you turn there on your devices to 2 Corinthians chapter 10, notice what he says there in verses

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:56.600
4 and 5 under inspiration.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:06.040
For the weapons of our warfare are not fleshly but powerful by God for overturning strongly

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:08.319
entrenched things.

00:06:08.319 --> 00:06:14.000
For we are overturning reasonings and every lofty thing raised up against the knowledge

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.920
of God.

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:23.240
And we are bringing every thought into captivity to make it obedient to the Christ.

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:26.160
Isn't that interesting?

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:30.439
And it's a beautiful thing to see among Jehovah's people in general.

00:06:30.439 --> 00:06:38.199
Godly thinking allows us to see the consequences of our actions before we take the action,

00:06:38.199 --> 00:06:42.439
whether the consequences are going to be good or bad.

00:06:42.439 --> 00:06:48.439
Now the nation of Israel was privileged to have Jehovah's guidance in detail.

00:06:48.439 --> 00:06:51.879
But as a whole, what happened?

00:06:51.879 --> 00:06:54.519
They refused it.

00:06:54.519 --> 00:07:01.420
Moses, if you turn to Deuteronomy chapter 32, Moses there is inspired to say of them in

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:10.439
verses 28 and 29 this, for they are a nation devoid of sense.

00:07:10.439 --> 00:07:17.040
We might say common sense, or as the footnote says, death to advice.

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:25.519
And there is no understanding among them, verse 29, if only they were wise, they would

00:07:25.519 --> 00:07:30.360
ponder over this, they would think about their outcome.

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:32.360
Isn't that beautiful?

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:36.759
Jehovah allows us to see the outcome of any action that we take.

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:43.319
Now in these last days, thinking ability is being put to the greatest test of all time,

00:07:43.319 --> 00:07:47.959
with Satan practicing greater deception than ever before.

00:07:47.959 --> 00:07:53.600
One of the helps that Jehovah's organization has provided is the publication scriptures

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:56.800
for Christian living.

00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:02.040
And let me read to you what the introduction of that publication says.

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:08.000
This for Christian living will make it easy for you to locate Bible verses and accounts

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.959
that can help you deal with the challenges you face.

00:08:12.959 --> 00:08:21.600
You will soon find a wealth of relevant and useful counsel, guidance and comfort from

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:23.680
God's work.

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:27.920
What a wonderful privilege we have to be taught by Jehovah.

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:31.720
Final text, Proverbs chapter 3.

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:33.279
This is 21 and 22.

00:08:33.279 --> 00:08:36.279
Here's what it says.

00:08:36.279 --> 00:08:43.320
Safeguard practical wisdom and thinking ability, they will give you life.
