00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:10.039
An excellent example of one who gave of his time and energy is Brother Max Larson.

00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:17.160
He served at World Headquarters for over 72 years until his death in 2011.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.480
He saw firsthand many exciting developments in our modern-day history.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:35.950
In this archive interview, please observe how Brother Larson trusted in Jehovah's direction.

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:40.070
The photograph was part of our work back at that time.

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.630
Had records of the time made them material dissolving in water.

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:47.829
And out in Washington state you get a lot of rain.

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:51.109
And one drop on that record and it'll hit it room to record.

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:55.789
So we had to try to keep out of the rain and then we started playing a record and started

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:56.789
out.

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:02.149
Something said that religion is a snare in a racket that kind of gives people attention.

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:07.469
It served very well for them to find a probation for carrying on-the- ministry work used

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:09.469
in every day.

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:14.069
Especially when in the special pioneer work, that's 200 hours a month, it keeps it pretty

00:01:14.069 --> 00:01:15.069
busy.

00:01:15.069 --> 00:01:19.310
I did that four months before I came to Bethel and all that time I used to photograph.

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:30.109
Back in the Depression day did a lot of trading.

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:34.430
So this day I traded for books for a big bag of pairs.

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:39.390
Like, he owned about 9 to 30, I stayed up in the attic getting a ball in there for the

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.390
Al Hoffman.

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.829
It was one of the noinons and he was the district overseer in that trailer.

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:49.469
So I went over to him and asked him like, he has some pairs and he said, oh, my teacher

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:50.469
love to have some pairs.

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:51.469
He said, come on in.

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:53.430
So he says sit down.

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.469
He says, you ever think about the Bible house?

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:56.469
I said, what's that?

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:58.109
That's what they call Bethel at the time.

00:01:58.109 --> 00:01:59.909
He started explaining Bethel.

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.790
He said to seven and a half hours of those so wonderful hearing about Bethel, I was so excited

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:05.790
about it.

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.870
So instead of going up and going to Bethel, I went up in my room, got my paper and pencil,

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:13.110
I wrote the letters of society, asked for a Bethel application, but I mailed the letter

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.870
and it would come back to Bethel.

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.909
So I kept in mind every day and prayer to Jehovah.

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:21.069
And four months I got my call.

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:24.069
Very short letter, a couple of few lines.

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:28.229
We have your application and come right away we can use you.

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:31.909
So then those days you didn't get on a plane and ride.

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:32.909
You get on a bus.

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:37.610
There were six days, six nights on a bus in the wintertime, blizzard in Montana, blizzard

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.710
in North Dakota, and I'm finally out to New York.

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:47.289
Well, first assignment brother, the North took me down to the shipping department.

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:50.050
So he had me tying cartons for a week.

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.650
And then brother, the North came down and took me up to the press room.

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.729
And he said, we're getting a new press in three months.

00:02:56.729 --> 00:03:00.330
The Colorado is going to run that, now if you can learn to run this, you can operate.

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.330
Soon three months while I was operating, I operated for a year and a half.

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.370
And then one day brother, the North came down again after a year and a half and

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.090
hired a life to work in the office.

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.050
Well, brother, the North, that's the last job I would think.

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:16.289
So then he started introducing me to type work I had to do.

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:19.689
And then he's made a statement I never forgot and still using.

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:23.729
If you want to spoil a manager and give him death's work, a manager belongs to the people

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:24.729
are, works being done.

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:28.370
You go through this plant twice a day, so learn to do that.

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:34.330
So then I did that for his assistant being trained for a year and a half.

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.409
And then one night, everybody gone home.

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:37.409
It's an open office.

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:40.729
His death's about 15 feet from mine.

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:44.169
And he said, I just got a call.

00:03:44.169 --> 00:03:45.169
Papi just went home.

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:49.370
I was going to call from San Diego, Papi was rather for the die.

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.490
He didn't send him more for a minute to then produce the well.

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:55.289
And he says, Max, I'll have to stay over at 124 and take care of the world.

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:57.370
You take the factory.

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:58.969
I didn't sleep too much at night.

00:03:58.969 --> 00:04:02.530
So I only had three years of Beth's experience.

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:08.000
So then from then on, I had the factory job for 59 years.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:14.240
When I got this assignment, I had to be a factor of a seer with three years of experience.

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.040
I need a lot of help.

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.639
They were all very helpful to me.

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:20.439
There was nine departments of the factory.

00:04:20.439 --> 00:04:23.839
Every department had an overseer and everybody was years and 90.

00:04:23.839 --> 00:04:26.600
I go them and talk over matters, discuss things.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.040
Different had different abilities and different fields.

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.839
If it was something on the Bible, I'd go to Brother Carl Klein.

00:04:31.839 --> 00:04:34.160
He was the sharpest biblical.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.120
And others, different matters.

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.279
And that's what pulled me through.

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:40.600
I get to appreciate the depth of the anointed part of that.

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.959
None of them resented the fact that I got the job all of them in a Beth longer years.

00:04:44.959 --> 00:04:46.639
And they're very devoted.

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.720
We had what we call janitors back there, they call them cleaners.

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.040
These two handled a factory for about 50 years,

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:58.160
doing all the janitor work to the anointed.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.360
And they just treasure that's what everybody say had.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:06.420
They just show their spirit they had to the anointed people.

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:10.019
All of us said there's no place on earth.

00:05:10.019 --> 00:05:12.139
That equals being a Bethel, of course.

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:13.500
So I had that feeling.

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.740
They're one savassing what helped the states the laws,

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.420
they never thought of anything else.

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:21.459
We've had a good companion, a very intelligent,

00:05:21.459 --> 00:05:27.420
a spiritual mind, a wife, a very devoted.

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:33.319
And it's been a great encouragement to the two to help me state Bethel.

00:05:33.319 --> 00:05:37.160
Also those years, operating the factory constantly

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.439
and I appreciate it as a host of rights.

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:41.959
And I knew it's going to come out the way intended to.

00:05:41.959 --> 00:05:44.680
To see that organization may build up.

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.720
We're fulfilling what we've prayed for.

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:50.720
For God's came to the comber who will be done on earth that doesn't happen.

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:54.399
We live without sickness, without illness, perfection of health,

00:05:54.399 --> 00:05:57.639
peaceful conditions on earth, a paradise condition.

00:05:57.639 --> 00:06:00.040
There's what our loving father has for us.

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:01.800
And that's the hope we have.

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.279
And that's what we strive for.

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:07.240
So be faithful to the hope of God to help other people learn about this.

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:10.839
We can take a great crowd with us through this tribulation.

00:06:10.839 --> 00:06:14.040
Enjoy eternal life on a paradise earth,

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:17.199
on a loving rule of a heavenly government kingdom.
