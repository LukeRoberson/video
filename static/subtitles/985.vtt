00:00:01.229 --> 00:00:05.230
Chahoa intended married couples to work together.

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:11.230
That's why Jesus used the expression we find at Matthew 19 and verse 6.

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:17.230
Let's read this from the Bible, Matthew 19, I'll give you a moment,

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:24.640
Matthew chapter 19, and we're going to read verse 6.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:30.640
Now, first of all, Jesus quotes from Genesis 2.24.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:36.640
He says, speaking of varied couples, he says, so that they are no longer two, but one flesh.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.640
Now, you remember Chahoa made that comment in the Garden of Eden.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.640
But now, Jesus adds something that isn't in Genesis.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:56.640
He says, therefore, what God has yoked together, let no man put apart.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:04.640
When we think of a yoke, we may think of a team of horses plowing a field or pulling a heavy wagon.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.640
Now, if they pull together, they can be a powerful force.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.049
The same is true when family members work together.

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:22.049
Mom, dad, you have excellent reasons to work together.

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.049
When you work together, you contribute to the peace of the family.

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:29.049
And think of the effect it has on the children.

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:35.049
By working together, you are teaching that fine young son of yours how to be a caring husband and father,

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:41.049
and your beautiful daughter, how to be a supportive wife and mother.

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:47.049
But what happens when teammates begin pulling in opposite directions or when one puts on the brakes?

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:49.049
Let's watch a video.

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.049
Now, here's the setup.

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:58.049
For a long time, a sister raised her two children as a single parent and she did a great job of it.

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:04.049
Then, she married a very kind brother. The family has a new head.

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.050
Let's see how well the sister is adapting to her new role.

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:18.110
The last few weeks of family worship have been nice. Right?

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.110
Yeah.

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.110
All these things we ask in praying, Jesus' name, amen.

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:30.539
Okay, this week.

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:32.539
We are in chapter 5.

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:36.539
Yeah, that's right. And last week gave bread, so this week...

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:38.539
It's suster.

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:42.099
That's right, it's suster.

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:45.099
Okay, the point here is that when it comes...

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:49.099
Honey, maybe an illustration would be better.

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:51.099
Um...

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:53.099
Okay.

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:55.099
It's like a bird.

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:58.099
Well, hopefully I was able to clear that up for you a little bit of Olivia.

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:59.099
Thank you.

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:01.099
Well, actually, Max, that's not true.

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:06.900
We had an updated understanding in the recent watchtower.

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:07.900
Thanks.

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:15.379
I think they went really well.

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:18.379
Right?

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:20.379
Um...

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:24.939
Actually.

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:28.020
Hey.

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:31.020
Maybe we can talk about it later.

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:47.379
Okay.

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:49.379
The sister isn't a bad person.

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:54.379
But we can ask, what's she teaching her daughter about the wife's role in the family?

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:58.379
And what's her son learning about taking the lead as the man of the house?

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:02.379
He hasn't had a man in his life for a long time.

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:04.379
No, there is one.

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:09.379
It's safe to say that the kids will stand a better chance of having a successful marriage themselves

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:13.379
when they see their parents pulling together.

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:17.379
A little later, we'll see how the husband handles the situation.

00:04:17.379 --> 00:04:20.379
And we, brothers, are going to want to pay attention.

00:04:20.379 --> 00:04:24.819
This is a classic.

00:04:24.819 --> 00:04:30.819
Family life is more pleasant when dad, mom, and the kids work together as a team.

00:04:30.819 --> 00:04:32.819
The family head is the captain.

00:04:32.819 --> 00:04:37.819
He needs to make sure that everyone knows what goal is the family's working toward,

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:41.819
and how each one can contribute toward achieving those goals.

00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:47.819
When it's your family's turn to help clean the kingdom hall, or a convention venue, for example,

00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:50.819
don't leave the kids at home. They're part of the team.

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:53.819
Don't go there with half the team.

00:04:53.819 --> 00:04:57.819
Let them experience the joy that comes from serving others.

00:04:57.819 --> 00:04:59.819
Let them work along with you.

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:03.819
If you're assigned to clean the restrooms, don't complain about it.

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:05.819
A very fine example.

00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:09.819
Her children will learn that, when there's work to be done, we just do it.

00:05:09.819 --> 00:05:14.819
We aren't picky about what we will and will not do.

00:05:14.819 --> 00:05:18.819
And we don't feel that some jobs are beneath us.

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:25.819
Now this is in line with Paul's counsel, found at Philippians chapter 2, verses 3 and 4.

00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:28.819
Let's look that up.

00:05:28.819 --> 00:05:30.819
Let's go to exercise.

00:05:30.819 --> 00:05:37.819
Philippians chapter 2, verses 3 and 4.

00:05:37.819 --> 00:05:40.819
Now we're thinking about the family as a team here.

00:05:40.819 --> 00:05:51.819
It says, do nothing out of contentiousness, or out of egotism, but with humility, consider others superior to you,

00:05:51.819 --> 00:05:59.819
as you will look out not only for your own interests, but also for the interests of others.

00:05:59.819 --> 00:06:02.819
When there's work to be done, someone has to do it.

00:06:02.819 --> 00:06:08.819
Do I think that I'm so special that someone else has to look after it?

00:06:08.819 --> 00:06:12.819
Some families volunteer to help with kingdom hall maintenance.

00:06:12.819 --> 00:06:16.819
When the kids are old enough, they can work on other projects like working on an assembly hall.

00:06:16.819 --> 00:06:18.819
They have a ball.

00:06:18.819 --> 00:06:23.819
The friendships that you and your young people will forge can last a lifetime.

00:06:23.819 --> 00:06:25.819
And here's a bonus.

00:06:25.819 --> 00:06:34.819
When the young people go to a circuit assembly or a regional convention, they'll have good friends to associate with, both young and old.

00:06:34.819 --> 00:06:36.819
People they've been working with.

00:06:36.819 --> 00:06:42.420
What about working around the house?

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:48.420
Some parents feel that the children shouldn't have to help out at all because they have their schoolwork to do.

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:51.420
But their schoolwork is something they do for themselves.

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:55.420
How are they contributing to the welfare of the family?

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:59.420
How are they learning to serve others unselfishly?

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:06.420
It's good for a child to feel that he has an important role in the household and that people are counting on him.

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:10.420
Think what that does for his self-respect.

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:12.420
A father named Stephen said,

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:17.420
When nothing is expected of them, children learn that they're here to be served.

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:24.420
And they grow up with a distorted view of what life will require of them.

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:30.420
We might ask, will a young person with that attitude even be able to keep a job?

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:36.420
When some of the world lose their job, they remain unemployed for a long time.

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:38.420
They can't pay the bills.

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:41.420
Yet there are job opportunities all around them.

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:44.420
But they consider those jobs beneath them.

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:49.420
And what's one of the most annoying traits an employee can have?

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:51.420
Ask any boss.

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:54.420
When the worker is asked to do something, he replies,

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:56.420
that's not my job.

00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:02.420
Teach your child that anything that needs to be done is his job

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:05.420
if he's old enough and capable of doing it.

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:10.670
How early should parents start to assign chores to their children?

00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:15.670
Some experts have found that children who are three years old

00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:19.670
or even younger can be taught to help out.

00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:24.670
They can learn to pick up their toys, clean up spills, sort laundry.

00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:29.670
Older children can vacuum, wash the car, prepare a meal.

00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:34.669
I'm happy to say that many young brothers here at Bethel are excellent cooks,

00:08:34.669 --> 00:08:39.669
which is often the result of fine parental training.

00:08:39.669 --> 00:08:44.669
Do you remember the video where Caleb is taught to clean his room and put away his toys?

00:08:44.669 --> 00:08:48.669
That video was a game changer for many children.

00:08:48.669 --> 00:08:51.669
They want to be just like Caleb.

00:08:51.669 --> 00:08:58.080
And now, when you enter their room, you can find the bed.

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:03.080
When problems arise, attack the problem, not each other.

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:07.080
It's not how can I win, but how can we win?

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:11.080
You'll see an excellent example of that in the follow-up video.

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:26.389
Let's watch.

00:09:26.389 --> 00:09:27.389
Want some tea?

00:09:27.389 --> 00:09:29.389
Sure.

00:09:31.389 --> 00:09:38.620
Hey, babe. You and me.

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:39.620
We're a team, right?

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:41.620
Yeah, of course.

00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:46.059
When I read this, I thought about us.

00:09:46.059 --> 00:09:56.460
So that they are no longer two, but one flesh.

00:09:56.460 --> 00:10:01.460
I know before you had to shoulder everything yourself for so long.

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:03.460
And you did great.

00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:10.029
You've been raising two beautiful, spiritual kids on your own.

00:10:10.029 --> 00:10:11.029
But now you have me.

00:10:11.029 --> 00:10:14.409
Yeah, I do.

00:10:14.409 --> 00:10:17.409
So, do you think sometimes we're not a team?

00:10:17.409 --> 00:10:20.409
Well, it's just sometimes our family worship.

00:10:20.409 --> 00:10:22.409
I get excited and I jump in.

00:10:22.409 --> 00:10:27.409
I know I'm just so used to doing it after all these years.

00:10:27.409 --> 00:10:30.409
I know you're not trying to take over and listen.

00:10:30.409 --> 00:10:31.409
I love the way you teach.

00:10:31.409 --> 00:10:36.409
I see how you can reach the kids in ways that I can't.

00:10:36.409 --> 00:10:38.409
Just let me guide it.

00:10:38.409 --> 00:10:41.409
And I'll make sure you can do that.

00:10:41.409 --> 00:10:42.409
Thanks, honey.

00:10:42.409 --> 00:10:44.409
Thanks for your patience.

00:10:44.409 --> 00:10:46.409
No, thank you for your patience.

00:10:46.409 --> 00:10:53.039
I'm a work in progress, but we make a great team.

00:10:53.039 --> 00:10:57.039
Why don't we look at what we're going to cover before our next family worship?

00:10:57.039 --> 00:10:58.039
That sounds great.

00:10:58.039 --> 00:11:07.289
Wasn't that a fine example of how to attack a problem?

00:11:07.289 --> 00:11:09.289
Not your mate.

00:11:09.289 --> 00:11:10.289
No arguments.

00:11:10.289 --> 00:11:12.289
No raised voices.

00:11:12.289 --> 00:11:14.289
No accusations.

00:11:14.289 --> 00:11:17.289
The husband had empathy for his wife.

00:11:17.289 --> 00:11:19.289
He didn't question her motives.

00:11:19.289 --> 00:11:24.289
He realized that as a single parent, she'd been taking the lead for a long time.

00:11:24.289 --> 00:11:29.289
And notice how she responded to her husband's kind counsel.

00:11:29.289 --> 00:11:33.289
No doubt, it's going to be easy for the kids to respect their stepfather.

00:11:33.289 --> 00:11:38.289
And they're going to learn how a husband and wife should treat each other

00:11:38.289 --> 00:11:40.289
and how they should pull together.

00:11:40.289 --> 00:11:46.600
Sometimes soon, you might want to consider these questions.

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:50.600
In what aspects of our marriage do we work well as a team?

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:54.600
And then how can we improve?

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:59.600
It pleases Jehovah when family members work together as a team.

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:02.600
That promotes peace in the family.

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:06.600
And our God is a God of peace.

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:14.009
Now, Brother John Echron will consider the final talk of this symposium.

00:12:14.009 --> 00:12:17.009
Follow the road map to family peace.

00:12:17.009 --> 00:12:20.009
Worship Jehovah together.
