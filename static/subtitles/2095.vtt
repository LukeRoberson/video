00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:06.960
A small seaside town in the south of Russia. This is the location where at the start of the 21st

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.960
century a war has been declared on non-conformity. The criminal case has been initiated against

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:20.000
17 individuals who professed the religion of Jehovah's Witnesses. It all began back in 2009 when a

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.359
local court pronounced extremists a number of publications published by Jehovah's Witnesses

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:30.239
for supposedly advocating the exclusivity of their religion. The court also ruled to

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:34.240
liquidate the registered community of Jehovah's Witnesses in Teginrog.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:54.240
Alexander Squartzov is among the many local witnesses who have had charges brought against them.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:01.280
In August of 2010 he became a victim of searches conducted simultaneously in 19 homes of the

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:12.959
worshippers. The rights of the worshippers have also been violated in that they have been forced

00:01:12.959 --> 00:01:18.480
to sign a promise not to leave their towns of residence. Kirill Kravchenko, a local Jehovah's

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:24.959
Witness, is a musician and member of a chamber choir. He was charged in band from leaving town soon

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:31.519
after he got married. Nikolai Trotsyuk is a Jehovah's Witness elder. He is one of the main suspects in

00:01:31.519 --> 00:01:36.560
the case. Nelly, all of his family members have been charged on the basis of their religion.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:55.680
Alexander Goncherova, Nikolai's daughter and mother of nine-year-old Snowjana, is also a suspect in

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.599
the case. These events remind her of the Soviet past.

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:25.280
In the 1990s, Jehovah's Witnesses were exonerated as innocent victims of repression,

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.719
but now they are once again being persecuted on the basis of invented charges. The allegations

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:36.479
put forward against them in Teginrog are absolutely identical to those featured in another major

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:41.520
case of the last decade, the liquidation of the Moscow community of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:02:48.479 --> 00:03:11.840
Another consequence of the prosecution's actions was the confiscation of the local kingdom hall.

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:32.479
This is the first time that such wide-scale ideological persecution of Jehovah's Witnesses has been

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:37.680
launched in modern-day Russia. The worshipers still hope that the Russian state will protect the

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:44.159
rights of its citizens to the fundamental freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution and under international

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:56.639
law, including the European Convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms.
