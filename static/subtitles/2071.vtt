00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.599
I was at a kind of crossroads in my life.

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:09.199
Should I go to Bethel for one month and lose the job?

00:00:09.199 --> 00:00:11.400
We had to make a hard decision.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.800
It was related to neutrality issue.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.800
Should I keep my thought after and well-paying job or quit

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.800
so that I can focus on my pioneer?

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.800
I had to make a decision to go to university

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.199
or to serve Jehovah full-time.

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:30.000
The crossroads really was the attitude toward the decision.

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:33.600
The foundation of good decision is absolutely

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.799
study the Bible and meditation.

00:00:35.799 --> 00:00:37.600
I talked to Jehovah and pray,

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.799
and they will have never done before in my life.

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:45.600
We would always stop and think and meditate on what the scripture says.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.799
She just says, keep your eyes simple.

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:52.000
Trust in Jehovah and do not lean upon your own understanding.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
We should be content with sustenance and covering.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.399
Think about Jehovah.

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.000
But Jehovah was a student.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.600
When all our daily decisions come together,

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:07.599
we can build a bridge between our life and our long-term spiritual goal.

00:01:07.599 --> 00:01:10.799
Truly speaking, Jehovah's way is happy.

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.799
Whenever I make him happy,

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:14.000
that makes me happy too.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.400
So if we planted Jehovah,

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.000
it will surely be successful.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.400
We were very happy for taking that decision.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.400
And Jehovah really blessed us for that.

00:01:25.599 --> 00:01:27.599
Look at where are we today?

00:01:27.599 --> 00:01:31.489
We are turning here.

00:01:31.489 --> 00:01:35.290
The graduation of the 136th Class of Gilead

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.890
on Saturday, March 8, 2014,

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:45.599
reaffirmed the rightness of decisions made in harmony with Jehovah's will.

00:01:45.599 --> 00:01:48.599
Chairman David Splein of the governing body

00:01:48.599 --> 00:01:51.599
opened the program with the discussion of the importance

00:01:51.599 --> 00:01:54.599
of adopting Jesus' mental attitude.

00:01:54.599 --> 00:01:59.599
Jehovah loves humble, modest people.

00:01:59.599 --> 00:02:01.599
Do you want Jehovah to love you?

00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:03.599
Then be humble and modest.

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:07.599
In the talk, sacrifice without regret,

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:10.199
William Mallenfant, a teaching committee helper,

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:14.599
highlighted the value of considering Jehovah's will in life's decisions.

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:17.199
If you would not have accepted the truth,

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:22.199
you would do this day be hopeless and unhappy.

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:25.199
But because of the truth, it's quite the contrary.

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:28.199
We belong to Jehovah because we've made the decision

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:32.199
of our own free will to give ourselves to God.

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:34.199
Sighting field service experiences

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:36.199
indicating angelic direction.

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:38.199
Garrett Loesch of the governing body

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:40.199
entreated the students to continue yielding

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:43.199
to the influence of the angels.

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:45.199
Ask them, how did you get in?

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:47.199
The sister told him she said the prayer

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:49.199
and punched four buttons.

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:52.199
And we don't forget that angels are directing

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:54.199
the worldwide preaching work.

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:57.199
In developing the theme, the honorable one

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:59.199
will be blessed.

00:02:59.199 --> 00:03:01.199
Gilead instructor Michael Burnett focused

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:04.199
on the graduate's goal in their assignments.

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:07.199
The reason you came to Gilead and the purpose of Gilead

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:10.199
is to stabilize and strengthen the field

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:12.199
and branch organization.

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:15.199
So will you have interest in the disciple making work?

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:17.199
And will you do everything you can

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:20.199
to strengthen the organization?

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:24.199
Hello, Gilead instructor Mark Numer put into perspective

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:27.199
each Christian's personal responsibility

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:30.199
to keep your fire burning.

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:34.199
God's Holy Spirit ignites a fiery enthusiasm

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:36.199
and a love for the truth within you.

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:39.199
But you must keep that love for God alive.

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:41.199
So that fire does not go out.

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:45.199
That's your responsibility to keep yourselves in God's love.

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:48.199
He cited scriptural examples of humility.

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:50.199
Barnabas Joy came from encouraging others

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:52.199
and seeing Jehovah use them.

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:54.199
And he understood that to move ahead

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:58.199
with God's organization meant advancing to the rear.

00:03:58.199 --> 00:04:00.199
In order to push kingdom interest forward.

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:03.199
Theocratic schools instructor Samuel Robertson

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:06.199
directed reenactments of some of the students'

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:09.199
actual field service experiences.

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:11.199
Please, we want to see it.

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:13.199
As I read, please note what the Bible says

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:15.199
who happens to sickness, right?

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:17.199
Thank you by waving to us.

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:19.199
Oh, I remember you now.

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:22.199
It's at jw.org and it's translated also in your language.

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:24.199
And you see here, you can have a lot of questions.

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:26.199
In an interview conducted by Donald Gordon,

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:28.199
a publishing committee helper.

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:32.199
Two of the graduating couples revisited the subject of decisions.

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:36.199
Under the theme, grow mightier through divine education.

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:39.199
This has really encouraged me to humbly accept

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:41.199
whatever assignment is given me.

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:43.199
And like that good slave in the illustration,

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:46.199
I will be happy and content knowing that I am doing

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:48.199
what Jehovah has asked me to do.

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:52.199
I'm determined to make sure I approach every day's situation,

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:55.199
seeing things Jehovah's way.

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:59.060
Mark Sanderson of the governing body

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:02.060
provided parting exhortation in the talk.

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:05.060
May Jehovah remember you favorably.

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:09.060
We are never content with simply having a token share

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:12.060
in the ministry or doing just the least

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.060
in whatever assignment we're given.

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:19.060
But we do everything to demonstrate our godly devotion

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.060
by doing our utmost in Jehovah's service.

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:27.060
Let your love be the motivating force behind everything that you do

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:31.060
and you too will be remembered favorably.

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:38.970
Finally, the 136th Class of Gilead had opportunity

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:41.970
to express collectively their determination

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:45.970
to use the gift of divine education.

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:48.970
Now we are resolved to use our training

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:51.970
to stabilize and strengthen our brothers

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:54.970
and above all, to bring glory and honor

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:57.970
to our grand instructor, Jehovah.

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:02.970
The brothers and sisters of the 136th Class of Gilead.
