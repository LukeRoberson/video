00:00:01.419 --> 00:00:04.419
Imagine for a moment that you're going on a trip.

00:00:05.419 --> 00:00:07.419
The tickets are a gift.

00:00:07.419 --> 00:00:09.419
A friend has paid the price.

00:00:09.419 --> 00:00:13.419
All you have to do is pack your bags and get to the airport.

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:17.420
Now, as you know, packing isn't easy.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.420
And dragging heavy bags around the airport is exhausting.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.420
Remember the days before luggage had wheels?

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.420
How did we do that?

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.420
Heavy baggage can make even a vacation seem like a burden.

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:34.420
Well, the point is this.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:40.420
You and I have set out on an exciting journey, a journey to God's new world.

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.420
The trip is free.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.420
The ransom paid the price.

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.420
All we have to do is get there.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.420
And that's the hard part, right?

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.420
And why?

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:58.420
Because each one of us is carrying some type of heavy baggage on this journey.

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.420
Now, it's true our life is blessed.

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.420
As Isaiah 65-13 says, figuratively,

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:09.420
we're eating and drinking while the world goes hungry and thirsty.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:16.420
Still, Acts 14-22 says we must enter the kingdom of God through many tribulations.

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.420
We have anxieties.

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:25.420
And Proverbs 12-25 says, anxiety in the heart can weigh it down.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:33.420
The heavy baggage we carry can make even the journey to God's new world seem like a burden.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.420
Well, the good news is we have help.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:42.420
Open your Bible to 1 Kings 8 verses 38 and 39.

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.420
Here Solomon prayed on behalf of Jehovah's people at the inauguration of the temple.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:54.420
And what he said in that prayer can help us put wheels on our baggage so it's easier for us to carry.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.420
At 1 Kings 8, beginning with verse 38,

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.420
Solomon says to Jehovah,

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:08.419
whatever prayer, whatever request for favor may be made by any man or by all your people Israel.

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:12.419
For each one knows the plague of his own heart.

00:02:12.419 --> 00:02:15.419
When they spread out their hands toward this house,

00:02:15.419 --> 00:02:18.419
then may you hear from the heavens your dwelling place.

00:02:18.419 --> 00:02:21.419
And may you forgive and take action.

00:02:22.419 --> 00:02:24.419
Now let's stop there.

00:02:24.419 --> 00:02:29.419
Notice that phrase, each one knows the plague of his own heart.

00:02:29.419 --> 00:02:34.419
In stating that, Solomon wasn't referring to the nation as a whole.

00:02:34.419 --> 00:02:37.419
He was referring to private suffering.

00:02:37.419 --> 00:02:41.419
The baggage each person had to carry.

00:02:41.419 --> 00:02:45.419
The problems no one else might know about.

00:02:45.419 --> 00:02:49.419
And although Solomon evidently had a specific type of plague in mind,

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:56.419
one that required forgiveness, by extension his words can apply to any anxiety that weighs us down.

00:02:56.419 --> 00:03:00.419
For example, chapter 2 of the God's love book,

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:05.419
applies Solomon's words to a personal weakness we might struggle with.

00:03:05.419 --> 00:03:12.419
The May 1st, 2010 watchtower applies it to the grief a person feels after losing a mate.

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:23.659
The point is, any anxiety that weighs us down can be considered a plague of the heart.

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:26.659
What is the plague of your heart?

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:33.659
What anxiety weighs you down on your journey to God's new world?

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:39.659
Whatever baggage we carry, the scripture we just read confirms that we have help.

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:43.659
Notice Solomon prayed that Jehovah would not only hear from the heavens,

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:51.659
but also take action if not to eliminate our load than at least to help us carry it.

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:55.659
For the rest of this discussion, we'll see how Jehovah can do that.

00:03:55.659 --> 00:04:00.659
In three situations, one, when circumstances discourage us.

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:04.659
Two, when people upset us.

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:09.659
And three, when negative emotions overwhelm us.

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:15.659
In all situations, Jehovah can help us cope with the plague of our heart.

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:16.660
Let's see how.

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.660
First, when circumstances discourage us.

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:26.389
Now, when it comes to circumstances, life is unpredictable.

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:36.389
And this system, things can change just like that with one phone call, one accident, one diagnosis.

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:42.389
Let me tell you about Annie, who was diagnosed at age 19 with pulmonary fibrosis.

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:46.389
And at first, she felt this was completely unfair.

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:50.389
Annie says pulmonary fibrosis affects heavy smokers.

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:54.389
And I had never had a cigarette in my life.

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:57.389
I was depressed. I wouldn't eat.

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:00.389
And I wouldn't talk to people.

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:05.389
I would just lie in bed and think about how miserable my life was.

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:08.389
Now, Annie is one of Jehovah's witnesses.

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:11.389
And she was one when she got sick.

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:15.389
She understood the real cause of her illness.

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:18.389
And she knew about the new world.

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:22.389
Still, this discouraging circumstance threw Annie off course.

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:26.389
She says, I prayed and prayed and prayed about it.

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:30.389
But it felt like I was just talking to the wall.

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:34.389
Now, regardless of our age, we may relate to Annie's comment.

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:41.389
When any of us face a discouraging circumstance, we pray about it repeatedly.

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:49.389
And if nothing changes, we may wonder whether Jehovah cares about or even sees what we're going through.

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:54.389
A discouraging circumstance can become a plague of our heart.

00:05:54.389 --> 00:05:56.389
How can we cope with it?

00:05:56.389 --> 00:06:01.389
Well, let's look at 2 Corinthians 12 verses 7 through 9.

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:06.389
Here the Apostle Paul faced a discouraging circumstance.

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:08.389
One that he calls a thorn in the flesh.

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:11.389
Now, as you realize, we don't know what that thorn was.

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:13.389
It might have been a physical affliction.

00:06:13.389 --> 00:06:17.389
Whatever it was, as we read these verses, try to detect two things.

00:06:17.389 --> 00:06:20.389
One, what Paul could not control.

00:06:20.389 --> 00:06:23.389
And two, what he could control.

00:06:23.389 --> 00:06:27.389
Second Corinthians 12, beginning with verse 7.

00:06:28.389 --> 00:06:31.389
To keep me from becoming overly exalted.

00:06:31.389 --> 00:06:40.389
I was given a thorn in the flesh, an angel of Satan, to keep slapping me so that I might not be overly exalted.

00:06:40.389 --> 00:06:45.389
Three times I begged the Lord about this that it would depart from me.

00:06:45.389 --> 00:06:53.389
But he said to me, my undeserved kindness is sufficient for you, for my power is being made perfect in weakness.

00:06:53.389 --> 00:06:57.389
Now, let's stop there and look at our two components.

00:06:57.389 --> 00:07:00.389
First, what couldn't Paul control?

00:07:00.389 --> 00:07:02.389
Well, the answer is obvious.

00:07:02.389 --> 00:07:10.389
The circumstance itself, his thorn in the flesh, Paul even prayed about it three times, but nothing changed.

00:07:10.389 --> 00:07:15.389
The circumstance was beyond his control.

00:07:15.389 --> 00:07:17.389
What could Paul control?

00:07:17.389 --> 00:07:19.389
His response.

00:07:19.389 --> 00:07:24.389
And part of that response was to accept the reality of a situation.

00:07:24.389 --> 00:07:30.389
To the point that he says in verse 9, most gladly, I will boast about my weaknesses.

00:07:30.389 --> 00:07:44.389
Once Paul realized that his thorn would not be removed, he didn't waste time doubting God's love or asking why me or comparing himself to others who seem to have an easier life.

00:07:44.389 --> 00:07:48.389
No, Paul accepted reality.

00:07:48.389 --> 00:07:54.389
He viewed his thorn as an angel of Satan, and he got about the business of endurance.

00:07:54.389 --> 00:07:59.389
Now, Paul's experience gives us a key to coping with any discouraging circumstance.

00:07:59.389 --> 00:08:02.389
First, break it down into two components.

00:08:02.389 --> 00:08:08.389
One, what we can't control, and two, what we can.

00:08:08.389 --> 00:08:13.389
And often, like Paul, what we can control is our response.

00:08:13.389 --> 00:08:16.389
That is a choice.

00:08:16.389 --> 00:08:26.389
When we face a discouraging circumstance, we could choose to become bitter about life, angry at God.

00:08:26.389 --> 00:08:30.389
We could even let it stumble us, some have.

00:08:30.389 --> 00:08:33.389
Or we could choose a better response.

00:08:33.389 --> 00:08:41.389
Like Paul, a better response usually involves first accepting the reality of the situation.

00:08:41.389 --> 00:08:48.389
Now, at first that might sound cold, but accepting reality is vital.

00:08:48.389 --> 00:08:49.389
Why?

00:08:49.389 --> 00:08:54.389
Page 7 of the April 2014 awake says this.

00:08:54.389 --> 00:09:02.389
By learning to accept what you cannot change, you are more likely to look for ways to cope with the situation.

00:09:02.389 --> 00:09:09.389
You start to take a measure of control of what seems to be an uncontrollable situation.

00:09:09.389 --> 00:09:12.389
Now, Harold King is an example of that.

00:09:12.389 --> 00:09:19.389
As you know, he was imprisoned for his faith, confined to a four and a half by nine-foot cell,

00:09:19.389 --> 00:09:23.389
Brother King certainly couldn't control his circumstance.

00:09:23.389 --> 00:09:26.389
But he could control his response.

00:09:26.389 --> 00:09:32.389
Once Brother King accepted the reality of his situation, he thought of things that he could control.

00:09:32.389 --> 00:09:37.389
Things that even prison walls could not prevent him from doing.

00:09:37.389 --> 00:09:39.389
For example, he prayed.

00:09:39.389 --> 00:09:41.389
He memorized scriptures.

00:09:41.389 --> 00:09:43.389
He wrote kingdom songs.

00:09:43.389 --> 00:09:47.389
He celebrated the memorial right there in his cell alone.

00:09:47.389 --> 00:09:52.389
He even went out in service by creating imaginary householders.

00:09:53.389 --> 00:10:04.389
Once Brother King accepted reality, he was able to take a measure of control of what seemed to be an uncontrollable situation.

00:10:04.389 --> 00:10:09.389
Now, a brother whose wife was diagnosed with cancer relates how they did something similar.

00:10:09.389 --> 00:10:15.389
They couldn't control the disease, but what could they do?

00:10:15.389 --> 00:10:18.389
Quoted in the August 2011 awake.

00:10:18.389 --> 00:10:26.389
The husband says, we decided that at regular intervals, we would not talk about the cancer for a whole day.

00:10:26.389 --> 00:10:29.389
Instead, we focused on the positive aspects of our life.

00:10:29.389 --> 00:10:33.389
It was like taking a vacation from the disease.

00:10:33.389 --> 00:10:37.389
Regularly, we had a cancer-free day.

00:10:37.389 --> 00:10:40.389
Now, that's how this couple took a measure of control.

00:10:40.389 --> 00:10:45.389
Others might choose a different method, but again, the point is this.

00:10:45.389 --> 00:10:55.389
Once we accept reality, we're more likely to find ways to cope with the situation and to even take a measure of control over it.

00:10:55.389 --> 00:11:00.470
But as accepting reality, all we can do.

00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:03.470
No, there's something more.

00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:11.470
The article learning to live with the unchangeable in the March 15th, 1978 watchtower suggests this.

00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:15.470
In whatever state or condition you might find yourself.

00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:20.470
Look for its compensations or mercies.

00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:24.470
That's exactly what Paul did in connection with his thorn.

00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:28.470
For example, look back at 2 Corinthians 12.

00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:34.470
In verse 7, twice Paul says that his thorn kept him from becoming overly exalted.

00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:37.470
Humility. That's one compensation.

00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:42.470
In verse 9, Paul says God's power is made perfect in weakness.

00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:45.470
Increased reliance on Jehovah.

00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:48.470
That's a second compensation.

00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:52.470
Here's a third. Let's look at Philippians 4.11.

00:11:52.470 --> 00:12:00.470
Now, Philippians was written about five or six years after Paul wrote to the Corinthians about his thorn in the flesh.

00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:08.470
So that thorn may have been one of the things on Paul's mind as he wrote what we're about to read.

00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:13.470
Philippians 4.11, second part of the verse.

00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:24.470
Paul says, I have learned to be self-sufficient or, according to the footnote, content regardless of my circumstances.

00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:37.470
Now, with these words, Paul expresses a vital truth that contentment, even happiness, does not depend on having ideal circumstances.

00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:40.470
You know, sometimes we talk as if it does.

00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:47.470
We say things like, I'll be happy when I get a better work assignment or I'll be happy when I get married.

00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:50.470
I'll be happy when I get a better room.

00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:53.470
I'll be happy when I get a better roommate.

00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:59.470
The idea is, I'll only be happy when my circumstances change.

00:12:59.470 --> 00:13:04.470
It's been said that people who think that way, strive and strive, but never arrive.

00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:13.820
Because as soon as they get that circumstance that was supposed to make them happy, another obstacle looms up and their discontent again.

00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:18.820
Paul chose to be content despite his circumstances.

00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:22.820
And notice he says in verse 11, I have learned this.

00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:26.820
Contentment might not have been his default position.

00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:35.820
Perhaps like many of us, Paul had a tendency to veer towards negativity when confronted with a trial.

00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:44.820
But Paul learned to be content, even when his repeated prayers for relief were not answered the way he would have liked.

00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:47.820
In fact, we could summarize the lesson, Paul learned this way.

00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:56.820
Don't let the blessing you're praying for blind you to the compensations and mercies you have.

00:13:56.820 --> 00:14:05.820
You know, sometimes when we're going through a trial, we tend to narrow the focus of our prayers by in effect telling Jehovah how we expect to be blessed.

00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:13.820
And yet, Jehovah may already be giving us compensations and mercies that we haven't considered.

00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:18.820
That's what Annie, the sister with pulmonary fibrosis, came to learn.

00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:25.820
Remember how she said, I prayed and prayed and prayed, but it felt like I was just talking to the wall.

00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:33.820
Annie also admits, at first I was even mad at Jehovah for not helping me in the way I wanted to be helped.

00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:40.820
How did Annie come to see compensations and mercies even in the midst of a serious illness?

00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:45.820
Here's what she says, my dad opened my eyes.

00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:54.820
While I was so upset at Jehovah, my dad wouldn't stop praying to him and thanking him and talking about how good Jehovah had been to me.

00:14:54.820 --> 00:15:01.820
I had just been through the worst months of my life and my dad was thanking Jehovah for what I asked him.

00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:09.820
He told me, you have no idea how expensive your medicine was and I wasn't even working.

00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:13.820
Somehow we managed to get everything we needed.

00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:15.820
There was always food in the house.

00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:18.820
Brothers kept coming to make sure we were eating.

00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:23.820
Jehovah gave us the strength to keep going and not give up.

00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:30.820
And then Annie's dad told her this, just because Jehovah didn't help you the way you wanted to be helped,

00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:33.820
doesn't mean he didn't do it.

00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:43.820
In essence, her dad was saying, don't let the blessing you're praying for blind you to the compensations and mercies you have.

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:51.820
Annie now says, Jehovah helps us in ways we can't see it first because we're so overwhelmed by what we're going through.

00:15:51.820 --> 00:16:00.820
But I've learned that Jehovah has a way of doing things and his way is always better than my way.

00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:03.820
We can adopt a similar viewpoint.

00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:13.820
If we can see the compensations and mercies in our situation, then we'll be better able to cope with a circumstance that has become a plague of our heart.

00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:23.059
So to review, how can the Apostle Paul's example lighten our load when a discouraging circumstance is weighing us down?

00:16:23.059 --> 00:16:31.059
First, accept the reality of the situation that may open our minds to practical ways to deal with it.

00:16:31.059 --> 00:16:40.059
Second, look for compensations and mercies. Don't let the blessing you're praying for blind you to the blessings you have.

00:16:40.059 --> 00:16:50.720
Those two suggestions can help us cope with a discouraging circumstance that has become a plague of our heart.

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:58.419
Now let's move on to our second point of when people upset us.

00:16:58.419 --> 00:17:06.420
The minister will call Helen has been pioneering for six years. She serves as a construction volunteer.

00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:11.420
She helped out for an extended period on the warwick project.

00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:19.420
Needless to say, Helen has been around a lot of people and Jehovah's people and that's a blessing.

00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:24.420
But Helen admits that at times it's also been a test. Why?

00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:29.420
She says, one of my greatest weaknesses is a critical eye toward others.

00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:33.420
Rarely do I have a good first impression of a person.

00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:36.420
It's always tainted by some negative observation.

00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:43.420
At first, even the best of people seem too quick to laugh, too popular, even too spiritual.

00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:47.420
It's a terrible, ugly weakness I have.

00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:50.420
Now, perhaps we can relate to Helen's comment.

00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:57.420
We might tend to get annoyed or even hold a grudge when someone says or does the wrong thing.

00:17:57.420 --> 00:18:01.420
And we think that tendency will change when we come to Bethel, right?

00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:04.420
Finally, I'll be around people who are easy to get along with.

00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:16.420
And then at some point, whether it's after a few months or a few minutes, the bubble bursts and now we're not sure whether the brotherhood is a blessing from Jehovah or a test from Satan.

00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:22.660
How can we cope with that when people upset us?

00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:24.660
Well, let's look at Romans 12-18.

00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:29.660
And as we read Romans 12-18, try to detect two things.

00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:36.660
Number one, what we can't control and number two, what we can control.

00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:46.660
Romans 12-18 says, if possible, as far as it depends on you, be peaceable with all men.

00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:49.660
Now, let's look at our two components.

00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:52.660
First, what can't we control?

00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:54.660
What others say or do?

00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:57.660
That part depends on them.

00:18:57.660 --> 00:19:00.660
What can we control?

00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:02.660
Again, it's our response.

00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:04.660
That is a choice.

00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:10.660
When someone upsets us, we can choose to let it grow or we can choose to let it go.

00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:13.660
We can choose to be peaceable with all men.

00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:20.660
That part, Romans 12-18 says, depends on each one of us.

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:25.660
So how can we choose to be peaceable when someone upsets us?

00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:27.660
Well, let's look at Judges 8-2.

00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:29.660
This shows us one thing we can do.

00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:36.660
Judges 8-2, here Gideon avoided what could have turned out to be a messy conflict.

00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:38.660
You remember the story.

00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:42.660
Gideon and his army had just won a battle against Midian.

00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:47.660
And at that point, the tribe of Ephraim starts complaining.

00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:50.660
Now, even though they were eventually called into the battle,

00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:54.660
and even though they captured two Midianite princes,

00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:58.660
the Ephraimites felt that they should have been called in sooner.

00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:00.660
And they blamed this all on Gideon.

00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:04.660
Judges 8-1 says they quarreled bitterly with him about this.

00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:06.660
So now there's a conflict.

00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:08.660
How did Gideon handle it?

00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:12.660
Notice what he says to the tribe of Ephraim at Judges 8-2.

00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:16.660
What have I done compared with you?

00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:21.660
Are not the gleanings of Ephraim better than the great harvest of Abbeezer?

00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:24.660
What does that last question mean?

00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:28.660
Well, Gideon was from the family of Abbeezer.

00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:32.660
So what he's saying to the Ephraimites is,

00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:36.660
the grapes that your tribe leaves behind

00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:40.660
are better than the best grapes my family can grow.

00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:44.660
And then he reminds the Ephraimites that they had an important role in the battle.

00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:46.660
And again, he asked them,

00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:48.660
what have I done compared with you?

00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:51.660
Verse 3 says after that,

00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:54.660
the Ephraimites calm down.

00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:55.660
Problem solved.

00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:56.660
And how?

00:20:56.660 --> 00:20:58.660
What did Gideon do here?

00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:01.660
In the face of a conflict with the Ephraimites,

00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:03.660
he did not put them down.

00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:04.660
He raised them up.

00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:06.660
He found something good about them.

00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:08.660
In this case, they're great harvest,

00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:12.660
something totally unrelated to the conflict.

00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:14.660
And for the sake of peace,

00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:17.660
he praised them for it.

00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:20.660
Now, we can take a similar approach.

00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:22.660
When someone upsets us,

00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:25.660
look for the great harvest.

00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:27.660
Even if it's just to ourselves,

00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:29.660
we can find something good about the person.

00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:33.660
Perhaps something totally unrelated to the conflict we're having.

00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:35.660
Now, that's what Helen,

00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:37.660
this is where I quoted earlier,

00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:39.660
is trying to do.

00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:40.660
She says,

00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:43.660
for every bad thought I have toward a person,

00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:47.660
I try to make myself find something good about them.

00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:49.660
When I take that step back,

00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:52.660
it's easier for me to get to know a person

00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:54.660
from a loving standpoint.

00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:57.660
We can do the same thing.

00:21:57.660 --> 00:21:58.660
When someone upsets us,

00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:00.660
take that step back.

00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:01.660
Look for the great harvest.

00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:03.660
Find the good in that person.

00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:05.660
That's the first thing we can do.

00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:07.660
Now, a second thing we can do

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:09.660
is identify the Galatians chapter 2.

00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:11.660
Let's look at that.

00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:13.660
And before we read from this chapter,

00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:16.660
Galatians 2, consider this question,

00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:20.660
who are we most likely to get upset at?

00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:24.660
Probably someone who wrongs us, wouldn't you think?

00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:26.660
But, you know, there's one type of person

00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:29.660
we might be even more prone to get upset at.

00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:31.660
You know who it is?

00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:33.660
Not someone who wrongs us,

00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:35.660
but someone who writes us

00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:38.660
by giving us correction when we need it.

00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:41.660
And, Galatians 2, we're going to see an example of that.

00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:43.660
Here, Peter was given correction,

00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:45.660
and he needed it.

00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:48.660
But notice how the correction was given.

00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:50.660
And then we'll see why, in this case,

00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:52.660
it might have been exceptionally hard

00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:54.660
for Peter to accept it.

00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:58.660
At Galatians chapter 2, verse 11,

00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:02.660
Paul writes, however, when Cephas,

00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:04.660
that's Peter, came to Antioch,

00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:06.660
I resisted him face to face

00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:09.660
because he was clearly in the wrong.

00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:12.660
Paul is upset at Peter, and why?

00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:14.660
In verse 12, he tells us,

00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:16.660
for before certain men from James arrived,

00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:18.660
those were Jewish Christians,

00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:21.660
Peter used to eat with people of the nations.

00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:23.660
But when they arrived, he stopped doing this

00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:24.660
and separated himself,

00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:27.660
fearing those of the circumcised class.

00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:30.660
And what's Paul saying here,

00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:32.660
that Peter would change how he acted,

00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:35.660
depending on who was watching.

00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:37.660
And Paul called him out on this.

00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:39.660
He says, I resisted Peter face to face.

00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:42.660
And then in verse 14, Paul really gives it to Peter.

00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:44.660
He tells him straight out, you act one way

00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:46.660
when the Jewish Christians are watching

00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:48.660
and another way when their backs are turned.

00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:52.660
In verse 13, Paul calls this a pretense,

00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:55.660
or as the footnote renders it,

00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:57.660
hypocrisy.

00:23:57.660 --> 00:24:02.660
Imagine, Paul is calling Peter a hypocrite.

00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:05.660
And he does this, not privately,

00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:07.660
but before them all, verse 14 says,

00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:09.660
can this get any worse?

00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:12.660
Yes. And it did.

00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:14.660
Under inspiration,

00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:16.660
Paul wrote about this incident

00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:18.660
in his letter to the Galatians,

00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:20.660
which we just read from.

00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:22.660
Now to make a comparison.

00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:27.660
Today, internet messages spread from one person to the next.

00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:32.660
And when a message circulates rapidly and widely,

00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:35.660
people say it went viral.

00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:38.660
And they didn't have the internet in the first century, of course.

00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:40.660
But they did have letters,

00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:43.660
and letters circulated.

00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:45.660
And this one, Galatians,

00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:48.660
did more than just circulate from one person to the next,

00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:50.660
or even one congregation to the next.

00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:52.660
No. Under Jehovah's Supervision,

00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:54.660
this one ended up in the Bible.

00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:56.660
Billions of copies down through the centuries,

00:24:56.660 --> 00:24:58.660
still being printed,

00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:00.660
translated into thousands of languages.

00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:02.660
Now the whole world can read about Peter's hypocrisy,

00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:04.660
as we just did.

00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:08.519
Now the Bible doesn't tell us,

00:25:08.519 --> 00:25:11.519
Peter's immediate reaction.

00:25:11.519 --> 00:25:14.519
Initially, he may have been upset at Paul for all we know.

00:25:14.519 --> 00:25:16.519
But in the end,

00:25:16.519 --> 00:25:18.519
Peter chose to be peaceable.

00:25:18.519 --> 00:25:20.519
How do we know that?

00:25:20.519 --> 00:25:22.519
Well, in his second letter,

00:25:22.519 --> 00:25:25.519
which was written about 12 to 14 years later,

00:25:25.519 --> 00:25:29.519
Peter called Paul our beloved brother.

00:25:29.519 --> 00:25:32.519
And he even said that Paul had God-given wisdom.

00:25:32.519 --> 00:25:35.519
That's his second Peter 3.15.

00:25:35.519 --> 00:25:37.519
So in the end,

00:25:37.519 --> 00:25:39.519
Peter looked up to Paul,

00:25:39.519 --> 00:25:40.519
and for good reason,

00:25:40.519 --> 00:25:41.519
as he acknowledged,

00:25:41.519 --> 00:25:44.519
Paul had God-given wisdom

00:25:44.519 --> 00:25:46.519
to see not only into Scripture,

00:25:46.519 --> 00:25:48.519
but also into people.

00:25:48.519 --> 00:25:51.519
He could even see into Peter.

00:25:51.519 --> 00:25:54.519
And instead of viewing that as a threat,

00:25:54.519 --> 00:25:57.519
Peter saw it as a benefit.

00:25:57.519 --> 00:26:01.519
And that's because he chose to be peaceable.

00:26:01.519 --> 00:26:03.519
Now you and I can do the same.

00:26:03.519 --> 00:26:05.519
In fact, we need to.

00:26:05.519 --> 00:26:07.519
Why?

00:26:07.519 --> 00:26:08.519
Because from time to time,

00:26:08.519 --> 00:26:11.519
each one of us will encounter a Paul.

00:26:11.519 --> 00:26:15.519
Someone who gives us correction that we need to hear.

00:26:15.519 --> 00:26:17.519
But it comes to us in blunt terms,

00:26:17.519 --> 00:26:19.519
perhaps at a most inappropriate time,

00:26:19.519 --> 00:26:21.519
and it stings.

00:26:21.519 --> 00:26:23.519
And sometimes the counsel that stings the most

00:26:23.519 --> 00:26:26.519
is also the counsel we need the most.

00:26:26.519 --> 00:26:29.519
If, like Peter, we choose to be peaceable,

00:26:29.519 --> 00:26:31.519
we'll be able to take it.

00:26:31.519 --> 00:26:33.519
Not only when someone wrongs us,

00:26:33.519 --> 00:26:35.519
but also when someone writes us

00:26:35.519 --> 00:26:39.519
by giving us needed correction.

00:26:39.519 --> 00:26:40.519
Let's be honest, though.

00:26:40.519 --> 00:26:42.519
It's tough to do that.

00:26:42.519 --> 00:26:45.519
We can be so hypersensitive at times.

00:26:45.519 --> 00:26:46.519
And no wonder.

00:26:46.519 --> 00:26:48.519
We live in a world where

00:26:48.519 --> 00:26:52.519
it's just common to blame someone else for our mistakes.

00:26:52.519 --> 00:26:54.519
If someone breaks something,

00:26:54.519 --> 00:26:56.519
it's the manufacturer's fault

00:26:56.519 --> 00:26:58.519
for not making it unbreakable.

00:26:58.519 --> 00:26:59.519
A speeding ticket?

00:26:59.519 --> 00:27:00.519
That's the policeman's fault

00:27:00.519 --> 00:27:02.519
because he had to meet a quota.

00:27:02.519 --> 00:27:04.519
If a child fails English,

00:27:04.519 --> 00:27:05.519
it's the teacher's fault

00:27:05.519 --> 00:27:07.519
for not teaching English good enough,

00:27:07.519 --> 00:27:09.519
or well enough.

00:27:09.519 --> 00:27:11.519
In this world,

00:27:11.519 --> 00:27:14.519
correction is largely viewed as an insult,

00:27:14.519 --> 00:27:16.519
not as a teaching tool.

00:27:16.519 --> 00:27:19.519
But God's Word does not support the world's view.

00:27:19.519 --> 00:27:21.519
The Bible tells us of people

00:27:21.519 --> 00:27:24.519
that stayed in or went out of God's favor,

00:27:24.519 --> 00:27:28.519
depending on how they responded to counsel.

00:27:28.519 --> 00:27:30.519
So if we choose to remain bitter

00:27:30.519 --> 00:27:32.519
at the person who corrected us,

00:27:32.519 --> 00:27:34.519
we need to remember this.

00:27:34.519 --> 00:27:36.519
We are letting our upset emotions

00:27:36.519 --> 00:27:40.519
have far too much power over us.

00:27:40.519 --> 00:27:42.519
Resentment is heavy baggage

00:27:42.519 --> 00:27:45.519
that will only add to our load

00:27:45.519 --> 00:27:47.519
on our journey to God's new world.

00:27:47.519 --> 00:27:49.519
And who needs that?

00:27:49.519 --> 00:27:53.519
Instead, we need to be peaceable.

00:27:53.519 --> 00:27:54.519
Not only when we're wronged,

00:27:54.519 --> 00:27:56.519
but also when we're righted

00:27:56.519 --> 00:27:59.519
through correction.

00:27:59.519 --> 00:28:00.519
So to review,

00:28:00.519 --> 00:28:02.519
how can we lighten our load

00:28:02.519 --> 00:28:03.519
when someone upsets us?

00:28:03.519 --> 00:28:05.519
First, like Gideon,

00:28:05.519 --> 00:28:07.519
look for the great harvest.

00:28:07.519 --> 00:28:10.519
Find something good about the person.

00:28:10.519 --> 00:28:12.519
Second, like Peter,

00:28:12.519 --> 00:28:14.519
be willing to accept correction

00:28:14.519 --> 00:28:17.519
regardless of the manner in which it's given.

00:28:17.519 --> 00:28:20.519
Those two suggestions can lighten our load

00:28:20.519 --> 00:28:23.519
when people upset us.

00:28:23.519 --> 00:28:28.410
Now let's move on to our third and final point,

00:28:28.410 --> 00:28:31.410
when negative emotions overwhelm us.

00:28:31.410 --> 00:28:34.910
As imperfect humans,

00:28:34.910 --> 00:28:39.910
we are prone to have a distorted view of ourselves.

00:28:39.910 --> 00:28:42.910
A few might think more of themselves

00:28:42.910 --> 00:28:46.910
than necessary as Romans 12-3 says.

00:28:46.910 --> 00:28:49.910
But others have the opposite problem,

00:28:49.910 --> 00:28:52.910
thinking too little of themselves,

00:28:52.910 --> 00:28:56.910
played with feelings of worthlessness.

00:28:56.910 --> 00:28:57.910
When they look at themselves,

00:28:57.910 --> 00:29:00.910
what they see is a gross

00:29:00.910 --> 00:29:02.910
misrepresentation of reality

00:29:02.910 --> 00:29:04.910
as if viewing themselves

00:29:04.910 --> 00:29:07.910
in a distorted, fun house mirror.

00:29:07.910 --> 00:29:09.910
For example, one witness quoted

00:29:09.910 --> 00:29:14.910
in the September 15, 2014 watchtower said this.

00:29:14.910 --> 00:29:17.910
When I think about everything I've done wrong,

00:29:17.910 --> 00:29:19.910
it can make me feel

00:29:19.910 --> 00:29:22.910
as if there's no way anyone can ever love me,

00:29:22.910 --> 00:29:24.910
not even Jehovah.

00:29:24.910 --> 00:29:28.910
Another quoted in the January 2006 awake said this,

00:29:28.910 --> 00:29:32.910
I knew that Jehovah had forgiven me from my mistakes,

00:29:32.910 --> 00:29:34.910
but I did not want him to.

00:29:34.910 --> 00:29:38.910
I wanted to suffer because I hated myself so much.

00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:41.910
While I knew that Jehovah could never have conceived

00:29:41.910 --> 00:29:44.910
of a place like Christendom's hell,

00:29:44.910 --> 00:29:48.910
I wanted him to invent one just for me.

00:29:48.910 --> 00:29:53.180
Now as these examples illustrate,

00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:57.180
our emotions, which ironically Jehovah created,

00:29:57.180 --> 00:30:00.180
to enhance our love and our worship,

00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:03.180
can sometimes turn against us

00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:06.180
and make us feel condemned.

00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:09.180
And that does more than just hinder our joy.

00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:11.180
It also hinders our ability

00:30:11.180 --> 00:30:13.180
to give Jehovah full glory

00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:16.180
for the magnitude of his love.

00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:20.180
So how can we cope with negative emotions

00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:22.180
that at times overwhelm us?

00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:27.180
Well, let's look at Romans 7, 22 to 25.

00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:31.180
Now here the Apostle Paul describes negative emotions

00:30:31.180 --> 00:30:33.180
that at times overwhelmed him.

00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:36.180
And as we read these verses, try to detect two things.

00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:39.180
One, what Paul could not control

00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:42.180
and two, what he could control.

00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:45.180
Romans 7 beginning with verse 22.

00:30:45.180 --> 00:30:48.180
I really delight in the law of God,

00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:51.180
according to the man I am within.

00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:53.180
But I see in my body another law

00:30:54.180 --> 00:30:56.180
warring against the law of my mind

00:30:56.180 --> 00:30:58.180
and leading me captive to sin's law

00:30:58.180 --> 00:31:00.180
that is in my body.

00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:02.180
Miserable man that I am.

00:31:02.180 --> 00:31:06.180
Who will rescue me from the body undergoing this death?

00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:12.009
Thanks to God through Jesus Christ, our Lord.

00:31:12.009 --> 00:31:14.009
Now let's identify our two components.

00:31:14.009 --> 00:31:17.009
First, what couldn't Paul control?

00:31:17.009 --> 00:31:20.009
Occasional feelings of self-doubt.

00:31:20.009 --> 00:31:23.009
Which Paul said made him feel miserable.

00:31:23.009 --> 00:31:25.009
What could he control?

00:31:25.009 --> 00:31:27.009
Once again, it's his response.

00:31:27.009 --> 00:31:30.009
And Paul's response is right there in verse 25.

00:31:30.009 --> 00:31:34.009
Thanks to God through Jesus Christ, our Lord.

00:31:34.009 --> 00:31:36.009
Here Paul gives us the first key

00:31:36.009 --> 00:31:39.009
to coping with negative emotions.

00:31:39.009 --> 00:31:42.009
Meditate on the ransom.

00:31:42.009 --> 00:31:45.009
Make it a personal study project if necessary.

00:31:45.009 --> 00:31:47.009
Collect scriptures from the Bible

00:31:47.009 --> 00:31:49.009
and material from our publications

00:31:49.009 --> 00:31:51.009
that build up appreciation

00:31:52.009 --> 00:31:54.009
for what Jesus' death means,

00:31:54.009 --> 00:31:57.009
not just to the world of mankind in general,

00:31:57.009 --> 00:32:01.009
but to each one of us as an individual.

00:32:01.009 --> 00:32:04.009
Meditating on the ransom can help us cope

00:32:04.009 --> 00:32:06.009
with negative emotions.

00:32:06.009 --> 00:32:08.009
And why?

00:32:08.009 --> 00:32:11.009
Because as the April 1st, 1995 watchtower says,

00:32:11.009 --> 00:32:12.009
and I quote,

00:32:12.009 --> 00:32:17.009
Christ's ransom sacrifice is the most potent answer

00:32:17.009 --> 00:32:22.009
to the satanic lie that we are worthless or unlovable.

00:32:22.009 --> 00:32:24.009
Let's think about that statement.

00:32:24.009 --> 00:32:28.009
Why does it call the idea that we are worthless or unlovable,

00:32:28.009 --> 00:32:33.009
not just a lie, but a satanic lie?

00:32:33.009 --> 00:32:36.009
Well, who really profits when we believe

00:32:36.009 --> 00:32:39.009
that we're unlovable to Jehovah?

00:32:39.009 --> 00:32:42.009
Who really benefits when we wallow

00:32:42.009 --> 00:32:45.009
in thoughts of self-condination?

00:32:45.009 --> 00:32:47.009
Whose purpose is really served

00:32:47.009 --> 00:32:49.009
when our emotions plague us

00:32:49.009 --> 00:32:52.009
to the extent that we feel like giving up?

00:32:52.009 --> 00:32:55.009
Obviously it's Satan.

00:32:55.009 --> 00:32:58.009
And consider the irony of that.

00:32:58.009 --> 00:33:03.009
Who really has proved himself unworthy of Jehovah's love?

00:33:03.009 --> 00:33:07.009
Him. Who really is beyond Jehovah's forgiveness?

00:33:07.009 --> 00:33:11.009
Him. Who really does the ransom not apply to?

00:33:11.009 --> 00:33:14.009
Him.

00:33:14.009 --> 00:33:16.009
And yet now,

00:33:16.009 --> 00:33:19.009
in one of his greatest crafty acts

00:33:19.009 --> 00:33:21.009
as Ephesians 6.11 calls it,

00:33:21.009 --> 00:33:25.009
Satan tries to throw all those feelings of condemnation

00:33:25.009 --> 00:33:31.119
that he deserves on you and on me.

00:33:31.119 --> 00:33:34.119
The ransom gives us permission

00:33:34.119 --> 00:33:37.119
to throw off that heavy baggage.

00:33:37.119 --> 00:33:40.119
Evidently, that's what Paul did.

00:33:40.119 --> 00:33:44.119
Yes, at times he felt miserable

00:33:44.119 --> 00:33:48.119
about himself as we read at Romans 7.24.

00:33:48.119 --> 00:33:50.119
But he also wrote at Galatians 2.20,

00:33:50.119 --> 00:33:54.119
I lived my faith in the Son of God who loved me

00:33:54.119 --> 00:33:57.119
and handed himself over for me.

00:33:57.119 --> 00:33:58.119
Now, in stating that,

00:33:58.119 --> 00:34:00.119
Paul wasn't being egotistical

00:34:00.119 --> 00:34:03.119
or thinking more of himself than necessary.

00:34:03.119 --> 00:34:06.119
He simply understood a basic scriptural truth

00:34:06.119 --> 00:34:09.119
that Christ died for sinners,

00:34:09.119 --> 00:34:11.119
not for perfect people.

00:34:11.119 --> 00:34:14.119
The fact that Paul was so keenly aware

00:34:14.119 --> 00:34:16.119
of his imperfections was evidence

00:34:16.119 --> 00:34:19.119
that he was the very kind of person

00:34:19.119 --> 00:34:22.119
that Jesus gave his life for.

00:34:22.119 --> 00:34:25.119
The ransom helped Paul refute

00:34:25.119 --> 00:34:27.119
any feelings of self-doubt

00:34:27.119 --> 00:34:29.119
and it can do the same for us.

00:34:29.119 --> 00:34:32.119
Again, the April 1st 1995 watchtower

00:34:32.119 --> 00:34:35.119
expresses that thought beautifully.

00:34:35.119 --> 00:34:37.119
It says, if life in this system

00:34:37.119 --> 00:34:39.119
has taught you to see yourself

00:34:39.119 --> 00:34:41.119
as an obstacle to daunting

00:34:41.119 --> 00:34:44.119
even for God's immense love to surmount

00:34:44.119 --> 00:34:47.119
or your sins is too vast

00:34:47.119 --> 00:34:50.119
even for the death of his precious son to cover.

00:34:50.119 --> 00:34:53.119
You have been taught a lie,

00:34:53.119 --> 00:34:56.119
reject such lies with all the repugnance

00:34:56.119 --> 00:34:58.119
that they deserve.

00:34:58.119 --> 00:35:01.119
Isn't that what we do with all of Satan's other lies?

00:35:01.119 --> 00:35:03.119
Do we accept the doctrine of the Trinity?

00:35:03.119 --> 00:35:04.119
No.

00:35:04.119 --> 00:35:06.119
Do we believe in hellfire?

00:35:06.119 --> 00:35:07.119
No.

00:35:07.119 --> 00:35:09.119
Do we believe that life evolved?

00:35:09.119 --> 00:35:10.119
No.

00:35:10.119 --> 00:35:14.119
Do we believe that we are unlovable

00:35:14.119 --> 00:35:17.119
and worthless to Jehovah?

00:35:17.119 --> 00:35:22.119
Our answer to that question should be no.

00:35:22.119 --> 00:35:24.119
And it should be just as decisive

00:35:24.119 --> 00:35:26.119
as our no to the other questions.

00:35:26.119 --> 00:35:27.119
And why?

00:35:27.119 --> 00:35:29.119
Because the idea that we are worthless

00:35:29.119 --> 00:35:31.119
or unlovable to Jehovah

00:35:31.119 --> 00:35:34.119
is a false doctrine.

00:35:34.119 --> 00:35:38.119
And we need to reject it just as firmly

00:35:38.119 --> 00:35:41.119
as we would reject any of Satan's other

00:35:41.119 --> 00:35:44.119
God dishonoring lies.

00:35:44.119 --> 00:35:49.119
Meditating on the ransom can help us do that.

00:35:49.119 --> 00:35:51.119
But besides meditating on the ransom,

00:35:51.119 --> 00:35:52.119
there's something else we can do

00:35:52.119 --> 00:35:54.119
to cope with negative emotions.

00:35:54.119 --> 00:35:58.119
Let's look at Psalm 61 verse 2.

00:35:58.119 --> 00:36:00.119
What David prayed for in this verse

00:36:00.119 --> 00:36:02.119
presents us with another key

00:36:02.119 --> 00:36:04.119
to dealing with negative emotions,

00:36:04.119 --> 00:36:07.119
including feelings of worthlessness.

00:36:07.119 --> 00:36:11.119
At Psalm 61 verse 2,

00:36:11.119 --> 00:36:13.119
David says to Jehovah,

00:36:13.119 --> 00:36:15.119
from the ends of the earth,

00:36:15.119 --> 00:36:16.119
I will cry out to you

00:36:16.119 --> 00:36:19.119
when my heart is in despair.

00:36:19.119 --> 00:36:21.119
Leave me on to a rock

00:36:21.119 --> 00:36:24.119
that is higher than I am.

00:36:24.119 --> 00:36:26.119
Here, Jehovah, David,

00:36:26.119 --> 00:36:28.119
is asking Jehovah for a different view

00:36:28.119 --> 00:36:30.119
in elevated one.

00:36:30.119 --> 00:36:32.119
And that's what we need

00:36:32.119 --> 00:36:34.119
when negative emotions plague us.

00:36:34.119 --> 00:36:36.119
As David wrote,

00:36:36.119 --> 00:36:38.119
we need to be placed on a rock

00:36:38.119 --> 00:36:40.119
that is higher than ourselves,

00:36:40.119 --> 00:36:42.119
higher than our imperfect

00:36:42.119 --> 00:36:45.119
and distorted reasoning.

00:36:45.119 --> 00:36:48.119
Now, scriptural truths can help us do that.

00:36:48.119 --> 00:36:50.119
For example,

00:36:50.119 --> 00:36:54.119
when the heart is in despair as David wrote,

00:36:54.119 --> 00:36:57.119
we may feel that no one can love us,

00:36:57.119 --> 00:36:59.119
not even Jehovah.

00:36:59.119 --> 00:37:01.119
But the elevated view from the rock

00:37:01.119 --> 00:37:03.119
reveals a scriptural truth.

00:37:03.119 --> 00:37:05.119
Romans 8.38 and 39.

00:37:05.119 --> 00:37:09.119
Nothing can separate us from God's love.

00:37:09.119 --> 00:37:11.119
When the heart is in despair,

00:37:11.119 --> 00:37:13.119
we feel that our mistakes

00:37:13.119 --> 00:37:16.119
are too great for Jehovah to forgive.

00:37:16.119 --> 00:37:18.119
But the elevated view from the rock

00:37:18.119 --> 00:37:20.119
reveals a scriptural truth.

00:37:20.119 --> 00:37:21.119
Romans 5.8,

00:37:21.119 --> 00:37:25.119
why we were yet sinners Christ died for us.

00:37:25.119 --> 00:37:27.119
As we mentioned before,

00:37:27.119 --> 00:37:29.119
Jesus died for sinners,

00:37:29.119 --> 00:37:31.119
not for perfect people.

00:37:31.119 --> 00:37:33.119
When the heart is in despair,

00:37:33.119 --> 00:37:35.119
we can't picture ourselves in paradise

00:37:35.119 --> 00:37:37.119
because in our heart,

00:37:37.119 --> 00:37:39.119
we feel condemned.

00:37:39.119 --> 00:37:42.369
But the elevated view

00:37:42.369 --> 00:37:44.369
from the rock reveals a scriptural truth.

00:37:44.369 --> 00:37:46.369
1 John 3.20,

00:37:46.369 --> 00:37:48.369
God is greater than our hearts

00:37:48.369 --> 00:37:50.369
and He knows all things,

00:37:50.369 --> 00:37:52.369
including the reasons

00:37:52.369 --> 00:37:54.369
why we might tend to think

00:37:54.369 --> 00:37:56.369
so negatively of ourselves.

00:37:56.369 --> 00:37:58.369
The point is,

00:37:58.369 --> 00:38:00.369
gradually, we can replace

00:38:00.369 --> 00:38:02.369
lowly negative thoughts

00:38:02.369 --> 00:38:06.369
with elevated scriptural truths.

00:38:06.369 --> 00:38:08.369
And we just mentioned three of those truths.

00:38:08.369 --> 00:38:10.369
Here's one more.

00:38:10.369 --> 00:38:12.369
Let's look at Malachi 3.17.

00:38:12.369 --> 00:38:14.369
Now, in its application,

00:38:14.369 --> 00:38:16.369
Malachi 3 is talking

00:38:16.369 --> 00:38:18.369
about Jehovah's spiritual temple.

00:38:18.369 --> 00:38:20.369
But in principle,

00:38:20.369 --> 00:38:22.369
this first shows us the high value

00:38:22.369 --> 00:38:24.369
of places on his people.

00:38:24.369 --> 00:38:26.369
Malachi 3.17 says,

00:38:26.369 --> 00:38:28.369
and they will be mine,

00:38:28.369 --> 00:38:30.369
says Jehovah of Armies.

00:38:30.369 --> 00:38:32.369
In the day when I produce

00:38:32.369 --> 00:38:34.369
a special property,

00:38:34.369 --> 00:38:36.369
or as the footnote renders it,

00:38:36.369 --> 00:38:38.369
a treasured possession,

00:38:38.369 --> 00:38:40.369
let's stop there.

00:38:40.369 --> 00:38:42.369
Notice how proudly

00:38:42.369 --> 00:38:44.369
Jehovah talks about his people.

00:38:44.369 --> 00:38:46.369
He says they will be mine.

00:38:46.369 --> 00:38:48.369
He even calls his people

00:38:48.369 --> 00:38:50.369
special property.

00:38:50.369 --> 00:38:52.369
And make no mistake.

00:38:52.369 --> 00:38:54.369
That term is thrown into the Bible

00:38:54.369 --> 00:38:56.369
just to make us feel good,

00:38:56.369 --> 00:38:58.369
or to give us empty praise.

00:38:58.369 --> 00:39:00.369
No, Jehovah's people

00:39:00.369 --> 00:39:02.369
are special to him.

00:39:02.369 --> 00:39:04.369
And why?

00:39:04.369 --> 00:39:06.369
Because he produced this property,

00:39:06.369 --> 00:39:08.369
we just read.

00:39:08.369 --> 00:39:10.369
In other words, Jehovah

00:39:10.369 --> 00:39:12.369
is cultivating in each one of us

00:39:12.369 --> 00:39:14.369
the very spiritual qualities

00:39:14.369 --> 00:39:16.369
that make us special to him.

00:39:16.369 --> 00:39:18.369
So again, going back to Psalm

00:39:18.369 --> 00:39:20.369
61, too,

00:39:20.369 --> 00:39:22.369
when the heart is in despair,

00:39:22.369 --> 00:39:24.369
as David wrote,

00:39:24.369 --> 00:39:26.369
we may only see our failings

00:39:26.369 --> 00:39:28.369
and imperfections.

00:39:28.369 --> 00:39:30.369
But the elevated view from the rock

00:39:30.369 --> 00:39:32.369
reveals a scriptural truth.

00:39:32.369 --> 00:39:34.369
Malachi 3.17,

00:39:34.369 --> 00:39:36.369
we are a special property

00:39:36.369 --> 00:39:38.369
to Jehovah,

00:39:38.369 --> 00:39:40.369
despite our flaws.

00:39:40.369 --> 00:39:42.369
And if it's difficult for us

00:39:42.369 --> 00:39:44.369
to accept that,

00:39:44.369 --> 00:39:46.369
we are a special person

00:39:46.369 --> 00:39:48.369
who sets the standard

00:39:48.369 --> 00:39:50.369
for what's special here.

00:39:50.369 --> 00:39:52.369
Not us.

00:39:52.369 --> 00:39:54.369
One sister who had an extremely

00:39:54.369 --> 00:39:56.369
negative view of herself

00:39:56.369 --> 00:39:58.369
was helped a reason on that.

00:39:58.369 --> 00:40:00.369
She says,

00:40:00.369 --> 00:40:02.369
a spiritually mature sister

00:40:02.369 --> 00:40:04.369
helped me to look at myself realistically

00:40:04.369 --> 00:40:06.369
as an imperfect human

00:40:06.369 --> 00:40:08.369
with strengths and weaknesses.

00:40:08.369 --> 00:40:10.369
No better or worse

00:40:10.369 --> 00:40:12.369
than any other brother or sister

00:40:12.369 --> 00:40:14.369
that no one comes to Jehovah

00:40:14.369 --> 00:40:16.369
without being drawn by his spirit.

00:40:16.369 --> 00:40:18.369
That's John 644.

00:40:18.369 --> 00:40:20.369
So Jehovah must see

00:40:20.369 --> 00:40:22.369
something lovable in me

00:40:22.369 --> 00:40:24.369
and who was I

00:40:24.369 --> 00:40:26.369
to despise what Jehovah loves.

00:40:26.369 --> 00:40:28.369
And notice how this sister

00:40:28.369 --> 00:40:30.369
is slowly moving away

00:40:30.369 --> 00:40:32.369
from that distorted mirror

00:40:32.369 --> 00:40:34.369
and coming to see herself

00:40:34.369 --> 00:40:36.369
the way Jehovah does.

00:40:36.369 --> 00:40:38.369
We can do the same.

00:40:38.369 --> 00:40:40.369
Is it easy?

00:40:40.369 --> 00:40:41.369
Absolutely not.

00:40:41.369 --> 00:40:43.369
The question 4 talks about

00:40:43.369 --> 00:40:45.369
strongly entrenched things

00:40:45.369 --> 00:40:47.369
that we need to overturn

00:40:47.369 --> 00:40:49.369
and it lists reasonings

00:40:49.369 --> 00:40:51.369
as one of those things.

00:40:51.369 --> 00:40:53.369
Now that could include

00:40:53.369 --> 00:40:55.369
our imperfect and distorted reasoning

00:40:55.369 --> 00:40:57.369
about our value to Jehovah.

00:40:57.369 --> 00:40:59.369
That reasoning might be so strongly entrenched

00:40:59.369 --> 00:41:01.369
that we need to keep praying about it.

00:41:01.369 --> 00:41:03.369
Keep studying.

00:41:03.369 --> 00:41:05.369
Or as we mentioned earlier,

00:41:05.369 --> 00:41:07.369
keep meditating on the ransom.

00:41:07.369 --> 00:41:09.369
But as we gradually replace

00:41:09.369 --> 00:41:11.369
the negative emotions

00:41:11.369 --> 00:41:13.369
with elevated scriptural truths,

00:41:13.369 --> 00:41:15.369
we'll be better able to move away

00:41:15.369 --> 00:41:17.369
from that distorted mirror

00:41:17.369 --> 00:41:19.369
and see ourselves

00:41:19.369 --> 00:41:23.320
the way Jehovah does.

00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:25.320
So to review,

00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:27.320
how can we cope with negative emotions

00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:29.320
that at times overwhelm us?

00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:31.320
First, meditate on the ransom.

00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:33.320
It is the most potent answer

00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:35.320
to the satanic lie

00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:37.320
that we are worthless

00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:39.320
or unlovable to Jehovah.

00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:41.320
Gradually replace

00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:43.320
lowly negative thoughts

00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:45.320
with elevated scriptural truths.

00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:47.320
Truth that will help us

00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:49.320
see ourselves the way Jehovah does.

00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:51.320
Those two suggestions

00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:53.320
can help us cope with negative emotions

00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:55.320
that have become a plague

00:41:55.320 --> 00:42:00.360
of our heart.

00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:02.360
Now in conclusion, a final thought.

00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:04.360
Whatever plays our heart,

00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:06.360
even if it's a situation

00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:08.360
that we haven't touched on this evening,

00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:10.360
remaining spiritually active

00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:12.360
will lighten our load.

00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:14.360
Now we at Bethel are blessed

00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:16.360
because we have plenty to do

00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:18.360
in Jehovah's work.

00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:20.360
And really, wherever we serve,

00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:22.360
theocratic activity will balance our thinking

00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:24.360
and help us to put the principles

00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:26.360
we discussed into practice.

00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:30.360
But our strongest means

00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:32.360
of coping with any plague

00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:34.360
of our heart is identified

00:42:34.360 --> 00:42:36.360
at Psalm 62, one and two.

00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:38.360
Let's read those verses.

00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:40.360
David says at Psalm 62,

00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:42.360
can lighten our load

00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:44.360
and make it easier for us to carry.

00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:48.360
Psalm 62, beginning with verse 1.

00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:52.360
Indeed, I wait silently for God.

00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:54.360
My salvation comes from Him.

00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:56.360
Indeed, He is my rock

00:42:56.360 --> 00:42:58.360
and my salvation,

00:42:58.360 --> 00:43:00.360
my secure refuge.

00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:04.360
I will never be greatly shaken.

00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:06.360
Let's think about that last phrase.

00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:08.360
I will never be greatly shaken.

00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:10.360
What does that mean?

00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:12.360
And how can it help us cope

00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:14.360
with the plague of our heart?

00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:16.360
Well, to illustrate that last year

00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:18.360
my wife and I were on a flight

00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:20.360
from El Paso to New York

00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:22.360
when the plane hit turbulence.

00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:24.360
And this was an ordinary turbulence.

00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:26.360
This turbulence was so bad

00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:28.360
that the pilot pulled the flight

00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:30.360
attendance to sit down

00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:32.360
and fasten her seat belts.

00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:34.360
It was a nerve-wracking experience.

00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:36.360
Obviously, we survived.

00:43:36.360 --> 00:43:38.360
But a day or two later

00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:40.360
I did some research.

00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:42.360
And I found out something about turbulence

00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:44.360
that many passengers don't know.

00:43:44.360 --> 00:43:46.360
You know what it is?

00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:48.360
It's that planes are built

00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:50.360
to handle turbulence.

00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:52.360
Even the really bad kind.

00:43:52.360 --> 00:43:54.360
In fact, when the pilot says

00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:56.360
he's searching for smoother air,

00:43:56.360 --> 00:44:00.360
he's not doing it so much for our safety

00:44:00.360 --> 00:44:02.360
as he is just for our comfort.

00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:04.360
And to keep the coffee in our cups.

00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:06.360
Turbulence might shake a plane,

00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:10.360
but the plane will not be greatly shaken.

00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:12.360
To cope with the plague of our heart,

00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:16.309
we need to understand

00:44:16.309 --> 00:44:18.309
something similar

00:44:18.309 --> 00:44:22.309
about the turbulence going on in our life.

00:44:22.309 --> 00:44:24.309
When we face a trial,

00:44:24.309 --> 00:44:26.309
our tendency might be to panic

00:44:26.309 --> 00:44:28.309
to grip the armrest, so to speak,

00:44:28.309 --> 00:44:30.309
to worry about what the next moment

00:44:30.309 --> 00:44:32.309
will burn.

00:44:32.309 --> 00:44:34.309
And to worry about what the next moment

00:44:34.309 --> 00:44:36.309
will bring

00:44:36.309 --> 00:44:38.309
to fear that we're going to crash.

00:44:38.309 --> 00:44:40.309
But we can have confidence

00:44:40.309 --> 00:44:42.309
that as David said,

00:44:42.309 --> 00:44:44.309
we will never be greatly shaken.

00:44:44.309 --> 00:44:46.309
We can handle the turbulence of any trial

00:44:46.309 --> 00:44:48.309
that comes our way.

00:44:48.309 --> 00:44:50.309
And why?

00:44:50.309 --> 00:44:52.309
Not because of our own strength.

00:44:52.309 --> 00:44:54.309
But because we feel as David expresses

00:44:54.309 --> 00:44:56.309
in verse two,

00:44:56.309 --> 00:44:58.309
Jehovah is my rock

00:44:58.309 --> 00:45:00.309
and my salvation,

00:45:00.309 --> 00:45:02.309
by our trial.

00:45:02.309 --> 00:45:04.309
But with Jehovah's help,

00:45:04.309 --> 00:45:06.309
we will never be greatly shaken.

00:45:06.309 --> 00:45:08.309
By all means, then,

00:45:08.309 --> 00:45:10.309
whatever hardship we face,

00:45:10.309 --> 00:45:12.309
whether it's circumstances

00:45:12.309 --> 00:45:14.309
that discourage us,

00:45:14.309 --> 00:45:16.309
people who upset us,

00:45:16.309 --> 00:45:18.309
negative emotions that overwhelm us

00:45:18.309 --> 00:45:20.309
or anything else,

00:45:20.309 --> 00:45:22.309
let us continue to make Jehovah

00:45:22.309 --> 00:45:24.309
our secure refuge,

00:45:24.309 --> 00:45:26.309
confident that he can help us cope

00:45:26.309 --> 00:45:28.309
with the plague of our heart.
