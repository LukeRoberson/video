00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:10.779
I had the privilege for two years of sitting on the same table as Sister Orham for morning worship.

00:00:10.779 --> 00:00:14.779
She expected nothing and appreciated everything that he did for her.

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:17.780
Sister Orham was affectionately known as Joy.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:20.780
And if you take the eith out of Joy,

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:24.780
you're left with the English word Joy and that's under it.

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:29.780
My impression of Joy when I first met her was here as this frail old lady.

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:32.780
But then when you got started to speak to Joy,

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.780
you were tapping into a tremendous depth.

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.780
About the age of 20, around about that time, I had the heavenly calling.

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.780
That was a big battle.

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.780
I couldn't understand why Jehovah would use a person like me.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.780
When I was 21, I got into pioneering in 1939.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.780
But the police were after me because I wouldn't join the armed forces.

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.780
And I was tried under a new act and they kept taking me into a side room

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.780
and saying, if you will see you're not connected with Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.780
not connected with the watchtower, you'll have a walk away.

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.780
I said, I am connected with the watchtower.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.780
I'm proud to be connected with the watchtower.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.780
And they said, then they are direct to you.

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.780
I said, no, my stand of not her doing as you wish.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.780
It's my own personal stand. So this went on.

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.780
In the end, they sent me to prison just for two months and let me out.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.780
I partnered with another sister and she and I went to Northern Ireland.

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.780
And Pioneer there for 18 months.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.780
And it was in Northern Ireland. We had our call to Gilead.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.780
In 1948, Joy was invited to Gilead.

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.780
And that was the 11th class.

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.780
It left an impression on me which I will never, ever, ever forget.

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.780
You pick up that spirit of good behaviour, of love.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.780
It's something that leaves its mark or it should do.

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.780
It has left its mark on me very, very much so.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.780
One thing brother, nor impressed on us,

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.780
you'll be three years on your assignment before you really love it.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.780
And it was true because it was a hard assignment.

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.780
After Gilead, she was assigned to be a missionary in Dublin in the Irish Republic.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.780
That was the time when Catholic priests used to organise mobs against the Pioneers.

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.780
She was full of joy but that didn't mean to say she had had an easy life.

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.780
You never went out from door to door without being mobs and attacked

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.780
and beaten up and thrown around and you could only do a few houses in a road

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.780
and you have to get away very quickly.

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.780
But we made a very good name.

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.780
People got to know we were completely neutral.

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.780
They chose four of us to work the business property

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.780
and I got some studies going in their offices.

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.780
But one place I went into, I walked the length of this draper shop

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.780
and I asked if I could go into the manager's office.

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.780
And as I went in, I didn't say a word.

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.780
I didn't owe my mouth even say good morning, but this man stood up and he said,

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.780
rust the light.

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.780
And he took hold of me by the scruff of my neck and the seat of my pants.

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.780
He lifted me up and he carried me the length of the store.

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.780
Well, like a silly one, I should have gone heavy on him, you see.

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.780
But he said to that, I lit my legs paddled and I was hanging on my book bag

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:10.780
not wanting to lose it.

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.780
And when he got to the front door, the staff, their eyes were absolutely gone.

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.780
He opened his front door and he threw me out of the tree and I went,

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.780
zoom and just met him, zoom again.

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.780
And one of the brothers was passing and he caught me and caught me steady

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.780
and said, whatever's going on.

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.780
And I couldn't stop laughing.

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.780
To me, it was very, very funny.

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.780
The rest was so crossed about it.

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:35.780
But I wasn't a store cross.

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.780
I thought it was quite hilarious.

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.780
I could see myself being carried through this shop.

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.780
Sky high, things like that happened.

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.780
These experiences did not dampen her zeal.

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.780
She always retained that missionary spirit.

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.780
I first met Joey when I was commuting to Bethel in the infirmary.

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.780
She was sitting on that old fashioned chair with this huge Bible

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.780
and she stayed there hours reading the Bible, praying to Yelva.

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.780
Often when you came in, she'd be in the middle of Bible reading

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.780
and she'd be saying something like, Daniel's just been thrown into the lion's den

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.780
or, oh, Jehovah's really angry, he's thundering from the heavens.

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.779
And it made me think, wow, she must have read the Bible so many times.

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:19.779
But every time it was as if it was happening right in front of her.

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:22.779
Right up until she became incapacitated,

00:04:22.779 --> 00:04:27.779
she was conducting Bible studies and helping people to come to know Jehovah.

00:04:27.779 --> 00:04:30.779
She was looking forward to her heavenly reward.

00:04:30.779 --> 00:04:36.779
And for her, that was the culmination of a life of joy in Jehovah's service

00:04:36.779 --> 00:04:40.779
and that she was just transferring to her next assignment.

00:04:40.779 --> 00:04:42.779
I'm very, very grateful for work.

00:04:42.779 --> 00:04:46.779
In fact, often in my prayers, pray to Jehovah that I have some good work to do today.

00:04:46.779 --> 00:04:49.779
I'm very grateful to have work to do.
