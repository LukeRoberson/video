00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:08.550
Welcome to the 2018 B. Courageous Regional Convention of

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.550
Jehovah's Witnesses. Each year, our convention is a highlight

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:18.550
of our worship. We know that you've been looking forward to this

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:23.550
year's program. Why has the governing body arranged for three

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.550
days of scriptural instruction on the subject of courage? All

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.549
around the earth. Our brothers and sisters are showing

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:37.549
godly courage. Still, it can be a challenge to do so when face

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:43.549
with various trials. As world conditions worsen, all of us

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:48.549
can expect to face greater tests of our courage in the future.

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:53.549
Soon, this world will experience the foretold great tribulation.

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:58.549
At that time, we'll no doubt need to act with courage as never

00:00:58.549 --> 00:01:04.549
before. In addition, Jehovah has assigned us the vital

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:09.549
work of preaching the good news. This work is refreshing and it

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:15.549
brings us great joy. But I'm sure you'll agree we need courage

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:20.549
so that we can fully accomplish our ministry, especially

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.549
in difficult times. We hope that this convention will

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:29.549
strengthen you to be courageous now and help you to be prepared

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.549
for what lies just ahead. Why does Jehovah allow his servants

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:39.549
whom he loves to face situations that call for courage? After

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:44.549
all, he has the power to remove any trial and he could

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.549
accomplish the preaching work by another means. Let's consider

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:53.549
the bigger issues involved. Satan has challenged the

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.549
rightfulness of Jehovah's rule and he has questioned our

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:03.549
motives for serving God. By not shielding us from all trials,

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:09.550
Jehovah grants us the privilege of making a reply to Satan.

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.550
Furthermore, Jehovah honors us by allowing us to preach

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.550
and bear witness to his name. At Luke chapter 22 verse 31,

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:25.550
Jesus told Simon Peter, look, Satan has demanded to have all

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:30.550
of you to sift you as wheat. Should we fear the devil's

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:35.550
efforts to break our integrity? Absolutely not. We agree with

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:41.550
Psalm 461, which says, God is our refuge and strength. As

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.550
loyal servants of Jehovah, we are under the protective care of

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:51.550
the Almighty Himself. During the next three days, you'll see

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:56.550
how Jehovah has been a refuge for his people in both ancient

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.550
and modern times. And you'll learn how Jehovah helps us to

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.550
show courage. Please pay careful attention to the entire

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:10.550
program. May Jehovah bless and reward you for the love you show

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:12.550
for his name.
