00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:07.099
Brother Thomas Kalameras, who serves at the United States branch together with his wife,

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:14.099
has spent close to four decades supporting various aspects of the organization's construction projects.

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:24.390
What has that experienced taught him that the work is not run by us?

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.390
Throughout history, men have built many beautiful and impressive buildings.

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:34.390
These structures have usually brought glory to men, not to God,

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:40.390
but those men are long gone, and even many of the structures no longer exist.

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:47.390
How true is the Scripture in Psalm 1271, unless Jehovah builds the house,

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.390
it is in vain that its builders work hard on it.

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:57.390
In our time too, Jehovah is using his people to build.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.390
We're working hard to build spirituality on interested ones,

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:08.390
and also we build structures in order to help individuals to learn about Jehovah and serve him.

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.390
In this type of construction, both spiritually and physical construction,

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.390
I've been involved for most of my life.

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:22.390
I was born in Greece, our family came into contact with the truth in the early 60s.

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.390
I was baptized when I was in high school.

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.390
I left school to get some practical training and architecture,

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.390
but I made pioneering my career.

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.390
In 1973, I met my dear wife, Margaret,

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.390
and together we enjoy many assignments.

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.390
We pioneered special pioneering. We went to Gilead.

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:51.390
We were invited to Bethel in 1979 to work in the engineering department.

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.390
We worked on designing new branches, assembly halls,

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:04.390
kingdom halls, renovation of existing branches, and remote translation offices.

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.389
Before we came to Bethel, we had seen how Jehovah provided for us individually.

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:18.389
But now we had the opportunity to see how Jehovah provided for the needs of his organization globally.

00:02:18.389 --> 00:02:26.389
By the year 2000, we became apparent that the present facility of the Britain branch was not meeting their needs.

00:02:26.389 --> 00:02:32.389
So, a site was located 50 miles north of London to relocate the branch there.

00:02:32.389 --> 00:02:37.389
However, the governing body decided to cancel the project.

00:02:37.389 --> 00:02:44.389
So, in 2008, the governing body wrote that now is a time to Jehovah's time

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:47.389
to find a property closer to London.

00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:55.389
So, a project was formed and a few years went by and a number of properties were searched and one was located closer to London.

00:02:55.389 --> 00:03:06.389
If something we planned falls through, it could mean that Jehovah had something else or better in mind to meet the needs of his organization.

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:14.389
Well, working in the Haiti branch, we learned a lesson not to compromise on safety.

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:23.389
The Brooklyn Engineering Department did the drawings for the branch and a local contractor was hired to build the structural work.

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:29.389
Now, the contractor, when he reviewed the drawings, told the branch committee that, really, this is over-design.

00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:33.389
You're wasting a lot of money by putting all that still in the building.

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:37.389
So, we wrote back and said, no, the drawings are okay.

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:45.389
The branch is designed according to the seismic zone that is in and the contractor to go ahead with the plants as drawn.

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:57.389
In 2010, when the earthquake came into Haiti, hundreds of thousands of people died because of inferior materials and methods of construction.

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:07.740
However, the branch did not suffer any damage and many people went there to find refuge.

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:13.740
We're so glad that Jehovah did not allow us to be swayed in this case.

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:19.740
Jehovah continues to direct a great physical building work and a spiritual work.

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:28.740
Jehovah trains his people how to work together for the work just ahead of us, the beautification of this earth to a paradise.

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:36.740
It is so important that we trust in Jehovah and not to lean upon our own understanding.

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:41.740
A life of building with Jehovah has shown me the wisdom of Psalm 1271.

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:48.740
If we keep building our lives with Jehovah, our building work will never be in vain.
