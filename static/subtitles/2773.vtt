00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:06.450
This month I'd like to talk about presenting your gifts to God.

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.369
We certainly have every reason to consider this topic.

00:00:10.369 --> 00:00:11.929
Well why is that?

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:14.410
It's because Jehovah gives us so much.

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:16.769
James chapter 1 verse 17 says,

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:22.489
Every good gift and every perfect present is from above,

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:26.530
coming down from the Father of the celestial lights.

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:30.730
For example, Jehovah allows us to enjoy the gift of life

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:36.250
even though our first parents tried to take that from us.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.250
He's provided us with a variety of foods.

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.369
The environment has just right to support life.

00:00:44.369 --> 00:00:47.409
He's given us His precious Word, the Bible,

00:00:47.409 --> 00:00:51.850
so that we can come to know Him and His purposes.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.490
And the greatest perfect present Jehovah's given us

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:57.329
is the ransom.

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.130
Jehovah sacrificed a great deal to arrange for Jesus

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:05.329
to buy back for us the hope of everlasting life.

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:08.930
This was at no obligation on Jehovah's part.

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.370
It was totally a gift of love.

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.609
Please read with me first, John 4.9.

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:19.609
By this, the love of God was revealed in our case

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:23.530
that God sent His only begotten Son into the world

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.370
so that we might gain life through Him.

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.010
What a gift of love from Jehovah are God.

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.209
What does that move us to do?

00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:34.890
Maybe you've had the experience of a close friend

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.569
or family member unexpectedly giving you a valuable gift.

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:43.290
Immediately, what are you thinking?

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.329
You're probably trying to think of what you can give in return.

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.930
How much more so would we want to present our gifts to God?

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:58.769
So as to show our sincere appreciation for all He's done.

00:01:58.769 --> 00:02:02.650
Let's consider some possible gifts that Jehovah would be pleased

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.250
to receive from us.

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.129
Many of you in our viewing audience have been moved

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.729
to give your life to Jehovah, dedicating yourself

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:13.569
to do His will.

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.490
That's commendable.

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:19.090
That's what Romans 12 urges us to do.

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.250
However, there are some of you, listening,

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.610
who've thought about this way of giving back to Jehovah,

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.490
but you haven't yet taken this vital step.

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:34.689
Notice the appeal the Apostle Paul makes at Romans 12 one.

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:38.689
Therefore, I appeal to you by the compassion of God brothers

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:42.050
to present your bodies as a living sacrifice,

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.610
holy and acceptable to God, a sacred service

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.610
with your power of reason.

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.969
Your life is precious.

00:02:50.969 --> 00:02:54.650
Presenting your body your whole soul to God

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.969
is one of the best gifts you can give to Him.
