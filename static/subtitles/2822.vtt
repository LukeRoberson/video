WEBVTT

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:09.679
First time we met David, we were in chains.

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:13.679
I'd seen a lot of things during my time as a guard.

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:19.059
But nothing, like the piece that you all had.

00:00:19.059 --> 00:00:24.059
Prison chains may be strong, but we all had something much stronger.

00:00:24.059 --> 00:00:27.059
But we had to work for that piece.

00:00:27.059 --> 00:00:29.059
Right Phil?

00:00:29.059 --> 00:00:31.059
That's right.

00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:36.060
See, there was a misunderstanding.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:44.750
That got blown all out of proportion, and I didn't handle it the best.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.750
The more I tried to defend myself, the worse it became.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:54.750
Brothers, there must be some mistake.

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.750
This isn't true. You know me.

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:07.120
I wasn't prepared for how far I would go.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.120
There's one more announcement.

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.120
Brother Philip Kim is no longer serving as an elder.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.810
That brings our meeting to you.

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.810
The next few months were a real struggle.

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:29.569
But when more details came to light, I thought I'd be reappointed.

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:38.609
But I wasn't.

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:41.609
I couldn't understand why.

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:46.609
I felt bitterness growing inside.

00:01:46.609 --> 00:02:04.140
Everything became about me, how I felt, what I deserved.

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:11.139
It was like a fog that stopped me from seeing what Jehovah deserved.

00:02:11.139 --> 00:02:15.090
And I really needed his help.

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:24.090
I found comfort and accounts of Jehovah's servants were either misunderstood or misjudged,

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.090
but maintained their loyalty to him.

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:40.840
They helped me realize that it's a privilege just to be in Jehovah's organization.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:48.840
Being at peace with my brothers was more important than any appointed position.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:03:03.629
Without peace, I don't know how we could have managed what was to come.

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:06.629
Or I'd throw out his fat today.

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:11.629
And I'll be your secretary, just like Barrick was the Jeremiah.

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:14.629
I don't know what I'd do without you.
