00:00:02.029 --> 00:00:08.029
My comments to you today are based on 2nd Peter chapter 1 verse 19.

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:13.029
There it states, we have the prophetic word made more sure.

00:00:13.029 --> 00:00:18.030
Yes, we are fortified by the prophetic word.

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:23.030
Actually, there is no one on earth today that is not affected by prophecy,

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:26.030
even if he is not aware of it.

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:28.030
What is a prophecy?

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:35.030
The Hebrew term for prophecy is not limited to predicting or foretelling something in the future.

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:40.030
It also includes divine commands or inspired instruction.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:48.030
The Samaritan woman at the well recognized Jesus as a prophet because he revealed not future things,

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:54.030
but things about her past that he could not have known except by divine power.

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.030
The source of all true prophecy is Jehovah God.

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:10.030
At 2nd Peter chapter 1 verse 21, it is said of prophecy that men spoke from God as they were moved by Holy Spirit.

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:21.030
In addition to transmitting prophecy by Holy Spirit, Jehovah occasionally communicated such messages by means of angels.

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.030
One outstanding prophet was Daniel.

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:36.030
In about 536 before our common era, Daniel recorded a vision involving world powers having interaction with God's servants.

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:42.030
Turned with me to Daniel chapter 8 verses 21 and 22.

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:48.030
Daniel's vision was of animals representing governments.

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:54.030
Note this remarkable prophecy at Daniel chapter 8 verses 21 and 22.

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:05.269
The hairy male goat stands for the king of Greece, and the great horn that was between its eyes stands for the first king.

00:02:05.269 --> 00:02:18.840
As for the horn that was broken, so that force stood up instead of it, there are four kingdoms from his nation that will stand up, but not with his power.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:33.840
Interestingly, the Bible specifically named Greece, the ruler under which Greece became a world power in relation to God's people like a great horn was the Macedonian Alexander the Great.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:46.840
Alexander's rulership was short-lived. He died young in the year 323 before our common era, 213 years after Daniel wrote his book.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:56.840
Jehovah's angel had told Daniel that there would be four kingdoms from his nation that will stand up in place of the Greece Empire.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:04.840
And chapter 11 verse 4 specifically states that the four regions would not go to his descendants.

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.840
Do the historical facts support these prophecies?

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:19.840
Yes, Alexander's two sons from different women, Heracles and Alexander the Fourth both were killed before they reached adulthood.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:29.840
Isn't it astounding how precisely the prophecy came true that the rulership would not be passed on to Alexander's posterity?

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:37.840
But the prophecy also foretold that Alexander's empire would be divided up into four kingdoms.

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:52.840
Did that happen? Yes, one source listed 72 different military leaders under Alexander the Great, but the prophecy said only four would eventually rule in his place.

00:03:52.840 --> 00:04:05.840
After Alexander's death there were constant fierce battles between these military leaders, but finally just four dynasties resulted, just as the Bible prophesied.

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:13.840
One was that of General Cassander, son of Antipater, in Macedonia and Greece.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:20.839
The second was that of General Lecymachus in Asia Minor and European Thrace.

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:35.839
Third was the one of General Celucus, Nicotr, the Conqueror, who secured Babylon, media, Syria, Persia and the provinces eastward to the Indus River.

00:04:35.839 --> 00:04:47.839
And finally the fourth was that of General Tholomy Sotr, son of Legus, who secured Egypt, Libya, Arabia, Palestine and Silis Syria.

00:04:47.839 --> 00:04:56.839
These four proclaimed themselves King around 305 before our common era, 18 years after the death of Alexander.

00:04:56.839 --> 00:05:05.839
The prophecy was so detailed, its fulfillment is fascinating proof of divine inspiration.

00:05:05.839 --> 00:05:10.839
Does this not strengthen your faith and trust in the Bible?
