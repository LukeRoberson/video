00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:09.480
Welcome to the November 2014 program of JW Broadcasting.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.480
This month, you will enjoy meeting a witness couple who lived a comfortable life,

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:20.480
but then one day came to the realization that they could do more in Jehovah's service.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.480
Also, we will visit our brand new educational centre in Florida

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.480
and meet some of the first students of the new school for Kingdom Evangelises.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.479
And we'll have an archive video interview with Brother Lloyd Barry,

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:59.539
who shares his experiences as one of the early missionaries in Japan.

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:02.539
We were all excited with the announcement of the new school

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:07.540
that replaced the school for single brothers and the one for Christian couples.

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.540
It is the school for Kingdom Evangelises with an all-new curriculum.

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.540
We're pleased to inform you that the first two classes in the United States

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.540
have completed and the students have received their assignments.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:27.540
One of the classes was held in a beautiful new facility in Palm Coast, Florida.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.540
This is a beautifully refurbished facility for theocratic education.

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.540
We're pleased to provide you with a look at the property

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.540
and the work that was accomplished to make it ready for the first class.

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.540
You will also hear from some of the students and instructors.

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:51.680
Please enjoy this informational video.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.680
After praying and praying that I could be involved at 72 years old,

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.680
this facility came to me.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.680
This is the closest thing I'm ever going to get to working at Bethel.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:10.629
But as far as I'm concerned, it's everything I've wanted to do my whole life.

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:15.629
The new property was used as a training facility by the previous owner.

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:20.629
Situated on 13 acres, it consists of nine classrooms,

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:24.629
200 guest rooms, and a kitchen and dining room.

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:27.629
Although acquired an excellent condition and partially furnished,

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:31.629
the new campus still required extensive renovations

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:34.629
before the first students arrived on September 4th.

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:37.629
And the support was overwhelming.

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:39.629
At times it's hard to get them to go home for the night.

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:41.629
They just want to stay and continue to work

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:44.629
because they see the amount of work that needs to be done.

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:47.629
And we had a very tight time frame.

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:50.629
The work that was necessary was extensive cleaning.

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:53.629
There was painting work to be done.

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:55.629
Electrical work to be done.

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:57.629
HVAC work to be done.

00:02:57.629 --> 00:02:58.629
Plumbing.

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:02.629
And then extensive landscaping was also done.

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:06.629
And it just made the whole area absolutely gorgeous.

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:09.629
Although many of our brothers put in many hours,

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:11.629
others contributed financially.

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:16.629
Whatever the circumstances, everyone put in a whole hearted effort.

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:20.629
We have a brother and he's an older brother.

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:23.629
He showed up one day, a little later than he normally would.

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:26.629
And he apologized.

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:30.629
He said he had just come from a treatment, a medical treatment.

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:34.629
And he said that prior to this project,

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:36.629
he could hardly get out of the bed.

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:40.629
But every day, he's feeling better and better

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:43.629
because he's able to work on site here.

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:45.629
There was a time just a matter of a few weeks ago

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:48.629
when they said that I wasn't going to live.

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:52.629
I have a cancer and I should have a number of cancers.

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:59.629
And I actually felt like I wasn't going to be able to do anything anymore.

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:01.629
And Joe was a arrangement.

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:04.629
And they're letting me be an assistant overseer here

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:06.629
for the outside groundscape.

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:11.629
And I'll do that as long as I'm able to do it.

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:14.629
During the 2015 service year,

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:17.629
14 classes of the School for Kingdom Evangelizers

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:22.100
have been scheduled at the Palm Coast Facility.

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:27.100
With rooming on site, the students can now spend more time on studying.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:32.100
This place is perfect for education because it's a campus environment.

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:35.100
Some of our brothers would have to travel as much as an hour

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:39.100
to be able to be accommodated in some of the homes and the brothers and sisters.

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.100
So it gives them more time for study.

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.100
It is a quieter atmosphere for study.

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:49.100
We're talking about the impact of schools like this on a congregation at Need Help.

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:53.100
We've had a number of reports from the previous schools

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:56.100
about where individuals were assigned to a congregation.

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:59.100
The reports have been phenomenal.

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:02.100
The students say the congregations open their arms and welcome them.

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:06.100
And the congregations say this is the best thing that Jehovah could have done for us.

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:10.100
While the school is a blessing for both students and congregations,

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:13.100
it has been especially appreciated by the single sisters

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:17.100
that now have an additional opportunity to expand their ministry.

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:20.100
Sister Tong is one of them.

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:27.100
I'm just like everyone else who just wants to serve Jehovah

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:30.100
with everything I have.

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:34.100
When the announcement was made, I was so excited.

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:40.100
And I made it my goal to submit my application and get my life ready.

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:43.100
I had to get my finances together.

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:49.100
I had to see if I was able to quit my job and be okay.

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:54.100
My brother had just found out he had cancer.

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:57.100
I staged three cancer.

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:02.100
So I had to see whether or not I could leave the family

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:05.100
and that they would be okay with it.

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:09.100
By looking at how Jehovah has guided the students to be able to attend the school,

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:14.100
we can be confident that this new facility will be used to the full.

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:18.100
Sometimes our challenge was not enough time.

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:21.100
We'll have to crunch a schedule

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:26.100
and getting the right people at the right job at the correct time too.

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:31.100
But it seems like every time it worked out the best way it could have worked out.

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:34.100
Jehovah Spirit guided us to make good decisions.

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:36.100
We can see directly that Jehovah has said,

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:38.100
this is where I want you to go.

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:44.100
I believe that the day that I arrived, the carpet had not even been laid yet.

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:49.100
But the next morning, everything was done and the sofas were on top of the carpets

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:52.100
as if nothing had happened the night before.

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:59.100
And I brought to my mind how amazing Jehovah is people, how hardworking they are.

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:04.100
There was perhaps maybe the time frame of a month and a half

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:10.100
and I thought to myself, how will it be possible to get this facility ready

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:14.100
and to make it an educational center?

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:21.100
When I came to this place and I saw hundreds of brothers and sisters who were here,

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:27.100
volunteering and I thought to myself the only way, the only way,

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:45.060
the only way it could be done was through the Spirit of God.

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:53.339
As we have seen time and time again,

00:07:53.339 --> 00:07:56.339
with Jehovah's Spirit and willing workers,

00:07:56.339 --> 00:07:59.339
much can be accomplished to Jehovah's praise.

00:07:59.339 --> 00:08:04.339
We look forward to the dedication of this fully refurbished educational facility

00:08:04.339 --> 00:08:06.339
in the not-too-distant future.

00:08:06.339 --> 00:08:12.939
While it's important that we care for our own spirituality and that of our family,

00:08:12.939 --> 00:08:17.939
our ministry revolves heavily around helping other people.

00:08:17.939 --> 00:08:24.939
For a few minutes, I'd like to address the theme, helping people of all language groups.

00:08:24.939 --> 00:08:29.939
Do you feel the urgency of the times in which we are now living?

00:08:29.939 --> 00:08:33.940
What a privilege we have to be serving God in these last days

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:37.940
at a time when Jehovah is speeding up the kingdom preaching work.

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:43.940
We are seeing the fulfillment of the words recorded in Isaiah 60, verse 22.

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:46.940
Let's read that scripture together.

00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:51.940
Isaiah, chapter 60, and verse 22.

00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:53.940
There, Jehovah tells us,

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:57.940
the little one will become a thousand

00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:01.940
and the small one are mighty nation.

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:06.940
I myself Jehovah will speed it up in its own time.

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:12.379
No matter where we look in the earthly part of Jehovah's organization,

00:09:12.379 --> 00:09:16.379
we see that things are progressing at an amazing rate.

00:09:16.379 --> 00:09:19.379
The preaching work is penetrating more places.

00:09:19.379 --> 00:09:22.379
The Theocratic schools are helping thousands

00:09:22.379 --> 00:09:26.379
and the construction work Earthwide is growing.

00:09:26.379 --> 00:09:30.379
There are so many exciting developments that we could discuss.

00:09:31.379 --> 00:09:36.379
But I'd like to discuss with you something that's very close to my heart.

00:09:36.379 --> 00:09:41.379
It's another aspect of our work that has seen some amazing increases,

00:09:41.379 --> 00:09:46.379
namely the translation work that is being accomplished by Jehovah's people.

00:09:46.379 --> 00:09:52.700
Just a few decades ago, we were producing Bible literature

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:55.700
in a little over 200 languages.

00:09:55.700 --> 00:10:00.700
But that figure has now risen to well over 700 languages

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:04.700
and the number continues to increase every week.

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:09.700
Why, just last service year alone, approval was given to start translating

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:12.700
into 88 new languages.

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:17.700
Even more amazing is the fact that some 700 languages are available

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:21.700
on our JW.org website, either as a site language

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:27.700
or as publications that can be downloaded free of charge.

00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:32.700
But why is it necessary to do all this translation work?

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:36.700
Is it so that we can become known as the organization

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:40.700
that produces literature in the most number of languages?

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:42.700
No.

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:47.700
We aren't engaged in an academic exercise or some competition.

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:52.700
Rather, we desire to work in harmony with Jehovah's will.

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:56.700
And what is Jehovah's will concerning this matter?

00:10:56.700 --> 00:11:01.700
The answer to that question is found in the inspired words of the Apostle Paul

00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:07.700
as recorded in 1 Timothy, chapter 2, and verses 3 and 4.

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:13.700
That's 1 Timothy, chapter 2, verses 3 and 4.

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:18.700
This is fine and acceptable in the sight of our Savior, God,

00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:22.700
whose will is that all sorts of people should be saved

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:26.700
and come to an accurate knowledge of truth.

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:32.700
The fact is that all sorts of people speak all sorts of languages.

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:36.700
Clearly, then, Jehovah wants everyone to hear the kingdom message

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:39.700
in their own language so that they can be saved

00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:43.700
and come to an accurate knowledge of truth.

00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:47.700
To illustrate what is involved in accomplishing this work,

00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:50.700
imagine this scenario.

00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:54.700
You're assigned to preach in an area where people speak a language

00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:57.700
that doesn't have any literature at all.

00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:03.700
Perhaps you've tried to learn that language and you start preaching to them.

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:07.700
Before long, many show an interest in the truth.

00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:12.700
But how can you study with them as they have no literature in their language?

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:16.700
Well, they may have a Bible in their language,

00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:21.700
so you might be able to teach them by just using that Bible.

00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:24.700
But could they prepare ahead of time for the study?

00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:28.700
And how could they do personal Bible study?

00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:31.700
Eventually, they start coming to the meetings.

00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:34.700
But what songs can they sing?

00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:36.700
What material could they discuss?

00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:39.700
And how could they prepare for the meetings?

00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:43.700
If they don't understand basic Bible truths,

00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:46.700
how could they prepare for baptism?

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:53.700
It wouldn't take long for you to realize that these people need literature in their own language.

00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:58.700
It's not enough for them to attend meetings held in a language they don't understand.

00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:07.700
Regarding Christian meetings, the Apostle Paul wrote the words recorded in 1 Corinthians 14 and verse 9.

00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:11.700
1 Corinthians 14 verse 9.

00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:18.700
In the same way, unless you with the tongue use speech that is easily understood,

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:21.700
how will anyone know what is being said?

00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:25.700
You will, in fact, be speaking into the air.

00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:28.700
Well, none of us want to do that.

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:35.700
That's why the governing body continues to approve the translation of our literature into more and more languages,

00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:44.700
so as to fill the spiritual needs of those who speak these languages and to help them to come to an accurate knowledge of the truth.

00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:53.700
It's true that many of those who speak these languages already know another more common language to be able to converse with others.

00:13:53.700 --> 00:14:01.700
So why go to all the trouble of translating the Bible's message into these less common languages?

00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:07.700
It's because we try to reach these persons in the language of their heart.

00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:14.700
Jehovah God himself set the example by what he did on the day of Pentecost in the year 33 CE.

00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:25.700
You might remember that he miraculously enabled the crowds of visitors there in Jerusalem to hear the message not just in the major languages they may have known,

00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:33.700
but also in their own native languages or the languages of their birth.

00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:39.700
This reminds me of an experience I heard while visiting some islands in the South Pacific.

00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:46.700
The brothers there told me about a man who had learned the truth in a language that was not his own native tongue,

00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:54.700
but recently he had had an opportunity to hear the truth in his own language, the language of his birth.

00:14:54.700 --> 00:15:07.700
What was his reaction? He said, before I could only smell the spiritual food, but now I can really taste it and enjoy it.

00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:17.700
How it strengthens our faith to know that our loving Heavenly Father desires that all sorts of persons have an opportunity to hear the truth about him.

00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:32.220
And what a privilege we have to be associated with an organization that is helping people of all language groups large and small to do exactly that.

00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:44.220
The correspondence department at World Headquarters is heavily involved in directing individuals from all over the world to meetings and publications in their native tongue.

00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:50.220
While you and I are out in the service, this is what takes place behind the scenes.

00:15:50.220 --> 00:16:24.779
The zealous preaching work carried out by Jehovah's Witnesses touches the lives of millions.

00:16:24.779 --> 00:16:40.669
The message and publications they share bring relief to a weary heart, reach beyond the boundaries of language and class.

00:16:41.669 --> 00:17:02.850
Sure, I have a bite.

00:17:02.850 --> 00:17:05.849
Yeah, yeah, you know what I have some medications.

00:17:05.849 --> 00:17:21.700
Thank you.

00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:23.700
Being hope to the hopeless.

00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:28.099
So what do you think the future holds?

00:17:28.099 --> 00:17:31.099
I don't know, I'd like to think things will get better.

00:17:31.099 --> 00:17:33.099
You know what, they're calling me, I have to go.

00:17:33.099 --> 00:17:35.099
Let me just leave that with you.

00:17:35.099 --> 00:17:39.740
Okay, okay, thank you very much.

00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:50.769
Understanding to those searching draws parents closer to their children.

00:17:50.769 --> 00:18:09.089
Every month, thousands of pieces of correspondence are received from around the world.

00:18:09.089 --> 00:18:14.089
Upon arrival, mail is sorted and delivered for processing.

00:18:14.089 --> 00:18:19.089
It's exciting to receive letters in so many different languages.

00:18:19.089 --> 00:18:27.089
Since many letters must be translated, I use various samples to identify the language.

00:18:27.089 --> 00:18:32.089
Grace's letter, like many others, can be quite challenging to identify.

00:18:32.089 --> 00:18:34.089
This is Ebo.

00:18:34.089 --> 00:18:42.089
So her letter is prepared to be sent electronically to the Nigeria branch for translation.

00:18:42.089 --> 00:18:47.089
When a translated letter is received, its purpose is brought to light.

00:18:47.089 --> 00:18:55.329
Grace was so moved by the offer that she requested more literature.

00:18:55.329 --> 00:19:01.329
We can forward Grace's information to the nearest Ebo speaking publisher.

00:19:01.329 --> 00:19:08.329
Soon, she will receive not only literature in her language, but a personal visit.

00:19:08.329 --> 00:19:09.329
Hey, Mercy, how are you?

00:19:09.329 --> 00:19:10.329
I'm fine, how you doing?

00:19:10.329 --> 00:19:11.329
Excellent.

00:19:11.329 --> 00:19:14.329
You know, I have a follow-up form for you, someone that speaks Ebo.

00:19:14.329 --> 00:19:16.329
I think they live in your neighborhood.

00:19:16.329 --> 00:19:17.329
Hi.

00:19:17.329 --> 00:19:19.329
I would like a Bible study.

00:19:19.329 --> 00:19:23.329
So your first name is Alex?

00:19:23.329 --> 00:19:28.329
I just have a follow-up form for an interested person I met in public witnessing.

00:19:28.329 --> 00:19:33.329
Every day, elders use JW.org to send please follow-up forms to the US branch.

00:19:33.329 --> 00:19:40.329
These forms contain information that help us fulfill the requests of spiritually hungry ones.

00:19:40.329 --> 00:19:46.329
Alex's address is matched to a database of congregations within the US branch territory.

00:19:46.329 --> 00:19:53.329
An electronic form is then created and sent to the corresponding congregations JW.org account.

00:19:53.329 --> 00:20:01.329
Before long, a grateful publisher will be privileged to provide Alex his Bible study.

00:20:01.329 --> 00:20:06.329
Every month, hundreds of letters are received from inmates in correctional facilities,

00:20:06.329 --> 00:20:10.329
like Paul, who has requested a personal copy of the Bible.

00:20:10.329 --> 00:20:16.430
A personalized entry is made for him in our program.

00:20:16.430 --> 00:20:20.430
This entry includes information about the facility in which he is incarcerated,

00:20:20.430 --> 00:20:24.430
like what literature can be sent and whether they allow visitors.

00:20:24.430 --> 00:20:30.430
Paul's request and an address label are sent electronically to the shipping department at Waukel,

00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:32.430
where it is prepared for mail-in.

00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:39.210
In an effort to provide Paul with further assistance,

00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:45.210
a follow-up letter is sent to the closest contact congregation so he can be visited in the near future.

00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:52.009
Welcome, my name is Louis.

00:20:52.009 --> 00:20:53.009
Good to meet you.

00:20:53.009 --> 00:20:55.009
My name is Paul.

00:20:55.009 --> 00:21:02.009
Amicia is one of thousands who have used JW.org to request a Bible study in their own language.

00:21:02.009 --> 00:21:06.009
Amicia's request is reviewed for accuracy and completeness.

00:21:06.009 --> 00:21:12.009
We learn that she is a student at Burton University who prefers literature in Bengali.

00:21:12.009 --> 00:21:18.009
Her address is confirmed and the corresponding congregation number is added to the form.

00:21:18.009 --> 00:21:21.009
Then an electronic referral is sent for follow-up.

00:21:21.009 --> 00:21:27.009
You can imagine the surprise when she is contacted by witnesses who speak her native language.

00:21:27.009 --> 00:21:37.809
That looks beautiful.

00:21:37.809 --> 00:21:47.339
Numerous pieces of correspondence are received for the world headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:21:47.339 --> 00:21:56.559
Included in these are many heartfelt expressions of gratitude.

00:21:57.559 --> 00:22:03.559
These letters are organized, scanned, and sent to the corresponding committees of the governing body.

00:22:03.559 --> 00:22:18.109
We can assure you that these expressions of appreciation bring our dear brothers great joy.

00:22:34.109 --> 00:22:52.109
Every year thousands of spiritually hungry ones come to know Jehovah and become his witnesses.

00:22:52.109 --> 00:22:57.109
You are then to find yourself as one of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:22:57.109 --> 00:23:15.519
It is truly our joy to provide timely assistance that can have a life-changing effect for so many.

00:23:15.519 --> 00:23:26.279
Isn't it beautiful to see how much work goes into helping individuals of all backgrounds to worship the true God Jehovah?

00:23:26.279 --> 00:23:30.279
But there are so many aspects of sacred service.

00:23:30.279 --> 00:23:36.279
Brother Lloyd Barry, who served on the governing body until he finished his earthly course in 1999,

00:23:36.279 --> 00:23:41.279
was a missionary and was sent across the world to spread the kingdom good news.

00:23:41.279 --> 00:23:48.279
While it was not always easy, brother Barry was greatly blessed by Jehovah for his faithful service.

00:23:48.279 --> 00:23:55.279
Enjoy this lively presentation of the early days of his missionary life in Japan.

00:23:55.279 --> 00:24:04.099
We went on to Gilead school and what a marvelous place Gilead was.

00:24:04.099 --> 00:24:08.099
We were in the 11th class, Melbourne myself.

00:24:08.099 --> 00:24:18.099
The second international class, we had them there from all over Europe and from Great Britain and Australia and New Zealand.

00:24:18.099 --> 00:24:22.099
There were 108 in the class. Brother Nord come down.

00:24:22.099 --> 00:24:27.099
He knew of the troubles in Japan and he'd asked for volunteers to go to Japan.

00:24:27.099 --> 00:24:33.099
So some 70 of the 108 volunteered to go to Japan.

00:24:33.099 --> 00:24:42.099
He decided that was too many but he selected a group of 28 to learn the Japanese language while the others were all learning French.

00:24:42.099 --> 00:24:50.099
So we were well prepared to go to Japan but after we graduated, well you couldn't get into Japan.

00:24:50.099 --> 00:24:57.410
It was just after the war and anyone who went there had to have a place pre-arranged to live in.

00:24:57.410 --> 00:25:04.410
Finally brother Don Haslet and his wife Mabel Haslet went there as the initial missionaries.

00:25:04.410 --> 00:25:14.410
Don did a splendid work of finding homes and purchasing homes at a very low price in those days where other missionaries could be accommodated.

00:25:14.410 --> 00:25:19.410
And finally the permits came through for our group to go to Japan.

00:25:19.410 --> 00:25:23.410
Travel was interesting in those days. It was a troop ship.

00:25:23.410 --> 00:25:31.410
All the men were in one dormitory about 25 passengers and one dormitory and all the women were in with other women.

00:25:31.410 --> 00:25:36.410
But we survived the trip until the last day and we ran into our first typhoon.

00:25:36.410 --> 00:25:42.410
May, what a typhoon that was. It was just like Andrew, the hurricane Andrew that hit Florida.

00:25:42.410 --> 00:25:50.410
But here we were out at sea and the waves were mountains above us and the ship was tossing and plunging into the depths there.

00:25:50.410 --> 00:25:55.410
Everyone aboard was seasick but I guess that was all part of the fun.

00:25:55.410 --> 00:26:03.410
Next morning the typhoon had gone. The sky was so clear and there we were right facing up against Mount Fuji.

00:26:03.410 --> 00:26:10.410
A beautiful view and the clear air at Mount Fuji and we thought well this is a nice welcome to Japan.

00:26:10.410 --> 00:26:19.410
So we sailed into Yokohama port there and we looked at those people and we knew at the time they were only a handful.

00:26:19.410 --> 00:26:26.410
Maybe half a dozen kingdom publishers active in the country we wondered well anything ever come out of this.

00:26:26.410 --> 00:26:34.410
So we went up to Tokyo we saw the branch there and that night they shipped us down to Kobe which is our missionary assignment.

00:26:34.410 --> 00:26:38.410
And I'll never forget those early missionary days there.

00:26:38.410 --> 00:26:45.410
We first arrived we didn't have any beds so we just cut down the grass in the garden and heaped grass in the rooms

00:26:45.410 --> 00:26:52.410
and put a blanket across the grass and we slept on the grass for about three weeks until we could get some beds

00:26:52.410 --> 00:26:58.410
and everyone wanted to listen to us. And our big problem was to find out who was really interested in the truth.

00:26:58.410 --> 00:27:06.410
In Melbourne for example she talked to a lady at the house and this lady showed much interest in the foreigners.

00:27:06.410 --> 00:27:12.410
She went upstairs and she brought down a Japanese English dictionary and they talked through this dictionary for a while.

00:27:12.410 --> 00:27:21.410
Melbourne got a study there and the lady next door studied with them and she was one of our first publishers that woman that we met on the first day.

00:27:21.410 --> 00:27:29.410
In fact they both became publishers and the senior one she's pioneered for years and years.

00:27:29.410 --> 00:27:33.410
We got a little fruitage there on the very first day.

00:27:33.410 --> 00:27:39.410
I remember one month when we had 12 missionaries in the home we reported 360 studies.

00:27:39.410 --> 00:27:46.410
That was 30 studies for missionary so you can imagine we weren't doing anything there but conduct studies.

00:27:46.410 --> 00:27:49.410
The problem was who were really interested.

00:27:49.410 --> 00:27:57.410
Let me cut that down after a while because they realised you had to keep up house to house activity to identify new ones.

00:27:57.410 --> 00:28:06.410
We used to have a lot of fun learning the language. One of the first public talks I gave I went from Kobe to Osaka and I was giving this talk.

00:28:06.410 --> 00:28:13.410
There were two young Japanese ladies sitting in the front row and they were straining their ears, they were listening, listening.

00:28:13.410 --> 00:28:18.410
And after two months they looked at each other and they both first out laughing.

00:28:18.410 --> 00:28:25.410
So after I had finished the talk I said to the young ladies what was so funny about my talk.

00:28:25.410 --> 00:28:34.410
They said well we were trying so hard to understand your English and suddenly we realised there was Japanese.

00:28:34.410 --> 00:28:38.410
So that's how good my Japanese was in those days.

00:28:38.410 --> 00:28:46.410
After we learned enough of the language to really converse with the people and really get to and fro with them in the Japanese language.

00:28:46.410 --> 00:28:53.410
And right away as soon as we started to study in Japanese we lost about two thirds of our studies.

00:28:53.410 --> 00:28:59.410
And that's how we learned who were interested in us or who were interested in the truth.

00:28:59.410 --> 00:29:07.410
It's interesting that in the first ten years in Japan and we had up to 60 missionaries in the country by that time

00:29:07.410 --> 00:29:17.410
we got just 1000 publishers and now in Japan they get 1000 publishers increase every month.

00:29:17.410 --> 00:29:28.410
But when the work really started to blossom was when families came in and families formed the foundation of the congregations.

00:29:28.410 --> 00:29:36.410
If you had two or three good families, husband, wife, children and the truth you had a foundation there you could really build on.

00:29:36.410 --> 00:29:44.410
And that has been one of the big contributory points in the development of the work in Japan.

00:29:44.410 --> 00:29:53.410
You talk about Jehovah speeding the work up well that means it's been speeded up 120 times since those early days of missionary work.

00:29:53.410 --> 00:30:05.410
There's nothing here on this earth to compare with God's organisation. There's never been anything even back in Bible times to compare with what Jehovah has now and what he's doing now.

00:30:05.410 --> 00:30:21.410
So I must say it's been a great privilege to be in contact with the door and when you look back over the years you really do appreciate your privileges and it makes you feel humble and that you should be a lot more humble than you really are

00:30:21.410 --> 00:30:33.410
because after all none of us is more than just a little piece of dirt you might say and why is it that Jehovah uses us stick at it near brothers and sisters.

00:30:33.410 --> 00:30:47.410
You're in perhaps the most privileged place in the world today and let your joy keep overflowing and just stay with it and Jehovah will bless you.

00:30:47.410 --> 00:31:00.130
If you have the circumstances to expand your ministry to serve with the need is greater like brother and sister Barry did I warmly recommend it.

00:31:00.130 --> 00:31:09.130
I had the privilege of serving in Fiji and some nearby islands a few years back and I still have very fond memories from my time there.

00:31:09.130 --> 00:31:15.130
But it's not a requirement to move to another country to serve with the need is greater.

00:31:15.130 --> 00:31:21.920
You can talk to your circuit overseer to see if there's a need locally in the circuit.

00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:34.920
You're about to meet the Gonoz. They have served in Bethel for 44 years and brother Gonoz has served as the coordinator of the Netherlands branch committee since 1990.

00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:50.740
But looking back on their long service for Jehovah they set priorities early on that changed the rest of their lives.

00:31:50.740 --> 00:31:57.740
I was raised in the truth. I was baptized when I was about 11 years old together with my father.

00:31:57.740 --> 00:32:05.740
And we had a very teocratic household my parents were very jealous in field service and they attended all the meetings.

00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:10.740
So we had a very good teocratic family a very warm nest in which we grew up.

00:32:10.740 --> 00:32:18.740
At the age of 20 I was called up for the military service. I refused so I had to go to prison.

00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:26.740
And I still remember when I came in the south and when I heard that heavy door close behind me.

00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:30.740
And then the key turned a few times in the lock.

00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:40.740
It stood there alone and in this first day when I was there I was wondering for myself why am I here?

00:32:40.740 --> 00:32:45.740
Am I just here to do what any other witness is doing or is it my personal decision?

00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:53.740
On the basis of my personal belief and I was really confronted with myself.

00:32:53.740 --> 00:33:06.019
For the first time in my life, conscientiously I had the feeling that I was doing something for Jehovah and that has strengthened my face.

00:33:06.019 --> 00:33:08.019
It was a turn point in my life.

00:33:08.019 --> 00:33:19.420
We became engaged when Willy was in prison and because at that time the watchtower publications were banned in prison.

00:33:19.420 --> 00:33:24.420
So I made hundred copies of the watchtower and I sent them to him.

00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:28.420
I sent her love letters and she sent me copies of the watchtower.

00:33:28.420 --> 00:33:42.759
When I was released from prison about two years later we married and then I could find a very well-paid job.

00:33:42.759 --> 00:33:46.759
And we had a beautiful house, we had a nice car or so.

00:33:46.759 --> 00:33:50.759
And it was my wish that Frida would not have to work secularly.

00:33:50.759 --> 00:33:55.759
And that was what was our aim, the future was ours.

00:33:55.759 --> 00:34:01.759
Shortly after our marriage we invited the circuit over here to have dinner with us.

00:34:01.759 --> 00:34:06.759
And during the meal he looked at us and he said,

00:34:06.759 --> 00:34:11.760
you have to tell me something, why are you not pioneering?

00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:15.760
That was a straight forward question.

00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:20.760
We couldn't answer, we didn't think about pioneering.

00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:24.760
I really don't know why we were not pioneering.

00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:31.619
As a young girl I always wanted to pioneer even become a missionary.

00:34:31.619 --> 00:34:35.619
I wanted to pioneer then but I couldn't.

00:34:35.619 --> 00:34:42.300
And now I could and I didn't do it.

00:34:42.300 --> 00:34:47.300
At that time we were thinking that we already did what was right.

00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:54.300
Besides being very jealous in the truth I tried to take care of my lovely wife as good as I could.

00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:58.300
But was it really the best way to take care of her?

00:34:58.300 --> 00:35:03.300
That same evening we prayed to Jehovah and we promised him that we would fully rely on him.

00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:09.300
According to Matthew 633 and that's what we did.

00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:15.300
That same week I resigned my job and we cancelled the rent of our house.

00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:22.300
And shortly thereafter we moved to a small apartment and then we started a new life pioneering.

00:35:22.300 --> 00:35:25.300
Of course we made some sacrifices.

00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:28.300
Our previous house had everything.

00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:33.300
Now a new apartment then we did not even have a shower.

00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:37.300
But we knew that we have made the right choice.

00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:43.300
Because from then on Jehovah was really providing for everything.

00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:47.840
We enjoyed very much serving Jehovah together.

00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:51.840
Four months later we were appointed as special pioneers.

00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:54.840
And after that many other privileges followed.

00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:58.840
We really had the privilege to attend Giliat school.

00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:03.840
He was invited without me of course and that was a sacrifice.

00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:11.840
But later I had the privilege to join Willy when he was visiting different branches over the world.

00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:13.840
That was really a blessing.

00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:20.119
Full-time service has given us really a meaningful life.

00:36:20.119 --> 00:36:27.119
It is a pleasure to realize that we use our strength to seek God's kingdom first.

00:36:27.119 --> 00:36:33.119
We are so happy that someone helped us to make the right choices right after our marriage.

00:36:33.119 --> 00:36:35.119
Jehovah has blessed us all the way.

00:36:35.119 --> 00:36:42.119
Looking back on these 47 years of full-time service, we feel that we have had a very rich spiritual life.

00:36:42.119 --> 00:36:46.119
We are so happy that we invited a circle over here for dinner that day.

00:36:46.119 --> 00:36:58.780
The gonos made the right choices and Jehovah rewarded them.

00:36:58.780 --> 00:37:01.780
But all of us face decisions every day.

00:37:01.780 --> 00:37:04.780
Some big, some small.

00:37:04.780 --> 00:37:09.780
Some seemingly small decisions may have big consequences.

00:37:09.780 --> 00:37:15.780
With that in mind, pay special attention to this morning worship program from Bethel

00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:21.780
that highlights the value of deciding to curb wrong desires immediately.

00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:26.780
And we said earlier that it sounds like we'll be talking about marriage.

00:37:26.780 --> 00:37:33.780
And so if you look at verse 6, you see our days text, what God has joked together, let no man put apart.

00:37:33.780 --> 00:37:37.780
But actually, if you look at verse 3, you'll see the topic was divorce.

00:37:37.780 --> 00:37:42.780
And Jesus used our days text to set the Pharisees straight on the matter of divorce.

00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:44.780
But then in verse 9, he said,

00:37:44.780 --> 00:37:53.780
I say to you that whoever divorces his wife except on the grounds of sexual immorality and marries another commits adultery.

00:37:53.780 --> 00:38:01.780
So since the topic is marriage and divorce, can our single brothers and sisters just tune out of our discussion?

00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:03.780
No.

00:38:03.780 --> 00:38:11.780
Sometimes the man who puts apart the yoke that God put together proves to be a single person.

00:38:11.780 --> 00:38:14.780
And so look at the first sentence in our Watchtower comments.

00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:21.780
It says, whether single or married, all of us need to bear in mind Jesus' words.

00:38:22.780 --> 00:38:27.780
Well, does coveting another's mate happen in the Christian congregation?

00:38:27.780 --> 00:38:29.780
Yes.

00:38:29.780 --> 00:38:31.780
How does it happen?

00:38:31.780 --> 00:38:34.780
Well, if you look at the third sentence in our Watchtower comments for today, it says,

00:38:34.780 --> 00:38:38.780
if any Christian begins to entertain, that's how it happens.

00:38:38.780 --> 00:38:41.780
Begins to entertain such a covetous desire.

00:38:41.780 --> 00:38:49.780
It says he should, here she should quickly route it out, the unclean desire, even at the cost of great emotional pain.

00:38:50.780 --> 00:38:52.780
Because in here again, how does it happen?

00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:57.780
Having allowed such selfish cravings to develop.

00:38:57.780 --> 00:39:08.119
Well, at the point described in our sentence here, the other person likely does not even realize that this person has covetous desire for them.

00:39:08.119 --> 00:39:12.119
The desire is just beginning to be entertained.

00:39:12.119 --> 00:39:15.119
And you notice a sentence did not say that he and she should route it out.

00:39:15.119 --> 00:39:19.119
It says he or she should act quickly.

00:39:19.119 --> 00:39:22.119
So it was a lone individual at this point.

00:39:22.119 --> 00:39:25.119
Well, how does this covetous desire begin?

00:39:25.119 --> 00:39:31.119
In the world, it could be at the first sighting of an attractive person, they instantly have a desire for more.

00:39:31.119 --> 00:39:35.119
But we have been groomed by Jehovah's word.

00:39:35.119 --> 00:39:38.119
We have a high regard for morality.

00:39:38.119 --> 00:39:47.119
So in the congregation, or even here at Bethel, the desire may develop not solely based on looks, but on emotional attachment.

00:39:47.119 --> 00:39:57.119
Usually, the breaking of the yoke of marriage occurs when a third party is spending a considerable amount of time with one of the mates.

00:39:57.119 --> 00:40:01.119
And we might mention that this is not necessarily with malicious intent.

00:40:01.119 --> 00:40:08.119
I just one scenario, a single pioneer brother and a married pioneer sister.

00:40:08.119 --> 00:40:15.119
Well, obviously, they're going to be spending more time together than if either one of them was not pioneering.

00:40:15.119 --> 00:40:18.119
And periodically, they'll be in the same car group.

00:40:18.119 --> 00:40:23.119
Over time, they get to know one another more.

00:40:23.119 --> 00:40:25.119
And this is just circumstances.

00:40:25.119 --> 00:40:38.119
But this can lead up to that third sentence in our comments where one of them, usually unbeknownst the other one, has began to entertain this covetous desire.

00:40:38.119 --> 00:40:40.119
He needs to route that out quickly.

00:40:40.119 --> 00:40:50.119
Otherwise, there is a whole series of sad events that could be launched that potentially could end up with the married sister divorced.

00:40:50.119 --> 00:40:59.119
Well, this same progression can happen here at Bethel, too, if a brother and sister work together day after day.

00:40:59.119 --> 00:41:02.119
Open, please, the Colossians three, five now.

00:41:02.119 --> 00:41:07.119
Our watch star comment said route out the desire. Colossians says dead in the desire.

00:41:07.119 --> 00:41:12.119
But notice what happens if we do not quickly route out the desire.

00:41:12.119 --> 00:41:15.119
Colossians three, five.

00:41:15.119 --> 00:41:26.119
It says dead in, dead in, therefore, your body members that are on the earth as respects one sexual immorality to uncleanest, uncontrolled sexual passion, hurtful desire, and greediness.

00:41:26.119 --> 00:41:29.119
It says all of which is idolatry.

00:41:29.119 --> 00:41:36.119
Well, the five inappropriate steps listed there seem to be in the order of gravity with the most serious being first.

00:41:36.119 --> 00:41:40.119
Look at the fifth one, greediness.

00:41:40.119 --> 00:41:44.119
Now, our previous edition used the word covetousness there.

00:41:44.119 --> 00:41:49.119
But really, the fundamental issue is greed.

00:41:49.119 --> 00:41:55.119
Look one step back, hurtful, or we could say covetous desire.

00:41:55.119 --> 00:42:01.119
Well, if we do not route it out immediately at the start of that stage, what develops further.

00:42:01.119 --> 00:42:05.119
Another step back, it says uncontrolled sexual passion.

00:42:05.119 --> 00:42:12.400
And if we do not dead at that point, go one step back, uncleanest.

00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:15.400
You see, now something physical has occurred between the two already.

00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:18.400
Not fornication, but uncleanest.

00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:24.400
And if we do not check it at that point, the most serious will occur.

00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:29.400
Sexual immorality with the potential of breaking the one flesh bond.

00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:35.400
Well, we want our brothers and sisters to continue to pioneer together single and married.

00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:43.400
And it's impossible to adjust the circumstances of Bethel so that our brother and sister never work together.

00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:51.400
So how can we all protect ourselves from allowing this wrong desire to develop?

00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:54.400
Please turn to Job 31.

00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:58.400
We've considered these series of verses before, but it's so pertinent to this discussion.

00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:02.400
Let's be reminded of it, Job 31.

00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:08.400
We call Job the integrity keeper rightly so, but he was an imperfect integrity keeper.

00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:14.400
He evidently had some thoughts and desires that troubled him.

00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:20.400
Well, what did he do to quickly route out that desire, not allowed to develop further?

00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:23.400
Job 31 is our familiar one.

00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:29.400
I have made a covenant with my eye, so how could I show my show improper attention to a virgin?

00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:31.400
Well, what's your place there?

00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:39.400
But why would Job be moved to make a contract not to look at a woman with improper desire?

00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:43.400
He must have been aware of some temptations within himself.

00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:48.400
And so he took this strong measure to avoid it developing further.

00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:51.400
We start to entertain a wrong desire, what should we do?

00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:56.400
And I might mention this works for those who've had a problem with pornography.

00:43:56.400 --> 00:44:01.400
Why not type up a contract with your eyes, sign it, and date it?

00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:05.400
Put it in your wallet or next to the computer and review it periodically?

00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:12.400
And then if you succumb to the desire again, save that contract, but type up another one, sign it, and date it.

00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:20.400
You see, in time we can compare the duration between the contract dates and we can monitor our progress.

00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:23.400
Well, hurtful desire leads to more and more depravity.

00:44:23.400 --> 00:44:25.400
And that's the series of verses here in 31.

00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:26.400
Look at verse 3.

00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:29.400
Did Job realize this series of events?

00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:34.400
3. Does not disaster await the wrongdoer and calamity of those doing what is harmful?

00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:37.400
Verse 4, he knew he could not hide anything from Jehovah.

00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:40.400
6 is powerful. He realized this is an issue of integrity.

00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:42.400
Let God weigh me in accurate scales.

00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:45.400
Then he will recognize my integrity.

00:44:45.400 --> 00:44:48.400
Wrong desire. Is that serious?

00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:52.400
He also realized that looking at entices the heart in a wrong direction.

00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:59.400
Verse 7, if my footsteps deviate from the way where my heart has followed after my eyes.

00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:03.400
And verse 9, you see, on the same subject as verse 1,

00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:06.400
if my heart has been enticed by a woman.

00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:11.400
And what would be the consequences of this progression of events?

00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:14.400
A judicial case.

00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:22.400
Look at verse 11, for that would be shameful conduct and an error deserving punishment by the judges.

00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:31.900
So in summary, what God has joked together, let no man put apart.

00:45:32.900 --> 00:45:34.900
That was good counsel for all of us.

00:45:34.900 --> 00:45:42.900
And don't forget that you can also find additional morning worship programs on the programs and events channel.

00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:50.900
At the 2013 regional conventions, we all received the touching video, The Particle Returns.

00:45:50.900 --> 00:45:55.900
Have you ever wondered what is involved in producing one of the organization's videos?

00:45:55.900 --> 00:46:00.900
If you go to the Our Activities channel on JW Broadcasting,

00:46:00.900 --> 00:46:06.900
you'll find a documentary that will take you behind the scenes of The Particle Returns.

00:46:06.900 --> 00:46:15.900
We are so well cared for spiritually with the many publications we receive and the congregation meetings on a weekly basis.

00:46:15.900 --> 00:46:20.900
And how much we appreciate the governing body adjusting our meeting times

00:46:20.900 --> 00:46:27.900
so that we can spend an evening each week in personal study or if we're married in family worship.

00:46:27.900 --> 00:46:33.900
When there are children involved, the spiritual head of the family is encouraged to be innovative

00:46:33.900 --> 00:46:38.900
and make the time spent interesting for those of varying ages.

00:46:38.900 --> 00:46:42.900
But what if it's just you and your marriage mate?

00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:47.900
Watch this interesting portrayal of the circumstances faced by a married couple?

00:46:47.900 --> 00:46:54.050
Change. It happens all the time in life.

00:46:54.050 --> 00:47:00.380
How we adapt to change isn't always easy.

00:47:00.380 --> 00:47:05.380
As a family, we've always tried to put Jehovah in his will first.

00:47:05.380 --> 00:47:09.380
And now it's time for change again.

00:47:09.380 --> 00:47:11.380
Let me explain.

00:47:11.380 --> 00:47:17.659
Family worship has always been an important part of our spiritual routine.

00:47:17.659 --> 00:47:21.659
Studying with our children came naturally.

00:47:21.659 --> 00:47:28.659
It just flowed and we enjoyed it.

00:47:28.659 --> 00:47:39.519
But when the last of our children moved out, we just hit a wall.

00:47:39.519 --> 00:47:44.829
I was finding it awkward to study with my wife alone.

00:47:44.829 --> 00:48:06.480
Our family worship was becoming nothing more than a stale question and answer session.

00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:19.420
And gradually, it got worse.

00:48:19.420 --> 00:48:34.230
Until finally, we stopped altogether.

00:48:34.230 --> 00:48:39.900
Sometimes with change, we just need a wake-up call.

00:48:39.900 --> 00:48:52.119
I had almost forgotten how deep a student of the Bible she is.

00:48:52.119 --> 00:49:09.360
How could I make our family worship more enjoyable for her, for myself, for both of us?

00:49:09.360 --> 00:49:11.360
I had to do something.

00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:22.409
The faithful slave has always encouraged husbands to study with their wives.

00:49:22.409 --> 00:49:30.989
I've meditated on 1 Peter the 3rd chapter, verse 7, where it says,

00:49:30.989 --> 00:49:34.989
You husbands continue dwelling with them according to knowledge.

00:49:34.989 --> 00:49:36.989
Assign them on.

00:49:36.989 --> 00:49:44.030
I reflected on the example of Abraham and Sarah.

00:49:44.030 --> 00:49:50.030
At one point, Abraham had to adjust and pay attention to his wife's feelings.

00:49:50.030 --> 00:49:54.030
In fact, Jehovah said, listen to her.

00:49:54.030 --> 00:49:57.820
Was I listening?

00:49:57.820 --> 00:50:27.340
Like Abraham and Sarah, it was time for us to have a heart to heart.

00:50:38.579 --> 00:50:44.579
I let her know that her feelings really mattered to me and that with a little creativity

00:50:44.579 --> 00:50:48.579
and finding material that would interest both of us.

00:50:48.579 --> 00:50:50.579
Our studies could be more enjoyable.

00:50:50.579 --> 00:51:27.880
We decided to make a new start.

00:51:27.880 --> 00:51:32.880
Family worship is taken on a fresh and exciting new role in our marriage.

00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:35.880
In fact, it is the highlight of our week.

00:51:35.880 --> 00:52:02.530
A variety to our studies.

00:52:02.530 --> 00:52:04.530
They are now more rich.

00:52:04.530 --> 00:52:07.530
Meaningful and engaging.

00:52:07.530 --> 00:52:18.719
Yes, change can bring about new challenges.

00:52:18.719 --> 00:52:23.769
But it also creates new opportunities.

00:52:23.769 --> 00:52:30.210
Together, we are drawing closer to each other and to Jehovah.

00:52:30.210 --> 00:52:42.420
Did you notice how the brother took firm action when he noticed that an adjustment was needed

00:52:42.420 --> 00:52:46.420
in their method of worshiping together as a married couple?

00:52:46.420 --> 00:52:51.420
He researched the matter and put effort into making it come alive.

00:52:51.420 --> 00:52:55.420
A great example for all of us to follow if we detect our methods

00:52:55.420 --> 00:53:01.110
and not stimulating the mind and heart of each other.

00:53:01.110 --> 00:53:04.110
The closer we get to the end of the system of things,

00:53:04.110 --> 00:53:10.110
the more we need to keep in mind how Jehovah always cares for his people.

00:53:10.110 --> 00:53:15.110
For example, think about Jesus' words in Luke 21 verse 11.

00:53:15.110 --> 00:53:19.110
He said, there will be great earthquakes

00:53:19.110 --> 00:53:25.110
and in one place after another, food shortages and pestilences.

00:53:25.110 --> 00:53:28.110
If you have been affected by a disaster,

00:53:28.110 --> 00:53:32.110
rest assured that Jehovah knows what you are going through

00:53:32.110 --> 00:53:37.110
and that his organization will do all it can to provide help.

00:53:37.110 --> 00:53:41.110
And that is the theme of this music video.

00:53:41.110 --> 00:53:43.110
We won't forget you.

00:53:43.110 --> 00:57:20.420
It has been a pleasure to have you with us for our November program.

00:57:21.420 --> 00:57:25.420
As highlighted, Jehovah is doing his part in providing for

00:57:25.420 --> 00:57:29.420
theocratic education, translation into hundreds of languages

00:57:29.420 --> 00:57:34.420
and motivating us to do what we can in his service.

00:57:34.420 --> 00:57:39.420
Even if we personally are not presently in a position to move to another country

00:57:39.420 --> 00:57:41.420
or even to another congregation,

00:57:41.420 --> 00:57:46.420
the examples we have seen today highlight one important thing

00:57:46.420 --> 00:57:51.420
that we always do our best in Jehovah's service.

00:57:51.420 --> 00:57:55.420
First Timothy 4 and verse 10 assures us,

00:57:55.420 --> 00:57:59.420
this is why we are working hard and exerting ourselves

00:57:59.420 --> 00:58:03.420
because we have rested our hope on a living God

00:58:03.420 --> 00:58:09.420
who is a savior of all sorts of men, especially of faithful ones.

00:58:09.420 --> 00:58:14.420
Yes, our objective is to be viewed as faithful ones by Jehovah.

00:58:15.420 --> 00:58:19.420
Only then can we have a lasting hope for the future,

00:58:19.420 --> 00:58:26.420
knowing that he will provide a strength both now and to all eternity.

00:58:26.420 --> 00:58:29.420
We'd like to conclude the program with these pictures

00:58:29.420 --> 00:58:33.420
from what will soon become the new world headquarters

00:58:33.420 --> 00:58:35.420
in Warwick, New York.

00:58:35.420 --> 00:58:39.420
Over 1,500 brothers and sisters are working their every day

00:58:39.420 --> 00:58:41.420
in its construction.

00:58:41.420 --> 00:58:46.420
I'm sure that they all agree that it is Jehovah who is taking the lead.

00:58:46.420 --> 00:58:55.059
Until next time, this is JW Broadcasting in Brooklyn, New York.
