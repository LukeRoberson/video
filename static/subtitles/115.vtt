WEBVTT

00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:26.000
We are happy to welcome you to JW Broadcasting for June 2024.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.899
On March 9, 2024, students from around the world were delighted to graduate from the

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:33.740
155th class of Gilead.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:41.539
The students came from five continents, represented more than 20 countries and spoke over 35 languages.

00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:45.740
What parting encouragement did members of the governing body, the Gilead instructors

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.299
and others give to the graduates?

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:51.100
What intriguing talk themes were developed?

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.340
Which countries were featured in the latest edition of the Inside Story?

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.060
Let's find out.

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.899
Enjoy Part 1.

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:04.459
Well you seem excited and you should be, and we're happy for you.

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:10.420
The graduation program today will benefit every listener, but even so, please know that

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.900
this program has been prepared with your class in mind.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.659
And the day is over, you'll look back and recall a program that honored Jehovah and that

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:25.780
confirmed his love for you, as well as our love for you.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.659
During the past five months of your schooling, you were asked to draw out important Bible

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.420
principles from many different accounts, true?

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.959
And so many of those accounts focused on servants of God who, with his help, will they

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:43.579
succeed in doing his will?

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:47.819
And you know, Dad, agree more than ever before with what the Apostle Paul wrote at Philippians

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:54.180
413, where he said, for all things, I have this strength through the one who gives me power.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.659
And you know who that one is, Jehovah.

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:01.420
And he provides that power for us by means of his son, and he gave you the power to succeed

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.219
in this school, and you did.

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.299
And that's a blessing you must never forget.

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:10.939
He helped you, and he will always help you.

00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:15.819
For example, in the future, when you face a task or challenge that seems very large, very

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:21.379
daunting, you can remember how he helped you at this time.

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:25.180
Keep in mind scriptural examples like David.

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:31.139
From his youth, David remembered his need for Jehovah's help, didn't he?

00:02:31.139 --> 00:02:38.340
At Psalm 71, verses 5 and 17, he said, for your my hope, O sovereign Lord Jehovah, I have

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.939
trusted in you since my youth.

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:46.580
You've taught me from my youth, and until now I keep declaring your wonderful works.

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.900
Well, isn't that how you feel as Jehovah has helped you along through the years?

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:58.060
And now as he has helped you, you through this schooling, and you're at the point of graduation.

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.979
And what a thrilling day it is for you, one that you will never forget.

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:06.860
So like David, he had the gratitude to remember Jehovah's help.

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:07.860
So do we.

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:14.699
David had the faith to trust in Jehovah's help, and so do we, and we see those good qualities

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:17.580
in you, and we love you for it.

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:24.139
That's why you're confident to face whatever things are ahead of you as well.

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:27.460
So use your Gilead training in the branches where you will serve.

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:32.860
Jehovah will love you for it, and the dear brothers and sisters will absolutely love

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.740
you for it.

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:40.620
So now we're going to enjoy a series of encouraging talks that for all of us, as mentioned earlier,

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:47.900
will strengthen our faith, build up our trusting God, and highlight the wonderful purpose, his

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.219
wonderful purpose that we support.

00:03:51.219 --> 00:03:56.939
So first of all, on the program, let's give our attention to brother Jonathan Smith.

00:03:56.939 --> 00:04:03.659
He serves as a helper to the service committee who will discuss the theme, what do I need

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:06.580
to do?

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.219
What do I need to do?

00:04:09.219 --> 00:04:11.180
Have you ever asked yourself that question?

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:17.620
Well, if you're like me, you ask yourself that question every day, sometimes several times

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:18.620
a day.

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.459
What do I need to do next?

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:24.980
But there's a little bit more to that question, and maybe you haven't asked yourself this

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:26.420
in a while.

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:32.860
What do I need to do to inherit everlasting life?

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:37.420
And maybe that's a question you asked when you were first studying the Bible, and rightly

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:43.220
so, or maybe during your course of your Gilead training, you asked yourself that question

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.819
a number of times.

00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:52.899
Well in the Bible, there were two men who asked Jesus that same exact question.

00:04:52.899 --> 00:05:00.259
Both of them asked Jesus the question in the last six months of Jesus' earthly ministry.

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:04.259
So it was the same question, the answers were different.

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:14.660
Let's look at the first one, Luke 10 and verse 25.

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:19.740
Now look, a man, verse in the law, stood up to test him and said, teacher, what do I need

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:23.699
to do to inherit everlasting life?

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:28.699
Well Jesus very astutely understands that this man is already versed in the law.

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:35.220
He probably already has an idea, but it seems his motive may be more to test Jesus than

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:37.379
get an answer.

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:39.939
So what does Jesus do?

00:05:39.939 --> 00:05:45.259
Jesus lets him answer his own question in verse 26.

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:46.620
What is written in the law?

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:48.860
How do you read?

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:53.819
In verse 27, the man gives an amazing answer.

00:05:53.819 --> 00:06:01.540
From one sentence, this man sums up the entire mosaic law.

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:09.660
He does it exactly the same way that Jesus had done so on two different occasions.

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:12.779
Well, Jesus, no doubt impressed.

00:06:12.779 --> 00:06:16.660
He said to him in verse 28, you answered correctly, keep doing that.

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:20.019
You'll get life.

00:06:20.019 --> 00:06:21.339
Good lessons here for us.

00:06:21.339 --> 00:06:25.660
When we're talking with people about the Bible and our ministry, sometimes we may detect

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:29.699
they have a little knowledge, flip the question back to them.

00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:30.699
What do you think?

00:06:30.699 --> 00:06:33.540
Or better yet, what do you read?

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:38.019
Another thing we can do is found in verse 28, commend a person if they give a correct

00:06:38.019 --> 00:06:39.939
response.

00:06:39.939 --> 00:06:44.339
Let them know that you think everlasting life is within their reach.

00:06:44.339 --> 00:06:48.060
But this man has another motive surface now.

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:52.860
He moves from testing Jesus to wanting to prove himself righteous.

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:56.819
In verse 29, he says, who really is my neighbor?

00:06:56.819 --> 00:07:00.540
Now being Jewish and versed in the law, he's already got an idea on this one, too, doesn't

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:01.860
he?

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:06.060
He's probably thinking, Jesus is going to tell me what I want to hear.

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:11.420
That neighbors are my Jewish friends, perhaps in my village, especially those who follow

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:13.220
the law.

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:17.540
Well, if so, that question would be a little limiting, wouldn't it?

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:19.220
Who really is my neighbor?

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:23.420
Isn't really the best question.

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:28.819
So how does Jesus get around this motive that he's got of proving himself righteous and

00:07:28.819 --> 00:07:31.540
yet correct his viewpoint on a neighbor?

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:36.019
Well, as you know, there's a beautiful parable here, the neighbor, Lee Samaritan, where

00:07:36.019 --> 00:07:42.259
Jesus describes a situation here in verse 30, 31, 32, man is going down from Jerusalem

00:07:42.259 --> 00:07:48.259
to Jericho, falls victim to robbers, they strip him, beat him, leave him half dead.

00:07:48.259 --> 00:07:55.220
But by coincidence, a priest goes down that road, but passes by on the opposite side.

00:07:55.220 --> 00:08:00.459
The same thing happens with a Levite, passes by on the opposite side.

00:08:00.459 --> 00:08:05.220
These are men who have responsible positions in God's organization.

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:08.740
How callous, how insensitive.

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:10.860
Good lesson here for us.

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:15.180
We may have responsible assignments and Jehovah's organization.

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:21.100
Never allow that to cause us to become callous to another person's needs, even putting

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:26.259
our downtime, so to speak, ahead of caring for someone.

00:08:26.259 --> 00:08:31.660
Well, you'll notice the Samaritan is very different, 33, 34.

00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:36.700
He's traveling this road, he's moved with pity, he approaches him, bandages the wounds,

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:40.700
pours oil and wine on them, mounts the poor man on his own animal, brings him to an

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:44.779
inn, takes care of him, evidently all that day.

00:08:44.779 --> 00:08:52.659
The next day, verse 35, he takes out two denariah, two days wages, gives them to the innkeeper,

00:08:52.659 --> 00:09:00.100
says, take care of him, whatever you spend besides this, I will repay you when I return.

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:05.379
Two days wages evidently, he spent everything that he had, because he was going to have

00:09:05.379 --> 00:09:09.980
to come back to give the innkeeper more.

00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:16.899
Well, for a man who was a Jew, who would likely under normal circumstances, not even greet

00:09:16.899 --> 00:09:18.220
him.

00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:27.419
Well, Jesus then asked another question, but this time Jesus changes the man's question.

00:09:27.419 --> 00:09:34.700
Not who is my neighbor, but who of these three seems to you to have made himself neighbor

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:38.539
to the man who fell victim to the robbers?

00:09:38.539 --> 00:09:41.620
Isn't that a better question?

00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:43.419
It isn't who is my neighbor.

00:09:43.419 --> 00:09:47.019
How can I make myself a neighbor?

00:09:47.019 --> 00:09:51.620
Well the man gets the point, and he answers correctly again.

00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:59.059
He doesn't say Samaritan, maybe he can't go that far, but he says the one who acted mercifully.

00:09:59.059 --> 00:10:08.659
Now Jesus says, go and do the same yourself, and the account ends there on a positive note.

00:10:08.659 --> 00:10:14.899
Well, we learned a lot of, don't we, about talking with people in our ministry, and even

00:10:14.899 --> 00:10:21.259
in our day-to-day conversations at work with our brothers and sisters, when others have

00:10:21.259 --> 00:10:25.340
a question, never belittle the question, right?

00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:29.059
Only help them to come to the right conclusion.

00:10:29.059 --> 00:10:35.460
We never want to criticize someone for a motive that may not be the best, just kindly respond.

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:39.820
Maybe a parable, an illustration, will help them get the point.

00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:45.899
Well, now, this isn't the only time Jesus had to deal with that question, as I mentioned,

00:10:45.899 --> 00:10:53.860
let's go to another occasion, and this time we're going to go to Luke 18 and verse 18.

00:10:53.860 --> 00:11:01.740
And here, we find that this man is not well-versed in the law, but he's a ruler, and the Bible says

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:10.539
that he's very rich, and in another gospel, it also says he's young, rich, and young,

00:11:10.539 --> 00:11:11.539
and a ruler.

00:11:11.539 --> 00:11:18.080
Not always the best combination, but notice here in verse 18, this conversation starts

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:23.679
with him running up to Jesus, unbended knee, good teacher, what must I do to inherit

00:11:23.679 --> 00:11:24.679
every lasting life?

00:11:24.679 --> 00:11:28.000
Well, Jesus can't let this one go.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000
You don't want to call Jesus something that should be only true of Jehovah.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.240
That is a title of being a good teacher.

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:39.960
So he gives him a gentle correction there in verse 19, and then in verse 20, Jesus describes

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:44.519
of course, explains some of the ten commandments.

00:11:44.519 --> 00:11:49.960
But the man in verse 21 says, all these have capped from my youth on.

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:56.399
In other words, what else am I lacking?

00:11:56.399 --> 00:12:03.360
Well after hearing this, Jesus acknowledges there actually is something lacking.

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:09.320
And verse 22, one thing, sell all the things you have, distribute the proceeds to the poor.

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:15.080
You will have treasure in the heavens and come be my follower.

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:19.639
Well, that's almost too much for him to take.

00:12:19.639 --> 00:12:26.960
And Mark's account, it tells us at this point that Jesus felt love for the man because

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:30.759
he clearly saw that he was sincere.

00:12:30.759 --> 00:12:36.759
But although he was sincere in his question, he couldn't do it, could he?

00:12:36.759 --> 00:12:41.440
When he heard this, he became deeply grieved for he was very rich.

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:45.399
Mark says he had many possessions.

00:12:45.399 --> 00:12:48.279
Well we learn a few things from this parable, don't we?

00:12:48.279 --> 00:12:54.600
We learn that sometimes people that have good motives don't always have good qualities.

00:12:54.600 --> 00:13:01.639
In this case, he was simply too attached to his things and that prevented him from gaining

00:13:01.639 --> 00:13:07.279
one of the best privileges he could have possibly had in following Jesus.

00:13:07.279 --> 00:13:10.879
So from these two accounts, we learned some things.

00:13:10.879 --> 00:13:16.120
First of all, we learned that we can learn from a Samaritan.

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:19.360
Have you ever learned from a Samaritan?

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:20.919
I know I have.

00:13:20.919 --> 00:13:25.519
One day many years ago I was driving down the road and I had a flat tire and I had a spare

00:13:25.519 --> 00:13:29.240
tire but the tools I didn't have.

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:34.080
So this is before the days of cell phones, I walked up to the nearest house, I said, can

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:39.919
I use your phone, please, to call a tow truck and the man said, well why, I need to change

00:13:39.919 --> 00:13:40.919
my tire.

00:13:40.919 --> 00:13:42.600
He says, I'll help you.

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:48.720
He comes out of his house, gets his tools and in no time changes my tire.

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:54.000
As he's doing so, I'm thinking to myself, he's of another religion, he's of another culture,

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.919
another racial background, he's changing my tire.

00:13:57.919 --> 00:14:04.559
As I'm driving away, I'm thinking, Jehovah taught me something today from a Samaritan.

00:14:04.559 --> 00:14:06.720
So what do we learn?

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:12.039
It's not such a bad idea, occasionally, to ask this question, is it?

00:14:12.039 --> 00:14:19.200
Two men were wise to do so, unfortunately at least one of them didn't follow through.

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:25.240
But occasionally, if we say to Jehovah, please, what do I need to do to inherit everlasting

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:26.240
life?

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:30.320
We can be sure that Jehovah will answer that prayer, maybe through personal study or

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:34.759
Bible reading, or it might even be through Samaritan.

00:14:34.759 --> 00:14:54.500
Well, we thank you very much, Brother Smith, for that warm and practical talk.

00:14:54.500 --> 00:15:00.059
Let's now give our attention to Brother Paul Gillies, who serves as a helper to the coordinators

00:15:00.059 --> 00:15:07.600
committee, who will discuss the theme, the gift of God.

00:15:07.639 --> 00:15:12.440
Jehovah is the most generous person in the universe.

00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:17.200
He is the giver of every good and every perfect present.

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:23.960
And no doubt, you Gillied students have thanked Jehovah many times for the numerous spiritual

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:29.360
gifts that you have received over the past five months.

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:36.720
I recall what one of you said in your introduction, Gillied is an undeserved gift.

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:41.399
What I would like to ask you now is, have you experienced over these five months the gift

00:15:41.399 --> 00:15:48.440
of God that's mentioned in Ecclesiastes chapter 3 and verses 12 and 13?

00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:51.440
Let's have a look at these verses together.

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:56.549
Ecclesiastes 3, 12 and 13.

00:15:56.549 --> 00:16:03.149
I have concluded that there is nothing better for them than to rejoice and to do good during

00:16:03.149 --> 00:16:04.990
their life.

00:16:04.990 --> 00:16:10.789
Also that everyone should eat and drink and find enjoyment for all his hard work.

00:16:10.789 --> 00:16:14.750
It is the gift of God.

00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:20.309
So this verse offers a very simple formula for enjoying life, if we are blessed with good

00:16:20.309 --> 00:16:21.309
health.

00:16:21.309 --> 00:16:28.429
There is nothing better than to eat and drink and find enjoyment for hard work.

00:16:28.429 --> 00:16:30.230
Why is that?

00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:34.389
Because it is the gift of God.

00:16:34.389 --> 00:16:40.590
Now as explained in verse 12, the work which produces feelings of enjoyment and satisfaction

00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:44.029
is, you know, to do good.

00:16:44.029 --> 00:16:48.590
That is, good deeds on behalf of others.

00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:56.509
As Jesus said, there is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving.

00:16:56.509 --> 00:17:03.789
Verse 8, verse 30, also tells us that as a master worker, Jesus rejoiced.

00:17:03.789 --> 00:17:08.829
Or as the Hebrew word for rejoice implies, he had a good time.

00:17:08.829 --> 00:17:17.430
Yes, he had a good time working with his father over billions of years, creating the universe.

00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:22.950
Now we may be a long way from being blessed as a master worker.

00:17:22.950 --> 00:17:29.589
But all can enjoy the satisfaction that comes from doing good work in Jehovah's service.

00:17:29.589 --> 00:17:35.069
And don't you find that it is this feeling itself that is a gift from God.

00:17:35.069 --> 00:17:46.309
Now if you turn with me to Ecclesiastes chapter 5, verses 18 and 19 expands on this thought.

00:17:47.109 --> 00:17:56.309
This is what I have seen to be good and proper, that one should eat and drink and find enjoyment

00:17:56.309 --> 00:18:01.910
for all the hard work at which he toils under the sun during the few days of life that the

00:18:01.910 --> 00:18:07.990
true God has given him, for that is his reward.

00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:14.470
Also, when the true God gives a man riches and material possessions along with the ability

00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:23.990
to enjoy them, he should take his reward and rejoice in his hard work, this is the gift of God.

00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:30.390
Now in effect, the Bible writer wisely recommends two things here.

00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:40.150
One, work diligently from day to day and two, enjoy what you have right now.

00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:47.670
Now when we recognize that our prosperity is a gift from God, we get a lot of personal

00:18:47.670 --> 00:18:55.269
enjoyment from what we possess. And you notice that twice in these verses, this gift of God is

00:18:55.269 --> 00:19:02.950
described as a reward from Jehovah to us. Is that a beautiful thought that Jehovah chooses to

00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:09.509
reward us for our hard work? And I'm sure you agree that Gilead has added an abundance of

00:19:09.509 --> 00:19:17.349
spiritual treasures to your possessions. In the coming years, you will find enjoyment again and

00:19:17.349 --> 00:19:24.630
again when you recall an explanation of a verse that you discovered during your personal study,

00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:29.029
or that you gleaned from one of your instructors during a class lesson.

00:19:30.549 --> 00:19:35.750
Like travelers abroad, you have collected priceless souvenirs.

00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:43.589
Now if you're still in Ecclesiastes 5, let's have a look at verse 20, because this verse explains

00:19:43.589 --> 00:19:51.990
how the gift of God can affect our outlook on life. It says, for he will hardly notice, or as the

00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:59.670
footnote says, remember, he will hardly notice the passing days of his life, because the true God

00:19:59.670 --> 00:20:09.269
keeps him preoccupied with the rejoicing of his heart. Time flies is a very common refrain here

00:20:09.269 --> 00:20:18.150
at Bethel. And isn't that so true when we enjoy our work? We hardly notice that our days, weeks,

00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:29.269
years, even life itself seems to fly by. Therefore the advice is, save the moment. As one famous quote

00:20:29.269 --> 00:20:38.069
says, yesterday's the past, tomorrow's the future, but today is a gift, and that is why they call

00:20:38.069 --> 00:20:51.880
it the present. And there are benefits to being busy. The gift of God can help us to protect our

00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:59.160
mental well-being. When we are preoccupied with interesting work, we don't become unjuly concerned

00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:07.160
with the brevity of life and its problems and uncertainties. Rather, we get so much enjoyment from

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:15.240
doing good, like Jesus having a good time, that the negative aspects of life tend not to dominate

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:24.119
our thinking. You see, we become joyful at heart. So enjoy that feeling. It is a gift from God.

00:21:24.759 --> 00:21:32.359
Now, the past 20 weeks of schooling was hard work, wasn't it? Your minds were stretched,

00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:39.880
yet hasn't time flown by since you introduced yourselves to us on November the 6th last year.

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:48.279
Well, now it's time to relax, to eat and drink, in moderation, of course, with your family and

00:21:48.279 --> 00:21:56.759
friends as you reflect on your gillied experience. So now's the time to savor the reward from Jehovah.

00:21:58.519 --> 00:22:03.319
The same wise writer also suggested a good balance between work and rest,

00:22:03.319 --> 00:22:11.240
when he wrote at Ecclesiastes 4vs6. Better is a handful of rest than two handfuls of hard work.

00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:18.839
Now think about that. A workaholic has no time or energy left to participate in

00:22:18.839 --> 00:22:26.920
restful activities that are designed to refresh and rejuvenate us. So we have to be modest about work,

00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:33.480
especially when we really love our assignments. The Bible encourages a balanced view,

00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:41.960
work hard and enjoy the rewards. We may thoroughly enjoy our work,

00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:48.599
but we must remember that work is even more enjoyable if we take time to relax and reflect

00:22:48.599 --> 00:22:56.440
with pleasure on that work. Now since it's likely that many of you will receive new and enjoyable

00:22:56.440 --> 00:23:02.759
privileges, which will increase your workload, this is good and timely advice from the scriptures,

00:23:02.759 --> 00:23:10.359
is it not? Now may I invite you to turn to 2 Timothy chapter 1 and verse 6.

00:23:12.279 --> 00:23:17.319
Because this verse conveys another positive dimension to the expression,

00:23:17.319 --> 00:23:23.400
the gift of God, as you look to future assignments. It says,

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:31.079
for this reason I remind you to stir up like a fire, the gift of God that is in you through the

00:23:31.079 --> 00:23:37.880
laying of my hands on you. Now if you to look at the study note, it says this,

00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:44.759
the gift that Paul here mentions seems to involve a gift of Holy Spirit,

00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:52.359
the imparting to Timothy of some special ability that helped him to fulfill his assignment.

00:23:53.799 --> 00:24:00.039
Now of course, Gilead students do not have scholastic abilities conferred upon them by God,

00:24:00.039 --> 00:24:04.119
do they? One of you even said in your introduction,

00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:12.599
we're just ordinary battle lights, living extraordinary lives. Now while that may be true,

00:24:13.559 --> 00:24:20.839
nevertheless, Gilead training has perhaps helped you to discover and nurture hidden talents

00:24:20.839 --> 00:24:27.000
that you never knew you had. True? Your instructors may have noticed if you didn't.

00:24:30.250 --> 00:24:36.569
All of us who enjoy service privileges like Timothy need to treasure our gift of God.

00:24:37.529 --> 00:24:45.130
Service privileges are expressions of Jehovah's undeserved kindness, not a reward for months of study.

00:24:46.490 --> 00:24:52.970
In fact, all of our energies, our abilities, our talents may be viewed as gifts from Jehovah

00:24:53.130 --> 00:25:01.130
and they have the purpose of doing good towards other people. Now if that's our outlook and that's

00:25:01.130 --> 00:25:09.289
our motive, we will thoroughly enjoy our assignments. You notice too in this verse that Paul reminded

00:25:09.289 --> 00:25:17.690
Timothy to stir up like a fire, the gift of God that was in him. No doubt you are fired up

00:25:18.170 --> 00:25:25.210
and you are ready to work hard in your assignments. But again, as explained in the study note,

00:25:25.210 --> 00:25:34.730
stirring up like a fire implies continuous action as one scholar suggests to keep the fire burning

00:25:34.730 --> 00:25:43.930
at full flame. So we're encouraged to put our heart and energy into our assignments. Be fired up

00:25:44.809 --> 00:25:52.809
but don't burn out. The fire will continue to burn at full flame if we always remember to balance

00:25:52.809 --> 00:26:03.450
work and rest. So yes, the days of our life quickly pass. It's a fact of life now, but only for now.

00:26:04.329 --> 00:26:12.009
In the new world, we will enjoy work to the full. The joy of living will get better and better,

00:26:12.009 --> 00:26:17.769
especially when we're in perfect health. We will enjoy the pleasure also of consuming

00:26:17.769 --> 00:26:27.049
unpolluted food and drink. So enjoy life. Enjoy life with your family and friends. Enjoy all that

00:26:27.049 --> 00:26:35.529
you have now. Enjoy your assignments. Put your heart into them. But be balanced. The simple formula

00:26:35.609 --> 00:26:43.369
from Ecclesiastes will carry on for billions and billions of years, even forever. Eat and drink

00:26:44.089 --> 00:26:50.329
and find enjoyment for all your hard work because it is the gift of God.

00:27:02.809 --> 00:27:09.609
Well, thank you very much, Brother Gillies. We certainly view that talk as a gift or present.

00:27:09.609 --> 00:27:17.289
We appreciate it. Now, Brother Edward Algin, who works in the writing department, will present

00:27:17.289 --> 00:27:26.630
the next part entitled a problem and a solution. Well, you brothers and sisters from the

00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:32.150
155th class of Gilead are not only about to graduate, but will soon be heading toward your

00:27:32.150 --> 00:27:40.470
assignments, which we know you'll enjoy. But life, being what it is, you know, problems occasionally

00:27:40.549 --> 00:27:47.349
arise. And one problem you might personally encounter somewhere down the road is difficulty

00:27:47.349 --> 00:27:55.750
understanding and adjustment to an organizational or theocratic arrangement. It could be a change in

00:27:55.750 --> 00:28:04.309
our preaching methods or in congregation operations or in branch procedures or something like that.

00:28:04.309 --> 00:28:11.829
Now, normally, we appreciate these organizational refinements and harmony with Isaiah 67. And yet

00:28:11.829 --> 00:28:19.190
our publications and even the Bible itself acknowledge that at some point any one of us might find

00:28:19.190 --> 00:28:26.869
it hard to make that transition from the way we had been doing something to the way we're now

00:28:26.869 --> 00:28:32.470
instructed to do it. Now, why would we find it difficult? Because it affects us personally,

00:28:33.269 --> 00:28:42.710
it changes where we serve or what we do. Maybe that. Maybe not that. Maybe it's just that mentally,

00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:49.029
we're finding it hard to grasp the sense behind the change. Well, we're loyal. We're going to

00:28:49.029 --> 00:28:55.990
cooperate. But our brain keeps saying, why are we going in this direction? It seems to me we

00:28:55.990 --> 00:29:07.509
should be going in that direction instead. Well, if we have been given new direction and mentally

00:29:07.509 --> 00:29:15.269
we're strongly inclined otherwise, then we have a problem. But we also have a solution. And that's

00:29:15.269 --> 00:29:23.460
it. Philippians chapter three. Can we go there? Now, here Paul discusses a problem that existed

00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:28.740
back there in some congregations. Now, was it a big problem in Philippi apparently not?

00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:36.420
But anticipating that it might be a problem for some individuals there, Paul addresses it right here

00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:42.579
in Philippians chapter three, verse 15 and 16. He says, therefore, let those of us who are

00:29:42.579 --> 00:29:50.099
mature be of this mental attitude. And if you are mentally inclined otherwise in any respect,

00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:56.740
God will reveal the above attitude to you. At any rate to the extent with made progress,

00:29:57.539 --> 00:30:07.779
let us go on walking orderly in this same course. What is Paul talking about? A major organizational

00:30:07.779 --> 00:30:17.220
adjustment, the shift from the mosaic law to Christianity. And Paul for one understood it. He

00:30:17.220 --> 00:30:26.579
was not mentally inclined otherwise. He left behind his attachment to the law. Any personal

00:30:26.579 --> 00:30:31.220
advantages that it was bringing him, maybe along the lines of prominence prestige among the Jews,

00:30:31.220 --> 00:30:39.460
left it all behind. That was Paul. But it took some Jewish Christians years to grow to the point

00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:50.019
where they could leave that law behind and fully adopt all aspects of Christianity. Why did it

00:30:50.019 --> 00:30:57.380
take them so long? Now, it's easy for us to say, well, they were stubborn. They had a bad attitude.

00:30:58.180 --> 00:31:05.779
And some of them did. There were some, for example, who wanted to hold on to parts of the law

00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:11.539
just to avoid persecution. So you had things like that going on. But think also of this.

00:31:13.460 --> 00:31:20.420
Prior to Christianity, the mosaic law was Jehovah's arrangement for worship. So there must have been

00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:27.700
some Jewish worshipers who before becoming Christian were very loyal to the mosaic law. And being

00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:35.059
of the loyal sort, what do you think they did? Just obey the law? No, they'd have taken it further.

00:31:35.059 --> 00:31:42.019
They'd have worked hard to cultivate a strong appreciation for the law, a deep love for the way

00:31:42.019 --> 00:31:46.819
different features of the law reflected Jehovah's personality, his ways, his thinking,

00:31:48.019 --> 00:31:53.299
perhaps some invested years bringing their appreciation up to that high level. And now that they had

00:31:54.420 --> 00:32:00.819
the law suddenly goes out of effect, you can appreciate why it might have been hard for some

00:32:00.819 --> 00:32:07.700
loyal ones to process this change mentally. Could something like that happen today? Yes, it could.

00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:15.940
Maybe you're taught years ago. This is how we preach. And this is why. Or this is how the congregation

00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:22.660
handles certain situation. And this is why. Or this is how we view certain branch procedures. And

00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:29.460
this is why it is the very best way. Now being of the loyal sort, what did you do? You made it all your

00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:35.619
own, not just the arrangement itself, but the reasoning behind the arrangement. If somebody came

00:32:35.619 --> 00:32:44.099
along and challenged it, you loyally defended it. And maybe it took you years to bring your appreciation

00:32:44.099 --> 00:32:53.700
up to that high level, but loyally you did. And now that you did, the arrangement changes. And maybe

00:32:53.700 --> 00:33:00.099
even the reasoning behind the arrangement. Well, like some of those early Jewish Christians,

00:33:00.099 --> 00:33:07.700
your very loyalty to a previous theocratic arrangement might make it hard to grasp immediately the

00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:14.660
wisdom behind the new adjustment. Well, like we said, that's the problem. What's the solution? What can we

00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:22.500
actually do about it? Three things. And all three are right there in the verses we just read.

00:33:24.259 --> 00:33:31.220
First, be patient. What do Paul say there in verse 15? Therefore, let those of us who are mature,

00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:37.059
be of this mental attitude. And if you're mentally inclined otherwise, God will reveal the above

00:33:37.059 --> 00:33:43.220
attitude to you. So if you've made an earnest endeavor, a prayerful endeavor to get the sense

00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:51.460
behind a change. And for now, you just can't set it aside, be patient because the day will come.

00:33:52.180 --> 00:34:02.420
Maybe sooner, but maybe later, when the pieces finally fall into place for you and you grasp the

00:34:02.420 --> 00:34:11.619
wisdom behind the adjustment. Now number two, walk orderly. What does that mean? The study note for

00:34:11.619 --> 00:34:18.340
verse 16 explains that walking orderly has to do with moving forward unitedly as Christians. So

00:34:18.420 --> 00:34:24.019
in the context of what we're talking about right now, walking orderly means support the new arrangement

00:34:24.980 --> 00:34:31.059
without resisting, without complaining. Because what does complaining and resisting do? It's

00:34:31.059 --> 00:34:39.059
walking disorderly. It's promoting disunity. So no, we walk orderly. We support the arrangement.

00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:46.980
Now number three, stay busy in your theocratic routine because there in verse 16, Paul encourages

00:34:46.980 --> 00:34:54.659
all of the Philippians to keep making progress. Now the same is true of all of us. Certainly,

00:34:54.659 --> 00:35:00.420
there are many aspects of the truth that we do appreciate. We do understand and we're making

00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:07.380
progress. Good. Put your mind and heart there, right? Rather than continuing to obsess over

00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:15.619
something that you just can't understand for now, stay busy on your assignment and stay absorbed

00:35:15.619 --> 00:35:22.579
in your weekly spiritual routine. It brings immediate contentment. Let's reveal.

00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:31.380
If we ever have a problem, understanding an adjustment to a theocratic arrangement,

00:35:32.019 --> 00:35:42.900
we also have a solution. Philippians 3, 16, be patient, walk orderly, and stay busy in our theocratic

00:35:42.900 --> 00:35:53.300
routine. Now I would like to conclude by illustrating that last point, the value of staying busy

00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:58.900
in our theocratic routine. Because it is the solution, not just what we're talking about right now,

00:35:58.900 --> 00:36:04.500
it is the solution to several situations in life. Now the illustration is one that I heard several

00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:14.099
years ago at a Gillian graduation program. One of your instructors told us about the old steamboats

00:36:14.099 --> 00:36:19.219
that used coal for fuel, right? So upstairs you had the captain in the crew, downstairs you have

00:36:19.219 --> 00:36:26.019
these men busy shoveling coal into the ship's boiler, right? Now imagine one of these workers puts

00:36:26.019 --> 00:36:32.340
his shovel down and he approaches a coworker and says, hey, did I just detect the ship starting

00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:37.539
to make a left turn? That does not seem right to me. It seems that at this point of the trip,

00:36:37.539 --> 00:36:43.380
we should be moving straight forward, not changing direction. I wonder if the captain really knows

00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:47.619
what he's doing. You know what? I'm going to go upstairs and have a word with the captain. Now at

00:36:47.619 --> 00:36:54.579
this point, the speaker stopped describing the scene. He just leaned forward close to the microphone

00:36:55.219 --> 00:37:04.949
and he simply said, shovel the coal. Oh, that's you and me, right? That's you and me. We are

00:37:04.949 --> 00:37:10.789
shoveling the coal. We're busy doing the work. Jehovah assigned us to do. That's what we're

00:37:10.789 --> 00:37:16.550
absorbed in. We let Jehovah take care of Isaiah 60, 17, the copper, the gold, the silver. We take

00:37:16.550 --> 00:37:26.150
care of the coal by staying absorbed and busy in our theocratic routine. And then as Jehovah

00:37:26.150 --> 00:37:33.590
navigates his organization, he'll also navigate us to the right attitude, to contentment,

00:37:34.469 --> 00:37:42.150
and to that most wonderful adjustment of all from this system to life in the new world.

00:37:54.619 --> 00:38:01.739
Well, we thank you very much, Brother Algin, for that three-part solution to a very realistic problem.

00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:08.460
Now, one of your instructors, Brother Richard Shelton, will talk about the subject entitled,

00:38:09.340 --> 00:38:19.099
Have you ever been fooled? Well, this day has finally arrived and you've made it.

00:38:20.860 --> 00:38:27.980
Now for some of you, it is a return trip home. For others, you're off to a new home.

00:38:27.980 --> 00:38:37.579
But no matter where you're going, one thing is for sure. And that is all of you, all of you are

00:38:37.579 --> 00:38:45.659
about to begin a new chapter in your life. Now while that realization can spark feelings of

00:38:45.659 --> 00:38:54.059
excitement, it can also spark a little anxiety as well. Questions may be swirling in your mind.

00:38:54.860 --> 00:39:02.460
Who really am I now? Will I be able to fulfill all that would be expected of me?

00:39:03.579 --> 00:39:11.019
Can I really do this? If you find any of these feelings bubbling up inside of you,

00:39:11.739 --> 00:39:19.500
then remember this. You're not alone. Throughout time, faithful service of God

00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:27.500
have had those same feelings. Let's take a closer look at one of them by turning to the Bible book

00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:38.440
that bears his name, Jeremiah. Jeremiah, chapter 1, notice what he says beginning in verse 4.

00:39:40.519 --> 00:39:48.760
He said, the word of Jehovah came to me saying, before I formed you in the womb, I knew you.

00:39:49.719 --> 00:39:58.119
And before you were born, I sanctified you. I made you a prophet to the nations.

00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:05.320
Now was Jeremiah flattered by the fact that Jehovah saw such potential in him.

00:40:06.599 --> 00:40:13.239
Quite the opposite. Notice his response in verse 6. But I said,

00:40:14.199 --> 00:40:23.800
Alas, O sovereign Lord Jehovah, I do not know how to speak for I am just a boy. In other words,

00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:33.000
I don't think I'm qualified for what you're asking me to do. But notice what Jehovah does, verse 9.

00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:41.639
Then Jehovah stretched out his hand and touched my mouth. And Jehovah said to me,

00:40:41.719 --> 00:40:51.449
I have put my words in your mouth. Jehovah was reassuring, Jeremiah. Don't worry.

00:40:52.889 --> 00:41:01.289
I've got this and you. Well, the nervous prophet accepted his assignment. And admittedly,

00:41:01.289 --> 00:41:09.449
it was not always easy. At times, he met with fierce opposition. He was mobbed, imprisoned,

00:41:10.409 --> 00:41:16.570
left to die in the mud at the bottom of an empty system. Clearly, he went through a lot.

00:41:17.690 --> 00:41:25.460
And at one point, he even thought about quitting. Notice what he says in chapter 20,

00:41:27.139 --> 00:41:37.300
chapter 20, the middle of verse 8. He said, for me, the word of Jehovah has been the cause of

00:41:37.300 --> 00:41:44.099
insults and jeering all day long. So I said, I am not going to make mention of him. And I will

00:41:44.099 --> 00:41:54.579
speak no more in his name. I like Jeremiah. We too may have our moments when we feel like giving up

00:41:54.579 --> 00:42:08.780
is the answer. But let's read on the middle of verse 9. But in my heart, it, the message that he

00:42:08.780 --> 00:42:15.260
had been proclaiming, it became like a burning fire shut up in my bones. And I was tired of holding

00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:26.380
it in. I could no longer endure it. Now what happened here? Despite the hardships, clearly,

00:42:26.380 --> 00:42:35.019
the boy had become the bold prophet of Jehovah. But my question to you is how did that happen?

00:42:35.900 --> 00:42:46.380
Jeremiah himself tells us at verse 11. He says, Jehovah was with me like a fearsome warrior.

00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:55.019
And with the fearsome warrior at his side, Jeremiah went from being unable to speak to being

00:42:55.019 --> 00:43:06.539
unable to hold it in. He experienced a 180 degree change. And he knew exactly who was responsible

00:43:06.539 --> 00:43:13.739
for it. He tells us in our theme scripture text for this talk, same chapter, chapter 20, verse 7.

00:43:14.539 --> 00:43:26.059
He says, you, you have fooled me. Oh, Jehovah. And I, I was fooled. You used your strength against me

00:43:26.059 --> 00:43:36.460
and you prevailed. Jehovah had fooled Jeremiah in a positive way. When Jeremiah reached what he

00:43:36.460 --> 00:43:43.980
thought was his limit, Jehovah proved stronger than Jeremiah's weaknesses and empowered him to

00:43:43.980 --> 00:43:54.489
continue. He was able to make the 180 because he first of all accepted the assignment. Secondly,

00:43:54.489 --> 00:44:01.130
he trusted in Jehovah. And third, he allowed time for God's spirit to work on him.

00:44:01.690 --> 00:44:11.610
And if you think Jeremiah was an isolated case, think again. Moses did the 180. He went from a man

00:44:11.610 --> 00:44:21.769
slow of speech to becoming a mighty leader of an entire nation. Jonah did the 180. He went from

00:44:21.769 --> 00:44:29.130
a man running away from his assignment in the opposite direction to becoming a bold preacher to the

00:44:29.130 --> 00:44:38.650
Ninevites. Peter did the 180. He went from denying the Christ three times to becoming the rock

00:44:38.650 --> 00:44:47.849
that Jesus always knew he could be. So what about you? Have you ever been fooled by Jehovah?

00:44:49.369 --> 00:44:56.409
I'd like to read to you a few words that I recently received from a Gilead graduate. She said this,

00:44:57.369 --> 00:45:04.489
when we heard the news that we were being assigned to a country that had its fair share of poverty,

00:45:04.489 --> 00:45:15.610
instability, and sickness, I felt like saying to Jehovah, are you sure you want to send me there?

00:45:17.130 --> 00:45:25.530
I don't like bugs. And I'm scared of being sick. When the date of our departure came,

00:45:25.530 --> 00:45:30.570
I still remember all the tears I shed when saying goodbye to my home and friends.

00:45:32.250 --> 00:45:39.690
While she accepted their assignment, time went by. Several years later, she and her husband received

00:45:39.690 --> 00:45:44.730
a new assignment to serve in a different country. Notice what she says next.

00:45:46.170 --> 00:45:52.170
If I thought leaving the United States was the hardest thing I would ever do, I was completely

00:45:52.170 --> 00:46:02.809
fooled. Because the sadness I felt when I had to leave those new friends was indescribable.

00:46:04.090 --> 00:46:11.210
I had never cried so much in my life. She goes on to sum up her experience this way. She said,

00:46:11.210 --> 00:46:19.449
Jehovah taught me a lesson in the most loving way. Before Gilead, I was putting myself in a box,

00:46:20.329 --> 00:46:30.090
the what I can do box. But I wasn't thinking that the person who knows best where I fit is Jehovah.

00:46:32.090 --> 00:46:39.289
Is as if he said, you're not only going to adapt to your new assignment, you're going to love it so

00:46:39.289 --> 00:46:46.570
much you will never want to leave. And that's exactly what happened. I came to truly love the people

00:46:46.570 --> 00:46:52.489
in our assignment. And I can honestly say that these past few years have been some of my happiest.

00:46:53.369 --> 00:47:05.210
Now I'm not so afraid of change as before. I just trust in Jehovah, trusting in the process.

00:47:06.329 --> 00:47:16.090
Amazing, isn't it? She too made the 180. She had been fooled by Jehovah just like Jeremiah.

00:47:17.130 --> 00:47:22.969
And she came out stronger and happier as a result. Why did that happen?

00:47:24.170 --> 00:47:31.690
Because when we are fooled by Jehovah, three significant things happen. First, we draw closer to him.

00:47:32.570 --> 00:47:40.570
Secondly, we discover new joys that perhaps we never saw coming. And third, we open the door

00:47:41.130 --> 00:47:49.050
to receiving additional training from Jehovah. In conclusion, just love the people.

00:47:50.650 --> 00:48:01.849
Then they will love you. Then you will love your assignment. Be willing to walk through the doors

00:48:01.849 --> 00:48:11.769
wherever they take you. With the fearsome warrior by your side, you cannot fail. Always welcome

00:48:11.769 --> 00:48:18.170
the chance to be fooled by Jehovah. Because it means that you're about to experience something

00:48:18.170 --> 00:48:23.690
pretty magnificent. And guess what? It has been tailor-made just for you.

00:48:38.329 --> 00:48:45.369
But we thank you, too, Brother Chilton. We really appreciated how you highlighted aspects about

00:48:45.369 --> 00:48:53.130
Jeremiah. A very real and human example for us. And now we have one of your instructors,

00:48:54.570 --> 00:48:59.449
another one, Brother Trent Lippold, who will talk on the interesting subject and titled

00:49:00.170 --> 00:49:13.460
Oil to Machinery. He wrote about one quarter of the Christian Greek scriptures.

00:49:14.420 --> 00:49:19.989
That's almost as much as the Apostle Paul. His name is only mentioned three times.

00:49:20.949 --> 00:49:24.869
And there are scarcely four words that are used to describe him.

00:49:27.019 --> 00:49:32.940
The Physician Luke is one of the most familiar names of whom we know almost nothing about.

00:49:34.539 --> 00:49:41.659
In a world of people trying to look important, Luke shows us what is important.

00:49:42.059 --> 00:49:49.739
Let's see what we can learn from the Physician Luke. The first mention of him, the first description

00:49:49.739 --> 00:49:55.019
of Luke is found in the book of Colossians chapter 3, verse 14. And the Apostle Paul describes

00:49:55.019 --> 00:50:03.260
him there as the beloved Physician. Physician, we focused on that when we considered the gospel of

00:50:03.260 --> 00:50:13.260
Luke, Luke uses medical terms as he writes. But Luke was more than just a physician by occupation.

00:50:13.260 --> 00:50:18.139
Luke was a physician in spirit. He had the heart of a physician, the heart of a healer.

00:50:20.230 --> 00:50:30.739
Let's look at an example. Turn with me please to the book of Luke chapter 4. Luke 4 verses 38 and 39.

00:50:34.500 --> 00:50:39.940
38 says after leaving the synagogue, he, that's Jesus, entered into Simon's home.

00:50:40.739 --> 00:50:46.500
Now Simon's mother-in-law was suffering from a high fever and they asked him to help her.

00:50:47.460 --> 00:50:52.500
So he stood over her and rebuked the fever and it left her, instantly she got up and began

00:50:52.500 --> 00:50:58.900
ministering to them. There we have a mention in verse 38, Luke noted that she had a high fever.

00:50:59.860 --> 00:51:05.940
But look a little closer. What made an impression on Luke? Was it just the high fever?

00:51:06.900 --> 00:51:14.980
The verse says, Simon's mother-in-law was suffering with a high fever. Matthew didn't say that,

00:51:14.980 --> 00:51:29.260
Mark didn't say that. Luke noticed. Look at another example, Luke 22, verse 44, Luke 22, 44. The

00:51:29.260 --> 00:51:35.579
count is in the Garden of Gethsemane and Jesus was there praying. But notice what Luke wrote,

00:51:36.139 --> 00:51:41.260
what caught his attention, verse 44. But he was in such agony that he kept praying more

00:51:41.260 --> 00:51:48.780
earnestly and his sweat became as drops of blood falling to the ground. The physician Luke noticed

00:51:48.780 --> 00:51:58.300
the condition that his sweat became as drops of blood. But look again, it says that he was in such

00:51:58.940 --> 00:52:07.260
agony that his sweat became as drops of blood. Jesus' condition, his agony is what caught Luke's

00:52:07.260 --> 00:52:14.539
attention, not just the physical condition, the medical condition. You see, Luke records Jesus as

00:52:14.539 --> 00:52:22.300
someone who saw men as they were. He saw men without distinction. He saw men and he loved them all.

00:52:23.019 --> 00:52:28.780
Luke shows Jesus as someone whose heart goes out to everyone for whom life is an unequal struggle.

00:52:29.820 --> 00:52:36.860
That made an impression on Luke. Think of Luke's gospel, the things that are uniquely recorded in Luke.

00:52:36.860 --> 00:52:43.019
It's only Luke who tells us about the aged Elizabeth's in Zechariah. Luke tells us about Anna

00:52:43.019 --> 00:52:49.500
in Simeon. Luke tells us about the widow of name. The woman bent over for 18 years. The

00:52:50.460 --> 00:52:56.940
woman who anointed the feet of Jesus with her tears, the Samaritan leper, the rich tax collector's

00:52:56.940 --> 00:53:04.940
achaus, the condemned thief who hung beside Jesus. Those Jesus added to towards these people

00:53:04.940 --> 00:53:14.860
appealed to Luke. And part of me, Luke shared Jesus' view. For Luke too, men of all sorts are in

00:53:15.099 --> 00:53:24.940
the embrace of God's mercy. And this attitude of heart and mind made Luke be loved, the beloved

00:53:24.940 --> 00:53:32.059
physician. And note out that spirit reduced the friction amongst those who were traveling

00:53:32.059 --> 00:53:38.460
with Paul in preaching in the first century. Now, the second description of Luke is found in

00:53:38.539 --> 00:53:45.420
Philemon, verse 24. And there, Luke is described as a fellow worker.

00:53:47.179 --> 00:53:53.579
Open with me the book of Acts, Acts chapter 16. And we'll read beginning in verse 8.

00:53:56.219 --> 00:54:03.500
Acts chapter 16 and verse 8. It says, so they, this is Paul, Timothy, Silas and his

00:54:03.500 --> 00:54:08.940
traveling companions, they passed by Mizia and came down to Troas. And that's where Paul had the

00:54:09.019 --> 00:54:16.059
vision. And he was told to step over into Macedonia. And look at verse 10. As soon as he, that's Paul

00:54:16.059 --> 00:54:24.619
had seen the vision, we tried to go into Macedonia. Verse 11 says, so we put out to see from Troas.

00:54:25.420 --> 00:54:31.340
Here's our introduction to the book of Luke. Luke never praises himself. He never writes about

00:54:31.340 --> 00:54:38.860
himself. We only trace Luke's travels with Paul by the change of a pronoun, from they to we.

00:54:38.940 --> 00:54:46.139
Now, this was in the second missionary tour that Paul, Luke joined, Paul here at Troas and he

00:54:46.139 --> 00:54:52.940
traveled on to Philippi with him. And look at what make Luke a fellow worker. Look at what we

00:54:52.940 --> 00:54:59.579
can learn from him. This is in verse 13. When they arrived in Philippi, verse 13 says, on the Sabbath

00:54:59.579 --> 00:55:06.539
day, we went outside the gate beside a river where we thought there was a place of prayer. And we sat

00:55:06.539 --> 00:55:13.260
down and began speaking to the woman, women who had assembled. And this now is the account of Lydia,

00:55:13.260 --> 00:55:22.300
where Lydia embraces the truth, the kingdom message. But did you notice? It said, we went outside.

00:55:22.300 --> 00:55:28.860
Luke went with them. It said, we thought there was a place of prayer. Luke was involved in the

00:55:28.860 --> 00:55:34.139
thinking process, in the discussion, in the decision about where to go. And Luke was involved in

00:55:34.219 --> 00:55:40.780
speaking to them. Luke was a participant, not simply along for the ride, not a fellow traveler,

00:55:40.780 --> 00:55:48.780
not just a chronicler. Luke was a fellow worker. And there's a beautiful lesson for us and for you.

00:55:50.219 --> 00:55:59.619
Be a participant. Be an example. Get involved in the assignments you are given. Now, it may be that

00:55:59.619 --> 00:56:05.780
Luke stayed in Philippi from 50 to 56. We don't know, but perhaps he did, because he joined Paul,

00:56:06.980 --> 00:56:13.219
again, in 56 CE on the third missionary to a from Philippi. What did he do in Philippi? We don't

00:56:13.219 --> 00:56:20.260
really know. Typically, it's quiet about Luke. But we can assume he must have just been a busy

00:56:20.260 --> 00:56:28.900
fellow worker there in Philippi. No sparks flying, just a busy fellow worker. He joined Paul again

00:56:28.900 --> 00:56:34.500
from 56 from Philippi. He traveled with him to Jerusalem. He was in Jerusalem for the trouble

00:56:34.500 --> 00:56:41.059
in the temple. He traveled with in Cessaria where Paul was a prisoner and continued on with Paul

00:56:41.059 --> 00:56:48.340
to Rome where Paul was a prisoner. Luke, however, was not a prisoner, but he accompanied Paul.

00:56:50.019 --> 00:56:54.340
How comforting that must have been for Paul to have his fellow worker with him.

00:56:54.739 --> 00:57:00.980
When you think about Paul, his countless beatings, the scourging, the stoning, the shipwrecks,

00:57:00.980 --> 00:57:06.420
they must have all taken a toll on him physically, not to mention the thorn and the flesh he had to

00:57:06.420 --> 00:57:11.059
deal with. One of his traveling companions was Timothy with frequent cases of sickness,

00:57:11.059 --> 00:57:20.019
how relieved they must have been to have Luke the physician with them. So Luke is an example of

00:57:20.019 --> 00:57:27.940
long continued devotion to the kingdom work and of unshaken constancy to Paul and his associates.

00:57:29.059 --> 00:57:34.980
And in fact, this warm feeling of a fellow worker, Luke being a fellow worker is perhaps best

00:57:34.980 --> 00:57:42.019
summed up in the final mention of Luke. And that's in 2 Timothy 4 verse 11. Amongst Paul's final

00:57:42.019 --> 00:57:50.820
words, he says, Luke alone is with me. Of all his fellow workers, perhaps there were none

00:57:50.820 --> 00:57:58.500
dearer or few dearer than Luke. You see, Luke's writing contained the least possible mention of

00:57:58.500 --> 00:58:04.980
himself, yet we do not doubt that he was eminently useful to Paul and to all those around him,

00:58:04.980 --> 00:58:09.699
to be sure he enabled Paul to do much more than would have otherwise been possible for him.

00:58:10.659 --> 00:58:18.340
He kept himself out of sight. In his gospel, it is Christ that shines. In the book of Acts,

00:58:18.340 --> 00:58:24.340
it's the kingdom preaching work that shines. And I wonder if the silence in the scriptures

00:58:24.340 --> 00:58:29.860
in direct reference to Luke's intentional. It certainly teaches us something.

00:58:31.059 --> 00:58:38.739
Few other so prominent servants have so little mention and therein lies the lesson from the life

00:58:38.739 --> 00:58:49.300
of Luke. Be an example of a servant who with lowliness of mind finds your service in serving

00:58:49.300 --> 00:58:57.380
others. There was already one Paul. Luke stays in the background. With the spirit of a true servant,

00:58:57.380 --> 00:59:05.619
he did not need the light of publicity to stimulate him. He was not the machine. He was the oil.

00:59:06.260 --> 00:59:15.219
Finally, if the only three words used to describe you are beloved fellow worker,

00:59:16.099 --> 00:59:22.820
your training here at Gilead will have been a success. And you, like Luke, will be oiled to

00:59:22.820 --> 00:59:39.320
machinery. Well, we thank you very, very much for the lip-old. We appreciate it. How you

00:59:39.320 --> 00:59:46.760
highlighted the example of Luke and you applied that interesting theme to his example, oil to machinery.

00:59:47.719 --> 00:59:53.320
Such thought-provoking and encouraging talks. We hope you enjoyed part one.

00:59:53.960 --> 00:59:59.480
Be on the lookout for parts two and three which will be available on jw.org later this month.

01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:06.039
Our program would not be complete without visiting our brothers and sisters in another beautiful

01:00:06.039 --> 01:00:14.440
country. This month, we visit Haiti, which means land of the mountains. Haiti is a tropical

01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:22.360
island located in the Caribbean Sea and has beautiful white sand beaches, rivers, waterfalls,

01:00:22.360 --> 01:00:31.849
and, yes, majestic mountains. Haiti's culture and language are unique in character. Many speak

01:00:31.849 --> 01:00:38.250
French, but the mother tongue of most people is Haitian Creole, an expressive language that combines

01:00:38.250 --> 01:00:45.449
French words with West African grammar. The population reflects a colorful blend of African and

01:00:45.449 --> 01:00:54.170
European traits and cultures. Haitians love to dance, sing, laugh, and, of course, they enjoy

01:00:54.170 --> 01:01:02.570
tasty foods such as TomTom. TomTom is breadfruit, mashed very fine, and often eaten with an

01:01:02.570 --> 01:01:11.369
okra sauce. Haiti has a rich theocratic history. Records don't show exactly when the good news first

01:01:11.369 --> 01:01:18.489
reached Haiti, but as early as February 1887, Zion's watchtower listed Haiti among the places where

01:01:18.489 --> 01:01:24.969
people sent in letters of interest about the good news. The first watchtower missionaries arrived in

01:01:24.969 --> 01:01:32.170
Haiti in 1945. One of them was Roland Frédette, who later became the first branch overseer.

01:01:33.369 --> 01:01:40.250
Hardworking and adventurous missionary sisters such as Gloria Hill, Naomi Adams, Helen Domingo,

01:01:40.250 --> 01:01:45.929
and Francis Bailey made valuable contributions to the preaching activity in the 1950s.

01:01:46.889 --> 01:01:54.650
The Haitian people show a keen interest in the word of God. Today there are over 17,000 active

01:01:54.650 --> 01:02:01.449
publishers. These zealous and happy publishers preach in Haitian Creole, American Sign Language,

01:02:01.449 --> 01:02:07.769
or Spanish. And thanks to the availability of braille publications in Haitian Creole, those who

01:02:07.769 --> 01:02:14.730
are blind are also learning the truth. This mountainous country does not intimidate our loyal

01:02:15.210 --> 01:02:21.050
preachers of the good news. During the summer season, brothers and sisters of all ages head into

01:02:21.050 --> 01:02:28.090
seldom-worked territories. And although Haiti has faced economic challenges and suffered recent

01:02:28.090 --> 01:02:34.570
natural disasters, our brothers and sisters are positive and focus their attention on encouraging

01:02:34.570 --> 01:02:42.090
others to look to the future without fear. The city of Kaupai, Sien is in the northern part of the

01:02:42.090 --> 01:02:48.650
island, and that is where you'll find the 113 publishers of the Morn Rouge congregation.

01:02:49.530 --> 01:02:55.369
They would like to send you their greetings. They want you all to know that they love you very much.

01:02:56.250 --> 01:03:02.889
And we say in Haitian Creole, Nuremangutu, which means we love you too.

01:03:04.170 --> 01:03:09.849
From the world headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses, this is JW Broadcasting.
