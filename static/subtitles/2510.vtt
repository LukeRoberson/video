00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:06.919
So we'll listen together to our first subheading.

00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:09.519
Spiritual Restoration, why it matters.

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:12.759
Let's have the reading of paragraph 9.

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:15.279
Consider that the historical perspective.

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:17.519
Christians back in the first century enjoy

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:19.320
an insured to black people.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.359
Jesus and the apostles foretold that true worship

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:26.000
would be corrupted and lost.

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.689
So kids, what did you learn at meeting tonight?

00:00:34.689 --> 00:00:38.450
No sleeping at the meeting, and no playing at the meeting.

00:00:38.689 --> 00:00:39.689
Good.

00:00:39.689 --> 00:00:42.570
Why should we pay attention at the meetings?

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.689
Imagine if Noah didn't pay attention

00:00:44.689 --> 00:01:06.209
when Jehovah explained how to build the ark.

00:01:06.209 --> 00:01:07.370
You're right.

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:11.409
He paid attention, and it saved his life.

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:15.650
Pay attention at the meetings can help save your life.

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.769
At Genesis 6.22, we read, and Noah

00:01:19.769 --> 00:01:23.370
did according to all that God had commanded him.

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:25.290
He did just so.
