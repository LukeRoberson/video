00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:07.459
At the age of 40, a man of the royal house of Egypt becomes a shepherd.

00:00:07.459 --> 00:00:14.740
40 years later, that shepherd leaves his flock to shepherd people, a nation of slaves

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.780
numbering in the millions.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:20.780
Moses is that 80-year-old shepherd?

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:26.500
He leads the people of Israel out of the hands of their cruel master Egypt, after they have

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.620
resided in that land for more than two centuries.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:37.820
When Moses was 40 years of age, he thought he was qualified to break Egypt's iron grip

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.380
of his people.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.380
How did he show this?

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:52.140
Moses witnessed an incident of terrible injustice, an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his brothers.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:59.229
He was eager to act, so he killed the Egyptian and hid him in the sand.

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:04.790
Summoning on this, the Christian disciple Stephen said, he thought that his brothers would

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:12.150
grasp that God was giving them salvation by his hand, but they did not grasp it.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.510
His own people branded him a killer.

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:23.829
Fearing for his life, Moses fled Egypt and journeyed across the wilderness to Midian.

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:32.950
Even those 40 years, Moses would cultivate patience, meekness, humility, wildness of temper,

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:38.150
self-control, and the ability to wait on Jehovah.

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:43.189
Who of us has not experienced challenges similar to Moses?

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:48.629
Have we had to overcome shyness or stand up to bullying?

00:01:48.629 --> 00:01:55.349
How do we react when faced with injustice or opposition from family or from government?

00:01:55.349 --> 00:02:00.790
Do we tend to get impatient as we wait on Jehovah to make things right?

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:08.270
Or do we put too much confidence in ourselves and too little in Jehovah?

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:14.189
If so, then we can learn a lesson and endurance from the example of Moses.

00:02:14.189 --> 00:02:23.240
Let us start by reading Exodus 3, 1 through 10.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:31.199
Moses became a shepherd of the flock of his father-in-law, Jethro, the priest of Midian.

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:36.199
While he was leading the flock to the west side of the wilderness, he eventually came to

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:40.719
the mountain of the true God to Horel.

00:02:40.719 --> 00:02:47.240
Then Jehovah's angel appeared to him in a flame of fire in the midst of a thorn bush.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:53.159
As he kept looking, he saw that the thorn bush was on fire and yet the thorn bush was

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:54.919
not consumed.

00:02:54.919 --> 00:02:57.520
So Moses said,

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:04.520
I will go over to inspect this unusual site to see why the thorn bush does not burn up.

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:10.039
When Jehovah saw that he went over to look, God called to him out of the thorn bush and

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:11.680
said,

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:13.840
Moses,

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.919
Moses,

00:03:15.919 --> 00:03:18.520
to which he said,

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.360
here I am,

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.280
then he said,

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:29.280
do not come any nearer. Remove your sandals from your feet

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.759
because the place where you are standing is holy ground.

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:37.879
He went on to say,

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:47.080
I am the God of your Father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:52.520
Then Moses hid his face because he was afraid to look at the true God.

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.199
Jehovah added,

00:03:55.199 --> 00:04:00.840
I have certainly seen the affliction of my people who are an Egypt

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:06.719
and I have heard their outcry because of those who forced them to work.

00:04:06.719 --> 00:04:10.879
I well know the pains they suffer.

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:15.120
I will go down to rescue them out of the hand of the Egyptians

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.839
and to bring them up out of that land to a land good and spacious,

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:22.959
a land flowing with milk and honey,

00:04:22.959 --> 00:04:29.360
the territory of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Parasites,

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.040
the Highvites, and the Jebiusites.

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:38.560
Now look, the outcry of the people of Israel has reached me

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:44.240
and I have seen also the harsh way that the Egyptians are pressing them.

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.399
Now come, I will send you to Pharaoh

00:04:48.399 --> 00:04:53.680
and you will bring my people the Israelites out of Egypt.

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.639
Moses now had a divine commission.

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:00.240
The time had come for Jehovah to free his people.

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:06.240
The time had come for Moses to be a faithful leader who does not give up.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.800
Would he accept this assignment?

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:14.319
One that he'd been only too eager to take up 40 years earlier in Egypt?

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:22.300
Let's pick up the Bible account at Exodus 3 11 through 22.

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:26.060
However, Moses said to the true God,

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:32.060
Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the Israelites out of Egypt?

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:33.899
To this he said,

00:05:33.899 --> 00:05:41.019
I will prove to be with you and this is the sign for you that it was I who sent you.

00:05:41.019 --> 00:05:44.139
After you have brought the people out of Egypt,

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:48.939
you people will serve the true God on this mountain.

00:05:48.939 --> 00:05:52.060
But Moses said to the true God,

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:55.819
Suppose I go to the Israelites and say to them,

00:05:55.819 --> 00:06:01.019
the God of your forefathers has sent me to you and they say to me,

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:04.379
What is his name? What should I say to them?

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:07.740
So God said to Moses,

00:06:09.019 --> 00:06:14.459
I will become what I choose to become and he added,

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.060
This is what you are to say to the Israelites.

00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:22.139
I will become has sent me to you.

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:25.819
Then God said once more to Moses,

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:29.899
This is what you are to say to the Israelites.

00:06:31.019 --> 00:06:35.740
Jehovah, the God of your forefathers, the God of Abraham,

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:39.740
the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob has sent me to you.

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:47.980
This is my name forever and this is how I am to be remembered from generation to generation.

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:53.980
Now go and gather the elders of Israel and say to them,

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:57.740
Jehovah, the God of your forefathers has appeared to me,

00:06:58.379 --> 00:07:02.620
the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and he said,

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:08.779
I have certainly taken notice of you and of what is being done to you in Egypt.

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:15.660
So I say I will take you away from affliction at the hands of the Egyptians

00:07:16.379 --> 00:07:23.740
to the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Parasites, the Highvites and the

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:28.060
Jebiusites to a land flowing with milk and honey.

00:07:29.579 --> 00:07:36.300
They will certainly listen to your voice and you will go you and the elders of Israel

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:39.660
to the king of Egypt and you men should say to him,

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:44.379
Jehovah, the God of the Hebrews has communicated with us.

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:52.540
So please let us make a three-day journey into the wilderness so that we may sacrifice to Jehovah our

00:07:52.540 --> 00:08:00.779
God that I myself well know that the king of Egypt will not give you permission to go unless a mighty

00:08:00.779 --> 00:08:08.779
hand compels him. So I will have to stretch out my hand and strike Egypt with all my extraordinary

00:08:08.779 --> 00:08:16.620
acts that I will do in it and after that he will send you out and I will give this people favor

00:08:16.699 --> 00:08:22.779
in the eyes of the Egyptians and when you go you will by no means go empty handed.

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:29.579
Each woman must ask her neighbor and the woman lodging in her house for articles of silver and

00:08:29.579 --> 00:08:37.259
of gold as well as clothing and you will put them on your sons and your daughters and you will plunder

00:08:37.259 --> 00:08:45.980
the Egyptians. What a dramatic change 40 years has brought to Moses. Here is a different Moses

00:08:46.539 --> 00:08:52.779
one who is uncertain shy. Moses has serious doubts about his own qualifications.

00:08:53.980 --> 00:09:01.820
He believes that his commission is too much for him. In effect he says, oh no, please don't ask

00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:09.980
me to do this. Can you put yourself in Moses' sandals? Have you ever been given an assignment

00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:17.100
that you feel is beyond your ability? Yet you don't give up. Ernest Prayer helps restore your

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:27.100
confidence. You obey. What about Moses? Jehovah reassures him by saying, I will prove to be with you.

00:09:28.539 --> 00:09:34.700
Yet Moses is still hesitant. Will he give up and ask Jehovah to find someone else?

00:09:35.179 --> 00:09:48.139
Not what Exodus 4 1 through 9 says. However, Moses answered. But suppose they do not believe me and

00:09:48.139 --> 00:09:56.620
do not listen to my voice for they will say, Jehovah did not appear to you? Then Jehovah said to him,

00:09:57.259 --> 00:10:05.740
what is that in your hand? He answered, a rod. He said, throw it on the ground.

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:13.659
So he threw it on the ground and it became a serpent. Moses fled from it.

00:10:14.539 --> 00:10:19.980
Jehovah now said to Moses, reach out your hand and seize it by the tail.

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:27.500
So he reached out and seized it and it became a rod in his hand. God then said,

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:34.779
this is so that they may believe that Jehovah, the God of their forefathers, the God of Abraham,

00:10:34.779 --> 00:10:42.940
the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob has appeared to you. Jehovah said to him once more,

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:47.740
put your hand, please, into the upper fold of your garment.

00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:56.379
So he put his hand into the fold of his garment. When he drew it out, why his hand was stricken with

00:10:56.379 --> 00:11:04.139
leprosy like snow? Then he said, return your hand into the upper fold of your garment.

00:11:05.419 --> 00:11:10.860
So he returned his hand into his garment. When he drew it out of the garment,

00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:15.259
it was restored like the rest of his flesh. He said,

00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:20.460
if they will not believe you or pay attention to the first sign,

00:11:21.179 --> 00:11:28.220
then they will certainly heed the next sign. Still, even if they will not believe these two signs

00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:34.620
and refuse to listen to your voice, you will take some water from the Nile River and pour it out

00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:40.620
on the dry land. And the water that you take from the Nile will become blood on the dry land.

00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:50.620
Moses needs reassurance, so Jehovah gives Moses not just one, but three signs to show the

00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:55.980
older men proof of divine backing. And what powerful credentials these are.

00:11:56.940 --> 00:12:04.059
For the first time, a human is empowered to perform miracles, as the rest of Exodus chapter 4 shows.

00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:11.019
Moses feels inadequate to speak to Pharaoh. He pleads that he is slow of tongue,

00:12:11.899 --> 00:12:17.580
even asking Jehovah to excuse him from the task. Jehovah gives him help.

00:12:18.539 --> 00:12:24.539
Jehovah assigns Aaron as Moses' mouthpiece. Both men proceed to meet Pharaoh.

00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:31.100
Listen to what is said to Pharaoh as found at Exodus 5, 1-9.

00:12:35.519 --> 00:12:39.679
Afterward, Moses and Aaron win in and said to Pharaoh,

00:12:40.799 --> 00:12:43.919
this is what Jehovah, the God of Israel, says.

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:50.159
Send my people away so that they may celebrate a festival to me in the wilderness.

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:52.559
But Pharaoh said,

00:12:53.759 --> 00:13:02.720
Who is Jehovah that I should obey his voice to send Israel away? I do not know Jehovah at all.

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:11.120
And what is more, I will not send Israel away. But they said, the God of the Hebrews has

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:19.200
communicated with us. Please, we want to make a three-day journey into the wilderness and sacrifice

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:25.360
to Jehovah our God. Otherwise, he will strike us with disease or with the sword.

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:28.879
The King of Egypt replied to them,

00:13:28.879 --> 00:13:35.600
Why is it Moses and Aaron that you are taking the people away from their work,

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:40.960
return to your labor? And Pharaoh continued,

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:48.080
Look at how many people of the land there are and you would have them rest from their labor.

00:13:48.559 --> 00:13:54.559
That same day, Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters and their foreman.

00:13:55.759 --> 00:14:02.799
You must no longer give straw to the people to make bricks. Let them go and gather straw for

00:14:02.799 --> 00:14:10.240
themselves. But you must still impose on them the same quota of bricks as they made in the past.

00:14:10.879 --> 00:14:17.200
Do not reduce it for them, for they are relaxing. That is why they are crying out.

00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:25.919
We want to go. We want to sacrifice to our God. Make them work harder and keep them busy

00:14:25.919 --> 00:14:29.039
so that they will not pay attention to lies.

00:14:31.889 --> 00:14:39.730
Pharaoh defiantly says no to Jehovah. He is angry at the Hebrews. In turn, the people are

00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:46.929
angry at Moses. They blame him for their hardship. Moses feels sorry for the people and asked

00:14:46.929 --> 00:14:55.009
Jehovah, Why have you sent me? Jehovah patiently gives Moses a reassuring message beginning at

00:14:55.009 --> 00:15:06.559
Exodus 6 verse 1. So Jehovah said to Moses, Now you will see what I will do to Pharaoh.

00:15:07.759 --> 00:15:14.159
A mighty hand will force him to send them away and a mighty hand will force him to drive them out

00:15:14.159 --> 00:15:25.039
of his land. Then God said to Moses, I am Jehovah and I used to appear to Abraham, Isaac,

00:15:25.039 --> 00:15:33.039
and Jacob as God Almighty. But with regard to my name Jehovah, I did not make myself known to them.

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:40.480
I also established my covenant with them to give them the land of Canaan, the land in which they

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:47.600
lived as foreigners. Now I myself have heard the groaning of the people of Israel whom the

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:59.519
Egyptians are enslaving and I remember my covenant. Therefore, say to the Israelites, I am Jehovah

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:05.679
and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians and rescue you from their slavery.

00:16:06.559 --> 00:16:13.519
And I will reclaim you with an outstretched arm and with great judgments and I will take you in as

00:16:13.519 --> 00:16:21.600
my people and I will be your God and you will certainly know that I am Jehovah your God who is

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:28.159
bringing you out from under the burdens of Egypt. And I will bring you into the land that I swore

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:36.080
with an oath to give to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. And I will give it to you as something to possess.

00:16:37.279 --> 00:16:45.759
I am Jehovah. Jehovah backs up his promise of deliverance by means of his unique name.

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:55.120
Moses therefore does not give up. He obeys Jehovah and he and Aaron prepare to meet Pharaoh again.

00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:59.120
Let's read Exodus 7, 1 through 7.

00:17:06.589 --> 00:17:14.349
See, I have made you like God to Pharaoh and Aaron your own brother will become your prophet.

00:17:15.549 --> 00:17:21.390
You are to repeat everything that I will command you and Aaron your brother will speak to Pharaoh

00:17:22.109 --> 00:17:25.390
and he will send the Israelites away from his land.

00:17:26.349 --> 00:17:34.910
As for me, I will allow Pharaoh's heart to become obstinate and I will multiply my signs and my

00:17:34.910 --> 00:17:43.630
miracles in the land of Egypt. But Pharaoh will not listen to you and I will lay my hand upon Egypt

00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:50.349
and bring my multitudes, my people, the Israelites out of the land of Egypt with great judgments

00:17:51.069 --> 00:17:58.589
and the Egyptians will certainly know that I am Jehovah when I stretch out my hand against Egypt

00:17:58.589 --> 00:18:01.390
and bring the Israelites out from among them.

00:18:03.390 --> 00:18:09.230
Moses and Aaron did what Jehovah had commanded them. They did just so.

00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:15.390
Moses was 80 years old and Aaron was 83 years old when they spoke to Pharaoh.

00:18:17.950 --> 00:18:24.750
Moses now can be confident of Jehovah's backing because Moses is doing things Jehovah's way

00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:28.029
and at a time that fits Jehovah's prophetic timetable.

00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:33.390
Jehovah is about to use 10 plagues to bring Pharaoh to his knees.

00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:41.230
These disasters will show that Jehovah's sovereignty is real and that he is worthy of worship.

00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:49.869
The 10 plagues will also expose the Egyptian gods as nothing, as mere unreality.

00:18:49.869 --> 00:18:55.710
The first three plagues strike both the Egyptians and the Hebrews.

00:18:55.710 --> 00:19:00.670
However, the next seven plagues do not touch the Hebrews.

00:19:00.670 --> 00:19:07.869
Proof that Jehovah can set apart and protect his worshipers if they do not give up their trust in him.

00:19:08.670 --> 00:19:15.150
Now let's summarize the 10 plagues listed at Exodus 7-14 to 11-10.

00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:17.950
Plague 1

00:19:19.309 --> 00:19:23.150
Water is turned into blood. Plague 2

00:19:24.190 --> 00:19:28.910
frogs invade the land and houses. Plague 3

00:19:29.869 --> 00:19:34.269
Nats pester man and beast. Plague 4

00:19:34.990 --> 00:19:40.670
Godflies swarm and bite only the Egyptians. Plague 5

00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:44.670
livestock die. Plague 6

00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:50.269
boils fester on man and beast. Plague 7

00:19:51.069 --> 00:19:56.269
Hell strikes man, beast and vegetation. Plague 8

00:19:56.910 --> 00:20:03.950
locust swarm and eat all vegetation left after the Hellstorm. Plague 9

00:20:04.829 --> 00:20:10.750
thick darkness blankets Egypt for three days. Plague 10

00:20:11.549 --> 00:20:18.029
the firstborn of man and livestock is killed. Pharaoh sees his firstborn dead.

00:20:19.390 --> 00:20:25.390
He hears great outcries of bitter grief rise from the houses of all the Egyptians

00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:32.509
because they too see their firstborn dead. Pharaoh quickly summons Moses and Aaron

00:20:32.509 --> 00:20:41.390
and tells them to go to hurry away. Will Pharaoh's heart soften? Let's have Exodus 14

00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:52.130
5-10 answer. Later it was reported to the king of Egypt that the people had run away.

00:20:53.009 --> 00:20:58.369
Immediately Pharaoh and his servants had a change of heart regarding the people and they said

00:21:00.049 --> 00:21:05.569
why did we do this and release Israel from serving a slave for us?

00:21:06.849 --> 00:21:16.289
So he made his war chariots ready and he took his people with him. He took 600 chosen chariots

00:21:16.289 --> 00:21:23.170
and all the other chariots of Egypt with warriors on every one of them. Thus Jehovah allowed

00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:29.650
the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt to become obstinate and he chased after the Israelites

00:21:29.650 --> 00:21:35.569
while the Israelites were going out with confidence. The Egyptians chased after them

00:21:35.569 --> 00:21:41.410
and all the chariots horses of Pharaoh and his cavalrymen and his army were catching up with them

00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:50.130
while they were camping by the sea by Pyahaira facing Bale Zifang. When Pharaoh got closer

00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:57.730
the Israelites raised their eyes and saw the Egyptians pursuing them. The Israelites became

00:21:57.730 --> 00:22:06.930
terrified and began to cry out to Jehovah. Will Jehovah hear their cry for help?

00:22:07.410 --> 00:22:16.559
Let's read Exodus 14 13 through 31. Then Moses said to the people,

00:22:17.359 --> 00:22:26.559
do not be afraid. Stand firm and see the salvation of Jehovah that he will perform for you today.

00:22:26.559 --> 00:22:36.400
For the Egyptians whom you see today you will never ever see again. Jehovah himself will fight for

00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:46.400
you and you will keep silent. Jehovah now said to Moses, why do you keep crying out to me?

00:22:47.039 --> 00:22:55.519
Tell the Israelites that they should break camp. As for you, lift up your rod and stretch out

00:22:55.519 --> 00:23:02.480
your hand over the sea and divide it so that the Israelites may go through the midst of the sea on

00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:11.119
dry ground. As for me, I am allowing the hearts of the Egyptians to become obstinate so that they

00:23:11.119 --> 00:23:18.880
will go in after them. Thus I will glorify myself by means of Pharaoh and all his army,

00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:27.039
his war chariots and his cavalrymen, and the Egyptians will certainly know that I am Jehovah.

00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:33.680
When I glorify myself by means of Pharaoh, his war chariots and his cavalrymen.

00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:43.619
Then the angel of the true God who was going ahead of the camp of Israel departed and went to their

00:23:43.619 --> 00:23:49.619
rear and the pillar of cloud that was in front of them moved to the rear and stood behind them.

00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:55.700
So it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel.

00:23:56.500 --> 00:24:02.579
On the one side it was a dark cloud. On the other side it was lighting up the night.

00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:12.690
So the one camp did not come near the other camp all night long. Moses now stretched out his hand

00:24:12.690 --> 00:24:19.809
over the sea and Jehovah drove the sea back with a strong east wind all night long,

00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:25.809
turning the sea basin into dry ground and the waters divided.

00:24:27.250 --> 00:24:33.490
So the Israelites went through the midst of the sea on dry ground while the waters formed a

00:24:33.490 --> 00:24:40.289
wall on their right hand and on their left. The Egyptians pursued them and all Pharaoh's

00:24:40.289 --> 00:24:46.369
horses, his war chariots and his cavalrymen began going after them into the midst of the sea.

00:24:47.650 --> 00:24:53.970
During the morning watch, Jehovah looked at the camp of the Egyptians from within the pillar of

00:24:53.970 --> 00:25:01.329
fire and cloud and he threw the camp of the Egyptians into confusion. He kept taking wheels off

00:25:01.329 --> 00:25:07.490
their chariots so that they were driving them with difficulty and the Egyptians were saying,

00:25:08.769 --> 00:25:15.970
let us flee from any contact with Israel because Jehovah is fighting for them against the Egyptians.

00:25:17.089 --> 00:25:19.569
Then Jehovah said to Moses,

00:25:20.450 --> 00:25:26.769
stretch out your hand over the sea so that the waters may come back over the Egyptians,

00:25:26.769 --> 00:25:29.650
their war chariots and their cavalrymen.

00:25:31.490 --> 00:25:37.809
Moses at once stretched out his hand over the sea and as morning approached,

00:25:37.809 --> 00:25:40.930
the sea returned to its normal condition.

00:25:41.970 --> 00:25:48.210
As the Egyptians fled from it, Jehovah shook the Egyptians off into the midst of the sea.

00:25:49.250 --> 00:25:55.089
The returning waters covered the war chariots and the cavalrymen and all of Pharaoh's army

00:25:55.170 --> 00:26:02.289
who had gone into the sea after them. Not so much as one among them was allowed to survive.

00:26:04.049 --> 00:26:12.049
But the Israelites walked on dry ground in the midst of the sea bin and the waters formed a wall

00:26:12.049 --> 00:26:19.890
on their right hand and on their left. Thus Jehovah saved Israel on that day from the hand

00:26:20.049 --> 00:26:25.970
of the Egyptians and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore.

00:26:27.250 --> 00:26:33.730
Israel also saw the great power that Jehovah wielded against the Egyptians

00:26:34.369 --> 00:26:40.930
and the people began to fear Jehovah and to put faith in Jehovah and in his servant Moses.

00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:48.140
Are the Hebrews happy that they enjoyed to see the salvation of Jehovah?

00:26:49.019 --> 00:26:53.099
Yes. They break out in a joyful victory song.

00:26:53.980 --> 00:26:58.140
Listen to them sing. You too can stand and sing along.

00:26:59.019 --> 00:27:05.819
Song number 149 represents what is found at Exodus 15, 1-21.

00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:12.779
If you can, let us all stand and sing song 149.

00:29:35.009 --> 00:29:43.200
Please be seated. The account we just read vividly illustrates Jehovah's use of power

00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:50.240
in a way that serves notice on all who defy him. Thus what can we take away from our Bible reading?

00:29:51.519 --> 00:29:57.759
The fact that the Hebrews suffered in Egypt and Jehovah delivered them is concrete proof

00:29:58.319 --> 00:30:02.960
that our hope for deliverance from Satan's world is not an empty one.

00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:09.200
When you seem trapped in a corner by life's problems, do not give up.

00:30:10.559 --> 00:30:14.400
The God who parted the Red Sea can provide escape for you too.

00:30:16.079 --> 00:30:22.319
If during the coming Great Tribulation you feel trapped by Satan's hordes, remember,

00:30:22.319 --> 00:30:31.039
endure to the end. Jehovah will provide escape for you and for all his worshipers who don't give up.
