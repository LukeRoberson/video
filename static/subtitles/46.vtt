WEBVTT

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.929
Hello, and welcome to this month's broadcast.

00:00:05.929 --> 00:00:10.330
With me, I have a good friend as my co-host, Leon Viva.

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:13.330
Leon, what do we have to look forward to this time?

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:14.929
Thanks, Brother Lush.

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:19.730
We'll see a young brother who must choose between his loyalty to Jehovah

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:21.730
or to a close friend.

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.530
Which will he choose?

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:29.129
Then, we'll hear the story of Rafika Mars, a young woman

00:00:29.129 --> 00:00:32.530
who desperately fought for racial equality

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:37.530
but eventually discovers the real path to peace.

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.729
And we'll also enjoy a new music video

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:47.729
that beautifully highlights the importance of putting our confidence in Jehovah.

00:00:47.729 --> 00:01:13.909
We have much to look forward to on this March 2018 edition of JW Broadcasting.

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:18.709
The theme for this month is, in whom do you trust?

00:01:18.709 --> 00:01:20.109
Do you trust me?

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:21.510
I hope so.

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.510
All of us want to be trusted.

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.909
A trust is a basic element of everyday life.

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:30.909
To trust others is a normal reaction.

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:34.510
Many of us have traveled on the train or bus.

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:39.909
Did we worry whether the conductor or driver would bring a safely to our destination?

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:42.109
Normally, we do not worry.

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:47.310
We trust an airplane captain to take us safely to our destination.

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.709
We trust that when we enter an elevator

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:52.510
that it will not crash at the bottom of the shaft

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:56.510
but safely take us to the desired floor.

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:01.109
When we marry, we trust that our partner will remain faithful.

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:04.909
In many situations in life, we need trust.

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:06.709
What is trust?

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:15.110
Trust is the firm belief in the reliability, truth or ability of someone or something.

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:21.110
Webster's dictionary says that it is confidence, a reliance or a resting of the mind

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:29.909
on the integrity, veracity, justice, friendship, or other sound principle of another person.

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:37.110
Trust is related to confidence, belief, faith and assurance.

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:45.310
Experiments conducted by Professor Dr. Mikhail Kosfeld, a professor at a university in Frankfurt, Germany,

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:53.310
led him to the conclusion that trust is a biologically-based part of human nature.

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:58.310
Kosfeld discovered that when there's interaction between two people,

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:03.710
the human brain releases a hormone that stimulates trust.

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:11.310
It is, in fact, one of the distinguishing features of the human species, Kosfeld states.

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.110
In everyday life, how discouraged some are if they are not trusted.

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.909
The phrase, don't you trust me?

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:24.710
Is frequently heard with an undertone of sadness or complaint?

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:29.509
Sometimes children or teenagers ask their parents, don't you trust me?

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:35.909
When the parents place some restrictions on them, perhaps in connection with leisure time activities?

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:44.310
Parents do that because they love you young ones and want to prevent any spiritual or physical harm before you.

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:53.909
If you cooperate, you will see that parents will gradually trust you ever more and grant you more liberty to you.

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:58.110
You can prove to them that you are trustworthy.

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:01.110
In the world, many people are not trustworthy.

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:08.110
Since we are living in the time of the end and the demons are desperate and have influenced many people,

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:13.909
we have to admit that trusting in everybody is not wise.

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:17.310
Many trusted in religion and were disappointed.

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:22.910
Others trusted in governments or the United Nations, but they were disappointed.

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:28.910
They trusted political leaders that made all kinds of promises, but did not keep all of them.

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:33.709
Some politicians even were exposed as being liars.

00:04:33.709 --> 00:04:36.509
Proverbs 14, 15 says,

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:43.709
The naive person believes every word, but the shrewd one ponders each step.

00:04:43.709 --> 00:04:51.310
If somebody, even in the truth, promises as big monetary returns if we give him money for his plant investment,

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:55.709
we need to be careful and not believe every word.

00:04:55.709 --> 00:05:03.509
Some that spent their money were in for a disappointment when they learned that everything was lost.

00:05:03.509 --> 00:05:10.509
We also should not trust everything we read in newspapers or see on television.

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:13.310
There's another thing we should not trust in.

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:23.509
Riches. Some 49, 6 speaks about those who are trusting in their wealth and who boast about their great riches.

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:27.509
Trusting in riches often leads to disappointment.

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:34.310
The one trusting in his riches will fall, says Proverbs 11, 28.

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:39.709
It is not wrong to be rich, just do not trust in riches.

00:05:39.709 --> 00:05:43.110
Riches are a risk factor.

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:46.310
Many people today are dishonest and cheat.

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:55.509
Some business owners have installed cameras at the workplace since they do not trust their employees to put in a full day of work.

00:05:55.509 --> 00:06:00.310
They know that some would play video games during work hours.

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:05.310
But Jehovah created us with the inclination to trust.

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:08.910
We can especially trust our spiritual brothers.

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:12.709
True, once in a while such trust is misplaced.

00:06:12.709 --> 00:06:19.910
A few commit serious sins and have to be disfellowshed, but that is rare.

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:24.709
Jehovah himself is the best example of trusting in others.

00:06:24.709 --> 00:06:32.709
He trusted the logos to faithfully cooperate with him as the master worker in creating the universe, the earth,

00:06:32.709 --> 00:06:37.310
and all the living things on earth, including mankind.

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:43.310
What tremendous trust Jehovah showed in Jesus when he sent him to the earth.

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:54.110
Jehovah trusted that Jesus would remain faithful and redeem mankind so that his will and purpose with mankind and the earth could be accomplished.

00:06:54.110 --> 00:07:02.709
Jehovah trusted him so much that he arranged for prophecies to be written that foretold that he would die faithfully.

00:07:02.709 --> 00:07:06.709
This trust on the part of Jehovah was not a risk.

00:07:06.709 --> 00:07:13.310
It was based on the collaboration between the two for eons of time.

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:16.910
Think of the prophecy in Psalm 1610,

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:21.509
for you will not leave me in the grave.

00:07:21.509 --> 00:07:23.310
Jesus had free will.

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:27.310
This means that theoretically he could have sinned.

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:35.310
If he could not have sinned, Satan would probably not have tried three times to tempt Jesus to sin.

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:43.709
If Jesus could not have sinned, why would he be so heavily distressed in the Garden of Gethsemane that he was sweating blood?

00:07:43.709 --> 00:07:51.310
Why send an angel to comfort and strengthen him if he could not sin or fail anyway?

00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:52.509
No question.

00:07:52.509 --> 00:07:59.310
Jesus felt the unfathomable load on his shoulders to remain faithful,

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:07.310
since not only the salvation of mankind depended on him, but also the vindication of Jehovah's sovereignty.

00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:10.709
He did not want to disappoint Jehovah.

00:08:10.709 --> 00:08:16.910
Jesus used his own free will and was determined to stay loyal.

00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:21.110
How glad we are that he did.

00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:25.509
On the other hand, Jesus also trusted Jehovah completely.

00:08:25.509 --> 00:08:31.310
He trusted Jehovah that he would resurrect him if he would die faithfully.

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:35.710
Actually, Jesus was publicly known to trust in Jehovah.

00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:40.509
People that passed by when he was on the torture stake were saying,

00:08:40.509 --> 00:08:46.710
he has put his trust in God, let him now rescue him if he wants him.

00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:49.710
For he said, I am God's son.

00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:52.710
Another example of trust was Abraham.

00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:58.509
When God told him to kill his beloved son Isaac, Abraham was willing to do so.

00:08:58.509 --> 00:09:03.110
He trusted that Jehovah could resurrect him.

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:10.309
Hebrews 11.19 says, he reasoned that God was able to raise him up even from the dead

00:09:10.309 --> 00:09:14.710
and he did receive him from there in an illustrative way.

00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:21.710
1 Corinthians 137 says, that love believes all things.

00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:25.110
Love trusts that prophecies will come true.

00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:28.909
It also believes what our brothers tell us.

00:09:28.909 --> 00:09:36.110
It also helps to grant others the benefit of the doubt if a matter could be interpreted in different ways.

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:40.409
Yes, trusting others is an expression of love.

00:09:40.409 --> 00:09:46.659
If you love somebody, you only assume and think the best of him.

00:09:46.659 --> 00:09:50.860
Another example of trust in Jehovah was Moses.

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:55.259
He led the nation of Israel out of Egypt into the desert.

00:09:55.259 --> 00:09:58.860
A nation of upwards of three million people

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:03.059
and they had flocks of cattle and sheep with them.

00:10:03.059 --> 00:10:09.460
When he left Egypt, did he know how to provide these great crowds with water in the desert?

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:16.460
Did he know what they would be eating after the initial foodstuffs that they took out of Egypt would run out?

00:10:16.559 --> 00:10:22.059
Did he know in advance that Jehovah would miraculously provide the manner?

00:10:22.059 --> 00:10:24.059
It doesn't seem so.

00:10:24.059 --> 00:10:30.059
But he trusted that Jehovah would take care of the people.

00:10:30.059 --> 00:10:34.460
The three friends of Daniel were another fine example of trust.

00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:41.159
They did not bow and worship in front of an idol that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up.

00:10:41.159 --> 00:10:47.259
They were told they would be thrown into a fiery furnace if they disobeyed.

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:51.659
They remained firm and were protected by an angel,

00:10:51.659 --> 00:10:55.159
so the fire did not do any harm to them.

00:10:55.159 --> 00:10:59.360
After that, Nebuchadnezzar then declared,

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:03.559
praised be the God of Shadrach, Mishak and Abednego,

00:11:03.559 --> 00:11:07.360
who sent his angel and rescued his servants.

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:11.059
They trusted in him and went against the command of the King

00:11:11.059 --> 00:11:17.159
and were willing to die rather than serve or worship any God except their own God.

00:11:17.559 --> 00:11:21.159
As we are getting ever closer to the great tribulation,

00:11:21.159 --> 00:11:28.059
we might be confronted with scary challenges and tests related to nationalism.

00:11:28.059 --> 00:11:30.860
Will we keep trusting Jehovah?

00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:32.659
We trust we will.

00:11:32.659 --> 00:11:37.259
Jehovah will miraculously save his people throughout the great tribulation

00:11:37.259 --> 00:11:40.860
and arrange for their survival.

00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:46.159
Today, the faithful slave was put in charge of providing spiritual food for God's people

00:11:46.159 --> 00:11:49.059
who number into the millions.

00:11:49.059 --> 00:11:52.559
The slave also shows complete trust in Jehovah

00:11:52.559 --> 00:11:56.559
that he will guide them with his Holy Spirit.

00:11:56.559 --> 00:11:59.759
What makes it possible for the faithful and discreet slave

00:11:59.759 --> 00:12:03.759
to provide precious spiritual food?

00:12:03.759 --> 00:12:08.659
I will give you insight and structure in the way you should go,

00:12:08.659 --> 00:12:13.559
says Jehovah, Psalm 32 verse 8.

00:12:13.559 --> 00:12:17.960
Today, Jehovah provides direction to the slave through Jesus.

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:24.659
Jesus, in turn, provides direction for his people through the faithful and discreet slave.

00:12:24.659 --> 00:12:34.009
We can have, therefore, full confidence in the scriptural insight, understanding and guidance.

00:12:34.009 --> 00:12:36.710
Satan tries to sow mistrust.

00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:39.309
Under Communist dictatorship in Romania,

00:12:39.309 --> 00:12:43.710
the secret police officers forced a responsible brother to walk with them

00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:45.710
on a heavily frequented street,

00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:48.409
hoping that other brothers would see this

00:12:48.409 --> 00:12:53.409
and wrongly conclude that this brother works with the secret police.

00:12:53.409 --> 00:12:55.409
Did the scheme work out?

00:12:55.409 --> 00:12:57.909
No, it failed.

00:12:57.909 --> 00:13:02.210
Brothers did see him but kept trusting him.

00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:08.320
We learn that we should not quickly lose trust in our brothers.

00:13:08.419 --> 00:13:13.220
Satan also has the scheme to spread rumors about faithful brothers,

00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:16.419
including the faithful slave.

00:13:16.419 --> 00:13:19.820
The method of spreading rumors is not new.

00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:22.919
When Jesus was resurrected and the tomb was empty,

00:13:22.919 --> 00:13:27.919
the soldiers that reported it were told to spread the rumor that the disciples came

00:13:27.919 --> 00:13:31.019
and stole the body at night.

00:13:31.019 --> 00:13:35.620
March 28, 15, relates.

00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:39.919
So they took the silver pieces and did as they were instructed.

00:13:39.919 --> 00:13:45.919
And this story has been spread abroad among the Jews up to this very day.

00:13:45.919 --> 00:13:52.519
Another rumor in the first century was that Christians were responsible for the great fire of Rome.

00:13:52.519 --> 00:13:56.019
Could such accusation be true?

00:13:56.019 --> 00:13:58.820
Historians say that it was narrow,

00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:03.320
the emperor who set fire to the city.

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:09.120
Today rumors are occasionally being spread in electronic form about the faithful slave.

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:12.019
This has caused some concern on the part of some brothers,

00:14:12.019 --> 00:14:16.220
especially when the reports are commenting on court cases

00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:20.120
where some in the organization were accused.

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:25.320
Sometimes references made to certain quotes and readers then think,

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:28.019
how can a quote be a rumor?

00:14:28.019 --> 00:14:31.320
A quote can be taken out of context.

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:38.919
Critical reports often give only part of a matter and leave out other aspects.

00:14:38.919 --> 00:14:43.820
Often such rumors play on the emotions.

00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:47.820
Ask yourself, am I prone to believe rumors?

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:56.919
And even if I am, should I spread it and undermine the trust that others have in the slave or in representative

00:14:56.919 --> 00:14:59.820
of the branch office?

00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:03.220
Avoid sensationalism by saying something like,

00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:06.919
can you believe what I heard about this matter or that matter?

00:15:06.919 --> 00:15:16.820
Or this person or that person referring to a statement that may have appeared on Facebook, YouTube or Twitter?

00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:22.019
The spread of rumors is like wildfire that is hard to control.

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:27.120
It spreads distrust and can undermine someone's faith.

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:31.720
This is not to say that the slave is perfect and never makes mistakes,

00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:38.419
but Jehovah and Jesus trust the imperfect slave who cares for things to the best of his ability

00:15:38.419 --> 00:15:41.320
and with the best of motives.

00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:47.059
Shouldn't we then trust the imperfect slave as well?

00:15:47.059 --> 00:15:52.059
To appreciate the extent of Jehovah's and Jesus trust in the faithful slave

00:15:52.059 --> 00:15:55.960
reflect on what he has promised its members.

00:15:55.960 --> 00:16:01.259
He has promised them immortality and incorruption.

00:16:01.259 --> 00:16:07.960
Soon, just before Armageddon, the remaining members of the slave will be taken to heaven.

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:15.360
Since 1919 of our common era, the slave has been put in charge of some belongings of Christ.

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:20.659
According to Matthew 24, 47, when the anointed are taken to heaven,

00:16:20.659 --> 00:16:27.259
Jesus will at that point in trust all His belongings to them.

00:16:27.259 --> 00:16:32.559
Does this not reveal immense trust?

00:16:32.559 --> 00:16:39.759
Revelation 4.4 describes these resurrected anointed as co-rulers with Christ.

00:16:39.759 --> 00:16:45.860
Revelation 22.5 says they will rule not only for a thousand years,

00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:50.159
but for ever and ever.

00:16:50.159 --> 00:16:55.639
What immense trust Jesus shows toward them.

00:16:55.639 --> 00:17:01.639
Since Jehovah God and Jesus Christ completely trust the faithful and discreet slave,

00:17:01.639 --> 00:17:06.319
should we not do the same?

00:17:06.319 --> 00:17:14.019
Many servants of Jehovah in the past show trust in Jehovah when confronted with obstacles or opposition.

00:17:14.019 --> 00:17:18.920
We can trust that Jehovah will not let us be tested beyond what we can bear,

00:17:19.019 --> 00:17:25.720
but will provide a way out so we can remain faithful under trials.

00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:28.819
So whom do you trust?

00:17:28.819 --> 00:17:34.720
You fully trust in Jehovah, Jesus, and the faithful slave.

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:40.220
To a reasonable degree, you also trust all your fellow brothers and sisters.

00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:46.019
The writer of Psalm 142 mentions something else we need to trust in.

00:17:46.019 --> 00:17:48.519
God's Word.

00:17:48.519 --> 00:17:53.319
He wrote, for I put my trust in your Word.

00:17:53.319 --> 00:17:58.420
The prophecies in God's Word have always come true at the proper time.

00:17:58.420 --> 00:18:06.720
Based on that, we can trust fully that the remaining prophecies pointing to the survival of the great tribulation

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:16.029
and to the paradise to follow will also come true without the slightest possibility of failure.

00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:21.329
Of course, we should trust not only Jehovah, Jesus, the faithful slave, and the Bible,

00:18:21.329 --> 00:18:24.529
but also our fellow brothers.

00:18:24.529 --> 00:18:27.529
The Apostle Paul is a fine example of this.

00:18:27.529 --> 00:18:35.430
He wrote in Philemon, or two, Philemon, asking him to kindly receive back the runaway slave

00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:38.529
on SMS that had become a brother.

00:18:38.529 --> 00:18:42.829
Paul wrote in Philemon 21,

00:18:42.829 --> 00:18:50.529
I'm confident that you will comply, so I'm writing you, knowing that you will do even more than what I say.

00:18:50.529 --> 00:18:59.710
When we speak of trust, we sometimes think of a little child, a walking hand in hand with his father.

00:18:59.710 --> 00:19:03.609
The child does not question whether father will take him.

00:19:03.609 --> 00:19:06.410
The child trusts the father.

00:19:06.410 --> 00:19:13.410
All throughout the last days, true Christians have faced hostility of so many in the world.

00:19:13.509 --> 00:19:20.009
How strengthening Jehovah's promises in view of the impending attack by Satan's hordes?

00:19:20.009 --> 00:19:24.710
When they attack, Jehovah's people will seem as defenseless,

00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:27.210
but we do not need to quake with fear.

00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:34.109
We trust that Jehovah, Jesus, and the angels will fight to deliver us.

00:19:34.109 --> 00:19:37.509
We will not shrink back in fear.

00:19:37.609 --> 00:19:39.910
In Hebrews 10, 39, Paul wrote,

00:19:39.910 --> 00:19:43.410
Now we are not the sort who shrink back to destruction,

00:19:43.410 --> 00:19:48.009
but the sort who have faith for the preserving of our lives.

00:19:48.009 --> 00:19:49.910
Today and after Armageddon,

00:19:49.910 --> 00:19:55.009
all can say according to Psalm 261 and 52, 8,

00:19:55.009 --> 00:19:58.410
I have trusted in Jehovah without wavering.

00:19:58.410 --> 00:20:04.109
My trust is in God's loyal love forever and ever.

00:20:04.109 --> 00:20:09.509
Therefore, keep trusting in Jehovah and those who are proving loyal to Him.

00:20:09.509 --> 00:20:12.309
Back to you, Leon.

00:20:12.309 --> 00:20:14.210
Thank you, Brother Lush.

00:20:14.210 --> 00:20:17.210
In line with that, we all want good friends.

00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:19.509
We can trust.

00:20:19.509 --> 00:20:23.410
The type mentioned at the parlor, 1824,

00:20:23.410 --> 00:20:28.910
where it says there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother.

00:20:28.910 --> 00:20:34.910
But at times, we may find that a close friend needs spiritual help.

00:20:34.910 --> 00:20:39.609
Do we fear losing that friendship if we speak up?

00:20:39.609 --> 00:20:42.710
What does Jehovah want us to do?

00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:45.210
In the following dramatization,

00:20:45.210 --> 00:21:04.720
the young man Danny faces these same questions.

00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:07.619
I had a secret.

00:21:07.619 --> 00:21:09.119
Only.

00:21:09.119 --> 00:21:12.299
It wasn't mine to tell.

00:21:12.299 --> 00:21:14.200
It was my best friends.

00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:28.269
Julian.

00:21:28.269 --> 00:21:47.029
This was not the Julian I knew.

00:21:47.029 --> 00:21:48.730
At the end of the meeting,

00:21:48.730 --> 00:21:53.099
Brother Max wanted to know if I was okay.

00:21:53.099 --> 00:21:55.000
I shrugged it off.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:06.730
I just didn't know who to talk to at that point.

00:22:06.730 --> 00:22:09.839
A few years ago,

00:22:09.839 --> 00:22:21.529
my parents stopped attending meetings.

00:22:21.529 --> 00:22:45.220
Julian was there for me.

00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:50.059
I didn't want to lose my friend,

00:22:50.059 --> 00:23:07.220
but did I really know him?

00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:13.880
I decided to ask Julian about the pictures he posted.

00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:16.180
I told him it wasn't right.

00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:19.680
He needed to talk to the elders.

00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:28.210
Then he got really defensive about it.

00:23:28.210 --> 00:23:33.829
I knew I did the right thing.

00:23:33.829 --> 00:23:52.619
I just needed someone to talk to.

00:23:52.619 --> 00:23:57.119
Brother Max wanted to know how I was really doing.

00:23:57.119 --> 00:24:00.619
He could tell something was wrong.

00:24:00.619 --> 00:24:02.619
So...

00:24:02.619 --> 00:24:13.150
I opened up.

00:24:13.150 --> 00:24:15.250
I told him everything.

00:24:15.250 --> 00:24:17.950
I didn't want to get my friend in trouble.

00:24:17.950 --> 00:24:20.750
Max understood.

00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:29.039
He asked me to read James 5 verses 14 and 15.

00:24:29.039 --> 00:24:33.069
Is there anyone sick among you?

00:24:33.069 --> 00:24:37.480
Let him call the elders of the congregation to him.

00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:40.079
And let them pray over him,

00:24:40.079 --> 00:24:45.079
applying oil to him in the name of Jehovah.

00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:50.180
And the prayer of faith will make this sick one well.

00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:56.599
And Jehovah will raise him up.

00:24:56.599 --> 00:24:59.400
Max showed me that the elders can encourage

00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:03.599
and strengthen a spiritually weak person.

00:25:03.599 --> 00:25:05.299
Covering up a friend's wrongdoing

00:25:05.299 --> 00:25:10.819
prevents him from getting the spiritual help he needs.

00:25:10.819 --> 00:25:12.420
All this time,

00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:16.119
I was focused on Julian and his deception.

00:25:16.119 --> 00:25:20.680
And I didn't speak up.

00:25:20.779 --> 00:25:24.480
I'm glad I was honest with Brother Max.

00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:27.779
The elders are like your spiritual doctors.

00:25:27.779 --> 00:25:29.279
And even more,

00:25:29.279 --> 00:25:30.779
there are friends.

00:25:30.779 --> 00:25:33.279
They want to help us.

00:25:33.279 --> 00:25:35.480
Julian might receive discipline,

00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:38.480
but that's an expression of Jehovah's love.

00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:46.759
It could save his spiritual life.

00:25:46.759 --> 00:25:59.420
Julian got the spiritual help he needed.

00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:14.539
And I kept my best friend.

00:26:14.539 --> 00:26:17.339
Did you notice how our young brother

00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:22.140
put trust in the Bible and acted accordingly?

00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:26.140
How can we do the same?

00:26:26.140 --> 00:26:28.839
Brother Ron Kerzen's morning worship comment.

00:26:28.839 --> 00:26:32.339
Share some thoughts on specific ways

00:26:32.339 --> 00:26:35.339
we can continue to make spiritual adjustments

00:26:35.339 --> 00:26:40.740
as we encounter a variety of life challenges.

00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:42.539
These are very practical comments.

00:26:42.539 --> 00:26:45.539
And they all tie in well with what the Apostle Paul

00:26:45.539 --> 00:26:49.940
was trying to tell those in the Ephesian congregation

00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:51.940
about examining themselves.

00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:54.039
The same way we have to do today.

00:26:54.039 --> 00:26:56.740
Examining ourselves so that we please Jehovah.

00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:59.839
If you'd like, please open up to Ephesians chapter 5

00:26:59.839 --> 00:27:04.769
and we'll read verse 10, which is our theme scripture.

00:27:04.769 --> 00:27:07.670
Ephesians chapter 5 and verse 10.

00:27:07.670 --> 00:27:11.869
It says keep on making sure of what is acceptable to the Lord.

00:27:11.869 --> 00:27:13.869
And then it goes on in verse 11

00:27:13.869 --> 00:27:16.970
and stop sharing in the unfruitful works

00:27:16.970 --> 00:27:18.670
that belong to the darkness,

00:27:18.670 --> 00:27:23.670
rather expose them for what they are.

00:27:23.670 --> 00:27:28.869
So it's very clear to us in this chapter of Ephesians chapter 5

00:27:28.869 --> 00:27:32.269
that there are things that Jehovah views as acceptable

00:27:32.269 --> 00:27:35.369
and he views as unacceptable.

00:27:35.369 --> 00:27:38.170
Jehovah's standard of what is unacceptable

00:27:38.170 --> 00:27:41.569
is outlined in quite a few of the verses in chapter 5 here.

00:27:41.569 --> 00:27:46.569
If you would just scan through verse 3, 4 and 5

00:27:46.670 --> 00:27:51.569
we'll see that unwholesome talk about sex, shameful conduct,

00:27:51.569 --> 00:27:55.970
obscene gesting, and then verse 18, drunkenness.

00:27:55.970 --> 00:28:00.970
Well, these are things that will bar us from God's kingdom.

00:28:00.970 --> 00:28:02.670
When you think about entertainment today,

00:28:02.670 --> 00:28:05.269
it's merely impossible to try to find something

00:28:05.269 --> 00:28:07.569
that is acceptable to Jehovah

00:28:07.569 --> 00:28:10.869
that does not have immoral sex, pornography,

00:28:10.869 --> 00:28:13.369
spiritism, and violence.

00:28:13.369 --> 00:28:16.269
Satan has thoroughly saturated all forms

00:28:16.269 --> 00:28:19.869
of the media, so thoroughly that it's in our literatures

00:28:19.869 --> 00:28:21.769
and movies, it's in electronic games

00:28:21.769 --> 00:28:23.569
or everything that we can think of.

00:28:23.569 --> 00:28:25.569
Satan has infiltrated.

00:28:26.670 --> 00:28:29.970
Yes, he knows that Jehovah hates these things

00:28:29.970 --> 00:28:34.170
and he doesn't mind if part of our heart hates these things

00:28:34.170 --> 00:28:37.869
as long as part of our heart loves these things.

00:28:37.869 --> 00:28:40.269
So we do well to ask ourselves,

00:28:40.269 --> 00:28:42.569
does the entertainment that I choose?

00:28:42.569 --> 00:28:46.869
Does it help me in my being acceptable to Jehovah?

00:28:46.869 --> 00:28:49.769
Does it help me to have the qualities

00:28:49.769 --> 00:28:54.369
that Jehovah endures in us and will draw closer to us?

00:28:54.369 --> 00:28:57.269
Well, the spirit of the world reflects rebellion

00:28:57.269 --> 00:29:00.869
of the Bible, which outlines Jehovah's qualities

00:29:00.869 --> 00:29:02.670
and his standards.

00:29:02.670 --> 00:29:04.869
We want to show respect for the Bible,

00:29:04.869 --> 00:29:08.069
which teaches us to love what Jehovah loves

00:29:08.069 --> 00:29:10.970
and hate what he hates.

00:29:10.970 --> 00:29:12.869
And what will help us to do this

00:29:12.869 --> 00:29:14.970
and resist the spirit of the world

00:29:14.970 --> 00:29:18.170
and draw closer to Jehovah and be acceptable to him?

00:29:18.170 --> 00:29:23.930
Let's notice verse 17, chapter 5 and verse 17.

00:29:23.930 --> 00:29:26.630
It says on this account, stop being unreasonable,

00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:31.930
but keep perceiving what the will of Jehovah is.

00:29:31.930 --> 00:29:33.630
We need to constantly think,

00:29:33.630 --> 00:29:36.230
what would Jehovah want me to do?

00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:39.430
Well, verse 1 and verse 2 helps us to appreciate this.

00:29:39.529 --> 00:29:43.029
It says, become imitators of God as beloved children

00:29:43.029 --> 00:29:47.329
and go on walking in love just as the Christ also loved us.

00:29:47.329 --> 00:29:50.230
He gave himself up for us as an offering

00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:54.329
and a sacrifice, a sweet fragrance to God.

00:29:54.329 --> 00:29:58.630
So bottom line, we need to imitate Jehovah and Jesus.

00:29:58.630 --> 00:30:04.329
Our sacrifices need to be acceptable to Jehovah as was Jesus.

00:30:04.329 --> 00:30:07.130
What made Jesus so pleasing?

00:30:07.130 --> 00:30:10.829
Well, he did everything way Jehovah wanted him to do.

00:30:10.829 --> 00:30:14.329
In fact, he said something that we want to say one day,

00:30:14.329 --> 00:30:17.230
I always do the things pleasing to him.

00:30:17.230 --> 00:30:20.329
And one day in perfection, we will be able to say that.

00:30:20.329 --> 00:30:24.630
Jesus was pleasing in his word, in his deed, in his actions.

00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:28.730
Well, how can we imitate Jesus and thus imitate Jehovah?

00:30:28.730 --> 00:30:31.529
Well, let's briefly discuss three ways.

00:30:31.529 --> 00:30:34.829
First, pray for God's Holy Spirit.

00:30:34.829 --> 00:30:37.730
When confronted with trials, what did Jesus do?

00:30:37.730 --> 00:30:39.529
He did not rely on himself.

00:30:39.529 --> 00:30:41.829
He petitioned Jehovah for help.

00:30:41.829 --> 00:30:44.329
So if we're struggling with a temptation,

00:30:44.329 --> 00:30:46.430
a certain fleshly weakness,

00:30:46.430 --> 00:30:49.230
it's vital that we do the same.

00:30:49.230 --> 00:30:50.730
We can also talk to the elders,

00:30:50.730 --> 00:30:53.329
our loving shepherds who will pray with us

00:30:53.329 --> 00:30:56.430
and they will definitely help us to remain faithful

00:30:56.430 --> 00:30:59.329
with words of encouragement.

00:30:59.329 --> 00:31:03.329
Number two, obey Jehovah completely.

00:31:03.329 --> 00:31:06.630
Jesus always did things that were pleasing to his father.

00:31:06.630 --> 00:31:09.029
Luke 22, 42 said,

00:31:09.029 --> 00:31:12.730
let not my will, but yours take place.

00:31:12.730 --> 00:31:15.829
Remember, there's no substitute for obedience.

00:31:15.829 --> 00:31:19.329
We cannot be acceptable without obedience.

00:31:19.329 --> 00:31:22.829
Number three, know the scriptures well.

00:31:22.829 --> 00:31:25.829
Jesus used God's word as his authority.

00:31:25.829 --> 00:31:29.730
His whole life revolved around knowing and obeying

00:31:29.730 --> 00:31:32.730
and encouraging others about God's laws.

00:31:32.829 --> 00:31:34.630
We all have busy schedules.

00:31:34.630 --> 00:31:37.630
We have work to do, busy in a congregation.

00:31:37.630 --> 00:31:39.630
It's more than just trying to find time

00:31:39.630 --> 00:31:41.230
to dig deep into God's word.

00:31:41.230 --> 00:31:43.829
We must make the time.

00:31:43.829 --> 00:31:49.230
So what do our schedules tell us about our love for Jehovah,

00:31:49.230 --> 00:31:51.829
our love for his word?

00:31:51.829 --> 00:31:54.230
Do we read the Bible daily?

00:31:54.230 --> 00:31:58.230
And if we do, how much time do we take to let it sink

00:31:58.230 --> 00:32:02.730
into our mind and our heart and to meditate?

00:32:02.730 --> 00:32:05.230
Are we content with just looking at the basics,

00:32:05.230 --> 00:32:10.930
the surface or digging deep and deep below the surface?

00:32:10.930 --> 00:32:14.029
It's vital that we train our minds and our hearts,

00:32:14.029 --> 00:32:16.930
but it takes time and it takes effort.

00:32:16.930 --> 00:32:18.730
Just as a marathon runner must devote

00:32:18.730 --> 00:32:23.029
much time and effort to his training to run a race.

00:32:23.029 --> 00:32:25.230
In fact, as we know, Christians are like

00:32:25.230 --> 00:32:27.630
into running a race and it's a race for life.

00:32:27.730 --> 00:32:29.630
Let's see whether Apostle Paul had to tell us

00:32:29.630 --> 00:32:34.180
if we go over to first Corinthians.

00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:36.380
First Corinthians chapter nine,

00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:38.579
scripture we know very well.

00:32:38.579 --> 00:32:40.880
And we'll start in verse 24.

00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:43.680
There's a few key elements that we would like to extract

00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:45.380
as we're reading these verses.

00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:46.880
Here Paul said,

00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:49.579
do you know that the runners in a race all run

00:32:49.579 --> 00:32:52.380
but only one receives the prize?

00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:56.279
Run in such a way that you may win it.

00:32:56.279 --> 00:32:58.480
Now, everyone competing in a contest,

00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:01.279
exercises self-control in all things.

00:33:01.279 --> 00:33:02.380
There's a key.

00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:05.480
Of course, they do not receive a crown that can perish,

00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:08.079
but one that does not perish.

00:33:08.079 --> 00:33:11.579
Therefore, the way I am running is not aimlessly.

00:33:11.579 --> 00:33:15.480
The way I am aiming my blows is so as not to strike,

00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:16.980
striking the air,

00:33:16.980 --> 00:33:20.279
but I pummel my body and the footnote says,

00:33:20.279 --> 00:33:24.279
punish strictly discipline and lead it as a slave.

00:33:24.279 --> 00:33:26.579
So that after I have preached to others,

00:33:26.579 --> 00:33:29.880
I myself should not become disapproved

00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:33.480
or the footnote says disqualified somehow.

00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:38.480
So we definitely want to have self-control like a runner.

00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:40.579
We need to say no to Satan's world

00:33:40.579 --> 00:33:43.880
and yes to things that are acceptable to Jehovah.

00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:46.079
And we definitely want to make sure

00:33:46.079 --> 00:33:50.380
that we are acceptable and never to be disapproved.

00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:52.279
Perhaps we can illustrate this

00:33:52.279 --> 00:33:55.579
in a 1994 New York City marathon.

00:33:55.579 --> 00:33:58.279
There was a young man named Hermann Silva

00:33:58.279 --> 00:34:01.079
and he ran an outstanding race.

00:34:01.079 --> 00:34:03.180
In fact, there was only a half mile

00:34:03.180 --> 00:34:05.079
to the finish line in Central Park

00:34:05.079 --> 00:34:07.180
and somehow he got distracted.

00:34:07.180 --> 00:34:08.579
He took the wrong path.

00:34:09.679 --> 00:34:10.780
Did he lose the race?

00:34:10.780 --> 00:34:12.980
Well, the lead runner took over.

00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:14.780
Well, he got redirected.

00:34:14.780 --> 00:34:16.380
He went back on the path.

00:34:16.380 --> 00:34:18.980
He began to run faster and faster.

00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:20.980
He passed up the lead runner

00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:24.980
and he won the New York City Marathon in two seconds.

00:34:24.980 --> 00:34:26.579
What does this tell us?

00:34:26.579 --> 00:34:29.079
It tells us that sometimes we can lose our focus.

00:34:29.079 --> 00:34:30.679
We can be sidetracked

00:34:30.679 --> 00:34:34.780
or we could get involved in unacceptable conduct

00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:37.179
but allow God's word and loving shepherds

00:34:37.179 --> 00:34:41.280
to readjust our course, never give up.

00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:43.980
Just a few years later after that, 1997,

00:34:43.980 --> 00:34:47.280
Hermann began running again in a New York City marathon.

00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:50.480
He thought he had this one all in the bag.

00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:52.280
He thought he was going to win this race

00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:54.480
but he started to run slower.

00:34:54.579 --> 00:34:57.079
He began to dehydrate it.

00:34:57.079 --> 00:35:00.480
Instead of taking just a few seconds to hydrate,

00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:01.579
he skipped that.

00:35:01.579 --> 00:35:02.980
He thought he could do it.

00:35:02.980 --> 00:35:05.079
Well, what could this tell us?

00:35:05.079 --> 00:35:07.179
Well, we cannot afford to take shortcuts.

00:35:07.179 --> 00:35:10.480
We need to have a regular intake of spiritual food

00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:13.079
to keep pace with Jehovah's organization.

00:35:13.079 --> 00:35:16.079
We do this by what the commenters told us today.

00:35:16.079 --> 00:35:19.880
That is a regular intake of God's word and meditation.

00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:22.780
As we run the Christian course, the race for life.

00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:26.179
Remember, it's not the speed, it's the direction.

00:35:26.179 --> 00:35:28.079
That's what matters the most.

00:35:28.079 --> 00:35:30.179
I mean, we always run in such a way

00:35:30.179 --> 00:35:32.179
that is acceptable to Jehovah.

00:35:33.380 --> 00:35:35.880
As Brother Curza mentioned,

00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:39.679
certainly a regular intake of God's word

00:35:39.679 --> 00:35:42.679
can have a dramatic effect on our lives.

00:35:43.679 --> 00:35:46.980
Take the example of Raphika Morris.

00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:50.679
Her life later on asserts her ways

00:35:50.679 --> 00:35:55.679
to achieve racial harmony through human means.

00:35:56.679 --> 00:36:00.480
But after years of frustration and disappointments,

00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:03.880
how would studying the Bible affect

00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:09.130
her search for answers?

00:36:09.130 --> 00:36:10.929
Growing up in the South,

00:36:10.929 --> 00:36:12.929
during the time of segregation,

00:36:14.429 --> 00:36:18.429
blacks and whites, we couldn't mix.

00:36:18.429 --> 00:36:19.530
And not only that,

00:36:19.530 --> 00:36:21.929
they had signs to keep you knowing

00:36:21.929 --> 00:36:23.630
where you're supposed to go.

00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:27.030
I couldn't understand why we couldn't get along.

00:36:28.829 --> 00:36:29.829
Good to see you.

00:36:29.829 --> 00:36:30.630
Yes, sir.

00:36:32.329 --> 00:36:33.829
Thank you, sir.

00:36:33.829 --> 00:36:35.730
Grandma, he's just a boy.

00:36:35.730 --> 00:36:37.429
Why are you saying, sir?

00:36:37.429 --> 00:36:38.130
Be quiet.

00:36:38.130 --> 00:36:40.130
I want you to know your place.

00:36:41.730 --> 00:36:43.630
I told her after we got back on the truck,

00:36:43.630 --> 00:36:44.429
you know what?

00:36:44.429 --> 00:36:47.429
I'll never hold my head down, you know.

00:36:47.429 --> 00:36:48.230
My grandmother,

00:36:48.230 --> 00:36:49.630
she knew I had a love for the Bible

00:36:49.630 --> 00:36:54.659
because I would always read the Bible as a kid.

00:36:54.659 --> 00:37:02.199
But I couldn't understand it.

00:37:02.199 --> 00:37:03.099
I used to pray,

00:37:03.099 --> 00:37:04.699
what makes us so different?

00:37:05.699 --> 00:37:12.030
You know, why we can't live together?

00:37:12.030 --> 00:37:13.230
I met a group.

00:37:14.630 --> 00:37:16.230
And this group was like,

00:37:16.230 --> 00:37:19.230
what I really wanted to be in.

00:37:19.230 --> 00:37:22.230
It was about politics.

00:37:22.230 --> 00:37:24.030
They said we fight injustice.

00:37:24.030 --> 00:37:26.530
And when they said that we're injustice,

00:37:26.530 --> 00:37:27.929
it was like, yeah,

00:37:27.929 --> 00:37:30.030
this is what I want to be in, right?

00:37:31.130 --> 00:37:32.630
Be part of something that could change

00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:34.829
and make people unite it, right?

00:37:34.829 --> 00:37:35.929
That was my goal.

00:37:38.989 --> 00:37:41.590
We started protesting about police brutality.

00:37:41.590 --> 00:37:44.190
And I think that's what a lot of people,

00:37:44.190 --> 00:37:46.289
you know, was focusing on.

00:37:47.590 --> 00:37:50.190
I liked some of the things that they was doing.

00:37:50.190 --> 00:37:51.989
But they've trained us every, every day

00:37:51.989 --> 00:37:53.789
in a military training,

00:37:53.789 --> 00:37:56.590
learn how to use weapons and stuff like that.

00:37:56.590 --> 00:37:58.190
And so I'm thinking like,

00:37:58.190 --> 00:37:59.789
this is not what I want to be in.

00:37:59.789 --> 00:38:01.690
This is not what I join.

00:38:01.690 --> 00:38:05.090
So I start like going back to God again,

00:38:05.090 --> 00:38:06.789
to read the Bible because it's like,

00:38:06.789 --> 00:38:08.489
I'm not changing anything.

00:38:08.489 --> 00:38:11.889
The Bible that I was reading was a King James Version.

00:38:11.889 --> 00:38:13.789
So I was reading it, reading it, reading it.

00:38:13.789 --> 00:38:15.989
But I couldn't understand it.

00:38:15.989 --> 00:38:17.989
We went to Jamaica.

00:38:17.989 --> 00:38:19.389
And I saw this Bible,

00:38:19.389 --> 00:38:20.889
the New World translation.

00:38:20.889 --> 00:38:23.789
And I started reading it and it made so much sense.

00:38:23.789 --> 00:38:26.489
I could understand it and it wasn't the end of it.

00:38:26.489 --> 00:38:28.889
I was like, wow.

00:38:28.889 --> 00:38:31.489
You know, like, this is the one I want to get.

00:38:31.489 --> 00:38:33.690
One day two women knocked on the door.

00:38:34.989 --> 00:38:36.789
I didn't know David's Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:38:36.789 --> 00:38:39.590
All I could see was a Bible.

00:38:39.590 --> 00:38:42.090
And I said, what did you get the Bible from?

00:38:42.090 --> 00:38:44.489
And they said, okay, we'll bring you one.

00:38:44.489 --> 00:38:45.289
And they did.

00:38:45.289 --> 00:38:46.389
So they brought me the Bible.

00:38:46.389 --> 00:38:47.989
But I didn't know I was going to have

00:38:47.989 --> 00:38:50.090
a Bible study come along with it.

00:38:51.789 --> 00:38:53.590
The first time I went to a convention

00:38:53.590 --> 00:38:54.989
about Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:38:54.989 --> 00:38:57.889
it was like 10,000 people.

00:38:57.889 --> 00:39:00.389
When I go in there and I see all these

00:39:00.389 --> 00:39:02.289
different faces and different colors,

00:39:02.289 --> 00:39:05.389
it's like Jehovah showing me like, hey, Rafika.

00:39:05.389 --> 00:39:06.989
Remember you asked me about

00:39:06.989 --> 00:39:09.289
all different people getting together

00:39:09.289 --> 00:39:12.289
and being one, see, I'm not partial.

00:39:12.289 --> 00:39:13.289
They do get along.

00:39:13.289 --> 00:39:14.690
We are unified.

00:39:14.690 --> 00:39:18.190
And it just made me feel so good inside.

00:39:18.190 --> 00:39:22.690
Yes, this is the organization that I want to be in.

00:39:23.889 --> 00:39:26.889
I just see people as people, you know.

00:39:27.889 --> 00:39:31.590
And I can be friends with anybody.

00:39:33.289 --> 00:39:36.090
Now that I know what the Bible really teaches,

00:39:36.090 --> 00:39:38.190
I have a wonderful life.

00:39:38.190 --> 00:39:41.190
Because I know that I'm the only God

00:39:41.190 --> 00:39:43.389
in his government can bring about peace.

00:39:45.090 --> 00:39:47.389
Just like I do with unified everybody,

00:39:47.389 --> 00:39:49.690
all like for everybody to be unified

00:39:49.690 --> 00:39:51.190
and come to know Jehovah,

00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:52.489
just like I know him.

00:39:53.690 --> 00:40:05.400
Jehovah, that's my prayer.

00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:09.099
While Rafika faced unique challenges

00:40:09.099 --> 00:40:11.500
early in her spiritual life,

00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:14.099
she learned to trust in Jehovah.

00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:17.599
Trust is also needed.

00:40:17.599 --> 00:40:19.900
If we choose to extend ourselves

00:40:19.900 --> 00:40:22.199
in a new form of kingdom service,

00:40:22.199 --> 00:40:24.500
this is especially true.

00:40:24.500 --> 00:40:26.300
Of those who have had the privilege

00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:29.900
to attend a school for kingdom evangelizers.

00:40:29.900 --> 00:40:36.489
Their personal experiences confirm this.

00:40:37.389 --> 00:40:40.190
I have an illness that affects my level of energy.

00:40:40.190 --> 00:40:41.690
So I didn't feel that I could accept

00:40:41.690 --> 00:40:43.590
just any kind of assignment.

00:40:45.590 --> 00:40:47.889
Since the end of this system is near,

00:40:47.889 --> 00:40:50.190
I want to do whatever I can

00:40:50.190 --> 00:40:52.889
that Jehovah wants down to the very end.

00:40:52.889 --> 00:40:54.190
So I applied.

00:40:55.190 --> 00:40:58.190
Before attending SKE when I received my invitation,

00:40:58.190 --> 00:41:00.690
all of a sudden I had challenges

00:41:00.690 --> 00:41:01.789
or worries about myself.

00:41:01.789 --> 00:41:05.289
I felt unworthy, even unqualified.

00:41:06.289 --> 00:41:07.489
Being a single sister,

00:41:07.489 --> 00:41:11.090
going into the class with so many couples,

00:41:11.090 --> 00:41:15.409
I thought I would be out of place.

00:41:17.909 --> 00:41:20.409
I used all my abilities.

00:41:21.710 --> 00:41:23.909
I felt like my head was swelling up.

00:41:25.510 --> 00:41:29.110
Even so, I felt that I was really being refined

00:41:29.110 --> 00:41:32.110
and ended each day feeling fulfilled.

00:41:35.429 --> 00:41:37.929
Something that I really enjoyed about SKE

00:41:37.929 --> 00:41:39.829
was Friday afternoons.

00:41:39.829 --> 00:41:41.530
That's when we had a talk

00:41:41.530 --> 00:41:43.730
from one of the governing body members.

00:41:43.730 --> 00:41:44.730
That was special.

00:41:46.030 --> 00:41:47.730
During the eight weeks of school,

00:41:47.730 --> 00:41:49.230
such an emphasis was placed

00:41:49.230 --> 00:41:51.230
on serving with a needy-scrater.

00:41:51.230 --> 00:41:53.730
So this way of thinking became more important to us.

00:41:54.630 --> 00:41:56.429
After eight weeks attending the school,

00:41:56.429 --> 00:41:59.130
you are even ready to be set to the moon.

00:41:59.130 --> 00:42:01.730
When I was told that my next assignment

00:42:01.730 --> 00:42:04.329
would be in Mesa, Arizona,

00:42:04.329 --> 00:42:06.130
I thought, where is that?

00:42:06.130 --> 00:42:08.630
And then I thought, oh no, scorpions.

00:42:09.130 --> 00:42:10.829
And then I thought, okay,

00:42:10.829 --> 00:42:12.329
this is where to hold what things I should be,

00:42:12.329 --> 00:42:13.630
so I'm ready to go.

00:42:15.130 --> 00:42:17.030
One of the challenges in my new assignment

00:42:17.030 --> 00:42:19.630
was finding suitable accommodation.

00:42:19.630 --> 00:42:21.329
There was a couple in the congregation.

00:42:21.329 --> 00:42:24.030
They had two rooms that they rented

00:42:24.030 --> 00:42:25.530
in the back of their property,

00:42:25.530 --> 00:42:27.230
but it needed some renovations.

00:42:27.230 --> 00:42:29.329
So the brothers very quickly came together,

00:42:29.329 --> 00:42:30.329
helped, sorted out,

00:42:30.329 --> 00:42:34.530
and even build an extra little kitchenette lounge.

00:42:34.530 --> 00:42:36.230
So now we have a beautiful little home

00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:37.530
and to go back to,

00:42:37.530 --> 00:42:40.530
offer a long, hot day in the ministry.

00:42:40.530 --> 00:42:43.030
I always thought that I'd do much better in cold

00:42:43.030 --> 00:42:44.230
than I would in heat.

00:42:44.230 --> 00:42:47.230
So the brothers and sisters were very helpful

00:42:47.230 --> 00:42:49.530
in making sure that I stayed hydrated,

00:42:49.530 --> 00:42:53.329
making sure I knew how to handle myself in the heat,

00:42:53.329 --> 00:42:55.530
giving me pointers of things to carry,

00:42:55.530 --> 00:42:59.130
and they made sure that I had an extra large,

00:42:59.130 --> 00:43:01.030
water bottle with me.

00:43:01.030 --> 00:43:04.530
We really felt supported by the congregation

00:43:04.530 --> 00:43:07.030
because they found us an apartment.

00:43:07.030 --> 00:43:12.920
This meant that we could concentrate on our ministry.

00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:15.019
One of the things that really helped me

00:43:15.019 --> 00:43:16.920
was an experienced brother

00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:18.420
who gave an encouraging comment

00:43:18.420 --> 00:43:22.119
about whether my health would permit me to attend the school.

00:43:22.119 --> 00:43:24.519
He said, if she can pioneer,

00:43:24.519 --> 00:43:29.510
then it's also possible for her to attend the school.

00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:32.809
The education that we received at SKE,

00:43:32.809 --> 00:43:35.210
especially it helped us with our qualities,

00:43:35.210 --> 00:43:38.110
our personality, putting on a new personality,

00:43:38.110 --> 00:43:40.909
that really will help us not only now in our assignment,

00:43:40.909 --> 00:43:45.530
but right through into the new world.

00:43:45.530 --> 00:43:48.829
I think there are many who could meet the qualifications

00:43:48.829 --> 00:43:51.630
with just a little more effort.

00:43:51.630 --> 00:43:56.130
Please know that there is a wonderful education program

00:43:56.130 --> 00:43:59.329
and we were able to experience it in our 60s.

00:43:59.329 --> 00:44:03.079
We could get through it.

00:44:03.079 --> 00:44:05.980
So if others are thinking of applying,

00:44:05.980 --> 00:44:09.480
I want to tell them that we were able to do it.

00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:13.780
And by all means I want them to taste the same joy

00:44:13.780 --> 00:44:17.510
that we experienced.

00:44:17.510 --> 00:44:20.909
You could be nervous and have performance anxiety

00:44:20.909 --> 00:44:24.210
and worry about how will I handle answering

00:44:24.210 --> 00:44:26.409
and how about all of the student assignments

00:44:26.409 --> 00:44:29.010
and the test worries like that.

00:44:29.010 --> 00:44:30.710
But for my own part,

00:44:30.710 --> 00:44:35.210
it was two months with an incredible amount of joy.

00:44:35.210 --> 00:44:37.409
And you have to focus on that.

00:44:37.409 --> 00:44:38.710
It is a gift.

00:44:38.710 --> 00:44:41.510
It is a wonderful gift from Jehovah.

00:44:41.510 --> 00:44:44.710
I wasn't sure if I was going to put in the application

00:44:44.710 --> 00:44:47.610
because I thought maybe I wanted to do it as a couple

00:44:47.610 --> 00:44:49.309
rather than as a single person.

00:44:49.309 --> 00:44:51.309
But I prayed to Jehovah about it

00:44:51.309 --> 00:44:53.710
and I put my application in.

00:44:53.710 --> 00:44:57.010
I wouldn't be experiencing the happiness that I have now

00:44:57.010 --> 00:44:58.010
if I had waited.

00:44:58.010 --> 00:45:00.809
So I'm happy that I just put my application in

00:45:00.809 --> 00:45:02.610
and let Jehovah do the rest.

00:45:02.610 --> 00:45:04.610
And now sometimes I'm driving down the freeway

00:45:04.610 --> 00:45:07.010
and I think, wow, Jehovah, I'm so happy.

00:45:07.010 --> 00:45:08.010
Thank you.

00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:12.800
These experiences,

00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:16.599
remind me of Colossians chapter 3, verse 23 and 24,

00:45:16.599 --> 00:45:18.199
which reads,

00:45:18.199 --> 00:45:20.099
whatever you're doing,

00:45:20.099 --> 00:45:25.400
work at it whole sold as for Jehovah and not for men.

00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:28.599
For you know that it is from Jehovah,

00:45:28.599 --> 00:45:31.400
you will receive the inheritance as reward,

00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:34.800
slave for the master, Christ.

00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:37.199
And certainly these brothers and sisters

00:45:37.199 --> 00:45:39.400
are doing just that.

00:45:39.400 --> 00:45:43.400
If you personally find yourself in a position

00:45:43.400 --> 00:45:47.400
to reach out for a privilege such as attending this school

00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:50.400
or moving to where the need is great,

00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:54.159
give a consideration.

00:45:54.159 --> 00:45:57.159
Now we travel to Costa Rica

00:45:57.159 --> 00:46:01.159
where we find our brothers and sisters relying on Jehovah

00:46:01.159 --> 00:46:06.159
as they prepare for a very special assembly.

00:46:06.159 --> 00:46:10.159
Why was trust in Jehovah essential

00:46:10.159 --> 00:46:28.800
for this project?

00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:31.800
First, we asked the branch for permission.

00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:33.800
Once they gave us approval,

00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:36.800
we began to make preparations for the assembly,

00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:38.800
though we had absolutely nothing.

00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:42.800
So one brother lent us a property for the assembly set.

00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:46.800
Our brothers have brought many different skills to the project.

00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:50.800
There are metal workers, cabinet makers, and brick layers.

00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:53.800
Many brothers have given up their resources

00:46:53.800 --> 00:46:58.800
and used their abilities so that this project could go ahead.

00:46:58.800 --> 00:47:01.800
This is really made us stand out here.

00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:03.800
People were asking each other,

00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:07.800
what is happening here, and who paid for all of this?

00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:11.800
They say people are surprised at how many workers are coming to help.

00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:15.800
And I wonder, if this is getting attention now,

00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:17.800
what will the assembly be like?

00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:24.239
A comfortable, practical and secure assembly hall was constructed,

00:47:24.239 --> 00:47:26.239
using materials acquired locally.

00:47:26.239 --> 00:47:29.239
Expectation grew as the special day drew closer.

00:47:29.239 --> 00:47:31.239
And when it finally arrived,

00:47:31.239 --> 00:47:35.239
those in attendance experienced something truly moving.

00:47:35.239 --> 00:47:43.239
With Jehovah's help, many interested ones,

00:47:43.239 --> 00:47:45.239
along with our brothers and sisters,

00:47:45.239 --> 00:47:50.239
have come here today to celebrate our first assembly in Brebury language.

00:47:50.239 --> 00:47:54.239
Friends, this is wonderful.

00:47:58.570 --> 00:48:04.880
When the program started in Brebury, I cried.

00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:08.880
I'm so happy to have participated in the assembly,

00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:11.880
especially because it's in my own language.

00:48:11.880 --> 00:48:16.280
It's what we wanted.

00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:19.280
We hope it continues just like this.

00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:24.280
We walked a long way to invite these people.

00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:28.280
And to see them here, it makes me very happy.

00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:39.360
The information presented in the local language touched many hearts.

00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:44.360
This was truly an historic event for our Indigenous brothers in Costa Rica.

00:48:44.360 --> 00:48:49.360
Jehovah has made it possible for more people in this isolated region

00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:53.360
to enjoy his spiritual blessing.

00:48:53.360 --> 00:49:07.389
Did you note why trust in Jehovah was so essential for this project?

00:49:07.389 --> 00:49:11.389
At the start, the brothers had nothing.

00:49:11.389 --> 00:49:15.389
But they trusted that Jehovah would assist him.

00:49:15.389 --> 00:49:22.389
And he did through donated land, materials, and willing volunteers.

00:49:22.389 --> 00:49:26.389
Yes, we can truly put our confidence in Jehovah

00:49:26.389 --> 00:49:30.389
as he guides us through this system of things.

00:49:30.389 --> 00:49:36.389
Such trust in Jehovah is highlighted in this month's music video,

00:49:36.389 --> 00:49:40.389
entitled Confident in You.

00:49:40.389 --> 00:49:52.750
Like a tree planted in the ground,

00:49:52.750 --> 00:50:01.320
your words have sunk deep down into my heart

00:50:01.320 --> 00:50:07.320
and soothed my mind with gentle thoughts of peace.

00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:24.840
This wisdom from all these have these truths to keep.

00:50:24.840 --> 00:50:37.420
Reminding what Jehovah said.

00:50:37.420 --> 00:53:35.510
This month we have seen how trusting in Jehovah and his guidance

00:53:35.510 --> 00:53:38.510
can assist us in a variety of ways.

00:53:38.510 --> 00:53:43.510
Addressing issues with a close friend, our choices in entertainment,

00:53:43.510 --> 00:53:47.510
and even coping with the world filled with social injustice.

00:53:47.510 --> 00:53:52.510
Certainly, Jehovah is someone in whom we can trust.

00:53:52.510 --> 00:53:56.510
But we have one last treat for you before we end our program.

00:53:56.510 --> 00:54:01.510
We'll briefly travel to Katas, Spain.

00:54:01.510 --> 00:54:05.510
Katas is considered to be one of the oldest cities in Western Europe

00:54:05.510 --> 00:54:08.510
and was founded by the Phoenicians.

00:54:08.510 --> 00:54:13.510
It is situated on a narrow slice of land surrounded by the sea.

00:54:13.510 --> 00:54:19.510
Katas has a wealth of vistas and well-preserved historical landmarks.

00:54:20.510 --> 00:54:24.510
On the outskirts lies Puerto de Santa Maria,

00:54:24.510 --> 00:54:27.510
where in English-speaking congregation meets.

00:54:27.510 --> 00:54:33.510
This congregation is made up mainly of brothers and sisters serving as need graders.

00:54:33.510 --> 00:54:36.510
They have come from other parts of Spain,

00:54:36.510 --> 00:54:42.510
as well as distant lands such as Australia, Britain, Canada and the United States.

00:54:42.510 --> 00:54:48.510
Katas has a high rate of unemployment, so finding work is not easy.

00:54:48.510 --> 00:54:56.510
One couple travels nearly 300 miles or 483 kilometers every Thursday to their territory

00:54:56.510 --> 00:55:01.510
and on Monday morning make the trip back to where they live and work.

00:55:01.510 --> 00:55:07.510
In spite of these financial challenges, many are still serving as construction volunteers,

00:55:07.510 --> 00:55:11.510
remote battle workers and pioneers.

00:55:11.510 --> 00:55:17.510
Our brothers and sisters in Puerto de Santa Maria are thrilled to send their love and greetings to you all.

00:55:18.510 --> 00:55:24.510
This is JW Broadcasting from the World Headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses.
