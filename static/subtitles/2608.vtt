00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:07.549
She grew up in a family where she felt invisible.

00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:13.669
And she endured a marriage where she felt unwanted.

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:19.350
In fact, the Bible states that Jacob loved Rachel more

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.309
than her sister, Leah.

00:00:22.309 --> 00:00:24.550
How sad Leah must have felt when she

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:30.589
saw that her younger sister was clearly the favorite.

00:00:30.629 --> 00:00:33.869
And those feelings were not simply imagined.

00:00:33.869 --> 00:00:38.869
At Genesis chapter 29 verse 31, we are told that Jehovah

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:44.469
too saw that Leah was unloved.

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:48.229
Or as the footnote says, loved less.

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:50.869
No doubt Leah suffered with feelings

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:56.710
of insecurity, rejection, and loneliness.

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.909
At first glance, Leah's story may seem to be one

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:05.989
filled mainly with nothing more than disappointment.

00:01:05.989 --> 00:01:12.189
Would she ever become more than just the substitute

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:15.109
in Jacob's eyes?

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:18.790
Well, the Bible's record of Leah takes us on a unique journey.

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.150
Let's take a closer look at her life.

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.510
Let's turn please to Genesis chapter 29.

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:30.349
And let's pick up Leah's story at verse 32.

00:01:30.349 --> 00:01:35.030
Genesis 29 32 says, so Leah became pregnant and gave birth

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.989
to a son and named him Rubin.

00:01:37.989 --> 00:01:45.549
For she said, it is because Jehovah has looked upon my affliction.

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:49.269
For now, my husband will begin to love me.

00:01:49.269 --> 00:01:52.230
And she again became pregnant and gave birth to a son

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:55.950
and then said, it is because Jehovah has listened

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.150
in that I was unloved.

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.030
So he gave me this one also.

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.069
Then she named him Simeon.

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:09.069
And she became pregnant yet again and gave birth to a son

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:13.830
and then said, now this time, my husband would join himself

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.629
to me because I have borne him three sons.

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:24.099
Therefore, he was named Levi.

00:02:24.139 --> 00:02:30.379
Did you notice a pattern in the way she named these first three sons?

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:34.860
She's naming them based on her feelings.

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.580
With each of these sons, she pinned all her hopes of happiness.

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:46.300
And each time, those hopes were dashed miserably.

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:51.500
But Jacob's feelings did not appear to change.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.020
Leah's situation did not change.

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:01.020
She was still the wife less loved, the spare, the substitute.

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:09.139
But now somewhere between the birth of her third and fourth sons,

00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:12.300
something changed for Leah.

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:13.500
What was it?

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.819
Let's pick up the account again in verse 35.

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:22.060
It says, and she became pregnant once more

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:31.060
and gave birth to a son, sorry.

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:39.340
And then said, this time, I will praise Jehovah.

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.659
She therefore named him Judah.

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:46.259
Did you see the difference?

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:50.539
Leah experienced a change of heart.

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:53.819
And this change of heart remained consistent

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:56.659
with the rest of the sons born by her

00:03:56.659 --> 00:03:58.979
and her maidservant, Zilpa.

00:03:58.979 --> 00:04:01.580
Notice how Leah named them.

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:05.300
Gad, with good fortune,

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:09.139
Asher, with my happiness,

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:14.139
Esacar, God has given me my wages in Zebulin.

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:19.980
God has endowed me, yes, me, with a good endowment.

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.620
The names of these sons reveal what?

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:27.060
That Leah shifted her focus

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.139
from seeking the favor of her husband

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:35.759
to more importantly seeking Jehovah's favor.

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:40.439
She stopped longing for what she did not have

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:43.639
and began appreciating what Jehovah was giving her

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:48.639
as she herself said, a good endowment or legacy.

00:04:49.319 --> 00:04:52.240
And while Jacob continued to favor Rachel,

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.519
ahead of Leah for the rest of her life,

00:04:55.519 --> 00:04:57.720
it no longer mattered to Leah

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:03.279
because her outlook had changed.

00:05:03.279 --> 00:05:07.040
No longer was it about her and Jacob,

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.120
but now about her and Jehovah.

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:15.319
And this shift in perspective allowed her to go from,

00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:19.639
whoa is me to how happy I am.

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:24.279
And because of this contented feeling,

00:05:24.279 --> 00:05:28.360
Leah never ran away from her situation

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:33.360
as did Hagar, the maid servant of Sarah.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.759
Nor does she become embittered

00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:41.759
and with wild talk like Job's wife did.

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:47.560
Instead, Leah stayed the course and Jehovah noticed.

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.360
He saw her aching heart.

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.959
And he honored this faithful woman.

00:05:55.959 --> 00:05:56.720
How so?

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:59.920
Not only did Leah become the mother

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:02.920
to half the tribes of Israel,

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:07.079
but two of her sons were who?

00:06:07.079 --> 00:06:11.000
Yes, Judah and Levi.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.360
Who would become the founders of the priestly

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:17.199
and kingly lines of Israel leading directly

00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:19.720
to the Messiah himself?

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:23.879
Centuries later, at Ruth chapter 4 verse 11,

00:06:23.879 --> 00:06:27.120
Leah is mentioned alongside Rachel

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:31.720
as the two women who built the house of Israel.

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:34.800
Leah was no mere substitute.

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:39.800
She became a matriarch and what about Jacob?

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:44.800
Did he ever change in his view of Leah as the wife?

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.920
He loved less?

00:06:46.959 --> 00:06:48.839
We don't know.

00:06:48.839 --> 00:06:50.959
But it's interesting to note

00:06:50.959 --> 00:06:54.680
that when Jacob was delivering his deathbed prophecy,

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:58.319
he expressed his wishes to be laid to rest

00:06:58.319 --> 00:07:01.480
in his family burial site, not in Egypt,

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:06.040
but in the land of Canaan, alongside who?

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:11.040
Let's go to Genesis 49 verse 31 for the answer.

00:07:11.519 --> 00:07:13.680
These are Jacob's own words.

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:17.240
In Genesis 49, 31, he said,

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:21.600
there they buried Abraham and his wife Sarah.

00:07:23.199 --> 00:07:28.040
There they buried Isaac and his wife Rebecca

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:32.600
and there I buried Leah.

00:07:34.199 --> 00:07:36.720
Think about that for a moment.

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:40.959
There is no mention of Rachel being buried there.

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:46.600
We don't know why, but imagine how Leah will feel

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:50.519
when she has resurrected and learns

00:07:50.519 --> 00:07:54.800
that she was included among this very special group

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:57.319
of honored servants of God.

00:07:58.639 --> 00:08:02.360
Well, what lesson can we learn from Leah's story?

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:07.360
First, avoid the snare of thinking,

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:09.399
I'll be happy when.

00:08:10.399 --> 00:08:14.120
Remember true happiness and self-worth comes

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:17.879
from gaining Jehovah's approval in favor,

00:08:17.879 --> 00:08:21.319
more so than that of any imperfect human.

00:08:22.319 --> 00:08:26.480
Second, make it your goal

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:29.600
to make others feel seen.

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:34.039
Do all you can to never let them leave you

00:08:34.039 --> 00:08:40.480
feeling overlooked, but rather appreciate it.

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:45.720
And then next, see the Leahs around you

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:49.440
and your Jehovah will see you.

00:08:51.039 --> 00:08:55.679
Third, remember that life is not always going to be fair.

00:08:56.679 --> 00:09:01.000
Jacob's treatment of Leah could easily be considered

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.639
as unfair, but rather than feeling

00:09:04.639 --> 00:09:06.840
like nothing more than a footnote

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:09.600
to someone else's adventure,

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:13.840
no, Leah allowed Jehovah to write her story

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:15.519
of faith and endurance.

00:09:15.519 --> 00:09:18.080
And it's all right here for us to read

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:19.679
and benefit from today.

00:09:20.559 --> 00:09:25.559
So dear graduates, wherever your spiritual journey takes you,

00:09:27.519 --> 00:09:30.679
remember the faithful woman, Leah.

00:09:32.159 --> 00:09:36.720
No matter what ups and downs that you make experience,

00:09:36.759 --> 00:09:40.480
focus on the things Jehovah has given you

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:43.799
and stay the course like Leah did.

00:09:43.799 --> 00:09:48.039
She went from feeling like a mere stand-in

00:09:48.039 --> 00:09:52.440
to realizing that the ultimate substitute was in fact

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:57.440
who, Jehovah, who stepped in and absorbed all the pain

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.960
in her heart.

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:04.960
And just as Jehovah loved Leah, he loves each one of you too

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:10.879
and is always ready to step in as your substitute.
