00:00:10.699 --> 00:00:15.699
In October 2014, in the first episode of JW Broadcasting,

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:19.699
the organization released its first music video entitled

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:22.699
The Best Life Ever.

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:27.699
Almost five years later, we've benefited from over 40 additional

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:30.699
original songs that emphasize our spiritual goals,

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:33.700
and that number just keeps on growing.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.700
Since the translation of the broadcast began in May 2015,

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.700
new original songs have been simultaneously released

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.700
on a regular basis in more than 120 languages.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.700
Perhaps you play the songs on your way to work.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.700
Or maybe you keep them on the background while you do household chores.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.700
Regardless, these songs have brought much joy, comfort,

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:02.700
and spiritual encouragement to our brothers and sisters around the world.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.700
But how are they produced?

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.700
Join us behind the scenes to find out.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.700
The Teaching Committee is involved in every aspect of the development

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.700
of original songs, starting with the Scriptural Foundation,

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.700
as well as the emotional feel for the original songs.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.700
Knowing that music has the power to really motivate us,

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.700
they want to make sure that it reaches its intended purpose.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.700
So they give direction to the music team.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.700
The music team will review the approved song ideas,

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.700
and then assign those to composers who have been approved

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:37.700
from all over the world.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.700
In fact, sometimes we'll assign two composers to work on the same song.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.700
Perhaps there is someone working on the lyrics in England,

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.700
and somebody is working on the music or the melody in Brazil.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.700
You bring those two together, and you have a wonderful song

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.700
that attracts many people from various cultures.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.700
Once a musical concept is developed, a rough version is recorded

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.700
and sent to the Teaching Committee for review.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.700
After a prayerful consideration of these original songs,

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.699
they give direction to the music and story team,

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:12.699
regarding the lyrics, the music itself,

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:16.699
as well as the visual aspects, so that they can implement the direction given.

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:21.590
After receiving direction from the Teaching Committee,

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.590
the song is adjusted as needed, and a final recording is made.

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.590
Musicians will be used from many different places in the world,

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.590
including recording engineers from other branches.

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.590
Typically, we'll record the background music first,

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.590
and then we'll call in a singer to record the voices

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.590
with the background music.

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.590
And then an engineer will take those two elements

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.590
and mix them together to make the final product.

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.590
Once the song is recorded and mixed, then the files are made available

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.590
for the next step in production.

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.590
The story team receives a list of approved original songs

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.590
from the Teaching Committee of the governing body.

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.590
A visual concept is developed to accompany the original song

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.590
and its final form as a music video.

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.590
Then it will be assigned to one of our local production teams

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.590
or one of our 11 international video teams.

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:18.590
A story board artist is assigned to work closely with the assigned team

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.590
and specifically the video director.

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.590
The governing body has mentioned how much they love

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.590
to have an international flavor to our videos.

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.590
So when the story board artist is working very closely

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.590
with the director and the team,

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:39.590
they're able to accommodate local culture and scenery.

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.590
These visual ideas are then made into a rough version

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.590
of the music video called an animatic.

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:54.090
But once they review and approve in that animatic,

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.090
then we get approval and the team can go out and actually shoot

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.840
and produce the video.

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.840
Research is provided to ensure that any biblical

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.840
or modern-day scenes are accurately portrayed.

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:14.300
The video team films and edits the music video

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.300
before submitting it for review.

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:19.300
And after any required changes are made,

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:22.300
the Teaching Committee gives a final approval.

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.300
Something that's unique about our productions

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.300
is how many languages we produce the original songs in.

00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:44.819
Translating a song is very different than translating

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:46.819
an interview or a dramatization.

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:48.819
And when a person sings,

00:04:48.819 --> 00:04:50.819
some of the sounds are not actual words.

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:52.819
For example, in the original song

00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:54.819
with Jehovah We Are One,

00:04:54.819 --> 00:04:56.819
the background vocals repeat the sound,

00:04:56.819 --> 00:04:58.819
ah, yeah.

00:04:58.819 --> 00:05:04.269
And in Cantonese,

00:05:04.269 --> 00:05:07.269
this is actually a word that means grandpa.

00:05:07.269 --> 00:05:09.269
So that translation team obtained permission

00:05:09.269 --> 00:05:11.269
to change these vocals to another sound

00:05:11.269 --> 00:05:14.269
that would not cause confusion.

00:05:14.269 --> 00:05:19.470
We also prepare what are called lead sheets

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:22.470
or the lyrics with the musical notation

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:25.470
so you can learn to play the song yourself.

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:28.470
When a Teaching Committee receives comments

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:30.470
and letters from all over the world,

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:32.470
it really warms their hearts

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:34.470
knowing that these original songs

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:37.470
are really affecting people.

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:41.470
I listen to them when cooking or folding laundry.

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:46.620
We sing and dance during our family worship.

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:49.620
We really enjoy them every month.

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:54.300
My daughter has learned from a song

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.300
how she could show love

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:57.300
by writing letters

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:05.879
and showing hospitality to friends.

00:06:05.879 --> 00:06:07.879
I listen to them in the car

00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:08.879
on my way to work.

00:06:08.879 --> 00:06:10.879
And they make me happy

00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:12.879
and help me to enjoy my day.

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:16.420
These songs have really helped me.

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:18.420
Because when the people I work with

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:20.420
provoke or stumble with me,

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:23.420
or when my employer talks to me on kindle.

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:26.730
During my lunch break,

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:28.730
I go to the car

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:30.730
and I listen to the songs

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:32.730
and become calm,

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:33.730
regain happiness,

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:36.730
and enjoy the rest of the day.

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:40.730
These songs have been a real blessing to the Brotherhood.

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:43.730
We all look forward to receiving these original songs,

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:45.730
not as mere entertainment,

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:47.730
but as another opportunity

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:49.730
to build up our faith.

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:52.730
Help motivate us to focus on spiritual goals

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:54.730
and strengthen our determination

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:56.730
to be loyal to Jehovah.
