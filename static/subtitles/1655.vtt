00:00:01.899 --> 00:00:22.219
Jesus said at Luke 21-11 that the last days would be marked by food shortages in one place

00:00:22.219 --> 00:00:23.980
after another.

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.059
There's no question that we're seeing the fulfillment of that prophecy.

00:00:28.059 --> 00:00:33.939
In the last few years, droughts and floods, as well as epidemics, wars, and civil unrest

00:00:33.939 --> 00:00:40.500
have wiped out crops and cut off food supplies for millions of people, including many of our

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.539
fellow worshipers.

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:47.179
To see many of our brothers are farmers, and a good number of them grow crops as their

00:00:47.179 --> 00:00:48.820
primary food source.

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.179
When the crops fail, their families have nothing to eat.

00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:56.539
Of course, Jehovah knows what his people need.

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:00.939
And in this report, we'd like to share what Jehovah's organization is doing to support

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:05.459
our brothers and sisters who are facing severe food shortages.

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:10.099
The coordinators committee of the governing body began a project in 2022 to assess the

00:01:10.099 --> 00:01:12.620
needs of branches most at risk.

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:17.260
The governing body then approved a series of new relief initiatives that are already

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.459
helping our brothers get the food they need in times of crisis.

00:01:21.459 --> 00:01:27.260
These initiatives include first, assisting publishers to prepare personally for food

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:33.459
shortages, and second, authorizing branches to provide quality seed and even limited

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:37.859
farming supplies to those facing a food crisis.

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:42.700
Let's see what benefit these initiatives have had in three of the branches involved.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.540
Peru, Zambia, and Malawi.

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:54.780
First, let's see what's being done to help our brothers and sisters prepare personally.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:01.859
In rural areas, some brothers got some animals to raise, or planted vegetables in their gardens.

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:07.700
In the urban areas, the brothers made use of small spaces in their houses, like rooftops

00:02:07.739 --> 00:02:12.219
or even windows, where they planted vegetables and pots.

00:02:12.219 --> 00:02:14.500
Oh, I quickly did what was suggested.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.979
I bought potatoes, corn, wheat, salt, pasta, and other products.

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:23.860
And I was able to grow some vegetables in a little greenhouse that I made.

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.620
That really helped us a lot.

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:34.300
In the jungle, the publishers began to store non-perishable food, plant vegetables and fruits,

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.900
and raise animals for their own consumption.

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:42.939
Months later, a very violent protest started that blocked the only access road to the area,

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:48.740
making basic items extremely valuable and causing prices to skyrocket.

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:55.020
However, when the protests intensified even further, the brothers were already prepared

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:00.780
and had what they needed as well as enough to share with others.

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:06.580
Our family quickly organized, and we began planting bell peppers, cucumbers, tomatoes,

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.419
and bananas.

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:14.659
We also had to raise some animals like guinea pigs and ducks, so we'd have enough food

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:17.810
to sustain ourselves.

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.770
Additionally, we were able to share with our dear brothers in the congregation because

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:23.370
we had fuel.

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:29.990
We used the motorcycle to take food to our brothers.

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:35.550
Because of these efforts, some publishers have been able to sell crops, which helped

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:40.469
them to become or to remain self-sufficient.

00:03:40.469 --> 00:03:44.830
Due to drought and climate change in Malawi, brothers and sisters were encouraged to

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:47.629
vary what they grow and when.

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:52.949
Also, in order to maintain some income, we suggested that the brothers don't sell all the

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:58.750
crops at one time, but rather sell them gradually to help them throughout the year.

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:04.550
Initially, we were doubting the instructions from the organisation to plant different crops.

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:10.990
Because here in Malawi, we love maize, and if someone doesn't eat seema, they feel like

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:13.870
they haven't eaten at all.

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.389
But the organisation encouraged us to plant different crops.

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:19.550
That is because of climate change.

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:24.230
So we started growing different crops, like pumpkins and potatoes.

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:28.670
When we told our children they wouldn't be eating seema, but instead they would eat pumpkins,

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:32.750
it was difficult for them since they are used to eating seema.

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.350
And knowing we needed to change, helped our children to adjust to eating different kinds

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:41.699
of foods and being satisfied.

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:47.540
I really appreciate the suggestions from the organisation to try irrigation farming.

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:54.379
This kind of farming enables us to grow a variety of crops like beans, peas, tomatoes and green

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:58.060
beans, and we can do it throughout the year.

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:02.899
This has proved to be so helpful, because I'm a single parent.

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:08.019
Yet, I'm able to look after my children and my aged mother.

00:05:08.019 --> 00:05:11.740
On top of that, I've been able to regular pioneer.

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:18.500
And also from the farming proceeds, I'm able to pay for my medical and hospital bills.

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:22.779
These experiences remind us that things can change quickly.

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:28.699
Whether we live in a rural area or a city, our food supply can be cut off unexpectedly.

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:32.899
That's why we've been urged to have a reasonable reserve of food.

00:05:32.899 --> 00:05:39.660
Water, medicine and similar items encase it's necessary to shelter in place for an extended period of time.

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:44.100
Preparing in advance has been a protection for many of our brothers.

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:51.899
But in some parts of the world, such preparations just may not be enough, or may not even be possible.

00:05:51.899 --> 00:05:57.779
Natural disasters can wipe out a harvest and leave families with so little that they can't afford food

00:05:57.779 --> 00:06:01.300
or even the seed needed to plant for the next year.

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:06.579
In dire situations like this, our brothers need more than encouragement.

00:06:06.579 --> 00:06:11.180
Let's see how branches help publishers in need.

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:18.060
Some parts of our branch territory experienced severe drought, while others were hit with floods.

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:22.939
In both cases, it meant the loss of crops needed for survival.

00:06:22.939 --> 00:06:27.300
We received approval to provide food for the brother's immediate needs.

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:34.420
We were able to assist with quality seeds and basic farming supplies, like fertilizer and basic farming tools.

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:41.899
In addition, we provided helpful information for those who were able to raise livestock and grow some food all year round.

00:06:41.899 --> 00:06:49.060
The DRD works with the DRC's in the field to identify publishers who are adversely affected.

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:53.459
After that, approval is sought to provide relief.

00:06:54.459 --> 00:06:58.459
I received the provisions of fertilizer and seed.

00:06:58.459 --> 00:07:04.459
Well, when we harvested, I got 650 kg bags of mace.

00:07:04.459 --> 00:07:10.459
We had enough food, and we could go to the meetings and preaching. There was plenty.

00:07:10.459 --> 00:07:18.459
In 2023, in the year, we assisted 190 new brothers and sisters with gods to breed.

00:07:19.459 --> 00:07:25.459
We also provided emotional and spiritual support to the affected brothers.

00:07:25.459 --> 00:07:31.459
We were given three goats, one died, but another gave birth, and we were back to three.

00:07:31.459 --> 00:07:35.459
That goat is pregnant again, and we're expecting another soon.

00:07:35.459 --> 00:07:39.459
My wife and I felt very happy for the goats we received.

00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:45.459
We saw that Jehovah in the early part of his organization cares for his servants.

00:07:45.459 --> 00:07:56.459
Of course, we cannot end poverty. However, these opportunities to provide support reassure us and them of Jehovah's continued care.

00:07:56.459 --> 00:08:01.459
And when a disaster strikes, our response is always scalable.

00:08:01.459 --> 00:08:14.459
For example, when there is a small disaster, the needs of those affected can often be cared for by the immediate family members, the friends, the local congregation, or indeed the psychiatry.

00:08:15.459 --> 00:08:20.459
I learned to be generous to others who are in need.

00:08:20.459 --> 00:08:28.459
I also learned to make regular contributions so that others can also benefit from the support like we have benefited.

00:08:28.459 --> 00:08:38.740
I am so happy and appreciative of Jehovah using his organization to give us these practical suggestions.

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:50.740
As you saw, the supplies being delivered through this initiative ranged from quality seed, to basic farming tools, to in a few cases even goats.

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:59.740
Really, the point is to provide whatever these dear brothers and sisters need to survive and to regain the dignity of self-sufficiency.

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:04.740
This is in the spirit of Proverbs 3.27, which says,

00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:10.740
Do not withhold good from those to whom you should give it, if it is within your power to help.

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:15.740
At the same time, we need to have realistic expectations.

00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:22.740
Jesus said, You always have the poor with you, and those words are certainly proving to be true in this time of the end.

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:27.740
We humbly acknowledge that we can't end poverty, nor is that our goal.

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:34.740
And due to circumstances beyond their control, some of our hard-working brothers struggle to feed their families.

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:41.740
And it's our privilege as an organization to modestly do what we can to help them.

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:54.740
Second Corinthians 8.4 calls us work a relief ministry, and we deeply appreciate the hard work of all of you who are supporting this ministry through your loving labors and your generous donations.

00:09:54.740 --> 00:10:01.740
Of course, our primary ministry remains focused on preaching the good news of God's kingdom.

00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:06.740
Under that kingdom, everyone will enjoy an abundance of food.

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:13.740
Until then, we rejoice to see how Jehovah is sustaining our brothers and sisters during food shortages.
