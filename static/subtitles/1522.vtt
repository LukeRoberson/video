00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:10.650
During his mission retours, the Apostle Paul came to Corinth more than once.

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:17.649
On the first occasion, he stayed there for a year and six months, teaching the word of God.

00:00:17.649 --> 00:00:22.649
In Paul's day, Corinth was a relatively new city.

00:00:22.649 --> 00:00:29.649
The ancient Greek city had been destroyed by the Romans in 146 BCE.

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:36.649
About one hundred years later, Corinth was reestablished as a Roman colony by Julius Caesar

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:41.649
and soon became part of the province of Achaea.

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:49.649
By the time Paul arrived about 50 CE, Corinth had grown into a thriving commercial center.

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.649
The city's strategic location contributed to its growth and prosperity.

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.649
It was built at the western end of the Isthmus, or narrow strip of land,

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:06.219
that connects the Peloponnesian peninsula to the Greek mainland.

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:12.219
This made it possible for Corinth to control two nearby ports on both sides of the Isthmus,

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:16.219
Lacheum and Sanctuary.

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:41.879
So the city was a crossroads for merchants.

00:01:41.879 --> 00:01:46.879
People in Corinth were exposed to travelers and ideas from all over the Roman Empire.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:02:01.420
Paul would have been familiar with the city's Agara, or Marketplace.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.420
It was lined with colonnades and public buildings.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.419
Rose of shops sold all kinds of goods from the commonplace to the luxurious.

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:18.259
As tent makers, Paul, along with Aquila and Priscilla,

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:24.930
may have worked in one of the shops here or in another part of the city.

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.930
Residents of Corinth mingled in the Agara with travelers and merchants passing through,

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:37.419
making it an ideal location for Christians to preach.

00:02:37.419 --> 00:02:43.419
The Agara also had an elevated platform called the Bima, or Judgment Seed.

00:02:43.419 --> 00:02:49.419
From the Bima, magistrates addressed the city and announced Judgments.

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:54.419
This may have been where the Jews brought Paul before the Pro-Consul Galio.

00:02:54.419 --> 00:03:01.819
Religion played an important part in the life of those who lived in Corinth.

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:07.819
The road leading up to the aqua Corinth, the steep rocky hill that towered over the city,

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:10.819
was lined with temples.

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:14.819
Religious structures were also built around the Agara.

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:23.099
These were dedicated to various deities, such as Fortune, Apollo, and Aphrodite.

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:32.550
Not far from the Agara, a paving stone can today be seen with an inscription

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:36.550
referring to a government official named Arastus.

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:43.550
Paul included greetings from Arastus, the city treasurer, in a letter he wrote while in Corinth.

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:48.550
Possibly the same Arastus referred to in this inscription.

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:53.550
No visitor to Corinth could fail to notice the city's massive theater.

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:57.550
It could hold more than 15,000 people.

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:05.550
When Paul wrote to the Corinthian Christians that he and fellow apostles had become a theatrical spectacle to the world,

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:11.550
he may have been thinking about how exposed the stage was to the spectator's gaze.

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:17.550
Paul fulfilled his mission in Corinth, helping to establish a congregation there,

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:21.550
and possibly also in nearby Sanctuary.
