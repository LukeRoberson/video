00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:09.779
Growing up in the South, during the time of segregation,

00:00:09.779 --> 00:00:13.779
blacks and whites, we couldn't mix.

00:00:13.779 --> 00:00:16.780
And not only that, they had signs to keep you

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:18.780
knowing where you're supposed to go.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:23.780
I couldn't understand why we couldn't get along.

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:25.780
Good to see you.

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.780
Yes, sir?

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:29.780
Thank you, sir.

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:32.780
Grandma, he's just a boy. Why are you seeing, sir?

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.780
Be quiet. I want you to know your place.

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.780
I told her after we got back on the truck, you know what?

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.780
I'll never hold my head down, you know.

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.780
My grandmother, she knew I had a love for the body

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.780
because I would always read the Bible as a kid.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.219
But I couldn't understand it.

00:00:52.219 --> 00:01:00.780
I used to pray what makes us so different.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:09.719
You know, while we came together, I met a group.

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:13.719
And this group was like what I really wanted to be in.

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:17.719
It was about politics.

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:19.719
They said we fight injustice.

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:21.719
And when they said that we're injustice,

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:25.719
it was like, yeah, this is what I want to be in, right?

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:30.719
Be part of something that can change and make people unite it, right?

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:34.510
That was my goal.

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.510
We started protesting about police brutality.

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.510
And I think that's what a lot of people, you know,

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:43.510
was focusing on.

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.510
I liked some of the things that they was doing.

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:49.510
But they trained us every day in a military training,

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:52.510
learn how to use weapons and stuff like that.

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.510
And so I'm thinking like, this is not what I want to be in.

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:57.510
This is not what I join.

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.510
So I start like going back to God again,

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.510
to read the Bible because it's like, I'm not changing anything.

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.510
The Bible that I was reading was a team, James Version.

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:09.509
So I was reading it, reading it, reading it.

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.509
But I couldn't understand it.

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:13.509
We went to Jamaica.

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:16.509
And I saw this Bible, the New World translation.

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:17.509
And I started reading it.

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:19.509
And it made so much sense.

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:20.509
I could understand it.

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:22.509
And it wasn't the end of it.

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:24.509
I was like, wow.

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:26.509
You know, like, this is the one I want to get.

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:30.509
One day two women knocked on the door.

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:32.509
I didn't know David's Jehovah's Witness.

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:34.509
All I could see was a Bible.

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:37.509
And I said, what did you get the Bible from?

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:39.509
And they said, okay, we'll bring you up.

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:40.509
Bring you up.

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:41.509
And they did.

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:42.509
So they brought me the Bible.

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:44.509
But I didn't know I was going to have a Bible study

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:46.509
come along with it.

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:49.509
The first time I went to a convention

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:50.509
was Jehovah's Witness.

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:53.509
It was like 10,000 people.

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:56.509
When I go in it, and I see all these different faces

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:59.509
and different colors, it's like Jehovah showing me,

00:02:59.509 --> 00:03:01.509
like, hey, Raphika.

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:04.509
Remember you asked me about all different people getting together

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:08.509
and being one, see, I'm not partial.

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:09.509
I still get along.

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:10.509
We are unified.

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:14.509
And it just made me feel so good inside.

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:19.509
Yes, this is the organization that I want to be in.

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:23.509
I just see people as people, you know.

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:28.509
And I can be friends with anybody.

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:31.509
Now that I know what the Bible really teaches,

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:33.509
I have a wonderful life.

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:37.509
Because I know that I'm the only God in His government

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:40.509
that can bring about peace.

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:42.509
Just like I Joe would unify everybody,

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:46.509
all like everybody to be unified and come to know Jehovah.

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:48.509
Just like I know Him.

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:51.509
Jehovah asked my prayer.
