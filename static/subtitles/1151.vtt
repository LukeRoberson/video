00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:07.019
Our well-designed body is indeed a reason for us to rejoice.

00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:10.820
Certain body parts help us to perceive the world around us.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.820
For example, please turn with me to Proverbs 20 verse 12.

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.579
Let us see what the Scriptures say in connection with two sensory organs.

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:25.379
Here in Proverbs 20 verse 12 we read,

00:00:25.379 --> 00:00:30.620
The hearing ear and the seeing eye Jehovah has made both of them.

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.619
Yes, our ability to hear and see is from Jehovah.

00:00:35.619 --> 00:00:39.060
How grateful we are that he has given us the senses.

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.820
They allow us to enjoy life more fully.

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.899
The hear, for example, allows us to hear delightful sounds.

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:51.899
How does it make you feel when you hear birds chirping

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.340
or the relaxing sound of a babbling brook?

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.219
And how we cherish hearing the voice of a loved one.

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.299
Maybe you're made, your father or mother, or your child.

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:06.980
We also enjoy beautiful music.

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.620
Even those who cannot hear can enjoy music.

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:16.540
Some connect with the song's bass notes or its beat rather than its melody.

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:34.780
In the following video, note how Jehovah created us to enjoy a wide variety of sounds.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:48.700
Our world is full of sounds.

00:01:48.739 --> 00:01:55.560
Some are natural.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.549
Others we create.

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:04.870
We can hear music before we're born

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:10.229
and can develop the love of music as we grow.

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.629
We can compose music,

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:16.229
be moved by it,

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:19.710
and replay it in our minds.

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:23.750
Musical instruments typically combine a sound generator

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.509
which produces tones with a resonator,

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:30.789
such as wood or metal, which adds volume.

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:36.020
The design resembles our own vocal organs.

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:42.939
But few instruments compare to the beauty of the human voice.

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:48.400
Our hearing complements the voice.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:54.090
We can listen to things that draw us closer to God

00:02:54.090 --> 00:03:00.169
and use the voice he gave us to praise him with joy.

00:03:00.169 --> 00:03:04.129
Praise John for Jehovah is good.

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:15.889
Sing praises to his name for it is pleasant.

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:18.889
Yes, sounds definitely enrich our life.

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:21.810
They make our life more enjoyable.

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.210
Does this not instill in us the desire to praise Jehovah?

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:30.610
Now let us please open to Isaiah chapter 30 verse 21.

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:36.849
Here we see that ears and hearing are sometimes used in the figurative way in the Bible.

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:40.610
Isaiah 30 verse 21 reads,

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:44.169
and your own ears will hear word behind you saying,

00:03:44.169 --> 00:03:46.610
this is the way, walk in it,

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:48.289
in case you should go to the right

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:51.530
or in case you should go to the left.

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.169
We can hear Jehovah's figurative voice from his word the Bible

00:03:56.169 --> 00:04:00.090
and from his guidance through the Holy Spirit and the congregation.

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:06.689
Jehovah's guidance is so clear it is as if we could hear him speaking to us.

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:08.969
Let me ask you a question.

00:04:08.969 --> 00:04:12.729
Does the sound of Jehovah's voice make you enjoy life?

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:15.449
Does it make you rejoice?

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:19.009
I suppose we would all answer with a clear yes.

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:22.930
Jehovah's voice is a delightful sound.

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:27.529
We all know how good it feels when we apply Jehovah's guidance

00:04:27.529 --> 00:04:31.170
and enjoy success in life.

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:34.449
Let's think again about our literal ears.

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:37.850
They are very sensitive, so we need to protect them.

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:42.329
Certain sounds, noise, can even damage them.

00:04:42.329 --> 00:04:50.529
So to protect our hearing, you might use acoustic earmarks to block out harmful noise.

00:04:50.529 --> 00:04:53.569
By what about our figurative ears?

00:04:53.569 --> 00:04:55.889
Do we need to protect them too?

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:59.089
Are there sounds out there that can harm us?

00:04:59.089 --> 00:05:00.610
Yes, there are.

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:07.490
The reality is we live in a world full of damaging and unpleasant noise.

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:11.569
So then, how can we protect ourselves?

00:05:11.569 --> 00:05:14.889
Here are three measures we need to take.

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:20.089
First, block out the harmful noise around us.

00:05:20.089 --> 00:05:24.170
We can put on noise-canceling headphones.

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:30.089
In other words, we refuse to listen to anything that can distance us from Jehovah.

00:05:30.089 --> 00:05:32.050
Like what?

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:36.769
Deceptive reasoning and false accusations, for example, are very dangerous.

00:05:36.769 --> 00:05:40.889
They undermine our trust in Jehovah's organization.

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:46.050
Some who were once part of the Christian congregation now attempt to mislead us.

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:52.089
They spread half-truths and outright lies about Jehovah's organization.

00:05:52.089 --> 00:05:57.970
Harmful sounds might also come from non-Christian workmates, schoolmates,

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:00.810
or contacts on social media.

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:03.170
They do not share our beliefs.

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:07.129
So conversations with them are rarely faith-strengthening.

00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:13.529
They might weaken our faith, making our Christian life course more difficult.

00:06:13.529 --> 00:06:22.050
Therefore, we need to protect our ears from damaging noise by not listening to it.

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:27.759
What is the second way to protect ourselves from damaging sounds?

00:06:27.759 --> 00:06:31.600
Headphones can help us block out the noise around us

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:37.079
and replace it with something delightful, maybe a favorite song.

00:06:37.079 --> 00:06:43.639
So put on our figurative headphones and listen to hold some things.

00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:49.199
Our favorite sounds, delightful sounds from Jehovah.

00:06:49.199 --> 00:06:52.120
This is what we hear at our Christian meetings.

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:55.680
And when we sing at our Christian meetings like we've seen in the video,

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:59.519
our sounds praise Jehovah.

00:06:59.519 --> 00:07:03.720
What we read in our publications, what we see in our website,

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:07.920
what we hear in our building conversations with our brothers and sisters,

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:14.779
all of these beautiful sounds protect our ears.

00:07:14.779 --> 00:07:20.180
A third aid for protecting our ears is Jehovah's help.

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:24.060
Sometimes we might not feel like putting on our headphones.

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:29.660
We might argue it is so much more comfortable without them.

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:33.379
The damage to my ears will not be that serious.

00:07:33.379 --> 00:07:37.500
Now this is where Jehovah comes into play.

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:42.980
He will help us listen to his voice whenever we ask him for his help in prayer.

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:47.100
He will motivate us to put on our headphones, so to speak.

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:51.899
He gives us the inner strength to stop listening to sounds that might be tempting

00:07:51.899 --> 00:07:55.500
and yet are so dangerous.

00:07:55.500 --> 00:08:01.459
So what are the three ways to protect our figurative ears?

00:08:01.459 --> 00:08:04.779
We stop listening to damaging sounds.

00:08:04.779 --> 00:08:11.300
We listen to hold some things and we pray for Jehovah's help.

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:18.420
Dear brothers and sisters, Jehovah created sounds because he wants us to enjoy life.

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:22.579
Please let us continue to make wise use of our hearing.

00:08:22.579 --> 00:08:30.139
And then we will rejoice in hearing delightful sounds forever.

00:08:30.139 --> 00:08:33.860
Brother John Ackron, helper to the coordinators committee,

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:37.340
will now present the last talk of this symposium.

00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:43.779
Creation proves that Jehovah wants us to rejoice, fascinating animals.
