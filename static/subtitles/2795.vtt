00:00:01.139 --> 00:00:06.540
When you're reading the Bible, try to get the whole picture.

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.240
Now, we'll use a couple of well-known Bible accounts

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.240
to illustrate.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.739
Have you been raised in a step family or a blended family?

00:00:17.739 --> 00:00:21.140
If you have, did you know that you have something in common

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.039
with Joseph, the son of Jacob?

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:27.739
Joseph was raised with 10 half-brothers

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:31.239
in a large blended family.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:37.039
So, now you want to try to view this family as a composite.

00:00:37.039 --> 00:00:40.340
You want to try to figure out how did people mesh

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.939
or how did they clash within this family?

00:00:43.939 --> 00:00:45.340
What would you do?

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.840
Well, you might start by writing down some of the characteristics

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.340
of the individual members of the family.

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.640
What about Joseph's half-brothers and Joseph himself?

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.340
What do you know about them?

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.140
What about Judah?

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.640
Simeon.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.840
Levi.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:01.439
Dan.

00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:02.439
Nathalie.

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:04.340
What do you know?

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:06.040
So write down their characteristics

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.540
and try to figure out how they might get along.

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.040
Sometimes there is one individual incident

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.340
that's recorded in the Bible.

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.239
But we mustn't forget.

00:01:17.239 --> 00:01:21.739
People's actions have a way of affecting other people.

00:01:21.739 --> 00:01:24.540
So when you read about a certain incident in the Bible,

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.340
try to imagine who might have been affected

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.340
by that incident.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.840
Take an example.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.340
In the book of Genesis,

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:38.340
we read that Jacob's son Ruben committed sexual immorality

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.739
with Bilha.

00:01:40.739 --> 00:01:44.340
Well, that had an effect on other people without doubt.

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.739
Who was Ruben?

00:01:45.739 --> 00:01:49.040
He was Leah's oldest son.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.939
Who was Bilha, Rachel's handmaiden.

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:55.340
Do you think that there might have been a little animosity

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.840
or tension between Leah and Rachel sometimes,

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.840
especially when you consider how their marriage

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.840
has started out?

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.040
There may have been.

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.340
And it may be that the attitudes of the women

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.039
had some bearing on the attitudes of their sons as well.

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:16.340
So you take all of these things into consideration.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.639
Now Bilha had two sons, Dan and Nathalie.

00:02:20.639 --> 00:02:22.740
How do you think they felt when they learned

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.139
that their oldest brother or half brother

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:29.139
had committed fornication with their mother?

00:02:29.139 --> 00:02:31.240
So there could have been tension there.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.340
And this all goes into the mix

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.340
when we're considering the family as a composite.

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.039
Now, do you picture Joseph at age 17

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:45.439
with 10 much older half brothers,

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:46.939
maybe in their 30s?

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:50.139
Some old enough to be his father?

00:02:50.139 --> 00:02:52.039
Not true.

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:55.939
The truth is that there was only a seven-year age difference

00:02:55.939 --> 00:02:58.740
between Joseph's oldest brother, Ruben,

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.939
and Joseph himself.

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:06.240
In fact, 11 of Jacob's sons were born during the seven-year period

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.840
when Jacob was working for Laben.

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.840
11 sons in seven years?

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.840
How is that possible?

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:15.840
Easy.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.340
When you remember that Jacob had two wives

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.340
and two concubines or secondary wives.

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.139
So they didn't have to be a nine-month interval

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:27.439
between the birth of the children.

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:31.039
In fact, some could have been born just about at the same time.

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:34.139
They could have been the same age.

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:38.340
So when Joseph was sold into slavery at age 17,

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.340
his oldest brother was no more than 24.

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.539
Some of his brothers were only a year or two

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:47.039
older than Joseph himself.

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:49.439
So we're talking about a group of young men

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:52.039
in their late teens and early 20s.

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:55.840
And this might explain some of the hot-headed reactions

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.439
that some of those young men had.

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:01.539
Well, so much for the boys.

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:03.939
What about their father, Jacob?

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:05.740
What can we learn about him?

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:07.240
A lot.

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.340
For one thing, he was a spiritual man.

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.840
And this is something for you young brothers and sisters

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.939
who were contemplating marriage to think about.

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:18.639
Jacob was willing to go to any length

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:22.639
to keep his relationship with Jehovah intact.

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:24.139
Let's take an example.

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:28.439
Genesis chapter 29 and verse 18.

00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:32.839
You can follow along on the screen as I read this.

00:04:32.839 --> 00:04:35.939
And we're talking about marriage here.

00:04:35.939 --> 00:04:38.540
Genesis 29, 18, it says,

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.339
Jacob had fallen in love with Rachel.

00:04:41.339 --> 00:04:46.439
So he said, I am willing to serve you seven years

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:50.139
for your younger daughter, Rachel.

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:52.339
Now, what's the takeaway?

00:04:52.339 --> 00:04:55.639
Jacob didn't marry the first person who came along.

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:57.139
Maybe some pagan woman.

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:00.139
He didn't say, well, seven years is too long to wait.

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:03.540
I'm going to find some Philistine woman, not marry her.

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:06.839
He was willing to wait so that he could marry someone

00:05:06.839 --> 00:05:10.439
who would join him in the worship of Jehovah.

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:13.639
And you young folks, if you are willing to wait,

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:16.240
you can be sure that you will have Jehovah's blessing

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.639
as well.

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:21.339
Now, Jacob was apparently also a bit of a romantic.

00:05:21.339 --> 00:05:23.639
Notice verse 20.

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:27.439
It says, and Jacob served seven years for Rachel.

00:05:27.439 --> 00:05:29.040
But notice this.

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:33.139
But in his eyes, they were like just a few days

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:35.939
because of his love for her.

00:05:35.939 --> 00:05:38.639
Isn't that poetic?

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:41.939
Jacob may have learned to treasure his wife

00:05:41.939 --> 00:05:45.040
by observing his parents, Isaac and Rebecca.

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:47.240
It appears that they had a strong marriage.

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:54.839
I just noticed what we read at Genesis 26 and verse 8.

00:05:54.839 --> 00:05:59.839
Genesis 26 and verse 8.

00:05:59.839 --> 00:06:02.240
It says, after some time had passed,

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:06.639
a Bimolec king of the Philistines was looking out of the window

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:10.240
and he saw Isaac, that's Jacob's father,

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:15.339
displaying affection for Rebecca his wife.

00:06:15.339 --> 00:06:18.339
So it appears that Isaac and Rebecca

00:06:18.339 --> 00:06:22.240
had a warm relationship, a good marriage.

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:26.639
Now, what else can we learn about Jacob?

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:30.339
There's an interesting detail recorded in chapter 25

00:06:30.339 --> 00:06:32.040
and verse 27.

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:35.839
It says, as the boys got bigger,

00:06:35.939 --> 00:06:40.040
Isaac, Jacob's brother, became a skilled hunter,

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:41.939
a man in the field,

00:06:41.939 --> 00:06:46.939
but Jacob was a blameless man dwelling in tents.

00:06:48.139 --> 00:06:51.439
So Jacob liked to dwell in tents.

00:06:52.639 --> 00:06:55.839
That might explain the strong bond that developed

00:06:55.839 --> 00:06:58.040
between Jacob and Joseph,

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:00.339
who was his youngest for many years.

00:07:01.839 --> 00:07:04.839
Now, although Jacob liked to dwell in tents,

00:07:04.839 --> 00:07:07.240
he was by no means a sissy.

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:09.439
He was a strong man,

00:07:09.439 --> 00:07:12.240
but he was a spiritual man.

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:15.540
That's something for your young brothers to take away.

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:17.939
You want to be strong, we know you do,

00:07:17.939 --> 00:07:20.740
but spirituality should come first.

00:07:22.439 --> 00:07:27.439
One time, spiritual Jacob gave his sons a beautiful lesson

00:07:27.439 --> 00:07:31.139
on how to settle a difference with a family member.

00:07:31.139 --> 00:07:34.339
We read about it at Genesis chapter 32

00:07:34.339 --> 00:07:37.339
and I think all of us can learn from his example.

00:07:38.939 --> 00:07:40.639
We learned at Genesis 32

00:07:40.639 --> 00:07:44.939
that Jacob's brother Esau was coming to see him.

00:07:44.939 --> 00:07:48.139
Now, they hadn't seen each other for 20 years

00:07:48.139 --> 00:07:50.740
and to say that their parting had been difficult

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:52.439
is an understatement.

00:07:52.439 --> 00:07:57.040
The fact is that when they separated more than 20 years earlier,

00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:01.540
Esau had vowed that one day he was going to kill his brother.

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:03.339
Now, he was coming to see him.

00:08:04.339 --> 00:08:07.740
Now, why was he so angry with Jacob?

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:12.639
It's because Jacob had received a blessing from their father

00:08:12.639 --> 00:08:16.139
and Esau was not happy.

00:08:16.139 --> 00:08:21.139
So Esau arrives and 400 men are with him.

00:08:21.139 --> 00:08:23.339
Why 400 men?

00:08:23.339 --> 00:08:25.139
Well, the Bible doesn't say,

00:08:25.139 --> 00:08:28.139
but it could be that he was trying to show how important

00:08:28.139 --> 00:08:31.439
and prominent he had become.

00:08:31.439 --> 00:08:33.940
How did Jacob react?

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:36.539
Did he try to go tit for tat?

00:08:36.539 --> 00:08:40.340
Did he try to show how important and prominent he had become

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:43.340
with all of the blessings he'd received?

00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:46.940
Did he reopen old wounds?

00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:49.440
Did he argue with his brother?

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:52.240
Did he say, you know, I was right all along

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:55.340
and you Esau, you have been wrong?

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:58.340
Did he demand an apology?

00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:00.139
No.

00:09:00.139 --> 00:09:02.840
There was a lot that Jacob could have bragged about.

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:04.240
No question about that.

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:07.340
There was no doubt that Jacob had Jehovah's blessing.

00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:11.940
Early on, we read that an angel of Jehovah had appeared to him

00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:16.740
and said, I am Jehovah, the God of Abraham, your father

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:20.840
and the God of Isaac, the land on which you are lying,

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:24.840
to you I am going to give it and to your offspring.

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:30.240
I am with you and I will safeguard you wherever you go.

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:33.639
I will not leave you.

00:09:33.639 --> 00:09:35.639
Well, that's quite a blessing, isn't it?

00:09:35.639 --> 00:09:37.340
But there's more.

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:39.639
For a portion of the previous night,

00:09:39.639 --> 00:09:43.639
that is, the night before Esau and Jacob met up,

00:09:43.639 --> 00:09:48.039
Jacob had wrestled with an angel and as a result,

00:09:48.039 --> 00:09:52.440
he had managed to receive another blessing.

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:56.039
But Jacob didn't flaunt his blessings.

00:09:56.039 --> 00:09:59.039
Instead, he humbled himself.

00:09:59.039 --> 00:10:03.139
In fact, he even bowed down seven times before his brother

00:10:03.139 --> 00:10:08.340
in front of his wives and his 11 sons.

00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:12.340
So Jacob settled any lingering difference with Esau,

00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:16.139
not with his fists, not with a bragging tongue,

00:10:16.139 --> 00:10:19.340
not with a weapon, but humbly,

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:23.840
like a real man, like a real spiritual man.
