00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:18.739
In the Bible book of Job, Jehovah described examples of his power observable in the natural world.

00:00:18.739 --> 00:00:25.039
Considered just a few, thunderhead clouds.

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:35.920
It is estimated that a single thunderstorm can release more energy than a 20 kiloton nuclear explosion.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:44.240
We see some of that energy as lightning.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.240
But lightning is only half the show.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:54.240
Thunder is produced when lightning heats up the surrounding air.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:59.240
The super-heated air rapidly expands causing a tremendous boom and crackling.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:08.819
This is followed by rumbles as the air continues to vibrate.

00:01:08.819 --> 00:01:14.819
Although usually associated with destructive power, lightning strikes can be very beneficial,

00:01:14.819 --> 00:01:19.680
as lightning rips through the air.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:29.859
Nitrogen is converted to a form that nourishes plants, who made a path for the thunderous storm cloud.

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:32.859
Can you send out lightning bolts?

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:35.859
Will they come and say to you, here we are?

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:51.760
Waves can start far out in the open sea.

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:57.459
They can begin as tiny ripples formed by the wind.

00:01:57.459 --> 00:02:02.459
As the wind continues to add energy, the waves increase in size.

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:07.459
The stronger the wind and longer the gust, the bigger the wave.

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:12.460
Hurricane winds can produce waves of 100 feet or more in height.

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:35.580
Long after the wind stops, the tremendous wave energy continues to move.

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.580
It can travel great distances from where it originated.

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:49.110
The amount of energy contained in all the oceans could theoretically power the entire globe without air pollution.

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:58.370
Who barricaded the sea behind doors when it burst out from the womb?

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:03.370
When I established my limit for it and put its bars and doors in place?

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.370
And I said, you may come this far or no farther.

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:15.099
Here is where your proud waves will stop.

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:23.819
The evening sky, Job could see familiar constellations.

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:26.819
What controls the motion of the stars?

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:34.539
Only thousands of years later did scientists learn more about these invisible laws.

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:42.550
Today we understand that the motion of stars is controlled by gravity.

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:48.550
Although they are in motion, we perceive their positions as fixed because they are so far away.

00:03:48.550 --> 00:04:00.060
Thus, they can serve as reliable navigational markers down to this day.

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.060
Yet despite increasing knowledge about the force of gravity,

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:10.060
humans are still unable to give a complete answer to the questions God posed to Job.

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:15.490
Do you know the laws governing the heavens?

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:24.189
Or can you impose their authority on the earth, round us?

00:04:24.189 --> 00:04:46.699
Daily reminders of Jehovah's great power can be seen.

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:48.699
What do you see?
