WEBVTT

00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:05.969
Welcome, brothers and sisters.

00:00:05.969 --> 00:00:10.810
Since our last report, we've had seven more special conventions.

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:14.210
They were held in Philadelphia, United States,

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:22.129
Sofia, Bulgaria, Suva Fiji, Lyon, France,

00:00:22.129 --> 00:00:27.370
Assoncion Paraguay, Tampa, United States,

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:30.809
Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.

00:00:30.809 --> 00:00:35.890
More than 16,000 delegates traveled from 101 countries

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.850
to attend these conventions.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.170
There was a combined peak attendance of over 98,000,

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.329
and 859 were baptized.

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:52.770
In Paraguay, there are currently about 11,500 publishers.

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.090
Nearly 2,000 delegates were invited to attend the special

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:57.649
convention.

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:03.929
Remarkably, though, the peak attendance was 28,617.

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:07.689
Clearly, there's much potential for growth.

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:13.129
In fact, 293 were baptized at this convention alone.

00:01:13.129 --> 00:01:16.609
That's the largest baptism at one location in the history

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:19.489
of our work in Paraguay.

00:01:19.489 --> 00:01:23.609
Jehovah has truly blessed these special conventions.

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:27.250
Two more remained for 2024, and we look forward

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:33.799
to 19 special conventions for the 2025 series.

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:36.719
Here's a brief legal update.

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:41.000
On September 17, 2024, the 17 judges

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.840
of the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.000
rolled in favor of sister Pindomudia,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.280
who was given blood transfusions in Spain

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.959
against her wishes.

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:57.159
Despite our sister's clear oral and written refusal,

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:01.879
a judge in Spain allowed doctors to proceed.

00:02:01.879 --> 00:02:06.319
The Grand Chamber concluded that this violated her rights.

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:09.280
It confirmed that patients have the fundamental right

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.319
to choose their own medical care.

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.479
What makes this decision especially significant

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:18.840
is that it was issued by the Grand Chamber

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.960
of the European Court of Human Rights.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.240
The Grand Chamber issues decisions only

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.080
when a case is considered to be groundbreaking.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.520
Thus, this decision obligates 46 countries in Europe

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.439
to respect patients' health care choices.

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:39.800
We're grateful to the Grand Chamber for this decision.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.360
Above all, we thank Jehovah for this legal victory,

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.159
which will benefit all of our brothers

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:51.759
and sisters in Europe as they make informed medical decisions.

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:55.439
This significant ruling reminds us how vital it is

00:02:55.439 --> 00:02:59.120
to discuss our personal medical choices with our doctor

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.400
and to put these choices in writing just

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.159
as our faithful sister did.

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:07.560
During this month, September, 2024,

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.080
we've all been involved in a global campaign

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.879
to start Bible studies using the enjoy life forever brochure.

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:18.520
What a joy to be united with our brothers and sisters

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.919
worldwide in this campaign.

00:03:21.919 --> 00:03:25.000
Not a couple of experiences.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.120
Ana Lore is an 84-year-old pioneer sister in Austria.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.639
Because of her health, she can't preach from door to door

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:35.360
for long periods of time.

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.120
However, she decided to offer a Bible course

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.159
to people who had responded positively

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:43.000
to our visits before.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.759
She thought of six people and visited them.

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:48.479
She was very happy to demonstrate the Bible course

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:50.520
with all six people.

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:54.599
The result, all six agreed to continue the course

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:57.840
in the coming days.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.120
In the Philippines, while witnessing from house to house,

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.680
two publishers approached a woman named Josie

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.800
who was doing laundry in front of her apartment.

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.039
Since Josie was busy, she told the publishers to talk instead

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:13.080
to her adult son and nephew who were inside.

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.319
Using the direct approach, the publishers started a Bible study

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:20.839
right away with both the son and the nephew.

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:23.879
As the Bible study was being demonstrated,

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:27.399
Josie's niece also joined in the discussion,

00:04:27.399 --> 00:04:29.360
and the publishers offered her a Bible study

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.079
which she readily accepted.

00:04:32.079 --> 00:04:35.160
Now with three persons involved in the initial Bible study

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.639
session, Josie became more curious and also

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:41.879
wanted to join in the conversation.

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:45.000
Josie too accepted a Bible study.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.800
However, before the two publishers

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.480
ended the initial study session, a fifth family member.

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:55.879
Josie's daughter was moved to ask what they were discussing.

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:58.360
Taking advantage of yet another opportunity,

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.639
the publishers offered her a Bible study

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:02.639
which she immediately accepted.

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:06.480
In all, five family members from one household

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.720
accepted the offer to have a Bible study

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.800
using the direct approach.

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.759
Clearly, Jehovah has blessed our efforts

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:19.480
to offer Bible studies during the campaign.

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:23.720
But we want to continue to focus on starting Bible studies.

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.600
Brothers and sisters, don't lose the momentum of this campaign.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.680
Ride the wave of enthusiasm.

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:35.120
Continue to offer Bible studies at every appropriate opportunity.

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.360
What can help us to do so?

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.839
Although public witnessing is an important aspect

00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:44.720
of our ministry and Bible studies sometimes result,

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:49.680
we encourage all to share regularly in the house to house work.

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.279
And remember, we'll have better results if we call it times

00:05:52.279 --> 00:05:55.439
when people are more likely to be home.

00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:59.480
This gives us more opportunities to start conversations

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:02.800
that lead to Bible studies.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:06.800
Why not try the direct approach when it seems appropriate?

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.199
While sharing in the ministry one evening,

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:13.680
a brother in Germany spoke with a man who's about 35 years old.

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:19.319
The brother asked him, when did you last read the Bible?

00:06:19.319 --> 00:06:23.040
The man replied, this morning.

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:25.600
They talked about why the Bible is valuable,

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:29.360
using Micah 4, 3, and 4 as an example.

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:33.680
Then they discussed lesson one of the enjoy life forever brochure.

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:38.360
The man's children were present and read the Bible versus allowed.

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:42.000
The man agreed to start the Bible course.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.560
In addition, many have started studies by witnessing informally

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:50.600
to relatives, neighbors, co-workers, shopkeepers, and so forth.

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:52.720
In Tanzania, a sister named Elizabeth

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:57.439
started four new studies during the first days of the campaign.

00:06:57.439 --> 00:06:59.439
One was with a woman who had a small cafe

00:06:59.439 --> 00:07:02.240
across the street from the kingdom hall.

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:05.240
Elizabeth frequently stopped in her shop for tea

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.360
or to purchase small items.

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:11.920
And she decided to offer her a study using the direct approach.

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:14.519
They watched the video, welcome to your Bible study,

00:07:14.519 --> 00:07:16.759
and the woman was delighted.

00:07:16.759 --> 00:07:20.279
She said, we should start right now.

00:07:20.279 --> 00:07:22.360
She also included her daughter and her niece

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:24.959
in the demonstration of the study.

00:07:24.959 --> 00:07:27.360
Elizabeth was very pleased that she also

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:30.920
attended a congregation meeting.

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:32.600
When asked what she thought of the meeting,

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:37.319
the woman said, that's what I love about Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:39.959
They study the Bible.

00:07:39.959 --> 00:07:43.199
When I go to other churches, they just sing and preach,

00:07:43.199 --> 00:07:45.360
but don't study the Bible.

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:47.199
I really loved it.

00:07:47.199 --> 00:07:49.839
I will try to come regularly.

00:07:49.839 --> 00:07:53.839
We're happy to hear these positive experiences.

00:07:53.839 --> 00:07:56.800
Our time in the ministry is valuable,

00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:00.040
and we want to use it wisely.

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:02.759
As 1 Corinthians 9 verse 26 says,

00:08:02.759 --> 00:08:06.160
therefore, the way I am running is not aimlessly.

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:11.199
The way I am aiming my blows is so as not to be striking the air.

00:08:11.199 --> 00:08:15.839
We love to give Jehovah our best.

00:08:15.839 --> 00:08:18.240
In addition to having a regular share in the house,

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:22.329
the housework, what else can help us?

00:08:22.329 --> 00:08:27.009
In some areas, publishers have many return visits.

00:08:27.009 --> 00:08:29.529
But perhaps we need to consider prayerfully

00:08:29.529 --> 00:08:33.370
if our return visits are productive.

00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:37.610
Are such individuals growing in their love of the truth?

00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:41.210
Do they truly appreciate our visits?

00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:44.450
Are they interested in a Bible study?

00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:48.769
If not, perhaps we're striking the air.

00:08:48.769 --> 00:08:51.850
It might be best to redirect our efforts.

00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:54.169
Those individuals will have another opportunity

00:08:54.169 --> 00:08:57.970
to hear the good news when the territories work again.

00:08:58.009 --> 00:09:03.690
Of course, balance, patience, and discernment are needed.

00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:08.769
But we want to be sure we're making the best use of our time.

00:09:08.769 --> 00:09:10.409
Similarly, we might ask ourselves,

00:09:10.409 --> 00:09:15.370
are my Bible students making progress?

00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:21.730
Preferably consider, are they accepting Bible truths?

00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:24.049
Are they beginning to apply what they learn

00:09:24.049 --> 00:09:27.129
and to make changes where needed?

00:09:27.129 --> 00:09:30.649
Have they begun to attend congregation meetings?

00:09:30.649 --> 00:09:34.490
Are they speaking with others about what they learn?

00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:36.610
If they're not progressing, it would be best

00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:38.690
to spend our time and energy seeking out

00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:43.490
those who are rightly disposed for everlasting life.

00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:45.769
So brothers and sisters, let's continue

00:09:45.769 --> 00:09:50.929
to offer Bible studies at every opportunity.

00:09:50.929 --> 00:09:52.929
In many places around the world, we're

00:09:52.929 --> 00:09:58.409
seeing an increase of Bible studies and tremendous growth.

00:09:58.409 --> 00:10:00.970
For example, at a recent convention in Madagascar,

00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:08.889
with over 21,000 in attendance, 419 were baptized.

00:10:08.889 --> 00:10:12.690
Also, the Philippines reports that during the 2024 service

00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:16.649
here, they had 5% growth.

00:10:16.649 --> 00:10:18.850
What's been the result?

00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:22.490
For the first time, they reported more than 260,000

00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:24.090
publishers.

00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:27.970
The number of studies has grown to over 252,000

00:10:27.970 --> 00:10:33.490
and 12,201 were baptized during the service here.

00:10:33.490 --> 00:10:37.370
120 new congregations, 15 new circuits were formed.

00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:40.250
Amazing.

00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:44.129
Wherever you may live, we think of Jesus' words

00:10:44.129 --> 00:10:48.419
at John 4, verse 35.

00:10:48.419 --> 00:10:51.220
Lift up your eyes and view the fields

00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:54.700
that they are white for harvesting.

00:10:54.700 --> 00:11:00.740
Also, Jesus said to his disciples at Matthew 9, verses 37 and 38,

00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:06.980
yes, the harvest is great, but the workers are few.

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:10.059
Therefore, big the master of the harvest

00:11:10.059 --> 00:11:13.419
to send out workers into his harvest.

00:11:13.419 --> 00:11:16.379
The fields are certainly white for harvesting

00:11:16.379 --> 00:11:19.379
in many places around the world.

00:11:19.379 --> 00:11:22.059
Of course, that raises the question,

00:11:22.059 --> 00:11:25.659
how can we individually expand our share in the preaching

00:11:25.659 --> 00:11:27.940
and teaching work?

00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:32.259
Clearly, we each have different circumstances.

00:11:32.259 --> 00:11:33.980
But could you look for opportunities

00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:37.940
to serve as an auxiliary pioneer?

00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:41.500
Could you reach out and become a regular pioneer?

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:43.220
If you're already pioneering, could you

00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:45.620
serve where there's a greater need, perhaps even

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:48.580
in another land?

00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:51.820
Have you considered applying to attend the school

00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:54.860
for kingdom evangelizers?

00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:56.419
Some graduates of that school are

00:11:56.419 --> 00:11:58.860
used as temporary special pioneers,

00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:03.580
special pioneers, circuit overseers, and missionaries.

00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:05.740
Truly, there are so many opportunities

00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:08.220
to reach out in Jehovah's service

00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:12.379
according to our own individual circumstances.

00:12:12.379 --> 00:12:14.700
The book organized to do Jehovah's will, Chapter 10,

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:19.179
discusses many ways we can expand our ministry.

00:12:19.179 --> 00:12:22.539
If we test Jehovah out in this way,

00:12:22.539 --> 00:12:26.700
we can be certain of his blessing.

00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:29.139
So what have we discussed?

00:12:29.139 --> 00:12:33.500
Keep the momentum of our special campaign going.

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:38.259
Continue to offer Bible studies at every opportunity.

00:12:38.259 --> 00:12:41.019
We also discussed the thrilling increases

00:12:41.019 --> 00:12:44.659
we're seeing in many parts of the world.

00:12:44.659 --> 00:12:47.500
May we all continue to pray that the master

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:51.059
sends out more workers into the harvest.

00:12:51.059 --> 00:12:53.620
And may we continue to do our personal best

00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:57.899
to preach and teach the good news of the kingdom.

00:12:57.899 --> 00:13:01.980
Be assured that we cherish each and every one of you,

00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:04.899
dear brothers and sisters.

00:13:04.899 --> 00:13:07.460
In the world headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:09.860
this is J.W. Broadcasting.
