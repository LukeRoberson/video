00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:09.439
All around the world, people come together every week at places of worship called

00:00:09.439 --> 00:00:17.850
Kingdom Halls. Have you ever wondered what happens inside a Kingdom Hall of

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:24.210
Jehovah's Witnesses? It's a place where Bible study programs and lectures are

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:32.359
held each week. The first time I attended a meeting I felt very happy. The

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:38.799
atmosphere was so good. I've never seen anything like it anywhere else. The

00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:47.520
people are loving, are the Lee and show an interesting people. Every meeting is

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:54.479
open to the public. Seats are free and no collections are ever taken. Families are

00:00:54.479 --> 00:01:02.479
invited to attend and learn together. All meetings begin and end with song and

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:10.180
prayer. One meeting usually held on the weekend includes a 30-minute Bible

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:15.620
discourse especially designed for the general public. After that there's a

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.299
question and answer discussion based on an article in the study edition of

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:25.500
The Watchtower magazine. Participation is always voluntary. At one of the

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.140
meetings during the week we not only study the Bible but also receive training

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:39.930
in public speaking. Everyone is invited to the Christian meetings including

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:47.109
those who are not Jehovah's Witnesses. You can go into any Kingdom Hall and

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:55.099
receive the same program of Bible instruction. Bible education, upbuilding

00:01:55.099 --> 00:02:00.060
association and the opportunity to praise God await you at Christian meetings

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:09.360
of Jehovah's Witnesses. To find a Kingdom Hall near you please visit the

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.840
