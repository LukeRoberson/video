00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:25.539
Welcome to JW Broadcasting for February 2023.

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:30.539
In January's program, we watched part one of the annual meeting.

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.539
At the live event, there was an air of excitement.

00:00:34.539 --> 00:00:38.539
The audience was eagerly awaiting what would be announced next.

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:42.539
And now that same excitement can be shared with all of you.

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:46.460
Please enjoy.

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.460
Well, we always enjoy hearing from our dear brother heard.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.460
So what's he going to talk to us about today?

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.460
Well, he's going to talk on the theme,

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.460
Are you a joyful person?

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.340
Brother heard, please.

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.340
When you think of your brain,

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:10.340
view it as a box that contains all sorts of information.

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.340
Good and bad.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.340
When you think of your heart,

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:21.340
view it as a bottle that contains only good information.

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:29.340
Now listen to this vintage old 1950s joy diswashing liquid soap commercial.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.340
Joy in a bottle beats anything in a box.

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:43.340
True joy from the heart beats a head full of knowledge.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.340
What about it?

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.340
Are you a joyful person?

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.340
What good is it?

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:57.340
Well, the Bible says a joyful heart makes for a cheerful countenance.

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:05.340
And it goes on to say a heart that is joyful does good to the body.

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.340
How does this work?

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:16.340
At times, your heart will make you smile when your body is in pain.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.340
For example, you pass another person,

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.340
and he or she says,

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.340
how are you?

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.340
You smile and say, good.

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.340
Your back, feet, and legs are killing you.

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:38.340
But your heart won't let you give a negative answer.

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.340
There are other more important reasons to be joyful.

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.340
Here's one.

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.340
Jehovah is a joyful person.

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.340
At 1 Timothy chapter 1 and verse 11,

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.340
he is called the happy God.

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.340
Now, a synonym is the joyful God.

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.340
He rejoices in his work.

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.340
Well, how do we know that?

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:13.340
Well, look at the 104th Psalm and verse 31.

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:18.340
The glory of Jehovah will last forever.

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.340
Jehovah will rejoice in his works.

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.340
Jehovah will rejoice in his work.

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:34.340
Synonyms are having joy or delight in his works.

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:39.340
Now, secondly, Jesus, too, is a happy worker.

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:45.340
At 1 Timothy chapter 6 and verse 14 and 15,

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.340
he's called the happy potentate.

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:56.340
Potentate is a powerful ruler, yet he is happy.

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:01.340
It was prophesied of him at Psalm 40 verse 8.

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:10.139
To do your will, oh my God, is my delight.

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:15.139
Now, this means to please greatly.

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:19.139
According to John chapter 4 and verse 34,

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:23.139
the doing of God's work was food for him.

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:28.139
It energized him and sustained him.

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:35.860
Doing God's will was like butter on his bread and milk in his glass.

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:41.720
Jehovah wants us to rejoice in our work.

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.720
Read with me, please.

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:48.720
Ecclesiastes chapter 5 and verse 19.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:55.720
Also, when the true God gives a man riches and material possessions

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.720
along with the ability to enjoy them,

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:05.720
take his reward and rejoice in his hard work.

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:09.720
This is the gift of God.

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:14.720
Housewives and mothers, rejoice in your work.

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:20.720
Husbands and fathers, rejoice in your work.

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:25.720
Single men and women, rejoice in your work.

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:33.129
Whittles and whittlers, rejoice in your work.

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:39.129
Oh, folks, rejoice in whatever you're able to do.

00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:42.129
Just call it work.

00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:47.540
Jehovah wants us to be joyful.

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:52.540
Do to run into chapter 16 and verse 15 comments this way.

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:58.540
Jehovah, your God will bless all that you do

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:02.540
and you will become nothing but joyful.

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:05.540
The best fathers are happy fathers.

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:09.540
The best husbands are happy husbands.

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:13.540
The best mothers are happy mothers.

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:17.540
The best children are obedient children.

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:23.939
Oops, I mean our happy children.

00:06:23.939 --> 00:06:27.939
Singing up building songs produces joy.

00:06:27.939 --> 00:06:31.939
Levite males sang at the temple.

00:06:31.939 --> 00:06:38.939
However, other singers and women are spoken of and scripture.

00:06:38.939 --> 00:06:42.939
At Acts 16, verse 25, it says,

00:06:42.939 --> 00:06:44.939
but about the middle of the night,

00:06:44.939 --> 00:06:51.939
Paul and Silas were praying and praising God with song

00:06:51.939 --> 00:06:55.939
and the prisoners were listening to them.

00:06:55.939 --> 00:06:59.939
Slaves used to sing while working.

00:06:59.939 --> 00:07:05.939
They did this to pass the time and lift their spirits to the highest joy.

00:07:05.939 --> 00:07:09.939
They sang out their struggle,

00:07:09.939 --> 00:07:16.939
weariness, loneliness, sorrow, hope,

00:07:16.939 --> 00:07:20.939
and determination for a better life.

00:07:20.939 --> 00:07:23.939
You can sing in the shower.

00:07:23.939 --> 00:07:28.339
Just make sure no one's listening.

00:07:28.339 --> 00:07:31.339
Count your blessings.

00:07:31.339 --> 00:07:34.339
Beath in the joy that they bring you.

00:07:34.339 --> 00:07:41.769
Joy is an aspect of God's Holy Spirit.

00:07:41.769 --> 00:07:45.769
It is the second of the nine aspects

00:07:45.769 --> 00:07:51.769
mentioned in Galatians chapter 5 and verse 22.

00:07:51.769 --> 00:07:56.769
Pray dearly for God's Holy Spirit to be with you in your life.

00:07:56.769 --> 00:08:04.500
Read with me, Daniel chapter 6 and verses 10 and 11.

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:09.500
But as soon as Daniel knew that the decree had been signed,

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:11.500
he went to his house,

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:18.500
which had the windows of his roof chamber open towards Jerusalem.

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:21.500
And three times a day,

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:26.500
he got down on his knees and prayed

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:30.500
and offered praise before his God,

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:35.500
as he had regularly done prior to this.

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:42.500
At that time, those men burst in and found Daniel petitioning

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:47.500
and pleading for a favor before his God.

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:53.500
My wife Gloria and I used to get down on our knees

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:56.500
to pray before going to bed.

00:08:56.500 --> 00:09:01.500
Now that we're old, we just sit on the side of the bed and pray.

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:07.019
If we get down, we can't get up.

00:09:07.019 --> 00:09:10.019
Keep in mind that prayer will produce in you joy.

00:09:10.019 --> 00:09:16.529
You're not alone. Jehovah is with you.

00:09:16.529 --> 00:09:20.529
He is never far away.

00:09:20.529 --> 00:09:26.529
At Acts 1727, Paul told some in Athens,

00:09:26.529 --> 00:09:31.529
he is not far off from each one of us.

00:09:31.529 --> 00:09:36.529
He can see you and hear you from heaven,

00:09:36.529 --> 00:09:39.529
wherever heaven is located.

00:09:39.529 --> 00:09:45.529
Never should we feel that we are alone.

00:09:45.529 --> 00:09:49.529
Each minute of every day,

00:09:49.529 --> 00:09:53.529
Jehovah is right beside us,

00:09:53.529 --> 00:09:57.529
looking for opportunities to help us.

00:09:57.529 --> 00:10:01.809
Talk to him regularly.

00:10:01.809 --> 00:10:06.950
Ask him to give you joy.

00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:09.950
Angels two are joyful.

00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:13.950
Luke chapter 15, verse 10 says that they're joyful.

00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:16.950
Please look at it as we read it.

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:19.950
In the same way, I tell you,

00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:24.950
joy arises among the angels of God

00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:28.950
over one sinner who repents.

00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:30.950
What do you think?

00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:34.950
Are you a joyful person?

00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:38.950
Try to remember the box.

00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:41.950
Put your mind to it.

00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:43.950
And the bottle.

00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:47.950
Put your heart into it.

00:10:48.950 --> 00:10:53.950
Copy as best you can those who are joyful.

00:10:53.950 --> 00:10:55.950
Jehovah.

00:10:55.950 --> 00:10:57.950
Jesus.

00:10:57.950 --> 00:10:59.950
The angels.

00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:03.950
Your spiritual brothers and sisters.

00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:07.950
Pray daily for a joyful countenance.

00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:15.419
A warm smile does good to the body.

00:11:15.419 --> 00:11:18.419
One secular song makes this point.

00:11:18.419 --> 00:11:19.419
I won't sing it.

00:11:19.419 --> 00:11:22.960
I'll just say it.

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:26.960
Light up your face with gladness.

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:31.960
Hide every trace of sadness.

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:36.960
Although a tear may be ever so near,

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:41.960
that's the time you must keep on trying.

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:42.960
Smile.

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:45.960
What's the use of crying?

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:48.960
You'll find that life is still worthwhile.

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:52.960
If you just smile.

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:58.039
If you are a joyful person,

00:11:58.039 --> 00:12:00.039
thank Jehovah.

00:12:00.039 --> 00:12:06.450
If you are lacking joy, work on being more joyful.

00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:15.450
Remember, Jehovah wants you to be nothing but joyful.

00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:21.450
Let's make it our aim to please him with joy.

00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:32.029
Isn't that delightful?

00:12:32.029 --> 00:12:34.029
Thank you very much, Sam.

00:12:34.029 --> 00:12:36.029
That was just wonderful.

00:12:36.029 --> 00:12:39.029
Now we're going to watch two videos.

00:12:39.029 --> 00:12:42.029
The first one is going to bring us up to date

00:12:42.029 --> 00:12:45.029
with the instruction projects that were finished

00:12:45.029 --> 00:12:48.029
just before the COVID began.

00:12:48.029 --> 00:12:53.029
But then it's also going to tell us the work that was done

00:12:53.029 --> 00:12:55.029
during the COVID outbreak.

00:12:55.029 --> 00:12:58.029
Our brothers did not stop working during the outbreak.

00:12:58.029 --> 00:13:00.029
And they were very resourceful.

00:13:00.029 --> 00:13:02.029
They did a lot of good things.

00:13:02.029 --> 00:13:04.029
So let's watch this video.

00:13:04.029 --> 00:13:07.889
It's going to be very encouraging.

00:13:07.889 --> 00:13:10.889
At Isaiah 40 verses four and five,

00:13:10.889 --> 00:13:14.889
Jehovah says he would remove seemingly insurmountable obstacles

00:13:14.889 --> 00:13:18.889
so the Jews could return to Jerusalem.

00:13:18.889 --> 00:13:22.889
The account says, let every valley be raised up

00:13:22.889 --> 00:13:25.889
and every mountain and hill be made low.

00:13:25.889 --> 00:13:27.889
The rough ground must become level

00:13:27.889 --> 00:13:30.889
and the rugged ground of valley plain.

00:13:30.889 --> 00:13:32.889
The glory of Jehovah will be revealed

00:13:32.889 --> 00:13:35.889
and all flesh will see it together

00:13:35.889 --> 00:13:38.889
for the mouth of Jehovah has spoken.

00:13:38.889 --> 00:13:42.889
This inspiring prophecy was initially fulfilled

00:13:42.889 --> 00:13:45.889
in 537 BCE.

00:13:45.889 --> 00:13:48.889
There is nothing that can stand in the way

00:13:48.889 --> 00:13:50.889
of what Jehovah wants accomplished.

00:13:50.889 --> 00:13:52.889
In this report,

00:13:52.889 --> 00:13:55.889
we will seek clear evidence of Jehovah's support

00:13:55.889 --> 00:13:58.889
on theocratic projects today,

00:13:58.889 --> 00:14:00.889
despite a pandemic,

00:14:00.889 --> 00:14:02.889
supply chain shortages,

00:14:02.889 --> 00:14:04.889
and other challenges.

00:14:04.889 --> 00:14:06.889
For example,

00:14:06.889 --> 00:14:08.889
the February 2020 announcement featured

00:14:08.889 --> 00:14:10.889
in the JW newsroom

00:14:10.889 --> 00:14:14.889
informed us that the Cameroon Branch Relocation Project

00:14:14.889 --> 00:14:18.889
finished shortly before the outbreak of COVID-19.

00:14:18.889 --> 00:14:19.889
Just in time,

00:14:19.889 --> 00:14:21.889
the Bethel family had a home

00:14:21.889 --> 00:14:24.889
where they could safely shelter in place during the pandemic.

00:14:24.889 --> 00:14:27.889
And still care for the Kingdom work

00:14:27.889 --> 00:14:29.889
and more than 48,000 publishers

00:14:29.889 --> 00:14:32.889
in that branch territory.

00:14:32.889 --> 00:14:34.889
The Argentina Bethel family also moved

00:14:34.889 --> 00:14:37.889
into their new branch facility in Buenos Aires,

00:14:37.889 --> 00:14:39.889
shortly thereafter.

00:14:39.889 --> 00:14:41.889
The move, which was organized in compliance

00:14:41.889 --> 00:14:44.889
with COVID-19 safety protocols,

00:14:44.889 --> 00:14:47.889
began in July 2021.

00:14:47.889 --> 00:14:49.889
The Bethel family saw numerous examples

00:14:49.889 --> 00:14:51.889
of Jehovah leveling out

00:14:51.889 --> 00:14:56.889
overwhelming challenges during the pandemic.

00:14:56.889 --> 00:14:59.889
Successful completion of the new branch facilities

00:14:59.889 --> 00:15:01.889
in the midst of that turmoil

00:15:01.889 --> 00:15:05.889
has already given a great witness to the community.

00:15:05.889 --> 00:15:08.889
It has allowed the Bethel family to focus on caring

00:15:08.889 --> 00:15:12.889
for close to 170,000 publishers

00:15:12.889 --> 00:15:15.889
in that branch territory.

00:15:15.889 --> 00:15:18.889
What a blessing to have these new facilities

00:15:18.889 --> 00:15:21.889
to support the Kingdom Preaching Work.

00:15:21.889 --> 00:15:24.889
What about projects happening right now?

00:15:24.889 --> 00:15:26.889
Listen closely,

00:15:26.889 --> 00:15:30.889
as we hear updates from brothers in Italy,

00:15:30.889 --> 00:15:35.580
Congo, and Angola.

00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:38.580
The Italy branch is relocating its facilities

00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:40.580
to the city of Bologna in Northern Italy,

00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:43.580
which is located about 370 kilometers

00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:46.580
or 230 miles from Rome.

00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:48.580
Initially,

00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:50.580
the construction project committee

00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:53.580
wanted to use her brothers and sisters as volunteers.

00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:55.580
However, at a certain point,

00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:59.580
it was decided to rely on an outside development company,

00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:02.580
both for the design and renovation

00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:05.580
of the office building that was purchased,

00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:07.580
as well as for the design and construction

00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:09.580
of the residential buildings.

00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:13.179
When this decision was made,

00:16:13.179 --> 00:16:16.179
we did not imagine that a few months afterwards,

00:16:16.179 --> 00:16:19.179
we would not be able to use our volunteers.

00:16:19.179 --> 00:16:22.179
Because at the beginning of 2020,

00:16:22.179 --> 00:16:24.179
COVID-19 struck Northern Italy,

00:16:24.179 --> 00:16:26.179
including the city of Bologna.

00:16:26.179 --> 00:16:28.179
As a consequence,

00:16:28.179 --> 00:16:30.179
the government suspended activities,

00:16:30.179 --> 00:16:34.549
including construction.

00:16:34.549 --> 00:16:35.549
After about one month,

00:16:35.549 --> 00:16:37.549
they lifted the restrictions.

00:16:37.549 --> 00:16:39.549
And as a result,

00:16:39.549 --> 00:16:41.549
we could get back in touch with the companies

00:16:41.549 --> 00:16:43.549
and continue the work,

00:16:43.549 --> 00:16:46.549
while respecting government protocol

00:16:46.549 --> 00:16:49.549
and direction from our organization.

00:16:49.549 --> 00:16:51.549
Thanks to Jehovah's direction,

00:16:51.549 --> 00:16:53.549
despite the pandemic,

00:16:53.549 --> 00:16:55.549
we are happy to see how this project

00:16:55.549 --> 00:16:58.549
is moving forward much faster than we expected.

00:16:58.549 --> 00:17:01.549
And we look forward to being able to move

00:17:01.549 --> 00:17:05.549
into these new buildings by the end of 2024.

00:17:05.549 --> 00:17:07.549
In 2012,

00:17:07.549 --> 00:17:11.549
we had a little of 168,000 publishers

00:17:11.549 --> 00:17:13.549
in our branch territory.

00:17:13.549 --> 00:17:15.549
By the end of 2021,

00:17:15.549 --> 00:17:17.549
the total number of publishers

00:17:17.549 --> 00:17:21.549
grew to more than 209,000 publishers.

00:17:21.549 --> 00:17:23.549
Because it was in practical

00:17:23.549 --> 00:17:26.549
to expand the branch facility in Kinchasa,

00:17:26.549 --> 00:17:27.549
we looked for a property

00:17:27.549 --> 00:17:29.549
that could care for the immediate

00:17:29.549 --> 00:17:32.549
and future needs of the branch.

00:17:32.549 --> 00:17:34.549
We purchased property

00:17:34.549 --> 00:17:36.549
in the country's second largest city,

00:17:36.549 --> 00:17:37.549
Lubumbashi,

00:17:37.549 --> 00:17:40.549
where a developer was already building housing

00:17:40.549 --> 00:17:42.549
and office units.

00:17:42.549 --> 00:17:44.549
The developer already had the zoning,

00:17:44.549 --> 00:17:46.549
permits,

00:17:46.549 --> 00:17:48.549
and completed design packages.

00:17:48.549 --> 00:17:50.549
This saved much time

00:17:50.549 --> 00:17:52.549
and allowed the projects to move ahead

00:17:52.549 --> 00:17:54.549
with minimal disruption,

00:17:54.549 --> 00:17:56.549
even during the pandemic.

00:17:56.549 --> 00:17:58.549
And we were happy for that.

00:17:58.549 --> 00:18:01.549
For the internal work of the new offices,

00:18:01.549 --> 00:18:03.549
we needed a contractor

00:18:03.549 --> 00:18:05.549
who could design

00:18:05.549 --> 00:18:08.549
and install to the standards of our organization,

00:18:08.549 --> 00:18:10.549
and within the project budget.

00:18:10.549 --> 00:18:13.549
We knew this would be hard to find in Congo,

00:18:13.549 --> 00:18:15.549
and even harder,

00:18:15.549 --> 00:18:17.549
with the limitations of the pandemic.

00:18:17.549 --> 00:18:19.549
One of the suppliers

00:18:19.549 --> 00:18:21.549
that we use for food

00:18:21.549 --> 00:18:23.549
and relief supplies in the area,

00:18:23.549 --> 00:18:25.549
mentioned to us that

00:18:25.549 --> 00:18:27.549
they have a partner company

00:18:27.549 --> 00:18:29.549
who specializes in construction

00:18:29.549 --> 00:18:31.549
and is newly active in the country.

00:18:31.549 --> 00:18:33.549
We didn't expect that the answer

00:18:33.549 --> 00:18:35.549
to this challenge would come

00:18:35.549 --> 00:18:37.549
from this unusual direction.

00:18:37.549 --> 00:18:39.549
But we were surprised to find that

00:18:39.549 --> 00:18:41.549
they did in fact qualify

00:18:41.549 --> 00:18:43.549
to meet the high standards

00:18:43.549 --> 00:18:47.549
and expectations of such a branch project.

00:18:47.549 --> 00:18:49.549
As the relationship grew,

00:18:49.549 --> 00:18:51.549
we saw fine collaboration

00:18:51.549 --> 00:18:53.549
between our teams,

00:18:53.549 --> 00:18:55.549
and they continue to work along with us

00:18:55.549 --> 00:18:57.549
now as the project expands.

00:18:57.549 --> 00:18:59.549
We truly have seen

00:18:59.549 --> 00:19:01.549
Jehovah's moving out

00:19:01.549 --> 00:19:03.549
the path for this project.

00:19:03.549 --> 00:19:05.549
We have already started moving

00:19:05.549 --> 00:19:07.549
some Bethelites to this new site

00:19:07.549 --> 00:19:09.549
and look forward to the project's completion

00:19:09.549 --> 00:19:11.549
in mid-2024.

00:19:11.549 --> 00:19:15.059
In December 2021,

00:19:15.059 --> 00:19:17.059
a building was purchased

00:19:17.059 --> 00:19:19.059
that will provide additional rooms

00:19:19.059 --> 00:19:21.059
and offices for the Bethel family

00:19:21.059 --> 00:19:23.059
at our branch.

00:19:23.059 --> 00:19:26.660
This building is located

00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:28.660
about a 10-minute walk

00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:30.660
from the current Bethel facility.

00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:32.660
Because of the restrictions

00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:34.660
imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic,

00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:36.660
the entire process

00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:38.660
for the acquisition of this building,

00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:40.660
even including the verification

00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:42.660
of the legal aspects

00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:46.660
had to be done by video conference.

00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:48.660
During the last week

00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:50.660
of the negotiation process,

00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:52.660
when there were just five days remaining

00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:54.660
to sign the purchase and sale agreement,

00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:56.660
and during a stage

00:19:56.660 --> 00:19:58.660
in which the negotiation team

00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:00.660
from the branch in the seller

00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:02.660
had already agreed on the purchase

00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:04.660
and sale price,

00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:06.660
we discovered that the structure

00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:08.660
of the building needed some repairs

00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:12.660
and reinforcements in some areas.

00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:14.660
How did the team negotiating the purchase

00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:16.660
handle this obstacle?

00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:20.450
The seller was asked to take

00:20:20.450 --> 00:20:22.450
responsibility for the repairs

00:20:22.450 --> 00:20:26.450
and to reinforce the building structure,

00:20:26.450 --> 00:20:28.450
closely following the engineering details

00:20:28.450 --> 00:20:30.450
that would be provided

00:20:30.450 --> 00:20:32.450
by the branch.

00:20:32.450 --> 00:20:34.450
After several prayers

00:20:34.450 --> 00:20:36.450
by the branch's negotiation team,

00:20:36.450 --> 00:20:40.450
the seller accepted the responsibility

00:20:40.450 --> 00:20:42.450
and even paid

00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:44.450
for all the expenses involved

00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:49.170
in this repair.

00:20:49.170 --> 00:20:51.170
The repair was completed

00:20:51.170 --> 00:20:53.170
and shortly after,

00:20:53.170 --> 00:20:55.170
the work to completely renovate the building

00:20:55.170 --> 00:20:57.170
began.

00:20:57.170 --> 00:20:59.170
We look forward to seeing some

00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:01.170
of the Bethel family move

00:21:01.170 --> 00:21:03.170
into this new building

00:21:03.170 --> 00:21:05.170
in early 2024.

00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:07.170
In addition to these

00:21:07.170 --> 00:21:09.170
new branch facilities,

00:21:09.170 --> 00:21:11.170
we also have many other needs

00:21:11.170 --> 00:21:13.170
to fill.

00:21:13.170 --> 00:21:15.170
For example, in order to train

00:21:15.170 --> 00:21:17.170
brothers and sisters to carry out

00:21:17.170 --> 00:21:19.170
the preaching and teaching work,

00:21:19.170 --> 00:21:21.170
there continues to be a need

00:21:21.170 --> 00:21:23.170
for theocratic school facilities.

00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:25.170
In Madagascar,

00:21:25.170 --> 00:21:27.170
the branch hosted classes

00:21:27.170 --> 00:21:29.170
at Bethel because they didn't

00:21:29.170 --> 00:21:31.170
have any other suitable facilities.

00:21:31.170 --> 00:21:33.170
Well, in June 2021,

00:21:33.170 --> 00:21:35.170
they finished construction

00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:37.170
of a new school facility

00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:39.170
and will now be able

00:21:39.170 --> 00:21:41.170
to schedule up to four classes

00:21:41.170 --> 00:21:43.170
there each year.

00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:45.170
Currently, there are

00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:47.170
over 40 existing school facilities

00:21:47.170 --> 00:21:49.170
and we have around 20 active

00:21:49.170 --> 00:21:51.170
school facility projects

00:21:51.170 --> 00:21:53.170
at various stages of development.

00:21:53.170 --> 00:21:56.859
What about facilities

00:21:56.859 --> 00:21:58.859
to support the growing

00:21:58.859 --> 00:22:00.859
media production of the organization?

00:22:00.859 --> 00:22:02.859
We're happy to report

00:22:02.859 --> 00:22:04.859
that we have finished the studio projects

00:22:04.859 --> 00:22:06.859
in South Africa and

00:22:06.859 --> 00:22:08.859
Australasia branches.

00:22:08.859 --> 00:22:10.859
In Australasia,

00:22:10.859 --> 00:22:12.859
that includes the back lot

00:22:12.859 --> 00:22:14.859
that is used for the good news

00:22:14.859 --> 00:22:16.859
according to Jesus' video series.

00:22:16.859 --> 00:22:18.859
Soon, if Jehovah wills,

00:22:18.859 --> 00:22:20.859
we will begin construction

00:22:20.859 --> 00:22:22.859
on the new site in Ramippo, New York.

00:22:22.859 --> 00:22:24.859
We look forward to seeing

00:22:24.859 --> 00:22:26.859
how Jehovah uses this facility

00:22:26.859 --> 00:22:28.859
to care for the needs of his people.

00:22:28.859 --> 00:22:30.859
It is clear

00:22:30.859 --> 00:22:32.859
that neither the pandemic

00:22:32.859 --> 00:22:34.859
nor ongoing turmoil

00:22:34.859 --> 00:22:36.859
in this world has been able

00:22:36.859 --> 00:22:38.859
to stop theocratic building projects.

00:22:38.859 --> 00:22:42.859
And as world conditions continue to deteriorate,

00:22:42.859 --> 00:22:44.859
we are confident

00:22:44.859 --> 00:22:48.859
that the words of Isaiah 44 and 5

00:22:48.859 --> 00:22:50.859
will be true for us.

00:22:50.859 --> 00:22:52.859
Yes, Jehovah will help us overcome

00:22:52.859 --> 00:22:54.859
any mountain-like obstacles

00:22:54.859 --> 00:22:56.859
that we face.

00:22:56.859 --> 00:22:58.859
We earnestly pray

00:22:58.859 --> 00:23:00.859
for Jehovah to bless these

00:23:00.859 --> 00:23:02.859
and future building projects.

00:23:02.859 --> 00:23:04.859
And we thank you,

00:23:04.859 --> 00:23:06.859
dear brothers and sisters,

00:23:06.859 --> 00:23:08.859
for supporting them

00:23:08.859 --> 00:23:10.859
by means of your prayers,

00:23:10.859 --> 00:23:12.859
skills, time,

00:23:12.859 --> 00:23:14.859
and resources.

00:23:14.859 --> 00:23:16.859
May all praise and glory

00:23:16.859 --> 00:23:18.859
go to our great God, Jehovah,

00:23:18.859 --> 00:23:20.859
who continues

00:23:20.859 --> 00:23:22.859
to clear the way for us.

00:23:22.859 --> 00:23:34.769
Jehovah's hand is never short.

00:23:34.769 --> 00:23:36.769
Well, the next part

00:23:36.769 --> 00:23:38.769
is a video

00:23:38.769 --> 00:23:40.769
entitled Patterson

00:23:40.769 --> 00:23:42.769
Visitor Center Update.

00:23:42.769 --> 00:23:46.769
Try saying that fast three times.

00:23:46.769 --> 00:23:48.769
That was a mouthful.

00:23:48.769 --> 00:23:50.769
Patterson Visitor Center Update.

00:23:50.769 --> 00:23:52.769
This is about more than just

00:23:52.769 --> 00:23:54.769
a visitor center

00:23:54.769 --> 00:23:56.769
where people can come

00:23:56.769 --> 00:23:58.769
to wait their turn to tour Bethel.

00:23:58.769 --> 00:24:00.769
You're going to see that

00:24:00.769 --> 00:24:02.769
there are some surprises waiting for us

00:24:02.769 --> 00:24:04.769
in this visitor center.

00:24:04.769 --> 00:24:08.779
Let's watch.

00:24:08.779 --> 00:24:10.779
Planning for the new Patterson Visitor Center

00:24:10.779 --> 00:24:12.779
began in 2018.

00:24:12.779 --> 00:24:14.779
A project development group

00:24:14.779 --> 00:24:16.779
was formed with a goal

00:24:16.779 --> 00:24:18.779
of starting construction,

00:24:18.779 --> 00:24:20.779
but unforeseen challenges

00:24:20.779 --> 00:24:22.779
were about to occur.

00:24:22.779 --> 00:24:24.779
In March of 2020,

00:24:24.779 --> 00:24:26.779
an outbreak of COVID-19 in the New York

00:24:26.779 --> 00:24:28.779
area caused Bethel to go

00:24:28.779 --> 00:24:30.779
into a full lockdown.

00:24:30.779 --> 00:24:32.779
How did the design group

00:24:32.779 --> 00:24:34.779
siege Jehovah's blessing on the project

00:24:34.779 --> 00:24:36.779
during this unprecedented time?

00:24:36.779 --> 00:24:40.099
Well, when Bethel locked down

00:24:40.099 --> 00:24:42.099
and suspended in-person meetings,

00:24:42.099 --> 00:24:44.099
so did the town of Patterson.

00:24:44.099 --> 00:24:46.099
This created a series

00:24:46.099 --> 00:24:48.099
challenge for us to obtain

00:24:48.099 --> 00:24:50.099
the necessary approvals

00:24:50.099 --> 00:24:52.099
and to keep the project moving forward.

00:24:52.099 --> 00:24:54.099
So with a threat of falling

00:24:54.099 --> 00:24:56.099
months behind,

00:24:56.099 --> 00:24:58.099
we had to rely on Jehovah

00:24:58.099 --> 00:25:00.099
and alter our approach.

00:25:00.099 --> 00:25:02.099
So a local elder was given

00:25:02.099 --> 00:25:04.099
permission to attend the town

00:25:04.099 --> 00:25:06.099
and opened up.

00:25:06.099 --> 00:25:08.099
He allowed us as a design team

00:25:08.099 --> 00:25:10.099
to make a presentation effectively

00:25:10.099 --> 00:25:12.099
but remotely.

00:25:12.099 --> 00:25:14.099
We saw Jehovah's hand

00:25:14.099 --> 00:25:16.099
and his blessing on this entire arrangement.

00:25:16.099 --> 00:25:18.099
So through months of meetings,

00:25:18.099 --> 00:25:20.099
we were able to get the approvals needed

00:25:20.099 --> 00:25:22.099
and then get a building permit

00:25:22.099 --> 00:25:24.099
to begin construction

00:25:24.099 --> 00:25:28.430
all of this taking place

00:25:28.430 --> 00:25:30.430
during the lockdown.

00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:32.430
Following all the local guidelines,

00:25:32.430 --> 00:25:34.430
the branch found a way

00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:36.430
to properly

00:25:36.430 --> 00:25:38.430
so they could work on the project.

00:25:38.430 --> 00:25:40.430
Jehovah caused many volunteers

00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:45.019
to offer themselves willingly

00:25:45.019 --> 00:25:47.019
to help.

00:25:47.019 --> 00:25:49.019
Here we are building

00:25:49.019 --> 00:25:51.019
the Patterson Visitor Center

00:25:51.019 --> 00:25:53.019
during a most unique time in history

00:25:53.019 --> 00:25:55.019
in the midst of a global pandemic.

00:25:55.019 --> 00:25:57.019
The Brotherhood

00:25:57.019 --> 00:25:59.019
has demonstrated a heart for the work.

00:25:59.019 --> 00:26:01.019
Through contributions,

00:26:01.019 --> 00:26:03.019
brothers and sisters offering their skills,

00:26:03.019 --> 00:26:05.019
some of which are quite unique.

00:26:05.019 --> 00:26:07.019
It's so encouraging to see

00:26:07.019 --> 00:26:09.019
how Jehovah has come to our aid

00:26:09.019 --> 00:26:11.019
with supply issues

00:26:11.019 --> 00:26:13.019
and how Bethel departments

00:26:13.019 --> 00:26:15.019
have cooperated and provided

00:26:15.019 --> 00:26:17.019
skilled people to help us.

00:26:17.019 --> 00:26:19.019
It's been so encouraging.

00:26:19.019 --> 00:26:21.019
All involved have seen Jehovah's hand

00:26:21.019 --> 00:26:23.019
guiding the way through these

00:26:23.019 --> 00:26:25.019
challenging circumstances.

00:26:25.019 --> 00:26:27.019
But some may wonder,

00:26:27.019 --> 00:26:29.019
at a time when guests are not allowed

00:26:29.019 --> 00:26:31.019
on Bethel property,

00:26:31.019 --> 00:26:33.019
why is this Visitor Center so important

00:26:33.019 --> 00:26:35.019
to Jehovah?

00:26:35.019 --> 00:26:37.019
The physical buildings at Bethel

00:26:37.019 --> 00:26:39.019
are attractive.

00:26:39.019 --> 00:26:41.019
But what's more valuable to Jehovah

00:26:41.019 --> 00:26:43.019
is what happens inside.

00:26:43.019 --> 00:26:45.019
It's the spiritual gift that he has

00:26:45.019 --> 00:26:47.019
in store for all who come to visit

00:26:47.019 --> 00:26:49.019
that is so important.

00:26:49.019 --> 00:26:51.019
The Patterson Visitor Center

00:26:51.019 --> 00:26:53.019
is designed to be an immersive

00:26:53.019 --> 00:26:55.019
theocratic experience

00:26:55.019 --> 00:27:09.859
for everyone.

00:27:09.859 --> 00:27:11.859
The Patterson Visitor Center

00:27:11.859 --> 00:27:13.859
will feature three museums

00:27:13.859 --> 00:27:15.859
in this way.

00:27:15.859 --> 00:27:17.859
Our feature museum

00:27:17.859 --> 00:27:19.859
will be a first-century Bible village.

00:27:19.859 --> 00:27:26.779
The objective

00:27:26.779 --> 00:27:28.779
is to educate visitors

00:27:28.779 --> 00:27:30.779
about what life was like

00:27:30.779 --> 00:27:32.779
in the first century.

00:27:32.779 --> 00:27:34.779
And thereby, bring Bible accounts

00:27:34.779 --> 00:27:36.779
to life.

00:27:36.779 --> 00:27:38.779
You will get a sense of what things

00:27:38.779 --> 00:27:40.779
were like when Jesus walked the earth.

00:27:40.779 --> 00:27:42.779
Since the Israelites

00:27:42.779 --> 00:27:44.779
lived off the land,

00:27:44.779 --> 00:27:46.779
the experience begins

00:27:46.779 --> 00:27:48.779
with an overview of the annual crop

00:27:48.779 --> 00:27:50.779
cycles that form the core

00:27:50.779 --> 00:27:54.779
of so much of their daily activities.

00:27:54.779 --> 00:27:56.779
Key agricultural tasks,

00:27:56.779 --> 00:27:58.779
such as threshing, winnowing

00:27:58.779 --> 00:28:00.779
and grinding grain,

00:28:00.779 --> 00:28:02.779
will be illustrated

00:28:02.779 --> 00:28:06.509
with interactive displays.

00:28:06.509 --> 00:28:08.509
We know you will find the exhibit components

00:28:08.509 --> 00:28:10.509
like the functioning olive press

00:28:10.509 --> 00:28:12.509
and wine press,

00:28:12.509 --> 00:28:14.509
very interesting and informative.

00:28:14.509 --> 00:28:30.299
The next stop

00:28:30.299 --> 00:28:32.299
will be a typical first-century market.

00:28:32.299 --> 00:28:34.299
Here you will see some

00:28:34.299 --> 00:28:36.299
of the food and goods

00:28:36.299 --> 00:28:38.299
that would have been available

00:28:38.299 --> 00:28:40.299
depending on the season of the year.

00:28:40.299 --> 00:28:42.299
We next invite you

00:28:42.299 --> 00:28:44.299
into the residence

00:28:44.299 --> 00:28:46.299
and workshop spaces

00:28:46.299 --> 00:28:48.299
of a typical first-century

00:28:48.299 --> 00:28:50.299
Israelite family.

00:28:50.299 --> 00:28:53.710
The manger,

00:28:53.710 --> 00:28:55.710
carpentry shop,

00:28:55.710 --> 00:28:57.710
weaving and fabric-dying displays

00:28:57.710 --> 00:28:59.710
will illustrate a number

00:28:59.710 --> 00:29:01.710
of Israelite activities.

00:29:01.710 --> 00:29:03.710
The resident's courtyard area

00:29:03.710 --> 00:29:05.710
will show other regular home

00:29:05.710 --> 00:29:07.710
tasks like grain grinding

00:29:07.710 --> 00:29:09.710
and basket making.

00:29:09.710 --> 00:29:11.710
We next invite you

00:29:11.710 --> 00:29:13.710
into a typical Israelite home

00:29:13.710 --> 00:29:15.710
and out onto a rooftop

00:29:15.710 --> 00:29:17.710
overlooking the rest of the village.

00:29:17.710 --> 00:29:22.269
Before you leave the residences,

00:29:22.269 --> 00:29:24.269
you will also see an upper room

00:29:24.269 --> 00:29:26.269
that would have been

00:29:26.269 --> 00:29:28.269
in some of the Israelite homes.

00:29:28.269 --> 00:29:32.000
The next area

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.000
of the first-century

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.000
Bible village that you can explore

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.619
is the synagogue,

00:29:40.619 --> 00:29:42.619
which was the center of worship

00:29:42.619 --> 00:29:44.619
and study in the Jewish community.

00:29:44.619 --> 00:29:46.619
Next, a functioning

00:29:46.619 --> 00:29:48.619
pottery wheel in kiln

00:29:48.619 --> 00:29:50.619
will illustrate how pottery was made.

00:29:50.619 --> 00:29:52.619
The last stop

00:29:52.619 --> 00:29:54.619
will take you to a lake side

00:29:54.619 --> 00:29:56.619
where you will be able to board

00:29:56.619 --> 00:29:58.619
a first-century fishing boat

00:29:58.619 --> 00:30:00.619
similar to the one

00:30:00.619 --> 00:30:02.619
that Jesus and His disciples used.

00:30:02.619 --> 00:30:04.619
Here you can learn

00:30:04.619 --> 00:30:06.619
what was involved in commercial fishing.

00:30:06.619 --> 00:30:24.299
This

00:30:24.299 --> 00:30:26.299
and so much more

00:30:26.299 --> 00:30:28.299
is waiting for you

00:30:28.299 --> 00:30:30.299
at the New Patterson Visitor Center.

00:30:30.299 --> 00:30:32.299
We can't wait for you to come

00:30:32.299 --> 00:30:34.299
and see the beautiful

00:30:34.299 --> 00:30:36.299
spiritual gift

00:30:36.299 --> 00:30:38.299
that is waiting for you.

00:30:38.299 --> 00:30:48.559
The New Visitor Center

00:30:48.559 --> 00:30:50.559
and Museum are on course

00:30:50.559 --> 00:30:52.559
to be completed in the fall of 2023.

00:30:52.559 --> 00:30:54.559
When will guests be able

00:30:54.559 --> 00:30:56.559
to come back to Bethleh

00:30:56.559 --> 00:30:58.559
and tour the new facility?

00:30:58.559 --> 00:31:00.559
We are going to have to wait and see.

00:31:00.559 --> 00:31:02.559
But one thing is for sure,

00:31:02.559 --> 00:31:04.559
when the doors finally

00:31:04.559 --> 00:31:06.559
do open, anyone who makes

00:31:06.559 --> 00:31:08.559
the effort to come

00:31:08.559 --> 00:31:10.559
will receive a spiritual gift from Jehovah.

00:31:10.559 --> 00:31:12.559
The touring experience

00:31:12.559 --> 00:31:14.559
will prove to be a spiritual

00:31:14.559 --> 00:31:16.559
encouragement to the

00:31:16.559 --> 00:31:18.559
worldwide brotherhood

00:31:18.559 --> 00:31:20.559
and promote pure worship

00:31:20.559 --> 00:31:22.559
to Jehovah's praise and honor

00:31:22.559 --> 00:31:23.559
in a very unique way.

00:31:23.559 --> 00:31:25.559
It will certainly be

00:31:25.559 --> 00:31:27.559
a must see.

00:31:27.559 --> 00:31:29.559
Well, we've seen the blessings on this project

00:31:29.559 --> 00:31:31.559
and really all the people working hard on it.

00:31:31.559 --> 00:31:33.559
The facility is going to benefit

00:31:33.559 --> 00:31:35.559
thousands of future visitors.

00:31:35.559 --> 00:31:37.559
It's because

00:31:37.559 --> 00:31:39.559
all of us, either now

00:31:39.559 --> 00:31:41.559
or in the new world,

00:31:41.559 --> 00:31:43.559
need to be taught about the life

00:31:43.559 --> 00:31:45.559
and ministry of Jesus.

00:31:45.559 --> 00:31:47.559
For this reason, we're convinced

00:31:47.559 --> 00:31:49.559
of Jehovah's blessing on the project

00:31:49.559 --> 00:31:51.559
and his desire to have this facility built.

00:31:51.559 --> 00:31:53.559
It's Jehovah's desire that people

00:31:53.559 --> 00:31:55.559
come to his house and be refreshed

00:31:55.559 --> 00:31:57.559
and educated.

00:31:57.559 --> 00:31:59.559
It is our prayer

00:31:59.559 --> 00:32:01.559
that this new and thrilling

00:32:01.559 --> 00:32:03.559
visitors center will accomplish that.

00:32:03.559 --> 00:32:05.559
Yes, we'll come.

00:32:05.559 --> 00:32:07.559
They will be up built

00:32:07.559 --> 00:32:09.559
and they will draw closer

00:32:09.559 --> 00:32:21.640
to Jehovah God.

00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:23.640
I'm sure we can hardly wait to go through

00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:25.640
that new visitor center. I know

00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:27.640
I can hardly wait.

00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:29.640
Now we're going to enjoy two talks on very

00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:31.640
encouraging themes.

00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:33.640
The first is by brother Kenneth Cook,

00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:35.640
his subject,

00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:37.640
the earth that will endure forever.

00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:39.640
Brother Cook, please.

00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:43.640
In the revelation presented to the Apostle John,

00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:47.640
Jesus pointed ahead many centuries to the time

00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:49.640
when Jehovah brings an end to those

00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:51.640
who oppose his kingdom.

00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:53.640
At Revelation 11 and verse 18,

00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:55.640
it speaks of such opposers

00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:57.640
as those ruining the earth.

00:32:57.640 --> 00:32:59.640
In its entirety,

00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:01.640
the verse says this,

00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:05.640
Revelation 11 verse 18.

00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:07.640
But the nations became

00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:09.640
wrathful,

00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:11.640
and your own wrath came,

00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:13.640
and the appointed time came

00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:15.640
for the dead to be judged,

00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:17.640
and to reward your slaves,

00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:19.640
the prophets,

00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:21.640
and the holy ones,

00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:23.640
and those fearing your name,

00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:25.640
the small and the great,

00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:27.640
ruining the earth.

00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:29.640
This verse assures us

00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:31.640
that Jehovah is going to stop

00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:35.640
the ruining of the earth.

00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:37.640
But is it only man's

00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:39.640
pollution of the earth,

00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:41.640
and the misuse of its resources

00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:43.640
that is being spoken of here,

00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:45.640
or is there more to it?

00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:47.640
To answer those questions,

00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:49.640
here are four main points

00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:51.640
that we will consider.

00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:53.640
What is the earth

00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:55.640
as spoken of in God's word?

00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:57.640
To what ruining of it,

00:33:57.640 --> 00:33:59.640
does Revelation 11 and 18 refer?

00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:03.640
When will Jehovah act to stop it?

00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:05.640
And what is the earth

00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:07.640
that will endure forever?

00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:09.639
So to start,

00:34:09.639 --> 00:34:11.639
what is meant by earth?

00:34:11.639 --> 00:34:13.639
To answer that question,

00:34:13.639 --> 00:34:15.639
we'll look at the planet

00:34:15.639 --> 00:34:17.639
and the people.

00:34:17.639 --> 00:34:19.639
Why do we include the people?

00:34:19.639 --> 00:34:21.639
Because earth

00:34:21.639 --> 00:34:23.639
like some other expressions

00:34:23.639 --> 00:34:25.639
in God's word,

00:34:25.639 --> 00:34:27.639
has more than one basic meaning.

00:34:27.639 --> 00:34:29.639
Consider the word heaven.

00:34:29.639 --> 00:34:31.639
Heaven has the sense

00:34:31.639 --> 00:34:33.639
of that which is higher lofty,

00:34:33.639 --> 00:34:35.639
and it can refer to a number of things.

00:34:35.639 --> 00:34:37.639
For example,

00:34:37.639 --> 00:34:39.639
at Genesis 27, verse 28,

00:34:39.639 --> 00:34:41.639
we read of Isaac's blessing

00:34:41.639 --> 00:34:43.639
for Jacob.

00:34:43.639 --> 00:34:45.639
He told him in part,

00:34:45.639 --> 00:34:47.639
may the true God give you

00:34:47.639 --> 00:34:49.639
the do's of the heavens.

00:34:49.639 --> 00:34:51.639
The do's of the heavens.

00:34:51.639 --> 00:34:53.639
Here, heavens has the meaning

00:34:53.639 --> 00:34:55.639
of literal sky.

00:34:55.639 --> 00:34:57.639
True?

00:34:57.639 --> 00:34:59.639
But now compare Daniel chapter 4 and verse 26.

00:34:59.639 --> 00:35:01.639
In this verse,

00:35:01.639 --> 00:35:03.639
we read that Daniel interprets

00:35:03.639 --> 00:35:05.639
Nebuchadnezzar's dream

00:35:05.639 --> 00:35:07.639
regarding the great tree,

00:35:07.639 --> 00:35:09.639
and he says to him,

00:35:09.639 --> 00:35:11.639
your kingdom will be yours again,

00:35:11.639 --> 00:35:13.639
after you come to know

00:35:13.639 --> 00:35:15.639
that the heavens are ruling.

00:35:15.639 --> 00:35:17.639
Clearly,

00:35:17.639 --> 00:35:19.639
this is not the literal sky, is it?

00:35:19.639 --> 00:35:21.639
But it has reference

00:35:21.639 --> 00:35:23.639
to Jehovah's sovereignty.

00:35:23.639 --> 00:35:25.639
Likewise,

00:35:25.639 --> 00:35:27.639
in the Bible, the word earth

00:35:27.639 --> 00:35:29.639
can have more than one meaning.

00:35:29.639 --> 00:35:31.639
First,

00:35:31.639 --> 00:35:33.639
let's look at the planet.

00:35:33.639 --> 00:35:35.639
Unlike the planets

00:35:35.639 --> 00:35:37.639
that have been named

00:35:37.639 --> 00:35:39.639
after false gods,

00:35:39.639 --> 00:35:41.639
Genesis chapter 1 tells us

00:35:41.639 --> 00:35:43.639
that Jehovah named this planet Earth.

00:35:43.639 --> 00:35:45.639
As for the false labeling

00:35:45.639 --> 00:35:47.639
of the other planets,

00:35:47.639 --> 00:35:49.639
we can be certain that those

00:35:49.639 --> 00:35:51.639
disgusting names will soon be gone.

00:35:51.639 --> 00:35:53.639
But as for the earth,

00:35:53.639 --> 00:35:55.639
Jehovah leaves us in no doubt

00:35:55.639 --> 00:35:57.639
about its future.

00:35:57.639 --> 00:35:59.639
It was created

00:35:59.639 --> 00:36:01.639
to last forever.

00:36:01.639 --> 00:36:03.639
Ecclesiastes chapter 1 and verse 4 states

00:36:03.639 --> 00:36:05.639
that although generations

00:36:05.639 --> 00:36:07.639
of people at this time

00:36:07.639 --> 00:36:09.639
come and go,

00:36:09.639 --> 00:36:11.639
the earth it says that is the planet

00:36:11.639 --> 00:36:13.639
remains forever.

00:36:13.639 --> 00:36:15.639
Psalm 104 verse 5 adds

00:36:15.639 --> 00:36:17.639
that it will not be moved from its place

00:36:17.639 --> 00:36:19.639
forever and ever.

00:36:19.639 --> 00:36:21.639
So then the planet earth

00:36:21.639 --> 00:36:23.639
will never be destroyed.

00:36:23.639 --> 00:36:25.639
God's purpose for it

00:36:25.639 --> 00:36:27.639
will be fulfilled.

00:36:27.639 --> 00:36:29.639
What is that purpose?

00:36:29.639 --> 00:36:31.639
God's purpose

00:36:31.639 --> 00:36:33.639
is for the earth to be inhabited

00:36:33.639 --> 00:36:35.639
by faithful humans

00:36:35.639 --> 00:36:37.639
in perfection

00:36:37.639 --> 00:36:39.639
and happiness

00:36:39.639 --> 00:36:41.639
with everlasting life.

00:36:41.639 --> 00:36:43.639
That brings us to the people

00:36:43.639 --> 00:36:45.639
those for whom the earth

00:36:45.639 --> 00:36:47.639
was made.

00:36:47.639 --> 00:36:49.639
You can hardly mention one

00:36:49.639 --> 00:36:51.639
without the other, right?

00:36:51.639 --> 00:36:53.639
For instance, many scriptures

00:36:53.639 --> 00:36:55.639
refer to people when speaking

00:36:55.639 --> 00:36:57.639
of the earth.

00:36:57.639 --> 00:36:59.639
Here are some examples.

00:36:59.639 --> 00:37:01.639
Genesis 111.

00:37:01.639 --> 00:37:03.639
Now all the earth

00:37:03.639 --> 00:37:05.639
continued to be of one language.

00:37:05.639 --> 00:37:07.639
At Genesis 24 and verse 3,

00:37:07.639 --> 00:37:09.639
Abraham refers to Jehovah

00:37:09.639 --> 00:37:11.639
the God of the earth,

00:37:11.639 --> 00:37:13.639
obviously people.

00:37:13.639 --> 00:37:15.639
Isaiah 4913,

00:37:15.639 --> 00:37:17.639
shout for joy,

00:37:17.639 --> 00:37:19.639
you heavens, and rejoice

00:37:19.639 --> 00:37:21.639
you earth.

00:37:21.639 --> 00:37:23.639
And Revelation 192 speaks

00:37:23.639 --> 00:37:25.639
of false religion

00:37:25.639 --> 00:37:27.639
as the great prostitute

00:37:27.639 --> 00:37:29.639
who corrupted the earth

00:37:29.639 --> 00:37:31.639
with her sexual immorality.

00:37:31.639 --> 00:37:33.639
Clearly, those verses

00:37:33.639 --> 00:37:35.639
refer to humans who can speak

00:37:35.639 --> 00:37:37.639
who can worship,

00:37:37.639 --> 00:37:39.639
and who can be corrupted

00:37:39.639 --> 00:37:41.639
by sexual immorality.

00:37:41.639 --> 00:37:43.639
Up to this point,

00:37:43.639 --> 00:37:45.639
we've looked at the earth

00:37:45.639 --> 00:37:47.639
then as a planet.

00:37:47.639 --> 00:37:49.639
We have reviewed God's purpose

00:37:49.639 --> 00:37:51.639
for it, and we have considered

00:37:51.639 --> 00:37:53.639
how the word earth

00:37:53.639 --> 00:37:55.639
relates to the people on it.

00:37:55.639 --> 00:37:57.639
Now let's consider the question

00:37:57.639 --> 00:37:59.639
to what ruining

00:37:59.639 --> 00:38:03.639
does Revelation 1118 refer

00:38:03.639 --> 00:38:05.639
to the planet,

00:38:05.639 --> 00:38:07.639
the people, or both?

00:38:07.639 --> 00:38:09.639
First, the planet.

00:38:09.639 --> 00:38:11.639
Jehovah hates to see the earth

00:38:11.639 --> 00:38:13.639
being ruined today as it is,

00:38:13.639 --> 00:38:15.639
and we can be certain

00:38:15.639 --> 00:38:17.639
that he hates the pollution,

00:38:17.639 --> 00:38:19.639
the damage to the earth's climate,

00:38:19.639 --> 00:38:21.639
the misuse of its resources,

00:38:21.639 --> 00:38:23.639
and the devastation

00:38:23.639 --> 00:38:25.639
of human wars.

00:38:25.639 --> 00:38:27.639
Jehovah cares for what he has made.

00:38:27.639 --> 00:38:29.639
After making the earth,

00:38:29.639 --> 00:38:31.639
he said that it was good.

00:38:31.639 --> 00:38:33.639
We can read about it.

00:38:33.639 --> 00:38:35.639
In chapter 1 and 2,

00:38:35.639 --> 00:38:37.639
imagine Jehovah's happiness.

00:38:37.639 --> 00:38:39.639
This special planet

00:38:39.639 --> 00:38:41.639
was to be a gift.

00:38:41.639 --> 00:38:45.639
Psalm 115 and verse 16 states

00:38:45.639 --> 00:38:47.639
that the earth he has given

00:38:47.639 --> 00:38:49.639
to the sons of men.

00:38:49.639 --> 00:38:51.639
So then, what about the people?

00:38:51.639 --> 00:38:53.639
Does Jehovah's discuss

00:38:53.639 --> 00:38:55.639
that the ruining of the earth

00:38:55.639 --> 00:38:57.639
apply to the ruining

00:38:57.639 --> 00:38:59.639
of mankind as well?

00:38:59.639 --> 00:39:01.639
Yes.

00:39:01.639 --> 00:39:03.639
We can see this in what is stated

00:39:03.639 --> 00:39:07.639
at Genesis chapter 6 and verses 11 and 12.

00:39:07.639 --> 00:39:09.639
In this setting,

00:39:09.639 --> 00:39:11.639
the world of Noah's day

00:39:11.639 --> 00:39:13.639
has become ruined in God's eyes.

00:39:13.639 --> 00:39:15.639
And as we read the verses,

00:39:15.639 --> 00:39:17.639
look for the connection

00:39:17.639 --> 00:39:19.639
between the earth

00:39:19.639 --> 00:39:21.639
and mankind.

00:39:21.639 --> 00:39:25.639
It says, Genesis 6 starting in verse 11,

00:39:25.639 --> 00:39:27.639
but the earth had become ruined

00:39:27.639 --> 00:39:29.639
in the sight of the true God,

00:39:29.639 --> 00:39:31.639
and the earth was filled

00:39:31.639 --> 00:39:33.639
with violence.

00:39:33.639 --> 00:39:35.639
Yes, God looked upon the earth

00:39:35.639 --> 00:39:37.639
and it was ruined.

00:39:37.639 --> 00:39:41.639
All flesh had ruined its way

00:39:41.639 --> 00:39:43.639
on the earth.

00:39:43.639 --> 00:39:45.639
Do you see the connection?

00:39:45.639 --> 00:39:47.639
Rather than speaking of just the planet,

00:39:47.639 --> 00:39:49.639
the scriptures here linked the ruining

00:39:49.639 --> 00:39:51.639
of all flesh or people

00:39:51.639 --> 00:39:55.639
with the ruining of the earth.

00:39:55.639 --> 00:39:57.639
Likewise, today,

00:39:57.639 --> 00:40:01.639
just as mankind is harming the actual planet,

00:40:01.639 --> 00:40:03.639
the world under Satan's control

00:40:03.639 --> 00:40:05.639
is also ruining all flesh.

00:40:05.639 --> 00:40:07.639
In both ways,

00:40:07.639 --> 00:40:09.639
the earth is being ruined.

00:40:09.639 --> 00:40:11.639
How so?

00:40:11.639 --> 00:40:13.639
Along with false religion,

00:40:13.639 --> 00:40:15.639
human society in general

00:40:15.639 --> 00:40:17.639
is gradually corrupting

00:40:17.639 --> 00:40:19.639
everything that Jehovah

00:40:19.639 --> 00:40:21.639
has said in place for mankind.

00:40:21.639 --> 00:40:23.639
We see it in their

00:40:23.639 --> 00:40:25.639
incessant nationalistic wars.

00:40:25.639 --> 00:40:27.639
We see it in their racial

00:40:27.639 --> 00:40:29.639
hatred and divisiveness.

00:40:29.639 --> 00:40:31.639
We see it in their promoting

00:40:31.639 --> 00:40:33.639
of abortion.

00:40:33.639 --> 00:40:35.639
We see it in their so-called

00:40:35.639 --> 00:40:37.639
gay marriage.

00:40:37.639 --> 00:40:39.639
We see it in the gender blurring

00:40:39.639 --> 00:40:41.639
that the world is promoting.

00:40:41.639 --> 00:40:43.639
You don't have to be a man

00:40:43.639 --> 00:40:45.639
or a woman they say.

00:40:45.639 --> 00:40:47.639
You can be whatever you feel like

00:40:47.639 --> 00:40:49.639
or choose to be.

00:40:49.639 --> 00:40:51.639
Really?

00:40:51.639 --> 00:40:53.639
What does Jehovah say about that?

00:40:53.639 --> 00:40:55.639
In the Utteronomy chapter 22 and verse 5,

00:40:55.639 --> 00:40:57.639
he told the nation of Israel

00:40:57.639 --> 00:40:59.639
that, quote,

00:40:59.639 --> 00:41:01.639
a woman must not put on

00:41:01.639 --> 00:41:03.639
the clothing of a man.

00:41:03.639 --> 00:41:04.639
Nor should a man

00:41:04.639 --> 00:41:05.639
wear the clothing of a woman.

00:41:05.639 --> 00:41:07.639
For anyone doing so

00:41:07.639 --> 00:41:09.639
is detestable

00:41:09.639 --> 00:41:11.639
to Jehovah your God.

00:41:11.639 --> 00:41:13.639
If that is how the creator

00:41:13.639 --> 00:41:15.639
feels about the switching

00:41:15.639 --> 00:41:17.639
of clothing,

00:41:17.639 --> 00:41:19.639
how much more detestable

00:41:19.639 --> 00:41:21.639
he must view the world's attempts

00:41:21.639 --> 00:41:23.639
to blur the lines of gender

00:41:23.639 --> 00:41:25.639
with false labeling.

00:41:25.639 --> 00:41:27.639
Recently,

00:41:27.639 --> 00:41:29.639
the World Health Organization

00:41:29.639 --> 00:41:31.639
adjusted its view of gender.

00:41:31.639 --> 00:41:33.639
It now states that, quote,

00:41:33.639 --> 00:41:35.639
there are many genders

00:41:35.639 --> 00:41:37.639
existing on a spectrum

00:41:37.639 --> 00:41:39.639
from male to female.

00:41:39.639 --> 00:41:41.639
It added

00:41:41.639 --> 00:41:43.639
that gender identity

00:41:43.639 --> 00:41:45.639
exists on a continuum

00:41:45.639 --> 00:41:47.639
and that sex is not limited

00:41:47.639 --> 00:41:49.639
to male or female.

00:41:49.639 --> 00:41:51.639
Again, really?

00:41:51.639 --> 00:41:53.639
Talk about an attempt

00:41:53.639 --> 00:41:55.639
to tear apart what Jehovah has made.

00:41:55.639 --> 00:41:57.639
So then, even government agencies

00:41:57.639 --> 00:41:59.639
on a global scale

00:41:59.639 --> 00:42:01.639
are getting involved.

00:42:01.639 --> 00:42:03.639
And they are critical of anyone

00:42:03.639 --> 00:42:05.639
who does not adopt

00:42:05.639 --> 00:42:07.639
their warped view.

00:42:07.639 --> 00:42:09.639
At Proverbs 19, verse 3,

00:42:09.639 --> 00:42:11.639
it explains,

00:42:11.639 --> 00:42:13.639
it is a man's own foolishness

00:42:13.639 --> 00:42:15.639
that distorts his way

00:42:15.639 --> 00:42:17.639
and his heart becomes

00:42:17.639 --> 00:42:19.639
outraged against Jehovah.

00:42:19.639 --> 00:42:21.639
And going back to marriage,

00:42:21.639 --> 00:42:23.639
Jehovah instituted the arrangement

00:42:23.639 --> 00:42:25.639
to be a permanent bond

00:42:25.639 --> 00:42:27.639
between a man

00:42:27.639 --> 00:42:29.639
and a woman.

00:42:29.639 --> 00:42:31.639
At Matthew 19, verses 4 and 5,

00:42:31.639 --> 00:42:33.639
we read how Jesus

00:42:33.639 --> 00:42:35.639
emphasized this

00:42:35.639 --> 00:42:37.639
while he was on the earth.

00:42:37.639 --> 00:42:39.639
Quoting from Genesis 2.24,

00:42:39.639 --> 00:42:41.639
he said this,

00:42:41.639 --> 00:42:43.639
have you not read

00:42:43.639 --> 00:42:45.639
that the one who created them

00:42:45.639 --> 00:42:47.639
male and female

00:42:47.639 --> 00:42:49.639
and said, for this reason

00:42:49.639 --> 00:42:51.639
a man will leave his father

00:42:51.639 --> 00:42:53.639
and his mother

00:42:53.639 --> 00:42:55.639
and will stick to his wife

00:42:55.639 --> 00:42:57.639
and the two will be one flesh?

00:42:57.639 --> 00:42:59.639
He made them male

00:42:59.639 --> 00:43:01.639
and female

00:43:01.639 --> 00:43:05.639
and the two will be one flesh.

00:43:05.639 --> 00:43:07.639
Jehovah's purpose

00:43:07.639 --> 00:43:09.639
for humans is clear.

00:43:09.639 --> 00:43:11.639
But Satan's world now says

00:43:11.639 --> 00:43:13.639
that marriage can be between two men

00:43:13.639 --> 00:43:15.639
or two women.

00:43:15.639 --> 00:43:17.639
Again, really?

00:43:17.639 --> 00:43:19.639
We can be certain

00:43:19.639 --> 00:43:21.639
that promoting this corrupt view

00:43:21.639 --> 00:43:23.639
is Satan's attempts

00:43:23.639 --> 00:43:25.639
part of Satan's attempt

00:43:25.639 --> 00:43:27.639
to ruin mankind,

00:43:27.639 --> 00:43:29.639
to make them so abhorrent to Jehovah

00:43:29.639 --> 00:43:31.639
that he would abandon humans

00:43:31.639 --> 00:43:33.639
and his purpose

00:43:33.639 --> 00:43:35.639
for mankind in the earth.

00:43:35.639 --> 00:43:37.639
But that will never happen.

00:43:37.639 --> 00:43:39.639
God's purpose

00:43:39.639 --> 00:43:41.639
for mankind and their home

00:43:41.639 --> 00:43:43.639
will be fulfilled.

00:43:43.639 --> 00:43:45.639
Just like the disgusting names

00:43:45.639 --> 00:43:47.639
of the false gods

00:43:47.639 --> 00:43:49.639
that humans have given

00:43:49.639 --> 00:43:51.639
to the literal planets,

00:43:51.639 --> 00:43:53.639
the false labeling

00:43:53.639 --> 00:43:55.639
of humankind

00:43:55.639 --> 00:43:57.639
and the immorality

00:43:57.639 --> 00:43:59.639
will not continue.

00:43:59.639 --> 00:44:01.639
For his own namesake

00:44:01.639 --> 00:44:03.639
and for those who love him,

00:44:03.639 --> 00:44:05.639
Jehovah will bring to ruin

00:44:05.639 --> 00:44:07.639
those ruining the earth.

00:44:07.639 --> 00:44:09.639
Well, it's one thing

00:44:09.639 --> 00:44:11.639
such matters among ourselves.

00:44:11.639 --> 00:44:13.639
But what are we doing to help other people?

00:44:13.639 --> 00:44:15.639
What are we doing to build

00:44:15.639 --> 00:44:17.639
respect for Jehovah's view

00:44:17.639 --> 00:44:19.639
of the earth?

00:44:19.639 --> 00:44:21.639
Jehovah's view of humankind.

00:44:21.639 --> 00:44:23.639
And Jehovah's purpose

00:44:23.639 --> 00:44:25.639
for their future.

00:44:25.639 --> 00:44:27.639
Well, with a clear conscience,

00:44:27.639 --> 00:44:29.639
we can confidently say

00:44:29.639 --> 00:44:31.639
that we've not held back

00:44:31.639 --> 00:44:33.639
in speaking the truth about such matters.

00:44:33.639 --> 00:44:35.639
For example,

00:44:35.639 --> 00:44:37.639
here are some of the articles

00:44:37.639 --> 00:44:39.639
that honest-hearted ones can read.

00:44:39.639 --> 00:44:41.639
For instance,

00:44:41.639 --> 00:44:43.639
what does the Bible say about abortion?

00:44:43.639 --> 00:44:45.639
Does the Bible comment

00:44:45.639 --> 00:44:49.639
on same-sex marriages?

00:44:49.639 --> 00:44:51.639
And how can I explain

00:44:51.639 --> 00:44:53.639
the Bible's view

00:44:53.639 --> 00:44:55.639
of homosexuality?

00:44:55.639 --> 00:44:57.639
We should be happy

00:44:57.639 --> 00:44:59.639
to have such tools

00:44:59.639 --> 00:45:01.639
to help other people.

00:45:01.639 --> 00:45:03.639
So then, what is more important

00:45:03.639 --> 00:45:05.639
to Jehovah, the literal planet

00:45:05.639 --> 00:45:07.639
that people

00:45:07.639 --> 00:45:09.639
both are highly valued

00:45:09.639 --> 00:45:11.639
and that is why both

00:45:11.639 --> 00:45:13.639
will endure forever.

00:45:13.639 --> 00:45:15.639
But the people of the earth

00:45:15.639 --> 00:45:17.639
are far more important.

00:45:17.639 --> 00:45:19.639
Jehovah gave his son

00:45:19.639 --> 00:45:21.639
as a ransom for mankind,

00:45:21.639 --> 00:45:23.639
not for a planet.

00:45:23.639 --> 00:45:25.639
John 3.16 says

00:45:25.639 --> 00:45:27.639
that God loved the world so much

00:45:27.639 --> 00:45:29.639
that he gave his only begotten son

00:45:29.639 --> 00:45:31.639
so that everyone

00:45:31.639 --> 00:45:33.639
exercising faith in him

00:45:33.639 --> 00:45:35.639
might not be destroyed,

00:45:35.639 --> 00:45:37.639
destroyed, but have ever

00:45:37.639 --> 00:45:39.639
lasting life.

00:45:39.639 --> 00:45:41.639
And of Jesus,

00:45:41.639 --> 00:45:43.639
God's master worker,

00:45:43.639 --> 00:45:45.639
Proverbs 8 and verse 31,

00:45:45.639 --> 00:45:47.639
quotes him as saying,

00:45:47.639 --> 00:45:49.639
I rejoiced over his habitable earth

00:45:49.639 --> 00:45:51.639
and I was especially fond

00:45:51.639 --> 00:45:55.639
of the sons of men.

00:45:55.639 --> 00:45:57.639
Knowing this,

00:45:57.639 --> 00:45:59.639
what should we continue to do?

00:45:59.639 --> 00:46:01.639
What we should kindly

00:46:01.639 --> 00:46:03.639
and respectfully help others

00:46:03.639 --> 00:46:05.639
to see Jehovah's view

00:46:05.639 --> 00:46:07.639
while there is still time?

00:46:07.639 --> 00:46:09.639
We must never become ashamed

00:46:09.639 --> 00:46:11.639
of the good news.

00:46:11.639 --> 00:46:13.639
For it's not just good news about

00:46:13.639 --> 00:46:15.639
paradise, it's also good news

00:46:15.639 --> 00:46:17.639
about Jehovah's time to

00:46:17.639 --> 00:46:19.639
set things right on earth again.

00:46:19.639 --> 00:46:21.639
Parents with young children

00:46:21.639 --> 00:46:23.639
should take courage

00:46:23.639 --> 00:46:25.639
from this fact

00:46:25.639 --> 00:46:27.639
as they work hard to protect their children

00:46:27.639 --> 00:46:29.639
from Satan's attempts

00:46:29.639 --> 00:46:31.639
to ruin their minds and hearts

00:46:31.639 --> 00:46:33.639
with immoral thoughts

00:46:33.639 --> 00:46:35.639
and false reasoning.

00:46:35.639 --> 00:46:37.639
Thankfully, the end

00:46:37.639 --> 00:46:39.639
is coming quickly.

00:46:39.639 --> 00:46:41.639
Please notice what is said

00:46:41.639 --> 00:46:43.639
at Revelation chapter 14

00:46:43.639 --> 00:46:45.639
and verses 6 and 7.

00:46:45.639 --> 00:46:47.639
And as we read it,

00:46:47.639 --> 00:46:49.639
look for what an angel

00:46:49.639 --> 00:46:51.639
includes in the good news

00:46:51.639 --> 00:46:53.639
that he declares.

00:46:53.639 --> 00:46:55.639
It says, in part,

00:46:55.639 --> 00:46:57.639
Revelation chapter 14

00:46:57.639 --> 00:47:01.639
verses 6 and 7.

00:47:01.639 --> 00:47:03.639
It says he had ever

00:47:03.639 --> 00:47:05.639
lasting good news to declare

00:47:05.639 --> 00:47:07.639
to those who dwell on the earth

00:47:07.639 --> 00:47:09.639
to every nation

00:47:09.639 --> 00:47:11.639
and tribe and tongue in people.

00:47:11.639 --> 00:47:13.639
He was saying in a loud voice,

00:47:13.639 --> 00:47:15.639
fear God

00:47:15.639 --> 00:47:17.639
and give him glory

00:47:17.639 --> 00:47:19.639
because the hour of judgment

00:47:19.639 --> 00:47:21.639
by him has arrived.

00:47:21.639 --> 00:47:23.639
So worship the one who made the heaven

00:47:23.639 --> 00:47:25.639
and the earth

00:47:25.639 --> 00:47:29.639
to see and the springs of water.

00:47:29.639 --> 00:47:31.639
So then,

00:47:31.639 --> 00:47:33.639
what does the angel include

00:47:33.639 --> 00:47:35.639
in his message

00:47:35.639 --> 00:47:37.639
in his good news

00:47:37.639 --> 00:47:39.639
that he is declaring?

00:47:39.639 --> 00:47:41.639
Fear God, he said,

00:47:41.639 --> 00:47:43.639
and give him glory

00:47:43.639 --> 00:47:45.639
because the hour of judgment

00:47:45.639 --> 00:47:47.639
by him has arrived.

00:47:47.639 --> 00:47:49.639
For those who love what is right

00:47:49.639 --> 00:47:51.639
that truly is good news.

00:47:51.639 --> 00:47:53.639
And we're happy to include

00:47:53.639 --> 00:47:55.639
an angelic message

00:47:55.639 --> 00:47:57.639
in what we share with other people.

00:47:57.639 --> 00:47:59.639
God's Word assures us

00:47:59.639 --> 00:48:03.639
at Acts chapter 17 and verse 31.

00:48:03.639 --> 00:48:05.639
That Jehovah has said a day

00:48:05.639 --> 00:48:07.639
on which he purposes

00:48:07.639 --> 00:48:09.639
to judge the inhabited earth

00:48:09.639 --> 00:48:11.639
and righteousness

00:48:11.639 --> 00:48:13.639
by means of his Son.

00:48:13.639 --> 00:48:15.639
What a relief

00:48:15.639 --> 00:48:17.639
and peace that will bring

00:48:17.639 --> 00:48:19.639
to those who want to please Jehovah.

00:48:19.639 --> 00:48:21.639
Well, in this talk,

00:48:21.639 --> 00:48:23.639
we have examined what is meant

00:48:23.639 --> 00:48:25.639
when the Bible speaks of the earth.

00:48:25.639 --> 00:48:27.639
That is the planet

00:48:27.639 --> 00:48:29.639
and the people

00:48:29.639 --> 00:48:31.639
for whom it was made.

00:48:31.639 --> 00:48:33.639
We have also considered

00:48:33.639 --> 00:48:35.639
the fact that the earth

00:48:35.639 --> 00:48:37.639
is being ruined in more ways

00:48:37.639 --> 00:48:39.639
than just the corrupting

00:48:39.639 --> 00:48:41.639
of its environment

00:48:41.639 --> 00:48:43.639
and the misuse of its resources.

00:48:43.639 --> 00:48:45.639
It goes far beyond that, doesn't it?

00:48:45.639 --> 00:48:47.639
Satan and his world

00:48:47.639 --> 00:48:49.639
are also attempting

00:48:49.639 --> 00:48:51.639
to control this human creation

00:48:51.639 --> 00:48:53.639
in every way possible.

00:48:53.639 --> 00:48:55.639
But they will fail.

00:48:55.639 --> 00:48:57.639
Since Jehovah gave his Son

00:48:57.639 --> 00:48:59.639
to save faithful humans

00:48:59.639 --> 00:49:01.639
and to restore his purpose,

00:49:01.639 --> 00:49:03.639
our next question is

00:49:03.639 --> 00:49:05.639
when will it happen?

00:49:05.639 --> 00:49:07.639
When will Jehovah bring to ruin

00:49:07.639 --> 00:49:09.639
those ruining the earth?

00:49:09.639 --> 00:49:11.639
Well, the answer to that question is soon.

00:49:11.639 --> 00:49:13.639
Very soon.

00:49:13.639 --> 00:49:15.639
The ruining of mankind

00:49:15.639 --> 00:49:17.639
and their home will not

00:49:17.639 --> 00:49:19.639
be allowed to go on.

00:49:19.639 --> 00:49:21.639
Let no one be mistaken about it.

00:49:21.639 --> 00:49:23.639
Jehovah is resolved.

00:49:23.639 --> 00:49:25.639
He is patient.

00:49:25.639 --> 00:49:27.639
He does not desire any

00:49:27.639 --> 00:49:29.639
to be destroyed.

00:49:29.639 --> 00:49:31.639
But he is determined.

00:49:31.639 --> 00:49:33.639
His day is coming.

00:49:33.639 --> 00:49:35.639
Second Peter 313 assures us

00:49:35.639 --> 00:49:37.639
that there are new heavens

00:49:37.639 --> 00:49:39.639
and a new earth that we are awaiting

00:49:39.639 --> 00:49:41.639
according to his promise.

00:49:41.639 --> 00:49:43.639
That promised new earth

00:49:43.639 --> 00:49:45.639
is a new human society

00:49:45.639 --> 00:49:47.639
that will worship

00:49:47.639 --> 00:49:49.639
and serve the only true God

00:49:49.639 --> 00:49:51.639
forever.

00:49:51.639 --> 00:49:53.639
Those who persist

00:49:53.639 --> 00:49:55.639
in ruining the earth

00:49:55.639 --> 00:49:57.639
will not be a part of it.

00:49:57.639 --> 00:49:59.639
At Matthew 19, verse 28,

00:49:59.639 --> 00:50:03.639
Jesus speaks of this coming change

00:50:03.639 --> 00:50:07.639
as a time of recreation.

00:50:07.639 --> 00:50:09.639
The study note for that verse

00:50:09.639 --> 00:50:11.639
says that recreation means

00:50:11.639 --> 00:50:15.639
regeneration or renewal.

00:50:15.639 --> 00:50:19.639
It then adds that the recreation is

00:50:19.639 --> 00:50:21.639
the time when the rule of Christ

00:50:21.639 --> 00:50:23.639
and his co-rulers

00:50:23.639 --> 00:50:25.639
will bring to the earth

00:50:25.639 --> 00:50:27.639
a renewal of the perfect conditions

00:50:27.639 --> 00:50:29.639
enjoyed by the first humans

00:50:29.639 --> 00:50:31.639
before they sinned.

00:50:31.639 --> 00:50:33.639
That's wonderful

00:50:33.639 --> 00:50:35.639
to think about.

00:50:35.639 --> 00:50:37.639
The recreation will set things

00:50:37.639 --> 00:50:39.639
straight after a failed rebellion.

00:50:39.639 --> 00:50:41.639
It will fulfill

00:50:41.639 --> 00:50:43.639
Jehovah's purpose

00:50:43.639 --> 00:50:45.639
for the earth.

00:50:45.639 --> 00:50:47.639
So then what is the earth

00:50:47.639 --> 00:50:49.639
that is being ruined today?

00:50:49.639 --> 00:50:51.639
As we have discussed

00:50:51.639 --> 00:50:53.639
it is the planet

00:50:53.639 --> 00:50:55.639
and the people being corrupted

00:50:55.639 --> 00:50:57.639
by Satan's world.

00:50:57.639 --> 00:50:59.639
But what is the earth

00:50:59.639 --> 00:51:01.639
that will endure forever?

00:51:01.639 --> 00:51:03.639
First, the planet.

00:51:03.639 --> 00:51:05.639
As we have read,

00:51:05.639 --> 00:51:07.639
the scriptures are clear

00:51:07.639 --> 00:51:08.639
that it will last forever.

00:51:08.639 --> 00:51:10.639
Next and most important,

00:51:10.639 --> 00:51:12.639
the people.

00:51:12.639 --> 00:51:14.639
The new earth.

00:51:14.639 --> 00:51:16.639
Those for whom Jesus died

00:51:16.639 --> 00:51:18.639
and who respond to the good news.

00:51:18.639 --> 00:51:20.639
The recreation is coming.

00:51:20.639 --> 00:51:22.639
Jesus will not waste

00:51:22.639 --> 00:51:26.639
a single day of the thousand years.

00:51:26.639 --> 00:51:28.639
Not one day of it.

00:51:28.639 --> 00:51:30.639
He is determined to honor

00:51:30.639 --> 00:51:32.639
Jehovah and accomplish

00:51:32.639 --> 00:51:34.639
his purpose for the earth.

00:51:34.639 --> 00:51:37.949
The future is not complicated.

00:51:37.949 --> 00:51:39.949
Jehovah's purpose

00:51:39.949 --> 00:51:41.949
is not hard to understand.

00:51:41.949 --> 00:51:43.949
The coming time

00:51:43.949 --> 00:51:45.949
of recreation will bring about

00:51:45.949 --> 00:51:47.949
a rejuvenated earth,

00:51:47.949 --> 00:51:49.949
a rejuvenated planet

00:51:49.949 --> 00:51:51.949
filled with perfect people

00:51:51.949 --> 00:51:53.949
who love and serve

00:51:53.949 --> 00:51:55.949
Jehovah together.

00:51:55.949 --> 00:51:57.949
That is the earth

00:51:57.949 --> 00:51:59.949
that will endure forever.

00:51:59.949 --> 00:52:06.909
We appreciate

00:52:06.909 --> 00:52:08.909
that encouragement very much.

00:52:08.909 --> 00:52:10.909
Thank you, Ken.

00:52:10.909 --> 00:52:12.909
Another positive note.

00:52:12.909 --> 00:52:14.909
Let's listen as our brother Mark Sanderson

00:52:14.909 --> 00:52:16.909
speaks to us on the subject.

00:52:16.909 --> 00:52:18.909
Share it with the generation

00:52:18.909 --> 00:52:20.909
to come.

00:52:20.909 --> 00:52:24.219
Mark, please.

00:52:24.219 --> 00:52:26.219
At Matthew 13, verse 52,

00:52:26.219 --> 00:52:28.219
Jesus said that every

00:52:28.219 --> 00:52:30.219
public instructor

00:52:30.219 --> 00:52:32.219
was like a man with a treasure store

00:52:32.219 --> 00:52:34.219
filled with truths

00:52:34.219 --> 00:52:36.219
old and new.

00:52:36.219 --> 00:52:38.219
Well, we know that's true.

00:52:38.219 --> 00:52:40.219
And if it's true,

00:52:40.219 --> 00:52:42.219
it means that

00:52:42.219 --> 00:52:44.219
this audience

00:52:44.219 --> 00:52:46.219
are among the most rich people

00:52:46.219 --> 00:52:48.219
in the entire world.

00:52:48.219 --> 00:52:50.219
You have a large

00:52:50.219 --> 00:52:52.219
treasure store of truths

00:52:52.219 --> 00:52:54.219
both old

00:52:54.219 --> 00:52:56.219
and new.

00:52:56.219 --> 00:52:58.219
But here's the question.

00:52:58.219 --> 00:53:00.219
What will you do

00:53:00.219 --> 00:53:02.219
with your treasure store?

00:53:02.219 --> 00:53:04.219
Now, a Deuteronomy,

00:53:04.219 --> 00:53:06.219
chapter 29,

00:53:06.219 --> 00:53:10.400
and verse 29,

00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:12.400
he said,

00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:14.400
the things concealed

00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:16.400
belong to Jehovah our God.

00:53:16.400 --> 00:53:18.400
But the things revealed

00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:20.400
belong to us

00:53:20.400 --> 00:53:22.400
and

00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:24.400
and

00:53:24.400 --> 00:53:26.400
to our descendants

00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:28.400
forever

00:53:28.400 --> 00:53:30.400
so that we may carry out

00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:32.400
all the words

00:53:32.400 --> 00:53:34.400
of this law.

00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:36.400
Well, there's a

00:53:36.400 --> 00:53:38.400
fundamental truth there.

00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:40.400
We belong to us.

00:53:40.400 --> 00:53:42.400
But rather, it also

00:53:42.400 --> 00:53:44.400
belongs to our descendants

00:53:44.400 --> 00:53:46.400
to all of our

00:53:46.400 --> 00:53:48.400
sons and daughters who

00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:50.400
are to come.

00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:52.400
Well, that means that as men

00:53:52.400 --> 00:53:54.400
and women of faith,

00:53:54.400 --> 00:53:56.400
we have a clear

00:53:56.400 --> 00:53:58.400
responsibility

00:53:58.400 --> 00:54:00.400
to share, to pass on

00:54:00.400 --> 00:54:02.400
the wonderful truths

00:54:02.400 --> 00:54:04.400
that we have come to know

00:54:04.400 --> 00:54:06.400
with the next generation.

00:54:06.400 --> 00:54:07.400
Well, the Bible emphasizes this.

00:54:07.400 --> 00:54:09.400
Let's read

00:54:09.400 --> 00:54:11.400
that what the Psalmist said

00:54:11.400 --> 00:54:13.400
in Psalm 78

00:54:13.400 --> 00:54:16.739
and verse 3,

00:54:16.739 --> 00:54:18.739
Psalm 78,

00:54:18.739 --> 00:54:20.739
verse 3,

00:54:20.739 --> 00:54:22.739
it says,

00:54:22.739 --> 00:54:24.739
the things we have heard

00:54:24.739 --> 00:54:26.739
and know which our fathers

00:54:26.739 --> 00:54:28.739
have related to us,

00:54:28.739 --> 00:54:30.739
we will not hide

00:54:30.739 --> 00:54:32.739
from their sons.

00:54:32.739 --> 00:54:34.739
We will relate to the generation

00:54:34.739 --> 00:54:36.739
to come the praiseworthy deeds

00:54:36.739 --> 00:54:38.739
and the wonderful things

00:54:38.739 --> 00:54:40.739
that He has done.

00:54:40.739 --> 00:54:42.739
Well, now,

00:54:42.739 --> 00:54:44.739
this includes more

00:54:44.739 --> 00:54:46.739
than just the basic truths.

00:54:46.739 --> 00:54:48.739
It also includes all

00:54:48.739 --> 00:54:50.739
of the wonderful things

00:54:50.739 --> 00:54:52.739
that we've been taught

00:54:52.739 --> 00:54:54.739
by other brothers and sisters.

00:54:54.739 --> 00:54:56.739
All the experiences

00:54:56.739 --> 00:54:58.739
that we've had

00:54:58.739 --> 00:55:00.739
in experiencing the hand

00:55:00.739 --> 00:55:02.739
of Jehovah in our own lives.

00:55:02.739 --> 00:55:04.739
Well, Jehovah took the matter

00:55:04.739 --> 00:55:06.739
of passing this on

00:55:06.739 --> 00:55:08.739
to the next generation

00:55:08.739 --> 00:55:10.739
very seriously,

00:55:10.739 --> 00:55:12.739
because look at what it says in verse 5.

00:55:12.739 --> 00:55:14.739
It says,

00:55:14.739 --> 00:55:16.739
he established a reminder

00:55:16.739 --> 00:55:18.739
in Jacob

00:55:18.739 --> 00:55:20.739
and set a law

00:55:20.739 --> 00:55:22.739
in Israel.

00:55:22.739 --> 00:55:24.739
He commanded our forefathers

00:55:24.739 --> 00:55:26.739
to make these things known

00:55:26.739 --> 00:55:28.739
to their children

00:55:28.739 --> 00:55:30.739
so that the next generation

00:55:30.739 --> 00:55:32.739
the children yet to be

00:55:32.739 --> 00:55:34.739
they in turn would relate them

00:55:34.739 --> 00:55:36.739
to their children.

00:55:36.739 --> 00:55:38.739
Well, brothers and sisters,

00:55:38.739 --> 00:55:40.739
especially those of you

00:55:40.739 --> 00:55:42.739
who have so much wisdom

00:55:42.739 --> 00:55:44.739
and experience,

00:55:44.739 --> 00:55:46.739
do you feel

00:55:46.739 --> 00:55:48.739
that responsibility

00:55:48.739 --> 00:55:50.739
to share what you have

00:55:50.739 --> 00:55:52.739
with the generation to come?

00:55:52.739 --> 00:55:54.739
Well, if we get the sense

00:55:54.739 --> 00:55:56.739
of Deuteronomy 29-29

00:55:56.739 --> 00:55:58.739
and Psalm 78,

00:55:58.739 --> 00:56:00.739
well, then we will do this.

00:56:00.739 --> 00:56:02.739
We will share what we have

00:56:02.739 --> 00:56:04.739
with the next generation.

00:56:04.739 --> 00:56:06.739
But how do we do it?

00:56:06.739 --> 00:56:08.739
Well, of course, this process begins

00:56:08.739 --> 00:56:10.739
with all of our parents.

00:56:10.739 --> 00:56:12.739
And by their following

00:56:12.739 --> 00:56:14.739
the command in Deuteronomy 6,

00:56:14.739 --> 00:56:16.739
verses 6 and 7,

00:56:16.739 --> 00:56:18.739
to teach their children

00:56:18.739 --> 00:56:20.739
as they sit in the house,

00:56:20.739 --> 00:56:22.739
as they walk on the road

00:56:22.739 --> 00:56:24.739
when they lie down

00:56:24.739 --> 00:56:26.739
and when they get up.

00:56:26.739 --> 00:56:28.739
But the process

00:56:28.739 --> 00:56:30.739
does not end

00:56:30.739 --> 00:56:32.739
with the Christian parents.

00:56:32.739 --> 00:56:34.739
We also have a

00:56:34.739 --> 00:56:36.739
responsibility to teach

00:56:36.739 --> 00:56:38.739
and train young adults

00:56:38.739 --> 00:56:40.739
so that they can take

00:56:40.739 --> 00:56:42.739
on responsibility

00:56:42.739 --> 00:56:44.739
in Jehovah's congregation.

00:56:44.739 --> 00:56:46.739
Now, the Bible

00:56:46.739 --> 00:56:48.739
is filled with examples

00:56:48.739 --> 00:56:50.739
of individuals who are wonderful trainers.

00:56:50.739 --> 00:56:52.739
Maybe one who comes to mind

00:56:52.739 --> 00:56:54.739
right away is Moses.

00:56:54.739 --> 00:56:56.739
It seems that in the Bible

00:56:56.739 --> 00:56:58.739
wherever you see Moses,

00:56:58.739 --> 00:57:00.739
you see Joshua.

00:57:00.739 --> 00:57:02.739
They're always together.

00:57:02.739 --> 00:57:04.739
Can you imagine the wonderful training

00:57:04.739 --> 00:57:06.739
that Moses was able to impart

00:57:06.739 --> 00:57:08.739
to Joshua as they work

00:57:08.739 --> 00:57:10.739
together for more than 40 years?

00:57:10.739 --> 00:57:14.739
Moses not only told Joshua

00:57:14.739 --> 00:57:16.739
but he also showed him.

00:57:16.739 --> 00:57:18.739
And by being with him,

00:57:18.739 --> 00:57:20.739
he was able to observe

00:57:20.739 --> 00:57:22.739
his fine example.

00:57:22.739 --> 00:57:24.739
Well, when the time was ready,

00:57:24.739 --> 00:57:26.739
when Moses was ready

00:57:26.739 --> 00:57:28.739
to hand over the responsibility,

00:57:28.739 --> 00:57:30.739
notice what he says here

00:57:30.739 --> 00:57:32.739
in Deuteronomy chapter 31

00:57:32.739 --> 00:57:36.150
and verse 7.

00:57:36.150 --> 00:57:40.150
It says Moses then called Joshua

00:57:40.150 --> 00:57:42.150
and said to him before the eyes

00:57:42.150 --> 00:57:44.150
of all Israel,

00:57:44.150 --> 00:57:46.150
be courageous and strong

00:57:46.150 --> 00:57:48.150
for you are the one

00:57:48.150 --> 00:57:50.150
who will bring this people into the land

00:57:50.150 --> 00:57:52.150
that Jehovah swore to their forefathers

00:57:52.150 --> 00:57:54.150
to give to them

00:57:54.150 --> 00:57:56.150
and you will give it to them

00:57:56.150 --> 00:57:58.150
as an inheritance.

00:57:58.150 --> 00:58:00.150
Jehovah is the one marching

00:58:00.150 --> 00:58:02.150
before you and he will continue

00:58:02.150 --> 00:58:04.150
with you.

00:58:04.150 --> 00:58:06.150
He will neither desert you

00:58:06.150 --> 00:58:08.150
nor abandon you.

00:58:08.150 --> 00:58:10.150
Do not be afraid or be terrified.

00:58:10.150 --> 00:58:12.150
Well, can you imagine

00:58:12.150 --> 00:58:14.150
how Moses must have felt

00:58:14.150 --> 00:58:16.150
to say those words to this young man

00:58:16.150 --> 00:58:18.150
who he had worked so hard

00:58:18.150 --> 00:58:20.150
all of these years with?

00:58:20.150 --> 00:58:22.150
Well, that's not the only example

00:58:22.150 --> 00:58:24.150
that's in the scriptures.

00:58:24.150 --> 00:58:26.150
What about Paul and Timothy?

00:58:26.150 --> 00:58:28.150
We know that Timothy was

00:58:28.150 --> 00:58:30.150
probably in his late teens

00:58:30.150 --> 00:58:32.150
or early 20s

00:58:32.150 --> 00:58:34.150
when Paul met him at Listera.

00:58:34.150 --> 00:58:36.150
What did Paul do?

00:58:36.150 --> 00:58:38.150
He took that young man along with him

00:58:38.150 --> 00:58:40.150
on his tours,

00:58:40.150 --> 00:58:42.150
going from congregation to congregation.

00:58:42.150 --> 00:58:44.150
He put him in mind

00:58:44.150 --> 00:58:46.150
of his methods.

00:58:46.150 --> 00:58:48.150
He taught him.

00:58:48.150 --> 00:58:50.150
And as a result,

00:58:50.150 --> 00:58:54.150
a solid, mature Christian man

00:58:54.150 --> 00:58:56.150
who was able to strengthen

00:58:56.150 --> 00:58:58.150
the congregations of God's people.

00:58:58.150 --> 00:59:00.150
Do you remember what Paul said about him

00:59:00.150 --> 00:59:02.150
in Philippians chapter 2?

00:59:02.150 --> 00:59:04.150
It's quite a recommendation.

00:59:04.150 --> 00:59:06.150
Philippians chapter 2

00:59:06.150 --> 00:59:10.150
and verse 20.

00:59:10.150 --> 00:59:14.150
Paul said, for I have no one else

00:59:14.150 --> 00:59:16.150
of a disposition like his

00:59:16.150 --> 00:59:18.150
who will genuinely care

00:59:18.150 --> 00:59:20.150
for your concerns.

00:59:20.150 --> 00:59:22.150
What a tremendous

00:59:22.150 --> 00:59:24.150
recommendation.

00:59:24.150 --> 00:59:26.150
But because Paul had invested that

00:59:26.150 --> 00:59:28.150
time into Timothy,

00:59:28.150 --> 00:59:30.150
he knew the fine qualities

00:59:30.150 --> 00:59:32.150
that young man had.

00:59:32.150 --> 00:59:34.150
Well, Paul not only wanted Timothy

00:59:34.150 --> 00:59:36.150
to take that training himself,

00:59:36.150 --> 00:59:38.150
but you'll recall

00:59:38.150 --> 00:59:40.150
that in 2 Timothy chapter 2,

00:59:40.150 --> 00:59:44.150
he gave advice to Timothy

00:59:44.150 --> 00:59:46.150
as to what he was to do

00:59:46.150 --> 00:59:48.150
with all of that fine training

00:59:48.150 --> 00:59:50.150
that he had received.

00:59:50.150 --> 00:59:52.150
2 Timothy chapter 2

00:59:52.150 --> 00:59:54.150
and verse 2,

00:59:54.150 --> 00:59:56.150
Paul said,

00:59:56.150 --> 00:59:58.150
and the things you heard from me

00:59:58.150 --> 01:00:00.150
that were supported by many witnesses,

01:00:00.150 --> 01:00:02.150
these things

01:00:02.150 --> 01:00:04.150
in trust to faithful men

01:00:04.150 --> 01:00:06.150
who in turn

01:00:06.150 --> 01:00:08.150
will be adequately qualified

01:00:08.150 --> 01:00:10.150
to teach others.

01:00:10.150 --> 01:00:12.150
So that training

01:00:12.150 --> 01:00:14.150
would go on to future brothers

01:00:14.150 --> 01:00:16.150
and future generations

01:00:16.150 --> 01:00:18.150
of servants of Jehovah.

01:00:18.150 --> 01:00:20.150
Paul invested training

01:00:20.150 --> 01:00:22.150
in a very young man

01:00:22.150 --> 01:00:24.150
and it paid off.

01:00:24.150 --> 01:00:26.150
In our modern day,

01:00:26.150 --> 01:00:30.150
I think of Brother Nathan Moore

01:00:30.150 --> 01:00:32.150
as an outstanding trainer.

01:00:32.150 --> 01:00:34.150
When he became the president

01:00:34.150 --> 01:00:36.150
of the Watchtower Society

01:00:36.150 --> 01:00:38.150
in January of 1942,

01:00:38.150 --> 01:00:42.150
he was only 36 years old.

01:00:42.150 --> 01:00:44.150
Now, he could have thought,

01:00:44.150 --> 01:00:46.150
I'm so young.

01:00:46.150 --> 01:00:48.150
I have many, many years ahead of me

01:00:48.150 --> 01:00:50.150
to be able to care for matters.

01:00:50.150 --> 01:00:52.150
And so there really isn't any need

01:00:52.150 --> 01:00:54.150
to train others.

01:00:54.150 --> 01:00:56.150
But Brother Nor did not have

01:00:56.150 --> 01:00:58.150
that disposition.

01:00:58.150 --> 01:01:00.150
He was a trainer

01:01:00.150 --> 01:01:02.150
even at that young age.

01:01:02.150 --> 01:01:04.150
He assigned Brother Milton Henshel

01:01:04.150 --> 01:01:08.150
who was in his mid-twenties

01:01:08.150 --> 01:01:10.150
to be his secretary.

01:01:10.150 --> 01:01:12.150
Brother Nor took Brother Henshel

01:01:12.150 --> 01:01:14.150
with him on his travels

01:01:14.150 --> 01:01:16.150
all over the world to branches

01:01:16.150 --> 01:01:18.150
and missionary homes

01:01:18.150 --> 01:01:20.150
to strengthen the brothers.

01:01:20.150 --> 01:01:22.150
He had him right by his side

01:01:22.150 --> 01:01:24.150
at major conventions

01:01:24.150 --> 01:01:26.150
not just telling him

01:01:26.150 --> 01:01:28.150
but showing him

01:01:28.150 --> 01:01:30.150
how to take the lead.

01:01:30.150 --> 01:01:32.150
And Brother Henshel

01:01:32.150 --> 01:01:34.150
absorbed that training.

01:01:34.150 --> 01:01:36.150
By 1947,

01:01:36.150 --> 01:01:38.150
he was a member of the board of directors

01:01:38.150 --> 01:01:40.150
of the Watchtower Society,

01:01:40.150 --> 01:01:42.150
only 27 years old.

01:01:42.150 --> 01:01:44.150
And he went on to serve

01:01:44.150 --> 01:01:46.150
as a member of the governing body.

01:01:46.150 --> 01:01:48.150
Brother Nor trained other young brothers

01:01:48.150 --> 01:01:50.150
like Don Adams.

01:01:50.150 --> 01:01:52.150
This photo

01:01:52.150 --> 01:01:54.150
that we're about to show

01:01:54.150 --> 01:01:56.150
was taken at a gathering

01:01:56.150 --> 01:02:00.150
on Brother Adams' 70th anniversary

01:02:00.150 --> 01:02:02.150
in full-time service.

01:02:02.150 --> 01:02:04.150
Now, here you see

01:02:04.150 --> 01:02:06.150
a group of young men

01:02:06.150 --> 01:02:08.150
who had trained Robert Wallen,

01:02:08.150 --> 01:02:10.150
Charles Mollahan,

01:02:10.150 --> 01:02:12.150
Davidson Claire,

01:02:12.150 --> 01:02:14.150
and Don Adams.

01:02:14.150 --> 01:02:16.150
All of these men were identified

01:02:16.150 --> 01:02:18.150
when they were very young

01:02:18.150 --> 01:02:20.150
and they worked together

01:02:20.150 --> 01:02:22.150
for more than 50 years faithfully.

01:02:22.150 --> 01:02:24.150
Jehovah helped Brother Nor

01:02:24.150 --> 01:02:28.150
to choose very well.

01:02:28.150 --> 01:02:30.150
But it didn't end there.

01:02:30.150 --> 01:02:32.150
Brother Nor also appointed

01:02:32.150 --> 01:02:34.150
well-qualified young brothers

01:02:34.150 --> 01:02:36.150
who were gillied graduates

01:02:36.150 --> 01:02:38.150
to assignments with great responsibility.

01:02:38.150 --> 01:02:40.150
For example,

01:02:40.150 --> 01:02:42.150
Brother Kenneth Little

01:02:42.150 --> 01:02:44.150
was assigned to be the branch servant

01:02:44.150 --> 01:02:48.150
in Canada when he was 34 years old.

01:02:48.150 --> 01:02:50.150
Brother Denson Hopkinsven

01:02:50.150 --> 01:02:52.150
was assigned as the branch servant

01:02:52.150 --> 01:02:54.150
in the Philippines

01:02:54.150 --> 01:02:56.150
when he was 33 years old.

01:02:56.150 --> 01:02:58.150
And Brother Richard Kelsey

01:02:58.150 --> 01:03:00.150
was assigned as the branch servant

01:03:00.150 --> 01:03:02.150
in Germany

01:03:02.150 --> 01:03:04.150
when he was 38.

01:03:04.150 --> 01:03:06.150
When appointed,

01:03:06.150 --> 01:03:08.150
Brother Kelsey said to Brother Nor,

01:03:08.150 --> 01:03:10.150
but I'm only 38.

01:03:10.150 --> 01:03:12.150
And Brother Nor said,

01:03:12.150 --> 01:03:14.150
well, yeah, that's about the age I was

01:03:14.150 --> 01:03:17.719
when I became president.

01:03:17.719 --> 01:03:19.719
Brother Nor once again had chosen well.

01:03:19.719 --> 01:03:21.719
Those last three brothers

01:03:21.719 --> 01:03:23.719
are all still serving

01:03:23.719 --> 01:03:25.719
on the branch committees

01:03:25.719 --> 01:03:27.719
in their respective lands

01:03:27.719 --> 01:03:29.719
and are all members

01:03:29.719 --> 01:03:31.719
of the Watchtower Bible

01:03:31.719 --> 01:03:33.719
and are tied in today for this meeting.

01:03:33.719 --> 01:03:50.019
Isn't that wonderful?

01:03:50.019 --> 01:03:52.019
But there's a lesson here, brothers.

01:03:52.019 --> 01:03:54.019
There's a lesson.

01:03:54.019 --> 01:03:56.019
Brother Nor expressed confidence

01:03:56.019 --> 01:03:58.019
in humble young brothers.

01:03:58.019 --> 01:04:00.019
He allowed them

01:04:00.019 --> 01:04:02.019
to take on responsibility

01:04:02.019 --> 01:04:04.019
and that proved to be

01:04:04.019 --> 01:04:06.019
a wonderful blessing

01:04:06.019 --> 01:04:08.019
for Jehovah's people.

01:04:08.019 --> 01:04:10.019
Well, what's the lesson then

01:04:10.019 --> 01:04:12.019
for elders,

01:04:12.019 --> 01:04:14.019
for circuit overseers,

01:04:14.019 --> 01:04:16.019
for all mature brothers

01:04:16.019 --> 01:04:18.019
in the congregation?

01:04:18.019 --> 01:04:20.019
We must actively

01:04:20.019 --> 01:04:22.019
be training and teaching

01:04:22.019 --> 01:04:24.019
the next generation

01:04:24.019 --> 01:04:26.019
of ministerial servants,

01:04:26.019 --> 01:04:28.019
the next generation

01:04:28.019 --> 01:04:30.019
of elders,

01:04:30.019 --> 01:04:32.019
the next generation

01:04:32.019 --> 01:04:34.019
of circuit overseers.

01:04:34.019 --> 01:04:36.019
And we must take this responsibility

01:04:36.019 --> 01:04:38.019
seriously.

01:04:38.019 --> 01:04:40.019
Because the truth

01:04:40.019 --> 01:04:42.019
belongs not just to us.

01:04:42.019 --> 01:04:44.019
It also belongs to our sons

01:04:44.019 --> 01:04:46.019
to our descendants.

01:04:46.019 --> 01:04:48.019
We must pass on

01:04:48.019 --> 01:04:50.019
the truth,

01:04:50.019 --> 01:04:52.019
the wisdom,

01:04:52.019 --> 01:04:54.019
the experience that we have

01:04:54.019 --> 01:04:56.019
in our treasure store

01:04:56.019 --> 01:04:58.019
to these next Joshua's,

01:04:58.019 --> 01:05:00.019
these next Timothy's

01:05:00.019 --> 01:05:02.019
that Jehovah will raise up.

01:05:02.019 --> 01:05:04.019
But now that's the role

01:05:04.019 --> 01:05:06.019
of the trainers.

01:05:06.019 --> 01:05:08.019
What is the role

01:05:08.019 --> 01:05:10.019
of you younger brothers

01:05:10.019 --> 01:05:11.019
who are listening to this program?

01:05:11.019 --> 01:05:13.019
Well, it's your responsibility

01:05:13.019 --> 01:05:15.019
to work hard,

01:05:15.019 --> 01:05:17.019
to meet the scriptural qualifications

01:05:17.019 --> 01:05:19.019
for ministerial servants

01:05:19.019 --> 01:05:21.019
and later for elders.

01:05:21.019 --> 01:05:23.019
Seek out training.

01:05:23.019 --> 01:05:25.019
Ask for advice.

01:05:25.019 --> 01:05:27.019
Ask for counsel.

01:05:27.019 --> 01:05:29.019
Be eager

01:05:29.019 --> 01:05:31.019
to learn from older brothers

01:05:31.019 --> 01:05:33.019
who are rich in wisdom

01:05:33.019 --> 01:05:35.019
and experience.

01:05:35.019 --> 01:05:37.019
Now, to help you grow

01:05:37.019 --> 01:05:39.019
those brothers

01:05:39.019 --> 01:05:41.019
who are rich in wisdom

01:05:41.019 --> 01:05:43.019
and experience.

01:05:43.019 --> 01:05:45.019
They may even correct you

01:05:45.019 --> 01:05:47.019
from time to time.

01:05:47.019 --> 01:05:49.019
Will you love them

01:05:49.019 --> 01:05:51.019
for doing that?

01:05:51.019 --> 01:05:53.019
Like Jacob,

01:05:53.019 --> 01:05:55.019
who wrestled with an angel

01:05:55.019 --> 01:05:57.019
to receive a blessing,

01:05:57.019 --> 01:05:59.019
you too may have to wrestle.

01:05:59.019 --> 01:06:01.019
You may have to struggle

01:06:01.019 --> 01:06:03.019
at times to get that blessing,

01:06:03.019 --> 01:06:05.019
to reach that goal.

01:06:05.019 --> 01:06:07.019
But if you work hard

01:06:07.019 --> 01:06:09.019
you will grow spiritually.

01:06:09.019 --> 01:06:11.019
You will draw close to him

01:06:11.019 --> 01:06:13.019
and who knows what

01:06:13.019 --> 01:06:15.019
responsibilities

01:06:15.019 --> 01:06:17.019
may come to you.

01:06:17.019 --> 01:06:19.019
What is the governing body

01:06:19.019 --> 01:06:21.019
doing to support efforts

01:06:21.019 --> 01:06:23.019
to train young brothers?

01:06:23.019 --> 01:06:25.019
Well, in January of this year

01:06:25.019 --> 01:06:27.019
the governing body requested

01:06:27.019 --> 01:06:29.019
all bodies of elders

01:06:29.019 --> 01:06:31.019
worldwide

01:06:31.019 --> 01:06:33.019
to give priority to helping

01:06:33.019 --> 01:06:35.019
younger brothers grow

01:06:35.019 --> 01:06:37.019
congregation

01:06:37.019 --> 01:06:39.019
responsibilities.

01:06:39.019 --> 01:06:41.019
Elders and circuit overseers

01:06:41.019 --> 01:06:43.019
were reminded

01:06:43.019 --> 01:06:45.019
that young brothers

01:06:45.019 --> 01:06:47.019
who applied themselves

01:06:47.019 --> 01:06:49.019
may qualify

01:06:49.019 --> 01:06:51.019
as ministerial servants

01:06:51.019 --> 01:06:53.019
in their late teens.

01:06:53.019 --> 01:06:55.019
And that an exceptional

01:06:55.019 --> 01:06:57.019
ministerial servant

01:06:57.019 --> 01:06:59.019
who has gained experience

01:06:59.019 --> 01:07:01.019
in shepherding and teaching

01:07:01.019 --> 01:07:03.019
could serve as an elder

01:07:03.019 --> 01:07:05.019
servant.

01:07:05.019 --> 01:07:07.019
Now here is another

01:07:07.019 --> 01:07:09.019
arrangement that we have

01:07:09.019 --> 01:07:11.019
not publicly announced before

01:07:11.019 --> 01:07:13.019
but we will today.

01:07:13.019 --> 01:07:15.019
Circuit overseers have

01:07:15.019 --> 01:07:17.019
also been informed

01:07:17.019 --> 01:07:19.019
that they may invite

01:07:19.019 --> 01:07:21.019
qualified young brothers

01:07:21.019 --> 01:07:23.019
between the ages of 21

01:07:23.019 --> 01:07:25.019
and 23

01:07:25.019 --> 01:07:27.019
to apply to attend the

01:07:27.019 --> 01:07:29.019
school for Kingdom

01:07:29.019 --> 01:07:31.019
evangelizers.

01:07:31.019 --> 01:07:33.019
But the efforts

01:07:33.019 --> 01:07:35.019
do not end there.

01:07:35.019 --> 01:07:37.019
Jehovah willing.

01:07:37.019 --> 01:07:39.019
In January 2023

01:07:39.019 --> 01:07:41.019
the School for Kingdom

01:07:41.019 --> 01:07:43.019
evangelizers will again

01:07:43.019 --> 01:07:45.019
begin functioning

01:07:45.019 --> 01:07:47.019
in-person worldwide.

01:07:47.019 --> 01:07:49.019
And as we resume

01:07:49.019 --> 01:07:51.019
in-person regional conventions,

01:07:51.019 --> 01:07:53.019
just imagine the joy

01:07:53.019 --> 01:07:55.019
that we'll have

01:07:55.019 --> 01:07:57.019
in seeing younger brothers

01:07:57.019 --> 01:07:59.019
get up and give their first

01:07:59.019 --> 01:08:01.019
talk at a regional convention.

01:08:01.019 --> 01:08:03.019
Won't that be wonderful?

01:08:03.019 --> 01:08:16.449
Are you looking forward to it?

01:08:16.449 --> 01:08:18.449
But the governing body has

01:08:18.449 --> 01:08:20.449
another new initiative.

01:08:20.449 --> 01:08:22.449
The governing body members

01:08:22.449 --> 01:08:24.449
will now have the possibility

01:08:24.449 --> 01:08:26.449
to take a younger brother

01:08:26.449 --> 01:08:28.449
along with them

01:08:28.449 --> 01:08:30.449
when they make shepherding visits

01:08:30.449 --> 01:08:32.449
to the branches.

01:08:32.449 --> 01:08:34.449
And appointed governing body

01:08:34.449 --> 01:08:36.449
helpers, who are headquarters

01:08:36.449 --> 01:08:38.449
representatives,

01:08:38.449 --> 01:08:40.449
when they make their branch

01:08:40.449 --> 01:08:42.449
visits.

01:08:42.449 --> 01:08:44.449
These arrangements

01:08:44.449 --> 01:08:46.449
will allow many brothers

01:08:46.449 --> 01:08:48.449
to receive additional training

01:08:48.449 --> 01:08:50.449
directly

01:08:50.449 --> 01:08:52.449
from governing body members

01:08:52.449 --> 01:08:54.449
and helpers.

01:08:54.449 --> 01:08:56.449
Well, what have we discussed

01:08:56.449 --> 01:08:58.449
in this brief talk?

01:08:58.449 --> 01:09:00.449
Jehovah has allowed us

01:09:00.449 --> 01:09:02.449
to know the truth.

01:09:02.449 --> 01:09:04.449
He's allowed us to be trained.

01:09:04.449 --> 01:09:06.449
He's allowed us to gain wisdom

01:09:06.449 --> 01:09:08.449
and helpers.

01:09:08.449 --> 01:09:10.449
What now is our responsibility?

01:09:10.449 --> 01:09:12.449
Well, let's read it

01:09:12.449 --> 01:09:14.449
in Psalm 71, because the psalmist

01:09:14.449 --> 01:09:16.449
put it so beautifully here.

01:09:16.449 --> 01:09:20.449
Psalm 71 and verse 17.

01:09:20.449 --> 01:09:24.449
Oh, God, you have taught me

01:09:24.449 --> 01:09:26.449
from my youth.

01:09:26.449 --> 01:09:28.449
And until now, I keep declaring

01:09:28.449 --> 01:09:30.449
your wonderful works.

01:09:30.449 --> 01:09:32.449
Even when I am old and gray,

01:09:32.449 --> 01:09:34.449
oh, God, do not abandon me.

01:09:34.449 --> 01:09:38.449
Let me tell the next generation

01:09:38.449 --> 01:09:40.449
about your power

01:09:40.449 --> 01:09:42.449
and about your mightiness

01:09:42.449 --> 01:09:46.449
to all those who are to come.

01:09:46.449 --> 01:09:48.449
Dear brothers, please,

01:09:48.449 --> 01:09:50.449
let us work hard

01:09:50.449 --> 01:09:52.449
to share the wonderful truths,

01:09:52.449 --> 01:09:54.449
the experience,

01:09:54.449 --> 01:09:56.449
the wisdom that we have gained

01:09:56.449 --> 01:10:00.449
with the generation to come.

01:10:00.449 --> 01:10:06.829
That certainly does

01:10:06.829 --> 01:10:08.829
meet a need, doesn't it?

01:10:08.829 --> 01:10:10.829
Very, very nice.

01:10:10.829 --> 01:10:12.829
Thank you, Mark.

01:10:12.829 --> 01:10:14.829
Now, how did you feel

01:10:14.829 --> 01:10:16.829
during the pandemic

01:10:16.829 --> 01:10:18.829
when you watched videos

01:10:18.829 --> 01:10:20.829
on GW Broadcasting?

01:10:20.829 --> 01:10:22.829
Of happy brothers and sisters

01:10:22.829 --> 01:10:24.829
going from door to door

01:10:24.829 --> 01:10:26.829
and doing artwork

01:10:26.829 --> 01:10:28.829
and conducting Bible studies,

01:10:28.829 --> 01:10:30.829
it made me kind of sad

01:10:30.829 --> 01:10:32.829
because I wanted to do that too.

01:10:32.829 --> 01:10:34.829
But we couldn't

01:10:34.829 --> 01:10:36.829
go into the pandemic.

01:10:36.829 --> 01:10:38.829
Well, now we have access

01:10:38.829 --> 01:10:40.829
to all of our features

01:10:40.829 --> 01:10:42.829
of the ministry.

01:10:42.829 --> 01:10:44.829
So I don't think any of us

01:10:44.829 --> 01:10:46.829
are going to be sad

01:10:46.829 --> 01:10:48.829
when watching the next video.

01:10:48.829 --> 01:10:50.829
It's going to trace the history

01:10:50.829 --> 01:10:52.829
of our preaching activity

01:10:52.829 --> 01:10:56.239
from 1919.

01:10:56.239 --> 01:10:58.239
It's great.

01:10:58.239 --> 01:11:00.239
One hundred years ago

01:11:00.239 --> 01:11:02.239
when our brothers and sisters

01:11:02.239 --> 01:11:04.239
were invited to the 1922

01:11:04.239 --> 01:11:06.239
to be excited.

01:11:06.239 --> 01:11:08.239
Why?

01:11:08.239 --> 01:11:10.239
You see, just three years earlier,

01:11:10.239 --> 01:11:12.239
they had been energized

01:11:12.239 --> 01:11:14.239
by a newly organized approach

01:11:14.239 --> 01:11:16.239
to preach the good news of the kingdom.

01:11:16.239 --> 01:11:18.239
The Bible Students Convention

01:11:18.239 --> 01:11:20.239
in 1919 launched

01:11:20.239 --> 01:11:22.239
a door-to-door campaign

01:11:22.239 --> 01:11:24.239
to obtain subscriptions

01:11:24.239 --> 01:11:26.239
to the newly released

01:11:26.239 --> 01:11:28.239
Golden Age magazine.

01:11:28.239 --> 01:11:30.239
Later that year, a service director

01:11:30.239 --> 01:11:32.239
was appointed for each group of Bible students.

01:11:32.239 --> 01:11:34.239
Now they had clear direction

01:11:34.239 --> 01:11:36.239
in following Jesus' command

01:11:36.239 --> 01:11:38.239
to preach.

01:11:38.239 --> 01:11:40.239
That convention was considered

01:11:40.239 --> 01:11:42.239
by many who were there

01:11:42.239 --> 01:11:44.239
to be the greatest ever help

01:11:44.239 --> 01:11:46.239
up to that time.

01:11:46.239 --> 01:11:48.239
So imagine their anticipation

01:11:48.239 --> 01:11:50.239
when the announcement was made

01:11:50.239 --> 01:11:52.239
of another convention

01:11:52.239 --> 01:11:54.239
in 1922.

01:11:54.239 --> 01:11:56.239
What would it bring?

01:11:56.239 --> 01:11:58.239
Would there be other

01:11:58.239 --> 01:12:00.239
exciting announcements?

01:12:00.239 --> 01:12:02.239
A-D-B, A-D-B, A-D-B?

01:12:02.239 --> 01:12:04.239
A-D-B?

01:12:04.239 --> 01:12:06.239
What is A-D-B?

01:12:06.239 --> 01:12:08.239
Many were guessing this,

01:12:08.239 --> 01:12:10.239
guessing that.

01:12:10.239 --> 01:12:12.239
Behold, the King reigns.

01:12:12.239 --> 01:12:17.680
You are his publicity agents.

01:12:17.680 --> 01:12:19.680
Therefore,

01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:21.680
advertise,

01:12:21.680 --> 01:12:23.680
advertise,

01:12:23.680 --> 01:12:25.680
advertise the King

01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:32.609
and his kingdom.

01:12:32.609 --> 01:12:34.609
Well, they want dry eyes

01:12:34.609 --> 01:12:36.609
when he was crying.

01:12:36.609 --> 01:12:38.609
Everybody was waving the

01:12:38.609 --> 01:12:40.609
anxious and talking

01:12:40.609 --> 01:12:42.609
to whoever was sitting

01:12:42.609 --> 01:12:44.609
by with a new or not.

01:12:44.609 --> 01:12:46.609
Now more than just Bible students,

01:12:46.609 --> 01:12:48.609
they were becoming an organization

01:12:48.609 --> 01:12:50.609
of preachers.

01:12:50.609 --> 01:12:52.609
What would the call

01:12:52.609 --> 01:12:54.609
to advertise the King

01:12:54.609 --> 01:12:56.609
and his kingdom lead to?

01:12:56.609 --> 01:12:58.609
What unique

01:12:58.609 --> 01:13:00.609
and innovative methods

01:13:00.609 --> 01:13:02.609
would Jehovah's people use?

01:13:02.609 --> 01:13:05.619
The next 100 years would tell the story.

01:13:05.619 --> 01:13:07.619
In 1922,

01:13:07.619 --> 01:13:09.619
Jehovah Rutherford began using

01:13:09.619 --> 01:13:11.619
the new technology of

01:13:11.619 --> 01:13:13.619
radio broadcasting,

01:13:13.619 --> 01:13:15.619
to reach a global audience

01:13:15.619 --> 01:13:17.619
with the King the Message.

01:13:17.619 --> 01:13:19.619
At its peak in 1933,

01:13:19.619 --> 01:13:21.619
radio broadcast,

01:13:21.619 --> 01:13:23.619
originating from our own

01:13:23.619 --> 01:13:25.619
WBBR studios in New York

01:13:25.619 --> 01:13:27.619
were carried by

01:13:27.619 --> 01:13:29.619
408 radio stations

01:13:29.619 --> 01:13:31.619
on six continents.

01:13:31.619 --> 01:13:33.619
But because of clergy interference,

01:13:33.619 --> 01:13:35.619
they actually denied access to their

01:13:35.619 --> 01:13:37.619
ones.

01:13:37.619 --> 01:13:39.619
Did opposition stop Jehovah's

01:13:39.619 --> 01:13:41.619
people from advertising

01:13:41.619 --> 01:13:43.619
the kingdom good news?

01:13:43.619 --> 01:13:45.619
What additional preaching methods

01:13:45.619 --> 01:13:47.619
were used?

01:13:47.619 --> 01:13:49.619
A unified, consistent message

01:13:49.619 --> 01:13:51.619
about the kingdom was achieved

01:13:51.619 --> 01:13:53.619
through the use of

01:13:53.619 --> 01:13:55.619
testimony cards in several languages.

01:13:55.619 --> 01:13:57.619
A publisher would simply

01:13:57.619 --> 01:13:59.619
hand the card to the householder

01:13:59.619 --> 01:14:01.619
and ask him to read the

01:14:01.619 --> 01:14:03.619
message.

01:14:03.619 --> 01:14:05.619
Another exciting application

01:14:05.619 --> 01:14:07.619
of technology was the use of

01:14:07.619 --> 01:14:09.619
the portable phonograph

01:14:09.619 --> 01:14:11.619
for house-to-house preaching.

01:14:11.619 --> 01:14:13.619
To expand this initiative

01:14:13.619 --> 01:14:15.619
in 1937 at the Columbus, Ohio convention,

01:14:15.619 --> 01:14:17.619
the special pioneer work was

01:14:17.619 --> 01:14:19.619
introduced.

01:14:19.619 --> 01:14:21.619
Special pioneers were encouraged

01:14:21.619 --> 01:14:23.619
to use the phonograph

01:14:23.619 --> 01:14:25.619
not only when invited

01:14:25.619 --> 01:14:27.619
into a house,

01:14:27.619 --> 01:14:29.619
but at every house.

01:14:29.619 --> 01:14:31.619
In addition,

01:14:31.619 --> 01:14:33.619
three hundred special pioneers

01:14:33.619 --> 01:14:35.619
set up the phonographs

01:14:35.619 --> 01:14:37.619
over a half a million times.

01:14:37.619 --> 01:14:39.619
Playing the pre-recorded

01:14:39.619 --> 01:14:41.619
four and a half minute talks

01:14:41.619 --> 01:14:43.619
by Brother Rutherford

01:14:43.619 --> 01:14:45.619
to over one million listeners.

01:14:45.619 --> 01:14:47.619
Other kingdom publishers

01:14:47.619 --> 01:14:49.619
thus became phonograph-minded

01:14:49.619 --> 01:14:51.619
and eventually over 47,000

01:14:51.619 --> 01:14:53.619
portable phonographs

01:14:53.619 --> 01:14:55.619
with records covering 92 topics

01:14:55.619 --> 01:14:57.619
trumpeted the kingdom message.

01:14:57.619 --> 01:14:59.619
To preach from the house-tops,

01:14:59.619 --> 01:15:01.619
Zealous Kingdom publishers

01:15:01.619 --> 01:15:03.619
amplify their ministry

01:15:03.619 --> 01:15:05.619
with transcription machines

01:15:05.619 --> 01:15:07.619
that broadcast Brother Rutherford's

01:15:07.619 --> 01:15:09.619
full length pre-recorded lectures.

01:15:09.619 --> 01:15:11.619
A transcription machine

01:15:11.619 --> 01:15:13.619
was a phonograph equipped

01:15:13.619 --> 01:15:15.619
with powered loudspeakers.

01:15:15.619 --> 01:15:17.619
This made possible sound cars

01:15:17.619 --> 01:15:19.619
and sound boats.

01:15:19.619 --> 01:15:21.619
The kingdom message was

01:15:21.619 --> 01:15:23.619
clearly heard on rivers,

01:15:23.619 --> 01:15:25.619
on streets,

01:15:25.619 --> 01:15:27.619
parks, and squares,

01:15:27.619 --> 01:15:29.619
and rented halls,

01:15:29.619 --> 01:15:31.619
theaters, and other public spaces.

01:15:31.619 --> 01:15:33.619
Equipped with tracks,

01:15:33.619 --> 01:15:35.619
booklets,

01:15:35.619 --> 01:15:37.619
magazines and books,

01:15:37.619 --> 01:15:39.619
thousands of volunteers

01:15:39.619 --> 01:15:41.619
participated in special preaching

01:15:41.619 --> 01:15:43.619
and literature distribution campaigns.

01:15:43.619 --> 01:15:45.619
These special campaigns

01:15:45.619 --> 01:15:47.619
made it possible to cover

01:15:47.619 --> 01:15:49.619
large areas with the kingdom message

01:15:49.619 --> 01:15:51.619
quickly, even in a face of opposition.

01:15:51.619 --> 01:15:53.619
Streetwork,

01:15:53.619 --> 01:15:55.619
information marches,

01:15:55.619 --> 01:15:57.619
and bicycle parades

01:15:57.619 --> 01:15:59.619
boldly brought the kingdom message

01:15:59.619 --> 01:16:01.619
directly before the eyes of the public.

01:16:01.619 --> 01:16:03.619
Marches ranged in size

01:16:03.619 --> 01:16:05.619
from just a few publishers

01:16:05.619 --> 01:16:07.619
to about a thousand publishers.

01:16:07.619 --> 01:16:09.619
Streams of kingdom publishers

01:16:09.619 --> 01:16:11.619
made their way

01:16:11.619 --> 01:16:13.619
through the business districts

01:16:13.619 --> 01:16:15.619
of large cities.

01:16:15.619 --> 01:16:17.619
They wore placards

01:16:17.619 --> 01:16:19.619
bearing a slogan,

01:16:19.619 --> 01:16:21.619
carried signs,

01:16:21.619 --> 01:16:23.619
to talk at a public meeting.

01:16:23.619 --> 01:16:25.619
While radio broadcast

01:16:25.619 --> 01:16:27.619
and information marches

01:16:27.619 --> 01:16:29.619
were an efficient way

01:16:29.619 --> 01:16:31.619
of reaching mass audiences,

01:16:31.619 --> 01:16:33.619
was it the most effective way?

01:16:33.619 --> 01:16:35.619
Our primary method of preaching,

01:16:35.619 --> 01:16:37.619
the personal door

01:16:37.619 --> 01:16:39.619
to door ministry,

01:16:39.619 --> 01:16:41.619
has proved over time

01:16:41.619 --> 01:16:43.619
to be the most effective method

01:16:43.619 --> 01:16:45.619
of advertising the kingdom.

01:16:45.619 --> 01:16:47.619
But was preaching all

01:16:47.619 --> 01:16:49.619
that was needed?

01:16:49.619 --> 01:16:51.619
That teaching others

01:16:51.619 --> 01:16:53.619
to observe all the things

01:16:53.619 --> 01:16:55.619
Jesus commanded

01:16:55.619 --> 01:16:57.619
would require training.

01:16:57.619 --> 01:16:59.619
Kingdom evangelizers

01:16:59.619 --> 01:17:01.619
needed to be trained

01:17:01.619 --> 01:17:03.619
to use the Bible effectively

01:17:03.619 --> 01:17:05.619
and to study it

01:17:05.619 --> 01:17:07.619
with interested ones.

01:17:07.619 --> 01:17:09.619
So at the call to action assembly

01:17:09.619 --> 01:17:11.619
in 1943,

01:17:11.619 --> 01:17:13.619
a new congregation meeting

01:17:13.619 --> 01:17:15.619
was announced and demonstrated.

01:17:15.619 --> 01:17:17.619
It was called

01:17:17.619 --> 01:17:19.619
soon textbooks

01:17:19.619 --> 01:17:21.619
were released to help our brothers

01:17:21.619 --> 01:17:23.619
cultivate their teaching skills.

01:17:23.619 --> 01:17:25.619
The books Theocratic Aid

01:17:25.619 --> 01:17:27.619
published in 1945

01:17:27.619 --> 01:17:29.619
provided clear guidance

01:17:29.619 --> 01:17:31.619
for improved public speaking,

01:17:31.619 --> 01:17:33.619
effective door-to-door witnessing,

01:17:33.619 --> 01:17:35.619
making meaningful return visits

01:17:35.619 --> 01:17:37.619
and conducting progressive Bible studies.

01:17:37.619 --> 01:17:39.619
While equipped for every good work,

01:17:39.619 --> 01:17:41.619
released in 1946,

01:17:41.619 --> 01:17:43.619
laid a solid foundation

01:17:43.619 --> 01:17:45.619
of Bible truth through an in-depth

01:17:45.619 --> 01:17:47.619
book by book examination

01:17:47.619 --> 01:17:49.619
of God's Word.

01:17:49.619 --> 01:17:51.619
Preachers were learning

01:17:51.619 --> 01:17:53.619
to become teachers.

01:17:53.619 --> 01:17:55.619
Such high-quality training

01:17:55.619 --> 01:17:57.619
equipped more to join

01:17:57.619 --> 01:17:59.619
the ranks of kingdom proclaimers.

01:17:59.619 --> 01:18:01.619
And for those who were already

01:18:01.619 --> 01:18:03.619
active, training allowed

01:18:03.619 --> 01:18:05.619
them to expand their participation.

01:18:05.619 --> 01:18:07.619
The ranks of kingdom publishers

01:18:07.619 --> 01:18:09.619
swell.

01:18:09.619 --> 01:18:11.619
Around the same time,

01:18:11.619 --> 01:18:13.619
the Watchtower Bible School

01:18:13.619 --> 01:18:15.619
of Gilea began training

01:18:15.619 --> 01:18:17.619
kingdom proclaimers to take up

01:18:17.619 --> 01:18:19.619
missionary work,

01:18:19.619 --> 01:18:21.619
in lands where there were few

01:18:21.619 --> 01:18:23.619
if any kingdom publishers.

01:18:23.619 --> 01:18:25.619
In the years since,

01:18:25.619 --> 01:18:27.619
thousands of trained missionaries

01:18:27.619 --> 01:18:29.619
have advertised the king

01:18:29.619 --> 01:18:31.619
in his kingdom to the ends of the earth.

01:18:31.619 --> 01:18:33.619
Additionally, the teaching tools

01:18:33.619 --> 01:18:35.619
provided by the faithful slave

01:18:35.619 --> 01:18:37.619
have steadily adapted

01:18:37.619 --> 01:18:39.619
to changing needs.

01:18:39.619 --> 01:18:41.619
Study publications,

01:18:41.619 --> 01:18:43.619
the truth that leads

01:18:43.619 --> 01:18:45.619
to eternal life.

01:18:45.619 --> 01:18:47.619
And now, enjoy life forever

01:18:47.619 --> 01:18:49.619
and interactive Bible course

01:18:49.619 --> 01:18:51.619
have proved to be extremely

01:18:51.619 --> 01:18:53.619
effective teaching tools.

01:18:53.619 --> 01:18:55.619
Huge

01:18:55.619 --> 01:18:57.619
international conventions

01:18:57.619 --> 01:18:58.619
with record-breaking

01:18:58.619 --> 01:18:59.619
attendences have generated

01:18:59.619 --> 01:19:01.619
global headlines

01:19:01.619 --> 01:19:03.619
advertising Jehovah's

01:19:03.619 --> 01:19:05.619
organization.

01:19:05.619 --> 01:19:07.619
Films, DVDs,

01:19:07.619 --> 01:19:09.619
and JW Broadcasting

01:19:09.619 --> 01:19:11.619
videos have helped

01:19:11.619 --> 01:19:13.619
prospective subjects of the kingdom

01:19:13.619 --> 01:19:15.619
visualize the realities

01:19:15.619 --> 01:19:17.619
of that kingdom.

01:19:17.619 --> 01:19:19.619
Our special metropolitan witnessing

01:19:19.619 --> 01:19:21.619
and public witnessing carts

01:19:21.619 --> 01:19:23.619
continue to draw attention to the kingdom.

01:19:23.619 --> 01:19:25.619
JW.org has played a vital role

01:19:25.619 --> 01:19:27.619
in reaching millions

01:19:27.619 --> 01:19:29.619
with the kingdom proclamation

01:19:29.619 --> 01:19:31.619
in over a thousand languages.

01:19:31.619 --> 01:19:33.619
How true are the words

01:19:33.619 --> 01:19:35.619
of Melvin Sargent,

01:19:35.619 --> 01:19:37.619
one of many faithful brothers

01:19:37.619 --> 01:19:39.619
who have experienced

01:19:39.619 --> 01:19:41.619
much of this history.

01:19:41.619 --> 01:19:43.619
Those of us inside

01:19:43.619 --> 01:19:45.619
the Lord's organization

01:19:45.619 --> 01:19:47.619
have tried

01:19:47.619 --> 01:19:49.619
in every way possible

01:19:49.619 --> 01:19:51.619
to turn the world's attention

01:19:51.619 --> 01:19:53.619
to the message of life.

01:19:53.619 --> 01:19:55.619
We have used slogans,

01:19:55.619 --> 01:19:57.619
full-page advertisements,

01:19:57.619 --> 01:19:59.619
radio,

01:19:59.619 --> 01:20:01.619
sound cars,

01:20:01.619 --> 01:20:03.619
portable phonographs,

01:20:03.619 --> 01:20:05.619
gigantic conventions,

01:20:05.619 --> 01:20:07.619
and a growing army

01:20:07.619 --> 01:20:09.619
of house-to-house ministers.

01:20:09.619 --> 01:20:11.619
This brief report

01:20:11.619 --> 01:20:13.619
on the past 100 years

01:20:13.619 --> 01:20:15.619
of kingdom preaching merely

01:20:15.619 --> 01:20:17.619
scratches the surface

01:20:17.619 --> 01:20:19.619
of what's contained in the new

01:20:19.619 --> 01:20:21.619
special exhibit

01:20:21.619 --> 01:20:23.619
at the World Headquarters Museum

01:20:23.619 --> 01:20:25.619
at Warwick, New York.

01:20:25.619 --> 01:20:27.619
It's entitled Advertise,

01:20:27.619 --> 01:20:29.619
Advertise, Advertise,

01:20:29.619 --> 01:20:31.619
100 years of

01:20:31.619 --> 01:20:33.619
advertising the kingdom.

01:20:33.619 --> 01:20:35.619
When visits become

01:20:35.619 --> 01:20:37.619
possible, please come

01:20:37.619 --> 01:20:39.619
and see this informative

01:20:39.619 --> 01:20:41.619
and motivating display.

01:20:41.619 --> 01:20:43.619
How thrilling it is

01:20:43.619 --> 01:20:45.619
that alongside our brothers

01:20:45.619 --> 01:20:47.619
and sisters of the past 100 years,

01:20:47.619 --> 01:20:49.619
we have shared together

01:20:49.619 --> 01:20:51.619
and fulfilling Jesus' prophecy

01:20:51.619 --> 01:20:53.619
that this good news of the kingdom

01:20:53.619 --> 01:20:55.619
will be preached

01:20:55.619 --> 01:20:57.619
in all the inhabited earth.

01:20:57.619 --> 01:20:59.619
May this new special exhibit

01:20:59.619 --> 01:21:01.619
energize you to continue

01:21:01.619 --> 01:21:03.619
in the future.

01:21:03.619 --> 01:21:05.619
What does it mean

01:21:05.619 --> 01:21:07.619
to advertise?

01:21:07.619 --> 01:21:16.220
Advertise, Advertise,

01:21:16.220 --> 01:21:18.220
the king and his kingdom?

01:21:18.220 --> 01:21:20.220
Well, that video was just

01:21:20.220 --> 01:21:22.220
the ticket, wasn't it?

01:21:22.220 --> 01:21:24.220
Because we're resuming our

01:21:24.220 --> 01:21:26.220
door-to-door ministry now,

01:21:26.220 --> 01:21:28.220
and so this gets us all enthusiastic

01:21:28.220 --> 01:21:30.220
ready to go on service.

01:21:30.220 --> 01:21:32.220
I'm sure you're

01:21:32.220 --> 01:21:34.220
already to go on service now.

01:21:34.220 --> 01:21:36.220
But don't leave just yet

01:21:36.220 --> 01:21:37.220
because we have one final talk.

01:21:37.220 --> 01:21:39.220
Brother Lent always has

01:21:39.220 --> 01:21:41.220
something interesting to tell us.

01:21:41.220 --> 01:21:43.220
No pressure, Steve.

01:21:43.220 --> 01:21:45.220
And he's got a very

01:21:45.220 --> 01:21:47.220
intriguing theme.

01:21:47.220 --> 01:21:49.220
Why must all kiss

01:21:49.220 --> 01:21:54.800
God's Son?

01:21:54.800 --> 01:21:56.800
In four of his letters,

01:21:56.800 --> 01:21:58.800
the Apostle Paul encouraged

01:21:58.800 --> 01:22:00.800
fellow Christians

01:22:00.800 --> 01:22:02.800
to greet one another

01:22:02.800 --> 01:22:04.800
with a holy kiss.

01:22:04.800 --> 01:22:06.800
Similarly, Peter used

01:22:06.800 --> 01:22:08.800
the expression,

01:22:08.800 --> 01:22:10.800
greet one another

01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:12.800
with a kiss of love.

01:22:12.800 --> 01:22:16.800
Now, why was that encouragement given?

01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:18.800
Because giving a kiss

01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:20.800
was a token of affection,

01:22:20.800 --> 01:22:22.800
honor, or peace.

01:22:22.800 --> 01:22:24.800
Well, in a similar vein,

01:22:24.800 --> 01:22:26.800
notice what Jehovah

01:22:26.800 --> 01:22:28.800
commands us to do.

01:22:28.800 --> 01:22:30.800
In Psalm 2, please.

01:22:30.800 --> 01:22:32.800
Go to the second Psalm,

01:22:32.800 --> 01:22:36.800
and let's read verse 12.

01:22:36.800 --> 01:22:38.800
Jehovah says, honor,

01:22:38.800 --> 01:22:40.800
or if you look at the footnote,

01:22:40.800 --> 01:22:42.800
literally, kiss.

01:22:42.800 --> 01:22:44.800
Kiss the Son

01:22:44.800 --> 01:22:46.800
or God will become

01:22:46.800 --> 01:22:48.800
indignant

01:22:48.800 --> 01:22:50.800
and you will perish from the way.

01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:52.800
For his,

01:22:52.800 --> 01:22:54.800
Jehovah's anger

01:22:54.800 --> 01:22:56.800
flares up quickly.

01:22:56.800 --> 01:22:58.800
You notice, Jehovah

01:22:58.800 --> 01:23:00.800
doesn't present this

01:23:00.800 --> 01:23:02.800
as an option, does he?

01:23:02.800 --> 01:23:04.800
He didn't say, I recommend,

01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:05.800
I suggest you kiss my son.

01:23:05.800 --> 01:23:07.800
It's actually presented

01:23:07.800 --> 01:23:09.800
as a decree,

01:23:09.800 --> 01:23:11.800
a powerful statement,

01:23:11.800 --> 01:23:13.800
indeed, and Jehovah takes it

01:23:13.800 --> 01:23:15.800
very personal,

01:23:15.800 --> 01:23:17.800
whether we warmly, affectionately,

01:23:17.800 --> 01:23:19.800
welcome his son,

01:23:19.800 --> 01:23:21.800
or not, see.

01:23:21.800 --> 01:23:23.800
Those who do not do so,

01:23:23.800 --> 01:23:27.800
do not kiss the son,

01:23:27.800 --> 01:23:29.800
warmly welcome him,

01:23:29.800 --> 01:23:31.800
will perish

01:23:31.800 --> 01:23:33.800
as result of Jehovah's anger.

01:23:33.800 --> 01:23:35.800
Or put another way

01:23:35.800 --> 01:23:37.800
such ones

01:23:37.800 --> 01:23:39.800
will meet God.

01:23:39.800 --> 01:23:41.800
Now, let's talk about this

01:23:41.800 --> 01:23:43.800
just for a little bit.

01:23:43.800 --> 01:23:45.800
The Israelites, because they were so disobedient,

01:23:45.800 --> 01:23:47.800
were warned

01:23:47.800 --> 01:23:49.800
by Jehovah through Amos,

01:23:49.800 --> 01:23:51.800
the prophet, at Amos 4-12,

01:23:51.800 --> 01:23:53.800
get ready

01:23:53.800 --> 01:23:55.800
to meet your God.

01:23:55.800 --> 01:23:57.800
Now, that expression

01:23:57.800 --> 01:23:59.800
reminds me

01:23:59.800 --> 01:24:01.800
when I was a young teenager

01:24:01.800 --> 01:24:03.800
in the southern part of the United States,

01:24:03.800 --> 01:24:05.800
along the highways,

01:24:05.800 --> 01:24:07.800
we would often see

01:24:07.800 --> 01:24:09.800
religious billboards.

01:24:09.800 --> 01:24:11.800
And a common sign read,

01:24:11.800 --> 01:24:13.800
are you ready to meet God?

01:24:13.800 --> 01:24:15.800
And it was supposed to be based

01:24:15.800 --> 01:24:17.800
on Amos 4-12.

01:24:17.800 --> 01:24:19.800
Now, we ask,

01:24:19.800 --> 01:24:21.800
and it was explained to us,

01:24:21.800 --> 01:24:23.800
that the meaning was,

01:24:23.800 --> 01:24:25.800
are you ready to go to heaven,

01:24:25.800 --> 01:24:27.800
meet God face to face

01:24:27.800 --> 01:24:29.800
and thereafter live in heaven?

01:24:29.800 --> 01:24:31.800
Or meet was being used

01:24:31.800 --> 01:24:33.800
with a favorable connotation.

01:24:33.800 --> 01:24:35.800
But as we indicated,

01:24:35.800 --> 01:24:37.800
that's not the meaning of

01:24:37.800 --> 01:24:39.800
Amos 4-12.

01:24:39.800 --> 01:24:41.800
Not get ready to introduce yourself

01:24:41.800 --> 01:24:43.800
to God in a friendly way.

01:24:43.800 --> 01:24:45.800
Far from it.

01:24:45.800 --> 01:24:47.800
Jehovah through Amos

01:24:47.800 --> 01:24:51.800
was warning those disobedient Israelites

01:24:51.800 --> 01:24:53.800
they were going to meet God

01:24:53.800 --> 01:24:55.800
by means of a head-on collision.

01:24:55.800 --> 01:24:57.800
It was going to be similar

01:24:57.800 --> 01:25:01.800
to a little ant walking in a train rail

01:25:01.800 --> 01:25:03.800
walking south being met

01:25:03.800 --> 01:25:05.800
by locomotive coming north.

01:25:05.800 --> 01:25:07.800
That's what the Israelites

01:25:07.800 --> 01:25:09.800
would experience.

01:25:09.800 --> 01:25:11.800
And sure enough,

01:25:11.800 --> 01:25:13.800
as Jehovah warned,

01:25:13.800 --> 01:25:15.800
some years later,

01:25:15.800 --> 01:25:17.800
the Israelites met God

01:25:17.800 --> 01:25:19.800
when they received his adverse judgment

01:25:19.800 --> 01:25:21.800
when a Syria conquered

01:25:21.800 --> 01:25:23.800
and devastated them.

01:25:23.800 --> 01:25:25.800
But here's a question,

01:25:25.800 --> 01:25:27.800
what get ready to meet your

01:25:27.800 --> 01:25:29.800
God message is being

01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:31.800
sounded by God's people today?

01:25:31.800 --> 01:25:33.800
Well, it's true,

01:25:33.800 --> 01:25:35.800
we sound the good news

01:25:35.800 --> 01:25:37.800
of the kingdom.

01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:39.800
But we also sound a warning message,

01:25:39.800 --> 01:25:41.800
don't we?

01:25:41.800 --> 01:25:43.800
We warn that all who do not

01:25:43.800 --> 01:25:45.800
take a stand with Jehovah

01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:47.800
and walk with him

01:25:47.800 --> 01:25:49.800
but continue to walk in opposition

01:25:49.800 --> 01:25:51.800
will meet him in a head-on

01:25:51.800 --> 01:25:53.800
collision.

01:25:53.800 --> 01:25:55.800
And here's another question,

01:25:55.800 --> 01:25:57.800
what will happen in the near future

01:25:57.800 --> 01:25:59.800
and we've learned during the great tribulation

01:25:59.800 --> 01:26:01.800
to the tone,

01:26:01.800 --> 01:26:03.800
the tenor

01:26:03.800 --> 01:26:05.800
of our get ready

01:26:05.800 --> 01:26:07.800
to meet your God warning message?

01:26:07.800 --> 01:26:09.800
Well, for the answer,

01:26:09.800 --> 01:26:13.800
let's go to Revelation chapter 16.

01:26:13.800 --> 01:26:15.800
Revelation chapter 16

01:26:15.800 --> 01:26:17.800
and please,

01:26:17.800 --> 01:26:21.050
let's read verse 21,

01:26:21.050 --> 01:26:23.050
then great hailstones,

01:26:23.050 --> 01:26:25.050
each about the weight of a talent

01:26:25.050 --> 01:26:27.050
fell from heaven on the people

01:26:27.050 --> 01:26:29.050
and the people

01:26:29.050 --> 01:26:31.050
blaspheme God

01:26:31.050 --> 01:26:33.050
because of the plague of hell

01:26:33.050 --> 01:26:35.050
for the plague

01:26:35.050 --> 01:26:39.050
was unusually great.

01:26:39.050 --> 01:26:41.050
Well, our publications have explained

01:26:41.050 --> 01:26:43.050
that of course right now

01:26:43.050 --> 01:26:45.050
we take the soft waters

01:26:45.050 --> 01:26:47.050
of truth to people

01:26:47.050 --> 01:26:49.050
encouraging them to turn to Jehovah.

01:26:49.050 --> 01:26:51.050
But soon during the great tribulation

01:26:51.050 --> 01:26:53.050
the tone,

01:26:53.050 --> 01:26:55.050
the tenor

01:26:55.050 --> 01:26:57.050
will turn hard.

01:26:57.050 --> 01:26:59.050
It will announce the imminent end

01:26:59.050 --> 01:27:03.050
of Satan's entire wicked system.

01:27:03.050 --> 01:27:05.050
The soft waters of truth

01:27:05.050 --> 01:27:07.050
will congeal

01:27:07.050 --> 01:27:09.050
to become the hard

01:27:09.050 --> 01:27:11.050
hitting hailstones

01:27:11.050 --> 01:27:13.050
of truth.

01:27:13.050 --> 01:27:15.050
And this message will be so powerful

01:27:15.050 --> 01:27:17.050
that as indicated there

01:27:17.050 --> 01:27:19.050
in that scripture we read that

01:27:19.050 --> 01:27:21.050
the people

01:27:21.050 --> 01:27:23.050
will blaspheme God.

01:27:23.050 --> 01:27:25.050
They will be very upset.

01:27:25.050 --> 01:27:27.050
They will be very disturbed

01:27:27.050 --> 01:27:29.050
and it's likened

01:27:29.050 --> 01:27:31.050
to a great hailstone

01:27:31.050 --> 01:27:33.050
with every hailstone

01:27:33.050 --> 01:27:35.050
a great hailstorm I should say

01:27:35.050 --> 01:27:37.050
with every hailstone

01:27:37.050 --> 01:27:39.050
weighing about a talent.

01:27:39.050 --> 01:27:41.050
Now, the Revelation

01:27:41.050 --> 01:27:43.050
climax book said

01:27:43.050 --> 01:27:45.050
if the Apostle John had in mind

01:27:45.050 --> 01:27:47.050
the Greek talent

01:27:47.050 --> 01:27:49.050
was about 45 pounds.

01:27:49.050 --> 01:27:51.050
Some years ago interestingly

01:27:51.050 --> 01:27:53.050
there was a little article

01:27:53.050 --> 01:27:55.050
or a little account

01:27:55.050 --> 01:27:57.050
in the watchtower

01:27:57.050 --> 01:27:59.050
about egg-sized hail

01:27:59.050 --> 01:28:01.050
falling in China

01:28:01.050 --> 01:28:03.050
and killing 25 people

01:28:03.050 --> 01:28:05.050
and wounding 200 additional people.

01:28:05.050 --> 01:28:07.050
Now, think about it.

01:28:07.050 --> 01:28:09.050
If hailstones weighing only

01:28:09.050 --> 01:28:11.050
ounces could do that

01:28:11.050 --> 01:28:13.050
what about 45 pound

01:28:13.050 --> 01:28:15.050
hailstones

01:28:15.050 --> 01:28:17.050
and especially if you factor

01:28:17.050 --> 01:28:19.050
in how fast they fall?

01:28:19.050 --> 01:28:23.050
Experts say a large hailstone

01:28:23.050 --> 01:28:25.050
can fall at speeds

01:28:25.050 --> 01:28:29.050
faster than 100 miles an hour.

01:28:29.050 --> 01:28:31.050
And interestingly

01:28:31.050 --> 01:28:33.050
not long ago the watchtower

01:28:33.050 --> 01:28:35.050
made the comment that it could

01:28:35.050 --> 01:28:37.050
well be that our hailstone

01:28:37.050 --> 01:28:39.050
message that we're commissioned

01:28:39.050 --> 01:28:41.050
to give will be what

01:28:41.050 --> 01:28:43.050
induce this Gorg

01:28:43.050 --> 01:28:45.050
of May Gorg

01:28:45.050 --> 01:28:47.050
to make his all-out attack

01:28:47.050 --> 01:28:49.050
against Jehovah's people

01:28:49.050 --> 01:28:51.050
with the intention of wiping

01:28:51.050 --> 01:28:53.050
them from the earth.

01:28:53.050 --> 01:28:55.050
And of course we know the attack of Gorg

01:28:55.050 --> 01:28:57.050
is the event

01:28:57.050 --> 01:28:59.050
that will enrage Jehovah

01:28:59.050 --> 01:29:01.050
and move him

01:29:01.050 --> 01:29:03.050
to bring on the rescue operation

01:29:03.050 --> 01:29:05.050
of Armageddon.

01:29:05.050 --> 01:29:07.050
But right now we're still

01:29:07.050 --> 01:29:09.050
in the Kiss God Sun

01:29:09.050 --> 01:29:11.050
and time period.

01:29:11.050 --> 01:29:15.050
We're happy about that right?

01:29:15.050 --> 01:29:17.050
But don't get too comfortable

01:29:17.050 --> 01:29:19.050
with that message either.

01:29:19.050 --> 01:29:21.050
We entreat honest

01:29:21.050 --> 01:29:23.050
hearted ones

01:29:23.050 --> 01:29:25.050
to honor Gorg Sun.

01:29:25.050 --> 01:29:27.050
To warmly welcome him

01:29:27.050 --> 01:29:29.050
as Earth's new ruler

01:29:29.050 --> 01:29:31.050
and we do this urgently don't we?

01:29:31.050 --> 01:29:33.050
During the time

01:29:33.050 --> 01:29:35.050
before that hard

01:29:35.050 --> 01:29:37.050
hitting get ready to meet your

01:29:37.050 --> 01:29:39.050
time period

01:29:39.050 --> 01:29:41.050
arrives.

01:29:41.050 --> 01:29:43.050
But now here's a very important

01:29:43.050 --> 01:29:45.050
question.

01:29:45.050 --> 01:29:47.050
Are we motivated

01:29:47.050 --> 01:29:49.050
to kiss God's son

01:29:49.050 --> 01:29:51.050
only because we don't want

01:29:51.050 --> 01:29:53.050
to experience the adverse

01:29:53.050 --> 01:29:55.050
consequences of not doing so?

01:29:55.050 --> 01:29:57.050
No.

01:29:57.050 --> 01:29:59.050
Our main motivator

01:29:59.050 --> 01:30:01.050
is love isn't it?

01:30:01.050 --> 01:30:03.050
We love Jehovah

01:30:03.050 --> 01:30:05.050
and we love his dear son

01:30:05.050 --> 01:30:07.050
Earth's new ruler.

01:30:07.050 --> 01:30:09.050
That love is what mainly

01:30:09.050 --> 01:30:11.050
motivates us to do so

01:30:11.050 --> 01:30:13.050
to kiss welcome God's son

01:30:13.050 --> 01:30:15.050
and of course we want to help

01:30:15.050 --> 01:30:17.050
honest hearted ones as we teach them

01:30:17.050 --> 01:30:19.050
to likewise kiss God's son

01:30:19.050 --> 01:30:21.050
because they are

01:30:21.050 --> 01:30:23.050
motivated by love.

01:30:23.050 --> 01:30:25.050
But Jesus

01:30:25.050 --> 01:30:27.050
is Jehovah's choice isn't he?

01:30:27.050 --> 01:30:29.050
Jehovah has selected him

01:30:29.050 --> 01:30:31.050
has installed him as

01:30:31.050 --> 01:30:33.050
King of the Kingdom

01:30:33.050 --> 01:30:35.050
and he will be the absolute

01:30:35.050 --> 01:30:37.050
best ruler that humans

01:30:37.050 --> 01:30:39.050
could ever have.

01:30:39.050 --> 01:30:41.050
Why? What will make Jesus

01:30:41.050 --> 01:30:43.050
the very best ruler?

01:30:43.050 --> 01:30:45.050
Well one thing, he will have

01:30:45.050 --> 01:30:47.050
superhuman abilities.

01:30:47.050 --> 01:30:49.050
And he will demonstrate

01:30:49.050 --> 01:30:51.050
he will have these

01:30:51.050 --> 01:30:53.050
during his thousand year reign

01:30:53.050 --> 01:30:55.050
it will make him a wonderful

01:30:55.050 --> 01:30:57.050
very loving ruler.

01:30:57.050 --> 01:30:59.050
In fact, let's identify

01:30:59.050 --> 01:31:01.050
six superhuman abilities

01:31:01.050 --> 01:31:03.050
that Jesus will possess

01:31:03.050 --> 01:31:05.050
and demonstrate

01:31:05.050 --> 01:31:07.050
during his wonderful thousand year

01:31:07.050 --> 01:31:09.050
reign.

01:31:09.050 --> 01:31:11.050
And to identify each of these six

01:31:11.050 --> 01:31:13.050
superhuman abilities

01:31:13.050 --> 01:31:15.050
we are going to use a miracle

01:31:15.050 --> 01:31:17.050
that Jesus performed here on the earth

01:31:17.050 --> 01:31:19.050
because we know

01:31:19.050 --> 01:31:21.050
the earthly miracles

01:31:21.050 --> 01:31:23.050
portend foreshadow

01:31:23.050 --> 01:31:25.050
even greater miracles

01:31:25.050 --> 01:31:27.050
during his time as

01:31:27.050 --> 01:31:29.050
Messianic King.

01:31:29.050 --> 01:31:33.050
And let's identify

01:31:33.050 --> 01:31:35.050
superhuman ability number one.

01:31:35.050 --> 01:31:37.050
Mark chapter four

01:31:37.050 --> 01:31:39.050
verse 37

01:31:39.050 --> 01:31:43.050
now a great, violent

01:31:43.050 --> 01:31:45.050
windstorm broke out

01:31:45.050 --> 01:31:47.050
and the waves kept crashing

01:31:47.050 --> 01:31:49.050
into the boat

01:31:49.050 --> 01:31:51.050
so that the boat was

01:31:51.050 --> 01:31:53.050
close to being swamped

01:31:53.050 --> 01:31:55.050
but he, Jesus, was in

01:31:55.050 --> 01:31:57.050
the stern

01:31:57.050 --> 01:31:59.050
of being on the pillow

01:31:59.050 --> 01:32:01.050
so they woke him up

01:32:01.050 --> 01:32:03.050
and he said to him,

01:32:03.050 --> 01:32:05.050
teacher,

01:32:05.050 --> 01:32:07.050
do you not care that we're about

01:32:07.050 --> 01:32:09.050
to perish?

01:32:09.050 --> 01:32:11.050
With that he got up

01:32:11.050 --> 01:32:13.050
and rebuked the wind

01:32:13.050 --> 01:32:15.050
and said to the sea,

01:32:15.050 --> 01:32:17.050
hush, be quiet

01:32:17.050 --> 01:32:19.050
and the wind abated

01:32:19.050 --> 01:32:21.050
and a great calm

01:32:21.050 --> 01:32:23.050
set in.

01:32:23.050 --> 01:32:25.050
Now you notice

01:32:25.050 --> 01:32:27.050
with a double adjective

01:32:27.050 --> 01:32:29.050
great, violent windstorm

01:32:29.050 --> 01:32:31.050
indicating its ferocity

01:32:31.050 --> 01:32:33.050
but with three

01:32:33.050 --> 01:32:35.050
simple words, hush,

01:32:35.050 --> 01:32:37.050
be quiet.

01:32:37.050 --> 01:32:39.050
Jesus completely calm both

01:32:39.050 --> 01:32:41.050
wind and sea

01:32:41.050 --> 01:32:43.050
but now what is that miracle

01:32:43.050 --> 01:32:45.050
portend for the future?

01:32:45.050 --> 01:32:47.050
Well as Messianic King

01:32:47.050 --> 01:32:49.050
Jesus will have the

01:32:49.050 --> 01:32:51.050
power to command and

01:32:51.050 --> 01:32:53.050
control the wind,

01:32:53.050 --> 01:32:55.050
to see

01:32:55.050 --> 01:32:57.050
actually all forces of nature

01:32:57.050 --> 01:32:59.050
to mankind's benefit.

01:32:59.050 --> 01:33:01.050
Under Kingdom rule

01:33:01.050 --> 01:33:03.050
there will be no

01:33:03.050 --> 01:33:05.050
destructive tsunamis,

01:33:05.050 --> 01:33:07.050
hurricanes, tornadoes,

01:33:07.050 --> 01:33:09.050
floods, earthquakes,

01:33:09.050 --> 01:33:11.050
etc., etc.

01:33:11.050 --> 01:33:13.050
But now let's identify

01:33:13.050 --> 01:33:15.050
superhuman ability number two

01:33:15.050 --> 01:33:17.050
and to do this just think

01:33:17.050 --> 01:33:19.050
about the account if you will

01:33:19.050 --> 01:33:21.050
in Matthew chapter 14.

01:33:21.050 --> 01:33:23.050
If you recall

01:33:23.050 --> 01:33:25.050
with just five

01:33:25.050 --> 01:33:27.050
loads of bread,

01:33:27.050 --> 01:33:29.050
two little fish,

01:33:29.050 --> 01:33:31.050
Jesus fed a crowd

01:33:31.050 --> 01:33:33.050
likely of over 10,000 people.

01:33:33.050 --> 01:33:35.050
If you factor in the women

01:33:35.050 --> 01:33:37.050
and children

01:33:37.050 --> 01:33:39.050
and every one of them

01:33:39.050 --> 01:33:41.050
ate to complete

01:33:41.050 --> 01:33:43.050
satisfaction,

01:33:43.050 --> 01:33:45.050
while they even gathered up

01:33:45.050 --> 01:33:47.050
12 baskets full of

01:33:47.050 --> 01:33:49.050
fragments as leftovers.

01:33:49.050 --> 01:33:51.050
Well what do we learn

01:33:51.050 --> 01:33:53.050
from this miracle?

01:33:53.050 --> 01:33:55.050
Jesus, as Messianic King,

01:33:55.050 --> 01:33:57.050
will exercise authority

01:33:57.050 --> 01:33:59.050
over the organic

01:33:59.050 --> 01:34:01.050
elements in food and vegetation.

01:34:01.050 --> 01:34:03.050
Ensuring that no one

01:34:03.050 --> 01:34:05.050
under his rule ever

01:34:05.050 --> 01:34:07.050
goes hungry,

01:34:07.050 --> 01:34:09.050
is estimated right now

01:34:09.050 --> 01:34:11.050
more than 800 million people

01:34:11.050 --> 01:34:13.050
go to bed at night hungry.

01:34:13.050 --> 01:34:15.050
That number

01:34:15.050 --> 01:34:17.050
will be reduced

01:34:17.050 --> 01:34:19.050
to zero

01:34:19.050 --> 01:34:21.050
under Kingdom rule.

01:34:21.050 --> 01:34:23.050
No one will have to go

01:34:23.050 --> 01:34:25.050
to bed hungry at night.

01:34:25.050 --> 01:34:27.050
So I'm 72-16

01:34:27.050 --> 01:34:29.050
there will be an abundance of grain

01:34:29.050 --> 01:34:31.050
on the earth. On the top

01:34:31.050 --> 01:34:33.050
of the mountains,

01:34:33.050 --> 01:34:35.050
it will overflow.

01:34:35.050 --> 01:34:37.050
And it won't be just basics.

01:34:37.050 --> 01:34:39.050
Isaiah 25-6,

01:34:39.050 --> 01:34:41.050
Jehovah of armies will make

01:34:41.050 --> 01:34:43.050
for all the peoples

01:34:43.050 --> 01:34:45.050
that means nobody left out

01:34:45.050 --> 01:34:47.050
all the peoples

01:34:47.050 --> 01:34:49.050
a banquet

01:34:49.050 --> 01:34:51.050
of rich dishes,

01:34:51.050 --> 01:34:53.050
a banquet

01:34:53.050 --> 01:34:55.050
of fine wine

01:34:55.050 --> 01:34:57.050
filtered wine.

01:34:57.050 --> 01:34:59.050
Now we're not talking about

01:34:59.050 --> 01:35:04.569
Ripple Thunderbird wine yet.

01:35:04.569 --> 01:35:06.569
We're talking about fine wine.

01:35:06.569 --> 01:35:08.569
Like Jesus made

01:35:08.569 --> 01:35:10.569
at that wedding feast

01:35:10.569 --> 01:35:12.569
in Canaan.

01:35:12.569 --> 01:35:14.569
But now, let's identify

01:35:14.569 --> 01:35:16.569
superhuman ability number three.

01:35:16.569 --> 01:35:20.569
Go please to Matthew chapter 15.

01:35:20.569 --> 01:35:22.569
Matthew 15.

01:35:22.569 --> 01:35:24.569
And let's read

01:35:24.569 --> 01:35:28.329
please verse number 30.

01:35:28.329 --> 01:35:30.329
Then large crowds

01:35:30.329 --> 01:35:32.329
approached him

01:35:32.329 --> 01:35:34.329
bringing along people

01:35:34.329 --> 01:35:36.329
who were lame,

01:35:36.329 --> 01:35:38.329
maimed, blind,

01:35:38.329 --> 01:35:40.329
speechless,

01:35:40.329 --> 01:35:42.329
and many others.

01:35:42.329 --> 01:35:44.329
And they laid them at his feet

01:35:44.329 --> 01:35:46.329
and he cured them.

01:35:46.329 --> 01:35:48.329
No, this was amazing, wasn't it?

01:35:48.329 --> 01:35:50.329
But what did these healing

01:35:50.329 --> 01:35:52.329
miracles portend

01:35:52.329 --> 01:35:54.329
for Jesus as Messianic

01:35:54.329 --> 01:35:56.329
King? Well,

01:35:56.329 --> 01:35:58.329
he will have the power

01:35:58.329 --> 01:36:00.329
and the authority

01:36:00.329 --> 01:36:02.329
to heal all

01:36:02.329 --> 01:36:04.329
sicknesses

01:36:04.329 --> 01:36:06.329
and maladies. See,

01:36:06.329 --> 01:36:08.329
any sickness, any malady

01:36:08.329 --> 01:36:10.329
he will heal. Under Kingdom rule

01:36:10.329 --> 01:36:12.329
as promised at Isaiah 33-24,

01:36:12.329 --> 01:36:14.329
no resident,

01:36:14.329 --> 01:36:16.329
not one

01:36:16.329 --> 01:36:18.329
will say, I am sick.

01:36:18.329 --> 01:36:20.329
In fact, Jesus will

01:36:20.329 --> 01:36:24.329
even have the power to put the human aging process

01:36:24.329 --> 01:36:26.329
into reverse

01:36:26.329 --> 01:36:28.329
with ones becoming

01:36:28.329 --> 01:36:30.329
young physically.

01:36:30.329 --> 01:36:32.329
Do you recall this video clip

01:36:32.329 --> 01:36:34.329
it was shown at a convention

01:36:34.329 --> 01:36:38.859
some years ago

01:36:38.859 --> 01:36:40.859
and we're not seeing

01:36:40.859 --> 01:36:44.859
in this portion of this video

01:36:44.859 --> 01:36:46.859
a fantasy.

01:36:46.859 --> 01:36:48.859
We're looking at

01:36:48.859 --> 01:36:50.859
reality.

01:36:50.859 --> 01:36:52.859
In fact, one brother said, can you imagine

01:36:52.859 --> 01:36:54.859
getting up in the morning,

01:36:54.859 --> 01:36:56.859
put your glasses on,

01:36:56.859 --> 01:36:58.859
you can't see anything.

01:36:58.859 --> 01:37:00.859
Everything's blurry.

01:37:00.859 --> 01:37:02.859
You take them off.

01:37:02.859 --> 01:37:04.859
Now you can see beautifully.

01:37:04.859 --> 01:37:06.859
Not fantasy.

01:37:06.859 --> 01:37:08.859
We're talking about reality

01:37:08.859 --> 01:37:10.859
in Jehovah's New World.

01:37:10.859 --> 01:37:12.859
But now let's identify

01:37:12.859 --> 01:37:14.859
the superhuman ability number four.

01:37:14.859 --> 01:37:16.859
And to do this, just think if you will

01:37:16.859 --> 01:37:18.859
of the account in Mark chapter five.

01:37:18.859 --> 01:37:20.859
If you recall,

01:37:20.859 --> 01:37:22.859
very sadly,

01:37:22.859 --> 01:37:24.859
heart wrenchingly,

01:37:24.859 --> 01:37:26.859
a little 12-year-old girl

01:37:26.859 --> 01:37:28.859
had died.

01:37:28.859 --> 01:37:30.859
But what did Jesus do?

01:37:30.859 --> 01:37:32.859
The account tells us he took her hand

01:37:32.859 --> 01:37:34.859
and said,

01:37:34.859 --> 01:37:36.859
little girl, I say to you,

01:37:36.859 --> 01:37:38.859
get up.

01:37:38.859 --> 01:37:40.859
That girl who had been dead

01:37:40.859 --> 01:37:42.859
immediately rose

01:37:42.859 --> 01:37:44.859
and began walking.

01:37:44.859 --> 01:37:46.859
Well, what future

01:37:46.859 --> 01:37:48.859
accomplishment is signified

01:37:48.859 --> 01:37:50.859
by this miracle?

01:37:50.859 --> 01:37:52.859
Well, Jesus and his 144,000

01:37:52.859 --> 01:37:54.859
associate kings

01:37:54.859 --> 01:37:56.859
will have the power

01:37:56.859 --> 01:37:58.859
to completely empty

01:37:58.859 --> 01:38:00.859
the grave,

01:38:00.859 --> 01:38:02.859
the common grave of dead mankind

01:38:02.859 --> 01:38:04.859
by means of the resurrection.

01:38:04.859 --> 01:38:06.859
And then, according

01:38:06.859 --> 01:38:08.859
to Revelation chapter 20 verse 14,

01:38:08.859 --> 01:38:10.859
the empty grave

01:38:10.859 --> 01:38:12.859
will be thrown into the

01:38:12.859 --> 01:38:14.859
symbolic lake of fire.

01:38:14.859 --> 01:38:16.859
It will be abolished

01:38:16.859 --> 01:38:18.859
forever, never again

01:38:18.859 --> 01:38:20.859
to receive another

01:38:20.859 --> 01:38:22.859
occupant.

01:38:22.859 --> 01:38:24.859
Well, as isolate superhuman

01:38:24.859 --> 01:38:26.859
ability number five,

01:38:26.859 --> 01:38:28.859
Matthew chapter nine, please.

01:38:28.859 --> 01:38:30.859
Turn there.

01:38:30.859 --> 01:38:34.810
Matthew chapter nine.

01:38:34.810 --> 01:38:36.810
And let's read beginning in verse number three.

01:38:36.810 --> 01:38:38.810
Matthew nine verse three.

01:38:38.810 --> 01:38:40.810
Now, certain scribes

01:38:40.810 --> 01:38:42.810
said to themselves,

01:38:42.810 --> 01:38:46.810
this fellow is blaspheming.

01:38:46.810 --> 01:38:48.810
Jesus, knowing

01:38:48.810 --> 01:38:50.810
their thought said,

01:38:50.810 --> 01:38:52.810
why are you thinking

01:38:52.810 --> 01:38:54.810
wicked things in your hearts?

01:38:54.810 --> 01:38:56.810
So notice, Jesus could

01:38:56.810 --> 01:38:58.810
read hearts

01:38:58.810 --> 01:39:00.810
there as a perfect human.

01:39:00.810 --> 01:39:02.810
What about his Messianic king?

01:39:02.810 --> 01:39:04.810
Even more so.

01:39:04.810 --> 01:39:06.810
He in 144,000

01:39:06.810 --> 01:39:08.810
will be able to read hearts.

01:39:08.810 --> 01:39:10.810
And that means what?

01:39:10.810 --> 01:39:12.810
They will be able to perfectly

01:39:12.810 --> 01:39:14.810
judge mankind

01:39:14.810 --> 01:39:16.810
with absolutely

01:39:16.810 --> 01:39:18.810
no mistakes.

01:39:18.810 --> 01:39:20.810
Amazing indeed.

01:39:20.810 --> 01:39:22.810
Well, let's determine one more

01:39:22.810 --> 01:39:24.810
a six superhuman

01:39:24.810 --> 01:39:26.810
miraculous ability

01:39:26.810 --> 01:39:28.810
that Jesus will possess

01:39:28.810 --> 01:39:30.810
and demonstrate.

01:39:30.810 --> 01:39:32.810
And we're going to do this.

01:39:32.810 --> 01:39:34.810
Let's go to Matthew chapter eight.

01:39:34.810 --> 01:39:35.810
Just back a little bit from where you were there.

01:39:35.810 --> 01:39:37.810
Matthew eight

01:39:37.810 --> 01:39:39.810
and verse number 16.

01:39:39.810 --> 01:39:41.810
But after it that came

01:39:41.810 --> 01:39:43.810
evening, people

01:39:43.810 --> 01:39:45.810
brought him

01:39:45.810 --> 01:39:47.810
many demon possessed

01:39:47.810 --> 01:39:49.810
ones.

01:39:49.810 --> 01:39:51.810
And he expelled the demons

01:39:51.810 --> 01:39:53.810
with a word.

01:39:53.810 --> 01:39:55.810
And he cured all who were suffering.

01:39:55.810 --> 01:39:57.810
So notice,

01:39:57.810 --> 01:39:59.810
rather than risk a decisive

01:39:59.810 --> 01:40:01.810
test of the power that was back in Jesus,

01:40:01.810 --> 01:40:03.810
the demons obeyed his command

01:40:03.810 --> 01:40:05.810
to release these people

01:40:05.810 --> 01:40:07.810
that they were possessing.

01:40:07.810 --> 01:40:09.810
Well, what do we learn from this?

01:40:09.810 --> 01:40:11.810
What is this prefigure?

01:40:11.810 --> 01:40:15.810
Jesus and the 144,000

01:40:15.810 --> 01:40:17.810
will have the power

01:40:17.810 --> 01:40:19.810
to act

01:40:19.810 --> 01:40:21.810
against Satan

01:40:21.810 --> 01:40:23.810
and his demons.

01:40:23.810 --> 01:40:25.810
Because Jesus even granted

01:40:25.810 --> 01:40:27.810
on the earth his disciples

01:40:27.810 --> 01:40:29.810
that same authority didn't he?

01:40:29.810 --> 01:40:31.810
They were able to expel demons.

01:40:31.810 --> 01:40:33.810
The power even more so.

01:40:33.810 --> 01:40:35.810
To take action against Satan

01:40:35.810 --> 01:40:37.810
and his demons.

01:40:37.810 --> 01:40:39.810
At the end of the thousand year

01:40:39.810 --> 01:40:41.810
or the end of the great tribulation,

01:40:41.810 --> 01:40:43.810
I should say first,

01:40:43.810 --> 01:40:45.810
they will abyss them.

01:40:45.810 --> 01:40:47.810
Then at the end of the final test

01:40:47.810 --> 01:40:49.810
at the end of the thousand years,

01:40:49.810 --> 01:40:51.810
Jesus joined

01:40:51.810 --> 01:40:53.810
by the secondary seed

01:40:53.810 --> 01:40:55.810
of Abraham

01:40:55.810 --> 01:40:57.810
as promised at Genesis 3.15.

01:40:57.810 --> 01:40:59.810
Jesus

01:40:59.810 --> 01:41:01.810
will crush

01:41:01.810 --> 01:41:03.810
the ugliest head

01:41:03.810 --> 01:41:05.810
in the universe.

01:41:05.810 --> 01:41:07.810
Satan's head.

01:41:07.810 --> 01:41:09.810
And he will crush

01:41:09.810 --> 01:41:11.810
the second ugliest heads in the universe,

01:41:11.810 --> 01:41:13.810
the heads of the demons.

01:41:13.810 --> 01:41:15.810
What a tremendous accomplishment

01:41:15.810 --> 01:41:17.810
in vindication

01:41:17.810 --> 01:41:19.810
of Jehovah's name and sovereignty

01:41:19.810 --> 01:41:21.810
that will be.

01:41:21.810 --> 01:41:23.810
Well, there we have six

01:41:23.810 --> 01:41:25.810
marvelous miraculous

01:41:25.810 --> 01:41:27.810
superhuman abilities

01:41:27.810 --> 01:41:29.810
that Jesus will possess

01:41:29.810 --> 01:41:31.810
an exercise during his reign.

01:41:31.810 --> 01:41:33.810
Human rulers,

01:41:33.810 --> 01:41:35.810
if we think about it,

01:41:35.810 --> 01:41:37.810
couldn't even dream

01:41:37.810 --> 01:41:39.810
to ever possess

01:41:39.810 --> 01:41:41.810
even one of those superhuman

01:41:41.810 --> 01:41:43.810
abilities.

01:41:43.810 --> 01:41:45.810
But Jesus will be able to one

01:41:45.810 --> 01:41:47.810
command and control the forces

01:41:47.810 --> 01:41:49.810
of nature

01:41:49.810 --> 01:41:51.810
to the benefit of all humans.

01:41:51.810 --> 01:41:53.810
Two, exercise authority

01:41:53.810 --> 01:41:55.810
over food and vegetation

01:41:55.810 --> 01:41:57.810
ensuring that no one ever

01:41:57.810 --> 01:41:59.810
goes hungry.

01:41:59.810 --> 01:42:01.810
Three, possess the power to heal all

01:42:01.810 --> 01:42:03.810
sicknesses and malities.

01:42:03.810 --> 01:42:05.810
Four, have the capability

01:42:05.810 --> 01:42:07.810
to completely empty the grave

01:42:07.810 --> 01:42:09.810
by means

01:42:09.810 --> 01:42:11.810
of the resurrection.

01:42:11.810 --> 01:42:13.810
Five, possess

01:42:13.810 --> 01:42:15.810
the ability to perfectly

01:42:15.810 --> 01:42:17.810
judge humans

01:42:17.810 --> 01:42:19.810
with absolutely no mistakes.

01:42:19.810 --> 01:42:21.810
Number six,

01:42:21.810 --> 01:42:23.810
be empowered

01:42:23.810 --> 01:42:25.810
to act against satan

01:42:25.810 --> 01:42:27.810
and his demons.

01:42:27.810 --> 01:42:29.810
And if you think about it,

01:42:29.810 --> 01:42:31.810
the four going

01:42:31.810 --> 01:42:33.810
are only a few examples

01:42:33.810 --> 01:42:35.810
of the superhuman royal power

01:42:35.810 --> 01:42:37.810
that Jesus will possess

01:42:37.810 --> 01:42:39.810
as Messianic king.

01:42:39.810 --> 01:42:41.810
No wonder

01:42:41.810 --> 01:42:43.810
he's Jehovah's choice.

01:42:43.810 --> 01:42:45.810
And no wonder

01:42:45.810 --> 01:42:47.810
Jehovah has issued the decree

01:42:47.810 --> 01:42:49.810
that all, not optional,

01:42:49.810 --> 01:42:51.810
all must kiss

01:42:51.810 --> 01:42:53.810
his son.

01:42:53.810 --> 01:42:55.810
Now, it's true,

01:42:55.810 --> 01:42:57.810
a kiss can be hypocritical,

01:42:57.810 --> 01:42:59.810
can it?

01:42:59.810 --> 01:43:01.810
You know,

01:43:01.810 --> 01:43:03.810
Absalom gave out many

01:43:03.810 --> 01:43:05.810
probably better say,

01:43:05.810 --> 01:43:07.810
gave off many hypocritical kisses.

01:43:07.810 --> 01:43:09.810
He was kissing everybody,

01:43:09.810 --> 01:43:11.810
wasn't he?

01:43:11.810 --> 01:43:13.810
hypocritical.

01:43:13.810 --> 01:43:15.810
We read the account

01:43:15.810 --> 01:43:17.810
Treacher's Joab,

01:43:17.810 --> 01:43:19.810
hypocritically kissed Amesa

01:43:19.810 --> 01:43:23.810
and by means of a disgusting

01:43:23.810 --> 01:43:25.810
hypocritical, quote,

01:43:25.810 --> 01:43:27.810
tender kiss

01:43:27.810 --> 01:43:29.810
Judas betrayed Jesus.

01:43:29.810 --> 01:43:31.810
But brothers and sisters,

01:43:31.810 --> 01:43:33.810
our kiss of Jesus

01:43:33.810 --> 01:43:35.810
is not hypocritical.

01:43:35.810 --> 01:43:37.810
From the bottom of our heart

01:43:37.810 --> 01:43:39.810
by our conduct,

01:43:39.810 --> 01:43:41.810
by our words,

01:43:41.810 --> 01:43:43.810
we warmly welcome

01:43:43.810 --> 01:43:45.810
Jehovah's choice, don't we?

01:43:45.810 --> 01:43:47.810
We're so happy,

01:43:47.810 --> 01:43:49.810
about this, that he is already

01:43:49.810 --> 01:43:51.810
installed as king,

01:43:51.810 --> 01:43:53.810
and he will soon be the ruler

01:43:53.810 --> 01:43:55.810
for all the earth.

01:43:55.810 --> 01:43:57.810
And we want to help honest hearted ones

01:43:57.810 --> 01:43:59.810
to likewise,

01:43:59.810 --> 01:44:01.810
sincerely, affectionately,

01:44:01.810 --> 01:44:03.810
kiss welcome God's son.

01:44:03.810 --> 01:44:05.810
We do this urgently

01:44:05.810 --> 01:44:07.810
during the limited

01:44:07.810 --> 01:44:09.810
window of time,

01:44:09.810 --> 01:44:11.810
during this kiss God's son

01:44:11.810 --> 01:44:13.810
invitation time period.

01:44:13.810 --> 01:44:15.810
Before,

01:44:15.810 --> 01:44:17.810
time period arrives

01:44:17.810 --> 01:44:19.810
when ones will be told

01:44:19.810 --> 01:44:21.810
get ready to meet

01:44:21.810 --> 01:44:23.810
your God.

01:44:23.810 --> 01:44:25.810
Of course, sadly,

01:44:25.810 --> 01:44:27.810
as we know the vast majority,

01:44:27.810 --> 01:44:29.810
especially the rulers,

01:44:29.810 --> 01:44:31.810
will adamantly continue

01:44:31.810 --> 01:44:33.810
to do so.

01:44:33.810 --> 01:44:35.810
But we are not like them

01:44:35.810 --> 01:44:37.810
because these ones,

01:44:37.810 --> 01:44:39.810
the anger of Jehovah and Jesus

01:44:39.810 --> 01:44:41.810
will blaze against them.

01:44:41.810 --> 01:44:43.810
But made Jehovah richly

01:44:43.810 --> 01:44:45.810
dear brothers and sisters,

01:44:45.810 --> 01:44:47.810
as you continue

01:44:47.810 --> 01:44:49.810
to affectionately,

01:44:49.810 --> 01:44:51.810
warmly welcome

01:44:51.810 --> 01:44:53.810
Jehovah's choice,

01:44:53.810 --> 01:44:55.810
and as you work hard

01:44:55.810 --> 01:44:57.810
to help other honest hearted ones

01:44:57.810 --> 01:44:59.810
to do the same.

01:44:59.810 --> 01:45:10.770
Well, that was very

01:45:10.770 --> 01:45:12.770
encouraging, wasn't it?

01:45:12.770 --> 01:45:14.770
And I think we can say

01:45:14.770 --> 01:45:16.770
that Jehovah has been very good

01:45:16.770 --> 01:45:18.770
to us today.

01:45:18.770 --> 01:45:20.770
Jehovah has given us the

01:45:20.770 --> 01:45:22.770
encouragement that

01:45:22.770 --> 01:45:24.770
we've all desperately needed.

01:45:24.770 --> 01:45:26.770
And so if you felt encouraged

01:45:26.770 --> 01:45:28.770
by this program,

01:45:28.770 --> 01:45:30.770
thank Jehovah for it.

01:45:30.770 --> 01:45:32.770
And we're also grateful,

01:45:32.770 --> 01:45:34.770
not only to the brothers

01:45:34.770 --> 01:45:36.770
who have presented parts on the program,

01:45:36.770 --> 01:45:38.770
but we think of the many

01:45:38.770 --> 01:45:40.770
who worked tirelessly

01:45:40.770 --> 01:45:42.770
behind the scenes,

01:45:42.770 --> 01:45:44.770
preparing all those videos.

01:45:44.770 --> 01:45:46.770
As I was watching all that,

01:45:46.770 --> 01:45:48.770
I was thinking what a

01:45:48.770 --> 01:45:50.770
great way to do it.

01:45:50.770 --> 01:45:52.770
But yet,

01:45:52.770 --> 01:45:54.770
how can you replace a video?

01:45:54.770 --> 01:45:56.770
The vision,

01:45:56.770 --> 01:45:58.770
the visibility of it,

01:45:58.770 --> 01:46:00.770
it just makes so much more

01:46:00.770 --> 01:46:02.770
meaningful for us.

01:46:02.770 --> 01:46:04.770
So we're grateful for the brothers

01:46:04.770 --> 01:46:06.770
who do all of this work.

01:46:06.770 --> 01:46:08.770
Jehovah never disappoints.

01:46:08.770 --> 01:46:10.770
Throughout this annual meeting program,

01:46:10.770 --> 01:46:12.770
we've seen how he instructs us

01:46:12.770 --> 01:46:14.770
personally,

01:46:14.770 --> 01:46:16.770
cares for us during crises,

01:46:16.770 --> 01:46:18.770
and satisfies us

01:46:18.770 --> 01:46:20.770
with meaningful work.

01:46:20.770 --> 01:46:22.770
How fitting it is then

01:46:22.770 --> 01:46:24.770
that the year text for 2023

01:46:24.770 --> 01:46:26.770
praises the God

01:46:26.770 --> 01:46:28.770
whose actions and words

01:46:28.770 --> 01:46:30.770
are the essence of truth.

01:46:30.770 --> 01:46:32.770
Before we conclude,

01:46:32.770 --> 01:46:34.770
let's go to Bangladesh.

01:46:34.770 --> 01:46:36.770
A land filled with

01:46:36.770 --> 01:46:38.770
unique features.

01:46:38.770 --> 01:46:40.770
It has the largest

01:46:40.770 --> 01:46:42.770
contiguous mangrove forest

01:46:42.770 --> 01:46:44.770
in the world,

01:46:44.770 --> 01:46:46.770
dreaming with interesting creatures.

01:46:46.770 --> 01:46:48.770
The plant life is amazing as well.

01:46:48.770 --> 01:46:52.770
Bangladesh is also home

01:46:52.770 --> 01:46:54.770
to Jackfruit.

01:46:54.770 --> 01:46:56.770
This sweet, nutritious treat

01:46:56.770 --> 01:46:58.770
is the world's largest fruit

01:46:58.770 --> 01:47:00.770
grown on trees.

01:47:00.770 --> 01:47:02.770
One piece of fruit

01:47:02.770 --> 01:47:04.770
can weigh over 40 pounds

01:47:04.770 --> 01:47:06.770
or 18 kilograms.

01:47:06.770 --> 01:47:08.770
Three rivers,

01:47:08.770 --> 01:47:10.770
the Jamuna,

01:47:10.770 --> 01:47:12.770
the Potta,

01:47:12.770 --> 01:47:14.770
and the Magna,

01:47:14.770 --> 01:47:16.770
combined to form

01:47:16.770 --> 01:47:18.770
the world's largest river delta.

01:47:18.770 --> 01:47:20.770
Here along the bay

01:47:20.770 --> 01:47:22.770
lies much of the country's

01:47:22.770 --> 01:47:24.770
population,

01:47:24.770 --> 01:47:26.770
who depend on its rich resources

01:47:26.770 --> 01:47:28.770
for survival.

01:47:28.770 --> 01:47:30.770
Spiritually speaking,

01:47:30.770 --> 01:47:32.770
the land is also full of potential.

01:47:32.770 --> 01:47:34.770
Bengali is the seventh most spoken

01:47:34.770 --> 01:47:36.770
language in the world.

01:47:36.770 --> 01:47:38.770
There's a ratio of more than

01:47:38.770 --> 01:47:40.770
half a million people

01:47:40.770 --> 01:47:42.770
published here.

01:47:42.770 --> 01:47:44.770
Among those answering the call

01:47:44.770 --> 01:47:46.770
to preach are zealous young ones.

01:47:46.770 --> 01:47:48.770
They skillfully use the Bible

01:47:48.770 --> 01:47:50.770
to show how it promises relief.

01:47:50.770 --> 01:47:52.770
They put to full use

01:47:52.770 --> 01:47:54.770
the recently released Bengali edition

01:47:54.770 --> 01:47:56.770
of the New World Translation

01:47:56.770 --> 01:47:58.770
of the Christian Greek Scriptures.

01:47:58.770 --> 01:48:00.770
These young ones

01:48:00.770 --> 01:48:02.770
also love to encourage

01:48:02.770 --> 01:48:04.770
their brothers and sisters

01:48:04.770 --> 01:48:06.770
with song and dance

01:48:06.770 --> 01:48:08.770
and drawings of Jehovah's creation,

01:48:08.770 --> 01:48:10.770
such as the Native Bengal Tiger.

01:48:10.770 --> 01:48:12.770
It's wonderful

01:48:12.770 --> 01:48:14.770
when a congregation

01:48:14.770 --> 01:48:16.770
that's so diverse in age,

01:48:16.770 --> 01:48:18.770
ethnicity, and background

01:48:18.770 --> 01:48:20.770
can worship, eat,

01:48:20.770 --> 01:48:22.770
and play together.

01:48:22.770 --> 01:48:24.770
The Shadjapur congregation

01:48:24.770 --> 01:48:26.770
is just such a group.

01:48:26.770 --> 01:48:28.770
And it's 69 publishers

01:48:28.770 --> 01:48:30.770
warmly say to you all,

01:48:30.770 --> 01:48:34.770
Amra Apnadar Parloboshi,

01:48:34.770 --> 01:48:36.770
which means we love you.

01:48:36.770 --> 01:48:38.770
From the World Headquarters

01:48:38.770 --> 01:48:40.770
of Jehovah's Witnesses,

01:48:40.770 --> 01:48:42.770
this is JW Broadcasting.
