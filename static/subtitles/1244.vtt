After the stroke, it feels like every day there's just another reminder of what I can't do.

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:47.150
I wish Jehovah would just give me my strength back.

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:54.750
Carl mentioned he's been dealing with health issues for years. So I asked him what helps him keep

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:00.109
going. He said his favorite scripture is 1 Thessalonians 517.

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:10.080
Pray constantly. He said Jehovah was there in the good times, and he's still there in the bad.

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:23.409
In prayer, he shares all his struggles, many of which only Jehovah can understand, but prayer

00:02:23.409 --> 00:03:01.250
gives him strength. Pray constantly.
