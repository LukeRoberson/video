00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:08.119
On April 20, 2017, the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation criminalized the activity

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:18.570
of Jehovah's Witnesses. As of July 4, 2019, authorities have progressively seized 131

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.370
of the properties owned by Jehovah's Witnesses, with an additional 60 properties subject

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:27.929
to confiscation. One of the seized properties was the former Russia branch complex in

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:34.100
the Solarish Neuer. At the time of filming, the Russian authorities continued their

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:41.140
aggressive attack on Jehovah's Witnesses. As of August 17, 2020, there were 42 witnesses

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:47.780
who were in pre-trial detention or sentenced to prison people, 32 who were under house arrest,

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:53.820
and 169 who were not allowed to leave their home town. All have been charged with organising,

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:00.780
participating in or financing the activity of so-called extremist organisation. At least

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:09.540
380 witnesses were at the time under investigation, ranging in age from 19 to 89 years old.

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:16.620
What is this meant for the individuals affected? As an example, on June 3, 2018, whether

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:23.420
Sergei Klimov was arrested, local authorities initiated criminal charges against him, placing

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:30.579
him in pre-trial detention for two months. This detention was extended seven times, separating

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:35.659
him from his wife and family for a year and five months before he was finally tried and

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:48.579
sentenced. On November 5, 2019, he was sentenced to six years in prison. Two of our dear young

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:53.980
people in Russia, brother Yegor Baranov and sister Daria Dolovar, are courageously facing

00:01:53.980 --> 00:02:00.140
criminal conviction and potential long-term imprisonment. Brother Baranov is only 19 years

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:09.099
old. When the authorities raided her home, sister Dolovar was only 18 years old. By means

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:14.060
of the newsroom on JWWorg, we're informed of updated news events. This page includes

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.539
links to name lists of witnesses currently in prison for their faith, which can help us

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:24.340
include them specifically in our prayers. Our brothers and sisters in Russia are resolved

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.900
to remain loyal to Jehovah, despite any opposition, and they put their confidence in him

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.020
in the assurance that Jehovah is on their side.
