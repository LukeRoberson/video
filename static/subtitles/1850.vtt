00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:10.660
My husband contracted COVID-19. He was brought to the ICU, and to this later, he passed away.

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:20.760
We were unable to say goodbye. We weren't able to see each other. We were unable to have our last conversation.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:31.100
My husband and I got sick in the month of March 2020, and then my husband fell asleep in death.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:40.100
Isolation can make you depressed. I would say that was the worst time of my life.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:49.100
My husband contracted COVID and he was breathing heavily, so I called 911.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:01:01.200
The ambulance took him and on the way to the hospital, his heart stopped.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:12.200
My bank account was blocked. I had debts, I had COVID, and the landlord gave me a week to leave the house.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:20.200
My husband used to do everything, and now it's my responsibility to be the spiritual head of the family.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:30.200
I need help. The elders helped me prepare for family worship. That's exactly what we needed at that moment.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:42.200
There were times I felt dejected and weak. The sisters really helped me by showing personal interest.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.200
In fact, not a day went by without them calling me.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:56.200
I was feeling tired without strength. I felt helpless, so the friends took care of the entire move.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:05.200
I helped to clean the house and helped me out financially. They were like my arms and legs. They supported me.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.199
I felt like my spiritual family was carrying me in their arms.

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:22.199
Everything that my brother and sister did for me during that difficult time, the messages, the postcards, the flowers, that shows me the kind of family that I have.

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:33.199
That's what the kids really needed to see, that we were not alone, that our friends were there, even though they couldn't be here physically with us.

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:46.500
The brothers have encouraged me in so many ways, from letters from pioneer spread all over Italy.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:03:01.500
To video calls, phone calls, and messages, I realized that there will always be someone to hope it uses to comfort me.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:09.500
Before I felt weak and powerless, Jehovah gave me strength. He helped me by means of the brothers.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:36.520
The day after my husband died, I was so surprised when I opened the door, our friends started singing for us.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:42.520
At that moment, I realized we're not going to be alone. We have our spiritual family.

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:52.520
I began to speak to Jehovah more intensely, before I would talk to my husband about everything.

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:57.520
Now, I share my problems and anxieties with Jehovah.

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:07.520
I've been keeping a little journal of everything that Jehovah has done for us, and I write it down because I want to be able to tell my husband when I say him again.

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:15.520
I didn't feel alone at any time. I felt that I belonged to a family that was caring for me and supporting me.

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:22.519
I really saw Jehovah's love and the help he gives.

00:04:22.519 --> 00:04:28.519
He could do anything to help you feel better when you go into trials.

00:04:28.519 --> 00:04:36.519
Saying Jehovah's support for me by means of the brothers makes me feel secure, thinking about how he will support me in the future.

00:04:36.519 --> 00:04:44.519
I can say that in the future, I am absolutely certain that Jehovah will be with me.

00:04:44.519 --> 00:04:55.519
There's no pandemic. There's no bad situation that will prevent Jehovah to reach anyone when they're going through trials.
