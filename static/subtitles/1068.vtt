00:00:01.389 --> 00:00:04.389
Are you tired of being tired?

00:00:04.389 --> 00:00:07.389
Are you sick of being sick?

00:00:07.389 --> 00:00:12.390
Many of us are feeling the impact of living in this old system of things.

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:14.390
But what can we do?

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:19.390
Well, we try to improve our health or find some relief by medical means,

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:25.390
or improving our diet, exercise, and getting more rest.

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:30.390
But the bottom line is, we are infected with sin.

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.390
And with sin comes sickness and the effects of aging.

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.390
There's promise after promise, but are they really true?

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:51.390
There is no pill, medicine, diet or exercise program that can give us complete relief, removal of sickness,

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.390
or what we really want and what we need, perfect health.

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:02.390
But there is a promise recorded in God's Word that does give us confidence.

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.390
Let's read this together at Isaiah chapter 33.

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:14.390
Isaiah 33, and notice the reassuring words from Jehovah through the prophet Isaiah in verse 24.

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:21.390
And there it says, and no resident, no one will say, I am sick.

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.390
The people dwelling in the land will be pardoned for their error.

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.390
So sin will be removed in God's new world.

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.390
Do you believe that?

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.390
Can we really put faith in Jehovah's promise?

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:42.390
Yes, this is not just another empty promise by a human.

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.390
This comes from our creator, Jehovah.

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.390
Yes, he can guarantee it.

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:55.390
But what can we do today to build up our faith in those promises?

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:02.390
Well, as highlighted in this symposium, we can take the time and stop to look at Jehovah's creation.

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.390
So let's do that right now.

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:10.389
Let's examine the human body and its amazing ability to repair itself.

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:13.389
Please watch the following video.

00:02:13.389 --> 00:02:24.069
Our bones are amazing.

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:37.979
They support our bodies, protect our organs, and store almost all of the bodies calcium,

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:43.740
a mineral essential for our health.

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.740
For their weight, bones are very strong.

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:57.900
The feats of a track and field jumper may experience forces of several times his body weight.

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:11.650
Bones can compress and bend, but sometimes they break.

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.650
A fractured bone can heal well, if properly said.

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.650
Inflination brings organic building blocks to the area,

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:28.599
and soft tissue grows between the broken pieces.

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:34.419
The soft tissue is replaced with harder tissue.

00:03:34.419 --> 00:03:41.419
The body replaces the harder tissue with new bone, until the repair is complete.

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:53.629
In children, the break may heal without leaving a trace.

00:03:53.629 --> 00:04:01.629
Jehovah gave every bone in our body this incredible ability to heal.

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:16.129
I praise you because in an awe-inspiring way, I am wonderfully made.

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:18.129
Well, that was an amazing video.

00:04:18.129 --> 00:04:21.129
We learned a lot about what happens on the inside.

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:28.129
We take it for granted that when we get a cut, broken bone, that our body automatically heals itself.

00:04:28.129 --> 00:04:34.129
King David was very impressed with the way that he was made and the way the human body works.

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:42.129
But he did not have the modern technology and knowledge that we have today, an X-ray machine, or a microscope.

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:50.129
But he observed Jehovah's creation, and he knew that we were designed in an awe-inspiring way.

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:57.410
Let's read what he says at Psalm 139, Psalm 139, verse 14.

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:00.410
I'm sure you feel the same way.

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:07.410
He says, I praise you because in an awe-inspiring way, I am wonderfully made.

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:10.410
Your works are wonderful.

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:14.410
I know this very well.

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:21.410
So what helped David to build a strong faith in Jehovah and his promises for the future?

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:25.410
Well, did you read there? He says, I know this very well.

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:31.410
David took the time to stop and observe Jehovah's creations.

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:35.410
That's what helped him to put faith in Jehovah.

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:43.410
Yes, he took the time, not to be distracted by other things going around him, but to observe Jehovah's creations.

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:48.410
That's what inspired him, and that's what motivated him to give praise to Jehovah.

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:50.410
And we need to do the same.

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:56.410
Yes, we are far from the perfect health and life that Jehovah had intended for the future.

00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:00.410
But even so, we are made in an awe-inspiring way.

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:04.410
Jehovah wants us to continue living. It's plain to see.

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:12.410
And as we saw in the video, our bodies are amazing that they can continue to repair themselves, even without a conscious thought.

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:15.410
But therein lies the problem.

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:22.410
We could be so busy with our lives that we don't stop and take that time to have a thought.

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:27.410
Why did Jehovah make this? Why did he create me the way he did?

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:34.410
Yes, we're busy thinking about how we'll care for our families, pay the bills, or maybe take care of our health.

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:41.410
But like David, we need to stop, pause, think deeply about what Jehovah has made.

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:50.410
Don't miss out on an opportunity to be inspired like David, with all the inspiring creations around us.

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:57.410
And think about this. If Jehovah could create our bodies with the ability to repair themselves like we saw in the video,

00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:07.410
he can certainly heal all infirmities. He can reverse the aging process, and he can prevent sickness in his new world.

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:17.410
While on earth, Jesus proved with the power he was given from Jehovah that he could cure every sort of disease and every sort of infirmity.

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:30.410
Every sort meant everything from healing the blind, the lame, those with epilepsy, leprosy, to raising the dead to life.

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:35.410
That truly is an amazing thing to ponder.

00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:38.410
Now that must have been an amazing thing to see back then.

00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:51.410
But what Jesus did was just a preview on a small scale of what he will do in the future worldwide on a large scale under God's kingdom arrangement during the millennium.

00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:58.410
We will finally see that promise we read in Isaiah that no resident will say, I am sick, why?

00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:05.410
Because Jesus will use his kingly power to bring about perfect health, yes, lasting health.

00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:23.410
Jehovah's promises, they fill us with hope, they fill us with confidence, that every sort of disease and illness, anything that we're going through now, it's only temporary knowing that permanent, perfect health is soon to come.

00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:32.409
This symposium has considered examples ranging from the heavens all the way to the inner workings of our amazing bodies.

00:08:33.409 --> 00:08:40.409
Jehovah left his imprint on all of his creations, the evidence is clearly seen, it's evident.

00:08:40.409 --> 00:08:47.409
What must we do today to build our faith and confidence in Jehovah's promises?

00:08:47.409 --> 00:08:52.409
Notice what Romans chapter 1 and verse 20 has to say.

00:08:55.899 --> 00:09:05.899
They're in verse 20, Romans 1 and verse 20, for his invisible qualities are clearly seen from the world's creation onward, why?

00:09:05.899 --> 00:09:15.899
Because they are perceived by the things made, even his eternal power and Godship, so that they are inexcusable.

00:09:15.899 --> 00:09:18.899
Let's focus in on the word perceived.

00:09:18.899 --> 00:09:30.899
It's interesting that the study note says that perceived means more than just seeing something with our literal eyes, it means grasping or understanding with our mind.

00:09:30.899 --> 00:09:37.899
One Bible translation says God's qualities are visible to the eye of reason, that's interesting.

00:09:37.899 --> 00:09:47.899
So when we see Jehovah's creations, take the time like David did to stop and think deeply, meditate on what we can learn from that creation.

00:09:47.899 --> 00:09:50.899
What it tells us about our Creator, Jehovah?

00:09:50.899 --> 00:09:58.899
What happens when we perceive Jehovah's wisdom, his power, his justice, his love and creations?

00:09:58.899 --> 00:10:04.899
It strengthens our faith and his promises now, as well as in the future.

00:10:04.899 --> 00:10:16.899
May we always be inspired and stay inspired by Jehovah's all-inspiring creations, and thus we will always be inspired by our Almighty God and Creator, Jehovah.
