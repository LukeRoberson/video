00:00:33.939 --> 00:00:42.369
About every two or three minutes we prayed because the hurricane was so terrifying.

00:00:42.369 --> 00:00:47.090
Imagine your house just lifted up into the air and flew away.

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:56.109
At that time, we were standing in order, so we just ran.

00:00:56.109 --> 00:00:58.390
This is our kingdom hall.

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:03.670
When we saw that it was damaged, we were deeply affected because we realized we could not

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.750
meet here anymore with our brothers and sisters to sympathize with them.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:16.849
That was very hard for us.

00:01:16.849 --> 00:01:20.849
Even in this situation, I know we're not alone.

00:01:20.849 --> 00:01:25.170
Even though our town was destroyed, I know our brothers, no matter where they are, will

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:34.140
come to help us.

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.900
The priority of disaster relief is for the Branch Committee to quickly appoint qualified

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:44.379
local brothers, respond to the first immediate needs of our brothers and sisters.

00:01:44.379 --> 00:01:49.700
Of course, given support to our brothers and sisters, oftentimes means funds.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:58.540
So it's the worldwide brotherhood, the Matthew 24-14 contributions that really do help.

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.379
Here in Haiti, many brothers are overjoyed that they can send something to help their

00:02:02.379 --> 00:02:04.099
brothers.

00:02:04.099 --> 00:02:15.039
There are brothers who have even donated beyond their means.

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:20.360
In our brotherhood, no matter where our brother is, if he is suffering from a disaster

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:26.319
or he has a problem, all the brothers feel as if they are also facing that problem.

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:38.009
We all do our best to support and help them.

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:40.969
We didn't have any way to make a bed to lie down.

00:02:40.969 --> 00:02:44.770
Eventually, our sisters in the Pian congregation helped us out.

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:49.449
They ran up and made beds for us out of plywood that they would put on top of eight blocks,

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:52.729
and they brought sheets and pillows so that we could lie down.

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:54.770
That was very touching.

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:58.889
That kind deed our brothers did for us.

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:06.849
We truly felt that it was Jehovah coming to our aid at that moment.

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:12.689
They brought boxes of vivals, medical kits, food stuff, and besides that, they brought

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:15.129
several tents.

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:20.550
That helped the brothers that lost all that they had.

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:29.909
So that they could have shelter from the rain.

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:34.229
In one of the talks given by a governing body member, he showed that we have more difficult

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:36.229
situations ahead.

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:42.379
The only thing we can do is continue to rely on Jehovah.

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:46.620
A way we can help our brothers cope when they are in such a circumstance is to make them

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:53.659
realize that the kingdom hope, to refresh their memory, to make them really believe and

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:59.500
feel that it's the kingdom hope that's going to change all this.

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.860
They shared encouraging words in red Bible verses that really helped us to see the power

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:05.860
of God's word.

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:10.740
And that boosted our faith in the promises Jehovah made to remove all causes of suffering

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:17.740
that afflict us today.

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:23.339
Just like the Bible says, a righteous man's supplication has a powerful effect.

00:04:23.339 --> 00:04:28.060
So the strength I regain makes me feel that the entire worldwide brotherhood is praying

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.060
for me.

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.459
I feel that it's that strength that has allowed me to resume my theocratic activities

00:04:33.459 --> 00:04:36.519
with zeal.

00:04:36.519 --> 00:04:40.439
As Jehovah's Witnesses, not only do we know that these things must take place since we

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:46.920
are deep in the last days, but we also know that our deliverance is closer.

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:49.279
I lost my livelihood.

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:55.519
It's all completely gone, but I've been so encouraged as if the hurricane never even

00:04:55.519 --> 00:04:56.519
happened.

00:04:56.519 --> 00:05:01.279
That's how I feel like it never even happened.

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:05.439
Many people say it would have been better if they died in the hurricane, but no matter

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:08.839
what sufferings we endure, we have hope.

00:05:08.839 --> 00:05:12.519
We see beyond the suffering as see God's kingdom is coming.

00:05:12.519 --> 00:05:14.000
This is extraordinary.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.879
No matter what form suffering may take, we are

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:21.759
able to patiently endure because we know that suffering will not last forever.
