00:00:01.679 --> 00:00:08.259
I'm sorry.

00:00:08.259 --> 00:00:11.259
Are you okay?

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:13.259
Are you okay?

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.259
Or are you okay?

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:23.820
Today started out well.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.820
But after the meeting tonight,

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.820
my feelings were hurt.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:38.500
Earlier in the week,

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.500
we invited some friends over to watch a movie.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:42.500
And apparently,

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.500
this new young elder heard about it.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.500
So he counseled me about it after the meeting,

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.500
saying I should give my movie choices some thought.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.500
I just didn't like the way he gave the counsel.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.500
He's only 27th.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:05.680
That's too young.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.680
The next day we had plans to go out in the ministry

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.730
with Brother Kong in his wife.

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:28.340
But the motivation just wasn't there.

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.340
I asked to speak with Brother Kong alone.

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.340
I told him what happened

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.340
and how we didn't feel the counsel applied to us.

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.340
I can understand how you might feel.

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:41.340
But be young too.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.340
Be absolutely honest with me.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.340
Do you feel there is no valid reason for that counsel?

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:59.180
Or maybe there were some scenes

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.180
that could have been less violent.

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.180
But the way he gave the counsel,

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.180
he didn't even ask how we felt.

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.180
Young Su, what is the only way

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:12.180
for us to receive perfect counsel?

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.180
From a perfect man.

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.180
That's right.

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.419
And is Jesus here on the earth today?

00:02:20.419 --> 00:02:22.419
He was right.

00:02:22.419 --> 00:02:24.419
Counsel can only be perfect.

00:02:24.419 --> 00:02:28.419
If it's given from a perfect person.

00:02:28.419 --> 00:02:32.419
Still, this counsel about our movie choices

00:02:32.419 --> 00:02:35.419
would have been so much easier.

00:02:35.419 --> 00:02:41.960
If it came from someone older and more experienced like Brother Kong.

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.960
Well, he must have sensed what I was thinking.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:53.009
Because he helped me to remember something from the Bible.

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:55.009
When Job underwent severe trials,

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:58.009
it was the younger Alayhu who helped Job

00:02:58.009 --> 00:03:02.930
adjust his thinking correctly.

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.930
It required humility on Job's part

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:11.750
to listen to someone younger and less experienced.

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.750
He then read Proverbs chapter 19 verse 20.

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.750
Listen to counsel and accept discipline

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:24.509
in order to become wise in your future.

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:26.509
The point was clear.

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:29.509
Keep our focus on the counsel,

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:31.509
not the counselor.

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:48.889
I later shared Brother Kong's comments with my wife.

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:55.300
We both realized we should welcome all counsel from Jehovah.

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:18.480
It's for our good.

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.480
I'm sure it took courage for that young elder

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.480
to approach me about the matter.

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.480
But I'm so glad he did.

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.480
Because in the end,

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:34.480
his counsel was just another example of God's love.
