00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:03.879
I'd like to start off by asking you a question.

00:00:03.879 --> 00:00:08.880
Have you ever experienced that shock, that disappointment,

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.880
of hearing that someone you love and respect has just been disfellowshipped?

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.879
And you're shocked because you think how could that have ever happened?

00:00:19.879 --> 00:00:24.879
This person seemed such a pillar, so strong in the truth,

00:00:24.879 --> 00:00:27.879
and yet now they're disfellowshipped.

00:00:27.879 --> 00:00:32.880
Well, if we've experienced that, perhaps we feel a little bit like a soldier

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.880
in a battle, in the middle of a war, when the man next to him gets shot.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:43.880
We see how easy it is for someone to fall aside from the truth.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.880
But still, we are left with that question, aren't we?

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.880
How did this happen?

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.880
Well, the watchtower made a very interesting comment back in 2001,

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.880
it was in the December 1st issue.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.880
And I'd like to read it to you, it says,

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:04.879
often what appears to be a sudden spiritual disaster turns out to have been the result

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:11.879
of a long secret history of indulgence in such spiritually damaging pursuits

00:01:11.879 --> 00:01:16.879
as, viewing pornography, being excessively concerned with material things

00:01:16.879 --> 00:01:21.879
or striving for prominence or power.

00:01:21.879 --> 00:01:25.879
Yes, as the watchtower says, perhaps at times,

00:01:25.879 --> 00:01:31.879
this is just the result of something that has gone on secretly for a long time.

00:01:31.879 --> 00:01:37.879
So, doesn't that highlight to us the need for us to examine continually

00:01:37.879 --> 00:01:40.879
how we're going with regard to our spirituality?

00:01:40.879 --> 00:01:45.879
Let's have a look at a scripture together in the book of Hebrews.

00:01:45.879 --> 00:01:49.879
It's Hebrews chapter 4 and verse 12.

00:01:49.879 --> 00:01:53.879
And notice, please, what this tells us.

00:01:53.879 --> 00:01:55.879
Hebrews 4.12.

00:01:55.879 --> 00:02:01.879
For the word of God is alive and exerts power and is sharper than any two-edged sword.

00:02:01.879 --> 00:02:07.879
And pierces even to the dividing of soul and spirit and of joints from the marrow

00:02:07.879 --> 00:02:13.879
and is able to discern the thoughts and intentions of the heart.

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:17.879
Now, this is a very powerful point for us to think about that

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:22.879
by delving into God's Word and allowing the power of God's Word to help us.

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:27.879
We can see even what we really are inside.

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:31.879
In fact, many languages don't have specific words for soul and spirit

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:35.879
and oftentimes they have to translate just the many of this

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:41.879
and I'll translate it as pierces even to see the difference between

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:46.879
what we appear to be outside and what we really are inside.

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:49.879
Well, that captures the thought behind it, doesn't it?

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:54.879
We need to be concerned about not just what's happening outside,

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:59.879
but are we developing properly as Christians inside?

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:05.879
If we turn to the book of Chronicles 1 Chronicles chapter 28,

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:11.879
we'll notice there the words of wisdom that were conveyed to Solomon by David

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:14.879
in 1 Chronicles 28, verse 9.

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:18.879
And you, Solomon, my son, know the God of your father

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:23.879
and serve him with a complete heart or an undivided heart

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:26.879
and with a delightful soul.

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:29.879
Put your hover searches through all hearts

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:34.879
and he discerns every inclination of the thoughts.

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:37.879
So as in the case we mentioned at the outset,

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:40.879
perhaps the person that we knew and respected

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:45.879
from outward appearances may have been doing all the necessary things

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:49.879
but inwardly it was a different story.

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:52.879
But we need to recognize that that's something that could happen

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:55.879
and that's why we need to pray as the Psalmist did,

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:59.879
as recorded in Psalm 86 and verse 11,

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:03.879
that the Psalmist said, instruct me of Jehovah about your way.

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:09.879
I will walk in your truth, unify my heart to fear your name.

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:13.879
And notice the footnote there, ununify my heart,

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:17.879
says, give me an undivided heart.

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:21.879
So for each one of us being conscious of the fact that

00:04:21.879 --> 00:04:23.879
if we're standing we could also fall,

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:27.879
we need to have this internal examination we could say

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:32.879
to make sure that spiritually speaking we are developing well.

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:35.879
So with that in mind, perhaps we could look

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:38.879
at one of the adjustments in the revised text

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:40.879
of the New World Transition in English

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:45.879
and just see what an impact this has on our conversation this morning.

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:48.879
So if you'd like to turn with me to the book of Romans,

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:51.879
chapter 12 and verse 2.

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:54.879
This scripture is one that we've often used many of you brothers

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:57.879
who give talks, representing Bethel,

00:04:57.879 --> 00:05:00.879
have used this over and over again.

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:02.879
But let's read it again.

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:05.879
Notice and stop being molded by this system of things

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:10.879
but be transformed by making your mind over.

00:05:10.879 --> 00:05:13.879
Now this expression here transformed.

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:17.879
I think most Bethel brothers giving talks have highlighted

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:21.879
that this actually refers to the word metamorphosis

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:24.879
and we've probably all used the illustration,

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:29.879
haven't we, of how a caterpillar turns into a butterfly.

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:34.879
And what a beautiful illustration that is to highlight

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:37.879
what's meant by the word transform here,

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:40.879
particularly with the original Greek meaning

00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:45.879
that you change completely from one thing to another.

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:50.879
But let's look at a second scripture that helps us in this regard.

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:54.879
It's found in 2 Corinthians chapter 11.

00:05:54.879 --> 00:05:58.879
Now if you check and see what the original New World Transition

00:05:58.879 --> 00:06:01.879
said with regard to these verses,

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:06.879
you'll notice that it likewise used the same English word transform.

00:06:06.879 --> 00:06:08.879
And rightly so because the,

00:06:08.879 --> 00:06:10.879
although there's a different Greek word here,

00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:13.879
both Greek words, the one in Romans 12,

00:06:13.879 --> 00:06:16.879
and also this one in 2 Corinthians 11,

00:06:16.879 --> 00:06:19.879
can have the meaning of being transformed.

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:23.879
But for clarity, we'll notice there's a change in expression here.

00:06:23.879 --> 00:06:29.879
Second Corinthians chapter 11 and verses 13 and 14.

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:33.879
It says, for such men are false apostles,

00:06:33.879 --> 00:06:37.879
deceitful workers, disguising themselves,

00:06:37.879 --> 00:06:41.879
not transforming themselves, but disguising themselves

00:06:41.879 --> 00:06:44.879
as apostles of Christ.

00:06:44.879 --> 00:06:49.879
And no wonder for Satan himself keeps now no longer transforming,

00:06:49.879 --> 00:06:53.879
disguising himself as an angel of light.

00:06:53.879 --> 00:06:55.879
It is therefore nothing extraordinary,

00:06:55.879 --> 00:06:59.879
or extraordinary if his ministers also keep disguising themselves

00:06:59.879 --> 00:07:01.879
as ministers of righteousness.

00:07:01.879 --> 00:07:06.879
But their end will be according to their works.

00:07:06.879 --> 00:07:10.879
So for clarity, to make sure the right connotation of the word

00:07:10.879 --> 00:07:14.879
is used here, the word was translated disguising.

00:07:14.879 --> 00:07:16.879
And why?

00:07:16.879 --> 00:07:18.879
But when we think of this process,

00:07:18.879 --> 00:07:23.879
does Satan change himself into a real angel of light?

00:07:23.879 --> 00:07:27.879
Is that a real process that's taking place?

00:07:27.879 --> 00:07:31.879
Or does he just transform himself in the sense of disguising

00:07:31.879 --> 00:07:35.879
or pretending to be an angel of light?

00:07:35.879 --> 00:07:39.879
Well, that has a very serious implication for us, doesn't it?

00:07:39.879 --> 00:07:44.879
Because as we read God's word and judge our inner motivations,

00:07:44.879 --> 00:07:47.879
what do we need to ask ourselves?

00:07:47.879 --> 00:07:50.879
Am I really transforming myself?

00:07:50.879 --> 00:07:53.879
Is the power of God's word, this Holy Spirit,

00:07:53.879 --> 00:07:57.879
really helping me to become a better person,

00:07:57.879 --> 00:08:02.879
a different person from the one who first learned the truth?

00:08:02.879 --> 00:08:06.879
Certainly none of us would want to put on a disguise.

00:08:06.879 --> 00:08:09.879
In other words, just go about the normal routines

00:08:09.879 --> 00:08:13.879
of being a Christian, going to meetings, witnessing, and so on.

00:08:13.879 --> 00:08:17.879
But not really change inside.

00:08:17.879 --> 00:08:22.879
So what is the key that helps us to continue to make that change?

00:08:22.879 --> 00:08:26.879
Obviously we need the power of Holy Spirit to help us.

00:08:26.879 --> 00:08:30.879
But let's have a look at what Proverbs tells us as a reminder.

00:08:30.879 --> 00:08:35.879
Proverbs chapter 4 and verse 23.

00:08:35.879 --> 00:08:40.879
There it says, above all the things that you guard,

00:08:40.879 --> 00:08:46.879
safeguard your heart, for out of it are the sources of life.

00:08:46.879 --> 00:08:48.879
Isn't that a very profound thought?

00:08:48.879 --> 00:08:50.879
Of all the things we need to guard,

00:08:50.879 --> 00:08:54.879
we really need to put a priority on guarding our hearts,

00:08:54.879 --> 00:08:57.879
to make sure we're not half-hearted or divided,

00:08:57.879 --> 00:09:00.879
but do we serve Jehovah with a complete heart?

00:09:00.879 --> 00:09:02.879
Now what will help us?

00:09:02.879 --> 00:09:08.879
Well, notice please the two verses prior to this admonition found in verse 23.

00:09:08.879 --> 00:09:11.879
Here speaking about the sayings of Jehovah,

00:09:11.879 --> 00:09:14.879
it says, do not lose sight of them,

00:09:14.879 --> 00:09:17.879
keep them deep within your heart,

00:09:17.879 --> 00:09:20.879
for they are life to those who find them

00:09:20.879 --> 00:09:23.879
and health to their whole body.

00:09:23.879 --> 00:09:25.879
So what's the point?

00:09:25.879 --> 00:09:29.879
We can safeguard our heart by making sure we meditate

00:09:29.879 --> 00:09:32.879
and ponder on the sayings of Jehovah.

00:09:32.879 --> 00:09:36.879
Yes, we need to take time to actually think deeply

00:09:36.879 --> 00:09:39.879
about what Jehovah is asking of us.

00:09:39.879 --> 00:09:42.879
And when those things become pleasurable to us,

00:09:42.879 --> 00:09:45.879
they become part of our motivations,

00:09:45.879 --> 00:09:48.879
then we can be sure that with the help of Holy Spirit,

00:09:48.879 --> 00:09:51.879
we will not put on a disguise,

00:09:51.879 --> 00:09:56.879
but we will be transformed so that we can serve Jehovah with a complete heart.
