00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:07.700
Jehovah gives us his Holy Spirit, both individually and as a group.

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.980
To see evidence of that, we need only go to a part of the world where Jehovah's people

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.179
were put under intense pressure.

00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:23.339
In South Africa, for example, the government's policy of racial segregation called apartheid

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:27.899
lasted for 46 years until 1994.

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:32.539
Our brothers were pressured to take sides in armed conflict.

00:00:32.539 --> 00:00:37.899
Their freedom to worship together was limited, and the prevailing attitudes towards people

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:41.420
of different races threatened their unity.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:48.060
In this report, we learn how our South African brothers remained united and neutral in

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:59.810
support of God's kingdom.

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:06.290
One afternoon when we came to the station, there were men who were directing things and

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.730
we were directed to a coach-wise home.

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:18.329
That was the first time that we saw apartheid being law-enforced.

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:24.810
You could not leave the black areas where your home was without getting a permit.

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.129
We were even given a permit that stipulated which area we were allowed to do their preaching

00:01:30.129 --> 00:01:34.519
work in.

00:01:34.519 --> 00:01:38.680
People would always ask us, what are you doing to fight apartheid?

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:43.280
We had to boldly tell that God's kingdom is the only solution.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.920
God will help the whole earth to live in peace one day, so we cannot take sides on political

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.129
issues now.

00:01:53.129 --> 00:01:59.450
Here at home in Soweto, we heard the sound of children running in the streets.

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.409
We heard the sound of gunshots.

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:05.730
Tear gas was everywhere.

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:10.770
When my husband came home that day, we sat with the children and took out the book

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.490
your youth getting the best out of it, and we studied the topic, how do you view your

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:18.879
parents?

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:23.120
This was appropriate because children had the spirit of rebelling against their own

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.120
parents.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:31.780
They went as far as burning people.

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:38.979
They came shouting my son's name, Aquila, Matiba, come out, come out.

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:45.780
And one of them defended him and said, no, no, no, not Aquila.

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.659
Aquila does not do these things.

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:51.659
He will never protest.

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:57.669
Oh, I saw Jehovah's hand in this.

00:02:57.669 --> 00:03:03.189
Even under those circumstances, Jehovah helped our children not to dwell on the madness

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:09.680
in the streets, and we focused on spiritual things.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:17.199
In 1968, when I was 19 years old, I was sentenced to jail for refusing to do military service.

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:23.520
Over a period of 20 years, close to 1,000 young white witness men, somebody took their

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.840
stand for neutrality in this country.

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.400
We used to pray for our white brothers in prison.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:39.759
People in the black townships respected us for the stand these brothers were taking.

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:50.319
In 1974, over 30,000 black and white brothers met for the afternoon session of the divine

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:54.039
victory assembly.

00:03:54.039 --> 00:04:01.639
When we first arrived, there were policemen everywhere.

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:10.689
But after half an hour, they saw how peaceful it was and so they left.

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:18.930
So, those few hours in the dark era of apartheid, we felt that glorious brotherly love

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.610
as we praised Jehovah together.

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:32.209
Umfuchu, umoz es ni amozwa, wa kalwa elinye i te'emblezwa.

00:04:32.209 --> 00:04:38.009
But the Moses ni amozwa was asked by a group on their way to a political rally, to weld

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:40.009
weapons for them.

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:42.769
You refused to do so.

00:04:42.769 --> 00:04:48.449
After their rally, they went back to him and said, you refused to weld our weapons and

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:52.209
some of our comrades were killed in a fight at the rally.

00:04:52.209 --> 00:04:55.449
Now you will die.

00:04:55.449 --> 00:05:02.610
Brother ni amozwa maintained his neutrality all the way to death and Jehovah will remember

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:03.610
him.

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:13.370
In 1993, I was amazed when a white person came preaching house to house.

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:17.449
They came with another white man who could speak vendor fluently.

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:19.209
They're excited me alone.

00:05:19.209 --> 00:05:24.730
And as time went by, I came to realize that this is the true religion because they were

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:28.730
faithful friends and they spoke to me like we were family.

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:35.129
In the late 1980s, the government granted us permission to come in and build kingdom halls

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:37.290
in the black townships.

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:42.970
The local community were absolutely amazed to see all these whites pouring in and working

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:47.250
harder along with their black brothers to build these beautiful kingdom halls.

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:52.370
It was a wonderful privilege to get to know other young people of different races.

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:57.970
Everyone in the congregation feels like family, as long as they see Jehovah.

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:17.839
Today in South Africa, there are more than 100,000 witnesses worshiping together in spirit

00:06:17.839 --> 00:06:19.839
and truth.

00:06:19.839 --> 00:06:22.879
South Africa has 11 official languages.

00:06:22.879 --> 00:06:29.600
And across that cultural variety, our brothers and sisters are all speaking the pure language,

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:32.839
the truth about Jehovah God and his purposes.
