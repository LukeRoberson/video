00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.910
May you all have peace.

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.149
I am Messiper.

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:34.250
Earlier, we considered some of Jesus' miracles,

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.350
including the resurrection of Jerious' daughter.

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.950
Remember?

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.950
Now I will continue my story about why I know for certain

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:48.070
that God made Jesus, Lord, and Christ.

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.509
This is the home of Herod Antipas,

00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:56.109
the Roman-appointed ruler of Galilee and Pariah.

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.350
Jesus performed many miracles in the territories

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.950
under antipasturistician.

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.989
I personally witnessed some of these amazing signs.

00:01:05.989 --> 00:01:09.829
May I remind you that this Herod is the one who,

00:01:09.829 --> 00:01:12.870
despite fear of retaliation by the people,

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.310
killed John the Baptist.

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.510
Something Herod probably regretted.

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.349
So you can imagine Herod's reaction

00:01:21.349 --> 00:01:24.150
when he heard about Jesus and the many miracles

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:35.400
he was performing right in Herod's own dominion.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.060
I cannot concentrate.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.859
I am an accursed man.

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:44.819
Youbulous.

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:46.019
Youbulous.

00:01:46.019 --> 00:01:47.819
Where are you?

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:50.579
Search for youbulous and bring him here immediately

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.859
as you wish, my Lord.

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:56.219
Who is this Jesus of Nazareth?

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.920
And what is he scheming?

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.739
Is he somehow connected with John the Baptist?

00:02:04.739 --> 00:02:07.859
I never should have put John to death.

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:10.659
Antipas, what is the matter?

00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:12.740
Are you well?

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:13.860
Youbulous.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.860
I had a dream last night.

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.419
In the dream, this Jesus of Nazareth appeared.

00:02:20.419 --> 00:02:23.939
Lifted me up in the air, then dropped me to the ground.

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:27.780
And while I was on my knees, he pulled out a long, long, heavy

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.180
sword and chopped off my head.

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.500
What?

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.379
Calm down, please.

00:02:33.419 --> 00:02:35.500
Sit.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.219
What are you talking about?

00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:39.939
What is this dream?

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:41.699
Tell me, youbulous.

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:44.060
What do you know about this Jesus of Nazareth?

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.180
My dear husband, the servants told me

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.060
that you were very anxious this morning.

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.699
I brought your counselors.

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:53.740
What can we do to help?

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:55.819
I'm glad to see you, my lovely Herodius,

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:57.939
and thank you for bringing my counselors.

00:02:57.939 --> 00:02:59.740
You came just in time.

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.219
I was asking youbulous here about Jesus, the Jew,

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:04.659
who's going throughout my dominion,

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:05.979
causing great commotion.

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:08.620
Yes, Antiphas was telling me about a dream.

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:09.460
A nightmare?

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:10.659
Never mind about the dream.

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:13.219
Just tell me who this Jesus is.

00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:16.819
I hear about strange things.

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:21.460
Everything that is happening, very perplexing rumors

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:22.419
about Jesus.

00:03:22.419 --> 00:03:25.379
Have you heard any stories about him?

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:28.460
Well, the reports are mixed.

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:30.740
If you ask some of the Pharisees,

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:34.460
they will tell you that Jesus is a blasphemous man

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:37.300
and that he deceives the masses.

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.180
There are scribes in Jerusalem saying

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.379
that he is empowered by the demons.

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:43.300
But if you ask the common people,

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:44.900
well, that is a different story.

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.860
Some say he is Elijah, returned from the grave.

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.020
Others even claim that Jesus is John the Baptist.

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.860
The man.

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:55.939
Do not mention that name in this house ever again.

00:03:55.939 --> 00:03:58.580
Oh, I hate that man.

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:00.860
He got what he deserved.

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:05.580
I heard that Jesus is related to the man I killed.

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.620
Do you think he's out to exact vengeance?

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.939
My Lord Antiphas, I believe there is no reason

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:12.419
to fear this man.

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:15.900
He is merely a carpenter with a following of fishermen

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.379
and other simple people of the land.

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:21.899
His popularity is sure to die out quickly.

00:04:21.899 --> 00:04:24.899
What about these miracles he seems to be performing?

00:04:24.899 --> 00:04:25.660
Are they real?

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:28.980
May I suggest that you summon him?

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:32.779
Bring him here and ask him to perform a sign

00:04:32.779 --> 00:04:35.540
right in front of your eyes.

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.379
That is an excellent idea.

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:42.300
And when he fails to perform a miracle in your presence,

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.300
you will see that he is nothing more than a simple man

00:04:46.300 --> 00:05:14.019
with the ability to seduce people into following him.

00:05:14.019 --> 00:05:18.259
Who is this man, Jesus of Nazareth?

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:20.740
Where did Antiphas wanted to know?

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:24.019
He was perplexed and anxious.

00:05:24.019 --> 00:05:28.100
People were coming to Jesus from Galilee and the Decapolis,

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:33.339
from Jerusalem and Judea, even from Idomia in the South,

00:05:33.339 --> 00:05:36.060
and from the coastal regions of Tyre and Scydon,

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.379
all the way in the North.

00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:41.180
Great multitudes came to him when they

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:46.720
heard about the many powerful works that he was performing.

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.560
The issue of Jesus' identity and credentials

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:54.319
must have been a subject of great discussion and controversy.

00:05:54.319 --> 00:05:57.800
And Jesus was quite aware of it.

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:02.240
One day, while he was journeying up to Caesarea Philippi,

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:06.319
he brought up the subject of his identity with his apostles.

00:06:06.319 --> 00:06:08.839
Jesus made sure that his disciples understood

00:06:08.839 --> 00:06:13.519
beyond any doubt that he was indeed the Messiah,

00:06:13.519 --> 00:06:15.519
the Son of God.

00:06:15.519 --> 00:06:25.350
Listen in.

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:28.790
Jesus, maybe the rest here, at least for a few minutes,

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:32.310
of course, and we can drink some water.

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:35.029
We will reach Caesarea before noon.

00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:37.670
I wonder if we will be well received by the people.

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:39.189
Of course they'll receive as well.

00:06:39.189 --> 00:06:40.509
We have the Messiah with us.

00:06:40.509 --> 00:06:42.949
What makes you so sure of how the people view me?

00:06:42.949 --> 00:06:45.269
Let us talk about this for a moment, brothers.

00:06:45.269 --> 00:06:46.870
Who are the crowds saying that I am?

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:48.389
What have you actually heard?

00:06:48.389 --> 00:06:49.750
I don't know the answer to that.

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:52.470
Let the others speak first.

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:53.910
Breatholomy, what have you heard?

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:56.189
Some of my relatives are saying that you're Elijah.

00:06:56.189 --> 00:07:00.509
That somehow Jehovah has brought the prophet Elijah back to life.

00:07:00.509 --> 00:07:03.149
Judas, what have people told you?

00:07:03.149 --> 00:07:03.990
Pardon me, Lord.

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:05.350
What's your question?

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:07.110
Judas, what are you doing?

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:08.509
Counting money?

00:07:08.509 --> 00:07:09.750
This is important.

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:11.870
You should listen to what Jesus is saying.

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:14.149
Who gave you permission to speak?

00:07:14.149 --> 00:07:16.550
I know what I'm doing.

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:20.470
Lord, I'm just making sure we have enough money for lodging.

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:22.509
Surely we don't want to sleep outdoors tonight.

00:07:22.509 --> 00:07:23.629
John is right, Judas.

00:07:23.629 --> 00:07:24.870
Please listen carefully.

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:26.790
This is very important.

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:28.709
Matthew, what are the tax collectors saying?

00:07:28.709 --> 00:07:31.709
Well, I heard talk about you being Jeremiah,

00:07:31.709 --> 00:07:34.029
or one of the other prophets of old.

00:07:34.029 --> 00:07:36.550
Teacher, where do all these ideas come from?

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:39.110
Why would people believe that you're someone from the past?

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:41.870
No prophet has ever come back from the grave.

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:44.230
The deus, the scriptures do speak of Elijah coming

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:46.670
before the great non-spiring day of Jehovah.

00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:48.629
I can see how many who lack understanding

00:07:48.629 --> 00:07:50.670
may conclude that Elijah himself will return

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:53.350
from the grave in this system of things.

00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:55.990
Simon, who are the people saying that I am?

00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:57.589
John the Baptist.

00:07:57.589 --> 00:08:00.470
Yes, even Herod Antipas.

00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:03.790
That fox, as you called him, fears that you

00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:08.310
might be John the Baptist coming back to hunt him.

00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:11.750
Elijah, Jeremiah, John the Baptist.

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:14.069
You, though, who do you say I am?

00:08:14.069 --> 00:08:16.709
You are the Christ, son of the living God.

00:08:16.709 --> 00:08:18.069
But how do you know that?

00:08:18.069 --> 00:08:19.189
What makes you so confident?

00:08:19.189 --> 00:08:20.310
How do we know?

00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:22.990
Well, we have seen your works and your wisdom.

00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:24.790
You speak the words of Jehovah or God.

00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:27.269
Your sayings are inspired by God.

00:08:27.269 --> 00:08:31.029
The priests, the Pharisees, the Sadducees, Jewish leaders.

00:08:31.029 --> 00:08:33.029
They have also seen the signs I perform.

00:08:33.029 --> 00:08:34.750
And they have heard what I preach.

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:36.230
Yet they do not believe in me.

00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:40.990
Teacher, for a certainty, God has made you Lord and Christ.

00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:43.110
Brothers, think of all the prophecies

00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:45.070
that pointed Jesus as her Savior.

00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:45.909
The promised Messiah.

00:08:45.909 --> 00:08:48.149
Happy you are, Simon, son of Jonah,

00:08:48.149 --> 00:08:50.710
because flesh and blood did not reveal it to you.

00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:53.110
But my father in the heavens did.

00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:56.429
Also, I say to you, you are Peter.

00:08:56.429 --> 00:08:59.990
And on this rock, I will build my congregation.

00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:03.590
And the gates of the grave will not overpower it.

00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:07.350
I will give you the keys of the kingdom of the heavens.

00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:09.350
And whatever you may bind on earth

00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:11.590
will already be bound in the heavens.

00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:13.629
And whatever you may loosen on earth

00:09:13.629 --> 00:09:15.950
will already be loosened in the heavens.

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:18.509
May it be Jehovah who reveals my identity

00:09:18.509 --> 00:09:21.029
to all those who deserve to know it.

00:09:21.029 --> 00:09:31.789
Men, brothers, please do not identify me as the Christ to anyone.

00:09:31.789 --> 00:09:34.950
Do not say that I am the Son of God or the Messiah.

00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:54.909
Let Jehovah reveal it to those who have faith.

00:09:54.909 --> 00:09:58.789
Did you get the sense of what Jesus just told his apostles?

00:09:58.789 --> 00:10:00.629
Especially what he said to Peter.

00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:04.389
Happy you are, he told Peter,

00:10:04.389 --> 00:10:07.389
because flesh and blood did not reveal it to you.

00:10:07.429 --> 00:10:11.529
But my father in the heavens did.

00:10:11.529 --> 00:10:15.409
How did Peter recognize Jesus as the Messiah?

00:10:15.409 --> 00:10:17.210
Was it simply a matter of Peter having been

00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:19.690
an eyewitness to many of Jesus miracles?

00:10:20.929 --> 00:10:25.009
Was it Peter's mental ability or human wisdom?

00:10:25.009 --> 00:10:26.570
No.

00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:28.730
It was his spirituality,

00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:31.090
his friendship with Jehovah

00:10:31.090 --> 00:10:34.649
that enabled him to discern the truth about Jesus.

00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:38.370
Thus, Jehovah revealed it to Peter.

00:10:40.090 --> 00:10:42.330
A person can witness countless miracles,

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:46.690
but if he has no spiritual perception,

00:10:46.690 --> 00:10:49.450
those miracles will have little or no effect on him.

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:54.250
That explains why most religious leaders in my day

00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:55.850
completely missed out.

00:10:57.570 --> 00:11:01.450
On the other hand, those of us who had faith in Jesus

00:11:01.450 --> 00:11:04.570
witnessed some of the most important events in history.

00:11:05.649 --> 00:11:07.570
Let me give you one example.

00:11:07.570 --> 00:12:03.419
Voice and do not pointed him.

00:12:03.419 --> 00:12:05.820
The girl is right.

00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:09.539
It is Jason, the blind man.

00:12:09.539 --> 00:12:11.100
Jason?

00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:12.659
It is you.

00:12:12.659 --> 00:12:15.139
I can't believe it's you.

00:12:15.139 --> 00:12:17.379
Jason, the blind man.

00:12:17.379 --> 00:12:19.500
This cannot possibly be the beggar.

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:21.379
He just looks like him.

00:12:21.379 --> 00:12:24.580
Well, I am he, but I'm not blind anymore.

00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:28.259
I can see for the very first time in my life

00:12:28.259 --> 00:12:29.899
how then were your eyes opened?

00:12:29.899 --> 00:12:32.460
The man called Jesus made a paste

00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:35.299
and smeared it on my eyes and said to me,

00:12:35.299 --> 00:12:37.100
go to Salom and wash.

00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:39.980
So I went and washed and gained sight.

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:44.980
How can a man who was born blind be healed from his blindness?

00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:46.500
That is impossible.

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:49.539
I'm told that the man spat on the ground.

00:12:49.539 --> 00:12:51.700
Then he bent down and made a paste

00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:53.860
by mixing his saliva with the dirt.

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:57.820
After that, I felt him smear the paste on my eyes.

00:12:57.820 --> 00:12:59.700
I did not know what was happening.

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:03.659
Yet when I washed the paste from my eyes, I began to see.

00:13:03.659 --> 00:13:06.019
Other than that, I do not know anything.

00:13:06.019 --> 00:13:08.419
You said that the man's name is Jesus.

00:13:08.419 --> 00:13:09.860
Where is this man?

00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:11.220
I do not know.

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:12.059
Excuse me.

00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:16.179
Jason, is that your name?

00:13:16.179 --> 00:13:17.019
Yes, Rabbi.

00:13:17.019 --> 00:13:18.419
I am Jason, Son of a Lizer.

00:13:18.419 --> 00:13:20.340
I am fascinated by your story.

00:13:21.259 --> 00:13:23.379
Could I please persuade you to come in

00:13:23.379 --> 00:13:25.220
related to my friends?

00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:28.220
They are teachers of a law, like me.

00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:30.659
In fact, they are over there by the edge of the market.

00:13:30.659 --> 00:13:32.419
I know exactly where they sit.

00:13:32.419 --> 00:13:34.580
I could get there with my eyes closed.

00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:43.029
Please, come with me.

00:13:43.029 --> 00:13:45.710
My brothers, what is this?

00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:47.990
Are you that popular with the crowds now?

00:13:49.029 --> 00:13:51.750
My brothers, you must listen to this man's story.

00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:53.710
It is quite intriguing.

00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:57.309
Jason, please tell them who you are and what happened.

00:13:58.309 --> 00:14:01.110
My name is Jason, Son of a Lizer.

00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:05.429
Probably you have seen me sitting by the side of the road,

00:14:05.429 --> 00:14:07.190
asking passers-by for money.

00:14:07.190 --> 00:14:08.590
Wait a moment.

00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:12.110
You're the blind beggar from down the road?

00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:13.830
How is that possible?

00:14:13.830 --> 00:14:15.990
Well, let me explain.

00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:18.070
I was born blind.

00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:21.389
But yesterday, Jesus of Nazareth,

00:14:21.389 --> 00:14:24.070
put a paste on my eyes and I washed,

00:14:24.070 --> 00:14:25.389
and now I can see.

00:14:25.389 --> 00:14:27.389
Did you say yesterday?

00:14:27.389 --> 00:14:29.190
Yesterday was the Sabbath.

00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:32.389
This Jesus of Nazareth is a sinner.

00:14:32.389 --> 00:14:33.990
He is not a man from God,

00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:36.309
for he does not observe the Sabbath.

00:14:36.309 --> 00:14:39.710
How can a man who is a sinner

00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:44.070
perform signs of that sort, see for yourselves?

00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:45.909
This man was born blind.

00:14:45.909 --> 00:14:49.230
He did not get sick and then recover.

00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:53.950
His blindness was not caused by an accident or by a disease.

00:14:53.950 --> 00:14:56.190
He was blind from birth.

00:14:56.190 --> 00:14:58.470
You're all witnesses of this,

00:14:58.470 --> 00:15:02.909
as we have all seen him on our streets, begging.

00:15:02.909 --> 00:15:07.389
Clearly, this Jesus is a man of God.

00:15:09.669 --> 00:15:11.389
Calm down, please.

00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:15.950
There is no reason to be divided over this issue.

00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:18.429
Jason, what do you say about him?

00:15:18.429 --> 00:15:24.090
Since you say he opened your eyes.

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:27.649
I believe that this man Jesus is indeed a prophet.

00:15:27.649 --> 00:15:31.370
How do we know that he was really born blind?

00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:34.129
People, the beggar's parents are here.

00:15:34.129 --> 00:15:35.970
What do they have to say about it?

00:15:35.970 --> 00:15:39.769
Yes, you seem to be respectable Jews.

00:15:39.769 --> 00:15:42.250
Please help us resolve this issue.

00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:46.730
Is this your son when you say was born blind?

00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:48.330
How then does he now see?

00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:50.850
First, let me reassure you.

00:15:50.850 --> 00:15:52.649
I am a God-fearing man

00:15:52.690 --> 00:15:54.730
who observes the law of Moses.

00:15:54.730 --> 00:15:57.049
Please speak frankly. Why do you hesitate?

00:15:57.049 --> 00:16:00.610
Well, it's been said there is agreement that

00:16:00.610 --> 00:16:04.529
if anyone acknowledges Jesus as a man of God,

00:16:04.529 --> 00:16:08.169
that person will be expelled from the synagogue.

00:16:08.169 --> 00:16:12.490
Speak, man, and do not worry about being expelled.

00:16:12.490 --> 00:16:16.490
We know that this is our son and that he was born blind.

00:16:17.529 --> 00:16:21.049
But how it is that he now sees we do not know

00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:24.210
and who opened his eyes, we do not know.

00:16:24.210 --> 00:16:26.490
Why do you not ask him? He's of age.

00:16:26.490 --> 00:16:28.529
He must speak for himself.

00:16:28.529 --> 00:16:29.490
Very well.

00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:35.049
Jason, we rejoice with you because you can see now.

00:16:35.049 --> 00:16:38.490
Give glory to God, not the man Jesus.

00:16:38.490 --> 00:16:40.009
We know that he is a sinner.

00:16:41.009 --> 00:16:43.769
Whether he's a sinner, I do not know.

00:16:43.769 --> 00:16:47.169
One thing I do know is that I was blind and now I can see.

00:16:47.169 --> 00:16:49.649
But what did Jesus do to you?

00:16:49.690 --> 00:16:51.929
How did he open your eyes?

00:16:51.929 --> 00:16:53.370
I told you already.

00:16:53.370 --> 00:16:55.529
And yet you do not listen.

00:16:55.529 --> 00:16:57.409
Why do you want to hear it again?

00:16:57.409 --> 00:16:59.769
You do not want to become as disciples also, do you?

00:16:59.769 --> 00:17:02.129
You are a disciple of that man.

00:17:02.129 --> 00:17:04.210
We are disciples of Moses.

00:17:04.210 --> 00:17:07.130
We know that God has spoken to Moses.

00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:11.410
But as for this man, we do not know where he is from.

00:17:11.410 --> 00:17:13.490
This is certainly amazing,

00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:15.970
that you do not know where Jesus comes from.

00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:18.009
And yet he opened my eyes.

00:17:18.009 --> 00:17:20.849
We know that God does not listen to sinners.

00:17:20.849 --> 00:17:23.769
But if anyone is God-fearing and does God's will,

00:17:23.769 --> 00:17:25.609
he listens to this one.

00:17:25.609 --> 00:17:28.049
From a bold, it's never been heard

00:17:28.049 --> 00:17:31.170
that anyone opened the eyes of one born blind.

00:17:31.170 --> 00:17:32.529
If this man were not from God,

00:17:32.529 --> 00:17:33.690
he could do nothing at all.

00:17:33.690 --> 00:17:36.809
You were all together born in sin.

00:17:36.809 --> 00:17:38.970
And yet are you teaching us?

00:17:38.970 --> 00:17:41.609
Throw him out.

00:17:41.609 --> 00:18:12.230
Talk him away from here.

00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:14.230
Jason, are you well?

00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:18.940
The Pharisees treated me harshly.

00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:22.099
But how could I complain?

00:18:22.099 --> 00:18:23.819
Now I can see.

00:18:23.819 --> 00:18:25.819
I'm forever grateful to you.

00:18:25.819 --> 00:18:29.700
But Jason, are you putting faith in the Son of Man?

00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:33.859
And who is he, sir, so that I may put faith in him?

00:18:33.859 --> 00:18:35.819
You have seen him.

00:18:35.819 --> 00:18:42.430
And in fact, he's the one speaking with you.

00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:57.779
That I do put faith in him, Lord.

00:18:57.779 --> 00:19:00.579
That was an amazing miracle.

00:19:00.579 --> 00:19:03.380
The man had been born blind.

00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:06.099
That fact was undeniable.

00:19:06.099 --> 00:19:09.220
And God gave Jesus the power to heal the blind man

00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:11.940
so that he could see.

00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:14.859
Yet, how did the Pharisees react?

00:19:14.859 --> 00:19:17.460
They should have been awestruck over what was obviously

00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:20.380
God's power in action.

00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:24.619
Instead, the Pharisees portrayed Jesus as a sinner

00:19:24.619 --> 00:19:27.299
and got sidetracked by the fact that he performed the miracle

00:19:27.299 --> 00:19:29.220
on the Sabbath.

00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:32.140
They lacked faith.

00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:36.740
Pride and jealousy blinded him to the truth.

00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:40.299
On the other hand, humble people who were thirsty for the truth

00:19:40.299 --> 00:19:45.779
were convinced by this miracle and began to believe in Jesus.

00:19:45.779 --> 00:19:49.779
Recalling this event, strengthens my faith, too.

00:19:49.779 --> 00:19:53.220
Yet another miracle impressed me more.

00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:58.099
It was perhaps the most memorable miracle Jesus performed.

00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:06.619
Let me tell you about it.

00:20:06.619 --> 00:20:08.740
Jesus.

00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:13.500
Martha, I did not expect to see you here.

00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:15.019
Where's Mary?

00:20:15.019 --> 00:20:18.380
They told me that you were coming, and I just could not wait.

00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:22.619
Martha, may you have peace and make

00:20:22.619 --> 00:20:24.940
you hope a comfort your morning heart.

00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:27.539
Martha, we are all deeply saddened.

00:20:27.539 --> 00:20:31.339
The death of your brother, our friend Lazarus.

00:20:31.339 --> 00:20:33.900
Thank you, Philip.

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:39.220
I think all of you, Lord, if you had been here,

00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:42.589
my brother would not have died.

00:20:42.589 --> 00:20:47.470
Yet, even now, I know that whatever you ask God for,

00:20:47.470 --> 00:20:49.309
God will give you.

00:20:49.309 --> 00:20:51.230
Your brother will rise.

00:20:51.230 --> 00:20:54.509
Lazarus will live again.

00:20:54.509 --> 00:20:57.630
I know that my brother will rise.

00:20:57.630 --> 00:21:01.309
I know that there won't be a resurrection on the last day.

00:21:01.309 --> 00:21:04.549
I am the resurrection and the life.

00:21:04.549 --> 00:21:08.390
The one who exercises faith in me, even though he dies,

00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:10.230
will come to life.

00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:12.470
Do you believe this?

00:21:12.470 --> 00:21:13.950
Yes, Lord.

00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:17.990
I have believed that you are the Christ, the Son of God,

00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:21.289
the one coming into the world.

00:21:21.289 --> 00:21:24.890
Martha, my sister, my father in heaven

00:21:24.890 --> 00:21:27.490
will bless you for your faith.

00:21:27.490 --> 00:21:29.410
Where is Mary?

00:21:29.410 --> 00:21:39.640
I will get her.

00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:53.269
Lord Mary is here.

00:21:53.269 --> 00:22:16.970
My brother would not have died.

00:22:16.970 --> 00:22:18.769
Where have you laid him?

00:22:18.769 --> 00:22:33.640
Lord, come and see.

00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:37.119
Lazarus was dead four days.

00:22:37.119 --> 00:22:39.440
His body had been carefully prepared for burial

00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:42.079
according to Jewish custom.

00:22:42.079 --> 00:22:45.000
He was not embalmed as the Egyptians were,

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.599
so his body had already begun to decay.

00:22:48.599 --> 00:22:53.200
Still, Martha and Mary had faith in Jesus' power.

00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:58.119
They knew beyond a doubt that Jesus was the Messiah.

00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:02.079
So they took Jesus to the cave where Lazarus had been laid.

00:23:02.079 --> 00:23:28.420
A large stone was lying against the entrance to the cave.

00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:30.539
Please be quiet.

00:23:30.539 --> 00:23:34.099
Let us listen to what the Lord Jesus is about to say.

00:23:34.099 --> 00:23:39.319
Take the stone away.

00:23:39.319 --> 00:23:44.880
Lord, I know he must smell, because it has been four days.

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:47.200
Did I not tell you that if you would believe

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:57.779
you would see the glory of God?

00:23:57.779 --> 00:24:02.579
Father, I thank you that you have heard me.

00:24:02.579 --> 00:24:05.740
True, I knew that you always hear me,

00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:08.500
but I spoke on account of the crowd standing around

00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:14.559
so that they may believe that you sent me.

00:24:14.559 --> 00:24:35.740
Lazarus, come out.

00:24:35.740 --> 00:25:07.470
Free him and let him go.

00:25:07.470 --> 00:25:11.109
The resurrection of Lazarus, providing clear evidence

00:25:11.109 --> 00:25:14.549
that Jesus was God's son.

00:25:14.549 --> 00:25:16.630
Unlike others who had been resurrected,

00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:19.990
Lazarus had been dead four days.

00:25:19.990 --> 00:25:22.869
Everyone knew that.

00:25:22.869 --> 00:25:26.230
As a result of this one outstanding miracle,

00:25:26.230 --> 00:25:32.109
many put faith in Jesus, yet not everyone reacted

00:25:32.109 --> 00:25:34.470
in a positive way.

00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:38.670
In fact, Lazarus' resurrection triggered a chain of events

00:25:38.670 --> 00:25:43.119
that led to Jesus' own death.

00:25:43.119 --> 00:25:47.759
From the moment Kaphus, the high priest, heard about Lazarus,

00:25:47.759 --> 00:25:52.319
he began to conspire against Jesus aggressively.

00:25:52.359 --> 00:25:58.200
His intention was to kill both Jesus and Lazarus.

00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:01.920
Of course, Jesus knew he had to die.

00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:06.920
And in God's own due time, Jesus was killed by his enemies,

00:26:07.559 --> 00:26:13.180
by people who refused to acknowledge his credentials.

00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:16.819
It is ironic, however, that murdering Jesus

00:26:16.819 --> 00:26:19.859
resulted in exactly what they had sought to avoid.

00:26:20.859 --> 00:26:25.859
On the day Jesus died, Jehovah God provided even more proof

00:26:25.859 --> 00:26:32.289
that Jesus was the Messiah first.

00:26:33.289 --> 00:26:38.289
As Jesus was agonizing on the torture stake at about noon,

00:26:38.289 --> 00:26:41.289
the skies went dark,

00:26:41.289 --> 00:26:45.289
and they remained dark for three hours.

00:26:45.289 --> 00:26:49.289
This mystified the people who were there.

00:26:50.289 --> 00:26:53.289
It was obviously a sign from heaven,

00:26:53.289 --> 00:26:58.670
then Jesus said his final words.

00:26:58.670 --> 00:27:04.670
Father, in two your hands, I entrust my spirit.

00:27:04.670 --> 00:27:08.670
And at that very moment, there was a violent earthquake

00:27:08.670 --> 00:27:11.670
that split open, massive rocks.

00:27:11.670 --> 00:27:14.670
The earthquake was so powerful

00:27:14.670 --> 00:27:17.670
that tombs outside Jerusalem were broken open

00:27:17.670 --> 00:27:20.670
and corpses rolled out.

00:27:20.670 --> 00:27:24.670
And in the temple, the large and heavy curtain

00:27:24.670 --> 00:27:27.670
that divided the holy from the most holy

00:27:27.670 --> 00:27:31.670
was miraculously torn in two from top to bottom.

00:27:31.670 --> 00:27:41.240
This happened almost simultaneously.

00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:44.240
It was Jehovah's power,

00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:48.240
and the people were in awe and in fear.

00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:52.240
The Army officer, in charge of Jesus' execution,

00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:56.240
finally understood who Jesus really was.

00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:58.240
After seeing these things,

00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:01.240
he looked up at Jesus' dead body

00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:05.240
and proclaimed, certainly,

00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:16.720
this was God's Son.

00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:21.509
Jesus' death sat in me deeply,

00:28:21.509 --> 00:28:25.509
but watching these events play out before my eyes,

00:28:25.509 --> 00:28:28.509
deep in my conviction and my faith in Jesus,

00:28:28.509 --> 00:28:34.329
then, less than three days later,

00:28:34.329 --> 00:28:37.329
I saw Jesus alive.

00:28:37.329 --> 00:28:41.329
Yes, Jehovah brought Him back to life.

00:28:41.329 --> 00:28:43.329
Later, I traveled to Galilee,

00:28:43.329 --> 00:28:45.329
and I saw Him,

00:28:45.329 --> 00:28:48.329
and I heard His wisdom once more.

00:28:48.329 --> 00:28:53.329
I was part of a crowd of about 500 people that day.

00:28:53.329 --> 00:28:57.329
Then, before ascending to heaven,

00:28:57.329 --> 00:29:00.329
Jesus gathered with His 11 faithful apostles

00:29:00.329 --> 00:29:03.329
near the Mount of Olives.

00:29:03.329 --> 00:29:06.329
Let us watch Jesus' final moments on earth,

00:29:06.329 --> 00:29:23.410
and hear His words.

00:29:23.410 --> 00:29:26.410
It's hard to believe that Judas is no longer with us.

00:29:26.410 --> 00:29:29.410
It's hard to believe that He betrayed the Lord.

00:29:29.410 --> 00:29:32.410
After all, He saw with His own eyes all the miracles,

00:29:32.410 --> 00:29:35.410
and after hearing all of Jesus' teachings,

00:29:35.410 --> 00:29:38.410
day after day, traveling with us,

00:29:38.410 --> 00:29:39.410
what happened?

00:29:39.410 --> 00:29:43.410
Do we have to talk about Judas, the traitor?

00:29:43.410 --> 00:29:45.410
I agree.

00:29:45.410 --> 00:29:47.410
Let us change the subject.

00:29:47.410 --> 00:29:59.000
You all know by now that a few days before Jesus died,

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:02.000
James, John, Andrew, and I,

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.000
approached him privately and asked him

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.000
when the conclusion of this system of things would take place.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:10.000
James, do you remember how he answered?

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:14.000
Yes. He said that he did not know.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.000
He said, concerning that day and hour, nobody knows.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:21.000
Neither the angels of the heavens, nor the sun,

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.000
but only the Father.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.000
He urged us to keep awake,

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.000
because we do not know when the appointed time is.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.000
Exactly.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:32.000
Well, now that Jesus has been resurrected

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.000
and has a spiritual body,

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.000
and undoubtedly has special communication

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.000
with this heavenly Father,

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:41.000
could it be that the Father has revealed to His Son

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.000
the day and the hour?

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.000
Greetings, my brothers.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:48.000
My heart is full of joy as I see all of you gathered here with me.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.000
Lord, we wanted to ask you,

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:53.000
are you restoring the kingdom to Israel at this time?

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:56.000
Do you now know the day and the hour?

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:59.000
Peter, I know that this matter of the day and the hour

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.000
weighs heavily on your mind.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.000
This is the second time you've asked.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:06.000
All of you, listen carefully.

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.000
It does not belong to you to know,

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:11.000
the times or seasons that the Father has placed

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.000
in His own jurisdiction.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:17.000
But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you,

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:20.000
and you will be witnesses of me in Jerusalem,

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.000
in all Judea and Samaria,

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:25.000
and to the most distant part of the earth.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:29.440
Peter, may God bless you.

00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:35.789
May Jehovah be with you, Andrew.

00:31:35.789 --> 00:31:42.990
The deus, may God's Spirit be with you.

00:31:42.990 --> 00:32:07.130
Rathalamu, James, Matthew, Philip, Simon,

00:32:07.130 --> 00:32:12.779
James, son of Alfias.

00:32:12.779 --> 00:32:21.279
May Jehovah bless all of you.

00:32:21.279 --> 00:32:31.119
Thomas, John, may God give you His Spirit

00:32:31.119 --> 00:33:11.720
and bless you with many days.

00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:14.720
How do I know that Jesus is the Messiah?

00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:18.720
How do I know that Christians have the truth?

00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:22.720
I have answered those questions in my heart.

00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:24.720
What about you?

00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:28.720
You too can benefit by asking yourself,

00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:33.720
how do I know that Jehovah's Witnesses have the truth?

00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:38.720
Have you answered that question in your heart?

00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:41.720
You see, over time, the anxieties of life

00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:44.720
can blur our spiritual vision.

00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:48.720
As the years go by, we could lose our zeal,

00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:50.720
and our worship could become perfunctory.

00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:55.599
That happened to me at one point.

00:33:56.599 --> 00:33:59.599
Then I begged Jehovah for more faith,

00:33:59.599 --> 00:34:01.599
and he answered me.

00:34:01.599 --> 00:34:05.599
He helped me remember all the prophecies I had seen fulfilled,

00:34:05.599 --> 00:34:10.599
and the great works Jesus performed when he was on earth.

00:34:10.599 --> 00:34:13.599
I had no reason to doubt.

00:34:13.599 --> 00:34:19.599
All I had to do was stay awake, stay alert, open my eyes,

00:34:19.599 --> 00:34:24.599
and take the time to consider all the evidence at hand.

00:34:24.599 --> 00:34:29.599
May Jehovah likewise strengthen your faith in Jesus our King

00:34:29.599 --> 00:34:35.599
because for a certainty, God made him both Lord and Christ.
