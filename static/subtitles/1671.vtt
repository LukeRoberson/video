00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:07.259
Bill Richards is from the Talawa tribe that lives in the northwestern area of the United States.

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:14.640
He and others from his tribe knew there was a creator, but did not yet know him personally.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.140
Telleha, see who she is, how are you?

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.940
Nestling.

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:21.739
Talawa, Dini, howin' quit.

00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:24.739
Just me, Nestling.

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:29.739
I was born in the government hospital on the Hooper Reservation.

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:36.140
I am an enrolled member of the Talawa tribe.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:44.140
For many years, I served as tribal chairman, which some people know as chief or headman,

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.140
as did my father and grandfather.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.140
The word Talawa means people to the north,

00:00:52.140 --> 00:01:00.140
or ancestral territories straddles the northern California and southern Oregon mollors.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:06.140
On my early years, I considered it a good, fun place to grow up in.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.140
During the summer, we have a fish run down here that's very important to us.

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.140
It's what we call a spelt run.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.140
We have the yoke and the deer.

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:18.140
We had a good life here.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.140
We lived off the land.

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.140
We had salmon and the rivers.

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.140
We had the berries, the acorns.

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.140
I think we needed what's provided for us here by our creator.

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:38.140
I went to school and spent forever, and right out of high school, I joined the military service.

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:44.140
In the military, it was eye-opening for me when I was transferred to the East Coast.

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.140
Their prejudice was right out in the open.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:54.140
And that was really very surprising to me that it could be that strong of prejudice.

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.140
About that time I met Viola.

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.140
My wife, we've been married.

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.140
This September will be 55 years.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:08.139
Well, I started studying after Viola had been studying for a number of weeks.

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:14.139
We started a weekly Bible study, and I was engaging that for quite some time.

00:02:14.139 --> 00:02:19.139
And then one of the sisters seeing my husband that he was here.

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:22.139
And she started talking to him pretty soon.

00:02:22.139 --> 00:02:28.139
He started talking again, and then it got to the table, and we started a study.

00:02:28.139 --> 00:02:30.139
And he wasn't through that.

00:02:30.139 --> 00:02:35.139
You know, the more I studied, the more knowledge the energy it got.

00:02:35.139 --> 00:02:40.139
And studying the Bible early on, it wasn't too bad.

00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:42.139
It went to community.

00:02:42.139 --> 00:02:51.139
But when we started on a regular basis, then it interfered with me and some of the meetings here.

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:56.139
And local meetings came on a certain night in New Zealand, when we had the Bible study.

00:02:56.139 --> 00:03:01.139
One of the things that they really had a hard time adjusting to was death,

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:06.139
because it showed honor to the person that was their last statement in life.

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:09.139
And that was to have a funeral.

00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:15.139
We could not always attend, but we showed in other ways that we did care.

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:22.139
And we would go to the fellowship gathering after the funeral to show our support.

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:30.139
Holidays were an extremely difficult challenge because it was a family gathering time.

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:35.139
It was hard to make those adjustments and explain to our family.

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:39.139
We progressed from there until our baptism.

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:43.139
And she said, I am ready to get baptized.

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:48.650
And so I said, well, I am ready to.

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.650
So we got baptized together.

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.650
I was baptized at 71 years of age.

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:00.650
Sometimes I would go to an convention and I would look around and see how many Native Americans I could pinpoint.

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:02.650
You know, it wasn't very many.

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:08.650
I have been telling Brother Dave that, hey, I am not seeing too many Native Americans.

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:15.650
And he said, well, you'd better get busy and start teaching them.

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:17.649
And he's right.

00:04:17.649 --> 00:04:25.649
This day, you know, if I can reach a Native American, then that's what I want to do, or anybody else.

00:04:25.649 --> 00:04:31.649
Many people in our Native identity today carries an eagle feather.

00:04:31.649 --> 00:04:37.649
And it's just a symbol of being protected, but they didn't know his name.

00:04:37.649 --> 00:04:39.649
They called him Creator.

00:04:39.649 --> 00:04:44.649
And now I share with some of the ones and the responsive they listen.

00:04:44.649 --> 00:04:47.649
And I said, I know his name.

00:04:47.649 --> 00:04:51.649
And I told him it was Jehovah.

00:04:51.649 --> 00:04:57.649
I have a special feeling for the Houndquit community cemetery down here,

00:04:57.649 --> 00:05:00.649
because I'm looking at the names and all that.

00:05:00.649 --> 00:05:06.649
You know, I realized that my mother and father are both buried there.

00:05:06.649 --> 00:05:12.649
The biggest hope now, and Dave and Kim really expanded well to me that.

00:05:12.649 --> 00:05:14.649
You're going to see them again.

00:05:14.649 --> 00:05:16.649
That's the big hope.

00:05:16.649 --> 00:05:19.649
Another blessing is our children.

00:05:19.649 --> 00:05:24.649
They have been attending the memorial, and then other special talks.

00:05:24.649 --> 00:05:30.649
You know, we have them join us, and that definitely is a blessing.

00:05:30.649 --> 00:05:34.279
I have received many blessings.

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:37.279
I have a better relationship with my wife.

00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:40.279
I even take my shoes off when I come into the house.

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:45.279
I have many meaningful relationships within the congregation.

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:56.259
And I get to teach other Native to serve Jehovah.

00:05:56.259 --> 00:06:00.259
Bible truth appeals to people from all backgrounds.

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:04.259
In Brother Richard's case, he left his post as chief and tribal chairman

00:06:04.259 --> 00:06:07.259
when he dedicated himself to God.
