00:00:01.389 --> 00:00:10.589
Wouldn't it be great? Yes, it would be great. But we have a lot of questions, don't we?

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:18.390
The first question is, do we hear that correctly? That not only are we receiving a new publication,

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:27.390
but we're also starting a new method of conducting Bible studies. The answer is yes.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:37.390
But why is that necessary? Well, to answer that question, let's think of a few things that have changed in recent years.

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:44.390
For example, think about the New World Translation and the revision of the New World Translation.

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:51.390
Was that revised because the reference Bible was no longer any good? No.

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:59.390
We remember the explanation given that reading skills of people have changed.

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:07.390
No longer do people enjoy reading and taking that slow journey to eventually get to a destination.

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:14.390
But rather, this modern age, we find that people are wanting to get to the destination very quickly.

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:20.390
They want clear, simple explanations that give them the meaning quickly.

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:26.390
But what if the governing body, when they were considering whether or not to revise the New World Translation,

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:35.390
had said, but we can't do this because the brothers and sisters would have to learn a whole lot of new vocabulary.

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:44.390
And all their favorite scriptures, they'd have to memorize again, and they probably wouldn't be able to find those verses on the right page in the Bible.

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.390
But the governing body didn't decide that, not to have the revision.

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:56.390
But rather, we saw how Jehovah blessed the revision of the New World Translation.

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:02.390
And haven't we been happy using this and getting the benefits from it?

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:09.389
But not only have reading skills changed, but also learning skills.

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:15.389
And that's shown by some of the adjustments that have been made to our midweek meeting.

00:02:15.389 --> 00:02:25.389
Now we see our midweek meeting is fast-moving, it's interesting, and it seems so much easier to learn things about the Bible.

00:02:25.389 --> 00:02:34.389
Recently I was talking to a sister, who has been in the truth for about 65 years, and she said concerning the midweek meeting,

00:02:34.389 --> 00:02:41.389
I have learned more about the Bible in the last few years than in the previous 60 years.

00:02:41.389 --> 00:02:44.389
And isn't that true?

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:49.389
But what if the governing body, when they were considering this change, had said,

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:55.389
well, we can't make that change because the older brothers and sisters won't be able to adapt to it?

00:02:55.389 --> 00:02:59.389
Aren't we happy that the change was made?

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:06.389
Of course we are, because we can see the beautiful benefits that have come from that change.

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:15.280
When we think about all these changes that have occurred, we can see that it fulfills what Jehovah promised.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.280
And if you turn with me please to the book of Isaiah.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.280
Isaiah chapter 60.

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:28.280
And let's remind ourselves of what is said in the beginning of verse 17.

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:35.280
Here Jehovah promises, instead of the copper, I will bring in gold.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:44.280
And instead of the iron, I will bring in silver, instead of the wood, copper, and instead of the stones, iron.

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:55.280
Doesn't this describe nicely the promised Jehovah has made to help us to keep improving the various things that we're doing with preaching the good news,

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.280
and also our spiritual feeding programs?

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.280
Yes, things continue to improve.

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:06.280
But let's also remember, have verse 16 in the same chapter starts.

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:12.280
It says, and you will actually drink the milk of nations.

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:23.279
We probably remember that the watchtowers helped us to understand that this milk of the nations involves all the things that are being developed, including modern technology.

00:04:24.279 --> 00:04:34.279
And Jehovah's people with Jehovah's blessing have used many of these modern things to help us with teaching and preaching.

00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:43.279
Yes, as Brother Splain said very accurately, times change and people's needs change.

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:51.279
And that's very true, as we've seen, reading skills have changed and learning skills have too.

00:04:51.279 --> 00:04:58.279
So for that reason, over the last few years, our Bible study tools have changed slightly.

00:04:58.279 --> 00:05:08.279
We've seen how they've become simpler, easier to use, and many of us are using videos along with these publications.

00:05:08.279 --> 00:05:15.279
But of course, sometimes it gets a little complicated because we're not quite sure what video to show when.

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:24.279
How refreshing it was when we saw that the digital version of the Good News brochure had videos embedded in it.

00:05:24.279 --> 00:05:30.279
So you're able to tap on the video and have the right video at the right time when you're conducting a study.

00:05:30.279 --> 00:05:38.279
Well, this new publication takes all of this experience that we've gained from trying to enhance our Bible study tools.

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:43.279
And now we have something that will be very easy to use.

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:48.279
But what does the publication look like?

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:57.279
And Brother Splain mentioned it had been field tested, so those who have already used it, what did they say about this new publication?

00:05:57.279 --> 00:06:01.279
And how does the governing body feel about this new publication?

00:06:01.279 --> 00:06:08.740
All those questions are answered in this video.

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:14.740
Jehovah has always given us the right tool at the right time to teach others.

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:27.819
And this new book is no exception. How is this book organized?

00:06:27.819 --> 00:06:35.819
Each lesson is divided into three parts. How do you use it to conduct a Bible study?

00:06:35.819 --> 00:06:44.819
You might encourage your student to read the first part of a lesson in advance and to note the questions in bold and the key scriptures.

00:06:44.819 --> 00:06:50.819
Begin each study by reading and discussing the first part together.

00:06:50.819 --> 00:06:55.819
Next, consider together the dig deeper section.

00:06:55.819 --> 00:07:05.819
Begin by reading the introductory statement, which explains what follows and take note of the subheadings that outline the main points.

00:07:05.819 --> 00:07:10.819
Read the scriptures. Watch the provided videos together.

00:07:10.819 --> 00:07:18.060
And then discuss how the scriptures and videos answer the related questions.

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:21.060
Discuss the artwork with the student.

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:25.060
Then follow with the questions found in the some people say section.

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:32.980
Then, read the summary and discuss the review questions.

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:37.980
Your student can enter the date the lesson was completed.

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:41.980
Each lesson provides a goal for the student.

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:48.980
And the explore section offers additional content that may be useful depending on your student's needs and interests.

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:54.980
Yes, this tool is very different. Why was it designed this way?

00:07:54.980 --> 00:08:01.980
It's a lot like the teaching used in artheocratic schools. It is very interactive.

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:08.980
On one hand, the lessons are written in such a way to really make the student think about what he is learning.

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:13.980
This tool has the ability to involve the Bible student.

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:18.980
It shows them a video and then they have references they can look at.

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:22.980
But the way that it's designed involves them.

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:26.980
And it really is going to give them a good foundation.

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:37.980
On the other hand, the teacher can use the viewpoint questions to draw out how the student really feels about what he's learning from God's Word.

00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:49.980
This is the most thoroughly field-tested publication that we have ever produced from writing the text to simplifying the text, polishing it, getting it ready.

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:58.980
It has been produced so that it can be translated into many languages so as to help people everywhere.

00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:03.980
Yes, this tool is very different. But is it effective?

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:10.980
Hundreds of publishers in almost 100 lands tested the lessons. What do they say about it?

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:15.980
I love the new layout. It's current and it's intuitive.

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:21.980
And the way the Bible truths are presented, it's very logical and easy to understand.

00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:24.980
I think it's going to be a game-tanger.

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:31.980
The dig deeper section is amazing. It ensures that the teaching comes directly from the Bible.

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:42.980
Because this part of the study becomes a conversation, the students answer right from their hearts, which allows me to learn a lot more about how they think and feel.

00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:47.980
The new method really helps us to convince the mind and reach the heart.

00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:54.980
Most of all, it helps both the teacher and the student to focus on the scriptures rather than on the study.

00:09:54.980 --> 00:10:04.980
We never heard anybody say the paragraph says, because when they did answer the question, they were expressing what they really believed.

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:11.980
The lessons are both logical and concise. The method is highly interactive.

00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:20.980
The students not only respond in their own words, but are also able to come to the correct conclusions all by themselves.

00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:28.980
It helps me as the teacher to talk less, and it helps the student to express himself and to think.

00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:36.980
And the videos are listed in the comment sometimes in even a personal nature that probably never were to come out, had it not been for the videos.

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:47.980
The aim is to get an archiehover, to love chiehover, to learn what his will is for us, and to do that will, and also to draw close to his organization.

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:57.980
I have been in full-time service for over 50 years. I conduct several Bible studies. These lessons cannot be compared with others.

00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:03.980
They are more effective and just what we need for our times.

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:08.980
It equips them to explain to others what they have learned.

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:18.980
And as a teacher, that fills me with so much joy that I am motivated to be zealous and find more new Bible studies.

00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:23.980
We are so excited about this new approach to teaching Bible truths.

00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:28.980
The main point stand out, the application is clear, and it's easy to remember.

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:34.980
And everybody can benefit from it, from those with little or no education to those who are highly educated.

00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:37.980
Our students are going to love this new publication.

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:44.980
And we will too, is this will make us better teachers of God's word, so as to make more disciples before the end comes.

00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:49.980
And how do members of the governing body feel about this innovative approach?

00:11:49.980 --> 00:12:01.980
This book has the potential to draw many honest hearted ones into Jehovah's organization, to serve alongside us in pure worship and dedicate their lives to Jehovah.

00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:07.980
Compared to all the Bible study tools we've used in the past, this is gold.

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:15.980
And that's what it's all about. Helping that student build a close relationship with Jehovah and unquestionably.

00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:24.980
This new publication, this marvelous gift from Jehovah, will help us accomplish this worthy goal.

00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:31.980
We recognize humbly that whatever tool we use, only Jehovah can make it grow.

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:41.980
So we're praying that Jehovah will grant success to this new tool to build and make disciples of Christ.

00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:49.980
We are not just preachers. We are teachers. We are disciples makers.

00:12:49.980 --> 00:13:02.980
This new book gives us what we need to help others love Jehovah, follow Christ, get baptized, and enjoy life forever.

00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:12.960
What a fantastic new publication. I'm sure all of us are looking forward to using it.

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:26.960
But you may be thinking, how big is it? How many pages are there? Well, there are 256 pages. And there are 60 lessons.

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:36.960
Well, you may be thinking, will that be overwhelming to many people when we show them this new publication?

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:44.960
Many of our Bible studies that we start do lesson one, two, and then by three, perhaps they stop studying.

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:54.960
So if we're using a large publication, could it be that it would be a waste of a publication if someone isn't going to continue to study?

00:13:54.960 --> 00:14:01.960
Wouldn't it be great if we also had something else that would introduce this new study system?

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:08.960
And that's exactly what we're happy to announce. The release of a new brochure entitled,

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:22.960
enjoy life forever introductory Bible lessons. Now this new brochure contains within it the first three lessons of the new publication.

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:31.960
When you look at the back of this brochure, you'll notice that it's designed similarly to the design of our tracks.

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:40.960
It has a question, is it possible to enjoy life forever? Would you say, yes, no, maybe?

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:50.960
The explanation is given below, along with the scriptures, help us then to direct the attention to the first lesson in the brochure.

00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:55.960
And this first lesson is entitled, how can the Bible help you?

00:14:55.960 --> 00:15:04.960
The second lesson is, the Bible gives hope, and the third lesson, can you trust the Bible?

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:09.960
What a wonderful way to introduce this new publication.

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:17.960
Since we've gone through the brochure, finish the three lessons. If someone shows that they really want to continue in their Bible study,

00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:23.960
then we introduce them to the larger publication and start at lesson number four.

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:35.960
Well, that's so exciting, isn't it? It will be very easy to use this, and also to use the electronic version, which has been developed the same time as the printed version.

00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:46.960
With the electronic version in JW Library, you'll be able to just tap the link, and it will take you to the videos, or to the verses, or to the reference material.

00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:57.960
Isn't that exciting? I'm sure all of us are looking forward to being able to use this new brochure and the new publication to start Bible studies.

00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:11.960
But there's still one question left. Wouldn't it be great if we can use these publications to help other persons to become disciples, yes, and to enjoy life forever?
