WEBVTT

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:12.259
Starting in May of last year, the JW Broadcasting Monthly Program has been available in many languages.

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:21.260
And the response from you dear brothers and sisters has been a great shout of appreciation to Jehovah.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:32.259
Please join us behind the scenes as we follow the translation process step-by-step.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:01:00.950
Our organization has been translating Bible-based,

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.950
printed material into hundreds of languages for many years.

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:11.950
Video has also been included as an important part of our modern global educational work.

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:18.950
But what unique challenges are involved in translation of a video program like JW Broadcasting.

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:27.950
Production of this program involves creating and translating more content on a monthly basis than we have ever done before as an organization.

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:33.950
This is required training additional teams to support the work internationally.

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.950
What are the steps involved in this process?

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:45.950
It starts when the teaching committee of the governing body approves the monthly program recorded in the studio.

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:51.950
The video recording of the program is then passed on to the translation packaging team.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.950
They prepare a number of items that together form a translation package.

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.950
For example, they create a transcript, which includes everything spoken in the program,

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:11.949
along with any notes and explanations to help the translators around the world carry out their work.

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:16.949
To make the translated program pleasing to watch and listen to,

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:21.949
translated audio and subtitles must match the original length of each statement.

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:27.949
For example, if Brother Lett speaks for 15 seconds in the original English recording,

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:32.949
the translated version needs to also be 15 seconds.

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:35.949
To help the translators in achieving that,

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:40.949
the original audio recording from our studio is broken into natural segments and timed.

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:45.949
That information is then added to the translation package.

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:52.949
The final package is double checked for accuracy and quality before it sent to translators worldwide.

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:56.949
The materials provided are used to immediately begin translation work,

00:02:56.949 --> 00:03:01.949
assuring that the same spiritual food is being provided in each language.

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:07.949
The translated narration is recorded in various locations and added to the original video files.

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:13.949
Other regions use subtitles, record translations of various sign languages,

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:16.949
or a combination of these methods.

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:20.949
Our brothers and sisters consider this assignment a great privilege,

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:25.949
knowing that it is helping Jehovah's people worldwide.

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:29.949
When we saw it in the Japanese, we all shouted,

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:34.949
there is a TB program which we can enjoy without worry.

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:37.949
We really appreciate this.

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:41.949
Now we feel closer to Jehovah and his organization.

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:45.949
And of course, it pulls together my family.

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:49.949
It touched my heart because it is in my own language.

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:53.949
It's really wonderful to know that this arrangement has been made.

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:58.949
It's easy to listen to, and now we only have to click to watch it in our own language.

00:03:58.949 --> 00:04:00.949
In the language.
