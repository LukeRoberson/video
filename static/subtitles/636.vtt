00:00:01.649 --> 00:00:09.289
What a joy to welcome all of you around the world wherever you might be to morning worship on this most important day of

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:12.410
2025 the memorial of Christ death

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:14.849
welcome

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.929
To begin our program brother Bob butler helper to the publishing committee will read our scripture text

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.489
Memorial Saturday, April 12th

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:29.449
The gift God gives is everlasting life by Christ Jesus our Lord

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:32.009
Romans 6 verse 23

00:00:33.609 --> 00:00:35.609
Thank you, Bob

00:00:35.609 --> 00:00:42.450
This evening we'll consider ways that we can show appreciation for the two greatest expressions of love in all history

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.149
Let's talk briefly about the gifts of forgiveness and everlasting life

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:51.490
Jehovah's forgiveness

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.250
Makes possible everlasting life

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:58.770
How many sins have you committed in your lifetime?

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.930
Are there times when you thought said or did something you shouldn't have or

00:01:05.569 --> 00:01:08.969
Didn't think say or do something you should have

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.569
We've all made innumerable mistakes in life

00:01:14.769 --> 00:01:19.329
But just to emphasize the point imagine that a person commits 10 sins a day

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:24.290
Maybe 10 is a bit conservative if we're honest about our own imperfection

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:31.250
But that's 10 sins a day 365 days a year. How many sins would that be in 25 years?

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:34.969
91,250

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:42.730
Can't forget about leap year add on six more days for a grand total of 91,310 and

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.370
That's just 10 sins a day

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.530
in 50 years it would be over

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.530
180,000

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.370
That's an enormous debt of sin

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.890
It certainly minimizes the few sins that our brother might commit against us

00:02:01.489 --> 00:02:06.290
Well the first part of our scripture text for today Romans 6 verse 23 says

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:10.569
The wages sin pays is

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:12.770
Death

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.009
Yes, sin earns us the death penalty

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:21.090
Now are we able to atone for or cover such sin?

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:29.650
Psalm 49 verses 7 and 8 provides the answer there it says bluntly none of them can ever redeem or

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.330
Buy back release liberate a brother or

00:02:33.889 --> 00:02:38.930
Give to God a ransom for him the ransom price for their life is so precious

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.129
Then it is always beyond their reach

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:48.129
Our situation was hopeless from a human perspective. We cannot redeem ourselves

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:53.610
It's frustrating when something we desperately need is beyond our reach

00:02:55.409 --> 00:03:01.050
But that's where Jehovah stepped in the second part of Romans 6 verse 23 says

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:08.169
The gift God gives is ever lasting life by Christ Jesus our Lord

00:03:09.169 --> 00:03:16.729
Our desperate predicament magnifies so much more the gift that God gives ever lasting life through the forgiveness of sins

00:03:18.169 --> 00:03:20.729
The Greek word here translated gift is

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.289
closely related to the Greek word often rendered undeserved kindness

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:31.770
Therefore gift could be rendered undeserved gift or gracious gift

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:37.129
Of course the emphasis is not on the unworthiness of the recipient, but rather

00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:40.169
on the generosity of the giver

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:43.490
Jehovah loved you

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:48.810
so much that he offered his only begotten son as a ransom sacrifice

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:53.930
The gift God gives is ever lasting life

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.889
But do you ever struggle with past mistakes wondering if Jehovah has truly forgiven you?

00:04:02.169 --> 00:04:05.969
Just how completely does Jesus sacrifice cover our sins?

00:04:06.969 --> 00:04:15.569
Jehovah provided a dramatic illustration during the annual atonement day in ancient Israel that can give us comfort and assurance even today

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:20.209
In Hebrew day of atonement literally means day of the coverings

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:24.449
Insight on the scriptures says the following under atonement day

00:04:25.689 --> 00:04:31.209
Visualizing the impressive events of the day makes possible a better understanding of what it meant to the Israelites

00:04:32.209 --> 00:04:37.370
Undoubtedly they were then moved to greater consciousness of their sinfulness and the need of redemption

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:45.170
As well as to a fuller appreciation of Jehovah's abundant mercy and making this arrangement to cover their sins of the past year

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:48.170
Leviticus chapter 16

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:50.410
describes the atonement day in detail

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:55.209
And Jehovah's organization has produced an excellent video entitled the tent

00:04:56.009 --> 00:04:58.970
That depicts many of the features you might want to review it

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:03.529
But there's another feature of the atonement day that we don't often think about

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:06.889
Leviticus chapter 16 verse 5

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:14.810
Says that Aaron the high priest should take from the assembly of the Israelites two young male goats for a sin offering

00:05:16.089 --> 00:05:20.170
So in this case the two goats together made up one sin offering

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:23.129
Let's now read verses 7 through 10

00:05:24.089 --> 00:05:26.410
Leviticus 16 verses 7 through 10

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:35.209
There it says he Aaron will then take the two goats and make them stand before Jehovah at the entrance of the tent of meeting

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:41.209
Aaron will draw lots over the two goats the one lot for Jehovah and the other lot for Azazel

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:47.529
Aaron will present the goat that was designated by lot for Jehovah and make it a sin offering

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:56.329
But the goat designated by lot for Azazel should be brought alive to stand before Jehovah in order to perform the atonement upon it

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:01.209
So that it may be sent away for Azazel into the wilderness

00:06:02.569 --> 00:06:05.129
Here we learn of the goat for Azazel

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:08.250
The footnote says that

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:11.930
Azazel possibly means goat that disappears

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:15.129
As explained in the following verses

00:06:16.009 --> 00:06:22.649
After Aaron sacrificed the bowl of the sin offering and made atonement for himself and for his house including the tribe of Levi

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:26.009
Then he sacrificed the first goat

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:27.610
The goat for Jehovah

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:36.009
With it he made atonement for the sins of the people and for the second goat the goat for Azazel that would be sent into the wilderness

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:42.329
Atonement for this live goat came from the blood of the goat that had just been killed as a sin offering

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:45.370
The life of the flesh being in the blood

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:52.569
The blood value or life value of the slain goat was transferred to the live goat or the goat for Azazel

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:55.930
What happened next?

00:06:56.009 --> 00:06:58.089
Notice please verses 20 through 22

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:01.290
verse 20

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:06.490
When he Aaron has finished making atonement for the holy place and the tent of meeting and the altar

00:07:07.129 --> 00:07:09.610
He will also present the live goat

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:14.490
Aaron will lay both his hands on the head of the live goat and confess over it

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:18.970
all the errors of the Israelites and all their transgressions and all their sins

00:07:19.769 --> 00:07:21.689
And he will put them on the head of the goat

00:07:22.329 --> 00:07:26.889
And send it away into the wilderness by the hand of a man designated to do this

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:32.569
The goat will carry upon itself all their errors into a desert land

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:35.930
And he will send the goat away into the wilderness

00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:43.930
The high priest confessed over the goat all the errors of the Israelites and all their transgressions and all their sins

00:07:45.529 --> 00:07:47.449
As the people listened to his words

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:50.730
No doubt they thought about their own sinfulness

00:07:51.689 --> 00:07:55.930
And mistakes they personally had made over the past year in fulfilling the mosaic law

00:07:57.850 --> 00:08:04.250
Can you imagine watching as the goat was led farther and farther from the tabernacle on that annual day of atonement

00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:09.930
Later in Israel's history the goat was pushed off a cliff to ensure that it wouldn't return

00:08:11.529 --> 00:08:13.529
The people watched attentively

00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:19.050
As the goat figuratively carried their sins into the wilderness never to be seen again

00:08:19.449 --> 00:08:26.730
The Israelites must have felt tremendous relief as they saw the live goat being led out of the camp

00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:30.889
Never to return what a remarkable illustration of Jehovah's

00:08:31.449 --> 00:08:34.419
forgiveness

00:08:34.419 --> 00:08:41.779
Of course there were times in Israel's history when the day of atonement meant so much more to individual Israelites

00:08:43.379 --> 00:08:44.580
For instance

00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:46.899
Imagine that you were King David

00:08:46.899 --> 00:08:50.820
Following his grave sin with Bathsheba and the subsequent murder of Eureia

00:08:52.659 --> 00:08:56.899
Although Nathan the prophet told repentant David that Jehovah forgave him

00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:02.659
Seeing the goat for a zeal go off into the wilderness during atonement day

00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:10.250
Must have been a great relief to David or think about repentant manasa

00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:15.850
Or what about the Jews in Josiah's day or Nehemiah's day

00:09:16.649 --> 00:09:20.490
Who came to realize how far they had deviated from God's law

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:26.250
No doubt the day of atonement brought them great comfort and assurance

00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:28.970
As they made straight paths for their feet

00:09:29.769 --> 00:09:32.649
And meditated on Jehovah's great mercy

00:09:35.269 --> 00:09:37.509
Why is this comforting and reassuring to us

00:09:38.789 --> 00:09:40.789
Thousands of years later

00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:43.669
Please turn with me to Isaiah chapter 53

00:09:45.269 --> 00:09:47.269
And let's note verses four and five

00:09:49.779 --> 00:09:51.779
Isaiah 53 four and five

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:55.779
Regarding the Messiah Isaiah prophesied

00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:58.580
Truly he himself carried

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:02.659
Our sicknesses and he bore our pains

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:06.980
But we considered him as plagued stricken by God and afflicted

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:12.580
But he was pierced for our transgression. He was crushed for our errors

00:10:13.139 --> 00:10:15.860
He bore the punishment for our peace

00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:19.059
And because of his wounds

00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:21.460
We or heal

00:10:22.419 --> 00:10:27.460
While the Jewish atonement day did not produce complete and permanent removal of sin even for Israel

00:10:28.259 --> 00:10:32.740
The various features of that annual celebration pointed to the grand atonement

00:10:33.379 --> 00:10:34.899
Made by Jesus Christ

00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:37.700
He served as the scapegoat

00:10:37.779 --> 00:10:42.259
He carried our sicknesses. He was pierced for our transgression

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:49.299
Yes, Jehovah covered our enormous debt of sin with Jesus ransom sacrifice

00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:52.870
We might illustrate it this way

00:10:54.149 --> 00:10:56.149
Imagine that you go out to dinner with friends

00:10:56.789 --> 00:11:01.830
And the same person pays the bill every single time. He says

00:11:02.789 --> 00:11:04.629
It's okay. I've got you covered

00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:08.230
Next time he says

00:11:08.629 --> 00:11:10.629
I'll pick up the tab

00:11:10.789 --> 00:11:12.309
Next time

00:11:12.309 --> 00:11:14.309
I'm paying the bill he says

00:11:15.669 --> 00:11:19.509
We become embarrassed when someone repeatedly covers our debt

00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:25.190
But we feel deep appreciation for the kindness and generosity shown to us

00:11:27.269 --> 00:11:31.110
Isn't that what Jehovah does for us on a daily basis

00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:35.100
Every sin

00:11:36.059 --> 00:11:38.059
Every mistake

00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:40.700
Every transgression if we're repentant

00:11:41.659 --> 00:11:44.220
Jehovah freely forgives us

00:11:46.899 --> 00:11:48.659
The price is paid Jehovah says

00:11:50.419 --> 00:11:54.220
I've got you covered

00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:57.980
For that reason the Apostle Paul could write at 1 Timothy 1 verse 15

00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:03.100
This saying is trustworthy and deserving of full acceptance

00:12:03.899 --> 00:12:06.779
Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners

00:12:08.139 --> 00:12:11.899
Christ sacrifice has the power to wash away even serious sins

00:12:12.779 --> 00:12:17.340
But why is it so important to accept and embrace the teaching of the ransom

00:12:18.379 --> 00:12:23.100
Because it's essential to our joy and contentment Jehovah wants us to serve him with rejoicing

00:12:24.299 --> 00:12:28.539
With a cleansed conscience we can render acceptable sacred service to Jehovah

00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:33.100
In ancient Israel the day of atonement was Tishri the 10th

00:12:33.899 --> 00:12:38.539
It's significant that the festival of booze has began less than a week later on Tishri 15th

00:12:39.259 --> 00:12:41.500
During that week-long festival

00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:44.700
According to Deuteronomy 16 verse 15 the people were to be

00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:47.340
nothing but joyful

00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:53.100
Because the day of atonement had been observed just five days earlier and their sins were covered or toned for

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:57.019
The people would have a sense of peace with Jehovah

00:12:58.379 --> 00:13:03.179
Joyful Thanksgiving was the distinguishing mark of the festival of booze

00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:07.460
What about us?

00:13:08.019 --> 00:13:14.019
Certainly during this memorial season we have moments of silent meditation to think about what God and Christ have done for us

00:13:14.659 --> 00:13:20.259
We're motivated to cultivate and show our appreciation for the undeserved gift of everlasting life

00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:27.779
We also let go of the sins of others toward us. We do not want to accept Jehovah's undeserved kindness and miss its purpose

00:13:29.139 --> 00:13:33.379
Yet we also rejoice in Jehovah's mercy and forgiveness

00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:39.460
We demonstrate the joy of Holy Spirit. We agree with King David who expressed at Psalm 32 verse 1

00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:46.740
Happy is the one whose transgression is pardoned whose sin is covered

00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:50.970
So what have we considered?

00:13:52.090 --> 00:13:54.330
The wages sin pays is death yes

00:13:55.690 --> 00:14:00.490
But the gift God gives is everlasting life by Christ Jesus our Lord

00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:05.610
And the day of atonement in ancient Israel assures us that Christ sacrifice

00:14:06.090 --> 00:14:08.090
completely takes away our sins

00:14:09.210 --> 00:14:12.409
Comforting thoughts as we prepare our heart for the memorial

00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:20.679
As brother Butler reads the printed comments please note how Jesus offered a corresponding ransom

00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:26.179
On our own we could never redeem ourselves from sin and death

00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:29.860
So at great cost to himself and to his dear son

00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:33.940
Jehovah reigns for Jesus to give his life in our behalf

00:14:35.299 --> 00:14:38.980
The more we meditate on what Jehovah and Jesus sacrifice for us

00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:41.860
The more we will appreciate the ransom

00:14:43.059 --> 00:14:48.820
When Adam sinned he forfeited the prospect of everlasting life not only for himself

00:14:49.299 --> 00:14:51.299
But also for all his children

00:14:52.259 --> 00:14:54.419
In order to buy back what Adam lost

00:14:55.139 --> 00:14:58.259
Jesus offered his own perfect life as a sacrifice

00:14:58.419 --> 00:15:00.980
During his entire life on earth

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:06.019
Jesus committed no sin nor was deception found in his mouth

00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:08.980
At the time of his death

00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:14.019
Jesus perfect life corresponded exactly to the life Adam lost

00:15:15.379 --> 00:15:17.139
Thank you, Bob

00:15:17.139 --> 00:15:21.620
Now it's time for the memorial Bible reading which we will read in chronological order

00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:24.580
Please follow along

00:15:25.299 --> 00:15:30.899
The day of the unleavened bread now arrived on which the Passover sacrifice must be offered

00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:34.899
So Jesus sent Peter and John saying

00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:38.500
Go and get the Passover ready for us to eat

00:15:39.539 --> 00:15:41.539
They said to him

00:15:41.539 --> 00:15:42.899
Where do you want us to get it ready?

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:45.379
He said to them

00:15:45.379 --> 00:15:51.620
Look when you enter into the city a man carrying an earthenware water jar will meet you

00:15:52.259 --> 00:15:56.740
Follow him into the house that he enters and say to the landlord of the house

00:15:57.460 --> 00:15:59.460
The teacher says to you

00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:03.940
Where is the guest room where I may eat the Passover with my disciples

00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:08.820
And that man will show you a large furnished upper room

00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:11.700
Get it ready there

00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:17.220
So they left and found it just as he had told them and they prepared for the Passover

00:16:22.679 --> 00:16:25.799
Now on the first day of the unleavened bread

00:16:25.799 --> 00:16:30.200
When they customarily offered up the Passover sacrifice

00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:32.120
His disciples said to him

00:16:33.159 --> 00:16:35.960
Where do you want us to go and prepare for you to eat the Passover?

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:41.879
With that he sent two of his disciples and said to them

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:47.879
Go into the city and a man carrying an earthenware water jar will meet you

00:16:48.679 --> 00:16:54.539
Follow him

00:16:54.539 --> 00:16:58.379
And wherever he goes inside say to the master of the house

00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:00.700
The teacher says

00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:04.619
Where is the guest room where I may eat the Passover with my disciples

00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:09.579
And he will show you a large upper room furnished and ready

00:17:10.299 --> 00:17:12.299
Prepare it for us there

00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:19.660
So the disciples went out and they entered the city and found it just as he said to them

00:17:20.619 --> 00:17:23.019
And they prepared for the Passover

00:17:27.799 --> 00:17:33.559
So when the hour came he reclined at the table along with the apostles and he said to them

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:39.640
I have greatly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:46.359
For I tell you I will not eat it again until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God

00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:51.160
And accepting the cup he gave thanks and said

00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:56.200
Take this and pass it from one to the other among yourselves

00:17:56.680 --> 00:18:02.359
For I tell you from now on I will not drink again from the product of the vine

00:18:02.359 --> 00:18:04.359
Until the kingdom of God comes

00:18:06.740 --> 00:18:11.140
But look the hand of my betrayer is with me at the table

00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:15.460
For indeed the son of man is going his way

00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:18.819
According to what has been determined all the same

00:18:19.539 --> 00:18:22.740
Whoa to that man through whom he is betrayed

00:18:24.259 --> 00:18:29.940
So they began to discuss among themselves which one of them could really be about to do this

00:18:32.019 --> 00:18:34.019
Also he took a loaf

00:18:34.819 --> 00:18:36.420
gave thanks

00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:37.619
broken

00:18:37.619 --> 00:18:39.619
And gave it to them saying

00:18:40.579 --> 00:18:44.500
This means my body which is to be given in your behalf

00:18:45.299 --> 00:18:48.259
Keep doing this in remembrance of me

00:18:49.619 --> 00:18:52.099
Also he did the same with the cup

00:18:52.819 --> 00:18:55.140
After they had the evening meal saying

00:18:55.779 --> 00:18:59.779
This cup means the new covenant by virtue of my blood

00:19:00.259 --> 00:19:03.059
Which is to be poured out in your behalf

00:19:05.829 --> 00:19:09.750
However, there also arose a heated dispute among them

00:19:10.309 --> 00:19:13.430
Over which one of them was considered to be the greatest

00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:15.910
But he said to them

00:19:15.910 --> 00:19:18.789
The kings of the nations lord it over them

00:19:18.789 --> 00:19:22.789
And those having authority over them are called benefactors

00:19:23.670 --> 00:19:26.230
You though are not to be that way

00:19:26.789 --> 00:19:31.269
But let the one who is the greatest among you become as the youngest

00:19:31.829 --> 00:19:35.029
And the one taking the lead as the one ministry

00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:39.990
For which one is greater the one dining or the one serving

00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:42.230
Is it not the one dining

00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:46.069
But I am among you as the one serving

00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:51.430
However, you are the ones who have stuck with me in my trials

00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:53.990
And I make a covenant with you

00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:58.710
Just as my father has made a covenant with me for a kingdom

00:19:59.349 --> 00:20:03.269
So that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom

00:20:03.349 --> 00:20:07.190
And sit on thrones to judge the 12 tribes of Israel

00:20:09.029 --> 00:20:10.309
Simon

00:20:10.309 --> 00:20:11.430
Simon

00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:12.710
Look

00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:17.269
Satan has demanded to have all of you to sift you as wheat

00:20:18.069 --> 00:20:23.190
But I have made supplication for you that your faith may not give out

00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:27.670
And you once you have returned strengthen your brothers

00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:30.630
Then he said to him

00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:34.549
Lord I am ready to go with you both to prison and to death

00:20:35.509 --> 00:20:37.509
But he said

00:20:37.589 --> 00:20:41.589
I tell you Peter a rooster will not crow today

00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:45.750
Until you have denied knowing me three times

00:20:47.109 --> 00:20:49.109
He also said to them

00:20:49.109 --> 00:20:53.910
When I sent you out without a money bag and a food pouch and sandals

00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:57.109
You did not lack anything did you

00:20:57.990 --> 00:20:59.269
They said

00:20:59.269 --> 00:21:00.470
No

00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:02.470
Then he said to them

00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:05.910
But now let the one who has a money bag take it

00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:11.029
Likewise a food pouch and let the one who has no sword

00:21:11.029 --> 00:21:13.829
Sell his outer garment and buy one

00:21:13.829 --> 00:21:18.390
For I tell you that what is written must be accomplished in me namely

00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:21.349
He was counted with lawless ones

00:21:22.069 --> 00:21:24.869
For this is being fulfilled concerning me

00:21:26.069 --> 00:21:27.750
Then they said

00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:30.309
Lord look here are two swords

00:21:31.109 --> 00:21:32.470
He said to them

00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:34.470
It is enough

00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:39.750
On leaving he went as was his custom to the mount of olives

00:21:40.309 --> 00:21:42.549
And the disciples also followed him

00:21:43.910 --> 00:21:46.630
On arriving at the place he said to them

00:21:47.509 --> 00:21:51.829
Carry on prayer so that you do not enter into temptation

00:21:53.670 --> 00:21:57.029
And he withdrew from them about a stone's throw away

00:21:57.750 --> 00:22:01.670
And he bent his knees and began to pray saying

00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:07.589
Father if you want to remove this cup from me

00:22:08.549 --> 00:22:10.150
Nevertheless

00:22:10.150 --> 00:22:12.150
Let not my will

00:22:12.390 --> 00:22:14.390
But yours take place

00:22:15.109 --> 00:22:19.190
Then an angel from heaven appeared to him and strengthened him

00:22:20.150 --> 00:22:25.269
But he was in such agony that he kept praying more earnestly

00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:30.150
And his sweat became his drops of blood falling to the ground

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:34.920
When he rose from prayer and went to the disciples

00:22:35.559 --> 00:22:37.559
He found them slumbering

00:22:37.559 --> 00:22:39.079
Exhausted from grief

00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:41.720
He said to them

00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:42.920
Why are you sleeping?

00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:48.839
Get up and keep praying so that you do not enter into temptation

00:22:50.279 --> 00:22:52.279
While he was still speaking

00:22:52.839 --> 00:22:54.519
Look a crowd

00:22:55.319 --> 00:22:57.160
And the man called Judas

00:22:58.119 --> 00:23:00.680
One of the twelve was leading them

00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:03.079
And he approached Jesus to kiss him

00:23:04.279 --> 00:23:05.559
But Jesus said to him

00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:07.400
Judas

00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:10.519
Are you betraying the son of man with a kiss?

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:14.440
When those around him saw what was going to happen

00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:15.000
They said

00:23:15.799 --> 00:23:16.599
Lord

00:23:16.599 --> 00:23:18.200
Should we strike with the sword?

00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:23.240
One of them even struck the slave of the high priest

00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:24.680
Taking off his right ear

00:23:25.559 --> 00:23:27.960
But in reply Jesus said

00:23:28.839 --> 00:23:29.799
That is enough

00:23:30.759 --> 00:23:33.319
And he touched the ear and healed him

00:23:34.279 --> 00:23:38.839
Jesus then said to the chief priests and captains of the temple

00:23:38.839 --> 00:23:40.839
And elders who had come there for him

00:23:41.799 --> 00:23:45.720
Did you come out with swords and clubs as against a robber?

00:23:46.519 --> 00:23:49.880
While I was with you in the temple day after day

00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:51.720
You did not lay your hands on me

00:23:52.359 --> 00:23:56.119
But this is your hour and the authority of darkness

00:23:57.559 --> 00:23:59.720
Then they arrested him and led him off

00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:05.160
And they brought him into the house of the high priest

00:24:07.299 --> 00:24:09.460
But Peter was following it a distance

00:24:10.339 --> 00:24:13.380
When they lit a fire in the middle of the courtyard

00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:15.140
And sat down together

00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:16.740
Peter was sitting among them

00:24:17.619 --> 00:24:21.059
But a servant girl seeing him sitting in the light of the fire

00:24:21.779 --> 00:24:24.579
looked closely at him and said

00:24:25.539 --> 00:24:27.619
This man was also with him

00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:29.460
But he denied it

00:24:30.099 --> 00:24:30.579
Saying

00:24:31.299 --> 00:24:32.819
I do not know him woman

00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:37.619
After a short time another person saw him and said

00:24:38.339 --> 00:24:39.779
You two are one of them

00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:41.380
But Peter said

00:24:42.019 --> 00:24:43.859
Man I am not

00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:46.660
And after about an hour had passed

00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:50.019
Another man began insisting strongly

00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:53.779
Certainly this man was also with him

00:24:53.779 --> 00:24:56.660
For he is in fact a Galilean

00:24:57.299 --> 00:24:58.339
But Peter said

00:24:59.299 --> 00:25:01.940
Man I do not know what you are saying

00:25:03.140 --> 00:25:06.579
And instantly while he was still speaking

00:25:07.299 --> 00:25:09.299
A rooster crow

00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:13.380
At this the Lord turned and looked straight at Peter

00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:16.420
And Peter recalled the statement of the Lord

00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:18.019
When he had said to him

00:25:18.019 --> 00:25:19.940
Before a rooster crows today

00:25:20.579 --> 00:25:22.819
You will disown me three times

00:25:24.099 --> 00:25:27.539
And he went outside and wept bitterly

00:25:29.849 --> 00:25:33.450
Now the men who held Jesus in custody began to mock him

00:25:33.450 --> 00:25:34.490
Hitting him

00:25:34.490 --> 00:25:36.410
And after covering his face

00:25:36.410 --> 00:25:38.250
They kept asking

00:25:38.250 --> 00:25:39.450
Profuside

00:25:40.009 --> 00:25:41.609
Who is it that struck you

00:25:42.650 --> 00:25:45.609
And they said many other blasphemous things against him

00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:54.099
Certainly we are encouraged to know that we will all be united

00:25:54.099 --> 00:25:58.339
As Jehovah's happy people and observing the memorial of Christ death this evening

00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:02.099
Be assured that the governing body loves each of you

00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:07.779
May our father Jehovah bless you all on this special day for his people earth wide
