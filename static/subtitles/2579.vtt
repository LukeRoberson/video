00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:11.960
My name is Eden Hoff-Lohansso.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.640
I studied medicine at the University of Zurich in Switzerland,

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:20.539
and afterwards I specialized in orthopedic surgery.

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:27.379
I didn't believe in a creator because I believed that the species came into existence through evolution.

00:00:27.379 --> 00:00:33.380
By comparing the anatomies of various organisms, we recognized similarities.

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.740
To me, it was logical that there was a link between these similarities,

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.259
that it indicated that we descend from a common ancestor.

00:00:42.259 --> 00:00:47.420
After my studies in medicine, I worked in hospitals in surgical departments.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.219
In orthopedics, a large part of orthopedics involves the insertion of prosthetics

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:56.899
to replace joints that are sick or no longer work.

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:02.460
Because the knee not only bends in straightens, there is also a sliding movement,

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.420
a small rotation.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:12.019
With a prosthetic knee, we cannot achieve the complete mobility of a normal healthy knee.

00:01:12.019 --> 00:01:15.859
If we see someone skating or dancing,

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:20.019
we have to believe that there is a designer who is superior to us.

00:01:20.019 --> 00:01:24.540
For a foot to function properly, there has to be harmony between the joints,

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.379
the tendons, the muscles, and the nervous system.

00:01:29.379 --> 00:01:34.540
It's difficult to imagine that it could be the result of evolution.

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:37.459
When someone came to my home to speak about the Bible,

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:41.500
I found the arguments in favor of creation more logical.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:49.019
Also, I learned there are renowned scientists who have doubts themselves about the theory of evolution.

00:01:49.019 --> 00:01:53.540
By studying the Bible, I came to better know who God is.

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.739
It's like food. You have to taste it to know if it's good.

00:01:57.739 --> 00:02:03.219
Likewise, you have to study the Bible to realize that what it says is true.
