00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:14.949
I started to study the Bible in 1993. At that time I was 43 years old. I was married

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:20.710
for 19 years and I had two children. At that time I didn't know if I would become one

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:27.589
of Jehovah's Witnesses or not, but I accepted a Bible study.

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:32.270
My husband's request, I started studying the Bible at the same time, but I only studied

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:40.990
for about a year. Then I decided I'm going to stop. I asked him to stop studying too.

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:48.240
I told him, let's stop studying. This is not for us. We don't understand it.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:54.960
But in a very diplomatic and calm way, he said he would continue. When I realized he

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.439
would continue studying, I said to myself, well, all right then, just you wait and see.

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:05.840
If you really want to continue, I will somehow make you stop studying in a subtle way, but

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:13.000
I will do it. Just seeing him get ready to go in the field so as annoyed me so much. I

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.439
started burying him with household chores, asking him to help me more and more around the

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:30.010
house. But calmly and gently every time he would ask me if he could prepare for meetings.

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:34.569
And one time when he asked me if he could prepare for the meeting, yet again I got irritated

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:42.469
and said, you're not going to prepare now. We're going to clean the whole apartment thoroughly.

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:48.469
After we were finally finished at midnight, he asked me very calmly if there was anything

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:55.609
else he could help me with. It was not easy for him to deal with my efforts to force him

00:01:55.609 --> 00:02:03.209
to stop studying. And after he got up, I tried even harder. But he never retaliated, he

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:10.400
stayed calm and endured it. In this period, I was trying to understand

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:23.060
her reactions. But it wasn't easy for me. Here in her criticisms, those harsh replies,

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:31.580
I thought sometimes I think I'll just give up. It makes no sense to go on like this.

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:39.379
I said to the brother who was studying with me about this, I want to stop. And he encouraged

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:47.139
me. He said, no, no, don't stop. Don't quit. Continue, continue. Probably your wife will follow

00:02:47.139 --> 00:02:54.580
you. These conversations always encourage me. And when we were finished our study, I would

00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:02.180
see things from a different perspective. I always loved my wife and I wanted her to be by

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:12.800
my side. During this period, he often told me how much he loved me. Many times, yes, very often.

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:18.960
And sometimes he would ask me if I loved him too. There were times when I would answer him.

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:26.860
And there were times when I just smiled and said nothing. And I even thought, hey,

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:34.460
this guy really cares about me. I was impressed by his kindness. I was very impressed.

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:40.699
Many times, I was musing, well, as a man, he could hit me, he could be demanding,

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:48.060
you will sit down, you know? But no, he never did that. He never raised his voice. Never

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:55.900
spoke a mean word. Never. When she saw that I did not retaliate as in, I would not reply harshly

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:05.180
and I would not talk badly to her, then eventually she would calm down. In his calm and mild way,

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:11.020
he began inviting me to the meetings. He kept on inviting me and sometimes I was willing to accept.

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:19.019
Slowly, I started to attend the meetings. I was happy. I was very happy when she said she wanted

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:29.540
to resume her study. In August 2006, I started studying the Bible again. And in March 2007, I became

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:35.779
an unbaptized publisher. And in July 2007, I decided to get baptized.

00:04:39.649 --> 00:04:50.699
I served in the baptism department and I had the privilege to personally baptize my dear wife.

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:18.480
First Corinthians 134 says that love is patient and kind. Patients means, first of all, being patient

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:35.279
for months, years or maybe even decades. Never give up. Never consider someone as a lost cause.
