00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:09.039
Younger old, we need to consider the topic of thinking ability and how to develop it effectively.

00:00:09.039 --> 00:00:17.039
All of us can think. We can think about a lot of things. Some good and some bad.

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:23.039
It's not uncommon, even for an adult, to let his mind wander aimlessly.

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:29.039
Or a person may spend time thinking of frivolous matters of little substance.

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:39.039
That's what can happen to our thinking. But it doesn't always have a positive effect on our life or our future.

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:48.039
Though specifically addressed to a young man, the Bible book of Proverbs gives sound advice for all of us.

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:59.039
Proverbs chapter 1 verse 4 says to give a young man, for that matter any of us, knowledge and thinking ability.

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.039
What is thinking ability in this verse?

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:10.040
The Hebrew word translated thinking ability can be used in a bad sense or in a favorable one.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:18.040
So our mind and thoughts can be directed to a worthy, upright end, or just the opposite.

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:31.040
If we incline our thinking to aspects of Jehovah's will and purposes, we'll safeguard our own thinking ability, directing it into the right channels.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.040
How valuable is that type of thinking process?

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:41.040
Turn to Proverbs chapter 3 verses 21 and 22, which states,

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:49.040
safeguard practical wisdom and thinking ability. They will give you life.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:54.040
Thinking ability is not in the exclusive realm of the studious type.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:02:04.040
Throughout our entire life, we take an information by reading, seeing, hearing and experiencing things.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:13.039
And it's the way we take in information and react to it that shapes our individual behavior and personality.

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:19.039
Many persons have not used their minds for much more than the essentials of daily living.

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:31.039
But to succeed in life and in Jehovah's eyes, it's necessary that we learn to train, develop and guard thinking ability.

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:39.039
Consider how trained thinking ability might protect us when it comes to using the internet wisely.

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:51.039
While the internet can be an excellent tool for gathering knowledge, thinking ability, when properly exercised, will safeguard us from its harmful effects.

00:02:51.039 --> 00:03:02.039
For example, some popular social media sites contain short videos designed to deliver instant gratification.

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:14.039
If the viewer gets no immediate emotional reward, he is tempted to keep scrolling to find material that will give the desired effect.

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:25.039
Now over time, this can lower one's attention span, which may impede a person's ability to learn, retain and recall information.

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:31.039
None of us would want that to happen to us, would we?

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:45.039
Additionally, studies have shown that those who spend too much of their time with their electronic devices are more prone to stress, anxiety, depression or other mental health problems.

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:54.039
On the other hand, thinking ability can help us to work out ways to control our use of such technology.

00:03:54.039 --> 00:04:06.039
For example, God oriented thinking ability can help us to distinguish truth from misleading and false information.

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:13.039
Thus there is wisdom in what is stated in Proverbs chapter 2 verses 11 and 12.

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:26.040
Thinking ability will keep watch over you and discernment will safeguard you to save you from the bad course.

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:30.040
Why is this so important?

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:41.040
Well, thinking ability and discernment gives us perception and perception is closely related to our conscience.

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:55.040
What we have meditated on from God's Word and stored in our mind can mold our conscience, which is an inner mechanism to warn us of wrong actions or tendencies.

00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:00.040
In effect, our thinking watches over us.

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:06.040
Now notice how this is alluded to at Hebrews chapter 5 and verse 14.

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:19.040
Solid food belongs to mature people. To those who through use have their powers of discernment, that is their thinking, trained to distinguish both right and wrong.

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:27.040
All of us, both young and old, should think carefully about the following suggestions.

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:32.040
Firstly, grow in knowledge of Jehovah.

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:40.040
Proverbs 9 verse 10 says in part, knowledge of the most holy one is understanding.

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:46.040
Coming to know Jehovah is a blessing and a protection.

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:57.040
We need to pray to Jehovah for insight when we study, apply ourselves to Bible reading on a regular basis and immerse ourselves in the truth.

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:03.040
We should talk to Jehovah in prayer as our closest confident.

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:12.040
This means using our thinking ability to convince ourselves that Jehovah's advice is the best advice.

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:23.040
Because doing so will safeguard us when we're tempted, tested, or put into a situation where we know we must say no.

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:30.040
Remember who we are, what we stand for, and to whom we have dedicated our life.

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:38.350
Next suggestion, we need to continue to enhance our Christian personality.

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:41.350
This is important, but why?

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:48.350
Because people who love Jehovah will like and respect us for who we are.

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:52.350
And what kind of personality are we suggesting?

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:57.350
Did you note the expression Christian personality?

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:00.350
That means Christ-like.

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:06.350
We cannot go wrong by imitating Jesus in any way possible.

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:11.350
Recall that 1 Peter 2 verse 21 says,

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:22.350
To this course you were called because even Christ suffered for you, leaving a model for you to follow his steps closely.

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:36.350
Jesus' whole way of life, his attitudes, his values, his interactions with others, culminated into a personality that we should strive to follow closely.

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:41.350
We know well how we want to look when dressed for a special occasion.

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:46.350
We cloth ourselves with careful attention to details.

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:51.350
Colossians 3 verse 10 picks up on the illustration of clothing.

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:54.350
There it states,

00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:59.350
and cloth yourselves with the new personality.

00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:04.350
Similarly, Romans 13 verse 14 tells us,

00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:12.350
Put on the Lord Jesus Christ and do not be planning ahead for the desires of the flesh.

00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:16.350
We have to think about Jesus' personality constantly.

00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:22.350
It certainly does not come naturally to us in perfect descendants of Adam.

00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:25.350
It takes real thinking ability.

00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:32.350
Remember, in this case, we are not clothing ourselves just for one special occasion.

00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:35.350
This is to be our daily wardrobe.

00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:45.759
To the extent possible, with our imperfection, we continuously work to reflect Jesus' personality.

00:08:45.759 --> 00:08:47.759
Next suggestion.

00:08:47.759 --> 00:08:51.759
Give priority to our priorities.

00:08:51.759 --> 00:08:53.759
What does this mean?

00:08:53.759 --> 00:08:59.759
To accomplish things in life, we must have schedules, routines and priorities.

00:08:59.759 --> 00:09:05.759
For instance, at Bethel, much work is accomplished because of the daily routine

00:09:05.759 --> 00:09:10.759
and because of giving priority to spiritual matters.

00:09:10.759 --> 00:09:18.759
At Philippians 1 verse 10, Paul said to make sure of the more important things.

00:09:18.759 --> 00:09:25.759
All some thinking ability will help us to see the value of organizing our life each day

00:09:25.759 --> 00:09:30.759
to give priority to the most important things.

00:09:30.759 --> 00:09:32.759
Next suggestion.

00:09:32.759 --> 00:09:37.759
Keep a modest view of our own knowledge and experience.

00:09:37.759 --> 00:09:43.759
Thinking ability will help us to filter the information we let into our mind.

00:09:43.759 --> 00:09:47.759
The real test of whether our thinking ability has been properly trained

00:09:47.759 --> 00:09:51.759
is how we apply knowledge.

00:09:51.759 --> 00:09:54.759
So we need to be cautious in life.

00:09:54.759 --> 00:10:03.759
Ask questions, fact check, get advice, read, study and learn from Bible principles.

00:10:03.759 --> 00:10:08.759
And once we've accumulated knowledge, insight and thinking ability,

00:10:08.759 --> 00:10:13.759
modesty is involved in how we share it.

00:10:13.759 --> 00:10:17.759
The Apostle Paul said at Romans 12 verse 3,

00:10:17.759 --> 00:10:25.759
I tell everyone there among you not to think more of himself than it is necessary to think,

00:10:25.759 --> 00:10:29.759
but to think so as to have a sound mind.

00:10:29.759 --> 00:10:35.759
Yes, we need to display a modest outlook on our acquired thinking ability.

00:10:35.759 --> 00:10:39.759
Did you notice it said to think with a sound mind?

00:10:39.759 --> 00:10:46.759
Not an inflated mind, not thinking more of ourselves than is necessary to think.

00:10:46.759 --> 00:10:53.039
Another way to use thinking ability in this old world is to avoid debt.

00:10:53.039 --> 00:10:56.039
Now why is this our last point?

00:10:56.039 --> 00:11:01.039
Because material things are not the most important things in life.

00:11:01.039 --> 00:11:06.039
Many work themselves to death to gain material prosperity.

00:11:06.039 --> 00:11:11.039
However, as Christians, there's other work that's related to worship.

00:11:11.039 --> 00:11:14.039
We want to work ourselves to life.

00:11:14.039 --> 00:11:19.039
Yes, focused on everlasting life, yet ahead.

00:11:19.039 --> 00:11:25.039
It's true though that some money is needed to buy the necessities of life.

00:11:25.039 --> 00:11:29.039
Whether we're young and just starting to earn a living,

00:11:29.039 --> 00:11:33.039
or we're older and have been working secularly for years,

00:11:33.039 --> 00:11:38.039
we need to learn to manage and budget money.

00:11:38.039 --> 00:11:45.039
This involves using our thinking ability to separate needs from wants

00:11:45.039 --> 00:11:50.039
and being cautious about accumulating much debt.

00:11:50.039 --> 00:11:54.039
Remember, according to Proverbs 22 verse 7,

00:11:54.039 --> 00:11:59.039
the borrower is a slave to the lender.

00:12:00.039 --> 00:12:04.039
These few suggestions are but a sample of areas in life

00:12:04.039 --> 00:12:09.039
where we need thinking ability and discernment

00:12:09.039 --> 00:12:16.039
in order to analyze our situation, make decisions, and determine future plans.

00:12:16.039 --> 00:12:21.039
Always remember the advice of Proverbs 3, 21 and 22.

00:12:21.039 --> 00:12:26.039
Safeguard practical wisdom and thinking ability.

00:12:26.039 --> 00:12:28.039
They will give you life.

00:12:28.039 --> 00:12:34.039
Yes, and we may add, even everlasting life in God's righteous new world.
