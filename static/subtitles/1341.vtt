00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:10.429
Jesus said that the identifying mark of true Christians would be their love for one another

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:13.910
This was especially evident at our

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:32.570
2019 love never fails international conventions. I never expected the the welcome that we received that they were over 200 brothers in the airport

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:40.649
For me, it's like I'm a paradise already because the love I feel here wherever I turn this love

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:45.320
As I walked around the corner the

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:52.740
Reception of the friends the way they embraced me was something that I could not have expected. No one could have even described it to me

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:08.519
Mexico has a lot of different cultures, but here in this stadium

00:01:08.519 --> 00:01:12.319
We are one people united by love serving Jehovah

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:17.000
That's unique. It's wonderful and it's all thanks to love

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:24.379
It doesn't matter where we come from or what language we speak the language here is love

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:34.510
Our love of neighbor motivated us to share in a global preaching campaign

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:44.709
Foreign delegates worked shoulder-to-shoulder with hosts from the local city to invite millions of people from around the world to one of the

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.310
24 international

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.310
conventions

00:01:48.629 --> 00:01:52.750
This gave our brothers and sisters from different parts of the globe an

00:01:53.349 --> 00:01:55.349
Opportunity to get to know each other

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.390
United by the common goal of spreading the good news to everyone they've met

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:06.790
I worked in field service with the sister who used to study the Bible with a Brazilian woman

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:13.349
The sister had prayed to send a Brazilian sister to accompany her when we visited the woman together

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:21.349
She could see the love we have between us and the efforts we made to come so far to attend the convention here in Denmark

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:27.189
Over a million people attended the international conventions in many different languages

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.469
Both foreign and local delegates as well as newly interested ones

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.710
We're able to learn firsthand how love never fails

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.629
Clothe your cells with love

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.310
For it is a perfect bond of union

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:47.590
First love identifies us

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:51.819
humility

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:57.979
That's love in action. Loyal love is a beautiful aspect of Jehovah's personality

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.460
Well Jesus made it simple didn't he said

00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:05.419
Look for the love

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.939
Look for the love and you'll find the right religion

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:11.979
Christian love has power

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.580
It can reach hearts in ways that the spoken word cannot

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:26.219
But really what other group of persons on earth are interested in discussing love that doesn't fail

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:30.620
When someone sees us they should see a loving individual

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.500
When they see any one of us who are servants of Jehovah

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:43.719
And they should see love

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.039
In addition to spending time in the ministry

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.840
Activities were planned so that delegates could get to know their brothers better

00:03:57.449 --> 00:04:04.889
This gave delegates the opportunity to learn about the culture and our spiritual heritage in the host country

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:14.139
In some cities they visited exhibits and locations where previously our faith and love had been tested

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:16.779
For example

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:21.740
delegates in Berlin had the opportunity to visit socks and housing concentration camp

00:04:22.459 --> 00:04:25.579
Where many of our brothers were imprisoned during World War II

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.019
I thought it was especially amazing

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.540
Despite the circumstances of the brothers and sisters faced

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:36.139
Even their persecutors had to recognize the truth

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.620
Identify a mark of Christianity of love

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:47.449
This visit showed the faithful endurance our brothers and sisters demonstrated under vicious persecution

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:50.410
And the love they had for Jehovah

00:04:51.209 --> 00:04:54.490
A fitting example of love that never fails

00:04:55.449 --> 00:05:00.250
Adolf Hitler wanted to exterminate Jehovah's witnesses

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:02.329
He called them a brood

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:11.449
But instead Jehovah's witnesses are still here proving that Christian love never fails

00:05:15.079 --> 00:05:19.079
Another example of faith and endurance was seen in Seoul Korea

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:29.110
Since 1953 young Korean brothers have been imprisoned for refusing military service

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:36.899
Altogether, over 19,000 brothers who refused to compromise their faith

00:05:37.459 --> 00:05:40.819
Spent nearly 37,000 years in prison

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.139
Delegates were able to visit a neutrality exhibition

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:50.500
To learn more about the strong faith and unwavering courage these young brothers displayed

00:05:52.649 --> 00:05:55.209
On February 28, 2019

00:05:55.769 --> 00:05:58.250
The last of our imprisoned brothers were released

00:06:02.329 --> 00:06:06.490
Because I received a not guilty verdict just two weeks ago

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:09.290
I was able to attend this international convention

00:06:10.089 --> 00:06:12.089
I am so grateful to Jehovah

00:06:13.769 --> 00:06:18.009
My son receiving this acquittal enabled him to attend this convention

00:06:18.569 --> 00:06:20.810
We never imagined this would be possible

00:06:22.009 --> 00:06:27.689
What a joy it was for these brothers to attend this historic international convention

00:06:28.089 --> 00:06:31.529
Alongside their families and thousands of foreign delegates

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:37.850
Just being able to sit next to my son for the convention completely fills my heart

00:06:49.129 --> 00:06:51.769
Despite an ongoing economic crisis

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:58.009
Many delegates from Venezuela were able to attend the international convention in Sao Paulo, Brazil

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:05.079
Coming from Venezuela, it's difficult to earn a living or save money

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:10.120
We have to sell our electronic devices and work long hours to be here

00:07:10.759 --> 00:07:13.480
But these sacrifices will always be worth it

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:24.040
The love we show to our brothers is possible because of the love Jehovah shows us

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:29.800
An expression of his love to us comes in the form of his word the Bible

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:33.079
In Copenhagen, Denmark

00:07:33.079 --> 00:07:37.160
Delegates from Iceland were delighted to receive a special gift

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:45.160
We are happy to announce a release of the Icelandic New World Translation of the Christian Greece

00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:56.810
Additionally, at several 2019 international conventions

00:07:57.370 --> 00:08:02.889
Our brothers received the revised New World Translation in the language of their heart

00:08:37.059 --> 00:08:39.539
I can really feel the love from Jehovah

00:08:40.019 --> 00:08:46.340
He's given us this wonderful gift because he wants us to know that the words in this book are from him

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:53.779
The conventions also gave thousands the opportunity to express their love for Jehovah

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:57.299
By symbolizing their dedication to him through baptism

00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:05.929
The love amongst our brothers was evident to onlookers as well

00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:11.370
The police directing traffic had less work than they normally do

00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:17.610
The atmosphere was so contagious that they started greeting foreign and local delegates

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:20.330
They were so happy

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:23.850
They said this country does not need more police

00:09:24.409 --> 00:09:27.129
What it needs is more Jehovah's Witnesses

00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:38.809
Our 2019 international conventions have given us an opportunity to demonstrate how Jehovah's love motivates us to love

00:09:40.899 --> 00:09:43.379
Well as we approach the end of this system of things

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:46.980
We're going to need love more than ever before

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:50.100
Of course we need loyalty

00:09:50.899 --> 00:09:55.860
Of course we need endurance and of course we're going to sing that song of courage

00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:58.580
But remember what else we want

00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:02.789
Jehovah's loyal love

00:10:02.789 --> 00:10:04.950
May we be determined to imitate him

00:10:05.669 --> 00:10:14.470
In letting our love never ever fail all to Jehovah's glory
