00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:07.849
On February 24, 2021, the Abakan city court convicted 70-year-old Valentin Abaranovskaja and

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:09.650
her son, Roman.

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:11.890
Both are Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:17.329
They were cruelly and inhumanly sentenced to two and six years in prison, respectively.

00:00:17.329 --> 00:00:20.809
There is no way that it can be said that they committed any crime.

00:00:20.809 --> 00:00:22.809
They were just practicing their religion.

00:00:22.809 --> 00:00:27.210
Following the verdict, they were immediately taken into custody from the courtroom.

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:35.130
Sadly, three months later, the appeal court upheld the unjust verdict.

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.490
Soon, Valentin Abaranovskaja will be transferred to prison for two years, and her son, Roman,

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:40.490
for six years.

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:45.490
When the ruling was announced, someone was crying quietly, because it was impossible to

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.609
accept this without tears.

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:55.369
It lies outside the realm of human reason that they could possibly be extremists.

00:00:55.369 --> 00:01:01.969
Why did they imprison such an old and sick woman and for that long?

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:07.010
Her sentence is the first one in modern-day Russia where a court has convicted and imprisoned

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.129
a female witness for her faith and a 70-year-old at that.

00:01:11.129 --> 00:01:16.010
She is also the first witness to be imprisoned for participating in not organizing a band

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:17.329
organization.

00:01:17.329 --> 00:01:21.370
Prior to this, Jehovah's Witnesses, who were accused of violating this article, were

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:25.170
fined or given a suspended prison sentence.

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.489
The main grounds for prosecuting Valentina and her son are once again the Supreme Court

00:01:30.489 --> 00:01:38.810
decision, which I would call egregious, that was handed down on April the 20th, 2017.

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:44.090
On page 32 of the decision, the Supreme Court specifically noted that the ruling did not

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:50.650
interfere with or violate the rights of citizens to meet together or worship freely.

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:55.769
Nevertheless, the courts of the Russian Federation, who are using this decision, are totally

00:01:55.769 --> 00:02:01.170
ignoring the language in that section.

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.370
The charges were based on the evidence of one woman who, pretending to want to study

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:12.250
the Bible, recorded everything on camera, all their discussions and handed it over to

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:13.849
the FSB.

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:18.729
The criminal case against Valentina and Romana was initiated in April 2019.

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:24.810
Her home was subsequently searched, then in July 2020, due to being under constant stress,

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.810
Valentina suffered a stroke.

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.930
She was hospitalized and then they discovered that she had hard problems as well.

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:38.090
But despite those circumstances, the courts still decided that she needed to be imprisoned,

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.370
isolated from society.

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.370
Sometimes they had to call an ambulance five or six times a week because her blood pressure

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:51.490
would skyrocket and she would have problems with her heart.

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:56.009
Despite Valentina's health problems and advanced age, the detention authorities forced her

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:58.330
to wash the floor of herself.

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.930
According to their friends, Valentina and Romana are managing to stay positive despite

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.289
being imprisoned and separated.

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:09.930
In letters, Valentina relates that she eagerly awaits the time when they will be released

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.650
and reunited.

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.889
Romana is very worried about his mother.

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:19.449
I know that for now, while they're still in the pre-trial detention facility, they

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:22.530
are allowed to write to each other.

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.330
The Baranovsky's handled this persecution in a praiseworthy manner.

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.090
They never panicked.

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:34.449
They remained calm and muted as something to be expected and whatever Christians should

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:36.169
be ready for.

00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:42.250
Every time I met Valentina, I never heard her express any negative sentiments with regard

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.409
to her persecutors.

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:49.370
She understands what is happening and why it is happening.

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:55.729
But she will not renounce her faith just to make life easier, although she was given

00:03:55.729 --> 00:04:01.449
the opportunity to do so in the course of the investigation.

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:06.810
Even the shameful and inhumane verdict did not frighten Valentina and Romana.

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.530
They remain loyal to their faith.

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:13.889
Their friends hope that justice will soon be restored and that this elderly mother and

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:16.730
her son will once again enjoy freedom.
