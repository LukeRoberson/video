00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:07.809
During the 1970s, the preaching work was not recognized in Rwanda.

00:00:07.809 --> 00:00:12.810
When my family and I received a letter of invitation to go serve there,

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:14.810
we were living a good life.

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:19.809
We had some concerns, but praying to Jehovah

00:00:19.809 --> 00:00:23.809
and asking him for direction helped us.

00:00:23.809 --> 00:00:30.809
I discussed it with my wife and we were both positive about it.

00:00:31.809 --> 00:00:35.810
We made a request for legal recognition in 1982,

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:42.810
but instead, myself and two other brothers were thrown into prison.

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:48.810
One day, on a Sunday, the Archbishop came to the prison and he announced,

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:52.810
the wear of those Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:57.810
As a result of that, he raised the curiosity of his listeners.

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:04.810
The prisoners wanted some explanations from us because they could not understand what he meant.

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:11.620
Many began to join our meetings.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.620
The Archbishop was not happy.

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:21.620
He grew even angrier and in order to stop our activities,

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:29.510
he told his close followers to beat us up when we attended the following meeting.

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:33.510
Two young prisoners approached us and they said,

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.510
today, they planned to beat you up.

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:43.019
When our meeting time came, we didn't show up.

00:01:43.019 --> 00:01:46.019
Another religious group came and took our place at night,

00:01:46.019 --> 00:01:48.019
so they were the ones who got beaten up.

00:01:48.019 --> 00:01:52.019
From that time on, no one disturbed us any longer.

00:01:52.019 --> 00:01:56.019
We continued preaching and attending meetings peacefully.

00:01:56.019 --> 00:02:03.930
After spending two years in prison, we were freed.

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.370
Outside of prison, the brothers were not free to preach.

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:14.370
Many more brothers and sisters kept being arrested and imprisoned.

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:21.370
Later, I was put in prison again and the imprisoned brothers rejoiced over my presence,

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.370
saying, we now have our circuit overseer visiting us.

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.370
They were very happy.

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.370
We started working together in harmony and preaching.

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.370
Each one was assigned a territory.

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.370
Some were discouraged,

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.370
but I tried to strengthen and encourage them to hold on to Jehovah.

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:51.969
Then, brothers from all over the world started to write to the head of state.

00:02:51.969 --> 00:02:54.969
Letters were coming in huge quantities.

00:02:55.969 --> 00:02:57.969
Those letters had a good impact,

00:02:57.969 --> 00:03:03.969
because finally, one day, an announcement was made on the radio by the president himself,

00:03:03.969 --> 00:03:06.969
saying that he pardoned Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:03:06.969 --> 00:03:09.969
The people on the street started shouting at us.

00:03:09.969 --> 00:03:11.969
Jehovah has won.

00:03:11.969 --> 00:03:13.969
Jehovah has won.

00:03:13.969 --> 00:03:14.969
He has won.

00:03:14.969 --> 00:03:26.449
The work of Jehovah's Witnesses was legally recognized in 1992.

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:34.300
Sadly, in 1994, during the time of genocide,

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:42.030
some of our brothers died and others faced serious challenges.

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.030
Some fled to Goma as refugees.

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:53.030
I received the assignment to oversee the relief funds that were coming from Kinshasa.

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:59.030
One day, I had just collected the relief money for our refugee brothers,

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.030
and I was stopped by two policemen.

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.030
They possibly thought that they could get that money,

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:10.340
so they asked me to go with them to their superior.

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:18.939
As we were walking, I remembered a prayer that our daughter Debra said during the genocide.

00:04:18.939 --> 00:04:22.939
While the whole family was praying silently,

00:04:22.939 --> 00:04:26.939
she prayed out loud, pouring her heart out to Jehovah.

00:04:26.939 --> 00:04:31.939
Thanks to that, they refrained from killing us.

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:36.939
This moved me to pray in my heart, too.

00:04:36.939 --> 00:04:39.939
As soon as I said, Amen.

00:04:39.939 --> 00:04:44.939
The two policemen turned right and went to meet their colleague.

00:04:44.939 --> 00:04:48.939
I also saw in front of me a brother holding a black suitcase,

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:52.939
looking exactly like the one I had with the money.

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:57.939
I handed him mine full of money, and he gave me his with literature inside.

00:04:57.939 --> 00:05:02.939
Then, without delay, the policemen said, let's go now.

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:07.939
Let's go. We walked all the way to the chief of police, but they found nothing.

00:05:07.939 --> 00:05:11.939
They were holding their chins in their hands, saying,

00:05:11.939 --> 00:05:16.939
this is a miracle. How could the money we saw turn into books?

00:05:16.939 --> 00:05:23.939
In all the trials I've encountered, I really saw Jehovah's powerful hand.

00:05:23.939 --> 00:05:27.939
As a house built on a rock that is struck by storms,

00:05:27.939 --> 00:05:31.939
hit by anything but remains firm.

00:05:31.939 --> 00:05:34.939
We too met with many trying challenges.

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:40.939
But Jehovah continued to make us firm just like a house built on a rock.

00:05:40.939 --> 00:05:48.889
A scripture founded Isaiah 54 verse 17 explains that in reality.

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:53.889
All those fighting against us, no matter who they are,

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:57.889
will never succeed. Up until this moment,

00:05:57.889 --> 00:06:01.889
although my physical strength is gradually fading,

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:05.889
I feel that the power to serve Jehovah is growing so much.

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:09.889
In fact, I feel more powerful than ever.

00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:13.889
My determination is that, no matter the situation,

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:16.889
I will continue to serve Jehovah.
