00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:09.980
Like many older ones before them, younger brothers and sisters are taking on challenging assignments that bring them rich spiritual rewards.

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.980
We go next to India, to hear from brother Francis Rodrigs.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:21.980
He's using his training from the School for Kingdom Evangelizers to teach people in the Indian Sign Language field.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.980
When I was younger, there were two special pioneers who were assigned in the nearby congregation,

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.980
and I was seeing how happy they were in serving Jehovah.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:37.979
I had a choice to make, to work overseas, but I decided to serve Jehovah in the full-time service.

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:42.979
In the special full-time service, Jehovah is taking care of all my needs.

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:50.960
I try to be a useful tool in his hand and let him use me wherever he wants me to be used.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:57.399
From the past one year, I have been assigned to the Indian Sign Language field.

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:00.399
I have been to almost 20 untouched territories.

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:06.420
We start with the Deaf Search at 7 in the morning.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.420
It's most of the people in the villages are farmers and they come back for a short break.

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:22.920
We freeze till 9 or 9.30 in the night, and then I travel overnight to another village.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.920
And at 7, we again start with the Bible studies.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.920
This I do four times a week.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.920
There was a Deaf School where we were giving memorable invitations.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.920
Some students just come running towards us and they do like Jehovah love.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.920
And we are like, how do you know us?

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.920
Because we never met those school children.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.920
Then we saw a boy who had just attended the meeting once.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.920
When he came to the school and told all his friends about it.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:57.920
And they were like, please you come once to this place and teach us more about Jehovah.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.920
Sometimes we meet the Deaf ones who have never been to school.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.920
So sometimes we make their parents sit with them and we see how they communicate with each other.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.919
And then we adapt to their sign language.

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:12.919
Another place which is 10 hours far from here.

00:02:12.919 --> 00:02:16.919
Initially it was just two or three Deaf people who were interested.

00:02:16.919 --> 00:02:19.919
But later on it started increasing.

00:02:19.919 --> 00:02:22.919
We would have the first Bible study at 7 in the morning.

00:02:22.919 --> 00:02:24.919
Turned by turn everyone would come.

00:02:24.919 --> 00:02:28.919
Sometimes there would be so many of them that we would have 10 to 12 in a group.

00:02:28.919 --> 00:02:30.919
And we would have a Bible study with them.

00:02:30.919 --> 00:02:33.919
We had to end the Bible study at 8.30 in the night.

00:02:33.919 --> 00:02:38.919
Because I had a 10-odd train journey back home.

00:02:38.919 --> 00:02:41.919
We planned to visit the branch office.

00:02:41.919 --> 00:02:45.919
And after the two of the Deaf girls started crying.

00:02:45.919 --> 00:02:48.919
They said they love that this weather sister showed us.

00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:52.919
Now we feel that Jehovah is the only true God.

00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:55.919
Since then they are making many changes in their life.

00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:59.919
And now one of the girls is an unbaptized publisher.

00:02:59.919 --> 00:03:02.919
When I see the Deaf ones doing changes in their life.

00:03:02.919 --> 00:03:06.919
They are being happy and also having a good relationship with Jehovah.

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:08.919
That makes me more happier.

00:03:08.919 --> 00:03:14.229
There are many challenges in their assignment.

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:17.229
Sometimes I have to travel 10 hours to a village.

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:19.229
And traveling does make me tired.

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:24.379
Sometimes the trains are overly packed.

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:27.379
Many times the late by almost three hours.

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:31.379
Or sometimes even cancel due to which we have to go back home.

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:33.379
Challenges will come.

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:35.379
But they will also go.

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:37.379
I try not to get stuck on them.

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:40.379
I pray to Jehovah not to remove these challenges.

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:43.379
But to give me the strength to overcome these challenges.

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:48.379
I feel that challenges are nothing when compared to the benefit that I see.

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:52.379
When I focus on that, I really enjoy my assignment.

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:58.419
Brother Rodriguez searches for those rightly disposed forever lasting life.

00:03:58.419 --> 00:04:02.419
Wherever he can find them, despite the obstacles.

00:04:02.419 --> 00:04:07.419
And you may have noted that his joy comes from directing people to the congregation

00:04:07.419 --> 00:04:10.419
to be part of our true spiritual brotherhood.

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:13.419
That example is repeated millions of times over

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:18.420
through the diligent efforts of publishers and pioneers around the world.

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:22.420
Why not examine your ministry to find ways to help yet more people

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:25.420
to build a good relationship with Jehovah?
