WEBVTT

00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:08.949
Jehovah wants your family to be happy and peaceful, but Jehovah does more than simply say I hope you have a peaceful family life

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:13.230
He explains exactly how we can get our family there. I

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:21.269
Want you to imagine Jehovah laying out a map in front of you and saying see these landmarks look for them on the road to peace

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:24.429
And if you see them, you're going in the right direction

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:30.309
So far in this symposium we've passed the landmarks of show love and respect

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:34.429
Improving communication and working together as a team

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.590
The last landmark we'll consider in this symposium is

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:41.310
Worshiping together as a family

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:46.869
Worshiping together as a family promotes peace and brings his blessing

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:54.549
Even if not all in your family or worshipers of Jehovah you can promote peace by maintaining a very good spiritual routine

00:00:55.549 --> 00:01:06.629
In the following dramatization notice some common obstacles to worshipping Jehovah as a family. Hi

00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:22.450
Hey, babe. So what's for family worship this week? I think I got some good ideas. Yeah

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:26.409
Thank you for reading that

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:35.269
She's got to ask the question. We'll just do that. So a paragraph 13 and 14. How can we be generous?

00:01:36.269 --> 00:01:45.269
Anybody? Now the footnote that we just read really helps us to appreciate

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:47.909
the definition of that quality

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:56.150
Without the definition we're left to wonder exactly what it is and how it connects to the other things that we've discussed this evening

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.299
Again, can you go ahead and read the next one first?

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:10.389
Thank you. The Bible contains many examples of submissive individuals

00:02:11.389 --> 00:02:13.389
So are there examples?

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:25.060
Sue? Yeah, that's right. When we talk about examples, where do we start? There's examples in the past

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.020
There's even examples

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:29.860
presently and

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.860
We could even be examples

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:41.139
That's that's the power of them. Let's keep going

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:56.379
That was a lot of reading. I know right. I want to enjoy family worship, but I

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:02.460
I feel like the things that we are covering are just really not what I need right now

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:06.460
Yeah

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:08.939
You know, I just don't know if this is what they need right now

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:25.349
We'll keep working on it. I think we'd all agree that family worship was difficult to watch

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.830
It was uncomfortable for everyone

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:35.110
Clearly Max and Irene had some obstacles. They needed to overcome to really worshiping Jehovah as a family

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:40.310
To start and keep a good habit going requires determination and resolve

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:43.349
So that's where you need to start for your family

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:48.389
You need to resolve that you're going to worship Jehovah as a family

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:54.389
Notice the resolve in Joshua's words at Joshua chapter 24 and verse 15

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:58.789
As Joshua chapter 24 and verse 15

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.509
Now if it seems bad to you to serve Jehovah

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.509
Choose for yourselves today whom you will serve

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:11.990
Whether the gods that your forefather served on the other side of the river

00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:15.830
Or the gods of the Amorites and whose land you're dwelling

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.110
But as for me and my household

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:21.990
We will serve Jehovah

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:29.370
Yes worship of Jehovah's a family needs to be at the very center of your family life

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:34.810
Now weekly family worship is not all that's involved in worshiping together as a family

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:40.569
Let's consider five ways we can worship together Jehovah as a family

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:44.170
one prayer

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:49.290
Parents do not underestimate the impact that your prayers have on your children

00:04:50.649 --> 00:04:57.449
When a child hears their parents pour out their hearts to Jehovah that tells them that Jehovah's very real to their parents

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:02.009
I can recall growing up listening to my father's prayers

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:05.769
Now when I was young I thought his prayers were very long

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:10.810
But as I grew older and really listened carefully to what he was saying

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:15.850
I could see how much of a close relationship he had with Jehovah

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:19.259
two

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:24.860
Discuss the daily text it's an excellent habit and a very spiritual way to start the day

00:05:26.459 --> 00:05:31.660
Three attending meetings now not just make sure our family is there at the meetings

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:39.740
But they're involved engaged and work hard to prepare so all family members can have a meaningful comment at the meetings

00:05:41.579 --> 00:05:45.019
For share in the ministry regularly as a family

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:50.379
Now sharing in the ministry together as a family draws us closer to our family members

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:53.180
When we hear them speak about the truth

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:57.579
We listen to their phone calls or we read their letters

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:00.300
We can feel their faith

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:07.740
I loved going in the ministry with my mother and listen to her skillfully use the Bible to answer questions

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:16.300
And five have a consistent, enjoyable and meaningful family worship program

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:19.899
Let's consider what that means first of all consistent

00:06:20.939 --> 00:06:25.100
In the video max was trying to have the family worship consistently each week

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:28.459
Is your family worship consistent each week

00:06:30.459 --> 00:06:31.980
Is your family worship enjoyable

00:06:33.019 --> 00:06:34.939
In the video the kids were bored

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:38.459
They were looking at their phones checking the time

00:06:39.339 --> 00:06:42.379
And week after week of kind of a question and answer style

00:06:42.939 --> 00:06:45.660
led to the young people giving sort of one word answers

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:48.540
It did not look enjoyable

00:06:48.939 --> 00:06:52.779
Now would your family describe family worship as enjoyable

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:56.620
How about meaningful

00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:01.740
What max was using for material was merit material that he thought was meaningful

00:07:02.939 --> 00:07:05.740
But did it look like it was meaningful to the family

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:11.100
Does your family worship use material that is meaningful to your family

00:07:13.019 --> 00:07:17.339
Now after reviewing these five points, we don't want you to be discouraged

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:20.220
If it's a struggle to maintain a good routine

00:07:21.339 --> 00:07:25.500
Life in this system has many challenges trials and unexpected events

00:07:26.379 --> 00:07:27.899
So stays positive

00:07:28.459 --> 00:07:31.019
And when your good routine breaks down from time to time

00:07:31.579 --> 00:07:37.660
Consider what adjustments you can make to be successful and get your spiritual routine back on track

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:42.379
Regularly ask Jehovah for his help and don't give up

00:07:43.899 --> 00:07:46.300
Now as you watch the following dramatization

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:52.300
Notice how max and Irene and the family work together to make family worship successful

00:07:57.509 --> 00:07:59.910
March 15th 2014 watch tower

00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:05.139
Family worship can you make it more enjoyable

00:08:06.579 --> 00:08:09.620
The worship of Jehovah should not be boring

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:14.019
Address the needs of each family member

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:19.829
Babe, what are our kids need?

00:08:22.009 --> 00:08:24.009
What's actually going on in their lives

00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:27.290
Family worship needs to include that

00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:31.930
Maybe we need to pay more attention to what's going on with them

00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:34.090
Talk to them

00:08:34.809 --> 00:08:39.139
Listen to them

00:08:39.139 --> 00:08:42.580
I'm gonna send you a link to a great watch to our article. I can't wait to read it

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:48.980
Max and I changed our approach

00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:55.129
We found out what mattered to our kids

00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:01.509
Like friends

00:09:01.509 --> 00:09:03.509
Adjusting to a blended family

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:14.340
Dating

00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:19.460
So we turn things around and use family worship to focus on what our kids really needed

00:09:33.899 --> 00:09:36.940
And to prepare ourselves for possible future trials

00:09:52.139 --> 00:09:55.580
Good night, tell good night good night good night

00:09:56.779 --> 00:09:58.779
um

00:09:59.179 --> 00:10:02.220
Family worship was was cool. It was

00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:05.820
I'm glad you liked it

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:07.259
Thank you

00:10:07.259 --> 00:10:08.539
Good night, tell

00:10:08.539 --> 00:10:10.860
night good night

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:12.379
Hey, guess what

00:10:12.379 --> 00:10:13.899
What

00:10:13.899 --> 00:10:15.659
What

00:10:15.659 --> 00:10:17.659
I applied to Bethel

00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:18.620
You did?

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:19.419
Yep

00:10:19.419 --> 00:10:21.419
That's really exciting

00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:24.779
I'm proud of you

00:10:24.779 --> 00:10:25.580
Thanks

00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:30.220
Congratulations

00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:33.799
Thank you

00:10:33.799 --> 00:10:35.320
Hey, selfie time everybody

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:38.919
All right on three, we're gonna say Bethel, okay?

00:10:38.919 --> 00:10:39.399
All right

00:10:39.399 --> 00:10:40.919
All right

00:10:40.919 --> 00:10:41.720
One

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:42.600
Two

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:43.559
Three

00:10:43.559 --> 00:10:44.759
Bethel

00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:06.570
We've come a long way

00:11:19.379 --> 00:11:22.340
And through it all, Jehovah has taught us to love

00:11:24.259 --> 00:11:25.700
And he's given our family

00:11:26.740 --> 00:12:41.320
Peace

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:46.840
We can see that Max and Irene analyzed what was wrong with family worship and decided to change their approach

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:51.399
Let's examine how they did that and what it means for us

00:12:52.679 --> 00:12:57.000
What did they do to make their family worship more meaningful

00:12:58.039 --> 00:13:00.120
Well, Max and Irene had to ask themselves

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:02.840
What's going on in their kids lives

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:08.759
What topics could they discuss at family worship that would truly be useful to their kids

00:13:09.879 --> 00:13:14.840
Did you smile when you saw Max almost drop the glass? What his daughter talked about dating

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:23.399
But what a difference their efforts to listen and really understand what was happening with the kids made in the family worship

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:28.200
How did Max and Irene make family worship more enjoyable

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:32.919
Did you see how the family was reacting at family worship now

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:35.960
What a difference

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:37.720
The kids were smiling

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:42.200
They looked engaged in the discussion and touched by what they were discussing

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:48.200
So do what you can to make sure that your family feels relaxed and happy

00:13:48.919 --> 00:13:53.399
And that your family worship reflects the kind of happy and joyful God that Jehovah is

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:59.960
Remember your family will often remember more about how they felt during family worship

00:14:00.519 --> 00:14:03.480
Then maybe the exact details of what they learned

00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:07.450
Keep worshiping Jehovah's a family

00:14:08.090 --> 00:14:10.090
Make your family worship consistent

00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:12.330
enjoyable and meaningful

00:14:13.049 --> 00:14:15.610
And work together to overcome obstacles

00:14:17.129 --> 00:14:24.330
Just like Max and Irene and the kids all worked together to solve problems and create a very peaceful family life

00:14:25.129 --> 00:14:29.769
It was really beautiful to see how far they had come by applying Bible principles

00:14:30.649 --> 00:14:32.169
In review

00:14:33.049 --> 00:14:38.889
This symposium has taught us that Bible principles can be used as a road map to family peace

00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:42.330
Work hard to show love and respect

00:14:43.129 --> 00:14:49.049
To improve communication to work together as a team and to worship Jehovah together

00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:56.250
And please be patient with one another as you form habits that lead to peace

00:14:56.250 --> 00:15:02.809
With Jehovah's help you and your family will enjoy peace that only he can provide
