00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:06.879
During the 2015 annual meeting, an announcement was given

00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:09.880
that would affect Bethel's around the world.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.880
The governing body has directed that a number of our branch

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.879
and assembly hall construction projects were all wide,

00:00:18.879 --> 00:00:26.879
be delayed, reduced in scope, or in some cases cancelled.

00:00:26.879 --> 00:00:29.879
The governing body had two clear objectives in mind

00:00:29.879 --> 00:00:31.879
with these changes.

00:00:31.879 --> 00:00:35.880
Firstly, that of making the best use of dedicated funds,

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.880
but ultimately giving even greater emphasis

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.880
on the preaching and the teaching work.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.880
In fact, here in Britain, we were on the brink of starting

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.880
construction on a new branch office,

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.880
and we really wondered how these simplifications

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.880
would affect the construction projects.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.880
To understand why these changes were important,

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.880
we first need to take a look at how Bethel's function.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.880
The field ministry is a fundamental part of our worship

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.879
to Jehovah.

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:06.879
Bethels are there to support that work.

00:01:06.879 --> 00:01:10.879
Bethel's key departments provide tools and training needed

00:01:10.879 --> 00:01:15.879
to carry out the preaching work and support and defend our rights to do so.

00:01:15.879 --> 00:01:22.879
Some of these departments are service, audio video, local design and construction,

00:01:22.879 --> 00:01:25.879
translation and legal to mention a few.

00:01:25.879 --> 00:01:29.879
In turn, none of these could function without the support of departments

00:01:29.879 --> 00:01:35.879
such as purchasing and accounting, computers, maintenance and kitchen,

00:01:35.879 --> 00:01:42.879
and home departments which care for the welfare of the many volunteers working in Bethel.

00:01:42.879 --> 00:01:49.879
So any simplifications made to Bethel would ultimately benefit the activity in the field.

00:01:50.879 --> 00:01:56.879
Branch committees around the world were asked to reduce the size of their Bethel families.

00:01:56.879 --> 00:02:03.879
And this required us to rethink the way we work and the way we live at Bethel.

00:02:03.879 --> 00:02:09.879
Simplified meal arrangements has meant that Bethelites now prepare some of their own meals.

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:15.879
Likewise, in many branches, they are responsible for caring for their own laundry.

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:19.879
They now also look after their own housekeeping.

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:23.879
Many more commuters and remote volunteers are being used to carry out work

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:27.879
that previously would have required a permanent Bethelite.

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:32.879
These and other changes have resulted in making better use of donated funds

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:35.879
but ultimately benefiting the preaching work.

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:39.879
The Bethel family has really responded very well to these changes

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:43.879
and we can see how the direction given to us from the governing body

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:47.879
is really benefiting our brothers and sisters in the field.

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:52.879
And those who have been reassigned to the field are doing really well in their assignments.

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:57.879
So how did this announcement affect the Branch Relocation Project underway in Britain?

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:02.879
When the announcement was made in 2015, plans were very well advanced.

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:09.879
This meant that we need to put the project on hold while new requirements for Bethel were evaluated.

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:15.879
This effectively led to a redesign and a reduction in the scope of the project.

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:19.879
For example, the Bethel kitchen and dining spaces became more compact

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:23.879
as they were now largely preparing food for only one meal a day.

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:26.879
Rather than three, there was no need for a central laundry

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:31.879
as these would be cared for by the individuals in their own private accommodations.

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:35.879
Rather than a large dining room that's only used for one hour a day,

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:39.879
or notatorium only used one hour a week,

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:49.879
now a large multipurpose event space was planned which could be flexibly reconfigured for various uses.

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:53.879
Offices could also be reconfigured either as private offices

00:03:53.879 --> 00:04:00.879
or as large open work spaces with relatively little reconstruction required.

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:06.879
The governing body was very clear that as adaptive needs of the organization came about,

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:09.879
they wanted to make these changes quickly.

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:17.879
We trust that the lessons learned from our project may aid in other branch projects to follow.

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:23.879
In summary, we can see that Bethels around the world support the preaching and teaching work

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:28.259
and these changes are evidence of that.

00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:31.259
Well at Philippians chapter 1, verse 10,

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:36.259
we're told to make sure of the more important things.

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:45.259
We desire to give priority to those activities that contribute the most to the spiritual welfare of God's people

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:49.259
and the advancement of the global preaching work.
