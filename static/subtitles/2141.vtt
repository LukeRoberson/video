Please help me to keep running

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:30.329
Because we're moving fast

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:34.329
When we face opposition

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:39.329

At the start of each new day

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:24.760
But something always happens

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.489
There is a challenge

00:01:28.489 --> 00:01:30.489
Seem out of control

Let's see the blessings flow

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:11.460

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.460
