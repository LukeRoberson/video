00:00:07.469 --> 00:00:11.470
All of you will be stumbled in connection with me on this nice night.

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:19.260
Peter thought he was strong and would never make Jehovah sad.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.260
But doing the right thing isn't always easy.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:29.579
I'll never make Jehovah sad.

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:36.679
We know you never want to.

00:00:36.679 --> 00:00:40.679
What if Jehovah doesn't want to be my friend anymore?

00:00:41.679 --> 00:00:43.679
Peter knew the right thing to do.

00:00:43.679 --> 00:00:46.679
But he was afraid and did the wrong thing.

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:49.990
But he didn't give up.

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:51.990
Do you know why?
