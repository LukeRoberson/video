00:00:01.419 --> 00:00:10.140
One of the main reasons for the construction of theocratic facilities is to support the

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:19.820
never-to-be-repeated work of finding honest-hearted ones who want to learn more about Jehovah.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:26.420
One such individual is brother Steve Gertis from the United States.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:36.020
As a young man, his life spun out of control and his lifestyle left him feeling empty.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.539
But what did he do to find purpose in life?

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:45.609
Let's find out.

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:50.490
I grew up in a small town and I had a good childhood.

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:58.289
My parents instilled in me from a young age a love for God and a respect for the Bible.

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:04.409
We were regular church attenders and I went to a private school and I had Bible classes

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.010
each and every day.

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:12.530
Despite all of this, however, I felt like something was missing.

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.769
When I was 15, my life changed in a moment's notice.

00:01:17.769 --> 00:01:26.129
I was playing high up in a tree, the branch broke, I fell to the ground and I was paralyzed.

00:01:26.129 --> 00:01:32.250
At that moment, I went from an active kid who could run to one who was paralyzed from

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.650
his neck down.

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.689
I couldn't feel anything.

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:43.450
By the time I was 18, I gained enough physical strength in my arms that I once again had

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.890
my independence.

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:51.890
At that point, I attended a university and lived on campus.

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.969
My life changed dramatically once again.

00:01:55.969 --> 00:02:05.170
Here I was exposed to drugs, alcohol, immorality and I fell into that lifestyle.

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.050
Every night, though, I still read the Bible.

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.569
I still had this strong faith in God.

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:18.810
But when I prayed and went to sleep at night, I just knew I was going to end up in that

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:25.620
hellfire that I had been taught from an early age.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:32.460
During this time, I met a girl named Julie and we were married shortly after.

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:37.900
She was in the same hippie lifestyle that I was in and we knew if we were going to stay

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.780
married, we had to move away from our bad influence.

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.379
We were looking for God and we wanted Him in our life.

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:50.620
One day I was in the park by myself.

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.300
It was a beautiful setting.

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:58.219
There was a lake in front of me, mountain in the background and at that point, I said

00:02:58.219 --> 00:02:59.699
a prayer to God.

00:02:59.699 --> 00:03:06.939
I told Him that we wanted to serve Him, but we just didn't know how.

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:12.300
About ten minutes later, a guy walked up and he started talking to me about a parent

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.259
I served.

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:15.939
Everything he said made sense.

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:18.699
I had read it before.

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:23.860
The thing that really stood out to me was his explanation on hellfire.

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:29.099
It was so clear, it was so logical, it just made sense to me.

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:33.699
He invited us to the kingdom hall the next day and we went.

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:39.419
My wife and I will never forget that first meeting 37 years ago.

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:43.419
I had my long hair, holes in my jeans.

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:47.139
I don't think I even wore shoes that first time.

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:52.379
Because we're sitting there, I'm thinking that the older brother who's conducting on

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:57.740
stage, he's going to find us so disgusting.

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:01.659
But to our surprise, right after the meeting, he came up.

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:06.580
He greeted us and invited us to spend time with his family.

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:11.340
We don't remember anything that was said at that meeting, but we'll never forget the

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:12.539
greeting.

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:18.139
We immediately started attending all the meetings at the kingdom hall and also began a Bible

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:22.019
study with the brother we met in the park.

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:28.379
The changes in our lifestyle did not come overnight, but the brothers were so loving and patient

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:29.779
with us.

00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:32.699
We now had a purpose in life.

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:37.980
The emptiness that I had felt for so long was no longer there.

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:42.180
We no longer had to live in that self-centered lifestyle.

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:47.420
Now we had Jehovah, we had the brothers, we had the ministry.

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:52.699
We made our dedication to Jehovah and were baptized.

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:57.500
Julien, I have had a fruitful ministry over the years.

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:02.939
It's always been one of our goals that we and our two younger children would be able

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:06.420
to one day regular pioneer together.

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:12.899
We discussed, could we make a move to Mexico and serve where there was a greater need?

00:05:12.899 --> 00:05:19.019
We knew there would be challenges with accessibility and learning a new culture.

00:05:19.019 --> 00:05:25.139
So we made the decision to try it as a family for one year and now four years later we are

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:29.939
all still serving in the full-time ministry here in Mexico.

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:37.379
I also live with pain every day and some thought that I would not have the physical strength

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:39.180
to make such a move.

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:45.579
But I always remember that when I'm in the ministry I don't feel the pain.

00:05:45.579 --> 00:05:51.500
In fact my children have said that I hope dad never has to stop pioneering because that's

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:54.899
when he's the happiest.

00:05:54.899 --> 00:05:59.939
Everything really seems to be getting easier for me, not harder.

00:05:59.939 --> 00:06:06.060
I know this isn't because of my strength but it's Jehovah's Holy Spirit.

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:12.300
I still love the parks as I did when I was young but now I have the opportunity to share

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:15.579
the wonderful Bible hope with others.

00:06:15.579 --> 00:06:22.300
I'm so thankful to Jehovah that he heard that prayer in the park many years ago.

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:28.860
My life is now filled with peace, happiness and contentment.

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:35.019
And now I look forward to the time soon when we're in the paradise.

00:06:35.019 --> 00:06:44.540
I can get rid of this wheelchair and I can run once again.

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:52.139
Brother Gertis has been serving as an elder for the past 25 years and as a regular pioneer

00:06:52.139 --> 00:06:53.779
for the last 13 years.
