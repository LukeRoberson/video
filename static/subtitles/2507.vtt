00:00:46.259 --> 00:00:56.770
know what could have happened. Caleb, whose house is this?

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:57.929
Jehovah's house.

00:00:57.929 --> 00:01:06.959
Imagine this was your house, and you invited your friends over, but they broke all your

00:01:06.959 --> 00:01:10.400
toys.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:16.439
These are my planes, okay?

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.680
How would Jehovah feel if you were running and poor sister Elsa got hurt?

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:27.519
You can't fix her if she breaks, so no running in the kingdom hall.

00:01:27.519 --> 00:01:29.920
Besides, you need to save your energy.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:30.920
I do.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.000
On your marks, get fit.
