00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:22.620
All the shiny things that we see

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:26.620
Promise us pleasure and security

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:30.620
But if we wanted all there's a cost

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:34.619
We could be slaves through what we've bought

00:00:34.619 --> 00:00:36.619
Let's keep it simple

00:00:36.619 --> 00:00:38.619
Jehovah knows what we need

00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:40.619
Let's keep it simple

00:00:40.619 --> 00:00:45.109
Keep it simple

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:48.420
And you and I keep it simple

00:00:48.420 --> 00:01:12.879
So nice one, we are satisfied with simple things

00:01:12.879 --> 00:01:15.879
We'll feel the joy and peace it brings

00:01:15.879 --> 00:01:17.879
Let's keep it simple

00:01:17.879 --> 00:01:29.650
Jehovah's keep it simple

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.909
Keep it simple

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:47.359
God's us if we trust and wise

00:01:47.359 --> 00:02:17.699
He feels to live the simple life

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:21.699
Our hearts are happy and our loaves are light

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:25.699
With all this weight taking off our chest

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:28.699
We're free to give our God our best

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:30.699
Let's keep it simple

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:42.259
Jehovah's keep it simple

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:51.240
Keep it simple

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:59.500
Keep it simple
