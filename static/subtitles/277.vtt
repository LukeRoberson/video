00:00:05.389 --> 00:00:29.269
I've always enjoyed my work, and even the people I worked with, it's hard to

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:35.750
balance work and meetings. But since I was baptized, I've always done my best

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:49.149
to be there. My wife is a great support, and we work hard to teach our children.

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:55.189
They've been my greatest joy. I want to make sure that they're cared for. I

00:00:55.189 --> 00:01:03.140
believed that if I worked hard enough, I'd always be able to provide for my

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:13.349
family. But my boss wanted more than I was willing to give. He insisted that I

00:01:13.349 --> 00:01:23.849
work Sundays during my meeting. I needed this job. My wife and I were worried.

00:01:23.849 --> 00:01:33.819
What would happen if I lost it? I was determined to take a stand for my meetings.

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:52.549
I spoke to my boss and explained my decision. But he refused to compromise. I was shocked. I

00:01:52.549 --> 00:02:04.489
didn't think this was how it was supposed to go. How would I support my family? Paul studied the

00:02:04.489 --> 00:02:13.289
Bible with me. We've been close ever since. He invited me out, and I guess he'd heard about what

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:25.259
happened. He really listened as I poured out my concerns. I wondered if I should have just

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:32.379
done what my boss insisted. I would have missed my meeting, but I still could have attended

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:41.479
an evening meeting and a different congregation. My skills were limited, and there just weren't

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:48.000
that many jobs out there for me. I told him I was seriously considering a job that would

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:59.409
involve a lot of travel. Paul read to me from Matthew chapter 6 verses 25 to 33.

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:07.330
Stop being anxious about your lives as to what you will eat or what you will drink or about

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:14.689
your bodies as to what you will wear. Keep on then seeking first the kingdom and his righteousness,

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:23.969
and all these other things will be added to you. He reminded me that as a newly baptized witness,

00:03:23.969 --> 00:03:29.569
my prayers are much more readily received, and Jehovah was ready to respond.

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:39.710
He encouraged me to include Jehovah in my decision. Patience is not easy for me,

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:51.229
but I decided to look to Jehovah to provide the right job. So every day I kept looking.

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:27.120
But work never came. I never thought that it would go on so long. Eventually, I had to go on

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:33.759
unemployment insurance so we could get by. I knew that I was doing the right thing,

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:50.500
but I couldn't help feeling that I was letting my family down. One night, I was reminded of Jesus

00:04:50.579 --> 00:04:59.970
words in Matthew chapter 6. Observe intently the birds of heaven.

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:08.129
They do not so seed or reap or gather into storehouses, yet your heavenly Father feeds them.

00:05:09.329 --> 00:05:18.500
Are you not worth more than they are? I realized that I was still relying on myself

00:05:19.379 --> 00:05:27.779
and not fully throwing my anxiety on Jehovah. My skills may be limited, but Jehovah's are not.

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:38.339
So I kept on looking, but I used my extra time to auxiliary pioneer. It was just what I needed.

00:05:39.379 --> 00:05:45.779
Eventually, Jehovah opened the door and blessed my patience with a job that was nearby with

00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:50.980
good hours for my meetings. I even had more time for the ministry with my family.

00:05:52.339 --> 00:05:58.180
It was not an easy experience, but my faith in Jehovah was stronger than ever.

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:08.180
I saw him act in my behalf, and I know that he really does care for me and my family.
