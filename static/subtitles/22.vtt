00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:06.200
Welcome brothers and sisters to JW Broadcasting. This month you'll get a

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.439
behind-the-scenes look at the filming of the report on Typhoon Haiyan. You'll

00:00:11.439 --> 00:00:15.279
also see the effort our brothers put forth to preach in one of the

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:20.839
remotest parts of the earth. And touching interviews will show that Jehovah

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:26.320
truly cares for his people even if they for a time become separated from his

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:52.090
organization. This is the November edition of JW Broadcasting. We begin our

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:58.090
program by revisiting the Philippines. Two years ago this month Typhoon Haiyan

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:05.010
devastated that country and many of the 185,000 witnesses living there were in

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:11.010
the direct path of the storm. The effort our brothers made to search for and

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:17.049
provide relief to fellow Christians was remarkable. What did it take to bring

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:23.819
that story to the worldwide brotherhood? Typhoon Haiyan struck the Philippines

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:28.540
early morning on Friday in November the 8th. Less than a week later the

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.099
governing body already decided they wanted a video to help document the

00:01:32.099 --> 00:01:35.540
relief efforts as well as brother Sanderson's visit to encourage the

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.140
friends. With the Philippines Typhoon Haiyan's story it was very important to

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.659
turn it around quickly because it's a current news event and all the people the

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:47.379
brothers and sisters there that were suffering we hoped it would be very

00:01:47.379 --> 00:01:52.219
encouraging for them to get this story quickly as well as a witness for the

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:55.620
country. As soon as we received official permission from the writing committee

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:59.500
we immediately sent out memos to the Philippines branch as well as to the

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.900
Korean branch. We started to engage them in video conferences but I was a

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.620
little bit of a challenge because the Philippines is 13 hours difference in

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:14.539
Korea's 14 hours difference. When we first were asked to do this project I

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:19.099
think we felt somewhat underqualified in the Philippines but when we started

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:23.620
thinking about how important it was to do this video and for the brothers all

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.740
over the world to know what was happening to their brothers in the Philippines

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:32.139
and how they were being helped well that helped us get a feeling that this had

00:02:32.139 --> 00:02:37.300
real priority and we really needed to do what we could to help. We decided to

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.139
use a small crew from the Korean branch. They had the plan purchasing it

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:49.379
everything ready to go within two weeks time. It was much worse than we had

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:57.930
thought before we arrived there. I thought it was too severe to be true. Many

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:06.500
houses of witnesses and kingdom halls were totally destroyed. It was not so

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:12.219
easy getting into those disaster areas after the typhoon because it just tore

00:03:12.219 --> 00:03:16.300
the infrastructure apart in that area so for example the airport in

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:23.500
Takloban city was pretty much half destroyed. As we can imagine when they went

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.620
into this area this was a disaster area so it can be very overwhelming. So while

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.979
the team from Korea was shooting we would interact with them given them ideas

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:38.539
of what type of shots to get and be able to focus their attention when in the chaos.

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.740
It worked well. We were able to get done what was needed to be done and in a

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:47.099
reasonable amount of time.

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:55.860
We had brought two cameras however when you arrived in the Philippines our

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:01.539
second camera suddenly didn't work. The main camera worked very well during

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:08.139
whole shoot. Afterwards we realized that using two cameras would only have

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:15.180
slowed down our working pace. Another big challenge that we had in connection

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.060
with the video equipment was that in most areas that we went to where there

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:24.740
was so much destruction there was no electricity. So obviously we had to

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:29.740
keep on shooting but there was no place to plug in. On one occasion the

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.259
brothers at the Kingdom all had a little generator so we were able to rev

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:37.379
that up at night, plug in our equipment and get it recharge so the next day

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:43.819
then we were able to go on with the shootings. We worked for over 15 hours a day.

00:04:43.819 --> 00:04:51.139
Our future brothers were always with us so we felt safe. We really

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:56.220
appreciate the brothers who assisted the project in many ways such as the

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:01.459
brother who drove even at the very late night and the brother who arranged the

00:05:01.459 --> 00:05:08.810
older scheduling having them we could finish the project successfully. We found

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:14.810
it was getting easy to find encouraging stories as we were interviewing more and

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:20.769
more local brothers. Through those preacher building conversations we came to

00:05:20.769 --> 00:05:26.050
obviously realized what makes Philippine brothers overcome their difficulties

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:34.050
and we all agree the same things also made us encourage much as well. That is

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:40.290
definitely Jehovah's powerful and loving spirit. We never became too tired to

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:45.449
keep up our tight schedule despite tropical hot weather and sad situation

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:56.319
out there. We could feel that he imparted power beyond what is normal to us. Once

00:05:56.319 --> 00:06:00.399
the team from Korea was done gathering the footage the next step was to get all

00:06:00.399 --> 00:06:04.959
of that footage back to us here. There was eight hundred and eighty eight gigabytes

00:06:04.959 --> 00:06:08.639
worth of material almost a terabyte which is about twenty hours worth of

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:11.279
footage. Sometimes that's a challenge when you have such a large amount of

00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:15.279
material to not be overwhelmed is to know where to start. So having a good plan

00:06:15.279 --> 00:06:18.319
figuring out what your focus is that was the first step we needed to realize what

00:06:18.319 --> 00:06:23.199
is the theme we want to focus on in these stories. Not the tragedy of it but the

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:28.939
faith that was shown the resilience that the people had. We would go through

00:06:28.939 --> 00:06:34.379
the footage and we would take screenshots of some of these happy laughing faces

00:06:34.379 --> 00:06:40.740
and print out those images and then put them on backboards all around the room

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:46.100
so that we would keep our focus on the stories of the faith and resilience that

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:54.939
we want to emphasize. The challenge with this particular video was that there

00:06:54.939 --> 00:06:58.899
was such an abundance of faith strengthening and encouraging stories that you

00:06:58.899 --> 00:07:02.579
didn't want to cut any of it out. And yet we don't have time to tell every single

00:07:02.579 --> 00:07:08.379
story. When we looked at the things that we posted around the room the pictures

00:07:08.379 --> 00:07:12.540
the images of people the plans the story boarded sequences it was so

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:17.899
encouraging because these brothers and sisters they had lost literally lost

00:07:17.899 --> 00:07:21.139
everything and all they had were the muddy clothes on their back and they

00:07:21.139 --> 00:07:24.259
were living dozens in the same kingdom hall and yet they were happiest

00:07:24.259 --> 00:07:40.790
could be with smiling faces and focusing on spiritual things. We had to decide

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:47.149
which pieces we wanted to focus on when everything was so powerful. When you

00:07:47.149 --> 00:07:52.389
watch the video at first you're not hearing our recognizable song or melody

00:07:52.389 --> 00:07:56.629
you're just hearing these chords they do happen to be the chords that come from

00:07:56.629 --> 00:08:04.819
song number 60 in our book he will make you strong. The risk factor in using the

00:08:04.819 --> 00:08:08.740
song is that because people would recognize the song that they would get

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:13.300
sidetracked from what they're seeing and hearing in the story but in this case

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:18.379
it really seemed like the content of the song the message of the song would

00:08:18.379 --> 00:08:24.579
really fit very well and so in experimenting with the music we realized that

00:08:24.579 --> 00:08:29.180
even when you strip away the melody just use the chords which is what you hear

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:34.700
at the very beginning of the video and then at some point we actually depart

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:39.379
from that compositionally we do not stick strictly to the song throughout the

00:08:39.379 --> 00:08:45.460
music score but we borrow from it intermittently and that's because early on

00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:50.539
we're talking about the the disaster itself the tragedy itself so there are

00:08:50.539 --> 00:08:55.419
other musical needs so we depart from this from the song composition and we

00:08:55.419 --> 00:09:00.179
develop differently for a time but later when we're telling the part about our

00:09:00.179 --> 00:09:06.059
brothers and sisters surviving working together helping one another that's

00:09:06.059 --> 00:09:11.460
when we bring the song itself singers and all back into the story we have an

00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:16.659
excellent recording chorus in our Philippines branch we had them audition

00:09:16.659 --> 00:09:35.340
soloists for us from which we selected the female soloist that was used in this

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:39.379
case it turned out to be a really good fit taking this story to a higher level

00:09:39.379 --> 00:09:44.740
than just say humanitarian efforts it really gives gives the spiritual aspect of

00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:55.169
the the help and the provision from Johova himself you may recall that in the

00:09:55.169 --> 00:10:01.250
video there was a young girl Cheryl and her brother the two of them lost their

00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:06.409
parents and their other siblings during that terrible typhoon and we're

00:10:06.409 --> 00:10:11.529
happy to report that first of all very quickly after the typhoon a family in

00:10:11.529 --> 00:10:17.009
that area where the evacuees were they took the two into their family and

00:10:17.009 --> 00:10:22.370
cared for them until such time as another family became available that is

00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:27.090
closer to where the branch office is Cheryl joined the auxiliary pioneer

00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:31.529
service in May and her brother is making progress in studying the Bible the

00:10:31.529 --> 00:10:35.889
brothers have really rallied to help these children to go on with her lives and

00:10:35.889 --> 00:10:40.649
to continue serving Johova it was really important that this video be done

00:10:40.649 --> 00:10:46.169
because the brothers around the world needed to know what had happened to

00:10:46.169 --> 00:10:51.370
their brothers and sisters in the Philippines typhoon hyan hit landfall in a

00:10:51.370 --> 00:10:56.809
country in which we have over 185,000 of our brothers and sisters the impact was

00:10:56.809 --> 00:11:12.860
great on them their story had really needed to be told we are a worldwide

00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:17.100
organization we're a worldwide brotherhood of family we love each other we

00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:20.700
care for each other and we need to know when there's a need like this and what

00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:27.019
can be done to help whenever Johova's people demonstrate this kind of love in

00:11:27.019 --> 00:11:32.059
helping one another it really is Christianity in action this was a powerful

00:11:32.059 --> 00:11:36.740
story to tell we know we're living in the last days and tragedies like this

00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:41.980
happen many of us wonder how would I react if if that happened to me and seeing

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:46.460
the examples of faith of our brothers and sisters in the Philippines is so

00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:50.899
faith strengthening because we see that even if you lose everything Johova always

00:11:50.899 --> 00:12:00.970
takes care of us how amazing to see the effort our brothers put forth to help

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:07.690
one another and also to document those efforts so that we could all benefit our

00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:13.809
ministry is another kind of search and rescue operation and we search wherever

00:12:13.809 --> 00:12:20.289
people can be found for example in the following report notice the efforts

00:12:20.289 --> 00:12:29.940
our brothers made to reach people living in the remotest areas of Africa

00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:36.779
Jesus made the bold statement at X1 verse 8 you'll be witnesses of me to the most

00:12:36.779 --> 00:12:43.980
distant parts of the earth this resonates deeply in a country of Namibia this

00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:50.860
warm and beautiful people are spread across great expanses of dramatic and

00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:58.379
thirsty land the people are not only separated by physical distances they

00:12:58.379 --> 00:13:08.139
also separate by cultures ancient traditions and historic injustices since

00:13:08.139 --> 00:13:12.940
a South Africa branch offers overseas the work in this territory we are pleased

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:18.700
to assist a group of brothers from the capital city Vintuk with a special

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:25.019
witnessing trip so brothers our journey will start in Vintuk and we're going to

00:13:25.019 --> 00:13:30.059
travel to Humphurst from there we're going to go to Tumquay we're going to

00:13:30.059 --> 00:13:34.940
camp in those two places Hum and Tumquay and we may travel a distance of about

00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:42.500
1500 kilometers let's talk safety now you want to keep three creatures out of

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:49.620
your tent animals such as ahinas scorpions and snakes always the pure tent

00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:55.940
toilet facilities a method that Moses prescribes for the eastern lights

00:13:55.940 --> 00:14:01.539
when we enter the Herrera home enter through the side gate this is to show

00:14:01.539 --> 00:14:05.620
respect because they have areas in their homesteads that are restricted for

00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:09.860
ancestor worship also they don't like being asked direct questions it would be

00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:13.379
better to show them pictures and let them comment

00:14:13.379 --> 00:14:17.620
the theme scripture first Corinthians 9 verse 22

00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:23.299
said I've become all things to people of all sorts so that I might buy all

00:14:23.299 --> 00:14:28.659
possible means save some and that's really the purpose of our trip giving

00:14:28.659 --> 00:14:34.259
them our hope for the future brothers and sisters let's enjoy our trip

00:14:34.259 --> 00:14:53.840
into the caloric so we've been as a family involved with the Anasantility for

00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:58.879
about three years you know just a privilege to to bring the truth to these

00:14:58.879 --> 00:15:04.720
different cultures this is probably the only chance that they will have in

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:08.480
this distant part of the world to find the truth

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:13.200
when you talk to them about the truth you see how people enjoy listening

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:19.620
this is something that changes in their eyes enjoy that we get as a family

00:15:19.779 --> 00:15:24.980
from teaching people about about Jehovah's it's just incomparable really

00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:28.990
rejuvenates our ministry

00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:34.269
Arnold welcome to the meeting for field service we will see two demonstrations

00:15:34.269 --> 00:15:42.179
presenting the good news to a Herrera and a sandhouse you put that piece of

00:15:42.179 --> 00:15:47.139
literature in the person's hand and you feel a sort of peace

00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:53.539
my grandmother came into contact with the witnesses through an assigned

00:15:53.539 --> 00:15:58.100
territory she moved to the city to attend meetings

00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:04.659
and I went with her I learned the truth from her and later we were baptized

00:16:04.659 --> 00:16:09.700
I work in the translation office in Vintok and now I have a part in the

00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:13.539
translation of the literature for people who live in remote areas like

00:16:13.539 --> 00:16:16.100
these oh Shokopitiramobom we are shared to home

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:23.460
we live very far in the bush so I was happy when they came for the first time

00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:28.740
I even asked them who sent you to my place because this is the right place

00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:36.960
that you are visiting these books help me understand my Bible

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:42.639
really helps us also as a family is seeing Jehovah's creation like

00:16:42.639 --> 00:16:45.840
we've been campaigned at the Big Barber Tree

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:55.899
I'm sure it's thousands of years old

00:16:55.899 --> 00:16:59.419
really does show you exactly how Jehovah feels about every person in his

00:16:59.419 --> 00:17:03.500
organization I mean if he's willing to send in six vehicles

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:08.460
over 30 brothers just to find one person in one territory about 600

00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:13.180
ks away from any congregation then he must have great love for each

00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:19.329
person in the congregation when Jehovah looks at people or at

00:17:19.329 --> 00:17:25.809
countries he doesn't see groups or nationalities but he sees individuals

00:17:25.809 --> 00:17:30.049
and that's really his world that each individual human being

00:17:30.049 --> 00:17:34.690
gets to know him learn to love him and have a close relationship with him

00:18:13.819 --> 00:18:15.660
you know?

00:18:34.930 --> 00:18:37.730
Since I'm the only send speaking witness

00:18:37.730 --> 00:18:42.049
I will be thrilled to speak to the send people about God's word

00:18:42.049 --> 00:18:45.970
because I've seen how much joy the truth has brought me.

00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:49.890
The old lady we witnessed two years ago,

00:18:49.890 --> 00:18:53.170
I explained to her that she will also be young,

00:18:53.490 --> 00:18:55.450
with her fresh skin,

00:18:55.450 --> 00:18:59.170
and then she was very happy that she could be young again

00:18:59.170 --> 00:19:01.650
and Jehovah is going to make a paradise soon.

00:19:02.369 --> 00:19:05.609
It's really nice that we don't overlook the children.

00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:09.410
You could really see that even those ones that were sitting for her

00:19:09.569 --> 00:19:13.569
came closer and were seriously watching the Caleb videos,

00:19:13.569 --> 00:19:16.130
so it can really touch their little hearts.

00:19:17.170 --> 00:19:23.890
I am confident in Jehovah's word of saying that all the nations will hear the truth,

00:19:23.890 --> 00:19:29.009
even the sun people, even if they are the last ones to hear the truth, they will hear it.

00:19:33.539 --> 00:19:36.500
It's faith strengthening to see the effort

00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:41.940
that Jehovah's people make to search out those who are yet to be reached with the good news.

00:19:42.579 --> 00:19:46.339
And really, that's the work that all of us are doing

00:19:46.339 --> 00:19:50.819
as we continue searching for interested ones in our territory.

00:19:51.859 --> 00:19:55.700
But besides those who face natural disasters,

00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:58.660
and those who still need to be reached with the good news,

00:19:59.619 --> 00:20:02.579
could there be another group of people,

00:20:02.579 --> 00:20:06.579
even close to where we live that we need to search for?

00:20:08.019 --> 00:20:11.700
The governing body has asked me to speak to you for a few minutes

00:20:11.779 --> 00:20:15.940
on the theme, Jehovah cares for his sheep.

00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:19.619
Hebrews chapter 2 verse 1 says,

00:20:20.579 --> 00:20:26.980
It is necessary for us to pay more than the usual attention to the things we have heard,

00:20:27.619 --> 00:20:30.500
so that we never drift away.

00:20:32.099 --> 00:20:39.700
Sadly, some of Jehovah's people have drifted away to the extent that they no longer attend meetings

00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:46.019
or go out in the ministry. For one reason or another, they've become inactive.

00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:48.740
Is that your situation?

00:20:50.930 --> 00:20:56.930
If so, never forget the words of 1 Peter chapter 5 verse 7.

00:20:57.809 --> 00:21:02.930
There, the Bible tells us to throw all our anxiety on Jehovah,

00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:05.250
and then it adds the phrase,

00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:08.130
because he cares for you.

00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:10.930
Because he cares for you.

00:21:11.730 --> 00:21:13.329
What do those words imply?

00:21:14.609 --> 00:21:18.849
It's true that Peter was speaking to a group of Christians,

00:21:18.849 --> 00:21:22.369
so he used the plural word for you in that verse.

00:21:23.329 --> 00:21:28.210
But does that mean that Jehovah only cares for his people as a group?

00:21:29.329 --> 00:21:33.490
Or does he care for you and me as individuals?

00:21:34.450 --> 00:21:42.369
To be honest, our imperfect mind may fight the idea that Jehovah cares for us personally.

00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:48.130
From everything we've seen in this world, the more power someone has,

00:21:48.769 --> 00:21:51.650
the less he seems to care about individuals.

00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:56.609
For example, a politician might campaign for your vote,

00:21:57.250 --> 00:21:59.009
but he doesn't even know your name.

00:21:59.970 --> 00:22:03.569
It might be almost impossible for you to approach him.

00:22:04.690 --> 00:22:07.809
How different from our God, Jehovah.

00:22:08.609 --> 00:22:14.130
Jehovah cares for each individual who has entered into a relationship with him.

00:22:15.250 --> 00:22:16.210
How do we know that?

00:22:17.329 --> 00:22:21.809
Open your Bible to John chapter 6 and verse 44.

00:22:22.769 --> 00:22:29.569
Now here, Jesus made a profound statement about those who choose to serve Jehovah.

00:22:30.369 --> 00:22:34.049
At John 6 verse 44, Jesus said,

00:22:35.730 --> 00:22:41.730
no man can come to me unless the father who sent me draws him.

00:22:43.329 --> 00:22:45.890
Now, think about what those words imply.

00:22:47.170 --> 00:22:51.250
By means of the preaching work, which reaches us individually,

00:22:52.210 --> 00:22:56.930
and by means of his Holy Spirit, which helps us grasp the truth,

00:22:57.890 --> 00:23:04.450
Jehovah personally draws us toward his son and toward his organization.

00:23:05.569 --> 00:23:11.250
To draw someone, Jehovah must see something of value in that person,

00:23:11.970 --> 00:23:14.930
and that means he must care about that person.

00:23:16.210 --> 00:23:19.730
But what if for some reason you've drifted away from the congregation?

00:23:20.450 --> 00:23:23.089
Does that mean Jehovah has forgotten you?

00:23:23.970 --> 00:23:30.529
Not at all. Consider the love Jehovah showed for his people, the Israelites,

00:23:30.529 --> 00:23:36.289
even when they were separated from their homeland and taken captive by the Assyrians.

00:23:37.089 --> 00:23:41.009
Did Jehovah forget about them? Did he reject them?

00:23:41.650 --> 00:23:44.210
Would he ever welcome them back home?

00:23:45.170 --> 00:23:48.609
Once the Israelites were moved to change their course,

00:23:49.329 --> 00:23:51.009
Jehovah took notice.

00:23:51.970 --> 00:23:56.289
At Jeremiah chapter 31 and verse 18, he says,

00:23:57.250 --> 00:24:00.769
I have surely heard Ephraim's moaning.

00:24:01.890 --> 00:24:03.809
But what was Ephraim moaning?

00:24:04.769 --> 00:24:07.730
What were the people crying out to Jehovah?

00:24:08.529 --> 00:24:16.130
I will readily turn back for you are Jehovah my God,

00:24:17.089 --> 00:24:20.049
or as another translation renders those words,

00:24:21.089 --> 00:24:25.730
you are our God, please let us come home.

00:24:27.009 --> 00:24:35.730
When the Israelites called out to Jehovah for help, he heard, he cared, and he responded.

00:24:36.690 --> 00:24:39.569
Can Jehovah do the same for you?

00:24:40.609 --> 00:24:44.849
Yes, in fact, he is already searching for you.

00:24:45.809 --> 00:24:51.170
Open your Bible to Ezekiel chapter 34 and verse 16.

00:24:52.450 --> 00:25:00.210
Now, as we read this verse, notice four things that Jehovah does for his precious sheep

00:25:00.289 --> 00:25:06.049
who have been lost. At Ezekiel 34 and verse 16, Jehovah says,

00:25:07.650 --> 00:25:17.890
the lost one I will search for, the stray I will bring back, the injured I will bandage,

00:25:18.529 --> 00:25:21.250
and the weak I will strengthen.

00:25:22.930 --> 00:25:27.809
Did you notice four things that Jehovah does for those who have been lost?

00:25:28.690 --> 00:25:31.569
First, he searches for them.

00:25:32.769 --> 00:25:35.730
Once they're found, he brings them back.

00:25:36.849 --> 00:25:43.250
Then, he bandages their wounds, and finally, he strengthens them.

00:25:44.769 --> 00:25:52.769
If you are inactive, do Jehovah's words at Ezekiel 34, 16 touch your heart?

00:25:53.730 --> 00:26:01.809
Perhaps you feel similar to the writer of Psalm 119, who begged Jehovah in verse 176.

00:26:03.009 --> 00:26:12.369
I have strayed like a lost sheep. Search for your servant, for I have not forgotten your commandments.

00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:20.049
The fact that you are watching this broadcast is evidence that you haven't forgotten Jehovah,

00:26:20.769 --> 00:26:28.609
and he hasn't forgotten you. In fact, it could be that by means of this program,

00:26:29.329 --> 00:26:37.329
Jehovah is searching for you. The question isn't, why are you inactive or how long have you been

00:26:37.329 --> 00:26:47.170
inactive? The real question is, are you ready to come home? Admittedly, it will take effort to return.

00:26:48.130 --> 00:26:54.769
But what will happen when you put forth that effort? James chapter 4 verse 8 says,

00:26:55.329 --> 00:27:04.769
that when you draw close to Jehovah, he draws close to you. That means he still cares for you as an

00:27:04.769 --> 00:27:15.569
individual, but it's urgent that you act without delay. Why? Open your Bible to Luke chapter 21,

00:27:15.650 --> 00:27:25.250
and verses 34 to 36. The clear warning that Jesus gave should be food for thought for every

00:27:25.250 --> 00:27:33.490
one of Jehovah's precious sheep. At Luke chapter 21 verses 34 and 35, Jesus said,

00:27:35.250 --> 00:27:42.930
pay attention to yourselves, that your hearts never become weighed down with overeating and heavy

00:27:42.930 --> 00:27:51.490
drinking and anxieties of life, and suddenly that day be instantly upon you as a snare.

00:27:52.369 --> 00:28:00.849
For it will come upon all those dwelling on the face of the whole earth. Now notice the call to

00:28:00.849 --> 00:28:10.849
action in verse 36. Keep awake then, all the time making supplication that you may succeed in

00:28:10.849 --> 00:28:17.329
escaping all these things that must occur and in standing before the Son of Man.

00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:27.809
The message in these verses is clear. The nearness of the end makes it urgent that we pay

00:28:27.809 --> 00:28:37.490
attention to ourselves. The August 15th 2015 watchtower offered some thought provoking comments on

00:28:37.490 --> 00:28:46.130
this matter. It stated, how bad do you expect conditions to become before the Great Tribulation?

00:28:47.170 --> 00:28:54.690
For example, do you expect that there will be a war in every country? No food on anyone's table

00:28:55.410 --> 00:29:03.009
and illness in every household? Under those conditions, even skeptics would feel compelled to

00:29:03.009 --> 00:29:11.089
admit the Bible prophecy was undergoing fulfillment. However, Jesus said that most people would take

00:29:11.089 --> 00:29:18.690
no note of His presence, carrying on with life's normal activities until it is too late.

00:29:19.730 --> 00:29:26.529
Thus, the Scriptures indicate that world conditions during the last days would not become so

00:29:26.529 --> 00:29:31.809
extreme that people would be forced to believe that the end is near.

00:29:33.009 --> 00:29:45.200
Well then, the article said this, we should not assume that much time is needed for the state

00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:52.400
of this world to develop to the point where the ten horns and the wild beast of Revelation chapter

00:29:52.400 --> 00:30:01.440
17 verse 16 turn on Babylon the Great, the world empire of false religion. Let us bear in mind

00:30:02.079 --> 00:30:09.200
that God will put it into their hearts to make that move and this could happen swiftly

00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:19.730
and at any time the end of this entire system of things is not far off. Brothers and sisters,

00:30:20.450 --> 00:30:29.569
do you sense the urgency in those words? It may be that until now you thought that some world

00:30:29.569 --> 00:30:37.250
event would make it clear that you need to return to Jehovah but the Bible tells us that the

00:30:37.250 --> 00:30:44.849
Great Tribulation will break out with such suddenness that it will catch people unaware, leaving

00:30:44.849 --> 00:30:54.849
no time to make changes. Really then, if you have been inactive and waiting for the right time to

00:30:54.849 --> 00:31:05.410
return, this is it and you can be sure that Jehovah will welcome you back home. He views each

00:31:05.410 --> 00:31:14.369
sheep as a valuable part of his congregation. In fact, notice what Jehovah says about his people

00:31:14.369 --> 00:31:24.130
at Malachi chapter 3 and verse 17. Now, as we read the words in this verse, think about the

00:31:24.210 --> 00:31:32.130
value that Jehovah places on each individual in his organization, including those who may have

00:31:32.130 --> 00:31:40.930
drifted. At Malachi chapter 3 and verse 17, Jehovah says about his people, they will be

00:31:40.930 --> 00:31:49.170
mine, says Jehovah of armies, in the day when I produce a special property. The footnote in the

00:31:49.170 --> 00:31:57.009
New World translation gives an alternate rendering for special property as treasured possession.

00:31:57.970 --> 00:32:05.490
Imagine, in Jehovah's eyes, even if you have drifted from the flock, you have not been discarded

00:32:06.130 --> 00:32:17.329
and why? Because you are still precious to Jehovah. They are mine, he says, and he views you as special

00:32:17.329 --> 00:32:26.130
property as a treasured possession. That means if you're lost, Jehovah wants you to be found.

00:32:27.009 --> 00:32:36.130
If you're hurt, he wants you to be healed. And we do too. After all, you are our fathers and

00:32:36.130 --> 00:32:45.009
mothers, sons and daughters, brothers and sisters. We long for the day that you will be reunited

00:32:45.890 --> 00:32:55.730
so that we can serve Jehovah together once again. The message then is clear. This is the time.

00:32:56.690 --> 00:33:05.170
There is no better place to be than in the protective arms of Jehovah. He is searching for you

00:33:05.250 --> 00:33:17.859
and inviting you to come back home. Please, act now without delay. But how can you find the strength

00:33:17.859 --> 00:33:26.819
to return? You'll enjoy the true life experience of Jade Long, a sister who was raised in the truth,

00:33:26.819 --> 00:33:34.259
but slowly drifted during her teenage years. How was she helped to find her way back home?

00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:49.740
As a high school senior, I started to grow friendlier with those that I went to school with,

00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:53.819
as well as those that I worked with, and started to lead a double life.

00:33:55.019 --> 00:34:01.579
As time went by, what I thought wouldn't affect me began to affect me, and my relationship with

00:34:01.579 --> 00:34:08.780
Jehovah wasn't as strong as it once was, and I was drifting away from the organization.

00:34:09.739 --> 00:34:16.539
Within a matter of months, I realized I wanted to leave home. I decided to relocate to Oregon,

00:34:17.099 --> 00:34:24.300
and this would mean supporting myself and doing things by myself for myself. My relationship with

00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:31.019
Jehovah had already weakened to the point where I started an emotional relationship with a man

00:34:31.019 --> 00:34:37.659
who was not a witness. Although it was emotional and not physical, it was a very serious relationship for me.

00:34:39.099 --> 00:34:45.659
Where we got very close, very fast, and soon I realized that his standards did not match up

00:34:45.659 --> 00:34:51.179
with the standards set forth in the Bible. This was a time where I really had to sit down and decide

00:34:51.179 --> 00:34:56.940
what I wanted to do to either pursue a relationship with this man or Jehovah.

00:34:57.739 --> 00:35:03.340
I still believed in the truth that Jehovah had set out, so I chose Jehovah.

00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:10.219
I realized shortly after my break-off that I could not continue in my ways.

00:35:11.099 --> 00:35:19.739
I became very anxious. I also was very emotionally distraught, and this took me away from the meetings.

00:35:20.380 --> 00:35:27.099
When I tried to go back to meetings, not only did I feel guilt and anxiety of what people might

00:35:27.179 --> 00:35:34.139
do or react to me coming into the Kingdom Hall, but also just getting motivated to go prove to be

00:35:34.139 --> 00:35:39.500
a challenge. There were times when I would shower, and I couldn't make it any farther along in my

00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:45.500
daily routine. There were times when I made it into my car, but I couldn't get the will to drive

00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:50.460
to the Kingdom Hall, and there were times when I made it to the Kingdom Hall, but I couldn't open

00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:57.579
the front door of the Kingdom Hall. So what started as a couple of months being away from meetings

00:35:57.579 --> 00:36:03.179
soon turned into six months, which soon turned into a year, and then two years.

00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:11.739
I felt so distant from the congregation and from Jehovah. I realized it would take a big change

00:36:11.739 --> 00:36:19.980
for me to get back to the meetings and back to Jehovah. Not too long after this, I got to relocate

00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:28.050
the East Coast with a job opportunity, and I saw this as a fresh start, and it happened to be also

00:36:28.050 --> 00:36:34.050
around the same time as the memorial, and I was surprised to find the letter in my mail from an elder

00:36:34.050 --> 00:36:42.610
in the local territory that had invited me. When it became night for the memorial, I was still anxious,

00:36:42.610 --> 00:36:47.570
knowing that I hadn't been to meetings outside of the memorial for over two and a half years.

00:36:48.369 --> 00:36:54.530
These were people that I had never met before, but I realized the importance of the memorial,

00:36:54.530 --> 00:37:00.530
and it was time for me to make my stand and show I had taken my stand. So I went to the memorial.

00:37:01.250 --> 00:37:08.130
There I was welcomed by many people that were friendly, eager to meet me, and really encouraging

00:37:08.130 --> 00:37:14.690
for me to keep coming to the meetings. In time, I was attending all the meetings on a regular basis,

00:37:14.690 --> 00:37:20.849
and the elders approached me wanting to know if I wanted a Bible study. I had been raised in

00:37:20.849 --> 00:37:27.809
the truth and thought I don't need a Bible study. However, I also knew that they would keep asking,

00:37:27.809 --> 00:37:33.809
and so when they came the second time and asked, I realized, maybe I can't do it on my own.

00:37:33.809 --> 00:37:38.610
So I gladly accepted a Bible study with a sister in the congregation, and I'm so glad I did.

00:37:39.090 --> 00:37:46.769
She proved to be a listening ear. I have supported myself for so long. I realized that in life you

00:37:46.769 --> 00:37:52.929
can't just rely on yourself. You need help, and she helped me see that Jehovah's always there to

00:37:52.929 --> 00:37:59.969
provide help, as well as those in the congregation. Specifically, she showed me a watchtower article

00:37:59.969 --> 00:38:07.650
regarding Psalm 23 that Jehovah is our shepherd, that he cares for us. He wants to look out and

00:38:07.650 --> 00:38:14.769
protect us, be there to help us when we go through hard times. I also had the opportunity to

00:38:14.769 --> 00:38:20.690
have a Bible study with the circuit overseer when he was visiting our congregation. He was really

00:38:20.690 --> 00:38:26.449
encouraging, and he helped me appreciate that from my background, I could look to others in the

00:38:26.449 --> 00:38:32.130
congregation and help them, either when I see them going down a wrong path, or when they're

00:38:32.610 --> 00:38:38.210
returning to the congregation and offering encouragement to them. I'm thankful that I came back to

00:38:38.210 --> 00:38:44.530
the congregation, because now more than ever, I feel Jehovah is real and very interested in me.

00:38:44.530 --> 00:38:50.449
I've also received many blessings from coming back to Jehovah in his congregation. I found a loving

00:38:50.449 --> 00:38:55.969
husband who I've been able to work with on construction projects at Kingdom Halls and Assembly

00:38:56.849 --> 00:39:02.050
Halls. I've had an increased share in the ministry, even at times pioneering, and recently I've

00:39:02.050 --> 00:39:09.710
been able to commute to Bethel as a part-time commuter. I am determined to stay close to Jehovah

00:39:09.710 --> 00:39:15.789
and his organization, so that way I can help others in the brotherhood going forward, whether it's

00:39:15.789 --> 00:39:21.949
on a one-on-one basis, or as time of need such as a natural disaster. I want to make sure I can do

00:39:22.190 --> 00:39:32.400
all I can to help others. How encouraging that Sister Long found her way home to Jehovah's

00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:39.280
organization and how reassuring this can be to others who were raised in the truth, but may also

00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:47.519
have drifted away. You too can return to Jehovah. We encourage you to reach out for help,

00:39:47.519 --> 00:39:54.480
or to respond to the help that's been offered to you. But what if it's been many years since you

00:39:54.480 --> 00:40:01.920
served Jehovah? Does Jehovah still care for you? The following interview will help you answer

00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:09.920
that question. It's the story of Manfred Stephensdorfer, a brother in Germany who was separated from

00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:17.599
Jehovah's organization for many years. How did Jehovah show his personal care for brother

00:40:17.679 --> 00:40:28.719
Stephensdorfer and how did he respond? One day early in the morning, I had a kind of heart attack

00:40:35.309 --> 00:40:49.250
and because it didn't stop, I went to the hospital. When I arrived there, then the heart calmed down.

00:40:52.000 --> 00:41:00.480
So I sat there in the car and started to think about my life. I was not really happy.

00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:10.269
There was an emptiness in my heart. I was racing the truth. My parents got baptized when I was

00:41:10.269 --> 00:41:17.389
two and my brother five years old. But eight years later, when I was ten, they became inactive.

00:41:19.389 --> 00:41:24.750
For almost one year, I went alone to the meetings. A young brother and his wife,

00:41:25.469 --> 00:41:31.630
they really took care of me. He took me along in field service. He gave me little assignments,

00:41:31.630 --> 00:41:37.789
let me read at the book study which impressed me a lot and also participated in the Theorocratic

00:41:37.789 --> 00:41:44.110
Ministry school. But then a few months later, we moved to another town far away from any kingdom

00:41:44.110 --> 00:41:50.269
hall. So I didn't have any chance to attend the meetings anymore. For the next ten years,

00:41:50.269 --> 00:41:58.349
because of school and sports, and later also because of my demanding work, I was so busy that I

00:41:58.349 --> 00:42:07.630
was completely distracted from the truth. But deep in my heart, I knew there is Jehovah and there is

00:42:07.630 --> 00:42:16.670
the truth. And my conscience reminded me from time to time. But nothing happened until that very

00:42:16.670 --> 00:42:27.679
morning when I sat in the car and started to think about my life. I started to pray the very first

00:42:27.679 --> 00:42:34.400
time after many years, the long prayer and I poured out all my feelings to Jehovah and I asked

00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:43.809
him to help me to return. Because I knew it would not be that easy. Well, a few days later,

00:42:43.809 --> 00:42:51.570
while I was waiting for somebody, a girl sat beside me and I'd asked her right away whether she

00:42:51.570 --> 00:42:59.170
believes in God. A very interesting discussion started and she said that she was a strong Catholic,

00:42:59.489 --> 00:43:06.050
and she was also searching for the truth because she was not happy with what happened in her religion.

00:43:06.050 --> 00:43:14.210
We continued our conversations, we decided to examine both together religion and to start with

00:43:14.210 --> 00:43:19.650
Jehovah's Witnesses. A few weeks later, we looked in a newspaper for an address of a kingdom hall

00:43:20.530 --> 00:43:26.690
and we went there, but we had to leave earlier because of my health condition so there was no

00:43:26.690 --> 00:43:33.090
contact to the congregation to any of these brothers. In the meantime, we got married and not long

00:43:33.090 --> 00:43:39.570
after we got married, the sister came to our door from house to house. I wasn't at all my wife

00:43:39.570 --> 00:43:44.690
took the truth book and asked her whether she would be willing to return the next day because then

00:43:44.690 --> 00:43:51.809
I would be home. When I came back in the evening, I was so happy when I heard what had happened.

00:43:51.889 --> 00:43:58.929
So I took the truth book, studied to read, and I didn't end until the book was finished.

00:44:01.099 --> 00:44:09.090
And everything that I've learned as a child came back. The next day, the sister came, we studied

00:44:09.090 --> 00:44:16.210
the Bible study. At the weekend, we attended a circuit assembly and the week after we attended a

00:44:16.210 --> 00:44:24.530
meeting. The brothers were so friendly and welcomed us in such a way that I really felt

00:44:24.610 --> 00:44:32.849
as if I had returned home. So we were so enthused that the right way went to my parents.

00:44:33.650 --> 00:44:39.090
We right away went to my brother at the same time, so he was married in the meantime. He had a child

00:44:39.969 --> 00:44:45.889
and I studied a Bible study with him. I also went to an uncle of mine and I heard that he also

00:44:45.889 --> 00:44:52.449
was a witness in the 1950s. So we invited Tim to accompany us to the convention in Nuremberg.

00:44:53.090 --> 00:44:57.650
He agreed, we took him along and we came then there at the assembly ground.

00:44:58.210 --> 00:45:04.690
And then I also went to the brother who cared for me when I was a child because I heard that he

00:45:04.690 --> 00:45:12.530
also was inactive. So we told them what has happened to us and how much he influenced my life

00:45:12.530 --> 00:45:19.250
when he cared for me as a child. And you can imagine what joy we had when they all returned to

00:45:19.250 --> 00:45:27.570
Jehovah. At the same time, I decided together with my wife not to say no to Jehovah, to say yes

00:45:27.570 --> 00:45:34.210
whenever it would be possible. We became also very active in field service. So in the month when I

00:45:34.210 --> 00:45:40.929
was baptized, I owe zero pioneers. Eight months after baptism, I started regular pioneering.

00:45:40.929 --> 00:45:47.889
My wife started also some time later. When we were asked to special pioneer, we said yes.

00:45:47.969 --> 00:45:53.250
When we were asked to assist with engineering construction here at this new construction in

00:45:53.250 --> 00:45:59.889
Zeltas, we also agreed. We said yes to it. Some years later, when we were asked to stay at

00:45:59.889 --> 00:46:07.010
Bethel as Bethelites, we also agreed to it. We also said yes. Because of all the blessings we

00:46:07.010 --> 00:46:13.329
experienced from the very beginning, we got the strength and we got the joy to put in practice

00:46:13.329 --> 00:46:19.570
what we were determined to do. So that means it was an outstanding joy as you can imagine

00:46:20.369 --> 00:46:27.570
when all those relatives came back to the truth and returned to Jehovah. It was a joy that many

00:46:27.570 --> 00:46:33.809
of the studies we had in all these years, they finally, many of them, they got baptized.

00:46:38.719 --> 00:46:46.239
But one of the outstanding blessings was that I got to know my wife. She really helped me a lot

00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:53.760
to return to Jehovah and she always gave a wonderful example and was very jealous in field service

00:46:53.760 --> 00:47:14.380
up to this day. I personally experienced how merciful Jehovah was to me and to my wife

00:47:14.380 --> 00:47:25.340
that he is really full of tender affection. When I returned to him, then he returned to me

00:47:26.219 --> 00:47:40.429
in a faith strengthening way. What a blessing brother Stephensdorfer had not only to be

00:47:40.429 --> 00:47:48.110
reactivated himself, but to reactivate others. Brother Stephensdorfer kept his word about

00:47:48.110 --> 00:47:55.949
always saying yes to Jehovah. In fact, he now serves as a member of the branch committee in central

00:47:56.670 --> 00:48:03.630
Europe. Of course, no matter what privileges we enjoy in Jehovah's organization, no one is

00:48:03.630 --> 00:48:11.469
immune to Satan's attacks. That's one reason why the Apostle Paul wrote at 1 Corinthians chapter 10

00:48:11.469 --> 00:48:21.309
verse 12, let the one who thinks he is standing beware that he does not fall. Penny Greene is a

00:48:21.309 --> 00:48:28.989
sister who experienced the reality of those words, but she also experienced Jehovah's loving

00:48:28.989 --> 00:48:43.699
care. This is her story. I was raised as one of Jehovah's witnesses by two witness parents.

00:48:45.460 --> 00:48:53.539
They always encouraged full-time service for all four of us children and each of us did enter

00:48:53.539 --> 00:49:04.480
the full-time service. For me, that was at 17 and that I started regular pioneering. At 19 years

00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:10.960
old, I was invited by the branch to become a special pioneer, but was really quite a privilege.

00:49:18.829 --> 00:49:27.469
No matter who you are, no matter what privileges of service you have, Paul knew what he was talking

00:49:27.469 --> 00:49:44.219
about when he said, beware because you can fall. I was visited by an old friend who had developed a

00:49:44.219 --> 00:49:53.179
critical complaining spirit. Instead of putting those thoughts out of my mind, I let it grow,

00:49:54.059 --> 00:50:05.099
and it created a downward spiral in my spirituality. And then before I knew it, I was completely

00:50:05.099 --> 00:50:18.909
inactive. I wasn't happy because I didn't fit in anywhere. I wasn't completely in the world,

00:50:18.909 --> 00:50:26.909
but I'd cut myself off from Jehovah's organization. I met someone, he was also raised as one of

00:50:26.909 --> 00:50:38.210
Jehovah's witnesses, so while we were both inactive, we were married. My family was so loving and

00:50:38.210 --> 00:50:47.650
patient with me. They didn't try to force me through conversation or in any other way to come

00:50:47.650 --> 00:50:53.329
back to Jehovah. They were always there if I needed them and I knew that.

00:50:53.969 --> 00:51:01.250
I got a phone call from my mom saying that the district convention was going to be held in

00:51:01.250 --> 00:51:10.769
Jacksonville that summer. She at the time lived in Atlanta, and she asked me if she came to Jacksonville

00:51:10.769 --> 00:51:18.289
to go to the convention, would I get with her? It's about a six and a half hour drive between

00:51:18.449 --> 00:51:32.500
Atlanta and Jacksonville. So that's okay. I agreed just to make my mom happy. No big deal, I can do this.

00:51:33.940 --> 00:51:40.260
When you arrived, my son Chase was with me, and we're walking, and I'm thinking, I don't really

00:51:40.260 --> 00:51:47.219
want to be here, and I don't really think I can see myself ever associating with Jehovah's

00:51:47.219 --> 00:51:56.139
witnesses again. My son needed to be occupied, so a lot of my time was spent on him.

00:51:57.099 --> 00:52:02.139
That was an easy way out for me to not have to pay full attention to the program,

00:52:02.860 --> 00:52:11.260
but at the same time, part of me must have been listening. It was a demonstration. The publisher

00:52:12.139 --> 00:52:17.739
made a simple statement. She said, have you ever wondered what the earth would be like?

00:52:18.699 --> 00:52:26.300
If that kingdom that we pray for really came, and it was like someone flipped a switch,

00:52:27.019 --> 00:52:38.610
I felt a change in my heart. At that point, I knew that nothing else mattered. Anything that I

00:52:38.610 --> 00:52:45.730
had been critical of before didn't matter, because the kingdom was really going to come, and it

00:52:45.730 --> 00:52:52.289
was really going to make the earth a paradise. The following week, I attended a meeting.

00:52:53.570 --> 00:53:02.289
Amazingly, after being away for seven years, it felt very comfortable. It really did feel like going

00:53:02.289 --> 00:53:13.730
home. My family and friends just encouraged me. They never made me feel ostracized. They never

00:53:13.730 --> 00:53:22.130
made me feel guilty. It was almost like picking up where I left off and moving forward,

00:53:22.929 --> 00:53:27.250
and that's how they wanted me to feel. I think it's how Jehovah wants us to feel.

00:53:28.769 --> 00:53:37.250
My life now, I'm able to pioneer again. My husband, now we serve Jehovah together.

00:53:37.250 --> 00:53:47.599
We absolutely love being in the Hindi group. My children, they both start pioneering at young ages.

00:53:48.239 --> 00:53:54.480
My son, he is a belt-aligned at warwick, and my daughter, she and her husband served in the

00:53:54.480 --> 00:54:01.920
Dominican Republic. My mom is a regular pioneer. She's 94 years old. She continues to be an

00:54:01.920 --> 00:54:16.130
outstanding example for all of us. My life now is truly happy, and it's all because of Jehovah.

00:54:16.130 --> 00:54:20.929
Brother and sister Greene still live in the state of Florida in the United States,

00:54:20.929 --> 00:54:28.769
and Brother Greene serves as an elder in their local congregation. As you know, Jesus often

00:54:28.769 --> 00:54:35.809
compared his disciples to sheep. According to one Bible commentator, many flocks in Jesus'

00:54:35.809 --> 00:54:44.929
day were communal flocks, belonging not to individuals, but to villages. That commentary states

00:54:44.929 --> 00:54:52.289
that when a sheep was lost, the whole village would be on the watch. It's similar with sheep

00:54:52.449 --> 00:54:58.690
who have drifted away from the congregation. Really, they're a part of a community,

00:54:58.690 --> 00:55:05.969
a congregation, and that means all of us have an interest in their return. In fact,

00:55:06.690 --> 00:55:13.489
all of us can reach out to help these precious sheep. Let's consider how we can do that.

00:55:16.480 --> 00:55:24.159
My name is Abby. These are my friends and family. This is me in Laura. Laura's my sister.

00:55:24.719 --> 00:55:28.079
But up until a few months ago, I didn't even know who she was.

00:55:34.909 --> 00:55:41.469
It all began when I got lost going home in the subway. A woman was nice enough to help me out.

00:55:42.750 --> 00:55:53.760
Her name was Laura. She offered me a map, and I offered her a tract. But it turned out that she

00:55:53.760 --> 00:56:05.730
was a witness, and I was surprised to find out that she lived near my apartment. It made me wonder,

00:56:06.690 --> 00:56:18.260
I had never seen her at her congregation. Not long after that, the clerks had me over for supper.

00:56:18.260 --> 00:56:21.860
They're awesome cooks, and Brother Clark is an elder in my hall.

00:56:23.699 --> 00:56:29.539
I mentioned what happened to me on the subway, and he knew Laura right away. He explained that she

00:56:29.539 --> 00:56:35.380
was in our congregation, but had been feeling down for quite a while. She had become inactive,

00:56:35.380 --> 00:56:39.940
and even though the brothers had been visiting her and doing their best to help,

00:56:39.940 --> 00:56:45.460
she just seemed to be stuck. So I asked if it would be okay for me to visit her.

00:56:46.019 --> 00:56:54.500
Brother Clark thought it was a great idea. I was going to help Laura. I knew we'd be best friends

00:56:54.500 --> 00:57:04.750
in no time, but we weren't. I was able to talk to her, but it wasn't a good time,

00:57:05.710 --> 00:57:15.010
and it didn't go well at all. I felt so silly afterwards. All I could think was,

00:57:15.010 --> 00:57:21.409
who am I to jump in and try to fix things? I have no idea what I'm doing. I should have just

00:57:21.409 --> 00:57:26.929
left it to the elders. If they hadn't been able to help her, what chance did I have?

00:57:29.519 --> 00:57:34.960
The next time I saw Brother Clark, I explained what happened, told him how I felt,

00:57:34.960 --> 00:57:41.920
and just kept apologizing for everything. But he was an angry, or disappointed, or anything.

00:57:42.480 --> 00:57:48.800
Instead, he commended me for taking an interest in Laura. He told me that the elders weren't going

00:57:48.800 --> 00:57:54.880
to give up on her, and that I should have either. Then he showed me Jesus' illustration in Luke

00:57:54.880 --> 00:58:02.719
15 verse 8. Talking about those who strayed from the flock, Jesus said, or what woman who has

00:58:02.719 --> 00:58:09.519
10 Drakmakoins, if she loses one of the Drakmas, does not light a lamp, and sweep her house,

00:58:09.519 --> 00:58:19.730
and search carefully until she finds it. He told me that the obligation to help a week Christian

00:58:19.730 --> 00:58:24.769
was not beyond my abilities, but that I had to be persistent and keep searching.

00:58:26.530 --> 00:58:46.139
I realized that this wasn't just a coin, or an heirloom. I had lost my sister, and I didn't even

00:58:46.139 --> 00:58:54.699
know it. I knew that I had to do whatever I could to help. But this time, I wanted to do it right.

00:58:55.980 --> 00:59:15.699
So I did research, and I prayed, and I prepared. At first, I just tried to make up for how things

00:59:15.699 --> 00:59:32.619
had gone last time. She still didn't open up much, but it was a start. I kept coming, and so did

00:59:32.619 --> 01:00:44.739
the elders. It took time, and it took effort. But we started to get to know each other better,

01:00:52.769 --> 01:01:02.670
and she started to share more with me. Sometimes, out of discouragement or depression,

01:01:03.230 --> 01:01:11.230
she could say things she really didn't mean, wild talk. But I just tried to be a good listener.

01:01:11.710 --> 01:01:33.820
One time, I gave her a big hug and told her, I love you so much. And in the end, I discovered something

01:01:33.820 --> 01:01:42.780
very precious, that our brothers and sisters can become lost and need our help. And we don't need to

01:01:42.780 --> 01:01:55.420
be elders, just to listen, and to love. I found Laura, my lost sister, and my new friend.

01:02:29.230 --> 01:02:36.750
Or if you are currently inactive, imagine the joy you can have at being back home where you belong.

01:02:37.789 --> 01:02:45.710
Why not take that first small step, perhaps by calling an elder, or a mature friend in the congregation

01:02:45.710 --> 01:02:51.230
to reach out for help, or even by going to the kingdom hall and attending a meeting?

01:02:52.190 --> 01:02:59.550
A well-known proverb says that a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.

01:03:00.670 --> 01:03:06.829
We urge you to take that first step without delay, and never forget this.

01:03:07.949 --> 01:03:13.469
Jehovah can give you the strength you need to help you become reactivated.

01:03:14.349 --> 01:03:22.590
In fact, second Corinthians 4 verse 7 says, he can even give you power beyond what is normal.

01:03:23.550 --> 01:03:32.510
Time and time again, Jehovah has proved that no obstacle is too great for his spirit to overcome.

01:03:33.469 --> 01:03:41.389
To illustrate that point, you will enjoy the following interview that was recorded 15 years ago,

01:03:41.469 --> 01:03:49.469
with Nancy Yun, a faithful sister who spent two decades in prisons and labor camps in China.

01:03:50.349 --> 01:03:57.550
During her detention, sister Yun was separated from her family and put under constant pressure to

01:03:57.550 --> 01:04:10.480
renounce her faith. He turned to a communism. A period of time I was really very progressive.

01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:20.880
I almost joined the guerrillas, but my mother started me, and then I was married in 1945,

01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:28.000
just raised my children. So, before I got to, actually, I was half Protestant, half Communist.

01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:37.039
And then, one day, when I had two children already, steady Jones' first Jehovah's Witness came to visit me.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:45.679
After I was arrested and separated from my family, and my husband went to Hong Kong for his business

01:04:45.679 --> 01:04:52.880
1953. So, my four children were very young, ten, seven, four, two, fourteen and three.

01:04:52.880 --> 01:05:00.800
My mother, she took care of my children when I was arrested. And I had such a little housewife

01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:07.840
very easy to overtake me. So, he appeared very loving, and he said, do you know why we arrest you?

01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:16.079
Just because we love you, we wish to save you. Do you know you are deceived by these two impurities?

01:05:16.079 --> 01:05:22.320
Means, tenetons and hurricane. That's why today you became a criminal, separated from your family.

01:05:23.119 --> 01:05:29.840
But we know you are innocent. So, if you admit you were deceived, never mind, we can forgive you,

01:05:30.079 --> 01:05:36.960
can this do you? Even let you go to Hong Kong, reunite with your husband. What a temptation,

01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:43.519
because I've applied seven times to go to Hong Kong, but they did not permit me. But I knew clearly,

01:05:43.519 --> 01:05:48.800
if I say, oh yes, I was deceived. And next step, you have to betray your God and

01:05:48.800 --> 01:05:57.699
betray your brothers. How could I do that? So, the strong man came in the hand,

01:05:57.699 --> 01:06:04.179
kept me at a back. And I couldn't sleep in night. So, I tried, because I learned dance when I

01:06:04.179 --> 01:06:10.900
went to the doger. My body is solved. I tried to move over the hand cap into a friend of me.

01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:17.460
I could sleep there. So, seven days passed, I was still so happy. So, that night, the man,

01:06:17.460 --> 01:06:25.059
they came open the door, stand up. They found my hand, get a friend of me. I thought I was

01:06:25.460 --> 01:06:31.940
wrong. So, before I demonstrate and put my hand back, they were angry with me. So, they moved that

01:06:31.940 --> 01:06:40.739
to my app. Or then I'd really could and sleep, swallow, and I pray to Jehovah, you know, I'm

01:06:40.739 --> 01:06:48.099
willing to die for your name's sake. If you're aware, I have to be paralyzed. I'm willing, but

01:06:48.099 --> 01:06:55.539
tell me your will. And Jehovah showed me Roman 131 and 2. No authority is not from Jehovah.

01:06:55.539 --> 01:07:02.420
So, I have to show submissive, the relative day of the authority appell. So, 10 days later,

01:07:02.420 --> 01:07:08.820
I see here, here, seven days, here, three days, I say, my attitude was wrong. That's why they talk

01:07:09.780 --> 01:07:18.179
already. It's a very strong, almost paralyzed. You can see my scarcity here, after 42 years, both

01:07:18.179 --> 01:07:29.460
side. That's why I was handcuffed. I'm not a superhuman, even though my spirit was wrong,

01:07:29.460 --> 01:07:37.139
but my flesh is weak. I cry a lot, and I prayed, and Jehovah gave me scriptures,

01:07:37.139 --> 01:07:44.420
like first people, five, six, and seven. Help me a lot, see? Humber yourself, and then the

01:07:44.420 --> 01:07:52.659
mighty hand of God, in due time here, exalt you through all your anxiety. Upon God, He cares for

01:07:52.659 --> 01:08:03.679
you. All those scripture really comforted me. And I had freedom. Continue when I saw from

01:08:04.159 --> 01:08:13.360
70 to 74, I went as to more than 100 people from nine provinces, and resorted my second arrest.

01:08:14.480 --> 01:08:24.720
So, He pushed me to a very large room, full of four soldiers and policemen, and only arrested one

01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:32.159
person. It's me. So, this high officer left side of me, he announced discriminatory

01:08:32.159 --> 01:08:40.319
belongs to Aspire Agency, and of American impurities, named Jehovah's Witnesses.

01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:47.840
I was so happy, because I'm nothing, because of my death. Jehovah's name will be known

01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:55.119
to the city, because they never heard of Jehovah's name. So, I was happy. I was sentenced to 10

01:08:55.680 --> 01:09:06.689
years, because they said, she's the most stubborn person in our country. When I read Hebrew 11,

01:09:06.689 --> 01:09:14.210
about the ancient faithful servants of God, how they suffered, tortured. I thought, oh, it's only

01:09:14.210 --> 01:09:20.130
belonged to the ancient time. How can we endure like that? But it happened to modern time,

01:09:20.130 --> 01:09:27.890
and it happened to us, to me. I felt as a privilege Jehovah put the modern witness at the same,

01:09:28.449 --> 01:09:36.050
a position as the ancient faithful witnesses. I felt so privileged to do that. So, modern witnesses

01:09:36.050 --> 01:09:47.439
in Germany, they became my good examples. I said, I want to follow them. Now, I was waiting for them

01:09:47.439 --> 01:09:56.720
to sentence me to death, but nothing happened. It came to 1978, November 1st morning,

01:09:56.720 --> 01:10:03.680
and the guy came, and let me go follow him to the office, ask me to sign my name,

01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:13.439
say you are released. And on 27th of January, my husband talked me to Hong Kong, and reunite

01:10:13.439 --> 01:10:22.880
with my family. So, after I was released, I could see Jehovah's salvation. I want to repay his

01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:29.520
kindness. So, I tried to find where his kingdom hall, where his watch tower branch,

01:10:33.359 --> 01:10:41.279
14 days later, it means in February 15th, my son said, mommy, you are to find watch tower branch.

01:10:41.279 --> 01:10:47.439
I said, yes, please, and it led me as the telephone company. And he got a number, and brother

01:10:47.439 --> 01:10:54.560
again, it was on the phone. So, my son said, my mother wants to meet you. Who is your mother?

01:10:54.560 --> 01:11:02.159
Nancy Yuan. Oh, Nancy, she's in China, she's in the prison. We don't know whether she's still alive

01:11:02.159 --> 01:11:13.039
or not. Who? My mother said, no, she's here. So, ask her, come. So, I went to Bethel, and after 23

01:11:13.039 --> 01:11:20.239
years, I finally back to my mother, and met my brothers. She says, I'm so happy and my tears.

01:11:21.439 --> 01:11:28.479
So, I cried a long, long time, and they interviewed me. So, my article was published at July 15th,

01:11:28.479 --> 01:11:41.789
for 79. I'm very ignorant and very incapable. Just like I said, I said, just a little dirt,

01:11:41.789 --> 01:11:52.640
because I'm nothing. Not only we go to all meetings, or we go to fearsome, or I can't

01:11:52.640 --> 01:12:01.680
harm anybody, but study. No, that's not enough. You have to work hard on your spiritual word.

01:12:02.720 --> 01:12:09.520
Because a long, long time, all my freedom had been taken away. And physically, I couldn't do

01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:15.359
anything, but my spiritual word, the inner word, I have a fourth freedom.

01:12:19.170 --> 01:12:26.289
Jehovah God's universe is sovereignty, not yet vindicated. So, I pray to Jehovah, I'm still in

01:12:26.289 --> 01:12:34.770
the prison of the old system of things. I never forget this. Until the day, the great day of Jehovah,

01:12:34.770 --> 01:12:40.050
then Jehovah will vindicate to his universal sovereignty and his divine name.

01:12:41.649 --> 01:12:48.930
Keep this in my mind. So, anything I face, Jehovah, for your namesake, please help me.

01:12:51.329 --> 01:12:59.329
There's no question that Jehovah's Holy Spirit strengthens Sister Ewan. Remember that the same

01:12:59.329 --> 01:13:06.050
Holy Spirit that helped her stay faithful in prison can help you to take the needed steps

01:13:06.050 --> 01:13:13.090
to return to Jehovah. And when you do that, Jehovah will gladly welcome you home.

01:13:13.890 --> 01:13:19.729
The feeling you will experience is beautifully captured in the following music video.

01:13:20.369 --> 01:13:24.369
It's entitled Jehovah welcomes you home.

01:15:08.130 --> 01:16:30.939
We hope that this month's broadcast has made it clear that as 1 Peter 5 and verse 7 states,

01:16:31.579 --> 01:16:39.340
Jehovah cares for you. The governing body is wholeheartedly praying that the message in this

01:16:39.340 --> 01:16:45.100
program will move many to return to the loving arms of Jehovah.

01:16:46.460 --> 01:16:53.420
JW Broadcasting itself has been a loving provision that demonstrates Jehovah's care for his people.

01:16:54.220 --> 01:17:01.260
Since it began in October 2014, the response from our brothers and sisters has been

01:17:01.260 --> 01:17:07.100
overwhelming, and we are happy to announce that starting with the December program,

01:17:07.739 --> 01:17:13.020
the governing body is making arrangements for you to become better acquainted with some of

01:17:13.020 --> 01:17:19.739
the helpers to governing body committees. In December, a helper to the teaching committee will

01:17:19.739 --> 01:17:27.020
anchor the entire program. Governing body members and helpers will alternate hosting the monthly

01:17:27.020 --> 01:17:35.100
program every other month. We are sure you will enjoy this new arrangement. We'd like to

01:17:35.100 --> 01:17:42.300
conclude the program with these greetings from our 25 brothers and sisters in the Tarnabe congregation

01:17:42.300 --> 01:17:49.260
in Honduras. They face a unique challenge to reach some of their territory, often beginning their

01:17:49.260 --> 01:17:57.420
work before dawn to avoid the suffocating heat and traveling many miles by boat to visit remote

01:17:57.420 --> 01:18:04.460
islands. Most of the congregation's 70 Bible studies are conducted with fishermen on these

01:18:04.460 --> 01:18:12.380
islands who are happy to discuss the Bible on the beach or seashore. Bible students must overcome

01:18:12.380 --> 01:18:19.020
community pressure in order to progress spiritually and abandon pagan customs and traditions.

01:18:20.220 --> 01:18:25.579
Six Spanish-speaking publishers have made a special effort to learn the local language,

01:18:25.579 --> 01:18:32.859
which is called Garifuna, to be able to support the preaching work. We pray that Jehovah continues

01:18:32.859 --> 01:18:38.939
to bless our brothers and sisters in this congregation and all of you around the world.

01:18:38.939 --> 01:18:43.739
This is JW Broadcasting in Brooklyn, New York.
