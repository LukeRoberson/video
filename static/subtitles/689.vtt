00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:12.140
Brazil is the largest country in South America,

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:17.140
from the Amazon rainforest to rich farmland

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:23.899
and a beautiful coastline. Paraguay borders Brazil

00:00:23.899 --> 00:00:26.899
and is the eighth largest country in South America.

00:00:26.899 --> 00:00:32.899
Its diverse geography includes major rivers, vast plains

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:34.899
and fertile farmland.

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:37.899
We wondered how the Bethel families in those countries

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:41.899
were doing after some two-and-a-half years of the COVID-19 pandemic.

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:44.899
Brother Dalinger and I, along with our wives,

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:47.899
Lordis and Angela, began our journey from Warwick Bethel

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:50.899
with a flight to São Paulo, Brazil.

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:53.899
But, after the recent presidential election,

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:57.899
large protests in São Paulo were blocking key roads,

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.899
including the road from the airport to the branch office.

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:06.900
But Jehovah provided an unexpected solution.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.900
Thanks to the generosity of a witness family,

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.900
we were transported from the airport in record time.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.900
We had no problem finding a parking space on the Bethel Soccer Field.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.909
The branch is located in a rural area

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:28.909
and serves as a home to some 1200 volunteers.

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:32.909
During our visit, the entire Bethel family enjoyed morning worship

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.909
and breakfast in the dining room.

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.909
Dear Maos, bongea.

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.909
Are you excited to be here for the branch visit?

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:44.909
We are too.

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.909
One of the first stops on our tour was the large printer.

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:52.909
In harmony with the governing body's desire to provide printed material,

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:57.909
Brazil produced publications in 65 languages last year.

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:00.909
Brazil also serves as a warehousing branch.

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:01.909
What is that?

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:05.909
It means Brazil can print, stock, and ship literature

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.909
directly to individual congregations in Paraguay, Argentina,

00:02:09.909 --> 00:02:13.909
Uruguay, Bolivia, Chile, and Peru.

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:17.909
Brazil also ships publications to branches in Colombia,

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:22.909
Mexico, the United States, South Africa, Germany, and Japan.

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:26.909
In addition, there are ten remote translation offices

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:30.909
that translate our publications into other languages spoken in Brazil.

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:33.909
Brazil Bethel has two museums.

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:37.909
One is devoted to the history of Bible translation,

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:41.909
and the other shows the history of Jehovah's people in Brazil.

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:45.909
The Brazil branch also provides the art department in Patterson

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:48.909
with photos and artwork for our publications.

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:54.770
Perhaps you recognize some of these scenes.

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:58.770
Under the oversight of audio video services at headquarters,

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.770
Brazil has a regional video team.

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.770
Ready, set, action.

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:09.770
With all of this activity and over 900,000 publishers to support,

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:12.770
the branch is being renovated and modernized.

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:15.770
Many commuter Bethelites are sharing in this project,

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:18.770
and as you can see, all are happy to help.

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:21.770
Another highlight of our visit was the special dinner

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:25.770
with the Bethel family, which featured the Bethel chorus,

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:27.770
traditional dancing,

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:32.770
and some excellent field service experiences.

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:35.770
Naturally, we couldn't wait to see for ourselves

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:37.770
what field service was like.

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:42.770
And sure enough, we found that both in the rural areas and in the city,

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:47.770
people were polite, easy to talk with, and receptive to the Kingdom message.

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:52.770
We couldn't help but think that many more may yet come into Jehovah's organization

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:54.770
in this large country.

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:57.770
At the assembly hall on the branch property,

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:00.770
we were able to enjoy a special program with the Bethel family

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:05.770
and nearby congregations, over 2000 attended.

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:08.770
After our final meal with the Bethel family,

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:12.770
it was hard to hold back the tears as we set our farewells.

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:16.769
But just before our departure, we heard of more road blockages.

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:21.769
Would we be able to get to São Paulo in time for our flight?

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:23.769
Absolutely.

00:04:23.769 --> 00:04:31.949
Upon our arrival in Paraguay Bethel,

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:34.949
we were surprised and overwhelmed.

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:36.949
What a welcome.

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:41.949
The Paraguay branch is located just outside the capital city of Assunce Young.

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:45.949
Just a block down the street, a beautiful new assembly hall

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:50.949
and school for Kingdom evangelizers' facility were nearing completion.

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:55.949
The enthusiasm of the construction volunteers was contagious.

00:04:55.949 --> 00:04:58.949
Just a few weeks after our visit,

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:01.949
the assembly hall and school facility were completed.

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:07.300
There are about 100 members in the Paraguay Bethel family,

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:11.300
which cares for the 11,000 publishers in the country.

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:15.300
The largest department at the branch is translation.

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.300
These dear brothers and sisters devote much effort

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:22.300
to translate our publications and our website into the Guadani language.

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:26.300
This is proved to be a blessing for honest-hearted ones

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.300
throughout the country.

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:32.300
For example, we learned of a Guadani speaking woman named Angelina.

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:36.300
During the pandemic, Angelina studied the Bible by cell phone.

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:41.300
But because she lives in a remote location, electricity is unreliable.

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:44.300
But that did not deter Angelina.

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:47.300
For her Bible study, Angelina walked four kilometers

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:50.300
or two and a half miles round trip to charge her cell phone.

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:54.300
As she progressed, she walked that distance more often

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.300
than she could connect to our meetings.

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:58.300
Was it worth the effort?

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:00.300
Today, Angelina is now baptized

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.300
and her husband is studying the Bible.

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:06.300
We were curious about what we would find in the ministry.

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:09.300
In one city park, virtually everyone we spoke with

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:13.300
was polite, humble, and willing to talk.

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:16.300
The next day, despite an outbreak of COVID-19,

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:19.300
we enjoyed a special meeting that was transmitted

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:22.300
to all congregations throughout the country.

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:26.300
The program featured experiences that highlighted the progress of the preaching work.

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:31.300
No doubt, many more will respond to the Kingdom message in Paraguay.

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:34.300
For the special meal with the Bethel family,

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:39.300
we enjoyed delicious food along with traditional dancing and singing.

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:43.300
We also enjoyed hearing nice experiences of Bethelites

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:46.300
who witnessed by letter and telephone during the pandemic.

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:51.920
Yes, as was true of Brazil,

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:55.920
the Paraguay Bethel family is united and joyful.

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:57.920
Many in the Bethel family said,

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:02.920
we did not realize how much we needed this visit.

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:05.920
Truly, these visits are evidence of the governing body's love

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:12.290
and caring for our Bethel family's worldwide.

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:15.290
As you can imagine, it was hard to tear ourselves away

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:17.290
from our dear brothers and sisters,

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:21.290
but we rejoiced in seeing how Jehovah has so lovingly cared

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:26.019
for them during the past few years.

00:07:26.019 --> 00:07:28.019
We will remember them fondly.

00:07:28.019 --> 00:07:34.259
Both Bethel families send their warm love to the governing body.
