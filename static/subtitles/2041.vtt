00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:10.789
For over 60 years, the New World translation of the Bible has been printed and distributed

00:00:10.789 --> 00:00:14.029
by Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:00:14.029 --> 00:00:21.230
The Witnesses are known worldwide as a people who not only print Bibles, but use them extensively.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:26.870
They use their Bibles in their personal reading, in their congregation meetings, and in their

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:30.140
public ministry.

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:36.740
As a result, many have worn out multiple copies.

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:42.820
At the 2013 Annual Meeting of Jehovah's Witnesses, an updated version of the New World Translation

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:51.880
in English was released to a worldwide audience of more than 1.4 million.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:57.859
This revised version is easier to read and understand.

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:06.019
New features include custom design fonts, new study tools, and a beautiful new cover.

00:01:06.019 --> 00:01:11.140
A lot of research went into the construction of this Bible.

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.260
One goal was to produce a cover that could withstand the rigorous use that Jehovah's Witnesses

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.420
would give it.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:26.780
Many thousands of hours were spent selecting, testing, and evaluating special materials.

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:32.260
For example, a polyurethane product was selected that is highly durable.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:37.340
This material feels like soft leather and does not crease when folded.

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:44.219
Over 1,690 sample Bibles were field tested in all types of climates.

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:48.819
Those who did the testing submitted their observations and provided valuable information that was

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:53.180
used to improve the manufacturing process.

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:58.780
To produce this special book, new Bindry equipment was installed in both Wal-Kill, New York,

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.019
USA, and in Ebina, Japan.

00:02:03.019 --> 00:02:08.620
This included new machines that cut the polyurethane cover material, new case makers that assemble

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:14.539
the cover components, and new burnishing machines that apply the title.

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:19.780
The title will not rub off because an additive in the cover material reacts to heat and

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.419
pressure, resulting in recess lettering that is part of the cover.

00:02:25.419 --> 00:02:30.300
The materials typically used to line books produce covers that curled.

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:36.020
To solve the problem, Prynery personnel tested more than 580 combinations of liner materials

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:37.740
and glues.

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:43.580
A unique combination of glue and liner was found that produces a durable cover that stays

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.800
flat.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.520
The design of the new cover was also carefully considered.

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.719
Many different colors and embossing styles were produced.

00:02:55.719 --> 00:03:01.639
In all, 146 samples were tested before the governing body of Jehovah's Witnesses selected

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:04.800
the one to be used.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:11.120
Why was so much time, money, and effort spent to produce this beautiful new Bible?

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:16.759
Because Jehovah's Witnesses believe that the Bible is God's Word to mankind.

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:23.159
No other book contains the comfort, encouragement, and practical guidance that can be found in

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:24.159
its pages.
