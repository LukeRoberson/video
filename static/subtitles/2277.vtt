00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:23.300
Look around us now, see the love on each face

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:32.719
Out there in the world, hard to find

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:49.170
And soon, glad to leave that old face that's promised

00:00:49.670 --> 00:01:18.560
A jar of wine, that's what we need

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:48.400
And the love, like the cares of the yesterday

00:01:48.400 --> 00:02:12.240
And feels joy, when we share faith and rest from it

00:02:12.240 --> 00:03:04.740
That's what you, that's what you
