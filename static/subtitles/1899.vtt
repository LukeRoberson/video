00:00:01.389 --> 00:00:07.030
Brothers and sisters, welcome to this update.

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:13.470
The Omicron variant of the COVID-19 virus has quickly spread throughout the world.

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:16.829
The number of cases has exploded.

00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:25.949
We're saddened to report that as of Friday, January 21st, 26,813 of our brothers have

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.910
now died from COVID-19.

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.590
But there have been some encouraging developments.

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:41.109
For those who are vaccinated, cases of Omicron are generally milder and have not led to hospitalization

00:00:41.109 --> 00:00:43.070
or death.

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:48.350
For example, you may have heard reports that there has been a major outbreak of Omicron

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.350
in Puerto Rico.

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.990
You may also know that Puerto Rico has a very high rate of vaccination.

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:03.270
Although 551 cases were reported among our brothers during the recent outbreak, only

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:09.030
three of our brothers have died, and it is our understanding that all of them had serious

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.829
underlying health issues.

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:19.109
Even one death is too many, yet we're relieved that so few died.

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:24.269
Our hearts go out to all who have lost loved ones.

00:01:24.269 --> 00:01:26.549
Please continue to be careful.

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:32.549
The pandemic is not over, and we need to continue to take practical steps to protect

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.670
our lives and our health.

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:43.349
In addition to the pandemic, it has been sobering to watch recent world events unfold.

00:01:43.349 --> 00:01:49.709
We see one natural disaster after another, and we hear threats of war.

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:56.069
The King of the North and the King of the South continue pushing one another.

00:01:56.069 --> 00:02:01.469
When we hear all these things happening in the world, it reminds us how vital it is

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.150
that we keep on the watch.

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:10.030
We need to stay awake spiritually and not doze off or get distracted.

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.710
Why?

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:16.990
Because we are living in the most critical time in human history.

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:24.030
Jesus knew that the last days would bring challenges that would test our spiritual focus.

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:34.710
Out of his deep love, he urged his followers, as recorded at Luke 21 verses 34 through 36.

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.830
But pay attention to yourselves.

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:43.710
That your hearts never become weighed down with overeating and heavy drinking and anxieties

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:50.310
of life, and suddenly that day be instantly upon you as a snare.

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.310
For it will come upon all those dwelling on the face of the whole earth.

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:02.509
Keep awake then, all the time making supplication that you may succeed in escaping all these

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:08.830
things that must occur and in standing before the Son of Man.

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:14.590
We constantly hear encouraging reports that you dear brothers and sisters are working

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:20.789
hard to keep awake and remain busy in your service to Jehovah.

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:26.550
You're busy in your personal ministry, writing letters, making phone calls, and looking

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:31.069
for opportunities to share the good news and formally.

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:36.349
And many were able to auxiliary pioneer during the recent campaign.

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:42.990
Staying busy in Jehovah's service is a protection for us, but more is required to protect

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:44.990
our hearts.

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:51.710
It's vital for all of us to keep awake, to be watchful of things that could pose a danger

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:55.150
to us spiritually.

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.270
What are some of these dangers?

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:04.509
Jesus mentioned things like overeating, heavy drinking, and anxieties of life.

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:10.469
What are some ways that these things could cause our hearts to become way down?

00:04:10.469 --> 00:04:18.709
First, let's talk about one common cause for anxiety, social isolation.

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:24.069
No doubt we have never felt as isolated as we have during this pandemic.

00:04:24.069 --> 00:04:32.670
True, it has been necessary to isolate ourselves physically to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:39.709
But if we're not careful, we could start to isolate ourselves in other ways.

00:04:39.709 --> 00:04:47.550
Maybe at times we feel Zoom fatigue, and we even want to isolate ourselves virtually.

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:49.910
What's the danger?

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:53.069
Proverbs 18 verse 1 says,

00:04:53.069 --> 00:04:58.629
Whoever isolates himself pursues his own selfish desires.

00:04:58.629 --> 00:05:02.750
He rejects all practical wisdom.

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:08.990
It takes effort to reach out to our brothers by telephone, by video conference, or even

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.990
with an email or text message.

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:19.389
But so often the encouragement that we receive from doing so makes the effort so worthwhile.

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:25.550
Often, we receive back more than what we may have given.

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:29.149
Just as Jesus said at Acts 20 verse 35,

00:05:29.149 --> 00:05:35.149
There is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving.

00:05:35.149 --> 00:05:41.149
An article on JW.org entitled How to Deal with Isolation

00:05:41.149 --> 00:05:46.870
Made an interesting point under the heading Cultivate Friendships.

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:50.709
Friendships benefit your mental and emotional health,

00:05:50.709 --> 00:05:55.949
and are even more important when face-to-face connections are difficult.

00:05:55.949 --> 00:06:02.029
If you are confined at home, you may be able to use video conferencing or voice calls

00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:07.189
to maintain existing friendships and build new ones.

00:06:07.189 --> 00:06:12.069
We need our brothers and sisters, and they need us.

00:06:12.069 --> 00:06:15.990
To have a friend, we must be a friend.

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:18.189
So be a friend.

00:06:18.189 --> 00:06:21.389
Could you reach out to someone this week?

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:27.269
Perhaps you can think of a friend whom you haven't been able to talk with for some time.

00:06:27.269 --> 00:06:35.310
The joy of speaking with your friend will no doubt calm some of the anxieties in your heart.

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:39.910
We can't wait to get back to our Kingdom Halls, assembly halls,

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:44.029
to have our large regional conventions, special conventions,

00:06:44.029 --> 00:06:47.430
and even international conventions.

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:53.189
In the meantime, we are grateful that we have other means to enjoy these programs

00:06:53.189 --> 00:07:01.509
such as Zoom, JW Stream, and in some cases, TV and radio.

00:07:01.509 --> 00:07:06.709
Of course, most congregations are using Zoom for their meetings.

00:07:06.709 --> 00:07:11.470
Isn't it encouraging to see our brothers and sisters faces?

00:07:11.509 --> 00:07:17.550
We appreciate being able to see them comment and see them singing from the heart.

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:22.470
This also helps us to fight feelings of isolation,

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:25.910
simply turning your camera on and smiling.

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:31.670
Even a simple wave can be such an encouragement to others.

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:38.750
And we can make it our goal to connect early and stay longer after the meeting.

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:43.149
We can enjoy visiting with the friends and breakout rooms.

00:07:43.149 --> 00:07:50.430
Brothers and sisters, these are some practical ways that we can fight back against feelings of isolation

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:56.829
and the anxiety that isolation can create in our hearts.

00:07:56.829 --> 00:08:01.949
Another danger that Jesus mentioned was heavy drinking.

00:08:01.949 --> 00:08:06.990
Of course, there's nothing wrong with drinking alcohol and moderation.

00:08:07.029 --> 00:08:11.389
The scriptures describe wine as a gift from God,

00:08:11.389 --> 00:08:16.829
designed to make the heart rejoice, but some caution is needed.

00:08:16.829 --> 00:08:18.589
Why?

00:08:18.589 --> 00:08:28.550
Remember, Jesus specifically cautioned that our hearts could become way down with heavy drinking.

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:36.950
Secular reports indicate that many people have increased their alcohol consumption during the pandemic.

00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:44.830
The article, Alcohol Consumption, how can you stay in control on JW.org states?

00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:50.909
Some people drink more alcohol when they feel stressed, lonely, or simply bored.

00:08:50.909 --> 00:08:54.029
Are you drinking more than you used to?

00:08:54.029 --> 00:09:02.549
If so, how can you make sure that your drinking does not get out of hand or lead to alcohol dependence?

00:09:02.549 --> 00:09:10.830
Even if a person does not get drunk, immoderate drinking can pose spiritual dangers.

00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:15.070
Isaiah chapter 5 and verse 11 says,

00:09:15.070 --> 00:09:19.549
Woe to those who get up early in the morning to drink alcohol,

00:09:19.549 --> 00:09:25.870
who linger late into the evening darkness until wine inflames them.

00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:27.789
Why these woes?

00:09:27.789 --> 00:09:32.830
Note the spiritual consequences in the second half of verse 12.

00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:40.429
They do not consider the activity of Jehovah, and they do not see the work of his hands.

00:09:40.429 --> 00:09:47.789
Immoderate drinking can weigh our hearts down and cause us to neglect spiritual things.

00:09:47.789 --> 00:09:54.590
It can cause us to slow down in the race for life, or even to stop running altogether.

00:09:54.590 --> 00:10:02.990
No wonder Jesus specifically mentioned it when discussing the need to keep awake spiritually.

00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:14.990
Why not review that article on JW.org, which features five tips to help us keep alcohol in its proper place?

00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:20.029
What is another potential danger to our spiritual alertness?

00:10:20.029 --> 00:10:23.710
Misuse of social media.

00:10:23.710 --> 00:10:28.029
There's been a lot of concern from governmental and medical authorities

00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:33.389
about the effect that social media is having on people's mental and emotional health.

00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:41.950
Even more important are the spiritual concerns, the content, the people, and the amount of time

00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:50.590
involved. It can be addictive. Brothers and sisters, if you decide to allow your family to use

00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:57.950
social media, please be alert. Make sure you have good association with those who promote

00:10:58.110 --> 00:11:02.269
good spiritual habits, whether on screen or off.

00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:12.029
The whiteboard animation, Be Social Network Smart, provides some good reminders on how to be balanced

00:11:12.029 --> 00:11:18.269
yet cautious when using social media. What's the final challenge we want to consider?

00:11:19.309 --> 00:11:25.870
Tests of neutrality. With so many different challenging situations in the world,

00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:32.110
and even the threat of war in some countries, we need to be sure that we are not allowing our

00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:38.990
hearts to take sides on these issues, how sad it has been to see simple public health measures

00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:47.389
like wearing masks, hand washing, physical distancing, and vaccinations become controversial,

00:11:47.389 --> 00:11:54.990
even political. Some of our brothers and sisters have been influenced by the political views of

00:11:54.990 --> 00:12:02.190
those in their community. Some have turned to the internet, and have been deeply influenced by

00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:10.509
official appearing websites filled with highly political propaganda. Brothers and sisters, be careful.

00:12:11.549 --> 00:12:17.789
Just because something appears on an official looking web page on the internet does not make it true.

00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:23.870
We must guard against the spirit of the world and remain neutral.

00:12:25.389 --> 00:12:33.470
How appropriate are Jesus' words? Pay attention to yourselves, that your hearts never become

00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:41.549
way down. Let's keep focused on God's kingdom as the only solution to this world's problems.

00:12:42.269 --> 00:12:49.549
What has helped some families to keep awake? Let's see as we watch the following video.

00:12:51.549 --> 00:12:58.669
During the pandemic, it was definitely difficult to keep a good routine, and it was very easy to

00:12:58.669 --> 00:13:05.789
form bad habits. During isolation, I spent more time in front of the computer and it disturbed my

00:13:05.789 --> 00:13:11.309
sleep pattern. I had to make an adjustment because with bad habits, you know, they're easy to form

00:13:11.309 --> 00:13:16.110
and hard to break. So I did a little bit of a replacement therapy, I call it, where you

00:13:16.909 --> 00:13:21.549
switch from mindless TV watching to something that's a little bit more profitable, which is our

00:13:21.549 --> 00:13:28.590
own TV station, JW Broadcasting. As I spent a lot of time watching television, I heard a lot of

00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:36.269
negative information about vaccination. I was frightened. I felt pressure from the media, and I decided

00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:47.220
not to get vaccinated for some time. We often asked Jehovah for guidance. The governing body updates

00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:55.220
were timely and helped us to make the right decisions. When the pandemic first started,

00:13:55.220 --> 00:14:01.539
I had a lot of free time on my hands, so I was just on social media all the time, or on technology

00:14:01.539 --> 00:14:06.179
all the time. Family worship was an excellent opportunity for us to be able to talk about social

00:14:06.259 --> 00:14:11.379
media to really get Jehovah's thinking on it and how we can balance it while not eliminating it

00:14:11.379 --> 00:14:17.220
completely so that we controlled it and it didn't control us. It was a slow process, but eventually,

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:24.820
I deleted my social media and began setting time limits for other apps that would take a lot of

00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:32.580
my time. Our family decided to spend more time together. We played music and dance together.

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:38.100
We played board games and went for walks together in the forest. That helped us to reduce the time

00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:46.740
we used for social media. I decided to keep my schedule busy, so I started a few new hobbies

00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:55.379
like knitting and gardening. I saw a lot of benefit in staying close to the congregation through

00:14:55.379 --> 00:15:01.379
Zoom. Even though Zoom is not easy for me, being able to spend time with people who are going through

00:15:01.379 --> 00:15:06.820
the same thing as I was was really beneficial. We could all talk about what we were dealing with

00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:12.100
and encourage each other as well. We arranged online Bible-based games through Zoom.

00:15:13.059 --> 00:15:18.419
I found it nice to use Zoom to connect with the congregation with events that were planned by

00:15:18.419 --> 00:15:23.620
those in our hall. Some of them were interviews with those who have been in our hall for a long time,

00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:30.019
so it was nice to hear those experiences and be able to draw closer to them. During the pandemic,

00:15:30.019 --> 00:15:35.299
I would reach out to others either a phone call or a little card or a text message or just

00:15:35.299 --> 00:15:40.580
dropping something off at someone's door. It helped me to feel closer to my brothers and sisters too.

00:15:41.059 --> 00:15:46.740
The governing body updates were an absolute lifeline. They were something that really helped

00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:52.740
to focus all of our activity. As parents, it helped us to have clear direction, so we felt like we

00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:58.980
were guided through the whole pandemic and encouraged at the same time. I also have been able to see

00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:05.779
Jehovah answer my personal prayers even more so and just how he is holding all of us up during

00:16:05.779 --> 00:16:10.740
this difficult time because I don't think any of us could get through this pandemic without him.

00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:19.549
We are proud of these families for keeping awake to spiritual dangers. Did you notice how they

00:16:19.549 --> 00:16:27.230
counteracted social isolation? They have reached out to others regularly. They use video conferencing to

00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:33.950
stay close to their congregations and dear friends. Did you notice how they address their use of

00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:41.389
social media? They talked about it as a family and decided either to reduce the time spent

00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:48.590
or eliminate it completely. They have also increased the time they spent together, including

00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:54.669
enjoyable outdoor activities. And how did they handle tests of neutrality?

00:16:55.629 --> 00:17:02.350
They prayed to Jehovah and trusted the information provided by the faithful and discrete slave

00:17:02.909 --> 00:17:12.349
in making their own personal decisions. Very soon, Jehovah's Day will come upon all the earth.

00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:20.430
It's vital that we keep awake. Now is not the time to become spiritually drowsy or distracted.

00:17:20.910 --> 00:17:31.470
Remember Jesus' words at Luke 21, 36, keep awake then all the time making supplication that you

00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:38.029
may succeed in escaping all these things that must occur and in standing before the Son of Man.

00:17:40.029 --> 00:17:47.869
By earnestly supplicating Jehovah and applying the fine direction we are receiving, we will be successful.

00:17:47.869 --> 00:17:57.869
From the world headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses, this is J. W. Broadcasting.
