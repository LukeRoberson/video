00:00:01.419 --> 00:00:06.980
By the time the Apostle Peter wrote the words of today's text, individuals who were Jews,

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:13.619
proselytes, Samaritans, and Gentiles had been brought into the Christian congregation as God's

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:17.260
people, the spiritual Israel of God.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:22.300
In the verse before today's text, Peter outlined what their mission was.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.579
Let's open to 1 Peter chapter 2 and read of that.

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:31.989
It's in verses 9 and 10 of 1 Peter 2.

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:40.229
He wrote, but you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for special

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:45.590
possession, that you should declare abroad the excellencies of the one who called you

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:51.109
out of darkness into his wonderful light, for you were once not a people, but now you

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:53.310
are God's people.

00:00:53.310 --> 00:01:00.909
And of course, this refers to the spirit anointed members of the congregation who would be responsible

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:04.709
for glorifying Jehovah's name as his witnesses.

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:10.189
And this harmonizes with what Peter had said years earlier in the first century governing

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:14.430
body meeting as reported in Acts chapter 15.

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:21.790
So let's turn there, Acts 15, and we will begin with verse 14.

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:26.269
It says, Simeon has related thoroughly how God, for the first time, turned his attention

00:01:26.269 --> 00:01:31.069
to the nations to take out of them a people for his name.

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:35.709
And with this, the words of the prophets agree, just as it is written, after these things,

00:01:35.709 --> 00:01:39.909
I will return and raise up again the tent of David that has fallen down.

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:45.269
I will rebuild his ruins and restore it so that the men who remain may earnestly seat

00:01:45.269 --> 00:01:51.269
Jehovah together with people of all the nations, people who are called by my name, says

00:01:51.269 --> 00:01:55.629
Jehovah, who is doing these things.

00:01:55.629 --> 00:02:01.950
Now what about the rest of us who are not anointed Christians, but who call ourselves Jehovah's

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:02.950
witnesses?

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.310
Are we also God's people, well, most certainly?

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.550
And what a proud honor it is for us to bear the name of the only true God.

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.710
But with that name goes responsibility.

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:18.949
One that other religious groups do not want to take on.

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:25.110
You see, we are under obligation to bear witness to Jehovah, to tell the truth about

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:31.270
him, and to expose false teachings that misrepresent Jehovah.

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:36.710
And a classic example of an unscriptural dogma that God's people have exposed is the

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:42.509
Trinity, which reminds me of another hoax that fooled many people who should have known

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:43.909
better.

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:52.830
It's the true story about a man named Van Migren, a Dutch artist born in 1889, who perpetrated

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:58.110
what may have been the most sensational art hoax of all time.

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.270
You see, he never won the critical acclaim that he thought he was due as an artist.

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:07.830
So to get back at the art critics, he decided to demonstrate his talent by producing a

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.310
painting that would fool them all.

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:18.069
And he set out to imitate the famous 17th century Dutch Impressionist Johannes Vermeer.

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:25.430
Van Migren spent four years figuring out how to make a new painting look 300 years old.

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:26.830
The canvas was easy part.

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:31.430
He just took a lesser known painting from the 17th century and removed the picture.

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.789
His biggest problem was getting oil paint to harden thoroughly, which usually takes

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:37.430
50 years.

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:43.669
He solved it by mixing his pigments with a synthetic resin instead of oil and then baking

00:03:43.669 --> 00:03:45.509
the canvas.

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:51.189
Van Migren produced six paintings that were passed off as Vermeers.

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:57.949
His greatest soul in 1937, it was entitled Christ and the Disciples at Emmaus.

00:03:57.949 --> 00:04:03.669
The most authoritative art historian of the day said it was a genuine Vermeer masterpiece

00:04:03.669 --> 00:04:09.270
untouched on the original canvas and that it had no restoration done to it.

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:12.150
But in reality, it was a fake.

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:17.550
The critics opinion was taken as gospel in the art world so much that this critic had

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:20.509
been nicknamed the Pope.

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:25.350
Eventually, though a chemical analysis proved the paint contained an ingredient that had

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:30.550
not been discovered until two centuries after Vermeer died and that's what exposed Van

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.470
Migren as a fraud.

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:39.629
Well, something similar went on during the apostasy that took place after the death of the Apostles.

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:46.910
Less than 300 years after the Bible was completed, a Trinitarian added to 1 John 5, 7 the words

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:54.149
in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost, and these three are one.

00:04:54.149 --> 00:04:59.949
However, this addition does not appear in the oldest Greek manuscripts proving it's

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:03.069
a fake, it's a corruption of God's word.

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:07.870
And yet for centuries, the Churches propagated the Trinity doctrine.

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:14.470
As recently as the 19th century, almost all Bible translations had this spurious addition.

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:22.230
As late as 1897, Pope Leo XIII upheld the corrupted text of the Latin Vulgate.

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:26.350
Interestingly, the new Catholic encyclopedia comments on this and says that Trinitarian

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:32.509
dogma is in the last analysis a late fourth century invention.

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:37.509
Among the Apostolic fathers, there had been nothing even remotely approaching such a mentality

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:39.790
or perspective.

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:46.550
Well, Jehovah's anointed witnesses firmly rejected Christenham's Trinity dogma.

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:54.310
In 1915, the Watchtower exposed the foolishness of teaching a doctrine that contradicts the Bible.

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:55.990
The Watchtower said,

00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:01.069
in what a jumble of contradictions and confusion do they find themselves who say

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:04.110
that Jesus and the Father are one God?

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:08.269
This would involve the idea that our Lord Jesus acted the hypocrite one on earth

00:06:08.269 --> 00:06:13.509
and only pretended to address God in prayer when He Himself was the same God.

00:06:13.509 --> 00:06:18.990
The Father has always been immortal, hence could not die, how then could Jesus have died?

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:22.069
The Scriptures declare, however, that He did die.

00:06:22.069 --> 00:06:26.149
If they admit that Jesus really died, they take the other horn of the dilemma.

00:06:26.149 --> 00:06:30.029
For believing that there are three gods are all one person as many do.

00:06:30.029 --> 00:06:33.230
When Jesus died, they must all three have died.

00:06:33.269 --> 00:06:36.189
If they all died, who raised them to life?

00:06:36.189 --> 00:06:38.670
How foolish all this sounds.

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:42.230
Shall we thus contradict the apostles and prophets in Jesus Himself

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:46.509
and ignore reason and common sense in order to hold to a dogma handed to us

00:06:46.509 --> 00:06:51.550
from the dark superstitious past by a corrupt apostate church?

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:55.350
Nay says the Watchtower.

00:06:55.350 --> 00:07:01.550
Well, Jehovah's people continue to uphold the excellencies of the only true God.
