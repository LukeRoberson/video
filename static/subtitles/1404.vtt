00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:01.940
Amen.

00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:02.940
Amen.

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:03.940
Thanks for that prayer.

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:04.940
Okay.

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:07.500
Before I make my first call, let me make sure I've got everything.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.980
I have my Bible out, I have my tablet open to JW Library, and here's what I plan to

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:15.669
say.

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:16.670
Looks good.

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:18.670
It's similar to what I'm going to say.

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:19.670
Okay.

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:20.670
Ready.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:28.730
My first call is to one of my workmates.

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:29.730
Hello?

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:30.730
Hello?

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:31.730
Is this Allison?

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:32.729
Yes.

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:33.729
This is Carmen from work.

00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:34.729
Oh, sure.

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:35.729
How are you doing?

00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:36.729
We're doing well.

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:37.729
Thanks.

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:41.090
Of course, the pandemic is causing challenges for everyone.

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.570
So I just wanted to make a brief call to check up on you.

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:45.090
How are you in the family doing?

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.609
That's so nice of you.

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:48.210
Thank you for asking.

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.890
My family is well, but like most people, we're struggling to make ends meet.

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.530
As you know, we haven't been going into work.

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.609
I'm worried about how long this pandemic will last.

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:01.009
I can understand that.

00:01:01.009 --> 00:01:06.450
These words that Isaiah 4110 have helped me to stay calm.

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.969
Where it reads, do not be afraid for I am with you.

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:14.329
Do not be anxious for I am your God.

00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:16.049
I will fortify you.

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.129
Yes.

00:01:17.129 --> 00:01:18.769
I will help you.

00:01:18.769 --> 00:01:23.370
I will really hold on to you with my right hand of righteousness.

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:25.290
Isn't that an encouraging verse?

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.290
It is.

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.930
And according to this, where can we go for help when we're anxious and afraid?

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.930
Well, God can help us to stay calm.

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:34.930
Yes.

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:40.530
One way he does that is by giving us hope that soon all sickness will end.

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.650
May I call again to share that promise with you in the Bible?

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:44.650
Sure.

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:46.650
How about if I call this time tomorrow?

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:47.650
Okay.

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:48.650
That'll be fine.

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.890
In the meantime, I can text you where you can find the scripture in your own Bible.

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:53.890
Great.

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.730
Enjoy the rest of your evening, Allison.

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:56.730
Goodbye.

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:58.049
Bye.

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.329
What a nice conversation.

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.530
How will you answer that question about the end of sickness?

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.010
I thought I'd read to her Revelation 21, 3 and 4.

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.330
Before I forget, let me text her that scripture in Isaiah.

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.849
Should I include anything else?

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:12.810
You could include a link to one of our videos.

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.810
Good idea.

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.930
I think I'll send her the short version of why I studied the Bible.

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:17.449
Perfect.
