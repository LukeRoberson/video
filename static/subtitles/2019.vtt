00:00:02.259 --> 00:00:06.259
and introduction to the book of Ecclesiastes.

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:12.259
King Solomon, who ruled over Israel from Jerusalem, wrote this book.

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:16.260
Ecclesiastes was completed many years into Solomon's reign,

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.260
but before his fall into idolatry.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:24.260
Ecclesiastes contains twelve chapters.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:30.260
In chapter one, Solomon discusses the futility of human activity.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:37.259
In chapter two, he looks for meaning in life by evaluating his many pursuits.

00:00:37.259 --> 00:00:42.259
Solomon writes that pursuing wealth and magnificent accomplishments

00:00:42.259 --> 00:00:45.259
is like chasing after the wind.

00:00:45.259 --> 00:00:53.259
Chapters 3-6 present observations by Solomon that help us cultivate godly wisdom.

00:00:53.259 --> 00:00:57.259
He shows that there is an appointed time for everything.

00:00:57.259 --> 00:01:03.259
He encourages hard work, and he extolls the benefits of friendship.

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:10.260
He refers to the enjoyment of food and the rejoicing over one's work as the gift of God.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:17.260
Chapter 7-11 provide a sobering discussion of life in this world.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.260
Solomon observes that life is short,

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:26.260
and that man needs to use his time, energy, and resources in the best way possible.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:32.260
This will help him make a good name, a reputation with God.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
Did you know?

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:42.260
Solomon alluded to the earth's water cycle centuries before scientists understood this process.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:51.260
In chapter 12, he encourages young ones to make wise choices before the challenges of old age arrive.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.260
Then he sums up all that he discussed with the words,

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.260
fear the true God, and keep his commandments.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.260
For this is the whole obligation of man.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.260
As you meditate on the book of Ecclesiastes,

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.259
note which pursuits are futile and which are worthwhile.

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.259
How godly wisdom helps us enjoy the gift of life,

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:19.259
and how cultivating a relationship with God leads to a truly meaningful life

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:22.259
under the rule of God's kingdom.
