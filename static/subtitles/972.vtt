00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:04.519
What comes to your mind when you hear the word dishonesty?

00:00:05.519 --> 00:00:08.480
Maybe you think of Satan the father of the lie

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:15.000
Or an aniahs in his wife comes to your mind. They lost their lives because of lying

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.879
We do not want to imitate such ones. We avoid lying

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.199
Is that though as far as our honesty goes?

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:34.880
Our Holy God Jehovah wants us to be holy as well and that is why He urged the ancient Israelites

00:00:35.439 --> 00:00:41.079
not to deceive others as mentioned in Leviticus 19, verse 11

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.920
Does this not add some color to honesty?

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:51.920
This honesty includes and please take note of this definition

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:57.119
Intentionally leading someone to a wrong conclusion

00:00:57.759 --> 00:01:01.359
For example, by twisting the truth or by

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.959
Providing only certain details we endanger our peace with others

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.560
Why can we say so?

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.200
How does this honesty wreck peace?

00:01:13.959 --> 00:01:18.439
Peace and a peaceful relationship are built on trust

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:25.519
Trusting someone makes you feel safe and secure, puts you at ease

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.319
There is no peace without trust

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:32.719
How do we develop trust?

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:37.120
Trust is the result of spending time together

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.920
Speaking the truth with one another

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:46.760
We trust people that act unselfishly and do not use crooked speech as the Bible puts it

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.239
If someone deceived us only once or was dishonest in another way

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.959
We might start to question everything they say

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.719
One single act of dishonesty may be enough

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:06.109
It can ruin their reputation as bad as this is

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:10.270
This honesty has the potential to create even greater damage

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:16.270
This honesty can be compared with a highly contagious virus

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.870
This honesty breeds this honesty

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:28.870
People who have contact with deceitful dishonet person are in danger of being infected

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:34.150
This honesty might not only wreck one relationship

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:40.430
But multiple relationships putting the unity and peace of the whole group at risk

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:49.500
This reminds us of the relationship between Laban and Jacob and the Bible book of Genesis

00:02:50.219 --> 00:02:58.460
Based on the agreement with Laban, Jacob worked hard for seven years in order to marry Laban's daughter Rachel

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:09.340
And despite this high price, that Jacob had to pay, those years seemed for him just like a few days

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:16.259
Sadly, instead of Rachel, he received the older daughter, Leah as wife

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.699
So now, Leah was also part of the deception

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.810
What was the result after Jacob had found out that Laban tricked him?

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.210
The trust was gone. The relationship had suffered to a great degree

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:37.689
This honesty wrecked the peace in those relationships

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:42.129
And so the following seven years of work for Rachel were bitter

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:48.050
And Laban's dishonesty emboldened him to continue in his course

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:52.169
He unfairly jained Jacob's rages ten times

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.729
He deceived Jacob

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:01.050
Because of Laban's dishonesty, the peace and the whole family was disrupted

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:08.120
Let us now continue to watch the next segment of the dramatization

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:11.560
We left Emily and Celia sitting in a coffee shop

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:18.439
Please watch carefully and notice how Emily is tempted to alter the truth

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:24.230
I am concerned

00:04:25.029 --> 00:04:26.230
Concern is good

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:27.269
But

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:31.670
Is there just a little bit of Emily in there?

00:04:34.519 --> 00:04:36.040
I thought you would understand

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:40.379
I think I understand your feelings

00:04:41.019 --> 00:04:42.060
Not about Hailey

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:45.100
I haven't seen all her posts

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:47.500
There's nothing immoral is there

00:04:49.579 --> 00:04:50.060
No

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.339
Good, that's not like her

00:04:54.860 --> 00:05:01.579
Now, if it's the case of her being not careful, how she comes across, that's another matter

00:05:02.459 --> 00:05:03.660
Why don't you talk to her?

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:10.490
Maybe

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:15.930
Emily, you are a beautiful, spiritual sister

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:22.889
You know, for years

00:05:26.019 --> 00:05:29.540
I had a bad habit comparing myself to others

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:34.899
My own insecurity hurt me

00:05:35.939 --> 00:05:37.300
And my closest friends

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.959
So, you don't think I should have spoken to Celia

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:54.680
Oh, I'm glad you've asked Celia about it

00:05:55.959 --> 00:05:56.839
Tell me when you trust

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:00.019
What did she say?

00:06:00.819 --> 00:06:02.819
Well, she definitely understands how I feel

00:06:04.019 --> 00:06:08.279
Good, how about Hailey's posts?

00:06:09.079 --> 00:06:12.920
Well, she hasn't seen everything she has out there

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:14.680
Hmm

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:17.959
She did say that

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.639
Hailey needs to be more careful

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:23.800
How she comes across

00:06:28.379 --> 00:06:29.420
What did she suggest?

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:34.540
I should tell her that she needs to stop

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:36.699
But, I'm too worked up

00:06:41.079 --> 00:06:41.480
Look

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:47.740
If Celia agrees that Hailey's doing something she shouldn't

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:51.180
You should talk to her

00:06:56.089 --> 00:06:57.290
You'll find the right time

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:08.120
Thanks for understanding

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:10.379
Hungry

00:07:11.259 --> 00:07:12.220
Can you say the prayer?

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:12.939
Sure

00:07:16.019 --> 00:07:20.579
Jehovah, we would like to praise you for your generosity and kind

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:30.920
Did you notice how Emily just heard what you wanted to hear?

00:07:31.879 --> 00:07:36.519
In talking to her husband, Jake, she painted an incomplete picture

00:07:36.519 --> 00:07:41.800
She did not relay that Celia had no opinion about the social media posts of Hailey

00:07:42.439 --> 00:07:49.079
And, contrary to what she told her husband, Celia did not encourage her to tell Hailey to stop

00:07:50.439 --> 00:07:52.680
Our brothers and sisters deserve the truth

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:56.040
But Emily didn't relay that, did she?

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.439
She was dishonest

00:07:58.439 --> 00:08:02.279
Something that can have a damaging effect as we will see later

00:08:03.079 --> 00:08:09.480
Jehovah wants us to put away this peace record, this honesty

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:14.279
He wants us to always be truthful, even in small matters

00:08:15.079 --> 00:08:19.160
Therefore, how do we put away this honesty?

00:08:21.079 --> 00:08:23.800
Let us please turn to Ephesians chapter 4

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:29.399
Here the Apostle Paul reminds us of a reason to be honest

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:32.360
This is Ephesians chapter 4

00:08:32.919 --> 00:08:35.399
And we want to read verse 25

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:44.200
Therefore, now that you have put away this seed, each one of you speak truth with his neighbor

00:08:44.919 --> 00:08:48.759
Because we are members belonging to one another

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:56.039
Did you notice why we put away this seed and speak truth with one another?

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.559
Paul says, because we are members belonging to one another

00:09:01.559 --> 00:09:07.240
In other words, Paul reminds us of the fact that this honesty affects others

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:09.879
Our brothers, our relationship with them

00:09:10.759 --> 00:09:15.879
So then, knowing this, how can we put away this honesty?

00:09:16.759 --> 00:09:17.639
The answer is

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:23.480
By considering the consequences of this honesty and honesty

00:09:23.879 --> 00:09:26.360
This will help us to do the right thing

00:09:27.799 --> 00:09:31.159
Now, what are the consequences of this honesty?

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:38.679
As we have seen in the case of Laban and Jacob, it will disrupt the peace with others

00:09:39.559 --> 00:09:45.960
And since Jehovah hates this honesty, it will also disrupt our peace with Jehovah

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:53.159
On the other hand, what are the consequences of honesty?

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:58.200
While this honesty might seem in the moment to be the easier way out

00:09:58.759 --> 00:09:59.720
In the long run

00:10:00.679 --> 00:10:03.720
Honest people enable us to have good friends

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:11.399
They want to enjoy peace as well and therefore, they are also searching for someone they can trust

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:14.600
In this way, we are like

00:10:15.639 --> 00:10:18.440
Body members belonging to one another

00:10:19.159 --> 00:10:25.159
And even more importantly, we will enjoy a good conscience

00:10:26.039 --> 00:10:27.399
Peace with God

00:10:28.919 --> 00:10:36.120
Let us therefore put away this peace record dishonesty by sticking to the truth even in small things

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:41.159
Dear brothers and sisters, Jehovah knows that for us imperfect humans

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:43.320
This is not always easy

00:10:44.279 --> 00:10:55.799
Yet he promises to help us and to bless every step we take to build trust and peace and not to wreck it

00:10:57.799 --> 00:11:03.960
Brother Patrick LaFranca, a helper to the personnel committee will now present the next talk of this symposium

00:11:04.679 --> 00:11:06.200
Put away peace records

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:09.320
Harmful gossip
