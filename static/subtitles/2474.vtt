00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:19.359
Good morning students, this is your principal Rodriguez and I'm very happy to announce that soon

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:27.160
We're going to have our annual holiday party. Isn't that exciting? So get ready for games treats and more

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.480
It's gonna be great

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:35.799
Okay, everything settle down

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.240
We'll see you all tomorrow

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:48.259
See you there Sophia. Oh wait, you can't go

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:55.600
Well, that's all for today

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.400
Before I go we'd like to announce the award for a student of the month which goes to

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Caleb wait a go

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:14.060
Wow, look at Caleb. That's my little brother

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:18.859
With Jehovah's help. He tries to be good in school. I like learning about Jehovah

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.420
Are you ready to study? Oh, I'll get my book

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:39.819
I'll meet you outside. Okay. Hey, Zoe. Hey, what you doing?

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:45.060
I'm just about to meet Sophia

00:01:46.379 --> 00:01:51.060
Why do you hang out with her? She's so

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.900
Different

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:00.519
Weird

00:02:00.519 --> 00:02:07.810
She never does anything fun. You're different, Zoe

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.810
But in a cool way

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:16.210
You should hang out with us not that user

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:19.050
Angela

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.050
Please see me immediately

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:24.129
See you later, Zoe

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:38.500
Does it bother you that others think you're different?

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:50.250
What do you mean the other kids say things like it's weird you can't celebrate holidays and

00:02:51.129 --> 00:03:20.849
That you can't have fun what of course we can have fun

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:27.409
It can be hard sometimes, but it's good to be different like Jesus

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.530
Like Jesus

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:35.050
Yeah, that's right. We learn a lot about him at family worship

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:37.770
In the Bible

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:41.210
Jesus said his followers would be no part of the world

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.250
What do you think it means to be no part of the world?

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:08.050
Saturday

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:33.139
That's a good guess

00:04:33.339 --> 00:04:35.339
But we don't have to leave the planet

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:41.740
He said that he did not want to take his followers out of the world, but

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:44.420
That they should be no part of the world

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:47.420
That's right, honey

00:04:48.579 --> 00:04:57.939
What else did Jesus say they are no part of the world just as I am no part of the world

00:04:58.939 --> 00:05:02.180
How was Jesus no part of the world?

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.540
Let's see

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:09.779
Jesus was different from everyone else and so were his friends

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:14.220
He showed others how to be different and what they did

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:18.860
What they said and even how they thought

00:05:19.939 --> 00:05:21.939
Really how?

00:05:22.899 --> 00:05:26.420
People aren't always nice to others. They think are different

00:05:27.019 --> 00:05:32.730
But Jesus wanted to help everyone and that made some people

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:34.970
very angry

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:37.290
They wanted Jesus to be more like them

00:05:38.529 --> 00:05:44.569
But he didn't worry about what they thought because who did Jesus want to be like?

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:51.829
That's right. Jehovah said that those who obeyed his voice were special to him

00:05:52.709 --> 00:05:57.870
So when you love and obey Jehovah and you are no part of the world like Jesus

00:05:58.709 --> 00:06:06.449
That makes you special to him. I don't know if it could ever be like you

00:06:11.829 --> 00:06:23.519
What do you mean? I don't know I?

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:57.029
I got to go

00:06:57.029 --> 00:07:35.420
No, but you're over that makes you special to him. Hey, it's a leopard

00:07:35.899 --> 00:07:52.519
Get away

00:07:52.519 --> 00:08:42.029
We don't want you here if you just want to

00:08:42.269 --> 00:08:43.269
You

00:08:43.269 --> 00:08:56.750
You can make me clean. I want to be made clean

00:08:57.230 --> 00:09:19.639
This isn't one of us

00:09:19.879 --> 00:09:33.059
Jesus was different in what he did said and thought. I'm sorry about your grandma. This is for you. It will help you feel better

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:38.500
Thank you and that made some people very angry

00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:47.830
Oops, I didn't see you there

00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:50.950
Are you okay?

00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:53.509
Let me help

00:09:53.509 --> 00:10:02.909
Sometimes they pick on me too. If people aren't always nice to others that they think are different

00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:07.389
You should hang out with us. No, that is her

00:10:09.029 --> 00:10:15.110
But Jesus wanted to be like his father Jehovah and that's what made him special

00:10:15.669 --> 00:10:19.750
Hey, darling. How was your study with Sophia?

00:10:20.950 --> 00:10:22.470
Mom

00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:24.870
There's something I want to show you. Oh, okay

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:38.360
Enjoy the holiday party

00:10:38.679 --> 00:10:45.600
Hey Zoe

00:10:45.600 --> 00:11:01.879
Aren't you coming? Let me show you how it's done. Hi guys

00:11:02.919 --> 00:11:13.490
You didn't go to the party. I want to do the right thing. Okay. Let's have some fun. Oh

00:11:17.289 --> 00:11:19.289
Not again
