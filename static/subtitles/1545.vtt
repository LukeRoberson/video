00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:16.089
When I started learning sign language, it just seemed to come natural for me.

00:00:16.089 --> 00:00:29.339
After I transferred to the congregation, I remember feeling so happy.

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:44.100
I was pioneering and really enjoying this new way of communicating.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:53.390
It's funny how the thing you love can also be the thing that tests you.

00:00:53.390 --> 00:01:01.039
Soon I took the test for a sign language interpreter.

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:04.040
I couldn't believe I passed.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:11.609
I loved my new job.

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:14.609
My hope was that it would support my pioneering.

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:16.609
And maybe?

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:24.340
Allow me to travel one day to a country and preach where there was a need for sign language.

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.340
My boss was very happy with my work.

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:34.909
So much so that he began to give me more.

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:36.909
Everyone seemed appreciative.

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:57.099
And the extra money didn't hurt.

00:01:57.099 --> 00:02:00.599
It was handling it all fine.

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:47.500
Okay, for a while.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:54.099
My boss asked me to work full time for a few months to get some extra training.

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:57.099
The race could help me with planning my trip abroad.

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:05.699
I knew my parents would be concerned.

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:10.020
I knew because I felt it too.

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:13.020
I was already dragging physically.

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:17.020
But then again, it would only be for a few months.

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:20.020
I was really torn.

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:26.020
Dad kindly commended me for having good goals and trying my best to work toward them.

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:30.020
Then he showed me a scripture that really helped me.

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:33.020
First Timothy 416.

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:37.020
Pay constant attention to yourself and to your teaching.

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:40.020
Persevere in these things.

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:45.020
For by doing this, you will save both yourself and those who listen to you.

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:51.300
He helped me to see that Timothy set spiritual goals for himself growing up.

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.960
But Paul was now telling him,

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.960
don't stop.

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:01.750
Even though Timothy was a grown spiritual man,

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.750
Paul encouraged him to continue setting new spiritual goals.

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:14.469
In fact, to persevere in them was I persevering in.

00:04:14.469 --> 00:04:32.290
I kindly turned down the offer and explained to my boss that I'd like to keep my hours to a minimum.

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:43.360
So I could support my number one job.

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.899
It might take me longer to save my money.

00:04:47.899 --> 00:04:53.899
But I'll make that trip one day with Jehovah's help.

00:04:53.899 --> 00:04:57.899
And a little perseverance.
