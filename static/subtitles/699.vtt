WEBVTT

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:18.670
At this point in our program, we're going to move into the student portion, and we're

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:27.589
going to get to enjoy some student experiences, including field service experiences, interviews,

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:31.350
and reenactments from around the world.

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:36.909
One of the Gillied Instructors, Brother James Coffin, is going to take the lead in this

00:00:36.909 --> 00:00:39.469
part of the program.

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:43.670
And Brother Coffin has gotten to know you dear students quite well, it's been a lot of

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:49.869
time with you, so we know we're going to enjoy this part very much with a theme, the

00:00:49.869 --> 00:01:02.960
language of Canaan.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:10.760
Over the past five months, the Gillied students have discussed a number of Bible prophecies.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:16.200
One such prophecy is found in the book of Isaiah, chapter 19, verse 18.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.480
It reads like this.

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:23.280
In that day, there were proved to be five cities in the land of Egypt, speaking the language

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.159
of Canaan and swearing to Jehovah's armies.

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:31.439
The city of Taring down will one city be called.

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:38.480
This prophecy was initially fulfilled after the events of 607 BCE by the Jews who had

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.079
fled to Egypt.

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.920
They were speaking the Hebrew language in the cities of Egypt.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.120
Today there are people in the territory of modern-day Egypt who've learned to speak the

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.359
pure language of Bible truth.

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:58.719
One of the five figurative cities is called the city of Taring down, signifying that part

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:04.239
of the pure language is related to exposing and tearing down Satan's organization.

00:02:04.239 --> 00:02:09.000
Let us see how this Bible prophecy is being fulfilled today.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.840
Working with me as we give attention to GSBN, the Gillied School Broadcasting Network

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:43.319
for some worldwide reports.

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:48.120
Welcome to GSBN, Gillied School Broadcasting Network.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.560
Coming to you from Patterson Educational Center on Channel 140.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.840
We have an exciting program for you today focusing on the language of Canaan, the pure language

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.159
spoken by Jehovah's people.

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:06.400
We'll be traveling around the world revisiting experiences of the 140th class of Gilead.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.159
Our report will feature students witnessing in their home territories.

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:14.800
The challenge one couple faced when preparing to come to Gilead and the opportunity to witness

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.680
another couple had while traveling here.

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.400
We'll also feature an experience one of the students enjoyed right here in the local

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.360
territory in New York.

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.159
Well it sounds like a full program.

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:26.439
Where do we go first?

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:43.580
We start with our correspondent in Papua New Guinea.

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.180
This is Norma Hadu reporting from Papua New Guinea.

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.340
I am now at the local airport.

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.180
We are waiting for brother Joseph Stewart who is a circuit over seer who is on his way

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:53.780
to the next congregation.

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:59.060
He is invited to the 140th class of Gilead and we understand that he has some field experiences

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:00.939
to share with us.

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:07.479
And the plane just arrived and let's see if we can find him and ask some questions.

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:09.680
And okay.

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:10.680
And Joe.

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:11.680
Hello.

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:12.680
Hi Joe.

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:13.680
Hi.

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:14.680
Hi.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:15.680
I'm Norman from GSBN.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.279
We are so excited that you will be soon attending Gilead's school.

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:22.079
Do you have some field experiences to share with us?

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:23.079
Oh, experience.

00:04:23.079 --> 00:04:24.079
That's quite a lot.

00:04:24.079 --> 00:04:25.079
Or this one.

00:04:25.079 --> 00:04:28.920
We met a young man in the ministry who has a background in the truth.

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.319
He ended up in a gang.

00:04:30.519 --> 00:04:33.519
We invited him to the meeting and he did come.

00:04:33.519 --> 00:04:37.639
Later on I started Bible study with him and he progressed to the point where he could

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:39.920
enroll at the teacuristics school.

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.319
Did he face any challenges?

00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:46.720
Well, he's constantly started to bother him because he has escaped from a prison.

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.920
What escaped from prison?

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:51.120
And what did he do about his situation?

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.319
Well, first of all, I was stunned.

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:59.040
But both of us looked up the principal in Romans chapter 13, verse 1 to 7.

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:03.439
And he made his own decision that he has to turn himself over to the authorities.

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:04.439
Impressive.

00:05:04.439 --> 00:05:08.240
That shows the power of God's word and what happened next.

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:13.639
Because of his good behavior, they reduced his prison sentence and after he was released,

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:19.040
he made progress and also received his Bible study.

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:25.439
And in 2011, he got baptized and not long after that, he regularly applied.

00:05:25.439 --> 00:05:27.240
That's amazing progress.

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.240
Well, actually, no.

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:35.240
Now, he's a better light than saving in a first remote translation office here in Papua New Guinea.

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:36.240
That's so great.

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.240
And one last question, what did you learn from this situation?

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:43.240
Well, I learned that we should never give up on people.

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.240
I agree.

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:45.240
Thank you, Joe.

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.240
And we wish you Jehovah's blessing at Gillette.

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:48.240
My pleasure.

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.240
And you have a nice day.

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.240
That's so great to have so many experiences.

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.240
And this is Norman Pally, reporting from Papua New Guinea.

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:59.240
Now, we're going back to you at the studio.

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.939
Thank you for that report.

00:06:02.939 --> 00:06:08.949
What an excellent experience.

00:06:08.949 --> 00:06:13.949
It shows the power of the pure language to help people make big changes in their lives.

00:06:13.949 --> 00:06:14.949
That's true.

00:06:14.949 --> 00:06:21.949
One of our favorite segments here on GSBN is reports from public witnessing locations around the world.

00:06:21.949 --> 00:06:26.949
Today, we would like to welcome a guest into our studio, Brother Dirk Grunman.

00:06:26.949 --> 00:06:27.949
Welcome, Dirk.

00:06:27.949 --> 00:06:31.949
For our viewers, can you describe where you share in public witnessing?

00:06:31.949 --> 00:06:34.949
Thanks, Chad and Crystal Lee.

00:06:34.949 --> 00:06:39.949
The location is mine's Germany, where we regularly set up a public witnessing table.

00:06:39.949 --> 00:06:44.949
We understand that some publishers have learned a greeting in the languages of your territory.

00:06:44.949 --> 00:06:47.949
Have you had an opportunity to use those greetings?

00:06:47.949 --> 00:06:52.949
Yes, we have a nice experience and I brought a clip along that we can show to your viewers today.

00:06:52.949 --> 00:07:13.990
Well, let's take a look.

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:17.990
Dirk, did you see the gentleman sitting over there on the bench?

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:19.990
I wonder where he is from.

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:21.990
Maybe he's from Ghana.

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:23.990
Let me see if I can greet him in a tree.

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:28.420
What is he saying? Within the coffee, Brunei?

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:29.420
Hey, what a tree.

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:31.420
Know your partner also.

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:34.420
Oh, I'm sorry, sir. That's all the tree I know, but I'm happy to meet you.

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:35.420
Are you from Ghana?

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:36.420
Yes, I am.

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:38.420
And where did you learn your tree?

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:42.420
Some time ago, my wife and I attended a convention of Jehovah's Witnesses in your country.

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:44.420
How do you like Ghana?

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:50.420
It was very nice. We had a very nice time with our local friends there and really enjoyed it.

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:52.420
Have you talked to Jehovah's Witnesses before?

00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:56.420
I've seen them, but I've never really had a chance to talk to them.

00:07:56.420 --> 00:08:02.420
Well, actually, we enjoy talking to our neighbours about the good news of God's Kingdom.

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:06.420
How it will one day transform the whole earth into a paradise.

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:08.420
Oh, that is a nice picture.

00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:12.420
Actually, my wife and I are visiting Germany for a short time.

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:14.420
But we wouldn't mind worshipping with you.

00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:16.420
Where is your church?

00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:18.420
Maybe we can take a taxi and go there.

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:20.420
Oh, our Kingdom Hall.

00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:24.420
Well, actually, it's not too far from here, but we can also give you a ride.

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:25.420
Okay.

00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:27.420
Close my card.

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:29.420
I stay in the hotel near the train station.

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:31.420
That's my phone number.

00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:35.419
Okay, I will give you a call on Thursday afternoon and then we can pick you up in the evening.

00:08:35.419 --> 00:08:36.419
Okay, that will be fine.

00:08:36.419 --> 00:08:50.360
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:52.360
Thank you for bringing that clip.

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:56.360
It really shows the importance of being observant when we're involved in the public ministry.

00:08:56.360 --> 00:09:01.360
And how it touches people's hearts when we use a greeting in their language,

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:05.360
opening the way to be able to share the pure language with them.

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:07.360
Can you give us an update on that experience?

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:11.360
Yes, they came to our next meeting and were very well dressed.

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:15.360
In fact, some of the German brothers were suspecting they were visitors from Brooklyn.

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:21.360
But then we were surprised that all the local brothers from his country they actually knew him.

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:25.360
From television, because he had been a prominent politician.

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:30.360
He and his wife, they really enjoyed the program, the association, and especially our singing.

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:32.360
And we are still in touch with them.

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:38.360
Actually, it was that very same morning at our public witnessing table that we had another nice conversation.

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:41.360
And maybe we also want to watch the next clip.

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:58.559
Oh, yeah. Let's take a look.

00:09:58.559 --> 00:10:00.559
Hello. Do you speak English?

00:10:00.559 --> 00:10:02.559
Yes, I do. My name is Derk. Please to meet you.

00:10:02.559 --> 00:10:05.559
I'm Jacek. I am here as a student from Poland.

00:10:05.559 --> 00:10:08.559
My parents are Jehovah's Witnesses. But I'm not.

00:10:08.559 --> 00:10:10.559
They told me I should visit your headquarter.

00:10:10.559 --> 00:10:14.559
And I understand this somewhere in this area. Can you tell me where it is?

00:10:14.559 --> 00:10:17.559
Yes, actually my wife and I will live and work there.

00:10:17.559 --> 00:10:22.559
It's not far. And if you visit, you can come anytime from Monday to Friday.

00:10:22.559 --> 00:10:25.559
Let me give you our address and also our phone number.

00:10:25.559 --> 00:10:28.559
So that if you come by train, we can pick you up at the local station.

00:10:28.559 --> 00:10:31.559
Okay, good. I will contact you. Bye.

00:10:31.559 --> 00:10:38.529
So, Derk, can you tell us what happened next?

00:10:38.529 --> 00:10:41.529
Well, a few days later, you guessed it. The phone rang.

00:10:41.529 --> 00:10:45.529
And he and his girlfriend were there waiting for us at the train station.

00:10:45.529 --> 00:10:50.529
So they had a nice tour of Bessel and we still spend some time together to further their interest.

00:10:50.529 --> 00:10:54.529
Well, it sounds like because this family encouraged him to visit the branch,

00:10:54.529 --> 00:10:58.529
he was able to see the pure language and action among God's people.

00:10:58.529 --> 00:11:02.529
Thank you for coming into the studio today and sharing those experiences with us.

00:11:02.529 --> 00:11:16.549
Well, it's clear the students were hard at work in their home territories.

00:11:16.549 --> 00:11:20.549
And once they were invited to Gilead, things only got busier.

00:11:20.549 --> 00:11:22.549
The students did face some challenges.

00:11:22.549 --> 00:11:27.549
We ever report that was filed by a correspondent who visited Kyrgyzstan.

00:11:27.549 --> 00:11:33.549
It highlights Jehovah's Hand in helping one couple get the needed paperwork to be able to come to Gilead.

00:11:33.549 --> 00:11:37.730
Welcome to Kyrgyzstan.

00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:44.730
Before Class 140 of Gilead started, many of the students had concerns about whether they be able to obtain their visas.

00:11:45.730 --> 00:11:50.730
There was a major technical problem with the U.S. visa issuing system all around the world,

00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:53.730
and here in Bishkek, many have been unable to get visas.

00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:57.730
Brother and sister Jackie, I've made the situation a specific matter of prayer to Jehovah,

00:11:57.730 --> 00:12:00.730
and they asked others to pray on their behalf too.

00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:04.730
As part of the process, they had to have an interview at the U.S. Embassy.

00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:08.730
And when they checked, there was only one interview available for the whole of the week.

00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:11.730
How did they get on? Let's look in on reenactment.

00:12:20.789 --> 00:12:26.789
So, Jackie, if we are going to stay in the United States, in Paris and New York.

00:12:26.789 --> 00:12:27.789
And you too?

00:12:27.789 --> 00:12:28.789
Yes, I am.

00:12:28.789 --> 00:12:32.789
Okay. Gilead School. What is Gilead School?

00:12:32.789 --> 00:12:35.789
It is the school where I studied the Bible.

00:12:35.789 --> 00:12:38.789
Interesting. I've never received visas for such a school.

00:12:38.789 --> 00:12:41.789
Yes, we are first ones from Kyrgyzstan.

00:12:41.789 --> 00:12:46.789
Interesting. So, did Jehovah's Witnesses have an office in Kyrgyzstan?

00:12:46.789 --> 00:12:49.789
Yes, we have the branch office in Bishkek here.

00:12:49.789 --> 00:12:52.789
Okay. And what are you going to do after the school?

00:12:52.789 --> 00:12:55.789
We are going to come back to our branch office.

00:12:55.789 --> 00:12:58.789
Okay. And it's about six months.

00:12:58.789 --> 00:13:01.789
Yeah, it seems that everything is in order.

00:13:01.789 --> 00:13:05.789
So, your visas will be ready on Monday afternoon.

00:13:05.789 --> 00:13:10.190
Thank you.

00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:13.190
As you can imagine, Bulletin Chief felt a huge sense of relief

00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:18.190
when they received their visas in their hands as promised after a few days.

00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:23.190
Let's look in now and see what took place one week later when they went to boot their flight tickets.

00:13:23.190 --> 00:13:26.190
We would like to book tickets to the United States.

00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:30.190
Oh, United States. Do you have US visas?

00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:32.190
Yes, we have it.

00:13:32.190 --> 00:13:35.190
Really? When did you get it?

00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:37.190
We got last Monday.

00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:39.190
Last Monday? What?

00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:41.190
You are really fortunate.

00:13:41.190 --> 00:13:46.190
You know, since Tuesday, the US Embassy stopped issuing visas.

00:13:46.190 --> 00:13:47.190
Really?

00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:52.190
Even representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs were denied visas from that day on.

00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:55.190
Wow. Unbelievable.

00:13:55.190 --> 00:14:01.169
Okay, but when was it that you wanted to fly?

00:14:01.169 --> 00:14:07.169
Just to be clear for our viewers, what the Jacquefs hadn't realized was that just after they received the visas in their hands,

00:14:07.169 --> 00:14:09.169
there was an issue between the two countries,

00:14:09.169 --> 00:14:14.169
and the United States had refused to issue visas for anyone traveling from Kyrgyzstan.

00:14:14.169 --> 00:14:19.169
We could understand why the Jacquefs felt strongly that Jehovah God had answered their prayers.

00:14:19.169 --> 00:14:23.169
This is Andrew Luellen reporting for GSBN in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan.

00:14:23.169 --> 00:14:36.059
It looks like Brother Luellen is enjoying the culture.

00:14:36.059 --> 00:14:39.059
Yes, and that was one nice hat.

00:14:39.059 --> 00:14:41.059
I agree.

00:14:41.059 --> 00:14:44.059
We are so happy that Jacquefs made it to Gilead.

00:14:44.059 --> 00:14:47.059
Want to be wonderful when there are no more borders,

00:14:47.059 --> 00:14:50.059
and the world speaks the pure language.

00:14:50.059 --> 00:14:51.059
It sure will.

00:14:51.059 --> 00:14:56.059
Many of the students had long distances to travel to come to Gilead.

00:14:56.059 --> 00:15:01.059
When the Depalmas arrived from Romania, we had a correspondent there to welcome them.

00:15:01.059 --> 00:15:05.169
Let's go to his report.

00:15:05.169 --> 00:15:09.169
This is Yandy Argo reporting from JFK Airport, New York City.

00:15:09.169 --> 00:15:14.169
We've just got news that the Depalmas have arrived safely from Romania.

00:15:14.169 --> 00:15:17.169
We're hoping to catch up with them here at the airport,

00:15:17.169 --> 00:15:21.169
and welcome them as they arrive for the 140th class of Gilead.

00:15:21.169 --> 00:15:23.169
We know that they'll be arriving at Carousel number three,

00:15:23.169 --> 00:15:26.169
so we have to keep our eyes peeled for them.

00:15:26.169 --> 00:15:28.169
That looks like them there.

00:15:28.169 --> 00:15:30.169
He actually looks Italian.

00:15:30.169 --> 00:15:32.169
Brother Di Palma.

00:15:32.169 --> 00:15:33.169
Welcome.

00:15:33.169 --> 00:15:35.169
This is Yandy Argo reporting from GSBN.

00:15:35.169 --> 00:15:36.169
Welcome.

00:15:36.169 --> 00:15:37.169
Nice to have you here.

00:15:37.169 --> 00:15:39.169
How was your flight?

00:15:39.169 --> 00:15:40.169
How do you have a good trip?

00:15:40.169 --> 00:15:41.169
Thank you.

00:15:41.169 --> 00:15:42.169
Very nice.

00:15:42.169 --> 00:15:44.169
Yeah, we are excited to be here.

00:15:44.169 --> 00:15:50.169
We've already had a great experience while in transit at the airport in Amsterdam.

00:15:50.169 --> 00:15:51.169
That's fantastic.

00:15:51.169 --> 00:15:53.169
Please will you tell us about us?

00:15:53.169 --> 00:15:56.169
Yes, we met the lady Melina.

00:15:56.169 --> 00:15:58.169
She felt completely lost.

00:15:58.169 --> 00:16:00.169
She doesn't speak English,

00:16:00.169 --> 00:16:02.169
and she was reveling alone.

00:16:02.169 --> 00:16:04.169
And then what happened?

00:16:04.169 --> 00:16:09.169
Yes, we mentioned to her that we are Jehovah's Witnesses Unroot to attend the Bible School.

00:16:09.169 --> 00:16:14.169
And immediately she said, surely this is by God and that we met.

00:16:14.169 --> 00:16:17.899
That's fantastic.

00:16:17.899 --> 00:16:19.899
Wow, that's Melina.

00:16:19.899 --> 00:16:21.899
Yes, Melina.

00:16:21.899 --> 00:16:23.899
They are speaking Romanian now.

00:16:23.899 --> 00:16:26.899
Can you please tell us what she's saying?

00:16:26.899 --> 00:16:27.899
Yes, of course.

00:16:27.899 --> 00:16:30.899
She's saying, Claudia, thank you for your help.

00:16:30.899 --> 00:16:34.899
Now she gave to Claudia a note to their contact details.

00:16:34.899 --> 00:16:36.899
Excuse me.

00:16:36.899 --> 00:16:38.899
No problem.

00:16:38.899 --> 00:16:40.899
Maybe we can catch up with this story a little later.

00:16:40.899 --> 00:16:54.179
This is Yandy Argo reporting for GSBN New York City.

00:16:54.179 --> 00:16:56.179
Another nice experience.

00:16:56.179 --> 00:17:01.179
It shows that taking the initiative to provide practical help can often open opportunities

00:17:01.179 --> 00:17:03.179
for us to present a witness.

00:17:03.179 --> 00:17:06.180
The Gilead students all arrive safely.

00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:09.180
While focusing on their studies over the five months,

00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:12.180
they also had a meaningful share in the ministry.

00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:15.180
Brother and sister Tibido, who are here from the Marshall Islands,

00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:17.180
had a nice experience.

00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:20.180
Well, others from the car group were on a call.

00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:24.180
Sister Tibido took the opportunity to walk to a nearby business

00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:26.180
where used items are dropped off.

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:30.180
She spoke to a man who wanted to know why there are so many different religions.

00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:36.180
Brother and sister Tibido were actually able to return and answer the man's question.

00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:40.180
And we actually have a clip showing a reenactment of that call.

00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:46.029
So from what we've just read, why are there so many religions today?

00:17:46.029 --> 00:17:51.029
Well, as it says here, we're all created with spiritual need.

00:17:51.029 --> 00:17:53.029
Wow, it makes sense now to me.

00:17:53.029 --> 00:17:55.029
Oh, Hasan, that's wonderful.

00:17:55.029 --> 00:17:57.029
Now with so many different religions,

00:17:57.029 --> 00:18:01.029
do you think that all of them are worshiping God the way he wants them to?

00:18:01.029 --> 00:18:03.029
Hmm, I don't think so.

00:18:03.029 --> 00:18:07.029
There are many bad things, audible things being done in God's name.

00:18:07.029 --> 00:18:08.029
I don't think so.

00:18:08.029 --> 00:18:09.029
You're right.

00:18:09.029 --> 00:18:12.029
We agree with so many terrible things going on on the earth today.

00:18:12.029 --> 00:18:14.029
What do you think, Hasan?

00:18:14.029 --> 00:18:17.029
Don't you agree that we need some good news from God?

00:18:17.029 --> 00:18:18.029
Good news?

00:18:18.029 --> 00:18:20.029
I really want that.

00:18:20.029 --> 00:18:24.029
That's why we brought this brochure today entitled Good News from God.

00:18:24.029 --> 00:18:25.029
Oh, excuse me.

00:18:25.029 --> 00:18:26.029
Okay.

00:18:26.029 --> 00:18:28.029
Oh, my.

00:18:28.029 --> 00:18:29.029
Oh, yeah.

00:18:30.029 --> 00:18:32.029
He has a lot of stuff.

00:18:32.029 --> 00:18:33.029
Thank you.

00:18:33.029 --> 00:18:34.029
Man.

00:18:34.029 --> 00:18:36.029
Excuse me, sir.

00:18:36.029 --> 00:18:38.029
Would you like a text receipt for those items?

00:18:38.029 --> 00:18:39.029
Yeah, please.

00:18:39.029 --> 00:18:40.029
Okay.

00:18:40.029 --> 00:18:42.029
I have three bags with very nice clothing.

00:18:42.029 --> 00:18:43.029
Yes.

00:18:43.029 --> 00:18:46.029
And the little horse of my son.

00:18:46.029 --> 00:18:47.029
Okay.

00:18:47.029 --> 00:18:48.029
And the lamb of my mother.

00:18:48.029 --> 00:18:49.029
Good.

00:18:49.029 --> 00:18:50.029
Yeah. Thank you.

00:18:50.029 --> 00:18:51.029
Hello, sir.

00:18:51.029 --> 00:18:52.029
My name is Starlie.

00:18:52.029 --> 00:18:53.029
Mm-hmm.

00:18:53.029 --> 00:18:55.029
While you're waiting for your receipt, may I ask your opinion on something?

00:18:55.029 --> 00:18:56.029
Oh, yeah, sure.

00:18:56.029 --> 00:18:58.029
Which of these questions interests you the most?

00:18:58.029 --> 00:18:59.029
Let's see.

00:18:59.029 --> 00:19:01.029
What's the name of God?

00:19:01.029 --> 00:19:04.029
Get to help you have my life?

00:19:04.029 --> 00:19:07.029
Actually, all these questions sounds interesting to me.

00:19:07.029 --> 00:19:08.029
Can I have them all?

00:19:08.029 --> 00:19:10.029
Yes, of course you can.

00:19:10.029 --> 00:19:12.029
Enjoy finding the answers on the inside and you get home.

00:19:12.029 --> 00:19:13.029
Okay, thank you so much.

00:19:13.029 --> 00:19:14.029
Have a great day.

00:19:14.029 --> 00:19:15.029
Have a great day.

00:19:15.029 --> 00:19:16.029
Okay, thank you.

00:19:16.029 --> 00:19:17.029
See you next time, bye-bye.

00:19:17.029 --> 00:19:20.240
Thank you.

00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:22.240
So for next week, why don't you choose a question?

00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:25.240
And then when we return, we can discuss it together.

00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:27.240
Yeah, it sounds good to me.

00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:29.240
So see you next week.

00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:31.240
Okay, we'll see you next week, Hassan.

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:32.240
Thank you very much.

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:33.240
Bye-bye.

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:36.829
Bye-bye.

00:19:36.829 --> 00:19:51.589
Thank you.

00:19:51.589 --> 00:19:56.589
It's clear the pure language reaches the hearts of people of all religions and backgrounds.

00:19:56.589 --> 00:20:00.589
And good things come from making the best use of our time in the ministry.

00:20:00.589 --> 00:20:04.589
Yes, I understand that Tibidos continue to conduct a Bible study with that man.

00:20:04.589 --> 00:20:06.589
That's very good to hear.

00:20:06.589 --> 00:20:10.589
Before we wrap up today's program, we're going to the De Palmas room.

00:20:10.589 --> 00:20:14.589
They've agreed to take some time out of their busy schedule from studying

00:20:14.589 --> 00:20:19.589
to give us a little update on the experience that they had when they arrived at the airport.

00:20:19.589 --> 00:20:24.740
We would like to tell you what happened with Melina.

00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:27.740
She handed us a note with her email.

00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:31.740
We wrote back to her, but have received no reply.

00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:34.740
We finally decided to call her.

00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:40.740
And from the conversation, we realized that she sent us an email which we never received.

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:44.740
Yeah, she then sent us her original email.

00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:47.740
We can read what she wrote.

00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:49.740
Here Claudia and Antonio.

00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:53.740
I can't wait for your reply to my email.

00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:59.740
But if God sent you to me, I trust it and hope that you will write me someday.

00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:02.740
I want to thank you for your patience and your help.

00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:07.740
Thank you for all the beautiful things you wrote in your email.

00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:10.740
I have read in my Bible everything that you wrote.

00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:14.740
And I have watched the video on JW.org.

00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:17.740
It was very beautiful.

00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:21.740
I believe that as you said to me, the world will change one day.

00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:25.740
I thanks God every day for having met you.

00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:28.740
Thank you again for your help, Melina.

00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:32.740
We are so happy to receive her email.

00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:35.740
We'll continue to keep in touch.

00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:37.740
This was the update.

00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:40.740
Now as you can see, we have a lot to study.

00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:52.720
So, back to you in studio.

00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:54.720
That was a very touching letter.

00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:58.720
It's obvious there are many people yet to respond to the good news.

00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:02.720
You know, that was highlighted in all our experiences today.

00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:07.720
The pure language is reaching all over the earth and having a powerful effect on people's lives.

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:08.720
I agree.

00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:13.720
It was very encouraging to see the students working hard in their home territories.

00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:18.720
And also, Seja, who was hand in helping them make arrangements to come to Gilead.

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:25.720
And no doubt the training they received has helped them to be more determined to share the pure language at every opportunity.

00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:28.720
Well, that's it for our program.

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:31.720
And we would like to say thank you to our live studio audience.

00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:34.720
It was so nice to have you join us today.

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:42.720
And we also want to thank all the help that we received from our sister station, JW Broadcasting.

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:59.849
We're now going to hand our program over to our correspondent right here at Patterson.

00:22:59.849 --> 00:23:01.849
Over to you, brother Kothan.

00:23:01.849 --> 00:23:06.500
Thank you.

00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:16.930
For many years, the Balkans have experienced repeated conflicts fueled by ethnic nationalism.

00:23:16.930 --> 00:23:25.930
These ongoing conflicts have served Satan's purpose by fomenting deep-seated hatred among the population.

00:23:25.930 --> 00:23:30.930
How is the language of Canaan affecting this part of Satan's world?

00:23:30.930 --> 00:23:35.930
To answer that question, we'd like to interview three of our Gilead students.

00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:38.930
Sister Stretchkivik from Serbia.

00:23:38.930 --> 00:23:41.930
Brother Daguti from Albania.

00:23:41.930 --> 00:23:56.420
Brother Eliaski from Macedonia.

00:23:56.420 --> 00:23:59.420
Sister Stretchkivik, if we could start with you, please.

00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:03.420
What was the social and political climate growing up in your country?

00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:09.420
I was born and raised in Serbia, which at the time was part of former Yugoslavia.

00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:17.420
As young girl in early 80s, I remember watching news about Albanians in Kosovo protesting against the government.

00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:26.420
This protest created very negative attitude among Serbians against Albanians, but media made it even worse.

00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:29.420
They represented them as trouble makers.

00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:38.420
Over the years, there was more political turmoil, situation worsened, and in 1999, war broke out.

00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:47.420
My own nephew was forced to go to war, and I cannot imagine what he experienced there.

00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:50.420
But when he came back, he was never the same again.

00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:55.420
I see. Thank you. Brother Daguti, what about your situation, Gloria?

00:24:56.420 --> 00:25:00.420
Where I am from, in Kosovo, there is a strong feeling of nationalism.

00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:04.420
Everything in our upbringing started from our home.

00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:10.420
The music we listened to, our schooling, we are taught to you serve as our enemies.

00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:20.420
The situation got worse after the war started in 1999, so if you had a friend who is from Serbia, you would be considered a traitor.

00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:23.420
I see. Brother Eliaski, please.

00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:29.420
I was born and raised in Macedonia, which until 1990 was part of X Yugoslavia.

00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:37.420
And as Gordana mentioned, nationalism and the media caused the vision between people.

00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:41.420
But another factor is the religion.

00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:49.420
Due to historical circumstances, and that part of Europe's three religion fight for dominance.

00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:58.420
Therefore, it is not unusual in the same Balkan country, people that speak the same language to feel animosity toward each other.

00:25:58.420 --> 00:26:01.420
Why? Because they belong to different religions.

00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:03.420
I see. Thank you.

00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:08.420
Second question. How did this affect you as a young person?

00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:15.420
My family was not a jihua's witnesses, so I grew up believing everything I saw on the news.

00:26:15.420 --> 00:26:19.420
But that changed when I learned the truth in the 1988.

00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:21.420
I see. But the duty?

00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:25.420
This environment of strong nationalism really affected me.

00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:28.420
I was 15 when the war started in Kosovo.

00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:33.420
And later working for the government, you naturally were expected to be nationalistic.

00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:41.420
So even though Albanians and the Soviets lived close to each other, it was a big wall of nationalism between us.

00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:43.420
Yes. Brother Eliaski.

00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:48.420
In the past, I had a desire to be an officer in the army.

00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:53.420
Therefore, in 1995, I started with military school.

00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:56.420
I graduated in the middle of 1999.

00:26:56.420 --> 00:27:00.420
And immediately after that, I started to work as an officer in the Macedonia army.

00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:05.420
That same year, 1999, the war started in Kosovo.

00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:10.420
And that caused tensions in nearby Macedonia.

00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:13.420
That very same year, also, I started to study the Bible.

00:27:13.420 --> 00:27:18.420
I see. Now, brother Deguti, if I could start with you for this question.

00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:22.420
How did the language of Canaan change your thinking?

00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:25.420
Well, the change was not immediate.

00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:30.420
Outside the congregation, it was a burning nationalism and hatred towards Serbs.

00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:34.420
Then I go to the congregation and I see a different world.

00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:38.420
Albanians calling Serbians brothers and sisters.

00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:41.420
Hugging them and warmly welcoming them in the meetings.

00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:44.420
I could not believe my eyes. How could that be?

00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:47.420
But then, knowing the truth, knowing Jehovah's viewpoint,

00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:52.420
what does the true love mean and accepting others as Jehovah accept them?

00:27:52.420 --> 00:27:57.420
So it affected my thinking and later my feelings.

00:27:57.420 --> 00:28:03.420
I wanted to be like others in the congregation, not to show any prejudice or partiality.

00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:08.420
So, for example, in our congregation, we had two old Serbian sisters

00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:10.420
living in an isolated area.

00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:15.420
And in the congregation, we had a program to pick them up and to bring in the meetings.

00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:17.420
So I offered myself to do that.

00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:22.420
I remember the first time when I drove into that isolated area

00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:25.420
and I get close to the house of two sisters.

00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:29.420
They saw me and they went out from their home and shouted,

00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:36.420
my brother, my brother, in that moment I was proud to be part of Jehovah's United family.

00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:40.420
It was a wall of nationalism just broke down.

00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:45.420
And I never thought and imagined that one day I will do that.

00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:48.420
But only Holy Spirit can triumph over nationalism.

00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:52.420
Yes. Good. Thank you. Sister, a stretch of which please.

00:28:52.420 --> 00:28:54.420
The truth has brought in my horizon.

00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:58.420
It has helped me not to judge people based on their nationality,

00:28:58.420 --> 00:29:02.420
not to generalize and not to have prejudice.

00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:07.420
In the ministry, I see everyone as a potential servant of Jehovah.

00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:11.420
And in the congregation, I enjoy association with various people

00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:16.420
and I am very happy to have friends from different nations and lands.

00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:21.420
Actually, today, my graduation guests are from four different countries

00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:25.420
from Serbia, Croatia, Bosnia and from United States.

00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:29.420
Thank you. Brother Lieski, please.

00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:34.420
After learning the truth, my faith grew stronger.

00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:39.420
And in 2001, I left the army and become an publisher.

00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:45.420
And that was just months or two before the conflict between ethnic Macedonians

00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:48.420
and ethnic Albanians started in Macedonia.

00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:54.420
Looking back for that time, I am convinced that Jehovah protected me

00:29:54.420 --> 00:29:59.420
and might conscious because I never even try to kill someone,

00:29:59.420 --> 00:30:03.420
although that was part of my training.

00:30:03.420 --> 00:30:05.420
Also, I want to share another experience.

00:30:05.420 --> 00:30:10.420
In 2008, our branch organized special preaching campaign

00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:14.420
in which publishers from several European countries were invited

00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:18.420
to Macedonia with a goal to preach on unassigned territories.

00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:22.420
Together with some of them, we went in an area that was, in fact,

00:30:22.420 --> 00:30:24.420
a former military zone.

00:30:24.420 --> 00:30:29.420
In one village, we met a man that participated in a war in Kosovo,

00:30:29.420 --> 00:30:32.420
South Serbia and in Macedonia.

00:30:32.420 --> 00:30:36.420
He was nervous, but after that, the conversation went normal,

00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:43.420
but also he was very surprised how come Macedonian came to his village

00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:45.420
to talk to him.

00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:48.420
In a pass, I would fight against him,

00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:51.420
but now I have opportunity to give witness to him.

00:30:51.420 --> 00:30:54.420
Thank you. Excellent.

00:30:54.420 --> 00:30:55.420
One last question.

00:30:55.420 --> 00:31:00.420
How has a pure language of truth been a unifying force in your life?

00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:02.420
Please.

00:31:02.420 --> 00:31:06.420
Being part of Jehovah's organization is unique and amazing.

00:31:06.420 --> 00:31:09.420
There are no borders for Jehovah's spirit.

00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:14.420
We all share the common goal to do Jehovah's will and to preach the good news.

00:31:14.420 --> 00:31:19.420
People in the world hardly ever have friends in other nations they had

00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:22.420
or have conflict with.

00:31:22.420 --> 00:31:27.420
It is strange for them how we all can be together in unity.

00:31:27.420 --> 00:31:31.420
But here I enjoy being with a wonderful battle family

00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:36.420
and in the class 48 people from 29 different countries.

00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:41.420
I see them all not just as my friends, but as my own family.

00:31:42.420 --> 00:31:48.420
And this is something I will be proud to share in my ministry and with my relatives back home.

00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:51.420
Thank you. Beautiful expression. Brother Degerti, please.

00:31:51.420 --> 00:31:55.420
Even though people in our region were fighting and hating each other

00:31:55.420 --> 00:32:00.420
at the branch in Albania we had a choir project that brought brothers and sisters

00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:07.420
from Serbia, Macedonia, Bulgaria, Croatia, Bosnia to sing prizes for Jehovah.

00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:14.420
And it was amazing to see this beautiful family united singing together, dancing together

00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:16.420
and working together in the ministry.

00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:18.420
It was like a new world.

00:32:18.420 --> 00:32:23.420
And I want to mention just an experience one day I was in the ministry with a Serbian brother

00:32:23.420 --> 00:32:27.420
and we met an Albanian man and he said, where are you from?

00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:31.420
I said, I'm from Albanian from Kosovo and my partner is from Serbia.

00:32:31.420 --> 00:32:34.420
He said, why are you together? How could that be?

00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:39.420
No, it's not possible. When I said we are Jehovah's witnesses, he said,

00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:42.420
now I understand why you are together.

00:32:42.420 --> 00:32:47.420
So even people outside the world that are not Jehovah's witnesses can see

00:32:47.420 --> 00:32:50.420
and recognize the unity that we have as Jehovah's people.

00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:53.420
And thank you for sharing Brother Lijski.

00:32:53.420 --> 00:33:00.420
Our branch has organized several language courses among them Albanian as well.

00:33:00.420 --> 00:33:06.420
And that really helps to reach the heart of different people living in Macedonia with a bio-message.

00:33:06.420 --> 00:33:10.420
Another unified factor are the missionaries from different countries.

00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:17.420
And that is really proof to me that we are one unified organization.

00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:24.420
Coming here at this school as Petrit and Gordana mentioned is unique experience also for me.

00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:34.420
Not our classmates are from different countries, but also being here in Patterson with much more people from different background.

00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:40.420
That proved to me that we are one huge unified organization.

00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:48.420
And after this, I am even more convinced that if we cherish Bible principles and apply them in our lives,

00:33:48.420 --> 00:33:52.420
we can maintain a good relationship with others.

00:33:52.420 --> 00:33:54.420
Very nice, thank you.

00:33:54.420 --> 00:33:57.420
Isaiah 1918 concludes by saying,

00:33:57.420 --> 00:34:01.420
one city will be called the city of tearing down.

00:34:01.420 --> 00:34:04.420
As we've seen, the language of Canaan,

00:34:04.420 --> 00:34:07.420
that is the pure language of Bible truth,

00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:35.719
is successfully tearing down walls of division in Satan's world.

00:34:35.719 --> 00:34:37.719
Well, thank you very much, Brother.

00:34:38.719 --> 00:34:49.719
You've given the governing body some good ideas for future broadcasts of your sister station.

00:34:49.719 --> 00:34:54.480
But now we're going to get to enjoy another fine treat.

00:34:54.480 --> 00:35:00.480
We're going to get to enjoy an interview of two of our gillied instructors,

00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:05.480
Brother William Samuelson and Kenneth Stovall.

00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:10.480
Now, Brother William Malinfont, a helper to the teaching committee,

00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:17.480
will conduct this interview with the theme, Training Ministers of the Kingdom.

00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:27.300
As you all know, the blessings that have resulted from gillied school span the globe.

00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:31.300
Training of ministers of the kingdom.

00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:35.300
And the blessings are more numerous than we can count.

00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:42.300
But on this occasion, we have two instructors with us, Bill Samuelson and Ken Stovall.

00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:45.300
And we'll learn a little bit more about the operation of gillied school

00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:49.300
and some of the interesting things that take place behind the scenes at times.

00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:52.300
First of all, Bill, a question for you.

00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:56.300
Why were you brought into Patterson Bethel back in 1998?

00:35:56.300 --> 00:36:00.300
Well, divine education was moving forward.

00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:04.300
They were getting ready to start the school for traveling overseers.

00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:08.300
The branch committee members was also in operation.

00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:11.300
And I was brought in to work with those schools.

00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:16.300
Okay, but when you came in, Ken, you were already serving for some time

00:36:16.300 --> 00:36:18.300
with the gillied school operation.

00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:21.300
Tell us a little bit about the work that you had to do.

00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:22.300
Oh, yes.

00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:27.300
November of 2015 was 25 years.

00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:31.300
So I'm in my 26th year of working with the schools department.

00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:40.300
So that's a quarter of a century, 42% of my life, 78% of my Bethel career.

00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:43.300
He's a statistician, you know.

00:36:43.300 --> 00:36:44.300
Yes.

00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:50.300
Some of the things I've done over the years is scheduling classes, instructors,

00:36:50.300 --> 00:36:55.300
printing class materials needed for the students.

00:36:55.300 --> 00:36:59.300
Working with visas, of course, in the past we had students that went to four assignments.

00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:01.300
Now most of the students go back to their assignments.

00:37:01.300 --> 00:37:04.300
So we had to help them get into their countries of assignment.

00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:09.300
But now we have more students actually coming from countries outside the United States.

00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:13.300
So we have a lot of work to do with helping them get visas to get into the United States.

00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:18.300
And then in the last few years I've done instructing in gillied and the other schools,

00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:20.300
that theocratic schools deals with.

00:37:20.300 --> 00:37:21.300
Very good, Ken.

00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:22.300
Thank you very much.

00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:27.300
So you began your Bethel career in 1998 when you came to Patterson Bethel, correct?

00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:29.300
Well, no, not exactly.

00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:34.300
Well, I started when I was a little younger back in 1955.

00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:36.300
I was at least four.

00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:43.300
Well, what was your assignment back in 1955?

00:37:43.300 --> 00:37:46.300
I was assigned to WBBR.

00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:51.300
We had a radio station and we had a farm and a cannery.

00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:55.300
I worked on the farm and the cannery and after there for a short time,

00:37:55.300 --> 00:37:58.300
did a little bit of work on the station as some.

00:37:58.300 --> 00:38:04.300
Who else was there at Staten Island at the time when you were called in as a young Bethelite?

00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:08.300
Well, I was able to find one picture that might help us.

00:38:08.300 --> 00:38:15.300
This is the sign leading up to WBBR, not quite as up to date as it could be today.

00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:20.300
But the brother on the right is Brother Fred Franz, sister, one of the Kenning sisters.

00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:25.300
Margie Benson, Yugi and myself on the left.

00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:30.300
But the friends had a studio out there or a study better said he did all of his work out there

00:38:30.300 --> 00:38:33.300
for the writing department at that time.

00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:39.300
But now this was back in 1955 when you started your career Ken, where were you in 1955?

00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:40.300
Do you want to see a picture?

00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:42.300
Yes, please.

00:38:42.300 --> 00:38:44.300
Wait a minute, it's coming.

00:38:44.300 --> 00:38:47.300
There I am.

00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:51.300
You got Bethel written all over your face on that, didn't you?

00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:52.300
Very good.

00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:57.300
Now getting back to you, Bill, what was the Bethel arrangement like at Staten Island,

00:38:57.300 --> 00:39:00.300
the house, et cetera, the property?

00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:06.300
Well, the sign we saw with the three of us there behind that was a long driveway

00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:09.300
with a beautiful hedge on both sides.

00:39:09.300 --> 00:39:12.300
It may have a picture of that.

00:39:12.300 --> 00:39:17.300
And from there behind that, and if we don't, that's okay, there it is,

00:39:17.300 --> 00:39:21.300
had to trim that with hand trimmers.

00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:23.300
We didn't have electric yet.

00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:30.300
But at the top, but the very top is the house and studio for BBR.

00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:35.300
The house to the left, the big house is where we had all of our Bethel people living.

00:39:35.300 --> 00:39:39.300
And the one to the right was the studio and the transmitter building.

00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:41.300
That's remarkable.

00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:44.300
That garden is there at Staten Island, didn't you?

00:39:44.300 --> 00:39:48.300
You worked in the field in order to supply food for Brooklyn Bethel.

00:39:48.300 --> 00:39:51.300
But there was a brother, an older brother who worked with you there.

00:39:51.300 --> 00:39:53.300
He had a saying that was very interesting, Bill.

00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:54.300
Tell us about it.

00:39:54.300 --> 00:39:59.300
We actually had seven acres under irrigation, overhead oscillators that took care of that.

00:39:59.300 --> 00:40:02.300
And we had brother Elden Woodworth.

00:40:02.300 --> 00:40:04.300
He had been at Bethel for a number of years.

00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:07.300
His wife had some health problems.

00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:11.300
For quite some time she was hospitalized, she was just been released.

00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:16.300
And he was transferred from Brooklyn, or she loved, to Staten Island.

00:40:16.300 --> 00:40:20.300
And now he finds himself digging in the mud with the rest of us young guys.

00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:22.300
And of course, he was a lot older.

00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:24.300
But you know how young brothers are?

00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:26.300
They start complaining once in a while.

00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:29.300
Not that any of our Bethelites would ever do that.

00:40:29.300 --> 00:40:33.300
But he always, he would listen about as long as he could.

00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:35.300
And then he had that expression.

00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:42.300
He'd say, it sure is marvelous what the Lord has done with what he's got to work with.

00:40:42.300 --> 00:40:47.300
I think that's something we could apply right now, too.

00:40:47.300 --> 00:40:52.300
Bill, why do you have such fond memories, though, of the Canary at Staten Island?

00:40:52.300 --> 00:40:54.300
There has to be a reason for that.

00:40:54.300 --> 00:40:57.300
Well, let me show you another picture.

00:40:57.300 --> 00:41:02.030
This one was taken about a year later.

00:41:02.030 --> 00:41:05.030
The brother on the left is Ralph Leffler.

00:41:05.030 --> 00:41:08.030
He was our chief engineer at the station.

00:41:08.030 --> 00:41:17.030
That's Angie Romano-Samuelson next to him, myself, and then a sister, Etta Houth.

00:41:17.030 --> 00:41:20.030
Now, Etta had responsibility for the canning.

00:41:20.030 --> 00:41:23.030
She looked after the formulas and the cooking and all of that.

00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:25.030
I worked in the boiler room.

00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:29.030
But Etta helped Angie into the truth.

00:41:29.030 --> 00:41:32.030
She was the one that really took her under her wing.

00:41:33.030 --> 00:41:35.030
Sort of became a spiritual mother.

00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:38.030
I've always maintained that it takes two to make a marriage.

00:41:38.030 --> 00:41:41.030
Anxious daughter and a desperate mother.

00:41:41.030 --> 00:41:45.030
Apparently, in this case, it worked.

00:41:45.030 --> 00:41:46.030
Very good.

00:41:46.030 --> 00:41:49.030
Now, when you and Angie got married, then you left Staten Island,

00:41:49.030 --> 00:41:55.030
and you had a number of assignments that helped prepare you for your role as an instructor.

00:41:55.030 --> 00:42:00.030
Can you give us just a brief summary of your activities after you left Staten Island?

00:42:00.030 --> 00:42:06.030
Well, as you remember, you couldn't get married and stay at Bethel at that time.

00:42:06.030 --> 00:42:11.030
If you got married, unless you'd been there ten years and your wife for some such thing.

00:42:11.030 --> 00:42:13.030
So, we pioneered on Staten Island.

00:42:13.030 --> 00:42:15.030
I continued to work at BBR.

00:42:15.030 --> 00:42:20.030
Only now it was WPLW, the people that bought it from the society.

00:42:20.030 --> 00:42:22.030
About three years.

00:42:22.030 --> 00:42:25.030
And we got assigned into special pioneer work.

00:42:25.030 --> 00:42:29.030
From there, we got invited to the month's Kingdom Ministry School up at South Lansing.

00:42:29.030 --> 00:42:31.030
Kingdom Farm.

00:42:31.030 --> 00:42:35.030
And from there, we got assigned into missionary work in Cambodia.

00:42:35.030 --> 00:42:37.030
We were there for a short time.

00:42:37.030 --> 00:42:39.030
Political situation was not good.

00:42:39.030 --> 00:42:45.030
And we ended up in Vietnam, and then we ended up returning to the States.

00:42:45.030 --> 00:42:50.030
After getting things squared away physically and otherwise here,

00:42:50.030 --> 00:42:53.030
we were put in circuit work in 1965.

00:42:54.030 --> 00:42:59.030
We served then for 33 years, 22 in circuit 11 in district.

00:42:59.030 --> 00:43:05.030
No, I remember when you used to be convention overseer in the New York City area and when you were on the road.

00:43:05.030 --> 00:43:13.030
Now, back to you Ken, why is Gilead School more than just an academic course,

00:43:13.030 --> 00:43:17.030
a matter of acquiring knowledge, book knowledge?

00:43:18.030 --> 00:43:24.030
Yeah, the curriculum is not designed just to help students memorize a lot of facts.

00:43:24.030 --> 00:43:27.030
It's designed to build their faith.

00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:36.030
You know, at Luke 247, when Jesus, as 12 years old, was being questioned by the instructors at the temple,

00:43:36.030 --> 00:43:38.030
they were amazed.

00:43:38.030 --> 00:43:40.030
But it's interesting what they were amazed at.

00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:47.030
Jesus was citing a lot of the law that he had memorized or a lot of facts.

00:43:47.030 --> 00:43:50.030
It says they were amazed at his understanding.

00:43:50.030 --> 00:43:54.030
So he understood what was underneath the law, the principles.

00:43:54.030 --> 00:44:01.030
He understood the author of the law and why the law was the way it was and what Jehovah was thinking.

00:44:01.030 --> 00:44:06.030
And really, that's the goal of Gilead is to help the students with the knowledge,

00:44:06.030 --> 00:44:10.030
to get closer to Jehovah, to understand him better.

00:44:10.030 --> 00:44:15.030
And then when they do that, they can love Jehovah better and they can have more faith in him.

00:44:15.030 --> 00:44:20.030
And with that strength and faith, they can face whatever they need to.

00:44:20.030 --> 00:44:27.030
Very good. And Bill and Ken, you can answer that both of you can give us a comment on this question.

00:44:27.030 --> 00:44:33.030
When you first see students come into Gilead and then the time of graduation comes,

00:44:33.030 --> 00:44:41.030
are you able to detect certain changes in the students themselves because of the schooling they received? Bill?

00:44:41.030 --> 00:44:51.030
Surely, they come in now, the students are already in special full-time service, spiritually mature, solid.

00:44:51.030 --> 00:44:55.030
As a result, you may not expect to see quite as much.

00:44:55.030 --> 00:45:04.030
It just received an email from a student this morning that was assigned into the field in Asian country.

00:45:04.030 --> 00:45:10.030
And they're just overjoyed. They say that every day, they were 23 years in full-time service before they came.

00:45:10.030 --> 00:45:16.030
And every day, they think about what they learned at Gilead. It strengthens them.

00:45:16.030 --> 00:45:21.030
They come, they're spiritually mature and they leave even more so.

00:45:21.030 --> 00:45:30.030
Very good. And Ken, you have some interesting thoughts and comments about reviews the students have taken tests and observations also?

00:45:30.030 --> 00:45:40.030
Yeah, it's true. Like Bill said, we get correspondence from the students where they express appreciation, which speaks to your question about how do they change?

00:45:40.030 --> 00:45:46.030
For example, here's one, recent one. And this is what they said.

00:45:46.030 --> 00:45:56.030
We would like to express our deepest appreciation for the precious education we received at Gilead and the unforgettable lessons you lovingly shared with us.

00:45:56.030 --> 00:46:01.030
Thank you so much for the time you spent preparing our minds and hearts for our assignment.

00:46:01.030 --> 00:46:05.030
Not a day passes by that we do not think about something we learned at Gilead.

00:46:05.030 --> 00:46:15.030
In fact, when we encountered an unusual situation or a need to make a decision, the first thought that comes to our minds is what we learned at Gilead that would apply.

00:46:15.030 --> 00:46:22.030
And we really feel that it is helping us to develop a new pattern of action and reaction.

00:46:22.030 --> 00:46:27.030
So the students are affected and we see that.

00:46:27.030 --> 00:46:33.030
Something that I've noticed that is a change in the students.

00:46:33.030 --> 00:46:38.030
And it almost seems like a contradiction, but it's not really.

00:46:38.030 --> 00:46:45.030
But here's what it is. They come in and go out with more humility.

00:46:45.030 --> 00:46:48.030
Now humility, not because they're beaten down.

00:46:48.030 --> 00:46:53.030
In the world, they think to make someone more humble, you have to slap him around and beat him down.

00:46:53.030 --> 00:47:03.030
But in fact, they are more humble because of the humble examples they see around them and the kind way they're treated. And it humbles them.

00:47:03.030 --> 00:47:10.030
But the contradiction, or what seems to be the contradiction, is they also leave with more confidence.

00:47:10.030 --> 00:47:14.030
Now you might wonder, how can they be more humble but have more confidence?

00:47:14.030 --> 00:47:18.030
Well, it's not excessive self-confidence.

00:47:18.030 --> 00:47:32.030
But it's confidence in the fact that if they apply Bible standards, if they do things Jehovah's way, they see that for sure they will be able to be successful in the assignments they're given.

00:47:32.030 --> 00:47:37.030
So at the same time as having more humility, they actually do have more confidence.

00:47:37.030 --> 00:47:42.030
That's an interesting observation, Ken. And Bill, back to you now.

00:47:42.030 --> 00:47:53.030
What has Gilead School, the entire course, served as respects other schools, a foundation for other schools that we have operating?

00:47:53.030 --> 00:48:02.030
Well, the last three years that I was in traveling work before coming to Bethel to the Paterson, I taught the ministerial training school.

00:48:02.030 --> 00:48:08.030
And I got familiar with the curriculum, but I had no idea of the basis.

00:48:08.030 --> 00:48:20.030
When I got here and got involved with Gilead, I come to find out all of our schools really, back then MTS today, SKE, and all of the ones in between,

00:48:20.030 --> 00:48:25.030
are school for the congregation elders.

00:48:25.030 --> 00:48:29.030
The foundation is the material that we teach at Gilead.

00:48:29.030 --> 00:48:34.030
That is solid spiritual material, not the technical end of things.

00:48:34.030 --> 00:48:39.030
But the spiritual instruction is based solidly on the Bible.

00:48:39.030 --> 00:48:44.030
And so all of our other schools really benefit from the curriculum of Gilead.

00:48:44.030 --> 00:48:51.030
That's fine. And Ken, you made a comment earlier about seeing a miracle every day.

00:48:51.030 --> 00:48:53.030
Can you tell us what that means?

00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:57.030
Yeah, sure. Did you want to discuss the written exercises?

00:48:57.030 --> 00:48:58.030
Well, you can do that, too.

00:48:58.030 --> 00:49:03.030
Yes, if you would like to catch us up on this interview, that's fine.

00:49:03.030 --> 00:49:11.539
Well, we had mentioned that the students take written exercises. We don't call them tests.

00:49:11.539 --> 00:49:18.539
But it is interesting to see some of their answers. Over the years, I've graded some of those tests, and it can be tedious.

00:49:18.539 --> 00:49:24.539
But also the reward is that there's sometimes some funny answers that come up on those written exercises.

00:49:24.539 --> 00:49:28.539
That happens also because of foreign language, and they're dealing with the English language.

00:49:28.539 --> 00:49:31.539
But go ahead, give us a couple of examples.

00:49:31.539 --> 00:49:38.300
So we chuckle respectfully when we read those answers.

00:49:38.300 --> 00:49:47.300
For example, here was one. The question was based on Leviticus 1626 about the goat for a zeal.

00:49:47.300 --> 00:49:59.300
What does it mean? And the student meant to write scapegoat, but they transposed the sea and the pea, and what they actually wrote was space goat.

00:49:59.300 --> 00:50:07.750
Did you grade the student on that error? Did you give him credit?

00:50:07.750 --> 00:50:12.750
We just wrote a little note and gave him credit.

00:50:12.750 --> 00:50:20.750
Another one. What are the three aids to manifesting a long suffering or patience?

00:50:20.750 --> 00:50:28.750
What we were looking for were things like humility, prayer, unselfish love, and the student put two of those.

00:50:28.750 --> 00:50:51.110
But the very first, their number one answer, their first answer on what would aid them to have patience was marriage.

00:50:51.110 --> 00:50:57.110
I'm not going to ask you how you graded that student.

00:50:57.110 --> 00:51:05.840
Well, it was a single brother. And my question was, how did he know?

00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:08.840
Very good.

00:51:08.840 --> 00:51:14.840
So one other was regarding, it was about theocratic history.

00:51:14.840 --> 00:51:20.840
And the question was, how were congregation elders first selected?

00:51:20.840 --> 00:51:29.840
And the answer was the student put by vote by those fully desecrated in the congregation.

00:51:29.840 --> 00:51:32.840
And I'm pretty sure they meant to put.

00:51:32.840 --> 00:51:40.840
This, everyone who learns another language knows what it's like to make some very interesting mistakes.

00:51:40.840 --> 00:51:44.840
But you would ask about the miracle.

00:51:44.840 --> 00:51:52.840
One of the things that really, or the thing that I most love about working with Gilead, is working with students.

00:51:52.840 --> 00:51:59.840
It's just an amazing privilege. And that's because, as we've seen earlier in the program,

00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:07.840
that our worldwide brotherhood is, in fact, not illustratively, but really is a miracle.

00:52:07.840 --> 00:52:15.840
And the insight book defines miracle as an occurrence that excites wonder or astonishment,

00:52:15.840 --> 00:52:20.840
effects in the physical world that surpass all human or natural powers,

00:52:20.840 --> 00:52:24.840
and are therefore attributed to supernatural agency.

00:52:25.840 --> 00:52:33.840
The fact is, there is no human power on earth that could establish and maintain the worldwide brotherhood we have.

00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:36.840
It has to be Jehovah's spirit.

00:52:36.840 --> 00:52:38.840
And so it is a miracle.

00:52:38.840 --> 00:52:45.840
And so when I go into class and talk to the students, and I hear them express their faith,

00:52:45.840 --> 00:52:51.840
and they're from all around the world, and their faith is exactly like mine, I'm experiencing a miracle.

00:52:51.840 --> 00:52:56.840
So every day of my life, I first hand get to see a miracle, and it's such a privilege.

00:52:56.840 --> 00:52:58.840
It's a wonderful privilege working with Gilead.

00:52:58.840 --> 00:53:02.840
Very, very good observation, Ken, and the love they have among themselves,

00:53:02.840 --> 00:53:05.840
although from so many different lands.

00:53:05.840 --> 00:53:11.840
Will Bill, you're getting to a certain point in life that I won't go into great detail on,

00:53:11.840 --> 00:53:14.840
but maybe you have a final observation for us.

00:53:14.840 --> 00:53:23.840
Well, as I think most are aware, when you turn 80, you generally have a change of assignment here at Bethel.

00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:29.840
And a week ago, I turned 80, and now as was introduced earlier in the program,

00:53:29.840 --> 00:53:33.840
Brother Mark Numer is the overseer of the department.

00:53:33.840 --> 00:53:36.840
The department was formed in 2007.

00:53:36.840 --> 00:53:41.840
I've had the privilege of serving as the overseer since that time for the last nine years.

00:53:41.840 --> 00:53:43.840
It's been a real joy.

00:53:43.840 --> 00:53:48.840
I've enjoyed working with all of the instructors, just excellent men.

00:53:48.840 --> 00:53:52.840
And especially with Mark, he's been extremely helpful.

00:53:52.840 --> 00:53:58.840
I've worked with him a little longer than just the seven years, going back a little further than that.

00:53:58.840 --> 00:54:04.840
But he's been an outstanding instructor as was evident in the talk he just gave.

00:54:04.840 --> 00:54:09.840
And the students admire him, and we're going to enjoy working together

00:54:09.840 --> 00:54:16.840
as we see the Theocratic schools department continue to accomplish his work.

00:54:16.840 --> 00:54:17.840
Yes, indeed.

00:54:17.840 --> 00:54:21.840
And can I think you had one other observation you wanted to make about Bill?

00:54:21.840 --> 00:54:24.840
Working with Brother Samuelson has been a great pleasure.

00:54:24.840 --> 00:54:27.840
He has been a marvelous overseer.

00:54:27.840 --> 00:54:34.840
He is organized, has a plan of action to get work accomplished, but he's a reasonable.

00:54:35.840 --> 00:54:42.840
He has always dealt with everyone with dignity, and it's been a real pleasure to work with Brother Samuelson.

00:54:42.840 --> 00:54:44.840
And also, he's an excellent student of the Bible.

00:54:44.840 --> 00:54:51.840
If I have questions on the Bible, I'll go to Bill, and he will tell me not only the way we currently think about it,

00:54:51.840 --> 00:54:55.840
but a history of how our thinking developed.

00:54:55.840 --> 00:54:57.840
So he's been a wonderful overseer.

00:54:57.840 --> 00:54:59.840
Well, I think it's very nice.

00:54:59.840 --> 00:55:05.840
You're placing a degree of praise upon your fellow worker, Bill Samuelson.

00:55:05.840 --> 00:55:12.840
After all, I'm a firm believer that older men who are teachers and who speak in the congregation are worthy of double honor.

00:55:12.840 --> 00:55:16.840
So thank you very much, Bill and Ken.

00:55:16.840 --> 00:55:51.980
Well, it's obvious you enjoyed very much that delightful, that informative interview.

00:55:51.980 --> 00:55:54.980
And by the way, we appreciate that hearty laughter.

00:55:54.980 --> 00:55:59.539
We got a good massage of the heart.

00:55:59.539 --> 00:56:02.539
But that was very enjoyable.

00:56:02.539 --> 00:56:05.539
Well, we're going to get to stand now and sing a song together.

00:56:05.539 --> 00:56:08.539
We have another one of our new songs.

00:56:08.539 --> 00:56:11.539
Grant us boldness.

00:56:11.539 --> 00:56:13.539
Song number 137.
