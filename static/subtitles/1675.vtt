00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:06.099
But what if it's been many years since you served Jehovah?

00:00:06.099 --> 00:00:09.259
Does Jehovah still care for you?

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:13.380
The following interview will help you answer that question.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:19.739
It's the story of Manfred Stephensdorfer, a brother in Germany who was separated from

00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:23.579
Jehovah's organization for many years.

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:29.059
How did Jehovah show his personal care for brother Stephensdorfer?

00:00:29.059 --> 00:00:34.670
And how did he respond?

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:45.259
One day early in the morning, I had a kind of heart attack.

00:00:45.259 --> 00:00:54.149
And because it didn't stop, I went to the hospital.

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:01.899
When I arrived there, then the heart calmed down.

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:08.780
So I sat there in the car and started to think about my life.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.379
I was not really happy.

00:01:11.379 --> 00:01:15.900
There was an emptiness in my heart.

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:18.180
I was racing the truth.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.379
My parents got baptized when I was two and my brother five years old.

00:01:23.379 --> 00:01:29.180
But eight years later, when I was ten, they became inactive.

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.060
For almost one year, I went alone to the meetings.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.219
A young brother and his wife, they really took care of me.

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:39.780
He took me along in field service.

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.980
He gave me little assignments, let me read at the book study, which impressed me a lot,

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:49.260
and also participated in the Theorocratic Ministry school.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:54.659
But then a few months later, we moved to another town far away from any kingdom hall.

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.700
So I didn't have any chance to attend the meetings anymore.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.900
For the next ten years, because of school and sports,

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.579
and later also because of my demanding work,

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:11.780
I was so busy that I was completely distracted from the truth.

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:18.740
But deep in my heart, I knew there is Jehovah and there is the truth.

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:23.539
And my conscience reminded me from time to time.

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:28.900
But nothing happened until that very morning when I sat in the car

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:34.340
and started to think about my life.

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.900
I started to pray the very first time after many years,

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.539
the long prayer and I poured out all my feelings to Jehovah.

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:52.030
And I asked him to help me to return, because I knew it would not be that easy.

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.349
Well, a few days later, while I was waiting for somebody,

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:58.509
a girl sat beside me.

00:02:58.509 --> 00:03:03.229
And I asked her right away whether she believes in God.

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:09.229
A very interesting discussion started, and she said that she was a strong catholic.

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:12.669
And she was also searching for the truth,

00:03:12.669 --> 00:03:15.870
because she was not happy with what happened in her religion.

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.750
We continued our conversations.

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:25.710
We decided to examine both together religion and to start with Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:30.270
A few weeks later, we looked in a newspaper for an address of a kingdom hall.

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:35.469
And we went there, but we had to leave earlier because of my health condition,

00:03:35.469 --> 00:03:39.870
so there was no contact to the congregation to any of these brothers.

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.870
In the meantime, we got married, and not long after we got married,

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.069
the sister came to our door from house to house.

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:50.590
I wasn't at home. My wife took the truth book,

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.870
and asked her whether she would be willing to return the next day,

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:55.310
because then I would be home.

00:03:56.509 --> 00:04:01.550
When I came back in the evening, I was so happy when I heard what had happened.

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:05.229
So I took the truth book, studied to read,

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:08.669
and I didn't end until the book was finished.

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.139
And everything that I learned as a child came back.

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.050
The next day, the sister came, we started the Bible study.

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:24.209
At the weekend, we attended a circuit assembly,

00:04:24.209 --> 00:04:26.370
and the week after we attended the meeting.

00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:32.689
The brothers were so friendly and welcomed us in such a way

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:36.209
that I really felt as if I had returned home.

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:42.610
So we were so enthused that we right away went to my parents.

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:45.810
We right away went to my brother at the same time,

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:47.810
so he was married in the meantime.

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:51.410
He had a child, and I studied the Bible study with him.

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:57.410
I also went to an uncle of mine, and I heard that he also was a witness in the 1950s.

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:02.209
So we invited him to accompany us to the convention in Nuremberg.

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:07.410
He agreed, we took him along, and we came then there at the assembly ground.

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:13.170
And then I also went to the brother who cared for me when I was a child,

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:16.449
because I heard that he also was inactive.

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:19.250
So we told them what has happened to us,

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:23.889
and how much he influenced my life when he cared for me as a child.

00:05:24.769 --> 00:05:29.569
And you can imagine what joy we had when they all returned to Jehovah.

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:36.370
At the same time, I decided together with my wife not to say no to Jehovah,

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:42.050
to say yes whenever it would be possible, we became also very active in field service.

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:46.209
So in the month when I was baptized, I awk zero pioneers.

00:05:46.209 --> 00:05:50.370
Eight months after baptism, I started regular pioneering.

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:53.490
My wife started also some time later.

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:57.089
When we were asked to special pioneer, we said yes.

00:05:57.649 --> 00:06:03.009
When we were asked to assist with engineering construction here at this new construction in

00:06:03.009 --> 00:06:06.370
Zeltas, we also agreed. We said yes to it.

00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:12.129
Some years later, when we were asked to stay at Bethel, as Bethelites, we also agreed to it.

00:06:12.129 --> 00:06:13.569
We also said yes.

00:06:14.689 --> 00:06:18.610
Because of all the blessings we experienced from the very beginning,

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:25.009
we got the strength and we got the joy to put in practice what we were determined to do.

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:29.329
So that means it was an outstanding joy as you can imagine

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:35.970
when all those relatives came back to the truth and returned to Jehovah.

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:40.769
It was a joy that many of the studies we had in all these years, they finally

00:06:41.569 --> 00:06:43.569
many of them, they got baptized.

00:06:48.399 --> 00:06:53.040
But one of the outstanding blessings was that I got to know my wife.

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:58.399
She really helped me a lot to return to Jehovah.

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:05.120
And she always gave a wonderful example and was very jealous in field service up to this day.

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:24.079
I personally experienced how merciful Jehovah was to me and to my wife

00:07:24.079 --> 00:07:27.839
that he is really full of tender affection.

00:07:29.439 --> 00:07:39.120
When I returned to him, then he returned to me in a faith strengthening way.

00:07:46.319 --> 00:07:52.160
What a blessing brother Stephensdorfer had not only to be reactivated himself,

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:53.839
but to reactivate others.

00:07:54.639 --> 00:08:00.000
Brother Stephensdorfer kept his word about always saying yes to Jehovah.

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:12.240
In fact, he now serves as a member of the Branch Committee in Central Europe.
