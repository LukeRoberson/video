00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:08.060
Jesus as the great teacher created opportunities to witness to others.

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:13.060
And of course, an excellent example of that is found in John chapter 4.

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:16.059
So if you turn with me please to John chapter 4,

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:22.059
let's analyze how Jesus was able to do in formal witnessing.

00:00:22.059 --> 00:00:25.059
And we'll see what lessons we can learn from it.

00:00:25.059 --> 00:00:31.059
So looking at John chapter 4 to get the background we see in verses 3 through 6,

00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:37.060
he mentions that Jesus left Judea and he was going towards Galilee.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:43.060
But he decided to go through Samaria and ended up in Psyca.

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:52.060
Looking at the study note, we notice that this was a journey that involved an ascent of some 3000 feet.

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:57.060
Now that's a very high elevation to climb up to.

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:05.060
In rough terms we could say it's like going up 300 floors or stories in a building.

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.060
Imagine how you would feel at the end of that.

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.060
So if Jesus and His apostles had made that journey that morning,

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.060
it's no wonder that in verse 6 it says that He was tired out.

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:22.060
He was sitting there and it mentions in verse 6 to it was the 6th hour or about midday.

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:30.060
So imagine the setting Jesus is in Samaria, he's tired and it's about midday.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.060
Not the best circumstances for starting to witness.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.060
So what's the first lesson we learned from this?

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:43.060
Jesus didn't wait for the perfect opportunity to inform a witness.

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.060
Now he used whatever opportunity came up and created opportunities.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:55.060
So of course the woman comes along and notice in verse 7 how Jesus introduced or started this conversation.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.060
He simply said, give me a drink.

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:06.060
He didn't dive into some deep spiritual discussion, but rather just started talking to the woman.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.060
For what lesson do we learn from that?

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.060
You see if we're interested in witnessing to others informally,

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.060
perhaps all it takes is just greeting them, saying hello,

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.060
and of course if they're not even willing to start talking to us,

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.060
it's very hard to go much further.

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.060
So that's the first lesson.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.060
How did the woman respond?

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.060
Well, we'll notice as we go through John chapter 4,

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:38.060
there were at least four potential problems that Jesus had to avoid as He continued this discussion.

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.060
The first of these problems is recorded in verse 9.

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.060
This straight away she says,

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.060
you're a Jew and I'm a Samaritan woman.

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.060
How come you're talking to me?

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.060
So she referred to his appearance, his background.

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.060
Well, in a similar way today, sometimes someone may take a look at us

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:03.060
and refer to our color or racial background or nationality,

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.060
and that could be a negative thing.

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.060
But what did Jesus say?

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.060
Well, He didn't respond and say, you know, I'm a nice person.

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.060
That's how come I'm willing to talk to you.

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.060
Now, He completely avoided that whole issue

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:26.060
and focused on the spiritual message that He wanted to convey to her.

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.060
So we notice that in verse 10,

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.060
He speaks of the free gift of God.

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:38.060
And He also mentions that this woman could get living water,

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.060
not just the water that she was interested in at that point.

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.060
Now, when we analyze how the conversation went,

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:51.060
we can see clearly that Jesus laid the foundation here at this point

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.060
for what He was going to say later.

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.060
You see, He started with water,

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.060
then He mentions God's gifts and living water,

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.060
and we'll see how He develops that little further as we go on.

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:08.060
Well, what happened at that point when He offered this living water?

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:13.060
Well, in verse 11, notice, she says, you don't even have a bucket.

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:18.060
So in other words, she was basically saying, I don't believe you.

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.060
The well is very deep.

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:24.060
The study note says maybe about 75 foot deep.

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.060
So this is a negative reaction on her part.

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:33.060
She wrote up by something else that was very controversial in Jesus' day.

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:39.060
She says, do you think you're better than our forefather Jacob?

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.060
Now, that was very controversial because the average Jew in those days

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:49.060
would have objected to that comment saying that she wasn't a relative of Jacob.

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:53.060
So here we have another two possible problems.

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.060
How did Jesus handle it?

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:59.060
Jesus focused back on the spiritual message.

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:04.060
As we mentioned, as recorded in verse 10, He started with water,

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:09.060
God's gift and living water, and then if we look at verse 14,

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:14.060
He speaks about drinking water that you would never get thirsty at all again,

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:20.060
and then He introduces the concept or thought of everlasting life.

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:25.060
Jesus had in his mind a plan of action or a little outline

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:28.060
how he could develop a certain theme.

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:33.060
And that was to do with water leading to everlasting life.

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:36.060
Well, how did the woman respond at that point?

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:40.060
Notice verse 15, she says, sir, give me this water.

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:44.060
Now, was she saying, please, I really want it?

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:48.060
Or was she perhaps a little cynical, maybe even a little psychastic?

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.060
Well, it's hard for us to tell.

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:54.060
It doesn't seem until later that she fully believed Jesus.

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:58.060
But whatever the case, it perhaps could, in a modern setting,

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:04.060
be like her saying, that sounds good, but it's too good to be true.

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:07.060
Did that stop Jesus? No.

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:12.060
Jesus then basically changes the direction of the conversation

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:17.060
and gives her an opportunity to show her honesty.

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:21.060
Jesus realized that she was coming at that time of the day

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:25.060
to avoid perhaps others seeing her. Why?

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:29.060
Well, in verse 16, Jesus says to recall your husband.

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:32.060
She says, I don't have a husband.

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:34.060
Very honest comment to a stranger.

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:37.060
Then Jesus said, you're right.

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:42.060
You had five husbands, and the man you're with now is not your husband.

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:45.060
You have said truthfully.

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:48.060
Well, now what do we learn from this?

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:54.060
You see, although Jesus knew that she was living in an immoral relationship,

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:57.060
still, that wasn't the focus.

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:01.060
He gave her an opportunity to express herself, and then what did he do?

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:03.060
He commended her.

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:08.060
So in a similar way, it's good for us to always try to find points that we can

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:14.060
commend the persons for, even if they say something that is totally opposite to what the Bible says.

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:20.060
We can at least thank them for expressing their viewpoint and being honest about it.

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:24.060
So as we continue on, we then see at this point,

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:30.060
the woman has really taken notice because she says, I see that you're a prophet.

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:34.060
But then the next problem, the fourth problem comes in.

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:39.060
What does she say? Well, we worship here, Mount Gerasim,

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:43.060
but you Jews, you say we should worship in Jerusalem.

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:49.060
So basically, a modern equivalent of saying, I have my own religion, and it's different from yours.

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:54.060
Well, how did Jesus deal with that potential problem?

00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:59.060
But when we look at verse 21, it's interesting to see how he starts the answer

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:04.060
by saying, the hour is coming when, neither on this mountain,

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:07.060
nor in Jerusalem, will you worship the Father.

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:13.060
So basically, Jesus was just allowing her concern and saying, look, don't worry, in the future.

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:17.060
This is not going to be an issue, whether it's here or there.

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:25.060
And then he goes on to explain the important thing is to worship the Father with spirit and truth.

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:27.060
So what do we see from that?

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:34.059
Jesus tried to help her to see that what she perceived as being a problem really wasn't an issue at all.

00:08:35.059 --> 00:08:40.059
It wasn't something they had to go through and explain all the details.

00:08:40.059 --> 00:08:44.059
Of course, he did mention that salvation began with the Jews,

00:08:44.059 --> 00:08:49.059
but then he showed her very clearly what she needed to do.

00:08:49.059 --> 00:08:52.059
Now, why was that so important?

00:08:52.059 --> 00:08:58.059
Well, if we turn later to the book of Acts chapter 8 and verse 14,

00:08:58.059 --> 00:09:02.059
there's a very interesting study note there that tells us

00:09:02.059 --> 00:09:09.059
that what Jesus did on this occasion in witnessing to this woman and then to various ones in her community

00:09:09.059 --> 00:09:16.059
laid the basis for what Philip, the evangelizer, would later do when he moved to Samaria

00:09:16.059 --> 00:09:19.059
and he would help many there to become Christians.

00:09:19.059 --> 00:09:23.059
And ultimately, they became anointed Christians.

00:09:23.059 --> 00:09:29.059
So Jesus' conversation here with this woman certainly was very, very successful.

00:09:30.059 --> 00:09:34.059
So what have we learned from this discussion looking through John chapter 4?

00:09:34.059 --> 00:09:38.059
First of all, Jesus didn't wait for the perfect opportunity.

00:09:38.059 --> 00:09:40.059
He created that opportunity.

00:09:40.059 --> 00:09:47.059
Secondly, he wasn't distracted or sidetracked by the various issues, some of them conversial,

00:09:47.059 --> 00:09:52.059
that this woman raised, but he focused on a spiritual theme.

00:09:52.059 --> 00:09:58.059
He had something in mind where he would use water to eventually describe everlasting life.

00:09:58.059 --> 00:10:05.059
And then he commended her for her honest remarks and showed her what she needed to do.

00:10:05.059 --> 00:10:11.059
What an excellent lesson this is for all of us as we try to witness to others.
