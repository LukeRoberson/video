00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:26.460
Thousands of commuters in New York are noting a pronounced presence of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.980
In sharp contrast with demonstrations, protests, and stage sit-ins recently held here and in

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.820
other major cities, Jehovah's Witnesses are setting up quiet, multi-lingual showcases

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.700
of their Bible literature, islands of free Bible education for those who choose to take

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:42.700
a closer look.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:50.270
We bring these cards out in the morning from usually an AM to recharge.

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:55.429
There's just been an amazing tremendous response and it shows that people really are interested

00:00:55.429 --> 00:00:57.270
in what the Bible has to say.

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.350
The Witnesses report that in the first few months of using these displays in Manhattan,

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:08.790
those approaching the displays obtain nearly 32,000 books and over 13,000 magazines in various

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:09.790
languages.

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:10.790
I think it's good.

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:11.790
I really do.

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.549
I'm a conservative Christian myself, so anytime you can spread the word to multiple people,

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:18.790
that's a good thing.

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.829
In addition to Times Square, the Witnesses are also trying the new approach here in Grand

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:28.269
Central Terminal, where according to an official website, over 750,000 people pass through

00:01:28.269 --> 00:01:32.549
each day and over 21 million tourists visit each year.

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:33.790
I think it's a good approach.

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.950
I mean, usually if you have an eye-catching sign that sometimes people at least look over

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.230
and see what it is.

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:46.430
I can't say that I've ever stopped, but it's interesting if you're trying to get the

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:47.430
news out about something.

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.109
I've seen them here in other places as well.

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:53.909
I think it's important that people know there's a choice, and if they feel so inclined,

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.629
then it's here for them to take away with them.

00:01:55.629 --> 00:01:56.629
I think it's fine.

00:01:56.629 --> 00:01:57.629
Why not?

00:01:57.629 --> 00:01:58.629
You know?

00:01:58.629 --> 00:02:01.430
I think that's what Bible literature is all about.

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:08.069
It's free of charge, spread the word, get it to the people, and make yourself available.

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.830
None of the Witnesses we spoke with view this new approach as a replacement of the regular

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:12.830
door-to-door ministry.

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.509
However, the displays of free Bible literature continue to be successful, and the Witnesses

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:20.469
are now trying this approach in other major cities as well.
