00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:06.360
Our team met brother Boniface Kwamla in the Volta region of Ghana.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:11.359
From infancy, he was surrounded by superstitious beliefs and practices.

00:00:11.359 --> 00:00:14.359
What did he find that transformed his life

00:00:14.359 --> 00:00:19.410
and caused him to take a courageous stand?

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.410
At the tender age, I have a troubled mind

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.750
as to how I would be pleasing to God

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.750
and also at the same time be pleasing in the eyes of the voodoo.

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:39.439
Two of my siblings died before I was born.

00:00:39.439 --> 00:00:43.439
So my mother was seeking protection

00:00:43.439 --> 00:00:46.439
or through her pregnancy.

00:00:46.439 --> 00:00:52.719
With me, my mother was made to believe that

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:57.719
when she goes to the production regularly,

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.719
she will be protected from the witches.

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:05.719
This means she has to walk about four miles

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:10.719
to the shrine regularly bare-footed.

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:13.719
After my bed, I was sent to the voodoo

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:17.719
trying to be protected from the attack of the witches.

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:20.719
I was kept there.

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:24.719
I got baptized into the Catholic church.

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:28.719
There we were taught that those who worship idols,

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:33.719
the voodoo who would be bent in an everlasting hellfire.

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:35.719
I was terrified.

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:42.450
I knew that God's name is Jehovah.

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.450
I had a name Jehovah's Witnesses

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.450
and it appealed to me so it kept on ringing in my ears.

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.450
Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.450
Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:01.879
One day, relatives we were discussing religion

00:02:01.879 --> 00:02:04.879
and they called us.

00:02:04.879 --> 00:02:06.879
But I said,

00:02:06.879 --> 00:02:08.879
if I join any church at all,

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:13.949
it would be Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:16.949
One day, I asked my father,

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:20.949
would the priest be angry if he knows that

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:24.949
after going for the communion,

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:27.949
still going to the shrine?

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:29.949
My father came back

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:32.949
with the news bags.

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:34.949
The priest said,

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:36.949
I can still go ahead

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:38.949
being an idol worshiper

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:42.949
and at the same time being a Catholic.

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:46.810
I became disturbed.

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.689
I became confused.

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:54.689
I came across Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:58.689
When I was of age and left the village,

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:01.689
I bombarded them with questions.

00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:06.479
I became very furious.

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:08.479
When they told me,

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:10.479
Easter, Christmas, New Year celebration,

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:12.479
even the cross we used

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:14.479
were of pagan origin.

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:17.479
So I demanded a book.

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:20.479
I read that book

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:22.479
before they break.

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:24.479
So that night, in my heart,

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:26.479
I broke away from the voodoo worship

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:30.479
and also from the Catholic religion.

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.330
I was afraid to confront my father

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.330
over the issue.

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:40.330
In our culture,

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.330
it's not easy for a young man

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:49.719
to take such a crucial decision.

00:03:49.719 --> 00:03:51.719
Before I could be aware,

00:03:51.719 --> 00:03:53.719
there was the news in the village

00:03:53.719 --> 00:03:55.719
that now don't go as

00:03:55.719 --> 00:03:57.719
during the new religion.

00:03:57.719 --> 00:03:59.719
So anytime I go home,

00:03:59.719 --> 00:04:01.719
relatives will knock on my door.

00:04:01.719 --> 00:04:04.719
I don't want to advise me

00:04:04.719 --> 00:04:07.719
on seeing my decision.

00:04:07.719 --> 00:04:10.719
My worry was how to

00:04:10.719 --> 00:04:17.899
inform my father.

00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:21.629
And one day,

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:25.420
my father invited me

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:28.420
and then inquired of me

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:32.420
of what was really happening.

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:41.420
And it became a very strong confrontation.

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:42.420
I told him,

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:44.420
I worship Jehovah.

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:46.420
Jehovah is the only God

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:48.420
so he fled up,

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:49.420
left me,

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:51.420
and then went into this room.

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:53.420
So I also entered my room

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:55.420
and started singing.

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:56.420
Once with confusion,

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:58.420
our side has waived

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:04.420
drinking the Catholic religion distilled.

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:06.420
I was singing so vigorously.

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:08.420
I see somebody who has been

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:10.420
liberated because

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:13.420
initially I was in prison.

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:19.389
But now I am a freed man.

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:20.389
So since then,

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:23.389
I've been serving Jehovah.

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:34.009
The fear of man has been overcome.

00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:36.009
I am no longer a captive

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:38.009
of the fear of death,

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:40.009
or even the dead.

00:05:40.009 --> 00:05:43.009
I no longer engage myself

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:45.009
in any practices

00:05:45.009 --> 00:05:48.009
that contrary to Bible standards.

00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:54.939
I feel liberated.

00:05:54.939 --> 00:05:55.939
It makes me happy

00:05:55.939 --> 00:05:57.939
when I see my children

00:05:57.939 --> 00:06:00.939
also serving the only true God

00:06:00.939 --> 00:06:01.939
Jehovah.

00:06:01.939 --> 00:06:07.480
And now I live a very happy family life.

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:28.319
Brother Kwamla

00:06:28.319 --> 00:06:30.319
had a desire to know God.

00:06:30.319 --> 00:06:32.319
But as we saw,

00:06:32.319 --> 00:06:33.319
something was missing.

00:06:33.319 --> 00:06:34.319
Without help,

00:06:34.319 --> 00:06:36.319
how could he incline his heart

00:06:36.319 --> 00:06:37.319
to discernment?

00:06:37.319 --> 00:06:40.319
Only when he received the truth book

00:06:40.319 --> 00:06:41.319
as a young man that he

00:06:41.319 --> 00:06:42.319
had spiritual food

00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:44.319
to study God's Word?

00:06:44.319 --> 00:06:45.319
At last,

00:06:45.319 --> 00:06:47.319
he was able to understand God's

00:06:47.319 --> 00:06:49.319
saying instead of false religions.

00:06:49.319 --> 00:06:52.319
He was baptized in 1976.
