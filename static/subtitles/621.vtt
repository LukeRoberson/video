00:00:02.189 --> 00:00:06.190
Have you ever received a change of assignment?

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:09.189
I'm sure all of us have.

00:00:09.189 --> 00:00:15.189
But how did you react each time that you received a change of assignment?

00:00:15.189 --> 00:00:19.190
Well, if we brutally honest, we probably would have to admit

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:26.190
our reaction was perhaps not always the same and maybe not as good each time.

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:31.190
For example, in 1978, when I received the letter from the governing body

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:35.189
assigning me as a missionary to the South Pacific,

00:00:35.189 --> 00:00:39.189
I was sad to leave behind my friends and relatives,

00:00:39.189 --> 00:00:41.189
but I was so excited.

00:00:41.189 --> 00:00:47.189
I was looking forward to this new door of opportunity to be a missionary in the South Pacific.

00:00:47.189 --> 00:00:51.189
And through the years, I had a number of assignment changes.

00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:56.189
But one that stands out in my mind is in 2003.

00:00:56.189 --> 00:01:00.189
That's when I received another very short letter from the governing body

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:05.189
telling me that I was going to be permanently assigned to New York.

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.189
My reaction?

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:09.189
A little different this time.

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:13.189
I was shocked, dismayed, overwhelmed.

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:15.189
In fact, even horrified.

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:16.189
Why?

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:20.189
Because I thought I knew where your hover wanted me to be.

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.189
And I certainly didn't expect this change of assignment.

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:31.189
And additionally, I was never had on my wish list working in America.

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:34.189
So with those thoughts running through my mind,

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:38.189
I found for about three days I could hardly speak to anyone.

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.189
I was found sitting on a chair just staring into space,

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:45.189
blank look on my face.

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:51.189
Well, what can we do when we have a reaction like that to a change of assignment?

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:55.189
Well, there are a few things we'd like to discuss with you this morning.

00:01:55.189 --> 00:02:02.189
The first one is remember what you have promised your hover to do.

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.189
And that's a very important thing to remember.

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:10.189
In the case of our Lord Jesus Christ, when He was to be baptized,

00:02:10.189 --> 00:02:13.189
we remember Hebrews chapter 10 tells us,

00:02:13.189 --> 00:02:16.189
He prayed, look, I have come to do your will.

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:21.189
So He was eager, He was ready, He wanted to do Jehovah's will.

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:26.189
But now let's think of the situation just before His death.

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:30.189
He was praying earnestly, and He asked for this cup to be removed,

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:35.189
the cup meaning the shameful death as a criminal.

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:37.189
That could perhaps dishonor Jehovah's name.

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:41.189
But then what did Jesus say at the end of that prayer?

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:46.189
Yet not as I will, but as you will.

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:49.189
So Jesus remembered what He promised,

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:53.189
and He remembered Jehovah's will as the prime thing.

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:58.189
Now in my case, after being stunned for a few days,

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:02.189
someone very close to me said something very powerful, they said,

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:07.189
well, we know it's very hard for you, Jeff, because you love the Pacific.

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:10.189
But we know you loved Jehovah more.

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:15.189
That's exactly the reminder that I needed at that time.

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:21.189
The second thing that can help us is to allow for some time.

00:03:21.189 --> 00:03:26.189
Don't just react immediately, but perhaps take a few days off.

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:29.189
If it's a large change of assignment,

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:36.189
take that time to quietly pray to Jehovah to meditate on the Scriptures.

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:39.189
Now again, if we think of the example of our Lord Jesus,

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:42.189
after He was baptized, what did He do?

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:46.189
He went for 40 days after His baptism into the wilderness.

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:50.189
And there, no doubt, He meditated on all the many things

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:55.189
that have been downloaded to His mind about His previous experiences

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:59.189
and also thinking about what He would face in the future.

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:04.189
Yes, He took the time to pray and meditate about this change of assignment,

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:11.189
even though perhaps He had already spent thousands of years preparing for this assignment.

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:14.189
Also, the apostle Paul did something similar.

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:18.189
We're remembering Galatians 1 after his conversion.

00:04:18.189 --> 00:04:21.189
It says that he went into Arabia for a little while,

00:04:21.189 --> 00:04:25.189
and the study note on Galatians 1, 17, tells us

00:04:25.189 --> 00:04:30.189
that perhaps he used that quiet time to meditate on the Scriptures

00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:35.189
and adjust his viewpoint with regard to the application of those Scriptures.

00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:39.189
So what can we do if we just have a little bit of time by ourselves

00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:44.189
once we've received the notification of a change of assignment?

00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:49.189
Well, one thing could be to reflect the attitude of King David

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:53.189
as expressed in Psalm 51 and verse 10.

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:55.189
Let's read that together.

00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:58.189
There, the Psalmist David said,

00:04:58.189 --> 00:05:01.189
create in me a pure heart of God

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:07.189
and put within me a new spirit, a steadfast one.

00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:12.189
Yes, if we're starting to feel negative with regard to a change of assignment,

00:05:12.189 --> 00:05:17.189
why not pray specifically to Jehovah to grant us a willing spirit

00:05:17.189 --> 00:05:21.189
or as Philippians 2 verse 13 says,

00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:27.189
to give us the desire and the power to act in accepting this new assignment.

00:05:27.189 --> 00:05:30.189
And of course, Philippians 4, 6, and 7 says,

00:05:30.189 --> 00:05:34.189
that Jehovah can grant us that peace of God

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:38.189
that will protect our heart and our mental powers.

00:05:38.189 --> 00:05:42.189
What's the third thing that we need to keep in mind?

00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:48.189
Don't view this change of assignment as a demotion.

00:05:48.189 --> 00:05:51.189
Let's think again of our Lord Jesus Christ.

00:05:51.189 --> 00:05:56.189
Philippians 2 tells us that he was in a very high position,

00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:59.189
the second highest position in the whole universe,

00:05:59.189 --> 00:06:05.189
together with his father, but he was willing to come down lower than the angels

00:06:05.189 --> 00:06:10.189
and then even lower than the authority of his fleshly parents.

00:06:10.189 --> 00:06:12.189
He had to obey them.

00:06:12.189 --> 00:06:14.189
But now here's the question.

00:06:14.189 --> 00:06:20.189
At that point in time was Jesus more valuable to Jehovah or less valuable.

00:06:20.189 --> 00:06:25.189
Of course, he was more valuable even though he had a lowly position.

00:06:25.189 --> 00:06:33.189
So in a similar way, we need to realize that privileges are not the measure of our personal worth.

00:06:33.189 --> 00:06:39.189
So that helps us not to view any reassignment or change of assignment

00:06:39.189 --> 00:06:42.189
as being a demotion.

00:06:42.189 --> 00:06:47.189
The fourth point to keep in mind is when we're thinking about this new assignment,

00:06:47.189 --> 00:06:53.189
look for the advantages and don't just focus on the disadvantages.

00:06:53.189 --> 00:06:57.189
Let's think about the example of the Apostle Paul.

00:06:57.189 --> 00:07:05.189
We remember that he had a very high status in the society of the Jewish people back in his day

00:07:05.189 --> 00:07:08.189
as a Pharisee well-educated.

00:07:08.189 --> 00:07:12.189
And then after his conversion, he was hated by people.

00:07:12.189 --> 00:07:14.189
He lost the social status.

00:07:14.189 --> 00:07:17.189
He had to endure all sorts of difficulties.

00:07:17.189 --> 00:07:20.189
But what was Paul's attitude?

00:07:20.189 --> 00:07:25.189
Well, turn with me please to Philippians chapter 2,

00:07:25.189 --> 00:07:29.189
sorry, Philippians chapter 4, and verse 11.

00:07:29.189 --> 00:07:33.189
And notice at the end of verse 11, he says,

00:07:33.189 --> 00:07:39.189
for I have learned to be self-sufficient regardless of my circumstances.

00:07:39.189 --> 00:07:45.189
Whereas one translation says, I have become independent of my circumstances.

00:07:45.189 --> 00:07:54.189
So in other words, my circumstances don't dictate my joy and my relationship with Jehovah.

00:07:54.189 --> 00:08:00.189
What a beautiful thought. And notice how he expresses this in verses 12 and 13.

00:08:00.189 --> 00:08:05.189
I know how to be low on provisions and how to have an abundance.

00:08:05.189 --> 00:08:14.189
In everything and in all circumstances, I have learned the secret of how to be full and how to hunger,

00:08:14.189 --> 00:08:18.189
both how to have an abundance and how to do without.

00:08:18.189 --> 00:08:20.189
And this is the key point.

00:08:20.189 --> 00:08:26.189
For all things I have the strength for the one who gives me power.

00:08:26.189 --> 00:08:31.189
So Paul was able to learn to rely fully upon Jehovah.

00:08:31.189 --> 00:08:37.190
And he realized no matter what circumstance he had or what a Simon he was given,

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:40.190
there would be advantages and disadvantages.

00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:44.190
Now I'm sure none of us have found the perfect assignment, have we?

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:48.190
Every assignment has some good things and some negative things about it.

00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:53.190
So keeping that in mind helps us to focus on the positive things,

00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:57.190
the advantages of a new assignment.

00:08:57.190 --> 00:09:02.190
And finally, let's remember the examples of others.

00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:08.190
Perhaps modern day examples, persons we know who have adapted to change of assignment.

00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:12.190
What we might even think of one such as Abraham and Sarah.

00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:19.190
Remember how they had to leave their home and live in tents for a long period of time.

00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:23.190
But Hebrews chapter 6, verse 15 says,

00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:28.190
After Abraham had showed patience, he obtained his promise.

00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:31.190
Yes, what a beautiful reminder.

00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:37.190
And as Hebrews tells us with regard to this type of person, Hebrews 11, 15,

00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:42.190
and yet if they had kept remembering the place from which they had departed,

00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:46.190
they would have had an opportunity to return.

00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:52.190
So if we face a new assignment, how can we react?

00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:56.190
Well, remember if we keep in mind what we promised Jehovah,

00:09:56.190 --> 00:10:00.190
our relationship with him, that we would do whatever he asks,

00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:05.190
if we allow time to get our minds around the assignment and pray about it,

00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:09.190
if we don't view it as a demotion, if we look through the advantages,

00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:14.190
and we remember the example of others, then certainly we can say to Jehovah,

00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:16.190
here am I, send me.
