00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:23.039
I embarrassed my wife tonight.

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:46.579
I knew when it happened, and I didn't want to talk about it, but I knew in my heart

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:52.979
that Yumi was right.

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:56.420
I had become unkind.

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:02.609
There were lots of examples.

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:13.540
I complained about the way one brother conducts meetings for field service.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:35.230
I was jealous of a ministerial servant who received new privileges, and I was pretty

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:47.840
blunt, but how frustrated I get with Yumi's parents.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:58.730
I thought I'd gotten rid of my old personality, but it still lurked inside of me.

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:05.870
Some of my friends were okay with, and even encouraged these bad qualities.

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:12.509
The change was so gradual, I didn't even realize how far I'd fallen.

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:14.909
What do you think I need to do to change?

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:18.949
How about we search for good for building up from the online library?

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:19.949
Sounds good.

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:32.669
Look, we considered Ephesians chapter 4, verse 29, which says,

00:02:32.669 --> 00:02:38.349
Let a rotten word not come out of your mouth, but only what is good for building up to

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:45.080
impart what is beneficial to the ears.

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.400
I was struck by this powerful word picture.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:58.080
Rotten words are as disgusting as rotten food.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:05.240
I didn't want the things coming out of my mouth to discuss my life or anyone else.

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:11.000
But to change, I needed a plan.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:19.439
Now I really try to think before I speak, and I have a goal to give someone real commendation

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:30.879
at every meeting.

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:34.800
I have a goal from my conversations too.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:42.030
I want to keep them wholesome, true, and kind.

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:52.419
It's amazing how speaking kindly to others can make you feel so good inside.

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:58.099
I shouldn't be surprised because it's just another way of showing God's love.
