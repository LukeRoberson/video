WEBVTT

00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:03.799
Welcome, brothers and sisters.

00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:08.599
In our program, we have a thrilling update about the Ramapo project

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:14.599
and reports about our brothers and sisters in Norway, Russia, and Ukraine.

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:20.399
We'll also hear about the tremendous increase in Bible studies, Earthwide.

00:00:20.399 --> 00:00:25.100
And finally, we have a very exciting announcement.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.100
Stay tuned.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.600
Starting this month, January 2023,

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:35.700
we'll resume in-person circuit assemblies and theocratic schools.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.200
We're thrilled to have these opportunities to gather together again.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:46.899
And we're also looking forward to our in-person conventions later this year.

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:53.399
I'm sure like me, you're looking forward to singing that opening song at the convention

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.700
with thousands of our brothers and sisters.

00:00:57.799 --> 00:01:02.799
How's the new headquarters project at Ramapo, New York, progressing?

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:09.299
We're thrilled to inform you that on December 28, 2022,

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.799
the town board of Ramapo approved the zoning for the facility

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:17.799
and gave approval for tree removal.

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:24.500
This key approval will allow the overall project to move forward.

00:01:24.599 --> 00:01:32.099
We hope to begin clearing the site as early as January 2023, this month.

00:01:32.099 --> 00:01:35.900
As the project at Ramapo gains momentum,

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.099
it reminds us of how we felt about the Warwick project

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:44.400
and the thousands of volunteers who supported it.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.099
Soon after we moved in from Brooklyn,

00:01:47.099 --> 00:01:52.400
brother led read an open letter from the governing body at Morning Worship.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.299
With the Ramapo project now moving forward,

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:02.000
let's hear that beautiful letter from 2016.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:09.000
When we think about this first morning worship from our beautiful new headquarters,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.800
the governing body thought it would be appropriate to provide an open letter

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:20.800
to thank all who have shared and the hard work that went into this project

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.900
how we appreciate it.

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:30.050
But permit me, please, to read this open letter from the governing body.

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:35.349
Dear brothers, on behalf of the Warwick Bethel family,

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:40.349
the governing body would like to express deep appreciation

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:45.150
for our lovely new home here at Warwick Bethel.

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.349
How we love our new residences and offices,

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:55.750
the fresh air, quiet environment and beautiful scenery

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.949
are already having a beneficial effect on how we feel.

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:06.150
We are a covenant that now would Jehovah's blessing and help

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.550
we will be able to work even harder

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:13.650
and accomplish even more in behalf of kingdom and trists.

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.849
Even though we do not deserve such a wonderful place to live and work,

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:22.449
we truly appreciate this generous expression

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:29.849
of Jehovah's undeserved kindness, 1 Peter 4, 10.

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:36.849
We are most grateful to Jehovah for the more than 27,000 different brothers and sisters

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:41.050
who volunteered to work on the construction of this project.

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:47.050
Many of you dear friends took vacation time, paid your own transportation costs,

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:50.949
lived in small rooms and got up very early in the morning

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:55.050
to ride buses or shuttles to the work site.

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:59.750
Then you worked tirelessly in all kinds of weather,

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:05.650
putting your heart into supporting this theocratic building project.

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.349
Many of you accepted multiple invitations to work here.

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:16.350
Unquestionably, Jehovah loves you very much for what you have done.

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:22.649
Please be assured that the governing body loves you very much too.

00:04:22.649 --> 00:04:27.149
To borrow Paul's words to the Thessalonians,

00:04:27.149 --> 00:04:34.850
you have become so beloved to us, 1 Thessalonians to 8.

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:39.550
In addition to those who shared in the actual construction work,

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.350
countless other dear brothers and sisters

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:45.850
supported this project from afar.

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:51.250
Self-sacrificing wives back their husbands' participation.

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:54.350
Diligent remote workers lent a hand.

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:57.850
Generous publishers assisted financially

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:04.149
and other loyal ones encouraged and provided practical help to those

00:05:04.149 --> 00:05:08.350
who were able to work at the Warwick site.

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:11.649
Reflecting on those who helped from far away

00:05:11.649 --> 00:05:15.850
reminds us of 1 Samuel 30, 24.

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:20.550
God's Word tells us that the ones who stayed behind with a baggage

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:27.449
receive the same share as the ones who went into battle.

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:32.750
Even though we do not personally know the vast majority of you brothers and sisters

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:35.550
who have supported this project,

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:41.050
for a certainty, Jehovah knows each and every one of you.

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:43.750
As Hebrews 610 assures,

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:48.050
God is not unrighteous or to forget your work

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:54.649
and the love you showed for His name by ministering to the Holy Ones.

00:05:54.649 --> 00:05:58.449
Jehovah expects us to give Him our best.

00:05:58.449 --> 00:06:02.550
That is why He found Cain's sacrifice displeasing.

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:05.850
He knew that Cain could have done better.

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:08.050
Genesis 4.5

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:10.449
But like Abel,

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:14.649
you dear friends of given Jehovah your best,

00:06:14.649 --> 00:06:18.949
we are confident that you will continue to show your whole hearted love

00:06:18.949 --> 00:06:23.350
for Jehovah in harmony with your circumstances.

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:28.850
Genesis 4.4, Matthew 22, 37.

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:33.750
Additionally, the governing body would like to thank from the bottom of our heart

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:39.649
the five brothers who served on the Warwick Construction Project Committee

00:06:39.649 --> 00:06:44.850
for their inexhaustible labors of love.

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:49.550
We also want to thank profusely the many Bethelites

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:55.750
who work shoulder to shoulder with us in connection with this massive theocratic endeavor.

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:58.250
Zephaniah 39.

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:03.050
Included are the brothers on the United States Branch Committee

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:09.149
and the hardworking brothers and sisters in the furniture moving department,

00:07:09.149 --> 00:07:12.050
the maintenance department, the computer department,

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:15.750
the broadcasting department, the transportation department,

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:24.350
and the Bethel office who are still carrying out the gigantic task of moving the Bethel family

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:28.149
from Brooklyn to Warwick.

00:07:28.149 --> 00:07:35.550
We would certainly be remiss if we failed to thank also the thousands upon thousands

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:42.649
of devoted brothers and sisters who labored on the project at Warkill.

00:07:42.649 --> 00:07:46.649
That too was a massive undertaking.

00:07:46.649 --> 00:07:53.149
May Jehovah bless the willing spirit that you dear ones have shown.

00:07:53.149 --> 00:07:59.050
In the Bible, sometimes the thought is repeated three times for emphasis.

00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:09.350
In this vein we say, thank you, thank you, thank you to all who have helped us

00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:17.550
and are continuing to help us bring this wonderful theocratic project at headquarters to completion.

00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:22.149
May Jehovah reward you for what you have done.

00:08:22.149 --> 00:08:28.050
And may there be a perfect wage for you from Jehovah, the God of Israel,

00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:32.549
under whose wings you have come to seek refuge?

00:08:32.549 --> 00:08:34.950
Ruth 12.

00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:42.149
We express our warm love and affection for all of you,

00:08:42.149 --> 00:08:48.450
your brothers governing body of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:08:48.549 --> 00:08:53.350
As was the case for the Warwick project, thousands of volunteers

00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:57.549
from the United States will be needed for Ramapo.

00:08:57.549 --> 00:09:02.350
Thank you brothers and sisters for offering yourselves willingly,

00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:10.049
for your heartfelt prayers and for your generous donations in behalf of the Ramapo project.

00:09:10.049 --> 00:09:19.559
Soon, a special video report on the Ramapo approval will be released on JW.org.

00:09:19.559 --> 00:09:26.759
You may recall that in our last update, we informed you about what's happening in Norway.

00:09:26.759 --> 00:09:32.159
We were shocked when we received a letter from government authorities in Oslo, Norway

00:09:32.159 --> 00:09:37.059
threatening to remove our registration as a religious community.

00:09:37.059 --> 00:09:44.360
We're happy to update you on this case on December 22, 2022.

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:53.159
The authorities announced their decision to deregister Jehovah's Witnesses as a religious community in Norway.

00:09:53.159 --> 00:10:01.259
Then, on December 28, we filed an injunction application with the Oslo District Court

00:10:01.259 --> 00:10:08.460
asking them to suspend the deregistration until the matter had been resolved by the court.

00:10:08.559 --> 00:10:14.860
On December 30, the court granted a temporary injunction.

00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:21.659
We are very grateful to the Oslo District Court for granting this injunction.

00:10:21.659 --> 00:10:28.360
Please continue to pray for a successful outcome.

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:33.259
Recently, we've had some interesting developments regarding Russia.

00:10:33.259 --> 00:10:46.659
On December 9, 2022, the Council of Europe strongly urged Russia to reverse the ban imposed on the activities of all Jehovah's Witnesses

00:10:46.659 --> 00:10:52.360
and to discontinue all criminal proceedings against them.

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:56.860
Time will tell how the Russian government responds.

00:10:56.860 --> 00:11:03.759
Please continue to pray for all of our imprisoned brothers and sisters.

00:11:03.759 --> 00:11:11.559
We have full confidence in the thoughts expressed by the Psalmist at Psalm 9, 9 and 10.

00:11:11.559 --> 00:11:16.559
Jehovah will become a secure refuge for the oppressed.

00:11:16.559 --> 00:11:20.559
A secure refuge in times of distress.

00:11:20.559 --> 00:11:24.559
Those knowing your name will trust in you.

00:11:24.659 --> 00:11:30.360
You will never abandon those seeking you, O Jehovah.

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:34.960
We're happy that some of our brothers have been released in recent months.

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:39.159
For example, on November 30, 2022,

00:11:39.159 --> 00:11:45.559
brother Sergei Poliakov was released after serving a three-year sentence.

00:11:45.559 --> 00:11:52.559
But we want to keep in mind the over 175 brothers and sisters around the world

00:11:52.559 --> 00:11:56.159
who are still in prison for their faith.

00:11:56.159 --> 00:12:04.059
This includes brother Andrei Vlasov, who was sentenced to seven years in appenal quality in Russia.

00:12:04.059 --> 00:12:09.059
The following video gives us an update on his case.

00:12:09.059 --> 00:12:13.360
Andrei Vlasov is a seriously ill, disabled man from Siberia,

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:16.960
a former Russian court sentenced to seven years in appreasoned colony.

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:22.860
This peaceable religious man was convicted merely for believing in God and reading the Bible.

00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:26.559
There wasn't a single piece of legitimate evidence presented.

00:12:26.559 --> 00:12:31.360
For example, regarding the charge of subverting the constitutional structure of the country,

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:32.659
how did he do that?

00:12:32.659 --> 00:12:36.559
There wasn't a single example of anything my husband had done.

00:12:36.559 --> 00:12:39.659
Supposedly, he broke up family bonds.

00:12:39.659 --> 00:12:41.659
What families did he break up?

00:12:41.659 --> 00:12:44.159
What are the names and places of residence?

00:12:44.159 --> 00:12:46.159
Nothing was substantiated.

00:12:46.159 --> 00:12:52.360
In the Bill of Charges, only article 2A2 regarding extremism was referred to.

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:57.460
After Andrei had given his concluding speech on May 23, 2022,

00:12:57.460 --> 00:13:00.559
the court took a break for just five minutes,

00:13:00.559 --> 00:13:05.259
and then the judge announced the verdict, a seven-year prison sentence.

00:13:05.259 --> 00:13:14.820
Before we left for the hearing, my husband asked me not to cry, whatever happened.

00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:17.820
I tried to fulfill his request.

00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:33.029
My reaction was one of shock.

00:13:33.029 --> 00:13:35.029
He was the same for everyone there.

00:13:35.029 --> 00:13:39.029
Friends, acquaintances and relatives, they were all in shock.

00:13:39.029 --> 00:13:43.029
Neither the prosecutor nor the judge considered Andrei's health condition.

00:13:43.029 --> 00:13:49.029
He was arrested in the court room and taken to the detention center in the city of Novakuznyetsk.

00:13:49.029 --> 00:13:53.029
When he reached the detention center, he was initially in a cell by himself.

00:13:53.029 --> 00:13:56.029
There were huge cockroaches running around and cobwebs.

00:13:56.029 --> 00:14:01.029
He was dirty. He made it as orderly and livable as possible for himself,

00:14:01.029 --> 00:14:03.029
so that he could stay there.

00:14:03.029 --> 00:14:10.029
Andrei suffers from a severe form of deformational arthrosis of both hip joints with ankylosis,

00:14:10.029 --> 00:14:13.029
which is a total loss of movement.

00:14:13.029 --> 00:14:19.029
As a result, his ability to move around care for himself and socialize are impaired.

00:14:19.029 --> 00:14:23.029
Just to put his trousers on by himself, elementary things like that,

00:14:23.029 --> 00:14:26.029
he has to lie on the floor and wrestle his way into them.

00:14:26.029 --> 00:14:32.029
The Russian Federation ratified a list of serious illnesses that exempt someone from being imprisoned.

00:14:32.029 --> 00:14:36.029
Andrei's illnesses clearly included, to unequivocally prove this to the judge,

00:14:36.029 --> 00:14:38.029
I procured confirmation from a specialist.

00:14:38.029 --> 00:14:40.029
The illness can be progressive.

00:14:40.029 --> 00:14:43.029
And unfortunately, in Andrei's case, it is already progressing.

00:14:43.029 --> 00:14:47.029
Despite the fact that Andrei is disabled and needs constant medical assistance,

00:14:47.029 --> 00:14:51.029
he was put in a temporary holding cell immediately after the authorities

00:14:51.029 --> 00:14:56.029
raided his home in 2020. Subsequently, he was placed under house arrest.

00:14:56.029 --> 00:15:00.029
His pretrial restrictions lasted for one year and ten months.

00:15:00.029 --> 00:15:06.029
When under house arrest, it was difficult for my husband to be confined at home.

00:15:06.029 --> 00:15:11.029
He was only allowed two hours to walk around the building.

00:15:11.029 --> 00:15:15.029
He wasn't allowed to use the telephone, the internet,

00:15:16.029 --> 00:15:21.029
or associate with anyone except me, as I lived at the same address.

00:15:21.029 --> 00:15:24.029
Even to visit any doctor or dentist,

00:15:24.029 --> 00:15:30.029
we had to formally request permission from the investigator in charge of Andrei's case.

00:15:30.029 --> 00:15:34.029
According to Natalia, Andrei has not lost his optimism.

00:15:34.029 --> 00:15:38.029
He tries to keep in contact with her and his friends by writing letters.

00:15:38.029 --> 00:15:43.029
They all hope that the court of causation will release Andrei from confinement.

00:15:43.029 --> 00:15:47.029
I've reflected on all that we've been through the last two years

00:15:47.029 --> 00:15:54.029
and realized that I was really only frightened when I was anticipating what might happen.

00:15:54.029 --> 00:16:00.029
Whenever things did happen, Jehovah was very close to me and I felt his support.

00:16:00.029 --> 00:16:08.029
Behind Jehovah's wall of protection, I now see that the winds of persecution and trials are nothing to be afraid of.

00:16:08.029 --> 00:16:12.029
Jehovah continues to take care of brother Vlasov,

00:16:12.029 --> 00:16:17.029
as can be seen from this experience that he had in October.

00:16:17.029 --> 00:16:25.029
Another brother, Alexander Putinsev, was being transported in a prison train to a penal colony.

00:16:25.029 --> 00:16:34.029
He had already traveled on the train for ten days when it stopped in Kamarovah region to add more prisoners.

00:16:34.029 --> 00:16:42.029
Our brother Andrei was loaded onto the prison train and placed in a cell with other prisoners.

00:16:42.029 --> 00:16:47.029
The other prisoners started to ask who he was and what he was convicted of.

00:16:47.029 --> 00:16:54.029
He answered, I am Andrei Vlasov and I am in prison for my faith in God.

00:16:54.029 --> 00:16:59.029
At hearing this, a man almost fell off the bench and said to Andrei,

00:16:59.029 --> 00:17:02.029
you and I must be fellow believers.

00:17:02.029 --> 00:17:09.029
Can you imagine, although they were from such different regions and different prisons,

00:17:09.029 --> 00:17:15.029
they were placed on the same train and even in the same cell on the train.

00:17:15.029 --> 00:17:22.029
As it turns out, the wives of these brothers had prayed that their husbands would be able to meet.

00:17:22.029 --> 00:17:28.029
It seemed impossible, but Jehovah made it happen.

00:17:28.029 --> 00:17:31.029
The brothers spent over twelve hours together.

00:17:31.029 --> 00:17:36.029
They enjoyed a much-needed interchange of encouragement.

00:17:36.029 --> 00:17:42.029
Truly, the hero of prayer knows how to care for our brothers.

00:17:42.029 --> 00:17:48.029
And we don't forget our three sisters in Russia who are currently in prison for their faith.

00:17:48.029 --> 00:17:57.029
Sister Olga Ivanova, sister Ludmila Shakoldina, and sister Anna Safronova.

00:17:57.029 --> 00:18:03.029
Sister Safronova is serving a six-year sentence in a penal colony.

00:18:03.029 --> 00:18:11.029
That is the harshest, longest sentence imposed on a sister since the 2017 ban.

00:18:11.029 --> 00:18:17.029
We also keep in mind 71-year-old brother Shamil Hakimov,

00:18:17.029 --> 00:18:22.029
who has been imprisoned in Tajikistan since February 2019.

00:18:23.029 --> 00:18:33.029
Regarding Brother Hakimov, the Commissioner of the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, Nuri Terkel, stated.

00:18:33.029 --> 00:18:48.029
Since 2019, this ailing elderly man has been languishing in a decrepit and overcrowded prison on a bogus seven-and-a-half-year prison sentence.

00:18:48.029 --> 00:19:01.029
This term could very well represent a death sentence for a man wrongly imprisoned for peacefully practicing his religious beliefs as a Jehovah's Witness.

00:19:01.029 --> 00:19:12.029
Although this sentence was reduced in 2020, Brother Hakimov is not scheduled for release until May 2023.

00:19:12.029 --> 00:19:17.029
Please keep praying for Brother Hakimov.

00:19:18.029 --> 00:19:24.029
Around the world, our brothers and sisters are also busy with disaster relief.

00:19:24.029 --> 00:19:34.029
For example, some months ago, it was anticipated that many brothers and sisters in Ukraine would need warm clothing for the winter.

00:19:34.029 --> 00:19:42.029
So, over 200 congregations in Germany were invited to donate clothing and other basic items.

00:19:42.029 --> 00:19:54.029
What was the result? Approximately 36,000 pieces of clothing and 6,500 pairs of shoes were generously donated.

00:19:54.029 --> 00:20:08.029
With assistance from the Poland branch, 105 pallets with 23.7 metric tons of donated clothing were shipped by truck to Ukraine.

00:20:09.029 --> 00:20:11.029
One grateful brother said,

00:20:11.029 --> 00:20:18.029
The items we received as humanitarian aid help us to endure the cold and wet weather.

00:20:18.029 --> 00:20:24.029
It was warm when I had to flee from my home and I could not take along any warm clothes.

00:20:24.029 --> 00:20:34.029
Thank you from the bottom of my heart for your care. This is vivid evidence of the love of Jehovah our Father.

00:20:34.029 --> 00:20:35.029
A sister said,

00:20:35.029 --> 00:20:43.029
We are so touched by your generosity and kindness, you have helped us overcome excessive worries.

00:20:43.029 --> 00:20:54.029
Through you, Jehovah reminded us that he will never leave us or forsake us, that there is no need to be afraid and worried.

00:20:54.029 --> 00:20:57.029
What beautiful expressions.

00:20:58.029 --> 00:21:12.029
Following recent natural disasters, the reconstruction work is progressing well in Cuba, Nigeria, the Philippines, Puerto Rico, the United States and elsewhere.

00:21:12.029 --> 00:21:19.029
We keep all those affected by disasters and those providing relief in our prayers.

00:21:19.029 --> 00:21:29.029
And we thank all of you for your generous contributions which help us to care for our brothers and sisters facing these disasters.

00:21:29.029 --> 00:21:32.380
Thank you.

00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:42.380
Since June 2022, when we return to in-person forms of the ministry, we have been hearing exciting reports from the field.

00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:47.380
We have seen a tremendous increase in the number of Bible studies.

00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:56.380
In fact, worldwide, we have seen an increase of nearly 30% since May.

00:21:56.380 --> 00:22:04.380
That means that now more than one and a half million new Bible studies are being conducted.

00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:06.380
Isn't that wonderful?

00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:16.380
Notice a few comments from branch offices around the world about the growth we've observed since May 2022.

00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:25.380
In Angola, from May, October, 2022, we had an increase of over 265,000 Bible studies.

00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:33.380
In the lands under the Central America branch, we're now reporting over 680,000 Bible studies.

00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:39.380
That's over 20% more studies than we reported in May of 2022.

00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:48.380
In Papua New Guinea, we've had a 15% increase in Bible studies since our return to in-person preaching.

00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:55.380
In the lands under the Central Europe branch, we are happy to report an increase in Bible studies.

00:22:55.380 --> 00:23:05.380
More than 6,800 new Bible studies have been reported just in the first three months of the 2023 service year.

00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:17.380
In the Congo Pinchasa, we have reported over 209,000 additional Bible studies since the reception of public witnessing and the House to House Ministry.

00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:27.380
In the lands under the United States branch, we had nearly 30,000 more Bible studies in just the first two months of the 2023 service year.

00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:34.380
In Spain, we had a 4% increase in the number of Bible studies from May to October, 2020.

00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:43.380
In Mozambique, we are reporting 47,000 more Bible studies since we have returned to our in-person ministry.

00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:48.380
In Venezuela, we reported over 67,000 Bible studies back in May.

00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:53.380
But in October, we reported nearly 105,000.

00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:56.380
It's exciting to see Jehovah blessing the work.

00:23:56.380 --> 00:24:03.380
In Korea, we've had 30 consecutive peaks in the number of publishers.

00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:15.380
We now have 106,050 and we had our 27th consecutive peak in the number of regular pioneers.

00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:19.380
We now have 50,846.

00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:26.380
That means almost half of the publishers are serving as regular pioneers.

00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:31.380
Here in Malawi, we've had a tremendous increase in the number of Bible studies.

00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:35.380
In May, we had more than 87,000 studies.

00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:42.380
But in October, we had more than 130,000 Bible studies.

00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:49.380
In the Philippines, since May, the number of Bible studies have increased by more than 60,000.

00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:58.259
And in November, for the first time, we have crossed the 240,000 publisher mark.

00:24:58.259 --> 00:25:02.259
Wasn't that encouraging? Well, here's one more example.

00:25:03.259 --> 00:25:06.259
In a country where the work is under ban.

00:25:06.259 --> 00:25:12.259
There was an increase of nearly 3,000 Bible studies since May.

00:25:12.259 --> 00:25:19.259
It's wonderful that despite opposition, the work is moving ahead.

00:25:19.259 --> 00:25:26.259
The governing body is thrilled when we hear these reports about what's taking place in the field.

00:25:26.259 --> 00:25:31.259
Truly, Jehovah is speeding up the work.

00:25:31.259 --> 00:25:43.859
Recently, it was announced that regular pioneers will once again have an hour requirement, effective March 1, 2023.

00:25:43.859 --> 00:25:51.859
Pioneers are now busy looking at their schedules and planning how they'll be able to meet the hour requirement.

00:25:51.859 --> 00:25:57.859
The governing body, though, is realistic about the world situation.

00:25:57.859 --> 00:26:05.859
Many branches have reported that pioneers are struggling to meet their hour goal because of the rising cost of living,

00:26:05.859 --> 00:26:12.859
and many are contending with natural disasters, unrest, and war.

00:26:12.859 --> 00:26:19.859
In 1999, the governing body considered the situation of the pioneers.

00:26:19.859 --> 00:26:24.859
The January 1999 Kingdom Ministry said,

00:26:24.859 --> 00:26:29.859
we have observed the mounting difficulties faced by pioneers,

00:26:29.859 --> 00:26:38.859
especially with regard to finding part-time secular work that will allow them to care adequately for their personal needs,

00:26:38.859 --> 00:26:41.859
so as to remain in the full-time service.

00:26:41.859 --> 00:26:52.859
The present economic situation in many lands has also made it increasingly difficult for others to enter the pioneer work,

00:26:52.859 --> 00:26:56.859
even though that is their heartfelt desire.

00:26:56.859 --> 00:27:04.859
During recent months, these and other factors have been carefully considered.

00:27:04.859 --> 00:27:14.859
Because of those factors, the governing body decided back in 1999 to adjust the hour requirements for the pioneers.

00:27:14.859 --> 00:27:28.859
Now, 24 years later, as world conditions continue to deteriorate, the governing body sees that our pioneers are facing similar challenges.

00:27:28.859 --> 00:27:45.859
Therefore, we are very pleased to announce that the governing body has decided to adjust the hour requirements for pioneers effective March 1, 2023.

00:27:45.859 --> 00:27:51.859
You may want to get a pen or something to write this down. Are you ready?

00:27:51.859 --> 00:27:54.859
Here are the new requirements.

00:27:54.859 --> 00:28:01.859
For regular pioneers, the requirement will now be 600 hours per year,

00:28:01.859 --> 00:28:12.859
that is an average of 50 hours per month. For auxiliary pioneers, the requirement will now be 30 hours.

00:28:12.859 --> 00:28:16.859
But notice this, this is very exciting.

00:28:16.859 --> 00:28:30.859
During March and April, and during the month of the Circuit Overseer's visit, publishers can choose to auxiliary pioneer with a reduced hour requirement of 15 hours.

00:28:30.859 --> 00:28:40.859
This should make it possible for many more of us to share as auxiliary pioneers during those months of special activity.

00:28:40.859 --> 00:28:50.859
What about special pioneers and missionaries? They will now have an hour requirement of 100 hours per month.

00:28:50.859 --> 00:29:03.859
Sisters who are serving as special pioneers or missionaries and who are 40 years of age or older have a reduced hour requirement of 90 hours.

00:29:03.859 --> 00:29:17.859
How should we view these adjustments? This is powerful evidence of the great love and tender concern that Jehovah feels for his people.

00:29:17.859 --> 00:29:25.859
We want as many as possible to retain their precious privilege of serving as pioneers.

00:29:25.859 --> 00:29:34.859
And we feel that these adjustments will make it possible for many more to consider taking up the pioneer work.

00:29:34.859 --> 00:29:47.859
Since the number of people requesting Bible studies is increasing worldwide, there could never be a better time to expand our share in the ministry.

00:29:47.859 --> 00:29:54.859
If you are serving as a pioneer right now, we hope that you'll continue.

00:29:54.859 --> 00:30:01.859
If you're not yet serving as a regular pioneer, would it be possible for you to do so?

00:30:01.859 --> 00:30:15.859
And with the memorial season, just ahead, no doubt all elders, ministerial servants and publishers will prayerfully consider if they can auxiliary pioneer.

00:30:15.859 --> 00:30:17.859
Can you do so?

00:30:18.859 --> 00:30:25.859
We look to Jehovah to bless all of these arrangements to his glory and praise.

00:30:25.859 --> 00:30:35.859
Yes, may we all continue to do our very best to find those who are rightly disposed for everlasting life.

00:30:35.859 --> 00:30:39.859
We love you all very much.

00:30:39.859 --> 00:30:44.859
From the world headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses, this is JW Broadcasting.
