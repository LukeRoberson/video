00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:04.089
This means everlasting life.

00:00:04.089 --> 00:00:07.330
That is the Christian hope, isn't it?

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:09.929
Jehovah promises that if we remain faithful,

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:11.769
He will grant us everlasting life,

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:14.570
either in heaven or on earth.

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.010
And that hope sustains us, doesn't it?

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.170
It is like an anchor that stabilizes us

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:23.609
as we weather the storm of this old system of things

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.609
until our hope is realized.

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.609
But we also need what we might call short-term hope.

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:34.450
Now, what is that?

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:40.250
We need hope that Jehovah will help us get through the day sometimes,

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.130
or to help us so that our current challenge,

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.649
our current trial, doesn't swallow us up.

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.289
We need that because life can be discouraging at times,

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:54.250
and hope fights discouragement.

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:58.090
So really, we need both aspects of hope, don't we?

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:59.810
So let's talk about hope this morning,

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:03.850
because when we understand clearly what hope is,

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.370
then we'll know what to do to keep it strong,

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:09.370
and how it can help us when we feel discouraged.

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.170
So first of all, what is hope?

00:01:13.569 --> 00:01:17.409
Women in the world view hope simply as naivety

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:20.170
or unrealistic optimism.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.049
One writer put it this way,

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.409
most people seem to think that hope

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:27.370
is just a dopey form of denying the truth.

00:01:28.209 --> 00:01:31.689
But true hope is not like that, is it?

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:34.650
True hope has a solid basis,

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.969
and is very closely related to faith.

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:40.250
So as we define hope,

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.409
it's important for us to understand this close relationship

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.489
between hope and faith so that we can understand it clearly.

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.650
Because on the one hand, the Bible says that faith

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.769
is the basis for hope.

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:01.049
But it also says that hope is the basis for our faith.

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:04.409
So how are we to reconcile these things?

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:09.289
First of all, how is faith the basis for our hope?

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:14.199
Turn with me please to the book of Hebrews, chapter 11.

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:19.520
And notice just the first part of Hebrews 11-1.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.199
How is faith the basis for our hope?

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:27.199
Hebrews 11-1 says faith is the assured expectation

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:31.439
of what is hoped for.

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:32.960
So do we see the connection?

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.080
Faith provides the basis, the foundation,

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.599
the guarantee for our hope.

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:41.199
Faith is what distinguishes true hope

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:45.080
from that naÃ¯ve, unrealistic optimism we mentioned earlier.

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:47.960
Now the awake illustrated it this way.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.520
It said, when you ask a dear friend for a favor,

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.080
you may hope that he will help you out.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.360
Your hope is not without basis

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.560
because you have faith in your friend.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.479
You know him well and you have seen him act

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:06.719
with kindness and generosity in the past.

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:09.759
Your faith and hope are closely related,

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:14.280
even interdependent, but they are distinct.

00:03:15.919 --> 00:03:17.759
So how does it work for us?

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:20.960
Well we have faith in Jehovah God,

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.240
that he cannot lie,

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.120
that everything he has ever said in the past

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.639
has come true down to the letter.

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:31.719
And so we have sure hope

00:03:31.719 --> 00:03:33.840
in his promise of everlasting life

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.159
and in his promise to help us endure today.

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:39.080
There is certainty.

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.689
Faith strengthens our hope,

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:45.770
but it works the other way as well.

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:47.729
And the Bible indicates that hope

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:50.050
is the basis for our faith.

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:52.210
Now how do we understand this?

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:55.289
Well it turned pleased to Romans chapter four

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:59.610
and notice what verse 18 says about Abraham's example.

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:04.330
Romans 4.18, this is speaking about Jehovah's promise

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.530
to Abraham that he would have an heir.

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:10.569
So Romans 4.18, notice it says,

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:12.689
although beyond hope,

00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:17.250
yet based on hope, he had faith,

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.889
that he would become the father of many nations

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:22.050
according to what had been said,

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:24.250
so your offspring will be.

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.290
Based on hope, he had faith.

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:31.529
Now what does this mean really?

00:04:31.529 --> 00:04:33.769
Well the watchtower explained it this way.

00:04:33.769 --> 00:04:37.850
It said hope is not just incidental to faith,

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:41.250
it is an essential element of faith.

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:42.769
Consider Abraham.

00:04:42.769 --> 00:04:44.050
From a human standpoint,

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.290
he and his wife Sarah were past childbearing age

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:49.689
when Jehovah promised them an heir.

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:51.930
How did Abraham respond?

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.610
Well then it quotes Romans 4.18,

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.250
based on hope he had faith.

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:58.250
And the watchtower said,

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:03.250
yes, Abraham's God-given hope gave his faith

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:08.250
that he would have an offspring, a firm foundation.

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:09.209
End quote.

00:05:09.209 --> 00:05:12.730
So Abraham believed in Jehovah God's promise.

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:14.250
He had hope in it.

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:18.449
And so that laid a foundation for him to exercise faith

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:20.689
until that hope was realized.

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:24.370
While making application to us,

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:26.170
another watchtower said,

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:29.769
if we truly believe the Christian hope,

00:05:29.769 --> 00:05:34.769
our whole life course will be a demonstration of our faith

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:38.009
as was the case with Abraham.

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:44.009
So our hope gives us something to put faith in.

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:47.410
Our hope is that Jehovah will reward us in the future

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:50.009
and will help us with our trials today.

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:52.610
And Jehovah has given us those promises.

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:53.810
We trust in them.

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:55.209
We hope in them.

00:05:55.209 --> 00:05:57.410
And so then we can act in faith,

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:01.579
looking forward to their fulfillment.

00:06:01.579 --> 00:06:04.379
So hope and faith are closely related,

00:06:04.379 --> 00:06:07.379
interdependent, one strengthens the other.

00:06:07.579 --> 00:06:10.620
Faith makes our hope stronger because it gives us the basis,

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.819
the foundation for our faith.

00:06:12.819 --> 00:06:15.379
Hope also feeds our faith

00:06:15.379 --> 00:06:17.899
because if we truly believe in Jehovah's promises,

00:06:17.899 --> 00:06:20.379
then we have something to put faith in.

00:06:20.379 --> 00:06:25.589
And our whole life will be a demonstration of our faith.

00:06:25.589 --> 00:06:27.230
But now how can this help us?

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:30.029
How can we make application of this?

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:33.629
Well, understanding what hope is helps us to know

00:06:33.629 --> 00:06:36.949
how to cultivate it and how it can help us

00:06:36.949 --> 00:06:38.949
to fight discouragement?

00:06:38.949 --> 00:06:41.550
And our Christian hope certainly does that, doesn't it?

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:43.949
This means everlasting life.

00:06:43.949 --> 00:06:45.790
We have faith in Jehovah

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:48.750
and we hope that this promise will be a reality

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:50.430
and that helps us to endure.

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:54.069
But then we also have a promise

00:06:54.069 --> 00:06:55.949
like the one that we love so much

00:06:55.949 --> 00:07:03.500
in Isaiah chapter 41, in verse 10.

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:06.980
Isaiah 41, 10, where Jehovah says to us,

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:09.779
do not be afraid for I am with you.

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:13.699
Do not be anxious for I am your God.

00:07:13.699 --> 00:07:15.379
I will fortify you.

00:07:15.379 --> 00:07:17.220
Yes, I will help you.

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:19.019
I will really hold on to you

00:07:19.019 --> 00:07:22.139
with my right hand of righteousness.

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:26.579
Well, a verse like this, a promise like this

00:07:26.579 --> 00:07:30.300
helps us with what we called short term hope.

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:32.939
That is that Jehovah will help us get through the day

00:07:32.939 --> 00:07:36.100
that our current trials will not swallow us up.

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:41.100
It helps us to not be so discouraged by our trials.

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:46.019
Well, both aspects of hope really need to remain bright, don't they?

00:07:46.019 --> 00:07:47.100
So how do we do that?

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:49.540
How do we keep our hope strong?

00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:51.060
Well, what did we learn?

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:53.339
Faith and hope work together, don't they?

00:07:53.339 --> 00:07:56.980
And so first of all, we take steps to strengthen our faith.

00:07:56.980 --> 00:08:01.300
That is, we do those foundation works that build our faith.

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:03.459
We read God's Word and meditate on it.

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:07.740
We do personal study, prayer, meetings in the ministry.

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:09.699
Because when our faith is strong,

00:08:09.699 --> 00:08:12.180
when Jehovah is real to us,

00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:15.300
then we will have that solid basis to believe

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:18.740
that Jehovah will live up to his promise to help us.

00:08:20.019 --> 00:08:23.500
But also we learn that hope is the basis for our faith.

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:26.139
So knowing that we take the deliberate steps

00:08:26.139 --> 00:08:28.100
to keep our hope bright.

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:30.019
And how do we do that?

00:08:30.019 --> 00:08:34.179
Turn please to Romans chapter 15.

00:08:34.179 --> 00:08:38.970
And notice what verse four says.

00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:40.889
Romans 15 four,

00:08:40.889 --> 00:08:43.450
for all the things that were written beforehand

00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:45.409
were written for our instruction.

00:08:45.409 --> 00:08:50.409
So that, skip to the end, we might have hope.

00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:54.769
Yes, God's Word gives us hope.

00:08:54.769 --> 00:08:58.250
And so we study God's Word with a specific goal

00:08:58.250 --> 00:09:00.210
of brightening our hope.

00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:04.169
We read God's promises, we visualize them, we make them real,

00:09:04.169 --> 00:09:08.289
we pray to Jehovah and look to him for his personal help.

00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:11.409
And when our hope is strong,

00:09:11.409 --> 00:09:12.850
that Jehovah will help us,

00:09:12.850 --> 00:09:14.649
that he will act in our behalf,

00:09:14.649 --> 00:09:18.690
then we will act in faith until that hope is realized.

00:09:19.809 --> 00:09:22.970
And so on those days where maybe we get a bit discouraged

00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:24.570
and are feeling down,

00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:27.129
and maybe overwhelmed or even a bit trapped,

00:09:27.129 --> 00:09:30.009
think about the promises that Jehovah has made.

00:09:30.009 --> 00:09:32.649
This means everlasting life.

00:09:32.649 --> 00:09:36.409
Also that Jehovah will help you today.

00:09:36.409 --> 00:09:38.490
These are the promises that we have

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:41.090
that have a sure foundation.

00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:42.889
We can have faith in them.

00:09:42.889 --> 00:09:45.889
We can put our hope in them.

00:09:45.889 --> 00:09:48.049
And through faith and hope,

00:09:48.049 --> 00:09:50.490
let Jehovah pull you up,

00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:54.850
brighten your outlook and endure with joy.

00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:56.850
As Isaiah 30, 18 says,

00:09:56.850 --> 00:10:01.850
happy are all those keeping an expectation of him.
