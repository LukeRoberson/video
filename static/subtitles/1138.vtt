00:00:01.229 --> 00:00:09.390
Among the many things that Jesus Christ revealed to His disciples was this very old and fundamental

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:11.230
truth.

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:17.469
There is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving.

00:00:17.469 --> 00:00:22.350
Jesus learned this truth from His Father, Jehovah God, who is the greatest example of a

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.670
happy giver.

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:31.629
In Genesis 1.27 we see clear evidence of Jehovah's generosity.

00:00:31.629 --> 00:00:39.229
Genesis 1.27 says, and God went on to create the man in His image.

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:47.829
In God's image He created Him, male and female He created them.

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:54.229
This verse describes humans as a unique creation, different in many ways from all other forms

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:56.390
of life on earth.

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.829
We are made in Jehovah's image.

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:04.870
Jehovah God designed us to reflect His personality.

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:12.750
We have within us the capability of cultivating the divine quality of generosity and to experience

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.950
the happiness that comes from giving.

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:24.069
We really do get pleasure out of giving to family, friends, even to people we don't know.

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:28.030
It makes us feel good to give to others.

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:35.790
However, the most important giving that we can do and the key to happiness in life is

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:41.430
to give our Creator what He deserves.

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:50.829
Revelation 4.11 sets forth clearly the things that Jehovah God deserves, and it shows the

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:54.790
reason why we should give such things to God.

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:56.790
Read with me.

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:09.509
Revelation 4.11 it says, you are worthy, Jehovah, our God, to receive the glory and the honor

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:18.110
and the power because you created all things and because of your will they came into existence

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.069
and were created.

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:25.150
We exist because Jehovah created us.

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:33.030
That fact makes Him worthy to receive from us, glory, honor, and power.

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:39.710
That's what you candidates for baptism have made the decision to do, to give Jehovah God,

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:43.150
glory and honor and power.

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:50.909
You do this by praising His name, by obeying Him and by using your life, your power,

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:56.389
energy, and your whole strength to do His will.

00:02:56.389 --> 00:03:03.150
By getting baptized in symbol of your dedication to God, you are declaring publicly that you

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.750
have given yourself to Jehovah.

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:12.949
You have made a gift to God of your heart, mind and strength, your very being.

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:21.830
You have made this decision because you have come to know Jehovah and you love Him.

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:27.830
We are happy to acknowledge your decision to give yourselves to God.

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:35.379
And we wholeheartedly welcome you baptism candidates.

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:42.060
Giving of yourself in baptism will lead to great happiness because it opens up opportunities

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.860
to give of yourself in ways that truly count.

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:51.939
Your baptism brings you into a special relationship with Jehovah.

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:57.539
It allows you to participate in doing His will with His approval because you are obeying

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:59.259
Him.

00:03:59.259 --> 00:04:06.699
You become one of Jehovah's witnesses, qualified to present the evidence that Jehovah

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:12.250
is the only living and true God.

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:19.810
Your dedication in baptism opens the door for you to become part of the worldwide brotherhood,

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.689
a true modern-day miracle.

00:04:22.689 --> 00:04:28.689
There is nothing anywhere on this planet that can compare to the visible part of Jehovah's

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:35.569
organization made up of people from all nations, tribes, languages and backgrounds, people

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:41.730
who really do love God and love what another.

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:50.009
You have more opportunities now than ever before to give and receive encouragement.

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:56.050
For example, think of the encouragement you get from the brotherhood in fulfillment of

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:01.290
Jesus' promise at Mark 1029 and 30.

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:08.529
In those two verses, Jesus assured His disciples that they would get a hundred times more of

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:14.490
what they left behind in this old world and in the coming system of things He said that

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:18.009
they would have everlasting life.

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:23.370
It must have given Jesus pleasure to share that wonderful and encouraging promise with

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:29.810
His disciples, and it most certainly made the disciples happy.

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:32.050
That's how it is, isn't it?

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:36.850
Giving and making other people happy makes us happy.

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:43.490
The happiness you can experience by helping others is unlimited because Jehovah focuses

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:47.490
on your motive for giving why you give.

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:54.529
Jehovah never takes for granted what you do, and he will always reward you for it.

00:05:54.529 --> 00:06:01.649
Read with me, Hebrews chapter 6, verse 10, and take note of the fact that Jehovah God

00:06:01.649 --> 00:06:08.410
remembers why you give and what you do to advance kingdom interest.

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:15.730
Hebrews chapter 6 and verse 10, it reads,

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:23.810
For God is not unrighteous so as to forget your work and the love you showed for His name

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:30.329
by ministering and continuing to minister to the holy ones.

00:06:30.329 --> 00:06:36.649
As the Scripture shows, Jehovah won't forget what you do because you are motivated by

00:06:36.649 --> 00:06:40.250
love for His name.

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:46.449
Let's now consider more closely two areas in which baptism broadens your opportunities

00:06:46.449 --> 00:06:48.009
to give.

00:06:48.009 --> 00:06:57.209
First, making disciples, and second, helping your brothers and sisters in the faith.

00:06:57.209 --> 00:07:02.569
The foremost way for you and for me to give is by sharing the good news of the kingdom

00:07:02.569 --> 00:07:05.329
and making disciples.

00:07:05.329 --> 00:07:11.209
Jesus' exhortation to make disciples is found at Matthew 28, 19 and 20.

00:07:11.209 --> 00:07:16.769
The commission to make disciples was given not only to the first century Christians, but

00:07:16.769 --> 00:07:23.610
to all of Jesus' disciples right down to the time of the end in which we are living.

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:29.129
Think for a moment about what is involved in disciple making.

00:07:29.129 --> 00:07:32.930
It's the result of preaching and teaching.

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:39.129
And you know that it takes time to prepare for and take part in the ministry.

00:07:39.129 --> 00:07:44.850
The sample presentations we see in the midweek meetings are not complicated, and it's

00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:47.730
good that they don't change too often.

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:54.850
To have a presentation well in mind and be prepared for the field service, you may need

00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:59.769
to give up some time you formerly spent on yourself.

00:07:59.769 --> 00:08:04.930
It takes time to learn a presentation and to become familiar with it.

00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:08.170
But taking the time is worth it.

00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:14.850
It's a good feeling to be prepared and ready to preach, to have something to say and

00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:19.649
a video to show whenever you have the opportunity.

00:08:19.649 --> 00:08:25.329
There are sheep out there, but we don't know where they are.

00:08:25.329 --> 00:08:29.410
And so we try to call on everyone.

00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:34.610
People need to hear about the kingdom, whether they accept the message or not.

00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:40.289
So don't become discouraged if you don't have the kind of result you anticipated.

00:08:40.289 --> 00:08:45.649
Just keep on preaching, and you will be blessed.

00:08:45.649 --> 00:08:52.769
When you preach, you are engaging in the most important work being done today, announcing

00:08:52.769 --> 00:08:58.409
God's kingdom, the fulfillment of Matthew 24-14.

00:08:58.409 --> 00:09:05.049
And this good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabitant earth for a witness

00:09:05.049 --> 00:09:07.809
to all the nations.

00:09:07.809 --> 00:09:12.129
And then the end will come.

00:09:12.129 --> 00:09:17.690
You are successful in obeying Jesus' words to preach the kingdom message, even when

00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:20.490
people reject the good news.

00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:26.129
You can't control how people respond, but you do not let up in preaching the life-saving

00:09:26.129 --> 00:09:29.049
message of truth.

00:09:29.049 --> 00:09:33.570
Honest hearts respond to the kingdom message.

00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:40.370
Be courageous and trust in Jehovah and his powerful spirit to help you.

00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:46.330
Your work will have everlasting results for you personally, and for those who listen

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:50.370
to you and embrace the truth.

00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:58.450
The Apostle Paul tells us at 1 Corinthians chapter 3, verse 9, that by sharing in the ministry,

00:09:58.450 --> 00:10:02.409
you become Jehovah's Fellow Worker.

00:10:02.409 --> 00:10:09.169
When you imagine, Jehovah invites imperfect humans to cooperate with Him, the Almighty

00:10:09.169 --> 00:10:15.370
Creator, in a special work that He considers highly important.

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:21.889
Your faith and hope become stronger as you give by sharing with others what you know about

00:10:21.889 --> 00:10:25.409
Jehovah and the kingdom.

00:10:25.409 --> 00:10:34.649
Keep in mind the simple and enriching truth stated at Proverbs chapter 11, verse 24.

00:10:34.649 --> 00:10:39.129
It applies both materially and spiritually.

00:10:39.129 --> 00:10:45.730
That's Proverbs chapter 11, verse 24, and it reads,

00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:51.690
One gives generously and ends up with more.

00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:58.570
Better withholds what should be given, but He comes to poverty.

00:10:58.570 --> 00:11:05.690
No matter how much you give to Jehovah, you will always get back more than you give.

00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:11.129
You can't out-give Jehovah, isn't that wonderful?

00:11:11.129 --> 00:11:17.049
Seize every opportunity to give of yourself in the ministry, and your giving will continue

00:11:17.049 --> 00:11:19.450
to bring you happiness.

00:11:19.450 --> 00:11:24.809
The more involved you are, the happier you will be.

00:11:24.809 --> 00:11:28.009
Engage in the ministry every week if at all possible.

00:11:28.009 --> 00:11:36.409
Also, think seriously about reaching out to service an exorbitant or a regular pioneer.

00:11:36.409 --> 00:11:40.929
Talk to pioneers about the joy they get from the ministry.

00:11:40.929 --> 00:11:43.169
It's contagious.

00:11:43.169 --> 00:11:49.850
Many doors to wonderful experiences and blessings open to those who reach out to expand their

00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:53.700
ministry.

00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:59.259
Your regular participation in the preaching work allows you the opportunity to develop

00:11:59.259 --> 00:12:07.820
skill in using the Bible, starting conversations, and in using the teaching toolbox.

00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:11.580
All of us enjoy doing the things that we do well.

00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:16.460
When you're good at something, usually you like doing it.

00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:20.139
Work at improving the quality of your ministry.

00:12:20.139 --> 00:12:24.179
As you do, your joy will increase.

00:12:24.179 --> 00:12:30.259
One way joy increases is by participating in various forms of the ministry.

00:12:30.259 --> 00:12:35.980
Public witnessing, house-to-house, informal telephone witnessing, and letter writing.

00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:42.940
Also, you can develop your skills in using the Bible, your tablet or cell phone to bring

00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:46.059
up scriptures or videos.

00:12:46.059 --> 00:12:52.899
Take the time to practice starting conversations and in using the teaching toolbox.

00:12:52.899 --> 00:12:57.940
It does take practice to find exactly what you're looking for and then using it to give

00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:01.100
a witness.

00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:08.340
Teaching strangers and engaging them in conversation about the Bible can be a challenge.

00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:09.899
Why?

00:13:09.899 --> 00:13:16.139
One reason is because some of us are more reserved than others.

00:13:16.139 --> 00:13:20.220
We are pleased to introduce Sister Lorraine E. Jackson.

00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:25.620
Sister Jackson has been serving for many years in special full-time service and visiting

00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:29.580
a variety of lands with her husband, Jeffrey.

00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:38.539
Sister Jackson, at first, when you learned the truth in Fiji as a young person, how did

00:13:38.539 --> 00:13:41.980
you feel about sharing in the ministry?

00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:47.139
Brother Malin Fond, I am shy and reserved by nature.

00:13:47.139 --> 00:13:54.340
And I remember that when I first learned that Jehovah wants us to preach his good news,

00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:59.860
I was excited, but even more so, I was terrified.

00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:06.659
I understood that preaching would mean approaching strangers and trying to have conversations

00:14:06.659 --> 00:14:10.340
with them often when they least expected it.

00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:16.100
And really, all I wanted to do was just be quiet and be on my own.

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:21.779
I think there are many brothers and sisters who feel the same way.

00:14:21.779 --> 00:14:25.700
What helped you to share in the ministry more fully?

00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:31.220
I think the main thing that has helped me is relying on Jehovah's help through prayer.

00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:35.860
Like many others, I talked to Jehovah constantly about my struggles.

00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:44.379
The struggle to say the right thing, the struggle to not show fear in my manner or my voice.

00:14:44.379 --> 00:14:48.860
The struggle to remember the right scriptures to use and to use them well.

00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:56.139
And of course, if someone is rude to try and remain calm and kind.

00:14:56.139 --> 00:14:58.740
Your words are appreciated.

00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:05.139
Tell us, what are some of the things that bring you joy in the ministry?

00:15:05.139 --> 00:15:09.500
The things that bring me joy are the very things I could not have done without Jehovah's

00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:10.500
help.

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:17.860
Things like conversing freely with people, strangers, about Jehovah and the Bible.

00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:24.740
And then having the opportunity to see people's eyes light up when they read or understand

00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:28.980
the Bible verse for the first time, I think those are really precious.

00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:34.379
And of course, helping a Bible student work through a problem and then also trying to

00:15:34.379 --> 00:15:35.860
become their friend.

00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:41.940
I think things like these really show Jehovah's power and support and all I can do is thank

00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:44.460
him for them.

00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:48.259
It's very encouraging for all of us, Sister Jackson.

00:15:48.259 --> 00:15:55.940
My final question is, how do you feel about participating in various aspects of the ministry?

00:15:55.940 --> 00:16:02.740
I know I still lack so much, but I'm so grateful for the opportunity I've been given to participate

00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:08.820
in various aspects of the ministry because they've allowed me to help others start their

00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:15.419
own journeys to becoming Jehovah's friend and also given me an opportunity to work with

00:16:15.419 --> 00:16:19.539
Jehovah and really rely on him.

00:16:19.539 --> 00:16:28.899
I feel the ministry helps one, especially if one is shy, to focus on others, on Jehovah,

00:16:28.899 --> 00:16:36.500
on Jesus, on people and their needs, and not so much on one's own limitations.

00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:43.539
It's true, I'm still very reserved and shy, and as those close to me know, some days

00:16:43.539 --> 00:16:49.379
are good, and other days I feel like hiding somewhere and not saying much.

00:16:49.379 --> 00:16:55.820
However, the ministry has helped me manage my shyness and has helped train me to accept

00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:58.419
other assignments of service.

00:16:58.419 --> 00:17:05.980
I am convinced that anyone, whether a timid or otherwise, can rejoice in the ministry,

00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:12.019
provided they rely constantly on Jehovah and focus on him.

00:17:12.019 --> 00:17:19.740
Thank you very much, Sister Jackson, for such encouraging expressions of faith.

00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:22.539
Jehovah is there to help us.

00:17:22.539 --> 00:17:31.140
If we trust in him and put forth a sincere effort to give of ourselves in the preaching activity,

00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:37.579
the second way to give is by helping those related to us in the faith.

00:17:37.579 --> 00:17:41.259
All wrote about this in Galatians 6-10.

00:17:41.259 --> 00:17:49.220
It reads, So then, as long as we have the opportunity, let us work what is good toward

00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:55.019
all, but especially toward those related to us in the faith.

00:17:55.019 --> 00:18:03.059
Yes, you are part of a beautiful family, willingly use your time, energy and resources to assist

00:18:03.059 --> 00:18:08.099
your fellow believers and work what is good toward them.

00:18:08.099 --> 00:18:12.980
Think about your brothers in the congregation and identify those whom you can assist in

00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:15.220
practical ways.

00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:21.220
Ask yourself, Is there someone in the congregation I could help by giving that person a ride

00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:26.380
to a meeting or perhaps run an errand for him or for her?

00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:31.500
Perhaps visit the elderly and offer to assist them in practical ways.

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:36.539
We all want to show personal interest in our brothers and sisters and be a source of

00:18:36.539 --> 00:18:39.900
encouragement to them.

00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:45.299
Also, we want to support relief efforts for needy Christians.

00:18:45.299 --> 00:18:52.700
Natural disasters occur and there is sickness as well as poverty among many other things.

00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:57.299
Doesn't it thrill you when you read how the brothers respond generously to assist fellow

00:18:57.299 --> 00:19:00.740
believers who are in need?

00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:09.619
In 2 Corinthians 8, 1 through 4, Paul expresses deep appreciation for the brothers in Macedonia.

00:19:09.619 --> 00:19:13.380
And notice why Paul felt that way.

00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:18.920
2 Corinthians 8 verses 1 through 4.

00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:24.160
Now we want you to know, brothers, about the undeserved kindness of God that has been

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:28.440
granted to the congregations of Macedonia.

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:34.640
Having a great test under affliction, their abundance of joy and their deep poverty made

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:38.440
the riches of their generosity abound.

00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:44.920
For it was according to their means, yes, I testify, it was even beyond their means,

00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:51.559
while they on their own initiative kept earnestly begging us for the privilege of kindly giving

00:19:51.559 --> 00:19:57.119
to have a share in the relief ministry for the holy ones.

00:19:57.119 --> 00:20:03.319
The brothers in Macedonia took the initiative to provide loving help to their spiritual

00:20:03.319 --> 00:20:07.880
family in spite of their own poverty.

00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:13.480
What a fine example for us to be generous and ready to assist our spiritual brothers and

00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:24.490
sisters, whatever way we can, giving to others can be done in different ways.

00:20:24.490 --> 00:20:31.009
With that thought in mind, we are happy to interview Sister Penny Pierce.

00:20:31.009 --> 00:20:38.009
Sister Pierce, you have raised a family, you have spent decades in special full-time service,

00:20:38.009 --> 00:20:42.529
and traveled to a variety of lands with your husband, Guy, who was a member of the governing

00:20:42.529 --> 00:20:44.250
body.

00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:51.690
And like Dorcas, you have a reputation for abounding in good deeds and gifts of mercy.

00:20:51.690 --> 00:20:56.970
Sister Pierce, what motivates you to assist others?

00:20:56.970 --> 00:21:02.089
With the answer is found in 1 Corinthians 29, 14, where it says, for everything is from

00:21:02.089 --> 00:21:06.490
you, and we have given to you what comes from your own hand.

00:21:06.490 --> 00:21:10.410
So anything that I may give actually comes from Jehovah.

00:21:10.410 --> 00:21:17.410
Recently, with the coronavirus, we've seen an outpouring of Jehovah's people giving.

00:21:17.410 --> 00:21:23.849
We all have given time and energy, emotions, a listening ear, and video chatting.

00:21:23.849 --> 00:21:29.490
Everyone, young and old, gave love, faith, and trust, and it didn't cost anything.

00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:34.970
I felt Jehovah is doing wonderful things in the middle of a tragic pandemic.

00:21:34.970 --> 00:21:40.130
What you said is truly practical and very helpful.

00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:45.690
Sister Pierce, please tell us the experience you had when you hosted brothers and sisters

00:21:45.690 --> 00:21:48.890
during a special preaching campaign.

00:21:48.890 --> 00:21:53.569
What times we have the opportunity to help materially too.

00:21:53.569 --> 00:21:57.970
Some years ago, when the family was home, we had 30 people coming to stay at our home.

00:21:57.970 --> 00:22:00.410
They were going to preach to refugees.

00:22:00.410 --> 00:22:06.529
I had one bathroom, and I had $25, which I spent completely on food.

00:22:06.529 --> 00:22:08.410
Now I had zero.

00:22:08.410 --> 00:22:10.730
We never told anyone we didn't have money.

00:22:10.730 --> 00:22:12.930
I knew they didn't have money, too.

00:22:12.930 --> 00:22:15.089
We had a wonderful time.

00:22:15.089 --> 00:22:19.049
When the friends left Sunday night, I had more food than when they came.

00:22:19.049 --> 00:22:23.289
That food lasted us for 10 days to the end of the month.

00:22:23.289 --> 00:22:28.890
But I worried about the effect on my teenage sons, so I asked one how he felt.

00:22:28.890 --> 00:22:33.809
He said, I know you have a jar of flour and oil.

00:22:33.809 --> 00:22:36.849
I didn't worry anymore.

00:22:36.849 --> 00:22:39.250
Jehovah certainly blessed you.

00:22:39.250 --> 00:22:44.730
Tell us how you view what you did to host the friends that came to preach in your area.

00:22:45.009 --> 00:22:49.730
Many of these acts of kindness I did were very small to me,

00:22:49.730 --> 00:22:53.890
but often I didn't know the big impact it would have in their lives.

00:22:53.890 --> 00:22:58.609
That's when you realize you've had the privilege of working with Holy Spirit.

00:22:58.609 --> 00:23:02.809
It's nothing I did. It's what Jehovah did.

00:23:02.809 --> 00:23:05.369
That's beautiful, Sister Pierce.

00:23:05.369 --> 00:23:09.769
Now we would like to hear a final expression from you

00:23:09.769 --> 00:23:14.650
of the joy that you receive personally in giving.

00:23:14.650 --> 00:23:18.450
One never gives to Jehovah and not receive back a hundredfold.

00:23:18.450 --> 00:23:22.609
It may not come from the same source, but it will come.

00:23:22.609 --> 00:23:29.289
Jehovah promises in Acts 2035, there is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving.

00:23:29.289 --> 00:23:33.930
I have to admit, Jehovah spoils me with blessings.

00:23:33.930 --> 00:23:37.890
Thank you very much, Sister Pierce.

00:23:37.890 --> 00:23:47.509
Jehovah has certainly blessed you for your generosity and your warm Christian hospitality.

00:23:47.509 --> 00:23:52.349
Helping one another strengthens the bonds of the Brotherhood.

00:23:52.349 --> 00:23:58.190
And there is nothing like knowing that your brothers really do love you.

00:23:58.190 --> 00:24:01.990
That's how the brothers in Jerusalem felt when they were in need

00:24:01.990 --> 00:24:06.390
and received loving assistance from the brothers in Corinth.

00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:12.549
Please turn to 2 Corinthians chapter 9, verses 11 through 14.

00:24:12.549 --> 00:24:18.309
This is where the Apostle Paul describes the reaction of the needy brothers in Jerusalem

00:24:18.309 --> 00:24:21.950
to the generosity of the brothers in Corinth.

00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:28.069
That second Corinthians, chapter 9, verses 11 through 14.

00:24:28.069 --> 00:24:30.910
And this is what Paul wrote.

00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:36.549
In everything, you are being enriched for every sort of generosity,

00:24:36.549 --> 00:24:41.589
which produces through us an expression of thanks to God.

00:24:41.589 --> 00:24:48.349
Because the ministry of this public service is not only to provide well for the needs of the holy ones,

00:24:48.349 --> 00:24:54.150
but also to be rich in many expressions of thanks to God.

00:24:54.150 --> 00:24:58.589
Through the proof that this relief ministry gives,

00:24:58.589 --> 00:25:07.269
they, that is the holy ones in Jerusalem, glorify God because you are submissive to the good news about the Christ

00:25:07.269 --> 00:25:14.269
as you publicly declared and because you are generous in your contribution to them and to all.

00:25:14.269 --> 00:25:25.190
And with supplication for you, they express affection for you because of the surpassing undeserved kindness of God upon you.

00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:32.829
The brothers in Jerusalem glorified Jehovah, not just because they received some material provisions.

00:25:32.829 --> 00:25:39.190
But rather, it was because the brothers in Corinth, who for the most part were new in the Christian faith,

00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:43.430
were motivated by love to send material help.

00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:51.390
Yes, the truth was in their hearts and made them cheerful givers to the brothers in Jerusalem.

00:25:51.390 --> 00:25:57.670
So they all were happy and felt Jehovah's love and approval.

00:25:57.670 --> 00:26:08.150
You baptism candidates will rejoice as you sense and are convinced that Jehovah is pleased with what you do.

00:26:08.150 --> 00:26:16.029
Proverbs 1917 tells us how Jehovah views unselfish giving to those in need.

00:26:16.069 --> 00:26:27.029
It says, the one showing favor to the lowly is lending to Jehovah and he will repay him for what he does.

00:26:27.029 --> 00:26:31.390
Can you imagine lending to Jehovah?

00:26:31.390 --> 00:26:36.109
When we give spiritual or material help to our brothers in need,

00:26:36.109 --> 00:26:40.829
Jehovah sees and views it as a loan to him.

00:26:40.829 --> 00:26:47.869
Remember, you can't outgive Jehovah by giving to others and refreshing them.

00:26:47.869 --> 00:26:54.430
The giver in turn will benefit himself as Proverbs 11.25 says,

00:26:54.430 --> 00:27:03.470
the generous person will prosper and whoever refreshes others will himself be refreshed.

00:27:03.470 --> 00:27:12.069
Today you feel happy because you are giving of yourself to Jehovah, to serve him forever.

00:27:12.109 --> 00:27:16.470
You make us happy by taking that decision.

00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:24.230
We exhort you to maintain your happiness by doing what you can reasonably do to help others

00:27:24.230 --> 00:27:29.309
by giving both in the ministry and in the congregation.

00:27:29.309 --> 00:27:35.430
Jehovah will give back to you in more ways than you can imagine.

00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:42.630
May the way in which you live as dedicated servants of Jehovah reflect forever

00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:46.670
the fundamental truth revealed by Jesus.

00:27:46.670 --> 00:27:52.309
There is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving.
