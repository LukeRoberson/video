WEBVTT

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:06.519
Our ministry is another kind of search and rescue operation,

00:00:06.519 --> 00:00:10.019
and we search wherever people can be found.

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.220
For example, in the following report,

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:16.820
notice the efforts our brothers made to reach people

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:24.199
living in the remotest areas of Africa.

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:28.199
Jesus made the bold statement at X1, verse 8.

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.199
You will be witnesses of me

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:34.200
to the most distant parts of the earth.

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:38.100
This resonates deeply in a country of Namibia.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.899
This warm and beautiful people

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:48.640
are spread across great expanses of dramatic and thirsty land.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.539
The people are not only separated by physical distances,

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:55.840
they also separate by cultures,

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.539
ancient traditions,

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:02.240
and historic injustices.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.540
Since a South Africa branch offers overseas

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.640
the work in this territory,

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.239
we are pleased to assist a group of brothers

00:01:10.239 --> 00:01:12.140
from the capital city Vantuk

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.640
with a special witnessing trip.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.640
So brothers, our journey will start in Vantuk

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.439
and we're going to travel to Humph first.

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:23.840
From there, we're going to go to Tumquay.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.439
We're going to camp in those two places, Hum and Tumquay.

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:32.140
And we may travel a distance of about 1,500 kilometers.

00:01:32.239 --> 00:01:34.340
Let's talk safety now.

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.540
You want to keep three creatures out of your tent,

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.939
animals such as Ahinas, scorpions, and snakes.

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.239
Always the pure tent.

00:01:44.239 --> 00:01:47.239
Tonets facilities, a method

00:01:47.239 --> 00:01:50.239
that most is prescribed for the Israelites.

00:01:50.239 --> 00:01:53.239
When we enter the Herrera home,

00:01:53.239 --> 00:01:54.939
enter through the side gate.

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:56.739
This is to show respect

00:01:56.739 --> 00:01:59.040
because they have areas in their homesteads

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.140
that are restricted for ancestor worship.

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.840
Also, they don't like being asked direct questions.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.040
It would be better to show them pictures

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.840
and let them comment.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.039
The theme scripture first Corinthians 9 verse 22

00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:14.639
said, I've become all things

00:02:14.639 --> 00:02:16.240
to people of all sorts

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.039
so that I might by all possible means

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:20.740
save some.

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.840
And that's really the purpose of our trip

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.939
giving them a hope for the future.

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:44.770
Brothers and sisters, let's enjoy our trip into the caloric.

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:46.669
So we've been as a family involved

00:02:46.669 --> 00:02:50.270
with the Ahinas Antilletry for about 30 years.

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.770
You know, just a privilege to bring the truth

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.469
to these different cultures.

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:57.469
This is probably the only chance

00:02:57.469 --> 00:03:00.469
that they will have in this distant part of the world

00:03:00.469 --> 00:03:02.969
to find the truth.

00:03:02.969 --> 00:03:05.370
When you talk to them about the truth,

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.669
you see how people enjoy listening.

00:03:07.669 --> 00:03:11.539
There's something that changes in their eyes.

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:14.139
The joy that we get as a family

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.240
from teaching people about how to help us.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:19.039
It's just incomparable.

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:23.780
Really rejuvenates our ministry.

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.379
Welcome to the Meeting for Field Service.

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:28.680
We will see two demonstrations

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.780
presenting the good news to a Herrera

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.539
and a sand household.

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:38.439
You put that piece of literature in the person's hand

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:41.439
and you feel a sort of peace.

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:47.039
My grandmother came into contact with the witnesses

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:49.439
through an assigned territory.

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:52.539
She moved to the city to attend meetings

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:54.439
and I went with her.

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:56.439
I learned the truth from her

00:03:56.439 --> 00:03:59.139
and later we were baptized.

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:02.139
I work in the translation office in Vintok

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:04.639
and now I have a part in the translation

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:06.139
of the literature for people

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:08.639
who live in remote areas like these.

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:14.340
We live very far in the bush.

00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:17.939
So I was happy when they came for the first time.

00:04:17.939 --> 00:04:21.540
I even asked them who sent you to my place

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:24.939
because this is the right place that you're visiting.

00:04:24.939 --> 00:04:31.350
These books help me understand my Bible.

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:33.949
It really helps us also as a family

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:37.149
is seeing Jehovah's creation.

00:04:37.149 --> 00:04:40.449
We've been camping here at the Big Bobbub Tree.

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:42.449
I'm sure it's thousands of years old.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:51.779
Really does show you exactly

00:04:51.779 --> 00:04:54.980
how Jehovah feels about every person in his organization.

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:57.980
I mean, if he's willing to send in six vehicles

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.579
over 30 brothers just to find one person

00:05:00.579 --> 00:05:04.980
in one territory about 600 Ks away from any congregation

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:06.879
then he must have great love

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:11.300
for each person in the congregation.

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.899
When Jehovah looks at people or at countries

00:05:14.899 --> 00:05:18.000
he doesn't see groups or nationalities

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.199
but he sees individuals

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:21.600
and that's really his world

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.500
at each individual human being

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.100
gets to know him, learn to love him

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:37.870
and have a close relationship with him.

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:32.209
I send speaking witness.

00:06:32.209 --> 00:06:34.209
I will be thrilled to speak

00:06:34.209 --> 00:06:36.410
to the sent people about God's word

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:38.810
because I've seen how much joy

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:40.810
the truth has brought me.

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:44.310
The old lady we witnessed two years the day

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:47.810
I explained to her that she will also be young

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:49.810
with a fresh skin

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:51.910
and then she was very happy

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:53.509
that she could be young again

00:06:53.509 --> 00:06:56.810
and Jehovah is going to make a paradise soon.

00:06:56.810 --> 00:07:00.209
It's really nice that we don't overlook the children.

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:02.410
You could really see that even those ones

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:04.009
that were sitting for a

00:07:04.009 --> 00:07:06.610
came closer and were seriously watching

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:08.110
the Caleb videos

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:11.610
so it can really touch their little hearts.

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:14.910
I am confident in Jehovah's word of saying

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:18.310
that all the nations will hear the truth

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:19.810
even the sent people

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:22.509
even if they are the last ones to hear the truth

00:07:22.509 --> 00:07:24.009
they will hear it.
