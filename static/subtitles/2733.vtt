00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:09.730
My name is Sting Dot. I was born in 1988 in Darwin non-territory.

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:16.730
When I was eight years old, I realized that life was getting very difficult for me.

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:22.730
I was diagnosed with ADHD, obsessive-compulsive disorder, Tourette syndrome,

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.730
and on top of all of that, I was diagnosed with severe anxiety as well.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.730
My mum said this affected the entire family

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:36.729
because I would repeatedly yell out goodnight to each individual person in the family.

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:43.729
And on top of that, I used to constantly go around the house checking the locks and the windows.

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:49.729
My school life was the hardest thing I'd ever had to deal with.

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:53.729
And my school was approximately 500 metres from my home.

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:56.729
It would take me at least two hours to get to school

00:00:56.729 --> 00:01:01.729
because one of my obsessions was there was cracks on the footpath.

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:07.730
And if I stepped on one, I'd have to go all the way back home and start again.

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:11.730
I found life to be a constant struggle.

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:14.730
And as I got older, it only got worse.

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:19.730
Even at 10 years old, I decided that I wanted to end my life.

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:23.730
So it would make everyone in the family's life a lot easier.

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:29.730
But then we decided to use some medication, which eased my problems a little bit.

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:35.730
Despite having medication, life was still completely unbearable for me.

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.730
I had a constant struggle every day within myself.

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.730
I used to wash my hands hundreds of times a day.

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:46.730
I couldn't leave the home. I couldn't get a driver's license.

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:48.730
I couldn't even get a job.

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:54.730
A major turning point in my life was my mum's unwavering faith in Jehovah.

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:58.730
She used to iron my clothes for the meeting and hang him on the door knob,

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:01.730
even though I wasn't ready to attend the meeting.

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:05.730
But what she didn't know was when my mum went to the meeting with my sister,

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:09.729
I'd get a Bible and I'd try and start to read it.

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.729
I also began to pray to Jehovah.

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:16.729
And then one day I thought, I'm going to give this a shot.

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:20.729
So I put my suit on, I got ready, and I went to the meeting.

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:24.729
When I went to the Kingdom Hall, I was absolutely terrified.

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:26.729
I was so nervous.

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:30.729
But when I got there, I saw an elder who used to come and visit me.

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:33.729
And he made me feel very relaxed.

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:37.729
And then the amazing welcome by the brothers and sisters.

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:41.729
It made me feel like I was part of Jehovah's organisation again.

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:46.729
The scripture that really helped me was 1 Peter 5 verse 7,

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:50.729
because it says, while you throw all your anxiety on him,

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:52.729
because he cares for you.

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:56.729
So this made me feel like I had a very powerful friend

00:02:56.729 --> 00:03:00.729
and Jehovah wanted me to throw my anxieties on him because he loved me.
