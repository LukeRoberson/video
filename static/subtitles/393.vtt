00:00:01.139 --> 00:00:09.380
If you look at Matthew chapter 24, you may want to open your Bibles there, because the text of the day comes from there and we find in

00:00:09.939 --> 00:00:14.060
24 starting in verse 29 through chapter 25 Jesus actually

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:20.219
is talking about the conditions of the time of the end that we're in fact in right now and

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.100
also what we can expect in the great tribulation.

00:00:25.219 --> 00:00:27.219
So our scripture is in

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:31.420
Matthew 24 in verse 42. Let's read it.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:39.500
It says keep on the watch, therefore, because you do not know on what day your Lord is coming.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.100
So what is referred to as coming?

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:49.939
Well, this is speaking about the future time Jesus will be coming as judge.

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:52.740
When is he coming?

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.780
Well, he wanted to say there. You do not know the day.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:03.340
But if you go to the next verse, he started narrows his comment and gives us a little bit of a clue.

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.060
He's talking about a householder being on watch for a thief.

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.620
Let's read it. 43. It says,

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:16.579
but no one thing if a householder had known and what watched the thief was coming,

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:21.099
he would have kept awake and not allowed his house to be broken into.

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:26.859
So if you notice the footnote is says at what time of night,

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:32.939
so Jesus said, well, the householder knew either day or night, we're going to narrow it down to the night.

00:01:33.379 --> 00:01:35.379
That's when you need to be on the watch.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.099
And so it is we are in the last days. That's what he's speaking about.

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:44.180
Now, the coming would be at some point in the last days.

00:01:44.739 --> 00:01:51.500
It's another reason this illustration is good for us because he says the watch will be at night.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.299
Now, what happens at nighttime?

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:59.379
Well, at night time, it's usually where there's adversity. If there's going to be adversity,

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:06.180
there's gloom, obscurity at night time. That's when the thieves come in. Those who want to do evil.

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:10.979
That's when some time armies will launch a surprise attacks.

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.819
That's where beast will roam when they'll roam.

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.979
And as a result, notice what Jesus said in verse 44.

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.740
He says on this account, because of that,

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:30.900
he said, you too prove yourselves ready, because the Son of Man is coming at an hour that you do not think to be it.

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:38.900
So what message was he giving us here? Well, in verse 42, keep on the watch. Verse 44,

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.900
prove ourselves ready. Now, let's take the keep on the watch first.

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:51.219
During the times we're living in right now, why is it that people are not on the watch?

00:02:51.219 --> 00:02:54.020
They don't understand what's happening around us.

00:02:55.139 --> 00:03:03.620
Well, to understand, we can go to Isaiah chapter 56, verse 10, because it gives some indication.

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.860
Isaiah 56, verse 10, speaking about the leaders of Judah.

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:10.099
And listen what it says.

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:19.300
It says, his watchmen are blind. None of them have taken note. All of them are speechless dogs

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:27.139
unable to bark. So the leaders were to be watchmen, but instead he says they were speechless.

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:35.060
Now, dogs have this very keen sense of hearing, and so they hear before humans. That's why they can

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:40.979
bark giving a warning. But these leaders weren't doing it. They weren't warning the people of the

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:48.099
dangers, and thus the spiritual condition they found themselves in. So the leaders of Judah

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:58.259
actually is a fitting symbol of Christendom's religious clergy today, because they're not warning the

00:03:58.259 --> 00:04:04.900
people. And that's why the masses don't understand the serious times we're living in. In fact,

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:14.259
they are spiritually asleep. Now, let's contrast those speechless dogs, so to speak, with

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:19.699
Jehovah's Watchmen, the faithful and discreet slave, just think of what they've done for us.

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:27.139
They keep us alert to the sign of Christ's presence. They help us to avoid the snares of

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:34.180
Satan the devil. They help us to understand and stay focused on the unfulfilled prophecies.

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:40.100
In fact, just think of the amount of spiritual food that they're giving us.

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:48.980
Truly, they are, in fact, on the watch. And as a result, they're helping us to stay on the watch.

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:53.220
But remember, Jesus now narrated down to an individual,

00:04:53.220 --> 00:05:00.980
have to prove ourselves ready, he said. So to stay ready, we cannot have this speechless

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:10.019
dog tendency in ourselves. Now, what do we mean? Well, think about this. If our night watchman

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:15.540
is on his shift and he's going around, he sees a water damage, a water leak,

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:22.259
rather, what is he going to do about it? Will he simply take note of it? Well, if he only takes

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:29.139
note of it, the result is going to be major damage. So inherent within being a watchman,

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:36.420
is you have to do something about it. You can't just see it and not act on it. And so it is with

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:43.060
each one of us. We look at the faithful and discreet slave, but a beautiful example they are giving

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:50.420
us, they are fulfilling their assignment in a superior way. But we must each ask ourselves,

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:59.779
is my internal dog barking? Now, the words of Peter here, second Peter chapter three is going

00:05:59.779 --> 00:06:07.220
to help us to answer and a reason on that question. It's in second Peter chapter three.

00:06:09.459 --> 00:06:17.540
In verse 10, it says, Jehovah's Day will come as a thief, okay? In verse 11, it says,

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:24.500
that's, we need to figure out what sort of persons we are in these areas and our holy acts of conduct

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:30.740
and our deeds of godly devotion. And then in verse 14, we'll read it, therefore beloved ones,

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:36.980
since you are awaiting these things, do your utmost to be found finally by him spotless and

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:45.860
unblemished and in peace. So obviously spotless means when there was a spot, you guy rid of it,

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:54.259
or when there was a blimish, we did something about it. So to manifest these holy acts of conduct,

00:06:54.259 --> 00:07:00.899
that verse 11 is talking about, we have to stay morally clean. Now we're living in a world

00:07:00.899 --> 00:07:06.660
that doesn't want us to be morally clean. They're doing everything to try to get us to think wrong,

00:07:07.459 --> 00:07:17.139
to do things that Jehovah objects to. When we have the first indication that our thinking is not right,

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:25.779
maybe there's an unclean thought or idea comes into our mind, what do we do? Well remember the

00:07:25.779 --> 00:07:32.259
watchman, when he sees a leak, he needs to do something about it, otherwise they'll be damaged.

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:39.379
And so it is with us. Even if we're thinking, if we have a thought of deviating from Jehovah's

00:07:39.379 --> 00:07:48.019
moral standards, then the figurative dog better start barking, and we better do something about it.

00:07:49.139 --> 00:07:56.100
If we don't do so, listen to what the comments of the March 2015 watchtower. It says,

00:07:56.100 --> 00:08:02.259
are we finding the gap between our moral standards and those of the world widening?

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:12.899
If not, we have cause for concern. Could it be that our personal standards, though higher than those

00:08:12.899 --> 00:08:21.540
of the world, are eroding? If so, we need to take positive action to correct matters in order to

00:08:21.779 --> 00:08:32.659
please God. So if we detect a spiritual spot or blimish, let's go to Jehovah God in prayer and ask

00:08:32.659 --> 00:08:42.340
him for help. Let's do research in a way that helps us to identify the weakness, but also how

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:50.019
to fix it. And if needed, let's reach out for help. Have you ever lived next to a neighbor that

00:08:50.019 --> 00:08:58.820
had a dog that barked all the time? It barked for days, for weeks, for months, barking, and barking?

00:08:59.779 --> 00:09:07.940
Pretty soon you'd become oblivious to the bark. Well, may that never happen when our internal

00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:14.899
dog is barking? Yes, may we all be determined to heed Jesus' direction. Keep on the watch,

00:09:14.899 --> 00:09:22.500
prove ourselves ready.
