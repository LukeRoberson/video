00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:08.919
Well class 151 you seem excited and you should be this is a very special day for you

00:00:08.919 --> 00:00:13.919
one you'll never forget just as the entire course of Gilead you'll never forget

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:20.320
and we're happy to be with you today and we will all benefit from the things that

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:27.760
are said today at this spiritual program but even so we know that although

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:32.719
this will benefit everyone involved the program has been designed with you in

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:38.500
mind so every talk given the brothers have prayerfully considered what can be

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.560
said to encourage and as you listen just be certain that the brothers have

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.539
had that in mind but all of us listening today will benefit from the good

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:51.840
things that will come out in this program when the day is over you'll look back

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.119
and recall a program that honored Jehovah and confirmed his love for you and

00:00:57.119 --> 00:01:01.960
again you're never going to forget it during the past five months of your

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.920
schooling you were asked to draw out principles from many different Bible

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:11.319
accounts and you worked hard to do that didn't you and you learn new ways to do

00:01:11.319 --> 00:01:17.799
that to see the scriptures as something that Jehovah wants us to listen to very

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:25.439
carefully and then apply its fine points in our lives so those accounts focused

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.920
on genuine servants of God who with his help succeeded in doing his will and

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:35.599
you are doing the same you examine principles for Christian living you

00:01:35.599 --> 00:01:40.560
examine principles for teaching others you looked at principles about how to

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:47.680
organize the work and so forth this graduation program will do the same with

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.439
that in mind I have a theme for these brief introductory comments I thought it

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:58.480
would keep me focused so here's my theme you are ready to face the things ahead

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:05.359
now notice it's not a question are you ready it's a statement you are ready to

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:11.919
face the things ahead now why can we say this with such confidence because we

00:02:11.919 --> 00:02:18.000
see your faith we see your deep love for our Heavenly Father Jehovah and his

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.759
Son you've trusted in Jehovah you have done well and you made it to

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:28.479
graduation day I know some of you wondered if you would make it but she did

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:35.960
here you are you're graduating with the 151st class of Gilead what a delight you

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.919
undoubtedly agree more than ever before with what the Apostle Paul wrote at

00:02:39.919 --> 00:02:46.919
Philippians chapter 4 and verse 13 where he said for all things I have the

00:02:46.919 --> 00:02:54.039
strength through who the one who gives me power and we know who that is and

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:59.879
Jehovah has surely helped you during these months to make a success of Gilead

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:04.479
school and we're very proud of you for that and you can be certain that Jehovah's

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:11.159
just delighted to see that because you love him and you went through this course

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:16.919
you've gone through with that in mind true Jehovah gave you what you needed and

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:22.400
that's a blessing you must never forget by remembering it you will put that

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.879
blessing to work for you wherever you are in your service to Jehovah in the

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:32.879
weeks months and years ahead really these things you learn that all of us learn

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:39.439
now will service well forever for example whenever you face a task in the

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:45.240
future that seems almost too large for you to tackle or handle you'll remember

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:50.479
how Jehovah helped you in this school your experience and going through

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:57.319
Gilead now adds to your extensive experience the experience you already had

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:03.159
in serving Jehovah but this just enriches it that much more and it will help

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:09.560
you as you face trials and tests ahead in that you'll know you can make it

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:14.039
through what you may view as difficult times because Jehovah will help you to do

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:19.680
it you are growing ever more and more ready to face the things ahead you already

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:25.160
are but you'll grow more and more so like all of us will as we reflect on and

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:30.879
remember what Jehovah has done for us such as helping you to complete this

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:36.399
Bible school course here's an example of things you must be ready to handle

00:04:36.399 --> 00:04:41.720
or you may face soon after your graduation you will be off to your assignments

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:48.800
and as you go have in mind Jesus words where he taught his disciples to pray do

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:55.839
not bring us into temptation but deliver us from the wicked one now focus on the

00:04:55.839 --> 00:05:02.779
words temptation and wicked one they go together don't they temptation and wicked

00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:07.800
when Satan the wicked one doesn't like your success here at Gilead you can be

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.319
certain that he hates this school and all the good that it is accomplished through

00:05:12.319 --> 00:05:18.160
the years and honoring Jehovah benefiting his people and those in the field so

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:25.160
then what temptations or stumbling blocks might Satan try to place before you now

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:29.639
that you've graduated from this school well here are a few things and they are

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:36.600
things that all of us must face for example if you're not careful you might be

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:42.240
tempted to become self satisfied with what you have accomplished don't ever let

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:47.279
that happen to you never be self satisfied keep setting goals for yourself

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:53.680
strive to please Jehovah more and more each day and all that you do it's the

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:58.680
principles that we draw from God's word that help us to do that yet here's a

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:03.759
caution you're healthy desire to keep setting goals must not be allowed to

00:06:03.759 --> 00:06:08.360
lead you into the next temptation and that is this the temptation to give into

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:17.279
pride that can happen it can happen to a person when he or she forgets who has

00:06:17.279 --> 00:06:22.920
truly helped them to succeed and that is Jehovah those who forget about

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:28.079
Jehovah may become ambitious and try to outshine others we must never allow

00:06:28.079 --> 00:06:33.360
that to happen to our heart mind we must never become like that in fact we

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:38.240
must fight against pride and one key way to do this is to remember that in all

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:45.360
that you do in all that we do it is always about Jehovah when we have that

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:51.519
focus we will succeed in doing things his way the right way no matter what we

00:06:51.519 --> 00:06:56.319
face in the future so we reflect on his blessings we see how he strengthened

00:06:56.319 --> 00:07:02.160
us we're confident he will continue to do so and he will do that for you but we

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:07.399
never forget that he's in charge it's always about Jehovah and so we do

00:07:07.399 --> 00:07:13.439
everything out of love for him and that of course leads into love for others

00:07:13.439 --> 00:07:19.839
because he loves others if a person fails to remember how Jehovah has blessed

00:07:19.839 --> 00:07:25.040
him or her that person might become big in their own eyes like King Saul did

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:30.279
you'll recall his example where did that eventually lead Saul it let him away

00:07:30.279 --> 00:07:37.839
from Jehovah's favor and blessing people like Saul fail to maintain faith they

00:07:37.839 --> 00:07:44.519
fail to remain humble what about your faith and your humility well we see

00:07:44.519 --> 00:07:49.160
those good qualities in you and that's why we confidently state you're ready to

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:54.480
face the things ahead along with Jehovah's blessing your faith will help you

00:07:54.480 --> 00:08:00.000
to conquer any temptation that the wicked one the tempter may place before you

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:06.279
and your humility will help you to remain unbreakable you will be able to

00:08:06.279 --> 00:08:12.639
defeat the tempter along with resisting temptation your Gilead training will

00:08:12.639 --> 00:08:17.399
also help you to continue supporting our vital work for Jehovah's Kingdom his

00:08:17.399 --> 00:08:23.160
people and for those who will yet listen in fact for all of God's people this

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:29.040
is the greater purpose behind any training that we receive from him right so

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:33.759
then wherever you serve never forget the purpose behind the blessings that you

00:08:33.759 --> 00:08:38.360
have experienced in this school trust in Jehovah and in his son to help you at

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:42.360
all times use your Gilead training in the branches and territories to where

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:47.039
you are going keep in mind that with God's help the one who gives you power

00:08:47.039 --> 00:08:52.720
you are ready to face the things ahead well we will say a little bit more about

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:57.360
this at the conclusion of the program now we're going to enjoy a series of

00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:02.480
encouraging talks that for all of us will strengthen our faith build up our

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:08.480
trusting God and highlight his wonderful purpose that we support
