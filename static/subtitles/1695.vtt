00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.620
Meet Juan Cayul from Chile.

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.220
He's of the Mapuche tribe, a tribe which has faced discrimination over the years.

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:18.219
Because of the discrimination, some may be reluctant to use their language Mapudangun in public.

00:00:18.219 --> 00:00:25.420
This became a challenge for Juan since he wanted to give his best in the ministry for Jehovah.

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.100
Mapudangun means the speech of my land.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.820
It's a beautiful and expressive language, and it's the language of my heart.

00:00:35.659 --> 00:00:40.700
When I was 12 years old, I went to live with my grandfather and my uncle's family so I could

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:47.579
study it in nearby school. My cousins spoke Mapudangun a lot, which made me really happy.

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.530
When I saw that some of my classmates didn't understand their schoolwork, especially a math class,

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:02.929
I would try to help them out. That's when I started to think about becoming a math teacher,

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:09.730
so I could really help others. But the head teacher told me that because I was speaking

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:14.849
Mapudangun and because I was helping my classmates, she was going to lower my grades.

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:22.530
When my father saw my grades, he was furious. He accused me of being lazy and not studying.

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.489
He withdrew me from school and I went back home to Trumin.

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:37.219
My dream of becoming a teacher was shattered because my dad had suffered so much as a victim

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:47.469
of discrimination. He told us we were not to speak Mapudangun. When I think about everything

00:01:47.469 --> 00:02:00.980
that happened, it makes me very sad. Years later, I met Sylvia, who was Mapucci like me.

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:07.219
She proved to be a sensitive and loving person. We spoke Mapudangun together and that helped her

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:15.379
leave the bitterness I felt in my heart. Sometime later, I learned about someone else who made me feel

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:24.180
loved and valued Jehovah. That changed my life. All my pain disappeared once I got to know Jehovah.

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:32.699
My wife and I studied the Bible with the witnesses in Spanish. And so when I started to preach and

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:40.699
teach, I used Spanish too. One day, I was out in service and as we approached the house,

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:47.419
an elderly Mapucci woman came to the door. She was scared. So straight away, I greeted her in

00:02:47.419 --> 00:02:59.629
Mapudangun. She invited us inside and spoke with us. That was the first time I had spoken about

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:09.780
Jehovah in my mother tongue. On her way back, I was deep in thought, praying to Jehovah about how

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:20.400
to help the Mapucci people. Many years passed before I saw an answer to my prayers. Then one day

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.759
after the meeting, I received an invitation to be a speaker at the first assembly to include talks

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:33.789
in Mapudangun. But I didn't want to accept the assignment. I felt worthless because of all the

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:44.909
discrimination I had endured. So I prayed again and again to Jehovah and began to meditate a lot.

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:53.389
Jehovah was now giving me an answer to my prayers. He sees our true value.

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:25.069
I was so happy, so very happy. I understood that Jehovah loved me and cared for me and that he would

00:04:25.069 --> 00:04:32.670
continue to help me. In just a few years, not one, but several Mapudangun congregations were formed.

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:39.149
And now my wife and I, as well as our two children, serve in Mapudangun language congregations.

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:48.560
I've been assisting with Mapudangun translation for more than seven years now. When I tell the

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:53.120
brothers and sisters who work with me at the translation office about my childhood dream of becoming

00:04:53.120 --> 00:05:01.709
a teacher, they tell me, you're our teacher now. I want to say to my brothers and sisters around

00:05:01.709 --> 00:05:08.189
the world, don't put yourselves down. You're precious. You're precious to Jehovah. He will always

00:05:08.189 --> 00:05:13.839
help you.
