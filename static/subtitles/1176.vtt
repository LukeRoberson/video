00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:09.580
Absalom quickly organized a full-scale conspiracy for the throne.

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:15.580
He forced his own father, King David, to flee for his life.

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:34.479
While David was traveling through Bahiroom, Shimei began walking along the mountainside.

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:38.479
Why should this dead dog, Shimei, curse my lord the king?

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:44.659
Let me go over, please, and take off his head.

00:00:44.659 --> 00:00:47.659
What happened next, Nathan?

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:51.659
Well, David wasn't so quick to act.

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:53.659
Leave him alone!

00:00:53.659 --> 00:01:01.020
Perhaps Jehovah will see my affliction, and will restore goodness to me.

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:20.819
Myfibisheth, his grandfather had tried to kill David.

00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:26.819
When David became King and asked myfibisheth to the palace, he must have wondered why.

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:41.170
Here's your servant.

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:46.560
Do not be afraid.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.560
I will certainly love to you for the sake of your father, Jonathan.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:57.219
Know what will return to you all of the land of Saul, your grandfather.

00:01:57.219 --> 00:02:08.900
And you will always die at my table.

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:13.900
What is your servant that you have turned your attention to it?

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.900
A dead dog like me!

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:43.099
David, Saul, and their army returned from striking down the Philistines.

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:49.099
The women of all the cities of Israel greeted them with a celebration of song and dance.

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:58.099
The women began singing, Saul has struck down his thousands, and David, his tens of thousands.

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:05.330
You think left to give him was the kingship?

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:15.930
From that day on, Saul was always suspicious of David.

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:29.969
Jealousy controlled Saul, and ruined his friendship with David, and with Jehovah.

00:03:29.969 --> 00:03:38.969
David was popular, good-looking, physically strong, a talented musician, and he had been anointed as the next king.

00:03:38.969 --> 00:03:49.539
Here is my eldest daughter, Mirab, and I will give her to you as a wife.

00:03:49.539 --> 00:04:02.780
Who am I to be son-in-law to the king?

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:07.780
Other men would have used this opportunity to boast or to promote themselves.

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.780
Some just couldn't understand why David wouldn't take more credit.

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.780
David, you're the finest warrior we've ever had.

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.779
Haven't you earned the right to accept your praise?

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:22.779
But who really trains me for battle?

00:04:22.779 --> 00:04:25.779
Who rescues me from the sword?

00:04:25.779 --> 00:04:27.779
Jehovah is my rock.

00:04:27.779 --> 00:04:29.779
He should be praised.

00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:42.060
What is any man next to him?

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.060
David was sick.

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.060
Absalom saw this as an opportunity to seize power.

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:53.660
Like his father, David, he had many gifts.

00:04:53.660 --> 00:05:00.629
He was born into a wealthy and powerful family.

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:06.629
He turned heads wherever he went, and he relished the attention.

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:19.769
Men would come to the city gate, so the king would hear their legal case.

00:05:19.769 --> 00:05:25.769
If I was appointed judge in the land, every man with a legal case or judgment could come to me,

00:05:25.769 --> 00:05:28.769
and I would see he receives justice.

00:05:28.769 --> 00:05:31.769
You are from the royal house, mother.

00:05:31.769 --> 00:05:36.560
My mother too has royal blood.

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:47.620
It seems I was born to lead, but God will do what's best for his people.

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:51.620
Absalom seemed to be interested in the people who came to David,

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:54.620
but he was only interested in himself.

00:05:54.620 --> 00:06:04.310
The Ark of the Covenant was finally brought to Jerusalem.

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:07.310
David and the people danced and celebrated.

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:14.889
Has he forgotten his king?

00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:16.889
Dancing like a common fool.

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:33.360
How glorious the king of Israel made himself for the eyes of the slave girls of his servants.

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:36.360
Just as an empty-headed man.

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:39.360
My celebration was before Jehovah.

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:44.360
Michael did not love others as much as she loved herself.

00:06:44.360 --> 00:07:14.050
David was faithful to Jehovah for decades, but then he let his guard down.

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:17.050
And he coveted a married woman.

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:30.310
Bring Bathsheba to me.

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:40.139
David and Bathsheba committed adultery, and she became pregnant.

00:07:40.139 --> 00:07:46.139
To hide their sin, David secretly ordered Bathsheba's husband to be killed.

00:07:55.720 --> 00:08:19.120
And he hurt the God who had done so much for him.

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:25.120
On the run from Saul, David's men came to see Nebel, who sheep they had protected.

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:28.120
They asked only for what Nebel could spare.

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:40.909
David didn't wait to react.

00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:43.909
Everyone, stop it or so!

00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:48.909
David took action, but he didn't seek Jehovah's direction.

00:08:48.909 --> 00:08:59.330
Still, Jehovah intervened through Nebel's discerning wife, Abigail.

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:03.330
My Lord, let the blame be on me.

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:10.330
It is Jehovah who has held you back from incurring blood guilt and from taking revenge.

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:12.330
You have no regret in your heart.

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:17.330
Nebel was senseless, but he was still David's Israelite brother.

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:20.330
And he deserved to be treated lovingly.

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:27.330
David had become provoked, and Abigail rescued him from making the situation much worse.

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:41.980
Praise Jehovah that the God of Israel has sent you this day to meet me.

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:55.460
The Amalekites kidnapped the wives and children of David and his men, and his men became very bitter.

00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:56.460
You?

00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:59.460
Our families were never safe here.

00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:01.460
You let them do their death!

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:04.460
Life for life, David! You should be stoned!

00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:06.460
Beys, please.

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:09.460
Jehovah may have rescued them.

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:26.179
We don't know.

00:10:26.179 --> 00:10:37.080
David looked to Jehovah for help.

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:44.080
David fought the Amalekites, rescued all of the kidnapped Israelites, and recovered all of the flocks that had been taken.

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:52.419
Jehovah protected us, and gave him to our hand the Marauder van that came against us.

00:10:53.419 --> 00:11:00.419
David could have given the spoils of war only to those who trusted in him, but he shared with all.

00:11:00.419 --> 00:11:03.419
It was as though they had never wronged him.

00:11:03.419 --> 00:11:14.230
I've escaped from the camp of Israel.

00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:16.230
Many have fallen and died.

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:19.230
Even Saul and his son Jonathan have died.

00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:20.230
How do you know?

00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:24.230
I stood above him and put it to death.

00:11:58.610 --> 00:12:06.620
Teach all of our people this good for Saul and Jonathan.

00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:11.620
Saul and Jonathan, you loved him cherished during your life.

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:24.679
How the mighty have fallen and the weapons of war have perished.

00:12:24.679 --> 00:12:32.299
Not once did David mention Saul's hurtful acts.

00:12:32.299 --> 00:12:40.299
To David, the assassination of Saul was an unrighteous act, and David could never rejoice over that.

00:12:40.299 --> 00:12:53.860
Here, I am dulling in a house of cedars, while the ark of the covenant of Jehovah is under tent cloths.

00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:58.860
Do whatever is in your heart, for the true God is with you.

00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:08.500
But I had spoken too quickly.

00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:09.500
David.

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:10.500
Nathan.

00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:13.700
Go on, Nathan.

00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:14.700
What is it?

00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:16.700
This is what Jehovah says.

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:20.700
You are not the one who will build me a house to dwell in.

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:25.850
David's son Solomon would build the temple.

00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:37.850
But David didn't feel sorry for himself, and he didn't try to push ahead without Jehovah's blessing.

00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:43.929
David knew God's will, and he rejoiced in it.

00:13:43.929 --> 00:14:09.019
Later, he gathered a vast amount of materials so his son could build.

00:14:09.019 --> 00:14:19.490
David had been pursued ruthlessly by Saul.

00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:27.899
He and his men faced hunger, fear, and threat of death.

00:14:27.899 --> 00:14:29.899
It's Saul.

00:14:29.899 --> 00:14:34.899
Today, God has surrendered your enemy into your hand.

00:14:34.899 --> 00:14:37.899
Let me pin him to the ground.

00:14:37.899 --> 00:14:44.980
David could have ended his trial then and there.

00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:46.980
But he was a man of love.

00:14:46.980 --> 00:15:07.440
And over the standpoint, that she left my hand against the appointed up Jehovah.

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:13.440
Despite all that Saul had done, David left the judging to Jehovah,

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:15.440
whom he loved and trusted.

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:30.250
David was on the run from Saul.

00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:35.250
His friend Jonathan, Saul's son, hatched a plan to protect David.

00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:38.250
But could David really believe Jonathan?

00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:42.250
After all, Jonathan was second in line to the throne.

00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:46.250
Only David seemed to stand in his way.

00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:48.250
Saul had betrayed David.

00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:50.250
My Jonathan do the same.

00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:53.250
Could David put his life in Jonathan's hands?

00:15:53.250 --> 00:15:58.230
May Jehovah do that to Jonathan and more.

00:15:58.230 --> 00:16:03.230
If I do not disclose it to you and send you away in peace.

00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:05.230
That's where I never to withdraw.

00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:10.230
All I love from you and your household.

00:16:10.230 --> 00:16:13.230
May Jehovah be between us forever.

00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:17.230
David loved Jonathan and he believed him.

00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:20.230
That trust saved David's life.

00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:27.259
Abner had been chief of Saul's army.

00:16:27.259 --> 00:16:34.259
He pursued David in the wilderness and supported David's rival after David became king.

00:16:34.259 --> 00:16:41.490
So why was Abner coming to see David?

00:16:41.490 --> 00:16:44.490
My Lord, the king, make a covenant with us.

00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:47.490
We now support you as king.

00:16:47.490 --> 00:16:59.070
Because Jehovah has promised a salvation by means of your hand.

00:16:59.070 --> 00:17:02.830
I will make a covenant with you.

00:17:02.830 --> 00:17:06.829
David trusted Abner and hoped that he would now remain loyal.

00:17:06.829 --> 00:17:14.630
But Joab saw things differently.

00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:15.630
What have you done?

00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:16.630
You know Abner.

00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:17.630
He came here to fool you.

00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:19.630
And to get to know your every move.

00:17:19.630 --> 00:17:21.630
And find out everything that you're doing.

00:17:21.630 --> 00:17:24.039
Careful.

00:17:24.039 --> 00:17:26.039
You know the law.

00:17:26.039 --> 00:17:27.039
You must not hold a grudge.

00:17:27.039 --> 00:17:32.039
And you must love your fellow men as yourself.

00:17:32.039 --> 00:17:35.039
Joab's distrust grew into vengeance.

00:17:35.039 --> 00:17:37.039
He later killed Abner.

00:17:37.039 --> 00:17:42.789
Those who hate expect the worst.

00:17:42.789 --> 00:17:45.789
But those who love never lose hope.

00:17:45.789 --> 00:18:01.019
When Jehovah chose David to be king.

00:18:01.019 --> 00:18:04.019
He had already rejected Saul.

00:18:04.019 --> 00:18:09.019
Even so, it wasn't yet Jehovah's time for David to begin ruling.

00:18:09.019 --> 00:18:12.019
Waiting wasn't always easy for David.

00:18:12.019 --> 00:18:16.019
He became a fugitive running for his life.

00:18:16.019 --> 00:18:19.019
Even his own men once threatened to kill him.

00:18:19.019 --> 00:18:24.160
22 years had passed.

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:28.160
Finally, he became king over all of Israel.

00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:35.410
True, king Saul and even some of David's friends abandoned him.

00:18:35.410 --> 00:18:37.410
But David endured it all.

00:18:37.410 --> 00:18:40.410
Jehovah had never abandoned David.

00:18:40.410 --> 00:18:48.279
So how could David ever give up his love for Jehovah?

00:18:48.279 --> 00:18:51.279
When David was anointed as king.

00:18:51.279 --> 00:18:57.779
He couldn't have imagined the tests that would come his way.

00:18:57.779 --> 00:19:02.539
But love helped him to face all of them.

00:19:02.539 --> 00:19:06.539
David saw that without love,

00:19:06.539 --> 00:19:16.019
we become jealous, get puffed up, behave indecently.

00:19:16.019 --> 00:19:23.940
Look for our own interests and become provoked.

00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:34.019
Love helped David to be patient, to be kind,

00:19:34.019 --> 00:19:43.240
not to brag, not to keep account of the injury,

00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:48.220
and not to rejoice over unrighteousness.

00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:51.220
Instead, love helped him to rejoice with the truth,

00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:59.710
to bear all things, to believe all things,

00:19:59.710 --> 00:20:03.710
to hope all things,

00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:06.710
and to endure all things.

00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:09.710
David faced many trials,

00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:12.710
but love was equal to all of them.

00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:17.569
When David comes back to life,

00:20:17.569 --> 00:20:23.569
he, like love itself, can live on forever.
