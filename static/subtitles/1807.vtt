00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:06.759
Now I'd like to introduce to you two of my friends with whom I work closely here in Brooklyn,

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:09.119
Isaac and Gene Murray.

00:00:09.119 --> 00:00:11.919
It's nice to have you both along here.

00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:20.879
Now, originally, Sucky and Gene were from South Africa, but they were assigned to the United States back in 1981.

00:00:20.879 --> 00:00:27.879
Sucky, can we ask you first of all, what are some of the challenges that you and Gene have faced in your life?

00:00:27.879 --> 00:00:30.879
We have faced a number of challenges.

00:00:30.879 --> 00:00:41.880
Two that come to mind is changing continents, going to live in another continent, and when Gene was diagnosed with cancer about 10 years ago.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.880
Well, they sound like difficult challenges, but let's just start with that first one.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:52.880
Why was it difficult for you to move from South Africa to the United States?

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:57.880
Well, on the surface, it may sound like a simple matter.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:10.879
But when you deal with cultural issues and you take into consideration your own imperfection, flaws, lack of experience, it can become very challenging.

00:01:10.879 --> 00:01:18.879
Looking back, it wasn't all that difficult, but in the process, we learn some wonderful lessons.

00:01:18.879 --> 00:01:21.879
What would you mind telling this a few of those lessons that you learned?

00:01:21.879 --> 00:01:30.879
Well, we know Jehovah's chariot is on the move, but Jehovah does not deal with these people in mass.

00:01:30.879 --> 00:01:34.879
We do not behave like an army.

00:01:34.879 --> 00:01:45.879
We dress the same, walk the same, go through the same routines, boot camp, demanding every last drop of blood.

00:01:46.879 --> 00:01:52.879
No, Jehovah deals with us very kindly and individually, personally.

00:01:52.879 --> 00:01:55.879
He deals with all the issues of the universe.

00:01:55.879 --> 00:02:00.879
At the same time, he deals with us as individuals.

00:02:00.879 --> 00:02:02.879
Makes us think of the Israelites.

00:02:02.879 --> 00:02:07.879
When they came out of Egypt, they went through the Red Sea.

00:02:07.879 --> 00:02:14.879
There were Jehovah's people, millions of them, older people, babies, young people.

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:19.879
Bearing down on them was the military machine of Egypt.

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:25.879
Yet Jehovah took every single one of them safely through the Red Sea.

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:31.879
Jehovah cares not only on an objective level, but personally.

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:33.879
He is like a loving father.

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:39.879
He is interested in our fears, our feelings of inadequacy or inability.

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:44.879
At the same time, though, he listens very carefully to us.

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:48.879
Are we willing to obey?

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:50.879
Are we willing to learn?

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:53.879
Are we willing to listen to him?

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:56.879
And it matters to him very, very much.

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:58.879
The bottom line is this.

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:06.879
Jehovah God gives us the privilege to be able to say he is our friend.

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:09.879
And for imperfect people, that is the greatest achievement.

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:14.879
To be able to say Jehovah is my friend.

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:17.879
Coping with our own imperfections is one thing.

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:24.879
But, coping with life-threatening situations can be very difficult.

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:28.879
Well, we appreciate very much those excellent lessons you referred to.

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:32.879
But it seems that you are talking now about gene situations.

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:37.879
Jean, could we just ask you, when you were diagnosed with having cancer,

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:41.879
how did you feel and how were you able to cope with that?

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:43.879
Well, it was a shock.

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:45.879
I have to be quite frank about that.

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:50.879
And the treatments that followed were very harsh, so it made life difficult.

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:53.879
And I really came face to face with my own mortality.

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:56.879
But what helped me were two things.

00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:00.879
And the first was the love and care of my brothers and sisters.

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:04.879
I felt as if they helped me, they supported me,

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:09.879
and as if Jehovah was using them to assure me that he loved me,

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:11.879
almost like he was giving me a hug through them.

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:13.879
That's how I really felt.

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:18.879
And the second thing that helped me a lot was thinking about the men and women in the Bible,

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:20.879
because life for them was not easy.

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:22.879
It was challenging.

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:28.879
But through all their trials, they managed to grow, they managed to improve on their relationship with Jehovah.

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:34.879
And I especially loved the example of Job, because he went through trials, many, many trials,

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:36.879
that much more than I ever faced.

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:40.879
But at the end of all his trials, he said something interesting.

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:41.879
May I read it?

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:43.879
Please, we'd love to hear it.

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:45.879
This is in Job 42 verse 5.

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:46.879
It says,

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:52.879
My ears have heard about you, but now I do see you with my eyes.

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:55.879
And Job said these words, I see you with my eyes,

00:04:55.879 --> 00:05:01.879
he was in this physical state of sickness, and Job hadn't cured him yet,

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:07.879
and yet he was able to move his focus from himself onto Jehovah and onto his sovereignty.

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:10.879
He realized it wasn't all about him, it was about Jehovah's sovereignty.

00:05:10.879 --> 00:05:13.879
And honestly, that's a lesson I needed to learn.

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:19.879
I had to learn, it's not just all about me, it's about Jehovah's will and Jehovah's sovereignty.

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:24.879
And in addition to all these trials and learning that lesson,

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:29.879
it's really an opportunity to grow, and an opportunity to be trained by Jehovah,

00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:32.879
an opportunity to be corrected by him.

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:38.879
And yet I knew if I really loved Jehovah, I really loved him, he will never abandon me.

00:05:38.879 --> 00:05:41.879
Well, those comments are so beautiful.

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:47.879
Thank you so much for being willing to share those personal insights and to help us with those lessons.

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:54.449
Well, we've really appreciated hearing that experience, haven't we?
