00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:13.210
So much to do and so few hours in a day

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:18.210
It's hard to steal away

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:28.210
Moments to pray but we have got to find our way

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:34.740
Make time for Jehovah

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:41.179
Make him part of your life

00:00:41.179 --> 00:00:45.179
Don't have life in this world draw you away

00:00:45.179 --> 00:00:54.570
Make time for Jehovah

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:11.140
Friends grow close when words from the heart are shared

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.140
And see that he cares how well we know

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:24.900
Is there a time for Jehovah

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:31.260
And part of your life

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:38.420
Don't have life in this world draw you away

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:46.379
Make time for Jehovah

00:01:46.379 --> 00:02:03.530
And are to see ourselves and paradise

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:34.650
For Jehovah
