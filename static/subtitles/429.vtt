00:00:01.679 --> 00:00:09.839
At Saccharinthians 1 and 3, Jehovah is described as the God of all comfort and God of tender

00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:11.640
mercies.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:16.960
And what is the biblical understanding of the word comfort in this context?

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:24.280
It literally means calling to one side, standing beside a person to encourage him when he's

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.960
going through a very difficult time.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.239
One Bible scholar described comfort this way.

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:34.920
The word always means more than soothing sympathy.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.320
The Christian comfort is that which brings courage and enables a man to cope with all that

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.799
life can do to him.

00:00:43.799 --> 00:00:46.520
And that describes Jehovah, doesn't it?

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.039
He's also called the Father of tender mercies, and that expression tender mercies means to

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:57.159
feel pity and cares very much.

00:00:57.159 --> 00:01:01.960
And Jehovah is the source of heartfelt pity and care.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.760
Now, just illustrate that.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.480
Let's open our Bibles to Psalm 23 and look at verse 1.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:15.719
And notice how Jehovah is always there standing beside as a caring shepherd.

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:20.120
Psalm 23 1 says, Jehovah is my shepherd.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.480
I will lack nothing.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:29.200
So whatever life throws at us in line with the word of comfort, Jehovah is there a caring

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.239
shepherd will provide what we need.

00:01:33.239 --> 00:01:38.920
And this expression shepherd is very fitting because the Middle Eastern shepherd cared

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.319
deeply for his sheep.

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:43.239
He would inspect them every day.

00:01:43.239 --> 00:01:44.200
He knew their names.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:51.319
And if you saw any indication of sickness or pain, he would treat it right away.

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:53.879
He would give the medicine if it was needed.

00:01:53.879 --> 00:01:57.200
And if they were too weak to stand up while they were ever recovering, he would actually

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:04.200
literally hold them up so that they would not lie down and die and give up.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.519
Well, Jehovah is there for us, isn't he?

00:02:06.519 --> 00:02:11.800
When we go through difficulties and we just feel like lying down, he's there to carry

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.199
the load for us and to prop us up as a caring shepherd.

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:24.080
And this concept of having what we need is also highlighted at 2 Timothy chapter 3 verses

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.319
16 and 17.

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:32.039
Paul under inspiration is talking about the inspired scriptures and how beneficial they are.

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:38.319
And what is the result of one taking advantage of the comfort Jehovah gives through the scriptures?

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:45.520
It says so that the man of God may be fully competent, completely equipped for every

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.120
good work.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:53.960
And we might add not only every good work, but everything that life may bring upon us.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:59.639
That expression completely equipped literally means having been fitted out.

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:05.240
And sometimes it was used to describe a boat that was completely outfitted with everything

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:09.039
that was needed for a successful voyage.

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:14.560
Or it may refer to a machine that was always able to live up to what it was designed

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.719
to do.

00:03:16.719 --> 00:03:24.479
So Jehovah always gives us what we need regardless of the nature of the stress or strain.

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:30.680
Now just to use one illustration of how Jehovah's Word can help us, it's like Jehovah

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.159
standing by us to prop us up.

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:37.840
Let's talk about something that can be very emotionally draining and very difficult

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.080
to deal with, and that's loneliness.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:49.240
loneliness is longing to be loved by someone, to be understood, to feel needed and wanted,

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.240
appreciated.

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:57.039
And when those things are not met, a person can feel very empty inside.

00:03:57.039 --> 00:04:03.139
Now being alone is not the same as loneliness, is it?

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:08.300
Being alone is a state of a geographic situation.

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:14.659
This is an emotional condition, because some of the loneliest people in the world are

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:17.660
surrounded by millions in large cities.

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:22.379
So it's not just having people around, and there has to be a connection there.

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:24.259
There has to be more than just people.

00:04:24.259 --> 00:04:32.660
Well, notice the words of Psalm 88, or rather, 68 verse 6, that shows what Jehovah does for

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:36.180
those who may be experiencing loneliness.

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:44.819
The first part of Psalm 68 verse 6 says, God gives those who are alone a home to dwell

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:46.300
in.

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:52.980
Now we notice here, he didn't say in this case, he gives him a house, a shelter, a cover,

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:57.620
it's true, Jehovah does that, but a home conveys much more, doesn't it?

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:02.860
A home is a place where we have family members that get along, work together, play together.

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.740
There's a united sense of belonging.

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:10.500
They feel needed, wanted, and appreciated when there's a happy family life.

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:15.740
And these joyful relationships become the cure to loneliness.

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:22.259
Now, just to illustrate that point, one of our sisters, as reported on in our public

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:30.980
watchtower, number one edition, 2018, had suffered many losses, and she said she felt very alone.

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:36.579
But then she considered the very text we've just read at Psalm 68 verse 6, and notice what

00:05:36.579 --> 00:05:44.180
she said, I knew that the verse could not just mean a home in a physical sense now.

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:49.540
Rather, I came to understand that God offers us a spiritual home, a place of real safety

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:56.060
that provides genuine connections and emotional attachment to others who love Jehovah.

00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:03.779
So Jehovah gave her a home, not just a house, gave her a home with relationships and people

00:06:03.779 --> 00:06:07.899
that cared about her, and she felt less lonely.

00:06:07.899 --> 00:06:10.420
But Jehovah provides that, doesn't he?

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:15.420
Now, in line with that same thought, let's open our Bibles to Mark chapter 10, Mark

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:21.860
chapter 10, and we'll see again the difference between a house and relationships.

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:30.579
From Mark chapter 10, Jesus is talking about this matter of a person leading the possessions,

00:06:30.579 --> 00:06:35.819
houses, family, for the sake of the good news.

00:06:35.819 --> 00:06:38.139
And so what does he say about that?

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:45.379
Well, in verse 29, he says this of Mark 10, truly I say to you, no one who has left

00:06:45.379 --> 00:06:53.620
a house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children.

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:59.540
So he distinguishes between a house and relationships.

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:04.860
And he says that in imitation of his father, he's going to make sure that those who become

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:07.980
isolated or give up things, or what are they going to get?

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:15.300
Verse 30, a hundred times more now, not just in a house, but brothers, sisters, mothers

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:16.939
and children.

00:07:16.939 --> 00:07:22.420
The loneliness factor is addressed within the arrangements and provisions that come from

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:26.500
serving Jehovah and being a disciple of Christ.

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:31.220
So how good it is for us to remember that we can imitate Jehovah.

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:35.459
And even though we're surrounded by many people here, in our Bethel family and in our other

00:07:35.459 --> 00:07:40.660
assignments, we always want to make sure that it's not just being around a lot of people,

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:47.019
we're doing what we can like Jehovah to stand beside comfort, show that we really care

00:07:47.019 --> 00:07:52.579
and help them to get away from any feelings of loneliness that they may be experiencing.

00:07:52.579 --> 00:07:57.420
Well, one caution we'd like to mention in the conclusion of our little discussion this

00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:05.620
morning is the fact that we have to be careful that we don't default to false comforters.

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:07.220
We have the best comforters, don't we?

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:08.660
We have Jehovah.

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:10.459
We have Christ Jesus.

00:08:10.459 --> 00:08:14.899
We have a loving brotherhood, but sometimes when a person is going through stress or

00:08:14.899 --> 00:08:21.819
loneliness of other trials, false comforters can make matters worse.

00:08:21.819 --> 00:08:26.300
Remember how Jehovah described his so-called friends who came to comfort him and all of

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:28.019
his trials?

00:08:28.019 --> 00:08:33.779
In Job 162, he said, all of you are troublesome comforters.

00:08:33.779 --> 00:08:38.299
And in Job 134, he said, you are useless physicians.

00:08:38.299 --> 00:08:39.299
They weren't helping a bit.

00:08:39.299 --> 00:08:45.379
In fact, they made his situation worse because because of the things he said and their attitude

00:08:45.379 --> 00:08:50.940
to word joke, brought out some of them, not so good points in Job, they made his situation

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:52.100
worse.

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:58.899
Well, what could be like a false comforter today, useless troublesome?

00:08:58.899 --> 00:09:04.580
Well, sometimes people will turn to an escape route.

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:09.940
If they're not careful, they'll turn to a false comforter in the form of overindulgence

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:17.179
or the misuse, the immoderate use of alcohol, trying to just escape what they may be feeling

00:09:17.179 --> 00:09:19.740
or experiencing.

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:26.019
Sometimes people will escape by means of fantasizing about things that are totally improper, thinking

00:09:26.019 --> 00:09:30.340
I'll escape and provide some relief, but it makes things worse, doesn't it?

00:09:31.059 --> 00:09:36.700
Or our person may be discouraged and resort to some old weakness of the flesh, thinking

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:42.139
that a temporary moment of pleasure might make them feel better.

00:09:42.139 --> 00:09:45.419
But all those things are not true comforters, are they?

00:09:45.419 --> 00:09:46.740
They make matters worse.

00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:50.379
They create the need for more comforters.

00:09:50.379 --> 00:09:56.059
So in imitation of Jehovah, may we do what we can to comfort others, but may we always

00:09:56.059 --> 00:10:00.659
remember our comforter is our loving creator, the father of tender mercies, the God of

00:10:00.659 --> 00:10:04.940
all Comfort, who helps us to cope with whatever life throws at us.
