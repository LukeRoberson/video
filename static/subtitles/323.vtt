00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:05.040
What does the master expect from us?

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.039
In Jesus' prophecy about the conclusion of the system of things,

00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:15.039
he not only gives us signs as to when the end would be close.

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:24.039
He also gives us pointed advice and counsel on how to be prepared and ready for Jehovah's Day.

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:29.039
What does the master expect from us when he comes?

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:36.039
Now we look at our text for today here on Matthew 24, verse 33.

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:46.740
Jesus says likewise also you when you see all these things.

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.740
So obviously this applies to the anointed.

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:55.740
And the parables throughout Matthew 24 and 25 apply to the anointed.

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:59.740
Of course those of the other sheep can benefit greatly from the advice

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:04.739
because it will help them also to be in a state of preparedness

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.739
and to be acceptable to the master.

00:01:07.739 --> 00:01:10.739
Now he says here in our text,

00:01:10.739 --> 00:01:14.739
know that he is near at the doors.

00:01:14.739 --> 00:01:18.739
So when I see all these things, they will know.

00:01:18.739 --> 00:01:20.739
His coming is imminent.

00:01:21.739 --> 00:01:27.739
They will know that he is there to visit them and to take them.

00:01:27.739 --> 00:01:35.340
Now they are not afraid of this event because they love their master

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.340
and their master has taught them what they need to do to be acceptable

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.340
and they are determined to live up to those requirements.

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:51.620
What we would like to do now is focus on two of the lessons Jesus gave

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.620
these apostles during this prophecy.

00:01:54.620 --> 00:02:02.620
And the first one we would like to look at just very briefly is in Matthew 24 and verse 42.

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:07.620
It says keep on the watch.

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.620
And the second one is in verse 44.

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.620
It says prove yourselves ready.

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.620
Now these two work hand in hand with each other

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:28.620
and they are highlighted in Matthew 25 with the parable of the discrete virgins.

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.620
They kept on the watch by keeping their lamps burning

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:38.620
and they proved themselves ready by having additional oil for their lamps.

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.620
But now for us, how does that apply to us?

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.620
How do we do these two things?

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.620
Keep on the watch and prove ourselves ready.

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.620
Let's talk about the first one, keeping on the watch.

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.620
Now it is not possible to stay awake day after day, week after week.

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.620
So this is not a physical requirement.

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.620
It is much deeper.

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.620
It speaks about our attitude.

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.620
How do we feel on the inside?

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:11.620
Our inner response, do we really believe the master is coming?

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.620
Our convictions, do we know that this is the truth?

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.620
And the work we do is of utmost importance.

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:31.620
Our commitment to review people as precious to God and help them to come into a close relationship with Jehovah.

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:38.620
So our attitude is summarized by this expression keep on the watch.

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.620
As for the second one, prove yourselves ready.

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.620
Now this refers more to our actions.

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.620
We prove that we are ready.

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:53.620
For example, a man tells a woman he loves her.

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.620
That he will be loyal to her forever.

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.620
He marries her.

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.620
Does that prove his love?

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.620
Not totally.

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:11.620
He proves his love by loyalty sticking to her through the ups and downs of life.

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:16.620
So how do we prove that we are ready?

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.620
We prove it by our commitment.

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.620
Do we have enough oil?

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:23.620
Do we let our light shine?

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.620
Do we preach at every opportunity?

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:32.620
Do we relentlessly search for the sheep and spare no effort,

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:39.620
even make major sacrifices to help other people learn about Jehovah?

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:46.620
So these two aspects of Jesus gave us advice on very important our attitude and our actions.

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.620
These two need to come together.

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.620
Now there's a warning in this prophecy also given by Jesus.

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:59.620
Do not think for a moment that the end is far off.

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:04.620
It's an excellent principle in Ecclesiastes 11 verse 4

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.620
that shows how attitude and action work together

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:13.620
and how we need to view matters from Jehovah's perspective.

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.620
Ecclesiastes 11 verse 4.

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:20.339
It says,

00:05:20.339 --> 00:05:24.339
the one who watches the wind will not so seed

00:05:24.339 --> 00:05:27.339
and the one who looks at the clouds will not reap.

00:05:27.339 --> 00:05:29.339
So when a person looks at the wind,

00:05:29.339 --> 00:05:31.339
he says, oh, my seed is going to blow away.

00:05:31.339 --> 00:05:33.339
It's no point sewing today.

00:05:33.339 --> 00:05:36.339
Or if he watches the clouds,

00:05:36.339 --> 00:05:39.339
he's going to say, well, it looks like it's going to rain.

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:44.339
If I bring the harvest in now, it will get wet before I have time to put it in the storehouse

00:05:44.339 --> 00:05:48.339
so I don't think I will be reaping today.

00:05:48.339 --> 00:05:50.339
Now this has applied to us.

00:05:50.339 --> 00:05:55.339
While we have work to do, we have much work in the harvest to do.

00:05:55.339 --> 00:06:00.339
We cannot second guess when the master will come.

00:06:00.339 --> 00:06:02.339
He's given us work to do.

00:06:02.339 --> 00:06:07.339
It's our responsibility to do the work.

00:06:07.339 --> 00:06:14.339
It is his responsibility to look after the weather as to when the time will come.

00:06:14.339 --> 00:06:18.339
Do we really focus on that assignment we have to do?

00:06:18.339 --> 00:06:23.339
If we try to calculate exactly the moment when Christ will come,

00:06:23.339 --> 00:06:28.339
it will debilitate our efforts because Christ said, you know neither the hour.

00:06:28.339 --> 00:06:32.339
And at an hour you do not think to be it, he will come.

00:06:32.339 --> 00:06:34.339
And we have work to do.

00:06:34.339 --> 00:06:36.339
We're not on with our work.

00:06:36.339 --> 00:06:38.339
We know how to do it.

00:06:38.339 --> 00:06:40.339
We know what we must do.

00:06:40.339 --> 00:06:43.339
We work along with a faithful and discreet slave

00:06:43.339 --> 00:06:46.339
and who can ask for better companions.

00:06:46.339 --> 00:06:50.339
So the two lessons, keep on the watch

00:06:50.339 --> 00:06:53.339
and prove yourselves ready.

00:06:53.339 --> 00:06:59.339
Are very important for us if we want to gain the pleasure and the approval of our master.

00:06:59.339 --> 00:07:03.339
Do not allow anything to get in the way.

00:07:03.339 --> 00:07:07.339
Carefully examine our own personal attitude.

00:07:07.339 --> 00:07:10.339
Let us prioritize the preaching work.

00:07:10.339 --> 00:07:12.339
Spare no effort.

00:07:12.339 --> 00:07:18.339
Do not allow Satan and his schemes, his ideas to distract us.

00:07:18.339 --> 00:07:24.339
Remember, no one can prove our loyalty to Jehovah for us.

00:07:24.339 --> 00:07:27.339
That is something only we can do.

00:07:27.339 --> 00:07:32.339
And Jehovah, the judge of all the earth, can read hearts.
