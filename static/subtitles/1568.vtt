WEBVTT

00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:08.939
We all have an important reason to act safely.

00:00:08.939 --> 00:00:11.939
Act 1728 reads,

00:00:11.939 --> 00:00:16.940
for by him we have life and move and exist.

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:20.940
Since life is such a precious gift from Jehovah,

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.940
safety and the sanctity of life must be a priority in our daily lives.

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.940
Our organization has a goal of zero accidents

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.939
and not just on construction projects,

00:00:32.939 --> 00:00:38.939
being safety conscious is a lifestyle that affects all we do,

00:00:38.939 --> 00:00:43.939
whether we're at home on the road or on theocratic projects.

00:00:43.939 --> 00:00:48.939
Our attitude towards safety is really a reflection of our spirituality

00:00:48.939 --> 00:00:52.939
and our love for Jehovah and the brothers and sisters.

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:55.939
Let's see a few dramatizations from around the world

00:00:55.939 --> 00:01:00.939
to help us see how we can all be more safety conscious.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.420
That day changed everything.

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:10.419
In that moment, I realized that my actions could have injured someone.

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:13.419
I could even have become blood guilty.

00:02:13.419 --> 00:02:19.840
My problem was overconfidence.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:30.379
I never had a car accident and I thought it could never happen to me.

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:36.849
But just a second of distracted driving can kill.

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:40.849
I meditated on Psalm 36.9.

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:43.849
With you is a source of life.

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:46.849
By your light, we can see light.

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:50.849
My love for Jehovah, the source of life,

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:55.849
now affects how I drive and even my approach to other activities.

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:58.849
For example, I love sports,

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:02.849
but I stop playing those with a high potential for serious injury

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:04.849
and even relatively safe ones.

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:22.099
I'm committed to enjoying in the safest way possible.

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:27.099
I think Jehovah every day I'm still alive.

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:29.099
It was such a close call.

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:33.099
It was a street I've walked across hundreds of times.

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:38.099
No one has ever been hurt there before, so I felt safe.

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:42.099
Besides, I was preoccupied with what I had to do that day.

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:47.439
I didn't see the car until I heard this screeching tires.

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:55.629
I wish I hadn't taken this to become more safety conscious.

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:59.629
But now we continually train our children to stop, think,

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:18.329
and evaluate even familiar surroundings before proceeding.

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:23.329
Acting safely is one way we showed Jehovah how much we appreciate life.

00:04:23.329 --> 00:04:39.949
Whether at home or elsewhere, being safe has become a lifestyle for us.

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:45.949
As a body of elders, we take Proverbs 22 verse 3 seriously.

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:49.949
The shrewd one sees the danger and conceals himself,

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:54.949
but that inexperience keeps right on going and suffer the consequences.

00:04:54.949 --> 00:05:02.839
If we take short cut or permit something unsafe and an accident happens,

00:05:02.839 --> 00:05:07.839
we bear a measure of responsibility of the results.

00:05:07.839 --> 00:05:20.079
We love Jehovah and our brothers and sisters too much to allow that.

00:05:20.079 --> 00:05:48.819
With good direction and training from the LDC maintenance training team,

00:05:48.819 --> 00:05:53.819
we've learned to apply the principle of Proverbs 22 verse 3.

00:05:53.819 --> 00:06:00.819
We identify potential risks before we start working and make a plan to complete it safely.

00:06:00.819 --> 00:06:06.459
We always assign the right person to a task,

00:06:06.459 --> 00:06:12.459
a way of everyone's knowledge, limitations, and abilities.

00:06:12.459 --> 00:06:16.459
And while it's wonderful to have young ones with us,

00:06:16.459 --> 00:06:21.459
we make sure they are always supervised and work with either their parents

00:06:21.459 --> 00:06:46.920
or another responsible person.

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:51.920
Before a convention, everyone's excited to help set up and time is short,

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:55.920
but we never rush work at the expensive safety.

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:58.920
Again, planning ahead is key.

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:02.920
Even if we've never been injured and nothing happens this time,

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:05.920
if we take chances, what example are we setting?

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:11.920
When we take our time, plan ahead, and focus on the task at hand,

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:15.920
we follow the advice of Proverbs 3, 21 and 23.

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:19.920
Safeguard practical wisdom and thinking ability.

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:22.920
Then you will walk on your way in safety.

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:28.920
And this principle of walking on your way in safety doesn't end when the convention begins.

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:31.920
Often we're excited to see our friends,

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:35.920
and we forget to pay attention to where we're physically walking.

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:40.920
We need to use extra caution in locations like high traffic areas,

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:45.920
stairs, escalators, parking lots, our accommodations,

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:49.920
and other areas that could have potential trip hazards.

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:53.920
Even our choice of shoes could pose a risk.

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:58.920
Every year high heel shoes cause a number of serious accidents.

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:11.139
In our personal study, we realize there's a direct link between

00:08:11.139 --> 00:08:15.139
identifying spiritual dangers and physical ones.

00:08:15.139 --> 00:08:20.139
Wanting to always give Jehovah our best motivates us to stop and analyze situations

00:08:20.139 --> 00:08:27.579
before starting a task.

00:08:27.579 --> 00:08:30.579
I've learned that when evaluating possible hazards,

00:08:30.579 --> 00:08:39.000
we should be based on love for Jehovah and others.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
This helps me to always choose the safe way,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000
even if it's more time consuming or expensive.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
There is a key phrase from our training that goes,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000
if we see something unsafe, say something immediately.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000
This is in line with the principle of Philippians 2.4 that says,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
as you look out not only for your own interests,

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.279
but also for the interests of others.

00:09:04.279 --> 00:09:07.279
By speaking up and helping one see potential risks,

00:09:07.279 --> 00:09:09.279
we can prevent accidents.

00:09:09.279 --> 00:09:23.350
Life is a gift from Jehovah.

00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:27.350
And I want to train my children to value it.

00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:31.350
The smallest actions can save lives.

00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:41.809
My conscience is clean now.

00:09:41.809 --> 00:09:46.809
Understanding that making safety a priority is an expression of my love for Jehovah

00:09:46.809 --> 00:09:48.809
and my brothers and sisters.

00:09:48.809 --> 00:09:52.820
I'm happier now.

00:09:52.820 --> 00:10:21.379
Could it be that some of our actions reveal a lack of appreciation for the gift of life?

00:10:21.379 --> 00:10:26.379
As was mentioned, safety is part of being spiritual people.

00:10:26.379 --> 00:10:32.379
That understanding motivates us to develop safer routines and ways of doing things.

00:10:32.379 --> 00:10:37.379
Our minds will be focused on keeping us safe by identifying

00:10:37.379 --> 00:10:41.379
risk and adjusting how we do things.

00:10:41.379 --> 00:10:46.379
This way we stay safe by eliminating or controlling the risks.

00:10:46.379 --> 00:10:51.379
The world focuses on speed and cutting corners to get things done.

00:10:51.379 --> 00:10:55.379
In contrast, we want our theocratic and personal activities

00:10:55.379 --> 00:10:59.379
to show that safety is a priority.

00:10:59.379 --> 00:11:05.379
This can be accomplished if we view safety as a reflection of our love for Jehovah

00:11:05.379 --> 00:11:08.379
and his precious gift of life.
