WEBVTT

00:00:01.419 --> 00:00:08.730
The first rodeo I performed in front of an audience that was eight years old.

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:21.989
We were considered one of the top two acts in rodeo.

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:26.989
My strength lied in my fearlessness.

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:35.630
Even though there was a certain amount of excitement,

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:40.630
it was fun to travel, to be together as a family,

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:43.630
it was empty.

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:53.079
Trickriding is like gymnastics on the back of a running horse.

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:55.079
We've had horses all of our life.

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.079
My father specialized in training courses.

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:04.079
He used to send us to the mountains riding all day long.

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:11.060
And then we'd come home in the evening and we would start trickriding.

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.060
The way we learned was by a book.

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.060
We looked at stick pictures that showed how it should be done

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.060
and so it was trial and error.

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.060
At the same time that we were learning our horses were learning.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.060
The horse that I rode just let me do anything.

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.060
My horse's name was Sweetlips.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.060
I was eight when I got him and I named him myself.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.060
He was like my best friend.

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.060
My parents were very active in the rodeo as competitors.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.060
My mom was bell racing.

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.060
My father was saddle-brunk rider.

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.060
I grew up as one of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.060
But when I was very young, maybe six or seven,

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.060
my father stopped serving Jehovah.

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.060
To be honest with you when they announced that at the Kingdom Hall,

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.060
it really didn't have much meaning to me at the time.

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.060
I didn't know what it meant.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.060
And I could see people crying and so I cried.

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.060
But I didn't really understand it.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:17.060
Really from that point our family was not active as Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.060
I grew up on the road traveling, rodeo to rodeo,

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.060
from coast to coast, and from the south to the north,

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.060
as far as the roads go.

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.060
The four of us rode initially, Connie Kelly,

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.060
myself and my brother Jim,

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.060
our family traveled together.

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.060
That meant a lot to me.

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.060
What separated us from the others at the time

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.060
was the high speed that we did it at.

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.060
And also the difficulty with the tricks that we chose to do.

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.060
People were very excited.

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.060
They would hire us back at the same place year after year.

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:01.060
Throughout all that time, we did not miss one memorial.

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.060
We were always there. There was something in us.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.060
We didn't know it when we were little,

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:12.060
but my parents had succeeded in planting the truth in our hearts.

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.060
My link to the truth was my grandmother.

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.060
I can remember going to the ranch and visiting her.

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.060
She was very busy, but one thing that really sticks in my mind

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.060
is she always studied every day.

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.060
She read her Bible. Her magazines were studied.

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.060
And I think it just put a seed in there

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.060
that later on started to grow.

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.060
I just felt like I needed direction.

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.060
It's like a line was drawn in the sand.

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.060
Take one path or the other.

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.060
And so ironically, the first book that I picked up to read

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.060
was the Bible.

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.060
One of the scriptures that probably meant the most to me

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.060
was Proverbs 35 and 6.

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.060
Trust in Jehovah with all your heart

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.060
and do not lean upon your own understanding

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.060
and all your ways, take notice of him

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.060
and he himself will make your path straight.

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.060
I used to think about those words

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.060
and what I would have to do to live up to them.

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.060
Although we traveled with the rodeo about ten months out of the year,

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.060
we did go to the district convention

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.060
and the live forever book came out.

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:30.060
And there just came a time when I knew I need to make changes.

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.060
Sister started studying with me

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.060
and as I started reading the Bible for myself and studying,

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.060
then Jehovah became Marielle.

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.060
All it took was one or two people in the whole family

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:48.060
followed my father to return to the truth.

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.060
Trick writing was our family business.

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.060
It was our livelihood.

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.060
But we had decided that we were done.

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.060
We were going to stop.

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.060
With that decision would come

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:01.060
giving up everything we knew.

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:08.060
I think the most difficult thing for me to do was to sell the horse.

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:12.060
You just get such a close bond with them

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:17.060
when you're putting your life in their hands like that.

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.060
But I was willing to do that.

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:21.060
I knew what I wanted to do.

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:22.060
I did it.

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:28.430
I got baptized in October of 85.

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:31.430
Our last performance was in February of 86.

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:33.430
We just finished out our contracts.

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:37.430
I started pioneering in September of 86

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:39.430
and I've never stopped.

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:42.430
I also married a man who loves Jehovah.

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:46.430
We've had the privilege of working on international construction projects.

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:48.430
We went to Mexico.

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:50.430
We went to Venezuela.

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:52.430
My father's an elder.

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:54.430
My mom's pioneering.

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:58.430
In fact, all of my siblings have been able to regular pioneer

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:00.430
at some point in their lives.

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:03.430
We're presently in the circuit work.

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:06.430
Serving Jehovah together is such a blessing.

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:12.430
Everything that we do every day is for Jehovah.

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:16.430
That's what I wanted to do when I made this decision.

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:21.930
If I would have taken that other path when I was young,

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:24.930
it may not be a life today.

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:27.930
What I did was dangerous.

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:29.930
Even fame and fortune in the world.

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:31.930
There's nothing there.

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:32.930
I wanted the real life.

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:34.930
I wanted to serve Jehovah.

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:40.389
I have no regrets.

00:06:40.389 --> 00:06:42.389
If I could change anything,

00:06:42.389 --> 00:06:45.389
when it comes to my service to Jehovah,

00:06:45.389 --> 00:06:47.389
I would change nothing.

00:06:47.389 --> 00:06:49.389
I would just do it better.
