00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:07.000
Welcome. We have some exciting things to share with you in this update. I'm sure you'll

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.880
find it very encouraging. This month makes the 10-year anniversary of the release of the

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:20.640
revised English New World Translation at the annual meeting in 2013. That historic

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:28.879
program was streamed to 31 lands and over 1.4 million attended in person or via internet

00:00:28.879 --> 00:00:37.719
stream. The complete New World Translation is now available in 158 languages, but if

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:43.280
we take into consideration those languages that have the complete Christian Greek Scriptures

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:53.759
or part of the Christian Greek Scriptures, that brings the total to 279 languages. We've

00:00:53.759 --> 00:00:59.600
found this revision to be so helpful in our ministry, haven't we? And now the governing

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:06.040
body has approved of adding yet another tool to help us quickly access the powerful message

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:14.400
in the Bible. We all believe in the power of God's Word to give us comfort and guidance.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:22.000
Because of that, we have our favorite Scriptures that we refer to over and over again. However,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.719
do you ever partially remember a Bible verse but you're not sure where to find it? I know

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:35.280
that happens to me. Or do you want to comfort someone with a verse that perhaps they don't

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:44.159
often hear? If so, you'll be pleased to know that a new tool is being released. It has

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:53.840
the title Scriptures for Christian Living. This publication is similar in a number of ways

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:01.519
to one that was released back in 1965. The book makes sure of all things hold fast to what

00:02:01.519 --> 00:02:09.759
is fine. The title page described that book as a compilation of Scriptures from the Holy Bible

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:16.879
under 123 main headings. Its purpose? The title page said,

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:24.000
this book may be used to assure yourself of the Bible teaching on these subjects and also

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:32.400
to answer those who challenge your faith. Make sure was a well-loved publication. Notice what

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:41.439
two publishers enjoyed about it. I love this book. It's comprehensive lists of Scriptures under

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:49.039
topics ranging from angels to work, helped me to understand and identify important Bible principles.

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:54.159
Well, when the make sure book came out, we were pioneering in the Bible belt,

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:59.520
where we often had doctrinal discussions. I remember one time talking with a woman,

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:05.680
and she brought up the rich man in Lazarus. So, we went to that section in the make sure book

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:12.830
on Hellfire, and we were able to reason with her on the matter. I was in the Air Force when I got

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:19.310
the truth, and so this book helped me to understand a lot more clearly issues relating to war,

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:25.789
neutrality, and friendship with the world. To this star, keep my copy handy. I would say that

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.509
it was a teaching tool of the time, and as pioneers, we never have come without it.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:38.719
Like the make sure book, which is no longer available in print, the new publication,

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:44.960
Scriptures for Christian Living, is a compilation of Scriptures on more than 100 topics.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:53.199
The purpose of this publication is to help us, as we're instructed at 2nd Timothy 2.15,

00:03:53.199 --> 00:04:01.120
that is, to handle the word of truth or right. Let's briefly outline key features of this new

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:09.680
publication using JW Library. Scriptures for Christian Living, which were referred to as SCL,

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:16.240
makes it easy to locate Bible verses and accounts to help you deal with challenges and to encourage

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:24.160
others. It doesn't list all the Scriptures on a given topic, instead it groups the various

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:33.199
subjects by category. To find a subject, use the search box in JW Library, or browse the categories.

00:04:34.319 --> 00:04:43.199
SCL is divided into seven categories, challenges, conduct, congregation, daily life,

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:53.040
family, spirituality, and qualities. Select a category and then scroll down the list of topics.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:59.519
If you're not sure which category might have the subject you're looking for, select all.

00:05:01.439 --> 00:05:08.079
Many of the subjects have these features. Under each topic, you'll see a number of statements or

00:05:08.079 --> 00:05:14.319
questions involved. Decided verses support this statement or answer the question.

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:21.839
In some cases, there are see also verses or relevant Bible accounts listed.

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:30.879
How can the SCL be used? Unlike the make sure book, which was designed primarily for use in the

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:38.800
field ministry, SCL is designed to guide us as we face the challenges of living us through Christians.

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:47.120
Elders, you'll find this new publication to be a valuable resource on shepherding calls

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:54.800
and when developing talks. Family heads, you may want to use the material as a basis for some

00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:01.439
of your family worship sessions. In congregation publishers, you can use this material

00:06:01.439 --> 00:06:08.639
not only as a basis for some personal Bible study projects, but also to help your Bible students

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:18.800
learn and apply Bible principles when making decisions. SCL has been approved in over 300 languages.

00:06:19.439 --> 00:06:28.160
How can you get a copy? And the big question, when can you get a copy? We're happy to inform you

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:37.920
that SCL is now available in JW Library and will later be available in print. For a period of time,

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:47.439
SCL will be available in what's new. And you'll also be able to find by selecting the library option

00:06:47.519 --> 00:06:55.579
at the bottom of the screen and then selecting books. Some languages will be available at the same

00:06:55.579 --> 00:07:03.500
time as English, with more languages to follow. It's the governing body's hope that scriptures

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:11.740
for Christian living will help all of us to do a second Timothy 3.17 says, and use God's word

00:07:11.819 --> 00:07:16.860
to become fully competent, completely equipped for every good work.

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:24.699
This is especially important as we get deeper into the last days.

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:35.100
Have you ever been afraid during the past few years? Afraid you'd get sick? Afraid you'd lose your

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:43.420
job? Afraid you wouldn't be able to feed your family? Maybe you faced a natural disaster,

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:51.019
persecution or war? For what seems like an eternity you've been living with fear?

00:07:52.459 --> 00:08:01.500
If so, what does it mean? Does being afraid indicate a lack of faith? Not at all.

00:08:02.459 --> 00:08:08.300
Faithful men of the past have been afraid at times. Take David, for example.

00:08:09.339 --> 00:08:16.779
King Saul had put a price on David's head. As a result, no place in Israel was safe for David,

00:08:16.779 --> 00:08:25.899
so he decided to leave the country. Where do you go? To gas the hometown of Goliath?

00:08:27.019 --> 00:08:30.699
Well, as you can imagine, David wasn't very popular there.

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:39.580
As a result, the Bible says that David became very much afraid of King Akish of Gath.

00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:47.259
It was during that dangerous time in David's life that he composed the 56th Psalm.

00:08:48.779 --> 00:08:56.909
Let's look at a few verses, starting with verse 1. Show me favor or God,

00:08:57.470 --> 00:09:06.669
because mortal man is attacking me. Now, that's good to remember. No matter how powerful a ruler

00:09:06.669 --> 00:09:17.149
may seem to be, he is still a mortal man. He needs water and food to live. All Jehovah has to do

00:09:17.789 --> 00:09:28.379
is to take that away, and that man is a goner. Now, let's look at verse 8. David says,

00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:38.460
you keep track of my wandering. No matter where David went, he was never out of Jehovah's side.

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:48.860
Then he continues, do collect my tears in your skin bottle? Are they not recorded in your book?

00:09:50.299 --> 00:09:56.299
David, that courageous warrior was an embarrassed to admit that he shed tears at times,

00:09:57.019 --> 00:10:04.860
that he was afraid at times. Still, David didn't allow himself to be overwhelmed by grief.

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:13.019
He was confident that Jehovah noticed his tears, and that God understood the reason why David was

00:10:13.019 --> 00:10:21.419
crying. It's as if his tears were recorded in a book. David was sure that one day that book would

00:10:21.419 --> 00:10:29.580
be opened, and Jehovah would repay the men who had made David cry. Isn't it reassuring to

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:37.379
know that Jehovah is not indifferent to our tears when you get into a difficult situation?

00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:47.539
Pray. If there's something you can do about it, pray for wisdom. If there's nothing you can do

00:10:47.539 --> 00:10:57.779
about it, pray for peace. When a situation arises that makes us fearful, remember, we have a secret

00:10:57.779 --> 00:11:08.580
weapon. It's a powerful weapon. Prayer. If we pour out our hearts with Jehovah, he will listen to us,

00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:18.820
and he will help us. Now that brings us back to verse 3. It's a simple statement, but it's very

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:30.419
meaningful. When I am afraid, I put my trust in you. That's realistic. It acknowledges the fact

00:11:30.419 --> 00:11:37.779
that sometimes we're afraid, but it tells us what to do about it, to put our trust in Jehovah.

00:11:39.539 --> 00:11:45.700
Next year, we'll have many opportunities to meditate on that statement, because the governing

00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:57.779
body has chosen it as our year text for 2024. Once again, that's Psalm 56 verse 3. When I am afraid,

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:06.820
I put my trust in you. From the World Headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses, this is JW Broadcasting.
