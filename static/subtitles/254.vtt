00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:11.710
Well, the big day finally arrived after all those months of preparation. It was just as I imagined

00:00:12.689 --> 00:00:14.689
Or wait

00:00:14.689 --> 00:00:16.690
That's not me

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:27.460
That's me as I watched my sister get married that day

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:37.600
I couldn't help but think about my own future

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:48.469
When I began dating Shane

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.149
Everything was perfect

00:00:53.350 --> 00:01:18.150
We spent a lot of time talking on the phone

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:54.579
Everything just naturally seemed to click. I was convinced. He was the one

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:09.849
but

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:11.370
over time

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.370
I started to notice some things

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:28.139
I was starting to see patterns

00:02:51.780 --> 00:03:26.009
They didn't seem to be getting better. I wasn't even sure our goals were the same anymore

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:47.780
I felt alone

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:49.939
But thankfully I wasn't

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:00.169
My mom kindly asked how things were going

00:04:00.969 --> 00:04:02.810
So I told her

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.050
Maybe he's not the one I told her

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:11.210
I thought she was going to tell me which way I should go

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:13.849
But she didn't

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:19.529
Instead she reassured me that if he wasn't the one I was going to be okay

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.899
They reminded me about what Jesus said when building a tower

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:58.170
For example, who of you wanting to build a tower does not first sit down and calculate the expense to see if he has enough to complete

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:00.490
I

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:06.410
Realized that I was about to enter into a building project of my own my relationship with Shane

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:11.050
And I too needed to calculate the expense before I commit to it

00:05:12.329 --> 00:05:17.290
They encouraged me to talk to Shane and tell him about the things that were concerning me

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:32.730
So I did and my mom was right

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:35.290
I was okay

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:37.290
more than okay really

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:40.410
Shane and I decided it was best to break off the relationship

00:05:45.589 --> 00:05:50.149
And some years later I found someone that loved your hover as much as I do

00:05:53.819 --> 00:05:55.819
And I love him with my whole heart
