00:00:01.139 --> 00:00:09.740
Now, our text today really brings to our attention the close attention and affection that our

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:16.500
God Jehovah has for each of us, and especially when we're living under extreme or stressful

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.500
times.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:23.260
And this has really brought home to us the fact that under inspiration the Apostle Paul

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:30.140
was moved to write to the Ephesian congregation of these beautiful words of our text today.

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:31.820
And why?

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:37.899
Because that congregation was under an extreme amount of pressure from the world around them.

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:41.020
The city of Ephesus was very materialistic.

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:48.060
It was wealthy and it was just steeped in spiritism and demonism.

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:53.579
The culture was based upon the religion of false gods such as Artemis.

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.780
In fact, they boasted that the great temple of Artemis was in Ephesus, which is considered

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.659
to be one of the seven wonders of the ancient world.

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:09.219
And so Ephesus was a tourist destination, and many made their wealth and money from

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:16.180
selling religious articles such as idols to those that would come there to worship.

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.140
This type of worship fostered immorality and crime.

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:25.819
Since within that temple arrangement no one could be charged with any kind of crime.

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:30.459
And of course it fostered immoral thinking and activities.

00:01:30.459 --> 00:01:37.099
So anytime our brothers went out to work, school, they were faced or dealing with this intense

00:01:37.099 --> 00:01:43.379
pressure from a culture that was in sharp contrast to doing God's will.

00:01:43.379 --> 00:01:50.340
They stood to danger of violating or having their Christian integrity compromised.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.019
When now this all sounds very familiar to us because we are living deep in the time of

00:01:54.019 --> 00:01:55.019
the end.

00:01:55.019 --> 00:01:59.019
In fact, the world is in an Ephesus-like condition, in fact even worse, because the devil

00:01:59.019 --> 00:02:01.859
has come down to the earth having great anger.

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:07.099
And he wants to destroy us all, especially we who are God's people.

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:11.979
So therefore we need to pay very close attention to the counsel, the loving counsel that

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:18.099
Jehovah gave to the Ephesians, and he preserved them for our day because we need to pay close

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:24.819
attention to what Jehovah told the Ephesians to preserve them alive during that time.

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:29.259
Here's their spiritual life and how important it is for us today.

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:33.900
Now in reviewing this counsel, if you may want to open your Bibles to Ephesians chapter

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:41.580
6, we definitely get the impression or the feel that this is a loving heavenly Father,

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.419
talking to his children.

00:02:44.419 --> 00:02:50.860
Notice right away in verse 11, what Jehovah tells all of us to do, he says to put on the

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:56.060
complete suit of armor from God so that you may be able to stand firm against the crafty

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.300
acts of the devil.

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.060
Now what does this sound like to you?

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.659
For me it reminds me of a parent talking to a child before he goes out and when the

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:10.099
weather is bad and he says put on your coat, in fact he helps him put on his coat, puts

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:14.819
a hat on his child and makes sure his gloves are on and puts his boots on.

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:20.620
And all the time talking, we want you to stay warm and safe and dry because I don't want

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.860
you to get sick, I want you to be safe and healthy.

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.979
And I can remember with my own mom when she would dress me up before I went out the door,

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:34.939
she would always slip some change in my pocket and I was back in the days of payphones.

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:39.900
And she says, you know, anytime you feel your stuck or you're in trouble, you give me

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:40.900
a call.

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.020
I'm just a phone call away.

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:50.180
When many ways Jehovah is like this loving parent, he dresses this up to face the

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:53.900
spiritual battles of our day.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:59.099
But he goes even further to show his personal concern and this is where our text for today

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:00.300
comes in.

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:07.219
In verse 18, it says, with every form of prayer and supplication you carry on prayer on

00:04:07.219 --> 00:04:11.740
every occasion in spirit.

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:16.139
Yes, the days are very wicked.

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:19.939
And Jehovah knows that there is things that we're going to be faced with that we need

00:04:19.939 --> 00:04:26.019
to talk to him about, but it's not just the things that are of great serious concern.

00:04:26.019 --> 00:04:33.660
Now, there are things that all things in life, he wants us to talk to him about.

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.620
And why is that?

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:40.259
It's interesting what the insight volume has to say, insight volume two under the subject

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:44.699
of prayer, talking about our personal prayers to Jehovah.

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:52.980
He made this comment, it says, personal prayers may embrace virtually every facet of life.

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:59.019
But for our prayers to be heard, we must be wholly on God's side of the issue involving

00:04:59.019 --> 00:05:01.379
Jehovah's sovereignty.

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:08.139
Now this isn't keeping with the spirit of the model prayer that Jesus taught us to pray.

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:14.259
Embodied in that prayer was all things that are important to a Christian's life.

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:17.699
And what is the foremost importance to us?

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:25.740
It's the sanctification of God's name, and that God's will be done by means of His kingdom.

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:33.660
As dedicated servants of Jehovah God, this is what our life is all about.

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:40.620
Our daily life is involved this matter of Jehovah's name and the kingdom.

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:45.500
It's tied up in our Christian integrity of upholding Jehovah's name and the kingdom

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:46.500
interests.

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:51.420
And that's why Jehovah says, pray on every occasion.

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:57.060
And what he's telling us is that everything in your life involves me.

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:59.699
I gave my son for you.

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:02.019
I want to hear what's going on in your life.

00:06:02.019 --> 00:06:04.500
I want to be a part of your life.

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:06.300
You are important to me.

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.019
You're my fellow worker.

00:06:08.019 --> 00:06:11.819
You're helping me accomplish my will and purpose.

00:06:11.819 --> 00:06:19.220
Therefore, we should never hold back from praying to Jehovah even about me, even minor

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:21.459
things that may come up.

00:06:21.459 --> 00:06:23.660
And why?

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:29.500
Because communication is a lifeblood of a strong relationship, especially with Jehovah

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:30.500
God.

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:33.540
Again, we go back to the illustration of children, you know, a child will sit there and

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:35.540
just talk and talk and talk and talk.

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:40.459
All about all kinds of things, maybe even seemingly insignificant things, but a parent

00:06:40.459 --> 00:06:43.259
listens to them with a smile on their face.

00:06:43.259 --> 00:06:48.300
They're overjoyed because they're hearing what the child thinks, what's on his heart.

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:53.819
But it also is an opportunity to establish good lines of communication with that child

00:06:53.819 --> 00:06:57.740
and establish a loving bond with him.

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:00.740
To hear his innermost thoughts.

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:04.060
Does Jehovah hear our innermost thoughts?

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:06.899
To hear times of joy.

00:07:06.899 --> 00:07:09.220
Why we're so happy?

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:15.860
Expressing gratitude for a beautiful day, a starry night, a shooting star, beavers on

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:17.540
the lake.

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:24.980
Such prayers are not just chatter to Jehovah God, but it's what endears us to him.

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:30.779
This establishes a strong line of communication with Jehovah God that we need during these

00:07:30.779 --> 00:07:34.620
critical last days.

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:41.500
Jesus says that every day we have anxieties and problems.

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:48.180
We have to deal with our own imperfect flesh that can cause us great distress among other

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:49.939
things.

00:07:49.939 --> 00:07:56.740
But notice what the sons of Coruscant and the book of the Psalms, 46 verse 1, under inspiration.

00:07:56.740 --> 00:08:02.060
Notice how they felt about Jehovah says, God is our refuge and strength, a help that

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:07.819
is readily found in times of distress.

00:08:07.819 --> 00:08:10.500
Times of distress we need to go to Jehovah God.

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:14.259
And if we've been talking to him about every little thing in our life, well, that line

00:08:14.259 --> 00:08:16.980
of communication is immediate.

00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:23.740
We go to him without hesitation, reveal to him what is causing us pain in our hearts,

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:28.459
our innermost thoughts, dealing with our imperfections in sinful nature.

00:08:28.459 --> 00:08:35.940
Now, this is where the Disciple James, in under inspiration, James 4.8, he tells us, during

00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:43.860
these times, is draw close to God and he will draw close to you.

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:46.940
Cleanse your hands, you sinners.

00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:51.100
We think we go back to the stress of our brothers in Ephesus.

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:53.620
They walked out the door and perhaps maybe they heard something.

00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:57.659
He saw something that brought back to their minds, an improper thought or a feeling that

00:08:57.659 --> 00:09:02.460
they thought they had licked, that they thought they had gotten control of.

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:06.059
And there it is, rearing as ugly head.

00:09:06.059 --> 00:09:09.580
They went to Jehovah in prayer, talked to him about that.

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:11.139
Does the same thing happen to us?

00:09:11.139 --> 00:09:13.019
Of course it does.

00:09:13.019 --> 00:09:14.460
We're imperfect.

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:19.100
Our hearts are always leaning towards what is bad.

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:23.580
And so we need to lean on Jehovah God to pray to him to let him know how we feel.

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:31.059
Express our thoughts so that we can bring every thought into captivity and make it obedient

00:09:31.059 --> 00:09:33.259
to the Christ.

00:09:33.259 --> 00:09:36.460
See, prayer can make that happen.

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:40.220
Jehovah can help us to remove those thoughts and bring them under the control so that they

00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:45.299
do not affect our peace and our joy in our heart.

00:09:45.299 --> 00:09:50.980
Jehovah truly is our loving Father and he's greatly concerned for each and every one of

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:51.980
us.

00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:53.340
And he wants to help us.

00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:58.460
He wants to be part of our life so that we can be successful in fighting the fine fight

00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:04.659
for the faith and maintaining our integrity to him each and every day.

00:10:04.659 --> 00:10:11.980
Therefore, let this day be another day in which our precious relationship with Jehovah God

00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:17.659
is strengthened because we have gone to him on every occasion in prayer.
