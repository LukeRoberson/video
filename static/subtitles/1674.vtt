You'll enjoy the true life experience of Jade Long, a sister who was raised in the truth but slowly drifted during her teenage years.

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:16.039
How was she helped to find her way back home?

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:35.979
As a high school senior, I started to grow friendlier with those that I went to school with, as well as those that I worked with, and started to lead a double life.

00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:50.979
As time went by, what I thought wouldn't affect me began to affect me, and my relationship with Jehovah wasn't as strong as it once was, and I was drifting away from the organization.

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:55.979
Within a matter of months I realized I wanted to leave home.

00:00:55.979 --> 00:01:04.980
I decided to relocate to Oregon, and this would mean supporting myself and doing things by myself for myself.

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:13.980
My relationship with Jehovah had already weakened to the point where I started an emotional relationship with a man who was not a witness.

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:23.980
Although it was emotional and not physical, it was a very serious relationship for me, where we got very close very fast.

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:29.980
And soon I realized that his standards did not match up with the standards set forth in the Bible.

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:38.980
This was a time where I really had to sit down and decide what I wanted to do to either pursue a relationship with this man or Jehovah.

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:45.980
I still believed in the truth that Jehovah had set out, so I chose Jehovah.

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:52.980
I realized shortly after my break-off that I could not continue in my ways.

00:01:52.980 --> 00:02:01.980
I became very anxious. I also was very emotionally distraught, and this took me away from the meetings.

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:11.979
When I tried to go back to meetings, not only did I feel guilt and anxiety of what people might do or react to me coming into the kingdom hall,

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:16.979
but also just getting motivated to go prove to be a challenge.

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:22.979
There were times when I would shower, and I couldn't make it any farther along in my daily routine.

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:28.979
There were times when I made it into my car, but I couldn't get the will to drive to the kingdom hall.

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:34.979
And there were times when I made it to the kingdom hall, but I couldn't open the front door of the kingdom hall.

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:45.979
So what started as a couple of months being away from meetings, soon turned into six months, which soon turned into a year, and then two years.

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:58.979
I felt so distant from the congregation and from Jehovah. I realized it would take a big change for me to get back to the meetings and back to Jehovah.

00:02:58.979 --> 00:03:08.479
Not too long after this, I got to relocate to the East Coast with a job opportunity, and I saw this as a fresh start.

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:19.479
And it happened to be also around the same time as the memorial, and I was surprised to find the letter in my mail from an elder in the local territory that had invited me.

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:29.479
When it became night for the memorial, I was still anxious knowing that I hadn't been to meetings outside of the memorial for over two and a half years.

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:40.479
These were people that I had never met before, but I realized the importance of the memorial, and it was time for me to make my stand and show I had taken my stand.

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:51.479
So I went to the memorial. There, I was welcomed by many people that were friendly, eager to meet me, and really encouraging for me to keep coming to the meetings.

00:03:52.479 --> 00:04:00.479
In time, I was attending all the meetings on a regular basis, and the elders approached me wanting to know if I wanted a Bible study.

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:05.479
I had been raised in the truth and thought I don't need a Bible study.

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:15.479
However, I also knew that they would keep asking, and so when they came the second time and asked, I realized, maybe I can't do it on my own.

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:21.480
So I gladly accepted a Bible study with a sister in the congregation, and I'm so glad I did.

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:31.480
She proved to be a listening ear. I had supported myself for so long. I realized that in life, you can't just rely on yourself. You need help.

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:37.480
And she helped me see that Jehovah's always there to provide help, as well as those in the congregation.

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:47.480
Specifically, she showed me a watchtower article regarding Psalm 23 that Jehovah is our shepherd, that he cares for us.

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:53.480
He wants to look out and protect us, be there to help us when we go through hard times.

00:04:53.480 --> 00:05:00.480
I also had the opportunity to have a Bible study with the circuit overseer when he was visiting our congregation.

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:17.480
He was really encouraging, and he helped me appreciate that from my background, I could look to others in the congregation and help them, either when I see them going down a wrong path, or when they're returning to the congregation and offering encouragement to them.

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:25.480
I'm thankful that I came back to the congregation because now more than ever, I feel Jehovah is real and very interested in me.

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:30.480
I've also received many blessings from coming back to Jehovah in his congregation.

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:37.480
I found a loving husband who I've been able to work with on construction projects at Kingdom Halls and Assembly Halls.

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:46.480
I've had an increased share in the ministry, even at times pioneering, and recently I've been able to commute to Bethel as a part-time commuter.

00:05:49.269 --> 00:06:02.269
I'm determined to stay close to Jehovah in his organization, so that way I can help others in the brotherhood going forward, whether it's on a one-on-one basis, or a time of need such as a natural disaster.

00:06:02.269 --> 00:06:05.269
I want to make sure I can do all I can to help others.
