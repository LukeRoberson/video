00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:04.070
I was raised by my mother in the small village.

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:09.070
At a very young age, my mother taught me how to read and write.

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:12.070
She used various charts and publications.

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:19.440
After the meetings, my mother would share what she enjoyed at the meetings

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.440
and would ask us what we enjoyed.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:26.440
So, it was important for me to listen carefully at the meetings and take notes

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:30.440
because I also had to tell her what I'd enjoyed.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.439
As I was getting a better understanding of what I was reading,

00:00:34.439 --> 00:00:42.810
that stirred in me a desire to comment and Japan to comment at the meetings in my own words.

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.810
Commenting at the meetings made me feel part of the congregation

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:49.810
and made me enjoy the meetings even more.

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:52.810
Also, that made me want to do more for Jehovah.

00:00:52.810 --> 00:01:03.219
Like most teenagers, I enjoy texting.

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:15.920
But I learned that I can show personal interests better by having face-to-face conversations.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:24.730
As I worked on doing that, my communication skills improved.

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:31.730
In addition, the training in our organization helped me to find a job to support pioneering.

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:38.099
When I was asked to be a tutor for a couple's son,

00:01:38.099 --> 00:01:41.099
I told them that I hadn't taken any courses for it,

00:01:41.099 --> 00:01:49.500
but that we were taught how to teach well at the weekly meetings of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.500
They said, oh, we really like the way you talk.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:02:00.269
Please start tutoring our son tomorrow.

00:02:00.269 --> 00:02:04.269
I come from Germany. I was born in Kohlberg.

00:02:04.269 --> 00:02:08.270
I went to the meetings. I went in the ministry.

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.270
But my heart wasn't there.

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.270
Since I was so focused on my own feelings,

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:22.500
it was hard for me to show personal interests in others.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.500
My roommate often took me along in her studies.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.500
She cried together with them when they cried.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.500
She was more than just a Bible teacher to them.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.500
She was really a friend.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.500
I learned to love people more.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.500
As a result of a more intense relationship with Jehovah,

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.740
and a deeper love for people in the ministry,

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:50.740
it brings me more joy.

00:02:50.740 --> 00:03:00.250
I grew up in a family of farmers.

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:10.300
My parents trained us to do household chores.

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.300
When I worked secular,

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:17.300
there was a trap in earning a lot of money and becoming materialistic.

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.300
But the training our parents gave us when we were kids

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.300
helped me to keep my life simple.

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:30.300
So at work, when I was offered overtime for higher salary,

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:35.300
I didn't accept it, even if it meant a lower salary.

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:44.479
And a wake article also helped me a lot.

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:48.479
It mentioned there how to budget money using envelopes

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:52.479
marked with daily expenses, like this one.

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:59.139
And it has helped me a lot to stay content

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:03.139
and not spend money on things I don't need.

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:09.759
And it helped me to focus on my pioneering.

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:14.759
I wanted to be able to devote everything I had to Jehovah's service.

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:17.759
But there were times when I wanted to go to university

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:20.759
and see how far I could go in this world.

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:24.759
Instead of letting my feelings dictate what I should do,

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:27.759
I decided to think things through.

00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:29.759
I thought of Paul's example.

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:34.759
He had received education and he had riches, fame and position.

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:40.259
However, he said they were rubbish to him.

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:43.259
If that was the case, I thought whatever I would be gaining

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:46.259
would be even more worthless.

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:50.259
I chose to work part-time as a water meter reader.

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:52.259
I had dedicated myself to Jehovah,

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:55.259
so I wanted to give him back my all.

00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:59.259
I was able to spend more time in Jehovah's service.

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:06.540
When I was young, I used to dream of becoming someone important.

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:09.540
I used to think when I turned 18,

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:12.540
I would be appointed as a ministerial servant.

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:18.939
But when the time came, I wasn't appointed as a ministerial servant.

00:05:18.939 --> 00:05:21.939
I was really disappointed.

00:05:21.939 --> 00:05:25.939
Then my mom encouraged me to think about Moses' example.

00:05:25.939 --> 00:05:28.939
He thought he had all the qualities and skills

00:05:28.939 --> 00:05:30.939
to lead the nation of Israel.

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:34.939
But Jehovah knew that he wasn't quite ready.

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:40.740
And he hadn't cultivated humility.

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.740
I stopped focusing on myself

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:45.740
and started to think about others

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:48.740
paying attention to what they needed.

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:53.740
I was determined to accept whatever work I was assigned to do in the congregation.

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:57.740
And this has helped me to work well with the brothers

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:12.199
and to serve unitedly and with joy.

00:06:12.199 --> 00:06:16.199
When I was 23 years old, I started pioneering.

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:18.199
Then I was invited to SKE

00:06:18.199 --> 00:06:25.040
and I was assigned to go to Albania as a missionary.

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:27.040
I became a pioneer.

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:37.379
Now I'm a translator in the remote translation office.

00:06:37.379 --> 00:06:42.379
I married a brother who had similar spiritual goals as me.

00:06:42.379 --> 00:06:44.379
We pioneered together for two years,

00:06:44.379 --> 00:06:48.379
and then we got the wonderful opportunity to service construction servants.

00:06:48.379 --> 00:06:53.709
I pioneered for about two years.

00:06:53.709 --> 00:06:57.709
Then I was invited to Bethel and I served in the binary.

00:06:57.709 --> 00:07:01.920
I started pioneering.

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:05.920
Then I received an invitation to attend SKE.

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:11.920
I am currently serving here in the service department in the Philippines branch.

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:15.920
I never thought that Jehovah would use me in such a manner.

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:18.920
No.

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:20.920
Never.

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:22.920
I never would have expected that.

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:25.920
I never imagined this.

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:29.920
One public talk had a profound effect on me.

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:31.920
The speaker said,

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:35.920
you have already dedicated your life to Jehovah.

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:38.920
Are you now living up to your dedication?

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:41.920
I can still give him something.

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:43.920
I'll apply for SKE.

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:47.920
At times, I feel so insignificant and inadequate.

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:53.920
However, I realize that Jehovah makes anyone who is willing to be used by him successful.

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:55.920
With any form of service,

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:58.920
our being qualified comes from God.

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:01.920
I learned that if Jehovah gives us an assignment,

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:05.920
he will also give us the skills and training we need

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:08.920
to be successful in the assignment.

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:11.920
Although I didn't have the experience needed,

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:16.920
Jehovah still saw something in me and gave me this assignment.

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:19.920
I thank Jehovah from the bottom of my heart

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:22.920
and view this assignment as a real blessing.

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:26.920
I can see how Jehovah has been helping us all along.

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:30.920
It's like he's holding our hand tightly saying,

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:34.919
don't worry, I'm right here with you.

00:08:34.919 --> 00:08:38.919
I get to spend eight hours each day serving Jehovah

00:08:38.919 --> 00:08:42.919
with like-minded friends who love talking about him.

00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:44.919
It's great.

00:08:44.919 --> 00:08:51.519
I can't think of words to describe my deep gratitude to Jehovah.

00:08:51.519 --> 00:08:53.519
Jehovah has blessed me so much.

00:08:53.519 --> 00:08:55.519
He has drawn me to his family.

00:08:55.519 --> 00:08:57.519
He made me his friend.

00:08:57.519 --> 00:09:01.519
He has used me in ways I've never imagined before.

00:09:01.519 --> 00:09:13.429
Jehovah has made me see his hand even more as I allow him to use me.

00:09:13.429 --> 00:09:16.429
I wake up in the morning and start my day with Jehovah

00:09:16.429 --> 00:09:18.429
by preparing for the ministry.

00:09:18.429 --> 00:09:22.970
Then I go out with my service partners.

00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:25.970
We talk about Jehovah.

00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:28.970
We think about how we can help others come closer to Jehovah.

00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:32.970
Back home, I talk to my roommate about our ministry that day.

00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:37.309
Then I take time for Jehovah.

00:09:37.309 --> 00:09:42.309
I feel like I'm spending every second of every day with Jehovah.

00:09:42.309 --> 00:09:46.309
And that alone is an enormous gift for me.
