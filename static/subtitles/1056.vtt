00:00:01.139 --> 00:00:05.620
What would you say is your greatest desire in life?

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:10.660
If the Psalmist who wrote Psalm 146 had been asked that question, he probably would have

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:14.539
answered with the words in the opening verses.

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:23.019
Praise John, let my whole being praise Jehovah, I will praise Jehovah all my life.

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:28.820
Is it not also our greatest desire to praise Jehovah forever and to teach others how they

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.739
can worship Him along with us?

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:38.340
Those sentiments are nicely expressed in our original song entitled All I Can Give.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:57.399
Listen to a reciting of the opening words as we watch a portion of the music video.

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:07.590
Oh Heavenly Father, I want to give all I can give.

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:18.439
My desire is to please you and love you as long as I live.

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:29.980
I'll help those who listen to find in your word what they need to preach and to teach

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:41.780
as the way I can really succeed as I praise you, Jehovah.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.659
My faith is getting stronger each day.

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:52.469
I'll reflect on my dedication.

00:01:52.469 --> 00:02:03.180
I'll walk in your way.

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.700
Be glad that I did not try to sing those words to you.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:13.819
It is true that our faith gets stronger each day that we praise Jehovah, but what are

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:18.099
those who do not know Him or who lack faith in Him?

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:23.620
As we study the Bible with Him, we want to help them to find in God's word what they

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.620
need to worship Jehovah with strong faith.

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:28.939
How can we do that?

00:02:28.939 --> 00:02:35.340
Well, faith is based on evidence, so to have faith a person must first acquire an accurate

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.259
knowledge of Bible truth on which they can build their faith.

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:46.259
And a good place to start is with Jesus' words at John 17 and 3, which we know very well.

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:51.020
In prayer to Jehovah, he said, this means everlasting life.

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:57.620
They're coming to know you, the only true God, and the one whom you sent Jesus Christ.

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.460
Now what is Jesus saying?

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:05.460
Well that to gain everlasting life, people need to develop a personal relationship with

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:12.539
Jehovah, and that requires learning the truth about both God and Christ.

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:16.259
What does that require of us as Bible teachers?

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:17.740
Three things.

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:24.139
First, we have to clear up any confusion on people's minds about the identities of God

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:25.819
and Christ.

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:32.819
And two scriptures that we can use are Jeremiah 10, 10, and Matthew 16, 16.

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:37.939
Jeremiah 10, 10, and Matthew 16, 16.

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:43.180
Jeremiah 10, 10 says, but Jehovah is truly God.

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.580
He is the living God.

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:54.379
And at Matthew 16, 16, it reports, Simon Peter answered, you are the Christ, the Son

00:03:54.419 --> 00:03:56.860
of the living God.

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:01.860
So Jehovah is the living God, and Jesus is the Son of the living God.

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.900
What could be clearer than that?

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.539
And yet simply acknowledging these basic facts is not enough.

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:16.579
So then second, we need to help Bible students build strong faith in Jehovah.

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:23.620
As we learned in the first talk of this convention, having faith involves coming to know Jehovah

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:31.180
as a real person trusting in him and forming an unbreakable friendship with him.

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:37.500
This involves learning what Jehovah likes and dislikes and knowing his values and standards.

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:45.100
Then the student can do what God's Son said as recorded John 14 verse 1, exercise faith

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.060
in God.

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:52.300
But then Jesus added, exercise faith also in me.

00:04:52.300 --> 00:05:00.060
So third, we want to help Bible students build strong faith in Jesus.

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.060
What especially do they need to believe about Jesus?

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:11.459
But we can let the Apostle Paul answer, as stated at Ephesians chapter 1 verse 7, Ephesians

00:05:11.459 --> 00:05:18.899
1 7, he wrote, by means of him we have the release by ransom through the blood of that

00:05:18.899 --> 00:05:19.899
one.

00:05:19.899 --> 00:05:28.139
Yes, the forgiveness of our trespasses according to the riches of his undeserved kindness.

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:33.660
When a person learns that Jesus gave his life for him personally, then he can begin to exercise

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:39.420
faith in the power of the ransom, that it is the basis for forgiveness of one sins, that

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:44.220
it offers the hope of everlasting life under Christ's kingdom and that it is the greatest

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:49.379
proof of God's love for us.

00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:55.300
People need to accept the whole truth about both Jehovah God and Jesus Christ.

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:57.579
But still that is not enough.

00:05:57.579 --> 00:06:03.740
For Romans 10, 10, the Bible says with the heart one exercises faith.

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:09.660
A person must not only believe the truth, but must also value it, because only then will

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:14.180
he be motivated to act in harmony with the truth.

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:18.220
Otherwise he could reject convincing evidence of the truthfulness of what he is learning

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:23.740
and continue to hold on to false beliefs and wrong practices.

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:31.220
So we must do all we can to reach the student's heart as we conduct Bible studies.

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:34.459
Now does this seem like a daunting task for you?

00:06:34.459 --> 00:06:40.779
Well, we have been given a wonderful new tool with which to build heartfelt faith, the

00:06:40.779 --> 00:06:47.220
study book, Enjoy Life Forever, an Interactive Bible Course.

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:53.699
It uses key scriptures, clear reasoning, effective questions, beautiful artwork, and stirring

00:06:53.699 --> 00:07:00.860
videos to help the teacher reach the heart of the student and draw out what he truly

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:03.139
believes.

00:07:03.139 --> 00:07:09.300
If you have the book, or if you have it in your JW Library app on your phone or tablet,

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:14.939
please open it now to Section 1.

00:07:14.939 --> 00:07:21.740
Now look at the lessons in that section that progressively build faith in Jehovah.

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:28.819
In lesson 4, the student learns who the only true God is and that his name is Jehovah.

00:07:28.819 --> 00:07:34.100
Lesson 5 builds faith that Jehovah really is the author of the Bible.

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:40.180
Lesson 6 reveals that Jehovah is the creator of the universe in the source of all life.

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:43.220
Lesson 7 explains what Jehovah is like.

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:46.899
He is a real person with many appealing qualities.

00:07:46.899 --> 00:07:55.220
And Lesson 8 and 9 show how the student can become God's friend and draw close to him.

00:07:55.220 --> 00:08:00.860
Some people however find it difficult to imagine being friends with anyone they cannot see

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:04.180
let alone with God himself.

00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:09.300
Open Lesson 8, Lesson 8 you can be Jehovah's friend.

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:14.259
And in the next video, follow along as we see how a teacher uses what is provided in

00:08:14.259 --> 00:08:21.300
the book to help her students build faith in Jehovah's desire to be her friend.

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:27.860
As we look in, they are starting to consider the information under 0.6, what Jehovah does

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:31.939
for his friends.

00:08:31.939 --> 00:08:36.700
Ok good, now 0.6, what Jehovah does for his friends.

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:38.700
Cassie, can you tap that link?

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:41.379
Jehovah has done so much for me.

00:08:41.379 --> 00:08:52.960
I was 14, things that happened in the past started to catch up with me emotionally.

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:58.840
And I felt like everything that had happened in my life was my fault.

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:04.240
Learning from the Bible that God says that He will take my right hand, that He will

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:07.960
fortify me, that He will really help me.

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:17.929
It blew me away.

00:09:17.929 --> 00:09:25.370
You mentioned a Bible passage where Jehovah takes our hand.

00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:26.370
Can you read that?

00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:39.419
And I say a 41, 10 and 13, please, do not be afraid, fry him with you, do not be anxious

00:09:39.419 --> 00:09:46.700
for I am your God, I will fortify you, yes, I will help you, I will really hold on to

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:49.100
you with my right hand of righteousness.

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:55.340
13, for I Jehovah your God and grasping your right hand, the one saying to you, do not

00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:57.820
be afraid, I will help you.

00:09:57.820 --> 00:10:02.980
So Cassie, according to these verses, what is Jehovah promised to do for all of his friends?

00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:05.019
Help us when we're down or scared?

00:10:05.019 --> 00:10:09.659
Yes, let's look a little closer though.

00:10:09.659 --> 00:10:16.019
I will fortify, I will help, I will really hold on.

00:10:16.019 --> 00:10:21.340
Does that sound like a friend who can help or a friend who wants to help?

00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:28.100
I never thought of God, Jehovah, like that.

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:31.340
Do you think that Jehovah would make a good friend?

00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:32.340
Sure.

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:33.340
Why?

00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:43.740
In verse 10, Jehovah stretches out his hand to you, which one?

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:44.980
His right.

00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:51.940
And then in verse 13, he takes your hand, which one?

00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:52.940
My right.

00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:53.940
How?

00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:58.929
Cassie, come here.

00:10:58.929 --> 00:11:12.879
So is Jehovah beside you holding your hand or is he in front?

00:11:12.879 --> 00:11:14.200
That's it.

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:20.759
His right hand, taking your right hand, he's facing you.

00:11:21.759 --> 00:11:34.860
To pull you up and out, Cassie, what is Jehovah pulled you out of?

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:47.440
Hopelessness, and that is a direct result of friendship with Jehovah.

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:52.080
It grows stronger the more we talk to him.

00:11:52.080 --> 00:12:01.139
Let's look at that in the next section, okay?

00:12:01.139 --> 00:12:07.379
What a beautiful example of using enjoy life forever to build faith in Jehovah.

00:12:07.379 --> 00:12:10.940
This student Cassie appeared troubled and distressed.

00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:15.740
But the sister who is teaching her is so compassionate and patient.

00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:19.860
And did you notice that the sister did not talk too much?

00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:25.940
She just effectively used the video, scripture, and bolded questions to draw out the student's

00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:32.700
feelings, and helped her to visualize what Jehovah has promised to do for her.

00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:38.019
Our new study book also progressively builds faith in Jesus.

00:12:38.259 --> 00:12:47.620
And look at the lessons in that section that progressively build faith in Jesus.

00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:54.779
In lesson 15, the student learns who Jesus is and why learning about him is so important.

00:12:54.779 --> 00:13:00.460
Lesson 16 outlines what Jesus did on earth and how that affects us.

00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:06.659
Lesson 17 explains what Jesus is like and how we can imitate his fine qualities.

00:13:06.659 --> 00:13:13.500
Next down to Lesson's 27 and 28, which show that Jesus' death proves how much Jehovah

00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:16.899
and Jesus love us.

00:13:16.899 --> 00:13:21.580
Many people, however, do not understand the ransom sacrifice of Jesus, or they do not

00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:25.059
view it as God's personal gift to them.

00:13:25.059 --> 00:13:29.379
But the Apostle Paul believed that with all his heart.

00:13:29.379 --> 00:13:35.740
In lesson 27, entitled, how can Jesus' death save us?

00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:40.139
And go to point five, the ransom is Jehovah's gift to you.

00:13:40.139 --> 00:13:47.419
Now you'll notice that the read scripture is Galatians 2 verse 20.

00:13:47.419 --> 00:13:51.940
Galatians 2 20, which reads,

00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:55.220
I am nailed to the stake along with Christ.

00:13:55.220 --> 00:14:00.299
It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who is living in union with me.

00:14:00.299 --> 00:14:06.899
Indeed, the life that I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God, who

00:14:06.899 --> 00:14:13.429
loved me and handed himself over for me.

00:14:13.429 --> 00:14:18.710
Those words should come to mind when answering the last review question for this lesson.

00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:24.429
So in this next video, see how a teacher uses the Explore feature at the end of the lesson

00:14:24.429 --> 00:14:28.549
to reach the heart of his skeptical student.

00:14:28.549 --> 00:14:37.039
As we look in, they are discussing the last review question.

00:14:37.039 --> 00:14:38.519
OK, Gene.

00:14:38.519 --> 00:14:45.220
The last review question is, how can Jesus' death benefit you?

00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:50.259
I suppose I should say that it means forgiveness for my sins, but God's not going to forgive

00:14:50.259 --> 00:14:51.580
me.

00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:52.740
What makes you feel that way?

00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:53.740
I don't feel.

00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:54.740
I know.

00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:59.419
I made better choices in my business than I did at home.

00:14:59.419 --> 00:15:00.419
Sorry.

00:15:03.049 --> 00:15:10.090
Gene, scroll down to where it says, explore, and click under, can Jehovah forgive even

00:15:10.090 --> 00:15:11.090
serious sins?

00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:13.289
OK, got it.

00:15:13.289 --> 00:15:15.889
Can you read the second paragraph, please?

00:15:15.889 --> 00:15:18.169
Sure.

00:15:18.169 --> 00:15:24.850
Some people have committed gross sins and wonder whether God can forgive them.

00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:32.210
Happily, the Word of God says the blood of Jesus, His Son, cleanses us from all sin.

00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:38.769
Jehovah willingly forgives even serious sins if we have a proper repentance attitude.

00:15:38.769 --> 00:15:43.210
The blood of Jesus cleanses us from all sin.

00:15:43.210 --> 00:15:49.730
Through the ransom, Jehovah forgives our sins, even serious ones, and he draws us to them.

00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:53.769
But Ron, why should anyone get a free pass?

00:15:53.769 --> 00:15:55.809
Because it's not free.

00:15:55.809 --> 00:15:58.970
Do you see the scripture link to Isaiah chapter 1, verse 18?

00:15:58.970 --> 00:15:59.970
I see it.

00:15:59.970 --> 00:16:01.730
Can you read it, please?

00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:06.649
From now, and let us set matter straight between us, says Jehovah, though your sins are

00:16:06.649 --> 00:16:10.370
like scarlet, they will be made as white as snow.

00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:16.049
Though they are as red as crimson cloth, they will become like wool.

00:16:16.049 --> 00:16:23.090
So forgiveness of our sins is possible if we set matter straight.

00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:30.600
What do you, Gene, think that means?

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:32.200
I need to do what's right.

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:33.200
I'm trying.

00:16:33.559 --> 00:16:35.720
Yeah, that's good.

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:37.240
It also involves how we feel.

00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:38.679
We should feel sorry.

00:16:38.679 --> 00:16:40.200
I'm sorry.

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:43.440
No, that's a good sign, Gene.

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:50.769
Lastly, let Jehovah help you with a step that's the hardest for many of us.

00:16:50.769 --> 00:16:57.940
He can help you forgive yourself.

00:16:57.940 --> 00:17:03.809
Jesus died for me.

00:17:03.809 --> 00:17:08.289
Ron, I think I'm going to need a little more time to process this.

00:17:08.289 --> 00:17:10.819
We all do.

00:17:10.819 --> 00:17:12.900
Let's go ahead and conclude with a prayer.

00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:19.940
And we'll specifically ask Jehovah to strengthen your faith in the ransom and his forgiveness.

00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:24.819
Later, when you pray, you can beg him for the same thing.

00:17:24.819 --> 00:17:26.500
Thank you.

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:27.500
OK.

00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:30.329
Let's say a prayer.

00:17:30.329 --> 00:17:33.230
Jehovah, how many times?

00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:38.710
Gene needed convincing that Jesus' sacrifice benefited him personally.

00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:43.910
If not convinced of that in his heart, he would not have the faith needed to become Jesus'

00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:45.470
disciple.

00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:49.789
The brother was familiar with the contents of the Explore section, and chose to discuss

00:17:49.789 --> 00:17:55.789
with Gene the watch-tower article that could best help him.

00:17:55.789 --> 00:18:00.190
At other times, if needed, the teacher could give the student homework to read an article,

00:18:00.190 --> 00:18:04.710
or to watch a video from the Explore section and get his observations at the next study

00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:07.029
session.

00:18:07.029 --> 00:18:12.230
In the video, Ron was going to pray specifically for Jehovah to strengthen Gene's faith in

00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:15.069
the ransom and in God's forgiveness of him.

00:18:15.069 --> 00:18:20.309
God an excellent way to keep helping the student to draw close to Jehovah and build faith

00:18:20.309 --> 00:18:23.390
in God's Word.

00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:29.950
God's Spirit produces faith only in people whose heart favors the truth over lies.

00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:35.549
Let us use enjoy life forever to teach the truth to those with whom we study the Bible,

00:18:35.549 --> 00:18:39.990
and to help build their faith in Jehovah and Jesus.

00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:44.950
And let us pray for Jehovah's help to reach their heart.
