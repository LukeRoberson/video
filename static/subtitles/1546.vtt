00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.370
What an experience.

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:06.370
That's why loyalty to Jehovah has been so important.

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:08.369
That was so true, Brother Brown.

00:00:08.369 --> 00:00:12.369
How about you? Has your loyalty ever been tested?

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:14.369
Oh, yeah. I remember.

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:15.369
It was years ago.

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:19.370
And an elder came to give me counsel after a talk.

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:22.370
And let's just say I was not exempt.

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:24.370
You were really quiet the whole way home.

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:25.370
Is everything all right?

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:27.370
Yeah, I'm fine.

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:28.370
What is on your mind?

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:31.370
I can't believe the nerve that Ben has.

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:32.369
Ben?

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:33.369
Yeah, Ben.

00:00:33.369 --> 00:00:36.369
He gave me counsel about that talk that I gave last week.

00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:38.369
Really? What did he say?

00:00:38.369 --> 00:00:41.369
I don't know. Something like...

00:00:41.369 --> 00:00:43.369
I didn't use enough scriptures.

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:45.369
Whatever.

00:00:45.369 --> 00:00:47.369
I mean, it was hard to listen.

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:51.780
You know, I've been an elder longer than he has.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.780
And he comes up to me and gives me counsel about my teaching.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.780
Please tell me you didn't argue with him.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.780
Oh, of course not.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.780
But it wasn't easy.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.780
I thanked him and said something like...

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.780
I'll give it careful thought.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.780
And I'll apply what he said.

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.780
So you did the right thing?

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:23.329
Yes, but did I really?

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:27.329
I took the counsel, but I don't like my attitude.

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:31.329
I let pride get in the way of another elder giving me counsel.

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:34.329
Just because I've been an elder longer.

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:41.379
So what are you going to do about it?

00:01:41.379 --> 00:01:43.379
Pray. I mean, that's what I should do.

00:01:43.379 --> 00:01:51.379
And then go to Ben and ask him to explain what I didn't give him a chance to explain.

00:01:51.379 --> 00:01:53.379
Wow, brother Brown.

00:01:53.379 --> 00:01:57.379
I can't picture you reacting that way to counsel. Let alone getting counsel.

00:01:57.379 --> 00:02:01.379
That was the problem. Neither could I.

00:02:01.379 --> 00:02:04.379
If I was going to remain loyal to Jehovah,

00:02:04.379 --> 00:02:07.379
I needed an attitude adjustment.

00:02:07.379 --> 00:02:09.379
So what did you do?

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:11.379
I prayed.

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:16.379
And I asked if I could really conduct myself as a lesser one.

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:21.379
I went back to Ben and asked him to give me the counsel that he had prepared for me.

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:25.379
I volunteered for assignments I hadn't done for a while.

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:28.379
You know things that we do that go unnoticed.

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:32.379
I felt my little, my attitude improved.

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:36.379
After that, I felt closer to Jehovah.

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:41.379
Seeing the need for more humility, well, was humbling.

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:46.379
I never realized, but it seems like everyone's had lessons to learn along the way.

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:48.379
Believe me, I am still learning.

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:52.379
If I hadn't changed back then, would Jehovah's help?

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:55.379
Well, things would be so different today.
