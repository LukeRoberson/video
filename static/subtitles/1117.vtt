00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:07.250
Because of the civil war, we had to take refuge in a safer part of the country.

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:12.410
When we arrived, soldiers took us to internment camps to hold us until they could confirm

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:14.210
our identities.

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:20.570
In the camps, we lived in tents and it was unbearable hot in them.

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.690
It was a struggle even to get water.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:29.929
We needed to wait in a queue for 4-5 hours every day.

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:32.689
During the war, our eldest son was killed.

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:36.850
It was a big loss for our family.

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:43.770
All we could do to cope was pray to Jehovah and find comfort in the Bible.

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.409
One day, the brothers from the Relief Committee came and informed us that a regional convention

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:49.890
would be held.

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.929
They had spoken to the camp officials requesting permission for us to go.

00:00:55.929 --> 00:01:01.170
For 4 days, morning and evening, we went to the officials to ask for permission, but

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.569
they would not tell us if we would be released for the convention.

00:01:05.569 --> 00:01:12.129
Suddenly, when afternoon, much to our surprise, we were approved to leave the camp for 5 days.

00:01:12.129 --> 00:01:15.489
At that time, we had been in the internment camp for months.

00:01:15.489 --> 00:01:17.890
We had not been allowed to go anywhere.

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:25.560
We were so happy that we got the permission to attend the convention, we never expected it.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.680
At that time, we had some clothes, but we had nothing for the 3-day convention.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:36.280
However, the brothers outside the camp helped us enormously.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:44.010
They were with us cared for all our needs, so we could be ready for the convention.

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:49.890
We still wondered where we were going to stay and how we would get our recommendations.

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.849
However, when we arrived, the brothers hugged us and warmly welcomed us.

00:01:55.849 --> 00:01:59.409
We were really encouraged.

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:04.730
Even though we faced many challenges and difficulties in the internment camp, that convention was

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:11.409
like a nourishing meal for us, it was a real joy eating at Jehu was stable.

00:02:11.409 --> 00:02:15.650
We can never forget those moments.

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.090
After the convention, the brothers from the governing body gave a special talk to those

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:26.550
from the internment camps that took really strengthened us.

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:32.229
The convention helped us to be courageous, especially after we returned to the camp.

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:37.669
Although we faced many losses, the convention not only gave us comfort, but also helped

00:02:37.669 --> 00:02:42.020
us to face the challenges ahead.

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:47.419
Now my younger son and I are serving as ministerial servants, and my wife has been serving as a

00:02:47.419 --> 00:02:50.580
regular pioneer for the past 17 years.

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.460
She continued pioneering even while we were in the internment camp.

00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:01.219
We realized that Jehu was always there caring for us and sustaining us continuously.
