00:00:01.389 --> 00:00:05.509
Have you ever had an important decision suddenly thrust on you?

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:10.990
You thought you knew the right thing to do, but as soon as you decide, you start having

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:14.470
second thoughts, maybe even regrets.

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:19.589
And now you can't stop thinking, did I do the right thing?

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:25.109
This tendency to repeat a thought over and over again is called rumination.

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.989
And when those thoughts make us feel anxious, it can be bad for our health.

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:35.149
Some of you students made tough decisions before you came to this class.

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:36.909
Thank you for that.

00:00:36.909 --> 00:00:42.109
And everyone right now is faced with challenging decisions every day.

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:47.590
So what can we do to stop anxious rumination once it starts?

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:54.070
Well, open your Bibles with me to Psalm 37 verse 5, and notice the advice that is given

00:00:54.070 --> 00:01:06.590
to us here, commit your way to Jehovah, rely on him, and he will act in your behalf.

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:13.069
Now the word for commit here literally means to roll or remove something from our life.

00:01:13.069 --> 00:01:21.230
So as the footnote says, we need to roll our way, our concerns, our anxieties upon Jehovah.

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:27.010
When we ruminate anxiously, we're holding on to our problem.

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:32.310
But the Bible says through prayer, we have to take the problem off our shoulders and

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.469
put it on Jehovah's.

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:38.989
In other words, we no longer act as if the burden is ours.

00:01:38.989 --> 00:01:42.790
We need to leave it in his hands.

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.829
It sounds so simple, but at times it's hard to do.

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:51.590
So what can help us when we have trouble letting go?

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:58.790
Well our suggestion today is to let Jehovah inspire you with awe.

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:04.349
Now to inspire someone means to make them feel that they want to do something and can

00:02:04.349 --> 00:02:05.670
do it.

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:11.669
And it may be that Jehovah gave us the emotion of awe for that very purpose.

00:02:11.669 --> 00:02:14.870
You may be wondering now, how can awe help me?

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:21.469
Well, open your Bibles again, this time to Genesis, chapter 28.

00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:27.389
And let's look at an example together that illustrates how this can work.

00:02:27.389 --> 00:02:31.789
In verse 10, we catch up with the patriarch Jacob.

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:33.389
He's on the road.

00:02:33.389 --> 00:02:40.710
Notice, Jacob departed from Beersheba and kept going toward Herod.

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:43.110
Why was he going there?

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.229
Well, the main reason was to get away from his brother, Esau.

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:47.710
Why?

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:53.750
Because Jacob had just made a tough decision and Esau was mad.

00:02:53.750 --> 00:03:00.229
You know the story, for most of his life, Esau despised the family birthright.

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:02.990
And that upset Jacob very much.

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:07.389
So at some point, he purchased the birthright from him.

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:08.750
Years go by.

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:15.590
And then one day, their father Isaac is getting ready to bless Esau as the first born.

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.669
Can you picture the scene?

00:03:17.669 --> 00:03:21.550
What was Jacob going to do?

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:26.550
It's not possible today to know all the factors that influenced Isaac, Rebecca, and Jacob

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.069
back then.

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:34.150
But the fact is, Jacob's decision put a strain on the whole family.

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.830
Esau began plotting to kill his brother.

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.150
And that's why Jacob was on the road.

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.669
Do you think he might have been ruminating a bit that day on what happened?

00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:49.150
Did he perhaps have second thoughts?

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.150
Was he asking himself that I do the right thing?

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.270
Was it okay to fool my father?

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:59.270
What does Jehovah think of me now?

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:02.629
Those would have been reasonable questions.

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:05.229
Of course, we don't know what Jacob was thinking.

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:11.590
But if he was having second thoughts, what happened next must have helped him to stop

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.590
ruminating on them?

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:18.310
Notice what we read in verses 11 and 12.

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:24.269
In time, he came to a place and prepared to spend the night there because the sun had

00:04:24.269 --> 00:04:25.750
set.

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:30.589
So he took one of the stones of that place and set it to rest his head on and lay down

00:04:30.589 --> 00:04:32.509
there.

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:42.430
And look, there was a stairway set on the earth and its top reached up to the heavens.

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:48.069
And there were God's angels ascending and descending on it.

00:04:48.069 --> 00:04:54.149
Now this heavenly ladder may have looked like a rising flight of stones, like the one

00:04:54.149 --> 00:04:57.990
you see here in this illustration.

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:02.029
Jacob could see now that he was not alone.

00:05:02.029 --> 00:05:07.829
He was a small part of an awesome organization.

00:05:07.829 --> 00:05:13.670
And there's communication between the different parts of that organization, angels, minister

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:20.189
in some important way between Jehovah and humans who have his approval.

00:05:20.189 --> 00:05:21.189
And there was more.

00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:24.990
Let's continue in verse 13.

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:29.149
And look, there was Jehovah stationed above it.

00:05:29.149 --> 00:05:37.189
And he said, I am Jehovah, the God of Abraham, your father, and the God of Isaac, the land

00:05:37.189 --> 00:05:40.149
on which you are lying to you.

00:05:40.149 --> 00:05:45.709
I am going to give it and to your offspring.

00:05:45.709 --> 00:05:50.470
How comforting those words must have been to Jacob.

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:54.310
Jehovah wasn't displeased with him, quite the contrary.

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:59.870
He promised to bless Jacob in a marvelous way.

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:06.550
Jehovah apparently used this awesome experience to help Jacob to let go of any anxiety he might

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:08.189
have had.

00:06:08.189 --> 00:06:15.110
As long as he continued to do his best, Jacob could trust Jehovah to do the rest.

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:16.990
What a relief.

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:21.170
This is reaction in verse 17.

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:28.370
And he grew fearful and added, how awe-inspiring this place is.

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:31.089
This can only be the house of God.

00:06:31.089 --> 00:06:35.329
And this is the gate of the heavens.

00:06:35.329 --> 00:06:38.050
Jacob's relief here is almost palpable.

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:40.050
He's no longer conflicted.

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:46.170
The vision inspires him to make a vow of loyalty to Jehovah forever.

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:51.850
You can read what he did and said in the latter part of this chapter.

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:57.329
Now verse 17 uses the same Hebrew word twice.

00:06:57.329 --> 00:07:01.689
The first time, it's translated as fearful.

00:07:01.689 --> 00:07:06.209
The second time, as awe-inspiring.

00:07:06.209 --> 00:07:11.569
And that may be because awe is a surprising emotion.

00:07:11.569 --> 00:07:16.689
It's a wonderful mix of inspiration and fear.

00:07:16.689 --> 00:07:22.209
You sense you're in the presence of someone or something greater than yourself, but it

00:07:22.209 --> 00:07:26.889
makes you feel small in a good way.

00:07:26.889 --> 00:07:30.649
Awk and humble you, and that shifts your thinking.

00:07:30.649 --> 00:07:36.970
It helps you to see things as they are and not as you expect them to be.

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:44.449
That's the kind of fear Proverbs 1 and 7 says, is the beginning of knowledge or wisdom.

00:07:44.449 --> 00:07:50.290
And that may be why at times, Jehovah evokes awe in us.

00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:59.089
Like Jacob, people often say they feel more centered and spiritual after an awesome experience.

00:07:59.089 --> 00:08:06.329
Sometimes to pull us out of ourselves, it connects us on a deeper level with Jehovah.

00:08:06.329 --> 00:08:10.810
And it reconnects us with what is most important.

00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:17.459
Jehovah's sovereignty, his creation, and his people.

00:08:17.459 --> 00:08:22.180
Now getting away from Issa did not end Jacob's problems.

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:28.459
There were other times in his life when he again became very anxious and afraid.

00:08:28.459 --> 00:08:34.019
But true to his word, Jehovah was always there.

00:08:34.019 --> 00:08:41.100
As long as Jacob was faithful, Jehovah made sure he would succeed.

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:46.860
Twenty years later when Jacob returned to Canaan with his family, Jehovah sent out a company

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:49.299
of angels to greet him.

00:08:49.299 --> 00:08:52.460
How awesome was that?

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:57.740
Well, what does all of this mean then for you and me?

00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:06.419
Psalm 89 7 says, Jehovah is awe-inspiring to all those around him.

00:09:06.419 --> 00:09:16.019
If you've ever hiked in the Banff National Park, or walked in the Mure Woods, or felt

00:09:16.019 --> 00:09:23.419
goose bumps as you looked up into the night sky, you know what awe feels like.

00:09:23.419 --> 00:09:28.659
You've experienced Jehovah inspiring you.

00:09:28.659 --> 00:09:34.820
So the next time you need to get out of your head, remember awe.

00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:40.179
Take a walk in the woods, sing your favorite kingdom song.

00:09:40.179 --> 00:09:46.259
awe may be the most underutilized way we know to help us to stop ruminating on anxious

00:09:46.259 --> 00:09:52.419
thoughts and fully commit our way to Jehovah.

00:09:52.419 --> 00:09:55.379
Let your problems stress you out.

00:09:55.379 --> 00:10:03.659
Do your research, pray for guidance, make the best decision you can, and then let your

00:10:03.659 --> 00:10:07.340
Jehovah inspire you with awe.
