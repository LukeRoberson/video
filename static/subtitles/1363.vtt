00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:07.389
How do we know that Jehovah really sees each one of us, no matter where we are?

00:00:07.389 --> 00:00:09.369
Consider an example.

00:00:09.369 --> 00:00:18.089
Thousands of refugees who face severe hardships in their home countries have sought shelter in parts of Europe.

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:28.300
Watch how Jehovah has lovingly assured them that they're not alone by satisfying their spiritual thirst.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.899
Welcome to Greece.

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:39.700
We really feel that Jehovah is blessing us by opening a large door of opportunities

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:45.100
to preach the good news to the many refugees who are straining into the country.

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:52.399
For this reason, the brothers immediately informed us of the situation

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:59.000
and redirected the bodies of elders to concentrate on the harbours, especially in chaos.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
The brothers were willing to work in shifts 24 hours a day.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:14.569
The refugee shelters in our area have only families with children and are located near a military airport.

00:01:14.569 --> 00:01:18.569
Whenever military planes flew overhead and the children would see and hear them,

00:01:18.569 --> 00:01:22.569
they would immediately run and try to hide because they were afraid.

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:27.569
They sought protection from the tragic conditions they had experienced during warfare.

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:31.569
This impressed upon us how greatly they needed the comforting message of the good news,

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:35.569
so we felt the urge to approach them.

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:45.569
Therefore, the service department arranged for four language classes to be held for the brothers.

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:49.569
We try to speak to people in a language quite different from our own.

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:52.569
At times we might think, will these people understand us?

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:56.569
Will we be able to reach their heart with these basic truths?

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:02.569
Something that helped me not to hesitate to approach these people despite the language barrier

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:05.569
is what our teachers told us in the language class.

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:08.569
Go and talk to them, show them things from the Bible.

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:13.569
Even if you don't say things perfectly, they will understand you.

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.569
After we received permission from the branch office,

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:20.569
we also printed thousands of tracks since we did not have enough.

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:26.240
This whole effort created an atmosphere of enthusiasm.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.240
I am deeply moved when I see how lovingly Jehovah cares for these people

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.240
who have never had the opportunity to hear the Kingdom message

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.240
that gives them a future and a hope.

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:45.240
It was exciting for them to hear that we have a Bible-based video in their language.

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:51.240
We told them that the problems, calamities and the terrible war they had experienced

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.240
were not punishment from God,

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.240
but the result of the influence that Satan did,

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.240
there were exercises over this system of things.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.240
And this provided a good answer to their question.

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.240
On a return visit, after two days,

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.240
a refugee girl said something very touching.

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.240
Now I understand why we have to go through all this.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.240
It's very difficult, but it's not God's fault.

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:20.240
On another occasion, Gardiniya, a refugee woman who showed interest told us,

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.240
since meeting you, I have a purpose in life.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.240
I have a reason to live.

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:27.240
Until now, I was just waiting to die.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.120
A refugee approached the Arabic witnessing cart

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.120
and we read Revelation 21 and 4 to him.

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.120
He said,

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.120
please, could you read that to me once again?

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.120
So we read it a second time.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.120
He replied,

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.120
may I have a Bible of my own?

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.120
So we gave him a Bible.

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.120
Then he said,

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.120
would you please show me the sentence you read in my Bible?

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.120
So we marked the verse for him.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.120
And on the way back to our home at about 11 o'clock at night

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.120
on the same road at a well-lit point,

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:05.590
we saw that same refugee sitting on the sidewalk reading the Bible.

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:08.590
About two and a half years ago, I met Mustafa.

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:11.590
He attended the meetings and made speedy progress.

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.590
Mustafa was baptized a few months before the refugees started pouring in.

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:18.589
We do not believe that this was a coincidence.

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:19.589
He would say,

00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:21.589
I want to speak about Jehovah,

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:23.589
but I can't do that in the Greek language.

00:04:25.589 --> 00:04:28.589
When I can speak to people who are refugees,

00:04:28.589 --> 00:04:30.589
just as I am a refugee,

00:04:30.589 --> 00:04:32.589
in my own language,

00:04:32.589 --> 00:04:35.589
this is a great opportunity for me.

00:04:35.589 --> 00:04:39.589
And when I see that they're listening to the truth and are loving it,

00:04:39.589 --> 00:04:41.589
it makes my heart beat faster.

00:04:41.589 --> 00:04:43.589
It touches my heart.

00:04:44.589 --> 00:04:46.589
By expanding my ministry,

00:04:46.589 --> 00:04:50.589
I'm sharing in a form of service that could even be described as missionary work,

00:04:50.589 --> 00:04:54.589
since I'm helping people hear about Jehovah for the very first time.

00:04:54.589 --> 00:04:58.589
I'm living what I have only read about in experiences.

00:05:00.589 --> 00:05:03.589
Many were, perhaps for the first time,

00:05:03.589 --> 00:05:06.589
discovering new skills in themselves,

00:05:06.589 --> 00:05:09.589
indicating how Jehovah, through his spirit,

00:05:09.589 --> 00:05:12.589
can enable certain ones to cultivate qualities

00:05:12.589 --> 00:05:15.589
they didn't realize they had to search and extend.

00:05:15.589 --> 00:05:23.050
We are so grateful to Jehovah for opening a door leading to such wonderful activity.

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:30.730
It gives us great joy and we praise him daily for this.

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:32.730
At the time, this report was prepared

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:36.730
over 100 Bible studies have been started.

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:38.730
One refugee told the brothers,

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:42.730
you are the best thing that has happened to us here in Greece.

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:45.730
We thank Jehovah for meeting you.

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:46.730
Another said,

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:48.730
we do not need material things.

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:49.730
We need hope,

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:52.730
and you are giving this to us through the Bible.
