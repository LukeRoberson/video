00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:10.820
We received a report from San Francisco, California in the United States, where publishers have been engaged in special Metropolitan Witnessing since 2013.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:17.820
It's helping our brothers reach multiple language groups, start Bible studies, and make disciples.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:42.439
When I'm rolling the cards down to get ready for the work, I can feel people's eyes on me, and it makes me feel proud that I'm representing Jehovah even before I get to the location.

00:00:43.439 --> 00:00:47.439
We have a chance to use our Bibles very regularly.

00:00:47.439 --> 00:00:52.439
We talk to honest-hearted people who are interested in really learning what the Bible teaches.

00:00:52.439 --> 00:01:03.579
Jehovah is reaching people in those far-to-reach areas where it could mean their life to even talk about things such as the Bible.

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:11.530
You're part of the Metropolitan work. You get to welcome people being drawn by Jehovah.

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:20.719
We see thousands of people every day who walk by our hearts.

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:33.930
While we're placing literature in up to 40 different languages each week, what's really exciting is to see how many conversations we're studying and how many Bible studies were initiated.

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:41.930
We're visible to a lot of people in the community, especially those who were inactive or maybe were raised around the truth.

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:52.299
Jehovah's arranged to have his people put right in the center of everything, and we're able to meet people from all over the world.

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:08.180
I met people from Peru, South Africa, Japan, Germany, England, France, Italy, Cameroon, Congo, Boku.

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:23.439
It's sure that greeting will be something like Makadi, Monon Zani, Chinese New Yorker, Zakawanda, Zamanga, Ferreira, Kuvera, and Gapano.

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:25.439
It's not terrible from so-called Bible.

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:32.620
It means, which means, would you like to study the Bible?

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:43.370
Which means, would you like to study the Bible in sign language?

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:51.370
So when I asked her if she'd seen the sign language Bible, she shook her head no, and I showed her act 1727.

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.370
And as soon as it was done, she started signing. I understood that.

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:01.370
And then she said, didn't she say this was a free act? So right then, she started downloading it on her phone.

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.370
We had a gentleman come up and wanted to first sit, he said debate, and then he said, just discuss.

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:14.370
But as he's talking with us, he had to catch his train, but he missed three trains, because he wanted to continue the conversation and speak with us.

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:19.370
It was a really good experience because we just get to talk to people and let them see a different side of us.

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.370
It's not necessarily about whether we place a book with him or not.

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:29.370
And in the end, he turned to my husband and I, and said, you know, you're really good ambassadors.

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:36.370
We start Bible studies here every day, and these studies are conducted globally.

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:43.370
I met Alfredo in 2014, right before the memorial. He approached the cart.

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:50.370
He had a rough life. He was doing a lot of bad things. And so, he felt that he couldn't overcome them.

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:55.370
So I told him that no matter how big his problems are, they're not too big for Jehovah.

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:02.370
And so, I encouraged him to start studying the Bible again.

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.370
Come now and let us sit matter straight between us.

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:15.370
Since Jehovah, though your sins are like scarlet, they will be made as white as snow.

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:20.370
When Jehovah forgives you, he forgives you completely.

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:27.370
I got baptized, and in the same month, I started auxiliary pioneering.

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:33.370
It is such a privilege to be one of Jehovah's Witnesses with brothers all around the world.

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:41.759
If anybody is hesitant to take part in a special metropolitan witnessing work,

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:44.759
maybe you're worried about finances.

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:48.759
Time. Are you just afraid that it's something different? You won't know what to do.

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:52.759
Please don't let any of those things stop you.

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:58.759
It's from Jehovah. Grab, hold a bit, tight, don't let go.

00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:28.170
Each month, the brothers and sisters in San Francisco's metropolitan witnessing distribute over 5,000 publications

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:32.170
and start an average of 185 Bible studies.

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:38.170
After some initial concern from local authorities over having literature cards at the Golden Gate Bridge,

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:44.170
authorities have expressed appreciation for our brothers being there with a Bible's message of hope.

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:52.170
It's been requested that we always have on hand the April 2014 awake with the cover title, Why Go On?

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:55.170
Three reasons to keep living.

00:05:55.170 --> 00:06:00.170
One afternoon, an officer approached a card and said, Well, your magazine worked.

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:05.170
The police had just helped a young woman who was thinking of jumping from the bridge.

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:13.170
When they reached her, she had the weak issue in her hand and had decided not to jump.

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:17.170
Life in this system can be difficult for everyone.

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:24.170
But our witnessing work comforts people and teaches them to know and thank their creator for life.
