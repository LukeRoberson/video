00:00:02.189 --> 00:00:06.190
He wasn't the most extraordinary among the apostles.

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:10.189
For example, he didn't walk on water.

00:00:10.189 --> 00:00:13.189
He didn't receive the keys to the kingdom.

00:00:13.189 --> 00:00:16.190
He wasn't one of the sons of thunder.

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:18.190
He didn't see the transfiguration.

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:21.190
He didn't write a Bible book.

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:26.190
In fact, all together, he's only mentioned 12 times in the Scriptures.

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:31.190
And that's mostly when the list of all the apostles is given.

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.189
Who are we talking about?

00:00:34.189 --> 00:00:37.189
That would be Andrew.

00:00:37.189 --> 00:00:44.189
See, Andrew was best known as the brother of Peter.

00:00:44.189 --> 00:00:48.189
That's what he was famous for, primarily.

00:00:48.189 --> 00:00:52.189
Peter's mentioned some 150 times in the Scripture.

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:56.189
And it seems that Peter was always in the limelight,

00:00:56.189 --> 00:01:00.189
whereas Andrew always seemed to be in the shadows.

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:03.189
Peter was extraordinary.

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:06.189
Andrew was ordinary.

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:13.189
Like Andrew, most of us view ourselves as just ordinary.

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:16.189
We're not the valovictorian.

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:18.189
We're not the greatest speaker.

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:22.189
We're not miscongeniality.

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:25.189
We're just in the shadows.

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:28.189
But is that how Jehovah sees us?

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:32.189
Is that how he saw Andrew?

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.189
Let's look at Andrew the person for just a minute.

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:40.189
Open your Bibles if you would to John chapter 1, please.

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:42.189
John chapter 1.

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:46.189
And if you begin just following along with me, verse 35,

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:52.189
we see that Andrew was a disciple of John the baptizer.

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:56.189
And one day when he was with John the baptizer,

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:01.189
John said, see the Lamb of God.

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:05.189
What is it that Andrew did immediately?

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:11.189
He immediately left following John to follow Jesus.

00:02:11.189 --> 00:02:15.189
Now, we don't have a lot of time for this talk.

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:20.189
But what did Jehovah see in Andrew at that point?

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:25.189
He must have seen that Andrew wanted to draw close to God.

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:31.189
And that he would be adaptable and that he would be willing to change

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:37.189
in order to be able to draw closer to Jehovah and do his will.

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:40.189
Jehovah must have loved Andrew for that attitude.

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:47.069
If you follow along in verse 38 and 39,

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:51.069
notice that it says,

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:55.069
Jesus turned and saw them following him.

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:57.069
And do you notice what Jesus said?

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:00.069
He said, what are you looking for?

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:03.069
Now, how did Andrew respond to that?

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:07.069
Did Andrew say, well, you know, Lord,

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:10.069
I'd like to have a better assignment,

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:14.069
something that brings a little prestige, maybe some accolades.

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:21.069
And along with that, if I had a bigger room, one with a view.

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:23.069
But he didn't.

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:26.069
What he said was, Lord, where are you staying?

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:31.069
And the Bible shows us that Andrew then went with Jesus

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:34.069
and stayed with him till about four o'clock in the afternoon.

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:38.069
Now, that was interesting because he was really showing

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:44.069
that he valued spiritual things over the mundane things.

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:49.069
But then, after that time, verse 40 and 41,

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:53.069
it says, Andrew ran to find his brother Peter.

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:55.069
And he said five words.

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:58.069
Five words that would change their lives forever.

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:02.069
We have found the Messiah.

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:04.069
We have found the Messiah.

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:06.069
Now, how did Andrew know that?

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:10.069
Well, Andrew must have been a man who loved God's Word.

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:12.069
He must have been familiar with it.

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:16.069
And so in that time that he was with Jesus,

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:19.069
he could take what he'd read in the scriptures

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:22.069
and compare them with the man in front of him.

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:25.069
And he came to that conclusion.

00:04:25.069 --> 00:04:27.069
He was a spiritual man.

00:04:27.069 --> 00:04:29.069
He loved God's Word.

00:04:29.069 --> 00:04:32.069
And as a result of his zeal,

00:04:32.069 --> 00:04:36.069
he brought his brother Peter to Jesus.

00:04:36.069 --> 00:04:39.069
Well, now, that's a little bit about what we know about Andrew,

00:04:39.069 --> 00:04:40.069
the person.

00:04:40.069 --> 00:04:42.069
What about Andrew, the Apostle?

00:04:42.069 --> 00:04:45.069
Well, let's go over to John chapter 6 now.

00:04:45.069 --> 00:04:50.759
John chapter 6.

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:57.959
And we look at 440 and 41.

00:04:57.959 --> 00:05:00.959
Well, excuse me, John chapter 6 verses 5 through 9.

00:05:00.959 --> 00:05:03.959
And here we see a large crowd of people now

00:05:03.959 --> 00:05:06.959
that are gathering to see Jesus.

00:05:06.959 --> 00:05:08.959
And Jesus wants to feed them.

00:05:08.959 --> 00:05:09.959
You remember the account.

00:05:09.959 --> 00:05:15.959
And so he says to fill up one feed these people.

00:05:15.959 --> 00:05:19.959
Philip says, Lord, that's impossible.

00:05:19.959 --> 00:05:20.959
200 didn't area.

00:05:20.959 --> 00:05:22.959
I wouldn't feed them all.

00:05:22.959 --> 00:05:25.959
So there was probably over 5,000 people there.

00:05:25.959 --> 00:05:27.959
But now while he,

00:05:27.959 --> 00:05:30.959
Philip is talking to Jesus trying to reason with him,

00:05:30.959 --> 00:05:32.959
what is Andrew doing?

00:05:32.959 --> 00:05:34.959
Andrew goes through the crowd.

00:05:34.959 --> 00:05:37.959
He finds a little boy that has some fish and some bread.

00:05:37.959 --> 00:05:40.959
And he brings that little child to Jesus.

00:05:40.959 --> 00:05:44.959
Now, did Andrew have any idea what Jesus was going to do?

00:05:44.959 --> 00:05:45.959
He couldn't have known.

00:05:45.959 --> 00:05:47.959
There's no way he could have known.

00:05:47.959 --> 00:05:51.500
But he must have thought.

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:56.500
He must have seen enough to know that Jesus could do something.

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.500
And of course he did.

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.500
But what was the lesson?

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:03.500
Well, while Philip saw the problem,

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.500
Andrew was looking for a solution.

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.500
Then you may notice again that as usual,

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:12.500
Andrew is bringing people to Jesus.

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:16.029
Just as a side point,

00:06:16.029 --> 00:06:19.029
what do you think that little boy

00:06:19.029 --> 00:06:22.029
would be talking about when he became my age?

00:06:22.029 --> 00:06:25.029
Yeah, after that miracle he saw.

00:06:25.029 --> 00:06:28.029
He must have really been an impactful one.

00:06:28.029 --> 00:06:31.029
Now, let's go to John chapter 12.

00:06:31.029 --> 00:06:34.980
John chapter 12.

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:39.329
And look down at verse 20 through 22.

00:06:39.329 --> 00:06:43.329
Because now we have a group of Greeks

00:06:43.329 --> 00:06:45.329
who've come to worship at the festival.

00:06:45.329 --> 00:06:47.329
And they approach Philip.

00:06:47.329 --> 00:06:48.329
And what do they want to do?

00:06:48.329 --> 00:06:50.329
They want to see Jesus.

00:06:50.329 --> 00:06:52.329
What does Philip do?

00:06:52.329 --> 00:06:54.329
Philip goes to Andrew.

00:06:54.329 --> 00:06:55.329
What does Andrew do?

00:06:55.329 --> 00:06:59.329
Andrew takes Philip and they go to Jesus.

00:06:59.329 --> 00:07:02.329
Now, two things.

00:07:02.329 --> 00:07:07.329
Number one, Andrew recognized the channel.

00:07:07.329 --> 00:07:09.329
He didn't try to circumvent it.

00:07:09.329 --> 00:07:11.329
He didn't try to make the decision.

00:07:11.329 --> 00:07:14.329
He recognized the channel.

00:07:14.329 --> 00:07:18.329
And secondly, Andrew was a friend.

00:07:18.329 --> 00:07:21.329
Because now he would be a mentor

00:07:21.329 --> 00:07:28.329
to Philip and teach him to go to the channel as well.

00:07:28.329 --> 00:07:35.329
Well, the Bible doesn't say much about Andrew.

00:07:35.329 --> 00:07:39.329
But we can see that Andrew didn't think it was all about him.

00:07:39.329 --> 00:07:42.329
He always had the desire to help others.

00:07:42.329 --> 00:07:46.329
So, in this brief discussion,

00:07:46.329 --> 00:07:49.329
is there anything really ordinary about Andrew?

00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:54.730
Not in Joe's eyes.

00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:56.730
So, while it's true,

00:07:56.730 --> 00:07:59.730
Andrew never walked on water.

00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:01.730
He never wrote a Bible book.

00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:04.730
He also never denied Christ.

00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:07.730
He never got his mom to ask for special favors.

00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:10.730
He was never known for being a doubting Andrew.

00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:19.170
And he never ever was called Satan.

00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:22.170
He was a force for good for those around him.

00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:26.170
Now, the lessons were the class.

00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:28.170
Be adaptable.

00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:32.169
Be adaptable to the leanings of Jehovah's organization,

00:08:32.169 --> 00:08:35.169
even if you don't fully understand them.

00:08:35.169 --> 00:08:40.169
Number two, don't get tripped up by the desire for the mundane things.

00:08:40.169 --> 00:08:44.169
Remember the question that Jesus asked Andrew,

00:08:44.169 --> 00:08:47.169
what are you looking for?

00:08:47.169 --> 00:08:51.169
That's a good reset question for all of us from time to time.

00:08:51.169 --> 00:08:53.169
What are we looking for?

00:08:53.169 --> 00:08:57.169
Number three, remember that Jehovah is not limited

00:08:57.169 --> 00:09:00.169
in how he can work out problems.

00:09:00.169 --> 00:09:03.169
Give him the chance to show what he can do for you.

00:09:03.169 --> 00:09:09.169
And you may find the answer comes in some very unexpected ways.

00:09:09.169 --> 00:09:12.169
And finally, in your assignment,

00:09:12.169 --> 00:09:18.169
don't be quick to pass over this seemingly ordinary people.

00:09:18.169 --> 00:09:20.169
Look for the Andrews.

00:09:20.169 --> 00:09:22.169
They're in all the congregations.

00:09:22.169 --> 00:09:26.169
They're in all the Bethels through like the hidden gems

00:09:26.169 --> 00:09:29.169
that are all around us.

00:09:29.169 --> 00:09:33.169
Acknowledge them, encourage them,

00:09:33.169 --> 00:09:36.169
see what they're contributing,

00:09:36.169 --> 00:09:38.169
and say something about it.

00:09:38.169 --> 00:09:42.169
And those hidden gems will begin to come out of the shadows

00:09:42.169 --> 00:09:46.169
and they will shine in the light of appreciation.

00:09:46.169 --> 00:09:51.169
So in the days to come, be a steady force for good,

00:09:51.169 --> 00:09:54.169
show loving kindness to all.

00:09:54.169 --> 00:09:56.169
Give Jehovah your best,

00:09:56.169 --> 00:09:59.169
and give the friends your best,

00:09:59.169 --> 00:10:01.169
and give it with love.

00:10:01.169 --> 00:10:06.169
And you will never ever be in the shadow in Jehovah's eyes.
