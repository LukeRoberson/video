00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:06.559
Our broadcast this month has the theme Cherish your privilege of prayer.

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:11.560
Do you think it's appropriate to label prayer as a miracle?

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:17.559
Miracles are described in our New World Translation Glossary of Bible terms

00:00:17.559 --> 00:00:24.559
as actions are phenomena that surpass all powers known to humans

00:00:24.559 --> 00:00:29.559
and are attributed to a supernatural agency.

00:00:29.559 --> 00:00:33.560
Does prayer fit that description?

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:38.560
The moment you say a prayer, your innermost thoughts and feelings

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:43.560
are communicated instantly to the Creator from wherever you are,

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.560
even if you pray silently.

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.560
That's certainly beyond any power humans know.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:55.560
Therefore, the fact that a human can call out to God in prayer

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:01.560
and be heard by Him is truly a miracle.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:10.560
It's only by the undeserved kindness of Jehovah that we can approach his heavenly throne in prayer.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.560
Today our lives are very complicated and in some cases very troubled.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:23.560
Whether young or old, there are times we may feel overwhelmed with our problems.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.560
At other times we may simply feel alone and helpless.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.560
What can we do?

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.560
The Apostle Paul says that prayer will help.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:44.560
Please open your Bible to Philippians 4-6 and listen to his spirit inspired recommendations.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:51.560
Do not be anxious over anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication,

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.560
along with thanksgiving, let your petitions be made known to God.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:03.560
So Paul is saying that in all circumstances of life prayer is essential.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:10.560
While no one around us can see the inner struggles we may be having,

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.560
Jehovah sees them.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.560
What will he do?

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.560
Let's read verse 7.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:27.560
And the peace of God that surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts and your mental powers by means of Christ Jesus.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:36.560
This incomparable peace of God is an unusual tranquility enjoyed by Jehovah's dedicated servants,

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.560
even in the most trying circumstances.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:48.560
Have you felt that inner peace that results from intimate communication with Jehovah?

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:58.560
How much we benefit from prayer is closely related to the strength of our personal relationship with Jehovah.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:05.560
A key factor in that relationship is found at Psalm 37-3.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:14.560
Trust in Jehovah and do what is good, reside in the earth, and act with faithfulness.

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:22.560
Likely, you'd agree that when we need to talk to someone about our worries, we go to a trusted friend. Why?

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:32.560
It's because we've developed a relationship with him. He knows us and our situation, and we know we can count on him.

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:39.560
More than ever, we need a close personal relationship with Jehovah.

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:55.560
For that to be possible, we must be convinced that Jehovah knows who we are and that he understands us, our situation, our worries, our concerns, and our needs.

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.560
Notice what Jehovah promises in verses 4 and 5.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:06.560
Find exquisite delight in Jehovah, and he will grant you the desires of your heart.

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:13.560
Commit your way to Jehovah, rely on him, and he will act in your behalf.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:24.560
Jehovah does know who we are. He understands us better than anyone else, even better than we understand ourselves.

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:30.560
He invites us to trust him, and he promises to act in our behalf.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:38.560
The miracle of prayer lets us experience Jehovah's love in a truly intimate way.

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:46.560
Our Father personally takes the time to listen to us. He has not delegated that to anyone else.

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:55.560
However, you might be wondering, why would the Creator of the universe want to listen to me?

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:02.560
The inspired answer at 1 Peter 5.7 says, because he cares for you.

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:13.560
Your determination to keep doing the best you can to serve him in spite of all the problems you face endears you to him.

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:18.560
He feels for you and is eager to help.

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:25.560
How does that make you feel? At Psalm 111, it says,

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:32.560
I love Jehovah because he hears my voice, my pleas for help.

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:42.560
Even though we can't see him listening to us, it's as if we feel Jehovah's loving arms around us when we pray.

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:50.560
As a result, the more we pray, the more our love and trust in him grows.

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:55.560
What else will help us to build our love and trust in our God, Jehovah?

00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:05.560
It's more than recognizing that he hears our prayers. We must be convinced that he answers our prayers.

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:09.560
What evidence do we have that Jehovah answers prayers?

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:15.560
Let's look at some specific answers to prayers both past and present.

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.560
Open your Bible to 2 Chronicles 20.

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:28.560
When Judah was threatened by the combined forces of Ammon and Moab in the mountainous region of Seer,

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:33.560
King Jehosaphat humbly prayed for Jehovah's help.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:36.560
In verse 12, he prayed,

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:42.560
Oh, our God, will you not execute judgment on them?

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:47.560
For we are powerless before this large crowd that is coming against us.

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:53.560
And we do not know what we should do, but our eyes are toward you.

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:56.560
What was Jehovah's answer?

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.560
There was no voice from heaven.

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:02.560
Jehovah caused a prophet to speak up.

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:04.560
Verse 15 says,

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:07.560
Here is what Jehovah says to you,

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:16.560
Do not be afraid or be terrified because of this large crowd for the battle is not yours, but God's.

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:19.560
Then verse 17 continues,

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:22.560
You will not need to fight this battle.

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:25.560
Take your position, stand still,

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:30.560
and see the salvation of Jehovah in your behalf.

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:32.560
Did you note the formula?

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:37.560
Jehovah's dedicated servant is facing a serious problem.

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:40.560
He prays specifically,

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:44.560
and then he remains attentive to the answer.

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:49.560
The answer may have seemed strange to Jehosaphat.

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:52.560
Jehovah didn't provide a battle plan.

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.560
As strategies go,

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:59.560
just walking out to meet the enemy doesn't sound like a very good one.

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:04.560
But Jehosaphat discerned that this was the answer from Jehovah,

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:07.560
and he let it direct his actions.

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:09.560
What happened?

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:18.560
Jehovah fought for Judah by striking confusion into the ranks of the enemy so that they slaughtered one another.

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:24.560
Jehosaphat's prayer was answered in a mighty way.

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:30.560
We have examples in the first century of collective prayers being answered.

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:36.559
One occasion was when King Herod was out to gain the favor of the Jews.

00:08:36.559 --> 00:08:42.559
So he had the Apostle Peter imprisoned and placed under heavy guard.

00:08:42.559 --> 00:08:45.559
What would the congregation do?

00:08:45.559 --> 00:08:49.559
Acts 12-5 gives us the answer.

00:08:49.559 --> 00:08:52.559
So Peter was being kept in the prison,

00:08:52.559 --> 00:08:57.559
but the congregation was intensely praying to God for him.

00:08:57.559 --> 00:09:02.559
Did Jehovah answer their prayers in behalf of Peter?

00:09:02.559 --> 00:09:10.559
The account in verses 7-11 tells us that an angel of Jehovah led Peter out of jail

00:09:10.559 --> 00:09:13.559
and delivered him to safety.

00:09:13.559 --> 00:09:20.559
Imagine how these events must have drawn the Christians in Jerusalem closer to Jehovah

00:09:20.559 --> 00:09:25.559
when they saw that he had answered their prayers.

00:09:25.559 --> 00:09:28.559
What about today?

00:09:28.559 --> 00:09:32.559
Consider the example of our brothers in South Korea.

00:09:32.559 --> 00:09:43.559
Over the years, more than 19,000 of our brothers have been imprisoned as conscientious objectors to military service.

00:09:43.559 --> 00:09:50.559
Did you personally pray in behalf of these brothers that they might endure in their faith

00:09:50.559 --> 00:09:55.559
or that they might be released from prison if it was Jehovah's will?

00:09:55.559 --> 00:09:57.559
We're sure you did.

00:09:57.559 --> 00:10:01.559
In fact, many of you prayed for these brothers by name,

00:10:01.559 --> 00:10:07.559
just as the congregation in the first century prayed in behalf of Peter.

00:10:07.559 --> 00:10:09.559
With what result?

00:10:09.559 --> 00:10:21.559
In 2018, a series of court rulings in South Korea finally recognized conscientious objection to military service for religious reasons

00:10:21.559 --> 00:10:25.559
as a fundamental human right,

00:10:25.559 --> 00:10:31.559
and our brothers were gradually released from their prison bonds.

00:10:31.559 --> 00:10:32.559
What do you think?

00:10:32.559 --> 00:10:38.559
Did Jehovah hear our prayers in behalf of these dear brothers?

00:10:38.559 --> 00:10:50.559
As a worldwide brotherhood, there can be no doubt that our incessant prayers to Jehovah were a major factor in these marvelous developments

00:10:50.559 --> 00:10:57.559
and we praise and thank Jehovah that he's heard our prayers.

00:10:57.559 --> 00:11:04.559
What does this review of how Jehovah answered the prayers of his servants in the past and present due for us?

00:11:04.559 --> 00:11:12.559
Doesn't it build confidence that Jehovah is listening and acting on the prayers of his people?

00:11:12.559 --> 00:11:16.559
The Apostle John had that confidence.

00:11:16.559 --> 00:11:20.559
He wrote at first John 514,

00:11:20.559 --> 00:11:24.559
and this is the confidence that we have toward him,

00:11:24.559 --> 00:11:30.559
that no matter what we ask according to his will, he hears us.

00:11:30.559 --> 00:11:39.559
But now the question is, when was the last time that Jehovah answered one of your personal prayers?

00:11:39.559 --> 00:11:45.559
We spend much time on learning how to pray and what to pray for,

00:11:45.559 --> 00:11:52.559
but do we put forth enough effort on identifying the answers to our prayers?

00:11:52.559 --> 00:12:03.559
For us to have the closeness to Jehovah, we must be certain that he's listening and responding to our personal prayers.

00:12:03.559 --> 00:12:09.559
It may not always be readily discernible just how some prayers are answered.

00:12:09.559 --> 00:12:11.559
So what can we do?

00:12:11.559 --> 00:12:18.559
Take time to meditate on Jehovah's response to your prayerful requests.

00:12:18.559 --> 00:12:24.559
If you're married, freely discuss matters that you've prayed for in common

00:12:24.559 --> 00:12:28.559
and how Jehovah may be answering those prayers.

00:12:28.559 --> 00:12:33.559
Be observant and alert to things that are happening around you

00:12:33.559 --> 00:12:39.559
and learn to connect these things with the answers to your prayers.

00:12:39.559 --> 00:12:46.559
Make your prayers more specific and you'll become more keenly aware of Jehovah's answers,

00:12:46.559 --> 00:12:50.559
even though they may be subtle.

00:12:50.559 --> 00:12:57.559
Identifying your answered prayers will make Jehovah more real to you.

00:12:58.559 --> 00:13:08.559
This process of identifying answers to our prayers should be learned early on in one spiritual development.

00:13:08.559 --> 00:13:19.559
We cannot take it for granted that our children or our Bible students will connect the answers they receive to the prayers they've offered.

00:13:19.559 --> 00:13:29.559
One witness said, I find that people feel closer to God if I help them to recognize answers to their prayers.

00:13:29.559 --> 00:13:36.870
What if we can't identify the answer to one of our prayers?

00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:40.870
Does that mean it wasn't according to Jehovah's will?

00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:42.870
Not necessarily.

00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:47.870
There are two important factors that might be involved.

00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:56.870
One is that Jehovah knows the best time and way to answer our prayers.

00:13:56.870 --> 00:14:00.870
He takes all matters into consideration.

00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:06.870
The answer may not come according to our time table, but it will come.

00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:12.870
So we must be patient and keep looking for the answer.

00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:21.870
The second factor that Jehovah considers is the issue raised by Satan regarding man's integrity.

00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:30.870
Listen again to the challenge Satan makes as recorded at Job 1, 10, and 11.

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:36.870
Have you not put up a protective hedge around him in his house and everything he has?

00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:43.870
You have blessed the work of his hands and his livestock his spread out in the land.

00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:52.870
But for a change, stretch out your hand and strike everything he has and he will surely curse you to your very face.

00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:59.870
Jehovah permitted this issue to be raised out of love for his intelligent creatures.

00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:06.870
He permitted Job to undergo a test by Satan before the entire universe.

00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:19.870
Jehovah gives his creatures the privilege of proving the devil a liar and of removing the slander not only from God's name, but also from their own.

00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:26.870
So Jehovah seeing the entire issue may allow his servants to endure trials.

00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:32.870
But that doesn't mean he's not answering the prayer the afflicted.

00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:43.870
When we're under trial, we may have prayed for relief, but we may have also prayed let your name be sanctified.

00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:53.870
We must remain convinced that Jehovah will not simply answer a prayer he will provide the best answer.

00:15:53.870 --> 00:16:04.870
Isn't it true that when we maintain our integrity, even through serious illness, it can be a tremendous witness to others?

00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:07.870
That was the case with Jared Scepter.

00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:22.139
Cutsworth says, remember then your grand creator in the days of your youth before the days of your stress come.

00:16:22.139 --> 00:16:28.139
In the days of distress, they arrived early on Jared at 11.

00:16:28.139 --> 00:16:33.139
Jared was diagnosed with lymphoma cancer in the middle of 1991.

00:16:34.139 --> 00:16:45.139
We started trying to figure out how we could get him the treatment that he needed of course, but in no way would we accept a blood transfusion and neither would Jared.

00:16:45.139 --> 00:16:52.139
But Jared was in the hospital child protection services did investigate us. They were concerned there was negligence.

00:16:52.139 --> 00:16:55.139
It was just adding to the pain.

00:16:55.139 --> 00:17:00.139
The way it turned out, they back completely away from that. They realized we hadn't been negligent.

00:17:00.139 --> 00:17:11.140
So as we face different situations, we pray at the time not to have miraculous answers, but for Jehovah to open our eyes and to be able to find things.

00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:23.140
And it seemed as though he was really directing us so that we could take care of ourselves spiritually through this situation as well as take care of Jared's medical needs.

00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:37.140
I remember many times falling on my knees and praying and thinking this is it, I'm test to be on record bear and Jehovah would strengthen me.

00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:43.140
And someone would come or they would say something and they fed us.

00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:48.140
The brother made a schedule and he said, you're going to feed these friends.

00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:55.140
And the brothers' instructions were, you don't bring it and just drop the food, you stay with those friends.

00:17:55.140 --> 00:18:00.140
It made me cry, the love and the caring that we experienced.

00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:09.140
One time I remember the hallways of this hospital, 1,500 miles away from our home, started filling up with people.

00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:13.140
To me, that's answering prayers too.

00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:16.140
It was hard for us to get out of the hospital.

00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:22.140
So they recorded talks, they would look us in the eye and they'd say, now you need to listen to this.

00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:25.140
It will keep you strong.

00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:29.140
Jared was worried about us and he made it clear.

00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:34.140
He was going to be fine. He just didn't know if we were going to be.

00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:40.140
He died in June of 1992.

00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:43.140
He was at home.

00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:50.140
And the last thing he said to us was, work hard so we can all be together again.

00:18:50.140 --> 00:19:03.619
It's numbing because it's almost like you're living in nightmare.

00:19:03.619 --> 00:19:11.369
Because you never think that those things all happened to you.

00:19:11.369 --> 00:19:18.369
But it did. I didn't want people to see me cry. I didn't want pity.

00:19:18.369 --> 00:19:23.369
I didn't because of that.

00:19:23.369 --> 00:19:26.369
Those negative feelings, my imagination ran wild.

00:19:26.369 --> 00:19:37.670
What helped me, I know was Gary putting into my heart and mind that this is a fight.

00:19:37.670 --> 00:19:42.670
It's been a challenge for all mankind that if you make a heart on them, they don't love you.

00:19:42.670 --> 00:19:46.670
Satan said that about Jehovah and individuals.

00:19:46.670 --> 00:19:50.299
So I would be giving into that.

00:19:50.299 --> 00:19:56.299
The strong feelings I had in my sorrow almost made me stop.

00:19:56.299 --> 00:20:00.299
I prayed a lot to go back to the Kingdom of all.

00:20:00.299 --> 00:20:04.299
The congregation cried. They lost a little boy.

00:20:04.299 --> 00:20:08.299
It wasn't just Gary and Beth. They lost a little boy.

00:20:08.299 --> 00:20:15.980
They cried. I didn't feel alone.

00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:20.359
We hugged, we cried together.

00:20:20.359 --> 00:20:26.359
It really benefited us to get right back in the spiritual focus and get our mind up ourselves.

00:20:26.359 --> 00:20:31.359
And I could have gave into my pain and thought, well, I'm too heartbroken.

00:20:31.359 --> 00:20:37.359
It made me have more joy because I realize that now they have all.

00:20:37.359 --> 00:20:42.359
People around us were vital. The support system Jehovah has.

00:20:42.359 --> 00:20:48.359
And his word, his spirit, Jehovah answered those prayers.

00:20:48.359 --> 00:20:52.359
Our goal was really to stay in the full-time ministry.

00:20:52.359 --> 00:20:57.359
Maybe doing something else, but we never ever thought we would be in the circuit work.

00:20:57.359 --> 00:21:01.359
But to have our daughter working with their husband in the circuit work,

00:21:01.359 --> 00:21:05.359
it's almost hard to believe it's happening.

00:21:05.359 --> 00:21:09.359
We look forward to seeing Jared again, having him back with us.

00:21:09.359 --> 00:21:13.359
So I'm waiting and I know I'm not going to be disappointed.

00:21:13.359 --> 00:21:19.359
How encouraging to know that Gary and Beth are able to take vacation time to travel occasionally

00:21:19.359 --> 00:21:26.359
to see their daughter and her husband who are also serving in the traveling work.

00:21:26.359 --> 00:21:33.359
And did you notice how Gary, Beth, and Jared felt Jehovah's loving support

00:21:33.359 --> 00:21:38.359
as they prayed throughout this heart-wrenching trial?

00:21:38.359 --> 00:21:43.359
They asked for wisdom when seeking medical treatment for Jared.

00:21:43.359 --> 00:21:51.359
Jehovah put his arms around them and listened when they felt overwhelmed with grief and negative feelings.

00:21:51.359 --> 00:22:01.359
He strengthened Jared's hope in the resurrection and helped brother and sister-sector stay spiritually strong.

00:22:01.359 --> 00:22:06.359
Can there be any doubt that Jehovah was answering their prayers?

00:22:06.359 --> 00:22:13.359
Doesn't that strengthen our conviction that Jehovah will also answer Jared's prayer

00:22:13.359 --> 00:22:16.359
that they all will be together again?

00:22:16.359 --> 00:22:21.359
No, Jehovah didn't miraculously cure Jared.

00:22:21.359 --> 00:22:25.359
But through his endurance and strong faith,

00:22:25.359 --> 00:22:33.359
Jerry gives a witness to the universe that even a child that trusts in Jehovah

00:22:33.359 --> 00:22:37.359
can prove his loyalty to death.

00:22:37.359 --> 00:22:44.359
Now, other situations may turn out differently and not end up in death.

00:22:44.359 --> 00:22:50.359
If an individual feels that relief was because of Jehovah's intervention,

00:22:50.359 --> 00:22:53.359
he should certainly give thanks.

00:22:53.359 --> 00:22:59.359
However, we must recognize that Jehovah knows the best way to handle matters

00:22:59.359 --> 00:23:07.359
so that it results in honor to his name and to the lasting good of his servants.

00:23:07.359 --> 00:23:17.359
Finally, it's worth mentioning that the Bible often connects our remaining spiritually alert with our need to pray.

00:23:17.359 --> 00:23:22.359
At Matthew 26.41, Jesus said,

00:23:22.359 --> 00:23:27.359
keep on the watch and pray continually.

00:23:27.359 --> 00:23:32.359
At first Peter 4.7, Peter wrote,

00:23:32.359 --> 00:23:36.359
but the end of all things has drawn close.

00:23:36.359 --> 00:23:43.359
Therefore, be sound in mind and be vigilant with a view to prayers.

00:23:43.359 --> 00:23:47.359
Indeed, our prayers are so important,

00:23:47.359 --> 00:23:54.359
our personal prayers will help us to remain spiritually alert and active in God's service

00:23:54.359 --> 00:24:00.359
as we await the great tribulation that lies just ahead of us.

00:24:00.359 --> 00:24:08.359
So in summary, our prayers to Jehovah reveal the closeness of our relationship with Him

00:24:08.359 --> 00:24:12.359
and the degree of our dependence upon Him.

00:24:12.359 --> 00:24:22.359
They show the trueness of our faith, the depth of our devotion and the genuineness of our appreciation.

00:24:22.359 --> 00:24:32.359
Our prayers also help us remain spiritually alert as we endure these last days before the great tribulation.

00:24:32.359 --> 00:24:40.359
We'll be drawn even closer to Jehovah when we learn to recognize His answers to our prayers.

00:24:40.359 --> 00:24:47.359
Yes, we can be assured that Jehovah will not fail in giving us the desires of our heart

00:24:47.359 --> 00:24:52.359
as we continue rendering Him sacred service.

00:24:52.359 --> 00:24:59.359
May we all cherish our marvelous, miraculous privilege of prayer.
