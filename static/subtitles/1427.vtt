WEBVTT

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:11.460
We live in a beautiful quiet town in central Italy, between the sea and the mountains.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:18.539
We have many friends, some of whom are good cooks.

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.899
We have been serving for some years in a Romanian language congregation, and we preach to

00:00:22.899 --> 00:00:27.379
people who have moved to Italy to seek a better life.

00:00:27.379 --> 00:00:31.739
When we heard the announcement about the special campaign, we looked at each other and said,

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:36.109
let's go!

00:00:36.109 --> 00:00:46.929
The large door of activity was opening up to us, but there was a problem, my job.

00:00:46.929 --> 00:00:51.649
I would need a month's leave of absence, and that would be difficult.

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:56.850
We prayed, we did research, and during family worship, we decided that in order to participate,

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.380
I would ask for a one month leave from work.

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:08.349
But Jehovah had something else in mind that would create the right circumstances for us.

00:01:08.349 --> 00:01:12.590
When I arrived at work the next day, I found an unexpected situation.

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:19.150
Because of the failing economy, my boss gave me and some other employees a letter of dismissal.

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.590
I was not at all worried.

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.469
I trusted in Jehovah, and I knew that this new situation would allow me to participate

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:32.230
in the campaign.

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:36.030
Participating in this campaign is a dream come true.

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:42.590
We wanted to participate in 2013, but unfortunately things in life do not always go as we would

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:49.379
like.

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:53.299
We received some truly shocking news.

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:57.700
My father had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.700
Emotionally, it was not easy.

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:08.259
The tranquility we had dreamed and hoped for was almost gone.

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:15.099
The only thing that could help me at that moment was the hope for what Jehovah promises us.

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:21.219
In addition to my father's death, I began to experience panic attacks.

00:02:21.219 --> 00:02:26.419
I was afraid of something that didn't exist.

00:02:26.419 --> 00:02:31.460
Afraid of not being able to move on.

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:36.620
The kind of emotion that leaves a lump in your throat and you can't even breathe.

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:44.219
I realized that only Jehovah could help me feel the void that I felt.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:50.939
After a family worship, Fabio and I decided to turn in our regular pioneer applications.

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:56.419
I felt Jehovah at my side, embracing and supporting me.

00:02:56.419 --> 00:03:01.060
In the end, they turned out to be the three most beautiful years of our lives, which also

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:06.870
allowed us to participate in this beautiful campaign.

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.150
In Romania, there are many isolated territories that local brothers cannot work due to the

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:18.969
great distances to be covered.

00:03:18.969 --> 00:03:35.090
It is really exciting to reach many people by traveling on dirt roads that are often muddy.

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:46.770
The people are generous, hospitable and genuine.

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:57.580
They almost always invite us into their homes and are willing to talk to us.

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:02.099
Talking to people who do not know Jehovah and who are still very much interested in doctrinal

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:11.060
topics is really exciting.

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:16.139
Experiencing firsthand a culture different from ours, seeing people who live a more simple

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:22.220
life and trying to understand their needs is an experience that we will take with us and

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:36.410
it will help us to preach more effectively in our assigned congregation territory in Italy.

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:39.050
Now we are stronger than when we left home.

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:46.310
This experience has made us love the ministry even more.

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:55.019
We look forward to returning to our home territory with renewed zeal.

00:04:55.019 --> 00:04:59.019
We are certain that Jehovah will guide us to further service opportunities in order

00:04:59.019 --> 00:05:01.459
to help others know His wonderful purposes.
