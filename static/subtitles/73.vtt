00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:07.099
We welcome all of you to the June 2020 edition of JW Broadcasting.

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:32.020
The 148th class of the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead graduated on March 14, 2020.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:39.020
This was the exciting culmination of five months of intensive Bible instruction for the students.

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:44.020
What parting words of encouragement would they receive from the governing body and other brothers?

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:50.020
We are very happy to share with you the first part of that graduation program.

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.619
Enjoy!

00:00:53.619 --> 00:01:04.620
The theme of my opening talk to you dear Gilead students and really for all of us is imitate Jesus modesty.

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.620
Now first we ask what is modesty?

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:16.620
Well, a common definition found in our publications is being aware of our own limitations.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:25.620
And Jesus, of course, set a perfect example in always being aware of his own limitations.

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:31.620
Undoubtedly, Jesus was very familiar with Jehovah's thinking on this quality.

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:39.620
Such as expressed in Micah 6 verse 8, which was written about 700 years before Jesus came to the earth,

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:41.620
so he certainly would have been familiar with this.

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:48.620
But if you recall, the question is asked, what is Jehovah requiring of you?

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:55.620
And then part of the answer to walk in modesty with your God.

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:59.620
And there's an exclamation point after that expression.

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:05.620
Jehovah would not just like to see it in us, he's requiring it.

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.620
What is Jehovah requiring of you?

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:13.620
Jesus knew it was not optional, but a requirement that we be modest in walking with our God.

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:23.620
Now, since Jesus is our perfect role model, let's discuss four areas in which we can imitate his modesty.

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.620
And we know that will be helpful to you dear students, really for all of us.

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:36.620
Number one, Jesus was always aware that he had authority limitations.

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.620
Now, you remember the account in Matthew chapter 20,

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:49.620
when James and John tried to use their mother to get some special positions in the kingdom for them?

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.620
And you remember they had her ask her, say to Jesus,

00:02:52.620 --> 00:03:03.620
give the word that these two sons of mine may sit down one at your right hand and one at your left in your kingdom.

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.620
Remember that? But what was Jesus' answer?

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:14.620
To sit down at my right hand at my left is not mine to give.

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:20.620
But it belongs to those for whom it has been prepared by my Father.

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.620
Now, that's interesting. Jesus gave many gifts, didn't he?

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.620
He gave a lot of wine to a newly married couple at their wedding feast.

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.620
He gave the gift of healing to thousands, probably.

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.620
He fed thousands. He gave them food.

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.620
He gave a widow or son back after he died.

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:49.620
But Jesus knew to give away the second and third highest positions in the kingdom was beyond the scope of his authority.

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.620
And he acknowledged that very clearly, didn't he?

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.620
Well, that's a fine lesson for us, isn't it?

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.620
There are many things that are within the scope of our authority.

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.620
And we can go ahead and take the initiative and do those things.

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.620
See, but there are many other things that are outside the scope of our authority.

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:13.620
For example, you wives, you know, there are many things in the family that have to be decided by the husband.

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.620
Not within your authority.

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:26.620
You brothers know there are many decisions that are made in the congregation that can't be made by you, must be made by the body of elders.

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:33.620
We all know that in our Bethel department, there are many things required permission from our overseer.

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:44.620
If some of you brothers here in our class end up later serving on branch committees, then you'll need to clearly learn the parameters of your authority.

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:53.620
See, what you can handle and what really needs to be handled by the branch committee or maybe even taken to the governing body.

00:04:53.620 --> 00:05:03.620
In areas such as the foregoing, all of us need to carefully learn what falls within our authority and what falls outside of our authority.

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:09.620
And if we're endowed, it's better to check, isn't it? It's better to check if we're endowed.

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:15.620
And if we have the attitude, it's easier to get forgiveness than permission.

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.620
See, that's not a good attitude, is it?

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:27.620
Now, another aspect of Jesus having authority limitations, open up to John chapter 12.

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:33.620
And here's an interesting thought that Jesus made John chapter 12.

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:51.620
He said, for I have not spoken of my own initiative, but the father who sent me has himself given me a command about what to say and what to speak.

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:57.620
Now, you could say, according to that, Jesus had speaking authority limitations, didn't he?

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:03.620
He had no authority to go beyond what his father had taught him.

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:08.620
He had no authority to teach others things that originated in his own mind and a heart.

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:12.620
He wouldn't go beyond that. He had authority limitations.

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:15.620
Well, even more so, isn't it? Shouldn't that be true of us?

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:20.620
We have no authority to give our opinions on matters.

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:29.620
But we have to make sure when we speak that what we say is solidly based on the scriptures and what's been provided by the faithful slave.

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:34.620
But now, let's go to our second area. We can learn modesty from Jesus.

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:45.620
He always remembered his lesser importance compared to Jehovah's much greater importance.

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:48.620
How unlike Satan the devil?

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:57.620
Now, you could say he has not one modest bone in his spirit body, figuratively speaking, of course.

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:05.620
But no modesty in Satan the devil, but Jesus refused to accept titles that belong to Jehovah.

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:07.620
Why do you call me good?

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:12.620
Nobody is good except one God.

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:15.620
He always gave the credit, the glory to Jehovah.

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:23.620
He said the Son cannot do a single thing of his own initiative, but only what he sees the Father doing.

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:29.620
He never boasted. He was always willing to put Jehovah's will ahead of his own will.

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:41.620
He made the comment, Father, if it is not possible for this to pass away unless I drink it, let your will take place.

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:51.620
And think about this. He had never tried to draw attention to himself by means of high sounding vocabulary or even by means of his dress and grooming.

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:59.620
See, if he would have had some unusual dress or grooming, would you just have needed to kiss him to identify which one he was?

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:06.620
He could have said the one you're looking for is the only one in the group wearing a bright purple robe.

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:10.620
Or the only one in the group has a halibar mustache.

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:13.620
See, he wouldn't have to kiss to identify.

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:22.620
And if you look at the pictures in our publications with Jesus in the 12th, it would be hard to describe which one he was.

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:28.620
He modestly blended in with all of the others. See, now what a fine example for us.

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:39.620
When others try to praise us, including our Bible students, we should modestly redirect that praise to where it belongs.

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:44.620
We should always give credit to Jehovah for what we accomplish.

00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:54.620
I mean, we accomplish it, but give Jehovah the credit. See, first Corinthians 4.7, what do you have that you did not receive?

00:08:54.620 --> 00:09:00.620
If, in fact, you did receive it, why do you boast this though you did not receive it?

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:08.620
And in the same harmony or same vein with that scripture, we try hard not to boast.

00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:17.620
Remembering Proverbs 27 to let someone else praise you and not your own mouth.

00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:22.620
We do our best to put Jehovah's preferences ahead of our own preferences.

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:31.620
We endeavor not to draw attention to ourselves by high sounding vocabulary or even immodest dress and grooming.

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:36.620
But let's go to a third area we can learn modesty from Jesus.

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:44.620
He knew there are some things he was not entitled to know, at least not at the time.

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:47.620
Open up to Matthew 24, please.

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:56.620
Now we're familiar with this scripture, but Matthew 2436 noticed Jesus' words concerning that day and hour.

00:09:56.620 --> 00:10:07.620
Nobody knows neither the angels of the heavens nor the Son, but only the Father.

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:16.620
Now think about it, if Jesus was content with having knowledge limitations concerning confidential things,

00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:20.620
then even more so, shouldn't that be the case with us?

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:26.620
We should strive very hard not to ever try to get to know confidential things.

00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:28.620
We're not entitled to know.

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:32.620
And we certainly shouldn't reveal confidential things.

00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:36.620
And what a protection it is I was thinking for you dear wives of elders.

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:41.620
If someone asked you about a certain confidential matter, do you know anything about this?

00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:45.620
Now if you know what you shouldn't, it's very awkward, isn't it?

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:51.620
You either got to be untruthful or you got to reveal that your husband didn't keep confidentiality.

00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:55.620
But if you don't know, that should be the case.

00:10:55.620 --> 00:11:01.620
Now with a clear conscience, you can answer that question with a resounding no.

00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:05.620
No, I do not know anything about that.

00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:12.620
You dear elders would not try to obtain confidential information in the congregation or at Bethel,

00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:15.620
you're not entitled to know.

00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:23.620
Like Jesus, all of us should be content to wait for information to be revealed to us at the proper time.

00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:31.620
And if you think about it in some cases, it may mean that we will have to be content to never know certain things.

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:36.620
Now let's get to our last area, this fourth area we can learn modesty from Jesus.

00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:46.620
And that is, he was always aware of his need to fully rely on Jehovah.

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:52.620
Even though he was perfect, he did not rely on his own strength.

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:55.620
Open please to Hebrews chapter 5.

00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:59.620
This is a beautiful scripture about this perfect son of God.

00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:04.620
What is said about him, Hebrews chapter 5 verse 7.

00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:14.620
During his life on earth, Christ offered up supplications and also petitions.

00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:23.620
And notice with strong out Christ and tears to the one who was able to save him out of death.

00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:28.620
And he was favorably heard for his godly fear.

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:36.620
Now in that interesting, during his life on earth, it didn't say just a few times, one or two times, during his life.

00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:41.620
He petitioned in his plural and he gave supplications again, plural.

00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:52.620
And what were the intensities of those supplications and petitions with strong out Christ and tears he called for help.

00:12:53.620 --> 00:13:01.620
And Jehovah heard him say, if you think of the word outcry, that means a cry out loud, didn't it?

00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:07.620
A strong outcry, very loud cry out loud.

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:09.620
And then you add tears to that.

00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:15.620
It really indicates the intensity, how he really called on Jehovah to help him.

00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:18.620
That's an interesting thought, didn't it?

00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:28.620
Additionally, when Jehovah sent Jesus, younger angelic brothers to come and help him in times of need, he didn't say, well, I don't need help.

00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:31.620
Probably, I'm okay.

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:33.620
I've got this.

00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:36.620
No, he knew he needed help.

00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:41.620
And he graciously accepted that and appreciated that help.

00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:48.620
Think about this, even with Jehovah's help, he was modestly realistic of what he expected of himself.

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:50.620
You ever thought about that?

00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:53.620
With Jehovah's help, he still modestly realistic.

00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:55.620
He could only accomplish so much.

00:13:55.620 --> 00:14:00.620
As an example, during his three and a half year ministry, he knew there's only so many he could reach.

00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:02.620
Only so many people.

00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:04.620
So why is he, what do you?

00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:08.620
He modestly trained and entrusted others to do the preaching work.

00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:17.620
And even said about them, as recorded at John 1412, that they would do works greater than his works.

00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:23.620
They would reach a greater number of people, a greater area, a greater period of time.

00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:25.620
Now, think about this.

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:34.620
If the perfect son of God feared to rely on his own strength, we should be scared to death to do that.

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:36.620
We do not rely on our own strength.

00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:47.620
Never should we pridefully hold back from supplicating and petitioning Jehovah with strong outcries and tears.

00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:53.620
May we modestly accept the help Jehovah provides through our brothers and sisters.

00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:59.620
May we be modestly realistic of even what we expect of ourselves.

00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:07.620
If we imitate Jesus' modesty, these four areas we've discussed, what a protection it will be.

00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:12.620
It will protect us from many snares of the devil.

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:31.190
But now we'll turn our attention to Brother Jeffrey Jackson of the governing body.

00:15:31.190 --> 00:15:35.190
And he will develop an intriguing theme.

00:15:35.190 --> 00:15:41.190
His theme is, accept the unexpected, Brother Jackson.

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:53.840
Expect the unexpected.

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:56.840
Well, the unexpected has arrived, hasn't it?

00:15:56.840 --> 00:16:04.840
None of us expected that this graduation program would need to be modified and changed as it is.

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:07.840
And yet, what have you had to do?

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:11.840
You've had to accept the unexpected.

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:13.840
There's not much you can do.

00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:18.840
And we'd like to commend you students, soon to be graduates of this class of Gilew,

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:24.840
because you have accepted these changes in a fine positive attitude.

00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:33.840
But it does highlight to us, doesn't it, that sometimes it can be disappointing when unexpected things occur?

00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:40.840
Now, soon you'll be going to your assignments, whether back home or to a new assignment.

00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:46.840
And no doubt, you're going to face some unexpected things as well.

00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:50.840
And we'd just like to discuss one aspect of this theme.

00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:57.840
If you'd like to take your Bibles and turn with me to Ecclesiastes chapter 10.

00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:02.840
Ecclesiastes chapter 10 and verse 7.

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:06.839
And here it describes something that is unexpected.

00:17:09.339 --> 00:17:17.339
I have seen servants on horseback, but princes walking on foot, just like servants.

00:17:17.339 --> 00:17:20.339
What you wouldn't expect to see that, would you?

00:17:20.339 --> 00:17:23.339
Now, how are you going to see that?

00:17:23.339 --> 00:17:28.339
Well, the watch that made a very interesting comment about this verse, it said,

00:17:28.339 --> 00:17:35.339
those who have great ability do not always receive the recognition.

00:17:35.339 --> 00:17:42.339
And those with less ability sometimes receive more honor.

00:17:42.339 --> 00:17:48.339
So when you arrive back full of enthusiasm, you've enjoyed your Gilew training

00:17:48.339 --> 00:17:57.339
and no doubt you're thinking, I'm a different person, I've changed, and we hope you have.

00:17:57.339 --> 00:18:03.339
Maybe you might expect there will be certain privileges granted to you.

00:18:03.339 --> 00:18:12.339
And yet, at the same time, you may see that someone you don't expect is given those privileges.

00:18:12.339 --> 00:18:19.339
They may even come up to you and say, I'm so surprised, I'm shocked, they've given me this privilege.

00:18:19.339 --> 00:18:24.339
And outwardly you're saying, hmm, but inwardly you're saying, I'm shocked too.

00:18:24.339 --> 00:18:31.339
Because I'm the one who is trying to gilead, surely I should get this privilege.

00:18:31.339 --> 00:18:38.339
But when you think about it, remember, Jehovah is the one who is backing the work,

00:18:38.339 --> 00:18:46.339
and at times he does the unexpected, and in this case gives someone we don't expect a privilege.

00:18:46.339 --> 00:18:53.339
And think about it for a few moments, when you first came here, we know and remember your introductions.

00:18:53.339 --> 00:18:58.339
And quite a number of you made the comment, we received that invitation to Gilead.

00:18:58.339 --> 00:19:08.339
We were shocked, we were humbled, we were amazed, now moreover, thinking, why were we selected?

00:19:08.339 --> 00:19:13.339
And maybe some of the people in your congregation and branch walks are saying, why were they accepted?

00:19:13.339 --> 00:19:18.339
You see, maybe that was an unexpected invitation.

00:19:18.339 --> 00:19:22.339
But now here you are about to graduate.

00:19:22.339 --> 00:19:29.339
But it's good to remember that sometimes others are surprised about privileges that we're given.

00:19:29.339 --> 00:19:36.339
So what can help us to accept the unexpected when it comes to others getting privileges?

00:19:36.339 --> 00:19:39.339
Well, let's look at two principles in the scriptures.

00:19:39.339 --> 00:19:45.339
The first one is in Ecclesiastes chapter 6 and verse 9.

00:19:45.339 --> 00:19:50.339
Ecclesiastes chapter 6 and verse 9.

00:19:50.339 --> 00:19:57.339
Better to enjoy what the I see than to wonder after one's desires.

00:19:57.339 --> 00:20:01.339
This too is futility, a chasing after the wind.

00:20:01.339 --> 00:20:07.339
So in other words, be satisfied with the privileges you do have.

00:20:07.339 --> 00:20:14.339
Don't be looking for other privileges, just not satisfied with what you've already been given.

00:20:14.339 --> 00:20:22.339
Treasure the privileges you already have, and included, and that is the privilege of coming here to Gilead and being trained.

00:20:22.339 --> 00:20:33.339
Now the second principle we'd like to highlight is found in the book of Psalms, Psalm 119 verses 31 and 32.

00:20:33.339 --> 00:20:41.910
I cling to your reminders, O Jehovah, do not let me be disappointed.

00:20:41.910 --> 00:20:49.910
I will eagerly pursue the way of your commandments, because you make room for it in my heart.

00:20:49.910 --> 00:20:56.910
What's the point? Don't be disappointed. Trust in Jehovah. Trust in His arrangement.

00:20:56.910 --> 00:21:04.910
It could be that Jehovah is saying to you, look, you've already had enough privileges.

00:21:04.910 --> 00:21:13.910
You went to Gilead, remember? Now be happy that I'm letting someone else have an unexpected privilege.

00:21:13.910 --> 00:21:16.910
Well, that can be a test.

00:21:16.910 --> 00:21:22.910
Another thing that will help us in a situation like that is to remember many of the accounts in the scriptures.

00:21:22.910 --> 00:21:30.910
And one of those we'd like to refer to briefly is that of David killing Gilead.

00:21:30.910 --> 00:21:40.910
Let's think for a few moments. If you were in his right soldier, just before David offered himself to do this assignment.

00:21:40.910 --> 00:21:46.910
Who would you have expected to take down this giant Gilead?

00:21:46.910 --> 00:21:55.910
Well, probably, first of all, you would have thought about King Saul, because after all, he was head and shoulders taller than the average person,

00:21:55.910 --> 00:22:04.910
and he was a man experienced in warfare. So you might have expected, I think, King Saul is the one who will take this on.

00:22:04.910 --> 00:22:10.910
Or maybe, if you weren't thinking of King Saul, you might be thinking of his son, Jonathan.

00:22:10.910 --> 00:22:15.910
Why? Well, remember, Jonathan was a national hero by this time.

00:22:16.910 --> 00:22:25.910
There was the case there in McMash, where he and his attendant climbed up and boldly and bravely appeared before the Philistines.

00:22:25.910 --> 00:22:30.910
They killed about 20 of them, and that was the turning point in the battle.

00:22:30.910 --> 00:22:38.910
So if anyone is going to take on Gilead, probably you would expect Jonathan would be able to do that.

00:22:38.910 --> 00:22:47.910
Now, let's just assume that you were thinking maybe the best way to do this would be with a sling and a stone.

00:22:47.910 --> 00:22:52.910
So now, who would you expect to actually do this?

00:22:52.910 --> 00:22:59.910
Probably, Saul and Jonathan. Why? They were from the tribe of Benjamin.

00:22:59.910 --> 00:23:05.910
And what do you remember about the people from Benjamin? They were experts with using the sling.

00:23:05.910 --> 00:23:12.910
In fact, we had told they could sling a stone to a headbreath and would not miss.

00:23:12.910 --> 00:23:20.910
And in fact, in 1 Chronicles 122, it says that the brothers of Saul were experts with the sling.

00:23:20.910 --> 00:23:32.910
So not knowing what Jehovah is going to do, probably each one of us, if we were back then, would have thought, surely it would be King Saul or maybe Jonathan, they're the most qualified.

00:23:32.910 --> 00:23:44.190
But why wouldn't you have expected David? Well, for a start, David was just a boy. He wasn't a soldier. He didn't have experience in warfare.

00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:51.190
Yes, he'd killed a lion and a bear, but he really didn't know about fighting people in a war.

00:23:51.190 --> 00:24:00.190
Secondly, he wasn't impressive in appearance. In fact, Gilead was shocked when he saw this young man coming toward him.

00:24:00.190 --> 00:24:10.190
And thirdly, he wasn't from the tribe of Benjamin. You see, he wasn't one of these famous persons who could use the sling.

00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:19.190
The watchtower made the comment that perhaps because David lived near where the tribe of Benjamin was, maybe that's where he learned how to use the sling.

00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:29.190
But the bottom line is none of us would have expected that this young man, David, would have been used. It was an unexpected event.

00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:43.190
But now let's think for a moment about how others reacted. How did King Saul react? Well, initially, King Saul was very happy with the fact that David killed Gilead.

00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:53.190
But what happened later, that turned into jealousy, didn't it? Even into a murderous desire to kill David.

00:24:53.190 --> 00:25:05.190
But on the other hand, what about Jonathan? You see, Jonathan perhaps could have been jealous, but he wasn't. He built a strong relationship and friendship with David.

00:25:05.190 --> 00:25:26.470
So what can we learn from this account? You see, if you come across someone who gets that ideal privilege, that assignment that you always secretly have wanted, and that you actually modestly think you deserve, what will you be?

00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:43.470
A soul or a Jonathan? Yes, brothers and sisters, let's always remember, Jehovah does the unexpected and sometimes the unexpected is giving someone else you don't expect a certain privilege.

00:25:43.470 --> 00:25:49.470
Don't stand in the way of Jehovah when he uses someone else to glorify his name.

00:25:49.470 --> 00:26:03.140
Yes, rejoice in the fact that others are used, just like you are being used in an unexpected way.

00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:14.140
Well, thank you very much, Brother Jackson, for living up to our expectations. You gave, again, an excellent talk. We really appreciate it.

00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:21.140
But now we're going to get to turn our attention to Brother James Mans, who serves as a helper to the writing committee.

00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:34.140
And he has an interesting theme, do privileges make you privileged? Let me say that again, do privileges make you privileged? Brother Mans.

00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:49.140
Before coming to Gilead, all of you students enjoyed many privileges of service. Maybe you served as a regular pioneer, as a special pioneer, a construction worker, or as a field missionary.

00:26:49.140 --> 00:27:01.140
You may have served in the circuit worker at Bethel. And now you've enjoyed the additional privilege of having five months of intensive training here at Gilead School.

00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:16.140
And no doubt all of you have appreciated the fine direction you've received. Proverbs chapter 28 verse 20 says that a faithful man will receive many blessings.

00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:23.140
And no doubt all of you students feel richly blessed here on your graduation day.

00:27:23.140 --> 00:27:33.140
We're very happy for you, and we're certainly confident that there are many more blessings and privileges that await you as you go on to your assignments.

00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:43.140
But before you go, I'd just like to ask one question. Do privileges make you privileged?

00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:55.140
We ask this question because the answer will help you to have a proper view of your Gilead training and also whatever privileges you may receive as you go on to your assignment.

00:27:55.140 --> 00:28:05.140
And the answer will also help all of us to show modesty and humility in whatever assignment Jehovah sees fit to give us.

00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:16.140
So do privileges make us privileged? The simple answer is no. But in some languages, the word privilege can carry the wrong idea.

00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:33.140
For example, in English, privilege carries the meaning of entitlement. We may speak of a privileged class, people who because of their birth or because of their wealth have a higher place in society than others.

00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:47.140
A privilege that we receive in Jehovah's organization could even be misunderstood as something given to us because we're special or even better than others.

00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:56.140
The possibility of misunderstanding what is meant by the word privilege is even more pronounced in other languages.

00:28:56.140 --> 00:29:09.140
For example, in Japanese for many years, we use the word token to translate the word privilege. And if you look in the dictionary, that's the word that you should use.

00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:20.140
But many of us in the Japanese field felt a little bit uncomfortable using token because that word is formed by combining two Chinese characters.

00:29:20.140 --> 00:29:26.140
Toku means special, Ken means right.

00:29:26.140 --> 00:29:37.140
So literally that would mean you have a special right to attend Gilead school. I have a special right to serve at Bethel.

00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:41.140
But we know that is not the case.

00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:51.140
So you can imagine our delight when we receive the study article number 35 in the September 2019 issue of the watch tower.

00:29:51.140 --> 00:30:10.140
It was entitled Jehovah values his humble servants. And in a section that was discussing the need for humility when others receive privileges of service, the Japanese translators applied the principle of meaning based translation.

00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:23.140
Instead of using the dictionary meaning and calling the privileges special rights, they call them Hoshino Kikai, opportunities to serve.

00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:37.140
We were elated. Privileges are not given as a special right, rather they give us additional opportunities to be of service to Jehovah and to our brothers.

00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:50.140
So does that mean we should stop using the word privilege? Not necessarily, but we do need to have a correct understanding of its meaning in the spiritual setting.

00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:57.140
One way to gain a proper understanding is to examine how the word privilege is used in the new world translation.

00:30:57.140 --> 00:31:08.140
For example, at Luke chapter 1, verse 43, Elizabeth described a visit from Mary, the mother of her Lord, as a privilege.

00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:22.140
Now did Elizabeth mean that she had a special right to have Mary enter her home? No, rather she viewed the visit as a blessing from Jehovah.

00:31:22.140 --> 00:31:31.140
Acts chapter 7, verse 46, speaks of David asking God for the privilege of providing a dwelling place for the God of Jacob.

00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:45.140
And at 2 Corinthians chapter 8, verse 4, Paul spoke of Christians who kept earnestly begging us for the privilege of having to share in the relief ministry for the holy ones.

00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:58.140
David and Paul were not talking about any special right, rather they were describing an opportunity to work in service to Jehovah and to their brothers.

00:31:58.140 --> 00:32:05.140
So let's not be misled by the meaning that the world generally attaches to the word privilege.

00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:12.140
The direction found at Luke chapter 17, verse 10, will help us. Please open to that verse.

00:32:12.140 --> 00:32:24.140
And whenever we receive a privilege or an opportunity to serve, let's remember these words and this counsel of Jesus.

00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:36.140
Luke chapter 17, and verse 10, he said likewise, when you have done all the things assigned to you, say, we are good for nothing slaves.

00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:47.140
What we have done is what we ought to have done. Now of course this doesn't mean that we should view ourselves as useless or worthless.

00:32:47.140 --> 00:33:03.140
A note in the study Bible explains that according to the context, good for nothing conveys the idea that the slave would view himself modestly, not as deserving of some special credit or praise.

00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:10.140
And that is how we view ourselves when we receive privileges of service.

00:33:10.140 --> 00:33:22.140
Now let's consider another aspect of privileges. The English dictionary defines privilege as a right attached specifically to a position or office.

00:33:22.140 --> 00:33:31.140
However, not all privileges of service involve a specific assignment or position.

00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:42.140
The number of positions in Jehovah's organization is limited. The opportunities to serve are endless.

00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:54.140
Please open to Matthew chapter 20. We'll read verses 25 to 27 because here Jesus clarified the importance of serving over position.

00:33:54.140 --> 00:34:11.139
Now brother let already explain the setting. It's when the mother of James and John asked Jesus to give her son special positions in the kingdom. In verses 25 to 27, this is what Jesus said.

00:34:11.139 --> 00:34:23.139
But Jesus called them to him and said, you know that the rulers of the nations lord it over them and the great men wheeled authority over them. This must not be the way among you.

00:34:23.139 --> 00:34:33.139
But whoever wants to become great among you must be your minister and whoever wants to be first among you must be your slave.

00:34:33.139 --> 00:34:45.139
Yes, instead of seeking a high position of authority, Christians reach out to minister to the needs of others to serve as humble slaves.

00:34:45.139 --> 00:34:56.139
Interestingly, 1 Timothy chapter 3 verse 1 used to describe a man who is reaching out for an office of overseer.

00:34:56.139 --> 00:35:07.139
But the revised edition of the New World translation reads, if a man is reaching out to be an overseer, he is desirous of a fine work.

00:35:07.139 --> 00:35:19.139
This puts the emphasis not on the office or position, but on the qualifications that are needed by one who exerts himself to be of service to others.

00:35:19.139 --> 00:35:26.139
There are many opportunities of service that do not involve a special appointment or position.

00:35:26.139 --> 00:35:32.139
Think of Bible examples of hardworking Christian men and women.

00:35:32.139 --> 00:35:37.139
Dorcas, abounded in good deeds and gifts of mercy.

00:35:37.139 --> 00:35:43.139
Joanna, Susanna and many other women minister to Jesus from their belongings.

00:35:43.139 --> 00:35:49.139
And while Paul was in prison, Tichicus served as his personal messenger.

00:35:49.139 --> 00:35:54.139
Mark helped Paul in practical ways perhaps delivering food to him.

00:35:54.139 --> 00:36:03.139
So as you go on to your assignment, remember, privileges do not make you privileged.

00:36:03.139 --> 00:36:15.139
And whether your privileges come with an official assignment or not, humbly carry them out as opportunities to slave for Jehovah and to serve our brothers more fully.

00:36:15.139 --> 00:36:28.309
I'm going to bring all these Gilead students on my speaking assignments. They really know how to applaud.

00:36:28.309 --> 00:36:35.309
Well, thank you very much, brother man, for the privilege of hearing that talk.

00:36:35.309 --> 00:36:43.309
But please be assured we're not going to let that privilege make us feel privileged in the sense you discussed.

00:36:43.309 --> 00:36:49.309
Really, these privileges, as you mentioned, are undeserved kindnesses from Jehovah.

00:36:49.309 --> 00:36:56.309
But now we turn our attention to Brother James Coffin, one of our Gilead instructors.

00:36:56.309 --> 00:37:00.309
And he spent a lot of time with you, dear ones, that you're in the last five months.

00:37:00.309 --> 00:37:05.309
You've gotten to know each other quite well, but you can have one more chance to talk to you.

00:37:05.309 --> 00:37:13.309
And he's going to speak on the intriguing theme in the shadows.

00:37:13.309 --> 00:37:16.309
We'll be interested to see how he develops that.

00:37:16.309 --> 00:37:23.710
He wasn't the most extraordinary among the apostles.

00:37:23.710 --> 00:37:26.710
For example, he didn't walk on water.

00:37:26.710 --> 00:37:29.710
He didn't receive the keys to the kingdom.

00:37:29.710 --> 00:37:32.710
He wasn't one of the sons of thunder.

00:37:32.710 --> 00:37:35.710
He didn't see the transfiguration.

00:37:35.710 --> 00:37:37.710
He didn't write a Bible book.

00:37:37.710 --> 00:37:43.710
In fact, all together, he's only mentioned 12 times in the Scriptures.

00:37:43.710 --> 00:37:47.710
And that's mostly when the list of all the apostles is given.

00:37:48.710 --> 00:37:50.710
Who are we talking about?

00:37:50.710 --> 00:37:53.710
That would be Andrew.

00:37:53.710 --> 00:38:00.710
See, Andrew was best known as the brother of Peter.

00:38:00.710 --> 00:38:04.710
That's what he was famous for, primarily.

00:38:04.710 --> 00:38:08.710
Peter's mentioned some 150 times in the Scripture.

00:38:08.710 --> 00:38:13.710
And it seems that Peter was always in the limelight,

00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:17.710
whereas Andrew always seemed to be in the shadows.

00:38:17.710 --> 00:38:19.710
Peter was extraordinary.

00:38:19.710 --> 00:38:22.710
Andrew was ordinary.

00:38:22.710 --> 00:38:29.710
Like Andrew, most of us view ourselves as just ordinary.

00:38:29.710 --> 00:38:32.710
We're not the valovictorian.

00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:35.710
We're not the greatest speaker.

00:38:35.710 --> 00:38:38.710
We're not miscongeniality.

00:38:38.710 --> 00:38:41.710
We're just in the shadows.

00:38:42.710 --> 00:38:45.710
But is that how Jehovah sees us?

00:38:45.710 --> 00:38:49.710
Is that how he saw Andrew?

00:38:49.710 --> 00:38:52.710
Let's look at Andrew, the person for just a minute.

00:38:52.710 --> 00:38:57.710
Open your Bibles, if you would, to John chapter one, please.

00:38:57.710 --> 00:38:59.710
John chapter one.

00:38:59.710 --> 00:39:03.710
And if you begin just following along with me, verse 35,

00:39:03.710 --> 00:39:09.710
we see that Andrew was a disciple of John the baptizer.

00:39:09.710 --> 00:39:13.710
And one day when he was with John the baptizer,

00:39:13.710 --> 00:39:18.710
John said, see the Lamb of God.

00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:22.710
What is it that Andrew did immediately?

00:39:22.710 --> 00:39:28.710
He immediately left following John to follow Jesus.

00:39:28.710 --> 00:39:31.710
Now, we don't have a lot of time for this talk.

00:39:31.710 --> 00:39:37.710
But what did Jehovah see in Andrew at that point?

00:39:37.710 --> 00:39:42.710
He must have seen that Andrew wanted to draw close to God

00:39:42.710 --> 00:39:47.710
and that he would be adaptable and that he would be willing to change

00:39:47.710 --> 00:39:53.710
in order to be able to draw closer to Jehovah and do his will.

00:39:53.710 --> 00:39:56.710
Jehovah must have loved Andrew for that attitude.

00:39:56.710 --> 00:40:03.590
If you follow along in verse 38 and 39,

00:40:04.590 --> 00:40:11.590
notice that it says, Jesus turned and saw them following him.

00:40:11.590 --> 00:40:14.590
And do you notice what Jesus said?

00:40:14.590 --> 00:40:17.590
He said, what are you looking for?

00:40:17.590 --> 00:40:20.590
Now, how did Andrew respond to that?

00:40:20.590 --> 00:40:24.590
Did Andrew say, well, you know, Lord,

00:40:24.590 --> 00:40:27.590
I'd like to have a better assignment,

00:40:27.590 --> 00:40:31.590
something that brings a little prestige, maybe some accolades,

00:40:31.590 --> 00:40:35.590
and along with that, if I had a bigger room,

00:40:35.590 --> 00:40:38.590
one with a view.

00:40:38.590 --> 00:40:40.590
But he didn't.

00:40:40.590 --> 00:40:43.590
What he said was, Lord, where are you staying?

00:40:43.590 --> 00:40:47.590
And the Bible shows us that Andrew then went with Jesus

00:40:47.590 --> 00:40:50.590
and stayed with him till about four o'clock in the afternoon.

00:40:50.590 --> 00:40:54.590
Now, that was interesting because he was really showing

00:40:54.590 --> 00:41:00.590
that he valued spiritual things over the mundane things.

00:41:00.590 --> 00:41:05.590
But then, after that time, verse 40 and 41,

00:41:05.590 --> 00:41:09.590
it says, Andrew ran to find his brother Peter,

00:41:09.590 --> 00:41:11.590
and he said, five words.

00:41:11.590 --> 00:41:14.590
Five words that would change their lives forever.

00:41:14.590 --> 00:41:18.590
We have found the Messiah.

00:41:18.590 --> 00:41:20.590
We have found the Messiah.

00:41:20.590 --> 00:41:22.590
Now, how did Andrew know that?

00:41:22.590 --> 00:41:26.590
Well, Andrew must have been a man who loved God's Word.

00:41:26.590 --> 00:41:28.590
He must have been familiar with it.

00:41:28.590 --> 00:41:32.590
And so in that time that he was with Jesus,

00:41:32.590 --> 00:41:36.590
he could take what he'd read in the scriptures

00:41:36.590 --> 00:41:39.590
and compare them with the man in front of him,

00:41:39.590 --> 00:41:42.590
and he came to that conclusion.

00:41:42.590 --> 00:41:44.590
He was a spiritual man.

00:41:44.590 --> 00:41:46.590
He loved God's Word.

00:41:46.590 --> 00:41:49.590
And as a result of his zeal,

00:41:49.590 --> 00:41:53.590
he brought his brother Peter to Jesus.

00:41:53.590 --> 00:41:56.590
Well, now, let's talk a little bit about what we know

00:41:56.590 --> 00:41:59.590
and what about Andrew the Apostle?

00:41:59.590 --> 00:42:05.280
Well, let's go over to John chapter 6 now.

00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:07.280
John chapter 6,

00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:11.280
and we'll look at verse 40 and 41.

00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:18.449
Oh, excuse me, John chapter 6 verses 5 through 9.

00:42:18.449 --> 00:42:21.449
And here, we see a large crowd of people now

00:42:21.449 --> 00:42:23.449
that are gathering to see Jesus.

00:42:23.449 --> 00:42:25.449
And Jesus wants to feed them.

00:42:25.449 --> 00:42:27.449
You remember the account.

00:42:27.449 --> 00:42:31.449
And so he says to fill up,

00:42:31.449 --> 00:42:33.449
you know, when feed these people,

00:42:33.449 --> 00:42:36.449
Philips says, Lord, that's impossible.

00:42:36.449 --> 00:42:38.449
200 didn't area.

00:42:38.449 --> 00:42:40.449
I wouldn't feed them all.

00:42:40.449 --> 00:42:43.449
So there was probably over 5,000 people there.

00:42:43.449 --> 00:42:45.449
But now while he,

00:42:45.449 --> 00:42:48.449
Philips is talking to Jesus trying to reason with him,

00:42:48.449 --> 00:42:50.449
what is Andrew doing?

00:42:50.449 --> 00:42:52.449
Andrew goes through the crowd.

00:42:52.449 --> 00:42:55.449
He finds a little boy that has some fish and some bread,

00:42:55.449 --> 00:42:58.449
and he brings that little child to Jesus.

00:42:58.449 --> 00:43:01.449
You have any idea what Jesus was going to do?

00:43:01.449 --> 00:43:03.449
He couldn't have known.

00:43:03.449 --> 00:43:06.920
There's no way he could have known.

00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:08.920
But he must have thought.

00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:13.920
He must have seen enough to know that Jesus could do something.

00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:15.920
And of course, he did.

00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:17.920
But what was the lesson?

00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:20.920
Well, while Philips saw the problem,

00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:23.920
Andrew was looking for a solution.

00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:26.920
And you may notice again that as usual,

00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:29.920
Andrew is bringing people to Jesus.

00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:33.460
Just as a side point,

00:43:33.460 --> 00:43:36.460
what do you think that little boy

00:43:36.460 --> 00:43:39.460
would be talking about when he became my age?

00:43:39.460 --> 00:43:42.460
Yeah, after that miracle he saw.

00:43:42.460 --> 00:43:45.460
It must have really been an impactful one.

00:43:45.460 --> 00:43:50.380
Now, let's go to John chapter 12.

00:43:50.380 --> 00:43:53.719
John chapter 12,

00:43:53.719 --> 00:43:56.719
and look down at verse 20 through 22.

00:43:56.719 --> 00:43:59.719
Because now we have a group of Greeks

00:43:59.719 --> 00:44:02.719
who have come to worship at the festival,

00:44:02.719 --> 00:44:04.719
and they approach Philip,

00:44:04.719 --> 00:44:05.719
and what do they want to do?

00:44:05.719 --> 00:44:07.719
They want to see Jesus.

00:44:07.719 --> 00:44:09.719
What does Philip do?

00:44:09.719 --> 00:44:11.719
Philip goes to Andrew.

00:44:11.719 --> 00:44:12.719
What does Andrew do?

00:44:12.719 --> 00:44:16.719
Andrew takes Philip and they go to Jesus.

00:44:16.719 --> 00:44:19.719
Now, two things.

00:44:19.719 --> 00:44:21.719
Number one,

00:44:21.719 --> 00:44:24.719
Andrew recognized the channel.

00:44:24.719 --> 00:44:26.719
He didn't try to circumvent it.

00:44:26.719 --> 00:44:28.719
He didn't try to make the decision.

00:44:28.719 --> 00:44:31.719
He recognized the channel.

00:44:31.719 --> 00:44:33.719
And secondly,

00:44:33.719 --> 00:44:35.719
Andrew was a friend.

00:44:35.719 --> 00:44:38.719
Because now he would be a mentor

00:44:38.719 --> 00:44:44.719
to Philip and teach him to go to the channel as well.

00:44:44.719 --> 00:44:46.719
Well,

00:44:46.719 --> 00:44:52.719
the Bible doesn't say much about Andrew,

00:44:52.719 --> 00:44:55.719
but we can see that Andrew didn't think it was all about him.

00:44:56.719 --> 00:44:59.719
He always had the desire to help others.

00:44:59.719 --> 00:45:03.719
So, in this brief discussion,

00:45:03.719 --> 00:45:09.119
is there anything really ordinary about Andrew?

00:45:09.119 --> 00:45:12.119
Not in Joseph's eyes.

00:45:12.119 --> 00:45:14.119
So while it's true,

00:45:14.119 --> 00:45:16.119
Andrew never walked on water.

00:45:16.119 --> 00:45:18.119
He never wrote a Bible book.

00:45:18.119 --> 00:45:21.119
He also never denied Christ.

00:45:21.119 --> 00:45:24.119
He never got his mom to ask for special favors.

00:45:24.119 --> 00:45:27.119
He was never known for being a doubting Andrew.

00:45:27.119 --> 00:45:30.119
And he never ever was called Satan.

00:45:30.119 --> 00:45:38.619
He was a force for good for those around him.

00:45:38.619 --> 00:45:42.619
Now, the lessons were the class.

00:45:42.619 --> 00:45:44.619
Be adaptable.

00:45:44.619 --> 00:45:48.619
Be adaptable to the leanings of Jehovah's Organization,

00:45:48.619 --> 00:45:51.619
even if you don't fully understand them.

00:45:51.619 --> 00:45:53.619
Number two,

00:45:53.619 --> 00:45:57.619
don't get tripped up by the desire for the mundane things.

00:45:57.619 --> 00:46:01.619
Remember the question that Jesus asked Andrew?

00:46:01.619 --> 00:46:03.619
What are you looking for?

00:46:03.619 --> 00:46:07.619
That's a good reset question for all of us from time to time.

00:46:07.619 --> 00:46:09.619
What are we looking for?

00:46:09.619 --> 00:46:11.619
Number three,

00:46:11.619 --> 00:46:16.619
remember that Jehovah is not limited in how he can work out problems.

00:46:16.619 --> 00:46:20.619
Give him the chance to show what he can do for you.

00:46:20.619 --> 00:46:25.619
And you may find the answer comes in some very unexpected ways.

00:46:25.619 --> 00:46:29.619
And finally, in your assignment,

00:46:29.619 --> 00:46:34.619
don't be quick to pass over this seemingly ordinary people.

00:46:34.619 --> 00:46:36.619
Look for the Andrews.

00:46:36.619 --> 00:46:38.619
They're in all the congregations.

00:46:38.619 --> 00:46:40.619
They're in all the Bethels.

00:46:40.619 --> 00:46:45.619
They're like the hidden gems that are all around us.

00:46:45.619 --> 00:46:47.619
Acknowledge them.

00:46:47.619 --> 00:46:49.619
Encourage them.

00:46:49.619 --> 00:46:52.619
See what they're contributing.

00:46:52.619 --> 00:46:55.619
And say something about it.

00:46:55.619 --> 00:46:58.619
And those hidden gems will begin to come out of the shadows.

00:46:58.619 --> 00:47:02.619
And they will shine in the light of appreciation.

00:47:02.619 --> 00:47:04.619
So in the days to come,

00:47:04.619 --> 00:47:07.619
be a steady force for good.

00:47:07.619 --> 00:47:10.619
Show loving kindness to all.

00:47:10.619 --> 00:47:12.619
Give Jehovah your best.

00:47:12.619 --> 00:47:15.619
And give the friends your best.

00:47:15.619 --> 00:47:17.619
And give it with love.

00:47:17.619 --> 00:47:23.619
And you will never ever be in the shadow in Jehovah's eyes.

00:47:23.619 --> 00:47:30.940
Well, thank you very much.

00:47:30.940 --> 00:47:34.940
We really appreciate that to talk with their coffin,

00:47:34.940 --> 00:47:38.940
helping us all to be like Andrew.

00:47:38.940 --> 00:47:41.940
Very happy to serve quietly in the background,

00:47:41.940 --> 00:47:44.940
not striving to be in the limelight.

00:47:44.940 --> 00:47:46.940
We really appreciate it.

00:47:46.940 --> 00:47:47.940
Very practical.

00:47:47.940 --> 00:47:51.940
But now, we're going to turn our attention to Brother Mark Numer.

00:47:51.940 --> 00:47:54.940
He's a helper to the teaching committee,

00:47:54.940 --> 00:47:56.940
but also one of our gillied instructors.

00:47:56.940 --> 00:47:58.940
You spend a lot of time with him also.

00:47:58.940 --> 00:48:01.940
But he has a booming theme.

00:48:01.940 --> 00:48:07.889
Will you thunder for Jehovah?

00:48:07.889 --> 00:48:10.889
And now from Andrew to John.

00:48:10.889 --> 00:48:12.889
The Apostle John.

00:48:12.889 --> 00:48:16.889
He was living at a most critical time.

00:48:16.889 --> 00:48:18.889
The last surviving Apostle.

00:48:18.889 --> 00:48:22.889
He was helping to hold back a tidal wave of worldly influence

00:48:22.889 --> 00:48:27.889
and apostate thinking that was already eroding the Christian congregation

00:48:27.889 --> 00:48:32.170
under divine inspiration.

00:48:32.170 --> 00:48:36.170
John wrote a most vigorous letter to his brothers.

00:48:36.170 --> 00:48:40.170
We can still sense in him that fiery enthusiasm

00:48:40.170 --> 00:48:45.170
that earned him his name, Son of Thunder.

00:48:45.170 --> 00:48:49.170
And that letter, the letter that we're going to look at right now,

00:48:49.170 --> 00:48:55.170
will show you, you like John can thunder for Jehovah.

00:48:55.170 --> 00:48:57.170
Well, how can you do that?

00:48:57.170 --> 00:48:58.170
Let's find out.

00:48:58.170 --> 00:49:01.170
We're going to open up now to 1 John chapter 1.

00:49:01.170 --> 00:49:04.170
We're going to read verse 1 and 3.

00:49:04.170 --> 00:49:10.170
And watch how John makes very clear his objective right from the outset.

00:49:10.170 --> 00:49:13.170
1 John 1 verse 1.

00:49:13.170 --> 00:49:16.170
That which was from the beginning.

00:49:16.170 --> 00:49:19.170
Now the beginning was with Christ Jesus

00:49:19.170 --> 00:49:21.170
and his pre-human existence.

00:49:21.170 --> 00:49:24.170
He was the firstborn of all creation.

00:49:24.170 --> 00:49:30.170
We have heard which we have seen with our eyes,

00:49:30.170 --> 00:49:34.170
which we have observed and our hands have felt him.

00:49:34.170 --> 00:49:39.170
And notice that John right away wants to grab the attention of the brothers

00:49:39.170 --> 00:49:42.170
and to say, look, we heard him.

00:49:42.170 --> 00:49:44.170
We've seen him with our eyes.

00:49:44.170 --> 00:49:45.170
We've observed him.

00:49:45.170 --> 00:49:46.170
I felt him.

00:49:46.170 --> 00:49:47.170
I touched him.

00:49:47.170 --> 00:49:50.170
I laid my head in his chest.

00:49:50.170 --> 00:49:54.170
Did John even hear his heartbeat?

00:49:54.170 --> 00:49:58.170
Well, the fact is that these messages were so clear to John

00:49:58.170 --> 00:50:00.170
and he wanted to make it known.

00:50:00.170 --> 00:50:02.170
Notice verse 3.

00:50:02.170 --> 00:50:06.170
That which we have seen and heard again, John repeats this.

00:50:06.170 --> 00:50:08.170
His teachings, I saw them.

00:50:08.170 --> 00:50:09.170
I heard them.

00:50:09.170 --> 00:50:13.170
I'm so convinced that God's powers operating through him

00:50:13.170 --> 00:50:16.170
that there in verse 3, John says,

00:50:16.170 --> 00:50:20.170
we are reporting also to you.

00:50:20.170 --> 00:50:22.170
I'm reporting this to you, John said.

00:50:22.170 --> 00:50:26.170
John had such good reason to thunder.

00:50:26.170 --> 00:50:28.170
He was a living link to Christ.

00:50:28.170 --> 00:50:33.170
The brothers alive at that time did not have the privilege that John had to walk

00:50:33.170 --> 00:50:37.170
and to touch and to be taught by Jesus personally.

00:50:37.170 --> 00:50:38.170
But John did.

00:50:38.170 --> 00:50:42.170
And he was so moved by these experiences that he wanted to report

00:50:42.170 --> 00:50:46.170
these real life experiences about Christ.

00:50:46.170 --> 00:50:47.170
But why?

00:50:47.170 --> 00:50:49.170
To protect his brothers.

00:50:49.170 --> 00:50:53.170
To protect his beloved brothers from the false teachers

00:50:53.170 --> 00:50:58.170
at that time who were trying to draw them away from the truth.

00:50:58.170 --> 00:51:02.170
You see, John spoke up against lies that the apostates

00:51:02.170 --> 00:51:06.170
and the other false teachers were spreading in his day.

00:51:06.170 --> 00:51:11.170
They were telling disgusting lies about God in Jesus.

00:51:11.170 --> 00:51:16.170
They craftily constructed speeches designed to corrupt the teachings of Christ.

00:51:16.170 --> 00:51:18.170
John knew that.

00:51:18.170 --> 00:51:19.170
He felt it.

00:51:19.170 --> 00:51:23.170
They even claimed to have secret revelations and superior knowledge

00:51:23.170 --> 00:51:29.170
and they boast that they were the correctors of the apostles, liars.

00:51:29.170 --> 00:51:33.170
And John could not stomach liars.

00:51:33.170 --> 00:51:38.170
And it is of interest out of the 15 times the Bible used the word liar.

00:51:38.170 --> 00:51:41.170
He used the word eight times.

00:51:41.170 --> 00:51:47.170
You see, John continued to thunder, defend and speak out for the truth.

00:51:47.170 --> 00:51:51.170
Because he loved the truth, he loved Christ Jesus,

00:51:51.170 --> 00:51:56.449
and he loved the Father Jehovah.

00:51:56.449 --> 00:52:04.110
Similarly today, lies and false reports against the truth abound.

00:52:04.110 --> 00:52:10.110
And enemies of the truth use any means to try to smear the reputation of Christ's brothers.

00:52:11.110 --> 00:52:13.110
But now what's the point?

00:52:13.110 --> 00:52:18.110
Your time here at World Headquarters, your time with the governing body,

00:52:18.110 --> 00:52:22.110
your time with the responsible brothers from World Headquarters,

00:52:22.110 --> 00:52:25.110
convinces you firsthand.

00:52:25.110 --> 00:52:31.110
Had any negative reports that you hear about the organization are lies.

00:52:31.110 --> 00:52:35.110
And now you can thunder for Jehovah by defending the truth about those

00:52:35.110 --> 00:52:39.110
whom Christ appointed to take the lead in his organization.

00:52:40.110 --> 00:52:42.110
And look what you've been able to do.

00:52:42.110 --> 00:52:45.110
You can say just like John, look, I've heard.

00:52:45.110 --> 00:52:46.110
I've seen.

00:52:46.110 --> 00:52:47.110
I've observed.

00:52:47.110 --> 00:52:48.110
I've felt that is me.

00:52:48.110 --> 00:52:50.110
I've had a close-up view.

00:52:50.110 --> 00:52:55.110
This is even a closer look than you can have Hunche W. Broadcasting.

00:52:55.110 --> 00:52:57.110
This is one-on-one in the flesh.

00:52:57.110 --> 00:53:05.389
And you can say, I've had a close-up view of God's spirit-directed organization.

00:53:05.389 --> 00:53:11.389
And now I am reporting to you, my beloved brothers and sisters

00:53:11.389 --> 00:53:12.389
and the assignments that you have.

00:53:12.389 --> 00:53:14.389
That's what you can do now.

00:53:14.389 --> 00:53:16.389
What I have seen and I've heard.

00:53:16.389 --> 00:53:21.389
And in this way, imagine what you can do to strengthen, stabilize,

00:53:21.389 --> 00:53:25.389
and build confidence in your brothers.

00:53:25.389 --> 00:53:27.389
This is your responsibility now.

00:53:27.389 --> 00:53:30.389
This wasn't coming here to school just to have a good time.

00:53:30.389 --> 00:53:33.389
I know you did have a good time, but that wasn't the objective.

00:53:34.389 --> 00:53:37.389
The objective is now that you go out and you serve your brothers.

00:53:37.389 --> 00:53:39.389
All of you, each and every one of you,

00:53:39.389 --> 00:53:42.389
brother, sister, single, married, it doesn't matter.

00:53:42.389 --> 00:53:47.389
Your brothers and sisters now deserve a Gilead graduates' reward.

00:53:47.389 --> 00:53:49.389
And you're going to give it to them.

00:53:49.389 --> 00:53:52.389
And you thunder in doing that.

00:53:52.389 --> 00:53:58.920
Now, let's go back to the Apostle John.

00:53:58.920 --> 00:54:02.920
You see, John's thunder never diminished to a low rumble.

00:54:02.920 --> 00:54:04.920
Think about it.

00:54:05.920 --> 00:54:09.920
What did John do when he was released from prison on the island of Patmos

00:54:09.920 --> 00:54:11.920
at nearly 100 years old?

00:54:11.920 --> 00:54:13.920
What did he do?

00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:15.920
I mean, did he say, I'm a weak old man?

00:54:15.920 --> 00:54:17.920
There's nothing I can do anymore.

00:54:17.920 --> 00:54:19.920
No, no, no.

00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:21.920
You see, he knew the apostasy was coming,

00:54:21.920 --> 00:54:25.920
and that oppressive wolves were already misleading the brothers.

00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:31.920
But John said, not on my watch.

00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:34.920
And he would continue to thunder for Jehovah

00:54:34.920 --> 00:54:37.920
by using his every fiber of his being

00:54:37.920 --> 00:54:41.920
to help his brothers write down to his dying breath.

00:54:41.920 --> 00:54:44.920
How did he do that?

00:54:44.920 --> 00:54:48.920
He wrote four Bible books,

00:54:48.920 --> 00:54:51.920
and including the portion that we just read here

00:54:51.920 --> 00:54:54.920
in 1 John 1.

00:54:54.920 --> 00:54:56.920
He didn't retire.

00:54:56.920 --> 00:54:59.920
He was still full of fiery enthusiasm,

00:54:59.920 --> 00:55:03.920
wanting to help his brothers because he loved the truth.

00:55:03.920 --> 00:55:07.920
But what helped John to keep the thunder rolling?

00:55:07.920 --> 00:55:09.920
What helped him?

00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:15.920
He knew the final outcome.

00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:19.920
You see, in 96 CE, before his release,

00:55:19.920 --> 00:55:23.920
he received that unexpected flash of light,

00:55:23.920 --> 00:55:28.920
the revelation, a vision of 144,000

00:55:28.920 --> 00:55:32.920
kingdom conquerors who will rule with Jesus in heaven.

00:55:32.920 --> 00:55:34.920
He got that.

00:55:34.920 --> 00:55:38.920
Then he was told about an integrity keeping great crowd

00:55:38.920 --> 00:55:41.920
out of all the nations that would worship God in truth.

00:55:41.920 --> 00:55:43.920
He got that.

00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:46.920
Can you imagine how that strengthened his conviction

00:55:46.920 --> 00:55:48.920
that in spite of the apostasy,

00:55:48.920 --> 00:55:53.920
he said true worship would not be extinguished?

00:55:53.920 --> 00:55:57.389
So think about it.

00:55:58.389 --> 00:56:01.389
If a prophetic vision

00:56:01.389 --> 00:56:05.389
of the great crowd encouraged John to continue to fight

00:56:05.389 --> 00:56:07.389
and defend the truth,

00:56:07.389 --> 00:56:09.389
what about you?

00:56:09.389 --> 00:56:12.389
You who see, not a vision,

00:56:12.389 --> 00:56:15.389
but the reality of its fulfillment.

00:56:15.389 --> 00:56:18.389
Now John is seeing the reality from heaven, true,

00:56:18.389 --> 00:56:22.389
but you have a front row seat right here on earth.

00:56:22.389 --> 00:56:26.389
As you witness, the greatest preaching effort in history

00:56:26.389 --> 00:56:29.389
and you watched Jehovah perform a modern day miracle

00:56:29.389 --> 00:56:34.389
by gathering a great crowd from all the nations.

00:56:34.389 --> 00:56:37.389
No matter what we face now,

00:56:37.389 --> 00:56:39.389
or in the future,

00:56:39.389 --> 00:56:42.389
keep the thunder rolling.

00:56:42.389 --> 00:56:44.389
Why?

00:56:44.389 --> 00:56:48.389
Because you know the final outcome.

00:56:48.389 --> 00:56:52.599
You see it already developing.

00:56:52.599 --> 00:56:56.599
John continued to thunder for Jehovah,

00:56:56.599 --> 00:57:01.599
but he mellowed through the years of faithful service.

00:57:01.599 --> 00:57:07.599
His fiery enthusiasm is now on display in perfect balance.

00:57:07.599 --> 00:57:10.599
A man who once wanted to call down fire from heaven

00:57:10.599 --> 00:57:18.599
to get results now uses a force much stronger and more effective.

00:57:18.599 --> 00:57:20.599
What is it?

00:57:20.599 --> 00:57:22.599
Love.

00:57:22.599 --> 00:57:26.599
First John chapter 2 and verse 14.

00:57:26.599 --> 00:57:28.599
Notice what he says here,

00:57:28.599 --> 00:57:34.980
and just sense the love that he has when he writes verse 14.

00:57:34.980 --> 00:57:36.980
I write to you, fathers,

00:57:36.980 --> 00:57:41.980
because you have come to know him who is from the beginning.

00:57:41.980 --> 00:57:43.980
I write to you young men,

00:57:43.980 --> 00:57:45.980
because you are strong.

00:57:45.980 --> 00:57:48.980
The word of God remains in you,

00:57:48.980 --> 00:57:51.980
and you have conquered the wicked one.

00:57:51.980 --> 00:57:53.980
Can you sense the love?

00:57:53.980 --> 00:57:55.980
John is saying, look,

00:57:55.980 --> 00:57:57.980
the word of God remains in you.

00:57:57.980 --> 00:58:01.980
He used a powerful force of love to commend his readers,

00:58:01.980 --> 00:58:05.980
because they never lost their heartfelt appreciation for the truth.

00:58:05.980 --> 00:58:08.980
Can you see yourself doing that?

00:58:08.980 --> 00:58:12.980
You see, thunder without love is just noise.

00:58:12.980 --> 00:58:18.980
But be determined to lovingly commend your brothers for their endurance.

00:58:18.980 --> 00:58:20.980
Accept them for their integrity.

00:58:20.980 --> 00:58:23.980
Commend them for their unselfish love.

00:58:23.980 --> 00:58:26.980
Touch their hearts when you speak with them.

00:58:26.980 --> 00:58:29.980
Our brothers need encouragement,

00:58:29.980 --> 00:58:34.730
not criticism.

00:58:34.730 --> 00:58:37.730
Well, as I look at each one of you,

00:58:37.730 --> 00:58:40.730
I have a lot of thoughts going through my mind.

00:58:40.730 --> 00:58:42.730
I do.

00:58:42.730 --> 00:58:46.730
I mean, all of the memories are flooding through my mind,

00:58:46.730 --> 00:58:48.730
flooding through my heart.

00:58:48.730 --> 00:58:50.730
It's amazing.

00:58:50.730 --> 00:58:52.730
I look at you.

00:58:52.730 --> 00:58:54.730
I can still hear your comments.

00:58:54.730 --> 00:58:56.730
But you know what else I can hear?

00:58:56.730 --> 00:59:01.730
I can hear each day when you came to class how you thundered into that classroom.

00:59:01.730 --> 00:59:03.730
You did.

00:59:03.730 --> 00:59:06.730
I have never seen such a thunderous class.

00:59:06.730 --> 00:59:09.730
There you are each morning hugging each other,

00:59:09.730 --> 00:59:11.730
clapping for their morning worship comments,

00:59:11.730 --> 00:59:13.730
commending each other.

00:59:13.730 --> 00:59:15.730
It's as if you hadn't seen each other in three months.

00:59:15.730 --> 00:59:17.730
It was just last night.

00:59:17.730 --> 00:59:19.730
You saw each other.

00:59:19.730 --> 00:59:24.730
You thundered in appreciation for divine truth

00:59:24.730 --> 00:59:26.730
and for the privilege to be here at school

00:59:26.730 --> 00:59:30.730
and for each other's integrity keeping course.

00:59:30.730 --> 00:59:32.730
Now, as you leave,

00:59:32.730 --> 00:59:34.730
what do we want you to remember?

00:59:34.730 --> 00:59:38.730
We want you to remember how you can keep the thunder rolling.

00:59:38.730 --> 00:59:40.730
How can you do that?

00:59:40.730 --> 00:59:42.730
I'm going to give you three ways.

00:59:42.730 --> 00:59:47.940
One, defend the truth.

00:59:47.940 --> 00:59:50.940
Don't allow false reports and lies about the organization

00:59:50.940 --> 00:59:53.940
that you love, the organization that you love and cherish,

00:59:53.940 --> 00:59:58.940
the very organization that brought you to these seats.

00:59:58.940 --> 01:00:01.940
Never allow lies and false reports to stop you

01:00:01.940 --> 01:00:06.940
from reporting what you have seen and heard firsthand.

01:00:06.940 --> 01:00:09.940
Two, remember the final outcome.

01:00:09.940 --> 01:00:11.940
True worship will prevail.

01:00:11.940 --> 01:00:15.940
You already see it doing so.

01:00:15.940 --> 01:00:19.940
And three, use the powerful force of love.

01:00:20.940 --> 01:00:23.940
Use love to command and fortify your brothers,

01:00:23.940 --> 01:00:25.940
encourage them, build them up.

01:00:25.940 --> 01:00:27.940
Use love.

01:00:27.940 --> 01:00:30.940
And like John, with all your might,

01:00:30.940 --> 01:00:41.139
with all your ability, thunder for Jehovah.

01:00:41.139 --> 01:00:44.139
That was thunderous applause.

01:00:44.139 --> 01:00:47.139
You followed his theme right on through.

01:00:47.139 --> 01:00:48.139
Very good.

01:00:48.139 --> 01:00:51.139
And we really did appreciate that talk,

01:00:51.139 --> 01:00:54.139
helping us to be like the Apostle John

01:00:54.139 --> 01:00:57.139
and how he never lost his enthusiasm.

01:00:57.139 --> 01:01:02.139
But he balanced it even more so in later years with love.

01:01:02.139 --> 01:01:07.139
So we want to never lose our enthusiasm, our love,

01:01:07.139 --> 01:01:12.139
for Jehovah, Jesus, the kingdom, and spiritual things.

01:01:12.139 --> 01:01:15.139
What an inspiring program.

01:01:15.139 --> 01:01:17.139
And there's more to come.

01:01:17.139 --> 01:01:20.139
Look for parts two and three on JW.org.

01:01:20.139 --> 01:01:23.139
They'll be released in the coming weeks.

01:01:23.139 --> 01:01:26.139
From the world headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses,

01:01:26.139 --> 01:01:29.139
this is JW Broadcasting.
