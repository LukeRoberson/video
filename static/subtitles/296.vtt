WEBVTT

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:07.950
We were serving in a small town in Alberta,

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:09.949
and then we began having children.

00:00:09.949 --> 00:00:13.949
When we moved to Craig, we had four children,

00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:17.949
and after living here, we now have nine children.

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:22.949
You're given this trust, and so as a parent,

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.949
you need to put the kingdom first.

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:26.949
You need to set a good example.

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:28.949
You need to be at the meetings.

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.949
You need to be regular in field service.

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.950
We really believed that we needed to love Jehovah first

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.950
in order to be a good example to our children.

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.950
They helped us see that what would make us happy

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:43.950
were spiritual things.

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.950
My parents more in action than in words

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.950
taught us to seek first the kingdom.

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.950
With nine kids, it's always going to be hectic.

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:56.950
You have extra children. You have more excuses, perhaps.

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:00.950
Having nine children is a challenge in a million ways.

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:11.540
And yet, yeah, she had moments where she'd sit in her rocking chair

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.540
and just look so exhausted.

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.540
I remember one time when it was time to go to the meeting,

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.540
but I was so exhausted, and I thought of Isaiah 40,

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.540
where Jehovah says that those hoping and Jehovah will regain power.

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.540
So I figured, Jehovah wants me to do it.

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.540
She's going to make me strong enough to do this, so I prayed,

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:35.540
and I got ready.

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:42.739
It's a scramble.

00:01:42.739 --> 00:01:46.739
In Hebrews, we see the encouragement to never forsake

00:01:46.739 --> 00:01:48.739
our meeting together.

00:01:48.739 --> 00:01:50.739
My dad always spoke of that.

00:01:50.739 --> 00:01:54.739
There was a time that we had to travel in the winter time

00:01:54.739 --> 00:01:58.739
maybe up to two hours to get to the meeting.

00:01:58.739 --> 00:02:01.739
You'd come back to your home late at night

00:02:01.739 --> 00:02:05.739
with all these kids that are worn out in yourself too.

00:02:06.739 --> 00:02:10.740
Seeing the importance that they placed on the meetings,

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:15.740
I was able to see that you never take meetings for granted.

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.740
My parents always instilled in us the consistency

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.740
with service just like meetings.

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.740
It just was what we did.

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.740
That wasn't a question that we got up on Saturday morning

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.740
and we got ourselves out the door and in service.

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.740
We couldn't simply just be backseat ornament.

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:42.740
We knew that we were there to give a witness.

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.740
From an early age, we were really following the example

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.740
of our parents in showing interest in people.

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:53.740
So because of that, we enjoyed being in the ministry.

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:55.740
It gave me a sense of purpose.

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:57.740
I had people to go visit and service.

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.740
I had to know what I was going to talk to them about

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:02.740
and have a plan.

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.740
In field service, we would often take breaks

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.740
for the sake of the children and ourselves.

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:13.740
It was important to have our children enjoy field service,

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:18.740
not push them hard and be too rigid and so forth.

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.740
I think about Proverbs 22 verse 6

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:23.740
and the Bindington translation,

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:28.740
where it says to give a boy the start his course requires.

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:32.740
They did that by putting the spiritual things

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:35.740
before the material things.

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:39.740
Java helped us to be the best parents we could be.

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:44.740
We failed at times, but I always knew that Java was the best parent.

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:48.740
So if we could teach them to love him, then he would take over.

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:53.210
Well, we as a family were successful

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:56.210
because we did have Jehovah in our lives.

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:59.210
All our children were doing very well in the truth,

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:01.210
and so we're very happy about that,

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:04.210
and I'm sure it makes Jehovah happy.
