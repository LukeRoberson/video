00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.980
I'm so tired.

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:09.420
I'm really not up to talking to anyone tonight.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.739
All I want to do is just find my seat and enjoy the meeting.

00:01:13.739 --> 00:01:16.859
I know Jehovah will understand if I just ran.

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:18.260
I am so glad to see you.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.500
I could really use your help with preparing for my next Bible study with Lori.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.500
Well, actually, you know, I was trying to just get to my...

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.299
Okay, so let me tell you.

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:26.299
Wow.

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:30.019
She didn't even hear me.

00:01:30.019 --> 00:01:32.900
I don't need this right now.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.540
This is really trying my patience.

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:43.700
But how many times was Jesus interrupted when he was tired?

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.780
Love is patient and kind.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.500
Let me listen closely to what she has to say.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.260
That's when I remember what you told me.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:52.260
Really?

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:53.260
What did I say?

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.980
Remember, you said always be patient and kind.

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:00.859
So I kindly pointed out the key words of Scripture and then after asking her the question

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:05.739
again, I patiently waited for her to give me an answer, which, by the way, is not the

00:02:05.739 --> 00:02:07.780
easiest thing for me to do.

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.900
But just when I thought that I couldn't wait any longer, she gave me the right answer.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:12.900
She got the point.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.900
I was so excited.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.419
But now I'm kind of wondering, does she really believe what she said?

00:02:18.419 --> 00:02:20.900
And if not, how am I going to help her to see the truth of the matter?

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.539
And that's where I need your help, Joanne.

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:24.060
I've been trying to look for articles.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.060
I can't find anything.

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.860
Joanne, can you please help me with finding an article on how to reason with a Bible

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:29.860
student?

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:30.860
Of course.

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.379
I would be glad to help you.

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:35.539
Could we get together maybe tomorrow afternoon?

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:37.979
Thank you so much, Joanne, for being willing to help me.

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:39.740
I really appreciate it.

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:40.740
Thank you.

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:52.930
Bill, Carl, how are you?

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:53.930
Good.

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:54.930
How are you feeling?

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:55.930
Good.

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:56.930
Awesome.

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.129
Alex, I didn't get a chance to tell you last week, but that was a really nice job you

00:02:58.129 --> 00:02:59.129
did on your talk.

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:00.129
Yeah.

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:01.129
Good job.

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:02.129
Oh, thanks, guys.

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:03.129
Believe me, I've been so busy.

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:04.729
It was hard to make time to prepare it.

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:05.729
Oh, tell me about it.

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:08.129
I think the whole congregation has had a lot going on lately.

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:09.129
Yeah, it has.

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:11.810
That's true, but I think I've been extra busy.

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:12.810
Why?

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:13.810
It was going on.

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:14.810
You're not sick, are you?

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:15.810
No, no.

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:16.810
It's nothing like that.

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:23.169
It's all this theocratic stuff, pioneering, congregation duties, and other things, like

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:27.889
this Saturday I need to beat the Kingdom Hall all afternoon and Saturday here.

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:28.889
Why?

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:29.889
Wait a second.

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:30.889
I see where this is going.

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:33.650
Isn't there a circuit assembly rehearsal here on Saturday?

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:34.650
Oh, yeah.

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:35.650
That's right.

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:36.650
So you're in the program.

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.449
Well, I'm not sure if I'm supposed to say it.

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:39.449
I just did.

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:40.449
So what is it?

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:43.530
You're in a demonstration of interview.

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.129
You can't just leave us hanging.

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:46.129
OK.

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:47.129
Well, it's not just an interview.

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:49.530
It's an interview with a reenactment.

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.050
And then they're going to ask me questions at the end.

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:54.370
I'm actually on stage for most of the part.

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.810
Come to think of it, guys, I am the part.

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:58.889
You are the part.

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:01.449
You sure you're not stretching that a little bit?

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:03.009
No, I don't think I am.

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:06.050
OK, Brother Jones' part is 10 minutes.

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:08.409
I'm up there for six.

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:11.370
That's more than half the part.

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.370
Anyway, so let me tell you how it's supposed to go.

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:14.849
They're going to ask me about this time.

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:16.689
I did this amazing job out in Field Service.

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:17.689
I walk up to the door.

00:04:17.689 --> 00:04:18.930
Of course, I ring the bell.

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:19.449
But what happens?

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:30.110
It doesn't work.

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:31.990
Bill, Carl, how are you?

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.310
Good.

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.790
How are you feeling?

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:33.310
Good.

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.790
Awesome.

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:36.029
Alex, I didn't get a chance to tell you last week,

00:04:36.029 --> 00:04:37.910
but that was a really nice job you did on your talk.

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:38.790
Yeah, good job.

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:40.110
Thanks, guys.

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.189
With Jehovah's help, it came together.

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:44.069
Believe me, I've been so busy.

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:45.709
It was hard to make time to prepare it.

00:04:45.709 --> 00:04:46.629
Oh, tell me about it.

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:49.069
I think the whole congregation has had a lot going on lately.

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:49.829
Yeah, it has.

00:04:49.829 --> 00:04:52.269
You both would know, aren't you both auxiliary pioneering?

00:04:52.269 --> 00:04:53.110
How's that going?

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.949
It's going.

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:56.709
Actually, yesterday I was able to show one of our JW.org

00:04:56.709 --> 00:04:57.750
videos with a man.

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:59.629
He said I can come back this Saturday.

00:04:59.629 --> 00:05:01.949
I think he might even agree to a study.

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:03.230
You want to come with me, Alex?

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.990
You know, I'm sorry.

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:05.870
I'm going to be tied up for most of this Saturday,

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:07.670
but maybe Bill can come with.

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:08.550
How about it, Bill?

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:09.069
Sure.

00:05:09.069 --> 00:05:09.990
I have a call to make, too.

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:11.430
Maybe we can do both calls together.

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:12.230
All right, deal.

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:14.149
So Bill, you got a good call, too.

00:05:14.149 --> 00:05:15.470
Tell us about it.

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:33.740
Brother Harris, do you have a moment?

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:34.699
Sure, Fay.

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:35.579
How can we help you?

00:05:35.579 --> 00:05:37.259
Well, you probably heard by now.

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:39.300
David and I got engaged this past weekend.

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:40.300
We heard.

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:41.620
Congratulations.

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:43.259
We're so happy for both of you.

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:44.620
Thanks so much.

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:45.939
And since this is where I grew up,

00:05:45.939 --> 00:05:47.860
it would mean a lot to us if we could get married

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:49.540
in this kingdom hall.

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:51.220
So we were hoping since you're the coordinator

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:54.899
of the body of elders, you'd be able to let us know today

00:05:54.899 --> 00:05:56.139
if we can use the hall.

00:05:56.139 --> 00:05:57.379
Then David and I can start working

00:05:57.379 --> 00:05:59.339
on our wedding invitations.

00:05:59.339 --> 00:06:00.699
David asked me to give you this letter.

00:06:00.699 --> 00:06:09.660
Making our official request.

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:10.860
Oh, yeah.

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:11.779
This is a good letter.

00:06:11.779 --> 00:06:14.620
This gives me all the information I need.

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:19.420
And Fay, I can't imagine you getting married anywhere else.

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:21.500
You can count on the kingdom hall.

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:24.579
And I'll let the elders know I've already given my approval.

00:06:24.579 --> 00:06:28.939
But let David know we're looking forward to your big day.

00:06:28.939 --> 00:06:30.220
Thanks so much, Brother Harris.

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:47.879
I knew you'd come through for me.

00:06:47.879 --> 00:06:49.639
Brother Harris, do you have a moment?

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:50.600
Sure, Fay.

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:51.439
How can we help you?

00:06:51.439 --> 00:06:53.120
Well, you probably heard by now.

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.160
David and I got engaged this past weekend.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.480
We heard, congratulations.

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:59.160
We're so happy for both of you.

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:00.480
Thanks so much.

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:01.800
And since this is where I grew up,

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:03.720
it would mean a lot to us if we could get married

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:05.399
in this kingdom hall.

00:07:05.399 --> 00:07:07.079
So we were hoping since you're the coordinator

00:07:07.079 --> 00:07:10.759
of the body of elders, you'd be able to let us know today

00:07:10.759 --> 00:07:12.000
if we can use the hall.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.240
Then David and I can start working

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:15.199
on our wedding invitations.

00:07:15.199 --> 00:07:16.560
David asked me to give you this letter.

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:24.500
Making our official request.

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:25.740
Yes, this is a good letter.

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:28.379
This has all the information that we need.

00:07:28.379 --> 00:07:30.100
I'm going to check with the other elders

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:31.500
and we're going to discuss it.

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:33.459
Then we'll get right back to you.

00:07:33.459 --> 00:07:36.300
Oh, you mean you can't tell me right now?

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:37.540
I thought since you're the coordinator,

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:39.939
you'd have the authority to, you know.

00:07:39.939 --> 00:07:43.379
I understand, but there is a theoretical arrangement

00:07:43.379 --> 00:07:46.339
that we all have to follow, even the elders.

00:07:46.339 --> 00:07:49.819
And the arrangement is for the entire service committee

00:07:49.819 --> 00:07:52.819
to discuss this, consider the matter thoroughly,

00:07:52.819 --> 00:07:54.939
and before any approval is given.

00:07:54.939 --> 00:07:58.980
So I don't have the authority to make a decision on my own.

00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:00.500
Of course, that makes sense.

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:01.459
I understand.

00:08:01.459 --> 00:08:02.459
But don't worry, Faith.

00:08:02.459 --> 00:08:05.139
We're going to get on this as soon as possible.

00:08:05.139 --> 00:08:07.699
Then you can move forward with your wedding plans.

00:08:07.699 --> 00:08:09.019
Thank you so much for the Harris.

00:08:09.019 --> 00:08:10.379
I really appreciate it.

00:08:10.379 --> 00:08:14.259
You're welcome.

00:08:14.259 --> 00:08:15.620
I'm going to get started right on this.

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:22.310
OK.

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:23.949
Excuse me.

00:08:23.949 --> 00:08:26.949
Larry, Frank, have either of you seen Kevin tonight?

00:08:26.949 --> 00:08:29.589
Yes, he's over by the literature counter.

00:08:29.589 --> 00:08:30.110
OK.

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:31.189
I can go get him if you'd like.

00:08:31.189 --> 00:08:32.070
Oh, that would be great.

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:33.870
Thank you very much.

00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:37.230
Larry, perhaps you've heard, a fake harder

00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:41.110
and David Thomas have recently gotten engaged,

00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:43.590
and they want to use the kingdom hall for their wedding.

00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:46.029
So perhaps you and Kevin and myself

00:08:46.029 --> 00:08:48.470
we could get together for a few minutes tonight,

00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:51.710
and then they could move forward with their wedding plans.

00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:53.830
Tonight?

00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:56.789
How many times are you going to do this to us, Tom?

00:08:56.789 --> 00:08:57.950
Do what?

00:08:57.950 --> 00:09:00.789
Keep having these unscheduled meetings.

00:09:00.789 --> 00:09:03.470
Look, maybe you're not so eager to get home

00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:06.590
and spend time with your family, but some of us are.

00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:10.149
Not want to spend time with my family?

00:09:10.149 --> 00:09:12.710
What is that supposed to mean?

00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:15.309
He is way out of line.

00:09:15.309 --> 00:09:18.429
I should set him straight right now.

00:09:18.429 --> 00:09:22.190
No, wait.

00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:24.909
What am I thinking?

00:09:24.909 --> 00:09:27.870
If I react poorly right now, I could

00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:33.350
cause a major rift between us, even between our families.

00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:36.870
And if we elders don't show love among ourselves,

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:41.029
imagine how this could affect the congregation.

00:09:41.029 --> 00:09:45.429
What a dishonor that would be to Jehovah in Jesus.

00:09:45.429 --> 00:09:47.870
What do the Scriptures say?

00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:51.269
Do not leave your place.

00:09:51.269 --> 00:09:56.549
Love does not become provoked.

00:09:56.549 --> 00:09:59.190
You're right, Larry.

00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:00.750
I'm sorry.

00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:02.990
I just thought maybe we would take a few minutes,

00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:05.830
but we can schedule a better time for this,

00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:08.990
and that way we can all get home earlier.

00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:11.429
No, Tom.

00:10:11.429 --> 00:10:13.870
It's me that needs to apologize.

00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:15.909
I overreacted.

00:10:15.909 --> 00:10:18.350
Look, you're right.

00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:21.070
Since all of us are here, it would be good for us

00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:23.190
to take care of this if we can.

00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:25.309
OK.

00:10:25.309 --> 00:10:26.909
Here comes Kevin.

00:10:26.909 --> 00:10:28.509
Let's see if he's available.

00:10:28.509 --> 00:10:30.110
OK.

00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:31.269
Hey, Cap.

00:10:31.269 --> 00:10:54.059
Good to see you.

00:10:54.059 --> 00:10:56.059
We had such a good time this morning.

00:10:56.059 --> 00:10:57.700
Always enjoy working with you in service.

00:10:57.700 --> 00:10:58.460
Same here.

00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:00.899
And I hope Miss Johnson comes to the meeting this Sunday.

00:11:00.899 --> 00:11:02.580
That would be so nice.

00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:04.259
Hey, did you ever find your sunglasses?

00:11:04.259 --> 00:11:05.940
No, I looked all over.

00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:08.019
I have no idea where they could be.

00:11:08.019 --> 00:11:09.980
Hey, Susan.

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:10.820
Good to see you.

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:11.500
Good to see you.

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:13.580
You left things at my house last night.

00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:15.299
Can you believe it?

00:11:15.299 --> 00:11:16.379
What?

00:11:16.379 --> 00:11:19.740
Susan had another gathering at her home last night.

00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:23.259
And I wasn't invited again.

00:11:23.259 --> 00:11:24.299
I just don't get it.

00:11:24.299 --> 00:11:25.379
I really had to be yours.

00:11:25.379 --> 00:11:26.340
Thanks again.

00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:28.820
I'm always living my stuff behind.

00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:30.580
And Helen, how are you doing?

00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:31.179
I'm fine.

00:11:31.179 --> 00:11:31.779
Sorry.

00:11:31.779 --> 00:11:32.820
I got it.

00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:34.580
Helen?

00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:35.580
What just happened?

00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:48.980
I have no idea.

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:52.539
Hey, Helen, got a second.

00:11:52.539 --> 00:11:54.740
What do you want, Susan?

00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:57.460
Helen, I feel like I must have done something

00:11:57.460 --> 00:11:58.460
or hurt you.

00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:01.259
And I want to apologize if I have.

00:12:01.259 --> 00:12:03.500
Is there something wrong?

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:06.899
I guess you had some more of the friends over last night?

00:12:06.899 --> 00:12:09.899
Well, yes, a few.

00:12:09.899 --> 00:12:15.340
Do you mind telling me why I'm never invited?

00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:16.620
Helen, I'm sorry.

00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:17.740
I never thought.

00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:19.500
Never thought what?

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:23.659
That I would have noticed how many times you've done this to me.

00:12:23.659 --> 00:12:27.019
Well, I've noticed yesterday makes the third time

00:12:27.059 --> 00:12:28.779
in the last couple of months.

00:12:28.779 --> 00:12:31.700
You've had people to your home without me.

00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:35.340
Not to mention the four other times earlier this year.

00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:37.340
I'm so sorry, Helen.

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:39.820
I didn't mean to cite you in any way.

00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:42.500
And I promise it was nothing personal.

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:44.379
Nothing personal.

00:12:44.379 --> 00:12:46.700
How can you invite everybody in the congregation

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:50.659
over to your home for a good time, except to me,

00:12:50.659 --> 00:12:56.539
and say that it's nothing personal?

00:12:56.539 --> 00:12:58.620
Good evening, brothers and sisters.

00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:00.539
We invite you to please find your seats

00:13:00.539 --> 00:13:22.000
for our meetings about to begin.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
We had such a good time this morning.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.679
Always enjoy working with you in service.

00:13:25.679 --> 00:13:26.600
Same here.

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:29.000
And I hope Ms. Johnson comes to the meeting this Sunday.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.639
That would be so nice.

00:13:30.639 --> 00:13:32.399
Hey, did you ever find your sunglasses?

00:13:32.399 --> 00:13:34.080
No, I looked all over.

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:36.200
I have no idea what it could be.

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:38.159
Hey, hey, Susan.

00:13:38.159 --> 00:13:38.960
Good to see you.

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:39.759
Good to see you.

00:13:39.759 --> 00:13:43.720
You left things at my house last night.

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:44.879
I should have known.

00:13:44.879 --> 00:13:45.919
Thank you so much, Susan.

00:13:45.919 --> 00:13:47.120
Where were they?

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:48.320
Wow.

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:51.720
Susan had another gathering at her home.

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:54.919
I wonder why I wasn't invited again.

00:13:54.919 --> 00:13:57.279
Wait, that's not important.

00:13:57.279 --> 00:13:59.600
She's so hospitable.

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:01.639
I'm going to pray that Jehovah continues

00:14:01.639 --> 00:14:03.600
to bless her for it.

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:06.480
And maybe there's something I can do.

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:07.639
And how are you doing?

00:14:07.639 --> 00:14:08.240
Fine.

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:09.519
How are you, Susan?

00:14:09.519 --> 00:14:10.519
Great.

00:14:10.519 --> 00:14:13.200
Hey, would you end you two now, Alice?

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:15.720
Would you like to work together in service this Saturday

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:17.360
and then come to my house for lunch?

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:18.919
That sounds so nice.

00:14:18.919 --> 00:14:21.679
What I'd like to, I would love to.

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:22.879
Thank you, Helen.

00:14:22.879 --> 00:14:24.200
What can I bring?

00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:25.480
Both of you, just bring yourselves.

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:26.879
I'll have everything ready.

00:14:26.879 --> 00:14:38.299
Oh, it sounds good.

00:14:38.299 --> 00:14:39.220
Hi, Debbie.

00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:42.100
I've got to tell you what I just heard yesterday.

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:44.340
Well, remember Bethany, who used to attend

00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:45.820
some of our meetings years ago?

00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:46.500
Yes.

00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:48.580
Is she starting going back to the meetings again?

00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:50.179
Not at all.

00:14:50.179 --> 00:14:52.980
She left the man that she's living with

00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:54.340
to move in with another.

00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:57.340
Wait, you've been keeping in touch with her?

00:14:57.340 --> 00:14:58.419
Well, no.

00:14:58.419 --> 00:15:01.340
I haven't talked her directly.

00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:03.899
They know where it gets around.

00:15:03.899 --> 00:15:05.700
Anyway, can you believe it?

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:09.659
Debbie, we both know Bethany has done a lot of bad things

00:15:09.659 --> 00:15:11.779
since she stopped attending the meetings.

00:15:11.779 --> 00:15:15.460
And I really hope she makes changes and comes back.

00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:18.620
But in the meantime, do you really think we should be

00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:21.379
spending our time talking about all the bad things

00:15:21.379 --> 00:15:23.740
she's doing right now?

00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:26.860
Well, probably not.

00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:30.899
I just figured, since we all grew up together,

00:15:30.899 --> 00:15:34.299
you want to know how far from the truth she's gotten.

00:15:34.299 --> 00:15:39.299
But, Debbie, love does not rejoice over unrighteousness,

00:15:39.299 --> 00:15:47.860
but rejoices with the truth.

00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:48.980
You know what?

00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:49.820
You're right.

00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:50.779
Why talk about this?

00:15:50.779 --> 00:15:52.779
We have so many good things to talk about.

00:15:52.779 --> 00:15:53.980
Yes, we do.

00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:55.220
Like this morning.

00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:57.179
Do you remember that call we went on last week?

00:15:57.179 --> 00:15:59.539
Well, Helen and I went back again this morning

00:15:59.539 --> 00:16:01.220
and the lady was home.

00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:03.620
She invited us in and we placed a book.

00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:04.379
Really?

00:16:04.379 --> 00:16:05.059
Yes.

00:16:05.059 --> 00:16:06.940
We even got to show her one of our videos

00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:09.500
and she says she may come to the meeting this Sunday.

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:24.629
That's wonderful, I hope.

00:16:24.629 --> 00:16:26.750
Wow, for the green.

00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:29.750
I didn't know it was that bad.

00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:33.389
The storm was far worse than expected.

00:16:33.389 --> 00:16:37.669
I had already followed the order to evacuate the city.

00:16:37.669 --> 00:16:41.389
I had no idea I'd never seen my home again.

00:16:41.389 --> 00:16:46.149
My wife had passed away a few years before the disaster.

00:16:46.149 --> 00:16:49.870
And I didn't have any family to stay with.

00:16:49.870 --> 00:16:54.710
So I really didn't have anything to go back to.

00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:57.990
So what did you do next?

00:16:57.990 --> 00:17:00.679
Next.

00:17:00.679 --> 00:18:59.130
Next, I learned what real love is all about.

00:18:59.130 --> 00:19:01.410
They took all of you into their home?

00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:02.930
Yes.

00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:05.049
Six of us.

00:19:05.049 --> 00:19:09.650
It wasn't easy sometimes for any of us,

00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:17.630
but in the end, we knew we could get through anything together

00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:48.180
because love endures all things.

00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:50.180
Hey, John, nice to see you again.

00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:51.299
Hey, if you don't have a seat already,

00:19:51.299 --> 00:19:53.140
we'd love to have you join us.

00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:54.180
Thanks.

00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:56.700
This is what your fourth time here?

00:19:56.700 --> 00:20:00.380
Yeah, yeah, I've just never seen anything like this before.

00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:01.779
Like what?

00:20:01.779 --> 00:20:03.420
Hello, John.

00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:07.500
I just wanted to say hi and tell you how glad I am to see you here.

00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:09.180
Thank you, sir. Nice to see you, too.

00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:10.099
And Jimmy.

00:20:10.099 --> 00:20:11.380
Hi, brother Thompson.

00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:15.819
I want to thank you so much for that package you dropped off yesterday.

00:20:15.819 --> 00:20:18.740
Chloe and I really appreciate your thoughtfulness.

00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:21.420
Anytime, brother Thompson, anytime.

00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:22.019
Sorry.

00:20:22.019 --> 00:20:22.859
Don't mean it interrupt.

00:20:22.859 --> 00:20:25.220
Just want to come over and say hello to you, both.

00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:27.460
John, really nice to see you here.

00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:28.740
Please keep coming.

00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:29.859
Thanks, I will.

00:20:29.859 --> 00:20:32.980
And Jim, as always, good to see you.

00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:34.460
Same here, Gary.

00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:35.900
We're still in for tomorrow, right?

00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:37.579
Counting on it, six o'clock?

00:20:37.579 --> 00:20:38.299
That's right.

00:20:38.299 --> 00:20:38.980
Great.

00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:41.019
I'll see you then.

00:20:41.019 --> 00:20:42.819
No, where were we?

00:20:42.819 --> 00:20:45.579
Well, I was about to say how friendly everyone is here.

00:20:45.579 --> 00:20:47.779
And not just with me, I mean, with each other.

00:20:47.779 --> 00:20:50.019
You people really practice what you preach.

00:20:50.019 --> 00:20:51.420
Well, thanks, John.

00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:54.140
You know, Jesus said for us to have love among ourselves.

00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:57.259
And we really try our best to follow that command.

00:20:57.259 --> 00:20:59.579
Of course, if you keep coming, you're

00:20:59.579 --> 00:21:00.980
going to see we're not perfect.

00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:02.539
Well, I think I've seen enough to know

00:21:02.539 --> 00:21:05.220
that I'm ready for that Bible study you've been offering me.

00:21:05.259 --> 00:21:06.500
Oh, that's great, John.

00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:07.980
Good evening, brothers and sisters.

00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:09.259
You know, let's take our seats.

00:21:09.259 --> 00:21:10.700
And we'll talk more about the Bible study

00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:11.619
after the meeting.

00:21:11.619 --> 00:21:12.619
OK.
