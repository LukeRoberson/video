00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.300
Jehovah is great and most worthy of...

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:09.599
Praise.

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.300
Very good.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:16.100
Worthy of praise in the city of Argaad in his holy mountain.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.300
Beautiful in its loftiness, the joy of the whole earth.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.800
His mount.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.000
Who can tell me?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.199
Mount Zion.

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:29.699
Both of you have been paying good attention.

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.200
Now, where is Mount Zion?

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.600
Right here, father.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.700
Right here.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.500
Where?

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.500
I don't see it.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.500
Are you sure?

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.700
No, but I already live on Mount Zion.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.299
Are you saying we live on a mountain?

00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:48.740
Yes.

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.340
What is so special about Mount Zion?

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:52.140
I know.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.640
Tell me my dear.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.840
This is where King David lived.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.240
Jehovah said,

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:01.439
I have put my king upon Zion, my holy mountain.

00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:05.379
The priest brought the ark here.

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.180
I'm old, where do we get such studious children?

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:15.090
Just like their father.

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:41.620
Come on, children.

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:43.719
Zephaniah.

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:47.219
Today, my little son found this in a field.

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:52.920
I brought it home.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.459
They're filling the holy city with their filthy idols.

00:01:58.459 --> 00:02:01.760
Everywhere I look, I see pale images.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.040
Smoke on the high places.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.439
The smell of their incense makes me sick.

00:02:10.439 --> 00:02:13.439
I've been king for 12 years now.

00:02:13.439 --> 00:02:15.939
It's time to act.

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:21.129
I want to finish the cleansing work my grandfather started.

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:23.830
You will need Jehovah's help.

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.729
I know.

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:28.129
I've been praying about it day and night.

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:31.110
Good.

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.800
I will issue a proclamation.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:41.819
Let the word go forth that we will rid this land of idolatry.

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:45.780
I've seen this cheaper.

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.379
Take it or leave it.

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:57.310
We keep raising your prices.

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:18.159
We start here.

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:36.629
We will do to every false god in the land.

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:38.930
Father, wake up.

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:39.530
Father, come on.

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.530
This is no time to be sleeping.

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.129
Josiah is on a campaign against all other gods except Jehovah.

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:52.710
Josiah is upending his own kingdom.

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:58.680
Don't let go down as easily as they think.

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:05.020
Does he think people will kill their customs, their rituals?

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:11.849
No way of life.

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:13.750
He's a fool.

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:20.009
They'll rescue us.

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:24.490
They'll rescue us.

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:27.790
Father, look around.

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:31.990
All over Dune Andrew's home, Josiah is destroying bail images.

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.290
They can't even rescue themselves.

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:37.790
And the people, the people are supporting him.

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:45.100
Go ahead and doubt your disrespectful child.

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:48.399
You have become disloyal to bail.

00:04:48.399 --> 00:04:59.209
And to me, your father who gave you life will come up with a poem.

00:04:59.209 --> 00:05:50.339
With your pleas.

00:05:50.339 --> 00:05:59.420
A lover to please.

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:01.670
What do you want?

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:04.240
Please.

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:07.040
Tell the king the stalker that's doing.

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:08.240
This is madness.

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:20.350
He's endangering himself, his family, and our entire nation.

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:25.449
Josiah's campaign against bail worshipers.

00:06:25.449 --> 00:06:27.750
His campaign against bail himself.

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:30.149
I'll be mad at you, you disgusting idols.

00:06:30.149 --> 00:06:32.550
Get away from your father, guards rest you.

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:33.449
Forgive me.

00:06:33.449 --> 00:06:34.550
I beg you.

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:36.649
Just another word.

00:06:36.649 --> 00:06:43.579
Please.

00:06:43.579 --> 00:06:49.579
Pamoodle, I'm only telling you this for your own safety.

00:06:49.579 --> 00:06:55.629
It'd be terrible if something were to happen to the king.

00:06:55.629 --> 00:07:02.980
What happened to this father?

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:16.430
I think of your children.

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:23.680
The bail worshipers are no match for Jehovah, Pamoodle.

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:26.959
Please don't be fearful.

00:07:26.959 --> 00:07:29.860
But this campaign has gone on for a year.

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:32.959
How long do we have to endure this?

00:07:32.959 --> 00:07:37.879
However long it takes.

00:07:37.879 --> 00:07:39.980
Yes, my lord.

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:41.779
Zephaniah, the prophet has arrived.

00:07:41.779 --> 00:07:43.180
He brought someone with him.

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:44.279
Thank you.

00:07:44.279 --> 00:07:52.899
I'll see them in the throne room.

00:07:52.899 --> 00:07:55.600
Better check on the children.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:08:21.629
Please don't show your concern.

00:08:21.629 --> 00:08:27.740
I have I gone too far.

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:30.639
My own grandfather didn't succeed in.

00:08:30.639 --> 00:08:35.649
Riding the land of the high places.

00:08:35.649 --> 00:08:53.200
How can I do this?

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.600
This is Jeremiah from Adithov.

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:58.100
The man whom Jehovah has called to be a prophet.

00:08:58.100 --> 00:08:58.899
Welcome.

00:08:58.899 --> 00:09:00.799
King Josiah, all the faithful ones

00:09:00.799 --> 00:09:03.399
support your campaign against idolatry.

00:09:03.399 --> 00:09:05.399
We have done as you direct them, my lord.

00:09:05.399 --> 00:09:08.000
And since you began this campaign 18 months ago,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000
you have gained many supporters.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.399
This is true yet.

00:09:15.399 --> 00:09:19.799
Many have continued worshiping bail, men like Ben Matten.

00:09:19.799 --> 00:09:23.049
Pose a great threat.

00:09:23.049 --> 00:09:25.149
The people may even resort to violence

00:09:25.149 --> 00:09:29.519
to oppose this great work.

00:09:29.519 --> 00:09:33.379
No doubt.

00:09:33.379 --> 00:09:37.289
My lord, do you feel that you may not

00:09:37.289 --> 00:09:43.559
have what it takes to complete such a task?

00:09:43.559 --> 00:09:50.860
Your storing pure worship will take much more effort.

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:53.360
But it's the right thing to do.

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:55.559
You're right, Josiah.

00:09:55.559 --> 00:09:58.460
But you're not doing this in human strength.

00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:01.159
Jehovah is on your side.

00:10:01.159 --> 00:10:03.759
You will give you the courage, wisdom, and strength

00:10:03.759 --> 00:10:06.159
to complete this work.

00:10:06.159 --> 00:10:10.759
When I expressed doubt in my own abilities,

00:10:10.759 --> 00:10:15.259
Jehovah told me, do not say I am just a boy.

00:10:15.259 --> 00:10:18.659
But Jehovah spoke to you directly, Jeremiah.

00:10:18.659 --> 00:10:22.059
How can I be sure that will back me up that way?

00:10:22.059 --> 00:10:24.759
Jeremiah just told me of a prophecy,

00:10:24.759 --> 00:10:28.360
given hundreds of years ago, after King Jeroboam

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:31.159
set up his own altar in the northern kingdom.

00:10:31.159 --> 00:10:35.860
By the word of Jehovah, man of God came from Judah to Bethel

00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:38.159
while Jeroboam was standing by the altar

00:10:38.159 --> 00:10:40.460
to make sacrificial smoke.

00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:43.159
Then, he called out against the altar

00:10:43.159 --> 00:10:46.759
by the word of Jehovah and said,

00:10:46.759 --> 00:10:49.460
Oh, altar, altar.

00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:51.960
This is what Jehovah says.

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:58.059
Look, a son named Josiah will be born to the house of David.

00:10:58.059 --> 00:11:02.759
And he will sacrifice on you the priests of the high places,

00:11:02.759 --> 00:11:06.659
those making sacrificial smoke on you.

00:11:06.659 --> 00:11:11.480
And he will burn human bones on you.

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:15.580
So do not waver in a lack of faith, Josiah.

00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:21.980
Become powerful by faith, like our Father Abraham.

00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:25.179
Jehovah also spoke to me, Josiah.

00:11:25.179 --> 00:11:30.980
He said, I will wipe out from this place every vestige of bail,

00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:35.779
the name of the foreign God priests, along with the priests.

00:11:35.779 --> 00:11:40.379
I will call to account the princes, the sons of the King,

00:11:40.379 --> 00:11:43.279
and all those wearing foreign clothing.

00:11:43.379 --> 00:11:47.179
Neither their silver nor their gold will save them.

00:11:47.179 --> 00:12:19.850
He will bring to nothing all the gods of the earth.

00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:24.120
Shafen the cleansing campaign has gone well,

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:27.320
but the temple is in disrepair.

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:30.019
It has been neglected for decades.

00:12:30.019 --> 00:12:32.720
I hardly agree, my Lord.

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:35.519
Go up to Hilkai of the high priest.

00:12:35.519 --> 00:12:40.320
Let him collect all the silver that is brought into the house of Jehovah.

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:44.320
Give it to those appointed over the work to repair the damage.

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:47.519
Tell them to buy timbers and hune stones.

00:12:47.519 --> 00:12:48.919
Very good, my Lord.

00:12:48.919 --> 00:12:51.220
And who should keep account of the funds?

00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:52.519
Shafen?

00:12:52.519 --> 00:12:54.120
No, Joah.

00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:56.720
No accounting should be required for the silver.

00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:58.820
All of these men are trustworthy.

00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:04.409
Yes, my Lord, as you wish.

00:13:04.409 --> 00:13:10.610
The day my grandfather died, he spoke of the temple.

00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:15.259
I kept this safe all these years.

00:13:15.259 --> 00:13:28.039
Hoping one day I could glorify Joah's house.

00:13:28.039 --> 00:15:36.460
Today is that day.

00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:37.360
Hilkai!

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:38.559
What's wrong?

00:15:38.559 --> 00:15:44.860
Shafen, I found the book of the law in the house of Jehovah.

00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:46.360
The book of the law?

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:53.070
I've never seen these passages before.

00:15:53.070 --> 00:16:12.210
Take this rose of King Josiah immediately.

00:16:12.210 --> 00:16:14.950
My Lord.

00:16:14.950 --> 00:16:17.950
Shafen, how's the renovation coming?

00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:21.149
Your servants are doing everything that was assigned to them.

00:16:21.149 --> 00:16:24.649
They have poured out the money that was found in the house of Jehovah

00:16:24.649 --> 00:16:26.850
and they have handed it over to the appointed men

00:16:26.850 --> 00:16:28.450
and to those doing the work.

00:16:28.450 --> 00:16:33.649
Very well.

00:16:33.649 --> 00:16:35.350
Is there something else?

00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:37.450
Yes, my Lord.

00:16:37.450 --> 00:16:41.850
There is a book that Hilkai of the priest has given me.

00:16:41.850 --> 00:16:44.720
What book?

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:49.769
They appear to be the words of Moses, my Lord.

00:16:49.769 --> 00:16:53.610
Read it to us then.

00:16:53.610 --> 00:16:57.110
These are the regulations and the judicial decisions

00:16:57.110 --> 00:17:01.509
that you should be careful to carry out.

00:17:01.509 --> 00:17:04.609
You should completely destroy all the places

00:17:04.609 --> 00:17:09.710
where the nations you will dispossess have served their gods.

00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:13.509
Whether on the high mountains or on the hills

00:17:13.509 --> 00:17:17.109
or under any luxury and tree.

00:17:17.109 --> 00:17:22.410
You should pull down their alters, shatter their sacred pillars,

00:17:22.410 --> 00:17:24.710
burn their sacred poles in the fire,

00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:27.910
and cut down the graven images of their gods

00:17:27.910 --> 00:17:54.220
obliterating their very names from that place.

00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:56.420
All of you, along with Hilkai,

00:17:56.420 --> 00:18:00.119
inquire of Jehovah concerning the words of the book that has been found.

00:18:00.119 --> 00:18:02.019
For Jehovah's Raid is great

00:18:02.019 --> 00:18:05.720
because our forefathers did not carry out the word of Jehovah

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:24.380
by observing all that is written in this book.

00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:27.880
The prophet is holed to lives nearby in the second quarter.

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:59.430
I'll ask Hilkai to meet us there.

00:18:59.529 --> 00:19:04.329
This is what Jehovah, the God of Israel, says.

00:19:04.329 --> 00:19:07.930
Tell a man who sent you to me.

00:19:07.930 --> 00:19:13.029
I will bring calamity on this place and its inhabitants.

00:19:13.029 --> 00:19:15.230
All the curses that are written in the book

00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:18.230
that they read before the King of Judah.

00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:20.730
Because they have abandoned me

00:19:20.730 --> 00:19:24.230
and they're making sacrifices smoked to other gods

00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:28.289
in order to offend me,

00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:31.390
my rage will pour out on this place

00:19:31.390 --> 00:19:37.759
and it will not be extinguished

00:19:37.759 --> 00:19:40.359
but to the King of Judah.

00:19:40.359 --> 00:19:44.460
This is what Jehovah, the God of Israel, says.

00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:48.259
Because your heart was responsive

00:19:48.259 --> 00:19:50.359
and you humbled yourself before God

00:19:50.359 --> 00:19:52.660
on hearing his words

00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:55.460
and ripped your garments apart

00:19:55.460 --> 00:20:00.460
and wept before me.

00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:03.660
I also have heard you.

00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:07.259
That is why you will be laden your grave in peace

00:20:07.259 --> 00:20:10.059
and your eyes will not see all the calamity

00:20:10.059 --> 00:20:16.039
that I will bring on this place.

00:20:16.039 --> 00:20:20.670
Praise be Jehovah our merciful God.

00:20:20.670 --> 00:20:25.200
We're holding back his wrath.

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:28.200
Summon all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:30.400
Have them come up to the house of Jehovah.

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:37.779
Careful to obey all these words that I'm commanding you

00:20:37.779 --> 00:20:40.579
so that it may always go well with you

00:20:40.579 --> 00:20:42.980
and your sons after you

00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:45.680
because you are doing what is good and right

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:48.480
and the eyes of Jehovah your God.

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:50.980
When Jehovah your God annihilates the nations

00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:53.279
that you are to dispossess,

00:20:53.279 --> 00:20:56.579
do not ask about their gods saying,

00:20:56.579 --> 00:21:00.380
how are these nations accustomed to serve their gods?

00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:03.579
Because they do for their gods every detestable thing

00:21:03.579 --> 00:21:06.480
that Jehovah hates.

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:10.579
Even burning their sons and their daughters

00:21:10.579 --> 00:21:14.839
in the fire to their gods.

00:21:14.839 --> 00:21:22.140
If your brother or your son or your daughter

00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:27.539
or your cherished wife or closest companion

00:21:27.539 --> 00:21:31.140
should try to entice you in secrecy

00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:35.940
saying, let us go and serve other gods.

00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:40.039
You must not give in to him or listen to him

00:21:40.039 --> 00:21:43.640
nor should you show pity or feel compassion

00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:46.140
or protect him.

00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:56.359
Instead, you should kill him without fail.

00:21:56.359 --> 00:21:59.759
Observe the month of Abib and celebrate the Passover

00:21:59.759 --> 00:22:02.059
to Jehovah your God.

00:22:02.059 --> 00:22:04.160
For in the month of Abib, Jehovah your God

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:07.759
brought you out of Egypt by night.

00:22:07.759 --> 00:22:10.460
And you should sacrifice the Passover offering

00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:14.559
to Jehovah your God in the place that Jehovah chooses

00:22:14.559 --> 00:22:18.339
to have his name reside.

00:22:18.339 --> 00:22:20.440
Please join me in making a covenant

00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:23.240
with the one true God, Jehovah,

00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:29.680
to carry out all the words of this book.

00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:32.180
Jehovah our God in the heavens.

00:22:32.180 --> 00:23:03.319
Down to the Kidron Valley and burn them there.

00:23:03.319 --> 00:23:07.319
And desecrate Toveth so that no one can make

00:23:07.319 --> 00:23:13.609
their son or their daughter pass to the fire there.

00:23:13.609 --> 00:23:18.569
This is only the beginning.

00:23:18.569 --> 00:23:20.369
When Jehovah's help, we will read the entire land

00:23:20.369 --> 00:23:25.589
of high places.

00:23:25.589 --> 00:23:28.589
Every vestige of false worship

00:23:28.589 --> 00:23:38.299
and every one who promotes it.

00:23:38.299 --> 00:23:40.799
Once we cleanse the land of Judah,

00:23:40.799 --> 00:25:29.029
we'll head north again to the cities of Samaria.

00:25:29.029 --> 00:25:31.329
To whom these graves belong?

00:25:31.329 --> 00:25:36.210
They belong to the bail prophets.

00:25:36.210 --> 00:25:38.009
Take their bones and burn them on the altar

00:25:38.009 --> 00:25:40.210
of Keith Jeroboam.

00:25:40.210 --> 00:26:00.470
Afterwards, tear it down.

00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:02.670
What is the grave over there?

00:26:02.670 --> 00:26:05.369
It is the grave of the man of the true God.

00:26:05.369 --> 00:26:06.869
Who foretold these things that you've done

00:26:06.869 --> 00:26:16.849
against the altar of Bethel?

00:26:16.849 --> 00:26:18.450
Let him rest.

00:26:18.450 --> 00:26:20.750
Do not let anyone disturb his bones.

00:26:20.750 --> 00:27:06.990
You know this grandfather.

00:27:06.990 --> 00:27:09.390
And now he's turned my own son against me.

00:27:09.390 --> 00:27:10.890
That is not true.

00:27:10.890 --> 00:27:16.799
This is about standing up for what is right.

00:27:16.799 --> 00:27:18.900
Bill is powerless.

00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:22.440
What can't you see that?

00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:23.539
powerless.

00:27:23.539 --> 00:27:30.500
I...

00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:32.299
wish...

00:27:32.299 --> 00:27:43.309
I had sacrificed you until death.

00:27:43.309 --> 00:27:45.210
No one.

00:27:45.210 --> 00:27:46.609
Whatever.

00:27:46.609 --> 00:27:51.190
Be a way to do that again.

00:27:51.190 --> 00:28:42.619
Just so I made sure of that.

00:28:42.619 --> 00:28:46.119
Everything has finally been accomplished according to the law.

00:28:46.119 --> 00:28:51.950
There is one thing left for us to make right.

00:28:51.950 --> 00:28:55.150
Command the people to hold a Passover to Jehovah

00:28:55.150 --> 00:28:57.750
as is written in the book of the Covenant.

00:28:57.750 --> 00:29:01.750
What if the people can't afford the Passover sacrifices?

00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:05.549
I will contribute cattle to the people and my own flocks.

00:29:05.650 --> 00:29:07.650
With great pleasure.

00:29:07.650 --> 00:29:11.049
The Passover has not been held in grand style

00:29:11.049 --> 00:29:13.250
since the days of the judges.

00:29:13.250 --> 00:30:22.789
Careful to obey all these words that I am commanding you

00:30:22.789 --> 00:30:25.690
so that it may always go well with you

00:30:25.690 --> 00:30:27.789
and your sons after you

00:30:27.789 --> 00:30:39.710
as you are doing what is good

00:30:39.710 --> 00:30:43.410
and right in the eyes of Jehovah your God.
