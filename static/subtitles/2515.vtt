00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:08.269
Caleb Sophia, I have presents for you.

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:09.269
Presents?

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.269
Oh, presents.

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:13.269
Also, my new car.

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:14.269
Oh, paintbrushes.

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:15.269
Thank you, Mommy.

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.269
Thank you, Mommy.

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:20.269
These are mine.

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:42.109
Back, it's my turn.

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:43.109
Caleb, let me see.

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:44.109
No, come on.

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:45.109
Give it back.

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:46.109
Stop.

00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:47.109
Okay, kids.

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:49.109
Looks like we need a lesson on sharing.

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:51.109
Whoa!

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:54.109
When Jehovah created the paradise.

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:58.109
Do you think he kept all of the animals to himself?

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.810
No.

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:03.810
He shared all his animals.

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:05.810
Even the cute little ones.

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:06.810
That's right.

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.810
Jehovah shares everything with us.

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:16.969
So what do you think you should do?

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:35.239
Do you want to try?

00:01:35.239 --> 00:01:39.670
Do you want to go first?

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:40.670
Really?

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.780
Yeah.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:45.780
Ready?

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:47.780
Set.

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:49.780
Go!
