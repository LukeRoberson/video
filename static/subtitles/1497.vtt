00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:08.179
In Berlin, Professor Roland Hetzer at the German Heart Institute

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:12.380
corrects a ventricular septal defect in a ten-month-old girl.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:20.260
In Yena, Professor Johannes Schela at Friedrich Schiller University Clinic

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.260
performs a liver resection.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.260
In London, Peter Earnshaw, a fellow of the Royal College

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.259
who practices at guys in St. Thomas hospitals,

00:00:33.259 --> 00:00:36.259
performs a total knee replacement.

00:00:36.259 --> 00:00:40.259
Challenging surgeries, but they share an added dimension.

00:00:40.259 --> 00:00:43.259
In each of these cases, the team had committed itself

00:00:43.259 --> 00:00:46.259
to operating without allogeneic blood transfusion.

00:00:46.259 --> 00:00:51.259
Today in 150 countries, more than 100,000 physicians

00:00:51.259 --> 00:00:55.259
have made a similar commitment to bloodless medicine and surgery

00:00:55.259 --> 00:00:59.259
because they believe transfusion alternative strategies

00:00:59.259 --> 00:01:03.259
are simple, safe, effective.

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:08.569
Many view the pioneering bloodless major cardiovascular

00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:13.569
surgery of Dr. Denton Cooley in the 1950s as the beginning.

00:01:13.569 --> 00:01:16.569
He cooperated with patients who are Jehovah's Witnesses

00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:19.569
and who, while seeking quality medical and surgical treatment,

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:22.569
do not accept allogeneic blood transfusion,

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:27.569
they observe the biblical injunction abstain from blood.

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:32.569
In 1977, Cooley's team published a report on their 20 years of experience

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:37.569
with a consecutive series of 542 bloodless cardiovascular surgeries.

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:41.569
The report noted an acceptably low risk.

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:45.569
Professor Richard Spence, a pioneer in transfusion alternative strategies.

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:48.569
The lessons we learned in the early stages of bloodless medicine

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:51.569
and surgery with the Jehovah's Witness clearly translated

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:54.569
over all of the rest of our patients.

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:57.569
So the field now really of blood conservation

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:00.569
includes the use of multiple alternatives

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:05.569
and a planned way to avoid the need to transfuse a patient

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:09.460
with someone else's blood.

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:13.460
We have operated on newborns, we have operated on people in their 90s,

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:17.460
and we use these same techniques and approaches.

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:22.460
Professor Albert Hu, speaking of efforts in the general patient population.

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:30.460
In the era when the risks of blood transfusion were not realized as they are today,

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:37.460
15% of all women in such a group of at-risk patients received blood.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:41.460
Today, this figure is far below 1%,

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:45.460
even though we are a center for complicated cases.

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:50.460
We've now reduced our transfusion rate

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:55.460
for new replacements, new revision replacements.

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.460
I think of the order of 5 to 8%.

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:01.460
Ideally, we'd like to get it down to zero.

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:04.460
Professor Hetzer points to one reason for such efforts.

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:08.460
Today, at least 80% of the patients

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:13.460
would strongly favor not to have blood transfusions.

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:15.460
And for legal and ethical reasons,

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:18.460
today attention is increasingly being given

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:20.460
to inspecting the wishes of the patient.

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:24.460
Experts also cite their desire to avoid medical risks

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:27.460
related to transfusing allergenic blood.

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:29.460
Any unit that is donated into the blood bank,

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:32.460
whether it's an allergenic unit or a PAD unit,

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:35.460
there's always the risk of administrative error

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:40.460
and an ABO mismatch and a fatal hemolytic transfusion reaction.

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:45.460
Side effects include not only the transmission of viral diseases

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:50.460
that everybody talks about like HIV or hepatitis B or C,

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:55.460
but also new viruses that are prevalent in the donor population.

00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:00.460
Also, parasitic diseases are more and more transmitted

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:03.460
via blood transfusions.

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:06.460
The public health impact of transfusion in a modulation

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:08.460
is very difficult to estimate.

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:12.460
And we've estimated that approximately in the United States,

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:16.459
we can expect that 10 to 50,000 patients a year

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:21.459
may be dying from transfusion in a modulation related causes.

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:27.459
Will existing viruses mutate and produce disease?

00:04:27.459 --> 00:04:31.459
There's no reason to believe that they want.

00:04:31.459 --> 00:04:34.459
Many see these risks and the resulting costs,

00:04:34.459 --> 00:04:38.459
but feel that they have no alternatives to allergenic blood.

00:04:38.459 --> 00:04:42.459
However, even the benefits of present policies on the use of allergenic blood

00:04:42.459 --> 00:04:46.459
come under question in view of a groundbreaking study

00:04:46.459 --> 00:04:48.459
by Dr. Paul A. Bear of Canada.

00:04:48.459 --> 00:04:52.459
It compared a liberal transfusion policy with a restrictive one

00:04:52.459 --> 00:04:55.459
in critically ill ICU patients.

00:04:55.459 --> 00:04:59.459
The results were surprising, particularly the mortality rates.

00:04:59.459 --> 00:05:02.459
I talk about the A. Bear paper

00:05:02.459 --> 00:05:04.459
where they showed it more than 800 patients

00:05:04.459 --> 00:05:08.459
that less transfusion results in an improved outcome.

00:05:08.459 --> 00:05:12.459
Other evidence showing the need to review policies on the use of blood

00:05:12.459 --> 00:05:14.459
comes from two earlier studies.

00:05:14.459 --> 00:05:18.459
Consider first the Sanguis study published in 1994.

00:05:18.459 --> 00:05:21.459
Part of a concerted action of the European Commission's

00:05:21.459 --> 00:05:25.459
Medical Research Program, the study analyzed transfusion rates

00:05:25.459 --> 00:05:28.459
in major health care centers across Europe.

00:05:28.459 --> 00:05:31.459
Forty-three teaching hospitals were prospectively studied

00:05:31.459 --> 00:05:34.459
as to their routine transfusion rates

00:05:34.459 --> 00:05:37.459
for six common standardized operations.

00:05:37.459 --> 00:05:40.459
The Sanguis study revealed that different institutions routinely

00:05:40.459 --> 00:05:43.459
transfused drastically different percentages of patients

00:05:43.459 --> 00:05:48.459
for the same surgeries, varying from 0% at some institutions

00:05:48.459 --> 00:05:52.459
to 96% at others on coronary artery bypass graft

00:05:52.459 --> 00:05:57.459
and from 0% to 100% on total hip replacement.

00:05:57.459 --> 00:06:03.459
The main lesson is the variability of a transfusion practice

00:06:03.459 --> 00:06:11.459
from one center to another for the same specific operation.

00:06:11.459 --> 00:06:15.459
In 1998, in Belgium, a follow-up study was published.

00:06:15.459 --> 00:06:20.459
So all types of hospitals were included in the Belgium Biomed Transfusion study

00:06:20.459 --> 00:06:22.459
for surgery.

00:06:22.459 --> 00:06:27.459
And we found exactly the same range of variability.

00:06:27.459 --> 00:06:32.459
So we are left with the conclusion that variability implies

00:06:32.459 --> 00:06:35.459
that a lot of these blood transfusion components

00:06:35.459 --> 00:06:37.459
are being given unnecessarily.

00:06:37.459 --> 00:06:41.459
However, there is a positive note regarding two Belgian hospitals

00:06:41.459 --> 00:06:44.459
that participated in both studies.

00:06:44.459 --> 00:06:48.459
After the Sanguis study, they changed their transfusion policy.

00:06:48.459 --> 00:06:53.459
They had somehow managed to reduce their blood consumption

00:06:53.459 --> 00:06:57.459
for major surgery, like collectomephal cancer,

00:06:57.459 --> 00:07:00.459
by a factor of five, at least.

00:07:00.459 --> 00:07:05.459
The hospitals they was shorter, so we have no evidence

00:07:05.459 --> 00:07:09.459
of increased morbidity, nor mortality.

00:07:09.459 --> 00:07:12.459
In the light of what has been learned in the last few years,

00:07:12.459 --> 00:07:17.459
Professor Philippe Funder-Linden summarizes what many experts have concluded.

00:07:17.459 --> 00:07:22.459
In view of the potential for a better patient care

00:07:22.459 --> 00:07:29.459
and reduced ill-care cost, blood conservation is not an option.

00:07:29.459 --> 00:07:31.459
It's a must.

00:07:31.459 --> 00:07:36.459
But what is the foundation for an effective transfusion alternative program?

00:07:36.459 --> 00:07:39.459
Experts agree that it is a team approach.

00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:46.459
It truly has to be a cooperative effort, a team effort to the approach.

00:07:46.459 --> 00:07:50.459
And it has to be tailored to the patient's condition,

00:07:50.459 --> 00:07:53.459
as well as the operative procedures.

00:07:53.459 --> 00:07:57.459
Some techniques are appropriate for some procedures and some surgeons,

00:07:57.459 --> 00:08:00.459
and not for others.

00:08:00.459 --> 00:08:04.459
The various transfusion alternative techniques used by successful teams

00:08:04.459 --> 00:08:09.459
can be placed under three basic principles or pillars.

00:08:09.459 --> 00:08:15.459
Pre-operative planning involves to realize that a patient has not enough

00:08:15.459 --> 00:08:19.459
anogenous red blood cells for planned operation.

00:08:19.459 --> 00:08:24.459
And this depends not only on the hematocrit,

00:08:24.459 --> 00:08:28.459
but also on the estimated blood volume of a given patient,

00:08:28.459 --> 00:08:33.460
the estimated blood loss that the planned operation is associated with,

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:40.460
and also the transfusion threshold that can be considered reasonable or tolerable

00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:42.460
in this individual patient.

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:46.460
The first pillar can be defined as appropriate tolerance of anemia.

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:52.990
This involves reconsidering the standard policy on anemia treatment.

00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:57.990
Some still use a transfusion trigger of a hematocrit of 30%,

00:08:57.990 --> 00:09:01.990
or a hemoglobin level of 10 grams per deciliter for all patients.

00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:07.990
Thresholds that date back to an article by Adams and Lundy published in 1942.

00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:14.990
I am really convinced that there is no place for the magic 10 grams.

00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:19.990
Our experience with Jehovah's Witness has shown that, first of all,

00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:25.990
we don't need the hemoglobin levels we assumed were essential previously.

00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:29.990
But there should be no harder fast rule or there should be no trigger.

00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:34.990
You can anesthetize patients with some procedures depending upon the patient.

00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:38.990
There's always two or three grams if necessary.

00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:43.990
All experienced physicians stress the importance of maintaining normal valemia

00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:46.990
via simple volume replacement.

00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:52.990
With adequate volume, oxygen consumption is maintained over a wide range of hemoglobin levels.

00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:57.990
According to Professor Fundalinden, the two main mechanisms responsible

00:09:57.990 --> 00:10:03.990
for the maintenance of adequate tissue oxygenation are an increase in cardiac output.

00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:07.990
And an increase in tissue oxygen extraction.

00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:12.990
In the range of hematocrit values illustrated, the amount of oxygen extracted

00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:17.990
from the red blood cells of a non-anemic person is practically the same as that

00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:22.990
taken up from fewer red blood cells under acute normal valemic anemia.

00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:29.990
The first mechanism results from the decreased blood viscosity and sympathetic stimulation.

00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:36.990
The second mechanism results from a redistribution of blood flow to areas of high metabolic demand

00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:42.460
and from improved micro-circulation.

00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:48.460
I am really convinced that a better knowledge of the mechanism

00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:54.460
allowing the maintenance of adequate tissue oxygenation

00:10:54.460 --> 00:11:01.460
during acute normal valemic anemia could decrease the risk of blood transfusion.

00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:05.460
What does experience with this principle alone reveal?

00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:08.460
I halved our transfusion rate by simply saying,

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:11.460
could we lower our triggers from 10 to 8?

00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:14.460
And just taking a little more control over the decision.

00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:17.460
That was very easy. That cost nothing.

00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:22.460
We do know that we can allow patients to collaborate

00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:27.460
to relatively low hemoglobin levels without blood transfusions.

00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:30.460
Obviously, it is important to plan ahead.

00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:35.460
Especially if the patient for religious or other reasons refuses allogeneic blood.

00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:40.460
Preoperative planning requires a careful clinical assessment of the bleeding risks

00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:45.460
and a thorough laboratory screening, including standard hematological parameters.

00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:49.460
Based on the patient's condition, this may include other tests,

00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:55.460
such as a coagulation profile and tests for conditions contributing to anemia.

00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:58.460
Next, there is the need to calculate the safety zone

00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:02.460
where tolerable red blood cell loss for a particular patient

00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:04.460
throughout perioperative care.

00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:11.460
Here is how Professor Ernst Shaw explains his approach using the example of joint replacement.

00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:17.460
All you need is height and weight, male or female, initially hemoglobin, hematocrit.

00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:21.460
And you can immediately work out what their blood volume is.

00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:24.460
Next, either using your personal data

00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:27.460
and anybody who's doing more than a few joint replacements

00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:31.460
should be able to go back and look what their typical loss is.

00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:35.460
So you want to know what loss there will be for that particular procedure.

00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:39.460
The only other thing you need to know is how much can you tolerate?

00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:42.460
In other words, how low can you let this patient go?

00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:47.460
What if the expected RBC loss is greater than the tolerable?

00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:52.460
You can increase the blood loss that is tolerated by the patient

00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:57.460
by simply lowering the threshold of transfusion trigger

00:12:57.460 --> 00:13:06.460
or you can increase the allowable blood loss by increasing the initial hematocrit of the patient

00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:14.460
and therefore have the patient start or go into the operation with a higher mass of red blood cells.

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:22.460
Several of these proactive techniques can be grouped under the second pillar, optimizing RBC mass.

00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:31.460
We can expand the circulating red blood cell mass of the patients before the operation.

00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:40.460
And this can be achieved with cheap hematinics like iron, polycacid, vitamin B12.

00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:48.460
For selected cases, recombinant erythropoietin or EPO combined with iron therapy can be used to treat anemia

00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:54.460
or to raise the pre-surgical hematocrit to within a range of 45 to 50%.

00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:59.460
EPO is normally started 10 to 21 days prior to surgery.

00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:09.830
EPO illustrated by small particles increases red cell production by affecting the survival, differentiation,

00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:19.139
and maturation of erythroid cells in the bone marrow.

00:14:19.139 --> 00:14:24.139
In the late erythroblastic stage, the nuclei are expelled.

00:14:24.139 --> 00:14:30.799
Finally, the erythrocytes are pushed into the bloodstream.

00:14:30.799 --> 00:14:38.100
Note the acceleration of red cell production with EPO.

00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:44.100
Besides the increase in RBC mass, under EPO treatment, usually one week is gained.

00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:53.710
Note the comparatively higher hematocrit rise under EPO therapy according to one study.

00:14:53.710 --> 00:15:07.090
And utilizing erythropoietin, we can increase the circulating hemoglobin by one bram decidator for each week of treatment.

00:15:07.090 --> 00:15:14.090
For commenting human erythropoietin therapy is a tool that has also been shown to be effective as a blood conservation strategy.

00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:20.090
It's been shown particularly in orthopedic procedures in patients who are anemic.

00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:27.090
And by that I mean whose initial hemoglobin is less than 13 or hematocrit is less than 39%.

00:15:27.090 --> 00:15:31.090
Now we use erythropoietin in very specific cases.

00:15:31.090 --> 00:15:40.090
Like for instance, also the children of Chihuahua's witnesses, where we start to administer this medication four to six weeks before the operation.

00:15:40.090 --> 00:15:45.090
It's given twice a week with a dosage of 400 units per kilogram.

00:15:45.090 --> 00:15:55.090
If you combine the two principles that is increasing the preoperative hematocrit and decreasing the threshold for allogeneic blood transfusion,

00:15:55.090 --> 00:16:02.090
then you can allow an even larger blood loss to occur without the need for allogeneic blood transfusion.

00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:10.090
Now this allowable blood loss can be further reduced certainly by surgical techniques or by anesthesiological techniques.

00:16:10.090 --> 00:16:24.090
Thus even such complex procedures as spinal surgery and redo open heart surgery are routinely performed with an even wider safety zone, afforded by the third pillar of a transfusion alternative protocol.

00:16:25.090 --> 00:16:31.090
Either by minimizing the bleeding or by recovering shed blood.

00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:36.090
Let's consider several important intraoperative techniques.

00:16:36.090 --> 00:16:41.090
Patient positioning is a simple cost-effective technique to reduce bleeding.

00:16:41.090 --> 00:16:51.090
Local venous pressure changes depending on the field's position relative to the heart and lower pressure directly correlates with blood saved.

00:16:52.090 --> 00:16:55.090
It's important to position the patient properly due to an orthopedic surgery.

00:16:55.090 --> 00:17:00.090
In my experience, it makes a big difference in spinal surgery.

00:17:00.090 --> 00:17:05.089
With pressure on the abdomen and thus on the paravertebral veins, blood loss increases.

00:17:05.089 --> 00:17:11.089
With proper support, avoiding abdominal compression, blood loss decreases.

00:17:11.089 --> 00:17:18.089
Another option to decrease venous pressure in some surgeries is to use regional instead of general anesthesia.

00:17:18.089 --> 00:17:27.089
As shown here, prior to a cesarean section, a further technique is the maintenance of normal thermia, especially during long operations.

00:17:27.089 --> 00:17:36.089
So if a patient is cool or cold by one or two degrees temperature, you are seeing a loss in ability of platelets and coagulation factors to work.

00:17:36.089 --> 00:17:39.089
So it's essential that we keep the patient's normal thermic.

00:17:39.089 --> 00:17:42.089
Normal thermia is extremely important.

00:17:42.089 --> 00:17:48.089
Therefore, our operating theatre temperatures are 27 degrees in those major procedures.

00:17:48.089 --> 00:17:54.089
Which sometimes is hard for the surgeons, even for the anesthesiologists, but it's very good for the patient.

00:17:54.089 --> 00:18:00.089
More directly, the patient's body can be warmed with a thermal suit or blankets.

00:18:00.089 --> 00:18:06.460
There are even simple machines to warm fluids before infusion.

00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:09.460
Next, hemodolution.

00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:16.460
The principles of hemodolution in terms of reduction of blood loss are really quite simple.

00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:28.460
If blood is removed from the patient immediately prior to or immediately after induction of anesthesia and replaced with a cellular fluids,

00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:34.460
then when the patient bleeds interoperatively, the red cell loss is less.

00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:42.460
For every 100 ml of whole blood lost by the patient, in the case of a patient with a hematocard of 27%,

00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:54.460
they're going to lose 27 ml of RBCs rather than the 45 ml of RBCs they would have lost had we started the case at a hematocard of 45%.

00:18:54.460 --> 00:19:00.460
Additionally, the hemodolution procedure is acceptable to a number of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:14.900
Hemodolution is certainly cost-effective, but not only that, it is also beneficial for the patient as it improves blood rheology as has been shown by many studies.

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:24.900
Another transfusion alternative technique for selected surgeries is induced hypotension to lower mean arterial pressure intraoperatively.

00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:32.900
Usually, a drug is used to decrease systemic vascular resistance. This typically prevents up to 50% of blood loss.

00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:43.900
Anesthesiologists urge caution when combining hypotension with hemodolution because hypotension can interfere with the normal redistribution of blood flow.

00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:50.900
A crucial factor that requires skill and patience is meticulous surgical hemostasis and technique.

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:57.900
I teach the residents to just gently score the scan and open it and then use the calorie to get all the blood vessels.

00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:01.900
The basic technique for a surgeon to control bleeding is to ligate the vessels.

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:05.900
That's true for all the vessels, let's say, down to one millimeter in diameter.

00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:13.900
If there's some bleeding persisting, there are calculation techniques, best of which is at the moment argon beam calculations.

00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:16.900
We use it routinely in liver transplantation.

00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:20.900
Hemostatic agents can also assist.

00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:31.900
There is two types of agents, general agents that could be administered intravenously, such as trannix amicacid or aprotinin.

00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:43.900
And the surgeons have also the possibility to use topical glues in order to better control the bleeding in the surgical field.

00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:49.900
Here a fibrin gloopad is directly applied to the dissected surface of a liver.

00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:55.900
This product containing a blood fraction is accepted by a number of Jehovah's Witnesses and others.

00:20:55.900 --> 00:21:01.900
The final intraoperative transfusion alternative is called cell salvage.

00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:10.900
If intraoperative bleeding becomes heavy, a cell salvage machine, often kept on standby, is able to recover the shed blood.

00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:22.900
As the blood flows through the device, some machines simply filter out any debris, while other types include the additional step of washing the red cells as they circulate.

00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:29.900
A cell salvage machine can save up to 50% of the blood that would otherwise be lost.

00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:34.900
Such devices are acceptable to a number of patients who are Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:44.900
Cell salvage is a very important technique because when you use cell salvage, the blood lost by the surgeon is not lost for the patient.

00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:53.900
Cell salvage is usually used when you expect the blood loss in the range of one liter and more, for an adult patient.

00:21:53.900 --> 00:22:04.900
Periopality blood salvage is a very useful technique for blood conservation, because it's very easy to organize in the majority of operations.

00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:13.900
Cardiovascular, orthopaedic, gynecological and so on, so it can be widely applied in surgery.

00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:19.900
Some machines allow cell salvage on a small child, expanding the horizons of the technique.

00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:25.900
Often, simple cell salvage machines are also very valuable in the post-operative setting.

00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:32.900
What we tend to do, particularly for knees, where it's often done with a tourniquet and there is no intraoperative loss, we salvage it immediately afterwards.

00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:41.900
It's very simple and very useful and moderately cheap, just the stuff that comes out, filter it and give it back.

00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:48.900
And we've been doing that here now for about four years and we're very pleased with the success rate.

00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:56.900
Another important consideration for minimizing blood loss is the use of micro-sampling for necessary tests.

00:22:56.900 --> 00:23:03.900
Micro-sampling is critical in both pre-operative and post-operative care of infants and anemic adults.

00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:08.900
Professor Mikhail Obladen addresses the challenge presented by premature infants.

00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:15.900
It helps teaching the doctor the amount of blood really required and not to take more.

00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:21.900
And formally, it was if in doubt, take half a millilitre more.

00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:25.900
And we don't speak about milliliters anymore, we speak about micro-liters.

00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:36.900
The whole process of sampling is documented in the baby's chart so that everyone is aware about the cumulative amount of blood withdrawn.

00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:39.900
Professor Ernest Moore on micro-sampling adults.

00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:45.900
If you add up the blood samples, it's remarkable how much is taken off in a week of the ICU care.

00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:56.900
So certainly using microtubule type of analysis, we can markedly reduce the number of CCs of blood loss today for sampling.

00:23:56.900 --> 00:24:05.900
Physicians who advocate transfusion alternative strategies are often asked if these same strategies are applicable to trauma

00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:07.900
or emergency care.

00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:13.900
When you're looking at principles and patients who have trauma or massive blood, unanticipated blood loss,

00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:17.900
is first and foremost, act quickly.

00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:23.900
The cessation of bleeding with a surgically or another means must be the first principle.

00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:33.900
The second one is that one can apply these modalities such as cell salvage on the specific circumstances

00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:36.900
and recoup the patient's own blood.

00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:43.900
The anesthesiological concept are to tolerate a certain degree of relatively low blood pressure

00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:54.900
and to be a little restrictive in infusing enormous amounts of volume, particularly before a surgical source control has been achieved,

00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:59.900
that means before the surgical bleeding have been identified and stopped.

00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:09.900
Perhaps one of the, I think, greatest advances in conserving blood and trauma has been the concept of so-called damage control surgery.

00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:22.900
That is, once we open the patient's abdomen or chest and note that the patient is unable to coagulate that we address the major bleeding vessels,

00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:32.900
then control the surface with pads and close the patient temporarily, allowing them to be taken to the intensive care unit

00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:43.900
where their resuscitation is continued and efforts to reverse those adverse effects on coagulation like hypothermia are specifically addressed.

00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:54.900
Introma management remorning is very important because during advanced hypothermia, blood coagulation doesn't function properly and therefore the blood loss is larger.

00:25:54.900 --> 00:25:58.900
Professor Moore reviews additional effective steps.

00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:09.900
As you move into the intensive care unit in the more complex problems, then I think the use of earth report becomes even more compelling in the trauma patient.

00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:20.900
In Jehovah's Witness patient, we have no delay in providing both earth report and iron immediately after they arrive in the hospital.

00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:34.900
We may, in fact, do preemptive interventional radiologic evaluation of solid organs and embolize arteries that are not currently bleeding actively but are at risk for bleeding later.

00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:40.900
This brief overview of strategies is properly viewed as a comprehensive concept.

00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:55.900
To say there's a list of transfusion alternatives is correct but that really does not get to the heart of the issue and that is that we must use those alternatives in multiple combinations focused on the patient.

00:26:56.900 --> 00:27:02.900
Not everyone needs every strategy, the earth report and being a very good example of that.

00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:12.900
Dr. Todd Rosengaard has published two major studies on multi-modality blood conservation in coronary artery bypass operations performed without allergenic transfusion.

00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:24.900
When we looked at a series of 50 Jehovah's Witness patients and 100 patients in the general population, we found a short olympus day and a lower cost using our blood conservation strategy.

00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:30.900
Medicine gives every indication of rapid advancement in this new millennium in the meantime.

00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:45.900
I think all physicians should be interested in blood conservation strategies because there is substantial evidence that reductions in morbidity and mortality and reductions in cost can come with these strategies.

00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:51.900
The less blood that is transfused in a given surgical program could be used as an index of the quality of that program.

00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:56.900
I think that the safest transfusion is the transfusion never given.

00:27:56.900 --> 00:28:06.900
And blood conservation is a very simple method which makes things rather smooth, less expensive and with a better outlook for the patient.

00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:13.900
I think there are some very simple, very cheap things you can do to help the majority of people and this could be done in the smallest of hospitals.

00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:20.900
Transfusion alternatives are safe. This is not just something I use for the Jehovah's Witness patient for example.

00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:30.900
I use this for every patient who comes to me. Transfusion alternatives clearly are good medical practice, sound medical practice, safe practice for our patients.
