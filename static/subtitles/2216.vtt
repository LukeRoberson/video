00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.669
Our bodies are made up of trillions of cells.

00:00:06.669 --> 00:00:14.949
Yet each individual cell is a marvel of design and organization.

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:20.949
Inside our cells, biological processes signal specific proteins

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:27.390
to assemble themselves into tracks called microtubules.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.390
Tiny molecular machines called kinesins then transport various components

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.390
to different parts of the cell.

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:50.090
By walking along the tracks, from microscopic proteins to enormous galaxies,

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:56.090
our organized universe abounds with examples of elegant design.

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:08.650
As a mechanical design educator, I view even natural things from a design perspective.

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:13.650
Mechanical design considers not only the individual components of a machine

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.650
but also how they interact.

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:23.650
From this viewpoint, human vision is a magnificent example of design.

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:30.650
For a single eye, the cornea, the iris, and the lens interact to focus an image on the retina.

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:35.650
The light-sensitive cells of the retina call photoreceptors produce nerve signals.

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:40.650
Signals from the rod and cone photoreceptors are transmitted by the optic nerve

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.650
to the brain where they are processed to produce a perceived image.

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:52.650
Now, just imagine the multiplied complexity when two eyes interact.

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:58.650
Particularly mind-boggling is the amount of information being constantly processed

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:04.650
by more than 130 million retinal receptors and then transmitted

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:10.650
through the 1.2 million nerve fibers of the optic nerve to the brain.

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:16.650
To me, the sheer complexity of how all these components flawlessly interact

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.960
is evidence of a superior designer.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.960
Some disagree.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.960
They propose that the eye evolve from a light-sensitive patch

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.960
and some ancestral creature through small random changes.

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.960
I find the proposed process unrealistic.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:39.960
Unlike design, it is unplanned and without a goal.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:45.960
We are asked to imagine that a complex system can develop without direction

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.960
while in the natural world things tend to become disorganized,

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.960
but consider something even more mind-boggling.

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:58.960
The design of the eye, the optic nerve, and brain, and how they function and interact

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.960
are completely documented in our DNA.

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:09.960
In fact, our DNA contains all the instructions for building an entire human body.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:16.960
While science relies only on physical explanations, many individual scientists reason

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:21.960
that highly-ordered natural systems are evidence of a designer.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:29.960
My personal conclusion is that there is a god who is revealed in the magnificent designs of nature.
