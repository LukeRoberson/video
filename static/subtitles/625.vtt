00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:07.440
When you read Psalm 116, what do you discern about the writer of the song?

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.960
In verse 1, he says, I love Jehovah because

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:22.559
he hears my voice, my plea for help, for he inclines his ear to me, or the footnote says,

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:26.320
he bends down to listen to me.

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:31.600
And I will call on him as long as I love.

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:40.609
Well, the Psalmist faced a life-threatening situation. He didn't know if he would survive.

00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:50.770
He called out to Jehovah. And in verse 8, he says, you have rescued me from death, my eye from tears,

00:00:51.570 --> 00:01:01.009
my foot from stumbling. So at the point is, the Psalmist's conviction was based in personal

00:01:01.009 --> 00:01:10.370
experience. He prayed to Jehovah and he saw Jehovah's hand in his life in an answer.

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.689
How about you, and me? Like the Psalmist, do we have anxious moments?

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:25.010
Absolutely. Do we talk to Jehovah in prayer as we should?

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:36.129
What are some anxieties that those of us in full-time service may confront? Well, here are two.

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:46.450
One, concern about family. We may have elderly parents. We may have elderly parents in poor

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:54.049
health. We may have a family member who is struggling spiritually. And all of a sudden,

00:01:54.049 --> 00:02:00.769
we're confronted with decisions. What should I do? What is my scriptural responsibility?

00:02:00.769 --> 00:02:07.170
What does my heart say? What do my circumstances allow me to do? Anxiety.

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:21.169
Here's another concern over past wrongs. Some of us struggle to overcome past mistakes,

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:29.650
and we tend to focus on them. We love Jehovah very much, but sometimes we look at ourselves more

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:38.370
critically than Jehovah does. If we are experiencing one or both of these anxieties, what can we do?

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:46.449
Well, we can do what the Psalmist did. Pray. For a few minutes this morning, let's consider

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:54.050
the prayers of three faithful servants of God who experienced anxiety. We're going to talk about

00:02:54.129 --> 00:03:02.610
Jacob, David, and Jehoshaphat. First, let's consider Jacob. Turn to Genesis chapter 32.

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:13.340
And the context of Jacob's prayer is his reunion with his brother Esau, whom he hadn't seen

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:23.259
in over 20 years. Jacob was concerned. How would Esau receive him? Notice his prayer in verses 11 and

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:33.389
12. Save me. I pray who, from the hand of my brother Esau, for I am afraid of him that he may come and

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:39.629
attack me as well as the mothers and their children. So there was the anxiety. There was the fear.

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:49.229
But notice verse 12. And you have said, I will certainly deal well with you, and I will make your

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:57.069
offspring like the greens of sand of the sea, which are too numerous to count. It's interesting,

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:05.310
isn't it, that in addition to the anxiety, the problem, Jacob also had Jehovah's promises clearly

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:15.069
in mind. And it was his awareness of this bigger picture that helped Jacob handle the matter

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:24.430
in a balanced way. Now, when we are concerned about family members, many questions go through our

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:31.389
mind. And one of them may be, should I leave full-time service? Should I travel? Perhaps thousands

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:39.870
of miles in order to be with my family? We're not suggesting there's one right answer.

00:04:40.829 --> 00:04:48.430
Every situation is different. But what we are suggesting is that by seeing the bigger picture,

00:04:49.709 --> 00:05:00.509
not being hasty to give up full-time service, is it possible in the outworking of matters that Jacob's

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:09.470
anxiety was bigger in his own mind than the problem was in Esau's mind? Well, it could be. And

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:16.750
isn't it true that sometimes, in our effort to resolve difficulties, we may make a bigger

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:23.709
matter of it in our own mind than it is in the minds of our family members. So the suggestion is,

00:05:23.709 --> 00:05:31.389
don't be hasty, look at the big picture, remember Jehovah's promises, and he will help you resolve

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:41.629
your anxiety. What about past mistakes? If you struggle with a tendency to torment yourself over

00:05:41.629 --> 00:05:50.029
past mistakes, it might help you to know that faithful servants of God in the past had the same

00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:58.430
anxiety. For example, Job, going through all of the difficulties that he did, was moved to admit

00:05:58.829 --> 00:06:13.779
the sins of his youth. And David prayed about it. Let's look, Psalm 25, in Psalm 25 verse 7, notice what David

00:06:13.779 --> 00:06:22.740
says, Do not remember the sins of my youth and my transgressions. Remember me according to your

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:30.019
loyal love for the sake of your goodness, O Jehovah. Well, Jehovah has a perfect memory.

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:41.060
He can remember anything he chooses. But David here says, please, Jehovah, forget my past mistakes,

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:49.379
and remember me according to your goodness. Well, sometimes we cling to past mistakes,

00:06:50.259 --> 00:06:58.500
maybe serious mistakes and maybe not so serious. But if we don't overcome that negative thinking,

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:08.019
it can paralyze us spiritual. So what can help? Remembering that Jehovah takes delight in putting

00:07:08.019 --> 00:07:15.379
our transgressions as far away from us as the sunrise is from the sunset. In other words,

00:07:15.379 --> 00:07:21.459
when Jehovah looks at us, he's not looking at our past mistakes. He's looking at the good we're

00:07:21.459 --> 00:07:29.300
doing now. So rather than becoming consumed with anxiety about the past, once we've done what we

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:36.180
can to resolve a matter, set matters straight with Jehovah, leave it in the past and get on with the

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:43.779
business of serving God. There's one more prayer that we want to look at very quickly. In second

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:50.579
Chronicles, chapter 20, please turn there. And the context of this verse,

00:07:52.339 --> 00:07:59.139
Jehoshaphat and the nation of Judah are confronted with an overwhelming force comprised of Moabites,

00:07:59.699 --> 00:08:04.819
Ammonites, and those from the mountainous region of Seaheer. What would they do? Who?

00:08:05.779 --> 00:08:10.740
Jehoshaphat prayed. Second Chronicles, chapter 20, verse 12.

00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:19.220
Oh, our God, will you not execute judgment on them? For we are powerless before this large

00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:28.100
crowd that is coming against us. And notice, we do not know what we should do. But our eyes are

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:36.740
toward you. Well, isn't it true? Sometimes we don't know what we should do. Like Jehoshaphat,

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:43.700
we can humbly acknowledge that to Jehovah. What did Jehovah do for Jehoshaphat? He confused the

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:50.980
enemy. They killed one another and Jehoshaphat didn't have to do anything. What might Jehovah do for

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:57.779
us? Well, his Holy Spirit can help us to remember scriptures that will guide us. We have

00:08:57.779 --> 00:09:03.460
experienced brothers and sisters around us who can help us. And the faithful and discrete slave

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:12.340
has provided an abundance of written material that is available for research. But as in the case

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:20.259
of Jehoshaphat, Jehovah may do something totally unexpected for us. And when that happens,

00:09:20.899 --> 00:09:29.779
when we experience Jehovah's hand in our life, then we speak with conviction as the solmest dead.

00:09:31.299 --> 00:09:42.259
I love Jehovah because he listens to my voice, my pleas for help, and I will call on him as long as I

00:09:42.259 --> 00:09:44.259
love.
