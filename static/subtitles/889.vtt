00:00:01.229 --> 00:00:07.830
I grew up in a big beautiful family, very Jewish, just enjoyed everything, we

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.029
enjoyed each other, we enjoyed our holidays, and so I just felt that I was

00:00:12.029 --> 00:00:18.350
privileged. When I left the house I got married and came to New York, one day a

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:23.269
woman came to my door and said, do you know you could live forever? So I looked

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:28.350
at her and I said, oh really? That's what I thought, you know, but how was that

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.710
possible has never happened. And that's when she said, well, but the Bible says it

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.509
can happen and that's what this book, that's going to tell you how you could

00:00:36.509 --> 00:00:41.789
live forever in paradise. I didn't know that taking the book that day was going

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:48.729
to change my whole life. When she came back, she showed me that God has a name and

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:56.049
that it's Jehovah. I said, you show it to me from my Bible. She opened up to Exodus

00:00:56.049 --> 00:01:02.450
chapter 6 and verse 3 and I saw the Hebrew letters there, you know, hey,

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:08.409
they were no vowel points. I couldn't pronounce it, but I knew it was God's name.

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:18.010
And then from there I just, I had to know more. We were having our study, so she

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:24.090
would always end the prayer with Yeshua Mishia. Mishia, I know means, you know,

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:30.849
blessed one, anointed Mishia. Who was Yeshua? And she said, well, that was Jesus

00:01:30.849 --> 00:01:39.530
Hebrew name. And then she gave me a list of prophecies about Jesus. And I took

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.769
that Bible. It's so worn out now that I think I went through every single

00:01:43.769 --> 00:01:50.450
prophecy. And then the clincher was, of course, Daniel, the ninth chapter. This

00:01:50.450 --> 00:02:00.409
whole part, it just opened my eyes to something that I had never seen before. It

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:09.210
was so precise, the timing, it can't be an accident. So it answered the question

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:13.169
that I had. Why don't we sacrifice? Well, because the Messiah already came and

00:02:13.169 --> 00:02:19.930
sacrificed his life. And now he's presented it to Jehovah in heaven. And so we

00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:25.810
don't have to wafer it anymore. The thought that Jehovah chose his son to come

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:35.409
to earth, to die so that I, insignificant me, can live forever in paradise. I mean,

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:42.370
that's special. So I decided to get baptized and served Jehovah. And I've been

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:50.490
doing it since 1959. Look at, I'm 93 years old. I'm healthy. I'm still going

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:57.960
out in the ministry. And I can still cook chicken soup with mussels. What can I

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:04.240
tell you? I absolutely love teaching the Bible to people. As long as I have

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:11.240
breath in me, I'm going to use it to share with others about Jehovah. And the

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:14.639
Messiah, Jesus.
