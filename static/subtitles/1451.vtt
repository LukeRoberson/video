00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:06.839
In January, we had the privilege to do a shepherding visit on the Angola branch.

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.320
And Angola, like a number of other countries in Africa, is one of those countries that

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.199
has experienced sustained growth for a number of years.

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:21.519
For the past 10 years, they've averaged every year about 5.5% growth in publishers.

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:30.839
So that means they went from 108,000 publishers in 2014 to 170,000 in this last report.

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:36.200
An increase of over 61,000 new ones in the past 10 years.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.200
But it's interesting.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.799
Each branch has its own unique circumstances.

00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:48.759
In Angola, one interesting thing about it is 170,000 publishers nationwide, but almost

00:00:48.759 --> 00:00:53.200
130,000 live in the capital, Luanda.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.840
So 75% of their publishers live in the capital city.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.159
And that presents some interesting situations.

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:04.760
For example, while we were there, the Kukka assembly hall was dedicated.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.560
And here's a picture of it being used for an assembly or a convention.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:15.400
And they have their baptism pool there and beautiful assembly hall changing rooms in the back.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.959
And then I think we have a little cutie there with our Bible in attendance.

00:01:19.959 --> 00:01:24.640
Interesting thing, no parking at all, no parking lot for the Kukka assembly hall, but it's

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:25.640
not needed.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.359
All the friends just walk because there are so many of the witnesses there in the city.

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:38.480
In a 1 kilometer radius of that assembly hall, there are 45 congregations, 2800 publishers,

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.359
in a 2 kilometer radius from that assembly hall.

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:49.680
There are 124 congregations, nearly 8,000 publishers.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.239
Now a new facility, a school facility, is being built in Kukksi, which is just outside

00:01:54.239 --> 00:01:55.519
of Luanda.

00:01:55.519 --> 00:01:59.519
And in the planning process, their brothers wanted to make sure that there would be enough

00:01:59.519 --> 00:02:06.920
local friends in the area that could support that school facility with food needs or maintenance,

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:07.920
cleaning things like that.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.719
And so they did a little review.

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:16.680
And they found that in a 2 kilometer radius of the school location, there are 36 congregations,

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.159
600 publishers, in a 10 kilometer radius.

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:26.280
There are 611 congregations, 47,000 publishers.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.080
So there's plenty of publishers right there to support that, but many of them in the city.

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.199
And so as you can imagine, with so many publishers in the city, it's difficult to keep up with

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:39.240
the demand for new kingdom halls.

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.520
Kingdom halls in the city are more expensive to build and they're more complicated to build.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.400
And so it's not uncommon for a kingdom hall to have a situation where they're supporting

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.479
maybe 10 congregations.

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:53.719
So every weeknight, there has to be two meetings.

00:02:53.719 --> 00:02:58.919
So one meeting starts at 5.30, and then the other meeting starts at 8, which is 15 minutes

00:02:58.919 --> 00:02:59.919
in between.

00:02:59.919 --> 00:03:03.479
And a number of Bethelites have that kind of a situation.

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:08.080
Well, the LDC is working hard, building as many kingdom halls as possible.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.120
They hope to add 40 new kingdom halls this year.

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.080
But in the meantime, everyone who wants a Bible study is getting one.

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.240
Everyone who wants to come to a meeting can come to one.

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:23.919
And then we just keep working hard to provide the kingdom halls as needed.

00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:29.360
Assembly halls are also needed, and in rural areas in Angola, the brothers just do the best

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:34.400
they can to construct a bit of a shelter to keep the brothers out of the sun and out

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.400
of the rain.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.599
And one of the branch committee brothers, a single brother from South Africa, sent us

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:42.759
a few pictures from a convention that he attended last summer.

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:45.800
So you can see the brothers did the best they could to provide a little shelter.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:50.199
But they've got the screens, they're getting the program, they have a baptism pool, and

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:51.199
so forth.

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:56.039
And the friends camp right there, right next to the assembly hall, they bring their tents,

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:57.039
and they're just walking.

00:03:57.039 --> 00:03:59.439
So they just set up their tents, and they camp there.

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:05.479
They get up early in the morning to get their water from the nearby well, and the young

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:06.479
ones do that.

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:07.719
It's a beautiful picture.

00:04:07.719 --> 00:04:13.479
Even in this humble venue, the brothers still want to do what they can to contribute.

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:17.319
And so that touched our heart to see that little contribution box there, and they're doing

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:20.319
everything they can to support the work.

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:25.720
Well, one solution to help friends in this kind of a situation is the simplified assembly

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.720
hall design that many branches in Africa are benefiting from.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:34.720
Here's an artist's rendition of one of the larger models of this.

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.079
And we also just received a couple pictures yesterday.

00:04:37.079 --> 00:04:40.600
This is one that has recently been constructed in Kenya.

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.959
This one is, but it gives you an idea of what these simple tent structures are like.

00:04:43.959 --> 00:04:48.120
They're quick to set up, but they have proper chairs, a proper stage, proper bathrooms,

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.120
but can be constructed more quickly.

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:55.160
And this year Angola is planning to finish at least five of those projects to help

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.040
their friends stay out of the sun in the rain.

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.279
We see Jehovah's blessing on the preaching work.

00:05:00.279 --> 00:05:05.079
So we very much enjoy getting to know our brothers in Angola and see their hard work

00:05:05.079 --> 00:05:07.759
and the results of Jehovah's blessing on their work.
