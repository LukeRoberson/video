00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:09.990
Some years ago, a brother in Mexico from the Rorals dressed in very simple country-guard,

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.390
knocked at the door of a palatial mansion.

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:18.070
A man in a silicon bathrobe responded and asked what he wanted.

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:24.190
The witness said, if a mule should come to your door with two bags of gold, would you

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:25.989
accept it?

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:31.030
No, the householder replied, I do not understand what you're telling me.

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:34.829
I am a famous engineer.

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.950
The witness then asked him, what do you understand about prophecies?

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.549
The man admitted that he did not know anything about them.

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:48.670
Then the witness said, that is what I want to speak to you about.

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:54.469
I am that mule that came to your door, and the two bags of gold are these magazines, the

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:57.469
watchtower and the wake.

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:03.350
The man was impressed by the presentation of this humble witness and took the two magazines.

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.150
Did that man come into the truth?

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.950
We don't know.

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:14.030
But what we do know is that our humble brother gave that man an opportunity for Jehovah to

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.230
stir his heart.

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:22.909
In the first century, many prominent Jews hesitated to follow Jesus because they feared becoming

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:24.950
outcasts.

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:34.069
The account in the Gospel of John, chapter 12, says, many, even of the rulers, actually

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:40.549
put faith in him, but they would not acknowledge him because of the Pharisees so that they would

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:44.549
not be expelled from the synagogue.

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:52.109
However, some overcame social pressure and took a stand for Jesus.

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:58.569
The Bible tells us of Joseph of Arimathea, a reputable member of the council who took

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:04.469
courage and went in before Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:09.789
And the Book of Acts reports that the Word of God continued to spread and a large crowd

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:14.789
of priests began to be obedient to the faith.

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:20.750
An outstanding example of a prominent one is Saul of Tarsus, who later became the Apostle

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.710
Paul.

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:28.349
He was a Pharisee and one who persecuted Jewish Christians.

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:36.349
He admitted this, saying, I persecuted this way to the point of death, binding and handing

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:40.870
over to prisons both men and women.

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:46.710
But he changed and became a zealous preacher and an apostle.

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:54.469
Similarly today, some who had a high social position in this world have become believers.

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:58.030
What helped Saul acquire faith?

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.349
Let's let Paul tell us.

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:09.830
Please turn to Acts chapter 22 and we'll read verses 6 through 8.

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:15.900
Acts 22, 6 through 8, he says.

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:22.620
But as I was traveling and getting near to Damascus about midday, suddenly out of heaven

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:28.819
a great light flashed all around me and I fell to the ground and heard a voice say to

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:35.900
me, Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.020
I answered, who are you Lord?

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:46.860
And he said to me, I am Jesus the Nazarene, whom you are persecuting.

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:53.900
Yes, it was by Jesus miraculously appearing to Saul and identifying himself a shocking

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.020
event.

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:02.340
As a result, Saul completely changed his values and priorities in life.

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:08.460
Later he was inspired to write something that reflects an entirely different viewpoint.

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:10.900
Let's read it.

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:20.139
It's in the book of Philippians chapter 3 and notice what he says in verses 7 and 8.

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:27.420
Yet the things that were gains to me, I have considered loss on account of the Christ.

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:33.779
What is more, I do indeed consider all things to be lost on account of the excelling value

00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:37.459
of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord.

00:04:37.459 --> 00:04:44.459
For his sake, I have taken the loss of all things and considered them as a lot of refuse

00:04:44.459 --> 00:04:48.740
that I may gain Christ.

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:53.100
What was it that moved Paul to have such a change?

00:04:53.100 --> 00:05:01.949
Jehovah used a startling occasion to stir Paul's heart, world events, personal tragedy,

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:08.629
or other change circumstances, though not initiated by Jehovah, may cause a person prominent

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:15.670
in this system of things to reevaluate his or her life and listen to the good news.

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:22.949
Such a person may realize that high social status does not offer a solution to life's problems.

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:29.790
In the following video, note how changing circumstances can affect a person's thinking.

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:37.990
During my high school years, I would work at a shipyard as a third-class welder.

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:42.750
It was difficult in the summer times, it was real hot on the water.

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:47.350
And I just said, wow, if I'm going to have to do this for 30 or 40 years, I've got to

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:49.750
find something better.

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:55.949
In that period of time, success will meant a good job, a lot of money, comfort.

00:05:55.949 --> 00:06:01.149
And so I went through college in four years and got an accounting degree.

00:06:01.149 --> 00:06:03.670
Every time I would get a transfer, I would get promoted.

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:11.350
I went from Africa to Belgium, from Belgium to Scotland, Scotland back to the U.S.

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:13.990
and then the U.S. to Singapore.

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:17.189
And that was really a big jump.

00:06:17.189 --> 00:06:23.750
Nice cars, a driver, putting a whole lot of money in the bank.

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:28.709
And every time I would reach one of these goals, my wife and I would sit at the table and

00:06:28.709 --> 00:06:31.949
say, now, now we're going to be happy.

00:06:31.949 --> 00:06:35.389
Now we're going to finally start to be able to enjoy this.

00:06:35.389 --> 00:06:40.149
But it was like something fleeting, it just wasn't there.

00:06:40.149 --> 00:06:46.670
The emptiness was growing bigger, the hole was getting larger, we were just perplexed.

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:51.509
We didn't know where to go to find any kind of joy or happiness.

00:06:51.509 --> 00:06:58.949
Well my daughter, she had a baby shop, so baby clothes and small baby furniture.

00:06:58.949 --> 00:07:00.990
Her and her husband ran the shop.

00:07:01.029 --> 00:07:05.470
So they hired this young girl to help with the store and to help with their children.

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:10.430
But when she wasn't busy with the story with the children, she'd pull open her Bible

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:12.670
and she would be reading her Bible.

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:19.829
So they asked this young girl, do you know anybody that could study with the two kids?

00:07:19.829 --> 00:07:24.470
She said, I have the perfect people, the perfect couple.

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:28.750
And so they set up a study the following week, one night during the week.

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:33.310
My daughter called me and said, Dad, can you come to this Bible study?

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:35.470
I don't know these people.

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:39.389
And you just need to be there to make sure it's on the up and up.

00:07:39.389 --> 00:07:43.230
And so I came to that first Bible study and I watched it.

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:45.230
I just sat there amazed.

00:07:46.509 --> 00:07:54.300
But when the study was over, I asked him, I said, would you be interested in studying with me?

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:57.620
You know, in the world, you may hit these goals.

00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:01.540
But then very quickly after that, you're going way down.

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:03.819
And then you stay way down.

00:08:03.819 --> 00:08:06.459
The truth brings you a constant joy.

00:08:06.459 --> 00:08:08.819
It is there's nothing like it.

00:08:08.819 --> 00:08:10.980
It's just complete satisfaction.

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:13.579
You just know now you're doing the right thing.

00:08:13.579 --> 00:08:16.899
And it's just changed our whole life now and our whole attitude.

00:08:16.899 --> 00:08:24.509
We are just so very content and happy.

00:08:24.509 --> 00:08:30.110
Dear brothers, we are being encouraged to give a bold witness to prominent ones.

00:08:31.069 --> 00:08:37.990
It's natural that at times we may feel intimidated by prominent ones and hesitate to give a witness.

00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:43.789
But let's determine to imitate Jesus in what way?

00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:50.769
Notice what Isaiah chapter 11 and verse 3 says about him.

00:08:50.769 --> 00:08:54.769
And he will find a light in the fear of Jehovah.

00:08:54.769 --> 00:08:58.570
He will not judge by what appears to his eyes.

00:08:58.769 --> 00:09:04.299
Nor reproves simply according to what his ears hear.

00:09:04.299 --> 00:09:06.580
Did you notice that?

00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:11.860
So like Jesus who does not judge by what appears to his eyes,

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:16.700
we do not want to predetermine a person's response by their outward appearance,

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:21.899
their large homes, their prominence or position.

00:09:21.899 --> 00:09:28.259
We also want to imitate the Apostle Paul in his attitude after he became a Christian.

00:09:28.299 --> 00:09:35.019
Notice what he says in the book of Romans chapter 1.

00:09:35.019 --> 00:09:38.860
We're going to key in in verse 16.

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:46.360
That's Romans chapter 1 and verse 16.

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:50.480
First we'll read the first part of that verse.

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:57.879
It says, for I am not ashamed of the good news.

00:09:57.879 --> 00:10:05.559
Now under inspiration, he then comments on the effectiveness of preaching the good news when he says,

00:10:05.559 --> 00:10:16.240
it, that is the good news, is in fact God's power for salvation to everyone having faith,

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:20.960
to the Jew first and also to the Greek.

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:26.480
So let's be determined to preach boldly to all,

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:33.139
giving Jehovah the opportunity to stir the hearts of those who listen.

00:10:33.139 --> 00:10:38.700
Brother Anthony Morris of the governing body will now consider the final talk of this symposium.

00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:44.899
Remember, faithless people can acquire faith, non-religious people.
