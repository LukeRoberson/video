00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:07.139
There is something common to every successful marriage between two Christians.

00:00:07.139 --> 00:00:12.939
It is their putting Jehovah first and supporting each other's personal dedication to God.

00:00:12.939 --> 00:00:19.579
This is certainly true with Viv and Anne Moritz, serving in the Australasia branch.

00:00:19.579 --> 00:00:28.019
They've been married for 65 years and have a combined 1931 years and full-time service.

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:35.350
According to their advice for younger ones, deciding what to do in Jehovah's organization.

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:41.229
I started pioneering in November, 1948, and it's a while to go now.

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:43.710
And that's what I thought I would do, pioneering.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:54.539
So I said, well, if I do what you ask me, I accept whatever assignment you give me and

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.140
I'll just go where you send me.

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.939
And I won't seek an assignment, but I won't refuse one.

00:00:59.939 --> 00:01:02.100
That's what I intended to do as far as I knew.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.579
And then I'd only been pioneering about a year when I got this envelope.

00:01:05.579 --> 00:01:08.819
And I'd let her say, please fill in, then close for.

00:01:08.819 --> 00:01:10.579
It was an application for Bethel.

00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:13.180
And I thought, couldn't I didn't think of Bethel?

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:19.090
I told Jehovah I'd go where he sent me, so don't do it, you just do it.

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:25.329
I was working in a printer, cleaning out old ink tins and making schedules for printing and so on.

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:28.930
And then I got to work on a press too.

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:34.620
But I wasn't there very long when they moved me to the office.

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:37.219
Well, you learn a lot in Bethel.

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:41.299
Learn how to live with your brothers, which you're not used to.

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:45.579
You learn about Jehovah's organization, you see how it operates.

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:51.780
I had the privilege of working alongside brothers who had lots of experience.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.019
I got assigned to a Metropolitan Congregation.

00:01:55.019 --> 00:01:57.420
That's where Anne was.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.060
Here we got married in October 1951.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.900
And two weeks later, I started pioneering.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.659
I was 20 at that time when we started circuit work.

00:02:09.659 --> 00:02:12.539
And I'd only pioneered for years.

00:02:12.539 --> 00:02:18.659
So of course, I was very worried and scared about having to witness with sisters.

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:20.620
The pioneered for years.

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.740
And some of them even of the anointed.

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.740
I, yeah, I cried half made of milk.

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.539
I'm very close to the brothers and sisters and especially to the children.

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:33.379
So we really loved that.

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:36.819
And then we got the opportunity to go to

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:42.659
go to New York, Dean's National Convention in 1958.

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:46.300
When the society found out we were going, they sent us an application for Gilly.

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:51.500
And we thought, oh my goodness, how can we do that?

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.229
So we said, well, we don't say no.

00:02:56.229 --> 00:03:03.270
After 58 convention, we were assigned to special pioneer in Canada for six months.

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:06.310
Brother Norse and we were in cold storage.

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.069
That 40 hours from British Commonwealth countries.

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:12.870
So that was a good experience too.

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.469
We saw winter for the first time.

00:03:14.469 --> 00:03:16.710
I did anyway.

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:20.270
And we took pictures of snow and ice and ice and it was to show.

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:24.270
And our son met when we got it to India or Africa or somewhere.

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:29.610
And you have a sense of humor, a sense of feeling.

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.849
Well, the schooling you get from Gilead or the other schools

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:40.419
helps you to see Jehovah's organization and how it works.

00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:47.219
We didn't know a lot about Finland except that we knew it was cold and clean

00:03:47.219 --> 00:03:51.819
and a long way from Australia.

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:58.259
Being so far from Australia, we didn't, we knew that we wouldn't be able to get home

00:03:58.259 --> 00:04:04.810
to see our families not for a long, long time.

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.530
When we moved into Finland, the brothers in Russia and those countries

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.370
were on the ban.

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:16.129
They needed spiritual food and so it had to be supplied to them.

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:19.889
So we used to send people in as tourists and they would meet the brothers

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:24.290
they had delivered the food to them.

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:29.529
Without Jehovah's blessing and his spirit, we couldn't have done this tool.

00:04:29.529 --> 00:04:34.769
It's amazing to think that the amount of spiritual food that got in there.

00:04:34.769 --> 00:04:38.250
They translated it and they made it available.

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:42.490
And we did that for over 20 years without any mishaps.

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.610
It couldn't happen without Jehovah's blessing.

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.689
Leaving Finland was not easy, of course.

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:54.329
We had mixed feelings, but actually I saw Jehovah's hand in the assignment

00:04:54.329 --> 00:04:59.689
because we really got back to Australia to time when my parents were needing help.

00:04:59.689 --> 00:05:05.850
So we didn't have to leave Bethel or full time service to give that help.

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:11.930
We were asked to go to Russia in 1999 and it turned out to be two and a half years.

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:15.529
I was a little apprehensive about going to Russia, but it was really

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:20.379
one of the most memorable assignments we've ever had.

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:24.220
In Russia, the brothers were not used to house-to-house work

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:27.500
because of all the years under ban.

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.899
And that was quite different because you go to the door.

00:05:29.899 --> 00:05:32.139
You can't just strike up a conversation.

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:34.779
The person wants to know why you were there.

00:05:34.779 --> 00:05:37.660
And you can't make a return visit on someone you met on the street

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:39.339
when you don't know where he lives.

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:42.620
Of course, he's how she do and you can make a return visit.

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:46.699
The brothers saw the advantage of that, but they had to learn.

00:05:46.699 --> 00:05:48.459
It was a new thing.

00:05:48.459 --> 00:05:52.620
Circuit overseers had to learn how to visit congregations in Polish.

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:55.420
Brothers came in and helped a lot with that.

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:59.420
It's a good work, but they too had to learn.

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:02.939
So it was a big change for them to come from working under ban

00:06:02.939 --> 00:06:10.220
all their lives to now working the way the rest of the world does.

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:15.100
The best decision I ever made was to move my life in Jehovah's hands.

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:20.220
And to say, you decide where I go and what I do.

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:23.740
I've had the feeling all along and it's proven true so far

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:28.220
that everything I have done has been training for something else.

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:30.699
So what I'm doing now is still training.

00:06:30.699 --> 00:06:35.019
It must be for the new world because I haven't got much time left in this one.

00:06:35.019 --> 00:06:36.459
What will it be?

00:06:36.459 --> 00:06:41.029
Well, who knows?

00:06:41.029 --> 00:06:45.589
To my recommendation to everyone is, don't decide to yourself.

00:06:45.589 --> 00:06:50.019
Let Jehovah do it.

00:06:50.019 --> 00:06:53.620
Brother and sister Maritz always looked at Jehovah for their assignments.

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:59.379
For Brother Maritz, that's meant serving on the branch committees in Finland,

00:06:59.379 --> 00:07:03.540
India, Russia, Poland, Ukraine, and Australia,

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:08.579
Asia, and the privilege of making visits to more than 70 countries

00:07:08.579 --> 00:07:12.660
as a representative of World Headquarters.

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:17.459
We can certainly pursue any form of service that our circumstances allow,

00:07:17.459 --> 00:07:20.339
but when we pray for Jehovah's direction,

00:07:20.339 --> 00:07:24.660
we rely on him to send us where it benefits his organization

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:26.660
and ourselves the most.
