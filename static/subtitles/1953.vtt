00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:04.879
Does God have a name?

00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:11.019
The Bible mentions the names of many gods.

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:16.969
The nation's surrounding ancient Israel worship did his name

00:00:16.969 --> 00:00:19.969
Asteroeth, Bale, and Molec.

00:00:19.969 --> 00:00:23.969
The first-century Christians lived among people who worship

00:00:23.969 --> 00:00:28.969
such deities as Ottomans, Hermes, and Zeus.

00:00:28.969 --> 00:00:32.969
And the names of those gods are recorded in the Bible.

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:36.969
The Bible acknowledges that there are many gods,

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:40.969
but the name of one god appears in ancient manuscripts of the Bible

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:46.969
far more times than the names of all the other gods combined.

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:52.969
If you read modern Bibles, you will still find the names of the other gods.

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:59.969
However, many Bibles have removed the name of the most frequently mentioned god.

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.969
The name of that god appears some 7,000 times in the oldest versions of the Bible.

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:09.969
Who is the god whose name has been removed from the Bible?

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:18.099
The first part of the Bible, often called the Old Testament,

00:01:18.099 --> 00:01:22.099
was written in Hebrew, and a related language are a make.

00:01:22.099 --> 00:01:26.099
In Hebrew, God's name is represented by four letters.

00:01:26.099 --> 00:01:29.099
Hebrew is read from right to left.

00:01:29.099 --> 00:01:33.099
In English, those four letters are rendered by the consonants,

00:01:33.099 --> 00:01:36.099
Y, H, W, H.

00:01:36.099 --> 00:01:43.040
The original vowel sounds used in God's name are unknown.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.040
For the four letters, representing God's name,

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.040
appear throughout ancient Bible manuscripts,

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.040
and have been inscribed in many other locations.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:02:00.819
In English, a popular rendering of God's name is Jehovah.

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:03.819
Another rendering is Yahweh.

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:09.819
Some Bibles use one of these forms of God's name at Psalm 83, verse 18,

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:12.819
and in several other places.

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:17.819
A number of other translations, such as the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures,

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:22.819
restore God's name to the locations in which it originally appeared.

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:29.900
Since God had his personal name included in the Bibles of the 7,000 times,

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.900
he no doubt wants us to know and use that name.

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:40.949
In the law God gave to Israel, he told Moses to write,

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:46.949
listen, or Israel, Jehovah are God is one Jehovah.

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:55.620
Jesus quoted that passage from the law, so he obviously knew and used God's personal name.

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.620
In one of his final prayers before his death, Jesus said to Jehovah God,

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:06.500
I have made your name known.

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:19.039
A man can have many titles, husband, father, architect, and a personal name, such as John.

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:29.039
In the same way, God has many appropriate titles, Almighty, Creator, and Lord.

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:35.039
He also has a unique name, one not shared by any other God.

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:38.039
That name is Jehovah.

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:45.069
You may wonder, what is God like?

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:48.069
Does God care about you?

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:51.069
How can you know God personally?

00:03:51.069 --> 00:04:02.860
