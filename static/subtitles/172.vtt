00:00:01.139 --> 00:00:06.139
The theme is, stop being molded by this system of things.

00:00:07.139 --> 00:00:13.140
In describing Godly wisdom, the ancient man Job recognized it as priceless.

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:19.140
At Job 28 17, he said, gold and glass cannot be compared to it.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:26.140
Glass has been around for centuries, even back in Job's day.

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:32.140
However, what revolutionized glass production was the invention of glass blowing.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:41.140
By blowing through a hollow tube, a glass bowler can quickly mold superheated molded glass into a specific shape.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:52.140
Satan's system has developed the art of shaping the minds of people into fragile glass vessels with little useful purpose.

00:00:53.140 --> 00:01:05.450
In fact, Romans 9.22 refers to such ones as vessels of wrath made fit for destruction. Find with me, Romans 12.2.

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:13.450
What is responsible for molding and shaping the inclinations of the people of the world?

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:29.450
And stop being molded by this system of things, but be transformed by making your mind over, so that you may prove to yourselves the good and acceptable and perfect will of God.

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:36.450
To counteract being molded, the verse said, but be transformed by making your mind over.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:44.450
So the molding of this system is related to our thinking, the shaping of our minds.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.450
But what evil air is blown down the hollow tube?

00:01:49.450 --> 00:02:02.299
It's identified quite clearly for us at Ephesians 2, 2, and 3, concerning a Christian's previous unclean thinking and behavior, verse 2 says,

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:07.299
in which you at one time walked according to the system of things of this world.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:17.300
According to the ruler of the authority of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:22.300
The verse makes clear that this system of things has a ruler.

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.300
Satan is called the ruler of the authority of the air.

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.300
The verse indicates that the air is the spirit of the world.

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:37.300
But with such a mindset, what kind of behavior does the thinking of the world lead to?

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.300
Verse 3.

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:56.300
Yes, among them, we all at one time conducted ourselves in harmony with the desires of our flesh, carrying out the will of the flesh, and of our thoughts, and we were naturally children of wrath just as the rest.

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:03.300
For this reason, they become vessels of wrath made fit for destruction.

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:07.300
Glassblowers often work in groups known as shops.

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:12.300
An apprentice dips a hollow blowpipe into the liquid glass.

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:17.300
By twirling it, he gathers a blob of molten glass.

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:22.300
He shapes the blob by rolling it on a smooth surface called a marver.

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.300
He then passes the tube to the gaffer or shop master.

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:30.300
He blows air into the tube and fashions the glass into a globe.

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:39.300
Well, if a wine glass is being made, the tube is then passed to the stem maker, and another gather of glass is attached.

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:45.300
It's then shaped by means of long pointed tongs to form the stem.

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:49.300
Then another gather of hot glass is added to the stem.

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:52.300
The craftsman rolls the tube on the arm of his chair.

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:56.300
He forms the base of the glass.

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:05.300
We will briefly consider four ways that this system subtly tries to shape our mind into Satan's designs.

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:09.300
The first is harmful peer pressure.

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:13.300
Now often this is just an apprentice in Satan's shop.

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:17.300
Maybe fellow students in school, fellow workers on the job.

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:23.300
Don't you think Satan will try to capitalize on these circumstantial relationships?

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.300
Absolutely.

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.300
Peer pressure.

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.300
It can have an influence on our mind.

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:36.300
They may make fun of our wholesome morals, our clean speech, our dignified dress.

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.300
That is pressure.

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:43.300
Possibly they invite us to do things that we know will lead to no good.

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:50.300
They are twirling us with their thinking, with their taunts, or maybe with their flattery and temptation.

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.300
They are rolling things over and over in our mind.

00:04:54.300 --> 00:05:00.290
Turn to 2nd Peter, 2 18 and 19.

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:07.660
And as you read this, can you pick out a word that's equivalent to peer pressure?

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:11.660
Let's read 2nd Peter 2 18 and 19.

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:17.660
They make high sounding statements that are empty, like air.

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:22.660
By peeling to the desires of the flesh and with acts of brazen conduct, they entice.

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:24.660
That's peer pressure.

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:29.660
They entice people who have just escaped from those who live an error.

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:35.660
While they are promising them freedom, they themselves are slaves of corruption.

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:41.660
For if anyone has overcome by someone, he is his slave.

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:48.660
The verse says if we're overcome by peer pressure and enticed, we actually become a slave of that person.

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:52.660
That is scary. It's dangerous.

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.660
Peer pressure is deceptively strong.

00:05:55.660 --> 00:06:00.660
But what is another way that the spirit of this system can shape our thinking?

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:09.660
You recall the apprentice passed the glass-blowing tube to the gaffer who blew air into the glass, giving it shape.

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:14.660
What does Satan and this system next use to mold our thinking?

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:17.660
Enticing advertisements.

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:24.660
Like the air of a glass-blower, advertisements often have little substance.

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:29.660
For example, that product we decided to buy when we last went shopping.

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:35.660
Maybe it was a brand of clothing or a brand of dry cereal we bought for breakfast.

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:40.660
Is that always purely a personal, rational decision on our part?

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:47.660
Or did advertising subtly but powerfully affect our choice?

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:52.660
Now, it's not that all advertising is bad or misleading.

00:06:52.660 --> 00:07:01.660
But the more we allow ourselves to be influenced by it, the more we are in danger of being led into a materialistic way of life.

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:09.660
For example, instead of dry cereal, are we now influenced to buy that flashy looking sports car?

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:15.740
Turn to 1st John 215-17.

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:20.740
This system inflates our thinking by means of things.

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:26.740
Do not love either the world or the things in the world.

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:30.740
If anyone loves the world, the love of the father is not in him.

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:37.740
Because everything in the world, the desire of the flesh and the desire of the eyes

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:45.740
and the showy display of one's means of life, does not originate with the father but originates with the world.

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:51.740
Why do we need to resist catering to advertisements that feed the spirit of the world?

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:54.740
Verse 17.

00:07:54.740 --> 00:08:00.740
Furthermore, the world is passing away and so is its desire.

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:05.740
But the one who does the will of God remains forever.

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:10.740
Remember Eve, Satan advertised the forbidden fruit.

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:14.740
The scripture says it was desirable to the eyes.

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:17.740
The tree was pleasing to look at.

00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:23.740
She succumbed to the advertisement with disastrous results.

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:28.740
Similarly, Satan used advertisements to try to reshape Jesus' focus.

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:40.340
Matthew 4 says that Satan showed him all the kingdoms of the world, offering them an exchange for one act of worship.

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:46.360
Jesus simply turned him off.

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:51.360
He won't be overly influenced by advertisements.

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:56.360
But what's the next aspect of this system that can distort our minds?

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:59.360
Bad associations.

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:04.360
It is as if the gaffer has now passed the glass-blowing tube to the stem maker.

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:10.360
He takes another gather of molten glass and attaches it to our globe.

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:15.360
Then he stretches that associated blob into the form of a stem.

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:18.360
But we already talked about pure pressure.

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:23.360
But that often comes from those who are not necessarily our close associates.

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:30.360
What we're discussing now is our decisions about whom we spend a lot of time with.

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:40.360
People who don't love Jehovah can stretch and misshape our minds, providing a stem or a handle for the world to hold us by.

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:43.360
Turn to 1 Corinthians 1533.

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:54.279
Sometimes we hear the phrase that some of the kids in school are nicer than some of the kids in the congregation.

00:09:54.279 --> 00:10:01.279
But usually nicer actually means more fun rather than more wholesome.

00:10:01.279 --> 00:10:06.279
But let's look at 1 Corinthians 1533 in its context.

00:10:06.279 --> 00:10:13.279
What did the Apostle Paul mean when he said to the Corinthians, bad associations?

00:10:13.279 --> 00:10:16.279
1 Corinthians 1533.

00:10:16.279 --> 00:10:18.279
Do not be misled.

00:10:18.279 --> 00:10:22.279
Bad associations spoil useful habits.

00:10:22.279 --> 00:10:26.279
But what made these ones bad associations?

00:10:26.279 --> 00:10:28.279
Let's see it in context.

00:10:28.279 --> 00:10:32.279
Look at 1 Corinthians 1512.

00:10:32.279 --> 00:10:36.279
Now if it is being preached that Christ has been raised from the dead,

00:10:36.279 --> 00:10:41.279
how is it that some among you say there is no resurrection of the dead?

00:10:42.279 --> 00:10:46.279
Well, what was the initial problem with these associates?

00:10:46.279 --> 00:10:49.279
They did not believe the same way.

00:10:49.279 --> 00:10:53.279
Well, why would that make them bad associations?

00:10:53.279 --> 00:11:02.279
Because when an associate believes will eventually affect our thinking and our thinking affects our behavior.

00:11:02.279 --> 00:11:05.279
Notice how Paul describes this.

00:11:05.279 --> 00:11:08.279
Look at 1 Corinthians 1532.

00:11:08.279 --> 00:11:16.279
What good is it to endure the rigors of the Christian race for life if there is no resurrection, no future, no hope?

00:11:16.279 --> 00:11:18.279
1 Corinthians 132.

00:11:18.279 --> 00:11:24.279
If like other men I have fought with wild beasts at Ephesus, of what good is it to me?

00:11:24.279 --> 00:11:31.279
If the dead are not to be raised up, let us eat and drink for tomorrow we are to die.

00:11:31.279 --> 00:11:40.279
May all of us avoid bad association whether in person, on TV or on the internet.

00:11:40.279 --> 00:11:46.279
What's a fourth means by which Satan attempts to fashion us, reshaping our thinking?

00:11:46.279 --> 00:11:49.279
Higher education.

00:11:49.279 --> 00:11:58.279
Most of us remember the January 2015 JW Broadcasting program hosted by Brother Morris of the governing body.

00:11:58.279 --> 00:12:02.279
He focused on the value of divine education.

00:12:02.279 --> 00:12:08.279
But he also reaffirmed the dangers of pursuing higher secular education.

00:12:08.279 --> 00:12:13.279
Its whole purpose is for learning, influencing one's thinking.

00:12:13.279 --> 00:12:20.279
And will a person's intention might be just to create a stable base for a secular future?

00:12:20.279 --> 00:12:26.279
His decision could expose him to unscriptural ideas and practices.

00:12:27.279 --> 00:12:29.279
Back to the glass shop.

00:12:29.279 --> 00:12:34.279
Recall that another gather of hot glass is added to the end of the stem?

00:12:34.279 --> 00:12:38.279
The craftsman then rolls the two backwards and forward.

00:12:38.279 --> 00:12:42.279
He forms the base for the glass.

00:12:42.279 --> 00:12:48.279
Well, we will say no more about this topic other than what Brother Morris has already shared.

00:12:48.279 --> 00:12:52.279
You might want to go back and review that broadcast.

00:12:52.279 --> 00:12:57.279
However, we would like to read 1 Timothy 6, 2021.

00:12:57.279 --> 00:13:02.279
Timothy, guard what has been entrusted to you.

00:13:02.279 --> 00:13:04.279
That's divine education.

00:13:04.279 --> 00:13:13.279
Turning away from the empty speeches that violate what is holy and from the contradictions of the falsely-called knowledge.

00:13:13.279 --> 00:13:19.279
By making a show of such knowledge, some have deviated from the faith.

00:13:20.279 --> 00:13:29.279
Unfortunately, in an effort to make a stable base for one's financial future, many have deviated from the faith.

00:13:29.279 --> 00:13:36.850
In the visuals of a glass-blowing shop, we observed the skill of the workers involved.

00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:42.850
And that shop obviously produces beautiful, useful glass vessels.

00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:48.850
Satan's glass shop is also skilled at shaping one's thinking.

00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:50.850
But what does it produce?

00:13:50.850 --> 00:14:03.129
Instead of a person becoming a valuable vessel that Jehovah can use, Satan is actually mass-producing worthless vessels that Jehovah cannot use.

00:14:03.129 --> 00:14:07.129
What could you do with this mishap creation?

00:14:07.129 --> 00:14:10.129
Nothing, it is useless.

00:14:10.129 --> 00:14:14.129
At the outset, Romans 9.22 was quoted.

00:14:14.129 --> 00:14:22.129
Those who conformed to Satan's system are referred to as vessels of wrath made fit for destruction.

00:14:22.129 --> 00:14:28.169
Jehovah's paid a high price for us.

00:14:28.169 --> 00:14:31.169
Gold and glass cannot be compared to it.

00:14:31.169 --> 00:14:35.169
May we make over our minds by applying godly wisdom.

00:14:35.169 --> 00:14:39.169
Glorified Jehovah is a vessel that he can use.

00:14:39.169 --> 00:14:44.169
1 Corinthians 6.20 concludes this discussion nicely saying,

00:14:44.169 --> 00:14:47.169
for you were bought with a price.

00:14:47.169 --> 00:14:50.169
By all means, glorify God in your body.
