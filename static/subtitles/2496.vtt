00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:11.740
She thought that she could win, but there was no way next year. I'll be the fastest kid in the entire school

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:19.140
That's because I'm not in your school. Oh, please number last time when I beat you in for the whole congregation

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:28.390
Caleb, do you remember this story? Oh

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.829
Yeah, that's a tower of Babel. That's right. Why were these people trying to build this tower?

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:38.950
So they could live there?

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:44.030
Actually, it was because they thought they were awesome and wanted to show off

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.469
But what did you hope a think of that? Oh

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:50.189
He didn't like it

00:00:50.189 --> 00:00:54.710
That's right. He even confused their languages, so they would stop bragging

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:58.789
But at school everyone brags. I know

00:00:59.509 --> 00:01:02.670
Lots of people brag I have bragged too

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:06.430
But that's wrong

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:12.829
When we brag or show off. It's like we're building a tower for ourselves just like the tower of Babel

00:01:13.349 --> 00:01:17.510
If I want to set a new world record, no problem

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:28.700
If you say so, but I'm better at basketball than you, I was just messing around but they say I'm a knackle

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.859
The higher up we try to put ourselves the more dangerous it gets. Do you know why?

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:38.859
Because we'll actually fall

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.629
Oh

00:01:45.629 --> 00:01:47.430
Yes

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:53.790
Also, first Peter 5-5 means that Jehovah doesn't want us acting like we are better than everyone else

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:57.069
humble people don't need to brag

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:01.709
Because Jehovah will make them feel good about themselves on the inside
