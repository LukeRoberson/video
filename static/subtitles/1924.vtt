WEBVTT

00:00:01.139 --> 00:00:04.139
Welcome, brothers and sisters.

00:00:04.139 --> 00:00:09.140
To begin, we have an encouraging update about Eritrea.

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:13.140
You might recall that in April of 2014,

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.140
Eritrea and authorities arrested 31 of our brothers and sisters

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.140
during a peaceful congregation meeting.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:25.140
Sister Mikhail Tadesse and her siblings were among those detained.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.140
Her siblings were later released,

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.140
but sister Mikhail remained imprisoned for her faith.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.140
But we're pleased to announce that on February 25th of 2025,

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.140
after almost 11 years in prison,

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.140
sister Mikhail was released and reunited with her family.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.140
She's in good spirits and is receiving the medical care that she needs.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:55.140
We continue to pray for the 251 brothers and sisters around the world

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.140
who are imprisoned for their faith.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.140
And this includes 65 in Eritrea.

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.140
In our last update,

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:09.140
we reported on various disasters that have affected our brothers and sisters around the world.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.140
In just the first six months of the 2025 service year,

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.140
our brothers and sisters have been affected by over 100 disasters.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.140
But because of your generous donations to the worldwide work,

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.140
so far for this service year,

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.140
we've been able to spend over $6 million to provide relief.

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.140
We thank all of you for your loving support.

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:40.140
Of course, material assistance is just one way that we provide relief to our brothers and sisters.

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.140
We also provide spiritual encouragement and emotional support.

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:52.140
This is highlighted in the following video about our relief efforts in the state of California in the United States.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:59.140
You'll recall that devastating wildfires erupted there in January of this year.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.980
When you go through something like this,

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:09.979
it just, I don't know how to express it.

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:23.009
It changes you when someone loses everything.

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:27.009
The process is overwhelming and they don't know how to recover.

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:29.009
They don't know how to walk through it.

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:33.009
When their recovery effort changes from a load for them,

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:36.009
that they can handle themselves to a burden for them,

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:40.009
that's when the relief organization can help them carry that burden.

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:46.009
The thought at Isaiah, 41-10,

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:50.009
it says there that Jehovah really holds on to us.

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:54.009
And this is something that we've been able to see come to life.

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:57.009
I'm a single sister, single mama.

00:02:57.009 --> 00:03:00.009
When I saw the relief team come in,

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:04.009
that was Jehovah's hand to me, to say,

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:07.009
my people, I've got you.

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:10.009
Our brothers and sisters have gone through great loss,

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:12.009
including even their own homes.

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:16.009
And yet, while the physical needs are handled and helped with,

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:18.009
by means of the disaster relief arrangement,

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:23.009
it's the spiritual needs that also need to be given attention to.

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:27.009
And Jehovah has protected you in the most important way,

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:30.009
because you have not lost your faith,

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:33.009
and you have not lost your relationship with God.

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:39.009
This is Jehovah's physical evidence that he loves you.

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:45.020
We send messages out to friends in the congregation.

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:48.020
We meet blankets, we meet pillows, we meet supplies,

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:52.020
and within probably an hour, things started showing up.

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.020
I appreciate the friends that have taken us in,

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:57.020
and provided for us.

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:00.020
That was so encouraging, so loving,

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:04.020
and you know, it brings you to tears.

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:10.219
You don't know exactly how it's going to work out,

00:04:10.219 --> 00:04:12.219
like you can't pinpoint everything,

00:04:12.219 --> 00:04:15.219
but just know that Jehovah is going to take care of you.

00:04:15.219 --> 00:04:24.560
Just get the sense that Jehovah is guiding us,

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.560
and it's a unique privilege to cry with the friends,

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.560
to hug them, to reassure them,

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.560
that when Jehovah says,

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.560
throw your burden on me, he really means it.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.560
He's always been real,

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.560
but anytime you see his hand in a very real way,

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.560
you just are naturally drawn closer to him.

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.560
So it's a shame that we go through these kinds of events,

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.560
but in every single case,

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.560
every single person,

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.560
from the victim to the person who provides relief,

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:09.009
all draw closer to Jehovah.

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:13.009
We deeply appreciate the hard work and unselfish efforts

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:16.009
of all those at the branch offices,

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:18.009
the circuit overseers,

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:20.009
the disaster relief committee members,

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:23.009
and many other volunteers worldwide.

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:26.009
Of course, all of us who contribute funds

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:29.009
are also essential to this work.

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:32.009
In fact, we all have a share in what Second Corinthians,

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:35.009
chapter 8, verse 4, calls,

00:05:35.009 --> 00:05:38.009
the relief ministry.

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:41.009
And when we support this ministry,

00:05:41.009 --> 00:05:45.009
we also become fellow workers with Jehovah.

00:05:45.009 --> 00:05:49.009
At Psalm 94, verses 17 to 19,

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:52.009
we can see what Jehovah is busy doing for our brothers

00:05:52.009 --> 00:05:55.009
and sisters in times of distress.

00:05:55.009 --> 00:05:56.009
It says,

00:05:56.009 --> 00:05:59.009
if Jehovah had not been my helper,

00:05:59.009 --> 00:06:01.009
I would soon have perished.

00:06:01.009 --> 00:06:02.009
When I said,

00:06:02.009 --> 00:06:04.009
my foot is slipping,

00:06:04.009 --> 00:06:07.009
your loyal love of Jehovah kept supporting me.

00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:10.009
When anxieties overwhelm me,

00:06:10.009 --> 00:06:14.009
you comforted and sued me.

00:06:14.009 --> 00:06:17.009
Another way that Jehovah uses his organization

00:06:17.009 --> 00:06:20.009
to provide support is by means of our efforts

00:06:20.009 --> 00:06:22.009
to promote literacy.

00:06:22.009 --> 00:06:25.009
For decades, we've organized literacy classes.

00:06:25.009 --> 00:06:27.009
We've also prepared publications,

00:06:27.009 --> 00:06:29.009
such as the brochure,

00:06:29.009 --> 00:06:32.009
apply yourself to reading and writing.

00:06:32.009 --> 00:06:34.009
That brochure is currently available

00:06:34.009 --> 00:06:36.009
in 136 languages,

00:06:36.009 --> 00:06:39.009
and more than 10 million copies have been produced.

00:06:39.009 --> 00:06:41.009
A few years ago,

00:06:41.009 --> 00:06:43.009
in a previous governing body update,

00:06:43.009 --> 00:06:45.009
we talked about the importance

00:06:45.009 --> 00:06:48.009
of reading and writing well.

00:06:48.009 --> 00:06:50.009
And since that update,

00:06:50.009 --> 00:06:52.009
the apply yourself to reading and writing brochure

00:06:52.009 --> 00:06:55.009
was made available on JW.org

00:06:55.009 --> 00:06:58.009
so that more could easily have access to it.

00:06:58.009 --> 00:07:00.009
And now in recent times,

00:07:00.009 --> 00:07:02.009
we've been working to simplify

00:07:02.009 --> 00:07:05.009
and speed up the translation and production

00:07:05.009 --> 00:07:09.009
of an updated version of the brochure.

00:07:09.009 --> 00:07:14.009
It's called lessons in reading and writing.

00:07:14.009 --> 00:07:16.009
Currently, selected branches have been invited

00:07:16.009 --> 00:07:21.009
to pilot this new tool in three different languages.

00:07:21.009 --> 00:07:24.009
These branches are also organizing literacy classes,

00:07:24.009 --> 00:07:28.009
so that as many as possible can benefit.

00:07:28.009 --> 00:07:31.009
But why is this so important?

00:07:32.009 --> 00:07:34.009
Let's hear from two branch committee brothers

00:07:34.009 --> 00:07:37.009
who serve in Mozambique.

00:07:37.009 --> 00:07:40.009
Our branch territory has blessed with exciting growth.

00:07:40.009 --> 00:07:43.009
For example, the average number of Bible studies

00:07:43.009 --> 00:07:45.009
is about two per publisher.

00:07:45.009 --> 00:07:48.009
Clearly, there's much potential for further increase.

00:07:48.009 --> 00:07:50.009
While examining the needs of our branch territory

00:07:50.009 --> 00:07:52.009
with the goal of improving,

00:07:52.009 --> 00:07:54.009
we realize that quite a number of our publishers

00:07:54.009 --> 00:07:57.009
do not read and write well.

00:07:57.009 --> 00:07:58.009
And realistically,

00:07:58.009 --> 00:08:00.009
that could limit their participation,

00:08:00.009 --> 00:08:02.009
especially in the Bible study work.

00:08:02.009 --> 00:08:04.009
So to address this concern,

00:08:04.009 --> 00:08:06.009
we've been encouraging the publishers

00:08:06.009 --> 00:08:08.009
to attend literacy classes.

00:08:08.009 --> 00:08:11.009
And the results have been incredible.

00:08:11.009 --> 00:08:14.009
For instance, one couple in Mozambique, Maliko and Zelda,

00:08:14.009 --> 00:08:17.009
never had the opportunity to go to school

00:08:17.009 --> 00:08:19.009
because there were no schools in their area

00:08:19.009 --> 00:08:21.009
and they had to work a lot.

00:08:21.009 --> 00:08:23.009
Because they could not read,

00:08:23.009 --> 00:08:26.009
they could not conduct any Bible studies.

00:08:26.009 --> 00:08:28.009
When the circuit overseer visited their congregation

00:08:28.009 --> 00:08:31.009
in 2022, he encouraged everyone

00:08:31.009 --> 00:08:34.009
to enroll in literacy classes.

00:08:34.009 --> 00:08:37.009
Maliko and Zelda attended a literacy class

00:08:37.009 --> 00:08:39.009
and learned to read.

00:08:39.009 --> 00:08:41.009
Today, Maliko has four Bible studies

00:08:41.009 --> 00:08:43.009
and Zelda has three.

00:08:43.009 --> 00:08:46.009
And all of their students are attending the meetings regularly.

00:08:46.009 --> 00:08:51.009
And Maliko also has become a regular pioneer.

00:08:51.009 --> 00:08:52.009
In another example,

00:08:52.009 --> 00:08:55.009
we have a sister named Anna.

00:08:55.009 --> 00:08:57.009
She did not have access to school

00:08:57.009 --> 00:09:01.009
because she was raised in a remote area of the country.

00:09:01.009 --> 00:09:03.009
At almost 50 years of age,

00:09:03.009 --> 00:09:05.009
she still could not read.

00:09:05.009 --> 00:09:08.009
And it was very difficult for her to conduct Bible studies.

00:09:08.009 --> 00:09:10.009
She tried to start Bible studies

00:09:10.009 --> 00:09:13.009
by only showing the pictures and the illustrations

00:09:13.009 --> 00:09:15.009
in our study publications.

00:09:15.009 --> 00:09:17.009
But due to these limitations,

00:09:17.009 --> 00:09:19.009
those studies would soon end.

00:09:19.009 --> 00:09:21.009
In 2024,

00:09:21.009 --> 00:09:24.009
she attended a literacy class.

00:09:24.009 --> 00:09:27.009
And today, she reads very well.

00:09:27.009 --> 00:09:31.009
She's conducting three progressive Bible studies.

00:09:31.009 --> 00:09:34.009
The Bible students regularly attend meetings.

00:09:34.009 --> 00:09:37.009
And Anna says that she is happy

00:09:37.009 --> 00:09:40.009
and grateful to Jehovah and the organization

00:09:40.009 --> 00:09:43.009
for helping her to learn how to read.

00:09:43.009 --> 00:09:48.340
We're very excited about this pilot program

00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:51.340
to use the updated tool,

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:53.340
lessons in reading and writing.

00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:56.340
And we pray that this initiative

00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:58.340
will help our brothers and sisters learn

00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:00.340
to read and write well,

00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:02.340
to continue growing spiritually,

00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:05.340
and to expand in their ministry.

00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:08.659
All to Jehovah's praise.

00:10:08.659 --> 00:10:11.659
Of course, at this time of year,

00:10:11.659 --> 00:10:13.659
our minds and hearts are focused

00:10:13.659 --> 00:10:16.659
on the upcoming memorial of Jesus' death.

00:10:16.659 --> 00:10:20.659
This year's memorial will be held on Saturday, April 12,

00:10:20.659 --> 00:10:24.659
and the special talk entitled Can Truth Be Found

00:10:24.659 --> 00:10:26.659
will be given in most congregations

00:10:26.659 --> 00:10:30.659
during the week of March 31st.

00:10:30.659 --> 00:10:33.659
As we do every year,

00:10:33.659 --> 00:10:35.659
we want to invite as many as possible

00:10:35.659 --> 00:10:38.659
to attend the special talk in memorial.

00:10:38.659 --> 00:10:40.659
That includes family members,

00:10:40.659 --> 00:10:42.659
Bible students, return visits,

00:10:42.659 --> 00:10:46.659
and any others that we might know.

00:10:46.659 --> 00:10:48.659
And as we invite them,

00:10:49.659 --> 00:10:53.659
let's make good use of the JW.org homepage,

00:10:53.659 --> 00:10:58.659
which will feature content related to these two events.

00:10:58.659 --> 00:11:02.659
Also, have you thought about auxiliary pioneering?

00:11:02.659 --> 00:11:04.659
Remember, all publishers may do so

00:11:04.659 --> 00:11:07.659
with a 15-hour requirement

00:11:07.659 --> 00:11:11.659
during the month of March and April.

00:11:11.659 --> 00:11:15.129
Why not pray about it?

00:11:15.129 --> 00:11:18.129
Reflecting on Jesus' ransom sacrifice

00:11:18.129 --> 00:11:23.129
gives us peace and fills our hearts with gratitude.

00:11:23.129 --> 00:11:27.129
I'm sure you'd agree that we need that peace now

00:11:27.129 --> 00:11:29.129
more than ever before.

00:11:29.129 --> 00:11:33.129
After all, this system of things is so volatile.

00:11:33.129 --> 00:11:35.129
It's like a restless sea,

00:11:35.129 --> 00:11:36.129
and on top of that,

00:11:36.129 --> 00:11:40.129
we face stormy tests of our own faith.

00:11:40.129 --> 00:11:43.129
Despite these stressful circumstances,

00:11:43.129 --> 00:11:45.129
as Jehovah's people,

00:11:45.129 --> 00:11:48.129
we have true peace.

00:11:48.129 --> 00:11:51.129
But how is that possible?

00:11:51.129 --> 00:11:53.129
It's because of a special gift

00:11:53.129 --> 00:11:57.129
that Jesus promised to give His disciples.

00:11:57.129 --> 00:11:59.129
What is that gift?

00:11:59.129 --> 00:12:01.129
Well, let's read His encouraging words

00:12:01.129 --> 00:12:04.129
at John chapter 14 and verse 27,

00:12:04.129 --> 00:12:08.129
that were spoken on the night just before His death.

00:12:08.129 --> 00:12:10.129
Jesus said to them,

00:12:10.129 --> 00:12:12.129
I leave you peace.

00:12:12.129 --> 00:12:15.129
I give you my peace.

00:12:15.129 --> 00:12:18.129
I do not give it to you the way that the world gives it.

00:12:18.129 --> 00:12:21.129
Do not let your hearts be troubled,

00:12:21.129 --> 00:12:24.129
nor let them shrink out of fear.

00:12:24.129 --> 00:12:28.129
Yes, Jesus gave His disciples a wonderful gift.

00:12:28.129 --> 00:12:31.129
What was it?

00:12:31.129 --> 00:12:33.129
Peace.

00:12:33.129 --> 00:12:36.129
And this wasn't simply a lack of conflict.

00:12:36.129 --> 00:12:39.129
No, Jesus said I give you my peace.

00:12:39.129 --> 00:12:41.129
And the peace that Jesus had

00:12:41.129 --> 00:12:44.129
didn't depend on His circumstances.

00:12:44.129 --> 00:12:46.129
He experienced inner peace

00:12:46.129 --> 00:12:48.129
because He knew that Jehovah loved

00:12:48.129 --> 00:12:50.129
and approved of Him.

00:12:50.129 --> 00:12:53.129
And Jesus promised His disciples

00:12:53.129 --> 00:12:57.129
that they too would have this same kind of peace.

00:12:57.129 --> 00:13:03.129
Imagine how this must have comforted their anxious hearts.

00:13:03.129 --> 00:13:05.129
And the same is true for us

00:13:05.129 --> 00:13:09.129
as we face the uncertainties of the last days.

00:13:09.129 --> 00:13:13.129
We're blessed to have a peaceful relationship with Jehovah

00:13:13.129 --> 00:13:15.129
based on our faith in the ransom.

00:13:15.129 --> 00:13:18.129
And that gives us hope.

00:13:18.129 --> 00:13:19.129
It allows us to keep calm

00:13:19.129 --> 00:13:23.129
despite the uncertain times we're living in.

00:13:23.129 --> 00:13:26.129
It stabilizes us.

00:13:26.129 --> 00:13:31.129
Notice the poetic way that Psalm 46 and verse 2 expresses it.

00:13:31.129 --> 00:13:35.129
It says, that is why we will not fear.

00:13:35.129 --> 00:13:37.129
Though the earth undergoes change,

00:13:37.129 --> 00:13:41.129
though the mountains topple into the depths of the sea.

00:13:41.129 --> 00:13:43.129
Doesn't this verse remind us

00:13:43.129 --> 00:13:46.129
of the turbulent times we live in?

00:13:46.129 --> 00:13:48.129
In the last days,

00:13:48.129 --> 00:13:52.129
we may see long-standing mountain-like institutions crumble

00:13:52.129 --> 00:13:56.129
as if they were toppling into the sea.

00:13:56.129 --> 00:14:00.129
And yet, how will we respond?

00:14:00.129 --> 00:14:04.129
Well, the verse says, we will not fear.

00:14:04.129 --> 00:14:06.129
Why not?

00:14:06.129 --> 00:14:09.129
Well, verses 5 to 7 tells us the answer.

00:14:09.129 --> 00:14:13.129
It says, God is in the city.

00:14:13.129 --> 00:14:15.129
It cannot be overthrown.

00:14:15.129 --> 00:14:19.129
God will come to its aid at the break of dawn.

00:14:19.129 --> 00:14:21.129
The nations were in an uproar.

00:14:21.129 --> 00:14:23.129
The kingdoms were overthrown.

00:14:23.129 --> 00:14:27.129
He raised His voice and the earth melted.

00:14:27.129 --> 00:14:30.129
Jehovah of armies is with us.

00:14:30.129 --> 00:14:35.129
The God of Jacob is our secure refuge.

00:14:35.129 --> 00:14:39.129
As the uncertainty of this system increases,

00:14:39.129 --> 00:14:42.129
we do not need to be in fear.

00:14:42.129 --> 00:14:47.129
Remember, God is in full control.

00:14:47.129 --> 00:14:50.129
Jehovah of armies is with us.

00:14:50.129 --> 00:14:52.129
He will come to the aid of His people.

00:14:52.129 --> 00:14:56.129
He is our secure refuge.

00:14:56.129 --> 00:15:00.129
But at times, we may still feel anxiety

00:15:00.129 --> 00:15:04.129
because of the events that are happening around us.

00:15:04.129 --> 00:15:08.129
What does the Bible encourage us to do?

00:15:08.129 --> 00:15:11.129
Ep Philippians 4 and verses 6 and 7

00:15:11.129 --> 00:15:16.129
were encouraged to pour out our hearts to Jehovah.

00:15:16.129 --> 00:15:20.129
And when we do that, what will happen?

00:15:20.129 --> 00:15:22.129
According to verse 7,

00:15:22.129 --> 00:15:26.129
we experience something beyond all understanding,

00:15:26.129 --> 00:15:29.129
the peace of God.

00:15:29.129 --> 00:15:33.129
And that peace will keep us calm and stable

00:15:33.129 --> 00:15:37.129
despite the disturbing things taking place.

00:15:37.129 --> 00:15:41.129
Now, doesn't this motivate us to show our appreciation

00:15:41.129 --> 00:15:46.129
for what God and Christ have done for us by means of the ransom?

00:15:46.129 --> 00:15:49.129
One of the ways we can show our gratitude

00:15:49.129 --> 00:15:51.129
is through the preaching work.

00:15:51.129 --> 00:15:56.129
As we preach, we search for friends of peace,

00:15:56.129 --> 00:16:01.129
those who also want to have peace with God.

00:16:01.129 --> 00:16:03.129
So during this memorial season,

00:16:03.129 --> 00:16:07.129
let's invite as many as we can to learn about

00:16:07.129 --> 00:16:10.129
and to appreciate what Jehovah and Christ Jesus

00:16:10.129 --> 00:16:16.049
have done for us by means of the ransom.

00:16:16.049 --> 00:16:18.049
Before we conclude,

00:16:18.049 --> 00:16:20.049
we're happy to announce the release

00:16:20.049 --> 00:16:24.049
of the 2025 Convention Song entitled

00:16:24.049 --> 00:16:27.049
to do your will is my delight.

00:16:27.049 --> 00:16:30.049
The song and lyrics are now available for download

00:16:30.049 --> 00:16:34.049
in JW Library and on JW.org in English

00:16:34.049 --> 00:16:36.049
and eventually in all the languages

00:16:36.049 --> 00:16:39.049
that will hold the convention.

00:16:39.049 --> 00:16:42.049
The governing body would like everyone

00:16:42.049 --> 00:16:46.049
to practice this song before the convention.

00:16:46.049 --> 00:16:48.049
That way, at the convention,

00:16:48.049 --> 00:16:53.049
we can unitedly sing out from the heart.

00:16:53.049 --> 00:16:56.049
Also, if the words are available in your language,

00:16:56.049 --> 00:16:58.049
you're going to be able to sing this song

00:16:58.049 --> 00:17:02.049
at the midweek meetings during the weeks of April 7th

00:17:02.049 --> 00:17:05.049
and 28th of 2025.

00:17:05.049 --> 00:17:10.779
Brothers and sisters, be assured,

00:17:10.779 --> 00:17:14.779
we love you all very much.

00:17:14.779 --> 00:17:18.779
And please, enjoy the rest of the invitation campaign

00:17:18.779 --> 00:17:22.779
and have a wonderful memorial.

00:17:22.779 --> 00:17:25.779
From the world headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:17:25.779 --> 00:17:29.779
this is JW Broadcasting.
