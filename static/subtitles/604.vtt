00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:08.000
Question, what would you say is one of the greatest gifts that we received from Jehovah?

00:00:09.439 --> 00:00:15.039
Interestingly, the comment that we'll read in a few minutes from the White Star says that perhaps

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:21.199
one of the greatest gifts that we receive from Jehovah is our ability to worship him.

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:26.800
And this gift goes hand in hand with another gift that Jehovah has given us which is highlighted

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:35.119
in today's text. That is our ability to love. But when you think of an ability, an ability is only

00:00:35.119 --> 00:00:42.719
of value if it is developed and if it is put to good use. For example, the child is born with the

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:51.840
ability to walk, but that ability will be of no value if it's not developed and not put to use.

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:58.799
So use our question then, how can we continue to develop our ability to love?

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:07.359
Let's consider two steps. Step number one, by imitating our loving father, Jehovah.

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:14.799
And that is what Paul encourages us to do if we reign together Ephesians chapter 5 verse 1,

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:20.879
where we have our first step, Ephesians 5 verse 1. You notice there are Paul says,

00:01:20.879 --> 00:01:25.599
become imitators of God as beloved children.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:33.840
Very heartwarming to think that we can be like Jehovah. We can imitate him. But the question is,

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:41.280
how? How can we imitate Jehovah? The answer is in the first word, Paul start by saying

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:47.840
therefore. Why? Well, the study note helps us to understand why. So if we take the study note

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:56.560
together for verse 1, you notice it says that Paul has just discussed some of God's qualities,

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:02.239
such as kindness, compassion and forgiveness. So by opening with the word therefore,

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:10.560
he suggests that contemplating or meditating on these qualities can motivate us to imitate

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.159
Jehovah. And that makes sense. It's not true that how do we imitate someone? Well, we first

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:24.400
start by observing and then we act. Well, same is true for imitating Jehovah. We need to observe

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:31.759
him, how? By studying, by meditating on his word and meditation leads to motivation,

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:37.840
which leads to application. But the scripture is very encouraging because you know this,

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:47.280
Paul did not say to imitate God as grown, grown-ups, as adults, but he says no, as beloved children.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:55.520
In other words, Jehovah is reasonable in what he expects of us. The new English version

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:04.879
renders this verse as dear children, try to be like God. And we can have the picture of a child,

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:11.520
four or five years old, trying to walk with his father's shoes. Well, you know, it's not perfect,

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:20.879
but he's trying. But that act puts a smile on his father's face. Same is true for Jehovah. He

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:28.159
appreciates that we're trying to be like him. That takes us to our second step where we find it

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:34.879
in verse two. Paul says to go on walking in love. So that's our second step. Walking in love

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:42.879
just as the Christ also loved us and gave himself for us as an offering and a sacrifice

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:50.879
a sweet fragrance to God. Beautiful word picture when we think of the idea to walking, walking

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:55.919
in love. Walking is a form of exercise. So that's if Paul's saying that we need to exercise love,

00:03:55.919 --> 00:04:04.319
we need to practice love, the easy to read version puts it, we need to live a life of love,

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:11.599
to live a life of love. And coming back to walking, walking is a simple form of exercise.

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:18.079
Paul did not say running in love, but simply walking in love, a simple form of exercise, but

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:27.519
but effective, effective. Love can be simple, but can be very effective. Example,

00:04:27.519 --> 00:04:32.240
few years ago we were serving in Montreal, in Montreal, Canada, and in traveling work.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.959
We visited a congregation and there we met a sister who has experiencing back problems.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:43.360
And at the end of the visit, Crystal sent a little card expressing empathy because she herself had

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:49.920
a face or a dealt with back problems. Five years later, we met the sister.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:57.680
And we didn't know that she still had the card. The simple act of love taught you so much that

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:03.279
she kept the card. And I couldn't help to think that Crystal must have taken what, maybe a few minutes

00:05:03.279 --> 00:05:08.800
to write the card. And I must have spent countless of hours preparing talks, delivering talks.

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:14.560
I'm sure she didn't remember a single word. I said five years later, but she remembered the card.

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:22.720
She kept the card. Love, simple acts, but effective. But the point is, it's not just walking in love.

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:31.360
You know, there's two words precede walking in love. Paul says, go on, go on walking in love.

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:38.209
Because if we stop, we stop being human. And Satan knows that.

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:45.250
Satan knows that the best version of us, we are our best when we give love, when we receive love.

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:54.370
So we need to resist his efforts to dehumanize us by causing us to stop showing love.

00:05:54.930 --> 00:06:02.930
And verse two, Paul highlights the best human example of showing love, walking in love we have,

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:10.129
that of Jesus Christ. And notice the equation Paul highlights here. It says, just as Christ also

00:06:10.129 --> 00:06:20.370
loved us and gave himself. So then from this, we can extract the equation to love equals to give.

00:06:20.529 --> 00:06:29.329
And when I think of this, to love equals to give right away, I think of our dear brothers serving on hospital

00:06:29.329 --> 00:06:36.689
years on committees. Their love moves them to give up their time, their energy, their resources to come to the

00:06:36.689 --> 00:06:43.490
assistance of their brothers, challenging times, the worst time ever possible, and also stressful times.

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:48.769
But they do it out of love, even though most of them don't have a medical background.

00:06:49.329 --> 00:06:57.089
So this brother is definitely deserve our love and our respect. And that is also true for their families.

00:06:58.689 --> 00:07:06.290
What is the reward then for continuing to develop our ability to love? You notice the reward at the

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:16.689
end of verse two, Paul talking about Jesus' sacrifice, he says, his sacrifice is a sweet fragrance

00:07:16.689 --> 00:07:24.290
to God. While same is true for us, as we endeavor to imitate Jesus, as we endeavor to imitate

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:31.889
Jehovah, we can be, for Jehovah, a sweet fragrance. Or in other words, we can, you know,

00:07:31.889 --> 00:07:38.930
cause him to have warm feelings toward us. In reality, what have we learned? We learn that we all

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:45.009
have the ability to love. That's why Jehovah made it a command, which is today's text. But this

00:07:45.009 --> 00:07:52.370
ability needs to be developed. We need to continue to develop it, for it to be value or value,

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:58.449
for it to be useful. And we consider two ways we can do this, one, by imitating Jehovah, and two,

00:07:58.449 --> 00:08:08.930
a simple exercise by walking in love. And when we do, we can go on to live a life of love.
