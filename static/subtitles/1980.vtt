00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:14.949
An introduction to first Peter, the Apostle Peter identifies himself as the writer of his two inspired letters, first and second Peter.

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:20.949
Peter wrote his first letter from Babylon, about 62 to 64 CE.

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:26.949
Peter used Sylvainus, also known as Silas as his secretary.

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:33.950
Sylvainus was likely the Silas who was earlier associated with the Apostle Paul.

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:43.950
Peter addressed his first letter to anointed Christians in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia and Bethinia.

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:54.229
Christians in those lands were experiencing many trials. First Peter has five chapters.

00:00:54.229 --> 00:01:04.230
In chapter 1, Peter reminds his anointed brothers of their new birth to a living hope based on the resurrection of Jesus Christ.

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:12.230
By remaining faithful, they will gain the reward of the unfading inheritance reserved for them in heaven,

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:19.230
so they need to brace up their minds for spiritual activity and guard against fleshly desires.

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:29.230
In chapter 2, the Apostle calls Jesus anointed followers a holy nation and a royal priesthood that shares things with others.

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:40.989
In chapter 3, we read that wives should be in loving subjection to their husbands, just as Sarah was to Abraham.

00:01:40.989 --> 00:01:45.989
Husbands in turn should show honor to their wives.

00:01:46.989 --> 00:02:00.989
Did you know? In his first letter, Peter quotes from at least six Bible books, Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Psalms, Proverbs and Isaiah.

00:02:00.989 --> 00:02:08.990
By quoting God's word, Peter imitated Jesus instead of fine example for us.

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:20.990
In chapter 4, the Apostle emphasizes the need to live for God's will and imitation of Christ, even if this means suffering fiery trials.

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:25.990
He also says that we should be vigilant with a view to prayers.

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:34.990
In chapter 5, Peter appeals to his fellow elders to be selfless and humble shepherds of God's flock.

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:42.990
He then encourages all to throw all their anxieties on God because he cares for them.

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:52.990
As you read first, Peter, note how we should brace up our minds for activity, how husbands and wives should treat each other,

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:58.990
and how we should be willing to endure trials as we wait for God's kingdom to come.
