00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:06.490
Have you ever gone into trouble trying to do the right thing?

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:09.730
If you have, think about Jacob.

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:13.410
Now Jacob did the right thing.

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.149
Rather than marry out of the truth like his brother Esau, he traveled to the home of

00:00:18.149 --> 00:00:24.170
a believing relative, Leibn, and asked for the hand of his daughter, Rachel.

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.129
God didn't work out so well.

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:35.530
Jacob was tricked by Leibn into marrying both Rachel and her older sister, Leah.

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.289
And the women didn't get along very well.

00:00:37.289 --> 00:00:42.250
In fact, they acted more like rivals than like family.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:47.689
Now Jehovah saw what Leibn was up to, but he didn't intervene.

00:00:47.689 --> 00:00:52.689
And Jacob didn't blame Jehovah, as if to say, well, why is this happening to me?

00:00:52.689 --> 00:00:54.009
I followed instructions.

00:00:54.009 --> 00:00:57.409
I did the right thing and had a look where I am today.

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:59.929
That wasn't Jacob.

00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:05.810
Later on, Jehovah fixed the matter by giving the law to Israel.

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:13.010
You must not take a woman in addition to her sister as a rival wife.

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.489
Well, that law seems to have Leah and Rachel written all over it, doesn't it?

00:01:17.489 --> 00:01:19.170
Jehovah fixed the matter.

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.730
But in the meantime, he did sustain Jacob.

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:27.370
He did help Jacob through his trial.

00:01:27.489 --> 00:01:33.209
Now a bright spot in all this was Joseph, and he's the subject of our comment today.

00:01:33.209 --> 00:01:39.650
Jehovah began dealing with Joseph when he was just a teenager, and he gave him two dreams.

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.730
Now the first dream was about food, sheaves of wheat.

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:48.370
His brothers, sheaves, bowed down to his sheath.

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:49.969
Now that was appropriate, wasn't it?

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:56.329
Because later on, not only Joseph's brothers, but almost everyone in the known world

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:59.810
was going to look to Joseph for food.

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:08.610
Now the second dream included his father, and strangely, his mother, who had died giving birth to Benjamin.

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:17.289
Now in that dream, the sun, moon, and eleven stars, that would include Benjamin, bowed down to Joseph.

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:21.810
Now there's no record that Joseph ever attempted to interpret that dream,

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.250
but Jacob and his sons got the point.

00:02:25.289 --> 00:02:27.569
And they were offended.

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:30.930
Jacob kind of accused Joseph of being presumptuous.

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:40.289
He said, am I your mother and your brothers really going to come and bow down to the earth to you?

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:48.409
Now we won't comment on the fact that Jacob automatically assumed that he was the son in that dream.

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:52.449
But by means of the dreams, what was Jehovah telling Joseph?

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:56.610
He was telling Joseph that he had something special in mind for him.

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.849
He had a purpose for Joseph.

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:03.009
So what do you suppose the devil wanted to do?

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:05.849
Well, the devil wanted to frustrate that purpose.

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:09.689
He wanted to keep that purpose from being fulfilled.

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:16.849
So Satan must have been overjoyed when he heard Joseph's brothers plotting to put him to death.

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:19.729
Would they have followed through with it?

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:22.770
Think about Simeon and Levi.

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:29.969
They didn't hesitate to mow down all the men of Sheikam when one man raped their sister.

00:03:29.969 --> 00:03:33.409
Now the oldest of the brothers, 24-year-old Ruben,

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:36.930
talks the others into sparing Joseph's life.

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.210
Now did Jehovah move him to do that?

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:40.770
That could be.

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:42.889
But certainly in line with his purpose.

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:48.289
So instead of killing Joseph, his brothers sell him to a band of Ishmaelites.

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:51.610
Now I want you to tuck that in the back of your mind, Ishmaelites,

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.930
because we're going to come back to that a little later.

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.409
So the Ishmaelites bring Joseph down to Egypt,

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:04.729
and he becomes a slave to Pottifar, the chief of Pharaoh's bodyguard.

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:07.090
Now Joseph is a slave.

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.650
What happens three years later?

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:13.689
His grandfather Isaac dies.

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:18.329
And Joseph, the slave, can't be there to say goodbye.

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:23.290
Kind of reminds us of many of us during this pandemic, doesn't it?

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:27.529
But as with us, Jehovah was with Joseph.

00:04:27.529 --> 00:04:31.129
He was a great success in Pottifar's household

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:34.649
until Pottifar's wife accused him of rape

00:04:34.649 --> 00:04:39.529
and Pottifar threw Joseph into prison.

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:41.850
But we can say that Jehovah was with Joseph

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:45.850
because he went to prison.

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:48.370
Why can we say that?

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.689
Prison was probably the mildest form of punishment

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:53.410
that Joseph could have suffered.

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:56.889
He was a Hebrew slave and under Egyptian law,

00:04:56.889 --> 00:04:59.730
Pottifar could have killed him on the spot

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:01.129
because of the accusations.

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:04.129
Or he could have had Joseph arrested,

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:08.889
and the court could have ordered 1,000 lashes.

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:13.290
Joseph would probably have died under the lash.

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:16.730
Well, that gives us perspective when we read in the Mosaic law

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:21.329
that an Israelite could receive up to 40 strokes of the rod.

00:05:21.329 --> 00:05:23.529
Not 1,000 lashes.

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:25.490
This was love on Jehovah's part.

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:29.850
He wanted to prevent the Israelites from being cruel

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:32.449
like the Egyptians.

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:35.089
Now let's use our imagination a little bit.

00:05:35.089 --> 00:05:38.449
Later on Joseph interprets a dream for Pharaoh

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:40.970
and Pharaoh makes him his chief advisor.

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:45.170
Now imagine, Joseph kneels and receives the signet ring

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:46.850
from Pharaoh.

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:50.649
He rises and takes a step back.

00:05:50.649 --> 00:05:52.370
Out of the corner of his eye,

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:55.290
he sees someone standing near the throne,

00:05:55.290 --> 00:06:00.209
someone who is trying to make himself very small.

00:06:00.209 --> 00:06:05.250
Pottifar, the chief of the bodyguard.

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:08.209
I don't know about you, but that possibility

00:06:08.209 --> 00:06:10.449
makes me smile when I think about it.

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:12.329
And could you imagine what happened

00:06:12.329 --> 00:06:14.850
when Pottifar went home to lunch that day

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:19.410
and told his wife, who was now his new boss?

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:24.079
I wonder how much sleep she lost over that.

00:06:24.079 --> 00:06:27.120
Pottifar's wife did a terrible thing,

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:28.519
but so did Joseph's brothers.

00:06:28.519 --> 00:06:31.160
In fact, if the law had been enforced,

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:33.519
Joseph's brothers would have been put to death

00:06:33.519 --> 00:06:34.480
for kidnapping.

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:39.240
Later, Jehovah made kidnapping a capital offense.

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:43.680
He may have had Joseph's brothers in mind when he did that.

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:47.639
Now some think that Simeon masterminded the kidnapping plot,

00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:51.079
and that might explain why Joseph chose him to stay behind

00:06:51.079 --> 00:06:54.120
when he sent the rest of his brother's home.

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.839
Now let's get back to Jehovah's purpose.

00:06:55.839 --> 00:06:58.319
Jehovah has a purpose for Joseph,

00:06:58.319 --> 00:07:01.319
and Joseph brings the family down to Egypt.

00:07:01.319 --> 00:07:04.639
Now that's part of the prophecy, but there's more.

00:07:04.639 --> 00:07:07.360
Gone told Abraham that his descendants

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:12.839
would be afflicted by foreigners for 400 years.

00:07:12.839 --> 00:07:15.839
Well, Israel left Egypt in 1513 BCE,

00:07:15.839 --> 00:07:18.639
so when did the 400-year start?

00:07:18.639 --> 00:07:20.920
1913.

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:23.240
What happened that year?

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.399
Isaac's half-brother.

00:07:25.399 --> 00:07:27.399
What was his name again?

00:07:27.399 --> 00:07:28.800
Ishmael.

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:32.759
Ishmael persecuted Isaac.

00:07:32.759 --> 00:07:35.399
But was Ishmael a foreigner?

00:07:35.399 --> 00:07:39.240
His mother was an Egyptian slave.

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:43.600
At his descendants, the Ishmaelites had Egyptian blood.

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:47.720
Interesting that the Ishmaelites followed in the family tradition

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:52.399
by persecuting Isaac's grandson, Joseph.

00:07:52.399 --> 00:07:55.519
Jehovah didn't incite Joseph's brothers to kidnap him

00:07:55.519 --> 00:07:58.079
and send him down to Egypt,

00:07:58.079 --> 00:08:01.839
but he did use the event to carry out his purpose.

00:08:01.839 --> 00:08:05.600
He didn't always prevent bad things from happening to Jacob,

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:08.040
like marrying sisters who didn't get along,

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:10.879
or to Joseph, like being falsely accused.

00:08:10.879 --> 00:08:12.800
He didn't put a head around them,

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:14.680
but he did help both of them

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:18.480
to face their trials every step of the way.

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:20.519
He did that for them?

00:08:20.519 --> 00:08:22.600
He'll do it for you too.

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:26.759
So if you ever get in trouble trying to do the right thing,

00:08:26.759 --> 00:08:28.240
think of Jacob.

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:29.920
Think of Jehovah.

00:08:29.959 --> 00:08:31.879
Jehovah will help you.

00:08:31.879 --> 00:08:33.840
He will never abandon you.
