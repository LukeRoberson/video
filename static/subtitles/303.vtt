Another busy day, my daughter's going to preach, I'm off to work, and it's family worship night.

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:17.059
Bye dad. Have a good day sweetie.

00:00:17.059 --> 00:00:28.429
All right let's end up. I got an announcement for everybody.

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:32.429
What? More required overtime?

00:00:32.429 --> 00:00:35.429
Okay that's it, it's all I got. Let's get back to work.

00:00:35.429 --> 00:00:40.429
It's extra money, but how can I do it and take care of Regina?

00:00:57.299 --> 00:01:00.619
Isn't her family worship night?

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:01.619
Maybe a little later sweetie.

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:11.609
I wanted to, but I was spent again.

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:22.280
The world is such a mess. It's everything Jesus said it would be.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.280
She's so good, spiritually minded like her mother was.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:02:23.789
Can I expect she'll stay that way on her own?

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:35.509
If it is just like Noah's day, I need to show faith like he did.

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:40.400
It's our family worship.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:46.680
I need to show faith in Jehovah and work hard to save my family.
