00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:08.960
Well, God's Word is so rich, there's so much in it, and Galatians 6.1 is no exception.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.359
So please, let's turn there, and we're going to read the whole thing.

00:00:13.359 --> 00:00:19.199
And then we're going to analyze Galatians 6.1, phrase by phrase.

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.559
There's a lot in this one verse.

00:00:22.559 --> 00:00:27.359
So Galatians chapter 6 and verse 1,

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:35.600
all right, brothers, even if a man takes a false step before he is aware of it,

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:44.000
you who have spiritual qualifications, try to read just such a man in the spirit of mildness,

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.920
but keep an eye on yourself for fear you too may be tempted.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:56.640
Now the first word is brothers, and we notice that that is in the plural.

00:00:57.759 --> 00:01:01.439
That may be significant, and we're going to come back to that in a few minutes.

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:09.120
Now Paul says, even if a man takes a false step, so what's the metaphor here?

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.120
What is Paul thinking about? Walking.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:21.680
He sees a man who is walking down a path, and all of a sudden he takes a false step.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.159
Now come to think of it, this isn't the first time that Paul mentions walking

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.400
in his letter to the Galatians. Cast your eye on chapter 5.

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:41.840
And notice verse 16, but I say, keep walking by spirit, and you will carry out no fleshly desire

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:50.799
at all. And again, verse 18, furthermore, if you are being led by spirit, you are not under law.

00:01:51.599 --> 00:02:01.359
And once again, verse 25, if we are living by spirit, let us also go on walking orderly by spirit,

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:09.520
literally walking in a straight line. And then chapter 6 and verse 1, brothers, even if a man

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:17.039
takes a false step. So Paul sees a Christian who is walking along, walking in a straight line,

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:25.759
but all of a sudden he takes a false step. Question, is one false step so serious?

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:33.039
Well, those of us who have tried to walk down the uneven pavement on Columbia Heights,

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:42.400
and have taken a false step as we stepped off the curb and wrenched something or put something out,

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:48.960
we can testify that one false step can be serious. And what about you young brothers,

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:55.360
you basketball players? You know that sometimes when you're on the basketball court, you take one

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:03.599
false step and you end up on crutches for a few weeks. So the fact is that one false step can be

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:09.919
serious and interestingly, the Greek word that's translated false step here allows for a variety of

00:03:09.919 --> 00:03:17.199
meanings. It can apply to a minor infraction, but it can also apply to a major transgression,

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:23.039
a major sin. And you'll notice in the comment today when we read it that Galatians 6, 1 is being

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:31.439
applied to a serious sin. So it can be applied to both. Let's carry on. He takes a false step

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:42.240
before he is aware of it. Now, what does that mean? Well, the Greek, the Greek word here indicates

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:48.240
that the sin is not deliberate. He didn't leave home that day with the idea that he was going to

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:55.759
commit a serious sin. It came upon him unawares. He was surprised. Perhaps he got into the wrong

00:03:55.759 --> 00:04:01.520
crowd and all of a sudden he ended up doing something that he really hadn't planned to do.

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:08.879
It is not deliberate, but that doesn't mean that the sin isn't serious. It just means that it was not

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:18.959
intentional. Now, here's help. Help comes on the way. It says, you who have spiritual qualifications.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:25.040
Welcome to think of it, the Galatians would know what these are. Because in chapter 5,

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:32.959
verses 22 and 23, the Apostle Paul outlined the nine aspects of the footage of the spirit,

00:04:32.959 --> 00:04:37.199
so they would know what the spiritual qualifications are, but here's the point.

00:04:38.079 --> 00:04:45.600
As Brother Divine brought out, those who give counsel need to be motivated by the Holy Spirit,

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:55.920
not by frustration, not by anger. This is no knee jerk reaction, a flash of anger or something. No,

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:04.639
the Holy Spirit has to move us to give the counsel. Now, the next word is interesting. It says,

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:12.399
you who have spiritual qualifications, try. Now, you won't find that word in many

00:05:12.399 --> 00:05:17.120
Bibles. I think there's only one other beside the New World translation that says, try.

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:22.480
And most of the Bible translations follow the King James, and the King James that says,

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:29.680
you who are spiritual, restore the man. Now, the Greek allows for both. It allows for an attempt,

00:05:30.319 --> 00:05:35.600
or it can be a direct action. So now, the translators have to choose.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:45.600
The original New World Translation Committee chose, try. Why? Well, they realized that while there

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:51.600
would be an attempt to readjust, the outcome would depend on the person who was being readjusted.

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:58.560
Would he really want to change? Maybe it would be successful, and maybe it wouldn't. And perhaps

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:04.720
because Jehovah's Witnesses probably do more in giving counsel and giving help to people

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:10.879
than anyone else, the translation committee saw the subtlety in Galatians 6.1.

00:06:12.319 --> 00:06:18.720
Well, now, we have a man walking along. He takes a false step. What can happen when you take a false

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:29.120
step? You may dislocate a bone, and that brings us to the word readjust. He says, try to readjust

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:35.920
such a man. Now, you probably know that the word is a medical term for setting a fractured

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:41.120
bone in place. So it works really well with the metaphor, doesn't it? For walking along,

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:46.720
you take a false step, something gets out of joint, and now you have to be readjusted,

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:54.079
the bone has to be set in place. And now we come to what Brother Divine was talking about,

00:06:54.079 --> 00:07:00.879
in a spirit of mildness. And that's good advice, because sometimes the elders are called upon

00:07:00.879 --> 00:07:08.720
to counsel someone who has done something that they find disgusting, and their emotions could

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:14.879
get involved. They may feel like giving the person a good tongue lashing, but they don't.

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:19.600
They pray for Holy Spirit, and what's one of the aspects of the Holy Spirit?

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:28.399
Mildness. They pray for a spirit of mildness. After all, if the person did something that bad,

00:07:28.399 --> 00:07:33.360
he's probably thoroughly ashamed of himself, and it may have taken every ounce of courage that

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:39.759
that person has just to come to the elders. So we deal with the person in kindness.

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:47.360
So it says a spirit of mildness, and then the next phrase is, but keep an eye on yourself.

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:56.800
Yourself. Wait a minute. That singular, isn't it? Didn't we say that at the beginning of verse 1,

00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:04.160
Paul addressed his brothers, plural? But now he's addressing each and every person who was called

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:15.040
upon to give counsel, and Paul says, keep an eye on yourself. Now this calls for a self-examination.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.279
I'm sure that many of us feel very similar in each of the comments that was given this morning.

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:27.920
Many of us who have given counsel for years can look back with regret at times,

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:33.360
at times when we should have been more kind, more mild, and giving counsel.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:41.279
And so it's good for us to undertake a self-examination from time to time. How am I coming across

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:48.240
in the counsel that I'm giving to others? By using the singular, Paul is talking to each and

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:57.039
every one of us. If you are an elder, Paul is talking to you. Paul is talking to me, and he's saying

00:08:57.039 --> 00:09:06.960
examine yourself, examine how your counsel is coming across. Final phrase. For fear, you too may be

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:13.600
tempted. Now what does Paul mean by that? Is he saying that if you hear the details of what

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:20.799
the person has done, you may want to do the same thing? No. What he's reminding of us of is that

00:09:20.799 --> 00:09:28.080
we are all imperfect. Paul is saying to us, don't get on your high horse. Don't be self-righteous

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:34.000
when you're giving counsel to others. Remember, you are imperfect. And one day, you could be sitting

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:39.679
on the other side of the table and receiving counsel. And if that were the case, how would you like

00:09:39.679 --> 00:09:47.440
to be treated in a spirit of mildness? Keeping our own limitations in mind will help us to moderate our

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:56.879
tone to speak to the offender in a spirit of mildness. So let's reread Galatians 6-1. Brothers,

00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:08.159
even if a man takes a false step before he is aware of it, you who have spiritual qualifications

00:10:08.159 --> 00:10:20.559
try to readjust such a man in a spirit of mildness. But keep an eye on yourself for fear you too

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:28.320
may be tempted. Well, what can we take away from this brief discussion? If we can just remember

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:35.759
that counsel must be given in mildness by those who are moved by Holy Spirit, this discussion will

00:10:35.759 --> 00:10:42.960
have been worth having.
