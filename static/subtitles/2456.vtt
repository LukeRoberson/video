00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:08.589
If you look at today's text, let him that thinks he is standing beware that he doesn't not fall.

00:00:08.589 --> 00:00:14.589
What is that especially warning against? Is it not overconfidence?

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:21.589
What could cause a pilot to neglect to carefully follow his safety checklist before takeoff?

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:28.589
Again, overconfidence. What could cause a Christian to fail to regularly check the depth of his spirituality?

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:37.590
Again, overconfidence. So, this being said, let's discuss the theme, never become overconfident.

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:45.590
Now, even though there's no age restriction, especially young ones need to beware of the snare of overconfidence.

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:57.590
Now, you can see this tendency of younger ones to be overconfident in how some of them will recklessly maneuver a motorcycle at very high speed through heavy traffic.

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:06.590
Feeling they're invincible. You can almost tell how old you are about how fast they go through the traffic there.

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.590
Open up please to Proverbs chapter 14.

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:24.590
And even though this scripture doesn't put any age restriction, the point being made that nobody can overconfidently think he's immune to overconfidence.

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:35.030
Now, you have to think about that statement. Look at Proverbs 14, but young ones especially have to beware, but there's no age restriction here.

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:50.030
Verse 16, though wise one is cautious and turns away from evil, but the stupid one is reckless and overconfident.

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:57.030
So, obviously, we don't want to be in the camp of the stupid one, do we? That one is reckless and overconfident.

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:06.030
We want to be cautious and turn away from evil. Now, using this scripture as a foundation for our discussion, what are some cautions?

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:14.030
Because, you know, it says the wise one is cautious. What are some cautions that can help us from being, or keep us from being overconfident?

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:26.030
Well, let's quickly discuss three. One, never overconfidently think we can take unauthorized liberties. Now, let's just talk about this for a moment.

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:38.030
Now, here's two contrasting examples. Think of Aza. Now, no one knows to touch the arc of the covenant, but he reached out and grabbed whole of it, didn't he?

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:59.030
Well, Jehovah struck him dead for this unauthorized liberty that he took. In contrast, think about David. Now, David, even though he had a perfect opportunity to kill Saul, his men were encouraging him to do it, he refused to touch the anointed of Jehovah.

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:09.030
He even felt bad that he had disrespectfully touched the garments of the anointed of Jehovah. So, he knew he had not been authorized to kill Saul.

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:25.030
So, he stayed in his place, he waited on Jehovah. And what a fine example for us. And I'm sure we can all think of in regard to this first caution, we can think of application for here at Bethel and our congregation, even in our family.

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:35.030
Let's get our second caution. Never overconfidently presume on Jehovah's mercy. Now, let's think about this.

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:51.030
An example of this could be the ones that think they'll leave the truth for a while. They'll have some fun in this world, they'll enjoy some selfish desires, and then they'll come back later to Jehovah.

00:03:51.030 --> 00:04:07.030
And Jehovah will take them back, Jehovah will forgive them. But now, isn't that very risky? Isn't that a reckless course? In fact, it makes me think of the story of the dog we had on the farm when I was about 11 or 12 years old.

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:17.029
He was a good dog. We loved him. His name was Wheeler. But one night, there was a pack of wild dogs that came through the valley where we lived.

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:27.029
And Wheeler took off with these wild dogs. Now, we couldn't understand it because we took such good care of him. I asked Dad, why? Why would he do that?

00:04:27.029 --> 00:04:35.029
Well, my father said, maybe there's a female in the pack. Maybe he just wants to have fun for a while, but I'm pretty sure he'll come home.

00:04:35.029 --> 00:04:44.029
Well, he did come home about a week later, but he was all chewed up. He had been in a horrible fight with one or more of the other dogs apparently in the pack.

00:04:44.029 --> 00:04:53.029
And he barely made it back to his doghouse. It took him a couple of weeks. He slowly recovered. He never had the same strength that he had previously.

00:04:53.029 --> 00:05:04.029
But now, here's a really sad part of the story. About two years later, another pack of wild dogs came through. And again, he ran off with them. Now, we couldn't believe it.

00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:13.029
This time, he came back even, he was gone longer. And he couldn't even make it back this time to the doghouse. We found him in the next morning in the yard.

00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:24.029
And my brother and I gently carried him to his doghouse and about a day later, he died in that doghouse. Now, we cried. We couldn't believe it.

00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:34.029
Now, he was just a dog. But if you think about that story, some of our young ones really remind you of that dog, Wheeler.

00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:41.029
They're so well cared for by those that love them, especially Jehovah, but they think you're missing out on fun.

00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:48.029
And so they will run with the world for a while, thinking probably in the back of their head, they're going to come back to the truth later.

00:05:48.029 --> 00:06:00.029
But how foolish, how recklessly may none of us even slightly think this way and may we help others, and especially our young ones, to never foolishly reason this way.

00:06:00.029 --> 00:06:10.029
But one more caution, a third, never overconfidently rely on ourselves. Solomon, apparently, that was his downfall.

00:06:10.029 --> 00:06:22.029
He knew he was not to increase the number of horses, increase wives. See, he was not ignorant. He knew, but somehow he must have rationalized. He was an exception.

00:06:22.029 --> 00:06:29.029
See, he was strong enough. He was wise enough. He could handle it. Well, that was the pride before the crash, wasn't it?

00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:40.029
Or what about Peter? Apparently, his downfall. In effect, he said, all the others may have weaknesses in their faith, but not me, Lord. I'll never fail you.

00:06:40.029 --> 00:06:48.029
But this overconfident, self-reliant, I am more faithful than they are attitude, was followed by a terrible crash.

00:06:48.029 --> 00:07:01.029
And that makes us think of Paul's words at 2 Corinthians 12-10, when I am weak, then I am powerful. See, when we're weak, we know we have to depend on Jehovah. That's really when we're the strongest.

00:07:01.029 --> 00:07:10.029
But when we think we're strong, like Peter, that's generally when we're relying on ourselves. And that's when we're the weakest, see.

00:07:10.029 --> 00:07:22.029
In contrast to Peter, Solomon, Jesus, never overconfidently relied on himself. And that's why he never crashed. Look at Luke chapter 22.

00:07:22.029 --> 00:07:37.029
Just one more thought here about right before his betrayal and death. See, notice how he was certainly not relying on himself, even though you could say he had billions of years of faithful service under his belt.

00:07:37.029 --> 00:07:50.029
Verse 41, he withdrew from them about a stone-throw away. He bent his knees and began to pray, saying, Father, if you want to, remove this cup from me.

00:07:50.029 --> 00:08:04.029
Nevertheless, let not my will but yours take place. Then an angel from heaven appeared to him and strengthened him. But he was in such agony that he kept praying more earnestly.

00:08:04.029 --> 00:08:19.029
And his sweat became as drops of blood falling to the ground. Now just recently, I noticed that, and thought about this point, that even after the angel strengthened him, he didn't say, well, I've been strengthened. Now I'm good to go.

00:08:19.029 --> 00:08:28.029
No, he prayed even more intently. Truly the opposite of overconfidence. So there we have three cautions.

00:08:28.029 --> 00:08:42.029
Never overconfidently think we can take unauthorized liberties in Jehovah's organization. Number two, never overconfidently presume on Jehovah's mercy.

00:08:42.029 --> 00:08:57.029
And number three, never overconfidently rely on ourselves. Now if we observe these cautions, we'll never join the camp of the stupid ones who are reckless and overconfident.

00:08:57.029 --> 00:09:04.029
And number three, never overconfidently presume on Jehovah's mercy.
