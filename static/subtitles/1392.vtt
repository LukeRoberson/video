Do not be misled bad associations spoil useful habits

00:00:10.949 --> 00:00:13.949
Okay, but what's good associations?

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.829
Well, we have wholesome gatherings with our brothers and sisters from the congregation

00:00:18.829 --> 00:00:24.589
And we eat and talk and some like to play musical instruments and they'll do

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:43.219
renditions of original songs and we have a really nice time. Yeah, I don't do that. It's not boring

00:00:44.219 --> 00:01:11.950
Sure, it's not. Well, what do you do? Wouldn't do that

00:01:12.709 --> 00:01:14.709
It's not exactly wholesome

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:17.549
But you've got to have fun, right?

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.549
True and

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:21.469
We do

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:24.750
See for yourself. I'm having some people over this weekend

00:01:25.709 --> 00:02:01.469
Why don't you come? It wasn't the club

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:04.269
But it was still fun
