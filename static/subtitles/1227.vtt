00:00:01.139 --> 00:00:09.140
Jehovah, dear Father, there's seen no hope for us.

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:16.140
The ransom has given hope to everyone.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:25.739
We give our lives to you, our best and all we do.

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:29.739
And we'll tell others too,

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:33.740

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:41.740
and now we sing as one.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:46.740
The song will sing forever,

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:56.060

they draw us close to you.

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:06.060

your friendship is we've come to love.

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.060
But something more than this,

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.060
is your most precious gift.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.060
He died then, we might live.

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.060

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:32.189

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.189

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:40.189
The song will sing forever,

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:49.780
forgiving us your precious son.

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.780
