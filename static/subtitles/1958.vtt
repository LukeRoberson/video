00:00:06.059 --> 00:00:10.060
The Bible describes God as the hero of prayer.

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:17.140
He can even hear your silent prayers.

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.140
How is that possible?

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:25.140
The hero of prayer is also the creator of all life.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.140
He understands how the human mind works.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:34.140
He designed it so he can read the thoughts of your mind

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:42.189
and hear your silent prayers.

00:00:42.189 --> 00:00:46.920
Jehovah God is interested in you.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.920
No matter where you live.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:56.000
Whenever language you speak, he understands it.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:07.969
But does he accept and listen to all prayers?

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:11.969
Imagine a manager who sees an employee stealing.

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:16.430
The manager could front him.

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.430
But the employee first lies about his stealing

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.430
and then tries to justify his actions.

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.430
Although the manager hears the employee's lies and excuses,

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.430
he refuses to accept them.

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:35.430
Similarly, God does not accept all prayers.

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.430
For example, what if a person's prayer is selfish?

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:46.409
What if a man mistreats his wife at home?

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.409
And the next day he asks for God's blessings?

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:56.709
What if soldiers pray to God for help to destroy their enemy?

00:01:57.709 --> 00:02:01.709
While the opposing army prays for the same thing?

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:04.709
Will God accept such prayers?

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:08.710
Clearly, God is not pleased with prayers

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:11.710
that conflict with his moral principles.

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:16.710
On the other hand, God eagerly accepts your prayers.

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.710
Even if you have done bad things,

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.710
if you sincerely want to draw close to Him

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.710
and seek His wisdom and forgiveness,

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:32.069
being heard by God is indeed possible

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:35.069
for those who strive to please Him.

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:41.439
Does God really hear your prayers?

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:47.610
What can prayers do for you?

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:53.610
