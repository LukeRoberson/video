00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:11.939
The Prophet Isaiah foretolded that in the final part of the days, people of all nations would flock to Jehovah's elevated place of pure worship.

00:00:11.939 --> 00:00:17.940
They would say, Jehovah will instruct us about his ways and we will walk in his paths.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.940
Well, how happy we are to see this prophecy undergoing fulfillment right before our eyes.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:30.940
The result is multicultural and multilingual, united worshipers giving praise to Jehovah.

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:37.939
This morning we want to share with you proof of this as we experienced on our recent branch visit.

00:00:37.939 --> 00:00:50.939
It was truly a pleasure for Terry and myself to be teamed up with Robert and Faith Lucioni for the branch visit to three countries in Asia, from March 29th through April 19th, 2016.

00:00:50.939 --> 00:00:59.939
Our first stop was with Japan. The 214,000 publishers in Japan are very active in the ministry.

00:00:59.939 --> 00:01:08.939
With over 65,000 regular pioneers, they maintain one of the highest ratios of pioneers to publishers.

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:18.939
The branch facilities in Japan are surrounded by beautiful gardens and water features, which certainly bring honor to Jehovah's name.

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:28.939
We also enjoy the tour of the printer. Their presses print magazines, brochures, tracks, and books for the entire Asia region.

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:37.939
When it comes to Bible printing, they team up with the United States printer to print all the New World Translation Bibles for the whole world.

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:48.939
The Bindry in Japan has produced over 8,500,000 deluxe Bibles in 45 languages since the release of the revised New World Translation.

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:56.939
With the reduction in personnel in the Bethel family, a number of sisters are making adjustments to new assignments, which were formerly handled by brothers.

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:02.939
It was very commendable to note how these sisters make an excellent contribution to the work.

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:09.939
The translation department cares for the Japanese language and the Japanese sign language translations.

00:02:09.939 --> 00:02:13.939
On Monday, we enjoyed a special noon meal with the family.

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:21.939
One truly special feature was the song sung by the translators and missionaries who joined the branch visit from Bangladesh.

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:27.939
What a beautiful group of loyal, hardworking brothers and sisters.

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:33.939
Along with Aluceonis, we also enjoyed field service with a local congregation.

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:39.939
Over the years, the brothers and sisters in Japan have set such a good example in their zeal for Kingdom Preaching.

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:43.939
They continue to find great joy in their ministry.

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:50.740
On Saturday, we enjoyed a special program at the Abena Assembly Hall.

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:56.740
The program was also streamed to Kingdom Halls throughout Japan, Bangladesh, and Mongolia.

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:01.740
The total attendance was 226,000.

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:08.740
Everyone enjoyed a fine interchange of encouragement from the program and the association.

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:13.740
Well, the time had come for us to move from Japan to Mongolia.

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:21.740
Mongolia is landlocked between Russia and China and is one of the most sparsely populated countries in the world.

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:29.740
The landscape of Mongolia consists of rivers, streams, towering mountains, and rolling grasslands.

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:33.740
Buddhism maintains a strong foothold in Mongolia today.

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:40.740
Interestingly, it wasn't until the 1990s that the good news began to be preached in this land.

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:46.740
In fact, the first Mongolian publishers were baptized in 1996.

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:53.740
There are now over 458 publishers who are currently conducting over 800 Bible studies.

00:03:53.740 --> 00:04:00.740
The 15 members of the Bethel family make up this remote translation office or RTO.

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:05.590
They are located in this five-story building.

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.590
On our visit, it was our pleasure to meet Botrk and his wife.

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:16.589
They are both deaf and learn the truth in the mid-90s while attending college in St. Petersburg, Russia.

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:23.589
After college, they returned to Mongolia only to find there were no publishers in the country.

00:04:23.589 --> 00:04:27.589
So, their baptism was held at a convention in Russia.

00:04:27.589 --> 00:04:33.589
They became the first native Mongolians to serve in Mongolia.

00:04:33.589 --> 00:04:40.589
Brother Bacetic now serves as a congregation elder in the Yulimbataar Sign Language Congregation.

00:04:40.589 --> 00:04:46.589
It was very encouraging to visit with Sister Naryantoya, who works with the translation department.

00:04:46.589 --> 00:04:53.589
She related how she came into the truth through her husband, who also worked in the translation department before he passed away.

00:04:53.589 --> 00:04:57.589
However, his translation work did not begin there.

00:04:57.589 --> 00:05:00.589
Brother Olyan Botrk was a doctor.

00:05:00.589 --> 00:05:05.589
Prior to learning the truth, he went to Poland alone to make money for his family.

00:05:05.589 --> 00:05:10.589
When he was there, he met Jehovah's Witnesses and studied the knowledge book.

00:05:10.589 --> 00:05:15.589
He was so impressed with what he learned that he wanted to share the truth with his family.

00:05:15.589 --> 00:05:22.589
But there was no knowledge book in Mongolian back then, so he translated the book himself.

00:05:22.589 --> 00:05:28.589
One chapter a week and sent them as a form of handwritten letters to his family in Mongolia.

00:05:28.589 --> 00:05:33.589
Our dear brother did this for his family, out of love for them.

00:05:33.589 --> 00:05:39.589
As a result, his wife and children, as well as a relative's family, came into the truth.

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:49.589
In December 1997, he returned to Mongolia to help his family spiritually, even though he had hoped to stay in Europe until the next summer to get baptized.

00:05:49.589 --> 00:05:53.589
He was finally baptized in May 1998.

00:05:53.589 --> 00:06:02.589
In 1999, he officially became a translator, and the Mongolian knowledge book was officially released in 2001.

00:06:02.589 --> 00:06:11.899
Along with the Lucionis, we visited Sister Setske, who lives in a traditional Mongolian gear or yurt.

00:06:11.899 --> 00:06:18.899
Sister Setske has been paralyzed and bedridden for 15 years due to tumors.

00:06:18.899 --> 00:06:26.899
She recently learned the truth and was baptized in July 2015, as she cannot leave her yurt.

00:06:26.899 --> 00:06:32.899
But she attends meetings regularly on the phone and makes well-prepared comments.

00:06:32.899 --> 00:06:38.899
Because she is bedridden, she does all she can to informally witness to any visitors.

00:06:38.899 --> 00:06:46.899
Twice a week, she conducts Bible studies with her grandchildren, and at the same time cares for her family worship.

00:06:46.899 --> 00:06:53.899
Sadly, the time came for us to leave this beautiful, happy family whom we fell in love with.

00:06:53.899 --> 00:06:59.899
From Mongolia, we traveled to Nepal, a land of majestic mountains.

00:06:59.899 --> 00:07:04.899
The majority of its 20 million inhabitants are Hindus.

00:07:04.899 --> 00:07:08.899
There is, however, a great diversity in the ethnic origins of the people.

00:07:08.899 --> 00:07:12.899
The truth began to be cultivated in the 1970s.

00:07:12.899 --> 00:07:17.899
There are now 2,362 publishers.

00:07:17.899 --> 00:07:24.899
The brothers and sisters are working hard in the ministry, conducting about 4,500 Bible studies.

00:07:25.899 --> 00:07:32.899
This has been resulting in bringing in approximately 150 newly baptized ones each year.

00:07:32.899 --> 00:07:38.899
After a short ride from the airport, we arrived at the country office, located in the heart of Kathmandu.

00:07:38.899 --> 00:07:43.899
30 members of the Bethel family live and work in six rented buildings.

00:07:43.899 --> 00:07:50.899
While the buildings are in the vicinity of each other, it is not an efficient arrangement, either work-wise or financially.

00:07:50.899 --> 00:08:00.899
So it was thrilling for the family to learn that just a week before our arrival, they had closed on the purchase of a five-story office building.

00:08:00.899 --> 00:08:07.379
On Monday, Brother Lucioni and I took the opportunity to visit the new site.

00:08:07.379 --> 00:08:17.379
The lower floors will comfortably accommodate the translation department, audio recording, the service department, as well as the Bethel office.

00:08:17.379 --> 00:08:23.379
This then allows for enough space for all the residence rooms for the upper floors.

00:08:23.379 --> 00:08:27.379
A key role for this country office is the translation work.

00:08:27.379 --> 00:08:35.379
Here at the meeting with the translation and audio video departments, it was so encouraging to see their zeal for their work.

00:08:35.379 --> 00:08:43.379
Meet Brother Hero Moharajan, who is deaf and commutes to Bethel twice a week to assist with the sign language translation.

00:08:44.379 --> 00:08:51.379
During the earthquake last year, his home, where he lived with his family, was completely destroyed.

00:08:51.379 --> 00:08:57.379
Following the earthquake, it was doubtful if he could continue commuting to Bethel and supporting the translation work.

00:08:57.379 --> 00:09:00.379
How are such ones ferry now?

00:09:00.379 --> 00:09:07.379
A tremendous amount of relief work was carried out by the Disaster Relief Committee, or DRC.

00:09:07.379 --> 00:09:15.379
This included building homes for about 90 families, as seen in the photos of the buildings with the blue roofs.

00:09:15.379 --> 00:09:27.379
As a result of the DRC construction, Brother Hero now has a new home, and has resumed commuting to Bethel twice a week, working around his secular work schedule.

00:09:27.379 --> 00:09:38.379
Despite the earthquake and all the disruption that it brought, the brothers and sisters never lost their focus on the ministry and the need to bring comfort to the neighbors.

00:09:38.379 --> 00:09:44.230
They just love talking about the wonderful good news.

00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:54.230
On Saturday, April 16th, brothers and sisters from Kathmandu began filling into the city's Academy Hall for the special meeting for congregations.

00:09:54.230 --> 00:10:02.230
In addition to the 13 congregations that were invited to the venue, 30 congregations throughout Nepal were tied in.

00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:06.230
The total attendance was 3,137.

00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:12.230
Indeed, all praise goes to Jehovah for drawing the sheep like ones to him.

00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:23.230
Whether they live in Nepal, Mongolia, or Japan, or any other part of the world, Jehovah is not partial, and he brings them into his beautiful organization,

00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:26.230
that is truly united.

00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:31.230
We are so thankful and proud to be with his people.

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:38.639
Yes, people of all nations are flocking to Jehovah's mountain of true worship.

00:10:38.639 --> 00:10:44.639
Of course, Jehovah deserves the credit for elevating pure worship in this time.

00:10:44.639 --> 00:10:53.639
Still, as fellow workers we are privileged to share in this work, sharing in this work with our brothers and sisters from every part of the earth.

00:10:53.639 --> 00:11:01.639
How marvelous it will be when this entire globe is filled only with pure worshipers of Jehovah.
