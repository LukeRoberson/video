00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:12.490
In recent years, the annual meeting has been an occasion where clarified understanding of Bible truths a new light has been announced and explained.

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:23.489
Of course, it's not at every annual meeting that this takes place, but when Jehovah makes something known, often it's at the annual meeting where it is announced.

00:00:24.489 --> 00:00:37.829
Will there be new light today? I think Brother Cook already spilled the beans a bit, but we look forward to see what is in store for our program.

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:48.829
But how do you ever wonder, though, how exactly does Jehovah reveal clarified understanding of the Scripture's new light in modern times?

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:59.829
When the governing body is meeting together, as the faithful and discreet slave, how does it work? How exactly does the light get brighter?

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:05.829
How does Jehovah use that arrangement to clarify our understanding?

00:01:05.829 --> 00:01:12.829
Well, first of all, what do we know from the Scriptures? Let's look at four points.

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:19.829
The first one is this, by what means does Jehovah reveal new light?

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:30.000
Well, for that we can turn to 1 Corinthians 2 and read together 1 Corinthians 2 verse 10.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:43.239
For it is to us, God has revealed them through His Spirit, for the Spirit searches into all things, even the deep things of God.

00:01:44.239 --> 00:01:55.239
So clearly, by what means does Jehovah reveal new light? It's by His Spirit. We recognize the key role that Jehovah's Spirit has in revealing the truth.

00:01:55.239 --> 00:02:01.239
0.2, to whom does Jehovah reveal clarified understanding?

00:02:02.239 --> 00:02:13.819
Well, for that we can turn to the book of Matthew, chapter 24, and read together Matthew 24 verse 45,

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:23.819
who really is the faithful and discreet slave whom His master appointed over His domestics to give them their food at the proper time?

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:35.819
So clearly, Christ has appointed the faithful and discreet slave, and it is through this channel that Jehovah through Christ works to provide spiritual food.

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:49.819
So just with those two first points, it's very clear to us how spiritual truth, new understanding, is communicated from heaven to earth by means of the Holy Spirit through the channel of the faithful and discreet slave.

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:55.819
Question number three, when does Jehovah reveal new light?

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:07.819
Well, we just have to look back to verse 45, Matthew 24, the slave will provide the food at the proper time. There's a clear timing element indicated there isn't there.

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:16.819
And so, Jehovah reveals clarified understanding at His time when it is needed and when it will help us to carry out His will.

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:29.199
Number four, at what rate does He reveal new light? Is it all at once like a dump truck or is it metered out like a trickle?

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:37.930
Well, the answer to that is found in the book of Proverbs, chapter 4, in verse 18.

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:49.780
Proverbs 4, 18, with the path of the righteous is like the bright morning light that grows brighter and brighter until full daylight.

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:55.780
So the Bible here uses the illustration of daylight and what does that teach us?

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:04.780
Well, the watchtower said, these words aptly apply to the way in which Jehovah reveals His purpose to His people gradually.

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:16.779
So just as daylight grows brighter and brighter gradually, a proper understanding of Bible truths comes gradually as we need it and as we are able to absorb it and use it.

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:27.779
And we appreciate that, don't we? It's easier on our eyes when literal light gets brighter gradually and so it is with understanding of Jehovah's purpose as well.

00:04:27.779 --> 00:04:37.779
For example, think about Abraham. Could Abraham have handled and absorbed a complete understanding of Jehovah's will at His time?

00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:50.779
How he would use the 12 tribes of Israel, the Mosaic law, the understanding of Christ and the payment of the ransom, and the first century Christian congregation, the heavenly hope, the last days, details about the great tribulation?

00:04:50.779 --> 00:05:01.779
No way, he couldn't handle all of that. He didn't need it. But Abraham had what he needed to serve Jehovah acceptably during the time that he lived.

00:05:01.779 --> 00:05:09.779
Well, we have the privilege to live during the last days where true knowledge was foretold to become abundant.

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:19.779
But even still, it is released and made known at a pace that we can absorb, that we can handle, and that we can use, and we thank Jehovah for that.

00:05:19.779 --> 00:05:29.220
So this is what we know from the scriptures and from our own experience as well about how the light gets brighter in modern times.

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:40.220
It comes about by means of the Holy Spirit through his channel of the faithful and discreet slave. He reveals it gradually and at a time that it is needed.

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:50.220
Well, knowing this, then we are not embarrassed about adjustments that are made nor do is an apology needed for not getting it exactly right previously.

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:57.220
We understand this is how Jehovah operates. He reveals matters gradually when it is needed.

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:08.220
And also, the governing body is neither inspired nor infallible. And so it can air in doctrinal matters or in organizational direction.

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:17.220
The brothers do the best they can with what they have and what they understand at the time, but are happy if Jehovah sees fit to clarify matters.

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:27.220
And then that can be shared with the brotherhood. And when that happens, we understand this because it is Jehovah's time for that to happen, and we eagerly accept that.

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:35.790
But now back to our original question, okay, we understand these things from the scriptures, but really how does it work?

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:42.790
When the brothers are meeting together, how does Jehovah help them come to a better understanding of things?

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:50.790
Well, that is an appropriate question because Jehovah does not intend for it to be a mystery or overly secretive.

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:59.790
In fact, in his inspired scriptures, he reveals examples of when understanding was clarified in the Christian era.

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:16.790
And a notable example is around 49 CE when clarification was needed regarding the requirements for salvation. And specifically, the question was, would Gentile males first need to be circumcised and submit to the mosaic law in order to be saved?

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:27.790
This was a significant matter that could have divided the congregation, and so it was referred to the apostles and the older men, the governing body at that time.

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:36.790
And in fact, at Galatians 2.2, Paul states that as a result of a revelation, he brought the matter to the brothers in Jerusalem.

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:43.790
So Christ himself directed that this important doctrinal matter be settled by the brothers taking the lead.

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:55.790
And in Acts 15, Jehovah allows us to look in on that meeting, to be a fly on the wall as it were, to hear their discussion, to see how the Holy Spirit worked with them,

00:07:55.790 --> 00:08:04.790
how they used God's word, how they came to a conclusion, and then the result that was sent and conveyed to the congregations.

00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:08.790
And the process is not entirely different today.

00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:23.600
So let's take a look at what happened. If we turn together to Acts chapter 15, in beginning in verse 6, it says, the apostles and the elders gather together to look into this matter.

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:28.600
So this is an important matter. It's brought before the governing body of that day.

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:34.600
And then in verse 7, it mentions that there is much intense discussion.

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:45.600
So a lively conversation, the brothers felt free to express themselves respectfully, but they were sharing their thoughts and opinions about the different sides of the issue.

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:52.600
And in verse 7, Peter stands. And maybe this is the point that is reflected in our artwork here.

00:08:52.600 --> 00:09:00.600
And Peter begins to speak and relates his comments based on his real life experience with Cornelius.

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:03.600
So they're considering some facts.

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:10.600
And if you look at verse 12, Peter's words strike a chord because the entire group becomes silent.

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:13.600
And in this we see humility, don't we?

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:18.600
Because none of the brothers were trying to force their personal opinion or get their idea approved.

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:24.600
They were collectively looking to Jehovah for direction on the matter.

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:33.600
Well, this makes way, then, for Paul and Barnabas to begin to explain their experiences, so more facts, more evidence that they could consider.

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:36.600
And then in verse 13, James speaks up.

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:42.600
And he uses the scriptures to help the brothers draw a proper scriptural conclusion.

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:52.600
He applies Amos 9-11 and 12 saying that Jehovah would turn his attention to the nations to take out of them a people for his name.

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:57.600
So verses 19 through 21, he recommends a decision.

00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:01.600
Verse 25 indicates that that decision was unanimous.

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:10.600
And then in verse 22, it mentions that they send the brothers out to inform the congregation of this clarified understanding.

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:18.600
So the whole process described there, we see the use of God's word, we see the leadership of the Christ, the operation of the Holy Spirit,

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:22.600
working through the brothers, taking the lead at that time.

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:29.600
And so we can see it's the process is not intended to be a mystery or to be overly secretive.

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:35.600
And the process today is not much dissimilar than that.

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:38.600
In 2010, the wash tower explained it this way.

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:43.600
It said, when the time comes to clarify a spiritual matter in our day,

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:51.600
Holy Spirit helps the faithful and discreet slave to discern deep truths that were not previously understood.

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:56.600
The governing body as a whole considers adjusted explanations.

00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:01.600
What they learn, they publish for the benefit of all end quote.

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:05.600
So generally, the process happens this way.

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:08.600
First of all, a question comes up.

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:17.600
And so it could be that a governing body member in his personal study or his personal Bible reading notices something that then raises the question.

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:26.600
Or it could be that a question comes up during the preparation or translation of spiritual food that requires more consideration.

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:32.600
World events might put the spotlight on a particular prophecy that then gets closer attention.

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:35.600
So in one way or another, a question comes up.

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:40.600
And that question is then put on the governing body's agenda for discussion.

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:48.600
And the question is, does this require or warrant additional research?

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:56.600
The brothers are not making a final decision on what the new understanding will be just asking, does it warrant additional research?

00:11:56.600 --> 00:12:05.600
And if the answer is yes, then a research team is assigned to provide recommendations and research for the governing body to consider.

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:13.600
And this research includes a summary of everything that we have said, the organization has said on the subject since 1879.

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:16.600
All the watchtowers, what have we said?

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:22.600
Also, it includes what the context of the verse indicates about its meaning, meaning.

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:30.600
Or what bearing do parallel accounts have on the understanding of the account, if there are any parallel accounts?

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:37.600
And finally, what impact does the original Hebrew or Greek have on our understanding of the verse?

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:45.600
Well, once that whole research package is compiled, it's placed back on the governing body's agenda for review.

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:54.600
And of course, once it goes on the agenda, then each individual member of the governing body, under prayer, reviews the information and thinks about it in preparation for the meeting.

00:12:54.600 --> 00:13:03.600
And then is discussed as a group at the governing body meeting, again, under prayer, relying on Jehovah's Holy Spirit.

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:09.600
And when this matter has discussed, the discussion is not rushed, nor is the decision forced.

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:19.600
But often, like in the first century, it's a lively discussion as the brothers feel free to share their opinions and their thoughts, the results of their meditation and their research.

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:22.600
But there's also humility there.

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:34.600
Because again, none of the brothers are trying to force their idea or try to get their thoughts approved, but there is this collective unified desire to see Jehovah's direction on the matter.

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:37.600
And where is he steering things?

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:41.600
The goal is to discern Jehovah's direction on the matter.

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:49.600
And often, or at times, we could say, the final result might be quite different than what the research package originally recommended.

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:55.600
But that's Jehovah's Spirit working through the faithful and discrete slave to bring us to the right decision.

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:59.600
And the brothers are looking for a unanimous decision.

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:08.600
The times it may seem like this is a solid adjustment, but if it's not unanimous, it just might not be time yet for it to be revealed.

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:11.600
So it's not forced, the matter is set aside.

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:18.600
And it could be that sometime later, even some years later, the matter comes back up and then it sails right through.

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:26.600
Or maybe it does get approved, but now with a couple of key points discern that weren't discerned earlier.

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:39.580
If this thorough process, under prayer, and when there is unanimous accord, then the brothers take that as Jehovah's direction and then are happy to share it with the brotherhood.

00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:48.580
So this helps us to understand the process, understand how light gets brighter in modern times.

00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:53.580
While it is interesting to us, how are understanding is clarified?

00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:58.580
What really touches our heart is why it's clarified.

00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:02.580
Turn with me, please, to the book of Amos, chapter 3.

00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:09.230
And notice what Amos 3 7 says.

00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:21.409
For the sovereign Lord Jehovah will not do a thing unless he has revealed his confidential matter to his servants, the prophets.

00:15:21.409 --> 00:15:25.409
Doesn't that convey Jehovah's confidence in us?

00:15:25.409 --> 00:15:29.409
Doesn't it indicate his love, his loyalty?

00:15:29.409 --> 00:15:36.409
Jehovah is actively involved in teaching his people, preparing us for what lies ahead.

00:15:36.409 --> 00:15:41.409
He's providing us with the understanding that we need when we need it.

00:15:41.409 --> 00:15:44.409
And that is reassuring, isn't it?

00:15:44.409 --> 00:15:53.409
Because as we progress deeper into the time of the end, as Satan's hatred intensifies and his attacks increase.

00:15:53.409 --> 00:16:09.409
As we draw closer to the great tribulation and the destruction of Satan's wicked system of things, we can be confident that Jehovah God, our God, will continue to loyally provide us with the direction and the understanding that we need.

00:16:09.409 --> 00:16:14.409
We will not be left without guidance, unsure where to go or what to do.

00:16:14.409 --> 00:16:19.409
We will not be left to stumble in the dark because Jehovah has said,

00:16:19.409 --> 00:16:27.409
the path of the righteous one is light, the bright morning light that grows brighter and brighter until full daylight.
