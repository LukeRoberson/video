WEBVTT

00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:09.650
Now, we often talk about endurance, but here's a question, is endurance unique to Jehovah's

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:10.650
people?

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.150
No.

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.650
Everybody has to endure things.

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:20.190
We think people have to endure death and sickness and disasters and violence and pandemics,

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:23.329
food shortages, and much more.

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:29.129
Why even being persecuted for our faith does not set us apart from other people in the

00:00:29.129 --> 00:00:30.129
world.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.129
Think about it.

00:00:31.129 --> 00:00:36.850
Others have to deal with persecution for their religion, their ethnic background, even

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:38.450
the color of their skin.

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:47.570
Yes, due to imperfection and this wicked world we live in, everybody has to endure something.

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.609
But Jesus highlighted, though, something that sets our endurance apart from others, and

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:53.929
it's in our text for today.

00:00:54.009 --> 00:00:59.329
And if I had you to turn to Luke chapter 8 and verse 15, let's read it again.

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:06.530
Luke 8, 15, it says, as for that on the fine soil, these are the ones who after hearing

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:13.769
the word with a fine and good heart, retain it and bear fruit with endurance.

00:01:13.769 --> 00:01:17.890
Do you notice what separates us apart from others in the world?

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:19.209
Us as an organization.

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:26.890
See, we hear the word of God, we retain it, we endure, but we bear fruit while we endure.

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.569
Now what is the fruitage we bear while we are enduring?

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:34.849
Well, the context of this scripture is talking about, and as our comments mention, talking

00:01:34.849 --> 00:01:39.129
about preaching, preaching the kingdom message, and we know our brothers and sisters do that

00:01:39.129 --> 00:01:40.849
no matter what they're going through.

00:01:40.849 --> 00:01:46.409
They continue telling others the good news about the kingdom and about Jehovah.

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.569
What's the other fruitage that we bear?

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:52.769
Well, look at Colossians chapter 1 and verse 10.

00:01:52.769 --> 00:02:01.129
Colossians chapter 1 and verse 10 says, so as to walk worthily of Jehovah in order to please

00:02:01.129 --> 00:02:08.650
him fully as you go on bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the accurate knowledge

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:09.650
of God.

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:15.009
Yes, even while going through very difficult times, terrible times, what do our brothers

00:02:15.169 --> 00:02:16.650
and sisters do?

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.330
Well, they continue to do every good work.

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:24.210
They look to see it like in help others, support the kingdom, support the organization, support

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.569
their brothers and sisters.

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:30.129
Then there's also Galatians 5, 22 and 23.

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:34.530
That reminds us that no matter what it is that we're going through, we continue to cultivate

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:40.370
the fruitage of God's spirit, which includes those beautiful qualities of love, joy, peace,

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.169
patience, kindness, goodness, faith, maleness, and self-control.

00:02:45.169 --> 00:02:50.129
See, we endure, but we continue to bear these beautiful qualities.

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:54.969
And really, that's one of the things that sets Jehovah's organization as a people apart

00:02:54.969 --> 00:03:01.210
from the rest of the world, not just endurance, but bearing fruit while enduring.

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:05.930
And isn't it true that that's one of the things that makes us so proud to be part of

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:06.930
this organization?

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.169
Because we look around and we see our brothers and sisters doing that.

00:03:10.169 --> 00:03:13.689
It makes us so proud of them, so proud of each other.

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:19.449
Now as we know, our brothers in Russia are enduring religious persecution yet they keep

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:21.689
on bearing fruit.

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:24.129
Here's a few experiences.

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:30.169
One brother who we will call Ivan was, has been in five different prison cells in the

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:33.930
detention center where he is at at the time of his writing.

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:39.289
And his prayers include asking Jehovah to give him the opportunity to witness on every

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:40.689
occasion.

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:42.169
So what does he do?

00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:44.849
He witnesses on every occasion.

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:50.490
In one transfer, the prison official sent Ivan to a special section that had very harsh

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:51.490
conditions.

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:56.129
It was a section that is set aside for especially dangerous criminals.

00:03:56.129 --> 00:04:01.689
And they put Ivan in a cell with a man accused of terrorism.

00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:05.810
And what Ivan do immediately began to witness to him.

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:09.490
Ivan says that his cellmate turned out to be very interested in the Bible.

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:11.810
They often spoke about the Bible.

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:17.290
Ivan has now been transferred to another cell and is witnessing to those inmates.

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:22.410
But before leaving, he arranged for some brothers to begin corresponding with this man.

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:28.930
And Ivan is hoping that this man continues to correspond and continue studying the Bible.

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:35.810
A sister will call Nadia, was told about the possibility that her prison sentence might

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:38.370
be reduced to house arrest.

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:43.170
Well, Nadia was not as excited as one would naturally imagine.

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:44.170
Why?

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:48.370
Well, it's because Nadia felt that she still had much work to do there in prison.

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:52.769
See, over the six months that she was there, the prison officials had transferred or had

00:04:52.769 --> 00:04:58.850
put 22 different women in her cell with her, and Nadia witnessed all of them.

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:02.089
She conducted Bible studies with five of them.

00:05:02.089 --> 00:05:06.490
Nadia does not see an urgent need to leave the prison quite yet.

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:12.689
So what's the difference between Nadia and Ivan and their fellow inmates?

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:15.569
They're all enduring prison.

00:05:15.569 --> 00:05:18.930
But Ivan and Nadia are bearing fruit while they're enduring.

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:20.290
They're witnessing to others.

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:21.889
They're doing good works.

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:27.490
They're maintaining their joy and other aspects of the fruit of God's spirit.

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:30.769
And of course, Jehovah's spirit is helping them to endure.

00:05:30.769 --> 00:05:36.410
Our brothers and sisters there in Russia, during the search of his home, one brother while

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:39.970
they were searching his home became very, very anxious.

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:44.089
He prayed to Jehovah, he says, Jehovah, please, I do not know what to do.

00:05:44.089 --> 00:05:47.209
Please help me know what to do.

00:05:47.209 --> 00:05:51.370
Right then, the investigator who was leading the investigation was looking at our brother's

00:05:51.370 --> 00:06:00.970
refrigerator, and he read the words expressively and loudly that was on a magnet on his refrigerator.

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:04.290
Do not be anxious for I am your God.

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:09.970
The brother immediately recognized this was an answer to his prayer.

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:14.449
Others of our brothers and sisters are dealing with terrible violence and adversities,

00:06:14.449 --> 00:06:17.209
but they continue bearing fruit.

00:06:17.209 --> 00:06:22.490
Yamileh is a 44-year-old sister in Venezuela.

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:29.129
She has two daughters, 117 years old, 120 years old, where she lives has become a very, very

00:06:29.129 --> 00:06:30.930
dangerous place.

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:34.009
Those who can move away do.

00:06:34.009 --> 00:06:37.410
And Yamileh says it's very hard to keep a positive attitude.

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:41.490
She worries about the safety of her two daughters.

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:46.930
Yamileh tells of seeing people held at gunpoint while their little children look

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:53.410
on of witnessing executions on the street, being caught in gun battles during, while she's

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:58.329
in the ministry, and she says most troubling is hearing the desperate screams at night

00:06:58.329 --> 00:07:01.529
of people pleading for their life.

00:07:01.529 --> 00:07:07.930
She says some mornings after particularly terrifying nights, she feels helpless and frightened

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:12.329
to the point where she can't even bear the thought of going out of the house, going out

00:07:12.329 --> 00:07:13.569
into the ministry.

00:07:13.569 --> 00:07:16.050
But what does she do?

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:18.290
She says, I give myself a good talking to.

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:23.730
I say, Yamileh, you're a regular pioneer, you have to go out and preach the good news.

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:27.769
So she says she goes out and she's always encouraged for doing so.

00:07:27.769 --> 00:07:33.089
Recently, Yamileh called on a woman who cried over and over again about the terrible things

00:07:33.089 --> 00:07:35.129
that were taking place.

00:07:35.129 --> 00:07:40.769
Yamileh says that as I shared the kingdom message with her, I thought, thank you, Jehovah.

00:07:40.769 --> 00:07:45.449
This would be me if I did not know you.

00:07:45.449 --> 00:07:51.610
Abner and Isomar are also a young couple, they're a young couple also from Venezuela.

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:56.769
But due to the crisis at home, they moved to Peru nearly two years ago.

00:07:56.769 --> 00:08:02.649
Now their lives became much more difficult due to the coronavirus pandemic and the national

00:08:02.649 --> 00:08:03.889
lockdown.

00:08:03.889 --> 00:08:09.490
And though they were very careful, they took many precautions, both of them fell ill and

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:12.490
were diagnosed with COVID-19.

00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:18.209
Now they mentioned that they had been diagnosed with COVID-19 only to their families in Venezuela

00:08:18.209 --> 00:08:21.009
and to Jehovah in prayer.

00:08:21.009 --> 00:08:26.370
Just one hour later, a local sister knocked on their door and left the bag of food and

00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:28.290
an encouraging card for them.

00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:33.370
Not even a half an hour later, after that, another sister brought a bag of food and a small

00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:35.450
amount of money for them.

00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:40.450
When they had somewhat recovered, they realized that someone had stolen money from their bank

00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:41.769
account.

00:08:41.769 --> 00:08:45.730
And it was the money that they had set aside for a theocratic purpose.

00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:51.250
Again, they told Jehovah in prayer, but this time they told nobody else.

00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:58.129
Later that same day, they received money from a sister in the exact amount that they lost.

00:08:58.129 --> 00:09:01.929
And despite the many obstacles that they're going through, they continue to put the kingdom

00:09:01.929 --> 00:09:02.929
first.

00:09:02.929 --> 00:09:07.450
In addition to sending money home to their families in Venezuela, they continue as regular

00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:08.450
pioneers.

00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:13.090
They are assisting the Peru branch with the Peruvian sign language work.

00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:14.610
What's the point?

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:19.289
The point is that our brothers and sisters are enduring very, very difficult times all

00:09:19.289 --> 00:09:20.690
around the world.

00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:26.090
And yet what separates them, what separates us from the rest of mankind who are enduring

00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:28.450
similar trials?

00:09:28.450 --> 00:09:30.570
We bear fruit with endurance.

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:31.570
And isn't it true?

00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:36.490
We could stay here all day and here experience after experience of our brothers and sisters

00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:41.250
around the world, including those of you of this family, experiences that you're having

00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:43.529
bearing fruit while enduring.
