00:00:01.389 --> 00:00:07.389
The governing body has always felt a keen responsibility to live up to Jesus' command.

00:00:07.389 --> 00:00:10.390
Feed my lands, shepherd my little sheep.

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:14.390
Today's technology makes the governing body feel like family.

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:21.390
But did the worldwide brotherhood in times past enjoy such a strong bond with the governing body?

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:31.120
Let's go back to January of 1945.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:41.119
Brothers and Orren, friends, set out on a tour of Latin America that ended up with conventions in North America, it took four months.

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:52.119
The purpose was to visit branches already established, to organize new branches, to forward the movement of the kingdom preaching work.

00:00:52.119 --> 00:01:10.120
The service tours often combine supervising operations of the branch, giving talks of conventions, dedicating new facilities, overnight visits to remote missionary homes, followed by evening meetings with a local congregation, all this packed into a few days.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:18.120
They provided instruction on field ministry, how to conduct meetings, but also what was taking place in the worldwide field.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:23.120
And then, they would take time to go out into the field ministry with them.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:31.120
One such visit included a stopover in Guatemala, where they visited a very small congregation of just eight people.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:39.120
Their heart was in the preaching work. I can speak from my own experience that the missionaries were very close to Brother Norr's heart.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:45.120
So, after sending them first to Latin America, he was eager to see the progress.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:50.120
And so, he visited them, and then over the years, he traveled the world.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.120
And he visited as many missionary homes as he possibly could.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:02:04.120
He privately met each missionary personally, to talk over the challenges, to arrange for better accommodations, if needed, to assess the potential for growth,

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:10.120
or even to establish a new branch, or arrange to purchase new property, if needed.

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:16.120
Brother Norr loved the Brotherhood, especially missionaries in branch personnel.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:28.120
And he would take an opportunity of a 15 or 20-minute stopover in a train station or an airport, to give encouragement, or to help them to advance the preaching work.

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:38.520
Brother Norr had deep concern for the welfare of the brothers in the war-torn countries of Europe.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:50.520
Brother Norr and Henshel, they traveled to Britain, France, Switzerland, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Scandinavia in November 1945.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:58.520
Imagine just few months after the war ended, the railroad track was destroyed, bridges were destroyed.

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.520
So, there were no good connections between the cities.

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:07.520
It was not a tourist travel, it was really a hard work.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:24.449
But, even this, they did for loving the brothers and helping and encouraging the brothers in these countries.

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:34.449
After visiting the Friends in War-torn Europe, then brothers Norr and Henshel embarked on a very ambitious and extensive 47,000 mile tour.

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:38.449
They visited some lands where there were fewer, even no witnesses.

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:45.449
If no branch operated in a country they visited, they connected with local congregations in private homes.

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:52.449
They attended their meetings, and they accompanied the local publishers to the homes of interested ones for group meetings.

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:55.449
They often rented venues for public meetings.

00:03:55.449 --> 00:04:00.449
Brothers Norr and Henshel went on the streets to advertise the talk that evening.

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:06.449
Then Brother Norr himself even rode with bicycle parades to advertise his talks.

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:14.449
These meetings attracted hundreds of interested ones, even though in one city, there was a threatening note that was received.

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:19.019
Well, things don't always turn out as planned.

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:24.019
Brother Norr and Brother Henshel had a service tour of countries in Africa.

00:04:24.019 --> 00:04:28.019
One of those was Nigeria, and they were two give talks at two conventions.

00:04:28.019 --> 00:04:33.019
One of those conventions was 400 miles away and involved a road trip.

00:04:33.019 --> 00:04:36.019
So they got off to an early start at 3.30 in the morning.

00:04:36.019 --> 00:04:39.019
On the end of the trip, they started to have car problems.

00:04:39.019 --> 00:04:45.019
Those car problems turned into a ruling 18-hour delay, and they realized they weren't going to make the convention.

00:04:45.019 --> 00:04:48.019
So they decided to go back to the branch in Lagos.

00:04:48.019 --> 00:04:54.019
But the return trip took 24 hours to jungle roads and additional car problems.

00:04:54.019 --> 00:05:01.019
They get back to the branch, they take a very brief rest, and they're on to the next branch.

00:05:01.019 --> 00:05:05.019
Brother Norr loved the brothers, and he enjoyed being with him.

00:05:05.019 --> 00:05:11.019
I remember very well how after his concluding talk, he waved to the brothers.

00:05:11.019 --> 00:05:17.019
And we, in the audience, jug out handkerchiefs and waved back for many minutes.

00:05:17.019 --> 00:05:19.019
But that was not all.

00:05:19.019 --> 00:05:24.019
He and Brother Henshel then went to the railroad station to say farewell to the brothers,

00:05:24.019 --> 00:05:26.019
leaving in special trains.

00:05:26.019 --> 00:05:34.019
They called out Al-Feederzein, a Guterreise, and they stayed there till 10-30 at night doing that.

00:05:34.019 --> 00:05:39.019
They thought not of their comfort, but they thought of the brothers.

00:05:39.019 --> 00:05:48.019
A request to hold a large special meeting in Athens in 1952 was not granted by the authorities because of religious interference.

00:05:48.019 --> 00:05:52.019
But not wanting to miss an opportunity to encourage the Greek brothers.

00:05:52.019 --> 00:05:55.019
Brother Norr came up with an alternate plan.

00:05:55.019 --> 00:06:00.019
He and Brother Henshel would take taxis to the homes of local brothers,

00:06:00.019 --> 00:06:03.019
where they would give a talk for approximately 20 minutes.

00:06:03.019 --> 00:06:08.019
Then they would go on to another home, even though they risk arrest because of meeting together.

00:06:09.019 --> 00:06:13.019
They were able to meet with 905 of our Greek brothers.

00:06:13.019 --> 00:06:17.019
In describing that day, Brother Norr wrote,

00:06:17.019 --> 00:06:21.019
it was one of the most blessed experiences of our lives.

00:06:21.019 --> 00:06:26.019
Brother Franz visited Spain many times, but during the 50s, our work was under ban.

00:06:26.019 --> 00:06:32.019
Brother Franz wanted to encourage the local brothers, but he was especially concerned for their safety.

00:06:32.019 --> 00:06:41.019
On this one event, Brother Franz and his driver decided to park their car near the home of their host, a certain Brother Garcia, who was a mechanic.

00:06:41.019 --> 00:06:47.019
So with the hood of the car open, they asked a neighbor, is there a mechanic in the area?

00:06:47.019 --> 00:06:50.019
Of course, he was referred to Brother Garcia.

00:06:50.019 --> 00:06:54.019
Brother Garcia then looked at the car and said, your car needs to come into my shop.

00:06:54.019 --> 00:06:58.019
That was the opportunity for Brother Franz to meet his local brothers and sisters.

00:06:58.019 --> 00:07:04.019
When it was time to walk to the meeting later that day, Brother Franz decided to wear the beret,

00:07:04.019 --> 00:07:10.019
and a sheepskin coat typical for the area so that he would safely blend in with his brothers.

00:07:10.019 --> 00:07:14.019
Well, these brothers were a very loving and courageous man.

00:07:14.019 --> 00:07:22.019
They worked very hard to keep the brothers and countries under ban fired up with zeal, even risking their own safety.

00:07:22.019 --> 00:07:28.019
Brother Franz actually was arrested while meeting with the brothers in Barcelona, Spain.

00:07:28.019 --> 00:07:33.019
Well, these schedules they kept, they must have been exhausting.

00:07:33.019 --> 00:07:41.019
If a country under ban was on the itinerary, they might pay a visit to government officials to promote legalization of our work.

00:07:41.019 --> 00:07:48.019
Well, in our visit at all of the branches to encourage the brothers, and he talked with the missionaries.

00:07:48.019 --> 00:07:54.019
And in the 1950s, there was much growth, and that proved to be too much for him alone.

00:07:54.019 --> 00:08:02.019
So he decided that it would be appropriate to train some of us brothers so that we could assist in that work.

00:08:02.019 --> 00:08:09.019
And see that the shepherding is done, and that the work in the branches is done in unity.

00:08:09.019 --> 00:08:18.360
On the service tour of Africa in 1963, Brother Henshel attended the convention at Gabbana, Liberia.

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:24.360
Suddenly soldiers invaded the convention. They arrested Brother Henshel and others.

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:31.360
He was mistreated beaten with a rifle but to the point where he thought he was going to die.

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:41.220
But he remained on the scene to encourage and assist the brothers to be faithful to avoid compromise.

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:49.220
And when finally he was released, instead of going home, he completed his assignment to visit other branches

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:55.220
and upon return never acted the part of a hero or a martyr.

00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:59.220
It was just the cost of doing the Lord's business.

00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:05.220
Well, the headquarters represented us wanted the best for delegates to a convention.

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:12.220
Brothers nor Henshel were known to personally inspect venues and even negotiate contracts.

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:24.220
In more recent times, Brother Jarrah's personally visited hotels to make sure that there was a proper standard of comfort and cleanliness he even tested out the beds.

00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:30.220
Brother Nor was well aware of the situation that the brothers were facing in the Soviet Union.

00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:38.529
He wrote many letters in which he called on the brothers to live in harmony under the direction of the organization.

00:09:38.529 --> 00:09:43.529
One such letter fell into the hands of the KGB. They altered it.

00:09:43.529 --> 00:09:49.529
But when Brother Nor was told about it, he drew the brother's attention to the spirit of the letter.

00:09:49.529 --> 00:09:57.529
Because from the spirit of the letter, it would be evident immediately whether it was a letter from the organization or a forged letter.

00:09:57.529 --> 00:10:04.529
This was because the spirit of the organization serves to unite the brothers, not divide them.

00:10:04.529 --> 00:10:13.529
All this attention to the international activity was taking place while simultaneously directing the work and expansion of World Headquarters,

00:10:13.529 --> 00:10:19.529
handling various legal issues, organizing and speaking at conventions throughout the United States,

00:10:19.529 --> 00:10:23.529
Gilead school lectures and graduation, annual meeting programs,

00:10:23.529 --> 00:10:30.529
and all the while taking care of their own spiritual well-being and that of their wife, if married.

00:10:30.529 --> 00:10:36.529
The next few decades would see even greater growth, but greater challenges.
