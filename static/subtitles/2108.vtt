00:00:01.229 --> 00:00:08.630
I had a very good cooperation with Russia, who is a very active member of the OSCE, and

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:14.429
did a lot on behalf of particularly persecuted the Christians throughout the world.

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:21.429
So it seems to me somewhat paradoxical that now there are problems of religious liberty

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:23.429
inside Russia.

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:30.550
I understand that the law used against Jehovah's Witnesses is a law against extremism.

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:37.829
And it's perfectly understandable that Russia for its geopolitical location and its

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.109
struggle against terrorism is conserved about extremism.

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:51.350
However, religious liberty is something fragile, and definitions of extremism may easily

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:57.270
be used against groups who are somewhat unpopular.

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:03.829
And this is normally a test for the quality of religious liberty in one country.

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:12.870
I've been studying Jehovah's Witnesses for 40 years, and a very important point is in

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:19.269
technical terms, they are what historians and sociologists call a peace community.

00:01:19.269 --> 00:01:27.069
They are non-violent and peaceful, and they have never encountered instances of violence.

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:34.189
The only relationship between Jehovah's Witnesses and violence has been victims of violence.

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:38.510
The Nazi regime killed more than 2,000 of them.

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:45.310
And there is a famous story that's so peaceful where the Jehovah's Witnesses, when in concentration

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:53.030
camps, the Nazi use them as barbers, given their answer, razor, because they are the only

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:59.430
inmates who can be trusted not to turn the razor against the Nazi world.

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.150
So, Jehovah's Witnesses are extremely peaceful community.

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:11.430
Now, I know under Russian law, sometimes they are accused of being extremist because

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:18.629
in their literature, it is argued that they are the only true religion, but there are two

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:20.629
comments about this.

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:27.750
Number one, a certain emphatic style is typical of religious literature in general.

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.469
We find this in the Holy Quran of the Muslim.

00:02:31.469 --> 00:02:35.430
We find this in the Old Testament in the Bible.

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:45.509
And the second one is that Jehovah's Witnesses do not advocate that states or governments

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:51.830
should give them a better treatment than to members of any other religion.

00:02:51.830 --> 00:03:00.229
So, I believe calling Jehovah's Witnesses extremist is based on a misreading of what is

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:09.349
the typical literary style of their literature, and the bending or discriminating in any way

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:17.189
against Jehovah's Witnesses will be a mistake, will be dangerous for religious liberty

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:26.469
of many other groups, and will tarnish the image Russia enjoys as a government, and

00:03:26.469 --> 00:03:35.189
the country who does allot in the international fora to advocate religious liberty for persecuted

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:38.229
Christians in many other countries of the world.
