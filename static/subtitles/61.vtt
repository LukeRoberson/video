00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:07.190
Welcome to the June 2019 program of JW Broadcasting.

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:29.280
Earlier this year, 56 students from all over the world

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:33.359
gathered to attend the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead.

00:00:33.359 --> 00:00:36.359
They enjoyed a 20-week course that gifted them

00:00:36.359 --> 00:00:39.719
with an in-depth study of the Bible.

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.560
The aim of Gilead schooling is to help strengthen the faith

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.759
of each of the students so that they in turn

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.920
can strengthen the brothers and their respective assignments.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.960
On March 9th of this year, the graduation program

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:59.640
for the 146th class was held at the Watchtower Educational Center

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.159
in Patterson, New York.

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:04.680
You'll now enjoy faith-straightening talks

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.560
that were delivered during the first part

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.719
of the Gilead graduation program.

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:14.200
Over happy to be here today for this graduation

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:17.959
of the 146th class of Gilead.

00:01:17.959 --> 00:01:20.799
And we welcome all who are tied in with us

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:24.040
at our Bethel complexes in the United States,

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.359
in Canada, in Puerto Rico,

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:29.599
and a number of remote translation offices.

00:01:29.599 --> 00:01:32.560
We especially welcome our Gilead students

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.959
who are about to graduate from this marvelous school.

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:39.959
And we welcome your dear family members and friends

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:44.680
who are joining you on this very, very special day.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.799
You seem excited and you should be.

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:51.359
We're happy, we're very, very happy for you.

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:52.680
Now throughout your schooling,

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.760
you've been asked to draw out principles

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.159
from many different Bible accounts, haven't you?

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.519
With that in mind, here is the theme

00:02:01.519 --> 00:02:04.120
of our introductory comments.

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.960
Do you see the point and remember the purpose?

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.199
We're going to illustrate what we mean

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:13.840
by looking at Luke chapter five

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.199
and verses one through 11.

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:19.840
This is the account where some of Jesus' disciples

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.199
chose to leave everything behind and follow him.

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:25.719
Here's the setting.

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:28.800
Some of Jesus' disciples were fishermen

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.520
who had followed Jesus for a time,

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.759
but then they went back to their fishing business.

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:37.120
Jesus sought to reach their hearts

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.960
and move them to follow him fully.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.960
So what did he do?

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.520
He used a powerful object lesson

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.479
that provided a point and a purpose.

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:50.919
Let's read it at Luke chapter one

00:02:50.919 --> 00:02:55.560
or five rather, verse one through verse 11.

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.919
And look for the point, first of all,

00:02:57.919 --> 00:03:00.080
behind what Jesus did here.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:05.479
It says on one occasion when the crowd was pressing in on him

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.960
and listening to the word of God.

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.840
He was standing by the lake of Ganesirat,

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.000
and he saw two boats docked at the lakeside,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.759
but the fishermen had got out of them

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:18.240
and were washing off their nets.

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.199
Going aboard one of the boats, which was Simon's,

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:24.039
he asked him to pull away a bit from land.

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:27.800
Then he sat down and he began teaching the crowds

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.280
from the boat.

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.159
When he stopped speaking, he said to Simon,

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:33.919
pull out to wear it as deep

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:37.000
and let down your nets for a catch.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.120
But in reply, Simon said,

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.759
instructor, we toiled all night and caught nothing.

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:45.599
But at your word, I will lower the nets.

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:47.400
Well, when they did this,

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.319
they caught a great number of fish.

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:52.840
In fact, their nets began ripping apart.

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.560
So the emotion to their partners

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.599
and the other boat to come into system,

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:58.840
and they came and filled both boats

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.560
so that these began to sink.

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.599
Seeing this, Simon Peter fell down at the knees

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:07.520
of Jesus saying, to part from me, Lord,

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.159
because I'm a sinful man.

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:13.159
For both he and those with whom were overwhelmed

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:16.959
with astonishment at the catch of fish, they had taken.

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.040
Man, the same was true of both James and John,

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.480
Zebedee's sons, who were partners with Simon.

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:27.360
But Jesus said to Simon, stop being afraid.

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.120
From now on, you will be catching men alive.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.560
So they brought the boats back to land

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.680
and abandoned everything and followed him.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000
So what was the point behind this miracle here?

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:46.160
What was this?

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.839
Their needs would be cared for

00:04:48.839 --> 00:04:52.839
if they trusted in Jesus and followed him.

00:04:52.839 --> 00:04:56.600
Of course, to do this, they had to believe Jesus, didn't they?

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:57.639
They had to listen to him.

00:04:57.639 --> 00:04:59.639
This was not a trick.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.160
With their own eyes, they could see that catch of fish

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.160
and then deduce that their needs would, in fact,

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.959
be cared for by Jesus.

00:05:07.959 --> 00:05:09.759
That was the point.

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:11.160
Did they get it?

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.439
Yes, they did, with what result?

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:17.000
Well, it says they were moved to abandon everything

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.319
and follow Jesus.

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:21.720
That is, everything related to the fishing business.

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:25.079
They gave it all up and followed him.

00:05:25.079 --> 00:05:29.199
Almost instantly, their faith and trust in Jesus grew,

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:30.839
didn't it?

00:05:30.839 --> 00:05:33.720
Now, let's bring the point up to our day.

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:37.199
Soon, you will go to your assignments.

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:40.680
Will you remember the point of your gilly training?

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.360
Well, what is the point?

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.680
The point has been to build up your faith

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.879
and your trust in Jehovah

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:50.839
and thereby strengthen your relationship with him.

00:05:50.839 --> 00:05:54.360
In turn, as you draw steadily closer to Jehovah,

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.560
you will be ready for whatever work

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:01.519
and whatever responsibility he chooses to place on you.

00:06:01.519 --> 00:06:04.360
Jehovah, by means of his sum, will care for you.

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:08.079
He will help you to faithfully fulfill your assignments

00:06:08.079 --> 00:06:10.399
and you will add to his glory.

00:06:10.399 --> 00:06:13.639
And in all that you do, remember those disciples

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:16.759
who were humble enough to get the point,

00:06:16.759 --> 00:06:20.439
abandon everything and follow Jesus.

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:24.480
Now, for the second part of the question

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:25.639
we mentioned at the beginning,

00:06:25.639 --> 00:06:28.839
what was the purpose behind what Jesus did?

00:06:28.839 --> 00:06:32.639
In other words, Jesus' miracle on that day

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:36.279
carried what deeper meaning for them.

00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:39.000
Well, looking back at Luke chapter five,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.519
what happened when the disciples listened to Jesus,

00:06:42.519 --> 00:06:46.879
went out to where the water was deep and lowered their nets?

00:06:46.879 --> 00:06:49.519
The catch was so great, it says,

00:06:49.519 --> 00:06:53.120
that they filled two boats to the point of sinking.

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.360
The account doesn't say what the disciples did

00:06:55.399 --> 00:06:58.600
with the fish, but they made it to shore.

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:02.879
A man who could walk on water was not going to let them sink.

00:07:02.879 --> 00:07:05.120
Now we get to the greater purpose

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:08.000
behind Jesus' miracle.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.639
Do you recall what Jesus said to the disciples

00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:13.199
after that catch of fish

00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:18.199
and after the disciples became filled with astonishment?

00:07:18.199 --> 00:07:21.839
He told them, stop being afraid.

00:07:21.839 --> 00:07:26.199
From now on, you will be catching men alive.

00:07:26.199 --> 00:07:28.720
You see, by means of that miracle,

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:33.360
Jesus illustrated something greater for them, didn't he?

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:36.000
They would not only be cared for materially,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.439
they got that point, but more importantly,

00:07:39.439 --> 00:07:44.439
they would also become very successful fishers of men.

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:47.120
In other words, the first miracle

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:51.199
pointed to an even greater one yet to come.

00:07:51.199 --> 00:07:54.560
If their large catch was meant to illustrate

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:59.040
how successful they would be as fishers of men,

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:02.319
then they could look back on that catch years later

00:08:02.319 --> 00:08:05.879
and visualize those boats filled with fish

00:08:05.879 --> 00:08:08.879
and be reminded that they had much work yet to do

00:08:08.879 --> 00:08:13.600
in being fishers of men, catching men alive, so to speak,

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:16.399
helping them to become disciples of Christ.

00:08:17.279 --> 00:08:21.959
Your Gilead training will help you to continue supporting

00:08:21.959 --> 00:08:24.560
this vital and never-to-be-repeated work

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:28.639
which is the greater purpose behind your training.

00:08:28.639 --> 00:08:30.279
So then whatever you're given to do

00:08:30.279 --> 00:08:33.519
and wherever your training may take you,

00:08:33.519 --> 00:08:37.879
never forget the point and the purpose behind the blessing

00:08:37.879 --> 00:08:42.039
that you just experienced in being part of this class.

00:08:42.039 --> 00:08:44.519
Trust in Jehovah and in his Son

00:08:44.559 --> 00:08:46.720
to help you at all times

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:49.759
and use your Gilead training to support

00:08:49.759 --> 00:08:51.960
this important work in the branches

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:54.399
and the territories where you will serve.

00:08:55.799 --> 00:08:57.879
Well, we'll say a little bit more about this

00:08:57.879 --> 00:09:01.639
at the conclusion of our program today.

00:09:01.639 --> 00:09:05.600
Now we're going to enjoy a series of very encouraging talks

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:07.600
that will strengthen your faith,

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:11.240
build up your trust, in fact, for all of us listening in,

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:13.879
and highlight God's wonderful purpose

00:09:13.919 --> 00:09:15.840
that we support.

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:19.159
To begin, we're very happy to have with us

00:09:19.159 --> 00:09:21.879
a member of the governing body, Brother David's Plain,

00:09:21.879 --> 00:09:24.399
who is going to present the talk,

00:09:24.399 --> 00:09:43.629
if you look for it, you will find it.

00:09:43.629 --> 00:09:48.149
If you look for it, you will find it.

00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:50.590
Look for what?

00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:55.629
Look for the good in your brothers.

00:09:56.830 --> 00:09:58.070
And when you find it,

00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:01.789
don't be afraid to acknowledge it.

00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:06.230
Now, we all know that we should do that.

00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:09.070
But we do have to fight the tendency to,

00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:11.870
view others a bit critically at times,

00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:14.029
sometimes we question their motives.

00:10:14.950 --> 00:10:19.429
Maybe because we're just a little bit jealous.

00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:23.470
Now think about that, Brother, in your congregation,

00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:25.870
who is just an excellent public speaker.

00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:30.830
When he's scheduled to give a talk, the hall is full.

00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:33.710
And everybody raves about his talks.

00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:37.639
Even your wife.

00:10:37.639 --> 00:10:42.690
Yours, not so much.

00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:46.090
The show off, he doesn't impress me.

00:10:47.289 --> 00:10:48.929
Or what about this?

00:10:48.929 --> 00:10:50.409
You're working in a department

00:10:50.409 --> 00:10:52.850
with one of those annoying people

00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:55.289
who is very efficient.

00:10:56.809 --> 00:10:58.450
He's never late.

00:10:58.450 --> 00:11:00.129
Never misses a day's work.

00:11:01.090 --> 00:11:04.210
He gets a tremendous amount done in a day

00:11:04.210 --> 00:11:08.370
and he almost never makes a mistake.

00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:10.490
Doesn't impress me either.

00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:14.049
Mr. Perfect, he's trying to make the rest of us look bad.

00:11:15.169 --> 00:11:20.090
Well, there we go, questioning someone's motives.

00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:23.009
Now, can we look for the good in Mr. Perfect?

00:11:24.409 --> 00:11:28.090
Can we see, give him a benefit of the doubt?

00:11:29.049 --> 00:11:32.730
Maybe his parents trained him

00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:36.529
to offer the very best gift he could to Jehovah.

00:11:36.529 --> 00:11:39.330
In other words, if he could do more,

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:41.610
he was expected to do more.

00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:45.049
Because he wanted his gift to be the very best gift

00:11:45.049 --> 00:11:46.370
that he could possibly give.

00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:49.169
Now come to think of it, he'd never criticize

00:11:49.169 --> 00:11:51.049
as your gift to Jehovah.

00:11:51.049 --> 00:11:54.649
He just wants to give his very best gift to Jehovah.

00:11:55.610 --> 00:11:58.529
That's the way he approached the pioneer ministry

00:11:58.529 --> 00:12:01.889
and that's the way he approaches his Bethel service.

00:12:01.889 --> 00:12:04.610
So now what do you do with Mr. Perfect?

00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:07.009
Do you tell him to slow down?

00:12:07.009 --> 00:12:08.889
You're making the rest of us look bad?

00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:13.649
Well, if he did that, he'd be giving a substandard gift

00:12:13.649 --> 00:12:18.649
to Jehovah and Jehovah expects and deserves the very best.

00:12:20.009 --> 00:12:21.690
So what do you do?

00:12:21.690 --> 00:12:23.690
You acknowledge his gift.

00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:27.129
You really get a lot done on a day.

00:12:27.129 --> 00:12:28.769
I wish I had your stamina.

00:12:29.769 --> 00:12:33.090
And what about Mr. Showoff, the outstanding speaker?

00:12:34.289 --> 00:12:37.250
Jehovah has given you a wonderful gift.

00:12:37.250 --> 00:12:38.330
You use it well.

00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:40.450
Now was that hard?

00:12:42.009 --> 00:12:44.570
Elders occasionally have to evaluate brothers

00:12:44.570 --> 00:12:46.490
for privileges of service.

00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:48.929
And while we're not blind to the shortcomings

00:12:48.929 --> 00:12:51.409
of our brothers, we try to keep the discussion

00:12:51.409 --> 00:12:53.370
mainly positive.

00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:58.090
Now sometimes we have to discuss a shortcoming, a negative.

00:12:58.090 --> 00:13:01.610
But are we talking about one isolated incident?

00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:02.850
Or is it a pattern?

00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:05.730
It's true that if we make it a habit

00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:07.450
to look on the positive side,

00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:09.690
we'll be disappointed sometimes.

00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:12.970
But it's better to be disappointed occasionally

00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:17.529
than to develop a cynical or resentful attitude

00:13:17.529 --> 00:13:18.850
toward our brothers.

00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:22.090
Let's consider a scriptural example

00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:24.330
where questioning the motives of a brother

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:27.649
could have left a lead to disaster.

00:13:27.649 --> 00:13:30.409
It's in 1 Samuel chapter 17.

00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:34.370
And a little bit of background,

00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:36.210
a little bit of the setting.

00:13:36.210 --> 00:13:40.370
Jesse has sent his youngest son, David,

00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:42.809
to visit his three oldest brothers in the army.

00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:47.169
And Israel is having a face off with the fullistons.

00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:51.529
And when he arrives, David hears Goliath,

00:13:51.529 --> 00:13:53.769
challenged any man of the house of Israel

00:13:53.769 --> 00:13:55.049
to a battle to the death.

00:13:56.169 --> 00:13:58.370
There are no volunteers.

00:13:58.370 --> 00:14:00.970
Now David is a man of faith.

00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:02.409
And he can't believe it.

00:14:02.409 --> 00:14:05.769
He says, who is this uncircumcised forlistened

00:14:05.769 --> 00:14:08.730
that he should taunt the battle lines of the true God?

00:14:09.809 --> 00:14:12.929
Now his oldest brother, Alayab, is listening.

00:14:12.929 --> 00:14:15.730
And we pick up the account in verse 28.

00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:18.169
So that's first Samuel chapter 17,

00:14:18.169 --> 00:14:19.850
and we'll read verse 28.

00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:25.090
When his oldest brother, Alayab, heard him speak to the men,

00:14:25.090 --> 00:14:28.129
he became very angry with David and said,

00:14:28.129 --> 00:14:29.730
why have you come down?

00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:33.129
And with whom did you leave those few sheep in the wilderness?

00:14:33.129 --> 00:14:35.929
I will know your presumptuousness

00:14:35.929 --> 00:14:38.450
and the bad intentions of your heart.

00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:42.169
You came down just to see the battle.

00:14:43.490 --> 00:14:47.610
Now what did we learn about Alayab's personality

00:14:47.610 --> 00:14:51.419
from this verse?

00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:54.110
Not much.

00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:56.309
You recognize that as a trick question.

00:14:57.750 --> 00:14:59.629
We just met the man.

00:14:59.629 --> 00:15:01.750
We don't know very much about him.

00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:04.629
And we certainly aren't going to pass judgment

00:15:04.629 --> 00:15:08.470
on somebody over one isolated incident, are we?

00:15:09.429 --> 00:15:10.870
How the question is this?

00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:13.309
Was this a one-off for Alayab?

00:15:13.309 --> 00:15:14.789
Or was he always like that?

00:15:15.629 --> 00:15:18.350
Was this an isolated incident?

00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:20.230
Or was it a pattern?

00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:22.110
And when analyzing the situation,

00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:25.950
ask yourself this, was there ever an occasion

00:15:25.950 --> 00:15:31.429
when you got so frustrated with your fleshly brother

00:15:31.429 --> 00:15:33.629
that you said something awful,

00:15:33.629 --> 00:15:36.830
something that you had to apologize for later?

00:15:36.830 --> 00:15:39.669
Well, did that make you a terrible person?

00:15:39.669 --> 00:15:41.830
So the question is, is this a one-off?

00:15:41.830 --> 00:15:43.909
Is it isolated or is it a pattern?

00:15:43.909 --> 00:15:45.909
And these are things that we really need to apply

00:15:45.909 --> 00:15:48.710
when it comes to our relations with our brothers and sisters.

00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:53.269
Don't write somebody off on the basis of one incident.

00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:58.110
But we can see that on this occasion, Alayab was wrong.

00:15:58.110 --> 00:16:02.389
He questioned David's motives, and he wasn't nice about it.

00:16:02.389 --> 00:16:04.070
But that's not the worst of it.

00:16:04.070 --> 00:16:08.230
Suppose that David had listened to Alayab.

00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:09.509
Slow down.

00:16:09.509 --> 00:16:12.269
You're making the rest of us look bad.

00:16:12.269 --> 00:16:13.830
What might have happened?

00:16:13.830 --> 00:16:16.429
Suppose David had said, you're right, Alayab.

00:16:16.429 --> 00:16:18.350
I am a bit arrogant.

00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:22.389
So who do I think I am that I could fight this mighty man of war?

00:16:22.389 --> 00:16:26.389
Well, I could have had disastrous consequences for Israel

00:16:26.389 --> 00:16:28.629
at least temporarily.

00:16:28.629 --> 00:16:30.509
So what's the lesson?

00:16:30.509 --> 00:16:35.470
Don't discourage anyone from giving his best to Jehovah,

00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:39.269
even if his best is better than your best.

00:16:40.309 --> 00:16:42.470
Now let's take another isolated incident

00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:46.509
from the life of Alayab and say something positive about the man.

00:16:46.509 --> 00:16:49.429
Let's look for the good in Alayab.

00:16:49.429 --> 00:17:02.820
1 Samuel 22, 1 Samuel 22, and 1 verse 1.

00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:05.099
It says, so David went from there,

00:17:05.099 --> 00:17:07.619
escaping to the cave of Adolam.

00:17:07.619 --> 00:17:10.940
So David is running away from Saul.

00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:18.019
When his brothers and his father's entire house heard of it,

00:17:18.019 --> 00:17:20.980
they went down there to him.

00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:24.380
His brothers, including Alayab.

00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:26.059
So what's the point?

00:17:26.059 --> 00:17:30.059
Well, when he was needed, Alayab was there for you.

00:17:30.059 --> 00:17:31.420
He could be counter-done.

00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:37.619
And later, one of David's sons married one of Alayab's daughters.

00:17:37.619 --> 00:17:40.980
Are we to be able to see that again?

00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:45.140
David ran away from Saul.

00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:48.380
He didn't run away from Goliath, did he?

00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:51.180
But he ran away from Saul.

00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:53.819
Jehovah's spirit must have indicated

00:17:53.819 --> 00:17:56.740
when David should stand and fight,

00:17:56.740 --> 00:18:00.660
how when he should run and hide.

00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:05.240
Sounds like material for another talk.

00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:07.680
Well, it'll help our blood pressure

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:09.880
if we can learn to give a positive spin

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:13.240
to potentially negative situations.

00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:14.920
Maybe you've run into this.

00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:19.920
You're walking down the hall, following closely behind someone.

00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:26.200
He goes through the door and lets the door slam right in your face.

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:31.039
Is he self-centered or just lost in thought?

00:18:31.039 --> 00:18:34.799
How do you choose to characterize that incident?

00:18:34.799 --> 00:18:38.440
Is the public speaker a show off or on this occasion

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:43.720
is he simply trying a bit too hard to be enthusiastic?

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:48.440
Is the brother being picky or is he trying to be thorough?

00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:54.039
Stand off-ish and proud or just shy.

00:18:54.039 --> 00:18:55.359
Now, one day, some of you brothers

00:18:55.359 --> 00:18:58.000
are going to have positions of responsibility

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.960
and you're going to be dealing with people.

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:05.119
And when that happens, remember this.

00:19:05.119 --> 00:19:10.319
Many joys are denied those who keep looking for mistakes.

00:19:10.319 --> 00:19:13.680
But the one who sees the good in others

00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:17.319
will have the feast constantly.

00:19:17.319 --> 00:19:18.559
Remember that.

00:19:18.559 --> 00:19:20.799
And major, oh, bless you richly.

00:19:20.799 --> 00:19:32.039
We love you.

00:19:32.039 --> 00:19:34.240
Well, we thank you very, very much

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:37.119
for that encouraging talk for the spleen.

00:19:37.119 --> 00:19:39.559
Now, we have a member of the U.S. Branch Committee

00:19:39.559 --> 00:19:41.960
with us to deliver the talk.

00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:49.119
He causes to become, for the Troy Snyder will do this for us.

00:19:49.119 --> 00:19:51.559
Well, as Gilead graduates, you're

00:19:51.559 --> 00:19:55.839
being sent out to strengthen and stabilize

00:19:55.839 --> 00:19:58.319
Jehovah's Pressure Sheet.

00:19:58.319 --> 00:20:02.000
And you're being sent out on the threshold

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.839
of the Great Tribulation.

00:20:04.839 --> 00:20:11.640
Now, what one scripture will strengthen and stabilize you

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:14.039
so you can help others?

00:20:14.039 --> 00:20:15.519
Well, here's a clue.

00:20:15.519 --> 00:20:19.759
What truth did Jehovah reveal to fortify the Israelites

00:20:19.759 --> 00:20:23.880
right before they were to be delivered from Egypt?

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:27.519
Let's turn our Bibles to Exodus chapter 3.

00:20:27.559 --> 00:20:30.920
And let's notice what truth Jehovah revealed.

00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:35.200
Remember the account Moses was asking Jehovah,

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:38.559
what can I tell the Israelites so they

00:20:38.559 --> 00:20:40.359
would have confidence in your deliverance?

00:20:40.359 --> 00:20:42.000
And that's what he was asking Jehovah

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:46.960
to notice what Jehovah said to fortify them, verse 14.

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:53.000
So God said to Moses, I will become what I choose to become.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.119
And he added, this is what you are

00:20:55.119 --> 00:20:56.920
to say to the Israelites.

00:20:56.920 --> 00:21:01.880
I will become, has sent me to you.

00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:05.720
That fortified the Israelites.

00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:07.400
See, they understood that Jehovah was saying,

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:13.279
I'll be whatever's necessary to carry out my will.

00:21:13.279 --> 00:21:18.079
And according to Appendix A and our Nurewell translation,

00:21:18.079 --> 00:21:23.720
it appears that the name also means he causes to become.

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:26.440
Or he causes his creation, you and I,

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:30.359
to become whatever's needed to carry out his will.

00:21:30.359 --> 00:21:33.200
And doesn't that harmonize with who Jehovah is?

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:35.319
We know him as the creator, don't we?

00:21:35.319 --> 00:21:36.680
He's created us.

00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:38.759
He brought about this universe.

00:21:38.759 --> 00:21:43.240
He is the God who causes to become.

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:46.839
You see, this truth, this extraordinary truth,

00:21:46.839 --> 00:21:51.000
can strengthen and stabilize you.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:55.680
Because it links you to something that Jehovah is willing

00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:58.079
to give you.

00:21:58.079 --> 00:21:59.039
Let's look at what that is.

00:21:59.039 --> 00:22:05.470
Let's go to Jeremiah chapter 10.

00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:10.029
You see, this aspect of Jehovah's name

00:22:10.029 --> 00:22:12.349
reveals something about his personality

00:22:12.349 --> 00:22:14.269
and something that he's willing to share with you.

00:22:14.269 --> 00:22:18.190
Notice what is in verse six, Jeremiah 10.6.

00:22:18.190 --> 00:22:21.670
It says, no one is like you, O Jehovah.

00:22:21.670 --> 00:22:23.349
You are great.

00:22:23.349 --> 00:22:29.549
And your name is great and mighty.

00:22:29.549 --> 00:22:33.430
Yes, Jehovah's name is linked to his power.

00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:35.950
That's what it reveals about Jehovah.

00:22:35.950 --> 00:22:40.430
And Jehovah is willing to use his power to strengthen us.

00:22:40.430 --> 00:22:44.069
See, it's Jehovah's power that caused the Red Sea to part.

00:22:44.069 --> 00:22:47.029
It's Jehovah's power that made the sun stand still

00:22:47.029 --> 00:22:48.670
when Joshua was in battle.

00:22:48.670 --> 00:22:54.029
It's Jehovah's power that caused a bird to feed Elijah.

00:22:54.029 --> 00:22:58.470
It was Jehovah's power that took a tired prophet

00:22:58.470 --> 00:23:01.549
who was exhausted and made him run faster than a racing

00:23:01.549 --> 00:23:03.390
chariot.

00:23:03.390 --> 00:23:05.990
Isn't that reassuring to know that Jehovah is saying,

00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:09.150
I'm going to give you my power?

00:23:09.150 --> 00:23:11.549
Because oftentimes we're exhausted.

00:23:11.549 --> 00:23:14.430
We may feel like we're unraveling.

00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:17.630
But Jehovah saying, I love you so much

00:23:17.670 --> 00:23:19.789
that I'm going to give you the power you need

00:23:19.789 --> 00:23:23.990
to accomplish my will.

00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:26.430
You can see why Satan and Jehovah's enemies

00:23:26.430 --> 00:23:28.509
have tried to hide Jehovah's name.

00:23:28.509 --> 00:23:30.470
Not just because they've identified him,

00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:33.589
but they want to obscure the power that that name has

00:23:33.589 --> 00:23:38.000
and what it means to us and how it's strengthened us.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.920
But you know what else it does?

00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:43.240
It comforts us.

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:46.480
It can reassure our hearts.

00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:49.440
It can allay our fears.

00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:52.839
Notice how it did this with one of Jehovah's servants.

00:23:52.839 --> 00:23:57.420
Let's go back over to Jeremiah chapter one.

00:23:57.420 --> 00:23:59.380
Do you remember Jeremiah?

00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:02.700
He was commissioned with a very difficult assignment

00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:04.140
representing Jehovah.

00:24:05.299 --> 00:24:07.099
And what did Jeremiah express to Jehovah?

00:24:07.099 --> 00:24:08.539
He says, I'm about a boy.

00:24:08.539 --> 00:24:12.019
It's like he was saying, Jehovah, I'm inexperienced.

00:24:12.019 --> 00:24:13.819
I know I have a spiritual foundation.

00:24:13.819 --> 00:24:14.940
You've given me, you've trained me,

00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:16.859
but I don't know if I can handle this.

00:24:16.859 --> 00:24:18.460
I'm afraid.

00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:21.019
What did Jehovah say to him to fortify him?

00:24:21.059 --> 00:24:22.980
What did Jehovah cause him to become?

00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:24.500
Notice verse 18.

00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:27.180
Jeremiah chapter one verse 18.

00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:33.259
It says, for today, I have made you a fortified city,

00:24:34.220 --> 00:24:39.220
an iron pillar and copper walls against all the land

00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:42.619
toward the kings of Judah and her princes,

00:24:42.619 --> 00:24:44.900
toward her priest and the people of the land.

00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:47.940
A fortified city.

00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:49.819
So Jehovah says, I will strengthen you.

00:24:49.819 --> 00:24:51.500
I'll make you like that iron pillar.

00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:53.220
I'll give you that inner strength you need

00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:55.099
to carry out your assignment.

00:24:56.460 --> 00:25:01.460
But copper walls, what was significant about copper walls?

00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:05.660
Well, it might be how Jehovah created copper.

00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:07.980
What can copper do?

00:25:09.099 --> 00:25:13.940
Copper at very high temperature, will not buckle,

00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:16.579
will not warp, will not lose its strength.

00:25:17.579 --> 00:25:21.980
See, as if Jehovah is saying, Jeremiah, I will make it

00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:23.900
so you can take the heat.

00:25:25.579 --> 00:25:27.859
NASA Jehovah is doing for you.

00:25:27.859 --> 00:25:30.779
He will make it, make you possible

00:25:30.779 --> 00:25:32.339
to handle any situation.

00:25:32.339 --> 00:25:35.259
And you notice those are copper walls.

00:25:35.259 --> 00:25:36.140
They fortified him.

00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:37.859
They surrounded the city.

00:25:37.859 --> 00:25:41.099
It's as if mentally, emotionally, spiritually,

00:25:41.099 --> 00:25:44.420
and physically, Jehovah would give him whatever was needed

00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:45.940
to carry out his assignment.

00:25:47.579 --> 00:25:50.819
Now, that fortified Jeremiah.

00:25:50.819 --> 00:25:53.700
Could you imagine how Jeremiah may have drawn upon this

00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:56.019
as he dealt with challenges?

00:25:56.019 --> 00:25:58.859
For example, when he was persecuted,

00:25:59.819 --> 00:26:00.900
he was putting stocks.

00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:02.700
Now, that's a torture.

00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:04.339
That's a form of torture.

00:26:04.339 --> 00:26:06.700
Now, could you imagine Jeremiah's prayer?

00:26:07.619 --> 00:26:11.299
Did Jehovah cause me to become what I need to become?

00:26:11.299 --> 00:26:12.579
To stay faithful to you?

00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:16.019
Now, did Jehovah block the pain?

00:26:16.059 --> 00:26:17.019
We don't know.

00:26:17.019 --> 00:26:21.140
But what we do know is Jeremiah stayed faithful.

00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:23.140
This experience did not break his will,

00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:26.539
did not break his spirit, nor did it break his integrity.

00:26:28.259 --> 00:26:30.700
Or how about the time when Jeremiah

00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:32.220
had a golden front of the temple

00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:34.380
in front of the priest and the leaders?

00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:36.299
And he had to tell them that their precious temple

00:26:36.299 --> 00:26:37.619
was gonna be destroyed.

00:26:37.619 --> 00:26:40.619
And he had to illustrate it by slamming that clay vessel

00:26:40.619 --> 00:26:42.940
on the ground and watching it shatter.

00:26:43.940 --> 00:26:46.019
Could you imagine Jeremiah's prayer?

00:26:46.019 --> 00:26:47.940
Jehovah, help me become what I need to,

00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:50.460
to deliver this message, give me the poise,

00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:53.619
give me the courage, help me have that inner strength

00:26:53.619 --> 00:26:54.539
to do so.

00:26:56.180 --> 00:26:57.180
And Jehovah did.

00:26:58.259 --> 00:27:02.779
Jehovah was with Jeremiah time and time again.

00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:07.579
Yes, the very name of Jehovah

00:27:07.579 --> 00:27:11.099
makes it clear that you will succeed.

00:27:11.099 --> 00:27:12.740
You will be able to carry out

00:27:12.819 --> 00:27:13.579
his will.

00:27:14.619 --> 00:27:16.339
And you've been doing that.

00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:21.019
In our inner introductions to the family,

00:27:21.019 --> 00:27:23.299
we heard how Jehovah was causing you to become.

00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:27.700
For example, one of you talked about how as a young girl,

00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:32.460
you and your sister were asked to leave the family home

00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:34.500
because of your relationship with Jehovah.

00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:36.940
What happened?

00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:40.059
Jehovah caused you and others around you,

00:27:40.059 --> 00:27:41.460
your brothers and sisters,

00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:46.940
to become what was necessary to keep you close to Jehovah.

00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:48.859
One of you related how you were on a Theocratic

00:27:48.859 --> 00:27:50.940
construction expansion project,

00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:54.339
and you were assigned to cut brick in heat

00:27:54.339 --> 00:27:57.829
with all your gear on.

00:27:57.829 --> 00:27:59.710
You said you maintained your joy.

00:27:59.710 --> 00:28:00.750
Why?

00:28:00.750 --> 00:28:03.390
Because Jehovah caused you to become.

00:28:04.789 --> 00:28:06.670
One of you dear ones related to us,

00:28:06.670 --> 00:28:09.869
how you had thought your service to Jehovah

00:28:09.869 --> 00:28:11.349
had no value to him.

00:28:12.349 --> 00:28:15.750
You lost your joy, but what happened?

00:28:16.750 --> 00:28:20.309
Jehovah caused someone to encourage you,

00:28:20.309 --> 00:28:21.309
to strengthen you.

00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:26.069
And one of you related how Jehovah helped you

00:28:26.069 --> 00:28:29.109
serve beyond the capacity of your heart.

00:28:30.390 --> 00:28:33.390
Yes, Jehovah has caused all of you

00:28:33.390 --> 00:28:37.750
to become what is necessary to carry out his will.

00:28:38.789 --> 00:28:40.589
So whenever you feel discouraged,

00:28:40.589 --> 00:28:41.910
whenever you feel afraid,

00:28:41.910 --> 00:28:43.910
whenever you feel unqualified,

00:28:45.069 --> 00:28:46.509
pray to Jehovah.

00:28:46.509 --> 00:28:49.029
Ask him to help you become what is necessary

00:28:49.029 --> 00:28:50.309
to carry out his will.

00:28:50.309 --> 00:28:53.589
Help him to ask him to help you do whatever you need

00:28:55.309 --> 00:29:00.470
so you can glorify his name.

00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:05.630
Consider, when did Jehovah reveal this truth

00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:06.869
to those who are lights?

00:29:08.069 --> 00:29:11.430
It was right before they were about to face challenges.

00:29:12.430 --> 00:29:16.430
When did Jehovah reveal this truth to us

00:29:17.829 --> 00:29:22.430
who was really with the revision of her New World translation?

00:29:22.430 --> 00:29:24.430
It really helped bring it into focus,

00:29:24.430 --> 00:29:25.630
the power of his name,

00:29:25.630 --> 00:29:27.829
really right before we are to be ushered

00:29:27.829 --> 00:29:29.430
into Jehovah's New World.

00:29:31.230 --> 00:29:33.029
So what trials will you face?

00:29:34.029 --> 00:29:36.430
What challenges will you experience?

00:29:37.230 --> 00:29:39.230
What will the Great Tribulation bring?

00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:41.829
It doesn't matter.

00:29:42.829 --> 00:29:44.910
Cause you worship Jehovah.

00:29:44.910 --> 00:30:00.730
That's his name, the God who causes to become.

00:30:00.730 --> 00:30:04.170
Well, we deeply appreciate that very fine talk,

00:30:04.170 --> 00:30:05.809
Brother Snyder.

00:30:05.809 --> 00:30:07.690
Now we have Brother Donald Gordon,

00:30:07.690 --> 00:30:10.650
who serves as a helper to the publishing committee

00:30:10.650 --> 00:30:17.539
with us to deliver the talk, live and sink with Jehovah.

00:30:17.539 --> 00:30:19.140
Well, for the last five months,

00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:20.980
you dear students have been downloading

00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:23.779
a lot of wonderful information about Jehovah.

00:30:24.859 --> 00:30:28.460
Now that the class is finished, download is complete,

00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:29.579
all synced up.

00:30:30.819 --> 00:30:33.460
Well, it may seem that way for the moment.

00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:35.980
Of course, Jehovah did not create us

00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:37.099
like simple computers,

00:30:37.099 --> 00:30:41.259
where we just store away information in our memories.

00:30:41.259 --> 00:30:43.619
We were created in his image.

00:30:43.619 --> 00:30:46.980
So as we take in knowledge from Jehovah,

00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:49.259
we have the ability to absorb it,

00:30:49.259 --> 00:30:53.059
to then reflect his image, to think like him,

00:30:53.059 --> 00:30:54.940
to feel like him.

00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:57.579
We begin to act like him.

00:30:58.420 --> 00:31:02.420
So he has given us what we have here in his word,

00:31:02.420 --> 00:31:06.099
and he has well created us in our human capacity

00:31:06.099 --> 00:31:10.660
to assimilate his word into the beautiful facets

00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:15.660
of his image, and then we can truly be in sync with Jehovah.

00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:19.660
But how does our being in sync with Jehovah

00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:22.660
bring honor to him, enjoy to him?

00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:25.660
Well, when we think of the various ones

00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:27.660
who are in sync with Jehovah, no doubt

00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:30.660
the foremost example is Jesus Christ.

00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:34.660
Everything he did, everything he said,

00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:39.660
every thought he had was in full harmony with his father.

00:31:39.660 --> 00:31:42.660
Now, Jesus said, I cannot do a single thing

00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:44.660
of my own initiative.

00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:48.579
Sometimes it's like, well, a husband and wife

00:31:48.579 --> 00:31:50.619
who have been married a number of years

00:31:50.619 --> 00:31:52.700
with just a glance, without a word.

00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:54.700
They know what the other is thinking.

00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:56.299
They're in sync.

00:31:56.299 --> 00:31:58.859
Or perhaps you're thinking of two ice skaters

00:31:58.859 --> 00:32:02.180
flowing across the ice as one in unison.

00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:06.220
Well, one example of Jehovah and Jesus

00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:08.339
working in unison in sync,

00:32:08.339 --> 00:32:11.579
is when the woman with a flow of blood was cured

00:32:11.579 --> 00:32:14.500
by just touching the fringe of Jesus garment.

00:32:14.539 --> 00:32:16.859
One of our favorite miracles.

00:32:16.859 --> 00:32:18.339
At recall that scene again,

00:32:18.339 --> 00:32:20.740
recorded here at Mark chapter five,

00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:23.539
verses 29 and 30,

00:32:25.140 --> 00:32:26.660
Mark five, 29.

00:32:27.859 --> 00:32:29.779
The woman has made her way through the crowd.

00:32:29.779 --> 00:32:33.660
She touches the garment, then verse 29, immediately.

00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:35.619
Her flow of blood dried up,

00:32:35.619 --> 00:32:39.259
and she sensed in her body that she had been healed

00:32:39.259 --> 00:32:41.660
from the grievous sickness.

00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:45.619
Immediately Jesus realized in himself

00:32:45.619 --> 00:32:47.940
that power had gone out from him,

00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:50.220
and he turned around in the crowd and asked,

00:32:50.220 --> 00:32:52.059
who touched my outer garments?

00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:55.900
Well, that moment, when that woman sensed

00:32:55.900 --> 00:32:57.380
that she was cured,

00:32:57.380 --> 00:33:01.539
Jehovah and Jesus were working in complete harmony.

00:33:01.539 --> 00:33:03.099
Actually, until that moment,

00:33:03.099 --> 00:33:06.740
Jesus may have been unaware that Jehovah was watching

00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:09.579
this woman with a desire to heal her.

00:33:10.579 --> 00:33:13.339
I suppose that Jehovah could have just cured

00:33:13.339 --> 00:33:15.660
the woman on his own, as it were,

00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:18.140
without Jesus even knowing.

00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:22.740
But no, he chose to work through his son,

00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:25.059
who he knew was working in harmony with him.

00:33:26.619 --> 00:33:30.539
So when Jesus felt the power go out from him,

00:33:30.539 --> 00:33:33.099
he naturally wanted to know who was cured,

00:33:33.099 --> 00:33:36.339
who did my father see that I did not see?

00:33:36.339 --> 00:33:39.180
Because they're working together in harmony.

00:33:39.220 --> 00:33:40.940
And then seeing this woman realizing

00:33:40.940 --> 00:33:42.940
that actually she was unclean,

00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:45.099
where she did not belong.

00:33:45.099 --> 00:33:47.779
Jesus was still in complete agreement with his father.

00:33:47.779 --> 00:33:50.740
He was in sync with Jehovah's view of this woman,

00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:54.380
a very happy to have been involved in the cure of her,

00:33:55.259 --> 00:33:56.299
leaving us, of course,

00:33:56.299 --> 00:33:59.059
with one of our favorite accounts of Jesus' life.

00:34:00.299 --> 00:34:02.740
Well, what's a lesson for us?

00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:05.700
Whether we are at our work assignments,

00:34:05.700 --> 00:34:08.139
in our congregations out in the ministry,

00:34:08.139 --> 00:34:13.139
we want to be in sync with how Jehovah views other people.

00:34:13.780 --> 00:34:17.500
We often tend to view others through our own eyes.

00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:19.940
This can be clouded by our own human concerns

00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:23.780
and viewpoints, perhaps tainted by some misunderstandings

00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:27.219
or misconceptions, wrong information,

00:34:27.219 --> 00:34:30.340
perhaps our need to be a little more forgiving.

00:34:31.659 --> 00:34:35.059
You see, if any of those feelings is taint in our judgment

00:34:35.059 --> 00:34:37.659
or relationship, even in a small way,

00:34:38.860 --> 00:34:43.380
to that degree, we are out of sync with Jehovah.

00:34:43.380 --> 00:34:47.340
Jesus and Jehovah were focused on this woman's faith.

00:34:47.340 --> 00:34:51.019
Your faith has made you well, go in peace.

00:34:51.019 --> 00:34:53.659
Well, let us, in every situation,

00:34:53.659 --> 00:34:57.300
strive to see others as Jehovah sees them.

00:34:57.300 --> 00:35:01.619
This brings honor to Jehovah and allows him to use us

00:35:01.619 --> 00:35:05.090
in harmony with his will.

00:35:05.090 --> 00:35:07.690
Now, there was another situation where being in sync

00:35:07.690 --> 00:35:11.769
with his father took more time and effort.

00:35:11.769 --> 00:35:13.929
When Jesus chose his 12 apostles,

00:35:13.929 --> 00:35:16.769
he of course wanted to be in harmony with his father.

00:35:18.210 --> 00:35:21.210
But this did not happen with just a glance.

00:35:21.210 --> 00:35:26.010
Of course, Jesus had a very deep intimate knowledge of Jehovah

00:35:26.010 --> 00:35:29.210
and these men that he was considering, he knew them well.

00:35:29.210 --> 00:35:33.969
Still, this decision took hours of prayer

00:35:33.969 --> 00:35:37.650
to arrive at the 12 apostles selected.

00:35:37.690 --> 00:35:40.210
I so it will be in performing your work,

00:35:40.210 --> 00:35:42.489
making decisions at your assignments.

00:35:42.489 --> 00:35:46.530
You cannot simply rely on your knowledge of the scriptures

00:35:46.530 --> 00:35:49.130
as deep as it may be.

00:35:49.130 --> 00:35:53.610
To make decisions we must implore Jehovah with our prayers,

00:35:53.610 --> 00:35:57.289
maybe many prayers and our meditations.

00:35:57.289 --> 00:36:00.010
Don't hold back from beceaching Jehovah

00:36:00.010 --> 00:36:02.409
as you struggle for a decision,

00:36:02.409 --> 00:36:04.329
but certainly always rely, of course,

00:36:04.329 --> 00:36:07.570
on his word, the Bible, knowledge from his word,

00:36:07.570 --> 00:36:15.190
prayers to our father and then meditation on his will.

00:36:15.190 --> 00:36:17.070
Of course, you've learned in your class

00:36:17.070 --> 00:36:21.670
that the knowledge of Jehovah is such a multi-faceted gem.

00:36:21.670 --> 00:36:23.949
There is an intriguing scripture that spreads,

00:36:23.949 --> 00:36:26.829
sheds further light on this thought.

00:36:26.829 --> 00:36:32.690
Here at Ephesians chapter three, verse 19.

00:36:32.690 --> 00:36:35.050
Ephesians three, verse 19.

00:36:36.610 --> 00:36:39.849
It says, and to know the love of the Christ,

00:36:39.849 --> 00:36:41.449
which surpasses knowledge,

00:36:42.329 --> 00:36:47.329
well now how can knowing something be more than the knowledge?

00:36:49.329 --> 00:36:52.610
Well, you've learned here that the Greek term rendered to know

00:36:52.610 --> 00:36:57.289
means to know practically through experience.

00:36:58.690 --> 00:37:01.210
Now, of course, the Gospels accounts teach us much

00:37:01.210 --> 00:37:02.849
about Christ's love.

00:37:02.849 --> 00:37:05.130
We come to know that his patience, his humility,

00:37:05.130 --> 00:37:07.690
his willingness to forgive, et cetera.

00:37:07.690 --> 00:37:10.090
And we read and we study that with the light.

00:37:11.090 --> 00:37:16.250
But to really know it is like, well, a skill

00:37:16.250 --> 00:37:19.889
that we might learn only after we actually do it.

00:37:19.889 --> 00:37:24.889
For example, a doctor goes to school to learn to be a doctor.

00:37:25.610 --> 00:37:29.769
There's lots of learning years of study involved.

00:37:29.769 --> 00:37:31.730
But then when the studies are complete,

00:37:31.730 --> 00:37:34.130
they begin their internship.

00:37:34.130 --> 00:37:37.250
They begin making the rounds at the hospital.

00:37:37.250 --> 00:37:40.929
They begin now taking part of this education,

00:37:40.929 --> 00:37:42.130
what they learned from the books,

00:37:42.130 --> 00:37:45.889
and applying it to real life situations.

00:37:45.889 --> 00:37:50.130
The knowledge learned from this experience surpasses

00:37:50.130 --> 00:37:52.730
the knowledge learned in the books.

00:37:52.730 --> 00:37:54.489
So we have studied the Christ.

00:37:54.489 --> 00:37:55.889
We do the book work.

00:37:55.889 --> 00:37:57.130
We have learned.

00:37:57.130 --> 00:37:59.570
Now, you Gilead students have had the amazing opportunity

00:37:59.570 --> 00:38:03.929
these last five months to read and study about his patience,

00:38:03.929 --> 00:38:08.929
his love, his forgiveness, humility, compassion, et cetera.

00:38:09.369 --> 00:38:10.570
You cherish that knowledge.

00:38:10.570 --> 00:38:11.610
You're in sync.

00:38:12.969 --> 00:38:15.010
Not quite yet.

00:38:15.010 --> 00:38:18.050
You see, now we must do the internship.

00:38:18.050 --> 00:38:21.409
Now we must take that knowledge and make the rounds

00:38:21.409 --> 00:38:22.250
as it were.

00:38:22.250 --> 00:38:23.929
We go around the congregation.

00:38:23.929 --> 00:38:25.610
We interact with our workmates.

00:38:25.610 --> 00:38:27.690
We go out in the field ministry.

00:38:27.690 --> 00:38:31.329
You deal with a sticky difficult situation

00:38:31.329 --> 00:38:33.570
and put into practice.

00:38:33.610 --> 00:38:36.449
What you've learned from the Christ.

00:38:36.449 --> 00:38:40.409
This is the way to get the full impact.

00:38:40.409 --> 00:38:42.610
You've read and studied what he was thinking,

00:38:42.610 --> 00:38:45.570
but now you know how he was feeling,

00:38:46.969 --> 00:38:50.210
how it feels to unselfishly give of oneself

00:38:50.210 --> 00:38:51.329
in behalf of others.

00:38:51.329 --> 00:38:55.610
How does it really feel to act with humility as Jesus did?

00:38:55.610 --> 00:38:58.210
Or you come to know how it really feels

00:38:58.210 --> 00:39:02.170
to forgive from the heart as Jesus did.

00:39:02.170 --> 00:39:04.530
In this way, by experience,

00:39:04.530 --> 00:39:07.289
you come to know the love of the Christ

00:39:07.289 --> 00:39:10.570
and that surpasses the knowledge.

00:39:10.570 --> 00:39:13.489
Now, not only is what you know about God,

00:39:13.489 --> 00:39:15.409
treasure in your heart in sync,

00:39:15.409 --> 00:39:20.289
but now your actions, your life, who you are,

00:39:20.289 --> 00:39:24.300
is in sync with Jehovah.

00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:26.579
Indeed, like King David,

00:39:26.579 --> 00:39:28.619
who expressed in the 139 Psalm,

00:39:28.619 --> 00:39:31.659
you dear students have found in God's word

00:39:31.659 --> 00:39:34.579
the precious thoughts of Jehovah.

00:39:34.579 --> 00:39:37.059
Continue to search them out,

00:39:37.059 --> 00:39:40.980
bring them to mind, cherish them, and do them.

00:39:40.980 --> 00:39:43.820
And then you will be living your life

00:39:43.820 --> 00:39:51.389
in sync with Jehovah.

00:39:51.389 --> 00:39:54.429
Well, we are very grateful for that heart-felt talk,

00:39:54.429 --> 00:39:55.869
Brother Gordon.

00:39:55.869 --> 00:39:58.989
Now we go to another one of our gillied instructors

00:39:58.989 --> 00:40:00.070
for the next talk.

00:40:00.070 --> 00:40:02.190
It's Brother Mark Numer,

00:40:02.190 --> 00:40:08.579
and he will speak on the subject, offer your bow.

00:40:08.579 --> 00:40:12.780
At the age of 20, he was a natural leader,

00:40:12.780 --> 00:40:15.500
commanding a thousand men.

00:40:15.500 --> 00:40:20.139
His tribe was legendary for their military prowess.

00:40:20.139 --> 00:40:22.460
He was known as a skilled archer.

00:40:22.460 --> 00:40:25.619
His bone never turned back from its target.

00:40:25.619 --> 00:40:30.179
He was the first born, favored prince, courageous, loyal,

00:40:30.179 --> 00:40:32.300
loved by the people.

00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:36.940
Everything was lining up perfectly for Jonathan

00:40:36.940 --> 00:40:39.699
to become Israel's next king.

00:40:39.699 --> 00:40:44.500
Everything except he was not Jehovah's choice.

00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:49.980
So how would he react when he saw David

00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:53.340
receive Jehovah's special favor?

00:40:53.340 --> 00:40:57.019
How would he react when David is now transferred

00:40:57.019 --> 00:41:00.940
permanently to the king's house?

00:41:00.940 --> 00:41:03.619
Would he be filled with envy, jealousy?

00:41:03.619 --> 00:41:05.300
Would he feel threatened?

00:41:05.739 --> 00:41:09.780
Would he work to assassinate David's character?

00:41:09.780 --> 00:41:14.500
After all, David was 30 years younger than Jonathan

00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:17.579
and came from a rather insignificant family.

00:41:17.579 --> 00:41:20.260
So what would Jonathan do?

00:41:20.260 --> 00:41:21.780
This is what he did.

00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:24.579
He did something remarkable

00:41:24.579 --> 00:41:30.699
and is founded first Samuel chapter 18 and verse three and four.

00:41:30.699 --> 00:41:32.460
And this is what we want you to think about.

00:41:32.460 --> 00:41:34.219
What he did do in the application

00:41:34.219 --> 00:41:37.699
because this is so valuable for you.

00:41:37.699 --> 00:41:42.219
First Samuel chapter 18 and verse three and four.

00:41:43.659 --> 00:41:47.539
And Jonathan and David made a covenant

00:41:47.539 --> 00:41:50.179
because he loved him as himself.

00:41:50.179 --> 00:41:54.980
Now note verse four, Jonathan took off the sleeveless coat

00:41:54.980 --> 00:41:56.340
that he wore.

00:41:56.340 --> 00:41:59.659
He gave it to David along with his gear,

00:41:59.659 --> 00:42:03.460
his sword, his bow and his belt.

00:42:04.500 --> 00:42:07.980
Now this dramatic act of deep symbolism

00:42:07.980 --> 00:42:11.139
indicated that Jonathan would submit his will

00:42:11.139 --> 00:42:12.900
to Jehovah's will.

00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:15.860
He was going to humbly support David.

00:42:15.860 --> 00:42:20.619
But think about it by offering his bow to David.

00:42:21.780 --> 00:42:25.619
Jonathan was giving up a major part of his identity.

00:42:25.619 --> 00:42:29.099
The Bible describes Jonathan as a manly warrior

00:42:29.099 --> 00:42:31.860
swifter than an eagle, mightier than a lion.

00:42:31.860 --> 00:42:34.019
He was winning battles against the Philistines

00:42:34.019 --> 00:42:35.860
before David was even born.

00:42:36.940 --> 00:42:40.380
But was he worried about losing the respect of others?

00:42:40.380 --> 00:42:42.500
Did he say, what will people think of me?

00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:45.579
Will I lose my credibility if I support

00:42:45.579 --> 00:42:46.780
this younger David?

00:42:48.059 --> 00:42:48.900
No.

00:42:49.739 --> 00:42:52.780
Nor did he feel that Jehovah rejected him

00:42:52.780 --> 00:42:56.380
because of the special favor upon David.

00:42:56.380 --> 00:43:00.300
Jonathan's bow, his other war equipment,

00:43:00.300 --> 00:43:04.940
wore his trademark and that symbolized his military power.

00:43:04.940 --> 00:43:08.940
But the bow did not make the man.

00:43:10.059 --> 00:43:11.820
Love made the man.

00:43:11.820 --> 00:43:13.260
Love for Jehovah.

00:43:13.260 --> 00:43:15.260
Love for Jehovah's choices.

00:43:15.260 --> 00:43:16.900
This is what we're highlighting.

00:43:18.260 --> 00:43:23.260
And once Jonathan offered his bow, he never retracted it.

00:43:24.019 --> 00:43:28.059
Even when he knew that David would be the next king,

00:43:28.860 --> 00:43:31.260
he respected the divine arrangement.

00:43:31.260 --> 00:43:35.340
And repeatedly, Jonathan would support David.

00:43:35.340 --> 00:43:38.619
He would reassure David, you are Jehovah's choice.

00:43:40.219 --> 00:43:42.940
Jonathan was not insecure.

00:43:42.940 --> 00:43:46.019
He was not afraid to appear insignificant.

00:43:46.019 --> 00:43:48.059
He was not threatened to see David rise.

00:43:48.059 --> 00:43:52.260
Nor did he view David as a rival to be eliminated.

00:43:53.340 --> 00:43:57.940
Now in human terms, this cost Jonathan.

00:43:57.940 --> 00:44:00.619
He lost the prospect of being king.

00:44:00.619 --> 00:44:04.940
He lost his close relationship with his father.

00:44:04.940 --> 00:44:08.659
He might have lost some stature in the eyes of men.

00:44:09.500 --> 00:44:14.500
But in spiritual terms, he gained his unselfish devotion to David,

00:44:16.300 --> 00:44:18.860
received honorable mentioning God's word,

00:44:18.860 --> 00:44:20.539
which never would have happened

00:44:20.539 --> 00:44:22.699
had he resisted Jehovah's choice.

00:44:22.699 --> 00:44:25.260
We wouldn't even be talking about this right now

00:44:25.300 --> 00:44:29.619
if he took a fleshly view of Jehovah's divine arrangement.

00:44:30.739 --> 00:44:33.219
So this is your first big lesson.

00:44:33.219 --> 00:44:38.730
Don't measure your worth by your job title.

00:44:38.730 --> 00:44:40.329
It's your love of Jehovah.

00:44:40.329 --> 00:44:42.570
That's what makes you so valuable.

00:44:43.489 --> 00:44:47.769
A spiritual person is the most powerful tool in the hands of God.

00:44:47.769 --> 00:44:49.210
And this is what you are.

00:44:50.289 --> 00:44:53.090
So how can you imitate Jonathan?

00:44:53.090 --> 00:44:54.570
Offer your bow.

00:44:55.570 --> 00:44:59.769
By showing your support of Jehovah's organizational decisions,

00:44:59.769 --> 00:45:04.730
even if it means giving up something you love or want to cling to.

00:45:05.650 --> 00:45:11.010
For example, some of you have been given new country assignments

00:45:11.010 --> 00:45:15.730
and yet you might not have planned on moving to another country.

00:45:15.730 --> 00:45:17.170
You were content where you were.

00:45:17.170 --> 00:45:19.090
You were happy doing what you were doing.

00:45:20.610 --> 00:45:22.250
Thank you.

00:45:22.329 --> 00:45:26.369
Thank you for your unselfish support of the decisions made

00:45:26.369 --> 00:45:29.090
to advance Kingdom interest globally.

00:45:29.090 --> 00:45:30.090
Thank you.

00:45:31.369 --> 00:45:34.530
Or perhaps you've been trained in some capacity,

00:45:34.530 --> 00:45:36.570
something you really enjoy.

00:45:36.570 --> 00:45:39.489
And yet now someone else is assigned to do that job.

00:45:40.849 --> 00:45:44.570
Will you, like Jonathan, put your heart into supporting

00:45:44.570 --> 00:45:48.610
and reassuring the new person that took your job?

00:45:49.849 --> 00:45:51.650
And how about you as a sister?

00:45:52.610 --> 00:45:57.170
What about if a new sister comes and gets the job assignment you love?

00:45:57.170 --> 00:45:58.849
You cherish, you wake up every day.

00:45:58.849 --> 00:46:00.050
I love my job.

00:46:00.889 --> 00:46:03.329
And now you're asked to train her.

00:46:03.329 --> 00:46:04.730
What will you do?

00:46:04.730 --> 00:46:06.170
Will you offer your bow?

00:46:07.769 --> 00:46:12.489
Or the sister gets the office that you dreamed of.

00:46:12.489 --> 00:46:13.570
The one with the window.

00:46:13.570 --> 00:46:14.409
There it is.

00:46:14.409 --> 00:46:15.809
You had your eyes set on it.

00:46:17.289 --> 00:46:18.530
You might have seniority.

00:46:18.530 --> 00:46:20.050
She could be younger than you.

00:46:20.050 --> 00:46:24.170
But perhaps oversight took other factors into consideration

00:46:24.170 --> 00:46:26.130
that you are not aware of.

00:46:26.130 --> 00:46:27.730
What will you do?

00:46:27.730 --> 00:46:30.530
What will all of you do in these situations?

00:46:30.530 --> 00:46:33.929
Will you accept the fact that supporting decisions

00:46:33.929 --> 00:46:38.409
by the organization at times involves sacrifices on your part?

00:46:40.170 --> 00:46:42.570
Well, let your love for Jehovah

00:46:42.570 --> 00:46:46.250
mean more than you're cherished work assignment.

00:46:46.250 --> 00:46:48.730
And this is a very, very big lesson,

00:46:48.730 --> 00:46:52.650
lesson number one, and very important for you to think about.

00:46:52.650 --> 00:46:55.170
Offering your bow in this way.

00:46:56.489 --> 00:46:58.329
You've already shown this spirit.

00:46:58.329 --> 00:47:01.730
We're just reinforcing something that you need to hear

00:47:01.730 --> 00:47:05.349
prior to your departure.

00:47:05.349 --> 00:47:10.110
Now, I want you to think about this for a moment.

00:47:10.110 --> 00:47:12.309
Compared Jonathan's good example

00:47:13.309 --> 00:47:16.469
with that of his brother, Ishbo Sheth.

00:47:17.469 --> 00:47:19.469
When Saul died,

00:47:19.469 --> 00:47:23.469
2 Samuel 2 and verse 8 says,

00:47:23.469 --> 00:47:28.469
His general abner made Ishbo Sheth king.

00:47:28.469 --> 00:47:31.469
No loyalty to Jehovah's choice,

00:47:31.469 --> 00:47:34.469
and Ishbo Sheth agreed, I want that.

00:47:34.469 --> 00:47:37.469
Ishbo Sheth craved position,

00:47:37.469 --> 00:47:39.469
which led to a civil war,

00:47:39.469 --> 00:47:42.469
which led to problems.

00:47:42.469 --> 00:47:45.469
Now, instead of Ishbo Sheth offering his bow

00:47:45.469 --> 00:47:48.469
and his war equipment to David,

00:47:48.469 --> 00:47:54.469
2 Samuel 2 describes how he provoked war with David,

00:47:54.469 --> 00:48:00.469
which resulted in bloodshed and the death of 380 men in Israel.

00:48:00.469 --> 00:48:03.469
Ishbo Sheth's heart, it wasn't with David,

00:48:03.469 --> 00:48:06.469
that was Jehovah's choice.

00:48:06.469 --> 00:48:09.469
He was unlike his brother Jonathan.

00:48:09.469 --> 00:48:14.469
But now imagine if Jonathan was still alive

00:48:14.469 --> 00:48:15.469
when Saul died.

00:48:15.469 --> 00:48:17.469
And Abner now comes to Jonathan and say,

00:48:17.469 --> 00:48:19.469
Jonathan, I want you to be king.

00:48:19.469 --> 00:48:21.469
You'd make a great king.

00:48:21.469 --> 00:48:23.469
Would Jonathan have agreed?

00:48:23.469 --> 00:48:24.469
Would he have then said,

00:48:24.469 --> 00:48:25.469
Give me my bow back.

00:48:25.469 --> 00:48:27.469
Retract it, take it back,

00:48:27.469 --> 00:48:28.469
and tell David,

00:48:28.469 --> 00:48:30.469
No, I feigned loyalty to you.

00:48:30.469 --> 00:48:31.469
This is what I really wanted.

00:48:31.469 --> 00:48:32.469
I want to be king.

00:48:32.469 --> 00:48:33.469
No.

00:48:33.469 --> 00:48:34.469
No.

00:48:34.469 --> 00:48:36.469
Jonathan wouldn't have done that.

00:48:36.469 --> 00:48:37.469
Why?

00:48:37.469 --> 00:48:41.469
Because he gave not just his bow to David.

00:48:41.469 --> 00:48:43.469
He gave not just his war equipment to David.

00:48:43.469 --> 00:48:47.469
No, he gave his very heart to Jehovah's choice.

00:48:47.469 --> 00:48:49.469
And that's the beautiful thing about him,

00:48:49.469 --> 00:48:52.469
the difference between Jonathan,

00:48:52.469 --> 00:48:56.469
who sees an opportunity to support Jehovah's cause.

00:48:56.469 --> 00:49:00.469
And Ishbo Sheth, who never thought for a moment

00:49:00.469 --> 00:49:06.469
about how Jehovah God was directing David, is striking.

00:49:06.469 --> 00:49:09.469
And the results speak for themselves.

00:49:09.469 --> 00:49:12.469
Jonathan was loved and honored.

00:49:12.469 --> 00:49:16.469
Ishbo Sheth was hated and murdered.

00:49:16.469 --> 00:49:21.840
When Jonathan died,

00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:26.840
David was so deeply grieved by the loss of his dear friend

00:49:26.840 --> 00:49:29.840
that he was moved to do something.

00:49:29.840 --> 00:49:35.840
And what he did is recorded at Second Samuel, chapter 1,

00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:37.840
and verse 17 and 18.

00:49:37.840 --> 00:49:40.840
I'd like to read this to you.

00:49:40.840 --> 00:49:43.840
Second Samuel, chapter 1, 17 and 18.

00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:50.099
And David chanted this dirge,

00:49:50.099 --> 00:49:54.099
or this song over Saul and his son, Jonathan,

00:49:54.099 --> 00:49:57.099
and said that the people of Judah

00:49:57.099 --> 00:50:02.099
should be taught the dirge, the song called the bow.

00:50:02.099 --> 00:50:04.099
The bow.

00:50:04.099 --> 00:50:08.099
Could David have had in mind the bow

00:50:08.099 --> 00:50:12.099
that Jonathan gave him at the beginning of their friendship?

00:50:12.099 --> 00:50:15.099
Jonathan supported the nation without demanding

00:50:15.099 --> 00:50:18.099
that he receive high rank or position.

00:50:18.099 --> 00:50:20.099
Jonathan was so loyal.

00:50:20.099 --> 00:50:23.099
It was a powerful lesson that David never forgot

00:50:23.099 --> 00:50:26.099
and neither did he want the sons of Judah to forget

00:50:26.099 --> 00:50:30.099
because he instructed they all learn this song by heart.

00:50:30.099 --> 00:50:38.739
Offering your bow is a powerful word picture.

00:50:38.739 --> 00:50:41.739
When you continue to work in the background,

00:50:41.739 --> 00:50:43.739
work quietly in the background,

00:50:43.739 --> 00:50:46.739
in loyal support of Jehovah's choices.

00:50:46.739 --> 00:50:49.739
Despite the cost, despite the human imperfections,

00:50:49.739 --> 00:50:51.739
despite the disappointments,

00:50:51.739 --> 00:50:53.739
despite the perceived injustices,

00:50:53.739 --> 00:50:55.739
don't worry about all of that.

00:50:55.739 --> 00:50:58.739
That's simply the ebb and flow of life.

00:50:58.739 --> 00:51:01.739
Pick yourself up, keep on moving grow mighty,

00:51:01.739 --> 00:51:05.739
become a living example to the brotherhood in loyalty.

00:51:05.739 --> 00:51:08.739
That's what you've been trained to do.

00:51:08.739 --> 00:51:11.739
And you will receive Jehovah's attention and favor

00:51:11.739 --> 00:51:14.739
just as Jonathan did.

00:51:14.739 --> 00:51:17.739
Jehovah did not merely dismiss Jonathan

00:51:17.739 --> 00:51:19.739
as a would-have-been king.

00:51:19.739 --> 00:51:20.739
No.

00:51:20.739 --> 00:51:24.739
Rather, he took note of Jonathan's loyal support

00:51:24.739 --> 00:51:28.739
and had his wonderful example embedded etched

00:51:28.739 --> 00:51:30.739
into his inspired word.

00:51:30.739 --> 00:51:35.780
So as you go to your assignment,

00:51:35.780 --> 00:51:39.780
what is your bow?

00:51:39.780 --> 00:51:41.780
Everyone has one.

00:51:41.780 --> 00:51:44.780
Is it your cherished work assignment?

00:51:44.780 --> 00:51:46.780
Is it that privilege that you have been given

00:51:46.780 --> 00:51:49.780
that few others enjoy?

00:51:49.780 --> 00:51:51.780
Is it the responsibility

00:51:51.780 --> 00:51:55.780
that requires many to consult you for direction?

00:51:55.780 --> 00:51:57.780
Well, think about this.

00:51:57.780 --> 00:51:59.780
The time will come

00:51:59.780 --> 00:52:02.780
when someone is put in a leading role.

00:52:02.780 --> 00:52:05.780
And you will be asked to support that person,

00:52:05.780 --> 00:52:08.780
work under that person, help that person.

00:52:08.780 --> 00:52:11.780
And when that time comes, ask yourself,

00:52:11.780 --> 00:52:14.780
what will I do?

00:52:14.780 --> 00:52:16.780
And not just you brothers.

00:52:16.780 --> 00:52:18.780
You sisters too.

00:52:18.780 --> 00:52:19.780
I mean, you wives.

00:52:19.780 --> 00:52:20.780
Will you support?

00:52:20.780 --> 00:52:22.780
Will the wife support as well?

00:52:22.780 --> 00:52:23.780
Single sisters.

00:52:23.780 --> 00:52:25.780
Will you support the arrangement?

00:52:25.780 --> 00:52:26.780
That's the point.

00:52:26.780 --> 00:52:28.780
Ask yourself, will I offer my bow?

00:52:28.780 --> 00:52:31.780
Like Jonathan, will I offer it freely?

00:52:31.780 --> 00:52:34.780
Well, I offer it generously to anyone,

00:52:34.780 --> 00:52:37.780
chosen for a role of responsibility

00:52:37.780 --> 00:52:39.780
within God's organization.

00:52:39.780 --> 00:52:41.780
And be assured Jehovah,

00:52:41.780 --> 00:52:43.780
in turn, will offer you,

00:52:43.780 --> 00:52:46.780
offer you an unimaginable treasure.

00:52:46.780 --> 00:52:50.780
And that treasure is his favor and approval.

00:52:50.780 --> 00:52:52.780
Jehovah's favor and approval.

00:52:52.780 --> 00:52:54.780
What is better than that?

00:52:54.780 --> 00:52:57.780
Now and life in the New World.

00:52:57.780 --> 00:52:59.780
And when you get to the New World,

00:52:59.780 --> 00:53:01.780
be sure to look for the one

00:53:01.780 --> 00:53:05.780
that inspired you to offer your bow.

00:53:05.780 --> 00:53:21.699
Well, we thank you, brother Namar,

00:53:21.699 --> 00:53:24.699
very much for that encouraging talk.

00:53:24.699 --> 00:53:29.699
In fact, we've enjoyed a series of wonderful talks this morning, haven't we?

00:53:29.699 --> 00:53:32.699
What an encouraging program thus far.

00:53:32.699 --> 00:53:34.699
And in the upcoming weeks,

00:53:34.699 --> 00:53:37.699
look for parts two and three

00:53:37.699 --> 00:53:39.699
of the graduation program.

00:53:39.699 --> 00:53:42.699
They'll be found under latest videos

00:53:42.699 --> 00:53:44.699
or under the video on demand segment

00:53:44.699 --> 00:53:46.699
of JW Broadcasting.

00:53:46.699 --> 00:53:49.699
We'll conclude this month's program

00:53:49.699 --> 00:53:52.699
by traveling to the tropical island of Kashi

00:53:52.699 --> 00:53:54.699
in Micronesia.

00:53:54.699 --> 00:53:56.699
Located in the Pacific Ocean,

00:53:56.699 --> 00:53:59.699
Kashi is filled with dense jungle,

00:53:59.699 --> 00:54:02.699
mangroves, picturesque beaches,

00:54:02.699 --> 00:54:05.699
and is surrounded by beautiful coral.

00:54:05.699 --> 00:54:08.699
Many on the island work in the tourism,

00:54:08.699 --> 00:54:11.699
fishing, or agricultural industries.

00:54:11.699 --> 00:54:14.699
Although the official language of Kashi is English,

00:54:14.699 --> 00:54:17.699
there's a remote translation office here.

00:54:17.699 --> 00:54:20.699
One brother and four sisters assist

00:54:20.699 --> 00:54:23.699
with translating literature into Kashi-in.

00:54:23.699 --> 00:54:25.699
There's one congregation on Kashi,

00:54:25.699 --> 00:54:27.699
with two field missionaries,
