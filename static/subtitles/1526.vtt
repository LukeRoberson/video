00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.089
A special event took place on December 16, 2017

00:00:09.089 --> 00:00:13.589
that was a milestone in the history of Jehovah's Witnesses in Italy.

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:18.589
Around 8,000 witnesses attended at a sports arena in Rome.

00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:23.589
Brothers were also tied in from all the Kingdom Halls and assembly halls throughout Italy

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:28.539
and Italian-speaking Switzerland.

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:32.539
The first part of the program allowed the audience to relive the history

00:00:32.539 --> 00:00:36.539
of the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures in Italy.

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:44.939
In the 1950s and 60s, it was difficult to obtain a copy of the Bible.

00:00:44.939 --> 00:00:49.939
People could only purchase them from the few religious bookstores than existing.

00:00:49.939 --> 00:00:56.469
During those years, many who were interested in God's word

00:00:56.469 --> 00:00:58.469
flooded into the congregations.

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.469
In order to provide them with Bibles, large quantities of various editions

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:06.469
were bought and then distributed at cost.

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:10.469
However, those editions were not always available.

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:15.469
So when in January 1967, it was announced that the New World Translation

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:18.469
of the Holy Scriptures in Italian would be printed.

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:21.469
There was great excitement among the brothers,

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:25.469
who could finally all use the same translation of God's word.

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:30.469
There have been constant improvements made to the New World Translation through the years

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:35.469
and it has been made available in various formats and editions.

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:45.310
On December 16, 2017, Brother Samuel Heard, a member of the governing body,

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.310
presented the new revised edition of the New World Translation in Italian.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:56.310
By now, you may be thinking, what about the New World Translation in our language?

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:04.310
And now, we will never be revised like the New World Translation in English.

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.310
The translation of the New World will never be revised like that one in English.

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.310
What do you think is in this package?

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:52.520
What do you think is there in this package?

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.520
I was so moved, it brought me to tears.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.520
I was near Sam Elderly once when the Bible was released,

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.520
just thinking about their endurance through the years

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.520
and now to be holding a new revised edition of the Bible,

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.520
it really touched me to see their joy when they received it.

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:16.520
It was really moving, very touching to see the brothers open their Bibles and leave through them.

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.520
They had been waiting for years.

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:24.520
I felt like a little child, I was so excited.

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.520
Like when you know your dad's going to give you a present, you know it's coming,

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:32.520
but you don't know when. And when it arrives, you just jump for joy.

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:41.810
My name is Mathia and this Bible is my present from Jehovah.

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.810
I can't wait to read the Bible all over again from the beginning.

00:03:45.810 --> 00:04:01.229
It will definitely make daily Bible reading more enjoyable.

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:11.939
I really felt Jehovah's tender care for me, I was so happy.

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:19.939
All 284,258 attending the event in Rome or tied in from other locations

00:04:19.939 --> 00:04:22.939
received a copy of the much awaited gift.

00:04:22.939 --> 00:04:28.939
An expression of the deep love of Jehovah, the author of the Holy Bible.
