00:00:01.139 --> 00:00:07.040
Humans are born with a strong inclination to imitate.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:13.539
In fact, very young infants have been observed imitating facial expressions.

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:15.539
That's amazing.

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:22.539
Makes me think of an experience I had some forty years ago when Susan and I were in the circuit work.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:33.140
A sister told me that her little five-year-old son was looking in a mirror and making various expressions with his face and eyes.

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.439
His mother asked, what are you doing?

00:00:36.439 --> 00:00:41.240
He said, I can't do like brother let.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:45.479
I'll never be a circuit overseer.

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:53.579
Well, I'm sure he soon learned that voluminous facial expressions are not a requirement for circuit work.

00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:57.479
In fact, they could be a disadvantage.

00:00:57.479 --> 00:01:03.880
By the way, thank you for putting up with me all these years.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:09.480
But how does a small child learn to walk, feed himself and talk?

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.680
He learns by imitating his parents and others.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:21.480
However, there's one type of imitating that does not come automatically or even easily.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.079
It's identified at Ephesians 5.1.

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:33.379
It says, therefore, become imitators of God as beloved children.

00:01:33.379 --> 00:01:35.579
Notice the word become.

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:41.579
We are not born as imitators of God because of inherited imperfection.

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:47.579
We aren't even born with an inclination to become an imitator of God.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:56.680
Genesis 8.21 says, for the inclination of the heart of man is bad from his youth up.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:02.379
Therefore, it takes earnest effort to become an imitator of God.

00:02:02.379 --> 00:02:07.480
But it's well worth the effort and Jehovah will help us.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:14.379
What blessings will we personally read if we become an imitator of God?

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:19.979
The greatest blessing Jehovah will see that we are trying to be like him

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:23.979
and he will love us and draw close to us.

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:28.780
Also, the more we learn about Jehovah and strive to be like him,

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:34.979
the more we'll love him and the closer we'll draw to him.

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:40.979
Cultivating Godly qualities will result in improved relations with others.

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:46.080
Imitating Godly qualities will make us a better person overall.

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:51.180
The more we like Jehovah, the happier we'll be.

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.080
That's how He created us.

00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:02.780
Those are just a few of the blessings we'll reap if we become an imitator of God.

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:08.280
In our publications, more than 40 different qualities of Jehovah

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:11.879
have been identified and discussed.

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:15.979
But in this discussion, let's examine just one.

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:22.780
We'll discuss the theme, imitate Jehovah's generosity.

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.280
Generosity is an aspect of Jehovah's love.

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:34.080
Unquestionably, Jehovah God is the most generous giver in the universe.

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.280
Let's talk about this.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.780
Eons and eons ago, Jehovah God was all alone.

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.479
And even though it's impossible for us to comprehend,

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:51.680
He wasn't lonely or lacking anything, but because of love.

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:57.680
He generously chose to share the gift of life with others.

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.479
He decided to become a father, a creator.

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:09.379
Logically, He began by creating a son with whom He could directly enjoy fellowship.

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:16.079
As we know, this son became known as the word, as Jehovah spokesman.

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:22.279
But then, at some point in time again, not because of loneliness or lacking anything,

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:28.379
but because of love, He chose to further expand His family

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:36.879
by creating millions of angelic sons who could also directly associate with Him.

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:42.379
Then amazingly, further down the stream of time, because of love,

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:46.180
He again chose to expand His family.

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.879
These children were a lower form of life,

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:54.379
but ones who were made in His image, and whom He loved deeply.

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:57.480
Of course, we're talking about Adam and Eve.

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:01.480
The original parents of all of us.

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:07.680
If Jehovah had not created them, none of us would ever have been born.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:15.579
Yes, life itself is a wonderful, miraculous, and generous gift.

00:05:15.579 --> 00:05:22.879
Without this gift, we wouldn't be able to enjoy any of Jehovah's other marvelous blessings.

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:29.879
Let's now talk about Jehovah's generosity when it comes to physical gifts.

00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:36.180
Every good gift and every perfect present is from above.

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:40.180
Think for a moment about the planet we live on.

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:46.180
Jehovah created the earth as a beautiful and unique home for us.

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:50.579
It has all the right conditions to sustain life,

00:05:50.579 --> 00:05:59.779
including the oxygen and water cycles that continually recycle essential resources.

00:05:59.779 --> 00:06:05.579
If the earth were closer to the sun, all the water would boil off,

00:06:05.579 --> 00:06:07.879
and the planet would be a barren rock.

00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:14.480
Conversely, if it were farther from the sun, the water would freeze,

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:19.680
and the planet would be like an uninhabitable iceberg.

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:29.379
Jehovah placed the earth at the perfect location, often called the Goldilocks Zone.

00:06:29.379 --> 00:06:34.579
Think too about the marvelous gift of our human bodies.

00:06:34.579 --> 00:06:43.879
Even in our imperfect state, as mentioned at Psalm 139.14, we are wonderfully made.

00:06:43.879 --> 00:06:48.379
Isn't it brilliant how our skin is designed to heal

00:06:48.379 --> 00:06:51.379
when we cut, scrape, or bruise it?

00:06:51.379 --> 00:06:54.879
When we scratch, scrape, or dent our car?

00:06:54.879 --> 00:06:57.279
Does it heal itself?

00:06:57.279 --> 00:07:03.279
Can you imagine what we would look like if every time we damage our skin,

00:07:03.279 --> 00:07:05.980
it just stayed that way?

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:11.579
We'd begin to look pretty rough in just a short period of time.

00:07:11.579 --> 00:07:18.079
And isn't it amazing how the skin allows water to exit the body

00:07:18.079 --> 00:07:20.480
in the form of perspiration?

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:27.480
But at the same time, it doesn't allow water to enter the body when we take a bath.

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:31.180
Otherwise, we'd become waterlogged.

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:37.180
Ponder for a moment about how food is not only nutritious,

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:40.779
but it's also delicious.

00:07:40.779 --> 00:07:44.680
This makes fueling our bodies very enjoyable.

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:50.180
Jehovah could have made eating like putting gasoline in a car.

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:55.879
A necessary function, but void of enjoyment.

00:07:55.879 --> 00:07:59.579
Think of all the tasty varieties of food.

00:07:59.579 --> 00:08:05.779
As just one example, how many varieties of grapes are there?

00:08:05.779 --> 00:08:09.480
According to the food in agriculture organization,

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:15.680
there are about 10,000 different great varieties worldwide.

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:22.480
Jehovah could have given us just two varieties, red and green.

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:26.379
But why do we have some 10,000 varieties?

00:08:26.379 --> 00:08:31.779
Because of Jehovah's voluminous generosity.

00:08:31.779 --> 00:08:39.379
But now we ask, how can we imitate Jehovah's generosity in giving physical gifts?

00:08:39.779 --> 00:08:44.879
It's obvious that Jehovah's put a lot of thought into his gift-giving

00:08:44.879 --> 00:08:49.779
so that his gifts are practical and beneficial.

00:08:49.779 --> 00:08:55.779
Likewise, we should prayerfully meditate so that our gifts are useful.

00:08:55.779 --> 00:08:58.480
Not all gifts are practical.

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:00.980
One brother gave this example.

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:07.379
A puppy might make a fine gift to a young one living in a rural setting.

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:12.059
But it's a terrible gift to a Bethelite.

00:09:12.059 --> 00:09:16.659
If our brother lacks food, clothing or shelter,

00:09:16.659 --> 00:09:23.559
we don't just say, go in peace, keep warm and well fed.

00:09:23.559 --> 00:09:29.559
No, we apply Proverbs 327, which says,

00:09:29.559 --> 00:09:33.759
do not withhold good from those to whom you should give it

00:09:33.759 --> 00:09:38.259
if it is within your power to help.

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:42.159
In addition to helping brothers in need directly,

00:09:42.159 --> 00:09:49.360
we can indirectly help them by making donations to the worldwide work.

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:53.360
The governing body prayerfully strives to use wisely

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:58.259
these precious, dedicated funds to help our dear brothers

00:09:58.259 --> 00:10:03.159
who've been afflicted by natural or man-made disasters

00:10:03.159 --> 00:10:06.960
and who urgently need suitable kingdom halls

00:10:07.059 --> 00:10:10.759
and assistance in many other ways.

00:10:10.759 --> 00:10:15.559
Speaking of the need for kingdom halls as just one example,

00:10:15.559 --> 00:10:19.059
please look at these pictures from the Philippines.

00:10:19.059 --> 00:10:25.059
Here are six before and after photographs.

00:10:25.059 --> 00:10:28.559
And what do you think was the individual average cost

00:10:28.559 --> 00:10:34.860
of these six new simplified but dignified kingdom halls?

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:39.559
$21,000 US dollars.

00:10:39.559 --> 00:10:41.759
Please think about this.

00:10:41.759 --> 00:10:46.759
Jehovah's physical gifts such as the rain, sunshine and oxygen

00:10:46.759 --> 00:10:49.259
are recurring.

00:10:49.259 --> 00:10:54.259
What's one way to imitate this aspect of Jehovah's giving?

00:10:54.259 --> 00:10:57.559
Well, 1 Corinthians 162 says,

00:10:57.559 --> 00:11:00.659
on the first day of every week each of you

00:11:00.659 --> 00:11:07.059
should set something aside according to his own means.

00:11:07.059 --> 00:11:10.360
In harmony with the scriptural principle,

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:14.860
many have chosen to set something aside each month

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:20.360
by scheduling recurring online donations.

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:24.559
But now let's briefly contemplate Jehovah's spiritual gifts

00:11:24.559 --> 00:11:27.460
which are even more impressive.

00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:29.559
Think about the Bible.

00:11:29.559 --> 00:11:32.259
Where would we be without it?

00:11:32.259 --> 00:11:36.759
Lost, hopeless, floundering.

00:11:36.759 --> 00:11:41.559
We'd have to learn by experience, the School of Hard Knocks.

00:11:41.559 --> 00:11:45.159
We'd need at least two lives to live.

00:11:45.159 --> 00:11:51.259
One to practice and the second to perform.

00:11:51.259 --> 00:11:54.259
Next, think about the Holy Spirit.

00:11:54.259 --> 00:12:01.860
John 1426 describes it as a helper, teacher and a remembrance, sir.

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:06.960
It is the most powerful force in the universe and Jehovah gives it to us

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:08.960
generously.

00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:12.159
Consider for a moment the resurrection hope.

00:12:12.159 --> 00:12:16.559
It strengthens us in time of great distress

00:12:16.559 --> 00:12:19.259
when death takes a loved one,

00:12:19.259 --> 00:12:22.759
or when we face death ourselves.

00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:26.360
I'm reminded of the six-year-old girl who said,

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:30.860
thank you, Jehovah, for the resurrection hope.

00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:35.360
It is a very good idea.

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:37.559
For a final example,

00:12:37.559 --> 00:12:42.159
what was Jehovah's greatest spiritual gift of generosity?

00:12:42.159 --> 00:12:43.960
The gift of his son,

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:47.559
to purchase us from sin and death.

00:12:47.559 --> 00:12:51.460
And it wasn't just any angel whom Jehovah sent.

00:12:51.559 --> 00:12:53.559
It was his firstborn,

00:12:53.559 --> 00:12:56.559
his only begotten son.

00:12:56.559 --> 00:12:59.259
What if you were tied to a chair

00:12:59.259 --> 00:13:05.259
and forced to watch the torture and execution of your most beloved child?

00:13:05.259 --> 00:13:08.059
That would be horrible.

00:13:08.059 --> 00:13:10.960
Of course, Jehovah was not tied,

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:13.860
but because of his great love for us,

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:16.159
he restrained himself

00:13:16.159 --> 00:13:21.360
and allowed the torture and execution of his most precious son.

00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:27.759
That is the ultimate example of generosity.

00:13:27.759 --> 00:13:29.259
But now we ask,

00:13:29.259 --> 00:13:32.759
how can we imitate Jehovah's generosity

00:13:32.759 --> 00:13:35.659
in giving spiritual gifts?

00:13:35.659 --> 00:13:37.659
One way by being generous

00:13:37.659 --> 00:13:40.960
and giving sincere commendation.

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:43.659
If you see something good,

00:13:43.659 --> 00:13:46.259
say something good.

00:13:46.259 --> 00:13:49.059
Proverbs 15, 23 says,

00:13:49.159 --> 00:13:55.159
a word spoken at the right time how good it is.

00:13:55.159 --> 00:13:57.960
Words have great power.

00:13:57.960 --> 00:13:59.259
To illustrate,

00:13:59.259 --> 00:14:02.159
think of how two words from a convention chairman

00:14:02.159 --> 00:14:05.159
can lift thousands of pounds.

00:14:05.159 --> 00:14:06.960
What are they?

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:09.960
Please stand.

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:11.360
In this vein,

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:13.960
Proverbs 1821 says,

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:19.360
death and life are in the power of the tongue.

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:21.460
Just a few words at the right time

00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:25.460
can make a tremendous difference in a person's life.

00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:28.759
They can cause a depressed one to stand

00:14:28.759 --> 00:14:32.960
with a positive hope for the future.

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:37.159
Another way freely give out forgiveness.

00:14:37.159 --> 00:14:39.960
Colossians 3.13 reminds us

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:43.259
that Jehovah freely forgives us

00:14:43.259 --> 00:14:47.860
and that we must also do the same.

00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:49.659
The word freely in English

00:14:49.659 --> 00:14:52.159
means generously

00:14:52.159 --> 00:14:55.259
and can also mean without charge.

00:14:55.259 --> 00:14:57.860
Is there someone you can extend

00:14:57.860 --> 00:14:59.659
true forgiveness to

00:14:59.659 --> 00:15:02.860
in imitation of our generous God?

00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:04.460
Additionally,

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:07.860
how about generously giving out knowledge?

00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:10.159
Do we pray for a Bible study

00:15:10.159 --> 00:15:12.759
and then work in harmony with those prayers

00:15:12.759 --> 00:15:17.360
by searching diligently for a deserving one?

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:19.159
Do we liberally train others

00:15:19.159 --> 00:15:22.460
and share the skills we have in the ministry

00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:24.259
and in the maintenance and construction

00:15:24.259 --> 00:15:27.559
of theocratic facilities?

00:15:27.559 --> 00:15:31.659
People in general often hoard the knowledge they have

00:15:31.659 --> 00:15:34.460
in order to protect their job.

00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:36.460
But like Jehovah,

00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:42.460
we gladly share the knowledge we have with others.

00:15:42.559 --> 00:15:44.559
During our discussion,

00:15:44.559 --> 00:15:47.159
we barely scratch the surface

00:15:47.159 --> 00:15:49.860
regarding Jehovah's generosity

00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:52.460
and how we can imitate Him.

00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:54.759
We will learn forever

00:15:54.759 --> 00:15:56.860
about our great God

00:15:56.860 --> 00:16:00.460
and how we can better reflect His qualities.

00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:02.259
But in the meantime,

00:16:02.259 --> 00:16:04.659
the more we learn about Him

00:16:04.659 --> 00:16:07.860
and the more closely we can imitate Him,

00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:09.659
the richer,

00:16:09.659 --> 00:16:13.259
happier and more satisfying

00:16:13.259 --> 00:16:15.259
our lives will be.

00:16:15.259 --> 00:16:17.259
And why?

00:16:17.259 --> 00:16:20.259
Because that's how He created us.
