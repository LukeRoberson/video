00:00:02.799 --> 00:00:08.800
This video shows Mount Gyrism, which is situated in the heart of the district of Samaria.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:21.120
Its summit rises over 850 meters or 2800 feet above the Mediterranean Sea.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:27.120
Mount Gyrism, one, is near the traditional location of Jacob's well.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:35.119
The present-day city of Nablus is situated between Mount Gyrism and Mount Ebal in the fertile valley of Shikim.

00:00:35.119 --> 00:00:43.119
This location, too, indicates the approximate place where Jesus spoke to the Samaritan woman.

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:53.119
A Samaritan temple was constructed on Mount Gyrism, perhaps in the 4th century BCE, but was destroyed in 128 BCE.

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:57.119
Mount Ebal, three, is seen here.

00:00:57.119 --> 00:01:05.709
It was evidently with reference to Mount Gyrism that the Samaritan woman told Jesus Christ,

00:01:05.709 --> 00:01:13.709
our forefathers worshipped on this mountain, but you people say that in Jerusalem is the place where people must worship.

00:01:13.709 --> 00:01:19.709
To show her that true worship was not to be dependent on a physical location, Jesus replied,

00:01:19.709 --> 00:01:25.709
the hour is coming when neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father.

00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:29.709
John 4, 20, and 21.
