WEBVTT

00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.849
We are now going to talk about keep on encouraging one another.

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:11.849
So what does it mean to be encouraging?

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.850
Well, we may think saying some nice words or going to someone and tell them,

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.850
well, whenever you need anything, I'm here for you.

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:25.850
Almost like a crowd in a stadium cheering on the athletes.

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:30.850
However, Christian encouragement is a little deeper than that.

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:36.850
Let us turn you to Romans chapter 1 and see what Paul says about this.

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.850
Romans chapter 1 verses 11 and 12.

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:49.850
He says, for I'm longing to see you that I may impart some spiritual gift to you

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:55.850
for you to be made firm or rather that we might have an interchange of encouragement

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:01.850
by one another's faith, both yours and mine.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.849
This expression interchange of encouragement.

00:01:06.849 --> 00:01:15.849
If you look at the study note, it says it can mean encouraged together or comforted mutually.

00:01:15.849 --> 00:01:20.849
You see the interchange, we receive encouragement, we give encouragement.

00:01:20.849 --> 00:01:24.849
There's an interchange between us.

00:01:24.849 --> 00:01:28.849
Then it says by one another's faith, both yours and mine.

00:01:28.849 --> 00:01:31.849
Why does Paul mention faith?

00:01:31.849 --> 00:01:39.849
Well, faith is an expression evidence that we believe in Jehovah.

00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:42.849
We believe that Jehovah knows us, that Jehovah cares about us,

00:01:42.849 --> 00:01:47.849
and that Jehovah will fulfill every single promise that he has made.

00:01:47.849 --> 00:01:51.849
When we share this with one another, that is very encouraging.

00:01:51.849 --> 00:01:57.849
Notice in verse 11, it says that we may impart some spiritual gift.

00:01:57.849 --> 00:02:06.849
It means that we give it some thought, we plan, we think about this and share the spiritual gift.

00:02:06.849 --> 00:02:11.849
It says in order for you to be made firm, these are the things that make us firm,

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:17.849
make us determined, make us sure that we will continue on the course to life.

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:23.849
This makes us think of the words of Jesus in John chapter 13.

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:29.849
And we would like to read verse 34, John 13, 34.

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:37.849
Jesus says, I'm giving you a new commandment, that you love one another.

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:41.849
Just as I have loved you, you also love one another.

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:45.849
Do you see the interchange there? Love one another.

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:51.849
But then he says, just as I have loved you, what does that mean?

00:02:51.849 --> 00:03:00.849
Well, Jesus was willing to give His life for our everlasting well-being.

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:11.849
We can imitate Jesus by placing the everlasting well-being of our brothers ahead of our own desires,

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:15.849
of our own plans, our own arrangements.

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:20.849
So the focus is that we want to help others.

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:22.849
The focus is away from ourselves.

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:27.849
We're not so wrapped up in our own pain, suffering and circumstances,

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:31.849
but we think of others, we think out to others to strengthen them

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:34.849
and to share courage and the resolve to continue.

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:44.539
So the reality is, we are part of something much larger than ourselves.

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:51.539
And this command of Jesus is really our life's work to love one another

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:56.539
and to encourage each other to obey the law of the Christ.

00:03:56.539 --> 00:04:01.539
Let's briefly have a look at the example of the early Christian congregation

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:03.539
and how they encouraged one another.

00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:06.539
And we start off at Pentecost.

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:08.539
They're in Jerusalem.

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:15.539
They are Jews and proselytes from Ethiopia, Egypt, Libya,

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:27.540
Pazia, media, Mesopotamia, Rome, Greece, Crete, Arabia, Macedonia, Galatia,

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.540
and 3,000 were baptized on that day.

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:34.540
And quickly the number grew to 5,000.

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:39.540
These spirit-annoyed Christians went back to their home countries

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:45.540
for this command of Jesus, burning in their hearts to have love for one another.

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:52.050
Now at the direction of Jesus, the governing body in Jerusalem,

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:56.050
might strenuous efforts to encourage these brothers.

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:02.050
We turn you to Acts 15 and you're in Acts 15.

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:09.050
They wrote a beautiful letter to the brothers in Antioch, Syria, and Silesia.

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:13.050
And we pick up the reading from verse 25.

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:16.050
Here is what they said in the letter.

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:22.050
We have come to a unanimous decision to choose men to send to you,

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:29.050
together with our beloved Barnabas and Paul, men who have given up their lives

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:33.050
for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:36.490
Look at the results.

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:41.490
If we just turn back a little bit there to verse 31,

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:47.220
and this is what happened in Antioch, after reading it,

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:51.220
they rejoiced over the encouragement.

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:57.220
And Judas and Siles, since they were also prophets, encouraged the brothers

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:01.220
with many talks and strengthened them.

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:08.529
Now this encouragement did not only come from the governing body.

00:06:08.529 --> 00:06:14.529
These early disciples spurred andointed individuals

00:06:14.529 --> 00:06:20.529
understood their responsibility to be encouraging toward each other.

00:06:20.529 --> 00:06:27.779
Let us for an example look at Acts 14, Acts 14.

00:06:27.779 --> 00:06:38.339
From verse 19 it describes that Paul was stoned and dragged outside the city.

00:06:38.339 --> 00:06:43.939
This is in Listera. Now we read from verse 20.

00:06:43.939 --> 00:06:49.939
However, when the disciples surrounded him, he got up and entered the city.

00:06:49.939 --> 00:06:52.939
On the next day he left with Barnabas for Derby.

00:06:52.939 --> 00:06:57.939
After declaring the good news to that city and making quite a few disciples,

00:06:57.939 --> 00:07:02.939
they returned to Listera, Iconium, and Antioch.

00:07:02.939 --> 00:07:08.939
There they strengthened the disciples, encouraging them to remain in the faith

00:07:08.939 --> 00:07:13.939
and saying we must enter into the kingdom of God through many tribulations.

00:07:13.939 --> 00:07:20.860
There were quite a few brothers associated with Paul and with all those congregations.

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:23.860
We do not know how many.

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:29.860
But if you look at this list, there's a list of 100 names compiled

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:33.860
from only Paul's letters, individuals that he mentioned.

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:38.860
These fellow workers had intense love for one another

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:42.860
and they cooperated, they encouraged one another,

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:46.860
and they stayed faithful and loyal to Jehovah.

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:54.860
Another example is the example of Paul when he was taken as a prisoner from Caesarea to Rome.

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:58.860
Please turn your to Acts chapter 28.

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:06.860
Now in Acts 28, we know that Paul traveled from Malta to Rome.

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:11.860
And as it says there, verse 13, the second part of verse 13,

00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:15.860
we made it to put your lie on the second day.

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:23.860
And then he says, here we found brothers and were urged to remain with them for seven days.

00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:31.860
What hospitality, what kindness, how encouraging that must have been for the Apostle Paul.

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:38.860
There, and put your lie, Paul then sent a message to the brothers in Rome.

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:41.860
Look at their reaction verse 15.

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:46.860
From there, that is from Rome, the brothers, when they heard the news about us,

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:52.860
came as far as the marketplace of Appiars and three taverns to meet us.

00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:55.860
Can you imagine what they did?

00:08:55.860 --> 00:09:05.860
They traveled from Rome for 30 miles by foot to meet Paul as he was traveling towards them

00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:08.860
under escort as a prisoner.

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:13.860
And Paul's reaction at the end of verse 15, on catching sight of them,

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:17.860
Paul thanked God and took courage.

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:23.860
About two years later, Paul wrote to the Hebrews in Judea,

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:26.860
a verse of our theme discussion.

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:32.860
He said that we must encourage one another as we see the day drawing near.

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:38.860
Within just five years, Jerusalem was surrounded by armies.

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:42.860
So Paul urged them to keep on encouraging one another,

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:47.860
to focus on the welfare of each other and not upon all the issues of the day

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:51.860
with the Jews, the Romans, the Pharisees, or whoever.

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:54.860
We slice ahead for us personally.

00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:57.860
We do not know how close we are to the end.

00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:01.860
We do not know what troubles we may be experiencing in the meantime.

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:06.860
But one thing is sure, we will encourage one another.

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:08.860
We will take care of each other.

00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:11.860
We will not forsake our meeting together.

00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:15.860
Meetings give us strength, they give us a spur of Jehovah.

00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:19.860
So always be sure to encourage.

00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:22.860
Commend, don't criticize.

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:27.860
Comfort one another, urge one another, and not to give up.

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:30.860
In that way, we will fulfill the command of Jesus,

00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:35.860
to love one another just as I have loved you.
