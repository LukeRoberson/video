00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:09.779
Before I started pioneering, I was really nervous that I wouldn't be able to get my

00:00:09.779 --> 00:00:10.939
time in every month.

00:00:10.939 --> 00:00:15.460
It was a bit hard when I started pioneering because I didn't have a car.

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:18.620
My boss, he didn't give me part-time work.

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:23.300
I found it really hard to balance schoolwork and pioneering at the same time.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.219
My biggest struggle was fear of man, so that really hindered me because I wasn't very

00:00:27.219 --> 00:00:29.140
good at talking to people.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.420
Having a good routine was a struggle.

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.780
My brother and I are the only ones in the truth.

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.500
My family didn't understand why we wanted to go preaching.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.100
I didn't think that I'd make a good pioneer.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.780
I've had type 1 diabetes since I was 5, so I was always worried about whether or not

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.539
I could balance that health condition with the pioneering.

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:57.460
Challenges don't seem that big now, but back at that time there were a really big deal,

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.460
but the coolest thing was how would you help me?

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.340
Prior to Jehovah helped me overcome my fears.

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:08.579
My family were a massive help from Jehovah because my dad was the one who first encouraged

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:09.900
me to pioneer.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.780
When I did start pioneering, I hit promise that I would have the full support of my family.

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.620
When I spoke to brothers and sisters who spent their youth in the full-time service,

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:24.379
that really helped me because it was really encouraging and it really motivated me to

00:01:24.379 --> 00:01:29.299
want to make my own memories and my own experiences in the full-time service.

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:31.140
They were practical things I could do.

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.540
I didn't have a car.

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.659
I just walked or I caught the bus.

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:38.900
I had to work out what my priorities were first, so I had to find out how many hours

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.340
did I have to go missing every week, so then I just sat down and I looked at every day

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.340
and planned out which days I could go missing, which days I had to go to school and also

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.379
allocate time so that I could do my homework and study.

00:01:50.379 --> 00:01:54.060
Having a schedule was really good because I could see it all out in front of me and

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.060
I could see that the hour requirement was actually attainable, so that made it a lot

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.060
less daunting.

00:01:59.379 --> 00:02:03.819
I first set short-term goals of pioneering and especially months of activity.

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:09.740
Then I was able to begin continuous auxiliary and then eventually I started regular pioneering.

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:15.139
One of the best things I did to prepare myself for pioneering was to auxiliary pioneer beforehand.

00:02:15.139 --> 00:02:20.979
It really set me up to be able to overcome any challenges that I faced while I was pioneering.

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:23.379
I thought about Melika R310.

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:28.139
I knew I trusted in Jehovah but this was my chance to test him out.

00:02:28.139 --> 00:02:32.819
I trained, put my trust in Jehovah and put my application in.

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:38.580
After my form was in for pioneering a brother with time, a brother called me and I put him in work.

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:46.139
I had unemployment for three months which wasn't a good time but during that time I had

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:51.500
Jehovah as my main focus and so he supported me and he didn't let me down.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.539
Asking brothers and sisters to come and work with me maybe on days that I knew that

00:02:55.539 --> 00:03:00.340
I wouldn't get as much support really helped, that helped me to organise my hours a little

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.460
bit more and also I'd get to know my brothers and sisters more as well.

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:09.939
One of the greatest joys of pioneering has been to Pioneer with Mum and we had the privilege

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:14.620
of going to the Pioneer School together which was really special.

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.580
Sam 16-Lasid reminds me that Jehovah is right beside me.

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:23.860
When I'm preaching, it's like Jehovah is holding my hand.

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:29.539
So with full time of service, I love making Jehovah happy with everything he's given me

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:32.139
and finally able to give something back.

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:34.819
Looking back, pioneering it was the best decision I've ever made.

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:39.500
It's opened up so many different avenues of service to Jehovah and it helped me also to

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.979
have that real desire to want to stay in full time service.

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:49.340
Helping someone on the road to everlasting life is the best feeling ever and it's really

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.620
a replacement.

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.620
The only thing I can say, as a young person, start pioneering.
