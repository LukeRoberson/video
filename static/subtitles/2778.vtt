00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:14.580
With so much to do in our life, not just in the ministry but also with secular work, family responsibilities for some even health issues, we can get into a rut.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:22.579
It's not always easy to detect it first, because in this age of technology, we always feel busy.

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:25.579
But what consumes our day?

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:32.579
Watch this one minute video and try to detect what's going on in the life of one brother.

00:00:32.579 --> 00:01:10.299
His life is in a rut. Try to figure out why.

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:54.579
Would you say that this brother's life is in a rut?

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:58.579
Oh, he's active all day. He always has something to do.

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:03.579
But it says if his mind has been kidnapped by his devices.

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:09.580
Have you ever had the experience of reading an email while someone is trying to tell you something?

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:18.580
It can be embarrassing when you realize that they've asked you a question and they're waiting for an answer, but you have no idea what they asked.

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.580
It's embarrassing, right?

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:26.580
But what if the person who is trying to speak to you is Jehovah?

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:38.580
Even though we aren't doing anything wrong, our daily routine can occupy our attention so much that we are not able to hear the refreshing words of Jehovah.
