00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:06.809
Thank you for joining us on this update on the legal situation in Russia.

00:00:06.809 --> 00:00:30.960
Our report will discuss the latest developments after an important court decision on January 16th.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.960
For some time, the Russian government has claimed that Jehovah's Witnesses are extremists.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:44.960
Last year, the prosecutor general issued a warning for extremist activity against the administrative center of Jehovah's Witnesses in Russia,

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.960
which is our branch office.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.960
We appealed that warning as we have not been engaged in any extremist activity.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.960
But on January 16th of this year, the Moscow City Court dismissed that appeal.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:05.959
The three-judge panel rejected all arguments filed by our attorneys and rendered its decision after a ten-minute recess.

00:01:05.959 --> 00:01:11.959
Now, we don't know what the implications of the decision will be, but we do know that in the past,

00:01:11.959 --> 00:01:19.959
when warnings have been issued in Russia against some of our local entities, our property has later been seized.

00:01:19.959 --> 00:01:25.959
Despite the outcome, the January 16th court hearing provided a great witness.

00:01:25.959 --> 00:01:38.959
Our representatives were given the opportunity to present evidence showing that certain Russian officials have been running a campaign of painting us as an extremist organization.

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:44.959
Additionally, our brothers highlighted the peace that exists among Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:51.959
We now have brother Sergei Cheripanov with us live from the administrative center in Russia.

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:57.959
Now, Sergei, what does this recent court decision really mean?

00:01:57.959 --> 00:02:01.959
What the government chooses to do now, we don't know.

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:06.959
But what we do know is that our brothers will continue worshipping Jehovah.

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:13.960
They will go to the meetings, they will go to the field ministry, and keep up with their spiritual routine.

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:19.960
Whatever future may bring, we know that worshipping Jehovah will continue in Russia.

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:31.960
And of course, we have done everything possible, and we will continue doing so, that is to legally defend our right to worship Jehovah freely in Russia.

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:39.960
But we have to understand that we cannot expect perfect justice in this world of injustice.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:45.960
We're considering the groundless accusations that are being made against Jehovah's people in Russia.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.960
How did the brothers and sisters react? Are they better?

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.960
No, not at all.

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:55.960
Well, our brothers continue to be in subjection to their authorities.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:00.960
We respect their authorities, and we understand that not all of them are against us.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:12.960
But just like Paul admonished and his first letter to Timothy, chapter 2, verses 1 and 2, we pray for them so that they will understand the nature of our work.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:19.960
And we would be able to continue our calm and quiet life with the complete godly devotion.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.960
That's a wonderful attitude to have.

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:28.960
What is the message that the brothers and sisters in Russia would like to convey to our worldwide brotherhood?

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:35.960
Well, brothers, you don't need to be overly worried about us, but please keep us in your prayers.

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:42.960
We certainly will, Sergei, and please convey our love to all the brothers and sisters there in Russia.

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.960
We will. Thank you very much.

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:53.960
Although the legal case is currently focused on the administrative center in Russia, how did we get to where we are today?

00:03:53.960 --> 00:04:11.300
To understand the background, we need to go back to 2015 when a city court ruled on allegations against Jehovah's Witnesses in the city of Teginrog, Russia.

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:23.699
On November 30, 2015, the Tagenrog city court convicted 16 Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:29.699
And in March of the next year, the Rostov Regional Court confirmed this decision.

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:40.699
I was hoping that the arguments by the defense and statements of the accused would be heard by the judicial chamber, and we would be excused, but neither were heard at that time.

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:43.699
So on what are the charges of extremism based?

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:51.699
The first step taken by the authorities was to get several publications of Jehovah's Witnesses added to the federal list of extremist materials.

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:58.699
It means that importing these publications into the country, storing them in their places of worship, and distributing them was prohibited.

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:10.699
The basic reasons to ban these publications were based on statements which alleged that they incite religious discord by pointing out the superiority of Jehovah's Witnesses over all other religions.

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:17.699
Following that logic, the courts have pronounced extremist over 80 publications of Jehovah's Witnesses and their official website.

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:24.699
Not surprisingly, many specialists in the field of human rights consider the court decisions erroneous.

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:30.699
If I say that my faith is the right one, it is the only true religion.

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:39.699
What would that mean? Is it advocating exclusivity or inferiority or supremacy? No, of course not.

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:44.699
Jehovah's Witnesses stopped using these publications and removed them from their places of worship.

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:50.699
Despite this, the authorities moved on to the second stage of their persecution.

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:55.699
Over all years, law enforcement officers have repeatedly used the following scenario.

00:05:55.699 --> 00:06:00.699
A third party plants banned literature at the place of worship of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:06:00.699 --> 00:06:06.699
A few minutes later, police officers and prosecutors show up to inspect and search the building.

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:10.699
And as if by chance, find planted publications.

00:06:10.699 --> 00:06:15.699
And all this is done just to accuse believers of extremism and to ban their activity.

00:06:15.699 --> 00:06:23.699
As a result of such literature plantings, the authorities have succeeded in liquidating seven local entities of Jehovah's Witnesses in different cities of Russia.

00:06:23.699 --> 00:06:26.699
This was the third step of the persecution.

00:06:26.699 --> 00:06:34.699
It is important to understand that a local religious organization of Jehovah's Witnesses or LRO is not the same thing as a congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:06:34.699 --> 00:06:41.699
An LRO includes 10 to 15 believers and has certain rights, such as to own and maintain a religious building.

00:06:41.699 --> 00:06:47.699
The actual activities relating to their worship is carried out by the believers independently of the LRO.

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:50.699
And at last, the authorities moved on to their main goal.

00:06:50.699 --> 00:06:59.699
With reference to the fact that local entities had been banned, the prosecutor's office now expressed its readiness to ban the headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses in Russia.

00:06:59.699 --> 00:07:03.699
Prior to this, the prosecutor's office had already initiated several inspections.

00:07:03.699 --> 00:07:10.699
Then in 2013, a team of approximately 60 officials turned up at the administrative center to inspect it.

00:07:10.699 --> 00:07:14.699
However, despite all their efforts, nothing unlawful was found.

00:07:14.699 --> 00:07:20.699
Such events remind many human rights advocates of the days of religious repression in the past.

00:07:20.699 --> 00:07:25.699
I've known about Jehovah's Witnesses for many years.

00:07:25.699 --> 00:07:36.699
During Soviet times, they were persecuted for their faith and received long sentences in prison camps.

00:07:37.699 --> 00:07:46.699
They would go to prison for their faith, such sincere feelings call for respect.

00:07:46.699 --> 00:07:51.699
Partful faith excludes extremism.

00:07:51.699 --> 00:07:56.699
Although Jehovah's Witnesses in Russia are going through certain difficulties,

00:07:56.699 --> 00:08:01.699
today our brothers and sisters continue to serve Jehovah with great joy and zeal.

00:08:02.699 --> 00:08:09.699
We are also receiving words of support from our brothers and sisters all around the world.

00:08:09.699 --> 00:08:17.699
During this difficult time of persecution, I have received a lot of help from our brothers and sisters.

00:08:17.699 --> 00:08:24.699
Recently, one brother from New Zealand wrote that his six-year-old son is praying for me every night.

00:08:24.699 --> 00:08:28.699
It was a great encouragement.

00:08:28.699 --> 00:08:33.700
And of course, we remember one family who sent his greetings from France.

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:38.700
Nine people, seven of them were children. That's something.

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:43.700
My relationship with Jehovah is only getting stronger through all of this.

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:50.700
During any trial, I try to get to know him better, understand him, and it strengthens our relationship.

00:08:51.700 --> 00:09:04.700
Brothers, in jaw difficulties, stand firm in the faith and blessings from Jehovah will come.

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:08.700
Our brothers in Russia have gone through a lot in the past few years.

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:15.700
King Hezekiah experienced something similar as you may remember from last year's regional convention drama.

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:19.700
Jehovah said in Isaiah, chapter 30, verse 15,

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:25.700
your strength will be in keeping calm and showing trust.

00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:30.700
Now, Hezekiah trusted in Jehovah and Jehovah proved to be with him.

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:36.700
But how can we remain calm when negative things take place around us?

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:42.700
Well, first, we trust that Jehovah will care for us no matter what happens.

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:46.700
We know that He's pleased by our faith and courage.

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:54.700
Second, we know that all we're asking for is to be able to worship Jehovah in love and peace.

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:59.700
Our neutral peace-loving stand is known around the world.

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:04.700
And third, our worldwide brotherhood stands with us.

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:11.700
Brothers and sisters in Russia, your trust in Jehovah is a great example for all of us to imitate.

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:17.700
Please know that we are praying in your behalf because we love you very much.

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:24.700
There's no doubt that Jehovah is on your side and He will continue to guide and protect you.

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:30.700
