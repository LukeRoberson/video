00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.690
Welcome, brothers and sisters.

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:06.690
Here are some of this month's highlights.

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.689
How should we view counsel?

00:00:09.689 --> 00:00:13.689
Does it apply to us, even if we don't like the way it was given?

00:00:13.689 --> 00:00:20.690
In times of crisis, how does the organization respond to help our brothers and sisters?

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:27.690
And we will go behind the scenes of last year's convention drama about King Hezekiah.

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:50.859
This is the May program of JW Broadcasting.

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:54.859
Let's begin by visiting a family in Stockholm, Sweden.

00:00:54.859 --> 00:00:58.859
The parents of Sama and Christina have two daughters,

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.859
Talita and Isabella.

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.859
When Talita was born, the doctor found cataracts in both of her eyes.

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:11.859
A cataract is a clouding of the eyes' natural lens.

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:16.859
So the doctor had to operate so that Talita wouldn't lose her sight completely,

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:20.859
a terrifying situation for any parent.

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:28.859
Today, Talita is seven years old and almost blind in one eye, but completely blind in the other.

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:32.859
Teaching a child about Jehovah and the system of things is already a challenge,

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:36.859
even without physical ailments involved.

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:41.859
But let's find out how Talita's parents rose to the challenge,

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:47.859
making sure that she received a proper spiritual education despite her poor vision.

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:56.040
I look forward to not having poor sight anymore,

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:03.040
and that I can play with a bear and a lion and just sit on the back of a tiger.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:09.039
Jehovah gives us a fantastic promise in Isaiah 35-5.

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:13.039
The eyes of the blind will be opened.

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:17.039
It's been a challenge to get to where we are today,

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:21.039
with thanks Jehovah for all the help he has given us.

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:25.039
As soon as Talita was able to leave the house after operation,

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:28.039
we made sure to go to the meetings.

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:34.379
It helped us a lot to be able to throw our burden on Jehovah.

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:39.379
We prayed together, we cried a lot together because it was so hard.

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:49.409
One of the challenges is that we have to give Talita audio description constantly.

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:54.409
We have to tell her who is coming in and what is happening.

00:02:54.409 --> 00:03:02.409
We get so many amazing materials on jw.org and also through the congregation.

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:07.409
She really loves to read, learn from the great teacher.

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:11.409
It has questions which make her a part of the story.

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:18.710
She has a very good memory and therefore she remembers a lot of what she reads.

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:22.710
So when we are with friends, she often quizzes them.

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:41.210
You see, you see how you think.

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:46.210
You just discard your own, okay, then I'll do you that.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:56.419
I really like to sing the songs in my song book.

00:03:56.419 --> 00:04:03.590
Talita's spiritual goal is to learn more of our kingdom songs.

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:09.349
We get so much help from the beautiful music on the website

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:13.349
and also from the Caleb and Sophia videos.

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:18.790
She knows many of the stories from my book of Bible stories

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:21.790
so she can answer in her own words.

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:24.790
We will ask the question like, do you know this about David?

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:29.790
And if she knows the answer, then we encourage her to answer at the meeting.

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:42.790
When I give an answer at the meetings, Jehovah becomes happy because he loves children.

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:46.790
She often asks the friends, do you love Jehovah?

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:52.129
So she feels very united with them.

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:58.129
One of the best moments where we saw that Talita's spirituality had grown

00:04:58.129 --> 00:05:02.129
was when she came home from a sleepover at her grandparents' house.

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:05.129
My parents are not Jehovah's Witnesses

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:08.129
and her grandmother had said that God doesn't exist.

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:11.129
So when Talita came home, she said,

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:14.129
and then when I was going to sleep, I prayed to Jehovah.

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:19.129
Would you please help grandmother to realise that you do exist, that you are real?

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:23.050
The fantasies go up but we are high.

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:27.050
We try to keep our wonderful hope and life.

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:32.050
So we often talk about what we will do in paradise.

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:36.050
We really look forward to when Talita will be able to see again

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:39.050
living in a paradise with all our friends.

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:41.050
It's going to be wonderful.

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:47.990
I think that Jehovah looks forward to looking at me when I play with a tiger.

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:56.449
I'll have to make sure that I remember the names of Joseph's brothers

00:05:56.449 --> 00:06:00.449
in case I meet Talita and she decides to quiz me.

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:05.449
Her parents have done a good job in raising such a fine young sister.

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:11.449
And together with them, we eagerly look forward to the benefits of the new system.

00:06:11.449 --> 00:06:14.449
Isaiah 35-5 says,

00:06:14.449 --> 00:06:19.449
at that time, the eyes of the blind will be opened.

00:06:20.449 --> 00:06:24.449
Such divine reminders can truly warm our heart.

00:06:24.449 --> 00:06:28.449
And Jehovah's Reminders not only provide us comfort,

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:33.449
but can also help us make important decisions in our everyday life.

00:06:33.449 --> 00:06:37.449
This brings us to our music video, which is entitled,

00:06:37.449 --> 00:06:56.959
I Keep Your Reminders.

00:08:41.019 --> 00:10:36.629
Did you notice that it was a Bible-trained conscience

00:10:36.629 --> 00:10:39.629
that helped our sister make a wise decision?

00:10:39.629 --> 00:10:43.629
She knew what potential danger lay ahead.

00:10:43.629 --> 00:10:47.629
Yes, the reminders from God's Word guided her.

00:10:47.629 --> 00:10:50.629
The theme for our program this month is,

00:10:50.629 --> 00:10:53.629
Treasure Jehovah's Reminders.

00:10:53.629 --> 00:10:58.629
And it's based on Psalm 19.7,

00:10:58.629 --> 00:11:00.629
where we're told,

00:11:00.629 --> 00:11:04.629
the reminder of Jehovah is trustworthy,

00:11:04.629 --> 00:11:08.629
making the inexperienced one wise.

00:11:08.629 --> 00:11:13.629
In the original language, the word here translated as reminder

00:11:13.629 --> 00:11:18.629
comes from a root word meaning to go over again to repeat.

00:11:18.629 --> 00:11:23.629
Reminders have always been an essential part of Jehovah's teaching.

00:11:23.629 --> 00:11:28.629
In ancient Israel, God's people continually received commandments,

00:11:28.629 --> 00:11:31.629
regulations, and reminders.

00:11:31.629 --> 00:11:36.629
In fact, Jehovah tells us that he sent his prophets again and again

00:11:36.629 --> 00:11:41.629
to repeatedly remind his people of their responsibilities.

00:11:41.629 --> 00:11:44.629
The Apostle Peter felt the need to give reminders

00:11:44.629 --> 00:11:48.629
even to those who were well established in the truth.

00:11:48.629 --> 00:11:54.629
Notice how he describes this as second Peter 1, 12 and 13.

00:11:54.629 --> 00:12:00.629
For this reason, I intend always to remind you of these things,

00:12:00.629 --> 00:12:03.629
although you know them, and are well established in the truth

00:12:03.629 --> 00:12:05.629
that is present in you.

00:12:05.629 --> 00:12:09.629
But I consider it right as long as I'm in this tabernacle,

00:12:09.629 --> 00:12:13.629
to stir you with reminders.

00:12:13.629 --> 00:12:17.629
In verse 15, he goes on to give the reason why he felt the need

00:12:17.629 --> 00:12:19.629
to give the brothers reminders.

00:12:19.629 --> 00:12:21.629
He says,

00:12:21.629 --> 00:12:26.629
I will always do my utmost so that after my departure,

00:12:26.629 --> 00:12:31.629
you may be able to recall these things for yourselves.

00:12:31.629 --> 00:12:35.629
So Peter was determined to help the brothers and sisters in his day

00:12:35.629 --> 00:12:40.629
to remember or recall the teachings they had already learned.

00:12:40.629 --> 00:12:44.629
It shouldn't come as a surprise then if today a lot of our teaching

00:12:44.629 --> 00:12:46.629
involves reminders.

00:12:46.629 --> 00:12:50.629
It follows the pattern set by Jehovah in ancient Israel

00:12:50.629 --> 00:12:53.629
and with the first century Christians.

00:12:53.629 --> 00:12:56.629
But why do we need reminders?

00:12:56.629 --> 00:12:59.629
Let's consider three reasons.

00:12:59.629 --> 00:13:04.629
First, let's look at Psalm 103 verse 2.

00:13:04.629 --> 00:13:05.629
There it says,

00:13:05.629 --> 00:13:08.629
Let me praise Jehovah.

00:13:08.629 --> 00:13:11.629
May I never forget all that he has done.

00:13:11.629 --> 00:13:14.629
Why then do we need reminders?

00:13:14.629 --> 00:13:17.629
Simply put, because we forget.

00:13:17.629 --> 00:13:22.629
If we had perfect memories, we wouldn't need so many reminders.

00:13:22.629 --> 00:13:26.629
Even in everyday life, many of us use little nuts to remind ourselves

00:13:26.629 --> 00:13:28.629
of what we need to do.

00:13:28.629 --> 00:13:33.629
And who of us hasn't seen the need for a list of reminders when going shopping?

00:13:33.629 --> 00:13:41.629
Only to realize when we return that we forgot to get one of the important items we needed to purchase.

00:13:41.629 --> 00:13:49.629
If reminders are important in everyday life, how much more so in matters that involve our relationship with Jehovah?

00:13:49.629 --> 00:13:54.629
Let's read Luke 10 verses 39 and 40.

00:13:54.629 --> 00:13:57.629
Speaking of Martha, we are told,

00:13:57.629 --> 00:14:00.629
she also had a sister called Mary,

00:14:00.629 --> 00:14:05.629
who sat down at the feet of the Lord and kept listening to what he was saying.

00:14:05.629 --> 00:14:11.629
Martha, on the other hand, was distracted with attending to many duties.

00:14:11.629 --> 00:14:14.629
What was Martha's problem?

00:14:14.629 --> 00:14:16.629
She was distracted.

00:14:16.629 --> 00:14:24.629
So the second reason why we need reminders is that like Martha, at times we too become distracted.

00:14:24.629 --> 00:14:27.629
Although we may already know a vital fact,

00:14:27.629 --> 00:14:31.629
that fact might get put into the back of our mind figuratively speaking,

00:14:31.629 --> 00:14:35.629
because other matters are demanding her attention.

00:14:35.629 --> 00:14:38.629
Satan is the great distractor.

00:14:38.629 --> 00:14:43.629
He tries to turn our attention away from the true issues of our day.

00:14:43.629 --> 00:14:51.629
People in general have become more and more distracted by entertainment and other non-essential matters.

00:14:51.629 --> 00:14:55.629
No wonder that Satan has succeeded in misleading so many.

00:14:55.629 --> 00:14:59.629
They don't even realize what has happened.

00:14:59.629 --> 00:15:06.629
Reason number three is alluded to at Matthew 24 verse 45.

00:15:06.629 --> 00:15:09.629
Who really is the faithful and discrete slave?

00:15:09.629 --> 00:15:16.629
Who is master appointed over his domestics to give them their food at the proper time?

00:15:16.629 --> 00:15:21.629
Notice that the spiritual food is given to us at the proper time.

00:15:21.629 --> 00:15:25.629
Our circumstances in life are continually changing.

00:15:25.629 --> 00:15:29.629
How often do we hear that was just what I needed?

00:15:29.629 --> 00:15:32.629
We've all experienced that haven't we?

00:15:32.629 --> 00:15:36.629
So what are three of the reasons why we need reminders?

00:15:36.629 --> 00:15:39.629
One, because we tend to forget things.

00:15:39.629 --> 00:15:43.629
Two, we often become distracted.

00:15:43.629 --> 00:15:50.629
Three, our changed circumstances may require a reminder of something we already knew

00:15:50.629 --> 00:15:53.629
but didn't fully need at that time.

00:15:53.629 --> 00:15:56.629
So that brings us to the next question.

00:15:56.629 --> 00:15:59.629
What will help us to remember?

00:15:59.629 --> 00:16:06.629
It's interesting to note that Jehovah has used many ways to remind his people of what they should do.

00:16:06.629 --> 00:16:13.629
At numbers chapter 10 verse 10, we're told that the various festivals were given as reminders,

00:16:13.629 --> 00:16:17.629
especially the celebration of the Passover.

00:16:17.629 --> 00:16:22.629
That means that every time the Israelites prepared and celebrated one of these festivals,

00:16:23.629 --> 00:16:29.629
they were reminded of important matters such as how Jehovah provides for his people

00:16:29.629 --> 00:16:32.629
and how he has saved them in the past.

00:16:32.629 --> 00:16:37.629
Something similar happens today at the commemoration of the Lord's Eve, the meal.

00:16:37.629 --> 00:16:41.629
Not only do we hear the reminders from God's Word,

00:16:41.629 --> 00:16:47.629
but the act of passing the bread and wine also serves as an action that reminds us

00:16:47.629 --> 00:16:51.629
of what Jesus did in our behalf.

00:16:51.629 --> 00:16:57.629
But what do we need to do in order for those reminders to have a beneficial impact on our lives?

00:16:57.629 --> 00:17:03.629
Notice what Psalm 119 verse 99 says.

00:17:03.629 --> 00:17:12.630
It tells us, I have more insight than all my teachers because I ponder over your reminders.

00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:15.630
Yes, we need to ponder over these reminders.

00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:19.630
That means not just listening to or reading them,

00:17:19.630 --> 00:17:24.630
but it involves thinking deeply about them, meditating on their value.

00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:30.630
Just to listen or read without meditating is like looking through the lens of a movie camera

00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:33.630
without pressing the record button.

00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:38.630
We see things and hear things, but nothing is recorded.

00:17:39.630 --> 00:17:45.630
So we need to meditate, visualize and review these reminders.

00:17:45.630 --> 00:17:48.630
This will help us to remember what we learn.

00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:55.630
But figuratively speaking, there is something else that we can do to press the record button.

00:17:55.630 --> 00:18:00.630
That means we don't have to wait for someone else to give us a reminder.

00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:03.630
We can make our own reminder.

00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:06.630
How can we do so?

00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:14.630
The answer to that question is highlighted in Jehovah's instructions to Moses as found at Exodus 1714.

00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:17.630
Jehovah now said to Moses,

00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:25.630
write this as a memorial, or the footnote says, reminder in the book and repeat it to Joshua.

00:18:25.630 --> 00:18:27.630
What's the point?

00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:31.630
Write down new things we want to remember.

00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:38.630
Some brothers use a notebook or exercise book to write down a list of interesting points that they want to remember.

00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:44.630
Then they look through the book from time to time to remind themselves of those points.

00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:49.630
Many of us do this with our notes from conventions and assemblies.

00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:54.630
Of course to do that successfully, you need to remember where you put the notebook.

00:18:54.630 --> 00:19:00.630
Additionally, we have to be careful that we don't write down every little fact.

00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:05.630
Otherwise, we may become overwhelmed with all the information.

00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:13.630
We can make these notes either on paper or electronically using computers or electronic devices.

00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:20.630
Whatever system we use, let's make lists of things that we want to remember.

00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:25.630
Many brothers have found it good to have two separate lists.

00:19:25.630 --> 00:19:32.630
One list could be subjects, perhaps points that we want to use in the ministry or in our own lives.

00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:39.630
Another, scriptures, explanations that clarify the meaning of certain verses.

00:19:39.630 --> 00:19:45.630
With regard to notes on scriptures, let's ask a very important question.

00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:49.630
Do you have a study Bible?

00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:52.630
What is a study Bible?

00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:56.630
Perhaps it's a separate Bible to the one you take in the ministry.

00:19:56.630 --> 00:20:02.630
It's a Bible for you to write in so that you're reminded of things that you've learned.

00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:06.630
These are some of the things we can do with a study Bible.

00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:10.630
Highlight or underline some words or verses.

00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:13.630
That will make it easier to find them again.

00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:19.630
But remember, not to make too many highlights or marks, otherwise nothing will stand out.

00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:28.630
Write a summary of points and scriptures you want to remember on the blank pages in the front or the back of your Bible.

00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:33.630
Write notes in the margin. That's what Gilead students often do.

00:20:33.630 --> 00:20:40.630
Of course, you need the right type of pen or pencil that won't bleed through to the other side of the page.

00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:44.630
What type of things could you write in the margin?

00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:50.630
Perhaps new points that you learn while reading magazines or attending meetings and assemblies.

00:20:50.630 --> 00:21:00.630
If you learn a new point, ask yourself what verses being explained and then write a brief comment in the margin next to that verse.

00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:03.630
Let's take an example.

00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:11.630
Perhaps you are reading the sermon on the Mount and you get to Matthew 7 verses 24 through 27.

00:21:11.630 --> 00:21:18.630
That's the illustration about the two men who build houses, one on sand and the other on rock.

00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:24.630
As you research this in Watchtower Library or the Research Guide, you come across the article,

00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:32.630
are you building on sand or on rock in the November 1, 2008 Watchtower?

00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:37.630
What points could you write in the margin to help you remember the explanation?

00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:43.630
Perhaps you could write sand equals build on the surface.

00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:48.630
Rock equals dig down deep.

00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:52.630
Digging equals doing and applying.

00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:56.630
You might even put Luke 6, 46 through 48 there.

00:21:56.630 --> 00:22:02.630
If you still have room and you're writing a small, you could add something like this.

00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:06.630
Not here as only, but doers.

00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:14.630
Both houses in same location, same tests, foundations different.

00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:20.630
Now every time you read those verses, you'll be reminded of what they mean.

00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:25.630
Perhaps like me, you've had several study Bibles over the years.

00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:30.630
I think back to the first one I used, it was like this big green Bible.

00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:36.630
Then later that was replaced by another Bible, this black covered Bible.

00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:42.630
And then further still we had another Bible, the reference Bible.

00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:48.630
And of course now for most of us, we have a large print Bible.

00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:53.630
This does however highlight a challenge we might experience.

00:22:53.630 --> 00:22:57.630
It can be frustrating when a new edition of the Bible comes out.

00:22:57.630 --> 00:23:02.630
How do you transfer all your study notes over to the new Bible?

00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:13.630
Additionally, our beloved study Bible may wear out or will still be lost, stolen, burned, ruined, run over, blown away.

00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:18.630
So that's the advantage of using an electronic list.

00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:23.630
It doesn't matter what type of file you use, it can be updated very easily.

00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:31.630
And you can even make copies, not like the print copy that already has the old idea written in the margin.

00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:42.630
Even now in English, we have the books of Matthew, Mark, and Luke in our electronic study Bible on JW.org and WOL.

00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:49.630
Later in the program, we have some exciting news about how JW Library will help us in this regard.

00:23:49.630 --> 00:23:52.630
But I'll leave that for later.

00:23:52.630 --> 00:24:01.630
Really, having a study Bible is not only helpful, but it also makes our personal study far more interesting.

00:24:01.630 --> 00:24:03.630
How so?

00:24:03.630 --> 00:24:12.630
Every time we read or study a publication, we'll find ourselves searching for new points that we can write in our study Bible.

00:24:13.630 --> 00:24:20.630
This way, we'll be doing what the Psalmist expressed at Psalm 119, verse 111.

00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:31.630
We will take Jehovah's Reminders as our permanent possession or heritage for his reminders are the joy of our hearts.

00:24:31.630 --> 00:24:38.630
But do you agree that sometimes the reminders we get may be less than pleasant?

00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:40.630
Maybe they even hurt.

00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:53.490
In this dramatization, pay attention to how we should respond to counsel.

00:24:59.950 --> 00:25:01.950
Today started out well.

00:25:01.950 --> 00:25:22.289
But after the meeting tonight, my feelings were hurt.

00:25:22.289 --> 00:25:26.289
Earlier in the week, we invited some friends over to watch a movie.

00:25:26.289 --> 00:25:30.289
And apparently, his new young elder heard about it.

00:25:30.289 --> 00:25:37.289
So he counseled me about it after the meeting, saying I should give my movie choices some thought.

00:25:37.289 --> 00:25:41.289
I just didn't like the way he gave the counsel.

00:25:41.289 --> 00:25:43.289
He's only 27th.

00:25:43.289 --> 00:25:45.289
That's too young.

00:25:45.289 --> 00:25:55.470
The next day, we had plans to go out in the ministry with Brother Kong and his wife.

00:25:55.470 --> 00:26:01.390
But the motivation just wasn't there.

00:26:01.390 --> 00:26:16.069
I asked to speak with Brother Kong alone.

00:26:16.069 --> 00:26:22.069
I told him what happened and how we didn't feel the counsel applied to us.

00:26:22.069 --> 00:26:25.069
I can understand how you might feel.

00:26:25.069 --> 00:26:28.069
But be young too. Be absolutely honest with me.

00:26:28.069 --> 00:26:33.069
Do you feel there is no valid reason for that counsel?

00:26:33.069 --> 00:26:46.779
Or maybe there were some scenes that could have been less violent.

00:26:46.779 --> 00:26:50.779
But the way he gave the counsel, he didn't even ask how we felt.

00:26:50.779 --> 00:26:56.779
Young Su, what is the only way for us to receive perfect counsel?

00:26:56.779 --> 00:26:58.779
From a perfect man?

00:26:58.779 --> 00:27:00.779
That's right.

00:27:00.779 --> 00:27:03.779
And is Jesus here on the earth today?

00:27:03.779 --> 00:27:07.019
He was right.

00:27:07.019 --> 00:27:13.019
Counsel can only be perfect if it's given from a perfect person.

00:27:13.019 --> 00:27:20.019
Still, this counsel about our movie choices would have been so much easier.

00:27:20.019 --> 00:27:25.019
If it came from someone older and more experienced like Brother Kong,

00:27:25.019 --> 00:27:30.589
well, he must have sensed what I was thinking.

00:27:30.589 --> 00:27:37.640
Because he helped me to remember something from the Bible.

00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:45.640
When Job underwent severe trials, it was the younger Alayhu who helped Job adjust his thinking correctly.

00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:56.640
It required humility on Job's part to listen to someone younger and less experienced.

00:27:56.640 --> 00:28:00.640
He then read Proverbs chapter 19, verse 20.

00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:07.640
Listen to counsel and accept discipline in order to become wise in your future.

00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:11.980
The point was clear.

00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:30.359
Keep our focus on the counsel, not the counselor.

00:28:30.359 --> 00:28:35.769
I later shared Brother Kong's comments with my wife.

00:28:35.769 --> 00:28:40.769
We both realized we should welcome all counsel from Jehovah.

00:28:41.769 --> 00:29:09.920
I'm sure it took courage for that young elder to approach me about the matter.

00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:12.920
But I'm so glad he did.

00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:19.920
Because in the end, his counsel was just another example of God's love.

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:25.930
Yes, we all need reminders.

00:29:25.930 --> 00:29:29.930
Did you notice some of the main teaching points in this dramatization?

00:29:29.930 --> 00:29:33.930
First, we need to be humble when we receive counsel.

00:29:34.930 --> 00:29:40.930
Second, we need to keep our focus on the counsel, not the counselor.

00:29:40.930 --> 00:29:44.930
And the young elder likely learned from the experience too.

00:29:44.930 --> 00:29:53.930
Perhaps next time, after conferring with the seasoned elder, he might handle matters with a little bit more tact and discretion.

00:29:53.930 --> 00:30:00.930
But we can't rely solely on receiving reminders from others to keep our spirituality intact.

00:30:00.930 --> 00:30:02.930
We need to do our part.

00:30:02.930 --> 00:30:09.930
One of the tools that can help us to actively search out reminders is JW Library.

00:30:09.930 --> 00:30:16.930
This amazing app has been installed on over 15 million devices.

00:30:16.930 --> 00:30:21.930
But do you know how much work it takes to develop and maintain this app?

00:30:21.930 --> 00:30:31.930
Well, we are now going to look behind the scenes and meet some of the brothers who have either worked on this project or helped to organize that work.

00:30:32.930 --> 00:30:39.930
This really is an opportunity to visit an area in Bethel that you don't get to see on tour.

00:30:39.930 --> 00:30:42.930
Of course, there are many brothers associated with the work.

00:30:42.930 --> 00:30:47.930
But we would like you to get to know three of these very hard working brothers.

00:30:47.930 --> 00:30:50.930
And let me introduce them to you.

00:30:50.930 --> 00:30:55.930
First of all, brother Pierre Christiansen, the overseer of MEPS programming.

00:30:55.930 --> 00:30:59.930
Now Pierre, you've been in this country working in the US Bethel for a number of years.

00:30:59.930 --> 00:31:01.930
But where are you from originally?

00:31:01.930 --> 00:31:06.930
I was born in Denmark and served there in the brains for years.

00:31:06.930 --> 00:31:10.930
So when did you and your wife bear it come to the United States?

00:31:10.930 --> 00:31:12.930
In 1994.

00:31:12.930 --> 00:31:14.930
And our first year was in Brooklyn.

00:31:14.930 --> 00:31:20.930
And then we had 18 years in Patterson and then back to Brooklyn again for three and a half year.

00:31:20.930 --> 00:31:24.930
And now we're in Warwick since November last year.

00:31:25.930 --> 00:31:32.930
Well, I know you worked in translation services for a while because in fact the two of us worked together in the same department there for a while.

00:31:32.930 --> 00:31:37.930
But what type of work have you been involved with since you've come to the United States?

00:31:37.930 --> 00:31:43.930
Lots of exciting and challenging jobs and working in translation services.

00:31:43.930 --> 00:31:48.930
That was training and support for our translators worldwide.

00:31:48.930 --> 00:31:55.930
Now in MEPS programming, that is all about distribution of spiritual food to all our brothers and sisters.

00:31:55.930 --> 00:32:00.930
So we have a ton of work and a lot of challenges.

00:32:00.930 --> 00:32:05.930
But I'm also working with a lot of very, very talented brothers and sisters.

00:32:05.930 --> 00:32:10.930
So it's a lot of fun and it's great going to work every day.

00:32:10.930 --> 00:32:12.930
That's great to hear Pierre.

00:32:12.930 --> 00:32:15.930
In fact, I'm even tempted to come back and work with you.

00:32:15.930 --> 00:32:16.930
We would love that.

00:32:16.930 --> 00:32:18.930
I think I'd love it too.

00:32:18.930 --> 00:32:25.930
Well, let's turn our attention to brother Alfredo Son and you're the assistant officer of MEPS programming.

00:32:25.930 --> 00:32:29.930
In fact, you and I worked together in Mexico back in 2003.

00:32:29.930 --> 00:32:33.930
Could you tell us a little bit about what you were doing at that time?

00:32:33.930 --> 00:32:37.930
My last work assignment involved overseeing the large translation department there.

00:32:37.930 --> 00:32:43.930
It was an amazing privilege to work with translators in sign language and the indigenous languages.

00:32:43.930 --> 00:32:49.930
A true joy to contribute to preparing publications for those in the minority groups.

00:32:49.930 --> 00:32:53.930
So when did you and your wife Gina come to the United States to work here?

00:32:53.930 --> 00:32:56.930
We arrived at Patterson in 2007.

00:32:56.930 --> 00:33:00.930
We have fond memories of that time and it's something we still treasure.

00:33:00.930 --> 00:33:03.930
Very good and now brother Paul Willis.

00:33:03.930 --> 00:33:07.930
Where do you originally come from along with your wife, Selin?

00:33:07.930 --> 00:33:10.930
And when did you come to the United States?

00:33:10.930 --> 00:33:15.930
Well, we're both originally from South Africa and we served there in Bethel for a number of years.

00:33:15.930 --> 00:33:20.930
And then in 2010, we were transferred to work along with MEPS programming here in the U.S.

00:33:20.930 --> 00:33:25.930
So what type of work have you been involved with, particularly recently?

00:33:25.930 --> 00:33:30.930
Well, most of my time at Bethel, I've been working on the Watchtower translation system or WTS.

00:33:30.930 --> 00:33:33.930
Actually, I was working along with Pierre.

00:33:33.930 --> 00:33:37.930
Pierre was in headquarters and I was working on the programming team that we had in South Africa.

00:33:37.930 --> 00:33:42.930
WTS is the program that the translators use to help organize and manage their translation work.

00:33:42.930 --> 00:33:49.930
And then of course, most recently, I've been working on the mobile apps, the JW Library app and the JW Library Sign Language app.

00:33:49.930 --> 00:33:53.930
Very good. Well, now all of you work in MEPS programming.

00:33:53.930 --> 00:33:59.930
Pierre, can you just tell us a little bit? We're familiar with the term MEPS, but what really is it?

00:33:59.930 --> 00:34:04.930
Well, MEPS stands for multi-language electronic publishing system.

00:34:04.930 --> 00:34:09.929
That didn't help me at all. Sorry. Can you make it a little bit more simple as I can understand?

00:34:09.929 --> 00:34:16.929
We make the tools or the programs that the organization needs to make publications

00:34:16.929 --> 00:34:21.929
and have them translated into hundreds of languages.

00:34:21.929 --> 00:34:26.929
So I can illustrate it this way that we are not making the spiritual food,

00:34:26.929 --> 00:34:30.929
but we are building a conveyor belt for the spiritual food.

00:34:30.929 --> 00:34:35.929
From the faithful and discreet slave and down to the printing presses,

00:34:35.929 --> 00:34:41.929
or to our website, or to what's our library, online library, or like in this case, JW Library.

00:34:41.929 --> 00:34:47.929
Thanks so much. Now, along last I do understand a bit more about what MEPS means.

00:34:47.929 --> 00:34:53.929
Now, as I travel around, the brothers and sisters, they tell me how much they love JW Library.

00:34:53.929 --> 00:34:59.929
But there seems to be no end to the suggestions for improvements, features,

00:34:59.929 --> 00:35:05.929
long list of suggestions. Can you give us a little bit of an idea of what's involved

00:35:05.929 --> 00:35:10.929
with trying to develop a new feature with JW Library?

00:35:10.929 --> 00:35:13.929
Yes, the brothers and the sisters really love using the app.

00:35:13.929 --> 00:35:17.929
And because of that, they're keen to get many new features.

00:35:17.929 --> 00:35:21.929
Of course, we wish we could just add all those new features into the app,

00:35:21.929 --> 00:35:24.929
but the truth is, we just can't.

00:35:24.929 --> 00:35:28.929
Yes, adding each new feature involves a lot of work.

00:35:28.929 --> 00:35:32.929
And we also need to determine whether a feature that's requested,

00:35:32.929 --> 00:35:36.929
is that just a nice to have, or is it something that's going to address a real need?

00:35:36.929 --> 00:35:40.929
For example, will it really help an elder who's out on a shepherding call,

00:35:40.929 --> 00:35:43.929
or maybe a pioneer sister who's at the public witnessing cards,

00:35:43.929 --> 00:35:46.929
or at a Bible study, or a turn visit?

00:35:46.929 --> 00:35:53.929
Also, very important to us is trying to make each new feature very simple to use.

00:35:53.929 --> 00:35:55.929
Thanks for doing that.

00:35:55.929 --> 00:35:58.929
Especially for a first-time user. Someone has never used the app before.

00:35:58.929 --> 00:36:01.929
And then, of course, before we start working on anything,

00:36:01.929 --> 00:36:03.929
we always get approval from the governing body.

00:36:03.929 --> 00:36:05.929
That's a good thing to do, too.

00:36:05.929 --> 00:36:11.929
One feature that many have been asking for is the ability to add notes into the app.

00:36:12.929 --> 00:36:14.929
And of course, before we start programming it,

00:36:14.929 --> 00:36:17.929
we have to make sure that it actually does what is wanted.

00:36:17.929 --> 00:36:20.929
We have made a video that shows how we go on that.

00:36:20.929 --> 00:36:21.929
Would you like to see it?

00:36:21.929 --> 00:36:24.929
Well, of course, I'd love to see it.

00:36:24.929 --> 00:36:25.929
Hello.

00:36:25.929 --> 00:36:26.929
How are you?

00:36:26.929 --> 00:36:27.929
Good, good, good.

00:36:27.929 --> 00:36:28.929
Thanks for coming.

00:36:28.929 --> 00:36:29.929
Fine, thank you.

00:36:29.929 --> 00:36:30.929
Have a seat.

00:36:30.929 --> 00:36:32.929
Right, so glad you could be here.

00:36:32.929 --> 00:36:33.929
Thank you so much.

00:36:33.929 --> 00:36:34.929
It was all fancy.

00:36:34.929 --> 00:36:37.929
Yeah, so we get to talk about GW Libraries today.

00:36:37.929 --> 00:36:40.929
So, what are some ways that you use GW Library?

00:36:40.929 --> 00:36:43.929
I mean, it's a revolution that is going to meetings.

00:36:43.929 --> 00:36:44.929
Oh, wow.

00:36:44.929 --> 00:36:46.929
I go to meetings sometimes and I just carry my iPad.

00:36:46.929 --> 00:36:49.929
So the fact that you can make this text larger?

00:36:49.929 --> 00:36:52.929
It's easy to listen to the reading right in the app now,

00:36:52.929 --> 00:36:53.929
and so I find myself doing that.

00:36:53.929 --> 00:36:55.929
So, if we were to make a notes feature,

00:36:55.929 --> 00:36:58.929
what are some things that you'd like to be able to do?

00:36:58.929 --> 00:37:01.929
I mean, if you could see all your notes without tapping on each one,

00:37:01.929 --> 00:37:02.929
that would be great.

00:37:02.929 --> 00:37:05.929
And even if you make a note in maybe your phone

00:37:05.929 --> 00:37:09.929
and that it can also be saved in your tablet, that would be really nice.

00:37:09.929 --> 00:37:12.929
Well, what if I told you that in front of you

00:37:12.929 --> 00:37:17.929
is an early version of GW Library.

00:37:17.929 --> 00:37:18.929
This is it?

00:37:18.929 --> 00:37:19.929
With notes.

00:37:19.929 --> 00:37:20.929
Yeah.

00:37:20.929 --> 00:37:24.929
So, a few months ago, the government body gave us approval

00:37:24.929 --> 00:37:26.929
to start working on the notes feature.

00:37:26.929 --> 00:37:29.929
We got together as a team and we'll do like these rough sketches

00:37:29.929 --> 00:37:30.929
and the programmers write code.

00:37:30.929 --> 00:37:33.929
But before we release an update, we have a group of testers.

00:37:33.929 --> 00:37:35.929
You know, they'll find little glitches or bugs or things,

00:37:35.929 --> 00:37:37.929
but they'll try to work it out with the programmers.

00:37:37.929 --> 00:37:41.929
After that, we have a pretty stable version of GW Library.

00:37:41.929 --> 00:37:43.929
The goal is to show it to you

00:37:43.929 --> 00:37:46.929
and you can let us know what you think.

00:37:46.929 --> 00:37:49.929
So, now that you've seen the new notes feature in GW Library,

00:37:49.929 --> 00:37:50.929
what do you think?

00:37:50.929 --> 00:37:54.929
I'd love that I can tag the personal things that I need to work on

00:37:54.929 --> 00:37:57.929
or a common or a scripture that I can encourage someone with.

00:37:57.929 --> 00:37:58.929
This is fantastic.

00:37:58.929 --> 00:37:59.929
Yeah, that's great.

00:37:59.929 --> 00:38:03.929
I like that I can find my notes, especially using the search feature.

00:38:03.929 --> 00:38:04.929
Yeah, that's great.

00:38:04.929 --> 00:38:06.929
And it's really neat how my comments,

00:38:06.929 --> 00:38:09.929
I can place it right next to the paragraph for meetings

00:38:09.929 --> 00:38:11.929
and it doesn't cover the actual text.

00:38:11.929 --> 00:38:15.929
The ability to back it up so you can restore it to another device

00:38:15.929 --> 00:38:17.929
that's going to be really helpful.

00:38:17.929 --> 00:38:18.929
I love it.

00:38:18.929 --> 00:38:19.929
Okay, go ahead.

00:38:22.929 --> 00:38:24.929
That's fantastic.

00:38:24.929 --> 00:38:26.929
That's fantastic, but brothers,

00:38:26.929 --> 00:38:28.929
you can't show us something like that

00:38:28.929 --> 00:38:31.929
and not tell us when we're going to get it.

00:38:31.929 --> 00:38:33.929
Well, we said on the website it was coming soon.

00:38:33.929 --> 00:38:36.929
I know you said that on the website, but when?

00:38:36.929 --> 00:38:38.929
Is it okay to be more specific than that?

00:38:38.929 --> 00:38:40.929
I think that's why they invited us here.

00:38:40.929 --> 00:38:41.929
Paul, let's hear it.

00:38:41.929 --> 00:38:44.929
Well, we're happy to tell you that the notes feature in GW Library

00:38:44.929 --> 00:38:46.929
will be coming soon and by soon,

00:38:46.929 --> 00:38:50.929
we mean during May of 2017 this month.

00:38:50.929 --> 00:38:53.929
So, we can go and check the app stores for an update.

00:38:53.929 --> 00:38:55.929
Oh, that's wonderful to hear.

00:38:55.929 --> 00:38:58.929
So, all of us will be happy to be able to put our own reminders

00:38:58.929 --> 00:39:02.929
right there in the GW Library app.

00:39:02.929 --> 00:39:05.929
Well, that's looking forward to being able to do that as well.

00:39:05.929 --> 00:39:07.929
But now, what I've got you here,

00:39:07.929 --> 00:39:11.929
we're not going to let you go until we ask this big question.

00:39:11.929 --> 00:39:13.929
What are you working on now?

00:39:13.929 --> 00:39:16.929
In other words, what can we expect to see soon

00:39:16.929 --> 00:39:18.929
with GW Library?

00:39:18.929 --> 00:39:21.929
We have another brief video showing what the team is working on

00:39:21.929 --> 00:39:25.929
to support the study Bible on GW Library app.

00:39:25.929 --> 00:39:26.929
Would you like to see it?

00:39:26.929 --> 00:39:28.929
That's wonderful. Let's have a look.

00:39:28.929 --> 00:39:31.369
Later this year,

00:39:31.369 --> 00:39:34.369
work will begin on adding the study edition

00:39:34.369 --> 00:39:37.369
of the New World Translation to GW Library.

00:39:37.369 --> 00:39:40.369
When this edition becomes available in your language,

00:39:40.369 --> 00:39:43.369
you will be able to discover spiritual gems in the study notes

00:39:43.369 --> 00:39:47.369
and the new media gallery will help you to visualize the people,

00:39:47.369 --> 00:39:50.369
places and things you read about.

00:39:50.369 --> 00:39:53.369
You will also see the new overviews of each book

00:39:53.369 --> 00:39:57.369
play the introductory videos and study additional appendix material.

00:39:57.369 --> 00:40:00.369
All of this and more is coming soon

00:40:00.369 --> 00:40:03.369
to GW Library.

00:40:03.369 --> 00:40:05.369
That sounds so exciting.

00:40:05.369 --> 00:40:08.369
So we'll look forward to getting that feature.

00:40:08.369 --> 00:40:10.369
You said coming soon, didn't you?

00:40:10.369 --> 00:40:13.369
Anyway, we'd like to thank you very much

00:40:13.369 --> 00:40:15.369
for the fact that you've come along

00:40:15.369 --> 00:40:17.369
and you've explained so much to us about

00:40:17.369 --> 00:40:22.369
what goes on with MEPs programming and the GW Library app.

00:40:22.369 --> 00:40:25.369
But before you go, we'd like to ask you,

00:40:25.369 --> 00:40:27.369
when you go back to your department,

00:40:27.369 --> 00:40:30.369
please take an expression of our appreciation

00:40:30.369 --> 00:40:32.369
back to the hardworking brothers and sisters

00:40:32.369 --> 00:40:34.369
who were working behind the scenes

00:40:34.369 --> 00:40:36.369
and providing this tool for us.

00:40:36.369 --> 00:40:38.369
We'll do this. Thanks.

00:40:38.369 --> 00:40:40.369
Thank you very much.

00:40:40.369 --> 00:40:43.369
And speaking of behind the scenes,

00:40:43.369 --> 00:40:45.369
do you remember the beautiful dramas

00:40:45.369 --> 00:40:48.369
we had at the regional convention last year?

00:40:48.369 --> 00:40:51.369
One of them was about King Hezekiah.

00:40:51.369 --> 00:40:54.369
We saw not only the threat Jehovah's people faced,

00:40:54.369 --> 00:40:58.369
but also the protection Jehovah provided.

00:40:58.369 --> 00:41:00.369
In producing the drama,

00:41:00.369 --> 00:41:04.369
the audio video services department used a lot of visual effects.

00:41:04.369 --> 00:41:06.369
Let's go behind the scenes

00:41:06.369 --> 00:41:09.369
and find out what the work entailed.

00:41:09.369 --> 00:41:17.989
The goal of our visual effects team

00:41:17.989 --> 00:41:20.989
is to take the work done during film production

00:41:20.989 --> 00:41:22.989
and expand it.

00:41:22.989 --> 00:41:25.989
Our work was driven by the Bible account.

00:41:25.989 --> 00:41:28.989
The audience needed to feel the intimidating power

00:41:28.989 --> 00:41:32.989
of the Assyrian army while not endangering our actors.

00:41:32.989 --> 00:41:34.989
And the use of visual effects

00:41:34.989 --> 00:41:39.989
had the added benefit of drastically saving donated funds.

00:41:39.989 --> 00:41:42.989
But this meant creating hundreds of digital arrows,

00:41:42.989 --> 00:41:46.989
war machines, cities, tents, soldiers,

00:41:46.989 --> 00:41:50.989
and even an Assyrian palace.

00:41:50.989 --> 00:41:52.989
In some cases, the foreground elements

00:41:52.989 --> 00:41:54.989
had to be separated from the background

00:41:54.989 --> 00:41:57.989
so digital components could be added.

00:41:58.989 --> 00:42:00.989
This was a time-consuming process.

00:42:00.989 --> 00:42:02.989
As many foreground elements

00:42:02.989 --> 00:42:05.989
had to be cut out, frame by frame,

00:42:05.989 --> 00:42:09.989
24 times for each second of video.

00:42:09.989 --> 00:42:11.989
Our research team ensured the world created

00:42:11.989 --> 00:42:13.989
was as accurate as possible.

00:42:13.989 --> 00:42:16.989
For example, having period correct materials

00:42:16.989 --> 00:42:20.989
for the temple, as well as accurate stone reliefs.

00:42:20.989 --> 00:42:22.989
After filming was complete,

00:42:22.989 --> 00:42:24.989
the research team noted some scenes

00:42:24.989 --> 00:42:26.989
in the treasury were accidentally shot

00:42:26.989 --> 00:42:28.989
showing priests wearing sandals.

00:42:28.989 --> 00:42:32.369
As this was inaccurate,

00:42:32.369 --> 00:42:34.369
the issue was corrected by generating

00:42:34.369 --> 00:42:36.369
additional digital treasures

00:42:36.369 --> 00:42:38.369
and placing them in the foreground.

00:42:38.369 --> 00:42:44.059
As we didn't have the luxury of 185,000 extras,

00:42:44.059 --> 00:42:46.059
actors were dressed in ancient costumes

00:42:46.059 --> 00:42:48.059
and their pictures taken.

00:42:48.059 --> 00:42:52.059
We then used these pictures to create digital extras,

00:42:52.059 --> 00:42:54.059
using crowd-simulating software

00:42:54.059 --> 00:42:57.059
to place them in the scenes and drive their movements.

00:43:00.340 --> 00:43:03.340
The angel shot proved to be one of the most challenging.

00:43:03.340 --> 00:43:05.340
The original version didn't have

00:43:05.340 --> 00:43:07.340
the dramatic feel needed for the scene,

00:43:07.340 --> 00:43:11.619
so the entire sequence was recreated

00:43:11.619 --> 00:43:13.619
to more accurately convey

00:43:13.619 --> 00:43:19.880
the immense power those present must have witnessed.

00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:21.880
Finishing this project on schedule

00:43:21.880 --> 00:43:23.880
had many challenges.

00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:25.880
After hearing about just a few of them,

00:43:25.880 --> 00:43:27.880
one industry expert said

00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:30.880
what we were attempting was impossible.

00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:31.880
But like Hezekiah,

00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:33.880
when hearing negative reports,

00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:36.880
we stayed positive and relied on Jehovah.

00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:37.880
With his help,

00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:39.880
the film was completed on time

00:43:39.880 --> 00:43:41.880
and is now a wonderful tool

00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:46.480
to bring this Bible account to life.

00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:48.480
A beautiful drama

00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:50.480
and how encouraging it was

00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:53.480
to see Jehovah rescue his people.

00:43:53.480 --> 00:43:55.480
The 2016 Regional Convention

00:43:55.480 --> 00:43:58.480
was excellent, don't you agree?

00:43:58.480 --> 00:44:00.480
But you'll be happy to know

00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:02.480
that we've prepared a little glimpse

00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:03.480
of what is to come

00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:05.480
at this year's convention

00:44:05.480 --> 00:44:11.320
to wet your appetite.

00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:12.320
Are you okay?

00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:13.320
Brian, I'm worried.

00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:15.320
You need more money.

00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:16.320
Jehovah will take care of us.

00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:18.320
He always has.

00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:20.320
We have enough.

00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:22.320
Maybe enough for today.

00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:24.320
But what if you get sick?

00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:26.320
Gloria's mother keeps badgering her

00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:27.320
and me to move up.

00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:28.320
I can get a job

00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:30.320
in my uncle's real estate firm.

00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:33.320
Maybe this is an answer to our prayers.

00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:36.320
What about your pioneering?

00:44:36.320 --> 00:44:37.320
What about it?

00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:39.320
I can do both.

00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:41.320
Gloria, I must congratulate

00:44:41.320 --> 00:44:44.320
on your hard work with my company.

00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:46.320
But you must learn to keep your religion

00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:48.320
in its place.

00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:51.320
We're neglecting family worship,

00:44:51.320 --> 00:44:53.320
study, service.

00:44:53.320 --> 00:44:55.320
We've even become too busy

00:44:55.320 --> 00:44:59.730
or maybe too ashamed to even pray together.

00:44:59.730 --> 00:45:00.730
I'm concerned about you.

00:45:00.730 --> 00:45:01.730
One of the things

00:45:01.730 --> 00:45:03.730
that you always talk to me about

00:45:03.730 --> 00:45:05.730
was Matthew 624.

00:45:05.730 --> 00:45:09.730
You cannot slay for God and for riches.

00:45:09.730 --> 00:45:15.099
You're not the same person that I once knew.

00:45:15.099 --> 00:45:17.099
Dad, where's mom?

00:45:17.099 --> 00:45:19.099
She is coming, right?

00:45:19.099 --> 00:45:24.420
Is it really wrong

00:45:24.420 --> 00:45:27.420
to try and improve our life?

00:45:27.420 --> 00:45:29.420
Mom, mom, mom.

00:45:29.420 --> 00:45:30.420
Remember the wife of God.

00:45:30.420 --> 00:45:33.420
Remember the wife of God.

00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:42.019
If you have yet to make definite plans

00:45:42.019 --> 00:45:45.019
to attend your regional convention this year,

00:45:45.019 --> 00:45:47.019
don't delay.

00:45:47.019 --> 00:45:50.019
Our conventions are a loving provision from Jehovah.

00:45:50.019 --> 00:45:52.019
Whatever it takes,

00:45:52.019 --> 00:45:54.019
talking to your boss to get time off work

00:45:54.019 --> 00:45:56.019
or making travel plans,

00:45:56.019 --> 00:45:58.019
yes, whatever it takes,

00:45:58.019 --> 00:46:00.019
our efforts are worth it

00:46:00.019 --> 00:46:04.019
because we truly treasure Jehovah's Reminders.

00:46:04.019 --> 00:46:08.019
Jesus' words in Matthew 1128 are very appropriate

00:46:08.019 --> 00:46:10.019
considering everything we go through

00:46:10.019 --> 00:46:12.019
in the system of things.

00:46:12.019 --> 00:46:14.019
Come to me.

00:46:14.019 --> 00:46:17.019
All you who are toiling and loaded down

00:46:17.019 --> 00:46:19.019
and I will refresh you.

00:46:19.019 --> 00:46:23.019
Yes, conventions can be of refreshment to us,

00:46:23.019 --> 00:46:25.019
giving us the boost we need.

00:46:25.019 --> 00:46:28.019
But such refreshment is also available

00:46:28.019 --> 00:46:32.019
when the world around us seems to be falling apart.

00:46:32.019 --> 00:46:35.019
How does the organization help our brothers and sisters

00:46:35.019 --> 00:46:38.019
in times of national crisis?

00:46:38.019 --> 00:46:40.019
We met two witness couples

00:46:40.019 --> 00:46:42.019
who personally experienced

00:46:42.019 --> 00:46:45.019
two of the largest terrorist attacks in recent years.

00:46:45.019 --> 00:47:05.380
Not a day goes by when we don't think about our son poorly.

00:47:05.380 --> 00:47:08.380
There was horror and suffering.

00:47:08.380 --> 00:47:11.380
Things we don't want to witness anymore.

00:47:11.380 --> 00:47:26.809
September 11th was a very scary, terrifying day.

00:47:26.809 --> 00:47:33.440
I asked for me when I really understood what was happening.

00:47:33.440 --> 00:47:34.440
I got scared.

00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:36.440
I didn't know what to do.

00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:38.440
I didn't know what to think.

00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:43.980
When the second tower fell,

00:47:43.980 --> 00:47:46.980
Paulie was on 110th floor.

00:47:46.980 --> 00:47:49.980
And everybody was shouting, crying.

00:47:49.980 --> 00:47:52.980
I was praying to Jehovah

00:47:52.980 --> 00:47:55.980
because I was heartbroken.

00:47:55.980 --> 00:48:01.630
We live on Voltaire Boulevard.

00:48:01.630 --> 00:48:03.630
It's a broad avenue.

00:48:03.630 --> 00:48:06.630
There is a concert hall called the Bataclons.

00:48:06.630 --> 00:48:09.630
When the doors of the Bataclons are open,

00:48:09.630 --> 00:48:12.630
we can hear everything that goes on inside.

00:48:15.630 --> 00:48:19.630
That night, three men entered the Bataclons concert hall

00:48:19.630 --> 00:48:22.630
and they started shooting into the crowd.

00:48:22.630 --> 00:48:25.630
We immediately grabbed our gold bags

00:48:25.630 --> 00:48:27.630
and then we sat in front of the sofa

00:48:27.630 --> 00:48:30.630
and we begged Jehovah for his holy spirit

00:48:30.630 --> 00:48:37.210
so we could face the situation.

00:48:37.210 --> 00:48:46.210
It was around 10 pm when there was a news flash

00:48:46.210 --> 00:48:49.210
that announced that there was an attack.

00:48:49.210 --> 00:48:52.210
I was in shock when I heard the news.

00:48:52.210 --> 00:48:58.210
And then I immediately thought about our brothers and sisters.

00:48:58.210 --> 00:49:01.210
I quickly got in contact with the circuit officer

00:49:01.210 --> 00:49:05.210
in order to get some news about our brothers and sisters

00:49:05.210 --> 00:49:08.210
to know how they were doing.

00:49:08.210 --> 00:49:11.210
Then, very early the next morning,

00:49:11.210 --> 00:49:13.210
we set up an emergency committee

00:49:13.210 --> 00:49:16.210
made up of several brothers from the service department.

00:49:16.210 --> 00:49:18.210
We decided to write a letter

00:49:18.210 --> 00:49:20.210
and make other arrangements

00:49:20.210 --> 00:49:23.210
to assist the friends who, in one way or another,

00:49:23.210 --> 00:49:25.210
were affected by this event.

00:49:25.210 --> 00:49:30.579
In turn, the circuit officer would make an effort

00:49:30.579 --> 00:49:33.579
to rapidly get in touch with the elders

00:49:33.579 --> 00:49:36.579
to oversee the affected territory.

00:49:39.579 --> 00:49:42.579
One of our challenges on a personal level

00:49:42.579 --> 00:49:44.579
was whether we would even be able

00:49:44.579 --> 00:49:46.579
to encourage our brothers and sisters

00:49:46.579 --> 00:49:50.579
because we had never experienced such a terrible event.

00:49:50.579 --> 00:49:53.579
We organized ourselves, we paired up as elders

00:49:53.579 --> 00:49:56.579
and headed off to do shepherding.

00:49:56.579 --> 00:50:00.579
We started calling mid-morning on Tuesday.

00:50:00.579 --> 00:50:03.579
We received a report back from all the traveling overseers

00:50:03.579 --> 00:50:05.579
by the end of Thursday.

00:50:05.579 --> 00:50:07.579
And unfortunately,

00:50:07.579 --> 00:50:10.579
we learned that 14 of our brothers and sisters

00:50:10.579 --> 00:50:13.989
had lost their lives.

00:50:13.989 --> 00:50:18.989
We knew that we needed to encourage the families.

00:50:18.989 --> 00:50:22.989
We knew that we needed to shepherd them as soon as possible.

00:50:22.989 --> 00:50:26.989
The elders immediately came.

00:50:26.989 --> 00:50:29.989
We went over the book of Job.

00:50:29.989 --> 00:50:32.989
And I just listened, you know, I was just listening.

00:50:32.989 --> 00:50:35.989
I've heard the same words before, but it was different now.

00:50:35.989 --> 00:50:37.989
The things that were being said

00:50:37.989 --> 00:50:40.989
went straight to my heart.

00:50:40.989 --> 00:50:45.989
A few days later, we were visited by two brothers from Bethel.

00:50:45.989 --> 00:50:48.989
It was very touching that they came to see us

00:50:48.989 --> 00:50:50.989
and that they were concerned about us.

00:50:50.989 --> 00:50:56.989
It shows us that Jehovah was aware of how we felt that night.

00:50:56.989 --> 00:51:00.989
Our brothers were there. They were ready to help one another out.

00:51:00.989 --> 00:51:04.989
Then there was so much empathy and love shown.

00:51:04.989 --> 00:51:08.989
When we were ultimately granted access to ground zero

00:51:08.989 --> 00:51:12.989
and we started encountering the first responders,

00:51:12.989 --> 00:51:16.989
that we let them know how much we appreciated their hard work

00:51:16.989 --> 00:51:19.989
and that they had a skill set that we didn't have.

00:51:19.989 --> 00:51:24.989
But yet our skill set was trying to offer comfort to them.

00:51:24.989 --> 00:51:26.989
We shared a scripture with them.

00:51:26.989 --> 00:51:31.989
Immediately we could tell that that was something that caused emotion

00:51:31.989 --> 00:51:33.989
to rise up in them right away.

00:51:33.989 --> 00:51:36.989
And they expressed great appreciation for that.

00:51:36.989 --> 00:51:39.989
It's one of the beautiful things about the scriptures

00:51:39.989 --> 00:51:43.989
is that they're calming, soothing, comforting.

00:51:43.989 --> 00:51:47.989
And the scriptures did not let down the workers

00:51:47.989 --> 00:51:52.300
that were there at ground zero either.

00:51:52.300 --> 00:51:56.300
The visit of the brothers from Bethel was really a gift from Jehovah.

00:51:56.300 --> 00:51:59.300
It showed his genuine interest in us.

00:51:59.300 --> 00:52:01.300
It was really wonderful.

00:52:01.300 --> 00:52:05.300
After the brothers visited us,

00:52:05.300 --> 00:52:08.300
we felt so comforted.

00:52:08.300 --> 00:52:11.300
So encouraged that we said to each other,

00:52:11.300 --> 00:52:13.300
we have to get back in the ministry

00:52:13.300 --> 00:52:16.300
and comfort people in the territory.

00:52:16.300 --> 00:52:19.300
We have to console our brothers and sisters as well.

00:52:19.300 --> 00:52:23.300
We can only thank and glorify Jehovah

00:52:23.300 --> 00:52:25.300
who really is a God of love.

00:52:25.300 --> 00:52:36.179
I kind of felt Jehovah's hands just reaching out to me,

00:52:36.179 --> 00:52:39.659
which I needed.

00:52:39.659 --> 00:52:42.659
But I cannot wait to the day that I'm totally refreshed

00:52:42.659 --> 00:52:44.659
where I can see.

00:52:44.659 --> 00:52:48.059
I can actually see Paulie.

00:52:48.059 --> 00:52:53.059
I can see him just coming back into our lives

00:52:53.059 --> 00:52:56.059
and I want to embrace him so much.

00:52:56.059 --> 00:53:02.039
After something like this, we are not the same.

00:53:02.039 --> 00:53:10.389
With the help of the organization, the brothers,

00:53:10.389 --> 00:53:13.389
Jehovah's death for us,

00:53:13.389 --> 00:53:16.389
so that is refreshing.

00:53:16.389 --> 00:53:23.760
And I thank Jehovah for what he wants to do for me,

00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:35.849
but also for the millions of people that feel the same way.

00:53:35.849 --> 00:53:38.849
What these couples went through was a horrible reminder

00:53:38.849 --> 00:53:40.849
of Satan's rule,

00:53:40.849 --> 00:53:43.849
but we look forward to the relief from Jehovah,

00:53:43.849 --> 00:53:45.849
the only true hope we have.

00:53:46.849 --> 00:53:48.849
Reminders of Jehovah's care,

00:53:48.849 --> 00:53:50.849
such as these interviews,

00:53:50.849 --> 00:53:54.849
can be the joy of our heart, as the Sama said.

00:53:54.849 --> 00:53:57.849
Yes, the reminder of Jehovah is trustworthy,

00:53:57.849 --> 00:54:01.849
making the inexperienced one wise.

00:54:01.849 --> 00:54:03.849
Before we conclude,

00:54:03.849 --> 00:54:06.849
let's visit our brothers and sisters in India.

00:54:06.849 --> 00:54:10.849
India is the second most populated country in the world

00:54:10.849 --> 00:54:14.849
with a population of some 1.2 billion people.

00:54:14.849 --> 00:54:20.849
The kingdom preaching work is conducted by some 45,000 brothers and sisters

00:54:20.849 --> 00:54:23.849
in 627 congregations.

00:54:23.849 --> 00:54:28.849
And last year, close to 125,000 people attended

00:54:28.849 --> 00:54:31.849
the memorial of Christ's death.

00:54:31.849 --> 00:54:34.849
Our visit brings us to P. Remind,

00:54:34.849 --> 00:54:38.849
which is located in the southern tip of the Indian Peninsula

00:54:38.849 --> 00:54:40.849
in the state of Kerala.

00:54:41.849 --> 00:54:44.849
This town is located some 914 meters

00:54:44.849 --> 00:54:48.849
or almost 3,000 feet above sea level.

00:54:48.849 --> 00:54:51.849
It is a land of spices and lush greenery

00:54:51.849 --> 00:54:55.849
with tea and coffee plantations.

00:54:55.849 --> 00:55:00.849
The two congregations there have a total of 70 publishers.

00:55:00.849 --> 00:55:02.849
Many of them work in tea estates

00:55:02.849 --> 00:55:05.849
and struggle to make a living.

00:55:05.849 --> 00:55:09.849
They are eager users of the JW Library app,

00:55:09.849 --> 00:55:14.849
which they use to share our videos and publications in the ministry.

00:55:14.849 --> 00:55:17.849
As P. Remind is a hill station,

00:55:17.849 --> 00:55:23.929
their territory consists of rugged and uneven terrain.

00:55:23.929 --> 00:55:27.929
Since the congregations there are watching this program together with all of us,

00:55:27.929 --> 00:55:32.929
we wanted to take this opportunity to convey their warm Christian greetings

00:55:32.929 --> 00:55:36.929
to all of Jehovah's people around the world.

00:55:36.929 --> 00:55:38.929
We love you very much.

00:55:38.929 --> 00:55:44.929
This is JW Broadcasting from the World Headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses.
