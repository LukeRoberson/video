00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.849
After attending the school for Kingdom Evangelises, I received an assignment in another part of the country.

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:12.849
It is an area where it is costly to live and the living expenses are high.

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:18.850
I was worried about how it would turn out and if I would manage.

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:23.850
Not too long thereafter, I found a small room I could rent.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.850
The housing conditions were not ideal, but it was okay.

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:33.850
I also received a small cleaning job, but it was not quite enough for me to make both ends meet.

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:39.850
I had to travel a long distance to get to work. I was tired constantly.

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.850
So it was difficult to keep my focus on the ministry.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:50.539
I had some savings when I moved, but it started to shrink.

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:53.539
My funds slowly dwindled.

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:59.679
By coincidence, I saw a job advertisement.

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:06.680
I handed in an application and one and a half hours later, they called me in for an interview.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.540
They felt bad because they could only offer me a part-time position.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.540
To compensate, they offered me a higher salary, which I didn't object to.

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:27.010
At the same time as I found a job, a couple came to me in the Kingdom Hall and said they had found an apartment for me.

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:32.010
So in a city where it is very difficult to find a place to live.

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:36.010
I suddenly had a small and cozy apartment.

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:39.010
Now everything has come together.

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:47.420
This means that I can focus on my ministry and the congregation.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:54.420
Jehovah knows just what we need, and when we test him out, he will bless our efforts.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.420
I really feel safe leaving my life in his hands.
