00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:06.519
while very few of us have taken part in the translation of the Bible.

00:00:06.519 --> 00:00:09.519
All of us can share it with our neighbors

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:13.519
and help them to gain accurate knowledge of Jehovah.

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:15.519
In the following dramatization,

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:19.519
note some of the theocratic activities that this family enjoys

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:24.519
and what they had to do to become so zealous.

00:00:24.519 --> 00:01:00.390
Okay, we already know how this story is going to end.

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.390
No real surprise is there.

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:11.650
So the real question is, how did we get here?

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:20.230
For the record, I never thought our ministry really needed help.

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:29.739
My wife and daughter were both regular pioneers.

00:01:29.739 --> 00:01:32.739
My son was a solid publisher.

00:01:32.739 --> 00:01:38.299
And while my schedule didn't let me pioneer yet,

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:42.299
I was trying to do all I could to support them.

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:50.019
I always assumed that this support I could provide

00:01:50.019 --> 00:01:55.489
was just being out with them as much as possible.

00:01:55.489 --> 00:02:01.379
But I quickly realized more was needed.

00:02:01.379 --> 00:02:05.379
Our field service group overseer had been making a real effort

00:02:05.379 --> 00:02:10.379
to work in the ministry with us regularly the last few weeks.

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:15.379
And he kindly mentioned he'd noticed a few challenges.

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:18.379
While our service time was great,

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:23.379
he pointed out that our return visits were slowly dwindling.

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:26.379
And other than the studies I had with the children,

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:30.379
no one in the family was conducting a Bible study.

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:34.379
I asked him what we could do to try and improve

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:39.009
the quality of our ministry.

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:43.009
He showed me Romans 1519 highlighting Paul's words.

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:49.009
I have thoroughly preached the good news about the Christ.

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:52.009
He suggested on our next family worship night

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:57.009
studying Paul's ministry and seeing what we could learn from his example.

00:02:57.009 --> 00:03:13.860
As we looked at Paul's ministry,

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:19.860
we realized to be more productive we needed boldness.

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.860
Ephesians 619 says,

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.860
Pray also for me that the words may be given to me

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.860
when I open my mouth so that I may be able to speak boldly

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.860
in making known the sacred secret of the good news.

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:45.460
Rina also noticed how Paul reasoned persuasively with people.

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:57.569
And Keiko liked how he found common ground with those he talked to.

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:03.389
Even referring to a pagan altar to an unknown God

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:08.389
as a way to direct the conversation to Jehovah.

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:12.389
Finally, Haruto noted how second Timothy said,

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:16.389
Paul was a workman with nothing to be ashamed of,

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:19.389
handling the word of the truth or right.

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:24.389
So he was skilled in using the scriptures with those he witnessed too.

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:32.180
See, I told you.

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.180
You already knew how this was going to end.

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:42.540
I started auxiliary pioneering.

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:56.379
We now have a number of return visits

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:59.379
and a few progressive Bible studies.

00:04:59.379 --> 00:05:07.120
But how did we get here?

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.120
We learned from the example of Paul

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:14.120
and how he thoroughly preached the good news.
