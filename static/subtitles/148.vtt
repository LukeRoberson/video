00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:09.019
Our theme for this month is, consider, insight, and encourage one another all the more so.

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:15.619
JW Broadcasting, why do we enjoy it so much?

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:20.059
Many of you have expressed how the monthly broadcast draws you closer to our brothers

00:00:20.059 --> 00:00:22.899
and sisters and to Jehovah's organization.

00:00:22.899 --> 00:00:28.059
If you're homebound or isolated, you especially treasure these programs.

00:00:28.059 --> 00:00:34.460
And yet, while we appreciate the advances in technology that have made all of this possible,

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.899
we know that your sincere desire is to be present with your brothers and sisters in person

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.899
at our congregation meetings.

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.020
Jehovah's Witnesses around the world share this feeling.

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:52.780
In Northern Finland, for example, winners are especially cold, even by Finnish standards.

00:00:52.780 --> 00:01:00.219
At times, temperatures plummet to minus 50 degrees Celsius or minus 58 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:05.500
Under those conditions, it's very difficult to drive much less walk-long distances.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.500
Still, the brothers love to gather together.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.579
How do they manage it?

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:17.900
In one small village, there's a brother who lives near the Kingdom Hall and has a warm garage.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:23.099
On meeting nights, he uses his car to bring each family in the congregation to the hall,

00:01:23.099 --> 00:01:28.060
then he parks in his garage and runs the short distance back to the Kingdom Hall.

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:33.459
When the meeting is over, he returns all the friends safely to their homes.

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:39.819
In the Bible, gatherings for pure worship were occasions for personal association with

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:41.299
fellow believers.

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:45.219
Such association required travel to a designated place.

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:50.299
This involved work, sacrifice, even risk.

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:55.099
Consider what is stated at Exodus chapter 34, verse 24.

00:01:55.099 --> 00:02:00.739
This verse has to do with the command that every Israelite male should gather three times

00:02:00.739 --> 00:02:04.219
a year for the festivals in Jerusalem.

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:06.939
What would that mean in practical terms?

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:11.259
Wouldn't the nation be left vulnerable to attack if no men were left to guard the land?

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:15.740
And if words spread among the surrounding nations that practically everyone congregated

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:21.659
in Jerusalem three times a year, like clockwork, year after year, wouldn't it be just a matter

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:26.900
of time before some invading army would come and pillage in Israelite city?

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:34.620
At Exodus 34, 24, we find Jehovah's remarkable answer.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:40.300
For I will drive the nations away from before you, and I will enlarge your territory,

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:47.539
and nobody will desire, yes, even desire your land while you are going up to see the

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:52.620
face of Jehovah your God three times a year.

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.780
Jehovah kept that promise.

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:03.620
It's a historical fact that from 1513 BCE, all the way down to 66 CE, no foreign nation

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:09.780
ever came to invade Israelite territory during those three annual festivals.

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:17.139
Jehovah placed high value on having his people gather together in the same space.

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:23.819
In the Christian era, the Apostle Paul wrote at 1 Corinthians 1423 about the whole congregation

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:26.819
coming together to one place.

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:32.620
Now, although modern broadcasting technology didn't exist in those days, there were other

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:37.740
viable methods of communicating, such as writing letters, that didn't require people to

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:40.500
be physically present in the same location.

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:47.460
Still, the Apostle John, though a capable writer, preferred face-to-face interchange with

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:53.259
fellow Christians as he expressed at 2 John 12.

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:58.580
Or consider what is stated at Job 16.

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:07.020
Now the day came when the sons of the true God entered to take their station before Jehovah.

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.699
Psalm 21 speaks of another such day.

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:16.779
Just imagine, here Jehovah himself, though having all conceivable methods of communication

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:23.300
at his disposal, set specific days for his spirit creatures in heaven to assemble in his

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.100
immediate presence.

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:32.660
Clearly, the scriptures encourage regular personal association with fellow servants of God.

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:37.279
Full attendance through modern communication technology has value, and we're happy to

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:41.699
use it, but it's no substitute for being together.

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:43.220
And why not?

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.860
Because of what association with the congregation achieves, it's not just that we receive

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:55.699
nutritious and varied spiritual food, meetings inform us, but so does JW Broadcasting.

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:59.899
Meetings encourage us, but so does JW Broadcasting.

00:04:59.899 --> 00:05:04.860
Fellow Christians who offer comments and sing from the heart, build us up.

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.220
And yet we can hear that also on JW Broadcasting.

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:14.339
It's when we're together, all together in one place that others can hear us and draw

00:05:14.339 --> 00:05:19.939
encouragement from our heartfelt convictions, our smile, our handshake.

00:05:19.939 --> 00:05:25.620
Meetings give us opportunities to show our brothers and sisters that we esteem them

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:30.939
as worthy of our time, attention, and concern.

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:35.740
That's why we go and visit our brothers who are homebound or isolated because we want

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:39.579
to show them that we love them.

00:05:39.579 --> 00:05:47.300
Moreover, in a special way, our meetings bring us under the influence of Holy Spirit.

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:53.300
At Revelation chapter 2, verse 7, the glorified Jesus said,

00:05:53.300 --> 00:06:00.980
Let the one who has an ear hear what the Spirit says to the congregations.

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:07.779
We need that Spirit to help us resist temptation, to embolden and equip us for the ministry,

00:06:07.779 --> 00:06:11.220
and to enable us to make sound decisions.

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:16.980
Still, there's a reason to attend meetings that's even more important than the pleasant

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:23.180
company, the peaceful atmosphere, the genuine refreshment, the sense of belonging, the opportunities

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:27.100
to give, or even the fact that meetings are a means by which we receive Jehovah's Holy

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:28.420
Spirit.

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:35.139
The key reason why we gather together is stated at Psalm 2612.

00:06:35.139 --> 00:06:44.060
My foot is standing on level ground in the great congregation I will praise Jehovah.

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:51.220
Yes, the principle reason why we gather together in person is to give Jehovah what he deserves,

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:55.579
praise, glory, yes, worship.

00:06:55.579 --> 00:07:01.939
Our meeting attendance shows Jehovah that we want to draw close to him and his son.

00:07:01.939 --> 00:07:06.819
In his abundant love, Jehovah invites many more to serve him and keep living.

00:07:06.819 --> 00:07:12.180
Because he lives eternally, Jehovah can nurture those relationships forever.

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:17.139
The adversary can offer no such hope of endless life, so he promotes selfishness, pride,

00:07:17.139 --> 00:07:20.379
and other negative traits that isolate people from one another, even when they're in the

00:07:20.379 --> 00:07:24.180
same room, engaged in the same activities.

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:31.220
In contrast, our great God is drawing his people closer to himself, to his son, and to

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:39.699
one another, so that we may all be one, as Jesus prayed, as recorded at John 1721.

00:07:39.699 --> 00:07:45.180
And it's not just the act of converging on the same location that unites us either.

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:50.180
Lots of people coexist in the same space when they go to a market, attend a sporting event

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:52.300
or use public transportation.

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:56.540
Crowding of itself does not equate with unity.

00:07:56.540 --> 00:08:00.339
What makes the true Christian congregation different?

00:08:00.339 --> 00:08:05.819
Notice how Hebrews chapter 10 verses 24 and 25 answers this question.

00:08:05.819 --> 00:08:13.620
Now here we find the divinely inspired standard for all our gatherings.

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:19.779
And let us consider one another so as to incite to love and find works.

00:08:19.779 --> 00:08:25.699
Not forsaking our meeting together, some have the custom, but encouraging one another,

00:08:25.699 --> 00:08:31.579
and all the more so as you see the day drawing near.

00:08:31.579 --> 00:08:35.059
Now what does it mean to consider one another?

00:08:35.059 --> 00:08:38.419
What does it mean to incite to love and find works?

00:08:38.419 --> 00:08:42.860
And in what way might we encourage one another?

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:48.940
The verb consider could also be rendered be concerned about, pay attention to.

00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:54.860
So when we consider one another, we show interest that goes far beyond a brief greeting.

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:59.700
And when we pay careful attention to one another, we're better prepared to incite, that

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:03.740
is to motivate one another, to stir one another to action.

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:05.860
And how might we do this?

00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:10.460
Not by making comparisons or shaming our brothers for that would hardly be encouraging one

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:11.460
another.

00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:14.779
We endeavor to lift one another's hearts when we're together.

00:09:14.779 --> 00:09:19.620
And when we do this to the best of our ability, then we can be confident that Jehovah's

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:25.500
Spirit will do the rest and that our brothers will feel strengthened.

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:29.259
It's evident then that true worship means participation.

00:09:29.259 --> 00:09:32.700
It requires a response.

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:37.700
Another noteworthy example of this is the encouragement we both give and receive when

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:40.779
we sing together with our brothers and sisters.

00:09:40.779 --> 00:09:46.139
In ancient Israel, at times they had a chorus, such as the one described in Nehemiah

00:09:46.139 --> 00:09:50.659
chapter 12 that we talked about in our midweek meeting back in February.

00:09:50.659 --> 00:09:56.980
Much of Israel's group singing was antifinal, that is, some of the singers prompted others

00:09:56.980 --> 00:09:58.940
to respond.

00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:05.100
For instance, Psalm 106, which begins and ends with the words Praise Ja, or hallelujah,

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:10.659
encourage the people to say in response, amen.

00:10:10.659 --> 00:10:16.700
Psalm 136 was written to allow for different choruses to answer one another.

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:24.139
Now just imagine responding choruses singing these alternating lines.

00:10:24.139 --> 00:10:27.620
Give thanks to Jehovah for he is good.

00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:30.860
His loyal love endures forever.

00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:36.500
Give thanks to the God of God's for his loyal love endures forever.

00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:43.259
Give thanks to the Lord of lords for his loyal love endures forever, and on it went for

00:10:43.259 --> 00:10:45.740
twenty-six verses.

00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:52.259
To this day, singing demonstrates our heartfelt response to the goodness of Jehovah.

00:10:52.259 --> 00:10:57.539
And what a joy it is to sing in company with others who are moved to pour out the depths

00:10:57.539 --> 00:11:00.059
of their feelings to Jehovah.

00:11:00.059 --> 00:11:04.940
And now at our Kingdom Halls, we're accompanied by orchestral renderings of many of our songs

00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:10.379
and other reasons to sing out at our midweek and weekend meetings.

00:11:10.379 --> 00:11:14.460
And speaking of the midweek meeting, how are you enjoying the new format?

00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:18.500
More of the program is devoted to delving into the Bible itself.

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:24.379
Time spent on preparing us for our public ministry focuses more than ever on situations

00:11:24.379 --> 00:11:27.139
we face in field service.

00:11:27.139 --> 00:11:30.980
And the meetings move along at a satisfying pace.

00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:35.779
Yes, JW Broadcasting is a wonderful blessing.

00:11:35.779 --> 00:11:42.220
A powerful means to talk to and fortify our brothers around the world simultaneously.

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:48.820
Still, nothing can replace the experience of worshipping Jehovah in concert with our

00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:53.539
fellow servants of God at congregation meetings.

00:11:53.539 --> 00:12:00.700
When a meeting concludes, and we lift our heads after the final prayer, we find ourselves

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:06.740
surrounded by others who love Jehovah and support his sovereignty.

00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:12.580
These important benefits are detailed in the April 2016 study article, why should we

00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:14.820
meet together for worship?

00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:18.460
This month, we're studying that article worldwide.

00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:25.259
Later, in October, we begin a special campaign to invite the public to our meetings.

00:12:25.259 --> 00:12:30.100
If you do not yet regularly associate with Jehovah's Witnesses, or if you travel away from

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:35.740
your congregation, use JW.org to find a meeting you can attend.

00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:42.139
Click about us, meetings, and find a location near you.

00:12:42.139 --> 00:12:49.539
Or simply scroll to the bottom of any JW.org page and click attend our meetings.

00:12:49.539 --> 00:12:55.940
At our meetings, you'll experience what it means to consider, insight, and encourage

00:12:55.940 --> 00:13:00.740
one another all the more so as we see the day drawing near.
