00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:08.359
As Jehovah's servants, nothing brings us greater joy than worshiping the true God.

00:00:08.359 --> 00:00:11.359
But we are also human.

00:00:11.359 --> 00:00:19.359
This means that from time to time, any of us can and probably will experience unsettling moments.

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:22.359
Times when we question our worth.

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:29.359
For example, have you ever wondered about your true value in Jehovah's eyes?

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:36.359
Have you ever experienced moments of anxiety about your place in his organization?

00:00:36.359 --> 00:00:40.359
Or have you struggled with feelings of worthlessness?

00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:44.359
Such thoughts can erode our joy.

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:49.359
And we might even begin to doubt our personal worth to Jehovah.

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:53.359
If that has happened to you, you're not alone.

00:00:53.359 --> 00:01:01.359
Centuries ago, the writer of Psalm 94 revealed that he too was overwhelmed by anxieties.

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:06.359
Let's read it together at Psalm 94 and verse 19.

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:09.359
The writer is addressing Jehovah.

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:15.609
When anxieties overwhelmed me, you comforted and soothed me.

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:20.609
Notice the footnote on verse 19, disquieting thoughts.

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:31.609
These can arise from factors such as guilt over the fact that we cannot do more in the ministry or in the congregation,

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:39.609
fear of the future of being separated from the ones we know and love and despair from being overlooked,

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:42.609
feeling that we don't really matter.

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:48.609
Disquieting thoughts are real and can overwhelm us at times.

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:52.609
We can rob us of our inner peace and our sleep.

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:59.609
And if we're not careful, they can even stifle our prayers, damaging our relationship with Jehovah.

00:01:59.609 --> 00:02:02.609
Nothing would make Satan happier.

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:10.610
We never want that to happen, especially now, since this old world is so near to closing.

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.610
So what can help us to soothe these disquieting thoughts?

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:21.610
In this month's broadcast, we will find the answer in a heartwarming prophecy.

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:31.610
We hope that this inspired message will provide a strong scriptural basis to help you to dispel any feelings of inadequacy.

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.610
Which prophecy?

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.610
Well, please open your Bible to Isaiah chapter 56.

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:44.610
Here we read of one of the most touching expressions of Jehovah's appreciation for two groups of people.

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.610
Both groups wanted to serve Jehovah.

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:57.610
But under the Mosaic law, they were limited or even disqualified from fully participating in Jehovah's arrangement for pure worship.

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:58.610
Who were they?

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:04.610
Let's read Isaiah chapter 56, verse 3.

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:13.610
The foreigner, who joins himself to Jehovah should not say, Jehovah will surely separate me from his people.

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:19.610
And the eunuch should not say, look, I'm a dried-up tree.

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:29.610
Did you notice the two groups, foreigners or non-Israelites, and eunuchs, men who physically could not produce children?

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:35.610
They faced very difficult and possibly disheartening circumstances.

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:44.610
During Isaiah's time, uncircumcised foreigners were allowed to live in Israel, but they had no permanent ties with the nation.

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:49.610
Because of their status, they could not eat of the Passover meal.

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:55.610
And as a protection, the Israelites were not to associate closely with them.

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:04.610
But many foreigners came to love Jehovah, converted to pure worship, and served Jehovah alongside his people.

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.610
They were called proselytes.

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:13.610
Nevertheless, even they could not fully become part of the nation of Israel.

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:18.610
How would you feel if you were a foreigner alive at that time?

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:23.610
Your biggest fear would be getting cut off from God's people.

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:27.610
Might you have disquieting thoughts at times?

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:32.610
Consider the second group. Isaiah mentioned eunuchs.

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.610
These were men who had their reproductive organs removed.

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:44.610
It was the custom of Eastern pagan nations to make eunuchs out of some of the male children, taken captive in war,

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:51.610
and then assigned them to serve as trusted officials in royal courts or in other settings.

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:57.610
It appears that during the days of Isaiah, some of these Gentile eunuchs learned about Jehovah,

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:02.610
came to love him and decided to align themselves with Jehovah's people.

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:11.920
These eunuchs enjoyed a measure of acceptance among Jehovah's people, and they had the privilege of worshipping Jehovah.

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:20.920
However, because they were eunuchs, they could not become fully-fledged members of the congregation of Israel.

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:30.920
Plus, at that time and in that culture, they suffered great humiliation and not being able to father children.

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:37.920
Do you think they experienced disquieting thoughts at times? We know they did.

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:44.920
But Isaiah reveals something significant about this group. Jehovah loved them.

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:47.920
In effect, Jehovah says to them,

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:53.920
I know how you feel. Now, let me tell you how I feel about you.

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:59.920
Let's read Isaiah chapter 56, verses 4 and 5.

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:04.579
For this is what Jehovah says to the eunuchs,

00:06:04.579 --> 00:06:10.579
who keep my Sabbaths and who choose what I delight in and who hold fast to my covenant.

00:06:10.579 --> 00:06:16.579
I will give to them in my house and within my walls a monument and a name,

00:06:16.579 --> 00:06:19.579
something better than sons and daughters,

00:06:19.579 --> 00:06:25.579
an everlasting name I will give them, one that will not perish.

00:06:25.579 --> 00:06:31.579
I will give them something better than sons and daughters, an everlasting name.

00:06:31.579 --> 00:06:38.579
Their physical limitations did not diminish their value in the eyes of our loving God,

00:06:38.579 --> 00:06:42.579
because of their whole soul obedience to Him.

00:06:42.579 --> 00:06:50.579
Jehovah would always remember them. They would have an everlasting name, one that would not perish.

00:06:50.579 --> 00:06:57.579
Jehovah treasured these faithful ones so much that he kept the memory of their service in his house,

00:06:57.579 --> 00:07:04.579
within his walls, like a monument, so as to cherish them daily.

00:07:04.579 --> 00:07:11.579
Imagine how those eunuchs felt now knowing that their God had something special reserved for them.

00:07:11.579 --> 00:07:14.579
They knew Jehovah had heard their prayers.

00:07:14.579 --> 00:07:18.579
They knew that their God felt compassion for them.

00:07:18.579 --> 00:07:22.579
All those desquieting thoughts started to melt away.

00:07:22.579 --> 00:07:27.579
Those comforting words started to heal their broken spirit.

00:07:27.579 --> 00:07:32.579
But why did Jehovah make these promises to these two groups?

00:07:32.579 --> 00:07:36.579
What did he see that others may not have?

00:07:36.579 --> 00:07:40.579
We don't have all the details, but we do have some.

00:07:40.579 --> 00:07:44.579
They are revealed to us much later in time,

00:07:44.579 --> 00:07:47.579
and they give us valuable clues.

00:07:47.579 --> 00:07:50.579
For example, in the book of Nehemiah,

00:07:50.579 --> 00:07:56.579
we are introduced to two foreigners who are living among God's people.

00:07:56.579 --> 00:08:00.579
There is a significant detail about their names.

00:08:00.579 --> 00:08:07.579
Nehemiah chapter 3 and verse 7 tells us they were Melataya, the Ghibinite,

00:08:07.579 --> 00:08:13.579
and Jaden, the Moranithite, who were of foreign descent.

00:08:13.579 --> 00:08:16.579
Yet their names tell a different story.

00:08:16.579 --> 00:08:18.579
What do they mean?

00:08:18.579 --> 00:08:22.579
Melataya means Jaha has provided escape.

00:08:22.579 --> 00:08:26.579
Jaden means Jehovah has given ear.

00:08:26.579 --> 00:08:29.579
How did they get those names?

00:08:29.579 --> 00:08:32.580
These men were likely born in Babylon.

00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:37.580
Children of foreigners who joined in true worship in Israel,

00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:41.580
and who were later taken captive in 607 BCE.

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:46.580
The parents of these men were not natural Israelites.

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:50.580
However, the names they chose for their children

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:55.580
reflected their devotion and love for Jehovah's name.

00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:59.580
And the fact that these sons of non-Israelites

00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:02.580
would want to share in rebuilding Jerusalem

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:06.580
shows how they themselves love Jehovah.

00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:10.580
How did Jehovah feel about these foreigners?

00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:18.580
Notice his prophetic words as we continue on at Isaiah chapter 56, verse 6 and 7.

00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:23.860
As for the foreigners who joined themselves to Jehovah,

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:26.860
to minister to him, to love the name of Jehovah,

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:30.860
and to be his servants, all those who keep the Sabbath

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:34.860
and do not profane it, and who hold fast to my covenant.

00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:37.860
I will also bring them to my holy mountain

00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:40.860
and make them rejoice inside my house of prayer.

00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:43.860
Their whole burnt offerings and their sacrifices

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:46.860
will be accepted on my altar from my house

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:51.860
will be called a house of prayer for all the peoples.

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:54.860
Jehovah noticed that these foreigners

00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:57.860
faithfully observed the laws of a covenant

00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:00.860
that they could never be fully a part of.

00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:02.860
In verses 6 and 7,

00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:06.860
Jehovah was in effect inviting them into his home,

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:09.860
a house of prayer for all the peoples,

00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:12.860
Jew and foreigner alike.

00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:16.860
Hearing these words must have lifted their heavy hearts.

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:20.860
But Jehovah did more than just tell them how much he valued them.

00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:24.860
He showed them how.

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:26.860
Among the foreigners who returned to the ruins

00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:29.860
of Jerusalem at 537 BCE,

00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:31.860
were a particular group of foreigners

00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:34.860
who had become proselytes,

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:37.860
and they included descendants of the Ghibinites,

00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:40.860
a nation that had joined themselves to Israel

00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:44.860
and served as gathers of wood and draws of water

00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:48.860
for the assembly and for Jehovah's altar.

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:52.860
These descendants of the Ghibinites had spent decades

00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:56.860
as captives in Babylon for crimes they did not commit.

00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:59.860
They had no land inheritance back in Israel.

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:01.860
They were servants.

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:03.860
Yet they traveled back to Israel

00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:05.860
and helped rebuild the temple

00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:07.860
and the walls of Jerusalem.

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:09.860
What motivated them?

00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:12.860
They loved Jehovah.

00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:14.860
These descendants of Ghibin

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:17.860
expected nothing in return for their service

00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:22.860
but they did receive something quite unexpected.

00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:25.860
After the Israelites received their portioned land,

00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:28.860
this group called the Nethanem,

00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:30.860
who did not have a land inheritance,

00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:32.860
were assigned a place to live.

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:34.860
Where would they be placed?

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:37.860
Outside the city, in a slum,

00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:40.860
in some abandoned part of forgotten Jerusalem?

00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:45.860
No. The Bible tells us they were assigned to live in Oful.

00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:47.860
Now take a look at the map

00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:49.860
and see for yourself

00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:54.860
where Oful is located right next to the temple.

00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:58.860
Jehovah made these humble gathers of wood his neighbors.

00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:01.860
This underscores how much Jehovah loved

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:03.860
and cherished these faithful foreigners

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:05.860
who motivated by love

00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:09.860
that all they could to share in his worship.

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:11.860
Well, what's the lesson?

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:14.860
Both the Unix and the foreigners were limited

00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:17.860
and what they could do in God's service.

00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:19.860
From a human standpoint,

00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:22.860
they were probably considered less than ordinary.

00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:24.860
Nothing special.

00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:28.860
Perhaps some even considered them outcasts.

00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:31.860
That is not how Jehovah viewed them.

00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:34.860
He knew each one by name.

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:36.860
He listened to their prayers,

00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:41.860
and he viewed each individual as a precious gem.

00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:43.860
Where man sees the ordinary,

00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:47.860
our Heavenly Father sees the extra ordinary.

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:49.860
To illustrate,

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:51.860
what do you see here?

00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:54.860
If you are thinking sand, you are right.

00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:58.860
Sand is one of the most common substances on the earth.

00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:02.860
To us, it typically looks bland and ordinary.

00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:06.860
Each particle identical to the next.

00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:08.860
No color, no sparkle.

00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:12.860
You never see someone show off a sand necklace or bracelet.

00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:18.860
But what happens if you look at sand under the microscope?

00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:23.860
To the naked eye, all sand looks the same and is pretty dull.

00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:26.860
But magnified a hundredfold or more,

00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:30.860
each individual grain of sand reveals distinct beauty.

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:33.860
We see parts of shells and crystals,

00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:36.860
all contrasting in shapes and colors.

00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:41.860
There is a treasure trove and a handful of sand.

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:45.860
That is how Jehovah sees each of you.

00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:49.860
Just as he saw the faithful foreigners in Unix

00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:52.860
for the precious gems that they were,

00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:54.860
he sees you too.

00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:59.860
Yes, you who may be restricted by age, health,

00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:01.860
physical stamina, emotions,

00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:03.860
or family responsibilities from doing

00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:07.860
as much in some spiritual activities as you would like to.

00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:12.860
But those limitations do not define you.

00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:14.860
Remember that in God's eyes,

00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:19.860
your worth as a person is not measured by how much you do,

00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:22.860
but rather how much you try.

00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:25.860
With eternity and perfection in view,

00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:29.860
Jehovah chooses to see not your limitations,

00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:32.860
but your potential.

00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:34.860
When you serve Jehovah,

00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:35.860
whole soul,

00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:38.860
despite limited circumstances,

00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:41.860
you sparkle in his eyes.

00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:45.860
And because you shine so brightly in Jehovah's heart,

00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:47.860
he will always help you.

00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:50.860
He will always cherish you.

00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:53.860
Do you remember the faithful Psalmist who wrote about

00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:55.860
being overwhelmed by disquieting thoughts

00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:58.860
at Psalm 94 and 19?

00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:00.860
In the very next line,

00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:02.860
he tells Jehovah,

00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:05.860
you comforted and soothed me.

00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:06.860
Well, by the way,

00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:08.860
who wrote that Psalm?

00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:10.860
We don't know his name,

00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:12.860
but Jehovah does.

00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:15.860
And he carefully preserved that unknown writer's words

00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:19.860
for thousands of years in the Bible.

00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:21.860
Like the Psalmist,

00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:22.860
the foreigner,

00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:23.860
the unique,

00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:25.860
no matter the circumstances,

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:27.860
when you humbly served Jehovah,

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:29.860
when you try your best,

00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:31.860
your work is never fruitless.

00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:35.860
And everlasting name is reserved for each of you,

00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:39.860
because your Heavenly Father cherishes you.
