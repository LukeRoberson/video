00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:18.809
My name is Subantu Sunti, I grew up in Guguletu Cape Town, where I serve as a congregation

00:00:18.809 --> 00:00:22.079
elder.

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:31.449
I love the people I associate with now, but I wasn't always like this.

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:33.369
I had no love for people.

00:00:33.369 --> 00:00:39.810
I viewed them only as a way to get rich by stealing their possessions.

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:44.929
I was a violent person, always on the edge of anger.

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:51.729
I used drugs and I belonged to a gang.

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:59.119
We were violent, though.

00:00:59.119 --> 00:01:04.420
We lived a very destructive life.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:09.780
In 1989, my mother started associating with Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.500
I noticed her making changes in her life.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:20.459
Previously, she sold alcohol in the community illegally, but now she stopped.

00:01:20.459 --> 00:01:25.540
So one Thursday, I followed her to see where she was going.

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:31.420
I was touched to see a boy there who read the Bible really well.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.739
I wanted to be able to do that too.

00:01:34.739 --> 00:01:39.620
So after the meeting, I approached the brother and he said I first needed to study the

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:45.099
Bible, and that's how we started the Bible study.

00:01:45.099 --> 00:01:51.730
I continued studying, but I struggled to make changes.

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:57.689
I was still involved in a lot of bad things, and this caused me to stop the study because

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:11.439
I knew I had to clean up my life first.

00:02:11.439 --> 00:02:19.719
During the years I did not study, I never stopped thinking about the Bible.

00:02:19.719 --> 00:02:26.639
As I or chapter 40 verse 8 has very touching words, let's say, the green grass dries up,

00:02:26.639 --> 00:02:32.240
the blossom withers, but the word of our God endures forever.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.080
That scripture resonated with me.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.479
It helped me to trust in the Bible, made me want to read it.

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:45.800
The book that helped me to make spiritual progress was a Revelation climax book, which

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.759
Jehovah's Witnesses were studying back then.

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:55.120
It thoroughly explained the Bible book of Revelation, and that convinced me that whoever wrote

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.719
this book could not have done it on their own, but they must have been influenced by God

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:03.759
in order to explain it so well.

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:10.000
That book helped me change my life, and be sure that this was the truth.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:17.479
Four years had passed since I stopped studying, but in January 1995 I made a decision.

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:23.680
One Sunday I woke up, I got ready, and went to the meeting.

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:30.680
I made rapid progress and was baptized in September 1995, and six months later I was

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.120
appointed as a full-time teacher of the Bible.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.199
Now I view people differently.

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:42.560
I see them as people who deserve a better life.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:48.599
Even if a person appears I'm able to change, the Bible can teach a person dignity and

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:53.310
change his life for the better.

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:58.430
Now I view people as those who could be my spiritual friends, my brothers.
