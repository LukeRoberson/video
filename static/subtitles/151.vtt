00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:03.459
Have you enjoyed studying the book,

00:00:03.459 --> 00:00:06.459
imitate their faith as much as I have?

00:00:06.459 --> 00:00:08.460
It's a wonderful book, isn't it?

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.460
And I was particularly captivated by the introduction.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.460
There was a point in the introduction that encouraged us to use

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.460
our imagination when we're reading the Bible,

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.460
to see the sights, to hear the sounds,

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.460
to smell the aromas, to try to capture the feelings

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.460
of the individuals that we are reading about.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.460
Now, of course, we don't want our imagination to run away with us.

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.460
But at the same time, we do want to get a solid,

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.460
mental picture of what we're reading.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.460
And that's what I'd like to talk to you about today.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.460
When you're reading the Bible, try to get the whole picture.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.460
Now, we'll use a couple of well-known Bible accounts to illustrate.

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:57.829
Have you been raised in a step family or a blended family?

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.829
If you have, did you know that you have something in common

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.829
with Joseph, the son of Jacob?

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:11.829
Joseph was raised with 10 half-brothers in a large blended family.

00:01:11.829 --> 00:01:17.829
So, now you want to try to view this family as a composite.

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:20.829
You want to try to figure out how did people mash

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:24.829
or how did they clash within this family?

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:25.829
What would you do?

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:29.829
Well, you might start by writing down some of the characteristics

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:31.829
of the individual members of the family.

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.829
What about Joseph's half-brothers and Joseph himself?

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.829
What do you know about them?

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:38.829
What about Judah?

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:39.829
Simion?

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:40.829
Levi?

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:41.829
Dan?

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:42.829
Nathalie?

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:44.829
What do you know?

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:47.829
So, write down their characteristics and try to figure out

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:49.829
how they might get along.

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.829
Sometimes, there is one individual incident

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:55.829
that's recorded in the Bible.

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.829
But we mustn't forget.

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:01.829
People's actions have a way of affecting other people.

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.829
So, when you read about a certain incident in the Bible,

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:09.830
try to imagine who might have been affected by that incident.

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.830
Take an example.

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.830
In the book of Genesis, we read that Jacob's son, Ruben,

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.830
committed sexual immorality with Bilha.

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.830
Well, that had an effect on other people without doubt.

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.830
Who was Ruben?

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.830
He was Leah's oldest son.

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.830
Who was Bilha?

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.830
Rachel's handmaiden.

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.830
Do you think that there might have been a little animosity or tension

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.830
between Leah and Rachel sometimes?

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.830
Especially when you consider how their marriage has started out?

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:46.830
There may have been.

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.830
And it may be that the attitudes of the women

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.830
had some bearing on the attitudes of their sons as well.

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.830
So, you take all of these things into consideration.

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:00.830
Now, Bilha had two sons, Dan and Naftali.

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.830
How do you think they felt when they learned that their oldest brother

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.830
or half brother had committed fornication with their mother?

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.830
So, there could have been tension there.

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.830
And this all goes into the mix when we're considering the family

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:17.830
as a composite.

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:22.830
Now, do you picture Joseph at age 17

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:27.830
with 10 much older, half brothers, maybe in their 30s?

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.830
Some old enough to be his father?

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:32.830
Not true.

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.830
The truth is that there was only a seven-year age difference

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:41.830
between Joseph's oldest brother, Ruben, and Joseph himself.

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:46.830
In fact, 11 of Jacob's sons were born during the seven-year period

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:50.830
when Jacob was working for Laban.

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:53.830
11 sons in seven years?

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:55.830
How is that possible?

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:56.830
Easy.

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:00.830
When you remember that Jacob had two wives and two culture binds

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:02.830
or secondary wives.

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:05.830
So, they didn't have to be a nine-month interval

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:08.830
between the birth of the children.

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:11.830
Some could have been born just about at the same time.

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:14.830
They could have been the same age.

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:18.829
So, when Joseph was sold into slavery at age 17,

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:22.829
his oldest brother was no more than 24.

00:04:22.829 --> 00:04:27.829
Some of his brothers were only a year or two older than Joseph himself.

00:04:27.829 --> 00:04:32.829
So, we're talking about a group of young men in their late teens and early 20s

00:04:32.829 --> 00:04:39.829
and this might explain some of the hot-headed reactions that some of those young men had.

00:04:39.829 --> 00:04:41.829
Well, so much for the boys.

00:04:41.829 --> 00:04:44.829
What about their father, Jacob?

00:04:44.829 --> 00:04:46.829
What can we learn about him?

00:04:46.829 --> 00:04:47.829
A lot.

00:04:47.829 --> 00:04:50.829
For one thing, he was a spiritual man.

00:04:50.829 --> 00:04:53.829
Now, this is something for you young brothers and sisters

00:04:53.829 --> 00:04:56.829
who are contemplating marriage to think about.

00:04:56.829 --> 00:05:01.829
Jacob was willing to go to any length to keep his relationship with Jehovah intact.

00:05:02.829 --> 00:05:04.829
Let's take an example.

00:05:04.829 --> 00:05:08.829
Genesis chapter 29 and verse 18.

00:05:08.829 --> 00:05:12.829
You can follow along on the screen as I read this.

00:05:12.829 --> 00:05:15.829
And we're talking about marriage here.

00:05:15.829 --> 00:05:18.829
Genesis 29, 18, it says,

00:05:18.829 --> 00:05:21.829
Jacob had fallen in love with Rachel.

00:05:21.829 --> 00:05:22.829
So, he said,

00:05:22.829 --> 00:05:29.829
I am willing to serve you seven years for your younger daughter, Rachel.

00:05:30.829 --> 00:05:32.829
Now, what's the takeaway?

00:05:32.829 --> 00:05:37.829
Jacob didn't marry the first person who came along, maybe some pagan woman.

00:05:37.829 --> 00:05:40.829
He didn't say, well, seven years is too long to wait.

00:05:40.829 --> 00:05:43.829
I'm going to find some Felistian woman, now marry her.

00:05:43.829 --> 00:05:50.829
He was willing to wait so that he could marry someone who would join him in the worship of Jehovah.

00:05:50.829 --> 00:05:53.829
And you young folks, if you are willing to wait,

00:05:53.829 --> 00:05:57.829
you can be sure that you will have Jehovah's blessing as well.

00:05:58.829 --> 00:06:04.829
Now, Jacob was apparently also a bit of a romantic, notice verse 20.

00:06:04.829 --> 00:06:09.829
It says, and Jacob served seven years for Rachel, but notice this.

00:06:09.829 --> 00:06:16.829
But in his eyes, they were like just a few days because of his love for her.

00:06:16.829 --> 00:06:18.829
Isn't that poetic?

00:06:18.829 --> 00:06:25.829
Jacob may have learned to treasure his wife by observing his parents Isaac and Rebecca.

00:06:25.829 --> 00:06:27.829
It appears that they had a strong marriage.

00:06:27.829 --> 00:06:34.829
I just noticed what we read at Genesis 26 and verse 8.

00:06:34.829 --> 00:06:39.829
Genesis 26 and verse 8.

00:06:39.829 --> 00:06:42.829
It says, after some time had passed,

00:06:42.829 --> 00:06:46.829
a bimolec king of the Felistians was looking out of the window,

00:06:46.829 --> 00:06:54.829
and he saw Isaac, that's Jacob's father, displaying affection for Rebecca his wife.

00:06:55.829 --> 00:07:03.829
So it appears that Isaac and Rebecca had a warm relationship, a good marriage.

00:07:03.829 --> 00:07:06.829
Now, what else can we learn about Jacob?

00:07:06.829 --> 00:07:12.829
There's an interesting detail recorded in chapter 25 and verse 27.

00:07:12.829 --> 00:07:15.829
It says, as the boys got bigger,

00:07:15.829 --> 00:07:21.829
Esau, Jacob's brother, became a skilled hunter, a man in the field,

00:07:21.829 --> 00:07:28.829
but Jacob was a blameless man, dwelling in tents.

00:07:28.829 --> 00:07:32.829
So Jacob liked to dwell in tents.

00:07:32.829 --> 00:07:38.829
That might explain the strong bond that developed between Jacob and Joseph,

00:07:38.829 --> 00:07:41.829
who was his youngest for many years.

00:07:41.829 --> 00:07:47.829
Although Jacob liked to dwell in tents, he was by no means a sissy.

00:07:47.829 --> 00:07:52.829
He was a strong man, but he was a spiritual man.

00:07:52.829 --> 00:07:55.829
That's something for you, young brothers, to take away.

00:07:55.829 --> 00:08:02.829
You want to be strong, we know you do, but spirituality should come first.

00:08:02.829 --> 00:08:11.829
One time, spiritual Jacob gave his sons a beautiful lesson on how to settle a difference with a family member.

00:08:11.829 --> 00:08:14.829
We read about it at Genesis chapter 32,

00:08:14.829 --> 00:08:19.829
and I think all of us can learn from his example.

00:08:19.829 --> 00:08:25.829
We learn at Genesis 32 that Jacob's brother Esau was coming to see him.

00:08:25.829 --> 00:08:28.829
Now, they hadn't seen each other for 20 years,

00:08:28.829 --> 00:08:32.830
and to say that their parting had been difficult is an understatement.

00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:37.830
The fact is that when they separated more than 20 years earlier,

00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:41.830
Esau had vowed that one day he was going to kill his brother.

00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:44.830
Now he was coming to see him.

00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:47.830
Now, why was he so angry with Jacob?

00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:52.830
It's because Jacob had received a blessing from their father,

00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:56.830
and Esau was not happy.

00:08:56.830 --> 00:09:01.830
So Esau arrives, and 400 men are with him.

00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:05.830
Why 400 men? Well, the Bible doesn't say,

00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:11.830
but it could be that he was trying to show how important and prominent he had become.

00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:16.830
How did Jacob react? Did he try to go tit for tat?

00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:20.830
Did he try to show how important and prominent he had become

00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:23.830
with all of the blessings he'd received?

00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:29.830
Did he reopen old wounds? Did he argue with his brother?

00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:32.830
Did he say, you know, I was right all along,

00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:35.830
and you Esau, you have been wrong.

00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:40.830
Did he demand an apology? No.

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:44.830
There was a lot that Jacob could have bragged about, no question about that.

00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:47.830
There was no doubt that Jacob had Jehovah's blessing.

00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:52.830
Early on, we read that an angel of Jehovah had appeared to him,

00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:54.830
and said, I am Jehovah.

00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:58.830
The God of Abraham, your father, and the God of Isaac.

00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:04.830
The land on which you are lying to you, I am going to give it, and to your offspring.

00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:10.830
I am with you, and I will safeguard you wherever you go.

00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:13.830
I will not leave you.

00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:17.830
Well, that's quite a blessing, isn't it? But there's more.

00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:23.830
For a portion of the previous night, that is, the night before Esau and Jacob met up,

00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:26.830
Jacob had wrestled with an angel.

00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:32.830
And as a result, he had managed to receive another blessing.

00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:36.830
But Jacob didn't flaunt his blessings.

00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:39.830
Instead, he humbled himself.

00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:43.830
In fact, he even bowed down seven times before his brother,

00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:48.830
in front of his wives and his eleven sons.

00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:54.830
So Jacob settled any lingering difference with Esau, not with his fists,

00:10:54.830 --> 00:10:59.830
not with a bragging tongue, not with a weapon, but humbly,

00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:06.179
like a real man, like a real spiritual man.

00:11:06.179 --> 00:11:13.179
In contrast, how did Jacob's ten sons settle their difference with Joseph?

00:11:13.179 --> 00:11:18.179
Like a bunch of cowards, it was ten to one against Joseph.

00:11:18.179 --> 00:11:22.179
First, they decided to kill their brother,

00:11:22.179 --> 00:11:25.179
and then they delivered him up into slavery.

00:11:25.179 --> 00:11:33.179
Those jealous young men didn't learn a thing from their father's excellent spiritual example.

00:11:33.179 --> 00:11:37.179
Well, if you're on the outs with a member of your family,

00:11:37.179 --> 00:11:40.179
if you had a serious difficulty with someone,

00:11:40.179 --> 00:11:45.179
could you try to settle a matter peacefully as Jacob did?

00:11:45.179 --> 00:11:49.179
If the person tries to apologize, be gracious about it.

00:11:49.179 --> 00:11:52.179
Don't make it difficult for him to apologize.

00:11:52.179 --> 00:11:57.179
Don't dredge up all of the unnecessary details about the past.

00:11:57.179 --> 00:12:00.179
You may be in the right, as Jacob was,

00:12:00.179 --> 00:12:03.179
but isn't the important thing to make peace?

00:12:03.179 --> 00:12:07.179
Jehovah loves the peacemakers.

00:12:07.179 --> 00:12:10.179
Well, what else do we learn about Jacob?

00:12:10.179 --> 00:12:14.179
We learn that he wasn't his father's favorite.

00:12:14.179 --> 00:12:22.860
Let's look at Genesis chapter 25, verse 28.

00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:25.860
And Isaac loved Issa,

00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:28.860
because it meant game in his mouth,

00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:33.860
whereas Rebecca loved Jacob.

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:36.860
Now, this story may resonate with many of you out there,

00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:39.860
especially if you've grown up in a large family,

00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:42.860
or perhaps you've had a number of brothers and sisters.

00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:47.860
Now, we know your parents claim that they always treated all of you the same,

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:49.860
that they never ever had a preference.

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:51.860
But ask the kids,

00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:54.860
was there anyone in the family who was the favorite?

00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:56.860
They all know she was.

00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:57.860
They know this.

00:12:57.860 --> 00:12:59.860
The parents don't realize it,

00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:02.860
but they are giving preferential treatment.

00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:06.860
And so, this happens, and it can be disconcerting at times.

00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:08.860
Imagine this scenario.

00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:12.860
Imagine that you have a couple who have two children, two sons.

00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:14.860
One is a pioneer.

00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:18.860
He has never given his parents a moment's grief.

00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:21.860
The other never accepted the truth,

00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:24.860
but he's done well in business.

00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:28.860
And as a result, he's been generous to his parents.

00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:32.860
And the parents are grateful, very grateful.

00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:37.860
And the pioneer often hears the parents bragging about the successes

00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:40.860
that his brother has had in business.

00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:42.860
Well, the pioneer can't help.

00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:44.860
The parents are materially very much.

00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:47.860
And so, he feels that there's a bit of partiality there.

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:49.860
Is it hurtful?

00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:51.860
Yes, but his life.

00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:53.860
It's chemistry.

00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:55.860
It's just chemistry.

00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:57.860
But the pioneer needs to realize

00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:00.860
that Jehovah God appreciates his work.

00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:03.860
His Heavenly Father loves him very much

00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:06.860
for the work that he's doing for his name.

00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:08.860
Now, Jacob must have known

00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:12.860
that Isaac loved his brother more than he loved him.

00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:15.860
And perhaps he vowed that when he had children,

00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:17.860
he would treat them all the same.

00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:20.860
Well, if he did, he didn't keep that promise, did he?

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:24.860
Everyone knew that Joseph was the favorite.

00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:28.299
Well, have you noticed what we had to do

00:14:28.299 --> 00:14:31.299
to make a composite of this family?

00:14:31.299 --> 00:14:34.299
We had to read from several different chapters of the Bible.

00:14:34.299 --> 00:14:41.299
Genesis 25, 26, 28, 29, 32.

00:14:41.299 --> 00:14:43.299
You can't always get a complete picture

00:14:43.299 --> 00:14:45.299
of an incident by reading just one chapter,

00:14:45.299 --> 00:14:47.299
just by reading the chapter you're reading.

00:14:47.299 --> 00:14:49.299
Sometimes you have to extract details

00:14:49.299 --> 00:14:52.299
from other chapters of the Bible.

00:14:52.299 --> 00:14:56.840
Now, let's consider one more example.

00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:57.840
We're getting the complete picture

00:14:57.840 --> 00:14:59.840
can enrich our understanding.

00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:01.840
This is going to be a shorter one.

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:04.840
We're going to consider the story of Nehaman.

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:06.840
Now, you remember the story.

00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:09.840
As 2 Kings chapter 5 and verse 1,

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:13.840
we learned that Nehaman was the chief of the army

00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:17.840
of Ben-Hadad II, the king of Syria.

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:19.840
But he was a leper.

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:23.840
Now, Ben-Hadad learned that there was a prophet in Israel,

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:26.840
Elisha, who could heal him of his leprosy.

00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:29.840
And so he told Nehaman that he should go to Israel

00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:32.840
and go to the prophet and get healed.

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:36.840
And so, word was sent to the king of Israel by letter.

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:41.840
And the king of Israel was asked to send Nehaman to Elisha.

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:44.840
Now, when you think of it, this was a strange request.

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:48.840
Because Israel and Syria were often at odds.

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:50.840
Sometimes there were wars between them.

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:54.840
And now, here you have the king of Syria sending his general,

00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:57.840
the one who's going to head the army against Israel,

00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:00.840
and saying, well, I'd like my general to be a more effective general.

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:03.840
Could you please make sure that he gets healed?

00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:06.840
Well, somehow, he sent to Elisha

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:09.840
and Elisha kindly heals Nehaman.

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:14.840
And Nehaman becomes a worshiper of Jehovah.

00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:18.840
Well, we can imagine, remember we're talking about using our imagination,

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:21.840
we can imagine that when Nehaman returned to Syria,

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:27.840
Ben-Hadad said, had lots of nice things to say about Elisha.

00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:31.840
So then, everyone lived happily ever after, right?

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:34.840
If we didn't read on, we might think so.

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:37.840
But that's not the end of the story.

00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:40.840
In the next chapter, chapter 6,

00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:45.840
we learned that Ben-Hadad declared war against Israel.

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:49.840
Now, if Nehaman was still the chief of the army,

00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:51.840
he'd be in an awkward position.

00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:57.840
Was he going to lead the armies of Syria against fellow worshippers of Jehovah?

00:16:57.840 --> 00:16:59.840
But it gets worse.

00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:05.839
Ben-Hadad learns that Elisha is revealing the Syrian's war strategies

00:17:05.839 --> 00:17:07.839
to the king of Israel.

00:17:07.839 --> 00:17:11.839
So he sends a large army to capture Elisha.

00:17:11.839 --> 00:17:15.839
The very man who had healed his general.

00:17:15.839 --> 00:17:17.839
So much for gratitude.

00:17:17.839 --> 00:17:23.839
Now, it's interesting that Nehaman is not mentioned as being at the head of those armies.

00:17:23.839 --> 00:17:26.839
Did he get out of it somehow?

00:17:26.839 --> 00:17:31.839
Don't ask me. If he's resurrected, you'll have to ask him.

00:17:31.839 --> 00:17:34.839
What lesson can we learn?

00:17:34.839 --> 00:17:37.839
That the gratitude of the world is fleeting.

00:17:37.839 --> 00:17:43.839
Some of us may get excited if there's a favorable article about Jehovah's Witnesses in a newspaper

00:17:43.839 --> 00:17:47.839
if some TV personality makes a kind statement about us.

00:17:47.839 --> 00:17:51.839
But what does Jehovah God say? Genesis 3.15?

00:17:51.839 --> 00:17:55.839
I will put enmity between you and the woman.

00:17:55.839 --> 00:18:03.839
So Jehovah's organization and Satan's organization are always going to be at odds.

00:18:03.839 --> 00:18:06.839
Bible reading isn't a chore. It's a joy.

00:18:06.839 --> 00:18:11.839
Get the whole picture of what you're reading and you'll enjoy it even more.

00:18:11.839 --> 00:18:20.839
We wish you all Jehovah's rich blessing as you continue to enhance your appreciation for this sacred volume.
