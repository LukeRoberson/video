00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.929
Being single, you can focus more on other people rather than concentrating on yourself.

00:00:06.929 --> 00:00:13.929
Being single, having more time, more flexibility, really helped me to try to attend this goal,

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:15.929
which was regular pioneering.

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:27.730
Have you singleness as a gift because it opens opportunities to serve more focused and also more flexible?

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:35.729
You can study more, have more time in the field ministry, you have more time for the friends, you're more available.

00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:40.729
Singleness definitely is a gift if it's used in the right way for Jehovah.

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:45.530
Singleness has not always been easy.

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:51.329
Sometimes there comes a period in life, a certain age where people start to ask,

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:58.130
and you find already somebody, you're getting married, and that's not always easy.

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:04.129
Sometimes people look at you and even brothers and sisters and feel a bit of pity for you maybe

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:09.530
because you're still single, and that draws your attention away from what you're doing.

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.530
That sometimes can be difficult.

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.129
I think I got my singleness in the sense that to look out what kind of movies I watch,

00:01:17.129 --> 00:01:22.730
not too romantic because it's easy to go in this type of thinking.

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:30.329
I've always made sure that I associate with a range of brothers and sisters from different age groups,

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.329
but ones that have the similar sort of goals and they have a very positive outlook.

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:40.730
Following Jesus closely as a single, I think it's easier than a couple

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:49.730
because if we reflect on Jesus' life, early rise, a little bit fully focused on the ministry,

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:53.730
on his father, I think it's easier for a single.

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:58.730
He was available to help others, he was available to teach others even for children,

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:01.129
he was available for them to give comfort.

00:02:01.129 --> 00:02:07.329
Jesus was so busy in his ministry and focused, and when you're single you're able to do that,

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:11.729
you're able to concentrate more of your energy and effort into the ministry,

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:14.330
into serving Jehovah more fully.

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.330
It's not a matter of just being single.

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.330
It's a matter of how you use it to support Jehovah's arrangement.

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.330
It doesn't matter whatever age we are.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:29.330
If we are single, use the circumstances that you've got at the moment to do whatever you can

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:34.330
because we're just living in a momentous time, there's so much work for us to do.

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:42.330
Just go and pioneer or do something for Jehovah and wait for him to surprise you.

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:48.330
You can use this time to do all sorts of different things in Jehovah's service at the moment.

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:53.330
There's so many opportunities open up for single ones, including single sisters now,

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:58.330
going where the needs are greater, moving to different countries, serving in Bethel.

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:04.330
So while you've got these circumstances, use the time now because it's wonderful.
