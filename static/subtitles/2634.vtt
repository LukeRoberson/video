00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.919
Theocratic schools are equipping more and more of our brothers and sisters with a strong

00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:09.560
spiritual foundation.

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:14.560
After graduation, they're able to fill needed assignments in the organization.

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:19.920
For example, the School for Kingdom Evangelizers is training ones who make themselves available

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.600
to serve where the harvest is great, often within their own branch territory.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:31.320
That's the situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where over one million people attended

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.079
last year's memorial, that's more than five times the number of publishers.

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.960
Because of this tremendous need in the field and the lack of other facilities to conduct

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:47.719
theocratic schools and house the students, an exception was made to have a dedicated school

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:49.719
facility.

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:57.460
Now things are different after a busy renovation and an exciting dedication program.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:04.299
In the very heart of Africa lies the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Republic of Congo.

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:07.019
Jehovah's creation brings praise to him.

00:01:07.019 --> 00:01:11.459
However, the greatest shout-out to praise to Jehovah comes from the more than 200,000

00:01:11.459 --> 00:01:18.019
Jehovah's Witnesses who are zealously preaching and teaching the good news of the kingdom.

00:01:18.019 --> 00:01:25.260
In our branch territory, over 40,000 were baptized in the last three years.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.379
This means the formation of many new congregations.

00:01:29.379 --> 00:01:36.019
This accelerated growth produces a need for more qualified brothers and sisters.

00:01:36.019 --> 00:01:40.140
We needed a school facility that could satisfy this growing need.

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.980
Due to economic reasons and a great number of potential students in the Congo, the

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:50.140
governing body made a loving exception and decided that we could have a school for

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.299
Kingdom Evangelize with two classrooms.

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:57.659
We were so happy when we received the approval to go ahead and renovate some buildings

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.819
located near to Bethel.

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:04.019
International and local volunteers went very hard to renovate the buildings into a

00:02:04.019 --> 00:02:10.020
theocratic school complex that would bring praise to Jehovah God.

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.219
This school's complex is unique because it's an oasis of order and cleanliness in an

00:02:15.219 --> 00:02:16.819
overcrowded city.

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:20.860
One day a passerby got a glimpse of the school because the gates were left open.

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.259
He was so impressed with the well-maintained buildings, the beautiful garden setting and

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:27.979
the sign, Bible school's complex.

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:31.539
He came right in and asked if he could enroll in the school.

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:37.259
On January 17, 2015, Brother Garrett Loesch of the governing body dedicated the complex

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:41.659
to Jehovah with the theme, growth, praises, Jehovah.

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:45.620
I would never have thought this could happen 15 years ago, that a member of the governing

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.500
body would come to dedicate this building that has been used for many things but now

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.699
the pinnacle of school.

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:57.699
We are very happy, Jehovah is really the creator.

00:02:57.699 --> 00:03:02.900
51 students were invited from all over Congo for the first and second classes of the school

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.020
for kingdom evangelizers.

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:10.060
For many of the students, it is the first time to see a theocratic school facility of Bethel

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.500
for that matter.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:19.340
I couldn't believe my eyes when Jehovah granted me one of the desires of my heart to attend

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.460
this school for kingdom evangelizers.

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:30.419
In Isaiah 54-13, the Bible says, every son will be taught by Jehovah.

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:35.620
I felt very privileged to have been chosen by the branch committee to learn more about

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.900
Jehovah and his organization.

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.060
The students will never forget that they enjoyed three good meals served to them graciously

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:50.139
each day, that their clothes were washed and well pressed, that they enjoyed a modern

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:54.659
air-conditioned classroom in the tropics with computers and printers freely available for

00:03:54.659 --> 00:04:00.500
their use, also that they slept in safety at night in clean rooms.

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.020
Do you have the spirit of an evangelizer?

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:06.900
We believe that you do have it.

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.500
In general, secular school education can make people more proud.

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.900
This divine education helps the students to be more humble and thus more useful in

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.699
Jehovah's hands.

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:27.420
I understand better now how much Jehovah appreciate humble people, but he opposes the proud.

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:35.139
I am very small at home of dust, so there is no need for me to think I am better than

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:36.939
someone else.

00:04:36.939 --> 00:04:42.220
The training helped me to look at myself honestly, I discovered parts of my personality,

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.939
I needed to improve.

00:04:44.939 --> 00:04:54.939
I have the privilege to take care of this school complex, I saw the quality of divine education

00:04:54.939 --> 00:05:01.699
with my own eyes now, I am motivated to try even harder to make the experience pleasant

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:06.500
for any future students and thus bring praise to Jehovah.

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:12.220
It helped me to cherish my place in Jehovah's organization to love Jehovah and my brothers

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:14.420
and sisters even more.

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:22.779
The school helps the students not just to help new ones, but also to work along with

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:31.420
the other publishers so they also can progress and stabilize in the faith.

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:36.060
I make a new foot to show the training with others in the congregation.

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:40.379
I like to encourage the young one to take up the pioneer service.

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:45.620
With the training I have received, I found it easier to approach anyone.

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:51.379
I am conducting several barber studies and some of them are attending meetings.

00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:57.180
The divine education that I received helped me to have a clearer understanding of the

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:58.180
truth.

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:02.540
I am also much more effective in my ministry.

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:09.060
Deborah and Kathy were assigned to a distant isolated territory, 1,500 kilometres up the

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:11.379
River Congo in northern Congo.

00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:16.779
In the congregation, the brothers were surprised because they know usually this school we sent

00:06:16.779 --> 00:06:23.019
out brothers, but it was two sisters, but now they see that we help the congregation.

00:06:23.019 --> 00:06:29.259
Yes, we were very happy when our second Oversea informed us that two sisters were coming

00:06:29.259 --> 00:06:30.980
to our congregation.

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:31.980
We were very happy.

00:06:32.459 --> 00:06:35.339
They encourage other sisters in the congregation.

00:06:35.339 --> 00:06:42.180
Also, they add enthusiasm to the congregation, especially in the ministry.

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:47.939
The presence of these graduates in the various congregations has helped to improve the quality

00:06:47.939 --> 00:06:52.899
of teaching and energize the preaching activity.

00:06:52.899 --> 00:06:57.980
The benefits reached the far corners of Congo, so that a great shot of praise is given to

00:06:57.980 --> 00:06:58.980
your home.

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:03.139
What a blessing from Tyrova.

00:07:03.139 --> 00:07:08.379
Every year, more than 200 brothers and sisters can receive divine education from Tyrova.

00:07:08.379 --> 00:07:21.009
And then, it's first disover the far reaching territory of the Congo branch.

00:07:21.009 --> 00:07:26.490
How encouraging it is to see the school for Kingdom evangelizers in Congo is now able to

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:28.449
move forward with Tyrova's blessing.
