00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:06.360
Throughout history, mankind has been in a constant struggle for freedom,

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:12.099
men have fought for freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom of the press,

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:15.000
and freedom from bondage and slavery.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.079
Man's perception of freedom is shaped by his environment,

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:26.100
his personal situation, and even his age.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:31.100
While growing up, I remember the boys in my neighborhood getting together

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:39.100
on the final day of summer vacation to enjoy what we called our last day of freedom baseball game.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.100
We called it that because school started the next day.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.100
But this matter of freedom is not a game.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:53.100
Our view of freedom is a matter of life and death.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.100
No matter what our personal feelings or needs are regarding freedom,

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.100
we must recognize one fundamental fact.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:06.099
Basically, there are only two kinds of freedom.

00:01:06.099 --> 00:01:14.099
True freedom from Jehovah and false freedom that is offered by Satan and his world.

00:01:14.099 --> 00:01:19.099
Every person must make a choice between these two freedoms.

00:01:19.099 --> 00:01:28.099
Let's consider what each of these freedoms represents and how our choice affects our prospect for eternal life.

00:01:28.099 --> 00:01:31.099
Please open your Bibles to Matthew 7.

00:01:31.099 --> 00:01:35.099
We're going to read verses 13 and 14.

00:01:35.099 --> 00:01:40.099
And here we read an illustration that Jesus gave in the Sermon on the Mount.

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:45.099
And in the illustration, he speaks about two gates and two roads.

00:01:45.099 --> 00:01:50.099
And this also relates to the two freedoms that we're discussing this morning.

00:01:50.099 --> 00:01:55.099
Matthew 7 verses 13 and 14.

00:01:55.099 --> 00:02:03.099
He said, go in through the narrow gate because broad is the gate and spacious is the road leading off into destruction.

00:02:03.099 --> 00:02:06.099
And many are going in through it.

00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:11.099
Whereas narrow is the gate and cramped the road leading off into life.

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:16.150
And few are finding it.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:23.150
At first glance, this spacious road may appear to be the road to true freedom.

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.150
Why? Because it's easy to travel.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:32.150
Travelers on this road can go where they please, think as they please, live as they please.

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:37.150
There aren't any restrictions, no rules, no commitments.

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:42.150
And it's not surprising when we realize that one definition of freedom

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:49.150
is the ability or capacity to act without undue hindrance or restraint.

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:55.150
But this is the freedom that Satan and his world have to offer.

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.150
But is it real freedom?

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.150
Please open to Ephesians 2.

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.150
We're going to read verses 2 and 3.

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:11.150
This scripture describes the situation of people who choose to enter that broad gate

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.150
and then walk the spacious road.

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:18.150
Ephesians 2, verses 2 and 3, describes them this way.

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:23.150
In which you at one time walked according to the system of things of this world,

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.150
according to the ruler of the authority of the heir,

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:33.150
the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience.

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:39.150
Yes, among them we all at one time conducted ourselves in harmony with the desires of our flesh,

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:44.150
carrying out the will of the flesh and of our thoughts.

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:50.150
And we were naturally children of wrath just as the rest.

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:56.150
Did you notice that the ones walking on this road are not free at all?

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:02.150
They have a ruler, the ruler of the authority of the heir, Satan the devil,

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.150
and they also have a master.

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.150
They carry out the will of the flesh.

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:13.150
They are slaves of the flesh and its desires.

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:19.149
Please turn to 2 Peter 2 and we'll read verse 19.

00:04:19.149 --> 00:04:28.149
These words confirm that Satan's promise of freedom is a false promise that results in slavery.

00:04:28.149 --> 00:04:35.149
2 Peter 2 and verse 19 says while they are promising them freedom,

00:04:35.149 --> 00:04:38.149
they themselves are slaves of corruption.

00:04:38.149 --> 00:04:46.149
For if anyone is overcome by someone, he is his slave.

00:04:46.149 --> 00:04:50.149
Satan's road is not the road of true freedom.

00:04:50.149 --> 00:04:54.149
Also, it's not a free way.

00:04:54.149 --> 00:04:57.149
In fact, it's a toll road.

00:04:57.149 --> 00:05:02.149
And the toll to walk on this road is very heavy.

00:05:02.149 --> 00:05:09.149
This permissive broad road takes its toll in sexually transmitted diseases, broken homes,

00:05:09.149 --> 00:05:18.149
bodies and minds that are sick with drug and alcohol abuse, and acts of violence.

00:05:18.149 --> 00:05:28.149
This toll is way too expensive just to walk on a dead end street that ends in destruction.

00:05:28.149 --> 00:05:32.149
But now what about the other road that Jesus talked about?

00:05:32.149 --> 00:05:36.149
He said the gate is narrow and the road is cramped.

00:05:36.149 --> 00:05:41.149
Why does so few people choose to walk this road?

00:05:41.149 --> 00:05:48.149
Primarily because very few people today want God's laws and principles to govern their lives.

00:05:48.149 --> 00:05:56.149
True, this road has boundaries, but those boundaries help the ones who walk the road to avoid wrongdoing,

00:05:56.149 --> 00:06:05.149
to fight wrong desires, to resist peer pressure in the fear of ridicule that may come as a result of walking this road.

00:06:05.149 --> 00:06:09.149
The broad road is centered on self.

00:06:09.149 --> 00:06:16.149
Self-indulgence, self-awareness, self-fulfillment, self-interest.

00:06:16.149 --> 00:06:25.149
In contrast, this narrow road calls for self-control, self-denial, hard work,

00:06:25.149 --> 00:06:27.149
and respect for authority.

00:06:27.149 --> 00:06:32.149
But this is the road to true freedom.

00:06:32.149 --> 00:06:40.149
Interestingly, some scriptures that talk about the freedom Jehovah gives may appear to be a little bit confusing.

00:06:40.149 --> 00:06:46.149
For example, let's open to 1 Peter 2 and verse 16.

00:06:46.149 --> 00:06:53.149
And as we read it, notice the contrasting expressions in this scripture.

00:06:53.149 --> 00:06:56.149
1 Peter 2 verse 16.

00:06:56.149 --> 00:07:07.149
It says, be as free people using your freedom, not as a cover for doing wrong, but as slaves of God.

00:07:07.149 --> 00:07:14.149
How interesting that we can be free and be a slave at the same time.

00:07:14.149 --> 00:07:20.149
For most people, the idea of becoming a slave to anyone or anything is not appealing.

00:07:20.149 --> 00:07:25.149
However, there are positive aspects to being a slave.

00:07:25.149 --> 00:07:28.149
Let's consider an example.

00:07:28.149 --> 00:07:35.149
In Israel, a man who fell into debt could sell himself as a slave to pay off his debt.

00:07:35.149 --> 00:07:38.149
But this wasn't a permanent arrangement.

00:07:38.149 --> 00:07:44.149
He was to be freed after seven years or in a Jubilee year, whichever came first.

00:07:44.149 --> 00:07:49.149
While serving as a slave, he was treated like a hired man.

00:07:49.149 --> 00:07:52.149
He was protected from abuse.

00:07:52.149 --> 00:07:59.149
And when he was released, his master gave him a gift to help him get back on his feet.

00:07:59.149 --> 00:08:02.149
This was Jehovah's arrangement.

00:08:02.149 --> 00:08:08.149
So it gives us a glimpse of what it's like to be a slave for Jehovah.

00:08:08.149 --> 00:08:17.149
The life of an Israelite slave could be so secure that the slave chose to remain with his master for life.

00:08:17.149 --> 00:08:23.149
The arrangement is described at Exodus chapter 21 verses 5 and 6 where it says,

00:08:23.149 --> 00:08:29.149
but if the slave should insist and say, I love my master, my wife, and my sons.

00:08:29.149 --> 00:08:31.149
I do not want to be set free.

00:08:31.149 --> 00:08:34.149
His master must bring him before the true God.

00:08:34.149 --> 00:08:38.149
Then he will bring him up against the door or the door post,

00:08:38.149 --> 00:08:41.149
and his master will pierce his ear through with an all.

00:08:41.149 --> 00:08:46.149
And he will be his slave for life.

00:08:46.149 --> 00:08:48.149
We are like that slave.

00:08:48.149 --> 00:08:54.149
Our love for Jehovah and our appreciation for the true freedom he gives

00:08:54.149 --> 00:08:59.149
are so strong that we give our lives to him.

00:08:59.149 --> 00:09:04.149
We identify ourselves as Jehovah's slaves, not by getting our ears pierced,

00:09:04.149 --> 00:09:08.149
but by dedication and baptism.

00:09:08.149 --> 00:09:12.149
When it comes to freedom, we almost make a choice.

00:09:12.149 --> 00:09:17.149
Do we take the broad road of false freedom offered by Satan and his world?

00:09:17.149 --> 00:09:21.149
Remember, it's literally a dead end street.

00:09:21.149 --> 00:09:31.149
Or do we take the narrow road of true freedom that road is defined by God's righteous standards?

00:09:31.149 --> 00:09:35.149
And this is the road that leads to everlasting life.

00:09:35.149 --> 00:09:40.149
Even now we've been freed from fear of the future and the superstitious fear of death.

00:09:40.149 --> 00:09:47.149
We've been freed from the pains that result from a lifestyle that ignores God's standards.

00:09:47.149 --> 00:09:53.149
The freedom Jehovah provides will eventually give the human family all of the basic freedoms

00:09:53.149 --> 00:09:58.149
that honest-hearted people long for today.

00:09:58.149 --> 00:10:03.149
Freedom from fear, freedom from crime, freedom from hunger, from poverty,

00:10:03.149 --> 00:10:06.149
pollution, sickness, and war.

00:10:06.149 --> 00:10:10.149
May we continue to walk on the road of true freedom ourselves

00:10:10.149 --> 00:10:17.149
and help others to find the true freedom that only Jehovah can give.
