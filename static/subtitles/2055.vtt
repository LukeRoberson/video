00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:23.219
I grew up near New Bedford, Massachusetts.

00:00:23.219 --> 00:00:26.960
My family is originally from the Azores and Scotland.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:41.170
It's not easy being different, especially when you're young.

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.670
When you're deaf, your whole world depends on sight.

00:00:44.670 --> 00:01:01.600
Well, James was born deaf and that was difficult enough to have to learn how to cope with

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:07.739
and how to teach him and how to help him.

00:01:07.739 --> 00:01:11.980
And then shortly after that, when he was about seven years old, we noticed that his eyesight

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.189
was feeling.

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:21.969
The first time we went to the doctor, they were really able to tell much, except that

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:30.269
he wasn't doing good with the eye shot, being alone, was one of the challenges James

00:01:30.269 --> 00:01:31.269
faced.

00:01:31.269 --> 00:01:42.980
I'm losing some of the friends he used to play with, that he no longer could play with.

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:48.500
I lost my sight at age 8 because of a retinal detachment.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:02:02.719
I felt frustrated and bitter.

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:06.659
When I enter a place, I begin to feel around the room.

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:14.669
I make a mountain picture where everything is so that I can move around freely.

00:02:14.669 --> 00:02:19.629
Sometimes people are surprised with what interests me.

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:24.810
I can enjoy activities just like any other person.

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.689
I have a heightened sense of touch.

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:32.219
I see things with my hands.

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:39.099
James approaches life in a more sensitive contemplative way because light is not a part

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:44.539
of his experience, but it doesn't change the ability that he has to learn from the same

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:51.990
things that we all learn from.

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:57.189
Learning to read Braille was a very important step in my life.

00:02:57.189 --> 00:03:01.229
I was in June of 1976.

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:05.509
I remember traveling to Perkins for my interview.

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:14.830
I was so nervous and I wasn't sure what it was going to be like.

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:21.379
I worked with JR for 12 years.

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:26.580
Someone who is totally deaf-blind is really isolated from everything around them unless you're

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:34.259
in immediate contact with them.

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:42.509
I was taught how to use my hands so that I could function without the use of my eyes.

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:49.270
I learned how to read Braille in English and I was taught American Sign Language.

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:56.180
These helped me to communicate with others.

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:08.539
I've always been interested in the universe, the stars, the planets, and their moons.

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:14.460
I was always asking who made people the ocean and the trees, the ground, and everything

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:17.329
around us.

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:22.209
I try to understand my surroundings by touch, smell and taste.

00:04:22.209 --> 00:04:35.600
I can't see light, but I can sense the warmth of the sun on my skin.

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:43.819
When I was 10 years old, I received my first copy of the Bible in Braille.

00:04:43.819 --> 00:04:50.870
It gives me comfort and teaches me so many things.

00:04:50.870 --> 00:05:03.370
The carvings that I collect are for me the same as pictures you may hang in your home.

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.810
I employ James two days a week to be our chef.

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:18.910
He has a strong, strong faith in God and I think that has gotten him through a lot of struggles.

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:24.459
Attending the Kingdom Hall keeps me positive.

00:05:24.459 --> 00:05:29.139
These are places of worship for Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:33.660
I have friends there that are just like family.

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:36.500
I'm assigned to work with the literature.

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:41.579
I deliver magazines and DVDs to the brothers.

00:05:41.579 --> 00:05:48.509
I can recognize people just by the touch of their hands.

00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:52.189
Conventions are special times of the year.

00:05:52.189 --> 00:05:56.269
I get to be around people just like me.

00:05:56.269 --> 00:06:04.500
We receive spiritual instruction as well as new publications in Braille.

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:09.100
No matter if you're blind or deaf or can see in here,

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:16.689
it's important to develop our ability to reason and use our imagination.

00:06:16.689 --> 00:06:21.449
Well, you know, I have always said that if God says to me,

00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:25.889
these are the children and you can pick which baby will be yours.

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:27.930
This one's going to be a football player.

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:30.089
This one's going to be a movie star.

00:06:30.089 --> 00:06:32.649
This one's going to be deaf and blind.

00:06:32.649 --> 00:06:34.769
I never would have picked James.

00:06:34.769 --> 00:06:38.449
And I would have missed out on having the best son in the world.

00:06:38.449 --> 00:06:43.529
Finding out who my creator is and that I can have a relationship with him

00:06:43.529 --> 00:06:46.449
gave my life a sense of purpose.

00:06:46.449 --> 00:06:51.930
I feel like I've gained much more than I've ever lost.
