00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:09.750
My theme for this little discussion is husbands love your wife as yourself.

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.750
What did Jesus say was a second greatest commandment?

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:19.750
Well, you're familiar with it. In Matthew 22,39, he said,

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.750
you must love your neighbor as yourself.

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:28.750
Now, what an excellent illustration is contained in this second greatest commandment.

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:33.750
If you think about it, we just naturally inherently love ourselves, don't we?

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.750
And we show that love in many ways.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:43.750
So Jesus is saying, work hard to show the same love for others you show for yourself.

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.750
But now thinking of husbands as addressed in our theme,

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.750
who is a husband's closest neighbor? Well, his wife.

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:59.750
So especially must the husband work hard to show the love he shows for himself just naturally

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.750
to show that love for his wife.

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:07.750
Now, what are some specific ways that husbands just naturally love themselves?

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.750
Well, let's talk about five.

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.750
And undoubtedly, you could think of many others.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.750
It could be discussed during this discussion.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.750
But number one, a husband feeds himself.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.750
Ephesians 5 verse 29 says in part,

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:30.750
for no man ever hated his own body, but he feeds it.

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.750
Well, what does loving our wife now as ourself require?

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:43.750
Well, for one thing, we certainly would make sure we provide the food and other material needs that our wife has.

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:50.750
And regarding this, I think of our brothers in concentration camps in Nazi Germany.

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.750
Food was very scarce.

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:59.750
But our brothers even then from their meager food ration would share food with other brothers,

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.750
even in some cases with worldly people.

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:10.750
Well, similarly, a husband would do without himself, if necessary, in order to provide what his wife really needs.

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:18.750
But even more importantly, in extended application, he would make sure that she is well fed spiritually.

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:24.750
He must make sure that she has opportunity to benefit from periods of personal study,

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.750
congregation meetings, assemblies, conventions, and family worship.

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:35.750
But now, let's talk about a second way that a husband just naturally loves himself.

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.750
We cherish ourselves.

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:48.750
Ephesians 529 says in part, for no man ever hated his own body, but he cherishes it.

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.750
Now, what does cherish mean?

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:57.750
Well, according to the dictionary, it means to treat with affection and tenderness.

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.750
Treasure, value, attach importance to.

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:09.750
See, because of this feeling we have toward ourselves, we try to get rest when we're sick or tired.

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.750
We try to be with friends and loved ones.

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.750
We play games, we exercise, we do things we enjoy.

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.750
Periodically, we treat ourselves, don't we?

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.750
Because we cherish ourselves.

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.750
So, what does loving our wife as our self require?

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.750
Well, it certainly means more than just being able to put up with our mate.

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:37.750
It means cherishing her, cultivating affection, fondness for her.

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:48.750
I think of this in Proverbs 831, it says that Jesus in His prehuman existence was fond of humans.

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.750
Now, don't you think that fondness He had for us made it easier for him to come to the earth,

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:58.750
take the difficult assignment He took, and even die for us because He was fond of us?

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:06.750
Well, similarly, if wives are cherished by their husbands, if their husbands are fond of their wives,

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:13.750
it'll make it so much easier to forgive them, to even die for them if necessary in the future.

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:22.750
But if we're going to have this proper feeling like Jehovah, we have to focus on the good qualities of our wife.

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.750
See, not the flaws, the imperfections.

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:30.750
And as one of the brothers commented on, I love the thoughts in the Watchtower comments,

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:34.750
love is best sensed when it is expressed.

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:45.750
How vital that marriage mates not allow the activities of daily life to rob them of exchanging expressions of affection.

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:50.750
Now, let's get a third way that husbands just naturally love themselves.

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:53.750
We adorn ourselves.

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:59.750
First Timothy 2.9 speaks of women adorning themselves in appropriate dress.

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.750
Well, husbands try to do the same thing.

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:09.750
And in adorning ourselves, we try to cover over, minimize our flaws,

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.750
cover our bulges, our blemishes.

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:16.750
We try to make ourselves look as good as possible, don't we?

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:20.750
Well, what does loving our wife as ourself require?

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:24.750
For one thing, we certainly wouldn't shine a spotlight on her flaws.

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:27.750
We wouldn't do this in the presence of others.

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:30.750
We would try hard not to even do it in her own mind.

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:37.750
Rather, we seek to cover over minor sins and transgressions as encouraged at Proverbs 1911,

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:43.750
where it says it is beauty to overlook and offense.

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:46.750
So we work hard to adorn our wives.

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:52.750
Make her look as good as possible in the eyes of others, even in her own mind.

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:57.750
Well, let's get a fourth way that husbands just naturally love themselves.

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:02.750
We take steps to heal ourselves when we're sick or injured.

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:07.750
Mark 526 talks about a woman who is very sick.

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:09.750
She suffered at the hands of many physicians.

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:12.750
She's been all her resources. She didn't eat any better.

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:13.750
She got worse.

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:17.750
But the point is, she was really trying hard to heal herself.

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:20.750
Well, husbands try to do the same thing.

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:23.750
So if we're sick or injured, we try to get extra rest.

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:25.750
We'll buy medicine.

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:27.750
We'll take vitamins.

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:29.750
We'll make an appointment with a doctor.

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:31.750
We'll pursue therapy.

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:34.750
See, we try to get well.

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:38.750
What does loving our wife as ourself require then?

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:41.750
Well, we would certainly do all within our power if she's sick or injured.

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:44.750
Try to help her get well.

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:48.750
But even more importantly, if she happens to be ailing somewhat spiritually,

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:50.750
we would do everything.

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:54.750
We can possibly do to help her get well spiritually.

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:57.750
What would be something perhaps we could do?

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:02.750
Well, proverb 1218 says the tongue of the wise is a healing.

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:06.750
So the using of wise expressions.

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:12.750
Also, proverb 1624, pleasant sayings are a honeycomb sweet to the soul

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:16.750
and a healing to the bones.

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:22.750
So pleasant sayings, we would use these to try to help her get well spiritually.

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:27.750
But now, here's one more, a fifth way that husbands just naturally love themselves.

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:33.750
We make allowances excuses if we make mistakes.

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:40.750
Husbands who make mistakes are often heard blaming it on their heredity.

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:43.750
Or maybe the environment.

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:45.750
Their blood sugar level.

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:51.100
How much sleep they got or didn't get the night before.

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:55.100
The weather and so forth.

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:59.100
We tend to well understand our own limitations, don't we?

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:01.100
And we allow for that.

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:03.100
Well, what about loving our wife as ourself?

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:05.100
We'd make the same allowances for her.

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:09.100
Being positive, imputing good motives to her.

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:13.100
If she speaks a little roughly, acts a little thoughtlessly.

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:19.100
We'll try to discern the feelings behind the words or actions.

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:21.100
We'll make allowance.

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:26.100
Especially if we can discern that she's under some kind of emotional pressure.

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:30.100
We'll make that allowance for her like we would for ourselves.

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:35.100
Well, there we have five ways that husbands show love for ourselves.

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:41.100
We feed, cherish, adorn, try to heal ourselves.

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:46.100
And we make allowances excuses when we make mistakes.

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:55.100
Let's work hard to show the same love, those five areas for our dear beloved wives.

00:08:55.100 --> 00:09:00.100
And I'm sure as we said, you can think of other ways that husbands just naturally love themselves.

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:03.100
But what a rich illustration Jesus gave.

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:06.100
And interestingly, he took it even a step further.

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:12.100
He further expanded the illustration in John 13 and verse 34.

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:14.100
You're familiar with this.

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:15.100
1334.

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:24.100
He said, I'm giving you a new commandment that you love one another just as I have loved you.

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:27.100
You also love one another.

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:32.100
So he's saying that we should even have deeper love for our brothers,

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:38.100
which would definitely include our Christian wives, deeper love than we have for ourselves.

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:47.100
And that deeper love would move us to treat our dear wives even better than we treat ourselves.
