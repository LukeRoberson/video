00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:04.549
Greed.

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:11.949
Everything that this word represents goes against the very fiber of our Christian personality.

00:00:11.949 --> 00:00:20.030
Greed is defined as a selfish and excessive desire for more of something than is needed.

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:26.949
The Japanese word for Greed is donyoku, and it's formed by joining two Chinese characters.

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:32.670
The verse character means to covet, to lust insatiably.

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:39.869
The second character means to have a passion, a desire, or a craving for something.

00:00:39.869 --> 00:00:44.310
Put them together, and donyoku is not a very nice word.

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:50.909
To learn more about Greed, let's turn to Colossians chapter 3, verse 5.

00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:58.189
We often quote this scripture to show the need to avoid sexual immorality, but it also

00:00:58.189 --> 00:01:06.750
reveals that Greed is a serious sin, just how serious Colossians 3.5 says,

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.790
Didn't therefore your body members that are on the earth is respect sexual immorality,

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:22.390
uncleanness, uncontrolled sexual passion, hurtful desire, and greediness, which is idolatry.

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:28.150
Now why does Jehovah equate Greed with idolatry?

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.510
Greed is desire out of control.

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:39.230
If we lose control of our desires, those desires become our master, the thing that we serve,

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:44.349
in effect, those desires become our God.

00:01:44.349 --> 00:01:51.549
We put those desires ahead of our worship of Jehovah, and that is idolatry.

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:57.150
But is it idolatry to want a bigger house, or perhaps a newer car?

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:03.590
Not necessarily, a family with five children may have good reason to want a bigger house,

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:10.669
or a pioneer serving in rural territory with an old rundown car may have a legitimate

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:15.270
need for more dependable transportation.

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:22.509
So just how do we determine whether we have crossed that line between normal desire and

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:24.270
greed?

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.389
One way to do this is to ask ourselves two questions.

00:02:28.389 --> 00:02:34.789
First question, what is my heart attitude that makes me want something?

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:41.590
And the second question, is this thing really necessary?

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.509
An illustration also will help us to determine whether we have crossed the line.

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:50.789
The difference between normal desire and greed has been likened to the difference

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:56.270
between a small campfire and a raging forest fire.

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:02.069
Normal desires are like a campfire that cooks our food and warms us on a cool night.

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:09.750
But greed is like a wind-driven forest fire that tries to consume everything in its path.

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:16.030
Their numerous examples in the Bible of those who let their desires get out of control.

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:24.789
Adam and Eve, Aiken, Baelum, Gehezai, the Israelites who collected quail, and yes, Judas

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:26.710
is scary it.

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:33.349
So greed poses a serious danger even to servants of Jehovah.

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:39.469
Titus chapter 1, verse 7, and 1 Timothy chapter 3, verse 8, identify greed as something

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:44.909
that would disqualify a brother from serving as an elder or a ministerial servant in the

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:46.870
congregation.

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:52.590
This implies that some Christians in the first century may have been contaminated by the

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.909
spirit of greed.

00:03:54.909 --> 00:04:03.110
Today, we live in a world that is driven by greed, so it's vital that we avoid becoming

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:09.509
consumed by this degrading, un-Christian trait.

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:18.230
We can do this, first of all, by keeping our desires under control, and second by stain-focused

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:20.389
on spiritual matters.

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:24.829
Jesus made that clear in the context of today's text.

00:04:24.829 --> 00:04:33.670
Let's open to Luke chapter 12 and examine what was it that prompted Jesus to warn against

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:36.629
greed in verse 15.

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:44.250
In Luke chapter 12, first of all, in verse 1, we notice that Jesus cautioned his listeners

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.569
against the hypocrisy of the Pharisees.

00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:50.170
We go down to verses 4 and 5.

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:55.089
Notice that he told them not to fear those who can kill the body, but cannot take away

00:04:55.089 --> 00:04:57.930
our prospects of eternal life.

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:04.050
Then in verses 6 and 7, he assured his disciples that they were worth more than many sparrows.

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:09.730
And in verse 12, he promised them that as they preached, Holy Spirit would help them

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:11.970
to bear witness.

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:13.730
These were serious subjects.

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:19.370
They were things that the disciples and the crowd that had gathered needed to hear.

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:21.370
But then what happened?

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:27.129
Look at verse 13, suddenly a young man blurt's out, Teacher, tell my brother to divide the

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:29.649
inheritance with me.

00:05:29.649 --> 00:05:33.930
That be like us listening to a talk at a convention, and suddenly somebody stands up in

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:40.730
the audience and shouts, tell brother so-and-so to pay me the money that he owes me.

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:44.970
We probably think, where in the world did that come from?

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:51.610
In the case of the young man in Jesus, we do well to ask, was that young man even listening

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:54.009
to what Jesus was saying?

00:05:54.009 --> 00:05:55.009
Probably not.

00:05:55.009 --> 00:06:01.490
He was too focused on getting Jesus involved in his personal financial matter.

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:04.129
So what was his problem?

00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:08.089
The law of Moses was clear on matters of inheritance.

00:06:08.089 --> 00:06:12.769
And even if this young man had a legitimate complaint, this certainly was not the time

00:06:12.769 --> 00:06:16.250
nor the place to bring it up.

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:23.810
Obviously, he had a serious lack of appreciation for spiritual matters.

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:29.490
Now the account doesn't reveal the degree of greed in this young man's heart, but apparently

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:34.449
he had crossed that line between normal desires and greed.

00:06:34.449 --> 00:06:41.730
And Jesus detected a serious spiritual deficiency and used the example of this young man to

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:46.009
illustrate the dangers of greed.

00:06:46.009 --> 00:06:51.009
After warning the audience to guard against every sort of greed in verse 15, Jesus then

00:06:51.009 --> 00:06:58.250
related the thought-provoking illustration of the rich man whose land produced well.

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:01.089
Now is there a lesson in this for us?

00:07:01.089 --> 00:07:02.569
Definitely.

00:07:02.569 --> 00:07:07.370
We may be sitting in a Christian meeting and suddenly realize that our mind is wandered

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:12.329
into areas that have nothing to do with what's coming from the platform.

00:07:12.329 --> 00:07:17.889
If that should happen, it would be good to examine what was it that distracted us,

00:07:17.889 --> 00:07:22.050
was it something material that we were thinking about?

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:27.649
And we should consider whether this might be an indication that sparks from our campfire

00:07:27.649 --> 00:07:33.170
have started jumping out and perhaps starting a bigger fire.

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:38.730
How can those of us in special full-time service be on guard to ensure that we do not cross

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:44.290
the line between normal desire and greed?

00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:48.209
Our personal financial resources are limited.

00:07:48.209 --> 00:07:52.889
And perhaps we'd really like to have the latest model of an electronic device.

00:07:52.889 --> 00:07:55.850
Maybe we'd like to travel to an international convention.

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:59.569
When we go to our brother's home and they bring out their latest acquisitions and start

00:07:59.569 --> 00:08:05.810
talking about their travel plans, well, if they take the initiative and offer such things

00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:15.149
to us, we may choose graciously and gratefully to accept, however, we would never want to

00:08:15.149 --> 00:08:20.810
drop hints of how much we would like to have this or do that.

00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:26.449
Instead, we keep our campfire under control.

00:08:26.449 --> 00:08:30.810
Please open to 1 Timothy chapter 6, we'll read verses 6 through 8.

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:37.470
And as we read the scripture, let's look for a quality that will help us to avoid the

00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:39.730
trap of greed.

00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:44.289
1 Timothy chapter 6 verses 6 through 8.

00:08:44.289 --> 00:08:51.330
To be sure, there is great gain in godly devotion along with contentment.

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:55.490
For we have brought nothing into the world and neither can we carry anything out.

00:08:55.490 --> 00:09:01.730
So having food and clothing, we will be content with these things.
