00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:13.039
The persecution spread throughout Malawi soon after the announcement was made that the witnesses were banned in the country.

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:22.039
The truth is that people who call themselves Jehovah's Witness are not Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:25.039
They are the devils witness.

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:36.450
Their houses were banned and their maids crops were confiscated because they refused to participate in the country's politics.

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:49.450
The regular visits that brother Johansson was doing as a branch representative at that time really encouraged the brothers from various parts of the country who were affected by the persecution.

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:59.729
His wife Linda suggested that he should ask someone to accompany him so that he did not have to do the work alone.

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:03.729
And she suggested that I accompany him.

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:06.730
This was because of the fear of what might happen.

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:16.379
When we got to the ferry crossing, the soldiers told brother Johansson to get out and stand in front of the jeep.

00:01:16.379 --> 00:01:23.629
They said to me, you can pass but we first have to shoot the white man.

00:01:24.629 --> 00:01:33.629
Because the scriptures say, no one is greater loved than this, that someone should surrender his life in behalf of his friends.

00:01:33.629 --> 00:01:37.629
I said, shoot me instead. What did this man do?

00:01:37.629 --> 00:01:49.299
Yes, it happened without giving it a second thought. It just happened spontaneously. I stood between him and the soldiers.

00:01:53.019 --> 00:02:01.019
Fear, not very much. Because the people that we thought were going to Hammers had a complete change of heart.

00:02:01.019 --> 00:02:08.960
On the way back brother Johansson also saved my life.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:15.960
We were stopped by a youth mob at a roadblock. They asked for the political cards. They would have killed me.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.960
So brother Johansson just spared off with his vehicle.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:27.960
Yes, it was very exciting to see that Jehovah God has many ways of saving his people.

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:34.960
Alicia said, for they are more who are with us than those who are with them.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:39.960
In the end, Jehovah will rescue his people.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:48.960
So, in countries where our brothers have been, I encourage them to stand firm trusting in God the God who never fails.
