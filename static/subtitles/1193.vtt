00:00:01.169 --> 00:00:06.169
In the present system of things, all of us experience trials.

00:00:06.169 --> 00:00:10.169
Do you ever wonder whether Jehovah will act in your behalf?

00:00:10.169 --> 00:00:13.169
And if so, when?

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:18.170
We can be certain that Jehovah will support us during our trials.

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:19.170
Why?

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:26.170
Because Jehovah's foremost attribute is an especially heartwarming quality, love.

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:31.170
To learn about this quality, including how we can show it ourselves,

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.170
let's examine the Bible account of Joseph.

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:41.170
Joseph was born more than 3,700 years ago in Mesopotamia.

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:46.170
His father was the patriarch Jacob, also known as Israel.

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:52.170
Joseph had ten-half brothers and one full brother, Benjamin.

00:00:52.170 --> 00:01:00.170
At a tender age, Joseph began to face adversity because of the jealousy of his ten older brothers.

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:07.170
Yet Joseph's trials led to the saving of his whole family from famine.

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:14.170
More than that, as a result of his trials, we can receive everlasting blessings.

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:25.310
I invite you to read along in your Bible, as you listen to Genesis 37 verses 2 through 11.

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:35.310
When Joseph was 17 years old, the young man was tending the flock with the sons of Bilha and the sons of Zilpa, the wives of his father.

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.310
And Joseph brought a bad report about them to their father.

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:47.310
Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his other sons because he was the son of his old age.

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.310
And he had a special road made for him.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:59.310
When his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers, they began to hate him and they could not speak peaceably to him.

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:06.310
Later, Joseph had a dream and told it to his brothers and they found further reason to hate him.

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.310
He said to them,

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.310
Please, listen to this dream that I had.

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:22.310
There we were binding sheaves in the middle of the field when my sheave got up and stood erect and your sheaves encircled and bowed down to my sheave.

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.310
His brothers said to him,

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.310
Are you really going to make yourself king over us and dominate us?

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:35.310
So they found another reason to hate him because of his dreams and what he said.

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:41.310
After that, he had still another dream and he related it to his brothers.

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.310
I have had another dream.

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:50.310
This time, the son and the moon and eleven stars were bowing down to me.

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:57.310
Then he related it to his father as well as his brothers and his father rebuked him and said to him,

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.310
What is the meaning of this dream of yours?

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.310
Am I as well as your mother and your brothers?

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.310
Really going to come and bow down to the earth to you?

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:17.259
And his brothers grew jealous of him but his father kept the saying in mind.

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:22.259
Joseph's family find it difficult to accept the meaning of his dreams.

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:25.259
Yet Jacob keeps the saying.

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:28.259
That is, he keeps Joseph's dreams in mind.

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:29.259
How so?

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:32.259
He keeps thinking the matter over.

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:36.259
Perhaps he realizes that his son's dreams are from Jehovah.

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:41.259
Joseph's brothers, however, have a different reaction.

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:46.259
Follow along in Genesis 37, 18 through 36.

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:53.139
Now they go outside of him from a distance and before he reach them,

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:57.139
they begin plotting against him to put him to death.

00:03:57.139 --> 00:03:59.139
So they said to one another.

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:02.139
Look, here comes that dreamer.

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:06.139
Come now, let us kill him and pitch him into one of the water pits.

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:09.139
And we will say that a vicious wild animal devoured him.

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:13.139
Then let us see what will become of his dreams.

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:17.139
When Rubin heard this, he tried to rescue him from them.

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:19.139
So he said,

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:21.139
Let us not take his life.

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:23.139
Rubin said to them,

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:25.139
Do not shed blood.

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:30.139
Throw him into this water pit in the wilderness, but do not harm him.

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:35.139
His purpose was to rescue him from them in order to return him to his father.

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:38.139
So as soon as Joseph came to his brothers,

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:42.139
they stripped Joseph of his robe, the special robe that he wore,

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:46.139
and they took him and threw him into the water pit.

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:50.139
At the time the pit was empty, there was no water in it.

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:53.139
Then they sat down to eat.

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:58.139
When they looked up, there was a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead.

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:02.139
The camels were carrying labdenum gum,

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:04.139
palsum and resinous bark,

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:07.139
and they were on their way down to Egypt.

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:10.139
At this Judas said to his brothers,

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:15.139
What profit would there be if we killed our brother and covered over his blood?

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:18.139
Come now, let us sell him to the Ishmaelites,

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:21.139
and do not let our hand be upon him.

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:25.139
After all, he is our brother, our flesh.

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:28.139
So they listened to their brother,

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:31.139
and when the Midianite merchants were passing by,

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:34.139
they lifted Joseph up out of the water pit

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:39.139
and sold him to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver.

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:42.139
These men took Joseph into Egypt.

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:45.139
Later when Ruben returned to the water pit

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:48.139
and saw that Joseph was not in the water pit,

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:51.139
he ripped his garments apart.

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:54.139
When he returned to his brothers, he exclaimed,

00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:57.139
The child is gone,

00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:00.139
and I, what am I going to do?

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:03.139
So they took Joseph's robe

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:05.139
and slaughtered a male goat

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:07.139
and dipped the robe in the blood.

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:12.139
After that, they sent the special robe to their father and said,

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:15.139
This is what we found.

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:19.139
Please examine whether this is your son's robe or not.

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:22.139
Then he examined it and exclaimed,

00:06:22.139 --> 00:06:25.139
It is my son's robe.

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:29.139
A vicious wild animal must have devoured him.

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:33.139
Joseph is surely torn to pieces.

00:06:33.139 --> 00:06:36.139
With that, Jacob ripped his garments apart

00:06:36.139 --> 00:06:39.139
and put sackcloth around his waist

00:06:39.139 --> 00:06:43.139
and mourned his son for many days.

00:06:43.139 --> 00:06:48.139
And all his sons and all his daughters kept trying to comfort him.

00:06:48.139 --> 00:06:51.139
But he kept refusing to take comfort,

00:06:51.139 --> 00:06:55.139
saying, I will go down into the grave,

00:06:55.139 --> 00:06:57.139
mourning my son.

00:06:57.139 --> 00:07:01.139
And his father continued weeping for him.

00:07:01.139 --> 00:07:05.139
Now the Midianites sold him in Egypt to Porifah,

00:07:05.139 --> 00:07:09.139
a court official of Pharaoh and the chief of the God.

00:07:09.139 --> 00:07:14.259
What a drastic change,

00:07:14.259 --> 00:07:18.259
from favorite son to lowly slave.

00:07:18.259 --> 00:07:22.259
Joseph's brothers not only failed to show loyal love to him,

00:07:22.259 --> 00:07:25.259
they failed to show love to their father, Jacob,

00:07:25.259 --> 00:07:30.259
and most important to their heavenly father, Jehovah.

00:07:30.259 --> 00:07:35.259
Faithful servants of Jehovah are not always shielded from injustice.

00:07:35.259 --> 00:07:40.259
At times, injustice may befall us even at the hands of a fellow believer.

00:07:40.259 --> 00:07:44.259
Are you in the middle of a trial like that?

00:07:44.259 --> 00:07:50.259
Actually, your trial gives you a unique opportunity to prove your love for Jehovah.

00:07:50.259 --> 00:07:52.259
How so?

00:07:52.259 --> 00:07:55.259
Consider how Joseph responded to his trial.

00:07:55.259 --> 00:08:00.259
Note what Genesis 39 verses 1 through 23 says.

00:08:00.259 --> 00:08:05.269
Now Joseph was taken down to Egypt

00:08:05.269 --> 00:08:08.269
and an Egyptian named Porifah,

00:08:08.269 --> 00:08:11.269
a court official of Pharaoh and chief of the God,

00:08:11.269 --> 00:08:14.269
bought him from the Ishmaelites who had taken him down there.

00:08:14.269 --> 00:08:17.269
But Jehovah was with Joseph.

00:08:17.269 --> 00:08:20.269
As a result, he became successful

00:08:20.269 --> 00:08:24.269
and was put over the house of his master, the Egyptian,

00:08:24.269 --> 00:08:27.269
and his master saw that Jehovah was with him

00:08:27.269 --> 00:08:32.269
and that Jehovah was making everything that he did successful.

00:08:32.269 --> 00:08:35.269
Joseph kept finding favor in his eyes

00:08:35.269 --> 00:08:38.269
and he became his personal attendant.

00:08:38.269 --> 00:08:40.269
So he appointed him over his house

00:08:40.269 --> 00:08:43.269
and he put him in charge of all that was his.

00:08:43.269 --> 00:08:46.269
From the time he appointed him over his house

00:08:46.269 --> 00:08:49.269
and in charge of all that was his,

00:08:49.269 --> 00:08:53.269
Jehovah kept blessing the house of the Egyptian because of Joseph.

00:08:53.269 --> 00:08:59.269
And Jehovah's blessing came to be on all that he had in the house and in the field.

00:08:59.269 --> 00:09:04.269
He eventually left everything that was his in Joseph's care

00:09:04.269 --> 00:09:09.269
and he gave no thought to anything except the food he was eating.

00:09:09.269 --> 00:09:14.269
Moreover, Joseph grew to be well built and handsome.

00:09:14.269 --> 00:09:16.269
Now after these things,

00:09:16.269 --> 00:09:22.269
the wife of his master began to cast a rise on Joseph and save.

00:09:22.269 --> 00:09:24.269
Lie down with me.

00:09:24.269 --> 00:09:28.269
But he refused and said to his master's wife,

00:09:28.269 --> 00:09:32.269
Here my master does not know what is with me in the house

00:09:32.269 --> 00:09:35.269
and he has entrusted everything he has into my care.

00:09:35.269 --> 00:09:38.269
There is no one greater in this house than I am

00:09:38.269 --> 00:09:42.269
and he has not withheld from me anything at all except you

00:09:42.269 --> 00:09:44.269
because you are his wife.

00:09:44.269 --> 00:09:50.269
So how could I commit this great badness and actually sin against God?

00:09:50.269 --> 00:09:53.269
So day after day she spoke to Joseph

00:09:53.269 --> 00:09:58.269
but he never consented to lie with her or to remain with her.

00:09:58.269 --> 00:10:02.269
But on one of the days when he went into the house to do his work

00:10:02.269 --> 00:10:06.269
none of the household servants were in the house.

00:10:06.269 --> 00:10:09.269
Then she grabbed hold of him by his garment and said,

00:10:09.269 --> 00:10:11.269
Lie down with me.

00:10:11.269 --> 00:10:15.269
But he left his garment in her hand and fled outside.

00:10:15.269 --> 00:10:19.269
As soon as she saw that he had left his garment in her hand

00:10:19.269 --> 00:10:21.269
and had fled outside,

00:10:21.269 --> 00:10:25.269
she began to cry out to the men of her house and to say to them,

00:10:25.269 --> 00:10:27.269
Look!

00:10:27.269 --> 00:10:32.269
He brought us this Hebrew man to make us a laughing stock.

00:10:32.269 --> 00:10:35.269
He came to me to lie down with me

00:10:35.269 --> 00:10:39.269
but I began to cry out at the top of my voice.

00:10:39.269 --> 00:10:42.269
Then as soon as he heard me raising my voice and screaming

00:10:42.269 --> 00:10:47.269
he left his garment beside me and fled outside.

00:10:47.269 --> 00:10:54.269
After that she laid his garment beside her until his master came to his house.

00:10:54.269 --> 00:10:58.269
Then she told him the same thing, saying,

00:10:58.269 --> 00:11:04.269
The Hebrew servant whom you brought us came to me to make me a laughing stock.

00:11:05.269 --> 00:11:09.269
But as soon as I raised my voice and began to scream

00:11:09.269 --> 00:11:13.269
he left his garment beside me and fled outside.

00:11:13.269 --> 00:11:17.269
As soon as his master heard the words his wife spoke to him,

00:11:17.269 --> 00:11:22.269
These are the things your servant did to me, his anger blazed.

00:11:22.269 --> 00:11:27.269
So Joseph's master took him and gave him over to the prison.

00:11:27.269 --> 00:11:30.269
The place where the prisoners of the king were kept under arrest

00:11:30.269 --> 00:11:33.269
and he remained there in the prison.

00:11:33.269 --> 00:11:38.269
But Jehovah continued with Joseph and kept showing loyal love to him

00:11:38.269 --> 00:11:42.269
and granting him favor in the eyes of the chief officer of the prison.

00:11:42.269 --> 00:11:48.269
So the chief officer of the prison put Joseph in charge of all the prisoners in the prison

00:11:48.269 --> 00:11:53.269
and everything that they were doing there he was the one having it done.

00:11:53.269 --> 00:11:59.269
The chief officer of the prison was looking after absolutely nothing that was in Joseph's care.

00:12:00.269 --> 00:12:08.220
For Jehovah was with Joseph and Jehovah made whatever he did successful.

00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:16.220
Joseph remains under Jehovah's watchful care and Jehovah makes whatever Joseph does successful.

00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:20.220
Why is Jehovah so attached to Joseph?

00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:25.220
Because Joseph maintains unshakable love for God.

00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:31.220
Joseph's experience teaches us that if we maintain our love for Jehovah,

00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:34.220
he will not abandon us.

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:42.220
Rather, he will provide just what we need at the right time so that we may endure.

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:49.220
Returning to Joseph's story, we find he's assigned to care for two special prisoners,

00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:54.220
Pharaoh's personal cupbearer and his chief baker.

00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:59.220
One night they each have a puzzling dream.

00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:06.220
Jehovah enables Joseph to interpret those dreams accurately and the dreams are fulfilled.

00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:14.220
Notice that at Genesis 40, verse 14, Joseph entreats the cupbearer with the words,

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:18.220
just remember me when things go well with you.

00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:25.220
Please show me loyal love and mention me to Pharaoh in order to get me out of this place.

00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:30.220
But the cupbearer forgets all about Joseph.

00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:39.220
Eventually Pharaoh himself has two baffling dreams, one of plump cattle eaten by skinny ones,

00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:45.220
and the other of choice ears of grain swallowed by shriveled ones.

00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:51.220
None of the priests and wise men in Egypt were able to interpret these dreams.

00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:58.220
Finally, the cupbearer tells Pharaoh about Joseph's amazing ability to interpret dreams.

00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:02.220
Joseph is quickly summoned from prison.

00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:07.220
As we resume our reading from Genesis 41, verse 25,

00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:12.220
Joseph, now 30 years old, is standing before the king.

00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:17.399
Then Joseph said to Pharaoh,

00:14:17.399 --> 00:14:20.399
The dreams of Pharaoh are one and the same.

00:14:20.399 --> 00:14:24.399
The true God has told to Pharaoh what he will do.

00:14:24.399 --> 00:14:28.399
The seven good cows are seven years.

00:14:28.399 --> 00:14:32.399
Likewise, the seven good ears of grain are seven years.

00:14:32.399 --> 00:14:35.399
The dreams are one and the same.

00:14:35.399 --> 00:14:39.399
The seven skinny and bad cows that came up after them are seven years.

00:14:39.399 --> 00:14:47.399
And the seven empty ears of grain scorched by the east wind will prove to be seven years of famine.

00:14:47.399 --> 00:14:49.399
This is just as I told to Pharaoh.

00:14:49.399 --> 00:14:53.399
The true God has caused Pharaoh to see what he will do.

00:14:53.399 --> 00:14:58.399
There are to be seven years of great abundance in all the land of Egypt.

00:14:58.399 --> 00:15:02.399
But seven years of famine will certainly arise after them.

00:15:02.399 --> 00:15:06.399
And all the abundance in the land of Egypt will certainly be forgotten.

00:15:06.399 --> 00:15:09.399
And the famine will exhaust the land.

00:15:09.399 --> 00:15:14.399
And the previous abundance in the land will not be remembered because of the famine afterward.

00:15:14.399 --> 00:15:17.399
For it will be very severe.

00:15:17.399 --> 00:15:24.399
The dream was given twice to Pharaoh because the matter has been firmly established by the true God.

00:15:24.399 --> 00:15:27.399
And the true God will soon carry it out.

00:15:28.399 --> 00:15:33.399
Joseph lays out a detailed strategy to deal with the coming famine.

00:15:33.399 --> 00:15:40.399
Pharaoh is so pleased with Joseph's interpretation and his sound advice

00:15:40.399 --> 00:15:47.399
that he installs Joseph as ruler over all Egypt second only to himself.

00:15:47.399 --> 00:15:52.399
Eight years later, famine dominates the region.

00:15:52.399 --> 00:15:55.399
Joseph's family suffers too.

00:15:55.399 --> 00:16:00.399
Jacob directs his sons to try to buy food in Egypt.

00:16:00.399 --> 00:16:04.399
Jacob's ten oldest sons leave for Egypt.

00:16:04.399 --> 00:16:09.399
However, his youngest Benjamin stays safely at home.

00:16:09.399 --> 00:16:18.399
The ten brothers meet Joseph and bow down to him, fulfilling Joseph's dream from years earlier.

00:16:18.399 --> 00:16:23.399
Joseph recognizes his brothers, but they don't recognize him.

00:16:23.399 --> 00:16:32.399
He speaks to them only in Egyptian through an interpreter and keeps his true identity secret.

00:16:32.399 --> 00:16:35.399
Joseph now has a decision to make.

00:16:35.399 --> 00:16:40.399
Will he use his authority to make life hard for his brothers?

00:16:40.399 --> 00:16:46.399
Will he dismiss them indifferently, feeling that they don't deserve his help?

00:16:46.399 --> 00:16:50.399
Or will he look for any opening to reconcile with them?

00:16:51.399 --> 00:16:55.399
Will he imitate Jehovah's loyal love?

00:16:55.399 --> 00:16:58.399
What would you have done?

00:16:58.399 --> 00:17:05.400
Joseph wants to know if their attitude has changed or if they're still filled with hatred and envy.

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:17.400
Thus, he accuses them of being spies, telling them he'll keep their brothers' simmian under arrest until they return with Benjamin.

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:24.900
Let's read Genesis 42 verses 21 through 24.

00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:33.900
We are surely being punished on account of our brother, because we saw his distress when he begged us to show compassion, but we did not listen.

00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:37.900
That is why this distress has come upon us.

00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:39.900
Then Ruben answered them.

00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:46.900
Did I not say to you, do not sin against the child, but you would not listen.

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:51.900
Now his blood is certainly being asked back.

00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:56.900
But they did not know that Joseph understood, for there was an interpreter between them.

00:17:56.900 --> 00:18:00.900
So he turned away from them and began to weep.

00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:08.900
When he returned and spoke to them again, he took simmian from them and bound him before their eyes.

00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:13.900
Ruben expresses remorse over their mistreatment of Joseph.

00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:18.900
But are Ruben and his brothers genuinely repentant?

00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:28.900
To find out, Joseph demands that his brothers return to Canaan and then bring Benjamin, their youngest brother, to Egypt.

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:34.900
How does Jacob respond to the demand that Benjamin be brought to Egypt?

00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:40.900
Genesis 42 verses 36 and 37 answers.

00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:48.900
It is I you have bereaved. Joseph is no more and simmian is no more and you are going to take Benjamin.

00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:52.900
It is upon me that all these things have come.

00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:55.900
But Ruben said to his father,

00:18:55.900 --> 00:19:00.900
You may put to death my own two sons if I do not bring him back to you.

00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:05.900
Give him over to my care and I will return him to you.

00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:12.900
Jacob is adamant. He will not allow Benjamin out of his sight.

00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:20.900
However, by the second year of the famine, the food supplies run out at home for Jacob and his household.

00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:29.900
Will Jacob now be persuaded to let Benjamin join his brothers in their trek back to Egypt for more food supplies?

00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:37.900
Let's find out by reading Genesis 43 verses 8 through 10, 13 and 14.

00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:40.900
Judah then urged Israel his father.

00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:45.900
Send the boy with me and let us go on our way so that we may live and not die.

00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:48.900
We and you and our children.

00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:50.900
I will be a guarantee for his safety.

00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:53.900
You may hold me responsible.

00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:58.900
If I fail to return him to you and present him to you, I will have sinned against you for all time.

00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:03.900
But if we had not delayed, we could have been there and back twice by now.

00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:09.569
Take your brother and go. Return to the man.

00:20:09.569 --> 00:20:18.569
May God Almighty grant you pity from the man so that he may release to you your other brother in Benjamin.

00:20:18.569 --> 00:20:24.569
But as for me, if I must be bereaved, I will be bereaved.

00:20:24.569 --> 00:20:33.259
Although earlier, Judah had displayed insensitivity toward his father's favorite son, Joseph.

00:20:33.259 --> 00:20:40.259
Now he is willing to take full responsibility for his father's beloved son, Benjamin.

00:20:40.259 --> 00:20:46.259
So Jacob permits his sons to return to Egypt, bringing Joseph a large gift.

00:20:46.259 --> 00:20:53.259
Let's continue reading Genesis 43 verses 26 through 30.

00:20:54.259 --> 00:21:02.259
When Joseph went into the house, they brought their gift to him into the house and prostrated themselves to him to the ground.

00:21:02.259 --> 00:21:05.259
How is your aged father of whom you have spoken?

00:21:05.259 --> 00:21:07.259
Is he still alive?

00:21:07.259 --> 00:21:09.259
To this they said,

00:21:09.259 --> 00:21:14.259
You are servant. Our father is well. He is still alive.

00:21:14.259 --> 00:21:19.259
Then they bowed down and prostrated themselves.

00:21:19.259 --> 00:21:25.259
When he looked up and saw Benjamin his brother, the son of his mother, he said,

00:21:25.259 --> 00:21:30.259
Is this your brother, the youngest one of whom you have spoken to me?

00:21:30.259 --> 00:21:32.259
He added,

00:21:32.259 --> 00:21:35.259
May God show you his favor.

00:21:35.259 --> 00:21:43.259
Joseph then hurried out because he was overcome with emotion for his brother and he looked for a place to weep.

00:21:43.259 --> 00:21:48.259
So he went into a private room and gave way to tears there.

00:21:49.259 --> 00:21:54.259
Joseph wants to discern his brother's true feelings so he tests them.

00:21:54.259 --> 00:21:56.259
How?

00:21:56.259 --> 00:22:00.259
Joseph has his servants fill each of his brother's bags with food.

00:22:00.259 --> 00:22:06.259
Secretly, he also has his special silver cup slipped into Benjamin's bag.

00:22:06.259 --> 00:22:11.259
After they all leave and have traveled a short distance on the road,

00:22:11.259 --> 00:22:14.259
Joseph sends his servants after them.

00:22:15.259 --> 00:22:19.259
When they catch up with them, the servants demand,

00:22:19.259 --> 00:22:23.259
Why have you stolen our master's silver cup?

00:22:23.259 --> 00:22:28.259
Joseph's brother strongly deny any wrongdoing and add,

00:22:28.259 --> 00:22:34.259
If you find the cup with any one of us, let that person be killed.

00:22:34.259 --> 00:22:40.259
So the servants search through all the bags and they find the cup in Benjamin's bag.

00:22:40.259 --> 00:22:45.259
The brothers show their grief by ripping their garments apart.

00:22:45.259 --> 00:22:51.259
Perplexed, they all return with Benjamin to Joseph's house.

00:22:51.259 --> 00:22:57.259
Now, having fallen to the ground before Joseph, Judah says,

00:22:57.259 --> 00:23:01.259
The true God has found out the error of your slaves.

00:23:01.259 --> 00:23:05.259
We are now slaves to my master.

00:23:05.259 --> 00:23:09.259
Joseph, continuing his test, replies sternly,

00:23:09.259 --> 00:23:12.259
As for the rest of you, return home.

00:23:12.259 --> 00:23:16.259
But Benjamin must stay here as my slave.

00:23:16.259 --> 00:23:18.259
Judah moans.

00:23:18.259 --> 00:23:24.259
If I fail to bring Benjamin back, my father will surely die.

00:23:24.259 --> 00:23:28.259
And I will have sinned against him forever.

00:23:28.259 --> 00:23:34.259
Judah is unwilling to cause his father the pain of losing another favored son.

00:23:34.259 --> 00:23:39.259
So he volunteers to become a slave in place of Benjamin.

00:23:39.259 --> 00:23:47.259
Let's read of Joseph's emotional reaction at Genesis 45 verses 1 through 15.

00:23:47.259 --> 00:23:53.829
At this, Joseph could no longer control himself before all his attendants.

00:23:53.829 --> 00:23:57.829
So he cried out, have everyone leave me?

00:23:57.829 --> 00:24:02.829
No one else stayed with him while Joseph made himself known to his brothers.

00:24:02.829 --> 00:24:09.829
Then he began to weep so loudly that the Egyptians heard it and Pharaoh's house heard it.

00:24:09.829 --> 00:24:12.829
Finally, Joseph said to his brothers,

00:24:12.829 --> 00:24:17.829
I am Joseph. Is my father still alive?

00:24:17.829 --> 00:24:24.829
But his brothers were unable to answer him at all because they were astonished on account of him.

00:24:24.829 --> 00:24:27.829
So Joseph said to his brothers,

00:24:27.829 --> 00:24:30.829
Come close to me, please.

00:24:30.829 --> 00:24:33.829
With that, they came close to him.

00:24:33.829 --> 00:24:35.829
Then he said,

00:24:35.829 --> 00:24:41.829
I am Joseph, your brother whom you sold into Egypt.

00:24:41.829 --> 00:24:48.829
But now, do not be upset and do not reproach one another because you sold me here.

00:24:48.829 --> 00:24:54.829
Because God has sent me ahead of you for the preservation of life.

00:24:54.829 --> 00:24:57.829
This is the second year of the famine in the land.

00:24:57.829 --> 00:25:02.829
And there are yet five years in which there will be no plowing or harvest.

00:25:02.829 --> 00:25:12.829
But God sent me ahead of you in order to preserve for you a remnant on the earth and to keep you alive by a great deliverance.

00:25:12.829 --> 00:25:19.829
So then, it was not you who sent me here, but it was the true God.

00:25:19.829 --> 00:25:28.829
In order to appoint me as chief advisor to Pharaoh and Lord for all his house and ruler over all the land of Egypt,

00:25:28.829 --> 00:25:31.829
return quickly to my father.

00:25:31.829 --> 00:25:33.829
And you must say to him,

00:25:33.829 --> 00:25:36.829
this is what your son Joseph has said.

00:25:36.829 --> 00:25:40.829
God has appointed me, Lord, over all Egypt.

00:25:40.829 --> 00:25:43.829
Come down to me. Do not delay.

00:25:43.829 --> 00:25:47.829
You must dwell in the land of Goshen where you will be near me.

00:25:47.829 --> 00:25:53.829
You, your sons, your grandsons, your flocks, your herds and everything you have.

00:25:53.829 --> 00:25:56.829
I will supply you with food there.

00:25:56.829 --> 00:25:59.829
For there are yet five years of famine.

00:25:59.829 --> 00:26:04.829
Otherwise, you and your house and everything you have will come to poverty.

00:26:04.829 --> 00:26:12.829
You and my brother Benjamin can now see with your own eyes that I am really the one speaking to you.

00:26:12.829 --> 00:26:18.829
So you must tell my father about all my glory in Egypt and everything you have seen.

00:26:18.829 --> 00:26:22.829
Now hurry and bring my father down here.

00:26:22.829 --> 00:26:30.829
Then he embraced his brother Benjamin and gave way to weeping and Benjamin wept with his arms around his neck.

00:26:30.829 --> 00:26:35.829
And he kissed all his brothers and wept over them.

00:26:35.829 --> 00:26:41.829
Accordingly, Jacob, with about 70 of his family, moves down to Egypt.

00:26:41.829 --> 00:26:45.829
Pharaoh gives them the land of Goshen to dwell in.

00:26:45.829 --> 00:26:56.829
For 215 years, Jacob's descendants live in Egypt until the day when all three million or more of them pass between the walls of the parted Red Sea

00:26:56.829 --> 00:27:00.829
and eventually take possession of the promised land.

00:27:00.829 --> 00:27:06.829
Jehovah used Joseph to preserve the line of descent leading to the Messiah.

00:27:06.829 --> 00:27:10.829
What can the story of Joseph teach us?

00:27:10.829 --> 00:27:17.829
No matter what situation he faced, Joseph showed loyal love to Jehovah.

00:27:17.829 --> 00:27:23.829
For years he was battered by one trial after another, but he never became resentful.

00:27:23.829 --> 00:27:29.829
Today we may have little control over the trials we face in this imperfect system.

00:27:30.829 --> 00:27:34.829
But we can control our reaction to them.

00:27:34.829 --> 00:27:38.829
We refuse to become embittered against Jehovah.

00:27:38.829 --> 00:27:47.829
We love Jehovah and we are determined to prove our love by rejecting any conduct that would hurt him.

00:27:47.829 --> 00:27:57.829
Later, when Joseph's circumstances changed, he showed loyal love to his family despite his brother's unjust treatment.

00:27:57.829 --> 00:28:03.829
In fact, Joseph's loyal love toward his family helped to fulfill a prophecy.

00:28:03.829 --> 00:28:15.829
In the days of Joseph's great-grandfather Abraham, Jehovah had set the precise time to deliver his people exactly 430 years later.

00:28:15.829 --> 00:28:22.829
If Joseph had not shown loyal love toward his family, how would that prophecy have been fulfilled?

00:28:22.829 --> 00:28:28.829
Obviously, our loyal love for our brothers matters to Jehovah.

00:28:28.829 --> 00:28:38.829
So if you are ever hurt by your spiritual brother, reject the temptation to spread negative talk about him or to hurt him in kind,

00:28:38.829 --> 00:28:42.829
do whatever is necessary to restore peace.

00:28:42.829 --> 00:28:50.829
After all, our brothers are loved by Jehovah. They deserve our loyal love too.

00:28:50.829 --> 00:28:55.829
The finest example of loyal love in this account is Jehovah.

00:28:55.829 --> 00:29:03.829
Joseph was abandoned by his family, slandered by his employer's wife, and finally thrown into prison.

00:29:03.829 --> 00:29:10.829
But Jehovah continued with Joseph and kept showing loyal love to him. Why?

00:29:10.829 --> 00:29:17.829
He saw that Joseph remained loyal. So he acted in loyalty toward Joseph.

00:29:17.829 --> 00:29:24.829
Jehovah's treatment of Joseph was also an expression of loyal love toward the nation of Israel.

00:29:24.829 --> 00:29:37.829
By using Joseph to preserve his family, Jehovah preserved the line of the Messiah and ensured that his promise to deliver the Israelites was fulfilled right on time.

00:29:37.829 --> 00:29:42.829
Isn't that reassuring? Imperfect humans may let you down.

00:29:43.829 --> 00:29:49.829
You may face ridicule or even slander, or you may be treated unjustly.

00:29:49.829 --> 00:30:00.829
But if you remain loyal, Jehovah will never abandon you. He never forgot Joseph, and he will not forget any of his loyal servants today.

00:30:00.829 --> 00:30:07.829
Stick close to Jehovah, and he will continue showing loyal love to you.
