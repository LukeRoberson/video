00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:06.540
and introduction to 2nd Samuel.

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.539
In the original Hebrew canon,

00:00:08.539 --> 00:00:12.539
1st and 2nd Samuel were 1 volume.

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:15.539
The prophets Gad and Nathan,

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:17.539
who completed the writing of 1st Samuel,

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:20.539
wrote all of 2nd Samuel.

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:24.539
The narrative covers a period of some 37 years

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.539
from 1077 to about 1040 BCE

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:31.539
when the writing was completed.

00:00:32.539 --> 00:00:36.539
2nd Samuel begins shortly after the death of King Saul

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:40.539
and concludes just before the death of King David.

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:45.539
The book is an intimate and honest account of David's life

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:51.810
as he sought to follow Jehovah with all his heart.

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:55.810
In chapter 1, David receives tragic news.

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:00.810
Saul and his son Jonathan have died in battle.

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:06.810
Deeply grieved, David composes a dirge and calls it the bow.

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.810
The rest of 2nd Samuel can be divided into 2 sections.

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.810
Chapters 2 to 4 cover David's kingship over Judah.

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:22.810
Chapters 5 to 24 cover his rule over all Israel.

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.810
In chapter 2, David goes to Hebron

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.810
where he has made King over the tribe of Judah.

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.810
Meanwhile, Saul's army chief Abner

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.810
makes Saul's son Ishbosheth King over the other tribes.

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.810
In chapters 3 and 4, however,

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.810
Abner and Ishbosheth are put to death.

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.810
And in the following chapter,

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.599
the people make David King over all Israel.

00:01:51.599 --> 00:01:55.599
David then captures the Jebiusite stronghold of Zion

00:01:55.599 --> 00:01:58.599
and moves his capital there from Hebron.

00:01:58.599 --> 00:02:02.599
Zion becomes known also as the city of David.

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:08.599
In chapter 6, David has the Ark of the Covenant brought to Jerusalem.

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:13.599
In chapter 7, David tells Nathan that he would like to build a house

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:15.599
or temple for Jehovah,

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:20.599
but God gives this privilege to a future son of the King.

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:23.599
However, out of love for David,

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:28.599
Jehovah makes a covenant with him for an everlasting kingdom.

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:34.599
Chapters 8 and 10 tell about David's victories over the Amalakites,

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:39.599
Moabites, Belistings, and other enemies.

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:44.599
Chapter 11 brings us to one of the darkest periods in David's life.

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:47.599
He commits adultery with Bathsheba.

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:49.599
She becomes pregnant,

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:53.599
David has her husband Uriah killed in battle.

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:57.599
In chapter 12, Nathan, at Jehovah's direction,

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:59.599
approves David.

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:03.599
He also says that calamity will befall David's house

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:08.599
and that Bathsheba's newborn son will die.

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:11.599
Bathsheba, who is now David's wife,

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:16.599
becomes pregnant again and gives birth to Solomon.

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:23.599
In chapters 13 to 18, the foretold calamities on David's house begin.

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:27.599
David's son, Absalom, conspires to usurp the throne

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:31.599
and David is forced to flee Jerusalem.

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:36.599
In chapter 18, David's men defeat Absolams

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:39.599
and Joab puts Absolam to death.

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:47.939
Did you know Second Samuel powerfully illustrates the Bible's honesty.

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:53.939
Even the failings of Israel's great leaders are openly exposed.

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:57.939
We also see that truly repentant sinners

00:03:57.939 --> 00:04:05.520
while reaping what they have sown can be forgiven.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:09.520
In chapter 23, David humbly acknowledges,

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.520
the spirit of Jehovah spoke through me.

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:15.520
His word was on my tongue.

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:20.519
In chapter 24, David is incited to register the nation.

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:24.519
This bad act angers Jehovah,

00:04:24.519 --> 00:04:27.519
who brings a scourge on the people.

00:04:27.519 --> 00:04:29.519
At the Prophet Gad's direction,

00:04:29.519 --> 00:04:33.519
David buys the threshing floor of Arana the Jebusite,

00:04:33.519 --> 00:04:35.519
builds an altar there,

00:04:35.519 --> 00:04:39.519
and offers up sacrifices to God.

00:04:39.519 --> 00:04:45.800
At Jehovah's command, the scourge against Israel is halted.

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.800
As you read Second Samuel,

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:52.800
see how honestly God's prophets recorded Israel's history.

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.800
Observe how sin can have tragic consequences.

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.800
And note God's promise to give David a lasting kingdom.

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.800
A promise fulfilled in Jesus Christ,

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.800
the Son of David, and King of God's kingdom.
