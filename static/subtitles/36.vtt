WEBVTT

00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:09.250
Welcome, brothers and sisters. As Jesus' followers, we're happy to be related in the faith.

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:16.210
This month's program is full of faithful examples and ways you and I can act in faith to make

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:22.690
things happen. We'll visit with the Lachmouth sisters at the Canada branch. How did their

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:28.530
faith help them adjust to leaving their home in Canada to serve in a missionary assignment

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:36.170
in India? For decades, the apartheid laws in South Africa separated our brothers from

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:43.810
one another. How were their neutrality, brotherly love and faith in Jehovah put to the test?

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:48.649
And our music video depicts how a person's faith grows from when they first studied the

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:57.530
Bible to when they faced trials as a dedicated witness of Jehovah. This is the April 2017

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:24.489
edition of J.W. Broadcasting. Has fear of failure ever held you back from doing something good,

00:01:24.489 --> 00:01:32.409
even something for Jehovah? Some have hesitated to dedicate themselves to God and get baptized

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:39.209
for fear of breaking God's laws. In other cases, we might not reach out for a form of service

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:48.250
because we don't feel we can do a good job. In this dramatization, a Bible student faces his fear of

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:55.370
failure. It's based on lessons found in chapter 1 of the book Keep Yourselves and God's Love.

00:01:56.489 --> 00:02:00.730
Look for what helps him overcome his fear and move ahead in faith.

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:21.159
Our family was contacted by Jehovah's Witnesses a few years ago. Rachel started

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:29.080
studying first. Soon, we all joined in. For the first time, we were all learning what the Bible

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.439
really teaches. It wasn't long before we were sharing the truth with others.

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:44.439
Well, most of us were. I knew it was the truth, but I didn't know if I could live up to everything

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:59.319
Jehovah asks, what if I let everyone down? What if I let Jehovah down?

00:03:19.719 --> 00:03:26.699
A kind elder named Ben noticed I was struggling. He took the initiative to help.

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.340
He asked, what drew you to Jehovah in the first place?

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.939
I guess it was learning that Jehovah isn't harsh and demanding,

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:45.389
but he's a loving father. Ben agreed and said, when we do our best to serve Jehovah,

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:52.590
he does the rest. He explained that Jehovah knows our limitations and doesn't expect perfection

00:03:52.590 --> 00:04:00.270
and he's always there to help because he wants us to succeed. Then he read Isaiah 4110,

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:15.439
Do not be afraid for I am with you. Do not be anxious for I am your God. I will fortify you.

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:22.800
Yes, I will help you. I will really hold on to you with my right hand of righteousness.

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:35.240
I don't need to be perfect to serve Jehovah. I just need to love him and trust him

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:50.779
and heal, do the rest. Our brother learned what the love of God means. As 1 John 5 3 tells us,

00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:55.819
it means that we observe his commandments and yet his commandments are not burdensome.

00:04:56.779 --> 00:05:02.379
Jehovah is a loving father who wants us to succeed. As our brother concluded,

00:05:03.019 --> 00:05:06.540
we need to trust Jehovah knowing he'll do the rest.

00:05:07.339 --> 00:05:12.459
That lesson provides an excellent introduction to our discussion for this month.

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:20.620
The theme is, faith in Jehovah makes it happen. During his earthly ministry,

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:27.420
Jesus miraculously healed many sick or disabled persons. At times, he would say to such ones,

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:35.100
the expression we find at Matthew 929, according to your faith, let it happen to you.

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:42.699
The principle of what Jesus stated applies in every aspect of our Christian life and ministry.

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:49.980
But today, we would discuss how this principle that faith in Jehovah makes things happen

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:57.100
can work for us in three areas. We will see, number one, how our faith has made positive things happen

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:04.540
in our personal life. Two, how we can accomplish things in God's service that would not be possible

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:12.779
without faith in Jehovah God. And three, how faith moves us to step out of our comfort zone

00:06:12.779 --> 00:06:19.339
to do more in Jehovah's service. The principle faith in Jehovah makes things happen

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:27.579
is well illustrated in one of the miracles Jesus performed. Please open your Bible to Mark chapter

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:37.500
5 and let's read verses 25 through 29. Now there was a woman who had had a flow of blood for 12 years.

00:06:38.379 --> 00:06:43.740
She had suffered much at the hands of many physicians and had spent all her resources,

00:06:44.379 --> 00:06:51.339
and she was no better, but rather had become worse. When she heard the reports about Jesus,

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:56.300
she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his outer garment.

00:06:57.259 --> 00:07:03.740
For she kept saying, if I touch just his outer garments, I will get well.

00:07:04.779 --> 00:07:11.579
And immediately her flow of blood dried up and she sensed in her body that she had been healed

00:07:11.579 --> 00:07:17.899
of the grievous sickness. In the following verses, Jesus asked who had touched him,

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:23.579
the woman then reveals before the crowd what she had done and how she'd been cured.

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:30.699
Now notice Jesus' response in verse 34. He said to her,

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:38.779
daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace and be healed from your grievous sickness.

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:46.379
What comforting words Jesus spoke to this trembling woman, your faith has made you well.

00:07:47.259 --> 00:07:51.100
What did Jesus mean? Let's examine the account more closely.

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:59.019
It says that the woman heard reports about Jesus. Many others heard the same reports,

00:07:59.019 --> 00:08:05.259
but not all put faith in Jesus and think of the circumstances that could have prevented her

00:08:05.259 --> 00:08:11.579
from even coming to Jesus. She had been disappointed many times over the past 12 years.

00:08:12.459 --> 00:08:20.699
She might well have thought, what's the use? I'm tired and weak and poor. I am staying home.

00:08:21.339 --> 00:08:27.819
Or I would like for Jesus to see me, but there is such a crowd. How will I ever get through to him?

00:08:28.699 --> 00:08:35.580
And after all, I'm in an unclean state. And if the people discover this, perhaps they will punish me.

00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:41.340
No, she did not allow these negative thoughts or doubts to fill her mind.

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:49.340
She left her home. She found Jesus despite the large crowd. And what was she saying?

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:59.500
Did she say, if I touch just his outer garments, maybe I will get well? No, she said, I will get well.

00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:08.779
Now, it was not the case that her faith healed her. No, but her faith moved her to come to Jesus,

00:09:08.779 --> 00:09:13.500
and she was healed by the power from Jehovah that flowed through his Son.

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:22.720
Faith to approach Jesus made it happen for her. If you are a dedicated baptized Christian,

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:28.799
don't you agree that your faith has already made positive things happen in your personal life?

00:09:29.759 --> 00:09:35.919
No, you were not miraculously healed of your physical sicknesses. We look forward to physical

00:09:35.919 --> 00:09:43.759
healing of our eels during the thousand-year reign of Christ. But today, Jesus Christ directs a program

00:09:43.759 --> 00:09:51.200
of spiritual healing. When we were a part of this godless world, many of us were sick, spiritually,

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:57.600
morally and emotionally. No one could cure us. Perhaps we desperately tried

00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:04.080
material things or pleasures to feel our spiritual need, but our condition only got worse.

00:10:05.759 --> 00:10:13.679
We were helpless and hopeless, but then we heard reports, the good news of God's kingdom under

00:10:13.679 --> 00:10:20.399
Christ. We studied the Bible. Our faith moved us to make positive changes in our life,

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:28.159
and to associate with the Christian congregation. Today, we enjoy good spiritual health and happiness.

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:37.419
Our faith has made it happen. Faith has also made it possible to accomplish things in God's

00:10:37.419 --> 00:10:45.580
service that perhaps we never thought we could do. Please open your Bibles to Hebrews chapter 11.

00:10:46.139 --> 00:10:53.100
In this portion of Paul's letter to the Hebrews, he focuses on faith. It begins with the

00:10:53.100 --> 00:11:02.059
definition of faith, but then starting in verse 4, Paul acts as a sort of tour guide, walking us

00:11:02.059 --> 00:11:08.779
through the corridor of thousands of years of Bible history. He stops along the way to point out

00:11:08.779 --> 00:11:15.259
the extraordinary things that men and women of the past did by means of faith in Jehovah God.

00:11:17.019 --> 00:11:25.019
Just glance down the columns in this chapter and notice how Paul introduces each paragraph with

00:11:25.019 --> 00:11:35.259
the words, by faith. This expression by faith appears 18 times in this one chapter.

00:11:36.139 --> 00:11:44.299
Now, when we look at the names Paul lists in this chapter, we may think, well, these were

00:11:44.299 --> 00:11:52.539
spiritual giants, but in reality, they were ordinary humans with weaknesses like all of us have today.

00:11:53.659 --> 00:12:01.980
The thing they all had in common was faith, and faith in Jehovah made it possible for them to do

00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:09.019
amazing things. Let's look at some of them and compare what they did with what many of you are

00:12:09.019 --> 00:12:20.220
doing today by faith. Let's read verse 5. By faith, Enoch was transferred, so as not to see death,

00:12:21.019 --> 00:12:27.899
and he was nowhere to be found because God had transferred him. For before he was transferred,

00:12:27.899 --> 00:12:35.259
he received the witness that he had pleased God well. The book of Jude, verses 14 and 15,

00:12:36.139 --> 00:12:42.379
informs us that Enoch boldly proclaimed that Jehovah was going to destroy that ungodly world.

00:12:43.659 --> 00:12:49.659
It appears that wicked, violent men were going to take Enoch's life because of his bold witness.

00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:59.100
So God chose to take him, that is, gently cutting short his life, sparing him the pangs of a violent death.

00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:07.389
In modern times, like Enoch, many brothers and sisters have boldly declared God's judgment,

00:13:07.950 --> 00:13:15.549
even when faced with death. One brother, after receiving a death sentence at Nazi hands during World War II,

00:13:16.190 --> 00:13:19.389
wrote these words shortly before his execution.

00:13:20.909 --> 00:13:27.389
I have such peace, such tranquility, that you can't possibly imagine.

00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:36.669
Faith made such boldness and calmness possible. In many ways, you very likely have shown the same

00:13:36.669 --> 00:13:45.600
faith as Enoch. By faith, you stand up to an ungodly world by not adopting its corrupt ways.

00:13:46.559 --> 00:13:52.159
By faith, you boldly declare God's word from house to house and in public places.

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:58.799
Before you became a baptized witness, you have may have thought you would never do this preaching

00:13:58.799 --> 00:14:05.039
work, but you are doing it, sometimes even in the face of verbal abuse and opposition.

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:10.799
Faith has made it happen. Let's read verse 7.

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:16.960
By faith, Noah, after receiving divine warning of things not yet seen,

00:14:17.919 --> 00:14:22.720
showed godly fear and constructed an ark for the saving of his household.

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:29.120
And through this faith, he condemned the world, and he became an heir of the righteousness

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:36.240
that results from faith. Nothing in the Bible indicates that Jehovah chose Noah to construct an

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:44.000
ark because he was an experienced builder. Certainly, he never had built such a gigantic vessel

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:51.440
as what Jehovah'd asked him to construct. Noah likely pondered many questions. How will I get

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:58.320
all the building materials? Do I have the right tools to do the job? How will I gather all the

00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:05.679
animals? What food will they need and how much? When exactly will the deluge begin?

00:15:06.399 --> 00:15:11.360
How long will it last? Where will the ark land after the flood subsides?

00:15:12.799 --> 00:15:17.360
Nothing in the record indicates that Jehovah gave Noah all the details in advance.

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:27.120
What Noah did have was faith. Faith moved him to begin building. His faith saved him and his family.

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:34.559
Faith in Jehovah made it happen. Like Noah, during this time of the end,

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:40.159
Jehovah's people have taken on challenging theocratic building projects.

00:15:41.279 --> 00:15:46.639
Certainly, constructing the new world headquarters at Warwick, New York was one of these projects

00:15:46.639 --> 00:15:52.879
that required much faith. A committee of brothers was assigned to complete this vast project

00:15:53.519 --> 00:16:00.559
in less than four years. To do so, they knew they had to begin by July 2013.

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:07.919
They moved ahead in faith. Though the town had not yet approved the site permits,

00:16:07.919 --> 00:16:11.600
they began inviting workers to the site with that date in mind.

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:20.159
Time was passing quickly. The invited volunteers were buying plane tickets. Bethel was arranging

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:25.840
rooming in other details. Yet the committee still did not have site permits.

00:16:26.799 --> 00:16:30.000
Would they cancel these invitations? They state,

00:16:31.759 --> 00:16:37.039
we spent a lot of time praying about it. We decided we needed to act in faith

00:16:38.159 --> 00:16:42.399
and we were just convinced Jehovah was going to make it happen.

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:49.519
As the deadline approached, the brothers had done everything possible to obtain the permits.

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:53.600
The town planning board was holding a public hearing.

00:16:54.720 --> 00:17:00.080
And so the brothers' great surprise, within 15 minutes of the start of the meeting,

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:06.160
the town board voted to approve the project. These oversteers commented,

00:17:07.759 --> 00:17:13.839
when the approval came through, we knew it was only by Jehovah's spirit that that happened.

00:17:14.799 --> 00:17:20.079
True, but it was also the brothers' faith to act that made it happen.

00:17:21.279 --> 00:17:27.359
Those experiences are found in the video, world headquarters, history is being written.

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:33.279
You can find it in the R activity section under the construction category.

00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:38.059
Now let's read Hebrews 118.

00:17:39.019 --> 00:17:47.099
By faith, Abraham, when he was called, obeyed by going out to a place he was to receive as an

00:17:47.099 --> 00:17:55.660
inheritance. He went out, although not knowing where he was going. What faith it took for Abraham

00:17:55.660 --> 00:18:02.619
and his submissive wife, Sarah, to leave the prosperous city of her and go wherever Jehovah would

00:18:02.619 --> 00:18:09.420
lead them. It meant leaving the security of a pleasant home and moving to some strange and

00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:16.059
potentially hostile land, some 1,000 miles or 1,609 kilometers away.

00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:26.220
Do we see such faith today? Absolutely. Since 2014, thousands of brothers and sisters have

00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:32.140
attended the school for Kingdom Evangelizers, agreeing to be assigned to wherever there is a

00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:41.259
need by the organization. Faith has made it happen. When a call goes out for skilled volunteers

00:18:41.259 --> 00:18:48.220
to help build or expand branch facilities, faith moves brothers and sisters to simplify their

00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:57.500
lives and to leave their comfort zone in order to assist. For example, in 2009, the congregations

00:18:57.579 --> 00:19:04.380
in the United States were informed that an expansion project at Wal-Kill New York was being planned.

00:19:05.579 --> 00:19:13.099
One couple moved out of their newly built 2,200 square foot or 200 square meter dream home

00:19:13.819 --> 00:19:21.019
and into a 270 square foot or 25 square meter apartment so that they could make themselves

00:19:21.339 --> 00:19:28.220
available. What happened? They explained, one month after we moved into our small apartment,

00:19:28.859 --> 00:19:36.539
we received an invitation to serve as temporary volunteers at Wal-Kill. It was clear to us that by

00:19:36.539 --> 00:19:44.779
simplifying our life, we had given Jehovah something to bless. Faith made it happen for them.

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:54.380
So, what have we learned today? Faith in Jehovah God is a powerful, motivating force that

00:19:54.380 --> 00:20:02.779
impels us to act in harmony with His will. Jehovah rewards such faith. Remember, the very meaning

00:20:02.779 --> 00:20:11.579
of the name of our God, Jehovah, is He causes to become. Truly, He is a God who makes things happen.

00:20:12.539 --> 00:20:19.500
Brothers and sisters, let us continue to act in faith. Jehovah will continue to make wonderful

00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:26.059
things happen in our personal life. We will accomplish things we never could do through our own

00:20:26.059 --> 00:20:31.900
personal efforts. We were able to do more in Jehovah's service. May it happen to you

00:20:32.619 --> 00:20:39.920
according to your faith. We met two examples of faith at the Canada branch,

00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:47.599
Tilly and Leona Lachmouth, showed faith like Abraham's when they stepped out of their comfort zone

00:20:47.599 --> 00:20:53.680
to preach in a faraway land. But that wasn't the only big adjustment they would make in their

00:20:53.680 --> 00:21:01.359
long-theocratic history. In their interview, look for the challenge that came after nearly 50 years

00:21:01.359 --> 00:21:08.400
in their assignment. We were brought up in a small town in Saskatchewan. It was friendly.

00:21:09.359 --> 00:21:13.519
I don't think they moved to other places. They stayed right there.

00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:22.559
One time our father said, why do you have to go so far as India? Why can't you preach in Canada?

00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:30.759
That was very strict. When we were out playing and he came out and called us, we had to come

00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:37.799
immediately. It was strict. Don't question. Do what you're talking. Do what you're talking. That's right.

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:47.240
Strict. My father was the one that was interested, but he never came in the truth. He enjoyed having

00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:53.240
witnesses come to our home, but he never ever thought of himself as being one or Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:21:54.039 --> 00:21:59.720
Coming in the truth, I think, changed our life and we had a different purpose.

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:08.480
So that's when we decided, well, I guess we should pioneer now, too. And we only pioneer two

00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:17.440
years and we were called to Gilead. So then we graduated in 1953. When your application in Gilead,

00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:23.200
one question is, are you willing to go any place in the world? Brothers and sisters would say,

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:30.160
a one-way ticket. So that was on your mind. We were happy to go and if we didn't get back,

00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:40.240
then it was okay. And then the 13 of us for one month, we all went together back to India on a ship.

00:22:41.279 --> 00:22:46.960
Well, we're bit nervous because we didn't know just what kind of people we would be meeting or

00:22:47.039 --> 00:22:53.680
what kind of atmosphere we'd be experiencing. That's why it was a shock when we landed in Bombay

00:22:54.559 --> 00:23:02.720
because all we could see was people, people everywhere and noise. And then they gave us such hot

00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:08.720
food. We were burning all the way down. And then when we arrived there,

00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:13.920
missionary home had no furniture and we had a sleep on the floor from quite a few months before

00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:19.680
the furniture was made. We boiled our water, we filled our water. When we went to the market,

00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:24.400
we'd bring all our vegetables and fruit home and we washed them with the solution. And we were

00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:30.960
very careful in that respect. It was all a shock to us in many things. Yes. We made about mind,

00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:36.240
I guess, such. It's not going to be the same as Canada, we know. We didn't worry about things

00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:42.799
we had to put up with because we had the joy in the ministry. The society wanted us to get the

00:23:42.799 --> 00:23:48.240
joy booklet out. And we had to just stand on the street with this carton of literature and just

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:53.279
keep calling out to the people and everybody would take it. And they were so appreciative. Yeah,

00:23:53.279 --> 00:24:00.640
they were appreciative. Yeah. In those days, we had to put in 150 hours. And in South India,

00:24:01.279 --> 00:24:08.079
after four, women were not out. So we had to get all our time in early in the morning and work

00:24:08.079 --> 00:24:18.039
right through till four o'clock. Sure did. We were using the Malayalam language and the children

00:24:18.039 --> 00:24:24.519
repeated what we said. They run ahead and tell people what we were talking about. And they'd all

00:24:24.519 --> 00:24:31.960
yell, madama, madama, white woman, white woman. And we had many studies in. We enjoyed the

00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:37.880
ministry and we enjoyed the hospitality. Be with the brothers and go to their homes and eat their

00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:43.480
food and do things the way they do things. So we had to make India our home.

00:24:45.079 --> 00:24:51.799
We lived in India about 50 years. And then the news came that we had to leave. So that's why the

00:24:51.799 --> 00:24:58.839
governing body said, well, you go to Canada branch then. Well, it's just like culture shock too.

00:24:58.839 --> 00:25:03.720
It has to be so many years in India. A lot of things we had to sort of adjust here now.

00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:13.259
I'm working down in the laundry. Falling. Same. Falling and falling till we fall in.

00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:23.259
Oh, you always tell the younger ones to be in the full-time service serving Jehovah.

00:25:23.259 --> 00:25:28.619
But this we think is a wonderful life to choose. It's good for the young people to learn when

00:25:28.619 --> 00:25:33.579
they're young like that. And no doubt they'll make progress in the truth too.

00:25:33.579 --> 00:25:41.500
Glad we started pioneering and moved about. Yeah, we lacked nothing really. Nothing to complain about.

00:25:46.619 --> 00:25:53.420
It wasn't easy. But Tilly and Leona adapted to a culture in India that was very different from

00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:59.420
what they knew. It was interesting, however, that they felt a similar culture shock when returning

00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:07.339
home to Canada. But through all of it, Jehovah rewarded their faith. After more than 67 years of

00:26:07.339 --> 00:26:15.099
full-time service, they can say with confidence that they lacked nothing. Young ones, why not

00:26:15.099 --> 00:26:21.900
imitate the faith of ones like Tilly and Leona and set a goal for a form of service that's new to

00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:28.539
you? And older ones, if an assignment you treasured for many years comes to an end,

00:26:29.259 --> 00:26:35.500
know that Jehovah remembers the love you showed for his name and wants you to find joy in your

00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:42.539
new assignment. No matter our circumstances, Jehovah wants us all to do what was recently

00:26:42.539 --> 00:26:50.779
discussed at a Bethel Morning worship. Seek first the kingdom. Our text for discussion today

00:26:50.779 --> 00:27:00.299
here in Matthew 6 verse 33 contains two parts. The first part is what we have to do. It says,

00:27:00.299 --> 00:27:07.660
keep on then seeking first the kingdom and his righteousness. The second part is what your

00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:15.579
hovered will do and all these other things will be added to you. We think carefully about these

00:27:15.579 --> 00:27:24.220
words. Jesus actually was educating his disciples to make a dramatic change in their lifestyle.

00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:34.059
What do we mean by that? Well, look at verse 31. He says, so never, we anxious and say,

00:27:34.059 --> 00:27:41.740
what are we to eat, or what are we to drink, or what are we to wear. Did Jesus say never?

00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:50.140
Yes, but those are the things we normally do. We are anxious about our existence.

00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:58.859
And Jesus recognizes that most people are that way. He says in verse 32, for all these other

00:27:58.859 --> 00:28:07.900
things the nations are eagerly pursuing. But then he says, your heavenly Father knows that you

00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:16.940
need all these things. Here in this chapter, Jesus outlines a number of very important principles

00:28:17.819 --> 00:28:25.819
that actually change the way we look at life and the way we see our existence in relationship to

00:28:25.819 --> 00:28:35.019
Jehovah God. He puts service to Jehovah in the first place, regardless of our circumstances.

00:28:35.819 --> 00:28:43.099
Let us have a look at two of these principles. The one is here in Matthew 6 verse 24. He says,

00:28:44.059 --> 00:28:51.180
no one can slave for two masters. For either he will hate the one and love the other,

00:28:51.900 --> 00:29:00.940
or he will stick to the one and despise the other. You cannot slave for God and for riches.

00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:09.339
It is just not possible. Some have tried, but they failed. Satan approached Jesus and said to him,

00:29:09.339 --> 00:29:14.460
I will give you riches. I will give you all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.

00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:23.420
Of course, Jesus refused. Why? Because he knew there was a price attached to it. What is the price?

00:29:24.539 --> 00:29:31.980
Worship, divided worship, which is impossible. He knew it is impossible to worship both Jehovah and

00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:42.220
riches. In verse 21, Jesus says, for where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.

00:29:46.359 --> 00:29:57.079
The second principle is in verse 25. On this account, I say to you, stop being anxious

00:29:57.079 --> 00:30:03.480
about your lives as to what you will eat or what you will drink or about your bodies as to what

00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:12.200
you will wear, and here is the principle. Does not life mean more than food and the body more than

00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:20.119
clothing? You can have a storehouse full of food. If you don't have life, you cannot eat it.

00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:26.440
You can have a warehouse full of clothes, but if there is no body, you cannot wear it.

00:30:27.079 --> 00:30:40.759
Jesus illustrated this principle beautifully in Luke. Turn to Luke, chapter 12, and from verse 16,

00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:48.599
with that he told him an illustration saying, the land of a rich man produced well. So he began

00:30:48.599 --> 00:30:54.759
reasoning within himself, what should I do now that I have nowhere to gather my crops? Then he

00:30:54.839 --> 00:31:01.640
said, I will do this. I will tear down my storehouses and build bigger ones. And there I will gather

00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:08.440
all my grain and all my goods. And I will say to myself, you have many good things stored up for

00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:17.480
many years. Take it easy, eat, drink, enjoy yourself. But God said to him, and reasonable one.

00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:25.240
This night they are demanding your life from you, who then is to have the things you stored up.

00:31:26.599 --> 00:31:33.000
So it goes with a man who stores up treasurer for himself, but is not rich toward God.

00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:43.960
Jesus didn't say this man was dishonest, or that he never thought about God. The mistake the man

00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:53.799
made was his priorities were wrong. He focused primarily on amassing wealth. He did not do what

00:31:53.799 --> 00:32:00.920
it says in verse 21. He did not store up treasurer for himself. He stored up treasurer for himself,

00:32:01.559 --> 00:32:08.759
but did not store up treasurer with God in heaven. He was not rich toward God. And that is the key

00:32:08.759 --> 00:32:16.759
element, isn't it? Our service to Jehovah God, our life for Jehovah, that is the key element.

00:32:17.319 --> 00:32:24.920
And as Jesus says in verse 15, the second part of verse 15, because even when a person has an

00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:34.680
abundance, his life does not result from the things he possesses. So these are the two very important

00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:42.920
principles we've covered. First of all, make our service to God the priority and not amassing wealth.

00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:52.359
And the second one, keep on then seeking first the kingdom and God's righteousness. And all these

00:32:52.359 --> 00:32:58.839
other things will be added to you. We do not know precisely when the end will come, but we want to

00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:05.799
keep on seeking first the kingdom. Rather than putting our trust in the securities of this world,

00:33:06.599 --> 00:33:16.200
we want to put our trust in our heavenly Father. Jehovah gives everything. He gives more than what

00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:25.400
we need. In Italy's haze, this five, verse 19, it summarizes this whole principle. It establishes

00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:35.720
the truth, the reality of the matter. It says, it leads us to five, verse 19. Also, when the true

00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:43.799
God gives a man riches and material possessions along with the ability to enjoy them,

00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:53.480
he should take his reward and rejoice in his hard work. This is the gift of God.

00:33:55.480 --> 00:34:00.839
Did you note two things that Brother Moray said could prevent us from seeking the kingdom first

00:34:00.839 --> 00:34:08.599
in our lives? One was being divided, trying to serve Jehovah while seeking riches or other things

00:34:08.599 --> 00:34:17.320
in the world. The second was anxiety over what we need to survive. We can avoid both of these

00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:25.079
distractions by building up our faith that Jehovah cares for us. We're assured that he will provide

00:34:25.079 --> 00:34:32.760
for our needs in this system, and in the new world we know he'll satisfy any wholesome desires

00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:41.159
that we choose to sacrifice for now. It may help to recall what Jehovah has already done for us.

00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:48.840
Can you remember your faith growing when you first studied the Bible, when you began your ministry

00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:54.920
sharing the kingdom good news, when you dedicated your life to God, or when he helped you through a

00:34:54.920 --> 00:35:02.440
serious trial? If so, you can say with conviction that faith makes things happen,

00:35:03.719 --> 00:35:09.239
and you can appreciate the experiences depicted in this encouraging music video.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:39:19.449
Nothing we experience is too difficult for Jehovah. That may be easy to remember when things are

00:39:19.449 --> 00:39:28.570
going well, but when anxiety or trials come, can we remember to trust Jehovah? What was one thing

00:39:28.570 --> 00:39:36.730
our sister did to build her faith? She prayed, even Jesus apostles begged him, give us more faith

00:39:37.449 --> 00:39:43.289
We can ask Jehovah for more faith, and then act with the courage and strength that he provides.

00:39:45.289 --> 00:39:52.730
Jehovah gives us his Holy Spirit, both individually and as a group. To see evidence of that,

00:39:53.289 --> 00:39:58.730
we need only go to a part of the world where Jehovah's people were put under intense pressure.

00:39:59.690 --> 00:40:07.769
In South Africa, for example, the government's policy of racial segregation called apartheid lasted

00:40:07.769 --> 00:40:16.489
for 46 years until 1994. Our brothers were pressured to take sides in armed conflict. Their

00:40:16.489 --> 00:40:22.250
freedom to worship together was limited, and the prevailing attitudes towards people of different

00:40:22.250 --> 00:40:28.889
races threatened their unity. In this report, we learn how our South African brothers

00:40:28.889 --> 00:40:47.099
remained united and neutral in support of God's kingdom. One afternoon when we came to the station,

00:40:47.099 --> 00:40:53.659
there were men who were directing things, and we were directed to a coach, white stone. That

00:40:53.739 --> 00:40:59.260
was the first time that we saw apartheid being law enforced.

00:41:02.139 --> 00:41:07.340
You could not leave the black areas where your home was without getting a permit.

00:41:08.619 --> 00:41:14.860
We were even given a permit that stipulated which area we were allowed to do their preaching work in.

00:41:18.119 --> 00:41:24.360
People would always ask us, what are you doing to fight apartheid? We had to boldly tell them,

00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:30.519
God's kingdom is the only solution. God will help the whole earth to live in peace one day,

00:41:30.519 --> 00:41:39.599
so we cannot take sides on political issues now. Here at home in Soweto, we heard the sound of

00:41:39.599 --> 00:41:47.719
children running in the streets. We heard the sound of gunshots. Tear gas was everywhere.

00:41:49.559 --> 00:41:54.679
When my husband came home that day, we sat with the children and took out the book,

00:41:54.679 --> 00:41:59.880
your youth getting the best out of it, and we studied the topic, how do you view your parents?

00:42:02.670 --> 00:42:07.550
This was appropriate because children had the spirit of rebelling against their own parents.

00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:17.880
They went as far as burning people. They came shouting my son's name,

00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:24.440
Aquila, Matiba, come out, come out. And one of them defended him and said,

00:42:25.159 --> 00:42:33.960
no, no, no, not Aquila. Aquila does not do these things. He will never protest.

00:42:38.119 --> 00:42:43.079
I saw Jehovah's hand in this. Even under those circumstances,

00:42:44.039 --> 00:42:47.880
Jehovah helped our children not to dwell on the madness in the streets,

00:42:48.679 --> 00:42:58.250
and we focused on spiritual things. In 1968, when I was 19 years old, I was sentenced to jail

00:42:58.250 --> 00:43:05.369
for refusing to do military service. Over a period of 20 years, close to a thousand young white

00:43:05.369 --> 00:43:12.250
witness men, somebody took their stand for neutrality in this country. We used to pray for our

00:43:12.250 --> 00:43:19.929
white brothers in prison. People in the black townships respected us for the stand these brothers

00:43:20.010 --> 00:43:33.210
were taking. In 1974, over 30,000 black and white brothers met for the afternoon session of

00:43:33.210 --> 00:43:42.650
the divine victory assembly. When we first arrived, there were policemen everywhere,

00:43:45.369 --> 00:43:51.449
but after half an hour, they saw how peaceful it was and so they left.

00:43:54.539 --> 00:44:02.780
For those few hours in the dark era of apartheid, we felt that glorious brotherly love,

00:44:02.780 --> 00:44:10.860
as we praised Jehovah together, about to miss a Uchehova.

00:44:16.059 --> 00:44:20.460
But the Moses Niyamuzwa was asked by a group on their way to a political rally,

00:44:21.420 --> 00:44:28.619
to weld weapons for them. He refused to do so. After their rally, they went back to him and said,

00:44:29.420 --> 00:44:35.179
you refused to weld our weapons, and some of our comrades were killed in a fight at the rally.

00:44:35.980 --> 00:44:44.059
Now you will die. Brother Niyamuzwa maintained his neutrality all the way to death,

00:44:44.860 --> 00:44:55.579
and Jehovah will remember him. In 1993, I was amazed when a white person came

00:44:55.579 --> 00:45:01.179
preaching house to house. They came with another white man who could speak vendor fluently.

00:45:01.179 --> 00:45:07.980
They excited me a lot, and as time went by, I came to realize that this is the true religion,

00:45:07.980 --> 00:45:12.539
because they were faithful friends and they spoke to me like we were family.

00:45:14.059 --> 00:45:19.099
In the 1980s, the government granted us permission to come in and build kingdom halls

00:45:19.099 --> 00:45:25.099
in the black townships. The local community were absolutely amazed to see all these whites

00:45:25.099 --> 00:45:31.019
pouring in and working harder along with their black brothers to build these beautiful kingdom halls.

00:45:31.019 --> 00:45:35.260
It was a wonderful privilege to get to know other young people of different races.

00:45:36.059 --> 00:45:40.860
Everyone in the congregation feels like family, as long as they serve Jehovah.

00:45:45.019 --> 00:46:02.269
Today in South Africa, there are more than 100,000 witnesses worshipping together in spirit and truth.

00:46:03.469 --> 00:46:10.269
South Africa has 11 official languages. Yet across that cultural variety, our brothers and sisters

00:46:10.269 --> 00:46:16.590
are all speaking the pure language, the truth about Jehovah God and His purposes.

00:46:17.309 --> 00:46:24.590
When we build strong faith in times of peace, we can find courage during times of testing and

00:46:24.590 --> 00:46:31.389
persecution. Rather rocky web from the United States learned to be a fighter as a young man,

00:46:32.349 --> 00:46:38.429
but as His faith grew, He learned that Jehovah is there to help us and to fight our battles.

00:46:39.389 --> 00:47:02.920
All of us are going to be tested one way or the other before we back it into the new world.

00:47:05.179 --> 00:47:12.300
And if we can endure those tests faithfully, faithfully, then you'll make it.

00:47:15.559 --> 00:47:23.480
My dad and my mother taught me the truth. What drove me to be baptized was the invention

00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:29.719
in Washington, D.C. Brother Rutherford gave the talk on the make-shell inherit the earth.

00:47:30.599 --> 00:47:36.679
But it touched my heart in a way that it should be ever left from the better don't.

00:47:36.679 --> 00:47:41.960
I don't up to now gave me faith to stay with you over all the way.

00:47:45.289 --> 00:47:50.570
The bullies would cover Jehovah to me and I would come home pretty well beat up,

00:47:50.570 --> 00:47:54.489
but so that's when I started trading for boxing.

00:47:55.210 --> 00:48:00.170
I was offered $40,000 for a fight, went or lose.

00:48:00.969 --> 00:48:04.650
And if I won the second fight, they would double the amount.

00:48:06.570 --> 00:48:10.409
Brother McMillan was like a second dad to me and my brother.

00:48:11.610 --> 00:48:16.489
And he asked me, says, would you do me a favor? He says don't put the gloves on no more.

00:48:17.449 --> 00:48:21.130
And so I didn't put him on anymore.

00:48:21.130 --> 00:48:26.570
And I think he knew that it wouldn't be very long for an article on it.

00:48:28.090 --> 00:48:31.610
It came out and told us that boxing wasn't for the Christians.

00:48:32.570 --> 00:48:37.690
I was drafted during this time and refused to serve and was sent to prison.

00:48:38.650 --> 00:48:47.130
All the time, I never, never, ever slowed down on my their credit deals. Never.

00:48:48.090 --> 00:48:54.250
I kept right on on it. The jail warden overheard me witnessing to another inmate.

00:48:55.050 --> 00:48:59.210
He told me don't do any more of that, says we don't allow it here.

00:49:00.170 --> 00:49:04.650
Three days from past by and he seen me talking to him again.

00:49:05.369 --> 00:49:09.769
And they put me in a car that was shaded.

00:49:10.650 --> 00:49:15.920
And he couldn't see out. I didn't know where I was going.

00:49:16.639 --> 00:49:20.880
No old prison, just dark as it could be in there.

00:49:22.239 --> 00:49:28.000
It was three feet around and they called it the sweat box.

00:49:30.199 --> 00:49:32.920
All the time I was in there, just sweat, sweat, sweat.

00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:43.239
And I went in and went at 213 pounds and I came out and went 133 pounds.

00:49:45.849 --> 00:49:57.050
Psalms 144 says, made Jehovah be praised, who trains my hand for battle, my fingers for warfare.

00:49:57.050 --> 00:50:07.530
My gave my life to get Jehovah my faith. I lived and we woke up.

00:50:08.170 --> 00:50:11.050
Several congregations would come together to work.

00:50:11.849 --> 00:50:14.090
We were confronted by mobs.

00:50:15.530 --> 00:50:21.610
There was a lot of them that was injured. I had 80 stitches to turn up here.

00:50:22.570 --> 00:50:28.570
And I had 13 in the side there on each tab.

00:50:29.769 --> 00:50:32.489
I was really, really beat up.

00:50:34.489 --> 00:50:37.449
But I couldn't have stood up if it hadn't been for Jehovah.

00:50:37.849 --> 00:50:40.409
I knew he was with me somewhere and other.

00:50:42.619 --> 00:50:46.780
So we sued the town and won $20,000.

00:50:47.739 --> 00:50:56.139
The society called us and said, you did very good in what all you've done.

00:50:57.099 --> 00:51:01.019
But says remember, we're not out for money.

00:51:02.619 --> 00:51:05.659
Make sure that that's made known to them.

00:51:06.219 --> 00:51:10.699
When we walked up to the desk, we slid the papers out to us.

00:51:11.820 --> 00:51:15.099
He says, sign them up and we just took and slid them back.

00:51:17.400 --> 00:51:18.679
It came out in the papers.

00:51:19.800 --> 00:51:25.320
Tell them to come back and do all they want to do in a way of their witness.

00:51:26.840 --> 00:51:28.599
Says we won't touch them.

00:51:28.599 --> 00:51:32.679
They were really happy to respect us for what we did.

00:51:34.280 --> 00:51:41.880
And so that opened it up and you've had a real good congregation there,

00:51:42.760 --> 00:51:44.039
got started and everything.

00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:55.920
My first life was a blessing for me.

00:51:57.119 --> 00:52:01.440
But when she died, Jehovah stepped down and gave me another good one.

00:52:02.320 --> 00:52:03.920
We both alone together.

00:52:06.159 --> 00:52:08.800
No, no, we do most ever thing together.

00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:12.880
We started to feel it in our hearts.

00:52:14.719 --> 00:52:18.960
When you give your faith to Jehovah, you give your life to him.

00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:22.400
He's permitted these things to come up only.

00:52:22.960 --> 00:52:23.760
I knew that.

00:52:24.639 --> 00:52:25.679
But he protected me.

00:52:29.960 --> 00:52:33.320
Brother Webb is now 94 years old.

00:52:33.960 --> 00:52:37.400
But as we saw, he and his wife, Charlene,

00:52:37.400 --> 00:52:39.400
keep themselves spiritually active.

00:52:40.440 --> 00:52:43.800
What lessons did you see in Rocky's experience?

00:52:44.679 --> 00:52:48.519
For one, we heard that Rocky learned to be a boxer,

00:52:48.519 --> 00:52:50.280
to protect himself from bullies.

00:52:51.239 --> 00:52:54.760
Yet he responded in faith to loving counsel to quit,

00:52:55.480 --> 00:53:00.360
even before God's people had a clear understanding of violent sports.

00:53:01.400 --> 00:53:07.000
Making that change help Rocky to continue cultivating a Christ-like personality.

00:53:08.039 --> 00:53:12.119
That prepared him to stand firm when imprisoned for his faith.

00:53:13.159 --> 00:53:18.199
And it helped him to not return evil for evil when persecuted for his ministry.

00:53:19.079 --> 00:53:23.079
He had faith that although Jehovah permitted these things to happen,

00:53:23.079 --> 00:53:25.320
he was also there to protect him.

00:53:27.079 --> 00:53:32.679
Examples like those of Rocky and the others we've considered warm our hearts

00:53:33.480 --> 00:53:37.880
and let us know we're never alone in our fight for the faith.

00:53:39.559 --> 00:53:43.480
Like you, our brothers around the world are standing firm

00:53:44.119 --> 00:53:47.800
and earnestly seeking out people to show them what the Bible teaches.

00:53:48.760 --> 00:53:53.320
Later this month, you'll enjoy hearing a report from the Central America branch.

00:53:54.039 --> 00:53:59.639
Preaching campaigns organized by the branch are reaching people in seldom-work territories

00:53:59.639 --> 00:54:06.519
across several countries such as Mexico, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Panama,

00:54:06.519 --> 00:54:08.599
Nicaragua, and Guatemala.

00:54:09.480 --> 00:54:14.280
Later, when it is posted, you'll find it in the video on Demand Section

00:54:14.280 --> 00:54:16.440
under our meetings and ministry.

00:54:18.199 --> 00:54:24.119
We'd like to conclude our program with a visit to the Catania Fleming English congregation

00:54:24.119 --> 00:54:25.960
on the beautiful island of Sicily.

00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:31.639
The small congregation has 46 publishers and 16 pioneers,

00:54:32.440 --> 00:54:36.840
but they're conducting on average more than 60 Bible studies.

00:54:37.559 --> 00:54:42.840
Critical times in this system of things are also giving them special opportunities

00:54:42.840 --> 00:54:48.039
in the ministry. Their territory includes one of the largest refugee camps in Europe.

00:54:48.840 --> 00:54:53.239
It provides shelter to people coming from countries such as Nigeria,

00:54:53.239 --> 00:54:56.599
Gambia, Ghana, Eritrea, and Somalia.

00:54:57.320 --> 00:55:03.719
Each week, a group of publishers drives an hour to the camp to give a witness and conduct studies.

00:55:04.840 --> 00:55:09.000
Residents from the camp also come by bus to attend the weekend meeting.

00:55:09.880 --> 00:55:16.360
The brothers and sisters of the Catania Fleming English congregation send you their loving greetings.

00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:22.440
We thank Jehovah for their willing spirit to bring comfort to others with the good news.

00:55:23.719 --> 00:55:29.159
Thank you for being with us this month. From the World Headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:55:29.159 --> 00:55:37.559
this is JW Broadcasting.
