00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:08.070
Today's Watchtower comments focus on the subject of envy and mention that Jehovah's

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:13.070
servants have been targets of envy throughout history.

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.070
We will consider these questions.

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.070
What is envy?

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:27.070
How did Jehovah help Isaac, the son of Abraham, to stay safe from envious people?

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.070
And how can we deal with envy today?

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.070
So, what is envy?

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.070
Is it the same as greed or covetousness?

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.070
No, it is not.

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:45.070
A greedy person is someone who has an excessive desire to have more.

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:50.070
A covetous person is someone who also has an excessive desire to have more.

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.070
But what he wants already belongs to someone else.

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.070
And what is an envious person?

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.070
An envious person doesn't just want to have more.

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.069
He wants others to have less.

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:12.069
Further, as used in the Bible, an envious person may be having such deep-seated resentment toward others

00:01:12.069 --> 00:01:17.069
that he will even try to destroy what others have.

00:01:17.069 --> 00:01:21.069
Does envy is not an expression of greed.

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:25.069
Envy is an expression of hatred.

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:33.069
No wonder that the Apostle Paul stated, those who are full of envy, are deserving of death.

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:39.069
Now, with that description of envy in mind, let us consider our next question.

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:44.069
How did Jehovah protect Isaac from envious people?

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:49.069
We find the answer in Genesis chapter 26.

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:56.069
Now, before we read a couple of verses together, here is some background information.

00:01:56.069 --> 00:02:03.069
Isaac and Rebecca are on the way to Egypt to escape from a famine in the land of Canaan.

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:10.069
When they reach Gaerah in the south of Canaan, Jehovah speaks to Isaac.

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:15.069
As we read that Genesis 26 first stood, Jehovah states,

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:23.069
Do not go down to Egypt, dwell in the land that I designate to you.

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:32.580
In verse 3, we read that Jehovah also assures Isaac of his protection.

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:43.580
First three states, reside as a foreigner in this land, and I will continue to with you and bless you.

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.580
How does Isaac react? We read in verse 6,

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:55.580
Isaac continued to dwell in Gaerah. He obeyed Jehovah's command.

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:05.580
Now, interestingly, 75 years earlier, Abraham and Sarah also had lived for a while in Gaerah.

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:15.580
During that time, Abraham's servants had the wells that provided Abraham's household with the water they needed.

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:23.580
Abraham even carried out a transaction with the king of the land that made him the owner of a well.

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:32.580
So, later, when Isaac and Rebecca were in Gaerah, they used the wells that Abraham had acquired.

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:39.580
Now, did Isaac receive the blessing that Jehovah had promised?

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:42.580
Now, we find a clear answer at verse 12,

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:52.580
and Isaac began to sow seed in that land, and in that year, he reaped 100 times what he sowed.

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:58.580
Now, imagine this was tired during a time of famine.

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:01.580
So, what was the cause of that amazing harvest?

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:08.580
That the last part of verse 12 gives the reason for Jehovah was blessing him.

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:14.580
And as we know, when Jehovah blesses his servants, he does often abundantly,

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:18.579
and that was certainly the case with Isaac. Note verse 13,

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:21.579
the man became wealthy.

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:25.579
Now, did the blessing stop after this first year harvest?

00:04:25.579 --> 00:04:33.579
No, the first adds. He continued to prosper until he became very wealthy.

00:04:33.579 --> 00:04:38.579
Then, likely some years went by, and as we read at verse 14,

00:04:38.579 --> 00:04:45.579
Isaac acquired flocks of sheep and herds of cattle and a large body of servants.

00:04:45.579 --> 00:04:48.579
Now, what was the reaction of the people around Isaac?

00:04:48.579 --> 00:04:56.579
The last part of verse 14 adds, the Philistines began to envy him.

00:04:56.579 --> 00:05:04.579
Now, as we considered, one characteristic of envious people is that they have such resentment toward others

00:05:04.579 --> 00:05:09.579
that they want to deprive of what they have.

00:05:09.579 --> 00:05:14.579
Now, did the people who confronted Isaac fill that description?

00:05:14.579 --> 00:05:22.579
Look at verse 15, so the Philistines took soil and stopped up all the wells

00:05:22.579 --> 00:05:27.579
that his father's servants had dug in the days of Abraham.

00:05:27.579 --> 00:05:34.579
So, what they did was not an act of stealing, but an act of willful destruction.

00:05:34.579 --> 00:05:41.579
They wanted to cause harm to Isaac and his family by depriving him of the wells.

00:05:41.579 --> 00:05:45.579
But Jehovah protected Isaac.

00:05:45.579 --> 00:05:51.579
How? As we see at verse 24, Jehovah assured Isaac of his protection

00:05:51.579 --> 00:05:56.579
with the strengthening words, do not be afraid.

00:05:56.579 --> 00:05:59.579
I am with you.

00:05:59.579 --> 00:06:03.579
Now, this is the first recorded instance in the Bible

00:06:03.579 --> 00:06:09.579
that Jehovah spoke the words I am with you to one of his servants.

00:06:09.579 --> 00:06:17.579
We can imagine how simple but powerful statements strengthened Isaac's faith.

00:06:17.579 --> 00:06:21.579
And Jehovah kept his promise to Isaac.

00:06:21.579 --> 00:06:29.579
In fact, the evidence of Jehovah's protection and blessing was so convincing that even Isaac's enemies later had to admit,

00:06:29.579 --> 00:06:38.579
as we read at verse 28, we have clearly seen that Jehovah has been with you.

00:06:38.579 --> 00:06:42.579
Today, what can we learn from this account?

00:06:42.579 --> 00:06:49.579
We should clearly keep in mind Jehovah's reassuring words I am with you.

00:06:49.579 --> 00:06:57.579
Why? Because soon, we also will become the target of envy.

00:06:57.579 --> 00:07:01.579
As God's words revealed after the start of the great revelation,

00:07:01.579 --> 00:07:06.579
the kings of the earth will form a coalition of nations that will attack us.

00:07:06.579 --> 00:07:11.579
Ezekiel describes that coalition as God of Maygok.

00:07:11.579 --> 00:07:16.579
But what motivates God of Maygok to attack us?

00:07:16.579 --> 00:07:22.579
The watchtower stated, God of Maygok will attack God's people,

00:07:22.579 --> 00:07:28.579
being envious of their peace and prosperity.

00:07:28.579 --> 00:07:35.579
Now, what is the prosperity or wealth that turns us into a target of envy and hatred?

00:07:36.579 --> 00:07:42.579
In our case, we will not be attacked because of our great material wealth.

00:07:42.579 --> 00:07:49.579
Instead, God of Maygok will attack us because of our great spiritual wealth.

00:07:49.579 --> 00:07:54.579
We are spiritually wealthy because we live in a spiritual paradise.

00:07:54.579 --> 00:08:03.579
Our most precious possession is our worship to Jehovah, which we give to Jehovah alone.

00:08:04.579 --> 00:08:11.579
Now, just that mean that the nations will attack us because they see the value of pure worship?

00:08:11.579 --> 00:08:13.579
Think back to the time of Isaac.

00:08:13.579 --> 00:08:20.579
Did the attackers see the value of the wells and use them for themselves?

00:08:20.579 --> 00:08:26.579
No, they plundered and ruined the wells because they hated Isaac.

00:08:26.579 --> 00:08:31.579
Now, a similar motive will drive the coalition of nations.

00:08:31.579 --> 00:08:36.580
The pure worship book stays on page 188.

00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:46.580
The nations will seek to plunder pure worship, not because they value it, but because they hate it.

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:53.580
The nations who envy us are determined to destroy what we have.

00:08:53.580 --> 00:09:00.580
So, what will give us the inner strength when we become the target of envy?

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:08.580
We need to remain focused on the assurance that Jehovah repeated to faithful servants in Bible times.

00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:14.580
To Isaac, Jehovah said, I am with you.

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:19.580
To Jacob, Jehovah said, I am with you.

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:25.580
To faithful ones in Israel, Jehovah said, I am with you.

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:31.580
To Jeremiah, Jehovah said, I am with you.

00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:36.580
The more we meditate on why Jehovah was with these faithful ones of old,

00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:48.580
the stronger our trust will become that Jehovah will protect us against that attack of the envious coalition of nations.
