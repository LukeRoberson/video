00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:14.140
The feeling of guilt is so heavy.

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:17.140
Can I ever be part of Jehovah's organization

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:18.140
and feel good?

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.140
Can I feel clean?

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.140
Because the guilt made me feel like I wasn't.

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:28.140
I would pray to Jehovah and just plead with him.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.800
I would journal how I was feeling,

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.799
and then I would do the personal study.

00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:40.039
And when I was having a bad day, a real down day,

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:44.039
I would look and see, oh yeah, this is how Jehovah feels.

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:49.759
I felt a change in me when I studied about the ransom.

00:00:49.759 --> 00:00:53.759
Jesus died for everyone, even people who don't serve him.

00:00:53.759 --> 00:00:59.100
Then he died for me too.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.100
Feeling guilty can make you want to isolate,

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.099
but I knew that was dangerous,

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:07.099
because there's no growth, there's no encouragement for anyone.

00:01:07.099 --> 00:01:11.099
Reaching out and associating with the brothers and sisters

00:01:11.099 --> 00:01:14.099
really helped me not be so self-consumed.

00:01:14.099 --> 00:01:19.560
When I was able to comment again at meetings,

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.560
I started out small by saying like one word answers,

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.560
and then maybe a longer answer using a scripture.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.560
It gave me something to be proud of.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.060
Going in the ministry really helped me,

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.060
because I was talking about the wonderful hope

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.060
of the future that Jehovah gives,

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:42.060
and it was building my faith along with helping others.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.060
When you help others, it makes you happy.

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:51.939
When I look back from where I was,

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:55.939
feeling so guilty to where I am now,

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:01.349
I really see the wisdom in Jehovah and his discipline,

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:03.349
and it makes me feel proud.

00:02:03.349 --> 00:02:05.349
I'm very happy.
