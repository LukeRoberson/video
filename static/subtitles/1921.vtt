WEBVTT

00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:09.199
Welcome, brothers and sisters. Since our last update, we've had two more special conventions.

00:00:09.199 --> 00:00:19.199
Both were held in Chile. More than 4,700 delegates traveled from 21 countries to attend these two conventions.

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:29.199
There was a combined peak attendance of over 17,000 and 123 were baptized.

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:37.200
The special convention touched the hearts of many, including a delegate named Jonathan. He said,

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:57.200
The love you have shown us at every step of this trip, from the welcome at the airport to all the different activities, the beautiful gifts, the friends at the convention, the wonderful reception personnel at the hotel, it has been unbelievable.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:05.200
We thank Chahoba for allowing us to have this incredible experience, he said.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.200
A delegate named Jessica said,

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:19.629
Thank you for giving us a preview of the new world. Recently, we've had a number of significant natural disasters.

00:01:19.629 --> 00:01:28.629
In mid-September, storm Boris affected Central Europe, bringing heavy rain and powerful wind.

00:01:28.629 --> 00:01:34.629
Hundreds of our brothers and sisters were displaced and received relief aid.

00:01:34.629 --> 00:01:41.629
Meanwhile, Southern Africa continues to be affected by an unprecedented drought.

00:01:41.629 --> 00:01:53.629
Various branch offices, including Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe, have helped tens of thousands of our brothers to have the food they need.

00:01:53.629 --> 00:02:03.629
In late September and early October, hurricanes Helene and Milton devastated the Southeast and United States.

00:02:03.629 --> 00:02:16.629
The two storms caused devastating floods and landslides. Sadly, three publishers were killed. Over 11,000 of our brothers were displaced.

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:25.629
The storms damaged or destroyed 17 kingdom halls and more than 2,500 of our brothers' homes.

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:32.629
We continue to pray for all of our brothers who are affected by these disasters.

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:38.629
And we are grateful for the many volunteers who are supporting disaster relief.

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:49.629
Of course, we also appreciate the generous donations that allow us to care for the needs of our brothers who are facing these terrible situations.

00:02:49.629 --> 00:03:04.099
On September 27, 2024, authorities in Eritrea raided a private home where a peaceful meeting of Jehovah's Witnesses was being held.

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:14.099
Initially, the police arrested 24 of our brothers and sisters, including two minor children, later the children were released.

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:26.099
This raid occurred nearly 30 years after the President of Eritrea revoked the citizenship of Jehovah's Witnesses in 1994.

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:40.099
This decree is still in force and prevents the majority of Jehovah's Witnesses from leading a normal life, owning property, running a business, or even finding employment.

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:48.099
Days after the raid, the police arrested and imprisoned 85-year-old sister Leta Bairhan Tessfi.

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:59.099
Sister Leta Bairhan was one of the first in Eritrea to study the Bible with Jehovah's Witnesses. She was baptized in 1957.

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:10.099
Eight of her children and eight of her grandchildren are serving Jehovah. Her daughter, Hadassah Seressani, is imprisoned with her.

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:18.100
Sister Saron Gabriel and her husband were also arrested. Saron is about six months pregnant.

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:28.100
Saron's brother, Hinock, is the longest imprisoned brother in Eritrea at this time. He was first arrested in January 2005.

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:35.100
As of November 1, 64 of our brothers and sisters in Eritrea are imprisoned.

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:45.100
We continue to pray for the 223 brothers and sisters around the world who are currently imprisoned for their faith.

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:53.100
At the annual meeting on October 5, 2024, there was a very exciting announcement.

00:04:53.100 --> 00:05:01.100
Brothers Jody Jadley and Jacob Rumpf were appointed to serve as members of the governing body.

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:09.100
We are happy to have them with us in this studio. Let's spend a few minutes getting better acquainted with them.

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:15.100
Welcome, brothers. We have so many questions that we'd like to ask you.

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:21.100
But maybe you could help us to know a little bit about how you came to love Jehovah.

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:27.100
First, what helped you to come to know Jehovah so that you wanted to serve him?

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:28.100
Father Jody?

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:36.100
I was raised in the truth. Dad was baptized in the 1940s and he served faithfully until he passed away.

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:39.100
And mom was baptized in the 1950s.

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:42.100
They loved Jehovah in his organization.

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:48.100
So their love for Jehovah helped my sister in reformer relationship with Jehovah as well.

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:53.100
As I grew up and I learned the truth, the truth just made sense.

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:59.100
But what really convinced me that it was the best way of living was the love amongst Jehovah's people.

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:05.100
I remember during the summer vacations, brothers and sisters would come from around the country

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:08.100
to preach an unassigned territory near us.

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:11.100
And we didn't know these friends before they came.

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:14.100
But when they arrived, we were instant family.

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:17.100
And it was simply because we all served Jehovah.

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:20.100
And that had a real impression on me.

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:22.100
My parents were raised around the truth.

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:30.100
However, my mother was inactive and as I was growing up, my father was also not a witness.

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:36.100
Although we never really associated with a congregation, my mother did teach us basic Bible truths.

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:40.100
I knew God's name was Jehovah. I knew that I should only pray to Him.

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:45.100
And I also knew that the earth would be converted into a paradise.

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:51.100
Also, when I would visit my paternal grandmother once or twice a year, who was a very faithful witness,

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:57.100
I really felt drawn to Jehovah by her because of her words and her beautiful Christian qualities.

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:00.100
I wanted to know who Jehovah really was.

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:05.100
So when I was about 13 years old, I asked my mother if I could study the Bible.

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:10.100
I reasoned, well, if this really is the truth, then I wanted to be one of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:15.100
And if it wasn't the truth, well, then I still wanted to be a good person.

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:20.100
Interestingly, my mother had already been wanting to come back to Jehovah.

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:23.100
So we progressed together.

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:29.100
Soon after my study started, I realized that this was the truth that I was looking for.

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:34.100
My mother was reactivated, and a month later I was approved to be an unbaptized publisher.

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:38.100
Now I'm happy to say that my whole immediate family is in the truth,

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:42.100
and they continue to be an excellent example of faith for me.

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:47.100
Brother Rump, what motivated you to pursue full-time service?

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:55.100
I would say that the good example of mature pioneers that made the Pioneer service their career,

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:59.100
as well as circuit overseers that took an interest in me,

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:02.100
really had a big impact on me growing up.

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:07.100
I saw how happy they were and the stories they had of serving where the need was greater,

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:12.100
even some of them expanding their service into distant lands.

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:16.100
So all of that made me really want to be a missionary.

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:20.100
So after high school, I started in the Pioneer service.

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:27.100
My story is similar to Jake's being around those who enjoyed full-time service helped.

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:29.100
For example, our parents had the Pioneer spirit.

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:33.100
They both pioneered until the children came along,

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:38.100
and later Mom was able to start pioneering again, and she continues until now.

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:41.100
During summer vacations, we would auxiliary pioneers of family.

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:44.100
We'd go in the ministry with the circuit overseer,

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:47.100
and in most summers, we'd also visit Bethel.

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:51.100
All of those activities helped us to see first hand

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:54.100
that full-time service was simply a great way of life.

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:57.100
So when I finished high school, I began pioneering,

00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:59.100
and later I was invited to Bethel at 19.

00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:02.100
My sister and her husband also served at Bethel.

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:08.100
What had been some of your assignments over the years, and how have you benefited from them?

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:12.100
Well, I was assigned to the cleaning department when I came to Bethel at Walkill.

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:15.100
And it was a great crew. We enjoyed working with each other,

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:20.100
and working on different teams and on rotating schedules helped me see the need

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:24.100
to be adaptable to get work done.

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:26.100
About two and a half years later, I was transferred to the office

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:29.100
where I worked with staffing matters and medical matters,

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:33.100
and I was even able to help missionaries with medical care that they needed.

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:37.100
Later, Damaris and I got married, and we were transferred to Brooklyn,

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:40.100
where I also continued to work with medical matters.

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:46.100
We served in Brooklyn until 2005 when we left Bethel to help take care of parents.

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:52.100
We both pioneered, and I served on the hospital liaison committee and on the regional building committee.

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:55.100
We came back to Bethel eight years later for a two-week assignment

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:57.100
on the Warwick construction project.

00:09:57.100 --> 00:10:01.100
I guess it's lasted a little bit longer, we've been at Bethel ever since.

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:06.100
In 2015, we were transferred to Patterson to work with the newly formed local

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:09.100
design construction department or LDC.

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:14.100
In 2018, the LDC was moved to Walkill, so we went full circle.

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:18.100
We came back to where we started, and then in 2021,

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:21.100
I was assigned to the hospital information department,

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:27.100
and in 2022, we were transferred to Warwick to work with hospital information services.

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:31.100
In every assignment along the way,

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:35.100
it's been a privilege to learn from spiritual men and women.

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:40.100
Over the years, it was faith-strengthening to see brothers who carried heavy

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:42.100
theocratic responsibilities.

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:46.100
They set the example in being kind and humble.

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:49.100
They were glad to share their knowledge with the rest of us.

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:55.100
And when we were outside of Bethel, we saw how hard parents worked to raise their children in the truth

00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:59.100
and how the brothers and sisters love to support theocratic activities.

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:03.100
Jehovah truly has wonderful people, and I treasure those examples.

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:07.100
Yes, for me, in the 1998 Regional Convention,

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:11.100
I remember that there was a talk that highlighted several countries

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:16.100
where there was a need for pioneers, and one of those mentioned was Ecuador.

00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:20.100
So I prayed about it, I looked at my circumstances,

00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:23.100
I did some investigation, and after that convention,

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:27.100
I decided to write to the Ecuador branch for information.

00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:30.100
Well, after visiting to check it out, I was happy,

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:33.100
which Jehovah's helped to be able to make the move.

00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:37.100
And the territory was so amazing at that time.

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:40.100
Many right-hearted ones were searching for the truth.

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:44.100
My dream to serve in a missionary field was to come in a reality,

00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:51.100
but really the greatest blessing for me in serving in Ecuador was meeting my future wife, Inga.

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:54.100
And then after marriage, we continued serving,

00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:57.100
where the need was great, there in Ecuador.

00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:02.100
Several years later, we were assigned as special pioneers,

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:05.100
and eventually we started in the circuit work,

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:10.100
carrying for a circuit that included even some congregations in the Amazon jungle,

00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:12.100
and that was a lot of fun.

00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:19.100
Then in 2011, we were surprised to be invited to the 132nd Class of Gilead,

00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:23.100
which was also a great privilege for us.

00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:26.100
And after Gilead, our life has seen a lot of changes.

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:29.100
We've served in different parts of the world,

00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:32.100
and enjoyed many different privileges.

00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:35.100
But in all of these assignments, what we've really learned

00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:40.100
is to just be content to do our best with what Jehovah allows us to do each day.

00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:44.100
And to not get too worried about what we can't control.

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:50.100
Another thing that we've learned is that it's never the place that makes an assignment special,

00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:53.100
but it's the people really that you get to serve with.

00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:58.100
And we love those precious friends so much.

00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:04.100
Is there a scriptural thought that has strengthened you as you begin this new assignment?

00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:07.100
I think for me, the example of Joshua helps,

00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:11.100
and what Jehovah told him when he received a new assignment.

00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:16.100
Joshua had always been a courageous servant of Jehovah for decades.

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:18.100
He walked through the Red Sea.

00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:21.100
He led the Israelites in battle against the Amalakites.

00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:28.100
He was a spy, and he helped Moses for years in very difficult situations.

00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:32.100
Yet, a Joshua 19, interesting what Jehovah tells him,

00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:35.100
he tells him, have I not commanded you?

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:38.100
Be courageous and strong.

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:40.100
Do not be struck with terror or fear.

00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:46.100
And next, Jehovah reminds Joshua of why he could take on his new assignment.

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:54.100
He tells him, for Jehovah, your God is with you wherever you go.

00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:56.100
And that's really the point.

00:13:56.100 --> 00:14:00.100
Jehovah is with us as we take on new assignments.

00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:04.100
I look back and I know he helped me on all the other assignments over the years.

00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:07.100
So I know he'll help me with this assignment too.

00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:12.100
I also like that Jehovah told Joshua that he was with him.

00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:15.100
He was personal with Jehovah.

00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:17.100
And Jehovah hasn't changed.

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:19.100
So it's not about what I can do.

00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:21.100
It's about what he can do.

00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:23.100
And Jehovah can do anything.

00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:27.100
He personally supports each of his servants.

00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:32.100
So I can trust that Jehovah will be with me personally.

00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:34.100
He will help me care for the new assignment.

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:36.100
And that helps.

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:40.100
I personally feel a lot like Gideon felt when he received his assignment.

00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:47.100
He came from a normal background and he didn't think that he would really ever be able to make much of a difference.

00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:55.100
But Jehovah, through an angel, reminded him of an important fact at Judges 6 and verse 14.

00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:59.100
He told him, Go with the strength you have.

00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:02.100
And you will save Israel out of Midian's hand.

00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:05.100
Is it not I who send you?

00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:09.100
The reality is with Gideon's own strength, he couldn't do much.

00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:12.100
So Jehovah is basically telling Gideon,

00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:16.100
You just bring what you have to offer and I'll bring the rest.

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:23.100
To be honest, the thought of serving in this capacity was scary for me and my wife.

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:26.100
But we just want to try to imitate Gideon.

00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:30.100
Just do our best and let Jehovah make up the difference.

00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:36.100
This work is his and he will make sure that it continues successfully.

00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:38.100
Thank you, brothers.

00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:43.100
I remember 30 years ago when I first started serving on the governing body,

00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:49.100
I had some of those feelings as well and I know he'll help you too.

00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:59.100
We are so happy to have you on the governing body and we wish you Jehovah's blessing in your new assignment.

00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:03.100
And we continue to pray for all of you.

00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:09.100
We love you all very much from the World Headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:12.100
