00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:05.490
Welcome to the June program of J.W. Broadcasting.

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:31.660
As you likely remember, Gilead graduations are now featured as the monthly J.W. Broadcasting program once every six months.

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:39.659
For this program, we're excited to share with you the first part of the graduation of the 144th Class of Gilead,

00:00:39.659 --> 00:00:43.659
which took place on March 10, 2018.

00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:48.659
This program features scriptural talks within intriguing themes.

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:52.659
We know you'll enjoy these thought-provoking discussions.

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:58.659
In coming weeks, be on the lookout for parts two and three of the Gilead graduation.

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:05.659
You'll have an opportunity to get to know some of the students better during another heart stirring episode of The Inside Story.

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:15.659
But now, we invite you to enjoy part one of the graduation of the 144th Class of Gilead.

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.659
You'll see a picture on the monitors.

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:23.620
Take a look at it.

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.620
Take a good look.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:31.659
What's the occasion?

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:33.659
I'll give you a hint.

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:40.859
The picture was taken 75 years ago last month.

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:48.859
It's a picture of the very first day of the very first Class of Gilead.

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:56.859
So 75 years ago last month was the inception of Gilead.

00:01:56.859 --> 00:02:02.859
Now, Gilead, that's an interesting word, isn't it?

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:05.859
What does it mean?

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:17.400
Well, if you answer heap of witness, it shows that you're very familiar with the 1984 edition of the New World Translation.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:23.400
The 2013 edition says, witness pile.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:34.400
Now, there can be a difference between a heap and a pile, where I come from in Canada in the winter time and gets very cold.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:40.400
And to save on heating expenses, many families heat with a wood stove.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:47.400
So you go to the backyard and you see a very neat pile of wood stacked up.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.400
They're not careless about it.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.400
In fact, some of them are quite meticulous about their wood pile.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:03:00.400
If you appreciate the appearance of your home, some of them are very artistic, almost sculpted these wood piles.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:07.400
And we'll never call it a heap because a heap you'd think of wood that just being carelessly strewn right and left.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:13.400
But no, this is a wood pile. So something rather neat.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:18.400
So why are we talking about a witness pile?

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:27.400
Well, what was it? What was this heap of witness? What was this witness pile in the original meaning?

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.400
What purpose did it serve?

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:35.400
And why does it concern you members of the graduating class? It does.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:43.400
In fact, it concerns all of us. There's a lesson that all of us can learn from this witness pile called Gilead.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.400
Let's go to the origin.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.900
Back in Genesis chapter 31, Genesis chapter 31.

00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:03.280
Now a little context. The patriarch Jacob was tired of being cheated by his father-in-law, Laban.

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:08.280
And as we read the scriptures, we know that Laban was kind of a shady character.

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.280
You wouldn't want to buy a used car from Laban.

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:19.279
And so Jacob got tired of being cheated and so he ran away with his wives and his children.

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:29.279
Well, Laban ran after him. And when he caught up with Jacob, Laban and Jacob made a covenant of peace.

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:37.279
Now we take up the reading from verse 43. So this is Genesis 31 beginning with verse 43.

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:40.279
Then Laban answered Jacob,

00:04:40.279 --> 00:04:50.279
The daughters are my daughters and the children my children and the flock my flock and everything you are looking at is mine.

00:04:50.279 --> 00:04:54.279
It tells you what kind of a person he was, doesn't it? Verse 44.

00:04:54.279 --> 00:05:04.279
Now come. Let us make a covenant you and I and it will serve as a witness between us.

00:05:04.279 --> 00:05:12.279
So Jacob took a stone and set it up as a pillar. Then Jacob said to his brothers, pick up stones.

00:05:12.279 --> 00:05:24.279
And they took stones and made a pile. And notice this, after that they ate there on the pile of stones.

00:05:24.279 --> 00:05:35.279
So scholars tell us that this pile of stones must have been quite neatly arranged so that it would form a kind of a table.

00:05:35.279 --> 00:05:42.279
And they had their meal of peace on this table. And of course this was to serve as a monument.

00:05:42.279 --> 00:05:48.279
It was to be a monument of the covenant of peace between Laban and Jacob.

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:52.279
Now let us carry on. Verse 47.

00:05:52.279 --> 00:06:01.279
And Laban began calling it jigar say hiduta. But Jacob called it gallaeid.

00:06:01.279 --> 00:06:06.279
When the brothers were picking a name for the school, aren't you glad they didn't go with Laban?

00:06:06.279 --> 00:06:16.879
How would you students like to be graduates of the Watchtower Bible School of jigar dhalehuta? That would be a mouthful, wouldn't it?

00:06:17.879 --> 00:06:25.879
So they chose gallaeid or gileid. Verse 48 and 49. Laban then said,

00:06:25.879 --> 00:06:36.879
this pile of stones is a witness between me and you today. That is why he named it gallaeid and the Watchtower.

00:06:36.879 --> 00:06:43.879
And isn't it interesting that both Watchtower and gileid are in the name of our school?

00:06:43.879 --> 00:06:49.879
Now what was the purpose of the pile of rocks? Verse 52.

00:06:49.879 --> 00:07:01.879
This pile of stones is a witness. And the pillar is something that bears witness that I will not pass beyond this pile of stones to bring harm to you.

00:07:01.879 --> 00:07:09.879
And you will not pass beyond this pile of stones and this pillar to bring harm to me.

00:07:09.879 --> 00:07:19.879
So this gileid, this pile of stones, this witness pile, was really a monument.

00:07:19.879 --> 00:07:31.879
It was a symbol of peace and unity. And anytime someone would pass by that monument, that pile of stones, that witness heap, if you like.

00:07:31.879 --> 00:07:36.879
They would be reminded of the need for unity.

00:07:36.879 --> 00:07:42.879
Now the unity between Laban and Jacob didn't come about automatically.

00:07:42.879 --> 00:07:50.879
We read verse 43, did you notice the accusations that Laban made when he first encountered Jacob?

00:07:50.879 --> 00:07:57.879
The daughters are mine. The children are mine. The flocks are mine.

00:07:57.879 --> 00:08:04.879
Everything you see is mine. Well, then we're fighting words.

00:08:04.879 --> 00:08:14.879
Jacob had worked very hard for everything he got. He'd worked for 14 years for his wives. And Laban changed his wages 10 times.

00:08:14.879 --> 00:08:25.879
So Laban had no right to say that it was all his. And Jacob could have taken exception to it, but he bit his tongue. Why? The goal was peace.

00:08:25.879 --> 00:08:31.879
He wanted to make peace. So Jacob took the high road.

00:08:31.879 --> 00:08:44.879
Well, today, that name gileid is an appropriate name for our school. And it reminds us of the blessed unity that must prevail through the organization today.

00:08:44.879 --> 00:08:58.879
When you think of it, gileid has been a tremendous force to unify God's people. As missionaries were sent to the four corners of our corners of the earth, they were supplicating people to come into a peaceful relationship with your Hove of God.

00:08:59.879 --> 00:09:08.879
And as branches were formed, the missionaries understood how world headquarters worked. And they helped to promote unity between the branches and world headquarters.

00:09:08.879 --> 00:09:25.879
So the missionaries were agents of peace. And now, of course, the focus of gileid is on strengthening the congregations, strengthening the circuits, strengthening the branches for forging an unbreakable link between the branches and world headquarters.

00:09:25.879 --> 00:09:38.879
And gileid plays a part in all this. We are one flock under one shepherd. Don't hurt any member of the flock. Be a peacemaker.

00:09:38.879 --> 00:09:44.879
If you want peace, you have to work for it. And sometimes to achieve it, we have to bite our tongues.

00:09:44.879 --> 00:09:59.879
That was not a good lesson that you members of the graduating class can learn and all of us, because we all want to work for the peace of Jerusalem. We all want to work for the peace of Jehovah's organization.

00:09:59.879 --> 00:10:02.879
Well, back to the first class of gileid.

00:10:02.879 --> 00:10:17.879
Graduation day, June 23rd, 1943. Wait a minute. First day of class, February 1. Graduation day, June 23rd. That wasn't five months, wasn't.

00:10:17.879 --> 00:10:28.879
But they had a lovely graduation day. And the first to speak was a member of what would later become the governing body, Brother W.E. Van Ambre.

00:10:28.879 --> 00:10:41.879
Well, today at the graduation of the 144th class, we have a member of the governing body who will be first to speak, not Brother Van Ambre, but Brother Anthony Morris.

00:10:41.879 --> 00:10:47.879
And Tony is going to speak to us on the subject, supplicate all the time.

00:10:47.879 --> 00:11:03.860
You soon to be graduates are very familiar with the fact that in scripture, there's different forms of prayer.

00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:17.860
You have petition. We petition Jehovah for various needs. You have Thanksgiving so much to thank him for. And then, of course, Jehovah always deserves praise, so we'll have these prayers we offer to praise him.

00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:27.860
However, I just want to implant in your minds as you get ready to graduate and go to your assignments, this matter of supplication that's unique.

00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:42.860
It's just full of emotion, earnest prayer. And I think you understand that much to understand why we're suggesting you should supplicate all the time, all the time.

00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:52.860
And take for example, Christ Jesus said the perfect example for us here. And you'll notice in Hebrews chapter five.

00:11:52.860 --> 00:12:00.860
And how priceless his perfect example was, at least we try to reach for it.

00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:07.860
But not just you soon to be graduates, but all of us can benefit from this good council.

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:12.860
He was, he was chapter five in verse seven.

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:24.860
During his life on earth, Christ offered up supplications and also petitions with strong outcries and tears to the one who was able to save him out of death.

00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:28.860
And he was favorably heard for his godly fear.

00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:33.860
You'll notice though the supplications plural.

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:48.860
So certainly he's supplicated throughout his three and a half year ministry of it and only imagine the final weeks, days, hours, the tears, the supplication.

00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:57.860
So this is the example for us. And the closer we get to the end, Jehovah wants us to imitate his son.

00:12:57.860 --> 00:13:10.860
In fact, Jesus made it very clear how important this is and you're aware of it, but sometimes we get so busy with the things we're dealing with we can forget that notice what he commanded Luke.

00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:12.860
So find Luke.

00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:19.200
Now we're going to look at the 21st chapter. You'll quickly remember it.

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:22.200
Luke chapter 21.

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:30.200
Now here just to highlight a little bit before we read verse 36, you'll notice a verse 34.

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:37.200
These are the things we have to pay attention to to avoid being weighed down with over reading and heavy drinking and anxieties of life.

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:40.200
So it doesn't hit us like a snare.

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:57.200
Now notice verse 36, keep awake then all the time, making supplication that you may succeed in escaping all these things that must occur and in standing before the son of man.

00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:05.200
So this is what he said all the time, making supplication.

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:22.200
So obviously it's not going to be something if you're driving a car or you're going to stop and start supplicating on the road, but the spirit of his counsel is that you want to succeed.

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:32.200
Like I succeeded, you must supplicate all the time. It just has to be you can't let a day go by where you haven't had supplication.

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:36.200
The closer we get to the end, the more important that is.

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:44.200
A lot of us need to focus on supplicating because it's not what might occur.

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:48.200
It's what will occur.

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:50.200
See, this is a reality.

00:14:50.200 --> 00:15:02.200
So it's very obvious and it's understandable that we will supplicate when we are a loved one faces a crisis, something happens.

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:10.200
And then it's just natural to get that intense emotion in the prayer and there could well be tears, but it's intense.

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:18.200
It's just focused, just gripping you with the emotion as we face different things.

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:25.200
So that someone you may have a life threatening illness in the future, you'll start supplicating with that news.

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:37.200
You have a loved one, their life is threatened, there's going to be supplication, but just even though that's appropriate and Jehovah expects us to do that there.

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:43.200
Have you take back with your on your assignments, something that you must supplicate about too.

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:49.200
And I have to take the same counsel. It means a lot to Jehovah.

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:53.200
Very basic, but look at Matthew chapter 6.

00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:58.779
Matthew chapter 6.

00:15:58.779 --> 00:16:08.470
And this is where Jesus gave the example of prayer and it certainly extends to supplicating.

00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:13.470
You'll notice in verse 9 where he mentioned you must pray this way.

00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:19.470
Our Father in the heavens let your name be sanctified. Let your kingdom come.

00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:24.470
Let your will take place as in heaven, also on earth.

00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:27.470
So Jehovah's name.

00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:30.470
You look at this wicked world.

00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:35.470
It's getting worse, the Bible foretolder, from bad to worse.

00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:39.470
And it's just so reproachful to the holy name of God.

00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:45.470
Everybody is in the face of anything scriptural, and how terrible that is.

00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:52.470
Supplicating about your concern to Jehovah himself, how that bothers you, that'll touch him.

00:16:52.470 --> 00:17:00.470
And it's nice because it gets your mind off yourself, which is not always spiritually healthy.

00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:09.470
Focus on Jehovah's name because it's his name and the kingdom that's going to rid the whole world of all the problems anyway.

00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:19.470
So it's just something much to take with you to supplicate about Jehovah's name and removing the reproach and that his kingdom come.

00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:24.470
Do that often all the time, if you will.

00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:30.470
Now, just some final thoughts here and very familiar, Psalm, Psalm 83.

00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:36.470
So if you'll find some 83 here.

00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:46.980
And this connects with supplicating Jehovah to have his will done and his name to be vindicated.

00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:51.980
We say in English as well now, clear to the reproach.

00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:55.980
You feel the same way I do it. I'm way over here.

00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:58.980
It's disgusting.

00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:05.980
You got to keep up with some of the news, but it's almost like, let me stop.

00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:08.980
But you got to know a little something that's going on.

00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:12.980
And we have connection with our brothers from all different parts of the earth,

00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:14.980
things coming up all the time.

00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:19.980
So much to supplicate about and the kingdom's going to finally put it into all of it.

00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:24.980
Now, what I thought to appreciate, you look at the 83rd Psalm.

00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:29.980
Now, in context, the first five verses, this is interesting.

00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:32.980
It's about those who hate Jehovah.

00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:38.980
These arrogant enemies of Jehovah God hate him and hate his people.

00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:40.980
They're cunning. They're despicable.

00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:47.980
Now, it's quite fascinating that in verse five, see the B part of the verse,

00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:50.980
they have made an alliance against you.

00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:56.980
So this was an alliance of nations coming against Jehovah's name people.

00:18:56.980 --> 00:18:57.980
See an alliance.

00:18:57.980 --> 00:18:59.980
What's every mind job?

00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:03.980
So by focusing on supplicating all the time,

00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:08.980
you're really getting yourself ready for the great tribulation.

00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:12.980
Because we call it a coalition of nations,

00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:19.980
like Gog's attack, see, connects with what we see here happened in the past.

00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:28.980
And these beautiful thoughts here, notice verse 17 and verse 18 of the 83rd Psalm.

00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:30.980
And this is from our hearts.

00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:33.980
We want to supplicate this to our Father.

00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:37.980
May they be put to shame and be terrified forever.

00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:41.980
May they be disgraced and perish.

00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:46.980
May people know that you, whose name is Jehovah,

00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:51.980
you alone are the most high over all the earth.

00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:55.980
What a stirring supplication, see.

00:19:55.980 --> 00:20:01.980
So with whatever you face, you soon to be graduates in the future.

00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:04.980
Remember the scriptural advice.

00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:09.980
Supplicate all the time and you're sure to succeed.

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:17.640
Beautifully done.

00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:20.640
Thank you very much, brother Morris.

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:23.640
Now at the graduation of the first class of Gilead,

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:27.640
the next to speak was a responsible brother.

00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:30.640
And we have a responsible brother who is going to speak to us next.

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:34.640
Brother Herman Vanselm, he's a helper with the writing committee.

00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:39.640
And brother Vanselm is going to speak to us on the interesting theme,

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:47.809
see and be Jehovah's hand.

00:20:47.809 --> 00:20:51.809
Think for a moment of your congregation back home.

00:20:51.809 --> 00:20:55.809
Imagine that Jehovah observed there a dear elderly sister

00:20:55.809 --> 00:21:00.809
who has suffered one painful setback after another.

00:21:00.809 --> 00:21:03.809
As a result, she is heartbroken.

00:21:03.809 --> 00:21:07.809
She even feels that Jehovah doesn't love her anymore.

00:21:07.809 --> 00:21:09.809
But then through the working of his spirit,

00:21:09.809 --> 00:21:11.809
Jehovah makes you aware of her situation.

00:21:11.809 --> 00:21:14.809
You want to help the dear sister, but you wonder,

00:21:14.809 --> 00:21:18.809
can I show her that Jehovah is still reaching out to her?

00:21:18.809 --> 00:21:25.809
How can I help her to see Jehovah's supporting hand at work in her life?

00:21:25.809 --> 00:21:30.809
To answer, let us consider a few verses in the Bible book of Ruth,

00:21:30.809 --> 00:21:37.809
which relates the touching story of Naomi, Ruth, and Boas.

00:21:37.809 --> 00:21:41.809
As we remember, Naomi's husband died.

00:21:41.809 --> 00:21:47.809
Then her two sons got married, but sadly, both of them also died.

00:21:47.809 --> 00:21:52.809
Those blows caused Naomi to sing deeper and deeper into despair.

00:21:52.809 --> 00:21:56.809
She even felt that Jehovah had abandoned her.

00:21:56.809 --> 00:22:03.809
Note in chapter 1, verse 13, at the end of the verse, what Naomi said.

00:22:03.809 --> 00:22:08.809
The hand of Jehovah has turned against me.

00:22:09.809 --> 00:22:12.809
Verse 20, at the end of the verse,

00:22:12.809 --> 00:22:17.809
the Almighty has made my life very bitter for me.

00:22:17.809 --> 00:22:20.809
Verse 21, at the end of the verse,

00:22:20.809 --> 00:22:27.809
Jehovah who opposed me and the Almighty who caused me calamity.

00:22:27.809 --> 00:22:31.809
Now, these were strong statements, but of course none of them were true.

00:22:31.809 --> 00:22:34.809
Jehovah had not turned against her.

00:22:34.809 --> 00:22:37.809
Jehovah had not caused her calamity.

00:22:38.809 --> 00:22:42.809
So how did Jehovah react to Naomi's bitter words?

00:22:42.809 --> 00:22:46.809
Well, he did not send fire from heaven to punish her.

00:22:46.809 --> 00:22:49.809
He did not send a prophet to reproof her.

00:22:49.809 --> 00:22:55.809
Instead, he used Ruth and Boas to reach out to Naomi

00:22:55.809 --> 00:22:59.809
and pull her gently out of her despair.

00:22:59.809 --> 00:23:05.809
In a sense, Jehovah gave Ruth and Boas the privilege to serve as his hand.

00:23:05.809 --> 00:23:11.809
That is the means through which he would provide support to Naomi.

00:23:11.809 --> 00:23:20.809
In this class, we have 22 Ruth like sisters and 27 Boas like brothers.

00:23:20.809 --> 00:23:24.809
Also, there are thousands of Ruth and Boas in this audience.

00:23:24.809 --> 00:23:30.809
So how can we be Jehovah's hand and how can we help the Naomi's in our congregation

00:23:30.809 --> 00:23:34.809
to see Jehovah's hand at work in their life?

00:23:35.809 --> 00:23:41.809
To answer, we will consider five steps mentioned in the book of Ruth

00:23:41.809 --> 00:23:47.809
that we could follow to help our fellow worshipers who are in need.

00:23:47.809 --> 00:23:52.809
Step number one, have the right motivation.

00:23:52.809 --> 00:23:57.809
Since helping those in need takes great effort, we have to be motivated by love

00:23:57.809 --> 00:24:01.809
but it needs to be a special kind of love.

00:24:01.809 --> 00:24:02.809
What do we mean?

00:24:02.809 --> 00:24:06.809
Well, love is a bit like coffee.

00:24:06.809 --> 00:24:09.809
Coffee? In what way?

00:24:09.809 --> 00:24:11.809
Well, coffee comes in different types.

00:24:11.809 --> 00:24:17.809
It says cappuccino, caffé latte, caffé mocha.

00:24:17.809 --> 00:24:20.809
Similarly, love comes in different types.

00:24:20.809 --> 00:24:25.809
It says love for family, brotherly love, principled love.

00:24:25.809 --> 00:24:31.809
But the love, considered in the book of Ruth, is yet of a different type.

00:24:31.809 --> 00:24:35.809
What is it? It is mentioned in chapter 1, verse 8.

00:24:35.809 --> 00:24:40.119
Naomi said to both of her daughters-in-law,

00:24:40.119 --> 00:24:45.119
go, return, each of you to your mother's home,

00:24:45.119 --> 00:24:50.119
made Jehovah's show loyal love to you,

00:24:50.119 --> 00:24:56.119
just as you have shown it to the man who had died and to me.

00:24:56.119 --> 00:24:58.119
Loyal love.

00:24:58.119 --> 00:25:00.119
What kind of love is that?

00:25:00.119 --> 00:25:02.119
It's a very strong kind of love.

00:25:02.119 --> 00:25:05.119
It's a bit like a double espresso undiluted.

00:25:05.119 --> 00:25:10.119
It gives you a real boost that helps you to attach yourself to a brother in need

00:25:10.119 --> 00:25:14.119
and to cling to him until you have pulled him out of his despair.

00:25:14.119 --> 00:25:20.910
Now, that's the type of love we show to our brothers and sisters in need.

00:25:20.910 --> 00:25:22.910
Step number two.

00:25:22.910 --> 00:25:25.910
Be persistent.

00:25:25.910 --> 00:25:29.910
When Ruth offered her helping hand to Naomi,

00:25:29.910 --> 00:25:33.910
first refused to accept it.

00:25:33.910 --> 00:25:37.910
But Ruth motivated by Loyal love did not take no for an answer.

00:25:37.910 --> 00:25:39.910
What was the result?

00:25:39.910 --> 00:25:42.910
Chapter 1, verse 18.

00:25:42.910 --> 00:25:46.910
When Naomi saw that Ruth insisted on going with her,

00:25:46.910 --> 00:25:51.910
she stopped trying to convince her.

00:25:51.910 --> 00:25:53.910
Similarly today,

00:25:53.910 --> 00:25:57.910
a sister in despair may first refuse to accept our help,

00:25:57.910 --> 00:26:02.910
even so Loyal love will move us to cling to that sister,

00:26:02.910 --> 00:26:07.910
hoping that she will eventually accept our hand of friendship.

00:26:07.910 --> 00:26:11.160
Step number three.

00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:14.160
Don't take it personally.

00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:17.160
When Naomi and Ruth arrived in Bethlehem,

00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:19.160
Naomi met her former neighbors.

00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:21.160
What did she tell them?

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:24.160
Chapter 1, verse 21.

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:27.160
I was full when I went,

00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:36.750
but Jehovah made me return empty handed.

00:26:36.750 --> 00:26:38.750
What did she tell them?

00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:42.750
Now, put yourself in the place of Ruth.

00:26:42.750 --> 00:26:46.750
She had gone out of her way to help Naomi.

00:26:46.750 --> 00:26:48.750
She cried with her.

00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:50.750
She comforted her.

00:26:50.750 --> 00:26:53.750
She walked with her for days on end.

00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:58.750
And then, with Ruth standing next to her, Naomi said,

00:26:58.750 --> 00:27:01.750
I returned empty handed.

00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:06.750
She did not even acknowledge the presence of Ruth.

00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:10.750
How painful must that have been for our dear Ruth?

00:27:10.750 --> 00:27:14.750
Yet Ruth stuck with Naomi.

00:27:14.750 --> 00:27:17.750
Likewise today, a brother of a sister of her,

00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:20.750
because of her bitter feelings of despair,

00:27:20.750 --> 00:27:23.750
may speak to us or treat us in a hurtful way

00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:26.750
in spite of all our efforts to help her.

00:27:26.750 --> 00:27:30.750
But we do not try to make it take it personally.

00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:33.750
We stick with our sister and need and pray to Jehovah.

00:27:33.750 --> 00:27:36.750
Please open the sister's eye,

00:27:36.750 --> 00:27:40.750
let her see your outstretched hand.

00:27:40.750 --> 00:27:43.750
Step number four, give practical help.

00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:46.750
Ruth realized that Naomi's depression

00:27:46.750 --> 00:27:49.750
prevented her from taking the initiative.

00:27:49.750 --> 00:27:51.750
So, what did Ruth do?

00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:53.750
Chapter 2 verse 2.

00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:58.190
Ruth said to Naomi,

00:27:58.190 --> 00:28:01.190
let me go out pleased to the fields

00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:03.190
and glean among the ears of grain

00:28:03.190 --> 00:28:06.190
behind to ever look on me with favor.

00:28:06.190 --> 00:28:09.190
Today, we also realized that a brother in despair

00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:14.190
may lack the energy to take any initiative to help himself.

00:28:14.190 --> 00:28:18.190
So, loyal love for our brother moves us

00:28:18.190 --> 00:28:22.190
to take the first step in giving him practical help

00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:25.190
in and around his house.

00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:29.190
Step number five, get encouragement.

00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:32.190
Ruth badly needed encouragement

00:28:32.190 --> 00:28:35.190
and Jehovah moved Boas to give it to her.

00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:37.190
Look at Chapter 2 verse 12.

00:28:37.190 --> 00:28:40.190
Boas said to Ruth,

00:28:40.190 --> 00:28:45.190
may Jehovah reward you for what you have done

00:28:45.190 --> 00:28:48.190
and may there be a perfect wait for you

00:28:48.190 --> 00:28:50.190
from Jehovah the God of Israel

00:28:50.190 --> 00:28:55.190
under whose wings you have come to seek refuge.

00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:58.190
Now, after Ruth had been hearing

00:28:58.190 --> 00:29:01.190
negative talk for so long,

00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:05.190
those heartwarming words of Boas deeply touched her.

00:29:05.190 --> 00:29:07.190
In response in the middle of her sturting,

00:29:07.190 --> 00:29:09.190
we read that Ruth said to Boas,

00:29:09.190 --> 00:29:11.190
you have comforted me,

00:29:11.190 --> 00:29:15.190
and you have spoken reassuringly to your servant.

00:29:15.190 --> 00:29:18.190
The kind and timely words of Boas

00:29:18.190 --> 00:29:22.190
gave Ruth the strength he needed to carry on.

00:29:22.190 --> 00:29:25.190
Today, the kind words of a caring elder

00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:27.190
will have the same uplifting effect

00:29:27.190 --> 00:29:29.190
on those who give their all

00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:33.190
in helping brothers and sisters in need.

00:29:33.190 --> 00:29:35.190
If we follow these five steps,

00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:39.190
Jehovah may give us the privilege of being his hand.

00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:41.190
With what result?

00:29:41.190 --> 00:29:45.190
Consider what happened next to Naomi.

00:29:45.190 --> 00:29:48.190
The Bible account continues by telling that Boas provided

00:29:48.190 --> 00:29:52.190
a generous gift of food for Ruth and Naomi.

00:29:52.190 --> 00:29:57.190
What was Naomi's reaction to Boas' generosity?

00:29:57.190 --> 00:30:01.190
Chapter 2 verse 20.

00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:05.190
At that Naomi said to her daughter-in-law,

00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:08.190
may he be blessed by Jehovah

00:30:08.190 --> 00:30:11.190
who has not failed in his loyal love

00:30:11.190 --> 00:30:14.190
toward the living and the dead?

00:30:14.190 --> 00:30:17.190
Now, what a turning point this was for Naomi.

00:30:17.190 --> 00:30:19.190
Earlier, she had cried out in pain.

00:30:19.190 --> 00:30:22.190
Jehovah caused me calamity.

00:30:22.190 --> 00:30:24.190
But now she has claimed with joy,

00:30:24.190 --> 00:30:27.190
Jehovah has not failed in his loyal love.

00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:31.190
Finally, Naomi was able to connect the dots

00:30:31.190 --> 00:30:33.190
and realized that when Ruth had said to her,

00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:35.190
I will stick with you.

00:30:35.190 --> 00:30:36.190
I will gleam with you.

00:30:36.190 --> 00:30:39.190
Ruth was acting as Jehovah's hand.

00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:41.190
And then Boas had gone far beyond

00:30:41.190 --> 00:30:44.190
of what was required in cutting for Ruth and herself.

00:30:44.190 --> 00:30:47.190
Boas had acted in Jehovah's hand.

00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:51.190
Ah, now I understand Naomi must have thought.

00:30:51.190 --> 00:30:53.190
Jehovah never left me.

00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:55.190
He has been with me all the time.

00:30:55.190 --> 00:30:59.190
I'm so grateful to Ruth and Boas

00:30:59.190 --> 00:31:04.190
that they helped me to see Jehovah's supporting hands.

00:31:04.190 --> 00:31:08.190
No doubt, all three of them rejoiced

00:31:08.190 --> 00:31:13.190
over the decisive turning point they had reached.

00:31:13.190 --> 00:31:17.190
In summary, what gave Ruth and Boas the strength

00:31:17.190 --> 00:31:20.190
to pull Naomi out of her despair?

00:31:20.190 --> 00:31:24.190
Loyal love, a strong kind of love that we give

00:31:24.190 --> 00:31:26.190
not to people in general,

00:31:26.190 --> 00:31:28.190
but to our brothers and sisters,

00:31:28.190 --> 00:31:31.190
especially those who are the need.

00:31:31.190 --> 00:31:33.190
What was the result?

00:31:33.190 --> 00:31:37.190
Boas and Ruth had the joy of seeing

00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:41.190
how Naomi regained her spiritual balance.

00:31:41.190 --> 00:31:45.190
Today, we may experience the same deep joy

00:31:45.190 --> 00:31:48.190
when we are able to help our brothers and sisters

00:31:48.190 --> 00:31:50.190
in need to see Jehovah's hand

00:31:50.190 --> 00:31:55.190
and thus regain their spiritual strength.

00:31:55.190 --> 00:31:59.190
Therefore, our dear Ruth like sisters

00:31:59.190 --> 00:32:05.190
and Boas like brothers of class 144.

00:32:05.190 --> 00:32:08.190
It is our heartfelt prayer

00:32:08.190 --> 00:32:11.190
that the precious education that you receive

00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:16.190
that Gilead may help you more than ever to see

00:32:16.190 --> 00:32:20.190
and to be Jehovah's hand.

00:32:20.190 --> 00:32:32.910
Well, that was better than a double espresso, wasn't it?

00:32:32.910 --> 00:32:34.910
Now we're going to have a helper

00:32:34.910 --> 00:32:37.910
from the teaching committee to talk to us

00:32:37.910 --> 00:32:39.910
and he has the interesting theme

00:32:39.910 --> 00:32:43.910
be the keel K-E-E-L.

00:32:43.910 --> 00:32:46.910
So we'll listen with interest.

00:32:46.910 --> 00:32:52.410
Like a sailboat in the open sea,

00:32:52.410 --> 00:32:55.410
you could be sailing along and enjoying a life,

00:32:55.410 --> 00:32:57.410
enjoying your view,

00:32:57.410 --> 00:32:59.410
but then suddenly and unexpectedly,

00:32:59.410 --> 00:33:01.410
a turbulent storm,

00:33:01.410 --> 00:33:05.410
a trial some situation could be confronting you.

00:33:05.410 --> 00:33:09.410
That could really rock your boat.

00:33:09.410 --> 00:33:12.410
How true are the words found in the watchtower

00:33:12.410 --> 00:33:16.410
of March 1st, 1896 issue

00:33:16.410 --> 00:33:18.410
where it stated,

00:33:18.410 --> 00:33:21.410
the Christian course of self-sacrifice

00:33:21.410 --> 00:33:23.410
cannot be one of ease

00:33:23.410 --> 00:33:26.410
and continuous smooth sailing and peace.

00:33:26.410 --> 00:33:29.410
There may be a calm now and then,

00:33:29.410 --> 00:33:33.410
but storms and battles are the rule.

00:33:33.410 --> 00:33:35.410
Now, if that was the case,

00:33:35.410 --> 00:33:37.410
122 years ago,

00:33:37.410 --> 00:33:39.410
maybe before all of us were alive,

00:33:39.410 --> 00:33:42.410
how much more so is that the rule

00:33:42.410 --> 00:33:45.410
or the case today?

00:33:45.410 --> 00:33:48.410
Life and Satan's system is anything

00:33:48.410 --> 00:33:50.410
but smooth sailing.

00:33:50.410 --> 00:33:53.410
How can you students help others

00:33:53.410 --> 00:33:55.410
endure present storms

00:33:55.410 --> 00:33:58.410
and prepare them for future tests,

00:33:58.410 --> 00:34:00.410
future storms?

00:34:00.410 --> 00:34:02.410
Be the keel.

00:34:02.410 --> 00:34:04.410
What does that mean?

00:34:04.410 --> 00:34:06.410
The keel is a heavily weighted fin

00:34:06.410 --> 00:34:09.409
attached to the bottom of the sailboat.

00:34:09.409 --> 00:34:12.409
So when strong gusting winds fill the sail

00:34:12.409 --> 00:34:14.409
and the vessel leans on its side,

00:34:14.409 --> 00:34:17.409
the keel serves as the ballast,

00:34:17.409 --> 00:34:18.409
the counterweight.

00:34:18.409 --> 00:34:21.409
It provides stability.

00:34:21.409 --> 00:34:24.409
It prevents the sailboat from blowing sideways,

00:34:24.409 --> 00:34:29.409
from capsizing or keeling over.

00:34:29.409 --> 00:34:31.409
Our brothers and sisters,

00:34:31.409 --> 00:34:32.409
now more than ever,

00:34:32.409 --> 00:34:34.409
need to be strengthened.

00:34:34.409 --> 00:34:36.409
They need to be stabilized,

00:34:36.409 --> 00:34:39.409
so they can face storms of anxiety,

00:34:39.409 --> 00:34:41.409
natural disasters,

00:34:41.409 --> 00:34:45.409
and wave after wave of ridicule and persecution.

00:34:45.409 --> 00:34:49.409
That's the focus of Gilead School.

00:34:49.409 --> 00:34:52.409
To strengthen and stabilize qualified men and women,

00:34:52.409 --> 00:34:54.409
like you,

00:34:54.409 --> 00:34:57.409
so that you in turn can strengthen and stabilize

00:34:57.409 --> 00:35:00.409
the Hauva's organization.

00:35:00.409 --> 00:35:02.409
Empowered with Jehovah's spirit,

00:35:02.409 --> 00:35:05.409
you can be like those strengthening aids

00:35:05.409 --> 00:35:07.409
in the first century,

00:35:07.409 --> 00:35:10.409
who prove to be someone who could stabilize

00:35:10.409 --> 00:35:12.409
their brothers and sisters.

00:35:12.409 --> 00:35:14.409
And there are many examples,

00:35:14.409 --> 00:35:16.409
but let's look at Acts chapter 18,

00:35:16.409 --> 00:35:17.409
verse 24,

00:35:17.409 --> 00:35:20.409
and let's see why the man Apollos

00:35:20.409 --> 00:35:23.409
is someone who we want to follow.

00:35:23.409 --> 00:35:25.409
There in Acts chapter 18,

00:35:25.409 --> 00:35:27.409
let's read together,

00:35:27.409 --> 00:35:29.409
verse 24.

00:35:29.409 --> 00:35:31.409
And there it reads,

00:35:31.409 --> 00:35:33.409
now a Jew named Apollos,

00:35:33.409 --> 00:35:35.409
a native of Alexandria,

00:35:35.409 --> 00:35:37.409
arrived in Ephesus,

00:35:37.409 --> 00:35:39.409
and notice he was an eloquent man

00:35:39.409 --> 00:35:41.409
who was well versed in the scriptures.

00:35:41.409 --> 00:35:43.409
This man had been instructed

00:35:43.409 --> 00:35:45.409
in the way of Jehovah,

00:35:45.409 --> 00:35:47.409
and notice he was a glow with the spirit,

00:35:47.409 --> 00:35:49.409
which caused him to speak

00:35:49.409 --> 00:35:51.409
and teach accurately

00:35:51.409 --> 00:35:53.409
about the things of Jesus.

00:35:53.409 --> 00:35:56.409
But he was equated only with the baptism of John.

00:35:56.409 --> 00:35:59.409
He began to speak boldly in the synagogue,

00:35:59.409 --> 00:36:02.409
and when Priscilla and Aquila heard him,

00:36:02.409 --> 00:36:04.409
what do they do?

00:36:04.409 --> 00:36:06.409
They took him into their company

00:36:06.409 --> 00:36:08.409
and explained the way of God

00:36:08.409 --> 00:36:10.409
more accurately to him.

00:36:10.409 --> 00:36:13.409
But what outstanding qualities Apollos had,

00:36:13.409 --> 00:36:17.409
qualities that you students have as well.

00:36:17.409 --> 00:36:20.409
Now Apollos had his strengths,

00:36:20.409 --> 00:36:22.409
but like all of us,

00:36:22.409 --> 00:36:24.409
he also had his weaknesses,

00:36:24.409 --> 00:36:27.409
so that he needed to humbly get more help,

00:36:27.409 --> 00:36:29.409
more understanding.

00:36:29.409 --> 00:36:31.409
So how thankful we are,

00:36:31.409 --> 00:36:32.409
and he was,

00:36:32.409 --> 00:36:36.409
that Aquila and Priscilla fill in the gaps,

00:36:36.409 --> 00:36:40.409
help him to appreciate the deeper things of Jehovah,

00:36:40.409 --> 00:36:43.409
so he could speak more accurately.

00:36:43.409 --> 00:36:45.409
Yes, this well-grounded,

00:36:45.409 --> 00:36:47.409
spiritually mature couple

00:36:47.409 --> 00:36:51.409
also helped Apollos learn life lessons,

00:36:51.409 --> 00:36:53.409
like what?

00:36:53.409 --> 00:36:55.409
Working as his Heam,

00:36:55.409 --> 00:36:57.409
working in unity.

00:36:57.409 --> 00:36:59.409
They also taught him life lessons

00:36:59.409 --> 00:37:01.409
about going the extra mile,

00:37:01.409 --> 00:37:03.409
helping those who needed help spiritually,

00:37:03.409 --> 00:37:06.409
as well as materially.

00:37:06.409 --> 00:37:08.409
What it means to be generous,

00:37:08.409 --> 00:37:10.409
to be hospitable,

00:37:10.409 --> 00:37:14.409
but also the key that humility is needed

00:37:14.409 --> 00:37:17.409
in order to support others,

00:37:17.409 --> 00:37:20.409
so we're content in our assignment.

00:37:20.409 --> 00:37:22.409
Like Apollos,

00:37:22.409 --> 00:37:25.409
we've got the invitation to come to Gillian

00:37:25.409 --> 00:37:27.409
to receive extra schooling,

00:37:27.409 --> 00:37:29.409
to have a deeper understanding

00:37:29.409 --> 00:37:31.409
of God's word of the Bible.

00:37:31.409 --> 00:37:32.409
And along the way,

00:37:32.409 --> 00:37:34.409
you learn vital life lessons

00:37:34.409 --> 00:37:36.409
from this Bethel family

00:37:36.409 --> 00:37:38.409
who are supporting you.

00:37:38.409 --> 00:37:40.409
You learn what it meant to go the extra mile,

00:37:40.409 --> 00:37:41.409
to be hospitable,

00:37:41.409 --> 00:37:43.409
to be generous, kind,

00:37:43.409 --> 00:37:45.409
and patient.

00:37:45.409 --> 00:37:48.409
You also learn what it means to be a giver

00:37:48.409 --> 00:37:51.409
and not simply a taker.

00:37:51.409 --> 00:37:53.409
And as I assume, graduate,

00:37:53.409 --> 00:37:55.409
you will have a diploma in your hand.

00:37:55.409 --> 00:37:56.409
Is that it?

00:37:56.409 --> 00:37:57.409
You walk away?

00:37:57.409 --> 00:37:59.409
That's all for your instruction?

00:37:59.409 --> 00:38:00.409
Of course not.

00:38:00.409 --> 00:38:02.409
We know that Jehovah promises

00:38:02.409 --> 00:38:04.409
that he will continue

00:38:04.409 --> 00:38:06.409
to give you instruction.

00:38:06.409 --> 00:38:08.409
In fact, at First Peter,

00:38:08.409 --> 00:38:11.409
chapter 5, notice verse 10.

00:38:11.409 --> 00:38:15.940
Therein first Peter 5 verse 10,

00:38:15.940 --> 00:38:20.940
Jehovah promises that he will

00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:22.980
he finish your training.

00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:25.579
It goes on to say that his continued training

00:38:25.579 --> 00:38:29.659
will make you firm, it will make you strong,

00:38:29.659 --> 00:38:32.539
and he will firmly ground you.

00:38:32.539 --> 00:38:35.980
So just as a heel is filled with heavy weight

00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:40.099
to keep the boat stable and upright,

00:38:40.099 --> 00:38:42.460
so too Jehovah promises to give you

00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:46.300
his powerful Holy Spirit so that you can be strengthened

00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:50.019
and stabilized and help others to do the same,

00:38:50.019 --> 00:38:52.380
to be firmly grounded.

00:38:52.380 --> 00:38:54.500
Now, because the Paulus was humble

00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:56.019
and he accepted the help,

00:38:56.019 --> 00:38:59.460
he put himself in a position to be used

00:38:59.460 --> 00:39:03.219
mightily by Jehovah and by his organization.

00:39:03.219 --> 00:39:07.780
Now, what did he do to greatly help the congregations back then?

00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:10.940
Notice Acts chapter 18 and verse 27.

00:39:12.019 --> 00:39:16.059
There Acts 18 and verse 27,

00:39:16.059 --> 00:39:20.139
Paulus not only helped the congregation in Achaea,

00:39:20.139 --> 00:39:24.099
it says that he greatly helped them.

00:39:25.139 --> 00:39:28.139
And it went on to say in another translation of this verse,

00:39:28.139 --> 00:39:31.539
he powerfully reinforced them.

00:39:31.539 --> 00:39:35.059
So he was really someone who took the training

00:39:35.059 --> 00:39:37.460
and really made it happen.

00:39:37.460 --> 00:39:39.059
In fact, if you look at verse 28,

00:39:39.059 --> 00:39:42.179
he said an example of someone who should be

00:39:42.179 --> 00:39:43.539
a zealous in the ministry.

00:39:43.579 --> 00:39:46.699
He used the scriptures that he had at the time

00:39:46.699 --> 00:39:49.219
and he used these as his authority.

00:39:49.219 --> 00:39:50.579
And how did he speak?

00:39:50.579 --> 00:39:54.340
Verse 28 says, with great intensity.

00:39:54.340 --> 00:39:57.300
So we could say that basically,

00:39:57.300 --> 00:40:00.659
a Paulus was a keel with zeal.

00:40:02.179 --> 00:40:04.420
And we look forward to seeing how you will use

00:40:04.420 --> 00:40:07.539
your Gilead training to greatly help others

00:40:07.539 --> 00:40:11.380
in your assignments and doing so with great intensity.

00:40:12.340 --> 00:40:13.739
Now, when you look at a sailboat,

00:40:13.739 --> 00:40:16.980
what's the first thing that you normally see?

00:40:16.980 --> 00:40:18.500
Isn't it the sail?

00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:19.340
Why?

00:40:19.340 --> 00:40:22.460
Because it's the most prominent, outstanding thing

00:40:22.460 --> 00:40:24.300
on a sailboat.

00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:27.059
Now the keel, on the other hand, is unseen.

00:40:27.059 --> 00:40:30.340
It's below the water, below the boat, but there it is.

00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:31.820
It's doing its job.

00:40:31.820 --> 00:40:33.860
It's keeping that sailboat upright,

00:40:33.860 --> 00:40:36.179
support it and stabilized.

00:40:37.019 --> 00:40:40.579
Now, you could hardly imagine a Paulus thinking to himself,

00:40:40.579 --> 00:40:43.980
I know that my assignment as a keel, as a support,

00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:45.980
as a stabilizer is important,

00:40:45.980 --> 00:40:49.860
but I don't think I'm being tapped into my true potential.

00:40:49.860 --> 00:40:52.380
I don't think the brothers can really see me down here

00:40:52.380 --> 00:40:54.739
doing all that I'm supposed to do.

00:40:54.739 --> 00:40:57.780
Yes, I know that I'm not an apostle.

00:40:57.780 --> 00:41:00.420
I'm not used to right inspired letters,

00:41:00.420 --> 00:41:04.139
although I would be a logical choice.

00:41:04.139 --> 00:41:07.940
If only, if only, I could have a more elevated,

00:41:07.940 --> 00:41:11.460
a higher position, maybe like the sail.

00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:14.260
If I was the sail, everyone could see me,

00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:16.019
and I could get more airtime.

00:41:16.820 --> 00:41:19.659
And then everyone could hear me and my words

00:41:19.659 --> 00:41:21.820
that were so eloquent.

00:41:21.820 --> 00:41:23.539
Well, we know that that's ridiculous.

00:41:23.539 --> 00:41:26.860
He never thought that and he never acted that way

00:41:26.860 --> 00:41:28.300
towards others.

00:41:28.300 --> 00:41:30.900
The Bible only reveals just a fraction

00:41:30.900 --> 00:41:34.260
of all that Apollo said and that he did.

00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:36.860
But what we do know, that the most outstanding,

00:41:36.860 --> 00:41:39.380
the most prominent thing about Apollo's,

00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:41.260
was his humility.

00:41:41.260 --> 00:41:45.139
He was willing, humble, to do anything,

00:41:45.139 --> 00:41:48.579
be sent wherever he was sent to go.

00:41:48.579 --> 00:41:53.340
He never allowed his strength to become weaknesses.

00:41:53.340 --> 00:41:56.780
Likewise, much of what you, Gilead students,

00:41:56.780 --> 00:42:00.340
will do in the future, will be unseen by others.

00:42:00.340 --> 00:42:03.860
But you know that Jehovah sees everything you do

00:42:03.860 --> 00:42:06.820
and all the work and a stabilizing you do

00:42:06.820 --> 00:42:09.579
in behalf of his precious sheep.

00:42:09.579 --> 00:42:13.059
You students have many gifts, many strengths,

00:42:13.059 --> 00:42:17.940
many abilities, but your humility must exceed

00:42:17.940 --> 00:42:20.500
any gifts or strengths that you have.

00:42:20.500 --> 00:42:25.019
Never allow your strengths to become your weakness.

00:42:25.019 --> 00:42:30.019
Remember, ability without humility is a liability.

00:42:31.699 --> 00:42:36.179
But ability with humility is stability

00:42:36.179 --> 00:42:39.380
and that's the key to a keel.

00:42:39.420 --> 00:42:41.539
And no doubt when you look back at your life,

00:42:41.539 --> 00:42:45.300
there were many that served as a keel for you.

00:42:45.300 --> 00:42:47.980
They were the ones who stabilized you, balanced you

00:42:47.980 --> 00:42:49.659
when you needed it most.

00:42:49.659 --> 00:42:51.340
When you were going through turbulent storms

00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:54.059
in your life, they were there for you.

00:42:54.059 --> 00:42:56.059
Who was your Apollo's?

00:42:56.059 --> 00:42:58.860
Who was your Aquila, your Priscilla?

00:42:58.860 --> 00:43:02.500
Remember all that they said and did for you.

00:43:02.500 --> 00:43:06.019
And remember that you can be that person for someone else.

00:43:06.019 --> 00:43:09.019
They can help you to be balanced, stable,

00:43:09.059 --> 00:43:10.420
even keeled.

00:43:11.860 --> 00:43:13.460
Now it's your turn.

00:43:13.460 --> 00:43:16.619
Take your Gilead training and greatly help

00:43:16.619 --> 00:43:18.500
your brothers and sisters.

00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:22.260
Love them, support them, strengthen them,

00:43:22.260 --> 00:43:33.090
stabilize them, be the keel.

00:43:33.090 --> 00:43:34.570
By the way, I forgot to mention

00:43:34.570 --> 00:43:37.170
that was Ron Curson in case you didn't know.

00:43:38.130 --> 00:43:41.650
So we appreciate that spiritual ceiling lesson.

00:43:42.449 --> 00:43:47.210
Now at the first graduation in 1943,

00:43:47.210 --> 00:43:49.769
there were four Gilead instructors

00:43:49.769 --> 00:43:52.969
who gave parting words to the class.

00:43:53.969 --> 00:43:56.690
Three of them are going to be three instructors,

00:43:56.690 --> 00:43:58.570
not the original instructors.

00:43:59.530 --> 00:44:03.250
Three instructors are going to be on the program today.

00:44:03.250 --> 00:44:06.489
And so the first one is brother Jim Coffin

00:44:06.489 --> 00:44:08.690
and he's going to speak on the subject,

00:44:08.730 --> 00:44:13.820
pause and reset.

00:44:13.820 --> 00:44:18.219
There are two things that I know about you

00:44:18.219 --> 00:44:23.300
and two things that you know about me.

00:44:23.300 --> 00:44:27.699
The first is we want to serve Jehovah

00:44:27.699 --> 00:44:29.940
and we want to do so acceptably.

00:44:29.940 --> 00:44:33.699
And the second is we want to be happy, would you agree?

00:44:34.659 --> 00:44:38.260
Now to the first point, there's not much of a problem

00:44:38.260 --> 00:44:41.739
because you've had five months of study now,

00:44:41.860 --> 00:44:43.460
you've been through the Bible,

00:44:43.460 --> 00:44:46.219
you know what Jehovah expects what he wants

00:44:46.219 --> 00:44:48.619
and you're prepared to do it.

00:44:48.619 --> 00:44:50.460
But now as to the second point,

00:44:50.460 --> 00:44:53.099
that can be a little bit more challenging.

00:44:53.099 --> 00:44:55.139
And why do I say that?

00:44:55.139 --> 00:44:56.940
Well, happiness can be tricky.

00:44:58.059 --> 00:45:01.460
We all know people that by all standards

00:45:01.460 --> 00:45:05.619
should seem to be happy, but they're not.

00:45:05.619 --> 00:45:07.300
On the other hand, we know people

00:45:07.300 --> 00:45:11.500
who face many, many difficult challenges every day,

00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:17.340
but they just seem to radiate happiness.

00:45:17.340 --> 00:45:21.579
We quickly realize that happiness is not dependent

00:45:21.579 --> 00:45:26.139
on things, on circumstances, or even on people.

00:45:26.139 --> 00:45:27.659
Why is that?

00:45:27.659 --> 00:45:31.619
It's because true happiness is not an end goal.

00:45:31.619 --> 00:45:36.619
It is a byproduct, but a byproduct of what?

00:45:36.820 --> 00:45:41.019
Well, the answer to that question lies back in time.

00:45:41.019 --> 00:45:42.739
Open your Bibles if you would

00:45:42.739 --> 00:45:46.809
to do to run me chapter 16.

00:45:46.809 --> 00:45:50.889
And here discussing one of the three annual festivals

00:45:50.889 --> 00:45:54.610
that Jehovah required the Israelites to attend.

00:45:54.610 --> 00:45:58.369
In verse 15, he gave these words.

00:45:59.289 --> 00:46:02.170
He said, seven days you will celebrate the festival

00:46:02.170 --> 00:46:05.849
to Jehovah your God and the place that Jehovah chooses.

00:46:05.849 --> 00:46:09.010
For Jehovah your God will bless all your produce

00:46:09.010 --> 00:46:10.769
and all that you do.

00:46:10.769 --> 00:46:15.369
And you will become nothing but joyful.

00:46:15.369 --> 00:46:18.489
Now, did you notice Jehovah's words there?

00:46:18.489 --> 00:46:23.050
You will become nothing but joyful.

00:46:23.050 --> 00:46:27.329
You see, being joyful as a worshiper of Jehovah

00:46:27.329 --> 00:46:29.010
was not an option.

00:46:29.010 --> 00:46:33.369
He actually made it an act of worship.

00:46:33.369 --> 00:46:35.050
But why?

00:46:35.050 --> 00:46:38.210
It's because imperfect humans can lose their appreciation

00:46:38.250 --> 00:46:41.730
for things that become a routine part of life

00:46:41.730 --> 00:46:44.969
even if these things are a reflection

00:46:44.969 --> 00:46:46.849
of Jehovah's loving concern.

00:46:47.769 --> 00:46:49.809
So what was it about these festivals

00:46:49.809 --> 00:46:51.570
who would cause all who attended them

00:46:51.570 --> 00:46:54.090
to become nothing but joyful?

00:46:55.010 --> 00:46:57.570
Well, each festival was to be a time

00:46:57.570 --> 00:47:01.090
when the Israelites stopped what they were doing.

00:47:01.090 --> 00:47:04.130
In other words, they would pause.

00:47:04.130 --> 00:47:06.889
They would go up to Jerusalem

00:47:06.889 --> 00:47:09.809
to reflect on the blessings that they had received

00:47:09.809 --> 00:47:13.130
from Jehovah and that they were receiving.

00:47:13.130 --> 00:47:15.730
In other words, they would reset.

00:47:16.730 --> 00:47:21.530
What effect did this pause and reset have on the Israelites?

00:47:21.530 --> 00:47:24.170
One word, gratitude.

00:47:25.130 --> 00:47:27.449
You know what happens when we feel gratitude?

00:47:28.449 --> 00:47:31.289
Happiness always follows.

00:47:31.289 --> 00:47:32.650
You remember Jehovah's words,

00:47:32.650 --> 00:47:35.489
you will become nothing but joyful.

00:47:35.489 --> 00:47:39.769
And Jehovah knows that happiness is a byproduct of gratitude.

00:47:40.690 --> 00:47:44.050
Now, how does this ancient example help us today?

00:47:45.329 --> 00:47:49.929
Well, life in this old system is filled with hardships.

00:47:49.929 --> 00:47:52.809
A head of you will be challenges,

00:47:52.809 --> 00:47:56.610
uncertainties, time and unforeseen occurrence.

00:47:56.610 --> 00:47:58.690
And really, that's true for all of us.

00:47:59.650 --> 00:48:02.650
Jehovah knows this, but he also knows

00:48:02.730 --> 00:48:06.449
that it is precisely during times of crisis

00:48:06.449 --> 00:48:11.449
that we have the most gained by having a grateful perspective.

00:48:12.530 --> 00:48:15.570
Gratitude reminds us that our Creator loves us

00:48:15.570 --> 00:48:17.570
and they cares about us.

00:48:17.570 --> 00:48:21.409
It reminds us that God's goodness exists

00:48:21.409 --> 00:48:24.369
even in the worst that life has to offer.

00:48:25.369 --> 00:48:27.690
Gratitude doesn't cure suffering,

00:48:27.690 --> 00:48:30.050
but it has a power to heal.

00:48:30.090 --> 00:48:33.090
Gratitude doesn't erase despair,

00:48:33.090 --> 00:48:36.730
but it has the power to radiate hope.

00:48:36.730 --> 00:48:41.530
Gratitude nullifies negativity.

00:48:41.530 --> 00:48:46.530
The joy of Jehovah becomes our stronghold, but it's up to us.

00:48:47.730 --> 00:48:50.329
Because gratitude is more than just a feeling

00:48:50.329 --> 00:48:51.929
for others and sisters.

00:48:51.929 --> 00:48:56.449
It's a mindset, it's a disposition, and it's choice.

00:48:57.610 --> 00:48:59.929
Why do we say a choice?

00:48:59.929 --> 00:49:03.489
It's because we can make a conscious decision

00:49:03.489 --> 00:49:06.769
to see blessings instead of curses.

00:49:06.769 --> 00:49:09.050
Jehovah is called the happy God

00:49:09.050 --> 00:49:13.530
and he gives us the recipe to be happy too.

00:49:13.530 --> 00:49:18.530
That recipe is found in part in Psalm 143.

00:49:18.690 --> 00:49:19.650
Let's turn there.

00:49:20.809 --> 00:49:23.969
Psalm 143, verse five,

00:49:24.889 --> 00:49:29.210
David, the Psalmist said this.

00:49:29.210 --> 00:49:31.690
He said, I remember the days of old.

00:49:31.690 --> 00:49:34.730
I meditate on all your activity.

00:49:34.730 --> 00:49:38.130
I eagerly ponder over the works of your hands.

00:49:39.409 --> 00:49:41.170
What's the point?

00:49:41.170 --> 00:49:44.329
The Psalmist is basically telling us

00:49:44.329 --> 00:49:46.690
that from time to time, we have to stop

00:49:46.690 --> 00:49:49.250
and press the pause button.

00:49:49.250 --> 00:49:51.730
We need to take time to look around.

00:49:51.730 --> 00:49:55.010
Jehovah has bejeweled our world

00:49:55.010 --> 00:49:58.889
with daily reminders of his goodness, his power,

00:49:58.889 --> 00:50:02.010
that most of all his love for us.

00:50:02.010 --> 00:50:06.170
All we have to do is take the time to look.

00:50:07.769 --> 00:50:11.530
We are immersed in the goodness of God.

00:50:11.530 --> 00:50:13.090
So pause from time to time.

00:50:13.090 --> 00:50:16.849
Take a moment to appreciate what God is giving you each day.

00:50:17.889 --> 00:50:22.250
Contemplate the abundance and the diversity of life.

00:50:23.690 --> 00:50:28.690
Ponder, muse, meditate on all the works of the true God.

00:50:29.090 --> 00:50:34.429
Drink in the awesomeness of the universe on the starry night.

00:50:34.429 --> 00:50:39.429
No two sunrises and no two sunsets are ever exactly alike.

00:50:42.789 --> 00:50:44.230
Look up to the clouds.

00:50:45.230 --> 00:50:47.550
What you see is ever changing.

00:50:47.550 --> 00:50:49.750
There's nothing exactly like it before

00:50:49.750 --> 00:50:51.670
nor will there ever be again.

00:50:52.829 --> 00:50:57.030
The feeling you will experience is a refreshment of the soul.

00:50:57.030 --> 00:50:59.110
It is a reset.

00:50:59.150 --> 00:51:03.070
I see only light, ears hear only sound,

00:51:03.070 --> 00:51:06.110
but a grateful heart perceives meaning.

00:51:06.110 --> 00:51:09.710
We perceive that Jehovah created all these things

00:51:10.829 --> 00:51:12.630
as a gift for us.

00:51:13.909 --> 00:51:15.110
That's right.

00:51:15.110 --> 00:51:18.789
Each day was to be a very special gift,

00:51:18.789 --> 00:51:20.989
unique unto itself.

00:51:20.989 --> 00:51:22.309
Why?

00:51:22.309 --> 00:51:25.309
To make endless life not just special,

00:51:25.309 --> 00:51:29.150
but amazing, wondrous, and always a joy.

00:51:30.789 --> 00:51:35.789
Connecting with Jehovah's creation helps to discharge anxiety.

00:51:36.590 --> 00:51:39.349
It shifts our attention to something safe,

00:51:39.349 --> 00:51:42.949
something enduring, something outside ourselves.

00:51:44.070 --> 00:51:46.670
It helps us to accept life's uncertainties

00:51:46.670 --> 00:51:51.030
by reassuring us that we are part of something larger,

00:51:51.030 --> 00:51:56.030
something everlasting, something immensely important.

00:51:56.030 --> 00:52:01.989
Yes, we are a part of God's purpose.

00:52:01.989 --> 00:52:06.989
Gratitude is important, not only because it helps us feel good,

00:52:07.389 --> 00:52:10.909
but because it inspires us to do good.

00:52:12.070 --> 00:52:14.909
A grateful spirit will make you more loving,

00:52:14.909 --> 00:52:20.739
more forgiving, more feeling, more thoughtful.

00:52:20.739 --> 00:52:25.739
Thankfulness is a soil in which joy thrives.

00:52:26.059 --> 00:52:30.539
So open your hearts to the blessings around you.

00:52:30.539 --> 00:52:34.099
Let gratefulness flow from the inside out to others.

00:52:35.420 --> 00:52:37.860
You too will become nothing but joyful,

00:52:37.860 --> 00:52:41.860
and that joy will show in your smile, in your eyes,

00:52:41.860 --> 00:52:45.059
and your touch, and in your words.

00:52:45.059 --> 00:52:46.300
Why?

00:52:46.300 --> 00:52:49.739
Because gratitude is the ability to experience life,

00:52:49.739 --> 00:52:52.820
not as a test, but as a gift.

00:52:52.820 --> 00:52:56.500
It will impact every relationship that you have,

00:52:56.500 --> 00:53:01.500
your family, your marriage, your work, even your ministry.

00:53:02.699 --> 00:53:04.460
You'll be in a much better position

00:53:04.460 --> 00:53:07.780
to make a real difference in the lives of others.

00:53:07.780 --> 00:53:12.780
It will liberate you from the prison of self-preoccupation,

00:53:12.980 --> 00:53:15.460
and it will replace a critical spirit

00:53:15.460 --> 00:53:17.460
with a sense of appreciation.

00:53:18.460 --> 00:53:23.460
So pause regularly to reflect on what you hope has given you.

00:53:25.460 --> 00:53:28.500
Give the digital world a break.

00:53:29.659 --> 00:53:34.659
Take a walk outside, and don't just look, pause and perceive.

00:53:36.460 --> 00:53:39.980
Try to count all the blessings that you receive each day,

00:53:39.980 --> 00:53:43.059
and you will find it easier to cope with the trials

00:53:43.059 --> 00:53:45.340
and the stresses of life.

00:53:45.340 --> 00:53:49.179
We are never more than one grateful thought away

00:53:49.179 --> 00:53:53.380
from increased peace of mind and greater peace of heart.

00:53:53.380 --> 00:54:04.909
Just remember, pause and reflect.

00:54:04.909 --> 00:54:08.230
I think we all agree that we needed that.

00:54:08.230 --> 00:54:11.389
We appreciate that effective presentation.

00:54:11.389 --> 00:54:14.429
Now the second of our instructors to speak today

00:54:14.429 --> 00:54:18.550
is Brother Mark Numer, and he's going to talk on the subject

00:54:18.550 --> 00:54:23.019
the unsung legacy.

00:54:23.019 --> 00:54:28.019
The word carries the thought of passing on something

00:54:30.340 --> 00:54:33.860
of value to those that come after you.

00:54:34.780 --> 00:54:38.260
But what is an unsung legacy?

00:54:39.380 --> 00:54:41.260
It's a legacy that's unknown.

00:54:42.219 --> 00:54:45.820
So if no one knows about you,

00:54:45.820 --> 00:54:49.300
how can you pass on anything of value to them?

00:54:50.300 --> 00:54:55.300
Can you influence others if your work is behind the scenes?

00:54:57.300 --> 00:54:59.900
Yes, the Kenites did.

00:55:00.900 --> 00:55:03.900
They're not included in the cloud of witnesses

00:55:03.900 --> 00:55:06.099
at Hebrews chapter 11.

00:55:06.900 --> 00:55:11.500
Yet the value of their faith, what they've passed on to you,

00:55:11.500 --> 00:55:13.500
is worth meditating on.

00:55:14.699 --> 00:55:16.900
They never enjoyed the spotlight.

00:55:17.900 --> 00:55:22.900
Yet in Jehovah's eyes, they are so precious and unforgettable.

00:55:23.900 --> 00:55:26.900
Let's do some digging and on earth,

00:55:26.900 --> 00:55:29.900
the legacy of the Kenites.

00:55:29.900 --> 00:55:32.900
And we want you to learn valuable lessons,

00:55:32.900 --> 00:55:37.900
especially lessons that will help you search your hearts

00:55:37.900 --> 00:55:39.900
and motives.

00:55:39.900 --> 00:55:42.900
The first Kenite mentioned in the Bible as Jethro,

00:55:42.900 --> 00:55:44.900
Moses' father-in-law.

00:55:45.900 --> 00:55:49.900
When hearing that Jehovah freed the Israelites from Egypt,

00:55:49.900 --> 00:55:52.900
notice what Jethro said here, his response

00:55:52.900 --> 00:55:56.900
at Exodus chapter 18 and verse 11.

00:55:58.900 --> 00:55:59.900
Jethro says,

00:55:59.900 --> 00:56:03.900
Now I know that Jehovah is greater than all the other gods

00:56:03.900 --> 00:56:07.900
because of what he did to those who acted arrogantly

00:56:07.900 --> 00:56:09.900
against his people.

00:56:09.900 --> 00:56:10.900
That's Jethro's words.

00:56:10.900 --> 00:56:11.900
And now in verse 12,

00:56:12.900 --> 00:56:16.900
what he did was offer up sacrifices to Jehovah God.

00:56:17.900 --> 00:56:20.900
You see this Jethro, this Kenite,

00:56:20.900 --> 00:56:25.900
he recognized that Jehovah God was directing the nation of Israel

00:56:25.900 --> 00:56:29.900
and he recognized that he was to help Moses.

00:56:29.900 --> 00:56:31.900
Jehovah God was using Moses.

00:56:31.900 --> 00:56:35.900
Moses had been given this exhausting job of directing

00:56:35.900 --> 00:56:37.900
some 3 million people.

00:56:37.900 --> 00:56:38.900
So Jethro said,

00:56:39.900 --> 00:56:40.900
How can I assist?

00:56:40.900 --> 00:56:43.900
He wanted to support Moses' support.

00:56:43.900 --> 00:56:47.900
So he assisted Moses to reach a God-approved solution.

00:56:47.900 --> 00:56:50.900
Select capable trustworthy men, Moses,

00:56:50.900 --> 00:56:55.900
and appoint them as chiefs,

00:56:55.900 --> 00:56:59.900
over hundreds and 50s and tens and so forth.

00:56:59.900 --> 00:57:01.900
Them, not me, don't them.

00:57:01.900 --> 00:57:05.900
You see, Jethro was not looking for position himself.

00:57:06.900 --> 00:57:09.900
He simply gave advice to be of support to Moses.

00:57:09.900 --> 00:57:10.900
Why?

00:57:10.900 --> 00:57:15.900
So that Moses could continue to do Jehovah God's work.

00:57:15.900 --> 00:57:18.900
He wanted to be involved in helping.

00:57:18.900 --> 00:57:20.900
He saw Jehovah's blessing on Moses.

00:57:20.900 --> 00:57:22.900
He didn't criticize.

00:57:22.900 --> 00:57:24.900
Jethro didn't sit back and say,

00:57:24.900 --> 00:57:26.900
You're not even a fluent speaker.

00:57:26.900 --> 00:57:29.900
Who do you think you are trying to manage 3 million people?

00:57:29.900 --> 00:57:31.900
I knew you as a shepherd boy.

00:57:31.900 --> 00:57:32.900
Back with me.

00:57:32.900 --> 00:57:33.900
He didn't do that.

00:57:34.900 --> 00:57:36.900
He said, I want to assist.

00:57:36.900 --> 00:57:40.900
So the support of this can I prove to be invaluable,

00:57:40.900 --> 00:57:42.900
not just to Moses,

00:57:42.900 --> 00:57:45.900
but ultimately for the entire nation.

00:57:45.900 --> 00:57:47.900
That was chosen by God.

00:57:47.900 --> 00:57:50.900
So this is your first big lesson.

00:57:50.900 --> 00:57:54.900
Like Jethro, look for ways to support

00:57:54.900 --> 00:57:57.900
and to be selfless.

00:57:57.900 --> 00:57:59.900
Don't look for position.

00:57:59.900 --> 00:58:01.900
Positions come and go.

00:58:01.900 --> 00:58:04.900
But your value to Jehovah God will not.

00:58:04.900 --> 00:58:06.900
That's what Jehovah is looking for.

00:58:06.900 --> 00:58:10.900
He loves your faithful service, not position.

00:58:10.900 --> 00:58:13.900
And rather than criticize others, help.

00:58:13.900 --> 00:58:16.900
Help your brothers succeed at their work.

00:58:16.900 --> 00:58:18.900
Let them take the credit.

00:58:18.900 --> 00:58:21.900
Drain the venom of position

00:58:21.900 --> 00:58:24.900
and human recognition from your mind.

00:58:24.900 --> 00:58:26.900
Jesus said,

00:58:26.900 --> 00:58:31.900
If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing.

00:58:31.900 --> 00:58:33.900
So prove to yourself.

00:58:33.900 --> 00:58:36.900
Prove to Jehovah God

00:58:36.900 --> 00:58:41.900
that you are more for the kingdom than for the glory.

00:58:41.900 --> 00:58:43.900
That's Jethro.

00:58:43.900 --> 00:58:46.900
But the legacy of the canites continues.

00:58:46.900 --> 00:58:48.900
Jethro had a son.

00:58:48.900 --> 00:58:49.900
Hobab.

00:58:49.900 --> 00:58:52.900
Hobab was Moses' brother-in-law.

00:58:52.900 --> 00:58:54.900
So when the time now came for the Israelites

00:58:54.900 --> 00:58:56.900
to travel toward the promised land,

00:58:56.900 --> 00:59:00.900
Moses requested something from Hobab.

00:59:00.900 --> 00:59:04.900
And that's found at Numbers chapter 10.

00:59:04.900 --> 00:59:07.900
Numbers chapter 10 and verse 31.

00:59:07.900 --> 00:59:13.369
Now at this, Moses says to Hobab and verse 31,

00:59:13.369 --> 00:59:15.369
Please do not leave us.

00:59:15.369 --> 00:59:18.369
For you know where we should camp in the wilderness.

00:59:18.369 --> 00:59:20.369
You can serve as our guide.

00:59:20.369 --> 00:59:23.369
As a footnote says, our eyes.

00:59:23.369 --> 00:59:27.369
You see Moses wanted Hobab to come.

00:59:27.369 --> 00:59:30.369
Why? He was familiar with the terrain.

00:59:30.369 --> 00:59:32.369
He knew where to find water.

00:59:32.369 --> 00:59:34.369
He knew where to find pastures.

00:59:34.369 --> 00:59:36.369
Hobab saw the big picture.

00:59:36.369 --> 00:59:37.369
Hobab come with us.

00:59:37.369 --> 00:59:39.369
Serve as our eyes.

00:59:39.369 --> 00:59:41.369
Use your knowledge.

00:59:41.369 --> 00:59:44.369
Use your experience.

00:59:44.369 --> 00:59:46.369
As a scout for the nation.

00:59:46.369 --> 00:59:48.369
We need your experience.

00:59:48.369 --> 00:59:50.369
Hobab could have stayed home.

00:59:50.369 --> 00:59:51.369
Why go?

00:59:51.369 --> 00:59:53.369
I have a family of my friends.

00:59:53.369 --> 00:59:55.369
I have a comfortable life.

00:59:55.369 --> 00:59:57.369
Why should I throw my lot in with some three million people?

00:59:57.369 --> 00:59:59.369
I have no idea what's going to happen to you.

00:59:59.369 --> 01:00:01.369
But he went.

01:00:01.369 --> 01:00:04.369
Hobab, with no apparent reward for himself,

01:00:04.369 --> 01:00:09.369
he used his experience to guide the nation

01:00:09.369 --> 01:00:13.369
as they traveled toward the promised land.

01:00:13.369 --> 01:00:15.369
Now what does this mean for you?

01:00:15.369 --> 01:00:17.369
It means something big.

01:00:17.369 --> 01:00:19.369
During the past five months,

01:00:19.369 --> 01:00:23.369
you were familiar with the spiritual terrain

01:00:23.369 --> 01:00:26.369
of the 66 books of the Bible.

01:00:26.369 --> 01:00:28.369
You've been given the big picture.

01:00:28.369 --> 01:00:31.369
You got it from Genesis to Revelation.

01:00:31.369 --> 01:00:34.369
History lessons, geography lessons, archaeology lessons,

01:00:34.369 --> 01:00:36.369
lesson after lesson, day after day,

01:00:36.369 --> 01:00:38.369
written review, after written review.

01:00:38.369 --> 01:00:40.369
You got it.

01:00:40.369 --> 01:00:42.369
Use your experience now.

01:00:42.369 --> 01:00:44.369
Use that knowledge to do what?

01:00:44.369 --> 01:00:48.369
To serve as a guide for others.

01:00:48.369 --> 01:00:53.369
For example, when someone faces a crisis of faith,

01:00:53.369 --> 01:00:57.369
they might find it difficult to travel this unfamiliar terrain.

01:00:57.369 --> 01:00:59.369
It could be challenging for them.

01:00:59.369 --> 01:01:03.369
Show them from God's Word where they can find spiritual water.

01:01:03.369 --> 01:01:05.369
Where can they get refreshment?

01:01:05.369 --> 01:01:07.369
Where can they get the energy?

01:01:07.369 --> 01:01:10.369
Help them travel that terrain.

01:01:10.369 --> 01:01:13.650
You owe it to them.

01:01:13.650 --> 01:01:17.650
You have been given a beautiful view while being here at school

01:01:17.650 --> 01:01:21.650
of the organization, a unique vista of God's organization

01:01:21.650 --> 01:01:23.650
that many will never see.

01:01:23.650 --> 01:01:26.650
You go back to your assignments and many will never experience

01:01:26.650 --> 01:01:28.650
what you've been able to experience.

01:01:28.650 --> 01:01:33.119
Share with them your memories, your experience,

01:01:33.119 --> 01:01:37.119
strengthen their confidence in Jehovah God's organization.

01:01:37.119 --> 01:01:41.119
Don't be stingy by holding your knowledge hostage.

01:01:41.119 --> 01:01:46.119
Train too to become better than you.

01:01:46.119 --> 01:01:49.119
Then they train too.

01:01:49.119 --> 01:01:51.119
And then they train too.

01:01:51.119 --> 01:01:54.119
And they train too.

01:01:54.119 --> 01:02:01.119
Imagine if you adopt an embrace, this healthy mindset,

01:02:01.119 --> 01:02:08.119
you will help forge a path toward a strong and unified organization.

01:02:08.119 --> 01:02:11.119
That's your responsibility.

01:02:11.119 --> 01:02:15.119
So now we have two generations of canites

01:02:15.119 --> 01:02:20.119
who loyally supported Jehovah God and his people.

01:02:20.119 --> 01:02:23.119
A legacy had begun.

01:02:23.119 --> 01:02:25.119
Would it continue?

01:02:25.119 --> 01:02:28.119
Well, let's jump ahead to the time of the kings.

01:02:28.119 --> 01:02:31.119
We have First Chronicles 255,

01:02:31.119 --> 01:02:34.119
identifies another canite named recap,

01:02:34.119 --> 01:02:37.119
and his son was Jehonadab.

01:02:37.119 --> 01:02:41.119
Jehonadab lived during the time period of King Jehu.

01:02:41.119 --> 01:02:45.119
When Jehovah God commissioned Jehu to go wipe out bail worship.

01:02:45.119 --> 01:02:47.119
And then Jehonadab comes out.

01:02:47.119 --> 01:02:49.119
He meets Jehu.

01:02:49.119 --> 01:02:51.119
Imagine he wants to meet him.

01:02:51.119 --> 01:02:53.119
He wants to support Jehu.

01:02:53.119 --> 01:02:55.119
Second Kings 10, 15.

01:02:55.119 --> 01:02:56.119
What did Jehu say?

01:02:56.119 --> 01:02:58.119
Jehonadab, is your heart with me?

01:02:58.119 --> 01:02:59.119
It is.

01:02:59.119 --> 01:03:00.119
My heart's with you.

01:03:00.119 --> 01:03:02.119
Then get up into this chariot.

01:03:02.119 --> 01:03:03.119
Pull them up in.

01:03:03.119 --> 01:03:05.119
Wonderful.

01:03:05.119 --> 01:03:07.119
Jehonadab wanted to support.

01:03:07.119 --> 01:03:10.119
It was a privilege for Jehonadab

01:03:10.119 --> 01:03:13.119
to come out publicly and show his loyalty

01:03:13.119 --> 01:03:16.119
for Jehu's God-given commission of privilege.

01:03:16.119 --> 01:03:19.119
I'm going to be with you.

01:03:19.119 --> 01:03:22.119
When Jehonadab accepted Jehu's hand, imagine.

01:03:22.119 --> 01:03:24.119
Step into that chariot.

01:03:24.119 --> 01:03:25.119
He didn't get underneath.

01:03:25.119 --> 01:03:26.119
He stood up.

01:03:26.119 --> 01:03:29.119
He was proud to be a part of that process.

01:03:29.119 --> 01:03:31.119
He in effect was saying,

01:03:31.119 --> 01:03:34.119
Jehu, I'm sticking with you.

01:03:34.119 --> 01:03:36.119
Whatever you need,

01:03:36.119 --> 01:03:38.119
it doesn't matter what the job is.

01:03:38.119 --> 01:03:40.119
I'm with you.

01:03:40.119 --> 01:03:42.119
Like Jehonadab,

01:03:42.119 --> 01:03:44.119
be determined to accept the privilege

01:03:44.119 --> 01:03:47.119
of loyally supporting the decisions

01:03:47.119 --> 01:03:50.119
made by God's visible organization.

01:03:50.119 --> 01:03:53.119
Support those decisions today.

01:03:53.119 --> 01:03:56.119
Tomorrow, next week, next month, next year,

01:03:56.119 --> 01:03:57.119
who knows?

01:03:57.119 --> 01:03:59.119
But you're going to be a part of this.

01:03:59.119 --> 01:04:02.119
And it's big.

01:04:02.119 --> 01:04:04.119
You know, from a human standpoint,

01:04:04.119 --> 01:04:06.119
the canites had no royal lineage,

01:04:06.119 --> 01:04:08.119
no notable accomplishments, no home,

01:04:08.119 --> 01:04:10.119
there's no country of canite.

01:04:10.119 --> 01:04:13.119
They're easy to miss and overlook.

01:04:13.119 --> 01:04:17.119
Unsung as a people,

01:04:17.119 --> 01:04:21.119
but not unseen by Jehovah.

01:04:21.119 --> 01:04:23.119
Jehovah saw these faithful canites.

01:04:23.119 --> 01:04:25.119
All they had done for his people

01:04:25.119 --> 01:04:27.119
and he never forgot them.

01:04:27.119 --> 01:04:29.119
Jehovah didn't forget them.

01:04:29.119 --> 01:04:30.119
He loved them.

01:04:30.119 --> 01:04:33.119
How do we know?

01:04:33.119 --> 01:04:34.119
Well, again,

01:04:34.119 --> 01:04:37.119
First Chronicles 255 says they are part

01:04:37.119 --> 01:04:39.119
of the genealogy of Judah.

01:04:39.119 --> 01:04:41.119
They're tacked on at the end.

01:04:41.119 --> 01:04:43.119
Jehovah said, welcome to the family.

01:04:43.119 --> 01:04:45.119
Beautiful.

01:04:45.119 --> 01:04:49.119
First Samuel 156 shows that Jehovah protected them

01:04:49.119 --> 01:04:51.119
when Saul was going against the Amalakites

01:04:51.119 --> 01:04:53.119
and the canites get out of the way

01:04:53.119 --> 01:04:55.119
because of your loyal love.

01:04:55.119 --> 01:04:56.119
Move out of the way.

01:04:56.119 --> 01:04:58.119
You don't get hurt.

01:04:58.119 --> 01:05:00.119
And he rewarded them.

01:05:00.119 --> 01:05:02.119
In Jeremiah's day,

01:05:02.119 --> 01:05:03.119
he concluded a covenant

01:05:03.119 --> 01:05:04.119
with Jehovah's descendants,

01:05:04.119 --> 01:05:05.119
the recapites,

01:05:05.119 --> 01:05:10.119
because of their enduring loyalty for decades.

01:05:10.119 --> 01:05:15.119
Jehovah declared at Jeremiah 3519.

01:05:15.119 --> 01:05:17.119
There will never fail to be a descendant

01:05:17.119 --> 01:05:19.119
of Jehovah's Dab,

01:05:19.119 --> 01:05:21.119
the son of recap,

01:05:21.119 --> 01:05:25.119
effort to serve in my presence.

01:05:26.119 --> 01:05:29.119
Jehovah respected the loyal endurance

01:05:29.119 --> 01:05:31.119
of these recapites.

01:05:31.119 --> 01:05:34.119
He promised that they would survive the destruction

01:05:34.119 --> 01:05:38.119
of Jerusalem in 607 BCE.

01:05:38.119 --> 01:05:41.119
There will never fail to be a descendant

01:05:41.119 --> 01:05:43.119
in my presence.

01:05:43.119 --> 01:05:44.119
Perhaps.

01:05:44.119 --> 01:05:46.119
Just perhaps.

01:05:46.119 --> 01:05:49.119
There were descendants of the canites in Jesus' time

01:05:49.119 --> 01:05:52.119
that later became his disciples

01:05:52.119 --> 01:05:54.119
and are in heaven right now.

01:05:54.119 --> 01:05:56.119
He can't say for a certainty.

01:05:56.119 --> 01:05:57.119
We don't know.

01:05:57.119 --> 01:05:59.119
But we would not be surprised.

01:05:59.119 --> 01:06:05.159
This is a valuable lesson for you.

01:06:05.159 --> 01:06:08.159
If you're in a land where our work is restricted,

01:06:08.159 --> 01:06:11.159
or an area where if you know the work you are doing,

01:06:11.159 --> 01:06:16.159
you might feel alone without an army of support.

01:06:16.159 --> 01:06:22.159
You're sure that Jehovah's eyes are on your enduring loyalty.

01:06:22.159 --> 01:06:26.159
And he so deeply appreciates your faithfulness.

01:06:26.159 --> 01:06:30.159
You see, like the canites, your work,

01:06:30.159 --> 01:06:32.159
it might not be in the spotlight.

01:06:32.159 --> 01:06:36.159
At times you might feel overlooked, unacknowledged,

01:06:36.159 --> 01:06:39.159
maybe unsung by humans.

01:06:39.159 --> 01:06:43.159
But again, never unseen by Jehovah.

01:06:43.159 --> 01:06:46.159
And just as Jehovah did with the canites,

01:06:46.159 --> 01:06:49.159
know that your Heavenly Father cherishes

01:06:49.159 --> 01:06:52.159
and treasures everything you do

01:06:52.159 --> 01:06:55.159
and will never forget your faithful service.

01:06:55.159 --> 01:06:58.159
The canites teach us what we need to do,

01:06:58.159 --> 01:07:01.159
what you and me, what we need to do

01:07:01.159 --> 01:07:03.159
to be approved by Jehovah.

01:07:03.159 --> 01:07:04.159
It's so precious.

01:07:04.159 --> 01:07:06.159
What do we need to do?

01:07:06.159 --> 01:07:08.159
Nothing spectacular.

01:07:08.159 --> 01:07:10.159
Just be faithful.

01:07:10.159 --> 01:07:12.159
It's not about fanfare.

01:07:12.159 --> 01:07:16.159
It's silent resilience.

01:07:16.159 --> 01:07:22.539
The legacy of the canites is now yours.

01:07:22.539 --> 01:07:24.539
What will you do?

01:07:25.539 --> 01:07:27.539
What will you do with it?

01:07:27.539 --> 01:07:29.539
Be a Jethro.

01:07:29.539 --> 01:07:32.539
Prove that you love the kingdom

01:07:32.539 --> 01:07:36.539
and your brothers more than your position.

01:07:36.539 --> 01:07:38.539
Be a Hobab.

01:07:38.539 --> 01:07:41.539
Use your experience to help your brothers find refreshment

01:07:41.539 --> 01:07:44.539
bolstering their spiritual energy

01:07:44.539 --> 01:07:47.539
to climb those difficult terrains.

01:07:47.539 --> 01:07:49.539
And be a Jihonadab.

01:07:49.539 --> 01:07:52.539
Show your loyal support,

01:07:52.539 --> 01:07:55.539
loyalty for Jehovah and his organization

01:07:55.539 --> 01:07:57.539
by saying, I'll do whatever you need.

01:07:57.539 --> 01:07:59.539
For however long,

01:07:59.539 --> 01:08:02.539
the job doesn't matter.

01:08:02.539 --> 01:08:05.539
By imitating the canites,

01:08:05.539 --> 01:08:08.539
their example will live on in you

01:08:08.539 --> 01:08:11.539
and their unsung loyal support

01:08:11.539 --> 01:08:21.380
will remain unforgettable.

01:08:21.380 --> 01:08:23.380
Well, we appreciate that.

01:08:23.380 --> 01:08:26.380
Why is counsel very much?

01:08:26.380 --> 01:08:30.380
What a riveting and faith strengthening program.

01:08:30.380 --> 01:08:32.380
Before we conclude,

01:08:32.380 --> 01:08:35.380
we'd like to share these greetings from Bulgaria.

01:08:35.380 --> 01:08:38.380
Bulgaria is a beautiful mountainous country

01:08:38.380 --> 01:08:40.380
and southeastern Europe.

01:08:40.380 --> 01:08:45.380
Individual farms are still an important part of life.

01:08:45.380 --> 01:08:48.380
Many people still vent their own wine,

01:08:48.380 --> 01:08:50.380
can their own fruits and vegetables,

01:08:50.380 --> 01:08:52.380
and chop their own firewood

01:08:52.380 --> 01:08:55.380
to prepare for the cold winters.

01:08:55.380 --> 01:08:57.380
In late 1989,

01:08:57.380 --> 01:09:00.380
when the upheaval of communism shook Bulgaria,

01:09:00.380 --> 01:09:04.380
there were less than 50 publishers in the entire country.

01:09:04.380 --> 01:09:06.380
In 1991,

01:09:06.380 --> 01:09:10.380
the first Gilead-trained missionaries were assigned there.

01:09:10.380 --> 01:09:15.380
Today, Bulgaria has some 2,500 publishers.

01:09:15.380 --> 01:09:19.380
Let's visit the congregation in Vratsa,

01:09:19.380 --> 01:09:23.380
a town where houses are built right up to the steep mountain cliffs.

01:09:23.380 --> 01:09:26.380
The dramatic rock formations, waterfalls,

01:09:26.380 --> 01:09:29.380
and caves attract many tourists.

01:09:29.380 --> 01:09:33.380
The Vratsa congregation has 43 publishers,

01:09:33.380 --> 01:09:36.380
of which five serve as elders.

01:09:36.380 --> 01:09:40.380
The publishers conduct on average 80 Bible studies each month.

01:09:40.380 --> 01:09:43.380
Witnesses from other European countries

01:09:43.380 --> 01:09:46.380
have moved there to help in the ministry.

01:09:46.380 --> 01:09:49.380
The congregation has 14 regular pioneers,

01:09:49.380 --> 01:09:54.380
two special pioneers, and two missionaries.

01:09:54.380 --> 01:09:58.380
In the recent past, the brothers and sisters in Vratsa

01:09:58.380 --> 01:10:03.380
could be issued a fine just for participating in the preaching work,

01:10:03.380 --> 01:10:06.380
and some were harassed by the police.

01:10:06.380 --> 01:10:08.380
But in October 2017,

01:10:08.380 --> 01:10:11.380
the congregation rejoiced when a local court ruled

01:10:11.380 --> 01:10:16.380
that limiting our preaching work is unconstitutional.

01:10:16.380 --> 01:10:20.380
We keep our brothers and sisters in Bulgaria in our prayers.

01:10:20.380 --> 01:10:24.380
We love them very much.

01:10:24.380 --> 01:10:27.380
From the World Headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses,

01:10:27.380 --> 01:10:30.380
this is JW Broadcasting.
