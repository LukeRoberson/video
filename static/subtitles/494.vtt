00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:07.969
Our sacred service is our sacrifice, our gift to Jehovah.

00:00:07.969 --> 00:00:09.970
But here's a key point.

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:14.970
Before Jehovah looks at our gift, he looks at us.

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:19.969
He must accept us first if he's to accept our gift.

00:00:19.969 --> 00:00:22.969
So here's the key question then.

00:00:22.969 --> 00:00:25.969
What does Jehovah look for in us?

00:00:25.969 --> 00:00:30.969
We're going to use three Bible examples to explore that question.

00:00:30.969 --> 00:00:36.969
Let's begin in the most holy of the tabernacle on the day of atonement.

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:42.969
A high priest's mission is to offer sin offering for himself and for the nation.

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:49.969
But before he can do that, Jehovah tells him to do something very specific as depicted here.

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:56.969
It's recorded in Leviticus chapter 16 verses 12 and 13.

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.969
So please turn with me to that.

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:04.969
Leviticus chapter 16, the first time he enters the most holy on that day,

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:09.969
he will then take the firehold of full of burning calls from the altar before Jehovah,

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:15.969
to handfuls of fine perfumed incense, and he will bring them inside the curtain.

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:19.969
He will also put the incense on the fire before Jehovah,

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:23.969
and the cloud of the incense will envelop the ark cover, which is on the testimony,

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:27.969
so that he may not die.

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:30.969
Clearly, from their last phrase,

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:38.969
Jehovah needed to approve of the high priest and what he did if he was to accept the sin offering.

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:44.209
He had to bring an incense.

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:48.209
In the Bible, incense is associated with prayer.

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:55.209
So clearly, the high priest had to come in with a humble, prayerful attitude.

00:01:55.209 --> 00:02:02.209
Imagine, though, if he decided to bring his own incense recipe because he preferred that smell.

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:06.209
Did Jehovah likely to accept that?

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:10.210
Or what if he followed the procedure perfectly?

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:15.210
But yesterday, he was leading the nation in worship to Molek.

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.210
Would Jehovah approve of what he did on this day?

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:24.490
So what qualities was Jehovah looking for in the high priest?

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:36.370
A humble, prayerful attitude, strict obedience to direction, moral and spiritual integrity.

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:47.060
Everything on that day, the high priest and his sin offering, pictured Jesus Christ.

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.060
So what can we learn from Jesus while he was on earth?

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.060
There's a beautiful description in Hebrews chapter 5, verses 7 and 8.

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:03.060
Let's read together in that verse and pick out what this tells us about Jesus.

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.060
Hebrews 5, 7 and 8.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:14.060
During his life on earth, Christ offered up supplications and also petitions with strong outcries and tears

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.060
to the one who was able to save him out of death.

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.060
And he was favorably hurt for his godly fear.

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:27.060
Although he was a son, he learned obedience from the things he suffered.

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:32.400
Supplications and petitions.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:41.400
Although he was the perfect son of God, Jesus humbly recognized his total dependence on his father.

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:46.400
From verse 8, it's easy to pick up that key quality.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:52.400
He was perfectly obedient in carrying out Jehovah's will for him.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.400
And what about this phrase at the end of verse 7?

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.400
He was favorably hurt for his godly fear.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:05.400
Yes, Jesus fervent desire to please Jehovah in everything.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.400
That was the source of his perfect integrity.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.539
The question though is why?

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:15.539
What moved Jesus to do these things?

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:25.750
Well, in his own words, John 1431, in order for the world to know that I love the father.

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:28.750
What did Jehovah see in Jesus?

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:38.750
He saw remarkable humility, total dependence on his father, perfect obedience, flawless integrity,

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:46.089
and the purest of motives, love for his father.

00:04:46.089 --> 00:04:50.089
It's no wonder that Jehovah looked down and said,

00:04:50.089 --> 00:04:54.089
this is my son, the beloved whom I have approved.

00:04:54.089 --> 00:05:00.089
Jehovah approved Jesus, and he approved of the ransom sacrifice.

00:05:00.089 --> 00:05:02.089
So now it's down to us.

00:05:02.089 --> 00:05:05.089
What is Jehovah looking for in you and me?

00:05:05.089 --> 00:05:11.089
Well, as with Jesus, he's looking for the right qualities and the right motive.

00:05:11.089 --> 00:05:14.089
So qualities and motive.

00:05:14.089 --> 00:05:18.089
That's familiar to us, even in human relationships.

00:05:18.089 --> 00:05:25.089
We've all seen the picture of a sheepish husband who comes home carrying a big bouquet of flowers.

00:05:25.089 --> 00:05:30.089
Well, he's done something that's going to make his wife angry when she finds out,

00:05:30.089 --> 00:05:35.089
and he wants to appease her to make her less angry.

00:05:35.089 --> 00:05:38.089
Is she going to be happy with that?

00:05:38.089 --> 00:05:43.089
She may accept the flowers, but she does not want to be appeased.

00:05:43.089 --> 00:05:54.089
What she wants is a loyal husband to give her a gift because he loves her, qualities and motive.

00:05:54.089 --> 00:06:00.089
So with this in mind, let's learn one further lesson from the example of King David.

00:06:00.089 --> 00:06:05.089
Now, Jehovah had told David that he would not be the one that would build the temple,

00:06:05.089 --> 00:06:10.089
and David obeyed Jehovah's direction, but he loved pure worship.

00:06:10.089 --> 00:06:12.089
He wanted to do something.

00:06:12.089 --> 00:06:20.089
So David carefully studied the temple plan that Jehovah gave him, and then he brought Jehovah a gift.

00:06:20.089 --> 00:06:22.089
And what a gift it was.

00:06:22.089 --> 00:06:27.089
From his personal fortune, gold, silver, so many other things.

00:06:27.089 --> 00:06:36.089
You know, just the gold and silver from his personal fortune was worth almost $6 billion.

00:06:37.089 --> 00:06:43.089
When David was ready to present that gift to Jehovah, he said a special prayer.

00:06:43.089 --> 00:06:48.089
And we're going to look at it in First Chronicles chapter 29,

00:06:48.089 --> 00:06:53.089
verses 10 through 17 is the prayer, it's worth its own study project.

00:06:53.089 --> 00:06:56.089
But we'll look at just a few key points.

00:06:56.089 --> 00:07:02.089
Please look to see what each of these reveals about David as the giver of the gift.

00:07:02.089 --> 00:07:06.089
So First Chronicles chapter 29 verse 14.

00:07:06.089 --> 00:07:14.779
Who am I? Who are my people that we should be in a position to make voluntary offerings like this?

00:07:14.779 --> 00:07:21.779
For everything is from you, and we have given you what comes from your own hand.

00:07:21.779 --> 00:07:25.779
Wow. Despite his rank, his seniority,

00:07:25.779 --> 00:07:32.779
David humbly recognized what it privileged was to be able to do anything for Jehovah.

00:07:33.779 --> 00:07:36.779
Now glance down at verse 17.

00:07:36.779 --> 00:07:41.779
What would make Jehovah approve of this gift?

00:07:41.779 --> 00:07:50.779
I will know, oh my God, that you examine the heart and that you take pleasure in integrity.

00:07:50.779 --> 00:07:56.779
In the uprightness of my heart, I voluntarily offered all these things.

00:07:56.779 --> 00:07:59.779
That's why Jehovah would approve the gift.

00:08:00.779 --> 00:08:09.779
Now bear in mind, David has just presented to Jehovah billions of dollars worth of gifts.

00:08:09.779 --> 00:08:12.779
And yet look at verse 13.

00:08:12.779 --> 00:08:14.779
This is his motive.

00:08:14.779 --> 00:08:21.779
And now, oh my God, we thank you and praise your beautiful name.

00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:32.350
His gratitude moved David to give everything that he possibly could to Jehovah.

00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:37.350
So how are we like David when we give gifts to Jehovah?

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:43.350
Or we humbly recognize what a privilege it is to be able to do anything for Jehovah.

00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:47.350
We keep strict obedience to direction.

00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:50.350
We fight to maintain our integrity.

00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:57.350
It's our love and our gratitude that moves us to give Jehovah everything that we can.

00:08:57.350 --> 00:08:59.350
Our very best.

00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:06.350
When Jehovah sees these qualities and these motives in us, then he's very pleased.

00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:14.350
And he will be pleased to accept our gift, whether we give him the fortune of David or the widow's might.

00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:19.350
So what gift will you bring to Jehovah today?

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:23.350
Jehovah smile when he sees you.

00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:28.350
And may he approve of your good qualities, your good motive.

00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:33.350
And may he turn your gift into a blessing for you and for many others.
