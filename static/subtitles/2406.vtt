00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.620
The shovel in the wood, this humanity

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:30.620
No matter where, there's people suffering

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:33.420
Fighting for change

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.820
But among God's people, we trust His name

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.020
So we must take close to His war

00:00:43.020 --> 00:01:34.000
Oh, we stand here to see the anxieties

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
But hope is revealed

00:01:36.000 --> 00:02:42.830
Show love as we spray
