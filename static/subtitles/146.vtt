00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:09.699
The theme of this program is look back to learn, look ahead to live.

00:00:09.699 --> 00:00:17.899
It's based on Isaiah, chapter 30, verse 21, which was written about 700 years before Christ.

00:00:17.899 --> 00:00:25.140
The question is, how might we apply Isaiah 30-21 to Jehovah's people today?

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:33.659
The text reads, and your own ears will hear a word behind you, saying, this is the way.

00:00:33.659 --> 00:00:41.179
Walk in it, in case you should go to the right, or in case you should go to the left.

00:00:41.179 --> 00:00:47.380
This scripture tells us that Jehovah's word comes from behind his people, issuing directions

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.020
on the right way to walk.

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:55.579
When we turn to God's word for guidance, we are reading words that were recorded thousands

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:01.939
of years ago, coming from behind us as it were in the stream of time.

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:06.819
This ties in nicely with Paul's words at Romans 15-4.

00:01:06.819 --> 00:01:14.019
For all the things that were written beforehand were written for our instruction.

00:01:14.019 --> 00:01:19.900
There are many things that we can learn by looking back at Bible characters.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:26.620
Looking their attitude, conduct, and quality of faith can help us to make wise decisions

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.459
and to avoid pitfalls.

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:35.340
Also we need to appreciate that experience is not always the best teacher.

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.060
Some people go through life only learning lessons after making one painful mistake after

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.739
another.

00:01:41.739 --> 00:01:47.819
It is far better to learn from examples of the past.

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:55.780
Looking back to our first human parents, we see clearly the importance of obeying Jehovah.

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.659
For hundreds of years, Adam and Eve must have looked back to the life they had in the

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:07.060
Garden of Eden before they sinned, but they felt no joy in doing so.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:13.819
As they grew older and more decrepit, they must have been filled with sadness and bitterness,

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:17.659
and there may have been many exchanges of unkind words.

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:24.020
Yes, they looked back at what they lost, but it did not benefit them, for they were

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:29.460
created perfect and were willfully disobedient to God.

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:37.300
Noah, who was born about 126 years after Adam died, would have known of Adam's disobedience

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.379
and its consequences.

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:44.139
Noah looked back and benefited from that knowledge.

00:02:44.139 --> 00:02:49.419
He obeyed Jehovah and fixed his eyes on the unseen future.

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:52.819
The foretold earth-wide flood.

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:58.300
Also he kept busy constructing an ark and preaching to the people of his day.

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.620
It is only reasonable to believe that Noah's three sons cooperated fully with him and

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.020
building the ark.

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:08.819
But what about the wives of Noah's sons?

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:12.819
There is no mention of their families in Scripture.

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:17.979
The wives of Noah's sons must have been strong in faith, determined to stick with their

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:24.460
husbands, and with God's servant Noah, even though none of their family members went

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:27.740
into the ark for survival.

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:34.900
The wives of Noah's sons provide an example for serious thought.

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:43.740
A few hundred years after the flood, Abraham and Sarah left the city of Eur to serve Jehovah.

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:49.419
Wherever he designated, they looked ahead and kept their eyes fixed on the promises

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:51.219
of God.

00:03:51.219 --> 00:03:57.979
The Apostle Paul indicates that Abraham and Sarah did not dwell on what they left behind.

00:03:57.979 --> 00:04:06.919
Paul makes that point in Hebrews 11-15, and what a good lesson it is for us.

00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:16.899
Hebrews 11-15 reads,

00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:23.620
and yet if they had kept remembering the place from which they had departed, they would

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.699
have had opportunity to return.

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:33.540
Like Abraham and Sarah, we want to keep our attention fixed, not on the things that we

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:41.579
have left behind, but rather on serving Jehovah and on his promises for the future.

00:04:41.579 --> 00:04:46.939
Lot was a contemporary of Abraham, and there are vital lessons we can learn from the account

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:49.620
about Lot's wife.

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:56.560
Genesis 1912 and 13 tell us not only that Sodom would be destroyed, but also that Lot and

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.879
his people in the city should flee immediately.

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:06.000
Then verse 17 says that as soon as the angels had brought Lot and his family to the outskirts

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.800
of Sodom, they were told,

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:15.839
"'Escape for your life, do not look behind you, and do not stand still in any part of the

00:05:15.839 --> 00:05:23.279
district, escape to the mountainous region so that you may not be swept away.'"

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:30.160
After fleeing Sodom, Lot's wife disobeyed God by looking back.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:34.000
What may have been involved in her looking back?

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:40.000
There is nothing to indicate that she in any way approved of the immorality of Sodom,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.560
but was her attachment to her home and the material thing she had there stronger than

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.240
her love for God?

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.079
Whatever her reason,

00:05:50.079 --> 00:06:00.360
what Jesus said at Luke chapter 17 verses 31 and 32 emphasizes the importance of obedience

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.439
and urgency.

00:06:02.439 --> 00:06:03.839
He said,

00:06:03.839 --> 00:06:12.519
"'Luke 17 31, on that day let the person who is on the house top, but whose belongings

00:06:12.519 --> 00:06:19.040
are in the house not come down to pick these up, and likewise the person out in the field

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:23.199
must not return to the things behind.

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:31.639
And notice the way Jesus now ties together urgency with obedience in verse 32.

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:36.000
Remember the wife of Lot.'

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:45.000
Genesis 1926 says that Lot's wife disobeyedly began to look back and she became a pillar

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.040
of salt.

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:54.279
After this thought-provoking comment on pages 18 and 19 of the April 15, 1990 issue of

00:06:54.279 --> 00:06:57.910
the watchtower,

00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:03.829
now a further test of loyalty faced Lot and his daughters.

00:07:03.829 --> 00:07:09.350
Was Lot's attachment to his deceased wife or the girl's feelings for their dead mother

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:15.389
stronger than their love for Jehovah who had brought about this calamity?

00:07:15.389 --> 00:07:21.069
Would they continue to obey God even though someone very close to them proved disloyal

00:07:21.069 --> 00:07:23.069
to him?

00:07:23.069 --> 00:07:29.269
With full trust in Jehovah, they did not look back.

00:07:29.269 --> 00:07:34.759
Is there not a lesson in this account for us?

00:07:34.759 --> 00:07:39.959
Moses looked to Jehovah for his blessings and not to the position of privilege that he

00:07:39.959 --> 00:07:42.040
had in Egypt.

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:49.839
We want to be like Moses and not fantasize about wealth, possessions, and fame.

00:07:49.839 --> 00:07:52.399
And what about her?

00:07:52.399 --> 00:07:55.439
What can we learn by examining his life?

00:07:55.439 --> 00:08:00.079
No, this is not the bend her from the movie.

00:08:00.079 --> 00:08:04.959
This her lived during the time period of Moses and Joshua.

00:08:04.959 --> 00:08:11.439
Like many of Jehovah's people, he played a supporting role in doing God's will.

00:08:11.439 --> 00:08:17.399
We don't know much about him, but what we do know shows that he was available and willing

00:08:17.399 --> 00:08:20.920
to give support to Moses.

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:32.000
The account recorded at Exodus chapter 17 verses 8-13 occurred shortly after the Israelites

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.360
left Egypt.

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:39.399
Exodus 17 8-13 reads as follows.

00:08:39.399 --> 00:08:44.960
When the Amalakites came and fought against Israel and referred him, at this Moses said

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:51.320
to Joshua, choose men for us and go out to fight against the Amalakites.

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:57.759
Tomorrow I will stand on top of the hill with the rod of the true God in my hand.

00:08:57.759 --> 00:09:04.519
Then Joshua did just as Moses told him, and he fought against the Amalakites, and Moses

00:09:04.519 --> 00:09:09.679
Aaron and her went up to the top of the hill.

00:09:09.679 --> 00:09:16.000
As long as Moses kept his hands lifted up, the Israelites prevailed, but as soon as he

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:21.440
would let down his hands, the Amalakites prevailed.

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:26.399
When the hands of Moses were heavy, they took a stone and put it under him, and he sat

00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:27.879
on it.

00:09:27.879 --> 00:09:34.879
When Aaron and her, one on each side, supported his hands so that his hands remained steady

00:09:34.879 --> 00:09:42.679
until the sun set, thus Joshua defeated Amalek and his people with the sword.

00:09:42.679 --> 00:09:49.360
The supporting role her played could be viewed as incidental, and not something extraordinary,

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:54.960
since many other men in Israel could have assisted Moses by holding up one of his hands.

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:59.799
However, we can benefit from her example.

00:09:59.799 --> 00:10:06.120
Many brothers and sisters perform essential support work to advance Kingdom interests,

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:12.919
but they are rarely, if ever in the limelight, nor are they well known by the brotherhood.

00:10:12.919 --> 00:10:19.759
But Jehovah knows who you are, and he appreciates what you do.

00:10:19.759 --> 00:10:26.480
Hebrews chapter 6, verse 10, gives us this assurance.

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:29.159
Hebrews 6, 10 reads,

00:10:29.159 --> 00:10:36.600
For God is not unrighteous so as to forget your work, and the love you showed for his name

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:42.360
by ministering and continuing to minister to the holy ones.

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:49.000
Oftentimes we humans forget about the good that others do, but Jehovah never forgets

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.919
the good works of his faithful servants.

00:10:52.919 --> 00:10:59.799
And now consider a man who was a gross wrongdoer, guilty of the most heinous crimes and violations

00:10:59.799 --> 00:11:01.919
of God's laws.

00:11:01.919 --> 00:11:04.519
He was King Manasseh.

00:11:04.519 --> 00:11:10.480
Not only does the Bible account of his repentance amaze us, but even more outstanding is the fact

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:15.679
that Jehovah accepted his repentance and showed him mercy.

00:11:15.679 --> 00:11:20.360
How kind of Jehovah to allow this account to be in his word?

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:26.559
We look back to Manasseh who stands as an example of the great mercy that Jehovah extends

00:11:26.559 --> 00:11:34.240
to all who genuinely repent of their wrongdoings and make straight paths for their feet.

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:40.519
Manasseh's repentance must have been genuine, for no one can deceive Jehovah.

00:11:40.519 --> 00:11:44.840
And Manasseh's example should encourage those who may think that they have gone too far

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:50.360
astray to be forgiven and receive Jehovah's tender mercies.

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:55.639
How much we appreciate the brochure, return to Jehovah.

00:11:55.639 --> 00:12:02.200
It constitutes a loving invitation to take the necessary steps to draw close to Jehovah

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:06.159
and then remain in his love.

00:12:06.159 --> 00:12:09.919
We draw close to the Father through Jesus Christ.

00:12:09.919 --> 00:12:17.600
For he himself declared at John 146, no one comes to the Father except through me.

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:21.360
Jesus invites us to learn from him.

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:28.399
In the 2015 Convention Video Drama, for a certainty God made him Lord and Christ, we

00:12:28.399 --> 00:12:34.840
learn much about Jesus' love for people and his affection for his disciples.

00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:42.039
Unforgettable and heartwarming was the scene of Jesus warmly embracing each disciple before

00:12:42.039 --> 00:12:44.639
ascending to heaven.

00:12:44.639 --> 00:12:47.519
Did Jesus actually do that?

00:12:47.519 --> 00:12:49.240
I don't know.

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:56.200
But it's only reasonable to believe that he would show such affection to his loyal disciples.

00:12:56.200 --> 00:13:02.240
After all, according to John 21, 25, Jesus did many things that are not recorded in the

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:10.519
scriptures and Jesus has also proved to be faithful to his promise, to be with his disciples

00:13:10.519 --> 00:13:13.840
to the end of the system of things.

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:18.730
Do we not see evidence of that today?

00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:23.850
The Apostle Peter was someone that most of us can relate to.

00:13:23.850 --> 00:13:30.090
After Jesus' resurrection, Peter became a zealous and fearless preacher of the good news.

00:13:30.169 --> 00:13:37.169
He did not look back on his mistakes and continue beating himself for denying Jesus three times.

00:13:37.169 --> 00:13:41.330
He did not give up because Jesus called him Satan.

00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:47.970
He did not quit and run away feeling sorry for himself, nor did he quit when Paul reprimanded

00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:51.250
him in front of many disciples.

00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:55.850
Peter was a humble man who loved Jehovah.

00:13:55.850 --> 00:14:01.210
Here is much we can learn by looking back on Peter's life.

00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:05.730
Never quit or give up in the race for life.

00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:11.769
When we are disciplined, we want to imitate Peter and make the needed changes.

00:14:11.769 --> 00:14:18.769
We put our full trust in Jesus' ransom sacrifice that does indeed cleanse us from inherited

00:14:18.769 --> 00:14:22.809
sin and from our own mistakes.

00:14:22.809 --> 00:14:28.690
We must not allow ourselves to be consumed by self-pity and inactivity.

00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:36.090
Yes, there are many ways that we can benefit from looking back at Peter and learning from

00:14:36.090 --> 00:14:39.330
his experiences.

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:44.409
The Apostle John was another man of great faith and endurance.

00:14:44.409 --> 00:14:51.049
At about 99 years of age, the Apostle John looked back some 65 years and was able with

00:14:51.049 --> 00:14:57.129
the help of Holy Spirit to remember so much about Jesus' life and works that he could

00:14:57.129 --> 00:14:59.769
write the Gospel of John.

00:14:59.769 --> 00:15:05.490
He looked back not only to remember what he had learned from Jesus, but also because

00:15:05.490 --> 00:15:09.889
he wanted future generations to learn about Jesus.

00:15:09.889 --> 00:15:16.610
But John also looked ahead with faith in Jehovah's promise about Jesus as King of the

00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:23.529
coming kingdom, declaring in the conclusion of the Book of Revelation, Amen.

00:15:23.529 --> 00:15:27.289
Come, Lord Jesus.

00:15:27.289 --> 00:15:34.289
Yes, we look back to learn from God's Word and see the many ways in which it can benefit

00:15:34.289 --> 00:15:36.009
us.

00:15:36.009 --> 00:15:42.370
At the same time, we look ahead to the future, to the real life in the new world when we

00:15:42.370 --> 00:15:47.570
will be able to enjoy life in ways not possible today.

00:15:47.570 --> 00:15:54.970
How good it is to know the truth, to serve our great God, Jehovah, and to be a part of

00:15:54.970 --> 00:15:56.690
the worldwide brotherhood.
