00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:18.649
My name is Kiara, and that's my husband, Sean.

00:00:18.649 --> 00:00:24.129
Our son at Keele moved out recently to help where the need is greater.

00:00:24.129 --> 00:00:29.210
I didn't realize just how much he made us laugh.

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:59.840
I miss that, it's just more quiet now, but more than that, I felt we were growing apart.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:23.780
I tried talking to him, it didn't go well.

00:01:23.859 --> 00:02:14.430
Ever since I Keele left, things have been off between Karen and I.

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.270
She is so serious now.

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:22.509
I wish he would just lighten up and laugh more.

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:29.580
Like when I Keele was still here, as much as I hated to admit it.

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:38.949
It felt like we were growing apart, even I Keele noticed.

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:42.710
Anyway, could I ask you guys a question?

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.550
Are you both doing okay?

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.110
Because you don't look okay.

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.150
Of course we are okay, okay, we're doing wonderful, right?

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:58.099
Yeah, we're doing good.

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:07.800
We weren't fooling anyone, except maybe ourselves, and for the first time.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:15.000
We both revealed to each other just how we had been really feeling.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.439
We knew we were headed down a dangerous path.

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:25.979
We had to do something, fast.

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:31.740
We read aloud the scripture at Romans 12 and 10,

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:36.939
in showing honor to one another, take the lead.

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:40.139
We thought about Abraham and Sarah.

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:47.139
They weren't perfect, but they worked hard to show honor to each other.

00:03:47.139 --> 00:04:03.150
By listening and by caring, I told Karen, I know I can do better.

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:09.900
And I want to, because I love her so much.

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:18.290
I told Sean, let's both try to do better.

00:04:18.290 --> 00:05:03.800
So we did.

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.240
We decided to pioneer together.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.279
Now, it seemed we had a lot to talk about.

00:05:11.279 --> 00:05:16.470
I felt like I was seeing a whole new side of Kiera.

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:21.389
Like Abraham and Sarah, our marriage wasn't perfect.

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:25.069
There's going to be stressful times.

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.790
But by working hard to apply Bible principles,

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:31.310
we got through that rough patch.

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:34.029
And it drew us even closer together.
