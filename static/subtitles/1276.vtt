00:00:01.229 --> 00:00:08.230
Tim, thanks for reading all the appendix, 1914, a significant year in Bible prophecy.

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:10.230
You understood it, right?

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.230
Well, it's not completely clear.

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.230
Okay, well, let's go through it again.

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.230
If you remember, Luke 21, verse 24,

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.230
said that Jerusalem would be trampled on by the nations

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.230
until the appointed times of the nations are fulfilled.

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.230
Now, we know that began in 607 BCE.

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.229
And in Daniel chapter 4, verse 16,

00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:37.229
it said that seven times would have to pass over it.

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:40.229
And in Revelation 12, verse 6 and 14,

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:46.229
it indicates that three and a half times equals 1,260 days.

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:50.229
So seven times would be 2,520 days.

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:52.229
But, of course, we've got the Bible principle

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:57.229
where numbers 14, verse 34, a day for a year, a day for a year.

00:00:57.229 --> 00:01:02.229
So that 2,520 days would be 2,520 years.

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:10.230
So counting 2,520 years from 607 BCE brings us to 1914

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.230
when Jesus began to rule his king and the heavens.

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:18.859
You've got it now.

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:20.859
It's still not clear.

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:24.859
It's okay. I didn't understand it the first time I went through it.

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:29.859
Just read the appendix a few more times and it will make sense.

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:35.060
Come on, let's finish our study of chapter 8.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.060
So based on what we've been learning in chapter 8,

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.060
can you think of a good reason why it's so important

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.060
that we know when God's kingdom began to rule?

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.060
Well, I think that if you knew when God's kingdom began to rule,

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.060
then you would know that the blessings of the kingdom are soon to follow.

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.060
That's an excellent answer.

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.060
And of course, the appendix here contains the scriptural proof

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.060
of when God's kingdom began to rule in 1914.

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.060
Would you like to read just the first two paragraphs in the appendix there

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.060
under the heading on page 215, 1914,

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.060
a significant year in Bible prophecy?

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.060
Sure. Decades in advance, Bible students proclaim.

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.060
Thank you.

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.060
So notice there that Jesus said that the city of Jerusalem

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.060
would be trampled on by the nations until the appointed times

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.060
of the nations are fulfilled.

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.060
Now for us to understand Jesus' words,

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.060
we have to know why was Jerusalem special?

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.060
What did Jerusalem symbolize?

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.060
So what did we learn about Jerusalem there in paragraph 2?

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.060
Well, Jerusalem is where the Jewish kings ruled, right?

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.060
So they would have ruled for Jehovah,

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.060
which meant that Jerusalem was a symbol of Jehovah's rulership.

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.060
Very good.

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:05.060
Now you have the key to understanding when Jesus began to rule his king.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.060
Wow. This is really interesting.

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.060
It's like solving a mystery, isn't it?

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.060
Let's read the next paragraph.
