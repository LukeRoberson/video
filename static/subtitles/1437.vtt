00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:12.740
At our convention, they had the meeting for the School for Kingdom of Angelizers.

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.740
My friend Anton asked if I was going to go.

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:17.739
Thank you, Bill.

00:00:17.739 --> 00:00:18.739
Oh, hey, Anton.

00:00:18.739 --> 00:00:19.739
Are you coming?

00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:20.739
To what?

00:00:20.739 --> 00:00:21.739
The ESK meeting.

00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:24.739
Oh, no, I wasn't planning on it.

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:25.739
But...

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:26.739
All right.

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:27.739
Yeah, sure.

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:28.739
I'll go.

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:29.739
Okay, then.

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:33.070
I left over a second.

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.070
I went, but I felt conflicted.

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.070
I thought...

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.070
I already have an assignment, one that I love.

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.070
But I didn't fully understand the incredible privilege of attending ESK.

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:53.149
I asked the circuit officer a few more questions, and it felt like...

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:55.149
This is it.

00:00:55.149 --> 00:01:00.149
It seemed right, and all I had to do was apply online.

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.149
But...

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:04.150
That was months ago.

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.150
Saw us folding you back.

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.150
I feel like Jehovah led me here, and I've never been happier.

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.150
But now another door's opened, and...

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.150
The fear's back.

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:22.150
It doesn't matter how far you've come, fear of the unknown could be overwhelming.

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.150
Sometimes you need a reminder that Jehovah's leading you in the right direction.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.150
Here's one to keep in mind.

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.150
Philippians 4, 13.

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:33.150
Read it.

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:46.760
And just think about how far Jehovah's taking you.

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.760
For all things, I have the strength...

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.760
Through the one who gives me pride.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:14.430
Jehovah is in control.

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:31.439
What was I so afraid of?

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:32.439
I'm bringing too much.

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:36.330
ESK is for two months.

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.330
Oh, you would just delight you too.

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.330
Bringing every last thing with you.

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.949
Can I?

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:46.949
Can I leave this with you?

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:50.949
It's been on a few adventures, but it's still great for travel.

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:51.949
Really?

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:53.949
Yeah, please.

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:56.949
Who knows you might need it sometimes, too.
