00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:09.949
Okay, Jean, the last review question is how can Jesus' death benefit you?

00:00:09.949 --> 00:00:17.839
I suppose I should say that it means forgiveness for my sins, but God's not going to forgive me.

00:00:17.839 --> 00:00:19.839
What makes you feel that way?

00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:21.839
I don't feel, I know.

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:24.839
I made better choices in my business than I did at home.

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:27.280
Sorry.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:33.579
Jean, scroll down to where it says, explore.

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:38.579
And click under, can Jehovah forgive even serious sins?

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.579
Okay, got it.

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:42.579
Can you read the second paragraph, please?

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:44.579
Sure.

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:51.579
Some people have committed gross sins and wonder whether God can forgive them.

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:58.579
Happily, the Word of God says the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from all sin.

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:05.579
Jehovah willingly forgives even serious sins if we have a proper repentance attitude.

00:01:05.579 --> 00:01:09.579
The blood of Jesus cleanses us from all sin.

00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:16.579
Through the ransom, Jehovah forgives our sins, even serious ones, and he draws us to them.

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:20.579
But Ron, why should anyone get a free pass?

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:22.579
Because it's not free.

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:25.579
Do you see the scripture link to Isaiah chapter 1, verse 18?

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:26.579
I see it.

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:28.579
Can you read it, please?

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:32.579
Come now and let us set matter straight between us, says Jehovah.

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.579
Though your sins are like scarlet, they will be made as white as snow.

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:42.579
Though they are as red as crimson cloth, they will become like wool.

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:49.579
So forgiveness of our sins is possible if we set matter straight.

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:53.579
What do you, Jean, think that means?

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:59.140
I need to do what's right.

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.140
I'm trying.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.140
Yeah, that's good.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.140
It also involves how we feel.

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.140
We should feel sorry. I am.

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.139
No, that's a good sign, Jean.

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:16.139
Lastly, let Jehovah help you with a step that's the hardest for many of us.

00:02:16.139 --> 00:02:20.539
He can help you forgive yourself.

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:26.479
Jesus died for me.

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:34.219
Ron, I think I'm going to need a little more time to process this.

00:02:34.219 --> 00:02:36.219
We all do.

00:02:36.219 --> 00:02:39.469
Let's go ahead and conclude with a prayer.

00:02:39.469 --> 00:02:46.469
And we'll specifically ask Jehovah to strengthen your faith in the ransom and his forgiveness.

00:02:46.469 --> 00:02:51.719
Later, when you pray, you can beg him for the same thing.

00:02:51.719 --> 00:02:53.719
Thank you.

00:02:53.719 --> 00:02:57.060
Okay, I'll say a prayer.
