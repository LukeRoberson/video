00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:04.500
Christian families try hard to follow the lead of God's spirit

00:00:04.599 --> 00:00:07.200
in all aspects of life.

00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:08.900
A serious health condition, though,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.099
can cause us to question whether we have the strength

00:00:11.199 --> 00:00:14.099
of God's spirit to endure.

00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:17.399
Our team interviewed Felicity Sneesby and her parents.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.399
Their trusting God's power through the Holy Spirit

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:30.260
can encourage any who face an ongoing test of faith.

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:31.960
Once for only when I got married,

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.060
we had hopes and dreams for the future.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:37.560
We knew that not only our marriage,

00:00:37.659 --> 00:00:39.060
but also the raising of our children

00:00:39.159 --> 00:00:41.560
would be special because we had Jehovah.

00:00:41.659 --> 00:00:43.759
And we were so excited when we found out

00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:45.759
we were having our second child.

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:49.659
Ben and I went for our routine 20-week ultrasound.

00:00:49.759 --> 00:00:52.960
We could see little hands moving.

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.560
Beautiful little face.

00:00:55.659 --> 00:00:57.060
We found out at that ultrasound

00:00:57.159 --> 00:00:59.659
that our baby was going to die when she was born

00:00:59.759 --> 00:01:03.399
because she only had half a heart.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.099
We were devastated. We were so sad.

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.299
It was almost like a mini goodbye.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.700
The doctor told us there was no chance in Australia

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:13.900
that she could be upgraded on.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.500
We had to look at getting a surgeon elsewhere

00:01:16.599 --> 00:01:19.299
and we found one in the United States.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.700
When we moved to America, we knew nobody.

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:22.900
And in the very first day,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.900
70 brothers and sisters came to see us.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.200
We knew that day that we were going to be okay,

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:32.140
that Jehovah was going to take care of us.

00:01:32.239 --> 00:01:34.140
Despite one of the trials and challenges

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.040
that we faced, 22 heart surgery.

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.040
12 years later,

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:45.129
we have a beautiful daughter, her name is Felicity.

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:49.329
Mama dad is really good at helping us set goals

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.329
and fulfill our goals.

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.230
We have told Felicity for her whole life

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.829
that she's able to do whatever she wants to do.

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.230
She may not be able to do as quick as other people

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:01.030
or for as long as other people,

00:02:01.129 --> 00:02:08.250
but there's nothing that she can't accomplish.

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:10.750
She set a goal to become an unbacked-sized publisher

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.349
when she was very young.

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:14.650
She set a goal then to become back-toised.

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.949
Straight away, as soon as she became back-toised,

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.050
she said, I want to exhilarate pioneer.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.750
I wanted to pioneer because I knew I was going to give my all

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:24.949
to Jehovah.

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.050
When I got accepted as a regular pioneer,

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.349
I was really, really excited.

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:34.949
I'm encouraging others because it makes me feel good.

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:40.550
It helps me to not draw all the attention

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.449
to me, but to draw the attention to others.

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.449
In my recent years, I developed another condition

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.449
called protein-losing enteropathy,

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.949
but then in desire, I don't have enough energy

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.750
to run and jump like my sisters.

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:55.750
At least when we're really weak

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:57.750
and sometimes I need a wheelchair to walk.

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:04.389
I love family warships so much

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:06.590
because we get to sit down as a family

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:09.189
and practice some kingdom songs,

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:12.689
read a Bible story or watch the broadcast for the month.

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.560
I love fishing, having barbecues on the beach

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:21.560
and having hospitality,

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:30.840
so I love doing that with my family.

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:33.039
In the last six years,

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:36.139
we've nearly lost publicity four times.

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:37.740
As a mother, I've always found it necessary

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.639
just to maintain a positive attitude.

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.439
I've always tried to not feel well with me.

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:44.840
Why did this have to happen to me,

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:47.840
but just to keep a good frame of mind

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:55.900
it helped me to cope.

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.800
We're often taught at meetings to rely heavily upon Jehovah.

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.800
And it's all well and good to say that.

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.800
But when it comes to crunch time,

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:05.800
it can be really high.

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.300
But we've learned through our experiences

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.800
that if we respond to scriptures

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.800
such as Psalms 55, 22,

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.800
where it says to throw our burdens on Jehovah,

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.300
not hand them to him,

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:19.100
but throw them to him,

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:22.399
then he will sustain us through our hardest times.

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.600
One thing that really encouraged us during all of the time

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.199
that we've had medical problems,

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.500
was that we never isolated ourselves from Jehovah's organization.

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.500
We took advantage of all of the provisions

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.300
that he'd get in office to us.

00:04:34.399 --> 00:04:36.300
We've got the hospital liaison committee,

00:04:36.399 --> 00:04:38.500
the patient visitation elders.

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.500
A lot of the hospitality that we've been showing over the years

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.899
is actually really trained better than I to make sure

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.199
that we always extend that same spirit of hospitality

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:47.500
to other people.

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:53.500
When I'm doing my personal study

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.000
and I see a picture of paradise,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.399
I imagine myself there.

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.800
I'm looking forward to getting 100% health

00:04:59.899 --> 00:05:03.899
second, walk the dog, ride the horses,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.480
ride my bike, and run.

00:05:09.579 --> 00:05:18.579
I'm like everybody else, and I love serving Jehovah.

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.680
Jehovah is more powerful than my health problem,

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:26.060
and I know that he can fix it.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.060
Felicity and her family have turned their trial

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:33.060
into an opportunity to build complete confidence in Jehovah.

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.060
One of Felicity's favorite scriptures,

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:39.959
Isaiah 4110, assures her that Jehovah will hold on to her

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:43.459
with his right hand of righteousness.

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.160
By the regular worship together,

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:48.259
her family maintains their strong faith.

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:51.259
That worship includes a full ministry

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.660
where 12-year-old Felicity has already been pioneering

00:05:54.759 --> 00:05:56.759
for over a year with her parents.
