00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:07.200
which is worse, to stumble others or to be stumbled.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:15.199
From Jehovah's viewpoint, both are serious matters that can affect our lives and also the lives of others.

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:24.199
But today we're going to focus on the matter of being stumbled because our texturges us do not be quick to take offense.

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:27.199
James chapter 3 verse 2 warns us,

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:30.199
we all stumble many times.

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:35.200
We don't want to misunderstand these words to say it's okay to be stumbled.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.200
It's not providing an excuse.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.200
Rather, James simply stated a reality of our imperfect lives.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:51.200
What the important thing then is what do we do when we run into a potential stumbling block?

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.200
Proverbs chapter 24 verse 16 tells us,

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:01.200
the righteous one may fall even seven times and he will certainly get up.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:08.200
Let's consider what might cause us to stumble and how we can avoid being stumbled.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.200
Some causes of stumbling are injustices on the part of our fellow believers.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:19.200
It could be persecution or tribulation or it may be the imperfections of others.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:26.200
Any one of these obstacles could cause us to trip to stumble or even to fall down.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:36.200
How can we prevent these stumbling blocks from turning into roadblocks that stop our forward movement in Jehovah's service?

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.200
Please open your Bibles to Psalm 119.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.200
We'll read verse 165.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:51.200
This scripture provides a simple answer to that question and it also assures us that we can avoid being stumbled.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.200
Psalm 119 verse 165.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.200
Abundant peace belongs to those who love your law.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.200
Nothing can make them stumble.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.200
Why not?

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:12.199
Because if we love Jehovah's law, Jehovah will not allow us to be stumbled.

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:19.199
Our deep love for him and for his law will prevent that from happening.

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:24.199
Some of the most common stumbling blocks result from the imperfections of others.

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:32.199
I'd like to reflect on two experiences that illustrate how we can avoid letting such problems become a permanent stumbling block.

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:36.199
The first experience is Sister Goldie Ramotion.

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:39.199
She was born in Romania in 1903.

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:42.199
She was baptized in 1918.

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:46.199
In 1921 she emigrated to the United States in that same year.

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:49.199
She married a Romanian brother from her hometown.

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:53.199
They settled in Akron, Ohio and had four daughters.

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:59.199
In the mid 1930s, Goldie and her husband were stumbled.

00:02:59.199 --> 00:03:07.199
Listen to Goldie as she explains why they were stumbled and what helped them to regain their balance.

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:09.199
She related.

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:11.199
I became angry with brother Rutherford.

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:16.199
A new witness felt that brother Rutherford had dealt unjustly with him, not hearing him out.

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:19.199
I felt that brother Rutherford was wrong.

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:23.199
Well, one Sunday my sister Mary and her husband Dan came to visit us.

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:28.199
After dinner Dan said, let's get ready to go to meeting.

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:30.199
We don't go to meetings anymore.

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:33.199
I said, we're mad at brother Rutherford.

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:37.199
Dan asked, did you know brother Rutherford when you got baptized?

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:41.199
Of course not, I replied. You know I got baptized in Romania.

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:44.199
Well, why did you get baptized, he asked?

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:47.199
Because I learned that Jehovah is the true God.

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:51.199
And I wanted to dedicate my life to serve him, I answered.

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:54.199
Never forget that, Dan replied.

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:57.199
What if brother Rutherford left the truth?

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:58.199
Would you leave too?

00:03:58.199 --> 00:04:01.199
Never, never, I said.

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:03.199
And that brought me to my senses.

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:07.199
And I said, everybody, get ready for meeting.

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:09.199
And we haven't stopped since.

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:12.199
Jehovah continued to bless Goldie and her family.

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:17.199
For example, her daughter Beth graduated from the 14th class of Gilead.

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:23.199
The moving account of Goldie's life story can be found in the April 1st, 1997.

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:26.199
Issue of the Watch Tower.

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:28.199
By all means, go back and read it.

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:33.199
You will not only be encouraged, but you'll also learn how she got the name Goldie.

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:35.199
Is there a lesson here for us?

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:43.199
Yes. Goldie and her family avoided permanent stumbling by staying focused on the big picture.

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:49.199
That is, Jehovah's sovereignty and their personal relationship with him.

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:52.199
Now let's consider a second experience.

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:59.199
When I read the text for today, I immediately thought of brother Adolf Weber.

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:05.199
I first read his experience 38 years ago in the 1980 year book.

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:11.540
Obviously, his experience made a lasting impression on my mind and heart.

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:15.540
Adolf Weber was a Swiss woodcutter. His job was cutting down trees.

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:19.540
In the mid-1890s, he traveled to the United States.

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:26.540
He worked as a part-time gardener for Brother Russell, and that's how he came to learn the deep truths of God's word.

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:29.540
Brother Weber was fluent in English, German, and French.

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:35.540
He volunteered to return to Europe to cultivate the French-speaking field and Brother Russell agreed.

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:42.540
Brother Weber went to his hometown in Switzerland, and there he placed ads in French religious newspapers

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:45.540
and found an excellent response to those ads.

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:54.540
Then in 1903, Brother Russell visited Europe and arranged with Brother Weber to publish an eight-page French edition of the Watch Tower.

00:05:54.540 --> 00:06:01.540
And like a zealous regular pioneer, in the summer, Brother Weber worked as a woodcutter and a gardener in Switzerland,

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:09.540
and then he would travel to France and to Belgium to follow up on interested ones who had responded to his newspaper ads.

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:18.540
He traveled extensively and gave general oversight to the work in this French-speaking field in Europe for over 12 years.

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:30.540
Then in 1912, Brother Russell visited Europe again, and he appointed a new brother who was better educated than Brother Weber to be in charge of the work.

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:33.540
Do you see a potential stumbling block?

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:34.540
Absolutely.

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:38.540
But Brother Weber didn't even flinch.

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:43.540
He humbly stepped down and was happy to do whatever he could to advance Kingdom interest.

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:53.540
Interestingly, that better educated brother who replaced Brother Weber eventually left the truth, and so did four others who succeeded him.

00:06:53.540 --> 00:07:03.540
But through all of this, Brother Weber humbly kept on doing what he had done for years, spreading seeds of truth to honest-hearted ones in the field.

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:07.540
Is there a lesson here for us? Certainly.

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:12.540
Please open your Bibles to Matthew chapter 23, and we'll read verse 12.

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:25.540
This scripture identifies an outstanding quality of Brother Weber, and notice the results of showing this quality, Matthew chapter 23 verse 12.

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:34.540
Whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:53.540
How true this proved to be in Brother Weber's case. Brother Weber was never looking for recognition, and yet his experience appears in the Proclaimers book in the 1980-year book, the 1984-year book, and the 1987-year book, because of all that good work he did in Europe.

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:59.540
The 1987-year book gave this meaningful summary of Brother Weber's life.

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:05.540
It said those some had allowed feelings of self-importance to overreach them.

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:16.540
Brother Weber continued to serve Jehovah loyally and humbly. His modesty, strong faith and zealous service, left a deep impression on all who knew him.

00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:24.540
Finally, at the age of 85, he finished his earthly course in February 1948.

00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:32.539
What a fitting tribute to this humble servant of Jehovah who was not quick to take offense.

00:08:33.539 --> 00:08:47.539
So may we be like Brother Weber and Sister Romotion. Let's maintain a humble modest view of ourselves and stay focused on building a close relationship with Jehovah.

00:08:47.539 --> 00:08:55.539
If we do this, we will not be quick to take offense, and nothing will make us stumble.
