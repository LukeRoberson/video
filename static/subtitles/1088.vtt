00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:07.809
This 2020 convention is being broadcast in 240 lands.

00:00:07.809 --> 00:00:14.810
We anticipate over 14 million individuals will be able to enjoy this program by this means.

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:18.809
Your generous donations make this possible.

00:00:18.809 --> 00:00:24.809
Donations can be made online at donate.jw.org.

00:00:24.809 --> 00:00:25.809
You may be seated.

00:00:25.809 --> 00:00:31.789
No doubt you enjoy examining Jehovah's creations.

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:36.789
What can creation teach us about Jehovah and about finding joy?

00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:38.789
How can we apply what we learn?

00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:43.789
Take note of the lessons in the upcoming six-part symposium.

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:46.789
Each speaker will introduce the one to follow.

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:52.789
Brother Joel Dellinger, a helper to the service committee will deliver the first talk entitled

00:00:52.789 --> 00:01:05.640
Creation proves that Jehovah wants us to rejoice, exquisite flowers.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.640
Are you convinced that Jehovah wants you to rejoice?

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.640
We have many reasons to believe that.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.640
Creation is one such proof.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:25.640
In the beginning, the Bible teaches that Jehovah worked very hard to make our home a delightful place to live here on Planet Earth.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:31.640
This included his creating millions of different species of plants and animals.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:37.640
And when he finished with all this amazing activity, do you know what our creator did next?

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:44.640
At the end of the sixth creative day, the Bible tells us at Genesis 1 and verse 31,

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:51.640
God saw everything he had made, and look, it was very good.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.640
Think about that.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.640
After working hard over perhaps the course of thousands of years, our Father paused.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:07.640
He inspected everything, and then he rejoiced in all that he had made.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:17.639
Brothers and sisters, the beauty and wisdom in creation proves that our Heavenly Father wants us to enjoy life on Planet Earth.

00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:23.639
In fact, he wants us to join him in rejoicing over all that he has made.

00:02:23.639 --> 00:02:26.639
But how can we do that?

00:02:26.639 --> 00:02:31.639
The Bible gives us a clue at Psalm 111 and verse 2.

00:02:31.639 --> 00:02:39.639
I invite you, please, to open your Bible and read along with all of us, Psalm 111, verse 2.

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:41.639
It says,

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:43.639
The works of Jehovah are great.

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:49.639
They are studied by all those finding pleasure in them.

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:58.639
We see clearly in the Bible that Jehovah invites us to look closely at the things he has made so that we can learn from them,

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:02.639
and doing so is a delightful experience.

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:04.639
So let's do that together.

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:14.639
In this symposium, we will examine six of Jehovah's many works and our God-given ability to enjoy them all.

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:18.639
First, we'll focus our attention on exquisite flowers.

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:24.639
Then our next speaker will talk about one of our favorite things, delicious food.

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:34.639
Next, we will discuss beautiful colors, our well-designed bodies, delightful sounds, and lastly fascinating animals.

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:45.639
Each talk in this series will also teach us scriptural lessons from creation that can help us rejoice in life even now in these difficult last days.

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:48.639
Well, are you as ready as I am?

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:52.639
Let's start by looking closely at exquisite flowers.

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:57.639
In the following video, I invite you to look for the answers to these three questions.

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:02.639
First, how many species of flowering plants are there?

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:06.639
Second, what practical needs do flowers serve?

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:12.639
And third, how can flowers help us when we get anxious?

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:17.689
Please enjoy the video.

00:04:17.689 --> 00:04:30.709
The Earth has more than 350,000 species of flowering plants.

00:04:30.709 --> 00:04:35.500
Flowers serve practical needs.

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:43.500
Flowers make pollen in order to reproduce and nectar for creatures that spread pollen.

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:51.750
Pollination produces nutritious seeds, fruits and vegetables.

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:55.750
Beautiful flower we see may look like this to a bee.

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:02.750
Some flowers reflect ultraviolet light in ways that create a hard-to-miss target.

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:08.930
We enjoy more than the flowers' beauty and aroma.

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:14.930
Yet some plants do not need beautiful flowers to reproduce.

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:22.930
Flowers, pollen, nectar, and aromas are costly for plants to produce.

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:26.930
Those resources could be used for other purposes.

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:31.930
Yet plants make flowers in breathtaking abundance.

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:50.910
Jehovah generously created flowers in a way that brings us joy

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:54.910
and reminds us to trust him when we are anxious.

00:05:54.910 --> 00:06:00.930
Take a lesson from the lilies of the field.

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:05.930
How they grow, they do not toil nor do they spin.

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:18.009
But not even Solomon in all his glory was arrayed as one of these.

00:06:18.009 --> 00:06:25.009
Did that video stir within you a desire to get to know Jehovah's creative works even better?

00:06:25.009 --> 00:06:32.009
Jehovah designed us to enjoy the beauty of flowers and their lovely fragrances.

00:06:32.009 --> 00:06:39.009
Can you imagine trying to study all 350,000 species of flowering plants?

00:06:39.009 --> 00:06:47.009
Admiring their beauty, smelling them, and maybe even making a drawing or taking a photo of each one?

00:06:47.009 --> 00:06:54.009
You know, if you started today and spent a little time every day getting to know a different flower,

00:06:54.009 --> 00:07:00.009
your study project would take a little over 958 years.

00:07:00.009 --> 00:07:04.009
It's a good thing we're going to live forever, isn't it?

00:07:04.009 --> 00:07:08.009
But in addition to seeing the beauty in flowers,

00:07:08.009 --> 00:07:13.009
as we've learned in the video, flowers play an important role in our ecosystem.

00:07:13.009 --> 00:07:21.009
Flowers make pollen in order to reproduce and nectar for creatures like the bees that spread pollen.

00:07:21.009 --> 00:07:26.009
In turn, pollination produces nutritious seeds, fruits, and vegetables.

00:07:26.009 --> 00:07:30.009
Thanks to the flowers, we have food to eat.

00:07:30.009 --> 00:07:39.009
And how we marvel at the ingenious design that's evident in all things in creation.

00:07:39.009 --> 00:07:45.009
Many people today enjoy looking at creation, but few realize that when they do so,

00:07:45.009 --> 00:07:52.009
they're actually getting a glimpse into the mind and heart of our loving creator, Jehovah.

00:07:52.009 --> 00:07:54.009
Well, that's not true of us, though, is it?

00:07:54.009 --> 00:07:57.009
Because we know who Jehovah is.

00:07:57.009 --> 00:08:00.009
When we carefully observe all the things he has made,

00:08:00.009 --> 00:08:06.009
we naturally think of him, our drawn closer to him, and to his beautiful qualities.

00:08:06.009 --> 00:08:13.009
At one point in life, the faithful man, Job, was reminded by his friend Elihu to stop

00:08:13.009 --> 00:08:18.009
and consider carefully the wonderful works of God.

00:08:18.009 --> 00:08:21.009
Do you recall how that advice helped Job?

00:08:21.009 --> 00:08:30.009
As Job learned, our joy increases when we're focused on Jehovah and on his works instead of on ourselves.

00:08:30.009 --> 00:08:35.009
Parents and young ones, this is a good lesson for all of us.

00:08:35.009 --> 00:08:40.009
Following the advice given to Job can also draw us closer to Jehovah.

00:08:40.009 --> 00:08:47.009
How much better that is than spending time with much of the world's entertainment that is debased?

00:08:48.009 --> 00:08:54.009
Such pre-packaged entertainment is often designed to turn us away from Jehovah, not draw us closer to him.

00:08:54.009 --> 00:08:59.009
But what about spending time observing Jehovah's works?

00:08:59.009 --> 00:09:04.009
Now that's a wholesome pastime with a future.

00:09:04.009 --> 00:09:11.009
Observing flowers may also bring to our mind another lesson, one that Jesus taught.

00:09:11.009 --> 00:09:18.009
Please open your Bible again to Matthew 6 and we'll read together verses 28 to 30.

00:09:18.009 --> 00:09:22.009
In the reading, look for the answer to the following question.

00:09:22.009 --> 00:09:26.009
How can flowers help us when we get anxious?

00:09:26.009 --> 00:09:30.009
Let's read Matthew 6 verses 28 to 30.

00:09:30.009 --> 00:09:32.009
Jesus said,

00:09:33.009 --> 00:09:36.009
Also, why are you anxious about clothing?

00:09:36.009 --> 00:09:40.009
Take a lesson from the lilies of the field how they grow.

00:09:40.009 --> 00:09:43.009
They do not toil, nor do they spin.

00:09:43.009 --> 00:09:49.009
But I tell you that not even Solomon in all his glory was arrayed as one of these.

00:09:49.009 --> 00:09:56.009
Now if this is how God closed the vegetation of the field that is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven,

00:09:56.009 --> 00:10:01.009
will he not much rather clothe you with little faith?

00:10:01.009 --> 00:10:03.009
How heartwarming.

00:10:03.009 --> 00:10:07.009
Have you ever been anxious about food and clothing?

00:10:07.009 --> 00:10:09.009
If so, you're not alone.

00:10:09.009 --> 00:10:16.009
Among those listening to Jesus on this occasion were many poor people who had the same natural concerns.

00:10:16.009 --> 00:10:24.009
But Jesus encouraged them, how so, by reminding them to take a lesson from the flowers.

00:10:24.009 --> 00:10:26.009
Jesus knew what we know.

00:10:26.009 --> 00:10:35.009
Jehovah generously created flowers in a way that brings us joy and reminds us to trust him when we are anxious.

00:10:35.009 --> 00:10:39.009
When we see how well Jehovah takes care of all the flowers,

00:10:39.009 --> 00:10:45.009
we're reminded of how generous he is and his loving care of humans.

00:10:45.009 --> 00:10:53.009
And like Jehovah, when we give generously to others and help care for their needs when it's within the power of our hand to do so,

00:10:53.009 --> 00:10:58.009
we too will experience the joy that comes from giving.

00:10:58.009 --> 00:11:08.009
Dear ones, may we never forget that it was Jehovah who gave us the ability to appreciate exquisite flowers.

00:11:08.009 --> 00:11:17.009
May doing just that bring you joy and add to your praise of Jehovah forever.

00:11:17.009 --> 00:11:25.009
Now, Brother Ralph Walls, who serves as a helper to the personnel committee, will present the next talk of this symposium.

00:11:25.009 --> 00:11:38.759
Creation proves that Jehovah wants us to rejoice, delicious food, rice and beans.

00:11:38.759 --> 00:11:44.759
You can eat them with just about anything and they will be delicious.

00:11:44.759 --> 00:11:46.759
What about kimchi?

00:11:46.759 --> 00:11:55.759
It's a dish of fermented vegetables with a variety of seasonings, producing a complex taste of sour and spicy.

00:11:55.759 --> 00:11:59.759
And Jehovah's rice? So flavor-some.

00:11:59.759 --> 00:12:07.759
This is cooked in an appetizing tomato and pepper puree, laced with chili for a zesty taste.

00:12:07.759 --> 00:12:15.759
And at the end of a day of hard work, how about a piece of sweet, fruity, cool watermelon?

00:12:15.759 --> 00:12:19.759
It's wonderfully refreshing.

00:12:19.759 --> 00:12:27.759
All over planet earth, there are a vast variety of nutritious, delicious and refreshing foods.

00:12:27.759 --> 00:12:30.759
That is what God has provided.

00:12:30.759 --> 00:12:33.759
It is just as the Bible says.

00:12:33.759 --> 00:12:40.759
Please read along with me at Ecclesiastes chapter 3, verses 12 and 13.

00:12:41.759 --> 00:12:50.009
I have concluded that there is nothing better for them than to rejoice and to do good during their life.

00:12:50.009 --> 00:12:59.009
Also that everyone should eat and drink and find enjoyment for all his hard work.

00:12:59.009 --> 00:13:03.259
It is the gift of God.

00:13:03.259 --> 00:13:06.259
No doubt you enjoy your favorite foods.

00:13:06.259 --> 00:13:10.259
Your mouth may be watering just from thinking about it.

00:13:10.259 --> 00:13:19.259
As much as we enjoy eating individually, when we share a good meal with family and friends, it's a special time.

00:13:19.259 --> 00:13:32.580
In the following video, note how Jehovah's provision of food gives evidence that he wants us to enjoy life.

00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:38.620
Our tongue can detect five basic tastes.

00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:53.529
There is sweet, salty, sour, bitter.

00:13:53.529 --> 00:13:59.830
And the rich savoury taste called umami.

00:13:59.830 --> 00:14:05.830
But we enjoy not just five flavors, but possibly over a hundred thousand.

00:14:05.830 --> 00:14:10.389
How?

00:14:10.389 --> 00:14:16.149
As we chew, we also smell our food.

00:14:16.149 --> 00:14:23.149
Chewing releases aromas that pass up into our nose through the back of our throat.

00:14:23.149 --> 00:14:28.149
Taste and smell then combine to make the flavors we enjoy.

00:14:28.149 --> 00:14:39.789
Our taste buds develop before we're born.

00:14:39.789 --> 00:14:47.070
As an unborn baby swallows amniotic fluid, it may taste what its mother eats.

00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:52.860
And it's more likely to enjoy the same food she does.

00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:59.490
We don't eat just to survive.

00:14:59.490 --> 00:15:02.490
We love to eat.

00:15:02.490 --> 00:15:12.100
It makes us happy and the Bible says why?

00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:21.850
That everyone should eat and drink and find enjoyment for all his hard work.

00:15:21.850 --> 00:15:31.440
It is the gift of God.

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:37.440
We are made so that we must take in physical food regularly in order to survive.

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:43.440
Yet how grateful we are that our Creator has made eating so enjoyable.

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:47.440
That reflects the way of Jehovah.

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:52.440
Filling our needs creates joy, not dread.

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:57.440
You will not find a normal individual complaining about eating a good dinner.

00:15:57.440 --> 00:16:01.440
No, rather it's enjoyable.

00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:05.440
Now, turn with me, please, to Matthew 4.

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:11.440
And notice another vital need we have that relates to food.

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:15.440
Matthew 4.4

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:17.440
It says,

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:19.440
it is written,

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:22.440
man must live not on bread alone,

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:27.440
but on every word that comes from Jehovah's mouth.

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:32.440
We need physical food to stay alive and we enjoy doing so.

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:36.440
But the same is true with spiritual food.

00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:39.440
We need it to stay alive spiritually.

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:43.440
Also, just as is true with physical food,

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:48.440
when we partake of spiritual food, we find true joy.

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:53.440
Isn't that what Jesus said in his introduction to the sermon on the Mount?

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:59.440
Happy are those conscious of their spiritual need?

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:07.440
The beauty of Jehovah's way is that he has made the satisfying of our spiritual need enjoyable.

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:10.440
Why do we say that?

00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:17.440
Because God's word, the Bible, is written in a way that is appealing to us.

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:22.440
In his great wisdom, he used humans to write the Bible. Think about it.

00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:25.440
If, for example, he had used angels,

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:31.440
would they have been able to convey the emotions and feelings with a human touch?

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:34.440
Words convey not just information,

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:40.440
but emotions such as fear, sorrow, and disappointment.

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:47.440
By allowing imperfect men to choose the wording for the ideas they received through Holy Spirit,

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:56.440
God conveyed his message with warmth, variety, and the appeal of human emotions and feelings.

00:17:56.440 --> 00:18:00.440
That makes his word appealing to us humans.

00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:08.440
In addition to that, Jehovah provides a variety of spiritual food in abundance.

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:17.440
But taking in spiritual food requires effort just as it takes in preparing and eating a delicious meal.

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:25.440
Rice and beans, kimchi, and jolaf rice each take time and effort to prepare.

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:29.440
It takes effort to plant, cultivate, and pick watermelon.

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:34.440
But what a joy it is to experience the results of such efforts.

00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:40.440
What can we do to make the study of God's word more enjoyable?

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:47.440
When reading the Bible, do so allowed in a lively manner.

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:53.440
But when we do that, we experience what Psalm 1 verse 2 says.

00:18:53.440 --> 00:19:04.440
His delight is in the law of Jehovah, and he reads his law in an undertone day and night.

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:08.440
Take time to do research and to meditate.

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:14.440
By being creative, you can make personal study and family study meaningful and satisfying.

00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:21.440
When reading the Bible, imagine the sounds, the sights, the smells,

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:24.440
and the appearance of the events.

00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:30.440
The August 15, 2011 watchtower said,

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:37.440
it is not the intention of the governing body to establish one format for all families.

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:43.440
Since circumstances vary, it is appropriate for each family head or individual

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:48.440
to evaluate how this weekly occasion can be used in the best way.

00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:54.440
In other words, make family and personal worship an enjoyable time.

00:19:54.440 --> 00:20:01.440
It may not always be necessary or even desirable to use a question and answer method.

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:07.440
A relaxed atmosphere is more conducive to a lively and stimulating discussion.

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:10.440
It promotes creative thinking.

00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:14.440
We marvel at Jehovah's love and wisdom.

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:19.440
Not only has he given us life and the means to sustain it,

00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:24.440
but he has also given us the ability to find pleasure in doing so.

00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:32.779
Due to human rulership, many today do not receive adequate amounts of physical food.

00:20:32.779 --> 00:20:38.779
But the day is near when our loving creator will see to it that everyone alive

00:20:38.779 --> 00:20:42.779
will have an abundance of food and drink.

00:20:42.779 --> 00:20:47.779
In the meantime, may all of us deserve Jehovah's love for us

00:20:47.779 --> 00:20:54.779
and enjoy the food and drink that we do have and the abundance of spiritual food.

00:20:54.779 --> 00:21:03.220
With such perfect gifts, we look forward to enjoying life forever.

00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:06.220
Brother Harold Corker, a helper to the publishing committee,

00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:09.220
will now present the next talk of this symposium.

00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:13.220
Creation proves that Jehovah wants us to rejoice.

00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:22.329
Beautiful colors.

00:21:22.329 --> 00:21:29.329
One of the most precious gifts we enjoy as humans is the gift of sight.

00:21:29.329 --> 00:21:36.670
Sight is possible because of the way our eyes and our brain work together.

00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:41.670
The complexity of our eyes and their connectivity with our brain

00:21:41.670 --> 00:21:46.670
gives strong evidence of a very wise designer.

00:21:46.670 --> 00:21:51.670
And that designer is clearly identified for us in the Bible.

00:21:51.670 --> 00:21:59.670
Please open your Bibles to the Book of Psalms and we're going to look at Psalm 94 verse 9.

00:21:59.670 --> 00:22:01.670
It reads this way,

00:22:01.670 --> 00:22:05.670
The one who made the ear, can he not hear?

00:22:05.670 --> 00:22:10.670
The one who formed the eye, can he not see?

00:22:11.670 --> 00:22:17.670
So Jehovah created the eye and our ability to see and we're very grateful for that.

00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:21.670
But he didn't make it just though that we see in one color

00:22:21.670 --> 00:22:26.670
just so that we can move around and work and function safely and efficiently.

00:22:26.670 --> 00:22:33.670
He gave us the ability to see a wide variety of colors that enrich our lives.

00:22:33.670 --> 00:22:39.670
We very much appreciate the brilliant colors of butterflies, birds, fishes and flowers.

00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:43.950
What is your favorite color?

00:22:43.950 --> 00:22:47.950
Is it red, blue, green?

00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:51.950
Or you may say you've only given me three choices.

00:22:51.950 --> 00:22:53.950
That's true.

00:22:53.950 --> 00:22:57.950
How many color possibilities are there that we can see?

00:22:57.950 --> 00:23:03.950
And how do our eyes and our brain work together to produce this variety of colors?

00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:08.950
And what role does light play in this process?

00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:11.950
These questions will be answered in the following video

00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:17.950
and please take note how all of this wonderful design by Jehovah reassures us

00:23:17.950 --> 00:23:20.950
that our Creator wants us to rejoice.

00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:24.839
What is color?

00:23:24.839 --> 00:23:32.069
It's how we perceive wavelengths of light.

00:23:32.069 --> 00:23:42.859
Objects that reflect all the wavelengths of visible light appear white.

00:23:42.859 --> 00:23:47.859
When an object reflects only some wavelengths, we see color.

00:23:50.619 --> 00:23:56.619
Cells in our eye detect light and send signals to our brain.

00:23:56.619 --> 00:24:01.619
We have three kinds of color sensing cells.

00:24:01.619 --> 00:24:10.819
Those that detect red, green and blue.

00:24:10.819 --> 00:24:14.819
How do we perceive other colors?

00:24:14.819 --> 00:24:20.819
Mixing red, green and blue light changes the color we see.

00:24:20.819 --> 00:24:31.059
This flower is yellow because it reflects red and green light into our eye.

00:24:31.059 --> 00:24:38.059
With just three kinds of color receptors, we can distinguish some 10 million colors.

00:24:38.059 --> 00:24:45.000
Color triggers our emotions.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:49.000
Blue and green can calm us.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:53.000
Red and orange can excite.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:58.000
In the Bible, descriptions that include color help us learn.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:04.000
Is there any doubt that God gave us the gift of color for our joy?

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:16.460
I put my rainbow in the cloud and it will serve as a sign of the covenant between me and the earth.

00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:29.859
How grateful we are that Jehovah gave us this ability to see a variety of colors.

00:25:29.859 --> 00:25:33.859
And color has an impact on our emotions.

00:25:33.859 --> 00:25:36.859
For example, the color red.

00:25:36.859 --> 00:25:42.859
It's a very high visible color and it's filled with energy.

00:25:42.859 --> 00:25:45.859
Sometimes it's associated with danger.

00:25:45.859 --> 00:25:52.859
And red it said can actually make us breathe faster and even raise our blood pressure.

00:25:52.859 --> 00:25:56.859
But on the other hand, green is a very calming color.

00:25:56.859 --> 00:25:58.859
It's very tranquil.

00:25:58.859 --> 00:26:03.859
And that's why when we look at a beautiful green garden or beautiful hillside,

00:26:03.859 --> 00:26:07.859
why we feel very relaxed.

00:26:07.859 --> 00:26:10.859
Besides affecting our emotions,

00:26:10.859 --> 00:26:16.859
Jehovah has used color in the scriptures to teach us Bible truths

00:26:16.859 --> 00:26:20.859
and to help us remember them, to illustrate.

00:26:20.859 --> 00:26:24.859
What do you think of when I mentioned the following?

00:26:24.859 --> 00:26:31.859
A white horse, a red horse, a black horse, a pale horse.

00:26:31.859 --> 00:26:35.859
Well right away your minds went to the book of Revelation, didn't they?

00:26:35.859 --> 00:26:40.859
And you understand what these four horses picture.

00:26:40.859 --> 00:26:47.859
The white horse pictures Jesus Christ as the enthroned king riding in righteous warfare.

00:26:47.859 --> 00:26:53.859
The red horse picturing the bloody warfare among the nations in these last days.

00:26:54.859 --> 00:27:02.859
The black horse, Stark famine and the pale horse, we're quite familiar with these days, aren't we?

00:27:02.859 --> 00:27:09.859
Pale horse pictures dreaded disease at pandemics leading to death.

00:27:09.859 --> 00:27:18.140
So we see how Jehovah used color to teach us Bible truths and to help us remember them.

00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:24.140
There's another way that Jehovah has used scriptures and color to teach us about him.

00:27:24.140 --> 00:27:29.140
An example of this is an Ezekiel chapter 1 verses 26 through 28,

00:27:29.140 --> 00:27:36.140
where Jehovah gives Ezekiel a beautiful, brilliant view of his throne.

00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:41.140
And among all this glory, there is a beautiful rainbow.

00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:44.140
And what does a rainbow picture?

00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:52.140
The rainbow denotes peacefulness, calmness, tranquility, indicating what?

00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:58.140
That with all of his dynamic energy, Jehovah is a calm, peaceful God.

00:27:58.140 --> 00:28:04.670
And that's very reassuring to us and we are endeared to him.

00:28:04.670 --> 00:28:09.670
Now, earlier, we talked about the association of light with color.

00:28:09.670 --> 00:28:18.670
And in the scriptures, Jehovah uses light to depict something about how he increases our understanding of Bible truths.

00:28:18.670 --> 00:28:21.670
At Proverbs 418, the Bible says,

00:28:21.670 --> 00:28:30.670
But the path of the righteous is like the bright morning light that grows brighter and brighter until full daylight.

00:28:30.670 --> 00:28:35.670
Now, this applies spiritually, but we can understand it literally, can't we?

00:28:35.670 --> 00:28:42.670
If you're taking an early morning walk in a countryside and the sun has not come up yet, you can see things,

00:28:42.670 --> 00:28:44.670
but you're not quite sure what you see.

00:28:44.670 --> 00:28:47.670
It props you don't even know what color they are.

00:28:47.670 --> 00:28:51.670
But when the sun comes up, well, you see clearly what you were looking at.

00:28:51.670 --> 00:28:57.670
A beautiful white fence, a green pasture, and a big, stately red barn in the distance.

00:28:57.670 --> 00:29:01.670
And now your appreciation for your walk has been enhanced.

00:29:01.670 --> 00:29:07.670
Well, likewise, the Bible tells us at Sec. Corinthians 4.6

00:29:07.670 --> 00:29:16.670
Let the light shine out of darkness, and he has shown on our hearts to illuminate them with the glorious knowledge of God.

00:29:17.670 --> 00:29:27.670
Jehovah provides his servants with spiritual lightenment, and that helps us to understand and deeply appreciate Bible truths even more.

00:29:27.670 --> 00:29:36.670
And as a result, we understand them, we're motivated to apply them, and it draws us closer to our Heavenly Father.

00:29:36.670 --> 00:29:42.670
Well, how thankful we are that Jehovah created us with the ability to see color.

00:29:43.670 --> 00:29:52.670
It enriches our lives, touches our emotions, helps us to learn and remember Bible truths, helps us to understand our Heavenly Father better,

00:29:52.670 --> 00:29:59.670
and the light that He provides gives us a progressive improvement in our Bible understanding.

00:29:59.670 --> 00:30:04.670
How thankful we are for the gift that Jehovah has given us to see color.

00:30:04.670 --> 00:30:10.670
It is a strong evidence that He really wants us to enjoy life to the full.

00:30:10.670 --> 00:30:20.400
And now, let's give our attention to Brother Robert Lucioni, who will now present the next talk of this symposium.

00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:26.400
Creation proves that Jehovah wants us to rejoice our well-designed bodies.

00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:45.089
Our previous parts have reminded us that Jehovah's creation of flowers and food and colors all demonstrate that Jehovah wants us to be happy, to be joyful.

00:30:45.089 --> 00:30:53.089
Well, in this part, we're going to see that Jehovah designed our bodies in a way that shows that He wants us to be happy as well.

00:30:53.089 --> 00:30:58.089
Now, Jehovah designed us with the amazing capacity for motion.

00:30:58.089 --> 00:31:02.089
A humans can walk, we can run, we can swim, we can dance.

00:31:02.089 --> 00:31:11.089
In fact, if you turn in your Bibles to Acts chapter 17 and verse 28, you will see that this is a God-given ability.

00:31:11.089 --> 00:31:15.089
Acts chapter 17, verse 28,

00:31:15.089 --> 00:31:21.089
For by Him we have life and move and exist.

00:31:21.089 --> 00:31:27.089
This word here move refers to the ability from Jehovah for us to be active.

00:31:27.089 --> 00:31:30.089
But with that in mind, we have two questions.

00:31:30.089 --> 00:31:38.089
One is, are there lessons that we can learn from how Jehovah designed us that can help us to rejoice?

00:31:38.089 --> 00:31:44.089
And number two, are there lessons that we can learn that can help us in our worship of Jehovah?

00:31:44.089 --> 00:31:47.089
Well, let's consider those two points.

00:31:47.089 --> 00:31:58.059
But first, let's watch the following video that will help us appreciate the marvelous way in which we were designed.

00:31:58.059 --> 00:32:06.859
Our bodies are designed to move.

00:32:06.859 --> 00:32:16.430
The way we move can be complex or precise.

00:32:16.430 --> 00:32:24.849
It could require strength or stamina.

00:32:24.849 --> 00:32:35.000
Walking involves the coordination of dozens of muscles.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:39.000
Muscles are controlled by our brain and nervous system.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:43.000
They support and move our bones.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:51.680
And are powered by the food we eat and the oxygen we breathe.

00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:55.680
Everybody part is a marvel of engineering.

00:32:55.680 --> 00:33:05.859
The knee is designed to withstand repeated impact.

00:33:05.859 --> 00:33:12.680
Surrounding tissue cushions and aligns it.

00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:18.680
Finding suggests that regular movement helps prevent joint damage.

00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:28.079
The body is a machine that strengthens as we use it.

00:33:28.079 --> 00:33:32.079
Movement helps us to stay healthy and feel good.

00:33:32.079 --> 00:33:39.480
The body is a credit to its creator.

00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:50.960
For by him, we have life and move and exist.

00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:56.960
The makeup of the human body proves that Jehovah wants us not just to exist, but to be happy.

00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:58.960
But do you remember our first question?

00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:00.960
What lessons can we learn?

00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:02.960
Well, there's two of them.

00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:07.960
One, as the video highlighted, Jehovah designed our bodies to move.

00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:09.960
Did you note the comment?

00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:13.960
The movement helps us stay healthy and feel good.

00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:21.960
Research has established that leading a physically active life can help us to think clearly, to feel happier.

00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:24.960
Have more energy. Be more productive.

00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:26.960
What an incredible gift from Jehovah.

00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:29.960
He created us to move.

00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:38.960
And also, he created us in a way that the more we move, the more we exercise, we work, we do things for others, the happier we are.

00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:46.960
And the second point is that Jehovah designed our bodies with many different parts, but to work as one unit.

00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:49.960
Did you notice the coordination needed just to walk?

00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:51.960
Something we take for granted.

00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:53.960
And what about our knee?

00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:56.960
Can you imagine if our knee did not work in harmony with the rest of the body?

00:34:56.960 --> 00:35:00.960
What if every time we stood up, we weren't sure which way it would bend?

00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:03.960
How complicated that would be.

00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:08.960
But no, Jehovah created our bodies to work as one complete unit.

00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:18.960
And did you notice also the video stated that our body is like a machine with many different moving parts, but it all works together.

00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:25.960
But a unique difference between a machine and our body is that our body strengthens as we use it.

00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:32.960
Now, you think about that. If you go out and you buy a car, you buy a bicycle, you may think that's a successful purchase.

00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:41.960
If it operates as intended, but you would never expect that car or bicycle to improve and go stronger every time you use it.

00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:43.960
But that's what happens to our body.

00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:49.960
And that allows us to exercise, walk, run, swim, dance, even more.

00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:53.960
And the more we move, the happier we are.

00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:55.960
What an incredible design.

00:35:55.960 --> 00:36:00.960
How we appreciate our bodies is wonderful gift from Jehovah.

00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:03.960
But remember our second question.

00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:10.960
Are there lessons that we can learn from the body that can help us to be happy in our worship of Jehovah?

00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:13.960
Well, let's consider those same two points again.

00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:17.960
Remember we said that Jehovah designed our bodies to move.

00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:19.960
So what should we do?

00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:26.369
Well, let's look together to 1 Corinthians chapter 15 and verse 58.

00:36:26.369 --> 00:36:28.369
1 Corinthians 15, 58.

00:36:28.369 --> 00:36:37.369
It says, therefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast and movable always having plenty to do in the work of the Lord,

00:36:37.369 --> 00:36:41.369
knowing that your labor is not in vain in connection with the Lord.

00:36:41.369 --> 00:36:43.369
So what do we need to do?

00:36:43.369 --> 00:36:48.369
Move, stay busy, have plenty to do in the work of the Lord.

00:36:48.369 --> 00:36:54.369
And Jehovah gave us further reason for rejoicing by giving us meaningful work to do.

00:36:54.369 --> 00:37:01.369
Now, many of you dear brothers and sisters have said that you've never felt busier than you do now.

00:37:01.369 --> 00:37:03.369
Do you think that's a coincidence?

00:37:03.369 --> 00:37:08.369
Do you think it's a coincidence that the darker and more depressing these last days have become

00:37:08.369 --> 00:37:11.369
that you are busier than ever in Jehovah's work?

00:37:11.369 --> 00:37:12.369
No!

00:37:12.369 --> 00:37:20.369
See, that is one of the ways that Jehovah uses to help us to be happy and healthy in these last days.

00:37:20.369 --> 00:37:25.369
Now, we know that our primary work is that of preaching the good news of the kingdom.

00:37:25.369 --> 00:37:31.369
And we do that through the house to house preaching work, we do that through public witnessing, through Bible studies.

00:37:31.369 --> 00:37:38.369
But even when this work is restricted due to world events, we still find ways to preach.

00:37:38.369 --> 00:37:49.369
And when we have plenty to do in the work of the Lord, in the preaching work, we're happy and we're better able to put our troubles into perspective.

00:37:49.369 --> 00:37:57.369
Now, others of you support the kingdom work by serving at Bethel or by constructing and renovating theocratic facilities,

00:37:57.369 --> 00:38:05.369
others of you sharing relief work, but whatever you do, it brings joy and it brings glory to Jehovah.

00:38:05.369 --> 00:38:07.369
So here's a question.

00:38:07.369 --> 00:38:15.369
Are you staying as busy as you can in your circumstances allow in Jehovah's work?

00:38:15.369 --> 00:38:18.369
Continue to have plenty to do in the work of the Lord.

00:38:18.369 --> 00:38:22.369
You'll be happy and you'll never regret it.

00:38:22.369 --> 00:38:31.369
But now, our second point, we also establish a Jehovah designed our body with many parts, but to work as one unit.

00:38:31.369 --> 00:38:33.369
Well, what lesson do we learn from that?

00:38:33.369 --> 00:38:38.369
We'll look over to Ephesians chapter 4 and verse 16.

00:38:39.369 --> 00:38:44.219
Ephesians chapter 4 and verse 16.

00:38:44.219 --> 00:38:53.219
And it says, from him, all the body is harmoniously joined together and made to cooperate through every joint that gives what is needed.

00:38:53.219 --> 00:39:02.219
When each respective member functions properly, this contributes to the growth of the body as it builds itself up in love.

00:39:02.219 --> 00:39:04.219
So what do we learn from this?

00:39:04.219 --> 00:39:09.219
Stay united, cooperate together, function properly.

00:39:09.219 --> 00:39:14.219
We learn that every part of the human body is necessary and it must work together.

00:39:14.219 --> 00:39:20.219
Well, similarly, the congregation is made up of many different members.

00:39:20.219 --> 00:39:29.219
Each member, each of you, whether young or old, strong or frail, all of you contribute to the whole and the beauty of the congregation.

00:39:29.219 --> 00:39:31.219
Each one of you is needed.

00:39:31.219 --> 00:39:35.219
You are special to Jehovah and your brothers and sisters.

00:39:35.219 --> 00:39:40.219
And did you see when the congregation is harmoniously joined together, what happens?

00:39:40.219 --> 00:39:43.219
The congregation is built up.

00:39:43.219 --> 00:39:51.219
Now, again, many of you have said that you've never felt closer to each other or Jehovah's organization than you do now.

00:39:51.219 --> 00:39:54.219
Again, that's no coincidence.

00:39:54.219 --> 00:40:04.219
As the end draws near, Jehovah's gathering us closer and closer together in unity and those bonds among us need to grow even stronger.

00:40:04.219 --> 00:40:11.219
So how much we appreciate and how much we can learn from the wonderful way in which we are made.

00:40:11.219 --> 00:40:19.219
May each of us, and remember those two points, be determined to be as active as possible move in Jehovah's service,

00:40:19.219 --> 00:40:24.219
and two, may each of us do all that we can to promote unity.

00:40:24.219 --> 00:40:28.219
And if you do, you will be happy.

00:40:28.219 --> 00:40:34.219
And not only will you bring joy to yourself, but you will bring joy to others as well.

00:40:34.219 --> 00:40:42.219
But now, Brother Gaius Glockentine, a helper to the publishing committee will now present the next talk of this symposium,

00:40:42.219 --> 00:40:47.219
Creation proves that Jehovah wants us to rejoice, delightful sounds.

00:40:47.219 --> 00:40:58.980
Our well-designed body is indeed a reason for us to rejoice.

00:40:58.980 --> 00:41:02.980
Certain body parts help us to perceive the world around us.

00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:07.980
For example, please turn with me to Proverbs 20 verse 12.

00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:12.980
Let us see what the Scriptures say in connection with two sensory organs.

00:41:12.980 --> 00:41:16.980
Here in Proverbs 20 verse 12 we read,

00:41:16.980 --> 00:41:22.980
The hearing ear and the seeing eye, Jehovah has made both of them.

00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:27.980
Yes, our ability to hear and see is from Jehovah.

00:41:27.980 --> 00:41:30.980
How grateful we are that he has given us the senses.

00:41:30.980 --> 00:41:34.980
They allow us to enjoy life more fully.

00:41:34.980 --> 00:41:39.980
The hear, for example, allows us to hear delightful sounds.

00:41:39.980 --> 00:41:46.980
How does it make you feel when you hear birds chirping or the relaxing sound of a babbling brook?

00:41:46.980 --> 00:41:50.980
And how we cherish hearing the voice of a loved one.

00:41:50.980 --> 00:41:55.980
Maybe you're made, your father or mother, or your child.

00:41:55.980 --> 00:41:58.980
We also enjoy beautiful music.

00:41:58.980 --> 00:42:02.980
Even those who cannot hear can enjoy music,

00:42:02.980 --> 00:42:07.980
some connect with the song's bass notes or its beat rather than its melody.

00:42:07.980 --> 00:42:15.980
In the following video, note how Jehovah created us to enjoy a wide variety of sounds.

00:42:15.980 --> 00:42:42.510
Our world is full of sounds. Some are natural.

00:42:42.510 --> 00:42:52.869
Others we create.

00:42:52.869 --> 00:42:56.869
We can hear music before we're born.

00:42:56.869 --> 00:43:02.630
And can develop a love of music as we grow.

00:43:02.630 --> 00:43:05.630
We can compose music.

00:43:05.630 --> 00:43:08.630
Be moved by it.

00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:11.630
And replay it in our minds.

00:43:11.630 --> 00:43:17.630
Musical instruments typically combine a sound generator which produces tones

00:43:17.630 --> 00:43:22.630
with a resonator such as wood or metal which adds volume.

00:43:22.630 --> 00:43:26.630
The design resembles our own vocal organs.

00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:35.039
But few instruments compare to the beauty of the human voice.

00:43:35.039 --> 00:43:38.039
Our hearing complements the voice.

00:43:38.039 --> 00:43:44.539
We can listen to things that draw us closer to God

00:43:44.539 --> 00:43:51.909
and use the voice He gave us to praise Him with joy.

00:43:51.909 --> 00:43:55.909
Praise Ja. For Jehovah is good.

00:43:55.909 --> 00:44:08.130
Sing praises to His name. For it is pleasant.

00:44:08.130 --> 00:44:11.130
Yes, sounds definitely enrich our life.

00:44:11.130 --> 00:44:14.130
They make our life more enjoyable.

00:44:14.130 --> 00:44:18.130
Does this not instill in us the desire to praise Jehovah?

00:44:18.130 --> 00:44:23.130
Now let us please open to Isaiah chapter 30 verse 21.

00:44:23.130 --> 00:44:29.130
Here we see that ears and hearing are sometimes used in the figurative way in the Bible.

00:44:29.130 --> 00:44:33.130
Isaiah 30 verse 21 reads,

00:44:33.130 --> 00:44:36.130
and your own ears will hear word behind you saying,

00:44:36.130 --> 00:44:39.130
this is the way. Walk in it.

00:44:39.130 --> 00:44:44.130
In case you should go to the right or in case you should go to the left.

00:44:44.130 --> 00:44:48.130
We can hear Jehovah's figurative voice from His word the Bible

00:44:48.130 --> 00:44:52.130
and from His guidance through the Holy Spirit and the congregation.

00:44:52.130 --> 00:44:58.130
Jehovah's guidance is so clear it is as if we could hear Him speaking to us.

00:44:58.130 --> 00:45:01.130
Let me ask you a question.

00:45:01.130 --> 00:45:05.130
Does the sound of Jehovah's voice make you enjoy life?

00:45:05.130 --> 00:45:07.130
Does it make you rejoice?

00:45:07.130 --> 00:45:11.130
I suppose we would all answer with a clear yes.

00:45:11.130 --> 00:45:15.130
Jehovah's voice is a delightful sound.

00:45:15.130 --> 00:45:19.130
We all know how good it feels when we apply Jehovah's guidance

00:45:19.130 --> 00:45:23.130
and enjoy success in life.

00:45:23.130 --> 00:45:26.130
Let's think again about our literal ears.

00:45:26.130 --> 00:45:30.130
They are very sensitive so we need to protect them.

00:45:30.130 --> 00:45:34.130
Certain sounds, noise can even damage them.

00:45:34.130 --> 00:45:42.130
So to protect our hearing you might use acoustic earmarks to block out harmful noise.

00:45:42.130 --> 00:45:45.130
By what about our figurative ears?

00:45:45.130 --> 00:45:48.130
Do we need to protect them too?

00:45:48.130 --> 00:45:51.130
Are there sounds out there that can harm us?

00:45:51.130 --> 00:45:53.130
Yes, there are.

00:45:53.130 --> 00:46:00.130
The reality is we live in a world full of damaging and unpleasant noise.

00:46:00.130 --> 00:46:04.130
So then how can we protect ourselves?

00:46:04.130 --> 00:46:07.130
Here are three measures we need to take.

00:46:07.130 --> 00:46:12.130
First, block out the harmful noise around us.

00:46:12.130 --> 00:46:16.130
We can put on noise cancelling headphones.

00:46:16.130 --> 00:46:22.130
In other words, we refuse to listen to anything that can distance us from Jehovah.

00:46:22.130 --> 00:46:24.130
Like what?

00:46:24.130 --> 00:46:29.130
Deceptive reasoning and false accusations, for example, are very dangerous.

00:46:29.130 --> 00:46:33.130
They undermine our trust in Jehovah's organization.

00:46:33.130 --> 00:46:38.130
Some who were once part of the Christian congregation now attempt to mislead us.

00:46:38.130 --> 00:46:44.130
They spread half truths and outright lies about Jehovah's organization.

00:46:44.130 --> 00:46:53.130
Harmful sounds might also come from non-Christian workmates, schoolmates, or contacts on social media.

00:46:53.130 --> 00:46:55.130
They do not share our beliefs.

00:46:55.130 --> 00:46:59.130
So conversations with them are rarely faith strengthening.

00:46:59.130 --> 00:47:05.130
They might weaken our faith, making our Christian life course more difficult.

00:47:05.130 --> 00:47:13.130
Therefore, we need to protect our ears from damaging noise by not listening to it.

00:47:14.130 --> 00:47:18.130
What is the second way to protect ourselves from damaging sounds?

00:47:18.130 --> 00:47:26.570
Headphones can help us block out the noise around us and replace it with something delightful.

00:47:26.570 --> 00:47:29.570
Maybe a favorite song.

00:47:29.570 --> 00:47:35.570
So put on our figurative headphones and listen to hold some things.

00:47:35.570 --> 00:47:38.570
Our favorite sounds.

00:47:38.570 --> 00:47:41.570
Delightful sounds from Jehovah.

00:47:41.570 --> 00:47:44.570
This is what we hear at our Christian meetings.

00:47:44.570 --> 00:47:51.570
And when we sing at our Christian meetings like we've seen in the video, our sounds praise Jehovah.

00:47:51.570 --> 00:47:54.570
What we read in our publications.

00:47:54.570 --> 00:47:56.570
What we see in our website.

00:47:56.570 --> 00:48:00.570
What we hear in our building conversations with our brothers and sisters.

00:48:00.570 --> 00:48:07.389
All of these beautiful sounds protect our ears.

00:48:07.389 --> 00:48:12.389
A third aid for protecting our ears is Jehovah's help.

00:48:12.389 --> 00:48:16.389
Sometimes we might not feel like putting on our headphones.

00:48:16.389 --> 00:48:21.389
We might argue it is so much more comfortable without them.

00:48:21.389 --> 00:48:25.389
The damage to my ears will not be that serious.

00:48:25.389 --> 00:48:29.389
Now this is where Jehovah comes into play.

00:48:29.389 --> 00:48:35.389
He will help us listen to his voice whenever we ask him for his help in prayer.

00:48:35.389 --> 00:48:39.389
He will motivate us to put on our headphones so to speak.

00:48:39.389 --> 00:48:47.389
He gives us the inner strength to stop listening to sounds that might be tempting and yet are so dangerous.

00:48:47.389 --> 00:48:53.389
So what are the three ways to protect our figurative ears.

00:48:53.389 --> 00:48:57.389
We stop listening to damaging sounds.

00:48:57.389 --> 00:49:00.389
We listen to hold some things.

00:49:00.389 --> 00:49:03.389
And we pray for Jehovah's help.

00:49:03.389 --> 00:49:10.389
Dear brothers and sisters, Jehovah created sounds because he wants us to enjoy life.

00:49:10.389 --> 00:49:14.389
Please let us continue to make wise use of our hearing.

00:49:14.389 --> 00:49:20.389
And then we will rejoice in hearing delightful sounds forever.

00:49:20.389 --> 00:49:29.179
Brother John Akron, helper to the coordinators committee, will now present the last talk of this symposium.

00:49:29.179 --> 00:49:34.179
Creation proves that Jehovah wants us to rejoice.

00:49:34.179 --> 00:49:36.179
Fascinating animals.

00:49:36.179 --> 00:49:45.130
What's your favorite animal?

00:49:45.130 --> 00:49:48.130
My favorite animal is the dolphin.

00:49:48.130 --> 00:49:53.130
One time I was snorkeling in the ocean and a pot of dolphins came by.

00:49:53.130 --> 00:49:56.130
And of course with the mask on I could see underwater.

00:49:56.130 --> 00:50:01.130
And it was beautiful to watch how they could swim, how sleek they were in the water.

00:50:01.130 --> 00:50:06.130
Then I watched as one of them used his powerful tail to shoot up to the surface of the water.

00:50:06.130 --> 00:50:11.130
I lifted my head up and watched him jump out of the water and gracefully go right back in.

00:50:11.130 --> 00:50:14.130
It was a sight I won't forget.

00:50:14.130 --> 00:50:23.130
I'm sure that if we talk to each of you watching this, you could tell some really good story about your favorite animal.

00:50:23.130 --> 00:50:27.130
Our beautiful planet earth is full of animals.

00:50:27.130 --> 00:50:34.130
Of course though, for many of us in modern day life, we don't get a chance to interact with animals that much.

00:50:34.130 --> 00:50:39.130
Most of our interaction with animals is second hand through books or videos.

00:50:39.130 --> 00:50:44.130
In fact, the internet is full of videos, especially of cats.

00:50:44.130 --> 00:50:46.130
People share these videos why?

00:50:46.130 --> 00:50:50.130
Because it makes them smile. They enjoy watching them.

00:50:50.130 --> 00:50:57.130
In fact, many of you are probably thinking of some video you just watched about animals.

00:50:57.130 --> 00:51:05.130
Clearly, Jehovah created animals with qualities to bring us joy, to make us happy.

00:51:05.130 --> 00:51:10.130
Watching them in person or in videos can cultivate our interest.

00:51:10.130 --> 00:51:15.130
They can entertain us and make us feel good.

00:51:15.130 --> 00:51:20.130
We see Jehovah sense of humor and how the animals interact and play with one another.

00:51:20.130 --> 00:51:23.130
And we can also learn lessons from the animals.

00:51:23.130 --> 00:51:27.130
Proverbs chapter 6 and verse 6 is an example of that.

00:51:27.130 --> 00:51:30.130
Proverbs chapter 6 and verse 6.

00:51:30.130 --> 00:51:33.130
Go to the ant, you lazy one.

00:51:33.130 --> 00:51:36.130
Observe its ways and become wise.

00:51:36.130 --> 00:51:40.130
Now I can remember as a young boy, I was fascinated with ants.

00:51:40.130 --> 00:51:44.130
So many of them, and yet they all knew what to do.

00:51:44.130 --> 00:51:49.130
And they could carry these really big leaves and other things for their size.

00:51:49.130 --> 00:51:54.130
It was amazing to see what they could do, even the building of their tunnels.

00:51:54.130 --> 00:51:59.130
As children, many of us were interested in animals, fascinated with them.

00:51:59.130 --> 00:52:06.130
However, as we got older, we became more fascinated with technology, or things that man has made.

00:52:06.130 --> 00:52:14.130
But really, the things that man has made cannot compare to the things Jehovah has made, especially the animals.

00:52:14.130 --> 00:52:24.130
The design and wonder, you feel when you watch your favorite animal is in a category all by itself.

00:52:24.130 --> 00:52:29.130
Now in the following video, we're going to see some really beautiful animals.

00:52:29.130 --> 00:52:33.130
Maybe you will see your favorite animal.

00:52:33.130 --> 00:52:39.530
Animals fascinate us.

00:52:39.530 --> 00:52:50.920
We marvel at their speed, their agility, and their strength.

00:52:50.920 --> 00:52:57.769
Their beauty and behavior are a pleasure to watch.

00:52:57.769 --> 00:53:03.550
Like us, they play.

00:53:03.550 --> 00:53:10.389
Some even dance.

00:53:10.389 --> 00:53:17.579
They are industrious.

00:53:17.579 --> 00:53:23.909
A beaver dam can extend hundreds of meters.

00:53:23.909 --> 00:53:26.909
Some can even be seen from space.

00:53:26.909 --> 00:53:33.159
When we observe animals, we learn more about the creator.

00:53:33.159 --> 00:53:43.280
Their instinctive wisdom reveals his wisdom.

00:53:43.280 --> 00:53:48.280
He is caring and generous.

00:53:48.280 --> 00:53:53.489
And he is a happy God.

00:53:53.489 --> 00:54:00.280
Animals fascinate us because we are made in God's image.

00:54:00.280 --> 00:54:04.280
We enjoy what he enjoys.

00:54:04.280 --> 00:54:08.280
Especially our earth and its amazing animals.

00:54:08.280 --> 00:54:11.280
They are his gift to us.

00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:17.280
Let us make man in our image according to our likeness.

00:54:17.280 --> 00:54:27.280
And let them have in subjection the fish of the sea and the flying creatures of the heavens and the domestic animals and all the earth.

00:54:27.280 --> 00:54:39.380
Were you and the others with you watching that video smiling?

00:54:39.380 --> 00:54:44.380
Or maybe even laughing a little bit when you saw the little dog jumping back and forth?

00:54:44.380 --> 00:54:51.380
You see the design of animals to bring us joy is not an evolutionary accident.

00:54:51.380 --> 00:55:00.380
Jehovah and Jesus, his master worker, found joy in creating and designing animal life to delight us.

00:55:00.380 --> 00:55:07.380
Now, can you imagine Jehovah and Jesus discussing designing an elephant?

00:55:07.380 --> 00:55:18.380
The elephant trunk is a nose, it's an arm, it's a shower head, it's a straw, and can even be a snorkel.

00:55:18.380 --> 00:55:24.380
Did you know that their feet are so well padded that you can hardly hear them coming?

00:55:24.380 --> 00:55:31.380
Imagine, Jehovah and Jesus making this huge elephant and saying, we're going to make it really quiet.

00:55:31.380 --> 00:55:38.380
Or can you imagine what the angels thought when they first saw a lemur dancing?

00:55:38.380 --> 00:55:42.380
Or a hummingbird hovering in the air?

00:55:42.380 --> 00:55:45.380
Or a little puppy chasing its tail?

00:55:45.380 --> 00:55:48.380
Or can you imagine being Adam?

00:55:48.380 --> 00:55:53.380
The first human being amongst all of these animals.

00:55:53.380 --> 00:55:59.750
How Adam must have thrilled to watch the animals and name them?

00:55:59.750 --> 00:56:04.750
What would you have called an animal with a funny hump on its back?

00:56:04.750 --> 00:56:09.750
Or a bird that could mimic the sounds you made?

00:56:09.750 --> 00:56:13.750
Or a lizard that could change colors?

00:56:13.750 --> 00:56:21.260
Maybe even looking at it as it moved, changing colors, wondering how did it do that?

00:56:21.260 --> 00:56:26.260
Jehovah assigned Adam to not only name the animals but to care for them.

00:56:26.260 --> 00:56:34.260
Let's read the scripture that was highlighted in our video in Genesis 1 and verse 26.

00:56:34.260 --> 00:56:38.260
Genesis 1 and verse 26.

00:56:38.260 --> 00:56:44.260
Since then God said, let us make man in our image according to our likeness

00:56:44.260 --> 00:56:51.260
and let them have in subjection the fish of the sea and the flying creatures of the heavens and the domestic animals

00:56:51.260 --> 00:56:56.260
and all the earth and every creeping animal that is moving on the earth.

00:56:56.260 --> 00:57:06.260
Yes, Jehovah God wanted Adam and his descendants, that's us, to take care of the animals and to take the light in them.

00:57:06.260 --> 00:57:13.260
If we take time to enjoy animal life, we can make some very fascinating discoveries.

00:57:13.260 --> 00:57:18.260
Did you see in the video the lemurs of Madagascar?

00:57:18.260 --> 00:57:22.260
Do you know how many varieties of lemurs there are?

00:57:22.260 --> 00:57:25.260
Do you know what lemurs eat?

00:57:25.260 --> 00:57:28.260
Have you ever seen lemurs play?

00:57:28.260 --> 00:57:34.260
I have and I guarantee you you will enjoy it and smile when you do.

00:57:34.260 --> 00:57:37.260
I made one discovery about dolphins.

00:57:37.260 --> 00:57:43.260
Dolphins can blow underwater a perfect circle of air

00:57:43.260 --> 00:57:46.260
and then they like to play with it afterwards.

00:57:46.260 --> 00:57:51.260
First time I saw that video, I couldn't hardly believe my eyes.

00:57:51.260 --> 00:57:58.260
Friends, today we can only imagine what it will be like in the future paradise

00:57:58.260 --> 00:58:03.260
when we can really enjoy animal life the way Jehovah truly intended.

00:58:03.260 --> 00:58:15.889
In review, this symposium has been about Jehovah's creative works, exquisite flowers, delicious food,

00:58:15.889 --> 00:58:23.889
beautiful colors, our well-designed bodies, delightful sounds and fascinating animals,

00:58:23.889 --> 00:58:29.889
all of which convinces us that Jehovah wants us to enjoy life.

00:58:29.889 --> 00:58:37.889
At a time when many people are not finding meaning or joy in the things that man has made,

00:58:37.889 --> 00:58:44.889
observe and rejoice in the gift of the things that Jehovah has made and given to us.

00:58:44.889 --> 00:58:48.889
Make them a source of true joy in your life.

00:58:48.889 --> 00:58:55.519
Thank you brothers for sharing those thought-provoking lessons from creation.

00:58:55.519 --> 00:59:00.519
Our Christian brothers and sisters also bring us great joy.

00:59:00.519 --> 00:59:04.519
How can we safeguard and strengthen our relationships with them?

00:59:04.519 --> 00:59:10.519
Brother Stephen led of the governing body will direct us to the Bible's Wise Council.

00:59:10.519 --> 00:59:14.519
His theme is, those who promote peace have joy.

00:59:14.519 --> 00:59:15.519
Why?

00:59:15.519 --> 00:59:27.269
Ravens brought Elijah bread and meat morning and evening.

00:59:27.269 --> 00:59:33.269
Jesus transformed a hundred gallons of water into a very fine wine.

00:59:33.269 --> 00:59:40.269
A hundred and twenty Christians suddenly could speak different languages.

00:59:40.269 --> 00:59:43.269
What do those three events have in common?

00:59:43.269 --> 00:59:47.269
They were all three miracles produced by Holy Spirit.

00:59:48.269 --> 00:59:52.269
But miracles are no longer happening today, is that right?

00:59:52.269 --> 00:59:54.269
Not really if you think about it.

00:59:54.269 --> 01:00:02.269
If we think about it, the peace, the love, the harmony of Jehovah's people in a world that is so divided

01:00:02.269 --> 01:00:05.269
is a modern-day miracle.

01:00:05.269 --> 01:00:14.269
In contrast, Satan's world around us is becoming more divided by race, ethnicity, religion, political affiliation, and so forth.

01:00:14.269 --> 01:00:18.269
But Jehovah's people, more united than ever.

01:00:18.269 --> 01:00:23.269
And when we attend our assemblies and conventions, we especially see this.

01:00:23.269 --> 01:00:32.269
We see different races and nationalities enjoying a genuinely peaceful, joyful gathering.

01:00:32.269 --> 01:00:39.269
In fact, looking at a world map, sister let an iron able to calculate that during the past twenty years,

01:00:39.269 --> 01:00:46.269
we've attended assemblies, conventions, large gatherings, and at least 82 different countries.

01:00:46.269 --> 01:00:52.269
And every one of them overflowed with love and joy.

01:00:52.269 --> 01:00:59.269
And every one of them convinced us even more that these are Jehovah's people.

01:00:59.269 --> 01:01:08.269
People he's gathered from all nations, tribes, peoples, and tongues into his organization and is preparing for the new world.

01:01:08.269 --> 01:01:13.269
But now we ask, what makes this modern-day miracle possible?

01:01:13.269 --> 01:01:25.269
The answer, it stems from a peaceful relationship that we have with our father, Jehovah, who is called in 1 Thessalonians 523, the God of Peace.

01:01:25.269 --> 01:01:29.269
As his children, we strive to imitate him.

01:01:29.269 --> 01:01:37.269
And we're all brothers and sisters, we have the same father, so we are ones who show peace and love like our father.

01:01:37.269 --> 01:01:43.269
But here's another question, is maintaining this peace in harmony automatic?

01:01:43.269 --> 01:01:48.269
Well, is maintaining a garden, an automobile, our health automatic?

01:01:48.269 --> 01:01:56.269
No, it takes effort, doesn't it? We're all imperfect, so we have to work at maintaining peace every day.

01:01:56.269 --> 01:02:02.269
That's the thought if you go to 1 Peter 3, please. It does take effort.

01:02:02.269 --> 01:02:06.269
1 Peter 3, verse 10,

01:02:06.269 --> 01:02:16.269
For whoever would love life and see good days must guard his tongue from bad and his lips from speaking deception,

01:02:16.269 --> 01:02:21.269
let him turn away from what is bad and do what is good.

01:02:21.269 --> 01:02:27.269
Now notice, let him seek peace and pursue it.

01:02:27.269 --> 01:02:35.269
So notice, effort to turn from bad, do good, seek peace and pursue it. Two action verbs.

01:02:35.269 --> 01:02:41.269
If you want to illustrate that, think of a policeman seeking pursuing a criminal.

01:02:41.269 --> 01:02:49.269
The criminal is trying to get away, isn't he? Well, peace tries to get away from us because of imperfection, but we have to pursue it.

01:02:49.269 --> 01:02:54.269
Interestingly, the Bible links peace to happiness.

01:02:54.269 --> 01:02:59.269
Proverbs 12-20, the theme scripture for this talk says,

01:02:59.269 --> 01:03:06.269
Those who promote peace have joy. Matthew 5-9.

01:03:06.269 --> 01:03:11.269
Happy are the peacemakers, since they will be called sons of God.

01:03:11.269 --> 01:03:14.269
Now it didn't say happy are the peaceful.

01:03:14.269 --> 01:03:19.269
See, that's just tranquil, passive. Even a dead body is peaceful.

01:03:19.269 --> 01:03:23.269
No happy are the peacemakers.

01:03:23.269 --> 01:03:26.269
A peacemaker actively promotes peace.

01:03:26.269 --> 01:03:29.269
He makes peace where it previously was lacking.

01:03:29.269 --> 01:03:33.269
If you think about cows, they make milk.

01:03:33.269 --> 01:03:37.269
Bees make honey. A cheese maker makes cheese.

01:03:37.269 --> 01:03:39.269
A peacemaker makes peace.

01:03:39.269 --> 01:03:42.269
Maybe it's been lost, it's been disturbed.

01:03:42.269 --> 01:03:44.269
But he has skill in restoring it.

01:03:44.269 --> 01:03:51.269
And of course, a peacemaker avoids doing anything that would disturb the peace in the first place.

01:03:51.269 --> 01:03:58.269
He works very hard to create an environment where peace can prevail.

01:03:58.269 --> 01:04:06.269
But now that leads us into the discussion about how peacemakers avoid the two peace destroyers,

01:04:06.269 --> 01:04:10.269
jealousy and contentiousness.

01:04:10.269 --> 01:04:16.269
Now these two peace disturbers are identified at James chapter 3.

01:04:16.269 --> 01:04:20.269
Let's go there, please. James chapter 3.

01:04:20.269 --> 01:04:24.269
And let's read together verses 14 and 15.

01:04:24.269 --> 01:04:32.030
But if you have bitter jealousy and contentiousness in your hearts,

01:04:32.030 --> 01:04:36.030
do not be bragging and lying against the truth.

01:04:36.030 --> 01:04:40.030
This is not the wisdom that comes down from above.

01:04:40.030 --> 01:04:45.030
It is earthly, animalistic, demonic.

01:04:45.030 --> 01:04:48.030
You know, his first jealousy is identified.

01:04:48.030 --> 01:04:50.030
What is jealousy?

01:04:50.030 --> 01:04:56.030
It means to resent someone because of his possessions, talents, or position.

01:04:56.030 --> 01:05:01.030
Rather than be happy for him, we resent him.

01:05:01.030 --> 01:05:04.030
Maybe even dislike him for what he has.

01:05:04.030 --> 01:05:06.030
Usually things that we don't have.

01:05:06.030 --> 01:05:13.030
But what makes this very serious is that jealousy can escalate to being envy.

01:05:13.030 --> 01:05:18.030
Now, what is envy? And what's the difference between envy and jealousy?

01:05:18.030 --> 01:05:21.030
One biblical reference works as this.

01:05:21.030 --> 01:05:27.030
Jealousy refers to the desire to be as well off as another.

01:05:28.030 --> 01:05:36.030
But envy refers to the desire to deprive another of what he has.

01:05:36.030 --> 01:05:40.030
So the envious person, not only begrudges what someone has,

01:05:40.030 --> 01:05:43.030
he actually wants to take it away from him.

01:05:43.030 --> 01:05:47.030
That second peace destroyer, contentiousness.

01:05:47.030 --> 01:05:49.030
What does that mean?

01:05:49.030 --> 01:05:53.030
Being disagreeable, argumentative, competitive, terrible quality.

01:05:53.030 --> 01:05:56.030
It's the product of pride and selfish ambition.

01:05:56.030 --> 01:06:00.030
And as we read earlier, in James 3, 14, and 15,

01:06:00.030 --> 01:06:03.030
it's certainly not part of that wisdom that comes down from above,

01:06:03.030 --> 01:06:10.030
but rather it is earthly, characteristic of earthly humans who are alienated from God.

01:06:10.030 --> 01:06:16.030
It is animalistic, characteristic of animals who lack spirituality

01:06:16.030 --> 01:06:19.030
and are often contentious with each other.

01:06:19.030 --> 01:06:21.030
It is even demonic.

01:06:21.030 --> 01:06:27.030
Characteristic of the wicked spirits who are very proud and ambitious.

01:06:27.030 --> 01:06:35.030
But genuine peacemakers work very hard to avoid these two peace disturbers,

01:06:35.030 --> 01:06:37.030
jealousy and contentiousness.

01:06:37.030 --> 01:06:42.030
They neither flop their talents nor do they feel threatened

01:06:42.030 --> 01:06:47.030
if others are more skilled preachers, teachers, organizers or shepherds.

01:06:48.030 --> 01:06:51.030
They're very happy to be considered a lesser one,

01:06:51.030 --> 01:06:55.030
as Jesus encouraged at Luke 9.48.

01:06:55.030 --> 01:07:00.030
Now it's true, a peacemaker made his our certain privileges of service,

01:07:00.030 --> 01:07:03.030
but he is not consumed with ambition.

01:07:03.030 --> 01:07:05.030
See, he's balanced in his approach.

01:07:05.030 --> 01:07:08.030
As it says at 1 Timothy 3-1,

01:07:08.030 --> 01:07:13.030
if a man is reaching out to be an overseer,

01:07:13.030 --> 01:07:16.030
he is deserous of a fine work.

01:07:16.030 --> 01:07:21.030
But it didn't say he should ambitiously grab to be an overseer.

01:07:21.030 --> 01:07:23.030
See, he's balanced.

01:07:23.030 --> 01:07:28.030
We could illustrate this by reaching out for a nice tasty piece of fruit on a tree

01:07:28.030 --> 01:07:34.030
and then think of a small boy very aggressively grabbing for a toy,

01:07:34.030 --> 01:07:37.030
perhaps to try to take it away from another boy.

01:07:37.030 --> 01:07:40.030
There's a real difference, isn't there?

01:07:40.030 --> 01:07:45.030
But now how does a peacemaker reach out to qualify for privileges of service?

01:07:46.030 --> 01:07:51.030
Well, he just works hard to develop Christian qualities within himself,

01:07:51.030 --> 01:07:55.030
and he just works hard in behalf of King Dimitris,

01:07:55.030 --> 01:07:58.030
and he's guided by Galatians 6 verse 4,

01:07:58.030 --> 01:08:04.030
where it says he will have cause for rejoicing in regard to himself alone

01:08:04.030 --> 01:08:08.030
and not in comparison with the other person.

01:08:08.030 --> 01:08:13.030
Additionally, a real peacemaker humbly waits on Jehovah

01:08:13.030 --> 01:08:18.029
to determine when he's qualified to receive a certain privilege.

01:08:18.029 --> 01:08:20.029
And Jehovah knows, doesn't he?

01:08:20.029 --> 01:08:25.029
I love the account about Moses, how when he was 40 years old,

01:08:25.029 --> 01:08:31.029
he really thought he was qualified ready to lead the Israelites out of Egypt.

01:08:31.029 --> 01:08:34.029
But Jehovah knew he wasn't ready yet,

01:08:34.029 --> 01:08:42.029
but now after tending flocks for 40 years and mid-end when he was now 80 years old,

01:08:42.029 --> 01:08:44.029
Jehovah knew now he was ready.

01:08:44.029 --> 01:08:48.029
Interestingly, at this point, Moses thought he wasn't ready,

01:08:48.029 --> 01:08:51.029
but Jehovah assured him that he was.

01:08:51.029 --> 01:08:55.029
And when a peacemaker does receive a privilege of service,

01:08:55.029 --> 01:08:59.029
he credits receiving it to Jehovah,

01:08:59.029 --> 01:09:03.029
and not as a personal achievement.

01:09:03.029 --> 01:09:09.029
So to conclude this portion of our talk about avoiding these peace disturbance,

01:09:09.029 --> 01:09:14.029
we say, may we all strive to be genuine peacemakers,

01:09:14.029 --> 01:09:18.029
analyzing ourselves, praying for Jehovah's spirit,

01:09:18.029 --> 01:09:21.029
to help us to avoid any tendency,

01:09:21.029 --> 01:09:27.029
to be jealous, to envy, or to be contentious with our brothers.

01:09:27.029 --> 01:09:31.029
But now, let's talk about some things we can do personally,

01:09:31.029 --> 01:09:34.029
to promote peace and joy.

01:09:34.029 --> 01:09:37.029
In fact, let's talk quickly about six things we can do.

01:09:38.029 --> 01:09:43.029
Number one, cultivate humility and modesty.

01:09:43.029 --> 01:09:47.029
Humility means to consider others superior to ourselves.

01:09:47.029 --> 01:09:52.029
Modesty means to be aware of our own limitations.

01:09:52.029 --> 01:09:55.029
Now, if we have those two closely related qualities,

01:09:55.029 --> 01:10:00.029
we'll be able to apply Romans chapter 12, verse 3,

01:10:00.029 --> 01:10:05.029
which says we should not think more of ourselves than it is necessary to think,

01:10:05.029 --> 01:10:09.029
but to think so as to have a sound mind.

01:10:09.029 --> 01:10:13.029
And here's the second thing we can do to promote joy and peace.

01:10:13.029 --> 01:10:20.029
Appreciate and value the good qualities and talents of others.

01:10:20.029 --> 01:10:24.029
Focus on their good points, not their flaws.

01:10:24.029 --> 01:10:27.029
And how thankful we can be that Jehovah does that with us.

01:10:27.029 --> 01:10:30.029
Otherwise, we'd be doomed, wouldn't we?

01:10:30.029 --> 01:10:33.029
But maybe you heard the illustration of a brother,

01:10:33.029 --> 01:10:38.029
holding up a white piece of paper with a red spot in the middle

01:10:38.029 --> 01:10:42.029
and asking an audience what they see.

01:10:42.029 --> 01:10:45.029
Well, most say they see a red spot.

01:10:45.029 --> 01:10:51.029
But then he points out that actually 99% of what they're looking at is white paper.

01:10:51.029 --> 01:10:54.029
But we tend to notice the spot.

01:10:54.029 --> 01:10:57.029
Well, if we're not careful, that's what we can do with our brothers.

01:10:57.029 --> 01:10:59.029
No set flaw, rather than all the good qualities.

01:11:00.029 --> 01:11:07.029
But may all of us cultivate the Jehovah-like quality of noticing,

01:11:07.029 --> 01:11:14.029
appreciating and valuing the good qualities of our brothers.

01:11:14.029 --> 01:11:16.029
Now here's the third thing we can do.

01:11:16.029 --> 01:11:21.029
Never presume that fellow Christians are trying to outdo us.

01:11:21.029 --> 01:11:24.029
Verse Corinthians 137 says,

01:11:25.029 --> 01:11:28.029
So we believe, we hope,

01:11:28.029 --> 01:11:33.029
that our brothers are doing what they're doing out of a good motive

01:11:33.029 --> 01:11:36.029
to please Jehovah, not to outdo us.

01:11:36.029 --> 01:11:40.029
And we remember Jehovah's appointed only one judge, Jesus.

01:11:40.029 --> 01:11:47.029
We are no judge, we have no right to negatively judge our brothers' motives.

01:11:47.029 --> 01:11:50.029
Now here's the fourth thing we can do.

01:11:51.029 --> 01:11:57.029
Strive to always rejoice over our brothers' privileges and successes.

01:11:57.029 --> 01:11:59.029
Romans 12, 15.

01:11:59.029 --> 01:12:02.029
Rejoice with those who rejoice.

01:12:02.029 --> 01:12:04.029
Weep with those who weep.

01:12:04.029 --> 01:12:06.029
Now which is easier?

01:12:06.029 --> 01:12:12.029
Well generally it's not so hard to weep with someone who's had some tragedy.

01:12:12.029 --> 01:12:16.029
But now what if some really good things happen to them and it hasn't happened to us?

01:12:16.029 --> 01:12:18.029
I'm so happy.

01:12:18.029 --> 01:12:21.029
I just got appointed as a regular pioneer.

01:12:21.029 --> 01:12:24.029
Now we were really hoping to get into the pioneer work ourselves,

01:12:24.029 --> 01:12:27.029
but we haven't been able to do it.

01:12:27.029 --> 01:12:31.029
Are we going to really be happy from our heart with our brother?

01:12:31.029 --> 01:12:35.029
Well if we love our brother and we love Jehovah,

01:12:35.029 --> 01:12:39.029
then we're going to work really hard to have that right attitude from our heart.

01:12:39.029 --> 01:12:44.029
See, we will smash any hint of jealousy.

01:12:44.029 --> 01:12:47.029
We'll smash it with love.

01:12:47.029 --> 01:12:50.029
Now here's a fifth thing we can do.

01:12:50.029 --> 01:12:55.029
Faithfully support those who serve in responsible positions,

01:12:55.029 --> 01:12:59.029
such as the elders, and obviously doing that.

01:12:59.029 --> 01:13:06.029
Supporting these ones or taking the lead definitely promotes peace and joy in the congregation.

01:13:06.029 --> 01:13:08.029
Here's one more thing.

01:13:08.029 --> 01:13:13.029
Center your life on serving Jehovah and helping others,

01:13:13.029 --> 01:13:16.029
rather than focusing on ourselves.

01:13:16.029 --> 01:13:19.029
Maybe our feelings,

01:13:19.029 --> 01:13:22.029
our perceived reputation,

01:13:22.029 --> 01:13:25.029
if we focus on serving Jehovah

01:13:25.029 --> 01:13:27.029
and helping our brothers,

01:13:27.029 --> 01:13:31.029
will truly be peace promoters in the congregation.

01:13:31.029 --> 01:13:33.029
By doing those six things,

01:13:33.029 --> 01:13:36.029
we'll prove that we're peacemakers,

01:13:36.029 --> 01:13:40.029
peace promoters who are reflecting the wisdom from above.

01:13:40.029 --> 01:13:43.029
Now that's the thought again, let's go back to James chapter three,

01:13:43.029 --> 01:13:46.029
that wisdom from above.

01:13:46.029 --> 01:13:49.029
Now that's what we want to reflect.

01:13:49.029 --> 01:13:51.029
James chapter three,

01:13:51.029 --> 01:13:55.029
and let's take a look this time at verse number 13.

01:13:55.029 --> 01:13:59.029
Who is wise in understanding among you?

01:13:59.029 --> 01:14:04.029
Let him by his fine conduct demonstrate works performed

01:14:04.029 --> 01:14:08.029
with a mildness that comes from wisdom,

01:14:08.029 --> 01:14:10.029
and then drop down to verse 17.

01:14:10.029 --> 01:14:15.029
But the wisdom from above is first of all pure,

01:14:15.029 --> 01:14:17.029
then, now notice,

01:14:17.029 --> 01:14:18.029
peaceable,

01:14:18.029 --> 01:14:20.029
it didn't say peaceful,

01:14:20.029 --> 01:14:21.029
passive,

01:14:21.029 --> 01:14:22.029
peaceable,

01:14:22.029 --> 01:14:23.029
that means a peacemaker.

01:14:23.029 --> 01:14:26.029
Reasonable, ready to obey,

01:14:26.029 --> 01:14:28.029
full of mercy and good fruits,

01:14:28.029 --> 01:14:31.029
impartial, not hypocritical.

01:14:31.029 --> 01:14:32.029
Moreover,

01:14:32.029 --> 01:14:37.029
the fruit of righteousness is sewn in peaceful conditions

01:14:37.029 --> 01:14:41.029
for those who are making peace.

01:14:41.029 --> 01:14:45.029
Yes, we're encouraged to be a peacemaker,

01:14:45.029 --> 01:14:47.029
and when we do this,

01:14:47.029 --> 01:14:49.029
we bring joy to ourselves.

01:14:49.029 --> 01:14:51.029
We impart joy to others,

01:14:51.029 --> 01:14:53.029
and most importantly,

01:14:53.029 --> 01:14:56.029
we make Jehovah rejoice.

01:14:56.029 --> 01:14:58.029
But now think about this,

01:14:58.029 --> 01:15:00.029
once a peacemaker,

01:15:00.029 --> 01:15:03.029
doesn't mean always a peacemaker.

01:15:03.029 --> 01:15:06.029
We have to keep working at this quality.

01:15:06.029 --> 01:15:09.029
Now this will be well illustrated

01:15:09.029 --> 01:15:14.029
in the following video interview.

01:15:14.029 --> 01:15:18.029
I got married in 2002.

01:15:18.029 --> 01:15:19.029
Around that time,

01:15:19.029 --> 01:15:21.029
I was appointed a ministerial servant,

01:15:21.029 --> 01:15:25.029
and my wife and I were serving as regular pioneers.

01:15:25.029 --> 01:15:27.029
In 2004,

01:15:27.029 --> 01:15:31.029
we were given the opportunity to serve as special pioneers.

01:15:31.029 --> 01:15:34.029
It was something that we really wanted,

01:15:34.029 --> 01:15:37.029
because we wanted to do more for Jehovah.

01:15:37.029 --> 01:15:39.029
So when we got that assignment,

01:15:39.029 --> 01:15:41.029
we were delighted.

01:15:41.029 --> 01:15:44.029
The brothers in the congregation were also very happy for us.

01:15:44.029 --> 01:15:51.289
But everything did not go smoothly.

01:15:51.289 --> 01:15:52.289
As time went on,

01:15:52.289 --> 01:15:55.289
I faced some difficult situations.

01:15:55.289 --> 01:15:58.289
The fact that I was not appointed as an elder

01:15:58.289 --> 01:16:00.289
made me feel disappointed.

01:16:00.289 --> 01:16:04.779
In one congregation,

01:16:04.779 --> 01:16:06.779
two brothers who had served as ministerial servants

01:16:06.779 --> 01:16:08.779
for a shorter time than I had,

01:16:08.779 --> 01:16:10.779
were appointed as elders.

01:16:10.779 --> 01:16:14.159
I felt that those brothers did not have

01:16:14.159 --> 01:16:16.159
as much experience as I had.

01:16:16.159 --> 01:16:17.159
I thought,

01:16:17.159 --> 01:16:19.159
I am the one with the experience,

01:16:19.159 --> 01:16:21.159
so why didn't I get appointed?

01:16:21.159 --> 01:16:23.159
I started to question my own qualifications,

01:16:23.159 --> 01:16:25.159
and this made me very sad.

01:16:25.159 --> 01:16:29.079
After the two brothers were appointed,

01:16:29.079 --> 01:16:32.079
I started to dislike them.

01:16:32.079 --> 01:16:34.079
I was also angry with them,

01:16:34.079 --> 01:16:36.079
and the anger even progressed

01:16:36.079 --> 01:16:38.079
a little toward hatred.

01:16:38.079 --> 01:16:43.319
It was a real challenge for me to serve in that congregation,

01:16:43.319 --> 01:16:46.319
attending meetings was difficult.

01:16:46.319 --> 01:16:49.319
I would go with a heavy heart.

01:16:49.319 --> 01:16:52.319
I put a lot of effort into making personal changes,

01:16:52.319 --> 01:16:56.319
changing my attitude and getting rid of my negative traits.

01:16:56.319 --> 01:16:58.319
I knew that if I did nothing,

01:16:58.319 --> 01:17:01.319
it was going to affect the worship I give to Jehovah,

01:17:01.319 --> 01:17:04.319
and also the relationship with my brothers.

01:17:04.319 --> 01:17:09.319
My wife and I could end up completely losing our joy.

01:17:09.319 --> 01:17:11.319
In order to make things right,

01:17:11.319 --> 01:17:14.319
I prayed intensely to Jehovah.

01:17:14.319 --> 01:17:17.319
I spent time in deep personal Bible study.

01:17:17.319 --> 01:17:20.319
My wife would also find articles about maintaining peace

01:17:20.319 --> 01:17:21.319
with the brothers,

01:17:21.319 --> 01:17:23.319
and would give them to me to read.

01:17:23.319 --> 01:17:25.319
She even selected kingdom songs

01:17:25.319 --> 01:17:27.319
that dealt with maintaining peace,

01:17:27.319 --> 01:17:32.100
and she would sing them to me.

01:17:32.100 --> 01:17:34.100
I made a lot of changes to my attitude,

01:17:34.100 --> 01:17:36.100
and worked hard to progress as a person

01:17:36.100 --> 01:17:38.100
whom Jehovah would approve.

01:17:38.100 --> 01:17:40.100
I tried to view my brothers

01:17:40.100 --> 01:17:42.100
the same way Jehovah did,

01:17:42.100 --> 01:17:46.920
and to serve him with joy.

01:17:46.920 --> 01:17:48.920
I really wanted to give my best to Jehovah,

01:17:48.920 --> 01:17:50.920
and to the brothers.

01:17:50.920 --> 01:17:53.920
At the same time, I did not want those wrong thoughts

01:17:53.920 --> 01:18:00.180
to ever come back into my heart.

01:18:00.180 --> 01:18:02.180
The valuable lessons that I have learned

01:18:02.180 --> 01:18:05.180
is that privileges are not more important.

01:18:05.180 --> 01:18:07.180
Rather, it is serving Jehovah

01:18:07.180 --> 01:18:09.180
that brings genuine happiness.

01:18:09.180 --> 01:18:11.180
And now, I am finding real joy

01:18:11.180 --> 01:18:14.180
and satisfaction in my service to Jehovah.

01:18:14.180 --> 01:18:18.010
So may each of us

01:18:18.010 --> 01:18:21.010
prayerfully work to have the attitude

01:18:21.010 --> 01:18:24.010
of wanting to be a peacemaker.

01:18:24.010 --> 01:18:26.010
And when we do this,

01:18:26.010 --> 01:18:28.010
we prove to Jehovah

01:18:28.010 --> 01:18:30.010
we're the kind of person

01:18:30.010 --> 01:18:32.010
that he wants in his new world.

01:18:32.010 --> 01:18:35.010
In Psalm 37-11,

01:18:35.010 --> 01:18:37.010
it says of the new world,

01:18:37.010 --> 01:18:39.010
the make will possess the earth,

01:18:39.010 --> 01:18:41.010
and they will find their exquisite delight

01:18:41.010 --> 01:18:44.010
in the abundance of peace.

01:18:44.010 --> 01:18:47.010
So the new world will be a very peaceful place.

01:18:47.010 --> 01:18:50.010
But if we're a peace promoter now,

01:18:50.010 --> 01:18:52.010
we will convince Jehovah

01:18:52.010 --> 01:18:54.010
that we will be an asset

01:18:54.010 --> 01:18:56.010
toward that peace of his new world.

01:18:56.010 --> 01:18:58.010
And think about this.

01:18:58.010 --> 01:19:00.010
In the new world,

01:19:00.010 --> 01:19:02.010
it will be natural

01:19:02.010 --> 01:19:05.010
for perfect people to just display peace.

01:19:05.010 --> 01:19:07.010
This beautiful aspect

01:19:07.010 --> 01:19:10.010
of the fruitage of Jehovah's Holy Spirit.

01:19:10.010 --> 01:19:12.010
But right now,

01:19:12.010 --> 01:19:13.010
we have to work at it, don't we?

01:19:13.010 --> 01:19:15.010
We have to seek peace, pursue it.

01:19:15.010 --> 01:19:18.010
But if we're a peace pursuer now,

01:19:18.010 --> 01:19:21.010
we will convince Jehovah

01:19:21.010 --> 01:19:24.010
that we will be a peace displayer

01:19:24.010 --> 01:19:26.010
in his righteous new world

01:19:26.010 --> 01:19:28.010
and he'll want us to be there.

01:19:28.010 --> 01:19:31.010
So let's diligently promote peace

01:19:31.010 --> 01:19:35.010
and contribute toward the strength,

01:19:35.010 --> 01:19:39.010
the happiness of Jehovah's beautiful organization

01:19:39.010 --> 01:19:41.010
which really is a modern day miracle.

01:19:42.010 --> 01:19:45.010
Remembering that those who promote peace

01:19:45.010 --> 01:19:49.010
have joy and they impart joy to others.

01:19:49.010 --> 01:19:52.010
And they make Jehovah's heart rejoice.

01:19:52.010 --> 01:19:55.010
And all of that rejoicing

01:19:55.010 --> 01:19:59.119
will last forever.

01:19:59.119 --> 01:20:00.119
Thank you, Brother Let,

01:20:00.119 --> 01:20:02.119
for helping us to see how we can contribute

01:20:02.119 --> 01:20:06.119
to peace and joy among our Brotherhood.

01:20:06.119 --> 01:20:10.119
We now come to the final talk of today's program.

01:20:10.119 --> 01:20:12.119
Can we truly be joyful

01:20:12.119 --> 01:20:15.119
in these difficult last days?

01:20:15.119 --> 01:20:19.119
How can Jesus example help us to find joy?

01:20:19.119 --> 01:20:21.119
Please give your full attention

01:20:21.119 --> 01:20:23.119
to Brother Anthony Morris of the governing body

01:20:23.119 --> 01:20:25.119
as he presents the talk,

01:20:25.119 --> 01:20:27.119
close friendship with Jehovah

01:20:27.119 --> 01:20:29.119
brings the greatest joy.

01:20:29.119 --> 01:20:39.310
What do you look forward to?

01:20:39.310 --> 01:20:43.659
As one of Jehovah's witnesses,

01:20:43.659 --> 01:20:46.659
you look forward to perfection.

01:20:46.659 --> 01:20:49.659
You look forward to eternal life

01:20:49.659 --> 01:20:52.659
in a beautiful paradise earth.

01:20:52.659 --> 01:20:58.380
However, with all of this wonderful future before us,

01:20:58.380 --> 01:21:03.210
what about in the meantime?

01:21:03.210 --> 01:21:05.210
We suffer from crime.

01:21:05.210 --> 01:21:08.210
We suffer from natural disasters.

01:21:08.210 --> 01:21:11.210
This pandemic we suffer from.

01:21:11.210 --> 01:21:15.210
Sickness, poverty, war,

01:21:15.210 --> 01:21:16.210
and other calamities.

01:21:16.210 --> 01:21:19.210
In fact, as the Scriptures mention in Romans,

01:21:19.210 --> 01:21:24.210
all creation keeps on groaning together.

01:21:24.210 --> 01:21:26.210
So the question comes up,

01:21:26.210 --> 01:21:29.210
and this is something we want you to reflect on.

01:21:29.210 --> 01:21:32.210
It's a thought-provoking question.

01:21:32.210 --> 01:21:34.210
Should the rest of our days

01:21:34.210 --> 01:21:37.210
in this wicked system of things

01:21:37.210 --> 01:21:40.210
be defined by grief?

01:21:40.210 --> 01:21:42.210
No.

01:21:42.210 --> 01:21:45.210
Absolutely not.

01:21:45.210 --> 01:21:48.210
We don't want the remainder of our time

01:21:48.210 --> 01:21:53.210
to be controlled by all the problems in the grief

01:21:53.210 --> 01:21:56.210
that mankind is suffering.

01:21:56.210 --> 01:21:58.210
Jehovah wants us,

01:21:58.210 --> 01:22:00.210
even during these times,

01:22:00.210 --> 01:22:02.210
to enjoy our lives

01:22:02.210 --> 01:22:04.210
while we wait

01:22:04.210 --> 01:22:07.210
for the fulfillment of his prophecies

01:22:07.210 --> 01:22:10.210
and his promises to us.

01:22:10.210 --> 01:22:14.210
Now, we're going to establish that for you,

01:22:14.210 --> 01:22:16.210
scripturally,

01:22:16.210 --> 01:22:18.210
even though hardship

01:22:18.210 --> 01:22:21.210
defaults us before the Great Tribulation

01:22:21.210 --> 01:22:23.210
and during the Great Tribulation.

01:22:23.210 --> 01:22:26.210
Notice this scriptural counsel found in

01:22:26.210 --> 01:22:29.210
the Bible book of Habakkuk.

01:22:29.210 --> 01:22:33.210
Habakkuk chapter three,

01:22:33.210 --> 01:22:35.210
and we're going to read

01:22:35.210 --> 01:22:41.220
verses 17 and 18.

01:22:41.220 --> 01:22:44.220
Although the fig tree may not blossom,

01:22:44.220 --> 01:22:47.220
and there be no fruit on the vines,

01:22:47.220 --> 01:22:50.220
although the olive crop may fail,

01:22:50.220 --> 01:22:53.220
and the fields may produce no food,

01:22:53.220 --> 01:22:57.220
although the flock may disappear from the pen,

01:22:57.220 --> 01:23:01.220
and there may be no cattle in the stalls.

01:23:01.220 --> 01:23:04.220
See, dire circumstances don't you agree?

01:23:04.220 --> 01:23:06.220
But notice verse 18,

01:23:06.220 --> 01:23:08.220
yet,

01:23:08.220 --> 01:23:10.220
as for me,

01:23:10.220 --> 01:23:12.220
I will exalt in Jehovah,

01:23:12.220 --> 01:23:14.220
I will be joyful

01:23:14.220 --> 01:23:17.220
in the God of my salvation.

01:23:17.220 --> 01:23:22.220
See, even during these dire circumstances,

01:23:22.220 --> 01:23:24.220
he was able to say,

01:23:24.220 --> 01:23:26.220
with all of this going on,

01:23:26.220 --> 01:23:27.220
asked for me,

01:23:27.220 --> 01:23:29.220
I will exalt in Jehovah.

01:23:29.220 --> 01:23:31.220
And I hope I can.

01:23:31.220 --> 01:23:35.220
I will exalt in Jehovah.

01:23:35.220 --> 01:23:38.220
I will be joyful

01:23:38.220 --> 01:23:40.220
in the God of my salvation.

01:23:40.220 --> 01:23:44.220
So it's really his close friendship

01:23:44.220 --> 01:23:47.220
with Jehovah God that enables him

01:23:47.220 --> 01:23:50.220
to still have joy.

01:23:50.220 --> 01:23:52.220
And that's the theme of this talk,

01:23:52.220 --> 01:23:54.220
close friendship with Jehovah brings

01:23:54.220 --> 01:23:57.220
the greatest joy.

01:23:57.220 --> 01:24:00.220
So while we're waiting patiently,

01:24:00.220 --> 01:24:04.220
Jehovah wants us to rejoice.

01:24:04.220 --> 01:24:07.220
The world couldn't understand that reasoning,

01:24:07.220 --> 01:24:11.220
but that's what Jehovah wants for his people.

01:24:11.220 --> 01:24:14.220
It's just a wonderful promise

01:24:14.220 --> 01:24:16.220
and for us to focus on.

01:24:16.220 --> 01:24:19.220
Now, the Psalmist helps us to appreciate

01:24:19.220 --> 01:24:22.220
that this isn't just some dream,

01:24:22.220 --> 01:24:24.220
to have a close friendship

01:24:24.220 --> 01:24:26.220
with the sovereign of the universe,

01:24:26.220 --> 01:24:28.220
the Almighty God.

01:24:28.220 --> 01:24:32.220
Now, notice here in Psalm 25,

01:24:32.220 --> 01:24:36.220
so we'll read that together some,

01:24:37.220 --> 01:24:39.220
25.

01:24:39.220 --> 01:24:43.220
And this is a scriptural assurance.

01:24:43.220 --> 01:24:47.079
Notice verse 14,

01:24:47.079 --> 01:24:49.079
close friendship with Jehovah

01:24:49.079 --> 01:24:52.079
belongs to those who fear him.

01:24:52.079 --> 01:24:55.079
And he makes his covenant known to them.

01:24:55.079 --> 01:24:57.079
That's beautiful.

01:24:57.079 --> 01:25:01.079
Close friendship with Jehovah.

01:25:01.079 --> 01:25:03.079
It's possible.

01:25:03.079 --> 01:25:04.079
It's a reality.

01:25:04.079 --> 01:25:06.079
He teaches us.

01:25:06.079 --> 01:25:08.079
He teaches us dreaming when we speak

01:25:08.079 --> 01:25:11.079
about having this close friendship

01:25:11.079 --> 01:25:13.079
with Jehovah God.

01:25:13.079 --> 01:25:15.079
It's a wonderful, wonderful reality

01:25:15.079 --> 01:25:19.079
that we enjoy and it brings such joy

01:25:19.079 --> 01:25:23.079
to have this closeness with Jehovah God.

01:25:23.079 --> 01:25:25.079
Now, what helps with this

01:25:25.079 --> 01:25:28.079
and be able to make sure we have this

01:25:28.079 --> 01:25:30.079
close friendship,

01:25:30.079 --> 01:25:34.079
it comes to acquiring the mental disposition

01:25:34.079 --> 01:25:36.079
of Jesus.

01:25:36.079 --> 01:25:38.079
No one's ever been closer to Jehovah

01:25:38.079 --> 01:25:39.079
than Jesus,

01:25:39.079 --> 01:25:41.079
pre-human existence

01:25:41.079 --> 01:25:43.079
during his earthly ministry

01:25:43.079 --> 01:25:45.079
and upon his resurrection.

01:25:45.079 --> 01:25:47.079
So close to Jehovah.

01:25:47.079 --> 01:25:49.079
So for us to really capture

01:25:49.079 --> 01:25:51.079
how we can have a close friendship

01:25:51.079 --> 01:25:52.079
with Jehovah,

01:25:52.079 --> 01:25:55.079
we need to learn to think

01:25:55.079 --> 01:25:57.079
and feel like Jesus did

01:25:57.079 --> 01:25:59.079
and still does.

01:25:59.079 --> 01:26:02.079
So when we imitate his example,

01:26:02.079 --> 01:26:05.079
it increases our joy.

01:26:05.079 --> 01:26:08.079
So in this talk,

01:26:08.079 --> 01:26:10.079
we're going to discuss

01:26:10.079 --> 01:26:15.079
two aspects of Jesus' mental disposition.

01:26:15.079 --> 01:26:17.079
The first aspect

01:26:17.079 --> 01:26:19.079
is how Jesus showed

01:26:19.079 --> 01:26:20.079
on selfish love

01:26:20.079 --> 01:26:22.079
and that drew him close to his father.

01:26:22.079 --> 01:26:24.079
He found absolute joy

01:26:24.079 --> 01:26:26.079
in showing neighbor love

01:26:26.079 --> 01:26:29.079
and doing good to others.

01:26:29.079 --> 01:26:31.079
Now, notice this artwork here, please.

01:26:32.079 --> 01:26:37.829
Jesus gave from his heart,

01:26:37.829 --> 01:26:45.020
unselfishly.

01:26:45.020 --> 01:26:47.020
Imagine Jesus' feelings

01:26:47.020 --> 01:26:49.020
when he met someone who needed help.

01:26:49.020 --> 01:27:36.020
You see, Jesus and the joy

01:27:36.020 --> 01:27:37.020
of helping others,

01:27:37.020 --> 01:27:39.020
it's just very evident

01:27:39.020 --> 01:27:41.020
and the closeness with his father,

01:27:41.020 --> 01:27:42.020
they could see it,

01:27:42.020 --> 01:27:44.020
the disciples rejoiced,

01:27:44.020 --> 01:27:47.020
what a perfect example

01:27:47.020 --> 01:27:49.020
of being close to Jehovah

01:27:49.020 --> 01:27:53.020
and the result, joy.

01:27:53.020 --> 01:27:56.020
So that's what we want to keep in mind

01:27:56.020 --> 01:28:00.020
and Jesus said that example for us.

01:28:00.020 --> 01:28:04.020
Now, by being generous,

01:28:04.020 --> 01:28:07.020
Jesus taught us practice

01:28:07.020 --> 01:28:08.020
what he did,

01:28:08.020 --> 01:28:11.020
practice what he preached and taught.

01:28:11.020 --> 01:28:13.020
Notice here in Luke,

01:28:13.020 --> 01:28:15.020
chapter 6,

01:28:15.020 --> 01:28:16.020
and we learned

01:28:16.020 --> 01:28:18.020
because he lived this.

01:28:18.020 --> 01:28:20.020
It's such freeness of speech

01:28:20.020 --> 01:28:24.850
to make these things clear

01:28:24.850 --> 01:28:26.850
to those that listened to him.

01:28:26.850 --> 01:28:29.850
Luke, chapter 6,

01:28:29.850 --> 01:28:32.850
and talk about being generous.

01:28:32.850 --> 01:28:34.850
Jesus obviously was,

01:28:34.850 --> 01:28:36.850
but notice, verse 38,

01:28:36.850 --> 01:28:39.850
Luke, chapter 6,

01:28:39.850 --> 01:28:41.850
practice giving,

01:28:41.850 --> 01:28:43.850
and people will give to you.

01:28:43.850 --> 01:28:45.850
They will pour into your laps

01:28:45.850 --> 01:28:47.850
of fine measure,

01:28:47.850 --> 01:28:49.850
down, shaken together,

01:28:49.850 --> 01:28:51.850
and overflowing.

01:28:51.850 --> 01:28:54.850
For with the measure that you are measuring out,

01:28:54.850 --> 01:28:56.850
they will measure out to you

01:28:56.850 --> 01:28:59.850
in return.

01:28:59.850 --> 01:29:02.850
So beautiful lesson here,

01:29:02.850 --> 01:29:05.850
be generous.

01:29:05.850 --> 01:29:07.850
Jesus was so generous with his time

01:29:07.850 --> 01:29:09.850
and all the things he did

01:29:09.850 --> 01:29:11.850
with his disciples,

01:29:11.850 --> 01:29:13.850
and the lesson being,

01:29:13.850 --> 01:29:15.850
the measure you show

01:29:15.850 --> 01:29:17.850
of being generous,

01:29:17.850 --> 01:29:19.850
it comes in return.

01:29:19.850 --> 01:29:22.850
So sometimes people in the world,

01:29:22.850 --> 01:29:25.850
they have stated things,

01:29:25.850 --> 01:29:27.850
I know I heard these things

01:29:27.850 --> 01:29:28.850
when I first became

01:29:28.850 --> 01:29:30.850
one of Jehovah's Witnesses,

01:29:30.850 --> 01:29:31.850
you people,

01:29:31.850 --> 01:29:33.850
you don't celebrate holidays,

01:29:33.850 --> 01:29:36.850
you're stingy.

01:29:36.850 --> 01:29:37.850
Nothing could be further

01:29:37.850 --> 01:29:38.850
from the truth.

01:29:38.850 --> 01:29:40.850
We don't celebrate holidays

01:29:40.850 --> 01:29:42.850
that offend our God,

01:29:42.850 --> 01:29:44.850
the one we love in worship.

01:29:44.850 --> 01:29:46.850
So just because we don't

01:29:46.850 --> 01:29:48.850
celebrate these holidays,

01:29:48.850 --> 01:29:49.850
where there's gift-giving,

01:29:49.850 --> 01:29:51.850
doesn't mean we're not generous.

01:29:51.850 --> 01:29:54.850
We're happy to give gifts.

01:29:54.850 --> 01:29:57.850
We enjoy giving,

01:29:57.850 --> 01:29:59.850
because that's what Jehovah

01:29:59.850 --> 01:30:00.850
wants us to do.

01:30:00.850 --> 01:30:02.850
We look for opportunities

01:30:02.850 --> 01:30:04.850
to be generous.

01:30:04.850 --> 01:30:06.850
Now, along with

01:30:06.850 --> 01:30:09.850
keeping your Bibles here at Luke chapter 6,

01:30:09.850 --> 01:30:11.850
we need to be patient

01:30:11.850 --> 01:30:13.850
with each other.

01:30:13.850 --> 01:30:15.850
Some things we're going to discuss here.

01:30:15.850 --> 01:30:17.850
I need to apply the counsel

01:30:17.850 --> 01:30:19.850
and we're passing this on for

01:30:19.850 --> 01:30:21.850
your benefit.

01:30:21.850 --> 01:30:22.850
Some things to think about,

01:30:22.850 --> 01:30:23.850
and if you see an area

01:30:23.850 --> 01:30:25.850
where you need to

01:30:25.850 --> 01:30:27.850
make improvement,

01:30:27.850 --> 01:30:29.850
well, then by all means do so.

01:30:29.850 --> 01:30:31.850
That'll keep you close to Jehovah

01:30:31.850 --> 01:30:34.850
and having the abundant great joy

01:30:34.850 --> 01:30:37.850
as a result of applying his counsel.

01:30:37.850 --> 01:30:39.850
Now, verse 37,

01:30:39.850 --> 01:30:41.850
right before verse 38,

01:30:42.850 --> 01:30:44.850
notice,

01:30:44.850 --> 01:30:45.850
moreover,

01:30:45.850 --> 01:30:47.850
stop judging,

01:30:47.850 --> 01:30:49.850
and you will by no means

01:30:49.850 --> 01:30:50.850
be judged,

01:30:50.850 --> 01:30:52.850
and stop condemning,

01:30:52.850 --> 01:30:53.850
and you'll by no means

01:30:53.850 --> 01:30:55.850
be condemned.

01:30:55.850 --> 01:30:57.850
Keep on forgiving,

01:30:57.850 --> 01:30:59.850
and you will be forgiven.

01:30:59.850 --> 01:31:01.850
So,

01:31:01.850 --> 01:31:03.850
very priceless counsel

01:31:03.850 --> 01:31:04.850
and the need to be forgiving,

01:31:04.850 --> 01:31:06.850
Jehovah and Jesus certainly are.

01:31:06.850 --> 01:31:09.850
You'll also notice in verse 37,

01:31:10.850 --> 01:31:14.850
stated, stop judging,

01:31:14.850 --> 01:31:16.850
to stop it.

01:31:16.850 --> 01:31:17.850
He didn't say,

01:31:17.850 --> 01:31:19.850
don't judge.

01:31:19.850 --> 01:31:21.850
He said, stop judging.

01:31:21.850 --> 01:31:23.850
Why?

01:31:23.850 --> 01:31:27.850
Because that's in perfect human inclination

01:31:27.850 --> 01:31:29.850
to judge,

01:31:29.850 --> 01:31:31.850
to judge others.

01:31:31.850 --> 01:31:34.850
Sometimes, even in the congregation,

01:31:34.850 --> 01:31:37.850
some can become overly critical.

01:31:37.850 --> 01:31:40.850
They can become resentful,

01:31:40.850 --> 01:31:42.850
envious,

01:31:42.850 --> 01:31:45.850
and envy is so destructive.

01:31:45.850 --> 01:31:48.850
Somebody might have materialistic prosperity.

01:31:48.850 --> 01:31:50.850
They might enjoy privileges

01:31:50.850 --> 01:31:53.850
that you don't have in the congregation.

01:31:53.850 --> 01:31:56.850
Others might find them very endearing,

01:31:56.850 --> 01:31:59.850
and envy can creep in.

01:31:59.850 --> 01:32:01.850
And frankly,

01:32:01.850 --> 01:32:03.850
it's unhealthy physically,

01:32:03.850 --> 01:32:05.850
and spiritually.

01:32:05.850 --> 01:32:07.850
And that's what I mean by that,

01:32:07.850 --> 01:32:09.850
with this proverb,

01:32:09.850 --> 01:32:11.850
fine proverbs,

01:32:11.850 --> 01:32:13.850
if you would please,

01:32:13.850 --> 01:32:16.850
and the inspired counsel is very,

01:32:16.850 --> 01:32:18.850
very clear,

01:32:18.850 --> 01:32:20.850
Proverbs 14,

01:32:20.850 --> 01:32:23.850
and the 30th verse.

01:32:23.850 --> 01:32:26.850
A calm heart gives life to the body,

01:32:26.850 --> 01:32:28.850
even on notice,

01:32:28.850 --> 01:32:30.850
but jealousy or envy,

01:32:30.850 --> 01:32:32.850
these are things,

01:32:32.850 --> 01:32:34.850
is rottenness to the bones.

01:32:34.850 --> 01:32:35.850
They're rotten,

01:32:35.850 --> 01:32:37.850
and the bone is so important,

01:32:37.850 --> 01:32:39.850
all the bones in our body,

01:32:39.850 --> 01:32:41.850
toward good physical health.

01:32:41.850 --> 01:32:42.850
Same thing,

01:32:42.850 --> 01:32:43.850
spiritually,

01:32:43.850 --> 01:32:46.850
if we're jealous,

01:32:46.850 --> 01:32:47.850
it's rotten to us,

01:32:47.850 --> 01:32:49.850
in a spiritual way,

01:32:49.850 --> 01:32:51.850
as well.

01:32:51.850 --> 01:32:53.850
See, things that Jehovah

01:32:53.850 --> 01:32:54.850
doesn't feel,

01:32:54.850 --> 01:32:56.850
he would be one,

01:32:56.850 --> 01:32:59.850
close friendship with somebody

01:32:59.850 --> 01:33:01.850
that has this issue,

01:33:01.850 --> 01:33:02.850
and doesn't work on it,

01:33:02.850 --> 01:33:05.850
doesn't work to correct it.

01:33:05.850 --> 01:33:08.850
So, when we work on,

01:33:08.850 --> 01:33:10.850
thinking about some of these things,

01:33:10.850 --> 01:33:12.850
we can actually personally

01:33:12.850 --> 01:33:14.850
increase the joy

01:33:14.850 --> 01:33:16.850
in our congregation.

01:33:16.850 --> 01:33:18.850
And that takes us to another

01:33:18.850 --> 01:33:20.850
scriptural thought

01:33:20.850 --> 01:33:22.850
that we want to address here in this talk,

01:33:22.850 --> 01:33:24.850
about having a close friendship

01:33:24.850 --> 01:33:25.850
with Jehovah.

01:33:25.850 --> 01:33:27.850
Notice 1st Peter,

01:33:27.850 --> 01:33:29.850
chapter 4.

01:33:29.850 --> 01:33:31.850
And you'll remember this verse,

01:33:31.850 --> 01:33:33.850
listening 1st Peter,

01:33:33.850 --> 01:33:34.850
chapter 4,

01:33:34.850 --> 01:33:38.850
and verse 15.

01:33:38.850 --> 01:33:40.850
1st Peter 4,

01:33:40.850 --> 01:33:41.850
15.

01:33:41.850 --> 01:33:42.850
However,

01:33:42.850 --> 01:33:44.850
let none of you suffer

01:33:44.850 --> 01:33:45.850
as a murderer,

01:33:45.850 --> 01:33:47.850
or a thief,

01:33:47.850 --> 01:33:49.850
or a wrongdoer,

01:33:49.850 --> 01:33:50.850
no notice,

01:33:50.850 --> 01:33:52.850
or a busy body,

01:33:52.850 --> 01:33:54.850
in other people's matters.

01:33:54.850 --> 01:33:56.850
So, obviously murder

01:33:56.850 --> 01:33:58.850
and being a thief,

01:33:58.850 --> 01:34:00.850
these are terrible sins

01:34:00.850 --> 01:34:02.850
against Jehovah God.

01:34:02.850 --> 01:34:04.850
But right after that,

01:34:04.850 --> 01:34:06.850
he mentions a busy body.

01:34:06.850 --> 01:34:09.850
Now, literally in the original language,

01:34:09.850 --> 01:34:11.850
and this has always helped me

01:34:11.850 --> 01:34:13.850
with his inspired thought,

01:34:13.850 --> 01:34:15.850
a busy body,

01:34:15.850 --> 01:34:18.850
literally overseer

01:34:18.850 --> 01:34:21.850
in what is another's.

01:34:21.850 --> 01:34:23.850
What does that tell you?

01:34:23.850 --> 01:34:25.850
Well, if it's not your

01:34:25.850 --> 01:34:27.850
responsibility to oversee

01:34:27.850 --> 01:34:29.850
this particular issue,

01:34:29.850 --> 01:34:32.850
then you could keep in mind

01:34:32.850 --> 01:34:33.850
the need,

01:34:33.850 --> 01:34:37.850
mine your own business.

01:34:37.850 --> 01:34:42.850
The scriptures are against busy bodies.

01:34:42.850 --> 01:34:45.850
They disturb the peace of congregations,

01:34:45.850 --> 01:34:47.850
they interfere with the congregations,

01:34:47.850 --> 01:34:49.850
enjoying the joy.

01:34:49.850 --> 01:34:52.850
So, we refrain from imposing

01:34:52.850 --> 01:34:55.850
our uninspired opinions on others,

01:34:55.850 --> 01:34:57.850
or debating about matters

01:34:57.850 --> 01:35:00.850
of personal choice.

01:35:00.850 --> 01:35:02.850
You have some concerns,

01:35:02.850 --> 01:35:03.850
talk to Jehovah God about it,

01:35:03.850 --> 01:35:06.850
but if it's a personal concern,

01:35:06.850 --> 01:35:08.850
don't be a busy body.

01:35:08.850 --> 01:35:10.850
The scriptures are very clear,

01:35:10.850 --> 01:35:12.850
stay away from that,

01:35:12.850 --> 01:35:15.850
and developing this negative spirit

01:35:15.850 --> 01:35:19.850
that could disrupt the peace of the congregation.

01:35:19.850 --> 01:35:22.850
Now, as you watch the following video,

01:35:22.850 --> 01:35:24.850
notice how our sister worked

01:35:24.850 --> 01:35:27.850
at becoming more positive,

01:35:27.850 --> 01:35:29.850
and by doing so,

01:35:29.850 --> 01:35:32.850
she increased her joy.

01:35:32.850 --> 01:35:36.479
I've had a lifelong struggle

01:35:36.479 --> 01:35:39.479
with a negative attitude.

01:35:39.479 --> 01:35:41.479
My negative disposition

01:35:41.479 --> 01:35:43.479
made me a very impatient,

01:35:43.479 --> 01:35:46.479
sarcastic, and demanding person.

01:35:46.479 --> 01:35:48.479
One day, out in Phil's service,

01:35:48.479 --> 01:35:51.479
I had insulted a partner of mine,

01:35:51.479 --> 01:35:54.479
and the entire day was ruined.

01:35:55.479 --> 01:35:57.479
My mother was in the car.

01:35:57.479 --> 01:36:00.479
She was very upset with the situation.

01:36:00.479 --> 01:36:03.479
She told me that I had a negative attitude,

01:36:03.479 --> 01:36:06.479
and that I was not allowed inside the house

01:36:06.479 --> 01:36:08.479
until that sister forgave me.

01:36:08.479 --> 01:36:11.479
So, I asked the sister a lunch.

01:36:11.479 --> 01:36:13.479
It was one of the most difficult

01:36:13.479 --> 01:36:17.479
and uncomfortable situations I have been in.

01:36:17.479 --> 01:36:21.479
I realized that I needed to make a self-examination.

01:36:21.479 --> 01:36:23.479
Why was I negative?

01:36:23.479 --> 01:36:25.479
Why was I so unhappy?

01:36:25.479 --> 01:36:27.479
It was because I stopped pioneering,

01:36:27.479 --> 01:36:29.479
and my friends continued

01:36:29.479 --> 01:36:31.479
in their full-time service to Jehovah,

01:36:31.479 --> 01:36:33.479
and that made me very frustrated.

01:36:33.479 --> 01:36:36.479
To see them continue this while I was stuck.

01:36:36.479 --> 01:36:40.479
But when I acknowledged that I had this negative attitude,

01:36:40.479 --> 01:36:42.479
that prompted me to beg Jehovah

01:36:42.479 --> 01:36:44.479
to help me to make changes.

01:36:44.479 --> 01:36:46.479
The friends in the congregation

01:36:46.479 --> 01:36:49.479
that I spent a lot of time with were not bad people.

01:36:49.479 --> 01:36:53.479
Their imperfection fueled my negative attitude,

01:36:53.479 --> 01:36:58.140
and I really had to put that fire out.

01:36:58.140 --> 01:37:00.140
Personal studies was a major help

01:37:00.140 --> 01:37:04.140
with my prayer to Jehovah to make these changes.

01:37:04.140 --> 01:37:06.140
One of the things I meditated on

01:37:06.140 --> 01:37:09.140
was how I just acted with his disciples.

01:37:09.140 --> 01:37:12.140
When he was hungry and he was tired,

01:37:12.140 --> 01:37:14.140
he was still very loving and kind.

01:37:14.140 --> 01:37:16.140
So, I saw for myself,

01:37:16.140 --> 01:37:18.140
when I was spiritually hungry,

01:37:18.140 --> 01:37:23.140
how that affected my words and my actions towards the brothers and sisters.

01:37:23.140 --> 01:37:26.140
The keys to maintaining Jesus' mental disposition,

01:37:26.140 --> 01:37:29.140
our prayer, gratitude, and contentment.

01:37:29.140 --> 01:37:32.140
My goal is to show a grateful attitude

01:37:32.140 --> 01:37:35.140
for the blessings that I receive every day,

01:37:35.140 --> 01:37:38.140
and also to look for the good in people,

01:37:38.140 --> 01:37:40.140
to show them that I care and I love them,

01:37:40.140 --> 01:37:42.140
and I've learned the more that I give

01:37:42.140 --> 01:37:44.140
to the friends into my family,

01:37:44.140 --> 01:37:46.140
the happier that makes Jehovah.

01:37:46.140 --> 01:37:50.140
As Acts 2035, and Hebrews 1316 mentioned,

01:37:50.140 --> 01:37:52.140
and when Jehovah is happy,

01:37:52.140 --> 01:37:54.140
that really makes me happy.

01:37:54.140 --> 01:38:01.630
Very thought-provoking video, don't you agree?

01:38:01.630 --> 01:38:04.630
Now, you'll notice what lessons she'd learned

01:38:04.630 --> 01:38:06.630
and we all benefit from it.

01:38:06.630 --> 01:38:11.630
Prayer, gratitude, contentment.

01:38:11.630 --> 01:38:14.630
Beautiful, that she could see that.

01:38:14.630 --> 01:38:18.630
And when you have a prayer coupled with gratitude,

01:38:18.630 --> 01:38:21.630
and then you show and display contentment,

01:38:21.630 --> 01:38:23.630
you stay close to Jehovah,

01:38:23.630 --> 01:38:29.630
and that brings great joy because we apply the counsel.

01:38:29.630 --> 01:38:33.630
Now, the second that we're going to discuss in this talk

01:38:33.630 --> 01:38:40.630
is using practical wisdom increases our joy.

01:38:40.630 --> 01:38:42.630
So we made it clear that we want to show

01:38:42.630 --> 01:38:44.630
on Selfish Love as Jesus did.

01:38:44.630 --> 01:38:47.630
Now, we're talking about practical wisdom.

01:38:47.630 --> 01:38:50.630
And how that increases our joy.

01:38:50.630 --> 01:38:53.630
Jesus knew how important this counsel was.

01:38:53.630 --> 01:38:57.630
He taught His disciples when it comes up to treasures.

01:38:57.630 --> 01:39:00.630
You know, store up treasures in heaven.

01:39:00.630 --> 01:39:02.630
See, because where your heart is,

01:39:02.630 --> 01:39:05.630
and your treasure is, that's where your heart's going to be.

01:39:05.630 --> 01:39:07.630
So he made that very clear,

01:39:07.630 --> 01:39:08.630
trying to help them appreciate

01:39:08.630 --> 01:39:11.630
a little practical, simple life.

01:39:11.630 --> 01:39:16.630
Now, notice here in this artwork how Jesus is showing His disciples

01:39:16.630 --> 01:39:19.630
and how much joy they have,

01:39:19.630 --> 01:39:23.630
applying that counsel about keeping it simple.

01:39:23.630 --> 01:39:31.189
Jesus knew that storing up treasures in heaven brings joy.

01:39:31.189 --> 01:39:35.859
Imagine the joy Jesus found,

01:39:35.859 --> 01:40:24.829
ensuring life's simple pleasures with others.

01:40:24.829 --> 01:40:27.829
So they enjoyed their surroundings.

01:40:27.829 --> 01:40:29.829
They were rejoicing.

01:40:29.829 --> 01:40:34.829
Nobody is comparing who has certain amount of gold.

01:40:34.829 --> 01:40:37.829
Now, this is just enjoying life

01:40:37.829 --> 01:40:41.829
because of their close relationship with Jehovah God.

01:40:41.829 --> 01:40:45.829
Now, by keeping our life simple,

01:40:45.829 --> 01:40:49.829
we trust that Jehovah will provide for our needs

01:40:49.829 --> 01:40:52.829
and something I've said for years.

01:40:52.829 --> 01:40:56.829
Remember, Jehovah provides for our needs,

01:40:56.829 --> 01:40:58.829
not our grids.

01:40:58.829 --> 01:41:02.829
So if we're content with the needs Jehovah provides for us,

01:41:02.829 --> 01:41:08.829
we can experience great joy.

01:41:08.829 --> 01:41:11.829
We want to avoid distractions that could take us away

01:41:11.829 --> 01:41:15.829
from wholeheartedly serving our Heavenly Father

01:41:15.829 --> 01:41:19.829
or even start to distance us from Him.

01:41:19.829 --> 01:41:22.829
The Bible is filled with practical wisdom

01:41:22.829 --> 01:41:26.829
about physical health, finances, family life.

01:41:26.829 --> 01:41:29.829
And when this counsel's applied it can,

01:41:29.829 --> 01:41:31.829
in many cases, prevent problems,

01:41:31.829 --> 01:41:37.829
at least minimize them even in these difficult last days.

01:41:37.829 --> 01:41:40.829
And the Scriptures are very clear

01:41:40.829 --> 01:41:44.829
that when we really peer into Jehovah's Word

01:41:44.829 --> 01:41:48.829
and it's been referred to in the Bible book of James as a mirror,

01:41:48.829 --> 01:41:50.829
here's the benefit.

01:41:50.829 --> 01:41:54.829
Now, you'll remember this in James chapter 1

01:41:54.829 --> 01:42:00.829
and how much we appreciate the wisdom that is found here

01:42:00.829 --> 01:42:06.829
in James chapter 1 and verse 25.

01:42:06.829 --> 01:42:08.829
James 1, 25.

01:42:08.829 --> 01:42:11.829
But the one who peers into the perfect law

01:42:11.829 --> 01:42:15.829
that belongs to freedom and continues in it

01:42:15.829 --> 01:42:19.829
has become not a forgetful here,

01:42:19.829 --> 01:42:21.829
but a doer of the Word.

01:42:21.829 --> 01:42:24.829
And he will be happy in what he does.

01:42:24.829 --> 01:42:27.829
So when we take the time to look

01:42:27.829 --> 01:42:29.829
into Jehovah's Word, peer in,

01:42:29.829 --> 01:42:31.829
it's not just a glance,

01:42:31.829 --> 01:42:34.829
we're peering into the perfect law,

01:42:34.829 --> 01:42:36.829
then we continue in it.

01:42:36.829 --> 01:42:39.829
We don't read it and say,

01:42:39.829 --> 01:42:40.829
oh, that was interesting,

01:42:40.829 --> 01:42:43.829
and then go off and forget it.

01:42:43.829 --> 01:42:47.829
No, a doer of the Word.

01:42:47.829 --> 01:42:50.829
That means there's application of what we just read.

01:42:50.829 --> 01:42:55.829
And the result, we will be happy.

01:42:55.829 --> 01:42:56.829
Guaranteed.

01:42:56.829 --> 01:42:59.829
That's what Jehovah promises.

01:42:59.829 --> 01:43:04.829
So it has to be applied to have this benefit.

01:43:04.829 --> 01:43:07.829
Now, there's a beautiful proverb.

01:43:07.829 --> 01:43:10.829
And this gets personal for all of us too.

01:43:10.829 --> 01:43:14.829
I need to apply it just like all of you are listening.

01:43:14.829 --> 01:43:16.829
I need to do likewise.

01:43:16.829 --> 01:43:19.829
Proverbs chapter 15.

01:43:19.829 --> 01:43:21.829
And this can happen,

01:43:21.829 --> 01:43:24.829
especially in these critical last days

01:43:24.829 --> 01:43:27.829
that are continuing to get worse and worse,

01:43:27.829 --> 01:43:29.829
but I've always loved this proverb,

01:43:29.829 --> 01:43:32.829
and it's helped me for decades.

01:43:32.829 --> 01:43:35.829
And I think many of you

01:43:35.829 --> 01:43:37.829
agree that it's helped you,

01:43:37.829 --> 01:43:39.829
and if not, then benefit

01:43:39.829 --> 01:43:42.829
from the wisdom here of Proverbs 15.

01:43:42.829 --> 01:43:45.829
And let's read verse 15.

01:43:45.829 --> 01:43:50.829
All the days of the afflicted one are bad,

01:43:50.829 --> 01:43:53.829
but the one with a cheerful heart

01:43:53.829 --> 01:43:56.829
has a continual feast.

01:43:56.829 --> 01:44:00.829
Now, we have to let that sink in all the days.

01:44:00.829 --> 01:44:04.829
So this means day after day, this negative attitude,

01:44:04.829 --> 01:44:06.829
poor me, poor me,

01:44:06.829 --> 01:44:08.829
one affliction after the other,

01:44:08.829 --> 01:44:12.829
like the sister in the video we saw earlier,

01:44:12.829 --> 01:44:16.829
just absorbed with negative things.

01:44:16.829 --> 01:44:21.829
But then it's contrasted with having a cheerful heart,

01:44:21.829 --> 01:44:23.829
and it's like having a feast.

01:44:23.829 --> 01:44:26.829
So mentally and emotionally,

01:44:26.829 --> 01:44:29.829
we're going to benefit from not

01:44:29.829 --> 01:44:33.829
needlessly focusing on the afflictions

01:44:33.829 --> 01:44:35.829
and the things that we deal with.

01:44:35.829 --> 01:44:37.829
It connects with the earlier we talked about prayer,

01:44:37.829 --> 01:44:40.829
gratitude, and contentment.

01:44:40.829 --> 01:44:42.829
So agonizing over problems

01:44:42.829 --> 01:44:45.829
that are beyond our control

01:44:45.829 --> 01:44:51.369
does not please God.

01:44:51.369 --> 01:44:55.369
We do the best we can with our circumstances,

01:44:55.369 --> 01:44:58.369
but to be daily afflicted and agonizing

01:44:58.369 --> 01:45:03.369
over these things that really are no control over,

01:45:03.369 --> 01:45:07.369
we do the best we can to resolve our problems,

01:45:07.369 --> 01:45:10.369
but try to focus on the more productive things.

01:45:10.369 --> 01:45:12.369
What can we do?

01:45:12.369 --> 01:45:14.369
What are the positive things?

01:45:14.369 --> 01:45:17.369
And this isn't just some psychological endeavor.

01:45:17.369 --> 01:45:20.369
This is scriptural direction.

01:45:20.369 --> 01:45:22.369
Scriptural advice.

01:45:22.369 --> 01:45:25.369
And when applied, it really works.

01:45:25.369 --> 01:45:28.369
See, Jehovah blesses our efforts.

01:45:28.369 --> 01:45:32.369
And if you think about it, especially to some older noun,

01:45:32.369 --> 01:45:34.369
I can relate to it.

01:45:34.369 --> 01:45:37.369
Some of you older ones, just keep in mind,

01:45:37.369 --> 01:45:41.369
just because you're tired doesn't mean

01:45:41.369 --> 01:45:44.369
you don't love Jehovah that you're not close to him.

01:45:44.369 --> 01:45:46.369
Things have changed.

01:45:46.369 --> 01:45:48.369
So keep your close friendship with him

01:45:48.369 --> 01:45:54.369
and don't dwell on the afflictions of being elderly,

01:45:54.369 --> 01:45:58.369
not healthy, spiritually or physically.

01:45:58.369 --> 01:46:02.369
Jehovah will help us to get through those times.

01:46:02.369 --> 01:46:06.369
Now, what will help, too,

01:46:06.369 --> 01:46:10.369
is to take the thinking down another path.

01:46:10.369 --> 01:46:13.369
And there's a Psalm here that I'm going to share with you.

01:46:13.369 --> 01:46:16.369
Psalm 77.

01:46:16.369 --> 01:46:21.369
So if you'll find Psalm 77.

01:46:21.369 --> 01:46:30.369
And this is more beautiful and spired advice.

01:46:31.369 --> 01:46:33.369
Psalm 77.

01:46:33.369 --> 01:46:37.840
And here in the 12th verse.

01:46:37.840 --> 01:46:41.840
And I will meditate on all your activity.

01:46:41.840 --> 01:46:44.840
And ponder over your dealings.

01:46:44.840 --> 01:46:46.840
So again, another one of those verses

01:46:46.840 --> 01:46:48.840
were to pause.

01:46:48.840 --> 01:46:49.840
Think about it.

01:46:49.840 --> 01:46:53.840
So you're talking about the times we're living in.

01:46:53.840 --> 01:46:57.840
So we must meditate on Jehovah's activity.

01:46:57.840 --> 01:46:59.840
We'll come back to that in a moment.

01:46:59.840 --> 01:47:01.840
Ponder over your dealings.

01:47:01.840 --> 01:47:03.840
What would that maybe mean?

01:47:03.840 --> 01:47:08.840
Well, Jehovah, how does he deal with his servants?

01:47:08.840 --> 01:47:10.840
How does he deal with us?

01:47:10.840 --> 01:47:12.840
He's kind.

01:47:12.840 --> 01:47:14.840
And don't you love being around somebody

01:47:14.840 --> 01:47:18.840
that's reasonable and kind.

01:47:18.840 --> 01:47:19.840
See?

01:47:19.840 --> 01:47:23.840
And the way they deal with others, they're kind.

01:47:23.840 --> 01:47:25.840
Well, when they're that way,

01:47:25.840 --> 01:47:28.840
they're really imitating how close they are to Jehovah

01:47:28.840 --> 01:47:32.840
because he's kind when he deals with us.

01:47:32.840 --> 01:47:34.840
And we're so grateful for that.

01:47:34.840 --> 01:47:39.840
And talking about meditating on the activity,

01:47:39.840 --> 01:47:42.840
we'll think about the creation.

01:47:42.840 --> 01:47:45.840
And what Jehovah's done with the creation.

01:47:45.840 --> 01:47:50.840
People that accept evolution, they couldn't do such.

01:47:50.840 --> 01:47:53.840
They couldn't find any benefit from,

01:47:53.840 --> 01:47:55.840
because they don't believe in creation.

01:47:55.840 --> 01:47:57.840
All of this just happened.

01:47:57.840 --> 01:47:59.840
And not so for us.

01:47:59.840 --> 01:48:01.840
When we look at the creation,

01:48:01.840 --> 01:48:03.840
something is simple,

01:48:03.840 --> 01:48:06.840
and this does make Jehovah happy when we do it.

01:48:06.840 --> 01:48:10.840
A beautiful flower or a bouquet of flowers.

01:48:10.840 --> 01:48:13.840
Sometimes the world, they start these businesses

01:48:13.840 --> 01:48:15.840
and they have these fake flowers.

01:48:15.840 --> 01:48:18.840
Some of them look pretty good,

01:48:18.840 --> 01:48:22.840
but compared to a real flower,

01:48:22.840 --> 01:48:26.840
I've seen some make these roses that look pretty good.

01:48:27.840 --> 01:48:31.840
But I don't smell what I smell with the real rose.

01:48:31.840 --> 01:48:34.840
The whole thing with a beautiful rose

01:48:34.840 --> 01:48:38.840
it just makes you reflect on the creator.

01:48:38.840 --> 01:48:43.840
And something that's always been a treasure for me is

01:48:43.840 --> 01:48:46.840
when you can capture a beautiful sunset.

01:48:46.840 --> 01:48:49.840
Might be a sunrise or might be a sunset,

01:48:49.840 --> 01:48:55.840
but it just causes people to go wow.

01:48:56.840 --> 01:48:59.840
And some of them stop and think about God,

01:48:59.840 --> 01:49:02.840
whether they don't believe in Him or not.

01:49:02.840 --> 01:49:04.840
It just stuns them.

01:49:04.840 --> 01:49:09.840
And shortly after we had moved here to headquarters in Warwick,

01:49:09.840 --> 01:49:13.840
I remember in just a few days after being here,

01:49:13.840 --> 01:49:15.840
we had some rain and such,

01:49:15.840 --> 01:49:17.840
but then they took a picture.

01:49:17.840 --> 01:49:20.840
I've had a beautiful rainbow.

01:49:20.840 --> 01:49:24.840
Then they took a picture of with my tablet.

01:49:24.840 --> 01:49:28.840
How can you not feel good and refreshed

01:49:28.840 --> 01:49:32.840
by looking at such activity of Jehovah God?

01:49:32.840 --> 01:49:35.840
Beautiful, beautiful, rainbow.

01:49:35.840 --> 01:49:39.840
And then there's the antics of animals.

01:49:39.840 --> 01:49:44.840
I love dogs, I love puppies and kittens,

01:49:44.840 --> 01:49:45.840
the things they do,

01:49:45.840 --> 01:49:48.840
and sometimes they're able to capture them on video.

01:49:48.840 --> 01:49:52.840
It just causes joy in the heart.

01:49:52.840 --> 01:49:57.840
So find joy more in all of the creation of them,

01:49:57.840 --> 01:50:03.840
but most of all, find joy in your relationship with Jehovah God.

01:50:03.840 --> 01:50:04.840
Now with that in mind,

01:50:04.840 --> 01:50:13.789
notice how our brother uses practical wisdom in the following video.

01:50:13.789 --> 01:50:15.789
I had a stable job at a local resort,

01:50:15.789 --> 01:50:18.789
but I later lost this job.

01:50:18.789 --> 01:50:20.789
I tried to look for work,

01:50:20.789 --> 01:50:22.789
but I was unsuccessful.

01:50:22.789 --> 01:50:25.789
My savings ran out.

01:50:25.789 --> 01:50:29.789
We had run out of money to buy a gas for cooking.

01:50:29.789 --> 01:50:35.359
It felt like my world had ended.

01:50:35.359 --> 01:50:38.359
I did some research in publications.

01:50:38.359 --> 01:50:42.359
I found that I was able to follow the example of some brothers

01:50:42.359 --> 01:50:44.359
who had found that they were able to start businesses

01:50:44.359 --> 01:50:48.359
using these schemes and abilities that they had.

01:50:48.359 --> 01:50:52.359
I was able to use a fishing net that I owned

01:50:52.359 --> 01:50:55.359
by going down to the sea, to the river,

01:50:55.359 --> 01:50:57.359
put the net out in the evening.

01:50:57.359 --> 01:51:00.359
Early in the morning, I would go down and be able to find fish

01:51:00.359 --> 01:51:02.359
and crabs on the net.

01:51:02.359 --> 01:51:03.359
It was not easy.

01:51:03.359 --> 01:51:06.359
I did not always get a good catch,

01:51:06.359 --> 01:51:09.359
but by doing this,

01:51:09.359 --> 01:51:14.359
eventually I was able to support my family during that time.

01:51:14.359 --> 01:51:17.359
We had to cook outside on a fire.

01:51:17.359 --> 01:51:21.359
I thought about how I could help my family to stay positive,

01:51:21.359 --> 01:51:23.359
we would sit together,

01:51:23.359 --> 01:51:29.930
and we would sink in the songs, play games together,

01:51:29.930 --> 01:51:33.930
and I feel that Jehovah blessed the efforts that I made.

01:51:33.930 --> 01:51:38.390
He brews 13 verse 5,

01:51:38.390 --> 01:51:41.390
that scripture reassured me that,

01:51:41.390 --> 01:51:44.390
as long as I didn't compromise the important aspects

01:51:44.390 --> 01:51:46.390
of Jehovah's worship,

01:51:46.390 --> 01:51:48.390
my family's needs were cared for.

01:51:48.390 --> 01:51:54.539
I have always admired the beauty and power of the sea.

01:51:55.539 --> 01:51:58.539
It reminds me that the one who created the sea,

01:51:58.539 --> 01:52:00.539
it's not hard for him to care for,

01:52:00.539 --> 01:52:03.539
just one small human like me.

01:52:03.539 --> 01:52:15.500
Nice application of the council

01:52:15.500 --> 01:52:18.500
to have practical wisdom and the benefits.

01:52:18.500 --> 01:52:22.500
Now, I encourage you to keep in mind

01:52:22.500 --> 01:52:23.500
what we've discussed here,

01:52:23.500 --> 01:52:26.500
showing the neighbor love that Jesus showed

01:52:26.500 --> 01:52:29.500
and the joy he experienced from that,

01:52:29.500 --> 01:52:34.500
and then the practical wisdom that Jesus taught us about,

01:52:34.500 --> 01:52:37.500
so that we stay close to Jehovah

01:52:37.500 --> 01:52:39.500
and not get distracted with things

01:52:39.500 --> 01:52:42.500
that the world's absorbed with.

01:52:42.500 --> 01:52:46.500
Now, to help us completely capture

01:52:46.500 --> 01:52:50.500
this mental inclination of Jesus,

01:52:50.500 --> 01:52:52.500
especially in the days ahead,

01:52:52.500 --> 01:52:54.500
I want you to find Romans,

01:52:54.500 --> 01:53:01.270
or excuse me, Hebrews chapter 12,

01:53:01.270 --> 01:53:04.270
and many know this verse.

01:53:04.270 --> 01:53:05.270
They've benefited,

01:53:05.270 --> 01:53:08.270
but it certainly applies to our discussion

01:53:08.270 --> 01:53:12.270
about a close friendship with Jehovah

01:53:12.270 --> 01:53:15.270
bringing great joy.

01:53:15.270 --> 01:53:17.270
Hebrews chapter 12,

01:53:17.270 --> 01:53:20.270
and you'll notice here,

01:53:20.270 --> 01:53:22.270
verse 2,

01:53:22.270 --> 01:53:25.270
as we look intently at the chief agent

01:53:25.270 --> 01:53:28.270
and perfector of our faith, Jesus,

01:53:28.270 --> 01:53:31.270
for the joy that was said before him,

01:53:31.270 --> 01:53:34.270
he endured a torture stake,

01:53:34.270 --> 01:53:36.270
despising shame,

01:53:36.270 --> 01:53:39.270
and has sat down at the right hand

01:53:39.270 --> 01:53:41.270
of the throne of God.

01:53:41.270 --> 01:53:44.579
Beautiful council,

01:53:44.579 --> 01:53:48.579
and this is what we need to do.

01:53:48.579 --> 01:53:53.579
See, look intently at the chief agent, Christ Jesus.

01:53:53.579 --> 01:53:56.579
Now, when you're looking at something intently,

01:53:56.579 --> 01:53:59.579
that means you're looking away from everything else.

01:53:59.579 --> 01:54:01.579
You're focused.

01:54:01.579 --> 01:54:05.579
Look intently at these last days

01:54:05.579 --> 01:54:08.579
at the chief agent, Jesus.

01:54:08.579 --> 01:54:10.579
Now, what we learned,

01:54:10.579 --> 01:54:13.579
because you think about what he went through,

01:54:13.579 --> 01:54:16.579
the torture stake is mentioned here,

01:54:16.579 --> 01:54:18.579
even that three and a half year ministry

01:54:18.579 --> 01:54:20.579
with those hypocrites,

01:54:20.579 --> 01:54:22.579
those religious hypocrites attacking him

01:54:22.579 --> 01:54:25.579
with their lies and slander,

01:54:26.579 --> 01:54:28.579
and then those final days

01:54:28.579 --> 01:54:29.579
of his earthly life,

01:54:29.579 --> 01:54:31.579
and especially those final hours,

01:54:31.579 --> 01:54:35.579
and then those hours on the torture stake,

01:54:35.579 --> 01:54:37.579
and he knew what was coming,

01:54:37.579 --> 01:54:40.579
the details.

01:54:40.579 --> 01:54:44.579
How does a man deal with that

01:54:44.579 --> 01:54:48.579
without collapsing?

01:54:48.579 --> 01:54:52.579
Well, we're not left to wonder

01:54:52.579 --> 01:54:55.579
for the joy that was said before him,

01:54:55.579 --> 01:54:57.579
hindered all that.

01:54:57.579 --> 01:55:00.579
So Jesus had the prehuman existence,

01:55:00.579 --> 01:55:03.579
the joy of sitting with his father again

01:55:03.579 --> 01:55:06.579
in the heavens, oh, my,

01:55:06.579 --> 01:55:09.579
it got him through it.

01:55:09.579 --> 01:55:11.579
Same for us brothers,

01:55:11.579 --> 01:55:16.149
the joy will get us through it.

01:55:16.149 --> 01:55:19.149
The joy of staying close with our God,

01:55:19.149 --> 01:55:22.149
and finally this last verse

01:55:22.149 --> 01:55:25.149
for this closing talk here,

01:55:25.149 --> 01:55:29.880
Romans chapter 12.

01:55:29.880 --> 01:55:36.189
Two sentences from this 12th verse here,

01:55:36.189 --> 01:55:38.189
Romans 12, 12,

01:55:38.189 --> 01:55:41.189
and take this to heart.

01:55:41.189 --> 01:55:44.189
Rejoice in the hope,

01:55:44.189 --> 01:55:48.189
endure under tribulation.

01:55:48.189 --> 01:55:51.189
So while waiting for the fulfillment

01:55:51.189 --> 01:55:53.189
of all of Jehovah's promises,

01:55:53.189 --> 01:55:55.189
and the things that we have to deal with,

01:55:55.189 --> 01:55:57.189
remember how Jesus dealt with it,

01:55:57.189 --> 01:56:00.189
just cling to Jehovah,

01:56:00.189 --> 01:56:03.189
have that close relationship with him,

01:56:03.189 --> 01:56:08.189
and you will experience the greatest joy.

01:56:08.189 --> 01:56:11.819
Thank you, Brother Morris,

01:56:11.819 --> 01:56:13.819
for explaining why we find joy

01:56:13.819 --> 01:56:16.819
in walking closely with our Heavenly Father

01:56:16.819 --> 01:56:19.819
as Jesus did.

01:56:19.819 --> 01:56:20.819
We have seen today that our joy

01:56:20.819 --> 01:56:23.819
does not depend on external circumstances.

01:56:23.819 --> 01:56:26.819
Rather, it is a God-given quality,

01:56:26.819 --> 01:56:28.819
and Jehovah has indeed given us

01:56:28.819 --> 01:56:31.819
many reasons to rejoice.

01:56:31.819 --> 01:56:33.819
What can we look forward to

01:56:33.819 --> 01:56:35.819
on the next segment of the program?

01:56:35.819 --> 01:56:38.819
Note that the scripture theme will be

01:56:38.819 --> 01:56:40.819
boast about his holy name,

01:56:40.819 --> 01:56:44.819
let the hearts of those seeking Jehovah rejoice.

01:56:44.819 --> 01:56:46.819
We boast about Jehovah's name

01:56:46.819 --> 01:56:48.819
when we share in the ministry,

01:56:48.819 --> 01:56:51.819
no matter what form that might take.

01:56:51.819 --> 01:56:53.819
Throughout the next session,

01:56:53.819 --> 01:56:56.819
we will focus on the joy of disciple-making,

01:56:56.819 --> 01:56:58.819
and the program will help us

01:56:58.819 --> 01:57:01.819
to become more effective disciple-makers.

01:57:01.819 --> 01:57:06.380
Our closing song is number 28,

01:57:06.380 --> 01:57:09.380
entitled Gaining Jehovah's Friendship.

01:57:09.380 --> 01:57:13.380
After the song, you may have your own closing prayer.
