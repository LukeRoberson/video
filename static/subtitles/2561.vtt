00:00:01.649 --> 00:00:07.969
Over the last several years, the U.S. branch and World Headquarters has had the responsibility

00:00:07.969 --> 00:00:11.410
of constructing several new buildings.

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:16.449
Nine of these buildings were awarded a four green globes rating, which is the highest

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:19.570
green globe certification possible.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.609
The two at Wacill were the office building and F-residence.

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:30.570
The seven at the New War Complex were the four residence buildings, the maintenance

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.969
building, office and services building, and vehicle maintenance building.

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:42.770
Now a good number of you may be asking right about now, what exactly is this green globes

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:43.770
program?

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:51.369
Well, it is a program which assesses the eco-friendliness of a building starting from design through

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:53.130
construction.

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:59.250
An independent third party assesses the environmental impact of a completed building on a scale

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.890
of one to four globes.

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:09.129
The organization that coordinates the program stated that a four green globes rating that

00:01:09.129 --> 00:01:16.329
demonstrates national leadership and excellence in the practice of water, energy and environmental

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:20.370
efficiency to reduce environmental impact.

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:26.569
The organization that coordinates the green globes program drew our attention to how significant

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:34.609
and accomplishment receiving this award is by mentioning that only 4% of properties

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:41.650
that apply are able to achieve the top rating for even one of their buildings.

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:49.730
In spite of this, on September 14, 2016, the Warwick project was simultaneously awarded

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:57.769
seven of these four green globes for all buildings that qualified for consideration.

00:01:57.769 --> 00:02:03.769
Now understanding the significance of this award, you probably feel a measure of pride

00:02:03.769 --> 00:02:07.250
and satisfaction with this milestone.

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:12.930
Another question you may have is, how does this environmental design at Warwick and

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.169
Wachill benefit the organization?

00:02:16.169 --> 00:02:22.689
Well since Revelation chapter 11 verse 18 points out that it is Jehovah that will ultimately

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:29.409
need to step in to save our Earth from ruin, the intent is not to join some sustainable

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:34.050
design fad or try to do what only Jehovah can do.

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:41.330
This means that we don't design simply to be green as many in the world would, rather

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:47.330
we saw four noteworthy benefits from this level of design.

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:52.409
First and foremost, Jehovah's name is glorified.

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:58.370
It often happens that during the design phase of a project, claims are made as to the

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:06.210
anticipated environmental impact of a building design, however the final outcome after construction

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:12.849
often falls short of what is promise, which can leave officials quite frustrated.

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:18.849
With Warwick, we modestly made known our goal to the local officials and community that

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:24.289
we would strive to achieve three of four green globes.

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:31.530
In contrast, this award confirms that Jehovah's Witnesses have kept our word by achieving

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.289
not three but four green globes.

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:42.490
Having our word has brought honor to Jehovah and built a trustworthy reputation in the community.

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:46.449
And that leads to our second benefit.

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:55.330
This top environmental rating confirms that we as an organization respect Jehovah's creation.

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:01.610
Being known as responsible stewards of the environment allows us to have many benefits,

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:04.849
one of which is in the case of Warkill.

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:11.610
Our reputation made it easier to gain approvals to expand our facilities there.

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:16.769
A third benefit is to our neighbors in the surrounding community.

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:22.730
For example, the drinking water in the adjoining lake is not contaminated.

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:27.170
Our site lighting doesn't light the night sky.

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:32.449
The use of native plants serves to protect the health of the beautiful surrounding

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:35.449
forest that we all enjoy.

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:41.170
And the design and location of the buildings on site preserve the spectacular views from

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:44.610
the adjoining forest trails.

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:52.610
Yet a fourth benefit to the organization is that this level of design makes the best use

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.129
of donated funds.

00:04:55.129 --> 00:05:01.889
While experts vary on the exact percentages over the lifetime of a typical building, operational

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:08.329
and maintenance costs can be four to six times the initial construction costs.

00:05:08.329 --> 00:05:13.810
So the more efficient the design and construction, the more long-term savings are realized for

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:15.610
the organization.

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:21.569
For instance, an independent energy consultant recently calculated that we could expect

00:05:21.569 --> 00:05:28.089
to see savings of over one million dollars annually from the energy efficiency measures

00:05:28.089 --> 00:05:35.170
incorporated into our project as compared to a standard construction of similar facilities.

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:42.689
But you may be curious as to what energy and environmental features were incorporated

00:05:42.689 --> 00:05:48.689
into the Warwick project to earn these awards and save funds.

00:05:48.689 --> 00:05:52.930
These features covered multiple aspects of design.

00:05:52.930 --> 00:06:00.769
They basically fall into five categories â€“ landscaping, rainwater control, lighting

00:06:00.769 --> 00:06:06.569
control, energy efficiency, and water usage.

00:06:06.569 --> 00:06:13.250
With respect to the first category, landscaping, a control system checks rainfall and local

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:19.810
weather conditions to determine how much water is needed in each irrigation zone.

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:25.889
And drought-resistant native plants and trees also reduce water needs.

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:30.970
The second category is rainwater control.

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:39.660
All rainwater from the roof and building surfaces is treated with green roofs, buyer retention

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:54.870
areas, permeable concrete paving, underground sand filters, and stormwater planters.

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:59.470
And a third category is lighting control.

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:05.750
Lighting sensors and perimeter window spaces are linked to a control system that balance

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:10.589
natural lighting with fluorescent lighting while still permitting the occupant control

00:07:10.589 --> 00:07:13.230
as desired.

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:17.430
The fourth category is energy efficiency.

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:25.649
High efficiency HVAC equipment, boilers, and chillers were incorporated.

00:07:25.649 --> 00:07:32.449
A geothermal well feel, consisting of some 120 wells, takes advantage of renewable

00:07:32.449 --> 00:07:37.810
energy to supplement building heating and cooling needs.

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:45.649
And with respect to our fifth category, water usage, water is conserved in all the buildings

00:07:45.649 --> 00:07:51.290
by means of plumbing fixtures that use lower volumes of water.

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:58.250
As we stated earlier, the operation and maintenance expense is the greatest part of a building's

00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:00.529
total cost.

00:08:00.529 --> 00:08:06.250
To the extent that we practice water, lighting, and energy conservation in our individual

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:13.889
rooms and workplaces, to that extent we can have a personal share in realizing the full

00:08:13.889 --> 00:08:20.970
benefit, potential, and purpose of these new facilities at Wacul and Worry.

00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:27.370
And what knit together all of these features, making the awards possible though, were the

00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:29.209
people.

00:08:29.209 --> 00:08:35.769
This was only because of the close cooperation and tireless efforts of the thousands who

00:08:35.769 --> 00:08:41.570
worked in various areas such as design, purchasing, and construction.

00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:47.649
It truly was a strong testimony to the power of unity.

00:08:47.649 --> 00:08:54.649
Certainly, Jehovah's heart is filled with joy, as he sees all the fine work that has

00:08:54.649 --> 00:09:00.929
been accomplished and the glory that it's brought, and will continue to bring to his name.
