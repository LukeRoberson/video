00:00:06.219 --> 00:00:11.259
We've come to our principal talk for this

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:17.260
141st class of Gillian, the graduation.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:22.500
And we're going to invite Brother Garrett and Lush now.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.500
I thought you'd find this interesting.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.539
This is the 141st class.

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:32.140
We've heard that throughout the morning.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:45.149
Well, 100 classes ago, Brother Lush was graduating from the 41st class.

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.950
And I don't know if heaven did it, but we had an Austrian in each one of those.

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.829
So that's very nice.

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:59.229
I don't want to say anything that he is getting a little older, but he still looks great, doesn't he?

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:05.549
Because he knew the sister in this class, when she was just a tiny little girl.

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:13.040
So very nice, and with a Lush gave me that information, so it's bona fide.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:20.879
So Brother Lush, as you want to speak on the theme, make good use of your time.

00:01:20.879 --> 00:01:22.879
What's the time?

00:01:22.879 --> 00:01:26.079
Well, anyway, it's time to start.

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:33.439
There are certain things of which the richest and the poorest person on earth have the same.

00:01:33.519 --> 00:01:35.519
Number one, life.

00:01:35.519 --> 00:01:38.000
Second, two parents.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.480
Third, a free will.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:44.579
And fourth, time.

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.819
Poor and rich have all 24 hours a day.

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:54.180
Therefore, it's not quite correct to say one has no time or plenty of time.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.780
All have the same, 24 hours.

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.739
The word time is an integral part of our vocabulary.

00:02:02.739 --> 00:02:04.659
What is time?

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:07.540
Some say time is money.

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:13.300
If we make decisions, time will tell whether they are good ones.

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:21.300
In the world, some make wrong decisions, and then therefore they have to do time in prison.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.060
When driving a car, we may make good time.

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.620
Although from time to time, we may stop and have a snack.

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:34.659
We are taking our time, if we do not hurry.

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:42.099
We may still arrive on time, or even ahead of time, if we time it right.

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:47.939
But at times, we may still be late, especially if our timing was poor,

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:54.080
which may not be all the time, just from time to time.

00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:02.539
After we arrive at our destination, the time has arrived to have a good time.

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:08.379
But in a more serious note, how does the Bible use the term time?

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:11.099
Ecclesiastes chapter 3 verse 1 says,

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:17.819
There is an appointed time for everything, a time for every activity under the heavens.

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:27.020
For birth and for death, to plant, to abroot, to tear down, to build up,

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:34.060
to weep, and to laugh, to wail, and to dance, a time to keep,

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:40.780
and a time to throw away, like when we have to move to another complex.

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.300
It is now the acceptable time to preach,

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:51.900
because the appointed times of the nations are over, and we are living in the time of the end.

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:57.659
Therefore, we should be zealous in line with the urgency of times.

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:04.060
Jehovah blesses the work, and said that he will speed it up at its own time.

00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:10.939
The Greek adjective Ayonios can, as is evident from the context,

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:15.259
to signify both long-lasting and everlasting.

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.899
From the first man Adam forward, time has been measured in terms of years.

00:04:21.899 --> 00:04:27.980
Thus, Adam was 130 years old when he became father to Seth.

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:32.540
Monthly divisions also came into use.

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:37.259
By the time of the flood, we find time divided into months of 30 days,

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:45.019
and a period of five months is shown in the Bible to equal 150 days.

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:51.259
The same record also indicates that Noah divided the year into 12 months.

00:04:53.019 --> 00:04:59.740
To track time, a calendar is used for dividing time into years, months, weeks, and days.

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:08.620
The world's oldest calendar was discovered in a Scottish field at Warren Field,

00:05:09.339 --> 00:05:17.740
according to BBC News from the end 2013, a National Geographic of July 15, 2013.

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:23.579
It was excavated first in the year 2004 only.

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:29.259
To track time during the day, also sundials were invented.

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:33.740
They are considered the first time measuring devices known to men.

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:40.779
Dating to the 19th dynasty or the 13th century before a common era,

00:05:41.819 --> 00:05:46.860
a few years ago a sundial was found on the floor of a workman's hut

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:53.180
in the valley of kings, the burial place of rulers from Egypt.

00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:04.860
In 1675, King Charles II of England commissioned that a small observatory be constructed

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:12.300
in what is now the London Borough of Greenwich in order to defining out of the longitude of places

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:20.860
for perfecting navigation and astronomy. Two newly invented timepieces with pendulums,

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:28.379
13 feet or four meters long were installed to make accurate calculations of the Earth's rotation.

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:38.139
Noon Greenwich mean time is the moment when the sun reaches its zenith over any point

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:45.980
on the Greenwich longitude line or meridian from Latin Meridianus of mid-day.

00:06:46.699 --> 00:06:52.459
Based on this Latin word, time before Noon came to be known as ante meridian or

00:06:53.420 --> 00:07:03.579
before mid-day and time after Noon came to be known as post meridian or pm as we call it.

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:13.100
Today time is measured for accuracy with atomic clocks. They are regulated by atomic vibrations

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:23.220
and are accurate to one second in 80 million years. Very accurate. Again, what is time?

00:07:24.339 --> 00:07:35.699
You have heard the saying as time goes by or time flies. But this is scripturally not quite correct.

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:48.019
Time does not go or walk or fly. We fly. And this is supported in Psalm 90, verse 10,

00:07:49.459 --> 00:08:00.339
where Moses wrote this Psalm, not David, and it says in verse 10, the span of our life is 70 years

00:08:00.899 --> 00:08:08.420
or 80 if one is especially strong, but they are filled with trouble and sorrow. They quickly pass by

00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:19.569
and away we fly, not the time. When a man dies, time is still there and hasn't flown anywhere.

00:08:21.649 --> 00:08:31.329
Again, what is time? 12 o'clock Noon in New York is 12 o'clock midnight in Mongolia.

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:39.570
When you cross the date line westbound, suddenly you have lost the day seemingly, but did you really lose a day?

00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:48.299
No, it's just a perception. To the contrary, when you come from Japan to the United States, you

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:57.419
seem to gain a day crossing the date line eastbound. But does this change the reality of time? No.

00:08:58.379 --> 00:09:08.059
You have not become a day younger. Sorry. What's the time on North Pole, exactly on North Pole?

00:09:08.059 --> 00:09:15.340
If you stay on the North Pole, does time move on? Something to think about.

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:22.779
Now really, time is an abstract concept that humans have invented to explain, compare, and measure

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:31.580
what we observe. Sometimes time seems to move faster than at other times. There's an old saying

00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:38.700
that the watched kettle never boils. It's true that when we are watching time, when we are conscious

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:45.100
of it, when we are waiting for something to happen, then it seems to pass ever so slowly.

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:51.500
However, if we are busy, if we are interested in and preoccupied with what we are doing,

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:58.379
then it really appears that time flies. Moreover, with older people, time seems to pass

00:09:58.379 --> 00:10:06.700
much more quickly than with young children. And why is this? One year added to the life of a one

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:14.059
year old means a hundred percent increase. One year added to the life of a 50 year old means just

00:10:14.059 --> 00:10:23.179
two percent more. The perception of time is also subject to circumstances. When a couple in love

00:10:23.179 --> 00:10:31.419
meets, they wish time would stand still. Is it not so? But they cannot slow down what is perceived

00:10:31.419 --> 00:10:37.740
this time. On the other hand, when somebody is sick in a hospital bed, he might wish that time

00:10:38.539 --> 00:10:45.980
more quicker, quicker so he could recover sooner and go home sooner. But he cannot speed up

00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:54.299
the passing of time. Time is an observed phenomenon by means of which we humans sense and record

00:10:54.299 --> 00:11:01.820
changes in our environment and in the universe. In the universe, time is measured based on the speed

00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:09.500
of light, which is a constant. The Michelson-Molly experiment around the end of the 19th century

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:15.740
discovered that the speed of light is the same regardless of the direction it's heading

00:11:16.539 --> 00:11:28.740
and regardless of the motion of the originating source. Life moves at about 300,000 kilometers per

00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:38.500
second. It takes about 100,000 years for a beam of light to travel from just one end of our Milky Way

00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:46.659
to the other end. And our Milky Way is said to have 200 billion stars like the Sun.

00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:57.620
What you see when you look up at night to the night sky, it's not what is there now,

00:11:57.620 --> 00:12:04.340
but what was there in the past. When a light beam from a star that is a million light years away

00:12:05.139 --> 00:12:12.100
hits the Earth, it means that the object that you now see was there a million years ago.

00:12:13.779 --> 00:12:20.659
To see what is there now and whether the star even still exists, you need to wait another

00:12:21.299 --> 00:12:28.179
until the light beam from that place arrives at the Earth. Just imagine. Looking at the universe,

00:12:28.179 --> 00:12:37.139
we always look only into the past. It is estimated that the visible universe exists in 13

00:12:37.139 --> 00:12:42.899
billion years. Most scientists agree that it had a beginning, so-called Big Bang.

00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:49.379
The Bible says in the beginning God created and that includes the visible universe.

00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:57.700
The universe expands in all directions. Scientists have not found an end of the visible universe

00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:05.220
with optical telescopes or radio telescopes, but if one would continue to travel through space long

00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:13.460
enough logically one should come to an area where there are no more stars or galaxies just empty

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:21.139
space. Some known galaxies are moving into that empty space or toward that empty space with

00:13:21.139 --> 00:13:28.879
about the speed of light. It's very impressive. Some scientists say time does not exist.

00:13:30.399 --> 00:13:37.279
It exists however definitely in our perception. Man invented the concept of time to be able to

00:13:37.279 --> 00:13:51.120
measure changes. Deep time always exists. Well in Jude verse 25 we can read what it says there

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:59.919
from our own Bible. It says to the only God in Savior through Jesus Christ our Lord,

00:13:59.919 --> 00:14:09.519
big glory, majesty, might and authority for all past eternity and now and into all eternity.

00:14:12.639 --> 00:14:20.799
Well we know Jehovah had no beginning. We have a hard time grasping that. When Jehovah was alone

00:14:20.799 --> 00:14:26.399
before he created the logos there was no change because Jehovah does not change.

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:35.440
This helps us to understand in what way Jehovah always existed. Jehovah is not subject to time. He

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:43.200
exists independently and outside from what we perceive as time. Where the new world translation

00:14:43.919 --> 00:14:54.960
translates past eternity in Jude 25 the Greek original text says before all time. Surprise,

00:14:54.960 --> 00:15:03.679
surprise, before time. The conclusion is that time had a beginning. Is this a new understanding?

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:11.279
No. If you want to put down a reference watch tower 1982 September 1.

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:21.039
September 1 page 22 in paragraph 17 it says about this verse in Jude 25. Jude appropriately

00:15:21.039 --> 00:15:27.759
ascribed to glory, majesty, might and authority to Jehovah for all past eternity or

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:41.779
to quote the watch tower before all time as men might know it. We seem safe to say the time as we know

00:15:41.779 --> 00:15:49.539
it as humans came into being when Jehovah started to create first the logos. But what we perceive

00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:58.899
as time now will continue forever and ever in the future. In 1 Corinthians chapter 7, 29 it says more

00:15:58.899 --> 00:16:07.460
over this I say, brothers, the time left is reduced. Christ had given His disciples the sign of His

00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:12.259
presence and had warned them. Keep on the watch therefore because you do not know on what they

00:16:12.259 --> 00:16:22.980
argue, the Lord is coming. Matthew 24, verse 3 and 42. The time left was reduced in the sense that

00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:30.179
those first Christians and century Christians had to live constantly in expectation of Christ's

00:16:30.179 --> 00:16:36.580
coming. Furthermore, they did not know how much time remained for them individually before

00:16:36.659 --> 00:16:44.340
time and unforeseen occurrence brought their life to a close. As an important event near,

00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:52.019
there is an increased sense of urgency. How can we illustrate that? Well, suppose there is a

00:16:52.019 --> 00:16:58.419
waiting. The days before are very busy in order to prepare well for the event. Even on the waiting

00:16:58.419 --> 00:17:04.339
day the bride will be urgently preparing herself so the waiting part it does not have to wait,

00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:14.099
which would be very impolite. If you have to catch a flight you are perhaps urgently nervously

00:17:14.099 --> 00:17:20.579
preparing your luggage making sure that you are at the airport on time because you do not want to

00:17:20.579 --> 00:17:28.339
miss the flight. Suppose a farmer has a mature crop ready to be harvested. Suddenly there is a

00:17:28.339 --> 00:17:38.180
storm warning. Dark clouds loom at the horizon. The storm could destroy the crop. Don't you think

00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:45.460
that he will urgently organize his whole household to go out to the field and begin to bring in the

00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:52.819
crop before the storm hits? Christians are involved in a harvesting work. John 435,

00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:59.859
quote Jesus saying, view the fields that they are ripe for harvesting. The harvest time will soon be

00:17:59.859 --> 00:18:09.140
over. So are we making good use of our time to help bring in the harvest? The harvest is great,

00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:18.019
but the workers are few, said Jesus, Matthew 935. And that shows the urgency. The hurricane of the

00:18:18.019 --> 00:18:25.859
great tribulation is close. It's a hurricane in the illustration so we need to hurry.

00:18:27.299 --> 00:18:34.579
When a woman is close to giving birth and the birth pangs started, the water broke, let's say,

00:18:34.579 --> 00:18:39.220
then it is urgent to rush her to the hospital or call a midwife to come to the home.

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:46.339
Jesus death was a much more important event than awaiting a birth or a slight or a crop.

00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:53.779
As the appointed time for Jesus' sacrificial death drew near his sense of urgency increased.

00:18:55.380 --> 00:19:01.940
Jesus stepped up his activity and his preaching as the time for him to be on earth ran out.

00:19:03.299 --> 00:19:11.140
True Christians have always lived with a sense of urgency. In the first century, Christians in

00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:17.940
Judea and Jerusalem needed to keep on the watch and that was imperative because Jesus warned

00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:25.059
that the Roman armies would come and would attack the city. And he said, let those in Judea begin

00:19:25.059 --> 00:19:31.220
fleeing to the mountains. It was urgent. Now more than ever, the time that remains before Jehovah

00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:38.980
destroys false religion through political elements is reduced. It is vital then that we make

00:19:39.539 --> 00:19:48.180
wise use of our time that the time that remains. How? As the Apostle Paul explains in Ephesians 5, 16,

00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:55.700
we must buy out the opportune time for the more important things at the expense of what is

00:19:55.700 --> 00:20:03.460
non-essential. We need to make every day count. Do we live as though the end could come at any time

00:20:03.779 --> 00:20:10.579
or do we live as though it is far off? Jesus warned, the Son of Man is coming at an hour that you do

00:20:10.579 --> 00:20:20.660
not think to be it. Matthew 24, 44. Our pattern of life reflects how much we trust in Jehovah

00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:26.259
by putting faith in his prophetic word, keeping the urgency of the times in mind.

00:20:27.059 --> 00:20:36.099
A void, a complacent attitude like the people of Sodom and Gomorrah had. They were eating,

00:20:36.099 --> 00:20:42.180
drinking, buying, selling, planting, building said Jesus. But on the day that a lot came out of

00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:51.059
Sodom, it rained fire and sulfur from heaven and destroyed them all. Luke 17, 28, 19. It was urgent

00:20:51.059 --> 00:20:56.900
for a lot in his family to flee and it is urgent for us too. We need to be prepared.

00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:06.259
We can prepare, for instance, if we live in an earthquake zone by having our houses built,

00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:14.339
earthquake proof. It costs more effort, more time involved, preparing the house, but when an

00:21:14.339 --> 00:21:23.470
earthquake hits, then we are better prepared to survive. Revelation refers to the four angels who

00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:29.869
have prepared the hour or have been prepared for the hour and day and month and year,

00:21:30.910 --> 00:21:38.509
units of time that we can understand, Revelation 9, 14, 15. Seeing how prophecies were fulfilled at

00:21:38.509 --> 00:21:46.430
specific times should inspire faith in the God of times and seasons and in his word.

00:21:47.069 --> 00:21:56.269
So the angels will let loose the four wins of destruction. Are you ready? Jehovah is a perfect time

00:21:56.269 --> 00:22:03.230
keeper. Do we make good use of what we perceive as time by attending meetings, reading the Bible

00:22:03.309 --> 00:22:12.190
daily, even after giving it graduation and going out and field ministry? Whereas it is appropriate

00:22:12.190 --> 00:22:20.829
to take time for leisure and other activities, it is good not to waste time but keep the balance.

00:22:21.950 --> 00:22:28.509
If we use time wisely, buying it out by giving priority to spiritual things and sacrifice

00:22:28.589 --> 00:22:35.150
less important time as a payment, so to say, then we will see the promise fulfilled to live forever

00:22:35.150 --> 00:22:43.710
and ever and ever. No more need then to worry about time, but now is the time to conclude my talk,

00:22:43.710 --> 00:23:15.759
so I would not go over time. Thank you very much. Well, although we thoroughly enjoyed that and we

00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:25.440
appreciate your hard work and meditation, now we will share some greetings from various branches,

00:23:27.599 --> 00:23:34.960
highlight some of the things that they wanted to pass on. Angola, with their faith strengthened by

00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:40.240
means of a thorough study of God's word and refined spiritual qualities, the graduates will give

00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:47.519
a fine, contribution to further stabilize and strengthen Jehovah's organization. Then Argentina,

00:23:48.559 --> 00:23:53.680
although the school of Gilead will soon become a memory, they didn't know about Brother Hurdstock,

00:23:54.480 --> 00:24:00.880
you will treasure it for the rest of your lives. Armenia, we rejoice with you graduates on this

00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:07.119
special day. We're delighted to see how Jehovah's training more brothers and sisters to take on

00:24:07.119 --> 00:24:13.839
additional responsibility. And Benin, you'll find this one quite interesting, this part of it

00:24:13.839 --> 00:24:21.759
passed on to all of you and this is to the students or graduates, please hurry up. We are waiting

00:24:21.759 --> 00:24:29.759
for you out here in the worldwide field. So Bolivia, our hearts rejoice along with you dear Gilead

00:24:29.759 --> 00:24:35.279
graduates on this day that brings so much praise to our Heavenly Father. And then Britain,

00:24:35.279 --> 00:24:40.400
what a wonderful blessing and unique privilege it is for each student to have his or her faith

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:46.640
strengthened through an intensive study of God's word. Barundi, five months of Bible training that

00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:52.640
you've received will give added impetus to the all-important work of helping all who are rightly

00:24:52.640 --> 00:25:01.279
disposed for everlasting life. And then the Congo-Konsasha, we rejoice with those who rejoice, this is indeed

00:25:01.279 --> 00:25:07.680
a special day for all the graduates. Georgia, the country, congratulations on successfully

00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:14.240
completing the spiritually enriching course of study. Germany, please accept warm love and greetings

00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:21.519
from Salter's Bethel in Germany. Jehovah, as our grand instructor, continues to educate his

00:25:21.519 --> 00:25:28.160
servants in a wonderful way. Haiti, this graduation is another proof that Jehovah does treat his loyal

00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:34.880
servants in a special way. And then France, we wish to send you the very warm love from the

00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:40.559
France-Bethel family as you're about to receive your diplomas along with your service assignments.

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:46.640
In Japan, since their warm Christian love and greetings, all graduates must have experienced

00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:53.920
firsthand Jehovah's loving care. Kenya, as you now take the benefit of this training with you to

00:25:53.920 --> 00:26:00.319
your assignments, we're confident that Jehovah will be with you wherever you go. In the Netherlands,

00:26:00.319 --> 00:26:06.160
please accept our warm love and greetings and made Jehovah continue to bless you in your assignment,

00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:12.160
whether a new one or one you're familiar with. Nigeria sends their warmest greetings to all.

00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:18.160
Paraguay passes on their wish to have Jehovah bless all your efforts in training,

00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:25.039
Solomon Islands, known as the Happy Isles, wishes to send their warmest Christian love and greetings.

00:26:25.759 --> 00:26:32.960
Suriname, this is quite interesting. They share this point. In 1959, two brothers from Suriname

00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:39.200
attended the 32nd class of Gillian. Since then, many in Suriname nurtured the dream of going to

00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:46.960
Gillian. Now, 57 years later, we rejoice with the privilege of having one more student attending a class.

00:26:48.319 --> 00:26:55.359
And then Thailand, from the land of smiles, we add our happy smiles to yours and send our warm

00:26:55.359 --> 00:27:01.599
love and greetings to all on this special day. And finally, Ukraine, during the past five months,

00:27:01.599 --> 00:27:08.000
the great potter, Jehovah God, was intensely molding you so that you can now say, we are all the

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:15.839
clay and you are our potter. We are all the work of your hand. So we appreciate those sincere

00:27:15.839 --> 00:27:26.240
greetings from our brothers throughout the earth. Now, before we share the diplomas with you,

00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:32.400
I want to just pass on these statistics the brothers like to receive these for this particular

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:41.279
141st class. Number of single brothers, 12. Number of single sisters, 4. Number of married couples,

00:27:41.279 --> 00:27:48.559
16. Total number of students, 48. Their average age, 40.8.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:57.279
Average years in the truth, 25.1. Average years in full-time ministry, 19.0.

00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:08.509
So for those that love statistics, you now have them. Now, we're going to have the

00:28:08.509 --> 00:28:15.549
presentation of the diplomas to the 141st class of Gillian, brother David Schaeffer is going

00:28:15.549 --> 00:28:23.789
to help me as a helper to the teaching committee and be helping as we pass on the diplomas to these

00:28:23.789 --> 00:29:00.079
graduates of the 141st class of Gillian. So let's take a look at them. First, we have brother and

And brother and sister Yiga will be returning to Uganda.

At this point, as we customarily do,

00:33:48.529 --> 00:33:50.970
we're going to have the class resolution letter

00:33:50.970 --> 00:34:02.240
read, and Brother Richard Cook will do there for the class.

00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:07.640
To the governing body and the Bethel family, dear brothers,

00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:10.519
from the moment we received our invitations to Gilea

00:34:10.519 --> 00:34:13.679
down to this day of graduation, we

00:34:13.679 --> 00:34:18.199
feel we have received a gift of undeserved kindness

00:34:18.199 --> 00:34:21.280
from Jehovah and his organization.

00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:25.599
There is nothing that we have done or could ever do

00:34:25.599 --> 00:34:30.679
to deserve the instruction, training, molding,

00:34:30.679 --> 00:34:33.239
and loving attention that we have received

00:34:33.239 --> 00:34:36.119
over the past five months.

00:34:36.119 --> 00:34:40.639
Just as Isaiah chapter 26 verse 12 says,

00:34:40.639 --> 00:34:44.920
O Jehovah, everything we have done,

00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:49.199
you have accomplished for us.

00:34:49.199 --> 00:34:53.480
Jehovah has given us the privilege of experiencing

00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:56.880
close association with you, dear brothers,

00:34:56.880 --> 00:34:59.400
of the governing body.

00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:04.119
Your humility, your love for the brotherhood,

00:35:04.119 --> 00:35:06.639
and your absolute determination to follow

00:35:06.639 --> 00:35:11.760
Jehovah's direction have deeply impressed us.

00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:16.719
We saw this clearly during your faith strengthening lectures,

00:35:16.719 --> 00:35:18.960
but also in the lighter moments that you shared

00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:21.519
with us outside of the classroom,

00:35:21.519 --> 00:35:25.880
all the while preparing for your move to warwick.

00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:28.360
Seeing your examples firsthand has only

00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:32.639
made us more convinced that this is the organization,

00:35:32.639 --> 00:35:38.349
Jehovah is blessing and directing today.

00:35:38.349 --> 00:35:40.789
What a true joy it has been for us

00:35:40.789 --> 00:35:45.510
to be part of this delightful Bethel family.

00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:49.349
You've been an example in hospitality,

00:35:49.349 --> 00:35:54.269
making us feel at home away from home.

00:35:54.269 --> 00:35:56.989
The excellent work of so many departments

00:35:56.989 --> 00:36:00.469
has created an environment where studying day and night

00:36:00.469 --> 00:36:05.670
and night and day was both possible and enjoyable.

00:36:05.670 --> 00:36:09.110
An essential part of our learning experience

00:36:09.110 --> 00:36:12.630
has been seeing the faith of so many of you

00:36:12.630 --> 00:36:16.309
long-time members of the family.

00:36:16.309 --> 00:36:18.269
We've also learned from the faith of you

00:36:18.269 --> 00:36:23.190
the many commuters and temporary volunteers who willingly

00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:28.820
make yourselves available to serve here at Bethel.

00:36:28.820 --> 00:36:34.099
We are truly grateful to you, our dear instructors,

00:36:34.099 --> 00:36:37.460
for generously giving of your very selves

00:36:37.460 --> 00:36:42.380
both mind and heart in the way that you have taught us.

00:36:42.380 --> 00:36:45.139
During our training, your love for the Bible truth

00:36:45.139 --> 00:36:48.260
that you were teaching touched us deeply,

00:36:48.260 --> 00:36:53.619
your accuracy and yet your warmth, your seriousness

00:36:53.619 --> 00:36:59.940
and yet your humor showed us a balanced worthy of imitation.

00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:03.019
Your obvious determination to hold fast

00:37:03.019 --> 00:37:06.059
to the direction of the faithful and discreet slave

00:37:06.059 --> 00:37:10.059
has made a lasting impression on us.

00:37:10.059 --> 00:37:14.300
As we go to our assignments, we are resolved to do

00:37:14.300 --> 00:37:18.579
as 1 Peter chapter 4 verse 10 states,

00:37:18.579 --> 00:37:23.300
to the extent that each one has received a gift,

00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:26.860
use it in ministering to one another

00:37:26.860 --> 00:37:30.699
as fine stewards of God's undeserved kindness.

00:37:30.699 --> 00:37:34.619
Gilead has been a priceless gift from Jehovah

00:37:34.619 --> 00:37:37.099
through all of you.

00:37:37.099 --> 00:37:40.179
Having been shown such undeserved kindness,

00:37:40.179 --> 00:37:46.219
we desire to use it to demonstrate our love for Jehovah.

00:37:46.219 --> 00:37:49.179
More than ever before, we are determined

00:37:49.179 --> 00:37:52.380
to continue to advance the preaching of the good news

00:37:52.380 --> 00:37:54.940
and to strengthen our brothers.

00:37:54.940 --> 00:38:00.780
It is our earnest prayer that this be our life's work,

00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:05.980
all to the honor and glory of our Heavenly Father, Jehovah.

00:38:05.980 --> 00:38:36.260
Your brothers and sisters of the 141st class of Gilead.

00:38:36.260 --> 00:38:40.820
Before we have a brief moment for some,

00:38:40.820 --> 00:38:45.340
including comments, I have some more statistics.

00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:50.059
But this is a interest to us with the attendance figures.

00:38:50.059 --> 00:38:53.219
Canada, 679.

00:38:53.219 --> 00:38:56.420
The United States, that's 9,814,

00:38:56.420 --> 00:38:58.900
but this is who that includes.

00:38:58.900 --> 00:39:02.059
Patterson 3,519.

00:39:02.059 --> 00:39:04.659
Brooklyn 1,405.

00:39:04.659 --> 00:39:08.139
Fish kill, excuse me, 763.

00:39:08.139 --> 00:39:11.179
Wall kill, 2,540.

00:39:11.179 --> 00:39:14.059
Warwick 1,219.

00:39:14.059 --> 00:39:16.139
Curacao, 61.

00:39:16.139 --> 00:39:19.380
Fort Lauderdale, Florida, 134.

00:39:19.380 --> 00:39:24.260
Jamaica, 37, and Puerto Rico, 136.

00:39:24.260 --> 00:39:29.139
So that makes a grand total of 10,493.

00:39:29.139 --> 00:39:45.500
One of the delay was four, but they all know

00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:48.380
hundreds of thousands are going to see it pretty soon.

00:39:48.380 --> 00:39:52.900
And that's really what wanted to just pass on to you.

00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:56.420
Just a brief review of some of the key thoughts

00:39:56.420 --> 00:39:58.980
and certainly can't touch on all of it.

00:39:59.019 --> 00:40:04.219
But see the cloud, follow the cloud, not men.

00:40:04.219 --> 00:40:05.460
Nice reminder.

00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:09.059
And of course, you'll always remember Brother Hertz talk.

00:40:09.059 --> 00:40:13.579
And a nice thought, smells ring bells.

00:40:13.579 --> 00:40:17.139
Again, the translators will have fun with that.

00:40:17.139 --> 00:40:21.860
And then the warning about ego, good caution, council.

00:40:21.860 --> 00:40:25.900
And nice thoughts about testing Jehovah, then be tested.

00:40:25.940 --> 00:40:29.539
And of course, all the good experiences and interviews

00:40:29.539 --> 00:40:34.619
and for the most reminding us to make good use of our time.

00:40:34.619 --> 00:40:36.139
So it's been a wonderful program.

00:40:36.139 --> 00:40:40.860
What's nice, too, because you get into your assignment

00:40:40.860 --> 00:40:44.219
and because Jehovah's bless us with the broadcasting

00:40:44.219 --> 00:40:48.179
of the program, so that'll be up there in due course.

00:40:48.179 --> 00:40:51.820
And now this has been permeating with excitement

00:40:51.820 --> 00:40:54.420
with your family and close friends.

00:40:54.420 --> 00:40:59.579
And now with Jehovah's blessing on this project,

00:40:59.579 --> 00:41:03.099
you can go and play it months from now.

00:41:03.099 --> 00:41:05.940
You might face some discouraging circumstance.

00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:11.300
Well, go back and you can stop it and think about it.

00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:13.099
But I mean, what a blessing.

00:41:13.099 --> 00:41:15.500
Especially for your graduates to be able to go back

00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:17.980
and then just absorb more.

00:41:17.980 --> 00:41:21.260
So keep that in mind and Jehovah.

00:41:21.260 --> 00:41:28.019
Well, bless you with good reminders in the days ahead.

00:41:28.019 --> 00:41:31.980
So at this point, we're going to invite all of them.

00:41:31.980 --> 00:41:36.539
We're supposed to all be ready to sing this new song.

00:41:36.539 --> 00:41:40.179
And I know my wife and I practiced.

00:41:40.179 --> 00:41:44.739
We hope you practiced, but those that know how to read music,

00:41:44.739 --> 00:41:48.980
please sing out and help those around you.

00:41:48.980 --> 00:41:50.300
It's a beautiful song.

00:41:50.300 --> 00:41:53.019
And I love the lyrics now.

00:41:53.019 --> 00:41:56.780
See, because we've had one of my favorites is song 135.

00:41:56.780 --> 00:41:59.219
And the song book we have at this point.

00:41:59.219 --> 00:42:01.900
But see, this has a message here.

00:42:01.900 --> 00:42:04.139
And you're saying it, and you keep this in mind

00:42:04.139 --> 00:42:07.780
in your assignment, we will.

00:42:07.780 --> 00:42:09.260
That might.

00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:11.099
We will keep enduring.

00:42:11.099 --> 00:42:13.659
So take these lyrics to heart as you go

00:42:13.659 --> 00:42:14.820
to your assignment.

00:42:14.820 --> 00:42:17.659
So let's stand and sing song number 154.

00:42:17.659 --> 00:42:19.780
And then, brother, Leon Weaver, a helper

00:42:19.780 --> 00:42:22.139
to the service community of the governing body,

00:42:22.139 --> 00:42:23.500
will conclude with prayer.
