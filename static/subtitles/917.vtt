00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:13.539
I wish I was a grown-up already.

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:15.140
Do you?

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:19.429
There's so much to learn in becoming a grown-up.

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:21.030
I hate winning.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.730
Can't you hold just make me grow faster?

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:26.629
Good things take time to grow.

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:29.629
Jehovah made us to live forever.

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.829
He put eternity in our hearts.

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:37.579
August.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.119
Take a look at these trees.

00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:45.909
They're already big when your mom and I were your age.

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:48.509
But the stream was watering them.

00:00:49.509 --> 00:00:52.509
Making them grow stronger and taller.

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:00.689
I know you want to grow up.

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:02.689
And you'll get there.

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:06.489
Just walk with Jehovah and enjoy the journey.

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.859
Dad.

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:17.079
Have you seen my ball?

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:21.829
Thanks.

00:01:22.129 --> 00:01:41.750
You for the day, okay?

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:42.250
Okay.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:50.480
Growing up, August felt like he didn't have any friends in the congregation.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000
But recently,

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:58.299
he's been using his time to cultivate a friendship with Ben.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.700
Amen.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.700
Good kid.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.200
New to the congregation.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.200
I can't shake the feeling.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.699
Things have been tough for him at home for a long time.

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:12.099
They've got a great group of friends.

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.099
Harlan.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.900
Chantelle.

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:17.800
And Mallory.

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.569
She's applied for SKE a number of times.

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:24.870
But hasn't been invited yet.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:33.020
Funny.

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:37.020
It can be so easy to size up everybody else's life.

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:40.580
Except you're old.

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.180
It's been years since I've lost my privileges.

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:46.979
Brothers,

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:51.360
I completely understand the decision.

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:53.969
And I,

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:56.169
I fully support it.

00:02:58.469 --> 00:02:58.969
Savior,

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:02.169
we know that you can serve again someday.

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.439
Will I ever be useful again?

00:03:07.840 --> 00:04:39.100
Everything okay?

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.589
It's Ben.

00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:46.290
He's been ignoring me.

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:48.839
What did I do?

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:53.199
Maybe you didn't do anything.

00:04:59.279 --> 00:05:00.079
Everything.

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:02.779
He may be dealing with something.

00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:05.670
You know,

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:06.970
he may need a friend

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:08.569
more than ever.

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:10.670
Even if it doesn't seem like it.

00:05:13.579 --> 00:05:14.180
Take a look at

00:05:14.779 --> 00:05:15.480
Proverbs

00:05:16.079 --> 00:05:17.279
1717.

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:23.829
A true friend shows love at all times.

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:28.259
At all times.

00:05:45.819 --> 00:05:46.920
A true friend

00:05:47.819 --> 00:05:50.519
is a brother born for times of distress.

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:52.920
And shows patience

00:05:53.319 --> 00:05:56.319
when it's hard to understand a friend's actions.

00:05:58.019 --> 00:06:01.519
It can be easier to make a friend than to keep a friend.

00:06:04.009 --> 00:06:05.209
That takes patience

00:06:06.509 --> 00:06:07.610
and time.

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:15.980
Hey,

00:06:16.879 --> 00:06:17.480
great to see you.

00:06:20.449 --> 00:06:21.050
Hey, listen.

00:06:22.649 --> 00:06:23.750
I really wanted to say

00:06:24.449 --> 00:06:24.949
thank you.

00:06:27.029 --> 00:06:27.829
Don't even worry about it.

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:31.790
Ready to play?

00:06:33.089 --> 00:06:33.589
Ready.

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:51.360
We all face obstacles to spiritual growth.

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:05.500
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:08.529
That was clean.

00:07:09.129 --> 00:07:10.029
That was a foul.

00:07:10.629 --> 00:07:11.529
That was a foul.

00:07:33.389 --> 00:07:34.290
My dad's angry.

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:38.060
I'm angry.

00:07:40.069 --> 00:07:41.170
I want to change.

00:07:43.069 --> 00:07:44.170
I just feel stuck.

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:49.300
I'm just like him.

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:53.170
I'm really sorry, Ben.

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:56.920
You don't have to be like him.

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:00.019
You can choose

00:08:00.519 --> 00:08:01.620
who you're going to be.

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:04.420
It just feels like I'm losing battle.

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:09.649
You know, my dad always says

00:08:10.949 --> 00:08:12.050
you're not losing

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:13.350
as long as you're

00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:14.449
trying

00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:17.750
be patient with yourself.

00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:20.350
It will take time.

00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:22.750
But you can do it.

00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:27.350
You already have an idea of what's at the root of your struggle.

00:08:35.059 --> 00:08:37.059
Each time you lose your temper,

00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:39.159
write down what happened,

00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:41.159
how you could have reacted better

00:08:41.559 --> 00:08:42.360
and why

00:08:42.759 --> 00:08:56.490
it before reacting.

00:08:57.590 --> 00:08:59.389
Take a deep breath.

00:09:01.399 --> 00:09:02.899
Colossians 3, 8.

00:09:03.899 --> 00:09:05.299
Put away wrath.

00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:15.649
Proverbs 16, 32.

00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:18.250
The one slow to anger

00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:20.250
is better than a mighty man.

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:26.039
Slow to anger.

00:09:43.299 --> 00:09:44.100
Don't worry about that.

00:09:47.129 --> 00:09:47.929
Sorry about that.

00:09:48.129 --> 00:10:00.159
You really kept your cool out there.

00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:01.159
Good job.

00:10:35.639 --> 00:10:37.539
You know, Eski might happen someday,

00:10:37.639 --> 00:10:41.340
but I'm really excited to be serving where the need is great now.

00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:45.039
It's amazing how you can knock on one door for so long

00:10:45.039 --> 00:10:46.639
and Jehovah opens another.

00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:02.210
We have one last announcement.

00:11:03.309 --> 00:11:05.210
We're happy to announce that Brother Ben Leo

00:11:05.210 --> 00:11:07.210
has been appointed as a ministerial servant.

00:11:38.159 --> 00:11:38.960
See you tonight, Mom.

00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:40.360
Dad.

00:11:41.259 --> 00:11:42.559
Enjoy King of Ministry School.

00:12:00.759 --> 00:12:01.559
What is important

00:12:02.659 --> 00:12:03.559
is not our time,

00:12:04.159 --> 00:12:05.159
but Jehovah's time.

00:12:06.159 --> 00:12:06.860
What I want

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:09.659
may not be what Jehovah knows I need.

00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:21.320
The assembly had a lot of great parts today.

00:12:24.169 --> 00:12:25.970
Thank you for your part.

00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:28.169
I didn't have a part.

00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:30.269
I'm not talking about up there.

00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:33.370
I mean your example.

00:12:34.669 --> 00:12:36.070
You're concerned for others.

00:12:36.669 --> 00:12:39.169
How you contribute in any way you can

00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:42.570
and how you always make time for Jehovah

00:12:43.269 --> 00:12:45.269
for me and for Mom.

00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:51.250
Yeah, you had a part today

00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:53.250
when they talked about helping others.

00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:55.149
The whole time,

00:12:55.950 --> 00:12:57.549
you know, the one person I was thinking about.

00:12:59.250 --> 00:12:59.950
It's you.

00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:02.750
You helped me grow spiritually.

00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:06.049
You never stopped helping me.

00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:19.850
If we're in too big a rush to get somewhere,

00:13:20.549 --> 00:13:23.350
we can miss what Jehovah is giving us right now.

00:13:25.389 --> 00:13:27.590
There's beauty in the journey along the way.

00:13:34.139 --> 00:13:35.940
And while we're waiting to reach our goals,

00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:38.740
let's be grateful for the opportunity,

00:13:39.539 --> 00:13:40.139
the time

00:13:41.539 --> 00:13:42.740
to grow spiritually.

00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:56.230
Hello.

00:13:56.830 --> 00:13:57.730
Hi Xavier.

00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:00.330
After the circuit over series visit this week,

00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:02.429
the other body has some good news for you.

00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:05.629
Good to see you and I meet with you before the meeting.
