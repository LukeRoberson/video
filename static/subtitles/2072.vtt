00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:07.309
What motivates someone to continue knowing more about God?

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:12.310
Can taking a knowledge of our Creator help us to grow in our love for Him?

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:16.309
When you take a knowledge of Jehovah, you see how loving is.

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.309
You start to form a deep appreciation for who Jehovah is.

00:00:20.309 --> 00:00:22.309
You grow in a motivation to please Him.

00:00:22.309 --> 00:00:25.309
And this moves us to grow in our love for Him.

00:00:25.309 --> 00:00:28.309
And it moves us to speak about Him.

00:00:28.309 --> 00:00:36.310
Since 1943, the Gilead School has been training willing ones to grow in their appreciation and accurate knowledge of God.

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:45.310
Attaining a deeper knowledge and appreciation of Jehovah is still emphasized despite the fact that the focus of Gilead training has changed.

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:52.310
Gilead focus now is to help them to be prepared to stabilize the organization in whatever sign that they might get.

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:56.310
So that when they face various challenges in the future, they can be successful.

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:11.310
With this new focus, knowledge and appreciation behind them, the 137th class of Gilead was now ready for graduation on September 13th, 2014, where their Samuel Hurd introduced the program.

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:18.310
Graduation day for the 137th class of Gilead and what a day is going to be.

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:25.310
John Larson, the United States Branch Committee, developed the theme, The Fruitage of the Spirit, is Patience.

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.310
But the thrust of this talk is the application of that quality in two areas.

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:36.310
Number one, patience with Jehovah, number two, patience with ourselves.

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:43.310
To expect perfection out of yourself is totally unrealistic and only leads to disappointment.

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:51.310
Anthony Morris of The Governing Body addressed the audience with the theme, May your heart remain humble and live forever.

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.310
You can see pride. It's just like rose bush. It looks beautiful.

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:03.310
But if a worm gets in there and starts getting to the root of the rose bush, it will bloom for a while, looks nice and soon it's dead.

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.310
If your figure of heart is going to live forever, then you have to be humble.

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:15.310
We just entreat you. May your hearts remain humble and may you enjoy life forever.

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:21.310
Gilead instructor Michael Burnett turned the class's attention to the importance of God's Holy Spirit.

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.310
Jehovah gives his servants enough of his spirit to do the work that they're given to do.

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.310
He does not give them an inadequate measure of his spirit.

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.310
Jehovah does not give the spirit sparingly. He gives you what you need.

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:41.310
Tempor your natural abilities with humility and an obedient spirit.

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.310
And if you do, Jehovah will give you his spirit fully.

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.310
Mark Numer referred to 2 Samuel 6 verses 14 and 20.

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.310
As the basis for the topic, will you dance with me?

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:01.310
Will you be known as one who was helpful to those with little or no responsibility?

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.310
Will you dance with the slave girls? That's the question.

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:13.310
And your attitude and how you treat others will cry resounding yes or no to that very question.

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:20.310
And remember, with more responsibility, it is a victory to do no harm.

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:29.310
You do no harm when you view yourself as a nobody because a nobody does not hurt anybody.

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.310
When you think you're a somebody, you hurt everybody.

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:39.310
Brother William Samuelsen directed the audience's attention to some field service experiences of the students.

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:45.310
And pick out the lessons that might be helpful to you in your ministry.

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:50.310
This book, what does the Bible really teach, provides us much more information.

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:55.310
It's a really big Bible.

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:01.310
Brother William Nankis, next interviewed two couples from the 137th class of Gilead.

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:10.310
If I'm in service and the results aren't great, I should remember that Jehovah is shouting with joy because I'm showing my love to him and I should do the same.

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:18.310
Patient endurance with faith. Gilead has really helped me to deeply appreciate these wonderful qualities.

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:26.310
With Jehovah's help, we want to make our life a success story just like that of Abraham and other faithful servants of Jehovah.

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:31.310
The final talk was delivered by Brother Stephen Lett of the governing body.

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:36.310
He spoke on the theme, observe intently the birds of heaven.

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:39.310
He specifically observed geese.

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:49.310
As geese must fly in formation, you must always treasure and stay in your place in Jehovah's organization.

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:55.310
In imitation of geese, let's continue to cherish our place in Jehovah's organization.

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:07.310
We can encourage each other to keep going as we continue our migration from this old system of things to the new world.

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:13.490
Finally, it was time for graduation.

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:20.490
Gilead school helps me to grow in my knowledge, love, and appreciation of Jehovah.

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:26.490
You know that they are growing in appreciation of God's Word and especially in how to apply it.

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:29.490
To begin to see how God's Word has an effect on them.

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:33.490
And of course, that enhances my appreciation for what I'm teaching.

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:39.490
It's like you're going into the classroom with your friends every day. It's a pleasant experience.

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:49.490
So it isn't just a school for evangelizing. It's a school for biblical or divine education that teaches a way of life.

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:57.490
We spend 20 weeks eating, working, laughing, studying all together.

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:03.490
I made friends for eternity and I will never forget them.
