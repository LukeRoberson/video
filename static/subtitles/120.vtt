00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:25.829
Welcome to JW Broadcasting for November 2024.

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:33.829
On September 14, 2024, the 156th Class of Gilead graduated.

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:38.829
This is the culmination of five months of intensive study

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:41.829
and spiritual refinement.

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:47.829
What kind words of encouragement lie in store in this graduation?

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:50.829
As we watch this portion of the program,

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:55.829
look for something that you can apply in your life.

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.829
For our introductory chairman comments,

00:00:57.829 --> 00:00:59.829
we thought we talked for just a couple of moments

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:04.829
about what a privilege it is to be used by Jehovah.

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:08.829
And when we were kids, sometimes we played games on the school yard, didn't we?

00:01:08.829 --> 00:01:12.829
And maybe if it was a team sport, sometimes there would be two captains selected,

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:16.829
and then the captains would choose from among the kids playing the game,

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:19.829
you know, who was going to be on their team.

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:20.829
And what would happen?

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:24.829
They would pick the best players first, the most skilled, the most talented,

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:27.829
and our goal was just not to be picked last.

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:31.299
But that's okay.

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:36.299
But the point of the illustration is that each captain had in his mind

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.299
what he valued among those potential players,

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.299
and then that guided his choices.

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.299
Well, Jehovah has a work to do,

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.299
and he uses us humans to do an important part of it.

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:52.299
But who will Jehovah choose to use in his service?

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:54.299
What does he value?

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.299
What kind of people is Jehovah pleased to use to do his work?

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:05.299
Well, on that point, let me make one clarification, little context.

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:08.300
When we talk about, in these comments, being used by Jehovah,

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.300
we're not specifically talking about privileges.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.300
Because privileges come and go, and very often it's timing and availability

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.300
and need to play a big part.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.300
But rather, we're talking about being the kind of people

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.300
who cultivate the spiritual qualities that Jehovah values,

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.300
and then therefore are useful to him in whatever assignment

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.300
or work he has to do at a given time.

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.300
Well, on that point, this summer, most of us enjoyed watching the good news

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.300
according to Jesus episode one.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.300
And the events captured in that episode highlight for us,

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.300
in a special way, what Jehovah values in humans,

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.300
and so therefore, who he is pleased to use.

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:57.300
For example, who would Jehovah use to be the earthly mother

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.300
of his only begotten son?

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.300
Would it be someone maybe from a prominent family,

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.300
maybe from a respected in the community?

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.300
Maybe someone wealthy, so that his son would be sure to be cared for.

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.300
Maybe someone from the capital city in Jerusalem.

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.300
Well, that might be okay, but what does the Bible say?

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.300
Turn with me, please, to the Book of Luke, chapter 1.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:30.969
And let's read together, Luke 1, 26, and 27.

00:03:30.969 --> 00:03:34.969
In her sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God

00:03:34.969 --> 00:03:37.969
to a city of Galilee named Nazareth.

00:03:37.969 --> 00:03:42.969
To a virgin, promised in marriage to a man named Joseph of David's house,

00:03:42.969 --> 00:03:46.969
and the name of the virgin was Mary.

00:03:46.969 --> 00:03:50.969
And we remember from this summer's video,

00:03:50.969 --> 00:03:53.969
this is who Jehovah chose Mary, a humble, young woman,

00:03:53.969 --> 00:03:58.969
of little means materially from an insignificant city called Nazareth.

00:03:58.969 --> 00:04:03.500
But why? Why did Jehovah choose Mary?

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.500
What mattered most, and what did he see in Mary that assured him

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.500
she was the right choice?

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:17.500
Well, in Mary, Jehovah saw a deeply spiritual, humble, obedient, young woman.

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.500
And as we get to know Mary in the Bible account,

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:25.500
it becomes very clear why Jehovah chose her for this important assignment.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:30.500
For example, as soon as she understood from the angel Gabriel what the assignment was

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:35.500
that Jehovah had in mind for her, this assignment that would require a miracle,

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:41.500
this assignment that would change her life forever, what was her reaction?

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.779
Verse 38, then Mary said,

00:04:45.779 --> 00:04:49.779
look, Jehovah's slave girl,

00:04:49.779 --> 00:04:53.779
may it happen to me according to your declaration?

00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:58.779
And there she is, we remember that moment in the video, humble obedience

00:04:58.779 --> 00:05:00.779
and submission to Jehovah's will.

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:02.779
Did Mary have questions undoubtedly?

00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:05.779
But she didn't need to know all the answers to those questions.

00:05:05.779 --> 00:05:08.779
All she needed was that the request was coming from Jehovah,

00:05:08.779 --> 00:05:11.779
and so the answer was yes.

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:15.779
Humble, obedience, and submission to Jehovah's will.

00:05:15.779 --> 00:05:18.779
Now, we further see what Jehovah saw in Mary.

00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:23.779
When we hear her words that she spoke in Luke 146 through 55,

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:27.779
we won't read that, but we remember this little speech that she gave there,

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:29.779
and here's the moment from the video.

00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:32.779
These two women with very unique circumstances

00:05:33.779 --> 00:05:37.779
as they're reflecting on what Jehovah was doing in their case.

00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:40.779
And Mary, as we know, in this few verses,

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:44.779
makes copious references to passages in the Hebrew scriptures.

00:05:44.779 --> 00:05:47.779
And she shows herself to be one who loved God's Word,

00:05:47.779 --> 00:05:51.779
who treasured it, who read it, studied it, meditated on it.

00:05:51.779 --> 00:05:55.779
And in her situation, reading God's Word, she felt a connection to Hannah,

00:05:55.779 --> 00:05:58.779
and she felt a connection to the Psalmist.

00:05:58.779 --> 00:06:03.779
These are the things that motivated and formed her words.

00:06:03.779 --> 00:06:07.779
So Jehovah used humble, spiritual, obedient Mary

00:06:07.779 --> 00:06:11.779
to be the earthly mother of his son.

00:06:11.779 --> 00:06:12.779
Well, another example.

00:06:12.779 --> 00:06:16.779
When the time came to announce the birth of his son,

00:06:16.779 --> 00:06:18.779
who did Jehovah choose to tell?

00:06:18.779 --> 00:06:20.779
Would it be the prominent officials in Bethlehem?

00:06:20.779 --> 00:06:22.779
Would it be the leaders of the Sanhedrin?

00:06:22.779 --> 00:06:25.779
Maybe the high priest? Maybe Herod?

00:06:25.779 --> 00:06:27.779
Well, what does the Bible say?

00:06:27.779 --> 00:06:33.319
Turn over to Luke chapter 2 and verses 8 and 9.

00:06:33.319 --> 00:06:36.319
Luke 2.8, there were also in the same region,

00:06:36.319 --> 00:06:39.319
shepherds, living out of doors,

00:06:39.319 --> 00:06:42.319
and keeping watch in the night over their flocks.

00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:44.319
Suddenly, Jehovah's angels stood before them,

00:06:44.319 --> 00:06:47.319
and Jehovah's glory gleamed around them,

00:06:47.319 --> 00:06:49.319
and they became very fearful.

00:06:49.319 --> 00:06:51.319
And what was the announcement, verse 11,

00:06:51.319 --> 00:06:55.319
for today there was born to you in David's city, a Savior,

00:06:55.319 --> 00:06:58.319
who is Christ, the Lord.

00:06:58.319 --> 00:07:01.319
This Jehovah appeared to these humble shepherds,

00:07:01.319 --> 00:07:04.319
men who would treasure this privilege

00:07:04.319 --> 00:07:06.319
to see the infant God's son,

00:07:06.319 --> 00:07:09.319
men whose reaction would reassure Joseph and Mary

00:07:09.319 --> 00:07:11.319
about how special this child was,

00:07:11.319 --> 00:07:15.319
and of course would bring praise and glory to Jehovah's name.

00:07:15.319 --> 00:07:18.699
Well, soon the time came for Mary and Joseph

00:07:18.699 --> 00:07:21.699
to go to the temple for the purification offering,

00:07:21.699 --> 00:07:25.699
and so who would Jehovah use to welcome his son,

00:07:25.699 --> 00:07:29.699
and even to acknowledge Jesus' future role as the Messiah?

00:07:29.699 --> 00:07:32.699
Well, perhaps Mary thought that the officiating priests

00:07:32.699 --> 00:07:36.699
might make some comment about what Jesus' future role would be,

00:07:36.699 --> 00:07:39.699
but who did Jehovah choose to do this?

00:07:39.699 --> 00:07:43.699
The faithful man, the simian.

00:07:43.699 --> 00:07:46.699
Simian had been faithful to Jehovah his whole life,

00:07:46.699 --> 00:07:50.699
and Jehovah appreciated and loved him for his faithful course,

00:07:50.699 --> 00:07:53.699
and had promised Simian that he would have this privilege

00:07:53.699 --> 00:07:56.699
to see the Christ before he died.

00:07:56.699 --> 00:07:59.699
And finally, who would Jehovah use

00:07:59.699 --> 00:08:02.699
to further emphasize the importance of this infant child,

00:08:02.699 --> 00:08:07.699
and to proclaim it to all those in the temple area?

00:08:07.699 --> 00:08:10.699
Faithful Anna, who was always present,

00:08:10.699 --> 00:08:12.699
never missing from the temple,

00:08:12.699 --> 00:08:14.699
she was steadfast in her theocratic routine

00:08:14.699 --> 00:08:17.699
and in her appreciation for pure worship.

00:08:17.699 --> 00:08:21.699
Jehovah could count on her to be present that day

00:08:21.699 --> 00:08:27.699
when Joseph and Mary would arrive with Jesus Christ.

00:08:27.699 --> 00:08:30.699
Well, thinking about those who Jehovah use

00:08:30.699 --> 00:08:32.700
to carry out his will in these various ways,

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:34.700
in connection with his son,

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:36.700
and thinking about what a privilege it is

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:38.700
to be used for anything in Jehovah's service,

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:40.700
leads us to ask the question,

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:42.700
well, how can I be the kind of person

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:46.700
that Jehovah would be pleased to use?

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:48.700
Well, as these examples teach us,

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:52.700
it's by focusing on what matters most to Jehovah.

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:53.700
And what is it?

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:54.700
Is it prominence?

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:55.700
Is it fame?

00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:56.700
Is it wealth?

00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:57.700
Is it personality?

00:08:57.700 --> 00:08:59.700
No, it's spirituality, isn't it?

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:01.700
And so we become useful to Jehovah

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:04.700
when we cultivate these beautiful spiritual qualities

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:06.700
that Jehovah appreciates,

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:08.700
and many of them, the same ones that Mary

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:12.700
and the Shepherds and Simian Anna showed,

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:15.700
such as deep spirituality, humility, and obedience,

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:18.700
like Mary, appreciation for spiritual things

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:20.700
like those humble Shepherds,

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:23.700
the faithful waiting attitude like Simian,

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:28.700
and constancy in your theocratic routine like Anna.

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:31.700
Jehovah sees such sincere efforts

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:33.700
and beautiful spiritual qualities

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:35.700
and he values them.

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:37.700
It is qualities that matter to Jehovah.

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:39.700
It is substance that matters to Jehovah.

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:40.700
Not what appears to the eyes,

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:43.700
but what is in the heart.

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:46.700
So as you go to your assignments now,

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:48.700
remember these fine examples,

00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:50.700
men and women who pleased Jehovah,

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:53.700
not because they were impressive by the world standards,

00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:56.700
but because they developed qualities

00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:57.700
that Jehovah appreciated

00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:00.700
and a life course of humble loyal service to him.

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:02.700
These are ones that Jehovah appreciated,

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:05.700
ones that Jehovah could use to do his will,

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:08.700
and always treasure the privilege

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:11.700
of being used by Jehovah.

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:13.700
And we know that the rest of the program

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:15.700
will help us to be the kind of people

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:17.700
that Jehovah loves, approves of,

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:20.700
and is pleased to use in his service.

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:31.509
The next part of the program is the inside story,

00:10:31.509 --> 00:10:33.509
and the operative word is story.

00:10:33.509 --> 00:10:34.509
Isn't it?

00:10:34.509 --> 00:10:37.509
Because each one of Jehovah's servants has a story,

00:10:37.509 --> 00:10:39.509
has a journey with Jehovah,

00:10:39.509 --> 00:10:42.509
and we always enjoy hearing about some of the stories

00:10:42.509 --> 00:10:45.509
of our Gilead students.

00:10:45.509 --> 00:10:47.509
So in this episode of the Inside Story,

00:10:47.509 --> 00:10:50.509
we will have interviews spanning four different countries

00:10:50.509 --> 00:10:54.509
and also a brief tour of a notable Bible land.

00:10:54.509 --> 00:10:56.509
So please enjoy the Inside Story.

00:10:56.509 --> 00:11:29.090
Welcome to this edition of the Inside Story.

00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:32.090
Today, we will get to know six

00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:38.090
of the 48 students representing the 156th Class of Gilead.

00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:43.090
To my left, I have Sister Hanta Razaf Mandimbi

00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:45.090
from Madagascar.

00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:48.090
Next to Hanta is Adalia and Manny Luna

00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:50.090
from the United States.

00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:55.090
To my far right is Simon and Yoshi Hori from Japan.

00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:57.090
And last but not least,

00:11:57.090 --> 00:12:00.090
we have Brother Marco Caproni from Italy.

00:12:00.090 --> 00:12:02.090
Welcome to all six of you,

00:12:02.090 --> 00:12:04.090
and we look forward to hearing

00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:07.090
what you have to share with us today.

00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:09.090
Why don't we start

00:12:09.090 --> 00:12:12.090
by first hearing how long you've been

00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:14.090
in your respective Bethels

00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:16.090
and what your current assignments are?

00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:19.090
Why don't we start with you, Hanta?

00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:24.090
I've been serving at Madagascar Bethel for 24 years.

00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:25.090
Nice.

00:12:25.090 --> 00:12:29.090
And currently I'm serving in one of the translation teams there.

00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:31.090
Excellent. Adalia.

00:12:31.090 --> 00:12:34.090
We are currently serving in the United States branch,

00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:37.090
Wachill Complex for about 13 years.

00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:39.090
And my assignment is actually a split assignment

00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:42.090
between food service and health care department.

00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:44.090
Okay, very good.

00:12:44.090 --> 00:12:45.090
Manny.

00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:46.090
And I, along with Adalia,

00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:48.090
have been serving at the United States branch

00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:49.090
for about 13 years,

00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:51.090
and I currently work with the service department.

00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:52.090
Very good.

00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:55.090
Let's switch over to you, Simon, please.

00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:59.090
I have been in the Japan branch for 16 years,

00:12:59.090 --> 00:13:02.090
and my assignment is the computer department.

00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:04.090
Okay, well good.

00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:05.090
And Yoshi?

00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:08.090
And I've been in the Japan branch for six years,

00:13:08.090 --> 00:13:10.090
and now I serve in the legal department.

00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:11.090
Okay, very good.

00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:13.090
And please, Marco.

00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:17.090
I've been serving an Italy branch in Rome for 18 years,

00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:21.090
and actually I'm serving in the public information department.

00:13:21.090 --> 00:13:22.090
Excellent.

00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:25.090
Well now that we've got a chance to learn a little bit about you,

00:13:25.090 --> 00:13:28.090
let's start off with Simon.

00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:34.090
Simon, I understand that you were baptized at 10 years of age.

00:13:34.090 --> 00:13:35.090
Yeah.

00:13:35.090 --> 00:13:37.090
Can you tell us about what your father did

00:13:37.090 --> 00:13:41.090
to help you make spiritual progress at such a young age?

00:13:41.090 --> 00:13:46.090
Well, my father was very creative.

00:13:46.090 --> 00:13:47.090
Explain.

00:13:47.090 --> 00:13:51.090
For example, as a family,

00:13:51.090 --> 00:13:53.090
we enjoyed playing a game,

00:13:53.090 --> 00:13:56.090
named Bible Golf.

00:13:56.090 --> 00:13:57.090
Okay.

00:13:57.090 --> 00:14:02.090
It's a simple game.

00:14:02.090 --> 00:14:07.090
So the winner is whoever can open to a specific Bible verse

00:14:07.090 --> 00:14:09.090
in the fewest attempt.

00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:12.090
So if I can open the verse in the first attempt,

00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:14.090
it's a hole in one.

00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:15.090
All right.

00:14:15.090 --> 00:14:20.090
And three attempts, it's a birdie.

00:14:20.090 --> 00:14:22.090
Something like this.

00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:26.090
And another game I can still remember is Jehovah's Witnesses

00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:28.090
Game of Life,

00:14:29.090 --> 00:14:33.090
which is a bold game with two circles on it,

00:14:33.090 --> 00:14:36.090
and you can start from outside circle,

00:14:36.090 --> 00:14:38.090
which represents non-witness life.

00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:40.090
Non-witness life.

00:14:40.090 --> 00:14:41.090
Okay.

00:14:41.090 --> 00:14:43.090
And if you progress properly,

00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:45.090
Bible study,

00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:47.090
and dedication, assembly,

00:14:47.090 --> 00:14:51.090
or convention, then you can enter into inner circle,

00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:54.090
which represents witness life.

00:14:54.090 --> 00:14:57.090
But there is a time limit called Armageddon.

00:14:58.090 --> 00:15:03.399
So when the alarm goes off,

00:15:03.399 --> 00:15:07.399
you can enter into paradise if you are in the inner circle.

00:15:07.399 --> 00:15:09.399
And it's so much fun,

00:15:09.399 --> 00:15:13.399
because there are also something blocks along the way.

00:15:13.399 --> 00:15:16.399
And your father came up with this game.

00:15:16.399 --> 00:15:17.399
Yes.

00:15:17.399 --> 00:15:19.399
Well, obviously he was very creative.

00:15:19.399 --> 00:15:21.399
Did he do anything else to help you?

00:15:21.399 --> 00:15:24.399
Well, the knowledge book came out.

00:15:25.399 --> 00:15:29.399
He asked me and my sister if we wanted to get baptized

00:15:29.399 --> 00:15:31.399
within six months.

00:15:31.399 --> 00:15:33.399
And we said yes.

00:15:33.399 --> 00:15:35.399
From then on, each morning,

00:15:35.399 --> 00:15:37.399
he would leave the house,

00:15:37.399 --> 00:15:39.399
knock on the door,

00:15:39.399 --> 00:15:42.399
introduce himself as brother Hori,

00:15:42.399 --> 00:15:45.399
and conducted Bible study with us.

00:15:45.399 --> 00:15:48.399
And we have to serve tea for him.

00:15:48.399 --> 00:15:53.929
Now I understand he wanted to teach us

00:15:53.929 --> 00:15:57.929
the Bible study is a serious thing in our life.

00:15:57.929 --> 00:15:59.929
It's unique,

00:15:59.929 --> 00:16:02.929
but I was able to get baptized within a year.

00:16:02.929 --> 00:16:04.929
Well, obviously it worked,

00:16:04.929 --> 00:16:07.929
because you are with us today.

00:16:07.929 --> 00:16:10.929
Well, once you were baptized,

00:16:10.929 --> 00:16:13.929
was it always smooth sailing for you Simon?

00:16:13.929 --> 00:16:16.929
Honestly, no, not always.

00:16:16.929 --> 00:16:18.929
As I grew older,

00:16:18.929 --> 00:16:20.929
I started struggling,

00:16:20.929 --> 00:16:23.929
and I wanted to be exemplarily in congregation,

00:16:23.929 --> 00:16:26.929
but I liked computer very much.

00:16:26.929 --> 00:16:31.929
So I wanted to be an engineer in an IT company.

00:16:31.929 --> 00:16:32.929
Big dreams, huh?

00:16:32.929 --> 00:16:34.929
Yeah, okay.

00:16:34.929 --> 00:16:36.929
But eventually,

00:16:36.929 --> 00:16:39.929
the Timothy drama came out.

00:16:39.929 --> 00:16:41.929
And in that drama,

00:16:41.929 --> 00:16:44.929
the boss of Paul encouraged Timothy

00:16:44.929 --> 00:16:46.929
not to use his skill

00:16:46.929 --> 00:16:48.929
in Seidron's world,

00:16:48.929 --> 00:16:50.929
but for Jehovah.

00:16:50.929 --> 00:16:53.929
That was the turning point for me.

00:16:53.929 --> 00:16:56.929
Instead of pursuing secular work,

00:16:56.929 --> 00:16:58.929
I started pioneering,

00:16:58.929 --> 00:17:00.929
and then I came to love it.

00:17:00.929 --> 00:17:01.929
Oh, wise choice.

00:17:01.929 --> 00:17:04.930
Let's talk to your wife Yoshi for just a moment.

00:17:04.930 --> 00:17:07.930
Now Yoshi, you were born in Japan,

00:17:07.930 --> 00:17:11.930
but I understand that you and your family moved around a bit.

00:17:11.930 --> 00:17:13.930
Can you tell us a little bit about that?

00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:15.930
Yes, so my father,

00:17:15.930 --> 00:17:17.930
he wasn't a witness at the time,

00:17:17.930 --> 00:17:19.930
and his work necessitated them.

00:17:19.930 --> 00:17:21.930
You move around quite a bit.

00:17:21.930 --> 00:17:23.930
So I remember I was five

00:17:23.930 --> 00:17:26.930
when we were living in Osaka, in Japan.

00:17:26.930 --> 00:17:30.930
Then we moved to London in Britain.

00:17:30.930 --> 00:17:33.930
We were there for four years.

00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:36.930
And then after that, we all moved to Scotland.

00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:39.930
So I lived in Glasgow for five years.

00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:42.930
After that, we all moved back to Tokyo.

00:17:42.930 --> 00:17:45.930
And later, when I was an adult,

00:17:45.930 --> 00:17:48.930
I moved on my own to serve

00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:50.930
where the need was great in Tanzania.

00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:52.930
I stayed there for six years.

00:17:52.930 --> 00:17:55.930
And after that, I moved back and now we're here.

00:17:55.930 --> 00:17:57.930
And we're happy to have you.

00:17:57.930 --> 00:18:01.930
Now you've got to live in some pretty fascinating places

00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:03.930
over those years.

00:18:03.930 --> 00:18:07.930
What did you learn about yourself and culture

00:18:07.930 --> 00:18:10.930
from living in those places?

00:18:10.930 --> 00:18:13.930
Well, you know, when I was young,

00:18:13.930 --> 00:18:16.930
I honestly didn't really appreciate it.

00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:19.930
But now that I've grown older,

00:18:19.930 --> 00:18:21.930
I feel that it's taught me to understand

00:18:21.930 --> 00:18:26.930
that there's so many different ways of looking at something

00:18:26.930 --> 00:18:29.930
in so many different ways of doing something.

00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:32.930
But actually, all of them are really, really good.

00:18:32.930 --> 00:18:36.930
And it's a blessing to have so many different personalities

00:18:36.930 --> 00:18:37.930
with us.

00:18:37.930 --> 00:18:40.930
And I just love working with these variety of brothers

00:18:40.930 --> 00:18:41.930
and sisters now.

00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:43.930
Oh, obviously looking back on it,

00:18:43.930 --> 00:18:44.930
you learned quite a bit.

00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:46.930
Thank you for sharing that.

00:18:46.930 --> 00:18:49.930
Let's switch over to you now, Hanta.

00:18:49.930 --> 00:18:52.930
I understand that you were not raised

00:18:52.930 --> 00:18:54.930
as one of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:18:54.930 --> 00:18:58.930
Can you tell us a little bit about your background, please?

00:18:58.930 --> 00:19:01.930
I was raised in a religious family.

00:19:01.930 --> 00:19:05.930
We used to go to a Protestant church every week.

00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:09.930
And my siblings and I even attended Sunday school for a while.

00:19:09.930 --> 00:19:10.930
Okay.

00:19:10.930 --> 00:19:15.930
Now, although your father never became one of Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:19:15.930 --> 00:19:19.930
how was he instrumental in leading you to the truth?

00:19:19.930 --> 00:19:24.930
My father welcomed anyone who knocked

00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:27.930
at our door in the name of religion.

00:19:27.930 --> 00:19:31.930
And Jehovah's Witnesses were among these people.

00:19:31.930 --> 00:19:34.930
Every time they stopped by,

00:19:34.930 --> 00:19:38.930
they would leave magazines, books, brochures.

00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:43.930
What I really appreciate in those publications

00:19:43.930 --> 00:19:46.930
is God's promise of a paradise Earth.

00:19:46.930 --> 00:19:49.930
I really liked the pictures of paradise

00:19:49.930 --> 00:19:51.930
in those publications.

00:19:51.930 --> 00:19:56.930
So much so that my siblings and I would trace those pictures,

00:19:56.930 --> 00:19:59.930
paint it down and hang them on the wall.

00:19:59.930 --> 00:20:03.930
Your parents were okay with you redecorating like this?

00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:10.930
One day, our father bought the leaf forever book

00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:12.930
from the Witnesses.

00:20:12.930 --> 00:20:15.930
It was then that the Bible study was started.

00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:18.930
From the first meeting I attended,

00:20:18.930 --> 00:20:22.930
I was so impressed by the warm welcome I received

00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:24.930
that I said to myself,

00:20:24.930 --> 00:20:28.930
I want to belong to these people.

00:20:28.930 --> 00:20:32.930
Eventually, all my siblings and I,

00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:35.930
along with our mother, embraced the truth.

00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:38.930
Actually, one of my brothers and I got

00:20:38.930 --> 00:20:40.930
baptized together on the same day.

00:20:40.930 --> 00:20:42.930
Oh, that must have been really special for you.

00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:44.930
Thank you for sharing that with the Santa.

00:20:44.930 --> 00:20:46.930
We'll come back to you.

00:20:46.930 --> 00:20:48.930
Let's go over to Adalia now.

00:20:48.930 --> 00:20:51.930
Adalia, you were born, raised,

00:20:51.930 --> 00:20:55.930
and spent your early teenage years in Brooklyn, New York.

00:20:55.930 --> 00:20:59.930
How was that for you growing up around World Headquarters?

00:20:59.930 --> 00:21:02.930
It was a beautiful, positive experience.

00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:05.930
Getting to see self-sacrificing brothers and sisters

00:21:05.930 --> 00:21:07.930
give all they could to Jehovah

00:21:07.930 --> 00:21:10.930
and also see how happy and excited they were

00:21:10.930 --> 00:21:13.930
in their service was a beautiful example.

00:21:13.930 --> 00:21:17.930
This helped instill in me goals and really plant seeds

00:21:17.930 --> 00:21:20.930
and put in me the desire to want to live that same kind of life.

00:21:20.930 --> 00:21:22.930
We could understand that.

00:21:22.930 --> 00:21:27.930
Now, eventually, you and your family moved to Florida.

00:21:28.930 --> 00:21:30.930
That's where you met Manny.

00:21:30.930 --> 00:21:32.930
You two were eventually married.

00:21:32.930 --> 00:21:36.930
You should have stayed in Brooklyn, see?

00:21:36.930 --> 00:21:39.930
You met Manny and you two were married.

00:21:39.930 --> 00:21:41.930
What next?

00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:44.930
So shortly after we got married before our first year anniversary,

00:21:44.930 --> 00:21:46.930
we started regular pain hearing.

00:21:46.930 --> 00:21:48.930
Then after that, we were invited to serve

00:21:48.930 --> 00:21:52.930
with Anita's great in a very rural part of Florida,

00:21:52.930 --> 00:21:54.930
kind of the Orange Grove region,

00:21:54.930 --> 00:21:56.930
very different to what we both grew up.

00:21:57.930 --> 00:21:59.930
We were both used to the city life.

00:21:59.930 --> 00:22:02.930
But we went to that area and immersed ourselves

00:22:02.930 --> 00:22:06.930
with the congregation, beautiful, young congregation

00:22:06.930 --> 00:22:08.930
who worked hard in the ministry.

00:22:08.930 --> 00:22:11.930
And we grew to really love those brothers

00:22:11.930 --> 00:22:13.930
and Jehovah blessed the hard work

00:22:13.930 --> 00:22:15.930
that was being done in that area.

00:22:15.930 --> 00:22:16.930
How long were you there?

00:22:16.930 --> 00:22:18.930
We were there for 10 years.

00:22:18.930 --> 00:22:20.930
And during that time period,

00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:22.930
that one congregation that we were at

00:22:22.930 --> 00:22:24.930
actually turned into five congregations.

00:22:25.930 --> 00:22:27.930
Over to your excellent.

00:22:27.930 --> 00:22:30.930
Now Manny, clearly, yourself and Adalia,

00:22:30.930 --> 00:22:33.930
you were busy in Jehovah's service.

00:22:33.930 --> 00:22:35.930
Was that the end of the extent

00:22:35.930 --> 00:22:37.930
of your pursuing theocratic goals?

00:22:37.930 --> 00:22:39.930
No, not at all.

00:22:39.930 --> 00:22:42.930
Adalia and I made an effort to live a simple life

00:22:42.930 --> 00:22:44.930
so that we could give all we could to Jehovah

00:22:44.930 --> 00:22:46.930
without any distractions.

00:22:46.930 --> 00:22:48.930
That allowed us to pioneer.

00:22:48.930 --> 00:22:50.930
It also allowed us to move to that area

00:22:50.930 --> 00:22:51.930
where there was greater need.

00:22:51.930 --> 00:22:54.930
But to further make ourselves available,

00:22:54.930 --> 00:22:58.930
we applied to Bethel several times.

00:22:58.930 --> 00:23:00.930
Okay, that's a little nebulous.

00:23:00.930 --> 00:23:02.930
Several times.

00:23:02.930 --> 00:23:05.930
How many times did you apply to Bethel?

00:23:05.930 --> 00:23:09.930
It was only 12 times.

00:23:09.930 --> 00:23:12.930
12 times.

00:23:12.930 --> 00:23:15.930
What part of know did you not understand?

00:23:15.930 --> 00:23:18.930
No, no, please tell us.

00:23:19.930 --> 00:23:21.930
What caused you to keep applying

00:23:21.930 --> 00:23:24.930
when you weren't receiving a response to come?

00:23:24.930 --> 00:23:26.930
As you can see, certainly,

00:23:26.930 --> 00:23:29.930
we were very persistent.

00:23:29.930 --> 00:23:31.930
We wanted to keep our options open

00:23:31.930 --> 00:23:34.930
and allowed Jehovah to decide where we would serve.

00:23:34.930 --> 00:23:36.930
But you know, when we looked back at it,

00:23:36.930 --> 00:23:39.930
we realized that applying to Bethel all those times

00:23:39.930 --> 00:23:42.930
and not getting accepted was just simply

00:23:42.930 --> 00:23:44.930
because it wasn't our time.

00:23:44.930 --> 00:23:45.930
What do you mean by that?

00:23:45.930 --> 00:23:47.930
Was it your time?

00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:49.930
There we were in our assignment,

00:23:49.930 --> 00:23:51.930
but wanting to be at Bethel.

00:23:51.930 --> 00:23:54.930
Jehovah knew we had a lot to learn

00:23:54.930 --> 00:23:56.930
and he allowed that assignment

00:23:56.930 --> 00:23:59.930
to give us the training that we needed.

00:23:59.930 --> 00:24:01.930
And those 12 applications

00:24:01.930 --> 00:24:05.930
or those 12 times that we applied taught us a lot,

00:24:05.930 --> 00:24:08.930
taught us patience, taught us to wait on Jehovah,

00:24:08.930 --> 00:24:10.930
taught us appreciation.

00:24:10.930 --> 00:24:13.930
So even though we wanted to make ourselves available

00:24:13.930 --> 00:24:16.930
to do more by means of Bethel service,

00:24:16.930 --> 00:24:19.930
there was a lot of lessons that we still needed to learn.

00:24:19.930 --> 00:24:22.930
We needed to learn to focus, love, and appreciate

00:24:22.930 --> 00:24:25.930
the privileges we already had up to that point

00:24:25.930 --> 00:24:28.930
in order to be able to fully appreciate

00:24:28.930 --> 00:24:31.930
our future Bethel assignment.

00:24:31.930 --> 00:24:33.930
And what a blessing it was.

00:24:33.930 --> 00:24:36.930
Being with those brothers and sisters for those years

00:24:36.930 --> 00:24:38.930
and being able to witness that growth,

00:24:38.930 --> 00:24:41.930
it was amazing and we finally look back at it

00:24:41.930 --> 00:24:45.930
and certainly our memories that we truly treasure.

00:24:45.930 --> 00:24:48.930
Well, those are some valuable lessons that you learned.

00:24:48.930 --> 00:24:50.930
We're glad that Jehovah gave you that training.

00:24:50.930 --> 00:24:53.930
We're sure it has served you well.

00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:56.930
Let's shift over to you now, Marco.

00:24:56.930 --> 00:24:58.930
Would you mind telling us a little bit

00:24:58.930 --> 00:25:00.930
about your family background?

00:25:00.930 --> 00:25:01.930
Sure.

00:25:01.930 --> 00:25:04.930
So growing up, I was raised as a Catholic

00:25:04.930 --> 00:25:09.930
and I used to go every Sunday to the church.

00:25:09.930 --> 00:25:11.930
Yeah.

00:25:11.930 --> 00:25:14.930
But then, when I was 17 years old,

00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:17.930
my uncle began to study the Bible with Jehovah's Witnesses

00:25:17.930 --> 00:25:22.930
and observing the big changes that he made in his life in good

00:25:22.930 --> 00:25:24.930
and how happy he became.

00:25:24.930 --> 00:25:27.930
Maybe really curious about the Bible.

00:25:27.930 --> 00:25:29.930
What's a powerful book?

00:25:29.930 --> 00:25:32.930
Now, it is to change life in such a way.

00:25:32.930 --> 00:25:35.930
And so I accepted to study the Bible as well.

00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:39.930
And when I was 19 years old, I got baptized.

00:25:39.930 --> 00:25:43.930
And later on, I started the service as a regular pioneer.

00:25:43.930 --> 00:25:47.930
I attended the ministry at Trinity School or the MTS.

00:25:47.930 --> 00:25:49.930
And yes, I said, well, do you?

00:25:49.930 --> 00:25:52.930
For the last 18 years, I've been serving a Bethel in Rome.

00:25:52.930 --> 00:25:54.930
Okay, excellent.

00:25:54.930 --> 00:25:57.930
Now, during your time here at Gilead,

00:25:57.930 --> 00:26:02.930
it became clear that you have a real love for history, Marco.

00:26:02.930 --> 00:26:09.809
Now, we all thought,

00:26:09.809 --> 00:26:13.809
was there anything that was part of the Gilead curriculum

00:26:13.809 --> 00:26:16.809
that particularly caught your attention?

00:26:16.809 --> 00:26:18.809
Yes.

00:26:18.809 --> 00:26:21.809
Here at Gilead, we have many artifacts on display.

00:26:21.809 --> 00:26:24.809
But there is something in particular that caught my attention.

00:26:24.809 --> 00:26:27.809
And I brought it here to show you.

00:26:27.809 --> 00:26:28.809
Really?

00:26:28.809 --> 00:26:29.809
Yes.

00:26:29.809 --> 00:26:31.809
Does the Gilead office know that you have this?

00:26:31.809 --> 00:26:33.809
I will bring it back.

00:26:33.809 --> 00:26:34.809
Sure.

00:26:34.809 --> 00:26:35.809
All right.

00:26:35.809 --> 00:26:36.809
Where do we have?

00:26:36.809 --> 00:26:37.809
It's a coin.

00:26:37.809 --> 00:26:38.809
Okay.

00:26:38.809 --> 00:26:39.809
Tell us about it.

00:26:39.809 --> 00:26:41.809
This coin is authentic coin,

00:26:41.809 --> 00:26:45.809
minted by Emperor Niro in 66th Common Era.

00:26:45.809 --> 00:26:49.809
He wanted to celebrate a period of peace.

00:26:49.809 --> 00:26:52.809
In fact, if you look carefully on one side,

00:26:52.809 --> 00:26:54.809
you can see one door.

00:26:54.809 --> 00:26:55.809
Okay, now I can see that.

00:26:55.809 --> 00:26:58.809
But can you all see this?

00:26:58.809 --> 00:26:59.809
Oh, okay.

00:26:59.809 --> 00:27:00.809
Oh, wait a minute.

00:27:00.809 --> 00:27:01.809
There it is.

00:27:01.809 --> 00:27:02.809
There it is.

00:27:02.809 --> 00:27:06.809
So, this door is the door of an ancient temple in Rome.

00:27:06.809 --> 00:27:10.809
And this door was kept closed during the period of peace.

00:27:10.809 --> 00:27:16.809
And if a Niro wanted to boast that it was capable to bring peace into the empire.

00:27:16.809 --> 00:27:19.809
But there was 66th Common Era.

00:27:19.809 --> 00:27:24.809
And the prophecy of Jesus about the destruction of Jerusalem had to be fulfilled.

00:27:24.809 --> 00:27:25.809
There it is.

00:27:25.809 --> 00:27:28.809
In fact, few months after minting this coin,

00:27:28.809 --> 00:27:35.809
Niro was forced to send the military army down to Judea to settle

00:27:35.809 --> 00:27:37.809
the Jewish revolt.

00:27:37.809 --> 00:27:39.809
We said this gallows.

00:27:39.809 --> 00:27:44.809
And these facts we know that led to the destruction of Jerusalem and the temple in 70th Common Era.

00:27:44.809 --> 00:27:49.809
So you see, a coin like this can remind us a precious lesson

00:27:49.809 --> 00:27:52.809
that Bible prophecies always fulfill,

00:27:52.809 --> 00:27:56.809
even though propaganda of this work can say differently.

00:27:56.809 --> 00:27:58.809
Nice lesson.

00:27:58.809 --> 00:28:00.809
I see that you like this story.

00:28:00.809 --> 00:28:03.809
Would you like to know more about Bible history and Rome?

00:28:03.809 --> 00:28:04.809
Of course.

00:28:05.809 --> 00:28:14.789
I have a short video to watch together.

00:28:14.789 --> 00:28:18.710
Let's see it.

00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:21.710
Visiting some of the archaeological sites of Italy

00:28:21.710 --> 00:28:25.710
can help us to imagine what life was like for the early Christians.

00:28:25.710 --> 00:28:29.710
Would you like to come with me for a quick tour?

00:28:29.710 --> 00:28:31.710
Let's begin here.

00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:35.710
Located about 10 kilometers or 6 miles west of Naples

00:28:35.710 --> 00:28:38.710
was the ancient poor city of Putulai.

00:28:38.710 --> 00:28:41.710
Today, it is known as Botswali.

00:28:41.710 --> 00:28:47.710
In about 59 CE, the Apostle Paul arrived here by boat as a prisoner.

00:28:47.710 --> 00:28:51.710
From here, Paul will now begin the long journey to Rome

00:28:51.710 --> 00:28:55.710
where he would eventually stand before Caesar himself.

00:28:55.710 --> 00:29:00.710
One of the most famous Roman highways is called the Appian Way.

00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:04.710
It averages 6 meters or 20 feet in width

00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:08.710
and was paved with large lava blocks.

00:29:08.710 --> 00:29:14.710
It was on this very road that Paul traveled to the city of Rome.

00:29:14.710 --> 00:29:18.710
Along the way, Paul eventually came to a busy 3D center

00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:21.710
known as the Marketplace of Apius.

00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:25.710
And a leader for the north was a rest area like Anine,

00:29:25.710 --> 00:29:28.710
known as the Three Taverns.

00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:30.710
Having heard about Paul coming,

00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:33.710
Christians from Rome organized a group of brothers

00:29:33.710 --> 00:29:36.710
to meet the Apostle aboard of these stops.

00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:39.710
Acts 28-15 tells us that,

00:29:39.710 --> 00:29:44.710
upon seeing them, Paul thanked God and took courage.

00:29:44.710 --> 00:29:48.710
Next, we come to the impressive ruins of Boston, Tika.

00:29:48.710 --> 00:29:51.710
This was Rome's most important port.

00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:56.710
It is about 25 kilometers or 16 miles southwest of Rome.

00:29:56.710 --> 00:29:59.710
We get a glimpse of Roman life back then

00:29:59.710 --> 00:30:03.710
with this multi-story apartment buildings known as Insule,

00:30:03.710 --> 00:30:08.710
along with temples, theatres, thermal baths, and shops.

00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:10.710
Walking through the old streets,

00:30:10.710 --> 00:30:13.710
it's easy to imagine our brothers witnessing to the people.

00:30:13.710 --> 00:30:17.710
Perhaps they stopped to eat at a food shop similar to this one,

00:30:17.710 --> 00:30:23.710
called Thermopolue, where you could buy bread, wine,

00:30:23.710 --> 00:30:28.710
roasted meat, cheese, and half-sum refreshment.

00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:31.710
Next, we arrive in Rome,

00:30:31.710 --> 00:30:34.710
where perhaps the most well-known monument stands.

00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:38.710
Yes, you guessed it, the Colosseum.

00:30:38.710 --> 00:30:43.710
The Mamoth structure was built in the first century CE,

00:30:43.710 --> 00:30:50.710
with a seating capacity estimated to be from 40,000 to 87,000 persons.

00:30:50.710 --> 00:30:53.710
This was Rome's entertainment center.

00:30:53.710 --> 00:30:57.710
There were mainly two types of games or exhibitions,

00:30:57.710 --> 00:31:02.710
combat between two gladiators and the hunting of wild animals.

00:31:02.710 --> 00:31:05.710
Criminals were also put to death here.

00:31:05.710 --> 00:31:09.710
Interestingly, entry to the Colosseum was free.

00:31:09.710 --> 00:31:12.710
This was part of the policy of the Amperors,

00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:16.710
who offered free entertainment in order to keep the people under control.

00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:22.710
In reality, these spectacles were like a drug that corrupted people's consciences.

00:31:22.710 --> 00:31:28.710
Through Christians back then, courageously refused to take any part as spectators.

00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:34.710
By the way, do you know where the Romans got the funds to build this huge stadium?

00:31:34.710 --> 00:31:38.710
It came from the conquest of Jerusalem in 70 CE.

00:31:38.710 --> 00:31:42.710
In fact, there is even an inscription at the Colosseum

00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:43.710
that reads,

00:31:43.710 --> 00:31:47.710
the Emperor, Titus, Caesar, Vespasian Augustus,

00:31:47.710 --> 00:31:51.710
ordered the new amphitheater to be made from the proceeds

00:31:51.710 --> 00:31:54.710
from the sale of the booty.

00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:56.710
To remember this important event,

00:31:56.710 --> 00:32:01.710
Emperor Domitian had a Trojan full arch built in honor of his brother Titus,

00:32:01.710 --> 00:32:04.710
who conquered Jerusalem and later became Emperor.

00:32:04.710 --> 00:32:08.710
If you look carefully, you can see a bus relift

00:32:08.710 --> 00:32:12.710
with a scene of Roman soldiers carrying the spoils from Jerusalem

00:32:12.710 --> 00:32:16.710
with a lampstand taken from Jehovah's Temple.

00:32:16.710 --> 00:32:20.710
The arch stands today as a clear fulfillment of Jesus' words

00:32:20.710 --> 00:32:24.710
about the destruction of Jerusalem and the temple.

00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:27.710
So you see, if we use the Bible as a map,

00:32:27.710 --> 00:32:30.710
even the stones can be silent witnesses

00:32:30.710 --> 00:32:33.710
that the Bible is a book of true history,

00:32:33.710 --> 00:32:37.710
true life, and true prophecies.

00:32:37.710 --> 00:32:47.240
I hope you enjoy the tour.

00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:50.240
Thank you for taking us on that wonderful tour, Marco.

00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:53.240
After seeing that video, we all want to go to Italy ourselves.

00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:56.240
Don't we see those sights in person?

00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:59.240
Be prepared.

00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:02.240
So, Manny, let's come back to you now.

00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:07.240
What has been the highlight of your Gilea training?

00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:09.240
You know, I wasn't raised in the truth.

00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:16.240
So as a teenager, I was interested in making sure I improved my situation

00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:19.240
by means of secular education.

00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:21.240
I thought education was the answer.

00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:23.240
I thought it was my ticket out.

00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:26.240
And boy, did Jehovah fool me?

00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:27.240
How so?

00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:32.240
Well, secular education wasn't the answer, but education was.

00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:38.240
Jehovah knew I needed the very best education, the vine education.

00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:43.240
And the truth is that what I've learned from our grand instructor, Jehovah,

00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:49.240
surpasses by far anything that the secular education could have provided me.

00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:54.240
It really helped me see that, in fact, the education that Jehovah provides us

00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:56.240
makes us better people.

00:33:56.240 --> 00:34:02.240
So in Gilea's school, I have been able to appreciate how Jehovah has continued to train us

00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:07.240
and provide us with something that's helpful not only to myself but to others.

00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:13.239
And honestly, I'm really grateful that I've had this opportunity to get better acquainted with my Heavenly Father.

00:34:13.239 --> 00:34:15.239
Well stated.

00:34:15.239 --> 00:34:18.239
Now tell us, final question to you.

00:34:18.239 --> 00:34:23.239
How do you plan on using in your assignment, which you've learned at Gilea?

00:34:23.239 --> 00:34:29.239
I would tend to steer or guide myself toward guidelines,

00:34:29.239 --> 00:34:34.239
but Gilea has taught me that while guidelines are important,

00:34:34.239 --> 00:34:39.239
I can't lose sight of what's more important to Jehovah, and that's people.

00:34:39.239 --> 00:34:40.239
Yes.

00:34:40.239 --> 00:34:42.239
And Jesus knew that, and He saw that.

00:34:42.239 --> 00:34:47.239
Therefore, I want to imitate Jesus in my dealings with people.

00:34:47.239 --> 00:34:51.239
When He was on earth, who knew the rules better than Jesus?

00:34:51.239 --> 00:34:53.239
Yet what was His focus?

00:34:53.239 --> 00:34:54.239
People.

00:34:54.239 --> 00:34:56.239
He put people first.

00:34:56.239 --> 00:34:57.239
He loved them.

00:34:57.239 --> 00:34:59.239
He didn't hold that against them.

00:34:59.239 --> 00:35:08.239
In my assignment, I hope to imitate Jesus fully in that I can balance guidelines with principles,

00:35:08.239 --> 00:35:12.239
but never losing sight of loving Jehovah's people.

00:35:12.239 --> 00:35:14.239
That's beautiful.

00:35:14.239 --> 00:35:15.239
Nice lesson learned.

00:35:15.239 --> 00:35:17.239
Thank you for sharing that.

00:35:17.239 --> 00:35:23.239
In fact, why don't we get an expression from the rest of you on those very same questions?

00:35:23.239 --> 00:35:25.239
How about you, Adalia?

00:35:25.239 --> 00:35:28.239
What has been the highlight of your Gilea training?

00:35:28.239 --> 00:35:35.239
To be honest with you, Brother Chilson, I came to Gilea very scared and apprehensive of the unknown.

00:35:35.239 --> 00:35:36.239
We understand.

00:35:36.239 --> 00:35:41.239
Not knowing what our future assignment might be was very unsettling to me.

00:35:41.239 --> 00:35:47.239
But after several lessons, I feel positive and better equipped for what the future holds for us.

00:35:47.239 --> 00:35:50.239
We did a deep dive into the sermon on the Mount.

00:35:50.239 --> 00:35:53.239
And one particular illustration touched me.

00:35:53.239 --> 00:35:55.239
Matthew 7 verse 9 and 10.

00:35:55.239 --> 00:36:01.239
Jesus asks which Father, when His Son asks for a fish, would hand Him a serpent.

00:36:01.239 --> 00:36:05.239
Now, His listeners understood that a fish could resemble a serpent,

00:36:05.239 --> 00:36:09.239
so that the illustration took on a little bit more meaning.

00:36:09.239 --> 00:36:15.239
Even though a Son could have been initially deceived if He received a serpent,

00:36:15.239 --> 00:36:17.239
a loving Father would never do such a thing.

00:36:17.239 --> 00:36:18.239
No.

00:36:18.239 --> 00:36:23.239
So I realize that my Heavenly Father, Jehovah, would never give me something bad

00:36:23.239 --> 00:36:25.239
and make it appear as something good.

00:36:25.239 --> 00:36:31.239
So after meditating on this, I realize that Jehovah will only give me something that will be beneficial for us.

00:36:31.239 --> 00:36:36.239
And whatever He asks, it will only be for my eternal happiness.

00:36:36.239 --> 00:36:38.239
Ah, that's beautiful.

00:36:38.239 --> 00:36:41.239
Yeah, we pray that you have success in that.

00:36:41.239 --> 00:36:50.239
In the final question for you, Adalia, how do you hope to use in your assignment what you've learned at Gilea?

00:36:50.239 --> 00:36:53.239
I know our brothers and sisters are going through a lot.

00:36:53.239 --> 00:36:56.239
I want to be able to help strengthen their faith.

00:36:56.239 --> 00:37:00.239
The way mine has been built by sharing with them things that I've learned in school

00:37:00.239 --> 00:37:04.239
and also just by living examples, being a living example for them.

00:37:04.239 --> 00:37:09.239
And also making sure that they understand whatever challenge or trial that they face,

00:37:09.239 --> 00:37:11.239
Jehovah will sustain them.

00:37:11.239 --> 00:37:13.239
There's no doubt about it.

00:37:13.239 --> 00:37:17.239
So with all that being said, I know that we're ready for whatever the future holds for us.

00:37:17.239 --> 00:37:23.239
And the way my faith has been strengthened, it's my treasure, my possession that I'm never going to let go of.

00:37:23.239 --> 00:37:25.239
Oh, that's beautiful.

00:37:25.239 --> 00:37:28.239
Thank you for sharing with us.

00:37:28.239 --> 00:37:31.239
Hanta, let's ask you that question.

00:37:31.239 --> 00:37:35.239
What has been the highlight of Gilea training for you?

00:37:35.239 --> 00:37:48.239
I've learned many times, I've read in our publications, many times that Jehovah never fails to reward his faithful ones.

00:37:48.239 --> 00:37:52.239
But Gilea helped me to understand that more fully.

00:37:52.239 --> 00:37:54.239
How do you mean?

00:37:55.239 --> 00:38:00.239
Jehovah used Nebuchadnezzar to conquer Tyre.

00:38:00.239 --> 00:38:10.239
But Nebuchadnezzar and his men did not get many things, many riches from Tyre.

00:38:10.239 --> 00:38:15.239
So it was as if Jehovah told him Nebuchadnezzar,

00:38:15.239 --> 00:38:20.239
thank you very much for your labor for me.

00:38:20.239 --> 00:38:24.239
Here I give you treasures from Egypt.

00:38:24.239 --> 00:38:34.239
Nebuchadnezzar was not his servant, but he rewarded him for the labor he did for him.

00:38:34.239 --> 00:38:41.239
So if Jehovah can't do that to someone who is not worshiping him,

00:38:41.239 --> 00:38:48.239
how much more so will he reward those who are loyal to him?

00:38:48.239 --> 00:38:50.239
Oh, what a beautiful lesson you learned.

00:38:50.239 --> 00:38:53.239
Thank you, thank you for sharing that.

00:38:53.239 --> 00:38:55.239
And final question to you, Hanta.

00:38:55.239 --> 00:39:02.239
How do you plan on using what you've learned in your assignment from what you've gathered here at Gilea?

00:39:02.239 --> 00:39:07.239
Yes, when a sister comes to me with her problem,

00:39:07.239 --> 00:39:13.239
I quickly think of a solution even when the sister is still speaking.

00:39:13.239 --> 00:39:20.239
But Gilea told me to listen, to show empathy.

00:39:20.239 --> 00:39:23.239
The person may not need a solution at all.

00:39:23.239 --> 00:39:26.239
Maybe what she needs is a listening ear.

00:39:26.239 --> 00:39:33.239
But when help is needed, I'm determined to use Bible principle to reason with the person

00:39:33.239 --> 00:39:37.239
and allow the person to draw the conclusion.

00:39:37.239 --> 00:39:41.239
So I allow the person to draw conclusion, that's all.

00:39:41.239 --> 00:39:43.239
We wish you success in that, Hanta.

00:39:43.239 --> 00:39:46.239
Thank you so much for sharing that with us.

00:39:46.239 --> 00:39:49.239
Now, Simon, let's go over to you.

00:39:49.239 --> 00:39:50.239
Okay.

00:39:50.239 --> 00:39:52.239
What has been the highlight of your Gilea training?

00:39:52.239 --> 00:40:00.239
For me, the growing spiritual course lessons have a huge impact.

00:40:00.239 --> 00:40:04.239
I even changed my prayer a little bit.

00:40:04.239 --> 00:40:08.239
For example, I used to pray to Jehovah,

00:40:08.239 --> 00:40:15.239
please help me to show love to my wife and friends and brothers and sisters.

00:40:15.239 --> 00:40:16.239
Good prayer.

00:40:16.239 --> 00:40:17.239
Yeah.

00:40:17.239 --> 00:40:20.239
But it's a little bit vague.

00:40:20.239 --> 00:40:26.239
But now I understand what love is specifically.

00:40:26.239 --> 00:40:33.239
Love is unselfish cruelty, focusing on doing good to others,

00:40:33.239 --> 00:40:42.239
regardless of the merit of the recipient or any benefit I could get back.

00:40:42.239 --> 00:40:49.239
So now I know that when I pray to Jehovah to show love,

00:40:49.239 --> 00:40:56.239
I am asking for help to be more unselfish person.

00:40:56.239 --> 00:40:58.239
Yeah, that's beautiful.

00:40:58.239 --> 00:41:00.239
That's a good lesson you've learned.

00:41:00.239 --> 00:41:04.239
Now tell us how do you plan on using in your assignment

00:41:04.239 --> 00:41:07.239
what you've gathered here at Gilea?

00:41:07.239 --> 00:41:09.239
Yeah.

00:41:09.239 --> 00:41:13.239
You know, brother Chilton, the Gilea training made me understand

00:41:13.239 --> 00:41:16.239
that why I loved computers so much.

00:41:16.239 --> 00:41:17.239
Okay.

00:41:17.239 --> 00:41:21.239
We have to know more of that.

00:41:21.239 --> 00:41:22.239
What do you mean?

00:41:22.239 --> 00:41:30.239
Because I can program the computers how they work and they will just work.

00:41:30.239 --> 00:41:34.239
But people are not like that.

00:41:34.239 --> 00:41:37.239
They are unpredictable.

00:41:37.239 --> 00:41:42.239
And they don't always do what I want them to do.

00:41:44.489 --> 00:41:48.489
So because of this, when I am focusing on something technical thing,

00:41:48.489 --> 00:41:53.489
it is not always easy for me to switch my mind to love people.

00:41:53.489 --> 00:41:58.489
So my goal is to love people the way Jehovah loves them.

00:41:58.489 --> 00:42:02.489
Remembering they are doing their best as I am.

00:42:02.489 --> 00:42:04.489
Good lesson learned.

00:42:04.489 --> 00:42:07.489
Thank you for sharing that with us.

00:42:07.489 --> 00:42:09.489
Let's talk to your wife now, Yoshi.

00:42:09.489 --> 00:42:13.489
What has been the highlight of your Gilea training?

00:42:13.489 --> 00:42:14.489
Yeah.

00:42:14.489 --> 00:42:19.489
Well, I'm seeing the fruitage of the spirit in a way that I never thought of before.

00:42:19.489 --> 00:42:21.489
Can I give you an example?

00:42:21.489 --> 00:42:22.489
Please.

00:42:22.489 --> 00:42:23.489
Yeah.

00:42:23.489 --> 00:42:29.489
So our culture is generally viewed as being humble and polite.

00:42:29.489 --> 00:42:36.489
Gilea has taught me that that kind of humility though is not a result of the Holy Spirit

00:42:36.489 --> 00:42:39.489
or a fruitage of the Holy Spirit.

00:42:39.489 --> 00:42:45.489
Gilea has taught me that humility, love, kindness, all those good qualities.

00:42:45.489 --> 00:42:53.489
They have to come from much, much deeper down, not culture or your natural tendency or personality.

00:42:53.489 --> 00:43:01.489
It has to be driven by Jehovah, by his Holy Spirit, for it to be a fruitage of the Holy Spirit.

00:43:01.489 --> 00:43:08.489
And that understanding of Jehovah helping us in our good points, that just really blew my mind.

00:43:08.489 --> 00:43:09.489
Okay.

00:43:09.489 --> 00:43:11.489
Nice.

00:43:11.489 --> 00:43:16.489
So how do you plan on using in your assignment when you've learned that Gilea at Yoshi?

00:43:16.489 --> 00:43:17.489
Yes.

00:43:17.489 --> 00:43:20.489
So the Holy Spirit power is very strong.

00:43:20.489 --> 00:43:28.489
So my goal is when I get to my new assignment is to be able to expand my comfort zone

00:43:28.489 --> 00:43:34.489
by denial with Jehovah's help so that I can be more people oriented.

00:43:34.489 --> 00:43:40.489
And I can be comfortable with people and I hope they'll be comfortable with me too.

00:43:40.489 --> 00:43:43.489
We have every confidence that they will be.

00:43:43.489 --> 00:43:45.489
Well done Yoshi, thank you.

00:43:45.489 --> 00:43:46.489
Thank you.

00:43:46.489 --> 00:43:51.489
Now finally, Marco, you're our last one here.

00:43:51.489 --> 00:43:55.489
So what has been the highlight of your Gilea training?

00:43:55.489 --> 00:44:00.489
I think that Gilea helped me to love the Bible even more.

00:44:00.489 --> 00:44:08.489
I realized that digging into it, the more I studied the Bible, the more I found new things to learn that I didn't imagine.

00:44:08.489 --> 00:44:18.489
And I could compare the Bible now to a suitcase with a double or triple bottom layer and full of things.

00:44:19.489 --> 00:44:26.489
And because the more I look into it, the more I can take out more things that maybe I didn't see at the beginning.

00:44:26.489 --> 00:44:38.489
So the lesson for me is that when I studied the Bible, I should slow down, take my time to meditate, find a different angle, study all the aspects.

00:44:38.489 --> 00:44:43.489
Because nothing in the Bible is random or written by chance.

00:44:44.489 --> 00:44:46.489
Nice, nice lesson you've learned there.

00:44:46.489 --> 00:44:50.489
And how do you plan on using in your assignment what you've learned?

00:44:50.489 --> 00:44:55.489
I think to be aware of how rich is the Bible will help me in any assignment.

00:44:55.489 --> 00:45:04.489
I'm more convinced that in any circumstances I will face in the future, new circumstances could be challenging or unexpected.

00:45:04.489 --> 00:45:12.489
I think that the only thing I have to do is to go back to the Bible and look for a similar situation

00:45:12.489 --> 00:45:15.489
or a lesson or a Bible principle that can apply.

00:45:15.489 --> 00:45:22.489
Because I'm sure that Jehovah has a loving Father, has already written in the Bible everything that I need.

00:45:22.489 --> 00:45:26.489
Excellent, well done and we'll pray for your success in that too, Marko.

00:45:26.489 --> 00:45:35.489
Well, we have thoroughly enjoyed getting to know the six of you better and we appreciate so much you sharing with us your personal expressions.

00:45:36.489 --> 00:45:42.489
We echo the words of the Apostle Paul written at 2 Timothy chapter 4 verse 22,

00:45:42.489 --> 00:45:51.489
when he said, the Lord, be with the Spirit you show, his undeserved kindness be with you.

00:45:51.489 --> 00:46:00.489
It is our prayer that Jehovah's rich blessing continue upon you six and the rest of your Gilead Class 156.

00:46:00.489 --> 00:46:06.489
And to all of you in our viewing audience, thank you for joining us.

00:46:06.489 --> 00:46:11.489
We look forward to being with you again on the next edition of the Inside Story.

00:46:11.489 --> 00:46:45.159
We look forward to hearing from Brother Garrett Loesch today for this principle talk where the Loesch is our longest serving member of the governing body.

00:46:45.159 --> 00:46:49.159
In fact, just recently made 30 years serving on the governing body.

00:46:49.159 --> 00:46:56.159
So we look forward to his fine talk. I think you'll appreciate the simplicity and power of his theme.

00:46:56.159 --> 00:46:59.159
It is trust in Jehovah.

00:46:59.159 --> 00:47:07.909
In God we trust. It says on U.S. dollar bills.

00:47:07.909 --> 00:47:17.909
However, according to the actual attitude of the people, she did not rather say, in money we trust.

00:47:17.909 --> 00:47:22.909
However, trusting in money or riches will lead to disappointment.

00:47:22.909 --> 00:47:29.909
Proverbs 11, 28 says, one trusting in riches will fail.

00:47:29.909 --> 00:47:34.909
As Jehovah's Witnesses, we say, in Jehovah we trust.

00:47:34.909 --> 00:47:39.380
Therefore, we will not fail.

00:47:39.380 --> 00:47:42.380
There's many reasons to trust Jehovah.

00:47:42.380 --> 00:47:46.380
We are all impressed by Jehovah's works, aren't we?

00:47:46.380 --> 00:47:48.380
This includes nature.

00:47:48.380 --> 00:47:56.380
And we are impressed when we look at majestic mountains, when we admire the beauty of flowers.

00:47:56.380 --> 00:48:00.380
There are so many different flowers in the world.

00:48:00.380 --> 00:48:03.380
Which one do you like best?

00:48:03.380 --> 00:48:11.940
Man can make artificial flowers, but not real ones that reproduce.

00:48:11.940 --> 00:48:16.940
Man can make a beautiful jewelry or other works of art.

00:48:16.940 --> 00:48:23.940
However, man cannot produce or make a single stem of grass.

00:48:23.940 --> 00:48:26.940
Not to speak of flowers or trees.

00:48:26.940 --> 00:48:31.940
Should reflection on this not make us humble?

00:48:31.940 --> 00:48:35.940
Man cannot create any living thing.

00:48:35.940 --> 00:48:39.940
But Jehovah can and did so.

00:48:39.940 --> 00:48:46.940
Jesus commanded, or in connection with Matthew 6, 29.

00:48:46.940 --> 00:48:53.940
And he said also, in this verse, take a lesson from the lilies of the field, how they grow.

00:48:53.940 --> 00:48:56.940
They do not toil, they do not spin.

00:48:56.940 --> 00:49:04.579
But I tell you that not even Solomon in all his glory was arrayed as one of these.

00:49:04.579 --> 00:49:10.579
Yes, Jehovah is the Almighty and he created nature and man.

00:49:10.579 --> 00:49:16.579
He did not need to create nature and us in order for him to be happy.

00:49:16.579 --> 00:49:26.579
He existed before he started to create for an unknown length of time, as we understand time.

00:49:26.579 --> 00:49:30.579
Since when does Jehovah exist?

00:49:30.579 --> 00:49:32.579
He always existed.

00:49:32.579 --> 00:49:35.579
How can we understand this?

00:49:35.579 --> 00:49:42.579
Suppose there was a time when Jehovah did not exist yet.

00:49:42.579 --> 00:49:46.579
Then nothing would exist now.

00:49:46.579 --> 00:49:51.579
Why? Because nothing can come from nothing.

00:49:51.579 --> 00:49:57.579
The fact that we exist is proof that Jehovah always existed.

00:49:57.579 --> 00:50:00.579
It's that simple.

00:50:00.579 --> 00:50:04.579
Before Jehovah started to create, he existed all alone.

00:50:04.579 --> 00:50:07.579
But he did not feel lonely, did he?

00:50:07.579 --> 00:50:13.579
He does not depend on others or on things to feel happy.

00:50:13.579 --> 00:50:18.579
The Bible says, first Timothy 1, 10, he is the happy God.

00:50:18.579 --> 00:50:29.579
Jehovah exists from time indefinite to time indefinite and has complete knowledge of the universal history.

00:50:29.579 --> 00:50:38.579
Psalm 90 verse 1 and 2 says, oh Jehovah, from everlasting to everlasting, you are God.

00:50:38.579 --> 00:50:42.579
Jehovah created the universe, the earth and man.

00:50:42.579 --> 00:50:50.579
He desired to let others share intelligent life and self-awareness out of love.

00:50:50.579 --> 00:50:56.579
It's not that he needed other creatures to feel happy.

00:50:56.579 --> 00:51:01.579
Or he didn't also need material things to feel happy.

00:51:01.579 --> 00:51:07.579
He was happy since past eternity before creation.

00:51:07.579 --> 00:51:14.579
How loving that he created mankind so that we can enjoy life and friendship with him.

00:51:14.579 --> 00:51:20.579
And what an expression of his all-mightiness, his wisdom and love.

00:51:20.579 --> 00:51:25.579
It impresses on our mind and heart how great Jehovah is.

00:51:25.579 --> 00:51:36.579
When we encounter challenges in our everyday lives, meditating on Jehovah will help us to endure challenges and difficulties of all sorts.

00:51:36.579 --> 00:51:49.579
And to trust him, you soon to be gladiates will find this to be true when you are confronted with problems in the future.

00:51:49.579 --> 00:51:59.579
If you experience problems, then what? Pray to Jehovah. His ability to hear prayers is mind-boggling.

00:51:59.579 --> 00:52:13.019
Is it not so that when we pray, we have the feeling that Jehovah at that moment has nothing else in mind or to do than just listen to us?

00:52:14.019 --> 00:52:27.019
But he can listen to tens of thousands of prayers in hundreds of languages all at the same time.

00:52:27.019 --> 00:52:38.019
This includes prayers which are not presented audibly, but silent prayers also spoken in our heart and our mind.

00:52:38.019 --> 00:52:45.019
How awesome. This really strengthens our trust and faith in him, doesn't it?

00:52:45.019 --> 00:52:54.300
The universe also, that Jehovah created, strengthens our trust in him.

00:52:54.300 --> 00:53:06.300
We feel really small and insignificant when we think that the universe got started about as scientists say 18 to 20 billion years ago.

00:53:07.300 --> 00:53:28.300
Let us consider a few facts or from connection with the universe that expands, comments that were made about galaxies that move into empty space, empty space where no galaxies or stars yet.

00:53:28.300 --> 00:53:39.300
Even with the newest telescopes, scientists have not reached the border of the physical universe, behind which there is nothing, just empty space.

00:53:39.300 --> 00:53:52.980
It is mind-boggling to meditate on the universe. Looking at the starry heaven at night, have you ever wondered how far out into space you are actually peering?

00:53:52.980 --> 00:54:02.980
Or how many stars you can see with your naked eye? In Psalm 8, verse 3 and 4, David wrote about looking at the stars.

00:54:02.980 --> 00:54:15.980
He said, when I see your heavens, the works of your fingers, the moon and the stars that you have prepared, what is mortal man that you keep in mind and the son of man that you take care of him?

00:54:15.980 --> 00:54:27.980
It really can make us feel humble to meditate on the universe. How far into the universe could David and also we peer?

00:54:28.980 --> 00:54:46.980
At a distance of some 600,000 light years, according to a Watchtower in 1983, it is estimated that our Milky Way alone contains 200 to 400 billion stars.

00:54:46.980 --> 00:55:01.980
The stars move with fantastic speed. The Encyclopedia says, quote, the speed of our solar system circulating in our galaxies is about 220 kilometers per second.

00:55:01.980 --> 00:55:13.980
And as scientists found out at the speed of 568,000 miles per hour, end of quote.

00:55:13.980 --> 00:55:24.980
It is estimated that a light beam takes about 100,000 years from one end of our Milky Way to the other end.

00:55:24.980 --> 00:55:37.980
If we look at our Milky Way from outside, our Milky Way and from a different angle, we would see it like a disk.

00:55:37.980 --> 00:55:46.980
But we see it as a way, due to the location of our solar system and the outskirts of the Milky Way.

00:55:46.980 --> 00:56:04.980
In the book Guide to the Galaxy, published in 1994, it says that it takes the solar system 240 million years to complete the grand circuit around the galaxy.

00:56:04.980 --> 00:56:11.980
This speed is an absolute speed, end of quote.

00:56:11.980 --> 00:56:22.980
Astronomers estimate that there are approximately 100 billion to one trillion galaxies in the universe.

00:56:22.980 --> 00:56:32.980
But how many stars? It is estimated between 10, 6,000,000 and 1,7,000,000, if it means something to you.

00:56:32.980 --> 00:56:48.739
You may wonder what is 1,7,000,000? Well, it is, as we can see, illustrated one with 24 zeros.

00:56:48.739 --> 00:57:00.739
That is, if you take 1 billion and you multiply that by 1,4,000,000, next picture shows, you get 1,7,000,000.

00:57:00.739 --> 00:57:09.739
Can you follow? It is hard for me. The watchtower of March 1, 1991 raised the question,

00:57:09.739 --> 00:57:21.739
quote, where is the source of all the energy represented by the 100,000 million stars in our galaxy, and it is just one galaxy,

00:57:21.739 --> 00:57:33.739
as well as the more than 1,000 million galaxies that make up the visible universe, the quote from 1991, watchtower March 1.

00:57:33.739 --> 00:57:42.739
The Bible encourages us to meditate on the universe. It strengthens our trust into hover.

00:57:42.739 --> 00:57:50.739
The Bible says, raise your eyes high up and see, who has created these things?

00:57:50.739 --> 00:57:57.739
It is the one who is bringing forth the army of them even by number, all of whom he calls even by name.

00:57:57.739 --> 00:58:05.739
Due to the abundance of dynamic energy, he also being vigorous in power, not one of them is missing.

00:58:05.739 --> 00:58:10.739
Well, who is that one? Of course, Jehovah.

00:58:10.739 --> 00:58:17.739
Why is it good to talk about the universe since it is so hard to fathom its size?

00:58:17.739 --> 00:58:31.739
The universe proves that Jehovah is Almighty, and this inspires us to trust in his prophecies about putting an end to wickedness,

00:58:31.739 --> 00:58:38.739
putting an end to the devil, and creating a paradise on earth for all obedient mankind.

00:58:38.739 --> 00:58:47.739
It is good to reflect on what David wrote about Jehovah in Psalm 139.

00:58:47.739 --> 00:58:57.739
In verses 1 to 5, David is confident of Jehovah's interest in him.

00:58:57.739 --> 00:59:05.739
Jehovah wants but to hear from us. We can share our innermost thoughts.

00:59:05.739 --> 00:59:09.739
We can tell Jehovah anything without being embarrassed.

00:59:09.739 --> 00:59:23.699
So let's look at the scripture, Psalm 139 from verse 1.

00:59:23.699 --> 00:59:31.699
Oh, Jehovah, you have searched through me and you know me. You know when I sit down and when I rise up,

00:59:31.699 --> 00:59:39.699
you discern my thoughts from afar. You observe me when I travel and when I lay down.

00:59:39.699 --> 00:59:47.699
You are familiar with all my ways. There's not a word on my tongue, but look, Jehovah, you already know it well.

00:59:48.699 --> 00:59:56.400
Behind and before me, you surround me and you lay your hand upon me.

00:59:56.400 --> 01:00:01.400
So that's a very impressive text, isn't it?

01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:07.400
In verses 6 to 13, David tried to comprehend Jehovah's greatness.

01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:14.650
It was too much for him, and so in verse 6, he goes on to say,

01:00:14.650 --> 01:00:20.650
knowledge is beyond my comprehension. It is too high for me to reach.

01:00:20.650 --> 01:00:25.650
Where can I escape from your spirit and where can I run away from your face?

01:00:25.650 --> 01:00:29.650
If I were to ascend to heaven, you would be there.

01:00:29.650 --> 01:00:35.650
And if I were to make my bed in the grave, look, you would be there.

01:00:35.650 --> 01:00:42.650
If I would fly away with the wings of the dawn to reside by the most remote sea,

01:00:42.650 --> 01:00:48.650
even there, your hand would lead me and your right hand would take hold of me.

01:00:48.650 --> 01:00:53.650
If I say, surely darkness will conceal me, then the night around me would become light.

01:00:53.650 --> 01:01:00.650
Even the darkness would not be too dark for you, but night would be as bright as the day.

01:01:00.650 --> 01:01:05.650
Darkness is the same as light for you.

01:01:05.650 --> 01:01:10.650
For you produced my kidneys, you kept me screened off in my mother's womb.

01:01:12.989 --> 01:01:17.989
David is amazed at Jehovah's wisdom in creating a human body.

01:01:17.989 --> 01:01:23.989
He gives all credit to Jehovah for his extraordinary gift.

01:01:23.989 --> 01:01:26.989
Verse 14 continues to say,

01:01:26.989 --> 01:01:32.989
I praise you, because in an awe-inspiring way, I am wonderfully made.

01:01:32.989 --> 01:01:37.989
Your works are wonderful, and I know this very well.

01:01:38.989 --> 01:01:43.989
My bones were not hidden from you when I was made in secret,

01:01:43.989 --> 01:01:47.989
when I was woven in the depth of the earth, figuratively.

01:01:47.989 --> 01:01:50.989
Your eyes even saw me as an embryo.

01:01:50.989 --> 01:01:55.989
All its parts were written in your book, regarding the days when they were formed,

01:01:55.989 --> 01:01:59.989
before any of them existed.

01:01:59.989 --> 01:02:04.989
So let's read two more verses and see the effect it had on David

01:02:04.989 --> 01:02:12.989
and his complete trust and confidence in his Heavenly Father, verse 17.

01:02:12.989 --> 01:02:19.989
So to me, how precious your thoughts are, O God, how vast is the sum of them?

01:02:19.989 --> 01:02:26.989
If I try to count them, they outnumber the grains of sand.

01:02:26.989 --> 01:02:31.989
When I awake, I am still with you.

01:02:31.989 --> 01:02:40.989
So we agree with David that we are created in a wonderful way, very impressive.

01:02:40.989 --> 01:02:49.989
Well, think of as an example of our ability to use language and thought.

01:02:49.989 --> 01:02:55.989
We are also unique in our profound curiosity about ourselves, aren't we?

01:02:55.989 --> 01:03:02.989
Different from all animals, we are unique in our ability to contemplate God's thoughts.

01:03:02.989 --> 01:03:07.989
This is one way we are made in God's image.

01:03:07.989 --> 01:03:18.989
Think of our eyes, a marvel, we have binocular vision, able to distinguish the relationship between different objects.

01:03:18.989 --> 01:03:24.989
Think of our ears, a marvel, we hear in stereo.

01:03:24.989 --> 01:03:30.880
Now let's talk about the universe in our brain.

01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:36.880
The book, the physics fact book, edited by Glenn Ellert says in the quote,

01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:46.880
weighing around three pounds, the brain contains nearly 100 billion neurons.

01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:49.880
What's that, nerve cells?

01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:53.880
100 billion neurons.

01:03:53.880 --> 01:04:00.860
If you don't believe them, you can verify count yourself here.

01:04:00.860 --> 01:04:05.860
The brain is the most complicated organ in the universe.

01:04:05.860 --> 01:04:16.139
One reference works as about these nerve cells that are as many as the stars in the Milky Way galaxy.

01:04:16.139 --> 01:04:22.139
It also has trillions of supportive cells called glia.

01:04:22.139 --> 01:04:36.139
Each neuron is connected to other neurons by as many as 40,000 individual connections called synapses between the cells.

01:04:36.139 --> 01:04:46.139
The brain has more connections than there are stars in the universe, end of quote.

01:04:46.139 --> 01:04:53.139
The question, we are wonderfully made, and all the praise belongs to Jehovah.

01:04:53.139 --> 01:04:59.139
Being aware that Jehovah created this fantastic universe, the earth and man,

01:04:59.139 --> 01:05:05.139
does this not help us to become more confident in our trust in Jehovah,

01:05:05.139 --> 01:05:11.139
to be able and willing to help us when we face problems or challenges?

01:05:11.139 --> 01:05:18.139
Should we face persecution or abandon on our work, then what?

01:05:18.139 --> 01:05:21.139
Trust in Jehovah.

01:05:21.139 --> 01:05:25.139
But Jehovah is not only all-powerful.

01:05:25.139 --> 01:05:28.139
He is also love, personified.

01:05:28.139 --> 01:05:32.139
Jehovah is very interested in you soon to be Gilead graduates.

01:05:32.139 --> 01:05:35.139
Yes, he is interested in all of us.

01:05:35.139 --> 01:05:36.139
He loves us.

01:05:36.139 --> 01:05:41.139
He gave his beloved son Jesus Christ as a sacrifice for our sins,

01:05:41.139 --> 01:05:48.139
and for the purpose of helping us to become perfect and enjoy everlasting friendship with him.

01:05:48.139 --> 01:05:54.139
Jehovah had full trust and confidence in his son's faithfulness.

01:05:54.139 --> 01:05:58.139
His love moves us to love.

01:05:58.139 --> 01:06:03.139
Love is the perfect bond of union, says Colossians 3.14.

01:06:03.139 --> 01:06:07.139
Yes, it is the most powerful bond in the universe.

01:06:07.139 --> 01:06:14.139
Perfect love bonding the son and the father together unbreakably.

01:06:14.139 --> 01:06:18.139
For like reasons God trusts His organizational servants,

01:06:18.139 --> 01:06:25.139
knowing that love would hold most of them immovably under test.

01:06:25.139 --> 01:06:28.139
Some 56 verse 11 says,

01:06:28.139 --> 01:06:32.139
In God we have put out trust.

01:06:32.139 --> 01:06:35.139
Some 3 verse 5 encourages us.

01:06:35.139 --> 01:06:39.139
Trust in Jehovah with all your heart.

01:06:39.139 --> 01:06:42.139
Jesus is our best example.

01:06:42.139 --> 01:06:46.139
When he was nailed to the torture stake, his enemies mockingly said,

01:06:46.139 --> 01:06:49.139
He has put his trust in God.

01:06:49.139 --> 01:06:55.610
Let him now rescue him if he wants him for he said, I'm God's son.

01:06:55.610 --> 01:07:00.610
On the other hand, Jehovah trusts us as well.

01:07:00.610 --> 01:07:02.610
How encouraging.

01:07:02.610 --> 01:07:12.610
He trusts his organization of servants, knowing that love would hold most of them or most of us immovably to him.

01:07:12.610 --> 01:07:16.610
Immovably under test.

01:07:16.610 --> 01:07:24.610
And that his organization of creatures would never stop doing so.

01:07:24.610 --> 01:07:29.610
He trusted Abraham. He trusted other patriarchs.

01:07:29.610 --> 01:07:32.610
He trusts the anointed ones today.

01:07:32.610 --> 01:07:37.610
He trusts the members of the great crowd with an earthly hope.

01:07:37.610 --> 01:07:42.610
Yes, Jehovah trusts you.

01:07:42.610 --> 01:07:49.610
And we trust that you all will continue to trust Jehovah forever.

01:07:49.610 --> 01:08:00.159
Yes, in God we trust.

01:08:00.159 --> 01:08:04.159
Now we come to our presentation of the diplomas.

01:08:04.159 --> 01:08:08.159
And so for this, I will be assisted by Brother Melanfant,

01:08:08.159 --> 01:08:10.159
a teaching, a helper to the teaching committee.

01:08:10.159 --> 01:08:12.159
So appreciate your help.

01:08:12.159 --> 01:08:13.159
Young man.

01:08:13.159 --> 01:08:16.079
Yes, thank you.

01:08:16.079 --> 01:08:19.079

Brother and Sister Wechakshana will return to the Indonesia branch.

01:13:10.859 --> 01:13:24.630
I think Brother Malen font did a fantastic job.

01:13:24.630 --> 01:13:53.489
But now it's my pleasure to present to you the graduates of the 156th class of Gillian.

01:13:53.489 --> 01:13:56.529
Well, the class has written a letter that they would like to read.

01:13:56.529 --> 01:14:10.460
And so for the Lewis Walker from the United States, we'll read that for us now.

01:14:10.460 --> 01:14:15.380
To the governing body and Bethel family.

01:14:15.380 --> 01:14:18.859
After five months of intense Bible study,

01:14:18.859 --> 01:14:22.100
we are filled with so many emotions

01:14:22.100 --> 01:14:27.739
that is hard to find the words to express our appreciation and gratitude.

01:14:27.739 --> 01:14:35.180
We feel like Isaiah when he saw a vision of Jehovah's described in Isaiah chapter six.

01:14:35.180 --> 01:14:39.260
He saw Jehovah in a way he never had before.

01:14:39.260 --> 01:14:42.140
And the same is true of us.

01:14:42.140 --> 01:14:49.100
Gillian has helped us to more deeply appreciate Jehovah's beautiful personality,

01:14:49.100 --> 01:14:54.260
his matchless wisdom and his unfailing love.

01:14:54.260 --> 01:15:00.979
Like Isaiah at times, we felt overwhelmed with our imperfections and limitations.

01:15:00.979 --> 01:15:06.819
However, just as Jehovah reassured Isaiah through a Seraph,

01:15:06.819 --> 01:15:13.060
Jehovah lovingly encouraged us during the past 20 weeks,

01:15:13.100 --> 01:15:20.140
we were cared for as a nursing mother tenderly cares for own children.

01:15:20.140 --> 01:15:26.340
Our structures became beloved to us as they shared not only their knowledge

01:15:26.340 --> 01:15:31.260
and understanding of God's word, but their very selves.

01:15:31.260 --> 01:15:40.539
We were encouraged to always give Jehovah our best to lower ourselves and to lift others up.

01:15:40.539 --> 01:15:49.300
We learned the value of not taking ourselves too seriously and to cherish our journey with Jehovah.

01:15:49.300 --> 01:15:54.859
We also deeply appreciate our dear governing body.

01:15:54.859 --> 01:16:01.060
Despite your very busy schedules, you may time for us,

01:16:01.060 --> 01:16:06.460
your heartfelt lectures motivated us to be courageous

01:16:06.500 --> 01:16:10.500
and to not fear the challenges we will face.

01:16:10.500 --> 01:16:18.100
We will never forget your example of kindness, humility, and love.

01:16:18.100 --> 01:16:26.140
And imitating your faith, we are determined to remain loyal and submissive to Jehovah

01:16:26.140 --> 01:16:31.260
in his organization as we go out to our assignments.

01:16:31.300 --> 01:16:36.819
Finally, our education went beyond the Gilea classroom.

01:16:36.819 --> 01:16:44.899
We saw hospitality defined by you dear brothers and sisters of the United States Bethel family.

01:16:44.899 --> 01:16:50.220
Your kindness and generosity were outstanding.

01:16:50.220 --> 01:16:53.859
We were simply basking in your love.

01:16:53.859 --> 01:16:58.140
And although we did not have the enough time to get to know each one of you,

01:16:58.180 --> 01:17:02.859
it was enough time to fall in love with you.

01:17:02.859 --> 01:17:10.699
We would never be able to thank our Heavenly Father enough for this unique experience.

01:17:10.699 --> 01:17:22.829
We now echo the words of Isaiah who declared even before receiving details of his new assignment.

01:17:22.869 --> 01:17:26.829
Here I am, send me, send me.

01:17:26.829 --> 01:17:34.750
As we depart for our respective assignments, we are confident thanks to this beautiful training

01:17:34.750 --> 01:17:40.630
that Jehovah will make us firm and he will make us strong.

01:17:40.630 --> 01:18:23.109
With heart's full of gratitude and love, your brothers, the 156 class of Gilea.

01:18:23.149 --> 01:18:25.270
We thank you for those sentiments.

01:18:25.270 --> 01:18:31.149
It truly does reflect the appreciation and spirituality of the entire class.

01:18:31.149 --> 01:18:35.310
So we appreciate that very much and what a pleasure to be with you today.

01:18:35.310 --> 01:18:42.029
Well, in our opening comments, we talked a bit about the privilege of being ones that Jehovah would use.

01:18:42.029 --> 01:18:47.430
And remember, we reviewed examples from Luke 1 and 2 of humble, obedient ones

01:18:47.430 --> 01:18:53.630
that Jehovah appreciated like Mary and the humble shepherds, Simeon and Anna.

01:18:53.630 --> 01:19:01.829
And the encouragement was imitate those fine examples and be the kind of people that Jehovah is pleased to use

01:19:01.829 --> 01:19:05.829
by cultivating what matters most to Jehovah.

01:19:05.829 --> 01:19:13.340
And that is spiritual qualities that he holds dear and that makes us useful to him.

01:19:13.340 --> 01:19:19.699
But the fact is, you are ones that Jehovah is pleased to use.

01:19:19.699 --> 01:19:25.779
In fact, all of Jehovah's people, all in the listening audience, all of Jehovah's people, the world over,

01:19:25.779 --> 01:19:29.100
Jehovah is pleased to use them because he is drawn each one.

01:19:29.100 --> 01:19:32.460
We know that, don't we? John 644 tells us, what does the verse say?

01:19:32.460 --> 01:19:38.659
That no man can come to me unless the father who sent me draws him and I will resurrect him in the last days.

01:19:38.699 --> 01:19:45.979
So Jehovah has drawn each one of us because he saw something in our hearts of value.

01:19:45.979 --> 01:19:53.819
He saw a humility and honesty and a desire to learn the truth and to serve the true and living God.

01:19:53.819 --> 01:20:00.500
And so we have the privilege then of being a part of Jehovah's name people.

01:20:00.500 --> 01:20:06.060
As individuals, we have the privilege of having a place in his great spiritual temple arrangement.

01:20:06.060 --> 01:20:09.500
We are all on Jehovah's team.

01:20:09.500 --> 01:20:17.079
And the privilege that every one of us has, of course, is to bear his name in the kingdom preaching work.

01:20:17.079 --> 01:20:23.319
But at times, Jehovah also gives us other work to do and other assignments that are related to the kingdom preaching work.

01:20:23.319 --> 01:20:29.800
And for you, dear friends, that included providing this training in Gilead.

01:20:29.800 --> 01:20:34.560
And while this Gilead training doesn't place you above your brothers and you certainly do not feel that way,

01:20:34.560 --> 01:20:41.439
it does indicate to Jehovah's approval of you and the fact that he saw something good in your hearts

01:20:41.439 --> 01:20:49.399
that he could then continue to mold and train so that he could use you to further help and strengthen his people.

01:20:49.399 --> 01:20:56.119
And quite likely it's some of the same things that he saw in Mary and the shepherds in Simeon and Anna.

01:20:56.119 --> 01:21:00.119
Humility, deep spirituality, obedience, loyalty,

01:21:00.119 --> 01:21:06.720
appreciation for spiritual things and constancy in your theocratic routine.

01:21:06.720 --> 01:21:18.199
Be assured that Jehovah loves you and that he approves of you for these valuable qualities that really make you useful to him.

01:21:18.199 --> 01:21:26.159
And so our concluding encouragement is keep being the kind of people that Jehovah can use.

01:21:26.159 --> 01:21:29.720
Really, that's at the heart of the encouragement in Philippians 316.

01:21:29.720 --> 01:21:36.800
At any rate to the extent we have made progress, let us go on walking orderly in the same routine.

01:21:36.800 --> 01:21:39.520
And we think back to our examples from Luke 1 and 2.

01:21:39.520 --> 01:21:46.119
And we don't hear again about Simeon and Anna, although we are sure that they remain faithful for the rest of their lives.

01:21:46.119 --> 01:21:54.479
But we do follow Mary as she continued in her service to Jehovah and the years go by as she raised Jesus,

01:21:54.479 --> 01:21:58.880
along with Joseph and her other children who loved and served Jehovah.

01:21:58.880 --> 01:22:10.359
We watched as Mary appreciatively preserved these things in her heart that Jehovah was doing in connection with her son and his son, of course, Jehovah.

01:22:10.359 --> 01:22:17.880
And we also follow Mary as she possibly dealt with the death of her husband at some point along the way.

01:22:17.880 --> 01:22:24.279
And as she dealt with the initial lack of faith of her other children in Jesus Messiah's ship.

01:22:24.279 --> 01:22:31.399
And then finally, as she watched her son die in a most shameful and painful way on that torture state,

01:22:31.399 --> 01:22:37.800
when Simeon's words came true that a long sword would be run through her.

01:22:37.800 --> 01:22:40.880
Jehovah's confidence in Mary was well placed.

01:22:40.880 --> 01:22:45.439
She continued to be the kind of person that he could use.

01:22:45.439 --> 01:22:50.680
And so follow her good example by being one that Jehovah can continue to use,

01:22:50.680 --> 01:22:53.680
by focusing on what matters most to Jehovah.

01:22:53.680 --> 01:22:58.840
Keep cultivating the qualities that will endear you to Jehovah.

01:22:58.840 --> 01:23:04.439
And then whatever work needs to be done, whatever assignment needs to be filled,

01:23:04.439 --> 01:23:07.319
whatever encouragement needs to be given.

01:23:07.319 --> 01:23:14.680
Well, then you will be spiritually qualified and you will be ready to be used by Jehovah if that is his desire.

01:23:14.680 --> 01:23:18.800
As continue to be one that Jehovah would use in his service.

01:23:18.800 --> 01:23:27.199
And then you will always have his favor and you will have joy and contentment in whatever Jehovah has in mind for you to do.

01:23:27.199 --> 01:23:31.800
We hope you enjoyed this portion of the graduation.

01:23:31.800 --> 01:23:40.079
Be on the lookout for the rest of the program as it's released on JW.org during this month.

01:23:40.079 --> 01:23:45.920
To conclude, our postcard takes us to the southern tip of Africa.

01:23:45.920 --> 01:23:49.279
Welcome to Eswatini.

01:23:49.279 --> 01:23:59.079
This tiny landlocked country, once known as Swaziland, sits between Mozambique and South Africa.

01:23:59.079 --> 01:24:05.359
You can find magnificent wildlife in Shalane National Park.

01:24:05.359 --> 01:24:09.560
Or stand in amazement beside Cebebe Rock.

01:24:09.560 --> 01:24:13.600
One of the world's largest granite domes.

01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:18.960
Tradition has an important place in Eswatini culture.

01:24:18.960 --> 01:24:28.359
How men or women tie Leah fabric over their shoulders communicates whether they are married or single.

01:24:28.359 --> 01:24:34.760
The country also has kept the tradition of an absolute monarchy.

01:24:34.760 --> 01:24:47.159
King Subuza, the second, rained for 82 years until his death in 1982 and had quite the rapport with Jehovah's Witnesses.

01:24:47.159 --> 01:25:00.760
In 1933, the king was delighted with the message carried by pioneers and called his personal bodyguard of 100 warriors to listen as well.

01:25:00.760 --> 01:25:09.239
On another occasion, he offered to buy the loudspeaker and the records our brothers were using.

01:25:09.239 --> 01:25:11.960
They humbly explained,

01:25:11.960 --> 01:25:15.800
It all belongs to another king.

01:25:15.800 --> 01:25:19.960
Subuza wanted to know who this was.

01:25:19.960 --> 01:25:23.000
He is Jesus Christ.

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:24.600
Subuza replied,

01:25:24.600 --> 01:25:27.880
Oh, he is a great king.

01:25:27.880 --> 01:25:33.000
I don't want to take anything that belongs to him.

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:38.199
Our brothers continue loyally announcing God's kingdom.

01:25:38.199 --> 01:25:45.960
Currently, there are over 3,000 publishers conducting over 4,000 Bible studies.

01:25:45.960 --> 01:25:55.560
The country also hosts refugees from Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda, and various other countries.

01:25:55.560 --> 01:26:03.239
And publishers go to the camp to preach extending a warm welcome and a message of hope.

01:26:03.239 --> 01:26:11.720
You can feel the love our brothers in the Nunguyoyo congregation have for neighbor and each other.

01:26:11.720 --> 01:26:15.319
They wish to send that love to you.

01:26:15.319 --> 01:26:18.119
The World Wide Brotherhood.

01:26:18.119 --> 01:26:24.920
From the world headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses, this is JW Broadcasting.
