00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:06.490
If you have seen our broadcast of the annual meeting that was held last October, you're

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:09.890
aware of the fact that our songbook is being revised.

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:13.970
Well, perhaps as some of you missed that broadcast.

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:19.570
So you may be wondering, why is it necessary to make changes to the songbook?

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.690
Well, as we explained at the annual meeting, some of the expressions used in our current

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:30.449
songbook were drawn from the earlier edition of the New World Translation.

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.969
The translation has been revised as you know.

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:41.570
Instead of the desirable things of the nations, we now say the precious things of the nations.

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.729
Instead of loving kindness, we use loyal love.

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:50.850
Long suffering is rendered patience and so forth.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.009
Since some of the terminology used in the songbook had to be adjusted, the governing body decided

00:00:56.009 --> 00:01:02.170
to add a few songs as well, and we are very happy for that.

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.650
Now those in attendance at the annual meeting this year were invited to sing three new

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:13.849
songs, and one of them was composed specially to mark the 100th anniversary of the establishment

00:01:13.849 --> 00:01:16.530
of the kingdom.

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.069
If you weren't present at the annual meeting this year, don't worry, you'll get your

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:24.569
chance to learn the new songs and soon.

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:28.810
And you won't have to wait until the new songbook is released either.

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:34.969
From time to time, new songs will be released on our website for you to download.

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:41.250
Not only that, but at times we will even conclude the service meeting by singing one of the

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.489
new songs.

00:01:43.489 --> 00:01:49.769
Case in point, during the week of January 5th, an entire service meeting has been set

00:01:49.769 --> 00:01:53.810
aside to help us appreciate our kingdom songs.

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.129
One of the new songs will be sung on that occasion.

00:01:57.129 --> 00:02:02.730
It's entitled, The Kingdom is in place, let it come.

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:09.449
You guessed it, that's the song that was composed to mark the kingdom's 100th anniversary.

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:11.289
Would you like to hear it?

00:02:11.289 --> 00:02:13.289
Please listen and watch.

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:36.509
Always have faith, always you will be.

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:45.750
You've given the throne to your son, he rules by your decree.

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:54.909
The kingdom has been brought to earth, his rulership will fill the earth.

00:02:54.909 --> 00:03:04.050
For now has cognition and kingdom and mind.

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:20.020
The kingdom is in place, it come, let it come, for the devil is short.

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:24.620
We know what this will mean.

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:33.780
The living in times of distress, we see the things unseen.

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:52.199
The kingdom has been brought to earth, his rulership will fill the kingdom and mind.

00:03:52.199 --> 00:04:05.039
The kingdom is in place.

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:10.599
What a majestic song of praise to Jehovah, isn't that beautiful?

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:16.560
But how can we prepare to sing that song, as well as the others that will follow?

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:22.000
We take you now to our studios in Patterson, New York, where our music choral arrangements

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.000
are produced.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.360
We'd like to introduce you to brothers Ted Adams and Danny Baker, who have worked with

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:34.480
our orchestra for years, and we also have with us Chris and Susan Maver, who both have

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.079
a background in music.

00:04:36.079 --> 00:04:43.879
Ted, we're counting on you and your guests to help us prepare to sing the new songs.

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:45.480
Thank you, brothers plain.

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:49.800
Singing is an important prominent feature of our worship.

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.720
So we want to be able to face the challenges of singing in a congregation setting.

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.160
There's a special challenge when we're learning a new song.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.160
What is that?

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:02.120
Well, I think learning a new song is like breaking in a new pair of shoes.

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:07.120
At first, the new songs aren't as comfortable as the ones that we're used to singing.

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:13.319
But after singing them for a while, exerting a little effort, well, these could become our

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:16.040
most favorite songs to sing.

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:20.639
Some of us have a hard time learning new songs, but we have to remember that these new

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:23.480
songs were composed for a good reason.

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.240
It's actually a scriptural reason, isn't it?

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:26.240
That's right.

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:31.519
You know, throughout the scriptures, we often see an expression like this, sing to Jehovah

00:05:31.519 --> 00:05:33.519
a new song.

00:05:33.519 --> 00:05:40.240
And the Bible tells us why new songs were composed and sung and why we should learn new songs

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.199
today and sing them.

00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:46.240
The 98th Psalm in verse one gives us a good reason.

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:53.519
It says, sing to Jehovah a new song for he has done wonderful things.

00:05:53.519 --> 00:05:58.920
Now we think about what Jehovah is doing today with his organization, truly wonderful things.

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:04.480
He's accomplishing to glorify his name and to help his servants here on earth.

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:10.680
And each of us in our personal lives have experienced Jehovah's wonderful things in our lives

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:11.680
personally.

00:06:11.839 --> 00:06:17.920
Now that the new songs also reflect a clear understanding of the Bible, as well as expressing

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:23.160
the love that we have for Jehovah and our appreciation for his tender care.

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:28.480
So when we get these new songs, we can think about what Jehovah has done for us personally.

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:29.480
That's true.

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:33.839
But also, especially what he's done with the organization now, this should put us on

00:06:33.839 --> 00:06:37.519
the right frame of mind and heart to really learn the songs.

00:06:38.079 --> 00:06:44.000
What if we feel that we're just not as good as the singers on the recordings?

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:50.240
Well, actually, the singers on the recordings, some might be interested to know, very few of

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:55.680
those used for vocal renditions have had any professional training or professional experience.

00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:00.560
So all of them have had to learn to sing better mainly through practice.

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:02.319
And that's comforting for the rest of us.

00:07:02.319 --> 00:07:06.160
We feel like we may not sing so well, but we all can improve.

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:08.000
We all can learn to sing better.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.560
And of course, the more you sing, the easier it will become.

00:07:11.279 --> 00:07:15.839
Now, some of us hesitate to sing because we feel the notes are a bit too high for us.

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:22.480
Would you give us some ideas how we can change the range of our voice and be able to sing these

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:23.480
higher notes?

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:29.199
Well, you know, for young people, the range is not a problem, but as we age, unfortunately,

00:07:29.199 --> 00:07:34.800
like the rest of our bodies, our voices can lose range, like we lose range of motion.

00:07:35.439 --> 00:07:41.040
So we can regain some of our range by doing a type of stretching with our voice,

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:45.279
just as an athlete would stretch before a game or before going for a run.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.279
We can do that very simply by using like a humming sound, maybe in the shower,

00:07:51.279 --> 00:07:53.920
the kitchen, the car, somewhere you feel comfortable.

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:59.199
And just using a humming sound to gently go through your full range of your voice,

00:07:59.199 --> 00:08:02.240
and then gently pushing the limits of it.

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:06.560
And in that way, we can regain and maintain the range of our voice.

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:09.600
So that helps us with the range, but now what about those high notes?

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:12.959
While those high notes can be a bit of a challenge,

00:08:12.959 --> 00:08:16.720
but you know, there are a couple of things we can do that'll really make them easier to produce.

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:21.600
One is we need to make sure we take a really good breath before we sing the phrase with the high

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:26.959
note in it, because more breath energy makes it much easier to produce a higher note.

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:34.159
Also, physiologically, we need more space in the mouth and throat area to make it easier

00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:39.759
to produce a high note. So we would even see that on the outside when the mouth gets larger,

00:08:39.759 --> 00:08:42.240
going from a lower note to a higher note.

00:08:48.529 --> 00:08:52.210
Then it won't feel so tight, and it's easier to produce a higher note.

00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:56.210
Good. So those two things are take a deeper, bigger breath for the high notes,

00:08:56.690 --> 00:08:59.330
and then more space created by the mouth.

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:00.210
Good.

00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:04.610
When how does the composing team help us with some of these high note issues?

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:10.049
Well, the composers do take the musical range of the human voice into account,

00:09:10.049 --> 00:09:12.370
including the range of unskilled singers.

00:09:13.009 --> 00:09:18.370
And in a musical composition, in dealing with high notes in particular, there's basically two

00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:24.049
ways to get up there as a composer. One is to walk your way up there, going up the scale.

00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:25.889
That's the easier method.

00:09:26.769 --> 00:09:31.169
Vocally, that's easier to get up there. At times in a composition,

00:09:31.889 --> 00:09:37.409
there are jumps from low notes to high notes, but there are jumps which are more logical

00:09:37.409 --> 00:09:41.809
musically, which also makes them more instinctively comfortable for us to sing,

00:09:41.809 --> 00:09:47.250
even if we're not trained singers. So the compositions have taken these factors into account.

00:09:47.889 --> 00:09:52.210
And I think two keys here. Number one, what Susan has been talking about is to

00:09:53.169 --> 00:09:57.250
try and develop our voices a little more, coupled out with learning the song.

00:09:57.889 --> 00:10:03.330
And if you have those two things in place, high notes are not the issue that maybe you thought they

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:11.019
would be. You know, it sounds like the fundamentals for good singing are basically the same for good

00:10:11.019 --> 00:10:15.820
public speaking. Like the instructions we get in the Ministry School textbook. Exactly.

00:10:16.539 --> 00:10:22.059
Maintaining good posture, standing up nice and straight, and being sure to take good deep breaths

00:10:22.059 --> 00:10:27.899
before speaking. It's very true that poor posture and shallow breathing are definitely the

00:10:27.899 --> 00:10:34.460
enemies of good singing. It's just the way that Jehovah created us physiologically. We have these

00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:39.179
tiny little vocal cords, but when we take a good breath and send the air through them,

00:10:39.179 --> 00:10:43.980
then it resonates through our bones and tissues, and we can produce sound easily.

00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:48.700
Good, thanks Susan. Good ideas on technique. Now here's the problem that comes up during our meetings.

00:10:49.419 --> 00:10:54.940
Sometimes the piano can't be heard. The volume of the piano is not high enough,

00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:59.659
and when you fill the auditorium with voices, it just drowns the piano out.

00:11:00.379 --> 00:11:06.059
Now how can we handle that? Well, the key to solving that problem is for the brother at the

00:11:06.059 --> 00:11:13.820
sound console to be listening, listening not just to the piano volume, but listening also to

00:11:13.899 --> 00:11:19.740
what you refer to, how the singing is going. For example, if the singers can't stay together,

00:11:20.379 --> 00:11:25.340
or if they can't stay with the piano recording, they're either ahead of it or behind it,

00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:29.179
then that's the cue for the sound operator to turn the piano up.

00:11:30.539 --> 00:11:38.220
So the operator then has to be free to focus on the sound. Just as when you're driving a car,

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:41.019
you have to keep your hand on the wheel, make adjustments to stay on the road.

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:45.580
Yes, I think free for that task is the key word there.

00:11:46.539 --> 00:11:50.220
The reality is that at the beginning of many of our meeting programs,

00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:55.899
the brother or brothers in our sound department are trying to multitask with various little

00:11:55.899 --> 00:12:00.700
things that happen right at the beginning of the program, and this issue of the piano volume

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:07.019
sometimes just gets overlooked. So at least one person back there has to be dedicated exclusively

00:12:07.019 --> 00:12:11.019
at that moment to listening to and adjusting the piano volume.

00:12:11.659 --> 00:12:17.980
And this would be especially true whenever a new song is scheduled for a program.

00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:24.700
It is definitely we need to be listening to the cues or the music when it's being played,

00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:29.100
but you know this doesn't relieve us of the personal responsibility that each of us have

00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:34.460
to become familiar with the music even ahead of time before going to the meeting.

00:12:34.539 --> 00:12:38.059
And that way we can be prepared to sing the songs when we arrive.

00:12:38.059 --> 00:12:40.220
The same way we prepare for other parts in the middle.

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:45.019
That's right. Well, doesn't that just put us right in mind of family worship then?

00:12:45.019 --> 00:12:48.700
Because family worship is where so much meeting preparation is done typically.

00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:56.779
So include the music during family worship, get the songbook out, turn on the piano recording,

00:12:56.779 --> 00:13:02.379
sing along. Even better if we can play the piano or if we play guitar, do it live,

00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:08.379
and sing to it live. The simplified chords are up there in JW.org that we can download.

00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:14.620
But even for social occasions, social gatherings, who we can sing the songs,

00:13:15.179 --> 00:13:19.740
the idea is prepare for this part of our worship with the congregation or even for our

00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:25.100
assemblies and conventions. Yeah, you know, the faithful slave has really given us the tools

00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:30.620
to be well prepared not on our congregation meetings, but also at these events, the assemblies and

00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:37.899
conventions. Months ahead of time, the programs are posted on the website and in those programs are

00:13:37.899 --> 00:13:43.259
the songs that will be sung at these events. And so we can be well prepared by downloading,

00:13:43.259 --> 00:13:49.419
as you mentioned, the piano music or the sheet music from JW.org and include that in our

00:13:49.419 --> 00:13:55.340
preparation for our these assemblies. You mentioned downloading a number of things,

00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:59.659
but is that hard to do? Well, they've tried to make it as simple as possible.

00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:05.899
On the home page is the publications tab. You click on that. It brings up a tab on the left side

00:14:05.899 --> 00:14:12.139
that says music. You click on that and all the music products are right there. The MP3s for the

00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:19.019
vocal renditions, the piano accompaniment, orchestral arrangements. There's also a tab for

00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:25.980
the song, same to Jehovah. If you click on that, there's a PDF tab and that gives you all the

00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:28.779
sheet music that you need, including the simplified guitar chords.

00:14:30.299 --> 00:14:35.580
Well, you know, Ted, as simple as that sounds, we do understand that many still find

00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:40.139
navigating websites to be a challenging thing. And at the same time, we know that some of our

00:14:40.139 --> 00:14:46.299
brothers and sisters still don't own the equipment, the computer equipment, to do their own downloads.

00:14:46.299 --> 00:14:50.700
This is where the congregation, and in particular, the elders and ministerial servants,

00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:57.340
can take the lead in helping everyone to have these materials. Because as we help each other that

00:14:57.340 --> 00:15:01.899
way, especially the brothers taking the lead, then this really engenders a spirit of

00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:09.340
enthusiasm, interest in this feature of our worship. It seems like we have all the tools that we

00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:14.700
need then to learn the new songs and be well prepared to sing them at our congregation meetings

00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:18.940
with the help of the elders, even as brought out here. And it really is important to do that

00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:24.299
because some of the songs besides not knowing the melodies or the words, it also could be written

00:15:24.299 --> 00:15:30.299
in a particular style that maybe we're not used to singing in. And so when we are listened to

00:15:30.299 --> 00:15:35.740
the music ahead of time, then we can come better familiar, not just with the tune and the words,

00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:41.580
but also the style in which they are written. Well, Chris, because you mentioned musical style,

00:15:42.299 --> 00:15:47.659
this brings up another personal matter, I think, for many of us. And that's how we view music

00:15:47.659 --> 00:15:55.179
itself. The point here is that it's all too common in this world to just be the product of the

00:15:55.179 --> 00:16:00.059
entertainment industry with respect to our musical tastes. They're in the business of selling

00:16:00.059 --> 00:16:04.539
what you might call ear candy. What that means is that anything that just quickly catches the

00:16:04.539 --> 00:16:09.019
ear and catches on becomes popular. Well, that's a very marketable product and they make a lot of money

00:16:09.019 --> 00:16:16.139
selling it. Well, it's kind of like candy that we like to eat when we're children. And we still

00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:20.700
like it when we grow up too, but the point is when we're children, that's kind of all we want.

00:16:22.139 --> 00:16:27.980
Later on, we have to learn to appreciate and enjoy the foods that are really better for us

00:16:28.379 --> 00:16:33.980
and the ones that we really need. Well, the music that we use in our worship is kind of like that

00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:41.340
healthy food. We might not yet have the taste for it, but we need to develop it because it's there

00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:47.259
to nourish us spiritually. And the governing body wants us all to sing praises to Jehovah.

00:16:47.259 --> 00:16:52.940
Just like back in King Jehoshite's time when the army was going out into battle, they were singing.

00:16:54.059 --> 00:16:59.820
And the scripture says they were joyfully singing praises to Jehovah. So we want to use all the

00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:05.420
tools that we have to learn the new songs and just start singing. You know, Ted, I couldn't help

00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:11.099
but thank the that's scriptural reference. It really indicates that those men were not at all

00:17:11.099 --> 00:17:17.339
timid about singing praises to Jehovah God. And really, that sets a pattern for us today.

00:17:18.299 --> 00:17:23.579
We should not feel shy or timid about singing at the kingdom hall or at any of our meetings

00:17:23.579 --> 00:17:30.140
praises to Jehovah God. And certainly we have the tools now to learn these new songs and to be

00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:34.460
just like those ancient Israelites singing praises to Jehovah with full heart and joy.

00:17:35.579 --> 00:17:40.779
What you just said, Chris, really helps to make the point that we should view our singing and

00:17:40.779 --> 00:17:48.779
worship as we view our prayers at that matter of being timid. Well, prayer is not always easy.

00:17:48.779 --> 00:17:54.619
Even even private prayer is not always easy. Sometimes we're praying about something painful or

00:17:54.700 --> 00:18:00.859
difficult or something that's kind of confusing at the time. So we're struggling for the clear

00:18:00.859 --> 00:18:05.259
thought. We're struggling even for the words to use in prayer, even though it's a private prayer.

00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:12.700
But we still manage to give that prayer to Jehovah because we love him and because we want to

00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:19.339
continue worshiping him. That's why even people with limited vocabularies can still pray very

00:18:19.339 --> 00:18:24.619
successfully, very effectively to Jehovah. And maybe that's the way some of us are as singers.

00:18:24.619 --> 00:18:31.980
We're limited. But that's okay. We still do it and we don't and we're not timid about it.

00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:38.140
We do it for the same important reasons that we love Jehovah and that we want to worship him this way.

00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:45.019
When we get to new songs, we want to be excited about learning them. These new songs express our

00:18:45.019 --> 00:18:51.339
devotion, our feeling for Jehovah. They also keep us in harmony with the greater understanding of

00:18:51.339 --> 00:18:56.859
scriptures. And of course, how Jehovah deals with us personally. Now we'll go back to our studio

00:18:56.859 --> 00:19:12.769
in Brooklyn. Thank you so much, panel. Your insights have been most helpful.
