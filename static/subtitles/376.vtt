00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:08.099
A key factor that promotes unity among Jehovah's people is the fact that we receive very clear

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:14.380
direction and regular reminders. Just think about what we receive each month from Jehovah's

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:20.780
Organization. Unfailingly, we receive a study edition of the Watchtower. We receive a public

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:26.179
edition of the Watchtower, or a Wake magazine. The Life and Ministry meeting workbook and

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:34.299
our long program on JW Broadcasting. Almost daily, we receive new articles, news, and legal

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:42.299
updates posted to JW.org. Are you having a challenge keeping it up with it all? How good

00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:50.619
for that button on the homepage of JW.org that's entitled What's New? Like a gourmet,

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:57.100
course, meal, these regular provisions from Jehovah's Organization not only delight us,

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:03.899
but they keep us alive spiritually, energized to move on in our service to Jehovah.

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:09.980
What about those of us who are entrusted with responsibility, whether in the congregation or

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:17.900
here at Bethel? We are not lacking for clear direction and regular reminders. You might find it

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:25.659
interesting to learn that during the 2016 calendar year, headquarters prepared 80 letters of

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:31.500
direction that were sent to the brothers and the fields, such as elders and circuit overseers.

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:37.420
For the benefit of the branch committees in 90 branch offices, during that same time period,

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:44.620
the six governing body committees sent out 240 letters to help these brothers carry out their

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:51.500
work in a unified way. And of course, that's in addition to the thousands of letters that are sent

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:58.859
each month in reply to the individual questions that come from the branches. Such clear and timely

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:05.579
direction is a key factor that contributes to our unity as Jehovah's people. Before a few

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:11.740
minutes, let's discuss a second factor that strengthens our unity. Our commenters all touched on

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:18.939
this. It's our personal willingness to cooperate with theocratic direction.

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:24.539
In this regard, I invite you to open up your Bible to Hebrews 13 and verse 7.

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:34.699
Here we'd like to ask the question, what type of relationship does Jehovah want us to cultivate

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:41.259
with our overseers with the hardworking elders? Verse 7 in Hebrews chapter 13 says,

00:02:42.139 --> 00:02:47.419
remember those who are taking the lead among you who have spoken the word of God to you,

00:02:47.419 --> 00:02:52.460
and as you contemplate how their conduct turns out, imitate their faith.

00:02:53.659 --> 00:03:02.219
Let's focus on the first action word. Remember, to remember means to keep in mind the good work

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:09.819
and elder does. Doing so will help us to cultivate warm feelings, feelings of love and appreciation

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:16.060
for the elders. A recent study edition of the Watchtower says that the word remember could also be

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:24.620
translated mention. So our heartfelt interest in the elders taking the lead moves us to mention

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:32.139
them in our prayers to Jehovah. Think about that relationship that God encourages us to cultivate

00:03:32.219 --> 00:03:39.259
with our overseers. What a contrast that is to the rebellious contentious attitude that many in

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:46.060
the world have towards those in positions of authority. Notice in the same chapter, Hebrews chapter

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:54.379
13, what verse 17 adds? We're told, be obedient to those who are taking the lead among you and be

00:03:54.379 --> 00:04:01.099
submissive for they are keeping watch over you as those who will render an account so that they may

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:09.580
do this with joy and not with sign for this would be damaging to you. Here we're admonished to

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:17.980
obey and be submissive. Of course, obedience is easier when we understand the direction given when

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:23.819
it suits our personal preference, but what if some theocratic direction we receive does not make

00:04:23.819 --> 00:04:32.620
sense, takes us by surprise or doesn't suit us personally? In such cases, the latter part of

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:40.699
that verse comes into play where we're directed to be submissive. Why? As the verse highlights because

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:49.980
in the long run, yielding to theocratic direction is for our own good. Of course, this does not

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:57.019
make following direction easy, knowing that it's for our good. To illustrate the challenge we face,

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:04.459
you might imagine yourself trekking in the wilderness with the Israelites during that 40-year period.

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:11.740
Imagine that you and your family have been walking for some days and all of a sudden the pillar of

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:20.620
cloud stops. You stop. You look around. You're obedient to the direction, but you do ask yourself

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:28.860
how long will we be here? A day? A week? A few months? You ask yourself should we pack unpack all of

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:35.740
our belongings now? So at the beginning, you decide to unpack just a few things. Then a few days go

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:41.259
by. You get tired of hunting through all your belongings. So you decide to unpack everything.

00:05:41.259 --> 00:05:48.699
Guess what happens next? The pillar of cloud starts lifting up and moving. Now it's time to start packing.

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:53.740
Is it easy to follow through on theocratic direction? Not always.

00:05:55.019 --> 00:06:02.459
In this regard, notice how the Israelites responded to the movements of Jehovah through that cloud.

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:13.420
In Numbers 9, please turn your attention to verse 17 and then we'll read verse 22. Numbers 9 and verse 17 says,

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:20.300
Whenever the cloud lifted from the tent, the Israelites would promptly depart and in the place where

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:28.459
the cloud would remain, there is where the Israelites would encamp. Verse 22, whether it was two days,

00:06:28.459 --> 00:06:34.220
a month or longer, as long as the cloud stayed over the tabernacle, the Israelites remained

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:43.819
encamped and would not depart. But when it lifted, they would depart. Are you working to cultivate a

00:06:43.819 --> 00:06:53.019
similar spirit towards theocratic direction? The Bethel family sets an outstanding example in this

00:06:53.019 --> 00:06:59.180
regard. When preparing these comments, I couldn't help but think of an overseer I worked closely with

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:06.459
at Brooklyn Bethel, who always carried in his pocket a pen and a notepad. As soon as someone asked

00:07:06.459 --> 00:07:11.819
him to follow through on something, out came the pen and notepad and he was making a note. And in

00:07:11.819 --> 00:07:17.339
many cases, before the day was over, he would have followed through on all those action items.

00:07:18.139 --> 00:07:27.019
The principle of Luke 1610 was true of this brother. The person faithful in what is least is faithful also

00:07:27.019 --> 00:07:34.060
in much. And as a result, it's obvious that Jehovah's organization has been able to entrust this

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:42.139
brother with many weighty responsibilities. Well, that brother is not unique. We have many

00:07:42.139 --> 00:07:48.540
brothers and sisters in the worldwide brotherhood who demonstrate such an interest in following

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:54.860
through on theocratic direction. Recently, while visiting a branch office in Africa,

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:59.980
the overseer of the local design construction department told me that his department meets for

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:06.379
15 minutes, three times a week to read out loud a portion of the LDC department guidelines.

00:08:07.019 --> 00:08:12.779
If you like mnemonics, that's the DC-50. Why does he feel that's necessary?

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:19.740
As he told me, he has found that a review with the entire department of the printed direction

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:25.660
helps the whole department to be sure they're on the same page that they understood the direction

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:31.339
clearly. The regular review has also brought to their attention points that they may have overlooked

00:08:31.339 --> 00:08:36.620
when they first read the guidelines or that they now understand even better in the light of

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:45.019
changing circumstances. Again, another heartwarming example of willing cooperation and prompt follow

00:08:45.019 --> 00:08:54.299
through. Well, what does this teach us today? Today, we are being provided with an abundance of clear

00:08:54.299 --> 00:09:02.139
direction and timely reminders. Jehovah is leading us through the elders who are taking the lead

00:09:02.139 --> 00:09:08.940
among us. His presence is as clear to us as it was to the Israelites who were following the pillar

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:17.419
of cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night. So as we finish up the final leg of our wilderness

00:09:17.419 --> 00:09:31.259
journey, may we all be resolved to cooperate fully with any theocratic direction we're given.
