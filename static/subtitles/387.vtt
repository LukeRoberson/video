00:00:01.139 --> 00:00:06.139
Let's consider the account that's referred to in our Watchtower comments.

00:00:06.139 --> 00:00:10.140
If you turn with me and your Bibles to the book of Luke,

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.140
we'll read this in its entirety.

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:22.489
Follow with me, please, Luke chapter 10 verses 38 through 42.

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:24.489
It says, now as they went on their way,

00:00:24.489 --> 00:00:26.489
he entered into a certain village.

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:31.489
Here a woman named Martha received him as a guest in her house.

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:33.490
She also had a sister called Mary,

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:37.490
who said down at the feet of the Lord and kept listening to what he was saying.

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:43.490
Martha, on the other hand, was distracted with attending to many duties.

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:45.490
So she came to him and said,

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:51.490
Lord, does it not matter to you that my sister has left me alone to attend to things?

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:53.490
Tell her to come and help me.

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.490
And answer the Lord said to her,

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:02.490
Martha, Martha, you are anxious and disturbed about many things.

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.489
A few things, though, are needed.

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.489
Or just one.

00:01:07.489 --> 00:01:10.489
For her part, Mary chose the good portion,

00:01:10.489 --> 00:01:14.489
and it will not be taken away from her.

00:01:14.489 --> 00:01:16.489
Did you note in verse 40,

00:01:16.489 --> 00:01:23.489
it said that Martha was distracted with attending to many duties.

00:01:23.489 --> 00:01:27.489
I was quite likely that Martha may not have felt that way.

00:01:27.489 --> 00:01:30.489
After all, she was not engaged in some sort of hobby

00:01:30.489 --> 00:01:32.489
or materialistic pursuit.

00:01:32.489 --> 00:01:35.489
And her duties were certainly not trivial.

00:01:35.489 --> 00:01:39.489
She was tending to the needs of Jesus.

00:01:39.489 --> 00:01:40.489
And we think about that.

00:01:40.489 --> 00:01:43.489
Taking care of the Messiah, the Son of God,

00:01:43.489 --> 00:01:46.489
that had to be one of the greatest privileges,

00:01:46.489 --> 00:01:49.489
one of the greatest honors an individual could have.

00:01:49.489 --> 00:01:51.489
So it's no wonder in verse 40,

00:01:51.489 --> 00:01:57.489
she encourages Jesus to tell her sister Mary to come and help her.

00:01:58.489 --> 00:02:02.489
But this raises an interesting question.

00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:08.490
Is it possible for Christians today to become distracted,

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:14.490
even while engaging in worthwhile theocratic pursuits?

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.490
Well, consider three examples.

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.490
We want to do more in the ministry,

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.490
so we decide to learn a new language.

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.490
We focus on learning the language,

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:27.490
but in the process,

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:34.490
we neglect time to read and study the Bible in our mother tongue.

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:36.490
Or perhaps we decide we're going to move

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.490
and serve with a need is greater.

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:41.490
And we began to occupy so much of our time

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.490
and learning about the country,

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:45.490
its customs and the food,

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:50.490
that that begins to overshadow our family worship

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:53.490
and personal study.

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.490
Or how about our Bethel assignment?

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:58.490
We love our assignment.

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:59.490
Our work is very interesting.

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:02.490
We enjoy working hard.

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:05.490
But we become so absorbed and staying ahead

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:08.490
in our work and keeping things moving

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:13.490
that we began to do self-imposed overtime work

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:15.490
on a regular basis,

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:17.490
neglecting our meeting attendance,

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:21.800
perhaps even time with our mate.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.800
Did you notice each situation began

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.800
as a worthwhile theocratic endeavor?

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.800
But can we see how it's possible

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.800
that each hypothetical situation

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.800
could become a realistic distraction?

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.800
Let's just go back for a moment

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.800
to the account in Luke,

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.800
because it's important to note that Jesus never said

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.800
that what Martha was doing was wrong.

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.800
Like our text mentioned, he loved Martha.

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.800
She was a spiritual woman,

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.800
and he was very appreciative for what she was doing

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.800
in his behalf.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.800
But he very kindly reminds her and shows her

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.800
that her meal preparations were distracting her

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.800
to the point where it interfered

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.800
with her receiving what he refers to in verse 42

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.800
as the good portion.

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:13.800
A spiritual activity,

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.800
listening to his teachings.

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.800
Martha was not taking advantage

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:24.800
of a unique opportunity to deepen her faith.

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.800
Very interesting, the September 1st, 1999

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.800
watched our elaborates on this account.

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.800
And it makes this comment,

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.800
is this moved by love some today,

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:35.800
much like Martha,

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.800
do their utmost to minister

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.800
to the needs of fellow believers.

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.800
They are practical-minded and quick to action

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.800
and Jehovah promises to reward their labors of love.

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.800
Others perhaps more closely resemble Mary.

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.800
They are quiet, contemplative.

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.800
Their eagerness to meditate upon God's word

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.800
helps them to stay solidly rooted in the faith.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.800
But then it says this,

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:08.800
both fill a vital need in the Christian congregation.

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.800
And by extension we'll just add

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.800
in the Bethel family as well.

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.800
It continues in the end, however,

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.800
all should choose the good portion,

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.800
by putting spiritual or primary emphasis

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.800
on spiritual things.

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.800
Well, that helps us to see the balance, doesn't it?

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.800
May we thanks perhaps in a modern day application?

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.800
What if the circuit overseer came to visit our congregation

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.800
and everyone wanted to go out and work with him in the ministry?

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.800
But no one was willing to stop

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.800
and provide him with a meal.

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.800
So that wouldn't be good with it or hospitable.

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.800
Just like it would be balanced for him

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.800
to have multiple meal invitations

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.800
and then no one showed up to support him

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.800
and his wife in the ministry.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.800
So the point is we want to make sure

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.800
that we care for our needs and the needs of others,

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:06.800
but also making sure that we remember our priorities.

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.800
So what's the key to ensuring that our endeavors

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:11.800
will not become distractions?

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:14.800
Well, notice on the Bible explains this term

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.800
with me pleased to Philippians chapter 1.

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:24.029
In Philippians chapter 1, notice verses 9 and 10.

00:06:24.029 --> 00:06:30.360
And this is what I continue praying,

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:33.360
that your love may abound still more and more

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.360
with accurate knowledge and full discernment,

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:39.360
that you may make sure of the more important things

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:41.360
so that you may be flawless

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:45.360
and not stumbling others up to the day of Christ.

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:50.360
So before we undertake any endeavor, any assignment,

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:54.360
you notice we want to pray, reason things out,

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:57.360
use accurate knowledge and discernment.

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:01.360
And if we're able to use that insight, good judgment,

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:05.360
then it's going to help us to discern or perceive

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:08.360
what is most important to God.

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:10.360
And when we know that,

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:13.360
well, then we can harmonize our thoughts,

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:16.360
our actions, our decisions accordingly.

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:19.360
By making sure of the more important things,

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:22.360
we gain Jehovah's blessing and favor.

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:26.360
So think about those situations we mentioned.

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:28.360
If we're going to learn a new language

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:32.360
or move what the need is greater, well, that's amazing.

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:34.360
It's appreciated and it's definitely needed.

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:36.360
In fact, we're encouraged to do it

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:38.360
if we have the circumstances.

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:40.360
And of course, in our beltful assignment,

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:44.360
Christ does not want to work hard to get to know our work well

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:47.360
and give our all to Jehovah.

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:51.360
But can we appreciate how Jesus shows us

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:54.360
a valuable and balanced lesson

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:58.360
that even in bureaucratic worthwhile pursuits,

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:01.360
we should not let anything distract

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:04.360
or impede our spiritual progress.

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:08.360
We don't want to miss opportunities to strengthen our faith,

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:11.360
to bond with our brothers and sisters,

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:15.360
and most importantly, to bond with Jehovah.

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:17.360
If we just go back to Luke,

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:21.360
notice how Luke concluded his words to Martha.

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:23.360
In verse 42, he says,

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:26.360
because Mary chose the good portion,

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:30.360
it will not be taken away from her.

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:33.360
So what she learned that day,

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:37.360
the commendation, the spiritual instruction from Jesus,

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:39.360
Mary would never forget that.

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:43.360
That would stay with her for the rest of her life.

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:48.360
And likely, we can recall a similar account,

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:51.360
maybe a talk, a meeting,

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:53.360
something that was said at the convention,

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:56.360
a spiritual discussion that we had with someone.

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:58.360
And that conversation or discussion

00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:01.360
had a profound impact on our faith

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:04.360
and our relationship with the Jehovah.

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:06.360
Well, if you've had situations like that,

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:08.360
those are precious.

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:10.360
They're very special.

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:14.360
And those are things that we want to hold on to.

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:16.360
So what a beautiful reminder we had today

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:19.360
and let's not be distracted.

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:21.360
May we work to strengthen our spirituality

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:23.360
and relationship with the Jehovah

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:26.360
by always choosing the good portion.

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:29.360
And if we do, we can be assured that Jehovah

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:31.360
will bless our efforts.
