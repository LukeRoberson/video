00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:15.140
The Ferro Islands are also called the land of maybe.

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.140
The weather is very diverse and can rapidly change.

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.140
So when you begin in the ministry, the weather can be sunny and then 10 minutes later,

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.140
you find yourself in a massive rain shower and everything gets wet.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.140
When there's another challenge, we have some severe winter storms,

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:41.140
so you have to be careful that your service partner or the car door doesn't blow away

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:46.350
while you're getting out of the car.

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.350
We make sure to wear clothes appropriate for the weather

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.350
and also to keep updated on the weather situation

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.350
and to see where in your territory the weather is most suitable and then adapt.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.349
If the weather is nice, then we try to go from house to house.

00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:08.349
And if the weather is bad, then you can go on calls where you can come inside,

00:01:08.349 --> 00:01:12.349
meaning weather will invite you in or where the entrance is covered.

00:01:13.349 --> 00:01:16.349
And you can plan your ministry so that if the weather gets bad,

00:01:16.349 --> 00:01:21.920
you can take visits that you know will be at home that time of day.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.920
When the weather is poor, it's good to adjust.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.920
Maybe you can do some telephone witnessing or letter writing.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.920
At a meeting for pioneers, an elder reminded us that when the weather is bad,

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:38.920
try not to think the weather is bad again, but instead, yay!

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.920
Now people are actually at home.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.920
It is a good idea to have a plan for whom you'd like to visit and what you'd like to talk to them about.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.920
Because then when it rains or the weather is an ideal,

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:57.920
you focus on your plan instead of thinking that now I've been out preaching for five hours in stormy weather.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.920
I think Ecclesiastes 11-4 applies quite well to our territory.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.920
That the one who watches the wind will not so see,

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.919
and the one who looks at the clouds will not reach.

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:16.919
If we have to wait for the perfect weather conditions to preach, then we wouldn't be out that often.

00:02:16.919 --> 00:02:22.919
Something else that helps to endure bad weather is to think of the first publishers in the Faroe Islands.

00:02:22.919 --> 00:02:29.919
They fought with sea sickness, bad weather, and they had to hike over the mountains to visit remote settlements.

00:02:29.919 --> 00:02:36.919
They overcame these obstacles, and it motivates me to overcome the challenges I'm facing today.

00:02:37.919 --> 00:02:39.919
I remember when we came to the Faroe Islands.

00:02:39.919 --> 00:02:41.919
I looked out the window and thought,

00:02:41.919 --> 00:02:45.919
is it even possible to go out in the ministry in this kind of weather?

00:02:45.919 --> 00:02:50.919
And then we arrived at the Meeting for Field Service and the friends with children and strollers were there,

00:02:50.919 --> 00:02:53.919
and we're positive and ready for field service.

00:02:53.919 --> 00:02:57.919
It made me think that if they can do it, then I can too.

00:02:57.919 --> 00:03:04.520
So we are a team of publishers and we have the weather as our challenge.

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.520
And especially when the weather is bad, we encourage one another.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:14.150
We really like the song, the life of a pioneer.

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.150
It's an amazing song.

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:22.150
It says, in the work we endure with a sunshine or rain, because we loved Jehovah.

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:29.360
We really want people to get to know Jehovah. They need to know the truth.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.360
When Jesus said that we should preach,

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:37.360
I think that he also would have put on a raincoat and gone out to preach the good news.

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:43.360
We experience how Jehovah blesses our efforts when we go in the ministry.

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:48.360
And you especially feel it when you persist in your efforts to preach when the weather isn't good.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:54.360
It may be that one day you get a really nice conversation with a person about the Bible.

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.360
I also feel it gives me great joy.

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.360
Paul said that the one who soes bountifully will also reap bountifully.

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.360
So if you want to sow bountifully in the Faroe Islands,

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.360
you need to preach also when the weather is bad.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:13.360
And we feel that we have reaped bountifully by nice return visits and Bible studies.

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:20.360
I feel it's worth all the effort because we see that people in the territory really appreciate what they are learning.

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:26.360
All we do in our ministry is motivated by love for Jehovah and the people in the territory.

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.360
And it won't be changed by bad weather.

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.360
It's an opportunity to show that our worship is wholehearted.

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:38.360
You don't just go in the ministry when everything is good and the sun is shining.

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:45.250
I think we have become more enduring and flexible in our ministry.
