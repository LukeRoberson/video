00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:09.890
I started pioneering in 1978 straight out of school and then after 17 years I had to stop

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:16.010
because I could no longer meet the R requirement. At one of the conventions I saw some sisters

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:22.570
interpreting the program into sign language and so I thought that even if I couldn't continue

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:28.649
pioneering I could do something more into over service by learning sign language and

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:34.450
so I started to do that because I was deeply grateful to Jehovah for all year done for me.

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:42.570
I resumed pioneering again in September 2009 and then I had the added blessing of

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:51.130
now pioneering in sign language field. One day I met Cecilia, she suffers from a genetic

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:59.530
syndrome called Asher's which causes deafness coupled with tunnel vision that can over time

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:08.329
lead to blindness. Because of that disability it made her extremely shy so it was very

00:01:08.329 --> 00:01:16.489
difficult to communicate with her. I started studying with her in October 2009 and very quickly

00:01:16.489 --> 00:01:22.730
she started attending meetings. I would fetch her for the meetings and then drop her off at home

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:28.730
afterwards. I lived about five minutes from the kingdom wall but she was 30 minutes away

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:37.129
and quickly I realised that she would also need to put in effort to get to the meetings in order

00:01:37.129 --> 00:01:44.650
to make progress. Cecilia lived close to where she could catch a taxi up to the train line

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:51.129
and then it would be two train journeys to get to the kingdom hall so it would take her each way

00:01:51.930 --> 00:02:01.609
an hour and a half to two hours. She also lived in a notoriously unsafe area because of gang violence

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:09.050
but I knew that Cecilia was strong willed enough and independent enough in spite of her

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:17.129
timidity and reticence to be able to get herself to the meetings. Cecilia was attending meetings

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:25.770
regularly but instead of a skirt she wore pants to the meeting. So I chatted to Nancy as the

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:32.409
staguer at the time was accompanying me to her study most weeks so that we could try and figure

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:38.330
out a way of helping her to make the change she needed to make. It took about a year of

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:45.770
gently showing pictures, reviewing the Bible principles but eventually she did get the point.

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:52.409
One of the weekends that she was staying over I went into her room and on her bed neatly laid out

00:02:53.610 --> 00:03:00.330
with a skirt on top ready for the meeting. I thanked her over at that point because finally

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:07.849
our patience had been rewarded. We had all of our meetings on a Saturday with a lunch break

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:14.330
in between when we would associate but we noticed that Cecilia was isolating herself.

00:03:14.969 --> 00:03:23.370
To reinforce for Cecilia the principle of act 20 verse 35 a friend came up with the good idea

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:30.250
of helping her to bake cookies that I before the meeting. Cecilia shyly offered the cookies to

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:36.889
each person bed during the lunch break and it elicited such a warm response from the brothers

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:43.129
and sisters and friends there. It really drove home the point for Cecilia and it was beautiful

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:52.250
to see her after that come out of her shell. In July 2014 Cecilia gave her first student talk

00:03:53.530 --> 00:04:00.810
and in that month she also started publishing. There have been challenges particularly learning

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:09.530
sign language but even more so getting to understand the deaf culture the way that they think

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:19.689
also financial hardships but the challenges and the sacrifices were far outweighed by the blessings.

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:26.569
A day that's etched in my memory is the day that she told me she wanted to get baptized.

00:04:27.209 --> 00:04:34.810
Cecilia has really become like a daughter to me and I'm so proud of the enormous strides that

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:42.810
she made in the truth. In October 2015 she was baptized. I cried with joy that day.

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:50.970
I've been pioneering now for 28 years and over that time particularly since I started again

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:58.250
and with Cecilia many many many brothers and sisters in the congregation helped me they accompanied

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:06.089
me to a study. They became friends with her they took over when I went away. I could never have

00:05:06.089 --> 00:05:16.170
done it on my own. Above all Jehovah has helped me to cultivate qualities like patience, self-control,

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:22.889
humility, compassion. It was really wonderful to play a small part such a privilege

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:32.089
to help Cecilia to become part of Jehovah's family.
