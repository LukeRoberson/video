00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:08.839
Well, do you sometimes feel like you're running out of the two things that are mentioned in our text discussion today?

00:00:09.439 --> 00:00:11.439
Are you low on desire?

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:20.519
Do you lack motivation some days and you're just not sure where you are spiritually or emotionally?

00:00:21.399 --> 00:00:23.399
What about power?

00:00:23.879 --> 00:00:25.879
Sometimes the lack of desire

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.719
affects the power that you have.

00:00:29.719 --> 00:00:32.719
Proverbs 2410 says,

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:36.719
If you become discouraged in the day of distress,

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.719
your power or strength will be meager.

00:00:42.119 --> 00:00:50.719
The study note for Philippians 2.13 makes a very sobering but realistic observation that says,

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.719
because of discouragement, personal failings and other factors,

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:04.719
some of God's servants in the past, and we might add, even today, lose their desire to serve,

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:07.719
even to go on living.

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:11.719
That's real talk.

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:18.719
While many of us are experiencing the greatest joys we have ever had because Jehovah's blessings make rich,

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:23.719
we are also facing some of the most troubling times we've ever had,

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:28.719
and sometimes we don't feel so rich.

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:32.719
And that's why our text today is so encouraging.

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:35.719
God is the one.

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:43.719
God is the one who, for the sake of His good pleasure, energizes you,

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:48.719
giving you both the desire and the power to act.

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:53.719
So, God is the one.

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:58.719
When you endure a trial, God is the one.

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:03.719
When you resist temptation, God is the one.

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:09.719
The study note for Philippians 2.13, it concluded in this way.

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:14.719
Paul here shows that when such desire is lacking,

00:02:14.719 --> 00:02:22.719
God is pleased to motivate or energize us, especially when we seek help from Him.

00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:24.719
Now, isn't that encouraging?

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:31.719
It pleases God to energize us as small and insignificant as we are,

00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:36.719
Jehovah takes an interest and is pleased to give us what we need.

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:42.719
But noteworthy is that the context or the text today doesn't say

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:47.719
that Jehovah will get rid of all of our problems by changing our circumstances.

00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:49.719
That would be nice.

00:02:49.719 --> 00:02:55.719
But it does make clear that it is Jehovah's good pleasure to energize us

00:02:55.719 --> 00:03:01.719
and give us the desire to act despite our circumstances.

00:03:01.719 --> 00:03:04.719
Now, how does Jehovah do that?

00:03:04.719 --> 00:03:07.719
Well, in the Greek, this expression energizes.

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:12.719
It's literally acting within you.

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:19.719
So basically, Jehovah can enhance our waning or diminishing power and desire

00:03:19.719 --> 00:03:23.719
with his dynamic, holy spirit.

00:03:23.719 --> 00:03:30.719
That spirit can act within us and cause us to become whatever we need to become

00:03:30.719 --> 00:03:33.719
to accomplish Jehovah's will.

00:03:33.719 --> 00:03:40.719
Now, the numerous Bible examples that highlight the truthfulness of Philippians 2.13.

00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:46.719
I'd like to briefly share just three familiar ones that illustrate how

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:50.719
Jehovah sustained his servants not by changing their circumstances,

00:03:50.719 --> 00:03:57.719
but by acting within them so that they could endure their circumstances.

00:03:57.719 --> 00:04:04.719
First example, 2 Corinthians chapter 12, the Apostle Paul.

00:04:04.719 --> 00:04:10.719
Paul speaks here about a thorn in the flesh that was like an angel of Satan

00:04:10.719 --> 00:04:13.719
that was constantly slapping him.

00:04:13.719 --> 00:04:19.720
In verse 8, Paul begged the Lord about this, that it would depart from him.

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.720
But Jehovah said no.

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.720
Verse 9, Jehovah says,

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:28.720
My undeserved kindness is sufficient for you.

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:35.720
For my power is being made perfect in weakness, your weakness.

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.720
In other words, I'm not going to take away the thorn or change your circumstances,

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:45.720
but I'm going to act within you with my power to help you to endure.

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:50.720
And as a result, look at what Paul concluded in verse 10.

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:56.720
So I take pleasure in weaknesses, in insults, in times of need, in persecutions,

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:02.720
and difficulties for Christ, for when I am weak, my circumstances,

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:07.720
then I am powerful by Jehovah's Holy Spirit.

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:15.540
So question, do you have a thorn in the flesh?

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:22.139
Example 2, 2nd Samuel chapter 4.

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:24.139
Mophibuschef.

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:29.139
Now, if you look in verse 4, when Mophibuschef was 5 years old,

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:34.139
news came from that his father, Jonathan, and his grandfather, King Saul,

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:35.139
had been killed.

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:38.139
The boy's nurse panicked.

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:40.139
She began to carry him.

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:41.139
She was running.

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:46.139
And while fleeing, he fell, and he was crippled.

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:51.139
Now, imagine how this disability must have made Mophibuschef feel.

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:53.139
Maybe they made fun of him because of that.

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:58.139
I wonder how the nurse felt, who may have been the one responsible for dropping him.

00:05:58.139 --> 00:06:02.139
But Jehovah acted within Mophibuschef.

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:06.139
Some years later, King David, out of his great love for Jonathan,

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:11.139
who was Mophibuschef's father, expressed loving kindness to Mophibuschef.

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:16.139
He said to him in 2 Samuel chapter 9 and verse 7,

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:23.139
Do not be afraid, for I will certainly show loyal love to you,

00:06:23.139 --> 00:06:29.139
for the sake of your father, Jonathan, and I will return to you all the land of Saul,

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:35.139
your grandfather, and you will always die at my table.

00:06:35.139 --> 00:06:42.139
Imagine how Mophibuschef's heart must have swelled with appreciation to Jehovah.

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:51.139
He was still cripple, but Jehovah acted within him by giving him the privilege of dining at the King's table.

00:06:51.139 --> 00:06:58.139
Question, do you feel crippled by your health or your circumstances?

00:07:00.389 --> 00:07:07.389
Example 3, 1 Samuel chapter 1, the example of Hannah.

00:07:07.389 --> 00:07:11.389
Hannah had arrived a wife, her name was Pininna.

00:07:11.389 --> 00:07:18.389
Verse 6 of chapter 1 says that Pininna vexed her sorely, sorely,

00:07:18.389 --> 00:07:21.389
because Hannah was barren.

00:07:21.389 --> 00:07:25.389
I wondered about that word vexed, what it really meant.

00:07:25.389 --> 00:07:29.389
Webster's dictionary defined vex as,

00:07:29.389 --> 00:07:33.389
to bring trouble, distress, and agitation to,

00:07:33.389 --> 00:07:41.740
to bring physical distress, to irritate annoy, provoke, persecute, exasperate.

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:44.740
Hannah was quite a mess.

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:49.740
No doubt Hannah, or rather Pininna, was.

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:55.740
No doubt Hannah though suffered this torment frequently in the privacy of her home.

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:58.740
Pininna also publicly vexed her.

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:04.740
No doubt before relatives and friends, while the family attended the festivals at Chilo.

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:07.740
At 1 Samuel chapter 1 verse 10,

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:14.740
it says that Hannah was extremely bitter and wept uncontrollably.

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:16.740
She was depressed.

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:20.740
She prayed, but did Pininna go away?

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:21.740
No she didn't.

00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:23.740
But what did Jehovah do for Hannah?

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:29.180
1 Samuel chapter 1 verse 18 says,

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:34.179
Hannah prayed, let your servant find favor in your eyes,

00:08:34.179 --> 00:08:37.179
and the woman went on her way and ate,

00:08:37.179 --> 00:08:42.179
and her face was no longer downcast.

00:08:42.179 --> 00:08:47.179
One publication says that Hannah transferred the weight of her emotional burden

00:08:47.179 --> 00:08:52.179
to the shoulders infinitely broader and stronger than her own.

00:08:52.179 --> 00:08:55.179
Those of her heavenly father Jehovah.

00:08:55.179 --> 00:08:57.179
Pininna was still Pininna,

00:08:57.179 --> 00:09:02.179
but Jehovah acted within Hannah so that she was able to endure.

00:09:02.179 --> 00:09:06.179
Question, is there a Pininna in your life?

00:09:06.179 --> 00:09:08.179
Are you depressed?

00:09:08.179 --> 00:09:12.179
Now we could go on and on, but I think we get the point.

00:09:12.179 --> 00:09:16.179
Circumstances in life occur over which we have little or no control.

00:09:16.179 --> 00:09:21.179
We may feel weak from a thorn in the flesh, like Paul.

00:09:21.179 --> 00:09:26.179
We may feel crippled by health or circumstances like Mofibosheth.

00:09:26.179 --> 00:09:30.179
We may feel depressed and bitter like Hannah.

00:09:30.179 --> 00:09:35.179
It would be so nice if our problems would just go away,

00:09:35.179 --> 00:09:37.179
but rarely does that happen.

00:09:37.179 --> 00:09:41.179
Sometimes the only solution to our problems is the kingdom.

00:09:41.179 --> 00:09:46.179
We know that many here and in the field are low on power and desire at times,

00:09:46.179 --> 00:09:49.179
and it's hard to just keep going.

00:09:49.179 --> 00:09:54.179
But during those times, turn to Jehovah, like Paul did,

00:09:54.179 --> 00:09:57.179
like Mofibosheth did, like Hannah did.

00:09:57.179 --> 00:10:01.179
Be confident that Jehovah will sustain you.

00:10:01.179 --> 00:10:03.179
He will energize you.

00:10:03.179 --> 00:10:06.179
He will act within you with his powerful Holy Spirit.

00:10:06.179 --> 00:10:14.179
It is his good pleasure to give you the desire and the power to act within your circumstances.

00:10:14.179 --> 00:10:18.179
And as Philippians chapter 2 and verse 13 makes it clear,

00:10:18.179 --> 00:10:22.179
when you sense the power of Jehovah's loving hand,

00:10:22.179 --> 00:10:27.179
you will know for a certainty that he is the one.
