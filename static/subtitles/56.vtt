00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:26.140
We welcome all of you to the January 2019 broadcast.

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:32.700
The 2018 annual meeting of the Watchtower Bible and Track Society of Pennsylvania was held

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.299
on October 6, 2018.

00:00:36.299 --> 00:00:42.859
The program was comprised of spiritually upbuilding talks and encouraging reports.

00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:47.979
It also included faith strengthening interviews, such as one with a member of the governing

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:50.939
body, Brother Garrett Lush.

00:00:50.939 --> 00:00:56.700
Please enjoy the first part of the 2018 annual meeting.

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:05.500
The theme for my opening talk is appreciating our spiritual paradise,

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:11.420
and such a subject is very appropriate on a special occasion like this.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:18.459
When I'll let me ask you this, when were Jehovah's people taken into spiritual captivity

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.180
by Babylon the Great? Well, we know we've learned recently.

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:26.939
It was some time in the 2nd century CE.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:34.459
After the death of the last of the apostles who were acting as a restraint and imitation Christians,

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:43.739
they began to infiltrate the congregation and the ugly baby Christendom was born.

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.099
But now when did that captivity end? Well, we know 1919.

00:01:51.980 --> 00:02:00.700
The year when true anointed Christians came out of captivity and pure worship was restored.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:09.419
And that means, because this is year 2018, Jehovah's people have been set free for 99 years,

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.419
almost 100 years now. Now, what has been the spiritual condition of Jehovah's people during

00:02:15.419 --> 00:02:22.620
these nearly 100 years? Well, our condition has become more and more paradisac.

00:02:23.419 --> 00:02:32.780
And today, it is truly like an exquisite paradise, just like the Garden of Eden was truly an

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:40.060
exquisite physical paradise. In fact, let's compare, let's discuss some similarities

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:45.900
between that original paradise and our spiritual paradise. And we'll see, it is

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:53.900
paradisic, this condition that we're in. Now, here's the first similarity. The Garden of Eden,

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:59.979
of course, had a land. Well, our spiritual paradise has a land. What is the land?

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:08.379
The July 1st, 1995 watchtower said about how in 1919, Jehovah brought the anointed remnant out

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:15.419
of captivity to Baben the Great. And then it says that that anointed group became a new

00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:23.259
born nation. But then it asked, what is the land though? Here's the answer. It is the realm of

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:32.219
activity granted to the newborn nation. A place where Bible prophecies have a modern spiritual

00:03:32.219 --> 00:03:38.780
fulfillment. So if you get that, the realm of activity where the anointed fulfill Bible prophecies.

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:45.340
But now, here's a second similarity. Like the Garden of Eden, our spiritual paradise has

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:50.460
beautiful plants and trees. Now, we certainly know that was true of the Garden of Eden

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:56.219
where Adam and Eve were. But what about in our spiritual paradise? Who are the plants and trees?

00:03:56.939 --> 00:04:03.900
Well, the Bible likens God's people to plants and trees. Here's what First Corinthians 3

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:15.020
9 says, you, God's people, are God's field under cultivation. Or think of Isaiah 61-3. And they,

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:23.019
talking about God's people, will be called big trees of righteousness, the planting of Jehovah.

00:04:23.819 --> 00:04:29.899
And just like those plants and trees in the Garden of Eden, these figurative plants and trees

00:04:30.779 --> 00:04:36.699
bear much fruit, the fruitage of lips, the fruitage of the spirit. And just looking in the

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:43.339
audience, we see many big, beautiful plants and trees sitting out there. And we're happy to have

00:04:43.339 --> 00:04:51.100
you. But now, here is a third similarity. Like the Garden of Eden, our spiritual paradise has a

00:04:51.100 --> 00:05:00.220
abundant food. Jehovah foretold it would exist and a contrast. He said in Isaiah 65-13, look,

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:12.220
my servants will eat, but you will go hungry. And especially today, that contrast is

00:05:12.939 --> 00:05:18.779
more and more evident, isn't it? Between what? The people of the world are being served on the

00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:25.100
table of namens and what we are being served on the table of Jehovah. I mean, they're served

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:33.740
empty calories, junk food, poison food. But we have a smorgasbord, a spiritual thanks, don't we?

00:05:34.459 --> 00:05:41.339
We have these delight, not only nutritious, but delicious things served in our publications,

00:05:41.339 --> 00:05:53.100
meetings, assemblies, conventions, JWU.org, more recently, JWU Broadcasting. This is JWU Broadcasting

00:05:54.139 --> 00:06:01.339
from the world headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses. You can see I'm still working on that.

00:06:09.949 --> 00:06:17.230
Here's a fourth similarity. The Bible tells us that out of the Garden of Eden, a river float.

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:22.509
So it must have been a large river and it divided into four other rivers. Well,

00:06:22.509 --> 00:06:26.990
there must have been abundant refreshing water in the Garden of Eden. Well, likewise in our

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:34.110
spiritual paradise, we have abundant spiritual water. And again, Jehovah foretold it and the contrast.

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:43.470
Isaiah 65-13, Jehovah said, look, my servants will drink, but you will go thirsty.

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:50.829
Makes me think of one young man who was learning the truth. This is what he said, a young man in

00:06:50.829 --> 00:06:57.870
Africa, in his life story in the watchtower. He said, it seemed that my church had been giving me

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:07.790
acid to drink, but now I was freely receiving the water of life. And he was so thankful to be set free

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:14.750
from the Trinity worship of ancestors and so forth. Jehovah gives the invitation at Revelation 22-17

00:07:15.709 --> 00:07:24.750
come and let anyone thirsting come, let anyone who wishes take life's water free. And we know that

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:31.470
water represents all of Jehovah's provisions for gaining everlasting life. Now, here's a fifth

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:39.069
similarity. Like the Garden of Eden, our spiritual paradise is a place that has many harmless

00:07:39.069 --> 00:07:49.310
animals. Now, what do we mean by this? Well, here's what the watchtower said about this or should

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:55.949
say Isaiah's prophecy concerning the scripture. And we should read this first, Isaiah 65-25, here's

00:07:55.949 --> 00:08:05.550
what Jehovah foretold about harmless animals. Isaiah 65-25, the wolf and the lamb will feed together.

00:08:06.509 --> 00:08:13.550
The lion will eat straw just like the bull. And the serpent's food will be dust, they will do no harm,

00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:19.310
not cause any ruin in all my holy mountain says Jehovah. Now, there'll be a literal fulfillment of

00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:25.310
this in the New World, but there's a figurative, a spiritual fulfillment right now. And here's what Isaiah

00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:31.310
prophecy said concerning that scripture we just read, those coming into their spiritual paradise

00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:40.269
make remarkable changes in their lives. The ones that previously had beasts like personalities,

00:08:41.149 --> 00:08:48.110
the books had, with the help of the Holy Spirit, they make drastic changes. And they tame those

00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:53.629
undesirable traits. So that was the explanation of that scripture we just read, see? And what a

00:08:53.629 --> 00:09:04.590
pleasure it is to fellowship with you dear former wolves lions and bears and serpents also.

00:09:05.629 --> 00:09:13.950
Throw that in there. Now, you know, as I said, former, in your former condition, I wouldn't have

00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:19.950
wanted to meet many of you in a dark alley. And you would definitely say that about me if I hadn't

00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:24.990
been raised in the truth. But what a pleasure to have these figurative, harmless animals. Now,

00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:32.509
here's a six comparison. Like the Garden of Eden, our spiritual paradise is a garden that needs

00:09:32.509 --> 00:09:38.269
maintenance. Now, would you say Jehovah's doing maintenance in the spiritual paradise? Well, here's

00:09:38.269 --> 00:09:48.750
Jesus' answer. Look at John chapter 15, John 15 and verse 2, Jesus said, he, Jehovah, takes away

00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:58.190
branch in me, not bearing fruit. And he cleans everyone bearing fruit so that it may bear more fruit.

00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:03.950
Now, if you think of taking away unproductive branches, cleaning productive ones to make a more

00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:10.269
productive, is that not garden maintenance? Well, what about us? Are we expected to do maintenance?

00:10:10.269 --> 00:10:15.470
Well, here's what, um, organized to do Jehovah's will books at. Your faith has brought you into a

00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:24.990
spiritual paradise benefiting from that paradise. You have the responsibility to help maintain it.

00:10:25.629 --> 00:10:33.070
And then the book went on to say by applying Bible counsel. We help maintain our spiritual paradise.

00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:39.950
Here's one more similarity. Number seven, our spiritual paradise, like the Garden of Eden,

00:10:40.669 --> 00:10:47.710
has boundaries. Now, regarding the Garden of Eden, here's what the inside book said,

00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:55.870
it seems to have been an enclosed area, bounded, no doubt, by natural barriers. And then it

00:10:55.870 --> 00:11:01.309
went on to say it had an entrance on the eastern side. And that, of course, was where the cherubs

00:11:01.309 --> 00:11:07.629
were placed to block the entrance. Well, what about our spiritual paradise? What are the boundaries?

00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:15.070
Well, here's a few examples. First Corinthians 5-11, stop keeping company with anyone who gets

00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:20.110
disfellowshipped. We're separate, a boundary. Revelation 18-4, get out of the bottom of the great.

00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:29.309
Separate, a boundary. What about John 17-14? We must be no part of the world as Jesus was no part

00:11:29.309 --> 00:11:36.590
of the world. Separate, a boundary. But interestingly, Satan the devil was able to lure

00:11:37.549 --> 00:11:45.149
Adam and Eve out of their beautiful paradise home. And he's trying very hard to lure every

00:11:45.149 --> 00:11:51.549
one of us here, out of the boundaries of our wonderful spiritual paradise. But we're determined,

00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:56.750
we're not going to let that happen. But there we have seven similarities. And I'm sure you can

00:11:56.750 --> 00:12:04.190
think of others. But truly, the situation we're in, the condition as Jehovah's people is paradoxic.

00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:13.710
And it is proof. The reality of this spiritual paradise is proof that a literal paradise will,

00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:23.789
likewise, soon, become reality. But now, moving ahead in our program, we're going to have a privilege

00:12:23.789 --> 00:12:33.149
to look at a video. The title of it courage to stand firm in a time of trial. And our video will

00:12:33.149 --> 00:12:40.350
be narrated by Brother Rick Ford, who serves as the overseer of the headquarters museum department

00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:48.110
at Warwick. And you're going to enjoy this. Brother Ford is going to really tell you about something

00:12:48.190 --> 00:12:52.190
you're going to look forward to visiting. So let's look at the monitors, please.

00:12:55.360 --> 00:13:06.399
Courage to stand firm in a time of trial. That's the story of the Bible students from 1914 to 1919.

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:15.200
And the theme of a new exhibit at World Headquarters. The tests they faced in those

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:21.840
few pivotal years are part of our spiritual heritage that can strengthen our courage now.

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:35.379
And for what lies ahead? In the years, just before 1914, anticipation was high.

00:13:36.419 --> 00:13:45.860
Since 1876, Charles Tay's Russell had published that the Gentile Times would end in October 1914.

00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:53.539
Many believed it would mean the end of their preaching work, and they're being taken to heaven to rule

00:13:53.539 --> 00:14:01.620
with Christ. The Bible students spread their message by every means possible. Tracks, pamphlets,

00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:10.980
and then in 1886, with the plan of the ages, the first book in the Millennial Dawn series later

00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:19.059
called Studies in the Scriptures. In December 1911, Brother Russell embarked on an around the

00:14:19.059 --> 00:14:30.899
world tour. And he went on an 8,000 mile transcontinental train tour in 1913, where 1914 came,

00:14:31.539 --> 00:14:37.379
so did a new way to expand the work, the photo drama of creation.

00:14:47.139 --> 00:14:53.539
The Bible's message was now reaching millions. With 1914 turnout as they had hoped.

00:14:56.399 --> 00:15:04.559
On June 28, Austria's Archduke Ferdinand was assassinated, triggering the start of the Great War.

00:15:05.519 --> 00:15:09.759
The end of the Gentile Times seemed to be fulfilling expectations.

00:15:11.679 --> 00:15:23.039
We held a convention at Columbus, Ohio. I recall how that on June 28, right in the midst of that

00:15:23.039 --> 00:15:32.399
convention, why there was a shock fired that was heard around the world. When we read the newspaper,

00:15:32.399 --> 00:15:40.879
we said, aha, there it is, there it is. The Gentile Times are drawing to their close.

00:15:43.149 --> 00:15:51.149
But 1914 brought unexpected trials that would test the Bible students' faith as never before.

00:15:52.110 --> 00:16:02.110
The year 1914 came and it went. Contrary to expectations, the heavenly reward did not come.

00:16:04.029 --> 00:16:10.269
As they wondered how much longer they would need to preach, they confronted a devastating turn

00:16:10.269 --> 00:16:19.789
of events. Brother Russell died suddenly on October 31, 1916. We did not know what to do.

00:16:20.669 --> 00:16:26.990
It was so unexpected and yet Russell had tried to prepare us for it. What would we do?

00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:35.070
The first shock of our loss of CT Russell was the worst. For those first few days, our future was a

00:16:35.070 --> 00:16:43.629
blank wall. In time, some felt that all that God saw fit to reveal had come through Brother Russell

00:16:43.629 --> 00:16:51.230
and that the revelation of truth had now ended. After Joseph F. Rutherford was selected as the

00:16:51.230 --> 00:17:02.429
new president, Decent arose among the society's directors. On July 17, 1917, the tension exploded

00:17:02.429 --> 00:17:08.829
with the publication of the finished mystery, the seventh volume of studies in the scriptures

00:17:08.910 --> 00:17:15.710
based largely on Brother Russell's earlier writings. On that morning, a lengthy debate erupted,

00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:21.869
right in the Bethel dining room. Vicious charges were hurled against Rutherford and his oversight.

00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:30.269
Although four society directors were soon dismissed from Bethel, they soon began spreading their

00:17:30.269 --> 00:17:36.750
opposition by an extensive speaking and letter writing campaign that threatened to divide the

00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:43.710
organization. To just just organize the congregation they try to put Brother Russell's book.

00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:50.029
So my uncle, he said, well, this didn't happen Brother Russell's day. I'm going to quit the whole

00:17:50.029 --> 00:17:55.710
business and just read Brother Russell's books. I said, well, I'm not going to quit the society.

00:17:55.710 --> 00:18:02.670
I was convinced that the society's God's arrangement. Another threat soon emerged.

00:18:03.309 --> 00:18:10.190
The finished mysteries distribution sparked renewed opposition from religious and political leaders.

00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:19.069
The book was banned first in Canada and then in the United States. How did the Bible students

00:18:19.069 --> 00:18:26.670
respond? They launched a courageous campaign to distribute Kingdom News 1, 2, and 3.

00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:33.950
These boldly exposed clergy abuses and defended the Bible students' scriptural position.

00:18:35.309 --> 00:18:40.109
But with war still raging, the next challenge demanded attention.

00:18:41.710 --> 00:18:46.990
In many countries, brothers took a neutral stand as conscientious objectors.

00:18:48.910 --> 00:18:51.470
We were put into cells to look more like dungeons.

00:18:51.549 --> 00:18:59.789
Due to our refusal to undergo military drill, a number of us were taken to a secluded part of the

00:18:59.789 --> 00:19:05.309
prison yard. Lined up, there were a number of men in uniform with canes in their hands.

00:19:05.869 --> 00:19:11.710
One by one, we were ordered to run the length of the court. If the pace was too slow,

00:19:11.710 --> 00:19:17.470
we were seized and dragged the distance and subjected to lashes on the back and legs.

00:19:17.789 --> 00:19:24.910
Beyond those persecuted for refusing military service, others endured physical abuse

00:19:24.910 --> 00:19:31.710
instigated by the clergy because of their courageous preaching. Any uncertainty our brothers

00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:42.190
may have felt was only intensified by what happened next. On May 7, 1918, federal arrest warrants

00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:48.349
were issued for Joseph Rutherford and seven associates. They were charged with causing

00:19:48.349 --> 00:19:55.309
insubordination, disloyalty, and refusal of duty in the military and naval forces of the United

00:19:55.309 --> 00:20:04.430
States. A month later, they were pronounced guilty and given concurrent sentences ranging from

00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:12.500
10 to 20 years in a federal penitentiary. The Brooklyn tabernacle was sold,

00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:20.819
and remaining operations were transferred back to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. These were dark and

00:20:20.819 --> 00:20:32.799
confusing times, but Jehovah would not abandon his courageous people. On March 26, 1919, brother

00:20:32.799 --> 00:20:40.480
Rutherford and his associates were released. Seeking Jehovah's will, brother Rutherford scheduled

00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:50.240
a public meeting in Los Angeles, California on May 4, 1919. It was a test where people still

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:58.240
interested in the Bible's message. Within 20 minutes after the doors opened, the auditorium was

00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:06.079
filled to capacity. About 3,500 showed up, and another 600 were turned away with the promise

00:21:06.079 --> 00:21:13.519
that an overflow meeting would be held the following day. An additional 1,500 showed up to hear

00:21:13.519 --> 00:21:23.539
the second talk. There was clearly much more work to do. Bethel operations were moved back to Brooklyn.

00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:32.019
Plans were made immediately for the 1919 Cedar Point Convention, which was held four months

00:21:32.019 --> 00:21:41.490
later, a turning point that reignited the preaching work. New tools, including the Golden Age

00:21:41.490 --> 00:21:49.170
magazine, were released. A service department was established at Bethel. Service directors were

00:21:49.170 --> 00:21:58.259
appointed to organize preaching in each congregation, and as we now understand, the faithful and discrete

00:21:58.259 --> 00:22:09.059
slave was commissioned to feed God's flock. Isaiah chapter 46 verse 8 says, remember this, and take

00:22:09.059 --> 00:22:24.559
courage. Remember how these faithful ones preached an unpopular message. How they move forward,

00:22:24.559 --> 00:22:35.619
despite unrealized expectations. How they stayed loyal to God's organization when others did

00:22:35.619 --> 00:22:45.869
not. How they suffered when staying neutral in the world's wars. Remember their courageous

00:22:45.869 --> 00:23:10.690
example and take courage now and in the days ahead. Thank you very much brother Ford for

00:23:10.690 --> 00:23:18.289
sharing that very interesting theocratic history concerning our spiritual predecessors,

00:23:18.289 --> 00:23:26.049
the Bible students, and you've made us very eager to visit our new museum exhibit.

00:23:26.930 --> 00:23:32.529
But now we're going to get to enjoy another video treat. Brother Garrett Loesch of the

00:23:32.529 --> 00:23:40.529
governing body is going to share with us some fascinating experiences from Eastern Europe.

00:23:45.309 --> 00:23:55.150
I was serving at the Austria branch from about mid-70s to 1990. We had a small department that was

00:23:55.150 --> 00:24:01.710
assigned to help certain countries, Eastern Europe, and that included visiting the brothers on the

00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:08.349
ban, bringing them spiritual food, having secret meetings with them, and also the strengths

00:24:08.349 --> 00:24:16.750
in the local organization that was exposed to persecution and ban. We would print books on

00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:24.750
Bible paper and miniature size. This way more books or literature could be taken to these countries.

00:24:25.150 --> 00:24:31.789
The couriers they transported literature to these countries in their own private cars,

00:24:31.789 --> 00:24:42.059
this way hundreds of books could be transported. At the border if a courier would be found transporting

00:24:42.059 --> 00:24:48.859
literature, they would interrogate the driver, but these brothers were trained. They knew what to

00:24:48.859 --> 00:24:55.740
say to protect the work and not give away any secrets. Usually after a day or two days,

00:24:56.299 --> 00:25:02.539
the officials would let them go back home to their home country, but not with their car. They

00:25:02.539 --> 00:25:09.900
had to have public transportation because the cars would be confiscated. But the brothers had

00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:16.859
the spirit of sacrifice they were willing to. But the majority got through and actually every year

00:25:16.859 --> 00:25:24.940
thousands of miniature books were transported secretly to Eastern Europe. So it was not just a matter

00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:33.500
of us being so clever in hiding things, getting it to the brothers, but we were always fully convinced

00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:41.980
and had evidence that it was Jehovah's Holy Spirit that helped us also with transported stencils

00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:49.099
for local production so that in their countries they could reproduce the same material with

00:25:49.099 --> 00:25:56.460
mammographing machines. In most cases, the mammographing machines were transported secretly

00:25:56.460 --> 00:26:04.700
by the couriers. The other method was to build it within the country. I remember there was a brother

00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:11.339
that was a very skilled engineer and under his direction. They decided to build it themselves,

00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:18.779
so they were self-made, offset printing presses. The brothers had a number of underground

00:26:18.779 --> 00:26:25.980
printeries that they had dug out under their own homes. In many cases, the brothers had to do what

00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:34.539
they did during the night because in communist countries, they had to go during the day to a factory

00:26:34.619 --> 00:26:41.819
or whatever else and do some secular work. But it testifies to the great spirit of sacrifice that

00:26:41.819 --> 00:26:50.460
the brothers showed to forfeit so much of their private life as a family to do at night the printing

00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:59.660
of the spiritual food. Some had only a few hours of sleep, but they left Jehovah and the brothers so

00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:09.869
much that they did it. There was no kingdom hall. The brothers had the secret meetings in private

00:27:09.869 --> 00:27:16.430
homes and they would not all come at the same time because if the neighbors would see certain

00:27:16.430 --> 00:27:24.509
persons all the time going to a specific house, there could be suspicions. And every week they had

00:27:24.589 --> 00:27:31.710
the meetings in a different home of the brothers and this helped to protect the work so that it could

00:27:31.710 --> 00:27:40.269
be kept secret. Singing was very important for the brothers and they didn't have to have a song

00:27:40.269 --> 00:27:47.390
in hand. They knew the texts of the song by heart and immediately saying a number they could

00:27:47.390 --> 00:27:55.069
sing the song that affected the heart, the emotions of the brothers so they were strengthened in their

00:27:55.069 --> 00:28:03.789
determination to be faithful. A lot of pressure was on the brothers in Romania. The communist party

00:28:03.789 --> 00:28:10.990
they tried to so distrust among the brothers, meeting with them separately and telling some

00:28:11.069 --> 00:28:17.950
brothers one thing, telling other brothers something else. Sometimes it has happened that an

00:28:17.950 --> 00:28:25.630
official posed as an interested person and was clever enough to disguise that and pretend to make

00:28:25.630 --> 00:28:33.230
progress in the truth not only to the point of getting baptized but even to the point of becoming

00:28:33.230 --> 00:28:41.069
an elder but he was in reality an agent of the secret police with the aim to find out everything

00:28:41.069 --> 00:28:51.309
about the organization. So it did lead in one case that brothers started to distrust someone that

00:28:51.309 --> 00:28:58.509
was actually appointed by headquarters and these brothers then separated from the organization that

00:28:58.509 --> 00:29:07.710
Jehovah used and some of them were separated for not just a few years but for decades and they

00:29:07.710 --> 00:29:15.630
were a large number up to 5,000 publishers. They continued to meet together they were preaching and

00:29:15.630 --> 00:29:22.990
using material that they had left over from earlier years but they hardly got any new material to

00:29:22.990 --> 00:29:28.349
study because they were not in touch with the organization that was used for headquarters.

00:29:29.869 --> 00:29:37.789
Attempts to bring the brothers back into the organization were made from time to time but it seemed

00:29:37.789 --> 00:29:46.109
that the brothers from the separated organization did not have sufficient trust but when we

00:29:46.109 --> 00:29:53.950
presented to the leader of the separated group that one from the governing body would come

00:29:55.390 --> 00:30:02.349
he was happy about that and he had enough trust in that case to agree that we should have a

00:30:02.349 --> 00:30:11.150
meeting and seriously talk about reunification and so from the separated group there were

00:30:11.230 --> 00:30:18.670
brother Albu who was the leader and four of his main elders and from our side there was brother

00:30:18.670 --> 00:30:28.430
Jeris our translator and I was part of that group also there were several from the country committee

00:30:28.430 --> 00:30:37.359
of Romania. I remember the first night there was a lot of accusations about what the others had

00:30:37.359 --> 00:30:47.230
done and not done which did not create the best spirit and we mainly listened but everybody agreed

00:30:47.230 --> 00:30:54.029
to meet another night and the second night obviously Jehovah wanted the brothers to unite again

00:30:54.829 --> 00:31:01.390
and the whole spirit was different and the brothers talked the matters over and clarified some

00:31:01.390 --> 00:31:07.710
misunderstandings and at the end of the second evening I remember the leader of the separate

00:31:07.710 --> 00:31:14.509
group brother Albu said let's do it because if we don't do it now we may never have another

00:31:14.509 --> 00:31:26.299
opportunity again and so the decision was made it doesn't happen every day the five thousand

00:31:26.299 --> 00:31:36.900
brothers come back to the organization from then on all the practical things were put in place

00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:43.059
to accomplish this reunification they were asked to merge with our congregations

00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:52.579
and it also took a lot of humility on their part but they were willing to do it so they were

00:31:53.380 --> 00:32:03.619
really brothers in their heart and loved the truth and so the reunification was accomplished and

00:32:03.619 --> 00:32:12.460
it was a wonderful victory for Jehovah and against Satan reflecting on the experience with the

00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:20.859
brothers in Romania we can see there could always be misunderstandings among humans and there could

00:32:20.859 --> 00:32:29.980
always be even legitimate complaints about misconduct of some responsible brothers but the

00:32:30.059 --> 00:32:37.420
important thing is never to lose trust that this is Jehovah's organization that's where Jehovah's

00:32:37.420 --> 00:32:45.660
blessing is Jehovah sees it all Jehovah uses his Holy Spirit to keep the organization together

00:32:46.380 --> 00:32:53.099
and what he wants to have accomplished will happen and if we work with the Holy Spirit then

00:32:53.180 --> 00:33:24.130
Jehovah will bless our efforts and it will be successful to his praise thank you so much brother

00:33:24.130 --> 00:33:32.930

conducted by brother Samuel heard of the governing body and he's gonna interview four brothers

00:45:24.690 --> 00:45:30.849
who have a lot to tell us but he's going to his best to hold him down in 19 minutes look at

00:45:30.849 --> 00:45:40.880
the monitors please we have four brothers with us brother Stephen Hardy is serving in the Britain

00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:48.159
branch brother Lawrence Shep is serving in Peru brother Riner Thompson's current assignment

00:45:48.159 --> 00:45:55.199
is in the Dominican Republic and last alphabetically is brother Leon Weaver who is serving on the

00:45:55.199 --> 00:46:01.760
United States branch committee all four of these brothers have at least two things in common

00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:09.920
first they've all served as the branch committee coordinator of their respective branches for

00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:18.880
a number of years and second all four have hit a milestone in life according to Psalm 1910

00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:27.920
there these brothers are identified as being especially strong why so because their lifespan

00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:35.360
is cresting 80 years of age it takes extra vitality and stamina to still be walking and talking

00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:43.440
at that age and to still be making sense believe me I know I asked a retired 80 the governing body

00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:53.360
said not until you lose it I said well brother Weaver what did all four of you find out on May 26

00:46:53.360 --> 00:47:01.760
2014 all branch committees got a letter from the governing body and that letter told us about a new

00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:09.599
policy and that new policy was that once a branch committee coordinator reaches the age of 80

00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:16.960
he would not be able to serve as branch committee coordinator anymore but the branch committee

00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:22.719
would look for a younger brother who could qualify to do that then recommend the younger brother

00:47:22.719 --> 00:47:28.800
to be the branch committee coordinator would any of you like to describe your first thoughts when

00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:38.000
you read that new policy well yes brother heard I remember some words of my dad he worked on

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:45.440
the circuit into his senior years but he would tell me say now son if you see that I'm starting to

00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:54.400
lose it you be sure to tell me and get me to stop oftentimes we don't realize age takes a toll

00:47:54.400 --> 00:48:01.440
on her effectiveness remember the younger man looking how far would I be able to do this work

00:48:02.079 --> 00:48:08.960
that's how well maybe at 65 I should step off from being the coordinator that everybody retired

00:48:08.960 --> 00:48:16.880
at 65 at 65 I felt pretty good so I went on to 70 when 70 was drifting by I felt pretty good

00:48:16.880 --> 00:48:23.119
went on to 75 and I know if that new policy hadn't come out I'd have probably been sitting at the 85

00:48:23.119 --> 00:48:31.280
or who knows where but really for the benefit of the work we need to have younger men experience

00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:37.440
yes but younger and vigorous for the benefit of the work and for the benefit of those with whom

00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:45.760
we we work on the committee much of the branch work especially with the work of the coordinator

00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:53.599
recently has to do with modern technology so as a result of this when I was serving as coordinator

00:48:53.599 --> 00:48:59.920
I had to use a younger spiritually minded brother to keep me up to speed as it were to what was

00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:11.840
required so besides the aging process when the changes came I had no doubt that it was Jehovah's

00:49:11.840 --> 00:49:21.119
decision and so then for me I was very happy to accept the change without any questions or any

00:49:21.119 --> 00:49:27.280
doubts and then there was an additional paragraph in that policy letter that said that if a coordinate

00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:32.880
is not yet 80 years of age but he feels that now will be the best time for a younger brother

00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:39.760
to take on that responsibility then his request should be considered well I was just 75 at that time

00:49:40.559 --> 00:49:45.920
but I began to realize in the coming years after a couple of years with the Britain branch

00:49:45.920 --> 00:49:51.920
construction and relocation project I realized that the responsibilities would become even more

00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:58.159
intense and because of the major organizational adjustments that we'd have I realized there

00:49:58.159 --> 00:50:04.639
would be good to request a younger brother to take over I was just 79 when that change took place

00:50:04.639 --> 00:50:09.039
that was a very modest thing to do thank you brothers for your comments

00:50:10.800 --> 00:50:17.599
I can't help myself I have to ask this what were your wives reactions to the new policy

00:50:17.679 --> 00:50:25.840
did they leap for joy don't don't answer that second question well Rudy thought it was a loving

00:50:26.719 --> 00:50:34.480
arrangement for us and actually she she thought that it would be best for her and for me

00:50:35.599 --> 00:50:43.280
and I agreed with her in our case for the herd the dance was years we've been surprised by many

00:50:43.920 --> 00:50:52.880
reassignments and genius always been 100% cooperative with all theocratic assignments

00:50:54.079 --> 00:51:00.960
but as assignments would come she would pack or unpack whatever was the order of the moment

00:51:01.599 --> 00:51:09.280
with the new policy she accepted it wholeheartedly and she was happy she didn't have to pack or

00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:16.239
unpack on this one and Anne's reaction first of all was what are you going to do so she realized

00:51:16.239 --> 00:51:21.440
that I'm always involved with my work and I'd have plenty to do but she was fully supportive of

00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:28.480
the arrangement you know that was the same with Olympia of course she was surprised we were all

00:51:28.480 --> 00:51:36.719
surprised but from the very moment just a few seconds after I told her of the change she accepted

00:51:37.599 --> 00:51:44.800
and she was willing to cooperate it because as she said she knew that this was direction

00:51:44.800 --> 00:51:52.000
by the faithful slave Solomon asked who can find a capable wife all four of you just answered

00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:59.679
that question beautifully I'm sure you remember the account of Marceli in 2nd Samuel chapter 19

00:52:00.559 --> 00:52:05.920
he was very helpful to King David David offered for him to be part of the royal court

00:52:06.559 --> 00:52:15.519
but Marceli had now turned 80 years of age he declined because he knew he would not be as useful

00:52:15.519 --> 00:52:23.440
in the days ahead instead the privilege went to Kimham a younger man did that account come to your

00:52:23.440 --> 00:52:29.199
mind with this policy change I was convinced that the governing body was probably using that

00:52:29.760 --> 00:52:37.760
to consider their new changes or policy I was 80 years of age I was still strong I was still

00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:44.719
vigorous but I do have to admit that it crossed my mind many times that it's going to come a time

00:52:44.719 --> 00:52:52.079
chef when you're going to have to relinquish your privileges to somebody younger and so then when

00:52:52.480 --> 00:53:00.239
the change came I accepted it as coming from Jehovah and I had no doubts that it was a direction

00:53:00.239 --> 00:53:06.800
of the faithful slave yes I did think of Barzilli but then my mind went to his replacement Kimham

00:53:07.360 --> 00:53:11.920
and I realized that on our branch committee we had several younger brothers who were like Kim

00:53:11.920 --> 00:53:21.039
ham's so I was a piece with that arrangement I must admit brother heard that I reviewed this case

00:53:21.039 --> 00:53:31.440
of Barzilli but there was one thing about what he said and did that I didn't agree with he said

00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:39.280
that he'd like to go back to his hometown and die rather I thought I'll use my energies as much

00:53:39.280 --> 00:53:46.960
as I can and other activities connected with our assignment I'm sure that is the spirit of all four

00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:54.480
of you at what age did you dedicate your life to Jehovah and describe some of the privileges you

00:53:54.480 --> 00:54:04.079
have enjoyed since then at 13 I was baptized by 17 I was in regular pioneer work at 21 by

00:54:04.079 --> 00:54:10.960
faithful wife Jeannie and I graduated from Gillia and were assigned to Puerto Rico we went into

00:54:10.960 --> 00:54:16.320
the missionary work in Puerto Rico for about a year and a half to learn the language and then we had

00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:24.960
the privilege of circuit work later the governing body invited us invited me to take up the

00:54:25.679 --> 00:54:33.199
branch committee work in Belize when it used to be called British Honduras and from there we

00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:43.199
were transferred to Nicaragua as branch committee and from there we were deported in the revolution

00:54:43.199 --> 00:54:49.599
in our years to Costa Rica had the privilege to work with by the chef for six years in Costa

00:54:49.599 --> 00:54:58.800
Rican the branch committee and it was also branch building going on at that time and then we've

00:54:58.800 --> 00:55:06.159
been for the last 30 years privileged to serve with the Dominican Republic branch committee

00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:14.079
over the last eight years it's been our privilege to serve as headquarter's representative and branch

00:55:14.079 --> 00:55:21.920
visits and getting to know so many faithful and hardworking beseilites in different parts of the

00:55:21.920 --> 00:55:30.320
world it truly it's a wonderful organization to be working with and with me brother heard I was

00:55:30.320 --> 00:55:41.039
17 when I was baptized and in 1957 I started to regular pioneer and 1965 the governing body

00:55:41.039 --> 00:55:51.840
appointed me to be a traveling overseer and Ruby and I traveled for 12 years to 1977 and in 1977

00:55:51.840 --> 00:56:01.440
they called us into Bethel so we've been at Bethel for the last 41 years and about 23 years ago they

00:56:01.440 --> 00:56:09.440
invited me to visit other branches throughout the globe and we've had quite a interesting and

00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:14.880
encouraging time doing that and we've had the privilege of you being a helper to the service

00:56:14.880 --> 00:56:21.840
committee as a governing body since 1992 you've racked up quite a life of dedicated service

00:56:22.639 --> 00:56:36.400
I was baptized at the age of 19 I took up the full-time service in 1958 in 1960 I was appointed

00:56:36.480 --> 00:56:45.440
circuit overseer I served in parts of Ontario Quebec and then while serving there I was assigned to

00:56:45.440 --> 00:56:53.280
North West Canada which included part of Alaska and after getting there only four months or so

00:56:54.639 --> 00:57:01.519
we were called to Brooklyn to attend the newly formed the kingdom ministry school

00:57:02.480 --> 00:57:09.119
during our visit at Brooklyn brother nor talked to some of us Canadians and he asked us would you

00:57:09.119 --> 00:57:16.400
be willing to accept a missionary assignment without going to Gilead or this was a marvelous

00:57:16.400 --> 00:57:25.840
opportunity and I was accepted and later assigned to Nicaragua so just after a couple years I

00:57:25.840 --> 00:57:32.400
wanted to get married I wrote and brother nor had kind of softened his opinion about getting married

00:57:32.400 --> 00:57:41.280
at that time so 55 years ago I married Olympia and we've been serving together in several countries we

00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:50.400
were assigned to Costa Rica where we served together for 27 years and on the second of October we

00:57:50.480 --> 00:58:00.239
just completed another 25 years of serving under the Peru branch I also considered a tremendous

00:58:00.239 --> 00:58:08.159
privilege for having been assigned the privilege of visiting other branches and sharing encouragement

00:58:08.159 --> 00:58:15.360
with them and that I've been doing for a little bit more than 20 years I'm getting tired out

00:58:15.440 --> 00:58:20.400
just listening to the work you brothers have done over the years brother harder your story please

00:58:20.960 --> 00:58:28.400
well I dedicated my life to Jehovah when I was 11 years old and then I started pioneering at 18

00:58:28.400 --> 00:58:34.559
then special pioneered and when I was just 22 my wife and I were invited into the circuit work

00:58:35.360 --> 00:58:42.559
and then in 1963 we got a surprise we were invited to Gilead and from Gilead assigned to Burundi

00:58:42.559 --> 00:58:48.480
in Africa well we never heard of Burundi so immediately we went together a year book to find out

00:58:48.480 --> 00:58:53.920
how many publishers there were in Burundi we looked down the list but Burundi it wasn't even on the

00:58:53.920 --> 00:59:01.039
list so we suddenly realized we were going into virgin territory but sadly the authorities in

00:59:01.039 --> 00:59:07.119
Burundi were not happy about that and after just four months had to leave the country and we were

00:59:07.119 --> 00:59:14.000
reassigned to Uganda and then we served there for 10 years and again there were difficulties in

00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:20.559
Uganda and so we were reassigned this time to Kotevoix and we served there for another 10 years

00:59:21.280 --> 00:59:30.639
but then my wife got some medical problems and we had to return to Britain in 1983 and after

00:59:30.719 --> 00:59:38.239
some years she died but then a little later there was a commuter Bethel sister in London Bethel

00:59:38.800 --> 00:59:44.880
and her desire was to become a regular Bethelite and she knew the only way to do that according to her

00:59:44.880 --> 00:59:51.519
was to marry a Bethel brother well I found her personality very attractive and what's more she was

00:59:51.519 --> 00:59:59.360
a really spiritual person so I succumbed and so Anne and I we've been serving happily in London

00:59:59.360 --> 01:00:06.400
Bethel since 1989 and like the other brothers I've had the privilege of serving as a headquarters

01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:14.159
representatives and so we visited some 60 branches and have thoroughly enjoyed that thank you for that

01:00:14.159 --> 01:00:22.719
brief overview of your lives according to my notes all told brother Hardy has served as a branch

01:00:22.719 --> 01:00:29.599
committee member for 38 years for the last 19 years he has been the coordinator of the

01:00:29.599 --> 01:00:36.880
Britain branch brother ship according to my calculations has served as a member of a branch

01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:45.039
committee for 52 years and 48 of those years as the coordinator to a branch committee brother

01:00:45.039 --> 01:00:52.239
Thompson has been serving as a branch committee member for some 50 years with 44 of those years as

01:00:52.239 --> 01:00:59.599
the coordinator of a branch committee some of you who are newer to the organization might not realize

01:00:59.599 --> 01:01:07.679
it but there was not an official branch committee in the United States until April the first 2001

01:01:09.199 --> 01:01:15.679
brother weaver was appointed as a branch committee member from its inception so that is now

01:01:15.679 --> 01:01:23.920
17 years as a member of that branch committee and he has served as the coordinator for the past 11

01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:31.760
years being the coordinator of a branch committee is a full time job and then some so I'm sure

01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:39.360
everyone is wondering what your new assignment entails brother Hardy well I work in the branch committee

01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:45.679
office and I do some proofreading of letters to other branches and to the different committees of

01:01:45.679 --> 01:01:51.599
the governing body I'm one of the three brothers assigned from the branch can be assigned to work in

01:01:51.599 --> 01:02:00.400
the service department and one of my assignments is to include shepherding I've had a privilege of

01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:07.920
calling personally the 97 traveling overseers and talking to them and to many of their wives

01:02:08.559 --> 01:02:15.599
I've been able to call the 52 field missionaries and I've been able to visit personally everyone

01:02:15.599 --> 01:02:25.039
of the Bethel family I have a goal we have 47 very faithful special pioneers that are not able to do

01:02:25.039 --> 01:02:31.760
as much as they used to so I'm starting to call them and my goal is by the end of this calendar year

01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:36.719

01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:44.159
the area of what we call bread which is branch a real estate desk they've also given me the privilege

01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:50.559
having participated in the construction of two branches to help the younger brothers take

01:02:50.559 --> 01:02:57.440
advantage of the training programs that we have in place for them brother heard all of us are still

01:02:57.440 --> 01:03:02.320
on the branch committee and there's still much work to do in connection with the branch committee

01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:11.760
we have shepherding to do of traveling overseers Bethel family members we also still give our convention

01:03:12.559 --> 01:03:20.000
assignments we will do circuit assemblies and myself personally I like to increase my

01:03:20.559 --> 01:03:27.679
field service time with my congregation and with my wife Ruby thank you brothers for your

01:03:27.679 --> 01:03:34.480
many decades of loyal dedicated service to Jehovah and to Kingdom interest and along with so many

01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:41.599
long-time faithful ones it is heartwarming to hear that you fully embrace the decision of the

01:03:41.599 --> 01:03:49.599
faithful slave even if it means relinquishing a privilege of service but that in no way has

01:03:49.599 --> 01:03:56.880
any bearing on your zeal energy and enthusiasm for the Lord's work the governing body applies

01:03:56.880 --> 01:04:04.639
