00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:16.820
My name is David, that's me there, no, not him in front, that's Mark, that's me, the

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.059
one on the ladder.

00:00:19.059 --> 00:00:23.019
My relationship with Jehovah is the most precious thing in my life.

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:29.339
I have always worked hard in the congregation, happy to serve my brothers and sisters.

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:34.380
But something happened that tested my integrity.

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:40.700
For a long time, it had been my goal to become a ministerial servant.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:47.500
Just think of how much more I could give to the congregation, to Jehovah.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:59.719
The travelling overseas was visiting our congregation and I felt confident that I would be appointed.

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:05.439
At the next meeting, a special announcement was made to the congregation.

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:13.439
We are very happy to announce the appointment of a new ministerial servant in our congregation.

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:33.879
Brother Mark, I wasn't being appointed as a ministerial servant, how could they make him one?

00:01:33.879 --> 00:01:37.719
He's only 19.

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:44.159
I was too consumed with my thoughts and emotions to pay attention to the rest of the meeting.

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:50.120
Afterwards, I couldn't even bring myself to congratulate Mark.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:02:21.900
I never thought I would feel this way about a decision made by the elders.

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.099
I just don't get it.

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:27.659
What does Mark have that I don't?

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:31.930
How could they overlook me?

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:39.090
He didn't take much to remind me of my disappointment and to make me feel bitter.

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.490
Every time I walked into the kingdom hall, those feelings intensified.

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:50.490
Being there was a constant reminder of what seemed to be injustice.

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:55.449
What was the point in working so hard if no one noticed?

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:59.930
I didn't know how much longer I could face it.

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.449
I considered moving to a different congregation.

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:08.849
Somewhere I would feel appreciated and could serve Jehovah better.

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:34.719
I was torn into a decision like that required playful thought, injustice, envy.

00:03:34.719 --> 00:03:40.800
The Bible speaks about a man who experienced similar emotions to mine.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:05:05.069
I decided to read about him.

00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:12.029
I couldn't imagine hurting my brother, but I was envying him.

00:05:12.029 --> 00:05:18.699
Just like Cain, sin was crowding at my door.

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:25.939
And I get the mastery of it.

00:05:25.939 --> 00:05:32.019
I had to act immediately before my feelings of envy could fester into something that could

00:05:32.019 --> 00:05:35.980
damage my relationship with my brother and Jehovah.

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:53.470
He told me how much he looked up to me, respected me.

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:57.790
It was my example that encouraged him to reach out.

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:05.149
I realized then that my work in the congregation did not go unnoticed.

00:06:05.189 --> 00:06:17.529
I was resolved to use this opportunity to prove my integrity and motives for serving Jehovah faithfully.

00:06:17.529 --> 00:06:23.579
Time flew by as I kept busy in the congregation.

00:06:23.579 --> 00:06:33.740
Now I have the privilege of serving as a ministerial servant alongside Mark.

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:41.500
I regret how I reacted and how that affected my joy in serving Jehovah.

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:46.939
I'm so grateful I didn't let the roots of envy grow in my heart.
