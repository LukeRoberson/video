00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:09.679
What do we have here in the letter that Paul wrote under inspiration to the congregation in Philippi a letter that breathes love and

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.079
That motivates us to increase in displaying godly joy

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:22.320
Now that may not always be easy because life in this system of things can be very difficult

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.260
In fact, perhaps you or your family or close friends are facing a galaeth-like

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:30.579
Challenge at this moment

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:38.820
But think a little bit more about the context and who wrote this letter to the Philippians where we're told to always rejoice

00:00:39.939 --> 00:00:41.939
It was the Apostle Paul

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.659
Do you know where Paul was when he wrote the letter?

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.259
Not in any comfortable office. He was in a prison likely in Rome

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:55.859
Yet Paul's positive attitude makes it very clear that deep-seated joy

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.460
Does not depend on our circumstances

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.939
But we do know that cultivating joy requires personal effort

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:06.180
How so

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.540
Well think about it. We know that joy that pleasant emotion that we feel when we receive

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:17.219
Something good or we anticipate receiving good things is a product of holy spirit

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:23.219
So we have to do something in order to obtain more holy spirit. We have to pray for it constantly

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:29.540
And we can do that constantly without ever doubting that Jehovah wants to give us more holy spirit

00:01:30.019 --> 00:01:36.180
Because Jesus assured us that he's a tender Heavenly Father who gives generously to his children who ask for it

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.819
But in addition to praying constantly what more can we do

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.900
Well like the Apostle Paul even when we're in the midst of trying circumstances

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:50.500
We need to think about good things our blessings

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.980
And we need to talk with our brothers and sisters about those blessings

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.219
For a few moments, let's do that

00:01:58.019 --> 00:02:04.500
Let's put aside for a moment any distracting worry or challenge or obstacle that we're facing

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:10.419
And let's savor three special blessings that Jehovah has given all of us as his people

00:02:11.539 --> 00:02:15.620
Our first blessing is alluded to at Proverbs chapter 4 and verse 18

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.340
You might take your eyes there to Proverbs chapter 4 and verse 18

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:24.979
There in contrast with the path or the way of the wicked one

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:28.020
We're told that the path of the righteous

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:30.659
That's your path. That's my path

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.340
Is like the bright morning light that grows brighter and brighter until full daylight

00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:42.340
Well, this reminds us that we have all been recipients of spiritual enlightenment

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:49.300
And that's quite a contrast to Satan's system which currently is in dense spiritual darkness

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:55.860
Think about what we enjoy because of what Jehovah has given us in the way of spiritual enlightenment

00:02:56.659 --> 00:03:00.419
We know things that the world has no clue about

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:08.500
We know that Jehovah is our God the God who causes to become and can cause you and me to become whatever's needed

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.780
To fulfill his good purpose and to bring us joy

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:18.819
We know about Jesus the powerful angels the establishment of the kingdom in 1914

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:24.099
A real government none of this is any mystery to us. We know the truth

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:30.020
We know that the big issue is not what we may see in the headlines of the world's newspapers

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:39.300
The big issue has to do with universal sovereignty and who will we choose to support Jehovah's side or Satan's side

00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:48.500
Thanks to the gift of spiritual enlightenment a path that keeps getting brighter and brighter for us as we walk closely with Jehovah and his

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:57.060
Organization we know why we suffer why we die and how temporary all of these challenging circumstances are

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.900
We are confident there will be a resurrection

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:06.099
So no matter what happens in this system of things to us personally or to those whom we love

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.379
Jehovah will undo all the damage

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:11.939
Very easily

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:14.659
Because he can do so and he wants to do so

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:23.379
Of course, there's many things that we don't yet know about the future and Jehovah's details with regard to us personally

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:28.019
We don't know the exact date of the end of this wicked system of things

00:04:28.899 --> 00:04:30.899
But our purpose in life is no secret

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.819
We know what our purpose in life is. We're going to live forever

00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:39.620
So that we can praise and fear Jehovah for all eternity

00:04:40.339 --> 00:04:49.620
Now what do you think as we ponder our gift our blessing of spiritual enlightenment? Is it ordinary or is it extraordinary?

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:56.819
That's a gift that when we think about it and when we talk about it increases our joy

00:04:58.259 --> 00:05:00.259
Let's consider a second spiritual blessing

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:05.699
It's referred to at Isaiah chapter 60 and verse 22. Please read that with me

00:05:06.899 --> 00:05:09.139
Isaiah chapter 60 and verse 22

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:18.980
The little one will become a thousand and the small one a mighty nation. I myself Jehovah will speed it up in its own time

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:30.500
What's the blessing as foretold we are seeing spiritual growth our spiritual family is getting larger and larger by the day

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:35.620
in fact on average during the 2017 service year each week

00:05:36.579 --> 00:05:41.779
five thousand four hundred were baptized in symbol of their dedication to Jehovah

00:05:42.339 --> 00:05:46.339
And in harmony with the prophecy this growth will accelerate

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:49.139
Well, what does that mean for us?

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:57.939
It means that our work here at Bethel at remote translation offices at facilities doing maintenance and cleaning and caring for

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:04.259
These beautiful facilities dedicated to Jehovah's worship at the assembly halls is urgent

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:08.980
Necessary work that supports our growing spiritual family

00:06:09.699 --> 00:06:13.779
It's another one of the blessings that Jehovah has given you and me

00:06:14.339 --> 00:06:20.420
This blessing of seeing firsthand the growth of our spiritual family and being able to support it

00:06:21.699 --> 00:06:28.819
Well consider in that same chapter of Isaiah chapter 60 an additional blessing a third mentioned in verse 17

00:06:29.779 --> 00:06:36.019
Instead of the copper I will bring in gold and instead of the iron I will bring in silver

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:45.939
Instead of the wood copper and instead of the stones iron and I will appoint peace as your overseers and righteousness as your task assigners

00:06:46.819 --> 00:06:52.740
Have you seen the fulfillment of this prophecy during this special time the conclusion of the system of things

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:56.740
Indeed, we have we have seen experienced

00:06:57.459 --> 00:07:00.420
Improvements in organizational arrangements

00:07:01.459 --> 00:07:07.860
Some in our families of congregation and here at Bethel remember when a congregation had a congregation servant

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:13.459
And not a body of elders when countries had a branch servant and not a branch committee

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:21.540
When direction was given often by the president of the watch tower a Bible and track society rather than by a clearly established governing body

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:25.779
During the 1970s though there were improvements

00:07:26.579 --> 00:07:31.860
Direction in the congregations was given principally by a body of elders not by one individual

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:36.819
Think of more recent organizational improvements having to do with our theocratic schools

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:43.060
The school for kingdom evangelizers is another one of those recent organizational improvements

00:07:43.939 --> 00:07:48.100
It's incredible to think that it was seven years ago in July 2011

00:07:48.579 --> 00:07:54.660
That the then new school the bible school for Christian couples was inaugurated in Patterson Bethel

00:07:55.220 --> 00:08:02.100
But then just two years later in 2013 the governing body approved the merger of the bible school for Christian couples

00:08:02.339 --> 00:08:08.500
With the bible school for single brothers and now we have what is known as the school for kingdom evangelizers

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:10.660
And what has resulted

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:13.379
Increase strengthening of congregations

00:08:14.019 --> 00:08:20.339
diligent workers in the harvest caring for assistance with maintenance of facilities

00:08:20.899 --> 00:08:24.180
supporting the work and foreign and indigenous language fields

00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:29.620
You know thinking about this and those other blessings we've just discussed briefly

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:38.820
Reminds me of the example in the scriptures of the experience of the unnamed and poor widow of Zarifath during the time of the prophet Elijah

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:48.259
In faith though her circumstances were dire she used her last bit of flour and oil to make bread for Jehovah's prophet and what happened

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:57.700
As Elijah had promised Jehovah added to her supply of food so that there was enough to feed her her son and the prophet

00:08:58.259 --> 00:09:02.820
The large jar of flour did not run out and the small jar of oil did not run dry

00:09:03.779 --> 00:09:09.139
Brothers and sisters each of us has a figurative jar of blessings a jar of

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:13.139
Joy's that is never going to run out

00:09:14.019 --> 00:09:20.259
Regularly we need to stop and think about what's in our jar of blessings. We need to talk about them

00:09:21.059 --> 00:09:29.059
As our kingdom song 111 says our reasons for joy are abundant and they are like riches increasing in worth

00:09:30.019 --> 00:09:35.460
So like the Apostle Paul even if our circumstances at this moment are very difficult

00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:41.940
Incredibly with Jehovah's help you and I can always rejoice
