00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:13.820
School can be stressful, whether you're in a classroom, or able to be schooled at home.

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.320
Even the best students have days where they'd rather be anywhere else.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.120
And just because you're there doesn't mean you're always plugged into what's happening.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:27.620
For example, do you deal with anxiety or depression?

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:35.119
Are you among the many young people who get bored at school or find it difficult to focus in the classroom?

00:00:35.119 --> 00:00:39.619
Does your family rely on you for financial support?

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:44.619
Do you worry about bullies or violence at school?

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:49.090
Problems like these can discourage you.

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.590
You could start to skip classes and your grades may suffer.

00:00:53.590 --> 00:01:00.590
The more you fall behind, the easier it is to listen to that little voice inside that says,

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.140
just drop out.

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.140
But wait!

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.640
The Bible says that a smart person thinks about each step he or she takes.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.640
So first, think about how school can help you.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:23.140
The real benefit of a basic education is more than just the subjects you study.

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:36.049
Education is training for your brain by studying a variety of subjects.

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:41.049
You learn how to learn and practical skills such as reading and writing.

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:44.549
Things you'll need to do in the real world.

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:51.049
The Bible encourages us to safeguard practical wisdom and thinking ability.

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:58.769
School is a great place to sharpen your problem solving skills

00:01:58.769 --> 00:02:03.269
and learn more about yourself and the people around you.

00:02:03.269 --> 00:02:09.180
Of course, the challenges you face don't just disappear.

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:12.680
But staying in school trains you to deal with them.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:20.159
You learn self-discipline and how to prioritize what's important.

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:24.159
You could learn a skill and find work after you graduate.

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:32.879
If you drop out, your options for future employment may be limited.

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:45.430
A good education also protects you.

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.430
When you're well informed, it's harder for others to take advantage of you.

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.430
So if you're struggling at school, don't give up.

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:02.430
Reach out to someone, your parents, I'm a sure friend or teacher for help.

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:11.909
In areas where the law permits it, some parents may choose to homeschool their children.

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:18.909
Wherever you attend class, make it a goal to stick with it and stay focused.

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:24.909
Eat nutritious foods, exercise and get enough sleep.

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:29.909
When your body is healthy, your brain works better.

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:33.909
The Bible says that there is benefit and hard work.

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:39.379
It's worth the effort to finish school.

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:43.379
School can help you discover and nurture abilities you never knew you had.

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:46.379
Train you to think and solve problems.

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:52.379
And prepare you to handle the responsibilities that life brings your way.
