00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.449
Children, Jehovah wants you to be happy and keep you safe.

00:00:10.449 --> 00:00:14.449
But some people want to do bad things to you.

00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:17.449
So Jehovah gave you a conscience.

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:22.449
It's like an alarm system that helps you to know right from wrong.

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:24.449
It will protect you from danger.

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.449
So Mum and I will help you test your alarm system.

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.449
Ready?

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:33.450
What if someone tells you something that makes you feel uncomfortable or scares you?

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.450
What do you do?

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.450
I'm not sure, but that's weird. Stop.

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.450
Very good. Tell them to stop it.

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.450
And you tell Mum and Daddy.

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:48.450
No matter what someone tells you, never keep a secret from us.

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.450
What if they ask you to do something that makes you feel uncomfortable?

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:56.450
I would say no.

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.450
You're right. You should say no and walk away.

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.450
What if they try to touch you where they shouldn't?

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:07.450
I wouldn't let them. I'd get out of there.

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.450
Good, Caleb. Even if it's an adult you know and trust,

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.450
you should say no and run away.

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.450
And you should yell, stop doing that. I'm going to tell on you.

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.450
Stop doing that. I'm going to tell on you.

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.450
The world can be a scary place, but you are never alone.

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:31.450
Remember, you have your conscience, your Mum and Daddy will love you.

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.450
And you have Jehovah.
