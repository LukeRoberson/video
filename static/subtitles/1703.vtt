00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.639
I was born in the northern of Germany.

00:00:05.639 --> 00:00:08.640
I didn't have a very good relationship to my father

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:14.640
because he drank a lot, and very often he was mean to me.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.640
On the other hand, my mother, really, she was kind, lovely.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.640
And I can tell you, I loved my mother from the bottom of my heart.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.640
One day, the doctors diagnosed it that she has cancer

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.640
and only a few days later, she died and she was gone.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.640
And this was for me, horrible, I tell you.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:43.530
I feel completely empty, no hope, angry.

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.530
I couldn't understand, really, I couldn't get it.

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.530
How a God can be so painful to others

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.509
and take the best of what I had in my life, just take it away.

00:00:55.509 --> 00:00:59.509
I hate everything around me.

00:00:59.509 --> 00:01:01.509
I will never trust anyone.

00:01:01.509 --> 00:01:06.510
And especially, I lost also the trust completely in God.

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.510
And therefore, I decide to go to the German Air Force.

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.819
It starts with a basic training.

00:01:14.819 --> 00:01:17.819
So the idea is we have to follow orders,

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:19.819
doesn't matter what happens.

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:23.819
So a special training was also hand-to-hand combat.

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:25.819
And this gives you a lot of confidence.

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:28.819
You're saying nobody can hurt you once again.

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:30.819
You feel very strong.

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:34.819
I remember some situation we were outside in the woods.

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:37.819
And this was part of the survival training.

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:42.819
I felt instructable and very proud of myself.

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:45.819
So a little later, on my military career,

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:49.819
I was working with a missile launch crew.

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:55.819
One day, I realized that just with one launch of this missile

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:59.819
I could be responsible for to kill thousands of people.

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:04.819
When all this comes to my mind, I start to think,

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:07.819
is it possible there is a God existing?

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:12.819
And when so, how would he think about my work what I'm doing here?

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:15.819
There was in my family, my aunt.

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:17.819
And once she told me,

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.819
Dear, if someday you will like to know something

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:23.819
more about God about the Bible,

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:25.819
you have to contact your old witnesses.

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:28.819
They know exactly what is the prophecy from the Bible

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:30.819
and this can give you hope.

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:32.819
And from there on, I studied the Bible

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.819
and also I came to the meetings from them.

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:39.819
So in one meeting, my wife Elvia sitting beside me,

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:42.819
I was sure I have to make a big change.

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:46.819
To be together with these people who love Jehovah God

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:53.300
and I am still working for the German Air Force.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.300
I decided, officially,

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:00.300
to refuse the military service because my conjured buzz on me.

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.300
I felt very confident that this was the right decision to do.

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.300
So at that court day,

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.300
and this was surprising for me,

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:14.300
they told me that my request will be rejected.

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.300
If I refuse to go on with my military service,

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.300
I will be sent to prison.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.300
I really didn't know what to do.

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.300
And then I saw that Jehovah took over.

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:29.300
My side commander told me,

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:30.300
do you know what?

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:31.300
I have a solution for you.

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.300
You can appeal the court decision.

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.300
He offered me an office job.

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.300
So the only thing I have to do was a paperwork

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.300
and a shift from eight hours.

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.300
I was finished after two hours.

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:47.300
I was done with this.

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:50.300
Six months, five days a week,

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:52.300
six hours a day.

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.300
I was just starting and studying.

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:58.300
I felt not only that I drove closer to Jehovah.

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.300
I also was convinced now that in the past time,

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:05.300
I was just relying on myself.

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:06.300
I trust only me.

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:11.300
But now I got the opportunity to lay everything

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:14.300
what I needed to Jehovah.

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:18.300
Every and I, we got really deeply discussions.

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:20.300
I'm in prison and she alone.

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:25.300
I was wondering how she could take care on herself.

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.300
If I have to go to prison,

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:33.250
we still, we stick to Jehovah and to his ways.

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.250
So if the court arrived,

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.250
I asked Jehovah,

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.250
please Jehovah, give me the strength

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.250
and also the wisdom and the right words

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.250
to bring glory fire on his name.

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.250
After the hearing,

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:49.250
the providing judge told me

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:51.250
when the decision is made,

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.250
it will be final.

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:55.250
So back in my unit,

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:57.250
the next days, they were horrible.

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:01.250
One day, my side commander came in into my office

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:04.250
and he got a very, very serious face.

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:05.250
Wow.

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:06.250
I knew what was coming up.

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:09.250
I was seeing me already behind the bars.

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.250
Then surprising,

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:12.250
he told me,

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:15.250
hey, this is a set use for me.

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:18.250
The decision is made.

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:19.250
You are free to go.

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:23.250
And I will lose my best officer what I have.

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:25.250
In this moment,

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:29.250
well, I remember the tears comes out.

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:31.250
I couldn't hide it back.

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:34.250
And I was so thankful to Jehovah.

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:35.250
And I felt really,

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:38.250
this was the best decision I made

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:41.250
to stick to Jehovah and not to man.

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:43.250
So every and I,

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:47.250
we dedicated our life completely to Jehovah.

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:49.250
And now, because of the privilege to serve him,

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:52.250
almost 50 years together.

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:55.250
The scripture at Isaiah 40,

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:57.250
verses 10 and 11,

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:58.250
comes really to my mind.

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:00.250
Jehovah will come with power,

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:03.250
like a shepherd he will care for his flock,

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:06.250
and certainly, he did.

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:09.250
It doesn't matter what Satan ever brings to you.

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:13.250
This relationship with Jehovah leads always to success.
