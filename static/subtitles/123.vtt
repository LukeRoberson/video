00:00:01.389 --> 00:00:05.889
Welcome to J.W. Broadcasting.

00:00:05.889 --> 00:00:10.390
This month will explore the appealing quality of humility,

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:15.890
the many ways it enriches our life and brings joy to Jehovah.

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:20.890
We'll see how husbands and wives can work together with humility

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:26.890
to resolve disagreements and restore peace in their marriage.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.390
Do you find it difficult to navigate this increasingly polarized world?

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.890
We'll hear from young publishers who have learned to imitate humbly

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.890
Jehovah's Reasonableness.

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.390
Are you sometimes discouraged by your flaws?

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:48.890
This month's music video invites us to be like soft clay

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.890
that Jehovah molds into a beautiful spiritual person.

00:00:53.890 --> 00:01:18.209
This is J.W. Broadcasting for February 2025.

00:01:18.209 --> 00:01:23.709
Have you ever considered who is the greatest example of humility?

00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:26.709
If your answer is Jehovah, you're correct.

00:01:26.709 --> 00:01:33.209
Why? Because every living intelligent creation is inferior to him,

00:01:33.209 --> 00:01:39.709
yet he chose to and continues to include others in his activities.

00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:49.209
Humility can be described as lowliness of mind and being free from pride and arrogance.

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:56.709
A humble person finds happiness in including others in his life and endeavors.

00:01:56.709 --> 00:02:01.709
Because of its many benefits, our theme for discussion this month is

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:08.210
humility, a quality that will enrich our life eternally.

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:13.210
Jehovah's great measure of humility became apparent when he collaborated

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:20.210
with his only begotten son and included him as his master worker in creation.

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:26.210
Later, as angels were created, these mighty spirit creatures

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:30.710
imitated the humility already being shown by Jehovah.

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:37.210
These faithful angels were free from pride and arrogance.

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:43.210
This resulted in everyone in heaven enjoying peace for eons of time.

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:47.210
Humility in heaven was like oil to an engine.

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:51.210
It keeps things running smoothly.

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:56.210
Satan was the first one to succumb to the temptation of pride and arrogance,

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:00.210
rejecting the godlike quality of humility.

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:06.210
When he did so, rebellion and turmoil soon followed.

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:11.210
But it's important for us to note that the need for humility

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:17.210
didn't arise because of sin, rebellion, and imperfection.

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:21.210
Humility existed before these ugly traits.

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:28.210
It's also vital for us to understand that while Jehovah is inferior to no one,

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:32.210
that's not the case with us.

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:38.210
Jehovah knows that the quality of humility will help us in our imperfect condition.

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:44.210
For example, it will help us to imitate him, to faithfully serve him,

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:47.210
and to survive the end of the system of things.

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:55.210
Yes, Jehovah knows that humility will enrich our lives today and eternally.

00:03:55.210 --> 00:04:00.210
We can see how important this endearing quality is to Jehovah

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:04.210
to read Psalm 45 verses 3 and 4.

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:08.210
Jehovah gave these prophetic instructions to his kingly son

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:12.210
before the great battle in heaven.

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:19.209
Strap your sword on your side, O mighty one, in your dignity and your splendor,

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:27.209
and in your splendor, go on to victory, ride in the cause of truth and humility and righteousness.

00:04:27.209 --> 00:04:32.209
These verses describe Jesus Christ as a king,

00:04:32.209 --> 00:04:38.209
writing in battle to defend truth, humility, and righteousness.

00:04:38.209 --> 00:04:44.209
The greatest truth he defends is the sanctification of Jehovah's great name.

00:04:44.209 --> 00:04:50.209
In connection with righteousness, he supports Jehovah's standards of right and wrong,

00:04:50.209 --> 00:04:55.209
and in the case of humility, he restores it to its rightful place

00:04:55.209 --> 00:04:58.209
among all intelligent creation.

00:04:58.209 --> 00:05:04.579
Jesus has already reaffirmed these timeless standards in heaven,

00:05:04.579 --> 00:05:09.579
soon he'll do the same for the earth, with the commission to save only those

00:05:09.579 --> 00:05:12.579
who are humble and obedient.

00:05:12.579 --> 00:05:19.579
Our developing and displaying humility then is essential to our survival.

00:05:19.579 --> 00:05:24.579
If you want to know if you're truly humble at heart, ask yourself,

00:05:24.579 --> 00:05:27.579
how do others view me?

00:05:27.579 --> 00:05:30.579
If you serve as a congregation elder,

00:05:30.579 --> 00:05:35.579
do your fellow elders feel comfortable giving you counsel?

00:05:35.579 --> 00:05:38.579
When was the last time they did so?

00:05:38.579 --> 00:05:40.579
How did you react?

00:05:40.579 --> 00:05:48.579
If you're serving as a pioneer, do you endeavor to learn from those with less experience?

00:05:48.579 --> 00:05:56.579
Do our loved ones and our family feel that we really consider their opinion on matters?

00:05:56.579 --> 00:06:00.579
Why are questions like these important?

00:06:00.579 --> 00:06:07.579
Because a truly humble person will make a realistic assessment of himself with such questions.

00:06:07.579 --> 00:06:14.579
Why is that? Because humility is directly related to honesty.

00:06:14.579 --> 00:06:19.579
True humility enables us to see ourselves as we really are

00:06:19.579 --> 00:06:25.579
and to honestly admit all of our weaknesses and failures.

00:06:25.579 --> 00:06:32.579
In contrast, pride and arrogance are directly related to deception

00:06:32.579 --> 00:06:37.579
and arrogant person covers up his weaknesses and failures.

00:06:37.579 --> 00:06:43.579
And that can only last so long because eventually pride leads to a crash

00:06:43.579 --> 00:06:48.899
as Proverbs 16 verse 18 warns us.

00:06:48.899 --> 00:06:55.430
Let's consider five ways that humility enriches our life.

00:06:55.430 --> 00:07:01.430
First, the Bible clearly teaches that humble people receive God's help.

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:04.430
One example is David.

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:07.430
He became a powerful king in Israel,

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:14.430
yet notice who he attributed his greatness to at Psalm 18 verse 35.

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:19.430
You give me your shield of salvation, your right hand supports me,

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:23.430
and your humility makes me great.

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:28.430
Because Jehovah is humble, he lured himself to assist David,

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:33.430
enabling this humble man to become a mighty king.

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:39.430
Down to our day, Jehovah delights to come to the aid of his humble servants.

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:45.680
Have you not felt him stoop down as it were to help you?

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:51.680
The second benefit is that having a humble disposition will protect us

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:56.680
just as a heavy coat can protect us from harsh elements.

00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:02.680
It also makes our personality more attractive to Jehovah and to others.

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:08.680
Notice the word picture Peter used at first Peter 5 verse 5b.

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:13.680
But all of you clothe yourselves with humility toward one another

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:17.680
because God opposes the haughty ones,

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:21.680
but he gives undeserved kindness to the humble ones.

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:25.680
Clothing both protects and dignifies.

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:30.680
If remissing an item of clothing or our clothing is frayed,

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:32.679
others can surely see it.

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:40.679
Likewise, others can usually see if we're not fully clothed with humility.

00:08:40.679 --> 00:08:44.679
In contrast, the more humility we display,

00:08:44.679 --> 00:08:48.679
the more attractive we are to Jehovah and to others.

00:08:48.679 --> 00:08:54.679
Just like a favorite garment, humility should be our go-to quality

00:08:54.679 --> 00:08:58.679
that's perfect for any occasion.

00:08:58.679 --> 00:09:04.679
A third benefit of humility is that it fosters teamwork.

00:09:04.679 --> 00:09:09.679
When co-workers apply Philippians chapter 2 verse 3,

00:09:09.679 --> 00:09:13.679
they're able to enjoy productive collaboration.

00:09:13.679 --> 00:09:16.679
That verse says,

00:09:16.679 --> 00:09:20.679
do nothing out of contentiousness or out of ecotism,

00:09:20.679 --> 00:09:25.679
but with humility consider others superior to you.

00:09:26.679 --> 00:09:30.679
When we appreciate that everyone is superior to us in some way,

00:09:30.679 --> 00:09:34.679
we'll be more inclined to listen to their suggestions.

00:09:34.679 --> 00:09:39.679
Humility promotes cooperation, not competition.

00:09:39.679 --> 00:09:46.679
Humble people see others as resources and contributors, not rivals.

00:09:46.679 --> 00:09:49.679
Consider a single musician.

00:09:49.679 --> 00:09:54.679
By himself, he can generally only produce the sound from one instrument.

00:09:54.679 --> 00:09:57.679
However, as a member of an orchestra,

00:09:57.679 --> 00:10:01.679
the entire music performance is enriched.

00:10:01.679 --> 00:10:06.679
A humble musician finds contentment and collaboration,

00:10:06.679 --> 00:10:10.679
even if that places him in the background.

00:10:10.679 --> 00:10:15.679
He doesn't aspire to receive all the attention of a solo performance

00:10:15.679 --> 00:10:20.679
or to place all out, he drowns out his fellow performers.

00:10:21.679 --> 00:10:26.679
One translation renders humility at Philippians 2 verse 3

00:10:26.679 --> 00:10:29.679
to be self-effacing.

00:10:29.679 --> 00:10:33.679
This means to make ourselves inconspicuous,

00:10:33.679 --> 00:10:38.679
working in the background and avoiding the limelight.

00:10:38.679 --> 00:10:44.679
That's like a photographer who takes portraits of others instead of himself.

00:10:44.679 --> 00:10:47.679
And as he focuses on others,

00:10:47.679 --> 00:10:52.679
the photographer endeavors to capture their features in the best light

00:10:52.679 --> 00:10:55.679
so that they look their best.

00:10:55.679 --> 00:10:58.679
The same principle applies to our sacred service.

00:10:58.679 --> 00:11:01.679
In all aspects of our worship,

00:11:01.679 --> 00:11:05.679
let's remember that we're part of Jehovah's team.

00:11:05.679 --> 00:11:08.679
By all of us humbly cooperating together,

00:11:08.679 --> 00:11:13.679
we'll be useful to Jehovah in accomplishing his will.

00:11:13.679 --> 00:11:21.679
Our humility will put others in a favorable light with God and with others.

00:11:21.679 --> 00:11:27.679
A fourth benefit of humility is that a humble person generally enjoys

00:11:27.679 --> 00:11:32.679
seeing others make advancement or receive privileges.

00:11:32.679 --> 00:11:35.679
John the Baptist is a good example in this regard.

00:11:35.679 --> 00:11:40.679
He humbly acknowledged that Jesus' ministry would keep on increasing

00:11:40.679 --> 00:11:45.679
as his own work would keep on decreasing.

00:11:45.679 --> 00:11:48.679
How did John feel about that?

00:11:48.679 --> 00:11:54.679
Seeing the advancement of Jesus moved John to say at John 3 verse 29,

00:11:54.679 --> 00:11:59.679
my joy has been made complete.

00:11:59.679 --> 00:12:05.679
Like John, humility allows a brother to be an overseer at one time

00:12:05.679 --> 00:12:09.679
and one being overseen at another time.

00:12:09.679 --> 00:12:13.679
If you have the privilege to serve as a congregation elder,

00:12:13.679 --> 00:12:18.679
can you see how this spirit would benefit your entire elder body?

00:12:18.679 --> 00:12:24.679
A fifth benefit is that humility helps us to endure opposition.

00:12:24.679 --> 00:12:28.679
A humble person doesn't feel he's above being reproached.

00:12:28.679 --> 00:12:33.679
He's able to endure unpleasant situations and not retaliate

00:12:33.679 --> 00:12:37.679
if Jehovah permits him to suffer adversity.

00:12:37.679 --> 00:12:43.679
We have the example of Jesus as highlighted at 1 Peter 2 verse 23.

00:12:43.679 --> 00:12:47.679
There it says, when he was being insulted,

00:12:47.679 --> 00:12:50.679
he did not insult in return.

00:12:50.679 --> 00:12:53.679
When he was suffering, he did not threaten,

00:12:53.679 --> 00:13:00.679
but he entrusted himself to the one who judges righteously.

00:13:00.679 --> 00:13:02.679
What helped Jesus to endure?

00:13:02.679 --> 00:13:04.679
Humility.

00:13:04.679 --> 00:13:08.679
He didn't think, do you know who I am?

00:13:08.679 --> 00:13:12.679
I shouldn't have to suffer like this.

00:13:12.679 --> 00:13:19.679
Likewise, our maintaining a humble demeanor may well serve as a protection for us,

00:13:19.679 --> 00:13:25.679
perhaps even moving observers to come to our aid when others oppose us.

00:13:25.679 --> 00:13:32.679
We've just talked about five benefits of humility and there are many others.

00:13:32.679 --> 00:13:41.679
But what if we find that our background or culture makes cultivating humility especially challenging for us?

00:13:41.679 --> 00:13:43.679
This is how you feel.

00:13:43.679 --> 00:13:51.679
You may be encouraged by the example of a Roman army officer introduced to us in Matthew 8.

00:13:51.679 --> 00:13:57.679
A Roman centurion had direct command of about 100 soldiers.

00:13:57.679 --> 00:14:02.679
He likely had a past littered with many acts of violence and bloodshed.

00:14:02.679 --> 00:14:08.679
Humility was likely not a quality associated with many officers of this rank.

00:14:08.679 --> 00:14:15.440
Let's read the account in Matthew 8.5 through 8.

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:21.440
When he Jesus entered Capernaum, an army officer came to him pleading with him and saying,

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:28.440
Sir, my servant is laid up in the house with paralysis and he's suffering terribly.

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:33.440
He said to him, When I get there, I will cure him.

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:39.440
The army officer replied, Sir, I'm not worthy to have you come under my roof,

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:44.440
but just say the word and my servant will be healed.

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:54.440
The officers addressing Jesus twice as Sir was significant since Romans generally despised Jews.

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:59.440
This army officer also said in verse 8, I am not worthy.

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:05.440
In other words, I'm not important enough for you to come under my roof.

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:13.440
Though I named in the scriptures, he proved himself to be an outstanding example of humility.

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:19.440
Note what Jesus said about this officer at Matthew 8 verse 10.

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:24.440
When Jesus heard that, he was amazed and said to those following him,

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:31.440
I tell you the truth, with no one in Israel have I found so great a faith.

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:34.440
How does this account encourage us?

00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:41.440
Despite our past, like the army officer, all of us can develop humility.

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:44.440
How can we do so?

00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:49.440
Cultivate a desire to be humble to your very core.

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:55.440
Frequently remind yourself that to please God, you must be humble.

00:15:55.440 --> 00:16:02.440
Also remember that pride and arrogance are traits of Satan.

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:09.440
Keep the correct perspective by meditating on your insignificance compared to Jehovah.

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:15.440
And pray to Jehovah for help to display humility as he does.

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:23.440
Happiness in marriage requires humility, especially when husbands and wives don't see eye to eye.

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:29.440
When a disagreement leads to hurt feelings, do we find it hard to apologize?

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:45.870
Notice what can help in this episode of For a Happy Marriage.

00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:52.870
A strong marriage can be an oasis of peace in a difficult world.

00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:59.870
But no matter how strong the bond, every marriage consists of an imperfect man

00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:23.849
and an imperfect woman living in a confined space.

00:17:23.849 --> 00:17:35.980
Even in a happy marriage, disagreements can arise that lead loving spouses to use hurtful words.

00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:42.980
At a certain point, you may not even remember how the disagreement started, and yet the conflict escalates.

00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:57.339
As this ever happened to you, did you apologize and make things right?

00:17:57.339 --> 00:18:04.579
The mere passing of time won't make the hurt disappear.

00:18:04.579 --> 00:18:13.299
The real triumph, peace, can only come about with a sincere apology.

00:18:13.299 --> 00:18:17.299
Do nothing out of contentiousness or out of ego-tism.

00:18:17.299 --> 00:18:23.990
But with humility, consider others superior to you.

00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:26.990
Try to see things from your spouse's viewpoint.

00:18:26.990 --> 00:19:24.880
How would a sincere apology make you feel?

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:27.880
Don't let your ego get in the way.

00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:36.849
Take responsibility for your part in the dispute.

00:19:36.849 --> 00:19:40.849
Even if you don't think you've done anything wrong.

00:19:40.849 --> 00:19:44.849
Acknowledge the hurt you've caused your spouse.

00:19:44.849 --> 00:19:49.849
And be quick to accept each other's sincere apologies.

00:19:49.849 --> 00:19:54.849
Peaceful relationships are worth much more than pride or victory.

00:19:54.849 --> 00:20:32.650
But peace in the family must be maintained.

00:20:32.650 --> 00:20:37.650
It can be easy to focus on your mate's flaws.

00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:41.650
And when you feel like you're being pushed to your limit?

00:20:41.650 --> 00:20:47.650
Remember, James 3, verse 2 says,

00:20:47.650 --> 00:20:50.650
We all stumble many times.

00:20:50.650 --> 00:21:01.750
The quicker you apologize, no matter who is to blame,

00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:09.220
the faster you restore the peace and happiness in your family.

00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:14.220
When you sincerely apologize and accept your mate's apology,

00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:17.220
you put your marriage ahead of yourself

00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:24.769
and continue to strengthen your bond of love.

00:21:24.769 --> 00:21:27.769
Every couple will have disagreements.

00:21:27.769 --> 00:21:32.769
So take the time now to prepare it together for a peaceful resolution.

00:21:32.769 --> 00:21:40.680
Earlier, we noted that humility is linked to honesty.

00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:45.680
Being honest with ourselves about our own weaknesses and faults

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:48.680
cultivates empathy for our spouse

00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:53.680
and makes it easier to offer and accept their sincere apology.

00:21:53.680 --> 00:22:01.680
Promoting peace outside the home can be even more challenging in this deeply divided world.

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:04.680
People are ideologically polarized.

00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:10.680
Some argue that we should accept every lifestyle and belief without exception.

00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:14.680
Others view those who are different with hatred.

00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:20.680
The Bible reveals from Jehovah's perspective how we should treat others.

00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:28.680
In our next segment, see how learning about the strength and the faith of two young ones.

00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:40.720
In what ways have you seen people treat others who are different from them?

00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:44.720
When I was at school, a common viewpoint of my schoolmates

00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:48.720
was that you should be accepting of whatever lifestyle someone chooses to lead.

00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:53.720
Teachers would encourage us to support those with different sexual orientations.

00:22:53.720 --> 00:23:00.660
In my final year of high school, a new teacher arrived.

00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:05.660
He was different. He came from the capital and I lived in a small town.

00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:13.819
He had spent many years at university and didn't believe in God.

00:23:13.819 --> 00:23:19.819
On social media, it was very common to see extreme viewpoints about different lifestyles.

00:23:19.819 --> 00:23:25.710
I often saw comments attacking others for their lifestyles.

00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:31.750
The teacher had a very different personality.

00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:36.750
He seemed to like attacking the students and putting them on the spot.

00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:40.750
He would ask probing questions about controversial topics in class

00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:45.750
and even made comments to the class like the people from here aren't made for learning.

00:23:45.750 --> 00:23:48.750
Of course, the students didn't react very well.

00:23:48.750 --> 00:23:50.750
Many of them refused to attend his classes.

00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:54.750
Or if they did, they refused to speak to him during the class.

00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:58.750
I remember them saying, I'm not going to talk with that atheist.

00:23:58.750 --> 00:24:01.750
I remember that some classmates would say to me,

00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:05.750
don't Jehovah's Witnesses hate gay people?

00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:09.750
It seemed like many students assumed that we must have an extreme viewpoint

00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:14.750
and that we would completely reject those who don't conform to our beliefs.

00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:20.990
What helped you get the Bible's viewpoint?

00:24:20.990 --> 00:24:25.990
My parents always helped me to have a balanced viewpoint.

00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:31.990
As I was growing up, they helped me understand that even though we completely reject certain conduct,

00:24:31.990 --> 00:24:34.990
we don't hate the person who practices it.

00:24:34.990 --> 00:24:37.990
I learned a lot from my mom's example.

00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:42.990
She used to work at a beauty salon and I saw how she was always kind to others she worked with,

00:24:42.990 --> 00:24:45.990
regardless of their sexual orientation.

00:24:45.990 --> 00:24:49.990
I thought of Jesus' example, how he shared the message with everyone,

00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:52.990
no matter their thinking or background.

00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:55.990
Jesus took the time to talk with them,

00:24:55.990 --> 00:24:58.990
no matter who they were or what others thought of them.

00:24:58.990 --> 00:25:01.990
I love the scripture at Matthew 5.45,

00:25:01.990 --> 00:25:06.990
where it says that Jehovah makes the sunshine and the rainfall on all people.

00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:09.990
This is an expression of his love,

00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:13.990
to provide what each person needs, no matter who they are.

00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:15.990
As I was thinking about Jesus' example,

00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:18.990
I remembered his words recorded at Matthew,

00:25:18.990 --> 00:25:21.990
where he tells us that what you want men to do to you,

00:25:21.990 --> 00:25:23.990
you also must do to them.

00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:27.990
This helped me to think about how I should act around my teacher.

00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:29.990
It made me treat him differently.

00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:34.990
I mean, if Jehovah, the Almighty God,

00:25:34.990 --> 00:25:39.990
is kind, good, and respectful toward all,

00:25:39.990 --> 00:25:41.990
why shouldn't I be?

00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:44.990
And that would include those whose conduct I don't agree with.

00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:48.990
Jehovah has given us the best way to show our love for our neighbor,

00:25:48.990 --> 00:25:55.640
by helping them to come to know him.

00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:59.640
What has been the outcome of applying Bible principles?

00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:04.640
At my previous job, I worked at a hotel where there was a waiter who was gay.

00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:07.640
Some of his coworkers would treat him poorly.

00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:10.640
So I made sure I didn't join in with them,

00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:13.640
and treated him like I would anyone else.

00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:16.640
I was able to have conversations with my teacher about the Bible,

00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:18.640
and share scriptures with him.

00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:21.640
He was impressed by what the Bible had to say on scientific matters,

00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:23.640
and said he wanted to find out more.

00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:26.640
One day, the waiter came up to me,

00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:30.640
and thanked me for being different from the others in the way I treated him.

00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:34.640
Even some of the other waiters asked me why I was like that.

00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:39.640
This opened up the opportunity to explain that I tried to apply Bible principles in my life,

00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:42.640
including how I treat others.

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:46.640
There was a noticeable change in the teacher as the school year went on.

00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:49.640
He told me that he was impressed by my conduct,

00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:53.640
and because I had spoken with him when none of the other students would.

00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:58.640
His classes became so much better because he started to be nicer to his students.

00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:01.640
Little by little, the students returned to class,

00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:07.640
and by the end of the year, it had become one of the classes that we enjoyed the most.

00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:10.640
When I think about the way that Jehovah treats people,

00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:13.640
and how he gives everyone a chance to learn about him,

00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:15.640
I'm drawn to him even more.

00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:32.460
Living by Bible standards does mean that we agree with every belief or opinion that others have.

00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:37.460
It does mean treating everyone with dignity and respect,

00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:41.460
regardless of the choices they make.

00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:46.460
Jehovah wants all people to have an opportunity to know him.

00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:51.460
Public witnessing has long been a powerful way to accomplish this.

00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:56.460
Yet many aspects of this work have changed over time.

00:27:56.460 --> 00:28:02.460
As we'll see in this episode of Our History in Motion.

00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:09.900
As Jehovah's Witnesses, we preach to people wherever we find them.

00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:15.900
Today, our literature carts in displays are a common sight all over the world.

00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:19.900
But how did public witnessing get started?

00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:29.809
We'll explore this story of courage and innovation on this episode of Our History in Motion.

00:28:29.809 --> 00:28:32.809
Jesus set the precedent for public witnessing.

00:28:32.809 --> 00:28:36.809
He taught in the main streets and along the road.

00:28:36.809 --> 00:28:41.809
The Apostle Paul and other first century Christians followed that courageous pattern.

00:28:41.809 --> 00:28:47.920
Jehovah's Monoday people follow a similar example.

00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:51.920
In the late 1800s, the Bible students, as we were called back then,

00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:56.920
published a booklet called The Bible Versus Evolution.

00:28:56.920 --> 00:29:00.920
The goal? To distribute over 300,000 copies.

00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:04.920
But there was only a small group of Bible students at the time.

00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:10.099
How could they distribute that much literature?

00:29:10.099 --> 00:29:15.099
The April 15th, 1899 issue of the Watchtower sent out a call.

00:29:15.099 --> 00:29:18.099
Volunteers wanted.

00:29:18.099 --> 00:29:25.099
To stand at street corners outside of churches distributing the track to anyone interested.

00:29:25.099 --> 00:29:28.099
Clergy members were not happy with this.

00:29:28.099 --> 00:29:32.099
They even tried to have the publishers arrested for distributing free tracks.

00:29:32.099 --> 00:29:37.099
Nonetheless, the Bible students courageously did not give up.

00:29:37.099 --> 00:29:45.099
And just one year, over 900,000 tracks were distributed at street corners all across North America and Europe.

00:29:46.099 --> 00:29:49.099
Our public witnessing work was just getting started.

00:29:49.099 --> 00:29:57.500
In the 1920s, we launched a massive preaching campaign around the publication and public talk series.

00:29:57.500 --> 00:30:00.500
Millions now living will never die.

00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:05.500
We thought outside the box and tried numerous methods to draw the public's attention.

00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:06.500
And it worked.

00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:13.940
Over the next several years, we developed even more methods of reaching people.

00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:23.460
Brothers and sisters even wore their public witnessing in the form of placards known as sandwich boards.

00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:28.410
And magazine bags.

00:30:28.410 --> 00:30:31.410
There were information marches.

00:30:31.410 --> 00:30:34.410
Imagine being part of one.

00:30:34.410 --> 00:30:37.410
And brother Rutherford, of course, was a shorthand expert.

00:30:37.410 --> 00:30:42.410
And whenever you talk to him, he'd always be busy writing.

00:30:42.410 --> 00:30:44.410
He would be making notes about it in a way.

00:30:44.410 --> 00:30:46.410
So he's doing that this day.

00:30:46.410 --> 00:30:48.410
He ripped it off and he gave it to me.

00:30:48.410 --> 00:30:50.410
He said, what do you think of it?

00:30:50.410 --> 00:30:53.410
And it said, religions are snare in their racket.

00:30:53.410 --> 00:30:57.410
So I said, that's pretty strong.

00:30:57.410 --> 00:31:00.410
As a matter of fact, I said, that's hot.

00:31:00.410 --> 00:31:03.410
Well, he said, that's what I meant it to be.

00:31:03.410 --> 00:31:05.410
So now he said, don't you think it's a good idea?

00:31:05.410 --> 00:31:09.410
Now, we're going to have a big information march two days from now.

00:31:09.410 --> 00:31:12.410
Couldn't brother play in the printing, make up some signs.

00:31:12.410 --> 00:31:17.410
There in Iraq and put them on poles and we'll have them for the parade.

00:31:17.410 --> 00:31:18.410
So, all right.

00:31:18.410 --> 00:31:20.410
And that's what we did.

00:31:20.410 --> 00:31:22.410
And brother Rutherford also in London at that time.

00:31:22.410 --> 00:31:24.410
So he and I led this parade.

00:31:24.410 --> 00:31:26.410
This parade was six miles long.

00:31:26.410 --> 00:31:28.410
A thousand brothers showed up for the parade.

00:31:28.410 --> 00:31:30.410
It really was a spectacle.

00:31:30.410 --> 00:31:36.410
In the years that followed, information marches such as these took place across the world.

00:31:36.410 --> 00:31:47.009
In January of 1940, the informant announced the beginning of magazine streetwork.

00:31:47.009 --> 00:31:52.009
With the focus on working the busiest parts of cities.

00:31:52.009 --> 00:32:00.009
After that, many became familiar with Jehovah's Witnesses by seeing us offering magazines on streets all over the world.

00:32:00.009 --> 00:32:04.009
However, not everyone appreciated our efforts.

00:32:04.009 --> 00:32:09.009
In some cases, entire mobs of people would attack our brothers and sisters.

00:32:09.009 --> 00:32:15.009
But they courageously pressed forward in the preaching work despite the constant threat of violence.

00:32:15.009 --> 00:32:24.349
Their faithful presence and personal interest even led some to change their opinion of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:32:24.349 --> 00:32:33.349
You might even know a brother or sister who found the truth by stopping at a literature display at a university, shopping center, or airport.

00:32:33.349 --> 00:32:44.349
A major milestone occurred at the dawn of the 21st century when the governing body approved our brothers in France to begin testing different methods of public witnessing.

00:32:44.349 --> 00:32:50.349
Including the use of literature cards, which looked much different from what we used today.

00:32:50.349 --> 00:33:00.349
After years of success, the governing body continued to make refinements to public witnessing, including the development of special metropolitan public witnessing.

00:33:00.349 --> 00:33:06.349
These changes put us in contact with people we wouldn't have found when working from house to house.

00:33:06.349 --> 00:33:10.789
That brings us to today.

00:33:10.789 --> 00:33:14.789
Public witnessing is a key part of our ministry.

00:33:14.789 --> 00:33:18.789
Literature cards are so familiar that we've even written a song about them.

00:33:18.789 --> 00:33:28.259
But whether you're one of thousands in an information march or just one publisher on a street corner, the goal is the same.

00:33:28.259 --> 00:33:33.259
To demonstrate our love for Jehovah and to reach people's hearts.

00:33:33.259 --> 00:33:37.259
See you next time on, our history and motion.

00:33:37.259 --> 00:33:45.930
Can you picture yourself among the thousand witnesses in that six mile long information march?

00:33:45.930 --> 00:33:52.930
It takes courage and humility to step out into the public eye and proclaim the good news.

00:33:52.930 --> 00:33:57.930
Through public witnessing, we've scattered countless seeds of truth.

00:33:57.930 --> 00:34:06.180
It can take some time to see the positive impact of our decisions to serve others and Jehovah.

00:34:07.180 --> 00:34:14.780
That was the case with Michael and Linda Degregorio. Here's their experience.

00:34:14.780 --> 00:34:18.780
We love spending time with people who want to do more in Jehovah's service.

00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:22.780
Being willing to serve others leads to a life full of blessings.

00:34:22.780 --> 00:34:29.780
In the late 1970s, Linda and I were both assigned as special pioneers in Minnesota. That's who we first met.

00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:36.780
Then I was invited to Gillian, it was assigned to the Dominican Republic serving at the branch, and that's what we got married and Linda joined me there.

00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:44.780
The Dominican Republic branch was still quite small in those years, so right after we got married, our assigned room was the Bethel Library.

00:34:44.780 --> 00:34:50.780
And we were told this is the library, so the door needs to be open until nine o'clock at night, every night.

00:34:50.780 --> 00:34:54.780
So that presented some unique challenges?

00:34:54.780 --> 00:34:58.780
And that really was a life lesson for us. You really need to keep a good sense of humor.

00:34:58.780 --> 00:35:04.780
By nature, I'm pretty shy, but Dominicans are fun and open and very lighthearted.

00:35:04.780 --> 00:35:11.780
That was a huge help to me because I learned a lot about how not to take things so seriously.

00:35:11.780 --> 00:35:16.780
And I also learned things that we considered essentials were not essentials.

00:35:16.780 --> 00:35:21.780
You could live very happily with a lot less, and that was really good training for me.

00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:26.780
So after being in the Dominican Republic for a few years, the work was moving forward.

00:35:26.780 --> 00:35:32.780
There was a new branch under construction, and it even looked like we were going to have the possibility of having a room with an ocean view.

00:35:32.780 --> 00:35:34.780
But all of that was about to change.

00:35:34.780 --> 00:35:36.780
It certainly was.

00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:43.019
In 1989, the Berlin Wall fell, and that started a ripple effect.

00:35:43.019 --> 00:35:50.019
A lot of the small countries in Eastern Europe were starting to gain independence, and now they were able to have more religious freedom than they ever had before.

00:35:50.019 --> 00:35:58.019
It was very interesting to us because Mike had family in Albania, which was one of those countries that had been under band for many years.

00:35:58.019 --> 00:36:06.019
We thought maybe it might be possible to visit Albania if it wasn't too dangerous for two or three days to meet the family and to reconnect.

00:36:06.019 --> 00:36:11.019
It wasn't long after that that we unexpectedly got a letter from the governing body.

00:36:11.019 --> 00:36:15.019
And the letter said, we understand you're going to Albania for two or three days.

00:36:15.019 --> 00:36:20.019
We were wondering if you'd be willing to stay for two or three months and help with the kingdom work.

00:36:20.019 --> 00:36:23.019
We were really sure with that meant, but we were willing to try.

00:36:23.019 --> 00:36:28.019
The realities of the governing body had very limited information, but was happening in Albania.

00:36:28.019 --> 00:36:32.019
The work was under band. They didn't have a branch. They didn't have a congregation.

00:36:32.019 --> 00:36:34.019
Many of them didn't even know each other were still around.

00:36:34.019 --> 00:36:42.019
They didn't know if we could find housing there. If we could find food, the country was in a total economic crisis.

00:36:42.019 --> 00:36:45.019
Even with all the unknowns, we were still thrilled to go.

00:36:45.019 --> 00:36:50.019
And we knew, well, it's going to be two or three months, and you can do pretty much anything for two or three months.

00:36:50.019 --> 00:36:52.019
We're going to give it our best shot.

00:36:52.019 --> 00:36:56.019
Of course, once we arrived, we got a better picture. It was really happening.

00:36:56.019 --> 00:37:01.019
The infrastructure had actually collapsed. People are scrambling to get a new government up and going.

00:37:01.019 --> 00:37:03.019
It was quite difficult.

00:37:03.019 --> 00:37:07.019
But each assignment that we had prepared us for the next assignment.

00:37:07.019 --> 00:37:15.019
Having lived in the Dominican Republic where there were already limited resources, it didn't make it as quite as scary.

00:37:15.019 --> 00:37:19.019
It made that bridge a little easier for us to cross.

00:37:19.019 --> 00:37:24.019
Some of the first things that we had to do was try to see if we could find the old brothers and sisters.

00:37:24.019 --> 00:37:26.019
It was just a handful of them.

00:37:26.019 --> 00:37:34.019
And at the same time, we had to try to do what we could to meet with officials and see what could be done to help move the work forward legally.

00:37:34.019 --> 00:37:44.019
In the process of trying to get the work legalized, unexpectedly we found out that a brother from the United States who had Albanian background was coming to visit his relatives.

00:37:44.019 --> 00:37:50.019
And I said to one day, tomorrow I have a meeting with the ministry who's responsible to give us legalization.

00:37:50.019 --> 00:37:53.019
Would you like to come with me? Oh, I'd be delighted, he said.

00:37:53.019 --> 00:37:59.019
So we go to the office. When we got to the office, the minister wasn't there, but he sent his legal advisor out.

00:37:59.019 --> 00:38:06.019
And she made introductions and then she looked at the brother and she says, were you from any such and such a village.

00:38:06.019 --> 00:38:12.019
And she said, that's my village. It turned out to be that they were cousins.

00:38:12.019 --> 00:38:22.019
Now she looked everybody and she said, my goodness, I was already willing to help you because there was never a charter that I've read that's better written than yours.

00:38:22.019 --> 00:38:26.019
But now I have a family obligation.

00:38:26.019 --> 00:38:38.019
It was just a few days later we got a call and we had the document in our hands. Jehovah's Witnesses of Albania was finally legalized, the band was lifted after 50 years.

00:38:38.019 --> 00:38:45.019
After the work was legalized, we just saw Jehovah's Prayer work so mightily things were just moving forward in a way that we never expected.

00:38:45.019 --> 00:38:52.019
They were flooding into the meetings, young people, older people. They were really hungry for the truth.

00:38:53.019 --> 00:39:01.019
At the end of the three month assignment, the governing body kindly asked us, would you now be willing to stay since the work is legalized?

00:39:01.019 --> 00:39:11.690
Well, at this point, those folks had become so dear to our hearts that there was no way that we could leave. We couldn't leave our family and we were thrilled to be able to stay with them.

00:39:11.690 --> 00:39:18.690
We ended up serving in Albania just about 30 years and those 30 years went by very quickly.

00:39:18.690 --> 00:39:23.690
Who knew that a three day trip would turn into an assignment of a lifetime?

00:39:23.690 --> 00:39:33.690
When you allow yourself to go outside your comfort zone, you learn a lot about yourself, but you're also more useful to Jehovah, you're also in a better position to help other people.

00:39:33.690 --> 00:39:36.690
And that's an opportunity you never want to miss.

00:39:36.690 --> 00:39:41.690
And really never say no to an assignment just because we might be fearful of what the unknown is.

00:39:41.690 --> 00:39:46.690
When we put ourselves in Jehovah's hands, he's the one that will take on the responsibility to help us.

00:39:46.690 --> 00:39:52.690
So put them to the test, let him help us. He knows where to put us at the right time.

00:39:52.690 --> 00:39:58.690
And in reality, we're just a pencil in Jehovah's hands, letting him do the writing.

00:39:58.690 --> 00:40:11.000
Michael and Linda chose to serve in Albania for decades, even when it was hard.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:16.000
Today, over 5,000 witnesses served Jehovah in that land.

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:24.820
Now we'll examine the contrasting examples of humility of two men named Saul.

00:40:24.820 --> 00:40:31.820
Please enjoy this morning worship talk by Brother Jeffrey Jackson of the governing body.

00:40:31.820 --> 00:40:42.820
When we think of the matter of humility, we realize there are many examples in the Bible to help us some positive, some negative.

00:40:42.820 --> 00:40:53.820
Perhaps now we could just think for a few moments about one negative example and one positive example of two men who both had the name Saul.

00:40:53.820 --> 00:40:59.820
The first one we'll think about is the man who became known as King Saul of Israel.

00:40:59.820 --> 00:41:05.820
If you'd like to take your Bibles, please, and turn with me to the beginning of the book of First Samuel.

00:41:05.820 --> 00:41:12.820
You'll notice the outline of contents that gives us an overview of what happened at that particular time.

00:41:12.820 --> 00:41:20.820
So in that outline of contents, we noticed there in chapter 10, it says, Saul anointed to be King.

00:41:20.820 --> 00:41:23.820
Do you remember the circumstances?

00:41:23.820 --> 00:41:26.820
At that point was Saul proud?

00:41:26.820 --> 00:41:33.820
Was he presenting himself as the man, the one who would lead the nation into a new era?

00:41:33.820 --> 00:41:39.820
No, we remember how the Scriptures described that he was hiding in the luggage.

00:41:39.820 --> 00:41:42.820
So he didn't want a prominent position.

00:41:42.820 --> 00:41:45.820
He was hesitant to take that role.

00:41:45.820 --> 00:41:48.820
But Jehovah blessed him and he was anointed.

00:41:48.820 --> 00:41:54.820
And if we look on a little further, we see in chapter 11 that he defeats the Ammonites.

00:41:54.820 --> 00:41:59.820
At that point it does specifically say that Jehovah's spirit was with him.

00:41:59.820 --> 00:42:06.820
Also, there's mention of the fact that humbly, he did not retaliate against those who opposed him.

00:42:06.820 --> 00:42:12.820
But when we looked down at chapter 13, what does it say there?

00:42:12.820 --> 00:42:15.820
Saul acts presumptuously.

00:42:15.820 --> 00:42:21.820
So he had lost his humility and lost Jehovah's favor.

00:42:21.820 --> 00:42:24.820
How long into his rulership was this?

00:42:24.820 --> 00:42:27.820
Well, if we look at chapter 13, verse 1,

00:42:27.820 --> 00:42:35.820
it tells us that it was right at the beginning maybe just two or three years had passed at this point.

00:42:35.820 --> 00:42:37.820
So what does that tell us?

00:42:37.820 --> 00:42:42.820
He lost his humility very quickly after being anointed as king.

00:42:42.820 --> 00:42:51.820
Not only that, but Jehovah allowed him to continue on in that position for perhaps over 35 years.

00:42:51.820 --> 00:42:55.820
So what lessons do we learn from that with regard to ourselves?

00:42:55.820 --> 00:43:03.820
Well, the first lesson is, perhaps before being appointed to be an elder or some other service privilege,

00:43:03.820 --> 00:43:08.820
we may have been hesitant, we may have been humble, we may not have wanted that particular position,

00:43:08.820 --> 00:43:11.820
we may have felt we weren't qualified.

00:43:11.820 --> 00:43:14.820
Maybe we were very humble in our viewpoint.

00:43:14.820 --> 00:43:20.820
But remember the case of King Saul, how quickly, once he got appointed in that position,

00:43:20.820 --> 00:43:23.820
how quickly he lost humility.

00:43:23.820 --> 00:43:31.820
The second lesson is that just because we remain in a certain role, position of authority,

00:43:31.820 --> 00:43:38.820
does not in itself prove that Jehovah approves of us or that we are remaining humble.

00:43:38.820 --> 00:43:46.820
So that's why it's so important for us to continually analyze ourselves to see if we are remaining humble,

00:43:46.820 --> 00:43:52.820
and we do still have that humility that we perhaps exhibited many years ago.

00:43:53.820 --> 00:44:01.820
Now the second example we'd like to discuss is that of Saul who became well known as the Apostle Paul.

00:44:01.820 --> 00:44:04.820
Well, how was Saul's start?

00:44:04.820 --> 00:44:09.820
Was he a humble man? Was he like the man who became king Saul?

00:44:09.820 --> 00:44:12.820
Was he hiding in the luggage? No, he was right there in the front.

00:44:12.820 --> 00:44:20.820
In fact, in 1 Timothy 1 verse 13, the Apostle Paul describes himself in those days as an insolent man,

00:44:21.820 --> 00:44:28.820
and that expression can indicate someone who speaks in a very downgrading way to others,

00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:35.820
humiliates them, and certainly would show a very proud, arrogant man.

00:44:35.820 --> 00:44:39.820
And yet what happened to this man's Saul?

00:44:39.820 --> 00:44:47.820
Well, he progressed, became a Christian, and Jehovah's Spirit helped him to become a very humble person.

00:44:47.820 --> 00:44:52.820
Now how do we know that the Apostle Paul really was very humble?

00:44:52.820 --> 00:44:59.820
Well, there are many things that we could mention, but perhaps let's just talk about one particular aspect.

00:44:59.820 --> 00:45:02.820
I'm going to ask a question for you to answer yourself.

00:45:02.820 --> 00:45:09.820
Do you think the Apostle Paul was an eloquent speaker? Was he very good at speaking to others?

00:45:09.820 --> 00:45:13.820
Your initial reaction might be to say, no.

00:45:13.820 --> 00:45:17.820
Let's think a little bit more before we give a definite answer.

00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:21.820
When we look at the book of Acts, what do we see?

00:45:21.820 --> 00:45:26.820
We see recorded there many of the speeches that the Apostle Paul gave.

00:45:26.820 --> 00:45:31.820
In Antioch, he gave a very, very effective witness.

00:45:31.820 --> 00:45:34.820
In Listera, remember when he and Barnabas were there?

00:45:34.820 --> 00:45:41.820
The people thought that he was Hermes because he was taking the lead in speaking at that time.

00:45:42.820 --> 00:45:50.820
How often have we referred to Acts 17 where Paul, in a very skillful manner, in a very difficult circumstance,

00:45:50.820 --> 00:45:56.820
was able to preach to people using this altar for an unknown God,

00:45:56.820 --> 00:46:01.820
even quoted from some of the local prophets or, sorry, the poets?

00:46:01.820 --> 00:46:08.820
So this helps us to see that he was a very effective person when he spoke to others.

00:46:08.820 --> 00:46:13.820
On the steps when he was taken from the temple and the crowd wanted to kill him,

00:46:13.820 --> 00:46:17.820
he again gave a very effective speech.

00:46:17.820 --> 00:46:22.820
Not to mention, of course, a number of times that he spoke before many of the Gentile rulers

00:46:22.820 --> 00:46:25.820
and gave a very effective witness.

00:46:25.820 --> 00:46:30.820
So now how are we feeling about the Apostle Paul's ability to speak?

00:46:30.820 --> 00:46:35.820
Well, probably with thinking, he must have been a very eloquent speaker.

00:46:35.820 --> 00:46:40.820
He could really project the message and persuade others.

00:46:40.820 --> 00:46:46.820
But now, why was there a little hesitancy on our part to say Paul was an excellent speaker?

00:46:46.820 --> 00:46:48.820
Well, maybe it comes from one scripture.

00:46:48.820 --> 00:46:54.820
Let's look at 2 Corinthians chapter 11 and verse 6.

00:46:54.820 --> 00:46:59.820
And here the Apostle Paul speaking to the brothers in Corinth says,

00:46:59.820 --> 00:47:07.820
but even if I am unskilled in speech, I certainly am not in knowledge.

00:47:07.820 --> 00:47:11.820
Was Paul saying here he didn't know how to speak?

00:47:11.820 --> 00:47:16.820
No, he was answering the super-fine apostles who criticized him,

00:47:16.820 --> 00:47:20.820
who spoke in a very disparaging manner with regard to him.

00:47:20.820 --> 00:47:23.820
In fact, they even said his speech was contemptible.

00:47:23.820 --> 00:47:25.820
And when Paul says here,

00:47:25.820 --> 00:47:32.820
but even if I am unskilled, is he really saying he wasn't skilled in speaking?

00:47:32.820 --> 00:47:38.820
No, he was answering them according to their own standards that they had set up.

00:47:38.820 --> 00:47:42.820
So with that in mind, we might ask a question,

00:47:42.820 --> 00:47:46.820
why is it the brothers in Corinth, perhaps, had this impression

00:47:46.820 --> 00:47:51.820
after what we've just considered with regard to Paul's background?

00:47:51.820 --> 00:47:57.820
Well, let's have a look at 1 Corinthians, and this brings us back to the matter of humility.

00:47:57.820 --> 00:48:00.820
So 1 Corinthians chapter 2,

00:48:00.820 --> 00:48:03.820
and we're going to read together verses 1 through 5.

00:48:03.820 --> 00:48:08.650
So when I came to you, brothers,

00:48:08.650 --> 00:48:16.650
I did not come with extravagant speech or wisdom declaring the sacred secret of God to you.

00:48:16.650 --> 00:48:20.650
So Paul deliberately did not come to them

00:48:20.650 --> 00:48:25.650
with using all the debating methods that the Corinthians were used to.

00:48:25.650 --> 00:48:28.650
Notice in verse 2 what it tells us,

00:48:28.650 --> 00:48:35.650
for I decided not to know anything among you except Jesus Christ

00:48:35.650 --> 00:48:37.650
and him executed on the stake.

00:48:37.650 --> 00:48:42.650
This was a deliberate decision on the part of the apostle Paul,

00:48:42.650 --> 00:48:48.650
not to use this extravagant speech, this wisdom that he could have used.

00:48:48.650 --> 00:48:52.650
And notice in verses 3 through 5 how he continues on.

00:48:52.650 --> 00:48:56.650
And I came to you in weakness and in fear and with much trembling

00:48:56.650 --> 00:49:01.650
and my speech and what I preached were not with persuasive words of wisdom

00:49:01.650 --> 00:49:06.650
but with a demonstration of spirit and power.

00:49:06.650 --> 00:49:13.650
So that your faith might be not on men's wisdom but in God's power.

00:49:13.650 --> 00:49:15.650
What is Paul saying here?

00:49:15.650 --> 00:49:19.650
He realized the brothers and Corinth had a problem.

00:49:19.650 --> 00:49:25.650
They put too much emphasis on worldly wisdom in the way that people presented themselves.

00:49:25.650 --> 00:49:30.650
No doubt that was part of why they had divisions in the congregation.

00:49:30.650 --> 00:49:34.650
So Paul trying to avoid that situation and putting emphasis

00:49:34.650 --> 00:49:38.650
truly on Jehovah's Holy Spirit and the power of the message

00:49:38.650 --> 00:49:43.650
decided not to use this so-called wisdom that he could have used.

00:49:43.650 --> 00:49:47.650
Isn't that a very humble action on his part?

00:49:47.650 --> 00:49:50.650
He was willing to be thought of badly.

00:49:50.650 --> 00:49:53.650
He was willing to have people say that he couldn't speak properly

00:49:53.650 --> 00:49:57.650
because he wanted to focus the glory on Jehovah.

00:49:57.650 --> 00:50:00.650
What do we learn from this example?

00:50:00.650 --> 00:50:04.650
Well, we see that an arrogant person can become humble.

00:50:04.650 --> 00:50:09.650
But also we see that at times we may decide if we are humble

00:50:09.650 --> 00:50:16.650
not to display the wisdom and talents that we have perhaps to downplay them

00:50:16.650 --> 00:50:20.650
so that the glory goes to Jehovah.

00:50:20.650 --> 00:50:23.650
So what an interesting set of examples for us.

00:50:24.650 --> 00:50:28.650
May we never be like King Saul who lost his humility

00:50:28.650 --> 00:50:33.650
and may we be like the Apostle Paul who continued to be humble,

00:50:33.650 --> 00:50:39.650
willing to put himself down in order for Jehovah's glory to be in the fore.

00:50:39.650 --> 00:50:42.650
A humble person can become proud.

00:50:42.650 --> 00:50:49.650
But Paul is inspiring proof that a proud and arrogant person can become humble.

00:50:49.650 --> 00:50:54.650
He humbly allowed Jehovah to mold him.

00:50:54.650 --> 00:51:00.650
Humbly placing ourselves in Jehovah's loving hands is the theme of a new music video,

00:51:00.650 --> 00:51:05.650
which tells the story of a person who learns the truth while imprisoned.

00:51:05.650 --> 00:51:14.650
Jehovah, my God, your eyes can see an imperfect heart inside of me.

00:51:14.650 --> 00:51:25.650
Still, I try to serve you loyally when my words get away without restraint

00:51:25.650 --> 00:51:30.650
or things that I do don't bring you praise.

00:51:30.650 --> 00:51:37.650
I beg you, please keep working with me.

00:51:38.650 --> 00:51:44.650
I look to you, my father, I am the clay.

00:51:44.650 --> 00:51:52.760
You are my puddle, shaping me into something new.

00:51:52.760 --> 00:52:04.309
Something that brings praise to you, someone I smile to your face.

00:52:05.309 --> 00:52:09.309
Mold me with your loving care.

00:52:09.309 --> 00:52:14.309
Help me to draw close in prayer.

00:52:14.309 --> 00:52:54.309
My father hit your word and calling to mind the things I've heard.

00:52:54.309 --> 00:53:04.250
Please put with him that helps me each day to make a new start.

00:53:04.250 --> 00:53:44.789
You won't let my mistakes define to you to something in prayer.

00:53:44.789 --> 00:54:57.380
If at times you're discouraged by your flaws or struggle to make changes in your life,

00:54:57.380 --> 00:55:05.019
be assured that Jehovah helps those who approach him with a humble heart.

00:55:05.019 --> 00:55:13.019
As we've explored in our program, humility is an endearing quality that enriches our lives.

00:55:13.019 --> 00:55:17.019
It helps us lovingly resolve conflicts and marriage.

00:55:17.019 --> 00:55:22.019
It moves us to treat others in a way acceptable to Jehovah,

00:55:22.019 --> 00:55:29.380
and it opens our minds to other methods of preaching.

00:55:29.380 --> 00:55:37.380
This month's postcard comes to us from Myanmar in Southeast Asia, also called Burma.

00:55:37.380 --> 00:55:44.380
Some describe Myanmar as being shaped like a kite with its tail running along the Malay Peninsula.

00:55:44.380 --> 00:55:49.380
Earlier settlers called Myanmar the Golden Land.

00:55:49.380 --> 00:55:53.380
It's a land of vast natural resources.

00:55:53.380 --> 00:56:00.380
Myanmar's forest produced valued timbers like teak and rosewood.

00:56:00.380 --> 00:56:06.380
The land is rich in silver, copper, sapphires and rubies.

00:56:06.380 --> 00:56:12.380
The people are known to be gentle, considerate and hospitable.

00:56:12.380 --> 00:56:19.380
Eight major ethnic groups live in Myanmar, each with its own language and culture.

00:56:19.380 --> 00:56:24.380
Personal names are usually composed of several descriptive words.

00:56:24.380 --> 00:56:31.380
For example, the name Chow Sendai Mi means sweet moon above.

00:56:31.380 --> 00:56:39.380
Visitors to Myanmar quickly notice the yellow paste that adorns the faces of most women and children.

00:56:39.380 --> 00:56:45.380
It's called Venaka, made from the bark of the Venaka tree.

00:56:45.380 --> 00:56:51.380
This natural cosmetic cools and protects the skin from the tropical sun.

00:56:51.380 --> 00:56:56.380
And it's been used for over 2,000 years.

00:56:56.380 --> 00:57:03.380
The preaching work began here in 1914 with the arrival of two Bible students.

00:57:03.380 --> 00:57:13.380
Missionaries followed and by 1939, three congregations totaling 28 witnesses had been established.

00:57:13.380 --> 00:57:21.380
In the 1940s, a pioneer sister contacted members of the ethnic group known as the Corinne.

00:57:21.380 --> 00:57:30.380
Himmei, also known as Lily and her sister Choumei, are Daisy, learn the truth from her.

00:57:30.380 --> 00:57:35.380
Lily became the first Corinne to be baptized as a witness at Jehovah.

00:57:35.380 --> 00:57:41.380
Daisy was also baptized and both became zealous pioneers.

00:57:41.380 --> 00:57:50.380
Hundreds of their descendants and Bible students are among the thousands who served Jehovah in Myanmar today.

00:57:50.380 --> 00:57:57.380
They persevered despite poverty, political upheaval, religious persecution and war.

00:57:58.380 --> 00:58:02.380
Our brothers preach in over 20 languages.

00:58:02.380 --> 00:58:12.380
In 2024, Myanmar reported an all-time peak of publishers, nearly 12,000 people attended the memorial.

00:58:12.380 --> 00:58:23.380
The Pado congregation is located in a small village in the Bugo region, 86 publishers and four special pioneers serve here.

00:58:23.380 --> 00:58:32.380
Our brothers and sisters in the Pado congregation and the Lai Remote Translation Office send you their love.

00:58:32.380 --> 00:58:38.380
From the World Headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses, this is J.W. Broadcasting.
