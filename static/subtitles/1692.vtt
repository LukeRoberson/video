00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:10.250
I lived in the north with the glorious dark starlit sky and the beauty of furtries.

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:13.250
I thought it was the most wonderful place in the world.

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:17.250
My mom was always drawing my attention to the beauty of creation.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.250
And she always told me, my daughter, it's so important to live your life in the right way.

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.250
And the question that stayed with me was, so why are we alive?

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.250
Why is there so much suffering in justice, pain?

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:36.780
When I was 18, I took up a form of karate known as Ku Kushinkai.

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.780
Just imagine a large number of people in Kamono standing in rows,

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.780
grieving without a shadow of fear working on improving their blows and striving to progress.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.780
I thought, this is it, this is what I've been looking for.

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.780
I set the goal of reaching the next world championships,

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.780
winning a high place and immortalizing myself,

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.780
so that my name would remain and generations would remember me.

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:06.780
Among those sportsmen, I always saw a lot of nice words and slogans,

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.780
not everything was as pure as I'd hoped for.

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.829
And then on one occasion I was sitting down,

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:18.829
and feelings of emptiness just wouldn't leave me alone.

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:22.829
And for the first time in my life, I talked to God,

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:27.829
and then I prayed, I don't understand you.

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:33.109
Why is there so much beauty in the world?

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:36.109
And yet so much suffering.

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:40.109
Is that really what you want for us to live like this?

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:43.109
I prayed, I guess, for about four hours.

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:47.109
You know, the strongest feeling of emptiness and loneliness

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:51.109
is out of a creation, without its creator.

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:54.109
And I was so lonely at that time.

00:01:54.109 --> 00:02:00.579
And a while afterwards, there was a knock at my door.

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:05.590
It was Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.590
I started studying the Bible.

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.590
It was so wonderful.

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.610
On one occasion, the sister who studied with me,

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.610
looked up at me, and when she looked at those bruises,

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.610
those beaten up knuckles,

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.610
she took a deep breath and shook her head.

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.610
I said, is there something wrong?

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.610
She said, you know, I'm in great pain.

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.610
I said, why are you in pain?

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.610
She said, well, I'm looking at your hands, your elbows,

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.610
your battered legs, all of that, doesn't it hurt?

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.610
I said, well, yes.

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:48.610
And she said, you know, it hurts me to see you in pain.

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.610
And I started to understand that Jehovah is the true God,

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.610
that this really was the truth.

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:56.610
It was difficult.

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.610
The pressure from relatives and friends was very strong.

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.610
But the most difficult thing that I had to battle with

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.610
was my strong attachment to karate.

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.610
Just a year remained until the World Championships.

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.610
I had prepared for them.

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.610
I had been working toward that goal for five years.

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.610
Glory can seem really sweet when you are the victor,

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.610
when your opponents fall to the ground.

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:29.800
So I flew to the World Championships.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.800
When I made it to the last four winners

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.800
and I had to fight for third place,

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.800
I wanted to ask my trainer to stop.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:37.800
Why?

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.800
Because I couldn't feel a single life place on my body.

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.800
Everything was beaten up.

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.800
But he said, you know, we love you so much.

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.800
Go for it.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.800
And at that moment, it felt as though I was weighing love.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.800
The world's love and the love of Jehovah's organization.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.800
It seemed to me that the world was saying, we love you.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.800
Now just go and die.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:07.800
But the love in the organization says, it hurts me to see you in pain.

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.800
I realized that the world can't give you what it doesn't have.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.800
It doesn't know how to love.

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:18.800
But nevertheless, I went to the fight and became the bronze medalist.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:23.750
And when I stood on the podium of glory,

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.750
I understood that glory among people who don't love you

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.750
weighs no more than emptiness.

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.750
If a person dedicates his life to glorifying himself,

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.750
he will always meet with disappointment and emptiness.

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.750
So I made the firm decision to escape from karate.

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.750
I started preaching and I was baptized in 2005

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:48.750
at the summer convention in Korgans.

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:53.290
Later, I started full-time service.

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:57.290
I learned the Tatar language so that I could serve in that territory.

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:02.920
Now, when in the evenings I look up at the starry sky,

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:06.920
I feel not hopelessness, but tremendous joy

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:09.920
because I know who's behind it all.

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:13.920
Our loving creator, Jehovah God.
