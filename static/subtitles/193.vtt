00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:06.450
In addressing our theme, is your best good enough?

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.189
I like to start by reading Galatians 6.4.

00:00:12.189 --> 00:00:18.589
He says, but let each one examine his own actions, and then he will have cause for rejoicing

00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:25.429
in regard to himself alone and not in comparison with the other person.

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:28.309
We're told to examine our own actions.

00:00:28.309 --> 00:00:32.829
To ask yourself, how am I doing spiritually?

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:36.509
Am I happy with my attendance at Christian meetings?

00:00:36.509 --> 00:00:41.869
Do I participate by sharing meaningful comments as able?

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:44.789
How about my personal study of the Bible?

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.710
Let me examine my involvement in the ministry.

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.390
Could I do better in preparing for my return visit?

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.509
Do I conduct any Bible studies with interested ones?

00:00:57.509 --> 00:01:02.229
Are so am I content with what I am doing?

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:08.469
In effect, you're asking yourself, is my best good enough?

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:13.989
We might see others in the congregation that are doing more than we are.

00:01:13.989 --> 00:01:22.230
But then we look back at Galatians 6.4 again, and it clearly said that I should not compare

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:24.909
myself with the other person.

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:33.310
So we could quickly assume that we're doing what we can, reasoning that is good enough.

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.590
But let's not forget the first part of the verse.

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.790
We are to examine our own actions.

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:50.349
We need to compare what we are doing with what we personally could be doing.

00:01:50.349 --> 00:01:57.849
We need to be active and not become self-satisfied and overconfident.

00:01:57.849 --> 00:02:01.329
First Corinthians 10-12 provides this warning.

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:06.209
So let the one who thinks he is standing beware that he does not fall.

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:13.490
But you may say, I'm doing my best, what more can I do?

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.930
Take a good look at your best, scrutinize it.

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:23.530
Examine very closely all you're doing with the time that you have.

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.849
Can mundane activity be replaced with theocratic activity?

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:30.849
What do you see?

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:33.409
Is your best good enough?

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:37.169
It may be, it may not.

00:02:37.169 --> 00:02:40.330
It depends on one's outlook.

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.330
What are some examples?

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:53.289
A runner and a race, he practices, trains, eats the right things, keeps a lean, healthy body,

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:58.090
wears the best running shoes, and so forth.

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:04.169
He gives his best, but loses the race to someone faster.

00:03:04.169 --> 00:03:07.770
His best was not good enough.

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.289
Why?

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:14.090
It was compared to whether he was faster than his competitors.

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:25.090
Johann Blake lost to Usain the Bolt in a 100-meter event in 2012 by just a fraction of a second.

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:32.169
He did his best, but his best wasn't good enough.

00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:34.129
A mother and daughter.

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:37.409
The daughter is in the second grade of school.

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:41.250
She brings home a picture, she drew in class.

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.009
The teacher had put a B minus on the picture.

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:53.530
The daughter shows it to her mother, and the mother crosses out the B minus and puts an A plus on it.

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:58.650
She then tapes the picture on the refrigerator.

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.409
What is the difference between the teacher and the mother?

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:08.409
The teacher compares the student to other classmates of her age.

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:15.789
The mother grades her according to her best, not in comparison with others.

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:21.509
Jehovah does not compare your best with the best of others.

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:25.110
Let's look at Psalm 103, 14.

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:34.310
When Jehovah examines our spiritual accomplishments, what's one of his measuring sticks?

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:37.949
Psalm 103, 14.

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:45.589
For he well knows how we are formed, remembering that we are dust.

00:04:45.589 --> 00:04:52.069
Dust is used figuratively, indicating the mankind's frailty and aloliness.

00:04:52.069 --> 00:04:59.870
Remembering that we are dust, Jehovah never asks more of us than we can give.

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:08.509
However, he expects us to obey his commands to the best of our own ability.

00:05:08.509 --> 00:05:11.149
Mark 12, 30.

00:05:11.149 --> 00:05:15.829
You can likely quote it from memory, verse 30 says,

00:05:15.829 --> 00:05:30.790
You must love Jehovah your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole mind and with your whole strength.

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:35.910
This embraces everything we have, all that we are.

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:37.750
You go in service.

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:41.350
You use your whole strength to accomplish it.

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:43.350
That's commendable.

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:59.269
But what good is it to use our whole strength, going into service, if our mind cannot direct our tongue to say the right things when we talk to a person?

00:05:59.269 --> 00:06:06.230
I used a lot of my strength walking from door to door, climbing stairs and so forth.

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:11.949
And yet no one let me get past my introduction.

00:06:11.949 --> 00:06:18.110
Question was that the best introduction you could get?

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:22.189
How long have you been using that introduction?

00:06:22.189 --> 00:06:24.589
Would a new one help?

00:06:24.589 --> 00:06:34.430
Would using your whole mind by means of advanced preparation result in making your best even better?

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:40.670
Have you tried to use some of the introductions demonstrated at our midweek meetings?

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:48.110
Or some of those found in the reasoning from the Scriptures book, pages 9 through 15?

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:53.470
What does the householder see in your face when she opens the door?

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:58.670
Is your countenance radiating pleasantness and kindness?

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:02.829
Does she see good news or bad news?

00:07:02.829 --> 00:07:06.350
Do you look happy or sad?

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:13.470
The message we're commissioned to deliver today is the good news of the Kingdom.

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:17.709
We expect it to change sometime in the near future.

00:07:17.709 --> 00:07:21.949
Do the best you can until you know better.

00:07:21.949 --> 00:07:27.949
Then when you know better, you can do better.

00:07:27.949 --> 00:07:33.870
You attend all congregation meetings and pay rapt attention with your mind.

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:35.470
You're to be commended.

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:42.350
But is that all that's required to love Jehovah with our whole mind?

00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:52.829
Are we meditating on the knowledge that we receive at our meetings in order to draw close to Jehovah?

00:07:52.829 --> 00:08:00.509
James 4.8 says, draw close to God and He will draw close to you.

00:08:00.509 --> 00:08:06.189
That's one benefit we receive from our meeting attendants.

00:08:06.189 --> 00:08:14.079
Let's read Hebrews 1024 and 25.

00:08:14.079 --> 00:08:17.759
This is another benefit of regular meeting attendants.

00:08:17.759 --> 00:08:23.040
In this way, we give and receive in encouragement.

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:29.600
Verse 24 and 25 read, and let us consider one another

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:34.480
so as to incite to love and fine works.

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:39.679
Not for seeking our meeting together as some have the custom,

00:08:39.679 --> 00:08:48.080
but encouraging one another and all the more so as you see the day drawing near.

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:53.519
Do you give comments of meetings? Are they well prepared?

00:08:53.519 --> 00:08:56.960
Do they encourage your brothers and sisters?

00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:04.799
Are you giving your best? If so, then your best is good enough.

00:09:04.799 --> 00:09:10.399
What about your personal study or family worship?

00:09:10.399 --> 00:09:16.480
Are you doing your best? Is your best good enough?

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:21.679
I read all the watchtowers and the legs when they come out, you say.

00:09:21.679 --> 00:09:25.440
It goes without saying that that's good.

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:30.799
What did you find in what you read that will deepen your love

00:09:30.799 --> 00:09:37.600
and appreciation for Jehovah and draw you closer to Him?

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:44.639
Do you use your whole mind to meditate and continue to think about it?

00:09:44.639 --> 00:09:49.679
Thus spiking it down deep into your heart.

00:09:49.679 --> 00:09:54.720
Some things we learn may not be immediately applicable,

00:09:54.720 --> 00:10:01.200
but can be regurgitated and applied later as needed.

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:05.840
Are you giving serious attention to the spiritual needs of your wife

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:11.679
and children? Yes, you have a family worship most weeks.

00:10:11.679 --> 00:10:18.240
That's commendable. Do you prepare well for it or just throw something together

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:24.000
at the last minute? What if your wife just threw something on the table

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.840
for dinner each evening without giving any thought

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:32.639
to the health needs of the family? Thank you.

00:10:32.639 --> 00:10:40.559
Is your best good enough? We can slap a pig and he'll enjoy it,

00:10:40.559 --> 00:10:45.840
but give the same garbage to a cow and she'll ignore it.

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:51.039
Why are we considering is your best good enough?

00:10:51.039 --> 00:10:58.159
It's only as a reminder to look at what we think to be our best

00:10:58.159 --> 00:11:02.159
in what we're doing for ourselves, our families,

00:11:02.159 --> 00:11:07.679
and our spiritual brothers and sisters. And remember,

00:11:07.679 --> 00:11:13.679
our best is not compare with the best of another brother or sister.

00:11:13.679 --> 00:11:23.679
Only Jehovah knows when we're doing our best. He is a righteous and fair judge.

00:11:23.679 --> 00:11:30.720
Our knowledge, even of ourself, can be faulty due to inherited sin.

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:35.200
Therefore, it's wisdom on our part to keep examining ourselves

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:41.919
to see where we might improve. So is your best good enough?

00:11:41.919 --> 00:11:49.120
I'd like to think it is. What do you think?
