00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:11.759
My name is Ray Balthasar Perlarrivas and I am from El Salvador, Central America.

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:20.039
I was a civil engineer sent by the United States government to Harvard University at Cambridge,

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.239
Massachusetts, for Apple's graduate course.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:32.560
Well, I really didn't know the president personally, nor did he know me.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:37.679
But he knew of me as the engineer, the how to private firm,

00:00:37.679 --> 00:00:44.079
and that worked at the hydroelectric plant that was being built for the Lempere River.

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:48.880
He phoned me and said, say, do you want to be a member of my cabinet?

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:58.100
I became a member of the cabinet in the government, serving as a minister of public works.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:03.780
I learned the truth through a missionary, Sister Charlotte Schroeder.

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.140
She showed me the book, one house religion done for mankind,

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.859
and right then and there we started to study the Bible.

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:18.739
I came into the truth gradually, not all at once,

00:01:18.739 --> 00:01:24.500
because I wanted to be convinced of what I was learning each day.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:31.140
I was used to studying things deeply, but I want to tell you,

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:43.469
when I learned the truth, I really learned how to think, how I should think.

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:47.390
I said to him, I'm resigning and I just resigned,

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.989
so I wasn't there for the remainder of his presidency.

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:57.870
He was shocked and told me, I wanted you to be my successor.

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.670
It wasn't difficult for me to get out of politics,

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:11.550
because I was already convinced that the Bible was the truth.

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.909
Look, Alvaro, I said to him, I have come to talk to you,

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:18.509
not as the president, but as a man.

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:21.389
Your government is going to win.

00:02:21.389 --> 00:02:25.069
And I gave him a sermon and said to him, here's the Bible.

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:31.219
There is no comparison whatsoever.

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:35.860
Today, whether in the morning, at noon, in the afternoon, or at night,

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.699
I only think of the truth.

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:41.139
When I see the politicians, I feel pity for them.

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:45.699
The benefit I have because of knowing the truth

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:50.020
is that I can worship God for only eternity,

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.580
with a view to living the real life.

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.860
That is my sole purpose.

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.259
I am waiting, but I can see that when the Bible says,

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:04.419
I am making all things new.

00:03:04.419 --> 00:03:07.620
He means that everything is going to be different.
