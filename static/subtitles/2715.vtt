Throughout Jesus' ministry, he taught about God's kingdom more than any other subject.

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:20.079
For centuries, his followers have prayed for that kingdom to come.

00:00:20.079 --> 00:00:29.109
But what is the kingdom? A kingdom is a type of government.

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:38.359
A government includes a ruler, a seat of government, a territory that is ruled over,

00:00:38.359 --> 00:00:51.590
laws and citizens. Sadly, many human governments fail to meet the needs of their people,

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.590
advancing their own interests instead.

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:02.590
In contrast, God's kingdom has the perfect ruler, Jesus.

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:11.590
Someone God Himself chose to be king. God also selects others to be associate rulers with Jesus.

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:19.590
This kingdom rules from heaven. It receives its power and authority from God.

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:26.590
Its domain will include the whole earth, eliminating problems caused by nationalism.

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.590
And anyone who obeys its laws can be a citizen.
