00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:05.040
What are your convenient times?

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:11.279
Our text for today discusses one of the temptations that Satan presented to Jesus.

00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:18.239
At Luke 4 and verse 13, later says, that then Satan goes away to return at another convenient

00:00:18.239 --> 00:00:20.600
time to tempt Jesus.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.719
So with all that in mind, we're going to consider three questions today.

00:00:23.719 --> 00:00:28.640
At number one, what were these three temptations really about?

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:36.479
At number two, did Satan ever find a convenient time to come back and tempt Jesus?

00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:40.679
And three, does Satan try to use these temptations today?

00:00:40.679 --> 00:00:44.240
We're going to look at Matthew's account of these three temptations and try to answer

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.240
those questions.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:50.320
So let's start first with Matthew chapter 4 and verse 2 and 3.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.719
It says, after he had fasted for 40 days and 40 nights, he felt hungry.

00:00:55.719 --> 00:01:01.799
In the temptor approach, and said to him, if you are a son of God, tell these stones

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:04.640
to become lows of bread.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.159
Our first question, what was it the root of this temptation?

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:14.000
Well, Satan knew full well that Jesus was Jehovah's firstborn son, but he was trying

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.480
to get Jesus to question that he was who Jehovah said he was.

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:25.680
If you are a son of God, why hasn't your father fed you?

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:28.640
Can you really trust Jehovah to take care of you?

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:35.079
See, Satan wanted Jesus to begin to question Jehovah's care and use his position to benefit

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:36.079
himself.

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:41.599
Well, Jesus recognized that this was a temptation and he did not fall for it.

00:01:41.599 --> 00:01:47.799
But question two, did Satan ever come back and try this trick again with Jesus?

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:52.239
Well, when Jesus was arrested, could that have been a convenient time?

00:01:52.239 --> 00:01:56.680
Remember Jesus said that he could have called on 12 legions of angels to come and save

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:57.680
him?

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.560
Could that have been a temptation to save himself?

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:07.439
Or remember when he was on the stake, the rulers and the soldiers at haunted him and

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:13.280
said, if you are a son of God, come on down off the stake.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.879
Interesting that they used the same terminology.

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:17.520
Could that have been a temptation?

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.000
No, Jesus trusted that Jehovah would take care of him.

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:26.960
Our third question is, does Satan use that temptation today?

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.680
Well, we are living in unsettled times.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.680
Are these convenient times for Satan?

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.120
Are families, are friends, maybe in need?

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.840
Could we be tempted to question if we really trust that Jehovah is going to take care

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.159
of them?

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:47.400
Do we, could we be convinced or convince ourselves that we may need to take matters into

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.960
our own hands?

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:54.680
Or are we ever tempted to use our privileges of service to benefit ourselves?

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.680
So could the second temptation, Matthew 4, verses 5 and 6?

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.080
Says then the devil took him along into the holy city and stationed him on the battlemen

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:10.080
of the temple and said to him, if you are a son of God, throw yourself down for it is

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:15.240
written, he will give his angels a command concerning you and they will carry you on

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:19.560
their hands so that you may not strike your foot against a stone.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.159
Again, what was the root here?

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:26.960
Well, Satan was again trying to cast doubt on who Jesus was.

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.759
If you are who you say you are, prove it.

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:35.960
Let's say if Jehovah really is there for you, he does value you, he'll save you because

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:40.439
Psalm says that's what he'll do for the real son of God.

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:44.240
Well Jesus saw that this was a temptation and did not fall for it.

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:48.280
Now did Satan ever try such a temptation again?

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:54.680
Well perhaps another time is what's recorded in Mark 8, verse 11, where the Pharisees

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:55.680
came.

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:01.439
The account says they started disputing with him, demanding from him a sign from heaven

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:02.680
to put him to the test.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:08.960
Now Jesus had just healed a deaf and speechless man and miraculously fed over 4,000 people,

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:10.120
but that wasn't enough for them.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:16.639
They wanted something spectacular, like throw yourself off the temple or something.

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:20.000
Approve you are who you say you are.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.439
Let's see if Jehovah really values you.

00:04:23.439 --> 00:04:27.000
Now when might we face a similar temptation?

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.879
Well some of our brothers and sisters may feel unlovable due to events in their life.

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:39.759
Times of isolation, depression may be convenient times for those times for Satan to attack

00:04:39.839 --> 00:04:40.920
them.

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.319
Am I sure Jehovah really loves me?

00:04:43.319 --> 00:04:45.240
Am I sure I'm important to Jehovah?

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.240
Do I have value?

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:53.399
Well such feelings have caused ones to stop serving Jehovah or to seek validation of their

00:04:53.399 --> 00:04:57.319
value through unscriptural means.

00:04:57.319 --> 00:05:02.360
Look at our third temptation, Matthew 4, verses 8 and 9.

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:06.720
Again the devil took him along to an unusually high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.839
of the world in their glory.

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:14.319
And he said to him, all these things I will give you if you fall down into an act of worship

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:15.839
to me.

00:05:15.839 --> 00:05:18.120
So what was Satan offering here?

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.199
Don't wait.

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:20.199
You can have it now.

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:21.199
You know it's coming.

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:22.519
The pain that's coming.

00:05:22.519 --> 00:05:25.160
My offer is better than Jehovah's.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:30.839
Again, Jesus recognized what Satan was doing and he resisted that temptation.

00:05:30.839 --> 00:05:34.839
Did Satan ever find a convenient time to try that again?

00:05:34.839 --> 00:05:39.759
Well perhaps the account in Luke 6 and verse 15 explains what may have been another

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:40.759
convenient time.

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:44.439
Remember the people that wanted Jesus to begin ruling right then?

00:05:44.439 --> 00:05:48.959
Could that have been a temptation to get his kingdom started without the pain of being

00:05:48.959 --> 00:05:50.839
tortured to death?

00:05:50.839 --> 00:05:56.560
Well, knowing that the people were coming for him, Jesus with a drill.

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:59.160
Do we face similar temptations today?

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:04.720
Well, we willingly make sacrifices and have made sacrifices to serve Jehovah.

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:10.720
But we may see what others do and what others have and wonder, are our sacrifices really

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:11.720
worth it?

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.519
Is there any way I can have it now?

00:06:13.519 --> 00:06:16.720
Maybe if there's a way I can make some more money, I could do both and have the things

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:17.720
I want.

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:21.519
But you see three powerful temptations.

00:06:21.519 --> 00:06:25.480
Can you trust that your father will take care of you?

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:30.240
Are you sure Jehovah loves you and you have value?

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:33.720
Why wait when you can have it now?

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:40.279
So again, the question, what are your convenient times?

00:06:40.279 --> 00:06:41.279
What am I?

00:06:41.279 --> 00:06:42.279
Convenient times.

00:06:42.279 --> 00:06:45.920
Satan is going to find convenient times to tempt us.

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:46.920
That's a given.

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:51.040
A second Peter chapter, excuse me, first Peter chapter 2 and verse 8 says he's out there

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:53.800
like a roaring lion seeking to devour us.

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:59.600
If he found convenient times to tempt Jesus, we can be sure that he will do the same for

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:00.600
us.

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:02.040
What do we need to do?

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:04.759
Our job is to resist his temptations.

00:07:04.759 --> 00:07:06.319
How do we do that?

00:07:06.319 --> 00:07:08.480
The same way that Jesus did.

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.600
Did you know the two things he did?

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:16.480
And number one, Jesus recognized when he was being tempted.

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:20.519
And two, at that moment, he focused on Jehovah.

00:07:20.519 --> 00:07:26.240
It's interesting and everyone in his responses to Satan, he used Jehovah's name.

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:31.600
See, Jehovah's name is a powerful protection against Satan's attacks.

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:37.480
That's why Jesus listed praying to Jehovah to resist temptation, resist the wicked one

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:41.600
as a fundamental part when he was teaching his disciples how to pray.

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:46.800
That's why Jesus said that he made Jehovah's name known to his followers.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:52.959
That's why Proverbs 1810 tells us that Jehovah's name is a strong tower that we can run to

00:07:52.959 --> 00:07:54.920
for protection.

00:07:54.920 --> 00:08:00.879
See, speaking with Jehovah, using his name, meditating on his name and everything that

00:08:00.879 --> 00:08:08.240
it means can help us when we are being tempted by Satan when he finds convenient times to

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:09.839
attack us.

00:08:09.839 --> 00:08:11.839
And if we do that, what will be the result?

00:08:11.839 --> 00:08:18.839
We'll notice the guarantee that we have in Psalm 44 and verse 5.

00:08:18.839 --> 00:08:26.839
Psalm 44, verse 5, it says, by your power, we will drive back our adversaries.

00:08:26.839 --> 00:08:33.639
In your name, we will trample down those who rise up against us.

00:08:33.639 --> 00:08:41.440
Yes, all of us are going to find times that Satan finds convenient to tempt us.

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:47.559
When that happens, may we be sensitive to recognize that it is a temptation.

00:08:47.559 --> 00:08:53.720
And then look to Jehovah and focus on his name and if we do, we can have the confidence.

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:59.639
But as this Psalm says, this will help, Jehovah's name will help us to drive back and trample

00:08:59.639 --> 00:09:04.480
those who rise against us individually and as an organization.
