00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:07.419
I think all of us have had very interesting experiences with young ones, and we could

00:00:07.419 --> 00:00:10.779
go on quite a while speaking about them.

00:00:10.779 --> 00:00:21.059
But there is a story about a child psychologist who began his practice with four theories

00:00:21.059 --> 00:00:24.100
and no children.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:31.250
Some years later, he found that he had four children and no theories.

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:37.409
He learned that there was quite a bit to do, it was a lot to do, to raise a child.

00:00:37.409 --> 00:00:40.729
It was far more than just a few theories.

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:45.689
And this was a comment that was reported by psychologist Bruce Neromore and published

00:00:45.689 --> 00:00:50.409
in the awake of April the 8th, 1981.

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:54.130
So theories about child raising come and go.

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:58.609
And the best counsel on raising a child, of course, is found in the Bible.

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:04.849
We know that because it's been there for thousands of years and it's consistent, it's

00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:07.650
consistently successful.

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.769
There's another interesting point that there is four times as much counsel given to children

00:01:13.769 --> 00:01:17.890
in the book of Proverbs as given to adults.

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:23.450
That might surprise you, but that's what I read, so I believe it.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:31.170
Verse 226 is a familiar scripture for all of us, Proverbs 226.

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.329
And here it says, train a boy in the way he should go.

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:42.230
Even when he grows old, he will not depart from it.

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:43.549
Is that true?

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:45.349
Yes, it's true.

00:01:45.349 --> 00:01:50.790
It doesn't mean that in every case, a boy that's well trained by his parents won't depart

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:51.790
from it.

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.109
No, does not mean that.

00:01:54.109 --> 00:02:00.310
It's giving a general overall view of what will take place if a child is trained properly

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.670
by his parents.

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.790
And what it is, this is an interesting brief statement, excuse me, from the watchtower

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.629
of 2008 April 1st.

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:17.150
If a child is trained according to the Bible's counsel, the parent or parents are creating

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:23.469
the most favorable circumstances to bring about a marvelous result.

00:02:23.469 --> 00:02:28.870
That marvelous result is a faithful servant of Jehovah God.

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:37.349
And we can turn to Proverbs 23-24, where reference is made to that, Proverbs 23-24, and how many

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:42.949
parents are so delighted with their children, especially in the case of so many who are

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:45.030
serving at Bethel.

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:52.710
There at Proverbs 23-24, it says, the Father of a righteous one will surely be joyful.

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:56.789
The Father's a wise son will rejoice in him, and it does.

00:02:56.789 --> 00:03:00.550
It brings great pleasure to parents when that happens.

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.349
But there's another side to the coin.

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:11.340
Despite the most earnest efforts of parents, some children do become unfaithful.

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.340
Think about Solomon.

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:18.539
He wasn't a child, but it actually, it's very difficult to understand how that man turned

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:22.139
away from Jehovah in his old age, but he did.

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:25.620
And then even Jehovah had sons who proved unfaithful.

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.180
That's what the June 1st, 2007 watchtower, showed clearly and were all familiar with it,

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.860
the angels who turned away from their father, their creator, and it's something to keep

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:42.900
in mind for parents, particularly, who have really tried hard to raise their children properly.

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.860
We don't want to see them beat themselves, figuratively speaking, on and on for years

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.139
in years because they feel like they're failures.

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:52.580
They should not do that.

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:57.740
How do you account if it seems to some parents that know somehow they fail, but then how

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:02.860
do you account for children who receive no help whatsoever from their parents?

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.659
And they loved Jehovah and they come into the truth.

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:09.900
It's heart, heart condition.

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:15.740
So parents would be wise to focus on the future and what they can do, not to look back and

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:19.779
beat themselves over problems of the past.

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:26.620
And even when children do turn aside from serving Jehovah, parents who have conscientiously

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:32.060
trained their children in the way to walk, they can still entertain the hope that those

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.939
young ones will come back someday.

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:37.819
We never give up on our kids.

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:43.019
We don't give up on our close friends or siblings who may have walked away from the truth.

00:04:43.019 --> 00:04:46.459
We always hope that they'll come back.

00:04:46.459 --> 00:04:49.980
Psalm 19.7 is interesting.

00:04:49.980 --> 00:05:00.579
Psalm 19.7, speaking of the reminders of Jehovah, if there it reads, the law of Jehovah

00:05:00.579 --> 00:05:03.420
is perfect, restoring strength.

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:09.699
And then it says, the reminder of Jehovah is trustworthy, making the inexperienced one

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:11.300
wise.

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.139
Are those who leave the truth?

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:19.019
Many times it's reminders that come back to them the way it was at home, the counsel

00:05:19.019 --> 00:05:25.259
they receive from their parents, the loving congregation that they attended.

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:30.819
And who comes to mind when you think about the reminders coming to mind after living

00:05:30.819 --> 00:05:34.980
a life of debauchery, the prodigal son?

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:37.139
He was at His lowest.

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:39.019
And then who did He remember?

00:05:39.019 --> 00:05:44.339
His father, his father who undoubtedly had shown kindness and love to him.

00:05:44.339 --> 00:05:50.100
So we don't want to overlook the power there is in parental training.

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:55.139
Even though they may not respond, children may not respond immediately.

00:05:55.139 --> 00:05:56.980
They do many times later on.

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:04.339
And they go through experiences in life sometimes that wakes them up to the facts of life and reality.

00:06:04.339 --> 00:06:09.160
The truth is there are thousands upon thousands of children of Jehovah's Witnesses who are

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.579
being raised in the truth and whose way is pure and right.

00:06:12.579 --> 00:06:16.379
It really is thrilling to see young ones who they're able to think.

00:06:16.379 --> 00:06:20.939
They don't just parrot what their parents tell them, they're not just memorizing things.

00:06:20.939 --> 00:06:24.500
They've learned to have thinking ability and they can speak about the truth.

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:28.860
They defend the truth in a very interesting way.

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:34.220
In Britain, Tim and Sam, both 11 years old and unbaptized publishers were engaging

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:37.459
in field service with Tim's mother.

00:06:37.459 --> 00:06:44.339
The boys needed new bags to carry their Bibles in literature, but money was a problem.

00:06:44.339 --> 00:06:48.660
Earlier, before starting in the field service that day, the mothers of the two publishers

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:51.860
made this a subject of prayer.

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:56.660
At the last house to be visited that morning, Tim spoke to the householder and read a Bible

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:58.860
verse to her.

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:02.819
She interrupted him to ask what his religion was.

00:07:02.819 --> 00:07:08.259
When Tim replied that he was one of Jehovah's Witnesses, the woman scolded him and said

00:07:08.259 --> 00:07:12.420
to his mother that she could not understand why Jehovah's Witnesses let their children

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:16.100
die rather than allow them to accept blood transfusions.

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:20.819
That would be a difficult thing to have thrown in your face, a young man there at the

00:07:20.819 --> 00:07:23.100
door with his mother.

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:29.779
Tim's mother suggested that the woman asked the boys how they felt about this.

00:07:29.779 --> 00:07:31.279
She did.

00:07:31.279 --> 00:07:37.480
Tim explained that he would always choose alternative treatment rather than go against his Bible-trained

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:38.480
conscience.

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:42.600
This was from this young boy himself.

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:48.360
Sam then said, the other young boy, that his own sister had received alternative treatment

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:54.529
and had fared better than patients who had received blood.

00:07:54.529 --> 00:07:59.930
Then the householder again turned to Tim's mother, and this time she expressed disapproval

00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:03.129
of taking young children from door to door.

00:08:03.129 --> 00:08:05.930
I've heard that many times, I'm sure.

00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:11.089
Both of the boys responded to the woman on this occasion that they enjoyed preaching,

00:08:11.089 --> 00:08:15.730
adding that they preferred this to roaming the streets like others of their age.

00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:19.250
Well, this slowed the householder down a bit.

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:21.329
She was impressed by their reply.

00:08:21.329 --> 00:08:25.930
The householder asked the boys to wait a moment while she went into her house.

00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:31.490
What a surprise they had when she returned and presented each of them with a smart new

00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:35.570
leather bag ideal for their ministry.

00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:38.049
She sold these items for a living.

00:08:38.049 --> 00:08:43.090
Her changed attitude also allowed the boys to arrange for a return visit.

00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:49.049
And as they were leaving, the householder's 94-year-old mother who had been listening came

00:08:49.049 --> 00:08:55.129
to the door and asked Tim's mother to visit her at her home.

00:08:55.129 --> 00:08:57.409
Truly we are proud of our young ones.

00:08:57.409 --> 00:09:03.850
And it's a delight when you hear them make comments at the meetings in their own words.

00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:09.289
And you out in the field ministry with them and you see them make expressions of faith.

00:09:09.289 --> 00:09:16.610
We have thousands of good children who really are showing that their mature and they love

00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:17.610
Jehovah God.
