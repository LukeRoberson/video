00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:09.199
What a privilege we have to be associated with Jehovah's forward moving child-like organization.

00:00:09.199 --> 00:00:16.199
But when any vehicle is on the move, we expect the landscape to be constantly changing.

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:27.199
And because the chariot is on the move, our personal landscape may change a number of times from place to place or assignments to assignments.

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:31.199
So in line with our comments this morning, we want to deal with this question.

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.200
What can help us to embrace changes and actually enjoy them?

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:42.200
Are we going to answer that question by looking at the life of one outstanding early Christian

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.200
who experienced a number of unexpected assignments?

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:52.200
If you'd like to turn your Bible to the book of Acts, we're introduced to him in Acts chapter 6.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:01:02.200
He was one of seven men who were appointed to an administrative position to resolve a serious dispute that threatened to cause division.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.200
His name was Philip.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:16.200
Now all seven, including Philip, were selected because according to verse 3, they were well reported on and full of spirit and wisdom.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:26.200
Now these men took charge of the situation and because they were full of spirit and wisdom, they were able to resolve the problem peacefully.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:34.200
Now, is it possible that Philip and perhaps the other six wondered whether this assignment was going to be a Pamela thing?

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:44.200
Especially as administration looked as though it was necessary with the large increase up to 5,000 disciples had already joined at that point.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:51.200
Well, whatever they might have been thinking, their situation took a sudden turn in a different direction.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.200
If you look at Acts chapter 8 and verse 1, we'll see what happened.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:03.200
Acts 8 verse 1 says, on that day, great persecution arose against the congregation that was in Jerusalem.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:11.199
All except the apostles were scattered throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria.

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:18.199
So for Philip, suddenly all his certainties in life changed as he fled from Jerusalem.

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:25.199
From an able administrator, he became known as Philip the evangelizer.

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:40.199
Now, while we may think in terms of evangelizing being an enthusiastic preacher, often that term is used in the scriptures to describe someone who goes to work on a sign territory or unworked areas.

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:46.199
While other scattered Christians witnessed to the Jews, we find Philip went in a different direction.

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:50.199
We look at verse 5 and we can see this displayed on our map.

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:56.199
Now, Philip went down to the city of Samaria and began to preach the Christ to them.

00:02:56.199 --> 00:03:02.199
Here he was in a Jewish community going from Jerusalem to Samaria to preach.

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:07.199
He was obviously a skilled teacher because verse 6 relates.

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:16.199
The crowds with one accord were paying attention to what Philip said, and he had outstanding results we can see in verse 12.

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:27.199
But when they believe Philip, who was declaring the good news of the kingdom of God and of the name of Jesus Christ, both men and women were getting baptized.

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:33.199
Now, this is quite remarkable considering that Jews generally showed disrespect to the Samaritans.

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:41.199
It must have been so refreshing to the Samaritans to see that Philip ignored these social distinctions.

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:46.199
Surely, Philip must have made some very close friends there in Samaria.

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:55.199
And maybe at that point, he thought to himself, this is a nice place to be. This is where I'd like to settle and bring up my family.

00:03:55.199 --> 00:04:02.199
But that's not what Jehovah had in mind. His next assignment is described in verse 26.

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:12.199
However, Jehovah's angels spoke to Philip saying, get up and go to the south to the road that runs down from Jerusalem to Gaza.

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:16.199
This is a desert road.

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:24.199
Now, did Philip say, I like Samaria. I'd like to settle here. Perhaps I could have a day or two just to think this over.

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:33.199
Well, not as Philip's reaction in verse 27, it was immediate. It simply said with that, he got up and went.

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:42.199
Where to? Well, the landscape changed from a cool mountain region with magnificent views to a journey along a desert road.

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:51.199
While we cannot be specific as to the exact road he took, we can see from the map that it was quite a journey from Samaria to Gaza.

00:04:52.199 --> 00:05:01.199
And keep in mind that Philip was given no explanation as to why he was being reassigned, but he was about to find out.

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:08.199
Somewhere along the road, he encountered an Ethiopian who was headed home after worshiping in Jerusalem.

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:15.199
And the purpose for Philip's move became crystal clear, as we see in verse 29.

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:22.199
So the Spirit said to Philip, go over and approach this chariot.

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:27.199
Now, again, we see Philip's teaching skills coming to the fore.

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:35.199
As he approached the chariot, spoke to the Ethiopian, explained to him certain verses from Isaiah chapter 53.

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:42.199
Such was his clear explanation. The Ethiopian was baptized in a short time.

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:52.199
Now, incidentally, according to the study note, the Greek name for Ethiopia means region of burnt faces.

00:05:52.199 --> 00:06:02.199
This experience revealed another aspect of Philip's godly wisdom. He showed no racial partiality when preaching the good news.

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:08.199
Now, after baptizing the Ethiopian, there was no time for Philip to linger.

00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:11.199
Next assignment, verse 39.

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:22.199
When they came up out of the water, Jehovah's Spirit quickly led Philip away, and the unit did not see him anymore.

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:27.199
So he led him away, but took where? Verse 40 tells us.

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:32.199
Philip, however, found himself in Ashtod.

00:06:32.199 --> 00:06:38.199
Now, when you read that verse, it says he found himself in Ashtod.

00:06:38.199 --> 00:06:47.199
The wording perhaps suggests that he didn't have a clear idea where he was headed, but instead allowed Holy Spirit to guide him.

00:06:47.199 --> 00:06:51.199
However, Ashtod was not his final destination.

00:06:51.199 --> 00:07:01.199
Verse 40 says, and he went through the territory, and kept on declaring the good news to all the cities until he got to Caesarea.

00:07:01.199 --> 00:07:14.199
So we see from the map. We don't know whether he actually reached Gaza or not, but we see from the map that he journeyed somewhere up the coast all the way to his final destination in Caesarea.

00:07:14.199 --> 00:07:16.199
Why Caesarea?

00:07:16.199 --> 00:07:28.199
It was a prosperous place to live. It was a seaport by the Mediterranean Sea, nice warm climate, very nice indeed. Good place to settle.

00:07:28.199 --> 00:07:35.199
But these weren't really the reasons why Philip chose to settle and bring up a family in Caesarea,

00:07:35.199 --> 00:07:41.199
likely he settled there because it was an important international crossroads.

00:07:41.199 --> 00:07:51.199
It allowed him to continue to have a productive ministry, and certainly there was a Gentile community based in Caesarea.

00:07:51.199 --> 00:07:59.199
Now the reason for that conclusion is because of what is stated in Acts chapter 21, then verse 8 and 9.

00:07:59.199 --> 00:08:07.199
This is what said about Philip 20 years later in 56 CE where he is settled in Caesarea.

00:08:07.199 --> 00:08:24.199
Acts 21 verse 8 says, the next day we, that's Paul and Luke, left and came to Caesarea, and we entered the house so Philip, the evangelizer, who was one of the seven men, and we stayed with him.

00:08:24.199 --> 00:08:43.200
So what a blessing Philip must have been in the local community as an elder and a family head with his four single daughters all active in the ministry when you consider his experience of preaching throughout the territory and that association from the early days with the governing body.

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:51.200
Now despite his family responsibilities, his reputation was Philip the evangelizer.

00:08:51.200 --> 00:09:00.200
And you notice almost in passing that the verse draws attention to the fact that he was one of the seven.

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:08.200
Drawing attention to his past experience and service in Jerusalem tells us something about Jehovah.

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:23.200
We may be asked to move from place to place and our personal landscape may change, but how reassuring to know that Jehovah keeps a record of our past activity as he did with Philip and that's why he had it recorded there.

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:31.200
So an answer to our question, what can help us to embrace personal changes and enjoy them?

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:47.200
Well, even though changes may come through the charity organization rather than directly through an angel or Holy Spirit as was the case with Philip, once we discern Jehovah's hand in our assignment, don't hesitate to get on with it.

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:52.200
And if that is our attitude, then that's how we maintain joy.
