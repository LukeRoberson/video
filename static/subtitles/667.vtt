00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:08.410
Britain cares for the work in England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland, but we also care for

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:15.169
Malta, Pakistan, the Arabian Gulf and the Falkman Islands.

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:21.530
In the year 1900, Britain was the first branch to be established outside the United States.

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:27.250
The original branch building and its subsequent replacements were in the centre of the city,

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:33.850
but in 1959, the Bethel family moved to a 17-acre site in the suburbs of London in Levy,

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.850
Mill Hill.

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.929
Now radiating around that original Bethel property, there are now an additional eight

00:00:40.929 --> 00:00:47.850
apartment blocks, 12 houses, three office blocks and four printary buildings across an

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.369
area of 10 miles.

00:00:50.369 --> 00:00:56.329
We have a fleet of 37-15 Cedar buses to ferry personnel to morning worship, to their

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:59.810
work and back home again in the evening.

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:04.849
It was therefore with great joy that the Bethel family received the news that the governing

00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:10.450
body had approved the building of a new Bethel on a new site.

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.650
The brief that the relocation team was given was to cast their net wide around Britain

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.450
to see what your hover would bless.

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.250
Over 300 sites were investigated over a period of two years, and then we were alerted

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.329
to something that seemed to indicate Jehovah's blessing.

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:34.209
Surprisingly, a local planning authority approached us and asked if we were interested

00:01:34.209 --> 00:01:37.370
in this property at Temple Farm.

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:39.730
This was near the city of Chumsford.

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:44.370
It was owned by a family that had turned the site into a wrecking yard where there were

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:48.129
1,500 wrecked vehicles.

00:01:48.129 --> 00:01:54.209
When a meeting was held with the city planning team and some of the local elected officials,

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:58.890
others came from WDC to help us with the presentation.

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.010
During the meeting, one of the elected officials interrupted the presentation and said,

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:09.849
stop, stop, you seem to be under the impression that you're here to convince me that you should

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:11.370
have this site.

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:18.139
While I'm actually here to convince you that you should have this site.

00:02:18.139 --> 00:02:21.379
So where is the project now?

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:26.740
The governing body very kindly have given us permission to continue construction once

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.259
we've reviewed the scope of the building.

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:33.139
So we hope to be underway very soon.

00:02:33.139 --> 00:02:39.340
In the field, the video Why Study the Bible is proving to be a wonderful tool.

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.340
David, an auxiliary pioneer in the north of England, decided to follow the suggestion

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.740
to use the video.

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.379
But he was nervous as he'd never used his tablet in the ministry before.

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:53.419
So he prayed to Jehovah for courage.

00:02:53.419 --> 00:02:59.020
On his first call that morning, after inviting the householder to watch the video, the man

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.060
asked him in.

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.539
They watched the video.

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:08.099
The man Alan told David, he said, just two hours ago I was praying to God for someone

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:10.740
to help me learn about him.

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:16.659
David said, your prayer has been answered and immediately started the Bible study.

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:21.979
Everyone made good progress, studying twice a week, attending all the meetings from the

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:28.939
start, giving up smoking, and he was baptized on the second of May this year.

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:36.300
Those engaged in the special metropolitan program have been encouraged to become Bible study-minded.

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:40.740
When Emma approached a man who was looking at the Bible teach books on the cart, she told

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.219
him that he was welcome to take the book.

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:47.539
The man said, can someone teach me the Bible?

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:50.580
And then he said, look, I'm only in the city for one day I'm visiting.

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.419
Can you teach me to study now?

00:03:53.419 --> 00:03:58.500
So she straight away went through the first chapter of the Bible teach book.

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.379
As she finished that, he then said, can we continue this conversation somewhere?

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:08.340
So Emma and her husband Philip arranged to meet him at a coffee shop where she answered

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.139
or they both answered many of his questions.

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:17.139
During the discussion, they told him that the name of the true God is Jehovah and immediately

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:19.819
he started to use that name.

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:25.459
They then brought out the video, why study the Bible in his own language, Malayalam.

00:04:25.459 --> 00:04:26.980
That really impressed him.

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:33.300
And then they arranged for his study to continue in his home city.

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:38.620
Publishers who are regularly involved in the public witnessing work soon become well-known

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.019
in their communities.

00:04:41.019 --> 00:04:46.620
People get to trust us and they feel less intimidated by our presence.

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:52.939
In North London, Luigi, an elderly Italian brother, really does very well in this public

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:58.139
witnessing work at the local underground station where he's a constant feature in the early

00:04:58.139 --> 00:04:59.699
morning.

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:04.740
He has many root calls who collect their magazines.

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:10.899
One day as a young lady who started to regularly take the magazines approached to get her copies

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:16.819
and said, Luigi said to her, hey, what's your name?

00:05:16.819 --> 00:05:19.740
She said, my name is Juliet.

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.939
Ha, what a coincidence.

00:05:21.939 --> 00:05:29.990
My name is Romeo.

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:33.949
She laughed and went away to catch the train.

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:36.629
The next day, Luigi was at the station.

00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:41.470
The lady in the flora shop came out with a beautiful bouquet of flowers and presented it

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:42.470
to Luigi.

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:43.790
Luigi, this is for you.

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:45.430
It's for me.

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:53.329
We looked at a little card on the bouquet and it said, to Romeo from Juliet.

00:05:53.329 --> 00:06:04.319
So dear brothers and sisters, please accept this report and the warm love and best wishes

00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:25.439
on the battle family and the Chelmsford construction family.
