WEBVTT

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:13.259
We extend a warm welcome to your students, to your relatives and friends that you have invited to be here with you today, and to all others welcome.

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.260
Now we are ready to sing a song together. If you are able to, please stand.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:02:38.770
We are going to sing song number 106, the title is Gaining Jehovah's Friendship, and it's based on Psalm 15.

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:50.770
There are many schools in the world, the public schools, private schools, trade schools, elementary schools, high schools, universities, colleges.

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:55.770
There is home schooling, there is online schools.

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:04.770
Into what category does Gilead school fall? Well, it's not a trade school, nor a school for higher worldly learning.

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:10.770
It is a school based on divine education, the highest form of learning.

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:20.770
The name Gilead is probably derived from Gali, meaning witness heap, according to Genesis 31, 47, and 48.

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:31.110
It generally refers in the Bible to the mountainous region east of the Jordan, and what about the term school?

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:38.110
Interestingly, the word comes from the Greek word school, which originally meant leisure.

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:45.110
It was for those who had the means and the leisure to go and learn something in a school.

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:50.110
It was for the upper strata of society, in Greece and other countries as well.

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:55.110
The working class or the poor people did not go to school back then.

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:06.889
But now, of course, in our time, in most countries, rich and poor can go to some sort of school.

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:19.889
Despite the fact that there's emphasis on schooling, there's 785 million illiterate adults in the world,

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:24.889
translating into one in five people on the planet.

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:30.889
And all the more education is emphasized.

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:38.889
That's why many young people go to universities and colleges, and many do this to become rich.

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:49.889
Back in 1988, the May 22 issue of awake on page 29 referred to a research that was done.

00:04:49.889 --> 00:05:02.889
And it says, I quote, a new high of 71% of the freshmen in universities said that their reason for attending college was to make more money.

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:15.889
The findings were compiled from questionnaires completed by over 200,000 freshmen at 390 institutions.

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:20.889
Why did you students accept the invitation to attend Gilead?

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:25.889
To make more money after that was certainly not.

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:31.889
Was the major reason for coming here that desire to become spiritually rich?

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:35.889
Well, that desire is not wrong.

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:46.889
But if you came here primarily to get something, even spiritually, out of school, why would that not have been quite the right motive?

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:51.889
Did you come here primarily to benefit from the fine education?

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:58.889
Remember, Christian love is unselfish. It does not first of all think, what can I get out of it?

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:05.889
Christian love asks, how can I benefit others? Especially how can I benefit Jehovah?

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:11.889
Jehovah himself and I say 111 talks about benefit to him.

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:20.889
The issue is not so much how Gilead benefits you, but how can you benefit Jehovah after having received Gilead training?

00:06:20.889 --> 00:06:27.889
So why did you come to Gilead? Would you agree that it is and should be love for Jehovah?

00:06:27.889 --> 00:06:32.889
Is it not so that Jehovah should always come first?

00:06:32.889 --> 00:06:37.889
After graduating from Gilead, will you leave as a rich person?

00:06:37.889 --> 00:06:42.889
Well, you said no, no in the sense of material riches.

00:06:42.889 --> 00:06:46.889
And yes, in the sense of spiritual riches.

00:06:46.889 --> 00:06:52.889
However, you were already rich spiritually before you ever came to Gilead.

00:06:52.889 --> 00:06:57.889
But Gilead has enriched you even more, wouldn't you agree?

00:06:57.889 --> 00:07:07.889
In Jesus' time, and even today, people thought that being materially rich was proof of having God's blessing.

00:07:07.889 --> 00:07:14.889
Yes, they thought that the rich ones were first to get saved, but really it was the opposite way around.

00:07:14.889 --> 00:07:20.889
Which people said Jesus would have a hard time getting into the kingdom.

00:07:20.889 --> 00:07:27.889
Why did people in Jesus' days think that the rich were favored with God or by God?

00:07:27.889 --> 00:07:32.889
They may have thought of Psalm 112, 2 and 3, where it says,

00:07:32.889 --> 00:07:42.889
the generation of the upright will be blessed, wealth and riches, material riches, are in his house.

00:07:42.889 --> 00:07:47.889
They may also have thought about Proverbs 10, 22, where it says,

00:07:47.889 --> 00:07:56.889
it is the blessing of Jehovah that makes one rich, and he adds no pain with it.

00:07:56.889 --> 00:08:01.889
Now did Solomon under inspiration speak of spiritual riches?

00:08:01.889 --> 00:08:04.889
Not exactly.

00:08:04.889 --> 00:08:11.889
He referred to the fact that in ancient times, sometimes Jehovah blessed some of his servants with material.

00:08:11.889 --> 00:08:22.889
Insight number one of the volume number one, page 340 explains Proverbs 10, 22 like this.

00:08:22.889 --> 00:08:30.889
Jehovah blesses those whom he approves by protecting, prospering, guiding, giving success,

00:08:30.889 --> 00:08:36.889
and supplying their needs, material needs, end of quote.

00:08:36.889 --> 00:08:51.889
The Watchtower study article of August 1, 2007 correctly showed that the application of Proverbs 10, 22 resulted in prosperity and wealth for the ancient Israelites if they served Jehovah.

00:08:51.889 --> 00:08:55.889
You can watch this on the monitors.

00:08:55.889 --> 00:09:01.889
The artwork at the beginning of this Watchtower article showed what,

00:09:01.889 --> 00:09:12.889
showed herds of sheep, vineyards, crops, etc., all of it being material blessings.

00:09:12.889 --> 00:09:20.889
Solomon used the words rich or riches in Proverbs, at least 22 times.

00:09:20.889 --> 00:09:28.200
It is interesting that in none of these other occurrences does he speak about spiritual riches.

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:34.200
Of course, the prosperity of the nation of Israel did not mean that every individual was wealthy,

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:38.200
or that those who had little were necessarily under divine disapproval.

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:43.200
Unforeseen occurrences might plunge individuals into poverty.

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:47.200
Death could leave behind orphans or widows.

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:50.200
So wealthy ones were to help the poor.

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:54.450
However, think of Solomon.

00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:57.450
He became immensely rich, materially.

00:09:57.450 --> 00:10:04.450
Why? Because of the blessing of Jehovah, not because of his own efforts or gifts from others.

00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:10.450
Think of Abraham. Genesis 13.2 says,

00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:17.450
and Abraham was very rich in livestock, silver, and gold.

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:23.450
Yes, the blessing of Jehovah made him rich, not his own efforts.

00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:32.450
The meaning of Proverbs 10.22 can be seen also in line with what Abraham said to the king of Sodom,

00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:36.450
whose goods he recovered in a battle.

00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:43.450
And we can read this in Genesis chapter 14, verses 22 and 23.

00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:46.450
But Abraham said to the king of Sodom,

00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:50.450
I raise my hand in an oath to Jehovah the most high God,

00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:57.450
make of heaven and earth, that I will not take anything that is yours from a threat to a sandal lace,

00:10:57.450 --> 00:11:04.450
so that you may not say, I made Abraham rich.

00:11:04.450 --> 00:11:08.450
Really, yes, the king of Sodom did not make Abraham rich.

00:11:08.450 --> 00:11:14.450
It was Jehovah who made Abraham rich materially.

00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:18.450
Or we can think of Job after his test.

00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:24.450
He was materially even richer than he was before.

00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:34.759
Jehovah arranged for that. He came to have about 14,000 sheep and 6,000 camels.

00:11:34.759 --> 00:11:41.759
Proverbs 10.22 also says that Jehovah adds no pain with his material blessings.

00:11:41.759 --> 00:11:47.759
How so? Watched our 2001, September 15, explained it,

00:11:47.759 --> 00:11:53.759
that when faithful ones in pre-Christian times were blessed by Jehovah with riches,

00:11:53.759 --> 00:11:57.759
they may still have some kind of pain.

00:11:57.759 --> 00:12:00.759
But it never was caused by Jehovah.

00:12:00.759 --> 00:12:05.759
Jehovah is the source of every good gift and every perfect present.

00:12:05.759 --> 00:12:10.759
James 1, 17, hence his blessings never cause pain.

00:12:10.759 --> 00:12:13.759
Now, how were things in the first century?

00:12:13.759 --> 00:12:21.759
In the Christian Greek scriptures, the word rich, in Greek Plutiso, sometimes refers to spiritual riches.

00:12:21.759 --> 00:12:27.759
Jesus said to those in Laodicea, according to Revelation 3, 17 and 18,

00:12:27.759 --> 00:12:36.759
I advise you to buy from me gold, refined by fire, so that you may become rich spiritually.

00:12:36.759 --> 00:12:42.759
To the congregation in Smirna, today's Ismere in Western Turkey,

00:12:42.759 --> 00:12:47.759
Jesus said, I know your tribulation and poverty, but you are rich.

00:12:47.759 --> 00:12:50.759
Revelation 2.9.

00:12:50.759 --> 00:12:55.759
There were also materially rich Christians who may have become circumstantially

00:12:55.759 --> 00:13:03.759
or due to certain abilities or by inheritance, rich, not because of a special blessing from Jehovah.

00:13:04.759 --> 00:13:06.759
Now, what about today?

00:13:06.759 --> 00:13:10.759
We trusted Jehovah also materially blesses his people.

00:13:10.759 --> 00:13:16.759
By motivating the hearts of our brothers to donate enough so we are able to build kingdom halls, assembly halls,

00:13:16.759 --> 00:13:23.759
branch offices, translation offices, and give away literature without charge.

00:13:23.759 --> 00:13:28.759
The small donations of our brothers go a long way.

00:13:28.759 --> 00:13:33.759
On the other hand, on an individual basis, some brothers are not blessed materially.

00:13:33.759 --> 00:13:40.759
In some countries, some brothers eat only one meal a day because they cannot afford a second or third meal.

00:13:40.759 --> 00:13:48.759
Like among ancient Israelites, being poor is not an indication that one does not have Jehovah's blessing.

00:13:48.759 --> 00:13:57.759
Most brothers in the world are of moderate material means, but Jehovah definitely blesses them spiritually.

00:13:57.759 --> 00:14:04.759
Jehovah's promise today is not to make anyone rich in a supernatural way,

00:14:04.759 --> 00:14:11.759
but he promises to provide enough materially so one has the bread or the food for the day.

00:14:11.759 --> 00:14:18.759
He moves the hearts of our brothers to help each other materially in times of need.

00:14:18.759 --> 00:14:26.759
Therefore, you students, when you go to your assignments, you do not need to worry about material things.

00:14:26.759 --> 00:14:31.759
Neither do you relatives that are here today need to worry about that.

00:14:31.759 --> 00:14:42.460
Jehovah will care for the everyday needs of the students and all of us for that matter.

00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:52.460
Now we will hear the next presentation by brother Joel Delinger, helper of the governing body, especially the service committee,

00:14:52.460 --> 00:15:11.980
and his subject is never leave the classroom.

00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:16.980
Jehovah's people enjoy an amazing privilege.

00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:23.980
Whether we're in Gilead or not, all of us are taught by the grand instructor.

00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:33.980
And Jehovah has never before is providing a divine education that reaches our hearts and improves our service to him.

00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:40.980
But what does this mean for you, the students of the 139th class of Gilead,

00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:44.980
who will soon graduate? It means this.

00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:53.360
Class is not dismissed. Well, what do I mean?

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:59.360
Well, though you will be leaving Gilead and taking up assignments and all parts of the earth,

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:09.360
we want you to be assured that your grand instructor Jehovah and his figurative classroom will be going with you.

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:22.360
To develop this point a little bit further, let's examine how Jesus Christ paid close attention to divine instruction over the course of his very long life.

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:34.360
To begin, let's go to the Bible to Proverbs chapter 8, where we find an inspired description of wisdom, wisdom personify.

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:39.360
Now, you may be thinking, what does this have to do with Jesus and his training by Jehovah?

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:46.360
Well, let's see. Please read with me Proverbs chapter 8 and verse 22.

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:56.360
Jehovah produced me as the beginning of his way, the earliest of his achievements of long ago.

00:16:56.360 --> 00:17:01.360
Now, focus your attention please on the opening statement, Jehovah produced me.

00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:11.359
Could this apply to the quality wisdom? No. Wisdom did not have a beginning.

00:17:11.359 --> 00:17:17.359
Jehovah is the source of wisdom and Jehovah has always existed.

00:17:17.359 --> 00:17:21.359
Well, then what does this verse 22 mean?

00:17:21.359 --> 00:17:26.359
Well, as we know, other parts of the Bible help us to understand this.

00:17:26.359 --> 00:17:31.359
Jesus was the first born of creation.

00:17:31.359 --> 00:17:35.359
He was produced by Jehovah as the beginning of his way.

00:17:35.359 --> 00:17:39.359
Jesus is the earliest of Jehovah's achievements.

00:17:39.359 --> 00:17:47.359
That also means that Jesus was the first student in the classroom of Jehovah.

00:17:47.359 --> 00:17:53.359
Well, what kind of student did the first born son of God prove to be?

00:17:53.359 --> 00:17:56.359
Take your eyes please, Diverse 30.

00:17:56.359 --> 00:18:04.359
Here, wisdom personified, Jesus tells us, then I was beside him as a master worker.

00:18:04.359 --> 00:18:08.359
I was the one he was especially fond of, day by day.

00:18:08.359 --> 00:18:13.359
I rejoice before him all the time.

00:18:13.359 --> 00:18:20.359
What do we know? From the very beginning, from the start, Jesus graciously accepted training.

00:18:20.359 --> 00:18:24.359
He enjoyed being in Jehovah's classroom.

00:18:24.359 --> 00:18:30.359
And what was it that drew Jesus back to the classroom day by day?

00:18:30.359 --> 00:18:36.359
Was it a mere love of learning, intellectual stimulation?

00:18:36.359 --> 00:18:38.359
Verse 22 reveals more.

00:18:38.359 --> 00:18:42.359
It tells us that Jesus had a love of the Father.

00:18:42.359 --> 00:18:45.359
A love of the Grand Instructor.

00:18:45.359 --> 00:18:48.359
And that feeling was mutable.

00:18:48.359 --> 00:18:53.359
What a beautiful environment for study and learning.

00:18:53.359 --> 00:18:58.359
Well, this is a helpful reminder for all of us who are in Jehovah's figurative classroom.

00:18:58.359 --> 00:19:04.359
It reminds us that learning from Jehovah is a pleasure, never a chore.

00:19:04.359 --> 00:19:09.359
And it also means that as we learn and become diligent students,

00:19:09.359 --> 00:19:13.359
we draw ever closer to our loving Father.

00:19:13.359 --> 00:19:16.359
But look again at verse 30, please.

00:19:16.359 --> 00:19:21.359
Here we notice that Jesus is described as a master worker.

00:19:21.359 --> 00:19:26.359
Well, what work did he do at the beginning from early times?

00:19:26.359 --> 00:19:30.359
Colossians chapter 1 and verse 16 tells us that by means of him,

00:19:30.359 --> 00:19:34.359
all other things were created in the heavens and on the earth.

00:19:34.359 --> 00:19:38.359
Notice how the Watchtower magazine described it in a beautiful way.

00:19:38.359 --> 00:19:44.359
And I quote, in some respects, we might liken the cooperation between Father and Son

00:19:44.359 --> 00:19:50.359
to that of an architect working with a builder or a contractor who specializes

00:19:50.359 --> 00:19:55.359
in bringing the architect's ingenious designs to reality.

00:19:55.359 --> 00:19:58.359
That's a beautiful picture, isn't it?

00:19:58.359 --> 00:20:04.359
Think of that classroom setting, Jehovah and Jesus, Father and Son.

00:20:04.359 --> 00:20:09.359
Can we try to imagine the joy that the two of them experienced

00:20:09.359 --> 00:20:14.359
as they collaborated together and saw the fruitage of their labor?

00:20:14.359 --> 00:20:19.359
First, Jehovah created myriads of spirit creatures, angels,

00:20:19.359 --> 00:20:23.359
and then they began praising God alongside Jesus.

00:20:23.359 --> 00:20:28.359
And then think of the awe that Jesus, the master worker,

00:20:28.359 --> 00:20:31.359
the master contractor, the master builder, must have experienced

00:20:31.359 --> 00:20:36.359
as he saw Jehovah's design plans for the physical universe,

00:20:36.359 --> 00:20:40.359
for planet earth, for animal and plant life,

00:20:40.359 --> 00:20:46.359
and then for the first humans created in God's image.

00:20:46.359 --> 00:20:50.359
Well, what lesson do we learn from Jesus, the master worker?

00:20:50.359 --> 00:20:55.359
We learn that Jesus example demonstrates that to become better workers,

00:20:55.359 --> 00:21:02.359
to become a master worker, we first have to be master students.

00:21:02.359 --> 00:21:06.359
We first need to be disciples.

00:21:06.359 --> 00:21:12.359
Jesus, eagerness to learn from Jehovah enabled him to take on work assignments

00:21:12.359 --> 00:21:16.359
that contributed to the outworking of Jehovah's purpose.

00:21:16.359 --> 00:21:18.359
It's true for us today.

00:21:18.359 --> 00:21:22.359
Graduates of Gilead or not, all of us who are diligent students

00:21:23.359 --> 00:21:28.359
in Jehovah's classroom can become effective workers in the harvest

00:21:28.359 --> 00:21:31.359
and take on any other sacred service assignment

00:21:31.359 --> 00:21:34.359
that Jehovah may choose to give to us.

00:21:34.359 --> 00:21:37.359
Well, we've learned a lot from Proverbs.

00:21:37.359 --> 00:21:41.359
Let's take another example in Scripture that highlights how Jesus

00:21:41.359 --> 00:21:46.359
sets the superb example of one who never left the classroom.

00:21:46.359 --> 00:21:49.359
Please turn with me to Isaiah chapter 50

00:21:49.359 --> 00:21:55.359
and notice a messianic prophecy found in verses 4 and 5.

00:21:55.359 --> 00:22:00.359
That's Isaiah chapter 50 verses 4 and 5.

00:22:00.359 --> 00:22:06.359
Here again, we have a word picture that reveals Jesus' attentive interest

00:22:06.359 --> 00:22:09.359
in learning from the grand instructor.

00:22:09.359 --> 00:22:15.359
Now, as we read, imagine that Jesus is speaking in his pre-human existence.

00:22:16.359 --> 00:22:20.359
Notice what he says, Isaiah 50 verse 4.

00:22:20.359 --> 00:22:25.359
The sovereign Lord Jehovah has given me the tongue of those taught

00:22:25.359 --> 00:22:30.359
so that I may know how to answer the tired one with the right word.

00:22:30.359 --> 00:22:32.359
He awakens me morning by morning.

00:22:32.359 --> 00:22:36.359
He awakens my ear to listen like the taught ones.

00:22:36.359 --> 00:22:41.359
The sovereign Lord Jehovah has opened my ear and I was not rebellious.

00:22:41.359 --> 00:22:46.359
I did not turn in the opposite direction.

00:22:46.359 --> 00:22:49.359
Could you visualize the scene?

00:22:49.359 --> 00:22:53.359
A teacher who lovingly awakens his pupil morning by morning

00:22:53.359 --> 00:22:59.359
for what purpose to learn to be taught another lesson in the classroom.

00:22:59.359 --> 00:23:04.359
Prior to coming to earth, Jesus in that heavenly school

00:23:04.359 --> 00:23:10.359
was taught by Jehovah what to say, what to speak, how to teach

00:23:10.359 --> 00:23:13.359
to others when he would come to earth.

00:23:13.359 --> 00:23:17.359
The father also prepared his son to face difficult tests.

00:23:17.359 --> 00:23:22.359
And what do we know about Jesus when he was on earth

00:23:22.359 --> 00:23:25.359
in a new type of classroom?

00:23:25.359 --> 00:23:30.359
Jesus successfully passed every test of integrity.

00:23:30.359 --> 00:23:35.359
Why? He went into the test well prepared.

00:23:35.359 --> 00:23:38.359
Well, today it's true for us.

00:23:38.359 --> 00:23:43.359
Thanks to our grand creators personalized and specialized training

00:23:43.359 --> 00:23:47.359
at times, all of us can be prepared to face any challenge,

00:23:47.359 --> 00:23:50.359
any test that may arise in the future.

00:23:50.359 --> 00:23:53.359
Divine education inspires confidence.

00:23:53.359 --> 00:23:57.359
Not fear. Confidence that Jehovah will be with us.

00:23:57.359 --> 00:24:02.359
We can face the test and we can come out on the other side successfully.

00:24:02.359 --> 00:24:04.359
But what do we need to do?

00:24:04.359 --> 00:24:09.359
We need to keep our ears tuned, attentive to the instructor morning

00:24:09.359 --> 00:24:12.359
by morning, day after day.

00:24:12.359 --> 00:24:16.359
Well, we've looked at an example in Proverbs and in Isaiah.

00:24:16.359 --> 00:24:22.359
There are many other examples in Scripture that highlight how Jesus

00:24:22.359 --> 00:24:27.359
had an eagerness to learn and to apply what he learned.

00:24:27.359 --> 00:24:32.359
For example, while on earth, do we ever find in the Scriptures

00:24:32.359 --> 00:24:37.359
any evidence that Jesus had a condescending or superior attitude

00:24:37.359 --> 00:24:40.359
towards humans by no means?

00:24:40.359 --> 00:24:48.359
Jesus graciously accepted instruction from humans in perfect humans.

00:24:48.359 --> 00:24:53.359
At the age of 12, for example, when Jesus came up missing,

00:24:53.359 --> 00:24:56.359
where did his parents find him?

00:24:56.359 --> 00:25:01.359
Luke's account tells us that he was at the temple sitting in the midst of the

00:25:01.359 --> 00:25:05.359
teachers asking them questions.

00:25:05.359 --> 00:25:09.359
The Bible also reveals that Jesus learned not only from other humans,

00:25:09.359 --> 00:25:14.359
but also from his own experiences, his own sufferings and tests.

00:25:14.359 --> 00:25:20.359
Hebrews chapter 5 and verse 8 tells us that Jesus learned obedience

00:25:20.359 --> 00:25:23.359
from the things suffered.

00:25:23.359 --> 00:25:29.359
Does going through a test enduring a suffering produce a benefit?

00:25:29.359 --> 00:25:32.359
Is it a lesson that we should want to learn from?

00:25:32.359 --> 00:25:35.359
Jesus example says yes.

00:25:35.359 --> 00:25:40.359
Jesus didn't leave the classroom even when tested tremendously

00:25:40.359 --> 00:25:42.359
while going through a difficulty.

00:25:42.359 --> 00:25:48.359
Jesus came out of the test better, not bitter.

00:25:48.359 --> 00:25:50.359
Jesus was made perfect.

00:25:50.359 --> 00:25:54.359
In his role as a high priest, a merciful high priest,

00:25:54.359 --> 00:25:59.359
because he went through such tests here on earth.

00:25:59.359 --> 00:26:03.359
What an example Jesus serves for all of us

00:26:03.359 --> 00:26:07.359
who want to be in Jehovah's classroom today.

00:26:07.359 --> 00:26:13.359
Jesus now, after having acquired vast authority, vast experience,

00:26:13.359 --> 00:26:21.359
more seniority than anyone, has never left the classroom of Jehovah.

00:26:21.359 --> 00:26:23.359
But what can we?

00:26:23.359 --> 00:26:27.359
What can you, the students of the 139th class of Gilead,

00:26:27.359 --> 00:26:29.359
take away from this?

00:26:29.359 --> 00:26:32.359
As you leave Gilead, we want you to remember

00:26:32.359 --> 00:26:37.359
that the grants instructor and his classroom is going with you.

00:26:37.359 --> 00:26:41.359
Like Jesus, respond to the training, rejoice in your privilege

00:26:41.359 --> 00:26:45.359
to be a fellow worker with God, keep learning from others,

00:26:45.359 --> 00:26:50.359
learn from life's experiences, and keep adding to God's praise.

00:26:50.359 --> 00:26:56.359
Yes, we warmly encourage you to never, ever leave the classroom.

00:26:56.359 --> 00:27:12.259
Now, we have the privilege to listen to one of the members

00:27:12.259 --> 00:27:16.259
of the governing body, brother David's plane, and his subject is,

00:27:16.259 --> 00:27:20.259
be loyal like Baroque, not Barak.

00:27:20.259 --> 00:27:23.259
You know, don't mix up Barak with Baroque.

00:27:23.259 --> 00:27:25.259
Well, I guess we'll hear more about that.

00:27:25.259 --> 00:27:27.259
Thank you.

00:27:27.259 --> 00:27:30.259
I'm done.

00:27:31.259 --> 00:27:42.819
Well, some time ago, brother Tony Morris gave a very fine lecture

00:27:42.819 --> 00:27:44.819
to the Bethel family.

00:27:44.819 --> 00:27:51.819
And in that lecture, he encouraged us not to freeze people in time.

00:27:51.819 --> 00:27:53.819
Do you find yourself doing that at times

00:27:53.819 --> 00:27:57.819
where Bible characters are concerned?

00:27:57.819 --> 00:27:59.819
What about Baroque?

00:27:59.819 --> 00:28:03.819
What do you know about Baroque?

00:28:03.819 --> 00:28:06.819
Now, likely, you know that he was Jeremiah's secretary,

00:28:06.819 --> 00:28:10.819
and at one point, he got some counsel.

00:28:10.819 --> 00:28:12.819
That's a start.

00:28:12.819 --> 00:28:13.819
What else?

00:28:13.819 --> 00:28:19.140
If that's all you remember about, Baroque would be a very good thing

00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:21.140
for you to get better acquainted with the man.

00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:24.140
So let's turn to the Bible.

00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:29.140
Jeremiah, chapter 45.

00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:33.140
Now, we first run into Baroque in the fourth year of Jehovahiacan,

00:28:33.140 --> 00:28:35.140
who was the king of Judah.

00:28:35.140 --> 00:28:38.140
So it may be that Baroque was new to the job

00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:43.140
when we read what's recorded at Jeremiah 45, verse 2,

00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:44.140
to start with.

00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:47.140
Now, imagine the scene.

00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:51.140
Baroque is asked by Jeremiah to bring his writing materials

00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:55.140
and to sit down and take dictation.

00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:59.140
And Jeremiah begins to speak, verse 2.

00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:03.140
Jeremiah 45, beginning with verse 2.

00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:08.140
This is what Jehovah, the God of Israel, says.

00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:10.140
Have you got that, Baroque?

00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:12.140
Have you got that down?

00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:16.140
Concerning you, Baroque.

00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:19.140
Baroque puts down his stylus.

00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:21.140
He looks inquiringly at Jeremiah.

00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:24.140
Keep writing. Keep writing.

00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:26.140
You have said,

00:29:26.140 --> 00:29:30.140
Oh, to me, for Jehovah has added grief to my pain.

00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:32.140
I am weary from my groaning,

00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:35.140
and I have found no resting place.

00:29:35.140 --> 00:29:37.140
You should say to him,

00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:40.140
this is what Jehovah says.

00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:43.140
Look what I have built up.

00:29:43.140 --> 00:29:44.140
I am tearing down.

00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:48.140
And what I have planted, I am uprooting the entire land.

00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:53.140
But you are seeking great things for yourself.

00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:56.140
Stop seeking such things.

00:29:56.140 --> 00:30:00.140
For I am about to bring calamity on all flesh declares Jehovah.

00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:02.140
And wherever you may go,

00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:07.140
I will grant you your life as a spoil.

00:30:07.140 --> 00:30:11.140
Now suppose Baroque was new to the job

00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:15.140
when we first read this in Jeremiah 45.

00:30:15.140 --> 00:30:18.140
Have you always been proud of your initial reaction

00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:20.140
when you got a new assignment

00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:24.140
or when you got a change of assignment that you weren't expecting?

00:30:24.140 --> 00:30:27.140
If so, would you like that initial reaction

00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:31.140
to define you as a person forever?

00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:36.140
It's a matter of not freezing people in time.

00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:38.140
Now Baroque needed counsel,

00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:40.140
and he received counsel.

00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:43.140
But Jehovah didn't freeze Baroque in time.

00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:49.140
In fact, he extended further privileges to Baroque later on.

00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:54.140
Now Baroque took his counsel like a man.

00:30:54.140 --> 00:30:57.140
We might soak when we receive counsel,

00:30:57.140 --> 00:31:00.140
but there's no evidence that Baroque did.

00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:01.140
He could have said,

00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:03.140
look, I don't mind getting counsel, Jehovah,

00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:06.140
but do I have to write it down?

00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:08.140
Is someone going to read this?

00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:11.140
But there's no record that he ever did that.

00:31:11.140 --> 00:31:14.140
Now what was Baroque's problem?

00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:17.140
Well, number one, he's not focused.

00:31:17.140 --> 00:31:21.140
He is not happy with what he's doing now.

00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:23.140
I'm a member of the royal family.

00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:25.140
I have talent.

00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:26.140
I have potential.

00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:30.140
I'm not being used to my potential.

00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:34.140
Number two, he's not concerned about what Jehovah is doing.

00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:36.140
He's more concerned about himself

00:31:36.140 --> 00:31:39.140
and what he wants to do.

00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:44.140
I'm not being used to my potential.

00:31:44.140 --> 00:31:48.140
Has that thought ever crossed your mind?

00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:54.140
If it has, would you want that to define you as a person forever?

00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:56.140
So what's the lesson?

00:31:56.140 --> 00:32:00.140
Don't always be looking at what you would like to be doing.

00:32:00.140 --> 00:32:02.140
You'd like to be doing something else.

00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:05.140
Be happy in doing what you were doing now.

00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:08.140
Be happy with your assignment right now.

00:32:08.140 --> 00:32:12.140
Now, to find out what happens after the scroll is written,

00:32:12.140 --> 00:32:15.140
you have to turn to Jeremiah 36.

00:32:15.140 --> 00:32:19.140
Now remember, the book of Jeremiah is not in chronological order.

00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:24.140
So chapter 36 comes after chapter 45.

00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:27.140
I didn't write it.

00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:29.140
Jeremiah 36.

00:32:29.140 --> 00:32:36.140
And verses 46, it tells you what happened after Baroque wrote down the scroll.

00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:38.140
Verse 4, it says,

00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:41.140
Jeremiah then called Baroque, the son of Naraya,

00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:46.140
and Jeremiah dictated all the words that Jehovah had spoken to him,

00:32:46.140 --> 00:32:49.140
and Baroque wrote them in the scroll.

00:32:49.140 --> 00:32:51.140
So now you have a scroll.

00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:53.140
But look what happens next.

00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:55.140
Verse 5.

00:32:55.140 --> 00:32:57.140
Then Jeremiah commanded Baroque,

00:32:57.140 --> 00:33:01.140
I am confined and unable to enter the house of Jehovah.

00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:06.140
So you are the one who must go in and read aloud the words of Jehovah

00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:09.140
from the scroll that you wrote at my dictation.

00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:14.140
Read them in the hearing of the people at the house of Jehovah.

00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:18.140
So now Jeremiah has written all of these things,

00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:21.140
this very strong message,

00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:26.140
but he gets Baroque to deliver the message to the people.

00:33:26.140 --> 00:33:29.140
How does Baroque react?

00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:34.140
Does he for swear this opportunity?

00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:36.140
Do I want out of this? No.

00:33:36.140 --> 00:33:37.140
In verse 8, it says,

00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:39.140
So Baroque, the son of Naraya did,

00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:42.140
all that Jeremiah the prophet had commanded him.

00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:48.140
He read aloud from the scroll the words of Jehovah at the house of Jehovah.

00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:51.140
So first of all, he reads the scroll to the people.

00:33:51.140 --> 00:33:57.140
And then the princes decide that they would like to hear what's on the scroll.

00:33:57.140 --> 00:34:00.140
Now what do we know about the princes?

00:34:00.140 --> 00:34:06.140
Four years earlier, these same princes had tried to put Jeremiah to death.

00:34:06.140 --> 00:34:10.139
And now they're asking Baroque to read the scroll.

00:34:10.139 --> 00:34:13.139
Baroque could have said, look, I'm in the hot seat now.

00:34:13.139 --> 00:34:16.139
This is a terrible thing. The pay is terrible.

00:34:16.139 --> 00:34:18.139
The hours are terrible.

00:34:18.139 --> 00:34:21.139
I don't need this pressure, but he didn't.

00:34:21.139 --> 00:34:25.139
He courageously read the words to the princes.

00:34:25.139 --> 00:34:29.139
And when the princes heard these words, they decided that the king

00:34:29.139 --> 00:34:32.139
who had a terrible temper,

00:34:32.139 --> 00:34:35.139
that the king needed to hear these words as well.

00:34:35.139 --> 00:34:40.139
And wisely, they suggested to Jeremiah and to Baroque that they had better hide.

00:34:40.139 --> 00:34:43.139
And that turned out to be good advice.

00:34:43.139 --> 00:34:45.139
So now picture this.

00:34:45.139 --> 00:34:49.139
Jeremiah is the prophet, but who's getting in trouble?

00:34:49.139 --> 00:34:51.139
Baroque.

00:34:51.139 --> 00:34:56.139
In fact, later, the princes thought that Baroque was the ringleader

00:34:56.139 --> 00:35:01.139
and that Jeremiah was just a puppet of Baroque's.

00:35:01.139 --> 00:35:06.139
So he was beginning to take more and more responsibility for things.

00:35:06.139 --> 00:35:11.139
Well, sure enough, when the king heard what was on the scroll, he got very angry.

00:35:11.139 --> 00:35:17.139
And he put out a warrant for the arrest of Jeremiah and Baroque.

00:35:17.139 --> 00:35:21.139
Probably it was that part about his burial being the burial of a donkey

00:35:21.139 --> 00:35:23.139
that the king didn't like.

00:35:24.139 --> 00:35:29.139
He didn't like it and a warrant is put out for their arrest.

00:35:29.139 --> 00:35:34.139
Now did Baroque have reason to believe that he'd be killed?

00:35:34.139 --> 00:35:40.139
Now if he was listening when he heard the counsel that Jeremiah had given him,

00:35:40.139 --> 00:35:42.139
what did you hope to say?

00:35:42.139 --> 00:35:46.139
You will have your life as a spoil.

00:35:46.139 --> 00:35:49.139
So whatever the princes did, whatever the king did to him,

00:35:49.139 --> 00:35:53.139
he would not be able to kill the man.

00:35:53.139 --> 00:35:58.139
Now what happened to that project that Baroque had worked so hard on?

00:35:58.139 --> 00:36:01.139
Well, it was red to the king.

00:36:01.139 --> 00:36:03.139
The scroll was red to the king.

00:36:03.139 --> 00:36:08.139
And as each role was done, the king cut it up and he put it into the fire.

00:36:08.139 --> 00:36:11.139
And all that work was for nothing.

00:36:11.139 --> 00:36:14.139
Have you ever worked on a project that was scrapped?

00:36:14.139 --> 00:36:17.139
If so, you know the feeling.

00:36:18.139 --> 00:36:20.139
But then Jehovah calls Jeremiah and he says,

00:36:20.139 --> 00:36:22.139
now I want you to take another scroll,

00:36:22.139 --> 00:36:27.139
and I want you to write all the words on that scroll that were on the first scroll.

00:36:27.139 --> 00:36:30.139
But who's going to do the work?

00:36:30.139 --> 00:36:33.139
Oh, Baroque!

00:36:33.139 --> 00:36:37.139
Would you come here, please, and bring your writing materials.

00:36:37.139 --> 00:36:42.139
Baroque had no idea if that scroll was going to be burned up as well.

00:36:42.139 --> 00:36:45.139
But that scroll turned out to be very valuable.

00:36:46.139 --> 00:36:50.139
And Baroque had no idea how much value that scroll was going to have

00:36:50.139 --> 00:36:57.139
Jesus, the Apostle Paul, and many others quoted from the book of Jeremiah.

00:36:57.139 --> 00:37:00.139
And Baroque was able to contribute to that.

00:37:00.139 --> 00:37:08.139
We have no idea sometimes how much value a project that we are working on is going to have.

00:37:08.139 --> 00:37:12.139
Well, how long did Baroque remain in his assignment?

00:37:12.139 --> 00:37:15.139
The Bible tells us that 18 years later,

00:37:15.139 --> 00:37:19.139
he is still loyally at Jeremiah's side.

00:37:19.139 --> 00:37:23.139
What's the lesson for you, dear brothers and sisters?

00:37:23.139 --> 00:37:31.139
Are you going to be found loyally at your post, no matter what challenge you face in your new assignment?

00:37:31.139 --> 00:37:36.539
One day, Baroque is going to be resurrected,

00:37:36.539 --> 00:37:39.539
and you're going to get a chance to meet him.

00:37:39.539 --> 00:37:42.539
You'll say, I know all about you.

00:37:42.539 --> 00:37:48.539
Baroque will roll his eyes and say, I know, I know you're looking for great things for yourself.

00:37:48.539 --> 00:37:52.539
I've heard it a thousand times since I was resurrected.

00:37:52.539 --> 00:37:56.539
But then you'll say, no, that's not what I mean.

00:37:56.539 --> 00:37:59.539
You were courageous. You were humble.

00:37:59.539 --> 00:38:01.539
You were faithful and loyal.

00:38:01.539 --> 00:38:04.539
You were loyal both to Jehovah and to Jeremiah.

00:38:04.539 --> 00:38:06.539
I was inspired by your account.

00:38:06.539 --> 00:38:09.539
And I wanted to be just like you.

00:38:09.539 --> 00:38:31.650
Next we hear from brother James Coffin, who starts with the school department, theocratic schools department.

00:38:31.650 --> 00:38:34.650
And his subject is, apply the rule.

00:38:34.650 --> 00:38:45.309
In less than 20 words, Jesus, the master teacher,

00:38:45.309 --> 00:38:50.309
condensed much of the Hebrew scriptures into one single principle.

00:38:50.309 --> 00:38:58.309
And in doing so, he gave a moral compass to humankind for all time.

00:38:58.309 --> 00:39:03.309
Let's remind ourselves of those words as they're found in the sermon on the Mount.

00:39:03.309 --> 00:39:08.780
Turn with me, please, to Luke chapter 6.

00:39:08.780 --> 00:39:12.780
We're going to read verse 31, and you can leave your bibles open here, if you would.

00:39:12.780 --> 00:39:14.780
Luke 631.

00:39:14.780 --> 00:39:22.699
Also, just as you want men to do to you, do the same way to them.

00:39:22.699 --> 00:39:28.699
Now these words, I'm sure you recognize, are often referred to as the golden rule.

00:39:28.699 --> 00:39:39.699
And this rule has been verbalized, quoted, and recorded with some variations in virtually all languages and all cultures around the earth.

00:39:39.699 --> 00:39:49.699
Every day and in a variety of ways, all of us are tested as to how we will apply the rule in our lives.

00:39:49.699 --> 00:39:57.699
Perhaps the most difficult of those tests are in association with the application of Jesus words found in verse 37.

00:39:58.699 --> 00:40:01.699
Let's read just a latter part of that.

00:40:01.699 --> 00:40:04.699
Luke 637.

00:40:04.699 --> 00:40:10.699
It says, keep on forgiving, and you will be forgiven.

00:40:10.699 --> 00:40:13.699
Keep on forgiving.

00:40:13.699 --> 00:40:16.699
So how do these words apply to you?

00:40:16.699 --> 00:40:22.699
The soon to be graduates of the 139th Class of Gilea.

00:40:23.699 --> 00:40:30.699
The question is, how willing and how eager will you be to keep on forgiving?

00:40:30.699 --> 00:40:39.699
When you leave this place, brothers and sisters, you're going to continue to be surrounded by imperfect people.

00:40:39.699 --> 00:40:45.699
You're surrounded by imperfect people trying to do the perfect will of God.

00:40:45.699 --> 00:40:52.699
And they're going to be trying to do it under some of the most difficult circumstances in human history.

00:40:52.699 --> 00:40:58.699
I don't know if you've noticed or not, but imperfect people tend to make mistakes.

00:40:58.699 --> 00:41:04.619
It's hard to imagine, but it is true.

00:41:04.619 --> 00:41:11.619
Imperfect people say the wrong thing, they make poor decisions, they act thoughtlessly.

00:41:11.619 --> 00:41:20.619
And then added to this fact is that when imperfect people work together, worship together, preach together, live together, play together.

00:41:20.619 --> 00:41:28.619
Sooner or later, there's going to be something happen that is a cause for offense.

00:41:28.619 --> 00:41:34.619
Now, if it hasn't happened to you, just wait.

00:41:34.619 --> 00:41:37.619
Because it will come, that's guaranteed.

00:41:37.619 --> 00:41:43.619
And when it comes, don't be too surprised and don't be too quick to rush to judgment.

00:41:43.619 --> 00:41:52.619
Because the truth of the matter is that the day you become offended may also be the same day that you have offended another yourself.

00:41:52.619 --> 00:42:00.619
And at the very least, you can be assured that we have offended Jehovah probably numerous times that day already.

00:42:00.619 --> 00:42:08.619
And that's why in virtually every prayer, we ask Jehovah to please forgive us for our sins.

00:42:08.619 --> 00:42:16.619
So the question, how willing will you be to forgive others, to apply the rule in your life?

00:42:16.619 --> 00:42:19.619
And why is it so important to do so?

00:42:19.619 --> 00:42:23.619
Let's look at verse 27, well we're here.

00:42:24.619 --> 00:42:31.619
Jesus said, but I say to you who are listening, continue to love your enemies.

00:42:31.619 --> 00:42:34.619
Did you notice that? Continue.

00:42:34.619 --> 00:42:42.619
You see, it's a Christian requirement actually to forgive others even though they may offend us repeatedly.

00:42:42.619 --> 00:42:46.619
Now, I can see it on your face.

00:42:46.619 --> 00:42:52.619
You're sitting there and you're thinking, well, that sounds really good in theory.

00:42:52.619 --> 00:42:55.619
But it's easier said than done.

00:42:55.619 --> 00:42:58.619
And in fact, it is easier said than done.

00:42:58.619 --> 00:43:02.619
And you know why? Because our emotions become involved.

00:43:02.619 --> 00:43:08.619
And when emotion becomes involved, it always clouds clear thinking.

00:43:08.619 --> 00:43:19.619
So how are we to freely forgive, to put these things behind us, to imitate Jehovah as he wants us to do that?

00:43:19.619 --> 00:43:24.619
Well, the answer is basic. Apply the rule.

00:43:24.619 --> 00:43:28.619
Now, here's five suggestions that can help us, okay?

00:43:28.619 --> 00:43:33.619
Number one, look at the principle in verse 36.

00:43:33.619 --> 00:43:38.619
Verse 36, it says, continue being merciful just as your father is merciful.

00:43:38.619 --> 00:43:46.619
Now, we know that if we try to walk in the footsteps of Jesus and imitate Jehovah, that he'll help us.

00:43:46.619 --> 00:43:52.619
So step number one, we need to continue to ask Jehovah to help us to imitate him.

00:43:52.619 --> 00:43:59.619
And then you know what you have to do. You have to exercise your will.

00:43:59.619 --> 00:44:03.619
We know that Jehovah blesses us when we put forth effort.

00:44:03.619 --> 00:44:06.619
We pray to him, we put forth effort, we get the blessing.

00:44:06.619 --> 00:44:11.619
Some would say, well, when it comes to forgiving, I just don't feel like it.

00:44:11.619 --> 00:44:18.619
Well, try to understand that forgiving another isn't about how you feel.

00:44:18.619 --> 00:44:20.619
It's an act of your will.

00:44:20.619 --> 00:44:28.619
So do what Jehovah says is right, and your heart will catch up later.

00:44:28.619 --> 00:44:32.619
Step number two, develop empathy.

00:44:32.619 --> 00:44:37.619
So our brothers are bruised like us, they're faulty like us or victims like us.

00:44:37.619 --> 00:44:40.619
They're imperfect like us.

00:44:40.619 --> 00:44:44.619
And we're so thankful that Jehovah has compassion on us.

00:44:44.619 --> 00:44:51.090
Of course, we understand that when you're wrong, when you have your feelings hurt,

00:44:51.090 --> 00:44:55.090
there's no right that seems more sacred than the right to get even.

00:44:55.090 --> 00:44:59.139
We want a balancing of the scales.

00:44:59.139 --> 00:45:02.139
We want justice. Someone has to pay.

00:45:02.139 --> 00:45:07.250
Someone has paid.

00:45:07.250 --> 00:45:09.250
And that someone is Jesus.

00:45:09.250 --> 00:45:17.010
When we develop the same tenderness that Jesus had toward others,

00:45:17.010 --> 00:45:23.010
then our compassionate heart can also become a forgiving heart.

00:45:23.010 --> 00:45:31.119
Point number three, remember that no matter what another person does or says,

00:45:32.460 --> 00:45:35.460
you still have to act like a Christian.

00:45:35.460 --> 00:45:41.460
No one else is responsible for how you act or react than yourself.

00:45:41.460 --> 00:45:45.460
And so, Jehovah, he's not unreasonable.

00:45:45.460 --> 00:45:52.449
He understands that emotional wounds take time to heal.

00:45:52.449 --> 00:46:00.449
But a failure to forgive eventually becomes a sin in itself.

00:46:00.449 --> 00:46:04.449
It will toward another person will not change their heart.

00:46:04.449 --> 00:46:08.449
It will, however, change yours.

00:46:08.449 --> 00:46:13.449
On the other hand, we could have the privilege of helping a brother, sister, do better.

00:46:13.449 --> 00:46:17.449
Be more attendee to the things they say or the way they act.

00:46:17.449 --> 00:46:20.449
Look at this principle in verse 38.

00:46:20.449 --> 00:46:23.449
It says, practice giving and people will give to you.

00:46:23.449 --> 00:46:26.449
The latter part says, for with the measure that you are measuring out,

00:46:26.449 --> 00:46:30.449
they will measure out to you in return.

00:46:30.449 --> 00:46:33.449
Now, Jesus wasn't just talking about material giving,

00:46:33.449 --> 00:46:38.449
but he was talking about deciding and putting forth an effort to live in a way that helps us

00:46:38.449 --> 00:46:45.050
grow spiritually and will help others to do the same.

00:46:45.050 --> 00:46:47.050
Point number four.

00:46:47.050 --> 00:46:51.050
And this has been emphasized throughout the Gilead course.

00:46:51.050 --> 00:46:55.050
Jehovah cares deeply about how humans interact with one another.

00:46:55.050 --> 00:46:58.050
He cares about how we treat one another.

00:46:58.050 --> 00:47:04.050
Jesus said by this, all will know that you are my disciples that you have love.

00:47:04.050 --> 00:47:07.050
And we consider our brotherhood something very precious.

00:47:07.050 --> 00:47:09.050
I know you would agree.

00:47:09.050 --> 00:47:12.050
But when we quit forgiving another,

00:47:12.050 --> 00:47:17.050
that precious relationship begins to end.

00:47:17.050 --> 00:47:19.050
Be determined.

00:47:19.050 --> 00:47:22.050
Allow no place for the devil.

00:47:22.050 --> 00:47:24.050
Apply the rule.

00:47:24.050 --> 00:47:26.050
Forgive the debt.

00:47:26.050 --> 00:47:28.050
Surrender your right to an apology.

00:47:28.050 --> 00:47:30.050
Surrender your right to get even.

00:47:30.050 --> 00:47:33.050
Surrender your right to hold a grudge.

00:47:33.050 --> 00:47:37.050
Value your relationship with your brothers and sisters,

00:47:37.050 --> 00:47:39.050
more than your ego.

00:47:39.050 --> 00:47:41.050
De-throwing yourself.

00:47:41.050 --> 00:47:44.969
One final point.

00:47:44.969 --> 00:47:50.969
Satan's rebellion has allowed Jehovah's perfect qualities to become more obvious than ever.

00:47:50.969 --> 00:47:53.969
And that includes his willingness to forgive.

00:47:53.969 --> 00:47:56.969
So we have a unique opportunity.

00:47:56.969 --> 00:47:59.969
We can imitate our God.

00:47:59.969 --> 00:48:01.969
Apply the rule.

00:48:01.969 --> 00:48:06.969
And you can experience the joy that Jehovah feels by freely forgiving others.

00:48:06.969 --> 00:48:08.969
Apply the rule.

00:48:08.969 --> 00:48:12.969
And you will enjoy the brotherhood and the brothers will enjoy you.

00:48:12.969 --> 00:48:14.969
Apply the rule.

00:48:14.969 --> 00:48:17.969
And you'll strengthen the organization by your interaction with others.

00:48:17.969 --> 00:48:19.969
Apply the rule.

00:48:19.969 --> 00:48:22.969
And you will enjoy the greatest blessing of all.

00:48:22.969 --> 00:48:44.050
The approval of your Heavenly Father, Jehovah.

00:48:44.050 --> 00:48:46.050
No brother, Mark, no mayor.

00:48:46.050 --> 00:48:47.050
Long time.

00:48:47.050 --> 00:48:48.050
Kill it instructor.

00:48:48.050 --> 00:48:50.050
We'll speak to us on the subject.

00:48:50.050 --> 00:48:52.050
Keep the miracle going.

00:48:52.050 --> 00:48:58.159
The baby boy was born in response to a prayer.

00:48:58.159 --> 00:49:07.159
That prayer touched Jehovah's heart so much that he inspired the boy when he became a man to record it.

00:49:07.159 --> 00:49:09.159
The boy was Samuel.

00:49:09.159 --> 00:49:12.159
The prayer was Hanna's.

00:49:12.159 --> 00:49:18.159
The normal circumstances, the sentiments of personal prayers, they're not heard by humans.

00:49:18.159 --> 00:49:23.159
But Jehovah considers the miracle of a personal prayer to be a private matter.

00:49:23.159 --> 00:49:30.159
However, Jehovah wanted the two prayers of Hanna to be recorded.

00:49:30.159 --> 00:49:33.159
How precious they must have been to him.

00:49:33.159 --> 00:49:41.159
And how eager, Samuel must have been to help us to know about his mother and especially her prayers.

00:49:41.159 --> 00:49:46.159
Particularly the one recorded at 1 Samuel chapter 2.

00:49:46.159 --> 00:49:50.159
That prayer was special to Samuel.

00:49:50.159 --> 00:49:52.159
Why?

00:49:52.159 --> 00:50:00.159
Because the words and feelings and thoughts of that prayer helped define who Samuel became.

00:50:00.159 --> 00:50:03.159
How many times did he hear about that prayer?

00:50:03.159 --> 00:50:09.159
Once a year when his mother brought him his sleeveless coat, we don't know.

00:50:09.159 --> 00:50:16.159
But what we do know is that Samuel kept the miracle of that prayer going.

00:50:16.159 --> 00:50:18.159
How?

00:50:18.159 --> 00:50:27.159
By allowing the sentiments and feelings contained in that prayer to shape and mold his life.

00:50:27.159 --> 00:50:29.159
Now it's your turn.

00:50:29.159 --> 00:50:37.159
Let's now examine how some 3,000 years later you can keep the miracle going.

00:50:37.159 --> 00:50:38.159
How?

00:50:38.159 --> 00:50:47.159
By allowing the feelings, the thoughts and the sentiments contained in that prayer to help you fulfill your assignments.

00:50:47.159 --> 00:50:49.159
Let's open our Bibles 2.

00:50:49.159 --> 00:50:51.159
1 Samuel chapter 2.

00:50:51.159 --> 00:51:05.159
And we'll begin again to see how you can keep the miracle of this prayer going as you fulfill your commission in your respective assignments.

00:51:05.159 --> 00:51:06.159
Chapter 2.

00:51:06.159 --> 00:51:09.159
We'll start at verse 3.

00:51:09.159 --> 00:51:11.159
We're going to take that last sentence.

00:51:11.159 --> 00:51:13.159
1 Samuel chapter 2, verse 3.

00:51:13.159 --> 00:51:16.159
And by him, this is what Hannah says.

00:51:16.159 --> 00:51:22.159
And by him, Jehovah, deeds are rightly evaluated.

00:51:22.159 --> 00:51:24.159
Hannah knew that.

00:51:24.159 --> 00:51:28.159
Hannah knew that deeds are rightly evaluated by Jehovah.

00:51:28.159 --> 00:51:34.159
She experienced that first hand when Eli went ahead and misjudged her.

00:51:34.159 --> 00:51:38.159
She began to accuse her of something that she was not doing.

00:51:38.159 --> 00:51:43.159
He jumped to the conclusion and said, you're drunk.

00:51:43.159 --> 00:51:47.159
Now, Hannah didn't argue with Eli.

00:51:47.159 --> 00:51:50.159
Nor did she say, what about your wicked sons?

00:51:50.159 --> 00:51:52.159
Take care of them first.

00:51:52.159 --> 00:51:58.159
Nor did she spend this inordinate amount of time justifying and vindicating herself.

00:51:58.159 --> 00:52:01.159
She simply explained, I'm not drunk.

00:52:01.159 --> 00:52:03.159
And moved on.

00:52:03.159 --> 00:52:09.159
She didn't obsess and rehash mentally over and over again the incident.

00:52:09.159 --> 00:52:12.159
Does he really think I was drunk?

00:52:12.159 --> 00:52:14.159
Does he still believe I'm drunk?

00:52:14.159 --> 00:52:16.159
He didn't do that.

00:52:16.159 --> 00:52:17.159
No.

00:52:17.159 --> 00:52:23.159
Hannah continued to show that Jehovah understood her situation.

00:52:23.159 --> 00:52:31.159
The Bible says clearly she ate and drank and her face became self or no longer downcast.

00:52:32.159 --> 00:52:41.159
She was confident her deeds and motives were rightly evaluated by Jehovah as we see here in verse 3.

00:52:41.159 --> 00:52:45.469
Now, what about Samuel?

00:52:45.469 --> 00:52:54.469
Samuel kept the miracle going as he allowed the sentiments of that prayer help him to overcome discouragement.

00:52:54.469 --> 00:53:00.469
For example, he tirelessly encouraged his brothers to subdue the Philistines,

00:53:00.469 --> 00:53:03.469
to worship Jehovah with a complete heart.

00:53:03.469 --> 00:53:09.469
And yet after decades of pouring himself out for his brothers, the hard work that he did,

00:53:09.469 --> 00:53:14.469
he was rejected by the very, very people that he was trying to help.

00:53:14.469 --> 00:53:18.469
But that did not stop him from serving Jehovah God.

00:53:18.469 --> 00:53:25.469
Nor did it cripple him from supporting a major organizational adjustment in his day.

00:53:25.469 --> 00:53:29.469
That is, going from the time period of the judges to the kings.

00:53:29.469 --> 00:53:31.469
He supported that.

00:53:31.469 --> 00:53:41.469
Why? Because Samuel is confident he knew that his deeds, his works, his motives were rightly evaluated by Jehovah.

00:53:41.469 --> 00:53:43.469
Now, it's your turn.

00:53:43.469 --> 00:53:52.469
Will you keep the miracle of this prayer going as you trust that your deeds are rightly evaluated by Jehovah?

00:53:52.469 --> 00:53:57.469
For example, today, we all have work assignments.

00:53:57.469 --> 00:54:00.469
Tomorrow, those assignments might change.

00:54:00.469 --> 00:54:07.469
If a change comes due to some organizational adjustment or shifting circumstances, this is what happens.

00:54:07.469 --> 00:54:15.469
But you don't want to second guess yourself worth or your confidence or the confidence that Jehovah God has in you.

00:54:16.469 --> 00:54:22.469
Continue to trust Jehovah and realize that he has interest in you as a person.

00:54:22.469 --> 00:54:25.469
You're not dedicated to a work or an assignment.

00:54:25.469 --> 00:54:27.469
You're dedicated to Jehovah God.

00:54:27.469 --> 00:54:29.469
That never changes. That dedication.

00:54:29.469 --> 00:54:32.469
It's true and it's constant.

00:54:32.469 --> 00:54:38.469
It's Jehovah's approval. That's the important thing that you always want to focus on.

00:54:38.469 --> 00:54:46.469
You keep the miracle of the prayer going when you trust that your motives are rightly evaluated by Jehovah.

00:54:46.469 --> 00:54:48.469
You're motives. That's the key.

00:54:48.469 --> 00:54:56.469
Now, how many times, again, in class, if we discussed motive, motive, Matthew 11 verse 19,

00:54:56.469 --> 00:55:02.469
we take to heart that Bible principle. Wisdom is vindicated by its works.

00:55:03.469 --> 00:55:09.469
Hannah knew that. Hannah lived that and we encourage you to do the same.

00:55:09.469 --> 00:55:19.469
So if you are misunderstood, which will happen from time to time, or someone says something unkind about you,

00:55:19.469 --> 00:55:27.469
and that too may happen, don't overreact and say or do things that you will regret later.

00:55:28.469 --> 00:55:34.469
As one writer put it, don't worry about what negative things people say about you.

00:55:34.469 --> 00:55:38.469
Just live your life in a way that no one will believe it.

00:55:38.469 --> 00:55:48.739
Now let's go back to chapter 2 and let's look at verse 8.

00:55:48.739 --> 00:55:53.739
Hannah says, he Jehovah raises the lowly one from the dust.

00:55:53.739 --> 00:55:56.739
He lifts up the poor from the ash heap.

00:55:56.739 --> 00:56:01.739
Hannah knew that from personal experience. She knew that.

00:56:01.739 --> 00:56:07.739
Hannah felt Jehovah's compassion in his dealing with her lowly and humiliated condition.

00:56:07.739 --> 00:56:17.739
She knew that. These words must have deeply touched even David because he used very similar wording at Psalm 113 and verse 7.

00:56:17.739 --> 00:56:23.739
Therefore, even in David's day, he continued the miracle of this prayer.

00:56:23.739 --> 00:56:26.739
And now again, it's your turn.

00:56:26.739 --> 00:56:34.739
You keep the miracle going by reviving the spirit of the lowly ones and the heart of those being crushed,

00:56:34.739 --> 00:56:37.739
lifting them up out of the ash heap.

00:56:37.739 --> 00:56:46.739
Now we know you can do that because we've observed how you've treated each other for the past five months as classmates.

00:56:46.739 --> 00:56:53.739
When you sensed a fellow student was down in the dump, in the ash heap, what did you do?

00:56:53.739 --> 00:56:57.739
You did something about it. You lifted them out. We watched that.

00:56:57.739 --> 00:57:02.739
And that is why as a class, you become inseparable, especially you four sisters.

00:57:02.739 --> 00:57:05.739
You go everywhere together. You eat together. You do everything.

00:57:05.739 --> 00:57:10.739
You're like glue. But it's only been five months.

00:57:10.739 --> 00:57:16.739
How did that happen? It's because of your personal interest in each other.

00:57:16.739 --> 00:57:20.739
So here's the point. Now you're going to your assignments.

00:57:20.739 --> 00:57:27.739
Will you continue to show that same keen interest that you showed in each other with your classmates?

00:57:27.739 --> 00:57:33.739
Will you show that same interest in others in your assignments?

00:57:33.739 --> 00:57:35.739
We know you can do it.

00:57:35.739 --> 00:57:42.739
So ask yourself, what could cause my brother to be in the figurative ash heap?

00:57:42.739 --> 00:57:46.739
First you ask yourself, what could even cause him to be there?

00:57:46.739 --> 00:57:52.739
Is it that perhaps he's discouraged because of a spiritual setback?

00:57:52.739 --> 00:57:55.739
Was he or she overlooked?

00:57:55.739 --> 00:57:59.739
Do they feel not appreciated? Are there works not appreciated?

00:57:59.739 --> 00:58:06.739
Will I notice someone in the dump, especially ones who appear insignificant from a human standpoint?

00:58:06.739 --> 00:58:13.739
Will I come to their aid just as quickly as I came to the aid of my fellow classmates during these five months?

00:58:13.739 --> 00:58:22.739
Will I give those who have made mistakes another chance when I see they have grown and matured?

00:58:22.739 --> 00:58:31.739
Remember that you don't want to view weaker ones as a liability or allow procedures to become more important than people.

00:58:31.739 --> 00:58:36.739
We are not a military organization. We are a family.

00:58:36.739 --> 00:58:44.739
And as a family we lift ones out of the ash heap and build bonds of mutual confidence and trust.

00:58:44.739 --> 00:58:51.139
Now let's go back to chapter 2 and this time we're going to read verse 9.

00:58:51.139 --> 00:58:57.139
This prayer is wonderful and you're going to keep the miracle of this prayer going in your own life.

00:58:57.139 --> 00:59:02.139
Verse 9, he guards the steps of his loyal ones.

00:59:02.139 --> 00:59:05.139
That's what Hannah said. Jehovah guards the steps of the loyal ones.

00:59:05.139 --> 00:59:10.139
I've seen that Hannah could connect the dots.

00:59:10.139 --> 00:59:13.139
I know Jehovah gave me this son.

00:59:13.139 --> 00:59:21.139
So I trust that if he gave me this son and I bring him to the tabernacle that Jehovah is going to take care of him.

00:59:21.139 --> 00:59:23.139
She could connect the dots.

00:59:23.139 --> 00:59:27.139
She didn't reason. I'm not going to bring my little boy to the tabernacle.

00:59:27.139 --> 00:59:33.139
I'm not going to bring him to Shiloh until I see Jehovah clean things up in Shiloh.

00:59:33.139 --> 00:59:39.139
When I see half-nigh infinius remove, then I know I'll bring my boy there but not one minute beforehand.

00:59:39.139 --> 00:59:42.139
She did not say that.

00:59:42.139 --> 00:59:52.139
Hannah was loyal to Jehovah's arrangements that were in place at the time and she was confident that Jehovah guards the loyal ones.

00:59:52.139 --> 00:59:54.139
She knew that.

00:59:54.139 --> 00:59:58.139
Samuel, he too could connect the dots.

00:59:58.139 --> 01:00:03.139
He knew his birth was the result of a miracle.

01:00:03.139 --> 01:00:08.139
As he grew up, he saw Jehovah's hand at work in his own life.

01:00:08.139 --> 01:00:11.139
He witnessed prophecies being fulfilled.

01:00:11.139 --> 01:00:13.139
He could connect the dots.

01:00:13.139 --> 01:00:17.139
You see, Jehovah was real to Samuel.

01:00:17.139 --> 01:00:20.139
Therefore, he too could reason as his mother.

01:00:20.139 --> 01:00:25.139
If I am loyal to Jehovah, he will protect and guard me.

01:00:25.139 --> 01:00:27.139
He kept that miracle going.

01:00:27.139 --> 01:00:30.139
It wasn't always easy though for Samuel.

01:00:30.139 --> 01:00:32.139
How many memories?

01:00:32.139 --> 01:00:35.139
How many tears?

01:00:35.139 --> 01:00:39.139
Filled his little sleeveless coat.

01:00:39.139 --> 01:00:46.139
His mother's signature piece, the label could have read, made by Hannah.

01:00:46.139 --> 01:00:57.139
How many nights did he cry himself to sleep as a little boy thinking of home or the corrupting influence of Eli's sons?

01:00:58.139 --> 01:01:08.139
Yet his life course proved he was no mama's boy, but a leader loyal to Jehovah and his arrangements.

01:01:08.139 --> 01:01:10.139
And now it's your turn.

01:01:10.139 --> 01:01:14.139
You keep the miracle of this prayer going.

01:01:14.139 --> 01:01:20.139
How by being convinced that Jehovah guards the loyal ones.

01:01:21.139 --> 01:01:29.139
Now, as Brother Kaufman mentioned, due to your imperfection or the imperfection of others, things will not always be easy for you.

01:01:29.139 --> 01:01:33.139
As you serve in God's organization, you know that.

01:01:33.139 --> 01:01:40.139
But trust that if you loyally do what is right, Jehovah will guard you.

01:01:40.139 --> 01:01:46.139
And just as Samuel helped to stabilize the national organization in his day,

01:01:46.139 --> 01:01:55.139
we are confident that you too, with your training, will stabilize and encourage Jehovah's little sheep.

01:01:55.139 --> 01:01:59.139
In fact, this is your job.

01:01:59.139 --> 01:02:02.139
This is now your commission.

01:02:02.139 --> 01:02:09.139
Because of your Gilead training and graduation, it's as if the governing body is handing you a silver talent in telling you,

01:02:09.139 --> 01:02:14.139
now you go to business, go to business, they trust you.

01:02:14.139 --> 01:02:22.139
Gilead school has given you the key to unlock a deeper relationship with Jehovah, more meaningful relationship with him.

01:02:22.139 --> 01:02:33.139
And therefore we know with his help you will continue to do the right, noble and spiritual thing as you rub shoulders each day with your brothers and sisters.

01:02:33.139 --> 01:02:36.139
Now that's up to you.

01:02:36.139 --> 01:02:53.139
May your signature piece or your trademark be one that sticks to Jehovah and his organizational arrangements, trusting your Heavenly Father to strengthen you to do his work his way.

01:02:53.139 --> 01:02:56.139
So now what do we want you to remember?

01:02:56.139 --> 01:02:59.139
We want you to remember this.

01:02:59.139 --> 01:03:08.139
Like Hannah and Samuel, take comfort in knowing your deeds, your motives are being rightly evaluated by Jehovah.

01:03:08.139 --> 01:03:11.139
That is so important.

01:03:11.139 --> 01:03:18.139
Show compassion by lifting your brothers from the ash heap.

01:03:18.139 --> 01:03:26.139
Trust in Jehovah's arrangements having full confidence that he guards loyal ones, be loyal.

01:03:26.139 --> 01:03:54.739
And it is our prayer that the theocratic education that you have received at Gilead school has imparted to you the wisdom and the strength to keep the miracle going.

01:03:54.739 --> 01:03:57.739
There are many other things but the Numerian emphasized loyalty.

01:03:57.739 --> 01:04:06.739
It's appropriate therefore that when we can stand and sing together the song entitled Ever Loyal.

01:04:06.739 --> 01:04:10.739
It's based on Psalm 1825.
