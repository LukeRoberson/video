00:00:04.179 --> 00:00:10.460
Sri Lanka is a little island situated just below the Indian subcontinent and is renowned

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:16.070
for its natural beauty.

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:21.390
The recently expanded facilities at the branch office in Wattala were dedicated on January

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.149
11, 2014.

00:00:25.149 --> 00:00:31.030
Preparatory to the dedication event, much work was involved, special effort was made to

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:37.250
give a very local touch to the setting.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:43.369
Which was done by many willing workers in preparing for this special event.

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:54.020
Many volunteers from nearby congregations shared in the Preparatory work.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.539
Even members of the Bethel family joined in helping out after their work day was over and

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:00.979
on weekends.

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:07.420
It was a joyful time as everyone worked together as one happy family to make this event a success

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:23.799
and to bring glory to Chihuahua.

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:49.689
The visiting guests were made to feel comfortable with both handcrafted gifts and artwork.

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:55.250
Soon our visitors 130 delegates from 19 countries started arriving.

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:05.900
They were warmly welcomed by the Bethel family in a traditionally Sri Lankan style.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:13.340
Soon that happy day arrived, specially invited guests started pouring in in an orderly fashion.

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:19.259
It was beautiful to see people of all races mingle together as one family.

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:24.020
The kitchen staff worked all hours to prepare food for the 900 guests for the dedication

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:31.139
program.

00:02:31.139 --> 00:02:35.860
The program reviewed the progress of construction and the history of the work in the country

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:41.699
and included experiences from visiting delegates.

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:47.300
The highlight was the dedication talk delivered by Brother Mark Sanderson, a member of the

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.300
governing body.

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.580
He highlighted three ways in which we may engage in the work of building as God's fellow

00:02:53.580 --> 00:03:04.680
workers to his praise.

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:11.069
After a heartfelt prayer, the program concluded.

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:15.310
The guests from overseas were then treated to refreshments and a meal that was traditionally

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:26.389
Sri Lankan with locally flavored music in the background.

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:30.870
The entire country was invited to a special meeting at four locations on the following

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:31.870
Sunday.

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:35.870
A local indoor stadium was the main center.

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.270
All other locations were tied in by video.

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:45.509
Those separated by distance, everyone felt part of one big spiritual family under our

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:58.770
Heavenly Father.

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:02.889
The highlight of this meeting was the talk delivered by Brother Sanderson.

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:10.800
He considered the subject of how we may maintain joy despite trials.

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.800
This was an unforgettable occasion for all the brothers.

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:20.540
There was a total attendance of 7,701.

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:24.899
This has been a truly historic occasion in the geographic history in the little island

00:04:24.899 --> 00:04:26.660
of Sri Lanka.

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:31.139
The enlarged facilities at the branch of this will surely be a center to promote pure

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:35.939
worship in a country whose fields are truly ripe for harvesting.
