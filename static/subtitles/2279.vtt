00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:20.300
Noah walked with Jehovah. He was pleasing in God's eyes.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:27.300
He stuck close to his family. They wanted to do what's right.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:34.299
They worked hard to build an ark, to save them from the flood.

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:41.299
They listened to Jehovah and they preached to everyone.

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:51.439
He was faithful to Jehovah and as the flood got closer,

00:00:51.439 --> 00:01:04.780
he preached until the end. I too be like Noah to Jehovah.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:20.230
I can be God's friend now preaching. There were people who made fun.

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:27.230
But Noah kept his family safe until the work was done.

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:39.079
He was violent and bad and they found joy.

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:51.359
They made Jehovah glad to Jehovah. The flood got closer.

00:01:51.359 --> 00:02:04.560
He preached until the end. I too be like Noah to Jehovah.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:14.539
The flood got closer.
