00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:28.219
How did 15 years go by so fast?

00:00:28.219 --> 00:00:31.219
We were so young when we got married.

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:33.219
Maybe too young.

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:50.859
We had so little in common.

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:53.259
When I started studying the Bible,

00:00:53.259 --> 00:00:57.259
I thought Thomas would be as excited as I was to learn the truth.

00:00:57.259 --> 00:01:23.099
But every conversation we had on the subject seemed to turn into an argument.

00:01:23.099 --> 00:01:30.459
Looking back, I really wish I'd handled it better.

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.060
As the years went by,

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:51.620
he did become more open to discussion.

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.620
But it's been hard worshipping God alone.

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.620
Others in the congregation are able to serve Jehovah together

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:04.219
and even reach out for theocratic goals like the School for Kingdom Evangelisers.

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:07.420
Something I would love to do.

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.819
Why can't I have a husband who loves Jehovah like I do?

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.620
Abigail probably felt the same way.

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:21.969
But with more reason.

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:24.969
Her husband was a bully and a drunkard

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:47.479
and was despised by his entire household.

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:50.479
At that time, many marriages were arranged

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:56.580
so Abigail had very little control over her circumstances.

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.180
But her words and actions showed that she was a spiritual woman

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.979
who didn't focus on what she could not control.

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:05.900
But what she could.

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.300
I determined to do the same.

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:13.300
I meditated on Jesus' words at Matthew chapter 19 verse 6

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:18.659
what God has yoke together, let no man put apart.

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:21.460
To Jehovah, marriage is permanent.

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:24.460
Even my marriage to an unbeliever.

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:28.259
So instead of dwelling on changing my husband or my marriage,

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:31.659
I focused on changing myself.

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:36.460
Thomas does not love Jehovah, but he's no neighbor either.

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:39.060
He is loyal and he loves me.

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.060
He is entitled to respect the Bible Command's wives to show their husbands.

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:48.460
So I'm making an effort to be more respectful and loving to him.

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:52.659
Thomas hasn't developed an interest in the truth or started studying.

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:57.460
But I have the satisfaction of knowing my God is pleased with me.

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:01.259
And I have the same view of marriage that he does.
