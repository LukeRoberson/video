00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:04.780
First, we'd like you to meet Aynura.

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:09.779
She's a single sister who faces persecution for an extended period of time.

00:00:09.779 --> 00:00:15.779
But today, she has truly lived up to the word stated in Psalm 68-11.

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:17.780
Jehovah gives the command.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.780
The women proclaiming the good news are a large army.

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:27.460
I was born in Kazakhstan.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.460
When I was 14 years old,

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.460
we moved to the country of my family.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.460
And people there are very prejudiced.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.460
They don't like when somebody chose his own way of living.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:53.079
When I was 18, a classmate told me about Armageddon.

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:57.079
I was frightened a little bit in the beginning.

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:00.079
But I wanted to learn more.

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:08.079
And I started to read publications of Jehovah's Witnesses that she gave me.

00:01:08.079 --> 00:01:16.079
And from the beginning, I realized that I found people that I was looking for,

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:22.079
people without prejudice, without pride, different nationalities,

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:25.079
but living in different countries.

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:33.079
And that was like taking a deep breath of hope.

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:36.079
But my family was not very happy.

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:49.829
So several times when I tried to read Bible at home,

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:54.829
but hiding in the corner or somewhere,

00:01:54.829 --> 00:02:00.140
they didn't want me to go to the meetings,

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:06.140
even to keep in touch with my friends with no one.

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:11.139
So they kept me at home for several months.

00:02:11.139 --> 00:02:19.189
Because of this, I had to keep in secret my going to the meetings.

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:21.189
I was very scared.

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:33.259
They wanted me to be like other people.

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:37.259
They threw away all my literature

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:43.780
and they burned my Bible.

00:02:43.780 --> 00:03:04.009
My friends told me about the love they saw at the conventions.

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:07.009
So I wanted to experience this.

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:12.009
But I knew that my family would never allow me to go there.

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:21.009
So I wrote a letter and left knowing what would happen when I come home.

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:26.009
But a brother, the convention, he told me,

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:32.009
if I give up, my family would never had any chance to come to the truth.

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:35.610
Over the next several years,

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.610
persecution got even worse.

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:42.610
All that I was baptized and pioneering,

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:48.610
I felt that I couldn't make any spiritual progress anymore.

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:52.610
This dress affected my health,

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:55.610
creating brush over my skin.

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:10.849
There were days when I wanted just to close my eyes and never wake up.

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:15.849
But Jehovah did not forget about me when I thought that I had no strength

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:17.850
to continue to grow spiritually.

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.850
I got an assignment in special full-time service.

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:26.850
As if Jehovah reached in, put his arms around me

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:30.850
and pulled out of my circumstances.

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:33.850
And he gave me freedom.

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:36.850
I was like a bird.

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:42.850
I had no fear anymore and could serve Jehovah freely as I wanted to.

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:46.850
I could freely go to the meetings.

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:53.850
I could read literature, publication, at home.

00:04:53.850 --> 00:05:00.850
I could go to the service without fearing what can happen when I come back.

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:04.850
And I could go to the conventions.

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:12.160
Jehovah gave me a blessing that I never thought about.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:17.160
To be a student of the 100 to the 8 class of Gilead.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:22.139
And now I'm here.

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:27.139
And for all single sisters, I would like to say that Jehovah never forgets

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:30.139
every little thing that you do for him.

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:33.139
He will help you to progress.

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:38.139
He can use anybody anywhere to do his will.

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:53.589
I still do things by myself.

00:05:53.589 --> 00:05:57.589
But with Jehovah, I'm not alone.
