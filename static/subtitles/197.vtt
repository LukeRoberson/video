00:00:01.389 --> 00:00:07.889
Through his prophet Isaiah, Jehovah made a wonderful promise for this being fulfilled today.

00:00:07.889 --> 00:00:13.390
We can read about it at Isaiah 60 and verse 17.

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:17.390
Instead of the copper, I will bring in gold.

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.390
And instead of the iron, I will bring in silver.

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:25.390
Instead of the wood, copper, and instead of the stones, iron.

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:32.390
And I will appoint peace as your overseers and righteousness as your task assigners.

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:39.390
And all this reference to overseers and task assigners, that sounds like organization, doesn't it?

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.390
So what is Jehovah telling us?

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:48.390
He's saying that we can expect to see organizational arrangements getting better and better.

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.390
Well, if you've been associated with the truth for a while, I'm sure you'll agree that

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.390
Isaiah's prophecy is being fulfilled today.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:04.390
So for this broadcast, I thought we'd review some of the improvements we've seen just since World War II.

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.390
That's the period most of us are familiar with.

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.390
Now some of you will be hearing about these things for the first time.

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.390
Others will live live through it all.

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.390
And for them, it'll bring back fond memories.

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.390
So let's go back. It'll be fun.

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.390
I call this part, do you remember when?

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.640
Before World War II.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:33.640
And for a number of years after that, many congregations didn't have a kingdom hall of their own.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:39.640
And they were actually encouraged to meet in private homes or in rented facilities.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:45.640
The thinking was that if you were in a rented facility or a private home, you had more flexibility.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.640
You could move the meeting place from one place to the other very easily.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.640
But there were problems or a drawbacks.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.640
Sometimes the space would be shared with other organizations.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:04.640
So you couldn't leave your literature, magazine, speaker stand, and maybe even a sound system in the hall at the end of the meeting.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:10.639
When the meeting was over, you'd have to pack it all up and take it away.

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:12.639
But that's not all.

00:02:12.639 --> 00:02:20.639
Sometimes you had to arrive very early and click the place up after a particularly rowdy group of people had used it.

00:02:20.639 --> 00:02:24.639
And if there were cigar smokers in that group, you were in trouble.

00:02:24.639 --> 00:02:29.639
It was very difficult to air the place out in time for the meeting.

00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:34.639
Now remember, in those days, people could smoke in a private hall.

00:02:34.639 --> 00:02:37.639
And you could smoke in an airplane. They could smoke almost anywhere.

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:40.639
So this was a real problem for us.

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:43.639
There were other problems.

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:48.639
Before we had a kingdom hall in my hometown, the congregation met in a rented facility.

00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:52.639
Now in October, the place was decorated for Halloween.

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:57.639
And in December, there was a great big Christmas tree on the platform.

00:02:57.639 --> 00:02:58.639
We couldn't move it.

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:00.639
And now this was in Canada.

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:04.639
And portraits of the king and queen of England as well as the British flag

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:07.639
were permanent fixtures in the hall.

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:10.639
You couldn't remove any of it for the meeting.

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:15.639
Yet, to their credit, many interested persons attended our meetings.

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:18.639
And to them, it wasn't the meeting place that was important.

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:22.639
It was what they were learning there that counted.

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:29.639
Speaking of our meeting places, at first congregations were on their own when it came to building them.

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:33.639
Now at times, the most a congregation could afford was to purchase the land.

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:36.639
And sometimes, that land would sit there for years,

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:42.639
because it would take years to get the money together to build the hall.

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:45.639
And then, once they had the money together,

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:49.639
were there enough brothers who could take the lead in the construction?

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:55.639
Sometimes on a weekend, you see just one or two brothers working away at the side of the new hall.

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:59.639
They had to love them for their perseverance.

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:05.639
Nowadays, our Kingdom Hall construction is supervised by the LDCs with lots of qualified volunteers

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:11.639
and practical Kingdom Halls can be constructed in a short period of time.

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:13.639
What about the meetings?

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:21.639
For years, the ministry school, service meeting, congregation book study, and watchtower study were all about an hour in length.

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:25.639
So were the public talks when we had them.

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:29.639
Not first, a public talk wasn't scheduled every week.

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:34.639
It would be a series of four or eight talks if you could schedule that many speakers.

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:38.639
And then for a while, the congregation wouldn't have a public talk.

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:40.639
What was that?

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:45.639
Remember, the Theocratic ministry school didn't get underway until 1943,

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:50.639
and it took time for the brothers to develop the skills to deliver an hour talk.

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:56.639
But in time, they were delivering excellent public talks.

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:01.639
And do you remember when we had individual handbills for each public talk,

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:06.660
with the name of the speaker branded on them?

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:11.660
Until 1959, only brothers were enrolled in the school.

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:15.660
For some years, during the first few minutes of the school, there was a rule call.

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:19.660
And the names of all the brothers enrolled in the school were read out.

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:23.660
When your name was read out, you were to answer present.

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:28.660
A few rebels would say, here, but you were supposed to say present.

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:34.660
Now, initially, according to the instructions, if anyone was deliberately and habitually absent

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:38.660
over a period of time, he was dropped from the school.

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:42.660
Later, that was discontinued.

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:46.660
Now, the rule call arrangement got me into a bit of trouble.

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:50.660
You see, in our congregation, when the rule was being called each week,

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:54.660
I noticed that there were a few young brothers who were just a little bit older than I was,

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:56.660
who would answer present.

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:00.660
So one night, after the school, I asked the school servant

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:03.660
if I could have my name read out at the next meeting.

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:09.660
He warmly commanded me, and sure enough, I got my name read out the following week.

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:12.660
Everyone congratulated me after the meeting.

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:15.660
Couldn't understand why. I only said present.

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:20.660
Problem was, I didn't know that when you got your name read out,

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:22.660
you were agreeing to give a talk.

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:26.660
I thought I was just signing up to have my name read out.

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:33.660
Well, a couple of months later, on April the 8th, 1953, I delivered my first eight-minute talk

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:37.660
on the theme, Proclaiming the World's Noom.

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:41.660
Now, why an eight-minute talk? Well, we didn't have Bible readings yet.

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:46.660
So when you were on the school, you were giving an eight-minute talk.

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:53.660
Well, today, we make sure everyone understands what's involved in being a student in the midweek meeting.

00:06:53.660 --> 00:07:00.660
In 1950, we received the New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures in English,

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:02.660
and we were encouraged to bring it to the meetings.

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:07.660
So for the Hebrew Scriptures, you'd have the American Standard Version or the Ting James Version,

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:12.660
mostly the American Standard Version because it had Jehovah's name.

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:14.660
So you'd have two Bibles to bring to the meeting.

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:19.660
There's the one for the Hebrew Scriptures, and then the New World Translation for the Greek Scriptures.

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:22.660
Two Bibles, it wasn't too bad.

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:28.660
But later, the New World Translation of the Hebrew Scriptures was released in installments.

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:33.660
So you'd get a volume every year or two, and as we received each new volume,

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:36.660
we were encouraged to bring it to the meeting.

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:40.660
How in time, those volumes started to pile up.

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:45.660
So that by 1960, you might have volumes one through five of the Hebrew Scriptures,

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:49.660
and the Greek Scriptures, and your regular study aids,

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:52.660
and we had thick study aids in those days.

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:56.660
We had big briefcases and strong backs in those days.

00:07:56.660 --> 00:08:05.800
We were really happy to get the complete New World Translation in just one volume in 1961.

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:10.800
Well, let's say a word about music. That's something that's near and dear to my heart.

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:16.800
For many years, it was left up to the local servants to decide which songs the congregation would sing at the meeting.

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:20.800
So the chairman of a particular meeting would select the songs.

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.800
But his choice wasn't always final.

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:28.800
Many Kingdom Halls had a piano or some other instrument to accompany the singing,

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:32.799
but often the musician couldn't play all the songs in the book.

00:08:32.799 --> 00:08:36.799
So we'd have to sing the songs he could play.

00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:40.799
We got to know those few songs really well,

00:08:40.799 --> 00:08:44.799
but those humble musicians did their best to accompany our singing.

00:08:44.799 --> 00:08:50.799
As a result of all this, the words to those songs we sang nearly 70 years ago

00:08:50.799 --> 00:08:52.799
still come readily to mind.

00:08:52.799 --> 00:08:59.080
Do you remember the written review? Maybe you don't.

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:07.080
Congregations periodically had a written review of material that had been covered in the ministry school over the previous weeks.

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:11.080
We had a half hour to answer about 25 questions.

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:16.080
But then when the half hour was up, we would write our name on the paper,

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:19.080
hand it into the school servant,

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:22.080
and he would take all the papers home to grade them.

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:29.080
Now, if there were 25 questions, you'd get four points a piece for each correct answer, a hundred points total.

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:34.080
And then a week later, he'd return the papers to us at the meeting.

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:37.080
Now, in the early years of the arrangement, I remember well.

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:42.080
He'd announced the highest and lowest grade to the congregation.

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:47.080
Well, thankfully, he didn't mention the names of the one who got the highest and lowest score.

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:52.080
Well, later that arrangement to announce the highest and lowest grade was discontinued.

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:59.080
Do you remember when circuit assemblies began on Friday evening and continued through Sunday afternoon?

00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:04.080
A full program was presented Saturday afternoon and evening.

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:07.080
There was never a dull moment on Saturday night.

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:12.080
There were lively demonstrations that kept our interest right up to the end of the program.

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:17.389
Sometimes the sets were very elaborate.

00:10:17.389 --> 00:10:22.389
For example, suppose a publisher was demonstrating a presentation from door to door.

00:10:22.389 --> 00:10:26.389
Not today, we just imagine there was a door.

00:10:26.389 --> 00:10:32.389
But back then, at the circuit assembly, there might be a frame with a painted door on the stage,

00:10:32.389 --> 00:10:36.389
and maybe even a doorbell for the publisher to ring.

00:10:36.389 --> 00:10:40.389
Now, if the householder was supposed to be interested, you knew it,

00:10:40.389 --> 00:10:43.389
because the house number was 777.

00:10:43.389 --> 00:10:47.389
And if the householder was going to be opposed, you knew that as well,

00:10:47.389 --> 00:10:51.389
because the house number would be 666.

00:10:51.389 --> 00:10:55.389
Now, on one program I remember, the publisher knocks on the door,

00:10:55.389 --> 00:10:58.389
and a brother dressed as a priest answers.

00:10:58.389 --> 00:11:01.389
He puts up a real argument about the Trinity.

00:11:01.389 --> 00:11:08.389
Talk about visual aids, but you never forgot what you saw and heard.

00:11:08.389 --> 00:11:13.389
And do you remember when each congregation had a congregation servant,

00:11:13.389 --> 00:11:17.389
and up to seven other servants, the assistant congregation servant,

00:11:17.389 --> 00:11:22.389
the Bible study servant, the account servant, the watchtower study servant,

00:11:22.389 --> 00:11:25.389
the magazine territory servant, the literature servant,

00:11:25.389 --> 00:11:27.389
and the ministry school servant?

00:11:27.389 --> 00:11:30.389
Now, about time, apart from book study conductors,

00:11:30.389 --> 00:11:35.389
you couldn't have more than eight servants in the congregation.

00:11:35.389 --> 00:11:42.389
So, unless someone moved, a young man had no chance of becoming a servant.

00:11:42.389 --> 00:11:46.389
So, how could a young man reach out for more responsibility?

00:11:46.389 --> 00:11:53.389
And, how would the prophecy recorded at Micah 55 ever be fulfilled?

00:11:53.389 --> 00:11:58.389
There, Jehovah promised, we will raise up against him seven shepherds,

00:11:58.389 --> 00:12:02.389
yes, eight princes of mankind.

00:12:02.389 --> 00:12:06.389
While seven represents completeness, so eight princes,

00:12:06.389 --> 00:12:10.389
I would indicate that there would be more than enough men in the congregations

00:12:10.389 --> 00:12:12.389
to provide theocratic direction.

00:12:12.389 --> 00:12:18.389
But how could that be when there was basically a limit of eight servants for congregation?

00:12:18.389 --> 00:12:22.389
The answer came in 1971.

00:12:22.389 --> 00:12:27.389
We were thrilled when we understood that each congregation has a body of elders,

00:12:27.389 --> 00:12:31.389
and there was no set number of elders or ministerial servants,

00:12:31.389 --> 00:12:34.389
as many as are qualified, can be appointed.

00:12:34.389 --> 00:12:40.700
Now, when I was baptized 66 years ago,

00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:44.700
it didn't have to be approved for baptism by the congregation.

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:48.700
And the only questions asked of baptism candidates were the two they answered

00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:51.700
at the conclusion of the baptism talk.

00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:54.700
That led to a few strange situations.

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:58.700
On a few occasions, much of the surprise of the servants,

00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:02.700
someone would rush up to the front of the hall at the end of the baptism talk,

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:07.700
answer the two questions, and get baptized.

00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:10.700
Something more was needed.

00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:13.700
Assurance that the individual really knew what he was doing,

00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:17.700
and especially that he was living in harmony with scriptural principles.

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:22.700
So, in 1967, questions were provided

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:26.700
so that the responsible brothers could be assured that each candidate

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:29.700
was truly qualified for baptism.

00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:32.700
Those questions have been refined over the years,

00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:38.700
and today, we go over some 60 questions with baptism candidates.

00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:42.700
The copper has turned to gold.

00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:46.700
Do you remember when there were very few pictures in our publications?

00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:51.700
And the few we had, usually in black and white, are only two colors.

00:13:52.700 --> 00:14:00.429
Today, our spiritual food is served in attractive publications in full color.

00:14:00.429 --> 00:14:04.429
Now, those of us who have served in four language congregations will also remember

00:14:04.429 --> 00:14:11.429
when a new publication in English might not be available in another language for several years.

00:14:11.429 --> 00:14:15.429
Study articles, trailed by several months.

00:14:15.429 --> 00:14:20.429
That's before it became possible for the branches to do simultaneous printing.

00:14:20.429 --> 00:14:22.429
Here's how it worked.

00:14:22.429 --> 00:14:25.429
Material in English would be mailed to the branches,

00:14:25.429 --> 00:14:28.429
regular mail, for translation.

00:14:28.429 --> 00:14:32.429
And if the translators had a question about the meaning of a sentence in English,

00:14:32.429 --> 00:14:36.429
they would use regular mail to send their question to headquarters.

00:14:36.429 --> 00:14:40.429
In time, headquarters would answer back by regular mail.

00:14:40.429 --> 00:14:43.429
And this back and forth, it could take quite a while,

00:14:43.429 --> 00:14:47.429
and in some countries, mail service was poor.

00:14:47.429 --> 00:14:52.429
Now, today, thanks to special computer programs or brothers have developed

00:14:52.429 --> 00:14:56.429
and the ability to communicate electronically and some other factors,

00:14:56.429 --> 00:15:01.429
we're able to release most language editions simultaneously with the English.

00:15:01.429 --> 00:15:05.429
What, an improvement?

00:15:05.429 --> 00:15:07.429
Now, speaking of our literature,

00:15:07.429 --> 00:15:14.429
do you realize that it's been some 31 years since the decision was made that in the United States,

00:15:14.429 --> 00:15:18.429
we'd no longer ask for a contribution for our literature?

00:15:18.429 --> 00:15:21.429
Later, the arrangement was extended worldwide.

00:15:21.429 --> 00:15:26.429
That's been a real blessing for our brothers.

00:15:26.429 --> 00:15:31.429
For example, when we were asking for contributions for literature,

00:15:31.429 --> 00:15:35.429
some brothers in Africa and other places couldn't afford to have a watchtower

00:15:35.429 --> 00:15:38.429
for every member of the family.

00:15:38.429 --> 00:15:41.429
They were just too poor.

00:15:41.429 --> 00:15:44.429
And what about bomb books?

00:15:44.429 --> 00:15:47.429
Tell you an experience in one African country.

00:15:47.429 --> 00:15:53.429
A missionary noticed that a young brother quoted a wide variety of scriptures in his comments.

00:15:53.429 --> 00:15:56.429
And he got curious. One day he asked the young brother,

00:15:56.429 --> 00:15:59.429
how did you come to know so many scriptures?

00:15:59.429 --> 00:16:02.429
The brother replied, it's the reasoning book.

00:16:02.429 --> 00:16:06.429
I read it every chance I get.

00:16:06.429 --> 00:16:10.429
The missionary asked him, what do you mean you read it every chance you get?

00:16:11.429 --> 00:16:15.429
Well, he replied, I don't have a reasoning book myself.

00:16:15.429 --> 00:16:17.429
I could never afford one.

00:16:17.429 --> 00:16:19.429
But I know a sister who has one.

00:16:19.429 --> 00:16:22.429
And she lets me borrow it from time to time.

00:16:22.429 --> 00:16:26.429
I read it every chance I get.

00:16:26.429 --> 00:16:29.429
Well, you can imagine.

00:16:29.429 --> 00:16:31.429
The missionary went out and bought him a reasoning book

00:16:31.429 --> 00:16:35.429
and a new world translation for good measure.

00:16:35.429 --> 00:16:37.429
It was a great investment.

00:16:37.429 --> 00:16:40.429
The young brother was later called into Bethel.

00:16:40.429 --> 00:16:42.429
And where do you think he was assigned?

00:16:42.429 --> 00:16:44.429
To the literature department.

00:16:44.429 --> 00:16:46.429
The brother's new.

00:16:46.429 --> 00:16:48.429
He appreciated the literature so much

00:16:48.429 --> 00:16:54.940
that he had made sure the congregations had the literature they needed.

00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:56.940
Well, looking back,

00:16:56.940 --> 00:16:59.940
we can see that the arrangements back then served a purpose.

00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:02.940
They were like fine copper.

00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:05.940
We do not look down on them.

00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:10.940
Rather, we take the view expressed at Zechariah 4.10.

00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:16.940
Who has despised the day of small beginnings?

00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:19.940
There was those taking the lead to saw a better way of doing things.

00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:22.940
They didn't hesitate to make adjustments.

00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:25.940
That's very faith strengthening.

00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:28.940
And the best is yet to come.

00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:32.180
As I mentioned in the beginning,

00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:36.180
this may be the first time that some of you have heard about these things.

00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:39.180
Why not ask someone who has been in the truth for many years?

00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:41.180
What it was like when he was new in the truth?

00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:46.180
That could lead to a very stimulating discussion.
