00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:05.280
Everything about enjoy life forever is different.

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:09.119
From any other publication we've produced in the past, and from the start of the project

00:00:09.119 --> 00:00:14.039
two things were critical, good communication and good documentation, but honestly time

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:18.079
and again the thing that proved to be the most important was Reliance on Jehovah.

00:00:18.079 --> 00:00:22.480
The writing committee's goal was to create a first class digital experience that would

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.000
engage Bible students.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.719
The digital design system had to be completely remodeled so that enjoy life forever would

00:00:29.719 --> 00:00:35.560
look uniform, whether it's viewed in JW Library on JW.org or in print.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:39.960
Right from the inception of this project, the brothers looked for inputs of a study material

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.600
would be easily available in as many languages as possible, and for that reason a team from

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.280
translation services worked along with the writers.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.000
A publication of this size would usually take about two or three years to complete, but

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.679
the writing committee was really interested in getting the enjoy life forever book out

00:00:57.679 --> 00:00:59.479
there as soon as possible.

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:03.119
Enjoy life forever book required an intense amount of collaboration.

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:06.920
Right from the beginning, the writing committee got all six departments together so we could

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.120
work unidely through their production.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.159
Enjoy life forever has many elements.

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:28.519
Over 250 pages of text, 597 images, 121 video boxes, 840 links, and 62 QR codes.

00:01:28.519 --> 00:01:35.519
Also the goal box must allow the student to add text and we had to build alternate layouts

00:01:35.519 --> 00:01:42.799
for languages that have longer text and for languages that read right to the left.

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:47.560
Our existing tool set didn't have the ability to style digital publications like we can

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:48.560
with print.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.719
We could do black text on a white background with gray boxes.

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:56.560
That was the extent of the functionality that we had available.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.840
Enjoy life forever is very interactive for the student.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.760
When producing the audio for this publication, we endeavored to maintain that feel.

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:10.919
So we added multiple voices, musical cues, and in some cases the audio track for the video

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:13.960
was re-edited to teach the point effectively.

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:19.159
When we got to lesson 32, we felt that it might be too complicated to build as a digital

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:22.919
experience, but that's when the collaboration really paid off.

00:02:22.919 --> 00:02:28.039
It took every tool that we had and basically every track in order to build the digital

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:29.960
version of that lesson.

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.919
As we were working on the prototype, we would collaborate with the user experience group

00:02:33.919 --> 00:02:37.680
to make sure that the look and feel of the digital addition was the same whether it was

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.719
on a large device or a small device.

00:02:40.719 --> 00:02:45.360
The entire chart is a visual aid, so we wanted to be sure that all of our users, especially

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.039
those who are visually impaired, would be able to understand the teaching point.

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:54.639
This required us to build the chart so that screen readers could read the text and that

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:58.960
each picture would have a description for those who needed it.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:03.240
Early in the concept stage, we understood that there would be about 200 videos in this publication

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.000
requiring thousands of hours of work.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.639
Eight brand new videos of the remaining videos around 60 would need to be edited.

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:16.639
Just as the eight new videos were entering the production phase, COVID-19 hit, effectively

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:19.560
halting video production around the world.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.479
This work stoppage continued until each branch could determine how they could film safely

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:28.159
and still meet the deadline only nine months away.

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:31.680
Due to the pandemic, photo sessions here at headquarters were completely stopped for

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.159
four months.

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:39.639
Now as things progressed, we were able to resume photography only adhering to strict protocols.

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:43.639
For example, we had a family photograph themselves while being directed by the art department

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:44.639
here.

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:48.919
So everything that a Bible study conductor has been trained to do, ask all the important

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:53.159
questions, develop love for Jehovah in their Bible students, show videos, it's all built

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:55.280
into the publication.

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.479
So would the concept work with actual Bible students?

00:03:58.479 --> 00:04:03.000
To find out we did in-house testing, and then at the same time, we sent out the lessons

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.960
around the world to publishers, pioneers, missionaries, circuit overseers, and they used

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.639
the lessons with actual Bible students.

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:14.479
We tested every lesson of the book this way, and then the responses that we got back

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:17.600
were analyzed and we made further refinements.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.800
We had hundreds of team meetings, and we felt Jehovah's Holy Spirit equipping all of us

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.199
after we opened the meeting with prayer.

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:31.279
When you collaborate, you get a better product, it's more direct, simpler, and easier to understand.

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:35.759
Also thinking ahead about potential transition problems and addressing them helped expedite

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:38.800
translation in hundreds of languages.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:46.639
I saw firsthand how Jehovah uses his organization to give us what we need at the right time, even

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:48.240
with the pandemic.

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:53.439
The results showed me that Jehovah was in control of the project.

00:04:53.439 --> 00:04:57.800
I feel that Jehovah helped us accomplish this job in a shorter amount of time and a

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.920
quality that would have been very difficult, even under normal circumstances.

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:02.920
How amazing is Jehovah?
