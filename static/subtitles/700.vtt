WEBVTT

00:00:03.569 --> 00:00:12.130
Whether this my great pleasure to welcome all of you to this graduation program for the

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:19.250
140th class of the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead, and we're just so happy to have

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:26.329
our auditorium here in Patterson filled with so many happy servants of Jehovah.

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:31.449
And the brothers informed me that all of the satellite locations, including, and this

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:39.009
just a few, Canada, Curacao, Jamaica, and Puerto Rico are all successfully tied in.

00:00:39.009 --> 00:00:45.450
So we're happy to have all these ones tied in with us for this happy occasion.

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:51.450
And the brothers tell me, too, that among us we have guests from at least 40 different

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.250
countries.

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.689
In fact, six of the seven continents are represented here.

00:00:58.689 --> 00:01:08.450
We've got ones from Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, North America, South America, only

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:14.129
Antarctica is not represented.

00:01:14.129 --> 00:01:17.609
But who knows, next year that may change.

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:23.689
But it's really good to have this international gathering of brothers and sisters for this

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:25.370
happy occasion.

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:33.409
Now we can proceed into our joyous occasion by standing and singing together one of our

00:01:33.409 --> 00:04:39.339
beautiful new songs that Jehovah is your name based on Psalm 8318, that song number 138.

00:04:39.339 --> 00:04:50.500
The theme for my opening little discussion is three precious expressions, use them generously.

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:56.100
And especially we're going to direct these comments to you dear Gilead students.

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:00.139
Now when you think of that theme, you may think of this scripture in Proverbs.

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:02.939
Let's go to Proverbs chapter 16.

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:08.019
When you think of precious expressions, we want to use generously.

00:05:08.019 --> 00:05:16.579
You may think of this Proverbs 16 and take a look at verse 21.

00:05:16.579 --> 00:05:22.699
It says, the wise and heart will be called understanding, now notice.

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:28.300
And the one kind in speech adds persuasiveness.

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:32.459
And literally in the footnote, the one sweet of lips.

00:05:32.459 --> 00:05:38.500
And if you think about it kind and sweet of lips, it does persuade, doesn't it?

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:44.540
And these three expressions that we're going to discuss are kind and they're sweet and

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:47.579
they will powerfully persuade.

00:05:47.579 --> 00:05:51.660
But now what is our first precious expression?

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:52.660
Well done.

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.379
Now let's talk about this.

00:05:55.379 --> 00:06:02.420
When we express sincere commendation by saying well done or similar words to family members

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:08.500
or fellow worshipers, we indicate we're not taking for granted the good work that they're doing.

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:10.300
We appreciate it.

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.699
And like Jehovah's always good, isn't it?

00:06:12.699 --> 00:06:15.620
To have an appreciative attitude.

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:22.379
Colossians 3.15 says, show yourselves thankful.

00:06:22.379 --> 00:06:24.100
Didn't say just be thankful.

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:25.939
Show yourself thankful.

00:06:25.939 --> 00:06:31.220
And one way to do that is by offering sincere commendation.

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:32.100
Think about it.

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:38.899
If we sincerely commend one, then it may move them to even more fully.

00:06:38.899 --> 00:06:41.420
Keep up the good work they're doing.

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:44.699
It may even move them to do it more fully.

00:06:44.699 --> 00:06:50.019
See, it is motivating that expression to commend someone.

00:06:50.019 --> 00:06:53.060
But now what about this question here?

00:06:53.060 --> 00:07:02.060
What if a certain fellow worker, perhaps a fellow elder, never, ever gives us a word

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:05.899
of commendation, never any commendation?

00:07:05.899 --> 00:07:07.379
Should we reason?

00:07:07.379 --> 00:07:11.300
Well, I won't commend him either.

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:17.939
You might recall what brother Mark Numer said some years ago in his talk at a Gilead graduation

00:07:17.939 --> 00:07:23.939
program, he made the comment, don't become the thing you hate.

00:07:23.939 --> 00:07:31.819
He warned, if you see behavior that you hate and you become that way, you have become

00:07:31.819 --> 00:07:32.819
what you hate.

00:07:32.819 --> 00:07:35.860
Now that's a powerful point, isn't it?

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:40.939
See, we don't want to become what we don't like or what we even hate.

00:07:40.939 --> 00:07:47.540
And if you think about it, if we go ahead and give that one who never gives us commendation,

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:52.939
sincere commendation, who knows, maybe in time it'll rub off on him that appreciative

00:07:52.939 --> 00:07:54.420
attitude.

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:59.540
But in any event, we'll know we've done the right thing, we'll feel good about it, and

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:02.899
Jehovah will bless us for that.

00:08:02.899 --> 00:08:09.379
At Luke 638, Jehovah tells us to practice giving.

00:08:09.379 --> 00:08:12.100
So not just occasionally, but make it happen.

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:15.379
And one way to do that is giving commendation.

00:08:15.379 --> 00:08:20.620
And of course, our giving should never be dependent upon receiving.

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:25.620
As we always remember, there's more happiness in giving than receiving.

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:29.500
So dear Gilead students, please generously use

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:33.899
those words to commend your fellow workers.

00:08:33.899 --> 00:08:39.220
Use it to strengthen your mate, to inspire young people.

00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:42.259
Use it to motivate Bible students.

00:08:42.259 --> 00:08:45.299
Use it to hearten your fellow workers.

00:08:45.299 --> 00:08:48.299
Those words can work wonders.

00:08:48.299 --> 00:08:53.500
But now let's go to our second short, but precious expression.

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:56.100
I'm sorry.

00:08:56.100 --> 00:09:03.100
When we apologize by saying, I'm sorry, perhaps even adding, please forgive me.

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:09.899
We show how very highly we value the unity with our brothers.

00:09:09.899 --> 00:09:11.500
We want unity with them.

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:17.019
And sincere apologies from the heart with the right tone of voice can again work wonders.

00:09:17.019 --> 00:09:18.899
They are powerful.

00:09:18.899 --> 00:09:26.740
Think about, if you will, the sincere apology that Abigail gave to David when he was on his

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:30.740
way to slaughter the household of Nehbo.

00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:39.059
Now, that apology was given from her, even though she shared no blame for the stupidity

00:09:39.059 --> 00:09:40.779
of her husband.

00:09:40.779 --> 00:09:44.700
But first Samuel, chapter 25 says, she fell at David's feet.

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:50.139
She said, my Lord, let the blame be on me.

00:09:50.139 --> 00:09:54.019
Pardon, please, the transgression of your servant girl.

00:09:54.019 --> 00:09:57.419
Well, that's sincere apology what did it do?

00:09:57.419 --> 00:10:05.419
It transformed a man of vengeance immediately into a man of peace and compassion.

00:10:05.419 --> 00:10:13.460
Or think about the sincere apology of the prodigal son and Jesus parable in Luke chapter 15.

00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:18.220
That heart felt apology immediately melted the heart of the father.

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:22.899
And he accepted the son right back into his household.

00:10:22.899 --> 00:10:27.379
Well, just a couple of examples of the power of a sincere apology.

00:10:27.379 --> 00:10:29.580
But now, here's a question.

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:33.100
What if the problem primarily lies with the offended person?

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:35.259
They're just too sensitive.

00:10:35.259 --> 00:10:38.460
Now, that's why they were offended by us.

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:40.299
Should we still apologize?

00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:48.820
Well, if you think of Jesus' words at Matthew 5, 23, and 24, he said, leave your gift at the altar.

00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:52.940
Go make peace with your offended brother.

00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:58.940
Now, he didn't say go make peace if your brother's offense is legitimate.

00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:01.580
If there's a basis for it now, go make peace.

00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:02.539
No.

00:11:02.539 --> 00:11:04.659
He said, leave your gift, go make peace.

00:11:04.659 --> 00:11:06.500
It was unqualified, wouldn't it?

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:15.299
And when we do this, we show that unity with our brothers is worth a whole lot more than who is right or who is wrong.

00:11:15.299 --> 00:11:16.500
But think of this.

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:23.700
It's usually best not to apologize by saying something like, if I offended you,

00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:28.620
or if you were offended, well, then I'm sorry.

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:34.220
You know, that could come across like you're trying to pin the blame on them for being offended.

00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:45.250
But in contrast, a sincere apology from our heart with no attached subliminal messages.

00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:52.090
See, that's what we'll powerfully reach the heart of that one and enable us to make peace with them.

00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:58.769
But what quality would you say, especially, will enable us to go and make that sincere apology?

00:11:58.769 --> 00:12:01.210
Is it not humility?

00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:08.289
If we're even a little bit prideful, those words, I'm sorry, please forgive me,

00:12:08.289 --> 00:12:11.450
tend to hang up right here in the throat, don't they?

00:12:11.450 --> 00:12:14.570
It kind of like choke on those words.

00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:19.129
But if we're genuinely humble, those words flow freely,

00:12:19.129 --> 00:12:22.970
and we can make peace with our brother, think about this.

00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:31.169
A proud person finds it difficult to apologize even when he knows he is definitely in the wrong.

00:12:31.529 --> 00:12:41.730
On the other hand, a genuinely humble person can apologize even if he is the one who is not primarily at fault.

00:12:41.730 --> 00:12:45.970
And what is often the quickest shortcut to humility?

00:12:45.970 --> 00:12:48.529
Is it not prayer?

00:12:48.529 --> 00:12:56.129
And this admonition we've discussed, especially, applies to dealing with our mates, if we're married.

00:12:56.129 --> 00:12:59.730
Here's what an elderly man named Jim said.

00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:05.649
He said, I apologize to my wife, even for trivial matters.

00:13:05.649 --> 00:13:10.929
Every since she had a serious operation, she gets distressed easily.

00:13:10.929 --> 00:13:20.129
So I regularly put my arm around her and say, sorry, love, I didn't mean to upset you.

00:13:20.129 --> 00:13:25.450
Like a plant that is watered, she perks up immediately.

00:13:25.450 --> 00:13:27.450
Well, what a fine experience.

00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:31.610
Truly power in this sincere apology.

00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:36.730
In fact, it makes us think this beautiful outcome of Proverbs 1624,

00:13:36.730 --> 00:13:43.289
where it says, pleasant sayings are a honeycomb, like a sweet,

00:13:43.289 --> 00:13:48.730
I should say, sweet to the soul and a healing to the bones.

00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:52.090
So it's like a honeycomb, it's sweet, it's healing,

00:13:52.090 --> 00:13:56.889
and that's certainly true of the case of a sincere apology.

00:13:56.889 --> 00:14:03.929
But now let's get our third potent but precious expression that you want to use generously.

00:14:03.929 --> 00:14:06.090
I love you.

00:14:06.090 --> 00:14:10.009
Now let's talk about this in some lands and in some cultures,

00:14:10.009 --> 00:14:16.250
fathers never ever say to their wife or children that they love them.

00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:18.090
Now that's sad, isn't it?

00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:20.889
And if you think about it, it's unscriptual.

00:14:20.889 --> 00:14:28.169
It is something that the Bible should overrule culture or custom.

00:14:28.169 --> 00:14:31.690
See, and making that expression of endearment.

00:14:31.690 --> 00:14:38.889
Even though we personally may find it difficult or awkward to feel and express affection

00:14:38.889 --> 00:14:42.490
for another one, would you hope us help?

00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:45.929
Whether we're a male or female, we can overcome that problem, we can't wait.

00:14:46.009 --> 00:14:50.809
And we can become imitators of Jehovah and Jesus.

00:14:50.809 --> 00:14:55.049
In fact, the Bible illuminates that Jehovah and Jesus

00:14:55.049 --> 00:14:58.490
certainly share expressions of affection for each other.

00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:02.090
And apparently they've done this for billions of years.

00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:05.210
Open up to Proverbs 8.

00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:10.649
And notice how Jesus describes the loving relationship between himself and his father.

00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:15.690
Proverbs 8, verse number 30, he says,

00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:21.690
Then I was beside him as a master worker.

00:15:21.690 --> 00:15:28.090
I was the one, and notice he was a specially fond of day by day.

00:15:28.090 --> 00:15:34.330
And then it indicate an interchange of expressions of affection.

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:38.250
I was the one he was fond of day by day.

00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:41.850
I rejoiced before him all the time.

00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:48.809
What a fine example of expressing this love between individuals.

00:15:48.809 --> 00:15:52.570
Just one example of Jehovah expressing his love for humans.

00:15:52.570 --> 00:15:56.889
Jehovah said to the Israelites as recorded at Jeremiah 31, verse 3,

00:15:56.889 --> 00:15:58.090
He said,

00:15:58.090 --> 00:16:03.210
I have loved you with an everlasting love.

00:16:03.289 --> 00:16:08.570
That is why I have drawn you to me with loyal love.

00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:11.370
Or think about in the book of John.

00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:15.049
Jesus repeatedly, on the night of his betrayal,

00:16:15.049 --> 00:16:17.370
he expressed his love for his disciples.

00:16:17.370 --> 00:16:20.970
Repeatedly, you can read about it there in the book of John.

00:16:20.970 --> 00:16:25.129
Or think about the conversation that Jesus had with Peter

00:16:25.129 --> 00:16:28.730
as recorded in John 21, 15 through 17.

00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:31.769
Now, it's quite revealing, quite interesting, that conversation.

00:16:31.769 --> 00:16:38.250
Jesus, three times for emphasis, required Peter to express himself

00:16:38.250 --> 00:16:43.529
as to whether Peter loved Jesus and had affection for him.

00:16:43.529 --> 00:16:46.169
Now, the wording of the account is interesting.

00:16:46.169 --> 00:16:51.129
It appears, the way it's worded, that this manly, masculine,

00:16:51.129 --> 00:16:55.529
former fisherman, Peter had some difficulty

00:16:55.529 --> 00:16:59.049
and openly expressing affection for another person,

00:16:59.049 --> 00:17:01.289
even if that other person was Jesus.

00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:06.170
But Jesus basically compelled him to verbalize it, to say it,

00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:09.130
to spit it out, if you will.

00:17:09.130 --> 00:17:13.210
He required him to say it, say, and it was good for Peter.

00:17:13.210 --> 00:17:17.930
You think about it, it was good that Peter articulated those words.

00:17:17.930 --> 00:17:20.730
And you can be sure it made it a lot easier for him later

00:17:20.730 --> 00:17:25.049
to express affection for others.

00:17:25.049 --> 00:17:30.490
Very interestingly, we never want to underestimate the power

00:17:30.569 --> 00:17:33.369
of those words I love you.

00:17:33.369 --> 00:17:37.849
Use them to encourage and endure yourself to your mate,

00:17:37.849 --> 00:17:41.849
to your Bible students, to young ones, your brothers and sisters.

00:17:41.849 --> 00:17:47.049
And of course, make sure that those words are never just merely a platitude

00:17:47.049 --> 00:17:52.009
but a true, genuine expression from what is in your heart,

00:17:52.009 --> 00:17:53.769
appropriately, Peter.

00:17:53.769 --> 00:17:56.410
And of course, this was after that conversation, Jesus had with him,

00:17:56.410 --> 00:18:00.089
we said before, but recorded in the first Peter 122,

00:18:00.170 --> 00:18:01.930
you know what Peter said?

00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:07.130
He said, with unhypocritical, brotherly affection,

00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:11.450
love one another intensely from the heart.

00:18:11.450 --> 00:18:17.529
So use those words, dear ones, to enhance your love for others

00:18:17.529 --> 00:18:20.650
and enhance their love for you.

00:18:20.650 --> 00:18:24.089
Well, there we have three short but precious expressions.

00:18:24.089 --> 00:18:28.329
And as we said, we encourage you to use them generously.

00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:30.329
Well done.

00:18:30.329 --> 00:18:32.250
I'm sorry.

00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:34.089
I love you.

00:18:34.089 --> 00:18:36.890
At appropriate times you may even be able to combine

00:18:36.890 --> 00:18:39.690
expression number three, I love you

00:18:39.690 --> 00:18:45.730
with expression number one or expression number two.

00:18:45.730 --> 00:18:49.849
And if you do that, that will even further intensify

00:18:49.849 --> 00:18:53.809
the impact beneficially of your words.

00:18:53.809 --> 00:18:56.650
But again, think of Proverbs 16, 21,

00:18:56.650 --> 00:18:59.289
the one kind in speech.

00:18:59.289 --> 00:19:04.089
Literally, the one sweet of lips adds persuasion.

00:19:04.089 --> 00:19:07.170
But now this entire Gilead graduation program

00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:11.049
has been prepared with the idea of helping you to become more

00:19:11.049 --> 00:19:15.049
useful to Jehovah and his organization.

00:19:15.049 --> 00:19:18.329
And it'll also help you, if you really pay attention,

00:19:18.329 --> 00:19:22.289
resolve to apply what we have here help you to be happier

00:19:22.289 --> 00:19:25.210
and more effective in your assignments.

00:19:25.210 --> 00:19:27.970
So with this in mind, we're going to give our attention now

00:19:28.049 --> 00:19:30.210
to brother Kent Fisher.

00:19:30.210 --> 00:19:35.569
And he is going to address an interesting,

00:19:35.569 --> 00:19:38.210
very intriguing, in fact, theme.

00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:43.210
His theme, will your tiny stitches strengthen others?

00:19:44.809 --> 00:20:01.529
Brother Fisher, our interest is peaked.

00:20:01.529 --> 00:20:03.849
Well, I wish all of you in the audience

00:20:03.849 --> 00:20:07.009
could see the students sitting here in the front row

00:20:07.009 --> 00:20:09.329
because they're a beautiful sight.

00:20:09.329 --> 00:20:13.690
All dressed in suits, dresses, or garb native

00:20:13.690 --> 00:20:16.450
to the countries that they've come to Gilead from.

00:20:16.450 --> 00:20:19.890
What a good-looking group you are.

00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:21.369
I have a question for you.

00:20:21.369 --> 00:20:24.329
As you were putting on your clothing this morning,

00:20:24.329 --> 00:20:28.450
did you stop and think about how your clothing was made?

00:20:28.450 --> 00:20:30.369
Probably not.

00:20:30.369 --> 00:20:33.450
For most garments, it involves a skilled tailor

00:20:33.450 --> 00:20:36.450
cutting fabric according to a pattern,

00:20:36.490 --> 00:20:39.609
and then sewing those pieces together

00:20:39.609 --> 00:20:43.849
with a machine or by hand, with thousands

00:20:43.849 --> 00:20:46.690
and thousands of tiny stitches.

00:20:47.970 --> 00:20:50.450
And if that tailor did his work well,

00:20:50.450 --> 00:20:53.490
this seam will now be as strong or stronger

00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:55.329
than the material itself.

00:20:55.329 --> 00:20:58.410
And the tiny stitches, almost invisible.

00:20:58.410 --> 00:20:59.650
You'll never notice them.

00:21:00.890 --> 00:21:04.569
Did you know that now you have an increased opportunity

00:21:04.569 --> 00:21:06.970
to do a very similar work?

00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:09.650
Turn with me, please, to Philippians chapter two.

00:21:10.650 --> 00:21:24.250
And let's read verses three and four.

00:21:24.250 --> 00:21:26.930
Starting partway through verse three, it says,

00:21:26.930 --> 00:21:31.130
but with humility, consider others superior to you,

00:21:31.130 --> 00:21:34.609
as you look out not only for your own interests,

00:21:34.609 --> 00:21:36.529
but also for the interests of others.

00:21:38.009 --> 00:21:41.410
Simply put, these verses are about being unselfish,

00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:44.450
about discerning what others need

00:21:44.450 --> 00:21:48.170
and then filling that need ahead of your own.

00:21:48.170 --> 00:21:50.970
And you know that's exactly what each of you

00:21:50.970 --> 00:21:53.089
has been doing in life up to this point.

00:21:54.009 --> 00:21:58.410
And you are wonderful spiritual men and women.

00:21:58.410 --> 00:22:01.369
It's been a delight for those of us here at Patterson

00:22:01.369 --> 00:22:03.450
to have you with us for the last months

00:22:03.450 --> 00:22:04.970
while you've been in school.

00:22:06.089 --> 00:22:08.650
But you know now as you return to your assignments

00:22:08.650 --> 00:22:11.690
or you take on new responsibilities,

00:22:11.690 --> 00:22:14.690
you're taking with you the effect of your Gilead training.

00:22:15.609 --> 00:22:17.450
How often in your Gilead classes

00:22:17.450 --> 00:22:22.250
did you extract scriptural principles from accounts

00:22:22.250 --> 00:22:25.369
and then talk about a practical application

00:22:25.369 --> 00:22:27.369
of those principles?

00:22:27.369 --> 00:22:32.250
Those principles are now like a spool of spiritual thread

00:22:32.250 --> 00:22:35.410
that you can use to strengthen your brothers and sisters.

00:22:37.130 --> 00:22:40.089
At times the needs of others may seem very small

00:22:40.089 --> 00:22:44.930
or insignificant or even something they should just get over.

00:22:46.210 --> 00:22:49.170
Yet when you unselfishly stop what you're doing

00:22:49.170 --> 00:22:51.210
and fill those needs,

00:22:51.210 --> 00:22:56.130
it will be like putting tiny stitches in the seam of a garment.

00:22:56.130 --> 00:22:59.210
Those you help will be stronger and in turn,

00:22:59.210 --> 00:23:02.529
they will use that strength to help others

00:23:02.529 --> 00:23:04.089
in Jehovah's organization.

00:23:05.049 --> 00:23:07.410
Often of course the stitches we put in

00:23:07.410 --> 00:23:10.849
to strengthen others are made with our tongue.

00:23:10.849 --> 00:23:13.450
And like a sewing needle, our tongue is very sharp.

00:23:14.569 --> 00:23:16.690
Proverbs 12, 18 says,

00:23:16.690 --> 00:23:19.089
thoughtless speech is like the stabs of a sword

00:23:19.089 --> 00:23:21.890
but the tongue of the wise ones is a healing.

00:23:21.890 --> 00:23:26.130
And I think you would all agree that while we have healed

00:23:26.130 --> 00:23:27.849
people with our tongue at times,

00:23:27.849 --> 00:23:30.210
we've also done a little bit of stabbing

00:23:30.210 --> 00:23:32.730
along the way as well and a thoughtless way.

00:23:33.650 --> 00:23:35.569
Now you're going to see that as you gain

00:23:35.569 --> 00:23:37.130
more responsibility,

00:23:38.690 --> 00:23:42.529
the words you say will have even greater impact

00:23:42.529 --> 00:23:43.890
than they have in the past.

00:23:44.769 --> 00:23:45.849
So the question is,

00:23:45.849 --> 00:23:50.369
our theme, will your tiny stitches strengthen others?

00:23:51.289 --> 00:23:53.450
We're going to discuss four scriptures

00:23:53.450 --> 00:23:56.809
that highlight ways you can put in stitches

00:23:56.809 --> 00:23:58.289
that will strengthen others.

00:23:59.569 --> 00:24:02.130
The first example is found in Jesus' illustration

00:24:02.130 --> 00:24:02.970
of the talents.

00:24:02.970 --> 00:24:04.609
That's found in Matthew 25,

00:24:04.609 --> 00:24:06.490
but you'll remember it,

00:24:06.490 --> 00:24:10.809
as the master returns and reviews the work of his slaves,

00:24:10.809 --> 00:24:13.849
he uses the exact same wording for two of his slaves.

00:24:13.849 --> 00:24:15.049
He says,

00:24:15.049 --> 00:24:18.329
well done, good and faithful slave.

00:24:18.329 --> 00:24:20.690
Enter into the joy of your master.

00:24:21.529 --> 00:24:24.730
Well, as we heard highlighted already by our chairman,

00:24:24.730 --> 00:24:27.170
commendation is powerful,

00:24:28.250 --> 00:24:30.970
but it's not automatically strengthening.

00:24:30.970 --> 00:24:32.529
Have you ever had the circumstances

00:24:32.529 --> 00:24:33.650
where you are busy working

00:24:33.690 --> 00:24:35.809
and someone walks by and says,

00:24:35.809 --> 00:24:37.369
keep up your good work.

00:24:37.369 --> 00:24:39.170
And you're thinking to yourself,

00:24:39.170 --> 00:24:41.289
do they even know what work I do?

00:24:42.970 --> 00:24:45.609
For commendation to be strengthening,

00:24:45.609 --> 00:24:48.730
it must be sincere, it must be specific.

00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:52.529
The publication, keep yourself in God's love,

00:24:52.529 --> 00:24:53.930
expressed it this way.

00:24:54.970 --> 00:24:57.930
A sincere word of commendation lets you know

00:24:57.930 --> 00:25:00.250
that someone notices you,

00:25:00.250 --> 00:25:03.210
that someone cares about you,

00:25:03.210 --> 00:25:06.809
and that what you did was well worth the effort involved.

00:25:06.809 --> 00:25:09.170
Such reassurance builds your confidence

00:25:09.170 --> 00:25:13.289
and motivates you to work even more diligently in the future.

00:25:14.490 --> 00:25:16.289
What's that telling us?

00:25:16.289 --> 00:25:19.809
That every time you sincerely commend someone

00:25:19.809 --> 00:25:21.250
for what they're doing,

00:25:21.250 --> 00:25:25.130
you're putting in tiny stitches that strengthens them.

00:25:25.130 --> 00:25:26.490
Example number two.

00:25:27.410 --> 00:25:29.089
Proverbs 12-25 says,

00:25:29.089 --> 00:25:32.930
anxiety in a man's heart weighs it down,

00:25:32.970 --> 00:25:34.690
but a good word cheers it up.

00:25:35.769 --> 00:25:39.849
Well, those who are anxious or discouraged

00:25:39.849 --> 00:25:42.049
need encouragement.

00:25:42.049 --> 00:25:45.769
They need to know that you see what they're dealing with,

00:25:45.769 --> 00:25:49.529
that you care about them and that you want to help.

00:25:49.529 --> 00:25:51.369
As the watch star once put it,

00:25:51.369 --> 00:25:53.049
at this point in the race for life,

00:25:53.049 --> 00:25:55.569
our brothers need not critics,

00:25:55.569 --> 00:25:59.609
but friends to cheer them on to victory, well said.

00:25:59.609 --> 00:26:02.170
Each and every time you use the principles

00:26:02.170 --> 00:26:04.529
you have learned from God's word,

00:26:04.529 --> 00:26:08.609
to encourage someone to cheer up their heart that's weighed down,

00:26:09.650 --> 00:26:12.730
you're putting in tiny stitches that make them stronger.

00:26:13.849 --> 00:26:14.930
Example three.

00:26:16.289 --> 00:26:18.569
Galatians 6-1 says in part,

00:26:18.569 --> 00:26:21.809
if a man takes a false step before he's aware of it,

00:26:21.809 --> 00:26:24.769
try to readjust him in a spirit of mildness.

00:26:25.809 --> 00:26:30.130
You know, counsel can be embarrassing.

00:26:30.170 --> 00:26:31.849
It can be embarrassing to receive,

00:26:31.849 --> 00:26:36.250
but frankly, it can also be embarrassing to give to others.

00:26:36.250 --> 00:26:40.130
And at times, it's unnecessarily embarrassing

00:26:40.130 --> 00:26:43.569
because the one who gives the counsel waited far too long

00:26:43.569 --> 00:26:44.569
to speak up.

00:26:45.890 --> 00:26:50.450
Why not make it your aim to give lots and lots

00:26:50.450 --> 00:26:53.210
of tiny reminders?

00:26:53.210 --> 00:26:55.049
In English, there's a saying,

00:26:55.049 --> 00:26:57.930
a stitch in time saves time.

00:26:57.930 --> 00:26:59.650
What does that mean?

00:26:59.690 --> 00:27:03.490
It means that when a small mistake is corrected,

00:27:03.490 --> 00:27:05.170
that it never gets larger,

00:27:05.170 --> 00:27:08.250
and it never requires all the time and effort

00:27:08.250 --> 00:27:10.569
to correct it that it would have taken

00:27:10.569 --> 00:27:12.210
if it had gotten larger.

00:27:13.009 --> 00:27:16.289
When you give others reminders in a spirit of mildness,

00:27:16.289 --> 00:27:20.210
and they sense that you genuinely care about them,

00:27:20.210 --> 00:27:23.529
you put in stitches that will strengthen them greatly.

00:27:24.569 --> 00:27:25.970
Example number four.

00:27:26.970 --> 00:27:30.250
After the faithful man Job was approved for his wrong viewpoint,

00:27:30.250 --> 00:27:32.490
he says, I make a retraction,

00:27:32.490 --> 00:27:36.690
and I do repent in dust and ashes.

00:27:36.690 --> 00:27:38.730
Well, his brother let emphasized,

00:27:38.730 --> 00:27:42.289
an apology is a powerful thing.

00:27:43.410 --> 00:27:47.049
But how is it also strengthening to others?

00:27:47.049 --> 00:27:48.049
Let's illustrate.

00:27:49.130 --> 00:27:51.529
A circuit overseer made a mistake

00:27:51.529 --> 00:27:54.529
while he was presiding over a large audience

00:27:54.569 --> 00:27:56.130
filled with elders.

00:27:56.130 --> 00:27:58.930
When the mistake was pointed out, what did he do?

00:27:58.930 --> 00:28:02.250
He acknowledged the mistake, he corrected it,

00:28:02.250 --> 00:28:05.369
and he sincerely apologized to the brothers.

00:28:05.369 --> 00:28:06.930
Well, what was the result of that?

00:28:06.930 --> 00:28:09.250
Did they all lose their respect for the brother?

00:28:09.250 --> 00:28:12.049
Did they suggest that maybe he wasn't qualified

00:28:12.049 --> 00:28:13.769
for his assignment anymore?

00:28:13.769 --> 00:28:15.210
Not at all.

00:28:15.210 --> 00:28:17.369
One brother who was there said,

00:28:17.369 --> 00:28:19.450
when I saw him admit his mistake

00:28:19.450 --> 00:28:23.130
in front of all those elders, it impressed me greatly.

00:28:23.130 --> 00:28:26.930
I respected him a lot more after that apology.

00:28:26.930 --> 00:28:29.490
His example taught me how important it is

00:28:29.490 --> 00:28:31.849
to recognize my own shortcomings.

00:28:32.930 --> 00:28:35.369
So if it will be your pattern

00:28:35.369 --> 00:28:38.490
to humbly admit your mistakes and apologize,

00:28:38.490 --> 00:28:40.569
others will respect you more,

00:28:40.569 --> 00:28:43.009
but it will also build their respect

00:28:43.009 --> 00:28:45.250
and love for Jehovah's organization.

00:28:46.410 --> 00:28:48.250
These may not seem like big things

00:28:48.250 --> 00:28:51.089
in some ways they're not, to command,

00:28:51.089 --> 00:28:56.089
to encourage, to give loving reminders or to apologize.

00:28:56.410 --> 00:28:59.250
However, please never underestimate

00:28:59.250 --> 00:29:03.890
the strengthening effect of every little tiny stitch

00:29:03.890 --> 00:29:06.450
that you put in to strengthen your brothers.

00:29:06.450 --> 00:29:08.650
And brothers, especially for you,

00:29:09.650 --> 00:29:13.890
never forget the value of the freeness of speech

00:29:13.890 --> 00:29:15.849
that so doing will bring to you

00:29:15.849 --> 00:29:18.569
when you have to handle weighty matters

00:29:18.569 --> 00:29:22.970
or give counsel to individuals or to large audiences.

00:29:22.970 --> 00:29:26.609
No fair warning, as you make thousands

00:29:26.609 --> 00:29:29.130
of tiny stitches to strengthen others,

00:29:29.130 --> 00:29:32.650
unselfishly applying what Philippians chapter two said,

00:29:33.730 --> 00:29:35.809
your work's not always going to be seen.

00:29:35.809 --> 00:29:37.130
It may be invisible.

00:29:37.130 --> 00:29:40.849
In fact, those you strengthen may not even remember

00:29:40.849 --> 00:29:44.490
that you did so, and that's okay,

00:29:44.490 --> 00:29:46.849
because Jehovah knows.

00:29:46.849 --> 00:29:51.490
Jehovah sees everything you say and everything you do

00:29:51.490 --> 00:29:54.329
to strengthen your brothers and sisters around you.

00:29:54.329 --> 00:29:56.849
And when he looks at his organization,

00:29:56.849 --> 00:29:59.289
he will know that it is stronger,

00:29:59.289 --> 00:30:03.609
that it is more united, that it is increasingly beautiful

00:30:03.609 --> 00:30:07.970
in part at least to the thousands of tiny stitches

00:30:07.970 --> 00:30:23.180
that you have made.

00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:25.819
Well, it's obvious the students really appreciated

00:30:25.819 --> 00:30:28.660
that practical advice.

00:30:29.619 --> 00:30:31.220
Well, now we're going to turn our attention

00:30:31.220 --> 00:30:34.660
to Brother Jeffrey Jackson of the governing body.

00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:37.380
And here's an interesting theme,

00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:42.380
are you avoiding spiritual short-sightedness?

00:30:42.980 --> 00:30:45.819
So, Brother Jackson, we're looking forward very much

00:30:45.819 --> 00:30:48.420
to seeing how you develop this theme.

00:30:52.130 --> 00:30:54.609
Do you suffer from myopia?

00:30:55.730 --> 00:30:59.369
Well, some research tells us that in certain countries,

00:30:59.369 --> 00:31:03.730
30 to 40% of the population suffer from this.

00:31:03.730 --> 00:31:04.730
What is it?

00:31:04.730 --> 00:31:07.569
Short-sightedness or near-sightedness.

00:31:07.569 --> 00:31:10.930
In other words, a person can see very clearly

00:31:10.930 --> 00:31:13.369
what is just around them,

00:31:13.369 --> 00:31:16.329
but it's very difficult for them to see clearly

00:31:16.329 --> 00:31:18.369
what is far away.

00:31:18.369 --> 00:31:20.809
And of course, that problem can be helped

00:31:20.809 --> 00:31:23.609
by having eyeglasses like I have.

00:31:25.289 --> 00:31:28.529
We also know that in a idiomatic way,

00:31:28.529 --> 00:31:32.609
this expression can refer to someone who is so focused

00:31:32.609 --> 00:31:36.609
on just one thing that they miss the whole big picture.

00:31:37.609 --> 00:31:40.009
And in English, we have an expression,

00:31:40.009 --> 00:31:43.970
the person can't see the forest for the trees.

00:31:43.970 --> 00:31:46.490
So they can see each tree,

00:31:46.490 --> 00:31:49.569
but they don't step back and look at the whole picture

00:31:49.569 --> 00:31:51.089
and see the forest.

00:31:52.049 --> 00:31:56.369
Could something like that happen to us spiritually speaking?

00:31:56.369 --> 00:31:57.369
Yes, it could.

00:31:57.410 --> 00:31:59.650
The Apostle Peter reminds us about this.

00:31:59.650 --> 00:32:03.650
If you turn with me to the book of 2 Peter chapter one,

00:32:04.690 --> 00:32:08.289
if we look at verse five and read on from there,

00:32:08.289 --> 00:32:11.890
we'll notice how the Apostle Peter under inspiration

00:32:11.890 --> 00:32:16.289
helps us to avoid spiritual short-sightedness.

00:32:16.289 --> 00:32:19.289
And verse five, he starts off by saying

00:32:19.289 --> 00:32:21.250
that with every earnest effort,

00:32:21.250 --> 00:32:23.930
we should develop certain qualities.

00:32:23.930 --> 00:32:27.329
And you notice some of them there, self-control, faith,

00:32:27.329 --> 00:32:31.569
endurance, godly devotion, and in verse eight,

00:32:31.569 --> 00:32:35.089
notice he says, but if these things exist

00:32:35.089 --> 00:32:37.769
in you and over flow, they will prevent you

00:32:37.769 --> 00:32:41.089
from being either inactive or unfruitful.

00:32:41.089 --> 00:32:43.410
Now you dear students, soon to be graduates

00:32:43.410 --> 00:32:46.089
of the 140th class of Gilead.

00:32:46.089 --> 00:32:48.289
We know this is exactly what you've been doing

00:32:48.289 --> 00:32:52.329
the last few months, building up your spirituality,

00:32:52.329 --> 00:32:55.970
trying to develop these qualities that the Apostle Peter

00:32:55.970 --> 00:32:59.529
has told us about, and we commend you for that.

00:32:59.529 --> 00:33:03.809
It's interesting that in verses five through eight,

00:33:03.809 --> 00:33:07.730
the Apostle Peter uses the pronoun you, you, you,

00:33:07.730 --> 00:33:10.809
as if he's speaking to us individually.

00:33:10.809 --> 00:33:13.049
But in verse nine, he changes the pronoun

00:33:13.049 --> 00:33:16.650
and starts talking about a third person, he.

00:33:16.650 --> 00:33:20.009
Let's see what he says there in the beginning of verse nine.

00:33:21.089 --> 00:33:23.529
For anyone lacking these things,

00:33:23.529 --> 00:33:26.650
so that is the spiritual qualities,

00:33:26.650 --> 00:33:29.250
the spirituality involved with them,

00:33:29.250 --> 00:33:31.730
that person is blind,

00:33:31.730 --> 00:33:34.410
shutting his eyes to the light.

00:33:34.410 --> 00:33:36.250
And if you look down to the footnote,

00:33:36.250 --> 00:33:40.769
what do you see it says, blind, short, sighted.

00:33:40.769 --> 00:33:43.170
And interestingly, the Greek word used here

00:33:43.170 --> 00:33:45.930
is the basis for the English word, myopia.

00:33:46.970 --> 00:33:49.650
So when we think about this, the new old translation

00:33:49.650 --> 00:33:52.529
translates this expression very nicely,

00:33:52.569 --> 00:33:56.690
very accurately, because it indicates an action

00:33:56.690 --> 00:33:58.809
on the part of the person.

00:33:58.809 --> 00:34:01.970
To illustrate this, imagine you're driving

00:34:01.970 --> 00:34:06.329
late in the afternoon towards the sun that is setting.

00:34:06.329 --> 00:34:10.170
The sun is shining so strongly in your eyes,

00:34:10.170 --> 00:34:11.489
what do you tend to do?

00:34:11.489 --> 00:34:14.769
You squint, your eyes close.

00:34:14.769 --> 00:34:16.369
Then what happens, what's the danger?

00:34:16.369 --> 00:34:19.530
You only see what's just there in front of you

00:34:19.530 --> 00:34:23.289
and you can't really see too far ahead.

00:34:23.289 --> 00:34:24.650
Well, spiritually speaking,

00:34:24.650 --> 00:34:28.130
this is what the Apostle Peter is warning us about.

00:34:28.130 --> 00:34:30.130
We never want short sightedness,

00:34:30.130 --> 00:34:33.929
just looking at the physical things around us

00:34:33.929 --> 00:34:36.489
and forgetting the bigger picture,

00:34:36.489 --> 00:34:40.050
the spiritual picture that involves our relationship

00:34:40.050 --> 00:34:41.690
with Jehovah God.

00:34:41.690 --> 00:34:43.090
Now let's use two examples,

00:34:43.090 --> 00:34:45.610
they're contrasting examples,

00:34:45.610 --> 00:34:47.809
to show us how dangerous this is

00:34:47.809 --> 00:34:49.610
and what it really means.

00:34:49.610 --> 00:34:52.849
Turn with me, please, to first Samuel chapter four.

00:34:53.849 --> 00:34:57.610
And here we have the negative example,

00:34:57.610 --> 00:34:59.809
first Samuel chapter four.

00:34:59.809 --> 00:35:02.650
It refers here to the Israelites

00:35:02.650 --> 00:35:05.530
in the days of high priest Eli

00:35:05.530 --> 00:35:09.289
and at that time, they were fighting the Philistines

00:35:09.289 --> 00:35:13.530
and they just had been beaten, defeated.

00:35:13.530 --> 00:35:14.849
Now what happened, well,

00:35:14.849 --> 00:35:16.610
first Samuel chapter four verse three,

00:35:16.610 --> 00:35:18.050
notice their reaction.

00:35:19.210 --> 00:35:21.530
When the people returned to the camp,

00:35:21.530 --> 00:35:23.929
the elders of Israel said,

00:35:23.929 --> 00:35:26.969
why did Jehovah allow us to be defeated today

00:35:26.969 --> 00:35:28.449
by the Philistines?

00:35:28.449 --> 00:35:29.769
Now that's a very good question.

00:35:29.769 --> 00:35:32.889
I'm sure each one of us would have asked that same question

00:35:32.889 --> 00:35:34.449
if we were there at that time.

00:35:35.409 --> 00:35:38.369
It's a good question because it highlighted

00:35:38.369 --> 00:35:40.769
the relationship with Jehovah.

00:35:40.769 --> 00:35:44.050
But now did they analyze the relationship with Jehovah

00:35:45.010 --> 00:35:47.690
and see was Jehovah angry with them or not?

00:35:47.690 --> 00:35:50.050
Well, notice what they did, let's read on.

00:35:50.050 --> 00:35:53.329
They say, let us take the ark of Jehovah's covenant

00:35:53.329 --> 00:35:56.889
with us from Shiloh so that it may be with us

00:35:56.889 --> 00:36:00.289
and save us from the hand of our enemies.

00:36:00.289 --> 00:36:02.289
What had happened, short-sightedness,

00:36:02.289 --> 00:36:03.969
they were looking for something physical

00:36:03.969 --> 00:36:06.730
that was just there close on the ark of the covenant.

00:36:06.730 --> 00:36:08.329
If we have the ark,

00:36:08.329 --> 00:36:12.010
Jehovah will have to bless us wrong.

00:36:12.969 --> 00:36:14.369
We know what happened.

00:36:14.369 --> 00:36:15.809
They were defeated again

00:36:15.809 --> 00:36:20.050
and they actually lost physically the ark of the covenant.

00:36:20.050 --> 00:36:21.889
What should they have done?

00:36:21.889 --> 00:36:24.250
Analyze their relationship with Jehovah,

00:36:24.250 --> 00:36:27.210
that spiritual element, the bigger picture.

00:36:28.050 --> 00:36:30.010
Now let's look at a good example

00:36:30.010 --> 00:36:33.449
in the book of a second Samuel chapter 15.

00:36:34.289 --> 00:36:36.530
And this tells us about King David.

00:36:37.730 --> 00:36:41.170
At this time, David was dealing with a very difficult problem.

00:36:41.210 --> 00:36:44.650
His son Absalom had rebelled against him.

00:36:44.650 --> 00:36:47.010
David was fleeing the city of Jerusalem

00:36:47.010 --> 00:36:50.250
along with his followers and supporters.

00:36:50.250 --> 00:36:52.610
He was standing in the valley of Kidron

00:36:52.610 --> 00:36:54.730
just at the side there of Jerusalem

00:36:54.730 --> 00:36:57.090
and the people were passing across.

00:36:57.090 --> 00:36:58.730
And do you know what happened next?

00:36:58.730 --> 00:37:00.969
Zadok came down with what?

00:37:00.969 --> 00:37:02.969
The ark of the covenant.

00:37:03.809 --> 00:37:05.369
Now how did David react?

00:37:05.369 --> 00:37:09.130
Well, let's have a look at verse 25 and 26.

00:37:10.130 --> 00:37:12.730
But the king said to Zadok,

00:37:12.730 --> 00:37:16.010
take the ark of the true God back to the city.

00:37:17.010 --> 00:37:20.130
If I find favor in the eyes of Jehovah,

00:37:20.130 --> 00:37:23.050
he will also bring me back and let me see it

00:37:23.050 --> 00:37:24.650
and it's dwelling place.

00:37:24.650 --> 00:37:26.050
But if he should say,

00:37:26.050 --> 00:37:28.570
I have found no pleasure in you,

00:37:28.570 --> 00:37:33.449
then let him do to me whatever seems good in his eyes.

00:37:33.449 --> 00:37:35.409
What a different viewpoint.

00:37:35.409 --> 00:37:37.610
You see, David realized

00:37:37.690 --> 00:37:41.289
whether the ark was with him or not physically,

00:37:41.289 --> 00:37:43.289
it didn't really make any difference.

00:37:43.289 --> 00:37:44.130
Why?

00:37:44.130 --> 00:37:49.130
The important thing was his relationship with Jehovah God.

00:37:49.130 --> 00:37:52.530
What a beautiful example of someone who could see

00:37:52.530 --> 00:37:55.809
beyond what was just there physically in front of him

00:37:55.809 --> 00:37:58.730
and emphasized his relationship with Jehovah.

00:37:59.730 --> 00:38:02.289
Now, you dear students, soon to be graduates.

00:38:02.289 --> 00:38:04.170
How can that apply to you?

00:38:04.170 --> 00:38:05.730
Well, while you've been here at Gilead,

00:38:05.730 --> 00:38:08.130
you've been building up your spirituality.

00:38:08.130 --> 00:38:10.409
Now, Dad, you've been thinking very seriously

00:38:10.409 --> 00:38:13.170
about your relationship with Jehovah.

00:38:13.170 --> 00:38:16.969
And now, as you go back to your assignments,

00:38:16.969 --> 00:38:19.170
what do you need to do?

00:38:19.170 --> 00:38:22.690
Not think, well, I was trained at Gilead.

00:38:24.050 --> 00:38:26.809
I'm an elder, I'm a better light.

00:38:26.809 --> 00:38:29.570
I'm a missionary, I'm a traveling officer.

00:38:29.570 --> 00:38:31.130
I must be okay.

00:38:32.130 --> 00:38:35.489
Uh-uh, that sounds like you're taking hold

00:38:35.489 --> 00:38:37.329
of the ark of the covenant, saying,

00:38:37.329 --> 00:38:41.289
Ah, I can rely on this physical thing.

00:38:41.289 --> 00:38:45.690
No, let's be like King David, who realized,

00:38:45.690 --> 00:38:47.849
no matter what service privilege we have,

00:38:47.849 --> 00:38:51.530
whatever assignment we have, that in itself

00:38:51.530 --> 00:38:55.369
doesn't prove that our relationship with Jehovah is good.

00:38:55.369 --> 00:38:58.250
Remember the Apostle Peter helped us to see

00:38:58.289 --> 00:39:01.610
it's the spirituality that we gain

00:39:01.610 --> 00:39:05.289
from putting on the spiritual glasses, we might say.

00:39:05.289 --> 00:39:06.329
How do we do that?

00:39:06.329 --> 00:39:10.210
Reading God's Word, the Bible daily, meditating on it,

00:39:10.210 --> 00:39:12.449
thinking carefully about it,

00:39:12.449 --> 00:39:16.610
and then praying to our loving Heavenly Father, Jehovah.

00:39:16.610 --> 00:39:21.610
So doing that, it's as if we overcome this short-sightedness.

00:39:21.610 --> 00:39:24.809
We're not just thinking of what we see around us,

00:39:24.809 --> 00:39:27.849
but we see the whole picture, the big picture,

00:39:27.849 --> 00:39:30.289
the picture that involves our relationship

00:39:30.289 --> 00:39:31.730
with Jehovah God.

00:39:31.730 --> 00:39:35.610
So you dear students of the 140th class.

00:39:35.610 --> 00:39:38.449
As brother let's us, we love you.

00:39:39.489 --> 00:39:42.050
We know that you're a special group of persons

00:39:42.050 --> 00:39:44.369
and we know that Jehovah loves you.

00:39:44.369 --> 00:39:46.849
So wherever you go, whatever you do,

00:39:46.849 --> 00:39:51.010
whatever problems you face, remember your relationship

00:39:51.010 --> 00:39:54.289
with Jehovah, treasure your spirituality,

00:39:54.329 --> 00:40:10.590
and in that way you will avoid spiritual short-sightedness.

00:40:10.590 --> 00:40:12.869
Oh, we certainly appreciate your good work

00:40:12.869 --> 00:40:16.110
as a spiritual optometrist, brother Jackson.

00:40:17.949 --> 00:40:19.349
We needed that.

00:40:20.429 --> 00:40:23.030
But now we have brother David Schaefer,

00:40:23.030 --> 00:40:27.110
who serves as a helper to the teaching committee,

00:40:27.110 --> 00:40:30.670
and he has also a very interesting theme.

00:40:30.670 --> 00:40:32.309
What do you want?

00:40:32.309 --> 00:40:34.230
Now I've been asked that question many times,

00:40:34.230 --> 00:40:37.309
but I've never heard a talk on that subject.

00:40:37.309 --> 00:40:42.460
Brother Schaefer, please.

00:40:42.460 --> 00:40:46.340
What is your heart's desire?

00:40:47.539 --> 00:40:48.739
Does it matter?

00:40:50.019 --> 00:40:53.219
When you dedicated your life to Jehovah,

00:40:53.219 --> 00:40:56.340
you didn't lose your free will.

00:40:56.340 --> 00:40:59.659
Ecclesiastes 11.9 encourages young ones,

00:40:59.659 --> 00:41:01.579
follow the ways of your heart

00:41:01.579 --> 00:41:05.099
and go where your eyes lead you,

00:41:05.099 --> 00:41:09.860
an acknowledgement that wishes, dreams, goals

00:41:09.860 --> 00:41:13.820
are not necessarily bad.

00:41:13.820 --> 00:41:18.179
At the same time, that verse ends with a condition.

00:41:18.179 --> 00:41:22.380
But know that the true God will bring you

00:41:22.380 --> 00:41:24.500
into judgment for all these things.

00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:27.820
So while we enjoy the freedom to make decisions,

00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:32.820
we recognize that our choices matter to Jehovah.

00:41:33.059 --> 00:41:36.059
What do you want?

00:41:38.059 --> 00:41:40.739
Each time that question appears in the Bible,

00:41:40.739 --> 00:41:44.539
it reveals something about the motives

00:41:44.539 --> 00:41:47.139
of the person who answers the question.

00:41:48.340 --> 00:41:51.980
Sometimes it reveals a beautiful condition of the heart.

00:41:52.940 --> 00:41:55.019
At other times, it reveals that a person

00:41:55.019 --> 00:41:58.780
is more interested in his preferences than in truth.

00:41:59.780 --> 00:42:01.300
And at still other times,

00:42:01.300 --> 00:42:06.019
it reveals that the person has no idea what they wanted.

00:42:06.019 --> 00:42:08.820
That was the case with the daughter of Herodius,

00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:10.820
who danced at Herod's birthday party

00:42:10.820 --> 00:42:14.340
and pleased him so much that he asked her,

00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:18.139
according to Mark chapter 6, verse 22,

00:42:18.139 --> 00:42:21.380
ask me whatever you want.

00:42:21.380 --> 00:42:24.980
And I will give it to you up to half my kingdom,

00:42:24.980 --> 00:42:29.980
her indecision left her susceptible to evil influence.

00:42:31.460 --> 00:42:34.619
But recall a very different answer to this question

00:42:34.619 --> 00:42:37.420
found at 1 Kings chapter 3,

00:42:37.420 --> 00:42:39.539
the start of Solomon's kingship.

00:42:39.539 --> 00:42:41.500
Jehovah appeared to him in a dream

00:42:41.500 --> 00:42:43.300
and said in verse 5,

00:42:43.300 --> 00:42:45.860
ask what you would like me to give you.

00:42:46.820 --> 00:42:50.260
Happy that Solomon chose wisdom

00:42:50.260 --> 00:42:52.780
instead of riches and glory,

00:42:52.780 --> 00:42:58.480
Jehovah gave him all three.

00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:02.880
If only Solomon had continued to want

00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:05.079
an obedient heart.

00:43:05.079 --> 00:43:08.880
Then at 2 Kings chapter 2 and verse 9,

00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:11.119
the same question is posed again,

00:43:11.119 --> 00:43:16.119
Elijah to Elijah, ask what you want me to do for you.

00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:17.880
Like Solomon,

00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:21.639
Elijah asked for something that would help him

00:43:21.639 --> 00:43:24.920
in his service to Jehovah.

00:43:24.920 --> 00:43:29.920
He asked for an identity as Elijah's successor, his heir.

00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:33.559
He asked for the same courageous spirit

00:43:33.559 --> 00:43:37.880
and Jehovah granted that request.

00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:39.239
Well, like Elijah,

00:43:39.239 --> 00:43:41.679
you two are facing a new assignment.

00:43:41.679 --> 00:43:43.679
Maybe it's all together new,

00:43:43.679 --> 00:43:45.920
that maybe it's back to where you were before,

00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:50.480
but with a new focus with more responsibility.

00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:54.440
Will you feel overwhelmed, inadequate?

00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:56.239
One brother recommended for Gilead recently

00:43:56.239 --> 00:43:59.440
was described as studious, modest and humble

00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:00.440
before he came.

00:44:00.440 --> 00:44:01.679
But after his return,

00:44:01.679 --> 00:44:04.360
he was reported on as more mature,

00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:08.400
more aware of the needs of others, more capable.

00:44:09.519 --> 00:44:11.800
Another recent graduate who had been serving

00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:15.400
on a Bethel department as the overseer for years

00:44:15.400 --> 00:44:19.519
before coming to Gilead returned a different person,

00:44:19.519 --> 00:44:24.119
a kinder overseer, a better shepherd.

00:44:24.119 --> 00:44:26.679
Well, just as Jehovah strengthened Elijah

00:44:26.679 --> 00:44:28.960
with identity, with courage.

00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:33.440
So he strengthened these students, graduates,

00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:35.159
and their wives.

00:44:35.159 --> 00:44:40.159
And so he will strengthen you if that is what you want.

00:44:43.079 --> 00:44:45.079
What do you want?

00:44:45.079 --> 00:44:47.760
Turn with me please to John chapter 16.

00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:50.840
Let's move forward in time from Elijah's day

00:44:50.840 --> 00:44:54.559
to nice and 1433 CE.

00:44:54.559 --> 00:44:57.400
Jesus final night with his disciples.

00:44:57.440 --> 00:45:01.280
He says in John chapter 16, verse 24,

00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:04.920
until now you have not asked for a single thing

00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:07.519
in my name, ask,

00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:13.480
and you will receive so that your joy may be complete.

00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:19.800
Now that marked a turning point in the history

00:45:20.239 --> 00:45:22.039
of prayer.

00:45:22.039 --> 00:45:26.639
From 1513 BCE, if a person wanted Jehovah God

00:45:27.480 --> 00:45:29.960
to hear his prayers, he had to recognize

00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:32.840
that Israel was Jehovah's chosen nation.

00:45:32.840 --> 00:45:36.599
From 1026 BCE, a person had to recognize

00:45:36.599 --> 00:45:40.079
that the temple was Jehovah's arrangement

00:45:40.079 --> 00:45:42.239
for accepting sacrifice.

00:45:42.239 --> 00:45:46.440
But now the situation had changed.

00:45:46.440 --> 00:45:48.880
That situation, that system was temporary.

00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:51.519
But now the shadow was about to give way to the reality.

00:45:51.519 --> 00:45:54.320
From henceforth, a person's relationship with Jehovah

00:45:54.320 --> 00:45:57.679
would be founded on obedience to Jesus Christ.

00:45:57.679 --> 00:46:00.639
After Jesus said that to his disciples,

00:46:00.639 --> 00:46:02.760
did their minds go back to the events

00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:05.960
that took place just a few days earlier,

00:46:05.960 --> 00:46:08.119
recorded in Mark chapter 10?

00:46:08.119 --> 00:46:09.639
Let's turn there together.

00:46:09.639 --> 00:46:11.880
Mark chapter 10.

00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:15.960
Jesus poses the same question two more times.

00:46:15.960 --> 00:46:20.960
First, beginning in verse 35, James and John,

00:46:21.239 --> 00:46:23.039
the sons of Zebedee approached him

00:46:23.079 --> 00:46:27.800
and said to him, teacher, we want you to do for us

00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:29.760
what we ask of you.

00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:33.639
He said to them, what do you want me to do for you?

00:46:33.639 --> 00:46:38.639
They replied, grant us to sit down one at your right hand

00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:47.349
and one at your left in your glory, glory.

00:46:47.630 --> 00:46:50.710
Now, that was what they wanted.

00:46:50.710 --> 00:46:53.710
The request was selfish, but it did happen

00:46:53.710 --> 00:46:58.710
to reveal faith in the reality of the kingdom.

00:46:58.989 --> 00:47:01.389
But what they wanted almost caused them

00:47:01.389 --> 00:47:05.989
to lose sight of Jehovah's purpose and their role

00:47:05.989 --> 00:47:07.110
in connection with it.

00:47:07.110 --> 00:47:08.590
Could that happen to us?

00:47:08.590 --> 00:47:13.429
Could our preferences cloud our perception?

00:47:13.469 --> 00:47:16.429
What if we imagine one thing regarding a current

00:47:16.429 --> 00:47:19.510
or a future assignment, but were presented

00:47:19.510 --> 00:47:22.949
with something entirely different?

00:47:23.909 --> 00:47:25.269
What do we do?

00:47:25.269 --> 00:47:27.789
What if we receive counsel about our attitude

00:47:27.789 --> 00:47:30.030
as did James and John?

00:47:30.030 --> 00:47:31.909
James and John learned from the counsel.

00:47:31.909 --> 00:47:33.150
They developed a balance.

00:47:33.150 --> 00:47:36.389
They mastered the self-sacrificing spirit.

00:47:36.389 --> 00:47:37.869
What do you think?

00:47:37.869 --> 00:47:41.949
Did Jesus grant their request?

00:47:41.949 --> 00:47:43.949
No, he did something better.

00:47:43.949 --> 00:47:47.829
In verses 38 through 45, he imparted the understanding

00:47:47.829 --> 00:47:50.949
they would need to fulfill their role.

00:47:50.949 --> 00:47:54.030
And what happened next?

00:47:54.030 --> 00:47:57.789
Provided in an indirect way an object lesson

00:47:57.789 --> 00:48:02.110
in how they could show the depth of their desire

00:48:02.110 --> 00:48:04.389
to please Jehovah.

00:48:04.389 --> 00:48:07.309
Mark chapter 10, verse 51.

00:48:07.309 --> 00:48:10.110
Jesus again asks the same question.

00:48:10.110 --> 00:48:14.469
He posed to James and John this time to Bartimaeus.

00:48:15.309 --> 00:48:17.429
Jesus said to him,

00:48:17.429 --> 00:48:20.309
what do you want me to do for you?

00:48:20.309 --> 00:48:21.789
The blind man said to him,

00:48:21.789 --> 00:48:25.429
Rebony, let me recover my sight.

00:48:25.429 --> 00:48:27.510
And Jesus said to him, go,

00:48:27.510 --> 00:48:30.190
your faith has made you well.

00:48:31.710 --> 00:48:36.750
Have you ever encountered a real beggar, not a con artist,

00:48:36.750 --> 00:48:40.829
but someone who is utterly destitute.

00:48:40.829 --> 00:48:43.590
They know that they will simply perish

00:48:43.590 --> 00:48:47.349
except for the mercy of strangers.

00:48:47.349 --> 00:48:49.989
Sad reality of our times.

00:48:49.989 --> 00:48:53.469
But we can learn something from a beggar.

00:48:53.469 --> 00:48:56.869
Bartimaeus did not make one simple request

00:48:56.869 --> 00:48:58.230
and then go silent.

00:48:58.230 --> 00:49:01.070
Verse 47, we find him shouting.

00:49:01.070 --> 00:49:06.110
Verse 48, at this, many began rebuking him,

00:49:06.110 --> 00:49:07.590
telling him to be silent.

00:49:07.590 --> 00:49:10.789
But all the more he kept shouting,

00:49:10.829 --> 00:49:13.389
in verse 50, he leaps to his feet.

00:49:13.389 --> 00:49:17.309
He echolocates Jesus and he pleads his case.

00:49:17.309 --> 00:49:19.710
Now, doesn't that remind you of the kind of effort

00:49:19.710 --> 00:49:22.630
that's needed to satisfy our spiritual needs?

00:49:22.630 --> 00:49:26.110
Jesus' words, Matthew chapter 5, verse 3, happy,

00:49:26.110 --> 00:49:31.110
are those conscious of or beggars for the spirit,

00:49:31.190 --> 00:49:33.349
conscious of their spiritual need

00:49:33.349 --> 00:49:35.710
for the kingdom of the heavens belongs to them.

00:49:35.710 --> 00:49:40.429
Some have said that Gilead has heightened the degree

00:49:40.469 --> 00:49:44.829
of their consciousness in this regard.

00:49:45.949 --> 00:49:51.349
For them, it's helped them to more keenly perceive

00:49:51.349 --> 00:49:55.949
their utter spiritual destitution.

00:49:55.949 --> 00:49:57.989
Take that with you.

00:49:57.989 --> 00:50:00.510
Be a Bartimaeus.

00:50:00.510 --> 00:50:01.670
Don't give up.

00:50:01.670 --> 00:50:03.789
Don't give into pressure to stop begging.

00:50:03.789 --> 00:50:05.989
Don't give Jehovah any silence

00:50:05.989 --> 00:50:10.989
until his purpose is completely accomplished.

00:50:11.429 --> 00:50:12.949
Unlike the daughter of Herodius,

00:50:12.949 --> 00:50:17.309
you have willingly chosen to make Jehovah's will your will.

00:50:17.309 --> 00:50:19.789
Like Solomon, beg for wisdom,

00:50:19.789 --> 00:50:22.030
but don't give up in the pursuit of it.

00:50:22.030 --> 00:50:25.550
Like Elisha, beg for Holy Spirit and for courage,

00:50:25.550 --> 00:50:27.469
but doing so in Jesus' name.

00:50:27.469 --> 00:50:29.989
Like James and John keep the kingdom

00:50:29.989 --> 00:50:31.909
hope burning brightly.

00:50:31.909 --> 00:50:35.750
Learn from your mistakes without losing your fire

00:50:35.789 --> 00:50:38.269
and you will inherit the kingdom.

00:50:38.269 --> 00:50:41.389
May you dear students of the 140th class keep the words

00:50:41.389 --> 00:50:46.389
of Psalm 37 verse four and its footnote constantly before you.

00:50:46.949 --> 00:50:50.429
Find your greatest joy in Jehovah

00:50:50.429 --> 00:50:55.429
and he will grant you the desires of your heart.

00:51:08.670 --> 00:51:10.269
Thank you very much, brother Schaefer.

00:51:10.269 --> 00:51:12.349
That was very helpful.

00:51:12.349 --> 00:51:15.590
But now we have another helper to the teaching committee

00:51:15.590 --> 00:51:19.030
and brother Numer also serves as the overseer

00:51:19.030 --> 00:51:22.030
of the Theocratic schools department.

00:51:22.030 --> 00:51:24.829
And he's gonna take us on a trip,

00:51:24.829 --> 00:51:29.829
his theme journey with Jehovah, brother Mark Numer.

00:51:30.829 --> 00:51:34.750
When you take a journey, you can go alone

00:51:35.750 --> 00:51:37.469
or you can take someone with you.

00:51:38.909 --> 00:51:42.230
As you journey on the road to life,

00:51:42.230 --> 00:51:45.550
be determined to take Jehovah with you

00:51:45.590 --> 00:51:49.710
and stick with him even if the route takes an unexpected turn

00:51:49.710 --> 00:51:51.349
you did not anticipate.

00:51:52.550 --> 00:51:53.989
And if you do,

00:51:55.230 --> 00:51:59.070
Jehovah will take you to places spiritually.

00:51:59.070 --> 00:52:01.949
You have never been before.

00:52:02.949 --> 00:52:06.230
And to places you cannot get to on your own

00:52:07.389 --> 00:52:12.070
and you will experience a blessing that only he can give.

00:52:13.070 --> 00:52:16.469
And our discussion now will focus on Jacob.

00:52:16.469 --> 00:52:17.510
Why?

00:52:17.510 --> 00:52:20.389
Because he took Jehovah with him

00:52:20.389 --> 00:52:22.949
as he traveled through life.

00:52:22.949 --> 00:52:26.190
Now let's see the lessons you can learn.

00:52:26.190 --> 00:52:30.030
And we begin by opening up to Genesis chapter 25.

00:52:30.030 --> 00:52:34.429
We're going to read verse 23.

00:52:34.429 --> 00:52:35.909
25, 23.

00:52:36.869 --> 00:52:40.110
And Jehovah said to her, Rebecca,

00:52:40.110 --> 00:52:41.909
two nations are in your womb,

00:52:41.909 --> 00:52:44.469
two peoples will be separated from within you

00:52:44.469 --> 00:52:48.150
and the one nation will be stronger than the other nation.

00:52:48.150 --> 00:52:51.030
And the older will serve the younger.

00:52:52.190 --> 00:52:57.190
Jehovah saw that the older he saw would serve the younger Jacob.

00:52:59.710 --> 00:53:02.670
Now, even though this promise came from Jehovah God,

00:53:02.670 --> 00:53:06.949
it did not spell a trouble free life for Jacob.

00:53:07.869 --> 00:53:10.150
There would be trials ahead,

00:53:10.150 --> 00:53:13.789
but Jacob was determined to stick with Jehovah.

00:53:13.789 --> 00:53:18.070
Even when the journey took him through hard times.

00:53:18.070 --> 00:53:22.989
For example, there was a time in Jacob's life

00:53:22.989 --> 00:53:26.230
that he stumbled into a patch of injustice.

00:53:26.230 --> 00:53:29.989
He wanted to get married on the wedding night.

00:53:29.989 --> 00:53:33.909
His uncle Laban substituted his older planar daughter,

00:53:33.909 --> 00:53:37.190
Leah, for his beloved Rachel.

00:53:38.150 --> 00:53:43.110
Chapter 29 verse 25 describes this scene.

00:53:43.110 --> 00:53:48.090
29, 25.

00:53:48.090 --> 00:53:52.409
In the morning, Jacob saw that it was Leah.

00:53:52.409 --> 00:53:58.650
Now, that is an unexpected turn in his root with Jehovah God.

00:54:00.570 --> 00:54:02.010
But what would Jacob do?

00:54:02.010 --> 00:54:04.889
Here he says to Laban, what have you done to me?

00:54:04.889 --> 00:54:07.449
It was not for Rachel that I served you.

00:54:07.610 --> 00:54:10.010
Why have you tricked me?

00:54:10.010 --> 00:54:11.650
What would Jacob do now?

00:54:11.650 --> 00:54:14.369
Would he rise up in arms against such betrayal?

00:54:14.369 --> 00:54:15.650
It gets worse.

00:54:16.610 --> 00:54:21.050
Verse 26, the very next verse, now Laban makes excuses.

00:54:21.050 --> 00:54:24.369
He makes excuses by saying, it's not our custom

00:54:24.369 --> 00:54:26.409
to give the younger before the older.

00:54:26.409 --> 00:54:28.130
It's not your custom.

00:54:28.130 --> 00:54:32.610
Outrage, Jacob could have said, look, we had a contract.

00:54:32.610 --> 00:54:34.769
I worked seven years for you.

00:54:34.769 --> 00:54:37.210
I've waited 84 years to get married

00:54:37.289 --> 00:54:39.010
and this is what you do to me.

00:54:39.010 --> 00:54:42.849
And now you say, it's not our custom.

00:54:42.849 --> 00:54:45.730
Couldn't you have at least told me ahead of time

00:54:45.730 --> 00:54:49.519
that it's not our custom?

00:54:49.519 --> 00:54:51.800
But how did Jacob respond?

00:54:52.639 --> 00:54:56.280
He agreed to work another seven years.

00:54:56.280 --> 00:54:58.199
Why didn't he walk away?

00:54:58.199 --> 00:55:02.000
Why didn't he walk away from such deceit and mistreatment?

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:05.760
There's the question, why?

00:55:05.760 --> 00:55:10.760
Because Jacob knew that Jehovah cannot be deceived.

00:55:13.800 --> 00:55:17.760
He understood that Jehovah saw what was happening

00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:24.000
and this knowledge helped Jacob to prefer peace to strife.

00:55:24.280 --> 00:55:27.639
Instead of being stubborn and demanding his rights,

00:55:27.639 --> 00:55:29.840
he left the matter in Jehovah's hands

00:55:29.840 --> 00:55:32.559
confident that he saw what happened

00:55:32.559 --> 00:55:35.559
and that he would handle it in due time.

00:55:36.599 --> 00:55:41.599
And remember, Jacob was not harmed by doing so.

00:55:42.440 --> 00:55:44.800
In fact, in just seven years,

00:55:44.800 --> 00:55:47.880
Jacob was blessed with several children.

00:55:47.880 --> 00:55:50.079
But if he had stood his ground

00:55:50.079 --> 00:55:55.840
and insisted on having only Rachel, I want Rachel.

00:55:55.840 --> 00:55:59.159
He may have only had two sons instead of 12.

00:56:00.159 --> 00:56:05.159
So again, where did this journey with Jehovah take him?

00:56:06.119 --> 00:56:10.280
Jehovah used this wrong to build a great nation out of Jacob.

00:56:11.239 --> 00:56:14.599
The Messiah came through Judah, Judah,

00:56:14.599 --> 00:56:19.599
who was Lee's son, not Rachel's.

00:56:20.519 --> 00:56:24.719
The Messiah was brought forth despite a great injustice.

00:56:24.719 --> 00:56:28.079
You see, Jacob traveled with Jehovah

00:56:28.079 --> 00:56:30.639
and Jehovah brought him to a spiritual place

00:56:30.639 --> 00:56:33.719
he could not get to on his own.

00:56:35.199 --> 00:56:38.920
Now we find Jacob with a 14-year work contract with Laban.

00:56:38.920 --> 00:56:42.239
The next seven years could have embittered Jacob.

00:56:42.239 --> 00:56:46.239
Jacob's own family suffered from jealousy and resentment.

00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:50.679
Laban continued to exploit him by unfairly changing

00:56:50.679 --> 00:56:53.800
his wages 10 times.

00:56:53.800 --> 00:56:56.159
But rather than being fed up,

00:56:56.159 --> 00:57:00.000
he maintained the right spirit and attitude.

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:01.960
It is amazing this Jacob.

00:57:02.719 --> 00:57:05.480
He didn't adopt a cynical bitter attitude.

00:57:05.480 --> 00:57:09.079
In fact, chapter 31 and verse 6,

00:57:09.079 --> 00:57:14.079
it says that I served Laban with all my power.

00:57:14.840 --> 00:57:18.000
And with all those injustices with all my power,

00:57:19.400 --> 00:57:22.639
because he did not face this test alone.

00:57:22.639 --> 00:57:24.519
He had Jehovah at his side.

00:57:24.519 --> 00:57:25.480
This is the point.

00:57:25.480 --> 00:57:27.480
He was journeying with Jehovah.

00:57:27.480 --> 00:57:29.760
Look at verse 5.

00:57:29.760 --> 00:57:31.599
He sensed it. He knew it.

00:57:31.639 --> 00:57:32.880
He got it.

00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:36.119
The God of my father has been with me.

00:57:36.119 --> 00:57:38.079
Oh, this journey with Jehovah.

00:57:38.079 --> 00:57:41.320
Was it easy? No. Was it possible?

00:57:41.320 --> 00:57:43.840
Yes, he stuck with Jehovah.

00:57:43.840 --> 00:57:46.480
Look to Jehovah for strength.

00:57:47.880 --> 00:57:51.039
Jehovah God wants you and me

00:57:52.199 --> 00:57:54.760
to learn from this true life story.

00:57:55.920 --> 00:57:57.719
Think about it.

00:57:57.719 --> 00:58:02.719
Jehovah could have arranged for Jacob to be born first.

00:58:06.210 --> 00:58:09.210
But consider what Jehovah is teaching us

00:58:09.210 --> 00:58:13.809
by arranging for the older to serve the younger.

00:58:15.130 --> 00:58:18.530
He is teaching us that we don't receive blessings

00:58:18.530 --> 00:58:22.369
through effortless inheritance.

00:58:22.369 --> 00:58:25.969
And this is the lesson we want you to learn.

00:58:25.969 --> 00:58:29.090
That journeying with Jehovah does not mean

00:58:29.090 --> 00:58:32.909
you will have an easy journey.

00:58:32.909 --> 00:58:35.309
But if you stick with Jehovah,

00:58:36.269 --> 00:58:39.269
he will take you to places spiritually,

00:58:39.269 --> 00:58:42.070
you cannot get to on your own.

00:58:43.590 --> 00:58:46.949
So hold on to the promise that Jehovah will reward you

00:58:46.949 --> 00:58:48.989
for doing what is right.

00:58:48.989 --> 00:58:52.230
Even if it means making a temporary sacrifice

00:58:52.230 --> 00:58:57.230
or suffering injustice, leave the matter in Jehovah's hands

00:58:57.349 --> 00:59:02.110
and then pay attention to how he works things out.

00:59:03.309 --> 00:59:07.030
Let Jehovah help you rise above fleshly tendencies

00:59:07.030 --> 00:59:10.110
to look out for self.

00:59:11.230 --> 00:59:14.869
Imitate Jacob, like Jacob, prefer peace to strife.

00:59:15.750 --> 00:59:19.789
For example, at Bethel, your Bethel,

00:59:19.789 --> 00:59:24.789
when you see a department that gets along, there is a cost.

00:59:24.789 --> 00:59:26.429
It's not for free.

00:59:26.429 --> 00:59:29.230
Someone is paying a price.

00:59:29.230 --> 00:59:31.429
Let that someone be you.

00:59:32.590 --> 00:59:35.269
Peace is the result of people going out of their way

00:59:35.269 --> 00:59:36.550
to maintain peace.

00:59:36.550 --> 00:59:40.539
It's not an accident.

00:59:40.539 --> 00:59:44.179
Someone is sacrificing self interest.

00:59:44.179 --> 00:59:46.420
Let that someone be you.

00:59:46.420 --> 00:59:47.260
Why not?

00:59:48.420 --> 00:59:51.500
Take the time also to encourage those

00:59:51.500 --> 00:59:55.500
that you know are going out of their way to make peace.

00:59:55.500 --> 00:59:58.019
You know who they are, do not ignore them.

00:59:59.179 --> 01:00:00.739
Perhaps the one that volunteers

01:00:00.739 --> 01:00:02.219
to take a smaller workspace,

01:00:02.219 --> 01:00:05.739
though they have this seniority for a larger one.

01:00:07.219 --> 01:00:10.579
Or the one that feels they've been overlooked

01:00:10.579 --> 01:00:14.300
for a privilege they've been passed over,

01:00:14.300 --> 01:00:17.900
and yet they don't stop working with all their power

01:00:17.900 --> 01:00:20.940
in whatever work they are given.

01:00:20.940 --> 01:00:25.619
Their journey with Jehovah reveals who they are.

01:00:26.619 --> 01:00:31.619
And Jehovah is taking them to wonderful spiritual places.

01:00:34.139 --> 01:00:37.619
Jacob's challenges do not end with Uncle Laban.

01:00:39.260 --> 01:00:43.420
At 97 years old, and after 20 years of strife and tension,

01:00:43.420 --> 01:00:47.539
no doubt Jacob urns for peace as he heads home.

01:00:48.500 --> 01:00:52.380
But his journey with Jehovah now brings him face-to-face

01:00:52.380 --> 01:00:54.940
with yet another lesson.

01:00:56.179 --> 01:00:58.219
Here's the situation.

01:00:58.219 --> 01:01:03.219
His brother Esau, and his 400 men are advancing toward Jacob.

01:01:03.219 --> 01:01:08.219
All Jacob remembers is that Esau told Mom he would kill me.

01:01:09.980 --> 01:01:12.500
Jacob is up all night, tired and scared.

01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:13.739
Facing such a crisis,

01:01:13.739 --> 01:01:17.019
imagine the relief when an angel appears.

01:01:17.019 --> 01:01:18.380
Good, an angel.

01:01:18.380 --> 01:01:21.460
Surely this angel is here to strengthen me.

01:01:21.460 --> 01:01:25.619
However, it seems that the angel wants to pick a fight.

01:01:26.860 --> 01:01:31.460
Now, chapter 32 and verse 24.

01:01:32.780 --> 01:01:33.780
Here it is.

01:01:33.780 --> 01:01:37.139
The man began to wrestle with me until the dawn broke.

01:01:37.139 --> 01:01:39.380
You want to wrestle with me now?

01:01:40.739 --> 01:01:42.340
Bad timing.

01:01:42.340 --> 01:01:45.260
But journeying with Jehovah in this case

01:01:45.260 --> 01:01:48.019
resulted in a crippling injury for Jacob.

01:01:48.019 --> 01:01:52.659
He would limp the rest of his life.

01:01:52.659 --> 01:01:56.780
But Jehovah saw fit for Jacob to have this experience

01:01:56.780 --> 01:01:58.780
at this time in his life.

01:02:00.219 --> 01:02:02.739
Perhaps to teach him humility.

01:02:02.739 --> 01:02:05.900
A constant reminder not to be overly exalted

01:02:05.900 --> 01:02:08.139
about his God-given prosperity,

01:02:08.139 --> 01:02:13.139
or the blessings that he would receive in the future.

01:02:14.139 --> 01:02:18.139
Now, Jacob didn't understand why Jehovah was allowing this.

01:02:19.579 --> 01:02:23.659
But he showed deep appreciation for spiritual things.

01:02:23.659 --> 01:02:26.139
Look what happens in verse 26.

01:02:26.139 --> 01:02:31.139
Even though his hip was dislocated, the man is in pain.

01:02:31.260 --> 01:02:33.059
And yet, verse 26 says,

01:02:33.059 --> 01:02:36.460
I'm not going to let you go until you bless me.

01:02:36.460 --> 01:02:41.460
Point, Jacob held on tighter after he was hurt.

01:02:41.460 --> 01:02:45.460
The man is hurt and he clung tighter to Jehovah.

01:02:45.460 --> 01:02:48.780
What was Jacob's blessing for doing this?

01:02:49.739 --> 01:02:51.539
A name change.

01:02:51.539 --> 01:02:53.059
Verse 28.

01:02:53.059 --> 01:02:55.940
Your name will be no longer Jacob, but Israel.

01:02:57.300 --> 01:03:00.019
But to Jacob, that was precious.

01:03:00.019 --> 01:03:02.780
He knew the name change had deep meaning.

01:03:02.780 --> 01:03:05.820
Abram to Abraham, Sarah to Sarah.

01:03:05.820 --> 01:03:10.139
And now Jacob to Israel, think about it.

01:03:10.139 --> 01:03:15.139
After Jehovah, no name in scripture is used more than Israel.

01:03:17.579 --> 01:03:20.539
True, many of those occurrences refer to the nation,

01:03:20.539 --> 01:03:23.900
but the name of the nation, including spiritual Israel,

01:03:23.900 --> 01:03:26.820
came from the man, Jacob.

01:03:27.900 --> 01:03:32.099
Because Jacob held tight despite the pain,

01:03:32.099 --> 01:03:33.699
despite the hurt.

01:03:33.699 --> 01:03:36.619
Jehovah brought him to a spiritual place.

01:03:36.659 --> 01:03:40.460
He could have never reached on his own.

01:03:41.460 --> 01:03:42.699
The lesson for you.

01:03:43.739 --> 01:03:48.739
At times, your blessings are disguised as trials.

01:03:49.980 --> 01:03:53.579
In order for you to be more useful to Jehovah God,

01:03:53.579 --> 01:03:58.579
he may allow a series of events to unfold in your life

01:03:59.699 --> 01:04:02.019
and the events could be painful.

01:04:02.860 --> 01:04:06.460
Perhaps you receive counsel that hurts.

01:04:07.340 --> 01:04:09.860
Your reputation is questioned.

01:04:09.860 --> 01:04:13.380
Your spirit may be broken, your dignity pummeled.

01:04:13.380 --> 01:04:15.940
When the strongest instinct is to give up, walk away.

01:04:15.940 --> 01:04:17.900
I don't need this.

01:04:17.900 --> 01:04:19.380
Hold on tight.

01:04:19.380 --> 01:04:20.860
Don't let go.

01:04:20.860 --> 01:04:23.820
Kling to Jehovah, no matter the hurt.

01:04:23.820 --> 01:04:26.179
Learn the lesson of humility.

01:04:26.179 --> 01:04:27.340
Pray, stay busy.

01:04:27.340 --> 01:04:30.820
Keep moving forward with God's spirit-directed organization.

01:04:30.820 --> 01:04:32.579
Fight for that reward.

01:04:33.780 --> 01:04:35.500
What reward?

01:04:35.500 --> 01:04:41.980
For a future blessing that only can come from Jehovah.

01:04:41.980 --> 01:04:46.980
At times, we may feel like Jacob when he told Pharaoh,

01:04:47.460 --> 01:04:50.219
the years of my life have been few and distressing.

01:04:51.340 --> 01:04:54.179
However, and despite all the hardships

01:04:54.179 --> 01:04:56.900
that this man experienced just before his death,

01:04:56.900 --> 01:04:59.820
what did the man Jacob say?

01:04:59.860 --> 01:05:03.179
He said, the true God has been shepherding me

01:05:03.179 --> 01:05:05.139
all my life.

01:05:05.139 --> 01:05:06.539
What a journey.

01:05:06.539 --> 01:05:08.539
His journey with Jehovah God brought him

01:05:08.539 --> 01:05:13.940
no resentment, just gratitude.

01:05:13.940 --> 01:05:17.860
Now in conclusion, I have two points I want you to remember.

01:05:19.219 --> 01:05:24.659
Not for a written exercise,

01:05:24.659 --> 01:05:29.420
but I want these two points to be indelibly etched

01:05:29.420 --> 01:05:33.519
on your mind and heart.

01:05:33.559 --> 01:05:35.840
One, like Jacob.

01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:39.599
When you stumble into a patch of injustice

01:05:39.599 --> 01:05:42.360
or disappointment or unfair treatment,

01:05:42.360 --> 01:05:47.360
trust Jehovah will help you rise above fleshly tendencies

01:05:47.679 --> 01:05:52.300
and he will help you to grow spiritually.

01:05:52.300 --> 01:05:54.739
Let him take you past all the injustices

01:05:54.739 --> 01:05:56.380
to great spiritual blessings.

01:05:56.380 --> 01:06:01.489
It's the only way to come out a winner.

01:06:01.489 --> 01:06:04.489
And when you experience a hurtful situation,

01:06:05.489 --> 01:06:10.489
hold tightly to the promise that Jehovah God will reward you

01:06:10.489 --> 01:06:14.489
in due time for doing what is right.

01:06:15.489 --> 01:06:18.090
Stick to Jehovah.

01:06:18.090 --> 01:06:22.289
Stick with him even through the rough neighborhoods,

01:06:23.289 --> 01:06:25.730
the rocky roads, the uphill climbs,

01:06:25.730 --> 01:06:28.610
he'll not only help you with the hard parts of the journey,

01:06:28.610 --> 01:06:33.610
but again, he will take you to places spiritually,

01:06:34.210 --> 01:06:37.170
you can never get to on your own.

01:06:37.170 --> 01:06:39.610
That's the privilege, that's the point.

01:06:40.489 --> 01:06:44.369
More than 3,700 years after Jacob's death,

01:06:44.369 --> 01:06:47.449
let his life course please, we urge you

01:06:48.409 --> 01:06:51.650
to continue to teach you no matter what circumstances

01:06:51.650 --> 01:06:53.329
come your way.

01:06:53.329 --> 01:07:14.849
Keep journeying with Jehovah.

01:07:14.849 --> 01:07:17.650
Well, it's obvious the students really appreciated

01:07:17.650 --> 01:07:20.250
that faith strengthening talk.

01:07:21.130 --> 01:07:23.969
But now we're gonna have an opportunity to stand

01:07:23.969 --> 01:07:26.730
and sing a song of praise to Jehovah.

01:07:28.329 --> 01:07:33.329
We have song number 84, I want to.

01:07:33.769 --> 01:07:37.489
And that's taken from Luke 513.

01:07:38.849 --> 01:07:42.409
Song number 84, I want to.
