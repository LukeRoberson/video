00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:15.359
Since the 1980s, the Central American branch has been organizing special preaching campaigns

00:00:15.359 --> 00:00:19.600
to seldom more territories, unassigned territories.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.399
Both here in Mexico and also throughout all of Central America.

00:00:23.399 --> 00:00:29.239
Matter of fact, in the last campaign we had 13,000 regular pioneers assigned to over

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:35.039
900 congregations and in some areas where there weren't even congregations.

00:00:35.039 --> 00:00:37.880
For example, in El Salvador.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:42.039
When we were assigned here, we were told that there were no witnesses, no Bible studies

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:43.880
and no publishers.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:49.880
This is the second meeting with HAC, the public talk, and today we had 12 new ones attend.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:54.960
Well, since we are in a rural area, you have to do a lot of walking.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.359
We've had to deal with the cows and other smaller creatures like ticks.

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:03.759
Eight or nine brothers were staying in one house.

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:09.840
So they had to get up super early, sometimes at four in the morning, just to get ready

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.640
on time.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.040
The brothers who come on these campaigns come resolved to help the congregation.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:23.120
They're really enthusiastic about the ministry and it's contagious.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.879
We've found many studies and many return visits, we just don't have enough time to care

00:01:26.879 --> 00:01:28.159
for them all.

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:32.760
Some of the publishers are assigned to areas where the congregations are small or they're

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:33.760
isolated.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.560
For example, here in Mexico, there was a group of willing, energetic pioneers that were

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:44.239
assigned to an area and it just injected life into the local publishers and even the entire

00:01:44.239 --> 00:01:47.640
congregation benefited.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:54.079
We could see that the congregation really blossomed in showing hospitality, generosity and love.

00:01:54.079 --> 00:02:00.640
It made the congregation more united and we could tell they were happier.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:06.239
They encouraged me and make me want to preach more.

00:02:06.239 --> 00:02:08.560
At one point, we were surrounded by people.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.560
They were so spiritually starved that they were just asking us for publications.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.479
It always seems that the ones that go on these campaigns never forget the experiences that

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:21.199
they've had.

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:24.639
The brothers in Costa Rica are going to share their stories with us.

00:02:24.639 --> 00:02:30.080
I remember one sister who said she had to sell bread and other products for an entire

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:35.080
year just to be able to come and serve in our congregation.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.439
On one occasion, we preached to a lady who had 10 children.

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:43.919
It really moved me when she showed up at the Kingdom Hall with all of her 10 children.

00:02:43.919 --> 00:02:48.919
The effort I make has even motivated my mom to renew her Bible study and get to know more

00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:50.240
about Jehovah.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:56.840
In fact, there were some territories that we hadn't preached in four years because they are so

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.000
far away.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.479
But thanks to these brothers and the effort they made, we were able to cover all of our

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:04.280
congregation's territory.

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:09.680
Wow, I'm really happy because just seeing the brothers here gives me strength to keep

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.080
going.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.919
We met a young woman who had been praying all week because she wanted to get to know

00:03:14.919 --> 00:03:15.919
God better.

00:03:15.919 --> 00:03:19.560
She was going through a really tough time, so when we showed her one of our tracks and

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.919
she saw that it was based on the Bible, she burst into tears.

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:26.240
She realized it was the answers to her prayers.

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:31.680
In Panama, the brothers and sisters have seen the results of their hard work and effort.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:38.159
Second Corinthians 9.6 says those that so boundifully will reap boundifully, and they've seen

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:40.840
the truthfulness of those words.

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.439
My family has benefited.

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:46.680
For example, my daughter got baptized in the last assembly, and I've been encouraged as

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:47.680
well.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.039
Now I'm a regular pioneer.

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:54.280
It generates a real pioneer spirit in the congregation, and that spurs up brothers

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.039
onto greater activity.

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:59.680
Some even want to fill out auxiliary pioneer applications.

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.719
When you come on a campaign like this, something enjoyable is that people you didn't even

00:04:03.719 --> 00:04:06.759
know before become your closest friends.

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:10.120
My relationship with Jehovah has gotten stronger.

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.919
I've seen how he never abandons me.

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:20.600
For many, these campaigns are a life-altering or life-changing experience.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:25.519
All the work that the brothers and sisters put forth is worth it when they see the

00:04:25.519 --> 00:04:29.759
gratitude and the appreciation of their Bible students.

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:37.019
And Nicaragua is a country where people show that gratefulness for spiritual things.

00:04:37.019 --> 00:04:42.139
We spoke with a farmer on one occasion, and farmers in Nicaragua do not make very much,

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:47.259
but he was so appreciative of the publications we had placed with him that he gave us some

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:53.100
that could possibly amount to a good fourth or a third of his daily wages.

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:56.980
People would have the opportunity to go on these campaigns they would not regret it.

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:58.300
They would have amazing experience.

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:03.220
I've done it myself, and these experiences, these wonderful opportunities that one would

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:07.420
have to preach on these campaigns would be remembered for the rest of their lives.
