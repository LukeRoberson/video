00:00:10.189 --> 00:00:16.190
The human voice is a marvelous instrument, capable of great variety.

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.190
When we vary our volume, pitch, and pace,

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:25.190
so as to convey ideas clearly and stir emotion,

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:28.190
we're using modulation.

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:32.189
Why is modulation important when speaking?

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.189
For the same reason, it's important when playing a musical instrument.

00:00:37.189 --> 00:00:41.189
How would music sound without modulation?

00:00:41.189 --> 00:00:55.619
It's not very appealing, is it?

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:58.619
Now, let's vary the volume.

00:00:58.619 --> 00:01:24.340
Let's also add changes in pace.

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.340
Finally, let's add variations in pitch.

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:45.090
When the musician varied the volume, pace, and pitch,

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.090
the result was something pleasurable to listen to.

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.090
To illustrate the importance of doing this when we speak,

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.090
let's listen as a speaker presents fine information,

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.090
but with little modulation.

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.090
After 40 years of wandering in the wilderness,

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.090
the Israelites are on the verge of a momentous change.

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.090
They're about to take possession of the Promised Land.

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.090
Tents will be replaced by houses.

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.090
Manna will be replaced by meat and vegetables.

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.090
At last, they will be able to worship Jehovah

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.090
as a free and spiritually clean people.

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.090
Still, challenges awaited them.

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.090
What would Moses say shortly before his death

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.090
to encourage and prepare them?

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:36.090
Let's find out by reading Deuteronomy 31 verses 7 and 8.

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.090
We stopped the speaker before he read the scripture

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.090
and finished making the point

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.090
because he was difficult to listen to.

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.090
Let's watch him try again.

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:55.590
But this time, he varies his volume, pitch, and pace.

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.590
After 40 years of wandering in the wilderness,

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.590
the Israelites are on the verge of a momentous change.

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.590
They're about to take possession of the Promised Land.

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.590
Tents will be replaced by houses.

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.590
Manna will be replaced by meat and vegetables.

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.590
At last, they'll be able to worship Jehovah

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.590
as a free and spiritually clean people.

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.590
Still, challenges awaited them.

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.590
What would Moses say shortly before his death

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.590
to encourage and prepare them?

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:36.590
Let's find out by reading Deuteronomy 31 verses 7 and 8.

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:42.629
Moses then called Joshua and sent to him

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:44.629
before the eyes of all Israel.

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:47.629
Be courageous and strong.

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:51.629
For you are the one who will bring this people into the land

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:55.629
that Jehovah swore to their forefathers to give to them,

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:58.629
and you will give it to them as an inheritance.

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:01.629
Jehovah is the one marching before you,

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:04.629
and he will continue with you.

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:07.629
He will neither desert you nor abandon you.

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:11.629
Do not be afraid or be terrified.

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:15.629
It was much better, wasn't it?

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:18.629
Did you notice how the speaker built anticipation

00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:22.629
for the Scripture by lowering his volume as he asked?

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:26.629
What would Moses say shortly before his death

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:29.629
to encourage and prepare them?

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:35.629
Then he increased his volume when reading Moses' excitation.

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:40.629
If we strive to read and speak with modulation

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:43.629
we'll convey the ideas more clearly

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:46.629
and stir the emotion of our listeners.
