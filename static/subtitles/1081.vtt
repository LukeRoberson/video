WEBVTT

00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:04.099
Warm greetings to one and all.

00:00:04.099 --> 00:00:09.099
The final session of our Always Rejoice Regional Convention is about to begin.

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:12.099
Please take your seats.

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:15.099
As you watched the music video presentation,

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:22.100
reflect on the joy that we share with fellow servants of Jehovah both past and present.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:27.100
Please listen quietly and enjoy the video.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:36.100
Please listen quietly and enjoy the video.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:48.689
Please listen quietly and enjoy the video.

00:01:22.930 --> 00:10:46.789
Please listen quietly and enjoy the video.

00:10:46.789 --> 00:10:50.789
We have now reached the final portion of this convention.

00:10:50.789 --> 00:10:57.789
The program will emphasize the joy that comes from our close relationship with Jehovah.

00:10:57.789 --> 00:11:01.789
Let's stand and sing a song that expresses our heartfelt joy.

00:11:01.789 --> 00:11:06.789
The song is number 62 entitled The New Song.

00:11:06.789 --> 00:11:09.789
Again, that song number 62.

00:11:09.789 --> 00:13:49.220
Please be seated.

00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:56.240
Earlier, we learned how Nehemiah and his fellow workers overcame opposition

00:13:56.240 --> 00:14:00.240
and successfully completed Jerusalem walls.

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:03.240
But what further challenges lay ahead of them?

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:09.240
We now invite you to watch the drama stirring conclusion, Nehemiah.

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:13.240
The joy of Jehovah is your stronghold, part two.

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:31.639
It was now Tishrae, the start of a month-long festival.

00:14:31.639 --> 00:14:37.919
He had just rebuilt the wall of Jehovah's Great City.

00:14:37.919 --> 00:14:44.919
Now, it was time to rebuild the spirituality of his chosen people.

00:14:44.919 --> 00:14:46.919
Many did not know God's law.

00:14:46.919 --> 00:14:55.419
Who better to help us gain understanding than a man who had come before me, Ezra?

00:14:55.419 --> 00:15:00.830
The regulations and judicial decisions of Jehovah.

00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:05.830
He and other Levites read aloud from the law of Moses.

00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:14.620
They not only read it, they explained it, putting meaning into it.

00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:19.620
As a people, we began to understand how badly we had disappointed Jehovah

00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:26.019
by working on the Sabbath, offering lame sacrifices,

00:15:26.019 --> 00:15:30.019
and divorcing our wives to marry foreign women.

00:15:30.019 --> 00:15:33.019
It hurt our hearts.

00:15:33.019 --> 00:15:38.019
But by reading God's law, we were learning to beat Jehovah's people again.

00:15:38.019 --> 00:15:41.019
Do not mourn or weep.

00:15:41.019 --> 00:15:46.019
Now that you know what displeases God, you can do what pleases Him.

00:15:46.019 --> 00:15:48.019
So go.

00:15:48.019 --> 00:15:50.019
Eat the choice things.

00:15:50.019 --> 00:15:52.019
And drink what is sweet.

00:15:52.019 --> 00:15:55.019
And send portion to those who have nothing.

00:15:55.019 --> 00:15:57.019
And do not feel sad.

00:15:57.019 --> 00:16:01.019
For the joy of Jehovah is your stronghold.

00:16:01.019 --> 00:16:12.190
We followed Jehovah's instructions to observe the festival of booths.

00:16:12.190 --> 00:16:34.090
We spent days rejoicing and giving thanks for Jehovah's blessing.

00:16:34.090 --> 00:16:43.799
Then on the 24th day, we assembled to read God's law, to confess our sins,

00:16:43.799 --> 00:16:45.799
and to weep over our wrongdoing.

00:16:45.799 --> 00:16:57.950
We made a binding agreement in writing.

00:16:57.950 --> 00:17:24.890
We resolved to obey Jehovah's law.

00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:26.890
Some soon forgot their promise.

00:17:26.890 --> 00:17:35.470
Pilate.

00:17:35.470 --> 00:17:36.470
Who's our renterman?

00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:39.470
Put him in a bag, baskets hard to carry.

00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:45.990
You hear about Nehemiah's latest idea?

00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:48.990
I mean a plan to repopulate Jerusalem?

00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:51.990
I mean this ridiculous proposal, the force families to move into the city,

00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:53.990
one out of ten by lot.

00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:56.910
Yes, I heard.

00:17:56.910 --> 00:17:58.910
And I had to be one who was chosen.

00:17:58.910 --> 00:18:00.910
Why me?

00:18:00.910 --> 00:18:03.910
Does he care what this does to landholders like me?

00:18:04.910 --> 00:18:10.289
Oh, so why are you supposed to move?

00:18:10.289 --> 00:18:11.289
Move?

00:18:11.289 --> 00:18:12.289
I'm not moving anywhere.

00:18:12.289 --> 00:18:16.289
I have a right to live where I choose, and so do you.

00:18:16.289 --> 00:18:17.289
I wasn't selected.

00:18:17.289 --> 00:18:18.289
Not yet, you mean.

00:18:18.289 --> 00:18:25.099
And when you are, I need you to join me in refusing to move.

00:18:25.099 --> 00:18:31.180
Rayham, the king sent Nehemiah here to rebuild the city.

00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:35.299
Nehemiah is the governor.

00:18:35.299 --> 00:18:37.299
Governors come, governors go.

00:18:37.299 --> 00:18:40.299
The king is waiting for Nehemiah to return, and when he does,

00:18:40.299 --> 00:18:42.299
things will get back to normal.

00:18:42.299 --> 00:18:46.299
Even when Nehemiah goes back, Jehovah will still be here.

00:18:46.299 --> 00:18:49.299
It is his will that Jerusalem be rebuilt.

00:18:49.299 --> 00:18:52.609
Don't you believe that?

00:18:52.609 --> 00:18:55.609
So you will go along, Nehemiah.

00:18:55.609 --> 00:18:57.609
How can you be so ungrateful?

00:18:57.609 --> 00:19:05.819
Rayham, you're right.

00:19:05.819 --> 00:19:20.140
What was that all about?

00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:22.140
Rayham refuses to move into Jerusalem.

00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:28.680
He wants us to support him.

00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:32.440
What did you say?

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:35.440
I told him Nehemiah is doing job as well.

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:39.910
Rayham doesn't understand how happy he could be.

00:19:39.910 --> 00:19:45.920
He would just follow Jehovah's direction.

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:48.920
So we will move if we're selected.

00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:51.299
Yes.

00:19:51.299 --> 00:19:56.380
I'd rather be like Nehemiah.

00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:58.380
And like Rayham.

00:19:58.380 --> 00:19:59.380
Do you agree?

00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:00.380
Yes.

00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:02.380
I'll meet you.

00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:13.089
At the inauguration of the walls,

00:20:13.089 --> 00:20:23.589
we filled Jerusalem with songs of praise and thanksgiving to God.

00:20:23.589 --> 00:20:30.529
Our great joy could be heard from far away.

00:20:30.529 --> 00:20:32.529
When I finally returned to the king,

00:20:32.529 --> 00:20:35.529
I thought about that day often.

00:20:35.529 --> 00:20:53.029
With what I know now, I wish I had never left.

00:20:53.029 --> 00:20:55.029
Jehovah raised up a messenger

00:20:55.029 --> 00:20:59.029
who chronicled the themes that happened in Jerusalem during my absence.

00:20:59.029 --> 00:21:02.410
His name was Malachi.

00:21:02.410 --> 00:21:09.759
Tobiah, despite not being a Jew,

00:21:09.759 --> 00:21:12.759
still found his way into the temple.

00:21:12.759 --> 00:21:20.190
He utilized his Jewish family ties to take advantage of the other Jews.

00:21:20.190 --> 00:21:22.190
What brings you to the temple?

00:21:22.190 --> 00:21:23.190
It's ten some time.

00:21:23.190 --> 00:21:25.190
I just wanted to see you.

00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:30.190
Oh, and to bring you this small gift.

00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:33.190
Tobiah, you're always so generous.

00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:36.190
It's nothing really.

00:21:36.190 --> 00:21:38.190
Is there nothing I can do for you?

00:21:38.190 --> 00:21:40.190
Well, since you asked.

00:21:40.190 --> 00:21:42.190
There's one little thing you can do.

00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:44.190
Tell me, what can I do for you?

00:21:44.190 --> 00:21:47.190
Well, speaking of family.

00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:50.190
When our relatives, here's a mine, I mean.

00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:52.190
Visit from Samaria.

00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:55.190
It would be so nice to have a place to eat with them.

00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:58.190
You know, right here in the temple, that is.

00:21:58.190 --> 00:22:01.190
After all, they worship Jehovah too.

00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:03.190
Often.

00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:06.190
Okay, well, sometimes.

00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:08.190
A room in the temple?

00:22:08.190 --> 00:22:10.190
But you know, I can't do that.

00:22:10.190 --> 00:22:14.789
That is all the rooms are in use.

00:22:14.789 --> 00:22:16.789
All of them.

00:22:16.789 --> 00:22:18.789
Aren't some of them just storerooms?

00:22:18.789 --> 00:22:23.039
But those are provisions for the Levites.

00:22:23.039 --> 00:22:25.039
But can't you clear one out for me?

00:22:25.039 --> 00:22:26.039
Just one.

00:22:26.039 --> 00:22:28.039
I only need one.

00:22:28.039 --> 00:22:31.039
But what will Nehemiah say?

00:22:31.039 --> 00:22:34.039
What differences it make?

00:22:34.039 --> 00:22:37.039
Nehemiah's far away in Shushan.

00:22:37.039 --> 00:22:39.039
But what if he finds out?

00:22:39.039 --> 00:22:41.039
Who is going to tell him?

00:22:41.039 --> 00:22:42.039
Are you going to tell him?

00:22:42.039 --> 00:22:43.039
No, no.

00:22:43.039 --> 00:22:45.039
Then, I worry.

00:22:45.039 --> 00:23:01.450
So once again, our high priest has given in to Tobiah.

00:23:01.450 --> 00:23:05.140
Where should I put this grade?

00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:06.140
There's room here.

00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:07.140
Be careful.

00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:10.960
I've got it.

00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:11.960
Look who's coming.

00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:18.140
Can you hurry, please?

00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:20.140
Once they get out of our way.

00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:23.140
Let's, uh, let's set the table here.

00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:26.140
And then the chairs come along the wall.

00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:28.140
Tobiah, tell me, please.

00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:30.140
Where should we store provisions now?

00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:31.140
Wherever you want.

00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:33.140
That's your problem.

00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:35.140
And move along.

00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:37.140
Like now, please.

00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:44.900
All right, so.

00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:47.900
How could Eliashim let anyone?

00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:51.900
Let a lone man like Tobiah take over a room for his own use?

00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:56.900
After all that Nehemiah did to preserve the sacredness of the temple.

00:23:56.900 --> 00:23:59.900
Most people don't get the ties anymore anyway.

00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:02.900
If we want to eat, we need to go tend our own flocks in the fields.

00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:05.900
It's of no value to serve God.

00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:08.900
Wait, brothers.

00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:11.900
We can't let their wrong acts take away our joy.

00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:12.900
Why not?

00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:14.900
How have we benefited from serving Jehovah?

00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:15.900
Yes.

00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:21.920
And does in the scriptures say, take good care of your sheep?

00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:25.920
It also says, a faithful man will receive many blessings.

00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:27.920
We must wait on Jehovah.

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:33.900
In time, he will straighten everything out.

00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:37.900
Malakai saw how far the people had fallen.

00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:41.900
The Levites, once the proud keepers of Jehovah's standards,

00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:45.900
now found themselves questioning the value of their own service.

00:24:45.900 --> 00:25:18.099
Young man, I'll offer a sheep.

00:25:18.099 --> 00:25:23.380
The bigger the offering, the bigger the blessings.

00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:27.380
And besides, you know it's more impressive to the neighbors, huh?

00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:30.039
Thank you.

00:25:30.039 --> 00:25:31.039
I already have an offer.

00:25:31.039 --> 00:25:32.039
Yes, yes.

00:25:32.039 --> 00:25:36.039
But look, you seem like a nice man.

00:25:36.039 --> 00:25:39.039
So today for you, a special price, huh?

00:25:39.039 --> 00:25:41.039
Hardly more than you paid for these duffs.

00:25:41.039 --> 00:25:42.039
Come take a look.

00:25:42.039 --> 00:25:45.990
That sheep is blind.

00:25:45.990 --> 00:25:47.990
And look at how it works.

00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:51.990
Young man, that's absolutely normal for this breed.

00:25:51.990 --> 00:25:55.990
God's law says not to offer blind, lame or sick animals.

00:25:55.990 --> 00:25:59.990
If ever I can afford to offer a sheep, it'll be a sound one.

00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:00.990
Don't waste your money.

00:26:00.990 --> 00:26:02.990
She's a fine sheep at a fine price.

00:26:02.990 --> 00:26:03.990
I have to go.

00:26:03.990 --> 00:26:04.990
Be practical.

00:26:04.990 --> 00:26:11.579
Besides, it's only a tradition.

00:26:11.579 --> 00:26:14.579
Temple services are not the same.

00:26:14.579 --> 00:26:22.250
It's as if they don't even think about your home.

00:26:22.250 --> 00:26:25.250
Zuba, what's wrong?

00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:28.849
Zuba, what happened?

00:26:28.849 --> 00:26:32.859
How's Reham?

00:26:32.859 --> 00:26:43.299
Certificate of divorce.

00:26:43.299 --> 00:26:50.440
I tried to be a good wife, but it wasn't enough.

00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:56.150
Reham sent me away.

00:26:56.150 --> 00:26:58.150
Don't fear Zuba.

00:26:58.150 --> 00:27:01.150
You can live here with us.

00:27:01.150 --> 00:27:03.150
We can all share.

00:27:03.150 --> 00:27:06.940
It's all my fault.

00:27:06.940 --> 00:27:08.940
You mustn't think that way.

00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:11.940
But I didn't give him children.

00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:16.940
With or without children, marriage is sacred.

00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:58.220
Trust in Jehovah, he will never send you away.

00:27:58.220 --> 00:28:02.460
We had a visitor last night.

00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:03.460
It was your wife.

00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:08.700
Or should I say your former wife?

00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:15.069
Reham, don't you care how you've hurt your innocent mate?

00:28:15.069 --> 00:28:17.069
How can you be so hard-hearted?

00:28:17.069 --> 00:28:20.069
Look, Moses said if you find something indecent with your wife,

00:28:20.069 --> 00:28:22.069
a man must write a certificate of divorce,

00:28:22.069 --> 00:28:24.069
hand it to her, and dismiss her.

00:28:24.069 --> 00:28:28.069
If giving me no children is an indecent, then what is?

00:28:28.069 --> 00:28:30.069
Besides, I'm tired of living with her.

00:28:30.069 --> 00:28:32.069
I'm marrying Gisla today.

00:28:32.069 --> 00:28:34.069
Gisla.

00:28:34.069 --> 00:28:37.069
That mobile girl?

00:28:37.069 --> 00:28:41.069
I heard you bind yourself with an oath and a curse not to take away from the nations.

00:28:41.069 --> 00:28:45.069
God's law says they will turn your sons away from following me

00:28:45.069 --> 00:28:46.069
to serve other gods.

00:28:46.069 --> 00:28:49.069
Then Jehovah's anger will blaze against you.

00:28:49.069 --> 00:28:51.069
Who are you to counsel me?

00:28:51.069 --> 00:28:55.069
Every man must find his own joy and I intend to find mine.

00:28:55.069 --> 00:28:59.069
Reham, only Jehovah can give true joy.

00:28:59.069 --> 00:29:03.069
Do you really think you can give yourself more joy than he can?

00:29:03.069 --> 00:29:32.150
Jehovah, why do we treat each other so treacherously, profaning your covenant?

00:29:32.150 --> 00:29:50.940
Malachi, say to the priests who are despising my name.

00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:55.940
A son honors a father and a servant his master.

00:29:55.940 --> 00:30:01.940
So if I am a father, where is the honor do me?

00:30:01.940 --> 00:30:05.940
And if I am a master, where is the fear do me?

00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:18.630
My good man.

00:30:18.630 --> 00:30:21.099
My good man.

00:30:21.099 --> 00:30:47.779
We see you have no offering to you.

00:30:47.779 --> 00:30:49.779
Why have you, Levites, despised Jehovah's name?

00:30:49.779 --> 00:30:51.779
despised it.

00:30:51.779 --> 00:30:53.779
How?

00:30:53.779 --> 00:30:59.779
You present a blind, lame or sick animal as a sacrifice and say that it is nothing bad.

00:30:59.779 --> 00:31:01.779
Should Jehovah accept it from your hand?

00:31:01.779 --> 00:31:03.779
What's the meat is in our pot?

00:31:03.779 --> 00:31:05.779
No one can tell if it was lame or sound.

00:31:05.779 --> 00:31:07.779
What about Jehovah?

00:31:07.779 --> 00:31:09.779
Can he tell the difference?

00:31:09.779 --> 00:31:12.779
One day, Jehovah will come to his temple.

00:31:12.779 --> 00:31:15.779
He will cleanse you sons of Levi by fire.

00:31:15.779 --> 00:31:17.779
Malachi, what's gotten into you?

00:31:17.779 --> 00:31:22.779
Why should you complain when everyone else approves?

00:31:22.779 --> 00:31:26.779
Oh, priests, if you refuse to take it to heart, says Jehovah,

00:31:26.779 --> 00:31:32.779
I will send on you the curse and I will turn your blessings into curses.

00:31:32.779 --> 00:31:38.779
Return to me and I will return to you, says Jehovah.

00:31:38.779 --> 00:31:40.779
How are we supposed to return?

00:31:40.779 --> 00:31:43.779
Will a mere human rob God?

00:31:43.779 --> 00:31:46.779
But you are robbing me, says Jehovah.

00:31:46.779 --> 00:31:51.779
How have we robbed him in the tithes and in the contributions you are robbing me?

00:31:51.779 --> 00:31:56.779
Yes, the entire nation is, says Jehovah, bring the entire tithe into the storehouse.

00:31:56.779 --> 00:32:00.779
So there may be food in my house and test me out, please,

00:32:00.779 --> 00:32:03.779
and see whether I will not open to you the floodgates of the heavens

00:32:03.779 --> 00:32:07.779
and pour out on you a blessing until there is nothing lacking.

00:32:07.779 --> 00:32:13.660
And there's another thing you do so that he no longer looks favorably on anything you offer.

00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:15.660
Why not?

00:32:15.660 --> 00:32:18.660
Because you betray the wife of your youth.

00:32:18.660 --> 00:32:21.660
Although she's your partner, your legal wife,

00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:26.660
there are some who don't do that because they have what remains of the spirit.

00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:29.660
So guard yourselves respecting your spirit.

00:32:29.660 --> 00:32:34.460
Do not deal treacherously with the wife of your youth.

00:32:34.460 --> 00:32:39.460
For I hate divorce, says Jehovah, the God of Israel.

00:32:39.460 --> 00:32:42.460
The lips of a priest should safeguard knowledge

00:32:42.460 --> 00:32:45.460
and people should seek the law from his mouth.

00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:49.460
But you, you have made many stumble.

00:32:49.460 --> 00:33:02.059
Jehovah's message revealed the problem was in their hearts.

00:33:02.059 --> 00:33:10.109
In spite of that, Malachi sought out those who found joy in doing what was right.

00:33:10.109 --> 00:33:24.599
Pilate, how are you?

00:33:24.599 --> 00:33:27.599
Azuba, don't despair.

00:33:27.599 --> 00:33:32.599
You will see the distinction between the righteous and the wicked.

00:33:32.599 --> 00:33:36.599
Between one who serves God and one who doesn't.

00:33:36.599 --> 00:33:38.599
You must be a prophet.

00:33:38.599 --> 00:33:40.599
I serve Jehovah as you do.

00:33:40.599 --> 00:33:44.599
And I can tell you that when you speak with one another about Jehovah,

00:33:44.599 --> 00:33:47.599
he pays attention.

00:33:47.599 --> 00:33:50.599
A book is written before him of those who fear him

00:33:50.599 --> 00:33:56.220
and meditate on his name.

00:33:56.220 --> 00:34:12.619
May Jehovah be with you.

00:34:12.619 --> 00:34:16.619
For years, I was away from Jerusalem.

00:34:16.619 --> 00:34:19.619
But my heart was always with my people.

00:34:19.619 --> 00:34:22.619
I requested to return to them.

00:34:22.619 --> 00:34:25.619
But what I found shocked me.

00:34:25.619 --> 00:34:29.219
A lie ship.

00:34:29.219 --> 00:34:30.219
May you have peace.

00:34:30.219 --> 00:34:32.219
Yeah, Maya.

00:34:32.219 --> 00:34:34.219
I wasn't expecting it.

00:34:34.219 --> 00:34:36.219
Where are the Levites and the Singers?

00:34:36.219 --> 00:34:39.219
Some of them are away right now.

00:34:39.219 --> 00:34:40.219
Away?

00:34:40.219 --> 00:34:42.219
Why are they away?

00:34:42.219 --> 00:34:46.039
Padaya is here.

00:34:46.039 --> 00:34:49.039
Padaya showed Governor Nehemiah around.

00:34:49.039 --> 00:34:54.690
Excuse me, please.

00:34:54.690 --> 00:34:56.690
Of course.

00:34:56.690 --> 00:35:04.869
Padaya, tell me about the temple services.

00:35:04.869 --> 00:35:06.869
Do you have all the provisions that you need?

00:35:06.869 --> 00:35:09.869
Governor Nehemiah, we have nearly no provisions at all.

00:35:09.869 --> 00:35:10.869
How can that be?

00:35:10.869 --> 00:35:15.869
For a long time, the priests and the Levites have not taken their duties seriously.

00:35:15.869 --> 00:35:18.869
When the people saw that, they stopped bringing in tithes.

00:35:18.869 --> 00:35:23.869
Without the tithes, most Levites and singers return to their fields.

00:35:23.869 --> 00:35:26.869
Why have you not returned?

00:35:26.869 --> 00:35:28.869
My Lord, I'm getting by.

00:35:28.869 --> 00:35:32.869
I've always believed that Jehovah helps those who trust in him.

00:35:32.869 --> 00:35:35.869
I know he will correct things in his time.

00:35:35.869 --> 00:35:39.869
Did Alayashib not tell the people to bring your provisions?

00:35:39.869 --> 00:35:44.869
In your absence, the prophet Malachi warned him and all the priests.

00:35:44.869 --> 00:35:50.869
But Alayashib, he took our storeroom, emptied it of our provisions.

00:35:50.869 --> 00:35:53.869
He gave it to Baya to use as a dining hall.

00:35:53.869 --> 00:36:08.860
Padaya, help us get rid of these things.

00:36:08.860 --> 00:36:16.820
What are you doing?

00:36:16.820 --> 00:36:20.340
Alayashib!

00:36:20.340 --> 00:36:22.340
What have you been doing?

00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:25.340
Why have you in the deputy rulers neglected the House of God?

00:36:25.340 --> 00:36:30.340
You and they please cleanse this room and replace the utensils.

00:36:30.340 --> 00:36:31.340
Yes, ma'am.

00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:34.340
And gather all the Levites, the singers, the deputy rulers to me.

00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:36.340
I'm assigning them all back to their posts.

00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:41.340
Padaya, I'm placing you, Shalomai, and Zadok in charge of the storeroom.

00:36:41.340 --> 00:36:42.340
Hainan will be your assistant.

00:36:42.340 --> 00:36:45.340
It's your responsibility to distribute provisions to your brothers.

00:36:45.340 --> 00:36:46.340
Yes, ma'am.

00:36:46.340 --> 00:36:48.340
Wait a second.

00:36:48.340 --> 00:36:49.340
Let me explain.

00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:53.340
I will tell all Judah to bring in the tent of the grain,

00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:56.340
the new wine, and the oil.

00:36:56.340 --> 00:36:59.340
I can expose.

00:36:59.340 --> 00:37:01.340
No, no way.

00:37:01.340 --> 00:37:16.090
Do remember me, oh my God.

00:37:16.090 --> 00:37:21.090
Do not wipe out my acts of loyal love for the House of my God.

00:37:21.090 --> 00:37:30.590
Not only have they neglected Jehovah's House,

00:37:30.590 --> 00:37:33.590
some of the Jews continued to conduct business on the Sabbath.

00:37:33.590 --> 00:37:38.260
A day Jehovah had declared as holy.

00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:43.260
What are you selling today?

00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:48.260
Only the best quality fish from tired.

00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:49.260
What are you doing?

00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:51.260
Do you not care that this is the Sabbath?

00:37:51.260 --> 00:37:53.260
Nehemiah.

00:37:53.260 --> 00:37:58.750
What is this evil thing you're doing?

00:37:58.750 --> 00:38:00.750
That's why God brought disaster on the city.

00:38:00.750 --> 00:38:02.750
People think it's acceptable now.

00:38:02.750 --> 00:38:05.750
What does Jehovah think?

00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:09.750
I stopped the buying and selling and ordered the doors closed

00:38:09.750 --> 00:38:20.469
so as to keep the Sabbath day holy.

00:38:20.469 --> 00:38:26.199
But the following week, the merchants try it again.

00:38:26.199 --> 00:38:28.199
What's the meaning of this?

00:38:28.199 --> 00:38:30.199
I had to sleep on the ground last night.

00:38:30.199 --> 00:38:32.199
You know God's law.

00:38:32.199 --> 00:38:33.199
No work.

00:38:33.199 --> 00:38:34.199
No business.

00:38:34.199 --> 00:38:36.199
On the Sabbath.

00:38:36.199 --> 00:38:37.199
Go.

00:38:37.199 --> 00:38:40.199
You know the Levites guard the gates and keep the Sabbath holy.

00:38:40.199 --> 00:38:42.199
Don't let anyone in.

00:38:42.199 --> 00:38:52.739
This too.

00:38:52.739 --> 00:38:55.739
Remember to my credit, oh my God.

00:38:55.739 --> 00:38:59.739
And show me pity according to your abundant loyal love.

00:38:59.739 --> 00:39:07.099
There was another thing that I had to do.

00:39:07.099 --> 00:39:12.360
Come back here.

00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:15.360
You have to listen to me. I'm your father.

00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:17.360
What's wrong with your children?

00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:20.360
They don't like coming to the temple.

00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:22.360
Oh, sweetie.

00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:24.360
Why don't you like it?

00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:26.360
So who gets it?

00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:32.329
Come back here now.

00:39:32.329 --> 00:39:33.329
I'm sorry, my lord.

00:39:33.329 --> 00:39:35.329
My wife speaks very little Hebrew.

00:39:35.329 --> 00:39:38.800
Did you not swear?

00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:41.800
Never to marry someone who doesn't serve Jehovah?

00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:43.800
My God, nobody cares.

00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:45.800
Did you not?

00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:46.800
Yes.

00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:47.800
Yes.

00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:49.800
Why have you ignored the command of Jehovah?

00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:51.800
And you're a whole no.

00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:52.800
Let me go.

00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:55.800
No wonder your children don't love Jehovah.

00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:59.800
Did you imagine that you could succeed without Jehovah's blessing?

00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:01.800
I prayed for Jehovah's blessing.

00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:02.800
Did you?

00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:04.800
But you didn't obey him.

00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:05.800
Rahim.

00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:12.360
How can Jehovah bless something that is against his will?

00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:14.360
I was I surprised.

00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:18.360
The people were just following the bad example of those taking the lead.

00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:22.360
Eliaship's grandson married to Horonite.

00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:33.989
The daughter of Sin Ballet.

00:40:33.989 --> 00:40:38.340
Have you no respect for God's law?

00:40:38.340 --> 00:40:40.340
You should not give your daughters their sons.

00:40:40.340 --> 00:40:44.340
Nor accept any of their daughters for your sons.

00:40:44.340 --> 00:40:47.840
Or yourselves.

00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:53.690
Was it not because of these that King Solomon sinned?

00:40:53.690 --> 00:40:55.690
Grandfather, say something.

00:40:55.690 --> 00:40:56.690
Be still in my son.

00:40:56.690 --> 00:41:02.690
Is it not something unheard of for you to commit this great evil by marrying foreign women?

00:41:02.690 --> 00:41:11.320
You have to file the priesthood.

00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:13.320
You may not serve as a priest.

00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:15.320
Nor remain in Jerusalem.

00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:21.670
Fine.

00:41:21.670 --> 00:41:23.670
I'll go to Samaria.

00:41:23.670 --> 00:41:25.670
They're more tolerant there.

00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:32.449
But he's my grandson.

00:41:32.449 --> 00:41:37.860
Then why did you allow him to disregard Jehovah's laws?

00:41:37.860 --> 00:41:39.860
You know.

00:41:39.860 --> 00:41:44.860
Our temple services are what preserves our relationship with God.

00:41:44.860 --> 00:41:47.860
But as soon as I left,

00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:52.619
all of you, you let it fall apart.

00:41:52.619 --> 00:42:06.070
It took some time,

00:42:06.070 --> 00:42:10.070
but true worship was restored.

00:42:10.070 --> 00:42:31.989
When I look back on all that Jehovah enabled us to do,

00:42:31.989 --> 00:42:34.989
despite the opposition we faced,

00:42:34.989 --> 00:42:39.989
I recommend we turn the accusation of this edition against Nehemiah.

00:42:39.989 --> 00:42:43.989
Next sound they hear will be our battle cry.

00:42:43.989 --> 00:42:46.989
Are you gonna wait until they start killing us?

00:42:46.989 --> 00:42:48.989
The bad influences we avoided.

00:42:48.989 --> 00:42:51.989
I have a right to live where I choose, and so do you.

00:42:51.989 --> 00:42:53.989
I need you to join me in refusing to move.

00:42:53.989 --> 00:42:55.989
Don't waste your money. Be practical.

00:42:55.989 --> 00:42:57.989
Besides, it's only a tradition.

00:42:57.989 --> 00:43:01.989
If we want to eat, we need to attend our own flocks and fields.

00:43:01.989 --> 00:43:03.989
It's of no value to serve God.

00:43:03.989 --> 00:43:05.989
The sleepless nights.

00:43:05.989 --> 00:43:08.989
We must go to Jerusalem to keep an eye on Nehemiah.

00:43:08.989 --> 00:43:10.989
Don't you see these people hate what we're doing?

00:43:10.989 --> 00:43:11.989
They hate us.

00:43:11.989 --> 00:43:14.989
They have to live and work around them like we do.

00:43:14.989 --> 00:43:16.989
The sweat and toil.

00:43:16.989 --> 00:43:18.989
Besides, this work is too much for us.

00:43:18.989 --> 00:43:21.989
We're worn out. Why do we need a wall anyway?

00:43:21.989 --> 00:43:24.989
I just remember the joy we felt.

00:43:24.989 --> 00:43:29.369
Because we were serving Jehovah the right way.

00:43:29.369 --> 00:43:34.289
We thought we were just working on a wall.

00:43:34.289 --> 00:43:47.659
Jehovah was rebuilding our faith.

00:43:47.659 --> 00:43:50.659
I'll never forget how Jehovah brought us together

00:43:50.659 --> 00:43:52.659
to accomplish his will.

00:43:52.659 --> 00:43:57.019
He taught us to rely on him.

00:43:57.019 --> 00:44:02.159
He strengthened us.

00:44:02.159 --> 00:44:04.159
Eat the choice things.

00:44:04.159 --> 00:44:06.159
And drink what is sweet.

00:44:06.159 --> 00:44:08.159
And send portion to those who have nothing.

00:44:08.159 --> 00:44:10.159
And do not feel sad.

00:44:10.159 --> 00:44:14.159
For the joy of Jehovah is your stronghold.

00:44:14.159 --> 00:44:26.780
Do remember me favorably.

00:44:26.780 --> 00:44:28.780
Oh my God.

00:44:28.780 --> 00:44:43.579
Nehemiah was a man of courage.

00:44:43.579 --> 00:44:47.579
He could have stayed in the luxurious palace of Shushan

00:44:47.579 --> 00:44:49.579
and served Jehovah from there.

00:44:49.579 --> 00:44:51.579
But he didn't.

00:44:51.579 --> 00:44:55.579
When Anita rose, he was ready to make the long journey

00:44:55.579 --> 00:44:59.579
to Jerusalem to support his brothers.

00:44:59.579 --> 00:45:01.579
But it wouldn't be easy.

00:45:01.579 --> 00:45:05.579
First he had to ask the king of Persia to let him go.

00:45:05.579 --> 00:45:09.579
What helped Nehemiah to be a courageous person for Jehovah?

00:45:09.579 --> 00:45:14.579
Did he rely on his personality or his good record with the king?

00:45:14.579 --> 00:45:16.579
Let's watch this part again.

00:45:16.579 --> 00:45:22.019
The place where my forefathers are buried lies in ruins.

00:45:22.019 --> 00:45:24.019
And its gates have been consumed by fire.

00:45:24.019 --> 00:45:26.019
Nehemiah, what is this?

00:45:26.019 --> 00:45:28.019
Speak frankly, what are you seeking?

00:45:28.019 --> 00:45:33.719
At once I prayed to the God of the heavens.

00:45:33.719 --> 00:45:38.949
If it pleases the king.

00:45:38.949 --> 00:45:42.949
And if your servant has found favor with you.

00:45:42.949 --> 00:45:48.940
Send me to Judah to the city where my forefathers are buried.

00:45:48.940 --> 00:45:50.940
And let me rebuild it.

00:45:50.940 --> 00:45:59.369
You may go.

00:45:59.369 --> 00:46:01.369
Jehovah was with us.

00:46:01.369 --> 00:46:08.860
Nehemiah immediately and humbly prayed to Jehovah.

00:46:08.860 --> 00:46:10.860
The true source of courage.

00:46:10.860 --> 00:46:14.860
In fact, he prayed repeatedly throughout his assignment.

00:46:14.860 --> 00:46:18.860
And Jehovah blessed his efforts.

00:46:18.860 --> 00:46:22.860
So lesson number one for us today.

00:46:22.860 --> 00:46:26.860
When times are hard, we may be quick to lean on Jehovah.

00:46:26.860 --> 00:46:28.860
But what if things are going well?

00:46:28.860 --> 00:46:32.860
Are we still reliant on Jehovah?

00:46:32.860 --> 00:46:36.860
Or might we find ourselves becoming complacent?

00:46:36.860 --> 00:46:40.860
Perhaps even saying things are good in my life now.

00:46:40.860 --> 00:46:44.860
I know there's a need to get to work.

00:46:44.860 --> 00:46:48.860
But I've been serving Jehovah for many years now.

00:46:48.860 --> 00:46:50.860
I've done my part.

00:46:50.860 --> 00:46:52.860
Let someone else do it.

00:46:52.860 --> 00:46:56.860
Will Jehovah bless such an attitude?

00:46:56.860 --> 00:47:00.860
Wouldn't it be better to turn to Jehovah in prayer?

00:47:00.860 --> 00:47:06.860
Asking him to give you the courage and joy to continue to reach out

00:47:06.860 --> 00:47:08.860
in your service to him?

00:47:08.860 --> 00:47:16.860
You just might be surprised at the door Jehovah opens for you.

00:47:16.860 --> 00:47:22.860
Now, once Nehemiah arrived in Jerusalem, he didn't just give orders, did he?

00:47:22.860 --> 00:47:28.860
The Bible says that he daily worked alongside his fellow Israelites

00:47:28.860 --> 00:47:32.860
from the break of dawn until the stars came out.

00:47:32.860 --> 00:47:37.860
In a similar way, when we show a self-sacrificing spirit,

00:47:37.860 --> 00:47:43.860
Jehovah will give us the energy needed to carry out the task at hand.

00:47:43.860 --> 00:47:49.860
The Israelites completed the wall building project in just 52 days.

00:47:49.860 --> 00:47:57.860
What an amazing feat, especially in the face of continual opposition.

00:47:57.860 --> 00:48:01.860
At first, it came in the form of mocking.

00:48:01.860 --> 00:48:05.860
Then the opposers threatened to attack.

00:48:05.860 --> 00:48:09.860
There were Samaritans in the North, Ammonites in East,

00:48:09.860 --> 00:48:14.860
Arabs in the South, and Ashtadites in the West.

00:48:14.860 --> 00:48:18.860
Jerusalem was surrounded by enemies.

00:48:18.860 --> 00:48:22.860
It could have been easy to feel trapped and to give in to fear.

00:48:22.860 --> 00:48:24.860
What did Nehemiah do?

00:48:24.860 --> 00:48:27.860
Well, what was his pattern?

00:48:27.860 --> 00:48:29.860
In his own words, he says,

00:48:29.860 --> 00:48:33.860
we prayed to our God.

00:48:33.860 --> 00:48:37.860
Then Nehemiah strengthened the people by telling them

00:48:37.860 --> 00:48:41.860
do not be afraid of them.

00:48:41.860 --> 00:48:46.860
Remember Jehovah, who is great and awe-inspiring.

00:48:46.860 --> 00:48:49.860
And so they kept building.

00:48:49.860 --> 00:48:53.860
After Nehemiah's enemies realized that their open threats had failed,

00:48:53.860 --> 00:48:55.860
did they give up?

00:48:55.860 --> 00:48:56.860
No.

00:48:56.860 --> 00:49:00.860
They now turn to other forms of opposition.

00:49:00.860 --> 00:49:07.860
In fact, they tried three different schemes to sidetrack Nehemiah from the work.

00:49:07.860 --> 00:49:09.860
Did you notice them?

00:49:09.860 --> 00:49:11.860
Let's watch the video again.

00:49:11.860 --> 00:49:20.809
They asked to meet Nehemiah halfway.

00:49:20.809 --> 00:49:23.809
Tell this to Nehemiah.

00:49:23.809 --> 00:49:24.809
Come.

00:49:24.809 --> 00:49:29.809
And let us set a time to meet together in the valley plain of Ono.

00:49:29.809 --> 00:49:36.170
They're trying to lure me away from Jerusalem to do the harm.

00:49:36.170 --> 00:49:39.170
They spread false rumors.

00:49:39.170 --> 00:49:43.170
Geesham, it's time to implement your plan.

00:49:43.170 --> 00:49:47.170
Tobiah, write this down.

00:49:47.170 --> 00:49:50.170
Among the nations, it has been heard.

00:49:50.170 --> 00:49:59.170
And Geesham is also saying that you and the Jews are scheming to rebel.

00:49:59.170 --> 00:50:02.170
That is why you are building the wall.

00:50:02.170 --> 00:50:07.860
And they used a traitor to try and trick Nehemiah.

00:50:07.860 --> 00:50:09.860
They're coming to kill you.

00:50:09.860 --> 00:50:14.860
By night, we must go into the temple and close the doors.

00:50:14.860 --> 00:50:17.860
Shemaah, should a man like me run away?

00:50:17.860 --> 00:50:19.860
You don't understand.

00:50:19.860 --> 00:50:22.860
What would that do to the spirit of the entire nation?

00:50:22.860 --> 00:50:24.860
It's the only safe place.

00:50:24.860 --> 00:50:27.860
Besides, I'm not a priest.

00:50:27.860 --> 00:50:30.860
If I entered the temple, that would be valid reason to kill me.

00:50:30.860 --> 00:50:33.860
I will not go in.

00:50:33.860 --> 00:50:35.860
That decision would be foolish, Nehemiah.

00:50:35.860 --> 00:50:44.389
Oh, I see.

00:50:44.389 --> 00:50:47.389
Tobiah and San Ballet put you up to this.

00:50:47.389 --> 00:50:49.389
Didn't they, you hypocrite?

00:50:49.389 --> 00:50:51.389
Made Jehovah remember them?

00:50:51.389 --> 00:50:55.389
And all of you false prophets who keep trying to frighten me.

00:50:55.389 --> 00:50:57.389
Come here, Nehemiah.

00:50:57.389 --> 00:50:58.389
We have work to do.

00:50:58.389 --> 00:51:04.739
Three schemes.

00:51:04.739 --> 00:51:06.739
Three failures.

00:51:06.739 --> 00:51:08.739
So lesson number two.

00:51:08.739 --> 00:51:17.739
Like Nehemiah, we might encounter opposers who scheme to bring our loyal service to a halt.

00:51:17.739 --> 00:51:21.739
Some may invite us to meet them halfway, so to speak.

00:51:21.739 --> 00:51:27.739
They may try to convince us that if we served Jehovah with just a little less zeal,

00:51:27.739 --> 00:51:32.739
we could pursue worldly goals at the same time.

00:51:32.739 --> 00:51:36.739
However, because God's kingdom comes first in our lives,

00:51:36.739 --> 00:51:40.739
we can be like Nehemiah and refuse to compromise.

00:51:40.739 --> 00:51:43.739
We know where this world's headed.

00:51:43.739 --> 00:51:49.599
Opposers also spread false accusations against us.

00:51:49.599 --> 00:51:54.599
In some lands, we're accused of posing a threat to the state.

00:51:54.599 --> 00:51:58.599
Some accusations have been successfully rebutted in court.

00:51:58.599 --> 00:52:06.599
But whatever the outcome, we're confident that Jehovah will direct matters according to his will.

00:52:06.599 --> 00:52:12.599
Opposition may also come from those who pretend to serve Jehovah.

00:52:12.599 --> 00:52:18.599
Just as a fellow Jew tried to get Nehemiah to break God's law to save his life,

00:52:18.599 --> 00:52:25.599
so former witnesses may try to get us to compromise in one way or another.

00:52:25.599 --> 00:52:31.599
However, we reject apostates because we know that our lives are saved,

00:52:31.599 --> 00:52:36.599
not by breaking God's laws, but by keeping them.

00:52:36.599 --> 00:52:42.599
Each time Nehemiah refused to fall into their trap, why?

00:52:42.599 --> 00:52:45.599
Because he had a brilliant mind? No.

00:52:45.599 --> 00:52:53.599
It was because he relied on Jehovah and Jehovah gave him the insight needed

00:52:53.599 --> 00:52:57.599
to see through their deceptions.

00:52:57.599 --> 00:53:01.599
After the walls built, Nehemiah left Jerusalem for a while.

00:53:01.599 --> 00:53:05.599
But what did he find on his return?

00:53:05.599 --> 00:53:12.599
Instead of coming back to find true worship thriving, he found it barely surviving.

00:53:12.599 --> 00:53:18.599
All the work that he had done to help the people to trust Jehovah.

00:53:18.599 --> 00:53:21.599
How do you think he felt?

00:53:21.599 --> 00:53:25.599
He could have said, that's it. I'm out.

00:53:25.599 --> 00:53:29.599
Let someone else clean this up and walk away.

00:53:29.599 --> 00:53:33.599
But did he? Let's watch again.

00:53:33.599 --> 00:53:36.599
Why have you and the deputy rulers neglected the House of God?

00:53:36.599 --> 00:53:39.599
You and they please cleanse this room.

00:53:39.599 --> 00:53:45.599
You know God's law. No work. No business on the Sabbath.

00:53:45.599 --> 00:53:47.599
Go!

00:53:47.599 --> 00:53:52.599
Did you not swear? Never to marry someone who doesn't serve Jehovah?

00:53:52.599 --> 00:53:57.599
Then why have you ignored the command of Jehovah and your own oath?

00:53:57.599 --> 00:54:03.599
Also, the Liarship's grandson married a Hora Knight. The daughter of San Ballet.

00:54:03.599 --> 00:54:11.190
You should not give your daughters their sons, nor accept any of their daughters for your sons.

00:54:11.190 --> 00:54:18.190
You have to file the priesthood. You may not serve as a priest, nor remain in Jerusalem.

00:54:18.190 --> 00:54:24.190
It took some time, but true worship was restored.

00:54:24.190 --> 00:54:32.090
Nehemiah didn't walk away, did he?

00:54:32.090 --> 00:54:36.090
No, he persevered in his assignment. Why?

00:54:36.090 --> 00:54:40.090
Because he held on to his joy.

00:54:40.090 --> 00:54:46.090
You see, his main source of joy came not from his accomplishments,

00:54:46.090 --> 00:54:52.090
not from the security of walls, nor even from what others were doing.

00:54:52.090 --> 00:54:56.090
From where does true joy come?

00:54:56.090 --> 00:55:04.090
Nehemiah himself told us, the joy of Jehovah is your stronghold.

00:55:04.090 --> 00:55:07.090
So here's lesson number three for us.

00:55:07.090 --> 00:55:16.090
Despite challenges and setbacks, we can be joyful because true joy comes from a good relationship with Jehovah.

00:55:16.090 --> 00:55:19.090
Nehemiah was a man like you and me.

00:55:19.090 --> 00:55:27.090
Remember, he didn't have Jehovah's power displayed supernaturally to him like Moses and Joshua did.

00:55:27.090 --> 00:55:29.090
But what did he have?

00:55:29.090 --> 00:55:33.090
He had prayer. He had faith.

00:55:33.090 --> 00:55:38.090
And he had trust. Those were his tools.

00:55:38.090 --> 00:55:45.090
And there's no doubt that Jehovah was active on behalf of Nehemiah, guiding and blessing his efforts.

00:55:46.090 --> 00:55:50.090
We have those same tools today.

00:55:50.090 --> 00:55:57.090
Pray to Jehovah, put faith in him, and trust that he will bless your self-sacrificing efforts.

00:55:57.090 --> 00:56:06.090
Just as Jehovah gave Nehemiah the courage, the energy, the insight, and the perseverance to carry out his assignment,

00:56:06.090 --> 00:56:09.090
he'll do the same for you.

00:56:11.849 --> 00:56:17.849
Like Nehemiah, we gain strength from our association with faithful fellow believers.

00:56:17.849 --> 00:56:24.849
Likewise, our next song draws attention to the blessings we enjoy as a united brotherhood.

00:56:24.849 --> 00:56:28.849
The song is entitled, We Are Jehovah's Army.

00:56:28.849 --> 00:56:33.849
Let's stand and sing together song number 71.

00:56:33.849 --> 00:56:37.849
After the song, you may remain standing for any announcements.

00:56:37.849 --> 00:56:40.849
Again, that song number 71.
