00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:08.019
I was born deaf, and I attended a school for the deaf.

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:11.019
Later, I attended college.

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:17.269
While I was there, I noticed that my vision was deteriorating

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:19.269
and I couldn't understand why.

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:22.269
I was informed that I was going blind.

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:24.269
I was stunned.

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.269
I was also given an article, and in the article,

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:31.269
I noticed one sentence that said,

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:35.270
deaf blind people are the loneliest people in the world.

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.549
I was devastated.

00:00:38.549 --> 00:00:44.880
Being both deaf and blind is challenging.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:49.799
I've had to learn how to live independently,

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:54.659
but the most important thing that I've learned

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:59.659
is learning about Jehovah, the true God.

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:09.659
Some people might imagine that a deaf blind person

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.659
would be too limited to serve Jehovah fully.

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:16.659
That's far from the truth.

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:19.659
Let me give you some examples of my service.

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:22.659
Some of the ways that I support the congregation

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:29.230
are by attending meetings, being regular in service.

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:32.230
Sometimes, I can be helpful in training others

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:35.230
how to be more effective teachers.

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:39.230
I often join others on their Bible studies.

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.230
I've been able to pioneer for many years,

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.230
and this is something that I really enjoy.

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:49.959
Over the years, my husband and I

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:53.959
have had the opportunity to preach in many countries.

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:55.959
In some of the countries,

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:58.959
the deaf ministry was just getting started.

00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:03.959
For example, we went to Honduras in Central America.

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:06.959
They only had two small groups.

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:09.960
We first went for a few months,

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.960
then returned and stayed for a year.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.960
What a great experience to participate

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.960
and see the growth in the field.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.879
Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic,

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:24.879
I was accustomed to being a self-sufficient person.

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:29.879
For example, I could go out on my own with my guide dog.

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:33.879
We could go to the Kingdom Hall to meet the brothers and sisters.

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:38.289
But then, COVID-19 hit.

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:45.780
And I was stuck at home, isolated.

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.780
While it's true that we still had meetings

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.780
and service arrangements on Zoom,

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.780
it wasn't easy.

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:58.280
The only person who could interpret for me was my husband.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.280
No one else.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.280
It was tough.

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.280
He was exhausted.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.280
We both were.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.069
It was something we had to endure.

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:15.069
In time, when it became safe enough,

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:18.069
a few of the brothers and sisters volunteered to come

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:21.069
and help interpret.

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:24.069
That really built me up.

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:29.069
I could finally have direct contact with my friends.

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:32.069
I was thrilled.

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:36.069
I also receive a lot of support from the congregation.

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:39.069
There are many willing volunteers to tactile interpret for me

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:41.069
at the meetings.

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:43.069
That gives me joy.

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:46.069
I always know that if I have a problem,

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:49.069
I can share my thoughts and feelings with others.

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:54.759
They will listen and support me.

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:57.759
No matter what the future brings.

00:03:57.759 --> 00:04:02.759
I remember the scripture at Isaiah 41-10.

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:04.759
It says,

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:08.759
Do not be afraid for I am with you.

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:11.759
I know that Jehovah encourages me.

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:14.759
He will help me.

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:20.339
I don't have to worry.

00:04:20.339 --> 00:04:23.339
While it's true that I'm deaf and blind,

00:04:23.339 --> 00:04:26.339
I'm not one of the loneliest people in the world.

00:04:26.339 --> 00:04:32.139
I'm a happy person because I have many friends.

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:37.139
I have the joy of helping others to learn about God.

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:41.139
And I have the best friend ever.

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:43.139
Jehovah.
