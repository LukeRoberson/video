00:00:01.679 --> 00:00:09.679
Traveling through Central Italy, one can see many cities that have been built on the top of mountains rather than in a valley.

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:15.679
In past centuries, this was often for strategic reasons, in case of war.

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:18.679
Such cities were easier to defend.

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:24.679
As you travel in the valleys now, you can see these cities from afar.

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:31.679
This reminds us of Jesus' statements at Matthew 5, 14 to 16.

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.679
In verse 14, he said,

00:00:33.679 --> 00:00:37.679
A city cannot be hid when located on the mountain.

00:00:37.679 --> 00:00:39.679
Jesus also said,

00:00:39.679 --> 00:00:42.679
You are the light of the world.

00:00:42.679 --> 00:00:46.679
People light a lamp and set it not under a basket,

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:51.679
but on a lamp stand and it shines on all those in the house.

00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:56.679
Likewise, let your light shine before men.

00:00:56.679 --> 00:01:00.679
In ancient Israel, oil lamps illuminated the homes,

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:05.680
and the oil lamp was often kept burning throughout the night.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.680
Light is used in the Bible in a figurative way.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.680
Sometimes it is associated with truth.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.680
Some 43 verse 3 says,

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.680
Send out your light and your truth.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.680
May these lead me.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.680
May they guide me to your holy mountain and to your grand tabernacle.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.680
Similarly, light is associated with God's Word.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.680
Some 19 verse 105 says,

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:39.680
Your Word is a lamp to my foot and a light for my path.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.680
Proverbs 6, 23 reads,

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.680
The commandment is a lamp and the law is a light.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:53.680
Also, progressively righteous conduct is compared to light.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.680
Proverbs 4, 18 says,

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.680
But the path of the righteous is like the bright morning light

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.680
that grows brighter and brighter until full daylight.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.680
Even people are compared to light.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.680
Remember, Jesus said,

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.680
You are the light of the world.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:18.680
So it is we as individuals that become the light of the world by what we do.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.680
This is in harmony with His statement at John 8 verse 12,

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.680
I am the light of the world.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.680
How do we let the light shine?

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.680
First, many understand that it means preaching the good news.

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.680
Well, this is certainly one very important way of letting the light shine.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.680
Certainly, preaching and teaching is a fine work.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.680
To the Romans, Paul wrote in the Romans 15 verse 16,

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:55.680
I am engaging in the holy work of the good news of God.

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.680
But preaching is not the only way to let the light shine.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.680
What other ways can we let our light shine?

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.680
When Jesus said, Let your light shine,

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.680
He was not specifically referring to preaching,

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.680
but to doing good to others by neighborly love.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.680
He said in verse 16 of Matthew chapter 5,

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.680
So that the people may see you find works

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.680
and give glory to your Father who is in the heavens.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:32.680
Jesus said that it is by fine works that will let our light shine.

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:38.680
This is in line with Isaiah 58 verses 7 and 8,

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.680
where it says,

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.680
It is to share your bread with the hungry,

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.680
to bring the poor and homeless into your house,

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.680
to close someone naked when you see him,

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.680
and not to turn your back on your own flesh.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.680
Then your light will shine through like the dawn.

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.819
Jesus as the light of the world did both.

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:07.819
He led his light shine by means of preaching,

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:11.819
but he also did so by means of doing fine works,

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:13.819
doing good to others.

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:19.819
Like Jesus, we let the light shine also by our Christian conduct.

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:22.819
Jesus kept perfect balance.

00:04:22.819 --> 00:04:27.819
We too need to balance our preaching with doing good to others

00:04:27.819 --> 00:04:30.819
and displaying Christian conduct.

00:04:30.819 --> 00:04:34.819
Jehovah's Witnesses everywhere are known for their honesty.

00:04:34.819 --> 00:04:39.819
They imitate the Apostle Paul who said at Hebrews 13, 18,

00:04:39.819 --> 00:04:42.819
We trust we have an honest conscience

00:04:42.819 --> 00:04:48.819
as we wish to conduct ourselves honestly in all things.

00:04:48.819 --> 00:04:52.819
They appreciate that such conduct gives glory to Jehovah God,

00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:54.819
as Jesus said.

00:04:54.819 --> 00:04:57.819
Jehovah is the best example.

00:04:57.819 --> 00:05:01.819
In Eden, he proclaimed the good news that Satan would be crushed,

00:05:01.819 --> 00:05:05.819
resulting in paradise restored to earth.

00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:08.819
He proclaimed the good news to Abraham,

00:05:08.819 --> 00:05:12.819
that through Abraham all the nations will be blessed.

00:05:12.819 --> 00:05:15.819
But besides declaring the good news,

00:05:15.819 --> 00:05:20.819
he also constantly does good to mankind.

00:05:21.819 --> 00:05:26.819
At Acts chapter 14 verse 16 and 17,

00:05:26.819 --> 00:05:28.819
to people in Listera,

00:05:28.819 --> 00:05:32.819
Asia Minor, Paul and Barnabas said,

00:05:32.819 --> 00:05:34.819
In past generations,

00:05:34.819 --> 00:05:38.819
he permitted all the nations to go on in their ways,

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:41.819
although he did not leave himself without witness,

00:05:41.819 --> 00:05:44.819
in that he did good,

00:05:44.819 --> 00:05:48.819
giving you rains from heaven and fruitful seasons,

00:05:48.819 --> 00:05:53.819
satisfying you with food and filling your hearts with gladness.

00:05:53.819 --> 00:05:58.069
Jesus is a perfect example as well.

00:05:58.069 --> 00:06:01.069
Jesus not only preached and taught,

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:04.069
but he also did good to others.

00:06:04.069 --> 00:06:08.069
He healed the lame, the blind, and the demon possessed.

00:06:08.069 --> 00:06:10.069
Acts 10.38 says,

00:06:10.069 --> 00:06:13.069
He went through the land doing good

00:06:13.069 --> 00:06:16.069
and healing all those oppressed by the devil,

00:06:16.069 --> 00:06:19.069
because God was with him.

00:06:19.069 --> 00:06:22.069
On one occasion, after preaching to a crowd,

00:06:22.069 --> 00:06:26.069
Jesus twice performed the miracle of feeding thousands

00:06:26.069 --> 00:06:29.069
with some fish and a few loaves of bread.

00:06:29.069 --> 00:06:33.069
He did not stop at preaching to the crowds.

00:06:33.069 --> 00:06:37.069
He did good to them by giving them food.

00:06:37.069 --> 00:06:42.069
We can also imitate him by giving food to those who are hungry.

00:06:42.069 --> 00:06:46.069
Can you children also do good to other children,

00:06:46.069 --> 00:06:48.069
besides preaching to them?

00:06:48.069 --> 00:06:52.069
Yes, perhaps you can share some snacks with others

00:06:52.069 --> 00:06:54.069
that might not have brought any to school,

00:06:54.069 --> 00:06:59.069
or whose parents are too poor to provide them with such.

00:06:59.069 --> 00:07:01.069
Or perhaps you have a nice piece of clothing

00:07:01.069 --> 00:07:04.069
that has become too small for you to wear.

00:07:04.069 --> 00:07:08.069
Perhaps you can give it as a gift to someone in your class

00:07:08.069 --> 00:07:10.069
or school that might have a need for it.

00:07:10.069 --> 00:07:14.319
Let's go back to letting our light shine

00:07:14.319 --> 00:07:17.319
by showing neighborly love.

00:07:17.319 --> 00:07:21.319
Let's first consider good works in the congregation.

00:07:21.319 --> 00:07:24.319
Many brothers let their light shine today

00:07:24.319 --> 00:07:27.319
when they visit sick brothers and sisters,

00:07:27.319 --> 00:07:31.319
encourage the depressed and support the week.

00:07:31.319 --> 00:07:36.319
In Hebrews 1350, the Apostle Paul compares our public declaration

00:07:36.319 --> 00:07:39.319
of Jehovah's name to a sacrifice.

00:07:39.319 --> 00:07:41.319
He says, through him,

00:07:41.319 --> 00:07:46.319
let us always offer to God a sacrifice of praise,

00:07:46.319 --> 00:07:52.319
that is, the fruit of lips that make public declaration to His name.

00:07:52.319 --> 00:07:54.319
That includes preaching.

00:07:54.319 --> 00:07:58.319
However, in the very next verse, verse 16,

00:07:58.319 --> 00:08:02.319
he speaks of something else as also being a sacrifice,

00:08:02.319 --> 00:08:04.319
besides preaching.

00:08:04.319 --> 00:08:06.319
He says, called,

00:08:06.319 --> 00:08:09.319
do not forget the doing of good

00:08:09.319 --> 00:08:13.319
and to share what you have in a material way with others.

00:08:13.319 --> 00:08:18.319
For God is well pleased with such sacrifices.

00:08:18.319 --> 00:08:20.319
Tabitha, also called Dorcas,

00:08:20.319 --> 00:08:23.319
is mentioned in the Bible in a positive way,

00:08:23.319 --> 00:08:26.319
not necessarily for her zeal for preaching,

00:08:26.319 --> 00:08:29.319
but for making garments for others,

00:08:29.319 --> 00:08:31.319
acts of neighborly love.

00:08:31.319 --> 00:08:33.320
Acts 936 says,

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:36.320
she abounded in good deeds

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:39.320
and gifts of mercy that she was making.

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:42.320
She shared material things with others.

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:46.320
Also today, many abound in good deeds,

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:48.320
other than preaching,

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:53.320
we want to commend them all for letting their light shine.

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:58.889
1 Timothy 5, 9 and 10 speaks of widows,

00:08:58.889 --> 00:09:01.889
having a reputation for fine works.

00:09:01.889 --> 00:09:04.889
If she practiced hospitality,

00:09:04.889 --> 00:09:06.889
if she assisted the afflicted,

00:09:06.889 --> 00:09:10.889
if she devoted herself to every good work,

00:09:11.889 --> 00:09:14.889
there is not just one type of good work,

00:09:14.889 --> 00:09:16.889
not just preaching.

00:09:16.889 --> 00:09:18.889
We have many widows and other sisters

00:09:18.889 --> 00:09:23.889
that have the reputation for fine works of different sorts.

00:09:23.889 --> 00:09:27.889
We want to commend them all.

00:09:27.889 --> 00:09:31.889
We can also show neighborly love to those in need

00:09:31.889 --> 00:09:34.889
in times of disaster.

00:09:34.889 --> 00:09:36.889
Again, the field ministry

00:09:36.889 --> 00:09:39.889
is not the only ministry for Christians.

00:09:39.889 --> 00:09:42.889
It is also relief ministry.

00:09:42.889 --> 00:09:44.889
Assisting others materially

00:09:44.889 --> 00:09:47.889
is a fine work and ministry.

00:09:47.889 --> 00:09:49.889
When Christians in Judea

00:09:49.889 --> 00:09:51.889
became impoverished,

00:09:51.889 --> 00:09:54.889
relief campaigns were organized.

00:09:54.889 --> 00:09:56.889
Of the Macedonian Christians

00:09:56.889 --> 00:09:58.889
in the first century,

00:09:58.889 --> 00:10:01.889
it is said in 2 Corinthians 8.4,

00:10:01.889 --> 00:10:03.889
they on their own initiative

00:10:03.889 --> 00:10:05.889
kept earnestly begging us

00:10:05.889 --> 00:10:08.889
for the privilege of kindly giving

00:10:08.889 --> 00:10:11.889
prayer in the relief ministry,

00:10:11.889 --> 00:10:13.889
Greek Diaconia,

00:10:13.889 --> 00:10:15.889
for the holy ones.

00:10:15.889 --> 00:10:18.889
Just as preaching glorifies Jehovah,

00:10:18.889 --> 00:10:21.889
Paul goes on to say that this relief ministry

00:10:21.889 --> 00:10:23.889
glorifies God.

00:10:23.889 --> 00:10:25.889
2 Corinthians 9.13 says

00:10:25.889 --> 00:10:28.889
through the proof that this relief ministry

00:10:28.889 --> 00:10:31.889
gives they glorify God.

00:10:31.889 --> 00:10:34.889
As we approach the great tribulation,

00:10:34.889 --> 00:10:37.889
we do well to practice sharing things with others,

00:10:37.889 --> 00:10:39.889
as this may help them to survive

00:10:39.889 --> 00:10:43.200
the great tribulation.

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:45.200
Another area of neighborly love

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:47.200
is participation in the construction

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:50.200
of kingdom halls, assembly halls,

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:52.200
remote translation offices

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:54.200
and branch offices.

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:56.200
The construction of these

00:10:56.200 --> 00:11:00.200
is a holy ministry or sacred service.

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:02.200
One pioneer said,

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:04.200
I have now been a regular pioneer

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:06.200
for more than 20 years.

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:09.200
I have kept myself busy in many avenues

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:11.200
of the ministry,

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:13.200
serving with the need is greater,

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:16.200
helping with kingdom hall construction,

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:20.200
and assisting with disaster relief work.

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:22.200
Just as preaching is holy service,

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:24.200
so is participation in construction

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:26.200
of kingdom halls.

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:29.200
The organized to do Jehovah's will,

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:31.200
book says, quote,

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:33.200
the construction of kingdom halls

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:38.200
and assembly halls is a form of sacred service.

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:39.200
And then it asks,

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:41.200
are you in a position to assist

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:44.200
in this aspect of sacred service?

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:48.470
Serving in battle homes

00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:51.470
is also an avenue of the ministry.

00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:53.470
Therefore, if one's share in preaching

00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:55.470
and teaching is somewhat limited

00:11:55.470 --> 00:11:57.470
because of serving full-time

00:11:57.470 --> 00:12:00.470
in other avenues of holy service

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:02.470
or ministry, one does not have to have

00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:04.470
the bad conscience.

00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:07.470
Through these other forms of the ministry,

00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:11.750
one is letting his light shine.

00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:13.750
We can also let our light shine

00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:17.750
by displaying neighborly love toward non-witnesses.

00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:19.750
In Jesus' illustration

00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:21.750
of the merciful Samaritan,

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:23.750
he was emphatic

00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:26.750
that even though one is living at a distance

00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:29.750
or is not a relative or an associate,

00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:31.750
the real neighbor is the one

00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:34.750
who will exercise the love and kindness

00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:38.750
to another that the Scriptures command.

00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:40.750
Jesus taught others not only to preach

00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:42.750
but also to do good to them

00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:44.750
in a practical way,

00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:47.750
motivated by love and compassion.

00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:51.750
In that famous parable of the neighborly Samaritan,

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:53.750
the Samaritan took care of a Jew

00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:55.750
that was robbed and injured.

00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:57.750
He treated his wounds,

00:12:57.750 --> 00:12:59.750
he took him to an inn

00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:03.750
and paid for his care for a couple of days.

00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:05.750
This parable touches many so

00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:07.750
that they think

00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:10.750
that this event actually happened.

00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:11.750
It did not.

00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:13.750
It was a parable,

00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:16.750
but a very effective one.

00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:18.750
A man quoted the Scripture to Jesus

00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:20.750
that one should love Jehovah

00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:21.750
with his whole heart

00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:24.750
but also one's neighbor.

00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:25.750
The man then asked Jesus,

00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:27.750
who is my neighbor?

00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:29.750
Greek, please see on.

00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:32.750
Jesus ended the parable by saying,

00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:35.750
go and do the same yourself.

00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:40.960
We also want to do good to neighbors in need,

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:42.960
whether they have a false religion

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:44.960
or no religion.

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:46.960
We want to be as compassionate

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:49.960
as the merciful Samaritan in the parable.

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:51.960
Do we not?

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:53.960
Neighborly love was illustrated

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:55.960
in the case of an elderly man

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:57.960
who wrote to a local paper

00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:00.960
about Mr. and Mrs. Nice Guy.

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:02.960
He explained that his neighbors

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:03.960
had been kind to him

00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:06.960
when his wife was dying.

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:08.960
Since she passed away,

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:11.960
they have been super, he wrote.

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:14.960
Since then, they have adopted me,

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:16.960
doing all kinds of chores

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:18.960
and helping to solve the problems

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:21.960
of a 74-year-old retiree.

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:24.960
What makes all this even more unusual

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:26.960
is that they are black?

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:28.960
I'm white.

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:30.960
They are Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:34.720
I'm a drop-out Catholic.

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:37.720
When a hurricane hit an island years ago,

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:39.720
a lady who had her house cleaned

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:41.720
by a witness team said,

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:43.720
you have been coming to my door

00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:45.720
for a long time,

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:47.720
and I thought of you as good neighbors,

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:49.720
but this expression of neighborly love

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:54.539
shows me what your organization is about.

00:14:54.539 --> 00:14:57.539
When a hurricane hit the southern United States,

00:14:57.539 --> 00:14:59.539
a tree fell on the rooftop

00:14:59.539 --> 00:15:01.539
of an elderly lady's home.

00:15:01.539 --> 00:15:03.539
She called the company

00:15:03.539 --> 00:15:05.539
to find out how much they would charge

00:15:05.539 --> 00:15:08.539
for taking the tree off and cutting it up.

00:15:08.539 --> 00:15:11.539
She was told $1,000.

00:15:11.539 --> 00:15:14.539
She did not have that money available.

00:15:14.539 --> 00:15:16.539
Later, brothers from another state

00:15:16.539 --> 00:15:18.539
came with their chainsaws

00:15:18.539 --> 00:15:22.539
to help our brothers living on the same street.

00:15:22.539 --> 00:15:24.539
They also took down the tree

00:15:24.539 --> 00:15:27.539
of the elderly lady's house for free.

00:15:27.539 --> 00:15:29.539
A newspaper then wrote,

00:15:29.539 --> 00:15:31.539
many don't like Jehovah's Witnesses

00:15:31.539 --> 00:15:34.539
when they go from house to house with the Bible,

00:15:34.539 --> 00:15:36.539
but when they go from house to house

00:15:36.539 --> 00:15:38.539
with a chainsaw, they do like it.

00:15:38.539 --> 00:15:42.750
Returning from a trip,

00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:44.750
a brother and his family

00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:46.750
in a Latin country,

00:15:46.750 --> 00:15:48.750
where a few miles away from home

00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:50.750
when they saw a terrible automobile

00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:52.750
accident on the highway.

00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:55.750
They stopped to offer assistance.

00:15:55.750 --> 00:15:58.750
One of the drivers involved, a doctor,

00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:00.750
asked them to take his pregnant wife

00:16:00.750 --> 00:16:01.750
and two small daughters

00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:04.750
to the nearest hospital for treatment

00:16:04.750 --> 00:16:07.750
since police wanted to question him.

00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:09.750
The brother did so,

00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:10.750
and then the brother returned

00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:12.750
to the scene of the accident

00:16:12.750 --> 00:16:15.750
to see what further aid he could render.

00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:16.750
He told the doctor

00:16:16.750 --> 00:16:18.750
that he did not need to worry

00:16:18.750 --> 00:16:20.750
about his wife and children

00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:22.750
for he would take care of them.

00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:25.750
With grateful tears in his eyes,

00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:26.750
he then turned his valuables

00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:29.750
over to the brother for safekeeping.

00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:32.000
The brother and his family

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
took the man's family home

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
with them and cared for them

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000
for several days.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000
The doctor promised to study the Bible

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
in his hometown,

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.000
and he said that if his wife

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
gave birth to a son,

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
he would be named after the brother.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.279
Two years later,

00:16:51.279 --> 00:16:53.279
the brother visited the family.

00:16:53.279 --> 00:16:55.279
They were studying the Bible,

00:16:55.279 --> 00:16:58.279
and their little boy was named after the brother.

00:16:58.279 --> 00:17:03.870
Loving one's neighbor is most important

00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:04.869
because it is listed

00:17:04.869 --> 00:17:06.869
as the second greatest

00:17:06.869 --> 00:17:08.869
commandment in the Bible

00:17:08.869 --> 00:17:11.869
after loving Jehovah.

00:17:11.869 --> 00:17:13.869
When we do good to others,

00:17:13.869 --> 00:17:15.869
the motive for doing so

00:17:15.869 --> 00:17:17.869
should not be just to have a better chance

00:17:17.869 --> 00:17:19.869
to preach to them thereafter.

00:17:19.869 --> 00:17:22.869
It should come naturally to Christians

00:17:22.869 --> 00:17:24.869
to do good to others.

00:17:24.869 --> 00:17:26.869
We want to do good,

00:17:26.869 --> 00:17:27.869
whether we can preach to them

00:17:27.869 --> 00:17:30.869
thereafter or not.

00:17:30.869 --> 00:17:33.869
We want to imitate our loving Heavenly Father

00:17:33.869 --> 00:17:35.869
in doing the right

00:17:35.869 --> 00:17:39.819
and the loving thing.

00:17:39.819 --> 00:17:41.819
How about this one?

00:17:41.819 --> 00:17:44.819
Showing neighborly love to opposers.

00:17:44.819 --> 00:17:47.819
Suppose you have an opposing neighbor.

00:17:47.819 --> 00:17:49.819
As you are driving down the road,

00:17:49.819 --> 00:17:51.819
you see that his car broke down,

00:17:51.819 --> 00:17:54.819
and there he is at the roadside.

00:17:54.819 --> 00:17:55.819
What are you going to do?

00:17:55.819 --> 00:17:58.819
Pass by, pretending not to have seen him,

00:17:58.819 --> 00:18:00.819
or will you help if you can

00:18:00.819 --> 00:18:02.819
as suggested by the principle

00:18:02.819 --> 00:18:06.819
in the parable of the merciful Samaritan?

00:18:06.819 --> 00:18:09.819
This is in line with Jesus' statement

00:18:09.819 --> 00:18:12.819
in Luke 633-35.

00:18:12.819 --> 00:18:14.819
And if you do good to those

00:18:14.819 --> 00:18:16.819
doing good to you,

00:18:16.819 --> 00:18:18.819
of what credit is this to you?

00:18:18.819 --> 00:18:21.819
Even the sinners do the same.

00:18:21.819 --> 00:18:22.819
Then he said,

00:18:22.819 --> 00:18:25.819
continue to love your enemies

00:18:25.819 --> 00:18:28.819
and to do good.

00:18:28.819 --> 00:18:32.819
Even our enemies are our neighbors.

00:18:32.819 --> 00:18:33.819
We may not love them

00:18:33.819 --> 00:18:35.819
in the sense of being fond of them,

00:18:35.819 --> 00:18:37.819
in Greek filia,

00:18:37.819 --> 00:18:40.819
but in the sense of principled love

00:18:40.819 --> 00:18:44.200
in Greek agapi.

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:46.200
Even if we have to suffer

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:49.200
or are being persecuted,

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:53.200
we continue to show neighborly love.

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:57.200
First Peter 4, 19 states,

00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:59.200
so then let those who are suffering

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:01.200
in harmony with the will of God

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:03.200
keep on entrusting themselves

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:05.200
to a faithful creator

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:09.769
while they are doing good.

00:19:09.769 --> 00:19:11.769
Jehovah also does good,

00:19:11.769 --> 00:19:13.769
not only to His servants,

00:19:13.769 --> 00:19:15.769
but to good ones and bad ones,

00:19:15.769 --> 00:19:19.769
giving them good things through nature.

00:19:19.769 --> 00:19:22.769
In review, how do we let our light shine?

00:19:22.769 --> 00:19:25.769
What fine works are we to produce?

00:19:25.769 --> 00:19:28.769
How can we show neighborly love?

00:19:28.769 --> 00:19:30.769
We do it by preaching,

00:19:30.769 --> 00:19:32.769
by doing good to our brothers

00:19:32.769 --> 00:19:34.769
in the congregation,

00:19:34.769 --> 00:19:37.769
by supporting relief campaigns,

00:19:37.769 --> 00:19:40.769
by doing good to non-witnesses,

00:19:40.769 --> 00:19:42.769
including opposers.

00:19:42.769 --> 00:19:44.769
We ran the sacred service also

00:19:44.769 --> 00:19:48.769
by supporting theocratic construction projects,

00:19:48.769 --> 00:19:50.769
and by serving at Bethel

00:19:50.769 --> 00:19:52.769
for assembly halls.

00:19:52.769 --> 00:19:57.769
All this is included in letting our light shine.

00:19:57.769 --> 00:19:59.769
In the case of electrical light,

00:19:59.769 --> 00:20:01.769
there could be blackouts

00:20:01.769 --> 00:20:04.769
when everything comes to a halt or standstill.

00:20:04.769 --> 00:20:07.769
In our case, there will never be a figurative blackout

00:20:07.769 --> 00:20:11.769
because a second Thessalonians 3.13 says,

00:20:11.769 --> 00:20:16.769
we will not give up in doing what is good.

00:20:16.769 --> 00:20:18.769
Our good works cannot be overlooked,

00:20:18.769 --> 00:20:20.769
just like a city on a mountain

00:20:20.769 --> 00:20:22.769
cannot be overlooked.

00:20:22.769 --> 00:20:24.769
They will not be overlooked

00:20:24.769 --> 00:20:27.769
because we will continue to let our light shine

00:20:27.769 --> 00:20:31.769
by multiple fine works, including preaching.

00:20:31.769 --> 00:20:34.769
Our light conquers the darkness of this world

00:20:34.769 --> 00:20:38.769
that is referred to in Isaiah 60 verse 2,

00:20:38.769 --> 00:20:41.769
and our good works glorify Jehovah.
