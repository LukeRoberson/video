WEBVTT

00:00:01.169 --> 00:00:10.169
In this symposium, we've been reminded that Jehovah cherishes and empowers those who serve him loyally.

00:00:10.169 --> 00:00:16.170
In this concluding part of this symposium, we'll focus on single brothers and sisters.

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.170
Let's answer three questions.

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:26.170
First, how do we know that married and single Christians all have an honored place in the congregation?

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:33.170
Second, how can we show that we value and support our fellow believers who are not married?

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:41.170
And third, if you're single, how can you be a successful fighter for the faith?

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:47.170
To begin, let's briefly consider Jehovah's view of married and single Christians.

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:52.170
One thing we love about our God is that Jehovah is not partial.

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:59.170
Regardless of a person's nationality or skin color, anyone who wishes can serve him acceptably.

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:09.170
Jehovah's impartiality also means that he does not favor married or single Christians one over the other.

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.170
Really remaining single or getting married is a personal choice.

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:21.170
And nowhere does the Bible state that our value to Jehovah is linked to being either single or married.

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:31.170
For example, at Matthew chapter 19 and verse 12, Jesus said that some of his followers would choose to remain single on account of the kingdom.

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:37.170
He then went on to say, let the one who can make room for it make room for it.

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.170
Now, think about that for a moment.

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:46.170
If a Christian, younger or older chooses to remain single for the sake of the kingdom,

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:54.170
Jehovah and Jesus respect such a decision and they appreciate the good motive behind that personal choice.

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:59.170
Other Christians are unmarried due to circumstances in life.

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:04.170
For example, some faithful Christians in the congregation are too young to marry.

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.169
Others have lost a maid due to death or divorce.

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:17.169
The Apostle Paul maintained God's impartial view of both single and married Christians.

00:02:17.169 --> 00:02:23.169
Like Jesus, Paul did not teach the Christians should marry or that they should remain single.

00:02:23.169 --> 00:02:30.169
In commenting on Paul's first inspired letter to the Corinthians, the watchtower back in 2012 said this.

00:02:30.169 --> 00:02:37.169
Really, both marriage and singleness can be described as gifts from God.

00:02:37.169 --> 00:02:42.169
Jehovah does not view singleness as a cause for shame or grief.

00:02:42.169 --> 00:02:46.169
Singleness may bring a Christian certain advantages.

00:02:46.169 --> 00:02:56.169
An unmarried Christian who is not weighed down with family responsibilities may have more time and energy to devote to God's service than a married Christian.

00:02:56.169 --> 00:03:03.169
Of course, single Christians do not view themselves as better than married Christians for this reason.

00:03:03.169 --> 00:03:07.169
The Bible's message, Jehovah's thinking is clear, isn't it?

00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:15.169
Married and single Christians all can have an honored place in the congregation.

00:03:15.169 --> 00:03:18.169
Now, let's consider our second question.

00:03:18.169 --> 00:03:26.169
How can we who are married show that we value and support fellow believers who are not married?

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:33.169
Please open your Bible with me to first Corinthians chapter 12 and notice verse 25.

00:03:33.169 --> 00:03:41.169
In the context, we notice that Paul is emphasizing that in the Christian congregation, we need one another.

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:43.169
We depend on one another.

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:53.169
Just as we need all the parts of our literal body, our eyes, our hands, and our feet, all Christians single and married are valued and needed.

00:03:53.169 --> 00:03:58.169
So how can we show that we appreciate our single brothers and sisters?

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:01.169
Let's read verse 25.

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:12.169
So that there should be no division in the body, and here's the point, but its members should have mutual concern for one another.

00:04:12.169 --> 00:04:23.170
The study edition of the New World Translation says that this expression have mutual concern for one another could also be rendered as be anxious over one another.

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:25.170
Well, the lesson is clear.

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:27.170
Married Christians.

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:37.170
We show appreciation for single brothers and sisters when we show concern for their welfare, whether that's spiritually or physically.

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:46.170
We do not ignore them. We don't look down on them, nor do we treat them as if we have very little in common with them.

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:51.170
In this regard, the Apostle Paul said an example worthy of imitation.

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:56.170
He was keenly interested in Timothy's spiritual health and progress.

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:03.170
Though single, Paul saw potential in Timothy and invested in that spiritual man.

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:06.170
And what happened as a result?

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:13.170
An inexperienced young single Christian became an excellent overseer.

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:21.170
And when the two of them, Paul and Timothy were no longer traveling together, Paul continued to show genuine interest in Timothy's welfare.

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:28.170
We know that because he wrote two letters that Jehovah has preserved for our benefit in the Holy Scriptures.

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:36.170
Now, can you imagine how Timothy must have felt to have received a letter from his older friend Paul?

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:45.170
For just a moment, let's put ourselves in Timothy's sandals as we listen to just a few lines from Paul's first letter.

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:57.170
To Timothy, a genuine child in the faith, may you have undeserved kindness and mercy and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:01.170
A little later in the letter, Timothy would have read this.

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:13.170
This instruction I entrust to you, my child Timothy, in harmony with the prophecies that were made about you, that by these you may go on waging the fine warfare.

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:16.170
Then there was this encouragement.

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:25.170
Do not neglect the gift in you that was given you through a prophecy when the body of elders laid their hands on you.

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:33.170
Do you think those words of encouragement reassured Timothy and made him feel appreciated without a doubt?

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:39.170
In the same letter, Paul went on to express concern about Timothy's frequent cases of sickness.

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:51.170
Paul's concerned for Timothy's welfare, his spiritual and physical welfare, no doubt touched Timothy's heart and encouraged him to move forward in Jehovah's service.

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:56.170
And Paul's example touches our heart as well.

00:06:56.170 --> 00:07:08.170
We may be moved to ask ourselves, is there more I can do to look out for the needs of single ones who are exerting themselves in God's service?

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:18.170
Do I wrongly view single ones as incomplete, inferior or lacking, or do I show them honor?

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:23.170
As a traveling overseer, Timothy was a success.

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:25.170
Paul did not look down on him.

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:36.170
Rather, Paul chose Timothy, a single Christian for weighty assignments and gave him the training he needed in order to succeed.

00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:48.170
Today, I'm sure you and I can think of many practical ways that we can demonstrate our concern for the welfare of our fellow believers who are unmarried.

00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:55.170
The August 2020 issue of the Watchtower provided this reminder in a study article, I read.

00:07:55.170 --> 00:08:02.170
We do well to keep in mind that those some single Christians have made it a personal goal to remain unmarried.

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:07.170
Other Christians would like to marry, but they simply have not found the right person.

00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:11.170
Still others may have lost their mate in death.

00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:22.170
In any case, should those in the congregation feel the need to ask single Christians why they are not married or to offer help to find a mate?

00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:29.170
When we reason on Jehovah's thinking as found in the Scriptures, we know the answer to that question.

00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:38.169
We do not need to ask single ones when they are getting married, nor do we need to pair them up with other single ones if they have not requested our help.

00:08:38.169 --> 00:08:49.169
Instead, we should look for ways to commend them for their fine example and assure them that we love and appreciate them.

00:08:49.169 --> 00:08:57.169
In the following dramatization, please note what an elder learned about the challenges faced by single ones.

00:08:59.059 --> 00:09:04.059
Brothers, it's hard to believe this is our last time together.

00:09:04.059 --> 00:09:09.059
Wow, we have the pack agenda, so let's get started.

00:09:09.059 --> 00:09:15.059
This is our last week with our circuit overseer before he leaves us for his new circuit assignment.

00:09:15.059 --> 00:09:22.059
Rick's been a great circuit overseer, spiritually mature, experienced, and patient with us.

00:09:22.059 --> 00:09:24.059
Tom, you thought?

00:09:25.059 --> 00:09:48.379
Rick is single, and sadly, there were plenty times we turned that gift into a challenge, ever since his first visit.

00:09:48.379 --> 00:09:49.379
Hello, Jeff.

00:09:49.379 --> 00:09:51.379
Yeah, I have a minute.

00:09:51.379 --> 00:09:53.379
Oh, that.

00:09:53.379 --> 00:09:57.379
Longer night. My washing machine is a clunker.

00:09:57.379 --> 00:10:01.379
I just assumed a single brother had lots of free time.

00:10:01.379 --> 00:10:05.379
I didn't know how much he had to do on his own.

00:10:06.379 --> 00:10:09.379
But there was a lot more I didn't understand.

00:10:13.379 --> 00:10:17.200
Hello, bye.

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:18.200
Hey.

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:20.200
Look.

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:22.200
They have something there.

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:24.200
It sounds like a great Bible study.

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:26.200
I can't wait to meet her.

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:27.200
Thank you very much. See you then.

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:29.200
See you.

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:31.200
Thank you.

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:36.440
I don't know what you're waiting for.

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:38.440
For what?

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:42.440
Come on. A single circuit overseer, a pioneer sister.

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:47.970
You've got to be looking for a CEO wife.

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:51.970
Well, the teasing was so inappropriate.

00:10:51.970 --> 00:10:58.009
And was there at every visit.

00:10:58.009 --> 00:11:07.470
Then there were those trying to be, how should I say, helpful?

00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:09.470
Look.

00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:12.470
You want to meet them.

00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:16.470
So I invite them for lunch Saturday.

00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:18.470
Rick never asked for that help.

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:24.470
All it did was put him and plenty of sisters in an awkward situation.

00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:27.470
That's what he dealt with week after week.

00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:32.720
We all failed the times to see past the single person

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:37.720
to the spiritual man giving Jehovah his best.

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:39.720
We'll miss you.

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:42.720
Just maybe not as much as some of the sisters.

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:46.720
I didn't want to make that mistake again

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:48.720
with any single brother or sister.

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:50.720
Rick, Jeff, thank you.

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:52.720
I learned a lot from you.

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:55.720
And I hope Jehovah blesses you wherever you go.

00:11:55.720 --> 00:12:01.779
Yes, thanks, Rayland.

00:12:01.779 --> 00:12:04.779
Let's now consider our final point.

00:12:04.779 --> 00:12:10.779
If you're single, you too can be powerful by faith.

00:12:10.779 --> 00:12:12.779
But how?

00:12:12.779 --> 00:12:18.779
A great help in building faith is by setting and reaching spiritual goals.

00:12:18.779 --> 00:12:22.779
Of Abraham, Romans chapter 4 and verse 20 says,

00:12:22.779 --> 00:12:27.779
because of the promise of God, he did not waver in a lack of faith.

00:12:27.779 --> 00:12:31.779
Like Abraham, we encourage you single brothers and sisters

00:12:31.779 --> 00:12:35.779
to frequently meditate on God's promises.

00:12:35.779 --> 00:12:40.779
Thinking often about how Jehovah has kept every promise to us in the past,

00:12:41.779 --> 00:12:46.779
how he's keeping his promises now, surely encourages us to remember

00:12:46.779 --> 00:12:51.779
that he will keep every promise that he has made for our future,

00:12:51.779 --> 00:12:55.779
doing so strengthens our faith.

00:12:55.779 --> 00:12:58.779
Like Jesus, like Paul, like Timothy,

00:12:58.779 --> 00:13:01.779
talk about Jehovah's promises with others

00:13:01.779 --> 00:13:05.779
by zealously sharing in the field ministry.

00:13:06.779 --> 00:13:10.779
Do not isolate yourself from others in the congregation

00:13:10.779 --> 00:13:13.779
thinking that you have very little to contribute.

00:13:13.779 --> 00:13:19.779
No, you have much to contribute as a faithful brother or sister

00:13:19.779 --> 00:13:21.779
in the Christian congregation.

00:13:21.779 --> 00:13:24.779
We warmly encourage you to reach out

00:13:24.779 --> 00:13:28.779
and associate with spiritually mature ones in your congregation

00:13:28.779 --> 00:13:30.779
whether single or married.

00:13:30.779 --> 00:13:34.779
Like Timothy, ponder over these things.

00:13:34.779 --> 00:13:37.779
Be absorbed in spiritual pursuits

00:13:37.779 --> 00:13:42.779
so that your advancement may be plainly manifest to all.

00:13:42.779 --> 00:13:48.779
Remember, you are needed and loved.

00:13:48.779 --> 00:13:51.779
Well, what have all of us learned in this faith strengthening

00:13:51.779 --> 00:13:54.779
and encouraging symposium?

00:13:54.779 --> 00:13:58.779
Please open your Bible with me to Hebrews chapter 11.

00:13:58.779 --> 00:14:02.779
Starting in verse 4, you'll notice as you scan the verses

00:14:02.779 --> 00:14:05.779
that many familiar names of men and women of faith

00:14:05.779 --> 00:14:07.779
are outlined for us.

00:14:07.779 --> 00:14:11.779
There's Abel and Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Sarah,

00:14:11.779 --> 00:14:16.779
Rahab, Gideon and David, and many more.

00:14:16.779 --> 00:14:20.779
All of these men and women had different circumstances in life.

00:14:20.779 --> 00:14:21.779
It's true.

00:14:21.779 --> 00:14:24.779
But what did they all have in common?

00:14:24.779 --> 00:14:28.779
Notice Hebrews chapter 11 and verse 34.

00:14:28.779 --> 00:14:30.779
In the middle of the verse, it tells us

00:14:30.779 --> 00:14:34.779
they were made powerful.

00:14:34.779 --> 00:14:39.779
Yes, they were made powerful by faith

00:14:39.779 --> 00:14:41.779
and the same is happening today

00:14:41.779 --> 00:14:46.779
in every congregation of Jehovah's people earth-wide.

00:14:46.779 --> 00:14:50.779
Young ones, older ones, men and women,

00:14:50.779 --> 00:14:53.779
regardless of our family circumstances,

00:14:53.779 --> 00:14:57.779
all of us are being made powerful by faith.

00:14:57.779 --> 00:15:00.779
So dear brothers and sisters,

00:15:00.779 --> 00:15:05.779
please be assured that we love you and appreciate you.

00:15:05.779 --> 00:15:08.779
And may Jehovah bless your efforts

00:15:08.779 --> 00:15:12.779
to be a successful fighter for the faith.
