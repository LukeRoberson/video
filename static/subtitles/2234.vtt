00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:09.380
My mother was baptized in the convention in New York City in 1958.

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:15.300
When my dad was a contractor, he was a carpenter.

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:20.300
He would bring home cut off pieces of wood and different things

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:25.300
and we didn't have a lot of money, so I made toys and different things

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.300
out of the little pieces of wood and always had an interest in that type of thing.

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:35.990
King comes, it's a bamboo, it's stripped pieces of material

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:39.990
and it has to be woven and out of the holes on a chair

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:43.990
and then you weave it in and out and under it has different pattern.

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:48.990
Like the ones are one way, the twos go this way, the threes go in a diagonal

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.990
and the fours go this way and then as you weave the other pattern

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:55.990
you have to go under a piece and over a piece so it takes feel.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.959
So misconceptions about the blind is that they're limited when it comes to mental capacity.

00:01:06.959 --> 00:01:13.959
Sometimes people make assumptions that they think we feel this way or they think that

00:01:13.959 --> 00:01:20.959
and so you see the handicap and sometimes that prevents individuals from really seeing who the person is.

00:01:20.959 --> 00:01:22.959
That's a one occasion.

00:01:22.959 --> 00:01:26.959
It's very difficult having someone read to you and then retain.

00:01:26.959 --> 00:01:30.959
It's a little bit different when you read with your fingers, you feel,

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:36.959
it goes through your mind and then you can think it to get more senses involved.

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:41.959
Just as a sighted person would read with their eyes,

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:45.959
listen with their ears, it kind of gives you a little more impetus

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:48.959
and that's the beauty of being able to read it yourself.

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:54.959
One of the most depressed things of course is being able to help individuals

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:57.959
with God's word, the Bible.

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:03.959
At the congregation right now I'm conducting the Watchtower study

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:08.960
and the reader actually calls on individuals for me.

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:15.960
The Bible on the outside of the cover, it has the name of the books that are in

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.960
and I reach my hand there to feel what it is and then I can pull it off of the shelf.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:26.960
So it's a total of 18 volumes and after using it I kind of know where it is on the shelf.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.819
I can get close to reach.

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:36.819
The provision is wonderful and it's something I cherish deeply without it.

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:39.819
I would feel lost.

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:46.819
Daily Bible reading helps me to nourish my heart so that I can be motivated myself

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:53.819
and then be encouraging to others to help them in their service or in their course of life.
