00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:09.349
What's a real friend?

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:12.349
Someone who brings out the best in you.

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:16.859
Someone who's always there for you.

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.859
Even when times are tough.

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.859
Proverbs 1824 says that they can even

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.859
stick closer than a brother.

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.859
And now that's a real friend.

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.859
Friends like that are hard to find.

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:33.859
And if you worry too much about being liked by everyone,

00:00:33.859 --> 00:00:38.329
you just may settle for less.

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:42.799
So what should you look for?

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:45.799
Well, don't judge a book by its cover.

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:48.799
Look for what's on the inside.

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:51.799
Look for a friend you can trust.

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:54.799
A friend who forgives.

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:57.799
Someone who doesn't hold your mistakes against you.

00:00:57.799 --> 00:01:04.799
When it comes to friends, one good friend is better than a hundred fake ones.

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:10.799
To find a real friend, you may have to look outside your comfort zone.

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.799
They may be where you least expect.

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:19.870
So be open-minded, branch out.

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.870
Don't just settle for a clone of yourself.

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:27.870
Potential friends could have hobbies or talents that you don't have.

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:31.870
They could be older or younger.

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:35.870
They could be of a different background or culture.

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:37.870
So don't limit yourself.

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:42.870
But remember, real friends need to have good standards.

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.870
Have you ever had a friend who took advantage of you?

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:48.870
Or talked behind your back?

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:51.870
Or spread lies about you?

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:53.870
You deserve better than that.

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.870
So watch out for toxic friends.

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.870
Toxic friends care only about what they can get out of you.

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.870
They tear you down because of the way you talk,

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.870
the way you look, or even for your beliefs.

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:11.430
Real friends aren't like that.

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.430
They let you be yourself.

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.430
So you need to choose smart friends.

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.939
Not just book smart, but smart in life.

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:25.939
They are the kind that stands for something, and they show it.

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:30.939
Proverbs 27-17 says that true friends learn from each other.

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:32.939
It just is iron sharp and dying.

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:35.939
They even make you a better person.

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:38.939
So how do you get a friend like that?

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:41.939
You can't always expect people to reach out to you.

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:43.939
You need to take the initiative.

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:46.939
Take the first step and start a conversation.

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:51.789
Wait. You do need to talk.

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:53.789
But not just about yourself.

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:55.789
Ask them questions.

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:57.789
Then listen.

00:02:57.789 --> 00:02:59.789
Really listen.

00:02:59.789 --> 00:03:04.789
You see, listening is one of the best gifts you can give a friend.

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:06.789
Now what?

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:09.789
Now it's time to put in some work.

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:12.789
That's right. Work.

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:15.789
You have to work to make this friendship grow.

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:18.789
So be the kind of friend that's loyal.

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:20.789
Who doesn't hold a grudge.

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:24.789
Be there for them, even when times get tough.

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:29.789
But when you do this, your friendship will really grow.

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:33.789
Philippians 2.4 says to keep an eye, not just on yourself,

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:36.789
but to take an interest in others.

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:42.789
Taking an interest in others is what friendship is all about.

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:46.789
You know, you're going to meet a lot of people in life.

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:49.789
It'll be up to you to choose your friends.

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:51.789
So choose wisely.

00:03:51.789 --> 00:03:54.789
Choose real friends.
