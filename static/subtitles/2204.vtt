WEBVTT

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:06.139
Previously on remember the wife of lot we wanted to invite you all of you

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.939
To the hall of the Sunday we have a special speaker. We'll have to talk about that

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.019
The safest road is to get a good job with a good company

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:19.219
Yeah, but should we be pushing Anna and Tina to succeed in this system?

00:00:20.219 --> 00:00:27.500
We are living at a time when it is vital that we do not look back in a fair sense

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:47.280
Brian, this dog is going so well. You're gonna join us. Thanks for thinking of me Henry, but I can't accept it

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.840
Why not? This is a good opportunity and you need more income. You seem confident, Henry, but I'm sorry. I just can't accept it

00:00:53.840 --> 00:01:01.600
You don't trust my investment strategy. That's it, isn't it? Just say so. Look you already know. I think your latest investments are risky

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:09.790
And no, I'm not gonna gamble my meager funds, but that's not it. Brian, the risk of money to make money

00:01:10.349 --> 00:01:13.549
Don't you understand that even if there weren't any risk involved

00:01:13.629 --> 00:01:18.030
I can't accept a job offer that's gonna take so much of my time and money Brian

00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:26.670
I don't get it. All you have to do is sacrifice a little time for copper beers and you'd have all the money you need

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:33.150
Henry, I hope it works out for you. Okay, but I can't accept all right. Just just say hi to Jennifer for me. Okay. All right. Bye

00:01:33.629 --> 00:01:46.109
Who's that? You're client? That was just your brother. He wants to give me involved in one of his investment businesses

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:52.989
But I don't have time or money for that. Well, I think we need to invest our money into something more secure like real estate

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.030
And we need to move across the town where we can network with more influential people

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:04.510
Is this your mom's idea because we can't afford this. We're already too much in debt. Well, look

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.469
We can mortgage this place and then rent it out. We're not taking full advantage of this opportunity

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:12.110
We need to put the kingdom first. I am putting kingdom first

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:16.990
But this is the time to think about our future. How many working years do we have left anyway

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.150
But if you don't plan ahead we'll end up living on the street

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:28.110
Why are you all dressed up like this? Are you going on service?

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.870
I'm going to real estate classes. What? We didn't talk about this. Why?

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.750
If you made her my money out in half too

00:02:37.389 --> 00:02:47.650
We've never gone without go away. Do you have cash? I need you for taxi

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.280
Hey boys, I just heard your dad pull up

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:54.479
Start getting ready for dinner. Hey babe. How's it going? All right. How you doing? Good

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:59.280
What a day. Hey dinner's gonna be ready soon. So go wash up. Okay. Oh, all right. Yeah

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:11.580
Hey guys you want to wrap this game up? Just get ready for dinner. What did I just say?

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.060
Put this furniture back and get ready for dinner

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:20.509
Something important we got to talk about tonight

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:26.990
So what did you want to talk about that was so important?

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.930
All right. Okay. I've decided something

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:38.689
I decided that I want uh

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:40.930
Well, I want us all

00:04:41.569 --> 00:04:47.490
To start studying the Bible together. What? You mean you want to become a priest? Come on Rick

00:04:48.209 --> 00:04:51.970
It's Jehovah's Witnesses, isn't it, Dad? I borrowed your book

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:58.129
I liked it. Well, I think it's a good idea. You know, I really like those people

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:04.129
And it seems to be helping you Joe. You seem so much happier. Yeah. No. Yeah. Yeah, I am

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:07.730
So like I said, that's what I decided

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:11.329
But I really want us all to be in on this together

00:05:12.209 --> 00:05:14.209
all right, so

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:16.610
What do you say boys? Sure, Dad

00:05:21.970 --> 00:06:17.790
Right. Come on, Rick

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:18.990
Is that you?

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:20.670
Yeah, it is me

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:27.410
Gloria

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:28.930
What is all of this?

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:34.689
Ah, it's some new things that I pick up today. I made my first sale today, aren't you happy?

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:40.850
Yeah, yeah, that's that's great. We need the extra income, but it looks like you spent it already

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:46.129
Yeah, there's just a few things on good told me that I have to look professional to work for him

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:52.050
If I'm going to move up and attract the right type of off-skill client, I have to look the part, you know

00:06:52.769 --> 00:06:57.569
But Gloria, I thought you were doing this just to get a little extra income for our necessities

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:02.290
How much time are you planning to spend on this as much as it takes

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:08.209
You can't be successful by working less. We already have a very full schedule with our spiritual routine

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:14.050
We have to make sacrifices for what's most important in life. You know that this new job. I'm worried

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:19.170
It may mean sacrificing time. We should be spending on spiritual things. What about your pioneering?

00:07:20.129 --> 00:07:22.370
What about it? I can do both

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:45.970
Here you go, Joe, for a store

00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:55.139
Good morning, sir. How are you?

00:07:55.139 --> 00:08:01.060
Oh, you people again? Look, don't you have real jobs? I have a real job and you keep waking me up, okay?

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:04.180
I'm sorry Frank, forgive us. We didn't mean to upset you man. Joe?

00:08:04.579 --> 00:08:08.339
Yeah, it's me, Joe. I didn't even recognize you man. How are you doing, Joe man?

00:08:08.339 --> 00:08:11.379
How you doing? Sorry. I'm good. It's been a while.

00:08:11.379 --> 00:08:14.100
It has. We used to work together back in the day.

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:17.779
It's the last time we saw each other. I think it was that time we were hauling that lumber.

00:08:17.779 --> 00:08:24.579
Oh, and we were loading it and then it all fell over in the street and it took us forever to clean it up and it was terrible.

00:08:24.579 --> 00:08:30.259
What you should have saw was how mad this guy was so mad man. You almost see the fumes coming out of his ears.

00:08:30.259 --> 00:08:34.980
Yeah, that was the old Joe Frank. Looks like I got a new Joe here though. You all dressed up.

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:39.700
Yeah, everything will bring you back. Well, actually we have some good news. We'd like to share with you.

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:44.820
Good news, huh? Okay, I like good news. Well, why don't you come on in and I get some beers and we can talk about this good news.

00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:48.340
But no thanks on the beers this morning. Oh, okay. Welcome on in here.

00:08:48.340 --> 00:09:01.809
Okay. This place is so big and fancy. I couldn't make so much money if I closed this deal today.

00:09:01.809 --> 00:09:16.049
Uncle, so proud. It's so proud now. I'll tell all my relatives what a big, important real time I got.

00:09:16.049 --> 00:09:21.889
Did she accept the internship with your cousin's business? You know how hard I work to set it up.

00:09:21.889 --> 00:09:25.809
I know mom. Thank you so much for everything. She starts next week.

00:09:25.809 --> 00:09:32.929
You make me so happy. There's something else. If I make the sale today, I'll have enough to make down payment

00:09:32.929 --> 00:09:36.690
on the bigger apartment that I told you about the one on the east side.

00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:40.370
The fancy one your uncle's from owns? Yes, that one.

00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:45.490
Mmm. I'm so excited. I know me too. I can't wait to tell everybody.

00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:49.409
Mom, I think my clients are here. I gotta go. Talk to you later, okay?

00:09:49.409 --> 00:11:26.269
Okay, okay. Congratulations. Thanks brother Williams. Thanks so much.

00:11:27.070 --> 00:11:31.710
Really proud of them all. Yeah, so am I. Well, how have you been? You know, we've been good.

00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:37.309
Just like Jesus said, we always have enough to pay the bills and sometimes even a little extra.

00:11:37.309 --> 00:11:39.710
What do you think? That's right. Congratulations.

00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:41.870
Oh, thank you. Thank you so much. I'm so happy for you.

00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:43.950
Yeah, but hey, I know it's just the beginning.

00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:46.269
Really? So what's next?

00:11:46.269 --> 00:11:48.750
Actually, I want to learn sign language. Wow.

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:50.990
Maybe join the congregation. Hopefully pretty soon.

00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:53.309
That sounds exciting. Good for you.

00:11:53.309 --> 00:11:55.710
I've been teaching myself so far. Yeah.

00:11:55.710 --> 00:12:00.750
As far as I've gotten is I'm learning sign language, and that's all I know.

00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:03.470
That's very impressive. You gotta start somewhere.

00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:10.159
Yeah, that's true. Tina, I was just congratulating Wiki.

00:12:10.159 --> 00:12:10.960
Hi, Tina.

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:13.919
Hi, Gloria. Hi, brother Williams.

00:12:13.919 --> 00:12:14.559
Hi, Gloria.

00:12:14.559 --> 00:12:17.600
Good. I love to talk to you, but I have an appointment. I gotta go.

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:19.120
Oh. Talk to you later, okay?

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:21.950
Oh, okay.

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:24.990
Brian, where's Gloria going? Is she okay?

00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:28.350
Oh, yeah, brother Williams. She had to leave.

00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:31.309
Gloria's going to catch the rest of the assembly next week.

00:12:32.669 --> 00:12:35.710
It's just been so busy with her real estate job lately.

00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:37.309
We needed extra money.

00:12:37.309 --> 00:12:39.870
You know, we moved into a better place over on the east side of town and

00:12:41.309 --> 00:12:42.909
well, I'm working a little bit more too.

00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:45.230
I'm just trying to make her happy.

00:12:48.929 --> 00:12:50.049
True happiness, Brian.

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:53.730
Joy, it's spiritual.

00:12:54.769 --> 00:12:57.730
You can't satisfy spiritual needs.

00:12:57.730 --> 00:12:59.090
With material things.

00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:04.769
I know, brother Williams, but this extra stress, it's just temporary.

00:13:05.649 --> 00:13:06.769
I've thought it all through.

00:13:07.649 --> 00:13:11.889
We've prayed about it and we've asked for Jehovah to bless this decision.

00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:18.049
Now, you know, Brian, Jehovah God cannot bless a decision

00:13:18.610 --> 00:13:20.529
if it is not in harmony with as well.

00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:23.649
Look at yourself. You don't seem happy.

00:13:24.129 --> 00:13:27.649
Well, what can I do now?

00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:33.649
Do all you can to protect your family spiritually and to save your girls?

00:13:38.289 --> 00:13:40.129
I appreciate the encouragement, brother Williams.

00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:47.409
You know, it seems like it's been a while since we've been able to talk like this.

00:13:47.409 --> 00:13:48.129
Oh, it has been.

00:13:50.049 --> 00:13:54.529
If you're not busy, would you be able to come over and join us for dinner tomorrow night?

00:13:55.169 --> 00:13:57.009
You know, I would love to do that.

00:13:57.009 --> 00:13:59.889
Why don't you text me your new address and the time

00:14:00.690 --> 00:14:02.370
and I'll look forward to seeing you tomorrow.

00:14:02.769 --> 00:14:03.570
That sounds good.

00:14:03.570 --> 00:14:04.450
That sounds great.

00:14:04.450 --> 00:14:05.009
Excellent.

00:14:05.649 --> 00:14:07.090
I look forward to seeing you tomorrow.

00:14:07.649 --> 00:14:21.409
Can I help with anything?

00:14:21.889 --> 00:14:22.529
Oh, yeah.

00:14:22.529 --> 00:14:23.889
Can you put the lemon in the water?

00:14:23.889 --> 00:14:24.289
Okay.

00:14:24.929 --> 00:14:27.649
Hey, guys, brother Williams is going to be here any minute, okay?

00:14:27.649 --> 00:14:34.480
And Anna and her friend from the North Courageant's supposed to come too, right?

00:14:35.039 --> 00:14:36.000
Yep, let's plan.

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:42.110
Thank you, Tina.

00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:48.559
Hi, Tina.

00:14:48.559 --> 00:14:49.360
Come on in.

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:50.000
How are you?

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:50.559
Good.

00:14:50.559 --> 00:14:51.759
It's good to see you.

00:14:51.759 --> 00:14:53.360
Brother Williams, you're rated.

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:54.480
Thanks for coming over us.

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:56.000
Thanks for the invitation.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:56.879
Very nice.

00:14:57.279 --> 00:14:57.679
Welcome.

00:14:58.720 --> 00:14:59.600
Hi, Gloria.

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:00.480
Hi, brother Williams.

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:03.200
I think I get lost in this big apartment.

00:15:03.759 --> 00:15:04.000
Well,

00:15:04.799 --> 00:15:06.559
Jovo blessed us for our hard work.

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:11.679
Really, it just means longer hours on the job and more work around the house.

00:15:13.279 --> 00:15:16.799
You know the other day in Phil's service, we passed by your old house.

00:15:16.799 --> 00:15:18.159
I like that place.

00:15:18.159 --> 00:15:19.759
I remember our nice visits there.

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:21.440
I knew too.

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:22.399
That was a great place.

00:15:22.879 --> 00:15:25.840
Well, Tina, do you want to show brother Williams around while he finished the coffee?

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:27.360
Okay, come on in.

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:32.860
Brother Williams likes the old place.

00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:35.019
Seems like he likes here too.

00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:43.779
That all seems very nice.

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:45.779
What do you think of this place, Tina?

00:15:47.539 --> 00:15:53.220
Well, honestly, I wish we never left the other place.

00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:53.539
Really?

00:15:54.419 --> 00:15:55.299
Why do you feel that way?

00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:59.840
Everything's so different here.

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:02.720
Everything has to look good for you to fit in.

00:16:03.279 --> 00:16:05.120
You have to wear the nicest clothes.

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:07.840
You have to drive the most expensive car.

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:12.960
Everything's, it's just, it's just different, that's all.

00:16:13.519 --> 00:16:15.279
Yeah, you know, I understand.

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:18.559
I was about your age when we moved into a new neighborhood.

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:20.720
And it can certainly be challenging.

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:22.399
But you know what, my help.

00:16:23.679 --> 00:16:24.639
And you said a new goal.

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:26.159
Okay, like what?

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:28.159
Well, what do you think?

00:16:28.159 --> 00:16:29.120
What interests you?

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:34.720
Well, I was thinking of learning a new language.

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:35.519
Really?

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:37.600
That's an excellent goal.

00:16:38.639 --> 00:16:40.639
What do you think of Ricky learning the same language?

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:42.960
Oh, I think it's really exciting.

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:43.679
I do too.

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:46.720
You know, he is really making the truth his own.

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:48.720
And he keeps on applying himself.

00:16:49.039 --> 00:16:51.279
Jehovah God has gone to really bless him.

00:16:51.279 --> 00:16:51.759
Yeah.

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:53.759
I was hoping to see Anna.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:54.720
Is Anna here?

00:16:55.279 --> 00:16:57.519
Oh, she's with Kevin.

00:16:57.919 --> 00:16:58.320
Kevin?

00:16:58.960 --> 00:16:59.759
Kevin, who?

00:16:59.759 --> 00:17:01.200
Kevin's one of our relatives.

00:17:01.759 --> 00:17:03.679
They worked together at a pharmaceutical company.

00:17:03.759 --> 00:17:06.079
He's a pretty nice guy and from nice family, too.

00:17:07.839 --> 00:17:09.200
Tina, are you okay?

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:12.480
How do you think Anna's doing?

00:17:18.099 --> 00:17:21.220
She's, she's going through different things right now.

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:25.059
We invited her friend over from the other congregation

00:17:25.059 --> 00:17:26.339
to maybe encourage her.

00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:27.460
That's nice.

00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:31.859
But you know, I have to commend you

00:17:31.859 --> 00:17:35.299
because you're doing so well spiritually,

00:17:35.299 --> 00:17:37.460
keeping up with your spiritual routine.

00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:40.180
And you think about learning a new language so you can help out.

00:17:40.819 --> 00:17:41.700
Keep up to go work.

00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:42.259
Don't give up.

00:17:43.619 --> 00:17:47.299
But Tina, we're not going to give up when you're sister.

00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:51.700
She has a potential of being a fine servant of Jehovah.

00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:54.019
And she has a good heart.

00:17:54.579 --> 00:17:57.299
I'm confident that in time, she's going to make the right decision.

00:17:58.259 --> 00:17:59.779
For the Williams, here's your coffee.

00:17:59.779 --> 00:18:00.180
Thank you.

00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:02.500
Sorry for the Williams.

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:03.539
I have to finish getting ready.

00:18:04.019 --> 00:18:08.289
Well, this looks really good, Anna.

00:18:08.289 --> 00:18:08.769
Good job.

00:18:09.250 --> 00:18:09.569
Really?

00:18:10.210 --> 00:18:10.450
Thanks.

00:18:11.890 --> 00:18:13.650
Hey, we're still behind schedule, though.

00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:16.690
So, I'm going to have to ask you to work overtime with the rest of the team.

00:18:16.690 --> 00:18:18.130
Just till we get caught up, okay?

00:18:18.849 --> 00:18:19.890
But I can't tonight.

00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:20.849
I have a family dinner.

00:18:20.849 --> 00:18:21.970
I have to go to.

00:18:21.970 --> 00:18:22.930
Dinner, Anna.

00:18:23.650 --> 00:18:25.970
If you want to be successful, work needs to come first.

00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:27.730
I have a one else that's doing it.

00:18:31.579 --> 00:18:33.819
I'll text my mom until I can't make it.

00:18:33.819 --> 00:18:34.460
Good.

00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:34.940
Don't worry.

00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:35.819
She'll understand.

00:18:35.819 --> 00:18:36.619
It's not my mom.

00:18:36.619 --> 00:18:37.259
I'm worried about.

00:18:37.259 --> 00:18:38.059
It's my dad.

00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:40.619
He doesn't want me working late anymore.

00:18:41.259 --> 00:18:41.660
Fine.

00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:43.579
I'll cover for you.

00:18:43.579 --> 00:18:44.779
We're all working late anyways.

00:18:44.779 --> 00:18:48.619
So, I'll give everyone right home and afterwards we'll step in for a few minutes.

00:18:48.619 --> 00:18:50.299
And I'll explain that's all my fault.

00:18:50.859 --> 00:18:51.099
Okay?

00:18:53.579 --> 00:18:56.779
So, does this mean we're going to meet those uptight parents of yours?

00:18:56.779 --> 00:18:57.980
They're not that uptight.

00:18:57.980 --> 00:18:58.779
I'm kidding.

00:18:58.779 --> 00:18:59.740
Lighting up.

00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:01.900
Hey, Anna's family is pre-conservative.

00:19:02.539 --> 00:19:04.299
So just be careful what you do say.

00:19:05.259 --> 00:19:06.779
This should be interesting.

00:19:06.779 --> 00:19:08.619
Tess, just be nice, okay?

00:19:08.619 --> 00:19:13.180
I had a really good time tonight.

00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:15.259
I'm glad brother Williams can make it.

00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:17.259
Yeah, it was pretty nice.

00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:19.420
Yeah, I think he had a good time too.

00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:19.660
Yeah.

00:19:23.819 --> 00:19:24.059
Hi.

00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:28.140
It's a customer taking our shoes off, so.

00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:28.859
Oh, okay.

00:19:28.859 --> 00:19:30.059
Hey, Kevin's here, Tessa.

00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:31.819
Come with me guys.

00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:36.940
I know Kevin, but who are your friends, Anna?

00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:40.059
Oh yeah, Mom, Dad, this is Tess and Eric.

00:19:40.059 --> 00:19:41.420
We're in the same interim program.

00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:42.299
Nice to meet you all.

00:19:42.299 --> 00:19:43.180
Come on in and have a seat.

00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:45.900
Anna, come here.

00:19:46.779 --> 00:19:51.740
Um, would you like some?

00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:54.380
Anna, you missed dinner with brother Williams tonight.

00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:55.900
And your friend from the North Car Engageant,

00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:57.660
she came to what happened.

00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:01.019
That, I know, but we had to work late.

00:20:01.019 --> 00:20:02.380
I sent Mom a text.

00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:05.900
Anna, I was trying to do something spiritually encouraging for the family.

00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:09.099
We're worried about you, honey.

00:20:09.099 --> 00:20:11.980
Okay, Dad, I'm sorry, but it's no big deal.

00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:14.460
It's just that the new medication we're working on,

00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:15.660
it goes to market soon.

00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:17.579
It's really important.

00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:18.940
It could save people's lives.

00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:20.619
No big deal.

00:20:20.619 --> 00:20:25.099
Anna, first of all, you know only God's kingdom will solve our problems.

00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:27.339
These kids in your work,

00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:30.619
it's getting in the way of what's most important.

00:20:30.619 --> 00:20:34.539
That these kids are on my team and they understand what I'm working on.

00:20:34.539 --> 00:20:36.859
The brothers don't, way over their heads.

00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:41.099
Anna, don't you see they're changing now?

00:20:41.099 --> 00:20:42.059
Would you relax?

00:20:42.059 --> 00:20:43.500
Just go talk to them, okay?

00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:54.589
You know, I really wanted to apologize to both of you.

00:20:55.230 --> 00:20:57.150
It's my fault that Anna's late today.

00:20:57.150 --> 00:21:00.509
I asked the entire team to work overtime so we could get caught up on schedule.

00:21:00.509 --> 00:21:02.990
But just let you know, she's doing really good.

00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:05.069
And we really do enjoy having on the team.

00:21:05.069 --> 00:21:06.349
Okay, thank you.

00:21:06.349 --> 00:21:07.470
You know, not just that.

00:21:07.470 --> 00:21:09.069
She's working with some good people.

00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:14.109
Tess and Eric, there's some of the best up-and-coming talents we have in the field.

00:21:14.109 --> 00:21:16.509
Your parents must be really proud of you,

00:21:16.509 --> 00:21:18.750
but my mom's are both really proud of me.

00:21:18.829 --> 00:21:20.910
I was raised by two wonderful women,

00:21:20.910 --> 00:21:23.069
you know, life partners.

00:21:23.069 --> 00:21:29.150
Oh, yeah, um, you know, my assistant Marty,

00:21:29.150 --> 00:21:31.470
I recently found out that he's gay.

00:21:31.470 --> 00:21:33.630
You say that like there's something wrong with it.

00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:34.829
Do you have a problem?

00:21:34.829 --> 00:21:36.190
Tess, don't do this.

00:21:36.190 --> 00:21:36.670
Why?

00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:38.589
There's nothing wrong with being gay.

00:21:38.589 --> 00:21:42.750
Tess, we live by the Bible's moral standards,

00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:45.789
but we don't force our beliefs on other people

00:21:45.789 --> 00:21:47.150
and we don't judge anyone either.

00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:49.309
But you do think being gay is wrong.

00:21:49.309 --> 00:21:51.230
Eric, remember where we're at?

00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:55.390
Well, we believe there are standards of right and wrong

00:21:55.390 --> 00:21:56.269
that we should live by.

00:21:56.990 --> 00:22:00.430
And God's word says that sex is meant to be between a man and a woman

00:22:00.430 --> 00:22:01.549
who are married to each other.

00:22:01.549 --> 00:22:03.869
Hey, look, I don't mean to be rude, sir,

00:22:03.869 --> 00:22:05.309
but the world has changed.

00:22:05.309 --> 00:22:08.349
Annie, maybe we're being too harsh on gays.

00:22:08.349 --> 00:22:10.190
Some people just seem to be programmed up.

00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:13.789
Look, I know not everyone agrees with us,

00:22:13.789 --> 00:22:15.150
but we all have free will.

00:22:15.789 --> 00:22:18.269
And God lets us choose to live by his standards or not.

00:22:18.829 --> 00:22:20.670
If we go against his standards,

00:22:20.670 --> 00:22:21.869
we end up hurting ourselves.

00:22:22.589 --> 00:22:24.190
He just wants what's best for us.

00:22:26.269 --> 00:22:27.630
Anna, what about you?

00:22:28.349 --> 00:22:29.309
Do you agree with your father?

00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:39.380
Well, you know, we actually have another project to do tomorrow.

00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:40.980
It's probably best that we get going.

00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:44.420
Wait, at least let me walk you guys outside.

00:22:59.710 --> 00:23:01.470
So this is our Anna's association?

00:23:02.109 --> 00:23:03.789
Hey, they're just kids.

00:23:04.509 --> 00:23:06.190
Kids talk like they know everything.

00:23:07.789 --> 00:23:09.230
Our Anna believes them.

00:23:17.359 --> 00:23:20.000
Okay, so I think you have all the invoices, right?

00:23:20.799 --> 00:23:22.880
I gave you all the receipts, right?

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:25.119
Yep, just got a couple more steps.

00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:34.500
Okay, Joe, your books are clean.

00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:37.859
I have no more concerns and amazingly, you're out of debt.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:44.799
Amazingly.

00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:47.359
I don't think so, man.

00:23:47.359 --> 00:23:49.839
It's like you've always said, if you do things,

00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:53.039
Jehovah's Way, right?

00:23:53.039 --> 00:23:54.400
He'll help us.

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:56.880
Hey, I got to go.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.119
You've got everything that you need.

00:23:59.119 --> 00:24:00.000
I think it looks good.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.599
So I'm just going to leave, okay?

00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:03.279
Oh, all right.

00:24:03.279 --> 00:24:04.480
Okay, hey, Brian.

00:24:07.119 --> 00:24:08.640
Can you stick around for another minute?

00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:10.079
There's something I need to talk to you about.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:12.640
Yeah, sure.

00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:13.519
Yeah, thanks.

00:24:23.019 --> 00:24:25.420
Look, Brian, I owe you a huge debt of gratitude, man.

00:24:26.299 --> 00:24:28.539
I was thinking back on when we first started studying.

00:24:28.539 --> 00:24:29.500
You remember that?

00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:33.980
I had all sorts of issues with my life, my family, my business, and

00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:36.940
my whole life was messed up.

00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:39.500
And one of the things that you always talked to me about

00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:42.299
was Matthew 624.

00:24:42.299 --> 00:24:43.180
You remember that?

00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:45.339
No one can serve two masters.

00:24:45.339 --> 00:24:47.579
You cannot slay for God and for riches.

00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:49.740
I'm sorry, Joe.

00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:50.940
I'm not getting it.

00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:51.900
What are you trying to say?

00:24:53.339 --> 00:24:56.380
Well, I guess what I'm trying to say is, I'm concerned about you.

00:24:57.339 --> 00:24:58.940
About me?

00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:03.339
Yes, yes, about you and your family.

00:25:03.339 --> 00:25:06.619
And I'm not talking about financially, right?

00:25:06.619 --> 00:25:08.220
I'm talking about spiritually.

00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:12.460
I mean, you're the one who always taught me never to cave into other people's

00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:13.579
expectations of me.

00:25:13.579 --> 00:25:16.700
And now it seems like you're the one who's doing that.

00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:18.859
What, man, what are you talking about, Joe?

00:25:18.859 --> 00:25:22.779
Brian, your whole life is changing, man.

00:25:22.779 --> 00:25:24.380
And not for the better.

00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:26.220
Look, it's written all over your face.

00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:31.660
Listen, you have no idea how much pressure Gloria is putting on me.

00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:35.980
You don't know what it's like to try to balance two lives, two worlds,

00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:37.660
and try to make it work.

00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:39.900
Oh, man, you're right.

00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:40.380
You're right.

00:25:40.380 --> 00:25:41.500
I don't know what that's like.

00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:44.460
So don't tell me about not changing for the better.

00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:48.299
Brian, all I know is what you taught me.

00:25:48.299 --> 00:25:50.940
And what you taught me was good, man.

00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:55.900
You made me look at myself, my family, my whole situation.

00:25:56.380 --> 00:25:59.259
And I had to ask myself, do I really know God?

00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:01.099
Am I truly happy?

00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:06.299
I mean, what you taught me, Brian, it gave me something new, the new world.

00:26:06.299 --> 00:26:07.339
It opened that up to me.

00:26:07.339 --> 00:26:09.500
It gave me and marrying the kids.

00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:11.500
It gave us all something to live for, Brian.

00:26:13.339 --> 00:26:18.619
But now when I look at you, my teacher, my brother, my friend,

00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:21.339
all I see is an unhappy man.

00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:27.920
So I thought it'd be a kind thing to help you, the way you help me.

00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:30.480
Brian, I made those changes in my life.

00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:32.319
The repairs that you helped me to make.

00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:38.480
So I just thought you could use a little reminder yourself.

00:26:39.839 --> 00:26:44.559
Because frankly, you're not the same person that I once knew.

00:26:47.099 --> 00:26:48.059
Man, I gotta go.

00:26:56.940 --> 00:26:57.819
Thanks for listening.

00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:07.779
Next time on, remember the wife of life.

00:27:07.779 --> 00:27:10.099
The way you live reflects on me.

00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:12.900
You must learn to keep your religion in its place.

00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:16.660
You could resolve this very easily.

00:27:17.539 --> 00:27:18.420
Do you understand?

00:27:19.539 --> 00:27:21.859
Think of all we taught the girls when they were little.

00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:25.940
About putting Jehovah ahead of everything else.

00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:27.140
This is your copy here.

00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:28.180
Okay, thank you.

00:27:28.180 --> 00:27:28.500
Okay.

00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:32.099
Director Williams, this is a nice surprise.

00:27:32.099 --> 00:27:34.420
I haven't seen you since you were overseeing our division.

00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:35.940
But I mean, what brings you here?

00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:37.380
Maybe have a moment.

00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:38.579
I'd love to tell you about it.
