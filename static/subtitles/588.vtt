00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:09.250
The theme for this discussion is Jehovah's Hand is awe-inspiring.

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:13.330
The human hand is an amazing creation.

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:19.929
It enables us to apply the power of our arm in very dexterous and versatile ways.

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:22.609
We can swing a sledgehammer.

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:25.129
We can thread a tiny sewing needle.

00:00:25.129 --> 00:00:31.010
The human hand is far superior to any animal's hand.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:39.810
In advantage, only humans have an opposing thumb that can easily touch our four other fingers.

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:45.770
To illustrate the human hand superiority, imagine an ape whose hand you see here trying

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:54.130
to take a pin and precisely sign his name, or trying to throw a curveball with a baseball.

00:00:54.130 --> 00:01:01.609
But as amazing as the human hand is, Jehovah's Hand is far more amazing.

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:04.930
In fact, it is awe-inspiring.

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:06.930
But what is Jehovah's Hand?

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.849
Well, here's one definition.

00:01:08.849 --> 00:01:17.010
Jehovah's Hand is his ability to apply the great power of his Holy Spirit in various ways.

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:23.689
In fact, let's discuss four examples of Jehovah using his awe-inspiring hand to apply

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:27.290
the great power of his Holy Spirit.

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:33.569
And then, after we discuss each one, we'll comment just briefly on how we can work in harmony

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:36.170
with this specific use of Jehovah's Hand.

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.010
Now, let's go to Proverbs 21.

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:42.969
Today's scripture text, let's read it again.

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:50.890
Proverbs 21-1, a king's heart is like streams of water in Jehovah's Hand.

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.409
He directs it wherever he pleases.

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:57.010
Now, what is this telling as well?

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:03.049
In order to accomplish his will, Jehovah can maneuver the heart of any government official

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:05.450
to do something or not do something.

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.250
Now, here's one Bible example.

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:14.210
Persian King Artisert Z's granted all of Ezra's requests.

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.729
Amazingly, he did this.

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:19.889
About going to Jerusalem and advancing pure worship.

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.569
Well, what motivated the king's heart to do this?

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:25.849
Ezra knew whether credit belonged.

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:28.490
At Ezra 727, he said,

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:31.250
May Jehovah be praised,

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.569
who put it into the heart of the king

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:37.289
to beautify the house of Jehovah in Jerusalem.

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:41.169
Now, that's just one Bible example of many that could be discussed.

00:02:41.169 --> 00:02:47.169
But now, our question, how can we work in harmony with this use of Jehovah's Hand?

00:02:47.169 --> 00:02:52.569
Well, for one thing, we can pray, if it be Jehovah's will,

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:58.770
that he maneuver the hearts of government officials to make decisions

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.610
that will benefit Jehovah's people.

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.810
We can also pray for Jehovah to move the hearts of officials

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.810
to treat our imprisoned brothers kindly.

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.650
And that's in harmony with Hebrews 13.3,

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.849
which beautiful scripture, keep in mind those in prison

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:20.050
as though you were imprisoned with them.

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:21.289
Now, isn't that interesting?

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:25.849
Keep in mind those in prison as though you were imprisoned with them.

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:28.330
Now, let's go to Isaiah 41,

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:32.969
and we'll get our second example of how Jehovah can use his hand.

00:03:32.969 --> 00:03:38.449
Isaiah 41, verse 10, the B part, Jehovah says,

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:45.650
I will really hold onto you with my right hand of righteousness.

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:48.889
Then look at verse 13, for I, Jehovah your God,

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:52.810
am grasping your right hand.

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:57.689
The one saying to you, do not be afraid, I will help you.

00:03:57.689 --> 00:04:01.250
Now, interestingly, this scripture is not talking about Jehovah

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:05.090
taking his right hand and grabbing our left hand

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.729
as would be true in walking side by side.

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:11.009
But rather, Jehovah takes his right hand and grabs our right hand

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:16.329
as would be true of Jehovah pulling us up and out of a pit.

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:18.529
So what do we learn from this?

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:23.529
That Jehovah can rescue us from any situation,

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:29.129
no matter how hopeless, how desperate it might seem.

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:31.850
But now, a question, how can we work in harmony

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:35.649
with this specific use of Jehovah's hand?

00:04:35.649 --> 00:04:39.329
Well, for one thing, we can supplicate Jehovah

00:04:39.329 --> 00:04:44.329
to rescue us in time of test trial, temptation.

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:49.050
And then we can avail ourselves of the help that comes our way

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.290
in effect reaching out with our right hand

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:54.209
and grasping Jehovah's right hand.

00:04:54.209 --> 00:04:57.889
But now, let's go to Psalm 145, our third example.

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:04.170
Psalm 145, verse number 16 of Jehovah,

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:07.889
it says, you open your hand

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:12.810
and satisfy the desire of every living thing.

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:14.810
Now, what is this telling us?

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:19.810
Well, Jehovah can use his hand to express tremendous generosity.

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:22.810
It's true, this scripture will be completely fulfilled

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:24.889
in the new world, but even now,

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:29.209
Jehovah freely uses his hand to express generosity.

00:05:29.209 --> 00:05:33.449
He is the most magnanimous giver in the universe.

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:37.569
Nothing stingy or tightfisted about Jehovah.

00:05:37.569 --> 00:05:41.769
He gives emotionally, he gives materially,

00:05:41.769 --> 00:05:43.850
especially spiritually.

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:47.129
The ground we walk on, the food we eat,

00:05:47.129 --> 00:05:50.930
the air we breathe, all come from Jehovah.

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:54.290
That makes me think of the atheist who arrogantly said,

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:59.290
I don't need God, I don't need anybody, I don't need anything.

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:05.730
And then he took a deep breath, how short-sighted indeed.

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:10.930
But now our question is, how can we work in harmony

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:13.209
with this use of Jehovah's hand?

00:06:13.209 --> 00:06:15.689
Well, by being generous toward others,

00:06:15.689 --> 00:06:19.370
being willing to give unstentingly

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:22.730
of our time, energy, resources.

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:26.850
And think about this, if we are close-fisted with others,

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:30.209
not only are we not imitating our generous God,

00:06:30.209 --> 00:06:33.810
as beloved children, but Jehovah can't put anything

00:06:33.889 --> 00:06:35.170
in our hand.

00:06:36.529 --> 00:06:40.730
On the other hand, if we're open-handed,

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:45.730
with others, now Jehovah can put something in our hand.

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:49.730
Well, let's identify one more way Jehovah uses his hand.

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:54.720
Let's go to Exodus chapter 15, please.

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:58.680
And verse six, the B part.

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:03.680
Your right hand, O Jehovah, can shatter an enemy.

00:07:05.319 --> 00:07:06.879
What do we learn?

00:07:06.879 --> 00:07:09.439
He reminds us of how many times in the past,

00:07:09.439 --> 00:07:12.519
Jehovah has used his hand to smash

00:07:12.519 --> 00:07:16.000
to irreparable pieces his enemies.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
And it assures us he will do so

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.079
in an even more awe-inspiring way in the near future

00:07:23.079 --> 00:07:25.040
during the great tribulation.

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:29.600
Jehovah will use his hand to maneuver many of the wicked,

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:34.319
to actually use their physical hands to slaughter each other.

00:07:34.319 --> 00:07:38.879
And then he will use his hand to wheel the forces of nature,

00:07:38.879 --> 00:07:43.319
to use the immortal Christ, the immortal 144,000,

00:07:43.319 --> 00:07:48.319
the mighty angels, he will use them to sweep away,

00:07:48.959 --> 00:07:52.160
sweep out of existence the rest of the wicked,

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:55.120
along with this entire wicked system.

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:59.639
How can we work in harmony with this use of Jehovah's hand?

00:07:59.639 --> 00:08:03.319
Well, one way, very important, we can work hard

00:08:03.319 --> 00:08:07.600
to help people take a stand with Jehovah, learn the truth,

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:12.600
so they don't have to be removed by Jehovah's Almighty hand.

00:08:12.879 --> 00:08:16.600
And this brings great delight to Jehovah when we do this,

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:18.959
because Jehovah takes no delight

00:08:18.959 --> 00:08:21.199
and even the death of the wicked.

00:08:21.199 --> 00:08:24.019
But what he takes delight in is that someone wicked

00:08:24.019 --> 00:08:27.639
turns back from his way and keeps living.

00:08:28.639 --> 00:08:31.639
Well, we have now discussed four ways

00:08:31.639 --> 00:08:34.840
Jehovah can use his awe-inspiring hand,

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:39.159
maneuver government officials, according to his will,

00:08:39.159 --> 00:08:44.159
rescue his people, give generously, shatter his enemies.

00:08:45.559 --> 00:08:48.019
Now the Bible does describe many other ways

00:08:48.019 --> 00:08:49.919
Jehovah uses his hand.

00:08:49.919 --> 00:08:53.279
So why not make identifying some of these other ways

00:08:53.279 --> 00:08:55.080
a future study project?

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:57.399
I'll give you a little bit of homework,

00:08:57.399 --> 00:09:02.399
but may all of us be determined to use our physical

00:09:03.159 --> 00:09:07.039
and figurative hand to always work in harmony

00:09:07.039 --> 00:09:10.840
with Jehovah's awe-inspiring hand.
