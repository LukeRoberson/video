00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:09.919
At Isaiah 40 verses 4 and 5, Jehovah says he would remove seemingly insurmountable obstacles

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:13.220
so the Jews could return to Jerusalem.

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:20.760
The account says, let every valley be raised up and every mountain and hill be made low.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.719
The rough ground must become level and the rugged ground of valley plain.

00:00:25.719 --> 00:00:31.600
The glory of Jehovah will be revealed and all flesh will see it together for the mouth

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.320
of Jehovah has spoken.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.799
This inspiring prophecy was initially fulfilled in 537 BCE.

00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:46.479
There is nothing that can stand in the way of what Jehovah wants accomplished.

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:52.359
In this report, we will seek clear evidence of Jehovah's support on theocratic projects

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:53.880
today.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:01:00.200
Despite a pandemic, supply chain shortages and other challenges.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:06.840
For example, the February 2020 announcement featured in the JW newsroom informed us that

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:13.879
the Cameroon Branch Relocation Project finished shortly before the outbreak of COVID-19.

00:01:13.879 --> 00:01:19.239
Just in time, the Bethel family had a home where they could safely shelter in place during

00:01:19.239 --> 00:01:25.439
the pandemic and still care for the Kingdom work and more than 48,000 publishers in that

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.719
branch territory.

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:33.439
The Argentina Bethel family also moved into their new branch facility in Buenos Aires shortly

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:34.680
thereafter.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:41.079
The move which was organized in compliance with COVID-19 safety protocols began in July

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:42.079
2021.

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:48.840
The Bethel family saw numerous examples of Jehovah leveling out overwhelming challenges

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.159
during the pandemic.

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:57.400
A successful completion of the new branch facilities in the midst of that turmoil has already

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.319
given a great witness to the community.

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:07.719
It has allowed the Bethel family to focus on caring for close to 170,000 publishers in

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:10.479
that branch territory.

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:16.960
What a blessing to have these new facilities to support the Kingdom Preaching Work.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.479
What about projects happening right now?

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:30.180
Listen closely as we hear updates from brothers in Italy, Congo and Angola.

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.460
The Italy branch is relocating its facilities to the city of Bologna in Northern Italy,

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:41.699
which is located about 370 kilometers or 230 miles from Rome.

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:48.620
Initially, the construction project committee wanted to use her brothers and sisters as volunteers.

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:55.500
However, at a certain point, it was decided to rely on an outside development company, both

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:01.139
for the design and renovation of the office building that was purchased, as well as for

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:06.530
the design and construction of the residential buildings.

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.370
When this decision was made, we did not imagine that a few months afterwards we would not

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.090
be able to use our volunteers.

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:21.490
Because at the beginning of 2020, COVID-19 struck Northern Italy, including the city of Bologna.

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:29.169
As a consequence, the government suspended activities, including construction.

00:03:29.169 --> 00:03:32.729
After about one month, they lifted the restrictions.

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:38.810
And as a result, we could get back in touch with the companies and continue the work, while

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:45.009
respecting government protocol and direction from our organization.

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:50.490
Thanks to Jehovah's direction, despite the pandemic, we are happy to see how this project

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:54.169
is moving forward much faster than we expected.

00:03:54.169 --> 00:04:00.969
And we look forward to being able to move into these new buildings by the end of 2024.

00:04:00.969 --> 00:04:09.129
In 2012, we had a little over 168,000 publishers in our branch territory.

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:17.329
By the end of 2021, the total number of publishers grew to more than 209,000 publishers.

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:22.089
Because it was in practical to expand the branch facility in Kinchasa, we looked for

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:27.850
a property that could care for the immediate and future needs of the branch.

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:33.889
We purchased property in the country's second largest city, Lubumbashi, where a developer

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:37.810
was already building housing and office units.

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:44.209
The developer already had the zoning, permits, and completed design packages.

00:04:44.209 --> 00:04:49.850
This saved much time and allowed the projects to move ahead with minimal disruption, even

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:51.490
during the pandemic.

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.970
And we were happy for that.

00:04:53.970 --> 00:05:00.370
For the internal work of the new offices, we needed a contractor who could design and

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:06.250
install to the standards of our organization, and within the project budget.

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:11.730
We knew this would be hard to find in Congo, and even harder with the limitations of the

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:13.569
pandemic.

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:19.449
One of the suppliers that we use for food and relief supplies in the area, mentioned

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:25.009
to us that they have a partner company who specializes in construction and is newly

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:27.009
active in the country.

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:32.769
We didn't expect that the answer to this challenge would come from this unusual direction.

00:05:32.769 --> 00:05:38.370
But we were surprised to find that they did in fact qualify to meet the high standards

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:42.050
and expectations of such a branch project.

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:48.329
As the relationship grew, we saw fine collaboration between our teams, and they continue to work

00:05:48.329 --> 00:05:52.329
along with us now as the project expands.

00:05:52.329 --> 00:05:58.370
We truly have seen Jehovah smoothing out the path for this project.

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:03.370
We have already started moving some Bethelites to this new site, and look forward to the

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:08.870
project's completion in mid-2024.

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:16.189
In December 2021, a building was purchased that will provide additional rooms and offices

00:06:16.189 --> 00:06:20.829
for the Bethel family at our branch.

00:06:20.829 --> 00:06:26.750
This building is located about a 10-minute walk from the current Bethel facility.

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:33.910
Because of the restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the entire process for the acquisition

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:39.990
of this building, even including the verification of the legal aspects, had to be done by video

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:42.790
conference.

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:48.230
During the last week of the negotiation process, when there were just five days remaining

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:53.829
to sign the purchase and sale agreement, and during a stage in which the negotiation

00:06:53.829 --> 00:06:59.790
team from the branch in the seller had already agreed on the purchase and sale price,

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:05.670
we discovered that the structure of the building needed some repairs and reinforcements in

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:07.750
some areas.

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:13.519
How did the team negotiating the purchase handle this obstacle?

00:07:13.519 --> 00:07:19.759
The seller was asked to take responsibility for the repairs, and to reinforce the building

00:07:19.759 --> 00:07:27.959
structure, closely following the engineering details that would be provided by the branch.

00:07:27.959 --> 00:07:36.040
After several prayers by the branch's negotiation team, the seller accepted the responsibility,

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:43.529
and even paid for all the expenses involved in this repair.

00:07:43.529 --> 00:07:49.769
The repair was completed, and shortly after, the work to completely renovate the building

00:07:49.769 --> 00:07:51.889
began.

00:07:51.889 --> 00:07:57.649
We look forward to seeing some of the Bethel family move into this new building in early

00:07:57.649 --> 00:08:00.730
2024.

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:07.490
In addition to these new branch facilities, we also have many other needs to fill.

00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:12.370
For example, in order to train brothers and sisters to carry out the preaching and

00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:18.329
teaching work, there continues to be a need for theocratic school facilities.

00:08:18.329 --> 00:08:24.410
In Madagascar, the branch hosted classes at Bethel because they didn't have any other

00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:26.649
suitable facilities.

00:08:26.649 --> 00:08:33.169
Well in June 2021, they finished construction of a new school facility, and will now be

00:08:33.169 --> 00:08:37.809
able to schedule up to four classes there each year.

00:08:37.809 --> 00:08:44.009
Currently, there are over 40 existing school facilities, and we have around 20 active school

00:08:44.009 --> 00:08:50.149
facility projects at various stages of development.

00:08:50.149 --> 00:08:54.750
What about facilities to support the growing media production of the organization?

00:08:54.750 --> 00:09:00.669
We're happy to report that we have finished the studio projects at the South Africa and

00:09:00.669 --> 00:09:02.629
Australasia branches.

00:09:02.629 --> 00:09:07.870
In Australasia, that includes the backlog that is used for the good news according to

00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:10.149
Jesus' video series.

00:09:10.629 --> 00:09:17.190
Soon, if Jehovah wills, we will begin construction on the new site in Ramippo, New York.

00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:22.629
We look forward to seeing how Jehovah uses this facility to care for the needs of his

00:09:22.629 --> 00:09:24.509
people.

00:09:24.509 --> 00:09:31.429
It is clear that neither the pandemic nor ongoing turmoil in this world has been able

00:09:31.429 --> 00:09:35.110
to stop theocratic building projects.

00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:42.549
And as world conditions continue to deteriorate, we are confident that the words of Isaiah 44

00:09:42.549 --> 00:09:45.309
and 5 will be true for us.

00:09:45.309 --> 00:09:52.389
Yes, Jehovah will help us overcome any mountain-like obstacles that we face.

00:09:52.389 --> 00:09:58.870
We earnestly pray for Jehovah to bless these and future building projects.

00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:04.710
And we thank you, dear brothers and sisters, for supporting them by means of your

00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:10.389
prayers, skills, time, and resources.

00:10:10.389 --> 00:10:17.950
May all praise and glory go to our great God, Jehovah, who continues to clear the way for

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:18.549
us.
