00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:06.269
Well, perhaps you found it comforting to read the thought in our comments that bearing fruit

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.449
Cannot refer to new disciples who we may be privileged to make and for good reason

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:18.750
Because we all have different circumstances. We preach in different territories, and we do it under different conditions

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.589
But instead the fruit we bear according to John 15 to

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:26.109
refers to our activity

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:33.390
Approaching the good news and this is clearly an activity that Jesus and his father are very interested in

00:00:34.189 --> 00:00:38.350
It was mentioned, but you notice how Jesus emphasized this point again in verse 8

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:40.509
He says

00:00:40.509 --> 00:00:45.630
My father is glorified in this that you keep bearing much fruit

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:49.229
and prove yourselves my disciples

00:00:50.509 --> 00:00:54.990
So our activity brings praise and glory to Jehovah

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:59.950
So within the limits of our individual circumstances

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.670
You and I should look for ways to keep bearing fruit

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.230
In other words, we should be looking for ways to keep progressing

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.510
in our activity as Christian ministers

00:01:13.629 --> 00:01:15.629
Well, how do we do that?

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.549
Well, we know that our ministry is part of our spiritual warfare

00:01:20.349 --> 00:01:25.790
So let's just discuss this progression by comparing spiritual warfare

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.670
to physical warfare

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.549
And we'll do this by looking at a particular group of warriors the Benjaminites

00:01:34.269 --> 00:01:39.549
Now, let's just note one similar characteristic. Turn with me please the judges chapter 20

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:45.709
In judges chapter 20

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.959
Noverse 16

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:54.719
It says in this army were 700 chosen men who were left-handed

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.879
Every one of these men could sling a stone to within a hair breath and would not miss

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:09.120
Well, clearly these chosen men were highly accurate in hitting their mark

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.560
What do you think would be involved in developing this level of accuracy?

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.520
Well, no one reference works stated

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.599
It said

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:26.000
These men fought a specialized course because the sling required a much higher level of intensive training

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:31.280
The sling had to be practiced from childhood to achieve an adequate level of proficiency

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:39.759
Therefore, cultures with a heritage of mastering the sling began the instruction as early as possible

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.919
Now when you think about that and we think about our heritage as God's servants

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.360
Isn't it true that one of the first things we learn early on is to read

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.439
study

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:56.080
and be proficient in our use of God's word

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:01.120
And this is something that we're encouraged to do daily not just to help ourselves

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:03.520
But to help others as well

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:08.800
We know when we take the time to study and get the sense of what we read

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.439
We see the benefits. It strengthens our faith

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.800
We gain an accurate knowledge of what the Bible teaches

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.759
And then we work to convey that message accurately to others

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:23.439
We recognize the power of God's word

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:28.960
And we let the Bible serve as the authority as we speak to others

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.759
It reminds me of a sister who was approached by a man who wanted to know why she was one of Jehovah's Witnesses

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:37.919
And why Jehovah's Witnesses preach

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:43.439
So as she was explaining to him she pulled out her Bible and he stops her and he says no no no no

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:48.560
Don't don't show me anything from the Bible just just speak from your heart

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:52.159
And as this is said well, I can't do that

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.360
And he says no you need to understand the Bible is just the book. It's a nice guide

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:02.240
And she said well actually it's much more than that if you let it

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.960
So he agreed to read second Timothy chapter three verse 16 and 17

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.639
And as she was explaining the verse to him

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.360
The man just stood there silent

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:15.439
Just staring at the verse

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:17.759
Finally he said

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.480
I've never seen this before

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:23.279
That's pretty good

00:04:23.519 --> 00:04:26.160
Then he pulls out his phone and says you mind if I take a picture of that

00:04:27.519 --> 00:04:31.279
Well clearly what he read had an impact on him

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.079
And the more proficient we are in using God's word accurately

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:42.879
The better chance we'll have of hitting the mark hitting the heart of our listeners

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.800
Let's note another characteristic of the Benjaminites this time in the book of first chronicles

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:58.449
First chronicles chapter 12 and we'll read first chronicles 12 verse 2

00:05:02.189 --> 00:05:03.790
It says they were armed with the bow

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:10.350
And they could use both the right hand and the left hand to sling stones or to shoot arrows with the bow

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:14.750
They were of the brothers of Saul from Benjamin

00:05:16.959 --> 00:05:21.279
The skill level of the Benjaminites allowed them to be adaptable

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.959
So whether it was a change in hand or a change in weapon

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:27.120
It didn't matter

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.120
They were equipped to

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.600
Meet any attack from either side

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:36.240
I can you imagine what an advantage that most have given them

00:05:37.839 --> 00:05:39.839
Well in a similar sense

00:05:40.079 --> 00:05:45.279
We too don't want to be defeated by any initial objections we may encounter

00:05:45.839 --> 00:05:52.079
So we must look for the best ways to be adaptable the best way to get our message across

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:56.079
And using the teaching toolbox is a great help

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:02.240
Because the toolbox is designed in such a way where each tool has a specific purpose

00:06:02.959 --> 00:06:06.240
So we have to think about our objective what are we looking to do

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.240
Are we looking to introduce ourselves and our work to someone?

00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:12.879
Well, we have various tools for that

00:06:13.759 --> 00:06:16.079
Or perhaps we're speaking with some of our family members

00:06:16.079 --> 00:06:19.439
And we're looking for ways to stimulate their interest or teach them the truth

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.160
Well, we have tools for that as well

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:25.839
The point is we can use various tools

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:27.759
To help us adapt

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:30.639
According to the need

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.839
Have something else that can help prize you noticed on the website

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:40.240
How the topics featured on the homepage are adapted to present circumstances

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:45.360
You think about at the start of this pandemic the magazine featured was disease

00:06:45.839 --> 00:06:47.839
How to reduce the risk

00:06:47.839 --> 00:06:49.839
But then as world events developed

00:06:50.639 --> 00:06:52.639
We saw more articles

00:06:53.279 --> 00:06:56.639
How to deal with anxiety is protest the answer

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:00.240
Well in a similar way we can do the same

00:07:00.959 --> 00:07:05.279
If we keep up with current events if we adapt our message to present circumstances

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:09.600
Well, certainly that's an excellent way to get our message across

00:07:11.199 --> 00:07:16.000
Well, in just these two verses there's no question. We've seen the Benjamin knights were mighty

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:19.680
Highly skilled warriors with a unique skill set

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:23.120
But here's a question

00:07:23.439 --> 00:07:26.240
Did that skill guarantee them victory

00:07:27.279 --> 00:07:32.850
Every time they fought if we go back to judges chapter 20

00:07:34.449 --> 00:07:40.290
This chapter details and account where the Benjamin knights refused to hand over to their Israelite brothers

00:07:40.689 --> 00:07:43.490
The perpetrators of a morally disgraceful act

00:07:44.449 --> 00:07:47.009
So the tribes of Israel decided to

00:07:47.649 --> 00:07:49.410
Band together and wage war

00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:52.050
Against the Benjamin knights for their crime

00:07:53.009 --> 00:07:55.569
Now even though the Benjamin knights had quite the army

00:07:56.129 --> 00:08:00.930
When those tribes came together and put their full trust and reliance in Jehovah

00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:04.290
Look at verse 35 what happened

00:08:05.329 --> 00:08:08.769
It's a Jehovah defeated Benjamin before Israel

00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:15.649
And on that day the Israelite struck down 25,100 men and Benjamin all of them armed with swords

00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:18.930
So Jehovah gave them the victory

00:08:20.209 --> 00:08:22.209
But what do we take away from that?

00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:25.410
We learned that it does not matter how much skill

00:08:26.529 --> 00:08:30.689
Ability or talent we may have in our ministry

00:08:31.889 --> 00:08:33.649
in our work

00:08:33.649 --> 00:08:35.490
Or any other theocratic assignment

00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:39.250
None of us can be victorious and bear fruit

00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:43.169
If our relationship with Jehovah is not intact

00:08:45.149 --> 00:08:51.950
As was mentioned bearing fruit also involves manifesting aspects of the fruitage of the spirit to a greater degree

00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:56.029
So it's imperative it's important especially now

00:08:56.669 --> 00:09:05.070
That we work to develop and manifest these qualities qualities that can help us to remain clean to have an approved standing before Jehovah

00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:09.710
But these qualities can also help us to be obedient

00:09:10.669 --> 00:09:14.590
And to also follow the direction of those taking the lead

00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:18.610
As we speak about bearing fruit

00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:22.610
It may be that we see this as a challenge

00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:26.289
We may perhaps feel that our circumstances

00:09:26.929 --> 00:09:29.409
Have limited our service to Jehovah

00:09:30.769 --> 00:09:35.889
Well if we feel that way be assured that Jehovah understands our limitations

00:09:36.289 --> 00:09:39.009
He certainly does not want any of us to feel pressured

00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:41.889
He only wants us to do the best we can

00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:44.929
Within the limits of our circumstances

00:09:46.370 --> 00:09:49.809
But he certainly appreciates any effort we put forth

00:09:50.529 --> 00:09:54.129
And as we've considered when we work to be proficient

00:09:54.769 --> 00:09:56.769
In our accurate use of his word

00:09:57.169 --> 00:10:00.210
When we strive to be adaptable as our ministry allows

00:10:00.769 --> 00:10:03.809
And when we work to develop qualities that are pleasing to him

00:10:04.769 --> 00:10:10.049
Then we can be assured that we are fulfilling our commission to keep bearing fruit

00:10:10.929 --> 00:10:13.409
All to Jehovah's glory and praise
